“What About That Class Reunion?”

Davidson Huskies Defeat
Clemson and S.C.

University

Track Team Wins in Thrilling Meets.
Murrey, Brice, and Dick Star
For Red and Black.

By the close score of 51 to 48
Davidson won the track meet held |
with the University of South Caro-
lina at Columbia last Tuesday. The
meet was fast and unusually good, ,
the outcome of the contest being.
uncertain until the finish of the last
event. Brice won the deciding event
when he passed Captain Mann, of
the Palmetto State team, on the last
few yards of the 220 hurdles.

The time was very good, and the
weight events featured. Murray led’
for Davidson by a count of 19 points, |
winning first place in three events, ,
second in one, and tied for third in:
another. He was also the largest
individual scorer of the meet. Brice |;
came second for Davidson with a to-
tal of 11 points, and Dick won two
first places, gathering in a total of
10 points and a “D.” Sutton whirl-
ed the discus for a distance of 112!
feet, giving the college record of 114
feet a bad scare. Gentry and Green

_ being pitted against more than their
match, had to be content with a tie
for third place in one event, and!
Denniston almost won his letter, se-
curing a second and a third place.
The Davidson track team won in six:
events out of a possible eleven.

For the Palmetto State track
team Seaborn had the highest count
of 15 points, taking one first, tieing
for another and two seconds. Smith
was second with 7 points. Waite
featured in the shotput, throwing it
to the distance of 39 feet. The S.C.
team made a clean sweep of two
events, the shot put and pole vault,
as the Davidson team had very little
training in either of these. The Da-
vidson. athletes made the highest
average individual score of the two
teams as both entered an equal num-
ber of contestants.

Gamma Sigma Epsilon to Be Title of
New Organization. Smaller Col-
leges to Be Eligible For
Chapters.

The founding and the organiza-
tion of the Gamma Sigma_Epsilon
Chemical Fraternity at Davidson

1913 when Dr. Martin was professor |
of chemistry, a club was formed
among the students who were inter- ;
ested in the fine and mysterious arts
of alchemy. This society has strug: ,
gled through lean and flourished in
rich years until now under the name
of the Analyst Club it is merged in- |
to the Gamma Sigma Epsilon. All|
members of this old club are eligi- |
ble for membership in the fraternity. |

Of the two remaining chemical!
fraternities, one is entirely honor- |
ary, while the other is altogether
technical. Neither of these frater-
nities are interested in extending to
smaller colleges. Yet it is among
these so-called “lesser schools” that
the need for men of science to get
together is most imperative. Tor
help and encouragement is quite es-
sential during those very years.
Fraternities such as the Phi Beta
Kappa and the Sigma Upsilon stim-
ulate interest in scholarship and lit-
erary achievements. Yet the chem-
ist burdened with his long evenings
of laboratory work receives no re-
ward. It is the purpose of the Gam- |
ma Sigma Epsilon to fill this gap. |

Abounding with a spirit of service
for and devotion to the betterment
of mankind, the Gamma Sigma Ep-
silon proposes to bring that class of
men who have contributed so ex-
tensively to the advancement of the
human race into closer union and
fellowship. This fraternity lays’ no
claims to having found the “Prim-
rose path” in chemistry, however, it.
can and will make the way more
pleasant and congenial for the chem-
ist.

After being rained out on the pre-
vious day at Guilford, the Wildcats
journeyed to Raleigh to face their
rivals from N. C. State. The game
was slow and lacking in spectacular
plays. Davidson fell down on easy
chances and five errors on the in-
field’s part gave the Teck lads
enough leeway to push the neces-
sary tallies across. Currie pitched a
consistent game and with any sup-
port would have gotten out of the
fracas with a better result. The
“Big Boy” caused nine opposing
batters to retire via the strike-out
route and kept their six hits well
scattered, The winners scored in the

President R. M. Miller Urges All
Members to Be Present. Impor-
tant Subjects to Be

Discussed.

Just a Word to the Alumni.

I want to join with The Davidson-
ian in an appeal to the Alumni for
the largest attendance in the his-
tory of the association, during the
coming commencement.

Our alma mater is on the eve of
a wonderful new era—in expansion
development — and the an-
nouncements to be made at com-
mencement will fill our hearts with
great joy and gratitude.

The time and the occasion will be
opportune for the establishment of
closer relations between the college
and its authorities and the Alumni
Association, which relations, to my
mind, are not as close as the condi-
tions warrant. We are a part and
parcel of the college, we are an as-
set, and the greater the preserva-
tion of an asset, the greater is the
possibility of success.

After four years of service to the
association—poor as that service
may prove—I am convinced that the
college and the alumni must get to-
gether, stay together and work to-
gether, if our hope for a still greater
and better Davidson is to be real-
ized,

Our meeting is set for 6 p. m.
sharp, on Tuesday of commence-
ment, which will give us some three
hours for our discussion and in ad-
dition, we are promised that we will
have no interference or interruption
during this time allotted to us.

We hope that the meeting will be,
as it should be, one of the largest,
most. enjoyable and enthusiastic in
the life of the association.

President.
