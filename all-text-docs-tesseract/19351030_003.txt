SPEAKS ON SALVATION

Students Enjoy Lecture On ‘The
Questions t Were Put
To ist”

TEXT TAKEN FROM LUKE

Urges Students To Put Sermon’s
Meaning Into Practice

The Reverend A,
of the First Presbyterian Church of
Lenoir, N. C., spoke at the College Ves-
per Services in Chambers Auditorium
Sunday night, October 27.

He selected his text from Luke XIII,
23, “Lord are they few that are saved?”
He explained that many questions were
put to Christ—some out of curiosity,
some in earnestness, and some in an en-
deavor to catch Christ. He said that
Christ never failed to answer these ques-
tions and in answering takes one word
and explains the question in terms of
that word.

Reverend McLean went on and showed
that Jesus answered this question with
the word “Salvation;” answering it in
three parts. The first of these was that
it is difficult to be saved—difficult to ac-
knowledge Jesus as our Savior, it takes
courage to declare God and to show we
are his followers, and it it hard to pray
as we are unable to remove common
everyday obstacles that are in our way.
The second was ‘There ‘no second
chance.” “We decide our fate for eter-
nity while we are alive on this planet
and after death we have to live what
we have decided on this earth,” said the
Reverend McLean. Men often underes-
timate Sin and the kitidness of
causing their downfall. The third answer
concerning Salvation is “No person
saved by any rank, title, or race,” but
only by faith.” He claimed that the
Americans think they are the best race
in the world, but in the sight of
they are no better than any other race.

He closed his sermon by urging every-
body to put these things into their every-
day life and habits.
