In view of the various interpretations
and misinterpretations which have been
given to the article “Why, Does Not the
Council Act?” it is only fair to the col-
lege that the author make clear the ideas
hw hich he seemingly beclouded with
words.

In the first place, it seems entirely
proper that the Forum should be the
place for “free speech.” An editorial
should be unsigned. In fact, a paper can
be more valuable thru its editorial com-
ments on the news reported in its col-
lumns, if the “personal element” does
not enter into the matter. The forum
represents, however, the student opinion
rather than the newspaper opinion. The
paper cannot be responsible for — these.
For that reason McIlwaine is correct in

saying that such opinions—whether in
the form of satire or what not—should
be signed.

“Free speech" is a valuable thing.
Sociologists represent it as having a very
definite function in murderers’ society.
It has a definite function at Davidson.
Often incorrect speech is better than no
speech at all. In a democracy the most
insignificant man should criticise the
leader. Responsibility to the mass and
criticism of the mob prevents the social
form from crystalizing. It was this be-
lief that gave rise to the article referred

17 to.

South all the time In the second place, the article was

Tryon not intended to be the final word or ta
ry he based on superhuman information.

It was purposely one-sided, aiming more
to produce comment than to settle the
matter. [It was based on student opin-
ion, not on facts. Every ‘‘fact” named,
however, was a matter of student gossip
and belief. The writer did not believe
oI of these were true. And he set forth
the false “facts” in the hope that the en-
suing discussion would bring forth the
true facts.

In the third place, the article was not
a statement that there is a vast amount
of drinking in Davidson, “Vhere is some
drinking here. “The paper was estab-
lished to discuss facts and not to hide
them from its subscribers. According to
the definition by the “State Law,” there
is a survival of hazing here. ‘There is
some cheating here. There is some gam-
bling here. But no one believes more
sincerely than the writer that these
things are gradually passing out of our
life—in so far as they will ever pass out

for the intend to introduce the question of

whether a college man should be per-
mitted to drink. It claimed the drink-
ing was against the standard set by the
faculty ; and against the laws of the con-
stitution. It suggested that no under-
graduate body is able to decide just
what the ethical standard of a college
should be; that therefore the legislative
portion of college government should be
left to the faculty and the judicial tu the
student body. Because of his imma-
turity the writer was, and still is, un-
prepared to make any statement regard-
ing morality.

In the fifth place. the article was not
discussing merely the question of drink
ing. There isa rhetorical difference be-
tween the “occasion” of an article and
the “purpose” of an article. So far the
discussion has tended to center around
the occasion—which happened to be a
drinking case. Saunders is eminently

forced. A judicial committee has no
right to hesitate to enforce the law. It
has no right to even think of the person-
ality of the defendant. A law is abso-
lute and a judicial committee is a mere
automaton in its grasp. If a law is in-
correct it should be revised or taken off
the book; but so long as it exists, a law
must be enforced.

Another purpose of the article was to
claim that under our present constitu-
tion this is very difficult. Our council
must first interpret the law and then
enforce it. In a sense, only a judicial
body must do this, But in most cases
the law is so definite that the opportunity
for variation in interpretation is reduce |
to a minimum. When there is occasion
for considerable variety in interpretation,
the judicial body becomes combined
with the legislative body. They must
first legislate in interpreting the law and
later judge the question of guilt.

Take the question of hazing, for ex-
ample, remembering that it is not the
only question capable of discussion!
Suppose a man is introduced into the
council as guilty. He has paddled 3
Freshman. According to our law, if he
is guilty he must be expelled. A council-
man raises the question whether pad-
dling in a spirit of friendship is “haz-
ing;” and whether it is a bad practice,
Every year that problem comes up and
the council must legislite before it can
judge. One reason why the council does
so little is that it can never come to an
agreement regarding its legislative pol-

And my throbbing pulse beats faster,
Quickened now at her command,
I'd gladly give my drop of blood
To save the honor of my land.

And yet, the strife will not be long:
The troops will soon disband.
A reign of love is just begun:
The Prince of Peace will then com-
mand.

So let us up and to the front—
Our country needs us too;

With hearts of love, with hate to none.
Be soldiers, brave and kind and true.
