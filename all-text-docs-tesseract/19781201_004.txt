Good news

’ This week there is good news.
Long drop-add lines have stirred anew
the student grumblings over Davidson’s
course registration system. This term,
however, ‘someone is listening.

The committee established this week by
Vice President Zimmermann to study
course registration may finally plumb the
muddy depths-of this complex problem.
Setting up a committee is no guarantee
that all will soon be well, but it is certainly
astute. of ‘Zimmermann to recognize that

‘Not so very ‘orig ago we were told that

the Davidson faculty would never approve
a plan for a Tenure Committee. “Davidson

professors harbor a historical reluctance:

to judge their peers,” advised the skeptics.
Yet through: careful compromise and
consensus-building, the Professional Af-
fairs Committee and Vice President Zim-
mermann seem to have fashioned a
proposal for a tenure committee that
stands a fair chance of preliminary faculty
approval next week. If the Tenure Commit-
tee is approved, thé passage of the Code
of Evaluation will likely soon fallow.
‘And: then: it ‘may be: possible for

_ Davidson to cease viewing the adminstra-

tion as “the boss” and the: faculty as “the

-” employees” and, instead, accept both

jors and faculty as partners in

‘ the ‘educational mission.

‘We: encourage the. fagulty | to turn a

s, . favorable ear to the proposed Tenure

Committee and. “set ‘Davidson on this
worthy course.

The memo war

You may not know it, but there’s a
Memo War going on.

From the gym this week there surfaced,
printed.on bright yellow paper, a “NOTICE
TO ALL STUDENTS, FACULTY AND
STAFF” concerning. ticket. pickup policy
for Davidson’s: basketball games. in Char-
lotte this:season. After reading through an. -
innocuous first- “paragraph, ‘we come to a
“SPECIAL NOTICE.”

That special notice tells us that “each
student must pick up his_or her’ ticket
individually upon. ntation of an ID
card at the Athletic Office. A student may
not pick up another student's complimen-
tary ticket, even with the latter's ID card.”

What does that mean to you, the
Davidson basketball fan? It means that
this bright yellow memo cuts out the
tradition of collecting your and a dozen of
your friends’ IDs, walking down to the gym
at your Convenience, and picking up a
whole batch of tickets so you and your
friends can sit together at the game, In the
past, fraternities.have used this “one picks
up for p= ala to gather entire

Spencer vowed that he knew nothing of
The Memo, that he was party to no plot

which denied students their inalienable

ticket rights. He vowed to look into the
matter.

And that he did. ‘The very next morning
Spencer issued a Gounter-Memo. “NO-
TICE TO. ALL DAVIDSON STUDENTS:

Provisions: have been made for Davidson

students who will be in the area over the
holidays to attend the Davidson-Duke
basketball game. on January 2. Compli-
mentary tickets will be available by
registering, upon presentation of an ID
card, at the Athletic Ticket Office on
December 14 only. Students who register
for these tickets in the above manner may

-pick them up at the Davidson ticket

window at the Coliseum the night of the
game, again upon presentation of an ID

card.”

Touche. Spencer's Counter-Memo out-
ranks the gym’s Memo.and the matter is”
settled. Students can get free tickets for
the Duke game. Dandy.

But wait. Can anything be done about |

supposed to solve all the. problems.

Finding alternatives

By PAM CAMERRA
Executive Editor

Tired of being at Davidson?
Unmotivated and uninspired?
Filling. out transfer applica-
tions? The initial thrill of being
a freshman is over and sopho-
mores and juniors still have a
long way to go before they can
graduate.

The prospect of coming back
to two and a half months of
rain, of old classes, term papers
and reviews, after three weeks
of vacation, appears bleak.

Winter’s dampness and cold
only add to‘students’ feeling of
restlessness and thoughts of
leaving here.

There were many times in the
past two and a half years when I
thought I could not stand being
at Davidson one moment lon-
ger. I felt as though I had
stopped growing. Academically
T had done well, but what I was

people and having nothing to
talk about except the obvious or
trivial |

I was also dissatisfied with
the College community itself.
Were students and faculty at
other colleges and universities
such a conservative, apathetic
lot? I had tried to effect change
by working with The Davidso-
nian. But_it was like banging
one’s head against a brick wall.

I continued to watch people
such as Dr. Linden and Dr.
Devon treated unjustly. I
watched the faculty and admi-
nistration quietly accept what
was going on.

Moreover, little effort was
being made to recruit a more
diverse student body, or faculty
or to fight the discriminatory
and conservative attitudes to-
ward women and blacks.

Unwilling to accept the place
and the. people, I began to

explore the possibilities of going

somewhere else

For many the only answer
is to transfer. However, in some
respects, that is the easy way
out. It means giving up the
fight. It assumes that there are
no other alternatives available.
tives available.

Furthermore, it seems that in
colleges all over the country
students are frustrated by ad-

ministrators, by apathy, by |

conservatism. Reading over the |
Williams Record and Wesleyan
Argus, I found that these
schools have very similar pro.
blems.

The only other viable option
that I looked into was David-
son’s junior year abroad pro-
grams. However I discovered
there were many other opportu-
nities. ~

It is not necessary to be
restricted to Davidson’s pro-
grams (though one might avoid
some red tape by doing so.) It
may not be beneficial to partici-
pate in a program with people
you already know. Nor is it
always necessary to go away for
the whole year. There are
semester and term programs in.
places all over the world, from
New York to Paris, from Brazil
to Sri Lanka. It is also possible
to stay at Davidson’ and take
advantage of internships and
other experiential programs to
round out an education.

It does take some time to
research the options available.
Questions such as ‘what do. I
want from my education?’ and
‘can I fulfill my goals by
staying at Davidson?’ need to
be considered.

Wait too long and the options
close by the themselves. Many
of the programs I discovered
last year, I uncovered too late
to apply for. The time, there-
fore, to start thinking about
what to do is now.

To be confronted with a new
situation is a challenge. . . it is
more comfortable to sit back
and put up with the familiar.
However, it is often necessary
to get away from the place and
people you know best in order to
appreciate them more.
