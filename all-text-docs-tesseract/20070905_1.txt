College mourns
influential alumnus

By SUMMERLEE WALTER
Editor-in-Chief

We all recognize the name John
Montgomery Belk. It graces the
doors leading into the arena where
we watch our basketball, volleyball
and wrestling teams compete, and
it belongs to the scholarship that he
endowed. Few of us, though, know
much about the man John Belk °43,
who died on Aug. 17.

During his time at Davidson,
Belk started four years on the var-
sity basketball team and served as a
team captain. He earned the nick-
name “Long John” and helped the
team to its first ever Southern
Conference tournament win
against NC State in 1943. Belk also
took an active role in student gov-
emment and the Panhellenic

Council and was a member of the
Eumenean Literary Society and
Scabbard and Blade.

ws.

The economics degree with
which he graduated served Belk
well when he returned to the fami-
ly business — Belk department
stores, founded by his father
William Henry Belk — in 1952 after
spending three years as a lieutenant
in the U.S. Army Infantry during
World War II and serving as an
officer of the United Nations Civil
Assistance Commission.

As Chairman of the Board, he
grew Belk department stores into
one of the nation’s largest, most
profitable retail outlets.

In addition to chairing a promi-
nent business, Belk served his
community as mayor of Charlotte
for four terms from 1969 until
1977. During his tenure, Belk
expanded the Charlotte/Douglas
International Airport into the hub
for what is now USAirways and
played a key role in bringing pro-

New president Tom Ross addresssed the need for continuing dialogue concerning diversity at this

year’s Opening Convocation.

Opening Convocation tackles
diversity in students and faculty

Monica JAMOUNEAU
News Editor

Last night, speakers at the 2007
Student Convocation unified two
issues that have been increasingly
at the forefront of minds at
Davidson College: how our new
president Tom Ross ’72 will serve
the college, and how the college
will respond to the need for greater
diversity on campus.

Convocation, which took place
in Belk Arena to an audience of
over 500 people, was Ross’ first
Opportunity to speak to the student
body.

When nations get presidents,
they also get first ladies. The same
thing happens at college campuses,
but too often we focus all our atten-
tion on the person in power rather
than the woman that stands next to
him.

In this interview, one
Davidsonian reporter attempts to
find the true Susan Ross, not just as
the wife of our new president Tom
Ross, but also as an important and
influential member of the
Davidson community.

The Davidsonian: If you could
take any course at Davidson, what

Before Convocation, Ross said
that he was eager to speak to the
students.

He had previously given a
speech during freshman orienta-
tion.

“I’ve made hundreds of speech-
es—thousands,” he said, but when
it came time to speak to the new
students, he “felt so much respon-
sibility to do it right.”

At Convocation, Ross displayed
his dexterity at the podium, asking
his students to examine themselves
and their commitment to promot-
ing diversity of ideas and people,

not only at Davidson but in all of
their experiences.

“T’ve lived a career of law, judi-
ciary and philanthropy,” he said of
his non-traditional path to the pres-
ident’s position. “The question I
ask you is can this community we
call Davidson be strong and caring
and even more wonderful than it
is?”

Ross thinks that it can.

Vice President for Student Life
and Dean of Students Tom
Shandley, who introduced Ross,
believes that the new president has
