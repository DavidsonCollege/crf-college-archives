Fraternity Information

President D. Grier Martin
has mailed each member of
the college Board of Trus-
tees a packet of materials
on the fraternity evaluation
question in advance of the
trustees’ annual spring
meeting on campus next
Friday.

The information distributed by
President Martin includes the
Teports of the Fraternity Evalu-
ation Committee (the majority
and two minority reports, the
report of the facuity Committee
on Fraternities, Clubs and Social
‘Life, the faculty action of April
13 and a statement by the IFC.

Martin said that he hopes that
the material will be of benefit
‘to-the Trustees so that they -will
be’ prenared to act effectively
at their meeting Friday.

Tle stated. that since the board
will have to pass upon the large
apprapriation ($100,000) required
‘to éstablsh the two proposed

eating clubs it was necessary to
have all members as well in-
formed as possible.

The trustees‘ Committee on Re-
ligious and Social Life, Church
and Alumni Relationships will
meet Thursday to’ discuss the ac-
tion of the faculty.

The Rev. Albert McClure of
Barium Springs, chairman of the
trustee committee, stated that
it would be meeting for the pur-
pose of study. The agenda of
the committee meeting has yet
‘to be determined, McClure said,
and it was not known to what
extent the committee meeting
would hear information in addi-
tion to that distributed by the
president.

The Education Committee has
been meeting to study the fac-
ulty oath, and the entire board
will act on any recommenda
tions the committee may make.

In. addition, the trustees will,

approve faculty appointments
and leaves of absence and will

it submitted its report to the

Council Debates Stand On Fraternities

By JOE BENTLEY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Student Council spent a con-
siderable amount of time at its
meetingMonday night discussing
the faculty’s report on fraterni-
ties and what action the council
should take concerning it.

Tne meeting opened with Pres-
ident Bill Council reviewing the
role of the faculty report's pro-
posed Social Council. After Da-
vid Walker questioned the need
of having freshmen on the Social
Council and Fred Sackett ex-
plained the need for diversity in
membership, Council announced
that plans for the Social Council
were “highly tentative.” but
stressed that ‘‘we must start
right away."

Council then asked the council
to accept Dan Campbell as chair-
man of the Social Committee,
but this proposal was tabled on
a motion by Walker until the
next meeting.

Billy Clark asked if the coun-

peal this provision,’ Goodstein | cil should take a stand on the

faculty fraternity action. Coun- situation as being “very hairy.”

cil replied that he had ‘‘reser-
vations about the influence of
the council’ in this matter, but
that the council instead should
provide ‘‘the direction for stu-
dent action.”

CIRCULATE PETITION

After Sackett proposed circu-
lating a council-sponsored peti-
tion, Clark expressed his opinion
that most of the trustees are
“outstandingly misinf or me da”
and that this should be tactfully
brought out in any report or pe-
tition sent to the trustees by the
council.

Johnny Gresham briefly chang-
ed the subject, proposing a Stu-
dent Council committee to work
with the IMAC to regulate ath-
letics. No action was taken on
this proposal.

Sackett took the floor again
to present a “brief synopsis of
the problems" caused by the
faculty report, and described the

He declared that the McGav-
ock report was an attempt to
correct a problem without ever
defining it; He labelled the fac-
ulfy report as being ’'a compro
mise b2tween the new and the
older faculty members that sat-
isfied neither.”

FRESHMAN PLEDGING

Sackett, former IFC president,
also said that the IFC is advocat-
ing some sort of freshman pledg
ing and that McGavock would
not head the committee propos-
ing the acceptance of the report.
bearing his name. He conclud-
ed his synopsis with ‘‘the fac-
ulty is not all pleased.”

Lee Fanning expressed the
feeling that the McGavock re-
port is essentially good except
for the five rush weekends
which would serve not only to
tire the fraternities but also the
freshmen. He asked the coun-
cil “to support either the IFC
or the McGavock report with

reservations, preferably the IFC
one’’ due to the smaller num-
ber of rush periods.

Gresham said that one year
of no rush would at least give
the Independents a chance to
set up eating clubs, Sackett con
tinued the eating club theme
with ‘‘the only answer I see for
fraternities to exist is in the
success, of the eating clubs.”

After John Fagg suggested
that whatever report be sent to
the trustees should contain a
request for further and more ex-
tensive study, Julian Prosser
called for a definite stand by
the council on the fraternity sit-
uation.

Council appointed David Mes-
chan chairman of a committee
to submit several proposals to
the council for consideration.

VESPERS ATTENDANCE

Without taking definite action
on the faculty fraternity report
but obviously not in sympathy

with it. the coune!] decided to
support the YMCA‘s report to
the Faculty Religious Life Com:

tending any Christian Sunday

David Powell. asked to be re-

lieved of his job as traffic court:

observer; John Thomas volun-
teered to fill the office.

Jim Timmons then asked why

the driving range is the only
athletic activity which costs, to
which someone jokingly answer-
ed that “it has always been con-
sidered the sport of the wealthy
leisure class.’’ Council directed
Timmons to contact Dr. Tom
Scott about the problem.

After the council decided that
Prosser’s suggestion to consider
action on the drinking rule was
too premature, the second meet-
ing of the new council was ad-
journed. No members were ab-
sent.

up the feelings of the group:
“We've offered our Services as

The Mooresville Tribune saw
fit to disagree with the motives
of the group, however, and sug-
gested in an editorial that Da-
vidson students and faculty were
descending upon Mooresville in
a great crusade to open up polls
to Negroes who had never been
barred from them.

Secor termed the editorial
“most unfortunate,” and com-
mented that the author of the
inflammatory remarks now ‘“‘re-
grets having jumped to a com-
pletely unwarranted conclusion.’

Secor further described the
event as “the most glamorous,
simple response to a completely
uncomplicated request for help
that I have ever seen.”
