Stephen Curry ’10 announced
last Thursday that he will enter the
NBA Draft, foregoing his final sea-
son of eligibility in college.

The decision came after over
a month of deliberation, bringing
closure to the debate surround-
ing arguably the greatest player in
Davidson history. Despite playing
only three seasons, Curry leaves
Davidson as the school’s (and

~ Southern Conference’s) all-time

leading scorer with 2,635 points.
He is also fourth in NCAA history
with 414 career three-pointers.

“Tm at peace with this deci-
sion,” Curry said. “T needed to take
hold of this opportunity while I had
it.”

Draft experts have Curry being
picked anywhere from seventh to
twentieth in the first round of the
draft. As a first round draft pick,
Curry would be entitled to a guar-
anteed multi-million dollar contract
by the current NBA Collective Bar-
gaining Agreement. He is projected
as a point guard in the NBA, the
position he played last season for
the Wildcats after being a shooting
guard for his first two seasons. He
will look to prove that his 6-3, 185
pound frame is not too small for
him to succeed in the NBA.

Curry said that his decision to
leave was complicated by his de-
sire to remain at school and enjoy
the experience at Davidson for one
more year, saying “When I came
here, I thought it was going to be
for four years, with my teammates
and my class. That’s hard for me to
walk away from before I have to.”

Curry led the nation in scoring
with 28.6 points per game last sea-
son on his way to being named a
consensus All-American. He was
also 12th in the nation with 2.6
steals per game, demonstrating the
defensive ability that many experts
will ease his transition to the next

level. He also scored 30 or more
points in a game 30 times.

Curry’s final season ended on
March 23 when the Wildcats were
defeated 80-68 by Saint Mary’s in
the second round of the NIT. The
season saw Curry lead the Southern
Conference in steals and assists (5.6

Trustee receives justice award

CAROLINE Woop

This week, Davidson graduate
and trustee Paul Leonard ’62 was
awarded the Charlotte Coalition for
Social Justice’s annual Humanitar-
ian Award. The 38th awards cer-
emony took place last Tuesday in
Charlotte at the Westin Hotel.

The awards, which are now
annual, were inaugurated in 1957
with the recognition of Judge John
R. Parker, a North Carolina judge
who exercised a long career in
state, federal and international law.

The awards recognize individu-
als working in Mecklenburg Coun-
ty who have “made significant con-
tributions to improving the quality
of life for members of the commu-
nity by challenging discrimination
and/or advocating for equity and
inclusion.”

The coalition honors work in ra-
cial equity, religious expression, di-
versity education and a host of other
fields. The Coalition also maintains

a commitment to supporting youth
activism by reserving one award for
a local young humanitarian, an ac-
tivist who once participated in the
Coalition’s youth education pro-
gram, has served the organization
through their volunteer work and
has continued to branch out, devel-
oping initiatives and efforts of their
own to promote social justice.

Leonard is being honored for
his work in fair housing, where he
has spent decades advocating for
equal opportunity in the struggle to
end homelessness and sub-standard
housing. This year’s awards also
recognized Franklin E. McCain,
a Charlotte civil rights leader, and
Maria Suarez, a local humanitar-
ian.

Recent recipients have included
John Crosland, Jr.., Rabbi Judith
Schindler and Theresa Clark El-
der. Recipients for the award are
nominated by community members
(nominations can. be made in per-
son or through the organization’s
web site) and chosen by the Coali-

tion for Social Justice’s staff.

Leonard graduated from David-
son in 1962 with a degree in history
before completing divinity studies
at the University of Chicago and
a master’s program in business at
Emory University.

He has returned- to Davidson,
where he lives and serves on the
College’s board. Leonard served as
the chair of the presidential search
committee during the nomination
and selection of President Tom
Ross and is also on the Board of
Trustees at Pfeiffer University.

After working as the president
of John Crosland real estate com-
pany and vice president of Centex
Real Estate Corporation, Leonard
worked at Habitat for Humanity In-
ternational for over 15 years, where
he served as treasurer, chair of the
Strategic Planning Committee,
chair of the U.S./Canada Commit-
tee and the U.S. Council and direc-
tor of the Board. In 2005 he was

the Wildcats’ 43-game conference
winning streak. Curry’s notable ef-
forts included 44 points in a loss to
Oklahoma and a win against North
Carolina State, ten straight points
late in a victory over West Virginia
in Madison Square Garden and a
43-point effort against Appalachian
State in the conference tournament
quarterfinals.

Curry’s legacy, however, will
ultimately be his transcendent per-
formance as a sophomore during
the NCAA tournament. Curry pro-
duced 40 points in a first round de-
feat of Gonzaga, scoring 30 in the
second half as the Wildcats rallied
from an 11-point ‘second half hole
and hitting 8-10 three point shots.
He followed this effort with 25 sec-
ond half points against the second-

earlier.this month.

Davidson, Foxx earned his law
degree at New York University

later, he left private practice to
work as a clerk for Nathaniel R.
Jones, a judge on the Sixth Cir-
cuit in Cincinnati, Ohio.

In 1999, Foxx began to work
as Counsel to Congressman Mel-
vin Watt. Foxx has also worked
as a trial attorney with the
Hunton and Williams Law Firm,
where he specialized in business
litigation.

In 2005, Foxx won a seat on
the Charlotte City Council At-
Large as a Democrat. He cur-
rently chairs the Transportation
Committee and is ranking mem-
ber of Charlotte’s Economic De-
velopment Committee. He con-
siders promoting job growth and
