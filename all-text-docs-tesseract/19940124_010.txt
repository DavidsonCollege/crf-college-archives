Still Whistlin' Dixie
More good than bad so country music fans can brag about 1993

By Geoff Graham

For those of you who, when
looking back on 1993, remember
nothing but the bitterness of
“Money in the Bank” or “Haunted
Heart,” I havea list of songs which
I hope will brighten your memo-
ries. Though the past year had
more than its share of embarrass-
ments (Tanya Tucker and Club
Dance on TNN), the Country mu-
sic industry still has a lot to brag
about.

George Strait’s movie, Pure
Country, will most certainly be
nominated for an Oscar in either
the “best musical score” or “best
actor” categories. The Common
Threads album united the Eagles
with Country and helped to save
Walden Woods all in one fell
swoop. The next generation of

artists looks promising with the
appearance of Clay Walker, Faith
Hill, and Doug Supernaw (not to
mention Dude Mowrey and Shawn
Camp, two dudes barely out of
their teens). Clint Black, Alan
Jackson, and George Strait released
strong albums. Steve Wariner be-
gan his comeback. I visited Nash-
ville for the first time. The good
definitely outweighed the bad in
1993.

If this mere sampling of the
positive doesn’t convince you of
the year’s greatness, take a gander
at my list of favorite songs (some
of these might be from 1992, but I
don’t think they really became
popular until last year).

1. Radney Foster, “Easier Said
than Done”

If you haven’t bought his al-

bum Del Rio, Texas 1959, get your
tail to the record store. Rad puts
real heart and soul into his music
and you won’t be disappointed.
2. Clint Black, “State of Mind”

I drove seven hours to see
Clint play and he canceled the
show. If Ican still put this song at
number two, you know it’s got to
be great.

3. George Strait, “I Cross My
Heart”

A fantastic love song from a
fantastic movie with a fantastic
soundtrack.

4. Doug Supernaw, “I Don’t Call
Him Daddy”

This is one of the greatest writ-
ten songs of the year. Doug really
got his foot in the door with this
one.

5. Sawyer Brown, “All these

Old music records have

bels such as Sub-Pop, Matador,
and Caroline. Moreover, Mega-
groups of today such as REM, U2,
Nirvana, and Urge Overkill owe a
tremendous part of their success to
the record industry.

In addition, the clubs and
dance music continue to keep vi-
nyl alive. Ask any MC (although it
might be difficult to do so on this
campus) and he or she will tell you
that for all practical purposes
records mix better and allow a
steadier flow of tempo than CDs or
tapes. Ever wonder how each song
seems to melt neatly into the other?
This phenomenon is the result of
our friend the record.

Quite simply, vinyl, although
technologically outdated, is an es-
sential part of our musical heritage
that is all too quickly being forgot-
ten or overlooked, Many influen-
tial artists would never been able
to withstand the colossal price of
production had it not been for this
method of recording sound. The
same holds true for musicians to-
day. Furthermore, in my opinion
vinyl more effectively reveals the
true art behind music. They obvi-
ously don’t sound as good as the
CD. However, in their warbled
imperfection, they do allow for a
greater degree of reflection and
thought as to what the truer, purer
definition of sound might be. Lis-
tening to Jimi Hendrix on viny] is

new charm

truly an illuminating experience. I
can picture myself in Monterey in
1967 listening to his infectious
music.

Finally, although CD casesare
handy and have qualities of dis-
play, they don’t compare to the
jacket of a record. Album covers
to records are meant to be seen and
handled with delicate care. They’re
art themselves as they more effec-
tively convey the feelings of the
artist than a small CD picture.

There’s no denying that CDs
are great. However, the record is
not just an invention to be written
off by better developments in the
audio production. It can still hold
its own. Many people are quickly
Starting to realize this fact.

Years”
I can’t snderdsanid why these
boys aren’t more popular when

_ they consistently release powerful

songs like this, “Cafe on the Cor-
ner,” and “The Dirt Road.”

6. Patty Loveless, “Nothin’ but the
Wheel”

This song really moved me. I
felt it deserved a lot more air time
than it received, but in a way I’m
glad. Constant overplaying spoiled
too many songs for me in 1993.
7. Steve Wariner, “If I Didn’t
Love You”

Steve solidified his comeback
with this piece in addition to his
song “Drivin’ and Cryin’.” It’s
good to have this veteran back in
the stream of things.

8. Alan Jackson, “Chattahoochee”

I know what your thinking.
So far the list has included serious,
or at least somewhat deep, songs.

’ Well, “Chattahoochee” may be a

little light hearted, but it does have
a deeper meaning: don’t forget
where you came from and the les-
sons you took with you. I came
from the small town of Atlanta,

nestled on the quiet banks of the
lazy Chattahoochee, and I’ve
dipped in its waters more than once.
Sentimentality demands I include
it on my list.

9. George Strait, “Easy Come,
Easy Go”

George Strait is great, there’s
just no denying it. And he can act,
too. Really.

10. Martina McBride, “The Way
that I Am” :

I love this song, but in all
seriousness, have you ever seen
Martina McBride? She’s singing
“my baby loves me just the way
that Iam,” but she just might be the
most beautiful woman I’ve ever
seen. If I were her baby I’d love
her just the way that she is, too.
Martina will be mine. Oh yes, she
will be mine.

Well, there it is. Geoff
Graham’s favorite Country tunes
of 1993. Ifanyone forgot to get me
a Christmas present, I’d love a tape
of all these songs. I hope your
holidays went well and you all got
a brand new cowboy boots. Take
care and have a happy new year.
