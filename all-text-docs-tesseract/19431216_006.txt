The K. S.’s and, Betas remained
close on the heels of the pace-set-

improvement recently and promise
to give the leaders a run for their

while Alphin has become the key
man in the Beta attack,

The Pikaps and Pikas currently
occupy the cellar berths with no
prospect of bettering themselves.
Bennett and Floyd have been by
far the outstanding men on the Pi

have played consistent ball for the
Pikas.

The Catawba Indians invaded the
Wildcat lair and were soundly shel-

cagers. The locals used the entire
squad to subdue the blue and white
forces from Salisbury 49-25. Mike
Williams again led the scoring with
12 points. Big Jim Lowry was run-
ner-up with 10. Haller, of Catawba,
repeatedly brought the crowd to
its feet with beautiful hook: shots

Ed.: “Naw, Ferret, there are too
many points to it. Besides we need
an article with oomph to it, like
the ‘Spider.’ ”

S. Ed.: “Hey, how does ‘David-
son shellacked Charlotte Y’ sound?”
Ed.: ‘Naw, Jake, use trounced
instead of shellacked. You see shel-
lack might have alcohol in it and we
can’t take chances.”

Snoop (Suddenly alive); “What if
I do a sequel to the ‘Spider?’ You
know, sorta serial-like: Whew, I

Ed.: “No, that’s been done.” *

S. Ed.: “Say, Ed., looks like I will

different and that’s all anyone reads
anyway.”

The Cast: “Merry Christmas.”
