A tale more grotesque than Grimm:
The Universal Wolf takes a new twist on an old story

By EmiLy SIMMONS
Staff writer

This week at Davidson the-
ater goers saw Little Red Riding
Hood with an interesting twist.
Written by Joan Schenkar and di-
rected by Davidson Theater pro-
fessor Joe Gardner, The Universal
Wolf was a “vicious new version”
of the childhood favorite. The play
was produced in the Black Box
Theatre giving it an intimate feel
and which lent itself to the cast/
audience interaction.

The plot of The Universal Wolf
centers around a slightly altered
version of the Little Red Riding
Hood tale. Rather than centering
on the plight of the poor, helpless
little girl, this version focused more
on Grandmother and on the desires
of the wolf — desires which prove
to be no more evil than anybody
else’s especially
Grandmother’s. In a discussion
session with Joan Schenkar after
the play, Ms. Schenkar highlighted

this aspect of Grandmother’ s per-
sonality in discussing the central
theme of the play: that there is a
wolf in everyone and that he is
capable of thinking or doing bad
things.

Schenkar also added that she
is trying to deal with larger-than-
life emotions in this play, emo-
tions that really could not be
brought forth in real life. She takes
some of these emotions such as
wanting to murder your grand-
daughter and puts them in a hu-
morous light, thus creating an ex-
plosive effect that allows the viewer
to experience these feelings
through the characters in the play.

Little Red, played by Heather
Baldwin, instead of being the in-
nocent and naive youth of fairy
tale lore was an annoying and ob-
noxious girl who did not do much

to win the hearts of the viewers as ©

she pranced around the stage whin-
ing and complaining.

Although warned about the
wolf by her mother, Little Red still

does not recognize him when she
meets him. Even though she looks
up to her Grandmother, Little Red
annoys her Grandmother so much
that her grandmother ends up kill-
ing her at the end of the play. So
much for the sweet little girl who
hoped to seek protection with her
grandmother.

Little Red’s nemesis, M.
Woolf, played by Derek Judson, is
aFrench structuralist gentleman in
a tuxedo who believes his refined,
French version of the fairy tale is
much more refined than the
Grimm’s version. He also believes
he can trick Little Red and her
grandmother into “making” a tasty
dinner. Little Red and her grand-
mother aren’t as stupid as the
Grimm brothers would have us
think. .
After arriving at Grand-
mother’s house in a Little Red dis-
guise, M. Woolf is tricked into the
armoir where Little Red is hiding.
After a loud scuffle Little Red kills
M. Woolf with an axe. M. Woolf he

from page 10

“Love’s Recovery”: “How I wish
I were atrinity, so that if Ilosta part
of me / Id still have two of the
same to live / But nobody gets a
lifetime rehearsal, as specks of dust,
we’re universal.”

NOMADS INDIANS SAINTS.

, Coming: only 18 months after /n-
digo Girls, Nomads seems more
rushed than its predecessor. Still,
the songs beat any other folk music
from the ‘time, even Tracy
Chapman. Like R.E.M., Emily
and Amy brought political and so-
cial issues into the usual philo-
sophical mix. They are so rarely
trite, but I must admit lines like
“My life is part of the global life”
sometimes make me cringe. They
go for even fuller arrangements
than the previous release, breaking
away from the traditional acoustic
guitar-based world of suburban
folk. Nomads marks a small step
back, but an understandable one in
the post-/ndigo Girls era.

BACK ON THE BUS, YA’LL.
This 1991 album resembles U2’s
Under a Blood Red Sky, compiling
a half hour of favorite live perfor-
mances to take a rest after three
good studio albums. Despite Roll-
ing Stone’s assertion to the exact
opposite, this does not have their

best performances, and it doesn’t .

satisfy quite like the studioalbums.
It’s not supposed to. It still makes
for a great listen and shows that
they really can sing those amazing
harmonies. And speaking of U2:
their live version of “All Along the
Watchtower” blows the Rattle and
Hum one out of the water.

RITES OF PASSAGE. 1 can
still remember driving back from
Georgia with my girlfriend in the
summer of 1992, listening to this

album for the first time. In retro-
spect, it was the perfect way to
listen to this, their most relaxed
and upbeat album; at the time,
though, I did not like it. Two
months later, I couldn’t stop listen-

_ing to it. Starting with the deep

tribal beat of “Three Hits,” Rites
takes chances at every turn and
comes outahead almostevery time.
Though the lyrics continue to im-
press, this is their strongest musi-
cal album. With that in mind, I
don’t blame some fans for calling
this, not /ndigo Girls, their best.
SWAMP OPHELIA. Their
most recent release came out this
summer, almost two years after
Rites of Passage. Like Rites,
Swamp Ophelia did not do much
for me at first. Unfortunately, I
never fell in love with this one. As

with the others, there are many
great moments. Amy breaks the,
bounds of folk rock with the hard-
edged, six-minute epic “Touch Me
Fall.”” Emily gives cameos of her
tongue-in-cheek depth, asin “Mys-
tery.” But there are some unprec-
edented duds among the 11 songs.
Emily’s cheesy “Power of Two” is
at best a guilty pleasure and at
worst a sickening piece of senti-
mentality. Despite good lyrics,
Amy’s “Dead Man’s Hill” and
“This Train Revised” simply an-
noy the ear. Though hate to admit
it, Swamp Ophelia is Rites of
Passage’ s tired cousin: less addic-
tive, less creative, and less inspir-
ing. A beginning Indigo Girls lis-
tener, as well as the casual fan,
would do better going to the lush
well of their back catalog.

doesn’t even stand a chance against
Grandmother and Little Red.

Grandmother, played by Jen-
nifer Neale, proves to be the high-
light of this play. She becomes the
opposite of what everyone thinks
of as “Grandmother.” She guzzles
blackberry wine like an alcoholic,
and she is not stupid enough to fall
for M. Woolf’s disguise.

Who would have ever thought
that Grandmother could outwit the
wolf, and better yet, who would
have ever thought Grandmother
could outwit the wolf while
schnockered? Grandmother busts
the barriers of the traditional fairy
tale and creates a likable, yet to-
tally nontraditional, character.

The entire play is set around a
reader, performed. by Adrienne
Nixon, who talks about various
slides put up throughout the play.

The slides are of philosophers
whose thoughts relate only ob-
scurely to the action of the play.
Although overly pretentious, these

sidelights actually add to the play
by adding to the confusion of emo-
tion that is created. What exactly
are we supposed to think of these
characters and what is the reader
talking about?

Both the set design by Miles
Mowry and the costume design by
Kathryn Schlee were beautiful and
essential to the theme of the play.
The set was wonderfully crooked
and colorful.

It added to the highly styl-
ized, larger-than-life effect that the
play was trying to achieve. In
addition to all the other costume’ s,
Little Red’s short costume with

‘cleavage added to her entire im-

age.

The Universal Wolf, although
quite enigmatic, allows the viewer
to see the fairy tale from the view-
points of all the characters and
helps the viewer to realize that
perhaps a poor, helpless little girl
and old grandmother aren’t always
what they first appear to be.
