__THE DAVIDSONIAN

Frontcourt Players’
Skill on Exhibit

With dominant rebounding and
potent shooting, the men’s basketball
team finished their exhibition season in
convincing fashion defeating the Char-
lotte Royals 91-58.

Multiple runs by Davidson defined
game play from the opening tip-off to
the end of regulation. The Wildcats
took advantage of the Royals’ slow
start jumping out to a early 16-3 lead on
baskets by all five starters.

Coach Bob McKillop’s team never
looked back, consistently maintaining
a double digit lead. Shutting down the
Royal offense in the second half,
Davidson looked unstoppable as they
went on a demoralizing 32-6 run.

The ‘Cats shot over 51 percent for
the game, highlighted by the interior
play of Stephen Marshall and Chadd
Holmes. Marshall shot a near perfect 7-
8 from the floor including two from
behind the three-point arc to end with
16 points.

Holmes pitched in 13 points with
strong ball-fakes leading to easy lay-
ups underneath, Holmes was not afraid
to take it outside either, hitting on his
lone shot from twenty feet.

Senior guard Ali Ton noticed
Holmes intensity. “He shot the ball well
and showed a lot of poise.”

This year’s team again proved
competent at sinking the long range
bombs. Six ‘Cats players connected
from beyond the arc. The outside game
prevented the Royals from double-team-
ing the ball in the post.

“It’s difficult to cheat on the ball
when six guys are making three point-
ers,” McKillop said.

But the Wildcats did more than

shoot the ball effectively.

Led by Emeka Erege’s 10 re-
bounds, Davidson pulled down 57
boards to the Royals’ paltry 23. In fact
the Wildcats grabbed more offensive
boards than the Royals could accumu-
late on both ends of the floor combined.

“We are real pleased with the re-
bounding effort,” McKillop. said.
“Emeka had 10 rebounds in 23 minutes.
That’s impressive.”

The 6-4 Erege, although smaller
than the typical forward, showed his

PORTS
Men’s basketball successful again in p

ability to get the loose ball in the paint.
He appeared more confident crashing
the glass underneath, effectively tip-
ping the ball out to the guards for sec-
ond chance points. .

Erege, who suffered a traumatic
leg fracture last year, his impressing his
team-mates with a strong post-surgery
recovery.

“He’s aggressive and he’s getting
there,” said captain Ton. ‘With more
time, he will definitely be back to where
he should be.”

Unlike the game against VASDA,
Davidson could not finda handle for the
ball and committed a shaky 21 turn-
overs.

Heading into the Duke game,
McKillop knows how important ball
control is to an effective offense. “We
have to cut down on the turnovers. We
can’t have so many.”

Yet the turnovers seem to be the
only blemish from Thursday night’s
game as Davidson’s defense suffocated
the Royals offensive efforts, forcing
quick, impatient shots. The Wildcats
held Charlotte to 35 percent shooting
for the game.

Charles Wittman led the Royals
with 17 points on 7-21 shooting.

Landis gets it done

By MIKE ANDERSON
Sports Editor

Head football coach Tim Landis
has never been one to shy away from
tough decisions. But then again, who
could blame him? His always seem to
pay off. ;

In 1989, while head football coach
at Morrisville High School in
Morrisville, Pennsylvania, Landis chose
to cross a picket-line of striking teach-
ers in order to field the school’s football
team. Ostracized by his striking peers,
Landis endured the silent treatment from
the teachers at the school. But he deliv-
ered a remarkable 8-2 record with a
diminished roster of only 26 men.

In 1991, he left his position as
director of athletics, head football coach
and head baseball coach at Morrisville
High. For what? A job as a restricted-
earning coach earning “chicken feed”
at a Division III football school that had
won but 21% of its games over the
previous decade. Only two years later,
at the tender age of 28, Landis assumed
the helm of that Davidson College foot-
ball program.

Five years into his tenure, Landis
was faced with another tough decision.
He had built a solid foundation for a
winning football program at Davidson,
but greatness seemed to be just beyond
reach. So the summer before 1998,
Landis and his staff injected new life
into the squad by installing a new of-
fense and mixing up some personnel,
especially on the defensive side of the
ball. :

A record-setting season is testa-
ment: Landis’s tough call paid off.
Again.

On the field.

Landis has shown an affinity for
athletic competition since his youngest
days. His father explains, “He started
playing youth football when he was six.
It was interesting because the only
league in our town was run by the Catho-
lic Church, and you had to be amember
of the Catholic Church to participate
and we were Protestants. But Tim used
to go to their practices every day, and
the coaches got special dispensation
from the Catholic Church for him to
play. He was only six years old, but they
liked what they saw.”

Young Tim continued to partici-
pate in competitive athletics through
the college level, where he starred as a

* where, and (more impor-

quarterback and pitcher at Randolph-
Macon College in Ashland, Virginia.
His passion for athletics would carry
him far beyond his college days. “I
always knew he would end up in coach-
ing,” reflects the elder Landis. “He was
born to be a coach. He was a tremen-
dous competitor and he loved athlet-
ics.”

Tim’s father attributes much of his
son’s success as a football coach here at
Davidson to his experience as a scholar-
athlete at Randolph-Macon, “There’s
no doubt about the fact that his past
gives him the ability to relate to these
players.”

Sophomore quarterback Shaun
Tyrance says, “Coach Landis is a well-
respected guy, especially because he
played quarterback himself so success-
fully. All of us look to him for leader-
ship and guidance.”

Young gun.

Landis was hired at
Davidsonin 1991 by Coach
Dave Fagg. Fagg, who
coached at Davidson from
1970-1973, returned for a
short stintin the early 1990s
to help revive a football
program that had gone 4-
47 over the past five years.
Fagg guided Davidson toa
14-13 record before hand-
ing over the reins to the
young Landis. “He was
only 28 years old,” explains
the coach’s proud father.
“He was certainly one of
the youngest head coaches
in the country. Now he’s in
his sixth season, and he’s
had three winning seasons
out of six. You have to look
at his staff, too. He’s got a
great staff of guys. Al Lo-
gan came in this year as
offensive coordinator.
Morris Starr came in and
has done a great job as de-
fensive secondary coach
under Tripp Merritt.

A coach that cares.

It is often said that a
good leader possesses two
qualities: heis going some-

tantly) he is able to con-
vince. others to go along
with him, Unquestionably,

Landis is taking this football program
to new heights. But he is not doing it
alone. Senior captain Tom Ting speaks
for the team when he. says, “We have
unlimited faith in our coaches.”

Wildcat quarterback Tom Dugan
also praises Landis’s sensitivity to the
needs of his athletes, “He’s not all about
getting whatever he can out of his play-
ers, at any cost — he remembers that
we’re supposed to be enjoying this ex-
perience. I don’t think all coaches are
like that. In terms of just caring about
his players, that’s what he’s really good
at.”

Fans of Wildcat football quickly
learn not to confuse Landis’s sensitiv-
ity with timidity. The fiery coach has a
reputation for inspiring and motivating
his men. “One thing that’s always been
remarkable to me is his leadership abil-
ity,” conveys Dugan. “He’s probably

basketball. The sophomore had 10 rebounds in 23
minutes against Charlotte Thursday.

one of the best motivators when speak-
ing before a game or at half-time. His
leadership ability is pretty unique, he’s
so good at it. He’s good at making us
believe in what we’re doing. If there’s
one thing for sure, .we know that he
believes in what he’s doing. Even when
we had bad years, we knew that he
believed that we could win. That has

finally trickled down this year, and got
our team believing that we can win.”

A signon Tim Landis’s door reads:
“Accept the challenges, so that you may
feel the exhilaration of victory.” It was
no doubt a challenge to rebuild what
was once a pitiful football program. But
in 1998, Landis experienced the exhila-
ration of victory. Eight times.
