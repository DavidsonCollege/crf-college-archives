THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS. MONDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1993 9

Bobby Ramsay
Consider business before

granting gays civil rights.

In last week’s issue of The
Davidsonian, Anna R. Kirkland
advocated the passage of a Civil
Rights Act to protect sexual orien-
tation in her article “Grant gays
legal right to protect equality &
justice.”

It is true that, as citizens, ho-
mosexuals should be granted the
same rights as the rest of us; but an
Act such as the one Kirkland ex-
tols may actually tread on the rights
of many others.

Kirkland used the example of
the openly lesbian mother in Vir-
ginia whose child was taken from
her because she was gay. It was
not noted, however, that this
woman admittedly engaged in oral
sex, which, strange as itmay seem,
is a felony in Virginia. It was this
admission that was the strongest
influence on the judge’s decision
that the mother would be a poor
moral example for the child. Al-
most always, the children of felons
are taken from them, despite the
specific crime.

Another example used wasthe
firing of several employees from
the Cracker Barrel restaurant be-
cause of their sexual orientation.
A Civil Rights Act such as the one
Kirkland promotes would preclude
this kind of action.

The Cracker Barrel, though,
is a private business, and if it is
losing customers because of the
presence of a certain individual,
then it has a right to get rid of that
individual for no other reason than
the survival of the business.

As an example, we will look
at Joe’s Deli. Joe’s caters to a
specific clientele. Many of the
customers have been patrons for
decades. One day, the meat slicer
quits and Joe runs an add in the
newspaper. Soon, Joe hires Al, the
new guy in town who has a great
deal of meat slicing experience.
Business continues to flourish, and
the loyal customers of Joe’s Deli
seem to be very happy with their
sliced meat.

And then, somehow, it is dis-

covered that Al is HIV-positive.
Rumors spread, and soon Joe no-
tices that some of the regular cus-
tomers haven’t been to the Deli in
along time. Soon, business drops
so low that Joe barely makes a
profit one month.

One day, Joe is at the grocery
store and overhears a few women
talking about his deli. They say
they would never gotoa deli where
some guy with AIDS is cutting the
meat. Now Joe knows why busi-
ness has declined. He has nochoice
but to fire Al.

Businesses must have busi-
ness to make it, and anything that
stands in the way of optimum busi-
ness and profit must be eliminated.

Now, I don’t know if the
Cracker Barrel was losing busi-
ness because of the gay employ-

ees. However, if it was, and the
Civil Rights Act presented by
Kirkland existed, there would be
nothing that Cracker Barrel could
do about it. This stands in the way
of capitalism, and gives inargu-
able rights to one group while pro-
hibiting the success of another.
The situation is similar for
doctors. A recent article in The
Charlotte Observer entitled “Den-
tists sued for dropping AIDS pa-
tients” spoke of a dental center in
Houston that was sued by the Jus-
tice Department for refusing to treat
an HIV-positive individual, which
violated the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act. After eight months of
treatment, the patient was told ina
letter: “Due to the recent discov-
ery of your health problems, [our
dental center] has decided to cease

I am even neurotic

in the laundry.

1 do my own laundry here at
Davidson. No, I’m not going to
complain about the laundry ser-
vice. I agree 100% with Wesley
Davis (wasn’t his letter sweet?).
The reason that I do my own laun-
dry is that I’m such a pathetic
mama’s boy; I must have my
clothes fluffy soft and April fresh.
I think that I am the only person on
this campus who is obsessed with
using fabric softener. My clothes
are the one part of me that smells
good.
You can tell a lot about a per-

son by observing them wash their
clothes. You can spot the anal
retentive, the slobs, and the hope-
less. [getasort of sadistic pleasure
watching people come in who have
absolutely no idea how to work a
laundry machine. One time (I
swearthis is nota joke) I was doing
laundry, and a guy came in who
didn’t know that he needed soap to
wash his clothes.

’ What I found out about my-
self is that I’m a moron. I went to
the senior apartment laundry and
was incredibly disappointed that
there were coin slots in the wash-

" ersand dryers. I cursed the school
for being cheap, ran back to my
apartment for quarters, and spent
about three bucks before someone
told me that the machines work
just fine without money.

One of the biggest problems
in the laundry occurs when
somebody’s wash is done, but
they’re not there to claim it. I
never know exactly how to handle
the situation. I look in the machine
to see if the owner is male or fe-
male. If the clothes belong to a
male, no problem. They’re out of

the machine and on the table like a

‘hot tamale: But if ldok in the drier

and Iseea bunch of delicate ladies’
underthings, Islam that door faster
than I would on that encyclopedia
guy on TV. (Ihad some difficulty
creating appropriate similes in this
paragraph. Don’t question them.)

“You sexist pig. You little
brown noser. Are you afraid that
some gitl might think you’re a
jerk?” Nay, nay, little bear. Plenty

of girls the world over think that

I’m a poor excuse for a human
being already. Being called a jerk
is nothing new; it happens every
day. The reason I don’t touch
girls’ laundry is that I know that
this will happen: I'll get the tow-
els, t-shirts, and all the sterile stuff
out just fine. But 1 know that at the
precise moment when both my
hands are filled with dainty things
from Victoria’s Secret (or worse
—Frederick’s of Hollywood), the
owner of these particular panties
(God, I hate that word) will come
strolling through the door. I'll
freeze, blush, andlook very guilty.
The young lady will scream, punch
me, and run into the night, yelling
“Nathan Seay is a pervert” at the
top of her lungs.

Some people are very polite
and fold the laundry they take out
of the driers. Idon’t want to gointo
why I would never fold any girl’s
laundry. Anybody remember Vi-
sion Quest? Let’sjust say that I’ve
had several nightmares about get-
ting busted as badas the guy in that
movie.

So if you’re a guy and you
find your laundry onatable, you’re
more than welcome to blame me.
If you’re female, don’t blame me
for missing underwear. There’s
plenty of that laying all over the
laundry floor. I could have a bag

 full'of it any time.Iwant. »°:

First of all, AIDS patients
should notbe included in the group
protected by the Americans with
Disabilities Act. They have an
infectious, incurable disease, not
paralysis or a missing limb. Yes,
they do deserve protection against
discrimination, but not under the
Disabilities Act.
Secondly, a doctor of any kind
has a responsibility to protect his
patients from possible health
threats such as the HIV virus. If
that dentist in Houston feels that
the AIDS victim poses a real and
unnecessary threat to his other pa-
tients, he should have the ability to
discontinue service to that person.
Concerns of American busi-
nesses cannot be overlooked.

Women speak a
different language.

I was hanging upside down in
the jungle gym with my best friend
Danny discussing the prosandcons
of having Grover for president
when all of a sudden Heather
walked by and shot a loogie at me.
Immediately I knew that Heather
Green, the class cubby monitor,
the tall brown haired girl with freck-
les, and the cutest girl with no front
teeth, was going to be the mother
of my twelve children. So I did
what most five year old guys do
when they’re in love: I yanked her
pigtails.

Life used tobe sosimple. Only
yesterday, the woman of your
dreams was that little girl who
tagged you during duck duck
goose. Or you could find out if a
girl liked you by using one of these
clever questionnaires:

Heather, do you like me?
(Please check which applies)

___ Yea.

____ Nope.

____ Sort of.

____ Who are you?

Asmen and women get older,
they start playing subversive mind
games because they’re of
showing their true feelings. They
emit mixed signals, hand signals,
no signals and morse code signals.

_Thonestly don’t think that men and

women speak the same language. I
actually overheard the following
conversation at the Duke soccer
game the other night:

KATE: What did he say about
what she told him about that inci-
dent he had?

JENNY: Well, he said that
she wanted him to tell her that he
said he wanted him to her him that
he how. °

KATE: Really ?/!!

Perhaps women use this in-
trinsic code that men must some-
how try to interpret and under-
stand. I know that the guy that
wrote the book How to Under-
stand Women and Fix a Standard
Butterfly Valve Carburetor is
bloody rich.

Apparently women have the
same problem understanding men.
A recent issue of YM had the fol-
lowing headline: “100 Guys give
inside dirt on dating, relationships
and why they love the Mets.” Yes,
the language of the male includes
philosophy, religion, literature, the
sciences and mathematics which
are all neatly packaged in the latest
Baseball Weekly (This week’s is-
sue includes of an aesthetic picto-
rial of John Kruk using the
thighmaster). Men arejust suckers

ON Pete ae peer

And women are picking upon
this:

EMILY: Um, so you’re in
Biology right?

BOB: Nope.

EMILY: Have you gone tothe
new Visual Arts Center yet?

BOB: (Whistling dixie) Uh,
no.

EMILY: Did you know that
the Phillies won?

BOB: The PHILLIES
WON?!! Really? Wow! They’re
incredible! Gosh, that means
they’ve clinched!!' YAHOO!!!
Emily, will you marry me?!!

Clearly, women have the clear
advantage over men. They’ve
learned that the way to a man’s
heart is through good old baseball.
Men however have a distorted un-
derstanding of what women want
that usually ends up being com-
pletely wrong.

So, to any guys out there, if
you’ve got an incredible under-

_standing of women, come share

your knowledge with me and I'll
take good notes. We’ll be bloody
rich.
