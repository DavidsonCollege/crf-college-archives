a small

Plans were discussed for a Sen-
ior-Faculty “field day” sometime
this spring at a smoker given by
the Senior class Monday night.

Ovid Bell, chairman of the Sen-
ior-Faculty relations committee,
outlined tentative plans for the af-
fair. Athletic events including golf
and tennis matches, a softball game,
and horseshoes and bowling con-
tests will be held in the afternoon.
Later a barbecue will be held on
the golf course, after which the
group will gather around a_ bon-
fire for night entertainment.

After Bell had given his report,
the smoker was declared informal
by Sam Newell, president of the
class. During this time members of
the faculty and seniors discussed
the possibilities of such an affair a-
mong themselves.

Later the meeting was called to
order again for a short time, and
several other suggestions were
made by members of the group.

Six members of the faculty, Pro-
fessor Johnston, Professor McGa-
vock, Mr. Jackson, Professor Flea-
gle, Major Steel, and Mr. Whittle,
consented to work with the stu-
dent committee to iron out details.
The student committee consists of
Bell as chairman and Shaw Smith
