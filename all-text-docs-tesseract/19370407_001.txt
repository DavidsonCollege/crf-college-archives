Hill and Mauze Complete
Debates On Western Trip

Haywood Hill and Charles Mauze
completed the western debating
trip in which they represented
Davidson College at three Southern
colleges on March 20th.

On this trip they met the Uni-
versity of the South, Centre Col-
lege and the University of Ken-
tucky. All of them were non-de-
cision debates, and in each case
Davidson upheld the affirmative of
the question, “Resolved, that Con-
gress should have the right to fix
minimum wages, and maximum
hours for industry.”

The debaters left Davidson on
the afternoon of March 10th, going
to Asheville, N. C., for the night.
Then they continued by way of
Knoxville and Chattanooga to Se-
wanee, Tenn., where they met the
University of the South. They met
Centre College on Monday, March

15th, in Danville, Ky., and then pro-

ceeded to Lexington for the final
debate with the University of Ken-
tucky, held on March 17th,
Although their opponents were
all from brother colleges of Ten-
nessee or Kentucky, the audiences
varied somewhat in each case. At
the University of the South it was
composed principally of interested
students of the college. But at
Centre College they debated before
the Women’s Division, and at the
University of Kentucky it was be-
fore a high school audience mainly.
Charlie Mauze is a member of
the senior class, treasurer of the
Forensic Council, manager of
freshman debating, and a member
of “Alpha Phi Epsilon, honorary
forensic fraternity. Haywood Hill
