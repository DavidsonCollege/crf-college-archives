By JOHN MUNCE_.

Davidson is tension; surging
and changing as the clash of
many forces, cushioned by a
conservative tradition. David-
son, men’s essences, defy
analysis, mock the intellectual
dissection they foment.

Yet, one must make the ef-
fort to analyze and change the
order. One must play
Sisyphus, knowing that little
can be done, that much is
being done.

Unlike Sisyphus, we must
shove nothing so simple as a
boulder. We face an intricate
and cumbersome machine,
applying pressure in selected
spots--but not too much in one
place. And this is the easy

part.

What forms the heaviest
portion of our boulder is
something we cannot grip. It
is the ‘‘attitude’’ of Davidson.

This is the same kind of en-
tity as “society” and ‘“‘the
establishment.’’ It exists,
everyone knows that, yet it is
intangible.

It is the unspoken sum of all
the components of the com-
munity. It is more than the
sum, and different from both
components and sum. Each of
us contributes to it, but each
would deny congruency with
it.

This is the entity, the per-
vasive force which must be
changed to effect true growth.
It is also what is most

ideal and efforts.

Where should we head with
this change? Toward a fully
human environment. Grade
pressure must be fought by
all. It must never be allowed
to be the overriding concern in
a learning situation. Anxiety
over ‘“‘producing”’ should not
be so gleefully fostered.

Yes, there is great
academic pressure at David-
son. We all know this and
should work to make it less
painful, to make the en-
vironment as emotionally
balanced as possible.

We must be constantly on
guard, as a group and as in-
dividuals, against the destruc-
tive tensions rampant in a
pressure-filled | academic
tower.

People must grow as people,

encouraged by the spoken and
the unspoken.
The unspoken, the attitude
now abroad, often contradicts
the expression of individuals,
saying, ‘Yes, grow, but in
these several restricted chan-
nels. Good grades are the
mark of a worthwhile person.
They are the salaries of this
community. Keep up with the
Joneses.

“If you have problems, we'll
be glad to help you-as long as
you don’t lose your grip on the
fully-controlled Davidson man
(women must also fit in).
Emotions, sensitivity, spon-
taneous understanding all
have their place, just don’t let
them out in the open too much.

‘Davidson people study hard;
they are busy (and therefore,

tests and food.

The third mountain Crafts Week could hardly be called com-
plete without some mention of food. Unlike the coastal regions,
however. there is little in the line of true ‘‘mountainfood”’.

Another oddity 1 have noticed is that people who actually live in
the mountains (Florida summertimers excluded) frequent
chain hamburger and pizza joints when they eat out. Ordinarily,
this would indicate that the local food is really bad.

Such is not the case in this instance, however. The most ob-
viously mountain restaurants serve their customers family
style. For the customary price of $3.50, the diner receives
chicken, country ham, all kinds of vegetables, and homemade
biscuits - all with unlimited refills. To do such a meal justice
requires an extensive preliminary fast coupled with arduous
physical exertion, and a large bag to carry off the leftovers.

The locals know their limitations and save such a meal for ex-
treme circumstances. The average Davidsonian, after spending
a day engrossed in the mountains, could get quite a recharge
from eating in such a restaurant.

At the foot of Mount Jefferson State Park lies a combination
campground, livery, amusement park, and restaurant called
Greenfield. The restaurant is in an attractive old farm house,
and people come from throughout the nation to eat there.

In addition to the a la carte menu, they have the family style
deal. Regardless of the selection, the food is the best I have
found in western Carolina, and is also very reasonably priced.

Moving further south, we come to Burnsville. Burnsville is
known for three things: as the only town in N.C. with a village
green, for its illustrious sherriff, and as the home of the Nu Wray

n.

This Inn is probably the most famous family style place in all
the Appalachians, but recent commercialization has caused a
deterioration in the quality of the food. Ever since I got to know
the Sherriff in a hostile sort of way, I have not eaten there, nor
have I been in the town.

One of the most popular stopping places on the Parkway is

Laundry Termination Leaves

30 Workers All Washed Up

To the Editor:

The purpose of this letter is
to respond to an article in the
March 22 issue regarding the
laundry. I feel that additional
information is needed to shed
light on the problem of the
laundry.

The college, prior to the ar-
ticle, was in the midst of a
study concerning the ultimate
end of the laundry. Mr Currie
and Mrs. Beaver, business
manager of the college, and
head of the laundry respec-
tively, are in charge of the
study. So one can see that the
college is concerned and
aware of the problem.

But perhaps the most im-
portant consideration

everyone seems to have
neglected is the plight of the 30
men and women who work
there. Of the 30 people now
employed only a few have less
than 30 years of service.

Some have as much as 35
years. In the next three years,
between five and ter of the
employees will be eligible for
retirement benefits.

The college, not just the ad-
ministration, but the students
also, has a responsibility to
these people and their
families. If the college laun-
dry were closed now, the
people eligible would lose
retirement benefits and be for-
ced to look for new jobs at a
at when the job market is
ight. >

colors leaps out, not only from the plates (if indeed the wan-

One way in which the laun-
dry is trying to remedy the
situation at the present is to
reduce services as people
retire. Instead of rehiring as
people leave, services are cut.

One proposed end of the
laundry would cut its services
to only shirts and linens. By
1977, this would be possible as
the work force would be
reduced, and the surplus
workers could possibly be
spread out to different jobs
within the college.

If there is a move for the
college laundry to be closed by
a sufficient number of studen-
ts, I would abide by that
decision. But the decision
should not be made hastily.

A solution which would be
beneficial to all those con-
cerned is being sought after
now but will take time.
