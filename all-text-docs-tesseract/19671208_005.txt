Davidson And Defense

Defense is Driesell. Various writers in the Caro-
linas and the East continually write about the tough
defense Lefty always talks about and seldom says he
has seen at Davidson lately. He was probably correct
when he told the writers that defense was absent in
the Bucknell and VMI games. Still, after a hard prac-
tice on Monday which stressed defense, 'we contained
Furman, to say the least, even if there was not much

to contain.

For years Lefty has been preaching that defense
is the key to success in modern college basketball. His
theory is based on the belief that defense will com-
pensate for a poor offensive exhibjtjon, Of course
when both the defense and the offense is Tacking, we
lose. This happened several times last year.

Lefty’s brand of defense is stressed to such a de-
gree that it was almost three weeks after the opening
day of practice before we shot the basketball in an
offensive situation. We ran through many ingenious
drills designed to develop the “hardnosed” defense
Lefty demands. We hit the floor, opponents, and each
other with the dedication that only Cop Linker knows
in giving parking tickets. These drills are not especial-
ly meant for a game in which the players wear little
more than their underwear, but they are supposed to

help win basketball games.

“Davidson, defense, desire,” is supposed to be our
slogan. I remember last year when Diane McBaine,
the movie actress, visited one of our practice sessions
as a publicity stunt to promote her latest flick starring
Elvis and others. She gave each of us a little gold “D”,
suitable for putting on a girl’s charm bracelet, which
I am relieved to say that none of us wore. Lefty asked
her what the “D’’ represented. Naturally she said,
“Davidson,” and she was very confused to learn from
Lefty that, the “D’” denoted DEFENSE! After seeing
Miss McBaine, the team was sure the “D” stood for

Diane.

Following our poor showing in the VMI game,
the newspaper reporters heard Lefty vow that he was
going to find ‘those on the team who could play de-
fense.” Despite this statement, the bench did not get
too excited. As we figured, the starting team for the
Furman game was basically the same with the excep-
tion of Cook’s replacing Moser. Incidentally, following
the game Tuesday night, Lefty commented that Moser
played as well as anyone and that benching him must
have given him added incentive. Lefty went on to say,
“Maybe I won’t ever start him again!” Dave had no

comment.

Despite our defensive flaws, or offensive, as the
case might be, we have won three games, even if the
teams we defeated were not exactly national power.

t

houses. Our schedule really starts Saturday w

h the

game against Michigan. Most of us remember, as do
those who saw the game last year, how we blew a nine
point lead with five minutes left and lost to Michigan.
Still, revenge does not win games and we know it. To
beat Michigan both offense and defense will have to

be “hardnosed.”

Catfish Outswim
Clock, Still Lose

Last Friday's opening
swimming meet was spoiled
for the ‘Catfish, as the Uni-
versity of Virginia won, 58-46.
Coach Tom Stevens was
pleased with Davidson's per-
formance, however, as sever-
al school records were brok-
en.

“I was really happy with
the boys’ performance this
early in the season,"’ Stevens
said. ‘“‘I hope that by the end
of the year we can break all
the schoo] records.”

Freshman Jack Steele

ted the assault on the rec-
ord book, setting new
schoo! marks in both the
100 and 200 yard free style
events. His record-sefting
time in the 100 was 51.8
seconds. His 1:56.6 in the
200 yard race broke the
existing pool record as well
as the school mark.

Bill. Woodson, another
freshman, broke the old
school record in the 500 yard
free style with a time of
5:49.5. Davidson swimmers
approached records in sev-
eral other events.

‘Although the ‘Catfish lost
the meet, they won more first

places thar Virginia. In ad-
dition to Steele’s two wins
and Woodson‘s victory. Da-
vidson won four other events.
Mac Davis won the 50 yard
free style.

Team captain Eddie
Beach won the 200 yard in-
dividual mediey. The Da.
vidson relay team won both
the 400 yard mediey relay
and the 400 yard free style
relay.

The swimmers are to have
faced a strong Wake Forest
team today at 3 in Johnston
Gym. Although Stevens feels
that Wake Forest is a strong-
er team, he predicted that the
meet would be an interesting
one. ;

Hopeful Cagers Overcome
Raggedness, Win Openers

Showing flashes of the bril-
liance that Wildcat fans hope
will be its signature, David-
son’s basketball team won
its first three games. The
wins came over Bucknell
University, Virginia Mflitary
Institute and Furman Uni.
versity.

Although aspects of the
team's play were sloppy at
times, most observers are
convinced that this year. can
be a very big one for the
‘Cats. “Any team with as
much talent as this will start
off ragged. But I don't see
how they can be anything but
successful,"' said William &
Mary scout Hubie Brown.
Brown had just watched the
team win a rather lackluster
victory over Bucknell, 91-70.

in that game Davidson
played hot and cold basket-

ball. They shot a torrid 61

percent from the floor, but

gave the ball away 22

times on turnovers. The

‘Cats showed .a lot of in-
dividual strength in that

game with Mike Maloy,

Rod Knowles, Doug Cook

and Wayne Huckel hitting

in double figures. But the
feam play was not impres-
sive.

Then in the second game
the defense faltered and the
Keydets of VMI gave Wiid-
cat followers something to
squirm about before falling
80-73. VMI, led by pesky 5-9
John Kemper, pulled within

‘opposition

five points with three min-
utes left to play. But two
timely free throws by Dave
Moser and four = straight
points by Huckel pulled the
game out of reach.

Then in the third start
the Wildcats put |? all to-
gether to swamp Furman
95-68. The defense grudg-
ingly gave up only 23

field goals. Meanwhile the
offense maintained control
of the floor show, no mat-
ter who was in the game.
Homer Garr, who had jour-
neyed to Davidson to scout
for Vanderbilt, said after
watching the ‘Cat perfor-
mance, “Watching a game
like this is enough to ruin
a man’s trip.”

The next two games on the
schedule will be particularly
tough. Michigan will face the
‘Cats in the Coliseum tomor-
row night. Then Tuesday the
Wildcats challenge Vander-
bilt, in Nashville. The team’s
success for the season will
be determined to a large ex-
tent by the results of these
games.

Freshman Scoring Factory
Sweeps Opposition Aside

By DOUG HAYNES
Sports Writer

Powerful offense, team
depth, and a relatively weak
defense characterize this
year’s freshman basketball
team. In winning their first
three games, the ‘Kittens
have topped the century
mark all three times, with
at least eight frosh scoring
in each game. However, the
is averaging a
whopping 88 points a game.

North Greenville Jr. Col-
lege fell to Davidson in the
Dec. 1 season opener, 114-
101. Both teams were over-
anxious, resulting in numer-
ous turnovers. But the next
night in Charlotte, the ‘Kit-
ten offense jelled into ‘a bet-
ter unit and whipped Clem-
son 105-73. Head freshman

coach Jerry Conboy consid-
ered the first half of the
Clemson game to be their
best defensive effort yet this
season. The halftime ‘core
was 51-20.

The ‘Kittens battled the
highly regarded freshmen
from Furman Dec. 5. The
Baby Paladins had a quick
offense, but it was no match
for the crowd-inspired ‘Kit-
tens. Playing less as individ-
uals and more as a team.
Davidson leaped to an early
lead, controlled the game
and crushed Furman 112-92.

For the three games, Da-
vidson's top scorers are:
Ricky Snipes with a 30.3
average, Steve Kirley, 23.7:
Duncan Postma. 15.3; and
Mark Affeldt, 15.7.

Cook Leads Hoopsters
Through Opening Wins

By JAMES ROLAND
Sports Writer

Davidson’s much heralded
crowd of sophomores have
made their varsity basket-
ball debut, and already so-
phomore Doug Cook has
emerged as a leader.

Against Furman, the 6-6
Cook led the Wildcats in
scoring, while playing less
than half the game. He
scored 19 points in 18 min-
utes, thrilling the crowd with
steals, fast breaks, and one
behind-the-back layup that
nobody believed.

There was one believer,
however, in the press box.
Homer Garr, assistant
coach at Vanderbilt
thought Cook was the
strongest man on the floor
Tuesday night. “He's got
all the moves of a smail
man, plus size and
strength,” Garr said. “He
could've scored 40 points
if he'd played the whole
game.”

Cook .also starred against
Bucknell and VMI. He leads
the Wildcats with a 17.6
points per game average, hit-
ting a strong 61 per cent of
his field goal attempts after
the first three games.

“He's agile. quick," said
Coach Tharles (Lefty) Drie-
sell of his sophomore stand-
out, ‘‘and has as good offen-
sive moves as any I've seen,

maybe the best in the coun-
try. But he needs to get to
the boards more and improve
his defense. Of course, he's
got the speed and the mental
alertness he needs, and he'll
gain experience. Doug will
be a great aid to the team
when he develops."

Cook’s development as a
roundball star has been go-
‘ing on for a long time. He
played organized ball in the
fifth grade, in Ho Ho Kus,
N. J. In the seventh and
eighth grades, when he was
5-11, he helped his grammar
school to a 48-0 record. “‘I
was the shortest starter we
had,"' Cook said, describing
his contributions,

Last year, while helping
the Wildkittens to their per-
fect 16-0 season, Cook was
second in scoring with a 22.5
points per game average,
and picked up 14 rebounds
a game.

“I don’t get too many re-
bounds this year because I
play further out, as a wing
man,”* he said. “Last year I
played close enough in to get
a few.” Cook is grabbing six
rebounds a game now.

Asked why he chose Da-

The ‘Kittens will play one
of their toughest games Sat-
urday night against the
Duke freshmen. The Blue
Imps could be the team to
snap Davidson's undefeated
streak at 19 games that in-
cludes last year’s 16 wins.

Duke has one of the best
teams in the urea, including
three high school All-Ameri-
cans. Assistant coach Terry
Holland admitted this rat:
ing. but quickly added,
“They'll get a chance to
prove it Saturday -night.”'
The Duke freshmen will
have a height advantage.
The tip-off will be at 6:15 in
the Charlotte Coliseum.

To the coaches. defense is
the biggest problem facing
the ‘Kittens. Holland said,
*"We need a lot more work
on defense. We don't have
any height should Snipes or
Kirley get into foul trouble.”

Both Holland and varsity
coach Charles (Lefty) Drie-
sell stressed the importance
of an enthusiastic backing
for the freshmen. especially
Saturday night.

JACK JACOBS STRAINS TO ESCAPE
But Keydet opponent holds on for 152 pound victory.

Grapplers Drop Matches
To Powerful VMI, Duke

Davidson's young wrest-
ling team dropped its first
two ineets of the season. The
first loss was at thé hands of
VMI, last Friday, 22-11.
Then on Monday, the 'Cats
were beaten by Duke on the
Blue Devil mats, 21-12.

A lack of experience was a
problem in both matches.
Davidson wrestles with five
freshmen, under the new
ruling allowing freshmen to
participate in varsity wrest-
ling. Both Duke and VMI
used more upper classmen
than Davidson.

The ‘Cats jumped to an
early 11-0 lead over VMI
by winning the first three
events. Then the Keydets
showed their strength in
the middle and upper
weight classes.

Colin Hudson won his 123
pound match by a pin. Dean
Cromartie won a decision in

the 130 pound event. Then.
freshman Joe Cabanas out-
lasted his opponent in the 137
pound class, to win a décis-
ion.

The Duke match was an-
other close one for the
‘Cats. Davidson wrestlers
won four matches against
the Blue Devils. Hudson
won his second straight in
the 123 pound division, this
time by decision. Cromar-
tle gained his second 130
pound win.

Freshman Jack Jacobs
won an upset victory for the
‘Cats in the 152 pound event.
Lowell Bryan added the
fourth Davidson victory in the
heavy weight competition.

The. third meet of the sea-
son is to have been held, to-
day in Williamsburg, Va. The
grapplers met William &
Mary in a Southern Confer-
ence match.
