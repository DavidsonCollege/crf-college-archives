DR. SPRUNT PROMINENT
DAVIDSON ALUMNUS

Former Davidson Athlete and Lit-
erary Man Ranks High in Life.

Dr. Alexander Sprunt, D.D., was born
in Glasgow, Scotland, July 10, 1852. He
came to this countfy in his infancy. His
father traded in the West Indies for a!
while and finally settled in Wilmington,
N. C., where he established a large and
flourishing exporting concern which _ is
still in existence today..

Dr. Sprunt’s boyhod was spent in Wil-
mington. He was a playmate of Wood-
row Wilson’s, and attended the church
where Wilson’s father was pastor. He
was too young to enter the civil war.

His preparatory education was begun
in Wilmington and completed in Upper
Canada College,,Toronto, Canada. From
there he came to Davidson in 1871. While
in Davidson he was captain of the base-
ball team, besides being secretary, treas-
urer, and president of the Philanthropic
Literary Society. He graduated from
Davidson in 1875 and then entered Union
Theological Seminary of Virginia, which
was then located at Hampden-Sidney,
Va. He graduated from Union Seminary
in 1878,

On April 30, 1879, he was married to
Miss Ellen R. Peck, the daughter of Dr.
Thomas C. Peck, who was then a pro-
fessor in Union Seminary.

Among the pastorates held by Dr.
Sprunt have been churches in Hender-
son, N. C.; Rock Hill, S. C., and Charles-
ton, S. C. He was called to the First
Presbyterian Church of Charleston 21
years ago and has served there faith-
fully ever since. Under Dr. Sprunt’s
leadership the Church in Charleston has
grown until now it has a membership of
over 500.

Dr. Sprunt belongs to one of the most
widely known and widely esteemed fam-
ilies of the Carolinas. He is very loyal
to Davidson, having been a trustee for
many years. He is himself an excellent
Gospel preacher—sane, scriptural, sub-
stantial, and able—and loved by all who
know him. May there be other David-
son men to follow so good an example
as that set by Dr. Sprunt.

DAVIDSON ALUMNUS
HONORED.

Ben Lacy to Deliver Baccalaureate
Sermon at University of N. C.

Rev. Benjamin R .Lacy, Jr., ’06, who de-
livered the Armistice Day address at
Davidson fast fall, is to deliver the bac-
calaureate sermon at the University of
North Carolina this year. The sermon
will be delivered on Sunday, June 11, and
will be the first event of comménce-
ment week at the University.

‘Dr. Lacy is at present pastor of the
Central Presbyterian Church of Atlanta,
Ga. He is the son of the state treasurer
of North Carolina. He was a Rhodes
scholar at Oxford University.

He is widely known because of _ his
war record. In 1917 he joined the 113th
field artillery, goth division, as regimen-
tal chaplain. Not content to perform the
usual duties of spiritual guide for the
officers and soldiers, he set out to learn
artillery. He did this task so well that
the general commanding the 3oth divis-
ion remarked at an officers’ meeting one
day in France:

“I don’t set myself up as a judge of
chaplains. I suppose Lacy is a first-rate
chaplain, but what I know positively is
that he is one of the best artillerymen
in the brigade.”

Throughout all the fierce engagements
of the 113th artillery’ Chaplain Lacy
stayed with it and became known as
“The Fighting Parson.” He returned
from France with the artillery in 1919
and has since taken the pastorate of the
Central Presbyterian Church of Atlanta.

Everything for QUALITY
—nothing for show

HAT’S OUR IDEA in making
CAMELS—the Quality Cigarette.

Why, just buy Camels and look at the package!
It’s the best packing science has devised to keep
cigarettes fresh and full flavored for your taste.
Heavy paper outside—secure foil wrapping inside
and the revenue stamp over the end to seal the pack-
age and keep it air-tight. —

And note this! There’s nothing flashy about the
Camel package. No extra wrappings that do not
improve the smoke. - Not a cent of needless expense
that must come out of the quality of the tobacco.

Camels wonderful and exclusive Quality wins on
merit alone.

Because, men smoke Camels who want the.
taste and fragrance of the finest tobaccos, expertly
blended. Men smoke Camels for Camels smooth,
refreshing mildness and their freedom from ciga-
retty aftertaste.

- Camels are made for men who think for them-
selves.
