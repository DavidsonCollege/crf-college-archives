through to midnight, March 14, with Tuesday, Wednes-
day, and Thursday's program ending at 10:30 p.m. and
Friday's activities terminating at 12:00 midnight.

“Greek Week is the channel-
ing of fraternity energy toward
constructive endeavor, with
particular interest in promot-
ing greater cooperation among
fraternities and better prepara-
tion of pledges for fraternity
life,” as defined in the Greek
Week Report of the Pan-Hell-
enic Council, Fraternity Presi-
dents Committee on Greek
Week.

its purposes are: “(1) To
Promote acquaintance and
good feeling among chapters,
(2) To best prepare pledges
for membership in their own
fraternity, (3) To achieve a
solidarity within each chap-
ter respecting its pledges and
brothers, (4) To better justi-
fy fraternity existence, and
(5) To nut fraternity in a bet-
ter light before the public
eye by means of constructive
projects.” .

As stated in a report by the
IFC, “Any pre-initiation - prac-
tice which incurs loss of sleep,
physical harm, interruption of
school work, personal humilia-
tion or punishment (either pri-
vate or public) or any other
general distasteful _ practice
which - jeopardizes the good
name of the college or fraterni-
ty is condemned. Future pre.ini-
tiation ceremonies will be of
a constructive nature regulated
by the IFC.”

“Hazing,” was defined in
a letter from National Fra-
ternity, “as a public display
shall consist of any and all
‘forms of public appearance
which may result in adverse
publicity to the fraternity, as
“physical abuse” shall be in-
terpreted to mean any prac-
tice, whether internal or ex-
ternal, which is apt to be de-
trimontal to the health and
well being of a pledge, as

scholastic interference shall
consist of any and all prac-
tices which place pledges in
the position of being unable
to attend or properly prepare

themselves for classes, and
8s moral indignity shall be
defined. as actions which by

their ethical, moral, and so-
cial = implications, when
viewed in the light of so-
cially accepted standards of
right and wrong, which may

At a meeting of the fraterni-
ty pledge trainers and several
IFC members on February 18,
Vernon Anderson. IFC Presi-
dent, emphasized, “What I want
to impress.is not to interpret
the letter of the law but the
spirit of it. We don’t want this
to have to go before the facul-
ty.”

“It will be necessary to exert
some active influence against
some things which have been,
traditional in the past,” added
Richard Brubaker. IFC Secre
tary. “I guarantee it'll realty
work if you'll. get behind it,”

On the subject of having a
field day organized, the point
was brought up that some
fraternities were dubious as
to entering because of nu-
merical disadvantages. Thus
a majority vote decided to
have field day based on in-

dividual fraternity chal-
lenges.
“Our original idea was to

have an organized deal with
times, events, and all fraterni-
ties entered. But this wotild
take away from the social pro-
jects. Field d:y was meant to
fill the void caused by the
abolition in Greck Weck of
some activities of Hell Week.
It was designed. to help fill a
total program. By individual
fraternities challenging each
other, it will have to be planned
well by the pledge trainers.
This is as good a thing as you
can do to replace harassment,
ete.”

The Vereen Bell Memorial
Award is given in the

be, memory of a Davidson alum-

nus of the class of 1932,
Vereen Bell (1911-1944). Bell
was killed in ection in the
Second Battle of the Philip-

pines. He had published two |

novels, “Swamp Water” and
“Two of a Kind,” and many
short stories about outdoor
life in Georgia.

idea of the sweeping changes

Overall, the 1970 cadet will

changing conditions of warfare.
His training program will be
altered to include the newest
aspects of military life and ac-
tivity. The ROTC program here
as well as elsewhere will be
changed to mect new demands.

Uniformwise, the soldier
