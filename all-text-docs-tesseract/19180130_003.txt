The meeting of the Eumenean Society

The Philanthropic Society held its
regular meeting on last Saturday night.
The subject for debate was: “Resolved.
That the proposed Peace League should
he adopted at the close of the war.” The
affirmative was upheld by G. McDon-
ald, the negative by L. L. Wilson. Me-
Donald contended that peace was attain-
ed only thru co-operation, while Wilson
contended’ that the proposed Peace
League would be contrary to the customs
of the United States and that. it does
nat go far enough. The judges decided
in favor of the negative.

The society then enjoved interesting
orations on “Our. Progress in the Air,”
by Peters: “Our Duty,” by McClure:
and “Our Calamity,” by Hart.

Following this was a spirited extem-
poraneous debate on “Resolved, That
Intercollegiate Athletics are injurious to
the student body as a whole.” J. W.
Clark supported the affirmative and W.
C. Neel the negative. Clark also gave
some timely hints regarding needed re-
forms in the society. The judges de-
cided unanimously in favor of the affrm-
ative,

DEBATING “REPS”
AWARDED MONDAY NIGHT

Last Monday night in the Eumenean
Society there were six members who en-
tered into competition for the “reps” for
the debating team. The competitors
were at liberty to make their own selec-
tions of the side they would uphold.
which resulted in one man selecting the
affirmative, and five the negative. Cou-
sar was the unassisted contender, and
Bellingrath. J. R. Woods, Wm. Love,
Flinn and Potts made up the side that
took the opposition. The subject for
debate was, “Resolved, That the success-
ful prosecution of the war requires that
all the citizens of Germany, Austria,
‘Bulgaria, and Turkey, now residing in
this country, should be interned during
the period of the war.” _

Cousar. representing the affirmative,
contended that, first, enemy aliens are
impeding the prosecution of the war;
second, internment will put an end to

ment has been started at Vanderbilt to
procure two service flags for the univer-

sired for all those who have entered the
Army from Vanderbilt. A dime from
each professor and student will make
possible these service flags, fitting remem-
brances of those who have gone from

propaganda and destruction of property:
third, they are destroying property by
fire, and in that way are rendering great
damage to the nation, and creating a
great impediment to the successful prose-
cution of the war. ‘lhe other five men.
upholding the negative side of the ques-
tion, put forth these arguments: Such
a course would not be in accordance with
international law; it would be an un-
necessary addition to our legislation: it
would not be practicable; it would be an
economic mistake: sufficient precaution
has already been taken; ‘Vurks and Bul-
garians could not be included: it is not
necessary for the successful prosecution
of the war. “he debates were all well
gotten up, and were written and deliv-
ered in a convincing way, and strength.
ened with verifying statistics, and good
authority. “Phe winners of the “reps”
were, R. W. Cousar, A. S. Potts, Win.
Love and J. R. Woods, with C. G. Bel-
‘ingrath alternate.

In the Phi Society the affirmative was
upheld by = Messrs. McClure and
Thames, who showed that the spy svs-
tem had not yet been met successfully
and that the proposed plan would ac-
complish this. “The negative, defended
by Messrs. Chalmers, Howell, Cum:
ming, Currie, Kdwards and FE. L.
Knight, who proved that the spy was too
sharp to be caught by this clumsy method
and that the harm done to American fa-
bor would be very great. [t was also
brought out that the cost of internment
would be excessive.

After rather spirited rejoinders, the
three judges, Drs. Arbuckle. Harding
and Richards, decided in favor of Messrs.
