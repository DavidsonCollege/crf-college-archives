Book-Of-The Year Deals

With Communist Menace

Book-of-the Year for 1962. John C. Ben-
Christian theology and ethics and dean of the faculty at Union

Theological Seminary in New York City, will present his book during a two-day
visit to campus on March 26-27.

Bennett's book attempts to
present the Christian approach
to the Communist idea-system.
It sees the basic conflict as ly-
ing in the field of social or-
ganization rather than in oppos-

ing military complexes. Bennett
analyses the threat of atheistic
absolutism in light of threats of
nuclear extinction. The Chris-
tian Century saw in Bennett’s
approach “refreshing sanity and

College Will Require
$100 Tuition Deposit

Davidson students planning to enroll in the college
for the 1962-63 term will have to pay a non-refundable
$100 deposit on tuition by March 15, according to a new
administrative policy announced to THE DAVIDSONIAN

today.

President D. Grier Martin re-
lated the policy change to the
problem of adequately estimat-
ing student body enrollment.
“We are committed to enroll
1,000 students, and we are try-
ing to serve that maximum num-
ber. This is the, best way we
know how to do it,” he explain-
ed.

COMBINATION FEE

The $100 due next month
combines the $25 room deposit
formerly required in the early
spring and the $75 tuition de-
posit which is due in July and
which the college began last
year. Incoming freshmen have
been required for two years to
submit a $100 tuition deposit
upon notification of their ac-
ceptance.

Letters announcing the new
policy were being sent to par-
ents this week by M. W. Me-
Gill, college bursar. Notices will
be distributed soon in all dormi-
tories and invoices will be mail-
ed to students on or around
March 1. Students planning to
return next year will be re-
sponsible for meeting the March
15 deadline,

If a student does not pay the
$100, the college will assume
he does not plan to return to
Davidson. If at a later date,
the individual does decide to
return, he will have to apply
through the Admissions Com-
mittee. The decision on his re-
entry will depend on the avail-
ability of spaces in the next
year’s student body.

SPECIAL REFUNDS

If a student has paid the de-
posit, but circumstances beyond
his control prevent his register-
ing the next September, he may
apply for a refund. Refunds
will not be made, however, for
voluntary drop-outs or transfers.

Mathematician Is
Visiting Lecturer

Professor R. Creighton Buck
of the University of Wisconsin
will be on campus Feb. 11-13 as
a lecturer under the Program
of Visiting Lecturers of the
Mathematical Association of
America.

Professor Buck received his
‘PhD in mathematics from Har-
vard in 1947. Before going to
Wisconsin he served on the
faculty of Brown University and
as a Guggenheim Fellow, he
served as a guest professor at
Stanford University.

Prof. Buck will deliver a lec-
ture in “Linear Spaces and
the Calculus” on Monday at
8:20 a.m. in 227 Chambers. Al
4:45 in Room 114, Dana Science
Building, he will talk on “Ap
plying Mathematics.” One hour
prior to this lecture, there will
be a coffee at the Faculty Club
in Jackson Court for students
and faculty to meet Professor
Buck. The following day at 11:00
am., he will deliver another
lecture in 114 Dana, on “Re
search in Mathematics.”

The talks Mon. afternoon and
Tues. morning are designed for
general audiences with little
mathematical background.

Professor Buck will be avail-

1,000 student enroliment pre-
cipitated the action. With the
more definite estimate of re-
turning students which the $100
deposit will afford, the Admis-
sions Committee will have a
clearer idea of the number of
freshmen and transfers .to ac-
cept.
MORE TRANSFERS

“The emphasis will come in
accepting more transfers, rather
than greatly increasing the num-
ber of freshmen admitted,” ex-
plained H. Edmunds White, di-
rector of ‘admissions. “We an-
ticipate a freshman class very
much the same general size as
this year’s.”

The present student body en-
rollment is around 955 students.
It was four years ago that the
trustees of the college voted
to increase the size of the stud-
ent body from 800 to 1,000. To
accommodate the increase,
Richardson Dormitory was con-
structed. President Martin this
week announced the addition of
even five more finished rooms
to that building.

Dr. Martin explained that the
$100 deposit is a measure being
used by many colleges today for
gauging enrollment. “Here at
Davidson, the only real change
is one of timing,” he comment-
ed.

RHODES SCHOLAR

Bennett is well-known in the
field of church and state rela-
tions. A graduate of Williams
College and a Rhodes scholar,
Bennett aiso studied at Union
Seminary in New York. He has
written Christien Ethies and
Social Policy, The Christian as
Citizen, and Christians and the
State. He is editor of the maga-
zine Christianity and Crisis.

Christianity and Communism
Today is published by Haddam
House of The Association Press
in New York, a YMCA-operated
publishing firm. The book is a
revision of Bennett's Christian-
ity and Communism, first pub-
lished in 1947. The YMCA at
Davidson hopes to get a reduc-
tion on the $3.50 price when
offering the book to students.

Bennett has said in his book,
“The American Christian should
be especially watchful when
hysterical fear of Communism
on the part of economic conser-
vatives and the zeal of military
branches of his own government
seek to prepare the minds of
the American people for a mili-
tary showdown.”

IMPORTANT ISSUE

Program chairman Lowry
Reid commented on the selec-
tion of Bennett’s book. ‘The
Book-of-the-Year | Committee
feels that this book deals with
one of the most important is-
sues facing Americans today.
The Y hopes a program bulit
around this book will tie in with
previous speakers and forums
on Communism, while giving a
different approach to the prob-
lem.”

Bennett had been offered
three different spring speaking
dates. The committee received
confirmation of the March dates
Thursday. Reid said, “Several
students have expressed inter-
est in helping with the various
details involved in the Book-of-
the-Year. We will be calling on
them for help soon.”

“The Greek Week projects were exceptional and
were a merit to the fraternity system and Davidson. Col-
lege as a whole,” was the opinion expressed by IFC
President Bob Waugh. “They created a lot of goodwill in

Mooresville in particular.”

Waugh, when interviewed by
THE DAVIDSONIAN prior to
the IFC’s Monday night meeting,
again expressed his disappoint-
ment in Skit Night:

| was diseppointed with
the subject matter of some of
the skits and with what ep-
peared to be the skimpy e-
mount of time put in by some
fraternities.”

When asked for an overall
estimate of Greek Week, Waugh
teplied that the individual fra-
ternities would be better quali-
fied to express an opinion.

At the meeting following the
interview, two proposals con-
cerning Skit Night were laid be-
fore the group. One was that the
event be scheduled earlier in
the year and not in conjunction
with Greek Week; the other was
that all skits be reviewed by
the fraternities’ faculty advisors.

Diseussion followed, and e

unanimous recommendation
to next year’s IFC resulted:
“Before a skit may be present-
ed to a public audience, it
must be reviewed by the fra
ternity’s faculty advisor or
some other member of the
feculty, who will sponsor its
production.”

The group also gave as a
statement of policy: “The IFC in
entirety is opposed to the sub-
ject matter of some of last
week’s skits. In the future, such
lack of good taste will constitute

Debaters
Journey
To FSU

While Davidson College is at
the height of the Feb. 16-17 Mid-
winters’ festivities, four mem-
bers of the debate team will be

‘at Florida State University’s

13th annual Invitational Debate
Tournament.

Representing Davidson in
the competition, which in- ,
cludes such schools as Miami
Unwersity, Georgia Tech, Uni-
versity of Florida, Auburn,
Tulane, L. S. U., and Mississip-
pi State University, will be
the team of Tom Poston, Bob
Liewellyn, Harry Daniel, and
Bill Brown.

This year Davidson will enter
only the senior division but Dr.
Joe Drake, team coach, says he
is expecting the boys to do «
good job and certainly to im-
prove last year’s 50-50 record.
In addition to the six rounds of
debating Coach Drake plans to
enter Harry Daniel in the ora-
tion competition and Tom Pos-
ton in the area of after-dinner
speaking.

To add a little variety to
the proceedings, the last two
rounds will depart from the
usual rules of debate. Each
participant will be ailowed
the freedom of cross-examina-
tion in a courtroonrtype pro-
cedure.

Having worked together for
the first time at the Appalachian
State meet, there compiling a
6-4 record, the team will be
secking a perfect slate in Flori-
da. Upon returning from the
deep South, the Davidson Col-
lege Debaters will have four
meets remaining on their sched-
ule.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 0, 1962

MAJORITY SAYS YES TO TRUSTEES

the Student Council, com-
mented, “I attribute the fact
that more did not answer
the poll to a lack of opinion
on the part of many of the
students, which is to me a
little disappointing. espec-
ially om an issue of such
gravity.”

In a breakdown by class-
es, 63 percent of the fresh-
men, 60 percent of the soph-
omores, 55 percent of the
juniors, and 56 percent of
the seniors made their
choice during the first four
periods Monday and Tues-
day of this weck.

The method of balloting
used was that currently em-
ployed in elections with
each student having his
name checked off when he
votes.

Two years ago a similar
poll produced a result that

was dubious due to the poor
method of distribution, the
possibility of ballot box
stuffing, the vagueness of
the wording, and the many
alternate choices of the poll
itself.

Trask stated earlier, “Re-
cently the faculty resolved
that no qualified student
should be denied admission
because of race or nation-
ality. We feel that now is
the opportune moment to
express student opinion.

“Thus our purpose will be
two-fold, first to indicate
any change in student opin-
ion as nearly as possible,
but primarily to express
student opinion to the
Bvard of Trustees concern-
ing the admission, of Ne-
groes to Davidson.”

The Trustees will hear
the results of both the fac-

ulty and student polls at
their annual spring meet-
ing Feb. 21.

In the earlier poll 46 per
eent of the 647 who replied
believed “that Davidson
should not in any way con-
sider the matter of admis-
sion of Negroes.” Only 19
per cent proposed integra-
tion” at the earliest possi-
ble date,” but 47 per cent
felt that the way for inte-
gration should be clear,
either in the present or
future.

“The change,” said Trask,
“is not as great as I expect-
ed. The percentage of those
in favor of segregation has
remained constant, indicat-
ing hardly any change of
sentiment.”

“This poll, however,” he
continued, “is totally ac-
curate and we have taken
every precaution to make it

impartial, by expressing no
opinions beforehand and by
conducting no campaign of
any sort to influence the re-
sult.”

Several students wrote
comments on the ballots
themselves. One student
favored integration, “but
not of any student just to
say Davidson is integrated.”

Another also. favored in-
tegration, “although I feel
such applicants should be
screened more carefully
than white applicants just
to avoid any unfortunate
incidents in the early stages
of a program of this type.”

In 1959, the trustees vot-
ed it was not “in the best
interests of Davidson Col-
lege” to integrate at that
time. Last year the racial
barrier ‘was lowered to al-
low Congolese students to
enroll.

Off-Campus Drinking Rule

PETER S. NEY IV, Davidson's most recently acquired “living
endowment,” found new freedom this week when he took up

Wildcat Home At Last;
Cage Is No-Man’s Land

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Come Sunday afternoon you’re apt to see an unusual number of cars on the
drive behind the Union. Focus of the new interest is Peter Stuart Ney IV, “home”

at last in his new cage.

The $450 structure was de-
signed by Clif Loudermilk, Char-
ley Safley, and Grover C. Meetze,
director of the Physical Plant.
Add to this the initial cost of
the ‘cat, the trailer, a showcase
planned by Alpha Phi Omega,
and food and medicine and Ney
amounts to nearly a thousand
dollar investment.

Joe Martin, generalissimo of
Davidson’s cheerleaders, gave
these figures as reason enough
to treat the. ‘cat with some
respect, to say nothing of his
stetus as officiel mascot.

But students are still annoy-
ing the ‘cat, warily, in his new,
and more accessible hatitat.
Martin suggested one partial
remedy for this teasing—have
anyone who puts extraneous
matter into the cage go in and
get it back.

Except for the abuses of un-
patriotic collegians, how is Ney,
whom Martin calls “Kitty” (“He
doesn't respond to name-<all-
ing”), adjusting to his new en-
virons? "He’s got more room to
back off, so he feels a little

safer,” said Martin. But the
tempering effect of Davidson’s
easy living has not yet had its
effect on her newest son.

The dogs have been having
their troubles Martin § said.
They usually visit once, but
no more. Within eighteen
inches of the cage is still no
man’s land. No one else has
had serious run-ins with Kitty,
except the colored workmen
who built the cage. They lived
in terror of the new occupant
moving in early.

But if dogs or humans get too
bad, Ney has a big concrete floor
to stalk apout on, and the lux-
ury of a pool (with controls
outside the cage) and tree com-
plete with penthouse for the
local monsoons. There is also
for his convenience a sandbox,
the significance of which has
not yet occured to him.

This plush pad does present
some problems, however. It was
purposely placed on a_ well
traveled route, and will soon be
graced with guard rail and spot-
lights covering the surrounding

area. But Martin pointed to the
possibility of ‘catnapping or
Citadel’s spray-cans and trust-
ed to Providence, the Davidson
Security Force, and Peter Ney.
On the brighter side, Martin
envisioned the new pen as a
trophy case for “borrowed”
parephernalie to be added to
the basketball belonging,
formerly, to the Purple Pala-
dins. Martin issued the call
for trophies that students had
in their room: “If you don’t
think that they are safe, bring
them down end we'll put them
in the vault.”

In less than a week, then, Ney
and his new home were the sub-
ject of planning, circuitous
routes on the part of the jani-
tors, and just plain looking. As
yet unadorned by signs pro-
claiming Davidson athletic
schedules and unprotected by
iron curtain security, Peter
Stuart Ney IV stared back at a
pretty coed visitor, endured her
sugary “Hello, Kitty,” and
growled indulgently from the
safety of his new domain.

At its Tuesday meeting the faculty at large defeated
a motion proposing that cases of drinking at off-campus
events be handled according to the “ungentlemanly-

conduct clause.”

The motion came from within
the. faculty in response to a
written request from the Stud-
ent Council, dated Dec. 8, 1961,
that such a motion be adopted.

DIVIDED OPINION

No action was Immediately
taken because of a divided opin-
ion within the Executive Com-
mittee. Unable to agree on the
proposal, the committee waited
and presented the matter be-
fore: the full faculty. Prior to the
meeting Tuesday, copies of the
Student Council letter were cir-
culated among the faculty mem-
bers for their inspection and
consideration.

The meeting was a long one,
being devoted mostly to this
problem. According to President
D. Grier Martin, it was “a ques-
tion on which there is disagree-
ment in the faculty.” The mo
tion was debated and discussed
at length before its defeat.

RULE AS NOW STATED

The existing drinking rule is
stated, ‘Davidson Oollege is op-
posed as a matter of principle
to the use of alcoholic bever-
ages by students. A student will
ordinarily be suspended if he
is found guilty of drinking, pos-
sessing or being under the in-
fluence of an alcoholic beverage
while within the town limits of
Davidson or while attending any
off-campus event sponsored en-
tirely or in part by Davidson
College.

Referring to action taken by
the Executive Committee re-
cently against eight students in-
volvet in an off-campus-event
drinking incident, the Student
Council letter protested “both
the severity of the punishment
levied against the students and
the limits of the regulation it-
self.”

Their proposal that cases be
tried under the “ungentlemanly-

Freshman Council
Sponsors Dance

The Freshman Council is
sponsoring a dance tomorrow
night after the basketball game
with V.MLI. as its first project of
the second semester.

The Hub Knox Combo will
provide the music for the dance
which will begin immediately
after the game and will end at
11:30.

In addition the council is con-
sidering the possibility of spon-
soring the chartering of a Dav-
idson chapter of Phi Eta Sigma,
which is an honorary national
fraternity similar to Phi Beta
Kappa except that its member-
ship is restricted to freshman.

The council also appointed a
Cultural Fund Committee to de-
termine how the money contri-
buted earlier by the Freshman
Class for the Richardson Schol-
ars will be used.

conduct clause” would mean
that no action would be taken
against the possession or drink-
cing of alcohol per se at off-
campus events. Rather, cases
would be tried with conduct as
the only consideration, regard-
less of whether the person in
question was drinking or not.
APPROVES SOCIAL CLUB
The faculty did approve a
motion by Prof. Sam Maloney
for the formation of a new,
non-exclusive social organiza-
tion. ;
This organization, as describ-
ed in more detail in last week's
DAVIDSONIAN, would offer
more social facilities for Inde-
pendents. The college has secur.
ed a house for the organization,
and all members would be re-
quired to pay a moderate initia-
tion fee and semester dues.

Atkins Will Head
Elections Board

An upcoming seminar to be
held by the National Student As
sociation and the organization
of the Elections Board were the
main items discussed by the
Student Council at their meet-
ing Wed. night.

Clay Atkins was elected chair-
man of the Elections Board. At-
kins, Newt Burns, and Bob
Hord will be responsible for
laying the basic groundwork for
the elections. The membership
of the elections board is made
up of one senior representative
from each fraternity and four
senior independents.

The council decided to send
a single delegate to- the NSA's
Academic Freedom Seminar on
Student Involvement in Extra-
Campus Affairs, which will be
held at Duke University on Feb.
23-25.

The seminar will be composed
of six sessions of discussions on
various topics related to univer-
sity student participation in af:
fairs outside the campus. The
final session will be a general
discussion and summation led
by Paul Potter, the vice-presi-
dent of the N.S.A.

Following the regular meet-
ing of the Student Council,
President George Trask met
with the members of the elec-
tions board, which sets up elec.
tion procedures and dates, and
conducts the elections.

Members of the committee
are Atkins, Burns, Hord, Tom
Martin, Dan Calhoun, Skeeter
Watson, Doug Purington, Lou
Zirgle, Buddy Brauch, and Dave
Jordan.

Also Bill Godwin, Mike Mad-
dox, Rush Woodside, Harold.
Fisher, Bob Bradford, and Zeb
Vance.
