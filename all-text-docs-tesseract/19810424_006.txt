Old Men 10, Pax 2

The number one and number two teams, Bone and Perpetual
Perpetrators, have suffered defeats since my last article. Right
now, that means Eddie Searcher is the only team with an
unblemished record. Eddie Searcher (KA) is the ultimately solid
team: they don’t make many errors and they hit well.

The tournament will be starting soon and although KA may
appear to be the frontrunner any of the top teams can still win it
all.

A reminder to all IMAC contenders: don’t forget to turn in

Perhaps the beautiful weath-
er or maybe Davidson mid-term
week was distracting, but the

sailing team did not finish as

well as they had hoped last
weekend. The team placed se-
venth of ten teams in the
Dinghy Championships held
here at the Lake Norman Yacht
Club.

The seventh-place finish put
the Cats seventh overall of the
fifteen schools in the South
Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing
Association for the spring sea-
son.

The top finisher, Old Dom-
inion University, now qualifies
for the National Championship
in June at Annapolis, Mary-
land. Davidson qualifies for the
Tulane Invitational Regatta at
New Orleans next fall.

As hosts of the regatta last
weekend, the entire team was
kept busy with organizational
responsibilities as well.

were freshman Jim Mashburn

Karis, Gary

This year has been a fairly
good one for the rifle team,
although they lost valuable
first-team shooter George Hat-
field in December and Coach
Staff Sergeant Ransom Cooper
at the end of March. Under the

~ direction of Sergeant Major Bob

Smith, the team finished the
season successfully, with a final
28-12 record.

Maranda Mowbray, Stuart
Baskin and Kathleen Huff, Eric
Sanner and Margot Pearce all
sailed.

Although Davidson finished
inconsistently, individual team
members gained valuable exper-

ience for next year’s season. '

Only Karis, Baskin and Mow-
bray will not be returning next
year.

Two weekends ago, Davidson
had participated in an adven-
turous University of Virginia
Regatta at Lake Monticello.

Nearly all competitors cap-

sized at least once during the re-
gatta. Conditions were treach-
erous to the point of fright. The
wind, blowing up to 25 miles an
hour, often changed force by ten
miles per hour and direction by
20 degrees within a few seconds.

The last regatta for the
spring season is the Women’s
Championship this weekend in
Charleston. Two teams will
represent Davidson in the meet.
Junior Kathy Bell and Fresh-
man Meg McArn will sail in one
fleet, and freshman Margot
Pearce and Kathleen Huff in the
other. “

Doubles highlight Cats baseball

By STEVE SOUD
Staff Writer

The Magical Mystery Tour of the
sometimes magical but more often
mystical Davidson baseball team con-
tinued across the last few weeks.

The latest series started as the team
split with the Citadel. Davidson took the
first game in extra innings when senior
Jeff Ray singled in a run from third to
break a 3-3 deadlock. The second game
was tied 3-3 in the ninth inning as well,
and with a man on third, two our, and a
slow grounder to Davidson pitcher
junior Rusty Colechia, the game seemed
destined for extra innings. Colechia
overthres first though, and the Bulldogs
took the 4-3 win.

A little bit of the Wildcat magic
showed up against Wingate. Although
the Cats. got bombed 12-4, junior Allen
Griffin did a little bombing of his own.
After being robbed of a double on his
first trip to the plate, Griffen rattled off
four consecutives doubles. He would
have joined the NCAA record books with
a few others for most consecutive
doubles, but a new record of five was set
last week.

The mystery team was again fielded
against Duke. Although the Cats ex-

ploded for a six-run top of the first, the

pitching staff gave up a seven-run
bottom half of the inning that included a
grand slam by the Blue Devils. Duke

went on to win, 13-12.

Friday the team took a twin bill from a
less-than-average Furman team, 10-4,
5-4. In the second game the magic
continued as freshman Scott Redding
pulled a win out of a hat when the team
scored four runs in the ninth to give
them a 5-4 win.

Tuesday the team walloped Pfeiffer
13-6 as sophomore Bobby Barnes pitch-
ed eight innings of shutour ball after the
starter was touched for six. Batting
magic was shining as the team hit the
ball harder than it has in any other game
this year. All but one of the starters got
at least one hit.

Eddie Haskell has set a school record
of 14 doubles, but Griffin is only two shy
of that mark. Griffin also set a new
school record of 48 for most hits in a
season. ,

With almost magical hitting like that,
the team’s problem is no mystery. The
Wildcat team earned run average is an
anemic 6.07, while the opponent’s ERA
stands at 5.11. Worst of all, however,
the Wildcat pitching staff has served up
42 homeruns, whereas their opponents
have given up only 11. Overall, the team
is behind the opposition in every
offensive category except doubles.

If. the pitching comes around, the
team should be able to close its overall
18-22 record toward the .500 mark.
