the begin- According to the

ning of the

year, upon the repeated encouragement
of my two wise hall counselors, I went
to my Red Book and read all 10 pages ‘of
the Alcohol Policy, pages 24 to 33.

Upon completion of my assign-
ment, I read it again. And tonight, I read
itagain, I’m still not quite sure what I,
an 18-year-old college student, am al-
lowed to do.

Section VII of the Code of Re-
sponsibility states: “Davidson College,
as an institution, expects to operate in
accordance with the laws of the State of
North Carolina with regard to the pos-
session and consumption of alcoholic
beverages by anyone under twenty-one
years of age which is forbidden by the
state of North Carolina. The use, sale,
possession of alcoholic beverages on
the Davidson campus is subject to this
law.”

Code of Responsibility,
I am underage and therefore am not
allowed to buy, drink, or possess any
alcohol. And since objective No. | of
the Davidson College Alcohol Policy
is to “encourage students through edu-
cation and the issuing of alcohol cita-
tions to obey the laws of North Caro-.
lina regarding the consumption of al-
cohol,” I might as well forget drinking
until I am of age, right?

Under Section III of the Alcohol
Policy, I find that alcoholic beverages
may be consumed in private rooms
within residence halls. _Now, since
obviously I didn’t buy the alcohol since
I'm underage and no one else would
buy it for me since that’s illegal and
we're all under the Honor Code, where
would this alcohol come from? Last I
checked, making my own alcohol also
was illegal.

And so I read on.

Under Section IV of the policy, I
learn that since I can’t drink to begin
with, I also can’t drink in public areas,
on my hall, or at a party. Also, I am
responsible for my own conduct while
in my room, and I should shut my door
if alcohol is present since I can neither
buy nor possess it.

Somehow, I don’t think my par-

I can drink in my room. At the state-
supported University of North Carolina

brief but very clear: If you’re not 21,

Alcohol policy confusion: what are the limit

So here’s my question: if Davidson
operates under North Carolina law,
which forbids individuals under the age
of 21 to purchase, consume, or possess
alcohol, why is it necessary to include
10 pages of often contradictory infor-
mation?

While I am not so
naive to presume that

erful waves of the web, I looked into
alcohol policies in North Carolina law
and on other North Carolina college
campuses.

North Carolina law states that it is
illegal for persons under the age of 21 to
purchase, consume, or possess alcohol.
As far as I understand the statute, the
only variation that exists applies to un-

Their policy is also concise, about a
page long, and wholly consistent with
North Carolina state law.

Duke University’s policy, although
alittle longer than the others, also stands
behind the governing laws of the North
Carolina General Statutes. Itis the only
school of the three, however, that men-

Well, let me tell you that this walk

not sweet. It has, in fact, over the last

The latest episode happened about .

three weeks ago. I’m giving a really big
tour and we are crossing from Admis-

Now, granted, I’m supposed to look
nice when giving tours and so I am
wearing a skirt which is, you know,
short. But I still wasn’t prepared for the

a big ego trip about how cute I am (trust
me). It doesn’t matter what you look
like. Even when I’m decked out in
sweatpants and a fleece, taking a walk
with my friends, we get honks and yells.
Obviously, it doesn’t help that I’m usu-
ally booking it with a six foot tall blond
chic, but, seriously, give me a break.

inclination to partake in such activity or
the urge suddenly strikes you someday,
just remember three things: get a life,
shut-up, and keep your eyes on the.
