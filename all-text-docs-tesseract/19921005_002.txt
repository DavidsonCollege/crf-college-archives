minute concerts in the morning
and at lunchtime. The music in-
cludes the New Hampshire hymn,
and the school alma mater, which
is written to the Christian music,
“Lead on, Oh King Eternal.”

Recently the concerts were
moved from 8:00 a.m. to 7:45
a.m. because professors said the
‘music interfered with early
classes. The noon concert was
moved from 12 to 12:30 p.m.

The complaints began with
the change of schedule, says a
school spokesman.

University officials are re-
viewing the complaints. In the
meantime, the bells will remain
silent for the first time in 40 years.

Low Grades

Linked to Heavy Drinkers
WASHINGTON (CPS) -College
students with low grades con-
sume an average of 11 alcoholic
drinks a week, three times the
amount that honor roll students
do, Say researchers from two uni-
versities.

The Study, based ona survey
of 56,000 students on 78 cam-
pusesduringthe 1989 school year,
also found that students at smaller
schools are drinking more than at
larger schools, and that male stu-
dents are more likely than women
to go on drinking binges.

Students who were getting
D’s and F’s were averaging 10.8

hol, as expected, is the drug of
choice: 86 percent of respon-
dents said they used it in the last
year, and 45 percent said they
drink on a weekly or more fre-
quent basis.

Twenty-seven percentof stu-
dents said they smoked pot in the
past year, and 6.1 percent said
they used cocaine.

Other drugs reported oncam-

pus included steroids, opiates, .

hallucinogens, amphetamines,
sedatives, and inhalants.

The most significant result
is the link between alcohol and
grades, say, officials.

Earned Degrees

Could Reach Record
WASHINGTON (CPS) -
number of students receiving de-
grees at colleges and universities
could reach an all-time high in
most catagories in the 1992-93
school year, the Department of
Education said.

At least 490,000 associate
degrees are expected to be con-
ferred this year. The estimates, in
the department’s annual back-to-
school forecast, include:
bachelor’s, 1.13 million;
master’s, 345,000; and doctor-
ates, 41,000. :

About 75,000 degrees will
be awarded to students in medi-
cine, theology. and law schools,
the department estimated.

Our Past Relived

Davidson history provides a
window to the past, lots of trivia,
and an incredibly rich tradition,
some of which we can be proud of,
and other parts which may be em-
barrassing . Yet our past provides

--us-something- much more impor-

tant to the College, and to the
Davidsoninan institutions and in-
dividuals of both today and tomor-
row.

Our history gives us an inti-
mate understanding of today’s is-
sues, and consequently of
tomorrow’s possibilities. Today’s
situationis the resultof yesterday’s
actions and yesterday’s situation,
so to really understand the here
and now we must look back and
see what precipitated the problem.
Otherwise, we can easily forget
and repeat the problems we meant
to solve.

We find the most pertinent
example of arecurring problem in
the social life of Davidson, espe-
cially Patterson Court. Like the
students of every year since 1836,
we complain of a lack of viable
social alternatives (although back
then they called it ‘boredom’). Just
like the days before 1971 when
alcohol became available on cam-
pus, we have concerns about un-
regulated alcohol consumption in
private areas like dorm rooms or
off-campus.

Today, like many times since
the relatively undisciplined days
of the 1840s, the faculty has tried
to set down new rules and regula-
tions to control student abuses and
behaviors without providing in-
centives and rewards for good be-
havior. Most importantly, the fra-
ternities of Davidson have fallen

into the same rut they have been
stuck in since the sixties, that being
a cycle of reaction to college ef-.
forts to solve real or perceived
problems in Davidson’s social fab-
Tic.

Back inthe 1960s, fraternities
came under increasing fire forrush
and pledging practices and for their
social exclusion of a student mi-
nority. Their parties were closed,
usually off-campus, and truly the
dominant (if not the only) social
opportunity on campus. The Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC) sponsored
the big weekends like Mid-winters
for all students, but that basically
consisted of a big-name concert in
the early evening. Independents
had little to doat an 85% greek all-
male school.

Several times during the de-
cade the administration gnd fac-
ulty tried to develop alternative
social affiliations for these few in-
dependents, but as time went on,
they realized theirclubs could sim-
ply not compete with fraternities.

In the eyes of some faculty
and administrators, a fundamental
change had to take place, allowing
for “total affiliation” in the words
of a 1967 Davidsonian article. By
1971, fraternities were forced by
the College to allow entrance to
anyone who wanted membership.
Consequently, of the twelve na-
tional fraternities, five closed, two

moved off-campus, and a scant
four remained. Interestingly, no
incentives were ever given to those
chapters who gave social opportu-
nities to independents. Davidson
offered nothing except forcedcom-.
promise. .

But the moral of this story lies
in how the fraternities allowed
themselves to actually get in this
fix. When the Trustees reviewed
self-selection, they asked the fra-
ternities to give their opinions to
the review committee. According
to Dean of Students Will Terry, the
chair, and SAE, literally begged
that they come and defend them-
selves. No one ever stepped for-
ward, and with every attempt at
compromise the Truste¢s saw only
an arrogant, self-assured set of re-

actionaries unwilling to even an

attempt at change. For example,
when the faculty, in 1965, banned
pledging for the following year,
the students created “a riot” in the
words of President D. Grier Mar-

-tin, Such actions, rather than mov-

ing the Trustees to the student’s
side, moved them to the reproaches
mentioned earlier.

Today we still suffer from the
same reactionary behavior on the
part of the student body, but this
time not just fraternity men. How-
ever, since fratemities already have
