SAEs Are Moving To
New Boarding House

Members of Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon fraternity wil! begin moving
furniture and equipment into their
new boarding house tomorrow.

The fraternity is leaving their
present location on the Concord
Road and setting up quarters in
the right side of the Old North
Carolina Medical College, which is
located between the Infirmary and
Main Street.

The new house has been pre-
viously used by the college as a
dormitory and more recently as
apartments for faculty members’
families.

The change came as a result of
cramped eating conditions {n the
present SAE house. Boarding
house officials feel that the new
house will provide greater dining
space and better quarters for a
dietician.

In addition to a dining room and
a kitchen, there will be a comfort-
able reception room, rooms suit-
able for several members of the
fraternity, and a second floor
apartment for the dietician, includ-
ing living room, bedroom, apd
bath.

Tommy Humphries, coordinator
of moving activities, expects to
complete the job within a week us-
ing fraternity labor. Plans have
been made to begin transferring
furniture for the reception room
and. students’ upstairs rooms to-
morrow. Kitchen and dining room
equipment will be moved next
weekend.

Transactions on the new house
were made through a local real
estate agent and the owner of the
building, Dr. Douglas of Charlotte,
who is a Davidson aluninus.

The present boarding house has
been occupied by the SAE’s for
about nine years.

| into graduate studies before grad-

uation. It is expected, for the pres
ent at least, to affect only a small

| number of students.

Beginning with the Sophomore
class. Harvard students of superior
achievements may be given special
freedom to do advanced study or
research. This will apply to stu-
dents who have done unusually
well in their first two years of
college. Such students will be per-
mitted to substitute for some col-
lege credits either studies in Har-
vard’s Graduate School of Arts and
Sciences or special research under
the guidance of a faculty tutor.
This, it is pointed out. will allow
students “to pursue informally
work of a broad or specialized
character which is of especial in-
terest to them.”

For the transition. from second-
ary schoo! to college, the Program
offers. two additional possibilities
which will open to students enter-
ing Harvard College in the fall of
1955:

1, Students of superior achieve-
ment and maturity who have com-
pleted the elevénth grade of sec-
ondary school may be admitted to
Harvard College. Ordinarily, stu-
dents enter college after the
twelfth grade of secondary school.

2. After completing his twelfth
year of-secondary school work, a
student may apply for Sophomore
standing in Harvard College. To
do this, a student will have to qual-
ify foy Advancement—Placement
in three or more college courses
in the fields of Biology, Chemistry,
English. History. Language, Mathe-
matics and Physics.

Advanced placement will be de-

termined by special tests and by
study of the student’s secondary
school record. The objective is “to
place entering students in the most
advanced courses for which they
are qualified.”

When superior achievement in
secondary school has given a stu-
dent a graso of one or two of the
general areas of learning—Natural
Science, Social Science, Humani-
ties—he may be permitted to omit
one or two of the introductory
courses in Harvard’s General Edu-
cation Program, and take advanced
courses instead. ‘

The Program will be directed by
a Committee on Special Standing,
consisting of Dean of the Faculty
McGeorge Bundy, as Chairman,
Dean of Admissions Wilbur Ben-
der, Dean of Students Delmar
Leighton, Dean of Freshmen F.
Skiddy von Stade, and five mém-
bers of the faculty to be appoint-
ed by President Nathan M. Pusey.

Talks and panel discussions are

Edmond, Okla. (LP.}—A survey
taken among approximately 300
Central State College students con-
cerning examinations, teachers, ab-
sences, and various other questions
confronting students here, by a
faculty study committee, reveals
the following facts:

Seventy per cent of those ques-
tioned thought that at least 3 to 9
tests should be given duriig a
semester before a semester grade
was given. Fifty-seven per cent
thought that from 4 to 9 or even
more tests should be averaged to-
gether to estimate a final grade.
Sixty-nine students thought that
“pop” quizzes should be given
while 272 disagreed.

Two hundred and eighteen stu-
dents considered true-false tests
were not adequate type tests to
measure the knowledge of a sub-
ject, yet 69 students thought they
were quite adequate. One hundred
and ninety-one students felt that
tests frequently given had been

Many students stated that they
have the tendency of putting their
studies off until the last minute
and if only one test is given, this
can be very harmful to a student’s
grade. The survey seemed to re-
veal that if the instructors would
give more tests the students would
study for each. individual test and
thus keep his studies up-to-date.

NILES ANNOUNCES
LAW SCHOLARSHIP

Dean Russell D. Niles of the New

York University School of Law to-|

day (Sunday, October 31) invited
outstanding college seniors
throughout the country to apply
for the School’s $6,600 Root-Tilden
Scholarships.

Applications for 1955 must be
completed by February 15, Dean
Niles said in his announcement.
Final selections will be made late
in March.

The Root-Tilden program, de-
signed to help develop potential
leaders in public affairs, was in-
augurated at NYU four years ago
and at present has 53 young men
under training for the legal pro-
fession. Made financially possible
by an anonymous donor, the schol-
larships are named for two NYU
School of Law graduates renowned
in American legal history—Elihu
Root (1867) and Samuel J. Tilden
(1841).

In the tradition of the men for
whom they are named, Root-Til-
den Scholarships are awarded on
the basis of superior academic rec-
ord, potential capacity for unself-
ish public leadership, and active
participation in extracurricular col-
lege life.

“A Root-Tilden Scholar will
study for his bachelor of laws de-

ee at NYU's $5,000,000 Law Cen-’

ter Building under a distinguish-
ed faculty of experts,” he stated.
"Individualized instruction in ad-
vanced studies allied to the law
will give him the best opportunity
to develop his public leadership
potential and to succeed at bench
and bar.

“In addition, he will participate
in a series of special seminars and
informal meetings with some of
this nation’s prominent lawyers
and judges to equip him practical-
ly as well as academically with a
working knowledge of the law,
public affairs, and opportunities
for specialized public service.”

A candidate must be at least 20
years of age, but not more than 26,
when his law training begins, and
he must be an unmarried male citi-
zen of the’ United States.

Each of the scholarships carries
an annual stipend of $2,200 to cov-
er tuition, books, and living ex-
penses. Although the award is
made initially for one year, it is
renewed for the second and third
years when the student maintdins
a high standard in legal and gen-
eral scholarship.

College seniors who wish to be
considered for the Root-Tilden
Scholarships should apply imme-
diately to: Dean of the School of
Law, New York University Law
Center, New York 3, New York.
