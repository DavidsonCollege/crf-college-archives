ALCOHOL POLICY

One year ago, The Davidsonian reprinted a letter from Dr. Kuykendal to the College, in which he stated his intention to appoint the Select Committee on intoler-
ance. Indirectly, this committee's influence led the effort to re-write the College's Alcohol Policy as stated in the Code of Responsibility. The Davidsonian now
takes an in depth look at the effects, the effectiveness, and the perceptions of the revised policy.

After a Semester,
Policy Receives
Mixed Reviews

By Leigh Rawdon

Beginning the fall of 1992, a
new alcohol policy took effect on
the Davidson campus. The main
objective of the policy aimed “to
uphold the laws of North Carolina
in regard to the consumption of
alcohol, namely that only those
twenty one years of age and older
may consume alcohol on the
Davidson campus.” Other objec-
tives sought to promote respon-
sible drinking and to provide edu-
cation.
Lack of Respect

The new alcohol policy has
been in effect for more than a se-

anew monitor system and student
determined punishments for cer-
tain violations,

Junior Julie Petty, PCC Presi-
dent, notes that, “students don’t
feel they had a part in creating or
maintaining the policy so they don’t
respect it.” She believes that the
policy has accomplished some of
its goals but that the tension cre-
ated as a result has led many
Davidson students to stay off the
court.

Unnecessary Monitors

on risk management rather than
the one cup rule. Petty stated that

“I sense a tremendous anti-
Davidson fecling on campus in
general due to the new policy,”
observes sophomore Anna
Watkins. “More pcople leave
Davidson to go to the Pub or
Backstreet or to other colleges.”

“The most significant change
at this year’s parties is the lack of
respect for the new alcohol policy,”
comments senior Cabe Loring. At
age twenty-two, Loring is not di-

rectly affected by the policy but he
understands the difficulties of his
underage friends.

The Patterson Court Council
is proposing that the policy be-
come more self-regulating in an
attempt to curb the tension be-
tween the students and administra-
tors. Specific suggestions include

to watch for overly inebriated
people, and to help in case of an
emergency.” Only one school

- employed alcohol monitor would

be needed to supervise IDing and
beer consumption.
“At the beginning the moni-

tors made me feel uncomfortable ©

because their responsibilites
seemed inconsistent,” says sopho-
more John Murchison who agrees
that monitors should serve as gen-
eral safety monitors.
Weekday Party Limits

Petty also emphasized the un-
necessary time limitations on par-
ties. “Parties are a good outlet on
weekdays for a break from study-
ing; students should be respon-

Parties like this at Warner Hall in January seem to defy the
original objectives of the current alcohol policy.

Trustee Comments
on the Current Policy

By Alice Felmlee
College is a time of personal
growth and freedom; yct while the
rules of “Mom and Dad’s house”
no longer apply, the laws of
Davidson College and the. state of

‘North Carolina do. This includes

the consumption of alcohol.

‘Last April, the Board of Trust-
ecs with advice from the Davidson
faculty composed a new alcohol
policy with its purpose being, “to
uphold the laws of North Carolina
in regard to the consumption of
alcohol, namely that only those
twenty-one years of age and older
may consume alcohol on the
Davidson campus.”

According to Trustee Dr. Bill
Wood, “the Board had always been
concerned about alcohol abuse —
not so much the drinkers but the
total abuse. It simply came to the
point where the college was out of
compliance with the laws of the
State.”

._ Init’sattempttocreate amore-
manageable policy the Board of
Trustees altered life on Patterson
Court. As the first parties of the
new school year began in late Au-
gust, the new policy with its one-
cup, ban on alcoholic punch, and
limited week day party rules came

into effect.

This April the Board of Trust-
ees will convene for its spring ses-
sion. At the top of its agenda will
be the assessment of the new alco-
hol policy. Because the policy was
initially implemented on a year
long trial basis, students may sce
further changes.
~ When recently assessing the
policy, Dr. Wood, Head of the
Committee on Campus and Reli-
gious Life noted, “the use of alco-
hol has not diminished but has
moved to different places; how-
ever, racial problems and intoler-
ance traced back to alcohol abuse
have subsided.”

Meeting at Davidson only
three times a year, the Board of
Trustecs has little time to sense the
general feeling of campus. Right
now they are measuring the suc-
cess of the alcohol policy. in an
indirect way by relying on thecom-
ments and observations of the
-CCRL and faculty.

The alcohol policy is an issue
which seems to arouse the whole
campus and Dr. Wood pointed out,
“Ttisnecessary forstudents to jump
into it by letting their feelings be
known and expressing their own
perceptions.” '

Independent
Social Life
Changed Little’
by Policy |

By Christopher Torres

What has the new alcohol
policy at Davidson meant for Inde-
pendent drinkers? Has it really
made the weekends more unpleas- |
ant for students who don’t belong
to fraternitics or eating houses? In
short, has the new policy changed
the way Independents drink? -

Before I begin, I wish to make
an important point.. As an Inde-
pendent and an individual, I can
offer my drinking experiences un-
der the new system as an example.
I cannot honestly speak for every-
one unaffiliated with a house.

The new alcohol policy has
truly had no effect on. the way I
drink. Surprising? Itshouldn’tbe.
After all, I have always done my
serious drinking in my room, the
one location on campus the school
grudgingly sanctions. Thus,
Davidson’s administration had
granted me my own status quo.

Four perhaps? Not quite my speed.
the Back Street Cafe, though re-
freshing, getstired, and there’ sstill
the problem of being underage.
Charlotte offers a better scene, but
it’s twenty miles away. Besides,
driving in Charlotte is an experi-
ence worth avoiding, especially
after drinking.. As you can sce,
bars and clubs are expensive, dis-
tant,-and often off limits to those
under twenty one. Fake I.D.s are
handy but risky. And, in my case,
a fake I.D. would be completely
useless (last year, one of Comelius’
finest pulled me over suspecting I
was an underage driver); I wasina
moving car! Think of whata door-
man or a bartender would say.
Therefore, to drink, I am often
limited to the campus.

Campus Comments. ..What role does alcohol play in your life at Davidson?

“Because of varsity tennis and
economics I find very little time
to go out but I think that for other
people who don’t have their pri-
orities straight the emphasis on
alcohol is extremely out of hand.”
—Jenn Beam, ‘94

“Alcohol is not to high on my list
of priorities but it doesn’t play a
lesser role than it did last year.”
—Kamil Shah, '95

“T think alcohol here is much more
social-oriented. It’s not necessary
but it just makes things more fun.”
—Beth Lindsay, '96

“Alcohol doesn’t really play any
huge role in my life. I still enjoy
going out but! don’tdrink around
people that I don’t know. I’d
rather be with a close group of
friends.”

--Claudine Abernathy, '96

“Last year alcohol was much more
of an escape — to go get drunk
This year its a social extra, not
necessity. SinceI’m notthat big of
adrinker the alcohol policy doesn’
bother me at all.”

—Will Lazenby, '95
