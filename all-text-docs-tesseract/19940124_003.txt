Duke endows
$725,000 for
scholarships,
VAG, and more

By Carrie Blackburn
This year, Davidson College
received $725,000 from the Duke
Endowment which will help off-
set the costs of numerous projects.
The endowment, established
in 1924 by James Buchanan Duke,
has funded projects such as schol-
arships, trips abroad, the Medical

Humanities Program and the con-

struction of the Visual Arts Center.

Every September, the college
proposes different projects to the
Duke Endowment which exam-
ines them and then allocates fund-
ing.

For instance, the Duke money
benefits the recently implemented
James B. Duke scholarship. This
merit award provides $f0,000 an-
nually to two incoming freshmen.

The Duke Endowment also
stands as the single largest con-
tributor to the Campaign for
Davidson. Without this yearly
grant, the college would have a
difficult time funding many en-
deavors.

Director of Development
James McCarthy explains,
“Davidson is really fortunate and
it is really extraordinary. We can
do many things each year which
we couldn’t without it.”

James Buchanan Duke, whose
name adorns both a university and
a power company, started this en-
dowment which stands as one of
the nation’s largest private foun-
dations. In addition to aiding
Davidson, Duke, Furman and
Johnson C, Smith universities, the
organization also assists hospitals
and children’s homes in the Caro-

_ linas.

McCarthy continues, “it helps
set Davidson apart from other in-
stitutions, and I don’t think
Davidson would be quite the school
it is without this endowment.”

President, college discuss “whole lives of students”

‘By Beth Lindsay
Davidson faculty, staff, and
students convened in the Guest
House on January 18 to discuss the
issue of theology for campus min-
istry at a one day retreat initiated

by President Kuykendall.

- Kuykendall’s inspiration for
this retreat came from the sermon
preached by Dean Terry at the or-
dination service of Davidson’s cur-
rent chaplain Rob Spach last fall.
In his sermon, Dean Terry pointed
out that we are “all called to be
ministers in one way or another.”

During discussion, faculty
members vocalized their concern

cee

for the “whole lives of the stu-
dents” at Davidson. Professors
pointed out that the young people
of the sixties gained a great deal of
freedom for youth which they had
not had before. Many felt that this
valuable freedom was, however,
accompanied by a void in roots,
heritage, and tradition.

This lack of tradition, profes-
sors argued, can be further aggra-
vated by the questioning and test-
ing of faith with which students are
bombarded in the classrooms here
at Davidson, especially in courses
in religion and the humanities.
Those present at the retreat:

expressed their desire to discuss
these issues with which students
are grappling on a personal level.
Davidson’s small size, one of its
trademarks, gives faculty and stu-
dents this opportunity.

The ‘group strongly encour-
ages students to take advantage of
the opportunity to eat lunch with
faculty members at the Commons.
The Office of Academic Affairs
sponsors a program allowing pro-
fessors to eat one meal per week at
the Commons provided that they
are with a student. Small discus-
sion groups in freshman dorms, in
which students can discuss freely

dent working at the front desk can
oversee the weight room while
performing regular duties. The
downstairs weight room, will now
be open only to varsity athletes.
One of the new machines in
Baker will incorporate the effect
of free weights. Those lifters who
wish to use the heavier weights
may.do so Monday-Friday from 2
p.m. until 6 p.m. in the weight
room at the football stadium.
Baker will also offer pick-up
basketball every day. In the past,
students have been unable to use
the indoor courts during and after
varsity basketball games because
of the location of bleachers on ei-
ther side of Belk Arena. Johnston
Gym will now be open for pick-up

games during these times.

With these opportunities of-
fered by the administration comes
student responsibility to take ad-
vantage of them. After working
for two years to resolve these con-
cerns, Rudell says that “with a bet-
ter facility, there is pressure on the
students to show that they will not
take it for granted.”

Price stresses that the athletic
staff “wants.to accommodate ‘the
students” and encourages anyone
with questions or recommenda-
tions to place a card in the sugges-
tion box at the front desk in Baker.

These changes will be reevalu-
ated at the end of the semester in
order to determine if they should
be continued.

their ideas with people such as
chaplain Rob Spach or faculty
members, were proposed as an-
other way of encouraging students
during their personal-growth:

Spach strongly emphasized
that a large part of his role as chap-
lain is “to promote liturgical ac-
tivities on campus without com-
promising the college’s proclaimed
Christianity.” He encourages all
students to participate in the events
sponsored by the chaplain’s office
as they deal with the complex is-
sues found both in the classroom
and in campus life.

Self-Selection

Champagne, beer, naked men,
sick and often incoherent people
are the things that come to mind
when one thinks of self-selection
night. This year was no different.

Freshmen were welcomed into
their selected fraternities and eat-
ing houses on Friday, January 21.
Although the men in the class of
’97 made their decisions last se-
mester, women did not have to

_ decide until Wednesday. Final lists

were posted Friday morning.
According to Patterson Court
President Julie Petty, 75% of the
women self selected, which was
more than last year. However,
only 53% of the men decided to

_ pledge a fraternity, less than last

year’s class of freshmen.

As intended, women were di-
vided evenly among eating houses:
48 in Connor, 49 in Rusk, and 47 in
Warner Hall. Petty commented
that most of the women received
their first choice; however, 20 re-
ceived their second choice. All of
the clusters were kept together as
promised in the new system.

KAreceived the largest pledge
class of the fraternities with 27
men, according to Petty. The other
numbers include: Kappa Sig, 26;
Sig Ep, 23; Phi Delt, 22; PiKA, 21;
FIJI, 9; and SAE, 8.

One freshman woman, who
self-selected Warner Hall, said, “I
had a really good time, but I don’t
really remember much.”
