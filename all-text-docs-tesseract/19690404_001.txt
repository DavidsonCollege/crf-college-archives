Curfews: Still Stalled

New curfew rules — or jack of them — appear
to remain stalled in the Dean’s Council, along with
whatever other rule revisions that group. plans. Ai-

though the dean of students was sick th

week and

other numbers of the Dean’s Council refused to com-
ment on the standing of the revisions, the president's
office said no report on the rules had been received.

The dean said earlier all rules require the presi-
dent’s approval, so rule changes still remain at least

that far away.

ROTC: Either Way

The question of voluntary basic ROTC seems to
be in the balance for now. Alfhough the faculty did
vote down a resolution calling for voluntary status,

it required its Educational Polic
a proposal back on the subjec

Committee to bring
before the trustees

meet May 9. The sentiment was clear: the faculty
wants voluntary ROTC. But there was much doubt

about the road to follow.

On the student side, opinion is divided. The EPC
has twice sent the student proposal back to the stu-
dents, asking for more information. But students,
like faculty, are not quite sure what the right road is.

SGA President Peter Hobbie looks toward the
trustee meeting as “the real watershed. It’s at this
point that you'll sit back and reevaluate how things
are going. You've got to give people a chance to do

their job.”

For ROTC, it all depends on the next week or so.

Cars And Scholarships: After April 15

In order for scholraship students to have cars,
the group that has to consent is the Committee
on Admissions and Financial Aid, which is snowed
under in wrapping up the admissions for the Class of
’73 and getting out scholarship applications. So it will
not be until things slow a bit after April 15, the ad-
missions deadline, that the committee can look at

the matter.

“The matter” is a comprehensive report prepared
by a student committee and approved by the Senate
early this term. The report was termed by Peter
Hobbie as ‘‘probably one of the best examples of what
really good work in student government means.”

FACULTY TO INTEGRATE

NUMBER TWENTY ONE

President Defends Compulsory ROTC

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Editor-In-Chief
Compulsory basic ROTC
drew backing from President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. this
week in a press conference.

Although he said the ROTC
issue “is not one that is
vital to Davidson College as
an educational institution.”
he defended the two-year re-
quirement as desirable in
itself and necessary to the
maintenance of the option
of advanced ROTC.

The president also said he
favored placing recent grad-
uates on -the Board of Trus-
tees: announced that the
ROTC Department would
have a Negro officer teach
ing next term, thus integra.
‘ting the faculty; promised
administrative and possible
financial aid to fraternities
yoing local: and“ indicated
that the probability of self.
scheduled exams was almost
“zero.

“If a student doesn’t go to
advanced ROTC.- the basic
course I think may. weil be
of advantage to him.”’ said
Spencer, ‘“‘first of all ih giv
ing him .some. first-hand
knowledge about the military
in a world where military
power is a reality ... and
where at least at this point
there. is a universal military
obligation.”

“As far as it being com-
pulsory for the first two
years,”' he continued, “if this
is necessary to preserving
that option (to take advanced
ROTC), then I think it’s worth
the price.

“Even if it isn't necessary

Davidson), it doesn’t seem

“As far as it being compulsory for the first two

years, if this is necessary

to preserving that

option (to take advahced ROTC), then I think it’s
worth the price. Even if it isn’t necessary for
preserving a unit, it doesn’t seem to me to be a

to me to be a particularly
onerous or nefarious kind of
requirement.

“We require other things.
We require physical educa
tion. becausé we think that
this has some value. It. is
not part of the academic
curriculum, but we feel it
has some value. s0 we re
quire it.”

The president said placing
recent graduates on the
Board of Trustees was “a
very good thing to do. As a
matter of fact. this is one
of the things I suggested to
Mr. Lingle (Walter L. Lin.
gle Jr.. chairman of the.
Board of Trustees) in our
correspondence. and he was
also sympathetic to this.”

Spencer took essentially no
position on the closing of «ll
faculty meetings to stents.
explaining that the (acuity
constitution was written be-
fore he became president
and he was not famitiar with
reasons for details in it.

But he did say that “it
seems to me legitimate for
organizations like the faculty
of the ‘college? if it wishes,
to have meetings which are
not open.”

On the subject. of integrat-
ing. the college staff. Spencer
said that few positions had
opened up. and that despite
efforts to fit! the positions
with Negro applicants. no
qualified black applicants had
been available.

Faculty integration will be
achieved, however, with a
Negro ROTC officer. who will
teach here next year. Spen-
cer attributed the idea to a
student at Open End last fall.
and said the officer was as-
signed at the college's re.
quest.

But for faculty hiring in
general. the president cited
several difficulties. ‘The
pool of qualified candidates
is.extremely small," he said.

and many colleges are com-.

peting for Negro PhD's.
Also, ‘‘the preference and
question of the feeling of

responsibility on the part of °

that is this: I think there are

today who themselves are

To what do team members
attribute their success?

“Luck” quipped Tim Tim-
mons. “The Arizona game
wasn't nearly as good. We
beat them in all four prac-
tice rounds, so maybe we

weren't up for it as much.”

Before the Colgate game
team members “‘prepared"
themselves by just thinking
about the match.

“That's

The New York team’s fans
dominated the audience, out-
numbering the friends and
relatives of Davidson com-
petitors.

The show itself was nerve-
racking for at least three of
the team members. Notepads
provided for calculations took
the brunt of the tension.

Timmons scribbled “I'm
going to die," time after
time interspersed with what

he described as' ‘little Pros-
testant prayérs.

Robert Bryan tried to calm
Timmons, supplementing
Timmons’ supplications with
his own Anglican prayers
inscribed in Latin.

“Tighten up.’ served Dick
Anderson's purposes as he
filled his pad with 64 inscrip-
tions of his own special in
cantation.

“I doubt if Sam was writ-
ing anything at all." guessed
Timmons, as he acknowledg-
ed Sam Gwynn as the most
steady-nerved member of the
team.

Alternate Bod Reid was im-
portant to the team though
he did not compete, accord.

the other team during the
practice sessions, evaluat-
ing their strengths and weak-
nesses and giving encourage-
ment to his teammates.

“Bob was the single most
useful member of the team,”’
said Anderson.

Television viewers should

Bryan got so nervous in the
Arizona game that he bit

said Timmons.

Team members have a

Voluntary ROTC

Group To Seek

Experts’

By JULE YOUNG
Staff Writer

Visits to several area col-
leges and consultation. with
at least three experts on
campus sociological trends
will be on the agenda of the
President's Commission on
Social Patterns during the
next two months.

The commission, compos
ed of students, faculty mem
bers and trustees, has met
18 times since it was appoint
ed along with the other four
commissions last.
ber. according to C. Shaw
Smith, director of the College
Union and commission chair-
man.

Smith said the commission
plans to present its findings
at the end of this term.

The commission has been
concerning itself with three
principle facets of campus
living. Smith said: dormi
tory life: small group act-
ivity. such as the fraternity
system; and total campus
activity, principally center-
ed in the College Union.

Smith. said he had been
distressed by poor attendance

from fraternity members at-

the commission’s several
open hearings. “I've been
very disappointed that more
fraternity members have
not taken part.’ he said.
He nt'ributed it to fraterrity
members’ apparent . sutis-
faction with the oresent set-

up.

The fraternity issue has
taken up a large part of the
commission's time Smith
said. but it has also been
studying other aspects of
the Davidson social environ-
ment.

He said that the commis
sion is still examining sev-
eral residence hall alterna
tives. ‘However, ‘it's a bit
premature to speculate on
just what the group will re-
commend.” he said. “I do
think, though. that this com-
mission will attempt to en-
‘dorse a social program which
will seem natural rather
than forced.”

Visits to other colleges in
the area will probably in-
clude the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill and
St. Andrews. Smith said the
purpose of these visits
would be to gather ideas.

“And that each entering

Implicit in the referral to
the EPC was a request for
