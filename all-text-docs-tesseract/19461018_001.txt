Col. Grace Announces Plans
For This Year

Lieutenant Colonel William P.
Grace, professor of military science
and tactics at Davidson, revealed
in a recent intereview that the
present adyanced R, O. T. C, course
is now well established, mainly be-
cause of the influx returning
veterans to the campus.

of

This is the first year since 1942-
8 that there has been a four-year
program of military training at Da-
vidson. There are now seventy
men, of which fifty-seven are vet-
erans, enrolled in the course, com-
prising two years of advanced
study. Upon successful comple-
tion ofthe four-year program a
cadet receives a second lieutenant’s
commission in the Officers’ Re-
serve Corps of the United States
Army. While in training the cadet
is furnished all uniforms and equip-
ment needed and in addition re-
ceives twenty dollars monthly pay.
To be eligible for the advanced
course an applicant must be be-
tween the ages of nineteen and
twenty-six. In the pre-war years
the advanced courses were at-
tended only by juniors and seniors,
but a new ruling has permitted the
enrolling of ex-servicemen with at
least one year’s duty, so that the
majority of students enrolled is
now freshmen. The first year ad-
vanced course, or R. O. T. C. 31,
now has fifty-one ‘members who
will attend a summer camp of six
weeks duration next summer, where
they will receive practical training
in the branch of service of their
choice. The final course, or R. O.
T. C. 41, has nineteen members.
Under the revised schedule ad-
vanced students take three hours

Chest To Start
15th Campaign

Community Chest Drive to
Begin Oct. 24

Mecklenburg County’s fifteenth
Community Chest campaign will
be under way on October 24 and
will close on November 5, 1946. The
minimum goal for Mecklenburg for
this year has been set at $280,-
941.94.

Contributions towards the chest
campaign will go to the support
of such worthy projects as the Char-
lotte Day Nursery, both white and
colored divisions, which is bringing
health and happiness to many chil-
dren who otherwise might become
social problems. Part of the funds
raised will go towards Girl Scout
work for the number of Girl Scouts
in the community has doubled in
the past several years. Last year
eight hundred and fifty-two Girl
Scouts benefitted by this program.

The Salvation Army is also a re-
ceiver of the funds raised in the
drive. This organization conducts
four separate programs The Cen-
tral Red Shield club, Temple Corps,
Belmont Community Center, and
North Charlotte Community Cen-
ter. In addition to these, the Sal-
vation Army maintains an emer-
gency home for women and chil-
dren and a transient lodge for men.

Various branches of the Charlotte
Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. also
benefit. This agency’s program,
oldest in service in our community,
speaks for itself. The postwar
period is one that demands of our
young men and women alert minds,
strong bodies and a Christian out-
look..

“Traveler’s Aid is another one of
the many services aided by your
contributions to the campaign. This
agency .functions around the clock,

Land last year assisted 28,064 per-

sons who were lost or in distress
in our community. Thousands of
persons would become serious, cost-
ly problems if it were not for this

agency’s actions.

tract bridge contest for a national
championship cup will be held in

by Foster M. Coffin, director of
Willard Straight Hall, Cornell Uni-
versity, and chairman of the Inter-

cate tournament for undergraduate
pairs, with the, title of National In-
tercollege Champions going to the
winning team. Preliminary rounds

teams representing every section
of the country will be selected
through the mail competition for
face-to-face finals in Chicago on
April 18 and 19.

The*Intercollege Bridge Tourna-
ment Committee, which supports the
event so that there is no cost to
the competing colleges or the play-
ers, is a group of alumni interested
in developing bridge as an intercol-
legiate sport in which men and
women compete on an equal basis.
Vice chairman of the 1947 commit-
tee is Nelson B. Jones, director
of Faunce House, Brown Univer-
sity, and Louis D. Day, Jr., direc-
tor of Houston Hall at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, is treasurer.
Earlier tournaments run bys the
committee have been endorsed by
the Association of Student Unions.

- Official approval.by the autliori-
ties in each participating college is
required before the committee ac-
cepts entries.

“An invitation to enter the 1947
tournament will be sent within the
next few weeks to the dean or a
corresponding authority in, more
than 300 colleges accreditéd by the
Association of American Universi-
ties.

War Destroys ©
Many Books

One of the greatest consequences
of the recent war was the destruc-
tion of the libaries of half the world.
Some were destroyed and damaged
in the fires of battle, others in the
fires of hate and fanaticism. An
organization known as the Amer-
ican Book Center for War Devas-
tated Libraries has been set up in
Washington for the purpose of re
ceiving contributions of books and
sending them to the needed areas.

The total loss from the war has
been numbered — at — 200,000,000
books, China and the Philippines

are the greatest sufferers with a
loss of nearly every book , found
by the enemy. Poland runs a close
second with 70 per cent of her li-
braries destroyed, and then comes
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia who
have lost half their libraries.

The losses have left their great-
est mark on scholars and men of re-

search, Even in areas where li-
braries were not damaged, phy-
sicians, engineers, chemists, and

other experts have been cut off
from American publications. There-
fore, though they might be aware
that great strides have been made
in their fields during the war, they
are isolated from such information.
Important American publications
are needed at once where they can
be put to work by these men.

Among the publi¢ations emphat-
ically requested ate those ‘issued
in the last ten years, scholarly
books which are important contri-
butions to their fields, periodicals
of scholarly importance, and fiction
and nonfiction of distinction. Books
of sciences and technologies are
especially needed.

Materials not needed include
textbooks, light fictiony local in-
terest items, and popular maga-
zines. : |
Please bring any books that you
would like to contribute to the li-
brary as soon as possible, for they
would like to get the books mailed

by the end of next. week. This is
a very worthwhile project, and the
help of everyone is needed.

subject “Being Alive in Christ.”
Having recently visitetl Nain,
Palestine, Reverend Smith opened
his talk by relating the incident
of Jesus’ resurrection of the young
man of that city two thousand years
ago. The subject of his ;
was taken from = Christ’s words,
“Young man, I say unto thee,
arise!” Elaborating on this topic,
Reverend Smith posed the question,
“How can we know that we're
alive?” He went on to give three

grow, feel, and reproduce. We must
be alive to the challenges and op-
portunities arising daily.__Rever-
end Smith brought out that in
order to be a’true Christian, we
should constantly check ourselves
to see that we are, in reality, living
for Christ.

Born in Nickerson, Kansas, in
1887, Reverend Smith has attended
a number of colleges and universi-
ties among which are Northwest-

Set Tickets
Mae Jeffries, president of the
Council, stated that tickets will

go on sale on the campus the first
of next week. Base price of a set
ticket wilk- be $5.00, but due to the’
recently imposed entertainment tax
of 20 per cent set on dances by
the Federal government, it will be
necessary to add this amount on the
base price, bringing the cost of a
set admission to $6.00. Individual
tickets for the formal dance Friday
night will be $4.00 and for the in-
formal one Saturday night, $3.00,
tax included. All admissions will
include dates.
Asks Co-operation

Jeffries. emphasized the impor-
tance of co-operation with the
Council by the student body on the
Homecoming dances. ‘He brought
out the point that this is the first
time in many years that a Pan-
Hellenic Council has felt able—to
bring a nationally known. band to
the campus, but that this year,
with the size of the student body at
an all time high, the council feels
that such a financial venture could
be successfully supported. He said,
however, that if the dances proved
that the student body. could not. pay
for a name band, then the council
would feel obliged to go back to
the old policy of hiring purely. local
orchestras for the other dances this
year. ;

Byrne’s orchestra is a sixteen-
piece organization, with two vocal-
ists to handle the lyrics. In addi-
.tion to the engagements mentioned
‘above, he has also played for many
college dances throughout the coun-
try, including Georgia Tech. Dances
will run from 9 o'clock to 1 o’clock
on Friday night in the Armory, and
from 8 o’clock to 12 o’clock on Sat-
urday night in the Youth Center of

the Armory.
