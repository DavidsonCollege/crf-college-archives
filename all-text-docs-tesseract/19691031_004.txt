To Be Expanded

The YMCA will be able to
expand its program slightly
as a result of the fall drive,
although the expansion will
not be as great as planned,
according to Y
dent Greg Scott.

Scott said that contribu
tions have topped $2600 and
that a balance of $1156 re-
mains from last year. He
expects another $200 to be
raised by a canvass of stu-
dents living off campus and
of those faculty and students
not reached in the initial
drive. Even so, the project-
ed total will fall $1441 short
of the $4100 budget distribut-
ed during the drive.

The activities of the YMCA
are financed solely by
money raised during the
fund drive. No money is al-

vice-presi

lotted from the student acti- °

vity fund.
Scott attributes the success
ofthis year’s campaign to
the work of the 75
students who canvassed stu-
dents and facults

summer fund drive by the
North Mecklenburg YMCA.

In Israel the Johnstons
visited Tel Aviv, Jaifa, Jeru-
salem, Nazireth, Bethlehem
and the Galilean area. They
planned their own tour and
enjoyed doing much of their
sightseeing on foot.

While in Tel Aviv, they
lived in a Jewish hotel, and
while in Jerusalem, an Arab
hotel. This not parti-
cularly surprising since the
Johnstons noticed many
Arabs living and conducting
their own enterprises in sup-
wosedly Jewish controlled re-*
gions, In fact, they discover-
ed that many Arabs today
have the right to vote, and

‘Birth’ Correct,
ku Society Told

“Birth of a Nation’ was
filmed in order to heal the
emnity between North and
South by putting Reconstruc-
tion in historical contex, Dr.
Chalmers G. Davidson told
the Eu Society last Thurs-
day.

Davidson, an expert in lo-
cal and Souther history, at-
tributed altruistic motives to
the film's producer D. W.
Griffith.

The film contains a glorifi-
cation of the Ku Klux Klan
Dayidson said, but the Klan
at the time of Reconstruc-
tion has little in common
with the Klan of today.

According to Davidson,
“Birth of a Nation’’ shows
no racial bias and portrays
the good and bad of both
races.

Known for its sophisticated
cinematic technique, the film
is based on the book ‘The
Klansman” by Thomas Dix-
on. The book lacks the ob-
jectivity of the movie, David-
son said.

The Eumanian Society was
revitalized earlier this month
under the direction of senior

Pat Mullen for the stated
purpose of furthering intel-
lectual and artistic aware-
ness of campus.

Eu is.sponsoring a poetry
reading following the con-
cert Saturday night at 10:15
in Eu Hall. The session is
open to all members of the
college-community.

“It is part of the Society's
effort to further poetic ex-
pression on campus,”’ Eu
president Mullen ‘said. ‘‘Poe-
try is as essential to the soul
as vitamins are to the body.”

According, to Mullen,
membership in Eu is open
to all members of the college
community. ‘Each member
will be responsible for at
least one program," he said.

Mullen said that most of
the program would probably
draw local talent. ‘“‘We will
try to keep within the cam-
pus and only go outside if a
member can arrange it.”
There are no dues to provide
‘the funds for paying visiting
speakers. =

reading is planned for No-

of 1969.

The Davidson Groundling
Society came fully armed
with its sarcasm and esprit

harshly with D. W. Griffith
if his art was found wanting.
The responses were copious,
and there seemed more than
enough material for a rheto-
rical rout, but it soon became
evident that Griffith was car-
rying the day.

As the laughter at Austin
Stoneman in the previous
scene died out, a hushed
silence fell over Love Audi-
torium while the scene at |
Ford's Theatre flickered to
its irresistible conclusion.

And then the movie began.
