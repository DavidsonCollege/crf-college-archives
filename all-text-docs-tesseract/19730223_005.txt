Phillips Clarifies
‘Misleading Quotes’

To the Editor:

I would like to clarify the
rather misleading, and in one
case, incorrect, statements that
I was quoted as having made in
last week's DAVIDSONIAN.

I did not say that | viewed the
new calendar as ‘a slap in the
face to those candidates who
campaigned on a platform of
Senate inaction.”

I stated in the notice which
was posted immediately after
the decision, “This is a victory
for the entire student body.”’
and that is what I meant. I do
not see the new calendar as a
vindication of those who cam-
paigned on a record of the
SGA’s past performance.

It is rather an example of
what the students can dotowards
shaping policy at Davidson.

I also would like to apologize
for any statement I may have
made in regards to this ‘“‘vic-
tory’ being a case of beating
the administration and faculty.
The caption under Dr. Bevan's
picture saying ‘‘My calendar’s
not good enough, huh", set the
negative tone for the entire ar-
ticle, an article which tended to
distort the opinions of the SGA
members who were _ in-
terviewed.

Rather than emphasizing the
defeat of any one faction of the
college community, I would like
to concur with THE DAVID-
SONIAN, editorial of last week
and point out that without the
cooperation of Dr. Bevan and
the Faculty Executive Commit-
tee, the student efforts would
have been in vain.

Blain Butner and I were
allowed to present our case to

GRAY WILSON

the committee, and we were
well received.

As Blain pointed out in his let-
ter last week, we found the
faculty members receptive to
our ideas and concerned about
our interests.

The SGA and the student body
as a whole has a right to be
proud of this achievement in
changing the calendar. We did
not beat anyone, but rather, we
got together and produced a
positive change. Again, I want to
thank all students who in any
way contributed to the calendar
change. and I hope that in the
future we can produce similar
changes toward the betterment
of Davidson College.

Union Board Examines Student Interests

To the Editor:

What does appeal to the
apathetic Davidson student?

Why does he exist?

Where is he when we need
him the most?

Members of the new Union
Board are asking questions like
the above in hopes of coming up
with some new and worthwhile
ideas for the Davidson College
community.

Last Wednesday night, in the
lobby of Belk Dormitory, the
Lemon Squeeze squeezed and
squeezed and squeezed! Not
many students showed up for
this open meeting with the new
Board, indicating to me that
they seem to be very satisfied
with the social life already in
existance.

However. maybe they had a

review on Thursday or someone
came to see them who had just
arrived from Vietnam.

In any case, the student body
doesn't seem to be interested in
what can be done to improve
and pave a new social life on
campus.

The new Union Board wants
to be used as a ‘‘dart board”.

They want to hear the bit-
ching that goes on in the
showers and behind the doors of
smoke filled rooms.

Which would the student body
rather see on stage: Roberta
Flack or Edgar Winter?
Nobody knows because nobody
ever tells the Board what they
want to see!

The calendar was changed
because enough student anger
was stirred up. Students united
behind their new proposal and it
was accepted. Why can't the

same thing happen with getting
a big name band for Spring
Frolics? ;

Talk to the members of the
Board and express to them - not
to the janitor on Fourth East -
about your feelings of im-
proving the system! Spring
Frolics is a lot closer than it
seems.

Are you aware of how long it
takes to sign a contract with a
big name group? A contract
that won't be broken two weeks
before the event? Ask any of the
Board members.

They may not have all the an-
swers, but with enough interest
a lot of questions will get an-
swered.

The members of the new
Board are:

Joe Earle B229

Tom Tornee R415

Bonnie Henesv L409

Tom Bernhardt B 452

Jerry Godbehere W107

Bruce Reichelderfer B201

You know some of the above;
if not, get to know them before
we all end up eating hard boil-
ed eggs for the rest of our lives!

‘Benign Anarchy’ Bows To Police Play

This year a nuisance has sprung up on
the Davidson campus. It's white on the
outside, blue on top, and red on the in-
side.

That's right, the local fuzz are here,
and they seem determined to turn the
campus into a police state.

It was not always this way. Four years
ago, if you came back from a late date
Saturday night gassed out of your mind
doing 55 mph as you turned into the cam-
pus, grazing the tubercular tree with
reflectors growing out of the trunk
(Lamarck), sitting there stoned with a
joint in each ear, a satchel with $100,000
in you lap and a loaded bazooka in the
back seat---then the Davidson police
might stop you to offer directions.

And after finding the corpse in the
trunk they might fine you $12 for illegal

possession.

But those days of benign anarchy are
gone. Now the campus provides a setting
for Adam-12 retakes, and every time you
ski jump the ridiculous speed bumps next
to the laundry, the old vehicular bubble-
gum assails you with that paper diaper of
a citation as though Marlon Brando and
the Wild Ones had come frothing onto the
pavement.

There are times, however, when our
new centurions pose a menace that
leaves a bad taste in the mouth.

Such was the case in point which oc-
curred three weeks ago in a small,
unassuming house on Patterson Court,
once a peaceful community.

The time was 9 a.m. Saturday. Since
the names have been changed to protect

the guilty, let us call our suspect Reid
Moore, since no Davidson student
presently has that name.

Anyway. these modern day Men ol La
Mancha were cruising around the court
that morning when they spotted not one.
not two, but three separate houses which
had been circumnavigated several times
by some vehicles probably stolen, which
had left vicious tread marks in the grass
that would probably take no less than a
week to disappear.

Coming upon a small, yet suspicious
looking MG parked askance in front of
one of the victimized houses. these wily
detective hojohns discovered dried grass
matted onto the tires.

Putting one and nothing together. they
arrived at three hypoth...pihotho. .hyper-
to..three theories. First. the grass on the
car was the same as that grass not there
in the tread marks around the houses.
second, the car had made those tracks:
and third, the culprit was holed up in the
house.

Sgt. Lowrance, having handled touchy
cases involving ‘grass’ before,
suggested a prudent course of action, so
they stormed the nearby fraternity
house.

They would have surprised the guilty
party, except that one Reid Moore was
suffering from a party of another kind.
and in legal terms was catching a little
desperately needed “bunko™ on the
couch.

The accused was startled out of his
alcoholic revery., but still not yet suf-
ficiently cognizant to be surprised over
anything other than his having survived

the night before. He was further unable to
rally to his defense, suffering from an
acute case of cotton-mouth which muted
any attempt to assert his rights as an in-
dividual.

Subsequently having been questioned
to the ample satisfaction of his in-
vestigators (that is, being unable to an-
swer with anything more than a ‘mnnn"’)
he was moved in custody to the police
station while his car was impounded for
evidence (imagine bringing an MG intoa
courtroom).

After the Enforcers of Law had
cogitated sufficiently about such things
as where the plastic covers for their hats
had gotten to, and how poorly that there
Marijuana plant was doing, they in-
formed Mr. Moore, slowing dying of
dehydration and alcohol asphyxia, that
they estimated the damage at $1800 and
would release him on his own recogni-
zance until further notice. wherein his car
would be returned.

Mr. Moore protested that he was
responsible for the tracks only around
one of the houses, noticing in passing that
the tire marks in front of the Pika House
were the width of a large truck.

Confronted with such _ heinous
rationale, the P.D. was all the more
anxious to be rid of him, so they ushered
him out the door.

Epilogue: One week late Mr. Moore's
car was returned and the college fined
him $50 plus a $10 tow charge by a
wrecker which did over $100 damage to

the frame.

The incident you have just witnessed is
true. The tracks are now gone. I have
seen mudslides all over the court, and a
ball game in front of the Jock House that
made the yard look like Jason himself
dragged a plow across it, but never has
there been any serious damage done and
never have the fuzz been encouraged to
interfere with healthy college pranks
that show a lot more ingenuity than
anything housed in Chambers.

It puzzles me why such a situation now
exists which threatens the perennial
good will between town and campus.

Over Midwinters a number of articles
were ripped off or destroyed, as always
is the case on big weekends, but the
stepped up police security was certainly
no deterrent factor.

If coeducation is responsible for the in-
creased policing, then I suggest that the
presence of the girls so far on this cam-
pus eliminates the need for any security.

Davidson is a peaceful campus, for-
tunate that it is free of any major crime.
The only threats to law and order on this
campus so far are students who give out
parking tickets.

If the administration has likewise en-
couraged the local officers to patrol the
campus every minute with several cars,
then I suggest another possible source of
criminal activity on first floor Cham-
bers.

But one way or the other, it’s time for
the student body to be rid of the dubious
protection of the mighty hordes of John
L. Law.
