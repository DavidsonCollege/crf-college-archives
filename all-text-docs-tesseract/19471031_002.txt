I have to say is offered not in the

ut rather in the hope of presenting
some dinprovement that will be to the satis-

Torm

of the college

Daily chapel exercises have long been a
Davidson tradition lauded by - students,
faculty and alumni, A moment's pause dur-
ing busy schedule is refreshing and bene:
ficial; the opportunity of assembling to-
ether as a student group-is worthy-and sat-

isfying.

In order that the faeulty and students
might share in this tradition, the program
schedule was divided into three groups:
1, Monday and Wednesday having been
designated as faculty days; 2. Tuesday and
Thursday as student days; 3. Friday as the
Y.M.C.A. day.

Faeulty day might be further classified
as a serious or thoughtful exercise—being
either religious or secular in its nature. On

these days student participation, both
audience and presidential (i, e. announce-
ments) should be limited. A marked em-

phasis on social decorum would be appro-
priate. Faculty members are due the respect-
ful attention of us all during their discourse.

The definition of loose as given in Web-
_ster’s is as follows: ‘Free; unattached—
said especially of things ordinarily con-

fined.’’ I would describe student day as:

“‘loose.’? At this time faculty participation
should be limited if not abolished. This is a
day of, for and by the students; a day in
which the student body might give vent’ to
their emotions, humor and school spirit; a
day for the promotion of school solidarity.

The Y.M.C.A, day should be*observed in
the spirit in which it is offered—be it re-
ligious, musical or secular,

In order that we might continue the ob-
servance of this important tradition in the
spirit in which it was founded a simple rule
comes to mind, which if followed would im-
mediately solve any problems in connection
with the chapel exercises. This rule has been
called the Golden Rule: ‘‘Whatsoever ye
would that men should do unto you, do ye
even so unto them.”’

Letters to the
Editor...’

Dear Editor:

As the school year opens countless stu-
dents can be seen carrying among their lug-
gage a set of golf clubs which they have
brought to school at considerable trouble and
expense. They are lured by promises of find-
ing a modern and well kept golf course ad-

|

jacent to the college athletic fields. Little do
they realize what small dividends they will
receive from their trouble and expense. The
course is neither modern nor well kept.

As one approaches the first tee (?) he is
bewildered as to which direction to look for
the fairway. To his delight directly in front
of him are countless varieties of weeds inter-
mingled with the local waste. disposal sys-
tem over which he must drive his ball in a
professional manner if he expects to find it
again. If by chance the ball does clear the
aforementioned abyss, the golfer, standing in
knee deep saw-grasss, addresses the ball for
his approach shot. After hitting this shot he
stands by and watches the ball gracefully
drop on the green and then plummet off into
space due to its contact with this concrete:
like surface, After several of these experi-
ences the golfer’s elubs go into the closet not’
to be used again, As the first hole is char-
acteristic of the other eight no further dis-
cription is necessary,

(Editor’s Note: The following letter is from
Dr. Kenneth J. Foreman, until last year Professor
of Bible and Philosophy at Davidson College. In
it he wishes to express appreciation to the donors
of a “going-away” gift for him.) _

Dear Student Body:

When that very handsome suitease ar-
rived, as it chanced on my birthday, and I
discovered where it came from, I wrote to
Mr. Murphy Williams at once to thank him
for his part in it and to inquire to whom I
might write in the student body to express
my thanks. He has just written*me, and says
that no one man can be singled out, that
the summer school student body as a whole
Was responsible and, of course, they have
now dispersed or been absorbed. But he sug-
gested that I might Write The Davidsonian
and it might express my appreciation to the
men for me.

At all events you may tell all who are
interested that the gifts quite overwhelmed
me, and that I shall long use and treasure
it in memory of my many friends in the
Davidson student body. It is a handsome and
useful object in itself, but especially valua-
ble forthe spirit which prompted it. I have
already made use of it, as you may imagine.

We are settled now at home and at work}
and while of course I shall always miss
‘Davidson, still I find the work here chal-
lenging and the community and churches
very friendly.

With best wishes and thanks to you and
all who shared in this generous gift, I am

Sincerely yours,
KENNETH J. FOREMAN.

Dormitories

Congratulations Mrs. Little,
Mr. Jackson and whoever else con-
tributed to the wonderful face-lift-
ing’ our dormitories have received
since last spring. Last year they
were almost.atrocious. This fall we
find what fresh paint, colorful cur-

to

tains and a woman's touch can do
for a-row of drab, dirty, unlovely
old buildings.

In behalf of everyone of us
who live in the dorms let thanks
be given for making our rooms
here look more like our homes.
They’re so much more livable
and attractive now.

It's up to us now to keep them
this way, clean and homelike, Of
course we hope this won't be the
last coat of paint ever to be placed
on these walls, but it can’t be done
every year, if these halls are
not soon to return to their former
state, we must take the responsi-
bility for their care,

While we're saluting dorm re-
formers, a few suggestions respect-
fully offered.
