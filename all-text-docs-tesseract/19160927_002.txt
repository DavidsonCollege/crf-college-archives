PROCRASTINATION.

Perhaps as a thief of time, Proscras-
tination finds more abundant and easier
swag in a college community than any-
where else. “Put off till tomorrow what
you can do today” seems to be the slogan
of our college student. An instance of
this is the Senior, who dallies on beds of
roses until the last month of his college
career and then works himself into a
nervous breakdown before the first of
June. We are all, more or less, victims
of the deadly germ of Procrastination.
Perhaps the basis of this failing is the
innate tendency in mankind toward
hopefulness—hopefulness, in this case,
that something will come, up to relieve
us of our duty.

The most effective remedy which we
have found for this disease is the propo-
sition of the Daily Schedule. Accord-
ing to this plan, the subject takes a lit-
tle time each night and plans the work
for every minute on the following day.
He plans what time he will devote. to
study, what to play, how much time he
will give to reading, how much to
thought and devotion. And thus he has
a working plan. for each day. He fig-
ures out his most effective routine and
if strictly followed. it will , eliminate
most of his dilly-dallying and delav.
The flexibility of the schedule avoids
any danger of making us machine men.
In the questions recently published, the
answers to which determined the rela-
tive efficiency of any man, one question
was, ‘Do you plan each day in ad-
vance?” F. H. S.

Davidson, we believe, is unique in
having eight services every Sunday.

Those who have it in charge should
spell it gym-nay-seum.

One could hardly have Spring fever
this late in the vear, but in many a Fall
of spirits is discernable?

We hope the Lyceum won't be this
year what Tom Finley said it was last
year, all “ly” and no “seum.”

We will be judged in direct propor-
tion to what we do, and in indirect pro-
portion to what we can do.

It is a pity that someone cannot con-
coct a new program for Literary So-
cieties. The present form has become
gray-headed.

Members of the South Carolina Club,
who have been jibed in past years be-
cause of their friend, Blease, can be
spotted at present by their expressions of
relief.

MINISTERIAL BAND
HAS ENJOYABLE “FEED”

On Saturday night the Ministerial
Band held a “feed” in the Commence-
ment Hall. Sixty-nine members were
present, and six tables were crowded
with the good things to eat. Needless
to say they soon disappeared. After the
“eats,” several of the new members of
the band were called on for speeches.
Among these were: Freeman, of Steele
Creek; Roberts, of Wilmington; Sulli-
van, of Atlanta; and Penick, of Ar-
kansas. Some impromptu songs were
rendered by Messrs. Freeman, Daven-
port and Brown, and then the whole
company united in singing the college
songs. The object of this gathering was,
as the president stated, to get the mem-
bears together, and to get acquainted
with the new men. The committee in
charge of this entertainment were Bel-
lingrath, chairman, Cumming and Eikel.

BLUE PENCIL CLUB
HOLDS FIRST MEETING

The first mecting of the year of ‘the
Blue Pencil Club was held last Thurs-
day, September 21, in the hall of the
Beta Theta Pi Fraternity. At this time
Dr. Wharey, of the department of Eng-
lish of the University of Texas, gave a
most ‘instructive and enjoyable talk on
the life and work of Sidney Lanier.

This club has regular monthly meet-
ings, at which time papers on various
subjects or short stories are read, dis-
cussed and criticized. The best essay
written by a club member is submitted
in the Essayists contest conducted by the
chapters of Sigma Upsilon. In 1915
the contest was won by G. W. Gignil-
liat, of the local chapter.

The local membership now includes
S. R. Keesler, Jr.. T. J. Mitchell, W.
Y. Sayad, P. B. Price, 8. T. Hender-
son, S. M. Crisp. Dr. M. G. Fulton,
Dr. J. M. McConnell, and Dr. M. E.
Sentelle.

TMPROVEMENTS BEING
MADE ON GOLF COURSE

Golf has taken a strong hold on the
athletically inclined, and it is hoped that
many new members may be enrolled
this year. The course, tho not perfect,
is good enough to learn on. In prepara-
tion for the season, the greens are rap-
idly being put in order and the fairways
are being mowed.

GOOD PRINTING

CONSISTS OF MORE THAN INK, TYPE & PAPER

While there is nothing mysterious about the process, it requires, among
other things, good judgment, taste, and a desire to keep ahead or above the
average. ‘Ihe goodness of printing is governed by the printer’s equipment
plus his ability to use it. We have a generous supply of both and are con-
“Every Job A Good One" stantly adding to them.

: Our line embraces all kinds and classes of work, but
we prefer to do the better kind. If you desire the
best in any class we can meet your requirements,
and guarantee to please you.
