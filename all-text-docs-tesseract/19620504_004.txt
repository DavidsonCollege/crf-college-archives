BY BILL TROTTER
Davidsonian Fine Arts Critic
It might not be to far off to say that the exhibition
of works by the Bumgardners has been the most excit-

ing a
to see t
Muses.

But
count (there were some smaller
paintings where the identity of
the object painted was uniden
tifiable) there were some twenty
odd owls lining the halls. In fact
there might as well have been
twenty reproductions of the
same painting. The “Ow! Varia-
tions’ were simply not varied
enough. To Mr. Bumgardner’s
credit, let it be said that his
work reflects sincerity and
shows a fine use of color. But

owls”

Art which shows things dif-
ferent from those which our
eyes see daily may have many
virtues to give it value. Among
them might be the exotic quali-
ty that suggests motion, vast-
ness, emotion—or something
that creates some physical re-
sponse in the beholder through
its use of form and color. Of
these items, only the latter was
present in Mr. Bumgardner’s
paintings.

These paintmgs were a
seemingly endless number of
off centered, distended imag-
es -of balloon-breasted pink
“nudes” that resembled semi-
melted ice cream. The owls
themselves were scratched
rather strangely, either on,
beside, behind or superim-
posed on the melted ice
cream blobs. But the dreadful
sameness of the paintings!

They imparted no emotional
suggestions—did not please the
eye with their design, kept their
inner meaning marvelously hid-
den, (so well hidden this re-
viewer is hard-put even to ad-
mit it exists) and left the viewer
with his shoulders in mid-shrug.
Strangely enough, when his
paintings blurred into pure ab-
straction, when his very good
power of color took over and
invested the shapes with its own
meaning, then Mr. Bumgardner's
work seemed worthy of com-
templation. The same thing may
be said of the relatively few
landscapes—they had sweep,
color, real worth. But

Mrs. Bumgardner’s sculp- |
ture might charitably be de-
scribed as “cute”. Her work
was constructed out of very
raw materials—-wooden chess
men, orange crate bottoms,
chest-of-drawer-knobs, etc. But
here, again, an oppressive,
dead, lack of variety—the
same idea was worked and re-
worked until the impression
one got was just a blur of
wooden toys, each trying vain-
ly to assert some importance
it did not possess. Here was
sculpture which neither beau-
tified, outraged, thrilled, or
puzzled very strongly.

To be sure, when one first
entered the gallery, one was
slightly puzzled. But the effect
fore off when, upon close ex-
amination, one found that there
was nothing there to get puz-
zled about. But at least it was
honest art—it did not,
much modern music and art
does, make the viewer feel that
if he only looked long and hard
enough, and tried very hard to
get into the right mood, some
great importance or value would
manifest itself. One hard glance
was sufficient to show most peo-
ple than any long session of con-

templation would be a waste of

time.

Lest it should seem that |

am condemning Bumguard-
ner’s . work,

that they came. It was delight-
ful to hear the violent asser-
tions of opinion and criticisms
being handed back and forth
among the viewers. In this
sense, their work was very
valuable—it had people think-
ing, discussing, cussing, in-
terested, and concerned. And
that, around here, takes some
doing.

It is all the more unfortunate,

that the paintings and the sculp-
ture aroused this interest in a
negative way. Here was a case
where the cause was consider-

those ably less than the effect.

FRIDAY, MAY 4, 1962

Davidson's Blues
Troop To U. Va.

Two officers of the Davidson
College Conservative Club are
attending a two-day seminar at
the University of Virginia this
weekend.

Leaving this morning for the
Charlottesville conference en-
titled ‘A Conservative Approach
to Foreign Policy” were Dick
Voorhees and Charles Dibble.

Included among the speakers
are Frank Meyer, Senior Editor
of National Review; Dr. Hans
Sennholz, Chairman of the Eco-
nomics Department of Grove
City College; and Dr. James
Wiggins, Chairman of the So-
ciology and Anthropology De-
partment at Emory University.

The conference is the first
Southern seminar conducted by
the Intercollegiate Society of
Individualists, a nine-year-old
conservative youth organization.
Host for the seminar is the John
Randolph Society of the Univer
sity of Virginia.

Frosh "Phi Bete”
Acquires Charter

A chapter of the national
freshman scholarship fraternity,
Phi Eta Sigma, will be chartered
at Davidson on Thursday, May
10.

The chartering of this organ-
ization will be the culmination
of the main project of the Fresh-
man Council this semester. Phi
Eta Sigma is founded on the
principle that excellence in
scholarship among college men
in the freshmen year merits
membership in an honorary fra-
ternity.

The charter will be presented
to Davidson by the Executive
Secretary of the fraternity,
James Foy of Auburn Univer-
sity Thursday evening. The oc-
casion for the presentation will
be a banquet given for the new-
ly initiated members of Phi Eta
Sigma and the members of the

Membership will be open to

After the softball game, the

will get to swe ol for an informal fish fry in Hobart Park

behind Richardson Field.

The rounds of golf, which will
start off the day’s events, will
be held at the Mooresville
course beginning’ at 1:30 in the
afternoon. The golfers will be
divided into mixed foursomes
of seniors and faculty members,
with scoring in each foursome
by the low aggregate system.

The tennis matches, beginning
at 2 p.m. on the Davidson courts,
will include only doubles play.
The reason for the lack of
singles play, laughingly explain-
ed by Coach Heath Whittle, is
that “you can’t get any of the
faculty ‘members to play sin-
gles.”

Charles Robshaw
Vespers Speaker

Rev. Charles P. Robshaw, min-
ister of the East Liberty Pres-
byterian Church in Pittsburgh,
Pa., will be the vespers preach-
er Sunday night. The title of
his sermon is “Identifying One-
self.”

The Reverend Mr. Robshaw,
STD, DD, LLD, is a native of
Ireland and was educated at the
University of Dublin. In_ this
country, he attended Princeton
University. Since that time he
has served pastorates both in
New Jersey and in Pennsylvania.

The softball game will begin

and will be followed 30 minutes
after its conclusion by the fish

Coach Whittle, who will or-
ganize participants, chuckled
when asked about the contests
in a DAVIDSONIAN interview.
“Usually the faculty wins the
events,” he stated with mock-
seriousness. “But of course, the
lettermen in golf, tennis, and
baseball are not eligible.”

P. 0. Tells Students
‘Summer's Coming’

The Davidson Post Office has
announced steps students should
take to insure prompt delivery
of mail to their summer ad-
dresses.

Students should immediately
turn in a change of address card
at the post office, with the ef-
fective date noted, to facilitate
forwarding of first-class mail.
The post office is affixing
change of address cards to maga-
zines and newspapers so stud-
ents can have the necessary
changes made by the end of
school to insure summer de-
livery of second-class mail with-
out paying forwarding charges.
Those who wish to retain the
same lock box for next year
should mail the Davidson post-
master a check or money order
for $3.60 payable to the post-
master after June 20th.

fore they were to give their
Spring Frolics concert. They
took time only to tune up the
fiddle, the banjo, and the guitar.
And they were ready to start
before most of the audience had
begun to filter into Chambers
Auditorium.

The group nected no more
time than that for they had al-
ready played every night that
week from Arkansas into North
Carolina. The audience, though
moderately small, was apprecia-
tive. A good many people came
backstage at intermission to re-
quest numbers. One fellow, bub-
bling over with excitement,
burst into the room and fairly
shouted, “I’m a Yankee, and I
just love this music! I've never
heard anything like it before!”
And he put in his request for a
tune. Flatt and Scruggs came
back for two curtain calls and
then had about 15 couples ask.
for autographs after the show.

Their style of music is pop-
uiarly called “bluegrass.”
Some people call it “country.”
Others make the mistake of
calling it “hillbilly.” But “hill-
.billy” is taken by mountain
folk to be a term of contempt,
and entertainers in the blue-
grass field take it as no less
so. While not every concert-
goer could be as enthusiastic
as that Yankee, there could
be no room for contempt after
the performance. For the
Foggy Mountain Boys are the
most popular band in their
field. And even though many
people's taste run to other
types of music, it is fitting at
times to lend an ear to the

The six members of the band
have a combined total of at
least 120 years in show business.
They are pros; they play for
money. But they also play be-
cause it is their life. None of
them would have it any other
way.

“The roughest part about
show business is the traveling,”
commented Hi-lo Brown, who
has been in it for 22 years. “For
instance, we just drove down
from Asheville today and will
go on down to Albemarle for a
show tonight. Then we will drive
all the way back to Nashville,
Tenn., right after that show. 1
can remember when we've made
as many as five television films
in the morning and then gone
on and did two concerts that
day.”

But the business has re-
wards. Money, of course. But
to see the men’s faces when

that money cannot buy. “We
really do enjoy playing before
a good audience,” said Lester
Flatt, a man of very few
words off stage.

Hi-lo’s knickname comes from
his unusual style of singing part
of a song in an extremely high
tenor voice and the rest of it in

.his normal voice. He is also a

the time in American life
and men made do with the

man who loves the old songs, the
folk songs that are the voice of
the people and hence the voice
of the very nation. His rendi-
tions of “John Henry” and “The
Prisoner’s Song” were excellent
examples of his style.

And last Saturday, Ear!
Scruggs gave a powerful dem-
onstration of why he is con-
sidered to be the banjo-pick-
in’‘ist man in the land. His
three-fingered style of picking
is now widely immitated by
banjo enthusiasts everywhere.
But none can match the skill
or dexterity with which he
manipulates the five-string.
Throughout the concert pro-
gram, he proved that point.

Cousin Jake, the group’s
funny-man has a different
voice pitch and little moun-
tain accent off stage. But he
can still crack jokes wherever
he is. “It’s hard to get a straw
hat to feel right on your
head,” said Les Flatt just be-
fore going on. “It’s hard to
get one to look right on that
head,” came back Jake.

It took them only 15 minutes
after the performance to pack
their instruments. And then
they were off to Albemarle.
Country music’s most traveled
group had to move on. “It’s the
same old story,” said Fiatt.
“There’s always more folks
waiting to hear bluegrass
music.”
