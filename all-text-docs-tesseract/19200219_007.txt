A LITTLE LIGHT ON
OUR A. E. F. STUDENTS
T. A. Lacy.

T. A. Lacy served during the war
as a private in the 113th Field Ar-
tillery, Battery F, which is better
known as the Piedmont Battery. En-
listing on July 16, 1917, Lacy was
sent to Camp Sevier, Greenville, S.
C.. where he was in training from
September 16, 1917, until May 20,
1918. Leaving here the battery
went to Brooklyn, N. Y¥.. from
whence it embarked on May 25.

Landing at Liverpool on June 7,
and crossing thru middle England by
rail, a stop being made at Win-
chester, the battery arrived at South
Hampton on June 11, The channel
was crossed that night and the fol-
lowing morning they landed at Le

camped at Camp De Coetquidan,
_ Brittany, an old artillery camp of
Napoleon, until August 23. Here
training was given in the use of the
French 75s, which were used
throughout the war. After receiv-
ling training here the battery moved

of to Toul and into the front on the
Schoolfield, Virginia, with Mrs. Bar-
nes, came to Davidson for the week-
end because of the illness of his

St. Mihiels salient. Lacy was en-
gaged here most of the time in haul-
ing ammunition to the front prep-
aratory to the drive of September

DR. RICHARDS EARNEST IN

PREACHING AND TEACHING

Now Professor in His Alma Mater.

Charles Malone Richards was
born at Liberty Hill, S.C, in 1871.
He was prepared for college in the
public school at that place, and en-
tered Davidson in 1888. He gradu-

ated from Davidson in 1892, being

third honor man of the class and de-
livering the philosophical oration.

After three years at Columbia (S.
C.) Seminary, one other year was

a . t

spent there in teaching Greek and
Hebrew. Then followed a pastor-
ate of five years at Mechanicsville,
S. C., and one of eight years at
Statesville, N.C. In 1907 Davidson
College conferred the degree of Doc-
tor of Divinity.

Dr. Richards became pastor of the
“Church on the Corner” at David-
son in 1909. Four years ago he be-
came Professor of Church History
and Government in the college. Also,
for two years he has been assisting
in the English course.

Dr. Richards is recognized by stu-
dents and townspeople alike as be-
longing to the old school of Presby-
tertans, the kind that built up the
Presbyterian Church and made it the
powerful influence it has been in
the life of the people not only of
America, but of other lands as well.
In addition to his work in building
up the college, probably no one man
in Davidson has had more to do
with moulding its life and ideals.
We are all glad that we can have
such a safe guide as Dr. Richards;
glad to have him to lift up before us

‘from Sabbath to Sabbath the ideals
lof Christianity that made our fath-
‘ers great; and glad to have his
lucid and earnest explanations of
Church History and Bible truths in
class and out.

Leaving this sector on the 14th of
September, he was next stationed in
the Meuse-Argonne sector, arriving
there on September 24. Mere also
the Piedmont Battery was partly
responsible for opening this drive.
The battery occupied three positions
on this sector. Leaving here about
October 3, the Piedmont Battery
moved to the Troyon sector, which
was part of the old St. Mihiel sa-
lient.
Troyon sector Lacy was transferred
to the observation post of the Sec-
ond Battalion, which overlooked the
plain of the Woevre, remaining here
until the armistice was signed.

About December 13, Lacy, again
in the Piedmont Battery, started on
a hike thru Luxemburg as a part of
the second army. Here. he spent
Christmas at the town of Colmar-
burg, just north of the city of Lux-
emburg. Leaving there on January
5, 1919, they returned to Le Man's,
where they were re-equipped and
started for home from St. Nazaire
on March 3. Landing at Newport
News on March 17, the battery went
to Raleigh, where the regiment pa-
raded on March 24. From here Lacy
went to Camp Jackson and was
there discharged froni the service on

school for several weeks, after
which training they were placed in

ley, "11, at Clinton, S. C.. on Sunday

plications developed which resulted

VOWS.

Mable Stamper, N. C. College.

As f sat in meditation
In the silence of the night,
And gazed at Heaven illumined
With its myriad points of light.
Al my soul went surging upward
Thru the portals, to the Throne
While the midnight stars together
Sang “God loves: you are His
awn.”

Then my soul in wonder questioned
At the barrenness of carth,
Pondered long upon the knowledge
That men lacked of things of
worth
Unto me a voice spoke, softly,
“Who will tell the world?
thou?”
And alone there in the darkness
Unio God | vowed a vow.
