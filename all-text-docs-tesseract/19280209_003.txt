Kittens Defeated
by Athletic Club

After leading the Statesville Athletic
Club by a doubled score for three quart-
ers, the Kittens fell behind in a rough-
and-tumble game Monday night and lost
by an 18-16 score at Statesville.

Each team looping one goal in the
first quarter gave a 2-all tie but the year-
lings brought the score up to 8-2 to end
the half. Coming back with a rush they
doubled this score but were unable to
add to it throughout the remainder of the
game while the Statesvillians brought
their score to 18.

The last quarter was featured by much
fouling and general rough play through-
out which kept the scores on both sides
in small numbers.

Advice of Col. F. H. Fries, '74, concegn-
ing investments, was received with en-
thusiasm by members of the Winston-
Salem Lions Club at a recent meeting at
which Colonel Fries was the guest of
honor and principal speaker. So sound
were the views of Colonel Fries that the
Winston-Salem papers took occasion to
commend them editorially to all bankers
and investors in the south. Sounding a
note of optimism in his survey of financial
conditions throughout the nation, Colone’
Fries paused to condemn the practice of
investing money in high-priced stocks and
bonds which should be used to pay debts.
He warned bankers and investors to be-
ware of investments of a speculative and
uncertain nature.

In their first game of the week andthe |
second meeting with Salisbury Y team
for the year, the Wildcat quint snatched
victory late in the second half to the
tune of 47-44. Tuesday night they won a
victory over Lenoir Rhyne 40-22. These

losses.

The Salisbury Y game, played at Salis-
bury, was a fast and exciting game in that
the winner was undecided until the clos-
ing minutes of play. Being led through-
out the entire first half, the ’Cats came
back to overcome a lead of 28-22 and
after having the score knotted a number
cf times, they took advantage of foul shots
and cinched their lead.

Pritchett’s shooting was a feature as he
accounted for 17 of the 47 points. For
the Y team, Robinson gained 13 counters,
and was second high-point man for the
game.

In the Lenoir-Rhyne game Tuesday
night, the Cats continued their winning |
streak and made the score 40-22, Thé
first half was not marked by either fast
or thrilling play on either side but the
second period saw Davidson pull away
and make 10 points before the Rhyneans |
counted. |

The second half saw more accurate
shooting and higher mounting scores as |
Pritchett and Charlie Harrison tossed |
many baskets. Close guarding on the |
part of the Davidsonians kept Lenoir- |
Rhyne from gaining much of a vantage |
point from which to shoot and resulted in |
many trys for long shots from near mid- |
court. }

| Honorary Societies

| Lincoln, Neb. (New, Student Service)—
| Six underclass honorary societies at the
University of Nebraska are on tne verge
of death, their fate now resting in fac-
ulty hands.

Their abolition was recommended by
the student council, following long agi-
tation against purposeless organizations
by The Daily Nebraskan. The faculty
has delayed action to permit defense
|pleas. In anouncing the council action
The Nebraskan said editorially :

“There was little justification for these
|societies which had existed solely be-
|} cause certain ambitious men and women
students wished to have important sound-
ling clyby names placed among their
achievements in college activities.”
| The Nebraskan used the past tense be-
cause it expected and hoped—that the fac-
ulty would impose death immediately.

The honoraries in question are dis-
| tinguished by such fine names as Vikings,
Silver Serpents, Iron Sphinx, Xi Delta,
Green Goblins, and Mystic Fish.
