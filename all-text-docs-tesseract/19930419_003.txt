Former Students Flock to Alumni Weekend

By Shaye Benton

Bearing a license plate from
Florida, acar pulled up behind two
Davidson students taking a Friday
afternoon walk by the tenniscourts,
“Excuse me, can you tell me how
to get to Davidson College?” said
the older man with a twinkle in his
eye. Obviously well acquainted
with the area, the man drove on to
show his wife his old dorm.

Davidson College alumni
poured in on April 16th fora week-
end of beautiful weather. When
over 1,000 former Davidson stu-
dents arrived at their alma mater
for Alumni Weekend, the Alumni

According to the new leaders,
the students have faced some re-

luctance from administrators. .

They attribute the hesitation to a
fear of anti-faculty and adminis-

tration propaganda. But the lead-
ers have insisted that the intent is
solely to offer an avenue for stu-
dent expression of opinion.

Choo explains that adminis-
trators also, “don’t want to see
money end up in.a black hole.”

Choo will serve as Technical Di-

What makes this effort any
different from those which have
not succeeded in the past? The
organizers insist that their execu-
tive board has an unusual amount
of experience with radio produc-

- tion, They also believe their orga-

nization and commitment set them
apart from the WALTs of the past.
Bowman says the “‘lastefforts have
been abysmal failures. There has
never been this much organiza-
tion.

“If we cater to student inter-
est, which we will, it will be popu-
lar,” he continues with confidence.

The immediate plans include

using the current cable TV lines to
increase the broadcasting area to
include any locations receiving
cable television. The following
step would install the ten watt trans-
mitter on the top of the Union or
Baker when the FCC grants the
license. This would allow, WALT
to be heard-across campus and
even beyond when weather per-

‘mits. Eventually the group hopes

to include Cornelius and even
northern Charlotte.

If all goes as planned, this
fall students can listen for WALT
programs on 580 AM and possibly
onFM below 90. Initial broadcast-
ing will last 3-4 hours a day de-
pending on student volunteers to
DJ and arrange programming.

John Mack & Son thanks you for your continued
support and congratulates the class of 1993 for an
outstanding year! Good luck on exams, have a great
summer, and come see us next fall for your

back-to-school shopping.

Downtown Mooresville for 81 years

Office knew the hard work and
planning had paid off.

Including the latecomers driv-
ing or flying to North Carolina
from hundreds of miles away, the
visiting alumni totaled between
1,100 and 1,200 men and women
this weekend. The many activities

planned for the classes who gath- .

ered for their reunions were all
extremely successful and well-at-
tended.

Reunion Coordinator Christy
Knight said that one of the most
enjoyable events was the Band
Party at Baker Sports Complex on
Saturday night. The party was
planned for the six youngestclasses
at Davidson this weekend: the
classes of ’68, ’73, ’77-’79, and
*83. Around400 alumni were there
to attend the event, lasting from
9:00-1:00 a.m., and to hear a vari-
ety of music.

The biggest eventof the week-
end was the reunion for alumni
who graduated 50 years ago, the
Class of '43. Asurprising 50 of the
100 members of the class came to
commemorate their days at

Davidson. To accompany the 50
alumni were many spouses and
other family members. All were
invited by President Kuykendall to
Vail Commons for a special cel-
ebration.

To help out with the weekend,
dozens of students volunteered
theirtime foralumni activities. Stu-
dents participated by bartending,
setting up for the events, making
deliveries, and registering the
guests at parties. .

While the weekend provided

a chance for many alumni to cel-
ebrate with one another, it also
allowed a time for each person to
reflect on his or her college years.
Sitting on the grass of Patterson
Court Friday evening was an alum
looking down the hill; deep in
thought. Many others strolled the
campus, thoroughly enjoying be-
ing back at Davidson.
\.. One alum remarked that he
réalized only after leaving college
how ideal the Davidson atmosphere
really is, how much Davidson
taught him, and how much the
school meant to him.

Students Bare

Breasts in Protest

NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ (CPS)-
-Police were called to break up a
student protest that involved 30
female students who-bared their
breasts during a student govern-
ment, ..mecting,.at. Rutgers
University’s Douglass College.

“There were no arrests,” said
college spokeswoman Pam Orel.
“As far as we know, there will be
no disciplinary actions, either.”.

Kerry Riordan, 20, a sopho-
more and political science major,
said the demonstration was in pro-
test of the student government’s
treatment of some of the students
that included “gaveling down”
students in meetings who attempt
to question authority. ;

Riordan said that the patron-
izing attitude included not allow-
ing students to have a 24-hour
study center, and not supplying
security and additional lights on
campus after several rapes.

The demonstration, said
Riordan, was modeled after a ges-
ture made by Soujourner Truth, a
19th century abolitionist who
bared her breasts to prove that she
was a woman after being criti-
cized for “not behaving like a
woman.”

"It was aliberating act. They
have an idea of a stereotype of

women,” Truth said.

Sexually Oriented Pinball
Machines Cause Stir
COLUMBUS, OHIO (CPS) —
Three Elvira pinball machines
have some students, faculty and
staff members at Ohio State Uni-.
versity on “tilt” because of the
character’s suggestive statements
and clothing.

Some students have asked
that the pinball machines, which
are located in the lobbies of three
dormitories, be removed. “Stu-
dentsand staffare concerned about
the graphics.

“They tend to be sexually
exploitive or really focus on vio-
lence and lack of human regard,”
said Rebecca Parker, the
university’s associate director for
resident life.

When points are scored on
the Elvira machine, her breasts
light up, and a recorded voice
makes statements like, “Don’t
touch me there.”

A group of student leaders in
the dormitories and housing staff
members are planning to meet to
see if the machines can be taken
out. However, Jennifer Geras, a
sophomore who lives in a dorm
that houses an Elvira pinball ma-
chine, said she saw one already

. being carted away in a truck.
