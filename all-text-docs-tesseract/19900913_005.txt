Where Do You Stand, Jesse?

By GILBERT SHAW '91

“Where do you stand, Jim?”

Those of you from North Caro-
lina must forgive me for harking
back to those many days in 1984

_ when we heard this question asked
repeatedly by Jesse Helms. I have
been. waiting for something simi-
lar to bombard my ears during the
present U.S. Senate race between
Jesse Helms and former Charlotte
Mayor Harvey Gantt.

But we haven’t heard from
Jesse anything like: “Where do
you stand, Harvey?”

I think I know why. Harvey
Gantt is no luke-warm candidate.
Gantt has defined his positions
clearly since the outset of his
campaign.

Perhaps, it is time, however,
for Mr. Helms to answer the same
question of himself:

“Where do you stand, Jesse?”

Here we get into a bit of a grey
area.

The problem isn’t that Mr.
Helms lacks opinions. He lacks
answers, Perhaps, more fundamen-

tally, Mr. Helms fails to see the ©

problems and challenges that face
our state and our nation in 1990
and in the coming century.

The world of 1990 has changed
radically and unpredictably from
the days of Mr. Helms’ last elec-

tion in 1984. Today, the Cold War

has all but completely thawed and
the United States and. the Soviet
Union enjoy unprecedented warm
relations with one another. Our
mutual efforts in standing firm
against Saddam Hussein are but
the most recent manifestations of

this dramatic shift Indeed, today. -

polls reflect that the majority of
Americans no longer see the So-
viet Union as the primary risk to
our way of life. Instead, Ameri-
cans view the growing global eco-
nomic competition we face from
Japan and Europe as more perti-
nent to our future prosperity.

But don’t take my word for it,
just ask President Bush. Last year
the President convened with Gov-
ernor Martin and the Governors of

risk. American students were con-
sistently out-performed in stan-
dardized tests given to students of
other industrial nations. “How
well,” it was asked,” will Ameri-
can companies and American citi-
zens_compete-in the twenty-first
century?”

Noticeably silent in offering
any constructive opinion has been
Jesse Helms. Indeed, in 1990, Jesse
Helms was one of only eight sena-
tors to vote against President
Bush’s Educational Excellence
Act.

Jesse Helms’ lack of concern
for American education goes back
even further. In 1987, Mr. Helms
threw the only negative senate
vote against the Elementary and
Secondary Education Improve-

Mr. Helms fails to see
the problems and chal-
lenges that face our
state and our nation in
1990 and in the coming

century.
a IE]

ment Act, which provides for such
programs as the Rural Educational
Opportunites Program, the Fam-
ily-School Partnership Program,
and the: Comprehenseve School
Health Program. Likewise, in 1986,
Mr. Helms was the only senator to
vote against the: Higher Education
Act Amendments which provide
aid to colleges and college stu-
dents. And in 1989, 1987, three
times in 1986, 1985, 1982, and five
times in 1981, Jesse Helms voted
against funding for Pell Grants,
which help students of low-income
families afford post-secondary
education.

Somehow or another Jesse
Helms hasn’t gotten the word from
those on Capitol Hill or in the
White House that the “c”’-word has
changed from “communism” to
“competitiveness.” Thus, Mr.
Helms continues nuking vital
education programs put forth by

recommendation of Senator Sam
Nunn (D-Ga.) and the Senate
Armed Services Committee, Jesse
Helms was one of only. seven sena-
tors to support building all 132 B-
2 stealth bombers.

In contrast, Harvey Gantt
knows that times have changed
and America must change with
them if we wish to remain strong
and grow stronger. First, Mr. Gantt
realizes that more investment must
be put into our education. Not
merely an investment of money,
but of concem. He knows from his
own life that education is the key to
opportunity. After graduating with
Honors from Clemson, which he
integrated in 1963, Mr. Gantt went
on to recieve his Master’s Degree
in city planning from M.I.T. It was
through education that Harvey
Gantt was given the ability to
compete and succeed asanarchitect
and politician.

Furthermore, Mr. Gantt be-
lieves that America’s national
defense should remain strong and,
importantly, viable. Such was the
message of Harvey Gantt last June
when he spoke to the Veterans of
Foreign Wars saying, “[the United
States] will have to maintain a
focused vigilance and a strong
defense.” The Mideast crisis dem-
onstrates that the United States
must, as Mr. Gantt went on to say,
“plan the kind of military posture,
structure and defense that is tech-
nologically superior, but stream-
lined to fit the kind of world that
we’re living in,”

~ Quite frankly, ‘the kind of
world that we’re living in’ is not
the same one Jesse Helms is. This

. he continually demonstrates in his

irresponsible neglect for education
and his impractical approach to
national defense. It’s time we sent
asenator to Washington who lives
in our world. One who will de-
mand the biggest “bang for the
buck” not only for defense but for
education as well. Refreshingly,
we will have such a candidate in
Harvey Gantt. As for Jesse Helms,
I’ll just send him a few pieces of
the Berlin Wall. I have several in

the other states to address the short-
falls of public education through-
out the country. Serving as the
major impetus for the meeting was
the growing perception that such
shortfalls posed a national security

the President and Congress while
atthe same time supports spending
billions of dollars for B-2 bombers
to nuke the Soviets. Noticeably,
Helms stands relatively alone in
his defense positions. Against the

my room as souvenirs.

Everything I Needed to Know

First of all, I think I need to ©

address those of you who seem to
be lacking a little something in the
sense of humordepartment by tell-
ing you that my article about
smoking last week was a JOKE!!

I must admit I was a little sur-

prised that so many of my fellow -

students actually took meseriously,

so let me establish now thatI WAS

KIDDING! Lighten up, folks.
Anyway, on to new business.
Just the other day as I was sit-

ting back listening to my Muppet

Movie Soundtrack album, drink-
ing a cup of General Foods Inter-

national Coffee, and wondering
whatever happened to Jan of The
Brady Bunch, | spied an advertise-
ment for Robert Fulghum’s book
Everything I Ever Needed to Know
I Learned in Kindergarten.
Thecopy said something about
what a heartwarming collection of
essays the book contained, and how
Mr. Fulghum manages to touch

the child in all of us or something ©

silly like that.

Well, needless to say, this was
a little too much for my sensibili-
ties: I spitout the coffee, nuked the
muppets for a little Parliament of

Funk, and reminded myself that
Jan would probably never go fora
guy like me anyway.

Having returned to my normal
self, I realized that everything I
ever needed to know I learned in
my first year at Davidson, and
decided to compile a list.

1) Don’t spit on the Dean.

2) Showing up for class with a
hangover will not necessarily en-
gender a great deal of fondness for
you in the hearts of your profes-
sors. (Showing up drunk, how-
ever, will endear you to them for at

Don't Forget the
Common People

By RAMI EL-AMINE '92

My father returned today,
Sunday, September 2, 1990, to
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia tocontinue
his thirty-second year of service
with the United States military.
Mohammed El Amine, my father,
is from a small village in southern
Lebanon which has been occupied
by the Israelis since the 1982 inva-
sion of Uur country.

However, Shagqra, the village,
has been the target of the Israeli
government’s brutality since long
before then. The majority of the

—-villagers grow tobacco toexportto

the United States and other indus-
trial countries. They are not
wealthy people, but at one time
they werecontent with their simple
life.

Unfortunately, life is getting
more difficult for the people of
Shaqra as Israeli harassment, in-
terrogation, and oppression of the
men drudges into its eighth year.
For my father, life is also getting
more difficult because, by paying
taxes, he is in a sense supporting
this brutalization of hisown people.

My intentions here are to
awaken you to a simple fact: the
majority of the Arab people are not
wealthy oil sheikhs who have the
privilege of attending prestigious
schools, interacting with the out-
side world, and the means to
modernize their country. These
privileges are reserved to such oil
rich countries as Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and
the United Arab Emerites.

Even in these countries, the
rich are nota large majority. They
care little for what goes on in my

America, by reverting
to military action, has
destroyed the possibil-
ity of a diplomatic solu-
tion.

small village of Shakra, but when
their conscience begins to bother
them, they send acheck to our gov-
ernment which the people of Sha-
gra never see.

‘ Thecommon Arab, on the other
hand, knows-_little-of the outside_
world except that which directly
effects them. Forexample, the fact
that America gives Israel $3.7 bil-
lion a year in cconomic and mili-
tary grants (more than $1000 per
Israeli citizen) to sustain its occu-
pation of two Arab countries
(Lebanon and Syria), and depriva-
tion of a third, the Palestinians, of
self-determination.

Not to mention its inhumane
treatment of all three occupied
peoples. Because such realities are
at the core of everything we do as
Arabs, Israel has become a factor
of instability rather than, as Amer-
ica insists, stability in the Middle
East.

So, you are probably asking,
what does this have to do with
Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and what
is the point of my writing this opin-
ions piece? Well, contrary to Presi-
dent Bush’s statements, the Arab-
Israeli conflict and the unbalanced
distribution of wealth among the
Arabcountries and people is notan
