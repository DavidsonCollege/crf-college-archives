versus Division I programs, among
them two games against a South-
ern Conference team, Western
Carolina. Next year the ‘Cats will
play all Division I teams and will
play every school in the Southern
Conference once. Beginning in
1994-95, the Davidson women’s
basketball program will be a full-
fledged Division I program _and
will play a full Southern Confer-
ence schedule.

Filar admits it is hard to make
expectations for sucha young team.
“T only tell my players to play their
hearts out . . .not'to have any re-
grets when they come off the court,”
Filar says. “I feel we played that
way last year. People will be sur-
prised . . . at the level women’s
basketball can be played at now.
They will see flashes of brilliance
[with this team], and then will see
flashes of inexperience. But this
team works hard, and I don’t feel
anyone who sees us will go away
thinking we didn’t play hard.”

With sophomores likely rounding out the starting linewp, this team
appears to be well-situated to contend seriously for the next two years.
Next season, three current juniors who are studying abroad will rejoin
the team and should strengthen it considerably.

“I want [the freshmen] to learn to compete on the college level and
handle the nervousness,” Oddo said. “I don’t care who you are, you can
beat anybody on any given day and that is the attitude you have to
develop.”

Leading the team will be sophomores Derek Spencer (in the 142
and_150 Ibs divisions) and Jared Glick-(150.and-158) and freshman Sean
Harvey (126 and 134). Other members of the team include Robbie:
Fierro, Francis Mitchell, and Henry Neale.

' The heavyweights, some of whom just began practice after the
conclusion of football season, include Bo Bartholomew, Tommy Greene,
James Cassidy, and Brian Parrish.

After surprising performances in the team’s two preseason
invitationals, Oddo is looking forward to this season and also is excited
about next season. “The whole key to the year will be the three things,”
he said: “experience, recruiting and the return of those three starters.”
