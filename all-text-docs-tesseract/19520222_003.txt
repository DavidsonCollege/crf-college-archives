Maybe the jinx has
been broken or the law
of averages finally
caught up and repaid
little ‘ole Davidson, but
at any rate we won a
ball game last Monday
night and the whole
student body should be
in the throes of sheer
ecstasy. I heard one pro-
fessor say that he hadn't
missed a game all year,
but decided with a ‘‘ah,
well” attitude to give
the little wife a break
and let her go to the
game and stay with the
kids himself. He was disgusted, no less, the following day.

Another student connected with the team ex-
pressed better than I'd ever heard the whole situation.
“Ie tuened the season from a disgrace to just @ poor
season. It was just like the first breath of Spring
after a long, hard. and cold winter to have gone to the
game last Monday night and felt the feeling of win-
ning and beating a team that you knew was among
the better teams in the conference.”

SCOTT BLAMES PSYCHOLOGICAL WEARINESS

Coach Tom Scott came out the next day in The Observer
saying that his team was ‘‘tired’’ and that it was physical as
well as spiritual. He says the team has been “beating its head
against the wall’’ of student indifference. At some of the games,
he said he felt like leading some cheers himself and that the at-
tendance was so sparse at some of the games, that he felt like
moving the bench to the stands.

These things have been circulating about the basketball
situation at Carolina for years, and possibly they are becoming
worse. It’s a know fact that the Tar Heels have been suffering
from a slump and something must be the trouble. Scott went on
to say that, contrary to public belief, he did not get ‘‘half the
scholarships that Wake Forest or Maryland give, or one third
what Duke gives.”

WHAT ABOUT COACH BAIRD?

All this is room for gripe and discontent, but what about
Coach Boyd Baird and the po’ Wildcats? He doesn’t get half
the scholarships that Scott gets and although the student body
has been unusually loyal and interested, the fact still remains
that this has been one of our worst seasons in the past decade
or so. It must be that the Cats have played good ball here at
home and have lost so many heartbreakers that the support is
still strong and now should be stronger than ever with only
one more home contest on the slate.

It seems to me that Coach Scott's problem is es-
sentially the same as that of ‘King Carl’’ Snavely.
When you hit the big time and burn up the league. you
Gre expected to continue the pace or a slump will ruin
the whole thing, because the fans are used to winning
and become discontent with a few losing seasons. This
precisely has happened to buth the Carolina coaches,
but fortunately or unfortunately as you may look at it,
Davidson has never had to suffer with this problem
nor its coaches either. Our problem is only keeping
spirit up despite the losing teams.

HISTORY WAS MADE.IN JOHNSTON GYM

Actually the game started off slowly with the Cats taking
the lead and building up a few points lead before the half.
especially on Joe Dudley’s last-minute, not-so-desperate shot.
The second half was a different story with the Heel's much-
ribbed Deasy taking the initiative. Also on the home forces new
life was experienced. Al Fitzgerald and ‘‘Ish'’ Bennett, who had
taken the flu-ridden King’s place, seemed to be the sparks that

set off the fire.

It was a team victory, however, and that is where

the beauty of the whole matter comes in.

For the

first time this season, although they faltered toward
the last of the regulation game. the Cats have been able
to effectively ‘‘freeze’’ the ball. In this fact lies the
partial answer to our having dropped so many close
ones. The only other aspect is our failure to show

scoring punch in the clinch.

Mac McLean and Ish were magnificent in their handling
of the ball and it was Bennett's “easy” crip that stowed the
game away. The entire team should get the laurels and the

laurels can be supplied by you.

Wildcats Swim
Tiger Tankers

By MOODY ,SMITH

With a very good chance of
finishing the season with a. win-
ning percentage, the Davidson Col-
lege swimming team departs for
Clemson tomorrow to face the
Tiger in its lair, so to speak.

The Wildcat “fish” have thus
far thig season won 4 meets
while losing a like number, In-
cluded in their list of victories
is a previous triumph over the
Tiger tankmen by the score of
57 to 27. Should they defeat
Clemson and go on to take
next Monday at Davidson the
measure of The Citadel whom
they have already beaten once
this season, they would assure
themselves of a season’s record
of 6 wins, 4 losses. After con-
cluding their regular season
with the Citadel meet, the Cat.
fish will participate in the
Southern Conference meet to be
held February 28-March 1 at
Caroline.

The Catfish boast victories
over South Carolina, whom
they have decisioned twice,
Clemson, and The Citadel, hav-
ing dropped meets to North
Carolina, VPI, State and Wash-
ington & Lee. ~

Davidson's swimming team, ini-
tiated only two years ago, has
quickly won for itself a place of
respect in Southern Conference
swimming competition, and pros-
pects for the future success of local

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests

Descendea from a long line of distinguished
researchers, this studious scholar has burned too many
gallons of midnight oil to gloss over a subject lightly.
Especially such an important item as cigarette mildness.
He burrowed into the matter with his usual resolution
and concluded that a “quick puff” or a “fast sniff”
doesn’t offer much evidence. Millions of smokers agree
there’s but one true test of cigarette mildness.

It’s the sensible test...the 30-Day Camel Mildness
Test, which simply asks you to try Camels as your
steady smoke on a day-after-day, pack-after-pack basis.
