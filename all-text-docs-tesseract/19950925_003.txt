MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1995 3

By Joshua BUCHANAN
Operations Manager

Ever ponder the great myster-
ies of Davidson College? Have
you sat for hours, attempting to
understand the nature of the
library’s carpet? Or the essence of
flickerball? Well read carefully,
knowledge-seekers, for one of the
great mysteries is about to be un-

folded to you: the mystery.of... the

laundry.

NEWS FEATURE

Yes, the laundry. No matter
what gets yourclothes clean today,
just about everyone here has the
big bundles of brown paper to grab
at one time or another. And the
questions they raisé have been the

_ Source of conversation for fresh-
man halls throughout the school’s
history. “How do they keep track
of my stuff, even though I know I
didn’t put my number on it?”
“What do those numbers mean on

my ticket?” and “Do they actually .

employ someone to smash my but-
tons?”

Well here is the story, from
start to finish. That Bag o’ Laundry
you bring goes into those big hold-
ing containers. It is here that the
magic begins.

The bags of laundry are sorted
and weighed, their weight recorded
on a ticket along with the laundry
number, and are placed into mesh
bags. They pin these bags together
with the biggest safety pins I have
ever seen. Each of these pins has a
number on it that they use to keep
track of whose things they have.
This is also the point where laun-

. dry workers begin to lose their

sight. Have you ever squinted at
your clothes, trying to decide if
that laundry number is still
discernable enough to keep you
from breaking out the Rub-A-Dub
pen? Well, they squint, too. (Please,
save their eyes. Use that laundry
marker.) A ticket is written out at
this time that follows the bags
throughout their journey"
These mesh bags make their
way into the washing machines
themselves. Yes, for those of you
out there wondering, they do use
soap. After the load is done (and a
rather alarming yelp from the ma-
chine indicates it is finished), they
hang the loads onto a rack to be
sent to the dryers. The rack itself,
with all its.open safety pins and

large, lumpy bags, conjures im-
ages of the warehouse scene in
Rocky — you know, the one where
he’s punching the meat.

The clothes are taken out of
the mesh bags and thrown in the
dryer, much like you would do
your own laundry. When finished
they are removed and folded and
then, with a lightning-like motion,
wrapped in the brown paper we all
know and love. I must admit that
one needs to see this in action —
the wrapping is over before you
know it.

That is the basic process for
normal clothes. “But wait!” you
might say, “Is that all there is to
cleaning my clothes?” The answer
is aresounding NO! A quick tour
of the highlights of the other parts

of the laundry will show you that
getting your clothes clean, ALL of
your clothes, is a complicated pro-
cess,

No description of the laundry
could be complete without men-
tioning the Flatwork Iron. Offi-
cially named the “Simplex
Flatwork Finisher,” it is a gigantic
device with all kinds of mysterious
looking belts and buttons. This’
device irons the bedclothes that
the laundry supplies. It performs
this task in a way ‘that I wasn’t
capable of understanding at the
time, but nevertheless produces
impressive results. The laundry
staff also tried to show me how it
could be used to fold the sheets as
well, but that wasn’t terribly im-
pressive. It performed the action,

but not very well, like trying to get
that Slinky to race down the stairs
when you know deep down that it
really is not going to work.

The dry cleaning area provided
further mysteries to unravel. John
Cherry enthusiastically explained
the functions of the different de-
vices. He underscored the fact that
“dry” cleaning does not mean the

means they don’t get wet with

achemical called Perkosomething,
but one of those molecular model

plain it fully here. Suffice to say,

they go in dry and come out the

Town to off-campus
students: Be
considerate or else

By KATHERINE DAVIS
Staff Writer

During the September13 meet-
ing at the Davidson Town Hall,
off-campus students were sum-
moned to discuss with Chief of
Police Hank McKiernan off-cam-
pus parties. The students were sum-
moned to the meeting because town
residents found some of their par-
ties to be disruptive.

This was not a meeting aimed
at criticizing the students but rather
as a means of discussing plans
which would be helpful in keep the
College and community on good
terms.

“T understand that we live ina
small town and we can’t go raising
hell all the time in a community of
citizens, but at the same time, we
are college students who are living
in a college town,” said Brad Orr.

“T agree that there needs to be
some kind of understanding by both

students who live on and off cam- |

pus that guidelines exist and they
are meant to be met. Some may
think it unfair but I see it as simply
a fact of life.”

McKiernan made some sug-
gestions to the students as to how
they could avoid trouble with the
law and perhaps disruption of their
neighbors as well.

He stated that if students who
are throwing a party begin to see it
getting out of hand, they them-
selves should contact the police by
dialing 911 and have officers come
to the scene of the party to quiet
things down or disperse the crowds
if the party hosts cannot do so on
their own.

If this happens, the police of-
ficers will not file a written com-
plaint for the students’ permanent
records nor will they contact the
landlords the next day.

However, if a party does get
out of hand and a neighbor has to

Bone marrow drive asks for help

By REPRESENTATIVES OF
Project LIFE

We are a group of Davidson
College students collectively called
Project Life. Each year we are
responsible for organizing a bone
marrow drive on the Davidson
College campus to enroll students,
faculty, and community members
on the National Donor Registry.

With the assistance of the Red
Cross, blood samples are taken
from volunteers to be tissue tested
and added to the National Regis-
try. Bone marrow transplants are
critical in saving many people from
life threatening diseases such as
leukemia, aplastic anemia, breast
cancer, and.over 60 other fatal dis-
eases.

Unfortunately, the detailed
blood work involved with typing
each volunteer costs $60. As you
can imagine, overcoming the cost
of analysis is the major obstacle
we face in putting together a suc-
cessful drive. This year, the drive
will be November 15, and we must
begin fundraising now in order to
accommodate our goal of enroll-
ing four hundred new volunteers.

The 1995-96 academic year
will be the sixth consecutive year
that Project Life has held a bone
marrow drive. The effort began
with three Davidson College stu-
dents who had successful trans-
plant operations, and recognized
the need to enlarge the National
Donor Registry. In the previous
five years, the Davidson drive has
‘been directly responsible for plac-
ing over 1,700 people on the Reg-
istry. Since 1993, five Davidson
students have donated their mar-
row to patients in need of trans-
plants. As the most successful
student run: drive in the country,
we have become a model and a
resource for other schools inter-
ested in starting a similar program,

Tragically, a patient has only one
chance in 20,000 of finding an
unrelated bone marrow donor on
the national registry. These odds
are improved each year by the work
of organizations like ours here at
Davidson College.

The money that we raise is
graciously matched by the National
Marrow Donor Program. In doing
so, they enable us to double the
number of volunteers we can type
with our financial limitations, Each
$60 contribution will give two more
people the opportunity to save a
life. Thank you for your time and
consideration.

Please mail any contributions
to P.O. Box 834, Davidson, NC
28036.
