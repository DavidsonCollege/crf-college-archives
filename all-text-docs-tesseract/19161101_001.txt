Red and Black Wins
From Roanoke College

Davidson Defeats Opponents on
Their Home Grounds.

Outclassing their opponents at every
stage of the game and uncovering plays
that completely dumbfounded them,
Davidson triumphed over Roancke
College at Roanoke Saturday by the
score of 20 to 0. While the Roanoke
eleven fought hard, and were cheered
on by their enthusiastic supporters, yet
they were unable to offer strong enough
resistance to stop the Red and Black
machine as it swept across the field.

Keesler, as usual, played a sensational
game for Davidson, his field geiersi-
ship and fast running being a feature,
and making the first touchdowns possi-
ble. He was succeeded in the second
half by Lawson, who also showed up
well. The Walker brothers. “Bob”
and “Steve,” starred in almost every
play, the former scoring two of David-
son’s touchdowns. Sayad was a bul-
wark in the line, and the Roanoke ,.a-
pers say that “White, at center, gave
an exhibition here which has never been
equalled on the local gridiron.” Ans
pach, at left half, and Eastes, right end,
were. the par.icular stars for Roanoke.
The game was featured. by heavy pen-
alties, Davidson losing 97 yards and
Roanoke 78 for breaches of rules.

Interesting Exercises Held--- Dr.

Whaling Makes Address.

On last ‘Thursday, October 26th,
Davidson College Day was celebrated.
this being the eightieth anniversary of
the founding of Davidson College. ‘Ihe
true date of its founding is March 4,
1837, but it has become the custom to
celebrate this anniversary during the tall
term.

At 11:30 all the students assembled
in Shearer Hall and the regular morning
devotional exercises were conducted by
Dr. Arbuckle. Immediately after the
devotional exercises, Dr. Fulton, chair-
man of the Faculty Committee, took
charge of the meeting. After the singing
of a song, the honor roll for the past
year was real by Dr. Lingle. Dr. Hard-
ing then gave an account of what is be-
ing done and what has already been ac-
complished by some prominent Davidson
men. He stated that from 1870 to 1916
there had been 1.358 men who had re-
ceived A.B. and B.S. degrees. Another
item of note was that 3 out of the 4
seminaries in the South have Davidson
College graduates as presidents, and that
among the zreat men who have attended
Davidson ‘s to be found President
Woodrow Wilson. He closed by saying
that Davidson was especially honored by
having as the speaker of the dav one o
Ner former students, Dr. Thornton
Whaling, of Columbia, S. C.

Dr. Whaling was then introduced by
Professor Fulton. Dr. Whaling was a
member of the class of 1877, and a class-
nate of Woodrow Wilson. He is now
he President of Columbia Theological
Seminary, of Columbia, S.C.

Dr. Whaling chose as his subject the
three necessary elements of. a college
man, ‘Vhese three elements, he said, are
courage, humor and faith. He explain
ed that it is impossible to look into the
future and see what is going to happen
tomorraw. The drama of life is ever
shifting, and the scenery changes even
as we look. Danger and unexpected oc-
currences are a daily part of every man's
life. especially one who wants to be a
real man. For this reason men should
be equipped for every crisis, and the pur-
nose of the college +is to equip men in
both mind and body for the battle of life.

He explained that a man can never
reach true manhood as long as he lets
what other people sav about him in-
fluence his life. He should decide what
is right, and then have courage enough
to stick to his principles; no matter what
the other fellow says. True courage
means to hold to the highest that we
know, no matter what the different par-
ties mat present to us.

He stated that courage and humor
may be called twin sisters. The inci-
dents that are the most humorous often
contain the greatest truths and lessons.
while some characteristics of men and
even of nations are sometimes best ex-
pressed and understood through a joke.
In the little incidents that happened in
the lives of Shakespeare, Abraham Lin-
coln. Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson,
and even in the characters of the Bible.
we see that each one possessed a deep
sense ot humor. By this sense of humor
lawyers win their cases in court, mer-

avidson College Day (Two Lectures Given
Celebrated Thursday} at Davidson Last Week

One in Form of Moving Pictures,
the Other on Persia.

The Student Body and town-people
were favored with a treat Friday night
when the moving pictures of Sir Doug-
las Mawson’s Antarctic expedition were
shown in Shearer Hall under the aus-
pices of the feculty. This is the first of
a series of lectures to be given this year.

The pictures were entertaining, and
not only were of interest from a scien-
tific standpoint, but had great educa-
tional value as well, showing in a vivid
way animal life of the polar regions, and
the thrilling experiences of the explor-
ers. The pictures are under the ex-
clusive management of Lee Keedick, of
New York, and were in six reels, and
were shown and explained by an oper-
ator sent from the company.

Among the most interesting features
were the pictures of the penguins, sub-
marine birds who possess almost human
intelligence. Their antics and comic
walk brought forth many laughs. The
views of the icebergs and effects of bliz-
zards were also very interesting.

LECTURE ON PERSIA

Rev. Paul Shimmon, of Urimiah,
Persia, last Wednesday night at the
Presbyterian church gave a very  inter-
esting lecture on the effects of the pres-
ent war in Persia. By use of a map of
Persia and surrounding countries — he
pointed out the location of the Armen
ians with respect to Russia, Persia and
‘Turkey. ‘Phe strategic position of the
Armenians caused the “Purks to) think
that the Russians, thru this the territory
of their Christian brothers, might some
dav invade “Turkey. So the “Furks
forced the Armenians to migrate to oth-
er parts of the ‘Turkish Empire. hr.
Shimmon made the astounding © state-.
ment that up to this fall about 75,000 of
the Armenians had perished, most of
them while migrating.

Next he brought the scene nearer to
his home. He said. when the Russian
troops were called from Northwestern
Persia, to keep the Turks from severing
communications, by destroying the rail-
road, that then was the time the fanatic
Mohammedans and all who hated the
Christians persecuted them most severe-
ly. For ten days an_ indescribable
reign of terror prevailed. ‘The Kurds.
a wild, mountainous, Mohammedan
tribe, incited by the Germans and the
‘Turks, came down, and without any re-
gard for rank or file, and without any
quarter, devastated and plundered
towns. Men, women and children were
treated in treacherous and brutal ways,
As many people as could came to Uru-
miah and put themselves in the Amer-
ican mission compound and under the
American flag. Mr. Shimmon experi-
enced many of the trials of the fugutive.
He spoke of the heroic missionaries who
gave up their lives to save others.

At the close of the lecture a free-will
offering was taken, and the sum was
sent to New York Citv by Dr. J. M.
Douelas, to the Committee on Relief
for Armenian and Syrian sufferers.

Mrs. Shimmon is the sister of Mr.
Yonan. who was a student of Davidson,
and who in the summer of 1906 made
