Rusk Trophy Project
Gathers Momentum

inter-fraternity service trophy, named in honor
arotary of St 4 Rusk, will be offered beginning

of Secretary of State Dean
next. year.

A group of seniors this week
began working to establish the
award, to be offered to the
Davidson fraternity whose year-
long activities are judged to be
most beneficial to the college
and the community.

The group now hopes to
purchase a sterling bow! simi-
far to the Belk Scholarship
trophy. It would be present-
ed each spring after a faculty-
citizen committee made selec-
tions on the basis of an exam-
ination of each fraternity’s
year-round program.

About thirty seniors have join-
ed the founding committee, and
are beginning plans for the es-
tablishment of the award.

A brochure prepared by the
committee stated:

“This award will carry a
double incentive: prestige and
a handsome, practical trophy
— to encourage fraternities to
contribute significantly to the
college and the community all
year tong.

“Present plans are to award
the trophy first in spring,
1962.”

o

Members of the senior group
emphasized that “this project is

still in the planning stage. We |

haven't made final decisions
about selection of winners; that
will wait until we get a group
of students and faculty together

to discuss it fully and get a wide .

range of ideas.”

Faculty members queried on
the project expressed enthus-
iasm.

President D. Grier Martin.
stated:

“This award should be en-
thusiagtically sought by all
fraternities ... t believe that
it will represent a large step
forward for the Davidson fra-
ternity system.”

Fraternity Liaison Officer
John Kuykendall said, “I am en-
thusiastic about the prospects
for such an award. It is my be-
lief that fraternities . . . are
worthwhile and responsible par:
ticipants in the campus com-
munity, and any recognition
such as this would certainly give
favorable emphasis to the fact.”

Golden To Speak
In Tuesday Chapel

Harry Golden, noted editor
and bumorist, will be a special
guest speaker in student assem-
bly next Tuesday. Golden will
be coming to Davidson directly
from attending the Adolf Eich-
mann trial in Israel.

Golden, a frequent visitor to
the campus, had been scheduled
to come two other times during
the year, but had to change his
plans. For the past month, he
has been covering the Eichmann
trial and connected events for
Life magazine.

Following the assembly,
Golden will be in the College
Union for a coffee hour. He wilt
be available at that time for any
questions on his trip to Israel or
other activities.

At one point, Golden was to
appear on the panel for the
YMCA Book of the Year pro-

| gram in February, which fea-

‘tured a study of Exodus by Leon
Uris. He was called to the west

“We will not have a Con-

President D. Grier Martin
announced to THE DAVID-
SONIAN this week.

“The Board of World Missions
in Nashville tells me that our
missionary group has assigned
ten students — none to Davidson
— for good reasons.” George
Cooley, spokesman for the
board, told President Marti:.
that the two prospective teach-
ers whom the board was consid-
ering sending to Davidson next
year willl study in Switzerland,
where instruction will be carried
on in French. The two men
can get instruction there “with-
out having to worry about lan-
guage difficulties,” Martin said.

“The Board of World Mis-

sions will plan to send one to
us when they have one they
consider qualified.” Oavid-

“We make no pretense about
it,” said Associate Director of
Admissions H. Edmunds White,
“our standards of admission are
becoming increasingly higher.”
He was quick to add, however,
that this is not the result of
any change of policy by the
school, but simply that the ad-
mission office is being flooded
with applicants, and thus must
accept students on a competitive
basis.

Abernathy Misses
In Bid For Mayor

Davidson’s incumbent may-
or, Dr. F. L. Jackson withstood
the political challenge on Jun-
ior Jerry Abernathy at the
polls Tuesday, and swept to
his sixth term in the town’s
top position.

Dr. Jackson, formerly
treasurer of the college, de-
feated Abernathy by 250 votes
to 77. It was the first opposi-
tion Jackson has faced in sev-
eral years. He was appointed
mayor in 1951 and has been
elected every two years since.

Abernathy claimed that his
main purpose in running was
to renew community interest
in its town government. He is
a political science major.

the year learning English here.

“The trustees’ proposal re-
quired that the candidate be
selected by the Board of
World Missions, that he be
Congolese, and that he be
qualified fér admission. For

instance, we couldn‘t take a
Nigerian no matter how well
qualified without the Board's
approval.”

Martin said that the two pros-
pective teachers had planned to
take a summer course in langu-
age training, but he felt this
would not have left them well
enough prepared. “I had urged
them to consider intesifying the

English. language preparation
over there.”

Martin suggested that the
missionary group in the Con-
go might “go on now and pick
out the boys” they want to
send to the United States in

1962 and create a summer
training program.

“I'm disappointed, really,” he
went on, “but it may be for the
best. It gives us longer té as-
similate the idea... I guess I’m
looking for the silver lining in
this...”

"Y' Slates Drives
For Clothing, Books

The YMCA plans to sponsor
a clothing and book drive be-
ginning May 15. Also, beginning
next Monday the “Y” wil con-
duct its spring interest drive.

The clothing will be sent to
Church World Service, which
will distribute it to needy young
men in foreign countries. Shi-
koku College in Japan will re-
ceive the books.

The book drive was instigated
in response to a suggestion by
Arch B. Taylor, Davidson alum-
nus, who is dean of the college.

Boxes will be placed in each
dorm. Any student having ques-
tions about the drive- can con-
sult Jamie Long, director of the
project.

Alec Morgan will head the
spring interest drive. This year
special effort will be made by
the “Y” to insure that each per-
son who signs a card will have
a chance to work in the area
indicated by his interest check.

For 1961-62 Liaison Post.

By LEONARD RICHARDSON
Davidsonian Associate Editor

The college has asked John Kuykendall, ’59, to serve as Fraternity Liaison Officer

again next year, pending a decision b
President D. Grier Martin announced this week. “No final action has been taken,’

Martin. said.

He explained that the college
has put in a request for the one-
year deferment because “‘Kuy-
kendall would be a tremendous
help to the new dean. We realize
the importance of this not only
in relation to the fraternity

system but to the whole of col-

lege life.’ Kuykendall said this
morning that he should know
the Army’s decision next week.

Kuykendall was appointed to
serve as Fraternity Liason Offi-
cer shortly after the faculty de-

{cided to set up the post and post-

pone sophomore rush at their
Dec. 6, meeting.

OTHER ISSUES

In reference to the faculty's
decision to postpone sophomore
rush for one year, Martin ex-
plained that freshman rush will
continue unless the faculty de-
cides to take other action. “It
will not automatically be
brought up at a faculty meeting
... but as you know, any faculty
member has the right to bring
up anything at these meetings.

“My feeling concerning : the
matter,” Martin continued, “is
that the faculty was pleased with
the first experience we had un-
der this new set up, and as far
as I have had any intimations,
the faculty will not be disposed
to change this. If fraternities
continue this fall with programs
like those carried out this spring
— with one or two exceptions
— there will not be a renewed
effort toward sophomore rush
at this time.”

THEFT PROBLEM

“The problem (of thefts) has
become more severe because of
the apparently greater stealing
going on; Martin said in re-
sponse to a question concerning
the increase in reported thefts
on campus. “We would wel-
come creative proposals about
what we could do.”

Martin suggested the possibil-
ity that outsiders are involved.
“The college should try in every
way possible to do away with
this possibility," he added, ex-
plaining that if the Honor Court
finds that outsiders are ‘not re-
sponsible, it can find out who
“in our group” is. He said that
“as far as completed action,”
the college has employed a Sat-

urday night watchman and two

and other times when there are
not: many students on campus.

“Students themselves must be
more alert when they see some-
one they don't recognize in the
dormitories. A person who
comes here ought to be brought
here by some other person who
has responsibility for him. I
don't know at what points you
can make the distinction,” he
added, mentioning the case of a
student who might be visiting
the college.

Martin said that the Student-
Faculty Committee has dis-
cussed the desirability of having
a place in each room where stu-
dents can lock things up. “It
seems to me everybody deserves
the right of privacy and the
right. of security.”

LOCKS DISCUSSED

The committee has discussed
putting locks on the desk draw-

ers in dormitory rooms, and con-

sidered installing compartments
with small padlocks with combi-
nation locks like those in the lo-
¢al post office to avoid the prob-
lem of students losing their
keys.

He said the men on the VPI
track team from whom money
was taken last week will be re-
imbursed, but added, “I don't
think we'd want this to establish
a precedent by any means. It
may encourage miscellancous
people any time they lose some-
thing” to make claims against
the college. Since the college
provides locks on the doors of
dormitory rooms, he does not
think the college would be ne-
cessarily be responsible for
losses.

NEW FACULTY

announce new additions to the
faculty until they are approved
by the Board of Trustees at their
meeting May 18.
