[ With the Alumni|

REUNIONS.

Plans are now under way for the re-
union of several classes at Commence-
ment, and it is hoped that the alumni
will lend their hearty support to those
in charge of working ‘up these gather-
ings of the old classes. According to the
usual custom, the classes especially urged
to have reunions are those in multiples
of five to 1917, that is, the classes of
1912, 1907, 1902, and so on. The clas:
of last year, 1916, it is hoped will also
have a reunion, as customary.

The classes of 1897, 1907 and 1912
are already planning to meet at Com-
mencement. Prof. A. Currie is in charge
of the reunion plans of the class of ’97;
Mr. Scott Candler, of Atlanta, of ’07,
and Mr. J. O. Cobb, of Winston,Salem,
or '12.

FICTION AND ESSAY
CONTEST IS ANNOUNCED

The Fiction and Essay Contests in the
two literary societies close on Saturday,
Apiil 28. By midnight on that date all
contributions must be in the hands of
the presidents.

The length of the essay must be not
less than 1,200 words and not over 3,500
words. The length of the article in the
Fiction Contest is not limited to a cer-
tain number of words. ‘These contribu-
tions are to be handed in under an as-
sumed name. The real name of the au-
thor will not be known by the judge.

The Fiction Contest is inter-society,
and a gold medal will be awarded to
the winner. In the Essay Contest a
medal will be given to the winner in
each separate society. These medals
will be presented at Commencement.

Of late years the number entering
into these contests has not been as great
as it should be. There is no reason why
every man in the two societies should not
enter.

DAVIDSONIAN STAFFS
UNITE AT BANQUET|

On last Friday night a band of nine-
teen, consisting of members of the old
and new Davipsonian Staffs and the
editor-in-chiefs of the Magazine and
Annual, enjoyed a pleasant evening at
the annual Davinsonian Staff banquet.
All thanks are due to Mrs. McMillan
and her faithful helpers who spread the
sumptuous feast which was enjoyed by

Following these speeches were replies

would be hard to make. ‘lhe importan.
feature around which all speeches cen-

GOLF ‘TOURNAMENT
BEGINS NEXT WEEK

The preliminaries in the golf tourna-
ment will begin next week. ‘There will
be five qualifying rounds played. ‘The
four men with the lowest scores will go
to Greensboro to play in the intercol-
legiate contest. Much interest is being
taken in the coming tournament, and |
Davidson is expected to make a good’
showing. ‘The golf links at Davidson
have recently been improved by the ad-
dition of another hole.

One of the most enjoyable social
events of the season was the party given
by Miss Maude Vinson at the home of
her mother, on North Main street, last
Saturday evening, in honor of Misses
Richards, Wiley and Johnson, of Con-
verse College, §. C. The home was
beautifully decorated with many varie-
ties of spring flowers—more than a score
of vases graced the tables and mantels
in the library and the parlor. Among
the guests were Messrs. S. R. Keesler.
E. T. Johnson, J. T. Allen, W. G.
Humphrey, W. P. Keesler, J. B. Daffin,
L. M. Thomas, T. J. Mitchell, W. F.
Hall and J. P. McNeill. Games were
enjoyed until a late hour, when a delic-
ious cream course was served.

and speaker in the Southern Student
Conference, Blue Ridge, N. C.

Blue Ridge Conference is not a place
where abnormally pious fellows go to
soak themselves in an atmosphere drip-
ping with religion. {[f you are that sor
of Righteous Willie, you will not feel
at home there. ‘They would probably
drop you into the swimming pool for
che sheer pleasure of hearing your holy
tones come gurgling up thru the water.

You might justly infer that Blue
Ridge is not permeated by a severe clas-
sic formality. It is a gathering of
friends; four hundred young men, and
a few older men, enjoying themselves
together for ten delightful days. “There
is nothing greater than friendship, and
any possible chance to enter this Blue
Ridge group should be eagerly seized.
This is not a summer resort where you
scrape a shallow acquaintance and pain-
fully converse about the weather or the
rable.

Have you wished that you could share
some of the deeper experiences of sane
and healthy men? Have you wished
that you could get down to something
solid in religion? Have you wished you
could take time to investigate some
things that you have heard vaguely men-
tioned, or touched upon, occasionaliy
but never really explained? Would you
like to ask questions of somebody that
really knows—somebody that is not
afraid to dig into the very heart of things
where you will not shock some good old
soul and be called an infidel just because
you want to examine the evidence and
make sure? Would you like to find out
what method of Bible study and pray-

(2) Get the money. This chance comes
