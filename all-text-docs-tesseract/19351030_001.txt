Bohumir Kryl’s Famous Band
Presents Program of Varied
Selections

SOLO PLAYED BY KRYL

Davidson Band Contributes One
Number To Program

Kryt.and his Symphony Band intro-
duced thesDavidson Concert Series with
a concert on Monday night, Oct. 28,
the auditorium of the college. A

This famous band of approximately
thirty pieces has earned™itself a reputa-
tion in the United States forts remark-
ably fine interpretation of classival music.
lor the past few years it has beenour-
ing the country, averaging more than one
hundred concerts among the colleges and
universities.

The Symphony Band opened its pro-
gram with the overture to the opera
“Bartered Bride,’ by Smetana. In this
piece the woodwind instruments predom-
inated, with the entire band joining in
for the grande finale. This was encored
by “Serenade d'Amour,” by Von Blom.

A harp solo by Miss Ruth ‘Templeman
was the second ‘number, the piece played
being entitled “La Danse Des Sylphes,”
by Godefroid. This was so enthusiasti-
cally-received that the soloist was forced
to play two encores.

Following this came Dvyorak’s familiar
“New World Symphony.” The selection
was the symphony in E minor, consist-
ing of largo and scherzo movements,

Miss Nell Kinard, who has appeared
with ‘the band on its tours, followed the
“Gsew World Symphony” with the aria
for soprano, “Voi Lo Sapete,” from
“Cavalleria Rustincana.” Miss Kinard
sang as an encore the popular French
song, “Parlez Moi d’Amour.”

The last number before the intermis-
sion was a lively piece featured by the
contrast produced. This piece, composed
by Rimsky-Korsakow, was entitled “Ca-

priccio Espagnol.” Following the inter-
mission, Mr. James C. Pfohl, director of
music at the college, conducted the Kryl
band in the introduction to the third act
of “Lohengrin.”

One of the highlights and most appre-
ciated on the program was the
cornet solo played by the director of the
band,: Bohumir Kryl, entitled

items

“Carneval
de Venice.” Kryl reached low notes im-
possible to most cornetists, and managed
to create the illusion during part of the
piece of a cornet duct. The applause of
the audience brought the director back
to the stage, and he played Foster's be-
loved “Old Kentucky Home.”

The eighth number in the concert was
the symphonic suite “Scheherazade,” hy
Rimsky-Korsakow, played by the entire
band. An interesting part of this suite was

Drs. Brown and Cumming, On
the Faculty, Are Honored,

The North Carolina Gamma _ chapter
of Phi Beta Kappa announces the bidding
of two members of the Davidson faculty :
Dr. C. Kk. Brown, professor of Econom-
ics; and Dr. W. P. Cumming, professor
of English. Bids were also offered to
five Davidson alumni namely: Dr. James
Rk. Boulware, Jr., of Lakeland, Mla.; Mfr.
J. . Cassell, Concord; Mr. J. C. Mc-
Caskill, Washington, D,-C.; Dr. J. S.
Brown, Jr., Hendersonville and Mr, A, FP.
Fricker, Birmingham, Michigai.

The Phi Beta Kappa organization was
established in Davidson College in 1922
aiter many years of petitioning to the
national headquarters. Before the char-
ter of the organization was granted, the
members of the Student Body, who were
interested in scholastic work, organized
a society Called the Mimir Society. ‘This
organization Was under the supervision
of Dr. J. M. MeConnell and was run on
the same basis as the Phi Beta Kappa
society now.

The Mimir society had many members
at the time when the national charter
was granted and when the first bidding
came about the number of members Was
too great to enable all men to receive the
honor, Thus at the end of the year many
of the men who were the instigators of
the fraternity were left without being
bid due to their graduation.

The organization now is taking in
these men who have had something to
do with the Mimir Society and have not
been bid to Phi Beta Kappa.

The recent bidding of these alumni
have been taken on the merits that were
given to them through their work with
the Mimir Society. Also these men were
given bids at the same time of the other
students who were given bids last week
but due to mixup with other honorary
fraternity biddings

New Sewage Plant
Attracts Interest

City Installs Experimental Dis-
posal System

The town of Davidson has led the na-
tion in the installation of a revolutionary
new type of: sewage disposal plant, re-
placing the one which has been in use for
a number of years. The old one proved
inadequate when the college abandoned
its own plant above the golf course and
connected with the town’s system.

When the old plant was condemned
hy the board of health, the town made a
contract with the Bio Reduction Corpora-
tion for the new equipment. This Brook-
lyn company, since it plans to use Da-
vidson’s plant for demonstration pur-
poses, made the town a price which is
just one-third of the actual cost of the
installation, completed last
week. The contract provides for the use
of the plant during a sixty-day trial pe-
riod, after which it will be taken out at
the company’s loss if it does not prove
satisfactory, and if it does not prove
of the

which was

the approval and state
health boards.

A unique feature of this method of
disposal is that the residue, which analy-
sis has shown to have a value of from
six to twleve dollars per pound as ferti-
lizer, is not wasted, but is used for this
purpose. It was planned to begin use of
the-plant, which employs the same pipes
as the old one, with an extension to the
new place of disposal, during the first
part of this week.

FIRST R.0.T.C. PARADE IS HELD

The initial parade of the year was held

WILDCATS AND BULLDOGS
TIE IN GAME FEATURED,
BY SPECTACULAR PLAYS

‘

Hall Contributes 65-Yard Touch-
down Jaunt As Citadel
Ties Davidson

PITTMAN LEADS ’CATS

Lafferty Skirts End For Wildcats’
Lone Touchdown

A fighting team of Wildcats smashed
the Citadel Bulldogs relentlessly Satur-
day afternoon on Richardson Vield, but
the final whistle found the score dead-
locked, 7-7, These teams also tied last
year at Charleston.

Davidson, led by versatile Paul Pitt-
man, threatened after time, but
found the going too tough inside the
Bulldog’s 25 to convert their drives into
touchdowns. Their lone score came after
Pittman returned a Citadel punt from his
own 45 to Citadel's 14, when Lafferty
on a reverse around his own left end
scored standing up. Citadel's score came
on a double reverse from Ferguson to
McCreadie to Hall, who raced 65 yards
to score untouched. Yarborough, Cathey,
Pittman, Lafferty, and Williams led the
‘Cats; while Hall, McCreadie, Ferguson,
Miller, and Captain Lowe were outstand-
ing for the Bulldogs. A brief summary

time

of each quarter is as follows:

FIRST QUARTER

Miller kicked off to Pittman who re-
turned to his 15. After gaining 3 yards,
Pittman broke loose around end for 25
yards. Following an exchange of punts,
lafferty dashed off tackle for 15 yards
before stepping out of bounds, The ball
see-sawed up and down the field with no
outstanding gains until Pittman heaved
Williams a pass good for 13 yards. Da-
vidson threatened again as Pittman re-
turned McCreadie’s punt to Citadel’s 38.
After two short gains Pittman passed
and Miller intercepted for Citadel on
his own 35. McCreadie punted out of
bounds on Davidson’s 4, and Pittman
booted a beautiful return punt of 60
yards to the Bulldog’s 35 as the quarter
ended.

SECOND QUARTER
Citadel's offense was bottled up by the

fast charging ‘Cat forwards, and Me-
Creadie kicked to Verble who was
downed on Davidson's 18. Pittman got

11 yards around end and kicked to Cita-
de!'s 37 where Henry Cathey made the
tackle. On a reverse from Ferguson to
McCreadie to Hall, Hall raced 65 yards
through a broken field for the first score.
McCreadie’s placement try hit the up-
rights but bounded through for the extra
point. After punt
Pittman received a punt on his own 45
and returned to Citadel's 14. From this
point, on the first play Lafferty raced
14
and a touchdown. Pittman converted the
try for extra point. After
smashes at Davidson's line Citadel kicked
to Pittman who was downed on his 40

Tryouts For Debating
Team Will Be Soon

Preliminary plans for the debating
trips to be made in the early spring have
been formulated by the Forensic coun-
cil, Tryouts will be held as scheduled,
on November the fifteenth.

The tentative plans are that there will
be five debates on each of the three trips.
One trip will be made to Florida, and
will return through Georgia. The west-
ern trip will go to Tennessee and Ken-
tucky through West Virginia and the
Shenandoah Valley. The northern tour
will go to Washington but no farther
than Philadelphia

It has been definitely decided that each
team will debate both sides of any ques-
tion, and probably aj secondary question
will be added fo the Pi Delta Alpha
question.

Material for the tryouts has been
moved to room six in the library. The
faculty committee on debating headed by
Dr. C. K. Brown met last week and. ap-
