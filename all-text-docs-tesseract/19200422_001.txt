Vigilance Committee In-
augurated By Student
Council

Freshmen Restrictions to Be Rigorous-
ly Enforced. Hereafter New Men
Will Receive Parental Care.

Last fall the Student Council was
at odds to know how to solve the
problem of hazing, which was con-
tinuously going on. This was against
the rules of the student body, but it
could not be stopped. Finally the
Soph class came to the rescue. They
suggested the idea of Fresh caps,
and it was voted as an amendment
to the constitution that Freshmen
should be required to wear a cap,
but since that time things have been
running along in a slipshod way.
Some of the Freshmen have been
going around as if they owned the
campus, wearing caps when they so
desired and taking all the privileges
of upper class men. But the Stu-
dent Council has at last hit upon a

lan that is going to solve the prob-
em. The students voted on and
passed the amendment to the con-
stitution that all Freshmen will be
required to wear a black cap with a
red button on top and a green F just
above the bill. Frese caps are to be
worn all the time except when in
full uniform, when the service hat
must be worn. He must wear his
cap while playing golf and to and
from the tennis courts. Upon leav-
ing the hill the cap is to be worn to
and from the train.

Two weeks from entering college
the class must know all the college
yells and songs, and will be given an
examination on same at the end of
two weeks. All first year men must
sit in their seats at chapel until the
isles are cleared of upper classmen,
and must sit together at athletic
games on the hill.

In order that the new rules may
be enforced a vigilance committee
has been appointed from the stu-
dent body. This consists of ten men
from the Senior class, five from the
Junior class and five from the Soph
class. It is the duty of the mem-
bers of this committee to see that
these rules are rigidly enforced
There will be a regular meeting of

time a letter in track. Sutton also
added another letter to his collection
by taking the first place in the dis-
cus throw. Fricker, the star miler,
had the misfortune to be pitted
against a second Brand in the per-
son of Blakeney, who sprinted the
four laps and then wondered when

Kraft was next with a first and

with two seconds. Pell and Albright
secured five apiece, Pell taking a
first and Albright two seconds, but
one was disputed with Brice. Ernst
and Lawrence took a second apiece.
While their average individual scor-
ing was larger than Davidson’s, yet
they had no Murrays to help bring
up the grand total.

The track team is to be congratu-
lated on their fine work. They have
done what the other D. C. athletic
teams fail to do, that is defeat State
College. 5

Can you afford to miss Blue Ridge?

If you have a friend in the infirm-
ary don’t forget him. Go down ev-
ery now and then and cheer him up
a bit, and don’t forget that sick folks
crave candy and “sodas” same as
when they are well.

Location of Blue Ridge

To one who has been to Blue
Ridge either for a conference or on
some other visit it is useless to tell
of the beauty of the place or of its
ideal location. No place better suit-
ed for this center of Christian train-
ing and inspiration could be found
in the whole country. It is in the

heart of the Blue Ridge mountains

Blue Ridge Conference June 15th to 24th.
Davidson to Have Large Delegation

Delegates of Last Year Express Their Views on the Various Activities of
Blue Ridge. Every Man Urged to Go That Can Do So.

If you
once go you feel for the fellows that
are unable to be there.

A spirit of helpfulness and good
fellowship pervades the air. In all
the things taking place in the form
of contests a spirit of friendly ri-
valry exists.

Again it might be said that the
Blue Ridge spirit is one of unselfish-
ness. The general atmosphere is a

very buildings are on the side of a
mountain and are in easy hiking
distance of such celebrated peaks as
Greybeard and Mt. Mitchell. Blue
Ridge may easily be reached by rail
from any point in the south. It is
only two miles from Black Moun-
tain and four from Montreat, the
famous summer resort. Automo-
bile parties leave almost every aft-
ernoon for such points of interest
as Biltmore and Chimney Rock. If
you have never been to the moun-
tains you most certainly ought to
go; if you have been once you will
need no urging to go again.

Some time ago a gentleman in
speaking of the Davidson spirit,
said: “You feel like you are sorry
for the fellows that have to go to
other colleges.” This is something of

fine and congenial one. Let every
man do his best to go to Blue Ridge
so that he too will be able to bring
back to old Davidson some of the
genuine Blue Ridge spirit when he
returns next fall.

Blue Ridge the Place to Take

Inventory

Nothing great has ever been ac-
complished without being planned
in some quiet, solitary. place. Paul
in the desert of Arabia, Moses in the
wilderness are classic examples.
Blue Ridge offers a man a chance to
turn aside and take stock of him-
self. There on the hilltops, sur-
rounded by the grandeur of nature,
he can look into himself and ask
“What sort of a chap am I, any-
way?” A sincere examination of
one’s self is the beginning of useful-

EXAMINATION SCHEDULE FOR SPRING TERM. Baptists Bow Before Bend-

ers of Buck Currie
Presbyterians Swamp Wake Forest

12 to 1. Visitors Unable to
Banch Their Hits.

Davidsin proved that it was still
in the running for the state cham-
pionship when Coach Hengeveld’s
proteges took the long end of a 12
to 1 score against the strong Wake
Forest aggregation. The Wildcats
got the largest per cent of its tal-
lies in the first three frames, knock-
ing two pitchers out of the box. The
Presbyterians ran wild on the bases
twice scoring from second on bunts.

Slow fielding and many errors by
the visitors marred the game and
until the fourth inning, when Barnes
mounted the box, it resembled a
track meet. “Lefty” Austin, the first
moundsman, retired in favor of
Griffin in the second inning after
seven runs had been scored, but the
offerings of the new pitcher looked
the same and in the third inning
four more runs were added.

Wake Forest’s only run came, in
the initial session, when Kesler
scored on an error of Duncan’s slow
grounder. The features of the game
were the fielding of Poe in right
field and the way in which Currie
pitched himself out of the pinches.
Poe made two sensational catches,
one time running far outside of the
foul line and pulling down one that
looked impossible; the other time
he slipped down on the wet earth
but grabbed the pill and held it.
Three times did Wake Forest fill
the bases only to be disappointed.
The necessary bingle was not forth-
coming and not one of these men
scored, Every inning except the
second the losers put men on base,
and that is where they stayed until
there were three down.

The scoring was as follows:

Wake Forest scored in the first.
Jenette opened by drawing a pass.
He was forced by Kesler at second,
but Rapsdale was hit and Kesler ad-
vanced. Then Duncan rapped out a
grounder which was muffed and
Kesler scored. Davidson’s tallies
came in the first, second, third and
sixth. In the first Ratchford walk-
ed but was forced out at second by
Cassell. Shepard saw first on an
error and Richards received free
transportation thereby filling the
hassocks. Wrenn hit one to the
