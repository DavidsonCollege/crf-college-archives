That game Saturday was a corker from
the standpoint of the disinterested spec-
tator, but to a Davidson man it was a
good ticket to the “bug-house.” Time
and again it seemed that the Wildcats
were going to turn defeat into victory, but
every time Lady Luck or something step-
ped in to turnt he tide away from the red
and black eleven.

We say luck played a part, but
this guy Duvall didn’t seem to de-
pend on any charms except his
feet. He is one good runner. His
style is much like that of a certain
Rackley of Wake Forest, who is
well known around Davidson. Aft-
er seeing Duvall, the “Happy War-
rior,” as the Charleston papers
term him, break loose four or five
times right through the middle of
the Wildcat defense everybody was
willing to grant that the was
“ready” as they ever get. Duvall
has certainly put the Citadel on
the map this season.

To this writer, the tarning point of the
game came about through an unfortunate
decision by Referee Cheves. Brock
punted to Citadel’s 49-yard line. A Cita-
del player attempted to pick up the ball
and run, but failed in this, after touching
the ball several times. Meanwhile Harper
and Smith, of the Wildcats, were on him
and Harper fell on the pigskin, clearly
giving first down to the ’Cats, since the
ball became free after the Citadel man
touched it. The referee, however, ruled
that the ball belonged to Citadel, and no
amount arguing could bring him
around. On the next play, Duvall broke
away for 48 yards, placing the ball on
Davidson's two-yard marker.

of

Breaks will come, though. The
first Wildcat score was the direct
result of a fumble, Brock scooping
it up and sprinting over the goal
line. There four red jersies right
behind him to see it well done.

Citadel’s ‘interference was a smooth
working part of their attack. It looked
like a wave of blue jersies swept com-
pletely over the secondary defense of the
Wildcats whenever Duvall or Howie
started one of their slashing runs. The
absence of Flinn and Black played havoc
with the 'Cat defense during the second
half. Had those two boys been in, the
result might have been different.

Not all the ‘fireworks were fur-
nished by the Cadets, though. Bob
Kell played the greatest game of
his career at Davidson. He was
a sure ground gainer and a deadly
tackler. Many times he shot off
tackle or around end for substan-
tial gains, and his fifty yard dash
after taking a pass at the opening
of the last half was a highlight of
the game. Thad Brock did about
everything but carry water and he
did it well. Keep your eyes on that
boy. He is‘one of Carolina’s com-
ing luminaries. Riggs McConnell
and Baker did fine work in the
line, as did Sam Smith. It was a
dogged fight that those weary
Wildcats put up in the closing
minutes of the game. Only a des-
perate stand by the Davidson line
averted another Citadel touch-
down.

The Wake Forest game is Da-
vidson’s bow into the Big Five.
Little can be said as to prospects
for this clash. Neither team has

won startling victories, but both have
made excellent stands against sup-
posedly stronger teams. Tradi-
tion has decreed that there shall
always be a fight when Deacon
and Wildcat get together, so the
game in Charlotte Saturday should
be supremely satisfying.

Power to the Wildkittens for their
slashing win over Wofford. That helps
to avenge the varsity’s defeat by the little
Terriers’ older brothers. Monk is going
to get some good men off that frosh
squad.

Monk Younger and the Davidson Wild-
cats found out one more time that these
Sandlapper schools are not to be trifled
with in the least. Last Saturday-witness-~
ed about the most hectic f6otball game of
the season, as the Citadel Cadets played
host to the ’Cats at Charleston. Before
a crowd of some thirty-five hundred peo-
ple, the Soldiers maneuvered their fast

backs until the ‘Cats were groggy, and
after an hour of tactics like this, the Bull- |
dogs marched away with four touchdowns |
and the game, leaving a battered but still
scrapping Davidson team to console itself, |
It was the first time since the téams have |
been playing that the Soldiers were vic- |
torious.

Davidson starte doff like a steam roller
with wings, crushing the Cadets back
'toward their goal line, and within seven
or eight minutes of play the ’Cats placed
the oval on Citadel’s four-yard line. Here,
however, the Cadets took a brace and
stopped Black as he tried for first down.
Davidson soon renewed her drive, forcing
jthe ball to the enemy’s 30-yard mark.
Citadel held. On the first play a Cadet
back fumbled, the ball rolling to the 18-
yard line. Brock was on it like a flash,
recovered and sprinted the distance across
the last white line.
for point.

He missed his try

Now the big guns of the Cadets began
to function, and following a recovery of
a punt, Duvall, speedy and elusive quar-
terback for the Soldiers, ran the ball 38
yards to the two-yard mark. Howie took
it over and kicked the extra point. A
few plays later, this same Duvall, ap-
parently unstoppable, wormed and dodged
| his way through a broken field 69 yards
for another score.

As the final half began, the Wildcats
looked good to pull the game out of the
fire. Within one minute of the whistle,
Kell had snagged a pass and crossed the
line after a dash of 47 yards, Again
Brock missed point. Citadel, not to be de-
nited, came back with slashing off tackle
plays and passes that confounded the fast
tiring Wildcats, and Duvall again climax-
ed this drive with a fine sprint for 34
yards and a touchdown. Howie drove
around end for the last score of the con- |
test.

Davidson threatened until the last, once
taking the pigskin to the 36-yard line,
| where a bad pass from center spoiled her
|hopes. Davidson made a fine stand on
her own four-yard line to hold the charg-
ing Cadets as the game came to its close,

Duvall was the big noise for Citadel,
but he was ably abetted by a line which
| gave excellent interference, and charged
| hard enough to take the Wildcats out of
|his way. Kell played a beautiful game
| for Davidson. He ran well and tackled

hard. Brock was-a thorn in Citadel's of -
| fense. Captain Baker and Riggs McCon- |
/nell were towers of strength in the line. |

Wildkittens under the tutelage of
“Buck” Miles invaded the lair of the Lit-

varsity by a 20-0 win. The Kittens pre-

scores.

Wofford’s tackles played well in the
line for the losers. Ross and Moore were
in the thick of every scrimmage and made
it hot on both offense and defense. Wil-
lis, the left half for the Terriers, played
a good all-round game.

Davidson's first score came about the
middle of the first quarter when Goodson
broke loose from the center of the field
and romped over the goal line. He kicked
goal for the extra point. The second
score of the game came after a series of
passes, the last to King, who put the ball
within scoring distance. Goodson took the
ball over and then kicked the extra point.
The final markér came in the third period
after the Wildkittens had marched to the
four-yard line and R, Bradshaw took it
over, Goodson failed to kick goal.
