Fraternities Act To Remove Racial Discrimination Rules

By ED EMBREE
St-f* Writer

All out one of Davidson's so-
cizl fraternities have complied
with the Board of Trustees’
anti-discriminatory clause.

Official compliance with the
clause, due Sept. 1, has been
Yeceived from the naticnal or-
ganizations of 11 fraternities.

The remaining fraternity is
expected to comply in the near
future, reported Fraternity Li-
aison Officer Tom Covington.

Covington said that the sole
delay has been caused by the
illness of one of the top na-
tional fraternity officers who
has not been available to sign
the necessary statement.

The Faculty Committee on
Fraternities, Clubs and Social
Life, acting on the recommen-
dation of a Student Council
Fraternity Evaluation Commit-
tee of students and faculty,
proposed to the faculty meet-
‘ing of April 13, 1965 the ac-
ceptance of a clause which
Stated that fraternities would
have to give official satisfac-

tion to the college by Sept. 1.
1966 under penalty of removal
from campus that all David-
son students are eligible for
initiation,

Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts reported that the clause
was the outgrowth of the Stu-
dent Council committee which
recommended the clause in
both the majority and minor-
ity reports to the faculty com-
mittee.

In December of 1964, as the
faculty was studying the -re-
port, the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill took
similar action with its frater-
nities.

Dean Burts stated that ‘‘the
Carolina action probably had
some bearing on the faculty
action. We would have done it
anyway, but it did give us
support in our action.”

Following faculty approval
of the clause. the Board of
Trustees also passed the clause
‘with little dissent that I know
of."’ said Burts.

Dr. W. F. Workman. chair-

man. of the faculty committee
which studied the proposal,
stated that the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 probably did not
change anyone's opinion, al-
though the civil rights move-
ment probably did influence
some of the faculty.

When asked what prompted
the initial student-faculty rec-
ommendation, Burts respond-
ed that there were two fac-
tors. “I seems to be a ‘sign
of the times’ with college and
universities from all parts of
the nation requiring such
compliances from their frater-
nities. Also Davidson was
concerned with the problem
of admitting students who
did not have the opportunity
to fully partake of all the bene-
fits of Davidson College life.”

Covington stated that all the
fraternities have been very co-
operative in complying with
the clauses. ‘Generally alum-
ai on the national level,"’ he
said, ‘have resisted such
changes while the active ehap-
ters have genuinely tried to

adapt to changes.”

Although the Davidson alum-
ni were active in the frater-
nity question in 1965, there has
not been any reaction to this
specific clause.

Bill Kendrjck, president, of
Kappa Sigma, stated that his
fraternity has never had a dis-
criminatery clause but that
all initiates of the fraternity
have to be “acceptable to in-
itiated members of the chap-
ters.”

Vince Foster explained that
the same “‘socially accept-
able” clause applies to Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. Foster said
that the only discrimination in
the history of the fraternity
was in its early years when
the discrimination was direct-
ed toward “Yankees.”

Sigma Phi Epsilon Presi-
dent Scott Gabrielson stated
that until five years ago there
was no written discriminatory
clause in the national consti-
tution but there was a “‘strong-
ly suggested’’ discriminatory
practice. However since 1960

there has been no written or
informal clause.

Tom Brown, president of Pi
Kappa Alpha, stated. that in
1961 the fraternity repealed
the white clause in the ccasti-
tution which left the fraternity
with no discriminatory claus-
es. He reported that the change
‘was made ih anticipation of
administrative pressure on lo-
eal chapters.

Joel Williamson, president
of Sigma Chi, reported that his
fraternity has never had a dis-
criminatory clause regarding
race, religion or national or-
igin although the national fra-
ternity officers. the alumni
and active members have “the
privilege of balling any mem-
ber of the fraternity.”

Phi Delta Theta President
Brooks Sheldon stated that
until 1964 the only clause was
one of ‘social acceptability.”
At the °64 convention a ‘‘waiv-
er bylaw” was passed to al-
low chapters under pressure
to comply with administration
demands.

The Davidson Phi Delt chap-
ter received notice of a waiv-
er which implies local auton-
omy. At the 1966 convention
this socially acceptable clause
was voted out and with another
similar vote at the next con-
vention the clause will be
completely eliminated.

In a prepared statement
from the national office, the
Kappa Alpha Order stated that
it amended its constitution, to
allow the Davidson Chapter
“to select its members with-
out discrimination as to race,
religion or national origin.

Sigma Nu at Davidson has
been freed from its national
discriminatory clause by a
“Membership Qualifications
Waiver with Honor’ stated
Jim Rostan, president. Rostan
added that he has been assur-
ed by his naticnal offices that
no pressure will be applied to
adhere to the national clause.

At the 1966 convention of
Sigma Nu a motion by the
Duke chapter to completely
delete the clause was defeated

by a slim majority. As a re-
sult both the Duke and Bowl.
ing Green chapters‘are in dan-
ger of suspension by their re-
spective administrations.

Pi Kappa Phi ‘‘has complete
freedom to select members
without regard to race, religion
or creed,” quoted Paul Curlee,
president, from a leter. to the
college.

Heretofore the Davidson
chapter had a waiver from the
national discrimination.clause,
but this clause was repealed
unanimously in the 1966 gen-
eral convention. .Curlee. stated
that, faced with the loss of
26 out of 55 chapters due to
administration pressures, ini-
tial opposition from Southern
chapters to the proposal was
overcome. .

Beta Theta Pi Vice-President
Johnny Jeter reported that
“to his recollection” the fra-
ternity has aever had a dis-
criminatory clause and has
had no problems concerning
this question.

Julian Fite, president of Phi

Gamma Delta, stated that his
fraternity used to be restrict-
ed to Caucasion persons of
Christian persuasion, byt the
only restriction now is that the
National Executive Council
has to pass on all pledges.

Approximately one fourth of
the chapters have been grant-
ed dispensations when the
school requires it, which puts
the chapters (including the Da-
vidson chapter) in a situation
of “‘local autonomy.”

Alpha Tau Omega President
Gary Devane stated that the
1966 general convention com-
pletely deleted the white-Chris-
tian clause from its constitu-
tion, giving each chapter local
autonomy regarding member-
ship.

Devane reported that a third
of the chapters would have
been ‘kicked off campus" if
the constitution had not been
changed. Over half of the
Southern chapters voted for the
change while the chapters in
the Midwest were generally
opposed to the change.

Teaching studeats who at first
Strongly objected to the lecture-
discussion method of instruction
was one of the many experiences
recalled by Davidson Econom.
ics Professor Charles E. Ratliff
Jr. of his past three years in
Pakistan.

Ratliff. who had been asked

was a Christian missionary and,
a professor of economics at For-
man College in Lahore. Pakis-
tan.

His main purpose was to help
set up MA courses in econom-
ics at Forman, which is an affil-
jated college of the University of
Punjab. Besides teaching cours-
es, he also advised students,
performed research. wrote ar-
ticles for publication and gave
lectures at the Finance Service

Academy.

“I was pleasantly surprised,”
commented Ratliff, ‘‘that as a
foreign missionary, I had the op-
portunity to do so many differ-
ent things. I was, however. some-
what distressed at the lack of
motivation among the students.
I guess I went there with the
naive idea that students in un-
derdeveloped countries would be
highly motivated.

“Most boys with a chance for
higher education."’ he continued,
“come from a very privileged.

wealthy class of people. Since

81 per cent of the people in Pak-
istan are illiterate and few get
even a secondary school educa-
tion, there is little way to sift
through the boys and pick the
most intelligent for college work.

“The students were unfamiliar
with the lecture-discussion meth-

od of teaching and at first ob-
jected strongly. They were used
to memorizing facts and giving
them back on tests. At the last,
however, they began to realize
that I was trying to teach them
to think and appreciated it
greatly.”

The high spot of his trip, he
explained, was a seminar on ec-
onomic and commercial develop-
ment sponsored by the Method-
ist Agricultural Extension Serv-
ice and the Catholic Church.
People from USAID (a govern-
ment agency), from private
foundations, from the Peace
Corps and from various church
groups discussed what each is
doing to help the economic prog-
ress of Pakistan. This discus-
sion enabled each group to un-
derstand the work and ideas of
the others.

Although foreigners are not al-
lowed to teach Bible courses in
the Islam-dominated country,

Dr. Ratliff was allowed to hold

a voluntary chapel. ‘On many
other occasions,” he added,
“students would come to me
with questions about Christian-

‘Ity. In this way I was able to

help many students understand
our basic religious beliefs.”

Commenting cn his stay, Rat:
liff said, '’I received more bene-
fit than I gave, I am sure, both
professionally, individually and
religiously. It was both an inter-
esting and a profitable experi-
ence. The people there made us
feel very much at home and in-
vited us to come back.”’
