Friday, September 25, 1987 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Davidson welcomes: new faculty members from home and abroad

By MARGARET CARROL and
PETE MANGONE

Dr. Monique Guizard

Dr. Monique Guizard, a visi-
ting professor from Paul Valery
University in Montpellier, joins
the French department this year.

Dr. Gujzard received her doc-
torate in educational psychology
and is a specialist in audio visual
methods of teaching languages.
Although she normally teaches at
Paul Valery University, she has
also taught in Japan over previous
summers and hopes to teach one
day in Iceland and Norway.

Guizard has published two
books on methods of teaching
French and a book of French verbs
and their use with prepositions.

Despite an a contract offer to

teach in China, Guizard chose to °

- come back to Davidson after hav-

ing taught here before in 198}..

While at Davidson, she will teach
French 11 and French 100.

Dr. Guizard is very interested
in music, theatre, cinema, and
dance, in which she participates in
an international troupe with some
students in France. She also at-
tends aerobics class three times a
’ week at the YMCA, saying that
she needs to have exercise in order
to be “dynamic” in class.

‘Dr. Guizard brought her 85-
year-old mother to Davidson for

her first experience travelling *

abroad, and she left behind her
husband, son, and _ grandson.
Guizard will return to France in
February, but she loves Davidson
and especially Davidson students,
who she says, “are marvelous, in-
telligent, serious. and — at
times — humorous.” :

taught at Davidson three years ago
and at July Experience two years
ago. Originally from Elkin, North
Carolina, Raynal lives in David-
son now with her husband and two
sons.

Raynal graduated from UNC- ©

G in 1968, and she received her
masters from Southeastern
Louisiana University in 1978. She
has a one year appointment at
Davidson, where she will be

teaching English 21 and writing |

for international students.

Although she never imagined
that she would end up teaching
writing, she thoroughly enjoys her
work. She also loves American
and British literature.

’ Every summer, Mrs. Raynal
spends a great deal-of time or-
ganizing an annual summer trip
for the youth in the community.
During the past three years, the
groups have taken two week trips
to Nova Scotia, Big Ben National
Park, and Rocky Mountain Na-

tional Park. The kids do a service
project in addition to their travel-
ling.

Mrs. Raynal likes teaching at

Davidson, where she enjoys both

professional and personal re-
lationships with students.

Mr. John Haskell
A Davidson graduate of the
class of 1981, Mr. John Haskell
has ‘returned to Davidson for a
year to be a guest lecturer while he

“completes his doctoral disserta-

tion at UNC-CH.

Although Haskell was born in
Cleveland, Ohio, he has lived in
North Carolina since his family
moved to Chapel Hill. Haskell
graduated from Davidson with a
political science major and then
received his masters from UNC-
Chapel Hill in the fall of 1985. He
also taught at Chapel Hill for two
years as a graduate student.

Haskell currently teaches two
political science courses, Parties

.grade teacher,

and Interest Groups (POL 120)
and the Legislative Process (POL
121).

Outside the classroom, Has-
kell enjoys basketball, tennis, and
reading novels. Although some-
what biased toward Davidson stu-
dents, Haskell notes that they are
“extremely perceptive, and they
participate a great deal in class.”

To help make up for the loss of
the Professor Sutton husband and
wife duo to the Montpellier, Fr-
ance JYA program this year, the
French department has added the
dynamic teaching abilities of Pro-
fessor Carole Stitt. Originally
from New York, she is presently a
Ph.D. candidate at Duke Univer-
sity and is working on her disser-
tation conceming ‘the political
speeches of Victor Hugo.

Stitt’s interest in French, she
says, must be credited to her third
“a real fran-
cophilic.” Stitt recalls that her
teacher used to have French

seiisiaieante everywhere in the

classroom. She also used to teach
the elementary students to sing
French songs and exposed them to
bits of French history. As she
looks back, Stitt realizes that this
teacher’s impression on_ her
helped steer her in the direction of
French studies. Eventually these
studies led to her spending a year
in Paris as the assistant resident of
Duke University’s program in Fr-
ance. In this capacity, she spent
time at the University of Paris 7
helping to organize American stu-
dents’ efforts to register for class-
es (a hectic, confusing, and some-
times physically harmful activity
there),

' During her first term at David-
son, Stitt is teaching what she
feels is the most enjoyable of
classes, beginning French. This
enjoyment arises from the oppor-

_ tunity these two classes give her to

share her knowledge of French
with students who are experienc-
ing something totally new in their
life.” Succinctly, she states it is a
process of “group discovery.”
When not teaching or correct-
ing papers, Stitt likes to spend
time with her husband, who like
herself is an avid sailor. They
often spend one day of the
weekend on Lake Norman in their
sailboat, enjoying the relaxing
and yet exciting moments that
sailing offers. In addition to recre-
ational sailing, Stitt and her hus-
band compete in regattas and even
came home with a couple. of
trophies this past summer.

Professor Stitt is definitely a
welcome addition to the Davidson
faculty. As an innovative, fun,
and caring professor, she undoub-
tedly brings with her the qualities
of Davidson’s faculty that make
Davidson College such a fine
school.

SGA discusses new dorms and mandatory parking fees

By ROBERT SMALLEY

Last Tuesday night, the
SGA convened. its first senate
meeting of the new school year.

SGA _ President Conrad
Doenges began the meeting by
announcing the upcoming sen-
ate elections for freshmen and
Patterson Court houses. He
urged anyone who is interested
in running for these seats to sign
up in the Dean of Students’ Of-
fice before September 22.

The senate discussed the
construction site of the new
apartment-style dormitories.
Because of water drainage
problems similar to those which
have affected several Patterson
Court houses, Director of Facil-
ities Planning Grover Meetze is
hesitant to locate the new dorms
in the wooded area between the
soccer and baseball fields.

Instead, Meetze favors put-
ting the dorms where the Belk
parking lot is currently located.

To make up for lost parking , the
satellite lot located near Irwin
_ dormitory would be extended

toward Lingle Manor.

A final option would be to
construct the dorms beyond
Akers and Irwin, which would
afford them a degree of quiet
and seclusion. The senate des-
ires and encourages students to
voice their opinions on the site
selection as soon as possible.
Construction will begin soon so
that the dorms should be com-
pleted by next fall.

Regarding the new parking
fee, the senate discussed how
the fee came about and whether
it was necessary. Most senators
agreed that a small fee was ac-
ceptable but were shocked to
learn that it was $30. Doenges
assured the senate that the re-
ceipts of the fee would be ear-
marked to improve parking.

A larger problem the senate
discussed was the apparant lack
of communication between the
administration.and the students
on matters such as those dis-
cussed at the meeting. The sen-
ate hopes to to reestablish open

"lines of communication — be-

tween the administration and
the student body and welcomes
student suggestions on the mat-
ter.

This past Tuesday, the senate
began its second weekly meet-
ing of the year with a reminder
that senate elections will be held
in the coming week. All up-

perclassmen are encouraged to
vote for house senators, and

freshmen are urged to vote for —

class senators. Voting will be

held this Tuesday, September

29, from 9:00 to 3:00 in the lob-
bies of Chambers and the
Union.

The senate again discussed
the proposed sites of the new
dormitories. The administration

- is considering two sites: the

_ Belk parking lot and the area be-
hind Irwin and Akers. The SGA
has been assured that if the Belk
lot is used, more parking areas
will be constructed prior to the
closing of the present lot in the
wooded area behind Lingle
Manor. Although a final deci-
sion has yet to be made, the col-

lege hopes to have the matter
settled within the next three
-weeks. All students are urged to
let members of the SGA know
their feelings on this matter.
The senate also heard from
representatives from the carrier-
current radio station project and
approved their statement of pur-
pose. The Activities Tax Coun-
cil has allotted $250 for the pro-
ject and the senate will be

cooperative in any way it can.
The group was encouraged to
write a constitution and present
it for senate approval.
Finally, students are asked
to review the proposed
academic calendar for next
year. Senators would like to
gauge student reaction. All
opinions should be directed to
Conrad Doenges or the faculty
executive committee.
