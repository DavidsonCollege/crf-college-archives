A “Native son” was freshie bowers,
He hurried through the passing hours;
Now he can’t smell the pretty flowers,
He hossed too many Sophomores.

Byloo fast, they say, for a college town;

He's sleeping now, so long and sound,
He hossed too many Sophomores.

A snappy young fellow, fresh mequeen,
The classiest thing the town has seen;
His face looks toward the grass so green,
He hossed too many Sophomores.

Then at last was fresh caldwell,
He did not care what he did tell;
He's gone from here, he went -well,
He hossed too many Sophomores.
