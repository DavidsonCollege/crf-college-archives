Press Undoes Hoopsters
For Poor Vacation Mark

By YATES FAISON
Assistant Sports Editor
An Analysis and Review

Several weeks ago a battle-tested core of Wolverines with 11 minutes to pre-
vent a wipe-out frantically hastened together a sticky, double-teaming full-court
press and down went the ‘Cats. And despite the efforts of Coach Lefty Driesell to
combat this illness, not much has gone right ever since.

Getting the lead has not since been the problem for the Legions. It has just been
a matter of time. In numerous instances. 30 minutes of good ball was short-circuited
by 10 of hesitancy and indecision. Since the VMI game of Dec. 13, four of the Wild-
cats’ five losses could and should have been victories.

TIGERS TOO TOUGH
First is was giantkilling
Princeton. Although the ‘Cats
made a prolonged attempt at
the end of the first half and the
start of the second to get back
‘in ‘the ball game, here was per
haps the only game the Wild-

cats should have. dropped.
Outshot, outrebounded. out
hustled and outplayed. Davidson
found itself down by as much as
18 points after a John Haarlow
jumper with 6:33 left in the firs:
half made it 3517. The Wild
cats managed to close the half

time gap to 4132 with a 15-6.

spurt led by newly found Mike
O'Neill. who canned four
straight jumpers after being in
serted into the lineup for Tom
Youngdale.

With Wayne Huckel waging an
assault against the Coliseum
floor to come up with the ball
and O'Neill endearing himself
to the fans with another two
straight from the outside. the
‘Cats closed to within two points
of the Tigers at 53-51. but here
the difference became plain. The
necessary ingredient was poise
and the Ivy Leaguers had as
much as or more than _ the
Wildcats proved they lacked.

The first-half nightmare ma-
terialized once more and before
long. lonely Princeton fans
were yelling. ‘Go for 30." The
clock was merciful. Had it run
longer. it would have probably
been worse than 91-68. Ed Hum-
mer led the scoring for Prince-
ton with 21. while Huckel's 17
and O'Neill's 16 spearheaded the
Wildcats. °

It was the worst beating the
‘Cats have taken since rubbing
elbows with national champion
Cincinnati four years ago. But
it is no disgrace to lose to a
team that has since beaten

North Carotina and almost de-
feated Louisville without Hum-
mer. “I don't know.” said Drie-
sell after the game. ‘‘if they are
that wood or we are that bad.”
Carolina will tell you.

WASHED BY WAVE

After that though, the Wild-
cat confidence was to prove ob
literated when they needed it.
Rolling to an early 26-17 lead
over Tulane’s Green Wave. the
‘Cats met their now-famous an-
esthetic—the press—and most of
21 turnovers later, there was
solemnity in the Davidson dress-
ing room after a 93-89 loss.

With seven minutes ‘to go in
the half. three straight traveling
violations helped Tulane to a
35-32 margin. and at the half
the Green Wave led by 53-50
against Driesell’s defense-mind-
ed Wildcats.

With Youngdale. who totaled
25. and Huckel providing a hot
hand. the Wildcats surged to a
62-54 lead to start the second
half but, as they did many
times, frittered away the lead,
culminated by Bob Spurck’s
jumper to make it 74-all with
7:29 to go. The rest of the game
was a see-saw ride, with two
foul shots each by sophomores
Terry Habig and Johnny Arth-
urs the killing blows. Once
again the Wildcats succumbed
to the pressures of a close game

DELTS FALL

‘and a noisy gym. although they
were playing against a team
well-acquainted with losing.

Too much pressure. too little
experience and a game of dom.
inoes proved the. Wildcats’ un
doing once they returned to the
-once friendly confines of the
Charlotte Coliseum. Lightly-re-
garded but. seniorstocked
George. Washington refused to
fall to the pressure of a con.
‘sistently changing lead and
dealt the ‘Cats their third
straight, blow. 59.54

HUCKEL HALTED

The Colonials employed unex
pected maneuvers both offen
sively and defensively, Coach
Babe , McCarthy. who has, been
known for years as a master
strategist. made use of the
Domino offense. which he dis-
covered several years ago at
Mississippi State. whereby the
smaller Colonials spread out
over the floor in an attempt to
isolate five one and-one set-ups.
Even more shocking was the
way the GW defense allowed
Huckel ontv one errant field
goal attempt and a total of a
measly two points before he
fouled out with 9:21 remaining.

The final blow was struck by
Dick Ellis. whose 18-footer with
22 seconds remaining sent the
Wildcats to defeat land again.
But the real hero for victory-
starved GW was 5-8 Joe Lalli,
who set up the offense compar-
able to football's single-wing and
ran rings around the ‘Cat de-
fenders to the tune of 16 points
and numerous assists.

After Ellis’ swisher the Wild
eats brought the ball up and
called time with :17 to play. But
the Colonials’ stiff defense pre-
vented the back-courters from
getting the ball into shooting
range. and Dave Moser had to
call another rest interval at :05.
A desperation turn-around shot
by Scott Sinnock at the buzzer
was hurried and wide and for
the second straight game, the
opposing coach_was hoisted on
his delirious team's shoulders.

The Colonials, whose 53.9 per
cent. topped the Wildcats’ 45,
were paced by senior Terry
Grefe’s 24 points. Rod Knowles
led the ‘Cats with a mere 15,
although he fouled out with 11:44

left. The Wildcats managed only-

18 of 28 foul shots for 64.3 per
cent. while GW managed 13 of
16—81.3 per cent—from the char-
ity strip.

LOST LEAD

Tournament time, and David-
son's first-round foe, Maryland,
was picked as the team to beat.
Once again the ‘Cats had it in
the bag with a 42-32 lead with
10:30 to go and a 52-41 margin
after Huckel’s jumper at 7:30.
But :Maryland had scouted the
Wildcats. and the press was on.
The ‘Cats managed just three
points in the next five-and-a-
half minutes, finding themselves
down 59-55 with two minutes to
play. Ahd although the Wildcats
only lost 86-65, they trailed 65-59
after 'a Julius Johnson free
throw with 22 second left.

The ‘Cdts scored six, but Joe
Harrington had sunk a free
throw with :08 left, and despite

the scoring efforts of Mike
Span. O'Neill and Youngdale. it
was another one point loss. The
‘Cats were held to 36 shots as
opposed to 50 by Maryland's
reputedly deliberate shooters.
Huckel again led alt. scorers
with 22, scoring on seven of
eight..from ‘the fleor and eight
of nine from the line. The ‘Cats
hit 636 per cent from outside
but commitied 21 turnovers.

Thines just had not jelled, and
so Driesell decided to remove
Youncdale and = Sinnock for
Spann and O'Neill in an effort
lo: reyamp the speed and shoot
ing. confidence of the team. So
O'Neilt hit 14 -in the first haif
against Fordham and 19 for -the
game and Spann contributed fine
defense and board work jin a
74-60 win. With a large size as
sist from Knowles. who unlim
bered for 25 points and 23 re
bounds although the ‘Cats had
trouble feeding him. Davidson
finally shot down another oppon
ent in some fashion of ‘finesse.

Although committing 16 turn
overs, the. press was not quite
as bothersome. The ‘Cats were
still bothered by one. of their
season bugaboos .- not blocking
out on the boards but they ex
hibited a better defense overall.
Just this time the ‘Cats’ meow
had ‘turned into a more sinister
sound.

‘CATS CLAW CAVS

And then there was Charlottes-
ville on a night when spectators
were few and far between. Huck-
el made sure that they. were not
to relish missing the Orange
Bow! to pull for the Cavaliers.
And for the first time this sea-
son. the Wildcats were up to the
challenge of a tight game with

‘a 75-71 victory.

Some of the success the ‘Cats
had with Vireinia can be attrib
uted to the Cavs’ poor shooting
(32 per cent), but a great deal
of credit has to go to their reso-
lution not to blow their slim
lead. Huckel’s 30 points, 20 com

cats. But back to old tricks. Ex-'
cept this time there were fewer,
turnovers and colder shooters. |
And a lot of the trouble came’
when Dave Moser and Huckel
fouled out with over four min |
utes to play. The ‘Cats had a
chance to win it when Bob Pick-
ens and Spann combined for a
steal with :22 to go and one
point down. But Youngdale’s
jumper missed and Knowles’ fol-
low was disallowed in favor of
a pushing foul. which Tom
Green made good on for a 72-69
final score.

Johnny Moates gunned for 35
points for the victorious Spiders.
while Knowles led the ‘Cats with
21. The Wildcats were success-
ful on only 40 per cent of their
shots.

It was simply a case of too
many turnovers, not enough
shots and board lapses that did
the ‘Cats in. All should improve
with age.

Sigs Continue Domination

The undefeated Kappa Sigs continued to rumble by their opposition in fine

fashion by

“Pistol Pete’ Ort popped in
16 while Tucker Laxton scored
12. Joe Jelks contributed eight.
For the vanquished E's, K. D.
Weeks and Pits Armfield tallied
10 and eight points, respective-
ly.

Again Ort was the high scorer
and rebounder with 16 points in
just three quarters of play
against the Pikas. All the Sigs
scored in the rout. The Pikas
were led by Tommy “Rube”
Poston and John “Bubba Kill”
Croom with 12 and 11 points.

The E‘s rebounded magnifi-
cently from their earlier defeat
to beat the Independents. Gresh
Bayne and Weeks helped the E's
keep their cool with 12 points
apiece. Bruce Weidner had 12
for the Indies.

The ATO’s bombed the Phi
Gams, 60-38. Super-Cecil Clifton
stuffed in 16 points while Dave
Jennings had 11. Bill Clark had
nine along with Geoff Birkhead.

Then. returning to the home

‘Cats go against VPI's tough
team. The Gobblers opened ev
eryone’s eyes with their season

lotte. Since that game, Tech has
extended its record to 6-2 with
wins over Purdue, Eastern Ken-
