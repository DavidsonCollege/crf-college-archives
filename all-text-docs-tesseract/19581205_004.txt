THE DAVIDSONIAN

Johnston Reviews
Book By Byrnes

On November 18 at Ivey’s in
Charlotte, Dr. Frontis Johnston
reviewed the new book, “All in
One Lifetime,” by ex-Governor
James F, Byrnes of South Caro-
lina.

A crowd of several hundred
people including Governor and
Mrs. Byrnes attended the re-
view. Dr. Johnston spoke for
about 45 minutes and then Gov-
ernor Byrnes commented for
about 10 minutes on what Dr.
Johnston had said.

Dr. Johnston spoke mainly on
what the book covered and what
he wished it had covered. The
book ‘spans the entire period of
Byrnes’ life and it is intended
to be an autobiography rather
than history. The inain part of
the book, however. covers the
period from 1942-1947 during
which Byrnes served as War
Mobilization Director and Sec-
tetary of State.

The book. although not high-
ly controversial, does conflict
with the memoirs of Truman on
the policy of dealing with the
Communists, especially at the
Moscow Conference. Dr. Johns-
ton brought out that even when
Byrnes presents his side of the

The professor who prefer-

work. It is difficult to see
how absence from class facili-
tates this. If courses are poor-
ly taught or pitched at too
low a level, the remedy lies
in administrative action and
not in weakening class atten-
dance.”

At the present time Berlin is in the headlines of the

due to its division into two parts.

Balentine Hoping | Elections

For Large Turnout

An organizational meeting to
pursue the ideas presénted by
Doug Balentine in ao DAVID-
SONIAN article two weeks ago
will be held Monday night at
10 o'clock in the College Union.
At that time interested students
will establish a continuing pro-
gram of debates and discussions
on religious matters as related
to many various topics.

The mecting was originally
scheduled for this past Monday,
but only eight persons were
present. “Many others are in-
terested, I’m sure,” stated Bal-
,entine after the small turnout.
“Poor planning accounts for it
‘and we hope to remedy that.”
| Balentine set forth his gen-
jeral idea in this paper's Letter
to the Editor column. With no
other publicity, questionnaires
were distributed after chapel on
Tuesday before the holidays. Al-
‘though many did not know their
significance. seventy showed an
|interest in the proposed pro-
‘gram and thirty-four indicated
they would attend the meeting.

“We definitely hope to ac-
complish more on Monday
night, with the advantage of

‘more publicity,” Balentine said.

“I feel this program, when or-
ganized by active participants.
can develop into a large, worth-
while endeavor.”

This is done primarily by alum-
ni, but also from other friends
such as parents of students and
other interested parties. Also,
a part of this sum comes from’
corporations such as Proctor}
and Gamble. and Union Carbide.
Question: Are all grants
based on need of the student?
Answer: Most of the major
scholarships awarded by David-
son College do have need as a
basic criterion. This also applies
to the grants-in-aid. By tradi-
tion, sons of Southern Presbyte-
rian ministers are entitled to
one-half tuition. Athletic grants
and foreign § student scholar-
ships are not awarded on a ba-
sis of need. 7
Question: Isn't there some
Inconsistency in the fect that
acedemic scholarships are

grants ere not?
Answer: Well, this is a result

of the recognition by the Trus-|!

money than we do for athletic
endeavors, and that in order to
continue competing with these
teams we must follow this
