A Movie for Easter:

By MERIDETH DURDEN
Senior Features Editor
A visual impression of

Rithard Gill corresponds to his |

life a decade ago. The bespecta-
cled Gill was ‘a respected
Economics professor at Har-
vard, his alma mater. But when
Gill starts to talk in his sonor-
ous bass voice, he resounds

with his current career. He isan —

internationally acclaimed opera
singer. Last week he finished
starring in “The Flying Dutch-
man” in Charlotte: This week
he is a visiting economist at
Davidson. But he didn’t always
lead this double life.

A decade ago he and his
family were firmly established
in Cambridge. His Principles of
Economics course was the larg-
est course offered. His short
stories were published in the

New Yorker. In addition, he ~

was house master of the largest
house at Harvard. In short, he
was a success. f

Gill began taking voice les-
sons. As a boy ‘he sang duets
with his music teacher mother
and he had sung .some in
college. But he really had not
used his bass voice for 15
years.

Gill began taking music les-

sons “mainly due to a feeling of -

‘dissatisfaction that I had let my
voice, which was fairly nice in
college, deteriorate so complete-
ly. Really, I was unable. to

life ‘and it was a deeper thing
than I had thought.”

“I was a typical academic. I
had a bad back and after a
lecture I sort of had to ease
myself down into a chair.”” Now
his physical activity centers
around an “‘incompetent but
vigorous’’ sports life.

Gill's life has changed com-
pletely. He went from the
secure tenured life at Harvard
to the volatile opera world.
Betty, his wife, turned down a
job as principal of a Boston
school to accompany her hus-
band. She is a musician also and

Gill contends that when he
and his wife first changed
lifestyles ‘‘We were protected
by layers and layers of inno-
cence.” But “Now that we've
made the switch, I can’t ima-
gitte not having made it.”

_“I feel set I’m fortunate in

being able to do it. I’ve since
discovered that there are a
great many people who have
somewhat similar desires but
forcibly narrow their vistas"
because of the demands of their
professional life. .

“I feel very lucky. Who
would have thought, starting
voice training so late, that there
was any possibility of a sub-

stantial professional career. It's.

unheard of in singing because it
is so athletic and if you don’t do
the athletics...at an early stage,
forget it.

“My voice is actually physic-
ally improving now. There’s no
question about it—in size, color
and so forth. So TI really will
have a career as long as T'went
to sing.

“My guess is that if the body
lasts, the voice will last.”

In retrospect, Gill is glad he
made. the jump. “If I had to
