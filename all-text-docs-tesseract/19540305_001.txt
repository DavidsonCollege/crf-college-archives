College Artist Series
Brings Hubert Alyea

Dr. Hubert N. Alyea, distin-
guished and popular Princeton
University scientist, has for sev-
eral years been making the
mysteries of atomic energy intelli-
gible—and interesting—to lay-
men all over the United States.

On March 10 he will come to
Davidson to give his lecture-
demonstration in Chambers Audi-
torium at 8:15 p.m. He has given
this lecture, featured last year in
Life magazine, to seven hundred
audiences totaling six hundred
thousand persons.

The lecture, entitled “Atomic
Energy, Weapon for Peace,” will
be demonstrated by many chemical
experiments which require such
assorted properties as a pail half
filled with sand (‘“coarse, dirty
sand is OK,” says the Professor),
a small dry-ice fire extinguisher,
flood lights and two motion pic-
ture projectors.

Among other features of the
lecture will be the tracing of the
growth of ideas which led to the

Professor Alyea graduated from
Princeton University in 1925. Fol-

: lowing this, he spent a year at the

Nobel Institute, Stockholm, Swe-
den, and returned to get his doc-
tor’s degree from Princeton in
10929. The next year was spent at
the University of Minnesota study-
ing the chemical effects of radium,
and the next year at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute in Berlin inves-
tigating the explosion of gases.
Since then he has been a mem-
ber of the Chemistry Department
of Princeton University.

lecture upon presentation of their
identification cards.

The entire production is under
the direction of Bob Mims,. presi-
dent of the organization, and Prof.
Raymond W. Tyson is acting as
faculty advisor for the play. The
set is being designed and executed
by Swain Loy; lighting and back-
stage work will be handled by
Jack Pietenpol.

Dick Dabney, newcomer to our
stage and to our campus, will be
seen in the leading role of Lach-
len, the friendless, frustrated Scot
about whom the conflict of the
drama revolves. The role of Mar-
garet, the army nurse, will be
played by Martha (Mrs. Sam)
Magill, who made her Davidson
stage debut last December in “A
Chronicle of Joe.” Ed Hadley will
take the part of Yank. Harold Hall
will be seen as Digger, Allie Cone
as Kiwi, Charlie Oliver as Blossom,
Fred Stimmers as Tommy, and
Buddy Liles as a Colonel. An
orderly will be played by Sandy
McGeachy.

“The Hasty Heart” is perhaps
the most successful play ever to
come from the pen of John
Patrick. It enjoyed a long run on
Broadway in 1045, and has since
fast become a “standard” for little
theater and college groups. The
warm sincerity of the theme, to-
gether with Patrick’s careful and
intelligent treatment of it, has
been widely praised by critics both

WHITE ANNOUNCES
SENIOR INTERVIEWS

The placement bureau for the
seniors continues its work with
many firms having already visited
the campus, including the follow-
ing: Burlington Mills, the Han-
over Bank of New York, Cargill’s,
Inc., Proctor and Gamble, House-
hold Finance Company, Traveller’s
Insurance Agency, Oak Ridge Re-
search Laboratory, Aberdeen
Proving Grounds, Union Carbide
and Carbon Corporation, Deering
Service Corporation, and Rich’s of
Atlanta.

This week The Connecticut Mu-
tual Insurance Company was at the
college.

In following weeks the Nation-
al Security Agency, General Elec-
trie Company, Riegel Textile,
Sears-Roebuck and Company, Col-
gate-Palmolive Company, South-
ern Dairies and the Providence Mu-
tual Insurance Company are ex-
pected to visit the school.

Elgin White, publicity director
of the college, said it is always
advisable for the seniors, if they
are not pre-med or pre-ministerial
students, to sign up for interviews
with these companies. Davidson
is one of the few schools in this
area which has these companies
send representatives to its campus.
These companies in the past have
always had high regard for David.
son men, and the school has placed
many seniors with outstanding
companies, and all are doing ex-
ceptionally well.

A good many seniors who feel
that they are going into the armed
services hesitate about signing up.
Mr. White said that they shouldn't,
for all these representatives have
emphasized the fact that they want
to talk to these men and get a
line on them for when they finish
their duty with the government.
Many of these men can move right
into these companies after their
army duties if the company is in-
terested in them.

Also several firms, wanting more
experienced men than the seniors,
have asked for men who have al-
ready put in their army duty.

Mr. White said that more firms
other than the ones listed are ex-
pected to come from now until
the first part of May.

REV. THOS. H. McDILL
IS SUNDAY EVENING
VESPERS SPEAKER

The vespers speaker this Sunday
evening will be the Reverend
Thomas H. MeDill, Jr., B.D., Pro-
fessor of Pastoral Theology and
Pastoral Counciling at Columbia

Erskine College in 1938 and his
Th. B. from Erskine Theological
Seminary in 1940. He did special
work in Psychiatry at the Univer-
sity of California in 1944, and was
a student at Princeton Seminary

earned his B.D. at Columbia Semi-
nary in 1947. He subsequently
completed a portion of the re-
quirement for his Th. M.

Mr. McDill was licensed and or-
dained by the First Presbytery of
the ARP. Church in Charlotte,

LINGLE CHAPEL OPEN
FOR DEVOTIONS

Due to « desire expressed by
many students that a quiet
place should be set aside on
the campus for dally devo-
tions, Lingle Chapel will be

beginning Monday for all stu-
dents interested. Bibles will be
provided and a suggested de-
votional guide will be placed
in the front of the chapel.

This plan is on es temporary
basis and will become perma-

‘Move Effective With End
\Of Present College Term

Mr. John C. Bailey, Jr., has resigned as Dean of Students. His resignation becomes

1954 Summer Session
Initiates New Policies

The 1954 summer session at Davidson College, for the
first time a single term session, will open on June 3, for
laboratory science courses and on June 9, 1954, for other
courses. The session will end on July 21, and the Davidson
campus will spend a lone, studentless month watching the
progress on gigantic Belk Dormitory now being erected.

"Y’ Sponsors Dance
Featuring Morrow

YMCA social chairman Bill Ship-
ley announces that arrangements
have been made for transportation
of dates from Charlotte to tomor-
row night’s informal dance in the
Union Baliroom.

Several cars have been acquired
in order to assist students need-
ing a ride for their dates.

The dance, co-sponsored by the
YMCA and the College Union, is
to be given in conjunction with
the Red and Black intra-squad
football game Saturday afternoon.
Students are invited to bring dates
to the game and to the dance fol-
lowing that evening.

Jessie Morrow and his trio will
return to the bandstand and
promise another evening of
rhythm and entertainment. At a
similar dance several weeks ago,
Jessie’s group made quite a hit
with the Davidson crowd.

Shipley said that these dances
are planned to replace former ex-
change days with nearby women’s
colleges.

.The dance will begin at 8
o'clock. Admission is free and re-
freshments will be served.

Several outstanding changes in
policy mark this year’s summer
session. Of first interest to the
monkish students will be the new
policy of admitting girls as dormi-
tory resident students for the ses-
sion. There is little doubt attached
to the statement that the faculty
move to admit female students to
the summer term is the most gen-
erally accepted ruling since the
abolition of the aggregate cut limit
last fall.

The one term = system will
necessitate both a larger influx
of students, turning the summer
campus from a lonely desert to a
scene not unlike the average win-
ter one, and a larger variety of
courses available to students at-
tending the term.

Some thirty-three courses have
been offered for the term, though
enrollment qualifying class time
to teach any one course will be
necessary before that course will
reach the final agenda.

Most departments will be repre-
sented this summer by two pro-
fessors instead of the customary
one for each term. A wide variety
of Psychology, History, English,
Economics and Scierice courses is
offered. Sociology 21-22, a course
not offered at Davidson for sev-
eral years, will be offered during
the summer with Dr. G. L. Aber-
nethy as professor.

Ostwalt Conducts Reading
To Increase Student Reading Rate

By JOHN HEIRS

An experiment to increase the
reading speeds of students is cur-
rently being conducted by Dr. Jay
H. Ostwalt. The idea is not only to
speed up the slow readers, but
to make substantial increases in
the reading rates of those who al-
ready have high speeds.

At this time there are five
classes meeting at various times
on Monday and on Wednesday
through Friday in the special
room on the second floor of the
Chambers Building which the col-
lege has set aside for this work.
This is known as the Remedial
Reading Clinic. -

There is an average of six stu-
dents per class. The classes, which
have been running since February
Oth and will conclude just before
spring holidays, are directed by
student assistants John Fite and

Ronnie Wilson.

The program is given without
charge during this experimental
stage, but it is probable that a
small fee will be charged in the
future.

If the results of the first course
warrant future classes, they will
be given throughout the year with
a new course starting every six
weeks,

The college has purchased new
equipment valued at around
$1,000 to use in the project. The
tachistoscope, a slide projector
which flashes digits and phrases
on a screen at rates up to a hun-
dredth of a second, constitutes
the largest expenditure for this
work. There are also a new screen
and several hundred slides to use
with the tachistoscope.

Two rate-reading machines used
in the program are also new. When

using one of these machines, the
material to be read is placed on
the machine. As the student reads,
a metal bar moves down the page
at the rate of speed which has
been selected on the control scale.
This constantly moving bar forces
the reader to concentrate con-
tinuously on the material he is
reading and prevents spasmodic
reading. It presses the student to
read at his utmost speed.

The recently acquired eye
tester is used to give each student
an eye test before he begins the
reading program. The machine is
capable of determining obvious
visual defects which might hinder
a person's reading.

After successfully completing
the eye test, the student takes a
reading test to determine his rate
of reading and his comprehension
of what he reads. Another such

Spring Blood Drive
Jointly Sponsored

ODK president Bill Hood an-
nounced this week that the spring
Red Cross Blood Drive on the
Davidson campus will be under the
joint sponsorship of ODK and
Scabbard and Blade.

Charlie Hasty has been selected
by Scabbard and Blade to head
the drive for that organization,
according to Scabbard and Blade
president Buddy Lamon.

‘ Hood said that Fred Stowe will
probably be in charge of the ODK
effort in the drive.

Both ODK and Scabbard and
Blade have sponsored successful
blood donation drives in the past
for the Red Cross, but this is the
first time they have staged a joint
sponsorship.

Date for the drive will be an-
nounced by the organizations at a
later time.

Smith Announces The
Week's Union Events

Mr. Shaw Smith of the College
Union announces the following
events at the Union during the
next week:

Saturday, March 6—State Vocal
Contest, part of which is to be
held in the Union from 9:00 a.m.
to 3:00 p.m. An informal Y-Union
Dance for faculty and students is
to be held beginning at 8:00 p.m.

Tuesday, March 9 — Prof. and
Mrs. Moore will give a recital in
the College Union Ballroom begin-
ning at 8:15. Everybody is invited
and the admission is free.

Wednesday, March 10—After
Mr. Alyea’s performance for the
Artist Series, there will be a re-
ception for everyone in the Union
Ballroom.

Thursday, March 11—The Coker
College Glee Club will present a
concert beginning at 8:15 in the
Ballroom.

Friday, March 12—Columbia Bi-
centennial Exhibition begins. At
8:15 p.m., Dr. J. S. Wilson of the
Davidson faculty will hold an in-
formal discussion of the Modern
Novel in the Union Ballroom. Both

Disney technicolor movie, “Icha-
bod and Mr. Toad,” will be shown
at 3:30 in the afternoon and again
at 9:00 that evening. Admission is

Classes

test is given when the student has
finished the course. A statistical
analysis will then be administered
to the results of the two tests to
determine whether the increase is
a significant one.

The classes last thirty minutes
with the first half being devoted
to eye exercises. Using the tachis-
toscope, the instructor flashes
digits and phrases on the screen
at speeds up to a hundredth of a
second. Scientists say that most
people tend to us only the central
part of the retina, the part of the
eye with which we see. These ex-
ercises are used to make the stu-
dent use the outer part of the

retina, the periphery, also.

The last half of the class con-
sists of readings timed with a
stop watch. A comprehension test

given on the reading.

He also stated that Dean Bailey
has felt for some time that the
duties of his office were too heavy,
and while he is in good health, he
feels it wiser for him to resign and
undertake a full-time teaching
schedule again.

Dr. Cunningham said that Dean
Bailey has enjoyed the friendship
of the students during his entire
tenure of office, together with the
respect and confidence of the
faculty in dealing with student
problems.

Dean Bailey graduated from Da-
vidson in 1922 after which he im-
mediately became’ principal and
Latin teacher at Davidson High
School. In 1925 he joined the
faculty of Davidson College as As-
sistant Professor of Greek.

From 1928 to 1932 he taught
Greek at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, where he received his A.M.
degree.

In 1932 Dean Bailey returned to
Davidson as Professor of Greck.
He was appointed Dean of Stu-
dents in 1941, having now served
in that capacity for 13 years.

While a student at Davidson
College Dean Bailey was outstand-
ing in academic and extra-curricu-
lar activities. He was a member
of Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Beta
Kappa, and Kappa Alpha social fra-
ternity.

A native of Summerton, S. C.,
he is the son of a Presbyterian
minister. ,

with the entire class’ 1.251
average.

Literary Societies
Initiate Members,
Crilicize Papers

The Philanthropic, and Euma-
nean Literary Societies held their
regular biweekly meetings Mon-
day night. Both of the meetings
were cut short because of reviews.

With President Bob Dunbar pre-
siding, the Phis held a short busi-
ness meeting. Following this was
the highlight of the evening, the
initiation of four new freshmen
into the society. The new mem-
bers are Reece Middleton, Boyce
Martin, Bunny Perkinson, and
Steve Huntley. The meeting con-
cluded with the supervisors’ re-
ports by Joe Garrison and John
Trotti.

Across the way in Eu Hall the
members of Eumanean Literary
Society enjoyed three freshman
papers and a debate by four forensic
members. The meeting opened
with the devotional, which was
led by Henry Brockmann, acting
president.

After the business of the eve-
ning was finished, three new
freshman members, Tony Dick,
Tom Morgan, and Jim Batten, read
their papers. Dick spoke on “Com-
ing of Age in Davidson.” Morgan
read a short dissertation entitled
“A Radical Idea.” Batten presented
a satire, “Home Again.”

Following this was a well-repre-
sented extemporaneous debate on
the Supreme Court test concern-
ing the policy of segregation.
