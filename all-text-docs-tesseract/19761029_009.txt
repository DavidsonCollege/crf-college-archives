DAVIDSON’S FOOTBALL team shows its style during

games earlier this season before taking their first victory
last Saturday over Hampden-Sydney.

Cats sneak past Hampden-Sydney

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Davidson’s unusually pot-
ent offense clawed back from
an early 14-point deficit last
Saturday against Hampden
Sydney, to claim their first
victory of.the season, 20-14.

Page Walley led the Wildcat
comeback with three touch-
down plunges from one yard
out. Walley finished the day
with a total of 115 yards in 26
carries as he had the best
game for a Wildcat runner this
year.

Late in the second quarter,
the Wildcats found themselves
in an all too familiar position
as they trailed by two touch-
downs. But a double reverse
pitch back to quarterback Bob
McCarthy caught the Tigers
off balance and moved the ball
to the Hampden-Sydney six
yard line with less than a
minute in the half.

The next three plays netted
five yards for the Cats and on
a crucial fourth down play
Davidson scored with 14 sec-
onds left in the half. Coach Ed
Farrell credited determination
for the crucial first half touch-
down.

“We did something that I
haven’t seen around here in
three years. We blew two sure
passes for touchdowns and
then came to a crucial fourth
down situation.

‘‘In the past, I think we
would have thrown up the
surrender flag mentally but
this time the guys refused to
give into adversity. The off-
ensive line really blew out of
there on fourth down and
Page was able to get the
touchdown.”

In the second half, David-
son’s defense took over and
shut off the Tiger’s offense
completely .: The Wildcat. off-
ense was able to capitalize on
the resulting. good field posi-
tion ahd’ score the necessary
points) i '

; “Our defense is more exper-
iénced this year and our
offense is not turning the ball
over as they had in the past.

As a result, our team doesn’t .

have to play consistently good
defense in our own territory,”
Farrell explained.

Farrell cited the Madison
contest as giving confidence to
his revitalized offense. David-
son’s offense exploded for 346
yards total offense with 276 of
those yards coming on the
ground.

‘‘We got some confidence
from that game when we
scored two touchdowns, when
we had to, against a very
tough defensive team,” said
Farrell.

Although pleased with his
offense’s improvement, Farrell
feels that the Wildcats still
need greater consistency in

the absence of a quick scoring
punch.

“We don’t have a long ball
threat in the form of a break-
away runner and we don’t
have receivers with blazing

speed. Since we don’t score.

with big plays we need a
consistent offense that can
grind out yardage and we were
able to do that against Hamp-
den-Sydney.”

Davidson’s first victory
should provide extra confid-
ence for the Wildcats when
they play Guilford this Satur-
day. It was only Coach Far-
rell’s fourth win as Davidson
coach but it was his most
pleasing.
