New Constitution To Be
Discussed and Voted On

Committee Completes First
Revision of Constitution
Since 1912

MAKE NO BIG CHANGES

Dr. Currie Advises On Legal
Technicalities

The revised Constitution of
the Student Government of
Davidson College was present-
ed and explained to the student
body by Wilbur Edwards,
president, in a meeting follow-
ing the chapel period on last
Friday morning, Feb. 19.

This revision was made in an ef-
fort to clarify the existing consti-
tution, bring it up to date by incor-
porating the amendments which
have been added to it, and arrange
the material in a more logical and
convenient order; and it is the work
of a committee cmder Edwards,
which included John Winn, Tom
Thurston, Bill Kiesewetter, Watson
Street, Bill Marquess, Dave New-
bold, and Julian Squires.

Realizing the need for this revi-
sion, Edwards worked out a new
draft and referred it to Dr. Archi-
bald Currie, professor of Political
Science, for advice on certain legal
technicalities. It was then studied
and corrected by the student com-
mittee,

No Major Changes

The new constitution, which in-
volves no major changes in the
form of student government here
at Davidson, was distributed among
the students in mimeographed cir-
cular form for closer examination
prior to the discussion and voting
on next Monday, March 1.

However, since the distribution of
these mimeographed copies, several
typographical errors and omissions
have been discovered. The correc-
tions of these mistakes are to be
found elsewhere in this issue of The
Davidsonian.

The constitution in its
form was adopted in 1912, and since
ime no been

that time no revision” has
made. A number of errors have
crept in with the annual re-printing,
and the organization of the material
in the document is such that refer-
ence to it is uncertain.

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women-— lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they
personally prefer a light smoke.

Mr. Cooper verifies the wisdom of this prefer-
ence, and so do other leading artists of the radio,
stage, screen and opera. Their voices are their
fortunes. That’s why so many of them smoke
Luckies. You, too, can have the throat protection
