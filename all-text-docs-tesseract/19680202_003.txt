Extended Rushing Program

Planned To Aid Freshmen
Who Do Not Receive Bids

Extended rush, a new pro-
gram developed last year by
the Interfraternity Council to
bring about certain reforms
in the fraternity system, will
go into effect this semester
for the first time.

The new program is de-
signed to assist rushees who
do not receive bids at the
end of this week's formal
rush. It gives such students
a _ chance to participate in
some aspects of fraternity
life, similar to a social affil-
iate.

Tuesday evening after the
final rush party all rushees
went to the Morrison Room
in the College Union and
filled out cards listing the
six fraternities whose parties
they attended in order of
preference,

In the event that a rushee
does not receive a bid, his
preference’ will be read off
the card and matched as
closely as possible with the

Ways To Amend Faults
Vary In Other Colleges

Other colleges and universi-
ties have dealt with the fra-
ternity situation in varying
ways, and in some cases the
fraternities themselves have
developed unique programs.

In trying to answer the
criticism of anti-intellectual-
ism, fraternities at the Uni-
versity of Utah introduced a
“Greek College Bowl" in
which fraternities compete on
questions in the humanities
and social sciences before the
entire student body.

The Utah system adds to
rush week an_ intellectual
tone which counter-balances
the normal exclusively social
atmosphere.

their own point of view.

Other fraternities have act-
ed to overcome the charge
that they narrow a member's
range of acquaintances. At
Drake University, exchange
dinners are sponsored be-
tween the houses, and the
University of Arizona frater-
nities have a foreign student
program similar to the Rich-
ardson Scholar program at
Davidson, in which the schol.
ars eat at various houses
during their year at David-
son.

In order to get communica-
tion with faculty members,
the Interfraternity Council at
the University of Cincinnati
initiated a student - faculty
softball league.

Most of the accent has been
on producing a more integrat-
ed student life, with an end
to the split between the aca-
demic and social life.

Instead of providing only
an escape from the rigors of

a

fraternities. However, they
will be excluded from activi-
ties limited to the brother-
hood, such as fraternity rites
and voting.

Extended rushees may re-
ceive bids at any point in
the extended rush period. At
the end of two months, how-
ever, if the rushee has :still
not received a bid, he chang-
es fraternities if he wants to
or if the fraternity no longer
wishes him to participate in
their program.

On the other hand, if both
the extended rushee and the
fraternity are agreeable, he
may stay with the same fra-
ternity.

Rushees who receive bids
at the end of this week's
formal rush period but do
not accept them may work
eut a social affiliation plan
with an agreeable fraternity.
However, they will be barred
from participating in the
IFC’s extended rush plan.

Fraternities Get Praise, Barbs

Like politics and women,
fraternities at Davidson have
been both praised and de.
rided.

With nearly 70 per cent of
the students in fraternities,
the system has become. the
center for social activity on
campus. Not only do frater
nities sponsor parties and
banquets, but they also pro
vide members with opportun

ities to form close friend
ships with their brothers.
Proponents of the fraterni-
ty system call the fellowship
generated in the houses their
best asset. The fraternity
gives each member the
chance to identify with a rel-
atively small group of close
friends and know them well.
Supporters also argue that
fraternities offer members a

chance to mature and accept
responsibility within the fra-
ternity officers or hold other
positions of leadership with
in the house.

But others do not see the
system as a beneficial insti-
tution. Criticism has come
from all elements of the col
lege community. including
both fraternity members and
indépendents, faculty and

Fraternities Have Rarely Enjoyed
Tranquil Existence At Davidson

Rarely have fraternities
had a peaceful existence at
Davidson, for since the found-
ing of Chi Phi and Kappa
Alpha in 1859, fraternities
have been the center of a
debate that once reached riot
proportions.

After barely surviving the
Civi War and Reconstruction..
fraternities were faced with
a relocation problem when
Chambers burned in 1921.

As a temporary measure,
Philanthropic and Eumanean
Halls were used for meet-
ings, and boarding houses.
not sponsored by the college,
were maintained in town.

The problem of relocation
was solved in 1928 when

academic pressures, frater-
nities have been forced to
move toward providing a
freer atmosphere for intel-
lectual inquiry than a struc-
tured college curiculum can
provide.

The element of force has
come through the challenge
of the idea of a living-learri-
ing dormitory. This concept
calls for classes, social. life.
recreation, eating and most
other activities to be concen.
trated in the student's dormi-
tory.

Usually, the living-learning
plan has called for faculty
members and students living
in the same building.

The idea has been behind
some of the criticism of dor-
mitories at Davidson, which
have been noted for their
compartmentalization of life,
with studying taking place in
Chambers and the library,
sleeping in the dormitories,
and social life and eating in
the Union. or in fraternity
houses. .

RUSH PARTY

Jackson. Court was complet
ed. This cluster of ‘small
houses, now. shared by the
mathematics department and
married students, served for
30 years. until the comple
tion of Patterson Fraternity
Court. in 1958.

Opposition to fraternities
has been voiced on several.
occasions. As early as 1894 a
petition was circulated call
ing for the abolition of the
fraternities, but no action
ever resulted.

However, real opposition
crystalized in 1960 and has
never yet settled. In that
year the faculty voted deci
sively to forbid freshman
pledging and rush after a
number of fraternity mem
bers went inactive and peti.
tioned the facuky to institute
sophomore rush as a solution
to current fraternity short
comings.

Among the cited shoricom
ings were the first-week rush
of freshmen and the monop
oly on campus social. life
held by fraternities.

The vote of the faculty.
which came on May 3, was
promptly reversed by the
trustees on the grounds that
there was no. established
trend toward sophomore
rushing, that fraternities
were apparently fulfilling
student social needs, and
that the fraternity chapters
at Davidson opposed any
change.

By this time Lingle Manor
had been begun as an alter-
native to fraternities, and of-
fered membership to any stu-
dent who would pay the se
mester fee of $10.

However, the group went
too far, acturding to past
President Sam Johnson, and
allowed too much freedom of
the individual by its lack of
means to compel any group
action.

As a result, the group soen
fell apart and membership
dropped from more than 50

Critics charge that the sys-
tem excludes nearly 30 per
cent of the student body by
the blackballing system. by
which one or two brothers
can prevent a rushee from
being invited to pledge. They
claim: that the balling sys
tem tends to create narrow
social groups which isolate
members from the rest of
the college community.

Critics also believe frater
nities to be anti intellectual.
. Fraternities. they charge. de
ride scholarship, labelling
eager students as ‘flies’ or
“flits."

But some answer that the
fraternities need not be pri
marily. an. intelectual insti-
tution any more than the fac
ulty should sponsor beer

busts. Fraternities, by their_

nature, are more a intellec.
tual more than anti intellec:
dual.

However, fraternity sup
porters point to such ‘pro
grams as the ‘‘Blow Up" lec

sored a series of discussions
by poet Stephen Spender.

not all fraternity members
favor its use. Some feel that
chapters should extena the
rule so that several mem.
bers would have to object.to
a rushee before he would be

Iso. supporters see the se-

way to promote the harmon

by a fraternity. Any compro
mise woulyd weaken this fel-
lowship.

Opponents, though. say that
most freshman halls could
easily be transformed into
fraternities, and point to the
homogeneity of the student
body as the reason. ,

Blue Sky Recommendation

Asks For 7 Eating Clubs

Major changes in the Davidson fraternity system
were recommended last December by the Blue Sky
Committee's Sub-committee on Student Life.

Under the proposal, seven of the houses would be
used to feed 90 to 100 students each, with a standard-
ized cost of board. Freshmen would be assigned to
vacancies by lot.

Those who did not eat at one of the houses would
eat in the College Union, provided another union were
built, and facilities of each house would be open to
anyone for lounging, meetings, or parties.

The remaining five fraternity houses would be
used for administrative and educational purposes.

The committee proposed that one of the five hous-
es could be used for listening rooms, a record library,
and an art studio, another for placement facilities, an-
other as a guest house annex, the fourth as a foreign
language house, and the last for audio-visual purposes.

According to the committee's report, deficiences
of the present system include the compartmentaliza-
tion of student activities and of people into groups and
the “inadequate facilities for worthwhile use of lei-
sure.”

Bobby Lane, chairman of the sub-committee,
stressed that the committee was not “another frater-
nity evaluation committee,” but that its value lay in
the fact that it presented an alternative and showed
what could be done with the present facilities. _

Refering to the proposals for the use of Patterson
Court, Lane said that the principles were good but that
he was not optimistic as to their success.

Lane also stated, however, that he did not believe
that the proposals were “out of reach.”

Gus Cochran, president of the Interfraternity
Council, was generally favorably impressed with the
report but felt that it was not truly representative
of the students as a whole. ‘

Although he felt that the report needed to be
acted on, he said that more student reaction from both

upper and lower classmen was needed.

Cochran agreed that fraternities tend to compart-
mentalize people into groups, but felt this was good in
that it broke the number of people down into “livable
groups.”

He disagreed with the number of eating clubs and
stated that more houses would be needed because
“everyone should have a house he could call his
own,”

Whether there were fraternities or eating clubs
was not important to Cochran, as long as the eating
clubs were not formed around interest clubs.

He suggested that one advantage of fraternities
was that they tended to be broad in their selection,
while interest clubs would concentrate certain types of
people into certain fraternities.

Cochran felt that the aim of the report was good,
but proposed as a better solution a dual social system
of eating clubs and faternities. He believed that this
would strongly combine the best of both fraternities
and of the eating clubs.

Mike Mooty, president of Beta Theta Pi fraternity,
felt that the “three deficiences which this report iden-
tifies are not new to the Davidson campus.”

Mooty also stated that the fraternities could not
be held solely responsible for the lack of adequate’
facilities for non-fraternity men.

He said that “the recommendations regarding the
use of Patterson Court are very imaginative and some
of the uses are very needed.”

But he added that he hopes that “‘the resolution to
problems that the Blue Sky Committee has dekeniated
and other problems in the social structure of the col-
lege can be resolved within the system itself.”

Mooty felt that “great strides have already been
made in this direction,” and made no prediction as to
what the social structure of the college would be like
several years from now.
