FLAG fashion show raises $2100 for AIDS education

Davidson students, including David Kim pictured above,

AIDS awareness by participating in the FLAG fashion show.

By Beth Lindsey

Saturday night, FLAG
(Friends of Lesbians and Gays)
sponsored a fashion show in the
900 Room as part of an effort to
promote AIDS awareness on cam-
pus. Over 90:‘models participated
— students, faculty, alumni, and
staff represented all facets of cam-
pus life.

Many people spent much time
and energy throughout the past few
months to promote and plan for the
event. FLAG Co-Chair Hal
Dougherty came up with the idea
during the summer, and many
people were crucial to the event,
including Molly Johnson and Jan
Beasley fromthe Union and FLAG
Co-Chair Cat Grimmel. Johnson
says, “It was really Hal’s idea, but
it sounded great, and I offered to
help and here I am! It has taken a
lot of coordination simply because
we’ve done more than just had a
faapion show — there were spon-
sorships and also prizes for the
models. It was difficult enough to

try to communicate with so many

models all over campus.”
Beasley, also a Union intern,
says, “About 10 years ago, I worked
as a coordinator for fashion shows
for Ivey’s, adepartmentstore. This
is certainly quite a different expe-

for four years in ignorance of dis-
ease, sickness, and death.” She
points out that the Quilt is not only
about gay men, but also includes
women and children.

The panels are a variety of
colors, made from anything and
everything. Some are heartbreak-
ing, while some are funny. Some
are angry, and some are hopeful.
Some are ornate, while some are
very simple. They have been cre-
‘ated by friends and family mem-
bers, and each one captures the
essence of the person named on the
panel in a special way.

Some panels contain poems,
some have letters. ““You held me
up so many times. Now I will hold
you up to heaven forever,” says
one. Another asks, “Will you know
our names when we see you in
heaven?” —

“Tt’s amazing how much you
come to know about each person,”
says one student.

“The ones that were the most
personal were the most touching,”
says freshman Jennifer Hawkins.

Kristen Richardson says that
she would cry when she could re-
late to a panel. “I think that you
don’t know in what way you will
be affected — or to what degree. It
turns out to be the most simple
thing.”

Friends showed each other
their favorite panels and discussed,
in whispers, the tragedy of the baby
who was born with AIDS or the
man whonever gotto say goodbye.
Visitors recognized the names of
those they knew.

Each visitor was given the

opportunity to sign a special

Davidson panel. People expressed
their grief and understanding by
leaving their names; the panel will
now travel with the Quilt.

As visitors viewed the Quilt,
volunteers took a break outside.
One volunteer didn’t want to re-
turn: “Everywhere you look, there
are names of people who have died.
It’s so morbid.”

“T don’t think it’s morbid at
all,” says another volunteer. “There
are so many personal elements on
each panel, as opposed to some-
thing like the Vietnam Memorial.
You cry for another reason.”

On Thursday, around 240
middle school students came to
view the Quilt. “When they came
in, they were acting like kids, laugh-
ing and joking,” says Ross, “but
suddenly they became completely
silent. You could see the way that
it affected them.” 5

Davidson IB student Michelle
Morgan was overwhelmed. “Each
one of the panels is something to
everyone. It’s really touching —it
shows you how many people have
died.”

Her friend Caitlin Boon adds,
“Tt’s amazing how much work they
put in. It was probably good re-
covery for them.”

Last spring, sophomore Sara
Smith’s father died of AIDS. She
helped to make a panel, and it was
displayed. “If the Quilt had come
last spring, I would have been a
mess. I was so angry. But now is
the perfect time; it really helps me
to grieve. It has been easier than I
ever would have imagined it, anda
lot of it has to do with open and

understanding people.”

One sophomore sees the panel
as a celebration. “I think that it is
important that we see the Quilt as
a commemoration of life rather
than death.”

Currently, there are more than
360,000 Americans with AIDS,
and more than 220,000 have died.
The Quilt represents only 12% of
these cases.

The NAMES Project esti-
mates that they receive 50 new
panels a week. In 1996, the Quilt
will be displayed in its entirety in
Washington. “We intend to show
it every four years there,” says,
John Owens, NAMES staff mem-
ber and Davidson Quilt Display
Coordinator. “We will never stop
accepting panels.”

rience from that but lots of fun!”
The models’ attire was varied
and unique. There were partici-
pants dressed as cows, in their pa-
jamas, wearing lamp shades, wear-
ing cultural attire, and even the
Wildcat mascot. Court Savage,
Assistant Professor of Art, dressed
in foundry ware — what he actu-
ally wears in the VAC.
Dougherty says, “We made a
lot of money, and it was a big
success, The campus really got
together to support FLAG and it
was certainly a great experience.
Our purpose was really twofold.
We wanted to make some money,
but we also really wanted to create
some solidarity of the campus fora

common cause — ultimately for.

homo/bisexuality.”

The proceeds will go to create
a FLAG scholarship, to Time Out
Youth (Charlotte’s gay and les-
bian youth support/advocacy
group), and to the Metrolina AIDS
Project.

The participants seemed ex-
tremely enthusiastic about the idea.
Ryan Harper, representing the
Development Office, says, “I’m

just glad to be a part of helping
raise money to end the misunder-
Standing about AIDS.” Francis
Mitchell of the Computer Center
agrees: “It looks like it’s gonna be
a lot of fun, and I’m really glad to
be doing it!”

Sociology Professor Janet Sh-
annon says, “I think this is a very
important thing. I’m glad the stu-
dents are taking the initiative, and
I’m happy to support any effort in
their involvement to broaden the
awareness of AIDS on the
Davidson campus.” z

From the music department,
Joanna Davis likes the freedom of
expression for the models partici-
pating. Says Davis, “I like the idea
that it gives people a chance to be
creative on an individual basis and
really express themselves in their
own way.”

Junior Jill Dyer ‘represented
Connor House, and says, “I think
it’s for a great cause, and it’s been
so much fun. Everyone really
wants one night in their life where
they can epitomize their wildest
dreams and fantasies, and people
here are certainly doing it!”
