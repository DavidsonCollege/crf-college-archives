WITH

JEARL

In the two years that I have served as Sports Editor
of THE DAVIDSONIAN, I have probably used this
column less than any of my predecessors. I have
always felt that the paper should try to let the athletic
department, including administrators, players and
coaches, speak for itself.

Still, after two and a half years behind press ben-
ches, outside coaches offices. on Chambers first floor
-and on fields and courts from New York to Greenville,
S. C., I can’t help but have some ideas about the
problems confronting Davidson athletics and some
concepts about where the Cats should try to go in the
future.

In its own way, Davidson is a jock school. A tenth of
the student body is involved with football, and more
than a quarter involved in other varsity sports. Over
250 students are presently participating in IMAC
basketball ( there are 45 teams on the books).

Still, sports activities at this school are constantly
under attack. These attacks are basically healthy--
they keep the boys in the gym honest--but often they
are waged with a passion that turns a committee into
a posse to carry out some student's or administrator's
personal vendetta.

Obviously, the biggest area*of concern on campus is
the area of subsidized football. From time im-
memorial, it seems, students and faculty members
have been trying to run the Cat gridders out of David-
son.

I do not presume to offer a defense of the football
program. Personally I enjoy it, but I recognize that
there is more at stake here than a desire to offer
Saturday afternoon entertainment.

But before everyone takes. up the mantra of ‘‘end
subgjdized football," there are a great number of
variables to be considered. The basic question is why
would any school sponsor a football program, especi-
ally now when football has become big business?

The obvious answer is that it serves the academic
community in a way no other program is able to serve
it. Football offers a means for advertising for the
school, a point on thich the alumni can focus,a source
of pride for the students and finally a means for
diversifying the student population.

Despite their won-lost record, the Davidson team
has been able to do these things. Those who doubt the
team's ability to unify the students and interest the
alumni need only check the stands during any home
game. There are a lot more students at a fooball game
than there are at any symposium, lecture or cultural
event, even when personalities like Ramsay Clark
and Allen Ginsberg are available.

I feel that football has a long way to go
organizationally toward improving itself. The
operation. is big and bulky. But, if the Wildcat Fund
works, the answer is not to dump the sport, but rather
to work with Dave Fagg and Tom Scott to improve it.

The second major area of tension is the treatment
of minor sports. If football can stand some trimming.
and it certainly can, then baseball, tennis and
especially soccer can stand some beefing up.

These sports have been considered in a relatively
off-hand way by some members of the Ad-
ministration, probably because they are not the big
business that football has become. This is outrageous.
These sports, again notably soccer, are major areas
of student interest and student involvement. The Ad-
ministration and faculty should be preased that
students find any facet of Davidson life so interesting
and should be trying to foster that interest.

Obviously, the initial way to do it is to hire a
soccer coach. It can be done; money can be found
somewhere, perhaps even in the football budget.
The same principal holds for the tennis team. Jeff
Frank will undoubtedly do a good job, or so the tennis

=== Benton Takes Fourth Straight,

Leads Grapplers Over UNC

By JACK LINARD
Staff Writer

After winning his fourth con-
seculive match against UNC-
Chapel Hill Tuesday. Rob
Benton was told “‘not to let it go
to his head.”

He scoffed it off and pointed
out that the next meet would
be at Charleston, South
Carolina against The Citadel.
Virginia Military and Furman.

Having to wrestle three
times in one day. he could
possibly go against three fresh
opponents if VMI and The
Citadel have more than one

wrestler in Benton's 134 pound
weight class.

Davidson almost pulled a big
upset Tuesday against Chapel
Hill in Johnston Gymnasium.
After Rusty Winchester pinned
his opponent at 142 pounds,
Davidson had a 15-6 team lead.
The string ended there, for UNC
won the next five, three
by pins, to take a 30-21 victory
back to Chapel Hill.

Benton, who is a co-captain on
this year’s team, stated that the
reason for the collapse of the
heavier weights was not inex-
perience. but rather that most
of the wrestlers were actually

underweight.

With John Scandling ill and
John Kennelly overweight,
Davidson had to put two 142
pounders into the 150 and 158
pound weight classes.

Although they did ‘a’ sur-
prisingly good job.” according
to Benton, they could not cope
with the extra weight and were
pinned.

Benton's match against UNC
was not an exciting match to

watch because of his total
dominance.
Benton's opponent did not

initiate any moves ol his own.
as it would possibly have
opened himself up and made it
easier for Benton to pin him.

“IT was not up for the match
because I had already beaten
him before.” Benton said his
lackluster performance. ‘But I
was psyched for N.C. State last
Saturday. They beat me last
year pretty badly when T was
sick.”

Benton was the only Davidson
victor against State with a 12-1
thrashing of his opponent.

Benton only has four basic
moves, which he uses: the
stand-up. the switch, the
cradle. and the figure four on
the head.

The last two are his pinning
combinations, and although dif-
ficult to execute, they are sure
pins once he gets the hold.

Rob Jacobs picked up a vic-
tory when his opponent was
disqualified for stalling. Jacobs
was leading 9-0 at the time.

Rusty Winchester got what
Benton called *‘a rarity,’ when
he pinned his opponent in the
second period.

Bill Garrett upped his record
to 3-1 with a third period pin
over a much lighter UNC
wrestler.

The Wildcats’ next home meet
is Thursday against Pfeiffer
College, whom the ‘Cats
defeated earlier.

Club Booters Take 2 - 1 Win

In First Winter Season Game

By JIM SITTERSON
Asst. Sports Editor

Soccer never dies at David-
son. it just reverts to a club
sport in the winter. Following
the completion of the regular
season schecule. Tom Tornee
has organized a soccer club.

Despite a small squad. the
team has enjoved success in
their first outing, defeating the
Charlotte Soccer Club by a
score of two to one last week. A
rematch with the Charlotte club
is scheduled for this Sunday in
Charlotte. and the team has
other games scheduled — into
March. '

Tornee is encouraged by the
turnout and the first game. but
stressed that the club was not a
fulltime committment.

“We've had about 12-15 guys
show up for games and prac-
tices so far. We practice on
Tuesday and Thursday al-
ternoons for a couple of hours.”
Tornee said.

Tornee felt’ that) the best
aspects of the club were that it
provided varsity team) mem-
bers with a chance to practice.
as well as giving inexperienced
players a chance to play soccer.

Tornee was very pleased with
the performances of several
players who have never played

soccer at Davidson before.

“A lot of these new guys are
freshmen who have never
played in a high level of com-
petion before and were a little
reluctant to go out for the
team,” Tornee explained.

“I think that they were a little
shy at first. because they were
plaving against the varsity or
guys who had played varsity.
After a while though. they began
to show some conficence and
now they're playing good soc-
cer.” Tornee said.

The freshmen cited by Tornee
inparticular were Dave Richard-
son. Horace Drew. and Dan
Thorpe. Tornee added that he
would like to see them and
several other freshmen come
out for the team next vear.

In encouraging prospective
players to come out and join the
club, Tornee once again men-
tioned that the club was run ona
very informal basis and added
that there were no dues and that
the club provides uniforms for
the team.

Tornee requested that anyone
Who. played on the varsity this
fall and had some extra time.
should join the club in order to
practice and to help

newcomers. Tornee admitted
that so far has been a little
disappointed in the turnout by
veterans from this year's team.
