WALT attempts to revive; DCTV re-organizes

By Russ Tarver and Mary

WALT ~

For several years, students
have been trying to start a radio
station that would provide an alter-
native to the classical station
WDAV. Under the call letters
WALT, the station would air mu-
sic catering to students and might
even act as a forum for student
commentary.

In October of the 1992-93
school year, a group of students
began holding weekly meetings in
order to discuss the possibilities of
such a station. College Union Di-
rector William Brown wrote a
memo about the student interest to
Dean Terry, suggesting that the
matter be further examined. Terry
responded by supporting the for-
mation of an official committee
involving faculty, staff, students,
and representatives from WDAV.

The committee met for the
first time on March 29 of this year.
Brown explains the purpose of the
committee as being to “define
clearly the mission of the station,
as to who we’re trying to reach and
what we’ re trying to accomplish.”

“When I came here as a fresh-
man, I expected there to be a stu-
dent alternative station,” says
Catherine Rivenbark, student
member of the WALT committee.

“Most colleges I knew had them.
All we had was a classical one.”

Her interest in the communi-
cations field pushed her to pursue
projects involving the founding of
such a station. She worked at
WDAYV as an announcer but “re-
ally wanted to work with music
other than classical.”

Brown, Rivenbark and the rest
of the committee are weighing the
options of airing the station. Meth-
ods discussed include FM, AM,
cable and carrier-current. They
are working to “take the best ad-
vantage of the energy that people
have, at the most reasonable cost,”
said Brown.

“The people who want to have
a station want to have it today,”
says Brown. “I’m not criticizing
that, but what we need to dois back
up a bit and do some homework.”

Student representative Brad
Hilsmier says that the committee
is a“‘very positive step in the direc-
tion of forming a successful sta-
tion.” Brown encourages anyone
interested in the development of
WALT to direct their ideas to him
or any other member of the com-
mittee. Committee members in-
clude students Bob Feezor,
Churchill Hooff, Alison
Woodward, Brian Luskey, and
Derek Judson; and Davidson Col-

Davidson’s Video Program-
ming Committee gets a fresh start
with freshman Martin Young run-
ning the show. Young is leading
an effort to increase participation
in the committee, to jump-start
some old traditions, and to create
new ones. Every year, DCTV films
graduation, composes the video
yearbook, and does various con-
tract work, including video editing
and renting out equipment. The
committee will continue this kind
of work because the income which

it raises meets DCTV’s annual ©

budget needs.

In addition, Young would like
to bring back the enthusiastic stu-
dent participation of years past.
Former chairman, junior Andy
Cole, remembers a time when
DCTYV events were frequent, popu-
lar, and included broadcasting
through acable station on campus.
Programming included creative
films and weekly announcements.
“Broadcasting over air is what
people keep asking for,” saysCole,
“but that takes time and manpower
that a volunteer group of students
really doesn’t have.”

Young realizes that “broad-
casting is really a job for a profes-
sional,” but he has plans to stir up

student interest and involvement.
Heis considering reviving the once
popular televised bingo games. In
the past, Bingo games aired live
from the Union pit while students
played in lounges and senior apart-
ments on cards provided by DCTV.
Winners called in to win prizes.
Other DCTV plans to attract
crowds include study breaks fea-
turing student-produced skits,
sports news, or other videos. At-
tendance at the first of such breaks,

held several weeks ago in the Big
Screen Room, demonstrated stu-
dent enthusiasm for the idea. The
committee is planning two more
breaks before the semester ends.

The call for more program-
ming is one that Young hopes can
be answered in the future, He says
“Although it would take many vol-
unteers to film, edit, and change
tapes, [hope DCTV can work up to
about two hours of programming a
night.”

Phi Delt plays golf to support ALS

By David Christopherson
On Sunday, April 24, Phi Delta
Theta held. its. inaugural Charity
Golf. Tournament at the Mallard
Head Country Club. $1,800 was
raised for the ALS Association of
North Carolina. Amyotrophic lat-
eral sclerosis is more commonly
known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease,
named for its most famous victim.

romuscular disease affects one in
every 100,000 adults. The life
expectancy for its victims is gener-
ally two to five years, and there is

no known cure for the disease.
June Thompson, President of
the North Carolina chapter of the
ALS Association, attended the
event and said it was “the first time
there’s been such a golf tourna-
ment, and we’re really pleased.”
. Thompson said the money raised
will be used for research, as well as
for equipment and services, such
as walkers, communication aids,

and respite care for ALS patients.
Bob Swann, an ALS patient, was
“also in attendance. He has defied
the odds by living for eleven years
with the disease. He credits his
wife, Barbara, for his success.
Tournament director Bob
Bailey ‘96 said the day was a suc-
cess and was happy with the com-
munity support of the project.
Numerous local businesses spon-
sored and participated in the event.
Following the tournament a recep-
tion and awards ceremony was held
at the Phi Delt house. The winning
team was captained by Brian
Wickenden ‘96 who shot a nine-
under-par in the captain’s choice

format. Bailey said, “Fraternities

have a tendency to get a bad. repu-
tation, but on days like today, I’m

proud to be a part of the fraternity
system at Davidson.”
