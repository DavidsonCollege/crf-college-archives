THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 28, 1927

VIRGINIA AGGREGATION

(Continued from page 1)

In the games this season they have been
showing up well and while comparative
scores mean absolutely nothing, they may be
used here to give an idea of the strength of
the two teams. V. M. I. defeated the Wof-
ford College team 37-0 in the opening game
and followed with a 22-0 victory over Rich-
mond University. They next suffered de-
feat at the hands of Georgia Tech by a 7-0
margin, coming back to win from Roanoke
32-0. The past week-end they were downed
by Maryland 10-6. From these scores it
looks as though they have been having a very
good season.

The Davidson record is well known in
this section and has also been good. They
have booked four games in the win column
and have had one tie. The Wildcat team has

been in bad condition during the past week,
" due to many injuries. Harrison, with a
strained leg, and Melton, with a dislocated
shoulder, both acquired in the Wake Forest
game, are the outstanding new injuries. Mc-
Colgan, who has been on the bench for the
past two weeks, is rounding. into shape and
will probably take part in the game. Piggy.
Wearn was out the last game, but it is gen-
erally thought that he will be in shape: this
week. Hampton, varsity center, has been out
with a weak ankle. .With a week to work
into shape, most of these men are hoping to
be ready jor the game with V. M. I.

The Cadets are reported to be in good
shape after the game with Maryland last Sat-
urday, and will be ready for anything that
the Wildcats may do to foil them, while the
Wildcats will be equally anxious to pull a
surprise upon the Cadets and put them on
the march,

With a, crowd on hand that will probably
number over ten thousand, and the two
teams in fine mettle combined with a great
spirit between the two schools proven by the
