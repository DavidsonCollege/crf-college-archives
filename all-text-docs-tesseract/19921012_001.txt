Alpha Phi Alpha Set to Open
Davidson to Get First Traditionally

African-American Fraternity

By Sean Lind

On Monday, October 5, rep-
resentatives from Davidson met
with spokesmen from the Alpha
Phi Alpha national organization to
lay the groundwork for the estab-
lishment of the Davidson Sigma
Tau chapter of the fraternity.

This past June, Alpha Phi Al-
pha formally accepted Davidson’s
bid to have a chapter of the frater-
nity.

Because the decision by the
National was made during the sum-
mer, some Davidson students were
notaware of the development. This
has caused a slight delay in the
organization and opening of the
fraternity. As yet, there is no spe-
cific date for the opening of A Phi
A, although it should begin activi-
ties sometime in January.

Alpha Phi Alpha, the nation’s
oldest traditionally Afro-American
fraternity, was founded December
4, 1906 at Cornell University. The
original organization was begun in
1905 asa literary society and A Phi
A has strived to maintain this origi-
nal focus.

Alpha Phi Alpha looks to pro-
mote scholarship, service, and cul-
ture. Unlike other national frater-
nities on campus, A Phi A has a
GPA requirement of 2.5. This is
considerably higher than the
college’s mandated 2.0.

Alpha Phi Alpha is a lifetime
organization. They have graduate
chapters and a networking system
to help members personally and
socially throughout their lives.

“The Origin of Alpha Phi Al-
pha” describes the fraternity’s dif-

ficult beginning: “This was not an
easy task for the group of young
men who were endeavoring to fol-
low the vision of a permanent fra-
ternal organization. The dream
seemed so easy, but the task was
more difficult. They were quite
unacquainted with the organiza-
tion and procedure of college fra-
ternities, for not one of them had
the privilege of membership in a
similar organization.”

The students at Davidson

faced a similar situation. The | ~

tedious process of getting the fra- :
ternity on campus took nearly four *

years. Before they could apply to
the National A Phi A chapter, stu-
dents had to receive college ap-
proval. They had to petition and

Debate Arises Over Baker Hours
Part of New Alcohol Policy Yet to be Implemented

By Tom Price

Curt Cassidy, a sophomore
SGA representative, has asked that
the Athletics Council subcommit-
tee examine the possibility of ex-
panding the operating hours of
Baker Sports Complex.

Cassidy created a proposal
which he presented ata SGA meet-
ing on Tuesday, September 29. In
the proposal, Cassidy refers to the
new Davidson alcohol policy
which made specific references to
expanding the hours of campus
social outlets.

On Page 1 of the “Introduc-
tion to the Alcohol Policy,” the
document reads, “Baker Sports
Complex should remain open (in-
cluding the equipmentroom) from
7 am. until 12 midnight seven

days a week. There should be
provisions for planned activities at
the sports complex on a regular
basis as well as spontaneous ac-
tivities.”

The Alcohol Policy states that
the new hours should be imple-
mented “to encourage a campus
climate which does not tolerate
alcohol abuse” and “to change the
social expectations of the campus
and develop a more creative,
healthy and social environment.”

Despite these recommenda-
tions, Baker Sports Complex cur-
rently closes at six o’clock on Fri-
daysandeleveno’clock every other
night. The equipment room cur-
rently closes every night at six
o’clock.

The Athletics Council, which

is co-chairéd by “Elizabeth
McLaughlin and Matt Dormer, has
discussed Cassidy’s proposal dur-
ing their last two meetings and will
continue to discuss it in the future.
McLaughlin said that the Council
has recommended expanding the
hours to 10 o’clock on Fridays on
a trial basis.

Greg Fisher, a member of the
Council, said that they had dis-
cussed the issue with two mem-
bers of the athletic department, Pat
Millen and John Beyer. Millen
and Beyer cited two problems with
expanding hours: the question of
whether students would use the
facility more and the need for addi-
tional funding to hire workers.

Russian Deputy _
Foreign Minister
Speaks at Davidson

Sergei Lavrov Talks

on Russian

Foreign Policy in the Modern World

By Robin Pepper

Sergei V. Lavrov, the deputy
foreign minister of the Russian Fed-
eration, spoke in the Gallery of
Chambers on Tuesday, October 6.
Sponsored by Davidson’s Dean
Rusk Program in International
Relations, the topic of his speech
was “Russian Foreign Policy in
the Modem World.”

The Russian Foreign Minister
spoke candidly about the current
Status of his country. He is encour-
aged by the progress of reforms in
his country but realizes that the
events there. do no constitute a “to-
tal victory for democracy.”

Lavrov stressed Russia’s de-
sire to become a “normal country
and protect our national interest.”
Security, territorial integrity, eco-
nomic stability, and humanitarian
rights were among the priorities he
listed for the newly democratic
society in Russia.

One of the major difficulties
currently facing Russia, Lavrov
said, is the reemergence of nation-
alism. He explained that during
the Cold War the borders separat-
ing the various republics were

merely administrative. Now,
Lavrov said, the new state borders
have becomereal national borders.
This transition has led to the re-
emergence of nationalistic feelings
which had been previously ‘“‘fro-
zen” in the old U.S.S.R. Lavrov
feels that the Confederation will
be strengthened by the protection
of human rights of all the nation-
alities living within it.

Lavrov believes the key to the
successful growth of democracy
within Russia is economic reform.
While there is “no proven text-
book way to move from a central-
ized economy to a market
economy,” Lavrov believes that it
is feasible with the support of other
democratic countries. Russia hopes
to use “expertise available in the
outside world to expedite reform,”
and new monetary and credit poli-
cies will bring inflation under con-
trol. “Russia will solve its prob-
lems,” Lavrov said, and become
serious economic competitorsonce
again.

Lavrov also stressed the im-
