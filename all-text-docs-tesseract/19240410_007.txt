rise in the professional world, of his work
with the Near East Relief in Armenia fol-
lowing the war, and, for the past two years,

THOMAS W. DIXON DIES IN
CHARLOTTE

Thomas W. Dixon, a native of Mecklen-

vicinity of Charlotte, died Wednesday morn-
ing with an acute heart attack. He was an
active business man in the Carolinas, or-

usual zeal,

He entered Davidson College in 1873 and
graduated ‘in 1877. He was a fine student
and respected by all. During his scholastic
training at Davidson he was thrown with
Woodrow Wilson, who was a student here
at the same time. After his graduation he
entered the hardware business and from
that time on he has upheld his high ideals
gained ‘at Davidson. His large circle of
friends are very grieved over his death, but
no higher tribute can be paid to him than
to say, “He was loved by all.”

and their wives were invited guests.

The excellent film, Little Old New
York, starring Marion Davies was an
added attraction Saturday evening at the
gymnasium. The jazz orchestra was un-
able to furnish music for the occasion
due to the fact that it had a previous
engagement in Lenoir.

The most of Sunday was spent in the
halls by the guests and their escorts, the
weather not permitting much
activity. All the girls present were popu-
lar
a dull time. Monday morning saw
departure of most of the young ladies,
who no dougt already

In the mind of every serious
thinking college man there arises a
question—"What am I going to do
after graduation?” This question
presents a serious crisis. It de-
mands a definite decision.

In an unusual degree the Life
Insurance business combines the
opportunity for conspicuous bus-
iness success with the opportunity
for real social service. Here is a
profession that is eminently worthy
of consideration.
