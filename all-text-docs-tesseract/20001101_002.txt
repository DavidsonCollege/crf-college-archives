Subgroups play crucial role in ‘SGA affairs, contribute to success

By Jessica MERING

Staff Writer

The SGA Senate is responsible for a con-
siderable amount of action on campus. As a
fairly large body, however, it delegates its
responsibility to three types of subgroups:
committees, councils, and student advisory
councils.

There are ten committees that carry out
many of the responsibilities of the Senate.
The Senate Bylaws contain some stipulations
about their structure and dictate whether the
chair(s) must be chosen from among the
elected senators.

The Vice-President of the Senate, currently
Joey Harris ’02, is responsible for appointing
a chair, or co-chairs, of the committees, and
the Senate then approves his choices. Com-
mittee membership, however, is open to any
Davidson student. _

The committees include Charters and By-
laws, Trustee Contact, Phone-a-thon, Rides
(Vamanos), Roundtable, Leadership Train-
ing, Public Relations, Building Services
(Physical Plant) and Polling and Response,
all of which are permanent and function con-

tinuously throughout the year. Hy

While their activities are not always visible
to the student body, the function of the com-
mittees is crucial. The Phone-a-thon Com-
mittee, for example, coordinates student in-
volvement for the Department of Alumni
Affairs annual fundraising.

“It’s a very important fundraiser for the
students to take part in,” said Susanne Francis
’03, chair of the committee. “Not only do we
raise money, but it’s a way to keep in contact
with the alumni. Generally, they really enjoy
hearing from current students and like to keep
in contact with the school,”

The Senate forms an ad hoc committee
when a new need arises that a current com-
mittee does not address. These committees
concentrate on specific issues and usually
function to explore different options and make
a recommendation for action. After the SGA
or an administrator makes a decision on the
issue, the ad hoc committee disbands.

For

™ example, an ad hoc committee considered
cable in dorm rooms last year.

SGA councils also exist and operate in a
similar manner as the committees. These
subgroups are generally smaller and more
specific than committees, and SGA President
Dane Erickson ’01 appoints the chairs.

The Elections Council is responsible for
the operation of all student elections and
organizes both candidate activity as well as
student voting. The Council on Minority Af-
fairs is especially active around Martin Luther
King Day but also sponsors forums and lec-
tures to address a variety of minority issues

regarding race, gender and other similar is-
sues. The Council on Internet and Technol-
ogy Advancement maintains the SGA website
and addresses technology needs.

Finally, Student Advisory Councils (SACs)
are small groups that act as student liaisons to
campus officials. These include the advisory
councils to RLO, the Director of Campus
Safety, Auxiliary Services, the Director of
Athletics, and the Dean of Faculty. The Vice-
President of the Senate appoints these chairs
as well. SACs are critical to conveying stu-
dent opinion to administrators:

“We owe it to the people who put us in

office to make sure their voices are heard,”
said Harris.

These subgroups are all accountable to the
Senate. Harris, as Vice-President, oversees
them, and the groups are responsible for
giving periodic reports on their activity at
SGA meetings. Their functioning is essential
to the success of the SGA.

“Without committees, councils, and advi-
sory councils, we’d be a social club — people
sitting around and talking but not doing,” said
Hatris. “These are the mechanisms through
which we get things done.”

Debate,
from page I

ing judges that are strict constructionists,
“not legislating from the bench.”

Kristine Harrington ’03 countered that the
“Constitution is not a static document and
must grow with our country.” She was wary
of Bush’s- philosophy of appointing right-
leaning justices and its potential threats to
free speech and the Roe v. Wade decision.

Much of the debate reflected the differ-
ences in policy between Gore and Bush.
Even so, thé debate did not lack questions
concerning the character, experience, and
track record of each candidate.

Kevin Epps ’03 of the College Republicans
questioned the success of the Clinton/Gore
Administration in health care policy.

“They had their chance; they have not led.
We will,” said Epps.

The Young Democrats countered criticisms
against Gore, questioning Bush’s experience
in foreign policy.

The Republicans, lead by John Pitts ’04,
steadfastly defended Bush’s competence in
foreign policy. Pitts, in an emphatic and
passionate statement, asserted Bush’s “vi-
sion and leadership” that Gore lacks.

The two organizations also answered sev-
eral questions from the audience.

The evening saw a crowd that grew as high
as 200. There were enough seats for 100, but

we throw all kinds of

[obstacles] «: yu.

tuition isn't one of then.

Sure, we'll have you climbing walls. But if you qualify for
a 2- or 3-year scholarship, tuition’s one obstacle you won't
have to worry about. Ta/k to an a ROTC rep. And get a

leg upon your future.

there still was a good crowd both sitting and
standing behind
these chairs.

- Many listeners
were divided on
which side won
their vote after the
debate. For some,
the Democrats and
Gore dominated
every issue, and
likewise for the Re-
publicans and
Bush.

For others, the
winners were di-
vided depending
on the issue. Matt
Zogby ’02 felt that
there was no clear
winner for all is-
sues, although he
felt that the
“Democrats won
the environmentis-
sue.”

Overall, both the
Young Democrats
and the College
Republicans were
happy about cam-
pus response to the debates.

Brandt Leibe ‘02, co-president of the Col-

Kevein Epps addresses the
opposition at the debates -

lege Republicans, believed that the debates

. showed the college
community “the dif-
ferences between
‘the candidates.”

Mark Cody ‘01,
president of the
Young Democrats,
agrees. “It’s won-
derful. [The debate]
helps to get the is-
sues out to the stu-
dents.”

Rick Bold ‘02,
co-president of the
College Republi-
cans, believed that
the turnout at the de-
bate was a sign that
“political life is
alive on Davidson’s
campus.”

President Vagt
couldn’t be happier
about the debate.

“It was a magical
moment - the set-
ting was spectacu-
lar; the debaters
were thoughtful, ar-
ticulate and pas-

sionate; and, the crowd was great. It was a
special night.”
