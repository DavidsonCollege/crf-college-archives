Slim brown ankles

said, laughing into his glass, then

asked her to finish the dance.

Pretty little thing let me light
your candle :
Cause Mamma I’m sure hard
to handle, now yes I am.

I make my way over to the

college table and take my time
getting their drink order so I can
listen to what the ape haired man
wants her to do. Ihave to ask them
if they need anything a couple of
times before the backward hat boy
takes time out from staring at Maria
to order two more pitchers and a
round of typical tequila shots. Until
the song’s over, Maria’s center
Stage wherever she goes.

“Why’d you put your top back
on?” He asks with a thick slur.

“So I can take it off for you.”

“Well you’re not taking it off
for me darling, your taking it off
for my wife.”

“Come on Jim,” the idiot says,
“Jet’s not do this.”

“NowdammitI already waved
her over here.” He says, and Maria
slowly rubs her nose, doing her
damndest to cover her smile.

“Let her dance for you.” The
idiot says. “You're the one who
wanted to come here in the first
place.” The bastard just stared at
her with anger and a smile swim-
ming together in his dark liquored

who was all filled with curiosity.”
He says.
~ “I just wanted to know why...
“Don’t you wanta close look?
Don’t you want to try and under-
stand? Isn’t that what you said?”

- He rubs his hairy fingers on her

leg.

“Hell, ’ll try and watch. That
enough?” She asks.

He lights a cigarette, a
Marlboro man, and waves the bill
again. The poor idiot finishes her
drink. 3

‘‘We’ve seen enough of your
chest, how bout turning around for
my wife. And could you grab your
calves every once in a while?”

Give it to me baby,
I got to have it,
Some of your love

The singer draws “love” out in
a long sick note. Maria laughs as
she turns around for the. happy
couple. You can’t help but laugh
when love’s dying all around.

The smash of the last cymbal
and the Nomads head for the bar.
“What are you doing?” He tries to
shove his seat back and stand
straight up but the table stops him.

“Song’s over sweety.” She °

says. “So’s the stage dance.”

. “That’s fine, but this hundred
is for a table dance. Hell I’ll even
get the band to play the same frig-

‘gin song.” The stereo kicks in.
One of those songs with electric —

drums you hear at dance clubs.
The girls come on out: stage-danc-
ing, table-dancing, wandering

would like a hundred.” He says
smiling.

“Rest of the song, darling?”
Maria asks.

“Two at the most. Oh, and
don’t forget about the calves.”

“My pleasure.”

“Darling,” he’s looking at me,
“two, no, three more scotch and
waters.”

I’d love to slowly pour thcse
pitchers into his bastard eyes. If I
was Maria I’d take my top off,
throw it in his face, and tell him to
do the dance. Leave this damned
place topless, leveveryone see they
don’t matter. i

But Maria turns around and
moves her backside to half the
beat. Each time Maria grabs her
calves she’s probably telling her-

- self she’s catching her breath. She
better be thinking of something .

else.

Tim yells to me from across
the bar with his jolly round smile.
As I walk toward him I look over
my shoulder to see the bastard
handing his wife some money and
pointing at Maria’s G-string. To
the side of them the backward hat
boy, with his money in mouth,
motions he wants Maria’s top off,
and the shy boy next to him is still.
playing with the foam in his beer.

“It looked like you were need- >

ing to get away from that.” Tim
says. He’saregular. Redcheeked.
We call him Saint Nick. He was
here when I first started dancing.
“Can you believé that?” I ask.
“Maybe I just didn’t have time to
notice this shit when I was strip-

ping.”

too long or hard. But I agree with
you. If a man can get a woman he
has no business bringing her here.”

“What can I get you Tim?” I
ask, glad to laugh. “I can see
you’ re already feeling philosophi-
cal.”

“Nothing really. Well, how
bout a bourbon. Sure, why not a
bourbon. Think we should get
Thomas the bouncer to keep an eye
on them.” .

“She'll be all right.” say.

By the time I get back to Tim
with his bourbon, the idiat, is sit-
ting by herself sipping on another
scotch. Part of mé would like to

ask and tell her a few things, but _

it’s really none of my business. A
slow song comes onand I’m happy
to say the Nomads may be through
for the night.

“Here you go Mr. Tim.”

“Thank you Ms. Al.

The dancers lead their partners
up on stage for what may be the last
slow dance of the night. And there
is Maria hand in hand with him,
guiding him up the stage steps,
while his idiot sits and watches,
Maria tosses her top on the floor, I
imagine that red wine sweater is
rough, and then she laughs. God
dammit she laughs. He has to be
paying her to laugh like that, just
like he has to have paid her to
throw-her top away. Bastard must
be trying to teach his wife some
sort of lesson about control.

I’mafraid for her. Seems they
haven’t learned a damn thing.

Jennifer leads a crippled man
in a wheelchair to the stage. His
buddies, whoaren’tin uniform but

weight from one foot to the other
with a smile and the crippled man
uscs his arms to do whcclies, back
and forth side to side, Icaning back
like he’s on the ends of a rocking
chair. He comes close to falling a
couple of times but doesn’t. He
laughs each time and each time his
army ‘buddics laugh with him. I
imagine Jennifer will choose
“Faith” after tonight’s dance. I try
and smile at this.

“Hey Al,” asks Tim, “why did
you stop dancing?” I pretend not
to hear him and take a sip from his
becr. I look past’ Maria and the
bastard, and past the crippled man
and “Faith,” and I stareat the Ellens.

Each night beneath the stage’s
hot lights Rachel Ellen slowly and
quictly unbuttons her own blouse, _
tonight it’s the yellow one with the
faded white flowers, and then she
allows ‘her braless breasts to sag
and press against one of Hal’s
polyester shirts, tonightit’s the blue
one. Each night they look into
each others pink eyes, and each
night they look a little drunk anda
little inlove. Andhe never touches
her breasts as if they belong to a
Paper Doll. The owners, Mark our
manager, and the dancers have
always overlooked the Ellen’s
dance. And I have never under-
stood it, -And I have never asked.
