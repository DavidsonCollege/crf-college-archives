THE STUDENT COUNCIL.

What after all is the real purpose and
position of the Student Council in the
life and government of the Student
Body.

“The Students’ Council shall have
jurisdiction to receive, prefer and try
any charges against any student for a
violation of the provisions of the consti-
tution; they shall have power and it is
their duty to investigate rumors injur-
ious to the Student Body or any mem-
ber thereof, to the end that the good
name of the Student Body may be main-
tained, the transgressors redeemed from
the error of their ways, or prevented
from further casting reproach upon the
good name of the Student Body, or the
innocence of the guiltless made mani-
fest.”

Thus reads the constitution, and it ts
a good summary. Its purpose is three-
fold: to be a judicial body and try cases
of offence and violation of the constitu-
tion, to be a legislative body and ine
prove and formulate new laws to suit
new conditions, and to be an executive
body and enforce the laws and protect
the good name of the Student Body.

Theoretically this is a fine scheme, but
is it actually a success? When compared
with Faculty Ruling it is certainly a
success, yet it must be admitted it falls
far short of what it might be. And this
failure, if we can. call it a failure, is due
to no weakness in the system, but to a
misconception and unfortunate attitude
of the students as a whole.

“You had better stop paddling that
Freshman. Yonder comes a Student
Councilman,” some one was heard to
remark not long ago, and it typifies the
three main misconceptions of the aver-
age student in regard to student govern-
ment.

First, the Student Council is consid-
cred a police svstem or a detective force,
which is on the outlook for transgres-
sors to ship. Yet, according to our
honor system, every man should be a po-
liceman, and be just as responsible for
the punishment of the one who violates
laws or uphold the fair name’ of — the
Student Body, as any member of the
Student Council.

Second, the Council’s purpose is not
only to punish but to correct, not only
to expell and suspend but to reform.

The DAVIDSONIAN, March 14, 1917

To the Freshman or Sophomore whc
‘hru ignorance or environment begin:
his college career “sowing wild oats.”
the Council is not a tyrant but a broth-
erly adviser, a friendly correcter.

And third, the Student Body must
work in harmony with the Student
Council, back it up, respect its laws,
discountenance those who break them.
and insist on and assist in the immediate
punishment of the transgressors. Then
and only then can it be a success.

The Honor System and Self-govern-
ment are the best plans ever devised for
student government. May they not fail
thru any misconception or thoughtless
opposition of students.

DR. MACK FILLED
PULPIT LAST SUNDAY

The local Presbyterian pulpit was
filled on last Sunday by Dr. Fdward
Mack, of Union Theological Seminary,
who gave two very interesting and in-
structive sermons.

The text for the morning service
was from T Cor. 16:33, “Watch ye,
stand fast in the faith, quit ye like men.
he strong.” The duty laid upon all
professing Christians is to bring about
Christ’s kingdorn and it is only thru
efficient service for Him that we can
hest do our share in the work. The text
is a challenge to keep ourselves fit in
body, mind and spirit for the service of
God, and that one who defiles his body.
dissipates his energies. and blackens his

heart, is a traitor to God’s cause. Purity] -

of life and thought is therefore the first
essential.

The second essential is righteousness,
which is higher than love itself, for it
includes the latter. The crowning ex-
ample of a lack of this essential, which
was given by Dr. Mack, is the present
selfish struggle in Europe. The third
challenge of the text is love—not the
love of a mother for her child or that of
the husband for his wife, but the love of
humanity and of God and His cause
which must stand above and suncrior to
all other loves in the true Christian.

The evening sermon was based on
the book of Fecclesiastes. which the
speaker denominated the Old Testa-
ment message to young men, saying at
the same time that it was one of the

four books of Hebrew philosophy which!

is based, not on abstract reasoning, but
upon experimental results. He then
gave an outline of the book in five parts,
or cycles of thought: (1) The vanity
of wisdom, pleasure and labor, with a
plea for the simpler life: (2) The van-
itv of human justice, ambition and
riches, with the call to the fight against
selfishness: (3) The vanity of surplus
of good things; (4) The call for prac-
tical wisdom: (5) A psalm of youth.
which concludes with the admonition to
follow the commandments and teachings
ot God for our lives.

Did you ever stop to think
of the direct advantages to be gained from
printing that will catch the eye and hold it longe@
enough to create a favorable attitude on the part of
the buying public? Printing of the ordinary kind
has become so weatherbeaten by unlimited usage
that the impression formed in the mind of the busi-
ness man of to-day is one of continuous and depress-
ing sameness—a tendency to cause 9 look-
around-more”’ disposition on the part of him who
wants something just a little diffekent, if not entirely
distinctive, when compared with the current station-

ry that reaches his office.
