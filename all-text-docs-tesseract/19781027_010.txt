If the ‘there and now’”’ is
getting you down, get away to
the “then and there’”’ with the
drama department's fall prod-
uction of ‘Moliere’s comedy,
“The Miser.”

When asked to comment on
the play,
director, immediately respon-
ded, “It’s fun!’’ He added that
the set and costumes go toge-

Barber is also pleased with

unfamiliar with Moliere, ‘he is
considered to be the Shake-
speare of France.

The plot of the play is an
intricate ohe in which many
characters often seem to be
bordering on disaster, usually
because of the miser, Harpa-
gon. But the play is a comedy,
and the ending miraculously
ties all the loose ends together.
and solves all the problems.

As this is the first 17th
century play our department
has done, few costumes could be
pulled from stock, Barber ob-
served. Several ornate cost-
umes had to be made from
scratch. These costumes as well
as the set were designed by
Joseph Gardner, drama profes-

BRAD CHRISTIE, a veteran of Davidson theatre and the miser in the
cutrent production, scolds Bunny Horine, a newcomer to the Davidson
stage and a matchmaker in tonight’s production.
