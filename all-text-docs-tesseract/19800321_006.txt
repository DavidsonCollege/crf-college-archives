International students find Davidson small,

By JEFF STIDHAM
Staff Writer

This year, Davidson has been
host to nine international stu-
dents. Coming from different
backgrounds and cultures, they
have become close friends since
their arrival at Davidson. Now,
after two terms, they are pre-
. paring to leave Davidson, and
have formed some definite opin-
ions on their ‘‘Davidson exper-
ience.” _

Jose Lozano spent four years
at the polytechnical University
of Madrid before receiving his
scholarship to Davidson. His
study here has been interesting,
but he wishes that there had
been more group involvement in
the classroom. He is used to
more intensive classroom work
and more spare time away from
class. ‘‘In Spain we have more
classes, but people study less. I
have seven hours of classes
every day. I study one hour
every day.” Part of Lozano’s
spare time has been spent
playing for the Davidson soccer
team which is the last recreation
he will have for a while, since he
will join the army when he
returns to Spain in June.

Toshimutsu Kamakura, a
Japanese international student,
comes to Davidson from Kobe
University. He spoke no Eng-
lish until this summer, when he
took intensive English courses
at the English language center
in Charlotte.

Kamakura knew very little
about the college when he
arrived, and was surprised by
the amount of time put into
studies. He speculates that
American high schools do not
prepare students for university
study in an efficient manner.
‘‘What you are learning (at
Davidson) is not very difficult,
I believe, because you all speak
English perfectly. I think you
do not learn much in high
school. In my country it is a big
deal to enter a university or
college so we study hard in
preparation. Once there, we
study maybe two or three hours
a week or a month.”

Kamakura has made many
friends at Davidson, but asserts
that “Davidson students don’t
know what social life is. They
have a party, but everything is
so scheduled. In Japan, every-
thing is very flexible.”

Michael Lochel, from West
Germany, first heard of David-
son from an advertisement at
the University of Marburg.
Although he has enjoyed Dav-
idson, he holds some reserva-
tions about it. ‘‘I wouldn’t send
my children here because I
don’t think the school is cre-
ative. I think it’s reproductive.
It demands too much work and
does not allow other experiences
or offer other perspectives to
prepare students for society.
There is no honor code in the
real world.”’

In his courses at Davidson,
Lochel has noticed more read-
ing, but he fears that classes
move so quickly that there is
not enough time to really learn.
“In literature courses in Ger-
many,” he hotes, “‘we read one
or two novels at most in a
semester. We also read second-
ary literature and get more
perspective. Our class sessions

are more intense.

Claire Moy came to Davidson
in November from the Univer-
site Paul Valery, in Montpellier,
France. At the time, she knew
very little about Davidson and
did not realize its Christian

emphasis. ‘‘Universities in

France are state controlled, not
private, so this is very new.”
She did not realize that David-
son is an isolated community,
and she misses the city.

Also, she said, ‘‘The people
here study too much and have-
n’t enough spare time.” She has
found students initially friend-

shy é t, ee
front of their dorm.

ly, but she noted that studies
and grades seem more impor-
tant at times. ‘‘One day you see
people and they are friendly,
then the next day I didn’t know
if I could see them again.” °
Like Moy, Patricia Boughaba
attends University Paul Valery
in Montpellier. She knew that
Davidson was a small town, but

‘was nevertheless surprised by

its size and disappointed by the
isolation.

Boughaba believes that the
emphasis of study here ‘‘is on
the amount of things learned.
In France, you concentrate your
efforts on something in particu-
lar.”

On social life, Boughaba com-
ments: ‘‘In France, there is not
really a social life because there
is no campus system.’’ She likes

the way activities are organized
for students and that there -

always seems to be something
to do. Sy

Living in Davidson has been
a good experience for Boug-
haba: “Being away causes you
to think about what your cul-
ture is. You reevaluate your
own system of values.”

Neil Churchill is a student at
the University of East Anglia,
in Norwich, England. His schol-
arship for Davidson study was
one of six offered by United
States colleges and universities.

He, like the other interna-

tional students, commented on
Davidson's size. “‘It is unfortu-
nate,’’ he said, ‘‘that most
international students are from
large cities. They are not in
good stead to face a place like
Davidson.”

‘work when I want.

Churchill claims he came to a
southern school ‘‘because I
wanted to be a country-western
star.”’ Although he has not yet
reached Nashville, he has been
working for the radio station.
“I’ve been able to play English
music which people in the states
don’t get to hear too often.”

Churchill has enjoyed his
freedom at Davidson. ‘‘I’ve not
been under a tremendous a-
mount of pressure. I’ve enjoyed
the courses I’ve taken here...
Everything is a new experience.
However, he also finds David-
son students to be too involved

with their studies. “The David-
son atmosphere breeds a stag-
nant opinion. I think people
should relax more and _ utilize
their social life to relax. More
people should come out of
themselves, be less inhibited."’

Lulu Kempster, the other
English international student,
had completed two years of
study at Reading University
before coming to Davidson. She
learned about the scholarship
through Davidson students at
Reading, but received very little
information about the school.
Upon arrival, however, she was
not disappointed. .‘‘I knew it
was small and out of the way,
but it is prettier than I had
thought.”

Courses here have been very
different for Kempster. ‘‘We
don’t have exams until after our
4 years at the university.”” She
notes that at Reading she
attends large lectures and does
not meet with her professors. ‘‘I
hand in papers maybe once a
fortnight. Apart from commen-
tary, the essays do not receive
marks.’’ Although she has
found the American classroom
experience interesting and
taking exams useful, she prefers
her university’s system. ‘I like
being my own boss and doing
Self-
discipline is better.’

Kempster speaks with admir-
ation and respect fig ene Amer-
ican friends. She Ropes that
they recognize their good for-
tune, but comments, ‘‘People
here have so much. Although
people in Europe have a high
standard of living, we don’t

waste as much.”

She is also concerned about
the apparently casual attitude
Americans have toward vio-
lence. “It appalls me that so
many Americans seem to laugh
at violence. In England, we
wouldn’t laugh.’’ Kempster
notes that American television
seems to foster this attitude and
“places as much emphasis on
violence as British television
places on sex.”

Masooma Habib, the Paki-
stani international student, ‘re-
ceived her B.A. from Kinneird
College. She had met Econom-

.

Patricia Boughaba, Toshimutsu Kamakura, Charu Sharma, and Jose Lozano squint happily in

(Trey Thies)

ics Professor Charles Ratliff and
talked with last year’s inter-
national student, Seema Han-
afi, about Davidson, but was
expecting nothing specific when
she arrived. She has found
Davidson students a friendly
group, but notes that ‘I had to
make an effort as well.”’

Charu Sharma is a graduate
of St. Stephen’s College, New
Delhi, India. After accepting a
position with a tea firm, Shar-
ma received his scholarship
to Davidson.

He knew little about David-
son, and a principle reason for

dull, yet surprising

his coming to the United States
was to spring-board dive. He
was, of course, very disap.
pointed to learn that Davidson
did not have the facilities, but
he has been able to dive some in
Charlotte, and was elected “Ajj.
conference”’ in diving.

Sharma finds Davidson to
have ‘‘a very intellectual atmos.
phere." He believes the college
is ‘‘a lovely place, with lovely
people,” but the academic ori-
entation handicaps foreigners in
their effort to meet students.
Sharma plans to work in a
summer camp this summer
before returning to India,

All of the foreign students are
especially vocal about the Da-
vidson Honor Code. Although
they appreciate its ideology,
they view it as a system that is
not practical in the ‘‘real’’
world. They are particularly
offended by the idea of pledging

_to report on a violating friend

They agree that if a student
wishes to cheat or steal, he is
hurting himself, but others
should not be required or asked
to report him.

Lochel believes that the
pledge is almost Fascist in
nature. ‘‘I’m surprised that you
have to agree to turn in friends.
This destroys human relation-
ships. Is it more important to
be faithful to your friends or an
institution?”’ Moy agrees: ‘In
every society people have to
decide what to do on their own.
We don’t have the right to play
God.”

The international students
also believe that an all inter-
national off-campus house
might be a practical idea.
Although some feel that in
America, they should live a-
mong Americans, most feel that
this may help relations between
all students. At Davidson, they
have run into some problems on
the international halls. Because
their schedules are not as heavy
as that of the average student,
their leisure hours sometimes
conflict with the study habits of
other students. In general,
however, their days at David-
son have been a good education,
though frequently not in the
academic sense.
