FINAL AS TO CHAMPIONSHIP

With the defeat of the Wildeats by the
Wake lads Saturday there is appar-
ently an open road for Carolina to the state
championship. Se Carolina unde-
feated by a Tar Heel aggregation, and the
only chance remaining that Davidson
will come out victor in’ their contest at
Chapel Hill on Saturday, November 17.
Carolina sent State home with a defeat of
14 to 0 & week ago today, and if the Wild-
eats can triumph over State and Carolina,
Trinity ought to be victim of defeat.

Furman beat the Citadel Bulldogs by a good
margin, 30 to 14.) Along with the splendid
record already made by this eleven, the above
fact foretells a defeat if comparative scores
talk. But it is unsafe to bank on this, and
the Wildcats will fight to a finish to return
home The game following
soon after the battle with Wake Forest will)
be an item against the Wildcats.

State put up a good right against Caro-
lina last Thursday, but the latter proved too
much and came out on the upper end, 14 to 0.
The State fought harder
against, Carolina than they will against any
other squad, but it availed them nothing. It
still maintained that Davidson and
State are not far apart in their comparative
scores, and the contest in Charlotte is going
to be a scrap worth witnessing.

Clemson was idle during the past week.
At least, no scores could be found indicat-
ing whom she played. The Tigers have been
setting a fast pace, and when the Wildcats
make their second journey to the Sandlapper
