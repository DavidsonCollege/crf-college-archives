On Drug Enforcement

Although THE DAVIDSONIAN published the
Student Life Committee’s SLC suggestions on the
revision of the official college attitudes toward drug
law enforcement before they were officially released,
it seems a shame that such prolonged secrecy was
felt necessary by officials on the SLC.

If anything, the changes would create a much
more realistic and much healthier official climate
concerning the widespread phenomenon of campus
drug use.

Certainly Davidson should not put itself in the

ition of condoning the use of illegal drugs un-
til the attitudes of society change currently unreason-
able drug laws. Davidson..cannot, however, take up-
on itself the position of enforcing existing drug laws.
The evidence and reasoning of the SLC concerning
this matter. are quite sound and should be accepted.

As to the attitude which the college should take
toward drug users it seems that here also the SLC
is on quite sound principles.when it suggests that
a system of counseling would be more valuable than
a.system of punishment. _

What we need is not a community of narcs but
a community of understanding and responsible free-
dom.

Dorms On The Move

Spurred by the recent discussions on Davidson’s
fraternity system, debate on social institutions at
this campus has begun to touch events once accept-
ed as facts of life beyond question. :

' We wholly endorse the suggestion to end the
practice of moving students out of dorms to provide
dates with housing on big weekends.

Politicians, Southern-Style

President Nixon ought to
like the Movement for a New.
Congress (MNC): it definite-
ly involves students in the
system. ~

The system Davidson's
MNC—a _ typical Davidson
turnout of seven plus one
professor on a _ Saturday
morning — got involved in
was rural North Carolina poli-
tics, of the sixth district
variety.

Rural politics is in its own
way as traditional and pro-
tocol-bound as any diploma-
tic function. Saturday was
the opening of the Democra-
tic headquarters in Concord,
an opportunity to bring to-
gether all the faithful and to
present the candidates of the
party from the area; inci-

* dentally it was also a chance

for the seven of 1 listo ‘meet
the candidate’ we will be
working for. ©

On a side table were cook-
ies, Fritos, potato chips. and
other goodies along with a
variety of soft drink I had
never seen before; the
cheesécake that-is so indis-
pensable a part of politics
was provided by the hostess
of the headquarters, on whom
someone had = apparently
painted a knit dress.

A local Negro churchman
provided the invocation, or
rather demand for God’s help
in assuring the victory of

In spite of student cries that “nothing is —_ __the“righteous forces, i. e. the

anymore,” facts and i ga for this most nec
sary and worthwhile change.

If spaces are available in the town for dates
and if it is indeed true that often spaces available for
girls are left vacant on big weekends, there seems
“to be no worthwhile reason to inconvenience students
by moving them out of dorms “for their own con-
venience.”

It would be far more valuable to house the dates
elsewhere and to allow students to entertain as they
normally would in their regular dorm rooms.

Allowing students dorm privileges on big
weekends would also end part of the disparity of
opportunity between the’ fraternity member and the
independent. since the latter may depend on and
prefer entertainment in his dorm room to that avail-
able elsewhere for Davidson’s socially underprivileg-
ed. majority. © : ’

Cecil Burney, however, has probably hit the
major question concerning the entire social system
of-the big weekends when he suggests that perhaps
they should be ended completely.

Big weekends are, let’s face it, just too big.
They are tiring, too disruptive of academic life, and
vice more a hindrance than a help to a_relation-
ship.
A more valuable expenditure would be for more
frequent and more regular activities. Such events
would promote the more casual relationship that
could be extended as a matter of choice rather than
necessity.

‘PARANOIA’

hes, OPP

~ Democrats in. their struggle

for good. He meant it, too;
across town in the Republi-
can headquarters there are
no blacks.

“TIT sure am glad to see
all you Democrats ” said
the M.C, and began present-
ing candidates for local
judgeships, high sheriff,
state senator, etc.

Being neither a Democrat
nor a Carolinian, I was get-
ting bored, especially since
a nondescript little guy was

. blocking my” view of the

hostess.

Then that nondescript was
introduced as candidate for
the U.S. Congress and gave

his prepared speech to the:

hopeful. As his campaign
manager Elvin Jackson,
brother of the’ professor who
had accompanied us, William
E. Jackson, had assured us
beforehand, Clifton Blue was
not an especially inspiring
speaker. :

~

Blue -is not precisely the
sort of candidate one envis-
ages the MNC campaigning
for. Not only is he_ not

glamorous, he is _ not
even liberal, except  con-
ceivably by sixth district
standards.

Blue may we a _ pusillani-
mous pussy-footer' on the
war, but he opposes busing
of school children to achieve
racial balance and answer-
ed our question about his
stance on a volunteer army

“by admitting he does not

have one because he does
not known anything about
the question.

But Blue ts, as his cam-
paign manager also assured
us before we met him, an
appealing candidate. For one
thing he was . impressively
‘straightforward in dealing
with us,

He did not make any ef-
fort to present himself as
anything other than what he
was: a candidate with a
rural constituency who is
concerned about Vietnam but
more interested in interest
rates and insurance legisla-
tion.

LETTER

Eee

The effort to elect Cliff
Blue is well worthwhile ‘in
a way which exemplifies the
workings of traditional South-
ern politics.

Blue’s opponent, Earl Ruth,
is a man who has a 100%
rating from the Americans
for Congressional .Action, a
group which rates Congress- .
men on how they voted from
a conservative point of view.

“I’m with the President
when, he’s right and against
him when he’s wrong,” Ruth
told a conservative Wash-
ington newspaper, meaning
he opposes - Nixon’s welfare
plan and the Administration’s
enforcement ‘of civil rights -
legislation. .

Blue furthermore _explain-
ed. that integration was the
law of the land and_ that
therefore he supported it.
Blue is 59 years old and was
a_ rural publisher before be-
ing elected to the North Car-
olina Legislature; integra.
tion does not fit with his
background, but he does not
try to block off the recogni-
tion that it is right.

Let Fraternities

Perish Quietly

To The Editor:

In a recent issue of THE
DAVIDSONIAN, it was stat-
ed that only 475 or so peo-
ple were still in fraternities.

If Davidson has only 1,000
persons enrolled, and there
are 250 freshmen, then ap-
proximately 63% of eligible
students are in fraternities.

The article also stated that
last. year, about 100 people
went inactive. How many of
these came during the Sig-
ma —Chi controversy? Se-
veral, I'm sure.

(Many of them were pos-
sibly seniors, who went in-
active in the last few
months of school to avoid
having to pay a bilil.

According to THE DA-
VIDSONIAN, about 21 or so
persons have gone inactive
this year. Could it be. that
most of these were people

who have just come back
from the Junior Year
Abroad program?

The year abroad -tends to
interest people in other
things than fraternities. Ap-
parently, many have drop-
ped out in the past after
coming back.

Last year it was my un-
derstanding that’ there was
a provision whereby if a
fraternity had less’ than 30
members for 3 years, it for-
feited its house.

Any house in which this
occurred could be turned in-
to an eating club, or what-
ever. This seems like a pro-
vision for letting the frater-
nities die.

If they are dying, as peo-
ple say, why not_let—them
die naturally?
