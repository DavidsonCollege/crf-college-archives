“Vision”: Main Topic
At Vesper Service

Richardson Stresses “Youth” and
“Volunteer” in Talk

“An old-time Vision and Volunteer”
was the subject upon which Dr. D. \W
| Richardson, to
| China and now occupying the chair of
Missions at Union Theological Sem
Richmond, addressed the
Davidson Y. M. C. A. Sunday evening in
Shearer Hall.

The Seriptural for the talk,
|found in Isaiah 6:1-8, gives a deserip-
tion of Isaiah's vision in the temple
and of his response. It was the de
ciding factor coming at a crisis in the
young man’s life when he was unde-
| cided as to his life work.

important element in the
vision that saw God.
| This vision of God gave him a new

h's was he
jand right start in life; it impressed up-
on him God's greatness and_ purity.
Moreover, he felt that now was the
time for a fresh start in obedience to
this heavenly vision, that if he follow-
ed the old way of living after this ex-
perience, he was guilty of sacrilege.

What was equally important, the
young prophet gained a new vision of
himself. His own imperfections were
thrown into sharp relief when exposed
to the blinding radiance of God's purity
and holiness. This new standard of
comparison removed the smug satisfac-
tion that was his when comparing him-
self with his fellowmen.

Then there was the vision of cleans-
ing, needed in any change of life. The
angel took the coal from the altar and
touched his lips as a symbol of for-
giveness. Jesus Christ, in like man-
ner, has cleansed our lives and deliver-
ed us from the power of sin through
his death on the cross.

Finally, there was a new vision of
power that took the place of the old
feeling of incapacity and insufficiency.
Like Paul, he could then say, “I can
do all things through Christ that
strengtheneth me.” One fully conse-
crated soul along with Christ’s power
has unlimited potentialities. We must
not proceed in our own strength, but
must look to Him and then do things
with and for Him.

CHANGES MADE IN
CLASS SCHEDULES

Some very’ decided changes have
been made in the schedule for next
year.

Breakfast hour will be five minutes
earlier, On Monday the schedule will
be the same as this year with the ex-
ception that the recitation periods will
start ten minutes earlier. For the oth-

er days of the week chapel has been

changed from 10:15 to 10:40 thus
breaking the four morning periods so
that no student will have more than
two straight recitation periods. This,
together with the changing of the din-
ner hour to 12:30, are

most important changes.

the seventh periods on Mondays, Wed-
nesdays, and Fridays.
periods will end at 3:05
Tuesdays and Thursdays. Thus with
the exception of drills most of the
students will get off their classes an
hour earlier than they do this year,
as there willbe e@nly a few lecture
courses in the sixth period. bd
It is not yet determined whether the
new schedule is a success. Its success
is based upon the approval of the stu-
dents, and their ability to take any
course desired without a conflict. So
far the students have been able to
