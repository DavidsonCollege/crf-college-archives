team has just returned from a weekend road trip which saw
them lose all four of their games.

Can Charlotte Support
Football Franchise?

By PETE CELENTANO
Staff Writer

Time and time again Charlotte has proved that it
is not a “‘big-league”’ town. Take the case of the
Cougars. Here is a championship basketball team
which cannot draw consistently well in Charlotte or
any other city in this supposedly ‘‘basketball-
crazy”’ state.

An additional factor is the population of this area.
Charlotte is a rather small (by professional stan-
dards) area from which to draw good crowds (ap-
proximately 400,000 people within a 20-mile radius)
and this is not the hotbed of football that com-
parably-sized cities such as Tampa, Fla. and Bir-
mingham, Alabama are.

Another factor is the chance of the team failing at
the gate. It has been estimated that a WF L team
would have to average 40,000 per game in order to
break even. If the team does poorly and with the
competition from high school, college and televised
NFL games, it is doubtful that this break-even point.
will be approached.

The cost of building a stadium would also be
prohibitive. Memorial Stadium is inadequate both
in seating capacity and parking facilities. Building
a new stadium or enlarging the present stadium
would involve an enormous cash outlay.

Finally, consider the people of Charlotte. There
is a large proportion of transients who could not or
would not support a local professional team.
Charlotteans have been consistently apathetic
about professional sports in general and there
would be no reason for them to change now.

Charlotte, in short, is not ready for a professional
franchise in football or any other sport. Perhaps it

never will be. _
On the local scene, the expressed ‘‘de-emphasis

of football at Davidson does not seem to have
helped any of the “‘minor’”’ sports here. There has
not been any expression of increased financial sup-
port for baseball, soccer, tennis, swimming, rifle,
etc. Why not spend some time re-evaluating the en-
tire sports philosophy at Davidson?

There is no reason why Davidson should not
broaden its athletic horizons. Fencing, lacrosse,
bowling, ice hockey, water polo, field hockey and
team handball might be considered as possible in-
tercollegiate sports.

Davidson has for too long revolved on the
traditional football-basketball axis in in-
tercollegiate athletics. Adding such diverse sports
as those mentioned above would involve many

Four Games On Road Trip

By MARK WILENSKY
Sports Editor

After picking up a 14-0 vic-
tory over Franklin and Mar-
Shall one week ago, David-
son’s baseball team embarked
upon a weekend roadtrip with
newly found confidence. They
returned with four straight
defeats.

inst Franklin and Mar-

freshman Tim Peck,
though wild, threw a strong
two hitter. The Cats played a
perfect game in the field and
hit with authority.

Mitch Stone continued his
fine hitting with two singles
and Mark Rodgman broke
loose with a double and a
homer. Cleanup hitter George
Weicker banged four hits in-
cluding a home run. Ed
Willingham also began to hit
in this game.

Joel Tew opened up the road
trip at East Carolina Satur-
day. Tew give up only three
singles, bu East Carolina
grouped two o; them around a
walk on error by shortstop
Gary Pomeroy to score two
unearned runs in the fifth.
slammed the door
thereafter, but the damage
was already done.

The Wildcats outhit the
Pirates 5-3, but scored only
when Bill Todd’s single drove
Weicker home in the fourth.
Dave Mayberry singled and
was sacrificed to second in the
fifth, but Stone and Dave
Ingold flew out, ending the
threat.

In the second game, Ross
Manire, who pitched so well
against VMI, got shelled as
East Carolina triumphed 12-0.
Manire was in trouble from
the start as East Carolina hit

everything the stylish left-

hander threw up.

Cat bats were silent once
again as Davidson managed
only four scattered singles.
The Wildcats never
threatened in the game. No
Davidson runner reached
second base.

After the two losses at
Greenville, the team moved
to Williamsburg, Va. to
tangle with William and Mary.
The change of scenery did the
sick Cat bats little good.

Dwight Plemmons started
against the Indians in the
opener. Plemmons was ex-
tremely sharp and permitted
six hits and two runs (one
unearned). Once again, good
pitching went for naught.

Davidson scored once in the
top of the seventh on

Weicker’s single, a passed ball

and another sage Rcd de-
hitter ichols.
Tetouan and Dave Ingold
had the two other Cat hits,
Ingold’s a double.

Freshman Jim Barr made
his initial start in the second
game for Davidson and was
rudely greeted. Three runs
and four Indian hits knocked
him out in the second. Frank
Folger came on with the bases
full and nobody out and stifled
the threat. Folger finished the
game, yeidling only two hits in
the five full innings he worked.

While collecting six singles
and Gary Pomeroy’s triple,
the Cats could manage only
one run. Mitch Stone drove
Pomeroy in with a single
following the shortstop’s triple
in the second.
