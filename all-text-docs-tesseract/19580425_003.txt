All That

By JIM HAMILTON

Aspiring athletes can learn a lot from Ray Antley,
Davidson's two miler.

Antley is not a great athlete. His stocky build is
not the kind traditionally associated with distance run-
ners. His choppy stride is no picture of grace.

Neverless, Antley is a man to be copied.

For Antley has two essential qualities, desire
and determination. Ray wants to be a track man and
is willing to work for his goal. In all kinds of weath-
er, you can see Ray out on the track, always work-
ing harder than anyone else on the team. It’s paid
off. Ray has broken the tape twice this year for first
place. :

OUR BOY, CY

One of the most amusing conversations P’ve had in
a long time was with actor Cy Tripplett, curley-headed
star of the Davidson story.

In this thrilling drama, Cy, a typical Davidson
gentleman, is supposed to be the star of the tennis
team. However, a little probing forced Cy to admit
that he had never played a game of tennis in his life.

Despite this little triviality, likable Cy, who was to
be filmed in a close-up action shot, was not primarily
concerned with learning to hit the ball. Instead he asked
whether the team played in long sleeves or not.

_ When I informed him that they didn’t, he moaned
“Oh. the tattoo on my arm will show.”

They let Cy have his picture taken in a warm-up
jacket.

ODE TO A U. N. C. FOOTBALL PLAYER

It’s not if you won,

Or if you slipped.

Just if you played well enough
To keep your scholarship.

QUESTIONS OF THE WEEK ‘

Why aren't the tennis courts in better shape this
late in the season?

Why doesn’t the Charlotte Observer give Davidson
spring sports a better coverage? (Not a picture of a Da-
vidson athlete this spring.)

SHELBOURNE WALLACE, captain of the Davidson nine,
is pictured pulling in a fly ball deep in centerfield.

Wallace Leads Nine
From Centerfield

By “B” MILLNER
Leading Davidson’s horsehiders into conference title
bly not be able to make the/contention is Captain Shelbourne Wallace, a four-year vet-

Kingsport, sity letter as a freshman, in
Tennessee, earned his first var-| spite of being sidelined with an

injury for much of the season.
Since then he has played con-
‘sistently fine baseball, having
accumulated a “lifetime” bat-
ting average well above 300.
The stocky centerfielder

is currently hitting in the
number three slot and slug-
ging the ball at a .317 pace.
The team’s second leading
hitter, he has accounted for
fifteen runs, batting in nine
and scoring six on thirteen
hits. Four of his hits have
been for extra bases.

Coach Tom Stevens praises
Wallace’s base running ability.
“He is exceptionally fast on the
bases and only his position in
the batting order (just before
the clean-up hitter) has kept
him from stealing more bases
for us.”

HIGH SCHOOL STAR

In high school in Kingsport,
Tennessee, Wallace played base-
ball, track, and football, making
all-conference in the latter.

Shelbourne is a brother of
Kappa Alpha social fraternity,
which he has served as vice-
president this year. An ROTC
Lt. Colonel, he is 2 member of
Scabbard and Blade, also being
a Distinguished Military Stu-
dent and commander of the first
battalion. Wallace, a business-
major, has served as’ secretary
of the Business-Economics As-
sociation.

Coach Stevens stated that
Wallace has been outstanding
as captain of the Wildcats. In
baseball where most decisions
are left to the coach, the team
captain has the responsibility of
keeping up the team’s hustle
and morale.

The Wildcats are now hold-

ing down the number two spot| .

in Southern Conference stand-
ings.

ma Chis are in second. The
round robin tournament has
now gotten into full swing aft-
ter the delay caused by the
weather, although there are
still several games to be played
that were missed.

PHI GAMS, PIKAS LEAD

With recotds of. 4 wins and
no losses, the Phi Gams and Pi-
kas are setting the pace in the
competition while the Sigma
Chis are cldse behind them with

ja record of 3 wins and no
losses.

In third place, the K.A.s have
won 3 and Jost 1 while the Betas
with 2 wins and 2 losses and
the Phi Delts and S.A.E.s with
1 win and 1 loss apiece are
tied for fourth place.

In fifth place, the S.P.E.s

have won 2 and fost 3 while

' the Independents and

A.T.0.s are tied for sixth

place with 1 win — 3
losses apiece.

;siderably. Cdéach Tom Stevens
commented at the first of the
year that he was expecting to
have a good hitting team, but
was doubtful as to the strength
of his pitching staff.

However. both Dave Page
with a 3-0 record and Allen
Moore who has an excellent 1.11
earned run average have held
opponents well in check so far
this season.

Coach Stevens has also been
pleased with the work of his
infield and especially that of
Don Killian at shortstop. Kil-
lian, batting .333, and Shel-_
bourne Wallace at 317. have
been the only big boys at the
plate as yet.
