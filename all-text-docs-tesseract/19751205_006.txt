ween light and the sur-
rounding environment, but by
doing so nullifies the distinc-
tive feature of neon art.

Only through a medium
such as neon light can the
artist work with light in its
purest form. As Mr. Noe
himself pointed out in his
gallery talk, light has always
had the ability to mesmerize
the viewer, but until recently
the only light in a piece of art
was reflected light.

Neon works generate their
own light and to combine them
as Noe does with rope, sand
and sticks detracts from their
impact.

Furthermore, the artist
makes no effort to hide the
wires and transformers needed
to charge the tubes which
further detracts from the
show.

The poor effect is not en-
tirely Mr. Noe’s fault though.
Stowe gallery is simply too
small to display the five
works. Rather than allowing
each piece to have darkness
around it--providing a power-
ful contrast--the light from
each impinges on the domain
of every other work.

The best way to study the
show would be to close the
door to the gallery and turn on
just one piece at a time.

Mr. Noe’s visit and lecture,
however, were enjoyable and
quite rewarding primarily be-
cause most of the slides shown
in the presentation were of
works by other sculptors.

Some excellent work has
been done by other neon
artists and. the medium has
proven its unique contribution
to art. :

Mr. Noe’s show should be
visited simply because it is the
only thing like it on campus,
and with some imagination
one can visualize the full
power of neon art.
