In the second halt the Wolf
pack broke through with two
touchdowns in both the third
and fourth quarters They got
three of them on the ground and
the other through the air

“They didnt run over us,
said playing coach Carl Rizzo
“They simply exhausted us. We
had almost everyone on the line
going both ways. We really
played our hearts out.”

The Davidson defense felt the
loss of defensive coordinator
Bob Wetzel who could not at
tend the game. This multiplied
Rizzo's problems with the line

Davidson continually had
trouble with their off-tackle
power plays and passing

Nevertheless _they cid move the

bau and connected on several
third and Jong situauons, 4!
cording to Rizzo

Offensive standouts for the
Wildcats included Allan
Willams. Bill Du Pont. and Len
Gillespie The defense was
sparked by Eric Scharhng, Jun
Claunch) David MeWalliams
and Bruce Reiehelderter

The club football team has

been bothered by a lack of depth

Tom Scott. the son ot the
athletic director. joined the

“We have been plagued this
season by a lack of depth.

which could help the team
