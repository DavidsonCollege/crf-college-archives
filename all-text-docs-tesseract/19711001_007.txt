GBARI EXCITING
Soccer star Seraphin Gbari fires at the goal.

“Wha: else can you say about
a team that has scored 16 goals
in its first two games?” he
asked.

The ‘Cats have indeed racked
up 16 goals in their first two
games of the season, downing
Methodist College 8-1 here and
defeating N. C. Wesleyan 8-0 in
Favetteville.

The team scoring has been
fairly equally divided. but ex-
change student Seraphin Gbari
has performed extremely well,
scoring three times against
Methodist and once against Wes-
fevan: .

“Gbari played an amazing
game against Methodist,’ Le-
van said. ‘“‘He would get the

ball at midfield and take it
down to score unassisted.”

Two freshmen also put in
good showings. Joe Duncan
-scored against Wesleyan and
Jack Linard claimed two goals
at Rocky Mount.

Joe Yochem, Bill Vaughn
and Johnny Robison all scored
in the Methodist game, and
Brian Tarr added two goals.

Alex Coblentz, Dick Spinner,
Tim Winter and Johnny Robi-
son scored in the Wesleyan
game.

Today the Wildcats travel to
The Citadel to face their first
Southern Conference game.
There is some apprehension
about the game being called

due to bad weather.

Tuesday the booters will host
Western Carolina here at David-
son.

“This game will be our first’ -
real test,” Levan said. ‘“West-—
ern Carolina has a fine team,
the first strong team we will
face.”

Western Carolina has been
highly ranked during the early
season.

Levan also commented on the
size of the crowd attending the
Methodist game.

“There were as many people
as last year’s championship
game,” he said ‘‘and they real-
ly enjoyed the show.”

Coeds Enter Sports World
In The Role Of Participants

By JENNET ROBINSON and
MARIE FERRARA

As co-ed managers of the soc-
cer team. we have been exposed
to a completely new aspect of
the sports world for us, that of
being more of a participant
than a spectator.

We make no claims to having
mastered our soccer managing
jobs, for our duties are not that
regulated. Actually we are two
g.rl Fridays.

Wildeats Lose To Indians,
Face Mounties In Charlotte -

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

William and Mary and Ap-
palachian State University are
fairly certain of their finish in
the Southern Conference foot-
ball race.

The Indians appear to be roll-
ing toward a_ repeat of last
year’s championship, as_ their
40-14 defeat of the Wildcats was
their third conference victory
without a loss.

Appalachian. on the other
hand, is the newest member of
the conference and plays only
two games against member
schools. These games do not
count in the conference stand-
ings.

The Wildcats furnish the op-
position for the Mountaineers
tomorrow at 2 p.m. at the Char-
lotte Memorial Stadium. The
game will mark the first meet-
ing between the two schools in
football.

The Mountaineers carry a 1-
1-1 worksheet into the contest.
In their opening game, a score-
less tie with conference foe
Furman, the Apps defense was
firm. but an erratic offense
could not produce any points.

The following week the Apps
squeezed out a 28-24 victory
over East Tennessee State. Last
week, however, arch-rival West-
ern Carolina blanked the Moun-
ties 26-0.

Coach. Jim Brakefield, in his
first season at Appalachian aft-
ter building a powerhouse at
Wofford, has installed the famed
‘Wishbone Y” offense. In the
“Y" the tackles split out fur-

ther than usua! and the iwo
halfbacks and the fullback form
a triangle behind the quarter-
back.

Wildca: assistant coach Aiex
Gettys described defending
against the Wishbone as ‘‘play-
ing a giant chess game and try-
ing to outguess your opponent.”

Gettys noted that the Wish-
bone enables the offense to em-
ploy at leas: three backs to
one side of the line at any
time. He also pointed out that
the many possible formations
place an added burden on the
defensive end. middle lineback-
er and secondary.

The Mounties are blessed with
a versatile senior halfback.
Clayton Deskins. A wide receiv-
er last year. Deskins is at tail-
back now and has gained 312
yards rushing in three games.

Injuries have dented the
Mountie backfield corps. Full-
back Ned Mullen broke his col-
larbone against East Tennessee.
while Pat Gainer suffered a
severe ankle sprain against
Western Carolina and will not
see action tomorrow.

Other backs to--watch are.

fullback Tim Cokely and quar-
terbacks Steve Loflin and Ray
Haskett. Neither Loflin nor Has-
kett is a feared runner, but

Haskett has a strong passing ©

arm.

Loflin will start the game,
and Gettys is expecting the
Apps to open their atiack more
against the ‘Cals.

Defensively the Mounties have
an; imposing line, good line-
backers and a questionable sec-

ondary.

Eddie Biggs and Steve Chap-
man hold down the defensive
end slots. Wayne Fletcher has
been a two-time all-district tac-
kle. and he will be complement-
ed by either Ron Reynolds or
Anthony Dale.

Roger Richardson, the only
returning letterman in the sec-
ondary. underwent an appendec-
tomy prior to the season and
his playing status is uncertain.

Seniors Roger Hinsaw and
Wes Beam mix with sophomores
Doug Humble, Ricky Spencer
and Frank Wey as deep backs.

Despite the defeat by William
and Mary, Gettsy explained that
the loss was not as bad as the
score indicated.. ‘‘They made
three great catches on us to
set up scores, and if they keep
on doing that they'll beat a lot
of people,’’ he noted.

Defensive end Jimmy Hardi-
son was sorely missed against
the Indians. as their backs con-
stantly gained vardage off-tac-
kle and around end. Hardison
is expected to play tomorrow.

A bright spot in the loss was
the passing of quarterback Rick
Kemmerlin, who came off the
bench near the end of the first
half and played the remainder
of the game. His continued im-
provement could cause prob-
lems for the Apps secondary.

The stage is set for a real
struggle tomorrow, as the Moun-
ties will be trying to prove that
they belong in the conference,
and the Wildcats will be fight-
ing to gain their long-awaited
first victory.

’

Our routine is hardly boring.
for you will find our duties a
regular menage of activities:
treating blisters and muscle
cramps. filling water buckets
(and carrying them up and
down that hill), handing out salt
and dextrose tables, making and
distributing posters, and keep-
ing up that bright smile (this
helps the morale during 95 de-
gree practice weather).

As modern day combinations
of Clara Barton and Charles
Atlas, we do manage to have
fun. Well, maybe not so much
fun as certain eye opening. ex-
periences. Such as being seat-
ed inside the goal in order to
insure more accurate aim dur-
ing practice goaling. It’s strange
how one can put all of one’s
confidence as well as life in
the hands of a (hopefully agile)
goalie.

Our executive manager, Ken-

ny Jones, tends to keep us on
our toes. however. and particul-
arly when we begin to lag by
emptying a full water bucket
over one of our unassuming
heads.

Our fearless leader will go to
any extremes to keep his un-
derlings in line.

From the looks of practice
and Saturday's victory over
Methodist. the team appears
more than ready for an excit-
ing season.

The ‘Cats face twelve rough
teams this year: Methodist, N.
C. Wesleyan, The Citadel, West-
ern Carolina, Furman, Duke.
Pfeiffer, Belmont Abbey, Guil-
ford. St. Andrews, East Caro-
lina, and N. C. State.

We are particularly awaiting
our game with The Citadel in
Charleston today. because we
both get to go home.

Freshman Squad
Opens With Evans

The Davidson Wildkittens will
open their season tomorrow
night with a game against Evans
College at 8 p.m. at A. C. Brown
High School in Kannapolis.

The freshmen have fielded a
large team with almost fifty
players on the roster.

Tom Stevens has taken over
as coach of the team, replacing
Gene McEver.

Stephens is receiving coach-
ing assistance from four in-
jured varsity players.

Billy Colvin will serve as of-
fensive line coach, and Sandy
Carnegie will work with the de-
fensive line.

Mike Kelly is aiding Stevens
as offensive back coach and
Jeff Lynn is working with the
defensive backs.

“We have no real idea of
how good we are,” Stevens
said. ‘‘We haven't had as much
time as we would like, but I
think we're ready.” ~

“It’s hard to get much time
to really .work on the things
that the team needs,” he added.
‘since we help the varsity most
of the week.

Stevens said that he had little
knowledge of the Evans team.

“Our biggest trouble at the
moment is in linebackers.” he
said. “‘We don't have enough
depth in that position.”

The backfield for the ‘Kittens
will be of fairly good size, with
6 feet David Harper at quarter-
back, 6-1 Dave Sharenko at
slotback, 6-1 Foney Mullins at
half, and 3-11 Steve Still at half.

“We will us primarily a Dav-
idson style of attack, Stevens
said, ‘‘so that the freshnien can
become acquainted with the
varsity’s offense.

The next freshman game will
be Oct. 9 at Furman Univer-
sity.
