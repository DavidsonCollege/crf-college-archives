F. H. Lindley won from R. McLeod. |
Bill Murray won from G. D. Rogers. |
Currie won from Soc Gibbs.

W. B. Mattison won from Bowie.
Buster Lawson won from Morrow.
W. E. Milton won from A. B. Claytor.
Thomas won from Ed Brown.

The first quarter of the sixty-odd men en- |
tered gives an even chance to each man in|
the group; Vic Brown and Wood Brown, |
though, will more than likely fight it out in|
the fourth round.

Bill Muray is the class of his section, but |
the lanky racqueter will find his drive to the |
championship obstructed by several hazards. |
Bill, who now holds the alternate place on |
the Varsity, should not fail to come through |
to the finals.

ON THE MAGNETISM OF
JESUS

Dr. J. M. Vander Meulen, president of
Louisville Theological and
among the most popular of all ministers
with Davidson men was the speaker at
the morning church last Sun-}
day. His® powerful) sermon, with John
12:32 as a text, never lacked the closest
attention.

The Magnetism of Jesus was his subject.
The dramatically showed the
magnetic drawing the Sav-
iour and his universal appeal to which
not even his enemies are immune. Renan
and Strauss, great atheists of the roth
century are foreed to render unwilling
homage to His power.

“Tesus draws by his flawless person |
ality. Strike Jesus from Christinity and)
no religion. God Himself
the “greatest of personalities. Without |
personality He would not be God,

“Jesus is the one founder of a great
religion whose appeal is without limita. |
tion, With facility He |

He never fails the call of the more he-|
nighted. Wealth acclaim |
Him a common Lord. Jesus is the one|
incomparable Founder. |

“The secret of the power of Jesus is
that He stands in the gaps which other:
wise ruin our souls. His forgiving love
is the keystone of Jesus’ personality— |
that love whose vastness is beyond ie
