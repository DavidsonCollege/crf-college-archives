Civilisation’ Sutton Offers

History Of Western Man

By DOUG BROWN

Asst. Managing Editor

Civilisation’, Sir Kenneth
Clark's masterful series of
thirteen 52 minute color
films, is being used as the
basis for the Extended Stud-
ies project in Area V. This
series is Clark's personal in-
terpretation of the last six-
teen hundred years in the his-
tory of the Western world.

Area V is the inter-area of
the Extended Studies projects
and it is open to freshmen
and sophomores. The book
“Civilisation,’’ which is the
script .of the films, is read
along with viewing the film
and participating in discus-
sion groups.

According to Assistant Pro-
fessor of German Dr. Hans-

—~Arthur— Gregor ford Epes Jr., ‘Clark sees

Charlie Byrd | Quartet

To Give Concert In Love

By DOUG ‘BROWN’
Asst. Managing Editor

Charlie ‘Byrd and his quar-
tet will appear in Love Audi-
torium at 8:00 p.m. on Satur-
day, April 3.. Byrd has ap-
peared in concert tours for
more than a decade, and his
repertoire is extreme-
ly varied.

Duff Bruce, Social Chair-
man, said. “I have seen him
play classical, pop, and back
into the Beatles.’’ Byrd en-
compasses all types of music,
and he has performed at such
places as Carnegie Hall and
the ‘London Philharmonic.

‘Byrd has not previously
appeared: at Davidson, -and
Bruce commented, ‘‘We are
fortunate to have him come
to Davidson at this time, He
i really a top flight. per-

ry

former, and d was very im--

pressed when I heard him.”

In recent years Byrd has
put emphasis on contempo-
rary. material, and his latest

Senate

the right to "choose the sy-
stem. they want. By deny-
ing that right, we would be
making a drastic mistake.”

The proposal passed by a
‘vote of 11-6, including two
absentee votes in favor and
one abstention.

Burney then proposed that
the Senate endorse the idea
that ‘they ‘ask the trustees to
hear. opposing voices to the
proposal. This motion pass-
ed 10-5.

Turner then added a rider
to the bill which would give
the student government con-
trol ‘of the rush program, a
concept which was, not men-
tioned in the original propos-
al. |

However, a. motion to re-
consider thé “bill with the
rider was defeated 8-6.

Clodfelter stated that

albums eles this. Byrd has
a special fondness for jazz,
and he has been greatly in-
fluenced by the Beatles and
Milés Davis.

“Byrd is so versatile that
he is reminiscent of Roger
Williams on the piano,"’ said
Bruce. What is distinctive
about Charlie Byrd is his
ability to blend several dif-
ferent forms and his original
treatment of material. ‘His
combination of styles is quite

remarkable,”’ said Bruce.

Also appearing this week-
end will be ‘The Great
Speckled Band.” This is a
country-rock group which will
be giving two blanket con-
certs in the Morrison Room
tonight and Saturday at
10:30. Howard Ramagli, who
heads the Hungry d, feels,
“The group is very similiar
ot the ‘Nitty Gritty Dirt
Band’, and it is extremely
original.”

Western tradition can be well
seen through art, although he

coes sce limitations to this
interpretation.
“No man in 650 minutes

can tell the story of Western
civilization and have all
agree with him. Clark ap-
pears to have a g rudge
against the twentieth cen-
tury,’” commented Epes.

As a discussion group lead
er, Epes has a great interest
in ‘‘Civilisation’’, and he finds
it to be the best film presen
tation of art. “This is an ex-
cellent exposure to good art,
and I am very pleased that
57 students are viewing the
film and reading the book
‘Civilisation’ as an Extended
Studies project.”

‘Another discussion group
leader, Professor of Econom-
ics Dr. Ernest F. Patterson,
is pleased with the high qual-
ity of the photography. ‘‘The
script is well coordinated
with the film, and it is a
highly professional film pres-
entation,’’ he said.

“Unfortunately Clark does
not properly emphasize the
role of economics and tech-
nology in the history of West-
ern man,’’ commented Pat-
terson. ‘Clark tries to do too
much by making art and ar-
chitecture the major reflec
tion of civilization. This is
its strength but also its
weakness,"’ he added.

‘It is fortunate that the
film is aimed at the general
audience and not at the ex-
pert,’’ said Patterson. By
Clark's not considering East-
ern civilisation, Patterson
believes Clark arrogantly im-
plies that civilization is nec

‘that

essarily Western.

“Clark enforces the idea
Western civilization is
the best. This may be true
but I am.not willing to ac-
cept this concept at the pres-
ent time,’ said Patterson.

“ ‘Civilisation’ combines
music, photography of . art,
and ‘Clark's personal inter-
preation,’’ said Professor of
Religion Dr. Max E. Polley.
Polley is only slightly criti-
cal because it excludes
Greek, Roman, and Eastern
civilizations. ‘Clark explains
the meaning of civilization,
and makes one wonder if we
are civilized people today,”
he said.

Polley finds the film and
book somewhat. difficult for
students to, discuss because
the mass of information is
overwhelming. Polley’s reac-
tion to ‘Civilization’ is ex-.
tremely favorable, but he
does sce danger in that one
could accept passively
Clark's personal view of civ-
ilization since Clark is a spe-
cialist in Western art,

Polley finds Clark has a-
sensibility for the material
being covered, and he: is
modest in his approach. Pol-
ley says ‘Clark attempts to
make a synthesis rather than
an analysis of Western tra-
dition. He gives one a sense .
of the general movement of
Western society.”

The National Foundation
for the Humanities is bearing
the cost of ‘*Civilisation,”’ be-
ing shown in this country at
small liberal arts colleges
such as Davidson. The charge
to Davidson is nominal.
