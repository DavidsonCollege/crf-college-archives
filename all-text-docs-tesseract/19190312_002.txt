SHOW YOUR SPIRIT,

Junior Speaking, the stepping stone
between Christmas and Commencement,
has come and gone, It has lifted a bur-
den off many a heart, and has left many
another enslaved. No two men look
back upon it with exactly the same feel-
ings, and now as it is a thing of the past,
memories of it will remain in the minds
of only a few. As we look forward over
the remaining two months of warm,
lazy, spring weather, we have a natural
tendency to lie back and enjoy the pleas-
ant sensation of drifting along un-
troubled by exertion.

Yet during the rest of the term there
are many activities that call for work
and pep on the part of everyone.  Base-
ball, Tennis, Track, Speaking, Drill.
Classes, and others—all demand the in-
terest and support of the student body.
To have a. successful spring, they must
all be participated in and supported with
top-notch interest. ‘The campus — will
need life and pep, and it will be up to
every man to furnish his share. It has
been .said that the man who hasn’t a
vital interest in every recognized campus
activity has no business on that campus.
Is what you do a proof that you are
trying to boost. Davidson in every way?
If not, why not?

Why is it that a night letter cannot
be sent from Davidson. or that one is re-
ceived as late as 10 o'clock the next
morning ?

TAKE HEART.

In looking over old Davidsonian files
our eye was entranced by the following
editorial comfort, which no doubt had a
soothing effect on many a troubled heart
on the campus during the dark days fol-
lowing Junior Speaking. It is teo good
to keep. Here it is:

“There is a remedy for everything.
But turn your listless, love-lorn steps
beneath the stately, wise old elms; but.
listen to the soft Southern zephyrs as
they make love to the tender buds above ;
but look at the full orbed splendor of the
moon. Then think that perhaps she, too,
is walking alone. thinking of you, that
this same wind which whispers to you
so softly now has perhaps played “ring

around the roses” with a golden curl or
gently caressed..the tender loveliness of a
peach-blossum cheek, that she, too, is
perhaps louking at the same wise old man
and telling him something that you
would like very much to hear. ‘Think
of these possibilities, my friend, and take
a little comfort unto yourself.”

Surely there's enough talent in’ the
student body to get up a band. We're
one of the very few R. O. T. C. units
that haven’t one. What's the trouble >

MID-TERM REPORTS,

‘This week mid-term reports are being
sent home, Many a younger brother or
sister will chuckle over the “remarks”
and prepare to do some teasing when the
“young man of excellent character and
gentlemanly conduct’ —or otherwise—
shall arrive home. And “The Davidson-
ian wishes the best of luck to every man
in the student body, that his “remarks”
may be of the highest.

But don’t bank any hopes or fears on
this report, as it is nbt put on permanent
record, being only a commendation or
warning, You may get excellent on a
ticket and flunk the term, or poor and
push the nineties, all depending on your
work for the rest of the spring. So
don’t fool yourself into hopelessness or
overconfidence. Whether you fail or
pass the term, still rests with you.

THE FLAGPOLE AND THE FLAG.
During all these beautiful spring days
the slender white flagpole is an inspiring
sight rearing itself against the blue sky,
but it would be far more inspiring were
a flag only floating from its head. “The
flaz—or the remains of the same—is at
present keeping dust off a shelf in’ the
basement of the Library, If it needs
repair, surely the student body will foot
the hill; or if a new flag is needed, it will
see that one is procured, Who has charge
of it? A bare pole adorns the campus in

very much the same way as the tank.

If some enterprising, — self-supporting
college boy would set up an efficient,
reasonable laundry for the student -body,
and make it isidependent of Davidson
colored washerwomen, he would perform
an act of distinguished service to the col-
lege:

INTEREST IX) POLITICS.

The only objection to Davidson's lo-
cation is that it is set apart from the
outer world, so to speak, and were it not
for a wide-awake college and student
body, would have a tendency to stand
still while the world moves on. This is
one of the big dangers that confronts the
college man. He becomes engrossed in
his’ campus life and except for a daily
superficial glance over the headlines of
his home paper, gives little or no inter-
ested thot to state, national or world
affairs. “Phe average student has a
vague understanding of the workings of
politics, and takes very little. interest. in
what his state legislature or the national
congress are doing. We venture to say
that 50 per cent of the student body do
not know how to cast a political ballot.
or how laws are made. Right at this
time when world history is being made
as it has never been made. before there
are quite a few who have neither know!l-
edge of, not interest in, the workings
and outcome of the Peace Conference.

The college is expected to take in the
boy and turn out the man, and the man
who starts in business with a sublime
political ignorance, will find himself
severely handigapped. Therefore a man
should feel in college that he is a unit
in a republic, where, on reaching the age
of 21, he will be equal to any man. An
obligation rests upon him to take a vital
interest in the well-being of his com-
munity, and how can he insure this wel-
fare unless he be familiar with the
means whereby he may bring it about?
The reading room contains best papers

and periodicals of the country, and the
student has the opportunity to utilize
them now as he never will again.

Keep up with the times.

Next Monday morning election of
editor-in-chief and managers of next
year’s Davidsonian will be held.

GLEE CLUB HAS
GOOD TRIP PLANNED

Due to the unusual conditions of af-
fairs after the Christmas holidays, the

work of the Glee Club was greatly
handicapped. However, thru Mr.
Shields’ faithful efforts, new material!

was found and the Club set to work, the
result being a Glee Club well worthy
of the name Davidson. All credit is due
to “Besse” Shields, the director and
manager.

A very interesting program has been
arranged, consisting of chorus, quartets.
solo, mandolin and guitar, and imper-
sonations. Dates have been made with
Queens College, Charlotte; Flora Mac-
donald, at Red Springs. Bennettsville
(pending) for the 12, 13, 14 of this
month. ‘This will be the only trip of
the season, but is one, well worth work-
ing for.

The following men have been chosen
to represent the Glee Club on the trip:
H. B. Brown, T. A. Freeman. A. M.
Inman, R. Vance, H. B. Dendy, S. M.
Filberr, J. J. Love. C. J. Mathews, A.
D. McArn, A. ‘T. Currie, G. D. Sam-
ple, J. W. Phillips, J. E. McQueen, D.
