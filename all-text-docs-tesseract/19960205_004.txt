Students return from French program in Tours, France

For over 30 years, interested
students have participated in
Davidson’s yearlong program of
study in Montpellier, France.

However, this fall 12 students
departed for France as pioneers,
taking part in a completely trans-
formed French study abroad pro-
gram. : .

Six of these participants have
just returned from the program’s
new location in Tours, France.
Now featuring options for fall or
spring semester study, as well as
the traditional yearlong stay, the
program allows for greater sched-
uling flexibility.

Seven participants opted to
study in France for a single semes-
ter while five elected to remain
there throughout the second se-
mester. Only one participant in the

program did not attend Davidson.

Alan Singerman, Professor of
French, acted as Resident Director
of the trip. He travelled with the
students to Paris, where the group
stayed for three weeks.

During this time, students
spent three hours a day in intensive
language instruction and explored
the city, visiting museums and other
historical and cultural attractions.

Travel during the last few
weeks of the program was made
difficult by worker strikes which
paralyzed many industries. There
was Virtually no transportation and
no mail delivery, explains
McGehee. Because many of the
University students went on strike,
some participants in the yearlong
program were unable to attend
classes.

Lulu Srinivasan, an econom-
ics major, took intensive French
language courses at Davidson for

one and a half years before partici-
pating in the program last fall. Of
her semester abroad, she says “the
best part of the Davidson program
was the three weeks in Paris be-
cause I experienced more of French
culture than I ever could on my
own.”

After the initial segment in
Paris the group moved onto Tours,
where students lived with French
families and attended classes in
language, literature, history, art
history, and civiliZation at the
Institut de Touraine,

“T met friends from all over
the world,” says J.C. Carlson,
“which I found to be a unique
aspect of studying at the Institut.”

Despite a full course load,
Molly McGehee wasn’t over-
whelmed by the work.

“The most challenging thing
was that we had to speak French 24
hours a day,” she says.

DJ choice constitutes much of what
is broadcast. Hooff says that in the
future, as WALT appears on more
music lists, the station will receive
greater numbers of new releases
from record labels.

WALT’s executive commit-
tee makes an effort to provide daily
news, all of which must be ap-
proved by WALT’s news director
before being broadcast.

Other features include special
programming which can be heard
on Sundays and on weekday eve-
nings. “We want to provide a
segment of programming thatis all
one genre or one basic theme,”
says Foy. Such programs include
segments which offer strictly 80s
tunes, jazz, or women’s rock.

Davidson’ s first serious move-
ment to create a campus radio sta-
tion in the 70s resulted in WDAV.
WDAV “was éxactly what college
radio should be” says Foy. How-
ever, due to on-air acts of student
impropriety, the station gave re-
strictions on broadcast content
which encroached upon students’
air time. Soon, the station was
abandoned, and its studio was van-
dalized by angry students.

The continued push for stu-
dent radio resulted in the creation
of new stations on and off through-

out the 80s. Funding and adminis-
trative approval was difficult to
secure due to the unpleasant his-
tory of student stations.
Eventually, however, the ex-
istence of a true student-run radio
station seemed increasingly pos-
sible. Foy says that Dean of Stu-
dents Thomas Shandley “encour-
aged efforts to start things up

again.”

Mike Guggenheimer has been
a WALT DJ since the station first
took to the air last semester. In
keeping with WALT’ s stated goals,
he says, “I’m a DJ because I love
music, and I have a wide range of
musical interests. I like to play
stuff people may not have heard
before.”

Jen Rawlings found that her
language skills improved signifi-
cantly through daily interaction
with her French host family. “They
wouldn’t let me speak English at
all,” she says.

“At first it was difficult,” she
says of life with her hosts, “be-
cause I was trying to be perfect.
But you just have to be yourself ...
it’s not as easy as it sounds.”

During the weekends, partici-
pants explored France and sur-
rounding countries. Between ex-
cursions organized by the Davidson
program and individual opportu-
nities, students ventured to many
different places. They were able to
travel to such sites as the prehis-
toric caves of Dordogne, countless
chateaus, Venice, Florence,
Amsterdam, and Corsica.
