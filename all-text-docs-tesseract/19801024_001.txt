WDSAR still
in midst of
organizing

By ANNE GOODWIN
Staff Writer

WDSR, the new student car-
rier current radio station, will
begin broadcasting sometime
before Thanksgiving, according
to station spokesman John
Odell. d

The station has. been slow
getting on the air because of
problems with equipment and
organization.

Odell said at the beginning of
the term (Davidsonian, Sept.
19) that the station would be
broadcasting by October.

One problem has been the age
of some of WDSR’s equipment.
Much of it uses old-fashioned
radio tubes, Odell said. Many
worn tubes have recently failed.

Odell said the station has
been able to buy replacement
tubes, which are fairly cheap.

Another problem has been
finding disc jockeys.’ Over 30
students signed up to work for
the station, Odell said. These
students were then asked to fill
out schedules so the station
could allocate shifts. Fewer
than 15 have returned their

The waterproofing continues

PIRG nets enough to live another year

By SCOT MYERS
Staff Correspondent

The Davidson chapter of
NC-PIRG (North Carolina Pub-
lic Interest Research Group) is
not in danger of folding, accord-
ing to PIRG member Geoff
Little.

The NC-PIRG state board
decided in a recent executive
meeting to allow the chapter to
continue, Little said.

Earlier this summer, the
board considered discontinuing
the Davidson chapter because
of a sharp drop in funds the
chapter collected last year.

This year, Davidson PIRG
collected $520, considered suf-
ficient by the board tor its
continuation.

The drop last year was the
result of a change in billing
procedures. Prior to the 1979-80
school year, a four dollar con-
tribution to PIRG was included
in every student’s comprehen-
sive fee. Last fall, College
President Samuel Spencer de-
cided to switch to a positive

check-off system, requiring stu-

dents to add $4 to their bills if
they wished to support PIRG.

A student referendum last
October supported Spencer’s
decision.

. As a result of the positive
check-off system, PIRG collect-
ed only $200 last year, as
opposed to $4000 in the pre-
vious year.

$200 was not sufficient to
meet Davidson's obligation as a

PIRG member. The seven mem-
ber schools of NC-PIRG, Da-
vidson, Elon, Duke, UNC-
Greensboro, Wake Forest, St.
Andrews, and Guilford, each
keep $200 and ten percent of all
their annual funds. The rest is
sent to the state organization to
pay the salaries of the four
full-time staff members and to
contribute to a central fund
from which all member chapters
can withdraw money for extra
expenses. The staff collects
data for PIRG publications and
advises member chapters in
their work with environmental

and government agencies.

This year, however, David-
son PIRG collected $520, Little
said, which is more than enough
to keep PIRG alive for at least
one more year. About half of
this money will go to the state
staff.

Davidson PIRG’s main prob-
lem is lack of interest among the
student body, Little said. It is
currently comprised of twelve to
fifteen students. At the moment
there is no chairperson. This
year they plan to elect a four
member board.

EPC proposes new, more

By ELIZABETH KISS
News Editor

Next year’s freshman class
will have to follow a more
specific core curriculum, if the
faculty approves proposals re-
leased Tuesday by the Educa-
tional Policy Committee (EPC).

The committee’s major re«
commendations include require-
ments that students show
mathematics proficiency; and
pass one course each in econom-
ics, philosophy, and non-West-
ern studies, and four terms of a
foreign language.

Discussion of the proposal
will begin in a faculty hearing
next Monday at four. Students
may raise questions at an open
meeting next Wednesday at 10
in Perkins Auditorium.

In order for the new core
curriculum to affect the class of
1985, the faculty must approve
the proposals and make all
necessary course changes by
February, according to EPC
Chairperson and Academic Vice
President Price Zimmermann.
The deadline falls in February
because all submissions to the
catalog must be in by that time.
Any new requirements must
appear in the catalog.

The EPC report calls for a
two-part core curriculum con-
sisting of a set of competency
requirements in composition,
mathematics, and foreign lan-
guage, and a set of distribution
requirements. (see excerpts of
page 5)

The math competency would
require students to pass a
mathematics class or a profic-
iency test. Currently students
may graduate without taking
any mathematics courses.

The foreign language compe-
tency would require students to
complete four terms of a lan-
guage instead of three. The
fourth term would have to be
taken at Davidson; students
could be exempt from the first

specific core curriculum

three terms on the basis of a
proficiency test. EPC student
members Elizabeth Medlin and
Bill Purcell submitted an ap-
pendix to the report opposing
the addition of the fourth term.

The composition competency
requirement would remain the
same.

The proposed distribution re-
quirements specify that stud-
ents must take basic courses in
each of five areas. Only courses
which are ‘‘broad, systematic
introductions to assumptions,
methods, and subject matters
of the particular discipline’’ will
fulfill the requirement. In some
departments, students may
now take any course, including
specialized upper-level courses,
to fulfill an area requirement.

A course which satisfies the
proposed distribution require-
ments ‘‘doesn’t have to be a 101
course,”’ Medlin said. For ex-
ample, Purcel] pointed out,
astronomy would fulfill a sci-
ence requirement because it
introduces the student to many
of the basic aspects of physics.

If the faculty approves the
proposals, the EPC will confer
with departments to decide
which courses fulfill the distri-
bution requirements. While
many existing courses ‘‘will
suffice,"’ according to the com-
mittee report, ‘‘it will be neces-
sary in other cases to revise
existing courses or to introduce
new ones.”’

The proposed distribution re-
quirements require a philosophy
and an economics course and
one course in a new area,
Non-Western Studies.

In Area. (Literature and the
Fine Arts) students would: have.
to pass one course in the fine
arts and one in English or
American literature. Currently
students must take three
courses in Area I, but can use
composition as well as literature

Faculty questions plans for new computer center

By MARVIN OVERBY
Staff Writer

Davidson’s planned computer center may
have the official support of the faculty,
administration, and Trustees, but some
faculty members question how well-groun-
ded this support is.

Several professors in departments out-
side mathematics and science said the
faculty approved the computer program

in ignorance. Missing information included: -

—there was no official estimate of the
cost of the computer system:

A News Analysis

—there was no estimate of the amount of
the National Science Foundation (NSF)
grant the College is seeking to underwrite
some of the computer program’s costs;

—few professors were consulted about
the new computer.

According to Computer Services Director —

Robert DeSieno, a precise cost estimate is
not yet available. DeSieno did, however,
give a ball park figure of $500,000 to the
faculty at their October 8 meeting. The
extra costss of training the large number of
students and faculty needed to form the
“critical mass" of people with computer
experience will push that figure up,
DeSieno said.

Chemistry Professor and Assistant Dean
of the Facutly Nicholas Burnett, a member
of the Computer Service Planning Commit-
tee, added that no cost estimate will be
available until the College chooses a specific
computer system.

The estimate most frequently quoted as
the total cost of the program is between
$750,000 and $1 million, according to
Physics Department Chairman Locke
White.

The NSF limited its grants to $250,000,
White said. DeSieno, who has been a

member of NSF panels for the review of

grants proposals, said the money from the
grant would be used to teach computer
usage to students and faculty members to
conduct summer workshops in computer
training. DeSieno estimated Davidson's
chance of being awarded an NSF grant at
25' le

DeSieno was upset to learn that some
faculty members felt poorly informed about
the computer center. He said that the
faculty had received a detailed report from
him describing the computer program on
September 25.

In the report DeSieno listed the following
assumptions about Davidson:

—The mission of the College is to offer a

superior liberal arts education.

—Davidson College must be a leader
among liberal arts colleges in the field of
computer services.

—The availability of a modern compre-
hensive computer system will be essential
