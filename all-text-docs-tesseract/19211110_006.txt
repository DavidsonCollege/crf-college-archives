PROGRESS ON “QUIPS AND
CRANKS” IS ENCOURAGING

When the Davidsonian reporter visit-
ed the different members of the Quips
and Cranks staff, he found them all
optimistic over the prospects for a good
annual this year. Of course it’s a little
early to say just what’s what, but Rod
Shaw, the Editor-in-Chief, stated that
all the departments were getting well
under way with their work. The per-
sonal histories are nearly all in and al-
most all the senior write-ups have been
completed. ;

D. L. Mahood, in charge of the literary
department, stated that some of the
class histories and poems had been writ-
ten. He asks that anyone having any
short poems of campus interest, turn it
in to him as.soon as possible. Johnnie
Curry is hard at work on the “Wildcat
Weekly” which is to be the fun depart-
ment of the annual. He also requests
that any one having a good joke or story
turn it in to him. This is a very im-
portant department of the annual and
this year it is hoped to make it better
than ever.

McIlwaine reports that the art work
is almost complete... There are a number
of good artists in school this year and
they have gotten up some clever draw-
ings. Ray Doubles will have a top-notch
Athletic department.

The staff decided to dedicate this
year’s annual to our mothers and es-
pecially our “College Mother,” Mrs, Rob-
son.

The faculty again this year approved
the giving of three dollars by each stu-
dent to help meet the expenses of pub-
lishing the annual. The engraving is to
be done by the Bureau of Engraving,
Minneapolis. With— the co-operation
of all, this year’s Quips and Cranks will
be one of the best yet.

Senior-Junior Game.

Wednesday night the Senior quintet,
last year’s champions lost their second
game of the season to the tune of 36 to
16 in a vain attempt to down the prom-
ising Junior crew. The game was fast
and hard-fought throughout but espec-
ially so during the second half. Time
and time again Referee Chalmers was
forced to call fouls on both sides.

When the first half ended the score
stood 12 to 10 in favor of the Juniors.
The Seniors came back with a rush in
the second half and tied the score but
from then on they were hopelessly out-
classed. As soon as a Senior forward
would attempt to shoot a Junior guard
would be on him and invariably would
break up his shot.

In all it was the Junior’s night and
cheer leader Crawford kept up the pep
of the Junior supporters throughout the
entire game.

It would be hard to name the individ-
ual stars of the evening but for the
Juniors Mauze outshone hi¢ teammates.
He was a wizard at finding the basket,
his long shots and uncanny accuracy in

shooting fouls counting for a goodly
number of the Junior points. Houghton
also played a good game. For the

Senjors, Ormond, Doubles and Price
showed up well.

The line-up and score was:

Juniors (36) Seniors (16)

Houghton (10) ----- Becceces Ormond (2)
Brake ( 4) --------- Messcees Doubles (10)

Senior-Fresh Game.
The Senior five defeated the Fresh-
men in a hard fought game Friday
night by the score of 41 to 29. The up-

erclassmen went into the fray determin-|

ed to even up the count, as the Fresh de-
feated them in their previous encounter
by one point. The victory put the Sen-
iors again in the lead for class basket-
ball honors, but the three other class
teams are still fighting hard, and the
present’ standing may be upset before
long. However, the Seniors at present
look like the best bet for carrying away
the coveted honor.

The first-half was fast and hard-
fought, but the guarding was close, and
not until the last few minutes were the
Seniors able to forge ahead by several
baskets. But from the opening of the
last half to the final whistle Captain
Ormond’s men played a classy brand of
ball which kept the Freshmen puzzled
and soon the upperclassmen had piled
up enought points to put them out: of
danger. Here the Scrubs were put in,
the Freshmen took on new life and the
encounter almost developed into a “bat-
tle royal,” but the time was too short
for them to do serious damage.

Ormond was the chief point-getter of
the frolic, paving the way with six field
goals, besides playing a classy floor
game. Neal's’ shooting Was nothing
short of spectacular.
