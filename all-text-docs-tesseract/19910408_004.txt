heard something fall on the floor,
and went to investigate.: He
then found the machine to be

than an attack.

The movie suggested several
paths of action for avoiding rape.
Co-eds were warned not to prop
open doors or otherwise provide
easy means of access to dormito-
ries. Also, women should avoid
isolated areas and walking alone.
For the prevention of date rape,
women should make sure to avoid
mixed signals and should back
up their words with concurring
actions. Being intoxicated puts
women at more risk, making it
harder for them to communicate
their limits.

Carlson and Kelly com-
mented after the film on the many

myths and misconceptions that con-
tinue to pervade the Davidson cam-
pus. Mostincoming freshmen falsely
believe that nothing that bad can
happen at the school because we are
bound by the Honor Code. In fact,
rape is one of the largest problems
on campuses today in terms of
numbers. Unfortunately, many are
afraid to come forward with their
stories and mostrapes go unreported.

The committee wanted to make
clear the number of resources vic-
tims have available at Davidson. Be-
sides the obvious option of the po-
lice, the Dean of Student’s office,
Chaplain’s office and counseling
center will all schedule confidential,
mediated meetings in which the vic-
tim andattacker can discuss the situ-
ation,

was in line at the city hall when a
boy rushed in announcing that the
SS was rounding up boys to work
in mills in Germany. Everyone
knew the heavy bombing in that
area of Germany made it so that to
work in the mills meant probable
death. At that momenta man with
the SS walked in. Somehow, while
the SS officer’s attention was di-
verted, another man grabbed him
from behind, took him in a side
room, gave him his papers, and let
him out a side door. The man
probably saved his life. Mond
regrets never having been able to
find the man and thank him.
Three days after that incident
he returned to Antwerp where he
learned his sister was caught in a
raid in Austria. The family de-
cided to attempt to reach Switzer-
land through France. He, his
mother, and his sister spoke French
fluently. His father, however,
didn’t speak a word. They decided
he should pretend to be deaf and
dumb for the duration of the trip.
They took a train to Paris.
Eventually, with the help of
the underground, they made _it.to

beautifying our community. The
Cleanup is like a walk-a-thon ex-
cept that instead of simply walking
to raise funds for the hungry and
homeless, we’ll be simultaneously
focussing our energy on helping
ourcommunity. Forexample, we’ll
volunteer a few hours to clean a
playground, work with recycling,
or pick up trash in local neighbor-
hoods. You raise funds by asking
your friends and family to sponsor
you for the hours you work at these
projects. By joining the effort
you'll be fighting hunger and
homelessness, both in Davidson
and around the world, while hav-
ing fun and knowing you’re mak-
ing a difference. So take a some
time this weekend to focus your
“Spring Frolicking.” A few hours
of selflessness can make a world of
difference!

Lyon in southem France. There
they could not stay in the same
hotel more than one night or the
room would be raided. The family
did not sleep in the same location
for safety’s sake, and one of these
nights Mond was planning to sleep
in a park. In the park he met.a
prostitute who took him back to
sleep in a hotel. That night the
hotel was raided. Unbelievably,
. ay

every room in the hotel was
searched except for the one where
he was sleeping. The concierge
had told the guards that an ex-
hausted businessman was sleeping
and should not be disturbed.

The family eventually founda
guide to lead them into Switzer-
land. One day and night they
walked 10 miles until they were 2
miles from the border. There the
guide told them he would not es-
cort them right up to the border.
That was not the agreement that
had been made, but that point the
family had no choice but to walk
over alone. They walked over a
mountain pointed out to them by
the guide, and descended into a
town. It was 5 in the morning at
that point. Mond walked up to a
house and tapped on the window.

A man appeared, and Mond asked _ ~

August 4, in time for the return of
students for the school yearon Au-
gust 18.

Students in the new apartments
pay the College’s single-room rate
of $2,511 per school year for those
accommodations. They will also
be automatically billed $5 per stu-
dent per month for the cable televi-
sion access that is included in each
room.

Apartment-style buildings
have proven highly popular with
students. Since room assignments
on campus are made on a lottery
system that give higher priority to
older students, all of the apart-
ments are expected to be occupied
by seniors and juniors.

if this was Switzerland. The man
at the window said it was indeed,
and gave them some dry clothes
and took them to get their papers in
order. The family and all the other
refugees that reached Switzerland
that week were accepted. The
following week the government
rejected all refugees requesting
entry.

After the war, Mond returned
to Belgium. He found that his sis-
ter died in a crematorium at
Auschwitz. Forty-one of the forty-
three members of his high school
class died in the war.

Mond wanted to make it clear
that his life was saved by the in-
credible kindness of other people.
Three Christian families risked
their lives to hide and help him. He
also wanted to say that he does not
hate the German people. Germans
also risked their lives to hide Jews
in the country, while some Jews
actually turned in other Jews to
save themselves.

Mond came to the United States
in 1954. He found work in New
York, and eventually married and
raised three children. Today Mond
lives with his wife in Charlotte.

could not ever produce children
without these embryos, then this
consideration would outweigh the
man’s desire not to be a father.

However, if the woman could
find a partner willing to fertilize
more eggs, the man’s interests
would prevail. Also, Dr. Robertson
believes that one resultof the Davis
case might be that couples: will
make agreements forseeing such
future possibilities.

Dr. Robertson concluded his
talk with a short discussion of
sperm donation and _ surrogate
motherhood. He believes that both
should be allowed and subject to
contracts between the three par-
ties.
