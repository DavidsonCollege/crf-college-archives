Whatever the fans
in Charlotte may think

of Davidson, none
ean deny that the
1949 edition of the

Wildeats have given
Charlotte some of ‘the

fanciest and _ most
thrilling basketball
that has been seen

around the Queen City
in many a day. And
those who filed in to

take a seat in the
Armory just before
the opening ‘whistle
Tuesday night knew

that they could expect

to see a well-drilled,
dead-eye faney basketball team from Davidson on the floor
that night. Also with the opposition being provided by Coach
Tom Seott's White Phantoms from the University of North
Carolina, they knew to expect a good ball game, and they
really got it.

It was nip and tuek all the way and Davidson controlled
the floor game, while setting up several nice plays ‘which
failed beeause of a missed shot. The only thing which kept
Carolina in the ball game was their accuracy when, by faking
off a close guard, they could pump ‘em in from outside the foul:

cirele, They also controlled the backboards for a good part of
the’ first half but this could not be said of the second half
when the whole Cat team went in for the rebounds and got
more than their share of them. Especially noticeable was the
return of Buddy Cheek to his last year’s All-Southern form in
the scoring department which he led with 19 points and also
in the ball handling and floor work department
handled with a smooth style.

Another noticeable thing was the smooth ball playing of
freshman Bill Brooks in the preliminary tilt with CCUNC,
Brooks threw them with equal dexterity with either hand
from short distances. He should prove to be a valuable player
with the varsity next year. The freshmen rolled over the
team that beat Lees-McRae, one of the few conquerors of the
Kittens, with little diffieulty, although Bill Proctor for the
Owls kept the game interesting. Bobby Turk was limping on
an injured ankle and Brady Osborne filled in for him quite
capably by pouring through 18 points. Davidson’s frosh are

having quite a season and give the Cat followers hopes of
some strong teams for the next few years.
The varsity starts another swing into South Carolina this

“+ week-end with a game at Columbia Thursday night with the

Gamecocks who are bound to give trouble because it will be
their last ditch battle to get into the tournament. South Caro-
lina and Duke are fighting it out for that eighth tourney
position and the Carolina team and student body are sure to
be out for blood when the Davidson hoopsters roll into town.
Friday night the Cats take on College of Charleston and Sat-
urday night the Citadel. These two games should fatten the
won-lost record and not give too much trouble either, :

The outlook for the tournament battles will be better if
Davidson remains in the fourth spot because ‘we will then be
in the opposite bracket from the classy N, C. State Wolfpack
and have a much better chance of reaching the finals or even
winning the tourney, William and Mary will be a hard team
to beat as will George Washington. If North Carolina knocks
Duke out of the tournament, all together Davidson will be
much better off because Duke seems to be the.nemesis of the
Nardwooders, having conquered the Ca yice-while losing to
many other teams, some of ‘them definitely inferior to David-
son, Another meeting between the Cats and-Phantoms is not
unlikely and jwould be a thriller, indeed. Our money would
certainly be on Davidson if this game should materialize.

One of the deciding factors in the way the basketball team
has developed this year has been the showing made by the
unsung substitutes who have come through in several games
to provide the spark for a close victory. Chief among these
rapidly improving players is Ed Hopper, the senior from
Meridian, Miss. Ed adds a lot of needed height to the lineup
when he is in and his springy jumping ability enables him to
get up there with the tallest, He is also a generous contributor
to the team’s .716 free throw average which is the best in
the nation by 22 percentage points over Kentucky. The latest
addition to the ranks of dependable subs is Tommy Haller,
who played for a good many minutes.in the Clemson game
and turned in a nice performance iwhile dropping in one field
goal. With two more years of eligibility, Haller has the ability
to develop into,a top flight performer.

Although basketball is the headliner in the sports picture
on the campus, spring football and wrestling are continuing
with the football squad butting heads regularly down on the
freshman field. With the warm weather other activity 1s
springing up on Richardson Field and in the gym. The bat-
teries of the college nine are working out and limbering up
their arms while the tennis team is cranking up to get started
with the return of Coach Barton.
