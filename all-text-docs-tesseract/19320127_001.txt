Dr. Lingle Attends
Important Meetings

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of Davidson
College, was in Philadelphia yesterday for the
second time recently to attend a conference of
the corporators of the Presbyterian Ministers’
Fund. His previous visit to the Quaker City on
January 7. was for a meeting of this same con-
ference. Between the two trips to Philadelphia
he attended a three-day session of the Associa-
tion of Colleges and Universities in Cincinnati,
January 20-22, and in the interim visited his
daughter in Boston.

Dr. Lingle filled the pulpit in the First Pres-
byterian Church in Lexington, N. C., January
10, and will preach there again on February 7.

On January 17 he gave two sermons here inj}

the local Presbyterian Church and on January

31 and on February 14 he will deliver sermons |

in Presbyterian churches in and

Shelby, respectively.

Dean Herring's subject was given in the formywhile he is there for several days in March,

of a question, “What are our attitudes toward
law?” He showed how nature was directed by
definite laws, and the universe and all lower
forms of life had laws which had to be obeyed
in order to” prevent great disturbances and
griefs. Man may not know all the laws of na-
ture, but they are present and prevent chaos in
the universe. “Laws are not made, but discov-
ered.”

Throughout the ages man has sought to |
discover safe, sane, and just moral laws by
Which to control his actions. He has built up|
a code which, if ignored, will bring the inevit- |
able consequences. Every law in this code has |
something of a moral command which all know, |
but alk do not obey. Everyone knows the Ten |
Commandments and the moral imperativeness of |
each one, but

Man has logic which says, “Every cause has |
effect. Every effect has cause.” |

everyone does not obey them. |

|
We have civil |
laws because we must live together, in contact |
with one another, Through experience of liy- |
ing together, law has been built up and devel
oped to its present state. This law is made up
of three types: civil, moral, and the law of con- |
ventions.

In this country we have been so busy cbtare|
and getting, that we have not had time to build |
up moral principles in our hearts and minds. |
Man is groping around for moral standards. At |
the same time man wants to be amused; he will |
be amused even if he has to laugh and scoff |
at the basic moral laws. When the time comes |
that men laugh at their standards of conduct, |
it is time to think aboutsthe fundamentals. of
living. Such a time is before us now, What are |
we, as college men, going to do about it? What!
can we do to help the present conditions? In|
the economic field the laws of economics are
not wrong. They have not all been discovered.
Laws which will take care of the conditions of
the present, when food is rotting while men |
are starving, are’yet to be discovered. We should
try to find

cases.
