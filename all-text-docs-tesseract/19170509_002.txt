COMMENCEMENT.

There will be a Commencement. An
erroneous opinion has permeated the stu-
dent mind and -has even spread among
the alumni. The. thoughts of war and
the “back to the farm” movement have
naturally created this false impression.
This falsity—the idea of a short and of-
little-rate Commencement—we — want
to correct. It is true that Commence-
ment closer earlier. But it is also true
iment closes earlier, But is is also true
emphatically stated to a representative
of the Senior class that it. was scheduled
for three days with the idea that more
guests would come.

The great privilege for which the Sen-
iors have been waiting for four years is
almost here. To take away the activi-
ties concerned with “getting a dip"
would be disappointing. With the ex-
ception of the omission of the literary ad-
dress there is no disposition on the part
of the Faculty to deny them this privi-
lege. The Faculty has good reasons for
not having this in the program.

All friends, alumni and patrons are
cordially invited to attend these ‘exer-
cises. The college welcomes you. The
members of the student body desire your
presence. Your coming confers an honor
upon the members of the Senior class.
They have worked faithfully and are
due your attendance and other honors
and tributes which you may pay at their
graduation.

COLONEL SCOFIELD.

No wreath, tribute, nor tear can ex-
press the feeling of our student body for
the passing away of our friend—Col-
onel Scofield. For more than forty years
he has known and befriended students
of the College. He took a great interest
in the College and in the students. No
one took greater pride and found more
jov than he in relating to us the tra-
ditions and historv of the institution in
its earlier days. When he was disposed.
he always had an appreciative audience
of college bovs who heard him with a
feeling of admiration and pleasure. OF
these groups President Wilson is the
most distinguished—who for hours hac
talked with the charming story teller
During the last few years. when in‘de-
‘clining health, he did not know the new
men so well. He knew a host of grad-

ales and was deeply interested in ther
nd was glad to hear of their succes

‘he alumni in returning were alway
elcomed by him.

The deeply felt sympathy of Davidso-
yen wherever they are goes out in mv
tal feeling to those bereaved. Great!
‘o we miss our warm friend—honore

ag Father.

DAVIDSON AND THE MINISTRY.

In our editorial sanctum we hav:
ame catalogs of Presbvterian seminarie
“hich give some interesting data as t
‘epresentation. Davidson is one of th
Thurch colleges of the South. She i:
ducating more men for the ministr
than any other institution connecter
‘vith our Church, And as far as we ca’
Gnd, our institution is sending out morc
men for this field than anv college of
any denomination in the South. Th
inference is easy—cum magna lauda.

At Louisville the number of student
in undergraduate courses is fifty. In
stitutions represented are twenty-four
Davidson sends four men. There is onl
one other college having a larger repre
centation—Westminster College having
Six. .
Columbia Seminary has fifty-nine stu-
dents in all coures. Here, too, twentv-
four institutions are represented. Dav-
idson has the largest representation—
fourteen. The next highest representa-
tion is six.

Tn all the courses at Union there are
one hundred and seven students. Rather
singularly, there are twenty-four insti-
tutions in representation. Davidson fur-
nishes half—there beine fifty-three of
Red and Black spirit. The next highes:
college represented is Hamnden-Sidne
—having eleven; followed by Washing
ton and Lee—sending ten.

These figures partially account for
the wholesome atmosphere and _— sniri*
which exists on our campus. These facts
show that Davidson is lining up with

the Church.
ALUMNI GIFT.

The gift from che Alumni to the Col-
lege is being realized. It is going to be
an attractive and well japportioned
building, and is ideally located on the
campus. You could not have given wu
a more needed gift nor one that would
be more appreciated. The gymnasium
will be modern in every respect and
will be a great addition to our equip-
ment.

We receive this as a token of your
true love and loyalty for your Alma
Mater. When we see this handsome
finished product to the memory of the
Alumni, students now and in the future
will know that it is indicative of a spirit
of apnreciation. ‘This brings College
and Alumni in closer relation. The stu-
dent mind was replete with joy when
work was begun on the site.

Last Commencement witnessed the
temporary laying of the ‘cornerstone.
This Commencement marks a rapid
stage in the building. Attend this Com-
mencement and see the progress of your
investment—for it will then be well un-
der way. The Senior class wants vou at
their Commencement. Dr. J. L. Doug-
las, Chairman of the Reunion Commit-
tec, wants. for the College. to have as
many of the Alumni to return as can
oescibly do so. It will be worth your
while to mingle with old friends and to
strengthen your love for Davidson.

THE FARMER RILL.

Some students realizing the situation
on the farm—shortage of crops, labor
nroblems, and necessity of large nro-
Avction—initiated a petition to the Fac-
ulty requesting that they be allowed to
return home and immediately — begin

D of the direct advantages to be gained from
printing that will catch the eye and hold it long@
enough to create a favorable attitude on the part of
the buying public? Printing of the ordinary kind
has become so weatherbeaten by unlimited usage
that the impression formed in the mind of the busi-
ness man of to-day is one of continuous and depress-
ing sameness—a tendency to cause a “look-
arourd-more” disposition on the part of him who
wants something just a little different, if not entirely
distinctive, when compared with the current station-
ery that reaches his office.

We invitea careful and studied analysis of the
samples we always keepon hand for your inspection.
It isthe aim and purpose of each unit that goes to
make up the Presbyterian Standard Publishing Co.
to lend every effort possible to satisfy a customer

absolutely. A thorough test will furnish any proof desired. i
Let as quote you priceson any printing that is ordinarily—or extraordinarily— ha
used in the modern commercial field.

ADIOS.

Adios is a Spanish idiom. “To save Dr.
Grey the trouble—it is translated “good-
‘we. Recently we read an attractive
Vittle article, “The Editor As Human
Being.” The writer really thought that
there were some humanistic characteris-
tics of editors. He says that the hearts
of editors are gnawed by serpents that
twell in their breasts—whose venoms
coursing thru their veins drive them
hither and yon. ‘This venom had been
the pleasure of editing your paper—and
indeed it has been a pleasure. Getting
out a paper has some hurried sensations
—some hither and yons. But now the
hither and yons will be a pleasure (?)
of another degree. It would be a pleas-
ure to us to get out a paper to cheer
vou up and to divert your mind from
examinations, or to furnish you some-
thing to read to the people on the farm
or to help you to be journalistically in-
clined at Oglethorpe or McPherson.
The sum total is we are human beings

In whatever field of activity you may
go, the staff wishes you everv success—
wishes that your summer may be spent
‘na most profitable way. We say good-
bve with the hope that all of the three
classes below Senior will return, and
with the trust that this publication mar
olay a great part in your future college
career, To the men of ‘17 we rejoice ir
the successes which are in the future for
vou, We wish that the best of fortune
wav smile brightly upon vou in vour
life of a new svhere. Farewell! a
satriotic farewell until another session
