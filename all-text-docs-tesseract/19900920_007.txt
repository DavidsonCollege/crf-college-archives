Transfers Give High
Marks. to. Davidson

By JENNIFER SIECK

Davidson College gained over
thirty new students in January of
1990 and this fall. These students

| arenotfirst-year students, but trans-

fers. .
They come to Davidson any-

time after their first semester at

another school. They are geo-
graphically diverse, coming from
as far away as Maine and the
People’s Republic of China and
from as close by as Huntersville

——and-Mooresville; North Carolina, —

They represent a variety of
different kinds of students as well:
international transfers, “tradi-
tional” transfers, (American col-
lege students between the ages of
18 and22,) andadult transfers who
are returning to college to earn
their bachelor’s degree.

Transfers, while unique, do
share many common interests with
four-year Davidson students.
Transfer students apply to
Davidson for some of the same
reasons that first-year students do.
Academic challenge, a small
school, and professors who give
students personal attention are all
reasons that transfers come to
Davidson.

Leigh Hamrick, who is a
sophomore transfer student enter-
ing Davidson this fall from Berry
College in Rome, Georgia, com-
mented, “Davidson hasachalleng-
ing program. It has a reputation
that isnot justan empty shell: ithas
the meat in it.” °

Adult transfer student Tom
Lorenzin, aresidentof Mooresville,
North Carolina who has studied at

the University of Illinois and UNC-
Charlotte, has found the acadmic
life thus far “invigorating, to say
the least.” He added: “I have not
been in a boring class.”

Transfers agree that Davidson
offers much more than just class-
room education, however. ROTC,
Habitat for Humanity, ~ the
Women’s Concerns Commitice,
Intervarsity, Artist Series, and
Amnesty International are just a
few of the programs in which trans-
fers actively particpate.

ife--also—longingly-at_ flyers forlate nights —

presents an opportunity to get in-
volved in the campus life. Robert
Vanderford, who transferred as a
junior this fall from Catawba Col-
lege in Salisbury, North Carolina,
feels that people at Davidson are
“warm and amiable” and “willing
to include you.”

Another transfer, Gail Ruff,
who came to Davidson last spring

from the University of Florida, said »

she was meeting people gradually
since she transferred mid-year.
However, she also said that “people
aren’t receptive to new people,”
Hamrick found Berry Col-
lege’s student body to be more
“laid-back” than Davidson “aca-
demically oriented” students.

Another difficulty for this fall’s

transfer students is that most live
off-campus because of the housing
crunch. Living off-campus has
advantages and drawbacks, accord-
ing to Vanderford, Hamrick, and
Ruff. Vanderford enjoys having
quict studying time and some se-

Patterson Court Welcomes
Freshmen Today

Today, freshmen will finally
de able to hit Patterson Court after
four wecks of waiting patiently.
Freshmen and upperclassmen alike
are ready for the big weckend.

‘But wait a second. Shouldn’t
freshmen know a few facts about
the court? In 1960, Patterson Court
was built to replace the old frater-
nity houses on Jackson Court. Dr.
William. S. Patterson, who was a
Pika, is the man for whom the
courtis named. According to Dean
of Students Will Terry, Patterson
was a Presbyterian preacher from
Davidson.

Terry approximates that about
60 percent of men and 80 percent
of women joinahouse on the court.
There are a total of 12 houses on
the court--three women’s eating
houses, six fraternities, the Black
Students Coalition (BSC), a house
being used for students to live in,
and one vacant house. Davidson
also has one off-campus fraternity.

In 1971, Davidson began the
policy of self-selection for fresh-
men and others wanting to join a
fraternity or eating house. The
policy’s purpose was to make the
houses open to all who were inter-
ested in joining.

While self- selection bas beeii
a great success with eating houses,
many question its effectiveness
with fraternitics who give out bids
to prospective members. Terry
says that while in past years there
have been students who have sclf-
selected fraternities that have not
given them bids, this is not a fre-
quent occurrence.

In the last four weeks, fresh-
men have found a place for them-
selves at Davidson. Hopefully, they
have adjusted to the academic life,
and gotten scttled into their new
home. No longer will they look

or listen woefully to the strains of
music drifting up from the court.
Yet Terry reminds them that they
should not completely Ict loose
this weekend. “Itis very important
for fraternities and eating houses--
as well as freshmen--to conduct
themselves very carefully, and to
act in a responsible manner,” is
Terry’sadvice to all who will be on
the court this weckend.

The following gives some in-
formation and advice for freshmen
about the Patterson Court. This
information was provided by the
presidents of the houses.

Blues Traveler Has "Jazzy" Sound

Blues Traveler
Blues Traveler
A&M Records

The man can blow! Blues
Traveler’s John Popper is «he man
with a mouth harp. Trained at the
New School of Music and the Jazz
Conservatory, Popper’s harmon-
ica dominates the Princeton, New
Jersey band’s first album. Popper
also plays twelve string acoustic
and sings. His voice isdecent, made

better by his possession of acouple
different styles which he can sing
in, The only bad thing is that while
he’s singin’ he ain’t blowin’.
Chan Kinchla, an old friend of
Cecily Craighill’s is, I believe, the
only band member who has not
received formal jazz training. But
the album isnot jazz (jazzy maybe),
and Kinchla is not hurting on the
guitar. He is acompletely sclfless
musician and almost too much so.
He rarely cuts loose on the album

and I can’t say that I’m sure he
could.

Bobby Sheehan is the bass
toting member of the rhythm sec-
tion and Brendan Hill, from Lon-
don, wields the sticks. They lay
down a formidable current of back
beat over which Popper’s mouth-
piece skips, diving down, swim-
ming in the groove every so often
then resurfacing and flittering ef-
