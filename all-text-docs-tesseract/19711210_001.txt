YSA Faces FBI Investigation

The Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation released word that
the Davidson chapter of the
Young Socialist Alliance has
been under surveillance since
its inception earlier this year.
The organization was formed
under the leadership of Steve
Cross and John Braxton.

The FBI's announcement came
in the wake of charges by Cross
that the agency was indeed
checking on the organization
through illegal wiretapping tech-
niques.

Cross and Braxton are to ap-
pear before a Federal Grand
jury in Greenville, N. C., later

. . . revolutionary

this month.

Haldon P. Washermann, Char-
lotte chief of FBI operations,
ind:cated that the agency had
been following Cross’ activities
as a matter of course. Cross
was listed on the agency's file
of revolutionary people.

Washermann indicated that
Davidson has a bad reputation
with the federal agency.

“As far as we're concerned
that campus is the most poten-
tially dangerous in the state of
North Carolina and perhaps the
entire southeast. They're all
long hairs and radical intellec-
tuals, the kind that have leftist
tendencies even without all of
that use of drugs that goes on
out there.”

Washermann expressed gon-
cern over the establishment of
the socialist organization. “I’m
sure these kids mean well,
they're just misguided. Its peo-
ple like them that the commu-
nists are always taking advan-
tage of. J. Edgar Hoover has
often warned of the danger
from within which comes from
these well meaning dupes of
the red menace.”

Neither Cross nor Braxton was
available for comment on the

Samuel R. Spencer.

Spencer’s announcement was
released to THE DAVIDSON-
IAN yesterday. Spencer said,
“This is a matter which ulti-
mately and immediately affects
the underclassmen at Davidson
now and we wanted them to
know about it first, it seems
only fitting. The decision was
made with them in mind.”

The coeducation proposal was
drawn up by Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M. Be-
van and faculty member Brown
Patterson. The two finished fin-
al preparation of the document
over the Thanksgiving recess,
faculty approval came at a sec-
ret meeting last Monday and
the plan was tentatively ap-
proved by the Trustee Execu-
tive committee by phone late
Tuesday.

Final trustee approval will be
required but neither Spencer or
Bevan. foresaw any difficulties
following the votes by the fa-
culty and executive committee.

The plan calls for both a
merger with Queens College
and the admission of coeds in
Davidson's entering class next
fall. Director of Admission H.
Edmunds White indicated that
there should be little difficulty
in finding the 110 coeds for the
entering class called for by the
report.

“We have been anticipating

FBI disclosures.

Washermann indicated that
the investigations had not yet
uncovered any specific grounds
for charges, but that the agency
was acting in a preventive cap-
acity. ;

“We're just trying to avert
difficulties like the Billy Gra-
ham-Richard Nixon affair. Un-
less these sorts of organizations
are carefully controlled, there’s
no telling when socialists and
hippies are going to demand to
sit in on affairs like that and
spoil them for everyone involv-
ed.”

such a decision for some time
and we have made the contacts
to make such a recruiting ef-
fort successful. We have lists
of qualified applicants submit-
ted to us from high school prin-
cipals and counsellors which
should produce the number of
freshmen called for in the re-
port.

“We anticipate that the de-
cision will have a strong im-
pact on our normal recruiting
efforts as well. In the last few
years we have lost a lot of top
prospects who were put off by
the idea of an all men’s school.”

In addition to the 110 coeds
to be admitted as freshmen, the
college will accept up to 45

coeds as transfer students with
first preference being given to
Queens students and coeds from
women’s schools other: than
those in the Eight College Ex-
change program.

Spencer indicated that the de-
cision had been made not to
accept transfers from the ex-
change program schools _be-
cause of an understanding which
the schools had made upon
agreeing on the program that
they would not attempt to lure
students from other schools.
“Although we are going coed
ourselves we still feel an obli-
gation to that committment
which we still hold as made in

Union Gets Beer?

The College Union will now
probably be able to apply for
a permit to seli beer on the
Davidson campus.

In a surprise move, College
President Samuel R. Spencer
announced his approval of the
idea stating, ‘I think that the
sale of beer on campus is a long
overdue reform.

“It will be one of the most
important innovations made on
this campus since the hiring of
more administrators last year,”
he stated.

Director of the College Union
C. Shaw Smith criticized Spen-
cer for his statement, saying
that he opposed the sale of any
alcoholic beverage on campus.

“I am, however, really afraid
to speak out against the plan
for fear of antagonizing my old
friend and strong adherent of

the idea, Cecil Burney,” Smith

said.

Smith went on to quote a man
of rare breed, a Davidson trus-
tee, to support his beliefs, ‘’Al-
cohol is the devil in liquid
form.”

The ‘‘Spencer Plan” has met
almost universal acceptance
from the student body, many of
whom have overwhelmingly ap-
plauded the foresight of Spen-

Davidsonian Wins Award

“It’s been a long time since I've seen a paper
of this quality entered in competition, I just can’t
believe that it was put out by college students.”

That was the summary comment of the panel
of judges who awarded THE DAVIDSONIAN honor-
able mention in the latest All - American judging.

The paper was judged to fall short in terms of
reporting, accuracy, editorial integrity, and photo-

graphy.

One judge’ mentioned that he had enjoyed the
abstract prints which the college paper ran, but in-

. divated that he thought that photographs were more

appropriate with news stories than abstract woodcuts. .
“Outside of the Schlitz ads, there wasn’t any-

thing in the paper that I enjoyed,” he said.

cer.

One jubilant student was heard
to exclaim, “I knew Sammy
would do something right if he
was given enough time.”

Immediate opposition has
risen from an anonymous SPE,
who announced his intention to
form an ad hoc committee to
oppose the move (and secretly
to bring fraternities back on
campus).

‘‘Personally, I feel that bring-
ing beer on campus would low-
er the calibre of student who
would want to come here. It’s
just like the problem of co-
education. Who would want to
come to Davidson if it had
girls?”’ the secretive SPE sta-
ted.

“If necessary, we will fight
this battle all the way to the
trustees, who have final auth-
ority to veto this proposal,’ he
said.

Spencer seemed adequately
prepared to meet this possibili-
ty.

“I will take a two-month trip
all the way to the tap at Char-
lie’s to study the whole area
of beer consumption by the
Davidson students.

‘When I come back, I am
sure that this whole question
will have worked itself out, to
the mutual dissatisfaction of all
those involved,” Spencer noted
reassuringly.

Speaking candidly, Spencer
went on, ‘““You know something,
I really have had little to do
recently but sit in my office
and admire my brand-new tea
cannister, which I received in
token appreciation for leaving
India.
~ “My latest coup should do
much to make the name Spen-
cer a more welcome one in the
hearts of the entire community.
I think that this move might
make me feel important,” he
said.
