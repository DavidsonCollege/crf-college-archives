Freshmen Open Season

With Oak Ridge Cadets

Traditional Rivals of Yearlings
Bring Strong Team Here

Davidson’s Freshmen will make ‘their bow
on the gridiron Friday afternoon, when they
tackle Oak Ridge Military Academy on
Richardson Field. The contest climaxes three
weeks of preparation by the Wildkittens.

Oak Ridge has furnished the opposition
for the Freshmen in their initial contests
for the past few years, and her teams have
always been tough for the yearlings to con-
quer. Last year the Cadets presented a well-
balanced team that held the Wildkittens to
a 6-6 tie. Friday they bring a team that
has played together for several seasons, in
fact, practically the they had
last year, only stronger.

same team

The visitors will enter the contest favor-
the Kittens due to their 42 to 0
victory over Hargrave Military Academy
last Saturday. Their complete line-up is not
known, but they will have a well-developed
team built around such stars as McCoy, Cap-
tain Gold, Walton, Swishert, Ray, Gilkey,
and Slayton.
