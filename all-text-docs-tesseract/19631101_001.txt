Martins Found Home-Ties
On Their European Trip

The sound of water falling from a fountain and the sight of a snowy-haired, milk-
coated Negro tending the lawn behind the big, white house set a Southern scene for| major from New Bern, is a

an European conversation.

Mrs. D. G. Martin, wife of the
president, settled back in a
chair on her patio to enjoy the
October Indian summer. But her
mind was across the ocean in a
Europe that she and her hus-
band had visited for the past
two months.

The one thing that constantly
amazed and delighted the Mar-
tins on their trip which lasted
from Aug. 8-Oct. 8, was the fact
that many different people who
might call themselves Davidson-
ians kept appearing in the four
countries they visited.

‘The first old friend we met
was Nick Cooper, a Richardson
Scholar here in ’60-61,” Mrs.
Martin said. “Nick was very
glad to see us; he is what you
might call a real Americanphile.
Both he and his family are very
interested in what is going on in
the United States.”’ She said that
Cooper is studying law at Cam-
bridge and that he is the cap-

tain of the rackets team there.

“You probably shouldn't write
this,” she smiled, “but while we
were in Bristol, Nick and his
family took us to the oldest pub
in England.”

Dr. Martin walked up and
grinned, “You’re giving him
the whole picture of our trip,
all right.”

When the Martins moved on
to Oxford, they found that cen-
ter of learning not unpopular
with Davidson people. Professor
Charles Lloyd was there study-
ing for the summer. Geoff Luck:
ock, a Richardson Scholar last
year, and Richard Henson, here
this year, also paid them a call.

“Perhaps the most interest-
ing person we met in Oxford
was Herman Bell of the Class
of '53,° Mrs. Martin comment-
ed. He is a linguist and is do-
ing work in Africa in the area
that will be flooded when the
Aswan Dam is completed. He

New Baptist Group
Hears Minter’s Talk

The newly-formed Baptist Student Union of David-

son heard Dr. W. P. Minter,
speak on “The Negro in the
day in the College Union.

Following the lecture, Dr.
Minter led a discussion of his
topic, the first in a series of
lectures for the semester. The
over-all theme is “The Negro
in the Baptist Church.”

Newsome To Talk
On Great Issues

David Newsome, deputy di-
rector of the Office of North
African Affairs of the Depart-
ment of State in Washington,
D. C., will be the fifth speaker
in the Great Issues Program,
“Emerging Africa.”

Newsome will speak Thurs-
day, Nov. 7, on the topic, “The
United States: Responsibility to
the Emerging Nations,” at 8:15
p.m. in Chambers Auditorium in
an open lecture.

Newsome has been a foreign
service officer since 1947, hav-
ing served in Karachi, Oslo,
Baghdad and London. In May,
1950, he accompanied the Prime
Minister of Pakistan on his state
visit to the United States. In
April, 1958, he received the De-
partment of State Meritorious
Service Award.

Beginning his career in 1938
as a newspaper reporter, New-
some served overseas in the
US. Navy from 1942 to 1946. Re-
leased from service, Newsome
worked for a year as a publish-
er.

Born in California in January.
1918, Newsome received an AB
degree from the University of
California in 1938 and his MS
degree from Columbia Univer-
sity in 1940. From 1940 to 1941
he was a Pulitzer traveling
scholar. In 1960 Newsome at-
tended the National War Col-
lege. He is currently living in

There will be two more meet-
ings before Christmas for the
group which meets every second
and fourth Wednesday of the
month.

During two eerlier orgeni-
zational meetings the group

elected Jay Rogers president.
Other officers ere Hugh Allen,
vice-president, and John Bar-
row, secretery-treasurer. All
are juniors.

According to Vice-President
Allen, the Rev. Quinton M. Per-
reault, western area director of
the North Carolina BSU, was
instrumental in setting up the
local association.

Perreault provided the Bap-
tists, at their earlier sessions,
with information on proper pro-
cedure for organization, as well
as assistance in obtaining future
speakers,

Having worked on an ear-
lier unsuccessful attempt to
establish a Baptist student fel-
lowship at the colfege, Maj.
and Mrs. David Hampton will
be the group’s sponsors. The
Hamptons initiated the forma-
tion of the BSU by sending
out questionnaires to deter-
mine the amount of interest in
such an organization among
Davidson’s some 100 Baptist
students.

The purpose of the local BSU,
Allen said, is “not to compete
with other religious organiza-
tions. We, as Baptists, can con-
centrate our efforts and discuss
our Baptist heritage and prob-
lems facing college students to-
day.” He added that the group
is not limited to Baptists but
open to all students.

Tentatively, the officers plan
to attend the BSU State Conven-
tion in Greensboro this week-
end. They are also making plans
to attend an officers’ convention
to be held next semester in
Raleigh.

At least a B-plus average is
required for membership, and
no more than eight per-cent of
the junior class and 12% per-
cent of the senior class may be
elected.

In London Stephen Wood ap-
peared. This graduate of the
Class of '61 is currently study-
ing in England. “He comment-
ed.” Mrs. Martin said in a pleas-
ed tone, “that Harrison Well-
ford is as fine a representative
of Davidson ds one could ask.”

The ‘62 graduate, brother
of Senior Hill Wellford, is a
Marshal Scholar at Cambridge.
He was married this summer.

Stephen Harding, an English
visitor several years ago, and
Jonathan Lewis, a guest last
year, visited the Martins bafore
they left England.

Traveling on to Franee, the
couple stopped in Aix to visit

Dr. A. V. Goldiere, retired pro- |

fessor of French, who is teach-
ing Americans there this year.
Bob Chumbley, famous Vaga-
bond, also turned up in Aix
where he is taking his junior
year abroad. Mrs. Martin laugh-
ed, “I was sure he would be
sporting a beard, but he only
had a mustache. Chumbley said,
Tm just getting started on my
beard and have decided to grow
it in sections.’”

Senior lovers of military
science will be happy to learn
that Lt. Col. William Adams,
ex-PMS at Davidson, is content-
edly serving a tour of duty with
the Intelligence at Orleans. The
Martins were lucky enough to be
on time to attend the wedding
of his daughter, Meri.

Undoubtedly the most pleas-
ant experience shared by the
couple was their visit with
their son Mike and his French
wife, who are living in a tiny
village in Brittany. The young-
er Martin went to Aix on a
Rotery Fellowship and met
his wife there. He is now writ-
ing fiction.

The Martins even spent a
week on the famous Riviera at
Hyeres. “But it was a spot on the
coast where not many tourists
come,” Mrs. Martin said. “The
water there was as clear as Sil-
ver Springs in Fla.; it was cer-
tainly the most beautiful place
we saw while abroad.”

The pair attended a special
meeting in Zurich, Switzerland,
at which a sizable number of
foreign alumni gathered. Pierre
Wyss-Chodat, one of the earliest
of the Richardson Scholars, help-
ed arrange the gathering. For a
long time he was secretary for
the Foeign Students Association
of Davidson Alumni, an organi-
zation which even put out its
own paper for awhile. It no
longer is a forma) group.

In Bochun-Linden, Ger., the
Martins met a_ very special
foreign acquaintance. Dagmar
Tauber, who two years ago
lived in the Martin’s home while
an exchange student in this
country, arranged a special par-
ty for her American “parents.”
A good many Germans were
there who had been on the
Richardson program in its ear-
lier years.

Faculty Meeting Crucial
To Liberal AP Proposals

3¥ TOM LOFLIN

More than a few Davidson students will watch with interest the action the Facul-

eral probation policy.

The Executive Committee has
already voted on recommenda-
tions it wishes to make to the
Faculty’ concerning academic
probation. President D. G. Mar-
tin said after the committee
meeting that “our proposals to
the Faculty will be much more
liberal than the current policy.”

At the committee meeting,
requests by Dr. J. G. Martin, of
the Dept. of Chemistry; :

Davidsonian Ranks
All-American Class

THE DAVIDSONIAN has been
awarded an All-American rating
in its classification for the
fourth semester in a row by the
Associated Collegiate Press.

The award, highest possible
under the ACP’s rating system,
was for the second semester is-
sues of the paper last year. THE
DAVIDSONLAN scored 3.500 of
3.700 possible points in its classi-
fication as a weekly paper in a
four-year college with an en-
rollment between 751. and 1256
students. Last year, the paper
received a rating of 3620 points.

Editorial page features and
makeup, sports coveragé, writ-
ing, and display, inside: news
pages, headlines and photogra-
phy were among the parts re-
ceiving the excellent rating.
The front page was rated super-
ior and assigned a special score.
Normally an excellent rating
is the highest possible.

Commenting on the publica-
tion, the judges said, “An ex-
ceptionally sound, workmanlike
example of topflight college
journalism.”

considered. Prof. Martin sug-
gested in a prepared paper that
the college’s academic proba-
tion be liberalized in certain
ways.

After the meeting, Pres. Mar-
tin said, “The committee did
not accept all of Prof. Martin's
propositions for liberalizing
academic probation, but we did
approach his ideas ‘in making
our proposals to give to the
Faculty. "

An examination of Prof, Mar-
tin's compromise program to
Tiberaljze academic probation,
and a consideration of the
known steps that the committee
took will provide some clue to
what the Student Body can ex-
pect from the Faculty in regard
to changes in current rules.

Prof. Martin intended to
map out a workable program
that could be used as a corn-
promise between the old aca-
demie probation rules and the
new regulations put into ef.
fect this semester. He desires
three basic and important
changes in the current -pro-
gram:

1. Place students who do not
earn. the equivalent of nine
hours and nine quality points or
who make two F's on academic
probation. The requirements
now are that the equivalent of
12 hours and nine points must
be earned at each grading per-
iod to stay off probation. A stud-
ent may fail two courses and yet
not be placed on probation, if
he meets the 12-9 standard.

2. Permit any student who
brings his grades up to the re-
quirement to be freed from
probation at any grading period.

BY PAUL SIMPSON

; |Students See Honor Court
A Latter-Day Gestapo

More severe than the Inquisition and more heinous than the Gestapo. Like the

FBI, they’re everywhere;

Hunched furtively at their
desks, the roommates trembie;
over each hulks a burly hench-
man; a third holds the door; a
fourth and fifth rifle drawers,
feel suits, ‘pry into trunks, lift
mattresses, smell Listerine and
English Leather—the Honor
Court is on the move.

Asked last week about the
above unreal picture, vividly
painted on the Davidson cam-
pus by the rumor that the Honor
Court planned to search all cars
and rooms for alcohol before,
Homecoming, Chairman Howard
Arbuckle was amazed.

This rumor, and many were
expecting an Honor Court tap
on the door any night, was
but another example of the
gross misconception of David-
son men of Honor and the
Honor Court.

Arbuckle emphasized that
court members are not police-
men sent out on periodic patrols
—even if they did have the
authority to search rooms and
cars. They are not out to ‘‘get”
anyone; there never has been

nor will be “a big crack-down”;

the court does not feel it is slack
in its duties if students are not

occasionally kicked out of|
school. |
Only after suspicion has

arisen does the court attempt
to discover possible violators of
the Honor Code or the Student
Body Regulations.

Another popular myth Ar-
buckle blasted was that “you
don’t have a chance in ovr
Honor Court trials—everyone
is convicted.” He pointed out

that the names of the inno-
cent are never revealed; and
trial procedure is as feir as
any court of law.

The prevalent picture of the
Davidson man going through
four years with one eye cocked
and one ear open for the sight
or sound of an Honor Court
agent calls for a new look at the
Honor System.

As Arbuckle wrote in an intro-
duction to the 1963-64 Honor
Court: “The Honor System at

and like Scotland Yard, they always get their man: thus omin-
arship. He is feature editor of | OUS and omnipotent looms the Honor Court of Davidson in the eyes of her students.

Davidson is the acceptance of
an obligation on behalf of each
student towards every other
student and towards himself to
constantly conduct himself hon-
estly and honorably in all that
he does. The Honor System is
Davidson's method of creating
an environment in which hon-
esty is practiced and respect-
ed.”

As the judicial branch of
the student government, the

ty will take at its meeting next Tuesday on the question of academic probation.
Every indication is that when the meeting is over, Davidson will have a more lib-

At present a student is restrict-
ed for an entire semester once
-he is on probation. Thus, under
the present system, a man may
be placed on AP at the end of
any grading period, but can only
be removed at the end of a
semester.

3. Permit students on proba-
tion to participate in off-cam-
pus school-sponsored activities
as-long as such a student does
not miss any classes, At present
all such participation is out.

Prof. Martin also proposes
that any student who does not
meet academic standards be-
cause one or more of his
course grades are not turned
in (which has happened in the
past) be considered individual-
ly and, if his other grades are
acceptable, not be placed on
probation.

As it is now, the administra-
tion could place a student who
is only carrying 12 hours on
probation if one professor did
not turn in a grade for some
reason beyond the student’s con-
trol.

This would be true even
though such a student were mak-
ing an A average in other.
courses. Such a. tactic would ob-
viously punish severely a man
who could do nothing to alter
the situation.

The action the comniittee
took to permit freshman foot-
ball players to play in off-cam-
pus games while on academic
probation is significant. It in-
dicates one committee proposal
that will be made in the faculty
meeting is to allow students to
participate off-campus even
while on probation.

Prof. Martin propounded
three outstanding reasons as
to why approval by the Facul-
ty of the above proposal would
be both just and valuable to
the college:

“The penalty of prohibiting
participation in organized events
punishes the student who con-
tributes in a way that the non-
participant is not punished.

“Ironically, neither the mem-
ber nor the nonmember of an
extracurricular organization is
prevented from attending off-
campus events, or from engaging
in any other pastime detrimen-
tal to‘his class performance.

“Considering (a) the invest-
ment in many of these and other
activities, (b) the alumni and
student pride and interest, (c)
the publicity value, and (d) the
value to other members when
the group is capable of excel-
lence; the increased require-
ments of the current academic
