Maidens seek enlightened
work handbook, job posting

By ANDREW LAMAS
Senior News Editor

The Chambermaids, a local
group of secretaries, clerks and
stenographers, have presented
the college administration with
a set of three proposals con-
cerning the posting of jobs and
other conditions of employ-
ment.

The organization was formed
in January 1975, in order to
establish an official. line of
communication between its
members and the college
administration.

Although the Chambermaids
do not represent all members of
the secretarial and clerical
staffs, the organization has
been able to gather almost
universal support among its
peers concerning three basic
issues.

Higher parking fine levied,

Traffic Court remains liberal

By RUSS MARTIN
Staff Writer

Parking fines have gone up
this year from five to ten
dollars for on-campus viol-
ations.

Restrictions on parking have
also been changed, and as many
students are finding out every
day, they are being enforced.

Allan Malcolm, working
under the SGA through the
Security Committee, issued 50
tickets in one morning during
the first few days of school.
However, the number of
tickets issued is declining
drastically (from eight to ten
daily) as students become
familiar with the regulations.

“Ten dollars for a parking
fine is a rip-off,” said college
Cashier Sally Washam, but as
Traffic Court member Zach
Long said, “No one has to
worry about a fine if he follows
the rules.”

The reason for the increased
fine is not to take in more
money, according to Long.
’ “The higher you raise the fine,
the lower your revenue is,
because there are not as many
violations,” he maintained.

A five dollar fine in past
years did not seem to deter
students from parking in
service entrances, on the grass,
and in fire lanes, resulting in
inconvenience, damage to

college property, and safety. .

hazards, according to
Patrolman O.S. Carter.

The Security Committee
gave the recommendation to
the college to increase the fines
and set new restrictions last
spring. The new policy took
effect with the start of this
school, year, but it was not
approved by the SGA Senate
until Tuesday. night, Sept. 15.
Those who received tickets
within the six days before the

SGA Senate approved the new
parking policy will be charged

under the new policy, according
to Long.

Parking on the grass,
(anywhere not paved or
gravelled), parking near dump-
sters or in any other areas
marked off by yellow lines, is
illegal. Other areas have been
designated “no parking” areas
with new signs.

Parking stickers must be
obtained within 48 hours of the
arrival of a motor vehicle on
campus. If a car is ticketed
within that period, students
can take the matter to traffic
court, which meets in room 121
Chambers on first and third
Tuesdays.

“I think you can say this is a
fairly liberal traffic court as far
as letting people off who have a
legitimate excuse,” Long said.

During this past summer,
officers of the Chambermaids
submitted to College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. a letter
requesting the administration
to set employment guidelines
concerning job openings.

“We asked the president to
require department heads and
the personnel office to work
together in making sure that
when there is a job opening, the
opening should be made public
information to everyone at
Davidson.

“This should be done by
placing a written notice an-
nouncing the employment
opportunity on the designated
bulletin board in first floor
Chambers,” explained one sec-

, retary.

Spencer and Director of Per-
sonnel Robert Stephenson ap-
proved the Chambermaid’s
request and such procedures
concerning job posting are now
officeal personnel policies.

The Chambermaids’ action
was prompted in part by sev
eral past administrative actions
which involved offering em-
ployment to staff personnel
without previously posting
information concerning the job
vacancies.

Presently, the secretaries
have no manual or employment
handbook which they may con-
sult in order to gain information
concerning salaries, benefits,
job descriptions, requirements
for promotion, or qualifications
for’merit pay increases.

“As it now stands, we really
have no official statement con-
cerning the terms or conditions
of our employment.

“In addition to including
wage definitions in the hand-
book, it should also contain
information concerning job des-
criptions--so that’ responsibilit-
ies match pay scales.

“Some secretaries, clerks
and stenographers have more
responsibilities than others but
get paid less in wages,” re-
marked a secretary.

The Chambermaids re-
quested last spring that
Stephenson begin working on
compiling a handbook for all
hourly-paid staff members.

As of today, work on the
handbook has not begun.
Stephenson explains the delay:

“Because of a reduction in
secretarial personnel in this
office (personnel office), we
were unable to start on the
handbook as we would have
liked to have done.

“But I’ve’ talked to
Dr. Spencer and he’s agreed to
put some part-time assistance
in this office.”

Stephenson assured this re-
porter that work on the hand-
book would begin within the
next two months, or by
Monday, November 24, 1975.

In addition Stephenson
stated that the handbook would
be completed by the beginning
of Spring Term, or by March 8,
1976.

The Personnel Director also
remarked that the handbook
should include information con
cerning job descriptions, wage
scales and benefits.

Several secretaries agreed«
that the job categories are at
present “so confused and jum-
bled” that a complete

Watts engineers WDAV broadcast

By MARK GERGAN
~ Staff Writer

WDAV returned to the air
this fall with a new director,
Jack Golden, and in some
confusion over whether or not
the station would be able to
broadcast at all.

The difficulty arose from the
requirement that a 10 Watt
station must have a chief en-
gineer with a first or second

class license. Don Smith, who
graduated last year, previously
had been: chief engineer.

“The test to get a license is
pretty complex,” stated Gol-

den, “so we felt that it would be
better to go outside of our-
selves to get a new chief
engineer.”

Some difficulty was experi-
enced in finding an engineer,
and up until 5:00 the first night
of Freshman Orientation there

was no engineer. “Ed Stanton
of WHIP in Mooresville agreed
to do it for a week, so we were
able to go on the air. But this
would only have been until last
Saturday night”, added Golden.

“Finally Jeff Watts, who
works for WIST agreed to do it
for $1,000 for a nine month
period.” Golden went on to
comment that Watts duties
primarily consist of signing his
name to the broadcast sheet

and adjusting the transmitter
every two or three months.

“All we really need is his
name”, added Golden. The mo-
ney will come from appropria-
tions and would normally have
gone for new equipment.

Golden discovered that he
was the new director of WDAV
this summer, after he found out
that the previous director Mark
Wilensky would be unable to
continue in that position.

‘In a letter to the staff and the
Board of Directors, of the Sta-
tion, Wilensky stated that he
would be unable to resume his
position this fall because of
work in the Davidson Legal Aid
Society.

Golden stated,“Mark was
eareful in setting up the organi-
zation so it wouldn’t.depend on
one person, losing Mark makes
it hard, but the radio station
will get by.”

Changes planned for this
year are Omnibus, increased
news coverage, and hopefully
trying to get more community
listeners.

Omnibus is really a’ news
wrap up, with major campus
and community news from that
week, and mention of upcoming
events.
