to travel a whole day (not by train)
to get to his home after he reaches
Concord. Though this loyal son of
Hibernia has never been known to
study a lesson, he is the inventor
and perfecter of the Peanut Parch-
er, with which he has roasted all his
enemies—and all his friends. But
just the same he is a pretty decent
fellow. ;

THE SENIOR’S OWN

(Continued from page 5)
fertile soil isn’t the only kind of soil
that can produce fruits which ripen
in due season. He has won the
hearts of the students by his heavy
stick work on the baseball team,
having caused many college pitch-
ers’ averages to be lowered. It is
with much regret that we give him
up, but here’s hoping his old batting
eye won’t fail him as he plays the
great game of life.

Baso Profundo Sample

Gilbert’s principal vocation is
singing—morning, noon and night,
he keeps south wing Chambers in a
high state of excitement. On the
side line he manages to sell sweaters
—and anything else he can sell to
unsuspecting Freshmen. He has not
yet decided whether he will be a
surgeon or a salesman. But which-
ever one he does become, we predict
that he will soon be a rich man. He
has always been a success when it
comes to “gathering in the herbs.”

Sister Eddie Sanders

Miss Sanders is a profound stu-
dent and scholar of two times two
plus three minus six, which he says
is No. 1. He believes in having a
definite ambition. It is understood
that from the light gotten from
some of his mathematical discus-
sions, he is about to bring before
the world his entirely new system of
mathematics. Having had him wish-
ed off on to us by the class of '21, it
is with the utmost pleasure that we
wish him off on the world, with full
confidence in his ability to make his
mark in it.

Bessie Shields

What we are going to do for a
man to take “Bessie’s” place is a
most complex question. Bess has
been prime leader in the musical life
during his sojourn with us. As to
local talent he is unexcelled at Da-
vidson, when he performs on the
saxiphone large crowds soon gather
tc hear him. At the movies his skill
at the piano is the leading feature,
and when he is in Charlotte, Garver
Davis considers it a great asset to
have Bess join his orchestra. He is
a true son of Orpheus, and it is not
enough to say he will be missed
when he leaves us; but his going
away will mean a great loss to both
the students and to the college.

Miccellancous Siske

Manly Arphew Siske hails from
Beaufort. He lives up to his initials,
M. A.,, for he also got one of those
things this year. He used to room
with Pebble Stone, but is now get-
ting over it, I think. There has
been something radically wrong
with him, and it lasted till com-
mencement. He will go into the
rubber business this summer in Ak-
ron—after that, who can tell.

Lady Killer Smith

Red Smith, the lad from Missouri,
swung a northbound freight early in
September, 1916, arriving in the
metropolis of Davidson several days
later. Much to Red’s disappoint-
ment there was no street car to
bring him and his heavily loaded
suitcase to Chambers.

Red began his college career as a
Freshman of no mean reputation,
and, unlike so many, lived up to it.
If you want to know the area and
population of any city, town, village
or cross-road in either of the five
continents, see the young high
school professor-to-be. Red has
taught several days since entering
college. He is one of the few who
can make dates with girls while
showing them how to work Algebra
problems at the blackboard.

Red, during his college course, has
changed his address to The Hollow,
Va. He tells us that he has found
a young, beautiful light haired girl,
one whom he would never tire of
looking at. We hope that at the
Reunion in 1925 we will all get to
meet her.

Peanut Parcher Spence

This loyal son of the land of boggs
and of brogues is one of our most
distinguished noviates: he has en-
deavored to be different from the
rest of the world, and all the world
has helped him along by striving
with might and main to avoid being
considered a counterpart to this mad
March hare-who registers on the
college books from Concord and has

Red Sullivan

An engaging smile, an Irishman’s
greatest weapon, and a pompadour
that stands alone with a dash of
freckles and an inability to stop a
pig in a ditch and you have our Irish-
man, W. B. Sullivan. Red-headed,
of course, and noted for knocking a
baseball out of the lot and shooting
professors is a favorite pastime with
this Mick. Would that Davidson had
more Irish like him.

Pig Iron Sutton

Parham George Sutton, track
man, baseball player, grid-iron per-
former of repute, hails originally
and from time to time from the
humble little hamlet of Calypso, N.
C. He-is more commonly known as
“Pig Iron,” but of late has become
famous as “The President of the
Athletic Association.” His first ap-
earance in these classical shades of
earning was as a member of the
class of '19, but knowing that a wise
man changeth his mind, he later cast
his lot with ‘the class of ’'20. With-
out a doubt “Pig Iron” is the most
thought of man on the hill. Those
whose organs of audition are keen
invariably: have a gudden (Sutton)
thought every morning at 7:15. And
what is more, thoughts of him
iodi i in their ears
throughout the day. Calypso may
be justly proud of her famous son.

Fire Alarm Thomas

F, A. Thomas is the man who ran
one over on ’em by taking ten tick-
ets last fall. He did not show great
interest in the old dip until late in
his career, but we'll have to hand it
to the man who gets off ten tickets
in one term that he must be good
and must have lots of Pull. If he
can work folks that way from now
on, he ought to be president about
fifteen years before he’s old enough
to be constitutionally eligible.

M(usical) A(rtist) Tremain

Doubtless, dear reader, you have
noticed that the M. A. comes before
rather than after the name. Nor
does M. A. T. necessarily signify
that he is a great wrestler, but note
his record if you will, on four nights,
May 12-15: Martel the “boy wond-
er,” met and floored in succession
such famed artists on the mat as
Beethoven, the brawny German;
Bizet, the agile Frenchman ; Tschoi-
kowsky, the sinewy Russiag, and
Liszt, the incomparable Hungarian.
Yes, sirree, that lad from Wimincton
is going some. Wilmington should
be proud of him and Davidson is
truly grateful for the loan of him
for three years. And that reminds
us that it took this prodigy only
three years to floor every professor
on the “Hill” and win his A.B.

Goodbye, Martel, don’t stop here,
but win an M.A. to follow as well as
precede your name.

Al Wilson

Sergeant Alexander Love Wilson,
of Company A, is the social lion of
the campus. Blessed with good
looks and hair that will part in the
middle, he vamps ’em all. Every-
body likes him. If reports are true,
and he is all that he seems, we will
soon hear of the “Alligator Pear”
King of Florida, A. Love Wilson.
We are all with you, Al, and we'd
like to see you come back once in a

while.

Was a friend af all and loved by a

He studied hard and sat up at night

To see. how he might make work

This esteemed gentleman passed
only three years here at Davidson.
For this reason we are inclined to
‘forgive him for many of his faults,
which are’ several in number but
small of importance. Combined
with these excuses are his good
ualities, so we might say that he is
square with the world on that score.

An article might be written from

taller, and greater, in emotion and
sympathy and consciousness of
brotherhood.

Then followed a recognition of
the profound significance of co-op-
eration on a mighty scale, the na-
tion was fused together and there
sprang into being a consciousness
of the solidarity of our nation. In
turn there came the willigness to
sacrifice, to buy bonds, to have su-
garless days, wheatless days, meat-
less days. There came the camps,
the entraining, the ocean passage
for our boys and their campaigns in
France and America grew greater,
bigger, nobler minded for it. In
time the end came. Our great Pres-
ident went to Europe, the hope of
the world, the popular idol of all na-
tions. And then followed the slow,
creeping days during which dis-
graceful, infernal propaganda was
set in motion and we began to for-
get, to forget. A new mind seemed
to seize America, that other mind
out of which the war had raised us.
“Let the world perish, we will keep
our own.” ,

We have slipped back, far back,
as evidenced in the pessimism of the
returned soldiers declaring that
were another war upon us he would
not don the khaki but a pair of
overalls, as did thousands of others
a few years ago and draw his $8

iteer.

John D. Wiley, the fair-haired son
of Georgia, has in him all the neces-
sary characteristics for the realiza-
tion of his dream of becoming the
Tom Watson of the future. His
diabolical imagination carries him
into éxtravagances that are truly
amazing. , He has a line that flows
with the smoothness of the ai

he can’t impress you in that way,
he can surely knock you cold by

FRATERNITY RECEPTION
THE BEST YET.

Beneath the soft radiance of a
crescent moon the reception given
by the student organization was be-
gun under the most favorable aus-
pices. The band occupied a lighted
area near the center of the quad-
rangle formed by the fraternity halls
so that every one might enjoy its
music. But the crowning glory of
this affair was, of course, the ladies.
We know now why the poet said,
“A thing of beauty is a joy forever.”
And to judge from the looks and
actions of some they would like to
make these “joys” theirs forever.

of his class present. He told of hav-
ing been here so long that he had
taught grandfathers, fathers and
sons, that if he was spared good
health for another hundred years he
hoped to teach Greek to a crowd
that was more appreciative as the
classes get smaller each year.

Mr. Miller then proposed to the
alumni that they adopt a plan of
five-year subscription to The David-
sonian, and the Alumni Athletic As-
sociation. Mr. Price, of the class of
*15, moved that the plan be adopted.
After able presentation for the ath-
letic side of the joint program by
Mr. Miles, “Pete” Crayton, °15, Dr.
Douglass and J. M. Black, °18, and
for The Davidsonian by Carl Mat-
thews, '20, the association adopted
the plan and signed pledges at once
for the subscription of The David-
sonian and for the Athletic Associa-
tion for five years.

Election of officers for the new
year then took place. Mr. R. M.
Miller, of Charlotte, was re-elected
for the fifth term as president. Mr.
S. A. Robinson, of Gastonia, was
elected as vice-president, and Mr. F.
L. Jackson, of Davidson, secretary.

Dr. T. W. Lingle was re-elected to
the Board of Trustees, and Mr. R.

cancy caused by the death of one
of the trustees. The alumni are al-
lowed two members, and Mr. Miller

“What the root is to the tree, that
creed is to conduct.”

“True religion sometimes gets a
man into trouble, but it also gets
him out if he relies entirely on God.”

“Only faith, creed, and prayer like
Daniel’s can carry us through.”

“Life is the jailor, death, the angel
come to set us free.”

“Death is only a tunnel; a blaze
of light, the light of heaven, illumi-

The sermon made a-profound im-

new professors was necessarily
postponed.

The Bible Medal was then pre-
sented by Dr. Hammond to D. M.
Chalmers. The Senior Orator's
Medal was also won by Chalmers.
The President mentioned that if
there were a unit system for medals -
as well as for college activities,
“Dwight” would be ruled out, as he
has received in all nine medals and
a debating emblem. The Alumni As-
sociation Medal, awarded for the
highest mark in the Freshman class,
was presented to D. H. Ogden.

The honor roll was read and the
punctuality roll, upon which quite a
number of names appeared. The
President then spoke of the deep re-
gret that the college feels at the loss
of our honored and respected R. O.
T. C. commander, Capt. A. H. Muel-
ler. He also acknowledged with
thanks the generosity of the patrons
of the college in subscribing to the
needs of the institution.

D. M. Chalmers closed the exer-
cises by delivering the valedictory.
With ready wit and keen insight he
told of. the feelings of mingled joy
and sorrow with which he and his
classmates approached the time of
parting. He gave a glowing tribute
to the faculty and thanked them for
their labors in behalf of the class. He
then told of the future which loom-
ed up so bright before the college
and charged the succeeding classes
to live true to the high ideals for
which the college has been so long
noted. He closed with a few last
words of parting in which he bade
the college a touching farewell, and
urged his classmates to press for-
ward and onward toward even
greater and more magnificent suc-
cesses in after life.

The benediction was pronounced
by Dr. Hammond. Thus commence-
ment ended. The new era in the
lives of the departing students has
begun. _
