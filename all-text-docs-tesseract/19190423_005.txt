EVERY ALUMNI A SUBSCRI-
BER OF ‘THE DAVIDSONIAN,

There is nothing that draws — the
alumni and college together — better—
that portrays college life and spirit—that
stimulates “pep” and interest in athletics
and other college activities, than a good,
live college paper. “Phe Davidsonian is
such a paper. During its six years’ ex-
istence it has steadily grown, and some-
times against strong opposition, It. is not
satisfied to stop at this point, but great-

er effort than ever before shown, will

be exerted the year 1919-1920 to make
The Davidsonian rank among the best
of American college papers.

To place the Davidsonian among the
foremost college weeklies, it is necessary
to have the complete backing of the
Alumni, Students, Faculty and Friends.
Next year there will be a larger space
devoted to the Alumni Department. We
trust that every alumnus will co-oper-
ate with this department and help to
make it an interesting feature of the pa-
per.

We are beginning a subscription cam-
paign. Our goal is: “Every Davidson
alumnus a subscriber to the Davidso-
nian.” The business department is go-
ing to exercise every care to insure every
subscriber a paper every week. = ‘The
subscription rates will be the same as
this year, $1.25 for the collegiate year.
Remember, no skips, larger, brighter and
more brilliant than ever before. Do not
put off today what you can do tomorrow.
Send in your subscription now.

WHO WOULDN'T?

On Johnny's first day at school he
was given a registration card on which
his mother was to write his birth record.
The following day he arrived tardy and
without his registration slip.

“Johnny,” said the teacher, “you must
bring an excuse for being tardy, and
don’t forget the slip about when you
were born.”

All out of breath next day Johnny
rushed in holding a note from his moth-
er.
“Teacher,” he gasped, “I brought the
one about being tardy, but I forgot my
excuse for being born.”—Mother’s Mag-
azine.

A MIND READER,

Pat had got hurt—not much more
than a seratch, it is true, but his em-
ployer had visions of being compelled
to keep him for life, and had adopted
the wise course ot sending him at once
to the hospital. After the. house sur-
geon had examined him carefully, he
said to the nurse:

“As subcutancous abrasion is .not ob-
servible, Udo not think there is any rea-
son to apprehend tegumental cicatriati
of the wound.”

Then turning to the patient, he asked
quizzically :

“What do you think, Pat?”

“Sure, sir,” said Pat, “you're a won-
derful thought reader, You took the
very words out of my mouth, Vhat’s just
what | was going to say."—Current Lit-
erature,

SYSTEM MUST BE .RESPECFED.

A Chicago teacher pave a boy pupil
a question in compound proportions for
home work one evening, which problem
happened to include the circumstances of
“men working 10 hours a day to com-
plete a certain job.”

The next morning the unsuspecting
teacher, in looking over his pack of ex-
ercises, found one pupil’s problem unat-
tempted and the following note attach-
ed to the page:

“Deer Sir, PE refoose to let my sun
James do this sum you give him last
night as it looks to me like a slur on the
eight-hour sistem, enny sum not more
than cight hours he is welcum to do but
no more, Yrs. trooly,. Samucl Block-
sky.”

GOOD IDEA.

Jones was at the theatre, and behind
him‘sat a lady with a child on her lap
which was erying unceasingly.

Unable to stand it any longer, Jones
turned smilingly to the lady and asked,
“Has that infant of yours been christened
yet, mavam?”

“No, sir,” replied the lady.

“HET were you 1 would call it ‘Good
Idea,’ said Jones.

“And why ‘Good Idea’ ?” said the lady
indignantly.

“Because,” said Jones, “it should be
carried out.”

It was Jones who had to be carried
out,

NO ACCIDENT.

In a small West ‘Texas town out in
the Cap Rock section, interest was cen-
tered about the registration booth. A
cowman clicked up to the official in
charge and gave a well-known name.

“Ever have any accidents?”

“Accidents? Nope!”

“Never had an accident in your life?”

“Nope. Rattler bit me once,”

“Don't you call that an ‘acciden
continued the questioner, eyeing the casy-
going young fellow severely.

“No, The darn thing bit me on pur-
pose.”—Saturday Evening Post.

TOO SHORT A ‘TIME.

“Have you ‘Kissed Me in the Moon-
light'?” he asked the young lady behind
the counter. .

‘The young lady gave him a startled
look and replied: “It must have been
the girl at the other counter. I've only
been here a week.”

TOO EFFECTIVE
“The sermon you preached the other
Sunday on thrift had a great effect on
me,” said Griggs to the minister. “I
went out before the collection.” —Chris-
tian Register.
