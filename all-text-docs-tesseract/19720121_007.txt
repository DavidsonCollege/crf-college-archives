Second Best Freshman Team Vanishes

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

The 1968-69 edition of the
Wildcat freshman — basketball
team posted a 17-2 record, sec-
ond best in the history of the
school.

What has happened to the
players on that team since then
would make excellent material
for a oovel, or at least a soap
opera. Of the thirteen members
of that team, only one is now
on the varsity.

The squad included four schol-
arship men, who were billed
as the players ‘‘expected to
make Davidson basketball go
for the next four years” in 1948.

Bryan Adrian, Doug Hill, Eric
Minkin «nd Lester Strong were

the big guns, the best bets for
niches on the varsity. However,
a curious combination of events
has left Minkin as the only sur-
vivor.

Take the case of Doug Hill
for example. A two-time all-
State selection in Ohio as a high
school player, Hill was recruit-
ed as the man to fill the shoes
of graduating Dave Moser,
point man par excellence.

Hill performed quite capably
for the freshmen, hitting at an
11.0 clip and improving his de-
fence with each game. However,
he was disenchanted with Da-
vidson and ran into academic
difficulty. ;

His prospects for replacing
Moser were complicated by the
improvement of Ron Stelzer at

the point position, and Hill ap-
peared destined for a back-up
spot.

After one term of his sopho-
more year Hill transferred to
nearby Lenoir-Rhyne. A starter
most of last year for the Bears,
Hill was hit by injury trouble
and his playing time decreased.

Quite a comedown for the
lonely, intense Hill, who never
became the point man he was
groomed to be.

The career of Bryan Adrian
has left many questions unan-
swered and many hopes unful-
filled.

As a Wildkitten, Adrian set a
record for the highest average
in school history with a 28.7
mark. In the process he scored
30 or more points ten times.

Clearly, Adrian’s role was
that of a scorer. He eventually
became the point man his soph-
omore year, and had a super
season.

The injury jinx struck Adrian
prior to last season, and he was
not able to maneuver as well
as before. The knee is still a
big question mark as far as
Wildcat fans are concerned, but
he refused to comment about
its condition.

Lester Strong is another of
the scholarship players who is
absent from the team this year.

Strong demonstrated an im-

mense potential as a freshman,
averaging 10.9 points a game
and gathering in almost an
equal amount of rebounds.

Strong described his experi-
ence as a freshman player in
terms of illusions of grandeur.
“I felt that I had really hit the
big time here, and I was play-
ing regularly and contributing
to the team,” he stated.

He also remembers the times
of trying to study on bus trips
and falling alseep, and of sign-
ing autographs for the first
time.

After two seasons on the var-
sity in which he saw only spot
play, Strong decided to devote
his time to work in the admis-

‘Cats Whirl Past SC Teams

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

The past week has been one
vf relatively easy but import
ant wins for the Davidson cag
crs,

Tie Wildeats waded through
VMI last) Tuesday 73-57, and
easily trounced Richmond last
Saturday, improving their
Southern Conference record to
o2 to move into a tie for the
conferen’s loag with Furman.

But the casy part of — the
schecule appeers to be coming
to oan. end.

Tomorrow night the  cagers
meet West Virginia in Charlotte,
a team that beat Davidson on
the road two weeks ago.

At Morgantown, the ‘Cats led
by five with six minutes re
maining, and then hit a cold
streak that cost them the game.

The Richmond game played
here last week appeared to be
something of a party fer every-
one. Richmond offered little re
sistance to the Wildcats who
Whirled by the Spiders 112-80.

Everyone on the team got in
the game, with the last’ man

off the bench getting in over
cight minutes playing time. No
starter plaved more than 23
minutes.

VMI offered more resistance
in Lexington. The Keydets
threatened the ‘Cats’ lead sev
eral times during the game.

but Davidson finally walked
away with a 73-57 win.
Scoring was fairly evenly

spread in both games, and Joe
Sutter and John Falconi return
ed to their former marks after
slacs games against Pitt and
West Virginia.

The almost forgotten
men have been doing well in
their past few games, raising
their season record to 7 - 1.

The Wildkittens have won
their last seven straight games.
after an opening loss to Clem-
son, their latest being an 87-
67 win over VMI last Tuesday.

The team has scored over 100
points in four of their seven
wins.

Larry Horowitz, Greg Dunn
and Sheldon Parker have all
proved to be strong board and

men.

sions office and student-teaching
this year.

Eric Minkin turned out tc be
a pleasant surprise on the
freshman team, averaging 18.1
points a game and snagging a
school record 29 rebounds
against Furman.

Minkin was plagued by incon-
sistency his sophomore season,
and then had to shake off a hip
injury last year. He was not
really able to contribute much
until this year.

He has always seemed to per-
form at his best against tougher
opponents. During the fresh-
man season he humbled Paul
Coder of N. C. State and Tom
Riker of South Carolina, and
has turned in creditable games
against them since then.

Minkin’s attitude seems better
this year, and as the only sen-
ior he is assuming an added
role of leadership quite capab-
ly.

The other starter was non-
scholarship man Frank Clark,
who made up in hustle what he
lacked in muscle and talent. He
earned a spot on the varsity
his sophomore season but saw
sparse action.

The substitutes provide ample
material for anecdotes and in-
sights not offered by the start-
ers. Coach Holland noted that it
is really a mistake not to re-
cruit subs, or at least a certain
type of player who will sit pa-
tiently on the bench not know-
ing when he will be called upon.
It is a hard position to accept.

John Porter served as the top
guard substitute for Hill, and
he recalls that he was ‘‘surpris-
ed to make the team in the first
place.”

Gary Scibal was a_ reserve
forward, and he remembers the
freshman-varsity scrimmage in
which he had the unenviable
task of guarding Doug Cook.
The score was 99-44, and the
freshman had a long night. Sci-
bal was called for three quick
fouls, and needless to say, Cook
went wild.

Scibal also recounts the way
that the coaches would psyche
Minkin up before going into
games against every junior col-
lege with a threatening 6/5’
center.

He remembers playing against
Ed Leftwich of N. C. State, a

high school foe who had ‘Sky
King” written on his shoes.

Nicknames were abundant on
the squad, and most of them
were coined by reserve Tim
Groom, who played in five
games before leaving the team.

Clark was called ‘‘Stick’’, Hill
was ‘‘Monk”, guard Bill Barn-
hill became “Stump”, Greg
Sikes was ‘‘Lizard’’, Bob Peele
was simply ‘‘H”, Paul Nelson
was “Fox” aad Nick Livengood
was the infamous ‘‘Pear Body”.

Old subs never die; they just
go on to become stars in IMAC
basketball. Clark, Porter, Barn-
hill, Livengood, Scibal, Peele
and Sikes have all devoted their
energies to this sport, making
life miserable for those who
have played against them.

Another person connected with
the squad was manager Mike
O’Malley. ‘‘Big O” tells the story
of Peele betting Adrian that
Brian’s man would score at
least 18 points during the game,
only to find that Adrian would
be switched to another man at
halftime so that Peele could not
collect.

Holland’s assistants were Jer-
ry Conboy and Jim Hyder. Con-
boy was a Jekyll and Hyde type
of coach, who became a tiger
once the game began.

Hyder was _ nicknamed
“Whack” after the Georgia
Tech mentor, and was notorious
for showing up at practice
without a whistle.

He would resort to making a
“brrrrrpppp” sound with his
tongue and lips, but the high-
pitched noise would have little
effect on the players.

Perhaps Holland's funniest
moment occurred when he was
forced to start Livengood against
South Carolina because Clark
and Scibal were sick.

The Pear was understandably
nervous, and after missing sev
eral of his ‘‘flying pear” shots,
he held his man to 28 points.

So, the freshman team of four
years ago produced a record
which surprised the coaching
staff and many students. The
circumstances which have be-
fallen Adrian, Hill and Strong
could not have been anticipated
then.

At least it’s good to think
what might have been.
