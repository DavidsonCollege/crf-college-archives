Admissions prepares for the next millenium

Perspectives for 2001 visit campus; counselors prepare to accept class of 2000

Monday, February 19th, 259
high school juniors and their par-
ents visited Davidson to attend ses-
sions coordinated by Admissions
Counselors Max Hyde and Andy
Haile.

Kristi Kessler, Assistant Dean
of Admissions and Financial Aid,
says that admissions goals for
Monday’s sessions were twofold.
They hoped that the event would
not only present Davidson to the
students, but would also teach them
about the college search process in
general.

During the day, various mem-
bers of the Davidson college com-
munity presented different aspects
of the school and the admission
process to the students and their
parents through panel discussions.
“The day provided an opportunity
for students to learn about both
academic life and student life,”
says Kessler .

Monday marked the first time
that Davidson has hosted an event
designed to introduce high school
juniors to Davidson.

Kessler says that when ad-
mission counselors traveled to high
schools in the fall, they noticed
that most of the students who at-

tended information sessions about
Davidson were juniors. Deborah
Hogg, Assistant Dean of Admis-
sions, introduced the idea to de-
sign an event for juniors in Febru-
ary as they begin the college search
process,

Davidson is now one of the
few colleges with a junior visit
program. Kessler says, “the jun-
iors seemed excited about the day.
They seemed ready for the college
application process and came to
the sessions with good questions.”

Hyde felt that the event was
successful as well. “Our office
designed this program with the in-
tent of introducing high school jun-

iors and their parents to the college
search process. The phenomenal
attendance (over 600 people) indi-
cates the high demand for that
need.”

The admission staff is also
busy reading applications for the
class of 2000. The application
deadline was January 15th, and the
Admissions Office hopes to mail
acceptance letters to students on
March 15th,

There were 2,824 applications
to Davidson this year. Among that
number were 125 applications from
African-American: students, up
from 94 applications last year.

From March 15th to May Ist,

when students must respond back
to Davidson, the Admission Of-
fice plans for students to receive
weekly correspondence from the
Davidson College community.

The Admission Office will
arrange alumni receptions for ac-
cepted students in 20 cities across
the country, and accepted students
can visit Davidson again on an
individual basis during the month
of April.

_ Students nominated for schol-
arships or who have won scholar-
ships will be invited to campus
April 12th and 13th, and Decision
Davidson, forall accepted students,
will be April 14th.

Fine Arts

professors call for
more student talent

By Brap D. CHASE

The resounding sounds of
nearly 60 voices reverberate
through DCPC on a typical Tues-
day afternoon as the Davidson
College Concert choir prepares for
its four day jaunt to Florida over
Spring Break, and 55 students sit
through two rehearsals a week pre-
paring for the April 17 Davdison
Symphony Orchestra Concert.

Numerous other students par-
ticipate in voice lessons, ceaet
and band.

Davidson used to have a strong
tradition in the performing arts,
and many Fine Arts professors do
not see why more students today
are not participating.

Donna Di Grazia, director of
the Davidson Concert Choir and
Chamber Singers groups com-
mented that “I understand students
are busy and that there are a lot of
other interests at Davdison, but we
only have five tenors this year. I
know that there are more people
out there that can sing.”

The choir program was much
stronger until the last few years
when the choir began touring dur-
ing spring break, Di Grazia specu-
lated, “The Spring Break tours
caused participation to drop al-
most 50% because students wanted
‘to goother places for Spring Break,
and a choir trip was not a top prior-
ity, although [the trips] have al-
ways been fun and successful.”

To solve this possible prob-
lem, the choir program is now tour-
ing every other year and only for
four or five days of the apring
break.

Di Grazia is optimistic,
though, that the choir program is
slowly. gaining momentum. “I
don’t want to get too much too
soon. I want to get what we have
now established,” Di Graziaadded.

Richard Prior, Director of the
Davdison College Symphony Or-
chestra and Composer-in-Resi-
dence had a similar view on the

situation, “Things are adequate,
but they could be better.”

He is glad for what he has,

however. “It’s extraordinary that’

we even exist at this small of a
school. At Wake Forest and other
larger schools, they have far more
students but no orchestra,” Prior
added.

Prior also stressed that “the
orchestra is for everyone. I don’t

want people to be scared away |

because they think they aren’t good
enough. There is room in the or-
chestra for all different levels of
ability.”

Violation of this policy leaves

should an alcohol-related accident
happen at a Court party.

“Should something happen ...
our insurance,” for which Phi Delt
pays $7,000 yearly, “would be ab-
solutely no good,” said Cowan.

So high is the risk, Shandley
stated that of the 60 recommenda-
tions, this was “probably the easi-
est one [for self-study] to make,”
saying, “Kegs are antiques at other
places.”

The constant reference to the
ban of kegs at other schools leads
many students to question how
much of the recommendation arises
out of a sort of conformity to other
schools’ policies.

“Tt’s not so much ‘institutional
peer pressure’ as it is the fact that
students everywhere are respond-
ing because they’ re seeing the same
increases in insurance and legal
precedent ... and see the need to
respond to that,” says Beth Bell,
PCC advisor.

Kurt Holmes, Director of
RLO, cited concern for student
welfare as a motive for such a ban.
“Tt does not have to do with the
control of alcohol. It has to do with
keeping the Court safe,” said

keg ban is an indirect one, how-
ever.

“The fact that [alcohol] is so
accessible and that it’s free re-
moves personal responsibility to
make smart choices,” said Bell.
“Banning kegs won’t necessarily
make it safer for students. They’ Il
still have to make better personal
decisions,” she says.

Shandley, Holmes, Bell, and
Cowan all asserted that this is not
an attempt to eliminate alcohol.

Says Bell, “I don’t think it’s
[part of a] mission ... to make
Davidson alcohol-free. ... It’s to
make consumption more a per-
sonal choice.”

Beyond increasing “personal
choice,” the effects of a ban on
court life are unclear. “The major-
ity of campuses are BYOB,” says
Cowen, “but students have not quit
partying.”

Bell questions whether alco-

holconsumption willevendecrease —

on campus: “In the long run, it will
remain the same.”

Off the record, however, stu-
dents disagree.

“There probably won’t be as
much [alcohol],” said one frater-
nity leader. He is resigned to the

results, whatever they may be. “I
don’t think we have a choice. It
sucks, but it’s something that’s
going to happen.”

“As long as the houses pro-
vide some sort of alcohol, the so-
cial scene won’tchange that much,”
said one eating house leader. But
she cautions against the BYOB
plan that a keg ban would likely
lead to: “I personally think BYOB
will cause more problems than we
have now.”

She describes herself as “very
pro-court,” and “would hate to see
Davidson students leave on the
weekend, which could be a reper-
cussion of BYOB.”

Bell hopes that the PCC will
be able to prevent that. “[PCC lead-
ership] wants to protect a special
part of Davidson,” she says, refer-

ring to the court. She hopes that

any change to the alcohol policy
will come from the students. °

To do that, “the PCC will pre-
pare a plan for implementing
BYOB or recommend their own
plan to the CCRL,” she says, de-
scfibing its actions as “more
proactive than reactive.”

Despite the initial resistance
to a ban and BYOB, Cowan hopes

for a positive change in Court life.
“Let’s getaway from the mix- tape-
and-keg party,” he says.

He encourages “thought” in
planning parties, citing the Phi Delt
Airband and PiKA 70s-theme par-
ties as particularly successful al-
ternatives.

“T would encourage members
of the Davidson community to get
involved with the social life be-
cause they are the ones ... who can
shape [it],” he said.

Though the policy will not be
seen for months, Cowan stated,
“We’ re trying to devise a policy,”
so that if the ban is here when
students return in the fall, ‘“‘we’ll be

ready.”
