Volleyball
rolls against
SoCon rivals

By NATHAN BraDsHAW
Staff Writer

Before opening conference play, volleyball
was struggling along with 2-12 mark overall
as the young team struggled to find its chem-
istry. Since beginning SoCon competition,
however, volleyball has gone 7-3, including a
five match win streak. The Wildcats’ early trial
by fire schedule is now paying off, as they are
6-3 in the conference.

Jenna Dykstra ’07 explains,““We were defi-
nitely tried a lot as a team with our preseason
tournaments, and I think since then we’ve
grown a lot, even though we’re still four fresh-
men, four sophomores, a junior and a
senior... Now we know we can win [the close
games] because we’ve done it before.”

For example, the Wildcats showed that
mental toughness that Dykstra speaks of over
fall break against conference rivals Furman
and Wofford: Against the Paladins, after drop-
ping the first game, the "Cats came back in
game two to persevere through an impressive
.406 hitting percentage by the Paladins and
win 30-26. A flawless offense in game three
and a smothering defense in game four gave
the match to the Wildcats.

The next day, they finished out the five
match streak against Wofford, pulling out a
3-2 win against the tough SoCon opponent.
Dykstra racked up a triple double with 58 as-
sists, 10 kills, and 17 digs. Captain Tam Gallen
’05 led the defense with an impressive 39 digs,
while the team as a whole recorded 111.

The team’s win streak ended at Georgia

Volleyball has played well after
struggling early in the season.
Southern, however, where 14 service errors
put the ’Cats in a hole throughout the match
en route to an 0-3 loss.

The team then went to UNC-Greensboro on
Saturday and again win the close games, beat-

_ ing the Spartans in three games each decided

by no more than three points. On Sunday, how-
ever, the Wildcats fell to Elon 3-1 despite solid
defensive play for Davidson.

Says Dykstra, “I think our defense is at least
in the top five [of our conference], and that’s
our goal because of our smaller size. We want
to lead in digs and passing.” .

At Elon, Gallen and Lindsey Woeste ’08
each notched 17 digs, and Erin Balak ’06 had
15. On the offensive side, Liz Williamson ’07,
Balak, and Katie Pierucci 08 recorded 19, 18,
and 16 kills respectively. This balance over
the entire team, on both sides of the court, has
been the way of the Wildcat recently.

“We’re doing pretty well in the conference,”
Dykstra says, “[but] we just have to keep
working hard...and need to get some confi-
dence back.” ©

Early signs positive as swim
team opens year vs. Emory

The Davidson swimming and diving teams
put on an encouraging display in their season
opener against Emory on Saturday. Despite
the some great performances by the ’Cats,
however, Emory stole overall wins in the
women’s and men’s competitions.

The Wildcat women had a tally of 97.5
points to Emory’s 145.5. Sophomore Eli
Trefzger ’07 in particular had a very strong

- meet for Davidson, as she clocked a time of
10:32:21 in the 1000 yard free and 5:12.35 in
the 500 yard free to emerge first in both events.
In addition to this, Trefzger picked up a sec-
ond place finish in the 200 fly.

Other commendable performances in the
women’s team came from co-captain senior
Trisha Blackwell ’05, who captured first place
in the 200 back with a time of 2:09.71 and
Megan Perez ’05, who posted the day’s best
time in the 200 IM with a time of 2:15.23.
Meanwhile, freshman Kirsten Allen, ’08 swam
to a second place finish in-the 100 free, fol-
lowed by junior Kristen Shields ’06, who also
emerged second in the 50 free.

In the team competition, the” Cats won the
400 free relay with a team that consisted of
Shields, Jenny Hoekstra ’05, Brigit Barry ’07
and Leslie Sherril 08.

Said Trefzger on the team’s performance,
“T thought that the team did a great job com-
peting with Emory and they really were a co-
hesive unit.”

Meanwhile, the men tallied 85 points to
Emory’s 146. The bright spot was the fact that
they clocked top times in five individual
events and one relay. The performance of the
freshman class was particularly encouraging,

with William Broughton ’08 and Feite Stegger
°08 finishing first in two events each.
Broughton won the 1000 free with a time of
9:48.40 and the 500 free with a time of
4:50.31, while Stegger won the 200 free and
100 free with times of 1:45.34 and 48:27 re-
spectively.

Calvin Schildknecht ’07 also won the 200
breast with a time of 2:17.57 and the relay
team composed of Stegger, Jonathan Smith
’08, Charlie Raver ’06 and Brad Poole ’06 won
the 400 relay.

Said Schildknecht, “We put in a great ef-
fort considering how hard we have been train-
ing for the past four weeks. The team hopes
to move up into the top five teams at the con-
ference meet in February.” Head coach Tim
Kelly was also very impressed by the perfor-
mance of his teams. According to Kelly, “We
have had some great performances from all
our freshman to the senior classes. We com-
peted great and our perseverance in the pool
paid off on the last relays for both teams where
we were able to find ways to win. I am truly
proud of our team.”

Prior to the Saturday season opener, the
Davidson swimmers had an intersquad com-
petition between the Red and Black teams on
Friday night. There were some notable per-

formances at this meet as well, with the fresh-

man classes from both the men and women
sides coming in with a combined six top times.
_ According to Kelly, the meet was impor-
tant to foster team bonding. In his words, “The
good spirited competitiveness amongst team-
mates and the genuine excitement about see-
ing another teammate go fast is contagious and
great for the team.” The highlights were the
meet records set by Trefzger in the 100 Fly
and Broughton in the 500 free.

‘Cross Country teams gear up
for conference championship

Women runners tie Appa-
lachian State for first place
at Furman Invitational

By Pierce TRUMBO
Staff Writer

With the SoCon Championship just a week
and a half away, the men’s and women’s cross
country teams are now preparing for the
season’s all-important race on Oct. 30. Both
squads have made strides in recent meets.

The women traveled to Furman on Satur-
day, Oct. 9, where they faced a large contin-
gent of conference opponents and twenty
seven teams overall, and ended up tying for
first place along with conference rival Appa-
lachian State. It was a good confidence builder,
as Kelly Fillnow ’05 said that“besides con-
ference last year, this was the first time in
Davidson’s cross country history [that] we had
tied [or] beaten App. State.”

Fillnow again led the way with a time of
18:14,38, placing third overall. Ten seconds
behind her was teammate Brittany Crawford

-?08, who finished fourth overall with a time

of 18:24.44. Completing the rest of the

Davidson scorecard were Brenna Burns ’08'

(18:24.44, 13th), Anna Brew ’05 (19:23.98),
and Annie O’Donnell ’08 (19.33.87). Meghan
Fillnow ’05 (20:00) and Ashley Griffith ’05
(20:04) were the team’s sixth and seventh
place finishers.

As the last major meet before conference,
the women appear to be in good shape, as

Fillnow said that “despite some injuries and a
few minor setbacks, the race helped us refo-
cus our energy for the last two weeks of train-
ing in preparation for our goal of repeating
our SoCon title.”

The men also competed at Furman, where
Austin Mercadante ’06 led the ’Cats with a
place of twenty-seventh overall and a time of
27:01.50. He was followed by Jonathan Baker
06 (27:17.75, 45th), Nick Lehman ’05
(27:25.71, 51st), Sam Morris ’08 (27:26.38,
52nd), and Lee Wheless ’05 (27:26.84, 53rd).

For the men, a greater improvement was
made the following week on Friday, Oct. 15
when they competed at the Blue Ridge Open
at Appalachian State University. Of the ten
teams, the ’Cats finished fourth, which was a
strong performance and a marked improve-
ment in comparison to previous meets. -

Baker crossed the finish line first for the
team, placing 23rd overall with a time of 20:56
on the 6400 meter course. Mercadante clocked
in next in 27th place with a time of 21:09.
Lehman (21:11, 28th), Morris (21:34, 41st),
and Douglas Noreen ’07 (21:41, 45th) rounded
out Davidson’s scoring. Noreen, according to
Mercadante, “had a stellar race to break into
the top five of the team.”

With the effort in this race, the men appear
to have built some momentum heading into
the SoCon championships. Regarding the
team’s current state, Mercadante said, “All the
hay is in the barn. We just have to make sure
the barn doesn’t burn down in the next two
weeks.” ;

Both teams enter the postseason on Satur-
day Ocf. 30 at Furman University for the
Southern Conference Championships.
