Literary Societies

Metrophilian Society

The Metrophilian Literary Society rat-
ified the proposal of the Forensic Coun-
cil in regard to the personnel and elec-
tion of officers of the Forensiv Council
as the most important item of business.
Orations were delivered by three sen-
iors, W. M. Gracey, W. A. Patterson and
Thomas. Plans were made for a feed
for Tuesday night.

Eumanean Literary Society
The Eumanean Literary Society held
its regular meeting last Thursday night
in Eu Hall,

In the absence of the President, Vice-
President McCutcheon presided.

The query for the evening was “Re-
solved, that the United States should
establish a department of. aeronautics.”
Since some of the men who were sup-
posed to be on the program were absent,
two other men volunteered to take their
places.

The negative side composed of W. A.
Christian and Carter Rowe, won the de-
cision over the affirmative which was
supported by C. G. Davidson and J. M.
Murchison.

A. F. Burgiss gave a very interesting
declamation and the program was con-
cluded with an oration by W. W. Purdy
who chose for the subject of: his speech
“Habits.”

It was announced that the final meet-
ing of the society next Thursday night
will be a feed. It will be held at the
hotel and Dr. Arbuckle and Dr. Currie
will be the principal speakers.

J. M. Murchison.

Eu Society Banquet

As a fitting close for the past year’s
work the Eumanean Literary Society
will have a banquet at the Maxwell
Chambers Hotel Thursday night, May
14. The banquet will be at nine o’clock
and will take the place of the regular
meeting of the society.

At present plans are rapidly being
pushed forward for making the event
an elaborate affair and while it will be
informal there will be nothing lacking
sthat goes to make a banquet complete in
every detail. Besides the abundance of
eats and smokes that the members will
enjoy they will also be treated to two
talks by faculty members. Dr. H. B.
Arbuckle and Prof. A. Currie will make
short talks to the members of the soci-
ety.’ Tom Baker will act as toastmaster
and the seniors who are finishing their
work in the society will be called upon
for talks. Eight seniors are graduating
from the society and. this will be their
last meeting with the society. Incidently
it might be mentioned that this is the
first time that thefumanean Society has
ever held a fred outside of. its hall.

This year has been a profitable one
both to the society as a whole and to the
members individually. Improvements
have been made within the hall, the walls
have been calcimined, new pictures have
been placed on the. walls and the whole
interior appearance has been improved.

Besides these improvements the society

The Blue Ridge conference is essentially |
a religious conference, non-sectarian in na-|
ture. Clear presentations of the work of the |
church are made by forceful speakers, and!
the relation of the students to the church is |
discussed. World outlook classes conducted |
by leaders in their respective realms, and,
student discussion groups give opportunity
for expression of student thought on the
questions considered.

Mornings are devoted to discussion groups, |
world outlook classes, and lectures, with
open forum in both group and assembly
meetings. Afternoons are given over to
recreation.

sports. The-evenings are taken up with

The Davidson Freshman tennis team left
for Chapel Hill yesterday, where it will meet
the Carolina team this afternoon in the first
intercollegiate tennis mect that a Davidson
team -has. ever. entered. The Davidson team
has been playing consistently good tennis this
year, having easily defeated the Charlotte
Country Club and tied the Rock Hill’ boys.

As The Davidsonian goes to press it is not
definitely decided whether the Wildkittens
will play the Duke and Greensboro teams on
the return trip‘or not.

The men making the trip are: Dick Carr,

Bob Crosland, Jimmie Wharton and Malcolm
Lockhart. These are the four men that have
played in the other matches.

One question that always
arises in the mind of every
serious thinking college man
is, “What am I going to do
after graduation or during
vacation?” This is an im-
portant question, worthy of
serious consideration.

In a very definite way the
life insurance business offers
you the opportunity for suc-
cess. Inno field is there a
greater chance for the college
man.
