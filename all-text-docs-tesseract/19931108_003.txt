Despite rumors, none of the Doris Duke riches will benefit Davidson

By Mary Clare Jalonick

Rumors that part of the late
Doris Duke’s supposed $140 mil-
lion fortune would come to
Davidson have been proven false.

According to the Charlotte
Observer, when Doris Duke, once
known as “the richest girl in the
world,” died, no one knew exactly
where she would leave the money.

There was some speculation
that Duke would leave part of the
trust to Davidson College. The
Duke endowment, a separate trust
that totals up to $1.25 billion, has
been a large benefactor to the
school.

The Duke endowment gives
to Davidson annually along with

Duke University, Furman, and
Johnson C. Smith
College.
When
the will
wasfiledin
court Mon-
day, how-
ever, itwas
revealed
that she
will leave
the bulk of
her estate
to create
the Doris Duke Charitable Foun-
dation. The Duke Foundation
will rival that of the Rockefellers,
giving money annually to various

Doris Duke

organizations.

The only hindrance to Doris
Duke’s plan to use the money for
philanthropic purposes is her
adopted daughter, Charlene Gail
“Chandi” Heffner, whom she dis-
owned in 1991.

Heffner, who is a former belly
dancer and an avid Hare Krishna,
claims that she deserves a part of
the trust. Doris Duke adopted her in
1988, when Heffner was 35. In her
will, Duke said, “I am convinced
that I should not have adopted
Chandi Heffner. Ihave come to the
realization that her primary motive
was financial gain.”

Heffner, who now resides in
Hawaii onaranch that Duke bought

for her, is filing suit against the
trust for breach of contract.

Duke left other portions of her
trust to her closest friends, long
time employees, and the Metro-
politan Museum of Art in New
York. She left $10 million to Duke
University, and a week prior to her
death she donated $1 million tothe
school for AIDS research. She also
left $100,000 for her dog.

Duke also stated in her will
that she wanted Imelda Marcos,
wife of long time Philippine dicta-
tor Fernando Marcos, to repay her
$5 million loan. Duke posted bail
for Marcos when she was indicted
in New York for federal racketeer-
ing charges.

She inherited all of her money
from her father, James B. Duke.
Duke, who had made all of his
money from American Tobacco
Co. and Duke Power Co. , died in
1925 when she was 12 years-old.

The only way that Davidson
would get a portion of the trust
would be indirectly. According to
Kevin McCarthy, director of de-
velopment, the school will con-
tinue to profit from the Duke en-
dowment. -

Should part of Doris Duke’s
trust go to the endowment, then
Davidson could benefit.

Sig Ep's bring Eileen Stephens to speak about fraternity hazing

By Carrie Blackburn

Sigma Phi Epsilon’s speaker
on Wednesday evening, Mrs. Eileen

’ Stephens, relayed her own tragic
experience with hazing.

Her son Chuck, a sophomore
at Alfred University in New York,
died in 1978 after an initiation into
a fraternity ended with fatal conse-
quences.

For the first night of the Greek
system’s “Hell Week,” the pledges
were loaded three at a time into a
car trunk with a bottle of wine, a 6-
pack of beer, and a bottle of Jack
Daniels. They were told they could
not get out until they finished the
entire combination of alcohol.

When finally removed, the

pledges were all vomiting or un-
conscious. They were left to sleep

it off, but during the night Chuck
died, and two other students suf-
fered life-threatening injuries.
Remarkably, Mrs. Stephens is
“not anti-Greek, but anti-hazing.”

She has allowed the tragic inci-
dent with her son to inspire her to
bring about much needed changes
in hazing policies.

She founded the C.H.U.C.K.
Organization, Committee to Halt
Useless College Killings, which
has been instrumental in the pass-
ing of many of the anti-hazing
laws that now exist in 38 states.

Her message is simple but
thought-provoking: “I am not here
at Davidson because I want to
offend you, but I want you to
think.” —

Stephens admires the Greek
system because she has witnessed
their “energy, enthusiasm, and phi-
lanthropies” over the past 14 years;

however, she remains adamantly
against any practice of hazing.

“Nothing anyone can say can make
me think there is anything positive
about hazing.”

Mrs. Stephens’ sincere hope
is that the positive side of the Greek

concentrations offered in:

system will continue without the
degrading aspect of hazing.
She urged students to have "the

. vision, courage, and maturity to

say no and speak out." Davidson’s
own Student Handbook clearly
outlines the school’s anti-hazing
stance, which complies with
Stephen’s expectations.

The audience consisted prima-
rily of freshmen. She advised the
students: "It is my sincere hope that
each of you will leave here tonight
thinking very seriously about avery
serious topic."

Chapter 14, Article 9 of North
Carolina State Law defines hazing
as “to annoy any student by playing
abusive or ridiculous tricks upon
him, to frighten, scold, beat or ha-
rass him, or to subject him to per-
sonal indignity.”

The lecture was sponsored by
the Sig Ep house as part of their
chapter activities required after last
semester’s pledging violation. Last
February, Alfredo Urbino, then a
pledge, was injured during an at-

tempted “road trip.”

The college received a good
deal of negative coverage in the
local media as a result of the inci-
dent last year. Charlotte’s Chan-
nel 9 andthe Observer reports gave
hazing at Davidson a high profile.

In response to the situation,
the Dean of Students Office dis-
tributed “Pledge/New Member
Activity Guidelines” to all fresh-
men. Rule No. 11 onthe list stated,
“No pledge/new member activity
may involve hazing of any sort.
These prohibited activities include,
but are not limited to, physical
danger, alcohol and drugs, public
nudity, and mental anguish.”

The Dean’s review commit-

tee, comprised of two students,
Assistant Dean of Students anda

faculty representative, investigated
the incident and submitted find-
ings and recommendations to Dean
Terry and President Kuykendall.
Educational lectures and work-
shops on hazing were part of the
stipulations.

Effective December 1, the N.C.
Law pertaining to weapons on cam-
bus will read as follows:

It shall be a Class I felony to
possess or carry any type of fire-

rm, either openly or concealed, on
hool property.

Weapons on Campus

It shall be a misdemeanor for
any person to possess or Carry,
whether openly or concealed, any,
BB gun, air rifle, air pistol, Bowie
knife, dirk, dagger, slingshot,
switchblade, blackjack, and/or
brass knuckles.

Should
Belk dorm
be coed?

By Sally Stone

“Should first-year men and
women be housed only in single
sex buildings?” “Is it appropriate
to have men and women live on the
same floor of a building?”

These are some of the ques-
tions the Residence Life Office
has recently posed to the SGA con-
cerning sex designations in hous-
ing. .

Davidson’s housing tradition
maintains single sex dorms for
freshmen, while offering both coed
and single sex dorms for upper-
classmen. Recent discussions in
SGA _meet-
ings have in-
troduced the
notion of
coed fresh-
man dormi-
tories.

Argu-
ing that all
coed dorms
would
equalize
housing op-
tions for students and help interac-
tion between the sexes, the SGA is
soliciting student opinions on the
matter. Arguments against cam-
pus-wide coed dorms include the

loss of freshman hall unity and the
idea of integrating freshmen with
upperclassmen of the opposite sex.

As SGA senator Greg Fisher
stated, in order for coed freshman
dorms to even be considered by
RLO and the Dean of Students
Office, the SGA “really needs
strong student support. If students
are indifferent, it won’t happen.”

Richard Terry, Director of
Residence Life, agreed with
Fisher’s premise. If students feel
strongly that the residence halls
should have a different configura-
tion, “we need to know what stu-.
dents want,” he surmised.

The issue of coed freshman
halls does not end in the Residence
Life Office; it is an administrative
matter also.

As Terry noted, however, once
RLO is well aware of the student
consensus, they will try to comply
with student opinion. For now the
issue is left to the student body to
debate and vocalize.
