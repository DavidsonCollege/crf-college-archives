‘821 men: one cute co-ed’

By SALLY STEPHENSON
Guest Writer

I have no brothers, so it took a
little adjusting to get used to the
boys on the other half of Second
Belk my freshman year. They
smelled funny. Odors changed
from shampoo and perfume to dirty
socks and stale pizza as you
crossed the scent barrier and
moved toward their end of the hall,
but I loved living with them. Still,
there was an equal ratio of freshly
showered “Second Belk Babes” to
the flickerball champs, the
“Second Belk Stunnaz,” and we
could easily combat our hall-mates
with air freshener. However, 30
years ago, our teams would not
have been so evenly matched.

It was not until spring of 1972
that the Board of Trustees deemed
it time for Davidson to become co-
ed. There were to be no more than
100 women enrolled for the com-
ing academic year, and then 50
more could enroll each year until
there would be 500 girls in 1981-
82. For that first fall of 1972, only
one female freshman and 56 trans-
fers came.

This is not to say there were no
women at Davidson before 1972.

In fact, notes in the archives men-
tion the fairer sex’s attendance in
classes in the 1860s. The five
daughters of college President John
Kirkpatrick were enrolled in
response to the decreased number
of students during the Civil War.
Minutes from a faculty session
May 1896 announce that women
could attend classes at the discre-
tion of the faculty on a class-by-
class basis. Six women were grant-
ed permission during that month’s
meetings. One of those women was
Annie Brown, and she became the
first female to complete the
requirements for a degree from
Davidson. While the college recog-
nized her accomplishments when
she finished in 1901, she did not
receive an actual diploma. It would
not be until 72 years later that
Marianna “Missy” Woodward
would graduate with a degree in
June 1973.

In the early 20th century, women
could enroll under the “special stu-
dents” category that classified stu-
dents as “pre-medical, scientific,
divinity or women.” During this
time, the peak enrollment was 15
women in 1934-35. They were
expected to live off-campus and
were usually the daughters of fac-

worsen

ulty or prominent town members.
A 1952 issue of “The
Davidsonian” highlights Mary
McGill in the article “Enrollment:
821 Men - One Cute Co-ed.” The
sophomore took a full course load,
lived at home with her parents and
was engaged. She commented, “It
is quite flattering to be the only
female among more than 800
good-looking boys!”

So what was it like for the first
women after the Board’s decision?
For the most part, they felt wel-
comed.

“The students, both upperclass-
men and those in my class, the fac-
ulty and the administration, all
seemed happy, if not relieved that
we were there,” said Cathy Landis
Henschen ’78, the first female edi-
tor of “The Davidsonian”.

My mother, Emelia Stuart
Stephenson ’76, transferred in as a
sophomore in the fall of ’73. She
too was welcomed by the Davidson
boys and said the hardest part was
feeling the need to prove herself as
an academic equal. Especially as a
biology major, she didn’t want to
reinforce stereotypes that boys
were better at the sciences. It seems

A 1954 resolution condemning
segregation passed by the General
Assembly, the governing body of
the Presbyterian Church, began
Davidson College’s transition to a
racially integrated institution.

The Davidson trustees respond-
ed to the resolution by reaffirming
their commitment to an all white
Davidson. One report rejecting
integration states that “the admis-
sion of Negroes to Davidson
College would most certainly give
rise to...or otherwise encourage,
intermarriage between Negroes
and Whites” and that “unhappiness
and tension would result.”

Efforts by outspoken students
and faculty led to the eventual

Today, $1,521 is not enough to
cover a meal plan for the entire
year. In 1836, however, $1,521 was
ample payment for 469 acres of
good ol’ North Carolina land, cour-
tesy of William Lee Davidson II.
This purchase resulted in the
founding of a manual labor school
that is now known as our own
Davidson College.

In March of 1835, the Concord
Presbytery set forth to establish a
manual labor school in which
young men could be educated
while simultaneously earning a
hard day’s work. A committee was
sent to scout out, “a location with-
in fifteen miles of Beatties Ford on
the Eastern side of the Catawba
river” according to the minutes of
the Concord Presbytery meeting on
March 13th. With these plans set
into motion, one can imagine the
type of Louis and Clark spirit in the
air when the Presbytery re-con-
vened to purchase land and estab-
lish the manual labor school.

reversal of the trustees’ decision at
its February 1961 meeting.
Professors, notably Drs. William
Goodykoontz, George Abernethy
and Eugene Patterson, encouraged
students to question the College’s
segregationist policies during class
lectures. Although a poll conducted
in 1960 found that a majority of
students were opposed to integrat-
ing the College, several students
did voice support for integration
through The Davidsonian.

“We call their attention again to
this racial ban, for it is a moral bur-
den which will not be made lighter
by silence or neglect,” stated Ervin
S. Duggan ’61 in one such editori-
al. “It is a dehumanizing policy
which sets up color, not capability,
as the standard for admission to
Davidson...It is a policy which

Gen. William Lee Davidson Sr.,
for whom the college is named,
was a celebrated hero of the
Revolutionary War. The son of an
Irish immigrant, Gen. Davidson
quickly rose to prominence and
later joined the Continental Army
as tensions from the Revolutionary
War caused him to side with his
fellow Americans. Wounded sever-
al times during the war, Davidson
finally met his match in the 1781
battle at Cowan’s Ford, in which
his troops faced combat with
Cornwallis’ forces as they tried to
cross the Catawba River.
Davidson’s son, William Lee
Davidson II, was a part of the
founding committee for the school
and supplied land for the campus.
As a result, the college was named
after his father.

With 64 students, five areas of
study and three professors the man-
ual labor school opened in the fall
of 1837, naming Rev. Robert Hall
Morrison its first president.

flouts both logic and the Christian
ideals to which Davidson is com-
mitted....If we do not have the
courage to accomplish this [inte-
gration], the value of our education
is cast in doubt and our Christianity
exposed a mockery.”

.Duggan was later reproved for
language that was “disrespectful to
his elders” in the article.

Integration at Wake Forest and
Emory Universities also encour-
aged change at Davidson. A fall
1961 Davidsonian editorial states
that Davidson “lag[s] behind our
sister institutions to the north and
south — both in advances in elimi-
nating racial segregation and preju-
dice and in campus discussion and
action. We are ashamed that
