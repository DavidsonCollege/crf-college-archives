Welcome Home

Welcome back, Dr. Spencer! Y

You’ve been missed the past couple of months,
and regretably some hot tempers have boiled which
need some cooling information.

Perhaps your hottest problem will be dealing
with the controversy over the recent administrative
shuffle.

Some faculty were understandably disturbed at
what they felt was an unjustified lack of opportunity
to participate in the decisions.

Students generally approve of the newly-
appointed dean of students, but deeply resent having
had little part in the selection. Such a move not only
hurts your relationship with students but also ham-
pers the new dean.’

Another problem you must deal with is the
fraternity situation. The report of the Committee of
18 deserves your endorsement and active support.

‘The effects of this year’s rush must be dealt with

firmly for the best interests of all concerned.

In your absence, restless freshmen have amass-
ed impressive arsenals of fireworks and have offered
almost nightly pyrotechnic displays despite illegali-
ties and the disturbance. of those who had other
auditory desires.

Like State, Georgia, Army,

In spite of heart-breaking

lost their desire to win, dis-

their ability — ‘Modern Men
of La Mancha," they might
appropriately be called.

‘No doubt about it, these

Three Blind Mice

Seasoned observers of Davidson’s social scene
find it hard to believe that 110 freshmen were sucked
into the dying exclusivity of the old fraternity sys-
tem. One wonders which was greater, the salesman-
ship of the four participating fraternities or the
gullibility of their victims.

In light of the report of the Committee of 18 it
made less sense: to accept bids than it did to offer
them. The report says specifically that over the
Christmas vacation each freshman will be randomly
assigned to one of the twelve houses to receive two
measly weekly meals and full social benefits.

Pledges have no guarantee of assignment to the
fraternities they have affiliated with.

As for the four fraternities involved, what they
did to the rushees was at worst dishonest and at bes
short-sighted.

Finally, recommendations specifically relating to
this year’s rush should have been issued by the com-

mittee of 18 for the benefit of the fraternities and °

the protection of the freshmen.

Despite this three-way bungle, a viable social
pattern seems -close at hand. The responsibility for
success rests with all of us. Let us strive to make the
transition. :

Clearing The Air

The Committee on Campus Governance was
created last spring by the Board of Trustees and
given the responsibility of clarifying the nature of
authority dnd responsibility in the organization of
campus affairs.

Unfortunately, committee action to date has been
sparse.

We have reached a point where the college sys-
tem of “governance,” particularly the judiciary, has

_come under serious fire, to the point where commun-

&

ity respect for it is at what must be an all-time low.
Given the importance of their task, THE DAVID-

‘SONIAN urges that the Committee on Campus
Governance proceed ..as- quickly —as--possible-in.the

fulfillment of its mission and that it inform the stu-
dent body soon of the role which it will be required
to play in the approval of the reforms recommended.

Something Of Value

Having ‘led a sheltered life,
it was only last weekend
that I encountered Youth
Culture: in Charlotte, of all
places.

It was a cut-rate showing
of 2001, and all the ‘kids’
were there.

They were not impressive.
The quality of conduct exhi-
bited was similar to that of
the cohorts of my unlettered
youth, rather than a cultur-
al avant guard.

The ‘‘kids’’ were little
more than a herd when I
encountered them. The con-
tinual interruption of a rath-
er complex film by childish

outbursts was only quieted |

by a scene near the end
which involved an. impres-
sive display .of colors.

One: poor specimen con-
tinually emitted a _high-
pitched, moronic laugh,
obviously prompted by a sti-
mulus more powerful than
the-film. All attempts to

quiet him were met with the

dazed response that he ‘‘just
couldn’t stop laughing:

It is, of course, unfair to
few individuals

through external appearance
and draw _ generalizations
about a whole generation
from this typecast group.

The trappings of a coun-
terculture do not necessarily
indicate an understanding of
its substance (provided, of
course, ‘the substance ex-
ists.) :

Yet the point remains that
great numbers of America’s
youth have chosen a new
lifestyle, the basis. of which
isa rejection of society’s
traditional mores in favor of
a personal way of life.

And so what was once the
way of life of a minute pro-
portion of our society, usual:
ly artistically inclined, has
been adopted by.a mass.

Creation of a new lifestyle
hs usually implied a know-
ledge of what life ought to
be which differed from that
of society at large.

The proliferation of this
style, which now makes it
the in" thing to rebel a-
gainst..society,-has—-resulted
in a rejection of conventional
morality without anything of
substance to put in its place.

SMITH
The result of this develop-

ment is that the _ evils
against which part of. the
thrust of Youth Culture is
directed have been trans-
ferred ‘to the counterculture
itself.

Maybe my response to the
situation in question is, as
noted above, the result of
a sheltered life.

Be that as-it may, the con-
clusion is unavoidable that
the old problems of insensit-
ivity, unconcern for the
rights of others, lack ° of

identity, and loss of meaning

in life are still with us, dress-
ed in different clothes.

We have only new forms of
difficulty, not new men.

(Merry Christmas.
