Coach Tom Oddo’s ten plus years
of being associated with the pro-
gram.

On Saturday, the Wildcats
were at Washington & Lee for an
8-team tournament. Sam Knowles
(158) and Robbie Fierro(126) both

cludes nine pins. Miller has the
second best record on the team at
13-7.

Next up for the Wildcats is the
Mid-South Tournament held at
Carson Newman in Jefferson City,
TN. “

“This is one of our more diffi-
cult tournaments of the year,” said
Oddo, “but as well as we’ve been
wrestling I would expect usto have
atleast three or four wrestlers place
in the meet.”

felt in the southeast.

Narat’s leadership and impor-
tance to this team was no where
more evidenced than in the game
versus UTC when the Wildcats did
little more than watch the game
during the first half.

Narat kept his team in the game
with twelve points in that half,
doubling the effort of any team-
mate,

McKillop hopes that Narat will
continue to prove to be an excel-
lent role model, but not just during

their games after that. If that hap-
pens, our current class of sopho-
mores could be a class of Janko's
by the time they are seniors.”

If the designated go to man at
game’s end can continue that im-
provement, then Narat’s chances
of playing professionally seem
quite good.

According to McKillgp, “I
think that Janko will definitely play
somewhere at the next level. He
has to improve his athleticism and

diversify his game a little more,
but with his passion, I know he will
commit himself to doing that.”

But what happened at the end —
of the win over UTC with Alpert
hitting that important shot raises
the question of whether clutch per-
former status is being passed to the
younger player.

Alpert, however, puts such
‘speculation quickly to rest. “Janko
is still our go to guy.”
