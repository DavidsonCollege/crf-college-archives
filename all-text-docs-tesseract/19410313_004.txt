Sports Take Over

INTRAMURAL DOPE—

With the completion of football, basketball, and bowling, we
find the Phi Delts in the lead in the interfrat race with a total of
402 points. 158 of these were acquired in football, 132 in bas-
ketball, and'112 in bowling.

In second place are the Kappa
first place, in football and bowling,
Grouped close behind are the SPE’s and Phi Gams,
points apiece. : ie

Some fifty points back are the Pi Kapps, Ka’s, and 5. A. 1S)S;
the former two with 277 points the latter with 274. The Pi
Kapps were awarded 100 points for taking: undisputed first
place in the basketball race. ‘The Pikas are in last place with
a total of 237.2.

AROUND THE MAJORS

In the spring a young man’s fancy turns to thoughts of love
and, if he’s a typical American, to baseball. The national pas-
time as played by the big boys attracts our attention at this
particular time and_so_let’s take a gander atthe American and
National League races and see how things shape up. :

As a special concession to some of our uneducated friends
from the mid-west, we'll take the National League first, if for
no other reason'than to get it off our minds. It looks like an-
other Red year, because what can a man do about Bucky Wal-
ters and Paul Derringer? Without them the Redlegs are just a
fair country ball team; with them, World Champions. But they
are not without them, so why waste time?

Opposition, if any, should come from the Department of Dat-
finess, alias the Brooklyn Dodgers, and, of all people, the Bos-
ton Bees. The Dodgers are a screwball lot but at the same time
are a very dangerous club at the bat, with power aplenty per-
sonified by “Muscles” Medwick, who is due tora great year.

The Bees are a young ball club and may crack under the
pressure the experts are putting on them by ordaining them to
such-lofty perches, Chet Ross-and Max West supply punch’ so
rare in the older circuit teams. If these kids don’t get the jitters
and fall apart at the seams, watch out.

The Pirates, Cubs, and Cardinals appear so loaded with ‘ifs,’
that it would be a bold heart indeed that selected them for a

, spot any higher than fourth, The Corsairs have a truly fine
ball club, but are faced with a shortage of pitchers. Jimmy Wil-
son must handle his prima donna rookic, Lou Nivikoff, with
kid gloves, or he’s liable to split the club wide open, Out in St.
Louis, rookie pitchers are being herded around like cattle so
plentiful are they, but can’t more than one ot them pitch ata
time. :

As for the New York Giants, we wish there were a spot be-
low the celler we could reserve for them, but we believe they
will edge out the woeful Phillies. The Phils are, as usual, the
most powerful team in the National League; they hold up the

other seven.

Over in the junior circuit, to get back to more pleasant
things, it appears-the Yanks are on the loose again. Addition
of Gerry Priddy and Phil Rizzuto, the sensational kid second
base combination, should Jend punch whieh Frankie Crosetti
could do little toward supplying. A few good rookie pitchers
also make the scene appear more rosy in the Bron,

The Cleveland Indians, undoubtedly the best team in base-
ball, lack that little part of the anatomy known as intestinal
fortitude. Teams that don’t possess this valuable treasure
don’t win pennants, Fellers or no Fellers. The boys from up
Beantown way, the Red Sox, still have the devastating power
at the plate, but their pitchers (?) just can’t get the other
side out.

We don’t know exactly why, but we think the St. Louis
Browns are going to crash the first division. No particular
reason, we just think so. Jimmy Dykes’ White Sox may
surprise and raise plenty of hail Columbia, because Jimmy has
a way with his chattle that makes them win ball games,

Strange to pick a pennant winner for sixth place, but we
can see no better fate for the Detroit Tigers and their “Four
Old Men” in the infield. The prospect of Hank Greenberg
wielding a rifle instead of a mighty bludgeon doesn’t help
matters any.

The Athletics and Senators should have a jolly time of it
trying to stay out of the cellers, Would that there were two
cellers, so that Washington could finish in both of them.
