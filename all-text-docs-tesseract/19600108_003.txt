WITH THE long-delayed 1-F Swimming Meet safely
out of the way, Davidson's most popular intramural sport,
basketball, will swing into play next week. THE DAVID-
SONIAN, realizing that a four - game evening slate often
draws more spectators to Johnston gym than a varsity
clash, decided to publish a pre-season rundown of the
participants. Information on each team was provided by
the sports managers.

The only significant rules change this year is the
ineligibility of sophomores who won a numeral on the
Freshman team last year. The new ruling will affect four
fraternities and keep six boys out of action this year.

In alphabetical order, here is the line up for 1960:

ATO—will have to hustle to improve on last year's
§-6 record and sixth place finish. Graduation of Spence
Mitchum and Ed Lewis cost in backboard strength and
shooting. Top rebounder Charlie Benson may be lost
also fond Bili Whitesell and Jim Owens will have to carry
the load.

Beta—finished fourth with a 6-6 record .. . have
about the same team back, plus Richmond Rucker, re-
turned from a European junket. The Betas still need a
big man who can score to take pressure off All-star cap-
tain Fred Lane. Billy Davis, Jim Hamilton also Freshman
Carl Hunt may help some.

KA—Hight Redman, a fugitive from the varsity,
may boost the KA's into title contention. With only two
losses by graduation last year, the KA’s will field a
veteran starting five including Dee ‘Green, Julian Pleas-
ants, Redmond, Gene Whitton, and Bill Gayle. Should
improve on their fourth place finish.

KAPPA SIG—The Kappa Sigs will be playing with-
out ace scorer and rebounder Curlie MacQueen. Duncan
Morton, Sammy Jackson, and Bob Cook return to take
up the slack .. . may not be as strong as last year but
should improve as season progresses. May get some
freshman help.

PHI DELT—as usual, a contender. Loss of Angus
McBride .and Ben Harris may hurt, but top scorer and
rebounder Bob Denham, 6-6 John Packer and perhaps
the lIeague’s best backcourt brace, Freddy Pharr and
Bob Davis return. Freshman Alec Gibbs may be the dif-
ference in a tight race for the title this year.

PHI GAM—entire lineup returns to give the Fijis
the most experienced team in the league . . . big Lou
Zirkle, Tom Ridenhour, Bob Thompson, Charlie Patter-
son, Bob McAllister and good bench make them the dark
horse favorite again. Were co-champs last year with the
Phi Delts and SAE’s.

__ PIKAS—may improve on last year’s 2-10 record but
still sorely need board strengtgh. Nick Ivanoff, Jim
Fouche, Waller Neal, Waiter Pharr return and may get
freshman help.

PI KAPP—Quinton Boyd returns to lead the Pi
Kapps, who will have to get along without Dee Lide this
year. Jim Pressly, Jerone Herring and Big Dave Nash
return also . . . with luck, may equal last year’s 6-6
recor

SAE—lost only one starter. The SAE’s will be the
fastest team in the league and may successfully defend
their co-championship. Lee Cory, Hank Pharr, Doug Orr,
Pete Wyrick, Charlie Rowe, Ed Hines, and Phil Patrick
return to man a strong, smooth-running outfit.

SIGMA CHi—just about the same team that finish-
ed fifth last year. Weasel Killian, still the best ball hand-
ler in the league, pairs with Bill Brenner in the back-
court .. . George Hart, Harry Cline and Finley Holmes
up front... may get help from freshman Pau! Watson.

SIGMA NU—didn’t win a game last year, but with
much more experience, should improve. Bill Kirkland,
Art Toole and Lewis Parker are the best returnees...
freshmen Alexander Teass and Bob Miller may help the
cause.

SPE—another up-hill battle . . . four starters return:
Dan Clemmer, Mike Maddox, Melvin McKenzie and Andy
Allen. Sig Eps still are short of height, a consistent
scorer.

THE INDEPENDENTS—always an unknown quali-

ty—their success usually depends on how many ball

layers go inactive. Returning are Tee Redding, a fine
all player, and Old Reliable, Bill Terrill. ,

for the ‘Cats, who sent the
Gamecocks reeling to their
third straight defeat. But the
South Carolina frosh took the
opening meet from the Wild-
kittens, 21-15.

Other winners for the David-
son varsity were John Scott,
Tom French, Stephan Young,
and Bob McDonald.

For the meet, Coach Shoe
sported a new diver, Jack
Rose, who sat out the first
four contests after porform-
ing superbly last season.

Rose, along with Jennings
Snider, should provide David-
son a terrific one-two punch
on the plank.

Coach Shoe’s tank crew left
for the holidays with successive
victories over Virginia and Wil-
liam and Mary.

“We could have beaten them
worse,” the Davidson coach said
about W&M. Final score was
60-37.

The Virginia meet, won by
the Wildcats, 55-42, was a
‘different story. Davidson
dropped four of the first six
‘events. It took two wins each
by Tom Hudgins and Barry

V.M.I. was the Wildcats’ lone

stumbling block, 51-39. In that

meet, explained Coach Shoe,
“our morale went to pot.” As
Davidson led by two points go-
ing into the backstroke, the
mect official fired his pistol
too soon in the event, costing
the Wildcats several points.

“We weren't the same after
that,” Shoe said.

But as the Christmas holi-
days drew near, the Wildcats
were in wonderful shape.

“We were within three sec-
onds of every team record at
that time — which is pretty
good,” commented the coach.

None of his swimmers are
undefeated this season, but
Branch, a sophomore, has been
beaten only by V.MI. in the
200-yd. individual medley. He
should break some records in
coming wecks.

“Tom Hudgins,” said Shoe,
‘will be one of the better
swimmers in the conference
this year. He's really work-
ing.”

- Next meet for the Wildcats is
a week from tomorrow with
VPI.

State Matmen
Hit Davidson

The Wildcat grapplers

met N. C. State in Raleigh

this afternoon in an attempt to get on the happy side
of the won-loss column. Davidson record is 0-2.

‘Pfeiffer on Tuesday and The
Citadel on Thursday round out
before Exam activity.

Two Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence squads, Duke and North
Carolina, dropped the 'Cats in
pre-holiday matches.

Despite the fact that two
regulars, Milton Gee ahd Jim
Allen, were, out of the lineup,
the Cats turned in a stellar
penfarmance against Carolina.
on the 17th of December be-.
fore bowing 16-14 in a real
squeaker.

It was a case of Carolina and
Fate versus the Wildcats.

With Carolina leading 16-1
Alex Porter took the mat in the
heavy-weight division. Porter
pushed his man all over the
court, trying desperately for
the pin and the five points that
would tie the match at sixteen
all. ,

Porter finally succeeded in
pinning his man, but two sec-
onds too late. When the final
gong sounded, Porter had his
opponent’s shoulders a bare
three inches from the mat and
about two hundred disappoint-
ed Davidsonians sank back in
their seats with a groan.

Davidson's cause got off on
the wrong foot as lack of a
competitor in the 123 pound

class resulted in a forfeit to the
Tarheels.

The State match was sup-
posed to have been a rough one
for the Cats. State has the
same team that drubbed David-
son fast. year.

“They have good men in the
weights where we are not so
strong,” said chief mat mentor,
Charlie Parker.

Allen and Gee were’ not ex-
pected to wrestle in this after-
noon’s match.

On Tuesday, Davidson re-
turns home to meet: the visi-
tors from Pfeiffer. The Cats
split with the Panthers in two
contests last year.

Gee will probably be in the
lineup against Pfeiffer.

Davidson should be at full
steam against The Citadel on
Thursday with the return of
Allen, who has been out with
a bum shoulder. Allen wrestles
at 167.

The Citadel boasts a rugged
squad that has already dump-
ed Carolina 23-8 this yéar.

Coach Parker, however, was
still inclined to be optimistic.
“With Allen and Gee both back
in the lineup we may give them
a good match.”

The contest will be held in
Charleston.

Four Wildcats Named
To All-South Team

Four Davidson Soccer players were selected on the
All-South team last month. Claude Finney, team captain
for 1960, Mike Laughlin, Tom Price, and Dick Dalton
were voted to the honor squad, which covers 35 teams
ranging from Maryland down to Florida.

The honor men were voted on by referees and
coaches after each game. The votes were tabulated at
the end of the season. Five players were selected for
each position, making up five separate teams. Players
selected on the Southern first team are usually designat-
ed on some All-American team.

Finney was selected fourth team goalie for the third
year in a row. The remaining three Davidson players
were fifth team selections. Mike Laughlin beat out a
UNC star who was a third team selection last year at
center forward. Price was selected at left wing while
Dick Dalton was tabbed for Jest fullback. This was Dal-
ton’s first year playing soccer.

Most of the first and second team selections were
from soccer powers Maryland and Navy, Johns Hopkins
and Baltimore University. Davidson placed more players
on the All-South squad than any school below Maryland
except Lynchburg College. Duke had two men and UNC
placed three men on the honor squad.

Coach Paul Marrotte announced that a two-week

“spring practice” for soccer would be held sometime in|

February.
