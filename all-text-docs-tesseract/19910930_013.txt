Volleyball Downs Wingate College g

By Bruce Balestier

Having faced acritical pointin
its season after a pair of unsettling
losses to Charleston Southern and
College of Charleston last week,
the Davidson Volleyball team, ap-
parently has righted itself, if Tues-
day’s 15-9, 15-1, 15-12 win over
Wingate is any indication.

Mental problems, namely. a
lack of concentration and inten-
sity{ had hampered the Wildcats
during their brief, three-game los-
ing streak; that lack of focus had
translated into uncharacteristically
error-filled performances. So it was
Coach Rebecca Hawkins’ main
aspiration that her players regain
their mental form and commit
fewer errors.

She got her wish, for while the
still-struggling attack was “not

glorious,” in Hawkins’ estimation,
the intensity and effort were there.
The win over Wingate was com-
forting, a swift decision over an
inferior opponent. Hawkins said,
“That’s what we wentthere to do.”
The victory raised Davidson’s
record to 8-5.

Unfortunately, time for reflec-
tion is noticeably absent in this
season of frequent challenges for
the team, and perhaps the foremost
of those challenges came in this
weekend’s trip to the James Madi-
son Tournament in Harrisonburg,
Va. There, the ‘Cats faced host
JMU, Delaware and East Tennes-
see State, and entered as under-
dogs in all three matches.

In the opener against James
Madison, the Dukes simply proved
to be too much to handle, easily

dispatching of the Wildcats in three
consecutive games, 15-7, 15-9, 15-
10. But Hawkins got her upset in
Saturday’s matchup with Dela-
ware. Davidson downed the Blue
Hens in four tough games, 15-9,
15-10, 13-15, 15-10, recording a
meaningful win for the program.

In the tournament finale, the ‘Cats ~

fell to East Tennessee State of the
Southern Conference, 15-9, 15-6,
15-9. .

The Big South schedule now
begins in earnest for the team.
Davidson visits conference oppo-
nents Winthrop and Liberty this
week, in addition to non-confer-
ence foe UNC-Greensboro. The
Wildcats return to Belk Arena af-
ter a month-long absence when
they host UNC-Ashevilleon Thurs-
day, October 10 at 7 p.m.

Football Falls in Second Half Rout

By Bruce Balestier

Afterenjoyinga 14-13 halftime
lead over homestanding Emory and
Henry Saturday afternoon, the day
turned dark for the Davidson foot-
ball team, as the Wasps scored 26
unanswered second half points to
run away with a 39-14 win. The
loss dropped the Wildcats to 1-3.

In what is becoming a familiar
theme, freshman. fullback’ Bruce”
Bannister was the star in the first
half, rushing for both Davidson
scores. His l-yard run gave the

Wildcats a 7-0 first quarter lead,
and his 81-yard sprint late in the
second period pat the ‘Cats on top

14-7,

But the Wasps closed to within
a point with a touchdown just 31
seconds before the half, marked
their place, and began the rout on
their first possesion of the second
half.-In all, Emory, and Henry
gainéd 440 yards rushing atid 582:

The Wildcats received 121

fumbles, but simply lost to a supe-

After the game, Davidson Head
Coach Dave Fagg offered no ex-
cuses. “I hope we don’t play any
teams better than that,” he said.
“They absolutely mauled us.”

Field Hockey Defeats
Pteiffer College 5 to 1

By Jennifer Roos

Perhaps thinking of the KA t-
shirts that read, “You never forget
your first time,” the field hockey
team experienced a plethora of
firsts Sept. 18. Ina 5-1 win against
Pfeiffer College, four players,
Suzanne Hardesty, Robin Pepper,
Monique Dockter and Jennifer
Roos, scored their first goals of the
season.

Sophomore Suzanne Hardesty,
who scored her first collegiate goal
early in the second half, reflected
on it after the game. “It was a long
wait,” she said, “and I was so ex-
cited that I wanted to go to Walt
Disney World afterwards.”

Dockter, a junior, said that “it
was nice because the team pro-
duced goals throughout the entire
game instead of slowing down
offensively.” ©

Newcomer Robin Pepper said,
“T was very psyched. It was unex-
pected because I thought she [the
goalie] deflected the ball out of
bounds.”

Pfeiffer capitalized on
Davidson’s sluggish early play to
score off a first-half deflection.

The goal was one of just five Pfeif-..
fer offensi:e threats during the ©

game, and stirred some contro-
versy. “We pulled the defense up

‘in order to get an offside call, but

the official completely missed the
call;” defender Erin Lang said.
After Pfeiffer’s goal, the Wild-
cats dominated the game by main-
taining possession of the ball within
Pfeiffer’s twenty-five yard line

until halftime.

Davidson tied the game 1-1
when Roos scored off a corner
play, her first goal of the season.
The offensive line kept the mo-
mentum up in the second half with
a strong passing game before the
scoring deluge began. Roos scored
again and was quickly followed by
Hardesty, Dockter and Pepper. The
5-1 victory brought Davidson’s
record to 2-0 in the Deep South
Conference and 3-1 overall.

The Wildcats next met James
Madison of the Colonial Confer-
ence. The team’s goal has been
targeted as a possession game with
strong, accurate passing on turf
and grass fields. Davidson hung
with JMU throughout the first half
until the last thirty seconds. The
Wildcats lost possession of the ball
atthe Dukes’ thirty yard line. Senior
All-South player Heather Owen
went coast to coast, seventy yards
with the ball, passing two defen-
sive players and then the goalie to
score. |

“We gotcaught up offensively
because we wanted to score before
half, but JMU turned it around
faster than we could recover,”
defender Jill Bennett said. “The
turf was very fast.” The Dukes

“scored three more times after

Davidson offensive surges, mak-
ing the final score 4-0. :

_ Coach Betsy Brown said, “I
don’t consider the final outcome a
good description of the game. It
wasa good learning experience for
everyone and next year will be

The Davidson men’s soccer team lost to UNC Greensboro 4-2 in

overtime Friday, dropping their record to 1-4-1 entering Sunday’s
meeting with College of Charleston. The team next plays at home
Wednesday, Oct. 9 against N.C. State.
