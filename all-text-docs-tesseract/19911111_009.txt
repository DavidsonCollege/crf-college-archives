Commons Serves Uncommon Food

For the past couple of weeks I
have been wondering where on
earth the Vail Commons finds its
recipes. Don’t get me wrong, I
really appreciate the fine cuisine
this establishmentoffers Davidson
students.

Seriously, you should sample
the Frosted Flakes-- I promise that
they’re really good. Sometimes,
however, I am ata loss when con-
sidering the marvelous array of
different dishes which are offered.

Take last week, for example. I
have a vague suspicion that the

Commons was attempting to be
culturally diverse, like most other
establishments on Campus.

We were offered a variety of
different dishes from each corner

‘of the world. Mexican night saw
the best refried beans this side of
Oaxaca.

The Tahitian dish was particu-
larly fascinating. I had no idea that
cornflake coated chicken could
possibly taste so good. I have
similar sentiments about the Greek
Gyro. Most interesting: my room-
mate is still recovering.

Who Can Save Mother Nature’?

By Jim Weaver

So maybe you’re not over-
whelmed with gobs of money,
wanting to distribute it equally to
the charities of your choice. You
will be one day, God willing. Co-
incidentally, there’s an earth out
there which just might need to be
saved, and plenty of organizations
saying they’ll doit if you just give
them some sort of donation. How

do you, the discriminate philan- -

thropist, decide who gets what?

Outside Magazine, recogniz-
ing this altruistic angst, recently
compiled a list of the top 25 envi-
ronmental groups. Each group is
profiledion4he: grounds. of its: bu-,
reaucracy, financial situation, and
effectiveness. What. follows are
profile summaries for; ‘the-organi-
zations in which suidents here:
would most likely be interested.

Greenpeace U.S.A. legiti-
mately leads the pack in popular-
ity. The management is surpris-
ingly non-corrupt, considering
their budget ranks fourth highest
among the 25 groups rated. Green-
peace uses their healthy resources
to actively cause environmental
awareness, by pulling stunts that
will land them on the news. Yes,
these are the people who block
boats’ paths and too often get
rammed by said boats, but they’ve
been instrumental in spreading the
environmental message. Address:
1436 U Street NW, Washington,
DC 20009.

Earth First! has built a repu-
tation for its totally uncompromis-
ing philosophy. A self-proclaimed

monkey wrench gang, members
pour sand in bulldozer gas tanks,
hold Puke-Ins at shopping malls,
and until recently they spiked trees,
They also get infiltrated by the
FBI, and they often get arrested.
Earth First! is poor, too, with a
budget ofapproximately $150,000.
A donation to Earth First! would
not be squandered by any corrupt
executive; it would be used to
defend the earth by any means
possible. Address: Box 5871,
Tuscon, AZ 85703.

Ducks. Unlimited, besides
having groovy decals, has pre-
served over 200,000 acres of wet-

Jands since, 1984., Why? To, save.

ducks. To shoot. They’re hunters.
They’re also saving a lot of land.
With a budget of $67.4 million,
they’ye restored migration routes
in California, opened an office in
Washington to develop waterfowl
management plans, as well as to
protect that land. Essentially,
they’re effective environmentalists
whohate being called environmen-
talists. Address: One Waterfowl
Way, Long Grove, IL 60047.
Sierra Club has maintained
itself as a group of political real-
ists. Its lobbyists can be found on
the state and local level. Its mem-
bers have “maneuvered. green
candidates into: congressional
seats,”and were prime movers of
the Clean Air Act. Their realism
keeps them from being too radical,
though they are more so than any
of the other mainline groups.
Address: 730 Polk Street, San
Francisco, CA 94109. (An offshoot

group, Sierra Club Legal Defense
Fund, puts less faith in politics,
compromising less.)

The Nature . Conservancy
buys things. They’re loaded, and

this gives them the liberty to buy. §

land and protect “more than 1,600
private nature preserves nation-
wide.” The majority of their in-
come “comes from holding land
for and selling land to.the govern-
ment.” In reality, they don’t need
college students’ money.
National Wildlife Federation
doesn’ tcome off too well: the CEO
maintains a $200,000 salary, and
they’ve been known to sell do-
,ated land, intended for, nature
_ preserves, to deve opers. ‘Ranger
© Rick” is their main contribution.
Though environmental groups
depend on our support to be effec-
- tive on a grand level, our own
donations of time and effort are
equally, if not more, effective in
helping our environment. Meth-
ods need not be detailed here; we’re
all fairly familiar with them. Still,
to be wholly effective requires
support of large, active groups. If
you would like to learn more about
these organizations or about what
you can do to help, or if you have
_ Suggestions, join.us on Wednes-
day, November 13, at 9 pm in the
Union for the next Environmental
Action Group Meeting.

Choose wisely.

Frosh International Quiz Results

By Jennifer Reid
Recently, student-faculty
teams representing the Dean Rusk

Program retumed this year’s Inter-
national Awareness Tests to fresh-
men. These tests were comprised

of 25 general fill-in-the-blanks, 10
associations of leaders to their
* respective countries, and 15 iden-

tifications of countries on a world

map, all to be answered in 20

minutes.
Statistics compiled by Dr.

Hansford Epes indicated that the

mean score for the full test was -

55.50-- an increase of about five
points from last year’s average.
The range of scores, from 12 to
100, included only the second

perfect score in ten years.
Questions dealing with the
population of the United States
and the world seemed to present
difficulty and were answered cor-

_ rectly by 22 percentand 26 percent
of the class, respectively.

_ About one of every 15 fresh-
men identified Pearl Harbor as
being located in Japan, and only 43
percent gave the correct date for
the bombing of Hirdéshima.
Students were a bit more suc-
cessful on the map. of the
test with a mean score of 66.41.
Scores on these tests, though,
are not noted on individual rec-

-ords, and the results are primarily

for statistical analyses of the inter-

national awareness of i incoming
freshmen.

Ambassador Jack Perry, in a
meeting with Second East Belk,
stressed the importance of interna-
tional awareness and suggested that
students pursue ..opportunities
through the Dean Rusk program,
study abroad office, and acquain-
tances with international students
here at Davidson.

These tests are intended to be
an indication of prior knowledge
and an encouragement to take ad-
vantage of opportunities to become
more worldly aware.

Test yourself with the

sample quiz on page 12!

One must, however, give credit
when due. The vegetarian dishes
are nof only tasty, but also show a
great deal of creativity.

The Baked Cheese Grits are
simply awesome, and I feel obliged
tomention the wonderful Spinach-
Cheese casserole that we ate last
Wednesday. I had no idea that cold
vegetables mixed with even colder
cheese could possibly taste so good.
Maybe it was the subtle seasoning
that just made that extra-special
difference. . .

_ Finally, however, I think the

prize for haute cuisine must be
given to those wonderful cooked
breakfasts served daily.

There is nothing I appreciate
more than a plate of greasy sau-
sage and congealed oatmeal on a
Monday morning before my 8:30.
It realy makes my week-- makes
me feel good about another week
of classes at Davidson.

Butit confuses me that I see so
many people atthe Union for break-
fast and lunch. Poor fools. . . they
obviously have no idea what they
are missing.

Barkley Returng To
A Different Davidson

By Virginia Mischen

Sometimes the Davidson ex-
perience affects a graduate so much
that he or she will seize the oppor-
tunity to return to our fold. Such an
alumnus is Dr, Karl “Skip” Bar-
kley, Class of 1979. His return is a
valuable addition to the college
and the larger community.

Dr. Barkley can simultane-
ously wear several different hats.
His .reason for returning to
Davidson several months ago was
to practice family medicine at the
Davidson Clinic, but he said that
the chance to become involved in
campus life also factored in his
decision. Many studentsmay know
him as the new Director of Student

_ Health orasa team physician with

the athletic department.

He comes to us straight from a
sports medicine fellowship in
Columbus, Georgia, where he
worked at an orthopedic clinic and
served, as a team doctor for the
Auburn University basketball and
footballteams. _

_ His interestin sports medicine

reflects a personal love of athletics
which led him to compete on the
swim team all four years of his
Davidson career. He claims thathe
was no team star, but his commit-
ment was obviously deep, as evi-
denced by a tale he told of once
swimming in two meets in the
middle of exams.

As a team doctor, Barkley

covers many sports events and
works closely with the athletic
trainers. His main responsibility is
deciding when injured athletes are
ready to participate, but he also
uses his orthopedic background to
evaluate cases that would other-
wise be sent to Charlotte.

Barkley and several other
doctors at the Davidson Clinic take
turns visiting the infirmary on a
daily basis. There, they review
charts, answer student questions,
and consult with Karren Donald,
the Physician’s Assistant. If nec-
essary, they will intercede in more
Serious cases. In addition, one
doctor is always on call after infir-
mary hours.

As director, Dr. Barkley coor-
dinates the activities of the Student
Health Center. He likes his contact
with the students, but says that
they get too stressed, a-factor he
feels contributes to many of the
health problems on campus..

When asked how it feels to be
back in Davidson, Barkley replied
that itis difficult not to have flash-
backs to his own college days. He
jokingly bemoaned the fact that he
is now a “townie” and said that he
has enjoyed seeing a side of the
Davidson community which he
never knew as a student.

Currently, he is waiting to

- move into a house in town where

he will live with his wife and two
year old daughter.
