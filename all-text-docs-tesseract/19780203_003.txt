The Office for Living En-

Involvement Committee are
conducting a telephone cam-
paign during March to raise at
least $35,000 in pledges for
alumni.

The money raised by the
Living Endowment office

yearly income and expenses of

YMCA funds scholarships.

The-YM/YWCA announced
this week the results of their
fund drive, held last month, to
raise money for the George
Reedy Memorial Scholarship
Fund.

In a letter sent to Ethan
Atkin, headmaster of Bushi-
angala Secondary School,
where Reedy was teaching
when he died last September,
the YM/YWCA guaranteed
“all non-boarding fees for five
students to Bushiangala dur-
ing each of the next four
school years.”

The letter went on to say
that after this péiod is up
“the fund will be reviewed and
possibly extended.”

Over $2700 was raised
for the Fund. The YM/YWCA
suggested to Atkins
that a selection commit-
tee, composed of the Execu-
tive Committee of Bushianga-
la along with any Davidson
students teaching at the
school in Kakamega, Kenya,
interview all applicants for the
scholarship who qualify as
finalists.

The letter listed the follow-
ing criteria as basis for selec-
tion of Scholarship winners:
(1) Attendance of Bushiangala
during recent years.

(2) Consistent ranking in the -

top 20 percent of the class.
(3) Ranking in the top 20 per-
cent of the class of KJSE a-
chievement test.

(4) Christian character.

(5) Leadership potential.

(6) Participation in extra-cur-
ricular activities.

(7) Financial need.

Each scholarship is worth
125.00 dollars. Since the
school year in Kenya runs
from January to January, the
scholarship will become effec-
tive immediately after winners
are selected this month.

The YM/YWCA also an-
nounced that basement Sen-
telle was the freshman hall
which raised the most money

during the Christmas fund
drive, collecting $212.

The YM/YWCAalso
expressed its deep apprecia-
tion to students, faculty, ad-
ministrative personnel, and
especially to all the freshman
halls who helped raise money
during the Fund Drive for this
memorial to George Reedy,
and hopes, as the letter to
Atkins concluded, ‘‘these
scholarships in some small
way will continue the work
George was doing at his
untimely death.”

New procedure
clears lab conflicts

By CAROL LOPTSON
Staff Writer

A new procedure to identify
and schedule lab periods wil be
incorporated in this spring’s
registration.

There has been a need to
make better use of afternoon
periods in scheduling courses.
Few courses have been sche-
duled in afternoons because of
possible conflicts with labs.
Since lab assignments in the
past have not been made until
the first week of the term, it
has often been difficult to
know whether an afternoon
class would conflict with a lab.

Now, the Master Course

Schedule will list Biology,
Chemistry, and Plyysics lab
periods, designated by LA,
LB, etc. on the schedule. The
day of the lab section and hour
will also be listed. This will
allow students to take other
courses scheduled in the after-
noon if they meet on the three
or four days the lab does not
meet.

On the course preference
sheet, lab periods will be listed
in descending order of prefer-
ence in the non-credit section
in the lower box. Computer
programming will match labs
and courses and print them
on the student’s schedule.

‘‘There’s no real financial
panic,’”’ comments Assistant
Director of the Union William
Brown, about Davidson’s sit-
uation.

“We can’t feel good about
this, though...the (agencies
and musicians) make so much

9:30 students will phone alum-
ni, asking them for pledges.

Tim Goodell, the student
coordinator of the campaign
will recruit two student chair-
men for each week. They in
turn will select a chairman for
each evening.

“It spreads the responsibili-
ty around and it’s very effec-
tive. Only two students didn’t

show up last year,”’ explained
Bernhardt.
Last year, 175 students

participated. This year, Bern-
hardt hopes the number will

increase to 240 or 250 stu-—

dents. ‘I think this year will
be better than last year be-
cause a lot of students who
enjoyed participating last year
are coming back to help,’’ he
said.

Students averaged six calls
per hour last year, less than
telephone campaigners at
other colleges. Bernhardt be-
lieves Davidson students
spend more time talking about
Davidson with alumni. He
said, ‘‘The telephone cam-
paign provides a line of com-
munication between the Col-
lege and the alumni. To me,
that’s the real benefit.”’

“I’m excited. It’s a lot of
fun to work with these stu-
dents,” he concluded.

Sunt di

money anyway.”

The-proposals that the a-
gencies are offering the
schools differ somewhat. BMI
wishes to charge schools five
cents per student per year as a
general use fee, compared to
six cents by ASCAP and two
cents by the smaller SESAC.

“General use’’ also includes
other uses where no fee is paid
and/or no admission is charg-
ed; and where the performer of
an event is paid less than
$1000.

Orchestras, bands, and pro-
ducers of musical plays, bal-
lets, and operas usually take
out of their own performing
rights licenses, so no royalties
are charged to the sponsor.

The one major proposal that
is opposed by Executive Dir-
ector of the Association of
College, University, Commun-
ity Arts Administrators, Inc.,
William Dawson, is ASCAP’s
concert fee. Where BMI char-
ges a fee for BMI-copyrighted
material. played at a concert,
ASCAP charges a fee for any
music, ASCAP-owned or not,
that is played.

Concert rates for both agen-
cies depend on the seating
capacity of the hall. Love
Auditorium should cost $15
and $21, to BMI and ASCAP,
respectively.

Brown says that some
schools will automatically sign
contracts with the agencies,
but Davidson. will take a
wait-and-see approach.

“The big schools will be the
first to test the new laws,” and
then a clearer interpretation of
the constitutionality of these
new copyright laws will be
obtained, Brown feels.

If a school is brought to
court for infringement viola-
tions, the damages could cost
the schcol between $250 and
$10,000.
