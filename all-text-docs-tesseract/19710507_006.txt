Jerry Dean challenges voter regulations.

Dean Tests State Law

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Asst. Managing Editor

Davidson senior Jerry
Dean is involved in a ground-
breaking court case which
may ultimately give stu
dents in North Carolina the
right to vote in their college
community. »

William B. A. Culp, Jr.
the Executive Secretary. of
the Mecklenburg County
Board of Elections, has_ in-
formed Dean that his re-
quest to register to vote in
the county has been denied.

Dean, who states simply,
“LT live in North Carolina,”
considers this state his legal
residence because he is a
legal adult (21 years of age)
and has lived in the state for
four years, well over the re-
quired one-year residéncy
requirement.

Blackstock Outlines Use
Of Nonmilitary Warfare

By DAVID HANIG

The United States did not
give serious attention to the
problem of political warfare
until 1960, Paul W. Black-
stock, ROTC _ enrichment
speaker, said Tuesday in the
Morrison Room.

Speaking on the topic
“Pol tical Warfare and Pro-
paganda,” Blackstock said
that President Kennedy was
the first President to pub-
licly acknowledge the threat
of subversion.

Blackstock
cal warfare as ‘the aggres-
sive use of nonmilitary
means of interference in the
affairs of another country.

“On the strategic scale,

defined  politi-

there are three goals of po-
litical warfare — to support
the foreign policies of a
country, to gain support for
a country's ideology, and to
give a favorable impression
of a country,” he said.
According to Blackstock,
political warfare is fought
in three stages — infiltration
or penetration, forced dis-
integration of society by
playing one sub-group against

another, and subversion or
conversion.
“In every ‘society, there

are always out-groups who
have grievances against in-
groups which can be exacer-
bated by an aggressor.
“The goal of political war-
fare is to detach the loyalities
of a group and transfer these

Financial Forms

By DOUG BROWN

Asst. Managing Editor

As a result of changes in
the format, application
forms for those on financial
aid have not been released
to the student body. Accord-
ing t& Assistant Director of
Financial Aid Peter V. Ster-
ling, ‘‘We have attempted to
simplif¥ the forms.”

In Sterling’s view the new
form will allow the Finan-
cial Aid Office to acquire
information in a more rea-
sonable fashion.

No definite date has been
set for the release of the
new forms, but it will be in
the near future.

“T feel that it is to the
student's advantage to fill
out the financial information
form at a date later than
that of previous years,”’ said
Sterling. He cited that stu-
dents myst supply informa-
tion about their grade point
averages, and it would be
easier for them to know
towards the end of the term.

“It will take a person no
longer than about 20 minutes

to complete these forms,”
commented Sterling.

A number of students have
stopped by the Financial Aid
Office to inquire about the
lateness of the forms, and
Sterling has attempted to
explain to them the new pro-
cedure.

“We have been very busy
in working on the admission

loyalties to the aggressor,”
he declared.
Blackstock used 1940

France as an example of
successful political warfare.
‘‘Many Frenchmen said that
they would rather see Hitler
march down the Champs-
Elysee than ‘Radical-Socialist
Jew Leon Blum.’

‘At the sight of a German
motorcycle, whole compan-
ies of French soldiers would

decide to go home,"’ he de-
clared.
According to Blackstock,

the essential difference be-
tween the Communists and
the non-communists -is that
the communists have had for
the past fifty years a net-
work of communist parties
throughout the world.

Delayed

of the Class of 1975. Personal
contacts, phone calls, and
talking to students have
taken a great deal of our
time in ‘the last few weeks,”
said Sterling.

A great many _ students
visited Davidson in April,
and this has hindered the
preparation of the financial
aid forms.

Dean intends to make his
home in Charlotte when he
graduates this year, for he
plans to marryxa Charlotte
girl.

Were Dean not a student,
he would probably have no
difficulty in registering, but
State law prevents students
who attend trade schools,
colleges or universities from
voling in the county in which
their school is located if that
county is not their parent's
home.

That same state law. re-
quires students to vote in the
county in which their parents
reside. Dean is the son of a
Church, of God minister, and
thus has not lived in any one
place more than four years.
His parents now live in Mil-
ford, Del., which Dean has
visited for one week.

Sueh a situation is con-
sidered _an ‘ideal one for a
court test by Davidson As-
sistant Professor of Political
Science William E. Jackson,
Jr., who is interested in the

case and who has _ worked.

with Dean
ment.

in its develop-

Jackson hopes to interest
groups such as the American
Civil Liberties Union and
John Gardner's Common
Cause in Dean's case.

Dean has one alternative
to voting in Delaware —
signing an affidavit that he
plans to live in Mecklenburg
County at the completion of
his college career. Others
who move into an area for
a definite period — such as
junior. executives who are
frequently moved about—are
not required to sign such an
oath, even though they have
definite plans to move
shortly.

Dean considers such a
“double standard"’ discrim-
inatory against students and
plans to fight the law in
court. He stresses that his
case would apply -only to

On Student Voting Rights

those over 21, since his case
is based on the fact that he
is a legal adult and thus able
to determine his own future.

Jackson and Dean are in
the process of finding a law-
yer now for the court case.
Dean went before the Coun-
ty Board of Elections Wed-
nesday to sign the affidavit.
Signing it would give him

the right to vote, but would

not resolve the issue, setting
the stage for the court de-
cision. Dean did not sign.

Much of the problem re-
volves around communities
in which a large proportion
of the population is students.
In cities such as Boone, N.C.,
over 6,000 of 8,000 residents
are college students, and a
united student front could
pass bond issues which could
deeply indebt the commun-
ity for years past the time
the students are in college.

The Census Bureau counts
studénts in with the popula-
tion of .a community, and
these census figures are used
when grants are given to the
town and when representa-

tion is determined on the
local, state, and national
levels. F

In an editorial Sunday The
Charlotte Observer wrote,

"There appears no easy ans-

wer to the dilemma being
posed by the case of Jerry
Dean. Enough intricacies are
involved in finding an ac-
ceptable solution to put this
one on the burner for many
months to come."

In early June, Dean will
graduate from Davidson and
cease to be a student.

By refusing to take the
oath on Wednesday, Dean
forfeited his right to vote in
Mecklenburg county under
the existing statutes. County
election officials explained
that they were bound by the
letter of the law, leaving the
matter to the courts.
