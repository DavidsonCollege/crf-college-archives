“PROPOSED NEW. Po

“CHAMBERS HALL
DAVIDSON COLLEGE

- TO DAVIDSON MEN

By MALCOLM LOCKHART, Director of Campaign.

One of the most interesting, enter-
taining, and at the same time, gripping
books written in connection with the
World War was one entitled, “The
First Hundred Thousand.” This was
the stirring account of the mobilizing
and training of the first 100,000
soldiers of the British volunteer army,
and this 100,000, of course, represented
"the utmost devotion and the highest
patriotism to be found among the
young men of England.

It is the thought of the campaign
forces to give the Davidson faculty
and undergraduates an opportunity of
subscribing at least a considerable por-
tion of the first $100,000 to be raised
in Davidson's great campaign. Cam-
paign total to date, with the campaign
having been waged completely in only
one Presbytery, and partly in two, out
of the seven Presbyteries in the State.
is around $75,000. We are certain
that the students and faculty of ,Da-
vidson who are daily in touch with the
needs of the college, and whose daily

pathway runs through and around the
ruins of old Chambers Hall appreciate
so keenly the need that they will be
quick to subscribe their $25,000 quota
and complete the first $100,000 in sub-
scriptions, thus taking part in the first
response of loyalty to and interest in
our cause.

It was the writer's privilege to direct

the campaign for your sister iastitu-|

tion, Agnes Scott College, of Decatur,
which accomplished the subscribing of
$825,000 in toto. Of this amount tne
students and faculty subscribed on a
two-year payment basis in round num-
bers $30,000, or an average of $60 per
individual. Most of these splendid
young women will pay these pledges
from their personal resources.

In the $1,000,000 campaign of the
University of Georgia, of which the
writer is an alumnus, the under-
graduates subscribed $132,862 on a
five-year payment basis, and_ the
faculty subscribed $36,123. The stu-

THE NEW GHAMBERS

New Chambers, for months a beau-
tiful dream to the students and alumni
of Davidson, has emerged’ from the
infant stage of fancy, and is now a
conerete, tangible thing toward which
the eves of the Southern Presbyterians
are focused,

The new building will be situated on
the site where historic old Chambers
stood and in general make-up will re-
semble the old structure from the ex-
An effort will be made to
use the four columns that now stand
as a relic of the early days of the col-

terior view.

lege, but in case this can not be done
they will be reproduced as nearly as
possible. ;

“The new building will be the center
of the work of the college+its great

aworkshop—and it is thought will be

unsurpassed by any similar college
building in the South,” is the state-
ment made by Dr. W. J. Martin.

In a statement issued to the alumni
President Martin says:

“New Chambers will really consist
of three buildings, joined by corridors.

At a mecting of representatives of
the student body, the campaign forces,
and the faculty of. Davidson, the fol-
lowing committee was appointed to
conduct the campaign on the campus in
connection with the $600,000 drive, of
which $400,000 is to rebuild Chambers
Hall, $200,000 for additional endow-

ment. A

‘nore representative lot of
men could hardly be selected, and there
is universal confidence that they will
put the campaign over in a way té
uphold the traditions of Davidson and
the Wildcat spirit.
