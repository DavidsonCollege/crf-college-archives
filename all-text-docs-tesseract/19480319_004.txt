Meet Springfield ~

A visitor approaching
Richardson Field on one of these
fine, sunny spring days, is soon con-
scious of the sharp crack of bats
and calls of encouragement from
players. He, of course, immediately
recognizes the fact that Charley
Jamerson’s boys are at it again.
Under the direction of the genial
coach (when He can spare the time
from spring football practice) the
current edition of the Davidson
nine is gradually rounding into con-
dition with daily batting drills and
infield practice,

casual

A lot of the seasoned veterans
are around and there area few
new faces to add a touch of in-
terest to these drills. At third, Bert
Anderton and Bill Byrd are look-
ing good, while Charley Pearson is
holding down short. Capable Jim-
my French returns to the diamond
wars this year and is looking good
on second. First base is a question
mark with Hal Mapes and John
Ellis fighting it out for the start-
ing position’ One of the new-
comers, Dave Poole, looks like a
natural behind the plate and has
the markings of the finest catcher
that these parts have seen in years.

In the outfield “Pop” Bowman
is leading way as usual. The other

Another of the promising new-
comers who will no doubt form a

is pitcher Dick Marlowe. Marlowe

and Charleton Torrence are again
on hand along with freshman Sam
Joyner.

The daily drills will continue and
the squad is looking forward to the
first game Monday against the Yan-
kee invaders from Springfield Col-

Golfers Beat
Furman, 23-4

The Davidson golf team opened
the 1948 links campaign at the
Charlotte Country Club Wednes-
day, a week ago, by downing Fur-
man, 23 to 4.

Buck Williams fired a.78 to pace
the Cat golfers. Breazeale of Fur-
man was low for the day with a 72,
winning the Purple Hurricane’s
only match,
