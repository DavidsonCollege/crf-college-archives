Council Makes Plans

For Used Book Store

The Student Council on Mon-
day might appointed a commit-
tee to study the possibility of
beginning a Student Discount
Service. which would enable
Davidson Students to obtain dis-
counts at certain stores and
restaurants in Charlotte.

The committee, under chair-
man Dave Meschan, will work
with a similar committee from
Queens College which is al-
ready functioning. Together the
committees will visit various
establishments in Charlotte to
determine ow many would be
willing to co-operate in giving
discounts to both Davidson and
Queens students.

The Student Discount Service,
as proposed by Fred Sackett,
would operated by issuing iden-
tification cards to students at

both colleges for a nominal fee.

These cards would list the

stares and restaurants partici-

pating in the service, and these
concerns would give student
purchasers a certain discount
on items or meals bought
there.

Mf the plan for the service
is well-received by the merc-
hants in Charlotte, the council
will try to have the service in
operation by next fall.

In other business coming be-
fore the council, President Will
Jackson reported that College
Business Manager Robert A.
Currie and Book Store Manager
Peter Nicholls seemed “quite
receptive” to the idea of a used-
book store to be operated in
conjunction with the existing
book store in the Student Uni-
on. Nicholls and Professor J.

"GREAT ISSUES SPEAKER

Randolph Praises Appalachia Aid Bill :::"*

By BOB STRAUSER
Davidsonian Feature Editor
As has been noted else-
where and at other times,
the “Great Issues’’ topic for
this fall semester is “Cam-
paign — ’64.” Wednesday
a Jennings Ran-
dolph (D-W. Va.) brought to
Davidson his 30 years of ex-

rience in Washington for
he purpose of speaking to
the issue at hand.

“Fred (Fred Sackett, “Great
Issues” chairman) asked me to
speak on the anti-poverty and
Appalachian bills considered in
this session of Congress,” said
Randolph. In reality he never
discussed the antipoverty bill
but intead spent his time ex-
tolling the virtues of the pro-

posed Appalachian Regional
Deve ‘opment Dill.

“This bill is the Normandy
beachhead of our war on pov-
erty,” declared the senator. He
went on to cite the history of
the bill from its beginnings in
the minds of nine area govern-
ors (South Carolina and Ohio
later joined the group).

Better than one billion dol
lars are proposed to aid the
distressed region; Randolph
noted that two-thirds of this
amount would be spent on high-
ways to open up the area and
that any governor would have
veto power over projects in his
state.

In speaking of the problems

of Appalachia, the senator und-

erstandably spoke more direct
ly to the problems of West Vir
ginia. Eighty thousand coal min
ers have lost their jobs in that
state to automation in recent

years.

“Clay County,” he continu-
ed, “has one doctor, over 80
years old, and the closest hos-
pital is 55 miles away . . Bale
concluding his remarks on the
state, he said with a final burst
of enthusiasm. “We'll cover the
stripped sides of our moun-
tains .. . with cover.”

Ciosing out the presentation,
the speaker mentioned some
prominent conservative person.
alities. Of one of these, he said
“My distinguished colleague,

Strom Thurmond, will be here
soon I understand; perhaps it
would be better if he
until after the election.”

The coffee hour that followed
found Rando’ph speaking to a
large, colorful poster (“Target
— the unkillab’e James Bond—
Agent 007,) and about 35 ‘stu
dents and faculty gathered in
the shadow of that pictorial
narrative.

Here the senator spoke to
specific issues but as he noted,
“I don’t think you can polarize
your opinions on many of these
problems today. There are more
than two points of view.”

He spoke lightly of the sena-
tor from Arizona “flying a cov
ered wagon” and “drawing the

croquet match will be staged
again this year at 1:30 p.m.
The teams in this affaire d’

hennevr will be led by Charlie
Dibble and Pete Crow respec-
tively.

The annual outdoor barbeque
will again be held in the center
of the Patterson Fraternity
Court. As last year it will be
a joint alumniraternity affair.

Kickoff for the Homecoming
game will be at 2 p.m. Davidson
is seeking to rebound from two
consecutive defeats and even its
record. Large and powerful
Richmond seems unlikely to ac-
quiesce to the Davidson troops,
but a distinct deviation from
Homecoming tradition would be
a welcome occurrence.

Crowning of the Homecoming
Queen, chosen from among the
13 candidates, will take place at
halftime.

Immediately following the
game the fraternities are hold-
