H. W. Janson, Davidson's
first Reynolds lecturer of the
year, opened his series of
lectures with a talk on ‘‘Art
and Religion” Tuesday after-
noon.

In contrast, he said that the
style of the Northerners, and
in particular that of the Dutch
painter Bosch, portrayed fig-
ures lacking in dignity.

others on chance. He said
that to them “chance was
equivalent to inspiration or
genius,” being considered ‘‘a
sign of divine favor.”

Janson pointed to the
Greeks’ ornamentation of
their gravestones with leaf
foilages which through some
unknown artist’s inspiration
assumed fascail characteris-
tics. _ .

Through time, the making _
of faces out of foliage be-
came a common practice.
The faces thus became “‘in-
stitutionalized chance im-
ages” which were repeated
by later artists, he said.

Janson then turned his at-

Janson concluded by men-
tioning the modern Abstract
Impressionists, whom he de-
fended against the claims of
many conservatives that
their work was not really art.

“Out of the prompting of

the muse of chance” art is

‘ Janson continued his lecy
tures on Wednesday morning
with a presentation on the
famed italian artist and scul-
pter Denateile.

Later Wednesday morning,
with the aid of slides in a
darkened Hodson Hall, Jan-
son presented the art of the
Modern School, which he de-
fined on the basis of the dis-
tinctive features of this new

He showed slides where the.

modern period in art began
during the seeond half of the
18th Century, influenced by
the revolutionary changes oc-
curring at this time.

The first of the distinctive
features between modern art
and the art which preceded’
it was the feeling of modern
artists that they were sepa-
rate from their classes, ser-
ving instead as social pro-
Phets and philosophers,
rendering criticism and jud-
gement on the modern world.

The second characteristic
wes what Janson called the
“monumentalization of pri-
vate adventure,” a, major
change from the former em-
phasis on religious and Bib-
lical themes.

The third of these distinc.
tions was the substitution of
nationalistic scenes and
characters for formerly Bib-
lical creations. Janson term-
