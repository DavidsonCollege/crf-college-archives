FRESHMAN LECTURES
STARTED LAST WEEK

The lectures for the Freshman class
were started last) Wednesday morning.
J. H. Miller, president of the student
body, spoke to the Freshman class on the
Constitution of the Student) Body, on
Self Government and. its Advantages.
and on the Honor System. He mention
ed all the traditions of the college that
do so much, to make Davidson what it
is: tipping the hat to members of the
faculty, speaking to everyone you incest,
and the respect due to the upper clas.-
men. He added that the quiet, unas-
sunung Freshman gains the respect of
the upper classmen and has nothing tu
gain b, self-assertion,

Coach Fetzer. who was the main
speaker, had for his subject, ‘Physical
Exercise and Athletics.” He emphasizea
the importance of some kind .of exercise.
daily, if nothing more than deep breath
ing and a couple of minutes of setting-up
exercises in the morning. In connection
with this, he brought up the different
forms of athletics which help to develop
the man physically. “Phese things should
not, however, be placed above the regu-
lar studies, but should go along with
them. Every man should have a sched-
ule with a regular time for play and
study and should let nothing interfere
avith his study period. He should also
attend all classes and get the most pos-
sible out of cach one.

Coach Fetzer also made a few re-
marks about some Davidson customs.
Among these, he mentioned the custom
of tipping hats to professors, the close
relationship that should exist between
the professors and students, and customs

_ dealing with the different classes. With-
out some class distinctions, there would
be very little college spirit or “pep.”

Needless to say, everyone present was

interested in and benefited by Coach’s
talk.

He flunked in German,
He flunked in Chem,
They heard him softly hiss;
“T'd like to find the man who said
That ignorance is bliss.’—FEx.

PARABLE OF FRESH AND SOPEL.

And it came to pass in those days that
there was in the lind of North Carolina
an institution of learning, to-wit David-
son College, honored greatly upon the

face of the land. And there dwelt in the
city of Davidson, in the said school ot
learning. as thou comest by the old zym,
two men, And the name of the one was
Soph and the name of the other was
Fresh. Now Soph was a wise man, skill:
ed’ and cunning in all the ways of the
campus, howhbeit wise ine his own con:
ceits; and Fresh was a timid man, being
sorely oppressed by the bondage which
Soph did inflict upon bim: for in’ those
days Fresh must needs do homage to
Soph and all their service, wherein they
were made to serve, was with with riger.
And Soph was grieved because of Fresh.
Now there arose a new Soph, which
was compassionate of heart and he heark-
ened unto the cries of Fresh and renov
er the burdens which had been placed
upon him. And Fresh rejoiced — with
mighty shoutings and with mach joy.
Now it came to pass in the process of
time that Fresh grew large of head, and
hard of heart, and forgat the days of his
bondage, when he did serve Soph with
rigor. And Fresh hardened his heart
to wisdom and turned from the paths ot
diseretion,
puffed up and said to himselt:

unto the house of # pawnbroker and
bought him a derby for six bits. And

he returned unto the campus of David-
son and he strode up the way in a naugh-
ty and proud manner and he did place
the derby on the east side of his head so
that it did fain cover his right ear.

Now Soph had become troubled of
mind at the peculiar and naughty bear
ing of Fresh. And on this day it came
to pass that Soph met the army of the
‘Vickets and was sorely stricken so that
he was much distressed of mind. And
he arose and departed from the Hall of
Shearer and he lifted up his eyes and
behold Fresh and the derby drew near.
And Soph’s anger waxed hot within him.
And he girded up his loins and descend-
ed upon Fresh with a fierce and mighty
shout: for he repented of the kindness
which he had done unto Fresh, in that
he had removed -his bondage. And in
that day did Soph inflict Fresh with a
mighty paddling, so that he was reduced
to his former state of bondage. Selah.

What Really Mattered.

He was avery small boy. Paddy was
his dog, and Paddy was nearer to his
heart than anything on earth, When
Paddy met switt and hideous death on
the turnpike road the boy's mother trem-
bled to break the news, But it had to
be, and when he came home from school
she told hint simply:

“Paddy has been run over and killed.”

He took it very quietly, ATL day it
was the same. But five minutes after
he had pone to bed there echoed through
the house a shrill and sudden lamenta-
tion. His mother rushed up stairs with
solicitude and pity,

“Nurse sass. he sobbed, “that Paddy
has heen run over and killed.”

“Bat. dear, | told you that at dinner,
and you dida‘t seem to be troubled at
all.”

“No: bute but bE dida’t knew you
said Paddy. 1—! thought you said
