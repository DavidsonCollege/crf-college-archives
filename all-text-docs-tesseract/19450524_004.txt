William Rule Speaks
_ Twice At Davidson

William Rule III, Medical Mis-
sionary of the Southern Presbyter-
jan Church was recently a visitor
on the Davidson College Campus.
Dr. Rule spoke to the students and
to the people of the Davidson com-
munity at the Sunday Vespers,
April 29.

A native of Knoxville, Tenn., Dr.
Rule was an honor graduate of
the Davidson class of 1932 and re-
ceived his medical degree ftom the
University of Pennsylvania, He and
Mrs. Rule and their children are
now home on furlough after spend-
ing tour years in the Belgian Con-
go. Supported by the Young People
of the First Presbyterian church of
Winston-Salem, Dr. and’ Mrs. Rule
arrived in the states by plane and
have spent the past few weeks in
Knoxville. For the last few days
they have been with jriends in
Mooresville. Dr. Rule will take
a course in tropical diseases before
returning to the mission ficld.

Dr. Rule’s message at Vespers

Op
Dr.

was a restatement of the simple |-

truth of the Gospel as contained in
Paul’s first Epistle to the Corin-
thians, verses three and four, which
he declared to be adequate to sal-
vation. “The people of our missions
in Africa”, he said, “Understand
that Christ died for our sins, and

and find in that truth a new life

and satisfying joy.”

Another year draws to a close,

and many of the ‘present student
| body will never roam the campus.
again, and Yet, others will come
again aster this great confttet is
over and after faithfully completing
their service in the armed services.

Wherever you go and what ever

your task may be, always keep the
tradition that is Davidsons and
to inspire throughout the past ycar.
Davidson men are known far and
wide for, what they stand for. We

thust continye to liy® up to the

traditions that have cen so ably

laid down by our predecessors who

are fighting all over the world” and

constantly think and pray that we,

here at Davidson, may keep the

standards that Davidson 4s knoyn

for. “Think on these things,” -where-

ever you go and whatever you do.

J. P. Alexander gave a very
thought provokin¥ talk in Chanel
last Friday that should cause a grcht
deal of scrious thinking. Jim point-
ed out that Davidson is a place re-
spected by these who have gone
through the same portals, studied
the same courses, attended the same
Hall Prayer Mectings, entered the
same type of bull sessions, :and in
all had the same experiences that ~
we experience every day. It is the
duty of cach of ug to carry on this’
tradition Yhat is Davidsons and
pass it on to those who follow in-
our stops. Have we accomplished °
what we had intended to do this
year? Oj course, many of us ‘will
agree that we have not, but. still
those who have, should be proud.
Those of us should strive to make
the forthcoming year a year of ac-

[| complishments, and those who will

not return should endeavor to con-

| nue their education when “the war

is over,
The first Sunday in May he stu-

| dents heard Dr, K. J. Foreman, of ;

the faculty, speak at vespers on
“Victory Has Many Wounds." The-
battle of good and evil has been
going on for countless eons. So

‘Vidtory has many battles to fight in

order to over come €¥it- It isn't
am easy battle. We must expect
many wourds, since in Victory.

Christ’ died, We must expect the
same. Victéry is movement, not like.
marble statues that are placed in
many ,of our cities as tribute to
victory. They. are not progressive.
Poetry is only words, and prayer
isn't Victory. Action is the only kind
of-Victory over evil, action that will |
fight against sin and corruption. ~

Last Sunday Presdent A..R. Kep-
pel of Catawba. College spoke on
the Highway of the Spirit. Dr. Kep-
pel said that there were many high-
ways of the spirit; such as, the
music, nature, — persons,
silence, and solitude. We can make
our highways open into many diverse
fields that will prove beneficial to
us. Yet, our highways can be black-

‘}ed by arrogance, greed, lust, hypo-

crisy, hate, and envy. However, there
are many ways to keep these high-
Ways open. such as guarding them,
and using them, Do we have person-
al devotion? Do wexthank God
daily? Does your life embrace God >
Is your body the temple of God?
If we can say that  tliese things
are fulfilled in our lives, we are
iraversing the highway oflife-Orh-
in fulfilling these requirethents can
we, have an enduring peace.’ With-

out it we can have no peace. Finally,

we can travel one of three ways
through life. The low way, which
ig traversed by the majority of the
people; the middle way along the
muddy flats; and the highway, which

rleads_to life eternal and happiness:

Well this ends another year, and
it -has been a successful one, al-.
though we faced many difficpities, .
Yet if we try to live up to the
standards that “are oyrs for the asx-
ing, our lives will prove to be suc-
cessful. Let us always remember
the standards that Davidson. has
taught, “Think on these Things”.
