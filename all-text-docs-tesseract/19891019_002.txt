Duke professor of economics examines Soviet reform

By CAROL GATEWOOD

A main feature of the Dean
Rusk conference on the Soviet
Union last week was the ad-
dress by Thomas Naylor, pro-
fessor of economics at Duke
University. Professor of Eco-
nomics at Duke University.
Naylor discussed the economic
reforms which President
Mikhail Gorbachev has initi-
ated through the program of
perestroika.

Naylor’s overall analysis
suggested that Gorbachev's
restructuring of the Soviet
Union is only part of a long
process that began before his
ascent into the political light.
The current changes are merely
reform as opposed to a new
revolution. Great problems
exist within the Soviet Union.
Naylor’s comparison between
those challenges and those in

the United States served as a
warning to U.S. policy-makers
that there is something to be
learned from Gorbachev's ac-
tions in the Soviet Union.

Naylor initially pointed
out that ideas of reform and re-
structuring began before for-
mer leader Brezhnev even
died. When Naylor travelled to
the Soviet Union in 1982, ex-
perts were studying the effects
of introducing a more decen-
tralized economic system. The
standard of living in the Soviet
Union had come the point
where something had to be
done.

With respect to Gor-
bachev’s new reforms, stated
Naylor, opening up foreign
trade is the most radical idea.
Naylor stressed the impor-
tance of mutual cooperation
that both the superpowers

must achieve in order for trade
relations to grow. On the lack
of cooperation by the U.S.,
Naylor said, “No one has told
Congress that thé Cold War is
over.” Headded that American
sovietologists “who are still
living in the 1950s” are to
blame.

Overall, Gorbachev will
have a lot of obstacles to over-
come with his economic re-
forms. As Naylor pointed out,
the Soviet leader is turning
around a “risk-free” society
that will encounter some prob-
lems when the state decentral-
izes and gives more power to
each republic. This unraveling
of supreme Soviet control has,
and will, cause tensions to
grow—as demonstrated by the
mine strikers and unrest in the
Balticstates. In response to this,
Gorbachev has had to take a

“non-adversarial approach,”

and Naylor implied through
his speech that Gorbachev is off
to good start on the road to
reform.

In conclusion, Naylor out-
lined parallel problems which
both the U.S. and Soviet Union
have today, though each coun-
try operates under different
ideological structuresand poli-
cies.

These. included alienation
within large companies that
have developed authoritarian
organization structure, injus-
tice for the poverty stricken,
excessive militarism,economic
malaise, a lack of economic
competitiveness, declining in-
ternational influence, war and
terrorism and aiding global
development in Third World

John Evans, a conference partici-
pant on leave from the State Depart-

ment spoke on changing U.S/Soviet:

relations. He emphasized the economic
importance of talking with the Soviet
Union. Both countries need to apply
military funds to rebuilding their
economies. Only a firm relationship be-
tween the U.S. and the Soviet Union
could make this possible.

Citizens within the Soviet Union
are intensely curious about the growing

relationship with the U.S.. Tass corre-
spondent Yuri Kirilchenko has been
covering stories in the U.S. for two
years. He stressed the importance that
Soviet’s put on knowing the details of
USS. life. “Our people are very anxious
to read what makes this country tick,”
said Kirilchenko.

Other speakers at the conference
included Duke University economics
professor Thomas Naylor, Soviet
emigre Tatyana Momonava, and Mar-
tin Shulman, chief Soviet adviser in
President Jimmy Carter’s State Depart-
ment.

dom, equality and efficiency.”

According to Williams, the reforms
have a possible drawback in that “they
represent reform from above by the
state, not a revolution from below, and
could in fact be withdrawn by a strong
leader facing conservative political
opposition in Moscow and rebellion in
the borderlands.”

With glasnost, “the Soviet Union
has changed dramatically fromaclosed
toan open society in terms of informa-
tion,” said Williams. However,
glasnost’s economic counterpart, per-
estroika, is not necessarily helped by
freedom of opinion arid speech.

“Short-term freedoms have re-
sulted in a worsened economic situ-

ation, complete with shortages, strikes,
and rationing” Williams stated.

Economic problems weaken Gor-'
bachev’s efforts to pursue open trade
with the West.

“He appears to be willing to move
from the bipolar world of Cold War
Soviet-American rivalry to the multipo-
lar world of Japanese banking, Euro-
pean common markets and Chinese
reconciliation,” said Williams. “But
what do the Russians have to sell that
we would want to buy?”

Despite the fact that Gorbachev still
faces some large obstacles, Williams is
astounded by the leader’s accomplish-
ments thus far. “Gorbachev the indi-
vidual has accomplished far more than
any of us could have guessed, or that
Russian and Soviet history should have
permitted,” he said. ;
