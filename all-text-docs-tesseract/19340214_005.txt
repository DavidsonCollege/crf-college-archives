THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 14, 1934

K. A’s WIN FRAT.
CAGE TITLE

Around the Wildcat’s Lair |

COCHRAN SETS
NEW RECORD

Now that “Old Boy” .Norvelle, the

renowned orchid thrower, has with-
drawn from school, sophomore mem-
bers of the reporters’ staff have fallen
heir to the editing of sports in The
Davidsonian, and this week while my
colleague is making up the page it is
the duty of yours truly to do a bit of
firing at random,

Our varsity basketeers cinched
the cellar position in the big five
race when they lost to N. C. State
and Wake Forest last Wednesday
and Thursday nights, respectively.
Their season’s percentage was
boosted, however, by their defeat
of the Lenoir-Rhyne Bears on Sat-
urday evening. Monday and Tues-
day the ’Cats invaded other big
five lairs, taking on Duke and Car-
olina, the two favored contenders
for the state championship. The
'Kitten five also engaged these op-
ponents along with the upperclass-
men. No scores are available as
this goes to press.

Two of the smoothest quintets in
Southern—prep—circles—showed their
wares on the local court during the
week-end, when on Friday night the
Darlington Tigers of Rome, Ga., took
a drubbing from the Wildkitten five,
and Saturday evening the McCallie
School team from _ Chattanooga
promptly. and thoroughly trounced the
frosh. Potts for the Romans and.Sims
of the McCallie quint were the satel-
ites for the visitors. They knew where
the basket was and didn’t seem to
have any trouble putting the old
spheroid through it.

Felix, the grey-furred feline, who
keeps himself in the wired cage
near the north end of the gymna-
sium, is pretty well informed about
what is going on around the Wild-
cat lair, and he says “Doc” New-
ton and Gene McEver are going to
put an eleven on the gridiron next
fall that will make’ all of the big-
time coaches at other big five col-
leges sit up and take notice. He
asserts that the West Pointers will
warm the ’Cats up for Duke, Caro-
lina, and State, through whom the
Newton-McEver aggregation will
run like a. fire truck through traf-
fic. That all sounds mighty good,
Mr. Felix, and if those pony ‘backs
of the '33 line-up can hold their
stride, with scrapping
row of forwards to help them get
started, yes, sir, the Wildcat grid-
men will go to glory.

another

Spring practice hasn't shown enough
yet for many prognostications to be
advanced, but with the lettermen re-
turning and some promising members
of last fall’s yearling squad as candi-
dates, it has the earmarks of being an
epochal year in Davidson football.

By the way, if you want to read

some interesting Davidson grid
history, get copies of The Char-
lotte News for the past few weeks
and read “Isonglass,” a sports col-
umn by Wade Ison. He has been
sponsoring an all-time Davidson
football contest, and nearly every
day for about three weeks some
story concerning either an individ-
ual star or some team that shared
in making gridiron history for the
Wildcats, has appeared in his ar-
ticle. This contest closes tomorrow
and all indications are that one of
our present stars, Johnny Mack-
orell, will occupy a backfield post
on the final selection. Anyone will
do, he can play them all.

Coach Unger’s grapplers lost their
first match to a North Carolina foe
when they were taken down Saturday
night by the Blue Devil matmen. So
iar these boys have had a rather dis-
astrous season, due to handicaps of
various sorts, but they aren’t through,
you'll hear something from this wrest-
ling squad yet.

The boys from the Orient are,

no doubt, glad to know that a

soccer football field has been laid

off on the lower athletic ground.

This is a great game and will make

an excellent addition to! the intra-

mural sports program.

Jake Wade's “ Golden Glove” tourna-
ment went over in a big way. There
were more than 200 fighters taking
part, boys who fought for the love

Victory

Kappa Alpha routed Sigma’ Phi Ep-
silon, 36-19, in the finals of the inter-
fraternity basketball tourney Monday
night. The game, at first, was slow,
with neither team making much prog-
ress, but the K. A.’s soon found the
basket and, led by Bill Lay, the out-
standing player of the evening, they
soon forged ahead, 17-19, at half time.
In the second half they continued their
stellar play, and continued to increase
their lead, giving the S. P. E.'s little
opportunity to score. Lay was high
scorer, amassing a total of 21 points.
Downie, with 10 points, also played
for the winners, while Barnett
was best for the losers, The K. A.’s
won their right to play in the finals
with) wins over the Phi Delts and the
Phi Gams, while the S. P. E.’s beat the
Kappa Sigs and the Pikas.

The line-up for the final contest was:

K. A. (36) Posi. S. P. E. (19)
McCallie (2) R.F. Hunter (1)
McPhail (5) L.F. Barnett (7)

Substitutions—K, A.: Dubose; S. P.
E.: Jenkins, Casali, Swope, Knox.

In the semi-finals, the S. P. E.'s
turned back the Kappa Sigs, 17-16, in
one of the most exciting games of the
tourney. Neither team was ever ahead
more than three points, and the game
was in doubt right up to the final
whistle. Jenkins and Barnett were
best for the winners, while Gaw and
Rives stood out among the players of
the losing team.

The line-up is as follows

SP. E. Posi. Kappa Sig
Jenkins (4) R.F. Rives (5)
Hunter (3) L.F. Gaw (5)
Snead (2) Center Rose (2)
Barnette (5) R.G. Lindsay (2)
Elvery L.G. Byerly (3)

Substitutions—S, P. E.: MeCall (2).

The other semi-final game was not
as exciting, the K. A.’s running rough-
shod over the Phi Delts, winning 36-11,
Their-smooth machine began clicking
at the outset and coasted along to an
vasy victory. Downie and Lay won
scoring honors, each getting 13 points.
West and Barnes for the losers scored
most of the Phi Delt. points.

K. A. (36) Posi. Phi Delts (11)
Downie (13) R.F. Barnes (4)

In the other two games last week,
the Kappa Sigs entered the semi-finals
by virtue of their 27-20 win over the
S. A. E.’s, while the S. P. E.’s defeated

Cast Your Ballot

The widely publicized contest
for the All-Time Davidson foot-
ball team comes to a close at
noon, Thursday. All students
who have not yet cast their votes
but wish to do so are reminded
that their ballots must be in by
that time.

Although the contest is draw-
ing to a close, there has been no
let-up in the voting, and spon-
sors believe that even if it were
drawn out a year votes would
continue to come in.

Ballots and a partial list of
probable candidates appeared in
last week’s edition of The David-
sonian.
