“We're at the crossroads of
the season now. We haven’t had
enough matches to tell how
things will work out. We could
have a good team: We- need
some people to begin to domi-
nate matches,’’ said Coach Jeff
Frank of the Wildcat men’s
tennis team. And, as they
began their trek toward the
Southern Conference tourna-
ment, the Cats ‘returned the
whipping of last year from
Atlantic Christian College, the
1979 NAIA National Champ-
ions, by beating them 7-2.
Though the team’s record is
just 6-5, Coach Frank empha-
sized the fact that ‘‘we’ve never
been out of a match, and we’ve
never lost a match that we

‘should have won.”

Of the conference, Frank said
that the conference is ‘‘more
balanced now than in the past
four years. Five teams have
a really good chance of winning
the conference: Appalachian,
East Tennessee State, UT-
Chattanooga, Furman, and

losing three straight. The Wild-
cats now have an overall record
of 10-9-and a conference mark of
6-2. Junior John Haskell saw
the games against VMI as
critical in restoring confidence

and “by putting Davidson back -

in the conference race."
The Cats started out last
by losing to Wake Forest
‘6-4 in a close contest. Davidson
led most of the.way behind the
strong pitching of Rusty Col-

inning allowed the Deacons to
come from behind for the vic-
tory.

ched well in relief and now leads
the team with a 1.59 earned run

Davidson then got back on
the eight track by defeating
VMI convincingly by scores of
6-3 and 6-1. Rusty Colechia was
the winning pitcher in the first
game and pitched a complete
game while striking out seven.
John Marstiall and John Has-
kell added home runs to pace
Davidson's hitting attack. In
the second game Chip Christian
had a shutout through six
innings and won his first game
of the year: Haskell added a
homer in the second game as
well and had 6 runs batted in for
the day.

The team aspect has been an
important factor in the cat's
success but individual effort has
also played a big role in David-
son’s winning. John Haskell
still leads the team in hitting
with a .383 mark and has hit
five home runs as well. Fresh-
man John Marshall and Bobby
Barnes are both batting over
.330 and are hitting the ball in
clutch situations. The victories
by Christian and Colechia pro-

and similar fine outings by
these two as well as by Jon
