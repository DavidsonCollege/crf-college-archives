Last Monday, ina burst of anti-
ethnocentrism, the Birks decided
to take in a show. The
“American Pictures”

matters.” Steele suggests that the
“goal of these provocations is to
put whites, no matter how-indi-
rectly, in touch with .. . collective
guilt.” Steele’s thesis, in “I’m
Black, You’re White, Who’s Inno-
cent?”. (Harper’s, June 1988),
concludes thatrace distinctions can
more easily be defined as “‘com-
peting power groups.”

Although Holdt tried to couch

erkegaard tells us, and it has never
been easy for whites to avoid-guilt
where blacks are concerned.”
According to Steele, white
America supports black entertain-

_ers like Bill Cosby because he

offers a secure, guilt-free image of
blacks. In an effort to repudiate
this image, blacks have accepted
“victimization metamorphosed
into power via innocence. It is a

formula that binds

the victim to his

show, to be precise. From
the roughly four million
posters put up on campus,
we discerned that ‘this
event would be an exer-
cise in cultural
awareness—an opportu-
nity to learn something
about the American un-
derclass.
Well, if you call four
hours in the heart of dark-
ness listening to some guy
from Denmark exhort us
to “embrace our racism,”
an opportunity in cultural
awareness,. then yes, it
probably was. If, how-

victimization by
linking his power
to his status as a
victim . . . Since
the social victim
has been op-
pressed by soci-
ety, he comes to
feel that his indi-
vidual life will be
improved more
by changes in
society than by his
own initiative.”
According to
Steele, there have
been “twenty
years of decline

ever, you find such events

more an exercise in victimization
and white guilt, then you were
probably wise to stay away (the
audience dwindled as the polemic
progressed).

The stated intention of the show
was to “create emotions in you not
unlike blacks have.” The artist,
Jacob Holdt, begins his exhibit (a
collection of slides) with the prem-
ise that “reverse-oppression”’ will
allow the audience to experience a
“seemingly endless bombardment
of statements of the type blacks
have always tried to expressto us.”

As a result, Holdt admits that
his exhibit is deliberately biased
towards a “one-sided worm’s eye
view, from the position of those
worst off.” If you ever thought
there was anything romantic, or
prosaic about society’s underbelly,
this collection should change that.

' Being poor black, or -poor
white, means living in shacks,
working like a slave in a sweat-
shop or the fields, and dying’ an
early death. At irregular points,
the photographs Holdt presents are
both stunningly powerful, and an
indictment against a society that
can allow such injustices to occur.
Most, however, are cruder and
more overtly political. Athis best,
Holdt makes you reflect on your

own values; at his worst, he makes. -

you sick. Unfortunately, the best
are the minority.

Apart from the stylistic ele-
ment’s of Holdt’s exhibit, the nar-
ration that accompanied it was
without excuse. Essentially, Holdt
approached his exhibit with the

purpose of confronting his audi-

ence and forcing them to examine
their own social justifications by
making them feel “oppressed.”

__ This approach operates out of
an identity that black sociologist

Shelby Steele says “obliges them -

to badger white people about race
almoston principle. Contenthardly

his rhetoric in terms of absolving
blacks of totally representing ur-
ban and rural poverty, his narra-
tion was heavily skewed toward
black as victim. He made sweep-
ing over-generalizations on Ameri-
can society and concluded thatthe
economic disparity between blacks
and whites (and hence, all the pain

_and suffering in his photographs)

was caused by a universal racism
that “we” must learn to embrace in
order to overcome it.

When “we” (the Birks) asked
if he had any evidence to support
his assertions, Holdt cited the
minority concentration in the inner
cities, and suggested thata welfare
‘state modeled on Denmark was the
only equitable solution.

Walter Williams, a black
economist at George Mason Uni-
versity, disagrees. According to
Williams, “There is a large seg-
mentof black people who are poor,
and for whom there appears to be
no hope under the status quo.”
Williams objects to the conclusion
that social disparities (i.e. income,
education, etc.) are the result of
discrimination.

He notes other minority groups
(Jewish and Asian) that overcame
“gross discrimination” to become
economically successful.

The median age of white
Americansis 31, while the median
age of black Americansis only 21.
Comparing the two groups net
earnings is like comparing some-
one in mid-career with someone
just starting out. “I’m not saying

that discrimination does not exist .

.. what I am suggesting is that dis-
crimination; all by itself, just can-
not explain very much,”

Shelby Steele’s essay comat
deal more objective than Holdt’s
exhibit and might shed some light
on the questions he raises. Steele

notes that “the loss of-innocence-

has always to do with guilt, Ki-

and demoraliza-
tion, even as opportunities for
blacks to better themselves have
increased . . . but there is a reluc-
tance among blacks to examine
this paradox . .. because it suggests
that racial victimization is not our
real problem. If conditions have
worsened for most of us.as racism
has receded, then much of the
problem must be of our own mak-
ing.”

Holdtapproaches the question
of black confinement: within an
economic poverty matrix with the
goal of assessing blame and col-
lecting the reforms induced by
guilt. Steele characterizes this
mindsetas “seeing for innocence.”

He suggests: that “Seeing for
innocence pressures blacks to
focus on racism and to neglect the
individual initiative that would
deliver them from poverty--the
only thing that delivers anyone
from poverty.”

His conclusion: “In this soci-
ety, race must not be a source of
advantage or disadvantage for
anyone. This is fundamentally a

‘moral position, one that seeks to

breach the corrupt union of race
and power with principles of fair-
ness and- human equality: if all
men are created equal, then racial
difference cannot sanction power .

.. What made King the most pow-.

erfuland extraordinary black leader

of this century was not his race but

his morality ... What both black
and white Americans fear are the
sacrifices and risks that true racial
harmony demands... . it would be
right.to suggest courage as an anti-
dote to fear . ....we should have

made the effort.” What more aaa

wesay? -

Just this: Jacob Holdt’s over-
simplification of the American
poverty dynamic reduces a com-

plex issue to simple blame. Obvi-

ously, thisneither benefits the poor,
nor.offers constructive solutions.

Jacob Holdt Opens Eyes

By Mike Moriarty
A relatively simple man from
Denmark, Jacob Holdt, came to
Davidson last Tuesday night, show-
ing some very disturbing and

last Thursday night and Friday
morning in which this topic was
the focus. Two preeminent experts
in the field spoke, Kevin Phillips

were, from gunshot wounds to body
parts to the appalling hatred of the
KKK. We may be able to lead the

- world militarily and stop Iraq in a

matter of days, but America is by
no means a universal model.
Holdt stated that in some neigh-
borhoods in Harlem, blacks com-
prise 96% of the population, not-
ing that the last time a country has
so physically isolated a-minority
(with the obvious exception of
South Africa) was Nazi Germany.
Also, Holdt said that by the year
2000, the unemployment rate for
blacks may reach 70%. These are
rather embarrassing figures for the
world’s supposedly most civilized
country.
Inequality still pervades all
aspects of American society,
whether it be by income, race, or

serving. But when those below the
poverty line represent anywhere
from 12-20% of the country’s
population, it simply is impossible
to do so. Add to this those victims
of racism and other forms of injus-
tice, one begins to see the severity
of the problems. Dr. Wilson found
that despite all the rhetoric, most of
those jobless in the inner-city do
want to work.

There are solutions to the press-
ing social problems of our time,
yet the disgrace is not that we lack
the answers, but that we so often
lack the initiative to even try to
find these solutions. We condemn
so many countries for not having a
democracy and treating people
cruelly or unfairly. When we do
not even try to solve the problems
facing 1/5 of our fellow citizens or
more, who are we to criticize? —
