The Y. M. C. A. began their new: year
services last Sunday with an interesting and
inspirational sermon by H. D. Corbett. The

subject of this speech was “A Square Deal,” |

Mr. Corbett is pastor of the Presbyterian
Church at Bowling Green, S. C., and grad-

uated from Davidson in the class of 1923. |

Mr. Jackson introduced the speaker and
pointed out that he enjoys the confidence of
his people as much as is found in any con-
gregation. ‘

At the start of his speech, Mr. Corbett |
alluded to the great demands for a square |
|

deal in the world of today. The recent as-
sassins in Chicago, Belgium during the World
War, and many groups of strikers have all
demanded it. The demand and exigency of a
square deal is required everywhere.

“When we talk of a square deal, there are
three parties we must deal with, viz., God,
our fellowman, and ourSelves.”’ When we
think of dealing with our God, Mr. Corbett
pointed out we must deal squarely with the

church. David of old preferred Zion as his
first choice. Furthermore we must, in deal-
ing squarely with God, deal truly with

Christ, the Word of God, and, finally, the
standard that is found within the
These different divisions of the speech were
wonderfully illustrated by examples drawn
from the personal experience of the speaker.

“We must deal squarely with our fellow- |

man.” Billy Sunday impressed audiences be-
cause he got men to become fiery for Jesus.

T'S more than a nation-wide shift from one ciga-

More and more men are demanding a cigarette of
natural tobacco taste. Men want a cigarette in which
the character and goodness of fine tobaccos are
brought out to the full.

What they want, they have found in Chesterfiel

four years past, America’s fastest growing cigarette.

must be deserved
