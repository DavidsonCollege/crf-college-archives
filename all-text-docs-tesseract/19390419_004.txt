The Week In Review

Saturday afternoon the ‘Cat track, team came through
against V. P. I. to win 71-55 against the favored Gobbler ag-
gregation. All the cindermen put out extra-good performances
to down their rivals. The golfers came out sixth best in a field
of thirteen in the Athens, Ga., Southern Intercollegiate Tourna-
ment. Ray Pittman was third low in the qualifying rounds and
was only beaten after a hard match with Zacharias, who later
carried the champion to mighty good golfing to win, The ten-
nis team rested during the week, being rained out once, and
having other matches cancelled, Down at Furman the nine
took a tumble as “Roten the Ripper” Shetly limited the Cat
sluggers while his own mates backed him up well with scores
The next day at Wofford the’Cats turned the tables with Diz
on the mound, Diz claims he likes a high mound, and that this
one was considerably elevated. At any rate he was really right,
and the Davidsons grabbed off a 6-3 verdict over the Terriers.

Track Notes

Coach Whittle ran in a couple of new men to aid the
trackstars in their win over Virginia Tech. Bob Phipps
had only run one 440 before he copped the event in 55.3 sec-
onds. Besides that he placed in the broad jump, giving him
six points for the meet and showing Pete a new man to
work on for future contests. The other new man was Frank
Harrison, who came through in the 220 low hurdles. He
has not been on the track team before, but won the low
hurdles in the interfraternity meet. Charlie Sample, be-
side winning the pole vault with a leap of tw feet,
breezed the 100 in 10.1 seconds to win that event ‘and
add new laurels to his career. In the 880 yard’ run;*which
proved to be a dash in the stretch, Boo Walker turned on
the heat to win over Baldwin of V. P. I. This is the third
meet in a row that Davidson’s captain has won in the last
yards of the run. Fred Harbin had tough luck in the high
hurdles as he booted a hurdle, but Tom Cauble took second
place for Davidson. Saturday Swede Johnson is scheduled
to go under the knife for an operation on his ailing left el-
bow which will bench him for the season. The ’Cats will
miss the long heaves of Swede in the javelin throw.

Looking Golf Over

Wildcat linksmen entered their first tournament of the
season last week in the Southern Intercollegiate, winning sixth
team honors for the tourney. Previous to the meet they kept
their unbeaten team’record clear by defeating Citadel 12 1-2 to
5 1-2, then continued on to Athens, Ga, Ray Pittman pacéd the
golfers, being the only 'Cat mashie-wielder to qualify for the
first flight. He had third low in the pre-match qualifying
rounds. Incidentally the man who beat him, Zacharias of L.
S. U., made the winner shoot mighty low golf to. beat him.
Charley Pegram turned in an ace on the 151-yard No. 8 hole,
using a six iron for the hole-ifi-one.

Courts Need Care

It appears that the College should be able, and would
be willing to look after the tennis courts properly, so that
our tennis team could have good grounds to play and prac-
tice on. At present there are plenty of courts, but they
aren’t kept in good condition. The surface is bad, being
made of sand which tears up and scuffs easily. To play
top-flight tennis a man needs competition daily on fast
courts, such as he will see action on when away from the
college. Without daily watering, and the proper care of
the courts, they become soft and “dead” in spots, so that
the ball will not bounce true. Thus far the tennis team has
brought much recognition and publicity to the school
through its record, both on the tour through the South-
west, and after its return home. Only one team has suc-
ceeded in defeating them, and that was the ace net club of
Texas University, one of the best in the country. Besides
the varsity team, many men daily use the courts for prac-
tice and pleasure. There are enough of them, but more care
should be used in their upkeep. May we ask the committee
on Grounds or the athletic office to look into this?

Varsity Baseballers
Beat Wofford 6-3;
Lose To Furman 14-5

McLean Hurls Well to Set
Terriors Down; Hicks and
Steere Unable to Tame Slug-
ging Gamécocks; Duke
Wins Earlier Contest

Davidson's varsity baseball team
returned from a two-day invasion
of the south with a .500 percentage
Purple Hur-
14-5, but coming back
defeat Wofford, 6-3.

In the game, J. D.
Hicks, starting on the mound for
the Wildcats, was wild and
effective. The South Carolinians
three times in the first
frame on four hits and a walk, add-
ing a single marker in the third
and two in the fourth. Hicks was
hill in the
inning by Eddie Steere when Fur-
man gathered four runs on three
hits and two base on balls.

"Cats Set Down

Meanwhile, the Wildcats were
helpless before the hurling of Shet-
ly. Not until the fifth did they
score when Steere led off with a
Single, went to third on Hicks’ hit
and both tallied on Frank Niven’s
sharp drive to left. Shetly’s wild-
ness got him in trouble late in the
gang the big hurler forced
across single runs in the sixth, sev-
enth and eighth stanzas.

“Black Hunter, Eddie
Steere, and Frank Niven paced the
at bat with two
apiece, while Martin and Reid each
collected three bingles for Furman.

The Wofford fracas was quite a
different question. Dave McLean
the eight hits gathered
by the losers and had the situation
well in hand at all times. The Wof-
single runs in the
third, seventh, and eighth, mostly
because of walks by McLean.

Davidson Hits

Davidson bats, quiet during the
first three innings, came to life in
the fourth. Walter Fitzgerald open-
ed with a single and scored on Ed-
die Steere’s ponderous triple. Hicks’
brought Steere home with a time-
ly blow to left-center. Hicks scored

Helleckson’s infield roller.
