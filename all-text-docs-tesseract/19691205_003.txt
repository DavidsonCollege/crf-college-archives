TICKETS”

A new ticket policy has
heen instated this basket
ball seagOn at the request

of the Student Government
Association, according to Da
vidson Athletic Director ‘om
Scott.

Under the new policy, date
tickets will still be purchas-
ed in the gym for all games,
both at Charlotte and Da-
vidson, but student tickets
for the Charlotte games must
be picked up between. six
and eight the night. of the
game at the Coliseum.

Date tickets will be picked
up at the same time with
a receipt given by the tick-
et office at Johnston Gym.

Scott. said that the Stu-
dent Government — Associn-
tion requested “the new pol-
icy to make ticket sales more
equitable for all students,
He mentioned that the chief
reasons for the change were
the unfairness of the old
system for students with
niorning classes and the cif-
ficulty involved in getting
Seats together with friends.

“This will be a lot better
1 think,”’ said Scott, “It has
been made at the direct ve
quest of the Student Govern
Association. They ask
ed to set it up this way and I

ment

to do so."
President Peter Hobbie
said, “We know that there
would be complaints no mat-
ter how we did it, but we
thought this was the best

and fairest way possible.’
