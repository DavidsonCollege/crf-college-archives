Appropriately enough for a
sport that has been dominated re-
cently by events not directly re-
lated to the actual game itself, the
Davidson baseball team has a
heckuva time getting its season
started.

ACCORDING TO

SCHOON

The first attempt at a season
opener, on Feb. 11 against
Campbell, was postponed because
of weather, as was Wednesday’s
scheduled game against UNCC,
Thursday’s makeup of the
Campbell game and Friday’s
makeup of the UNCC game.

At least the delay was due to
weather, not players rising up and
declaring they should be paid more
and have to work less.

And so baseball fans here are
forced to go a few more days with-
out their favorite game.

Fans’ anger everywhere at
major league baseball has justifi-
ably intensified, evidenced by
President Clinton’s desire to get
involved and solve the now six-
month-long strike. Players seemed
even more peeved by the owners’
desire to fill teams with scab re-
placement players. And owners
are miffed that the players won’t
settle.

But despite all this madness,
there has been little, if any, move-
ment on either side to really get
down to work and solve this thing.

So, in their search of the game,
fans on this campus turned to

Hopes for baseball season look mirky at best.

Davidson’s season opener — only
to have to wait again.

“In the grand scheme of
things,” Davidson baseball coach
Dick Cooke said, “it’s way too
early to start baseball. But with the
academic schedule, we’re forced
to start this early.”

While the Wildcats have
fought snow and rain and cold
weather in their preparations for

the season, major league owners
and players have fought each other
with little resolution in sight.

Many people have theorized
about the’ damage to the game,
about how fans will be reluctant to
‘come back and about how the game
will never be the same again.

But that’s not true. And ev-
erybody who’s a baseball: fan
knows it.

Cats place in Charleston regatta

After opening its spring sea-
son with a strong showing at home
two weekends ago, the Davidson
sailing team ran into some tough
competition this weekend in a re-
gatta in Charleston and finished in
eighth place.

Up against seven teams ranked
in the top 20 in the nation in sail-
ing, the Wildcats had a signifi-
cantly less glamorous placing than
last weekend.

Davidson beat up on several other
teams.

But this weekend, College of
Charleston’s first team won the
regatta and its second team placed

third. Kings Point Merchant Ma- —

rine team was second. St. Mary’s
of Maryland was fourth, followed
by Dartmouth. All of those teams
are in the top 20, as is Texas A&M

(9th), Wisconsin (12th) and Yale |

(13th).

Dave Saudek and Brice Ivy manned
the other. In the B Division, Thu

“People will forget,” Cooke
says. “And they want to. Not to
overstate its importance, but the
game is a pretty important part of
. It'll take acouple
years, but I think the game will
rebound firfe.”

Yes, the people will come
again. But instead of coming with
hearts and minds filled with hopes
and dreams of how great baseball
could be, they will come with ap-
prehensions that players are still
making way too much money.
They willcome with attitudes based
on the knowledge that owners
would rather cancel the World Se-
ries than seek a realistic solution to
the problem.

“Not to trivialize this whole
thing,” Cooke says, “but the worst
thing about this is that Cal Ripken
could lose his (consecutive games
played) streak. And baseball is all
about history. More than any other
sport, baseball thrives on numbers,
stats and history. That’s what the
fans love. . . One of the greatest
streaks might come to an end, be-
cause of things the public can’t
understand.”

Using replacemt players is, of
course, a stupid idea. Major league
baseball should not be played by
anyone except major league play-
ers. And fans realize that.

They won’t flock to spring
training to watch players who were
never good enough to make it on
their own.

The beauty of spring training
has always rested in something
much beyond the actual game it-
self. It lies in the ability to watch a
game from good, cheap seats in
beautiful weather, knowing that
back at home, the weather is cold,

Baseball fields remain quiet

dismal and completely anti-base-
ball.

The beauty of spring training
rests in the availability of the play-
ers. It lies in the fact that you can
see the stars practice in the morn-
ing, play an exhibition in the after-
noon and walk freely among their
admirers following their five-in-
ning stint.

Chances of spring training,
which was supposed to start this
past week, taking place in all its
glory are about as good as Ken
Griffey Jr. actually chasing downa
fly ball all the way across the coun-
try as he does in that inane Nike
commercial.

And so we wait. And wait.
And wait. And nobody knows
how much longer we’ll have to
wait. Maybe another week. Or
maybe another six months.

And based on this week’s
weather, even the college players
might not take the field for a while.

“Tt wouldn’t stun me to leave
to gohome tonight to hear it’s been
settled and that they’ll start spring
training in three days,” Cooke says.

An irony of all this is that one
day we might actually learn the
details of the different plans and
figure out why a grown man can
not live ona million dollars a year.

But we, the average fan, will
probably never figure it out. We
won’tunderstand. And we’ll prob-
ably be better off not understand-
ing, because that would only anger
us more, _

Perhaps if we took Cooke's
view of the whole thing, we could
find whatever inner peace we might
be looking for.

Says he: “I think everybody’s
stupid.”
