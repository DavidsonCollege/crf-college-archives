Books Grow
As Library
Is Expanded

Since 1837 Library Has Grown
From Nothing To Many
Copies

By HENRY McINTOSH

Construction of Davjidson’s
$150,000 library, which will be-
gin within the next few weeks,
adds another chapter to the
colorful history of the college’s

growth.
When the college was founded
in 1837 there was no library or

even a collection of books provided
for the students other than those
furnished by various members of
the. faculty. But April 14, 1837,
the Polemic Debating Society, now
known as the Eumenean Society,
was organized, and the following
June the Philanthropic Society held
its first meeting. Soon these two
societies, in competition with one
another, ‘organized libraries to “let
out books two days a week at or
before 8 A. M.”
Collection Grew

These collections grew rapidly,
that in 1839 the

borrowed $50
on the “faith of the Society to add
to the books” then stored
in Professor Sparrow's class room.
They also borrowed $500 in 1858
for the of additional
hooks. However, a year previous to
this loan, tlfey attempted to “purify”
library by burning all the

.By 1860 the college owned about

were combined, giving a
total of about nine thousand volum-

together in» a» room, thirty-five: by

with no conception of modern lib-

months the “librarian wore a muf-
fler and rubber shoes and kept the

Carnegie Gift

In 1909 Andrew Carri€gie
$20,000 for the library along with
an endowment of $20,000 more. The
ground for this building was’ brok-
en in September 1909, the building
being completed in June of the fol-
lowing year. ;

Library Vote

There will be a special regis-
tration at Henderson's Jewelry
Store, that will be open until
May 11 for. voting upon opening
the Charlotte and Mecklenburg
County Library. Voting will take

place on May 25.

Due to the fact that persons
registering and not voting count
against reopening, the first vote
turned down libraries for Char-
lotte and the county.

This is not merely a Charlotte
municipal election, as many peo-
ple seem to think, but it is a
county question. Since the vote
is passive (those not voting are
counted as voting against) those
interested are: urged to give the
matter consideration.
