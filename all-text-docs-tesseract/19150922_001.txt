During the past week or so Coach

Fetzer has been giving the foot ball
squad as good a work out as the con-
tinued spell of hot weather will permit,
and the effect of the work has been
clearly evident in the scrimmages that
have been held within the past few days.

There is some good material to be
found among the new men, and all of
them are showing up well in the prac-
tices. It is as yet impossible to definitely
pick the men who will be found in the
various positions in the opening game of
the season, which will be the contest
with Washington & Lee, in Lexington.

Among the letter men who have re-

turned are: Keesler, Laird, Steve
Walker, Black, Bob Walker, and
White. Laird and Walker have been

working out in the back field, White at
tackle, Miller at center, Keesler, Ives
Lawson at quarter, Adams at guard,
Black at half, Bob Walker at end, Grey
and Finlev at tackle, and Savad at guard,
while Hill, Fowle and Steve Walker
also have been doing the punting.

Among the new men Younger _ is
showing up well at end, McGill at
guard, King at end, and Dean at half.

A good strong scrub team has also
been developed. and this will of course

e of great help in rounding the team
into shape and giving it a good opposi-
tion against which to work.

On Friday the regular varsity team
and the substitutes will leave for Lex-
ington for the game with Washington
& Lee, which will open the season.

Reports from the camp of the Blue
and White are to the effect that a
speedy, strong team is being put out
again this vear, and a hard fought game
is expected.

Of the Varsitv team of last year, Cap-
tain Schultz, Brvant. Izard. Harrison.
Graham. Pierotti. Sweetland and “Cy”
Young have returned. Among the new
men who have reported are to be found
some promising high school and prep
school players, and there are also a num-
ber of men on the last vear’s scrub team
that are showing up well. From this
material Head Coach Elcock and Assist-
ants Donahue and Raftery are develop-
ing a strong line and a speedy back field.

Knowing that Washington & Lee has
always put out a strong aggregation, the
Davidson squad is going up with a de-
termination to give their opponents a

ulty Assures a Successful Year.

The Davidson High School opened.

September 2 with an enrollment of two
hundred pupils. and quite a number have
entered since. “Phe faculty has an addi-
tion of another teacher. Of the former
faculty Misses Hood, Withers, Jetton.
and Johnson, and Professor Cumming
are welcomed by patrons and citizens.
The new members of the faculty are
Miss Annie Jones, of Greenwood, S. C..
who comes here highly qualified and rec-
ommended: and Miss Maude Vinson. of
Davidson, who last vear conducted a
private school here for girls. “Phe fac-
ulty and patrons are justly proud of the
new additions.

The Primary department ‘meets at the
home of its teacher, Miss Withers. Pro-
fessor Cumming has adopted a new plan

grades, that is. the system of entrance
examinations. This is something new
for this school, and will, it is hoped.
meet with great success. Another im-
provement is an effort.to make the sur-
roundings more attractive. The play
ground has been nlowed and ts soon to
be put in grass. This will add wonder
fully to the appearance:

Much interest is being shown and the
children are again. glad to be in school
after a long. pleasant and eventful va-
cation. Professor Cumming states that
the enrollment and work show marked
improvement: and that the prospect is
bright for making this one of the best
and most successful years of the high
school.

enrolled. It is hoped that the number
mav be yet increased, and also that at
tendance records may be broken. “This
record of attendance, and the class per
centages will be posted cachWweek on the

Tennis Tournament

Begins ist of October

Association President and Manager
Chosen and Plans Perfected.

At a recent meeting of the Davidson
College “Tennis Association plans were
mide for the Fall tournament. and the
following officers were elected: A. B.
Reese, president; T. A. Finley, manager.
The committee appointed to get the
names of those entering and to arrange
the schedule of the tournament was R.
G. Finley, W. P. Keesler and J. R.
Woods. All entries must be in by 6:30
p.m. Monday, September 27. The
tournament starts the following Friday,
October AK “The doubles will be played
off first. Every one entering must. de-
posit 25 cents to pay for the halls which,
according to custom, will go to the win-
ner of the match. At the conclusion of
the doubles the singles will be plaved off.

The association is trying to secure
three courts, the Championship, the
court in the grove, and probably one of
the new ones, if it can be gotten in god
condition by that time. This will allow
nine matches to-he plaved off each even-
ine.

A large number of men have already
handed in their names, and a good many
more are expected to enter. The tour-
nament is open ta any one who plays
tennis. All that is necessary is to hand
in your name to. a member af the com-
niittec.

TT. A. Finley. the manager, states that
as vet he has been unable to secure any
inter-collegiate games for the year, but
will probably have about three or four,
ane of which will be staged on the Hill.

CLASS BASKET BALL.

Great interest is already being mani-
fested in the class basket hall season
which opens shortly. Last vear great in-
terest was taken in these games, and as
this year’s contest precedes the regular
hasket hall season, the struggle will be
greater and the interest keener since
much of the varsity material must be
chosen from these class reams. Every
afternoon a good number of men repre-
senting the several classes hold regular
practice on the outdoor court.

The Seniarn and Junior classes will be
represented by practically the same teams
as last year. The Sophs tose — Billie
Howell, who failed to return to college.
Tt is impossible to prophesy the strength
of the Fresh team, but from the material
reporting for practice it looks as if they
will make a good struggle for the cham-
pionship.

Of last vear’s Varsity squad Henge-
veld, Wood, Childs, Reese and Carson
have returned. and the prospects for a
good basket ball team look encouraging.

The schedule of games and the dates
of play have not been arranged bv the
class managers. but they will seon be
chosen and their respective schedules will
he announced.

At recent class meetings the following
managers were elected: Seniors, G. B.
Hovt: Tuniors. W. FE. Mattison: Sophs,
Fred Hengeveld.

By unanimous vote the Fumenean So-
ciety at its first meeting discontinued the
usual) “horseplav” in their initiatory
ceremonies.
