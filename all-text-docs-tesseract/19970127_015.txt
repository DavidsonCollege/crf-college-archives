Abra cadabra, Ali serves up Ton of assists

Ali’s assists

Pinpoint passer Ali Ton has
been on a torrid assist run recently,
picking up 31 in the last three
games.

A cCa-
reer-high 12
Wednesday
vs. East
Tenn. St.
raised his”
season aver-
age to a hair
under seven
per game.

- It also
vaulted Ton past Marshall’s Sidney
Coles into the Southern Confer-
ence top spot and to 12th in the

nation.

Why the sudden explosion?

“He’s got’ people: finishing
shots, he’s got people catching his
passes, he’s got people running to
catch his passes, and he sees the
court really well,” said coach Bob
McKillop after the ETSU win.

“That’s just Ali. He almost

passes to a fault,” added Mark’

Donnelly, whose silky .jumpers
have played a big role in Ton’s
assist totals. 3

“He’s absolutely incredible in
what he sees. Sometimes we look
at him like he’s crazy, but when he
has nights like this, maybe we
should stop looking at him so funny
when he is trying to explain to us
what he is trying to do.”

Still ‘though, McKillop be-
lieves Ton has considerable room

for improvement before he ulti-
mately reaches his potential, point-
ing out that he often tries to do too
much and notjust make the simple,
safer pass.

“He’s a better see-er than a
passer,” remarked the coach.
“When he becomes a better passer,
watch out.”

Younger Kosmalski mak-
ing his own mark

Three days after running a fea-
ture article on him, The Observer
called rookie Landry Kosmalski
“Len” in the ETSU report.

Such a slip could be viewed as
a compliment, considering Len
Kosmalski, Landry’s father, was
a standout at Tennessee and went
on to play for the Chicago Bulls
and Kansas City Kings inthe NBA.

But Kosmalski has made an
immediate impact in his own right
this season, creating an identity as
aruthless rebounder (7.8 per game,
3rd in the SC) and versatile, reli-
able scorer
(12.8, 14th).

His 18-
point, 7-re-,
bound per- —
formance
against
South Divi-
sion leader
UTC Jan. 18

prompted
Mocs superstar Johnny Taylor to
predict, “He’s going to tear this
conference up”

And after a 23-point, 10-re-
bound double-double in the App.
St. loss, Mountaineers coach Buzz
Peterson had nothing but praise
for No. 40.

“I was at Vanderbilt and he
was akid I wanted to recruit,” said
the first-year coach who was an
assistant at Vandy last season.

“T thought he could help us in

the SEC. I thought he was smart,
he ran the floor awful hard, he had
nice touch. To me, he’s one of the
better freshman in this league. I’ve
always been a big Landry
Kosmalski fan.”

But the humble and soft-spo-
ken Kosmalski, who will routinely
sacrifice his body for the team,
taking charges and diving out of
bounds for loose balls, always
chooses to dwell on his few mis-
takes during postgame interviews
rather than point out his many suc-
cesses. :

“Numbers-wise, I am playing
well,” he said after the App. St.
game. “But I know my defense js
pathetic and I am not getting
enough rebounds. That's what
coach and I have been working on
recently.”

As Donnelly said though,
“He’s a big reason why we’re a lot
better than people thought we were
going to be.” ~ :

Holmes breaks out of mini-
slump

Coming into this season, one
of the many questions facing the
youthful Wildcats was how sopho-
more Chadd Holmes would per-
form in the pivot.

As expected, the 6-9 Holmes
has had his ups and downs, bad
games and good games.

But perhaps none more im-
portant than his 14-point, 8-re-
bound effort vs. ETSU. Going into
the game against the Bucs, Holmes
had posted only 9 points and 8
boards in his previous twocontests
combined.

Wednesday’s outing was just
what the doctor ordered: aseverely-

boost.

“The
4 big thing
with Chadd
is just be-
lieving in
himself,”
Saad
Donnelly af-
ter the

ETSU game...

“Tonight he showed what he
is capable of doing every night, in
my opinion.”

“Chadd certainly stepped it
up tonight with aggression,” said a
pleased McKillop. “He sat down,
he looked at film, he did a lot of
soul-searching. There was a great
deal of introspection on his part,
and he made a determination that
he is going to change:

“He’s not going to be passive.
He’s not going to be put on his
heels, and tonight he certainly in-
stigated rather than retaliated. And
that’s been a problem, he’s been

the retaliator rather than the insti-
gator.”
Tonight’s game should pose a
challenging individual matchup for
Holines, as he goes up against The
Citadel’s 7-foot shot-blocking

Misyuchenko.

Injury report

Stephen Marshall, who
sprained his left ankle Jan. 18 vs.
UTC, was in street clothes at App.
St. and dressed for ETSU, but never
played and was still walking witha
noticeable limp. But the 6-8 for-
ward, a vital body off the bench in
the frontcourt rotation, is set to
return tonight against The Citadel.

“T believe he’ll be ready,” said
McKillop on Wednesday. “(Team
doctor) Scott Applegate has done
such a great job for us throught the
year, and I’m sure he’ll have him
ready for the Citadel game.”...

Donnelly suffered a cut below
his right eye late in the first half at
App. St., which required stitches
and caused him to miss some of the
second half.

But the injury obviously did
not effect his shot at all on Wednes-

day, as he made six threes and shot
10-for-12 from the floor. The only
worry now is that the five-day lay-
off between ETSU and tonight’s
contest in Charleston, S.C., will
cool off his stroke.

In the zone

McKillop used a 2-3 zone de-
fense in both games this week -
very uncharacteristic for a coach
who preaches tough man-to-man
pressure.

“We did it three years ago and

‘that was about the last time we

used it,” McKillop said Wednes-
day.

“We've been forced to use it
this year. We’ve been forced to
make adjustments.”

The zone forces team to shoot
the long-range jumper, and while
App. St.’s Tige Darner burned the
Wildcats Monday with eight threes,
it worked well against ETSU, as
the Bucs shot just over 30% from
beyond the arc.
