War breaks out in the world of IMAC BBall

By BAD BERNARD
and BONEHEAD

The ground was covered with
lumps of bloody flesh. The roar
- of tanks could be heard in the
distant background. The groans
of agony were deafened by the
periodic bombings of the savage
warplanes in the darkened,
smoke-covered sky.

What is the cause of this ‘suf.
fering? Is this the Russians
invading Czechoslavakia? No!

Hitler invading Poland? No!
M ini attacking Ethiopia?
No! This bloody scene is the
culmination of the long, gruel-
ing struggle of the Davidson
People’s Party, alias Cool
Breeze, against the bourgeoisie.

Party spokesman Billy Earl
Johnson said “The Revolution
was inevitable. Once the suffer-
ing masses (me, Mickey, Brian,
James, and Kevin) joined hands
there was no way for the elite
capitalist pigs to stay in
power.”

The Revolution began when
Cool Breeze jumped up on the
side of the head of Bye. Hanna
said, “There was no way that

_ we were gonna keep runnin’ the
machines and let the other
dudes rake in the money.’’ Bye
fell from within. It was later
discovered that several kéy
players were card-bearing Com-
munists.

In the other bracket, the
SAE’s were sabotaged as sever-
al their starting players were
assassinated or placed in prison
camps and forced to miss the
game with the Tuts. (Bad

Bernard wrote. this ridiculous
statement. It should be noted

Ee

by Bonehead that Hill Stock-
ton, standout -floor general for
the frosh was missing in action
several days before the battle.)
Nevertheless, many feel that
those alligator toting bastards
got what they deserved.

After the coup de tat had
taken place, a new group of
elites came to power before the
Tut monarchy had a chance to
blossom. This was the facist
government, Old Men.

The stage was now set for
confrontation. Would we have a
repressive government run by
elites or a fair and just govern-
ment run by the people? Cool
Breeze gave quick response to _
this question. Outnumbered al-
most two to one, the brothers of
the People’s Party, Cool Breeze,
opened up a can of Whipass and
overthrew the tyrants. The
dialectic had now run its course,
just as Karl Marx predicted in
my history notebook.

In the minor leagues: The Big
Daddy’s Conosco Family ruled
with an iron hand. On its way to
victory it bumped out several
weaker enemies whose names
could not be released to the
press for reasons not in our
control.

In the women’s league the
eventual winner emerged and
captured the tourney.

We also need to report that
several records have been bro-
ken during the first two weeks
of the term in which the
sub-solar point of the sun hits

. the equator causing the vernal

equinox.

David Vaugn, senior Phi-
. Delt, smashed the existing Out-
door Suorts Event Obnoxious

nant eats “Speen (Greoo Strader).

Comment Record when he hurl-
ed fifteen expletives at the
Gilford team. °

Rob Cordell set a new Out-
door Beer Consumption record
as he tallied 152 beverages in
six days enabling him to be-
come a member of the Century
Club, the tree club, and pee
club.

Mike Sheridan, senior foot-
ball captain, ran the Twelve
Beer: Medley in an unprece-
dented one hour and 46 min-
utes. He was not seen after that
for two days.

Kelvin Anderson, freshman
son of trustee H. Perrin Ander-
son, set a record of running the
campus obstacle course in two
and a half days. The course
consisted of climbing five trees,
eating a small bush, raping two
dogs, and drinking a 6-pack
from at least a dozen varieties of
beers. Kelvin was found dead in
his smoke-filled room early
Monday morning and was
buried in Dean Terry’s Office
Tuesday. Friends and relatives
should send cards and flowers
to the Mt. Mourne 200.
