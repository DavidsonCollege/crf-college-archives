Dixie’s Calvinists

Some years ago Charles A. Beard
brought forth a faith-shaking interpreta-
tion of the constitution of the United
States which, in brief, laid claims to the
fact that our founding fathers had their
own economic and social interests at heart
when they drew up the document which
has been revered since 1789 as the ground
upon which the government of the great-
est of all nations was founded. In the
midst of an age of theoretical idealism
which surrounded the document Mr.
Beard made the heretical claim that,
knowingly or not, the fathers of our coun-
try had their own interests at heart in
drawing up the Constitution.

We shall not go further into Mr. Beard,
but would like by a stretch of the imagi-
nation to apply somewhat of the same
kind of thinking in getting to the base
of the question of Presbyterian (re)union.
Much have we read in recent months of
eternal verities concerning the question.
We find that the northern Presbyterians
are ‘unsound’ doctrinally, that they don’t
give like we give, that they are losing
churches, and, as a whole, that we are
more worthy than they are. Never can
physical union be successful until a spirit-
ual union has been attained, we are told.

And how right this last statement is.
But the spiritual union, in spite of all
the high flown terms used to describe it,
really has very little to do with the spirit
of Jesus Christ. It is actually a spiritual
union which will come only when church-
men in the south cease to consider them-
selves a separate people in a promised

land and begin to realize that the thought
patterns of the Confederacy are well out-
dated and that too often we are prone
to back a peculiarly reactionary philoso-
phy of life by calling our sectional feel-
ings the eternal verities of God. Chris-
tlanity, it appears, is crushed unmerciful-
ly into the cocked hat of a little mold of
thinking that is so outdated as to kill the
very dynamic faith which it so loudly
professes.

The faith of the southern Presbyterian
is one with the faith of the northern
Presbyterian. The purpose of the church-
es is one. Both proclaim the gospel of
Jesus Christ, a gospel of unity and love
instead of division and competition.

Let us investigate our reasons for our
outspoken protection of our ‘peculiar’
church. Do we base our fight against
union on the Gospel, or are we knowingly
or not proclaiming that the southern
mind is out of concord with the national
mind and that that mind has convinced it-
self that it is right and that everyone
else is wrong.

Lest we become blind to our duty by
looking too fondly at the ghosts of the
Confederacy, let us remember the well-
wrought words of William James concern-
ing Rome, a city with a past nearly as
great as that of the south: “The weight
of the past world here is fatal—one ends
by becoming its mere parasite instead of
its equivalent. The ancients did things
by doing the business of their own day,
not by gaping at their grandfathers tombs,
and a normal man today will do likewise.”

On Taming a Zealot

In spite of box upon box of signatures
coming from the austere top-brass organi-
zation “Ten Million Americans Mobilizing
for Justice”, the Senate has finally re-
gained some dignity by taking a top-heavy
stand to ce joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.)
on the first two of three counts. Monkey-
wrenches thrown by members to slow
down or stop procedures having failed in
their purpose, the Senate finally realized
that the elections were over and that it
was time to take some positive action
about the man who has made a laughing
stock of the most dignified of legislative
bodies and who has brought the United
States to a greater fear of Fascism than
she has experienced in recent times.

For a man who has made such a mock-
ery of freedom, while all the while claim-
ing to protect it, some curbing of slan-
derous conduct and accusations was neces-
sary. In a word, his method is as bad as
that of the very thing which he is fighting
—a method of ‘purging’ opposing ele-
ments whoever they may be, and of using
any method necessary to destroy all op-
position, hiding all the while behind a
cloak of ‘Americanism’ a doctrine which,
if made effective, would end the life of
America as we know it. To put his most
patriotic program across with the methods

he has used would be to burn down the
house of freedom to get rid of a few rats
dwelling in the basement. Surely there
must be a better answer than this to the
problem of Communism.

McCarthy has been of no mean value
to the American nation. He has aroused
us to realization of the danger of Com-
munism, and along with others has up-
turned evidence pointing to the pervasive
force of the Russian religion in even the
high places of our country.

But the man himself has become a
greater immediate menace than that
which he fights. His flinging of accusa-
tions and epithets, his incrimination of
many organizations which simply dared
to criticise him, his personal attacks on
members of the Senate—these are signs
which point to the fact that the junior
senator from Wisconsin is as much con-
cerned about himself as he is about a
fight on Communism. And we believe
even more so. The censure came none
too soon, none too soon to make the peo-
ple realize that when they cast a vote
against McCarthy they are not voting for
Communism but rather for their own
right to live and think with the demo-
cratic freedom upon which our country
was bullt.

“UN” ... But Not the Other

Way back when, somewhere around
the fifth grade, I remember an unusual
teacher. She was not only smart, but al-
so intelligent.

But it took until now for me to ap-
preciate her exacting meticulousness
about words. She taught English. She in-
sisted not only on the exact word at all
times, but also on the exact prefix or suf-
fix on every word that had one or the oth-
er.

She would know how to handle the
present confusion, misinterpretation, and
downright stubborn misunderstanding.
But, alas, she lies dead, buried under the
weight of misused, misleading prefixes.

Yes, she would have solved every-
thing. She would have changed the name
of the House Un-American Activities Com-
mittee. You see, to her, being un-Ameri-
can (what ever that is) and being anti-

American would be two quite different
things.
As I said, she was also intelligent. She
would next have obliged every good
American, nay, every American, to carry
his dictionary wherever he went if he did
not already kupw it by heart.

——Jim Dygert in the Michigan Daily
(University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). From
the Associated Collegiate Press.

When we consider how America
stands among the nations of the world,
and how we, able to be College Students,
compare even to many people in Ameri-

ca, we can but realize that a dip into our
hamburger and cigarette money for the
Gift Fund to Greece is a small price to
pay for being stewards of the greatest
material and spiritual inheritance known
to the world.

WATCH FOR WORMWOOD

At Davidson we hear quite a
bit about the state of our religious
growth. Perhaps no other weak-
ness in this period of our lives, the
college years, is as prevalent as
that of being unconcerned with ap-
plying a yardstick accurately to
our growth. Often we simply do
not make the effort to relate our
beliefs with our actions, and so we
lose sight of how far along we real-
ly are — which may not be far at
all.

C. S. Lewis has a classic in The
Serewtape Letters. This book is a

-s . series of letters
written by
a. Screwtape (an
official in Hell)
to Wormwood,
his nephew, who
is a junior devil
on earth. The
. letters are in-
Eee structions  tell-
.” s ing Wormwood
BU Scholl how to convert

a human being,
who is in danger of becoming -a
Christian, to the devil. In this satire
Lewis fairly sparkles, and in a few
selected passages I would have him
speak for himself.

Concerning Prayer ..

“ ,.. keep the patient from the
serious intention of praying alto-
gether. When the patient is an
adult recently re-converted to the
Enemy’s party, like your man, this
is best done by encouraging him
to remember, or to think he re-
members, the parrot-like nature
of his prayers in childhood. In
reaction against that, he may be
persuaded to aim at something
entirely spontaneous, inward, in-
formal, and unregularised; and
what this will actually mean to a
beginner will be an effort to pro-
duce in himself a vaguely devo-
tional mood in which real concen-
tration of will ami intelligence
have no part.”

BY BILL SCHOLL

On Inflvences of Other Humans

“I was delighted to hear from
Triptweeze that your patient has
made some very desirable new ac-
quaintances and that you seem to
have used this event in a really
promising manner, I gather that
the middle-aged married couple
who called at hipoffice are just the

sort of people we want him to.

know — rich, smart, superficially
intellectual, and brightly sceptical
about everything in the world. I
gather they are even vaguely paci-
fist, not on moral grounds but
from an ingrained habit of belitt-
ling anything that concerns the
great mass of their fellow men
and from a dash of purely fashion-
able and literary communism. This
is excellent ... No doubt he must
very soon realize that his own faith
is in direct opposition to the as-
sumptions on which all the conver-
getion of his new friends is based.
1 don’t think that matters much
provided that you can persuade
him to postpone any open acknowl-
edgment of the fact, and this, with
the aid of shame, pride, modesty
and vanity, will be easy to do.”
Of The Patient’s Misconception
Of His Stete
“Obviously you are making ex-
cellent progress. My only fear is
least in attempting to hurry the
patient you awaken him to a sense
of his real position. For you and
I (sic), who see that position as
it really is, must never forget how
totally different it ought to appear
to him. We know that we have in-
troduced a change of direction in
his course which is already carry-
ing him out of his orbit around
the Enemy; but he must be made
to imagine that all the choices
which have effected this change of
course are trivial and revocable.
He must not be allowed to suspect
that he is now, however slowly,
heading right away from the sun
on a line which will carry him into

What Others Are Saying About...

. SEGREGATION

From Sullins College
Bristol, Virginie

“All men are created equal.” A
concise and definite interpretation
of this phrase from our Declara-
tion of Independence has yet to be
formed. Our forefathers wrote
that all men are equal, but how
did they mean this? Surely the
people of America cannot assume
that we are all equal. Equality
means sameness in measure, quan-
tity, and degree. We have only to
look around us to see that inequali-
ty of wealth, social position and
class rank exists. A list of inequal-
ities in our United States would be
almost endless.

The problem of segregation is
one that affects everyone of us,
regardless of what section of the
country we are from. As a body
of students here at Sullins, we are
rather indirectly associated with
this problem, due to the fact that
Sullins is a privately owned, non-
denominational institution. On the
other hand, each of us is directly
concerned with this major prob-

lem in regard to our own particu:

lar city and state. This problem is
one that cannot be solved with a
yes or no answer. A solution can
come about only through clear
thinking and an objective attitude.
What will the answer be? As long
as prejudices and false ideals ex-

ist, so will segregation.

In the next generation, our chil-
dren will be influenced by our own
prejudices and beliefs. It seems,
then, that the only possible solu-
tion to this problem {s to attack
the source of the sore spot—unse-
gregated public schools and un-
equal economic opportunities.

Let us, with the help of God,
Jearn not just the meaning of tol-
eration, but the meaning of love
—love for our fellow man. Our fel-
low man is not only the man next
door, but the man on the back of
the bus, and the little Negro girl
who shares her lollipops with your
kid sister. (Sullins Reflector).

And The Associated
Collegiate Presse

... Read the newspaper accounts
of race riots in the newly inte-
grated schools. Rarely will you
find difficulty arising from be-
havior of children. Most of the
trouble is plotted by “indignant”
parents who are displaying their
ignorance and narrowmindedness
and, at the same time, are depriv-
ing their offspring of a sound edu-
cation ... It is the parents who
instigate school strikes, not the
children. Teaching of the princl-
ples of the equality of men and
equal opportunity for all must be-
gin in the home. (Dally Atheneeum
of the University of West Virginia)

the cold and dark of utmost space.

“For this reason I am almost
glad to hear that he is still a
churchgoer and a communicant. I
know there are dangers in this;
but anything is better than that he
should realize the break he has
made with the first months of his
Christian life. As long as he re-
tains externally the habits of a
Christian he can still be made to
think of himself as one who has
adopted a few new friends and
amusements but whose spiritual
state is much the same as it was
six weeks ago. And while he thinks
that, we do not have to contend
with the explicit repentance of a
definite, fully recognized, sin, but
only with his vague, though un-
easy, feeling that he hasn’t been
doing very well lately.”

Such words are a challenge to
anyone who would examine him-
self with the utmost scrutiny, and
who wants to develop himself
through wrestling with questions
of the most profound nature—
questions which are applicable to
all men and remind us of our bro-
therhood with every man on earth.
At Davidson too often the cry
rings true that we are concerned
with local matters in such a way
as to bog down and lose sight of
all purpose and slur over great in-
tellectual problems which could
educate us as we never dared hope,
would we but make the effort.
But, of course, “education” literal-
ly means a “leading out,” and per-
haps we're too settled in medio-
crity to want to come out — be-
cause it would mean carrying a
cross,

Wisdom of the Ages?

Dr. James H. Thornwell was
the outstanding preacher of the
Southern Presbyterian Church
before the War between the
States. In 1838, in an addresss
to the students of Davidson Col-
lege, he had this to say with
respect to the Abolitionists:

“And if their leveling pro-
pensities should gradually bring
them to the hated doctrine of
amalgamation, reason, religion
and humanity as well as decen-
cy and taste would turn away
in disgust from the sickening
am of outrageous fanatic-

m.””

Ivy League Expert!

Dear Editor:

I was fortunate enough to ob-
tain recently copies of your pa-
per in which a letter from Tom
Firor and a rebuttal to it from
Gilbert Gragg appeared.

In this age of universal enlight-
enment, provincialism is a serious
accusation. I am sure Mr. Firor
was not jesting when he attacked
you. For this reason alone I was
shocked by the flippant reply of
Mr. Gragg to the allegation.

I must therefore assume one of
two things; either that the David.

tonian accepts the role of bump- -

kin mediocrity relegated to it by
Mr. Firor without so much as a
whimper, or that in your hauteur
you do not even consider Mr. Fir-
or’s excellent letter worthy of an
intelligent reply.

Surely one could expect a more
mature viewpoint from a college
newspaper.

Mental Breakdown:
What Is Our Part?

BY LEIGHTON McCUTCHEN

As we entered the gate, it look-
ed as if we were visiting the
grounds of a private college. The
large buildings were located on a
high-point of rolling green land,
completely enclosed by vari-color-
ed trees. The first sign of abnor-
mality came as we walked toward
the main building, for bebind
many large barred windows sat the
apathetic figures of people labeled
and pigeon-holed by their fellow
man as—insene.

This was the state mental hos-
pital at Morganton, and we were a
visiting group of “Psych” students
—outsiders coming to observe
what many of us thought to be a
different species of human; this
even though the “book” had said
that the sickness of these people
was neither mysteriously shame-
ful nor totally incurable. Only as
we talked with the patients did
we come to see the truth of this
fact.

The hospital has 2700 patients—
ranging in degree of sickness from
those that were soon to be releas-
ed as normal, to those in the back
wards which seem hopelessly and
chronically psychotic. There is an
amazing turnover of five-hundred
persons each six months — leaving
due to being “cured,” paroled to
society, or dying, and coming in
for an equal variety of reasons.

Contectl

At first we self-consciously “‘pa-
raded” through some of the wards.
We were amazed to learn later
that though most of the patients
looked to be from the lowest so-
cio-economic class of people, they
had held prior to. their commit-
ment such a variety of roles as doc-
tors, ministers, common laborers,
and business people. Some of the
things that we saw were not pleas-
ant — again the apathetic window
sitters — men lying about on the
floor of the hall — those patients
requiring seclusion sitting imobile
turned toward the wall with only
a quilt around their bodies — oth-
ers grinning foolishly at the door
of their necessarily bare cells — a
young girl pleasantly asking us
not to kill ourselves in her pres-
ence — the recreational therapist
trying to get an overwhelming
number (about two hundred) to
participate in play of various kinds
with amazing success, though of
course many were left untouch-
ed—

Some of the wards were spoken

Letters To The Editor

of as being better, that is having
more congenial patients in them,
but even the worse ones were
amazingly clean and neat consid-
ering the condition of the patients
confined therein. Many of the pa-
tients talked affably with us. Most
of them expressed the desire to
leave the place claiming sanity
with such sane arguments that they
were rather convincing at first
hearing. Some did seem to be there
because they were an exaggerated
nuisance to their families, but oth-
ers gave every evidence of the val-
idity of their committment.

Some Reactions

The most impressive fact to me
was the realization that here were
people who were sick in mind,
many of whom could be returned
to society as normally functioning
personalities. This destroyed the
notion, of course, of the enevitable
permanency of abnormality, and
also the idea that there is an easi-
ly recognizable line between the
normal and the abnormal.

The second new conception that
T gained was that much of the re-
sponsibility for those people in
Morganton falls not just on those
few dedicated staff members serv-
ing there, but on me as well, It
does so on two accounts; first as
1 contribute (through ignorance)
in interpersonal relationships to
the “breakdown” of individuals
around me; and secondly as I am
unaware of the fact that many of
those people already committed to
an asylum could regain adequacy
in society if there were enough
psychologists, psychiatrists and in-
terested donors to furnish wise in-
dividual therapy and equipment to
get at these persons.

The number of patients for
which each professional staff mem-
ber at Morganton is responsibile
is overwhelming. They can give
potentially effective (i.e. total)
therapy to those just entering the
institution. There is neither money
nor personne] for the pains-taking
job with the “chronics” in the back
wards,

What a challenge for those not
blinded by the goal of financial se-
curity and the promise of an ‘easy
Job; the challenge is to work in
the exciting frontier science of
psychology while losing yourself
in the service of making men
whole again.

Davidsonian Called Tool of ROTC

Dear Sirs:

We are sick and tired of contin-
ually seeing so many articles in
“The Davidsonian” on ROTC.
Couldn't this space be used for
more interesting and valuable sub-
jects? If you are going to give such
coverage to one subject, shouldn't
you give it to all? Instead of writ-
ing on members of the ROTC De-

partment why don’t you write on
other members of the faculty?
Why doesn't the ROTC Depart-

ment inaugurate its own news-
paper for those who are interested
in reading about ROTC. Many of
us are not interested in reading
about ROTC.

Sincerely,

Some Readers.

Student Contends Discussions
Have Not Been One-sided In Past

Dear Editor:

This letter is written in reply to
a letter which appeared in the
Devidsonien on November 12 com-
posed by three members of the
student body. Their letter contains
in it a plea for a non-partisan,
two-sided discussion of any impor-
tant controversy dealt with here
on the campus. To this plea I
would like to add my own name.
Never can intelligent discussions
of controversial issues be had un-
less both sides are allowed to pre-
sent their viewpoints. We must
work with open and not narrow
minds.

But as to the particular ques-
tions mentioned by these students
in their letter there seems to be an
error to me. The “vital questions”
specified were church union and
racial segregation. It is claimed
that neither of these questions has
been presented fairly from both
sides. Possibly this is true of
chapel. If so, that fact should be
remedied immediately. As long as
chapel is compulsory it is only fair
that both sides of any controversy
be presented.

To my knowledge in the past
three years there have been only
two programs on Presbyterian re-
union. Both of these were put on
by the Westminster Fellowship
last May. The first program was

merely a presentation of the Plan
for union presented by Dr. C. K.
Brown. The second was a debate
held in the ballroom of the Col-
lege Union with an audience of be-
tween 160 and 200 people. Dr.
James A. Jones presented the pro-
union side, and Dr. Charles Me-
Clure ‘presented the anti-union
side. Both of these Charlotte min-
isters were well-qualified to de-
bate this question, and they handl-
ed it capably.

This past October the Westmin-
ster Fellowship also presented two
programs on segregation. These
were led by students. Here again
both sides of the question were
given equal opportunity to present
their viewpoints. Time for general
discussion was also allowed. Both
the programs on segregation and
reunion were publicized ahead of
time.

This letter is not written to pro-
voke an argument but to show that
there are places and opportunities
on the Davidson: campus to hear
controversial issues fairly discuss-
ed and to have opinions formulat-
ed. Let us hope that this will con-
tinue. to be true of a Christian,
democratic school such as David .

son,
Sincerely,
Pat Miller
