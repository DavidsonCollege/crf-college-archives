Norton Sees Hair Business Thinning

’ By BILL BARNES
Staff Writer

Kenneth Norton is a barber.

His father was also a barber.-So was
his father-in-law and so was his
cousin. In fact, barbering has been in
Ken Norton’s family for a century.
Ken himself has been at it thirty-two
of his forty-six years and is now the
only full-time barber in Davidson—a
far cry from not so long ago when
twelve men cut hair in two shops on
Main Street.

Now there’s just one shop, painted
blue with the familiar candy-cane
sign outside and.a sign that says
“NORTON BARBERSHOP” in the
window. There’s a Davidson College
football schedule in the window, and
pictures of old Davidson teams hang
over the long mirror that runs down
one wall over the waiting chairs. The
other side.of the blue-walled shop is
taken up with barbering equipment.

Ken’s father-in-law, Walter John-
son, taught old Mr. Norton barbering.
Norton opened a shop at the southern
end of town. That was more than 50
years ago. Soon it moved to its present
location on Main Street, where it
remained.

Ken began cutting hair at fourteen,
entered barber school at fifteen, was a
full-fledged barber at sixteen, and

now owns the shop.
His cousin Ralph Johnson, who
began work some years before,

- operated another barbershop on the
corner of the same block facing the.

post office, between 1921 and 1971. He
retired at 63 and his ‘business went
with him. With long hair in style and
the days of ROTC haircuts over,
“business was getting kind of slow.”

Ralph Johnson’s barbershop was
the focus of a movement to integrate
the Davidson barbershops in 1965 and
1966. Tension amounted to a few
broken windows and was settled
quickly, resulting in one of the few
fully integrated haircut businesses in
this area.

The reason for this, Ken said, is par-
tly that cutting hair for different races
demands different techniques which
most people aren’t willing to learn.
Many barbers are old now, and “‘lear-
ning new ways can be hard.” Ken,
though, will cut for anyone and enjoys
it. :

But he will probably be the last Nor-
ton to barber in Davidson. We asked if
his son would go into business with
him. ‘‘Not at this point,’’ he answered.
“I’m not going to force him as long as
he finds something good to do.”” You
get the impression, though, that if his

_ fifteen-year-old doesn’t find his way

he will learn to cut.

Eventually Ken began talking about
Davidson and the college. He was
born here and, except for a two-year
stint as an M.P.at Fort Bragg during
the Korean War, has always worked
here.

Davidson, says Ken, has changed
since he began work. It grew as a
trade center for awhile, but now
‘people run into Charlotte for a spool
of thread.’ Industry has sprung up
here, mainly in the form of small
plants, but the stores which used-to do
go much business here are gone. They
went with a decline in business that
coincided with the growth of Char-
lotte. 3

The college, he went on, has a.dif-
ferent feel about it, too. The-dark
suits, ties and crewcuts aren’t the
only things that have disappeared.
Ken feels that despite an affected in-
formality students are more serious,
less apt to raise the roofs,

Then, too, he sees some school spirit
also going. A certain sense of

solidarity with and loyalty to the’

college is missing. ‘‘Take a football
game,” he said. ‘‘On a game weekend

everyone used to be at the stadium.
You wouldn’t see anyone walking
around like you see them now.”

“Yeah, I see a lot of students ...
going to the post office, the bank.’’ But
he feels the school’s relationship with
the community is a good one and does
see, every year, some students in-
volving themselves in Davidson life.

Talk turned to politics. Ken thinks
that the United States should quit
trying to export a democracy that no
one wants and try to consolidate itself
domestically. The exportation of
democracy isn’t worth the effort, he
told us, if it’s going to be corrupted
in the process.

Better, he suggests, to get moving
at home. Ken feels military service
should be compulsory, ‘‘no four-f’s
and no conscientious objectors,’’ and
that- along with higher education
should come a minimum of two years
of military training, after which
people would be free to choose their
careers. All this, he added, should be
paid for by the government.

“‘Tt’ll cost a lot,” he admitted, ‘‘but I
think it would pay off in the long run

with a whole lot more unity.”’ he |
doesn’t agree with President Ford’s
amnesty to draft evaders.

He doesn’t like disunity on racial
issues either: ‘‘Why do we have to
have black Americans and_ white
Americans and green and blue and
red Americans? Why can’t we all just
be Americans?” Splits along racial
lines aren’t good, he feels, even in
matters such as barbershops.

We left Ken as a customer came in-
a guy maybe eighteen with a mop of
brown hair. Ken smiled us out the
door and asked us to ‘‘send some of
our friends around.”’

Don’t say we didn’t tell you.
