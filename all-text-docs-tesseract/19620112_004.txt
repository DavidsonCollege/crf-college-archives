he regarded this as one of his
most valuable educational ex-
periences.

- “I have never had any respect
for the communists since then,”
said Dr. Goodykoontz. But he
went on to add that the same
“ruthlessness and power mad-
ness” which turned him against
the League had also turned him
against HUAC. In fact, he sum-
marized, “the witch and the
witch hunter are pretty much
alike.”

Citing the reasons for his ob-
jections to HUAC, Dr. Goody-
koontz first asked what consti-
tuted an “un-American activity.”
And he further asked whether
the handling of so touchy a mat-
ter, and such a dangerous one,
should not be carried out by ex-
perts, that is the Federal Bureau
of ‘Investigation, rather than by
a group of politicians who often
use the committee as a sounding
board for their own publicity.

But in action as well as in
theory, the remedy is almost as
bad as the disease, for Dr.
Goodykoontz pointed to the
ruthless treatment of individ-
vals by the committee. He cited
the case of 110 California school-
teachers who were subpoenaed
by the committee, complete
with publicity, and then never
given a hearing—to which the
California Attorney General re-
marked that there was no basis
for action under any of the
charges.

Further, HUAC is,
Goodykoontz’s analysis. both
judge and prosecutor in its
hearings. and it shares the Con-
gressional Committee privilege
of freedom from suit for dam-
ages. The individual before the
committee cannot defend him-
self and is like a boxer with
one hand tied. As our political
orthodoxy becomes narrower in
these times of crisis, patriotism
becomes identified with- such
things as fundamentalism, and
the activities of so-called pa-
triots take on all the aspects of
vigilante action.

With the great power that
has been given the cof mittee
we are justified in expecting it

to fill its function and to use
this vower with great care. Dr.
Goodykoontz feels that HUAC

in Dr.

Dr. George L. Abernethy, professor of philosophy at

Dr. Goodykoontz: ‘HUAC
Basically Un-American’

Last Monday night campus liberals felt that their cause was avenged. The oc-
‘casion: Dr. W. F. Goodykoontz reviews the news; the topic: the House Un-American

when he recalled an Air Force
manual which accused one-third
of the translators of the Revised
Standard Version of the Bible
of a questionable loyalty due to
their being “listed.”

“Forget the individuality of a
human being,” said Dr. Goody-
koontz, “and you get a good
communist or a good communist
hunter.” This was brought home
to him with the appearance of
Fulton Lewis and his “cold
mechanical efficiency.” And he
again stated that in fighting
communism we were getting too
much like communists.

Just as alarming as the help
lessness of the individual before
the committee is the helpless-
ness of the nation; we’ve got it
and it looks like we're stuck
with it. For Dr. Goodykoontz
asked how you were going to
find many people to oppose the
committee, thereby bringing
themselves under suspicion.

But if HUAC doesn’t do the
job, no matter how it does it,
who will? Dr. Goodykoontz stat-
ed again that a task so complex
and so delicate requires experts
who are primarily interested in
getting the job done without
ulterior motives, in short, the
FBI.

Until such time as we become
aware of the danger that is sup-
posed to protect. us from danger,
to the undermining of constitu-
‘tonal right, Dr. Goodykoontz
noted with more than a touch of
irony that he was looking for-
ward to the trend set by the

ties group with an “un-Mecklen-

Radio Club Finishes
High In Compstition

BY DAVE PUSEY
Davidsonian Feature Writer
The Radio Club brought another honor to the David-
son campus when it recently distinguished itself in a
state and nation-wide competition of amateur radio

operators.

The Radio Club had been dis-
banded for some time until it
was revived two years ago, with
the ROTC Department as its
guardian angel. ROTC furnishes
operating space for the club, as
well as some financial aid and
advisors; Captain. D. H. Threl-
keld now being most active with
the group. The Department also
put up the monster antennae
on the roof of Belk for the

‘Club’s use. These antennae can

be used for high-frequency
bands, permitting long-distance
operations.

Besides its meetings twice a
month, the Club sponsors other
activities and is open to all
students who demonstrate a ser-
ious interest in amateur radio.
If members don’t have and
would like to acquire an .ama-
teur license, the Club gives
special classes on code and oper-
ating practice and opmrating
theory to help them in their
FCC examination.

Club participated recently was

PIONEERING

Somewhere out there, beyond the realm of man’s present
understanding, lies an idea. A concept. A truth.

Gradually, as it comes under the concentration of .
disciplined minds, it will become clear, refined, mas-
tered, This is the lonely art of pioneering.

In the Bell System, pioneering often results in major
breakthroughs. Planning the use of satellites as vehicles
for world-wide communications is one. Another is the
Optical Gas Maser, an invention which may allow a
controlled beam of light to carry vast numbers of telephone
calls, TV shows, and data messages.

Breakthroughs like these

will one day bring exciting

new telephone and communications service to you. The
responsibility of providing these services will be in the
hands of the people who work for your local telephone
company. Among them are the engineering, administrative

The object of the contest was to
contact as many stations outside
of the U. S. as possible in a
specified two-day period. One
point was gained, for each dif-
ferent station contacted and one
point for each different coun-
try.

The points accumulated by
each contestant were fitted into
a formula which recognized the
difference in equipment, power,
etc. between the contcstants.
When the results were tabulat-
ed the Club was second in the
country on one of the amateur
bands with forty countries con-
tacted; it was second in the
state on a Morse Code band. and
first.'in the state on a voice
band, with a total of over seven-
ty thousand points in all the
various aspects of the contest.
The Club contacted ninety-nine
different countries during the
contest.
