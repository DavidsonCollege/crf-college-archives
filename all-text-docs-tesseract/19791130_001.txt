Reasons for refusal vary widely
Faculty rejects student evaluation form

By ELIZABETH KISS
Assistant News Editor

The faculty voted November
6 not to use the standardized
ICES forms for student evalua-
tion of professors. The forms,
developed by the University of
Illinois, had been selected for
college-wide use by the Profes-
sional Affairs Committee(PAC)
and Academic Vice President
Price Zimmermann.

PAC Chairman Anthony
Abbott said that the vote
reflected a wide variety of
objections to the forums. Some
professors disapproved of the
three ‘‘global’’ questions, which
ask students to rate the course
content, the instructor, and the
course in general, as too subjec-
tive and irrelevant. Others felt
that any standardized form is
inappropriate at Davidson.
There was also concern that a
mandatory evaluation system
would encoutage “conformity”
in teaching methods.

Religion professor Alexander
McKelway said a crucial issue
for the faculty was how the
forms would be handled. ‘‘We
need to know how the instructor
and the administration can best
interpret the evaluations,” he
said.

tion Procedures states that

College plans to adjust Commons dining hall design

By JOHN SINGLETON
Staff Correspondent

The Building Committee has
allocated $20,000 to redesign
the conveyor belt in the main
dining area of the proposed
Commons, in response to sever-
al complaints by faculty and
students.

Under the present plan, the
dining drea would be divided in
two by a conveyor belt carrying
trays back to the kitchen.

Union President Jim Robert-
son said he objected to the plan
because the permanent division
of the room would make it

unsuitable for large social func-
tions such as dances and ban-
quets.

Such large social activities
are one of the purposes of the
Commons dining area, which
was designed to be easily con-
vertible from a number of small
seating areas to one large room
by the removal of wooden
partitions.

The conveyor belt would also
be only 15 feet from the stairs
leading into the dining area.
This, according to Robertson,
would make it impossible to use
the room for a single purpose.

The belt would obstruct the
path of a person entering the
area. A stage or table set up in
front of the stairs would in-
crease the problem, blocking all
passage between the two sides
of the room.

College President Samuel
Spencer and Physical Plant
Director Grover Meetze met
with the architect to discuss
alternative designs for the con-
veyor belt. Meetze said that
they are “looking at a couple of
possibilities.”

The proposed revisions would

students must have a voice in
faculty evaluation. ‘‘The faculty
has committed itself to student
input into the evaluation pro-
cess,"’ Zimmermann said. Now,
they have turned down ‘‘the
best formal system” he and the
members of PAC could find.
According to Zimmermann,
the faculty still wants student
evaluation, but wishes to find a
better method. ‘‘I am waiting

for suggestions. Those who
were critical of ICES should feel
an obligation to come up with
an alternative,’’ he said.
Psychology Professor John
Kello said one possible solution
would be to appoint a subcom-
mittee of PAC which would
include faculty members who
objected to the ICES forms.
This committee would be re-

Retzer resigns as of January first;

New professor will continue classes

By KENT DYER
Staff Writer

Political Science Professor
Joseph Retzer is resigning from
teaching at Davidson, effective
January first.

Dennis (Jody) Encarnation, a
Phd candidate in Public Policy
at Duke, will assume Retzer’s
responsibilities for the .rest of
the school year, beginning the
fourth week of winter term.

Retzer plans to teach his
courses during the three weeks
before Christmas, but will leave
Davidson to start work at the
Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) in Washington,
D.C., soon after the holiday.

Retzer was denied tenure last
spring and was given the usual
one-year ‘grace period’”’ at Dav-
idson in which to seek another
job.

Political Science Department
Chairman Harris Proctor said
he began seriously considering
applicants for the job after
Retzer filed his resignation
early in November.

Retzer subsequently met with
Academic Vice President Price
Zimmermann and agreed to
teach winter term until a sui-
table replacement could be
found.

Encarnation, who is pres-
ently teaching Urban Politics at
UNC—Greensboro, was _ hired
after an interview with Zimmer-

A

mann and Proctor early last
week.

When asked about Zimmer-
mann’s decision to install En-
carnation in January, Proctor
said, *‘we were happy to help
him (Retzer) get settled into
EPA as soon after Christmas as
possible.”

Retzer did not feel that his
resignation in mid-term would
create a discontinuity in his
courses. Rather, he thought
that the addition of Encarna-
tion would add diversity. Retzer
said, “Mr. Encarnation’s spe-
cial knowledge in the area of
Public Policy will complement
by specialization in Political
Psychology. It will give stu-
dents a better overall exposure
to the subject than if I had
taught the course alone.’’

Proctor added that the trans-
ition to a new professor would
be easier to manage because of
the three week Christmas
break.

At EPA, Retzer will join
Philosophy: Professor John
young, who has been on Sab-
batical in Washington since
May, and will be involved in
long range policy analysis.

Encarnation will be under
contract to teach for winter and
spring terms, and may be
considered for a permanent
position in the Political Science
Department next fall,

National Review publishes Davidson student opinion; article’s author denounces own handiwork

By JOUN'SIMAN
Assistant News Editor

Fifty-two percent of Davidson students surveyed call
themselves conservative, according to'the November 23
National Revicw's cover story. Charles Kesler, the
story's author, said the methods used in the poll
‘*.,.would make a professional pollster grimace."'

The poll was conducted by Nutional Review, a
conservative, New York based magazine, in conjunc-
tion with Educational Reviewer, Inc., ‘Kesler said. It
was taken at twelve colleges and universities from
around the country.

Kesler described Davidson in the article as ‘‘a small,
private, Presbyterian men’s college in rural North
Carolina.” He attributed this error to poor information
supplied by Educational Reviewer.

Kesler emphasized that he was at the mercy of

was ‘“‘not very scientific’ and criticized many “of the
questions a “poorly worded.” ‘My. role actually was to
translate the figures into English,” Kesler said.

“I was working as a summer intern (with Valine
‘wtuu), Kesler, a graduate student at Harvard said.
As “low man on the totem pole,’’ he continued, ‘‘it was
my job to write it up.” Kesler added that he did so
unwillingly.

The poll measures student feelings on a variety of
political; social, and religious topics. In the article,
Kesler compared the poll's results to those of Vutionul
‘uwtuu student polls made in 1961-63 and 1969-70.

The poll was actually conducted in 1977; however,
the article's title is “‘The Movement of Student
opinion/ 1965, 1969, 1979." It was suggested to Kesler
that the conflict of dates is phen stciaed “Right,”’ Kesler

Pe tenen

Kesler did maintain, however, that 1977. data is

somewhat relevant when presented as 1979 Opinion.

‘Some of the students polled i in 1977 are bly still
at Davidson,” he said.

Davidson was the only one, of the twelve schools in

the survey that boasted a. majority of conservative
students. Davidson also polled the highest

percentage
of Republican students (forty-three percent). and the
lowest percentage of religiously non-affiliated students
{eight percent). * .

The other schools in the survey were South Carelina.
Williams, Yale, Marquette, Boston Indian-
a University, Howard, Reed, ‘Brandeis, and Stanford.

One of the National Re cn a8 editors’ felt v
