New York.— (ACP) —Five
hundred thousand college and
high-school students left their
class-rooms last Wednesday to
participate in the third annual
anti-war demonstration. The
demonstration was a “dress-
rehearsal?’ American Student
Union officials said, for the
course to be followed in the
event America declares an-
other war.

Although no accurate figures were
available, with the number demon-
strating estimated as high as 750,000
by some observers, attendance was

greatly in excess of the
350,000 predicted a few weeks ago
by Joseph Lash, national seeretary

of the Student’ Union. The first
strike, in 1934, brought out only
25,000 students. Last year it jump-
ed to 175,000.

onstrations were orderly, with-little
