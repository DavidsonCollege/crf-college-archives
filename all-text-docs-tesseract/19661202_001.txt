Ford’s ‘Tough’ Date
Gets Most From Life

Junior Clay Ford, as a result of his win-
ning a contest sponsored by Dare magazine.
will board an. airplane today to begin an ex-
pense-free weekend excursion with a beau-
tiful girl from Ohio Wesleyan College.

To enter the contest Ford had to write a
letter to the girl telling her ‘how to get the
most out of life." The girl, Susan Myers,
judged the letters and chose the winner.

Ford said that he and some of his frater-
nity brothers happened to be reading the
advertisement and someone suggested that
one of them should enter. Ford decided that
if he -had the time he would write the girl.

Then he became sick, and wrote the prize-
winning letter while in the infirmary. Ford
said that he wrote it in a ‘‘half-serious, half-

joking’ manner.

Ford said that his letter speculated that
the entries would fall naturally into several
divisions that would. hold moderate interest
for Miss Myers.

“But one letter will have someth‘ng extra.

an ‘x-plus’ letter.

‘To Blue Sky

By ROBERT PYEATT
Staff Writer

Bobby Lane and Doug: Woodworth have been selected
to serve as non-voting student representatives on the Fac-
ulty’s “Blue Sky” Committee.

Lane and Woodworth were chosen from a list of
nominees presented by the Student Curriculum Revision
Committee which included seniors Bill Norman, George
Nzongola and Woodworth, and juniors Sumner Bullard,
Ross Cornwell and Lane.

The faculty committee voted three weeks ago to ac-
cept non-voting student repre-
sentation on the Blue Sky Com-
mittee following a proposal by
the Student Curriculum Revision
Committee and lengthy discus-
sion.

“I hope we will have some
new ideas and be able to rep-
resent effectively the student
body,”’ Woodworth, a senior
from Staunton, Va., commented.
“I think we will have to dig into
some of our resources, particu-
larly recent. graduates who are
in grad school to get different
perspectives on curriculum re.
form. We will work with the
Student Curriculum Revision
Commiltee and find out what
changes are being proposed.”

The College Union is taking
steps to rectify and to prevent
the recurrence of a reported
magazine swindle, according to
College Unicon Director C. Shaw
Smith.

Seventeen students have re
ported being approached. by un.
authorized magazine salesmen
who were on campus before the
holidays. Smith continued.

The Union has issued a ques
tioraaire inquiring into the cir-
cumstances of the sales and dis-
cussed the problem with the
Better Business Bureau in Char-
lotte and the president of the
circulation company for whom

“This is a tremendous oppor-
tunity and a tremendous respon-
sibility." Lane. a junior from
New Orleans, remarked, ‘since
there will only be two of us rep-
resenting the student body. We
have the responsibility of mak.
ing a significant contribution.”

The student committee divid-

ed its choices among juniors and |’

seniors in order to gain a meas-
ure of continuity, while taking
advantage of the number of ia-
terested seniors.

service.

Mooty emphasized that  stu-
dents ‘‘shouldn’t shy away be-
cause they feel it will be a
h'gh-planed intellectual exer-
cise. The primary goal is to
provide a relaxed atmosphere
where students and professors
can get together and discuss
their problems.’"* He added that
there would be plenty of time
for recreation.

Union Acts To Rectify
Magazine Sale Losses

the salesmen were supposedly
working. ;

Many of the students overpaid
for subscriptions, which were
purchased during door to door
soliciting in the dormitories.

The president of the company
has told Smith that “I will do
all I can to make up for the
losses."

The problem has been report-
ed to the Better Business Bureau
in Charlotte, which is working
with the circulation company
to track down the salesmen.

The. salesmen typically said
that they were working their
way through college and that

is to insure mutual justice. Since
racial segregation is unjust, the
citizens can be forced to ob-
serve justice. Because a “nature
of government is regulatica,”’
Johnson claimed that property,
choice . . . can be regulated just
as murder and robbery can. The
“government does not have any-
thing to regulate but morality."
The state ‘‘must make racial in-
justice illegal.”

Harry Hamil said that it was
“not a question of personal vs.
property rights, but of person-
al vs. personal and property
rights.’ Therefore the justifica-
tion of civil rights legislation
“‘must be a value judgment,

; either moral or pragmatic.”

Charles Vick first admitted
that he really didn’t know any-
thing about the problem, but he
thought that legislation usually
follows practice."’ He said the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to
plug loopholes in present laws
and to prevent some counties
from getting around previous

, voting laws.

As to motels, they are ‘‘pub-
lic places’, and the ‘‘Negro is
part of the ‘public.”’ He told of a
Negro who had to sleep in his
Cadillac because he couldn't
find a ‘Negro motel’.

Tom Rhodes asked, “how can

you decide what is public, what
is private property?” What if
the owner of the Cadillac, men-
tioned by Vick, ‘‘couldn’t choose
who could sleep in his car?”

Rhodes went on to say that
races have inherited differences
and ‘‘any civil rights movement
which makes supposition to the
contrary is ignorant.’’ Accord-
ing to Rhodes, equality means
‘equality under the law, not en-
forced mixing.”

Vick then brought up the prob-
lem of the organizations which
have grown up out of the civil
rights movement bringing civil
unrest.

Finally, a member of the audi-
ence stated that if freedom was
the question, neither forced seg-
regaticn nor forced integration
was right, but that freedom of
choice and association must pre
vail.

This was countered with the
paradox that only force will pre-
serve freedom. Another member
of the audience, Leslie Brown,
stated that this was typical of
white sitting-down discussion of
the “black problem.’’ For, he
went on to say, this is a “white
man’s problem not a black prob-
lem” as it was called by the
whites.

\Faculty
‘Overrules
‘Dismissal

The faculty. voted Monday at a
special called meeting to lessen
to campusing until spring holi-
days the penalty of a freshman
convicted earlier by the Execu-
tive Committee for being under
the influence of alcohol on cam-
pus.

The violation of the faculty's
rule listed in the Wildcat Hand-
book under “Student Conduct,”
Section 5a, occurred Nov. 19 at
the concert by the Four Sea-
sons.

The Executive Committee
heard testimony on the case on
Nov. 22 and sentenced the -stu-
dent to a semester's suspension
from the college.

Subsequently, the student ap-
pealed his sentence to the fac-
ulty, claiming it was excessive,
though no denial of guilt was
made.

they had no living parents. Smith
said that last year magazine
salesmen came around claiming
to be selling for Boys’ Town.

By publicizing the college reg
ulations concerning unauthoriz-
ed dormitory soliciting, Smith
hopes to prevent the recurrence
of more incidents.

Smith emphasized that solicit-
ing of any kind is prohibited in
all dormitories, and that per-
mission has never been granted
for door-to door selling.

Salesmen on, campus, if they
are authorized, will be announc-
ed by the Unicn before they ar.
rive, according to Smith.

NO HOSTILITY

A college security officer re-
Ported the violation to the Of-
fice of the Dean of Students after
Seeing the student fall in the
lobby of Chambers. The secur-
ity officer asked the student if
he was under the ‘afluence of
alcohol.

The student was cooperative
with the security officer and
showed no hostility, according
to the report to the Dean of Stu-
dents. The officer did not testi-

to take a job as athletic director
at the University of Connecticut.

Hickey resigned last weekend
after Carolina's final game of
the season with Virginia. In Sun-
day's edition of daily newspapers
ia Greensboro and Durham,
columnists mentioned Smith as
a possible replacement for Hic-

key.

Smith attended the game in
Chapel Hill. but told THE DA-
VIDSONIAN that ‘I only went
because I wanted to see a col-
lege football game. and this was
the closest one."

A committee has been named
at Chapel Hill to choose Hickey's
successor, but it has made no
announcement of what figures
are being considered. Nor has
it announced what coaches have
expressed interest in the job.

Smith, who played fullback
for Princeton, came to David-
son as head coach in 1965 from
the Air Force Academy, where
he was backfield coach. During
Smith's first year, Davidson reg-
istered its wirst winning season

sons. This year Davidson fin-

mittee or the faculty.

Student Body President Chuck
Matthews and Student Body Sec-
ond Vice-President Tom Earm-
hardt represented the student at
the faculty meeting Monday.

UNUSUAL SEVERITY

In their defense, they pointed
to the unusual severity of the
Executive Committee's punish-
ment under the circumstances
of the case, including his co-
operation, and his liability to the
draft. should he be suspended.

In addition, they called atten-
tion to the lack of consistency
in enforcing the faculty’s’ ban
on dr:aking and being under the
influence.

“The committee went by the
rule book.” Dean of Students
Richard C. Burts Jr. said later.
“It’s too soon to. say whether the
faculty’s action can be inter-
preted as a precedent."

The dean ventured an op:nion
that a similar case would be de.
cided with a like punishment by
the Executive Committee as the

‘first decision.

SOME DOUBT

But the incident introduces an
element of doubt, he said, in fu-
ture decisions by the commit-
tee. ‘‘The faculty has generally
overruled the Executive Com.
mittee about cnce every 10
years,’ he explained, but went
on to point out that the last
time this occurred was some-
thing over four years ago.

“OF course, the faculty didn’t
overrule the committee."’ Burts
explained, “it merely changed
the punishment. There was nev-

er any discussion about the stu-
dent's guilt."

Mooty Elected To Edit
’"67 Wildcat Handbook

Junior Mike Mooty was elected
editor .of the Wildcat Handbook
on Nov. 22. Mooty received 162
votes to Bruce Weihe's 102 votes.

Mooty said, ‘‘We want to find
out from the freshmen what was
helpful to them and what was
not needed.”

In his platform Mooty suggest-
ed that the handbook include
‘the Honor Court's pamphlet on
the Honor System, a revised
social life section with a descrip-

tion of places to go and things
to do in Charlotte, and a descrip-
tion of course options open to
freshmen.”

After picking his staff, Mooty
wants “to decide on the format
of the Handbook.” With approxi-
mately $600 remaining from the
66 Handbook budget, “‘it is safe
to assume that the '67 Handbook
could be greatly enlarged in
scope with regard to size and
content, number of pictures and
cover printing."
