THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 5, 1925

Freshman Team to Play
- Furman Yearlings Next

Furman Rats Said to Have Strong
Aggregation This Season

On Thursday afternoon the Freshman
football team, accompanied by Coach Matox
and Manager Carroll, will journey to Green-
ville to encounter the strong Furman aggre
gation. The game was first scheduled to be
played on October 23, but was lated moved
back to Friday, November 6.

It, is reported that Furman, as usual, has
an exceptionally strong team. Just how
Captain Black and his cohorts will emerge
from the game can not be predicted, as com-
parative scores are not available. Moreover,
figures tell little of the teams’ comparative
strength. Last year the team came out with
the short end of a 26-0 score. We can at
least hope for an improvement over this. A
victory would be sweet revenge in the face
of the Varsity’s 6-0 defeat at the hands of
the Hurricane. a

One Furman back seems to be outstanding.

Reports announce him as the wonder of the
South, His punting is said to average 70
yards consistently. ‘

The Davidson outfit is still weakened by
the absence of several men who are disabled
by injuries or disqualified on account of
scholastic deficiency. Coach Matox states
that the same men will start who faced Duke
last Friday.

Dr. and Mrs. Arbuckle with their son
Howard and daughter Adele, recently
paid a visit to Decatur, Ga., for the cen-
tennial of the Presbyterian Church in
that city. Dr. Arbuckle was formerly
professor of chemistry at Agnes Scott
College which is located there. He and
his family resided there for fifteen years
and were greatly loved by the entire
community.

The trip was made through the coun-
try and they were entertained on the
Agnes Scott campus upon their arrival.
During their short stay they were the
recipients of numerous invitations from
old time friends. Dr. Arbuckle was grad-
uated from Hampden-Sidney College and
later received his Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins.
He immediately went to Agnes Scott as
profassor of chemistry and remafned
there until he resigned in 1913 to accept
a similar position at Davidson.

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

Well, another stumbling block is out of
the way, and now remains the greatest
game of the year—that with Carolina.
Davidson always fights Carolina particu-
larly hard, and this year, the eleven men
who take the field at Chape! Hill will
have more than the ordinary honor to
fight for. '

It seemed that sports writers over the |
state took it as a matter of fact that Da- |
vidson defeated State this past Saturday. |
That might be true, but we don’t like to
take any game as a matter of fact thing.

Just at present we are thinking about
the game with Hampden-Sidney next
Saturday in Charlotte. Some of the fel-
lows seem to think that this is going to
be as casy game, and that the players
will not need their support that after-
noon.

Such an idea is erroneous. Hampden-
Sidney has a good team, and that is not
mere “bull” either; That dope comes
from those who have seen this scrapping
team play.

Remember, they are Presbyterians, too,
and that ought to be a mouth-full. They
had rather beat Davidson than win from
a number of other teams. Just now they
want to beat Davidson like we want to
to beat Carolina,

They've got a big bunch of boys, which,

| however, is nothing new when it comes

to the games the Wildcats play. In that
respect they will have a big edge over us.

If you don’t think they are good, lis-
ten to this: Florida defeated Hampden-
Sidney 21 to6; Florida beat Wake For-
est 24 to 3; Wake Forest and Davidson
tied. Isn’t that a fair comparison, Fur-
ther, Hampden-Sidney beat Elon 31 to 0;
Davidson defeated Elon 34 too. Another
Furthermore,
V. P. I. only nosed out Hampden-Sid-
ney six points,

All of which makes us want to see the
game Saturday. It would be a shame to
have but a more handful of students at
Charlotte for the game. Be there and
urge the Wildcats forward to make this
another win.

The Wildkittens seem to do better
without several of their regular men than
with them. They showed new life—
something akin to the true Wildcat spirit
—when they defeated the far heavier
Duke freshman team.

Kell and Leftwich were the stars, of
the backfield and line respectively, and
were ably supported by Black in the
backfield on defense and Smith and Le-
Fevre in the line. The whole team was
in fighting trim that day, for that mat-
ter. They are going to be given a chance
this season to show their fight some
more.

Play golf, boys, play: golf! ‘The holes
are in good shape now, and somebody is
going to make a few trips with the golf
team this season. Freshmen are eligible
for this team, and a number of them may
be needed.

The new athletic equinment that has
been placed on the campus is being used
now, and according to those in charge a
systematized form of athletic contests are
to be put in on a small scale.

It won’t be long now before football
season is over. Then will come basket-
ball. The class games now fluctuate be-
tween interesting games and otherwise.
The freshmen team is woefully lacking
in material, and any game with them
does not hold much interest. Our idea at
first was that the Seniors would win the
class championship. The Sophs are
showing an offense that is sweeping ev-

erything before it so far.

Sophs Win From Juniors
“in Exciting Class Game

Juniors Later Win From Freshmen
Cage T: oun Stars

The second week of cage battles brought
victory to the Junior and Sophomore teams,
the Sophomores defeating the Juniors 20 to
16, and the Juniors defeating the Freshmen
27 to 13. The Junior-Soph games was play-
ed on Tuesday night and the Junior-Fresh-
man game on the following Thursday even-
ing.

The Junior-Soph battle was a grand rush
from the opening of the game until the clos-
ing whistle, and the speed of the players, on
both sides, made this battle intensely inter-
esting. Wilson and Weld played particularly
good ball for the Sophs, each putting the
leather sphere through the rim three times.
For the Juniors, Simpson and Calhoun were
the outstanding players.

In the. Junior-Fresh battle the Juniors
used their second team for the entire last
half. Calhoun again starred, but this time he
gained his support from Keerans. Hunt and
Guilmour took the honors for the Freshmen,
making 10 of the 13 points, :
