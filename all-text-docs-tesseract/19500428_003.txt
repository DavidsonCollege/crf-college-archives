About this time last
year Jack Hazard came
bouncing into my room,
slapped me on the back
and said, ‘‘Congratula-
, tions Scotty — you've
been appointed Sports’
& Editor of the Davidson-
, jan.’ Almost imme-
' diately, we sensed the

work and time that the
job would entail, but it
was later, perhaps last
fall, when we really be-
gan to realize that the
labor side of the job
was insignificant as
compared to the pleas-
ure received out of it. And it has been a pleasure and privilege to
report on the sports’ situation on this oak-covered campus dur-
ing the past year. .

In looking back over the sporting events of the year, there
are several things that stand out in our mind ... the dogged fight
by Charley Jamerson’s gridders against all- -conynering Army,
and the subsequent failure of the team to produce in other
games ... the dedication of Johnston Gymnasium and the event
of a well-rounded physical education program, to say nothing
of having an adequate arena in which to play home basketball
games... the suecess which Boydson Baird enjoyed in his first
fling at coaching varsity basketball .. . the near-faultless per-
formances on the hardwood of truly ‘‘one of the greatest of them
all,’ Captain Whit Cobb ... the spirit and keen competition
among the fraternities in the basketball rounds . . . the good
showing made by Dick Reddings swimming team, the first in
the history of this institution ... the record posted thus far by
the un-tutored golf team... the track team which has effort-
lessly run past all its opponents except S. C.... the arrival of
Paul Scott on the campus to assume his duties as Athletie Direc-
tor... and finally the stirring win by Sir Derrick’s crew over
North Carolina’s netmen,

Reporting all of these, and other events, has required a great
deal of work and inconvenience to a number of persons, and we
would like to extend our sincere thanks to them for a job well-
done. Amonig those who are due a bouquet are Bob Johnson and
John Talbert, the college photographers, who were always john-
ny-on-the-spot when there was a need for pictures .. Joe Thigpen,
who rendered valuable aid when pictures or information were
needed ... the athletic staff which cooperated graciously when
they were approached for facts and figures ... Dan McKeithen,
our right hand man, who did a lion’s share of the work that
went into putting out the sports’ pages . .. Cherry Stribling who
did a commendable job in writing up the Wildeat of the Week
each edition . . . Bill White and Bill Adams whose first-rate
articles have appeared in practically every issue of the paper all
year long ... and Charlie Hawkins, Jim Farrar, Mac Richards,
Bill Bradford, Dick Liles, Woody McKay, Jim Smith, Bill
Farrior, J. V. Howell, Al Cook, and Bill Brooks, whose writings
have been the backbone of the paper. All of these men composed
a sports’ staff which any college paper would be proud to have.
They have all worked hard and deserve commendation for their
efforts.

All of the suggestions and criticisms which have come
from the student body at large have been appreciated, because
they have helped correct some of the weaknesses in the paper.
There were, and still are, however, many improvements that can
be made on the Wildcat Sports page next year.

To our successor, who is yet to be named, we wish the best of.
luck in his efforts and to you readers who have bothered with
wading throught Cat Tails this year, we say thanks a million.

GORDON SCOTT

By BILL

Davidson’s netters clawed out
a 5-4 victory Saturday afternoon
over the vaunted V-shirts of Caro-
lina and thus scored a triple win.
First of all, it meant the State
Championship for Davidson, sec-
ondly, the victory broke a 15 meet
wining streak for UNC, and ‘third-
ly, it was a special gift to Coach
Derrick Barton, who would rather
beat Carolina than retura to bonny
Britain.

It was nip and tuck every step
of the way, with both tea.ns look-
ing like the winner and then like
the loser. With the matches tied
at 4-4, all eyes turned to sopho-
mores Allan Strand and Dewey
Keesler. The final and deciding
match was won by ‘this pair over
Jim Hammerstein and Hugh Beam
of Carolina in straight sets, 6-4,
6-3.

In other matches, Clark Taylor,

the day. Both boys played tnagnifi-

have been no disgrace.

Whit Cobb trinumed Heath Alex-
ander of Carolina 7-5, 6-4, in a very
good match.

Fanjoy outlasted Dasmeron 7-9,

A very nice job, Cats, and or-

‘its spotlight on Allan Fanjoy as the

ALLAN FANJOY

Wildcat of the Week for his su-| for the Wildcat tennis team against
perb performance against Lesley | Carolina Saturday. .
Dameron in the No. 5 singles spot} The defeat of Dameron seemed
to be the turning point in the match
as Derrick Barton's Cats went on
to take 2 out of 3 doubles matches
and hand the Carolina netters their
first defeat of the year. Wildcat
Spirits were at a low level after
he defeats of Bo Roddey and Ted-
dy Keesler as they looked at the
scoreboard and saw that Fanjoy
was already a set behind in the on-
ly singles match still going. But as
his match with Dameron lingered
on and on, it became apparent that
Fanjoy was not to be denied. Over-
coming his early disadvantage, he
put on probably his best perform-
ance of the year as he rallied time
and again to outlast Dameron and
register a 7-9, 6-2, 10-8 victory
which evened the singles matches
at 3 all, and also seemed to give the
Cats, a needed wp-lift for the dou-
ble yet tso come. ,
Then Fanjoy teamed with Ted-
dy Keesler to beat Heath Alexan-
der and Winstead in the No. 2 dou-
- bles match to further aid the Wild-
cat cause.

Allan Fanjoy is a senior from

year of varsity competition. Victor-
ies such as the one Saturday when
he has come through under pres-
sure have greatly aided the Wild-
cats in comprising their remark-
able record this year aml have made
him a much respected member of
the Davidson tennis class.

Tennis Team Continues Victorious;
Duke Dumps Dicmondmen, 16-5

By WOODY McKAY

N. C, State’s netters were trounc- ,
ed by Davidson’s racqueteers 9-0,'

in the Wildcats last match before
leaving for their northern trip.

After taking the singles without
losing a set, the Wildcats continued
their shutout by taking all three
doubles without losing more than
three games in any onc of these last
sets.

Coach Barton dipped into his re-
serves in the singles and placed
Peyre Kennedy and Bilt Childs ir
the No. 5 and No. 6 slots respective-
ly. Both came through with wins as
did the regular top four. Bo Rod-
dey, playing his usual consistant
game blanked Caldwell Ragay 6-0,

6-0, to take the No. I spot. Teddy

Keesler, Whit Cobb, Allan Strand,
and Peyre Kennedy had little trou-
ble in securing victories over their
opponents. Bill Childs was pushed
during his first set before winning
7-5, but settled down in the second
set to take it 6-1.

Davidson's netters embark this
week end on their northern tour
where they will run up against such
teams as William and. Mary and
Yale, and they're also going to have
good competition from their other
opponents. William and = Mary,
whose long winning streak was
broken last Wednesday by the Uni-
versity of Miami, has a strong team

again tied the linksters from David-
son, this time 15-15, Earlier this
season the two teams played to a
13%4-1314, deadlock in Charlotte.

Medalist of the match was Da-
vidson's ‘nusnber one man, Monty
Hill, who fired a sparkling three. \
under-par 69. His opponent, Hunt-
ley Spencer, was only one stroke
behind with a 70. None of the Wild-
cats were up in the eighties. The
course was in good shape, the hard
fairways and soft greens aiding in
keeping scores. low.

Each team played with seven
men and it’s well for the locals that
they did. State was leading by a
15-12 score when the cards of the
first three foursomes had been !
totaled. The outcome was left in
the hand's, of the final two-some.
Bob -Bumbarger rose "to the occa-
sion by defeating his man, 3-0, thus
giving Davidson the points needed
