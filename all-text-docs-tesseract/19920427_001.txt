presented to the Trustees. They

other campus organizations such

New Ethnic
Studies Program
Awaits Its Leader

By Chris Wells
Two weeks ago, Davidson
interviewed two candidates, Ear-
nest Brown and Nancy Fairly, for
the position of Coordinator of a

new. Ethnic-Studies-program. > -:

The ‘program, according’ to
Dean of Faculty, Robert Williams,
isto be designed to “look at ethnic-
ity broadly, as an American and
even as a global phenomenon.”

A proposed concentration
within the program is intended first
to examine the African-American
culture, and then later expand to
cover both Hispanic and Native
American cultures as well.

The Educational Policy Com-
mittee has delayed the formatior:
of the concentration, waiting for,
as Williams said, “a critical mass
of faculty who could teach courses
in ethnic studies.” But with the
addition of Dr. Janet Shannon, Dr.
Wanda Webb, Dr. Barbara Ballard
and others, the committee feels
- that Davidson is now prepared to
start up the program.

In order to receive a concen-
tration in Ethnic Studies, it is pro-
jected that students will have to
take arange of courses from differ-
entdepartments. Itis also possible
that a capstone course may be cre-
ated, requiring students to com-
plete the course in order to obtain
~ the concentration.

Dean's Office Disciplines Fraternity

' By Tom Price |

Dean of Students Will Terry
has devised a thirteen-item list of
directives which the SAE frater-
nity must meet in order to remain
on campus. SAE has been under
investigation because of several
charges of impropriety over the
course of this past year. The Select
Committee on “Rebuilding Com-

munity” specifically dealt with the _

SAE house inits reportandrecom-

, Although the concentration
may not be approved by the fac-
ulty for another year or two, it is
probable that students will be able

‘to count courses taken before the

concentration isin place.

The new coordinator, who will
be given a tenured appointment in
a department, will have three re-
sponsibilities: to coordinate the
Ethnic Studies Program, to teacha
reduced course load at Davidson
and to teach one course at Johnson
C. Smith University, a historically
African-American college. Wil-
liams said that “the chance to teach
at both a historically-black institu-
tion as well as a historically white
institution” was “particularly at-
tractive” to applicants for the posi-
tion. Seas east

Davidson hopes that the new
coordinator will also be able to
raise funds, for. the program in
addition to fulfilling their stated
responsibilities. As the program
will be given the budget ofa small:
department, the director, like the
directors of the Dean Rusk and the
Medical Humanities programs,
should be able to write grant pro-
posals and raise money for the
program.

Williams, assessing the ap-
pointment, said, “I think we will

Terry explained that he felt the
Committee’s recommendation of
prohibiting rushing and pledging
activities for two years “would kill
the fraternity slowly” and that if
these sanetions were imposed that

These monitors-will enforce the
new regulations on Patterson Court
and will report.all violations to the
Alcohol Enforcement Committee
and the Dean of Students Office.
They will therefore play a large
role in determining whether or not
thisnew policy succeeds in achiev-
ing the objectives of the admini-
stration and Trustees.

The college has also created a
new administration position to
work with the Dean of Students
Office in the supervision and guid-
ance of Patterson Court. This

person will live in the old PAX
house and will be employed as the

Assistant to the Dean for Patterson

Court. The Dean’s Office is cur-
rently receiving applications for

this job.

Deans and Student Leaders
Address Criticism and Problems

By Will Boye
__ Last Wednesday in Love audi-
torium, Davidson students were
given an opportunity to attend a
forum that addressed the college’s
recently altered alcohol policy as
well as the findings and sugges-
tions of the Select Committee on
“Rebuilding Community”. The
forum was composed of speeches
given by Dean of Faculty Robert

Williams, John Patton - a student
member of the Select Committee,
Dean of Students Will Terry, and
David Wright - Chairman of the
Patterson Court Council. The fo-
rum was designed to respond to
those questions that have been most

frequently asked by students about

both the Select Committee and the
Alcohol Policy, allowing the com-
munity a candid environment in
which their concerns might be dis-

cussed.

The first speaker of the eve-
ning was Dean of Faculty Robert
Williams, who. specifically ad-

‘dressed the nature of the Select

Committee, the process undertaken
by the Committee, and potential
methods of coping with campus
intolerance. Williams began his
speech by pointing out the neces-

option of dissolving the house or
attempting to rebuild it, Terry said|
he opted for “the path of rehabilita-
tion.” Terry emphasized the im-
portance of SAE meeting these
directives. “If they do not,” -he
said, “they will be asked to leave.”
