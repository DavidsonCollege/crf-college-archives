cott To Trim 1972-73 Athletic Budget

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor
The athletic budget for next

vear is presently being worked

out, and will differ’ only slightly

from this year’s budget.
Director of Athletics ‘Tom

| preliminary budget, reportedly
| requesting about $370,000 total,
and that budget has been re

Vbev told tne Athletic Qermert
ment that the minor sport bua-
gets cannot be cut.

“We felt that the minor sports
should be left) alone,” Svencer
stated. ‘They operate on a bare
minimum now.”

seott said the raise in bud
get had been requested to ac-
count for inflation next year.

“We have been informed by
the food services that the costs
of meals will go up next year,
and the cost of the laundry is
going, up. also, he said.

“This means that the costs
necessary to run a training ta
ble and provide for visiting
teams will go up.” he added.

These rising. costs will hurt
the minor sports much = more

than either football or pasket
ball. Minor sport budgets are
almost entirely concerned with
travel and the costs of hosting
other teams.

The agreement worked out
with Terry Holland, baskethall
coach for the Wildcats, will
also limit the amount of cutting
Scott can do in the budzet.

The terms of Holland's new
agreement with the collese com-
mit Davidson to a ‘‘top twenty”’
basketball program, acording to
Spencer, and limit the amount
of cutting that can be done on
the basketball budget.

“We have agreed with Coach
Helland that the program should
be a strong one, and we decided
to raise his recruiting :nd_ pro-
motion budgets.”

The budget is presently await-
ing revision by the Athletic De
partment.

“We have recommended an
across the board cut,"’ Spencer
said, ‘‘and we leave it u» to
the Department to decide whcre
the cuts will come.”

Holland To Remain
As Cat Cage Coach

Davidson will be without the
services of two present coaches
next year, but Terry Holland,
coach of the Davidson basket-
ball team, will remain.

Holland negotiated a new
“agreement” with the college
this week.

Late last week, Holland re-
ceived an offer for the head
coaching position for the Wake
Forest cagers. He was chosen as
one of the three final candi-
dates for the job vacated by
Jack McCloskey last month.

Holland turned down the posi-
lion at. Wake Forest Wednesday
night.

Part of the new agreement
with the college is what Presi-
dent Samuel R. Spencer Jr. call-
ed a “commitment to a_ top-
twenty team”.

Spencer said that the basket-
ball program will receive a
raise in both recruiting and pro-
motional budgets starting next
year.

“We feel that the program has

not been promoted as well as it
should be,” Spencer said, ‘‘and
attendance figures at the Coli-
seum poimt this out.”

Spencer said that the new pro-
motional money would be “‘mon-
ey sent after money” and repay
the college in game receipts.

One facet of the promotion
would be through a new tele.
vision program for Holland on
local stations, according to Spen-
cer.

Spencer said that the basket-
ball recruiting budget would al-
so be beefed up in an effort to
continue to draw top players to
Davidson.

Two other coaches will not be
at Davidson next year, however,
and as yet no replacements have
been found for either track
coach Heath Whittle or baseball
coach Tom Stevens.

Whittle is retiring at the end
of this season.

‘‘We have two alternatives in
replacing Coach Whittle,” Di-
rector of Athletics Tom Scott
stated. ‘“‘We can either move
Sterling Martin into physical ed-
ucation fulltime and hire a
track coach, or make Martin
track coach and hire someone
to fill in P.E.” ;

Scott said no decision has
been made.

Tom Stevens, baseball, fresh-
man football; and swimming
coach, will take a year’s leave
of absence to get his doctorate
next year.

Scott said that no new coach
would be brought in to fill his
positions, but that they would
be covered by the present staff.

Spencer said that this ap-
proach is used in every depart-
ment but that the Athletic De-
partment has a unique position
because ‘‘they have such a lar-

ge budget with so many line

items.”’

“IT imagine that they can
make a good number of cuts in
operating expeses,” he added,

“but we leave all the cutting
in the budget to Dr. Scott."’

The budget should be finaiized
“during the next few weeks”
according to Scott.

Thinclads Favored In Relays

Whittle lists his own squad
among the favorites in the
event.

“This should be a really in-
teresting meet, and I would
rank us as one of the favorites
along with West Georgia, Cum-
berland, High Point and Berry,”
Whittle observed.

Other schools participating
are Carson-Newman, Guilford,
Catawba, Appalachian, Emory,
Milligan, Gardner-Webb and
University of the South.

The meet will crown a new
champion, as last year’s win-
ner Pembroke was not imvited
to return because of their heavy
subsidization.

“We designed the meet pri-
marily for _ mon - subsidized
schools, and we try to keep the
field evenly balanced. This year
there is no clear-cut favorite,”
explained Whittle.

The Wildcats have taken the
title six times, the last time in
1968.

As usual, Whittle looks for
versatile Ray Swetenburg to be
one of the top individual stars.

“Ray definitely can win the
120-yd. high hurdles, which is a
new event, and possibly the
triple jump,” commented Whit-
tle.

Swetenburg captured second
place in the triple jump last
year, and holds the meet rec-
ord of 47-8 which he achieved
in 1970.

Another new event is the 100-
yd. dash, and Whittle predicted
that Wildcat sprinter Tom
Richardson would face’ very
stiff competition.

Whittle anticipates a good
showing by the Cat relay teams,
noting that “‘they all have a
chance to place.”

These participants include
Swetenburg, Mark _ Connors,
Dave Peaco and Richardson in
the 440-yard relay; Connors,
Rick Bell, Richardson and Rich-
ard Fort in the mile relay;
Richardson, Swetenburg, Fort
and Bell in the sprint medley;
Richardson, Swetenburg, Peaco

and Steve Still in the 880-yard
relay, and Connors, George Ed-
wards, Bob Lautensack and Bell
in the 2-mile relay.

Other thinclads counted on for
points by Whittle are Woody
Van Meter in the pole vault,
Steve Shankweiler in the shot
put and Dave Crumpler in the
discus.

Crumpler gamered a fourth-
place finish in last year’s com-
petition.

The tracksters enter the Re-
lays following a disappointing
81-64 loss to Berry College last
Saturday.

Whittle described that con-
test as one which could have
gone either way, noting that
‘‘we did well in many events,
but in others we weren't up to
par.”

The defeat marked the first
time that Swetenburg had been
beaten in the triple jump in a
dual competition, according to
Whittle.

Also hurting the thinclads’
performance was the absence
of Glenn Mee, who could have

placed in the shot put and the
javelin.

Mee arrived at the meet late,
‘and his presence was sorely
missed, stated Whittle.

Whittle pointed to Ted Ellett
as a thinclad who showed pro-
mise in the meet. ‘‘He did very
well by winning the 440-yd. in-
termediate hurdles,” noted Whit-
tle.

In last year’s Relays the Cats
failed to score in the running
events, and Whittle expects
much improvement tomorrow.

The_ strongest opposition
should be provided by High
Point, Berry and Cumberland
in the distance events, and West
Georgia, Berry and Cumber-
land in the sprints.

The scoring will operate on a
10-8-6-4-2 point scale for the re-
lays, and a 6-4-3-2-1 scale in the
field events and open running
events.

The Relays will get under way
at noon with the 6-mile run,
another mew event, and will
conclude with the 2-mile relay,
scheduled for 5 p.m.
