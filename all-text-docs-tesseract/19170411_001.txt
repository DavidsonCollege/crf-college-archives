three runs. Another was added in the

In a ragged game of baseball last
Saturday. afiernoon in Charlotte, — the
Red and Black went down to deteat be
fore the Charlotte Leaguers by the over
whelming score of 1 to 3. Not only
did the Hornets slam the offerings ‘of
the Davidson twirlers to all corners of
the lot, but nine errors also aided them
materially in running up the score. ‘The
Red and Black were uvabie te hit the
Charlotte ovitchers with imuch success.
anly. getting six hits in coniparison tk
fifteen gieaned by their opponents.

Although the day was perfect for
baseball, the game was carly vurned inte
a regular joketeast, and outside of a
ash of pood fielding now and then,
largely ou Charlottes part, it] was a
poor eshibitiun ot ashe. national game.
