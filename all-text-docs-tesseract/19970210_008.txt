Nothing Like Africa...

In an age in which America is
trying to deal with race matters its
very perturbing to listen to the man-
ner in which diversity issues are
treated under the guise of freedom
of speech. From the O.J. court pro-
ceedings to the marginalization of
diverse groups at this very distin-
guished institution of higher learn-
ing, we the African students at
Davidson have quietly pondered the
very questions this country contin-
ues to battle with. While we admit
that a great deal of progress has
been made (whether in the ability
for students from diverse back-
grounds to voice their opinions or
in the formulation of such struc-
tures as diversity classes and fo-
rums), there is a lot to be desired.

Faced with a campus that is
relatively naive in dealing with di-
versity, we have had to experience
first hand the stereotypes that tend
to be associated not only with blacks
but also with peoples from the so
called “Third World.” We felt com-
pelled to keep an open mind given
our status as outsiders. But the ap-
pearance of an article in last week’s
Davidsonian has placed us in a po-
sition where we can no longer let
our complacency consume us.

Inher article entitled “Nothing
like the Third World...,”’ Katherine
Okey casually describes how “five

little white girls” venture into the
South Western region of Uganda
amidst a trail of personal experi-
ences, as an “escape” from their
program in Kenya. We do feel that
study-abroad programs such as the
one they were on, provide a better
understanding of other nations just
as we ourselves have come to com-
prehend that America is beyond

that led to the local folks to stare at
you in a queer manner? You also
make it seem like you were the first
White people Ugandans had come
into contact with. Uganda has a
long history dealing with Whites
particularly following the declara-
tion of Uganda as a British colony
in 1884. So the kind of reception
you got does not in anyway reflect

remarkable to the extent that many
analysts predict that with a stable
elected government, the country
may emerge out of its economic
doldrums. We do not want to make
a case for Uganda but rather spot-
light these facts to show how Okey’s
article failéd to address some of the

issues that would have better pro-

vided Davidson community mem-

Hollywood and
McDonalds. However,
the story told by Okey, is
notonly distorted, but fur-
ther reinforces the stereo-
type of Africa: that the
only thing positive about
Africa is its animal popu-
lation. In fact, the humans

bers; who are not famil-
iar with this part of the
world with a fair assess-
ment. We would like to
further add that in the
haste to judge an entire
country, our fellow stu-
dent contributed to some
of the ignorance about
African issues that still

counter are simply made to look
“crazy.” It is here that we would
like to ask Okey: Did you take time
out during your travels to acquire
some facts about the East African
nation of Uganda rather than limit
yourself to making fun ofits people?

We find it distasteful that de-
spite the amount of guidance and
assistance accorded to you on your
trip, you show no respect for local
customs by simply using “Third
World” status as the source of your
supposedly rough trip. Did you for
a moment stop to ask whether per-
haps it was your lack of sensitivity

the attitudes of people in develop-
ing countries but may be a result of
your individual contempt for your
hosts.

Perhaps many of our readers
will recall that Uganda is emerging
from one of the worst civil conflicts
that left much of its infrastructure
damaged. The presence of dilapi-
dated roads in the rural areas of
south western Uganda should not
be looked at by foreigners with hu-
mor but rather as a grim reminder of
how disastrous war can be. In fact
Uganda’s recovery efforts in the
aftermath of the war have been very

lingers around in our modern day
society.

This point is illustrated in her
conversation with embassy officials
in Kampala. To the extent that she
can ask as to whether it is safe for
women to travel in that part of the
world, illuminates her preconcep-
tion about the state of women in
Uganda, Like the United States,
Uganda has made it a top priority to
ensure the safety of women in all
parts of the country. To this effect
the Ugandan government. has'en-
trusted its very own female vice-

women.

We are left to speculate that
maybe you didn’t have the time to
dig into some of this information.
Nevertheless, the fact that you could
have the audacity to make fun of the
fine African foods such as mchomo
is not any different from what the
nineteenth century colonialists said
about the “dark continent.”

In the absence of political cor-
rectness it would therefore not be
surprising to us if this same attitude
were exhibited to the ethnic groups
discriminated against in this devel-
oped nation. We believe that as one

‘of the top institutions in this coun-

try, Davidson’s standards on issues
of diversity should be exemplary.

We do not suggest that people
align themselves on either the left
or right, but should be human. This
means the treatment of those of us
who constitute a small percentage
of the student body yet represent a
wide array of backgrounds on this
campus necessitates a reexamina-
tion. Perhaps our imperialistic atti-
tudes toward people who are not
part of the mainstream culture may
explain the great rift among the
races in this country today. In any
event, we do believe that in the
name of free speech, Other people’s
beliefs and values ought not be
trampled upon.

- Brothers and sisters, I’ve come
around to a new way of thinking —
I’ve had what alcoholics call a “‘mo-
ment of clarity.”

Now, my moment of clarity
had nothing to do with alcohol or
alcoholism, so don’t get your pant-
ies in a bunch and worry that I’m
about to get preachy about the dan-
gers of drinking. I’m not.

No, my moment of clarity was
concerning my own prejudice,
blindness, fatheadedness, and hy-
pocrisy concerning friends and fel-
low students. It happened like this:

I’ve got an internship at Cre-
ative Loafing this semester, and last
Monday the managing editor called
me into his office and asked if I
wanted to write a news story about

. aclub that the police had raided on
January 31.

Itold him Id be glad to, and so
on Tuesday afternoon I drove down
to Wilkinson Blvd. to check out the
club, called The Septic Tank. I met
the guy who runs it, asurly Gen-Xer
clad entirely in black with purple
dread locks and enough hunks of
metal sticking out of his face to
build a Volkswagen engine, if you
were to melt them down and had
sufficient metal-casting and engine-

building skills. ‘
He walked me into the club,
and the first thing I noticed was the
overwhelming smell of urine and

must say that in my blue jeans,
corduroy shirt, and cowboy boots, I
felt a little bit out of place.

Then Mr. I-Didn’t-Realize-
That-If-the-Good-Lord-Had-In-
tended-Us-To-Have-Hair-the-
Color-of-Vomit-After-a-Grape-
Electric-Jello-Party-He-Would-
Have-Given-It-To-Us, along with
his two bizarre-as-all-hell buddies,
proceeded to explain to me how
undercover vice agents had busted
them for Sextacy, a party whose
events included sex-slave rentals
(i.e. prostitution), onstage body
piercings, anda hundred dollar prize
for the most unusual stage act.

The police arrested a handful
of people for crimes against nature
and indecent exposure, and the al-
ternative trio sitting in front of me
lamented the fact that the police
were picking on them and being
puritanical.

They talked about the impor-
tance of celebrating eroticism,
which we all know is just an artsy.
way of saying you’re horny and
don’t need a good excuse.

‘left The Septic Tank, hopped
into my car, pulled on my Univer-
sity of Tennessee baseball cap, and
turned on the radio to 96.9, a coun-
try station, which I cranked up as I
pulled out of the parking lot in an
attempt to ease my nerves.

Then I went to the government
district downtown to get a copy of

Greg Garrison

An Alternative to Alternative

the police report. Not being from a
big city, I was awestruck by the tall
buildings and hugeness of the
Mecklenburg County government
and how I felt like I was in a movie,
since I had never been in a real-life
huge police station. :

It made me feel damn proud t
be an American.

Anyway, I came home after
that, and when I set foot on Davidson
soil, I thought back to the people I
had met and thought about life at
Davidson.

That’s when I had my moment
of clarity; I realized that I’ve been
prejudiced against the clean-cut
people around here who have the
same taste and style.

I smiled and said, “God bless
normality.”

Now, I’ vecomplained for years
about how we’re all too similarhere,
but when it comes right down to it,
I’m not any different than anybody
else. I dress the same way, act the
same way, talk the same way, and
listen to the same music as most

‘people around here. Let me tell
y’all — after meeting those fruit-
cakes on Wilkinson Blvd., Ican say
with a big smile and a sincere heart,
that that’s a good thing. Before
talking to them, I never realized that
I like Eddie Bauer and L.L. Bean.

I’ve always thought of myself

as being alittle bit “alternative,” but
I’mreally nothing more than acoun-

president to deal with the state of

try boy with longish hair who tries
to have an open mind and dreams of
living the glorious, glamorous life
of a beach bum novelist. I love
Jimmy Buffett and John Grisham. I
love Tommy Boy and Lonesome
Dove and testosterone-laden action
flicks.

I love being showered and
clean-shaven. [love the taste of hot
dogs and cheap beer. I love smiling
and winking at people and seeing
the world as a place that’s not all

that bad, if you can keep from being
irritated by all the boneheads, numb-
skulls, and rebels with or without
causes.

Why, I couldn’t be closer to
mainstream American culture if I
tried.

For years now, I’ ve been think-
ing I was alternative, but after tak-
ing a look at the extreme, I can say
that I’d just as soon be what I am
and what most everybody here is —
an alternative to alternative.
