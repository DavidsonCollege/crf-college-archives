CROP support

By DON BENSON
Associate Editor

Davidson College conducts two
major programs at Broughton
State Mental Hospital in
Morganton, N.C. An eight-week
summer course involves a
maximum of twenty students
spending from twenty to twenty
five hours per week in the
hospital.

The Psychology 231 class,
Advanced Abnormal, spends
one day per week during the
term at Broughton Hospital.

As leader of both programs,
Professor of Psychology W.G.
Workman explained, ‘“‘We’ve
had these opportunities for
about four years now. Over the
past few years I’ve heard of
several schools adding such

programs, but when we started
ours at Davidson I had heard of

only three others.’’

Friday fast to prompt
assistance for starving

“Over 3.7 billion people are going without
food. By fasting we hope to gain a sense of
brotherhood with these people and a sense of
duty,’’ said Bill Bond, co-organizer for the
Davidson Good Friday fast.

This fast, planned by the Eumenian Society
and others under the direction of Bob Mooty in-
cludes asking for donations to alleviate hunger
in the world. The money will go to CROP, an
organization dedicated to fighting world hunger.

“‘We plan to set up tables in front of Belk and
in Chambers to accept donations,”’ Bond said.

Director of ARA Food Services Ron Scott has
also offered to help with the fast.

‘People who normally eat at Slater can sign
up to fast. Half of the profit of what they would
have eaten will go to CROP,”’ said Bond.

Mooty indicated that an offering for CROP
will be given by the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church. ‘‘Rush Otey and John
Rogers have been a great help to us.

‘‘Rush was the initial impetus for the program
and helped with the date selection,’’ said Mooty.

“Obviously there’s religious significance to
Good Friday, but we want support from

everyone. This is not just a Christian issue but a
human issue.”’

The initiators of the fast say that they would
like response from students other than just
money. :

‘Pity can be cheap.”’

“Only by going hungry can one understand
and empathize with those who are hungry. Pity
can sometimes be cheap,” said Bond.

“The organization does not concern itself with
converting people, but only with getting them
food,’’ said Mooty.

“Now, the area of most need is in the Sahel
region in Africa. There has been a seven year
drought in that area, which is right next to the
Sahara Desert.

“People there are dying from starvation,”
Mooty said.

“CROP money will go there. CROP also helps
in India, parts of America, and other hungry
areas of the world,” he added.

$3000 goal

The goal for the money-raising aspect of the
fast is between $2500 and $3000, according to
Mooty. ‘‘I don’t want the idea of the fast to die
out,”’ he said.

six students. Class is conducted
in the car on the way to
Morganton.

“We used to allow only five
students, but this year I got
hold of a station-wagon,”’ said
Workman.

Broughton State Mental
Hospital has about 1640 pa-
tients in a wide variety of
programs. While at the
hospital, students are com-
monly given the opportunity to
observe some form of group
therapy program.

Workman added, ‘We try to
let each student establish friend-
ly relations with at least one
patient. This requires about a
minimum of one hour every
week. We also attend and par-
ticipate in the hospital’s weekly
recreational activities, which is
usually a dance.”’

Students keep a journal of
their experiences con-
centrating on an evaluation of
the hospital’s program, an ac-
count of changes in the patients,
and a criticism of the course.

The term grade rests
primarily on a term paper; the
topic utilizing the student’s ex-
periences. ‘We make an effort
to avoid the kind of paper that
could be done without visiting
the hospital,’’ said Workman.

“This term students are in-
volved with geriatrics, a token
economy, and intermediate
care units. A token economy
unit is geared toward training
the patient for normal living
with the hope of getting the in-
dividual out of Broughton.

‘“‘Those who need _in-
termediate care are seriously
disordered individuals. These
people require considerable

supervision and are in locked .

wards.”

During the eight-week sum-
mer program, students are
housed at the normal staff fac-
ilities. Credit is given for Psy-
chology 131 and 231.

Workman said, ‘‘This entails
an intensive one week _in-
troduction to abnormal
psychology and an orientation
to the hospital that includes
visiting the wards.”’

Psychology students establish
friendly relations at Broughton

A ninety minute class is
given each day with members
of the Broughton staff presen-
ting lectures about once a
week. ‘‘Here the students work
as aides, attendants, and
technicians while servicing the
wards,” said Workman. -

“They are rotated among at
least four different activities.
This can involve the ad-
missions ward, where the
patient is diagnosed; active
treatment areas moving
toward an expected early
release; community placement
where transfer to a nursing
home is likely; token economy
areas concentrating on special
behavior modifications; or
possibly the youth activities
center.”

Students have close contact
with the Broughton staff.
Besides a weekly lecture, Dr.
Workman said, ‘We try to
work each student into an on-
going therapy group at the
hospital. This gives them a
close contact with the
professional staff.”

Workman estimated that
“about a third of the par-
ticipating students are in-
terested in graduate work in
psychology.

“The others are moving
toward other fields such as
medicine, the ministry, or
some other form of counseling.
We still have some openings for
the program this summer.”
