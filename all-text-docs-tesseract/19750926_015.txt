... Harris parties

(continued from page 2)

Harris used a typical evening
cocktail party as an example of
the mediocrity of American
society.

“You get the people together
at a party and the talk there is
simply appalling. You wouldn't
believe it- the crab grass, the
golf scores, the crap and the
crap. And you'd think these
people are absolute nothings.

“If you take them out to
dinner, couple by couple, and
talk to them, you find out that
there is a lot more there to
them. They’ve got ideas,
they've got imagination, their
standards are better; but this is
all private.

“When they get together

nobody wants to hurt anyone’s
feelings, nobody wants to have
an argument, nobody wants to
be thought different.

“And so everyone stays at a
very safe, comfortable, benign,
dull level, even when individ-
ually they are much brighter
and more sensitive than you
would ever imagine from seeing
them as a group.”

He noted that Robert
Huchens said that “education is
education about values, or it is
nothing.” He then concluded
with a thought as to where
those values must come from.

“Education on values does
not come from the schools. It
comes from the rest of the
country. The schools take their
color from the country.”

... secretaries desire benefits

(continued from page 3)

revamping of the various job
categories is needed.

“It would be nice if the
administration would come up
with a committee composed
partly of secretaries and partly
of administrators in order to
reevaluate these job descrip-
tions,” said one secretary.

“Everyone would like to see
something concerning these job
descriptions in writing, but we
want what’s written down to be
clear and unambiguous,” re-
marked another secretary.

Stephenson, on the other

~ hand, maintains that the bulk of

the employment policies are
formulated and need only “to be
gathered together into the
handbook.”

“The faculty has long had
access to the college’s tuition
exhange program. It provides

us with the benefit of allowing
our children to come to
Davidson, if accepted, tuition
free.

“Furthermore, our children
may attend tuition-free various
other universities and colleges
which are partners. with
Davidson in the tuition ex-
change program,” explained
one faculty member.

Members of the college
hourly-paid staff are not eli-
gible to participate inthe
tuition exchange program.

“They qualify for the waver
of tuition payment for depen
dent children accepted for ad-
mission to Davidson College,”
stated Stephenson.

The Chambermaids maintain
that they are in need of some
type of financial assistance to
help defray the costs of finan-
cing their children’s college
educations.

“Many of the secretaries’
children can’t gain admittance
at Davidson but still want to
attend college.

“Many of the girls feel,
especially with the salaries we
make--even lower than the
professors-- that we need finan-
cial help,” commented a sec-
retary.

Although a majority of the
secretaries interviewed ex-
pressed an interest in being
eligible for the tuition exchange
program, many agreed that
“the establishment of a loan
program would greatly ease the
financial burden of meeting the
costs of their children’s college
tuition bills.”

Stephenson agreed that the
availability of the tuition waver
system was “a step in the right
direction.”
