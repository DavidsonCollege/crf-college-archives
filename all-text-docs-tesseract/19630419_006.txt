tion of recent. happenings in
Southeast Asia by Dr. Paul A.
Marrotte, and readings of ori-
ginal poetry by Davidson stud-
ents.

Discussing the first year of
broadcasting, Ivey says: “Con-
that we began last
November with a hazy: idea of
| our goals for the program, anda
limited list of program mater-
ials, I couldn't be disappointed
| with the results.”

WBT has indicated that
they also have found the pro-
gram successful. The show
has attracted letters from as
far away as Mississippi and
Vermont.

Ivey will continue the show
next year and has plans for the
future: “I hope to be able to
use more of our faculty mem-
bers and students on programs
of an academic nature. I also
want to use more student crea-
tivity in our programs: radio
plays, monologues, readings of
papers—that sort of thing. Good
presentations will not only be a
credit to the college, but they
can be of value to the student as} |
well. ;

“I hope that people will offer
more suggestions for the pro-
gram in the future. In it, we as
a school have the opportunity
both to establish an image of

idson in the minds of many
who would never have other-
wise heard the name of the col-
lege, and to help inform the
public of the interests, issues,
and attitudes prevalent among
college students in our nation.”
