that the man will be one who is closely re-

Another point of interest of the 1928
“Quips and Cranks” will be the art work.
Before all the art work has been done by
professionals, but this year the staff has de-
cided to let it be done by the students. There
seems to be sufficient talent in the college
that it ought to be done very efficiently and
much more cheaply.

Dr. William Joseph Martin, Jr., ’23, will
be located at Northeastern Hospital, Al-
legheny Avenue and Tulip Street, Phila-
delphia, until Ja’.uary 1st. After that
time he will be located at the Episcopal
Hospital, Philadelphia.

served overseas for more than two years,

During his service in the Near East,
he had some trying experiences, especial-
