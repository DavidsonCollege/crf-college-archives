Officials Improve
Campus Appearance

At the recent meeting of the board of trus-
tees the college officials were authorized to
spend a good deal of money for the beauti-
fication of the campus. In accordance with
this plan a number of improvements have
been made within the past few weeks.

Chief among these improvements has been
the sowing of grass in the bare places on the
campus. During the past week these have
been thoroughly worked over and fertilized

so that at the first sign of warm weather they |

should be thoroughly covered over with grass.
It has been requested that the boys ‘keep to
the walks as much as possible-as the grass is
especially tender at this time of the year.

Grass ‘is also being sown in front of the new
'

Chambers building.

All of the trees on the campus have been
gone over and put in shape for the year.
A large number of dead limbs have been
trimmed off and holes have been cemented.

The ground just in front of the two lit-
erary society halls has been gone over. The
rocks have been removed and grass has been
sown. Further improvements will shortly
be made and the campus will no doubt be in
good shape for Junior Speaking.

Danner Mahood, ‘22, has completed his

Ph.D, in English from University of Vir-
ginia and is now field secretary for the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity.

Figures From Infirmary Show That
Sickness at Davidson is Not as
Widespread as Formerly

There has been a great deal of sickness
over the campus during the last two weeks.
There seems to be an epidemic of both
mumps and flu. Both are very mild, how-
ever, and thus far no one has been seriously
ill.

The epidemic of mumps came first and the
infirmary was soon filled with mump_ pa-
tients. As soon as the flu began to spread
to any extent these patients were moved out
of the infirmary and put into the parlor of
West. Those patients who had flu were then
put in the infirmary.

There have been about 25 cases of mumps
