IMAC Cage Tourney Set

By HOWARD BOYD
Asst. Sports Editor

The SPEs, Delts and Mav-
ericks each won three straight
matches and jumped off to early
leads in IMAC handball play.

Led by stellar performer Buzz
Tarver, the SPEs topped the
Taus 2-1, Watts I! 2-1 and Pax
1 3-0, and stand alone atop
League B.

The Delts and Mavericks are
tied for first in League A, just
ahead of Fanny & Mabel, which
is 2-0 with one match unreport-
ed.

The Delt team of Ross Ma-
nire, Jim Hankinson, Tom Trax-
ler and Frank McShane blanked
both Emanon and Pax 3 2-0,
then edged the Pikas 2-1.

The Mavericks, a team com-
posed of Bernard Scoggins, Russ
Merritt, Kurt Geisinger and
Robert Brice, have yet to be
scored upon. They whitewashed
Cannon 11, SAE and Emanon in
succession.

F&M, behind Lynn Wagner
and Davis Beaston, shut out Can-
non II and Pax 3 and CII, with
their third round match against
theE‘’s not yet reported.

Behind the SPEs in League
B, Watts II and Pax I are tied
at 2-1, with the Klutzes and Be-
tas 1-1, pending the outcome of
their third-round match.

Watts II (John Gabriel, Todd
Chapman, Tom Kot and Mitch-
ell Stone), won over the Klutzes
by forfeit (in a game which
may be replayed), amd after
losing to SPE, edged Pax 2 2-1.

The Pax I team of Charlie
Slagle and Steve Earp shut out
the Betas and Taus before los-
ing to the SPEs.

Meanwhile, in IMAC basket-
ball, Porter’s knocked off Em-
anon | and the SPEs to emerge
as the only unbeaten team after
regular-season play.

Balanced scoring paced a 60-

Wildcat Marksmen
Travel To Wofford

The Wildcat rifle team takes
aim at Wofford today, in search
of their second victory of the
season.

After losses to nationally-rank-
ed powers Clemson and N. C.
State, the ’Cat shooters are 1-5
on the year.

Max Thomason fired a 253,
second-high for the match, to
pace the Davidson squad to its
only win, Jan. 14 against Pres-
byterian.

That victory avenged an earli-
er setback at the hands of the
Blue Hose.

Thomason has led the rifle-
men in each of their last three
meets, firing 255 against Clem-
son and 252 versus N. C. State.

With the improvement of
fresmen shooters Garry Frank
and Jim Fagan, plus the return
to form of Larry Crowell, who
missed last year, the marks-
men look for better results in
the future.

After the Wofford match, the
team again travels to Spartan-
burg, S. C., for the Western Car-
olinas Conference Invitational

Wildcats, with the only great
threat coming from The Cita-
del.
