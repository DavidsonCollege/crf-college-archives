Davidson Represented at Interest-
ing Gathering.

The Y. M. C. A. Conference of the
Colleges of North Carolina met in Wes.
Raleigh on the 23rd, 24th and 25th oi
this month. ‘Trinity, Wake Forest,
Trinity Park, Elon, Guilford, A. & M.,
University of N. C., and Davidson weie
represented.

‘Lhe conference opened at the Y. M.
C. A. building of A. & M. College, with
twenty-six delegates in attendance.
Amid much enthusiasm, Mr. H. D. El-
liot, of the International Committee,
made an address, followed by other
speakers.

The meeting was called to order
again on Saturday morning. Mr. Elliot
spoke on Bible and Mission Study. Aft-
er this there was the regular round table
conference and reports from the repre-
sentatives. Professor “Trawick, Sccre-
tary of the Committee on Social Service
in the South, gave an interesting talk on
this phase of the work and pointed out
the need for action by all the students
in its promotion, The discussion of the
Blue Ridge Conference held the atten-
tion of all. Definite results were re-
ported by the various representatives,
and it appears that a much larger dele-
gation than that of last year will attend
this summer.

The meetings on Saturday afternoon
and Sunday were characterized by the
same enthusiasm and the attendance of
both delegates and townspeople. By the
helpful discussion and. planning — for
greater results new intcrest was aroused.
The next year promises great things for
the Y. M. C. A.’s of our State,

J. B. Daffin and J. T. Maddrey rep-

resented Davidson -at the conference.

pole is to be something like a hundred
feet high and set in a concrete base in

PROHIBITION DISCUSSED
AT JOINT MEETING

The Ministerial and Volunteer Band:
joined with the Christian Endeavor So-
ciety in its regular weekly meeting last
Sunday evening. The’ topic for discus-
sion was “The Saloon the Foe of So-
ciety.” The leader, J. A. Thames, gave
some interesting facts showing the prog
ress that prohibition has made. in the
United States. He and a number o1
other speakers emphasized the evil ef-
fects, physically, economically and mor-
ally produced by even a small amount
of liquor.

‘The question, Why has the saloon not
yet been eradicated ? put before the meet-
ing by the president of the society,
brought forth a number of pointed re-
plies.

‘Lhe entire discussion showed that al-
tho the liquor question is an old prob-
lem, it has lost none of its interest.

PIPE AND ‘TUBE MAKING
SHOWN IN PICTURES

A very interesting and attractive film
was shown last I*riday night in Sheare:
Hall thru the courtesy of the Nationa:
‘Lube Company.

Practically all of the students as wel)
as a good many of the town peuple took
the advantage of seeing the piocess thru
which the iron ore is converted inte.
steel.

A representative of the company gave
a very interesting lecture in connection
with the history, character and product:
of the company.

After the regular show, a reel o!
films showing the welfare work being
done by this company was shown.

We disapprove of any school using
profanity in their yells. It only casts
reflections upon your own school and
it is not a bit “cute.” Quite recently we
attended a football game where profan-
ity was used in the yells by a student
body which was supposed to be a Chris:
tian college. We dare to say that they
lost many students by that yell besides
lowering their own = moral standard.

‘Most college students think it is “cute”

to use profanity in yells, but we beg of
you not to use it, for it is anything but
cute. We are glad to say that we can’t
remember the day when such yells have
been used on Furman’s field by Furman
students. We venture to say we are
above that and we hate to see any cal-
lege lower itself by such foolish yells.
Tt is the right thing to do when you yell
and holler, supporting your team, but
we would leave out the profanity.—Ex.

A TEST.

A professor in the University of Chi-
cago told his pupils that he should con-
sider them educated, in the best sense of
the word, when they would say yes to
every one of fourteen questions he
should put to them. It may be of inter-
est to you to read the questions. Here
thev are:

Has vour education given sympathy
with all good causes and made you es-
pouse them?

Has it made you public-spirited ?

Has it made you a brother to the weak ?

Have you learned ‘how to make
friends and keep them?

Do you know what it is to be a friend
yourself ?

Can you look an honest man or a pure
woman straight in the eye?

Do you see anything to love in a little
hild.

Will a lonely dog follow you in the
treet ?

Can you be high-minded and happy in
the meaner drudgeries of life?

Do you think washing dishes and hoc-
ing corn just as campatable with high
thinking as piano playing or golf?

Are you good for anything to your-
self?

Can you be happy, alone?

Can you look out on the world and
see anything except dollars and cents?

Can you look into a mud puddle by
the wayside and see anything in the pud-
He but mud?

Can you look into the sky at night
and see beyond the stars? Can your
soul claim relationship with the Cre-
ator ?—Selected.
