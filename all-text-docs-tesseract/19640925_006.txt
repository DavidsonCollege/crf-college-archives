If you’ve seen some wild-
eyed economics majors
coming out of Rooms 132
and 229 Chambers Building
latelv. its only because
they've just seen their new
professor, Dr. C. L. Nelson,
but the initials stand for

“Cora Louise!”

Davidson's only female facul-
ty ‘member comes from Hender-
son, by way of the University
of North Carolina, where she

received her BS and PhD in eco-
nomies.- While attending UNC,

she distinguished jerself by
winning numerous fellowships,
including the Harold Stonier
Fellowship in Banking, marking
the first time this award has
been won by a woman.

Not satisfied with this
achievement, however, Dr. Nel-
son has now gatned the lofty
distinction of being the only fe-
male member of the Davidson
faculty. Fortunately for her
students. She seems to feel no
need to prove herself. In fact.
she’s completely unaffected by
the whole thing.

Being in a field where there
are few women. she is used to
being in. and teaching all-boy
“They look just Jike
other classes to me.” she said.
She does. however, make one

distinction. between Davidson

classes and others she has:

, taught: “I would expect ‘them :

to be. much better.” '

In commenting on being sur."
rounded by the men of the Dav
idson faculty and student body.
Dr. Nelson pointed out that she
was not the first to break the
sex barrier, referring specific-
ally to a biology lab instructor
from last year. “I'm sort of out-
numbered. but it has been done
before," she quipped.

Besides being impressed with
the Davidson student. Dr. Nel-
son remarked that her reception
by the ‘Davidson gentleman”
has been “extremely cordial.”
She looks forward to developing
this relationship with her stud-
ents, starting with faculty visita-
tions in October.

She nevertheless posed an in-
direct worning to her students:
“When asked about the David-
son student body as a whole.
she observed, “The good stud-
-ents around here, that's pretty
nice." . Then she paused, and
continued. ‘“‘I hope Ill be able
to say the same thing Jater!”

who are interested in applying
are urged by Dr. J. O. Embry,

‘| Davidson Fulbright Advisor, to

pleted by the end of October,

“and this is a lengthy process.

Scholarships for consideration.

More than 900 graduate grants
to 53 countries are available
through the U. S. Department
of State’s educational exchange
program, which is authorized by
the Fulbright-Hays Act. A full

and James Nichols of the same
class was awarded a teaching
assistantship to Pakistan. In
the class of ‘62, Joe Robinson
won a Fulbright to Germany,
and Andy Vance won. a teach-
ing assistantship to France.

inter-American relations, the
United states government is of-
fering special opportunities to
U. S. students for study in Latin
America.

sored by the Rotary Club are al-
so available for study abroad.

The sleepy village of Davidson is not what it used

to be.

Gone is Pop Copeland's

by Mrs. Bryant Sigmon, who has left to her husband her
work at the Coffee Cup Restaurant, the store fulfills a

lifelong ambition for her.

The old Jungle, now known
as Copeland's, has replaced Ma-
rietta’s, formerly a women's
apparel shop.

The gutted skeleton of Mc-
Kissick’'s Shoe Shop makes a
grim appearance on Main
Street. A fire on the night of
August 21 destroyed the small
shop and $1,300 worth of new
ghoes that were stored in the
back. Sparked by a faulty wire,
the fire spread to an adjacent
real estate office and damaged
it heavily. Mr. McKissick con-

work in his brother’s shop in
