Charlotte Stars outlast injury-ridden Wildcats in exhibition

By MIKE ANDERSON
Editor Emeritus

In an exhibition marked by a multitude of
lead-changes and momentum shifts, the Wild-
cats found themselves behind 78-65 at the
final buzzer to even their pre-season exhibi-
tion mark at 1-1.

“You don’t like losing any games—exhi-
bition or otherwise,” said head coach John
Filar. “But we saw some nice positive things
tonight. I’m much happier with this perfor-
mance than (last week’s 89-74 victory over
the Asheville Rage).”

The Wildcats took a 39-24 lead into the
half-time locker room and held onto that lead

with twelve minutes to play, but the Char- .

lotte Rage—a semi-professional team com-
prised of aging but big-name women’s
hoopsters, including a WNBA veteran—ran
away with it from there, outscoring Davidson
35-20 to wind out*the game. The Rage’s
‘India Adams knocked down a shot-clock
beating baseline fadeaway with 1:25 to play,
giving the Rage a 68-60 lead and effectively
sealing the deal.
Davidson entered the contest with a woe-
fully depleted lineup: freshmen Lindsay
Shade (Achilles tendonitis) and Courtney
Laird (mononucleosis) joined already-injured

Bethany Schott and D’Erica Taylor in street
clothes for the contest. Shade is day-to-day,
but Laird will be sidelined for at least two
weeks. ;
And many of those in uniform were far
from one hundred percent—less than three
hours before tip-off,
Janna Magette was in
a chiropractor’s of-
fice with a strained
back and Kelly
Copland was at the
emergency room for
X-rays on an injured
wrist. :
“Wecame into this
lineup really banged
up,” said Filar.
‘When I came over
at the beginning of
the game—I ex-
pected Magette and
Copland to be injured
andI thought we were
going to have to go’
with eight players.”
Among the bright spots on the afternoon,

senior center Jessica Heath scored 15 points ©

and grabbed 4 rebounds, going an impressive
5-6 from both the floor and the free-throw

line.
The game also marked a big step for the
return of junior forward Leah Uhernik.

Uhernik, coming off ACL surgery, grabbed

11 defensive boards and knocked downa pair
of clutch three-pointers late in the game.

Janna Magette
overcame the back
injury to~- pace
Davidson with 21
points—she com-
mitted just one turn-
over in 36 minutes
of guard play.

And one of the
most promising
bright spots on the
day was the play of
first-year point guard
Ashley Hallsted.

charge along the sideline, received the in-
bound pass and proceeded to splash a three-
pointer from the arc to keep Davidson in
contention.

“Ashley is going to be tough down the
stretch of any game,” said Filar. “She has that
mental discipline and that focus you need
when you’re in a tight game and need a big
performance.”

Fellow freshman Robyn Flewelling, a for-
ward from Okemos, Mich., also turned in a
fine performance. “Flewelling showed some
real bright spots today,” said Filar. “She’s
starting to get some more confidence—when
she settles in and begins to feel comfortable,
you'll see that she will become the kind of
slashing player that we need.”

The Wildcats trek to Florida next weekend
to open up regular season play at Jackson-
ville University (Saturday) and Stetson (Mon-
day).

The trip marks a homecoming for senior

captain JoAnne Hassel. “JoAnne has been
tremendous for this program,” said Filar. “It
should be a happy homecoming for her. I
hope The Bolles School turns out. They
should be extremely proud of the young lady
they’ve sent here.” :
