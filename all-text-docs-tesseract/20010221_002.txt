compete i in modeling challenge

By BRENT BYARS

Last Monday at midnight, a group of Math
majors finished work on a very real problem.
They were asked to make a new evacuation
plan for South Carolina’s coastal residents in
the event of a hurricane. State officials in S.
C. have not suddenly turned to Davidson’s
undergrads for help. Instead, DC is joining
universities and elite high schools from around
the nation in the 17" Annual Mathematical
Contest in Modeling. The contest is spon-
sored by the Consortium for Mathematics
and its Appli-
cations, and
seeks to “chal-
lenge... stu-
dents to
clarify, ana-
lyze, and pro-
pose solutions
to open-ended
problems.”

Dr Laurie
Heyer, the
groups’ spon-
sor in. the
project, noted
that DC has
competed in
the past, and
received hon-
orable mention. She notes, however, that DC
has not competed for the last several years.
Dr Heyer is also looking for to competing
with schools that traditional rival Davidson,
including Duke University and the Univer-
sity of North Carolina.

The organization each year provides two
problems and 4 days to teams of students and
asks them to propose and explain a solution to
a real-life problem. This year, two teams of
students began work on the project. Reflect-
ing a growing emphasis on technology-driven
problem solving, both teams decided to use
computer programs to solve their problems.

they tried to extend it to the entire problem.
“It was really disapointing that we worked all
weekend and it didn’t work out the way we
hoped.” said Joe Rusinko. ;

Dr. Heyer was sorry to see the team fail to
complete their project, although she applauded
their efforts and added that they did “a phe-
nomenal amount of work.” The other team
used the computer program Mathematica and
techniques learned in Dr. Heyer’s modeling
class to solve the problem. Dr Heyer added
that the team worked up until the deadline,
handing the final drafts into her 15 minutes

before mid-
night on Mon-
day.

As part of the
competition,
the group wrote
a proposed
press release,
announcing the
development of
a new evacua-
tion plan for S.

&. The press
releases evalu-
ates the effec-
tiveness of em-
ploying a sys-
tem by which
coastal-bound

lanes would be used to alleviate traffic con-
cerns and suggests that S.C. prohibit the
evacuation of non-essential recreational ve-
hicles and build more shelters on the evacu-
ation route. -

The team will receive results back around
April 1, when the organization will rank the
entries on a scale from “successful partici-
pant” to “outstanding.” The best solutions
are published, and its writers will receive an
unspecified cash prize and membership to
Mathematics organizations. Dr Heyer em-
phasizes that it is most important for Davidson
to seek recognition on a national level, espe-
cially in these types of academic competition.

Damage to property 2/18/01

Officer responded to the Sigma Alpha
