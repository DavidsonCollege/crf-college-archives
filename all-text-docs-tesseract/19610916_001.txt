son’s advanced ROTC classes
this year is the largest in the
college's history — 266. Tues-
day will be organization day
and “things will really kickoff
the following Tuesday,” Capt.
Threlkeld said.

The only major change in the
Davidson College ROTC Corps
for the Fall Semester of 1961-
62 is that the new Professor of
Military Science and Tactics,
Lt. Colonel Paul R. Wheaton,
will be instructing the MS II's.

In explaining his added duty
of instructor, Colonel Wheaton
pointed out that the Davidson
Corps is currently short two
officers — both Majors. How-
ever, he is expecting these va-
cancies to be filled during this
school-year.

SUMMER CAMP

Capt. Threlkeld, instructor
for juniors who attended the
training camp at Fort Bragg, re-
ported only one casualty among
the 110 participants — Pat
Rush lost a tooth in parachute
training.

Although Davidson ‘placed no
top individuals in competition
among men from 30 U. S. col-
leges and universities, numer-
ous outstanding team perform-
ances were noted after a myriad
of military training exercises.

Of the nine top M-1 firers,
three were from Davidson: Bob
Barringer and Marvin Rozear,
both members of the Wildcat
rifle team, and Bill Gerhardt.

Forty of Davidson’s 110 men
were honored as Distinguished
Military Students and local
cadets placed second as a team
to Wake Forest in rifling with
a 183 average, just three notch-
es below the sharpshooter class.

CHAMPION MAP READERS

As a group in map reading
Davidson topped all other
schools with 96.6 points out of
a possible 100. Five Davidson
men, including Cadet Col. Wray,
were picked for the colonel’s
orderly, a daily selection which
honored 38 men.

Ranking in the top 10 per cent
of their companies were 12.7
per cent of the Davidsonians
and 35.4 per cent of them placed
in the top one-third of their
companies.

The camp was at Fort Bragg
and began in June and contin-
ued through July. The men
took training in communica-
tions, map reading, rifle instruc-
tion, machine gun and mortar
firing, combat and reconnais-
sance ‘patrols and __ tactical
maneuvers, including a week-
long bivouac climaxed by a tac-
| tical attack on the “enemy.”

Today’s pledging brought to
a close one of the most hectic
Rush Weeks in recent years as
both semester classes and rush
parties began last Monday. The
first series of parties ran
through Wednesday night with
two nights of redates Thursday
and Friday. ‘

Cheers went up seconds after
3 p. m. when the first freshman
indicated his choice and con-
tinued until pledging closed at
4:30. The pledging period was
preceded by a period of silence
which went into effect last
night at 10 p. m. No rushee
could have further contact with
any fraternity man until the
close of pledging this afternoon.

The 79 per cent is slightly
below the comparable figure of
last fall, when 209 freshmen or

Rush Week. These totals were

altered somewhat with late
pledging.

the two Congolese students the

Enforcement Of Rules

By SAM FORT
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The Freshman Court, created
by the Student Council last
spring, will begin enforcing
freshman regulations tomorrow.
Bob Stone, current freshman
advisor, will be the judge. Other
members of the court are D. G.
Martin, Bob Moore, James
Davis, Larry Leafer, Danny
Carroll, Howard Arbuckle, and
Wiley Horn.

Stone said that the purpose of
the court is to help freshmen
become a part of Davidson by
encouraging them to demon-
strate a respectful attitude to-
ward the upperclassmen, each
other, and the Davidson tradi-
ion. This attitude will be demon-
strated by a willingness to ob-
serve the freshman regulations.

After months of study last
year the council abolished the
old Court of Control and or-
ganized the new court to re-
place it. One of the provisions
arising out of the council’s de-
cision was that the freshman
advisor serve as judge of the
court.

Behind the change in name
is a change in policy as regards
to purposes and methods. The
court will work jointly with the
Freshman Council, the Student

Council, the fraternity presi-
dents, and the administration.

Judge Stone feels that the
court should try to do some-
thing for the freshmen, not to
the freshmen. ‘The past Court
of Control had the reputation

Freshman Regulations

1. Freshmen must speak res-
pectively to everyone they mect
on campus.

2. Freshmen must wear the
prescribed nameplates at all
times on the campus and must
place namecards on the doors
of their dormitory rooms.

3. Freshmen must wear the
prescribed caps whenever out
of doors on campus.

4. Freshmen must not walk
on grass.

5. Freshmen must know al!
the college yells and songs by
the first pep rally; must at-
tend all pep rallies and when
on campus attend all fresh-
men and varsity home foot-
ball games.

6. All regulations shall be-
come effective on Sunday, Sept.
17.

7. Regulations shall be in ef-
fect until Thanksgiving unless
the Freshmen win the Field
Day, which shall be held on
Nov. 3.

having both athletes and non:
athletes.

Stone feels that for the!
Freshman Court to operate
properly it will need the cooper-

ation of the upperclassmen.

“The court doesn’t believe in
undue severity and certainly

not humiliation,” he said, “but

student body recognition of the
importance of freshman beha-
vior is effective. Unless the
upperclassmen will cooperate,
the court's program can be
more of a farce than a help. The
court is always open for sug-

gestions and criticisms from,

anyone in the student body.”
Stone particularly wants the

treshmen to know the policy of

the Freshman Court toward

riots. He said that the court will

see that there are no riots this'
year because of the danger to!

Any Congolese student com-
ing to Davidson will have to be
sponsored by the Board of

in the decision of the Board of
Trustees to have Congolese stu-
dents attend Davidson.

President D0. Grier Martin

lem as a cause for Neuba’s

Davidson for one year of col-

lege, there was no provision |

The question of academic eli-

mentioned, was also brought
out by Martin. Nsuba was not

high school he was attending,

President Martin said that
even allowing for some defi-
ciency because he was a for-
eign student, Nsuba- still
could not qualify academical-
ly for Davidson. “It would be
very unfortunate if our first
student had academic difficul-
ty,” Martin stated.

The Congolese Committee
did not meet this summer, al-
though some effort was made to
secure Nsuba during the sum-
mer, Rhodes explained. The
Congolese Committee is expec-
ted to continue its work this
year, but its activity will depend
on the encouragement it gets
from the Board of World Mis-
sions.

President Martin stated that
he expected the Board of World:
