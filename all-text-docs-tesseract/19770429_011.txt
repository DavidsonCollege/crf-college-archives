—— as
Bet you can’t understand English

By SIDNEY MYERS

To test your understanding of the
English language see how much sense
you can make out of the following
paragraph of “‘Britlish’’:

“From the underground{[1] we went
‘to queue[2] up for his lorry[{3}. He
lifted his bonnet{[4], ehecking under-
neath with his torch[5] for any defects
with his biro[6], dropping his rub-
ber{7] accidentally ashe did so. Inside’
he sat on his ice lolly[{8] and used a
serviette[9] to wipe off the mess from
his trousers[{10}. Now he was off,
behind a cafavan[11], round the
roundabout[12}. On his way, he went
past a solicitor{13] in a waistcoat[14]
gnd bowler[15], eating a Wimpy[16].
Beside him was a child in nappies[{17]
with a bag of sweets[18] which he

threw into the dustbin[{19]. They

were heading toward the Big Dip-
per[20], where he could get some
candy floss{21].

One cannot help but feel that Mark
Twain was right when he wrote
“Britain and America are two coun-
tries separated by a common lang-
uage’’. Experiences of the Rusk
Scholars bear witness to this fact and
the differences in the language have
caused quite a few problems for some
of them.

Patrick Macaskie, for. example,
walked casually into the Student
Store and asked the lady at the
counter for a “‘rubber’’. At first, she
pretended not to have hard him, but
could not hide her obvious embarrass-

ment. Patrick persisted, however,
pointing to the erasers under the
counter and the poor lady eventually
saw what he meant, just as Patrick
himself realized what-he had said.
Lucy Carlisle had an equally, if not
more, embarrassing experience on the
tennis courts, when she innocently
asked her opponent whether he
wished to ‘‘knock up”’ before their
game. The poor guy in question,

Nick Bitel spent five minutes

naturally, he asked for “‘chips’’, but of
course the guy serving did not have
the slightest idea what he was talking
about. ‘‘You know, those!,’’ said
Nick, pointing to the fries. ‘‘Oh, you
want French fries,” said the waiter.
“Yes, replied Nick, that’s what I
said, a bag of chips!”’

I have managed to overcome the
problem to a greater extent, owing to
the fact that I was in California for
two months before coming to David-
son and so had a chance to learn the

language! However, I still continue to
confuse people by asking for a
“biscuit” instead of a ‘‘cookie’’ and by
saying that I’m going to the “‘loo’’, a
common English colloquial term for
the lavatory. Believe me, I get the
strangest looks from people!

Not content with asking for ‘‘rub-
bers”’ in the Student. Store, Patrick
told me of another equally hilarious
incident which occurred at the begin-
ning of the term. Seeing someone with
a cigarette, he asked them if they had
a fag in theix‘mouth. The American
student, unaware that fag means
cigarette in England, looked at him
with amazement. Unable to under-
stand his astonishment, Patrick re-
peated the question and it was some

what he was talking about and
fortunately an international incident

was avoided!

the most trouble with her name. Her
first bank statement was addressed to
“Phillyspa Keil’, and she says most
Americans find it simpler to call her
“Pippa’’. However, she also had a lot
of trouble with clothes. Great confu-
sion “ensued. when. she told her
American roommate she was going to
put on a ‘‘jumper’’. ‘‘Jumper’”’ in
England means a ‘“‘sweater’’, while it
means what we call a “pinafore” in
America which in turn is called an
“apron” in England. Just to add to
the confusion, ‘‘overalls’’ in. this
country are known as ‘‘dungarees’’ in
England which apparently just mean
jeans or pants over here.

Neil Howlett, who has been to the
States several times before, remarked
that he has learned to avoid such
pitfalls, but pointed out that this is
his first. visit to this country when he
has not been asked whether he has
personally met either the Beatles or
the Queen (in that order!).
