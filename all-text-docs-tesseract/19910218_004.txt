1991 Student Government Association Elections: Questions & Answers

SGA Candidates Discuss Issues With The Davidsonian

Compiled and Edited
By David Thompson

On Wednesday, February 13,
the editorial board of The
Davidsonian met with the candi-
dates for SGA president and vice
president. At this meeting, each
candidate proffered a short list of
their qualifications for office, pre-
sented a three minute speech, and
answered various questions from
the editorial board for six minutes.

In order to provide the students
of Davidson with information
beneficial to the process of in-
formed and conscientious voting
in Tuesday’s election, we have
published the transcript of those
_ speeches, the candidates’ answers
to the questions proposed, and each
candidate’s list of qualifications.

The comments below are those
of the candidates. A few revisions
have been made in order to im-
prove the fluidity of the remarks
on paper. All changes have been
approved by the candidates prior
to the publication of this article.
Please address any comments you
have regarding the following statc-
ments to the candidates themselves.
The Davidsonian is only relaying
the comments of the candidates,
and is not responsible for any
misconceptions voiced by them.

Presidential
Candidates

Jacqueline Carberry
I’d like to begin by saying that
I think those of you who only see
me in passing, or don’t know me
very well, see the cheerful, light-
hearted and spirited side of my
personality -- the part of me that
tries to ease the tension here at
Davidson which we all experience
and sometimes gets a little out of
hand, but those of you who know
me well know also that I take my
commitments very seriously and
with the utmost pride.
The reason that I’m running
[for SGA president] is that I’d like

all come across as funat that point.

Secondly, I would like to add
that I feel like I am an approach-
able person, and I think the ap-
proachability of the SGA needs to
be increased. I feel that, at times,
it’s seen as an unreachable organi-
zation. People look to their sena-
tors, and they might like to voice
their opinions, their suggestions,

and their complaints, but they wind
up feeling like they’re being blown
off, or not taken seriously. They
don’t think the senators really sit
down and give them the chance to
explain how they feel about what
is going on. I think that the people
who know me on this campus will

I agree that all the candidates are very qualified,

office is that I seldom run out of energy.

to give back to Davidson the in-
valuable experience that it has
provided for me. - I’ve been in-
volved in various activities, and I
see this as a way to funnel my
energies and my enthusiasm. I
have served [the SGA] in various
capacities, whether itbe as Trustee
Liaison,committee chairman, class
president, or house senator.

More importantly, there are two
qualities I feel that I can bring to
the SGA: first, enthusiasm. I feel
that enthusiasm is the key to a
position of this sort. It’s not only
motivating for myself, but it’s
something which others can look
‘ toand thrive off of. I think thatmy
enthusiasm has helped me get
through alotof the activities we’ ve
done through the SGA. At three
o’clockin themoming when you're
spying on the policemen to im-

prove campus security, it doesn’t

agree that I do my best to make
people feel comfortable, and I’d
like to bring that human aspect,
that personable quality, to the stu-
dent body through the SGA.

I have served on athletic, reli-
gious, and service oriented: com-
mittees, and I feel that the SGA is
seen sometimes as an organization
which works exclusively, inde-
pendently of these committees. I
feel that all of those aspects are
equally important to life at
Davidson, whether it be the Catho-
lic Campus Activities group, play-
ing varsity Field Hockey, or work-
ing with the Adopt-a-Grandparent
program at The Pines. If we can
funnel activities of this sort into
the SGA, then they can be more
successful than when organizations
work independently of one another.

And so, tonight I stand before
you to ask for your support. I

won’t make any empty promises,
but I promise that I will put heart
and soul into the job. I think that
the election deserves fair consid-
eration, for the simple fact that it
affects each one of usat some time
during the year.”

Davidsonian: What do you think
your prime objective in office will
be?

Carberry: One area of concern is
that sometimes decisions are made,
take for instance the minus grades
Situation, and the students don’t
feel as if they were properly ad-
dressed. I feel that we should re-
ally be addressing the students,
hearing their feedback and bring-
ing it to the faculty by calling for
forums so that opinions can be
expressed.

I’m also working to get a public
policy committee kicking. I think
that the town of Davidson, and the
little school that we belong to here
is nice, but the world around us is
also very important. And I believe
that while it’s not the SGA’s job to
take a stand on issues, we can, at
least, provide a flow of informa-
tion to the student senators so that
they can pass it on to the student
body. Tripp Helms tried to do this
in regard to the Apartheid situation
when he was SGA president. I
think that with the gulf crisis we
could have senators get students
interested in writing the Marines. I

know we try to do that down at '

Rusk. Whether it be the blood or
bone marrow drives, our aware-
ness of the world around us is very
important.

The Division I versus Division
III conflict is another issue which 1
don’t think the SGA has really
jumped into. Maybe that means
we should have a poll of the stu-
dent body and give them a chance
to show us how they feel one way
or the other, so that we can in turn
offer the faculty and the trustees
their opinion.

Davidsonian: All three of the
presidential candidates havea great
deal of experience and show them-
selves to be qualified for the office.
What separates you from your
competition in this election?

Carberry: \ agree that all the can-
didates are very qualified, but one
unique quality which] can bring to
the office is that I seldom run outof
energy. And I feel that I can make
everyone else a little more enthusi-
astic about coming to meetings,
and make them feel as if they are
being productive.

I also want to get the commit-
tees going. I believe that we defi-
nitely have the ability to have this
campus running well, but a lot of
times the committees aren’t ever
checked up on. And I can give
them the drive to work more effi-
ciently, be it in regard to the ticket
policy, or whatever.

what" salso growing! is sthe role that
the senate will take. I believe that
Iam the most qualified to deal with
these three issues for reasons that I
would like to point out to you by
using the letters of my name.

C is for ‘creative’: I have been
on the SGA for three years now,
and in that time you reach points
where you get into ruts, and I have
been instrumental in coming up
with new issues and ideas for the

dent Conduct. aed

passable in my dedication, and |
feel that my performance makes
that clear.

E is for the ‘experience’: AL
though all three candidates do have
experience, my positions have been
very important within the senate.
Chancellor, especially, gave me an
inside look at what the administra-
tive workload is. Thank you.”

Davidsonian: You mentioned the
growth in the size of the campus.
How do you think the senate will
work with the Residence Life
Office regarding that issue?

Covington: We had worked with
the RLO in order to improve the
laundry facilities for the number of
people who are coming to the
campus, and also talking about
ideas to deal with the problem of
dorm space. I’ve been talking to
the administration, but nothing
concrete has come up yet. We
need tosce exactly how much we’re
going to increase next year, and
what the ratio of men to women
will be before we can make any
promises about housing.

As far as the diversity goes, I do
believe that the Solidarity Com-
mittee is very important-to the
campus. Although we have had
some activities on campus, they
have not been very well attended,
and I’d like to see thatchange. We
had a Martin Luther King celebra-
tion with a service and a 28 hour
ptayer vigil which only 15 or 20
students attended, even though it
was very well publicized. We also

in this regard.

senate.

A is for ‘articulate’: One of the
main jobs of the SGA president is
to communicate with the trustees
and with the administration of the
college. I have had a lot of experi-
ence with this because my trustee
contact is Mr. Wall, the Chairman

of the Board of Trustees, and I feel’

very capable of communicating
with them in an articulate way.

The first M is for ‘mindful’:
Although I know that I must work
with the administration and with
the trustees, towards everyone’s
best interests, I’m always mindful
of students’ needs and will take
them into consideration.

The next M is for ‘mixed’: I
havea very mixed group of friends,
I have been on the Solidarity
Committee which works to im-
prove relations between all people
on the campus, and I think I would
be approachable from all sides of
the campus.

1 is for ‘insurpassable’: I have
been on the SGA longer than any-
one in my class. I was a freshman
senator, I was the Chancellor my
sophomore year (an appointed
office wherein I worked closely
with the president as a secretary
and treasurer), and I am currently
Junior Class President. I feel insur-

sponsored a room in the Union at
Christmas time where children
from town could learn to say ‘Merry
Christmas’ in several different
languages.

We are having a Solidarity
Week in the spring, which I hope
will improve awareness and diver-
sity, and help us get away from
what William F. Buckley might
like about us.

Davidsonian: Whatare your ideas
about getting more students in-
volved with the activities of the
Solidarity Committee and the SGA
as a whole?

Covington: The Solidarity Com-
mittee is separate from the rest of
the senate, and I think itis a larger
issue of making the whole senate

moreaccessible to the student body.

I really want to make the senate a

very visible figure, and I believe

that that can be done through the
administration and by having more
events like the picnic scheduled
for next week in Johnston Gym for
