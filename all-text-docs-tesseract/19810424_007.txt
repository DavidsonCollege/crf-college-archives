Tennis teams
await tourneys

Men finish 22-5

By SCOTT BEAVER

The Davidson men’s tennis team
finished up its successful conference
season with a record of 22-5, the team’s
best since 1978. It was Coach Jeff
Frank’s third best finish in his eight-
year tenure at Davidson.

The Wildcats finished up 6-1 in the
Southern conference, losing only to
Furman. They had one more game to
complete against Appalachian State
yesterday before the tournament began,
since the Davidson-ASU match at Boone
was rained out with the score tied at 3-3.

“T’m really happy with our. record,’
Frank said. “It’s outstanding. I think
the individual records are super.”’ Frank
noted that the five top players had each
won 20 matches or more. ‘‘I think that’s
pretty incredible consistency.”

The Southern Conference tournament
began today. Frank predicted that
Furman and UT-Chattanooga would be
the strongest teams, however, he added,
“Our guys’ records are so good, and our
confidence is such that, on any given
day, we could come up winners.”’

Frank expects his seniors who have
led the team all season, to perform well
in the tournament. ‘‘I think would
expect Jay (Gepfert) to turn it loose.”
Frank also said junir Nevins Todd would
be a “‘tough competitor,’’ whose con-
ference record leads the team going into
the tournament.

No matter how the Wildcats fare in
the conference tournament, Frank has
been pleased with the performance of his
team this season. ‘‘We are really good
this year, maybe even a little bit better
than I thought we would be at the
beginning of the season. It was just a
tremendous year. Frank said.

The women’s tennis team finished the
regular season Tuesday with an out-
standing team record of 16-2. Junior
Emmy Knobloch, in the number one
singles position, remained undefeated in
18 matches.

On April 7 the Cats defeated Guilford
College 7-2. Last year Davidson and
Guilford had tied for second place in the
state tournament. Coach Pat Miller said
that this year’s match was ‘‘the best
match we played as a whole team.” Da-
vidson won all six singles matches.

The number-three doubles team, jun-
ior Adelaide Wilcox and sophomore
Catherine Smith lost for the first time at
the hands of Guilford. Despite their loss,
Wilcox and Smith still hold the team’s
best doubles record.

On April 13, the lady netters shut out
Pfeiffer College 9-0. April 14, the Cats
fell to Appalachian State University 3-6.
Knobloch was the sole singles winner
against Appalachian. Wins in the first
and third doubles position rounded out.
the score.

This week, the Cats finished the
season with two strong victories, defeat-
ing UNCC Monday and Presbyterian
College Tuesday. The score in both
matches was 6-3.

Yesterday the team left for Greens-
boro to compete in the North Carolina
Association for Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women (NCAIW) state tournament.
Miller said that undefeated High Point
College is the favored team, but David-
son and Guilford stand close behind in
the ratings.
