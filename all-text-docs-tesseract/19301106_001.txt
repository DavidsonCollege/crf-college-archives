WOFFORD TERRIERS BATTLE
WILDCATS HERE SATURDAY

Wofford Hits Stride Two Weeks
Ago by Holding Duke 14-0

ALWAYS GIVE FIGHT

Terriers Present Stellar Performer
in King, at Right Tackle

Wofford’s Terriers will invade Richard-
son field Saturday afternoon to tangle with
the Wildcats in another one of their tradi-
tional battles which ought to turn into a
hard fought match bfeore the evening is
over. Bringing practically the same line-up
which fought the ’Cats last, year down in
Spartanburg to hold them to one touch-
down, the Terriers are expected to put up
a stiff defense. The Terriers have under-
taken one of the stiffest schedules ever ar-
ranged for a Wofford team, including such
formidable foes as Clemson, William and
Mary, P. C., Duke, Auburn, and Furman.

Although Wofford has been successful in
only two out-of the past seven encounters, she
has proved herself to be anything but a set-
up, as shown in the hard-fought battle with
William and Mary and by holding Duke to
a 14-0 win. The Terriers specialize in up-
setting the dope bucket by either defeating
bigger teams or holding them to a compara-
tively low score.

After getting off to a flying start by
smothering Newberry under a 43-0 ava-
lanche, Clemson struck them before they
had hit their stride and trounced them, 32-0.
Wofford was something of a disappoint-
ment in the Clemson game, but according to
Coach Tommy Scaffe, Josh Cody had the
greatest team since coming to Clemson, so
he did not consider it such a disgrace to
be defeated by such a team.

Returning with renewed fight and a never-
say-die spirit, the Terriers bounced back into
the Panthers from High Point College to
the tune of 12-6, despite the stubborn fight
put up by High Point. Following this game,
Wofford journeyed to Virginia to give the
William and Mary team the fight of their
lives under the are lights. The line, it ig
said, slightly outplayed the Indian line and
if it had not been for long runs, William
and Mary might have been defeated.

By playing heads-up football, Presbyterian
College converted Wofford mistakes into a
victory the next week-end. In the first quar-
ter a Terriers punt was blocked and Cheat-
ham picked it up on the five-yard line and
scampered’ across for the first score. Then
in the second quarter a long pass and a 15-
yard run netted 50 yards and a touchdown.

Masquers Present
First Play on 15th

“The Red and Black Masquers,” David-
son’s dramatic club, has already begun active
work in preparation for what promises to
be a very successful season. A reorganiza-
tion of the club has taken place, which is
expected to make it a more serviceable or-
ganization, with a broader scope of activ-
ity. The requirements for membership have
been raised, and only those who have de-
cided talents in the different phases of dra-
-matics will be admitted. Thus a smaller and
more compact group will be formed, having
no idle members. In the past, with a large
membership, the club has not realized its full
possibiljties,

On November 15, “The Masquers” will
present as their first play, “The Perfect
Alibi,” written by A. A. Milne. Work on
one-act plays will be begun in the near fu-
ture. An extensive schedule has been made
for presentations which will be given both
here and in other places.

Professor E. J. Erwin is the faculty ad-
viser of the organization, and the following
men are officers: Stuart Meacham, presi-
dent; Johnny Marvin, secretary; Horace
Eryin, business manager. At the present
time the other members are: Harry Moffett.
Jim Black, Ed Hancock, Gaither Sandford,
J. W. McCutchan, Bill McKnight, John
Brown, and Duncan Calder.

Plans for Library
Improvements Made

It has been a srierapit tae fact for the past few |

years that the Davidson College library has |

been far too small for the size of the stu-

dent body. President Lingle and the library |

committee have also recognized this fact
and for the last few months have
trying to solve this difficult problem.

The problem was first announced to, the
public when last spring the Carnegie Cor-
poration of New York awarded to Davidson

been

College a sum of fifteen thousand dollars to |
be paid in three annual installments for the |
improvement of the college library. It was’
at this time that the problem became more |

acute for the library is now full to over-
flowing with the best of books, the books
of lesser importance having been culled out
at different times, so that now only the best
remain,

The new plan will make it necessary for
the library to have more book shelves, more
reading tables, and a better lighting system
than is now available. It must be remembered
that the Davidson library as it now stands
is approximately twenty-five years old and
was made for a student body of three hun-
dred rather than one of six hundred, al-
ready the shelves are crowded with books
In order to solve this plan the library com-

mittee thought it advisable to consult. some

one who really knew libraries; the Carnegie
institution recommended three men,
whom was Dr. Louis R. Wilson, librarian
the U. N. C. library. Dr. Wilson has

those who they think have distinguished
themselves in their respective lines of activ-
ity. A man is not restricted to the number
of honorary fraternities to which he may
belong.

Honorary fraternities exist on the campus

as an acknowledgement of achievement in}

Yow! To Appear Soon

“The Yowl,” Davidson's new humorous
magazine, after having suffered some little
jdelay, will appear within the next two or
| three weeks, according to W. C. Ragin, ed-
| itor.

All of the material has been handed in and
“made up, and will be sent to the publishers
by the end of the week. How long it will be
after that before it appears cannot be defi-
nitely estimated.

Any student wishing to have extra copies
sent off may obtain them at student rates
be seeing J. H. Henderlite, the business man-
jager of the magazine, by the end of this
week.

Some very good talent appeared when
the call was issued for tryouts, and the editor
expects to put out several of the best. is-
sues the college has seen in several years.

Some of the members of the editorial staff
are as follows: Crosswell Ragin, Jack Mat-
Vereen Bell, Allen Whitehead, Bill
