GIVES AUTOGRAPH ’
After winning the two-mile event at
the Charlotte Armory Monday night,

Earl Frazier, Davidson's scintillating dis-
tance runner, was solicited from all side’
by autograph seekers who insisted that
he give them his signature.

Earl was somewhat embarrassed
at first, but when he realized that
he had taken honors along with
such nationally known performers
as Jack Torrance and Harry Wil-
liamson, he very readily accommo-
dated his admirers by affixing his
“John Hancock,” on every piece

_.of paper put before him. I believe

he even signed one or two for

some Davidson boys.

John Lee and Frazier did themselves
and Davidson proudly in this first of
Charlotte’s indoor track meets. David-
son was the smallest school represented
and it came home with two of the events
from a small. field.

A. J. Potter and Audley Gam-

~ mon deserve credit along with Lee

and Frazier. Potter came third to
Jack Torrance, gigantic L. S. U.
shot-putter, who shattered the
world indoor record in the Char-
lotte show, and Gammon cleared
the bar at 5 feet seven and one-
half inches to tie for third place
in the high jump.

This clears away some of the gloom
that has hovered over the Wildcat
coaches since they began to work with
their track prospects early in the year.
News also comes that Fred McPhail will
be ready for action by the first spring
meet, so the Wildcats should show their
opponents plenty of heel before the sea-
son closes,

MATMEN COP

The Wildcat grapplers took the
big five mat title from N. C. State
Friday night with one of the hard-
fought tch
tor ever witnessed. Every man on
both teams was giving all he had.
Three of the duels ended as draws,
State got two time advantages as
did Davidson, and Lawrence Quar-
terman came through to win the
only fall of the evening and bring
Davidson the match and the big-
five conference championship.
Barnhardt, the man Quarterman pinned,

was being watched by his parents, who
had come all the way from Massachu-
setts to see their son compete in the
titular fray. Too bad he had to lose not
simply the deciding match but also the
only fall that either team scored,
CHEERFUL HAPPENINGS

Felix has had a great deal to
cheer him lately. He became ter-

“ribly sad after his old friend

“Doc” Charlie died, but the cards

have fallen right for the Felines

during the past, week and nothing
pleases the mascot more than to
see his lads bring home the bacon.

The basketeers, both varsity and fresh-
men, ended their seasons with significant
and decisive wins, and this’ along with
encouraging, reports from the mat and
track puts an enormous smile on David-
son’s face.

Spring football shouldn’t be left
out in our optimistic browsings.
The reds and greys had another
nip and tuck scrimmage Saturday
afternoon, and it was particularly
heartening to watch the progress
of the freshmen candidates now
vieing for places on the 1935
eleven.

The interesting part of all this glori-
ous news is that it brightens the future
for ‘Wildcat aggregations,

Cage hopes are made bright by
a group of fast stepping Sopho-
mores, who will remain to carry
on for two more seasons, being
strengthened next winter by the

dvent of some promising yearling
material.

The-tracksters, of course, have a re-
newed outlook for the ensuing schedule,
and the footballers anticipate the most
powerful Wildéat—outfit—in several. au-
tumns.

TWO WILDCATS
VICTORIOUS IN
JAY-GEE MEET

Earl Frazier And John Lee Take
Two Mile And Pole Vault
With Ease

TORRANCE SETS MARK

Other Davidson Men Win Places
In Various Events

Earl Frazier and John Lee, two junior
members of Davidson's track team, took
two first places out of a possible ten in
the Jay Cee Indoor Track Meet held in
the Charlotte Armory Monday night.

The meet, which was an invitational
affair, featured the breaking of the
world’s indoor shot put record by Jack
Torrance of L. S. U. with a heave of
fifty-three and a half feet, to exceed the
previous record by four and three-fourths
inches.

Frazier ran the two-mile event in beau-
tiful form, starting out leisurely and
gradually pulling up among his competi-
tors until by the half he was well ahead.
Toward the end of the race, he was
slightly pushed the famous Dick
Dunaj of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. However, Frazier had too much
of a lead over him and crossed the line

by

with Dunaj eight yards behind in sec-
ond place.

Lee, while the races were in progress,
won the pole vault with the exception-
ally good height of 12 feet, 2 inches,
to take first place in that event. He was
followed by Bear of Carolina and Smith
of Carolina, who took second and third,
respectively.

A. J. Potter taking third
place in the shot put, in which Torrance
set a new record, and Audley Gammon

Potter's heave was for a distance of 37
feet, 814 inches, while Gammon _ took
wings to sail 5 feet. 7% inches in the
high jump event.

MORGAN LEADS

We are just in receipt of some last-
minute dope on the Wildcat loopsters.
The statistics through the Wake Forest
game Monday night showed Jim Morgan
out front in the individual scoring hon-
ors by 45 points. Jim chalked up a to-
tal of 189 points while Charlie Harris
and Courtney Ross are second and third
in the order named, with 144 and 140

’Cats End Fourth Week Of

Grinding Football Practice

Lafferty Runs Seventy-Six Yards
To Score Touchdown In
Practice Game

The Davidson Wildcats ended their
fourth week of spring football Satur-
day afternoon when the Grey eleven de-
feated the Red team 6 to 2 on Richard-
son Field. A 76-yard run by “Teeny”
Lafferty featured the game.

Four coming sophomore backs, Hogan,
Dennis, Harrison, and Lafferty, showed
plenty of promise. Harrison and Dennis
tore the line time and again for gains,
while Hogan's passing and punting were
superb. Jim Jolinston, guard, played a
jam-up game for the Reds, while Hunter
McClung and Dick Johnson stood out
for the Greys in the line.

The only touchdown of the afternoon
was tallied by Lafferty when he faked
a punt and went off-tackle for 76 yards
and a score. Hunter aided with a bit
of perfect interference. Jim Johnston
scored the safety for the losers when he
covered Paul Pittman’s first blocked punt.

This game completed the fourth week
of spring football and leaves the ’Cats
with two more weeks under the tutelage
of Coaches Newton and McEver.

Juniors Top F. reshmen
In Intramural Soccer

Last Friday afternoon the freshmen
met the juniors on the soccer field, and
the upper classmen showed their suprem-
acy by taking the victory, 2-1. Out-
standing among the members of the win-
ning team were Bell and Hake, while
the frosh squad followed Cothran and
McClanahan. Faison scored the fresh-
man goal.

There remains but one game to be
played in the current intramural soccer
season. The juniors will meet the soph-
omores.

The last game of the current intra-
mural soccer season was played this aft-
ernoon between the juniors and the soph-
omores, in order to break the tie be-
tween these two teams, and determine a
championship class. The score of this
game was, of course, not available when
The Davidsonian went to press.

In its first season on the campus soc-
cer has gained a good foothold here, and
future seasons should be even more suc-
cessful.

Sig’s | Basketball

Sig Eps Take Interfraternity
Crown By 17-16

Last Tuesday night the S. P. E.’s nosed
out the Kappa Sigs [7-16 for the inter-
fraternity basketball championship. These
two evenly-matched teams put on an ex-
hibition of good basketball throughout
and it remained for Charlie Yeager’s
long goal at the finish to decide the is-
sue.

Soon after the start of the second
half the S. P. E.’s brought the score into
a deadlock and from that’ point it was
a nip and tuck affair until the end. With
the score 15-16 in favor of the Kappa
Sigs, Yeager sank a long one, the ball
being in the air when the final whistle
blew, for the two points necessary for
victory.

‘Wingfield and Ravenel were outstand-
ing for the losers. The play of Yeager,
Jenkins and McCall was best for the
victors.

An enthusiastic crowd witnessed this
clash which practically cinched the fra-
ternity athletic trophy for the Kappa
Sigs.

Tryouts: Teld Tuesday
For Varsity Golf Team

Davidson’s varsity golf team began the
new season with tryouts which were held
‘Tuesday, February 26.

Those men ttying out were: Charlie
Hamrick, Bill Show, George Cowan,
Ralph McClelland, Ab Price, and Charlie
Ross. Charlie Hamrick is the only let-
ter man returning. It was not known at
the time of publication what the results
of the tryouts were.

The schedule for the season is:

WILDCATS DOWN DEACONS
IN LAST BIG FIVE CONTEST

AITTENS DEFEAT
ABBEY QUINTET

Wildkittens Defeat Junior College
Champions During Last
Few Seconds

After a nip and tuck battle which
gave no assurance of victory to either
side until the last few seconds of play,
the Wildkitten basketeers put on a final
scoring spurt in the last two minutes of
the game to defeat Belmont Abbey, North
Carolina junior college basketball cham-
pions, by a score of 24-18,

Belmont Abbey administered a good
licking to the freshman team earlier in
the season, and last Monday night in the
preliminary to the final varsity game with
Wake Forest the ’Kittens were out for
revenge. The Abbey aggregation was
a hard opponent to subdue, however, and
neither team got more than two points
ahead of the other until the game was
almost over. The half ended with the
score tied 9-9,

With only two minutes to play, David-
son was trailing by a margin of one
point. Led by Kiesewetter and Rhine-
hardt, they rang up three field goals in
quick succession to cinch the victory. A
foul shot after the game was over added
an additional point,

Keisewetter and Rhinehardt led the
scoring with eight points each. They
were followed by Capt. Wade Barrow
with five points. Waltz was high scorer
for the visitors with a total of six points
to his credit.

The final week of the season has been
a busy one for the freshman team; On
Monday, February 18, they were defeat-
ed by the Duke freshmen in the David-
son gym by the score of 34-20. Lewis
and Edwards of Duke managed to run
up one of the highest scores which has
been made against the ’Kittens this year.
Keisewetter starred for Davidson.

On Tuesday night at Concord the
freshmen swamped Concord High School
by the odds of 46-19, Keisewetter again
was the leading scorer with fourteen
points. On Thursday night they scored
another victory over a strong opponent

lina Teachers College by the margin of
33-27. E. C. T. C. has one of the Strong
teams of the state.

In a game with Charlotte High School
in Charlotte last week the 'Kittens. lost
a very close game, 31-27. The Belmont
Abbey victory brought the season record
up to eight wins and nine Josses, most
of the losses toward the beginning of
the season, and most of the wins toward
its close.

Davidson Pulls Out At Last
Minute To Leave Wake
Forest In Cellar

TERRORS BOW TO ’CATS

Local Quintet Badly Upsets Dope
By Last Week’s Trip

The Davidson Wildcat quint pulled
itself out of the Big Five cellar last
Monday night when it defeated Wake
Forest’s Demons by a 31-24 count on
the local floor.

After giving Wildcat supporters many
anxious moments when they were left
behind by Wake Forest last week, the
’Cats came back and defeated two Big
Five opponents to put themselves a notch
above the Deacons.

The game Monday was Davidson’s last
Big Five basketball game of the season.
They closed their 1935 season last night
in a game with Erskine.

In a slow game, characterized by many
fouls on both sides, the ’Cats faced their
rivals for the cellar post, during the
first half. Failure of the plays of either
side to click resulted in a 13-13 tie at
the half.

Davidson came back after the half
much improved, and picked up a lead
early in the playing, which they held to
the end, despite a last-minute spurt of
the Deac’s.

Bill Quick of Davidsot, Patton,
Hatcher, and Morris of Wake Forest,
left the game on fouls. Big Jim Mor-
gan led the scoring with a total of 13,
followed by Clark of Wake Forest with
seven: points.

Last week’s playing showed an amaz-
ing disregard for predictions. The Wild-
cat quint upset the dope bucket twice,
dropping a predicted win over Wake For-
est Thursday, and unexpectedly trounc-
ing the much-lauded State quint the fol-
lowing night.

Leaving here Thursday morning, the
’Cats faced their rivals for cellar post
at Wake Forest that night. Morris, star
of the Deacons, was high scorer for the
game with 10 points, closely. pursued by
Big Jim Morgan, Davidson, with nine.

The ’Cats led by two points at the
half, but the Deacons squeezed out a
one-point victory in the last few minutes,
