Still Weaving Through Kenya

By Weave Whitehead

Two weeks ago, I wrote an ar-
ticle describing my semester in
Kenya. This, week, Iam going to
tell about my sec-
ond experience in
Kenya. Incase you
~~ missed last week I
will give some
background. From
January until May,
I attended the
School for Field
Studies’ Center for
Wildlife Manage-
ment. Located on
agame ranch inthe
savanna of south-
ern: Kenya, the
school provides an
excellent opportu-
nity to study Afri-
can wildlife. The
course included
three classes anda
research projectas |
well as three safa-
ris. I had a most
enjoyable time as
a Student and I re-
tured to Kenya
last summer as an
intern for the
School for Field
Studies. As I said
inthe lastarticle,I
am not able to
choose which ex-
perience was “bet-
ter”, for they were quite different.

As a student, all of my energies
were concentrated on learning
about Africa and wildlife manage-
ment. As staff, though, my goal
was to make sure that the summer
students had as much fun and
learned as much as I did. The
summer courses are only one month
long so the instruction is not as in
depth but the material (i.e. animal,
bird, and plant names) must be
picked up more quickly, My jobs
as an intern ranged from alarm
clock to assistant teaching to sup-
ply procurement to chauffeur.
When I awokeeach morning, I had
no idea what the day had in store
for me.

During the mornings, the stu-
dents conducted theirresearch. The
interns were called on to drive the
research teams to their study sites
and to assist with animal identifi-
cation and research techniques. As
astudent, I spentall of my research
time looking at birds. Research
time as an intern was different ev-
ery day. One moming I would
drive the “giraffe group” to mea-
sure the feeding heights of giraffe
while thenext day I mightbe build-
ing a trap to catch Yellow-necked
Spurfowl (a game bird about the
size of achicken). Because I hada
hand in every research project;my
knowledge of African wildlifecon-
tinued to grow.

Another important part of my
job was “trips into town”. This
may sound trivial, but when I left
for Nairobi to buy supplies,1 won-

dered if I would ever return. My ©

fears stemmed from the condition
of the school’s Land Rovers and
the quality of Kenyan driving. The
school has use of six Land Rovers
and Land Cruisers, at any given
time, though, only four or five

would be working. These trucks
ate parts and drank oil insatiably

(while on a safari scouting trip, I
’ put three gallons of oil in a car in

Giraffes i in te

one day). If the car did not break”

down, there was always the possi-
bility of an accident. A near head-
oncollision or two was notuncom-
mon on a trip to Nairobi. In town,
cars pack the streets and aggres-
sive, “offensive” driving was the
only way to get around:

Through my dealings with
Nairobi merchants and officials in
the National Parks, I realized the
corrupt nature of Kenyan business
and government. Any price is ne-
gotiable and bribes to police and
other government officials arecom-
monplace. My white skin and

American money ‘gave me much

clout when making purchases but
police officers targeted me and, on
more than one occasion, fabricated
charges hoping I would offer a
bribe. At first, I was
aghast at the wide-
spread corruption,
but I soon. realized
that it was just part
of the system that I
would learn to work
with.

During the sum-
mer I was able to
participate in some
ranch activities that
I would not have
been able to witness
as a student. Taking
part in the capture of
a giraffe for blood
sampling was one of
the most memorable.
The ranch periodi-
cally samples blood
from its giraffes in
order to check for
diseases that may
have infected the
population. On this
occasion, the subject
was a fourteen year
old male which
stood about fifteen
feet tall. The giraffe
was ‘darted from a
Land Rover about
three-hundred yards
away. A drugged
animal is very unpredictable for it
loses its sense of direction and its
vision becomescloudy. We moved
in quickly to try to prevent it from
entangling itself in a fence or fall-

- ing too hard. The research team

attempted to trip the giraffe by
wrapping a rope around its legs,
the powerful animal broke the rope,
though, and raced toward our Land
Rover. Luckily, it fell before it
reached us. When a giraffeis down,
the head must be. raised and tem-
perature regulation must begin im-
mediately. When we reached the
giraffe, we found thatit had broken
the dart off inside itself during the

Davidson Elementary Tutoring: ;

Davidson Elementary Tutoring has started the year with a bang!
Each day Monday through Thursday from 3 to 5 p.m:, Davidson
‘students head to the Ada Jenkins Center to tutor and build friendships—
with children from Davidson Elementary School. Tutoring makes a
big difference in the lives of these children, many of whom need ext
help and attention.

_ Davidson students have also gone to the Center to play their
miisical instriments and talk about music to the childrén, The BSC
held a welcome-back party for the children too. The kids love to
interact with college students.

The co-chairpersons of Davidson Elementary Tutoring have ne
started a project to improve the dental hygiene of the kids. A dentist
donated some toothbrushes, and every day after snack, the children
have fun brushing their teeth together. ~

While the program is going great, more tutors are enected. If you
want to do some fun and rewarding volunteer work, please contact
Lindsay Shoemaker (-6646), Treloar Tredennick a 1), or Vernelle
Trim (-6286).

Every Tuesday from 4 to 5 p.m. and 6to7 p.m. and Thursday from
6 to 7 p.m., Davidson tutors drive into Charlotte to tutor elementary-
Se children from different ethnic backgrounds, who live in low

ome housing. This tutoring is especially needed, due to Janguage
barriers that these children face.

The tutors help the children with their homework and read with
them each time. Davidson students are also invited to share a meal
with the children at the church, but are asked to pay $1.

The time commitment is small, but the rewards are great. This
new Reach Out program needs lots of volunteers to help make a

difference in these children’s lives.’ Please call Mary-Gwyn Sansom

Lor uila Roos (-6637), if interested.

Rides to Charlotte are provided. }

with a drugged giraffe. Sparing

unsuccessful. This ill-fated proce-

Other activities such as observ-

School for Field Studies allowed
me to reinforce and further my
knowledge of Africa and wildlife
management. Through my in-
volvement in the logistical aspects
of the program, I gained a greater
understanding of Kenya’s eco-
nomic, political and cultural sys-
tems. Once again, if anyone has
any questions about East Africa or
the School for Field Studies (or
just wants to hear me ramble more),
don’t hesitate to call me.
