Much Better Work Shown in

Students Manifest Real Interest—
Best Program of the Year

The Eumencan Society held its usual
meeting Saturday night. ‘The subject
of the debate was: Resolved, “That the’
United States Should Actively Intervene
in Mexico.” ‘The affirmative side of
this question was upheld by J. C. Bailey, |
\J. P. Price and R. Bitze~ Bailey, in-;
a well-prepared speech, vividly pictured |
the conditions in Mexico, and said these
conditions justified intervention. Price |
advanced the argument that ours would,
‘be an altruistic intervention and so
would succeed. Bitzer said that by in-:
tervention we can do good, and should
therefore intervene.

A. D. King, first speaker for the neg-
ative, claimed that intervention would
hurt the United States and would not
properly meet the situation. P. B. Car-
wile contended that conditions in Mex-
ico are not so bad as prejudiced rumor
(ould indicate, and are constantly im-
proving. B. H. Boyd closed the debate
with the contention that the situation
will best be met by an educational in-
tervention which will not antagonize
the people.

The judges decided in favor of the

affirmative,
‘ W. B. Sullivan, reviewer, eulogized
the debate as a whole and critcised Boyd
for a lack of co-ordination, using for
this purpose a joke rock-ribbed and an-
cient as the granite hills of his native
State, Georgia.

J. M. Richards ably delivered as a
declamation Dr. Giradeaw’ oration on
the occasion of the reinterment of the
South Carolina soldiers who fell at
Gettysburg.

McGirt, also from Georgia, pulled
on the reviewer a joke also “rock-
ribbed, etc.”

The executive committee reported
that, by agreement with the Philan-
thropic Society, the Junior-Senior Inter-
Society Debate would be held during
the fall term this year instead of in the
spring, as has formerly been customary.
{| In spite of rather bad order, the

@(strength and conviction to every loyal

fect style and complete knowledge of
the subject as Zane Grey.. How many
of us have stayed up at night to read
such rattling good stories as the “Riders
of the Purple Sage” and the “Border
Legion” and have gone to bed only to
dream of the “Lone Star Ranger?”
Zane Grey gives us the true story of
our West in a gripping and open-heart-
ed manner so that one could well be-

. lieve the events taking place before his

eyes.

_ At the beginning of the world’s war,
the great Northwestern wheat sections
were owned by men who in many ways
‘were of pro-German sympathy, ‘I‘hen
Germany money was used by the I, W.
W. to destroy the crops, for at that time
wheat meant the success of our armies in
the field. ‘I'he horrible deeds of de-
struction of the I. W. W., instead of
guining pro-German disciples, causes
the men of the Northwest to realize
their true government.

There is a charming love story run-
ning through the book. ‘The characters
are strong-minded Westerners who im-
press the reader by their spirit in the
war,

Zane Grey teaches the true lesson of
Americanism. Such a book should add

DAVIDSON MEN ‘FRYING FOR
RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS.

The Cecil Rhodes scholarship to Ox-
ford University is of great interest to
many people at this time of che year.

There will be given scholarships to
one man from North Carolina, one
from South Carolina, one from Vir-
ginia, one from Mississippi, two from
Florida and two from Georgia. Two
men are permitted to apply from David-
son College.

These men who are given the schol-
arships enter Oxford, some in January
and some in October of 1920. The old
form of standing examinations has been
done away with and a committee com-
posed of former Oxford men has been
appointed to decide the scholarships.
The four following points are to deter-
mine who shall go:

1. Character; 2. Scholarship; 3. In-
terest in outdcor sports; 4. Ability for
leadership.

The men who have been recommend-
ed by the faculty as eligible for this
scholarship are as follows:

S. H. Askew and W. H. Harrell,
Georgia; J. R. McKeldin, Tennessee;
T. R. Boulware, Florida; L. B. Schenck,
North Carolina; L. P. Good, South
Carolina; A. P. Ormand, Mississippi,
and J. E. Cassell, Virginia. ,

The time for application closed on
October 5 1919.

“When the winds are out and the
storms are raging, there is plenty of
fear, but not a bit of danger. We may
be much tossed, but we are quite safe,
for we have an anchor of the soul both
sure and steadfast, which will not start.
—Spurgeon.

BLUE PENCIL CLUB FORMU-
LATES YEAR'S PLANS,

The Blue Pencil Club, at its regular
meeting last week, discussd the plans
for their literary work this year. ‘The
following plan was agreed upon: Each
member was given the name of a book
by some present-day writer to read and
study. This must be completed before
the Christmas holidays.

The discussions for the program of
every second meeting will be held by
one of the members, in which he will
take up and discuss the book that was
assigned him. The program of the al-
ternate meeting will consist of a gen-
eral discussion of current magazines and
periodicals, *

Each member is very enthusiastic over
the work and it is assiired that it will
be both interesting and instructive. The
initiation of new members will take
place at the next regular meeting.

O, YOU WONDERFUL WAL-
LACE, YOU’RE THE MAN
FOR US.

Again September 26th movies cafe
up to the desired standard in the presen-
tation by Wallace Reid of “Rimrock
Jones,” which is one of his most famous
pictures. lt was one of the best pictures
that has been shown to date in the
“Y." There was a little difficulty in
getting the show started, but when it
did start it couldn't be beat for smooth-
ness, and rapidity in changing the dif-
ferent par:s.

Between the third and fourth parts
“Bob” Miles, our secretary and friend,
came racing in almest out of breath to
announce that the score as learned from
the Charlotte Observer was 21-0 in our
favor, After the applause had finally
quieted slightly a motion was made to
the effect that a parade be formed im-
mediately after adjournment. So that
when we had seen Rimrock and his co-
partner finish their midnight interview,

by common consent the show became a] Douglass, Professor Wood and Profes-

parade.

Let’s all turn out next Friday and
celebrate Davidson’s third victory, and
while the pep is up, give fifteen for the
operators.

dinary occurrence as beating Wake For-
est,

Dr. Arbuckle eulogized our coach
and endcd with a chemical (T. N. T.)
joke.

Mr. Jackson declared that Wake
Forest was only a “sandwich” for Da-
vidson.

The crowd gave “fifteen” for Jack
Black. the half that knows no equal,
and the peppiert parade of many years
passed into history with song and jest-
ing. The nymph got here if the annuals
didn't.

And then came the Nymph and
brought with her much mirth, so that
the students deported themselves in the
most amazing fashion. Briefly, friend,
there was a “shirt-tail.”” Wake Forest,
having been aroused and hewn down on
her own camping grounds in spite of
her secret practice, etc., it was decided
by a 428 (17 men went on the trip) to
© vote to take a night off and celebrate.

The upper-classmen formed and the
Fresh were formed in front of Rumple
and the merry mob moved on. Dr.
Martin was visited first. He spoke for
every Davidson man. when he said he
wanted “Po make Bill Fetzer sick of
his job.”

The procession, led and well led by
N. C. Red Smith, shifted itself to Dr.
McConnell’s, where two speeches we
“had.” Dr. Lingle, the first orator, said
that the Wake Forest team must have
been looking on at the game. Dr. Mc-
Connell declared that the faculty had to
make too many speeches here during the
football season.

Colonel McConnell declared that
beating Wake Forest was a poor subject
for speech-making, but nevertheless he
certainly made a “hit.”

Professor Reid asked the man with
the big feet te please stand off the grass
and met with 425 responses.

Professor Currie, after requesting
someone to “Hold that bull yearling
with the bell” (Liston), got off a snap-
ping good speech.

Dr. Harding sympathized with the
boys in having to listen to so many
speeches on ene night.

Dr. Grey was not at home. The
same thing occurred in the case of Col-
onel Mueller, Dr. Richards, Dr. John

WAGES TO WIVES.

Whether we agree or not on the sub-
ject of wages for wives, yet every single
one of us will laugh at the simple,
humorous philosephy of ‘“Mirandy,”
written by Dorothy Dix in the Good
Housekeeping.

“Sis Mirandy, ma’am,” says Sis Ale-
thia to me de odder day, “how do you
hold wid dem whut is promulgatin’ dis

{| heah newfangled doctrine dat wives had
ought to be paid wages by deir hus-
bands?”

“Whut’s de matter wid de old-fash-
ioned plan bf a wife takin’ all of her
husband’s pay envelop instid of des git-
tin’ a rake-off?" T axes her. ‘Dat’s
de way our mothers done an’ de way
we dees, an’ so fur as I kin see, hit wuks
out all right. Anyway, I ain’t noticed
dat none of de married men dat 1 knows
is settin’ up automobiles or wearin’
diamonds on de money deir wives leaves
‘em to spend on deirselves.”

“But de Good Book says dat de la-
borer is werthy of his hire,” says Sis
Alethia, “an’ hit sho’ does seem dat ef
anvbody earns deir board an’ keep,
an’ a few plunks besides, hit’s de wife
an’ mother Whut wuks ‘bout eighteert
hours a day an’ den sleeps wid one eye
open watchin’ to see dat de chillun don’t
git unkivered, an’ wid her ear hung out
for de alarm clock so dat she can git up
an’ git breakfast most ready befo’ she
wakes up her husband.”
