This world of wimps needs
courses in survival like those of
fered in the universities in the
western staces. We can't canoe
down the Colorado River. Nor
can we climb Mt. Whitney.
Davidson, though, has it’s own

peculiar set of natural ob-
stacles.
Have you ever wondered

what the tower on the baseball
field is for? It is for an in-
troductory course in survival.
For the firstsemester’s work you
must climb the tower, with or

of beer in their urine.

After a thorough search of
Terry's office and home, in-
vestigators were able to piece
together Terry's plans for his
future operations.

Terry had master-minded a
plan for toally controlling
Davidson's athletic program.
Early basketball scores have
indicated that Terry may have
already influenced this area as
the Wildcat basketball team has
repeatedly run up big leads
before shaving the scores down
to the pre-game point spread.

In one case Terry was crossed
up when Lowry sank two free
throws that gave the wildcats a
20 pt. win instead of an 18 point
win over East Carolina. Since
then Lowry has yet to appear in
another game, and fear for his
life has been said to have driven
him to New Zealand.

This incident led the agent's
to draw up a warrant for
basketball coaches Terry
Holland and Bo Brickels, who
both had been earlier
questioned due to their in-
volvement in the 3-on-3 tourney.

Interesting to note is the
athletic department's similar
inability to discover the scandal
in their own midst. Athletic
director Tom Scott, when asked
to comment on the situation,
said that he knew nothing.
