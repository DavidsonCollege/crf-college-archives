For Is It Better Business
To Receive Than Give?

On the first Christmas was born the per-
sonification of the teaching, ‘*For it is more
blessed to give than to receive.”’ The wise

men came that night—not to receive
thing, but rather bearing wifts.

No one knows when the first celebration
of Christ’s birthday was held. but it is logical
to assume that the Christmas was
established as a time of concentrated prepa-
gatien of the Christian ideals and sincere re-

any-

season

dedication to them, in memory of. their
founder, And that is what it yet means to
the saddened oldsters among us. but how
about our veneration? Fi

The accounts of two Christmases, sepa-
rated by two thousand years, follow, The
first was recorded by a pair of reporters

named Luke and Matthew, with a date line
of Bethlehem, Judea, The second could be
written by any local reporter with a dateline
of Charlotte, Nort] Carolina,

1.) *‘And she brought forth her first born
son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes,
and laid him in a manger: for there was no
no room for them in the inn... And it eame
to pass as the angels were gone away from
them into heaven, the shepherds said one to
another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem
and see this thing which come to pass.
which the Lord hath made known to ns. And
they came with haste, and found Mary and
Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger ;
And the sheperds returned, glorifying and
praising God for all the things that they had
heard and seen, as it was told unto them.’

“Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem
of Judea in the days of Herod the king, be-

hold, there came wise men from the east to
Jerusalem. saying, Where is he that is born
king of the Jews? For we have seen his star
in the east, and are come to worship him. . .
And when they were come into the house,
they saw the young child with Mary his
mother, and fell down, and worshipped him ;
and when they had opened their treasures,

they presented unto him gifts: gold, and
frankincense, and myrrh.’
2.) Hundreds of thousands of people

thronged the streets of Charlotte on this gala
November opening of the Christmas season.
A touching spirit of benevolence was in evi-
dence everywhere, as beaming merchants
vyed the affltent throng, and happily
hummed snatches from that grand old Christ-
mas song, “Jingle Silver.”’

Glamorous young ‘queens?’ from pros
pective-customer towns added beauty and ap-
peal to the **Buy-from-me”’ floats that pa-
raded by unceasingly,

The star of the parade, following in an
high throne was the King of Christmas bimn-
Santa Claus, clad in all his splendor:
Many arose as he passed and they
made room for him through the throngs.

What think ye of these things which have’
vome to pass?

Fellowship

Davidson is proud that she builds char-
acter and leaders. In fact that is one of the
best advertisements of Davidson. This fact is
frequently extolled until one might get the
idea that everyone at Davidson. is a leader.
Fortunately, this is not the case.

Several years ago Ahe Reader's Digest
carried a yery interesting but short space
filler, the gist of which T would like to repeat
here, though the figures may not be exact.
It seems that a loving father hdd*written to a
well-Enown northern girl’s school attempting
to get his daughter entered there. In reply
they sent him a questionnaire to be filled in
and réfurned, In the questionnaire was the
question, “‘Is your daughter a leader?’
Slightly chargrined because his daughter was
not @ leader, he filled in the blank with ‘‘No,’’
but added in the margin as an after thought,
‘Sheas, however, an excellent follower,’ then
sent the questionnaire back to the college. In
a very few days the father received an answr
Which read something like this:

“Dear sir: In view of the fact that out
of 200 applications to our next year’s fresh-

self,

cheers

man Class, your daughter seems to be the
only ‘follower.’ we shall be glad to except
her, ete.”’

Of course, the tale is probably exag-
gerated, but it does bring out a salient point,
Le, the values and necessity of fellowship
should be more sreatly stressed. In as much
as everyone just can’t be a leader it would
seem that fellowship is gertainly just as im-
portant, if not more so,

The argument of this editorial is not that
we should cease to emphasize leadership, but
that the value of fellowship should be equally
stressed. In this present day it is hard to find
enough people who are willing to follow, That

nay be one of the reasons why there are so
many different ideologies floating around
without a following,

To be a Booe follower demands a good bit
of Lage nee and diserimination. A foHower
must be able to make a definite choice about
his beliefs and also. must know why he
chooses the views that he does.

Finally it seems that the best leaders are
those who are also the best followers, Any-
way you look at it the virtues of being a fol-
lower are greatly belittled and overlooked but
nevertheless important. Since not all people
