There are three leagues of eight
teams each, with round-robin
play slated within the leagues.

The top four teams in each
league qualify for the tourna-
ment, as in basketball.

Watts I! captured the basket-
ball crown, edging Delt t1 50-49
in the championship game, as
Juan Sanchez tallied 18 points
and Mark Rodgman added 15.

Watts II finished with an 11-1
mark overall, edging out Por-

Spectively, as the losers wound

Betas. The victors overcame a
four-point deficit in the final
minute. iy

Jack Willits’ 19 points was
high for the losers who ended
9-2 and tied with Delt I for

ately, everyone was blessing the
hellish Davidson campus.

A pervading uneasiness was
expressed in words of the four-
letter variety. It wasn’t until
that night that the uncertainty
was broken.

“Men, tomorrow morning we'll
get up at 6:15. We'll get our
testing done early so we can
practice the rest of the day.

“AU you'll be expecied to do
is just one 440. That’s just one
time around the track as hard
as you can run. Just pump those
arms and sprint around the
track.

“Then go down into the gym.
Lift as much weight as you can.
I'm talking about getting under
that bar and being ready and
just EXPLODE into that weight.
Just bench press as much as
vou can.

“Then go into the mat room.
Get with one of the coaches and
do your '50-poosh, 50-pike.’ That
is all men. See you tomorrow
morning.”

That was Coach Dave Fagg.
and, ‘‘poosh"’ means push up
and ‘pike’ means wearing your
butt thin, and 6:15 in the morn-
ing means dawn.

We lost our uncettainty that
night, but we gained the know|-
edge that Coach Fagg was his
good ol’ self.

One of the misfortunes, or
joys depending on how you look

third.

F&M, Emanon and Keeter’s
tied for fifth place with 8-2 rec-
ords, followed by Delt IT (10-3),

SAE (8-3) and ATO (7-3) in
tenth.
The Buzz Tarver-led SPEs

beat F&M 2-1 in the handball
finals, as the winners wound up
9-1. F&M also finished 9-1, with
PAX 1 (7-2) in third and the
Delts (6-3) fourth.

Five new teams are compet-
ing in volleyball: Bigs, X, Lit-
tle 2, Our Boys Gang and a
faculty team. Only four fresh-
men teams are entered.

at it, of the non-football players
at Davidson is not experiencing
Dave Fagg.

He is the most human man
(not humane, human) at David-
son College. I do not mean to
say he is Erasmus reborn. He is
Everyman.

He possesses almost all of
man’s attributes. Maybe that’s
why I can't figure him out.

He possesses some singularly
unique and puzzling qualities.
He's one of the few men who
can jump rope, without a rope.
At Camp Carolina we were
jumping rope for conditioning.
There weicn't enough ropes to
go around, Coach Fagg had to
do without.

That was okay, he was in the
back of the room doing double-
overs, pepper and other tricks,
but no rope.

He taught us the best) arm
movement to use in running.
The basic tent was to sort of
“seratch your sides with your
clbows.”

Some of us didn’t quite under
stand; so we used to watch oc-
casionally as the coach deter-
nunedly thrusted his elbows
while walking at a three mp!
clip around the practice field

The thing that puzzles me
most happened during my soph
omore year.

The scene was the upper prac
tice field. I was on defense
then.

The first team was scrim
maging the freshmen while I
admiringly looked on. It was a
cold day and it looked like
snow. I tried to keep) warm
while I stood securely on the
sidelines.

Coach Fagg walked up be
hind me so | tried to look at-
tentive. He was chewing a good
wad of tobacco.

“Bruce,” said Coach Fagg.
“Have you ever seen it snow?”

I had never heard a question
like that on the practice field
before. I didn’t even get a warn-
ing. Caught off guard I respond-
ed accordingly.

“Huh?”

“Becker. Have you ever secn
it snow?’

“Sure, coach. I used to live
in Philadelphia .. .”

“C'mon,” he argued.

“Sure I have, coach.

‘You’ve never seen it ‘snow.
You lived in Puerto Rico.”

‘Coach,” I replied, ‘I live in
California now, and they have
snow om the mountains there.’

‘‘Naw,” he concluded. ‘*You’ve
never seen it snow.”

He spat on the ground as
if to deliver his verdict and
walked away.

I still don’t know whether he
was pulling my leg. Sometimes
I wonder if he’s as serious as
he pretends to be, or at least
seems to be.

There are four things I'll nev-
er figure out: God, women, the
administration of Davidson Col-
lege, and Coach Fagg. I guess
that’s pretty good company.

Davidson Bid Hopes
For NIT Dwindle

The Davidson — basketball
team’s chances for a bid to the
National Invitational Tourna-
ment appear to be rapidly
dwindling.

The sponsors of the NIT had
expressed a desire to invite the
Davidson cagers earlier in the
season, but the Wildcats’ loss to
East Caiolina in, the second
round of the Southern Confer-
ence Tournament appears to
have ended their interest.

The Davidson coaches had not.
received a bid by Wednesday,
and fourteen of the sixteen
places in the tourney have been
filled.

The bids for the last two plac-
es will be given out today and
Monday.

Assistant Coach Bo Brickels
said that the ’Cats may have a
chance to receive an alternate
bid.

“If Ohio State receives a bid,
they'll probably turn it down,
and if Tennessee wins, their bid

will be open also,” Brickels
stated.
_ It at first you
don’t succeed,
try try again.

Then quit. No use
being a damn
fool about it.
