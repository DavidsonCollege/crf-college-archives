There's No Excuse For Not Lifting Weights

Liz said. .

Davidson students spend several
hours every day workifg on their
mind. The self-discipline this re-
quires is amazing. But whatiseven
more amazing is that many don’t
even spend a half an hour every
other day working on their bodies.
Exercise should be acrucial part of
our lives as college students. Itisa
great way torelieve stress, to main-
tain or lose weight, and to keep
healthy.

For many reasons, my favorite
exercise is weightlifting. For those
who hate sports, lifting is an ideal
way to stay in shape. It burns calo-
ries, and tones your muscles at the
same time. More than any other
sport, itallows you to control which
muscles you develop through the
weights and machines you use, so
that you can build the body you
want.

Lifting, like any regular form
of exercise, will also raise your
metabolism. This means you can
eat more and not gain weight. For
dieters, lifting is the ideal exercise.
Many people who lose weight
actually get flabbier, because they
lose muscle as well as fat. Lifting
allows you to build muscle, while
you lose fat, so that your body is
_ firm and toned, Youneednoequip-
ment-- save an ID card to get into
Baker Sports Complex-- and the
machines are very well made and
easy to use. If you play sports,
lifting will increase your strength
and improve your performance.
You will be able to run faster and
longer, kick harder, throw farther.
Most sports require that team
members spend at least an hour a
week in the weight room.

Saving the Chattooga

By Amy Bertram
Recycle, reduce, reuse.
Conserve water, electricity, and

natural resources.

I know, you’re tired of hearing
the environmentalist pleas urging
people to help save our planet.

So in an effort to alleviate the
monotony of having the mostcom-
mon environmental tips repeated
to the point that you don’ thelp just
for spite, the Davidson Environ-
mental Action group decided to
inform you weekly on new and
exciting ways to help.“save the
earth”,

Besides the everyday efforts,
writing your senators about vari-.
ous issues is critical to make nec-
essary changes. One of these is to
obtain more land surrounding the
headwaters of the Chattooga River,
from Cashiers to Highlands, N.C..,
tohelp preserve the Chattooga wa-
tershed. Ze

jectives better describe the SO mile _

Lifting is a very positive way to
expend energy. When you’redone,
you feel like you’ ve really accom-
plished something. You will proba-
bly also be a lot easier to live with
if you lift weights a few times a
week. Instead of

writing this column is that I am
forced to research things I had just
a basic knowledge of before. In
doing so, I find myself often sur-
prised at how little I do know about
these topics. Ihavealways scanned

half of your muscles virtually un-
touched.

it often proves too tax-

it will be a relief to know that you
can go down to the weight room
and do something productive with
your time, something good for
yourself.

If none of this convinces you,
then I challenge you to-think of a
good reason not to lift. “I have no
spare time” does not count be-

cause I have yetto.meet anyone

who cannot spare a half hour three

One of the best things about

From its modest beginning in
the mountains outside Cashiers,
N.C., the Chattooga snakes its way
through the rugged terrain of the
Carolinas and through rock gorges
and through steeply wooded moun-
tainsides.

The Chattooga is also one of
the few remaining free-flowing
streams in the Southeast. Stunning
scenery and proximity to major
urban areas suchas Atlanta, Green-
ville, and Charlotte bring thousands
of visitors each year to the area.

The region surrounding the

Chattooga has become amecca for

second homes and resort and golf
course development.

’ As the pulication states, “this
popularity comes with a price. As
this area grows and becomes more
popular, the everincreasing devel-
opment pressures will resultin deg-

_radation of the pristine waters of

the Chattooga form erosion, silta-
tion, and sewage.

"While the main body of the
river is protected under the Na-
tional Wild and Scenic Rivers Act,
many of the tributaries are not.
Protecting these sections is crucial
to preserving not only the river’s

the health articles I caught between
such pieces as “Makeup! Expert
Tips for Beauty Dweebs” and““Guy
Anxiety: His Eight Greatest Love
Fears,” but “Thinner Thighs in Ten
Days” just doesn’t bring you the
whole story. So, listed below is a
quick scan of some interesting
points regarding weightlifting that
Icame across while checking some
sources outside of Mademoiselle:
*Aerobics, running, walking, etc.
just don’t cut it. While cardiovas-
cular fitness is indisputably amust,

serious consideration of anyone
trying to be health conscious. 65
percent of your muscles are above

‘the waist. While aerobics class

might be giving your legs a good
workout, it’s leaving more than

surrounding watershed, but also
its distinct, untamed beauty.”

' Although much land has been
acquired through the diligent work
of the U.S. Forest Service and the
Trust for Public Land, the river is
still in danger.

The NOC needs people to write
their Congressmen and Senators to
aid in the situation of this river.

I encourage you to not only
take action to protect the beautiful
Chattooga River but to go on one

mobility.

*For those who lift two to three
times a week, a complete body
workout is recommended. If you
choose to lift everyday, alternate
your upper and lower body work-
outs for maximum results. Resting
your muscles for48 hours between
workouts is your best bet.

*Most sources recommended
spending: between 15-30 minutes
lifting. If it takes you less than 15
minutes, you probably have poor
technique. The Lapko room can be
congested at times; itmay take you
longer to access all the machines.

*More repetitions with lower
weights tones your muscles, while
fewer reps with heavier weights
increases strength.

*Women, for those of you who
express concern about acquiring a

bulky, masculine build, your ex-
cuses for avoiding strength train-
ing are groundless. Weightlifting
and Bodysculpting are twoentirely
different areas. Those looking to
develop a defined and bulky body
spend hours in the weight room
and begin witha strong background
in strength training followed by
mega repetitions with lighter
weights. 15-30 minutes of weight
training will not give you a body of
this kind. I can’t think of any other
reason to avoid the weight room;
after all, Mark Puckett graduated-
- it’s acceptable for us to be there
now.

*Resistance is the key. It should
take you no less than two seconds
to lifta weight and four to lower it.
If it takes you less time than. this
you are risking injury and: not
working your muscles to their
maximum capacity.

*Try to increase your weight by
five percent each week or when
12-15 reps becomes easy for you.
Otherwise, stay with 8-12 reps..

*For those interested in

weightloss: lean muscle burns 40-
50 more calories per day than fat.
By picking up just three more
pounds of muscle, you burn 120-
150 more calories per day, even
when-you are sedentary. Increased
metabolism resulting from weight
training also has been linked to the
direct reduction of cholesterol in
the blood, thus making your cardio-
vascular workout even more effec-
tive.

Lapko room, she is the woman to
