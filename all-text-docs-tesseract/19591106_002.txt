THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

A Challenge-And An Opportunity

The nine-schooi survey (see else-
where on this page) only makes more
explicit what we have felt for some
time. The Davidson system of atten-
dance regulations is badly outmoded.
It does not place the primary respon-
sibility for gaining an education on
the students, which is where it should
be found.

Our basic objection to the system
is this: a college should not stop with
teaching a student the contents of
books and instructors’ minds; an
equally important aim should be the
full development of a person’s ma-
turity, responsibility, and sense of val-
ues. This is the sort of thing that
would require no material investment
on the part of the. college. Trust and’
confidence in the students would be
the only investments necessary.

How Else?

How can a person learn these vir-
tues better and more rapidly than to
be given the opportunity, and how
can this process be more impaired
than to have this opportunity with-
held?

A bird will fly no sooner. than he
is pushed out of the nest. A man can-
not learn to swim if he does not get
into water. A person will not, in most
cases. develop maturity and respon-
sibility if he is hand-led through
every decision.

One main objection to a more lib-
eral system of class cuts seems to be
the idea that the Davidson student is
too immature to realize the implica-
tions of such a concession. He is liable
to lose perspective with the prospect
of making his own decisions and may
turn’ into an utter academic failure.

Is this not a rather premature
conclusion? Who can say what the re-
sult will be if the student is given
this opportunity? To condemn his
yet unknown reaction is like failing
him without giving him the examina-
tion.

Courage Required

Another objection is the fear that
a more liberal system would result
in a lowering of class standards. We
admit ;that the institution of such a
system presupposes a good deal of
courage and fibre on the part of
the instructor, He must not be afraid
to fail a student when necessary,
even though the instructor feels that
the student has the capability to pass.
After all, a college career consists of
developing one’s talents, and not to
graduate on the basis of latent, pre-
dicted capabilities.

But if the faculty ¢an meet this
challenge, which we think it can, the
result would be a more interested and
perceptive student body. The chaff
would be gone, and the real desire
for an education would be heightened
among those students remaining.

A more liberal cut system may,

we admit, result in a higher student:

mortality rate, but those who fall will
be the ones who don’t have a full
appreciation for a higher. education,
didn't have the real equipment for
college in the first place, ones who
are wasting their own time and that
of the college.

It seems to us that the college
is perhaps lowering her standards a
bit when she feels chat she must
force a student to learn whether he
wants to or not. The faculty should
present an education and let the stu-
dent absorb it if he chooses. If he
so chooses, he will gain an education
in more ways than one, having
learned the invaluable lesson of self-
discipline and appreciation.

Proposal

It-is with these thoughts in mind
that we propose the following atten-
dance regulations: that there be no
change in the requirements for
Physical Training, Chapel, Vespers,
and ROTC: that all freshmen, sopho-
mores with -a previous semester’s
average lower than 2.0 and juniors
and seniors with a previous semes-
ter's average lower than 1.0 be sub-
ject to class attendance regulations
as they now stand; all other sopho-
mores, juniors and seniors be given
the privilege and responsibility of
optional class attendance; that there
be no unexcused absences whatso-
ever from laboratories, seminars, and
discussion groups; and that every stu-
dent be required to meet the last
class before and the first class after
a holiday, with the penalty for vio-
lation the loss of all cut privileges
for thirty days. The Dean’s- office
should have the privilege of waiving
the last requirement for students
with holiday jobs. :

An Opportunity

This is an opportunity for the
faculty to do a great thing for its
students. The least it can do is to
examine and test every available
policy that may increase the value
of a Davidson education. This is a
chance to really prepare the Pavid-
son graduate for the unsheltered life
he will meet upon leaving school. If
a more liberal cut system doesn’t
work, fine. Let the faculty throw it
out. But after it is thrown out, the
faculty cannot be accused of negli-
gence because it did not try. We're
betting, though, that such an action
won’t be necessary.

The faculty is the group which
can take action on this proposal. We
are prepared to defend it to anyone,
including the faculty, both as indi-
viduals and as a group.

We hope to see a careful consid-
eration of this proposal! at the next
opportunity.

Quiz Shows Versus Education

Charles Van Doren is guilty and
thousands of blazing newspaper head
lines have proclaimed the shameful-
ness of his act. But equally as shame-
ful to our way of thinking is that the
whole cause of education and knowl-
edge has been prostituted.

The big gift shows have made
knowledge a show piece. The egghead
flaunts his knowledge just as the
magnate exhibits his new Cadillac.
Such a display of knowledge seems
to be proof of intellectual superiority.

But the desire for knowledge

motives. Knowledge is not just some-
thing to exhibit to prove one’s. in-
tellectual status. Knowledge is a tool
—not only to facilitate some technic-
al task—-but also a tool necessary
for leading a well rounded, satisfying
life.

We who profess the value of a
liberal education must realize this or
else our education becomes a sham
or at best only a period of collecting
facts that we can spew out in later
years to prove we have been to col-
lege.

Letters Are Whimsical, Caustic

Glynn Hughes

Dear Editor:

Monday, sitting in thoughtful
solitude with my Alka Seltzer,
it. seemed a lot easier to, look
back on Homecoming dispas-
sionately.

Weighing up the pleasures

of an Americantype dance
‘weekend against the casual-
ties incurred — through the
football game, car smashes,
getting pinned, and so on—
it seems it was quite a suc-
cess. :

But even with so compara-
tively few casualties, thera is
definitely room for improve-

‘ment. And I think this could:

be easily done with a few small
ehanges.
First of afl, why not have

a real gladiator show or bull-
fight instead of that nasty
rough football game? Much
more exciting, and of course,
no worry about the home
feam losing. Secondly they
ought to ban this glut of cars
which appears on Campus ov-
er the weekend.

Then there’s . this strange
weakness the Davidson student
shows in letting himself be
monopolized by his date. He

watches the football game with
her, goes out to dinner with
her, dances with her, parks
with her, and then wonders
just what it was that hit him.

‘Safety in numbers’ is an
old maxim: to forget it is to
put yourself at a serious dis-
advantage from the begin-
ning. So take somo advice
from the Old World — pass
that date around a little. Let
her circulate.

They tel] me that the inmates
of Belk,. which was: re-invaded
about 2:30 Sunday afternoon,
spent quite a time disposing of
bottles, pieces of clothing, odd
carrings, and other interesting
leftovers. Next year, they are
looking forward to seeing the
visitors settled into tents pitch-
ed over on the soccer field.

Dear Editor:

This is a guide to all students
angry enough to write letters
to the editor, printed in the
hope that it will be of great
assistance.

_ 1, Make sure that you are
really mad. If, whatever
- you’re writing about doesn’t

fill, you with blind wrath,
wait until after R.0.T.C. drill
er an unfair review; then
write your letter,

2. Make as many sarcastic re-
marks as you can; make your
words sharp and your wounds
deep. Remember, the more cuts
you make, the more blood will
be spilled.

3. Stay clear of any con:
structive criticism. Be sure
that the entire letter is a
scathing attack on some as-
pect of life at Davidson, or,’
better yet, on the college as
a whole.

4. Include some new caustic
attacks. on at least one of the
following: The admissions
policy, with specific reference
to Mr. White; the ‘Davidson
Gentleman” -at Vespers; tradi-
tion and apathy; and Dr. Pol-
ley’s chapel speech.

5. Rub salt into old wounds;
keep controversy and scandal
alive. But most important,
doublecheck. to make certain
that nothing constructive will
ever come out of your cynical
tirade.

6. Use this article as a guide
to more effective and more de-
vastating criticism.

Survey Of Top Colleges Shows

By DICK SMITH
Assistant Editor

EDITOR'S NOTE: During the
past month the DAVIDSON-
JAN has polled nine colleges
and universities concerning
their absence regulation poli-
cies. All of the institutions
queried (selacted on a basis
of reputation, quality and the
editors’ helief that informa-
tion from other schools would
be helpful in determining a
sensible absence policy for
Davidson College) sent re-
plies which are summarized
below,

tt should be noted thet the
editors had no previous
knowledge of policies at the
schools selected for question-
ing and that every answer re-
ceived is included in this ar-
ticle,

_ DARTMOUTH

Students are expected to at-
tend each scheduled class “reg-
ularly.” No mention is made as
to what is considered “regular-
ly.” If a student fails to do so,
his negligence may be taken in-
to account by the instructor in
determining the student's final
grade.

The Dean of the College
writes that “Our present pro-
cedure is to have no policy at

all.”
YALE

“Regular” attendance again

required. Sophomores on the
Dean's List, Juniors and Sen-
iors are not held to a limited
number of cuts, except in
courses in which active parti-
cipation is required, such. as
labs, ‘seminars and discussion
groups.

All Freshmen and Sopho-
mores not on the Dean’s List
are allowed a maximum of
twenty cuts in all courses each
semester, not to exceed five in
each course.

Yale does not differentiate
between excused and unexcused
absences. The Assistant Dean
remarks. “The Yale College
faculty feels that members of
the junior and senior class are
mature enough to decide for
themselves the question of
class attendance.”

PRINCETON

“Undergraduates are expect-
ed to attend all of their sched-
uled University exercises ... .”
Cuts allocated to freshmen and
sophomores are determined by
their instructor; “There is no
regular reporting or central re-
cording of absences for juniors
or seniors, but they are placed
on probation if reported by an
instructor has having been ab-
sent too often, and their atten-
dance thereafter is checked by
special reports.”

The Assistant Dean of the
College makes it clear that “We
have felt for some time that

our old system of close super-
vision and restriction of under-
classmen was no longer neces-
sary for students almost all of
whom go to college with a seri-
ous purpose. We are putting
the responsibility directly on
the student and hoping that our
faith in him will prove justi-
fied,’ and that the necessary
control over the few who are
not yet mature enough to or-
ganize their own lives will be
provided by members of the
faculty or, in extreme cases,
the Dean of the College,”

UCLA

UCLA's one paragraph in the
Regulations dealing with this
subject reads, “Every student
is required to attend all his
olass exercises and to satisfy
the instructor in each of his
classes that he is performing
the work of the course in a
systematic manner.”

Says the Assistant Dean of
Students, “The instructor is
given the broadest leeway in
carrying out campus regula-
tions, and there are some who
are more lenient on this sub-
ject than the regulation would

indicate.”
BROWN

Each student is allowed three
unexcused absences in each
course, with the following ex-
ceptions; Unlimited class cuts
are the privilege of Sopho-
mores on the Dean’s List,

DAVIDSON NOTEBOOK

“Get Thee Learning, And
From Learning, Wisdom”

Launched into college with the stern directive Get

ye learning, and from learning, wisdom, the college stu-
dent inevitably. looks toward the professor as a source

of inspiration and guidance.

The professor, by virtue of his position, is assumed
to be an enlightened man, one whose superior sensitivity,
insight, and understanding are an exemplification of

the worth of the education which he is to pass on.

a

The heavy and demanding responsibilities of the
conscientious professor are well enumerated in this para-
phrase of one teacher's remarks made thirty-five years

ago. The professor should seek:

To have patience, that he may thoroughly learn the

supreme art of teaching, which is to wait;
To stimulate curiosity and feed it;

To turn. fear to courage, to make the weak will

strong, to transform indifference into ambition, to shame
self-pity into self-confidence;

To obtain strength and that gentleness which is the
garment of strength; to refrain from weakness, and from

petulance and tyranny which are the signs of weakness;

To develop a mature mind, a sense of values, and
the ability to distinguish between essentials and non-

essentials;

To possess a wise blindness to the faults of exuber-
ance and a wise evaluation of enthusiasm;

To strive not so much to be cajled master as to be
a master, and not to show authority so much as to have
it;

To remember always the profits of his calling, the

satisfaction-of pursuing a noble task; and to learn humili-
4
ty, that he may continue to learn while he teaches.

It is reprehensible when a professor so inadequately
meets these standards that his teaching fails to com-
mand the student’s respect and interest. It is inexcusable
when the student meets with disillusionment in such
dull classes and must seek elsewhere for inspiration—in

books and companions more stimulating than profes-
sors.

It is tragic when the professor, fearful for his self-
respect, denies him this opportunity to learn and chains
him to a round of everlasting, compulsory, unimaginative
drudgery:

SEWANEE

Same class cut: policy as that
of Davidson, with this excep-
tion: “Students who have
earned membership in the Or-
der of Gownsmen are granted
the privilege of ‘optional class
attendance’ (unlimited cuts).”

Membership in this Order is
based on grades of the previous
semester. Those eligible in-
clude Sophomores with the
equivalent average of 2.0, Jun-
iors holding a 1.25, and Seniors
with a grade point average of
1.0.

A student is dropped from
the Gown when he fails to meet
the requirements, but may be
reinstated upon remeeting the
required average.

HARVARD

“Regular attendance at col-
lege exercises is expected.”
“Students whose names are on
the Dean’s List will be trusted
by the Dean with greater re-
sponsibility and discretion in
the matter of attendance, as far
as this does not interfere with
the collective interests of the
classes or sections to which
they belong.”

; The Dean of Students adds
in the accompanying letter, “As
you will note, the wording of
our statement is general and
allows considerable latitude. I
should add, therefore, that each
case of class cuts that is
brought to the attention of the
administration is treated on an
individual basis. Our policy to-
ward attendance is a liberal
one, and we only take action
when a student abuses the free-
dom we mean him to enjoy.”

So far as absences before and
after holidays is concerned, the
following applies: Princeton
records double cuts. Atten-
dance is required at Williams,
Yale, Brown, and Dartmouth.
Warvard students are merely
“expected not to extend the
Christmas or April recess.” No
mention of the question is

made by Amherst, UCLA, or
Sewanee.
