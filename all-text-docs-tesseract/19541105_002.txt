Tuesday’s Election And The Future
Of Our Country

Last Tuesday witnessed the mid-term
election throughout this country, but
Tuesday aroused no greater speculation
in the Davidson student body than wheth-
er or not drill was to be called off. Some
forty-five million Americans went to the
polls with men, events, and issues in
mind; while we plodded to class with no
higher thought than an impending re-
view or an unfinished translation. While
we bided out time in class, the men who
will shape the future of this country and
the world were chosen. Granted not all
of us could have voted, but how many
of us were at all familiar with the national
political seene and its important issues
beyond those of the races of Jonas vs.
Sedberry, Scott vs. West, and Thurmond
vs. Brown?

The personal effects of politics are
real, yet seldom considered. Lower taxes
(leaving our parents more money), and.
the avoidance of a major world conflict
(which would draw us into service) are
but two examples of the practical side of
politics as it directly concerns us. In a
few years we will be leaving this cloister
to enter a world largely shaped by the
men elected last Tuesday; therefore, it
seems that we should be acquiring a
knowledge of politics as well as studies.

A little less related, yet of significance
to us, is the interpretation of the election

outcome on national and international
levels. A Republican victory would pri-
marily constitute a vote of confidence for
Ike. Our economic equilibrium would be
maintained with some unemployment yet
with high production even without a war
market. The trend will continue from
government domination of lerge enter-
prises toward more private business.

If the Democrats win, Ike's prestige
will suffer a blow that may influence him
not to run in 1956, leaving the way open
for Stevenson. Foreign relations should
show little change, but domestic issues
may bog down. Such projects as Missouri
Valley Authority will again be preposed.

The world, generally speaking, looks
on a Republican victory as providing
greater assurance for stable foreign rela-
tion. In addition, our econemy will be
less likely to fluctuate with a Republican
congress; therefore, making our foreign
aid flow steadily. However, a Democratic
majority in Congress is looked on with
favor by many Europeans because it
would remove McCarthy from his con-
mittee chairmanship.

Let us as college students, make use
of our freedoms of speech—in pull ses-
sions — press—in publicly stating our
views, and voting above all, so that there
never will be a time when we are with-
out these privileges.—T.F.

A: Consideration of the Davidson Gentleman

Unfortunately the term “Davidson
gentleman” has lost its real meaning to
most of us and has become a rather glib
term of derision of a sort. The two words
apparently connote the catch all phrase
to be used in punishing some misdemean-
ant whose conduct cannot be placed cata-
gorically in the grasp of one of the copi-
ous supply of rules under which we here
live. This writer is opposed to the idea
of having such numerous and petty rules
disgracing our code, but he is even more
appalled at the adverse reflections that
many of these cast upon the student body
ftself. Would rules be formulated if there
were not offenses with which to be dealt?

Time and again we hear criticism for
treating the Davidson students as being
more immature than we really are. The
sad part of this criticism in the mind of
this writer is that it is essentially true,
but under our present government do we
act always with a reasonable amount of
maturity?

The problem is a lack of respect, tol-
eration, and consideration on the part

of some for the rights and privileges of
others. This is immaturity—immaturity
which the large majority of adults retain.
These particular incidents epitomize some
of the reasons for our having so many
petty regulations which should not have
to be. The actions of a few can, and do,
affect the majority.

. Perhaps part of the answer to so maby
of the student’s criticisms of the David-
son system lies in our re-evaluation of
the term “gentleman.” Readily we admit
that our democratic society does not tend
to produce what is known as the English
gentleman, but then our term “gentle-
man” does not imply high breeding, etc.,
but rather respect for another’s ideas,
toleration for his beliefs, and an attempt
at understanding. The freshman “speak-
ing rule” has not been incorporated as
a method of hazing, but to teach an out-
ward manifestation of a real gentleman—
friendliness.

Our nation needs more gentlemen and a
great many less boors; perhaps David-
son could do with the same thing —D.H.0.

Omicron Delta Kappa

Omicran Delta Kappa is said to recog-
nize men who have attained a position of
conspicious leadership an the campus dur-
ing their first three years here. It natural-
ly follows that those who have secured
the highest offices in the student body,
such. as those of President of the Student
Body or of the Y. M. C. A. should be taken
into Omicron Delta Kappa.

Beyond a few top men in top offices,
however, there begin to rise in the minds
of some students the questions of what a
man must do to be chosen for Omicron
Kappa. Must he have a certain
mumber of points as added up in accord
with an outmoded article of the Constitu-

E

number one, two, three, and four in lead-
ership as can Phi Beta Kappa its initiates
from the record of scholastic attainments
hese. The choosing of leaders must be a
mach more vague thing, and it is this
which can lead to many

demands a certain scholastic average,
without which no man can be tapped.
There has been some misunderstanding
of this in times past, but it is a fact that
is strictly adhered to in the nominating
of new members for the society.

Further, ODK has no method of judg-
ing between the ability or the worth of
men for membership beyond the associa-
tions with those men during the past years
and their activity on the campus. Often
a man is involved in many activities for
which he gets very little or no recogni
tion. This, strictly speaking, is not con-
spicuous leadership. But who can deny
that it takes leadership to work well be-
hind the scenes in college, where so much
emphasis is laid on the strutting and fret
ting in front of the multitudes.

Herein ODK finds its true strength as
a leadership organization. It is not an
organization to honor those who stand out
above all the rest but also those who spend
their lives here working for the better-
ment of the college and of their fellow
students, but who by chance or choice
seldom mount the rostrum of fame. Recog-
nizing students as such ODK becomes an
active organization on campus, working
through its members for the betterment
of the college.

~“Cateniem”

But now Mr. Taylor has a third
definition of “Graggism” and I
quote, “. . . those individuals who
have never known what it is to
perform a manual or menial task
and who probably never will.” How
ridiculous when Mr. Caton, “a com-
placent exponent of Graggism,”
works regularly in the Union. I do
not know Mr. Caton, and thus I
have been able to enjoy his contro-
versial editorials without a per-
sonal bias for or against him, but
I fear that “Cetonism” is headed
for four years of notoreity. In my
case the charge is also a little ex-
aggerated after spending a sum-
mer working in a settlement house
in the Bowery (it was fun!) in New
York City. I believe some of the
tasks that I had would qualify as
menial, but then, who is to say?

Another Cult
Also in last week's paper, Mr.

bert’s Gibberish” (oh boy! New la-
bels to use!) we have more of an
international scope to our editor-
fals. I am certainly concerned that
two-thirds of the world go to bed
hungry every night, Mr. Firor, but
I, along with 849 other students,
am enjoying my prosperous mid-
dle-class existence too much to
worry about the volcano that is
already beginning to simmer and
will be boiling over on our chil-
dren in Asia or Africa.

I am certainly as guilty as every-
one else.

I agree that our editorials need
broadening and will be looking to
more “Firorcity” and the pene-
trating and  thought-provoking
writings of some other well-in-
formed analyst of the current
scene. Indeed, it is the desire of
the staff for as many students as
possible to contribute editorials or
letters to the paper, as certainly
the overworked regular columnists
do not have especially relevant ma-
terial each week.

Present Duke Numbering System
Explained: Response To Fite

Deer Editor:

Contrary to the opinion express-
ed by Mr. Fite in last week’s De
videenian, there is some degree of
reasan in the numbering of rooms
in Duke Dormitory.

While it may serve as a first-

these buildings which demand eur
reverence and reepest, it sheuld:in-

the wise and thoughtful generosi-
ty of the donor.” It behooves the
Callege to help it bear its witness
to this generation.

Sincerely,

In The Dark

ing system was not designed spe-
cifically for those purposes.

Mr. Fite’s error is not in wish-
ing for a sane numbering system—
he fails to see that one already ex-
ists and would be perfectly intel-
ligible if it were explained. His
proposal to use W, C, and E to
designate the west, center, and
east entrances is redundant, be-
cause those entrances are
indicated in the room numbers.

Hew System Werks

For the benefit of all the Duke-
dizzy people on the campus, here
is the numbering system as I have
deduced it.

Reems with numbers | through
20. are located on the third floer
and can be reached from both
east and weet entrances. Those
numbered 1 threugh 10 are en
the west side; 11 threugh 20 are
on the other side of the curieus
herseshee bend in the hall.

All reems with three digits
use the fellowing system: the
¢iest digit indicates the fleer, the
seeend is the entrance number
(1 Is west, 2 is center, and 3 ts
eset); end the third is the reem
number, beginning at the left of
the stairs.

Thus it is obvious that Mr. Fite’s
room is on the first floor, west en-
tranee, and is a suite of rooms on
the right of the stairs (double num-
bers such as 116-17 indicate suites
and 7 is the maximum number of
rooms in the end sections.)

The system is there: it just

Are Our Public High Schools
Really Preparatory Schools?

Bditor’s Note: This articte is
a theme prepared by Gnglish Il.
it is submitted through the cour-
tesy of the author and his in-
structor, Professor Benjamin
Wilson. .

I am greatly dismayed st the
lack of college preparation one
receives today in the public high
schools. Not too long ago, my fa-
ther and I were discussing the edu-
cation of his father. Although my
grandfather never went any far-
ther than the eighth grade, I would
be willing to wager that, at the
end of his schooling, he was as
intelligent as the average high
school student is today.

Many people today will argue
that back in those days the prac-
tical things were not taught. These
people are prone to forget what
one goes to school for. School is
the developer of the mind. Two
generations ago, boys did not have
to go to school in order to learn
how to drive; driving was taught
by their fathers. They went to
school in order that they might
develop thelr minds. In those days
a highly developed mind was the

highest ambition of a boy. It is
a known fact that‘ well educated
people are, by far, the most suc
cessful people.

Driver Training Courses

‘My grandfather studied English
rhetoric, Latin, and physics. There
is a trend today, Modernism, which
teaches that, instead of these
things, the practical things in life
ought to be stressed. We might
consider one practice in this trend
to be drivertraining courses. This
trend is changing the whole pur-
pose of school.

It does not take a highly de-
veloped mind to drive a car; often
this is very evident in many of the
drivers we meet on the road. So
why should our time in high schoo!
‘be wasted in practice? There is a
difference between practicing un-
til you succeed and studying un-
til you understand. Therefore these
practical courses, such as driving
and typing, do not require study,
they merely require practice.

Practice of physical skills improv-
es the body; study improves the
mind.

There must be a revival in learn-

ing if our public high schools are
really going to prepare their grad-
uates for a college career. If a
student takes the easiest courses
in high school, and makes straight
A’s, he has not actually prepared
highself for college.

The average high school student

whole text. ,

lege work,

Proper Techniques Outlined For
Grad School Recommendations

On my desk lies a typed sheet

of paper which a student handed.

me last week. On it he has written
briefly and clearly his name, class
standing, major subject, scholas-
tic honors, student body offices,
athletic and extracurricular activi-
ties. Also, he has stated his profes-
sional school objectives and his vo-
cational aim. A few weeks before
giving me this information he ask-
ed me if I would be willing to give
him recommendations when he ap-
plied for a fellowship or position.

This paper, to which I have re-
ferred, might well serve as a model
of proper procedure for all stu-
dents who, during their senior year
or at any other time, call on their
instructots for this service. I
might add that it is a procedure
more often honored in the breach
than in the observance. This stu-
dent is not bragging or “tooting
his own horn.” He is making read-
fly available to me the details
whieh I shall need in order to
write the kind of reference I want
to give him. This thoughtfulness
will save me many minutes, pos-
sibly even hours, of poring over
catalogues, transcripts, and an-

nuals.
Four O'clock Deadline

An actual experience stands out
as a contrast to this man’s modus
operandi.

This incident occurred on the
Davidson campus. About three o’-
clock one afternoon, a senior who
had done distinguished work with

BY DR. J. WILSON MeCUTCHAN

to
it. He answered, “It has to be
the mail by four o'clock this af-
ternoon.”

I did my best for my young
friend, but not even a professor of
English can produce the kind of
reference or recommendation he
would like to write under time
pressure of this sort. The incon-
venience to me in having to lay
aside other work was a minor con-
sideration. Far more important was
the fact that the man was hurting
himself in not allowing me time
to prepare a carefully worded
statement about him and his out-
standing talents.

Students are a teacher’s product.
He Is proud of them, or should be,
and he wants to “sell” them in the
sense of helping them to secure
good scholarships, fellowships,

and many regard a student's re-
quest to do this as a privilege and
an honor.
The Pour Principles

There are a few principles, how-
ever, which students should bear
in mind, and I address myself to
those who will be requesting this
service during this semester and
the next.

(1) Mention your intention to the
instructor before he suddenly re-
ceives the request from an admis-
sions board or scholarship eommit-
tee. This gives the teacher an op-
portunity to recall your best quall-
fications and “to give you a break.”

(2) Tell the instructor what you
are applying for. Sometimes he can
give you a strong and favorable
recommendation for an applica-
tion of one sort when he cannot in
one faith meommn end you for an-
other. There is no personal preju-
dice in this, for it is no favor to a
student to “boost” him for a place
for which he is not qualified.

(3) Always allow an instructor
ample time to prepare the infor
mation he is. supposed to supply.
If he must rush to meet a dead-
line, he cannot do you justice.

(4 So far as you can, be certain
that you get the right people to
ssubmit the right references. To
know a man’s academic record or
to know him in the classroom is
one thing; to know what he does
during Christmas vacation or dur
ing the summer is another. Do not
expect a teacher to guess of use
his imagination. It does the appll-
veant little good for a person whom
the applicant has named as a refer-
ence to reply that he does not
know the student well enough to
‘have an, opinion. .

. remember that your in-
structors want to help you.as much
as they can. Give them the best
oesible chance to do it.
