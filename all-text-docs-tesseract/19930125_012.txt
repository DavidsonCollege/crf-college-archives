against its figurative counterpart.
In a sense, he challenges the cat-

egories of public and private, self.

and soul.

Crull is as interested in the
technical aspect of his paintings as
he is in the metaphorical and sub-
jective. He uses a variety of pal-
ettes in the works seen in Cham-
bers. Several works are strictly
black and white, others pastel, and
one entitled Winds of Chance
(1986) uses violent reds and deep
green. St. Sebastian (1989) has an
impasto so thick it seems to flow
off the canvas like lava.

In spite of the sense of imme-
diacy he conveys in the applica-

tion of the paint, the viewer be-
comes aware of the subtle organi-
zation of the piece. Each canvas
has a wholeness ‘which does not
limit the viewer to its particulari-
ties. This effect is limited in multi-
panel pieces as the division be-
tween panels isnearly insurmount-
able for the eye. The proximity of
the panelsallow them to beconsid-
ered as a unit, but he uses the
divisions as a symbol of the di-
chotomy so prevalent in existen-
tial metaphors. Crull manages suc-
cessfully the complex and even
chaotic portrayal of a soul-search-
ing confrontation within the realm
of cohesive composition.

long enough to give us another
album and finally go back on tour
--without his hat.

-I could go on for hours, but
one story overshadows them all
for 1992. The 3,491st show of the
Grand Ole Opry was like any other
for the past 54 years, and it was
sadly lacking. In November of
1992, the King of Country Music,
Roy Acuff, died, leaving the Opry
to goon without him--something it
had done for only the first13 years
in its 67-year history. To say he
left shoes that can never be filled
does not begin to memorialize the
legend that was Roy Acuff; to say
he will live forever in the heart of
Nashville isan understatement. But
he left us his Opry; and as long as
it lives, so will he.

-Finally, the best songs on the
radio that peaked in the 1992 cal-
endar year? It’s atough call off the

top of my head, but I'll try:

-"What Kind of Fool Do You
Think I Am", Lee Roy Parnell

-"The River", Garth Brooks

-"The Greatest Man I Never
Knew", Reba McEntire

-"I Saw the Light", Wynonna
Judd

-"Jukebox With a Country

Song", Doug Stone

There were other greats by
Garth, Randy Travis, Wynonna,
and Collin Raye, but this was sim-
ply a quick shot at an all-star list.

So that’s a very, very quick
look at 1992 on music row. And

1993 looks like it’s off to the best —

start it could have. Why? Garth is
singing in the Super Bowl (for the
Boys), and his "Somewhere Other
Than the Night" - one of his very
finest songs - was the first #1 of
1993 ... on all three charts. Did I

A small, Who are you

A small girl contentedly sits alone —

friendly room You who intrigues me so :
pea oe chaser, eran: So often that it makes me wonder
‘While outside there rages a violent storm. Wonder who you are _
Mutual friends made us acquaintances

ade oe re re ~ Mutual feelings are making us friends

The storm beyond, it breaks the bond

‘and enters the house as the girl looks on,

What mood do you wish to present

a ee ta te He aoe Is it meant to embrace my lonely heart
Oris it a platonic nature presented

‘The futile walls frown and come crashing down
As the frightened girl fights to make a sound.

She crouches where a corner used to be

Three feet in front of her face she can’ tse -
The darkening schemes, the opening seams
Each dashes her hopes and shatters her dreams,

A voice of unreason shouts in her head

Another makes threats that could scare the dead
The girl shuts her ears, but can’t fight the tears

As inhuman screams are all that shé hears. .

A gentle and recognizable hand

Its presence the girl could never have planned
Lifts her out of the shadows of her doubts
While the storm, it ebbs, thus losing its clout.

The small girl sits and waits in her chair

Of the past events she is well aware

Though the rain. has eased, though the voices have ceased
Their aim to destroy has not been appeased.

Yet the girl is proud of the life she owns

She sighs contentedly:
She is not alone.

“Who Are You?”

Mutual desires may make usacquainted
With something far greater than a vee —_

To arrest my emotions before they start

The game we may be preparing to play

It reeks of other such past events

I am talking of similar games I have played
Where I incorrectly read my opponents’ intents -

But this. is a new and better season

Filled with the promise our fantasies engender
And you are my intriguing teammate seasoned
With the spice that continues to make me wonder

Who are you

You who baffles me so

So often that it makes me admire
Whoever you truly are
