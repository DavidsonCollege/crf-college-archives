1987 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Dr. Ringle explores graves with students

By JENNIFER HOFFMAN

Recently, thirty Davidson stu-
dents and assisstant professor of
anthropology, Dr. Ringle, were
seen at the sites of several commu-
nity graveyards: Some strange
new religious cult-to hit campus,
perhaps? No, these students are
members of the archeology class
Dr. Ringle is teaching this term,
and graveyards have served as
sites for the class’s lab on several
occations.

Graveyards, or “communities
of the dead,” as Dr. Ringle terms
them, reveal a lot about past cul-
tures and customs. When studying
a Site, students divide into groups
and make maps of the arrange-
ment of the cemetery. Students
then note such information as
size, shape, position, and material
of tombstones, as weil as names,

.birth- and death-dates, epitaphs,
and symbols on the markers. After
collecting the data, the informa-
tion is transferred to the computer,
where it is stored and later
analyzed for patterns. Davidson

Out of these differing norms
grow a great deal of misun-
derstanding about sex and re-
lationships. Intimacy is often
excluded from sex. The dating
game sets men and women up as
social adversaries. Women say no

students have collected data from
the town cemetery on North Main
Street, Hopewell Cemetery~near
Charlotte, and Ramah Cemetery.

Studies thus far point to a high
infant mortality rate. According to
Ringle, “With-300 or 400 names
in the computer so far, in the years
up to 1900, 20 percent of all chil-
dren died before their 10th birth-
day. But the stones show a fair
amount of longevity, too.”

An overgrown lot near the
Lotta Plantation has served as
another site for archeological
study. Once a farmhouse, all that
is visible now are a few bricks.
The first step was to clear the lot,
and map the area. Students have
unearthed other portions of the
house structure through their dig-
ging, as well as discovering sev-
eral pennies, a-fork, and a boot.
This project has provided the op-
portunity to practice various ar-
cheological techniques. Cristin
Williams is presently using a new
procedure which tests for the pre-
sence of phosphate in the soil at

and mean yes. All men are wom-
anizers. Women like to be
roughed up a little.

“She never said no.”

This adversarial nature in
male-female relationships _ is
damaging to people. Men who can
only rélate to women in this way
deny themselves the expression of

the site. High phosphate levels in-
dicate human habitation of the
area.
All of the students in the class
are also involved in individual
projects. These range from com-
parisons of male/female grave-

sites, studies of white and black
cemetaries, and attempts to date
the farmhouse near Lotta. In addi-
tion, some students are research-
ing Davidson’s past. Sophomore
Charles Houck is digging in hopes
of locating the remaining founda-
tion of Stuart Hall.

This summer, Dr. Ringle will
continue his excavation and map-
ping of a Mayan city near Val-
ladolid, Mexico. Students Aaron
Cohen and Charles Houck will be
assisting. The National Geo-
graphic Society is sponsoring Dr.
Ringle’s study, and the project is
now in its fourth year. The site, lo-
cated on the Yucatan Peninsula, is
of special interest because it lies
between two powerful regional
centers. Ringle is investigating

-

sexual intimacy that is uniquely
human. Women are often irrever-
sibly damaged by rape, carrying
with them a uncontrollable fear of
men and intimacy.

Burkhart stresses understand-
ing of this adversarial relationship
as a giant step toward changing

the influence each of these had on
the city’s cultural and architec-
tural styles.

The anthropology department
has big plans for the future of ar-
cheology at Davidson. The school
has recently installed a new lab,
and is presently accumulating new
tools and technology. This term’s
class is the first to record data on
the new computer system, and re-
sults will become more accurate
with the addition of input from fu-
ture classes. With the growing in-
terest, students are hopeful that
more advanced archeology class-
es will be offered.

“It’s really fascinating to see
how much can be learned from ob-
jects of the past,” said Cristen
Williams. “Comparing customs
and trends of yesterday with those
of today help us realize just how
things have changed.”

the situation: “Understanding is
coercive,” he says, “once men un-
derstand that sexual aggression is
wrong; they won’t do it.” The
biggest problem is admitting that a
problem ‘exists. Once this hurdle
is cleared, then much of the work
is done.

Some men don’t see that
forced sex is wrong. 98 percent of
rape is acquaintance rape. It is
legitimized to the point that it be-
comes a good thing. A woman’s
best defense against sexual ag-
gression is to understand her own *
needs and to articulate them
clearly to avoid ambiguity: “I am
not comfortable with this, and I
intend to have you stop right
now.”

Burkhart concluded by saying
that sex and aggression are not ap-
propriate bedfellows. The power
struggle manifested in sexual ag-
gression is a great tragedy of our
society. Only through education
of men‘and women can ariy effec-
tive change come about.

A group of students is working
to bring about change and aware-
ness of the problem on the David-
son campus. Davidson COllege

educational services and support
services so can the college com-
munity learn before the fact.

DCRC provides immediate
counseling for the rape victim,
later referring them to a counselor
and providing support services.
Their 24-hour hotline, now routed
to Charlotte (375-9900), will be
transferred in the fall to Davidson
to provide immediate 24-hour
crisis intervention.

Presently, DCRC employs
peer counselors who hold office
hours from 7-9 p.m. in the Rape
Crisis office in the Union. The
number there is 892-2000, ext..
148. These counselors go through
a rigorous 20-hour training pro-
gram with follow-up programs
held throughout the year. The of-
ficers for next year include co-co-
ordinators Sherry Reynolds and
Lisa Clark, treasurer Carla de
Beck, and secretary Cally Ham-
mond. Lee Hall will be a peer
counselor. -

What Davidson manufactur-
ing company competes with few
other Southern firms, produces
two completed products annually
and manages to maintain a na-
tional reputation?

Blakely _Organbuilders em-
ploys six people, two of whom are
students working part time.
Operating since 1968, the firm
constructs organs at its Depot
Street location.

The company builds new or-
gars and services older instru-
ments. Restoration, while not the
primary focus of the company,
takes up a considerable amount of
time. Lee Torrence, Davidson
class of 1983, says, “Complete re-
storation is about as complicated
as making 8 new instrument.”

Organ maintenance requires
traveling through North and South
Carolina and Virginia, Torrence
said. Employees tune 35-40 or-
gans twice a year.

The firm designs its organs for

specific settings on a commission .

basis. Blakely Organbuilders gen-

though employees have built one

All the company’s organs pos-

able and more sensitive musi- in organ at Davidson and attended

he wanted to make organs rather
than play them.”

‘Blakely worked for Wicks
Organ Company, which designed
and built Davidson College Pre-
sbyterian Church’s organ.

Having travelled to Spain and
France to study organs and organ-
making, Blakely handles drawing
up the initial plans and finishes
every instrument tonally. Torr-
ence completes mechanical work,
while a head cabinetmaker pre-
pares each case.

Torrence became interested in
organ-building as as part-time stu-
dent employee. Although he tunes
‘instruments, he does not read
music. “I’ve always been inter-
ested in music. Construction of an

instruments that we can play mod-
em music on...not a
harpsichord that nothing’s being
composed for,” Torrence said.
Ralph Blakely (°67) majored

Local resources include the
college library, particularly its
copy of Diderot’s Encyclopedia.
One of only a few complete sets in
the nation, the set includes an
organ-making treatise written by
monk Dom Bedo. Torrence said,
“All the organ builders in the
country have heard of it; people
look at the pictures and talk about
it.” -

Torrence also cited David-
son’s proximity to High Point
hardwood suppliers.. “This is
probably the best place in the
country to get wood,” he said.

One thing that._sets. us.
apart . . . (is) being .in Davidson
where we have Professor Welsh
actively composing for the organ.
Mr. Blakely (the firm's founder)

feels that we should be building -

organ requires that you have really
broad knowledge,” he said.

Like Blakely, Torrence did
not study organ-building for-
mally. “The only way to learn is to
apprentice to someone, really.”
An English major, Torrence grew
up in several cities, although his
local connections include his
grandfather’s birth in Davidson.

He denied having a favorite
organ project. “If you work on
something that long, you have
mixed emotions about it,” he said.

Organ construction requires
an ordered process; Torrence des-
cribed the steps involved, begin-
ning with visiting the site. “It’s
important that the church under-
stand what they’re getting,” Torr-
ence said.

Employees and the client de-
termine the instrument’s size;
Blakely then executes a design.
“The physical appearance of the
organ tries . . . to blend with the
architectural surroundings and the
sound,” Torrence said.

« Builders next construct a wind
chest, the unseen box for Pipes
necessary for each keyboard and

pedalboard. American Guild of
Organists guidelines contain
keyboard specifications. Blakely
Organbuilders purchases pedals
and keyboards but builds its own
wind chest. Torrence called
keyboard standardization valu-
_able: “We think it’s better if it’s
going to be in a church, and we
don’t know who the organist is.”
Supplying air to the wind
chests constitutes the next organ-
building step. Blakely Organbuil-
ders installs an electric fan blower
and mechanical air regulator,
Torrence said. The final stage
consists of construction of the in-
strument’s case. Firm employees
then transport the completed
organ to its site.
Torrence attributed organ-
‘ building’s resurgence to Albert
Schweitzer’s 1940s study of
Bach. Dutch and German man-
ufacturers revived the craft, but
American organ-builders have
seized the lead. “Most of the firms
that are doing the best . organ-
building are very small firms
much like this one,” Torrence
said,
