Among the female members of the touring Players,
Inc., troupe is the lovely Susan Walker—Lady Anne to
the Chambers Auditorium audience which this week saw
the Players present “Richard I.”

Susan, a 24year old drama
graduate from Miami Univers-
ity, is doing this tour as a re-
eult of receiving a Players’
Award from the Catholic Uni-
versity of America in Washing-
ton, D. C.

ONCE STAGE-SHY

At a coffee hour after the per-
formance, Miss Walker. a for-
mer Cherry Blossom Queen,
traced her career up to becom-
ing a member of Players. “At
Bennett Jr. College and Miami,”
she, reminisced, “I was always
active in dramatics, but usually
in backstage work: However,
two of. my profs at Miami en- .
couraged me to do more actual
acting, and gave me the neces-
sary confidence to overcome my
stage. fright.”

After graduation, Susan tour-
ed for a year with the Barter
Theatre, a company from Abing-
don, Virginia, a top-ranking
company which has produced
‘such stalwarts as Ernest Borg-
nine, Gary Cooper, and Greg-
ory Peck. Then came an op.
portunity to re-enter drama un-
der the auspices of a college,
where, Sue says, “An actor or
actress receives much individ-
ual attention, while in the pro-
fessional world, if you're not at
the moment useful, you just
exist.” Sue went to Washington
to audition for a part in Catho-
lic U.’s Players Plan, and was
soon notified of her acceptance.

in addition. she was granted
ene of the two annual Players’
Awards. “All recipients of the
Award tour with the troupe for
one year; then, it is up to the
University whether we shall
study, do summer stock, prepare
for another tour, or whatever.”

GRUELING TOUR

The Players, after six weeks’
practice, tour from October to
May, from Maine to Florida and
westward to San Antonio, Texas.
They often do as many as seven
or eight performances a week,
and they perform for high
school, college, and community |
audiences. This is the 13th year
of Players, part of a large-scale
drama sponsorship by Catholic
U., which also operates two
summer stock theatres.

“Players is great experience,”
remarked Susan, “but not only
in the obvious area of acting.
With 16 people to fill 34 parts
and do lighting, staging, cos-
tuming, and make-up work as
well, we all get a wide variety
of experience. In “Richard 11,”
Lady Anne backstage becomes
the assistant stage manager and
the sound coordinator.”

With two station wagons, a
large property truck, and a tight
and harrying schedule, life on
the tour must become hectic at
times, to say the least. It is in-
deqd, confirms Miss Walker.
The work is hard and tiresome,
and “mornings often come too
early.”

However, the Players are
young, and their work in this
tour is one more step towards
improving their capabilities and
their chances to reach New
York or Hollywood. Susan re-
marks, “Of course I like to
think there’s someone big in the
audience who will admire my
performance. But the big thing

is to know that I’m improving
myself and doing what 1 love.”

MARRIAGE VS. STAGE

_ Has marriage competed with
the career of such a beautiful
young lady, not far removed
from the coed set? “I firmly
believe that marriagé and the
stage can’t be mixed. I never
seem to think of all this ending
and I'm sure I've passed up
many things, including mar.
riage, and not even known it.”

Just how high do this parti-
cular young actress’ aspirations
reach? “I want to become a re-
spected actress, if not a star. Of
course I want especially to work

‘in New York, and I'd also love

to do some movie work in
Italy.”

Sue remarked on the interest
that their performance usually
arouses in audiences which have
little opportunity to view live
drama. Let it be said that the
Davidson gentlemen has equally
meager opportunity to view
such charming femininity as
Miss Susan Walker.

True reform is based on what

past in synthesis with what the

statesmen (reformers, men of

what Woodrow Wilson once call-

My platform deals with a re-

unit. “But all students who are
placed in aviation will have to
stay on active duty for three
years,” he said. “This is not
much worse than regular ROTC
graduates who now have to go
active duty for two years.”

President D. Grier Martin has
already approved the program
for next year if enough students
desire it. The college will be
under no obligation to offer any
credits to students participating
in the course. “The entire pro-
gram will be extra-curricular;
it will in no way affect the
ROTC program not being offer-
ed,” Threlkeld said.

The schedule for the course
will be determined by the
private schedule of the in
dividual student taking it.
“Some students may finish it
in one semester, for some it
may teke longer,” Threlkeld
explained.

are the text and flying clothes

“A flying school will handle
all instruction and give all

ROTC personnel will have any-
thing to do with the course.”

The purposes listed by

Threlkeld for giving the pro-

gram are as follows: to create

a reserve pool of qualified

vate college students to seek

to screen applicants for army

“The program will give all
interested students an excellent
opportunity to learn to fly at

keld said in lauding the course.

MS III's who would iike to learn
how to fly to sign up for it. I
believe we already have enough
interest now to make the pro-

equipment gram worthwhile.”

Ex-Intelligence Officer
Returns To Education

BY TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonisn Feature Writer

“Twenty-five years is a long time. But! wanted to finish what I had started.”

These words were spoken by
Mr. H. S. Isler, a grey-haired
man of about 45 who sits in the
senior section for chapel three
times a week. Needless to say,
he doesn’t sit there because he
likes the programs; he is a stud-
ent here with 38 more hours
needed to graduate.

He came here for: the first
time in 1934. In 1936 he left
school for a pretty fair reason—
money. Then came a variety of
jobs: cashier for an insurance
company, employment with the
Seaboard Railroad, and several
more that he wouldn’t care to

|'mention. In 1941 he was drafted

and went to Coast Artillery OCS
school. Isler saw action at Nor-
mandy with an anti-aircraft bat-
tery.

The war came to an end, but
something about the army held
Isler. He volunteered to go on
Army Intelligence School, and
he came out equipped to do the
important job of evaluating in-
formation supplied by our cloak-
and-dagger men.

NOT ALL FUN

“Don't let any adventure
stories fool you on the role of
the intelligence at work,”. he
told mé. “Most of it is just hard,
unglamorous work, examining
data and things like that. I
mainly did desk work overseas,
serving most of my time in
Germany and Iceland. You
know, even though Uncle Sam
never admits that he has any
spies, he likes to keep tabs on
even friendly governments.
That’s what I was doing in Ice-
land. The work is pretty inter-
esting; you'd be surprised at
some of the things we find out.”

But Isler didn't care to com-
ment on what some of those
“interesting things” were. ‘Old
Uncle Sam doesn’t like for his
information collectors to say
much about what they do,” he
said with a grin.

“I spent my last few years as
an enlisted man so that I could
get in 20 years for retirement,”
he went on. “My highest rank in
active service was major, and I
retired as a lieutenant colonel
in the Reserves. But they cut

out my class a few years ago, .

and I stayed on until I could
retire.”

WORKED IN CAROLINAS

His last years in the intelli-
gence were spent in the Caro-
linas checking into the back-
grounds of army personnel who
were applying for classified
jobs. “The people in the South
are basically better than you get
in the larger northern cities,”
Isler said. “There are not nearly
as many subversive elements
down here. About the only thing
you have to watch out for is a
man who is a heavy drinker or
gambler.”

But Isler is back now. “Just
bullheadedness on my part,” he
explained. “I'm really too old
to come back here and do all of
this work. I am not doing it for
the fum of it, I can tell you

‘that.” He is majoring in history
with hopes of teaching until he
ean put his son through N. C.

—

. Lo

State. “Then it’s travel for my
wife and me,” he laughed.
DAVIDSON TOUGHER
How does Davidson stack up
with the school of the 30's.
“There's a good deal more out- -
side reading to do for all of the
courses now,” according to Isler.
“It's really tougher, whole lot
more so. The only professor
that is still here that I can re-
member is Dr. Schenck. I can re-
member names of the ones I had
but not how they taught. But I
do know that the way they teach
now is a lot harder, and the
quality of students is better,
too.”

Isler hopes to receive his
diploma with next year's senior
class. “I'm getting 15 hours off
this semester. Then I only want
to take four or five courses each
of the next two semesters. It's
too tough for an old man like
me to try and take more than
that; things up here are rough,”
he lamented.

THE CLOAK AND DAGGER are set aside by Mr. H. S. Isler
in favor of continuing his education. He will graduate with the

class of 63.
