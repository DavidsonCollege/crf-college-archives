Love
Davidson
Symphony

Orchestra is
here to stay

By Liz Locketr
Staff writer

Last Monday night, the
Davidson College Symphony
Orchestra performed the second
concert of their inaugural sea-
son, under the baton of Richard
Prior. The repertoire consisted
of classical pieces by W. A.
Mozart and F, J. Haydn, as well
as a romantic Piano Concerto
by Edvard Grieg which featured
the fabulous pianist and faculty
member, James Swisher.

Many had eagerly awaited
to hear the harmonious sound of
the orchestra once again, and the
audience’s high expectations
were fulfilled, if not exceeded.
The orchestra has dramatically
escalated in ability and musical-
ity since their first concert in the
fall.

The program opened with
one of Mozart’s finest works,
the Overture to Die Zauberflote
(The Magic Flute). Although

mostly serious in nature, the
opera also features several comic
moments. The ensemble con-
veyed the solemn atmosphere of
the plot while maintaining the
comical element with artistic

touches such as the crisp, abrupt

tempo change to Allegro.

This opening piece imme-
diately illustrated the musical
precision and accuracy of the
group. The well-balanced or-
chestra expressed a dynamic
sense of responsive interplay,
creating a light and lively dia-
logue. The piece ended with a
powerful cadential movement
which anticipated the forthcom-
ing music.

The orchestra performed
their most difficult and challeng-
ing piece next, Haydn’s Sym-
phony No. 45 in f sharp minor.
The difficulty arose due to the
semi-programmatic nature of the
piece. Beginning with the oboes,
each instrument was gradually
phased out atthe end of the fourth
movement until only a duet vio-
lin part remained, performed by
Amanda Merril and Elizabeth
Parker. This portion of the con-
cert exposed the extraordinary
talent and ability of each indi-
vidual section.

The crowd was astounded

by the closing number of the |.

An American Poe

Philip Levine presents writing

By Mary STEPHENS
Staff writer

Davidson’s 900 Room was the
first stop for poet Philip Levine

after the announcement that his -

most recent collection of poems,
The Simple Truth, won the 1995
Pulitzer Prize for poetry.

Levine told the audience Tues-
day that they were lucky he had
won the award, because otherwise
he would be ina foul mood and not
nearly as entertaining.

Levine, the Writer-in-Resi-
dence at Vanderbilt University
(“writer-in-silence,” he calls it)
during the 1994-95 academic year,
is no stranger to recognition for his
work. He received the American
Book Award for Ashes (1980), the
National Book Critics Circle
Award for 7 Years from Some-
where (1979), and in 1991 he was
awarded the National Book Award
for What Work Is.

He read selections from his
New Selected Poems (1991) in-
cluding “My Son and I” and
“Heaven,” along With the title poem
and “No Buyers” from The Simple
Truth, and a few unpublished po-
ems.

Noted for his willingness to
write for and about the unheard
voices of America’s downtrodden,
Levine’s subjects range from
Detroit’s blue collar factory work-
ers to Spanish anarchists.

According to Christopher
Buckley, the editor of a collection
of essays on Levine’s poetry, his
poems “engage the smug and un-

generous powers of the world and
make anger and moral indignation
stand up for the disenfranchised.”

Levine facilitates this connec-
tion with his subjects primarily
through the use of persona poems
which allow him to assume differ-
ent voices and express conflicting
perspectives.

He is not constrained by con-
ventions, actuality of time and
place, or point of view.

Not this pig.

Levine spoke candidly about

the problems of communication
between men and women, adding
that poetry is the closest we can get
to communicating without the use
of our bodies.

Throughout the reading he
jokingly patted himself on the back
for his new Pulitzer, remarked on

how bad the losers must feel, ca-

joled the audience, and mentioned
repeatedly that the pitcher of water
onthe podium was actually straight
vodka.

His humor and his unflinch-

‘ing honesty combined to give what

he later referred to as “hope for our
poems,” with emphasis on our.

Levine also announced the
1995 Vereen Bell awards for cre-
ative writing.

Rachel Newcomb ‘95 and
Geordie Schimmel ‘97 tied for first,
while George Weld ‘95 took sec-
ond place.

Third place sent to Will Boye
“95 and Jack Livings ‘96. Shayna
Chazin ‘96 received an honorable
mention.

Performing the Shrew

Shakespeare class gives the
sixteenth-century classic a modern feel

By Emity SIMMons

Staff writer

loften find ithard to get into Shakespearean
plays, not only because of the language, but also
because of all the metaphors and other jokes
directed at a sixteenth century audience. This
was not the case with the Performing Shakes-
peare class’s version of The Taming of the |

Shrew.

This version of the well-known
Shakespearean comedy sheds new lighton some
old themes, appealing more to a twentieth cen-
tury audience. In addition, a lot of the gestures
and motions let in the audience members on a fF

lot of the jokes and metaphors. .

This version of the classic has some new
interpretations about the place of women and
men in society. The. program even has the
definition of “shrew,” which highlights the fact
that only now does that word refer to women (or |,
wives) who are “given to railing or scolding or
