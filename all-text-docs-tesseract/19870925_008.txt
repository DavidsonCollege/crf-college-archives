After kicking off the 1987 sea-
son with a 4-1 victory over Salem
College, the Davidson field hoc-
key team (record: 1-2) went
through a frustrating week. The
Wildcats lost 6-0 to the more ex-
perienced Duke blue devils on Fri-
day and 3-0 to High Point College
on Monday.

The Duke battle was played
almost entirely on Davidson’s de-
fensive side. However, the fiesty
wildcats held the tough Blue De-
vils to only one goal in the first

+

half. The second half was another
story. As Duke exploded with five
more goals, the cats fell apart.
Coach Betsy Pryor commented,
“we got frustrated and tired. We
didn’t have any transition game
and crossed the fifty [midfield]
only once.”

The astroturf playing surface
didn’t help the Wildcat effort

either. Davidson plays on turf,

only once every two years, and
has been unsuccessful. Coach
Pryor added, “the game was a re-
flection on how difficult it is to

Things did not get any better
Monday for Davidson as High
Point College stunned the Cats, 3-
0. Even after returning to a natural
grass field and anon-ACC school,
the girls still could not recover
their offense. Many times, David-
son had the ball in front of High
Point’s goal but could not score.

“We had a serious mental break-
down, offensively and defen-
sively, and we were not aggres-
sive enough in the circle,” pointed
out coach Pryor.’ AC

‘Basketball team begins
training. The 1987-88 version
of Wildcat basketball has begun
training in anticipation of the
season. Although they cannot
begin practice with basketballs
until October under NCAA reg-
ulations, they have undergone
an intense conditioning pro-
gram, involving running,
swimming, and weightlifting.
The outlook looks promising
for continued success with star-
ters Derek Rucker, Jay Schmitt,

and Mike Gynn returning.

Baseball team victorious in
fall action. The wildcat baseball
team defeated Lenoir-Rhyne
College 9-5 in action this week.

Several Wildcat pitchers, nota-
bly Greg Wilcox and Jay Har-
ris, performed admirably. The
two sophomores combined for
four innings of shutout ball. The
fall season will give the new
wildcat coach, Jim Stoeckel, a
chance to review his talent and
look at many new freshmen try-
outs.

‘Trivia question. What
pitcher holds the major league
record for the most consecutive
victories? (Answer next week.)

Take a hike list. This week:
1. Norby Walters and his ilk — ‘

these men of questionable re-
pute have ruined the lives of
several young men by enticing
them with money, as well as

having destroyed the basketball
program at Alabama, and the
football programs of Pittsburgh
and Ohio State. 2. The four
horsemen — Flair, Anderson,
Blanchard, and Luger, the
N.W.A.’s brand of the Notre
Dame quartet, seem to fight
only when the numbers are in
their favor. Otherwise, they run
for the hills. Look for the super-
powers, Rhodes and Nikita
Koloff, to run them for good
soon. 3. Gary Carter — “the
kid” is much too annoying to
appear in the World Series
again this year. We’ve seen a
lifelong supply of curtain calls.
Let’s hope the Cardinals finish
off the Mets during the regular
season.
