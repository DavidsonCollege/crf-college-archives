Women's Issues Committee
Promotes Equality For All

By Laura Blair
The 1991-92 Committee for
Women’s Issues, headed by Bess
Murchison and Courtney Nichols,
has an informative and innovative

year planned. The main purpose of ~

the committee is to educate the
student body about the necessity
ofrecognizing equality for women.
The committee. is by no means
gender exclusive and strongly an-
ticipates and encourages the par-
ticipation of men.

The committee respects all
degrees of feminism from radical
to liberal. They realize that all
feministsdonothate men, but many
plan to marry and have a family.
Their main goal is equality for
women. Murchison and Nichols
stated,““As for the members of the
student body who have expressed
such limited tolerance for the con-
ceptof feminism, our only response
is that people are most often scared
of things they do not understand.

By Caroline Nelson

Each week The Davidsonian
spotlights several of the YSSC
programs. This week the spotlight
is on Davidson Elementary Tutor-
ing and Habitat for Humanity.

Participants in the Davidson
Elementary Tutoring program
volunteer one day a week to help
elementary-aged kids with their
homework. It gives Davidson stu-

Weare here to dispel those fears.”
A recent event sponsored by
the committee under the guidance
of Sara Carlson was “Take Back
the Night.” The main goal was to
promoterape awareness. Over 120
people turned out to hear three
Davidson women speak about
personal experiences with rape and
sexual abuse, The brother of one of
these students also spoke on behalf
of his feelings about his sister’s
experience. The speeches were
followed by a candlelight. walk
through the dark areas of campus.
After the walk, the remainder of
the group went to hear a speaker
from the Shelter for Battered
Women. The majority of the group
tied ribbons on a tree symbolizing
either their experiences with rape
or those of a close acquaintance.
Murchison and Nichols have
great plans for the upcoming year.
They plan to make “Take Back the
Night” an annual event and to have

Among the speakers they hope to

ity. There will also be more films

leaders of the committee will be

which will be a handbook of
women at Davidson.

In«-closing, Murchison and
Nichols would like to leave you
