Clarke Pitches Good Game But Caro-|Spann Knocks Home Run With One

lina Wins 4-3.

In the initial game of the North
Carolina trip the Wildcats lost a 15-
inning contest. to the University of
North Carolina by a score of 4 to 3.

‘This, the annaal contest between these
ancient rivals, was witnessed by a large
assembly of enthusiastic fans.

The Wildcats had many opportunities
to annex the game. A total of fifteen
Davidson men were left on bases, but
the batter was always lacking with the
needed hit. On several occasions, with
men on second and third, with only one
man down, the Wildcats were unable
to make the hit that would count for
runs. The Wildcats were the first to
get in the run column, their one tally
resulting from a pass and a single to
center which went for a three-bagger
when the fielder permitted the ball to
yet away from him. -

In the second round Carolina tied up
the score with a home run driven over
the left field fence by Robbins. ‘The
University scored two more in the fourth
on a single and three errors. It was

in the eighth round that the Wildcats
annexed two more runs, assisted by Caro-

Scene at Blue Ridge

lina errors. In the fifteenth a single by
Younts brought in the tally that proved
the winner.

‘Two errors and a walk allowed two
Davidson men to perch on second and
third, with only one man down, in her
half of the fifteenth inning. The much
needed hit was not forthcoming, how-
ever,

The pitching of Clarke for Davidson,
who went the entire route, and the work
of Joyner for Carolina, were the out-
standing features of the game.

FIRST ELON GAME.

April 22—In the most thrilling
game of baseball ever seen. on the Elon
diamond, Elon College defeated David-
son College in a 13-inning game, 7 to 6.
The game was witnessed by a large
crowd and being void of errors and with
plenty of “pep” and exciting plays af-
forded the close observer of — baseball
what he likes to see.

The game started off with a swatfest
for the visitors, four hits in the first
frame, scoring three runs. Doughton
was replaced by Sides, who pitched a
steady game thereafter. Guing to the
mound with one man on, he held the
Presbyterians to five scattered singles
the remainder of the game and was com-
plete master in pinches.

The Elon team scored one run in the
first frame and four in’ the — second,
making a tie score of 5 and 5. Davidson
managed to score one in the fourth fol-
lowing a base on balls, a sacrifice and a
beautiful squeeze play. Brawn, Elon’s
husky right fielder, caught a fast one
square on the nose and drove it for a

home run, making the score again tie,
6 to 6,

tun. King’s bad hop to Davidson's sec-

, Winston's celebration for her returned

|herves, and 2,500 persons witnessed the

game. After the first frame when the

handed catch by Simpson, of Elon, of a
line drive by Richards to deep center
after a forty-yard dash was a feature of
the game.

game, allowing Elon but four _ hits.
Spann placed the ball over left field
fence, with a man on base, for a home-
run. Ratchford fielded well and landed
on the pill for a pretty three-base hit.

CLASS BASEBALL GAMES.
FRESH-SOPH.

In the second game of the inter-class
series the Sophomores lost to the Fresh-
men by a score of 5 to 2. The game was
fast.and well played throughout. Mur-
phy pitched air-tight ball for the Fresh-
men, allowing a total of only three hits.
Murray, too, pitched well but allowed
the Freshmen to bunch several of their
seven hits for their five runs, “The Fresh
team got off to a good lead in the early
part of the game and held it all the way
through. Good fielding on the part of
their outfield probably prevented further
scoring.

The pitching of Murray was the main
feature for the Sophs. Miller, for the
Freshmen, played a high class ball on
third and his home run was one of the
main features of the game.

ln a rather uninteresting game, play-

Freshmen. Neither team was able to
connect effectively with the slants of the
opposing pitcher. Davenport let the
Freshmen down with only three hits,
while Miller yielded only two to the
Seniors. ‘The Seniors’ runs came as a
result of errors by Hyland in the. first

two innings. ‘The Freshmen threatened

to score at several times during the game
but were unable to get a man past third
except in the sixth inning, when McLeod
crossed the plate with their only tally.
‘The pitching of Davenport and the
catching of Robson featured for the Se-
niors. Ratchford played a nice game
on first for the Freshmen.

JUNIOR-SOPH.

‘Thursday afternoon witnessed an old
fashioned slugging match on Sprunt field
when the Juniors stacked arms against
the Sophomores. The former team was
victorious by a-score of 13.to 4. Cathey
allowed the Sophs only seven scattered
hits and received good support from his
teammates, while the Juniors hit Doug-
lass often and hard. ‘The score would
have heen different, however, if it had
not been for the numerous errors cred-
ited against the Sophs.

Murray played a good game in the
field for the Sophomores besides getting
three successive hits. ‘Phe entire Junior
team played good ball.

came back in good form, after making
several changes in their lineup, and de-
feated the Seniors by a score of g to 3.
Hammett twirled in great style for the
Sophs, holding his opponents safe at all
stages of the game. Davenport started
in the box for the Seniors but was driven
to cover in the seventh. Currie, who.
relieved him, succeeded in holding the
Sophs but little better.

Douglass starred for the class of ’21,
doing great work both with the bat and
in left field. urner played a nice game
