Junior standout scores in scrimmage game.

Terriers To Visit

By BOB MEADOWS
Sports Writer

Wofford College will
face the Wildcats in the
last Davidson home foot-
ball game tomorrow at 2.
Even with an off week
last week and two weeks
preparation for the meet-
ing with the Terriers,
head coach Homer Smith
voiced concern over the
’Cats readiness.

“At this moment our de-
fense is not ready and we
have not yet put together the
type of offense that we have
worked toward. We hope
these two phases will be
ready by Saturday.”

Although complimenting the
Davidson team for its per-
formance during practice in
the colder weather, Smith
said that he is more con-
cerned with this game than

Talented Cagers Face

Roughest Season Ever

By DANNY WHITE
Assistant Sports Editor

“IT won't say that this year’s
team is the best I've ever had
at Davidson, but I will say it
sure has the potential to be,”
said Davidson basketball
coach Lefty Driesell recently
commenting on the prospects
for the coming roundball sea-
son.

Too many people. including
most pre-season basketball
publications, think that Drie-
sell’s comment is conserva-
tive to say the least. The 1967-
68 season has been tabbed as
the “Year of the return to the
nation’s Top Ten" for the
Wildcats by Davidson basket-
ball faithfuls.

The °67 Wildcats have im
pressive credentials. First,
the Wildcats did not lose a
single man from last year’s
varsity squad which was 15-12
and second place in the
Southern Conference. In ad-
dition. Driesell has a host of
outstanding sophomores wait-
ing in the wings. The super
sophs include Doug Cook and
Mike Maloy. both 6-6: Jerry
Kroll and Jan Postma. both
&-4: and Fox Demoisey, 6-1.
These men posted a 16.0
record during their freshman
season—the first undefeated
Wildkitten team ever—which

included seven triumphs over

Atlantic Coast Conference
competition.
However, Lefty's Legions

must play the toughest sched-
ule in the Southern Confer-
ence this year. -The schedule
includes 10 Southern Confer
ence games. as well as inter-
sectional clashes with such
traditional powerhouses as
Duke. St. John’s. St. Joseph’s,
Wake Forest, Michigan, VPI
and Vanderbilt.

The Wildcats will also host
the Charlotte Invitational
Tournament with Temple.
Rice and Miami of Ohio com-
peting. Davidson also plays
in the Sugar Bowl Classic in
New Orleans. competing with
Vanderbilt. Michigan State
and Memphis State.

‘I would havecto rate our
schedule as the toughest I’ve
had to play since I've been
at Davidson.” said Driesell.
“It would have to rate as one
of the toughest in the nation.”

Leading last year’s re-
turnees are senior captain
Rodney Knowles and junior
Wayne Huckel. The 6-9
Knowles averaged 18.4 points
and 12.0 rebounds per game
and rates as a solid All-
American candidate..

Also returning is, Huckel
whom Driesell has called the

greatest hustler he’s ever
coached. Huckel was a first
team. All Southern Confer-
ence tournament selection
last year when he poured in
28 points in the finals against
West Virginia.

Starters Dave Moser, Tom
Youngdale and Mike O'Neill
plus sixth man Mike Spann
also return from the ‘67 var-
sity.

“I have no idea who our
starting five -will be this
time.” said Driesell. ‘but it's
really not important. I plan
to play nine or 10 players a
whole lot. Anyway it’s the
five that finish the game
who are important.”

“We may even use a pla
toon system this year,’ con-
tinued Driesell. ‘‘However.
that's highly tentative be-
cause we're just in the experi-
menting stage with it right
now,"’

“Pre-season ratings don't
mean that much,” said. Drie-
sell, commenting on the
team's ranking in the polls.

The general public will get
its first chance to see the
‘67.'68 edition of the Wildcats
in action tomorrow in an in-
tersquad clash following the
football game. The Annual
Wildcat-Wildkitten contest is
scheduled for Nov. 18.

Booters Drop Pair
As Offense Falters

By KIM GRIFFITH
Sports Writer,

Soccer teams from NC
State and Duke proved too
strong for the Davidson boot-
ers, as the Wildcats dropped
two games in the last week.
State downed the ‘Cats on
the Davidson field last Sat-
urday 3-1. On Wednesday the
Blue Devils of Duke hosted
the ‘Cats, handing them a 3-0
defeat. Davidson's scoring
threat was mild both games.

The State game was a hard-
fought contest in which tem-
pers flared often. Coach Har-
ry Fogleman called the game
the roughest soccer he had
seen in several vears. ‘The
officials just let the game get
out of hand. They did not call
the penalties that would have
brought the game under con-
trol." he said.

The Oavidson team was
Just as guilty as the State
players after the roughness
started, but Fogleman said
that you cannot blame a
player for defending himself.

The roughness of the play
set the style for the game.
After the action started Da-
vidson began to play State's
kind of game. The Wildcats
could not beat the Wolfpack
at this type of play.

Wednesday's loss to Duke
saw the last of the original
Davidson goalies injured.
Now Harry Hamil. Jeff Plain-
er, and John Lipfert have all
been lost for the season be-
cause of injuries.

Fogleman has had to train
players to play goalie, be-
ginning a week ago. Jim Mar-
Tow, a starting wing, and Ed-
die Rice, a fullback, have
been working at the goal po-
sition.

In the Duke game it was
the inexperience of the goal-
ies that allowed the Blue
Devils to score their three
goals, none of which were on
particularly powerful kicks.
The first- half was closely
played. with Duke unable to
seore until just before the
half was over. Then the sec-
ond half was dominated by
Duke.

“Against Duke we played
one of our best games, but

we were not able to get shots
at their goal,’ Fogleman
said. “Normally we take from
23 to 30 shots. Wednesday we
got only twelve.” Duke had
four times as many shots as
Davidson and was able to
control the offense.

The Wildcats last regular
season game was with Em
ery University. today in. At-
lanta. Next week the South-
ern Conference playoff be-
gins.

he has been with any game
so far this season.

The Terriers have some
outstanding personnel whom
they hope will be able to off-
set the Davidson attack. Line-
backer Bill. Burk, a 6-3, 230
pounder, and defensive tackle
Sidney Albred, 6-1. 220
pounds, are key men in Wof
ford’s defense.

Albred is as strong a de-
fensive tackle as the ‘Cats
have faced all season. Burk
has played well against Da-
vidson for the last two years.
Last year he was so effec-
tive that the Wildcats had to
move the ball away from his
side of the line. Still, Smith
said, he made many tackles.

Offensively, the Terrri.
ers depend largely on run-
ning back Ted Phelps. Kick
veturn specialist Vince Col-
ley is considered to be a
threat to the ‘Cats. ‘’Col-
ley is fast and very skill-
ful,”” Smith said.

Davidson will be playing
without the aid of Kit Thomp-
son and Steve Butler. both
out with injuries. However
the Wildcats will be strength
ened by the return of Tupper
Morehead who has_ missed
several games because of a
broken finger.

The ‘Cats will be counting
on the services of quarter-
back’ Jimmy Poole and °the
running of fullback Kerry
Keith. Poole, who led the na-
tion's passers before last
week, is only two completions
off the lead, having played
a game less than the leader.

“We have worked harder
in practice on our running
game than we have on our
passing." Smith -said. “Our
running has improved a great
deal because of this extra
practice.”’

Tackle Lowell Bryan and
defensive lineman John Giles
were praised by Smith for
their performances in prac-
tice sessions this week. Still
the coaches hope that: both of
fense and defense will be
ready for Saturday's game.

The Terriers use a split

line on offense which they
have not changed in many
years. “They have been
very successful with if so
they have no reason to
change,” Smith said.
“However, we do expect
some surprise formations,
such as pufting two men
on one side of the field, two
on the other side, and the
rest of the offensive unit in
the center of the fleld.”’

Another important factor in
Saturday's game is the rival-
ry between Wofford and Da-
vidson. Wofford is a school
roughly the same size as Da-
vidson. Every year the Wild.
cat game is the one that the
Terriers want to win the
most.

Top State Competition

Overwhelms Harriers

Davidson's cross country
team found the going rough
in the North Carolina state
meet. Monday in Raleigh.
The ‘Cats managed to finish
sixth, although they did not
have a runner finish before
thirtieth place.

Fourteen schools were en
tered in the match which was
won by ECU. Duke finished
second, then UNC and NC
State.

The Wildcat harriers beat
such schools as Pembroke,
High Point, Methodist Col-
lege and some other of the
smailer colteges entered.
Coach Heath Whittle said
that he was satisfied by Da-
vidson’s showing in the
meet, explaining that he
did not expect to run as
well as the larger schools.

Duke's Ed Stenberg was
the individual winner of the

meet, running the course in
25:25. His time bettered the
existing North Carolina rec.
ord by 30 seconds.

Jim McLaughlin, David-
son's strongest runner all
season, was the first Wildcat
to cross the finish line. He
placed thirtieth in the over-
all field of 102 runners. Mc-
Laughlin's time was 28:34.

Teammate John Puckett

out that the Bullpup of-
