A REVIEW
By JOHN. McLEAN
Managing Editor
Back in my home town
there is a particular group
of people—‘‘slummers" they
are called—who are just now

arriving to a_ higher sta-
tion in life.
Former’ slum _ dwellers,

these people are now finding
jobs — and respectability -
through the many new tex-
tile firms coming into the
area.

The movie ‘‘Midnight Cow-
boy” is somewhat remini-
scent of these ‘‘slummers.”

‘

dinary skin-flick is that, des-
pite the perversity which fills
every character in the movie,
Joe Buck retains his opti-
mism and basic naivite about
human nature.

Perhaps this is what made
him return to -Ratso time
after time. But his devotion
to this asthmatic cripple was
the only warm, supporting
relationship in the whole
film. And it provided a moral
vindication. for the  sordid-
ness which engulfed them.

“Midnight Cowboy” is a
consciously arty film. Nu-
merous flashbacks highlight
Joe Buck's boyhood. These
are good touches, and they
keep the audience busy try-
ing to analyze a protagonist
who keeps trying to Hide
his true self with male brag-
aadozih.

IT forget whom Marshall
McLuhan was quoting, but
the quote was something to
the effect that only in novels,
as opposed to life, do peo-
ple actually change.

By this yardstick at least,
Joe Buck 4s a character cut
