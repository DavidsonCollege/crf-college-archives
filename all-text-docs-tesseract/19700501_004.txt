Amerikan Kulture Invades’

Woodstock’s Dream Fare

A REVIEW
By BILL DAVENPORT

You want to find the truth in life,
Don’t pass music by i
Now f wouldn't lie am
No | would not lie \
Down in Montefey.

—Eric Burden, “Monterey,” 1967

“Woodstock” is only a partial success. Though the
movie attempts to make loaves for the multitude from
the offerings made upon the mammoth plywood stage
(altar) at the rural New York scene near the home of
the prophet, Bob Dylan, it only succeeds in making
one hungry for more.

Pardon the dubious attempt to establish religious
analogies. Yet in the pop festival one can find mani-
festations of some distinctly All“American motifs.
They are part Thoreau in the guise of the Canned
Heat singing “Going Up To The Country,” part Huck-
leberry Finn wanting to “light out for the Territories.”
Read Twain’s adventures of Colonel Bunkum some-
time. This preacher’s gospel revival (Creedence Clear-
water Revival?) camp meetings are fully as Dionysian as
anything staged in the Sixties.

To equip themselves for the three days of con-
certs, many Woodstockers made use of such arriere
garde accoutrements as Army tents and Sears Roebuck
Camper Trailers, just as they once undoubtedly did
for Boy Scout Camporees.

A further aspect of Amerikan Kulture is made
apparent in the structure of the documentary itself.
“Woodstock” is entirely a presentation of cyclic epi-
Sodes. One is presented with a brilliant rock act, then
switched to ascene of heads or townspeople or prep-
arations for the show, and then back to more music.

Implicit everywhere is Middle American social
optimism, the desire to make everything “come to-
gether,” as the Beatles say. The kids may have broken
down a fence, but rest assured, theatergoers, they
were not violent. Bad trips may have been numerous,
but the Army was right on hand with helpful medical
teams. Well so what! Who cares!

Perhaps I am a lone maniac, but what I expect-
ed (and what ‘‘Woodstock’’ failed to provide) was. ex-
citement. More specifically, I hoped for the excite-
ment of vicariously living the lives of my rock ‘n’ roll
heroes. The movie presents only the final orgasmic
moments of their performances. I wanted to know more
about them, to find out how they pick up girls or spend
days off. ‘

But what can a poor boy do

Why am I so curious about these performers?
It’s because there’s no one else for a kid to emulate.
What other young public heroes are there these days?
The political young Left is, it seems, about to be
liquidated. :

Few of us want to follow the military model or
become young Dagwoods in gray flannel suits or be
really earnest, tight-assed intellectuals—for reasons
too ridiculously obvious to mention. Butch Cassidy

Dorm Search Conflict Continues;

RHC May Stop Forced Entrances

AN ANALYSIS

By GRAY WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor
“Except in extreme emer-

gencies dormitory rooms
and student vehicles shall
not be searched except by
a person so’ authorized by
Dean of Students or the
chairman of the appropriate
court.”

This quote from the Code
of Responsibility comprises
the text of the so-called
“dorm search" policy at Da-
vidson, :

The statement is a source
of general apprehension
among some students, who
feel that the Code may have
been abused by prowling
administration ‘officers and
campus employes.

These accusations of an
invasion of privacy are
Particularly interesting in
view of the recent student-
faculty controversy over 24-
hour dorms.

Stagg Newman, chairman
of the-Regulations Court, ex
plained the procedures in-
volved in a room investiga
tion.

“To enter a room in or-
der to obtain evidence, the
person must have a search
warrent issued in accord

ance with the provision of

the Code."

In addition to a formal
dorm search, Newman _be-
lieves “that evidence’ ob-
tained while a person is in
a room with the permission
of the occupant would also
be admissible in court.”

But he added his inter-
pretation that “if a person
enters a room without either
the permission of the oc-
cupant or a search warrant,
any evidence he obtained as
a result of entering the
room would not be admis-
sible inthe court.”

.,Newman pointed out that

the dorm search policy is
roughly analogous to inves-
tigating procedures among
civil authorities, .but that
any school action must take
into account the provision
of the Code which states:
“No evidence in violation of
right of privacy shall
be admitted.” i)

The thefts were teported
to the Honor Court, but as
of publication, no action
had been taken and mem-
bers of the Investigating
Committee had not been of-
ficially charged to investi-
gate.

C. Burts Jr., denied that
there have been any dorm
searches recently, and that
any investigations to be
made would proceed only
with the proper authoriza-
tion in the form of a war-
rant.

He explained that the
campus” policemen who
make the rounds of the halls
each night are not allowed

to conduct any room
searches.
He affirmed. his belief

that the ‘current paranoia’
among students is quite
unfounded because it has
been over a year and a
half since a warrant was
last issued.

“Theadministration is in-
terested only in matters of
general concern to the wel-

No More
Spring
Frolies?

By TOM VERNON
Associate Editor

Two sophomores, Terry
Hirst and Cecil Burney,
have been.carrying on in-

formal discussions with stu-
dents and members of the
college administration on
prospects for  reorganiza-
tion of the social calendar.

They hope to eliminate
the three traditional big
weekends at Davidson.

Much of the information
used in their argument has
come from Mrs. Peter
Nicholls, Director of Student
Housing. In an_ interview
last week, Mrs. Nicholls
cited student dissatisfaction
with having to move out of
the dorms as a major fac-
tor.

In addition to this, how
ever, Mrs. Nicholls noted a
significient decrease in the
number of rooms needed for
dates over the past few
years, and an increase in
the number of rooms being
used for the dates of out
of tewn friends.

‘Mrs. Nicholls stated there

were enough places for
dates in the surrounding
community, and advocated

use of these facilities alone
and leaving the men in their
dorms. Concommitant with
moving the men out is add-
ed security risks, which
Mrs. Nicholls sees as a
growing problem.

Hirst and Burney ‘favor
spending ,the money present-
ly used for big weekends on
a series of -concert week-
ends to supplement the
Artist series and the UCH.

dence, however, of drugs or
theft, I report it immediate-
ly to Mrs. Nicholls.”

Penley is confident that a
relationship of good faith
exists between the employes
and the students and is
proud that there have never
been any complaints against
the maintenance work he
has performed.

“Tam here to see that the
janitors do their job and
the students do theirs. «This

* is my job.”’

Complaints continue to be
registered, however, and
Mrs. Peter Nicholls, Direc-
tor of Student Housing, has
handled most of the accusa-
tions which are aimed at the
campus employes.

The contention of some,
students is that a few of the
janitors take advantage of
their ready access to rooms
and often “‘case the joint’
