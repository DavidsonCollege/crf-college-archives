The Honor Council met Mon-
day, January 14, to determine
punishment for junior James J.
Carswell IV, who had turned
himself in for accidentally pull-
ing'a fire alarm.

At approximately 2:30 on the
morning of Wednesday January
9, Carswell set off the fire alarm
on the second floor of Knox dor-
mitory. Later that day, Carswell
turned himself in to Director of
Residence Life, Richard Terry.

Terry referred the case over
to Dean of Students Will Terry
with whom Carswell met that af-
ternoon. After deliberating for
two days, Dean Terry directed
the case to the Honor Council.

During the open hearing,
Carswell stated his testimony that
he set off the alarm accidentally.
Carswell later said in an inter-
view after the hearing that what
happened was a “‘stupid mistake.
I had no malicious intentions

whatsoever. It was a complete ac-
cident.”

Also providing testimony to the
Honor Council was Fire Marshall
Bob Gurley.

Gurley stated that the false alarm

roused twenty two volunteer fire-
men from their beds and unneces-
sarily brought four fire trucks to
the campus ata total costof $420 to
the fire department.
Gurley ‘also emphasized that be-
cause of false alarms, less firemen
now respond to alarmsat Davidson
unless summoned by a second call
from the Fire Marshall.

Of paramount importance to
Gurley was that the false alarms
will stop, but that students won’t
be afraid to pull an alarm in the
case of an actual emergency. “We
want to stress to all the students:
do pull it when there is a need for
it,” said Gurley.

Gurley affirmed that it was
possible that the alarm could have
gone off accidentally. He stated

For Fire Alarm Offense

that the fire department “sug-
gested to Mr. Collins to put plas-
tic coversovert the alarms ... and
that would stop.a lot of these ac-
cidents.” Gurley also read a tet-
ter of apology which Carswell
had sent to him, and he accepted
on behalf of the department.

The Honor Council ruled that
Carswell must pay a $100 fine
and provide 32 hours of commu-
nity service. :

Although Carswell had been
drinking before the incident, no
alcohol probation or counselling
was recommended due to the ac-
cidental nature of the event.

Carswell’s comments on the
case were brief. “It is good that
it came out in public,” claims
Carswell, “because this is a prob-
lem of which the student body
needs to be aware.

"In a strange way, I’m glad
that it happened so that people
will know to stay the hell away
from fire alarms”.

the county had significant growth

Developers recognize the poten-

growing area. The Comelius Pizza

time record in sales for any Pizza

The movie theater is only part
of a project planned by Liverpool
Partnership Ltd. A complex in the
Chartwell Center area of Comelius
will include in addition to the cin-
ema, a First Citizens Bank, a 77
room Best Wester hotel and a
Pizza Hut which was completed in
December.

Although buiding permits were
issued last week, foul weather
hinders the start of construction.
Much of the infastructure for the
complex was completed earlier.
Developers hope they will com-
plete all of the project by late July.

This Liverpool Partnership
Ltd. complex epitomizes the sub-

community recognize both the
benifits and the drawbacks of such
rapid growth in the area. Charlotte
native and Davidson freshman
Phiderika Foust predicts that people
returning to north Mecklenburg
county five or six years from now
will not recognize the area.

Bill Strong who has resided in
Davidson for the past twenty-five
years and teaches at the middle
school in Huntersville has mixed
emotions.

“Although I would prefer a
rural environment,” says Strong,
“if we have to have the crowds, I
am delighted with the increased
convenience.”
