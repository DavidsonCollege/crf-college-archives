Exchange
Program
Discussed

Will Jackson presented the
possibility of participating in a
Student exchange program with
Amherst College to the Student
Council at the council's weekly
meeting Monday night.

Jackson called the program
**a sort of cultural exchange” in

which eight Davidson students
would travel to Amherst over
spring vacation next semester
and visit for several days, at-
tending classes, examining stud-
ent life in general. and perhaps
borrowing ideas from Ambherst
campus life to use at this school.
Likewise, eight Ambherst men
would come to Davidson over
their spring vacations for the
same purpose.

Transportation to the host col-
lege would be paid by the stud-
ent ‘himself, while the host
would feed and lodge the visit-
ing student.

Jackson asked that any mem-
ber of the student body inter-
ested in participating in this
program see him as soon as
possible for further details.

The council voted to grant a
$20 subsidy to Ken Childs, Dav-
idson delegate to the Student
Conference on National Affairs.
with an assurance of 15, extra
dollars for a chapel program
to be given by the delegate up-
on his return. This thirty-five
dollars would pay about half of|
the cost of the trip. The confer-
ence will be concerned with the
Latin American situation.

Tommy Heffner was the only
council memyver not present at
the meeting.

Braine Talks On English Novel

By HEYWARD CARTER

Davidsonian Feature Writer

The well-known English
novelist John Braine, au-
thor of Room at the Top,
chosen as YMCA book of

the semester, recently vis-
ited the Davidson campus.
While here Braine gave a
series of talks and discus-
sions on “Contemporary
Novelists in Britain,’ or as
he put it,” a very non-aca-
jJemic, general discussion
about my generation of
Snelish novelists.”

In chapel he dealt with con-
temporary literature as a whole.
and with only a few specific
cases. In England, according
to Braine. writers have no sense
of togetherness whatsoever.
There are no literary move-
ments or real trends as such —
each author writes what and as

he feels he should, regardless
of the success of anyone else
in any other style.

It could even be said that,
“AN English writers are anar-
chists,"’ because not only do

they not follow each other. but
“they do not meet their fellow
writers very often. As a matter
of fact, they don't even meet
their fellow human-beings very
often.” .

In the 35-year period from
1918 through 1953, the English.
nove! took a decided turn for
the worse. They were general-
ly set in London and the hero
was almost always from the
middle or upper classes, with
a private income. This not only
gets repetitious, but, according
to Braine, it is also very un-
realistic because the number of
middle class people having a
private income is almost nil.

Another point seen in most
novels of this period is that the
hero is nearly always defeated
at the end of the story. This
defeat was not even a glorious
one. but instead a rather ignom-
inous one —' “‘a defeat in a
muted key.’ Because ot this the
protagonist came to be known
as a ‘“‘wet hero, and the really
wet ones were known as drips.”

At this point Braine hastened
to make it clear that not all
novels of this time were worth-
less, in fact there were some
very good ones, but as a rule
most of them limited them-

. Selves too much to be of any

value.

This was very different from
the American novel which,
“though it often suffers from a
lack of taste and an addiction
to rhetoric." shows tremendous
vitality — at times too muca
vitality. The English instead
showed far too little vitality.”

In commenting on England's
“angry young men movement”
as it has been called, Braine
tagged it purely a journalistic.

ary movements in England. Any
oine who has had a book pub-
lished since 1953 is now termed
an angry young man by such
uninformed critics as Leslie
Feidler (“the genius who dis-
covered Huckleberry Finn was
homosexual”). .
Braine did, however, specifi-
cally mention three men who did

Amis, who started the ball roll-

ing with his novel. Lucky Jim.
not only shocked the literary
world by setting his novel in a
‘university other than Oxford or
Cambridge. but his protagonist
even wins a resounding victory
in the end.

Braine himself was another
leader in breaking away from
the old mode of writing, with
his Room at The Top. This was
the first novel set outside of
London without a Northern
background which was actually
taken seriously. The hero, from
the working classes, is not, as
is usual, concerned for the plight
of the working classes, but
rather for his own plight in es-
caping from his class.

his Sporting Life, breaks the

el about the condition of the
working class. Rather, it show-

question of whether he thought
the film should or would get the

Rhodes Relates Results
Of Ecumenical Council

By DICK CANNING
Davidsonian Feature Writer

It seems strange for us at Davidson to be
talking about the Roman Catholic Church and
the ecumenical movement when our own li-
brary doesn’t have enough books on the sub-
ject for a good research paper.

But talk we do. and at last Wednesday
night's “Open End" the talking was as educa-
tional and interesting as a book could have
been, with Dr. D. D. Rhodes doing most of the
talking.

Prefacing the body of his talk with a bit
of historical. background, Rhodes spoke brief-
ly regarding the Council of Trent, which met
at various intervals from 1545 to 1563. The
present council, he stated, is the first
major one since Trent, which has determined
Church doctrine for over 400 years.

Contrasting the two councils. Rhodes
noted that the Counci) of Trent was composed
of a maximum of 253 people. two-thirds of
whom were Italian, while the present council
includes about three thousand people from
all over the world.

GET AT A DIALOGUE

In addition, Rhodes noted that the older
council provided a sharp dividing line be-
tween Catholic and Protestant churches,
while the one now meeting has as its purpose
“to get a dialogue going between Catholics
and non-Catholics.”

Rhodes then proceeded to discuss the
major problems facing the present council.
The first of these. he said, is that of tradi-
tional] liturgy. He pointed out, however, that
the major step has aiready been taken in this
direction, with the translation of the Mass
into the languages of the various areas in
which it is used.

MAJOR STEP

A major step has also been taken, pointed

out Rhodes, in field of the Church hierarchy,

where the bishops from all over the world
have been elevated to a position almost on a
par with that of the Pope. The final area in
which a major step has been accomplished is
the relationship of the Roman Church to the
Jews.

The attitude of the Church in the past.
asserted Rhodes, has been one of. condemna-
tion of the Jews as a peopie for the Crucific-
tion. Said Rhodes, “But this is not the offi-
cial stand of the Church at all, and the
Council has made that clear.”

Continuing to practical problems faced
by the Council, Dr. Rhodes first took up a
little known but. quite interesting problem,
that of a common Biblical text for Catholics
and Protestants. He informed his audience
that a friend of his. a priest, had told him
that any such text would be very like the
Revised Standard Version, now used by many
Protestant denominations. Hé commented,
“This would be a real first. if such a thing
could be done.

BIRTH CONTROL

The last two major problems Rhodes con-
sidered on the Council's agenda are those of
birth control and marriage and of religious
freedom. The questions here are vague, and
the problems have not yet been specifically
defined, but Rhodes pointed out. that ‘the
questions have been raised. It’s the kind of
question the Church hasn't talked about for
years, hundreds of years!”

In conclusion, Rhodes commented on the
effect of all the changes on the Roman Catho-
lic laity: ‘They are bewildered and uncertain.
The Church has always been the place of re-
fuge .. . of certainty . .. the place where
truth is given,”

These changes, though bewildering, are
designed, stated ‘Rhodes, to bring Catholics
and non-Catholics into a closer relationship
with one another as Christian brothers.

dence.

The author of a number of
publications, the professor is
now attempting to complete a
projected five-volume biography
of Thomas Jefferson. The first
three volumes include Jeffer-
son the Virginian. Jefferson and
the Rights of Man, and Jeffer-
son and the Ordeal of Liberty.

Phi Beta Kappa’s Visiting
Scholar Program was begun in
1956 to enable more schools to
have leading scholars partici-.
pate in campus activities.

Under the sponsorship of the
United Chapters of Phi Beta
Kappa. a scholar spends two or
three days on campus. General-
ly. a visiting scholar gives a
public lecture, leads classroom
discussion, and meets informal-
ly with the students and faculty.

Faculty To
Focus On
Proposals

The faculty, focusing on
the drinking situation, will
discuss and possibly act on
the drinking sétuation at
its monthly meeting Tues-
day, reports President D.
Grier Martin.

“This is not a new question,
There has been drinking at Dav-
idson for a Jong time, but there
seems to have been an increase
lately." explained Martin.

At the group’s last meeting
on Nov. 10, two possible solu-
tions to the problem were sub-
mitted. One ‘suggestion was
proposed by Will Jackson, Fred
Sackett. and Charlie Dibble, as
representatives of the student
body. The second measure was
put forward by the Executive
Committee of the faculty.

No vote was taken on either
proposal at the November meet
ing. and they were both tabled
until this month's meeting. It
was felt that faculty members
needed more time to think
about these measures and to dis-
cuss them informally,

At the Nov. 10 meeting. Jack-
son, Sackett, and Dibble present-
ed a poll taken by the Student
Council! through the fraternities.
The poll indicated that 81 per
cent of the student body drink,
70 per cent have kept alcohol

| on Campus, and 36 per cent have

kept alcoholic beverages
the dorms.

The Office of the Dean of Stud-
ents is now polling 20 per cent
of the student body to deter.
mine prevalent student opinion.
Questions deal with aspects of
the student body and faculty
rules on drinking. Results of
the poll! will be presented at the
meeting Tuesday.
