The 1973-74 Wildcats started
the season on the right foot
Monday with a convincing 111-
66 win over Wofford.

“I thought we played well,
everybody came in and
scored,’’ said head coach
Terry Holland.

The Cats were paced by
senior John Falconi who had
19 points for the night. Falconi
also led the team in assists
with five. Other players
scoring in double figures were
Greg Dunn and Tom Verlin
with 13 pts. and Larry
Horowitz with 11 pts.

Verlin, in just his second
varsity game, was 5 for 5 from
the floor and made 3 for 3 foul

game.
The Cats only problem
seemed to be overeagerness
on defense.

“‘We played good team
defense, very aggresive," said
Holland

He went on to explain he
was that when several
starters got into early foul
trouble, their backups were
able to come in and play well.

“We need a team where

can come off the bench

and.do.a- good .jeb,’’ Holland.

stated.

Impressive backup per-
formances were turned in by
Verlin, Eppa Rixey who led
the game in rebounding, and
by T.J. Pecorak.

Pecorak, seeing his first ac-
tion of the season after pulling
a hamstring last month, came
off the bench to score nine
points and play very solid de-
fense.

Last night, the Cats pulled
out a convincing 103-84 victory
over Brown.

Before the game, Holland
felt that it would be one of the
season's key games.

“I felt we played very well,
especially after we went into
the zone during the first half; '

several adjustments were
made, including the switch to
a zone defense. Davidson put

called for goaltending.

“It was a bad call, but I'm
still kind of glad to have us
finally get called for goalten-
ding,’’ said Holland.

Wagner did an excellent job
of neutralizing the Bruin’s
highly touted Phil Brown and
led the team in rebounding.

NCAA Finals.

East Carolina, on the other
hand, is not expected to
challenge the two perennial
contenders, Furman and
Davidson, for either of the two
titles. The Pirates are in some
sort of a rebuilding campaign.

Last season ECU finished
with a 13-13 record, good
enough for third in the con-
ference. Their upset win over
Furman paved the way for
Davidson's regular season
crown.

The Pirates, however, were
hit hard by graduation. They
lost six of their top eight per
formers.

But head coach Tom Quinn
is not in a state of dispair, in
spite of the impending crisis.
He recruited three hot

new faces, the East Carolina

has accepted the role of
leader, according to Quinn
and should prove to be in-
valuable in coordinating the
efforts of the club.

Last season, White averaged
11.1 points per game and
hauled in quite a few rebounds
for the Pirates.

One of the new faces that
will see extensive action is
freshman Larry Hunt. The
6-8 rookie will be used pri-
marily when Quinn seeks to
employ the double-post forma-
tion on offense.

The other strong point for
the Pirates is at the
point. In his first year in
college, Donnie Hunt is a 6-1
guard, who has been termed a
“‘smoothie”’ for his ball han-
dling skills. Junior Ken Ed-
monds is also 6-1. He will push
Owens hard at the point guard
position.
