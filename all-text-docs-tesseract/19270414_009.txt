DYNAMIC “DROOPY” HUDGINS

Droop, Son of Hudgins, Realizes Ambition
Cherished by Him Since Childhood Days

“Some are born great, some achieve

greatness, and some _ have

thrust upon them,” but never before in

the history of Davidson College College
as there been one man listed among the
ranks of the students who stood out head
and shoulders above the rest, as does

Frank Esquidge Hudgins, Jr., who may |
be said to be the outstanding representa- |
tive of that fair metropolis, Bluefield, W.

Va. Never before has there been ‘one
who might be given the title of “great”
or even “near-great” until this bright
Easter Season. Never before has there
been one who was not o6nly born great,
but also achieved more greatness
even then had some more greatness
thrust upon him.

The answer to this |
problem as to why all this, is not hidden |
behind a veil of intangible darkness but |

is evident to the least observant—DROOP
HAS “IT!”

Droop has been chosen the May King
of fair Davidson and rightly so, for never
has there been: a more magnanimous
spirit sent out from the bounds of that
land of blue grass, bootleggers and black-
smiths. Such an honor as has been be-
stowed upon the delicate brow of that
droopy one, comes not as a surprise to

those beloved ones of the honored one
for ever since his first ery, ever since his
very first breath was taken there has been

|gladness and pollity in the land because

of the arising of one of the most noble
expounders and exemplifiers of “IT” in
the history of human progress.
To think that Droop has realized a
life-long ambition is but to trace the de-

You can learn far more about Tospacco
from old Prof. Pipe, than you'll get by
studying every treatise ever written on it.
For Prof. Pipe is the world’s most eminent
authority on the subject... He knows
tobacco from plant to pipe!

Experiments with every known species
have convinced the Prof. that the one
perfect pipe tobacco is Granger Rough
Cut... He points out reasons for this
conclusion: (G) the Granger-grade Burley,
the choicest tobacco grown; (Rr) the Re-dis
covery of Wellman’s mellowing method;
and (c) the Cut of the large slow-burning

Prof. Pipe proves Granger, by practical
demonstration—shows how it acts under
fire... You never saw tobacco burn so
slow, never tasted such cool, mild mellow-
ness! The first pipeful is a liberal education!
You'll put your Q.£. p. and capital 0. x. on
G.R.C. ..and all your pipe problems will
be solved. . . forever!”
