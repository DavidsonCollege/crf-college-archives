Economics And Politics
Fine Course At Oxford

By Phillip W. Buck
Assistant Professor of Government,
Mills College, California, Rhodes
Scholar from Idaho to Wadham Col-
lege, Oxford 1923-1926

It will be some time yet before Ox-

ford establishes an Honors School of |

Business Administration. Any Ameri-
can who goes there in search of train-
ing in the Technique of Advertising, or
the Management of Retail Credit, will
find no one to recognize those sub-
jects, much less to teach them to him.
But if any American goes there to
study the economic and political as-
pects of this modern society, he will
find those subjects being deeply con-
sidered, actively, even furiously dis-
cussed, and ably taught.

The student who wishes to study
economics and politics for this pur-
pose—namely, to try to understand the
political and economic phenomena of
this present confusing world — has
urgent and fundamental need of at
least three things: Libraries, that is.
formal material to-work with; associa-
tion with competent men actively in-
terested in such investigation; and ay
sufficient proximity to the actual,
functioning political and economic
structure which he wishes to investi-
gate. The American Rhodes Scholar
finds all three at Oxford.

He is most likely to be dissatisfied, I
believe, with the first item—the li-
braries. Accustomed to the inhuman
perfection of library technique in his
own university, where he often hadj{
merely to present the magic symbols
of a card catalogue index number to
have the book come sliding down a
chute to him with almost incredible
promptness, he finds that fumbling in
a college or university library at Ox-
ford is fearfully annoying. But the
Oxford Libraries, to offset their inef-
ficency, possess the very great ad-
vantage of informality—except, of
course, the Bodleian and the Radcliffe
Camera. In the Brand Library of the
Codrington in All Souls College, in the
pleasant rooms of the Barnett House
Library, in the library at the Union, in
his own college library, he has the ex-
perience which has frequently been
denied him, of finding the books him-

“self on the shelves; and though he fre-
quently doesn’t find precisely what he
wants, he often inadvertently finds
things he would never have discovered
otherwise. In any case, these libraries
are not merely adequately, but well
stocked with the books and periodicals
he needs.

He can scarcely be dissatisfied with
the way his second need is met—the
men he is associated with in his
studies, both faculty and students, are
not merely competent, but stimulating.
Tutors in economics and politics at
Oxford in Oxford colleges are usually
young (because the School of “Mod-
ern Greats” is a new one), interested,
and—what is more important still—ac-
quainted with other fields of knowl-
edge than their own particular spe-
cialty, philosophy, history, ethics.
Further,the student reading the Hon-
or School of Philosophy, Politics, and
Economics, is at present sent to a num-
ber of ‘men in various colleges, and
this is a real advantage; he may have
some bad tutors; but may also count
on having some very good ones. The
lecturers he hears are men of real
eminence; some names—D, H. Mac-
gregor, A. D. Lindsay (Master of Bal-
liol), G. D. H. Cole, W. G. S. Adams,
E. M. Lipson—will affirm this.

Finally, he has the opporttiityof
coming into contact with(the actual
phenomena he is learning kbout. Ox-
ford itself is cosmopolitan—he may
have first hand accounts of British In-
dian administration, French politics, in-

ternational finance industrial
the good fortune to meet.
in reach of “The Heart of the Em-

pire” in London, the French and Ger-

man parliaments, the Paris Bourse, or

|Lombard Street. These things in-
levitably impinge upon him in the pa-
'pers he reads; he meets Socialists,
'Anarchists, Syndicalists. He need not
be observant to learn things; or even
intelligent—it is enough to be concious!

“But this is all very abstract,” says
the prospective student, Rhodes
Scholar or otherwise, “what do I do,
exactly, when I get there?” The ans-
wer to that question involves a brief
description of the academic opportu-
nities that are open to him. He may
“read for”—“register in” is a reason-

jably accurate translation—the Hon-

ors School of Philosophy, Politics, and
Economics which has already been
mentioned. Here he works for two or
three years on such subjects as these:
History of Philosophy, Moral and
Political Philosophy, Eeonomic and
Political Organization, British Con-
stitutional and Political History, British
Social and Economic History, Eco-
nomic T hery, certain classics
of economic and political
writing, two foreign languages. This
is not a complete list; but it shows the
sort of thing he does, Further, he ar-
ranges these subjects in the order of
his interest; he may concentrate on

ophy, and do a special subject in that
field. But he must learn something of
all of them, and establish the relation-
ships between them.” In the second
place, he may spend a year or two in
taking a Diploma in Economics and
Political Science, a similar course,
more limited in extent. In either case
the degree or the diploma is granted
after what we Americans call a com-
prehensive examination—a_ gruelling
and valuable experience.

If he already has graduate standing
in his home university, he may do re-
search work, and supplicate for either
the degree of B. Litt. or D. Phil.

To come back, at last, to what was
said at first: if a man wishes to ac-
quire a specialized skill in some techni-
cal field of business or public admin-
istration, Oxford has little to offer him;
but if his object is, to quote from the
Statutes of the University, “the study
of the structure, ahd the philosophical,
political, and economic principles, of
Modern Society” Oxford offers him
truly great opportunities.

danger of being mistaken for a gathering

The Davidson ’Cats are in fine fettle.
Most of the injuries resulting from their
pre-championship games having healed,
the entire squad will be available to
Monk's call. With the rancor of fast
year’s galling defeat in their heart®} along
with the determination to stage a corne-
back, they bid fair to keep State’s hands
rather full. Monk and Tex, white main-
taining the well-known pessimism, both
wore mysterious smiles when interviewed.
And, by the way, Harry Griffin, the Ot-
server's dope-fiend, hints that this year’s
all-State lists may contain a four letter
word, beginning with K and meaning Inb-
ricated lightning.

The team will leave Saturday morning
about 8:00 o'clock, and around 30 men
will be carried. In its wake all good Da-
vidsonians will trail. Headquarters for
the Red and Black in Greensboro during
the morning and afternoon will be the
Hotel King Cotton. 4

ALUMNI SECRETARY

(Continued from page 1) :
voted to homecoming day, when practi-

cally a dozen states will be represented by
men from approximately all of the classes
from 1870 through 1928, with the excep-
tion of about ten. Plans for homecoming
include a broadcast of a Davidson pro-
gram over Station WBT on the night of
November 13.

Heretofore the alumni news has been
handled through “The Davidsonan,” and
due to the fact that many alumni do not
get The Davidsonian, they have lost all
track of their fellow classmates and the
college. This alumni paper was founded
to offset this, it being thought that the
alumni would pay more attention to a
special alumni paper than to The David-
sonian. The editor of the “Davidson
Alumnus” is the alumni secretary, Ern-
est Milton. Milton during the years that
he has been here has done much to pro-
mote the alumni work. He has secured
the names and addresses of many alumni
and ex-men of whom all record had been
lost.

One feature of the paper is the vital
statistics corner. This is located on the
last page of the paper, and contains all
of the recent available gecords of births,
deaths, engagements, and marriages of
alumni.

The mailing list in the alumni office at
the present time totals 3.741 names, with
the possibility of more than 150 other
alumni names being added during the year.
Several hundred men were traced during
the past summer months. It is estimated
that if all of the former students now liv-
ing could be located, the list would total
approximately 4,100 names. This serves
to show the task awaiting the alumni sec-
retary when he starts to mail out the
alumni paper to the many graduates.

Juniors Outstanding
In First Track Meet

Run Up 661, Points to Score
Victory

On Friday, November 1, the first fall
track meet ever held at Davidson took
place, with the Junior class copping
first honors with a total score of 66
and 1-2 points. They were followed by
the Seniors with 40 1-2 points, the
Freshmen, with 33 points, and the
Sophomores with 19 points, Although
no records were officially broken, some
of the times and marks were surpris-
ingly good for this season of the year,
as no pledge was required of any track
candidates.

The performance of Whittle in the
high hurdles was probably the out-
standing feat of the afternon. He
negotiated the necessary distance in
the fast time of 15 and 2-5 seconds.
Since the watches of the timers were
not exactly the same, the average of
three watches was taken. In the
javelin throw, Herman King of the
Junior class outstripped his competi-
tors with a distance of 153 feet and 3
inches. Captain Bailey was not forced
above 10 feet in the pole vault. The
hundred yard dash was won by Whit-

tle in the excellent time of 10 1-5
seconds. Dumas won the high jump
at 5 feet 11 inches.

It seems that the men participating
in the meet was so versatile in their
events, that the high point honors were
claimed by no less than four men.
These jack-of-all-trades are, Lafferty,
Whittle, and Gardner, all of the Junior
class, and Lillard of the Freshman
class. These men turned in scores of
10 points each. King, of the Junior
class was close on their heels with a
total of 9 points, and was in turn fol-
lowed closely by Jennings of the Sen-
ior class who boosted the total score of
the Seniors 8 points. The relay race,
which was run between the halves of
the Wildkitten-Blue Im game on Fri-
day, was also won by the Juniors. The
