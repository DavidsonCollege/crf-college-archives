LUNCHEON AT GLENDALE AIR
PORT ENJOYABLE FEATURE

By JACK WILLIAMS, Jr.

Leaving Santa Barbara we arrived in Los
Angeles three hours later and attended a
banquet piven at the Alexandria Hotel which
was convention headquarters. Hon, Friend
W. Richardson, former Governor of Cali-
fornia_and President of the California Press
Association, made the address of welcome.
He travelled with the party the whole time
it remained on California soil.

Another speaker was Hon. John C. Porter,
Mayor of Los Angeles. He is a fine looking
man and. his charming wife made an ap-
pointment for me to visit him the next
morning to be shown over the new City
Hall, Others present were Hon. A. Schleich-
President of the Los Angeles Chamber
of Commerce, and Harry Chandler, Past
President. of the American Publishers As-
sociation and publisher of the Los. Angeles
Times. An-unusually good speech was made
by .the Lieutenant Governor of California,
Hon. Frank F. Merriam.

There were many conventions in Los An-
geles at this time and all of them claimed
Vice-President Curtis. Everywhere he went
he was feted and loudly acclaimed on every
side. California said it was a pleasure and
a privilege to be host to the Vice-President
of-the—United, States. Marie Dressler was
once called.on to speak at a banquet given
at the Alexandria after some of the speak-
ers had. praised him and explained how for-
tunate they were to have him there. When
it came Marie’s turn she put her hand on
the top of -the Vice-President’s bald head
and said, “Charles, I’ve been listening to all
that’s been said, but I think you’re—lucky
to be here!”

session in San Fransisco.
DR. HENRY NASH SPEAKS ON, PRINT-
ING

Dr. Nash is one of the greatest printers
known and at the session in San Francisco
told about printing the life of Mrs. Phoebe
Hearst for Mr. Hearst. He brought a copy
of the book’ with him, with several others,
including his masterpiece, Dante.

This gteat printer set the type for Mr.
Hearst's book with his own hands. Sim-
plicity is the keyriote and the paper is of
the finest white German vellum, Dr. Nash
told me that he never hurries when print-
ing a book. -When Mr. Hearst told Dr, Nash
exactly when he wanted his book, the latter
replied that if he wanted him to edit the
book he was not to give any directions. Mr.
Hearst let him alone.

After a period of years Dr. Nash finished
the book and Mr. Hearst asked him how
much-it would be. Dr. Nash, with fear and
trembling, whispered, “Ten thousand dol-
lars.” Mr. Hearst went for a walk-in the
garden and on returning, commented, “I’m
disappointed. I thought it would cost me at
least fifteen thousand.” Dr, Nash later print-
ed a copy of Dante for Mr. Hearst, and need-
less to say it cost Mr. Hearst exactly fifteen
thousand dollars.

At the business session the next morning
we heard Mr. Crombie Allen, of Ontario,
Canada, speak on ‘Russia and American
Journalism.”-Unlike many so-called “authori-
ties’ who go over for a week or two and
return to write.a book on Russia, Mr. Allen

a lapse of three years bécause he had been
furnished with a new rope to replace the
that rotted in 1929. He used the rope
to gain entrance to his lofty perch.

“Tarzan” is Orrin Sternbarger, 75, former
instructor in art at Wittenberg College.
Eighteen years ago doctors told him he
would die within a few months from tuber-
culosis.

The instructor decided that he would spend
his last few months close to the nature he
loved. So he entered the wooded area near

with only a fishpole and a bow and arrow
to aid him in getting food.

Recently a resident of this city learned of
the old man’s lack of approach to his hut,
and bought him a new one.

The new ‘rope arrived this week. Stern-
barger fastened a thread to an arrow and
sent it over a limb near his hut. Then he

come lounge lizards,” Dr. Frank Parker Day
of Union College told the Freshman class
at that college last week.

“Character,” he said, “is necessary if one
is -to-decide-on-a line-ofaction and have
the courage to follow it through. It is far
better to become a waster and do a good
job of it than to try to accomplish something
and slip into wastefulness.”

Berkeley, Cal—(IP)—Professor E. O.
Lawrence, head of the University of Cali-
fornia fadiation laboratory, last week an-
nounced that-his department had succeeded
in disintegrating the lithium atom into two
alpha particles, ‘or iottized atoms of helium
gas.

He explained that a lythium fluoride was
bombarded with a stream of proton bullets.
The number of disintegrated atoms increased
as the energy of the “bullets” was increased
to 510,000 volt-electrons.

San Francisco—(IP)—Brought before Mu-
nicipal Judge Sylvian J. Lazarus here on a
charge of taking two books on philosophy
from a book store recently,, Harold Lord,
23, Northwestern University student, ex-
plained to the judge that he was hungry,
for both food and greater knowledge.

For three-quarters of an hour there was
a keen philosophical discussion between the
student and the judge, which ended when

the judge said that “this boy is no criminal.

He is a smart lad.”

Judge Lazarus then gave him a suspended
15-day sentence and handed him $1, “so*you
won't have to go hungry, my-Jad.”
