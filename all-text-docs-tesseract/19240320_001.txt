“But the fraternities feel that it is their

week-end party is just one of the plans in

Youthful Jollity Pervades Atmosphere of Queen
City As Sophs Celebrate With Jovial Banquet

Much joy was spread by the joyoys Sophs
in their annual banquet given at the Char-
lotte Chamber of Commerce hall, last Thurs-
day night. A program of mirth and jollity
arranged by the committee appointed by the
class was carried out to the letter, and with
the addition of several impromptu speeches
of diverse nature, not to mention the
licious menu, the evening was spent in one
of the most enjoyable social gatherings of
the year. —

Nearly a hundred men journeyed to Char-
lotte late Thursday afternoon and by 7:00
o'clock the entire body had congregated at
the spacious dining hall of the Chamber of
Commerce building where a festive spirit
was evident in the air, as well as in the
decorations of spring blossoms, and purple
and gold, the class colors, on the banquet
tables. A fraternal spirit manifested itself
during the course of the banquet, inter-
spersed with much youthful hilarity and
good will from everyone. Class friendship,
loyalty to '26, and retrospect and introspect
of their college life were the predominant

de-

notes of the ie who were representa- president of the Freshman class, was along,

tive of the class. Mr. F. L.
H. B. Arbuckle, Albert
Elkins, Chong McIlwaine,
tian were especially
Sophomores.

Tom Baker was the toastmaster, and did
his part with all grace and deftness of execu-
tion, although his august presence was de-
layed to the extent of some half an hour, and
E. K. Regen was elected toastmaster pro
tempore. After the main course of the eat-
ables was well under way, Peter Bost was
called upon to expres his views of everything
in particular, his remarks eliciting applause
from all present. Liston Elkins, editor of
the Davidsonian, was next fired at, and when
he arose silence reigned: He made a happy
talk of humor and advice to all prospective
Juniors, and he, too, was unproarously re-
ceived. “Chong” McIJwaine and Albert M.
Hillhouse made short and snappy speeches
in which they expressed their,.appreciation
of the honor given them of attending this

and he voiced*his sentiments of
time he was having, in no uncertain tones.
W. E. Milton, the class historian, gave
resume of the history of the class since
first advent onto the campus of Davidson.

Following these speeches, toasts were given
by several members of the class. “To Da-
vidson” was given by Hayden Hollingsworth,
in which he gave an inspirational thought to
all loyal sons of this college. To the “Fac-
ulty,” by C. FE, Houston, brought forth in
a humorous manner new ideas regarding this
body who direct the affairs of Davidson men,
H. L. “Buck” Shaw made every one of the
class members present thrill with pride, with
his toast to “'26.” “Looking Forward,” by
Hampden Lawson, and ‘Looking Backward,”
by E. P. O'Connor, gave opposite views as to
the progress of the class, and both were well
to the point. Forrest Franklin entertairied
| the diners with his “Qui Vive,” which
brought forth more guffaws.

Bruce Curry Conducts

Fifty students had the privilege of attend-

he has the ability to put things across.
