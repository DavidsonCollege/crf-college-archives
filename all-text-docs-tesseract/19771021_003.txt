Mellon grant funds
faculty programs

The Humanities Program,
the Center for Special Studies,
the Drama and _ Speech De-
partment, the Physics Depart-
ment, and the Economics De-
partment have benefited from
a $200,000 grant from the
Andrew W. Mellon Founda-
tion.

Davidson received this mo-
ney in July, 1976. According
to the official request the
money is being used for ‘‘the
enrichment of the academic
program through incentives to
faculty renewal and stimuli to
the intellectual vitality of the
campus community.”

Dean of the Center for
Special Studies, Dr. Robert L.
Avinger said that the Center is
using the Mellon Grant to
provide ‘‘faculty department
and training to better be able
to teach and guide research.”

This summer with money
from the grant the Center
sponsored a workshop on Am-
erican Studies for faculty
members. This workshop in-
cluded visiting lecturers and a
final week spent at Emory
University in Atlanta study-
ing American urbanization.

The Drama and Speech De-
partment is using the Mellon
Grant to implement a three-
year pilot program through
the Center for Special Studies

in Dramatic Literature and
Theatre. Currently six stu-
dents are involved in the
program.

Associate Professor of
Drama and Speech Dr. Rupert
T. Barber, Jr., hopes that the
program ‘‘will grow enough to
justify being continued.’ Bar-
ber went on to add that such a
program would not be possible
if it were not for the grant.

The Physics Department
has used money from the
grant to study departmental
curriculum and to conduct
experiments in cryogenics
(temperature research).

Vice President of Academic
Aftairs C. Price Zimmerman
feels that the grant money has
added significantly to the
intellectual life of the college.
He specifically cited the use of
outside examinets such as in
the Economics Department.
These examiners analyzed de-
partmental procedures. Zim-
merman said that the exam-
iners were of ‘‘joint benefit to
the students and faculty’ and
served for the faculty as a
“plumb line to judge its own
efforts.”’

Future plans for the grant
money include an interdiscip-
linary seminar to be held
August 6 to August 31, 1978
offered by the Philosophy
Department on science, tech-
nology, and human values.

The Davidsonian recently
conducted an informal survey
to determine faculty opinion
on the matter of the academic
calendar.

The question put to the
faculty was: Do you prefer the
semester system or the pres-
ent system for the calendar
year?

Vice President for Academic
Affairs Price Zimmerman re-
fused to indicate a preference
for one system over the other
and said that his office was
prepared to administer eithe
system.

He did, however, discuss
some of the advantages inher-
ent in each system.

The semester system is
easier for everyone to admini-
strate, according to Zimmer-
man, because there are only
two registration periods so
there is one-third less paper

work for everyone—students,_

faculty, and administration.
He also pointed out that the
semester system works-to the
advantage of faculty for sab-
baticals because they would
get a longer period of time and
also because more colleges and
universities are presently on
the semester system.
Zimmerman also felt that
the semester system gave

students more time to absorb
material than is presently
available under the ten-week
term system.

He was quick, however, to
point out advantages in the
present system.

It is possible to offer a wider
variety of courses under this
system.

Departments can offer more
specific courses and students
realize that if they don’t get a
course fall term there is still a
chance to get it later in the
calendar year.

Zimmerman pointed out
that one big advantage of the
present system was the fact
that it was ‘already estab-
lished. The turnover process
would be complicated as well
as costly..

It must be emphasized that
there are two types of semes-
ter systems: the late semester
which begins in late Septem-
ber and ends in mid-January
and the early semester which
begins around mid-August
and ends before Christmas.

Davidson had the late sem-
ester system in effect in 1967
before the present calendar
was adopted. The main com-
plaint that faculty seem to
have about the old system was
the split fall term; students
left for Christmas and still had
to face exams shortly after
their return in January.

When the present calendar
was adopted it was hoped that
this split term would be elim-
inated. Complication with im-
plementing the three-term cal-
endar in the early years forced
the beginning of winter term
to be in early December which
again caused a split term.

Although several faculty
members expressed dismay
over this dilemma, Zimmer-
man does not see it as a
problem even though it does
have some disadvantages.

Zimmerman, is not im-

“pressed with the early semes-

ter plan because he thinks it is
wrong to try to force too many
things into the term, including

exams, in the mad rush to
finish before Christmas.

“All students need time to
benefit from the mere situa-
tion of being here,’’ explained
Zimmerman.

‘“There should be time for
having some fun. A semester
system when all is crowded for
a last push before Christmas
makes hectic a season of the.
year that should be enjoy-
able.”’

As the figures above indi-
cate the faculty was split in its
opinion as to which system, if
either, is best.

Almost all faculty members '
were quick to point out that
there was no perfect system
and many professed to see
advantages with both systems
and refused to choose.

Many of the faculty mem-
bers in favor of switching
claimed that the major draw-
back to the present system is a
lack of ‘‘percolation time’’ for
students to assimilate and
absorb material.

These individuals feel ‘that
students would gain more time
to better understand their
material because under the
semester system there usually
is a day between class ses-
sions,

Opponents of the change
reject this idea and insist that
most students will still pro-
crastinate and do their outside
work the night before it’s due.

There was almost unani-
mous opposition to resuming
Saturday classes, which had
been presént under the old
pre-1967 semester system
here.

Several faculty members re-
jected both our present system
and a semester system, These
professors advocate their own
systems which range from a
conventional 4-1-4 calendar
arrangement to a more compli-
cated system designed to cir-
cumvent the divided winter
term’ through a concentrated
three-week, one-unit course
followed by eight weeks of
study with two course credits.
