knows at first hand Davidsou’s available
base ball material, beth old and new.
is of the apinian that the prowess of the
“Red and Black Machine on the base
ball diamond ahis spring, will measure up
to that of former vette

limbering up preparatory to regular
spring practice which begins only a lit-
tle more than a month hence,

cerning the schedule which he cares to
reveal now is that Davidson will) not
