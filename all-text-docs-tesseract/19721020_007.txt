Politicians Switch, Profit By Youth Vote

By TOM BRUCE

As the new youth electorate
contemplates the coming
national elections. there has
been intentional distortion of
the exact means by which the 18
to 21-year-old population ac-
cepted its franchise.

Everyone from Edmund
Muskie to Strom Thurmond has
reminded his youth con-
stituencv to remember who was
responsible for the long-sought
emancipation.

Now that the 18-year-old vote
is a reality, almost all the can-
didates point with pride to their
support of the extension.

Back in the winter of 1970 the
youth vote was popular only
among the youth and a small
corps of congressmen.

Beginning with the opening
years of World War II every
United States Congress had
seen the introduction of one or
more proposed constitutional
amendments seeking to lower
the voting age.

Each of the last four presi-
dents endorsed the idea, but
somehow the vote never
materialized.

For a constitutional amend-
ment to become law, it must be
ratified by 38 of the 50 states.

this was anearly impossi -
die since only Pour states
(Alaska, Georgia, Hawaii and
Kentucky). could muster
enough support to warrant the
change.

Again and again state
legislatures rejected the amen-
dment, stalled it in committee.
or submitted it to the people by
referendum. The people
repeatedly rejected the motion,
angered by mounting youth
militance. ;

In 1970 Senator Edward Ken-
nedy came up with the idea of
enfranchising the young voters
through regular legislation. He
decided to include the youth suf-
ferage clause in the pending
renewal of the ‘‘Voting Rights
Act of 1965.""

Kennedy arranged for
Senator Mike Mansfield.
majority leader in the Senate to
introduce the entire package.
This effectively circumvented
intervention by the powerful
Judiciary Committee, chaired
by 82 year-old Rep. Emanuel
Cellars, an abject enemy of the
provision who had argued
against it for years.

Senators who would have
been reluctant to approve the
measure voted in favor of it,
since they could not afford to
disparage the ‘‘Voting Rights

Act” proper. President Richard
Nixon sought in vain to stop the
measure.

He suggested that it be sub-
mitted to the states for
ratification as a Constitutional
Amendment. Nixon wanted the
matter entrusted to the states
where it had already failed so
many times.

Kennedy pointed out that the
states might not have an op-
portunity to act on the matter
before the 1972 elections, then
two full years away.

The White House pressured
Republican senators and
representatives to vote against
the act so that it-could go the
Constitutional Convention rout.

The vote was 64-17 in favor of
the measure, with the hesitant
Republicans witholding their
votes until the Kennedy sup-
porters and party regulars had
already decided the matter.
Several senators then had their
votes ‘‘changed’’ before
publication of the Congressional
Record.

The week before the vote was
taken, a Gallup poll showed that
a cross-section of Americans
believed that student unrest
was the number one problem in
the United States.

Student unrest was more
serious, the poll showed, than

the Vietnam war, the economy,
or racial division.

Nixon signed the bill after a
full week of deliberation, poin-
ting out that the Supreme Court
would probably declare it un-
constitutional.

When asked if a test case was
planned, Nixon stated that he
favored the youth vote without
reservation.

He added that Attorney
General John Mitchell would
push for the matter to come
before the Supreme Court at an
early date.

On Dec. 21,1971, just 10 days
before the law was to take ef-
fect, the Supreme Court handed
down its 5-4 decision to permit
the 18-year-old vote in federal
races but not in state and local
races.

Chief Justice Warren Berger,
a Nixon appointee, wrote that
the 18-year-old vote was un-
constitutional in all regards.

In a footnote he stated that he
was personally in favor of the
vote, but desired to see it im-
plemented through ‘‘a Con-
stitutional Convention in the 50
states."

Now youth could legally vote
in federal elections for
President. Vice-President,
senators and members of the
House of Representatives.

Charges, Counter Charges Heat Night Air
As Debaters Toss Out Political Rhetoric

‘HUGH MOORE

Despite the lack of faculty
assistance, student Nixon
supporters eagerly debted
Professor of Political Science
William E. Jackson and two
student McGovern advocates
Monday night.

Junior Robert F. Touchton of
the Nixon team chided faculty
members, saying they were
“afraid to support Nixon,”
because several faculty
members believed such support
would alienate students.

The students, though, support
Nixon over McGovern.
Touchton said. citing the recent
straw ballot. “How do you
alienate people by agreeing
with them?”

Jackson began the debate.
which was held in the balcony of
Philanthropic Hall, by calling
Nixon the “trickiest politician
the nation has ever known.”
The audience, sympathetic to
McGovern.shouted approval.

Jackson then announced the
winners of several mock
awards including the recipient
of the Orwell Award, Sen. Hugh
Scott (R.-Pa.), who gave the
best demonstration of
newspeak. Scott earned this by
implying that peace is war in
his nomination of Nixon for the
Nobel Peace Prize

Becoming more — serious.
Jackson began his detense ot
McGovern by denouncing the
radical tag which some have
attached to the Democratic
nominee. “He is so radical he
believes in honesty.” Jackson
said.

Contrasting Nixon — with
McGovern, Jackson presented
several examples of
administration corruption, such
as unfair milk price supports
for contributors and refusal to
disclose the scources _ ol

campaign funds which probably
include $700,000 allocated for
‘nefarious purposes.”

Jackson, echoing McGovern
and consumer advocate Ralph
Nader said Nixon heads
“the most corrupt
administration that I've read
about in a long time."

Indeed. McGovern’ would
“threaten the security of rich
men,’ Jackson said, in seeking

‘to help the underprivileged who

the government has abandoned.

Jackson closed with a
condemnation of the conduct of
the Vietnam War. asserting
that a vote for Nixon is vote for
South Vietnam President
Nguyen Van Thieu.

Senior George Kaneklides.
who happens to be an advisee of
Jackson. began the argument
for Nixon.

Nixon's accomplishments,
which include his part = in
securing the 18 year old vote
and his overhaul of the
Selective Service System. were
reviewed by Kaneklides.

“The President's proposals to
the North Vietnamese have
been fair.” Kaneklides claimed.
“We are on the verge of a
settlement.”

Kaneklides also said that
Nixon would “consider
amnesty” after’ the — war,

although. in fact. Nixon has
shied away from the amnesty
issue and tied it to McGovern.
Students should look at the
overall foreign policy of the
Nixon administration,
Kancklides said. The admin-

istration has made visits to —

the Soviet Umon and Red China,
participated in the Strategic

Arms Limitation Talks and
turned around cold = war
rhetoric.

The economic situation is also
bright. Kaneklides contended.

Wage and price controls have

‘‘taken inflation by surprise’ '---
paychecks are no_ longer
‘eaten up.”

In answering charges of
corruption Kaneklides said that
‘boys will be boys.”

He, in turn, accused
McGovern of duplicity on the
busing and abortion issues.
Compared _ to McGovern,
Kaneklides said, Nixon is ‘the
most credible President we've

ever had.” The McGovern
supporters in the crowd
groaned.

The rebuttals began with
freshman Robert E. Mooty's
attack on Kaneklides
comments. Mooty said that
McGovern could end the war by
pulling the troops out and also
bring the prisoners of war
home.

Mooty then slammed Nixon's
economic program, saying that

POLITICAL DEBATERS

prices are still rising and that
paychecks, if not eaten up, have
certainly been ‘‘gnawed on and
chewed."

Robert F. Touchton offered a
rebuttal of Jackson's speech,
pointing out that ‘Nixon has
laid the base for a true and
lasting generation of peace
after the war ends."

Sophomore Paul R. Mitchell
in wrapping up the argument
for McGovern reminded the
audience that Nixon had
referred to Kent State students
as ‘“‘bums.”’

Junior Sanford L. Steelman
Jr., concluding the debate for
Nixon, contended that
McGovern is not the man of the
people. as he is sometimes
portrayed, but rather
represents a rich, intellectual
group. McGovern stole the
nomination, Steelman said.

Somehow many Congressional
leaders changed their thinking
on the matter and decided to
move for youth sufferage in
state and local races.

Not the least of con-
siderations was the factor of ex-
pense. Senator Jacob Javetts of
New York testifies that it would
cost $5 million in New York city
alone to conduct an election
where one set of voters could
vote for one slate and another
set of voters were limited to a
lesser one.

New voting machines and ex-
tra employees would have been

All traces of opposition to the
issue vanished. Since the entire
Senate would be subject to the
youth vote, they saw no reason
why state and local officials
should be exempt.

Ninety-five of them _ co-
sponsored a_ constitutional
amendment to broaden the
youth sufferage to all elections--
-federal, state, and local. The
amendment went through in
record time, with the full en-
dorsement of the White House.

After the youth vote was a
matter of law, President Nixon
reiterated his long-standing
support for the bill and ex-
pressed delight that it had gone
through ‘‘with full support of
the American people.”’

He predicted that student
militance would subside as a
result of his administration’s
foresight in providing for the
youth vote.

In the Senate, each of the 95
men who joined in the last
minute effort to universalize the
youth vote are making full use
of their record.

Campaign literature for
senators seeking re-election in
November invariably states
that the candidate ‘‘co-
sponsored the amendment that
gave 18-year-olds the precious
right to vote,”’ (as Strom Thur-
mond's circulars express it).

The crowning irony ot the
whole affair is that had Nixon
been successful in blocking the
youth vote, his ‘‘new majority”
of the American public might be
just a little bit smaller.

More votes for Nixon will
probably be Senator Kennedy's
only gratitude for devising the
strategy that will permit the 18-
21 year old age group to vote.

Speakers for Nixon, McGovern, await turns.
