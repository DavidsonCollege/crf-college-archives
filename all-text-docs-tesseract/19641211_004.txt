New Academic Policy |
Begun At Mid-Semester’”

By BOB HOLLADAY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Dean of Students, Richard C.
Burts, Jr., notified 145  stu-
dents by letter last week that
they had been placed on Acad-
emic Warning.

Burts’ Jetter made three re-
quests of the recipient. It asked
him to assess his weaknesses
and to creat a plan for improve-

ment, to consult his faculty or
major advisor regarding the
plan, and to make an appoint-
ment with the dean for further
review of his academic record
and plans for improvement.

The announcements were sent
in compliance with the new fac-
ulty regulation adopted last
spring by the college after it
abolished ite system of Acad-
emic Probation.

Freshmen Fall Below
Grade Requirments

The mid-semester grade re-
port revealed that the freshman
class has fewer members fulfill-
ing the minimum grade require-
ment than at this time last
year. There were 45 to 50 fresh-
men who did not meet the more
rigorous standard of 12 semes-
ter hours with a minimum of

changed.

That freshman grades are suf-
fering seems to be confirmed
by some sources, and denied by
others. Certainly the grades at

the present mid-semester mark

have not risen abnormally. Dif
ferent standards this year have
made. comparison difficult. but
there are signs that by the end
of the semester, when grades
are permanent, the freshman
class may not stack up acad-
mically to the freshmen. of pre-
vigus years.

The reguhation reads:

“At the end of each semester
and of each middle semester
grading period any student who
failed to complete twelve hours
of academic work and to (main-
tain a twelve-quality-point level
of achievement for the grading
period under consideratidn will

“tb. He must report immed-
iately to the Dean of Students
for counseling and for such ad-
ditional action as may be con-
sidered advisable for the im-
provement of his academic
standing.”

“There is much more respon-
sibility on the part of the stu-
dent,’ Burts said Tuesday. En-
forced class attendance and pro-
hibited off-campus representa-
tion.in. sports activities aré not
universally called for under the
new ruling.

“We want to see if there is
anything we can do to help the
man.” Burts said. ‘‘In most of
the counseling sessions so far.
self-evaluation has taken place.”
He pointed out an example of
one sophomore whose problem
of too many extra-curricular ae-
tivities had alréady been cor-
rected by the student himself.
“The student does whatever he
wants to do, and the college
tries to help him.”

About the overran effective-
ness of the program, Burts said,
“I think it’s too earry to say,”

though he did feel that in the
college's policy toward  stu-
dents, ‘‘this is in the line of the
way things are moving.”

In earlier years under the
system of Academic probation,
the requirements were that a
student earn nine hours of credit
and six quality points. ‘This
resulted in typically eight to 15
persons being put on probation.”

Two years ago, the number

of hours required was stepped
up to 12 and the number of qual-
ity points to nine. Around 50

students failed to meet these
requirements.

Last year ,tne entire system
of Academic Probation was
dropped, and under Academic
Warning a problem level of 12
hours and 12 quality points was
established. below which it was

felt unwise for a student to find -

himself. ‘‘We felt when a man
fell below this Jevel, we could
counsel with him,” Burts ex-
plained. He said that the present
situation gives him contact with
almost three times the number
of students he met with before.

A sophomore on Academic
Warning said he favored the
new sytem over the old. “‘It
doesn't go to your parents. This
way it goes to your faculty ad-
visor and the dean, and that’s
it:’ But another student shrug-
ged off the whole idea: “I don’t
need any letter to tell me I’m
in trouble.”

One prevalent opmion was that

Davidson, but that this course
of action would not be feasible

tradition as a small liberal arts

sports that are unsubsidized, ahd

could do as well.”

arrive on campus at 5:30 some-

, where in the vicinity of the Pi
Kappa Alpha house. A bus will
leave five or six children
grouped according to age at
each of the fraternitties. The
orphans range in age from 6 to
13.

The first thing on the agenda
is a get-acquainted session in
which many of the fraternity
pledges will act as hosts. Al-
though the details of the parties
will vary, depending on the age
group of the children, there
promises to be a great deal of
excitement, games, and sing-
ing.

After eating a special Christ-
mas dinner, the children will
sing carols and play games
with the pledges. Since the
pledges always manage to lose,
the orphans always win some
prize provided by the individu-
al fraternity.

The highlight of the evening

Georgia State College soon pass-
ed the university System as a
center, and then to the Univers-
ity of Georgia as a division. In
1955, it became an independent
unit of the University System as
a center, and then to the Uni-
versity of Georgia as a division.
In 1955, it became an independ-
entent unit of the University
System. From the handful of stu-
dents enrolled in 1913. the en-
rollment has now reachesd 5,600
with a projected estimate of
16,000 in 1980.

Langdale has furthered the
advancement of the college by
equiping it with a better quali-
fied and more creative faculty,
a number of new degrees and
programs, and a full student
activities program. His plans
to expand the physical plant

The Davidsen Westminster
Feliowship and the Queens

the South Tryon Street Pres-

Other plans include a work

followed by a discussion of the

non-subsidizatioz. !

Various ideas for improvement ;

of. the football program were of-
fered by those who did not go
along with non-subsidization.
The suggestion heard most was
an increase in the number of
scholarships given to the foot-
ball team.

Senior Joe Clyde Gamble
stated. ‘‘We should increase the
number of football scholarships.
We've got to decide what our
goals are. With only 40 scholar-
ships, ‘‘Davidson might not be
able to go big-time in football.
but we could at least compete
on an equal plane with our op-
ponents.”

This is the tenet of Dr. Tom
Scott, director of physical edu-
cation: “‘we want to be able to
compete,” he says. “This can be
done by increasing the Living
Endowment and by improving
our recruitment.”

“With the proper use of
funds. we could revitalize the
football program.” thinks sopho-
more Arch McCallum. “If we
were to deemphasize athletics,
many boys wouldn’t be inter-
ested in coming to Davidson.”

Several students agreed that
football should be completely
desubsidized. Senior Rick Brand
thinks that football scholarships
should be discontinued and di-
vided among basketball and mi-
nor sports which now receive
no subsidies.

Sophomore Frank Goldsmith
says, ‘‘Football should be de-
subsidized, and basketball left
as is. However, we ought to go
along with the new coach until
we see what he can do.”

Several people polled thought
that football should be left as it
is now, feeling that its advan-
tages outweigh its disadvan-
ages. Eric Nichols, a junior,
commented, “I realize we are

BICYCLES ABOUND

Wheels On Campus:
More Students Ride

Recently at Davidson there
has been noticed. a superfluity of
those who can not make the ad-
justment to our easy going
Southern way of life. The group
I am referring to is that close
knit clique, the Davidson bi-
cyclers, or, as they like to be
thought of, The ‘Cycling Cats.

In a publicity release put out
recently by The Bicycle Insti-
tute of America the fact is point-
ed out that today’s large cam-
puses demand some sort of
quick and easy transportation
for students. Here at Davidson
many have seen this and have
come up with an extremely
practical solution — bicycles.

No more long treks from one
end of the campus to the other
for these acute individuals! No
more time-consuming __ hikes
from dorm to Union, or from
Chambers Building to the sci-
ence buildings! Now it is only a
matter of seconds to any point
on this vast campus for these
men.. Hopping on their parked
bikes, they swiftly buzz from
activity to activity, saving time.
energy. and, for the economy-
minded, shoe leather.

Various means by which the
school might capitalize on this
“cycling craze’’ have been sug-
gested by members of the fac-
ulty and student body. One ex-
cellent: idea is the formation .of
a Davidson Wildcat Bicycle
Team. (To date there is no real
competition in the area, but
again rumor has it that Bob
Jones University in Greenville
and Allen University in Colum-
bia are organizing a competi-
tion-keep group).

This team coula consist of a
hard core of our most dedi-
cated bike men. coached by
the talented wheeler, Bob Jones,
and by the experienced H. Ed-
munds White.- After they have

been sufficiently established and
have proven themselves to be
beneficial to the college mone-
tarily and publicity-wise, schol-
arships could be given and a
special bike-stadium could be
erected. At the present time,
team hopefuls are forced to
practice on campus, using pe-
destrian paths to practice speed
cycling, and pedestrians to
practice dodge cycling.

Another proposal concerning
the administration's capitaliza-
tion on bikes is for the school
to purchase two or three dozen
tandem bikes for rent by the
students. This has been done at
Northern Illinois University and
has proven a great success.
There the avant-garde daring-
ly wheel their dates down coun-
try lanes and wooded paths.
Here at Davidson, the same type
of recration would be appre-
ciated and enjoyed.

A third proposal is a tax on
all ‘cycles on campus. Such a
plan is in effect at Vassar now,
and it seems wise for Davidson
to adopt it also. A bumper
sticker and a small yearly re-
mittance based on the com-
bined weights of the individual
bike and rider would not only
help patch up paths and pe-
destrians disfigured by bike
traffic, but would also prove to
be an added source of income
for the college.

All of these proposals seem
very feasible, and it is hoped
that jn time they will be acted
upon. If not it will be a great
loss to the college and student
body alike. The national pres-
tige which would come from a
crack Davidson Bike Team, not
to mention the monetary rec-
ompense, should be carefully
considered and acted upon.
