track team contesting in the inter-fraternity meet was ques- |

tioned. The point was made that these athletes, in top condi-
tion and necessarily men of more than average ability in track
or field events, were allowed to enter, while athletes at that
time engaged in sports such as baseball, golf, tennis, and track
were declared ineligible. c

Intra-mural Director Heath Whittle has an answer ready
for this query. First, we can clear up the ineligibility of the
candidates for other sports. The various coaches have re-
quested that members of their teams be declared ineligible for
competition in intra-mural athletics during the course of the
regular season, specified by dates in the intra-mural rules, be-
cause participation would necessarily mean cutting practice,
perhaps injuries, and other evils. The ineligibility of these men
is clearly stated in Rule 2-E, which, as most of the intra-mural
code, seems justified.

FROSH ELIGIBILITY

Now for the more pertinent subject of the eligibility of the
freshmen who, it seems, should be disqualified by the above
mentioned by-law. Director Whittle’s reasons are these:

(1) If freshmen track candidates were declared ineligible,
it is likely that fraternity loyalty and persuasion would result in
the particularly talented frosh’s refusal to report for track prac-
tice until after the intra-mural races were over, thus retarding
the development of the freshman squad.

(2) It is impossible to remedy this situation by holding the
meet earlier because of spring football practice which would
hold up as many, if not more, participants as the track practice.
Also, it is imperative to begin the frosh practice early enough to
have the squad in condition for their near-future meets.

(3) The performances in the intra-mural meet give coaches,
particularly frosh mentors, a line on the capabilities of both the
men who have already reported for practice and the numerous
freshmen having had no previous"track experience, and with no
knowledge of their possibilities until théy were uncovered in
the fraternity competition.

ANOTHER PROBLEM

Another peculiar problem concerning eligibility arose for the
first time this year. Bill Loy, Glenn Terrell, and Bernice Tur-
nage, veterans who have won points for Davidson, but who had
not won letters were at first-declared ineligible, but on investi-
gation, no rule was found to cover their case, and all three were
allowed to compete. The rules will be amended to cover this
situation by next year.
