"horse-girl
flying... 3.

By Sara Carlson
Taylor seat on a sixteen hand

white-spotted appaloosa was my
trademark. Other girls tried it, but
nobody else had my grin, my boy-
ish haircut flopping slightly with
each stride. Stretched tall, my left
foot centered on the wide back of
our cantering horse, my right foot
held in a vertical split by my right
arm, I stood in a great ‘Y,’ a per-
sonal yawn. Few people whoknow
me now can envision me at sixteen
performing gymnastics on horses,
leotard-clad, balancing, supported
at the waist by the arms of another
girl seated in front of me, circling
to a steady three beat cadence ina
twenty-four foot ring of sawdust,
wood chips, and manure. I could
feel the rubber sole of my slipper in
my palm, the smile pasted on my
lips to please the judges, the grip of
my team-mates fingers in the thin
flesh of my hips and the pressure of
her back against my knee. I was
vaulting, and I felt alive.

Puberty—the great betrayal—
finally caught me at seventeen.
Before then, I knew my body bet-
ter than any book, better even than
any pony. The arch of my back
wasmy pride, every degree of beau-
tiful curving an elongation of my
washboard ribs. My streng arms
could reach my ankles forward and
back, bending my body in deep
‘O’s. I was an alphabet, a fruit
bowl, acollection of broken bones
and tendinitis. I was a vaulter.

Few Americans have seen the
sport-of vaulting. It isn’t inthe
Olympics and is rarely on ESPN.
Few stables outside of Northern
California have clubs, and fewer
horses can endure a team of eight
young people cavorting on their
backs for fifteen solid minutes of
easy cantering to the left. We
describe it as ice skating combined
with dressage, circus riding, for-
mal equestrian eventing with acre-
ative twist, but it remains a mys-
tery. Like most horse sports, it
persists as a girl’s game; few boys
have the patience to learn the body
control demanded for safe practice
of the sport.

We gave up a lot for the mo-
ments of joyous melding with the
spirit of another animal. We sacri-
ficed breasts, hips, and other mark-
ers of growing girls. We kept our
body fat low and our balance su-
perb. Most of us devoted our-
selves to our team, forsaking boy-
friends and beer—the ultimate sub-
urban markers of social acceptance.

I have a photograph taken at
the National Competition held in
fire dry Sacramento on my seven-
teenth birthday, the last day I would
compete. The sun scorched us.
Wedrenched ourselves witha high-
pressure hose before entering the
ring; our burgundy and black leo-
tards were dry in two minutes. I’m
on Colin, my favorite of the club’s

KP's: A Delicious New Way to Spend Your Money

By Rachel Newcomb

A new restaurant has opened in Cornelius
that is definitely worth checking out. KP’s
Place is the sister restaurant of the North
Harbor Cafe and opened this past December in
Shops on the Green. Recently I had the plea-
sure of dining there and sampling several
menu items. The atmosphere, friendly ser-
vice, and excellent food all made my dining
experience incredibly enjoyable.

The decor of KP’s is comfortable yet
classy. Tasteful artwork is spaced along the
walls, which are muted hues of green and
burgundy. There is a convenient deli for dine-
in orcarry-out which also houses KP's chicken
rotisserie. A wide hallway lined with racks
displays 92 varieties of wine to choose from

and leads to a well-designed bar area, soon to be
christened "The Side Door" lounge.

Outside, a brick patio with outdoor tables
makes the perfect spot for summer lunches.
The indoor furniture is comfortable and attrac-
tive. Itis agood place for relaxing and enjoying
your food without feeling rushed. The wait staff
is very courteous and eager to please the cus-
tomer. :

’ Adiversemenu was the first thing I noticed
about KP’s. There is something on the menu to
please every palate, from vegetarian entrées to
beef and pasta. For the appetizer, I tried the
baked brie, which was rolled in almonds and
served with a raspberry purée.

It was so delicious with the freshly baked
bread that my dining companion and I quickly

devoured it. We also tried the breaded red
snapper clawsserved with honey mustard sauce,
which was very good. Other appetizers on the
menu include stuffed mushroom caps and
smoked salmon.

We began the dinner with a light garden
salad. The lettuce was extremely fresh and
crisp. For entrées, I tried the Delmonico, while
my partner ordered the fresh seafood and pasta.
The Delmonico was a very savory cut of beef
grilled and served with cracked peppercorn
sauce. It was perfectly complemented by an
Idaho baked potato and steamed vegetables.
The fresh seafood and pasta included scallops,
fish and shrimp ina white wine sauce with angel

Best F licks of the Year

By Scott McLean

I felt a little saucy this week,
so instead of the usual review col-
umn I opted instead to list my top
5 favorite flicks of the ’92-’93 aca-
demic year. All of these titles will
beouton video sometime this sum-
mer if they aren’talready, so in the
event that you become bored and
just want to sit at home on your
duff and watch an entertaining
movie, here are some suggestions:

5. Damage : An excellent pic
by French director Louis Malle,
this one stars Jeremy Irons and
Juliet Binoche as in-laws involved
ina torrid love affair. As an added
bonus the video promises to have
the scenes that were cut from the
big screen version in order to avoid
an NC-17 rating. This movie is
guaranteed to stimulate both your
cerebral and genital regions.

4. Unforgiven : This multiple
Oscar winner was also one of my
favorites of the past year. I don’t
know what I found so appealing
about it, but it was highly enter-
taining. This is a good one to see
with the guys--Clint Eastwood’s
macho character is bound to rub
off on you a little so you’ll leave
the theater feeling quite manly. A
good male-bonding movie.

3. Basic Instinct/Groundhog
Day: Hmmmm... A definite tie.
Though “Basic Instinct” came out
early last year way before the
present school year began, I still

find it unforgettable, don’t you? I
bow before the altar of Sharon
Stone. On the other hand, if good
clean fun is what you’ re after, noth-
ing will beat the charm of “Ground-
hog Day.” This is one of the best
live-action PG-rated films tocome
out in a while. It will provide
laughs and fun for the whole fam-
ily.

2. La Femme Nikita : This
one actually came out a couple of
years ago, but when I saw the
American remake Point of No Re-
turn a few weeks back I was re-
minded of how much I enjoyed the
original. Anne Parillaud is excel-
lent as the female assassin Nikita
and the whole film merits a big
thumbs up. I saw this movie with
my younger sister and even she
loved it--that means you’d better
run to the store for this flick.

1. Singles : First prize goes to
this Cameron Crowe effort which

‘entertained me on so many levels.

I felt as if this were the story of
what is awaiting our generation,
and because I connected so well
with the characters, it was very
moving. A definite must-see for
all the twentysomethings out there.
Kudos to Mr. Crowe!

Student Directed One-Acts Make

By Allison Wright .

The Actor's Nightmare, di-
rected by Frank Jernigan, and Min-
nesota Moon, directed by Ed
Cunningham, debuted Wednesday
night in the Makeshift Theatre of
Cunningham Fine Arts building.
These lively one-acts were two of
the most professional examples of
Davidson theatre that I’ve seen so
far.

In The Actor's Nightmare,
freshman Robert Ramsay was hi-
larious as George Spelvin, a con-
fused accountantcaughtin adrama,
playing the main role ina play that
he never knew he auditioned for,
much less rehearsed. Upon find-
ing himself in a scene from Ham-
let, Spelvin delivered some won-
derful, random lines from various
Shakespearean plays in an‘attempt
to save face onstage, such as his

sudden outbursts of “To be, or not
to be...” in response to completely
unrelated lines. Perhaps the funni-
estmomentin the act was when the
stage hand, played by Garbriela
Marti, appeared on stage as a maid
with a script to help George with
his lines.

Kate Dunlop and Rachel
Hornor were wonderful as
George’s various leading ladies and
both played off his lost, anxiety-
filled expressions with incredible
finesse. Dunlop’s haughty yet frus-
trated demeanor as Sarah Siddons
was instrumental in heightening

the humor in George’s pathetic :

attempts at acting. Myles Louria
was perfect as Henry Irving, the
stereotypically pompous director
(ascot included, of course) in
George’s nightmare.

Minnesota Moon was a won-

derful comedy about friendship and
change in a small town in Minne-
sota. Patrick Brown as Larry and
Edwin Thomas as Alan success-
fully incorporated the sensitive,
often tragic moments in the dia-
logue with the funny, redneckish
characterizations. The overriding
plot was male-bonding atits finest,
one last night of getting drunk and
“chewin’ the bit” in a deserted
barnhouse before Alan leaves for
college. But the dialogue touched
on serious subjects such as the
death ofa friend, the Vietnam War,
and future prospects, with realism
anddepth. Witha dramatic subject

a Success

matter and only two characters,
Minnesota Moon was a risk. But
the talent displayed by both the
director and the actors was more
than enough to successfully de-
liver the play.

Truthfully, I normally steer
clear of one-acts and prefer full
productions, but these perfor-
mances converted me. (“I laughed,
Icried,itwas better than CATS...”)
Anyway, congratulations. and
thanks to the cast and directors of
The Actor's Nightmare and Min-
~nesota Moon for a perfect blend of
humorand depth intwo thoroughly
entertaining performances.
