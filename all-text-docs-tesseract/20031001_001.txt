STRIKING A NERVE

Racist graffiti on a cement wall behind Belk (right) and on a walkway in front of the laundry
prompted five juniors joined by hundreds of students to make a statement against racism.

‘SYMBOL OF HATE’

Vandals could face hate crime charges

newest “symbol of hate.”

An incident of racism and vandalism has members
of the Davidson community outraged.

The letters “KKK” were spray-painted on both a
wall next to the Belk Computer Lab and on a brick
sidewalk outside the laundry facility sometime late last
Saturday night. Students have since turned over the
bricks and washed the graffiti off the wall.

Janeen Bryant ’04 described the vandalism as the

Lt. Jim Lyon, Assistant Director of Public Safety

said, “We’re conducting an investigation right now,
and it’s still pending.”

Lyon said the crime has the potential to tarnish the
College’s reputation. “We’re going to have to report
this as a hate crime,” he said, “and that’s not something
that looks good for Davidson.”

In a mass email to the student body, Tom Shandley,
Dean of Students, encouraged students to come for-
ward with any information regarding the incident,
which “‘has caused a great deal of concern, disappoint-
ment, and anger.”

This incident of vandalism is not the first of its kind

RLO: Underground lines
will ease cable TV problems

End of static? Plant
workers take action
after latest outage

By Marr GarrFiELD

Some creative thinking by the
Physical Plant may put an end to the
cable problems that have caused
TVs across campus to go fuzzy sev-
eral times already this semester.

The problem is pretty simple, as
RLO Director Leslie Marsicano ex-
plained in an e-mail to students on
Monday afternoon.

When crews installed the cables

12 years ago, they only planted them _

a few inches below the ground in
most areas.

The trucks and bulldozers doing
construction work on Patterson
Court have cut the cables three or
four times already this fall, and
landscapers aerating the lawn prob-
ably caused last weekend’s outage.
But Marsicano says it’s been a re-
curring problem for several years.

That’s where Physical Plant Di-
rector David Holthouser comes in.
He figured out that the cables could
be buried underground—in the
same pipes that contain the fiber-
optic wiring that connects the cam-
pus computer network. Then they
wouldn’t be so vulnerable to
breaks.

IN DEPTH

How the mp3 crackdown will affect students and administrators

Chief defends police

as scrutiny mounts
Walker: Some officers have been too aggressive

By BLEvIN SHELNUTT
Staff Writer

Davidson College Police Chief
Fountain Walker recently character-
ized his enforcement policies as being
“consistent.” Albeit enforcement this
semester has indisputably become
more stringent, several discrepancies
in police procedure still appear to
exist. This has led some students to
question whether officers even know
what their guidelines are, let alone if
their policies are reliable.

When asked to explain how his
policies were “consistent,” Walker
said that the only time an officer
should interact with a student is the
officer observes a blatant violation,
such as an underage student carrying
a beer across campus, for which he or
she should then issue an alcohol cita-
tion. The Davidson police officers
have not regularly implemented this
standard of enforcement.

Brent McCormick ’06 said, “One
student I know was merely sleeping in
the lounge at about three in the morn-
ing and was not drunk, yet he received
an alcohol citation simply because he
had been drinking at some point that
day. This type of enforcement is un-

necessary and useless. The student
was not being harmful or destruc-
tive.”

An incident two weeks ago at the
Sigma Phi Episilon fraternity house
also illustrates this contradictory be-
havior. In one night, two police offic-
ers came in and gave completely con-
flicting orders regarding alcohol.

Walker explained these inconsis-
tencies by attributing them to the re-
cent transition of leadership within
the Davidson police force. He con-
ceded that some officers have lately
been too aggressive in their proce-
dure, but explained that they are still
acclimating themselves with his poli-
cies; not only the students, but also
the officers must learn Walker’ s style
of policing.

Walkeremphasized that the goal of
the police is not to get anyone in
trouble but to maintain students’
safety. Walker described the in-
creased presence of officers at parties
as an attempt to develop a healthy
rapport between students and public
safety. He addedthat undercover of-
ficers will not be used to “spy” on
Davidson students, but rather to help

How times change in three years.

One of the first procrastination tactics the senior
class discovered upon its arrival at Davidson was
peer-to-peer file sharing, the practice of down-
loading music, video, and other media facili- ¢~&
tated in large part by 24-hour high-speed
network access and a little program called

Napster.
This year’s incoming class

reached campus shortly after the a : js, |
