As winner of the first prize in

: Bow! team’ s success due to intelligence, selection,training

By BILL PEEPLES ~

Professor of English Charles
Lloyd wants to talk of nothing
but the College Bowl competi-
tion these days. He has every
right to be preoccupied.

Although Mr. Lloyd refuses
to accept responsibility for the
team’s recent successes, team
captain Tom Ruby and -Bowl
coordinator William Brown give
him credit for pulling the team
out of some very tight spots.

In the most recent tourna-
ment held last weekend, Chapel
Hill was Davidson’s only true
competition. The Chapel Hill
boys proved that they could be
ruthless, and Lloyd turned their
unsportsmanlike conduct to
Davidson’s advantage.

By shaking hands with each .,

team member Davidson had
defeated before going into. the
- final round with Chapel Hill,

Lloyd won many converts tothe |

Davidson cause. Since the de-
feated teams composed the
audience for the final round,
Lloyd made certain that the
folks in the audience would not
dare cheer for the University of
North Carolina group.

When team captain Ruby

permitted another team mem-
ber to answer a question di-
rectly, rather than through the
captain, Chapel Hill launched a
protest. Lloyd rose and
shouted: ‘“That’s our four cor-
ners’ offense.”

At another point in the

match, Chapel Hill was asked
which planet is farthest from
the: sun. Naturally, the team
responded. with “Pluto.” Mr.
Lloyd, who keeps abreast of
current events, stood and an-
nounced that since January 25,
Neptune moved into a position
farthest from the sun due to the
elliptical orbit of the planets.

In both instances, observers
cheered, and Chapel Hill was at
.a great psychological disadvan-

"tage.

Mr. Lloyd believes that Dav- -

idson’s- success in the College

_ Bowl is largely, due to three
factors. “‘ Davidsonstudents are
_ smarter. It may sound con-
 ceited, but it is just fact,” he
~ contended.

Second, ‘ “the other college

lege unions that aye small

The recital itself will begin
with the Ten Variations on

themselves rathes than con-

sulting with faculty members.” °
At Davidson, Mr. Lloyd has .

solicited the faculty for practice
questions numerous times. Pro-

fessors Manning, Randy Nel-
son and Epes practice regularly

_ with the team, which Lloyd said

“has helped-immeasurably.”’

Third, with the possible ex-
ception of Chapel Hill, none of
the teams Davidson played had
adequate selection processes for
team members or proper
training afterwards. Other
schools ‘‘picked up people on
campus who looked smart and
said, ‘Do you want to be on the
team,” Lloyd said. — a

Mr. Lloyd is hesitant to
compare the current College

Following this is the well-

will perform the piano sonata of

with two preludes by Rachma-

Op. 32, No. 10; and the Prelude
in B-flat Major, Op. 23, No. 2.

Apparently, Reader’s Digest
has not taken as much time in
preparing challenging questions
as did GE. ~

The late Robert Earl, former
television «questioner for Gen-
eral Electric, was a Lloyd
favorite. ‘‘GE had the finest
man in the business. He knew
all the questions and answers in
advance. If he was surprised at
the speed in answering a ques-
tion, there was a reason to be
surprised. He generated excite-
ment that made the teams more
competitive,’’ he revealed.

“Nobody can beat this team
if it has the right kind of
training’ between now and the
next tournament in April,
Lloyd concluded.
