Pep band will play tunes to

encourage Cat hoops spirit

By Ashely Donnelly

Trombones, saxophones,
flutes, piccolos, trumpets, drums,
and possibly a tuba will loudly
cheer on Davidson’s men’s bas-
ketball team this winter. For the
first time in two years, a student-
led pep band has formed.

The group organized when the
Athletic Department approached
sophomore Gray Dyer with the
idea. Then, Dyer and sophomore
Dave Fischer assumed roles as co-
leaders, recruiting the students who
now compose the 24 member band.

Jeanette Scire serves as a liai-
son to the Athletic Department for
the students.

Initially Dr. Lawing helped
the group with their music, but
according to Dyer, “past the initial
advice, the group will be student-

run.”

The pep band played for the
Rhodes football game and will play
for at least one more home game.
The band will focus on men’s bas-
ketball, and will play at home
games.

According to Dyer, they will
perform the fight song and other
tunes to “get the crowd into the
games and raise school spirit.”

The band plans to begin in full
swing in November. Other songs
the band will play are catchy, spir-
ited tunes such as the Flintstones
theme song, "The Stripper",
"Wipeout", the alma mater, and
the national anthem. The athletic
department hopes to create a more
typical college atmosphere to at-
tract more community, alumni, and
student support.

Campuses see upswing in AIDS tests
0.2% of college students test positive for antibodies to HIV

By Mandy Curtis
It’s 1993 and more and more
college students are going to their
university health centers for what
reflects a generational attitude to-
wards sex, life and death. Referred
to as a “common rite of passage”
for sexually active young people

of the ’90s is an AIDS test.

Twenty years ago, the threat
of sexually transmitted diseases

was the biggest issue facing stu-
dents. However those STDs were
treatable, not terminal. Today, the
threat of AIDS is a reality that is
only now beginning tobe addressed
by men and women of all races,
social classes and sexual orienta-
tion.

The New York Times reported
on October 4: “On Ivy League
campuses and at community col-
leges, in big cities and in small
towns, students are being tested.
Couples are tested when they de-
cide to consummate their relation-

’ ship or make it exclusive, college
physicians said. Some sexually
active students are tested every
two months. Men and women, gay
and straight, are demanding the
testas a prerequisite forintimacy.”

From New York University to
UCLA to Antioch College in Ohio,
students across the country are

being tested for HIV, sometimes
right on campus where confiden-
tial or anonymous testing is avail-
able. In other instances, students
are given referrals for testing and
counseling off campus. Some
schools invite county health offi-
cials to campus for testing.

In the most recent study in
1990, the Center for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention in Atlanta and
the American College Health As-
sociation analyzed blood samples
from students of 19 different uni-
versities throughout the country.
They found that 0.2 percent, one of
every 500, were positive for anti-
bodies to HIV.

A spokesman for the center
said, “You still have risky behav-
ior going on on college campuses;
it’s misleading to think you’re not
at risk because you’re a college
student.”

Astudent from Columbia said:
“T definitely feel sheltered up here.
I feel that I’m ina culture where it
doesn’t happen to people like us.”

The Stigma of Being Tested

Some test settings offer confi-
dentiality only; while others offer
anonymous testing. In confiden-
tial testing situations the result is
recorded in aconfidential medical
record; however, these records are

alumnus honored for receiving the
James Hendrix Award.

After the game players and
their parents enjoyed a covered-
dish supper and tail-gate party.

Students and alumni had the
opportunity to mix.at various so-
cial functions throughout the week-
end. The Union sponsored a Band
Party at the Union Outpost Friday
night from 10:00-12:30 with mu-
sic by Electroluxe and a cash bar.
At 12:30 free breakfast was served
to the first 100 students.

Everyone was invited to at-

tend the Masquerade Ball Satur-
day night from 10 p.m.- 1 a.m. in
the 900 Room. The Independent
Homecoming Queen was crowned
at this campus-wide event where
entertainment was provided by disc
jockey Vincent Chu. The Mas-
querade Ball was co-sponsored by
the Union, SGA, the Independents,
and the Dean of Students office.

Patterson Court activities in-
cluded a Ladies Lock-in Thursday
night co-sponsored by Warner Hall,
Rusk, and Connor as well as cook-
outs and semi-formals planned in-
dividually by the fraternities. The
BSC sponsored a barbecue cook-
out for alumni.

easily accessible to anyone in a
health care setting as well as to
courts and insurance companies in
certain situations.

For this reason many people
prefer an anonymous test done us-
ing a code number without any
names. However, confidential test-
ing allows for interaction between
the doctor and patient and, if nec-
essary, counseling.

According to Georgia Ringle,
Davidson’s health educator, the
stigma of being tested is a “big
issue of discrimination” not un-
common in our society. Those
tested HIV positive may be denied
insurance, health care or employ-
ment.

Davidson in the Picture

Admittedly, there is not an
AIDS panic at Davidson and there
are not regular testing sessions tak-
ing place in the infirmary, accord-
ing to Ringle; however, the statis-
tics show that no one is immune to
the disease. For college students
the numbers of reported cases are
rapidly increasing.

Students continue to practice
unsafe sex despite the lectures,
knowledge and statistics.

Ringle explained the Davidson
Situation to be one of “serial mo-
nogamy.” Many couples agree to
use the birth control pill asthe only
means for contraception. For the
time, the relationship is likely tobe
monogamous.

However, itis conceivable that
those same personsinvolved in the
monogamous relationship will be
involved in another one after the 6
to 7 month usual time. Cheating
aside, it is not uncommon for a
Davidson student to graduate hav-
ing had 5-8 “monogamous” rela-
tionships.

The health center will refer
students to centers within Iredell
and Mecklenburg county for
anonymous HIV testing. “It is
always a good idea to be tested,”
said Ringle, “People need to take
care of themselves.”
