Union views alternatives to TVscreen

By BILL BARNES

Whether or not the Davidson
College Student Union will be
able to acquire a Videobeam
Projection Color Television is
still in doubt. “I think it would
be wonderful to have,” said
Union Director C. Shaw Smith.
“The question.is where the
money for it will come from.”

The Projection TV, originally
planned as a gift from the Class
of 1975 to the College, has gone
up in price since its acquisition
was first proposed.

The originally projected
price, in the neighborhood of
$3,000, was to have been provi-

ded in part by the Class of '75,
which has so far raised $1470.
$750 were to be taken from the
Union budget and a $750 loan
from the College.

Now, with a price increase of
$1,000 over the summer, there
is question as to whether the
machine can be bought at all.
Smith suggested several mon-
ey-making alternatives. “Some-
one might give us a thousand
dollars, which we don’t see on
the horizon.

“We could charge for view-
ing, say $.25, $.50 or a dollar;
or an organization, say the
Student Government or ATO,
could attempt a collection from

students. A thousand students,,

Johnston accepts position

despite obituary headlines

By ANDREW LAMAS
Senior News Editor

In early August the Char-
lotte Observer paids its re-
spects to Dr. Frontis W. John-
ston by announcing his appoint-
ment to the position of Vice-
President of Academic Affairs
on its Obituary page.

“T learned later that one lady
here in Davidson has asked four
people in town what was the
cause of my death.

“Apparently the woman just
glanced at my photograph on
the Obituary page without
reading the accompanying arti-
cle explaining my appointment-
not my death,” Johnston ex-
plained.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. visited Johnston at
his home on August 3 to ask
him if he would accept the
position of academic dean.

“My reaction to the Presi-
dent’s offer was very simply

a thousand dollars. Or we could
take another $1,000 from next
year’s Union budget, which
would be difficult.”

Problems behind buying the
Projection TV lie in the fact
that the company which manu-
factures the machine was not
informed of any specific inten-
tion of buying one.

“I frankly thought the stu-
dents had talked with the
makers,” said Smith. “If they
had ordered it when we could
have had it at the old price we
could have grabbed it.”

Smith has tried several times
to bargain with the company,
aided by President of the
College Samuel R. Spencer,
Jr., with no success.

Both Smith and President of
the Union Richard Wassen are
enthusiastic about the machine

this: I wish this situation had
never arisen. I finally accepted
the offer for two reasons. One,
I was for twelve years in here
(Johnston served as Dean of
the Faculty from 1958-1970)
and, two, at my age everyone
*knows that this is only an
interim appointment,” John-
ston remarked.

Johnston will continue to
teach at least one American
history course each term of the
current academic year.

“I regret that my teaching
duties will be slightly reduced.
I don’t mean I’m going to be
unhappy in this new position.

“Neither will I dislike what I
can do in this office; I only
regret missing out of some of
those activities which would
otherwise be available to me--
like meeting the new students.”

Johnston has scheduled the
first Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC) meeting of the

because “it’s not just another
TV.” Sports, specials_and cer-
tain movies appear best on it
and it will provide better
viewing than can be had on
smaller screens. \

He has toyed with the idea of
requesting a trial run for two
weeks to test student reaction,
but as of yet has had no
response from the company.

In the end, Wassen has a
word for the situation, “If
people want it we can get it. It’s
a worthwhile device, but there
has to be some interest in it.”

If the Projection TV is not
bought, the money accumula-
ted by the Class of ’75 will go to
other additions to and refine-
ments of the Union. “We need
drapes in some places,” ob-
served Smith, “and the Ta-
verne could do with a good
sound system.”

current academic year for this
afternoon.

“I'm surely not going to
launch any widespread college
reforms, but I’m not going to be
any stop-gap either. The EPC
has some old business left from
last Spring which needs to be
reviewed. That will be our first
order of business.”

Official college administra-
tive posts are not foreign to

. Johnston. Besides serving as

Kenan Professor of History and
Dean of the Faculty. Johnston
was Acting President of the
college from July to September
of 1968 and Dean of the Honors
College.

Describing Johnston in his
new role, Spencer remarked:
“His superb gifts as a teacher,
his eloquence, his authority and
good humor when presiding at
meetings, his keen mind, his
ability to work with people,
make him a unique leader at
Davidson.

“His contributions to the
college over the years are
immeasurable, and we are for-
tunate that he is now willing to
undertake another highly im-
portant service for the college.”

Johnston graduated with an
A.B. from Davidson College in
1930 and received his Ph.D. in
History from Yale University in
1938.

During 1974-75 Johnston was
moderator of the Presbyterian,
U.S. Synod of North Carolina.
He has also been a lecturer for
the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation (FBI) National Academy
for every session since 1949.
