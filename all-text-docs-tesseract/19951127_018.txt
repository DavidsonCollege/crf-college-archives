Hooft and Paffenroth win at East Carolina

By Car_o REYNOLDS

Facing an Eastern Carolina
squad of depth and experience gave
the men’s and women’s swimming
and diving teams each a loss, but
not without several impressive per-
formances.

SWIMMING & DIVING

Men’s captain Churchill Hooff
turned in an impressive individual
performance with first place fin-
ishes in three events: 200 indi-
vidual medley and 200 and 500
freestyle.

On the women’s side, fresh-

man standout Kathleen Paffenroth
swam her way to another school
record in the 1000 free.

Freshman Jason Prince fin-
ished the IM right behind his cap-
tain, outtouching several ECU
swimmers for second place. Fresh-
men Allison Hobgood and Michael
McCabe and senior John Rogers
all turned in strong performances
as well.

On the boards, sophomore
diver Jonathan Frost gained points
for the men’s team with skillful
diving.

“They’re a big state school
with big school funding. Outside
the swimming facility there is an
entire wall filled with plaques of
their All-American swimmers.
They have had a strong program
historically,” says Hooff. .

‘There are no more team meets
until after Christmas, but some of
the men’s and women’s toughest
competition has come since they
began their season on October 28.
The men have won two of their
seven meets: one against College
of Charleston and one again Uni-
versity of Richmond. The women
have earned one victory against
College of Charleston.

“The women’s team is very
young, and we also have five of

our juniors abroad, but we are defi-.

nitely building and improving. I
think most of the women are happy
with our performances so far,” says
Paffenroth.

Hooff sees the men’s team in
the same position of growth: “We
should be able to compete with
teams like ECU in a few years.”

Some might suggest the 1:46
Tyson/McNeeley fight lasted
longer than the Davidson/Elon
rugby match. After only one minute
the Wildcats scored their first try
and converted the kick-after. Dur-

- ing the ensuing 79 minutes, they

piled on 75 additional points and
only gave up 5. Atthe final whistle,
the Wildcats walked proudly off
the field and out of their fall season
with an 82-5 victory.

RUGBY

“We wanted this game bad.
Everyone contributed to making
sure we finished with our heads
high — and everyone deserves
credit for this massive blowout!”

tain, said. He was largely respon-
sible for keeping the team together
and ensuring good communication
between the scrum and the backs
which helped the Wildcats defeat
the Fighting Christians.

‘Davidson dominated scrum
play throughout the day, winning
90 percent of the set pieces and
overpowering Elon in the rucks
and mulls. Props Mike Ingram and
Roger Mills were the backbone of
the effort. First-time hooker Eric
Borgstrom, locks Will Bradshaw
and Casey Hawthorne, flankers
Thayer Long and Chris Smith, and
eight man Chris Frederick filled
out the ‘Cats forceful scrum.

“Good scrum play means good
back play. That’s how rugby works:
the scrum controls the ball, it is
thrown to the backs, and a try is
scored,” Hank Ackerman, asopho-
more center, said.

The Wildcat backs were able

rienced back line, reaping benefits
from weeks of practice. Seth Car-
penter led the way with a hat-trick,
Scott and Matt Burkhardt scored
two each, rookie wing Jonathan
Sipling, Ackerman, and fly-half
Warren Buford scored one try each
to round out the ‘Cats scoring. The
Burkhardt brothers and Carpenter
also converted 11 of the 12 kick-
afters between them.

Smartrugby won the game for
the Wildcats. The Elon try, scored
at the onset of the second, half,
came after good second phase play .
by their backs and the bullet quick-
ness of their substitute prop,
Davidson alumnus Mike Kessler,
helped them muscle their way onto
the scoreboard.

But Saturday belonged to the
Wildcats, and they will head into
the spring season in February with
memories of this very successful
final game.
