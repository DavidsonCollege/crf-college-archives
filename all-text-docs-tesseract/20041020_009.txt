Blood drive pressures students.

There was an impressive turnout
for this year’s annual American Red
Cross Blood Drive sponsored by
Davidson College ROTC, with both
veterans and first-time donors com-
ing in droves to the first floor Sf the
Alvarez Union. While most were en-
thusiastic and ready to roll up their
sleeves, some students found the en-
tire ordeal to be a disturbing form of
peer pressure.

John Gries ’07 explained how he
felt when confronted with the scene of
the Blood Drive, “The signs every-
where, the ROTC kids glaring at-you -
from behind the sign-up tables, the
bright ribbons around all your
friends’ arms...it was even worse than
last year. If there were this much eo-
ercion involved in something like
drug abuse, half the college would
need to be put in detox.”

Students like Gries feel that be-
cause they are in the minority in not
donating blood, the rest of the com-
munity regards them differently. “I
had to look away and duck into empty
classrooms whenever I saw a sign-up
table,” said Katie Nicholson ’08,
“when I went into the Union, I'd pre-
tend to check my cell phone or some-
thing so that I didn’t have to make eye
contact with the students at the table..
It was even worse than that guy walk-

Naming opportunities prove

popular in Chambers

After two long years, the renovations
of Chambers were finally completed at
the beginning of the fall semester. In
order to pay for these renovations, the
school has raised money by taking do-
nations from individuals and corpora-
tions in exchange for the naming of
halls, and wings, within the building. To
commemorate the naming, large com-
memorative letters spelling out the
donor’s name were placed on the arch-
way of the hall entrances.

Initially, the college sold the names of
each hall on all three floors of the build-
ing. Among the initial sponsors was
Gerald Wachovia ’75. “I suppose I
should have paid the extra hundred
grand and got the initial of my first
name put up,” said Wachovia. “Not only
do people not realize it was me who do-
nated the money, but even worse, it
looks like the school has allowed a big
banking corporation to sponsor it.”

Also.donating was Brett Krand ’80,
father of Mark Krand ’o9. “It’s great that
the school has allowed for smaller nam-
ing opportunities. I’m not in the posi-
tion right now lay out the kind of money
that it takes to be one of the namesakes
of the Alvarez or Knobloch Union. I’m

ing around asking
whether or not
people were regis-
tered to vote in
North Carolina.”
Other students
also feel pressure
from students who
were not officially
involved with the
Blood Drive. “If
you don’t wear
one of those rib-
bons on your arm
by the end of the
day, you might as
well be wearing a
neon sign that
says ‘I Didn’t Give
Blood,” Gries
added. At his first
Blood Drive last
year, Gries al-
lowed himself to
be pressured into
giving blood by his
hall-mates. Since
then, he has been working to tell other

students that they have a choice. “People

treat it like a requirement for gradua-
tion. That’s wrong, and I don’t want oth-
ers to have to live with the guilt I felt. I
happen to like my blood right where it
is—in my own body.”

Nicholson, after a week of dealing
with her stigma, looked up the term for
the fear of needles. “Aichmophobia is my
new favorite word.” Many tried other ap-
proaches to avoiding the Red Cross.
Jamie Douglas ’05, a volunteer at the
sign-in desk on the first floor of the

Union, recounted at least twenty differ-

ent excuses given by students. A group of
junior girls claimed to have traveled to
Namibia last semester. One freshman
said that he had eaten a hamburger in
Europe over the summer, and so he
might have mad cow disease. Another
freshman explained that she had just

- gotten a tattoo in a private area of her

body. Several students pointed out that

just happy to have the Krand hall within the
McCall wing of the Chambers building.”
Another improvement that students
might have noticed is the new bell on top of
Chambers. The bell, however, is one of the

they had AB+ blood, which meant their
blood could go only to AB+ patients. Dou-
glas’ favorite excuse, however, was that of
his own roommate. “He comes by and tells
me that he isn’t sure if he had unprotected
sex on First Night Down or not. I reminded
him that he definitely had not, but he still
‘didn’t want to takethe chance.” —

The administration, while respecting stu-
dents’ rights not to participate in any activity
they do not wish, encouraged the entire
community to “strongly consider the ben-
efits to others when deciding to give blood.”
Nicholson and Gries both agree that such
phrasing is not only an endorsement of giv-
ing blood, but also a clear indication of the
approval of one choice over another. The
Union Board, in an effort to pacify the situ-
ation, plans to organize some kind of activ-
ity for the day of the next blood drive that
will essentially be “something to do all day to
avoid Alvarez Union and the ROTC.” Says
Gries, “It’s a start, but I really think we need
to do more than just avoid the problem.”

few yet unnamed aspects of the new
building. All the halls are currently
named, as well as most of the classrooms.
Donors have also claimed many other
parts of the building for sponsoring. For
example, all of the remaining classrooms
have been sold out. These names how-
ever will not appear on the course catalog
until the fall of 2005.

Due to the unexpectedly expedient
completion of the renovations, many do-
nors did not get their contribution into
the college in time to reserve a hall or
classroom name though. In order to en-
sure that all who wished to help the col-
lege could, new naming opportunities
were offered. The bricks outside the main
entrance of Chambers will be sold off for
inscription. In addition, the college plans
to offer nameplates below the Chambers
columns to the two highest bidders.

The Belk family, consistently philan-
thropic towards Davidson College, was
one such late donator. As some may have
noticed, however, their generous gift al-
lowed for the addition of a commemora-
tive placard in their name inside every
urinal in the building. Another new com-
memoration will be the Cannon Handicap
Access Button, on the north side of the
building. The closet on the south side of
the second floor will now be known as the
‘Joel’s Grill Janitorial Closet, and the
Chambers building will be cleaned by the
Marlowe Family Building Services Staff.

Even the courses are being named. Fall
2005 will see the first offering of Fuel
Pizza presents Contemporary Political
Theory and BB&T Introduction to Eco-
nomics. Other courses that have already
been endowed include Pepsi’s Intro to
Psychology, Microsoft Finite Math, and
ESPN presents Literary Analysis.

“Fall 2005 will see the
first offering of Fuel
Pizza presents Contem-
porary Political Theory
and BB&T Introduction
to Economics”

Most students are apathetic about the
naming trend, claiming that they mostly
do not notice the new labels. Others see it
as positive, as it increases the College’s
endowment, allowing them to hire more
professors, such as a professor in Arabic
or Communications. Still, some students
are offended by the development. Said
Peter West ’05, “We are bombarded by
advertisements everywhere we go, and
now even within our hallowed halls of
learning we are not safe. What’s next,
Davidson College being renamed Time
Warner College at Davidson?”

Professor of Economics Troy Simms
explained that advertising is a growing
phenomenon in colleges, professional
sports teams, cities, and even secondary
schools. “Any time a company has a
chance to advertise, or an individual has
a chance to advance his or her legacy, a
market gets created. With little opportu-

nity cost, the organization has a chance to -

make a nice profit. Speaking of which, I’m
sure the College could easily clear a couple
hundred grand by selling the name of
Alumni Field to TJ Maxx or tent

Yankees hatred
sweeps campus
yet again

For some students on campus, October
means one thing only: baseball. For most,
however, it means something slightly dif-
ferent: actively rooting for the Yankees to
lose. The New York Yankees, World Series
Champions on twenty-six different occa-
sions out of ninety-nine total champion-
ships, are a team that many despise. In
addition to winning over a quarter of the
World Series ever played, New York has
lost thirteen World Series, and has been
eliminated from the playoffs four times.
Each of those seventeen years of defeat for
the Bronx Bombers has been a year of cel-
ebration at Davidson, going all the way
back to the 1921 loss to the Giants.

“How can you like them? They always
win!” said an indignant James McMahan
‘08 as his entire 2™ Belk lounge nodded in
agreement.

Other comments from students around
campus are all similar. “I hate Roger
Clemens! I don’t want any team he ever
played for to win!” exclaimed Greg
Markus ’o06. “Babe Ruth was my favorite
player until he moved to the Yankees for
more money,” Heidi Frizell ’05 explained.
“I’m a Bears fan. How could I do anything
but root against the Yankees?” answered
Nikki Venadici ’07. And, as Peter Cillion
’05 asserted, “I always root for the under-
dog, and in this case they are the low bud-
get Boston Red Sox.” The sentiment is all
but unanimous across the campus.

One of the few Yankees fans at
Davidson, Graham Edwards ’08, was will-
ing to give this comment, “I’m sorry, but
I just happen to be a Yankee fan. It’s not
like I’m jumping on the bandwagon. I re-
member the days of the early 90s, when
they were terrible. Anyone here a Melido
Perez fan?”

Another Yankee fan, Sam Katch '07
claimed that the majority of Davidson stu-
dents had no rational reason to hate the
Yankees, “The kids here just hate the Yan-
kees because it’s the cool thing to do. It’s
not like they are huge fans of other base-
ball teams or something, because I never
see anyone in the Union watching base-
ball unless the Yankees are playing. They
wouldn't know Bernie Williams if he came
up behind them and played a classical
guitar concert.”

Davidson has a history of attracting
students who, if not Red Sox, Orioles, or
National League fans, are at the very least
Yankee-haters. The archives contain in-
formation regarding a sizable donation to
the college’s endowment from Red Sox
owner John Taylor in 1916—a mere two
years before he needed to sell baseball leg-
end George Herman “Babe” Ruth to the
Yankees in order to finance a broadway
show. Evidently, the roots of Yankee ha-
tred were sowed four years later, when
Taylor’s son Roger Taylor matriculated at
Davidson. Allegedly, the elder Taylor later
donated a projector to be used in the pre-
cursor to the 900 Room under the stipu-
lation that only news reels presenting the
Yankees in a negative light could be
shown.

So, during the playoffs this year, the
Alvarez Union and countless lounges
across campus are filled with those who,
while they may not watch a single game of
baseball from May to September, will live
and die by the fate of the Yankees.

“I hate how Steinbrenner uses money,”
Bob Bramwell ’06 said,““Why can’t he be
like every other owner in the league and
just have players who play because they
love the game and not because they are
getting sei millions of dollars?”
