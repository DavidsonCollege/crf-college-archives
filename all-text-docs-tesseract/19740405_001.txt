SGA AppropriatesCounseling Funds

By STEVE BELL
News Editor

After an hour long
discussion at its meeting
Tuesday night, the SGA
Senate decided to reinstate
Merideth Hall’s current
psychological counseling
program for next year. By a
vote of 13-0, the Senate agreed

to subsidize Hall with $5000
next year, and the SGA
Psychological Counseling
Committee (PCC) is now in
the process of drafting a for-
mal contract.

The Senate’s action came in
response to the college ad-
ministration’s recent decision
to cut its financial support of

HALL
Senate votes to fund Meredith Hall’s psychological counseling
program for the 1974-75 academic year.

Hall by 50 percent.

This year the ad-
ministration is contracted
with Hall for two davs of coun-
seling on campus per week.

However, the adminis-
tration has recently an-
nounced that it will pay him
for only one day of counseling
per week next year. Two new
counsellors, W. Gatewood
Workman and the wife of a
new faculty member, will be
added to the program, and
each will also be funded for
one day of counseling per
week.

However, SGA President
Blain Butner expressed
dissatisfaction with the
promise of the two additional
counsellors. ‘‘The variety is
good, but there are disad-
vantages to having such

unknown quantities as the new
psychologists,”’ he said.

Further, John Munce, chair-
man of the PCC, pointed out
other disadvantages since no
counselor would be available
toa student for more than one
day per week. ‘‘The College is
pulling a fast one on us by in-
creasing the number of coun-
seling hours but decreasing
the availability of any one
counsellor,’ he argued.

Moreover, he pointed out
that Workman will not begin
his counseling activities until
the beginning of winter term
next year.

Referring to the Senate
response to this situation, But-
ner said, ‘‘I think this vote
shows a strong desire on the
part of the Senate to support a
program of proven quality.

$5000 is a lot of money for the
Senate to budget.”’

As Munce explained, ‘‘We
think it is important enough to
contract an extra day because
of Dr. Hall’s proven activity in
the past, and because we sup-
port an adequate time frame
for him to work with students.
One day per week is just not
adequate.”

The $5000 subsidy for Hall's
counseling will be added to the
Senate’s recent petition for
funds. This nearly doubles the
Senate's budget for next year.

Butner did express some
surprise that a decision of
such significance to the Senate
was reached with no dissen-
ting votes and only two ab-
stentions. Other budget

Young Chastises Neo-Fascist

By ANDY LAMAS
Senior News Editor

“The entire Watergate af-
fair makes me realize that
we've had a very close brush
with facism,’’ commented
Reverend Andrew Young
(Democrat), Fifth District
Congressman from Atlanta,
Georgia.

Young visited the Davidson
campus April 1, and ad-
dressed himself to a number
of the problems facing the
United States, in the decade of
the ’70’s.

Despite his initial harsh ap-
praisal of the Watergate af-

fair, Young commented, ‘‘Ex-
posure of Watergate was a vic-
tory for democracy.”’

The Congressman praised
the nation’s
processes, press, and
Congress for their efforts in
securing the facts about
President Nixon and
Watergate.

“Judges, like John Sirica,
have stood up for the truth
during this entire Watergate
affair.

“Sirica is labeled in
Washington as ‘maximum
John’ , meaning he is known
for sentencing convicted

Smith Secures ACU-I Presidency

By WAYNE GULLEDGE
Staff Writer

At the 5ist Conference of the Association of
College Unions-International in Toronto Canada, C.
Shaw Smith, director of the Davidson College
Union,rose to accept the presidency of that
organization for the coming year.

He carried with him to the podium a hefty speech
manuscript which caused some consternation
among his colleagues who were familiar with his
sometimes
extended speeches. To
the surprise of all, he
said simply, “‘I accept’.

This illustrated well
the character and good
humor of a man who has
devoted prodigious
amounts of his time and
effort to the betterment
of college and university
unions across the coun-
try and in many coun-
tries over seas.

Smith‘s ascension to the ACU-I presidency, the
first time in 22 years that the association’s
president has been selected from a school the size
of Davidson, climaxed years of work during which
he has held numerous leadership positions.

In past years, Smith has served on the
assSociation’s Conference Program Committee and
Resolutions Committee and in 1967, he was the
keynote speaker for the ACU-I Philadelphia Con-
ference.

His many contributions were recognized in 1972

a

when he became the seventh person in the —

association’s history to receive the Butts-Whiting
Award, the highest service honor that the
association can bestow. Smith was the first to
receive the award without previously serving as
president.

The ACU-I, which has members from nearly 1000
colleges and universities across the country and
several foreign countries, conducts research in all
areas of union operation. Its publications attempt
to make available the latest innovations in union
management and services.

Smith looks forward in the next year to extensive
public relations work on the part of the union as ‘‘a
vital part of the college experience’.

Smith feels that Davidson is now in a position to
create a union program which can truly become an
integral part of the college experience. ‘‘I’ve seen
what other institutions have to deal with and I can
safely say that the problems we face in union
operation are minimal in comparison,’ he said.

Smith expressed his gratitude to both the ad-
ministration for its understanding toward his
frequent absences necessitated by his ACU-I ac-
tivities and to the students who kept the union run-
ning scaslenameand while he was away.

criminals to maximum fines
and prison sentences. It’s
ironcial that many of the
alleged Watergate  con-
spirators must appear in
Sirica’s court,’’ remarks
Young.

Young has been critical of
the press on many occasions,
especially concerning the civil
rights movements and the
Vietnam War.

‘During this entire
Watergate affair, however,
the press has been unrelenting
in its attempt to obtain the
truth. My faith has been
restored in the power of the
press,”’ stated Young.

Young criticized the ‘‘neo-
fascist’’ group which was
allowed to form around Pre-
sident Nixon.

‘‘Almost every appointment
above the GS-12 level -- which
is pretty low -- has had to go
through Nixon's White House
office for executive political
clearance.

“Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson never displayed such
authoritarian acts. In fact, the
number of Republicans in gov-
ernment positions under their
administrations was quite
large,”’ claimed Young.

The Georgia Congressman
commented that Nixon
usually has moved in the right
direction on international af-
fairs but has failed to respond
to the nation’s domestic
problems.

‘‘Nixon has displayed a lack
of interest and concern in the
social welfare of our poor and
in the nation’s many urban-
area problems,’’ observed
Young.

Young is convinced that suf-
ficient support for Nixon’s im-

will manifest itself
ween now and July 4.
