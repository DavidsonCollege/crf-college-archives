love,” you expect them to end up in
Zimbabwe, smoking a cigarette and
smiling, especially since Kitana doesn’t
tell Liu how to steer until half a second
before they enter “the interchange,”
which is kinda like the inside of a
giant golf ball, if you hollowed
one out, and drilled holes
where all the dimples are.
(Not that you should ever do
that, because wiffle-style golf
balls just don’t work unless
you’ re playing in a low-gravity
vacuum like say, on the surface
of the moon, but who wants to
play there anyway, because you
can’t get any of the good cad- ©
dies, it costs so much just to
get there that all the players
are snobs, no one can see
your plaid pants under the
spacesuit that NASA in-
sists you wear, and the
whole surface of the
moonis arocky sand trap
anyway. Plus, golf ball
owners like your dad can
get mighty irate if you
drill one of their balls.)
Anyway, they
make it to the other end
of the line, but before they can leave the
station, they’re attacked by arobot ninja
named Smoke, who blows up the bridge
that leads to the exit. Well, then.it’s just
time to throw down, and Liu and Smoke
go at it, while Kitana fights the peon
human ninjas who also show up. This
formula disappointingly goes on
throughout most of the movie, with the
guys fighting the main enemies from
the game, more or less unsuccessfully,
while the girls kick anonymous peon
butt.
Liu more or less gets spanked until
Sub Zero, a human ninja whom Liu
killed in the first movie, suddenly ap-
pears and freezes Smoke just as he is
aboutto blow some more stuff up. That’s
okay though, because Smoke blows up
instead, and the explosion is pretty cool.
So now Sub Zero explains that he’s
really the brother ofthe other Sub Zero,
and hates Liu Kang but wants to protect
Kitana because she’s “the key to this
whole thing.” So he makes a bridge out
of ice for the two lovebirds to walk
across, but just then, Scorpion, who
looks just like Sub Zero, but is dressed
in yellow instead of blue, shows up.
Instead of trying to talk things out
like any mature, rational live ninja with
super powers should, he just starts fight-
ing Sub Zero on the ice
bridge, which of course,
breaks it. That kind of
behavior made me want
to: stand up and scold
Scorpion for breaking
something that’ Sub
Zero worked so
hard on. Scor-
pion then
forces Sub
Zero to
dangle from
the edge of
the bridge
over the bot-
tomless - or
at least very
deep -
.chasm._be-
low. I think
Scorpion was
* trying to make
Sub Zero say
“uncle,” except
Scorpion can’t say any-
thing except “Get over
here!”, which is really a coverup for his
fear of intimacy. At this point Liu
‘jumps across the chasm and rescues
Sub Zero. Okay, so I guess he didn’t
need that bridge after all. Scalawag that
he is, Scorpion beats on Liu, then
teleports himself over to Kitana and
then disappears with her.

Kang

Kombatant, Liu

@ Kitana

Since Liu has saved his life, Sub
Zero says that he will help him, but Liu
is kicking himself for not making his
move in the ball-thingy, and wants to go
rescue Kitana. Sub Zero points out that
cbyisisly Liu can’t do it alone, because
he couldn’t even defeat
Scorpion by himself.
Considering that,
and the fact that
Liu was sent to
find help, it
came as
, somewhat of
a surprise
that Sub
Zero de-
cides

to help Liu by disappearing. Liu then.

just wanders off into the desert, hoping
to find Nightwolf.

Liu finds himself at what appears
to be a deserted campground that night.
As he is looking around in the clear
night air, a wolf comes out of the inky
dark night and starts to maul him just
likea wolf. This isn’t just any nighttime
wolf, though. Surprising everyone in
the audience, itturns out to be Nightwolf,
who has turned himself into a wolf that
night. After changing back into a one-
dimensional character like Liu, he ex-
plains that for Liu to learn how to un-
cover his ‘‘animality” he must Pi ass
three tests.

To “help” Liu achieve
this, Nightwolf hits him
over the head with a magical
hammer that makes him pass
out and hallucinate.

Liu flashes back to the first movie
where he saw his brother killed at the
hands of Shang Tsung, whom he ulti-
mately killed in the inevitable Mortal
Kombat at the climax of the movie. But
his mind wanders to his new enemy,
Shao Khan, who has got to be really
evil because he wears a skull mask
kinda like Skeletor. Liu starts to
turn into a dragon to fight Shao

Khan, but wusses out

and wakes up. Safe to

say he didn’t pass that
test, unless it was the test
of being a pansy.

A pretty — girl

dressed in rags appears and
tries to make out with Liu,
probably because it’s sud-
denly snowing in the desert
and she’s really cold. He
starts to go at it, but then he
has trouble hoisting the ol’
mainsail, and tries to cover
for it by using the old “I’m in
love with someone else” ex-
cuse.

I guess that counts
as passing the second test,
which must have been the
impotency test.

The girl, who turns
out to be another MK char-
acter named Jade, gets

pissed and starts beating the
crap out of Liu, just like all
the other bad guys in the movie so far.
Inexplicably, she stops and explains
that she’s really there to help him, and
she knows a secret way into the castle
where Kitana is being held prisoner. Of
course, she later betrays him and turns
out to be evil, but strangely enough, the
information about the secret passage-
way is true. (It turns out that there is a

trap waiting for Liu when he goes to
rescue Kitana, but it is a really pitiful
one, as even loser Liu manages to de-
feat the two guards (out of an available

army of thousands) that Shao Khan has. .

set in waiting for Liu.) -

So, to recap, Liu and Kitana were
sent out to find help. Liu loses Kitana,
but meets Sub Zero who says he’ Il help,
then disappears, never to return. Liu
meets Nightwolf, who assigns him three
tests, only one of which Liu passes
(more or less). Liu meets Jade, who
provides him with crucial information,
even though she is actually evil and
tries to kill him not once, but twice.

This entire sequence just makes
me think that the scriptwriters managed
to put down the crack pipe for just long
enough to pen eight contradictory frag-
ments of 13 possible scripts, put them in
ahat and let a blind monkey staple them
together for a six-year-old nearsighted
epileptic who read them to the producer
while he was asleep after having just
eaten a large anchovy pizza laced with
LSD.

It’s just that coherent.

In an effort to add “quality” to the
movie, the writers sneakily steal cliches
from successful movies and try to slide
them into the story. Take the character
of Sonya’s partner Jax, for example.
This very large African-American spe-
cial forces operative gains a special pair
of bionic implants for his arms that are

not only very shiny and neat-looking,

but also quadruple his strength.
Throughout the movie, however, he
fights like a blindfolded mime, throw-
ing punches that say “Hey! ‘Lookout or
I’m gonna hit you!”

During the final battle, where he
fights a
mutant
centaur
named
Motaro,
his im-
plants
get
knocked
off,
and

things
look pretty
bad. But
then he says
to himself,
“Damn, I’m
gonna kick
his butt!”,
like an affir-
mation’ or
something.

@ Rain

Strangely
enough,
all of the
same
lame
punches and
moves that he had
been doing before now seem to work,
even though he is only one-fourth as
strong. To make the entire sequence
obvious to people who do not actually
have a functional brain, Sonya actually
says, “Oh, I see you got your confi-
dence back!” I have to say I liked the
whole “that thing you think you need to
succeed is really justacrutch and you’ re
better off without it” idea more in
Dumbo. :

Most of the first hour of the movie
is spent trying to reunite Kitana with her
apparently live mother, Queen Sindel,
because the Elder Gods tell Rayden that
she is the reason that evil ninjas are
raining from the sky. The Queen sup-
posedly killed herself when Shao Khan
killed her husband, and took over their
Outworld kingdom (which, despite the
name, doesn’t look out of this world.
It’s more of a big barren dump, actually,
with no malls or anything). But now
she’s helping Shao Khan, and blowing
stuff up because she’s dead, but now
married to Shao Khan or something
(which makes him into freaky necro

stuff, but they gloss over that in the
movie. I bet there’re gonna be some
kinky scenes in the director’s cut
though.).

Atthe end of the first hour, they’ ve
rescued Kitana from Shao Khan’s pal-
ace, and beat the live
Queen until she passed
out (which makes
no sense, but by
that point, WHO
CARES!). All
they have todo
is get Kitana to
kiss her mom,
thus really
bringing ©
her back
from. the
dead, and
I guess
annulling
the myste-_
rious bond
to Shao
Khan. (I
really
don’t un-
derstand
why they
didn’ ttry to
bring
Kitana’s dad back while they were at it,
but maybe he was all cut up into pieces
and stuff or something. Actually, that
probably would have been cooler than
anything else in this movie.) ;

In acomplete shocker, however, it
doesn’t work at all, and so they decide
that they should just go beat up the bad
guys, which prompted a few reactions
from me.

First, the “kiss from a loved one

@ Sonya

“ee

that awakens the Uiacglad royalty”
theme, even though it didn’t work out
between Kitana and her possessed live
mother, was better in Sleeping Beauty.
Second, the whole “lead the audience
along to an dissatisfying conclusion,
then reveal the entire. first part of the
‘movie was a lie fabricated by the bad
guy” thing was carried out quite a bit
more successfully in The Usual Sus-
pects. Then again, I get the feeling
this was the result of that whole
“Hey! How long is this movie sup-
posed to be? Over an hour? Hmmm.
Start on new plot to tack on to the
end!” problem.
Really, when a movie based on a
video game has a less coherent
* plotthan the game itself, I think
there’s a serious problem
with the script.
The most disap-

pointing thing in the
whole movie was ac-
: tually the title. This
chapter in the Mortal
Kombat chronicle
was entitled Mortal
Kombat: Annihila-
tion, butin fact, noth-
ing was annihilated in
the course of the movie.
Sure, some stuff-was broken, and there
were some neat explosions, but this is
really false advertising of the worst
kind. There aren’t even any net casual-
ties, as Johnny Cage starts out alive, but
dies in.the first 30 seconds, and Queen
Sindel starts out dead’ but ends up alive
in the last 30 seconds of the movie. It all
balances out, and that’s sad, because
this movie wasn’ ttitled Mortal Kombat:
Moderation.

Sagittarius. You thought you were cool because you knew how
many ridges an Oreo has, but you won't be laughing when you find out
later this week how many ridges the tires of a Nabisco delivery truck has.

Capricorn. Don't you just hate that your birthday is close to Christ-
mas? Solve the problem this year — drop some strychnine in Santa’s
milk and watch him “ho” his last. No Christmas equals more birthday
presents!

Aquarius. Your semi-formal dates will love you till the end of their
natural lives. Romantic, eh? Too bad you will die tomorrow.

Pisces. You will have a serious accident with an aardvark, a pocket
calculator, and five pounds of Crisco. But your biggest problem will be
explaining said accident to the emergency room staff.

Aries. People think you are evil, so you might as well be evil. As you
know, evil always wins, because good is dumb.

Taurus. The stars have two words for you: pork bellies. Plumbous
must admit, sometimes the stars are a mystery even to him.

Gemini. You will quietly “disappear” when your investigation into the
BaskinRobbins conspiracy at the Commons digs too deep. Plumbous
would tell you more, but he has already said too much.

Cancer. Doesn't it suck that your sign shares a name with a disease
that kills?. You will shave your head as a sign of solidarity with the
chemotherapy patients of the world.

Leo. You will discover a burning passion for your roommate. Unfor-
tunately, your roommate has an all-consuming crush on the Octel
voicemail lady.

Virgo. The bad news is that you will poison yourself with wood alcohol.
The good news is that the preferred treatment is IV ethanol drip.
Tolerance shall meet its match.

Libra. You are either a sex-crazed maniac or just an ordinary maniac.
You will discover that you made an error in hairstyling and shave your
head in frustration. Plumbous suggests commiserating with Cancer
natives in this matter. —

Scorpio. Both women and men flock to you. Be careful with the
androgynous ones — sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference.
