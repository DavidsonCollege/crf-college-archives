OPINIONS

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20 , 1990

skeleton in the closet, and it was
clutching a bottle of Wild Irish
Rose.

Unfortunately, (allow me to
use another tired expression herc)
the cat got out of the bag last spring,
and he and a few of his fricnds had
to be rushed with to the hospital to
have their stomachs pumped while
the trustces were paying a visit.
And now, thanks to the crack re-
porting of the Channel 36 News
team whobroke the story of de-
bauchery at Davidson (only. be-
cause they couldn’t find any real
news to report), we’ve got a little
image polishing to do.

Davidson has acquired the un-
wanted reputauon of a “party
school” simply because a few silly
people decided to spend an after-
noon playing “mine’s bigger”.
(Referring only to their tolerance
for alcohol.) Of course, I’m not
really being fair. Our alcohol pol-
icy necded a little revision any-
way, and all these changes would
be necessary even if “the individu-

als involved” didn’t act so irre-
sponsibly (yeah, sure).

I, however, am the first to agree
that our policy necds some minor
revision, but not the puritanical
overhaul suggested by the trus-
tecs. You sce, what truly makcs
Davidson unique is not its stance
regarding alcohol, but its honor
code. My suggestion is that we
come completely clean about what
gocs on here, to the trustees and to
the rest of the world.

Instead of having the fresh-
men sit in their rooms and drink
secretly before those really awful
(not to mention horrendously sex-
ist) hall mixers, why not give them
all a few dozen cups of Wildcat
Punch or something of the sort,
preparcd ever so lovingly by the
hall counselors sponsoring the
event.

Perhaps the college should con-
sider equipping every room on the
campus with onc of those mini-bar
things they have in hotels. Every
Monday, somcone from residence

life could come in, take stock of
what was used over the weekend,
and bill the students appropriately,
restocking the bar after payment.
Not only would this spare every
student the hassle of fake IDs and
beer runs to Cornelius, but-such
daring entrepenucrship would be
royally rewarded in profits.

Rather than force all students
to bring their own alcohol to
Davidson, the chemistry depart-
ment could help us make our own
alcohol. Instead of having a fridge
full of beer in every room, why not
offer cach student a shine produc-
ing still?

Yes, times are changing at
Davidson College, and we, as ac-
tive and responsible students, must
do all we can to make them change
for the better. Please, write any
trustee soon, and tell them how
you feel. Better yct, call ‘em up
and take ‘cm out for a drink.

(As usual, everybody, I’m only
joking! Please don’t waste your
time taking this stuff seriously.)

Legs

Continued from Page 5

fornia? Listen honey, I don’t care
where you come from, or what
your legs look like. Soweall think
that people from the Bay area are
gay? Iwantsomcone to say that to
Jose Canscco or anyone on the
Forty-Niners’ defensive line. (That
would be...not.) Plus [know a guy
whose mom comes fron San Fran-
cisco. Last time I checked, she was
pretty straight. But you know those
San Francisco moms. Could be
closet, I don’t know...

Yeah, feminism. I do what I
think is the rightthing. Women are
noless people than men. Notatall.

I just think some of this garbage
is,well...garbage. You know, I still
get in trouble for calling some
people Miss. I haven’t been ac-
costed for door holding lately, but
I did get yelled at for saying “hey,
man” toa girl (yes, I did just usc the
word girl.). The sad part is, |
wasn’t talking to the person who
got upset about it. I don’t know,
what’s a man of the nineties to do?

Maybe we should all shave our
legs or something.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS

I would like to take this opportunity to express my most heartfelt
thanks to the Davidson faculty, staff, and students the Davidson Presby-
terian church, and all others who contributed towards my return air plane
ticket to Kenya following my father's death. I also extend my gratitude
to all who have remained with me in their hearts and in prayer during this
difficult time. Special thanks go to Chuck Hasty, the College Chaplain,
for his swift action in arranging for my departure within four hours of re-
ceiving the sad news. May God Bless you all for your kindness.
Sincerely,

Stephen Weguld '91
