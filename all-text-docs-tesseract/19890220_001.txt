When Charlotte-Mecklenburg
public teachers walked out of the
classrooms Tuesday to demon-
strate for a pay increase in
Raleigh, the state capital, they left
many students behind. The dis-
trict education office only had
- 900 substitute teachers eligible to
fill 1,200 February 14 vacancies.
Frantic, the office called upon the

community tohelp.

Several Davidson College pro-
fessors responded to the need.
- Without being asked by the edu-
cation office, professor of mathe-

volunteer the services of certain
college staff as substitute teach-
ers.

Myra Joines at the education
office quickly accepted the offer.
ay “Weare so pleased because of
‘| their interest and high’ creden-

tials,” she said. =
-. Professors secured permission
to take personal leave days from

Dean of Faculty Robert Williams.

Williams approved all requests.

Participating faculty also sent a

Junior Amy Herndon, Spencer house
manager, said that the thieves were “polite
thieves” since they took the rented movie

letter to Governor James Martin, a
Davidson graduate and a former
chemistry teacher, asking for
support.

As members of the teaching
profession, professors such as
Bob Manning of the department
of physics and Hansford Epes of
the German department felt
obliged to lend their support.

“IT have a very great profes-
sional and personal interest in the
demonstration,” said English pro-
fessor Randy ‘Nelson. “Support
for the community is important,”
he added.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg teach-

ers are-presently paid on an expe- ~

rienced-based salary scale which
has not been altered for a number
of years. Senior teachers thus
receive the samie salary as begis-
ning teachers.

The decision to protest resiilted
in reaction to remarks made by
Governor Martin three weeks
ago.

Martin stated that due to inade-
quate revenues, teachers might
have to wait until April 1990 for

Jackson leads group support for teachers’ demonstration

the state to fund its long-promised
salary increase. The announce-
ment sparked an uproar among
teachers, many of whom organ-
ized to protest.

In Raleigh teachers hoped to
impress state legislators in favor
of the pay raises. Legislature will
ultimately decide whether to fund
the pay schedule immediately or
to wait for a year.

When the school board met
with legislators on Monday, Feb-
ruary 13, they received a lot of
support. Because of this hopeful
meeting, the teachers went to
Raleigh with high hopes. They
were supported by the Charlotte-
Mecklenburg administrators,
who promise to initiate a raise
upon approval from the state.

Both parents and students are
also aware of the problem,.ac-
cording to Ken Roberts, principal
of North Mecklenburg High
School. He added that he, along
with many people throughout the
district, look on with pleasant
surprise at the amount of support
the teachers have received.
