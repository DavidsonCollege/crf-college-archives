Athletic Scholarships |

Prohibited

The College Athletic Confer-
ence, frequently mentioned at
Davidson as an alternative to
the Southern Conference and
{ts subsidized athletics, is
based entirely, according to
its members, on student par-
ticipation in athletics ‘‘because
of interest in and enjoyment
of the game."

No member schools are al-
lowed to give athletic scholar-
ships, and neither athletic de.
‘partment officers nor coaches
are allowed any authority in
determining the recipients of
general scholarship aid.

Now in its fifth year of play,
the conference includes South-
western at Memphis, The Uni-
versity of the South, Washing-
ton and Lee, Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis and Centre
College of Kentucky.

LIMITED BUDGET

The conference maintains
competition in football, bas-
ketball, wrestling, swimming,
cross-country, baseball, track,
golf and tennis. The confer-
ence attempts to sponsor as
much intercollegiate competi.
tion as possible, within the
restrictions of a limited bud-
get according to a Washington
and Lee official.

Founded in 1962, the con-
ference brought together five
colleges which had previously
abandoned subsidized athletic
programs. Washington and
Lee, the last to begin a non-
subsidized program, dropped
subsidized athletics in 1954.

NEW MEMBERS

Additional members may be
admitted to the conference
upon application to the board
of directors and its subsequent
unanimious approval. There is
no intention to limit member-
ship along geographical lines,
although four of the five char-
ter members are considered
southern institutions.

According to Walter Bryant,
director of athletics at The
University of the South, the
system has proved a success
at Sewanee.

He pointed to Sewanee's un-
defeated football teams in

1958 (before the CAC was
founded) and 1965 as evidence
that a non-subsidized program
could work in a major sport.
Desubsidization did not mean
de-emphasis on winning. he
commented.

H. EDMUNDS WHITE

In CAC

He also pointed to strong
school spirit among both stud-
ents and alumni as evidence
of Sewanee’s success in the
non-subsidized athletic pro.
gram experiment. “I am cer-
tain,” he added, “that our
alumni are 100 per cent sold
on our program.”

“The fact that this is true at
Sewanee does not necessarily
mean that it would apply to
other institutions,’ he empha-
sized. ‘“‘We are not on a soap
box declaring the virtues of
our way of doing things.”

“It is simply a matter of
necessity with us," he continu.
ed, pointing out that the
schools with which Sewanee
competes probably would drop
them if they offered any sort
of grant-in-aid program to
athletes.

Financially, the system has
not been successful, according
to Bryant. He added, however,
that the university did not ex.
pect it to be because of its
relative seclusion and conse-
quent inability to draw crowds
to. athletic contests.

Athletic Considerations
Not ‘Out Of Line’: White

“In essence we do not ac-
cept anybody we cannot be
reasonably sure will be able to
succeed academically here,”
stated Director of Admissions
and Financial Aid H. Edmunds
White.

However, White also explain-
ed that athletes do receive
some special consideration by
the Admissions Committee on

the basis of their accomplish-
ments in what White termed
the ‘non-academic area.”

“In evaluating any applicant
for admission we evaluate first
‘and most important his aca-
demic success and potential,
as indicated by his high school
grades, his College Boards,
and his recommendations, in-
sofar as they indicate his po-
tential to do the work.

“*However, for every appli-
cant, we are also interested in
what he has done outside of
his schoolwork, how he has
used his time."

‘We will take people not so
strong academically because
we feel that they have some-
thing to offer to Davidson Col-
lege in other ways.”

White affirmed that ‘special
emphasis” is given to three
factors in the evaluation of
non-academic considerations:
whether the applicant is the
son of an alumnus, whether
the applicant is a football
player, and whether the appli-
cant is a basketball player.

He suggested nonetheless
that the Admissions Office is
not. really ‘doing anything out
of line’’ in giving such special
emphasis to athletic achieve-
ment. He cited Princeton,
Amherst, Wesleyan (Conn.),
and Sewanee in support of this
statement.

“I am reasonably sure that
these schools are taking ath-
letes who are out of line with
their normal academic stand-
ards,” he asid. ‘It is accept-
ed policy.”

In regard to the compatabili-
ty of awarding full, four-year
athletic scholarships at an in-
stitution which awards all of
its other financial aid on the
basis of the applicant's need,
White conceded that the policy
was definitely inconsistent.

He added, however, that this
was only ‘‘one of a number of
inconsistencies’ which are al-
ways involved in the award of
athletic scholarships.

“Also, it is the price you
must pay to compete" if the
school chooses to attempt to
compete with other schools
which give athletic grants.

In explaining the award of
athletic grants, White suggest-
ed, tongue-in-cheek, that: per-
haps ‘there are different kinds
of need.

“A school may give aid on
the basis of its needs, as well
as on the basis of an appli-
cant’s need—a coach's need
for a top player—or the need
of alumni for a good football
team.”’

“There is the negative fac-
tor, in that some people think
less of Davidson because of its
policy of giving athletic
grants." He suggested that
some high school counselors,
many other colleges, and even
prospective professors consid-
er Davidson's policy on this
subject to be inconsistent with
the college's academic stand-
ards and its general financial
aid policy, as.well as being
“inconsistent with the general
purposes of the college.”

NO BURDEN ON COLLEGE

Teams Need Su

By BOB REID
Assistant Sports Editor

The present policy of athletic
subsidization is necessary to
compete with other schools in
the Southern Conference, and
does not place a telling burden
on the college or the general
athletic program, a spokesman
for the Davidson Athletic De-
partment said this wéek.

“We give athletic grants-in-
aid so we can compete with
other teams around here,”
Athletic Director Dr. Tom
Scott said. “This is the best
way to draw good players we
need to build a team.”

Scott noted that all other
teams in the conference pro-
vide grants for athletes. Some
even provide aid for so-called
minor sports, such as track,
swimming and wrestling.

GOLF TEAM

“Some people point out that
the golf team, which is in no
way subsidized, won the con-
ference title and finished four-
teenth in the national tourna-
ment. Desubsidized teams can
do well in some sports, but
basketball and football are dif.
ferent."’

Scott said that the college
has two athletic budgets, one
called the general budget,
which provides funds for
coaches’ salaries, the physical

education program, equipment
and other related expenses.

In addition there is a game
budget which pays for teams’
travel expenses and costs of
putting on games here. Travel
and game expenses for the
various sports run about $18,-
000."

“Ticket sales from basket-
ball games pay for baseket.
ball’s travel expenses and
those of all other sports ex.

cept football, which just about
pays for its own through ticket
sales,"’ Scott said.
$45,000
Scott said basketball sales
also net $45,000 which is put
into the general fund. Ex-
penses in the general fund
would be incurred even in a
desubsidized program, Scott
noted, since equipment,
coaches’ salaries, and janitor-
ial fees would have to be cov-

As a positive factor, White
cited the largé number of ap-
plicant’s ‘who initially hear of
Davidson because of the bas.
ketball team.

“They don’t apply because of
the basketball team."’ he said,
“but they would not have
heard of us at all in a great
many cases had it not been for
the team.”

When asked to assess the
relative positive and negative
influence of Davidson's ath-
letic program and policies on
the number of applicants.
White replied immediately that
there is ‘‘no doubt’ but that
the positive influences are
greater.

“There are two ways to run
an athletic program,’ said
Athletic Director Tom Scott,
as an educational or as a com-
mercial enterprise."

“At Davidson we adhere to
the educational philosophy,
and we appropriate funds on
the basis that athletics are
worthwhile and of benefit to
the school,” stated Scott.

He explained that the athle-
tic fund is divided into two
categories: the general fund
and the game expenses in ad-
dition to the grants-in-aid given
to some of the athletes.

This year there are 58 full
athletic grants, 45 in the foot.
ball department and 13 in the
basketball department.

These grants range in value
from $1,825 to $2,135, with the
difference being explained by
the gradual increase in tuition
and other costs.

Full scholarships are split
by. the football and basketball
coaches so that this year
$26,640 is being distributed
among fifteen basketball play-
ers and $88,340 is going to 65
footballers.

The office of admissions and
financial aid is responsible for
all of this aid. H. Edmunds
White. director of admissions
and financial aid, stated that
the Committee of Financial
Aid makes the grants on the
recommendation of the
coaches who determine the
basis for each offer. The ad-
missions office then makes
sure that the college lives up
to the grant of promised aid to
the boy and keeps the overall
process in line with NCAA
policy, said White.

General and game expenses
for the athletic department are
met with funds which come
out of the Living Endowment.
The athletic department regu-
larly receives 34 per cent of
the Living Endowment, but
both the percentage of overall
monies and the actual. figure
has risen according to Alumni
Director Bill Bondurant. All
monies received from gate re-
ceipts go back into the Living
Endowment.

The general fund, including
salaries, offices, reeruiting,
travel to the games, equip-
ment, and the band expenses,
is $216,170 this year. Scott said
that $15,500 has been budget-
ed this year for recruiting in
football and basketball.

He stated that because of
Davidson's admissions stand-
ards it takes more looking to
find a boy who can both con-
tribute to the athletic program
and maintain a suitable aca-
demic average.

Approximately $200 a year
is budgeted from the general
fund for tutoring although
Scott stated that last year only
$140 was used. The Physical

Education program is allocat-
ed $3000 to $3500 a year and
the intramural program re-
ceives $1000. Scott emphasized
the fact that both of these pro-
grams make use of the equip.
ment and other facilities main-
tained by other budgets.
> Game expenses involve tick-
ets, travel, food, lodging, ex-
change guarantees and ushers
and is the only profitable seg-
ment of the budget.

All the different sports to-
gether last year lost approxi-
mately $25,000, although bas-
ketball made $45,000, includ-
ing $13,000 from its participa-
tion in the. NCAA playoffs,
which gave the game expenses

fain ten al a

category of the budget a profit
of about $19,000 according to
Scott.

Scott reported that with the
improved football team, sea-
son ticket sales increased and
overall attendance at the
games has increased.

He also reported that despite
the higher expenses, Davidson
still made twice as much
money by playing in Charlotte
for the Furman game than
was made by playing George
Washington at Davidson.

Fred Sackett, assistant to
the president, and Bill Bondur.
ant, alumni director, gave the
history behind the policy of

son.

Sackett stated that in the
1930°s and ‘40's Davidson grad-
ually moved into the granting
of aid to athletes “because
everyone in the conference
was already giving grants-in-
aid.”

Until 1955 or 1956 the monies
for athletic grants were raised
in a separate fund drive by
the “Wildcat Club," a group
of enthusiastic alumni.

At that time D. Grier Mar.
tin, then treasurer, succeeded
in combining the Wildcat Club
drive and the drive for gen-
eral operating expenses into
one drive for the Living En-
dowment.

os As CORRES

Alumni Opinions Vary

Dear Editor:

For some years now I have
been worried over the admis-
sion standards at Davidson
and frankly questioned wheth-
er too much emphasis wasn't
being placed on college board
scores and high school aver-
ages and too little on extra-
curricular activities.

Articles from last week's
DAVIDSONIAN such as your
editorial “Double Standards”
and Tom Thel’s letter concern-
ing Davidson's athletic pro-
gram are, if they are repre-
sentative of majority thinking
at Davidson, proof that some-
thing strange has happened to
the average Davidson student,
and I as an alumnus don't
recognize him.

I am not acqtainted with the
athletic contribution you or Mr.
Thel make to Davidson teams.
However, I do know that your
fellow students who are parti-
cipating inter collegiately are
spending many. hours of é€ach
day training and practicing to
adequately represent you and
your school. Should you not be
actively competing, it would

seem more in the Davidson |

tradition for you to offer your
help free in a tutoring capa-
city to your classmates rather
than to condemn the Athletic
Department's effort to help
them by hired tutors.

I, for one, am thankful that
Davidson's athletic depart-

sidization In SC

ered financially. Without reve.
nue from basketball, the col-
lege would have to bear these
expenses alone, Scott said.
Dr. J. Q. Wolf, chairman of
the English Department at
Southwestern-at-Memphis and
a member of the athletic com:
mittee there, told THE DA.
VIDSONIAN that the college
must pay all expenses of the
athletic program there without
any significant remuneration

“They're all squares. The real money's in football.”
(Cartoon from Saturday Review)

from ticket sales.
Southwestern, which has had
a desubsidized program for
many years, is a member of
the College Athletic Confer-
ence, and plays such teams as
The University of the South,
Centre, Washington and Lee.

CAC EXPENSES

“Travel expenses in the CAC
are high,” said J. M. Cham-
bers, business manager of
Southwestern. “Our teams
usually travel by air or bus,
and the college pays the bill.”
He said ticket sales provide
“very, very small percentage”
of the necessary expenses.”’

“If we desubsidized,” Scott
said, ‘‘we'd have to go to St.
Louis to play Washington Uni-
versity, Memphis to play
Southwestern, Lexington for
Washington and Lee and into
Ohio for Oberlin. No confer-
ence in the immediate vicinity
is desubsidized. Travel ex.
penses would be higher than
they are now.”

Scott felt that without a
grant program, Davidson
could not attract better ath-
letics who would in turn draw
crowds. Therefore Davidson,
like Southwestern, might be
saddled with necessary costs
and no way to meet them,
other than through a living

endowment.
RING-TUM-PHI
Recently, Ron Kessler,

sports editor of the Ring.Tum-
Phi, student newspaper at W
& L, pointed out that high
academic standards are not
enough to attract good ath-
letes.

“Why should a high school
All-American basketball play-
er pay to come to W & L and
play basketball in obscurity
when he can go to Davidson, a
college of comparable aca-
demic standards, for nothing,
and possibly play for a nation-
ally recognized team?” Scott
added that there are so many
excellent schools with fine
athletic programs such as
Duke or UNC, that Davidson
might loose good athletes,
whose presence builds lucra-
tive teams. -

‘Scott argued that such a
grant program need not lower
admissions standards. He
pointed out that several crack
athletes do well here and had
excellent high school records.

“If anyone lowers standards
for athletes,’’ Scott said, ‘that
is the fault of the Admissions
Committee." He denied any
knowledge of coercion by var-
ious coaches on the Admis-
sions Committee to admit.

ents interested in ‘‘competi-

that’s the reason there aren't

Dear Editor:
The controversy swirling

around. re-examination of Da-
vidson’s athletic -policies I
note with much intérest. While
a student at Davidson, I did
some investigation into what
was then termed “‘athleticitis."*
The arguments for re-examina-
tion then seemed to fall into
three areas.

Desirability: The payment of
tutors for athletes out. of school
funds and the entire subsidiza-
tion program for studént ath-
letes both point up one fact:
Students. on athletic scholar-
ships are first and foremost
employees of the school. Stud-
ents on athletic scholarships
have a double set of obliga-
tions and loyalties to the ex-
tent that they are, in effect.
hired athletes, paid to play
and play well, and only second-
arily to seek academic excel-
lence. .

That point Jeads into a con-
sideration of why Davidson
should spend so much time,
energy, and money to build
big-time athletic teams. Low-
ering of academic standards.
deliberately for prospective
athletes because they are
athletes has produced some
interesting justifications. But
the Visiting Committee of the
Southern Association of Col-
leges and Schools took a very
critical view of Davidson's
commitment to big-time ath-
letics—why don’t some of you
persuade the Administration
to show you their comments
(contained in a secret report,
never released to the general
public)?

Cost: ,.With sophisticated
bookkeeping the actual costs
of big-time professional ath.
letics could remain a secret

In Athletic Controversy

forever. The Administration
(when I was there) said that
the program was nearly self-
supporting—I still have my
doubts. But one can turn to
page 135 of the Self-Study re-
port and see for himself that
in about twenty years the cost
of athletic scholarships will
be equivalent to the entire
Living Endowment fund.

Keeping this in mind. figure
the cost of*equipping 50 foot-
ball players and keeping up_
the supporting athletic facili-
.ties. There is a tremendous
expense for big-time and in-
tercollegiate football and
basketball teams. Is it worth
it? And at what cost to Da-
vidson's traditional goals? You
decide.

Another factor is the cold
and brutal fact that to keep up
in Southern Conference foot-
ball, Davidson .would have to
double its now 35 football
scholarships. I have nothing
but praise and admiration for
the great job that Coach Smith
and the 30 boys in varsity
football. are doing. I’ve heard
other coaches say that Smith
is one of the finest young men
in collegiate coaching. But
even as fine a coach. as Coach
Smith can't win consistently.
against squads with twice as
many players almost as good:
as ours.

Alternatives: One: Pull out
of the Southern Conference
and go independent—the prob-
lem here is there are very
few other independent schools
in the area. Two: Pull out
of intercollegiate football and
basketball altogether—as has
done Emory University, a fast-
rising educational institution
in Atlanta. This is a step that
will require much forethought:

At any rate, I'm glad to see
that there are other students
concerned about Davidson's
commitment to big-time pro.
fessional athletic teams. It’s a
major question and deserves
everyone's careful considera-
tion.
