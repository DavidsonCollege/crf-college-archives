Point, told those who attended “Y" vespers last
Sunday afternoon.

“France has sent Laval to America, believing

that by sitting down and talking things over
face to face with our statesmen, more can be
done.” é

Speaking on “The Magic Sword of Speech,”
Dr. Nabers asserted that there are three things
that set man apart from other animals. “Man
is the only animal in the world with an upward
look; he is the only animal that Worries, and
the only one with the ability to talk and speak
at the time.” He put emphasis on the
point that every time people curse they misuse

Here he defined profanity. “Profanity con-
sists in taking ideas and words that stand for
the highest and noblest things in life and bring-
ing them down into dust and filth.” He contin-

they ought to bless and honor God. The speaker

claimed that in most cases folks curse through
force of habit. Association is another powerful

Air Marker Completed

The location of Davidson College is
no longer a problem to aviators flying
north or south on the New York-At-
lanta air route. For “DAVIDSON
COLLEGE” has been painted on the
roof of Chambers Building in huge,
seven-foot letters, together with a 40-
foot arrow, pointing north.

Completed Tuesday, the letters stand,
a bright yellow on the black back-
ground, on the northern incline of the
South wing. *

The lettering was done by the “Car-

rection of W. A. McKnight; the stage man-

The scene of “The Monkey's Paw” is laid in
a modest little cottage in England, and the plot
is woven around a mystical monkey's paw, which
causes many complications throughout the play.
The cast was: An old English couple, Horace
Ervin and Miss Adele Arbuckle; Herbert, their

Dr. Robert W. Miles

to Lead ‘‘Y’’ Services

The date of the fall evangelistic services has
been changed from the tenth of November to
the seventeenth. The reason for this is that Dr.
Robert W. Miles, who is to conduct the serv-
ices, finds it impossible to get here on the date
that was formerly decided upon.

Dr. Miles is a graduate of Davidson, and
while here was an outstanding leader on the
campus. He was one of the most popular men
on the hill, was a member of the football and
the basketball and in
several other fields. He came back to Davidson

in 1918 as the first secretary of the Y. M,C. A.

He is thoroughly acquainted with student life
problems, having student at

from that place he went to his present pastorate

and been pastor

A change has been made in the plans for con

ducting the evangelistic services this year, In-

stead of starting on Sunday, the first meeting
of the series will be Tuesday morning in chapel.
They will continue twice a day, once at chapel
and again in the evening, through Friday night,

The Masquers’ second presentation
of the season will be on Saturday eve-
ning, November 7th, after the Citadel
game. The bill will again consist of
two one-act plays and possibly an in-
terlude. The plays chosen are “Bound
East for Cardiff,” by Eugene O’Neill,
a picture of raw life among ab'e-bod‘ed
seamen, and “Sham,” a comedy aatir-
izing the superficialities of high social
life and the ideaof keeping up with
the Joneses. :

The casts, which are just beginning
work, have been chosen from the many
applicants for tryouts, numbering as
many as forty, from the Freshman
class alone. They will be announced
later. Directors of the respective plays
are Bill McKnight, who directed “The
Mayor and the Manicure,” and Johnny
Marvin, while stage work will be done
by Grainger Williams and Horace Er-
