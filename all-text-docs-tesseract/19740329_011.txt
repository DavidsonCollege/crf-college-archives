Eleven

Hunger, Cold, And Mad Dogs

The SP yard in Houston i is roe
amazing

monument to the bygone im-
portance of the railroad
system as the principal mode
of transport in early America.
This monstrosity has over 200
miles of track within its nearly
five mile area and handles
more freight than any other
yard in the world except the
Chicago. It was within the bor-
ders of this maniacal, crazed
environment that Ted and I
were to encounter the forces of
Good, Evil and Surrep-
titiousness.

Because Ted and I had
taken an extra twenty or thir-
ty minutes to eat before get-
ting to the SP yard, we
naturally missed the fastest
freight train in the world
which just happened to run
directly from Houston to Tuc-
son with only one stop in El
Paso. We were standing
beside the train as it pulled
out. :

We sprinted to retreive our
packs but when we returned
the train hoa chugged out of

distance. Settling for the
second fastest train in
America, we boarded.

The boxcar was a ‘‘Hydra-
Cushion": the type of car used
to transport eggs and other
fragile cargos. After five days
of riding noisy, cold, bumpy
boxcars, the Hydra-Cushion
was sorely welcomed.

Five minutes before the
train was to start on its way to
Tucson the action started. Ted
and I lay in our sleeping bags
on the verge of collapse. Five
days of near total abstinence
and a grand total of less than
ten hours sleep began to take
its toll.

My head was buzzing. As
one eye opened in a spasm due
to the lack of some body
chemical or another, | noticed
a heliocopter hovering nearby
scanning the ground with a
searchlight. I then heard
gravel crunch under the com-
bined weight of several men;
then Hell broke loose.

A snarling, growling
Alsatian leaped into the car
and raced toward our camp
with evil intent, stopping bare
inches from our throats
restrained by the thick leather
leash which the trainer at-
tempted to lengthen much to
our discomfort. Fear shot
adrenalin through my body as
the dog neared and I noticed
the gleam of two shafts of
metal pointed in my direction

by the armed Houston
policemen.

I crawled from my sleeping
bag, arms upraised and
pressed against the smooth
wooden walls of the Hydra-
under the cold stares of the
silent police.

I was perspiring freely as
the dog lunged at my cringing
body. My knees turned to rub-
ber and I fell back onto the
cool nylon bag at my feet even
amidst the hoarse shouts of
the three officials which prom-
pted us to our feet and to the
side of the car.

Ted's reaction was similar
to mine. Adrenalin activated
organs and muscles misdirec-
ted our body energy to the
point that our every move was
opposed, as in lockjaw, by its
opposing muscle. I kept

of the stories oft
repeated among the fraternity
of hitchhikers of brutality,
cruelite and arrest without
bond.

Ted and I crept to the edge
of the car and jumped off. We
were frisked brusquely and
curtly told to remove all our
luggage from our packs.

Three sets of piercing human
eyes and one pair of vicious
canine eyes followed our
every move producing a
surrealistic effect upon us. We
were on stage performing for
three strangers and their pet
dog. Reality vanished.

After a cursory search of
our luggage failed to turn up
any type of contraband, the
trainer muzzled the dog and
remained staring at us. They
took all of our identification
and transcribed the in-
formation onto an official
looking black clipboard. The
other two police had stopped
interrogating us and Ted and I
took advantage of their silence
to ask a few questions of our
own.

Why are you hassling us?
What did we do wrong? Is it
usual police tactics to use dogs
to sniff out travelers?

The police responded ter-
sely. A girl and her boyfriend

had been “parking” in the
trainyard when a 6'5” wild
man had jumped from a box-
car, pistol-whipped the
boyfriend, and raped the girl
in the parked car. The at-
tacker-rapist then abducted
the girl and was still at large.
The search was for them.

We pressed their mistake to
its full advantage but the
police would not relent. No, we
could not just get back onto
the train but, ves one of the of-

ficers would drive us to the in-
terstate so that we could hit-
chhike. A ten minute ride in a

to San Antonio where we found
a train going all the way to
Tucson. We talked to the
engineer of that train. The
only thing he said was that a
night ride across the desert
would be cold in a boxcar and
that he would leave the last
unit open so that we could
warm ourselves during the
night if we should happen to
get chilly.

As it turned out, the only
unused car on the train was an
empty three level gondola
used to transport autos. We
climbed aboard and shortly
pulled out of San Antonio.

The implications of riding
on an open gondola at 70 miles
an hour through the sub-
freezing desert were im-
mediately known. As sc«in as
the sun set, the temperature
dropped forty degrees in ten

minutes.

before reaching the outskirts
of San Antonio, we had emp-
tied our packs and donned
every bit of clothing that we
carried. Still freezing, we both
huddled in our sleeping bags
to await the coming of dawn,
still twelve hours away.

Tossing and turning in the
cramped confines of a
sleeping bag for twelve hours,
we explored every means
possible to conserve our body
heat. At one point during the
night I crawled to the edge of
the gondola - still swathed in
my sleeping bag - to seriously
consider rolling off.

A classic battle raged
within my head. Should 1
jump? I could not be sure that
I would die from the impact of
jumping: surely my battered
body would be in little shape to
walk to the nearest settlement
over 200 miles distant.

If I were to stay, would my
frostbitten members be of any
use anyway. I considered the
situation from every angle
and wearily rolled back to the
middle of the car, gritted my
ss teeth, and stuck it

ov When the sun did appear the
next morning, I knew theworst
was over and that definitely I
would not try anything similar
ever again.

That next day the two of us
were both unbelievably

irritable due tothe persisting

chills which continued to

suspiciously as
proached. It backed off a bit
when it saw saliva dripping
from our mouths. No use, even
if we could knock it out with a

direction. Isn't that cattle
rustling?-Bum rap for sure! !

The steer saw _ the
malevolence disappear from
our contenances and returned
to his business of foraging the
near empty enclosure in which
he was placed while a nest of
roadrunners were busy
evading two hunger-crazed
maniacs who should have
known better than to try to
catch them. With Tucson but
60 miles from where we stood,
we returned to the car and
awaited take-off.

As we winded our way

through myriads of imaginary

mountains, the thought struck
us that maybe the train would
only pass through Tucson
without stopping. Prodded by
hunger and the thought that
the train would not stop until
Yuma, Ted clammered to the
first level of the gondola and
started to unload our packs.

I stood on the second level of
the gondola and watched as he
pitched the gear over the side
of the yet moving train. As the
packs hit the ground besidethe
train they would loose momen-
tum then roll under the front
set of wheels to re-emerge
perilously close to the rear set
of wheels - a disturbing fact as
I realized that I would be jum-
ping also. The last sleeping
bag left Ted’s hand; he
off from the ladder with both
his hands and feet and yelled
for me to follow him.

I scurried to the first level
and shoved off with my left
foot, leaping as far away from
the moving car as possible. No
sooner had I jumped than I felt
my feet go out from under me
and my head hit the soft sand
underneath. I somersaulted

three times backwards and
skidded to a stop. A quick bone
check revealed that nothing
was broken and I then realized
that we had ‘‘jumped ship”’ too
soon: we were still only on the

very southern edge

The sudden impact of being in
Tucson was enough. We took
to the road and picked up a
ride to a friend’s house.

Thereafter followed several
days of recuperation and wild
revelry in Tucson and Mexico,
and the dreary thought of the
retu.a trip.

At the trainyard in Tucson
we waited several hours for a
train that would take us to
Houston. We planned to ‘“‘ride
the rails” to Houston then to
hitchhike the rest of the way to
Davidson. Our train pulled out
and we noticed that there were
no open boxcars, only the
same type of car carrier that
we had last ridden across the
desert.

This time luck was with us.
The car carriers were loaded
with some of Detroit’s finest
returning from Los Angeles.
We stowed our gear and sud-
denly realized that our section
of the train was the focus of at-
tention for at least ten people
who were running at top speed
from all directions with the in-
tention of joining us.

A Mexican with a coat
hanger appeared. He swiftly
picked out the most luxurious
car and opened the door. Ted,
Oscar (the Mexican) and I set-
tled into the car and turned on
the radio for some _ long-
distance cruising music. A few
reefers appeared and disap-
peared.

Imagine the scene, we were
cruising at 70 miles an hour in
a Ford station wagon facing
West and moving East on the
top deck of the car carrier as
the desert disintegrated into a
thousand different colors un-
der the force of blue and gold
shafts of sunlight which crept
over the small mountains and
struck the desert floor. ‘‘Sun-
shine, almost always makes
me high...’’*

When Houston loomed in the
near distance, we began to
comprehend that our ex-
cursion was at an end. Relief
and regret flooded our senses
as Ted and I shook hands with
the remaining passengers and
lugged our equipment to the
interstate to start our 1000
mile trek back to Davidson.

In all, we spent over 11 days
on the rails and traveled over
4000 miles. Spread over those
11 days was enough food for
one good meal and enough
sleep for one night’s rest. We
did not begrudge either the
lack of sleep or the lack of
food. The trip, for us, had been
worthwhile.
