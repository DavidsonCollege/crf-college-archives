There are millions who would like to know
the answer to this question, and about as
many who have the answer. My answer-
is added co the rest. Hider is such a con-
ceited idiot that he fecls that he cannot
atiord to back down now that he has gone
this tar. ta omer to keep his position in
Germany, he has to divert the attention of
the people to other things. The Jews fur-
nished his first arget. Then Austria, Now
Czechoslovakia. As long as he keeps the
Germans’ attention off himscli he is safe.
llowever, ( believe that this time he has
Litten otf more than he can chew.
Czechoslovakia has no small army. A
million men cannot be easily brushed aside.
especially sinee these men are deverained

-\lso. | imagine that [litter would feel right
uncomtortable ii, when his army was
marching against Czechoslovakia, Franee
shonld attack him from the other side. Eng -
land has put in her applieation to eater the
fight, and Russia is. on the waiting list.
These armies form a not unformidable op-
position. Mitler should not forget the
United States, either, because: although

that is judging irom his past record.

In his address Monday aiternoon, Hitler
said that the Sudeten was the last land he

two words seem very clearly to indieate to
me that now is the time for a showdown.

Our First Issue...

We of The Davidsonian staff were con-
siderably disappoimicd in our first issue.
(\ fell far short of-our expectations and of
the standard set. by past issues, It was
most. unfortunate that rush week and the
publication daic coincided, and most oi the
trouble can be traced to that cause.

The purpose of this editorial is, how-
ever, not to alibi. Beginning with this issue
we hope to cut out ail mistakes and to turn
out a paper that wili equal in ealtber that
which won an .ill-Ameriean ranking last
year. Again we want to solicit the co-
operation of the faculty and student body.
Perhaps you know some news item or ma-
tcrial for a feature story whieh may have
been overlooked. Ii so, please tell us about
it. No matter how trivial they may seem
to you, we weleomé any suggestions or |
criticisms and will try to promt by them.
But whatever you do, please don’t. criticize
and sneer at the paper behind our backs. |
Remember that a great deal of work is doae
by freshmen who have never had any news-
paper experience at all. Nearly alt colleges
which publish good papets haye a depart-
ment of journalism to do the editing and
managing. Sinee Davidson cannot attord -
such a departinent, we can only do our best |
under the cireumstanees. [1 you chink that
you can do better work than some of the
members of the stati, there is a place tor
you on it. That isnit just idle chatter
cither. We mean it.

We Apologize...

There ure two eputogies which we ieel
that. we owe and wish to make publicly. One
is tu Professor Metieachy, of the [listory
Department. Last week in the article
about the new professors his name Was |
carelessly omitied. Mr. Metieachy is a
Davidson graduate and took away with him
one of the highest scholastic averages ever
made here. fle then spent a vear studying
at the University of Nore Carolia and
three years at the University of Chieago.
le has completed ali the examinations for
his Ph.D. degree and is at present working
on his thesis.. *

The other is to the members of cur hen-
ovary athletic fraternity, Sigma Dele 1si
