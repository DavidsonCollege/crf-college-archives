results of the poll.

Although 54 percent of Da-
' vidson students will vote for
Ford, only 46 percent feel that
he will win. In contrast, 51
percent think that Carter will
win the election.

In the breakdown of Ford
and Carter’s support, the poll
indicates that 29 percent of

' Ford’s supporters feel that

Carter will actually win the
election. Only 12 percent of
Carter’s supporters feel that
Ford will win.

...club sports evaluated

[ Continued from page 1]
trying to establish is a func-

tioning board of club sports—
a stable‘sort of body to guide
the club sports in the future.’”’

Whatever sort of governing
body is established, one of its
main responsibilities will be to
establish a procedure and cri-
teria for the charter. of amy
new club sports.

Dietler’s committee is also
dealing with the matter of
financing for club sports, the
main issue being to decide
what the source of such funds
will be. It also must be
established as to who will be
responsible for the allocation
of these frunds and what the
allocation process will be.
Thom Cartmill, when asked if
the Athletic Department
would have a role in such
allocations, replied, ‘‘I have no
desire to control the club
sports budget.”’

Another area of committee
consideration is the extent to
which the club sports will be

able to make use of gymnasi-
um facilities such as the
training room. Currently, use
of the training room is re-
stricted to varsity sports with
club members only being
granted access for injuries
which require specialized care
such as whirlpool treatment.

Each club is responsible for
meeting its training needs and
providing any necessary first
aid equipment. The committee
is looking into the use of
trainers or qualified student
first_aiders—at_club_activities.
Several of the clubs which
engage in contact sports are
using their own funds to
establish medical boxes for
emergency situations.

Closely related to the issue
of adequate medical aid for the
club sports is that of insurance
coverage, which is alsq being
examined by Dietler’s com-
mittee. Currently, club sports
are covered by the comprehen-
sive student inusrance provid-
ed by the North American
Assurance Society of Virginia,

but as student participation in
club sorts increases nation-
wide, many insurance compa-
nies are beginning to group
clubs with varsity sports and
refusing to provide coverage.
College Business Manager
Robert Currie said, ‘‘Insur-
ance companies are taking a
second look at whether they
will cover club sports. Hope-
fully, North American-will
continue to provide such co-
verage for the club sportg.or,

The pool also analyzed the
percentage of out-of-state res-
idents who planned to vote by
absentee ballot. 82 percent
said they had already, or had
plans to vote in their home
states by absentee ballot.

This series of Presidential
polls has shown clearly the
wide base of support Gerald
Ford has on the D.C. campus.

But an independent poll
conducted among several fa-
culty members shows solid
(perhaps near 85 percent) sup-
port for the Democrat, Jimmy

Carter. All faculty members
were not polled so a definite
percentage cannot be accu-
rately calculated.

In view. of this and the
national and state-wide polls
giving Carter a clear edge in a
majority of states, the average
Davidson student, does remain
unique in giving such a olear
majority to President Ford.

The reasons for this support
has been explored in other
polls: Davidson students are
conservative, more fearful of
inflation than unemployment
and critical of Carter’s pro-
gressive reforms.

The primary role of Dietler’s
committee is to deal with the
current problems surrounding
club sports and to establish a
set policy for the future. Since
the beginning of this school
year, at the request of
Cartmill, the committee has
also been serving as an advi-
sory committee on club sports
to meet this year’s needs until
the Trustees can act on their
report.

This has mainly involved
the allocation of funds to the
clubs for this year. Cartmill
has been serving as ‘‘field
co-ordinator” in an effort to
resolve scheduling conflicts
which arise before a set policy
is established.

The club sports committee
has a lot of work ahead of it as
it seeks to determine the role
of the club sports in relation to
