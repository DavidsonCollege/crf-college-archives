The Bavidsantas

Coaches Favor Freshman Eligibility

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

Both the Davidson football
and basketball programs should
benefit greatly from a new

NCAA rule allowing freshmen
to play on those varsity teams.
At least this is the reaction
of the athletic department to

the new ruling, especially ath
letic director Tom Scott.

The new rule does away with
freshmen teams in football and
basketball and introduces a pro
gram of junior varsity programs
in their place. These teams
would be made up of players
in all classes, and would com-

pete in a special league, prob-
ably the equivalent of the var-
sity schedule.

“This system will give more
freedom to the coaches to train
the players,” Scott said, “by al-
lowing upperclassmen that may
not see much varsity action to
work on the JV and by allowing
exceptional freshmen to com-
pete on the varsity level.’

Cats Fall To Mounties, Pitt,

Cold streaks and colds took
their tolls on the Davidson cag
ers and cost them their past
two games against nonconfer
ence foes.

Riding on the crest of their
upset of national power St.
Johns and a 73 season score
card, the ‘Cats fell twice to
West Virginia 98-75 and to
Pittsburgh 91-78.

The Davidson scoring took a
sharp turn for the worse from
the previous ‘Cat victories.

In both games leading scorer
Joe Sutter shot below his aver
age, hitting 13 at Morgantown
and six against Pitt.

John Falconi was hampered
in the West Virginia game by
a severe cold, later diagnosed
as pneumonia, and did not even
dress for the Pittsburgh match.
He hit 14 at Morgantown.

In both games the ‘Cats held
the lead at one point during the
game.

Against West Virginia they
led by five points with about
five minutes left, but hit a cold
streak that cost them the game.
John Pecorak nit a jumper with
4:42 left in the game and the
Vildecats did not return to the
scoreboard until there were only
55 seconds remaining.

Although both Holland

some disagreement as to the
manner in which it should be

Holland said that he felt that
there should be some limits on
