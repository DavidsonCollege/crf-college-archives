Conflagration engulfs local legend

Hattie’s Bar and Grill is
gutted.

At two-thirty on Sunday
morning Davidson student
stopping to pick up his car at
Hattie’s noticed smoke coming
from a corner of the building.
Porc Larry Gagen, the
proprieter, and the Davidson,
Mount Mourne, Cornelius and
South Iredale fire departments
were soon alerted and on the
scene, with members of the
Davidson, Mecklenberg and
Iredell police departments.

The blaze was extinguished
by four-thirty, and resulted in
moderate damage, principally
to the. game room.: After con-
sulting insurance agents, the
police and fire departments,
Gagen, and onlookers left.

Fire flared again about nine-
thirty, however, resulting in the
return of all save the Iredell
firemen. This time the entire
building was ablaze, and the
fire fighters were hard put to
drown the blaze.

Police and firemen on the
seene found evidence of arson.
Shingles panelling the entire
building had been soaked in
kerosene, particularly where
the fire had originally begun. A
roll’ of tar. paper behind the

building had also been im-
-pregnated with kerosene.
“Arson’s definite,’’ said

Gagen. ‘‘Kerosene was the first
thing we smelled when we got
there,’’ added Chief of the
Mount Mourne Fire Depart-
ment Phifer John-
son.‘‘Everybody said the fire
looked like it’d been helped
along some.”

It seems debatable. whether
the second blaze was set, Gagen
believes that the fire was not
completely put out the first,time
and circulation within'the built:

up roof fanned the not-quite-
extinguished coals ‘into flames.

Phifer, however, feels that
the second~‘blaze, too, was
deliberate. ‘“You can tell when a
fire’s had a little help,” he
asserted. ‘This one did. If a
fire’s left to itself it’ll pretty
much burn in its own area. But
this one looked like it’d had
some help.”’

Firemen encountered dif-
ficulties in entering the flat-
roofed structure, as doors were
locked and'windows nailed shut.

“With a building like that a
fire’s almost impossible to put
out,’’ said Phifer. ‘‘Under a flat
roof it’s got nowhere to go and
the roof’ll fall in.”’

The fire leaves Larry Gagen
without a business’ and
Davidson College without a
long-enjoyed and long-
convenient tradition. Gagen,
who bought Hattie’s two and
half years ago from Hattie
Bumgarner, said he has ‘‘No
idea’ when, or even if, he will
be able to rebuild.

“After puttting it out the first
time we’d found it only
damaged the game room,”’ he
said. ‘“‘We had the insurance
agent down and figured
damages at about $5,000 to
$6,000. We took a real financial
loss after the second : fire,
though. I’ve got no idea of the
total,but it’ll be about $30,000
after insurance.”

“I don’t know if we’re going to
be coming back bigger and
better than ever, but looking at
it realistically I can’t say
anything now. I’m still trying to
sort everything out.”

Some accessories Gagen
would: have to replace under
reconstruction could eost him
as much as ten times the. in-

‘surance he willreceiveonthem.

Gagen was planning an ex-

“pansion of the building and’ had

“and even

just completed the paperwork
for small-business assistance
from NCNB when the fire broke
out.

Asked who he thought might
have set the fire. Gagen:replied,

f don’t know. I really don’t
jhave any idea. But over two
and a half years I’ve made a lot
of enemies. I didn’t think the
place was much when I bought
it and I oriented my business
towards the college.

“There were some. people-I
can call them rednecks--who got
drunk and rowdy and I had to
throw them out. People I can
cawant in there I told so.”

“The fire department says its
impossible to say who did it
unless you catch them in the act
then the judicial
process leaves room for second-
guessing. Most people get away
with it.”

Part of the loss Gagen feels is
in the cessation of com-

munication with' the coHege  f

community. ‘‘It’s been very
satisfying for me,” he said. ‘‘We
had a good relation with
students, what faculty I met,
and just people. I’m going to
miss the hell out of it.”

Gagen intends to write the
Davidson community a letter
explaining his feelings about the
fire and its repercussions. It will
appear-in the Davidsonian

“under letters to the editor.
At Davidson College, reaction

to the blaze has been a collected
“What the hell are we going to
do for the rest of the year?”
Perhaps the best answer .was
given by a passing voice in the
hall: |‘‘We’ll probably end up
driving down and sitting in th

ashes for a couple of hours on
Thursdays. We sure aren’t
going to study.”’ _

Grill for a good while now.
There is only a shell of a
building left. The boarded-over
windows have been knocked out
by firemen’s axes; the doors
likewise. Inside,from bar to
benches, is a sludge of water,

ashes and half-burnt wood. Pink
insulation hangs from the bit of

false ceiling which has not
collapsed; outside it peeks from
under charred shingles.

Surprisingly enough, there
are still blackened bottles and
cans of Rolling Rock, Bud-
weiser and Miller High Life in
the open fridge. But Hatties is
quiet.
