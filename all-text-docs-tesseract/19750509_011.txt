Eleven

Humanities confronts IMAC : st pe

By PAUL BANTA
and ALAN EDMUNDS

This column deals with one of

the most bizarre and unex-
pected phenomena ever to oc-
cur here at Davidson, Joe Dun-
‘can leading a Humanities
discussion.

Maybe, to some of you fresh-
meh, this doesn’t seem strange,
for every Humes student is ex-
pected to give of himself in this
fashion. But what we’re dealing
with is not the normal
Humanities student, no, for the
beloved Y.B, is more than just a
Humes student, he is an in-
stitution. _

Many. times has a_ bored
Humes: student looked across
the discussion table and seen
that Smiling face which masks a
. malignant disregard for
Humanities... Be wary of this
friendly and lovable sort, for
he’s selling the lowest vice;
pure, uncut underachievement.

If infected with his odious
form of poison, the victim sinks
into an unescapeable morass,
from ‘which recovery is
unlikely, the withdrawal pains
insurmountable.

Almost without warning,
Duncan appears in Humes
discussion, armed not with con-
summed great works or reams
of notes, but with a saber-like
wit, and a vocabulary of curse
words as awesome as Buckley’s
polysyllabic vocabulary.

Largely unappreciated by
pompous professors and limp
library rats, Duncan adds a
unique flair and color to any
discussion, but to ask this man,
this tower of disrespect, to lead
a discussion is akin to asking
Willie Sulton to guard your bank
or asking Marv Throneberry to
be a defensive replacement at
first.

His installation as discussion
leader seems to beg for the
destruction of the group as an
academic entity. Attention
must be paid. When great cities
fall, and mighty civilizations
‘crumble, there are always
those. brave few who stay
behind, disregarding their own
safety to record for posterity
the collapse of the old guard.

Like Ernest Hemingway in
Spain, or Ed Bradley in Saigon,

Driving the golden spike

or even Davidson’s own Dr.
McGeachy, who recorded: the
last days of Pompeii and the
Roman defeat at Adrianople;
inspired by the bravery of these
men, I took it upon myself to at-
tend this apparent conflict bet-
ween an immovable object and
an irresistible force.

But the memory of the Young

Buck lingers on, and
somewhere in the cosmos his
ethereal spirit is happy,

knowing that down here some
people were still practicing his

favorite avocation, IMAC
sports.

The crowning glory of the
IMAC season, the track meet,
was held this week. Davidson’s
amateurs presented a challenge
to the U.S. Olympic Committee,
for even if our sprinters aren’t
fast enough to win, they are at
least smart enough to show up
on time.

The Delts were favored to win
the team crown, and so they

did. Because of this, most of the .

attention was directed to the in-
dividual championships.

Chris Young took the 100 in an
impressive 10.4. He also cap-
tured the 220, but most of the
eyes were on Howard Payne
and John Swanson, the anti-
semitic duo, and their $1, win-
ner take nothing showdown,
which Swanson won with a 26.2,
impressive for a_ left-fielder
with the range of a drowsy
woolly mammoth.

The 120 and 220 hurdles were
dominated by John Perry, the
440 by Rick Miller, and the 880
was won by Bob Jacobs with a
rather pedestrian 2:16, Jesse
Smith won the mile with a 4:54,

casting further aspersions upon
the 880 field.

dling the distance.
