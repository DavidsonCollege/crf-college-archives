Grosch Exhibit Is A Celebration Of Life

By DR. FRANK BLISS

Special to The Davidsonian

During one of the many times
I have visited Laura Grosch’s
show in Chambers Gallery I said
to myself, “If I review these mar-
velous acrylics I will not use any
of the terms you so often read and
hear when an experience of art is
put into words.” Something like
that, anyway, suggests what I said
to myself. And then I felt as if my
eyes were actually feasting, as
they moved from one image to
another, and on to another, linger-

ing over each one. I thought that
each acrylic—especially the later
ones, from the early ’80s into this
year—is dynamic: vigorous, full
of energy, forceful. Looking
again at one of my favorites, Eden
Now: Marigolds and Monarchs
(1984), I delighted in the bold col-
ors and remembered the brave
works of Georgia O’ Keeffe.

And then I thought of how
much is abstracted from the

flower, or butterfly, in its natural
environment when its image is
created on canvas or on paper (of

Célebrating Bach's 300th Birthday

Welsh Presents The Catechism’ At Spring, Vespers Concert

By BILL BUGG

Davidson College music pro-
fessor Wilmer Welsh performed
Bach's “The Catechism” at the
Davidson College Presbyterian
Church for Sunday evening's
Vesper Concert. Commemorating
Johann Sebastion Bach on the
300th anniversary of his birth,
Welsh played the organ master-
piece with great discipline and ex-
pressiveness.

“The Catechism” consists of
various preludes and other hymns
for the organ. Modeled after six of
Luther's chorales on the articles of
faith in his Catechisms, the giant
work is divided into two settings,
one large and one small for each
chorale. Bach preceded the six
chorales with two sections of pre-
ludes, the Kyrie and the Gloria,
both of which consist of large and
small settings. He then framed the
work with his Prelude and Fugue
in E-flat Major.

Welsh performed the large
and small settings on two different
organs. In an interview, Welsh
stated that the smaller organ pro-
vides an intimate, introspective

answer to the larger, more majes-
tic-sounding organ. “The two in-
struments carry across... the
dual nature of the work,” he said,
and.added that two organs provide
more variety.

Throughout the organ master-
piece, special motives symbolize
doctrines of faith. The opening
prelude, an extended French over-
ture, sets the stage for worship of
God in what some Bach scholars
call the majesty motive. Welsh il-
luminated the motive with great
expression.

The next selection, the Kyrie,

is divided into three large settings ,
and three small settings. The large

setting is the first of a series of re-
ferences to the Trinity. Not only is
the setting broken into three parts
symbolizing the Trinitarian doc-
trine “One in three and three in
one,” but the climax of each part
contains three voices, the top rep-
resenting the Father, the middle
the Son, and the bottom the Holy
Ghost. The Gloria is broken into
three sections for the same sym-
bolic reason. The first setting is a
small organ motet of three voices,

Cactus is on paper; the other eight

how fine it is to be able to look
long and closely in a comfortable,
air-conditioned room at unchang-
ing images from the natural
world. Such works as Laura
Grosch’s enable you to see much
more perceptively when you re-
turn to the outdoors, especially at
this time of year, when the full-
ness of spring is almost with us.
Laura Grosch’s show is a de-
light; it is a joyous celebration of
life, of living, of the vibrant col-
ors, the patterns, the vitality of our
world. Look at the oranges, the
yellows, the reds, the greens.
Look at the different backgrounds
and see how each is appropriate to
the dominant form or pattern. Be-
come aware of Laura’s develop-
ment; notice how different the ac-
rylic from the late '60s (White
Daffodil Diptych, 1969) is from
those of the ’80s, such as Eden
Now: Poinsettias and Tiger Swal-
lowtails, 1985. Stand toward the
front of the Gallery, in the middle
of the room, and look at all nine
acrylics; let your eyes flow from
one harmony to another, from
Cactus through Zinnias, to the

tails again. Then walk up close to
look at the details, the techniques
used, and to drink in the colors.

I used harmony above deliber-
ately. Her works aren't just pleas-
ing arrangements; Grosch's im-
ages sing. They sing in the sense
that they are expressions of joy,
joyous responses to natural shapes
and tones and colors and textures
and patterns, joyous creations of
shapes and tones and colors and

the second is in triple meter, and
the — third three-voiced
fughetta.

The first of Bach's renditions
of the six Lutheran chorales is the
Decalogue, “These Are the Holy
Ten Commands.” The tune, di
vided into five sections, is re-
peated twice, symbolizing the Ten
Commandments. The second of
the Lutheran Chorales, the Creed.
is a fugue of three voices. The os-
tinato appears seven times at the
bottom of the texture, perhaps
representing each article of faith
in the Nicene Creed. The ostinato
includes Bach's faith motive, a
series of ascending leaps and fall-
backs depicting the human strug-
gle of reaching up to God only to
fall back into sin.

The third of the six chorales ts
the Lord's Praver. The large set-
ting contains Bach's grief motive,
a sighing Lombard rhythm which
painfully cries out, “Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.” The small set-
ting includes an alternation of as-
cending bass and descending tre-
ble patterns, symbolizing God's

Look again at the different
backgrounds in the different
works; compare White Daffodil
Diptych and Cymbidium Orchids
to Sha. Look at the uses of con-
trast, and of negative space; look
at the images, the forms. These
are works to be viewed again and
again, to be lived with, works to
delight in and to be grateful for.
