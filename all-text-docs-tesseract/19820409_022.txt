From the Recruiter’s Car

So you thought 1982 NCAA basket-
ball ended’ on Bourbon St.?: And you
thought Davidson basketball ended long
before ‘that? In a sense, yes. But not
quite. .

In-just a few days high school stars
across the nation will sign-letters of in-
tent, and you’d better believe it’s part of
basketball season. This crazy world of
recruiting goes on long past the season
per se, but rarely do we hear about it un-
til players sign. Well, no more. had the
chance to hit the road with Gerry Vail-
lancourt, and en route he helped shed
some light on his world of chuckles and
grins.. ©

Q:You travel an awful lot of miles. How
do you pass the time?

A:You try to do little things—like, I try
to rate the hot chocolates at different
places.

Q:Whar' s got the best rating.so far?
A:Oh, so far .McDonald’s.
number one right now. The number one
coffee is Dunkin’ Donuts, but 7-11’s is

pushing a close second. You do little.

mind games with yourself while you’re
dtiving.

Hotel selection is key. Although
blessed with a great budget, we try to

save money every place we go, but if.
you can get a great deal on.a room that -

has ESPN, by all means ‘you’ have to

take it, because then you can watch bas-..

ketball games until your eyes fall out! If

you have Home Box and ESPN, that is a.

double bubble. That means you are.
really in.

That’s —

Q:What are some embarassing situa-
tions you’ ve run into?

_A:One time I went to say hello to a guy

and called him by the wrong name. But
he wasn’t.a player. It was some coach.
He corrected me, but it wasn’t so bad
because he kept calling me Paul all
night.

Q:What’s the strangest. thing you' ve ev-
er._run into?

A:With all the traveling you do, some-
thing is bound to happen sometimes.
One time I was in a hotel and I fell as-
leep. About four o’clock in the morning
there’s somebody opening my. hotel
room door. I’ve got the chain on the
door so he couldn’t get in, but I hear da-
boom, da-boom, da-boom trying to op-
en the door. There Iam. having visions
of Coach Found Dead in Hotel Room,
and I jump up, put my foot on the door,
and slam it closed on this guy’s hand.

He starts screaming. I’m yelling, “What

do you want?” but not that politely—I
kicked in a few street adjectives. And”
the guy’ s screaming, “What are you do-: ae)
ingin my room?” This is kind o y at” Avi

four o’clock in the morning!

As it turned out, the girl at the desk 7

registered me for a room, but gave me
the key to another room. And.the man-

; ager’ § out in the hall with this guy figur-
-ihg somebody might have snuck into the
room. That scared me to death.

Q:Any other, fears?

A:I think ‘the: greatest fear an assistant -
coach. has traveling on the road is the”

late night flat tire atlases T think any

coach in the country would agree with
that. It’s one of the Top 10fears. Anoth-

er is hitting a bump while you're drink: .

ing hot coffee.

Q:What’s your philosophy of recruit-
ing?

A-First of all, our philosophy of recruit-

ing is based on what Coach Hussey ;

likes. He [a recruit] has to get into Da-
vidson, and be a player that we feel will
academically survive at Davidson.
Q:About how many players out of the
average high school class does that
knock out?

A:We knock out about seven out of ten.
Right away you know who you can re-
cmiit, so you won't waste any time. We
wanna recruit people with good atti-
tudes, people’ who believe .in’ over-
achieving, and people who will fit‘into
our system.

Q:De you have @ hard time sling Da
vidson? a

A: Well, academically the name David.
-’ sitting in an airport waiting for a plane,

-son.will get us in the door, *

ead ereRe ss

[get
” player: Because: we are. Davidson. Now

that -has-a plus and it has a drawback. -
- The plus i is you'll get into.a player’ $ top

6 or top 8 ‘only, because you’re David-
son, because it carries some prestige.

Q:You mean people have heard.of Da-
vidson?.

A:Oh yeah. We will get. involved witha
player because we are Davidson. Now
that has a‘plus and it has a drawback.

‘You mean B peoite hav We heagd, of Da:
2% , you do this? Why are you’

The plus is you’ll get into a player’s top
6 or top 8 only because you’re David-
son, because it carries some prestige.
The drawback about it is if we get in-
volved with a player that only wants.to
be involved with Davidson just so he
can-say he was recruited by one of the
best academic schools in the country.
_ We-really have to read his interest.

Q:But Coach—why do you go through

all this?
A:The outsider doesn’t undérstand.
This is our life—this is what we like.
We like our job. Of course it’s work, but
it’s not the type of work that’s killing
you. It’s a turn-on. How many people
can say that about their jobs? .
It’s a job suited for me bécause it’s a

_ Job where you deal with péople and you

get to run your mouth, andJ love to run
my mouth. My eyes sometimes have the
tendency to start turning brown...

Don’t get me wrong—there are
times—3 o’clock in the: morning, I'll be

and you say to yourself, “Well why do
out there go-
ing all over the country,,and you're
looking for players and you’ re coaching
and you’re getting so excited about what.
people say is just a game?” And I tell
myself when:you sit back'and relax and
you think about it, it’s because I love it.

‘People come up to me-and say, “How

can you do that?” It's 's because—I love
it. 3
