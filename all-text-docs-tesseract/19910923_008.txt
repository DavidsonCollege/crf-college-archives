Honor

continued from page 6
of incompetence and lack of faith in the
student body are mostly made by present
council members afraid of losing their
positions.

Others say, if it’s not broken ther
don’t fix it. Sull, Davidson should not be
afraid to re-evaluate its honor system an¢
make changes which would give hore
students a greater sense of connection

with their own honor. The large number ;
of students present at an open trial last {
month makes me feel thatthere arealotol -
people in the community who wanttopar- ;
ticipate in the system but are shut out by {

our elective process. The long list of
candidates in the Dean of Students’ office
for the upcoming election also points tc
this desire. Let us not be so irresponsible
that we let a few people make all of the
decisions in honor trials. A self-selectec
jury pool would put the honor system ir
the hands of more students, eliminate some
of the negativeness associated with the
current system, and bring more student:
closer to their own sense of honor. We are
all part of the honor system at Davidsor
and each us of should have a say in its op:
eration.

I propose that the SGA hold a forur
on student and faculty opinion of the hono:
system and create a questionnaire for stu-
dents to make suggestions for a bette:
judicial system.
