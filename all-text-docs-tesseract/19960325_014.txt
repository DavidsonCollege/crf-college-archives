Kruse’s Cubby:

Anarchy
reigns
supreme

By MICHAEL KRUSE

Assistant Sports Editor

This weekend, I trekked to
Atlanta for the NCAA East Re-
gional.

While UMass won an all-
expenses-paid vacation to ex-
otic New Jersey with its 86-62
dismantling of Georgetown, Lee
“One of a” Kynes, my basket-
ball-watching buddy and
Thursday’s chauffeur, paid a
bum $5 for parking.

Yup, we parked in just any
old lot in Ted Turner’s Magic
Kingdom and the guy came up
to good ol’ unsuspecting Lee.

“Yo, fih-dollah,” he blurted.

Lee, in a pathetically futile
effortto be streetsmart, requested
aticket confirming the deal. He
got a random pink piece of pa-
per. The slick bum got five
dollars richer.

But then again, what’s an-
other five bucks when visiting
the peachy Georgia Dome, home
of the three-buck souvenir cup.

Inacollege student’s finan-

cial realm, three bucks means a
meal.
Speaking of getting gypped,
the friendly Baker Sports Com-
plex briggade has decided to
destroy Belk Arena and then re-
build it just in time for June.

Good thing they decided to
do that now so that the courts
will be rip, roarin’, and ready to
go by the time all the students
leave.

$25,000, and we can’t even
play basketball. Baker’s pretty
carpet rocks the much-maligned
library carpet’s house, but that
doesn’t change the fact that it
closes at ten on weeknights,
whereas the library stays open
until 1 a.m. And 3 a.m. during
exams! Over Spring Break,
Baker opened from noon til 2
p.m. Two hours. Why bother?

Anarchy.

My crystal Pizza Hut
Rawlings Game Ball sees a
streetball revolution, possibly
bloody, soon taking over
Davidson College.

And that’s notthe only thing
my trusty crystal Ball predicts.
Presenting my final four picks:
the Syracuse “Wallace”
Orangemen beat the Miss. St.
“What’s wrong with this pic-
ture?” Bulldogs in the undercard
before the Kentucky “It’s al-
most too easy” Wildcats outlast
the UMass “Why are we playing
these guys on Saturday” Min-
utemen in the feature presenta-
tion-an epic heavyweight battle.

Prepare yourself.

Pastel dominates the hardcourts

By TyYLerR Epp

As the men’s tennis team pow-
ers into conference play, sopho-
more Jon Pastel, the Wildcats’ top
singles player, is quietly having
one of the best years in Davidson
tennis history.

After posting an 8-3 mark in
the fall tournament season, Pastel
has dominated this spring, already
tallying eleven wins with twelve
matches to go.

“Tt has been a great start so
far,” Pastel said, “I have had an
opportunity to play some of the

best players in the nation this year, .

but there’s still a lot of tennis left to
play.”

Pastel’s performances against
North Carolina’s All-American
David Caldwell and South
Carolina’s Keith Brill turned some
heads and established Pastel’ s repu-
tation as one of the Southeast’s
premier players.

Pastel’s fall campaign mer-
ited a regional ranking of 29, but
after knocking off a number of
players ahead of him this spring,
he expects a spot in the top 20 by

‘the end of this year.

“Jon’s mental toughness and
tenacity have been two of his great-
est assets throughout his two years
here in the Davidson program,”
said coach Jeff Frank.

In addition to Pastel’s singles
prowess, he is fast becoming one
of the Southern Conference’s most
respected doubles players. He and
senior co-captain Bill Mitchem
have combined to posta 5-1 record
this spring, including a victory
over the nation’s ninth-ranked tan-
dem.

“Jon is a phenomenal player,
especially for being only 5’6”,”
Mitchem said.

In addition to gaining the
league’s and nation’s attention,
Pastel has earned respect from his
teammates and coaches.

Jon is a great example on and
off the court,” teammate Ted
Kaplan said, “His dedication to
the game and his team are truly
admirable.”

Assistant coach Bryce Plott
agreed, “The sky is the limit for a
player of his caliber.”

With Pastel leading, the fu-
ture of Wildcat tennis looks espe-
cially bright.

young talent,” Pastel said, “There
is no limit to how far this team can

”

go.

Pastel is also closing in on
fifty career singles wins, putting
himself in a position to break Bill

Young’s mark of 112.

“Jon Pastel represents the class
and dignity of Davidson tennis,”
said Frank, “His work ethic and
determination define what it means
to be a Wildcat.”

Wildcats end slide

. By Kevin ZVARGULIS

Despite Luke Goodwin’ s team-
leading .400 average, baseball had
lost eight straight until stopping the
skid this weekend by taking two of
three from conference foe Furman.

On Tuesday, defending North-
ernIvy League Champion Yale was
in town. The game began auspi-
ciously as Davidson scored six runs
in the first inning. The slugfest was
far from over though. Yale ex-
ploded for seven runs in the sev-
enth to take an 11-8 lead.

Davidson answered in the bot-
tom of the inning with five runs of
their own, only to lose the game 15-
13 in the ninth when Yale scored
four times. For Davidson, Gus
Quattlebaum and Brad Edwards
each had three hits and three RBIs,
while Anderson Marvin chipped in
two hits and three RBI’s including
a three run home run.

The team tried to bounce back
against former Davidson head coach
George Greer and Wake Forest on

Wednesday. Davidson had al-
ready defeated Wake Forest once
this season in a dramatic ninth
inning comeback. But, Wake For-
est ran away with this game 14-3.

Davidson ended its winless
streak in the second game of
Saturday’s double header against
Furman.

In the first game Davidson
fell behind early and was unable
to recover. Despite a three run
eighth inning the Wildcats even-
tually lost 7-4.

Davidson dominated the sec-
ond game, ending their skid deci-
sively. The offense posted 14
runs and Chris Pollard (4-3) al-
lowed 1 run on the mound for the
lopsided victory. The middle of
the order combined for nine hits
and nine RBIs including four from
Jeff Coker.

The Wildcats went on to win
Sunday’s game by a score of 8-7.
They jumped to an early lead and
Rhett Ingerick’s (2-2) solid seven-
inning pitching performance held
off the Paladins.

Casner plays tough

‘By CARLO REYNOLDS

Staff Writer

Dana Casner did not expect to
play first seed on the women’s
tennis team as a freshman.

“One weekend after [Christ-
mas] break, the coach called me in
and told me [I would play #1]; I
was very happy,” she says.

Casner says that she has had to
give her tennis game greater prior-
ity than she did in high school in
Coral Springs, Florida.

“I’ve always played tennis
seriously, but:in high school, ten-
nis came second to school,” she
reflects. “Now, I really have to do
both. Whenever I don’t have ten-
nis, I am studying.”

The freshman credits her col-
lege success to increased practice
and competition, but she also says
she is pieying | better than she ever
has. :

She is 7-3 in singles and 9-5 in
doubles with freshman Amber
Bradford (who also plays #2
singles) as a partner. The #4 and
#6 spots are also occupied by fresh-
man.

Playing other school’s more
experienced, top-ranked women

does not bother Casner. Much of
the time, other Davidson players
can tell her what to expect. But
when she competes with women
she knows nothing about, she does
not feel as if it is a disadvantage.

“Last week, no one knew any-
thing, and I had to just go in and see
what would happen,” Casner says.

Unlike some competitive ten-
nis players, Casner does not rely
onemotion and momentum to carry
her through difficult matches.

Against especially tough op-
ponents Casner admits that she uses
emotion to help her, but day to day,
she says that preparation is more
important.

“Tt really depends on who I’m
playing and where I’m playing. .
Having one good win gives you
more confidence, but you’re not
going to play better consistently
because of it,” she states.

Over Spring break, Casner had
what she considers her best win of
the year when Davidson played
James Madison. ;

“Td heard a lot about who I
was playing. She was supposedly
ranked well in juniors, and I’d seen
her play. It was a very good win,”
Casner says with a smile.
