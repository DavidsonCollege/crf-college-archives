INTERESTING TALK
BY MLLE. CLEMONT
HEARD BY STUDENTS

(Continued from page 5)
Berjson’s teachings have affected the thoughts
of peoples of every nation, and that his in-
fluence can be seen in the progress of the
arts and sciences, :

Anatole France, another of the leaders of
thought in France, has been known inter-
nationally as an author of the highest rank.
His works are expressive of the lives of the
average intellectual Frenchman, and are full
of mild satire and keen humor. This author
is an admirer of the sincerity of the com-
mon people, and his masterpieces are full of
portrayals of their lives. He is a Socialist,
and his entire sympathy is with these peoples.

A characteristic of the scientific genuises
of the French nation is that they are totally
disinterested in the wealth that their discov-
eries might bring them. They believe that
thoughts of money make them lose their
peace of mind, and take away considerable of
their inventive and explorative ability,

Pasteur, Monsieur and Madame Curie, who
have all given something of inestimable value
to the world as well as having brought much
credit to their country.

Thus we can see that France, the nation to
which we are accustomed to look as the na-
tion of pleasure, and gaiety, is giving to the
world now, as she has given in the past, men
of- great intellect and ability, that;have in-
fluenced the world more than can be realized
with their revelations and discoveries in the
fields of science and philosophy.

operate the coal mines.” This query,
which was probably the best debated one
of the year in the society, is the question
for the intercollegiate debate with the
' University of Pittsburgh. The speakers
for the affirmative were Don Stewart and
3ill Covington, while the negative side
was upheld by E. T. Pullen and H. J.
‘Powell. The judges decided two to one
in favor of the affirmative. Each of
these. men ‘are going out forthe inter-
collegiate debating teams and promises
fair to make a place. Other Metrophil-
ians out for intercollegiate debating are
Roland Parker, Roland Sims and LL, D.
Wharton.

The query for the Sewanee debate,
“Resolved: That the military forces of
the United States should be consolidated
‘into department of national defense, |
with branches of army, navy, and air
forces,” which is also the query for the
Freshman team, will be used at the meet-
ing tonight, Thursday, February 11th.

Eumenean
At the last meeting of the Eumenean
Society, A. Y. Bowie gave a splendid talk
on the subject, “An -Open Mind.” Be-
cause of the fact that several members
/ were on the Glee Club, the current events
and the declamation were left out. The

_ debate, “Resolved, that the United States ,
Among the leading of the scientists are |

should own and operate the coal mines,” |
was, however, very spirited. The affir- |
mative speakers were T. G. McCutcheon |
‘and W. H. Linch; the negative speakers
were W. C. Ogden and F. G. Daniel. A
motion was made and seconded that the
| three oil stoves, which were used before
{the heating system was installed, be
| given to a country church several miles
| from Davidson.

i

Pandeinic

At last week’s meeting of the Pandenic
Society, the officers were installed and
‘the regular program. was also carried
out. J. M. Garrison gave a talk on “Why
men alone speak.” The subject of the!
debate was, “Resolved, that the United |
| States should own and operate the coal
mines.” J. C. Moore and S. W. Moore
,took the affirmative side and G. E. |
|land-and R. H. Mellwaine took the neg-
ative. The declamation was given by W. |
|K. Pritchett andthe current events by
W. M. Greverton.

For the remainder ofthe year the soci- |
ety will probably devote its time to the |
“discussion of topics of particular interest, |
{just as they are discussed in Congress. |
No assignments will be given. The mem- |
bership will probably be divided into |
Whigs and Tories, one side to support |
and the other to oppose the bills wiichi|
are brough up. The bill for discussion |
| for the following week will be presented,
at cach meeting. The bill for this week, ,
| whichis the same as the V. P. I, debate,
is Resolved: “That the army, navy and
air forces should all be combined.

led with 17 points; Laird had 12. Four shots
were Laird’s specialty that-evening, the cap-
| tain getting four points out of four tries.

Captain Smith, of the Quakers, seemed
{most aggressive of the visitors, while the
other forward, Ferrell, and the center,
| Moore, were almost equal sharers in scoring
jhonors. The defense work of Smith made
jthe final count for Davidson be diminished
| somewhat.
| It was one of the cleanest games on the
|court, flashy the majority of the time, and
played with a rapidity that exceeded other
performances of cage quints at Davidson.

‘Lecturer’s Books
May Be Purchased
At Y.M.C.A. Office

tures last week-end will be glad to learn

his most forceful lectures may be secured

One of the lectures is entiled The |
Christ-Spirit in the Animal World, and
is dedicated tothe Fundamentalists and
the, Modernists. A quotation from the

lecture will show its general

“The sabre-toothed tiger is gone, but the

nature:

sheep and cattle on a thousand hills re-

main in millions. The hyena and the
jaguar skulk in their loneliness, but the
noble horse abounds, It, is not scripture
but science: “Blessed are meek, and the
brotherly, and they practice Mutual Aid
—for they shall inherit the earth.” |

The other pamphlet contains two lec-

tures in regard to the Church, The Mili=
tant Church and Property, and, The Mili- |
tant Church and Public Opinion, Among
other great statements this book pro- |
claims “Only moral and spiritual and|
social radicals like Socrates, and Jesus, |
and Fox and Wesley have ever been able
to reanscend a public opinion created by
the moral code and mental grip of a

dominant economic class in any particu-

lar period of history. And we of our

day are no exception tothe rule.”

| ‘These pamphlets are on sale in the of-
‘fice of A. M. Hillhouse, the price being

fifteen cents for either pamphlet, twenty-
five cents for both.
