A lot of us were starting to wonder
whatever happened to these guys.

So when Eddie from Ohio returned
to the College Union last Monday night
after a two-year absence, scores of jun-
iors and seniors flocked to the 900 Room
to hear Davidson’s favorite acoustic
folk group perform once again. The
band looked exactly the same — the
lead guitarist was still bald, and the
bassist still bore a striking resemblance
to Christoper Lloyd.

Many curious underclassmen also
took in the show.

Eddie from Ohio is not from Ohio,
but rather from Northern Virginia. They
are comprised of drummer Eddie
Hartness, Julie Murphy Wells (vocals,
tambourine), Robbie Schaefer (guitar,
vocals), and Michael Clem (guitar, bass,
harmonica, vocals).

ing from their jangly brand of acoustic

harmonies were marked by astonishing
clarity and precise intonation from each
of its four members. It was clear to see

sound. Hartness even offered a five-
minute bongo solo towards the. middle
of the performance. The group’s vocal

that unlike so many “college bands,”
this one had raw talent.
Although the band was met with a

sturdy contingent of listeners through-
out, the performance was particularly
popular with those of the upperclass-
man variety, who took quickly to unin-
hibited dancing.

The songs represented work from
all four of Eddie from Ohio’s albums,
including several from their newest re-
lease. As expected, they did not fail to
perform the infamous “One man’s grace
is another man’s hell” song.

EFO gives performances _year-

‘round and nation-wide, from New York

to Colorado, but make it home in time
to play a gig every Tuesday night atBad
Habits Grille in Alexandria, Va.

Eddie from Ohio seems to be on a
slow yet perpetual climb in the music
world, so we can expect-to hear from
them again at some point in the future.
They welcomed us all home from
Thanksgiving break in fine fashion, of-
fering an enjoyable study break, just in
time for the pre-exam crunch.

Mortal Kombat II: annihilate this!

By Ep ANDERSON
Staff Writer

Mortal Kombat is a tournament
that determines the fate of the people of
the Earth. Every century, a portal opens,
connecting Earth to the Outworld(which
makes us the Inworld, I guess). A series
of one-on-one fights between contes-
tants from both worlds determines the
overall champion, who represents his
world. If one side wins ten times ina
row, they can send in their armies and
take over the other realm. All of this is
controlled by the Elder Gods, who prob-
ably do this to get their jollies.

In the first Mortal Kombat. film,
Liu Kang, a descendent of the Lin Kuei
fighting monks was Earth’s champion.
He defeated Shang Tsung, a sorcerer
from Outworld who had rigged the tour-
nament in an attempt to take over the
Earth realm. Though Shang Tsung was
defeated and turned into a really gross
pile of dust, his commander, Shao Kahn,
lived on in the Outworld. Shao Kahn

killed the emperor of the Outworld,’

taking his place with the Queen Sindel,
and her daughter, Princess Kitana.
Queen Sindel kills herself out of grief
for her dead husband, and also because
it was the only way she could get men-
tioned in the first movie.

Kitana managed to escape the
Outworld and fell in love with Liu Kang,
despite the fact that she is 10,000 years
old and he is 20-something. Together,
along with a special forces agent seek-
ing revenge named Sonya Blade and a
Kung Fu film star out for glory named
Johnny Cage, they represent the forces
of good. Overseeing their effort is

Rayden, a demigod of lightning who is
sympathetic to the mortals of Earth
because he covets their anti-static cling
magic dryer sheets.

At the end of the first movie, Liu
and the others have defeated Shang
Tsung, but Shao Kahn has found a way
to send his armies of death, destruction,

gooders noticing that the sky has just
ripped open, and it is raining black-clad
ninjas. Far more disturbing than the
impending evil, however, are the cast-
ing choices for the lead roles in the new
movie.

First and foremost, Rayden, the
god of thunder who was originally por-

° Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, in-theatres everywhere

and anti-fun to destroy the Earth any-
way. As the sequel begins, we discover
that somehow Queen Sindel has been
resurrected, but is not all sunshine and
light like-she used to be. In fact, she is
helping Shao Kahn send in his armies,
and laughing at the silly mortals as she
crushes them under her boot.

From the opening scene, knew
something was amiss. Picking up right
where the first movie left off, the sequel
begins with the entire MK band of do-

trayed by Christopher Lambert, known
worldwide for his starring movie role as
Connor McLeod, the Highlander, has
been replaced. The schmoe they put in
his place was origirially cast as Johnny
Cage, and is really not appropriate for
the role of a sage demi-god. As far as I
am concerned, “There can be only one!”
Then again, after seeing what happens
to Rayden in this movie, I would have
turned down the part, too.

Since they had to use the actor they

hired for Johnny Cage’s part as Rayden,
they went ahead and hired another actor
for the part of Johnny Cage, and then
killed him off in the first thirty seconds
of the movie, sacrificing himself to save
Sonya Blade. This is supposed to mo-
tivate Sonya to kill and destroy evil, and
to avenge the death of her boyfriend,
but by the end of the movie, she’s
forgotten about him, as has most of the
audience.

Consider the first pivotal scene.
Liu Kang and Princess Kitana have
been instructed by
the Hopi Desert in Arizona to contact
Nightwolf, a Native American warrior/
sorcerer who will help them in the fight
against Shao Kahn. To get there, pre-
sumably from Tibet, where all the hip
monks are, they use these giant metal
ball-cages. It’s kinda like a cross be-
tween the subway, that thing at the
drive through bank teller that takes your
checks and gives you lollipops, and one

of those gyro things that everyone tells ~

you won’t make you sick, but you still
see kids losing five or six pounds of
lunch at Space Camp after they get out
of it. These things, which for-clarity_I
will refer to as “ball-thingies,” suppos-
edly run off of some kind of geothermal
power, and can jet you to anyplace in
the world in hours. The downside is
that you have to more or less hug the
other person the entire time, which
would be great, except that you also
have to pay attention to steering the
ball-thingy, which you do by shifting
your weight.

Considering that these kids are “in
