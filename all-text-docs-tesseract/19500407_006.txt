predicted that a change would not
produce better officers but would
create fraternity blocks among the
large fraternities on the campus and
hamper an independent candidate's
chances of election rather than help-

outline of the specific changes to
be made in the constitution by the
affirmative, which the affirmative
team was unable to produce. This
seems to have been the decisive
factor in the decision, which was
given to the negative team.

The nearness of the elections
seemed to have awakened every-
one’s attention to just what system
would be best for Davidson; conse-

quently, an evidence question per-|-

General observations about con-
ditions in the job market tend to
hide widely varying situations.
Prospects are excellent in some oc-

would be encouraged to carry on in-

electorate of 925 students, only
576 votes, or sixty-two per cent
were cast in the election for stu-
dent body president. This meant
that 289 votes—well under a third
of the student body—could have
selected a man to fill the most im-
portant electoral position on this

campus.

To the members of the senior
class there is little more than a
personal interest and the exercise
of a right in voting in the elec-
tions coming up, since they will
not be here next year. But the
three lower classes have a definite
interest in who are elected as heads
of their classes, their student body,

their Y, and their publications. It
is not only the right, but the
duty, of every man in the student
body—especially every rising soph-
omore, junior and senior—to vote
for the candidates for these posi-
tions. The man who fails to vote
has no right to complain when the
election does not come out as he
would like it to. He has his chance
to do what he can to make it come
out differently; and it may happen
that his vote and the votes of a
few others like hint can change the
outcome of an election.

LETTER TO EDITOR...

(Continued From Page Two)
Council of the U. N. or the record
of U. S..Soviet relations.

Mr. Shriver’s conclusions, as far
as Davidson is concerned, are that
“by the very presence of a
ROTC on this campus, Davidson
College is committed to the active
preparation of this nation for war,”
which is not in harmony with the
objectives of the college.

My conclusions are these: David-
son College should offer to its
students the training necessary to
graduate men who will be educated
Christians, ready to undertake their
obligations as citizens of this na-
tion. In a world where armed con-
flict is still possible and as it could
be necessary for the United States
to use force to defend itself, the
ROTC fulfills a need' in American
education probably more necessary
now than at any time in the his-
tory of this country. —

Professor James F. Pinkney has
authorized me to state that he con-
curs in the ideas expressed in this
letter.
