Mother Theresa dies

Mother Theresa died Friday of cardiac arrest at the age of 87. This
brave woman dominated the ideal image of the church for many years.
Once a believer in fascism, Mother Theresa devoted her life to the
Roman Catholic church. Her mission and position was recently given
to a younger sister. She spent the majority of her life giving through
others and showing love to all human beings. Ironically, Mother
Theresa was to speak at Princess Diana’s funeral. Her legacy will live
oninthe hearts of all people, Catholic or not, because of her generosity
and kindness.

Britain mourns Princess Diana’s death

Britain is struggling to cope with the tragic death of Princess
Diana. The royal family has stated its utmost sadness and loss over
the death of the princess. Diana’s sons, Princes William and Harry,
are to stay with their father and their grandparents at Belmoral, the
royal vacation house.

Several photographers are being questioned for the crash. It has
been reported that the driver was drunk and driving at speeds of 120-
140 kilometers per hour.

Plane crashes in Cambodia

All but three passengers of a 66-passenger plane died Wednesday
in a plane crash in Cambodia. One toddler and two adults survived.
The cause of the crash on the Soviet-built Tupolev-134 is yet to be
determined, though it was raining quite heavily at the time.

People looted the scene and snatched money from the dead, stole
luggage, and took part of the plane before-police officers cleared the
area.

_ Cigarettes prices on the rise

Wholesale prices on cigarettes rose an average of 7.6 percent
Sept, 2,a move initiated by the nation’s leading cigarette makers. The
increase adds about seven cents a pack to the retail price.

The increase is the largest to date. Prices went up three cents per
pack in May 1995, four cents in April 1996, and five.cents in March
of this year. The price increases are expected to bring in about $1.6
billion over-the next 12 months, revenue desperately needed by the
tobacco industry to help pay for settlements with certain states. The
settlements are to reimburse the states for the medical costs in the
treatment of sick smokers, Florida and Mississippi, for example, are
to receive a combined total of $14.7 billion.

A proposed $368.5 billion national accord, subject to approval by
Congress, calls for the cigarette companies to settle state-filed law-
suits, restrict marketing, and pay fines if there is no decline in smoking
by young people. The proposal also protects cigarette companies from
lawsuits and punitive damages.

This recent price increase is supposedly one of many to come,
as the tobacco industry tries to counter increased government pres-

sure. Federal excise tax, currently 24 cents a pack, will rise to 39 cents
on Jan. 1, 2002.

Further problems for the Democratic Party

Al Gore, who has recently been investigated for improper cam-
paign financing, could be finding more Republican congresspeople at
his door. Gore apparently asked an Indonesian firm to ‘hire a
Baltimore firm, Ellicott Machine Corp., that specializes in drudging —
equipment. The Indonesian company then hired the firm.

A week later, the president of Ellicott Machine Corp. donated
$15,000 to the DNC. The Senate is investigating whether or not Gore
used his influence to bribe fund raising money.

The Attorney General is now deciding whether or not to seek an
independent council, which she is opposed to, though pressure is
being placed on her to do so. This council would investigate Gore’s
fundraising practices.
