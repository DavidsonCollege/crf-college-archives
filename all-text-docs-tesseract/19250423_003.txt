The Floridestator

In the mind of most. folks “the name
“Florida” conjures a vision of flowers,
oranges, and sunshine. Perfectly correct,
too. But they omit from their mental calis-
thenics the state’s most abundant and odd
species life—the real agent,
agentess, and embryo agent. Out in the wild
and wooley West men may be men and wom-
en governors. But down the and
swamps they are all real estators. It is to
the classification and description of the life
and surroundings of this queer type of ani-+
mal that we shall turn our most diligent at-
tention at this time,

We shall begin the infant the
race, the embryo agent as it were. As soon
as he is strong enough to clasp within his
feeble hand a perceptive mass he is presented
with a miniature replica of a modern domi-
cile. This he fondles, under competent
struction jin diew of the traditional rattle.
Every feature, every detail of its excellence
is firmly impressed upon his receptive mind.

Time rolls on and the child becomes larger,
more intelligent. and endowed with greater
vitality. His curiosity is gradually aroused,
He has this tiny toy, termed, in the queen's
English, house—in the vernacular,
property. But what shall he with it?
Experience has taught him the necessity of
some basic principle.
