Pi

appa Alpha Trophy
Won by Local Chapter

Beta Chapter on Davidson Campus |

Win Scholarship Cup for
First Time

pie chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha, located
at Davidson, has had the signal honor of
winning the scholarship cup offered by its
Supreme Council for the year 1924-25. This
cup has been given each year to the chapter
in the fraternity making the highest average
for that year, and it has come for the first
time to Beta chapter, which made for that
year an average ot 87.15 per cent.

The scholarship cup was established by the
convention of 1915, in an attempt to stimulate
beneficial competition and to encourage great-
er scholarship efforts and to reward unusual
excellence. The rules concerning the award
of this cup take into consideration the lack
of uniform grading in the different schools
and guard against inequalities of. standards.
This cup remains in Beta’s possession for the
remainder of this year, and if it is won three
times in succession, the chapter will become
the permanent owner.

This. cup is now in the Pi Kappa Alpha
hal, having been turned over to the Beta
chapter by the Beta Mu chapter at the Uni-
versity of Texas, winner last year. It has
the averages of the different chapters that
have won it engraved on it. Beta has further
distinguished itself this year by having two
of its members elected to Phi Beta Kappa,
honorary scholastic fraternity.

‘College Treasurer
Speaks at Vespers

Mr. F. L. Jackson, treasurer of Davidson
College, who spoke at the Y. M. C. A. ves-
per service Sunday evening, chose as his
subject, “College Problems and How Tradi-
tions Will Help to Solve Them.” As the
subject indicates, he dealt with student prob-
{lems and drew his main points from his own
experience and his knowledge of college men.
The talk was divided into four problems, the
problem of religious influence, the problem
of self-discipline or measuring up to respon-
| sibilities, the problem of representing the
college before the public, and the problem
of having a purpose.
Davidson tradition was shown to be a help
in solving the problem.

In each case a special

to college, where he assumes the p@sition of

at Davidson which is wholesome and spirit
ual. Tradition says that few men go away
without making up their minds to follow
Christ. Probably more men have decided to
enter the ministry on this campns than on any
{other spot, and laymen, who compose a great
majority of the students, decide to serve the
Master in their various spheres. The tone
jof the campus helps a man to fight out for
himself his own religious problems, and to
reach a happy solution.
