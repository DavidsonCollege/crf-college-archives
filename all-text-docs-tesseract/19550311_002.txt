Davidson’s ‘Primative’
Library To Burst At
Seams Soon

The recent acquisition by the College
Library of a Micro-film Reader makes
available a service for which a need has
been recognized for some time. At present
the library is regularly receiving micro-
filmed copies of both the New York Times
and The Charlotte Observer. In addition
the library can borrow micro-filmed
copies of newspapers and rare documents
from other libraries for the use of stu-
dents and faculty.

The main advantage in purchasing the
new machine, however, is to eliminate the
present policy of storing bound volumes
of past copies of the New York Times.
These volumes are large, filthy, and dif-
ficult to handle. In addition these files
occupy over 100 cubic yards of storage
space, space which could very profitably
be used for reading tables. The library
had no choice but to purchase the present
machine. The only other alternative was
for the library to become a depository
for copies of the New York Times.

The machine is not conveniently lo-
cated especially with regard to the loca-
tion of the New York Times Index and
the bound periodicals. It is to be hoped
that some more convenient location may
be worked out that will be consonant with
the safety of the machine. If the bound
volumes of the Times could be eliminated
by a film edition, space for a micro-film
room would be available in the basement.

The present volumes of the New York
Times should be replaced as speedily as
possible with micro-filmed copies with an
eye to donating our volumes to some less
fortunate library. The expense of this
(excluding the possibility of “manna”
from heaven) would necessarily mean pur-
chase over a period of 10 to:25 years.

Davidson College has every right to
be proud of having improved its facilities
to this extent. However, the fact remains
that the libraries of UNC and Duke have
had micro-film equipment almost as long
as the mind of man runneth not to the
contrary, and that most college and uni-
versity libraries have had this equipment
for several years. This is another graphi-
cal illustration that the Davidson Library
is several years behind those of institu-
tions of like size and ability.

With an enlarged budget and in-
creased interest on the part of the admin-
istration, great strides have been made
in the last year or two. In accordance with
recommendations made by the manage-
ment engineers in their 1953 survey a
Reference Librarian has been secured,
stacks have been installed on the second
mezzanine, and book acquisitions have
been increased. The Director of the Li-
brary plans to request a considerable in-
crease in the book appropriation for next
year. His request should certainly be
adopted for according to his statement the
minimum goal is 80,000 volumes.

The one further problem is that of
space. The management engineers recom-
mended converting the seminar rooms
and the central basement into reading
rooms. There are valid reasons for maip-
taining these facilities, rather obvious in
regard to the seminar rooms, but no less
valid in regard to the central basement.
The present work-room facilities would of
necessity have to be moved into the north
basement, at present uninhabitable. Con-
tractors estimate that conversion of the
north basement alone would be a very ex-
pensive undertaking. Should these recom-
mendations be carried out (which should
certainly be the case if no other provision

is to be made) the engineers state that
seating capacity would be “almost” ade-
quate.

However, a much more serious prob-
lem is in the offing. The absolute capacity
of the present stacks (there is no room

- for any more) is 90,000 volumes. At the

present rate of book acquisition this total
will be attained within 12 years. At that
time unless some other provision is made,
the library will have the same inadequate
seating arrangement it has today and not
another book will be able to be crowded
into its stacks. °

The time to act is now before this im-
passe is reached. The Board of Trustees
and the Administration should begin
plans now for the construction of a siza-
ble addition (estimated cost, $150,000 to
$250,000) to the present structure, which
would solve the present and future prob-
lems.—T.W.W.

Leonardo Among The
Lilliputians

“We are like dwarfs seated on the
shoulders of giants; we see more things
than the ancients and things more distant,
but this is due neither to the sharpness
of our own sight, nor to the greatness of
our own stature, but because we are
raised and borne aloft on that giant mass.”

Anne Fremantle uses these words by
Bernard of Chartres in the introduction
to her The Age of Belief, and they are
significant words for our “progressive
and scientific” age. Seeing and hearing
little but the miracles of modern-day
science, we are too prone to forget that
these miracles are not solely the product
of our more advanced age: we should not
be nearly so far along in the march of
knowledge if it had not been for our less
“scientific” predecessors.

Davidson students will be able to ap-
preciate to some extent the achievements
of earlier centuries in the current ex-
hibition of the work of Leonardo da Vinci.
The International Business Machines Cor-
poration’s display of his drawings and
models .represents only a small portion
of his entire work, but the examples which
have been chosen suffice to show the
genius and dexterity in many fields of
knowledge which was characteristic of
that intellectual ideal, the Renaissance
man.

Leonardo would have felt cramped in
the modern educational system with its
emphasis on specialization. He refused to

-confine his efforts to one field, such as

art, but branched out into many other
areas of knowledge, at first to assist him
in his artistic work but later as a task
of love. He was not satisfied to rest on his
laurels, but he insisted on still further
conquests—a good example for us when
we begin to feel as if our education were
finished already.

We think of ours as an air age—
Leonardo invented an airplane, a helicop-
ter, and a parachute four hundred years
before they came into use. Ours is a
mechanized age—Leonardo drew up plans
for a power-driven car and a forerunner
of the turbine and recognized the princi-
ples of the clutch and differential used
in our automobiles. Perhaps our age can
be characterized by dts warfare —
Leonardo invented numerous machine-
guns, a breech-loading cannon, intricate
fortresses, aerial bombs, and long before
Churchill he recognized the merits of
the tank.

Add to this impressive array of me-
chanical ability his “The Last Supper,”
the “Mona Lisa,” his anatomical studies,
his research in geology, and his contribu-
tions to cartography: the sum is genius.
We cultural dwarfs have an opportunity
to catch a glimpse of the stature of one of
the giants of our heritage, on whose
shoulders we stand to lift our vision above
the trivial and the commonplace. The
opportunity should not be lightly dis-
missed.—M.A.C.

John Dewey Says

On education: ‘The profft of educa-
tion is the ability it gives the learners to
discriminate—to penetrate below the sur-
face.”

On principtes: “A man who prides him-
self upon acting upon principles is likely
to be a man who insists upon having his
own way without learning from experi-
ence what is the better way.”

On modern morality: “Conventional
morality is a drab morality, in which the
only fata] thing is to be conspicuous.”

On ftove: “Men will never love their
enemies until they cease to have
enmities.”

A Definite Fundamentalist Tinge:

Y Must Not Thumb Noses At
Georgia Prayer Meeting Group

Reform has reared its unfamiliar
head out of a third floor window
in Georgia dormitory, and a new
organism is seeking adjustment
in the patterned environment of
Davidson religious life. The suc-
cess of the Georgia prayer meet-
ings has equally surprised both
their organizers and the YMCA,
and neither group was prepared
for the responso—or quite sure

what it involved. After three weeks
the issues are still far from clear,
but several elements are emerging.

The most obvious thing is that
Georgia has touched a real need
for a considerable segment of the

student body.

Originally, it

was intended

7. that one meet-

iM® ing be held to

i try to rejuven-

’ ate the YMCA

hall prayer

meetings. But

q the initial re-

t sponse encour-

MeMa aged subsequent

ns meetings which

have increased in numbers each
week.

Someone commenting on the
situation drew an analogy to the
Reformation, comparing the Geor-
gia Movement to a Protestant af-
firmation of sincere, down-to-
earth, “gospel” religion against
the sterile encrustations that
characterize the YMCA program
which in a Catholic sense domi-
nates formal religion on the cam-
pus. Analogies in any case are
slippery, and this is a good one on
neither historical nor theological
grounds, But it is nonetheless sug-
gestive in several ways.

First of all, it conveys the idea
.of positive reform of the existing
religious structures, which is the
spirit in which Georgia began. And
it also suggests the possibilities
which may result now that the
movement has grown to its present
proportions.

THREE ALTERNATIVES

There seem to be three alterna-
-tives. (1) The whole movement
might simply be left to run down
and die out in the course of time.
If it is simply a revival experi-
ence, an “emotional jag about
Jesus Christ” as Dr. Beach put it
during UCM, then left alone this
would no doubt happen. But if it
is a real reform in the sense of
touching a genuine, continuing re-
ligious need, then it is made of
sturdier stuff and will survive.

By JASON MeMANUS

(2) This indicates the second
possibility: a continuing group on
the campus representing a less
liberal point of view than the
YMCA and operating outside of the
YMCA program. This possibility is
the real crux of the whole issue,
and at the moment describes
exactly what is the case.

(3) Perhaps the ideal possibility,
certainly from the YMCA’s point
of view, would be a kind of trans-
fusion of the vitality and spirituali-
ty of the Georgia movement back
into the YMCA program. Return-
ing to our analogy, one of the
greut sources of the medieval
Church’s strength was its ability
to channel periodic spiritual re-
forms and revivals back into the
life of the Church. Luther’s reform
was one significant failure, on the

other hand! This is why analogies.

are slippery.
THE HUMAN REACTION

But what does this kind of
analysis indicate? It points up
sharply a failure in the YMCA
program. Somehow hall prayer
meetings have degenerated to mu-
tual spiritual admiration societies,
or reluctant accumulations of nice
guys who can’t say no to their hall
prayer leaders. Revitalization was
needed, and quite frankly the
YMCA feels a little miffed that
the regeneration came from with-
out, rather than within. It is a
human reaction. The leaders of the
Georgia Movement are also a
little proud of the success of their
vehicle. This too is a human re-
action.

FUNDAMENTALIST COLOR

Together these human elements
have made for a slight tension in
the meetings between the leaders
of the two groups. Ego breaks in
upon even our divine discussions.
But there is another and deeper
reason for the tension. It is caused
by the cleavage in viewpoint be-
tween the two sides. The Georgia
Movement does have a funda-
mentalist color, as I think its
leaders would admit. Perhaps this
is the source of its appeal. In a
college environment, ultimates and
authority are discarded in so many
realms of study and thought that
it is hard to assert it in religion.
So the prevailing culture-thought
atmosphere tends away from fun-
damentalism. But many men find
the fundamentalist viewpoint most
satisfying for their religious needs.
And these men at Davidson find
this point of view does not per-
meate the YMCA. Why?

demned by the writers of this coun-
try’s Constitution and is generally
agreed to be unethical by legisla-
tors of the present.

This redefinition is somewhat
stricter than the former rules
which applied to the military de-
partment. It is obvious that such
reaction is contrary to the spirit
of the newly liberalized system in-
augurated by the administration.

It seems, therefore that our mill-
tary detachment considers itself
an educational institution, separate
and distinct from the rest of the
college. Their attitude appears to
be that the college is here by the
grace and benevolence of the
United States Army. Such an out-
look suggests that the ROTC tail
wags the Davidson dog.

Since Davidson did not wish this
curse upon itself, it seems that
the administration might well as-
sert itself to remove said biight
from the campus. If the depart-
ment down the hill hopes to retain
the favor of the college proper,
it might be suggested—to use an
analogy from the military—that
the Davidson ROT Corps get in
step.

It is because the YMCA is a
broad, nonsectarian religious asso-
ciation which tries to provide a
framework in which various points
of view—fundamental and liberal—
can together express and channel
the energy of the various faiths. It
ought to be a community of
seekers,

MENTAL BLOCKS AND
INTELLECTUALS

Somewhere the Davidson YMCA
has failed to make that plain and
true, and excluded a large group
of men whom the Georgia Move-
ment has reached. The more
liberal hierarchy of the YMCA and
the student body has an equal re-
sponsibility in the realm of Chris.
tian humility—not to throw up
mental blocks when they hear the
word “testimony” and peer down
thier long intellectual noses. The
basis of the Protestant heritage
which we all share is that every
man can respond to the truth in
his own way. The basis of the
Protestant heresy is mistaking our
way for the truth.

Dangerously Hit

Dear Editor: .

It has been noticed ‘by aware
Davidson students that the faculty
has abolished the first report of
the Spring Semester. This is a
move with grave consequences.

I wonder whether the faculty
seriously considered the void they
were creating in student conversa-
tion. Now such games as “What
Did Prof. So-and-So Give You?”
or “What Is Your Average?” will
not be able to be played by Da-
vidsonians. This happy medium of
student intercourse has been
dangerously tampered with. There
is some hope, however, that the
seasonal game of “How’s Your
Hell Week Coming?” will partly
remedy this void in Davidson con-
versation left by the elimination of
this report.

The fact that the faculty would
take such a daring step suggests
that they might be trying to de-
emphasize the prominence of
grades in favor of an emphasis on
education for its own sake and the
development of a common frame
of reference so that we will be
able to talk intelligently.

Sincerely,
TOM FIROR.

Editor,

The Davidsonien,

Davidson, N. C.

Dear Sir:

May I express to you my appre-
ciation for such a wonderful time
at Davidson yesterday. One always
has a good time when returning to
the old hill even tho you have
to drive 100 miles out of the way
to come. It is always worth while.

The football game between the
varsity and the old-timers was in
my opinion one of the best efforts
the college has ever had to pro-
mote better relations between the
college and the alumni. I heard
several aolumni voice the same
opinion. I hope it becomes an an-
nual affair.

Davidson alumni are in my
opinion the most loyal group of
alumni anywhere, and they ore all
proud of the fine record the Wild-
cats made last year on the grid-
iron. There seems to be a renewed
interest everywhere among David.
son men in the grand old college.
Lets keep that spirit alive!

With best wishes

RACKS

IN THE

LOISTER

By GILBERT GRAGG

What Does The Christian
Teacher Owe His Students?

Now that Davidson’s tuition is
justly going up to maintain its high
quality of education, it seems ap-
propriate to turn a closer gaze on
the recipients of a targe part of
our money. Are we actually getting
our money’s worth from our profes-
sors? What do we have the right
to expect of them es Christien
teachers?

CLASS LECTURES

We certainly ere entitled to
stimulating and interesting lec-
tures, The appalling fact, however,
is that many of our professors
make little preparation for their
lectures, depending on notes weary
of use fromepast years. Reading o
lecture is inexcusable; after all,
how do professors expect their
students to remember what they
are spending a lifetime studying
and still do not know? With the
many new books and periodicals
shedding illumination on even the
most static subjects, class lectures
should be vital and timely; the
fascinating archaeological
coveries going on constantly should
be used to great advantage in His-
tory and Bible lectures, and
journals in English, Science,
Sociology, Education, and Eco-
nomics should be relied upon
heavily by our teachers to im-
prove their lectures.

PERSONAL CONFERENCES

We have a right to expect paral.
lel assignments in pertinent pub-
lications, since one could get e
liberal education this way.
Surely it is a waste of money for
the library to subscribe to many
specialized journals when they are
hardly read, At least once a month
our teachers should arrange con-
ferences with their students to dis-
cuss these assignments and mu-
tually stimulate each other. Every
professor should feel an obligation
to know his students personally
and seek to relate with him a par-
ticular course with the total pic-
ture of his interests, vocational
plans, and major field. Our teach-
ers should remember that they,
too, are just students who have
gone @ little further into the sad
joyous world of learning end
should be anxious to gain new in-
sights from class discussions and
personal conferences. e

CLASSROOM PROCEDURE

We have the right to expect a
classroom atmosphere favorable to
8 mutual exchange of ideas and an
opportunity for constructive ques-
tiens. Rother than rehash material
presented more clearly in the text-
books (which should be. changed
often for professors’ intellectual
growth), anyway, our professors
should be our guides to thinking
and compliment us with original
and thought-provoking tests.

A fifty-minute class is much too
precious and expensive to be
squandered by ego-flettering auto-
blographical excursions end Irrele-
vant jokes. We do want the benefit
of the wit ond wisdom our profes.
sors have acquired on their jour.

MISSIONARIES TO

OAVIDSON

We expect our professors to have
enough time to live up to the un-
selfish requirements of their pro-
fession. It is indeed a shame that -
our school can allow some of its
professors to become bogged down
in a great many committees, im-
portant though they may be, that
they have no time to give their
best to their students. Why not
with increased tuition hire two or
three Phd’s in committee work so
our teachers can return to their
work?

The job of a Christian teacher at
Davidson involves being a mis-
sionary to an unbelievably anti.
educational and nominal Christian
student body. It would indeed be
difficult for any teacher to fully
live up to these standards but a
great many at Davidson have done
more than others—these few have
made Davidson what it is! A dedi-
cated teacher’s reward is immense
—the satisfaction of knowing that
he has the admiration and devo-
tion (if not popularity) of his stu-
dents and is seeking to the best
of his ebility to serve His Lord
who grew in “wisdom end stature”
by following diligently and con
selentiously his high calling.

ROTC Is Turned Down

You don’t say no to Uncle Sam,
so the military department was
rather nonplussed when a pros-
pective freshman declined its of-
fer of compulsory military train-
ing at Louisiana State University.

In reply to an information form
explaining that two years of basic
military training are required at
LSU of all physically fit male stu-
dents be}ween 14 and 23, one fresh-
man wrote: |

“Thank you for your generous
offer to tet me join the ROTC at
LSU. I assure you that I would

arta

deem it the greatest honor ever
to come to me. After giving the
matter deep consideration, I have
decided that it would be best if
I declined your offer.”

The freshman refused the offer
“because of the advantage that it
would give me over the girls on
the campus.” .
