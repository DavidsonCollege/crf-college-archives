Revitalized Slack sheds old image

By BAD BERNARD
and HOGMAN
In softball, as in all sports,
there is rarely a tournament
game played that does not
contain its one moment of
truth. It’s the time that, when
the going gets tough, the tough

get going. It’s the time when
the men are separated from the
boys or (if you'll pardon us,
Betty) the strong are set apart
from the weak. It’s a time when
most people choke while a few
weather the storm.

moment of truth had come for
Bertis E. Downs IV and his
raucous bunch of Whizz Kids.
Bert and Co. were down 2 to 1
to the Dodgers of MacF leet and
Stuff in the late innings of their
semi-final tournament game.
With two out and prospects for
victory dim, Bert strolled to the
plate. A lifetime .232 hitter,
Bert’s life to this point had been
one marked by mediocrity. He
was born the middle child in the
family, was an average student
in high school, and only dated
average looking girls.

With the momentum of the
game swinging rapidly in Mac-
Fleet’s favor, Bert had the
weight of his team on his
shoulders. Shaking his average
image, Bert lashed a scorching
line drive to center field and
circled the bases in what proved
to be the clutch hit of the game.
(The Kids eventualy won 3-2.)
We asked Bert what had gone
on in his mind before the hit:
“Well fellas, I thought about a
lot of things while I was at the
plate -- my hair, Dr. Lester, the
Foghat concert Thursday night,
starving children in India, my
paper route. Then, I just hit it

and ran. Hey, I’ll be the first to

a —

admit I was lucky, but aren’t
we all at some time or another?”

Bert’s image is now per-
manently altered. He’s let his
hair down, gotten engaged,
gotten into law school -- he
became a non-average winner.
In the meantime, MacF leet and
Stuff advanced to the loser’s
bracket.

The other ‘surprise of the
tournament is the late resur-
gence of Slack to the Slack
Power. Slack, our early season
favorite, suffered through a
dismal 3-6 season and saw its
players begin to change for the
worse. Stewart Boswell began
to like disco music, QB went
straight, Dave Anspach consi-
dered turning Communist, and
Chuck Barrineau burned his
Grateful Dead albums. A 6-5
victory over Dartus Tunic,
however, turned the tide and
Slack to Slack moved on to take
their place in the finals. of the
winner’s bracket, where they
will meet the Whizz Kids. (They
clinched that spot with a 2-1
victory over the Four Skins
Wednesday night.)

In other key tournament
games, Presto’s Grill eliminated
the War Kiwis 12-9 as Bobby

McCarthy threw for two touch-
downs and rushed for 189
yards. Big T and the Oxytoc-
sins squashed the Lizard Kic-
kers 9-3 with Scott Harbottle
celebrating the third day of the
anniversary of his first IMAC
hit. Despite my play, Dartus
Tunic beat Bone 148 and our
BB&H freshman team of the
year, What It is, 14-1.

‘In girls play, Hiyaki proved
themselves as adept in softball
as in letter-writing and took the
best two out of three finals from
the Little Killers. This team has
so dominated girls’ sports and
inspired us to the point that we.
might make a contribution to
NOW.

With the close of this IMAC

-season, Bernie realizes that he

must find a replacement for his
cohort H-Man. In order to meet
the qualifications of an IMAC
writer, one must be funny,
intelligent, articulate, and a fan
of the University of Arkansas.
If you want to apply send in a
