Deferment Tests

Set In December

Selective Service College Qualifi-
cation examinees will compete in
the third series of tests to be given
December 4, 1952, and April 23,
1953, at the thousand testing cen-
ters throughout the country.

General Hershey, head of he
tests, emphasized that increasing
manpower demands made it nec-
essary and important that each

> draft-eligible student who has not
taken the test do so as soon as
possible,

To be eligible to: apply for the
college deferment test, a student
must (1) intend to request defer-
ment as a student; (2) be satisfac-
torily pursuing a full-time course of
instruction; and (3) must not pre-
viously have taken the test.

Application cards for the
taking of the test will not be
available after October 6, so it
is entirely necessary that all
students wishing to take the test
apply before that time.

The present criteria for deferment
as an undergraduate student are
cither a satisfactory score (70) on
thre Selective Service College Quali-
fication Test or specified rank in
class (upper half of the male
freshman class, upper two thirds of
the male sophomore class, dt upper
three fourths of the male junior
class).

The two forthcoming administra-
tions of the College Qualification
Test represent the cighth and ninth
testing datés of the program. In the
first series of tests 64 per cent of the

richest gains from Davidson.

“I shall always cherish his man-

Parking Capacity Of Fraternity Court
Doubled: Other Improvements Made

aad

NEW ‘PARKING AREA AT

Be
FRATERNITY COURT

De.

—

Several improvements have been
made in the fraternity court park-
ing area. Much of the center of
the court was paved with asphalt.

The situation is now such that
the court can hold twice as many
cars as before, which will be a defi-
nite asset on a dance weekend.
There is enough room for parallel
parking in the paved area, not to
mention end-to-end parking all the
way around the court next to the
fraternities.

Bumper logs were placed in order
to prevent cars from going into the
center of the court. These logs
were imported from South Caro-
lina. They are especially treated
with rot-proof materials and are
very similar to the telephone and
telegraph poles seen all over ‘the

nation.

The part of the court which is
not used for parking has been
thoroughly graded to better the
drainage problem in the court. The
whole central area that is not paved
has been covered with a thick layer
of pine needles which will keep the
ground in that area from getting
muddy.

Additional drainage pipes, ec.
have been set up in order to keep
water off the grounds of the lower
houses. The fraternity court is now

Ken Boyer Takes

Post With Library

Succeeding Miss Judith Passmore,
for years a library landmark as cir-
culation librarian, is Davidson pre-
ministerial Ken
over. the job when Miss Passmore
resigned last sprinty.

Boyer, a philosophy major, who
intends to follow h.s father’s foot-
steps as a missionary, is registered
in Columbia Theological Seminary.

Ken began his library work as a
sophomore in 1949, working in the
magazine files and government
room. He continued this work until
his promotion to the front desk this
year, He says, “So far, the desk job
has been very interesting, and Lam
looking forward to the rest of the
year... Every day something

. new

Ken remarked that he was work-
ing on some improvements on: the
keeping of library records. These

are mostly behind the scenes, where’

students do not see, but are cal-
culated to make the library run
smoother.

Ken and three of his four sisters
were born in Chinju, Korea, where
his missionary parents served until
their evacuation just before Pear!
Harbor. Ken has lived since then
in’ Michigan, Florida, Virginia,
Tennessee, North Carolina, and On-
tario. He entered Davidson in 1948,
and was a member of the Campus
Club ontil the spring of 1950, of
the concert and football bands, and
of the Photo Club. He also ‘worked
on Scripts ‘n Pranks.

Ken had one remark to make
about the students who use the
library. “It is amazing,” he says,
“how many people come hére four
years without ever learning how to
find books, while others progress
in their ability to use the library
year by year.”

College Undergoes
Three-fold Survey
By New York Firm

For the next several months Da-
vidson College will be undergoing
a physical, financial, and adminis-
trative survey by Cresap, McCor-
mick and Paget, management en-
wineers of New York City. At
present there are three represen-
tatives of this company on the
Davidson campus, Messrs. Eldon
Shoup, Archer Rrown and Grady
Jensen. A fourth man, Dr, Paul

‘Gillen, will arrive later this month

to assist, with the survey.

This survey, which wilt involve
several weeks of actual observation
and later study in New York City,
will be a study of the administra-
tion and administrative organiza-

United Film Society
To Sponsor Pictures

Of World Wide Fame

“Great Expectations” will be pre-
sented, Tuesday, October 7, in
Chambers | Auditorium by — the
United Literary Film Society, Tom
Abel announced today.

The ULFS is a group jointly
sponsored by the Philanthropic and
Eumanean Literary Societies and
certain members of the faculty, stu-
dent body and staff, and was found-
ed for the purpose of bringing out-
standing films, either American or
foreign, to the Davidson compus far
both the enlightenment and enter-
tainment of the audiences.

The admission to the series of
five movies is one dollar, and tickets
may be had Monday in the dormi-
tories, in the lobby of Chambers
after chapel Monday, or before the
show Tuesday evening.

This is the schedule for the Fail
semester, 1952: Tuesday, October
7, “Great Expectations,” 7:15 p.m.;
Wednesday, November 5, “Alex
ander Nevsky” ‘or “Zero De Coa-
duite,” 8:30 p.w.; Tuesday, Novem
ber 12 (to be announced) 7:15;
Wednesday, December 10, “Never
Give a Sucker an Even Break,” 8:30
p.m.; Wednesday, January 7, “The
Blue Angel,” 8:30 p.m. .

“Great Expectations” alone is
worth the price of admission, “Alex-
ander Nevsky” is famous, for its
score by Pokofiev, and “Zero De
Conduite” is a movie dealing with
life in a boy’s school.

“Never Give a Sucker an Even
Break” is partly written and is
acted in by the late W. C. Fields,
and, needless to say, “The Blue
Angel” features Marlene Dietrich

long before she was a grandmother.

CHARITY DRIVES
SHOULD BE UNITED,

SAYS THE EDITOR

NUMBER 2

Professor H. A. Baumann presents Student Body President
Jack Ruth with new edition of the Bible in commemorative serv-

ice held in chapel Tuesday.

Special Ceremony Features

New Revised

The official publication of the
American Revised Standard Version
of the Bible was made on Septem-
ber 30, 1952, It was commemorated
ina special chapel service on Tues-
day.

The new revision of the Bible.
with its great accuracy and modern
form, has been’ made possible only
through the patient work of many
American scholars for over twenty
years, and through the great ad-
vances made during the past three
centuries in the discovery and wun-
derstanding of the original Greek
and Hebrew texts.

Even the revisions of the late
nineteenth century have been out-
dated by the new Version, which

has Corrected their occasional
archaic expressions and = inaccu-
racies.

The translation of the Scriptures
from their original Hebrew and
Greek-into other languages and dia-
lects is a process that has continued
for many centuries. The Septuagint
version of the Old Testament writ-
ings,
400 A, D., and the King James
Version of 161] are perhaps the best
known translations. The King
James Version is still the most be-
loved and most used version of our
day,

The Revised Standard Version is
not a new translation, but is a re-

vision of the 1901 American Stan-]_

dard Version, which in its turn was
a revision of the King James Ver-
sion.

‘Two services have been held at
Davidson to commemorate the pub-
lication of the Revised Standard
Version of the Bible. On Sunday,
September 28, 1952, Dr. Bernard

the Latin. Vulgate Bible of

Bible Edition

Boyd of the University of North
Carolina devoted his Vesper ser-
mon to the subject of the impor-
tance of the Pible and of this new
version.

Professor Henry Patmann held
the chapel service in commemora-
tion of the new version’s publica-
jon, and made five awards of copies -
to leaders in the Davidson family.
‘Those receiving copies were Jack

Ruth, President of the Student
Body, Hubert Cannon, YMCA
president; Dr. W.. C. Workman,

Dr. Walter Lingle, and Dave Moy-
lan.

Naturally, we all asked Johannes why. ‘Well, [ am here,

Tt seems that when the tall

Dutchman teft here last June he
made up his mind that he would
come back to Davidson, although

took off hitchhiking “West... just

Mr. Miedmer, with a 60-Ib. pack
on his back went via thumb to
Texas; then to Oklahoma City,
where he got a job with a combine
crew, The work was miserable
(work from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.), but
so was the pay.
