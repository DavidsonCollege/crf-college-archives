Ike Says “Yes”

The affirmative heard around the
world came as no real surprise. but it has
seemingl’ ‘had the desired effect.
Through political’‘lenses. the months of
preceding preparation reveal an extreme-
ly well wrough: publicity program, one
characterized  »s¥chological intitition.
diplomatic man and strategically
timed revelations. .

The public was letl to believe over the
waiting period that Ike would doubtlessly
be elected if he would’ run, and that his
running was paramount to the peace of
the world. The ticker tape on Wall Street
rose and fell with every presidential pal-
pitation, and the prestige ot heart special-
ists reached new. heights on popular opin-
ion poils. Newspape>> were made in cir-
culation if-they carried a lead picture of
the recuperating and :pondering president
with shoigun in hand or golf hat in place.
The weekly insert magazines became com-
piling. journals of Hagerty flashes. as ad:
ministrative aclion and ponderous prob-
lems were suhordinated to the all power-
ful decision, This witole:program does not
desecrate the position of the man in ques-
tion nor overly emphasize the import:
ance of the decision in world and national
affairs: it merely forms an. interesting
example of the political svstemi and
scheme ot tilting. under which we operate
in our present democratic society.

President Eirenhower has justly
become a symbol, both to the world
as well as to our nation, of peace,
power, and relative prosperity in
times of delicate decisions and stag-
gering implications. As a catylist in
national politics he has been able to
weld together diverse elements. ex-
tremes, and unfortunate instigators
from both parties. Attempting te
transcend party affiliation on many
instances he has been able to resolve
problems otherwise unanswerable in
the light of political maneuvers. He
has handled his position in a military
manner, properly delegating auv-
thority while retaining overall com-
mand responsibility and direction
His subordinates and advisors have
carried many of the great burdens
and have been able to adequately run
the government in his absence.

In the world arena he has interna-
tional respect and prestige: and his voice
has carried the weight of a very large
percentage of the American people. Here.
too, he has become a symbol of peace and
hope. To many international observers
the fate of U. S. policy abroad rests at
present with Eisenhower—to change
leaders .would drastically imperil our
world ship of state.

That such power and importance
should rest on one human individual
has its obvious drawbacks and falla-
cies regardless of the individual, but
such is our present situation. The na-
tion sought Ike, the world looks to
ike, and now the times demand Ike.

Barnstorming in its truest sense will
not likely be needed in light of the very
effectual preparatory campaign just com-
pleted. With Ike’s decision came Republi-
can sighs of relief and shrieks of poli-
tical panic from their adversaries. The
question of a running mate—whether the
“good will ambassador” or another— re-
mains to be solved. Recent criticisms of
the administration will have to be an-,
swered and several programs strongly de-
fended before the curtains at the polls are
drawn. At the present, however, Republi-
can prestige appears relatively ascendent
in the public eye.

It can certainly be said that we
are living in an interesting and mo-
mentous time. The student who does
not keep his eyes open and his ears
attune is much the loser— for it is
indeed a great time to be walking
around.

Erosion But Not
Evasion

The Chapel Committee is to be heartily
commended for presenting “the other
side’ in Thursday's chapel. service. Re-
gardicss of whether you feel that our
culture is in danger of erosion or whether
you have conscientious compunctions to
integrate, it is only healthy and mature to
observe the whole question and the major
solutions. Suppression of opposing yiew-

points is not only detrimental to your.

eatise but also to the mutual. understand-
ing and eventual resolution of the prob-
lem in question. The “Southern side” of
the segregation issue has been conspieu-
ous by its absence from our platform and
public gatherings as have séveral other
important issues. It is hoped that the
realistic approach displayed by the Com-
mittee will underlie its future studies and
programs.

It can certainly be said that the
speaker gave a very frank: stimulating,
and sincere presentation. Speaking from
‘honest conviction he did not evade the
issue as he saw it nor escape into undue
emotion. It is acmark of the Christian
gentleman to speak. forthrightly from in-
ner convictions—also to listen receptively
to other's thoughts—also to reach a con-
clusion im the light of knowledge. effort.
and praveriul consideration.

The Davidsonian opens its numerous
tourist files to all those contemplating
trips abroad this summer or in the near
future. Every week literature comes into
this office on travel opportunities and
tours. These have been placed in appro-
pirate files and all interested are encour-
aged to utilize them to their greatest
advantage during office hours... Also into
the mail box each week come many
folders on international. scholarships,
‘especially from the Lisle ' Fellowships.
Neatly every foreign country is repre-
‘sented in these offers. as manv oppor-
tunities are now being made available for
student study and life in foreign coun-
tries. These. too. are open for student
inspection | ROTC films to be shown
in the Union in succeeding weeks are both
interesting and informative. Combat ex-
periences .and prominent statesmen are
featured. An excellent and free oppor-
tunity to become “aware”’—don't miss
them ... As college mowers begin the

first cutting of spring and as the odor of .

new mown grass invades ecclesiastical
cells of meditation. a slogan. found in one
seniors room, comes prominently in
vogue. It reads “Work fascinates me, |
can sit and look at it for hours.”.......
The Roval Commission for the Proper
Evaluation and Decision on the Court

Student Council Proposes Revamped Court of Control
REVISED FROSH RULES

The following revised Freshmen Regulations accompanied by ideas
expressed in the accompanying editorial will compose a petition which
the Student Council will present to the Chapel Committee. The purpose
of the petition is to obtain pormission to return the Court of Control

For the past few weeks a Stu:
dent Council committce has been
investigating the problem of what
to do about the controversial Court
of Control. Because a recent poll
revealed that the students over:
whelmirgly wanted to retaim the
court but not in the state in which
it operated this fall, the committee
has thoroughly revised the Fresh-

men Regulations and proposed that.

With certain iinprovements the

Court. be permitted to function

again next year. The proposals of

this committee are based upon

ideas gathered from the poll, a

meeting of class officers, and the
Student Council.

Dance System Needs No Change

Dear Editor:

In the last issue of the David.
sonien there appeared oa letter
which concérned the present.dance
weekend © situation. There were
several points In that” letter with
which I would like. to take issue.

First. the statement was made
that “the cast of the dances has
gone far above .the reasonable
level, and that (he) “doesn't feel
that it is .possible ‘to “get $8.00
worth of enjeyment from any
band.” [| hope that this eritic re-

alized that‘ta bring ANY. band of -

interest to the campus involves a
rather sizable outlay of cash

Certainly, there are many bands
throughout the country. which
would not. cost mich. But, 1 be-
lieve that. this critic must agrée
that the quatity of their music is
either untested or unsatsiffictory:
else hey would also be charging
“far above:the reasonable level ”

Incidenily. Vr. Critic. if the stu-
dent body had supported the Les
Brown concert. held in the gym be-
fore Thank-swing, the cost of the
past dance weekend wonld not
have heen. as great.
serve could have been built up,
thus cushioning the price of the
Herman band.

-AS for any band “considering it
a real opportunity to plav at Da-
vidson.” [ doubt seriously if 90
per. cent of the band leaders or
their sidemen cvon kndw that Da-
vidson i. on the map They might
play better tor sound:.better). if
the acoustics or the audience's re-
action inspired them to do so, But,
no band plass a better dance
(MERELY) because they are play-
ing at Davidson rather than some
other school. No band “really
wants to come to Davidson.” unless
the price is right. The price is the
thing: which makes the difference.

In my opinion, the IFC has done
a good job in lowering the asking
price of band agents this year. The
lowering. of the Herman Band
agent’s price.was no exception The
combined cost of the Homecoming
and Midwinters weekends was low-
ered in this manner by $2000.00
The IFC IS reflecting the majority
opinion of the student body. If
anything, the majority of the stu-
dent body desires the bands which
have “biz” names. provided that
the IFC can get these bands at a
desirable price.

T cannot understand what ad-
vantage. if any, a social committec
of the emire student body would
have over the TFC. The IFC plans
our danecs to the best of its abili-
ty. The IFC is selected through our
present fraternity and independent
system. What better means would
this critic have?

In the opinion of many on the

took' no more liberty between the

band of comparable renown would
have. déne. I dare say that if this

some of the longer unbroken dance
periods, he had unusual unbounded

Perhaps I have let my personal
regard ‘for the Herman group and
the IFC’s work this year  over-
shaadow.my opinion. in this matter.
But, being in the midst of a much
larger segment of opinion on the
campus, lL. cannot help but be out-
spoken on this matter I would like
to remind our critic that it is im-
possible to please all of the people

all of the time.

Davidson Student Must Shake
Off Apathy and Unawareness

Davidson College has been and
Wil continue to be noted for many
‘unique and outstanding qualities in
its educational program. It is also
known, however, for some . very
grave faults. Not the least of these
is the prevalent attitude of un-
awareness and unconcern that
stifles much of the possible
thought and action on the campus.

Most of us often do aot realize
this fact of our existenee here un-
til it is sharply
pointed up in
particular
stances as it-has
. been to me re.
\ eently. It is
necessary for us
/ all to be con-

tinually faced
; with this prob-
lem and realize
Miller the moral obli-

gation that rests
upon us to changé such a situa-
tion.

One of the international stu-
dents at Davidson is very definitely
concerned about what most of us
consider to be the real and basic
issues that are around us (and I
am sure that the other interna-
tional students share this concern).
But he is disappointed that the in-
terest of Davidson students lies
generally within the realm of
things that immediately concern
them, and many of these are fairly
superficial.

We all spend a large part of
our time and conversation in
discussion of girls, sports, fra-
ternity life, etc. This is all well
and good, but it is not enough.
There is too much else going
on that vitally concerns us;
and yet we either ignore these
other questions and values, or
‘are ignorant of them.

Even though we live within the
sheltered environs of Davidson,
that fact does not keep us from

in-,

being a part ‘of thé rest of the
world. And we must face the fact
that our time here is limited. This
time should be spent in stsenuous
preparation for what we shall meet
when we finish. Our perspective at
present is largely self or Davidson
centered and could never be said
to be world centered.

Where outside of the classroom
and a few organizations is there
any real awareness of what is go-
ing on in the rest. of the world
such as the un‘versal racial ten-
sions, national and_ international
revolutions, American foreign poli-
ey, and the spread of. the Com-
munist faith?

Of course these are all general
and broad topics, but they are ex-
tremely relevant and of great im-
portance to one who is intimately
concerned. A_ Brazilian student
visiting campuses in our country
was extremely disappointed in
hat he: saw.

Christian students in America
were completely unconcerned
about what was happening to his
country and his people. He saw
no hope here and felt that the
only help would come from Com.
munism.

In the opinion of the Davidson
international student mentioned
earlier, one of the few places in
which he had felt a real encounter
with the basic issues and values of
contemporary times and of all time
has been in a Bible class.

This is a strong indictment
against us and should cause us
to question what we consider
to be the important values. We
may be amazed st what we
find out, but it may help
change a grievous situation
that casts a mark against the
Davidson student. In times
such as these one can not 4f-
ford to let an attitude of con-
cern or unawareness kill his
potential contribution for good
in the world.

ing Freshmen have contributed to
the flippant attitude with which
the Freshmen have regarded the
Court. Also, a date for termination
of the Court’s activities has been
set in the hope that Freshmen will
continue to respect the Court up
to that time: heretofore, the Fresh-
men have had only a vague idea of
when they would come out from
under the yoke of the Court and
consequently tried to- rebel as early
as _ possible.

(3) Freshmen will no longer be
required to remain in their chapel
seits until upperclassmen have left
the aucitorium. This change is
made in the hope that the crics of
“Down Freshmen” will be at least
partially eliminated. thereby aug-
menting the dignity of chapel.

INDIVIDUAL ATIENTION

(4) The members of the Court
will consider it part of their job
to help individual Freshmen make
needed adjustments If real prob-
lems arise that can be handled, in

Question: In view of the recent
decision of the Board of Trustees
concerning an ineraase in enroll-
ment, wha? steps to that end, and
to the end pf enlarging the physi-
cal plant in preparation, must be
taken in the. foreseeable future?
Do plans still include the razing
of Georgia Dormitory?

Answer: According to the Report
of the Committee of Population
Trends, Davidson College, Feb.
ruary 7, 1956, a report: drawn up
and submitted by five members of.
the College Faculty and Adminis-
tration and approved by the Joint
Trustees-Faculty Committee on

‘Population Trends, the estimated

cost of additions to plant and
equipment to provide for a stu-
dent body of one thousand would
be $524,000. The enlarged plant
and additional equipment and their
respective costs ure -as follows:
One dormitory (120 Students at

$2400), $288.00000; Addition to
Library, $150,000.00; Additional
Fraternity Houses, $36,000.00;

Changes in Food Service, $20,000.-
00; Faculty Offices and equipment,
$20,000.00: Miscellaneous (Parking,
other buildings, ete.), $10,000.00.
The Committee recommended that
the forementioned steps be taken
to provide necessary additions to
the present plant and equipment
for a student enrollment of one
thousand. An increase in endow-
ment and Faculty salary is alse
prerequisite to a sizeable enlarge-
ment of the student body.

Regarding the razing of Georgia
Dormitory, the answer of today
is yes, unless action is taken by
the Trustees later which would re-
quire holding it for temporary use.

Question: Why are “review per-
tods” as such included in the
yearly calendar? Are they merely
suggested periods for reviews, or
are they to be followed strictly? Is
there a rule that professors must
announce a review at least one
week prior to its being given?

Answer: The review periods as
printed in the yearly calendar

private better than in chapel, the
members of the Court will be ex.
pected to follow the necessary
course.

If the Court regains its place in
chapel, its success will depend a
great deal upon the attitude of the
rising Sophomore class and upon
the publicity given to the Fresh-
men and the upperclassmen. The
Wildeat Handbook will present a
full account of the purposes and
functions of the Court which the
Freshmen will read before they
reach the campus. During Orienta-
tion period the Judge of the Court
will have a scheduled part on the
program.

The upperclassmen will re-
ceive instruction in a chapel
talk and in Davidsonian ar-
ticles All publicity will stress
the fact that if the Court is re-
turned to chapel, as we believe
it must be in order to success-
fully operate, it must be re-
garded as existing fer con-
structive and ssrious purposes.

ah

serve mainly as guides far pro-
fessors; they are not to be con-
-idored dogmatic. The suggested
periods are applicable only to
ireshmen and sophomores and
serve as a guide for the faculty in
that the closing day of the review
periods marks the beginning of
peparation in collecting and send-
ing out grades. For that reason,
there were two review periods in
the first semester and, since grades
are to be issued only once in the
Spring term, there will be one
review period around the middle
of second semester. The review
periods serve, moreover, as guides
organizations and_ students
whose activities are scheduled to
minimize conflicts throughout the
suggested review period.
Customarily the professors do
announce a forthcoming review
several class lectures in advance.
There is no statute requiring them
to do so, but generally speaking,
ample notice is usually given.

Question: In regard to the dor-
mitory at present under construc-
tion: is it on schedule, so as to
render possible its completion by
next September? Hes 8 name for
it been determined?

. Answer: The new dormitory is
about six weeks behind the sched-
ule, due to the unusually bad
weather during the period since
the beginning of construction. The
contractor, Barger Construction
Co., is making every effort to make
up for some of this loss of time.

Whether the new dormitory can
be completed in time for the open-
ing of College in September will
depend to a large extent on the
weather and the delivery of cer-
tain necessary building materials
such as steel, built-in furniture,
ete.

Barring unusual difficulty along
those lines it would appear that
the dormitory will be ready for
occupancy in September.

No nanie has been assigned to
the new dormitory.
