Still Whistlin' Dixie

Country
music comes
in the mail

By Geoff Graham

Ino longer haveacar. Aftera
hundred and fifty thousand miles
of faithful service, over dirt, gravel,
mud, and maybe some asphalt, my
little darlin’ collapsed. I tried to
nurse her back, but my well ran
dry. It breaks my heart that some-
thing as petty as money could be
the only factor separating twosouls
so deeply devoted to each other.
Someone with the means to save
her battered engine offered and,
for her sake, I couldn’t refuse. I
had to let her go. It was the worst
day of my summer. I loved the
‘poor thing and Ican only hope her
newowner is as kind and forgiving
as I tried to be.

In any case, Inolonger havea
car. This makes it extremely diffi-
cult to acquire new CDs. What’s
that you say? The Book Store?
Oh, I know they’ve got some great
albums, but I already own the
Country one. I’m left with two
options: the radio ora €D club.
Considering my roommate’s tuner
works only on the third Tuesday of
each month, I’ve opted for the lat-
ter.

If you haven’t joined BMG
yet, get your tail in gear. The
introductory incentiveis eight CDs
for the price of one with no fur-
ther obligation. After that, you
can usually buy two or three for a
total of just fifteen bucks, still with-
out obligation, If you never pay,
they don’t even yell at you! They
simply stop letting you buy stuff.
The only problem is it takes six to
ten weeks for delivery.

I just received Dwight
Yoakam’s “new” one yesterday,
and though it may be six to ten
weeks late, I thought I’d let y’all
know how the boy’s doing. Well,
sad tosay, he’s gone downhill since
his break-up with Sharon Stone.
This Time is nowhere near the cali-
bre of his /f There WasA Way. It’s
obvious Dwight is capable of a lot
more. The song-writing ability
that produced “I Sang Dixie,” “It
Only Hurts WhenI Cry,” and “The
Heart That You Own” is still there
somewhere, he’s just heartbroken.
Can you blame him?

There are a few songs worth
mentioning, however. “Ain’t That
Lonely Yet” has been on the radio
(my radio at home works). It’s
another vindictive song in the tra-_
dition of “You’re the One.” Here
Dwight sings his best lyrics of the
album. Ironically, it’sthe only one
he didn’twrite. “Lonesome Roads”
is a true cowboy tune. Simple
lyrics follow a slow flat-picking
rhythm. It belongs on a lonely trail
somewhere. “Two Doors Down”
is another sad drinkin’ song that’s
not hard to like. “Try Not to Look
So Pretty,” the best song on the

Textured, abstract canvases set Jackson apart

By Carey Thompson

Before I walked into the Van
Every Gallery in the Visual Arts
Center, I had an idea of what to
expect, knowing each of the three
entirely different styles ofart work,
but not how the art would look
together. What I observed was a
show which works incredibly well,
from Herb Jackson’s large, tex-
tured, abstract canvases to Russ
Warren’s energetic, narrative can-
vases, to Cort Savage’s kineti@and
audible sculptures. According to
Jackson, “the issue of quality is
what binds them together.” War-
ren made a similar comment that
the common bond for the show
was each of the artist’s particular
“attention to craft.”

Jackson’s work is the most
familiar to me as a result of my
internship at the Jerald Melberg
Gallery. This summer, [observed

several other American artists rep-
resented by Melberg. This experi-
ence gave mea strong sense of the
visual world which Jackson cre-
ates in his canvases, oil crayon
drawings, monoprints, and etch-
ings.’ A great deal of up-close
examination led me to an under-
standing of the careful crafting
which he puts into his work. Every
time I ran into a Jackson this sum-
mer, I stopped at the familiar style

“ to find out what his work was about

through each new and different
image. ¥
For those who are unfamiliar
with his work, Jackson’s paintings
may at first appear abstract and
unreadable. The longer a viewer
looks, however, the more shapes
and forms emerge through the color
differentiation to become readable
visual language. The monumental
canvases in the show, especially
Vulcan’s Gate, have so much

power in them that I felt I was
looking into another world which
at any moment might have allowed
me to step into it.

Atension occurs between tex-
ture and the visual space in
Jackson’s paintings. The textured
marks of the scraped surface sug-
gesting a three dimensional land-
scape are but one aspect of these
canvases. This result occurs due to
the scraped surface of 50 to 100
layers of paint which sometimes
has mica or pumice added to it.
Colors and shapes create tension
between positive and negative
space; they show whether particu-

: larareas can be read as foreground

and background or can participate
on the same plane.

What to me is visually stimu-
lating about Jackson’s canvases is
the play of complementary colors
in layers against each other, the
shapes that disappear and re-

his work daily among the work of

Movie Review

"True Romance"

By Scott McLean

You know, every once in a
while a movie comes along that
you’re not able to make heads or
tails of, and I have to say that this
week’s featured flick pulled anum-
ber on me.

While “True Romance” is a
fairly straightforward film, I left
the theater feeling more loopy than
a Sheri curl. This is the second
effort from writer/director Quentin
Tarantino whose last film “Reser-
voir Dogs” caused quite a buzz
throughout Hollywood (I haven’t
seen this one, but after “Romance”
I must admit that my interest is
aroused).

Perhaps the peculiarity of my
experience with “True Romance”
was the fact that Tarantino did not
direct hisownscriptthis time out...
or maybe I was just tired, who
knows?

Anyway, here’s the deal:

IS

Christian Slater is Clarence
Worley, a mega Elvis fan who
meets his “true love” Alabama
(Patricia Arquette) at a kung-fu
movie marathon and marries her
the next day..

As it turns out, Alabama is a
hooker whois itching (I ain’tgonna
touch this pun) to get away from
her pimp Drexel (Gary Oldman), a
gun-toting, drug-crazed psycho
with mob connections. When
Clarence goes to inform Drexel
that Alabama will no longer be his
employee, he ends up offing the
pimp and accidentally steals asuit-
case full of cocaine.

The two then make a run for
California to get rid of the drugs
with the mob in full pursuit. What
ensues is one part “Thelma and
Louise,” one part “Raising Ari-
zona,” and two parts “Midnight
Run.”

You may think that with ele-

full of surprises

ments of all these hit films com-
bined into one movie it would be
just too cool for words, but the
reality is a mini-mash which you
are either going to love or hate.
Don’t get me wrong— Slater and
Arquette are in top form and the
cameos by Dennis Hopper, Chris-
topher Walken, Brad Pitt, Bronson
Pinchot, and Val Kilmer are all
excellent. —

If that isn’t enough, the
shootout scene at the end is one of
the best I’ve ever seen, but in the
end it really is a coin toss. Scott
says watch and judge for your-
selves— there’s sex, guns, and
love, and if one of those doesn’t
turn you on then I guess you’ re just
out of luck.

Y’all stay tuned now, ‘cause
things will be getting interesting
on the film front in the next couple
of weeks, but until then, take care
and see you at the movies!

emerge within the thick surface,
those which move on and off the
edge of the canvas, the contrasting
organic andstatic shapes, andsmall
lines and large forms playing off
each other. This amazing varia-
tion leads the viewer into the paint-
ing and one can view it on a differ-
ent level every time one observes
it. From every angle, there is an
aspect which holds the attention of
the eye. For example in Anchor,
the strong solid flatness of the dark
blue is juxtaposed with the danc-
ing, fiery red-orange shapes and
the fluid rhythm in the turquoise.
Strong, solid, weighty shapes of
dark blue contrast with shapes such
as the elegant thin green curve,
cutting across the upper portion of
the painting, which leads the eye
into yet another area of the picture
plane.

In some areas recognizable
images seem to emerge and then
recede into a relation with other
shapes, disappearing into another
level within the picture plane. Pic-
tures within pictures are created in
the varying sizes of the marks on
the canvasand in the paint on planes
of color. The eye moves from one
shape to the next—what could bea
small picture in itself expands asa
part ofa larger form, until the whole
canvas is viewed in totality. Each
varyingly textured area has itsown
intensity, and at the same time all
are interrelated to form the whole—
like mentally putting together a
visual puzzle.

Jackson’s canvases are “inde-
terminate in terms of thematic con-
tent.” The titles suggest some type
of story is related to the paintings;
however, a painting emerges out
of the process—from events that
happen over weeks and months
while he is working on it. The
paintings “are really about creat-
ing new entities, not about tellinga
story.” Dark Angel, for example,
was a response to the Gulf War. |
The visual dimension Jackson cre-
ates cannot be put into words; it is
another form of communication
which is above and beyond verbal
description. Jackson seems to use
alanguage of hisown tocommuni-
cate visually with the viewer
through the canvas. No blatantly
apparent figurative elements or
emotions bounce off the canvas,
but a type of serene, powerful,
steady communication occurs with
the viewer in this visual experi-

ence.

The show is a reflection of
the diversity of Davidson’s studio
art faculty. Jackson views the
diversity of each of the three types
of art work as “really like points of
a triangle,” the idea behind the
faculty’s diversity—that each stu-
dent will feel “there is someone he
or she can relate to aesthetically.”
The work provides asense of what
each of the artists is about. Each
professor’s work is strong on its
own, and at the same time does not
disrupt the power of the others’ in
the show. As a whole, the exhibit
reveals the differing approaches of
each artist to different visual prob-
lems, and attests to Davidson’s
exceptional faculty.
