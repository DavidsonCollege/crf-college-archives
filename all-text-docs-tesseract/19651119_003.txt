Applicants See System
As Big ‘Drawing Card’

Commenting on the effect of incomin g freshmen by the honor system and its
responsibilities, Davidson’s Director of Admissions, H. Edmunds White, stated that
the system represents for the most part a radical difference from the freshmen’s ex-

periences in either high school or prep school.

Their awareness of the sys-
tem and the conduct that is
expected of them begins with
the first interview at David-
son. ;
White feels that the system js
Strong and effective, and it is
one of the strongest drawing
cards that the school has to of-
fer. The applicants’ reaction to
the honor system is one of re-
spect, and that this carries over
to their entrance as students.

He feels that it is important
that each new student recog-
nize the responsibility of honor
that is placed in him because

this insures the continuation of
an important tradition.

White also feels that the
Freshmen must be ready to
make an important adjustment
in this new atmosphere of added
responsibility and personal re-
Straint. In attracting prospec-
tive freshmen the honor system
remains a strong selling point
that makes Davidson unique.

White emphasized that there
must be adequate preparation
for educating the new students
in the responsibility of the sys-
tem with emphasis on the pen-
alty involved in a breach of the

adds to the general prestige and
reputation that draws outstand-

When the prospective fresh-
men receives his letter of -ac-
ceptance he also receives two
copies of a pledge or state-
ment which spells out the spirit
of the honor system. He is ex.
pected to sign this pledge and
return it with his acceptance as
a member of the entering fresh-
men class.

This has no special legal sig-
nificance, but is in effect, a re-
affirmation of the principles of
the honor system and the stu-
dent's intent to abide by them.
The pledge is drawn up by the
Office of the Dean of Students.

This pledge ties in with his
responsibility concerning student
conduct, and the school's at-
tempt to educate the incoming
freshmen in the system. Thus
the college begins early the at-

the importance of the system
and their responsibility.

For Reform

Received At Open End

By WALT DRAKE
Davidsonian Feature Writer
The procedures, punish-

ments and publicity of Dav-
idson’s honor system came
under close scrutiny a\
Wednesday night’s Open
End.

Several changes in these areas
were suggested by some of the
sixty students who attended the
program heid in the union. Hon-
or Court chairman Jim Stokes
and senior honor court members
Joe Davis and John Burks an-
swered questions presented to
them by the students and dis-
cussed possible changes in the
honor system.

Jack Martens stated early in
the discussion that he objected
to the court having to dismiss
from the college all students
found guilty of an honor offense.
He suggested that an anolyst
be hired by the college to work
with students convicted of break-
ing the honor system.

Bill Trotter questioned wheth-
er the whole honor system was
designed to ‘dispense justice or
reap vengence.” He said that
the court should take into ac-
count more the life and future
of a person convicted of break-
ing an honor regulation.

Ken Childs suggested that ‘a
system of justice should be
based on more pragmatic
means.” He said that he favor-
ed a system whereby the court
would look at a specific incident
and then decide on the penalty. ’

He further suggested that
some cases be referred to the
student counseling service to
render help to the person who
commits an honor offense.

Childs later added that “We've
got to abandon the concept of
punishment for someone doing
something wrong, unless it will
help him."

It was suggested by Wayne
Mixon that a psychiatrist be
brought to Davidson to talk with
members of the honor court and
tell them what the role of a

psychiatrist could be in such a
system. ‘Martens added that
such systems were now being
used at MIT and Harvard.

Stokes commented that he
hoped an open end or chapel
program could be arranged to
enable a psychiatrist to speak
to the court and the student body
about the role of a psychiatrist
in an honor system.

Ed Armfield, junior member
of the honor court, mentioned
the convenience offered by the
honor system in allowing stu-
dents to leave books on campus
without fear of them being
stolen and the convenience for
professors of not having to stay
in a room throughout an exam-
ination.

Pete Bondanella stated that
he did not believe his conven-
ience was worth the damage
done to one man if a mistake
was made in conviction. He de-
fined the main problem as one
of the severity of the punish-
ment.

Upon requests from the audi-
ence, Stokes produced figures
which showed that since 1959,
twenty-four persons have been
tried by the honor court for
honor offenses. Twelve of these
persons have been acquitted and
twelve have been dismissed
from the college.

Bondanella pointed out what
he called “a built-in prejudice
in the honor court’ in that the
same persons that investigate
cases also try the cases. Stokes
agreed that this area needed a
change and he mentioned sev-
eral of the suggested changes
that are presently being con-
sidered by members of the hon-
or court.

The first one of these sugges-
tions would be the election of
an additional senior to the court.
Then, for each month, two sen-
iors would serve as investigators
of any case coming before the
court. a

They would present their find-
ings if the case came to trial.

However, they would have no
vote in the verdict of the court.

Stokes also mentioned the pos-
sibility of having one member of
the student. council set as de-
fense counselor for all persons
called before the court. This
counselor. would advise the de-
fendant of his rights and help
him build and present his case
to the court.

Condemning the severity of the
punishment of dismissal and
pointing out the threat of the
draft immediately facing a stu-
dent dismissed [rom school. Jim
‘Walkup suggested that convict-
ed students be punished by fines
or being ‘worked to death for a
while, perhays as janitors.”

Murray Smith stated that
most of the student body is
ignorant of how the honor court
works and should be taught the
court. procedure. Stokes said
that mimeographed booklets will
be distributed to the student
body to explain the philosophy
behind the honor court and the
procedure of the trials to clear
up this lack of. knowledge on the
students’ part.

The possibility of a mock trial
being conducted before the stu-
dent body was also suggested by
Stokes. .

Another question arising was
whether results of the trials
should be made available to stu-
dents. Stokes stated that the
preference of the members of
the court is that they publish
the results, facts and reasons
behind their decision in a trial.

Jay Federman suggested that
a short summation of each case
be published in THE DAVID-
SONIAN, with further informa-
tion made available upon re-
quest.

However, several students felt
that this would distort the case,
and that either all of the facts
and circumstances should be
presented or none at all. Joe
Davis said that he felt that pub-
lieation of a case should be de-
cided upon by the person in-
volved in the offense.

system you set up,’ he said,
and the court is the body au-
thorized by the student body to
weigh evidence of honor viola-
tions and to determine guilt.

The ‘idea of the court stands
or falls with that of the honor
system, and Stokes felt that the.
honor system would remain un-

: less serious opposition to it

community of students has de-
cided (hat it wants to have an: &

the traits of honesty and integ-
rity among its members.

“If this spirit isn’t a part of

Each student helps himself by
living up to the code and helps.
others live up to the code by
expecting honorable action from
’ them.

The real duty of the court in
such a system is not only to
evaluate violations, but also to
be sure that the ideal of the
honor code is present before the
students and to conduct an on-
going appraisal of the systems’
operations.

As part of its program of
education and information, the
court held an Open End discus-
sion of objections to the honor
court on Wednesday night. ask-
ing for suggestions (see adja-

copies of the booklet. ‘‘The

by the beginning of next week.
These booklets were prepared
this past summer, but finances
permitted only 500 to be printed.
Half of these were given to the
freshmen, and many others were
given to the faculty.

“If we can get people to con-
tinue to be as interested in the
system as they are now, it would
be more valuable to the whole
student body.”

The court hopes also to give a
full explanation of trial proce-
dures in a DAVIDSONIAN ar-
ticle in the near future. Many of
these may soon be altered. how-

JIM STOKES
Court Chairman

Chairman Jim Stokes review-
ed for THE DAVIDSONIAN
Wednesday some of the changes
the court hopes soon to bring
about, many of them to take ef-
fect by next semester and the
others by the fall semester of
next year. He emphasized that
these were the best revisions
the court had found, but that
suggestions from students would
be seriously entertained.

The most radical change
would be to split the function
of the present court into two
separate functions, delegating
one to a separate committee to
be formed under the Student
Council and reserving the other
for Honor Court jurisdiction.

Those cases to be reviewed
by the newly-created committee
would involve infractions of the
Student Body Regulations (no
drinking, no gambling, etc.).
These now fall within the pur-
view of the Honor Court.

With these cases deleted, the
Honor Court would be able to

Honor Code alone — cheating,
lying under oath—

suspension from school.

This change developed out of
the court’s summer study of ma-
terial that has been collected

buckle (class of °64) chaired
