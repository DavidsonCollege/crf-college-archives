THE DAVIDSONIAN CAMPUS LIVING = MoNDAY, JANUARY 27, 1992

Phi. & Eu.

tance as male education” to “is
slavery a curse or a blessing to the
people of the United States”.
During meetings, rigid discipline
was enforced.

Fines were given for nearly
anything. For example, ten cent
fines were issued for wearing a hat
in the Phi room, sitting in an
“unbecoming position,” for “
smoking... reading, eating, chew-
ing,” and for “spitting onthe floor”.
Apparently, chewing tobacco was
a common pastime, and the floor
tended to get rather messy. In-
stead, members would spit out the
windows, which proved hazard-
ous for anyone walking by.

Although different from the
fraternity experience of today, the
literary societies had great appeal.
Everyone on campus joined either
Phi or Eu, which naturally led to
some rivalry. On one occasion, the
entire membership of Eu threat-
ened to leave if they did not get as
many dorm rooms as the Phi
members had. Students tended to
be fiercely loyal to the societies,
even at the expense of the school.

Inanother incredible move, the
whole of both groups left campus

(with the exception of two stu-
dents) in protest of the unfair sus-
pension of one of their peers. This
loyalty, though divisive at times,
led to a great deal of livelihood and
solidarity that the students other-
wise would be without. Perhaps
the greatest show of solidarity are
the gravestones in the Davidson
cemetery bearing the seals of the
twosocieties, erected by each group
when their members died.

Unquestionably, the societies
became the center of life for the
student body, and even acted as a
student government. Eu went so
far as to inform the faculty that
they had expelled one student for
plagiarism. They didn’t expel him
from just Eu, however; they ex-
pelled him from the college.

Of course, the main focus
always remained on literature and
debate, with the secretaspects soon
dying out. In 1870, the groups
together sponsored The Davidson
Monthly, which featured original
articles and works, and later ex-
panded to include news and other
items of interest. It died in 1872,
but was revived again in 1886,
became the Davidson College
Magazine in 1897, and continued
to be sponsored and paid for by the
societies until 1916, when the col-
lege began to finance it.

The greatest contributions of
the literary societies to the college
would easily be Phi and Eu Halls,
located between Cunningham and
DCPC. These buildings were
constructed in 1849 with funds
raised by the students themselves,
and were lavishly furnished. For
example, the chandelier in the
upstairs of Phi Hall is a duplicate
of the one Napoleon was married
under, and was displayed at the
first World’s Fair. The college
expended vast amounts of money
to restore the buildings in 1921,
1937, and 1957, and will again
renovate Phi within the next few
years. ,

Not to be underestimated,
however, are the great libraries of
the literary societies, which were
built up as references for the de-
bates and essays they required.
These libraries grew to enormous
proportions. Phi’s library, for in-
stance, grew by 1846 to over 1,000
volumes, which were entirely paid
for by the membership dues. In
1886, these libraries were com-
bined with the meagre college li-
brary into a collection of over
10,000 books. Society dues con-
tinued, however, to pay for new
books until the turn of the century.
As a tribute to these early roots,
Little Library has the insignia of

Dr. Haavi Morreim, Associate Professor, Dept. of Human Values and
Ethics, University of Tennessee, will be speaking on Feb. 3 at 4:30
pm in the Morrison Room. Her talk is titled "Should Your Doctor or
Your Family Decide the Moment of Your Death?" All students,
faculty, and staff are encouraged to attend.

The traditions of Davidson
College have been indelibly
marked by the literary societies.
At one time, the societies com-
pletely ran the Commencement
ceremony, securing speakers,
paying for bands; leading the pro-
cessions, and holding debates. The
societies even gave.out diplomas
of their own, which at one point
carried nearly as much weightasa
Davidson diploma!

The diplomas are still con-
ferred, but the only vestige of the
Commencement left to the socie-
ties are the Marshals, who now
only lead and seat the processing
seniors. These Marshals still wear
sashes, pink for Eu and blue for
Phi, and carry the original proces-
sional canes. The tradition of giv-
ing the sash to the girl of the
Marshall’s choice ended in 1896,
however.

By that time, the grand days of
Phi and Eu were waning. They
were no longer secret organiza-
tions, and their positions as centers
of student lifeand government were
debased. Fraternities, six strong in
1896, rapidly took over the social
life of the students. Trains ran
through the growing town of
Davidson, and the college curricu-

lum had greatly expanded to in-
clude the debate and research that
previously made the societies so
appealing. The size of the socie-
ties gradually dwindled, hovering
at around twenty members each
for much of the twentieth century,
and even dipping’so low as to ren-
der one or the other defunct at
times.

Today, the societies are mere
shells of what they once were. Only
the Philanthropic Society meets
now, on Sundaysatnine. Although
the meetings are much more infor-
mal, the focus remains on its motto,
“verite sans puer” (truth without
fear), with the emphasis as always
on literature and some public pres-
entation.

Soon Eumenean will be re-
vived, however; then perhaps the
debates that used to rage from the
balconies of each hall will again be
heard, the Commencements will
regain some of their former flash
and pomp, and a new interest will
grow in the literature and creativ-
ity historically fostered by the for-
merly great literary societies of
Davidson College.
