Three Predecessors

Davidsonian Managing Editor

Before the first DAVIDSONIAN came off the presses
on April 1, 1914, three other newspapers had had their

short lives at Davidson.

The first of these was The
Davidsen Cellege Enterprise,
which appeared in 1883 and
lasted only one year. It was
edited by R. G. Sparrow, who
lived in Davidson and later en-

tered Davidson College, class of
88, where he was a brilliant
student. The Enterprise was
edited independently by Spar-
row and had no connection with
the college despite its name. It
was advertised as ‘one of the
cheapest weeklies in the world”
at 75 cents per year.

Timely Topics, the second of
the three, was edited by the
Sophomore Class in 1895 and
only one issue was put out. It
was published as an experiment
with the idea in mind of a fu.
ture college newspaper. It con-
sisted mainly of articles better
suited for a magazine format,
such as “South Carolina Cotton

Mills” or “The Hawaiian Af.
fair,” and it also contained
three poems.

writer of the story.

With such gruesome details as
“the continuous, awful hissing
of escaping steam, the hideous
shriek of women and the hope-
less, agonizing groans of the
dying,” it is easy to see why the
Southern Railroad was concern-
ed.

This week THE DAVIDSONIAN is celebrating the
occasion of its 50th volume of news and editorial report-
ing on the college campus, commemorated by this special

eight-page edition.

The paper is 50 volumes, but
not 50: years old. The first edi-

i} tion actually appeared 48 years
|ago on April 1, 1914 under the
| editorship

of Frank Wilson
Price, who is on campus today
to help celebrate the occasion.
The number of volumes ex-
exceeds the years because the
unusual campus situation in
the summer of 1944 necessi-
tated a special volume of THE
| DAVIDSONIAN. With over
| 200 students on campus in
| the ASTRP program, life went
| on just like e regular session,
including a five-issue volume
of THE DAVIDSONIAN.
This issue of the newspaper
attempts to recreate some of the
| more important and interesting
news stories and editorial fea-
tures since 1914. The interven-
| ing years have seen the paper
go to as many as 10 and 12 pages
| weekly, expand and shrink its
;column size and_ introduce
| photography and cartoons.
| For many years, THE DAV-
IDSONIAN served as campus
| nowepayer, alumni journal and
| town paper. A special section
| of each week's issue was devot-
| ed to alumni “tidbits,” or town
‘book club gatherings and the
like.
it is fitting thet this issue
of THE DAVIDSONIAN will
go once more into the home of
every living elumnus. The
alumni office hes purchased
9,500 copies fer this mailing.
Both world wars saw the
paper turn over whole pages to
reports of Davidson men in the
service and war news in general.
In turn, these periods were fol-
lowed by issues devoting exten-
sive space to pleas for peace—
the League of Nations and the
United Nations.
THE DAVIDSONIAN has al-

ways been quick to the occasion
for a special edition. Notable
“extras” through the years have
included the Woodrow Wilson
visit, the Chambers fire, the
Million Dollar Campaign. Drive,
the Davidson Centennial, Cun-
ningham's resignation, Martin's
appointment and later his inau-
guration, the famous 1960
Trustee-integration issue and
finally the present. 50th volume
commemorative edition itself

The newspaper has not been
lacking in favorable recogni-
tion through the years either.
The North Carolina Collegiate
Press Association honored
THE DAVIDSONIAN es “the
best paper in the state” for
two consecutive years, 1924
and 1925. These were the
first two years the organiza-
tion was in existence.

During the 1920's and early
‘30's, THE DAVIDSONIAN. ac-
quired the tag of “The Best
College Newspaper In_ the
South.” The Associated Colleg-
iate Press joined the band-
wagon in declaring the paper an
“All-American,” its highest pos-
sible distinction, for the first
time in 1937.

That distinction has been one
maintained consistently by the
paper since that time, the most
recent “All-American” coming

THE DAVIDSONIAN began
hesitatingly, as most institutions
begin hesitatingly. Many ques-
tions arose, questions such as
“Why a college weekly? Does it
have a real value? What will it
stand for?’ Opposition arose.
Opposition on the ground that
there wasn't enough news to fill
four pages.

But Frank Price and his staff
knew better. They saw the pos-
sibility and value of a college
paper at Davidson. They ignored
the dissenters and went to work.

Frank Price had ambitious
plans for THE DAVIDSON-
IAN. He envisioned the news-
paper as the unifying agent in
an increasingly diversified
student body. “Even in a
small college, life becomes
more and more complex .. .
The college newspaper should
... keep (every college group)
acquainted with each other,

and thus promote a feeling of
mutual interest and encour-

agement.”

attention. But he still found

time to speak briefly to Wil-

Davidson College. The inter-

story in that first issue of

THE DAVIDSONIAN.

“Hak-a-rak-a-boom-a-lack! The
baseball season has been usher-
ed in, and during the past few
days the varsity has been get-

Cook is satisfied that the Red
and Black Machine will come

Sports, too, occupied a place
of prominence in Volume 1,

College Days At Davidson

MANY OTHER NOTABLES
SEEN

Despite the fact that Presi-
dent Wilson is exceedingly busy
at this time, owing to the critical
situation ip Mexico and the
question of the repeal of the
Canal Tolls, which among many
other important matters, are re-
quiring his close attention just
now, President Martin, through
the kindness of Senator Over-
man, in securing a
short in ew with the Presi-
dent on last Thursday, March 26.

After waiting for about thirty :
minutes, President Martin was
cordially greeted by Mr. Wilson,
who laid aside heavier matters
of State to recall pleasantly for
a few moments his college days
at Davidson and to enquire (sic)
about the institution as it is at
present. He spoke of President
Martin's father, whom he fami-
liarly called “Colonel” Martin
and of his two sons, showing
that he still intimately recalled
even the small matters of his
college days. He also expressed
regret that ill health had com-
pelled his withdrawal from
Davidson at the end of his fresh-
man year. This is a clear ex-
planation of the facts connected
with his leaving, which is a
matter that has not been fully
understood by everyone before.
After a word about Mrs. Wil-
son’s brother, Professor Axson
of Princeton, who was also @
Davidson Freshman and a clags-
mate of President Martin, a
hearty handshake and a mutual
expression of good wishes, the
visit was over.

It was only a short interview,
but characterized by directness,
simplicity and cordiality. Presi-
dent Martin, in speaking of Mr.
Wilson, said: “Mr. Wilson is to
me better looking than his pic-
tures, though they are exceed-
ingly like him. He gives you the

— CRITICISM —

It would be an abnormal
newspaper that did not elicit
much comment upen its first
*ppearence. THE DAVID-
SONIAN will suffer the same
fate. You will talk about it as
seon as you see it, and again
when you have read it. But
there is criticism and criti-
cism. The criticism that is
sinister, careless and thought-
less will injure the paper;
the criticism that is open,
helpful and thoughtful will
do more than anything else
to build it up. We ask for
your criticism, free, candid
