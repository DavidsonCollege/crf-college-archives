Forum examines economy,
politics as crisis unfolds

KaTE KELLY
News Editor

Gathering in the C. Shaw Smith
900 Room on Monday evening, the
Young Democrats and College Re-
publicans sponsored their second
Political Connection Discussion.
Monday’s discussion centered on
the topic of the economy and its
roll in the upcoming presidential
election.

A more appropriate topic could
not have been chosen as Monday
signaled one of the major turn-
ing points in our country’s current
economic crisis. On Monday, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average lost
777.68 points (6.98%), the largest
point decline in the history of the
Dow. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ex-
perienced significant losses as well,
creating the largest declines for ma-
jor market indices since 1987.

This unforeseen dip in the Dow
came as a shock to the two featured
panelists: Dr. Clark Ross, Vice

President for Academic Affairs,
Dean of Faculty and the Frontis W.
Johnston Professor of Economics

and Dr. Fred Smith, Associate Pro-
fessor of Economics. Both panel-
ists admitted that they went to bed
Sunday night expecting the Con-
gressional Bailout Bill to pass and
the markets to regain lost ground
on Monday.

This economic shock facing
our country stems from a combina-
tion of factors, the largest being the
lack of federal regulation of new
economic instruments (i.e. mort-
gage packages). The United States’
focus on home ownership pres-
sures many individuals into signing
up for mortgage packages without
fully understanding their ramifica-
tions.

Smith shared that as he recently
went through buying a new home
in Davidson, he had some ques-
tions about the paperwork as well.
“Even as a Ph.D. economist, these
markets are very complicated,”
Smith said.

The complexity in the new
mortgage markets puts many
Americans at risk for falling victim

Labyrinth proposal geared to relieve stress

Maura McGinn
Staff Writer

Students at Davidson College
are well acquainted with stress. Al-
though many have already devel-
oped their own tactics to manage
anxieties, a new outlet will soon
become available for the Davidson
community in the form of a laby-
rinth.

On Sunday evening, in a discus-
sion themed “Life is not Linear,”
College Chaplain Robert Spach
84, Lauren Cunningham ’09 and
Dr. Trisha Senterfitt, spoke in the
900 Room about Davidson’s plans
to build the stress-reliever.

Guest speaker Senterfitt re-
ceived her doctorate in Ministry
from Columbia Theological Semi-
nary in Decatur and wrote her dis-
sertation on labyrinths.

She claimed tht the 180 degree
turns made when taling a labyrinth
relieve stress.

For this reason, the benefits of
a labyrinth walk exceed those of a
standard walk down Main Street.

She suggested that the act of
walking a labyrinth engages the
right side of the brain, the side that
manages creativity and imagina-
tion.

A student reflects in the tempo ary labyrinth

the Union.

The labyrinth aims to reduce stress and promote creativity.

In doing this, a balance is cre-
ated between the right side and the
left, which, on hte other hand, is
utilized most frequently by the typ-
ical college student bogged down
by mathematical equations and es-
says.

Senterfitt cited the success of
labyrinths in the treatment of pa-
tients with neurological disorders
due to this balance in brain func-
tion.

Furthermore, she said she be-

GreenPrint Initiative to
address waste management

FRANCISCO FIALLO
Staff Writer

The Student Government Asso-
ciation announced the GreenPrint
Initiative, an effort to improve the
environmental impact of the col-
lege’s operations, at its meeting last
Thursday. The initiative is a collab-
orative effort between the Environ-
mental Action Coalition (EAC), the
Buildings and Grounds Committee
and Sustainability Fellow Kealy
Devoy 08.

Under the leadership of Sonia
Huang ’10, the initiative has iden-
tified four areas of concern: paper,
utilities, recycling, and edibles. She
said she hopes to begin substantial
work on measuring and reducing
waste generated in those areas. As
that work progresses, GreenPrint
will also be introducing a series of
flyers and social artwork intended
to raise students’ awareness of

waste and its repercussions.

Fountain Walker, Chief of Cam-
pus Safety, also attended the meet-
ing to respond to any lingering con-
cerns over the behavior of campus
safety officers at Martin Court dur-
ing and after First Night Down. He
urged students to provide prompt
feedback should any future inci-
dents occur, so that any improper
behavior could be addressed.

He also pointed out that stu-
dents’ concerns were not new or
unusual and that both students and
officers would acclimate to proper
enforcement of the alcohol policy.
In response to a question over what
appeared to be a large number of
officers present at Martin Court,
Walker replied that there has al-
ways been one officer present for
every 100 students expected to be
at registered parties.

lieves so firmly in the importance
of the labyrinth that her husband
constructed one in their backyard.

She finds comfort in walk-
ing the labyrinth to reflect, to give
thanks and to relax.

Senterfit has lofty goals for the
Davidson labyrinth. She envisions
some students taking regular medi-
tative walks and others utilizing
the structure around more stressful
times such as exam period.
