Relief efforts raise $17, 000

By KATE GILLESPIE
News Editor

Hurricane Katrina relief efforts
held at Davidson last week resulted
in $17,000 in donations to the
American Red Cross. The music
department’s 12-hour music
marathon raised $12,406.97, while
the Community Service Office’s
fundraiser and Patterson Court’s
“Beads for the Bayou” brought in
$4,358.81 and $820.63 respective-
ly.

The Residence Life Office also
collected 32 packs of 24-liter water
bottles, over 750 diapers, six large
containers of baby formula, and
two First Aid kits from the lounges
of residence halls.

Although many people wished
that they could contribute more
than just money, there was still a
high level of participation from the
Davidson campus.

“The great frustration for people
who want to reach out is that at this
point the only thing anyone can do
is raise money,” President Bobby
Vagt said. “This is a campus of
doers. It’s hard to just raise money
and money when it’s people and
lives and futures. The principal

product of our community service
[at Davidson] is not funds but peo-
ple engaged personally.”

The organizers of campus
fundraisers were particularly excit-
ed by the outcome of the fundrais-
ers.

“When a small group of us
stayed around after the marathon to
count the money, we just couldn’t
believe it as we kept sorting out the
bills and adding up the checks,”
said Associate Professor of Music
Neil Lerner, who organized the

music marathon. “Going into it, I'd
have been pleased if we'd raised:a
couple thousand dollars. I never
imagined we’d fill up all 48 slots
and average over $1000 an hour.”

Much of the money raised
through the marathon came from
anonymous donors. Controller and
Director of Business Services Ed

First-years experience First Night Down

By COLLEEN MCKown
Staff Writer

Patterson Court opened last
Friday with First Night Down. The
annual event, which usually takes
place on the third Friday in first
semester, is the first time that first-

year students are allowed to attend
parties on Patterson Court, at the
senior apartments, and off-campus.

Among Davidson students, First
Night Down is one of the most
anticipated events of the year.

“It is up there with Self-
Selection night,” said Sigma Alpha

Self-Selection night, when stu-
dents find out which Patterson
Court organization they are in, is a
similar party night in January.

In part, first-year students are
kept up the hill before First Night
Down to keep them away from
functions where alcohol is served.

Before attending such parties, it
is thought important to adjust to
Davidson in general.

“They need time to be first-year
students, to bond with their hall,
and to adjust both academically
and socially,” said Patterson Court
Advisor Joy Hamm.

An incident of first-year students
on Patterson Court before First
Night Down is not only a problem
because of the alcohol issue.

Unfair recruiting by eating hous-
es and fraternities could take also
place. If a first-year student goes to
a party at a house before First
Night Down, that house has an
advantage over other houses that

Gruber endorsed as Dean of Admission

Chris Gruber, Acting Dean of Admission and Financial Aid, will be
dropping the “Acting” from his title, should the Board of Trustees
adopt a recommendation as expected.

Gruber, initially hired last fall as Director of Admission to assist
then-Dean Nancy Cable, was the consensus candidate following a
competitive, nation-wide search process.

The college’s search committee unanimously recommended
Gruber for the position, and President Bobby Vagt endorsed that rec-
ommendation. Gruber, who is traveling this week, was notified of the

results last Friday.

Because the Dean of Admission is a Vice President-level position,
it must be approved by the Board of Trustees. The Executive
Committee of the Board was set to vote this afternoon in the final step

of the process.

Given the support for Gruber on campus and in the search commit-
tee’s recommendation, Vagt expressed confidence the Trustees would
officially tender Gruber the position.

Student-run restaurant
to open next Friday

By ZACH KAZIOR

Staff Writer

A yet-to-be-named restaurant
run by Davidson students will open
for business in the DuPont Room
of Vail Commons on Friday,
September 23.

Matt Hassett ’08 and Halley
Caldwell ’08 are heading up the
project because they felt it would
be a nice dining alternative for stu-
dents.

“When I was looking at colleges,
I was choosing between
Middlebury and Davidson, and
Middlebury has an upscale student-
run restaurant called Dolci,” said
Hassett. “I chose Davidson for the
weather, but I would like some-
thing like Dolci here at Davidson
because I feel that it would be a
nice third option for students.
There is not really a restaurant suit-
ed to college folk in downtown
Davidson.”

Hassett was able to make the

restaurant a reality with the help of

Director of Dining Services Dee
Phillips and the Union Board.

Hassett applied for and was
awarded the $10,000 Improve
Davidson Fund (IDF) by the
Activities Tax Council (ATC) last
April. -

The goals of the new restaurant
are to give students experience
with professional cooking; to part-
ner with international clubs provid-
ing them with no-cost events, thus
increasing their exposure; and to

give Davidson students a fun, deli-
cious alternative for dinner, which
at the same time fosters diversity
and awareness.

“I think it is a great option for
students looking to get involved in
a non-traditional activity,” Hassett
said. “It is fairly eccentric to be a
student at a small liberal arts col-
lege outside.Charlotte and also be
interested in cooking, and cooking
fairly seriously. I think those peo-
ple would have a good time togeth-
er, and since they probably would-
n’t run into each other, it will be a
good opportunity for people from
different backgrounds to meet each
other.”

Phillips, who was named spon-
sor in the grant application, will
stay on as the project’s advisor. The
restaurant will also continue to
count on the advice of Director of
the Union William Brown and
Director of Auxiliary Services
Richard Terry.

“We like it when students
express interest in our field,”
Phillips said. “It gives them a bet-
ter appreciation of what it takes to
put out a meal in front of some-
body. It gives students at Davidson
the opportunity to work with
trained chefs. Students usually
would not have that option because
there is no culinary program at the
school.”

Hassett also intends to work
closely with international aware-
