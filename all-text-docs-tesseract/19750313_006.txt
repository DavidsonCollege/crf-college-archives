_Cincy Reds Lead Boys of Spring

from a 10 day vacation in
Florida, this baseball picker
feels he has a good spring
training angle at the upcoming
baseball season. This is not to
say that I spent my whole break
going from camp to camp.
However, I do know that two
Davidson sport. nuts named
Paul Banta and Alan Edmonds
did precisely that, and their
comments and insights help
comprise this particular ar-
ticle:

NL EAST

Philadelphia Phillies--Any.
team that won’t trade Alan
Banister for Dick Allen
deserves last place in
management. However, if the
Phillies infield is as strong as
last year and the pitching isn’t
too much of a question mark,
then they have our vote for first
place. With Allen, it’s a shoo-in.

Pittsburgh Pirates--AE
comments, ‘‘They look a little
too fat and too slow for me.
Willie Stargell hit the fried
chicken hard in the off-season!’’
The Pirates are one of the
weakest teams up the middle,
but they can hit the hell out of
the ball. Regardless of whether
Steve Blass hits 22 batters in
exhibitions they’re a solid
second.

St. Louis Cardinals—Put third
for lack of interest and lack of
team.

New York Mets—Any team
that attempts to field Joe Torre,

John Milner, and Dave
Kingman at once can’t be that
sane. Realizing their situation,
they quit practice early every
day. ‘Fourth.

Montreal Expos—The only
positive thing is that they will
definitely lose at a slower rate
than the team below. Fifth.

Chicago Cubs—Phil Wrigley
runs this club just like his gum
company-chéwed up and spit
out. They’ll be lucky to win 60
games. Dead last.

NL WEST

Cincinnati Reds--Position by
position, we give them the edge
over L.A. This team appears
real loose and has the best team
up the middle in the majors with
Bench, Concepcion, Morgan,
and Geronimo. Bench’s hitting
could be affected by his writer’s
cramp he acquired in the winter
by writing black checks and
other autographs. A Close first.

Los Angeles Dodgers—
Holdouts and injuries make
their pitching suspect as is their
infield defense. Also appear
loose and confident but
predicted for second. If pitching
comes around, watch out Cincy.

Atlanta Braves—If they get a
good year out of Darrell Evans
and pick up a decent pitcher for
Dick Alen, while the rest of the
staff stays consistant, we see
the Braves as a longshot for the
division title. A BIG IF; but a

_competitive third.

Houston Astros—PB, a long

_ time Astro fan, picks them here

6-7 in the number one singles match. Davidsori
then went on to win the overall contest by a score
of 5-3. Rain cancelled Wednesday's match with

Rochester.

at fourth but wishes they were
last after viewing them at
Cocoa. Checked for pistols. as
they ‘entered, they were im-
pressed with Cesar Cedeno, who
is well-armed in more ways
than one. The most over-rated
81-81 team in baseball. Picked a
disappointing fourth.

San Francisco Giants--They
have improved their defense by
putting a stack of $100,000 at
third in place of Dave Kingman.
Hopefully, a few thousand will
come see them finish fifth this
year.

San Diego Padres—The other
teams in this division ‘‘deserve
a break today’, and this is it.
We hope the Padre outfielders
don’t strain their eyes following
the golden arches of opposition
home runs. Fans get their own
version of the “Big Mac’”’
(Willie McCovey), but that’s
about all. Sixth.

NL Pennant—Reds over L.A.
and Philly

NL Average—Ralph Garr over
Pete Rose.

NL Home Runs—Dick Allen if
he plays; if not Johnny Bench.
NL Wins—Seaver in a big
comeback.

NL Strikeouts—Steve Carloton
edges out over Seaver.

AL EAST

New York Yankees—Deep in
pitching all the way to Whitey
Ford. ‘‘Catfish” hustling-for his
money and the other players
wnat some too. He brought a
communicable disease with
him from the A’s-winning.
Yanks as loose and confident as
Reds and Dodgers. Pinstripes
all the way in the East.

Baltimore Orioles—fairly
solid, but too bad in the same
division with N.Y. Lee May
needs a super year if the Birds
are to be close. We see them 5-10
games back in second.

Boston Red Sox—Because
they have traded so much with
the Cardinals of late, the earlier
comments on the Redbirds hold
here too. Put in the first division
because of pick by Hilton
Oliver. Third.

Milwaukee _Brewers—Only
Hank Arron saves this team
from oblivion. No more 18 year
old shortstops. A dull fourth.

Cleveland Indians—Best
DH’s in the league with Frank
Robinson, John Ellis, and Oscar
Bush Gamble. No matter how
bad they play they'll still finish
above Detroit. Fifth. .

Detroit Tigers—I bet you
didn’t think there would ever be
a team like the ’62 Mets. This

team might make it into double
figures in the win column
because of the presence of Joe
Coleman. A triple figure loser
for sure. Lucky to finish the
season. Boring and by far the
worst team in baseball. Hoping
for LeF lore to steal, but only on
basepaths. A good match for
Davidson and solid 1-5 shot for
last.
AL WEST

Oakland Athletics--This team
has real problems-finding a
place for Billy Williams to play.
Latking stopper due to exit of
the fish. Bando should go un-
defeated in the heavyweight
ranks with Bill North rated as a
tough middleweight. Un-
doubtedly, still the class of
baseball. Solid first.

Texas Rangers—Billy Martin
has to pull another miracle for
them to stay close. All the
players had great years and will
be hard to repeat. Because of
lack of competition placed
second.

Minnesota Twins-Believe it

or not, these guy had a winning
record last year. Even with
Carew and Blyleven, they are a
good cure for insomnia. Third.

Kansas City Royals,
California Angels, and Chicago
White Sox—Inseparable! The
Three Stooges of Major League
Baseball.Eliminated from
baseball completely if it weren’t
for Amos Otis, Nolan Ryan, and
Wilbur Wood. Your choice as a
field‘entry for fourth, fifth and
sixth.
