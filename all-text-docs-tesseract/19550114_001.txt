Davidsonian Chooses
Ten Top News Stories
Of the Past 12 Months

By JIM BATTEN

Before 1955 outgrows his three
cornered pants, it might be a good
idea to pause to note a few of his
predecessors’ doings, as reflected
in the 1954 headlines of the David-
sonian. .

Nineteen-fifty-four, despite per-
petual claims to the contrary, was
quite an eventful year on the Da-
vidson scene, with such hereto-
fore unheard-of innovations as dor-
mitory bandits, and increased ath-
letics grants.

The year’s biggest story broke
early last March with the unex-
pected resignation of Davidson's
long-time Dean of Students, John
C. Bailey, Jr. Well-liked and deep-
ly respected by the student body,
Bailey’s resignation was a cause
for regret among Davidsonians,
past and present alike.

In the early morning of Feb-
ruary 4, while the school slept, Da-
vidson unknowingly brushed
shoulders with tragedy as bandit
Jennings Fields quietly stole
through the dormitories, making
off with $360 and a $100 wrist-
watch. Fields was later to kill one
policeman and critically wound an-
other as they attempted his arrest
in North Georgia.

Ed “Cop” Linker emerged from
his quietly inconspicuous role as
Davidson’s faithful night watch-
man, as police gave full credit for
Fields’ final capture to his alert
ness in noting the license number
of the bandit’s car while parked

on campus. Linker was honored
for his services, past and present,
in appropriate ceremonies before
the student body.

Also in February, came the ap-
pointment of Dr. C. J. Pietenpol
to the vital post of Dean of the
Faculty by the Board of Trustees
of the College. Dr: Pietenpol had
served as acting dean since Sep-
tember, 1053.

An unprecedented change of
policy came on February 26, as the
Trustees called for $85,000 in ath-
letic subsidization. This decision
stipulated that if outside contribu-
tions did not meet the quota, it
was to be supplied by the college,
a marked departure from past
policy. Met with unbridled en-
thusiasm in most quarters, many
felt that brighter days lay ahead
for the long-suffering Wildcats.

The annual spring elections saw
Floyd Feeney named to the gar-
gantuan task of heading up David-
son’s student government. The

“Satchmo” Armstrong

Returns To

By JOHN

Louis “Satchmo” Armstrong will
be back on the campus February
14 for a repeat performance
similar to last year’s concert. All
seats for the program are reserved.
Between January 19 and February
5, students may get their tickets
from any Inter-Fraternity Council
member for the special price of

$1.75. After February 5, the|}, 3

tickets will go up to $2.00.

Arnistrong got his start in music
while he was at the “Colored
Waif’s Home for Boys” where he
went when he was twelve years
old. He first tried the bugle, and
then the cornet. In jazzy New Or-
leans, where the “king” got his
start, he was a natural from the
beginning. His clear, true, and
clean nétes got him his first musi-
cal job. One night when Bunk
Johnson didn’t turn up at Mat-
ranga’s joint on Perdido Street,
Louis sat in for him (for $1.25 a
night).

When the war came in 1917,
the city of New Orleans, (at the
Navy's request) clamped down on
the honky-tonks, night clubs, bars,
and other places in the disease-
ridden “District.” This clamping
down brought about the mass
exodus of hundreds of jazz musi-
clans and caused the closing of
famous establishments like Lulu
White’s renowned Mahogany Hall.
(One of Louis’ prized recordings is
“Mahogany Hall Stomp.”)

Louis Armstrong was one of
hose who chose to stay in New
Yeleans, and it wasn’t long until
he was known as the finest cornet

first time since 1939, and were re-
ceived with high acclaim in Eng-
land, France, Holland, and Switzer-
land.

South America heard the Buda-
pest String Quartet in 1951, and
an overwhelming success was the
1952 performance series in Japan.
Indonesia, North Africa, Australia
and New Zealand audiences have
received the group with en-
thusiasm. “Perfect unanimity and
understanding of tonal and inter-
pretative effects,” wrote one critic.

It may come as a surprise to
some to learn of the high place
which the Quartet occupies on the
annual record-sale lists throughout
the nation. The recorded perfor-
mances of the Budapest four on
Victor and Columbia have been
selling about 300,000 copies per
annum, and some of the Beethoven
works have been described in the
New York Times as the “outstand-
ing of all records this season.” In
1946 the Budapest Quartet won
the only honor in chamber music
given by The Annual Recorded
Music Awards.

Most people take it for granted
that the Budapest String Quartet
is composed of Hungarian
musicians, but at present all are
Russian by birth and are American
citizens. -However, the historic
name was justified and the quartet
originally started with complete
Hungarian membership.

R.O.1.C. Depariment
Reveals Awards Plan

The ROTC Department this week
revealed a plan designed to in-
crease incentive in drill and to
add to general excellence of per-
sonal preparation.

Effective January 11 and ex-
tending until the May Awards Day,
outstanding cadets and units will
be selected each drill period. This
competition will constitute one of
the factors in selection of the win-
({ners of annual awards.

On the unit level, there will be
a selection of the Best Company
and Best Platoon of the Month by
the Cadet Regimental Commander
and his staff. The selection is based
on performance in drill as a unit,
personal appearance, percentage
of attendance, conduct of training,
and cadet. response. Both units
will receive streamers indicating |
their excellence.

Each company will choose one
outstanding cadet from each of the
MS I, Ij, and DI classes during the
first hour of drill.

In the second hour of drill, the
Cadet Regimental Staff will ob-
serve the above cadets and choose
the outstanding MS I, II, and II
cadet in the regiment. Personal ap-
Pearance, performance in drill,
and military knowledge are the
determinants of this award. Five
merits will be awarded the honored
cadets.

Special competition each month
among the Cadets of the Week
will be based on drill, appearance,
and military knowledge, with the
winner receiving five additional
merits.

Friday night, February 4 at 8:15,
the Budapet String Quartet will be
heard at Davidson in conjunction
with the Artist Series. Since its
American debut at Cornell Univer.
sity in 1930, this group has become
perhaps the finest exponent of
string quartet music in the world
today.

The history of quartet playing,
which is considered to be the
highest and purest form of music,
dates back to the 18th Century
when Hungary’s Prince Esterhazy
commissioned “Papa” Haydn to
write and play quartets for him.
Modern quartet playing had its
beginning in 1902 with Edward J.
de Coppet, a Manhattan broker,
who provided a practice retreat for
four players at his Swiss “Villa
Flonzaley.” Thus the first strictly
professional quartet ensemble was
born.

Now under a long-term contract
to the Whittall Foundation, The
Budapest String Quartet first
played in the Library of Congress
in 1938 and every year they aver-
age twenty-four concerts in the
Coolidge Auditorium, performing
on the magnificent Stradivari in-
struments there. This connection
with the Library also affords the
group opportunities for studying
the incomparable collection of
manuscript and recorded music.

The Quartet’s annual schedule
now consists of over a hundred
concerts, and their recent tours
have virtually covered the four
corners of the globe. In 1950 the
musicians toured Europe for the

the Mississippi River excursion
boats Dixie Bell and Sidney. In
1922, Joe Oliver sent for him and
Louis went north—in a land just
getting used to flappers, coon skin
coats, bathtub gin, and jazz itself.

From his modest beginning,
Armstrong organized his own band,
and he himself changed from the
cornet to the trumpet. From then
until now, Louis has been going
strong. When asked how long he
thinks he can last, the “jazz king”
replied, “right until I get to the
Pearly Gates, I hope,” When he
gets to those gates he is going to
pay his respects, he says, to
another famous trumpet player.
Says Louis: ‘Tm gonna blow a
kiss to Gabriel.”

Ten Davidson Men |Prof. Erwin Passes
Affend National Meet|At Home Dec. 30

The National Assembly of the
Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. was held
December 27 to January 2 at the
University of Kansas. A large Da-
vidson delegation, together with
thirty delegates from ten colleges
throughout the Carolinas, left the
Davidson campus by chartered bus
on December 26 to attend the As-
sembly. Representing the Davidson
“y,” headed by Sam Magill, were
John Baker, Jim Brice, Roy Davis,
Tony Dick, Henry Griffin, Charles
McGowan, John McVay, Bob Mack,
and Creighton Peden.

The theme of the Assembly was
the question, asked of Adam by
God, “Where Are You?” During
the week-long meeting, the dele-
gates sought, through worship and
study together, better to under-
stand the question and the Chris-
tian’s response to it. :

For study purposes, the Assem-
bly was broken into four sections
dealing with the individuals search
for a better understanding of him-
self, his relation to the university,
the nation and world, and the
struggle for freedom. These sec-
tions were further divided into
small discussion groups of from
ten to fifteen students each. The
discussions were based on five
work-books, especially prepared
for the Assembly by the National
Student Council of the YMCA and
YWCA.

The National Assembly is the
legislative body of the movement.
Meeting every four years, it de-
termines the policies and program
of the movement during the en-
suing four-year period.

For this reason, the Platform for
Effective Citizenship, prepared
by the Assembly, is important in
guiding the social action to be
taken by the movement. In the
Platform, statements of the As-
sembly’s position on various is-
sues, and recommendations for
further study, are made as a guide
for the local Christian Associa-
tions.

Each day’s activities opened
with a worship service, followed
by a Bible Presentation. Then,
until four o’clock, with a break for
lunch, the delegates met in plenary
sessions, sections, or work groups,
or in separate YMCA and YWCA
meetings. During the afternoon
free time, and at night after the
evening sessions, the delegates got
to know each other and exchange
ideas and opinions with fellow dele-
gates from all over the country.

In the course of the week vari-
ous phases of the “Y” movement
and related organizations were pre-
sented. One evening was devoted
to the World’s Student Christian
Federation. The Assembly became
acquainted with the work of the
World University Service, the Stu-
dent Volunteer Movement, and
World Service.

The Assembly closed on a note
of Christian unity with a com-

Professor Edward Jones Erwin,
68, died at his home in Davidson
at 3:30 a.m., December 30, 1954.
His death was unexpected and was
the result of a heart attack.

Professor Erwin was born in
Morganton, N.C., October 10, 1886,
son of the late George Phifer and
Corinna Avery Erwin. He was a
professor of English at Davidson
College, coming to Davidson in
1920. He received his A.B. degree
from Davidson in 1906, and his
M.A. degree from Columbia Uni-
versity in New York. He also
studied at the University of Chi-
cago. He taught high school in
New York City, the McCallie
School in Tennessee and the Uni-
versity of Mississippi before com-
ing to Davidson.

Mr. Erwin was a member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Omicron Delta
Kappa, Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma
Upsilon fraternities, a member and
founder of the Red and Black Mas-
quers, dramatic club at Davidson
College. He was a member and
teacher of the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church Men's Bible
Class, and an elder in his church.
He was a member of the Davidson
Lions Club and Mecklenburg
Lodge No. 176 of the Masonic
Order. He founded the Erwin
Lodge Recreation Center in David-
son in memory of his two sons
who lost their lives in World War
11.

Mr. Erwin is survived by his
wife, Mrs. Mary Browne Erwin;
one daughter, Mrs. R. C. Dyer of
Western Springs, Ill.; two grand-
children, Robin and Erwin Dyer;

Eumanean Society
Will Hear Davidson

On Monday, January 17, at 8:15
p.m., Eumanean Literary Society
will hold its regular meeting with
Dr. Chalmers Davidson of the
faculty as its guest.

Dr. Davidson will present to the
society readings from the novel
that he is in the process of writing.
The novel concerns the life of Da-
vidson undergraduates from the
founding years of the college to
the present.

Although it is to be fiction, it
is based on old letters, etc., writ-
ten by Davidson undergraduates.
Dr. Davidson calls it an attempt
to reveal historical facts about the
undergraduate life here in such a
way as to attract readers, which is
to say, perhaps, that a formal his-
tory of the college will attract few
readers,

The book to be written in five
sections, should take another four
or five years to complete as Dr.
Davidson has time for writing only
during the summer vacations. The
selections to be read are from the
first section and concern under-
graduate life in the 1830's. It con-
sists of letters, supposedly written
by a student:to his parents and
his girl, or girls, back home.

Have times changed too much?
As I read one of the letters which
concerned the usual routine on
the Sabbath, I realized that we as
students at the Davidson of today,
have very little cause to moan
about compulsory Vespers. In the
1830's, the students spent, for in-
stance, all Sunday afternoon read-
ing from the Bible and listening to
a sermon delivered by one of the
professors. ,

In those days, studying on the
Sabbath was practically a cardinal
sin and simply wasn't done. One
kept ‘the Sabbath and made no
bones about it.

It is in an attempt to draw
criticism from the members of Eu
that Dr. Davidson is reading selec-
tions from his newest endeavor,
which he intends to entitle
“Alenda Lux.” He contends that
such criticism will help him as he
works further on the novel.

This presentation, with the
critical discussion, should not take
much more than an hour and all
members of Eu are urged to at-
tend.

Dorothy Kae To Be
Featured Vocalist

By BILL GALLUIER

“It’s magic, it’s mellow, it's
Morrow” — so states the
announcement made by the
Interfraternity Council, which
has selected Buddy Morrow
and his orchestra to play for
the Davidson Midwinters
Dances, February 18 and 19.

The schedule of Morrow per-
formances includes a formal dance
Friday night. February 18, from
9 until 1, a concert Saturday after-
noon, and an informal affair Sat-
urday evening, 8 ‘til 12.

Audiences of dancers and critics
have all acclaimed the rhythm
style featured by the Morrow band,
and disk jockeys hail his record-
ings among the best in the in-
strumental field.

His performances at the Holly-
wood Palladium and ‘Atlantic City’s
Steel Pier have made his one of
the nation’s top ranking bands in
just three years since its incep-
tion, The group was voted the
most promising band in 1951 by
over 2000 dise jockeys polled by
Billboard magazine; it has fulfilled
this promise.

Morrow has set attendance
records at leading clubs and hotels,
including the Edgewater Park in
Detroit in 1952. His experience at
seven Ivy League and Big Ten
schools within the past year at-
tests to his popularity in collegiate
circles. °

In the Morrow entourage is
Dorothy Kae, an alluring blonde,
who reputedly employs the utmost’
in musical and corporal talent
while singing with the orchestra.

With eyes on Miss Kae, we may
take note, however, of the $10,000
insurance policy held on the cus-
tom-made trombone of leader Mor-
row.

Morrow first played profes-
sionally during his early teens in
his hometown of New Haven, Con-
necticut. He continued his musical
education at the Julliard Schoo!
of Music in New York where Paul
Whiteman took notice of him and
inked him into his orchestral ag.
gregation.

Now, at 35, bandman Morrow
can look back on a career of ex-
perience with Eddie Duchin, Artie
Shaw, Vincent Lopez, Temmy Dor.
sey and Jimmy Dorsey. He has
been under contract with the Co-
lumbia Broadcasting System, RCA
Victor Records, and Mercury Re-
cording Company. Uncle Sam’s
Navy also enjoyed the music of
Morrow's trombone during a three-
year stint, 1943 through 1946.

In 1950 “Rio Rita,” his first disc
for RCA, made a hit in the record-
ing world. This was followed by
such top waxings as “Night Train,”
“Greyhound,” “One Mint Julep,”
“Rose, Rose, I Love You,” and
“That Old Black Magic.” Morrow,
whose talents are not confined to
band directing, has also composed
a number of pop tunes, of which
the best known is his “Boogie
Woogie March.”

Mr. Morrow's succession of hit
recordings and club dates places
his orchestral reputation among
the highest in the nation.
