Live album

The psychedelic spiral of
lights flickers ahead, just be-
yond the giant floating hot dog.
Mounted on top of the mustard
and relish, the four members of
Phish drift by, touting an im-
promptu version of “Tweezer,”
as the vacuum cleaner hums in
the background.

Unfortunately, you might
have missed this live event, but
you can experienceA Live One,
Phish’s new double CD album
that features both extended ver-
sions of previously recorded
songs as well as new, unreleased
tracks,

This compilation of Phish’s
brilliant yet somewhat twisted
songs from the albumsJunta, A.
Picture of Nectar, and Lawn
Boy easily reflects the band’s
true genius and capacity.

Original and unrevised, this
album is the best live perfor-
mance youcan buy thatis cheap.

The album kicks off with
an energetic rendition of
“Bouncing Around the Room,”

GOD STREET WINE

SOUNDS LES

By Mary Tow es ALLISON

Thursday night started out
rather slowly for God Street Wine.
Looking like any other alternative
band spawned from the 90s, they
came decked out in their. finest
grungewear, and their scrubby look
fit the stereotypical “rocker” ap-
pearance. Students arrived in small
groups, gradually gathering at
Richardson Field to hear the much-
talked-about band. Handfuls of
students lingered in the back of the
field while others took their places
front and center. The crowd slowly
grew, and the social atmosphere
heightened. The band warmed up,
and the show began.

While the band’s mellow tone
seemed to reflect the crowd’s gen-
eral mood, the show lacked en-
ergy. If they had had more variety
in their songs, they would have
received a more energetic reaction
from the crowd. Although there
were some people dancing and re-
ally enjoying the show, it seemed
as though God Street Wine served
as background music for a casual
social event.

God Street Wine lacked origi-
nality. Ithada pretty generic, low-
key, rock sound. The music wasn’t
incredibly moving, and there was
little diversity in the songs they

played.

However, the group hada great
blend and an even better sound on
the solos. God Street Wine is made
up of five very talented musicians.
The group showcased their solo-
ing ability, which underplayed the
mediocrity of the music selection.

Overall, I'd give the band a
rating of B+. The band’s musical
quality was appealing to people

who like all sorts of music. God
Street Wine’s sound met extreme
tastes in the middle. Those who
generally like bluegrass or country
weren’t turned off by a hard-core

riff while those who are into alter- °

native and other forms of rock could
live with its contemporary focus.
It was nice to hear something that
was familiar and had a good beat,
but the night could have picked up
a little more if there had been more
diversity.

Students I talked to shared my
views. One wished the band had

could have moshed to while an-
other student had hoped to hear a
sound with a more energetic beat.
Everyone I talked with seemed to
like the band’s style. Some even
compared God Street Wine. to
Phish.

The event was a needed study
break for all. After a long week of
new classes and professors plus
the other adjustments that come
with anew school year, the relaxed
mood that the band provided was
much appreciated.
