Cross Country
teams ready
themselves for
fall seasons

By Jean DeMoss
& Matthew Bradley
Women's Team

Three teams showed up for
the first women’s cross-country
meet of-the year at Moses H. Cone
State Park near Boone. The Lady
Wildcats finished third behind Ap-
palachian State and UNC-Char-
lotte.

A hard rain fell hours before
the race which left the course
muddy. When the gun went off at
four, however, the running condi-
tions were perfect. Davidson’s top
seven finished less than a minute
apart. Strong performances were
turned in by Carolyn Meadows,
Katie McKelvie, Stephanie Moses,
and Erin Roach. The strategy of
pack running will definitely psyche
out a lot of teams in future meets.

Besides battling the other

teams, the runners had to share the |

course with horses. Runners even
had to avoid horse chips.

The women’s cross-country
team was picked to finish a disap-
pointing seventh out of eightteams
in the Southern Conference. After
the opening meet, however, the
team looks only toimprove. When
the Southern Conference meet rolls
around, the the women’s cross
country team will surprise a lot of

people.
Men's Team

Davidson’s men’s cross-coun-'

try team has a lot of new faces this
year, with junior Eric McMichael
being the only non-freshman. The
team opened upits season this past
Saturday with a three team meet at
Boone’s Moses Cone Memorial
Park.

The early, rainy weather
cleared and left cool conditions.
After the obligatory sprint start,
the runners circled Bass Lake for
the race’s first mile. They then
followed a horse trail into the trees
for the race’s second, third, and
fourth miles. The horses had left a
muddy path and other, less. aes-
thetic surprises. Nevertheless, the
three mile section was equally di-
vided between a long gradual up-
hill, a flat portion with lots of turns,
and a downhill with more
switchbacks. The runners then
emerged back into the daylight for
one more lap around the lake and
the finish.

When all was said and done,
Mike Coyle was Davidson’s top
finisher. His time of 28:08 made
him the tenth fastest Wildcat ever
torun the course. Eric McMichael,
Mathew Bradley, and Chris
Machon followed within twenty
seconds, and Dave Foss rounded
out the scoring five in 29:04. -

The host team from Appala-
chian St. won the meet with 15
points, followed by UNC-Char-
lotte with 46, and the Wildcats
ended up with 82. Davidson will
travel to Winston-Salem on Sep-
tember 18 for an invitational meet

Football looking to improve under new leaders.

The Davidson football team
enters this year’s fall campaign
with anew headcoach, Tim Landis.
Coach Landis replaces Dave Fagg
who presided over the team the
previous three seasons. Fagg be-
came Executive Director of the
Wildcat Club and Assistant Ath-
letic Director. Landis had been an
assistant to Fagg for the past two
seasons.

At 29, Landis is one of the
youngest head coachesin America.
He feels ecstatic about his new
position. “This is a dream come
true,” Landis said. “It has hap-
pened sooner in my career than I
imagined. Iattendedacollege simi-

Men's soccer remains
optimistic despite losses

By Will Cobb
The Davidson College soccer
team suffered a 4-0 loss to the

eleventh ranked James Madisonin

its season opener last Saturday in
the first round of the Wake Forest
Invitational. The Cats play in the
second round against Syracuse
University.

After coming off a season
decorated with two tournamentvic-
tories, a Southern Conference title,
and an‘ appearance in the Final
Four, the team anticipates a season
that will help establish a consis-
tently successful program.

While losing nine players to
graduation, Davidson hopes to en-
joy success while rebiulding. This
year’s squad will be young, since

Men send the Orangemen packing

The men's team defeated Syracuse University on Monday in
their second game at the Wake Forest Invitational. Led by Ben
Hayesand Reid Maltbie, the Cats jumped ahead by two goals in the
first half. At the beginning of the second half, Syracuse managed
to put one in the back of the net. That was all, however, for the
Orangemen, and Davidson added 2 more to finish ahead 4-1. Their
next game is 5:00 Wednsday at the university of South Carolina.

The Davidson football play-
ers are also very excited about
Landis. Senior Rob King stated
that, “everyone on the team has a
positive attitude this year. The play-
ers are so exited this year and the
coaches relate so well to the play-
ers.”

1993 OUTLOOK

With a new head coach and
many returning players, Davidson ;
hopes to improve on their 5-5
record of a year ago. This year, the
Wildcats will switch from Divi-
sion III in football to Division I-
AA. However, most of Davidson’s
opponents this year will be of Di-
vision III stature, because of geo-
graphical reasons.

While Davidson hopes to im-
prove on last year’s five hundred
season, they will face some very
stiff competition early. Davidson’s
first three opponents (The Univer-
sity of the South, Rhodes, Emory
and Henry) were acombined 24-6-
1 last year.

The Cats open the season at
the University of the South on Sep-
tember 11, and return home the
next week for Rhodes. On the third
week of the season they travel to
Emory and Henry, who were 10-0
last year and made the Division III
semi-finals.

The senior class of Davidson
is the first one with noscholarship
players. Luckily for Davidson,
however, is that there are 22 re-
turning starters in this year’s lineup.
Amongst those starters are the
team’s two senior captains: Rich-
ard Howell and Alden Smith.

Howell, the quarterback, en-
ters his final season at Davidson
after leading the team last year in
passing (1198 yards 10 touch-
downs) and rushing (383 yards 4
touchdowns). Smith, who plays
cornerback, contributed 55 tackles
last year and led the defense with
seven interceptions. Smith also
returned 28 kickoffs for 573 yards
and 24 punts for 155 yards. It
seems, however, that football is
not enough for Smith who also
serves as the President of
Davidson’s Student Government
Association.

On the offensive side of the
ball, Davidson will be especially
strong up front. Although they lost
standout Nathan Fenwick at cen-
ter, senior Rob King will move
over and take his spot. Another
senior, Jack Barry, will man a spot
on the line and he has started all 28
games since his freshman year.
Seniors Chris Edmonston and
Charles “Chopper” Hill will also

The possibility of an all senior
Starting offensive line will be put
on hold for a couple of weeks due
to a knee injury that will keep
Barrett Plasman out of action.
Freshman John Cowan has im-
pressed the coaching staffthis sum-
mer and he will start in place of
Plasman.

Davidson also looks strong at
the skilled positions this coming
season. While Davidson will miss
