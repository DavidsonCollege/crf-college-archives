Around the horn

No-wm situation in Division I

By HAP BRYANT
“To strive with an equal is a
doubtful’ thing to do; with a
superior, a mad thing; with an in-
ferior, a vulgar thing.” Thus wrote
the latin moralist Seneca in the
first century, C.E. Having rumi-
nated upon this bit of wisdom, |
think it applies to Davidson's
membership in the Colonial
League. If Seneca were around
today, doubtless he would say that
we are mad.
First, we must mention those
‘who struggle against overwhelm-
ing odds; namely, the football
team. They work endlessly to
hone their skills and reach their
potential. I have observed their
dedication in the weight room
since last January; they astound
me with their perserverance,
strength, and their desire to suc-
ceed. Surely they must expect
some reward. Thus far, they have
received none.
The coaches put in long hours
as well. They try their hardest to
prepare their team for the upcom-

ing week. They too have worked__is also a member of the Colonial._

since January, or really since the
end of the last campaign, in re-
cruitifig, conditioning, and strate-
gy sessions. Their reward thus far
has been disappointing. They de-
vise plays that would work if the
competition were equal. How-
ever, the basic tenet of football re-
mains true; if you can’t knock the
other guy down, he’s going to beat
you. Through no fault of the
coaches or players, the Wildcats
just haven’t been able to knock
anybody down for 60 minutes on
Saturday.

Why? Harry Truman said, “If
you can’t stand the heat, get out of
the kitchen.” Simply put, David-
son football is trying to cook in too
fancy a kitchen. We're not the

ata’ tea

gourmet chefs of this athletic
kitchen. We’ve been pretending
that we aré for too long. We could
hold our own in Ham and Eggs,
but not in Mama Leone’s. That’s
what Division I football has be-
come — too much for Davidson
to handle. We don’t have to quit
cooking entirely, we just have to
do it in a more appropriate
kitchen.

Case in point: Holy Cross is a
member of the Colonial League.
So are Lehigh and Davidson.
Mind you, Holy Cross and Lehigh
are pretty low as far as Division I
teams go. Lehigh beat Davidson
47-0 several weeks back. Last
weekend, Holy Cross beat Lehigh
63-6. What do you think would
happen if Davidson played Holy
Cross? If Lehigh is 47 points bet-
ter than Davidson, and Holy Cross
is 57 points better than Lehigh,

then Holy Cross would be about .

104 points better than Davidson.

Of course, this isn’t necessarily

true. But you see my point.
Another case in point: Colgate

League. Along with Holy Cross,
Colgate has what they think is a
legitimate Heisman Trophy candi-
date in Kenny Gamble. Holy
Cross has Gordie Lockbaum.
Davidson has no football player
on an athletic scholarship, only on
need-based financial aid..Do you
think that Gamble and Lockbaum
should be in the same league as
non-scholarship players? Don’t
kid yourself.

Finally, let’s look at some of
the stats from last week’s game. In
casé you forgot, we played
Princeton,.a second division Ivy
League football program. They
are probably one notch above Col-
‘umbia, which has lost 33 games in
a row. Davidson rushed 40 times

_ stand

Freshman Bryn Robinson rockets forward

for 37 yards. Princeton rushed ‘52
times for 316 yards. That’s 279
yards more than Davidson on
twelve more tries. They passed for
208 yards, and we passed for 142
yards. However, this is even de-
ceiving. Reserve quarterback
Mark Skoczynski passed for 106
of the 142 yards, most of them
after Princeton’s regulars had hit
the showers. As any sensible per-
son could see, there is quite a dis-
crepancy here. And in the restau-
rant business we call Division I
‘football, Princeton is like
Wendy’s 23.

As is evident from recent
games, Davidson is overmatched
in Division I, even in the Colonial
League. Why must the coaches
and players undergo such misery?
Two answers: the Trustees and the
athletic administration. They
seem to think we can still com-
pete. How wrong they are. With-
out athletic scholarships today,
Division. I competition will crush
a small school like Davidson. Is it
a coincidence that Davidson’s last_|_
win on the gridiron came against
Wofford College, then an NAIA
school, now applying for Division
III membership? When we play
Wingate for homecoming this
year, everyone will see that we
can compete against division III
schools.

As much as I like the sound of
Division I membership, it is not
realistic given our present cir-
cumstances. And like the Ro-
mans, who would not listen to.
Seneca, our Trustees and adminis-
tration will not listen when stoics
call for a sensible schedule policy,
in concert with our means. Then
maybe we will at least stirve
“doubtfully” instead of “madly ,”
as we are doing now.

Field hockey improves

By LARRY DAGENHART,
JRE

The Davidson field hockey
team’s woes continued Tuesday
with a 2-0 loss to Appalachian
State University. Although the
game was the Wildcats’ fourth

shutout in a row, they played a lot |

better overall. “It looked -like a
different game,” said coach Betsy
Pryor. “We passed well and kept
up our offensive pressure.”

The Mountaineers struck in
the first half on a goal that could
have been called back for a

| dangerous play. Unfortunately,

there was no penalty and the score
stood at 1-0. The ’Cats continued
to hang tough through the first
half

Mid-way into the second half,

Davidson began showing some
strong offense, something it has
lacked in its previous losses. The
Cats had the ball on Appalac-
hian’s goal line but somehow
couldn't score. A few possessions
later, freshman Gigi Cooke nearly
tied the score ona beautiful

The shot missed the left comer of |}
the goal by a few inches. The
crowd of students and parents

around at different positions, “we
now have the right lineup,” she
said.

Gigi Cooke also commented
on the game: “It was the first time
we pulled together as a team and
we were much more aggressive.”

The aggressiveness showed.

get ten shots on the goal, the
Wildcats got 14, their record for
the season.

It was another Davidson
moral victory, and things are
looking brighter for. the field hoc-
key team.

The Wildcats go into in action

Pfeiffer College. Their next home
game will be on Wednesday, Oc-
tober 14, against Salem College. | —

‘Volleyball loses tri-match.
The Wildcat volleyball team
dropped two/matches on Wednes-
day night, and their record fell to
0-8 on the season. In the first
match, Davidson lost to Furman
three games to one. Then, the
*Cats dropped a 3-0 decision to
Gardner-Webb College. On
Thursday, the team played UT-
Chattanooga.

-Golf team fares well i in D.C.
The Davidson golf team, playing
its fall match schedule, placed
fourth of sixteen teams in the Geo-
rgetown “Let’s Go” Hoya Invita-
tional last weekend. Sophomore
Gates Grainger turned in an excel-
lent performance, leading the
field with a first-round 75, then
faltering somewhat with an 80 in
the second round. Overall, the
team looks good, and we expect
success in the spring.

-Trivia question. What pitcher
holds the distinction of having lost
3 of the 4 world series games? An-
swer to last week’s question: Rube

Marquard won 19 consecutive
games for the 1918-1919 New
York Giants, the longest pitching
win streak on record. |

‘Take a hike. (1) The NFL
striking players, particularly Tony
Dorsett, who have shown their
true class by throwing eggs at re-
placement players, fighting sc-
outs, and wielding unloaded shot-
guns around the camps. (2) Davey
Johnson, the New York Mets
manager, who is demanding con-
tract renegotiation in the midst of
@ pennant race. (3) Columnists
who do not deliver (you know
who you are) (4) John Barrow,
