gregation fram Charlotte High. Friday

the Dramatic and Glee Clubs, in a joint
performance at Shearer Hall. Friday
night has been selected by the committee
as Formal Night, and all students, whose
wardrobes permit, will appear in formal
attire.

The Speaking celebration will reach its
zenith on Saturday, when a full day of

interesting events will be offered for the
amusement of the guests on the hill. The!
first of these events is a track meet in!
the morning. This will be followed in!
the afternoon by an interesting game of
baseball, which will bring the Davidson
freshmen into action against the Gas-
tonia High School team. Saturday night
will bring the biggest event of the whole
affair, and it is at this time that the
Junior Class will stage an extravagantly-
arranged “Roman Circus” in the gym-

nasium. The circus Promises to even

Wildcat Debaters
Meet Emory And
Trinity Speakers

Davidson's forensic stars are primed
for their encounter with Emory Univer-
sity’s debating team at Queens College,
Friday evening at 8 p.m. For several
weeks the Davidson and Emory debaters
have been hard at work, and the coming
debate promises to be exceptionally
close and exciting.

The team that is to be pitted against
the Emory debaters is composed of L.
D. Elkins, W. M. Cox, and P. J. Story.
Elkins and Cox are debaters of expe-
rience, both of them having been mem-
bers of the team that defeated Trinity
last year; while Story is a newcomer of
much ability in the art. :

Emory’s team, according to reports
from the Atlanta institution, represent
the best that the university has; and
fully capable of acquitting them-
selves in fine style. A large crowd of
Davidson students are expected to at-
tend the contest, which is to be the first
between the two schools,

Three days after this debate, a sep-
arate team composed of D. B. Wharton,
L. C. Little, and D. B. Walthall will meet
Trinity and argue the same question.
Wharton and Walthall both served as

The Y. M. C. A. vesper service last
Sunday was conducted by Warren M.

Misses Caroline Rogers and Alice Gibbon
of Queens College. Mr. Williams, sec-

ers.

Warren Cox, the first speaker, took as
his subject “Truth.” He opened with a
quotation of Demosthenes, “What we
have in us of the image of God is the
love of truth and justice.” “There are
two opposing forces,” said the speaker,
“error and truth. All extremes in any
direction «nay be classed as error and
our task is to find the broad middle path-
way of truth. The three greatest things
in life are love, service and truth, and
truth is the foundation of the other two.”

Cox then pointed out the two classes

Fraternity Houses Scene of Youth-
ful Gaiety and Frolic—Event to
be Permanent

Despite the inclemency of the weather,
the Non-Fraternity Week End of April
sth and 6th, proved a success from every
standpoint. Many girls were on the hill
both Saturday and Sunday to enliven the
campus with their presence, and several
entertainments were put on for their
especial benefit and pleasure.

This af-
fair was the first of its kind at Davidson
for some years, the plan having been dis-
carded back in to17 or earlier,

To Doctor Arbuckle goes eredit for re-
viving this delightful custom of social
meetings by both fraternity and—nen-
fraternity men, With the assistance of
the Pan-Hellenie Council he made plans
for re-establishing this custom which has
been the source of much enjoyment in
the past. From all indications, it will be
a permanent fixture the Davidson
program for years to come.

An out-of-doors festival had been plan-
ned for Saturday evening but the con-
finued rain made it impossible to spread

trees the catnpus. The Japanese
lanterns were transferred to the gym-
nasium and a long. table placed in -the
central portion, Such an array of things
to eat has seldom been seen at David-
con, and after the inroads of the girlies
and their escorts, more than 12 baskets of
fragments were left... Nothing remained
except to send out a call for the Fresh-

order,

A. M. Hillhouse and J. M. Hendrix are
an attendance on the third annual con-
vention of the Southern Federation of
College Students now being held at the
University of North Carolina. These
delegates were selected by the student
council to serve as Davidson's first dele-
gates to this convention,

The federation, organized at Georgia
Tech in 1922, has for its purpose the de-
velopment of college spirit, athletics, pub-
lications and the creation of a closer fel-
lowship among the southern colleges.

This is Davidson's first year as a mem-
ber of the federation, Her delegates will
raise the question of paying college
athletes. Davidson’s opinion on the mat-
ter is widely known and will be strongly
voiced by her representatives at the con-
vention. Since this phase of athletics
concerns almost every southern college,
the discussion of the question of re-
muneration for athletic work will doubt-
less effect a beneficial development in
college athletics.

The Southern Federation of College
Students, when but two years old, was
composed of sixteen of the leading south-
ern colleges. It has grown considerably

j during the past year and. hopes to in-
‘clude all of the leading educational in-

stitutions in the south within the next
few years. The present session of the
convention has a‘full attendance.
