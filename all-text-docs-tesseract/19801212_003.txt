Boyce & Teague, Holt &
Wall run for advisorships

By ANNE GOODWIN
Staff Writer.

Two teams of hall counselors
are running for freshman advi-
sors. Margaret Holt and Jeff
Wall oppose Barbara Boyce and
John Teague.

The freshman advisors’ re-
sponsibilities include organizing
the selection and training of
next year’s hall counselors and
advising them throughout the
year. The advisors also act as a
link between the Dean of Stud-
ents’ office and the counselors.

The advisors must be a team
of. two former hall counselors,
one female and one male. ,

Holt is hall counselor on
second Richardson and is a
member of Rusk House. Wall is
hall counselor on first Belk
Center East and is a KA.

According to Holt and Wall,
freshman advisors should be
careful to present candidates for
hall counselor with a realistic
picture of the responsibilities of
the job so as to prevent feelings
of disillusionment. The advisors
should also give an objective
account of Davidson to incom-
ing freshmen.

Holt added that they would

Snead to edit
Miscellany

By JOHN SIMAN
News Editor

Junior Parks Snead decided
to become Miscellany editor
after a spur of the moment
conversation Wednesday night
with the literary magazine’s
advisor, German Professor Ju-
lius Winkler.

Snead, an English major who
likes to write fiction, said he did
not sign up for the editorship
because he was not fully sure
what the job entailed. However,
when Winkler told him no one
was running, Snead accepted

_the editorship without hesita-
tion.

Snead now edits fiction sub-
mitted to the Miscellany.

Snead described the basic
operation of the Miscellany as
“cut and dried.” Writers from
all.over the country mail works
of poetry and fiction to the
magazine. ‘‘We get so much
stuff, it’s unbelievable,’’ Snead
said.

The student staff members —
who number about eight or
ten—read through the submis-
sions and pass the better ones
along to Winkler and the editor,
who make the final decision of
what to publish.

The whole process is done
informally, with no staff meet-

‘ ings, Snead said.

The Méiscellany’s contribu-
tors are scattered from ‘‘Califor-
nia to Charlotte,” and Snead
wants to make sure the maga-

- zine continues to represent a

diverse group of writers. For
example, he plans to ask friends
at other colleges to advertise
the Miscellany to their class-

Snead said the editor's role is

not to innovate: “The innova-
tions...are made by the people
who put stuff in it.”’

‘keep in touch with the hall

counselors throughout the year.
Boyce, who is also a member

‘of Rusk, is hall counselor on
first Richardson. Teague is hall

counselor on first Belk East and
eats at Fannie and Mabel’s.

Boyce and Teague emphasiz-

ed the freshman advisors’ role
as counselor to the hall counsel-
ors. Boyce sees the freshman
advisor as a ‘‘manager-type”’
who provides a link between
hall counselors and the Dean of
Students and cohesion among
the hall counselors.
' Teague said he would like to
see more students get involved
in helping the freshmen. He also
said he would work to make the
hall counselors a more unified
group so that they could advise
each other.

Both Holt and Wall said the
freshman hall experience is
important as an introduction to
Davidson. Wall said that al-
though Davidson is not perfect,
it ‘‘has much to offer.’’ He
would like to be able to present
this view to next year’s fresh-
men.

Both Holt and Wall mention-
ed previous experiences in coun-
seling which they felt would
make them good advisors. Wall
said he has worked for two
summers as a Presbyterian
youth minister, while Holt has
led a Girl Scout troop in
Davidson for the past two
years.

Boyce and Teague said that
they have diverse interests and
personalities that complement
each other. Boyce cited their
working together as resident
advisors.as proof of their con-
geniality. Boyce said she has
enjoyed being a hall counselor
and helping people learn about
Davidson, while Teague said he
would like to use his ‘“know-
ledge acquired at Davidson to
help freshmen get a better
start.’

Handbook

candidates
stress their
experience

By TIM WHALEN
Staff Writer

Two teams of juniors are
running for Wildcat Handbook
editor this year. Candidates
Steve Carter and Patti Long are
opposing Donna Iles and Bar-
bara Kelley.

All of the candidates said
they have a special interest in
freshmen. Iles and Kelley point-
ed out that the Handbook is
very important because it is
“one of the first impressions”
freshmen receive of the College.

Carter and Long said that
their publishing and personal
experience are their strongest
assets. Long was features editor
of last year’s Handbook and
Carter edited and sold adver-
tisements for the ‘‘SAE Charity
Calendar.‘‘ Both are hall coun-
selors and “know what kinds of
questions freshmen ask,” they
said.

“We think it is really import-
ant that the people putting the

.Handbook together are active

on campus so that they know
the people to get in contact
with,’’ Carter and Long said.
They added that representing
both sexes would enable them
to produce a more balanced

Turnbull & McAlister vie for Y secretary

By FRANCES PALMER
Staff Writer

All Y Student Service Corps
positions, with the exception of
secretary, are uncontested this
year. ~

Sophomores Gordon Turnbull
and Kim McAlister are running
for secretary.

In his second year of mem-
bership in the Y, Turnbull chose

_to run because he views it as

the next step in increasing his

involvement with the service
club. According to Turnbull,
the Y is ‘‘one of the best
activities on campus,” and he
wants to help in its work in any
way possible. As he sees it, his
duties would involve not only
the regular secretarial jobs but
also close work with the other
officers to plan different activi-
ties.

McAlister, currently one of
the heads of the Senior Citizen
Program, sees the job as an

ricular vice-president, and
junior Jonathan West for social
vice-president.

As Union president, Parker
will conduct interviews for com-
mittee chairpersons, preside at
Union Board meeting, inform
committee chairpersons of up-
coming events and represent
the Union on certain campus
committees.

Parker plans no major chan-
ges for the Union under her
leadership. ‘‘I don’t think there
really need to be many chan-
ges,” Parker said. “I think the
way it has been run in the past
year has been really good.”’
However, Parker does plan to
solicit more student involve-
ment in the Union Programs.

Parker points to her past
involvement with the Union as

her qualifications for the office.

Parker served on two Union
committees her freshman year
and attended the National En-
tertainer and College Activities
Association convention her
sophomore year. She is current-

ly chairperson of the Campus
Forum committee.

Two to edit yearbook

By JOHN SIMAN
News Editor

Juniors Karen Welty and

Lori Boardman will be co-
editors of Quips and Cranks,
the College yearhook, next

year.

“I hadn’t really thought a-
bout doing it,’’ Welty, who now
does layout work for Quips and
Cranks, said: But when she
heard that no one had signed
up to run for the editorship,

‘she decided to make a commit-

ment.

‘Welty asked Boardman, a
friend of hers, ‘‘to share the
frustrations and work.’’ ‘‘We
have the same attitudes about |
what a yearbook is and what
it should be,’’ Welty said.

Welty was editor of her high
school yearbook three years in

a row. Boardman has no year-
book experience but said her
background in art will be appli-
cable to yearbook design.

Welty and Boardman both
expressed dissatisfaction with
past editions of Quips and
Cranks.

Welty thinks the book ought
to be unified around an artistic
theme, for past editions have

the quality of layout. ‘There's

a lot of wasted spece,”’ Welty
said.

Also, Welty plans innova-
tions for their own sake: “The

opportunity to become more
involved in the Y.

Although she has never been
a secretary, McAlister was an
officer in several of her high
school clubs. Aside from typ-
ing, filing, and sending out
letters, she said her position
would entail working with the
other officers to plan programs
and design policies. In this way
she hopes to continue the Y
programs because they “have
been so good this year.”

Junior John Spangler will be
the next Y president. Spangler
described the Y as a “‘liasion”
between the College and the

“The Y gives students a
chance to break away from the
me-ness of Davidson and to
