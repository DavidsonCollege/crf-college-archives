There When
It's N eeded :
Counselling

at Davidson

By Jo Burrows

There was once a time when a
narrow-minded attitude towards
psychotherapy and counselling ex-
isted. Seeking help was regarded
as an extreme measure, taken by
only the very desperate or weak.
Luckily, however, amore positive
attitude now prevails. People ac-
cept that dealing. directly with
problems is the best thing to do,
and that counselling can be of great
help.

Davidson offers a completely
confidential counselling service to
all enrolled students, who can re-
ceive up to ten counselling ses-
sions at no extra cost.

Neatly hidden in the basement
of the college Union, the Student
Counselling Center employs three

fully-trained counsellors: DeWitt

Crosby, Molly Terry, and David
Staton, the current director. Stu-
dents can arrange hourly appoint-
ments on weekdays between 8.30
and 5.00, but the counsellors re-
mien on Call 24 hours a'day for
emergencies.

The counsellors will discuss
many types of problems that
Davidson students can face. These
range from difficulties handling
workloads and stress, to problems
with depression and anxiety. Stu-
dents can also receive counselling
on drug and alcohol problems,
eating disorders, and family issues
such as divorce or death.

‘With a great deal of pressure
on students, the S.C.C. can be a
valuable source of help and reas-

surance. Although seeking coun-

selling may still seem a little dras-
tic, itis really a way of recognizing
that.a problem exists, and dealing
directly with it.

If youhave something that you
fee! you need help with, call 2451
fOr an appointment. After all, you
have nothing to lose.

Environmental Action Committee
Needs Your Help & Support

By Chris Moeling

Besides the academic education
Davidson offers its students, this
institution teaches us about living
productive, meaningfullives. With
its focus on service and humani-
tarianism, Davidson encourages
Students to develop lifestyles en-
riched with concern for fellow
humanity.

When it comes to environ-
mental issLzs; however, Davidson
fails to show students how to-be
conscientious conservationists.
Recently, the world has begun to
open its eyes to the problems it
faces, and has begun to live with
the planet’s welfare in mind.

Toencourage this trend locally,
it is essen... -allege and
the students take a more active,
concerned role in protecting and
maintaining ourcommunity. While
some problems have been evalu-
ated and alieviated, no one denies
that there is room for more im-
provements.

The campus community | is
pleased with the Ground Crew’s
new turkey manure fertilizer (de-
spite its smell). Irvin Brawley de-
serves a pat on the back for the
switch to environmentally non-

threatening fertilizing methods. .
“Such steps in this “environmen-

tally conscious” direction remain
few and far between at Davidson.
A large number of students admit
that their college is “behind the
times” with regard to recycling
and environmental action,

The administration’s apparent
apathy toward recycling concerns
many Davidson students. In the
past two years, recycling evolved
from being an easily fulfilled stu-
dentresponsibility toa job thatcan
only be accomplished by highly
motivated people with cars (to de-
liver their recyclable goods to the
shed).

Although the administration
has taken over the bulk of recy-
cling responsibilities, the recycling
efforthas suffered overall. Because
recycling centers are not located
on every floor, many students do
notbother to walk their recyclables
down to their lounges.

Additionally, because plastics
are no longer recycled in dormito-
ries, much potentially recyclable
material is trashed, Many students
are also unaware that Davidson
recycles office paper. (Next to the
TV lounge in the Union, students
can take plastic and office paper,
as well as all other recylables.)

One student complained that
on his freshman’ hall, they had to

The Legend of
Archibald Jones

This legend of Archibald Jones comes from the 1914 Quips and Cranks.

Please excuse the massive editing.

Archibald Jones

But to go back to the tale I am telling,
There came to College the Fall of one year
One man possessed of an aspect so dismal
All said he looked most exceedingly queer.

And when they asked him to tell what his name was,
He replied to them in sad, dismal tones, a
That the thing given to him at baptism,

Summed up in toto was Archibald Jones.

Having said this he shut up like a mousetrap,
Never again did he utter a se formed no friendships, nor did he wantany,

But solitarily tramped he around.

For many nights.it was thought that he studied

As he went straight to his room, locked his door,
Pulled up his transom, and locked both his windows,
And until morning w nevermore. | -

But soon ’twas noticed he knew not his lessons--

He seemed but waiting for class to get through,
Then when folks thought of these long nightly vigils,
They began wondering: “What can he do?”

There was a certain young student in College,
Just what his name was I can’t think today.
*Tis said he came here a seeker of knowledge,
But as to that--well, I really can’t say.

But he was filled with that curse, curiosity,
Other folks’ business he pondered much more
Than his own matters, and one day in passing,
Came to a halt before Archibald’s door.

collect their recyclable in their own
rooms, collect them from hallmates
on their own, and then load upacar
to transport the cans and bottles to
the shed.

The point is, people will not
recycle at all if it takes an entire
day to do it.

On another hall, the recyclable
collected in the bathroom higher
than the stall walls. Davidson stu-
dents want to be environmentally
aware, but without the administra-
tion’s help, recycling will continue
to lag.

Recycling is only one dilemma
of many thatare frustrating to those
who want to see a more “environ-
mentally correct” Davidson. Why
not deliver only one Davidsonian
to each room-- few people will
complain or even notice. Fresh-
men receive two flyers for each
party under their doors-- one for
each roommate. Why not put one
flyer up on the hall-- people will
still come.

Build kiosks or hundreds of
flyers will continue to litter our
campus. If you share these con-
cerns, or have others. . .

Cafe’s Tunes
Receive
Mixed
Reactions

By May Martin
and Leigh McKeever

Some love it, some hate it. But
Union Director William Brown
says that the Union Cafe’s new
jukebox is only anexperiment. It’s
there on a trial basis to see how
students react to it. If students put
money into it, Brown says chances
are it will stay, if not. . .

The six freshmen SGA sena-
tors came up with the idea of a
jukebox after they met to brain-
storm about their goals for the year.
B.J. Rudell came up with the idea
because he said that he saw it as a
way to bring more life into the
Union and make it a place where
students can hang out and can do
more than just eat.

Sophomore Al Gaines thinks
that the jukebox is a great idea, and
that he frequently feeds the juke-
box quarters. Mary Lee, who works
as acashier in the Union, says that

- Heed now my words, oh ye innocent Freshmen!

Think on them carefully when you’re alone.
He would have been safe, if ‘stead of attending
Other folks’ business, he’d minded his own.

But he did not, but with movements called catlike

Softly he knelt at the corridor floor.

Next he applied his left eye to the keyhole,
And then what do you suppose that he saw?

There at the table was Archibald seated,

Flushed was his cheeks, and his eyes flashed and rolled--
As he caressed it, and blessed it, and pressed it--

There on the table--a great heap of gold!

Gold! Countless thousands lay there on the table!
Gold! Yes, a fortune kings might not despise!
Gold! With its promise of pleasure and power!
Can we but wonder he felt some surprise?

Then la thunderbolt left he the keyhole!

~ Jumped to his feet, and with one mighty shove
Precipitated himself at the doorway,

And crashed right through the glass transom above!

Into the room like a wild streak of lightning

Came he headforemost. Grabbed Archi’s head,

Bit him and scratched him, and strangled and mauled him,
And in two minutes the miser was dead!

Threw he himself on that heap on the table,

Pressed and caressed it, but soon paused for fear.
Thinking that folks who should hear the proceedings
Might think the whole thing just a little bit queer.

Just then a most diabolical project .
To his cerebrum from hell did arise.

He thought of those hollow columns of Chambers
Which held the portico up to the skies.
