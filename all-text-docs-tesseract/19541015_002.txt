The Library: Alenda Lux

Words are seldom formed on the lips
of people in Davidson to compliment or
to criticize the Library. Somehow amidst
all the complaint and praise of recent
times the book building seems to have
escaped both the leveling of big artillery
and the bestowing of laurels.

It has quietly served its purpose here
as the intellectual center of the campus,
and with a hard-working and conscien-
tious staff has made vast improvements
of which many of us are not aware, or
of which those of us who are aware say
little.

Nothing has attracted more notice than
the recent addition to the library of first
floor air conditioning. The effect of this
asset upon Davidson students can be seen
by the crowded conditions that exist in
the building all day, even during the
usual quiet part of the morning. Every-
one is in the rush to be first to lay claim
to a first floor seat, and without a word
the students by such actions show weil-
due appreciation to the party or parties
that were responsible for the cool atmos-
phere.

More important than this, however, has
been the great extension of shelf space
brought about by putting stacks the full
length of the fourth floor (second mezza-
nine). In so doing the library opened up
room for thousands of volumes.

In keeping with the new space are new
books. Books of import in all fields are
coming into the library in large numbers,
and the flow shows no sign of stopping.
It might be well for those connected with

the financial end of this influx to arrange
their appropriation so that the flow will
not stop or slack, but will increase in the
coming years. Davidson’s library by such
efforts could become more than an aver-
age institution: one of which those here
and elsewhere could be proud.

With all the recent improvements of
the library there continues on the part
of those who work there a spirit of help-
fulness and efficiency for which they
should be congratulated. In a word, they
are willing to help even when they find
themselves in the worst possible situa-
tions.

There is one suggestion that we be-
lieve might be made concerning the li-
brary hours. Many students make the
library the center of their scholastic life
here. Many more use reserve books over-
night or have other reasons for wanting
to be admitted to the building before the
beginning of first period at 8:20. If the
library could be opened from 8:00 in the
morning till 8:20 on a Sunday afternvon
basis (ie. with the desk closed), students
could get to work that much earlier using
library facilities which they might not
be able to get back to before chapel or
even before lunch.

Consideration of this matter would be
appreciated universally by the student
body, which has found the library so far
this vear quiet and efficient, a place
where scholarship takes precedent over
anything else, and where, therefore, the
Davidson student can feel that he is real-
ly profiting by college.

Paul Scott: An Athlete’s Dream Comes True

Too many of us, afraid to utilize our
powers of thought, have never endeavor-
ed to seek the purposes of physical train-
ing. All that we are able to do is to
initiate a monotonous rumble of gripes
bemoaning mandatory attendance at such
classes. Nor was the author to be ex-
empted from this category of ‘wailing
and gnashing of teeth,” until he had an
enlightning interview with Paul Scott,
retiring Athletic Director. Mr. Scott un-
veiled in understandable terms three
major tenets of his philosophy of physi-
cal training.

Everyone accumulates tensions and a
degree of nervousness from the pres-
sures of daily stiidies. It is also common
knowledge that the academic demands
intensify themselves during review per-
iods. To Mr. Scott physical training is
an escape valve for the steam of con-
tinual tensions. Forgetting oneself in
the rigor of a tennis match or, in general
terms, “breaking a sweat,” replenishes
the spirit. New desire to learn, new drive
to study is thereby acquired. A certain
coolness, a requirement needed in so
many instances, is recaptured by those
who give themselves rigorous physical
exercise.

The release of tensions enhances the
successfulness of Mr. Scott’s second tenet.
The student is given an extensive variety
of sports from which to select those of
his interest or those suitable to his per-
sonality. Most of the sports involve, un-

knowingly, cooperation and _ self-denial
for advancement of others. In the indi-
vidual sports offered, the student grasps
the meaning of dependency on his own
capabilities and the art of making quick,
correct decisions. It is Mr. Scott's con-
tention that the advantageous personality
traits learned in sports have great bear-
ing on one’s future success, especially in
business.

There is a definite need in everyone to
be recognized in some way by others. It
is a boon not only to the minimizing of
tensions but also to the devolpment of
a healthy personality to have this need
of recognition satisfied. In physical train-
ing, Mr. Scott believes that there is an
answer to this strong need. As each in-
dividual is unique, the amount of recog-
nition required varies from person to per-
son. Some must have the acclamation of
the crowds. Others, composing the ma-
jority, only need the approval of their
teammates in gym class to be satisfied.
The “slap on the back” to some means
as much as the admiration and praises
of the crowds to others.

Our previous unawareness and ignor-
ance of these basic principles of the goals
of physical training should not prevent
us from re-evaluating our ideas about it.
And let us in our new evaluation pay tri-
bute to the person who has incorporated
this philosophy into an outstanding, bene-
ficial physical training program at David-
son, Mr. Paul Scott —J.E.T,

Coach Whittle

No one was better qualified to take
over as Acting Athletic Director at David-
son than Heath Whittle, capable track
and cross country coach. This is the opin-
fon of Coach McKee, Publicity Director
for the athletic department.

Coach Whittle, a graduate of David-
son, has been on the athletic staff for
twenty years, and is the senior member
of the group. For most of that time he
has ably served as Assistant Athletic Di-
sector along with his other duties.

This experience, plus his natural abil-

ity to handle athletic functions, adds up
to continued competency in the regular
physical training, as well as in intercol-
legiate competition. The publicity de-
partment said that he planned to main-
tain the present method of individual
coaching in the “P-T” periods.

He is going to be a very busy man with
these new duties added to his regular
responsibilities with the cross country
and track team, but there is no doubt
about his ability to do a fine job.—F. L.

The Godfly

Is Davidson College
Cloister or Bar Room

By GILBERT GRAGG ‘

Why did we come to Davidson
anyway? This question honestly
answered by all students would
reveal almost as many and varied
responses as literary critics give
in explaining controversial sym-
bols in Eliot’s metaphysical poe-
try.

This seems a bit startling when
we consider that the majority of
students are from the upper-
middle bracket of the great Amer-
ican bourgeoisie (with a few from
the lower-upper) and from a sound
Calvinistic background of Sou-
thern Presbyterianism—certainly
it would appear with such a com.
mon heritage that the students
would agree more on why they
were at Davidson and what they
were expecting to get from it, but
this is not the case.

Some of the reasons we came
were because—‘our father lov-
ed thee and gave their best to
thee”—because it is generally ac-
knowledged to be almost the best
liberal arts school in the South
where a -“good past indicates a
better future,” and we wanted a
good foundation for graduate school
or seminary—because a degree
would give us a fast start toward
that first million we want in the
business or professional world—
because we got a good athletic or
academic scholarship—because we
wanted to have a good time pri-
marily and secondarily to do as
little work as possible just so we
could bave a degree from a high-
tanking school—and so the ans-
wers would go for most of us.

There are two extremes which
emerge from this array of rea-
sons that overlap in part, and
both are due to the fact that
we're middleclass and Presby-
terian. Let us realistically ex-
amine these two widely varying
attitudes prevalent unconscious-
ly at Davidson and see where we
fit into the pattern of hedonism
or ascetism.

Country Club? ;

“i'm so glad I came to a country
club instead of a college” says the
first extreme after finishing view-
ing an exciting TV show, settling
down to play bridge, and finally
hopping off to Charlotte or vicin-
ity for further diversion and en-
tertainment.

This group is intelligent enough
to make high marks at a less dif-
ficult school than Davidson but are
satisfied with mediocre work here
while prostituting their time and

. talents in other areas. One student

commented: “This is my last year,
and I want to have as good time
as I can,” which automatically
meant for him the less studying
he did and the easier courses he
took, the better time he would
have. This attitude that studying
and having a good time are incom-
patible is pretty prevalent among
all of us—certainly this group of
us is pursuing a policy of extreme-
ly expensive loafing (as Cop says).

This is the group who believe it
is unheard of to be seen on the
campus after Saturday noon or
before Vespers or you are definite-
ly a “square.” It provokes them
when people always think of Dav-
idson as a school that turns out
ministers only and where nobody
has any fun. Perhaps the real rea-
son those of us in this group came
to college is that everyone who
was anyone was going, and it

would not be fashionable to be
left out. On a closer analysis of
this group we all see ourselves in
some degree despite our denials
of it.

Monastery?

“How | hate to go back to the
monastery” is a frequent remark
of students returning from a gala
weekend of partying, who usually
try to steel themselves against any-
thing the Vesper preacher might
say which may threaten to pene-
trate their armor of indifference
and even whistle sardonically their
supposed approval when he be-
comes ludicrous. The word monas-
tery in student vernacular usually
applies to being cut off completely
from life at its best and being con-
fined to unpleasant tasks of re-
quired religious exercises and ri-
gorous studying.

Of course, the pursuit of knowl-
edge is most desirable, but some
of us just try to amass as many
facts and high grades as possible
forgetting. that the “mind is a
workshop and not merely a store-
house,” and that wisdom is the
knowledge of how to use informa-
tion rather than just absorb it as
a sponge. This extreme in their
desire to escape from the world
and grow intellectually spiritually
isolates itself in-an “ivory tower

existence” not concerning itself °

with the outside world, and. for all
they know New York could be
blown up by an atomic bomb since
the quest for knowledge does not
include responsible citizenship on
current events; certainly many of
us are guilty of the latter anyway.

College at its best certainly
should not be a retreat from the
world but neither should it be
an excuse for four full years of
scurrilous frivolity. The ideat
Davidson student of course
would be one who combined
great social and athletic skills
with ODK leadership end Phi
Bete intellectual qualities plus
a Christian ideal which is lived
daily, but this éombination is
hard if not impossible to find.

We all want to strive to be well.
rounded, but still it would be well
to remember that the chief reason
we come to. a liberal arts college
should be to learn to distinguish
between reality and appearances
and to learn how to live with our-
selves and our world; to learn that
it is necessary to be secluded a
great deal for intellectual stimula-
tion and religious meditation on
the great issues of life but also
important to remember that there
is a world “out there” and we
should keep up with it through
newspapers, magazines, and a sen-
sible amount of diversion.

The Answer

Monastery or country club?
Davidson is neither but can and
will be what each of us chooses
to make it. The alternatives ere
clear—surely the times are too
tragic. and the world’s sorrow
too great for us to give anything
less than the best we have to
getting the most out of our col.
lege education which is both e
tremendous opportunity as well
3s @ sacred responsibility.

if we give ourselves now
wholeheartedly to this high en-
deavor, years leter when we re-
‘member things past we will be
glad.

Drinking Statement
By Dean Spencer

BY SAMUEL R. SPENCER, JR.

In the hope of preventing inci-
dents which would require action
by the Executive Committee of the
Faculty, I would like to remind
the student body of the Faculty
regulation which reads:

“3. Drinking. Davidson College
is opposed as a matter of principle
to the use of alcoholic beverages
by students.

“A student will be suepended
from Davidson College if he is
Yound guilty of drinking, pos-
sessing, o¢ being under the in-
fluence of an alcoholic bever-
ege while within the town limits
of Davidson, or while attending
any off-campus event sponsored
entirely or in part by Davidson
College or any organization con-
nected with Davidson.

“Student drinking not covered

by the abové-mentioned rule may
be disciplined under Item 1 of the
rules stated under CONDUCT.”

Off-campus football games and
fraternity functions are clearly
covered by this regulation.

In addition, I would like to re-
mind the student body of the gen-
eral regulation as to conduct which
reads:

“1. Davidson students are ex-
pected to conduct themselves as
gentlemen. Any student who is
guilty of ungentlemanly conduct,
or whose conduct is such as to at-

tract unfavorable disciplinary ac-
tion. This action may be expulsion,
suspension, or some lesser penalty,
depending on the seriousness of
the act.’

STUDENT UNION LUNCH ScRAMALE

A Bit Beyond The Ivory Tower
With Mozart And The Bozarts

BY DUNBAR OGDEN

You have paid for it, why do
you not get your money's worth?
That is the question that went
through our mind as we noticed
the rather sparse attendance of
Davidson students at many of the
concerts and lectures presented on
the Davidson Artist Series through-
out the last several years. A num-
ber of outsiders have partially
helped to fill Chambers auditor-
jum on these occasions, but why
is it that at a liberal arts college,
noted for its interest in the arts
and the world about, there is ap-
parently such a dirth of realiza-
tion of the part that music, art,
and literature plays in our lives
and what these things can add to
us? Perhaps the near-sighted em-
phasis here sis on the parrot-like
repition of minutae. Perhaps the
fault then lies in the peculiar day-
today pace which we lead, in
which we are a bit blinded by the
pressure of immediate writs and
reviews. Certainly these are im-
portant — without question— for
we have chosen the four-system
under which we now live. But we
feel that there are great opportu-
nities for appreciation and self-
broadening that come to us every
now and then, such as the Artist
Series, which are optional. Unfor-
tunately many of us have not been
able to know the real worth of
these opportunities or have allow-
ed trivialities to overcome our
schedules, and thus, after paying
for our admissions to the series,
we omit most of the presentations.
People in town pay two dollars to
hear one of these concerts which
many of us avoid. When such gi-
gantic figures as Robert Frost,
Claude Rains, and Charles Laugh-
ton appear here, and we do not
take time out to hear them, we are
injuring ourselves.

This inability applies not only to

* the Artist Series in particular, but

to many phases of interest and ac-
tivity on as well as outside of the
Campus, Students criticize our in-
stitution as taking a small view in
many matters — of being a glori-
fied “prep school.” We agree in
certain cases, but the blame can
not be placed on the faculty or the
administration in most instances.
They deal with the student body
as a whole and if a certain adoles-
cent “mob spirit” overcomes the
students in general, they have lit-
tle recourse.

The incessant drive of the David-
son routine tends to discourage
broadness in experience and inter-
est, and we find ourselves caught
up in a whirl wind of class work.
We feel, that if we would only re-
flect for a few moments, we would
see the college experience in its
true light and then give it its real
place in our whole outlook. Thete
are things—many things—that are
to be seen and heard and felt and
absorbed outside of our books.
Comprehension of these realities
is a sign of real maturity.

Throughout this school year
eight presentations in the fields of
poetry, drama, art, and music are
to be given here on our own stage
in the Artist Scries. The typical
situation on the nights of the con-
certs in years past has been that a
fair number of students attend,
but a large percentage have some
writ or review fof wrich to study,

and most of these simply have no
interest in such things. Yet these
are the persons who shout loudest
about being treated like boys;
these are the people who haven't
enough maturity to weigh rela-
tive values in the balances of their
own judgment.

Tuesday evening one of the fin-
est chamber music groups in this
country, The American Chamber
Orchestra, is to give a concert in
our auditorium. Chamber music’s
forte is not in the thunderous cli-
makes of large orchestral passoeg-
es, which “‘thrill” so many casual
listeners. With a group of sixteen
players thematic material, perfec-
tion of tone, and balance are even
more important than in the large
orchestra. Musicians certainly pre-
fer to perform music for smaller
groups, although their playing
must be much more exact. Indeed,

‘it is many times more demanding

than large orchestral work as a
whole. The joy of chamber music
for the listener is not in the ov-

Little Mencken

erbearing pulsations of one’s ear
drums as the last chords crash
us from our seats, but is found in
the many themes employed, the
precision of the individual per-
formers which must stand out, and
the beauty of complete participa-
tion of the listener which consti-
tutes a true musical experience.

The works of Mozart, Schubert
and Handel, which are to be heard
Tuesday night, are milestones in
the great musical heritage which
is ours. These are the compositions
of the masters which have lifted
the hearts of countless audiences,
on which a bit of our being is built,
and which have made their authors

‘immortal as they present each of

us with a portion of their souls.

Here is an opportunity asking
us to take advantage, here is an
experience waiting for us to par-
ticipate: Will we be able to see a
little way beyond our “ivory tow-
er” and comprehend that which
is great?

Cigarettes G Cancer

By HIRAM CATON ‘

According to schedule, I rose at
6:30 a.m., lit a cigarette and dress-
ed. I opened the door and picked
up the morning paper, which the
delivery boy had thoughtfully
crumbled up in a heap. As I ex:
amined the news items from near
and far, my eyes came to rest on
an article which ensconced me into
clutches of fear, disconcertion,
and exhaustion. It was another of
those diabolic stories relating the
adverse opinions of doctors con-
cerning the relationship of ciga-
rette smoking to lung cancer. Hav-
ing been badly shaken by the im-
pact of the headline, I could not
bring myself to read the article
itself, and besides, it was time to
go to work.

Lipstick and Mouth Cancer
In the hour and a half that fol-
lowed, I tried to reassure myself,
I saw the whole situation as a plot
to push the cigarette companies
out of business. Perhaps some fa-
natic religious sect had managed
to infiltrate the medi profes-
sion and had started all mess
in an effort to achieve universal
acess for its “no smoking dec.
ie.”

Maybe before long we would
be hearing that lipetick causes
mouth cancer. | thought of «
few mere vegue reassurances,

recesses of my mind was ea hidi-
ous fear. it was o bad merning

ed at my eggs, | sew o malig

I did not have a class the first
period, so I went back to my room
and tried to sleep a while. 1
could not sleep. I attempted to re-
call who had been quoted in the
article. “Probably some stupid Is-

boratory technicians trying to
make a name for themselves,” I
mused. But if it had been no more
authoritative than that, why would
it be on the first page.

Afraid of what authorities I
might find quoted in the article,
I resolved to remain ignorant and
endeavor to forget that I saw the
abominable thing. Just as I got
to sleep, the bell for the second
class rang (it rings 33 times), so,
clutching my chem book, I dozed
off to class.

Some ignoremus From Harvard

That afternoon i was in my room
working on some math problems
when my roommate, who doesn't
smoke, came in. I had forgotten
about the morning’s mental con-
flict, and I was enjoying another
cigarette. With the piety of Saint
Peter, he picked up the paper and
began to read. Out of the corner
of one eye I saw him reading, and
for no reason at all I began to
perspire heavily.

Then he called my attention te
the cigarette article and cited
some of the men who hed de
livered judgment on cigarette
smoking: some ignoramus from
Hervard, an Idiot representing
the Board of Public Health of
the Stete of Massachusetts, and
60 on. | was enraged and curs-
ed fivently and violently. It wes
the morning’s experience ail
over again.

Since then, I have tried to stop
smoking. I have found it most dif-
ficult, but resolved to quit, I have
read many books on self-discipline,
stopped buying cigarettes, tried to
stop “buming” them, and almost
consulted a preacher. I don't know
what I am going to do about it;
life is miserable. Everywhere I
see delicious cigarette advertise-
ments; everywhere I am tempted.
Maybe someone ought to organize
a Cigarette Smokers Anonymous
maybe that would help. I don't
