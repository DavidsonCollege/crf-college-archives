Pe

l watched a tick swell at pulsating intervals,
Slowly, suletly, batein of his threshold as its

When slashes ofa burning lance ushered
Flashes of red insides through tight exits
Soon clogged by the ‘Steady veteran ‘oozers:
Who came first but left last.

Now I. can but pity you discriminate murderer
Who killed my substance but spared my life,
For | have lodged beneath your crusty skull
Latent trophies of push-button wars,

Wishing to remind you of that frigid day

When you smashed my soul but bade me to stay

Yes, |am the tick wearing a purple heart
Sucking old turnips in skeletons’ beds
And you are my lover, a cockleshell

On adry, listless beach far, far away. |
