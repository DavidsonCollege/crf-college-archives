This Saturday, March 23, at
8:00 p.m. in Love Auditorium,
Davidson College is once
again proud to present Voices
Inc.

Last year this extremely
talented group presented **A
Journey into Blackness.*’ This
year the company, under the
direction of Jesse DeVore.
will present ‘*Harlem
Heyday.”

‘‘Harlem Heyday” is set in
the roaring twenties and thir-
ties where the most exciting
and amazing music was
produced. It is a one-act
musical revue of Black
nostalgia that takes us back in
time to those incredible
vaudeville and theatre days of
the Old New York.

These were the times when
the Black performer was the
toast of Broadway, Duke
Ellington was creating a new
type of music, and when
Prohibition was sweeping the
country.

The sounds of ‘Harlem
Heyday” are those of ragtime,
the comedy teams _ that
people cheered for, the social
blues of uptown Harlem.

The dances they popularize
include the Charleston, the
Black-Bottom and__—itthe
Cakewalk. The music is filled

HARLEM HEYDAY

Kidnapping Comes To Davidson

Insanity lives. And just to
prove it, this week's column is
on the greatest example of
madness of the term - namely
the abduction (kidnapping) of
Mark Wilensky by DALPIM.

In case you don’t know it,
DALPIM is the Davidsonese
Army for the Liberation of
Palestinians, Impoverished

and Mieun. By kidnapping
Wilensky, they claimed to
lower the Jewish population of
Davidson by 20 percent.

Wilensky was kidnapped on
March 11. The demands of the
kidnappers were:

(1) A food distribution to the
Davidson poor through A.R.A.
meal tickets. (This is a favor

to the poor?) The Amount
stipulated was $45.27.

(2) The construction of a
townhouse-style dorm for
Palestinian refugees.

(3) A chocolate cake with
chocolate icing.

After the first ransom note
was delivered signs appeared

When Ingmar Bergman's ‘‘Whispers
and Cries’’ was released in this coun-
try, Jonas Mekas gave excellent ex-
pression to the dual attitude which
many critics have toward the film

One week, he named ‘‘Whispers and
Cries’’ the worst film of 1972. The next
week, he apologized and said something
to the effect that Bergman was in-
terested in film, and he was interested
in film, and he would always go to
Bergman’s movies, no matter how bad
they became.

American distributors have an
amazing habit of renaming Bergman’s
films.

For some reason, ‘Whispers and
Cries’’ was changed to ‘‘Cries and
Whispers”’, ‘‘A Passion’ tothe ‘Passion
of Anne’’, and for very obvious reasons
‘Sawdust and Tinsel’’ was changed to
‘The Naked Night.”’)

“Whispers and Cries’’ is one of
Bergman's worst movies - that is, one
of his serious movies. When Bergman
makes a serious movie, he doesn’t just
make a serious movie, he makes a
serious Movie.

He carefully avoids anything which
might emotionally involve the spec-
tator. As a result, the films are often
dramatically void and a pain to sit

“Whispers and Cries”’ is not as bad as
“The Seventh Seal’’ and ‘“The Shame’”’.
It is cliched as they are, but it is better
acted and more beautiful. Also,
Bergman indulges himself in a few
moments which create dramatic effects.
I would almost be tempted to hope that
Bergman never made another serious
movie, except that sometimes he
manages to get something onto the
screen which is valuable, which touches
the soul in the way it is meant to.

reel to reel reviews
“Whispers and Cries’

‘‘Persons”’ and ‘‘A Passion’”’, I think -
I have only seen them once and cannot
say for sure on one viewing - have much
of this.

In ‘‘Whispers and Cries’’, Bergman’s
subject is as usual himself. The film is
meant to be an allegory of his soul
and, by extension, of the viewer’s soul.

The film takes place inside a house,
the body. Red is the color of the inside
of the body, and the characters are the
forces within the soul.

The house is chiefly inhabited by
three sisters and their maid. There are
also some men, but they are just used to
set off or as reflections of the women.

Karin, the oldest sister, represents
the dark, repressed forces within the
soul. She cannot stand to be touched
and finds pleasure in slashing her
vagina. .

She is almost meant to be the devil
(the one in Christian theology and not
the silly goose who possessed Linda
Blair). The actress plays Karin and
Sven Nykvest photographs her that
way.

Ingrid Thulin is a husky, masculine
woman, well-cast in the role. She
manages to deliver Bergman’s ab-
straction with much more conviction
than it deserves. She is not at her best in
this film, but there are some moments
that remind me of why I thought her
great in Visconti’s ‘“‘The Damned”’.
Along with Glenda Jackson and
perhaps Geraldine Page, she is one of
the major actresses in the film of our
time. .

Agnes, the middle sister, and Anna,
the maid, are Bergman's ideal women.
They have an abiding faith in God and
are not afraid to touch each other.

Because her sisters do not love her,
Agnes is dieing of that old Bergman

stand-by, cancer of the uterus. Harriet

Anderson portrays her sickness and ~

suffering with simplicity and con-
viction.

Maria, the youngest sister , loves to be
touched sexually but is cold spiritually.
She is like her mother, whom we see in
flashbacks. Liv Ullmann plays both
roles. Miss Ullman has a pug nose, full
lips, pointing eyebrows, and a modest
amount of acting talent. The best
Bergman has ever done with her has
been to keep her from being an em-
barrassment. Generally speaking, he
casts her in roles much too difficult, for
her, andshe flounders. _

In ‘“‘Whispers and Cries’’, he has her
look into a mirror while a voice on the
sound track informs us that certain ab-
stract emotions are being registered on
her face. She gives a slight grimace as
each emotion is announced.

In another scene, the narrator an-
nounces that she has a face ‘‘so full of
sorrow.’’ The best Ullman can manage
is a slight pout. She is not an actress
capable of playing abstractions. In Joe
Troell’s “‘The New Land’’, she plays a
warm human being beautifully.

Some films end with a poof; suddenly
all problems are magically resolvedand
the film comes to a stop. ‘Whispers and
Cries” ends with a graceless kersplat.

The film is an unintentional self-
parody abqut four beautiful women who
beautifully suffer in beautiful places.
All the happiness is contained-Ker-
splat!-at the end.

This is a flashback to a happy day
when the women went for a walk and
played on a swing. Perhaps the film
would have seemed less cliched if Berg-
man had chosen to spread the hap-
piness throughout instead of putting
it all at the end.

on campus. The signs were
distributed by the SPKH
(Society for the Prevention of
Kindness to Hebrews).

Subsequent letters from
DALPIM threatened to
eliminate the Davidson
Jewish population by kid-
napping Shaul and ‘Sid Witz’.
DALPIM was considerably
hacked off by the arrival of a
cardboard cake covered with
chocolate icing.

On Wednesday evening,
DALPIM delivered a tape in
which Wilensky pleads for
deliverance from his kid-
nappers but says, ‘“They’re
really treating me pretty
good...they took me in out of
the rain the other day when it
rained.’’ DALPIM gets a
round of applause just for get-
ting Wilensky in out of the
rain. He’s never had the sense
to do it himself.

Apparently DALPIM got
tired of Wilensky by Friday
because he was returned on
Friday afternoon. Having
been totally spaced for a
week, Wilensky could give no
information about where he
had been. Good going Wilen-
sky!

All right, all right. So where
in all this bull (Hobbie is
cleaning up the act) is the
point of the column? Well, it’s
like this. As usual in my
column, there is no point. But
if there were one, it would be
something like this.

The kidnapping of Patricia
Hearst is no joke. It is a
horrible experience for her
and her family. The point of
the kidnapping seems to be the
intent to highlight the con-
ditions of the poor. The food
distribution plan is just one
way of doing that.

Here at Davidson we laugh
at ourselves a lot. We are a
small community and our con-
nection with world events of-
ten seems tenuous.

Every now and then we get a
chance to help the poor get
food - not by sending chocolate
cakes to DALPIM, but by
helping the YMCA distribute
food stamps in Davidson.

The contribution of time will
not be more than a few hours
if there is some interest
shown by the student body.

It's not much, but every little
bit helps.
