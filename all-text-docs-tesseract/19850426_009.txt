Coach Greer’s Accomplishments Can't Be Overestimated

By ANDY BARRON

Any of you who weren’t out watching
the Davidson-Western Carolina baseball
games this weekend weren't doing any-
thing. The three-game extravaganza that
decided the champion of the Southem
Conference’s South Division lived up to
its advance billing as a weekend packed
with exciting baseball. All three games
were close. More importantly, Davidson
swept the series and won the division
championship. As Fernando would say,
“Guys, you looked MARVELOUS!”

This weekend capped the four year
overhaul of Davidson’s baseball program
by Coach George Greer. Any team that
wins a championship passes out thanks to
anyone who ever had anything to do with

| the program. Congratulations are due to

“Swim! Golf! Play! And Still Tkae Advantage of our Summer

‘

the managers, aides, and players, espe-
cially the players, that made this season a
success. Yet, in the midst of the
euphoria, one can’t overestimate the
accomplishments of Coach Greer. Every
player on the team came to Davidson be-
cause of George Greer’s recruiting tal-
ents. The hitting explosion that lit up the
New scoreboard occurred because of

Coach Greer’s skill at coaching hitters. In
fact, the new scoreboard stands due to
Coach Greer’s organizational skills:
George Greer is definitely my choice for
Southern Conference. Coach of the
Year.Congratulations team; but more im-
portantly, congratulations Coach Greer.

Though the baseball team knows it is
in the Southern Conference play-offs, the
women’s tennis team must wait to hear if
they will participate in the NCAA Divi-
sion III championships. The defending
National Champions are 18-4, with all
but one loss coming at the hands of Divi-
sion I schools, and are currently ranked
number one in the nation (NCAA Divi-
sion III). The team is confident of receiv-
ing a bid and continues preparing to de-
fend last year’s championship.

Now that I’ve finished patting backs,
it’s time to pull up my pants and correct
some errors. First, Alfredo Griffin no
longer plays for the Toronto Blue Jays. I
still believe the Jays will win it all, how-
ever, and I would like to thank Steve
Byers for pointing out this mistake, again
and again and again. More importantly,
new head football Coach Vic Gatto

Predictions

Time for hockey and basketball pre-
dictions. Hockey and NBA basketball are
an appropriate pair; I don’t care about the
NBA and most people around here don’t
care about hockey. Nevertheless, I'll
gaze into my crystal ball and give you my
champions..

Edmonton will beat Philadelphia in
six games to win the Stanley Cup. The
Great One (that’s Wayne Gretzky to all
you barbarians who didn't know) won't
be what wins Edmonton the Cup; the
overall team talent of Edmonton will beat
the Broad Street Bullies. Since the play-
offs remain far from over, you'll have to
store this prediction in the ol’ memory
banks; that is, if you care about my
prophecies.

To me, basketball season ends at the
conclusion of the NCAA tournament.
The NBA play-offs cannot hope to equal
the excitement of the Villanova-Geo-

Tgetown game that ended another fantas-
tic winter of college hoops. Just to give
everyone something to argue with me
about, I think Los Angeles will beat Bos-
ton 4-3.

If I were a Braves fan, I'd be a bit
concerned. As of this writing, Atlanta is
5-7 despite the fact that Dale Murphy can
do no wrong with his bat. What's going
to happen to the Braves when Murphy
cools off? Bruce Sutter isn't going to be
much of an asset if the Braves’ starting
pitching can’t give him the lead.

Now that I've riled up all the Braves’
fans, I can go on to something else. How
about the Hagler-Hearns brawl. Some-
body must have told these guys that they
were only fighting five rounds, The fight
was so short that it was shown on TV
twice on Monday night. I think Marvel-
ous Marvin Hagler should host Saturday
Night Live. Fernando (making his sec-
ond appearance in this week's column)
could start their interview by saying.
“Marvelous, darling, you
look . . . bald.”
