the big drawing card for most of
the Betas this week-end, To them
went Brothers Bob Raney, Monk
Caterson, Nat

Garrison, Joe
Walker, Wil-

and Frank. Rawley. Also going
along was Pledge Brother Newell.

Brother Paul Welch had a “high”

Salisbury, Hickory and Charlotte.

Coming into the home st ‘
the Sigmas are really putting out
for their last flings at the social
world. The biggest congregation
went to Greensboro for the W. C.
dances, where our noble Brother
Taylor was. pleasantly surprised
when his date brought “the” blank-
et, due to his forgetfulness. Fol-
towing’ with other blankets for a
picnic after. the dance were the
Brothers “All Smiles” Scott. and
“No Expression” Amos. Those
three brothers were joined by
Brother Holland and Brother Mor-
gan for the usual song fest that
follows-a W. C. dance, and this
combination of five turned it into
Sigma with
ease.

Feeling the call to travel far for
satisfaction, Brother Peters (Tee)
made it-all the way’to the Capital
City to see his beautiful blonde
of Charlotte; Brother Booth made
the usual “every six weeks” trip
-to Farmville; Brother Williams
kept the women of Sweetbriar liv-
ing hard; Brother Miller went to
Converse, and it is useless of course
to mention the name of his femi-
nine company; Brother Sutton
carried his racket to Statesville
(tennis racket, of course); whereas
Brothers Davis~ and Wilkinson
thought home was the most invit-
ing haven. for the week-end fray.

Co-captains Bill Lacy and (Gee)
Peters led the Davidson track
team to a victory over S. Carolina,
with many points being added by
Brothers Ben Lacy, Turnbull, and

Dr. Cunningham further stated
that the Atlanta group believed
that there are two types of negro
1) the extreme radical,
who wants all so¢ial barriers -brok-
en down and that done at once; 2)
the calm, intelligent leaders, who
desires the raising of negro condi-
tions to equality but not
“mingling.”

White Leaders

On the other hand, there seem
to be three types of attitudes held
by the white people: 1) the ex-
treme radical who believes with
the first type of negro leader; 2)
the “old guard” Southerner who be-
lieves that the negro is all right
“in his place,” the phrase meaning:
all right as long as he continues
to subservient and say, “Yas -suh,

says, “Sure, I like the negro O.
K.," but then promptly, forgets

the whole matter.
Dr, Cunningham mentioned some
of the-recent race riots, particu-

lunta group seemed: to be to raise
negro cducational, health, and eco-
homie conditions and standards’ to
proportionate with white levels.
Many appalling examples of un-
fairness and plain crookedness in
nearby and respected communities
were cited by Dr, Cunningham.

“One thing that is difficult to}
comprehend,” he declared, “is the
slowness with which the Church,
including our own, is facing this
problem. It seems to-be the opin-
ion of intelligenty leaders every-
Where, both Christian and non-
Christian, that it is the Church’s
position and duty to lead in the
alleviation of the problem.”

Improvements
Before closing his talk, Dr.
Cunningham pointed out a num-
ber of heartening indications of
improving conditions in the past
few (years, particularly in educa-
tional fields. ;

When asked what each man
could do to help the problem, Dr.
Cunningham repfied, “Keep your
eyes and ears open for any and
severy opportunity to help, if only
in conversation and argument
with others. We must realize that
we have a real responsibility, al-
though:we must be cautious ever
to be sane and level-headed.”

Three Denials

Second scene of Peter was the
one where he denied- Christ three
times. The actions of Peter in this
scene illustrate the dangerous
things leading up to a denial of
Christ. Peter was only following
at a long distance. He then hud-

enemies of Christ, and associated

Four of thé disciples had been
fishing on the Sea of Gallilee all
night long without any luck. When
they were coming in early in the
morning, Jesus told them to go
back out and throw the net out on
the other side of the boat. When
they did this, they caught a large
number of fish. Peter was so im-
patient to get to the shore and see
his master that he jumped over
board and swam ashore. Jesus was
waiting there and had a breakfast

scene shows the practicality of
Christianity. The first thing that
