Barksdale, two Davidson

At 10 am. Sunday, April 7,
Cole and Barksdale beganrun-
ning. down Highway 115 to-
wards Charlotte, Three hours

They had run this course 23
minutes faster than any other
Davidson student ever had.
The distance is 24.6 miles.

Their efforts had far ex-
ceeded their expectations.
They had overcome such ob-
stacles as speeding trucks,
heavy traffic and a sun that
burned hotter with each
stride.

The weather made them
both quite thirsty, so their run
was interrupted twice by 30
second pauses for refresh-
ment at drink machines.
Despite these obstacles, Cole
and Barksdale overcame their
fatigue and sore feet in record
time.

This run is a tradition at

We have come a long way in sports at Davidson
during this past academic year.

Most notable was the revamping of the football
program by the Board of Trustees. Davidson will
now be aligned in Division III of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association. This group con-
sists of schools which grant financial assistance to
gridders only on the basis of need.

Football continues the new look with a new men-
tor. Ed Farrell replaced Dave Fagg, who resigned
to take a post under Pepper Rogers at Georgia

Tech.

Farrell has signed some key prospects for the
coming year and is blessed with a schedule that
makes predictions of a winning season very com-
mon. It is quite possible that the Cats could have
one of their best records ever in the coming cam-

paign.

Basketball also sports somewhat of a new look.

But he is a newcomer to the
ranks of head coach after replacing Terry Holland,
who left to accept the head post at the University of

cat athletic staff.

Girls made the Davidson scene this year as the
college became officially coeducational. With this
change appeared a girls basketball team, along
with their tennis counterpart, as well as a female

certainly be considered a change for the better on
the Presbyterian campus.

Baseball came on strong in the end of the season.
But they will also have a new look, as head coach
Tom Stevens will be leaving Davidson in June, ac-
cording to informed sources.

Finally, the campus will sport a new, all-weather
track for the coming year. This will be one of the
finer athletic facilities on the campus.

Oh, and this year also saw the first broadcasting
of Wildcat athletic events on the campus radio

station, WDAV.

So, all in all, it has been a year for change. Let’s
just hope this present trend continues.

November 1971. At that time,
Davidson students Ron
Clarke, Howard Boyd, Randy
Coble, Joe Shibley, Steve Bon-
neville, Dave Reid and Don
Butts completed the distance
in three hours and 28 minutes.

Cole is an experienced long
distance runner who has run
in four marathon runs. A
marathon is a run which is 26
miles 385 yards long.
Nonetheless, running to
Queens is not an everyday
event. Even experienced run-
ners like Cole wonder if they
can do it.

“Tradition was one of the
main reasons I ran,”’ he said.
‘Plus I wanted to see if I could
do it. I was out of shape. You
never know if you can finish at
any distance.”’

Barksdale had never at-
tempted such a distance
before. ‘‘It was a spur of the
moment thing that intrigued
me. It sounded challenging
and I wanted to see if I could
do it,’’ he said.

Running has become an im-
portant aspect of the lives of

Cole and Barksdale.

shape,”’ Cole commented.
Long sustained runs like the
one to Queens tend to be quite
painful. But Cole
“After running with pain, you

“You run when you hurt
because you know you are get-
ting in shape, so that next time
you won’t hurt as much and
will enjoy it more,” Barksdale
commented.

“Also, the pain is com-
pensated up to a point by the
exhileration.”’

like riding a bicycle.” _
