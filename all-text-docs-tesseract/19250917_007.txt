. Honorary Journalistic Fraternity
Initiates Nine Leading Journalists
of Davidson

After continuing more than a year
| without extending additional bids, the
Delta Pi Kappa Honorary Journalistic
Fraternity initiated nine men from the
present Junior and Senior classes just
prior to commencement last year. The
newly elected members of the fraternity
are C. F. Smith, W. E. Milton, R. B.
Parker, A. Y. Bowie, G.. M. Eddington,
C. F. Monk, Harllee Branch, Jr., Don
| Wharton and P. F. Jones. The first six
men are members of the Senior class,
while the latter three are members of the
present Junior class.

Delta Pi Kappa is the only Journalistic
Fraternity on the Davidson campus, and
was organized several years ago. Since
its establishment it has achieved much
prestige among the other honorary or-
| ganizations at Davidson, and has limited
its membership strictly to students who
have shown extraordinary brilliance and
| promise in Davidsonian and Magazine
work.

Each of the new initiates have justified
their election to the fraternity. C. F.
Smith, as Editor of the Davidsonian and
in other capacities has earned an en-
viable reputation as Davidson’s most
versatile writer, being equally gifted as
,an editor, poet, humorist, and short-story
writer.

Roland Parker has gained fame not on- |

ly as Associate Editor of the Davidson-
lian, but also in the capacity of Essay

and Alpha Phi Epsilon.

A. Y. Bowie won recognition

a leading member of the Reporters’ Club. |

Club and Alpha Phi Epsilon. |

recognized on numerous occasions, and |
was finally rewarded by his election to)
the editorship of the Davidson College
Magazine in the spring clections last |
year. He, too, is a leading member of |
Sigma Upsilon. |

Harllee Branch, Jr., present managing |
editor of the Davidsonian, the highest |
honor bestowed upon a Junior in journal- |
istic circles, has won much praise for his

The speaker always commands the attention
of his audience and this time did not prove
an exception to the rule. The freshmen
seemed to be pleased and amused with this
presentation. :

| NEW STUDENTS ARE ENTER-
|

Nick made a powerful talk to the men; a
straight from the shoulder talk, assuring the
freshmen. that the old men of Davidson were
glad to have them and that great things were
expected from this class. Sappenfield urg
the new men to enter into every field o
activity that they possibly could, at the same
time devoting enough time to their studies.
At the close of Sappenfield’s talk it was
announced that a moving picture show was
the next thing on the program. The presen-
tation, “The White Desert,” proved to be a
very interesting movie. The scenes showed

as Hendrix Returns to

Take Up Graduate Work

The joy and the clamour of the Old Guard
'of France over the return-of the master
leader Napoleon from the island of Elba was
mild compared to that in the hearts of the
Wildcats when. the news flashed over the
Davidson campus that Jim Hendrix was
back for another year. Napoleon returned
for the famous Hundred Days, but should the
eighty days that intervene between now and
the Thanksgiving game be as memorable as
those of the past season they will exceed in
importance, to the Davidson student body at
least, the aforementioned Hundred Days.

Few football players have captured the
admiration of the Davidson campus as did
Jim Hendrix last season. Following a rather
| mediocre game his Junior year, when he was
| playing out of his normal position, Hendrix
leaped into sporting light of the state with
| some of the greatest backfield playing of re-
cent years of Davidson football.

Hendrix in speaking of his return says
that he has come back to Davidson to better
fit himself to enter the medical school of the
University of Pennsylvania.” He says that
he has much work to do, work that is more
important than that of the gridiron, though
he spoke highly of that.

The student body in welcoming Hendrix
back to the campus again see in his return
more than that of the ordinary football
|player, As president of the student body
the past session, as a leader in establishing
the Biology club, as a prominent member of
many of the honorary fraternities of the

school, and as a leader in the social, fra-
ternal and social life, Hendrix was one of
the outstanding men of his class. It is ex-
pected that he will again be a vital force
upon the campus.

Y. M. C. A. ARRANGES FOR
NOTED SPEAKERS

(Continued from page 1)

The Y. M. C. A. will have this year a
series of programs that are sure to be help-
ful with the support of the student body.
Many things are expected this year and let
us hope that indeed it can be said when the
year is over that we harbor no vain regrets
over not having attended our “Quota,” which.
should mean every program of “Y” meetings.

Don't think that is a pessimistic view; we
don’t intend it that way. It is merely con-
servative.
