Bruins beat Cats 3-0

With 1:11 left in the first half, the
Davidson men’s soccer team and a si-
lenced crowd of 3,226 finally knew
what the Cats were up against. On what
can only be called a world-class goal,
UCLA junior Pete Vagenas put the Bru-

ins up 2-0.

was an amazing shot which left both
athletes and spectators stunned. The
Sth ranked Bruins would score once
more to leave Richardson Field with a
3-0 victory.

After a shaky start, in which the
Cats gave up anearly goal to All-Ameri-
can Seth George, the Cats settled down
and showed they would hang around
longer than expected. Davidson was
led by an inspired performance by se-
nior keeper Marshall Tyler. Tyler was
constantly challenged, but always rose
to the occasion making many brilliant
saves along the way. At both the.34:57
and 23:21 marks, Tyler stopped George
twice at point-blank range. Tyler’s
great play continued throughout the first

half. It appeared that UCLA senior
Tom Potl was about to score when he
beat Tyler with 4:15 remaining, but his

shot bounced off the post. Seconds”

later, Shaun Tsakiris controlled the re-
bound and shot to Tyler’s right, only to
be denied by a spectacular kick save.
While Davidson was outshot 14-4
in the first half, they played very well
after struggling early. Davidson’s first
real chance came with about 17 minutes
left in the half. After a struggle in front
ofthe UCLA goal, Drew Lindsey played
a good ball into the box, but it was
picked up before Randy Culbertson
could get to it. Five minutes later,
junior Andrew Holbrook had a one-on-
one with UCLA keeper Nick Rimando.
Holbrook played the ball around
Rimando, but pushed it just left of the
post. With 11:26 remaining, freshman
Paul Watson almost tied the game, but
his shot went just right of the post.
About midway through the first
half, the momentum began to shift in
favor of the Cats. The Cats had success
in controlling the midfield, limiting
UCLA’s attack, and creating quality
scoring chances. Unfortunately, just as
it appeared Davidson was about to knot
the score at one, Vagenas silenced the
crowd with his incredible goal. Still,
Davidson almost rebounded right away
as sophomore Ikenna Myers almost
caught the Bruins’ defense sleeping.
With under a minute left, Myers’s shot
was deflected by a lunging Rimando.
Aftera frantic first half, both teams
slowed the pace down in the second
half. Physical play was up, while shots

and scoring opportunities were down.
Davidson had the first real scoring
opportunity of the half. Sophomore
Dane Erickson received the ball off a
corner kick and rifled a shot over the
UCLA wall, but was stopped on a
diving save by Rimando. For the most
part, possession in the midfield was
relatively equal, if not slightly in favor
of the Cats. UCLA put the game away
inthe 73rd minute when Martin Bruno
scored on a fast break off an assist
from Chester Goodson. Davidson
pressed on and almost scored in the
game’s closing moments. Culbertson
challenged Rimando with 1:07 left.
This led to a corner kick on which
sophomore Andy Murray had the
keeper beat, but was stopped by a
diving defender.

Even though the Cats fell to 0-4,
they held their own for most of the
game. Against most opponents, this
performance would have been good
enough for at least a tie, if not a win.
Still, UCLA gave Davidson a demon-
stration on what it takes to be among

‘the national elite.

The Wildcats recurring problem .
is the failure to finish scoring opportu-
nities. “We’ve had chances, but just
haven’t been able to put the ball away,”
said junior co-captain Hart Roper.

Over the weekend, Davidson
went 0-2 against Yale and Brown at
the Brown University tournament.
Against Yale, senior forward Richard
Kleiman scored the only goal of the
weekend on an assist by sophomore
midfielder David Buehler. Awards

game last Wednesday.

for the weekend included co-captain
Brad Stroble as the defensive player of
the tournament and David Buehler as a
member of the All-Tournament team.
The current record is now 0-6.

previous games. However, Cornelius
was still disappointed, saying that the
team did not play up to their full poten-
tial.

“It’s unfortunate to loose, espe-
cially in OT,” Cornelius said. “We have
high expectations. It’s not that huge of
a setback. We’ll be able to come back
with our next conference game.”

This is the second year ina row the
Wildcats have fallen one goal short
against their conference foes. Last Sep-
tember the ‘cats lost by a score of 2 to 1.

Making the loss even harder to
swallow was the fact that the Wildcats
were unable to garner their first win of
the season. Earlier in the week, they

fell to Wake Forest University 4-0, drop- ”

ping'their record to 0 and 3 overall and
0 and 1 in the conference.

Despite the disappointing losses,
the Georgia Southern Game was evi-
dence of marked improvement in the
team’s defensive play. They did not
surrender a goal for 90 minutes and
junior goal keeper Chesley Garrett had
a solid performance.

The offense, on the other hand, has
yet to make its presence felt. Through
four games, the Wildcats have found

that the Wildcats have a very challeng-
ing schedule the slow start to the season
is more likely due to challenging oppo-
‘nents more than a lack of effort. As
Head Coach Kevin Hundley pointed °
out earlier in the season, the Lady Wild-
cats are encountering very difficult

_ teams, many of which have legitimate

chances of making the NCAA tourna-

Looking ahead, the team will look
to earn their first win either tonight at 7
