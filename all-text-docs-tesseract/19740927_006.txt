Verities of Earth And Sky

Jackson Fuses Abstract, Super-Real

A Review

By VINCE RABIL

A very unique exhibition
opened last Sunday in Cun-
ningham Fine Arts Building--
a representative showing of
Herb Jackson’s work over
the past 15 years.

Although the overwhelming
majority of the work was
executed within the last four
to five years, we are able to
see a definite continuity in the
evolution of Jackson’s style
since 1959.

At first glance one may

assume that Jackson’s work is
abstract-nonrepresentational
or devoid of correlation with
nature. This is not the case.
*“$ackson shows a_ steady

development in the direction

of super-reality.

It Shows an obsession with
physical mass and volume,
with temperature, with tex-
ture, with the verities of earth

and sky.

In viewing Jackson’s work
chronologically,.we are able
to see several transitions,
recurring themes, and an
emerging direction and

stylistic climax. We can see

Jackson as he matures from a

14 year old who is immitative,

of styles not altogether his, to
an artist who produces per-
sonal, high level in-
terpretations of physical
space, texture, tension, tem-
perature and mass.

From the glimpses Jackson
gives us of his early work, we
are able to see many things
going on in his turbulent young
™ind.

Three works, ‘Cathedral
Window,” ‘‘Rock Strata’”’ and
‘Bow Down and Worship,”
were done at the ages of 14,16
and 17. They: are religious in
tone and not original in style
but contain the spirituality
and concern for texture which
reappear in subsequent
works. nhs

Works produced from the
ages of 19 to 23, such as “‘Night

of the Owl’s Eye,’’ ‘“‘Creation’

Myth,”’ ‘Black and White
Mattress” and ‘‘Quiet Room,”’
reflect the period of his
coming of age .as an in-
dependent individual who is
breaking with parental
authority and is creating and
declaring himself.

The recurring themes of
night, the underlying sexual
elements, and the search for
privacy and peace reveal an
emotional involvement that is
generally absent from his
paintings of the 1970’s.

Jackson’s love affair with
clouds and sky begins in 1969.
In works such as “Space
Mirrors,” ‘‘Ice Wall,” ‘‘For-
tress’’ and ‘‘Double Window,’’
we see a new stylistic tighit-
ness and direction emerge as

he attempts to quantify space

‘f / fj

in a-floating, open system of

mass and volume.

From 1969-to 1973 Jackson’s
explorations of celestial space
and form continues. During
this time new things begin to
appear. _

He slowly fills his delineated
space-volumes with solid
mass, which he'draws closer
to the forefront'in successive

paintings. ‘‘Delphi’’ and
‘‘Open III’’ illustrate this
process of solidification.

By 1972 Jackson has moved
from the cool freedom of the
skies to the warmth and
security of earthen-matter
which seems to erupt with
volcanic intensity in 1973 in
works like ‘‘Tracer’’ and

| progressively
4 emotional expressions in or-

“‘Eastern Light.’’

With his quantification of
the aerial sphere complete,
Jackson seems to be entering
the realm of hot-matter in 1974
with his reinterpretations of
texture and temperature that
he freezes beneath rhoplex.

A comparison of his 1961
“Rock Strata’’ with his 1974
“Small Grid’? seems to in-
dicate that some sort of vast
stylistic cycle has completed
itself over the course of 15
years.

The major trends in his work
appear to climax in “Rare
Earth” in 1974, as an uncanny
tension _and balance is
established between extreme
heat and energy underlying
cool matter and freezing
rhoplex.

In this review I have dealt
primarily with the changes oc-

‘curring in Jackson’s pain-

tings, but one should also

_ hotice the consistency in his

works of upward- movement

‘ and controlled rhythm by

judicious use of parallel lines.

Thus, in this representative
showing we see Jackson in the
process of purifying
metaphysical experience by
eliminating

der to catch a direct vision ot
selected elements of nature in

the subtle realities of their
existence.

His efforts have resulted in
work that is very tight, very
mathematical, very clear,
vibrant, and lucid.
