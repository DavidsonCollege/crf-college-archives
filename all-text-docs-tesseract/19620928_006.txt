Union’s Job Carnival

Brings Bus

A Career Carnival, which is being planned by C.

Shaw Smith, director of the

representatives of leading companies to campus to di
cuss career opportunities with the students.

The Career Carnival, to be
held in the lobby of the Student
Union during the middle of
November, is a pre-placement
program for al! students. It is
designed to help, in particular,
freshmen, sophomores, and jun-
iors who are undecided about
their future occupation.

views; however, interested
seniors are invited to attend.
The opportunity for students
to learn just what type of man,
a particular industry wants will,
be a feature offered by Career
Carnival. Rather than attend
group lectures, the student can
roam at will among separate
career booths in the Union lobby

Pirially, succeeding, he wiped
_the sweat from his brow with a
igrimy glove and looked con-
fidently up the precipice ...
straight up to another narrow
ledge before an opening in the
stone, his destination.

The ropes groaned and whistl-

metal karabiner, a loop attach-

Davidsonian Fihe Arts Critic

Agamemnon. I would like

Last night the Vagabonds presented their first pro-
ion of the 1962 fall season, the Greek tragedy

to congratulate Dr. Goody-

koontz and his cast for a fine: production.

To attempt to produce
Greek tragedy is in itself a
notable undertaking. Some
authorities have called Agamem-
non the greatest of the Greek
tragedies. The performance of
the play depends greatly on the
tragic mood and the poetic ef-
fect. For these reasons few
drama groups have even at-
tempted to produce the play.

The production last night

was outstanding in two areas.

The character of Clytemnestra

as portrayed by Aeschylus is

one of the most powerful cher-
acterizations in Greek tragedy
and at the’same time it is one
of the most difficult roles to
sustain. Miss Judy Harrison
did a magnificant job in her
role as Clytemnestra. The
audience was drawn into the
very horror of Clytemnestra‘s
position. Throughout the en-
tire play one was continually |
aware of this woman’s deter |
mination to seek revenge. —

Again | wish to congratulate |

Miss Harrison on a splendid

portrayal.

The second exceptional aspect
of last night's performance was
the power of the so-called Cas-
sandra scene, This is perhaps
the emotiona? climax of the play
for Agamemnon’s death follows
almost immediately. Here at
this point in the play Y witnessed
one of the most powerful and
moving scenes I have ever
watched. Miss Cornue’s per-
formance was superior in every
way. For Cassandra was the most
tragic of al! human beings. And |
this scene was last night’s most.
effectively and powerfully por-!
trayed.

There were, however, certain
weaknesses in the performance,
But I am acquainted with the
almost insurmountable obstacles

did not reach the audience as
well as it should have. This waa
brought about in part because
the intervals of humor, especial-
ly after the death cry of Aya
memmon, were a bit overplayed
and oweremphasized.

The second criticism is that
the fempo of the play was too
slow. By this ! mean thet it
dragged, especially in tte
chorus scenes. in some ceses
it was difficult to Keep: ttre
attention of the audience be-
cause of this.

Finally, I feel that: I could
pay no higher compliment to
the director and the cast than
to urge all the students and fri-
ends of the college to: attend
this fine production. I await
with expectation the future pro-
ductions of the Vagabonds.
