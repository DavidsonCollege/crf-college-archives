Stevenson For President

With the presidential elections only
four days off, the American people face
the gigantic responsibility of choosing
the man who will guide the destinies of

this country and the free world for the |

next four years. Events of the past two
weeks have graphically underscored the
momentous importance of the nation’s
decision.

As this dullest of campaigns has un-
folded, we have waited and watched, hop-
ing that the candidates’ stands on the is-
sues which concern the country would
enable us to arrive at a clear-cut, decisive
choice for the presidency. This has not
been the case. Sharply conflicting view-
points on basic, fundamental questions
have been scarce.

And so it has been necessary to weigh
the parties and their candidates in the
light of the issues on which they do differ
to a degree, and in view of the men them-
selves who compose the two major tickets.
With these criteria in mind, we herewith
formally announce our endorsement of
Adlai E. Stevenson for President.

In many respects, the choice for us is
a lesser of evils. We are not wild about
Stevenson, and our choice must be
thoroughly qualified. Moreover, it is not
simply support of the Stevenson candi-
dacy as such, but stems from the compar-
ative merits of both tickets, including the
vice-presidential candidates, and of the
political parties which they represent.

Perhaps the most valid argument
which can be made for Stevenson’s can-
didacy is that his concept of the presi-
dency is in direct contrast to that of the
ailing President. Even before Eisen-
hower’s two major illnesses, much of the
government was run by personal appoint-
ees—Hagerty, Sherman Adams and the
rest. In addition, Ike has repeatedly re-
fused to take responsibility for the often
irresponsible actions of Dulles, Nixon and
other subordinates. wr

In Stevenson, the Democrats have a
candidate in the tradition of Woodrow
Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, who be-
lieves that the proper function of a pres-
ident is more than that of a coordinating
administrator. Stevenson believes in the
necessity of presidential initiative, and
would, we feel, push his program of posi-
tive legislation to the hilt, working closely
and directly with the Congress, something
which Eisenhower has notably failed to

do.

Republican foreign policy under John
Foster Dulles has been sadly wanting.
There has never been a concerted effort
to attain definitely defined goals in our
relations abroad. It has been vest-pocket
diplomacy at its worst. American prestige
all over the world has deplorably slipped
in the past four years, primarily because
allies and potential allies never could be
sure just what our attitude towards them
was.

In agriculture, on the other hand, the
Eisenhower administration has stead-fast-
ly refused to make political hay at the ex-
pense of our overall economy. Great
strides have been taken to alleviate the
situation of tremendous surpluses inherit-
ed from the Truman regime, and now the
farm economy is gradually finding stabili-
ty.

The health issue, which the Democrats
have not abused as thoroughly as they con-
ceivably might, still looms large in the
minds of many voters. In a word, the
prospect of Richard Nixon in the White
House completely appals us. Yet this pos-
sibility is certainly conceivable with a Re-
publican victory next Tuesday. Nixon’s
cloudy record, with its opportunism and
wavering allegiances leaves him as an ex-
tremely bad presidential risk.

Regardless of the results of the elec-
tion, the embattled South can expect no
sympathy from the successful candidate
as it attempts to face realistically the
situation which has provoked more
hatred and stagnation of progress than
has been seen here since the days of Re-
construction. Nonetheless, we feel
with a Democratic President and Con-
gress, the South will be in a better posi-
tion in its struggle for time and local
authority which it needs in order to cope
with this problem with a minimum of
bloodshed and violence. Southern Demo-
cratic leaders have recognized this fact
and have accordingly ignored third party
attempts, while more or less actively sup-
porting Stevenson.

While our endorsement of Stevenson
is of necessity and conscience qualified,
we believe that under his dynamic and
farsighted leadership in both domestic
and foreign affairs, the United States
will, in the next four years, be better able
to deal with the sobering challenges
which constitute today’s civilization.

Court Makes the Grade

This year’s Court of Control died a
quiet death Monday afternoon. Its execu-
tioners were the objects of its own per-
secutions, the Freshmen. They accom-
plished their coup d’ etat, however, in a
completely legal fashion. They beat the
Sophomores in their annual field day
competition.

Monday evening saw this year’s Court
fold up its robes for another year and re-
tire to the pages of Davidson College
history.

For the Court of Control this was its
year of decision. Last year’s Court was
an utter failure. They lost control of the
Freshmen, failed to instill Davidson tra-
dition in the class, and were removed
from chapel because of the lack of co-
operation on the part of the student body.

If the court had failed in its function
again this year, if it had failed to win
student body cooperation and support,
this famous old Davidson institution
would have gone the way of the five-day
chapel and the double-breasted tux.

However, under the powerful leader-
ship of Judge Reitzel Snider and his seven
associate justices, this year’s Court re-

gained its rightful position in campus life
and opinion.

Judge Snider reformed, revitalized, and
renewed the Court, presented squarely
to the student body the fact that if they
did not cooperate, the Court was doomed.
Most important of all, he returned the
Court to its necessary place in chapel.

The Court met with remarkable success
in its efforts. Freshmen, for the most
part, either obeyed the rules of the Court
and the traditions of Davidson, or they
paid the consequences. Freshmen riots
were held to a minimum.

It is to be noted and praised that the
Court met death while it was still func-
tioning properly, that the Court of Con-
trol retired while the Court was still in
control. The Court can be buried with the
knowledge that it had a job to do and
that it did it well.

Judge Snider and his associates have
set the example of a dignified, competent
court dedicated to the-purpose of instill-
ing the Davidson tradition in the Fresh-
man class and of punishing those who
violate the Freshman regulations:

It is up to future courts to follow this
example.—A.W.F.B.

Adlai E. Stevenson

Dynamic Leadership Necessary

Adlai to Implement
The “New America”

By GERALD WILSON

“The defect of democracy,” con:
cludes the philosopher Spinoza, “is
its tendency to put mediocrity into
power.” At no time in the history
of our great democracy has this
weakness been more apparent than
at the present day.

In 1952, the American people
went to the biggest white elephant
sale in the history of the country,
and they bought starry-eyed.

There is but one real issue
in the 1956 campaign—the
candidates.

The so-called “Grand Old Party”
has again chosen a successful sol-
dier, trained in the military tradi-
tion, but sadly lacking in admini-
strative ability, and naiye in poli-
tics. The American electorate must
choose between the two.

There have been many at-
tempts made by the Republican
Party to present Eisenhower
to the American people as a
man above party, above the
taint of politics. But in doing
so they have overlooked two
fundamental weaknesses in
this policy.

Pirst, by placing Eisenhower
above his party, they have ad-
mitted frankly, that it is he, and
not the party that the people will
vote for. Thus they are forced to
repudiate their own policies and
political philosophy.

Secondly, by separating Ike
from politics, the Republicans
have divorced him from the busi-
ness of government, which is by
definition “politics.”

The Republicans have attempted
to sell us Eisenhower again with
the slogan ‘Peace, Prosperity, and
Progress." Yet these words appear
readily as the utterances of false
prophets. There is no peace in the
Mid-East. The East is held downs

The challenger...

only by an “armistice.”

Prosperity is a real thing for
big business, but it has failed to
“trickle down” to the smaller en-
terprises and to the midwestern
farmer.

Progress has passed by aid to
education, public housing, and
foreign policy.

But the American people
must not vote merely
AGAINST something. They
must have a candidate that
they can vote FOR. This man
is Adlai E. Stevenson.
Stevenson’s past record has

proved his ability to carry out
the progressive policies of the
Democratic Party. The strength of
the Democratic Party has always
been in its philosophy that gov-
ernment should be. for all the
people and not just a privileged
few.

Stevenson will further the
positive government action

vitally needed in the fields of

education, . agriculture, and

sociel welfare.

The American Peopie once again
have the opportunity to elect dy-
namic leadership in the tradition
of Jackson, Wilson, and Franklin
D. Roosevelt. Adlai Stevenson is
a‘ great American, he would be a
great President with a_ positive
program for a “New America.”

Political
Glossary

So many words have crept into
our language which men use dif-
ferently that 1 thought I might
moke a glossary to aid those
readers who like such things .. .

Reactionary: A fellows who be-
lieves that in the 8,000 or 9,000
years of recorded human history,
something happened before 1933
that is worthwhile.

Repubtican—tisenhower: A Re-
publican, Democrat, New Dealer,
or arch-reactionary who believes
that President Eisenhower is the
greatest President since Harry Tru-
man and that his success is as-
sured.

Republican—Taft: An old-timer
with some memories of Harding,
Collidge, and Hoover who wanted
Robert A. Taft to be nominated in
1952 and never got over it.

Middle-of-the-Road: I am _ partic-
ularly perturbed about the middle-
of-the-road because if it is im-
possible to define with precision
what is right wing or left wing,
how does one find the middle?

Facist: A fellow who disagrees
with the New Deal but is not a
Communist. The term may be ap-
plied to anyone, particularly to a
Son and Daughter of the Ameri-
ean Revolution and to one who be-
lieves that the United States can
get along without the United Na-
tions.

Demoecrat—Southern: A Demo-
crat living south of the Mason-
Dixon line, who is emotionally
conditioned not to vote for a Re-
publican even when he prefers to.

Democrat—New Dealer: An ad-
herent of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Charlotte Observer.)

STUDENT AND FACULTY OPINION

Davidsonians View the Election

By LAURENS WALKER

As election eve approaches, it is
interesting tb note the reaction of
the Davidson faculty and student
body to the issues of the campaign,
to the thousands of words of pro-
poganda poured out by both na-
tional parties, and ‘to the personal-
ities of both presidential candi-
dates. The reactions of typical
“Davidsonians” follow:

Doug Ballentine, “Considering
the Suez crisis, | believe that Ei-
senhower will be re-elected.”

Professor Beatty, “As a firm be-
liever in the party system... I
shall have to support the Demo.
cratic Candidate.”

Dan LaFar, “Eisenhower ... due
to middle East situation, “a shoo
in.”

Professor Ratliff, “Thus far,
I haven't seen enough difference in
the candidates’ positions . . . How-

ever, I see Stevenson as the man
most qualified for the Presidency.

Lee Chapman, “I support Eisen- -

hower.”

Professor Chalmers Davidson,
“All my life I have been devoted
to lost causes, and while I’m not
willing to admit this is one, its be-
ginning to look like it. I'm for
Adlai!”

Pete Morrisett, “I'm for Eisen-
hower. He's done a good job.”

Brownie Hamer, “Personally I
don't like either one.”

Tom. Lee, “Conger and I are for
Stevenson.”

Professor Johnson, “I'm not one
hundred percent for either.”

Doug Stewart, “I support Eisen-
hower because I know that he has
a strong Christian faith.”

Ed Young, “ ... A conflict in
personalities rather than issues.”

Professor Ford, “ Stevenson by

a narrow margin.”

Jim Kuist, “I think that Mr.
Stevenson is a very intelligent and
able man .. . President Eisen-
hower can give the country the
leadership’ which we need,

Bit) Cobb, “Ike by a closer vote
than in °52.

Tim Kimball, “Eisenhower, the
lesser of two evils.”

Harold Westervelt, “I'd vote for
anybody to keep us out of Egypt.”

Professor Cumming, “Eisenhow-
er, I am not happy about the
foreign affairs achievements of
Dulles, but I see no evidence that
there would be any improvement
if the Democrats come into gov-
ernment.”

Lanny Voight, “We need Eisen-
hower’s military knowledge.”

Bill Witkinson, “The way things
are now, I'd be scared to death if
Stevenson won.”

that spells the difference be-
tween the Republican Party
and the Democrat Party is:
whet is the proper role of
government in the lives of
men?

Abraham Lincoln, the first Re-
publican President, took his stand
on the side of the great truth
that the legitimate object of gov-
ernment is to do only those func-
tions which the people cannot do
in their separate capacities.

President Eisenhower has
said that the proper function
of government is to be liberal
in dealing with people, but
conservative in dealing with
the people's money.

To promise everything to every
minority group, to court every
political bloc, and.to tax and tax,
and to spend and spend is not,
therefore, the proper role of gov-
ernment.

Today the most aggressive
force of left-wing minds thet
ever commanded a position of
national importance has cap-
tured the party of Jefferson
and Wilson. Organized tebor,
regimented minorities, and
collectivist dreamers have in
filtrated and subverted the
once proud bulwark of in
dividual freedom.

‘The Republican Party, however,
under the Eisenhower leadership,
will guard against those who
would substitute short-term ex-
pediency for long-run statesman-
ship in order to woo the AFL-CIO,
the ADA, and the NAACP.

The party of Lincoln and
Eisenhower will stand watch
against creeping eneroach-
ment of government to master
the lives of men. )

Dwight Eisenhower and the Re-
publican Party offer American
“dynamic” leadership, and they
take their stand on the side of

e+. and the champ

true liberalism. The true liberal
believes in the widest latitudé of
personal freedom within the
bounds of society. They believe in
the right of the individual to pur-
sue his own happiness, and not
have some alphabetized agency
pursue it for him!

Playing Sente Claus to the
public and posing as the Great
White Father will not fool
those who know that what-
ever the government gives
you, it must first take from
you.

The party of Eisenhower is,
therefore, the party of true liberal-
ism, dynamic conservatism, and
free enterprize.

Because it is the party that re-
wards and glorifies success rather
than penalizing initiative and
imagination, the hopes and aspira-
tions of future generations will
share in the “American Dream” —
the reality of the greatest abun-
dance for all resulting from the
greatest measure of individual
freedom and enterprize.
