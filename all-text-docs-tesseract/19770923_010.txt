Local anist recordsdebut abun

It’s finally happened — John
Stanfield, Davidson’s own
crazy wandering minstrel, has
released his first album.

It’s called Carolina 12-
String, and John took a break
from his circuit touring last
week to peddle a few copies
here at his old stomping
grounds. I bought one, more
for curiosity and old time’s
sake than anything else. You
see, young circuit musicians
always seem to cut their first
record with sore cheap studio
that doesn’t really know what
it’s doing, and I suspected
John’s fate to have been the
same.

I must say I was pleasantly
surpised.

Fretless, a division of Philo
Records, managed to capture
Stanfield on a disc that is
almost noiseless, not to men-
tion the incredible clarity they
got from the guitar pick-ups.

Yes, technically the album is
almost perfect. John chose his
company well.

He also chose his music
well, for the most part. If
you've never heard Stanfield
before, [ suppose you could
describe his style as a folkish
conglomeration of Leo Kottke,
John Fahey, and John Hart-
ford...but mostly it’s just
Stanfield. The songs on the
album, which were all written
by him, are typically elaborate
and ornate, showing off (and
why not?) his amazing guitar
work. the instrumentals, par-
ticularly ‘‘The Eagle’’, are
very impressive. Although I
don’t usually think of John as
a vocalist, more than half of
the songs have lyrics, some of
which are quite good (‘‘Jeremy
Lokum”’, ‘Rails and Fences’’,
“Jenny”’) and some of which
just seem to get in the way (as
in ‘‘Katherine’’, which other-
wise is a beautiful song). And
of course, the album wouldn’t
be Stanfield’s if it didn’t have

Bogey comes back strong
in vibrant Sacchi portrayal

By KAREN HESTER

Famed movie idol Humphrey Bo-
gart died 20 years ago, but he was
alive and well in Love Auditorium last
night. Look-alike Robert Sacchi re-
created the star of ‘‘The African
Queen”’, “‘Casablanca’’, and numer-
ous other films through famous
Bogart scenes.

A native of New York City, Sacchi
emphasizes the fact that he tries to
recreate Bogart, not imitate him. ‘I
try to show Bogart as he would be
looking at the '70’s, besides imitating
him in his favorite roles,’’ says
Sacchi. ‘‘That’s why I call the show,
‘Bogey’s Back’.”’

The impersonator adds his own
humor in the performance when he
gives a glimpse of Bogart’s reaction
to the ’70’s. ‘‘In my day,” says Sacchi
as Bogart, ‘‘grass was something you
held a picnic on or got buried under.

‘Things were rotten in my day.
They're still rotten. But in some ways
they’re different. A kiss is still a kiss,
but today it covers a lot more
territory.”

Sacchi’s resemblance to Bogart,
right down to the lisp and half-smile,
can be humorous at times. He
explains, ‘‘Just last week, I was
driving to a show and had stopped at
a red light.

“A car pulled up next to me, and a
woman passenger rolled down the
window to ask me directions. Her
eyes lit up and she said, ‘You look
exactly like Humphrey Bogart.’ Little
things like that happen all the time.’’

Because of the trend toward nest-
algia, Sacchi finds that college stu-
dents can relate to his’ performance.
He adds, ‘ft fiuc vonegéewtudents
know more about the past than the
people who lived it.’’

Sacchi began performing the col-

‘lege circuit around three years ago

because he finds college audiences
profitable and attentive. ‘It would be
hard to find night club audiences for
my show,” he admits. ‘‘No one goes
to the night club anymore when they
can see the same thing on television.”

In order to look, act, and talk like
Bogart, Sacchi has read all his

biographies and seen about 40 of his |

75 movies. With all that preparation,
the impersonator finds no difficulty in
playing the role.

In fact, he was Bogey in Woody
Allen’s hit play, ‘“‘Play It Again
Sam,” and in television commercials
for Ford and Busch Gardens.

In high school the kids always told
Sacchi he looked like Bogart. ‘‘I
wanted to look like Paul Newman.
Bogey was an older guy. But if the
idea for an actor is to keep working,
I'll eat better if I stick with Bogart,
not Newman.”

a couple of the odd little
numbers which made John so
popular around campus—
“Snapping Turtle Boogie’ and
“Alligator Stew”’ got in there,
too.

My biggest complaint with
Carolina 12-String is that it
isn’t live. John works best
with an audience, and on the
record it’s obvious that the
microphone and the engineer
just aren’t responding. Also,
it eould have used some sim-
plicity in spots;...the break-
neck guitar, skillful as it is,
tends to dazzle you after a
while. The album should be
listened to in short bursts.

John himself is understand-
ably pleased with the overall
result, and so is Fretless. They
want him to do another album,
which Stanfield says should be
out next summer. If it is as
good as Carolina 12-String, it
will be worth waiting for.

(WDAV will feature Caro-
lina 12-String Monday night
at 9 pm.)

DID YOU do a double take? No, it’s

Bogart.

G.G. Kosch
enlightens

By NANCY McNAIR

Using such commonplace tools as
spray paint, crumpled paper and
paper cut-outs, Charlotte artist G.G.
Kosch has created a collection of
prints and serigraphs on display in
the Union Lobby through October 5.

‘It is so easy to overwork a
painting,’’ she said ‘in an interview
yesterday. ‘‘At each point I must
stand back from the work. It is
awfully hard to stop.”

Kosch works in various media:
acrylic, acrylic sprays, serigraphy,
and watercolors. ‘‘I use whatever
means necessary to achieve the
desired effect,’’ she explained.

Working from an enclosed porch
converted into a studio, she keeps
files of source materials close at hand
for her work. “But I don’t get ideas
until I am actually working. I see a
relationship between everything and
art,”’ she added.

“Sometimes I walk in there with
trepidation—hesitation, worrying—I
must start anything, something,
whether it is messing around with
crayons or dabbing with watercol-
ors,”’ she said.

Previous Kosch exhibits have been
held at the SECCA in Winston-Sal-
em, the Weatherspoon in Greensboro,
and the Asheville, NC, Museum. Her
works have appeared in single and
dual shows, as well as group competi-
tions.

Kosch has studied at UNC-C, the
Flat Rock School of Art, and the
University of Guanajuanto in Mexico.
