Young outlines

Senate activities

By KEVIN WHITE

The SGA, looking back to
past successes, has planned a
busy fall term in the continua-
tion of many programs with
the hope of new input and
innovation, according to SGA
President Thom Young.

Its first activity is coordina-
ting the election of freshmen
class and dorm senators on
next Tuesday, September 27.

In the past, this election

’ process was long, drawn-out

and confusing.

This newly reformed elec-
tion process marks the first
time that elections for both
class and dorm senatorial of-

_.. Stuart duo gear for Davidson years

Pontinued from page 1]

Both men were very pleased
to see a new scholarship
program based solely on merit
established at Davidson.

“I think it’s always nice
that you have at least one
program that’s not devoted
‘strictly on need,’’ said Wad-
dill. “It gives you a chance to
be sort of independent of your
parents.”’

Craven echoed these sent-
iments. ‘‘I think too many
scholarship are given to people
because of financial need. Fin-
ancial need is something rela-
ting more to the parents than
to the student.

“T like the idea of a strictly
merit scholarship; if you’re
going to have a merit scholar-
ship it should be based on
merit and not financial need.”

Waddill has a wide range of
outdoor interests including
track and cross country, out-
ing club activities and water-

skiing.

He expressed delight with
the many activities Davidson
offers. ‘‘You can stay busy all
the time and not go to a single
class and not do any studying
just with the extracurricular
activities.”

Craven's interests are also
far flung, ranging from swim-
ming to religious groups to
music.

‘*There are a lot of things
going on here if you have the
time to do them —and some-
times if you don’t have the
time to do them,”’ he grinned.

Both students were deligh-
ted with the friendly attitude
of the Davidson community.

“It’s an atmosphere that
would facilitate learning and
the social aspects of life,’’
explained Craven. ‘‘One in
which a student can contribute
a lot to the community.”’

Craven did not feel that the
frequent complaint about

Davidson's lack of diversity
was justified.

“Diversity is really where
you find it. It’s out there but
perhaps it’s a little harder to
find here than at other
schools.”’

Waddill put it another way.
‘‘To me there’s been a lot of
diversity but maybe that’s
because I’m just overwhelmed
by the newness of it all. A
small school like Davidson is
not going to be as diverse.”’

Davidson's faculty scored
high marks with these Stuart
Scholars. ‘‘The faculty seems
to take a more human interest
in you,” said Craven.

“They all seem very friendly
and willing to help you,’’
added Waddill. To these ath-
letically -minded freshmen
Davidson’s intramural prog-
ram was a big drawing card.

“The intramural program I

think is fantastic. I have a lot
of praise for it because it’s for

everybody. It’s a good way to
get involved in athletics,’’ said
Craven.

Waddill also was impressed
with the amount of participa-
tion in intramurals but felt
that the gym was somewhat
overcrowded.

WADDILL

Craven was pleased that
Davidson is now coeducation-
al. Waddill agrees but thinks
‘it would be nicer if they
would even up the ratio.”

fices will occur on the same
day.

Bolstered by the success of
helpful course evaluation
handbook, the Course Evalua-
tion Committee will continue
their efforts with a major
emphasis on student input.

“The problem is whether or
not these student-run course
evaluations should be used as
an evaluation of the faculty,’
commented Young. “Dr. Zim-
merman (Vice President for
Academic Affairs) and I agree
for the need of student input
into the important matter of
faculty evaluation. Dr. Zim-
merman is at work on this
now.”

Campus Security is another
SGA concern for this fall. This
Campus Security Committee,
headed by Hans Watford '79,
was responsible for the instal-
lation of emergency phones in
all dorms last year.

There will also be a major
emphasis on improving stu-
dent-faculty relations this
year. Square dances and sing-
alongs will continue. An SGA
reception for the new faculty,
doctors, associate dean and
academic vice-president is also
being planned for early this
term.

In addition, various ad hoc
committees will be formed as
issues arise. A current ad hoc
committee is analyzing David-
son’s admissions policy of a
specific interest in increasing
the ratio of women to men.

Plans are set. But as Young
concluded, ‘‘The potential
from student input is unlimi-
ted. I encourage all students
to take advantage of the SGA.
We need to know their inter-
ests and ideas.”

Foreign study broadens, enlightens

‘For people who have been through
a year at Davidson and are unsure of
where they are going, or are looking
for an alternative to Davidson Col-
lege, Junior Year Abroad (JYA) can
be a broadening and enlightening
experience.

There is not a better time in
your life to go. You are never as
free, you can never go as economical-
ly, and it is easier to meet people
because students have a universal
appeal,’’ said Tony Boon, Coordin-
ator of International Studies. David-
son offers JYA programs to enable
students to study at French, German
and English universities.

JYA in Montpellier

Students electing to spend a year in
France study at the Universite de
Montpellier. As full-time students
they participate in the academic,
social, and cultural life of the school.

To ease the transition from an
American to a‘French way of life,
JYA students to France take a course
at Davidson designed to a¢efuaiin

them with Fratice. This’ course,

offered to these students during the
spring of their sophomore year, deals
with the culture, customs, and life-
style of the French people. This is
followed up with six weeks of inten-
sive language study when the stu-
dents arrive in Montpellier in Sep-
tember.

Beth Anderson was one of the
sixteen Davidson students who went
JYA to Montpellier last year. She
went because although she enjoys
Davidson, she’ felt she needed a
change.

Develop independence

Anderson learned that while spend-
ing a year in another country it is not
hard to develop self-reliance and
independence.

Anderson said that although the
French students she met were friend-
ly, she was the one who had to make
the first-move to be friends. Early in
the year ‘Anderson had to fight
feelings-of loneliness, but before long
she had formed close friendships with

_ several French students. She also

took advantage of the opportunity to
meet students of other nationalities.
Anderson found the language bar-

- mer Somewhat of a problem at-first.

She described -her occasional inability

to express herself as ‘‘a humbling
experience.’’ However, as the year
progressed, Anderson became increa-
singly able to communicate effective-
ly in French.

Anderson, a sociology major, took

a variety of courses at the university.
Among the subjects she studied were
sociology, English literature, compu-
ter math, religion, and French liter-

fered only to Christian apsjicants.

This scholarship involves more
money than any other award at
Davidson but, as White points out ‘‘it
is not a Davidson College scholar-
ship.”

The award comes from outside
sources who may therefore restrict it
in any way they wish.

White compared the Stuart Scho-
larships to the National Achievement
Scholarships sponsored by the Na-
tional Merit program which is restric-
ted to Black students.

White does not feel that limiting
the scholarship to Christian appli-
cants influences to any great extent
those students considering the col-
lege.

On the other hand, White contends:

thae*Davidson's Statémenc of Pure -

pose, which presents the College as a
church affiliated school, may influ-
ence some students in their decision
as whether or not to apply.

He believes that having the appli-
cant comment upon the Statement of
Purpose forces him or her to take a
look at this aspect of the College.

‘We want to present Davidson as it
really is and then let the high school
studnet decide for himself whether he
feels he and Davidson are compati-
ble.”

As far as the future is concerned,
White is hoping for even more
applications that last year’s high of
1500. From all indications so far, he
will not be dissappointed.

The number of interviews in Au-
gust alone was double that of last
year. White’s last comment on at-
tracting applicants--‘‘of course, win-
ning football szmes»won’* b.-*.’
