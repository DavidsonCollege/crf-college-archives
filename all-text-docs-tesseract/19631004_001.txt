Those careless days of sum-
mer vacation may be different
next year. The Student Council
is seriously considering a pro-
posal for required reading lists
-over the summer.

This idea, which would in-
clude the entire student body,
‘would require each student to
read a certain number of speci-
fied books during the summer
and take a test on them in the
early fall. While many students
already attending Davidson have
had experience with such a sys-
tem of parallel reading as is be-
ing proposed, the entire concept
‘would be novel to this college.

The institution would have
its disadvantages as well as its

L

advantages, according to the
Student Council. The intended
purpose would be to broaden
the individual student's know-
ledge by smoothing out the
rough edges in his education.
The idea would be to fill in
the gaps in each student's
studies.

While diversification would be
one aim, no one would be assign-
ed books totally unrelated to
his interests; for example, a pre-
medical major might be requir-
ed to read books concerning the
history of medicine or philoso-
phy’s relation to medicine. The
mathematics major might be as-
signed books on the sciences or
perhaps: business. While the

Student Council Weighs

Ten members of the Class of 1967 were called before
the Freshman Court Tuesday night in the first disciplin-
ary action taken against violators of the Freshman Regu-

lations.

More than’30 names have been reported so far; how-

ever, only the 10 worst violators were summoned before
the court this week, according to Chairman Tommy Staf-

ford.

The freshmen were found
guilty and were placed on “work
details” according to the ser-
fousness of the offense. Other
information, including the
names of the violators, was not
announced by the court.

In an interview this week,

Exile From Cuba
To Speak Thursday

A former Cuban ambassador
to Great Britain under Fidel
Castro will speak in chapel next
Thursday. Oct. 10, basing his
talk on the current Cuban and
Latin. American political situa-
tion.

Sergio Rojas, who fled the
country in disillusion when it
turned communist, participated
in the Bay of the Pigs invasion
last year and has spent a good
deal of time in West Germany
and in studying the prosperous
economic revival and change
that has taken place there.

Feeling that the Castro re-
gime will eventually tumble,

Rojas hopes
wr a that such
knowledge will

be instrumen-
tal in return-
ing Cuba to

democracy.
He was ac-
tually a leader
| of the revolu-
a | tion that
brought Castro to power. Work-
ing as a coordinator in Venezue-
la, he purchased arms, raised
funds and sought various sup-

port for the July 26 coup.

When the bearded leader took
over the government, Rojas was
the first ambassador appointed.
During his year in Great Brit-
tain, however, he became dis-
illusioned with the regime's
switch to communism.

He returned to the country,
and, under the threat of arrest
and possible death sentence, he
submitted his resignation. He
quickly sought asylum in the
Argentine embassy and fled the
island 65 days later.

Now Rojas is director of the
Cuban Center for Studies of
Freedom, a group comprised of
Cuban exiles throughout the
world who are waiting for op-
portunity to return to their na-
tive land.

classmen to show a _ greater,
awareness of the regulations. “It
seems the student body is apa-
thetic to the regulations as it is
to most other things around
here,”’ said Stafford who is also
Freshman Advisor. “Since most
people don't seem to be showing
any interest, the freshmen feel
that there’s no use to wear the
beanies and name tags and all,”
continued Stafford.

“Everybody just seems to be
kind of lackadaisical about it
all,” stated Tiff Harrington, a
sophomore member of the
court, as he pretty well sum-
marized the feelings of most
upperclassmen.

According to Stafford, the
names of violators can be given
to any member. of the Freshman
Court. Besides Stafford and
Harrington, the members are
Jerry Trammell, Dave Lopp,
Tom Whitley, Will Jackson and
Dave Hardeman.

Stafford also announced that
freshman hall representatives
have been elected. Each fresh-
man hall elects two students as
members of the Freshman Coun-
cil. He plans to call the group
together within the next week,
so that plans can be started for
Freshman Parents Day, which is
sponsored annually by the
Freshman Council. Parents Day
is scheduled this year for Oct.
19.

Hardeman is chairman of the
Freshman-Sophomore Field Day,
which is tentatively scheduled
for sometime in the week of
Oct. 21. if the freshmen win the
field day, they will no longer
be subject to the Freshman Reg-
ulations. Otherwise the regula-
tions will be in effect until
Thanksgiving.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C. FRIDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1963

Summer Reading Scheme

reading would undoubtedly de-
velop into a problem or some,
there would be a certain num-
ber who would greatly benefit
from the idea.

John Spratt, president of
the Student Council, proposed
@ resding period prior to
exams. Though the idea would
be completely new to thé Dav-
idson campus, it is as old as
Harverd, Princeton and Yale.

The proposal would remain
fairly conservative—and would
involve sacrifice by students as
well as faculty. Spratt proposed
the faculty agree not to hold
classes three days before the
examination period in exchange
for the students’ giving up one
day of their Christmas holidays.

The purpose of the reading
period would be to give the stud-
ent time to draw his ideas to.
gether and to avoid confusion
before the exam. In addition, he
would be better able to grasp
the entire gist of each course,
according to Spratt.

An alternative to the reading
period was also discussed. The
proposed idea was to have a per-
iod before exams during which
professors would not give tests,
thus allowing the student to
better focus his attention to the
entire course rather than to the
recently covered part of the
course.

Union To Sponsor
Post-Game Party

The College Union will spon-
sor another open house and com-
bo party immediately following
tomorrow’s Davidson-VMI foot-
ball game with music provided
by the “Swinging Five.”

After the combo party a buf-
fet supper will be served in the
Morrison Room of the Union.
The serving will wind up in time
for the Josh White concert to-
morrow night. The supper will
‘be open to all students with or
without dates.

Staff Warren was optimistic
after the big attendance at last
week’s open house and express-
ed the hope that the same recep-
tion would be given future
Union plans.

- On Saturday, Oct. 12, the Col-
lege Union will co-sponsor with
Queens College a concert and
dance in honor of the ‘Queens
Davidson classes of ‘67. All the
upperclassmen from both
schools are invited.

The joint concert will feature
folk singers Brown and Dana,
a local group on the way up, in
the Queens auditorium. Follow-
ing the concert, the combo will
begin in the Queens gym at 9.

Music will be provided by
Davidson’s own Sidney Farrar
and group for one hour. They
will be followed by the Contin-
entals who will play until break-
fast. Since girls may receive
“late permission” from Queens,
breakfast will be served in the
sorority houses at 12:30.

It was announced that this year Independents would

need tickets to be admitted to the concerts. Tickets are
on sale to Independents at a price that will save them
money if they buy a ticket which is good for the whole
year. Tickets will also be available for each individual
concert. It was pointed out that the new ruling is merely a

means of enforcing a section in the IFC regulations.

In other business, the IFC
proposed a joint alumni-student
picnic on Homecoming Weekend
with the understanding that it
would be taken to the various
fraternities, discussed, and then
decided upon at the next meet-
ing. The plan would be to have
a buffet style picnic in the cen-
ter of Patterson Fraternity
Court.

The installation of alumni of-
ficers could be made more in-
teresting by cutting it short
enough to allow time for the

resentative from each of the 12
fraternities and the Lingle
Manor Group. The main advan-
tage of the outing would be
student-alumni contact.

John Spratt announced plans
for Wednesday night visitation
by the Richardson Scholars at
the various fraternity houses.
Under the present system, the
scholars are assigned to a par-
ticular house.and are not given
a good opportunity to make con-
tacts outside these houses. With
the new system, they would ro-
tate and visit a different house
on Wednesday at the evening
meal and afterward. The IFC

ly.

that the committee had taken
interest enough to ask for and

Freshman Campus Rioting
Gains Increasing Concern

BY JOE DAVIS

The Student Council, Honor
Court, and the college adminis-
tration are becoming increasing-
ly concerned about freshmen
riots on campus.

After the enthusiastic pep
rally last Friday, rumors circu-
lated that freshmen were plan-
ning a riot. John Spratt, presi-
dent of the Student Council,
said that he had heard the rum-
ors and found them to be true.
Spratt explained that the fresh-
men had planned a “beanie
burning” at midnight and then
a “raid on Belk.”

Spratt and Howard Arbuckle,
chairman of the Honor Court,
took immediate action to pre-
vent any violence. Their strategy
was to break up the riot where
it started, with certain individ-
uals in the dorms. With the aid
of the Honor Court and Student
Council members and the hall
counselors, Spratt and Arbuckle
were able to prevent the mass-
ing of the freshmen and a sub-
sequent riot.

The causes of the riots seem
to lead to the upperclassmen.
When questioned as to the cause
of the riots, a freshman answer-
ed, “When we first came to
Davidson, the upperclassmen
began to tell us of past riots and
tradition which we must up-
hold.” Arbuckle said that defin-
ite action would be taken against

upperclassmen who were stir-
ring up trouble.

“One big blast would be good,
but now they've had too many,
and we’re required to take pre-
ventive action.”

Arbuckle also warned the
freshmen about using abusive
language between the dorms
at night. The alumni were
here last weekend and he seid
that the freshmen were asking
for trouble. :

Spratt said that the Student
Council and the Honor Court
were not opposed to. have fun;
and allowing the freshmen to
blow off a little steam. The dan-
ger lies in the chances of a ser-
ious accident as a result of the
riots. He also pointed out that
the damage to school property
could not be permitted.

Mrs. J. B. Moore, supervisor
of dormitories, agreed with
Spratt and Arbuckle in the fact
that personal injury and prop-
erty damage must be prevented.
She wished that other outlets for
the exercise of spirit could be
found. She was glad to see the
students disciplining themselves
as they did last Friday.

Spratt has talked with Mrs.
Moore and Dean of Students
Richard C. Burts about finding
something to replace the void
left by prohibiting riots. He said,
“IT realize that the ban on riots
possibly can stifle freshman
spirit, and I'm open to any sensi-
ble alternatives.”

COUNT PRESENT LUXURIES

school has to pay.

“What with a call to Queens
only costing a dime and the fact
that most of the boys call home
collect, I'm surprised that the
company stays in the black as
far as the students are concern-
ed. Fifteen boys can talk as long
as they wish for a dime and
frequently do!”

Mrs. Moore added that there
are two phones for 8 residents
in Duke and that there were al-
most as many people on one
floor of Belk as there were in
all of Lite,

“The schog] dosen't plan te
add dag wens phomes; frere is

too much damage to the existing
ones. Cords have been cut and
windows in the booths broken.
The students want more phones
and yet don’t take care of the
ones they have. Moreover, 1
think that the three new phones
have relieved the pressure; and
if anyone needs a phone, he
finds one without too much
trouble.”

As far as more vending ma-
chines in the dorms, Mrs. Moore
explained that there isn't
enough room for any more than
there are at present. Machines

the requirement of four 1000-
word essays, instead of the seven
500-word themes and one 2500-
word term paper required last
year. Thompson states that this
was done because the composi-
tion requirement of English 11
was satisfied in Humanities 11-
12; in. the second-year program,
the composition requirement
should reach for greater depth
as found in English 21-22.

Sophomore Rufus Adair typi-
fied the student reaction: “The
change eliminates the drudgery

of a term paper each semester
and allows much better develop-
ment than was allowed on the
shorter themes. You can explore
deeply four subjects each semes-
ter this year rather than the one
covered by the term paper last
year.”

Two changes have been
made in the format of the dis-
cussion groups. Questions
which were included in the
first year syllabus to help
guide the discussions have
been eliminated by the sec-
ond-year staff. Discussion
leaders will guide their re
spective groups for an entire
semester, instead of changing
groups on a quarterly basis
as was done last year.

“The questions forced the
students’ minds into the narrow
confines of the particulars
brought out in them, more than
they aided him in extracting an
understanding of the work as a
whole,” said Chip Sanders, a
second-year ‘student, in evaluat-
ing the changes. “I feel, too, that
the discussion groups will func-
tion better as the semester pro-
gresses and not be hampered by
a mid-semester change in pro-
fessors and discussion format.”

“No conscious efforts were
made by this year’s staff," said
Dr. Thompson, “to make the
program any easier—with the
exception of omitting class a day
before each review to provide

and the one in Belk was damag-
ed last year and had to be re-
placed; the one in Cannon has
been there for about four years.

There will be a room in the
new addition to the College
Union which will have an as-
sortment of vending machines
in it and will be open around
the clock.

“I don’t believe the boys tear
up the machines to any great
degree, nor do I believe that the
present situation is causing un-
due hardship on the students.
Telephones are e necessity, but

more time for study.”

The general attitude of the
sophomore students seems to be
more favorable to the second-

year than to the first-year pro- ,

gram. One said he feels the ma-
terial is more interesting and
the scheduling more reasonable.
Dr. Dan Rhodes, chairman of
the first-year staff, expressed
general satisfaction with the
freshman program as a whole:
“We don’t think we have all the
answers yet, and we're willing
to change, though we believe
that the overall pattern is good.”
Theme writing is also a ma-
jor change in the first-year
program. Twelve themes are
required first semester, and
the term paper has been elim-
inated. Second semester term
papers will be written on
topies from both semesters.

“Several considerations are
responsible for this change,”
said Rhodes. ‘“‘We are not sure
that the freshmen are prepared
to write a good term paper dur-
ing their first semester. Also,
basic library material for good
papers is limited, and because
of this limitation and necessary
time limitations, the number of
students writing on a particular
subject had to be limited last
year.

“Last year’s Humanities pro-
gram, being the first, was ex-
perimental and we believe that
there is value in continuing sev-
eral kinds of experiments,”
stated Rhodes. Dr. George Lab-
ban will lead one discussion an
entire semester, while students
in the other five groups will
change professors at mid-semes-
ter. Next term, Labban will take
a new group.

‘The change here is minor,”
related Rhodes, “but we want
to see whether or not they
make any difference. Dr. Lab-
ban will have the authority to
set review dates and require
papers ef times other than
those conformed to by the
rest of the group. Also, he will
make out his own reviews
while the other professors will
use @ common review. We
want to see if students profit
more from having the same
professor for a semester and

ed.
An innovation this year is the
placing of an iron and ironing
board in each of the dorms ex-
cept Duke. The items are avail-
able from the janitor while he is
on duty. Mrs. Moore has provid-
ed them on a trial basis to see
if the students want to use them.
Mrs. Moore uttered her stand-
ard plea for the care of all of
these conveniences: ‘Realising
that this is home at present, 1
try to make it comfortable. I
would appreciate each boy doing
his share in keeping up these
things. We must remember that
there are so meny more conven
ieness now than ever before.”

whether each professor mek-
ing out tests would have any
significance on grades.”

Many students have pointed
out faults in the Humanities pro-.
gram, although they seem to be
outweighed in the majority opin-
ion by the assets of the program.

“Many of the reading assign-
ments are unreasonably long
and dull,” commented one
anonymous student, “and sev-
eral questions on the exams
last year seemed entirely ir-
relevant. The professors don’t
seem to make alowance for the
fact that Humanities students
do have other courses that need
attention.”

In addition many students
have complained of the neces-
sity of buying $58 worth of
paperbacks for the sophomore
course. Dick Hicks commented,
“This is too much of a financial
burden for the student. The col-
lege should have bought some
of them and put them in the 1i-
brary reserve room.”

Student Directory
Coming This Month

Bigger print, better arrange-
ment and greater accuracy will
mark this year's student direc-
tory, according to Keith Mce-
Mullen, president of Alpha Phi
Omega, service fraternity. The
directory will be distributed
this month throughout the stud-
ent body.

APO, affiliated with the Boy
Scouts of America, has publish-
ed a directory the past two
years,

Last year the YMCA gave
APO responsibility for a pro
gram of recreation for young
children in Cornelius. McMullen
called the project “our big gun”
for this semester. Details of the
program have not yet been re-
leased.

APO's render other services
each year. They usher for pro-
grams in the Artist Series and
guide campus tours for visiting
groups or prospective students.
They assist infirmary patients
by bringing them mail and
books and provide a babysitting
service.

The Davidson chapter was
chartered in the spring of
1962. At present there are 30
members and five pledges.

president and rush chairman,

ter. He advises interested
students to contact him end to
