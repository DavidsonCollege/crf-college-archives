Aleohol Problem Here Indicates

NOT JUST DAVIDSON

Common Campus Plight: Limited
Guidance, Counseling Services

By JOHN BOLINGER

Asst. Managing Editor
Many colleges and universities similar to Davidson
possess limited or inadequate student guidance pro-
grams. Their counseling programs are particularly
weak in the treatment of students’ personal problems.
College challenges and pressures today’s student,
often resulting in depression, discontent and general
unhappiness. Many colleges now recognize the problem

____of the “troubled student” as a serious and growing one.

A recent psychological study estimated that up to 25
per cent of today’s college students could do better
work and be more happy with professional counseling.

Yet even with more stu-
dents needing and seeking
help only about 100 colleges
across the country have even
part-time psychiatrists or pro-
fessional guidance counselors.
Even fewer schools can of-
fer counseling in organized
guidance offices or campus
clinics.

At many colleges that do
provide psychiatric cdre, the
student is often faced with a
“don't need help after 5 p.m.
or on weekends" situation. .

Lack Of Motivation And Concern

chology.

By KIRK REED

“Davidson gentlemen do
not have alcohol problems.”’
At least this is what we like
to believe about ourselves.
“Sure. we drink. to le. off
steam. On dates we drink
just to have something to
do. But in neither case does
alcohol become an unhealthy
or dangerous crutch.”

Unfortunately, I do not
know whether to accept or
reject this rosy description.
Most students’ drinking pat-
terns do seern to be ‘‘normal
and healthy.’ But contradic-
tory evidence .is fairly abun-
dant. A hall counselor, for
example. says point-blank:
“IT know some guys who get
drunk four times a week.
Several boys are developing
real alcohol problems.”

Or to use the words of the
Aev. Will Terry: ‘Too many
students at Davidson drink
not to be convivial at a party
or to enjoy it as some enjoy
punch or coffee or coke—
they drink to get stone drunk.
Further, ‘too many students

‘consider the success of the
evening or the weekend to
be measured by how drunk
they get.”

Since I have no statistics
or carefully gathered empir-
ical data (no one has ever
bothered: to investigate our
drinking patterns through
controlled psychological re-
search). it is impossible to
draw firm conclusions about
the nature or extent of alco-
hol problems at Davidson.

I will merely assume that

Anxiety Reduced
With Assistance

ED. NOTE: The author is a Davisdon student describing

his problems.

But you my doctor my enthusiast,

were better than Christ;

you promised me another world

to tell me who
I was.

—Anne Sexton

Why does anyone go to a psvchiatrist? 1 guess that
that it’s a very simple question to answer.

When your world falls apart or starts to fall
apart, you really have no choice. Together you-and the
psychiatrist try to put back the pieces, not in the same
order, but in a different order that you, as the patient,

can live with.

The procedure, it's not very complicated really.
You go for an hour, in my case once every. two months,
not too often, and you sit and talk. It’s really just a talk

fess‘on, and vou can tell
the psychiatrist anything
you’re thinking about at
the moment, problems,
yes.

In my case I was too bound
up in myself. The work.
schoolwork, was oppressive—
that wasn’t by any means the
whole problem, no. It was
deeper because my emotions
were out of joint. I don’t know
really, it's sort of hard to ex-
plain.

I had a very great fear of
the future. I felt a loss of
fnnocence. I resented the ap-
proaching responsibilities. re-
sponsibilities not here so
much, of school, but outside,
snctal responsibilities. Of go-
ing out, of leaving home. for
good really, irrevocably, of
getting a “ob, all of that, I
could see no clear cut future.
and it was frightening to me.
Nothing was really assured
anymore. There were too
many decisions, and no real
answers.

And all of this, frustration,
yes, I was frustrated. I was
not happy with the sort of life
I was leading because I was
sure that there was more to

{

living than simply plugging
along day after day. doing
the same things. the same
sort of dippy things. And my
world simply started to fall
apart because I didn't know
where I was or where I was
going.

All of this anxiety mani-
fested itself in some physical
symptoms. I just didn't feel
well. Psychosomatic, com-
pletely — it hit me in the
guts, as I turned my hostili-
ties inward. And that's part
of the treatment. treating or-
ganic symptoms of inward
problems. I now have some
tranquilizers that I take
sometimes, whenever I feel
that things are closing in.
They chemically restore your
sense of self-perspective.

Now that my own therapy
has’ proeressed, I don't feel
the need to take the tranqui-

lizres as often. I feel that. I'm

a happier person. I caught
myself in time, with some
help, yes, certainly that. I do
give therapy a credit because
if I had been able to do this
myself, I wouldn't have need-
ed any therapy.

some Davidson students —
perhaps many—are becoming
problem drinkers. (Dr. W.
G. Workman assures me, in-
cidentally, that it is impos-
sible to predict which college
students will eventually be
alcoholics. The heaviest col-
lege drinkers may become
‘moderates’ or ‘‘tee-total-
rs“ may become alcohol-
ics.) And I will outline four
of Davidson's ‘‘drinking
problems,” as I see them.

(1) Students frequently use
alcohol as an escape from
scholastic, social and person-
al tensions, Too many men
go to Hattie’s during the
week, not just to have a beer
up the road with the boys.
but to forget. The problem.
then, is not necessarily with
drinking per se. Drinking
can be merely a symptom of
a deeper, more basic prob.
fem —the unwillingness to
face up to and work.through
one's troubles.

Psychologists say that the
most dangerous time for a
person to drink is when he
is depressed. The alleviation
‘of the depression tends to re-
inforce the drinking behavi-
or to such an extent that
heavy drinking may become
a deeply ingrained “habit,”
relied upon in any ‘‘prob-
lem situation... The moral
seems to be: “Drink when
you're happy, not when you
are sad.”

(2) In a broader sense,
drinking can be a symptom
of a generalized lack of mo-

tivation, a generalized disin-

terest ‘in academic work.
This seems to be a wide-
spread phenomenon at Da-
vidson. One freshman hall
counselor reports, for exam.
ple, that 23 per cent of the
boys on his hall are ‘be.
boppers.””

The “be-bop group” spends
most of its time listening to
records and shooting the
Breeze. Often they bounce on.
up to Hattie’s‘ (on one occa-
sion a group even went up
the road at 7:30 a.m.), but
the drinking again is only a
tiny aspect of a much more
comprehensive motivational
problem.

(3) I am told that several
of the students who drink ex-
cessively are products of an
extremely puritanical home
situation. When one consid-
ers that a relatively large
percentage of Southern Bap-
tists are alcoholics and that
Europeans (who tend to drink
in moderation from child-
hood) have little trouble with
alcoholism then this obser-
vation about family back-
grounds does not seem sur-
prising.

Once again 1 am speaking
conjecturally. but if a casual
relation could be demonstrat-
ed here (i.e.. between mak-
ing alcohol a “big issue” —
treating it as an “absolute
evil’ — and drinking exces-
sively), then there might be
immediate implications with
regard to Davidson's strict,
overly protective, in loco pa-
rentis philosophy.”

(4) A final problem is that
many Davidson students do
not seem to care about what

happens to their fellow stu-
dents. When we see a fellow
student drinking irresponsib-
ly. what do we do? Uusually,
nothing. Will Terry says this
quite well: ‘‘I wish that we
could establish the kind of
climate among. students
where irresponsible drinking
was not favored, that when
men started destroying the
dorm property because they
had hit it too much at Hat-
tie’s or acted like a fool at
parties they could feel the
subtle disapproval of their
peer group, but I suspect
that is tco much to ask of
the Davidson intelligentsia.”

I am afraid that -Will’s pes.
simism is well-founded. But
it is not too much to ask that
psychological research. be
undertaken to determine the
nature and extent of David-
son's ‘drinking problem" (it
is disgusting to hear people
talk about a problem when
their discussion is not

grounded in empirical knowl- ,

edge). And who knows. Our
“drinking problem’’ may be
illusory. When the CRAP Re.
port is approved, we may

surprise everyone by proving |

ourselves to be mature and
responsible gentlemen.

versity in Lexington. Va. is
typical of most guidance pro-
grams. Although W & L of-
fers an extensive vocational
guidance program, the school
does not have a_ personal
problems guidance center or
a full-time clinical psycholo-
gist. according to the dean of
students at the university.
Student counseling 1s limited
to the dean of students, the
assistant dean of students,
and a faculty adviser.

At Furman = University,
where a recent student sui-
cide sparked a renewed in-
terest and concern in the area
of professional guidance. a
clinical psychologist is em-
ployed but not on a systema-
tic or full-time basis. Dean of
Students E. E. Harrell said
that the clinical . psycholo-
gist is restricted in the hours
that she can be of service
since she is also a member of
the faculty with a regular
course load.

Amherst College faces a
similar problem. Although a
professional counselor is on
the college staff. his course
load allows him to spend only
20 hours a week with the stu-
dents as a professional coun-
selor.

One college that does have
an organized counseling cen-
ter with a resident psychia-
it trist is Dickinson College in
Carlisle, Penn. The center
comes in direct contact with
six to eight per cent of the

_ student body each year and

handles a wide variety of per-
sonal problems from home-
sickness to serious psycholo-
gical difficulties.

Although most all colleges
and universities possess limit-
ed counseling facilities, more
extensive professional guid-
ance with full-time clinical
psychologist or psychiatrist
is needed. In the words of
Dean Harrell, “‘The need. for
‘better guidance programs is
here and it’s time to do
something about it.”

Not All Academic Pressure
Bad, Counselor Hight Says

By DAVID SWEATT
Managing Editor

“You have to look at~ the
‘why’ of academic pressure *
said Dr. William B. Hight.

“And the sympathy-seeker
will never tell you the whole
story.”

Davidson's director of stu-
dent counseling refused to
call all pressure bad. Instead
he asserted that from a posi-
tive point of view pressure
can serve the student rather
than hurting him.

‘We have to learn to make
pressure work for us,’ he
said.

Hight said one thing that
had not been considered ful-
ly in recent talks about in-
creased student freedom is
the increased pressure which
accompanies new freedoms.

Hight described pressure
as resulting from one of two
sources, intrinsic and extrin-
sic. He suggested that the
new curriculum next year
would offer many students
the’ opportunity ‘to place
themselves under self-impos-
ed intrinsic pressure.

This would be in sharp
contrast to the present -sys-
tem, which exerts academic
pressure of an extrinsic na-
ture, that of formal assign-

Campus Drug Problem

‘Nonexistent’ At Davidson

By PAUL SCHNEIDER
Syatt Writer

Student use of drugs does
not seem to be a problem at
Davidson.

At least that is the opinion
of a number of several mem-
bers of the college commun-
ity, from students to admin-
istration. They agreed this
week that drug use on cam-
pus has been practically non-
existent this year.

One student said, ‘I know
for a fact that there has been
marijuana on campus in
rooms. ‘All of this was last
year and as far as I know

none of the people who used
it before are now using it.”

Dr. James B. Woods, cam-
pus physician, said that as
far as the infirmary was
concerned, drug use was not
a problem.

The proposed. student Code
of Responsibility has a sec.
tion barring the illegal use
of drugs by any students.
Before the code was present
ed by the CRAP Committee
there was no official rule
either in faculty or student
regulations regarding the use
of drugs.”

Dean of students Richard

C. Burts Jr. expressed con-
cern that there had been no
footing for the position of the
college, but said that. “With
the anticipated adoption of
the code we will have a def-
inite framework in which to
act.”

“My information is retro-
active," he said, “but the
general trend is that we do
not have a drug problem.
There has becn some use on
campus in the past but not
enough to come to the sur-
face, nor the kind of situa.
tion in which we have had to
take action.”

ments and lectures.

Hight cautioned that not
all students were equipped
to direct themselves in their
studies, that some would do
their best work only in a
conventional course situation.

Asked if the purpose of
some courses at Davidson
was to teach character by
having the students do large
quantities of work with no
apparent scholastic value,
Hight said that courses at
Davidson aren't or shouldn't
incorporate hurdles erected
just for the value of jumping
them.

Speaking’ of Davidson stu-
dents in general, Hight said
most. graduate from high
school as ‘18-year-old suc-
cess stories.’ ‘Bright boys
who learned everything in
high school except self-dis-
cipline,"’ Hight described the
Davidson freshman.

Many times the high-pres
sured situation is too much
for the problem solving abil-
ities he developed in high
school. Hight said. Problems
after this point are most se-
rious for those who with-
draw from the situation. he
added.

The healthiest reaction for
a student who experiences
academic problems is to see
the professor. What most stu-
dents fail to understand, ac.
cording to Hight, is that see-
ing the professor helps as a
tension reducer.

Sometimes a student may
generalize fear of a course
to the person of the profes-
sor, Hight said, giving the
student a great psychological
barrier to improvement in
the course.

Hight characterized profes-
sors as falling into two cate.
gories: those who are inter-
ested only in their academic
discipline and those who bal.
ance their academic inter-
ests with a strong interest in
their students.

Davidson professors fall
into the second category, ac-
cording to Hight. ‘‘They
wouldn't be here If they
weren't interested in stu.
dents. That’s why it’s so
foolish for students not to
see a professor when they're
having a problem in a
course.”

On the question of grades,
Hight said he felt that they
were necessary in scholar-
ship just as standards were
necessary in all other sectors
of the modern society.

Hight said that grades of-
fer the best single indication
of how a student will do on
the next level.

Hight said that pass-fail
grading would suit him but
that he didn’t think students
would like being judged for
graduate school admission
solely on the basis of the
Graduate .Record Examina-
tion, Law Boards, and oth-
er’ nationally - administered
standardized tests.

“Students come to David.
son willingly, fully aware
that Davidson is tough,”’ he
said. ‘‘Surely they aren't sur-
prised when they find that a
lot is expected of them."

College
May Get

Adviser

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

There is a good: possibility
that Davidson will obtain the
services of one or more clin-
ical psychologists at some
time in the near. future, ac-
cording to Dr. W. G. Work.
man, professor of psychology
and chairman of a recently
formed Committee on Coun-
seling and Guidance.

“The need for more help
in the area of student coun-
seling has long been recog-
nized at Davidson,” said
Workman, “but this is the
first organized effort to rem-
edy the problem that I can
remember.”

The committee, which in.
cludes several members of
the administration and fac-
ulty and two students, has
been working on the prob-
lem since the beginning of
this semester. They have
discussed the problem at
length but have not yet
reached definite conclusions.

They have been aided by
the visit of Dr. Ben Barger
professor of psychology and
director of student counsel-
ing at the University of Flor.
ida, who consulted with the
committee early last month.

Barger made a careful
study of the situation here
and entertained questions
from the committee. He has
recently made several rec-
ommendations to the com-
mittee based on his observa-
tions.

“The committee has not
yet met to consider Dr. Bar.
ger's suggestions," Workman
said. ‘‘so I cannot say what
the nert step will be.’

Approval for the addition
of a clinical psychologist has
already. been given by the
Board of Trustees. The rec-
ommendation for obtaining
such a man was a part of
the Blue Sky recommenda-
tions and the Davidson Col.
lege Self-Study Report, which
preceded them.
