Computers upgraded
all around campus

By Mary CLARE JALONICK
Executive Editor

In addition to the new “Stu-
dent Computing Center,” facelifts
have been given to the library, the
24 hour computer lab in basement
Chambers, and the computer class-
rooms in Chambers.

All of the Macintoshes in
Chambers classroom were re-
placed, and the old computers were
moved to 24 hour lab and the li-
brary.

The library now has five
Macintoshes and five Windows
machines. The 24 hour lab now
has six Macintoshes, all newer than
the machines that were previously
there.

After being approached by the
Student Government Association,
computer services has also addeda
laser printer to the Basement Cham-
bers facility.

However, Lydia Lorenzin,
Coordinator of Academic Facili-
ties and Services, says that they are
worried about the security of the
laser printer.

What we need is card access,”
she says. Computer staff are hop-
ing that this will be installed within
the semester.

The hours for the classroom
on the 3rd floor of Chambers will
be extended to close at 1 a.m.

Lorenzin cites the student sur-
vey that was distributed last spring
as a major factor in deciding what
changes to make.

It really helped us,” she says.
“T wish that more people had taken
it, but it was good to be able to take
student opinion into account.”

The work is not all finished,
however.

“We still have a lot of work to
do,” says Lorenzin, “but we have
had a tremendous summer.”

New recycling program will |
challenge campus commitment

By KirsTEN RECKNAGEL

Davidson College introduces
a new test this year which will be
taken by every member of the stu-
dent body as well as faculty and
staff. Acing this test won’t result
in a high GPA, but it will save the
school a lot of money and will do
the environment some good.

Abandoning the recycling pro-
gram which has existed for the past
several years, Davidson will enter
into a new and more lucrative re-
cycling solution.

“Everybody will have access
to two garbage cans: one for wet
waste and one for recyclables,”
explained Associate Professor of
Economics David Martin.

If the campus succeeds in
keeping wet waste, which includes

glass, restroom waste, food and

materials contaminated by food or
liquids, separated from recyclables
such as aluminum, plastic, all pa-
per and cardboards when dispos-

ing of these materials, Davidson
will have the opportunity to see
“tremendous savings,” said Tony
Owens, Building Services Man-
ager.

The school now pays $31 for
each ton of garbage it hauls to the
landfill. Rather than joining non-
recyclable waste in.a landfill, this
fall the entire contents of “recy-
clable” bins will be hauled to Fulton
County Recycling (FCR) in Char-
lotte.

There FCR will sort and sell
the jumble of recyclables and send
any garbage mixed in with these
materials to the landfill.

Davidson will be billed the
usual $31 per ton disposal fee for
this garbage.

Not only can Davidson save
money on the large arnount of its
recyclable waste that FCR accepts
atno disposal charge, but the school
might actually receive money back
for the materials it sends to FCR.

‘If the rate of contamination is

low — that is, if very little wet
waste products are thrown into des-
ignated recyclable bins — “FCR
will figure their earnings on [the
recyclable material] and will split
them with us,” said Owens.

Under the new program, which
Martin and Owens helped arrange
this summer, a majority of
Davidson’s trash will be recycled
— free of the $31 per ton disposal
cost.

“FCR will be monitoring each
and every dumpster” Davidson
sends them, said Martin. Therecy-
cling company will tolerate only a
certain percentage of contamina-
tion. ;

Student Recycling Commit-
tee coordinators Seth Clippard, a
senior, and sophomore Meredith
Judy will work with Martin and
Owens .

They hope to educate the cam-
pus about the program in the hope
that Davidson will meet its recy-

cling challenge.

Parking prices soar to new heights

To the two thirds of Davidson
students who kept cars on campus
last year, the benefits of personal
transportation outweighed
Davidson’s $60 vehicle registra-

price tag leapt to $80 over the
summer.

Has the Public Safety/Police
Office received many complaints
from students as they shelled out
33% more to keep their cars on
campus? . “Only a couple,” said
Ray Thrower, Director of Public
Safety/Police.

According to Thrower, vehicle

general account and do not consti-
tute part of the Campus Police bud-
get. The decision to raise registra-
tion costs, he added, was handed
down from the college’s vice presi-
dents. The Davidsonian was un-
able to contact Vice President of
Business and Finance Robert
Norfleet for information as to why
the fee was raised.

All students who intend to park
their vehicles on campus this year
must attach registration stickers to
the front and rear windshields of
their cars by Monday, August 26
or face parking violation fines.

Thrower said that “none of the
parking fines have gone up.” The
prices of these fines, he said, are
controlled by the Public Safety
Department.

Parking unregistered cars on
campus carries a fine of $30. After
multiple offenses the car may be
towed. Vehicles parked in fire
lanes, visitor spots at any time or in
employee spaces after 5 a.m. will
be towed by Archers Wrecker Ser-
vice on South Main Street.

Thrower said that students are
now allowed to park in faculty
spaces during specified hours “to
try to get students closer to the
buildings at night.”

Those who wish to avoid the
$80 registration fee may park in
the Baker Sports Complex lot or in’
the far half of satellite parking.
