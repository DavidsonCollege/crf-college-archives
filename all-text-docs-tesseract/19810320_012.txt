Dalglish, Larsen create musical fantasies

“Inside Dalglish are springs
and streams with fish flash-
ing..:Inside Larsen are the side-
long glances of the sun in late
afternoon...When the two play
together the world they create is
a fantasy.

These enthusiastic words of
critic Ruth Seligman describe
Malcolm Dalglish and Greg

Larsen, the superb duo who will
give a hammer dulcimer concert
in the 900 Room tonight at 9:30.

Dalglish makes his own dul-
cimers. The dulcimer, a reso-
nant, stringed box, is believed
to be one of the oldest stringed
instruments known.

Larsen plays a variety of
instruments. including piano,

Burke talks on Burkology

Kenneth Burke, who at 83 is
the only remaining founder of
the New Criticism in American
literature, will visit Davidson
next week.

As early as 1941 W.H. Auden
called Burke ‘‘unquestionably
the most brilliant and sugges-
tive critic now writing in Amer-
ica.”” William Carlos Williams
praised Burke in a poem.

In addition to his work in
literary criticism, Burke has
published a novel, numerous
stories and poems, and a num-

ber of books, including Lang-
uage as Symbolic Action and
Attitudes toward History. The
idiosyncrasies of some of his
work have earned it the classifi-
cation of ‘“‘Burkology.”

Burke will speak about ‘‘Two
Eschatologies?’’ at the Open
Luncheon Wednesday at 12:30
in the 900 Room. Then at 7 that
night he will discuss ‘‘The
Philosophy of Literary Form”
at the Center for Special
Studies.
