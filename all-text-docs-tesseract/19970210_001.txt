Last Sunday at approximately
11 a.m., sophomore Jason Koyasu
and his friend Daniel Roberts were
killed in a head-on collision with a
mini-truck near Spanish Fork Can-
yon, Utah. Roberts was driving on
the snowpacked road when the car
slid into the opposite lane.

The two former schoolmates

from St. Mary's International School
in Tokyo were heading to Ann Ar-
bor, Michigan as part of atrip around
the U. S. before Koyasu went back
to Japan for a semester. Roberts
was a student in New Mexico.

“In Japan, we spent so much
time studying to get into college
that we didn’t get a chance to travel
around,” says junior Steve Hsieh,
who also went to St. Mary’s in
Tokyo.

Life science buitding
breaks new ground

Campus officials, member of
the Board of Trustees, and friends
of the College gathered in front of
the Dana Life Science Building on
Thursday for the groundbreaking
ceremony of the Watson Life Sci-
ence Building.

Drs. Frances and Lenox Baker,
Jr., Craig Wall, Jr., Dr. Richard
Brubaker, Carolyn Watson, and
President John Kuykendall were in
the first group to break ground, kick-
ing off the construction’ that will
begin in early March.

Wall, Chairman of the Board
of Trustees, told the gathering, “In
my twenty years on the Board, no
campus event has been more im-
portant than the construction of this
building.” :

Co-chair of the Life Sciences.

Project Brubaker, commented,
“We’ ve got great students and great
professors, but they just haven’t
had a great place to sit down... now
they do.”

Watson will house both the bi-
ology and psychology departments
in orderto promote interdepartmen-
tal cooperation in fields such as

animal behavior and neuroscience.

Senior Bill Abrams said, “I’ve
spent a lot of time in the neuro-
science lab, and it’s a tight ship
down there. The new building will
be wonderful. More students will
be exposed to intensive biomedical
research.”

‘Professor of Biology John
Williamson said, “It will be a major
boom to teaching undergraduate
research. Of course, it’s ten years
too late for an old guy like me.”

Watson will be connected by
covered bridges to the Dana Build-
ing and face the main campus.

Together they will make up
what will be called the Baker-Watt
Science Complex, named: for Dr.
Lenox Baker and Dr. James Watt.

Their respective son and daugh-
ter, Drs. Frances and Lenox Baker,

Jr., contributed $2.5 million to the —

project in their honor.

Watson will bear the name of
Wayne and Carolyn Watson, par-
ents of 1982 graduate Bryna
Watson, who also gave generously
to the project.

$9.25 million of the $12 mil-
lion project has been raised so far
for the new 32,000 square foot struc-
ture.

On Saturday at 10:30 a.m., a
memorial service was held for
Koyasu in Lingle Chapel.

“T sent only one message to
Japan that spread out-to all of my
high school. I think about 20 stu-
dents from all over the U.S. are
coming down because they can’t go
to Jason’s funeral service in Japan,”
says Hsieh.

Chaplain Rob Spach organized
the service whichincluded Koyasu’s

host father Carl Sorenson, Dean of
International Students Ruth Pittard,
and several of Koyasu’s friends.
“It captured the essence of who
he was as a person and as a friend
while at the same time demonstrat-
ing that Jason was a great guy,” says
sophomore Yu-jay Harris.
Koyasu was an Assistant
Teacher for the Japanese depart-
ment and a member of several cho-
ral groups. He intended to major in

mathematics.

Koyasu is survived by two
brothers, ages 9 and 16, and par-
ents. “He was very proud of what
he had come from and excited about
being able to share that here,” says
Pittard.

Down-the-hill soon will be
on the upside of internet-access

Some students clamoring for
dorm room Pollux access may only
have to wait until late March to plug
in and log on from the comfort of
their own rooms.

“Our goal [of wiring Knox,
Irwin, and Akers dormitories] is
mid to late March,” says John

Reunites" Residential Networking”

Supervisor.

Reuning stresses however, that
dorm wiring is only one aspect of
the College Administration’s “Net-
work Master Plan.” Currently, he
says, this project involves “rewir-
ing the entire campus, and dorms
are part of that.”

“The entire project will take
time,” Reuning says. He adds that
wiring is expected to be completed
by Fall 1998.

When wiring work is com-

pleted in Knox, Irwin, and Akers
dormitories later this spring, dorm
residents will be able to access a
web browser such as Netscape, an
FTP utility enabling users to down-
load files from a server, and Telnet,
which allows users to connect to
Pollux, Little, and Chal.
Currently, anumber of students

use modems to connect to such ser- -

vices from their rooms or off cam-

purchase a license foreach machine
running a specific application.
Currently, the College Admin-
istration is meeting with potential
contractors and working with an
engineering firm to develop net-
work hardware specifications.
- The deadline for contractors to
submit bids for the project is Febru-
ary 17 and within a week of that

deadline, says Reuning, the project’s

However, once wiring is com-
pleted, connection will be possible
when users plug their computer into
the data connections mounted on
the wall in their rooms.

Dorm wiring will not provide
access to such applications as
WordPerfect, Word, QuattroPro, or
other applications available on com-
puters maintained by the Computer
Services Center.

In order to offer these pro-
grams, the College would have to

supplies are ordered, construction
will begin.

Of the master networking
project, Reuning says “Plans are
nearing the end of the draft process.
I think once construction starts on
this project, it will move fairly
quickly.”

A 1995 Davidson graduate,
Reuning says his role in'the net-
working project “will involve more
interaction with the students and
less actual network construction.”
