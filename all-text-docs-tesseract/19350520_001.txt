first honors in the competitive drill con-
test Monday, followed closely by Com-
pany D, commanded by Cadet Captain,

a large number of spectators, was pro-
nounced a great success by local R. O.
T. C. officials and by Captain Thomas
Brand, the judge Capt. Brand .was the
inspector at the unit’s inspection a few
weeks ago.

Praise was practically given to the
commanders of the two leading Com-
panies for the way in, which they han-
dled their companies on the field. Capt.
Brand declared the judging very diffi-
cult and Major Rhett expressed himself
as being proud of the entire battalion.

The newly elected Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil members have already started to work
on securing bigger and better dances for
Davidson. ‘Their plans for «next year,
have been submitted to the nine social
fraternities, and are beginning to ma-
térialize.

The plan which will secure the best
orchestra available for the Davidson
Mid-winter dance, depends entirely upon
the co-operation of the student body.
With their co-operation, it will be pos-
sible for the council to obtain one of
America’s leading orchestra, and really
secure “big-time” dancing for the col-
lege, stated “Cokey” Branton, president
of the new Pan-Hellenic Council.

The plan is that all students wishing
to attend the mid-winter dances shall
pay one dollar a month from September
to January which will amount to five
dollars in all. If at the end of this time
the student finds he will be unable to
attend the dance he will not lose any
money because the tickets are transfer-
able. The lack of co-operation by the
student body from the first will only

make the tickets higher because the
council: is detérmined to have the best
possible dances at Davidson, and is going
to secure one of America’s leading or-
chestras which will make tickets higher

unless all cooperate.

Council To Extend
’33 Rushing Period

1935 Rushing Season Deferred
Two Days And Extended To
Nine Days

The Pan-Hellenic council announces
the new regulations regarding the-rush-
ing season for the coming year. Despite
the long attempted hope for a longer
period for rushing, the time has only
been lengthened two days The season
will begin on September 12th and con-
tinue through the 21st.

The season just past allowed only
seven days of active rushing but the
coming season will allow nine. Each

fraternity will be allowed nine functions
Which may be had in any form desired,
The council has also allowed two days
after begins before the acutal
rushing will begin.

The period of silence will begin on
Friday, Sept. 20th, at 10 o'clock and end
at Saturday, 9 o'clock. At this time the
rushes will do their pledging. |

It was formerly decided that there
would be only five formal days in the
rushing season, but after consideration
the time was lengthened to nine formal
days.

This is an extension of two days over
that of last year, but is still not as long
as many people wished. for. Several
