Part IV: Philosophy Of Going Coed

The main features of the pro-
posed plan were devised to pro-
vide for coeducation at this par-
ticular college in the most ad-
vamtageous way, and to meet
the expectations and preferences
of those groups having a direct
imterest in the college's future.

We decided to press for the
beginning of coeducation on a
significant scale in the autumn
of 1972 because we feel that the
matter is of some urgency.

The AED Report, submitted
just over two years ago, recom.
mended that Davidson become
coeducational at the earliest
possible date. The matter of co-
education seems to us to be of
greater importance now than it
was then.

The trend which the AED
foresaw of men’s colleges be-
coming coeducational has, we
suspect, pleced Davideon in a
tess favorable position in re-
crulting students.

We need to ensure that out-
standing studenis continue to be
attracted to Davidson. We also
need to provide the best pos-
sible educatioral environment
for those who are already here.

If--as the Study Commission
and AED Reports predict—co-
education will bring clear bene-
fits to this campus, then we
wish as many as possible of the
Present student body to enjoy
them.

The first group of women stu-
dents is envisioned as substan-
tial in numbers. This is in line
with the recommendations of
Officials ai several of the col-
leges which have recently be-
came coeducational.

The problem of adjustment for
women on formerly § alt-male
campuses seems to be eased
when there is a considerable
number of women involved.

Admittin a sizable group of
upperclassnjen first will also,
we feel, make the adjustment
easier for freshmen women in
the following year.

Freshmen women will have
the help and advice of upper-
élass women who have already
become accustomed to the aca-
demic and social life a: David-
son.

Although the plan calls for a

beginning to coeducation on a
Significant scale next autumn,
it does not require a drastic ex-
pansion of the student body at
Davidson.

In the first year there would
be 100 women students on cam-
pus; in the fifth year there
would be 300. In the first year
the total student enrollment
would be 1100; in the fifth year
it would be 1300.

Only in the tenth year would
the enrollment reach 1500. We
feel that this is a moderate ex-
pansion, and is consistent with
the long-range planning already
in progress at the college.

It should also be noted that
this plan of becoming coedu-
cational through expanding the
enrollment is basically the plan
favored by the Study Commis-
sion and AED Reports and given
first preference by all the
groups—faculty, administrative
s'aff, students, and alumni —
whose op:nions we surveyed.

We believe that this plan is
not only the best one for David-
son College. but that it is prac-
tical from a financial point of
view.

Part V: BBG Finance Report

The members of the subcom-
mittee of the Budget, Buildings
and Grounds Committee to
study the economic feasibilizy
of. coeducation submit the fol-
lwwing report resulting from its
Study.

In making cost estimates we
have followed largely the plan
for implementat.on of coedu-
cation as outlined in ithe repoit
of the subcommittee ca coedu-
cation of the Educational Policy
Committee. A schedule showing
the results of our cost estimates
on an annual basis for a 10-
year petiod appears below.

in order to arrive at cost esti-
mates the following assumpt-

total of 200 women is antici-
pated.

A limited number of additional
personnel will be needed sub-
sequent to the third year dur-
ing the period of expanding en-
rollment.

The basis used for increases
in other operating costs was the
budgeted figures for the 1971-
72 year,

With regard to endowment
funds, which should be added,
this subcommittee feels that as
a minimum the endowment in-
come produced for the current
fund budget should be the same
per student (approximately

$675) and is currently avail-
able.

year period to general endow-
ment funds.

In addition to general endow-
meut funds, there should be en-
dJowment funds for scholarships
raised over the same nine-year
period to produce énough in-
come to meet the increased
scholarship requirements. This
amcunts to approximately $5,-
400,000.

The total goal, therefore, for
increases to the endowment
funds should be $12,550,000 or
approximately $1,400,000 per
year. The Development Office
feels that this goal is not un-
realistic.

The capital requirements for
expansion of facilities (dormitor-

To begin with, there would be
virtually no additional expense
involved in the first year of co-
education beyond the salary of
the woman administrator added
to the college staff.

Over against this there would
be a considerable increase in
the amount of income through
student tuition and fees. The
problem of housing additional
students in the first year with-
out additional facilities may
look more acute than it is.

The attraction of off-campus
housing is.such that the problem
recently has been to keep the
dormitories full.

If as many as one hundred
women transfer students are en-
rolled for mext year and some
men students are forced to share
three-man rooms, there is some
reason to think that at least
some of this overcrowding will
disappear over the first several
months of the year with the cus-
tomary student attrition.

It is partly because we can-
not foresee any financial prob-
lem with the first year of co-
education that we urge that the
college begin coeducation next
autumn,

Overcrowding in the second
year of coeducation will be a
serious problem, but it will be
temporary if the building of
additional housing facilities can
he started in the near future.

The expenses of coeducation
in the following years can, we
believe, be met by financial
planning and fund-raising with-
out imposing undue strain on
the college. :

Dormitories can be built with
government loans which are
self-amortizing. Student tuition
and fees will largely or entirely
cover increased operating ex-
penses.

This is possible partly be-
cause a minimum increase is
called for in administrative
staff, and only a modest in-
crease in the number of facul-

some increase in the student-
faculty ratio (from 11:1 to 13:1)
should not suggest that we are
willing to see a diminution in
the quality of the college’s edu-
cational program.

In our opinion the number of
women students foreseen here
can be successfully absorbed
without sacrificing educational
quality if faculty members are
added to those departments
where they are most needed.

We find that it has been the
common experience of colleges
of Davidson’s type that the
student-faculty ratio rises slight-
ly with expansion and the ad-
mission of women students.

Such a rise was foreseen at
Davidson by the Study Com-
mission on Coedication.

Even though the mave to co-
education will, we believe, be
economical, the opportunity
should not be lost to raise ca-
pital funds to meet the needs of
the college in the years ahead.

We note that a drive is cur-
rently in progress, which will
help to endow scholarships and
faculty salaries.

But the advent of coeducation
and the beginning of an era
of expansion mark an appro-
priate time for a special drive
to raise funds.

We think such a drive is more
likely to succeed if the college
is already committed to coedu-
cation and expansion and is pro-
ceeding to implement its plans.

There is overwhelming senti-
ment in favor of coeducation at
Davidson and remarkable un-
animity about the major features
to be incorporated in the plans
for achieving it.

We feel that the spring of
1972 is the time for the college
to make a definite commitment
to coeducation according to a
firm timetable and with a clear
idea of long-range objectives in
this area.

hope that it will provide some
