In ‘reference to the popular music
which is continually being thrown upon
the market we say that we prefer songs
without words rather than songs without
sense.

“Fm going to get a divorce. My
wife hasn't spoken to me for six months.”

“Better be careful. You'll never get
another wife like that.”—Boston ‘Tran-
script.

Their lips did move in sweet accord
Although no words could come—
Their feelings were too much for words,
For they both chewed chewing gum.

DO VE NOW,

“Tf you've got a job to do,

Do it now!
If it's one you wish were thru,

Do it tiow!
If you're sure the job's your own,
Don't ham and haw and groan—

Do it now!
Don't put off a bit of work,

Do it now!
It. doesn’t pay to shirk,
Do it now!
If you want to fill a place
And be useful to the race,
Just get up and take a brace— ;
Do it now!
Don’t linger by the way. :
Do it now!
You'll lose if you delay,
Do it now!

Af the other fellows wait.

Or postpone until it’s late,
You hit up a faster pait—
Do it now !"

others, but not to the extent of overlook-
ing its faults, He stated that we do not
know enough about the other nations of
the world. ‘Phe two million soldiers
who went to France will feel that Fu-
