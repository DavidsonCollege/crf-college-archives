The ,..Martin Chemistry
building’ contains rooms which
do not meet federal safety
regulations, according to Direc-
tor of the Physical Plant Grover
C. Meetze Jr.

“The Martin building which
was first occupied in 1940, has
labs that do not have necessary
exhaust hoods. Acids and reac-
tive chemi are stored in
rooms that were not built for
that purpose,”’ said Chemistry
Department Chairman
Nicholas Burnett.

“There is no question that we
are deficient in these areas,’”’ he
said. Burnett added that the
space in the Martin building is
inefficiently used. The building
contains classrooms with pipes
running across ceilings, poor
lighting, ‘and inadequate
acoustics.

All colleges and companies
today are in some way violating
federal safety laws, according
to Meetze.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. indicated that he
did not know of any federal
safety requirements that had
not been met in the chemistry
building

If the worn out, poorly ventilated building cannot be renovated,

“We ought to look into it right
away,’’ Spencer said.

On February 2, 1973, Burnett
submitted a report to Spencer
which cited the problems of
poorly ventilated and worn-out
labs. Burnett: has guided Spen-

cer through the Martin
building, pointing out its
deficiencies.

The problems involved in
renovating Martin or in con-
structing a new chemistry
building are not new ones. Bur-
nett and Meetze have been oc-
cupied with them for six years.

“Nobody has worked harder
than I to get a new or renovated
chemistry building over the
past few years. All my
drawings will vouch for that,”
said Meetze.

‘“‘We have made a strong ef-
fort to increase safety by
requiring safety glasses, in-
stalling eyewashes, safety
showers, and fireproof blan-
kets,’’ said Burnett.

‘We have had two inspections
by our insurance people. We
have passed both inspections,”
remarked Meetze.

The report submitted to Spen-
cer on February 2, 1973, by Bur-
nett stated, ‘“We have spent the
last four years studying the
possible ways to improve the

Stored chemicals, as well as students and faculty, suffer from the overcrowded conditions of the Martin

renovation of the Martin
building, or by construction of a
new building.

“In my opinion, additional
time and effort devoted _ to
deliberations on the questions
would not be productive.

“Frankly, we have reached a
point of diminishing return. The
time for a clear decision is at
hand.”’

renovate the Martin building
for use by the chemistry depart-
ment,’’ remarked Burnett.

Meetze argued that the
building situation should be re-
evaluated in light of the present
economic considerations.

The administration applied
for a Seely G. Mudd Foundation
grant and for National Science
Foundation money. Both ap-
plications were rejected.

“‘One of the main problems in
solving the Chemistry building
dilemma is that the Davidson
administration has never fully
committed itself to getting a
inew or renovated chemistry
building. Until we get this com-
‘mitment, I am not optimistic.

“Our hopes were raised a
couple of years ago, but nothing
happened. We spent a great
deal of time and effort in
working out a report and little
has been done,” Burnett stated.

Spencer said that he would
not make; the chemistry con-
struction his number one major
building priority.

‘We are considering. three or
four projects. Chemistry is one

of our top priority needs; -

however, a new fine arts
facility, field house, and ad-
ditional housing are also under

“IT have appointed a goals
committee who will try to iden-
tify all things the college would
like to have by 1987. We will
arrange resource needs on a
priority basis, and we will for-
mulate ways to get these
buildings and resources.

“The committee will have
representatives from among
the trustees, the faculty, the
student body and the staff. I ex-
pect the report of the committee
to be out by May,” said Spen-
cer.

‘‘Whether we decide on
building one structure versus
another will depend largely on
fund raising. We will try to iden-
tify potential sources of money
and approach these sources
with our plans,”’ added Spencer.

“There are a sizable number
of potential donors available. I
think we have some very good
selling points, and can compete
favorably with .other _in-
stitutions also seeking funds,”
stated the new Vice-President

for Development Craven’
Williams.
“The Mudd Foundation is still

very much a possible source of
funds. We will have to re-
establish our communication
with them. A
