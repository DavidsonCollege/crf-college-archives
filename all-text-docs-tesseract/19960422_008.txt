Every Easter at Davidson
Jesus’ death and resurrection is
remembered. Yet as the events of
the past couple of years clearly
indicate, thoughts of Christ’s death
and subsequentresurrection are not
the only thoughts that the Easter
holiday triggers in the minds of
Davidson students. In the past
couple of years, there has been a
growing aggravation among many
Davidson students concerning the
perceived forceful disposition of
Christians on this campus. Conse-
quently, individuals with strong
convictions on these issues have
decided that they need to voice
their opinion.

Last week, in the course of the
Student Government Association’s
weekly meeting, Intervarsity Chris-
tian Fellowship came under attack
for an apparent failure to comply
with the SGA’s criteria for charter
renewal. As an organization whose
stated purpose is “to share with the

Bo Bartholomew and Adam Gess

iversity undermined

Board of Trustees, the Faculty, and
the Administration the responsi-
bility for developing and main-
taining Davidson as a superior aca-
demic community,” the SGA is
itself a representative of Davidson
College, and is obligated to uphold
the stated policies of the college.
Thus, the SGA has decided to take
issue with Intervarsity’s require-
ments for leadership which it ar-
gues do not comply with the
college’s nondiscrimination
policy, particularly as it applies to
the discrimination of homosexu-
als. The proposed action—deny
Intervarsity’s request for a charter
renewal.

I am not writing to give my
proposed solution to this particular
problem, but I would like to bring
up a point that needs to be consid-
ered. Davidson prides itself upon
its commitment to diversity and
open-mindedness. Thecrosses that
were put up outside of Chambers

the week before Easter appear to
some to be powerful symbols from
a close-minded group that is at-
tempting to force its opinions on
others. Indeed, the crosses do rep-
resent the very heart of the Chris-
tian faith. If it were not for the
resurrection of Jesus Christ the
Christian faith would represent
nothing (thus, the importance of

the cross as a symbol of the Chris- ,

tian faith). Yet what] fail to under-
stand is why the cross and Chris-
tians in general have been singled
out as a group that is attempting to
indoctrinate this campus.
In my four years hear at
Davidson, I have witnessed a pas-
sionate cry being made for justice
in the name of diversity. Over the
same four years I have also wit-
nessed a growing number of ef-
forts to silence the voice of Chris-
tianity on this campus, and I find
these two objectives hypocritical.
If the Christian voice was silenced,

would diversity truly be diverse?
It shows an alarming lack of sin-
cerity, I believe, to rebuke the
crosses when groups suchas FLAG
— not an organization opposing
Christians, but a separate voice —
are permitted to display portraits
of nude figures in the Union, or
their pink triangle flag in the li-
brary, all in the name of diversity.

As for the action awaiting a
vote by the SGA concerning the
IVCF charter, I believe it is time
that we face up to our hypocrisy. If
the SGA does indeed decide to
revoke the IVCF charter, it will
ultimately undermine this college’s
commitment to diversity.
Intervarsity’ s leadership qualifica-
tions concerning homosexuals are
based upon a genuine and sincere
religious conviction.

There is no hatred invlved
(homosexuals are in fact allowed
to become members and are en-
couraged to join in the group’s

activities), and their position is one
that can be backed by logical and
rational arguments. By revoking
the IVCF charter on the grounds
that its leadership qualifications
discriminate against homosexuals,
the SGA will merely be attempting
to deal with an issue of discrimina-
tion by creating another issue of
discrimination, as it will be differ-
entiating IVCF from its other char-
ter organizations on the basis of a
religious conviction.
As a result, the message it will
send is that we here at Davidson
College are willing to replace one
form of discrimination with an-
other so long as it conforms to
socially tolerable norms. Thus, if
this is diversity, I want no part of it.
This is a very difficult issue to
deal with, I admit, and I do not
propose to have all the answers.
However, I do feel it is important
that we carefully consider our ac-
tions.

Religion, ideology,
and hypocrisy |

In Germany they came first for the
Communists, and I didn't speak up
because I wasn't a Communist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I
didn't speak up because I wasn't a
Jew. then they came for the trade
unionists, and I didn't speak up
because I wasn't a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Catholics,
and I didn't speak up because I was
a Protestant. Then they came for
me, and by that time there was no
one left to speak up. — Martin

Note that IVCF’s require-
ments do not violate the member-
ship conditions of chartered orga-
nizations; anyone can be a mem-
ber. They only limit their leader-
ship to people who hold the same
religious views, including the non-
practice of non-marital sex. There
is no condition governing leader-
ship in chartered organizations.
Although there is no precedent for
it, members of the SGA may at-
tempt to apply the membership

require them to allow someone who
does not hold their religious beliefs
to lead their organization, and to
force them to do so would be taking
away their right as a religious orga-
nization to determine their own
beliefs. It is also allowed by law.
Religious organizations are consti-
tutionally guaranteed the right to
discriminate in such matters. If the
SGA does not renew IVCF’s char-
ter, it will be a sad case of adecision
which is not based upon the law of

This is not

oppresion by

mosexuals (or
heterosexuals who are having sex
outside of marriage) to be leaders.
It does, however, allow them to be
members. That is to say, anyone
can come to IVCF and be a mem-
ber, but only people who fit a cer-
tain set of criteria can assume lead-
ership positions in IVCF.

This is ideologically distaste-
ful to some members of the SGA,
who claim that this violates the
conditions governing whether or
not a group can be chartered. In

clause to leadership. Even if they
do, however, they have no grounds
for not re-chartering IVCF.

The clause allows for dis-
crimination when appropriate and
when allowed by law. -IVCF’s
constitution is based on their reli-
gious convictions and a widely
held interpretation of Scripture —
which the Presbyterian Church
(USA) also holds — which disal-
lows practicing homosexuals from
filling leadership positions.

It seems, therefore, appropri-
ate that they can discriminate be-
cause their discrimination is based
upon a lifestyle disallowed by their
religion. It would be absurd to

Although this decision. may
seem benign or perhaps noble, it
will be an unlawful exercise of the
government's power. Religious lib-
erty lies at the foundation of a free
society, and we must not stand by
and let the student government rob
us of this vital right. —

In an institution that seeks to
harbor and encourage diversity,
such a decision would be highly
problematic, ideologically hypo-
critical, a gross violation of our
rallying cry for diversity, and a
threat to the free expression of reli-
gion.

Potty training

Most students on campus need not worry about cooking, washing,
orcleaning. Davidson provides these services for us, so we may study,
work, volunteer, and create without the interruptions.of normal life.
Unfortunately, many of us take theseprivileges for granted, especially

Once a week, I walk into my hall’s bathroom and cringe with
embarrassment upon noticing it has just been cleaned. How empty it
looks without the week’s various sports sections scattered under the
stalls and toilet paper stuck to the floor. I become embarrassed when
I picture Mary facing this disaster while we sit obliviously in class. In}
fact, I become embarrassed for most of our school’s population when
I realize another spoiled student has abandoned the residue of anight’s
drinking beside the toilet for her to clean.

Such actions are weak, inconsiderate, and unacceptable for any

Expression

Here at Davidson, there has
been a-lot of talk recently about
freedom of expression. People see
certain types of expression as of-
fensive and feel that those who

choose to share their beliefs are

imposing on the campus commu-
nity. People feel violated and
threatened by controversial dis-
plays. This should not happen at
an institution which claims to strive
for diversity and foster the growth
of enlightened minds.

Instead of being viewed in a
negative way, the expression of
diverse beliefs should be taken asa
constant reminder of our personal
freedom and as an opportunity to
strengthen our beliefs. Each time
someone on campus expresses an
opinion, he or she is actively sup-
porting the constitution and the
very ideal of freedom. Likewise,
each time someone is witness to
the expression of another’s ideas,

he or she is given an incredible
opportunity to test their own be-
liefs and to build a strong founda-
tion upon. which to base further
learning. From personal experi-
ence, I can say that those ideas
which are born amidst severe op-
position are prized much more
highly than those which exist
merely because they remain un-
challenged.

If we do not wish to take ad-
vantage of the amazing wealth of
beliefs at Davidson, why do we
strive for a diverse student body
and faculty? Likewise, if we choose
to be offended rather than seek to
strengthen our minds, how can we
support the idea that we have come
here to learn?

If we really do want diversity,
and if we really are here to learn,
then we will cherish the sharing of
diverse ideas rather than shun
others’s rights.
