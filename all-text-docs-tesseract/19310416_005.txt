THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 16, 1931

The Ben Greet Players

On Saturday afternoon and evening, April
11, the world-famous Ben Greet and the
Ben Greet Players appeared at the Armory
Auditorium in Charlotte, presenting “Twelfth
Night” (or What You Will) at the matinee
hour, and the “Tragedy of Macbeth” at the
evening performance at 8:30. Sponsored by
the Charlotte Drama League, these two
Shakespearian plays were pronounced suc-
cesses, as ev inced by the gratifying attend-
ance, both at the matinee and evening per-
formances.

“Twelfth Nght,” the matinee hour pres-
entation, was lauded by many as a superb
performance. Although not as dramatic as
“Macbeth,” its lightness, jollity, and humor

The presentation of was a dis-

the fact that Malcolm and Donalbain, played
by Walters and Gillespie, seemed a bit weak
in the portrayal of their roles, the play as a
whole showed wonderful talent,
and assidious preparation.

Ben Greet,
played three minor parts, again demonstrated
his wonderful ability as an actor, notably in
the role of the Porter, and the rendition of
the famous Porter Scene. Reginald Jarman,
as Macduff, and Russell Thorndike, as Mac-
beth, were the outstanding performers of
the production. Muriel Hutchinson, as Lady
Macbeth, also showed wonderful capabilities
as an actress.

Somewhat difficult to follow than
the matinee performance, but offset by excel-
lent lighting effects and a dramatic atmos-
phere, augmented by subdued lights and col-
orful hangings, “Macbeth” brought back all
the thrill and all the delight ever afforded
in time past, by the plays of Shakespeare.

He itterpreted his poems with all the pas-
sion and physical expression, accompanied by
many idiosyncrasies, of an actor or a grand
opera singer. In a poem interpreting eastern
music, Mr. Lindsay called upon the audience
to chant the verse with him. Two of his se-
lections, The Chipmunk, and Crows, illustrat-
ed clearly the poet's point that words and

recruits for his job in the Far East. Seven
of the graduating class of Ely came up after
that meeting to’ give their lives to the hard-

Marshall closed his talk with the thought
that there is such a perfect peace and realm
of happiness in a complete resignation to
God’s will; and he urged that if anyone
thought himself fit for such a life to accept
the challenge by all means, because “the ban-
ner is still leading on—calling us to follow.”

“The object of a liberal arts college is to |
teach the students to be something; that of

something,” Dr. Hopkins continued. “The
only thing the liberal arts college can do is

Predominance of Youth

Discussed ed by Durant

Durant, Peateesor a at Columbia, Be-
lieves ‘Modern Youth on Verge of
Puritanical Revolution

Cleveland, Ohio—(IP)—The reign of
youth in the world today is about due to end
in a puritanical revolution, Dr. Will Durant,
author of books on philosophy and kindred
subjects and former professor of philosophy
at Columbia University, said recently in an
interview here.

“The predominance of youth in modern
affairs,” he said, “is due partly to the large
unsettled population caused by late marriages
and partly to the fact that most of the news-
paper writers and reviewers are young peo-
ple:

“Youth has been holding an epicurean riot
in our big cities; but like all things, they
run themselves out in time. The new clothes
may be an indication of the trend. Perhaps

Eumenean
The Eumenean Literary Society set a
precedent Monday night when several of its
members journeyed to Winthrop College, at
Rock Hill, S. C., and presented a program

to the three literary organizations of the
large Palmetto institution, in a joint meeting
in Johnson Hall.

Calvin Kuykendall presided at the meeting,
after being introduced by Miss Elizabeth
Hopke, Winthrop master of ceremonies. Jim
Ward and Dave Murphy took charge of the
opening exercises after which Jack Matthews
gave a talk on Eumenean traditions. This
was followed by an address on travel, given
by Gaither Jenkins. Waddell ‘Williams con-
cluded the program with an extremely hu-
morous talk. Every speech proved effective
and was well received. Norman Raies acted
as critic for the evening.
