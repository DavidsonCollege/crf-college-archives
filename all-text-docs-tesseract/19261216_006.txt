YULETIDE COMES

(Continued from page 1) |
Santa Claus is comin’! Fairies may fade |
away until their vapory forms are lost in
the elements whence they sprang into being.
The stern’ realities of man’s republic devas-
tate the old monarchial splendor of child- |
hood’s resplendent and colorful kingdom. |
But an eternal pinch of wistful yearning |
hides himself in some crevice of the human }
mind even as it shakes off the glories of an
imaginative, yet ephemeral, past.

Sober men romp as children. With unre-
strained and_unashamed vigor they select the
evergreen tree, the red-berried holly, the
amorous mistletoe. The home brightens with |
new life. The family spirit flames into new
significance. From the erstwhile materialistic
shop to the hitherto materialistic home come
precious treasures that would be but baubles
in midsummer. The green breath of fresh
nature glows venerated and admired—the
token of life in a wintry world.

are cherished God’s evergreen gifts, |
Natural beauty enters the home and arti- |
ficial attempts at beauty pall before it.

Christmas—good old Christmas !—opens
the floodgate of men’s harts and the spirit of |
youth pops out. Jolly St. Nick is real—and
with him from his traditional home in the |
snows comes a sweeping avalanche, an un- |
bridled host, or beneficent spirits. God's |
love flows from man to mani, lightening the
heart and uplifting the spirit. With each
gift goes the giver. Fraternal love prevails; |
the sorely racked world is at peace. |

Be not ashamed of this generous impulse.
Revel in the spirit of the season! Reach out
with your whole self and back in the warmth |
of Christmas. Visit the shops. Marvel at|
the color. Thrill to the brisk air of loving |
anxiety. Open your heart and free your own |
good spirits.

All the world praises God: with loving |
praise on this one day attd through this one |
season—Christmas. Draw up your memories
of the gaily bedecked evergreen, the holly
wreath, the green and the red of the bright
festoons, the sparkling glint of the tinsle
spangles, ‘the beanring surprise of the unre-
strained circle searching amid the treasures
set down by the season’s saint for their share
of the booty. Smell the pungent plum pud-
ding, the savory roast turkey, the multitudi-
nous assortment of fruit.

Fill yourself to the brim with the joy and
gladness of the season; that you may perceive
and feel the glow of life that spiritualizes
the bright display and renders the twinkle of
the tinsel sincere. Santa Claus is real! His
sleighbells are already ringing so near that
the merry tinkle falls upon our waiting ears
and sets vibrating our holiday spirit.

Merry Christmas to all! Let the thrill of

“Since 1808
The Home of Good Shoes”

The students of Davidson College re-
sponded to the appeal of the “Y” and
contributed over eight hundred dollars
to the Hangchow fund. Twelve mem-
bers of the faculty gave over a hundred
dollars bringing the total to over nine
hundred dollars, and with some more
reports to come in, the campaign leaders
are certain that the full amount will be
raised. |

Watts Dormitory answered the call,
with a contribution of nearly one hun-
dred and seventy-five dollars. East and
West Dormitories came close behind with |
one hundred and sixty apiece. The’
smaller buildings totaled around one
hundred dollars apiece. |

The campaign has been in charge of
the Y Cabinet with J. F Pinkney as cam-'
paign leader. Dormitory leaders were
appointed with instructions to see every
man in their respective buildings. These
dormitory captains were Joe Frierson, W.
L. Lingle, Bob Link, G. Batte, Charles
McRae, and: Boyce Martin.
