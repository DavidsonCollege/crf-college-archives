As arms talks resumed in Geneva this
week, the Soviet Union offered a new

some promising elements, the Reagan
Administration denounced the major
tenets as unequal and unverifiable; the
Administration refuses to scrap the “Star
Wars” program stating that evidence in-
dicates the Soviets have been developing
an SDI of their own. Meanwhile, in an ef-
fort to garner NATO support for his pro-
posal, Gorbachov made a four-day visit
to France to discuss the possibility of a
separate arms agreement between the two
countries; French President Mitterrand
rejected the offer.

areas will be allowed to admit blacks and
more beaches in Cape Town and Durban
are to be integrated. In the U.S., Secret-

expedite an ease to the racial tension by
releasing Nelson Mandela and agreeing

Scarcity of spaces frustrates student drivers

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Recent security measures to
reduce illegal parking on campus
have prompted students to comp-
lain that the current Davidson
parking lot situation is not up to
par with student needs.

“I have received up to $40 in
tickets for parking on the grass
{near Irwin Dormitory],” junior
Dennis Nutter said. “I have had to
park there because I cannot find
any other place to park.”

Junior Gary Branch echoed
these sentiments: “Sunday night, I
came back to campus and looked
for a space and could not find one,
so I parked in the laundry lot. At}
a.m. I remembered that I had my
car in the laundry lot and would
receive a ticket if I left it there, sol
drove the car around looking for a
space. I could not find a space on
Patterson Court, in the Belk park-
ing lot, or in the lot by the
R.O.T.C. [rappelting] tower. Sol
gave up looking for a spot and
parked on the grass by Sentelle.
The next morning I received a $10
ticket. I was a little upset about
it.”

Is there a real parking problem
at Davidson? Campus Security
Chief Jackie Hughes investigated
the Davidson parking situation
and filed a report with Director of
Facilities Planning Grover

Meetze. Hughes’ report indicates
that at present 586 students have
registered their car for the 1985-
86 year. The campus contains 71! !
parking spaces, 224 of which are
reserved for faculty and staff.
Thus, 487 campus spaces have
been designated as student park-
ing.
However, Hughes added that
“these figures do not include park-

ing for perimeter houses.” If
perimeter parking figures are
added in, the total comes to
roughly 546 student parking
spaces in and around the campus.
Thus the campus would need at
least 40 more student parking
spaces to equal the number of cars
presently registered. According to
Hughes at least fifty more student
cars will be registered before the
end of the school year.

“For the students, there’s a
parking problem only on the prin-
ciple that everyone is going to
have to walk,” Chief Hughes said.
“Students want to park in close to
their dorms. But the trustees want
a ‘walking’ campus.”

Meetze commented that he
has received no complaints about
parking from students this year.
The parking — situation, said
Meetze, is basically the same as it
was last year, when “there was es-
sentially no problem. Maybe the
(current) problem lies in where
students want to park. However, I
am not opposed to continuing to
study the problem.”

“Right now we should be
close to having enough spaces for
students,” Hughes said. “But very
few students park in the the Fine

” Arts lot [on Main Street next to the

Copeland Gallery}. Until the stu-
dents use the lots and:fill them up,
I don’t see us building any more
parking lots.”

The Fine Arts parking lot,
however, has had several security
problems in the past. Two years
ago, a 1969 Chevelle belonging to
Senior Russ West was stolen off
the lot. “The car was locked,” said
West. “About 10:00 at night,
someone broke into the car and

hotwired it and drove it away. The
police waited until the moming to
report it, and by that time [the
thief] could have been all the way
to Texas. I have never gotten the
car back.” It has also been re-
ported that at least one other inci-
dent has occurred in that lot.

Meetze said that as of right
now, no plans are being made for
the construction of additional
parking space. He added that any
future addition would occur as an
extension of the new lot next to the
rappeling tower. “We have
worked to take parking from the
interior of the campus to the
perimeter, and that is where we
are going,” he said. “I’m not anti-
parking, but I want to make sure
that we have the best environment
for the students. I want us to be
second to none as far as that
goes.”

“Parking has been a perennial
problem on this campus,” Dean of
Students Will Terry said. “I can
never remember a time when
somebody didn’t complain about
parking.”

“However,” he added, “stu-
dents used not to bring as many
cars to campus as they do today.
Families were not as affluent and
there weren't aS many cars
around.”

Approximately twenty years
ago, freshmen were not allowed to
have cars on campus, and this pol-
icy helped to alleviate the parking
problem somewhat. However, “a
federal anti-discrimination law
changed this rule,” Hughes said.
“Students could no longer be dis-
criminated against on the basis of

age

Until five years ago, a parking

lot of approximately 100 spaces
lay behind Duke and Sentelle dor-
mitories. However, for “beautifi-
cation” purposes, this lot was
bulldozed and removed, and a
new student lot was built to the
northwest of Patterson Court.

At present several ideas be-
sides construction of a new lot
have been suggested for alleviat-
ing the parking problem.

First, it has been suggested
that parking privileges could be
reserved exclusively for up-
perclassmen. “Though my inter-
est is unrelated to parking,” stated
English Professor John Engell,
“I'm in favor of not allowing
freshmen to have cars on campus.
At a large number of schools,
freshmen are not allowed cars.
One reason is because during your
college years, you should have the
opportunity to be concerned with
things not necessarily directly re-
lated to the hurly-burly of our so-
ciety. You should be isolated from
some of the constraints that wast-
ing your time [such as maintaining
a car) put on you.”

However, Dean Terry said,
“We're certainly not going to ban
cars from freshmen if I can help
it.”

Second, students could be
charged for parking permits.
“We're the only college in North
Carolina that does not charge for
parking permits,” Hughes said.
UNCC charges an initial fee of
$32 for parking permits, while
UNC-Chapel Hill charges $78.

Third, a certain grade point
average could be required for a
student to maintain a car on cam-
pus. Students who did not meet a
minimum G.P.A. requirement

would be refused parking
privilege until their G.P.A. was
raised sufficiently. Dean Terry
commented that this requirement
would be “treating students as
children.”

Fourth, security could be in-
creased in the Fine Arts lot, which
is classified by campus security as
lega! student parking. “Students
need to feel that wherever they
park, they can feel secure parking
there,” Dean Terry said.

Dean Terry added, ‘We have
to be more realistic that there
needs to be some flexibility for
students parking for lunch or sup-
per on [Patterson] Court.” How-
ever, Hughes objected to allowing
students to park on Patterson
Court, calling it a““danger because
the street is not wide enough.”
Hughes said that when the SAE‘s
started a fire at Knox Dorm last
year, the fire trucks could not
move in to put it out because stu-
dents had illegally parked on the
Court. “If the fire had been any
more hazardous, this really could
have caused a big problem.“

Current parking regulations
state that “during nighttime and
weekend hours, any person may
legally park in any designated
parking area. Vehicles parked il-
legally may be ticketed any time.”
Ticket charges range from $5 fine
for non-registration of vehicle.
$10 fine for illegal and improper
parking, toa $25 fine for improper
parking in a handicapped area or
for driving across a_ brick
sidewalk. Regulations state that
“appeals for unjust tickets may be
made to the Public Safety Office
and must be made within three
weeks of alleged violations.”
