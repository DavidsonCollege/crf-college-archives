“You've been making love to those college
girls,” said the girl who was left at home.
| “What makes you think so?” asked Archie
Ray.

“You've improved so much,” said she.

The shades of night were falling fast,
When for a kiss he asked her.
She must have answered, “Yes,"—because
The shades came down still faster.

The efficient local police arrested a man
the other day and hailed him into court.

“What's he charged with?” growled the
judge.

“Well, he looks suspicious,” said the offi-
leer, “He was trying to sell garters to the
Davidson boys.”

“Case dismissed,” quoth his Honor, “He
is evidently insane.”

Fresh Bordeaux is inclined to indulge in
heterogeneous, coneatenacious, bombastic dic-
tion. He say's that a kiss is the “anatomical
juxtaposition of the orbicularisoris in’ the
state of contraction,”

Speaking further of kisses, he submits the
following original poem for our approval:

Though girls kiss cach other,
I don’t see how they do it,
For without a real he-man
There sure ain't nothing to it,

All this sounds very true, but we would
just like to inquire where he earned this.
Any information along this line would be
greatly appreciated.

Beecher, whose mother died when the son
was only three years of age, was permeated
throughout by the power left to him by the
memory of his mother.”

The speaker told of a personal experience
in his life, when he at the age of 21, was
tempted to commit a chimeful act, but the
thought and picture of his mother called him
back and he fled from the segne. Later he
told his mother of the incident, and she teld
him it was at that very time that she spent
one hour in prayer for him,
