ATLANTA — Sophomore Jen

and nine
; assists to
Wildcats 90] lead the
Ga.Tech 72/ ' h e
women’s
basketball
team to a 90-72 victory s Wednesday
night over Georgia Tech.

The win over the ACC school was
the biggest in the history of Davidson

women’s basketball.

“Tcan’tsay how proud of this team
I am,” said senior Danielle Mall, who
along with classmates Jennie
Vanlerberghe and Jennifer Sanborn saw
Davidson finish 4-23 her freshman year.

“Four years ago, our coaches were
afraid to play Georgia Tech because we
would have been demolished. To beat
them now means so much.”

The Wildcats hit 55.6 percent from
the field, 50 percent from three-point
land, and 23 of their 27 foul shots.

‘Davidson was behind for almost
the entire first half until Kerry Brown

scored on a layup with 3:04 remaining
in the half.

The Wildcats led at the half 38-35,
and didn’t look back as they kept the
lead the entire second half. Davidson
took control of the game with a 20-7 run
in the final minutes.

Joining O’Brien in double figures

- forthe Wildcats were Vanlerberghe(17),

Jessica Montrella (14), and Jamie Brown
(10).

The first trey cut the Davidson lead

six-point lead, 58-52.

“He (O’ Kelley) showed tonight that
he can get the job done,” Wake Forest
coach Dave Odom said. “He really
helps take the pressure off of Jerry
(Braswell) and Tony (Rutland).”

And while O’Kelley’s play lifted
Wake, it was the poise and experience
of those senior guards that Davidson
lacked down the stretch.

“The experience and poise of
Rutland and Braswell was a real factor,”
McKillop said. “The experience of a
team that has made seven straight NCAA

Wildcats.

O'Brien was a terror this
week, on the hardwood, leading
the Wildcats to three wins. The

26 points Wednesday against

MVP honors in this weekend's

at Belk Arena.

it’s biggest lead of the evening.

But ultimately, the Wildcats’ in-
ability to put the ball in the basket —
they shot only 35 percent from the field
— caught up with them.

“During the time we shut them
down, if we had made one shot, maybe
it could have put the dagger in them,”
said Davidson coach Bob McKillop.

Enter Robert O’Kelley.

The freshman phenom scored 10
of his 18 points in the last six minutes,

were Landry Kosmalski and Stephen
Marshall, who recorded 11 and 10, re-
spectively.

For Davidson, it was another val-
iant effort against a top echelon pro-
gram.

But it was a game the Wildcats let
slip away.

“There is no consolation in losing
a game like this,” McKillop said. “We
don’t feel this is a moral victory. We
lost, and that’s emptiness.”

utes in the Belk Arena press

“This was a game we could’ ve

“That’s emptiness. There’s no conso-
lation in losing this game by five or six
points.”

nated much of the second half.

Thanks to the best stretch of de-
fense by the Wildcats so far this sea-
