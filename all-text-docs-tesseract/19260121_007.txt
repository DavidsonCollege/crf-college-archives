Volunteers Study
. Foreign Missions

The Volunteer Band met Sunday morn-
ing at ten o'clock, as usual. John Brad-
ley read a letter from China, describing
conditions there, telling about the war,
and showing the need of more mission-
aries in that field.

At the meeting held January the toth
the band voted to undertake a program ,
of intensive study of the various foreign
mission fields. It was decided that they
should be studied in relation to their
need of missionaries in the following or-
der: Africa, Japan, China, Mexico, Bra-
zil, Barts Rico and India. Each member
Was given a special phase of each field to
study and report on. In this way it is
hoped that the urgent need of mission-
aries in the various fields will be put
forcibly before the Davidson volunteers.

The North Carolina Confederation of
Volunteers forthe Foreign. Mission Fields
will hold a conference at the North Car-
olina College for Women at Greensboro
between the 26th and 28th of February.

A\n interesting program has been planned |

for the occasion. student in the
college is cordially invited to attend. All
the volunteers are urged to go, for we
are sure that the conference will prove to
be of great help to them in the prepara-
tion of their life work.

it is high time to wake out of sleep.” From
this verse he chose as the theme of his talk:
“What is the greatest need of a college man
today?” He said that “this s one of the
great problems that confront every college
man, and one that he should solve early in
his college life. It has to be met, so we must
wake out of our sleep before it is too late,
and we have drifted through our college
days, not having found a purpose in life.”

“When Christ chose His disciples, He did
not go to the city and choose the lawyers and
doctors there.
shore, and chose men of great physical
strength. Christ had a good physique Him-
self. He organized them into the greatest
organization that the world has ever known.
But strength is not the greatest need of a
college man today:

“We may look at the need from another
angle. Let us consider knowledge. It is a
fine thing to make high marks, and the
world recognizes wel trained men. They ex-
pect college men to he leaders. But this
isn't the greatest need. How about popu-

larity? Boys try to see who can be the most
popular, Ty Cobb, the most popular man in
baseball, says that he wished he could do

something else besides play ball, for he did
not feel that he had bettered the world when
he has finished this life. Jim Thorpe, the
greatest of Indian athletes, played a game
of football the other day before only 300
spectators. His popularity is gone. It is
here today and gone tomorrow. We must
build our foundation stronger.

“Our great need is to find what God's
purpose is for us in life. We must do cer-
tain things to find that purpose. First, we
must meet God's approval, by doing God's
will, and keeping in close communion with
Him. His love brings happiness. Second,
we must be humble, forgetting haughty pride.
Chist did not have a haughty spirit. A sure
sign of success is the man who is willing to
be humble. Third, we must be visual. Some-
times we drift along through college in a

Professor Vowles mentioned that when

the congregation he is often tempted to

Kindliness he will exert a greater influ-

were, that of seeking financial gainof be-

Captain Weems has expressed himself as

to both Captain Weems and his assistants.
All the cadet officers put forth their best
efforts in preparation for the recent inspec-

by the members of the battalion, contributed
largely to the splendid showing made by the
unit.

During Colonel Rowell’s visit he was the
guest of Captain Weems and was entertained
at dinners or luncheons by Dr. and Mrs.
Martin, Captain and Mrs. Daughterity, Cap-
