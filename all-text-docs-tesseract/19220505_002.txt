Ralph Flowers, of Sumter, S. C., stands

out as the. greatest half-back ever dev-

eloped by Bill Fetzer, In the cage game
he was a great forward and he played
two seasons on the baseball team. After
two years at Davidson “Buck” went to

Georgia Tech and for three years played

half on the Golden Tornado.

Five feet eight inches tall and tipping
the beam‘at a bare 140 pounds, Buck was
fast, nervy, and heady, and certainly de-
served an All-Southern berth. Walter
Camp mentioned him for All-American
honors. The Atlanta Constitution speak-
ing of his great work says: “Flowers,
the 17-year-old Davidson half-back, is
one of the South’s most brilliant foot-
ball players. Despite his light weight,
he is a fierce tackler, a good line smash-
er, a brilliant punter and broken-field
runner—all in all one of the best halves
the South has seen in many a day.

In the first game of the '17 season,
Ralph out-punted Roberts and Ingram of
Navy, ran riot through broken fields
and seizing the ball raced 70 yards
through the entire Navy team for a
touchdown. In the next game with the
ball on State’s 1-yard line the whistle
for the half blew and Flowers’ field goal
which should have been the margin of
victory was the only Davidson score.
State winning 7-3. Flowers was the
first man to score on the Golden Tor-
nado in 1917 and shares honor with King,
who crossed the Jackets’ goal line, the
last man to score on Tech. In the re-
maining games Buck was all there and
his work in the Auburn game wrecked
their hopes of a championship.

Ralph was a hard man to guard on the
hardwood and was one of the heaviest
