Davidson programs seek to make
minorities feel welcome, comfortable

By Mary C are JALONICK

When Junior Jose Ruiz was
applying to colleges, Davidson
didn’t stand out. “What Latino,” he
asks, “is going to come to an all-
white, Presbyterian college in rural
North Carolina?”

The Minority

Experience at
Davidson

But Davidson wanted him to
play football. “I was in to that,” he
says, “so I came.”

He says he is glad that he did.
“I wish there were more Latinos
here. And I wish that people were
more open- minded. But I’m gladI
came.”

Junior Wesley Hart says he
would recommend Davidson to
‘other African American students,
but only if they were fully aware of
the College’s negatives. “Youcan’t
be happy here unless you are will-
ing to accept the situation, or change
it.”

_ _ Assistant Dean of Students and

Director of Minority Student Af-
fairs Ernest Jeffries is in charge of
giving minority freshmen their first
impression of Davidson. To do
this, he leads a minority orientation
that takes place before freshmen
orientation.

The brochure for the program
states that it is “not a substitute for
freshman orientation, [but designed
to supplement it] by introducing
students to issues that are unique to
the experiences of African Ameri-
cans and Hispanic Americans at-
tending Davidson.”

The brochure also states that
pre-orientation has three goals.
First, it seeks to acclimate students
to college life. Second, the pro-
gram introduces minorities to cam-
_ pus resource persons. And third,
“[The program seeks to expose] stu-
dents to important concepts in En-
glish and science.”

Hart says that the program was
“a very good experience. It helps
you to build up a network of stu-
dents.”

He disagrees with those who
claim that the orientation is “sepa-
ratist.” ““Whatever separates people
is going to happen anyway. People
are going to go with people like
themselves. It’s not pre-orientation
[that is doing it],” Hart says.

Ruiz, who did not attend the:

pre-orientation because of football,
feels that the it definitely forms a
clique, but he understands why.
“The sheer numbers [of white stu-
dents] are intimidating,” he says.

Jeffries, who has been in his
position for a little over a year, says
he feels race relations are on the
upswing at Davidson. “The in-
crease in numbers in applicants tells
me that the College is getting our
name out there, and that potential
students are hearing it.”

However, Jeffries seems to feel
that there is a level of stagnancy
about the issue. “There doesn’t
seem to be a lot of concern. The
people that need to be at diversity
forums are not. Some people have
never really had to confront feel-
ings about the issues, and never
will.”

Hart agrees. “People are afraid
to step out of their comfort zones.”

Tene Moore, a counseling as-
sistant in Career Services, has been
at Davidson for six years. She feels
that relations are not really on the
upswing at all.

“T was on a committee once
with an alum who graduated in 1985.
He turned to me one day and said,
‘You know, these are the same is-
sues that we dealt with when I was

here.’ I don’t think that things have ©

really changed at all,” Moore says.

She says she is encouraged by
the increase in numbers, but isn’t
sure that relations will necessarily
improve.

“There needs to be more of an
effort to change things,” she says,
“more of an effort on the white
students part. They try and make
BSC more open, but that doesn’t
matter if no one comes.”

Part of Moore’s job in Career
Services is to lead the ACES pro-
gram. ACES, which stands for
Academic and Career Enrichment
for Students, “aspires to enhance
the educational and vocational ex-
periences of multicultural students
at Davidson College,” according
to the brochure.

Moore schedules dinners with
alumni and local professionals,
holds goal-setting workshops, or;
ganizes “life skills assessment”
seminars, and meets with students
informally. The program also
awards some students money to
work or travel over the summer.

Ruiz, whois receiving money
from ACES this summer, wishes

.that these programs were not so

focused on African Americans. “It
seems that when Davidson speaks
of minorities, itimmediately means
African Americans.”

He points out, however, that
this is because they are the major-
ity. “Often minority programs are

attended solely by African Ameri- ©

cans.

Both Moore and Ruiz feel this
is because African Americans
stand out more as minorities.
“People often consider Hispanic
Americans and Asian Americans
to be white,” Moore says.

Ruiz says that it is difficult to
program anything specific for all
minorities. “We are so diverse
within ourselves, so in turn our
own experiences are very differ-
ent.”

All of them say that they ex-
perience subtle racism every day
—teachers calling on them to give
the “black perspective,” overly
nice do-gooders, or complete ig-
norance on the part of the naive —
but all say that they have experi-
enced very little racism that is com-
pletely overt.

Much of the issue is chalked
up to the passive nature of many
Davidson students.

“We have to interact with
white people all of the time,” says
Hart. “Many white students don’t
ever have to interact with a black
student.”

Pedrina Burrero, co-founder
of the Committee of Widows, Or-
phans and Displaced Persons in
Rabinal, Guatemala, and Annie
Byrd, a member of Guatemala
Partners based in Washington,
D.C., visited the campus last Mon-
day to describe the violence and
destruction which occurred in
Guatemala during the 1980s.

As part of her visit, Burrero
gave a testimony in Spanish to a
group of students, faculty, and
community members in the 900
Room which recounted a series of
‘massacres that left 25% of
Rabinal’s population dead, includ-
ing her husband and two brothers.

Specifically, Burrero de-
scribed the September 15 massa-
cre which occurred in the market-
place in Rabinal where 800 people,
mostly men, were killed in one
hour by civil patrolmen and army
troops. To escape, she hid in a
store for the day, and exited to find
“widows, orphans, and displaced
people who couldn’t live as they
-had before.” Burrero recounted
how the army and patrolmen stole
property, including the people’s
cattle, and burned clothes and
houses, which forced the commu-
nity into the mountains for safety.

According to both Burrero and
Byrd, who served as Burrero’s
translator, the citizens of Rabinal
were civilians, with no association
with the guerilla movement fight-

Burrero fights. against
past, for future in Guatemala

ing against the government. The
violence used by the army “was
successful in stopping any type of
civilian organizing,” according to
Byrd, and in dividing the commu-
nity. “There are many people who
have left [Rabinal] and can’t go
back. They can’t afford it and
there are still threats and intimida-
tion,” said Burrero.

In an attempt to reconstruct |.
the divided community and “to say
all of the reality of what happened
in Guatemala,” Burrero co-
founded the Committee of Wid-
ows, Orphans and Displaced Per-
sons in 1995. In addition to bring-
ing forward the human rights vio-
lations which occurred in Rabinal,
the organization has petitioned the
Guatemalan government to ex-
hume the more than 75 clandestine
cemeteries around Rabinal and has
raised money to construct a me-
morial for those who were mur-
dered.

Burrero stated that the exhu-
mations are particularly important
“because the government has left
under the earth everything done to
the Mayan people.” She added,
“Tt’s easy to destroy in one mo-
ment, but to construct a new Gua-
temala is going to be a very diffi-
cult task.”

Burrero’s trip to the United
States is sponsored by Guatemala
Partners whose purpose is to pro- |:
vide “educational outreach in the
US and support grassroots organi-
zations in Guatemala,” according
to Byrd.

Cofer liberates power
through creative process

By ALLIson DoLPH
Staff Writer

Judith Ortiz Cofer, professor
and writer, spoke in the 900 Room
on Thursday.

Cofer is the author of The Latin
Deli, Silent Dancing ... The Line of
the Sun, and two other poetry col-
lections. The title of her talk was
“Women and the Creative Process:
Making Writing Happen.”

Cofer began her talk by read-
ing from her essay, “The Woman
Who Slept With One Eye Open.”
Her message was modeled on Vir-
ginia Wootf’s- description of the
“Angel in the House,” an overly
solicitous creature who threatens
the woman artist by giving every-
thing to others and nothing to her-
self.

Cofer’s essay unveiled a strik-
ing contrast between two antitheti-

cal creatures, her muse (Maria

Sevida) and her vampire (Maria
Laloca). These two women, whose
stories were told to her in the form
of “quentos” by her mother and
aunt, serve as a “germinal point” for
Cofer’s existence as a female writer
and a free woman.

Her vampire, Maria Laloca, is
a broken-hearted woman foresaken
at the altar and shamed by a man. It
is the story of a woman who fails
herself and blames another; the
implicit message for the artist is not

to let someone else steal her dream.
Maria Sevida, on the other hand, is
a powerful inspiration for the fe-
male artist. Cofer feels a sacred
alliance with this Maria, whom she
describes as “the smartest woman
in Puerto Rico,” because she mar-
ried an assasin.

Maria Sevida was able to sum-
mon the traditionally male quality
of “macho,” which Cofer defines as
the arrogance to assume you belong
where you choose to stand. Al-
though she must constantly sleep
with one eye open in order to pre-
serve her. safety, Maria Sevida has
used the power of words to conquer
her fear and vanquish her villian.

Cofer sees the story not only as
the parable of a good woman tam-
ing a bad man, but as a powerful
metaphor for the woman writer who
must overcome her own personal
villain in order to create.

Cofer also read several poems.
She read one of the few “Southern-
Puerto Rico” poems in existence,
which described her employment
by an overly affectionate Southern
woman in a bakery shop at the age
of fifteen. She also read two poems
that she wrote for her only daugh-
ter, Tanya.

. Cofer sees writing as an essen-

- tial activity in her life, since it helps

her to discover “what I know and
whatI don’tknow. Often, it’s more
of what I don’t know.”
