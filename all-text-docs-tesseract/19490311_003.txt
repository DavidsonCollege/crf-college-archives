The end of the 1949

brings down the cur-

be around for another
tour of the gridiron as well as the basketball court.

Mike Williams, Whit Cobb and Henry Neisler move from
one court to another, They haye already picked up their
tennis rackets to scrap for slots on Coach Derriek Barton's
ace squad. Cobb will also find sometinia to slip on spikes and
skip around the cinder paths for Pete Witte.

Kd Hopper, Bill Iverson and Tommy Haller will also be
seen the rest of the spring with the Cat trek squad. Hopper
and Llaller will team with Bill Pritchett to form a mean punch
in the hurdles, Husky Bill will plod his way over the mile and

two-utile courses,

Only contribution of Coach Norman Shepard to the dia
mond is piteher Dutch Henegeveld. As a freshman last year.
Dutch was one of the most effective men that Coach Charley
damerson had. In early drills le has shown some of his old
form.

Baseball workouts began this week. Jamerson will have a
tough job in finding material to fill in the vacancies whieh
have opened. Professional ranks have claimed fast year's ace
battery of Dick Marlow and Poole. In the outfield
capable replacements will be needed for two slots. Center
fielder Jack Burris failed to return to school this year and has

only Auburn Lambeth in the outer-garden, Jamerson has been

using Bert Anderton, a converted infielder, in the orehard
for the opening sessions and he will probably draw a stabting
assignment. The other slot is still wide open.

Jolin Ellis will cover first, Charlie Pearson and Jake Wade

The mound staff, though missing Marlowe, seems to be
well set with a erew of veterans. Norman Whiteheart seems
to be back in form, After a tine freshman year, Whiteheart
was sidelined most of last Vear with an ailing flipper. Charleton
Vorrenee, Ilengeveld and Dick Blank, who. returns after a
vear out of sehool, will form with Whiteheart a staff of right-

Cat three years ago, but was sidelined by the appearance of
Poole last year.

Over all it looks like Coach Charley has a lot of work
ahead of him to mold a truely effective conbine. Not being
able to use freshmen is a severe blow to the Cat cause. Sueh
vearlings as John Jervis, Herman Hayden, and Jack, Branch
could go a long way toward easing the situation.
