Ducking The Challenge

Lefiy Driesell wan't the only Da-
-nidson man squirming in hig zeat a
couple of weeks back when Carolina
went to the NCAA hoaketball finals in
Los Angeles.

You see, Charlie Scott, Carolina's
erackerjack sophomore guard. nearly
eaime to Davidson. And the way Drie-
sell and a Jot of other folks had it
figured, if Scott had been 5 Wildeat
and not a Tar Heel, Davidson and not

Progressive
Anachronism

Events this week have potnted ont
that Davidson Es still a small Southern
college in a small Southera town. de-
spite that placebo of intellectual pro-
fressiveness that we so ofien put on,

The anachronism of a barter shop
in this dittle community owned and
siafied by Negroes that serves only
whites aud black students is a throw:
baek to the days of the Confederate
soleier.

The student bodv will decide the
issue. If students refuse to patronize
Johnson’s Barber Shop, the boycott
will succeed because of the economic
power of the students. If most stu-
dents do not observe the boycott,
Johnson's policy of racial discrimina’
tion, and the status quo in the rest of
the town, will become firmly fixed
for years to come.

Now we will see if Davidsen stu-
dents live in the South of today or are
laboring under the delusions of 100
years ago,

Carolina would've teen in LA.

But Charlie Scolt is a Negra. and
that probably had a Jot to do with his
Iast-minute ducision io piay ball else-
where.

Davidson is no place for a Negro.
Until a few years ago. they were bar
ted from admission here by offictat
college policy, and even now they
nicht as well be.

Social benefits. limited to whites.
are practically nil fec blacks. There is
apparently no overt hastility shawa
to the current Negro students, but
then nobody is going out of his way to
make them feel welcome cither. And
worst of all, despite their scant num-
ber here, the college seems content to
sit back and shrug st off.

It won't werk. Davidson can no
longer ignore the Negra and other
minerily groups.

A new dav is coming for America,
and espdcially the South, when New
roes will no longer be second-class
citizens. A good college would accept
the change as it materializes, a great
college would anticipate it and help
it along.

But Davidson is daing neither, Neg-
roes are not coming here, for obvious
reasons, aud nobody is doing any-
thing to rectify the situation.

There are qualified Negro students.
in the South, but we don’t get them
because they go elsewhere—to Caro-
lina, Duke, the Ivy League. We must
go out after them, and once they are
here, we must do more to insure thot
they stay.

Then Jf we do all that, maybe the
next time a Charlte Scott comes along,
we'll get him instead.

Behind Dorm Doors

The propose! for open dorms ao
widely distributed on campaign plat-
forms and sn eadily forgotien after-
wards has some dehalte merit.

1f for no ather reason. it could be
adopted as the only sute method of
Buaranteeinp the periodic cleaning of
tlormiiory rooms — a oruch more ef:
Adient way than the sporadic empty:
ing of waste haskels by the callege’s
janiterial staff.

There ave, of course. other advan
tages which might aeceve from the
adoption of such a prapesal in oddi-
tion to increasing the efficiency of
the janiterial system. For instance,
there is the matter of privaey. a rather
unknown situation for a Davideon stu-
dent and his date while on campus.
Those whe have ever sought privacy
in the College Unian or in o fraternity
house know the bepelessness of the.
situation.

Though the callege provides a great
veriety of wide apen spaces. the less
hardy and thase who merely wish to
talk to thelr date or listen to their own

choice of music would certainly find
the open dorms proposal agreeable.

The case for open dorms is not as
trosg for a school like Davidson as it
is far a coeducational institution. but
such 4 _pranesut is feasible and proba-
bly dagirable,

But accompanying a program like
this is the old shibboleth of “student
tesponsibilitv.” For the program to
operate effectively students must dis-

Jay a cortain level of imnturity, a
evel which recent episodes of fire in
the darms seem 10 demonstrate to be
as yet unatiained, ;

Finally, if such a program is adept-
ed, it must allow a torge measure of
student freedam in implementing it.
Tae open darms atrangement is worth-
less unless the student is made re-
sponsible for isis own conduct rather
{han beimg monitored by an expanded
security force,

The issnes of student responsibility
and freedom will have to be faced if
the propesal is seriously considered.
But, then, is anyane zeriously consid.
ering it?

The Same Old Song

Laditing for some excitement? Some
controversy? Same hard-hitting, forth-
right discussion of the issves this poli-
tical year?

Then don't try the North Carolina
gubernatorial campaign. So far the
five candidates have provided all the
excitement of 2 dull chapel speaker.

What started out es the state's mast
promising campaign in decades just
hasn't materialized,

Lest fall, when ft all staried, it
looked like # natural. In one carner,
the headline -hogging, brash James’

Hershey

Credit Eugene McCarthy with the
hest idea yel in the 1968 Presidential
campaign,

Draft Director Lewis B. Hershey.
McCarthy says, should be canned.

It's not that he isn’t getting the
manpower to arnt our natio de-
fense, Hershey always pets his man—
and usually more. And all the while
he's spewing forth with that distorted

hilasophy of his, glowing in the
Fnowledge that he controls the lives
of most of America’s young males,

As Sen. McCarthy pot it “Men
like Herahey must be replaced by ad-
ministrators who understand that the
object of the draft is to defend demo-
gracy, uot to suppress free speech.

It's men like MeCasthy we need in
high national office. Men like Her-
shey we can well do without.

yarn dealer, John Stickely—the first

mary in memory.

in the other, dairy farmer Robert

Melville Broughton, labeled “Old
School" whether he Uked it or not—
both sons af former Democratic gov-
ernors,

And seumewhere in the middle. Dr.
Reginald Hawkins, the Negro dentist
who represents a faction no matter
how yuu cut it.

But somehow all that promise and
potential just hasn't ponned out.

_Oh, issues are being discenaed all
right, but they are the snene kesues
candidates have parroted for years.
Coming out for better schvols, better
roads and lower taxes has been fash-
jonable for some time.

Meanwhtle, the state's important
problems—race, unemployment, the
cities—are being ignored. As a politi--
eal sclence professor at the University
of North Carolina observed the other
day, the candidates seam fixed on
“God and motherhood with no tax
raise."

Howkine is in fact the anly candi-
date sn far with the hanesty and forti-
tude to express his convictions. The
others are only clinging to platitudes.

it’s a sorry state of affairs when car
didates for the state's highest office
behave like Gardner, Stickely. Scott
and Broughton have been behaving,
Government in this stite haa never
been much to much to crow about, and
after watching this campaign, it's

hardly surprising.

Sound And Fury
Signify Nothing

By CHARLES McEWEN
Assoclate Ediior

Call it what you will.

“Manner of Speaking,” “Toward More Pletaresque
Speech." “Notes and Comment,” “Pols and Pans, Top

of My Head."

Words strung together, sometimes with a high
degree of art and style, sometimes not, Like these

quoles,

From George Core’s introduction to “Regionalism

and Beyond," an edited volume of the essuvs of Randall

Stewart:

"H( i4 easy to imagine Stewart having a glass of

champagne and a cigar in the celestial grass with Mel-
ville and Hawthorne, and joining them in the camic
songs Melville speculated about writing in paradise.
One can hear them talking far into the night — as
Melville and Howthorne once did in the sacred pre-
cinets of Mrs. Howthorne's sitting raom — about all
possible and }mpossible matters; and if he listens long
and well, one might hear Hawthorne and Stewart up-

lauding Melville as he repents, ‘I stand for the heart!
To the dogs with the headt' “

And again. this ime from a letter by Ray MoMIl-
lin to THE DAVIDSONIAN:

“My immature friends, you are quick to pounce
on hypocracy (sic) in olhers wherever you can ferrat
it out while you blandly allow yourselves the freedom
fo practice hypocracy (sicl of the grossest sort.”

From “The Education of Honry Adams,” by Henry

dame:
“The chief wonder of education is that IL docs not
ruin everyhody concerned in ft, teachers and taught.”
But Shake re said it best... . full of sound

abd fury,/ Signifying nothing.”

two years he goes through
the rigmarole of ROTC.

Why docs he stumble
around the soccer field every
week? There is really only
one reason—two make sure
that the students who wish
to may receive fifty dollars
thet month, to insure that
very few of them go to Viet-
nam.

Ho fs required to particl

under the present atrange-

fore they make this decision.

Few freshmen even think
about the advanced program,
because Le Army directs kts

I would also guess that few
sophomores take the adyanc-

The Prospect Of Activism

In the pest few years, columnists in this news:
paper have served as wise sages who make profound
and meaningful statements on the world around tham.
Students read their words with the same awe and
humility with which they listen io the wisdom of past
ROTC professors.

Well, not exactly. Wisdom and 1 met once in a
booth at Hatties, but the encounter was brief and |
haven't seen him since. But every now and then, like
as long as the powers let me write, I hope to present
some interesting interviows with a varicty of people,
from revolutionaries to Vietnamese students. with a
few barbs and comments thrown here and there.

Whenever I put off the column anti! the last min-
ute, there will be the old bull that college newspapers
thrive on. And far be it from me to fail to make hock
out of some features of life around here.

It will be a dry day at Hatiies when people around
here don't take tlme to attack some of the anachronis-
tic features of life in the piedmont pines. Students
have been attacking such relics as a dry campus. closed
dorms and in loco parentis longer than Sgt. Rock has
been in the Arasy.

But jusi tike Vietnam sayed comic book writers
from fighting Germany for 25 years, so the recent
barber shop controversy has saved the critics from
rehashing the old issues. At last students will be spared
another lecture on the desirability of liquor in the
water fountains or the need for mere drink machines
in the dorms.

According to the Charloiie Observer. students
here are becoming more sympathetic to the struggles
of the Afro-Americans. But the result of the barber
shop controversy will speak with more authority than
any newspaper. If students are actually interested in
protecting human rights, they will-honor the boycott.

But Ym afraid that students are basically canser-
vative when their own personal habits are at stake.
} nave heard too many students pledge to honor the

oycott until they need a haircut—and then no more.
For them. the prospect of an afternoon under Hood
Norton's shears holds little appeal.

Some of the boycott leaders are talking about
oviding barbers in the dorm ar Union for a few
ours each week, They alsa plan to provide transpor-

tation to other barber shops in the area.

But if the boycott should prove successful, the
results will have {arreaching affects. Expect to see
more activism among .the Negroes in Davidson and
among students here. Maybe even Davidson will be
wept up by the activism that has covered some col-
leges for years.
