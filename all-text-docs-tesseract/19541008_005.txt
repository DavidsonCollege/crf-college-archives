THE DAVIDSONIAN

Last week's victory
over The Citadel
brings several interest-
ing points out of Dav-
idson football records.
Checking back into the
record books, we
found that it had been
seven long years since
: a Wildcat club had
won three games in a
row. Back in 1947, the
Davidson team finish-
ed the season by win-
ning its last three con-
tests. The '47 squad
has the best record of

By JIM HOLSHOUSER any post-war Davidson
outfit, winning 6, losing only 3, and tying one. It looks as
though that record may be broken this ‘season, though the
end is still a long way off.

Checking even further back into the dust-covered books,
we discovered that if the Cats pull out a victory over Presby-
terian tonight, it will almost make history. The last time that
a Davidson club won four games in a row was back in 1927 dur-
ing the “Era of Champions.” So there has been a period of
over twenty-five years in which no Davidson outfit has been
able to win four straight. In 1926, when the Wildcats were
the State Champions, they won a record five-in-a-row.

Another interesting fact about the Wildcats this season
is that after three games, the Davidson defense has allowed
only two touchdowns to the opposition, and in conference play,
the Red and Black remains unbeaten, untied, and unscored-
on. It’s quite a change from last season. After three contests,
the ’53 Cats had allowed 12 TD’s, including eight given up to
Georgia Tech in the opening game. Davidson had only scored

“one time in three games, compared to the eight markers thus
far this season.

The Cats have already won more games this year than
the teams of the past two seasons combined, and it appears
that this year’s record might be the best ever.

Tonight’s game with Presbyterian will mark the fourth
consecutive time that the meeting of the Wildcats and the Blue
Hose has been a Homecoming game for one of the schools.
Starting in 1951, with the Wildcats being the home club, the
two Presbyterian teams have taken turns spoiling alumni
day for three seasons. On all three occasions, the decisions
have been made on the accurate toe of an extra-point kicker.
Last year, Davidson missed all three tries and lost, 19-18.

The fact that Davidson is considered by many as PC’s
“rich uncle” of the Presbyterian institutions always gives the
South Carolina boys an added incentive to take the measure
of the Wildcats. Certainly, the battle between the two teams
is always as hard-fought as you'll see anywhere, and occasion-
ally the spirited competition results in a flare of temper,
though it comes in the stands more often than on the field.
But the Davidson coaches recognize the fact that the Blue
Stockings would rather beat the Wildcats than any other
team, and the Cat mentors have worked hard getting the
team to realize that.

The last time that Davidson visited Clinton, the Cats
edged the Blue Hose, 13-12, in a real thriller. Presbyterian had
the ball on the Davidson 10 yard-line with less than four min-
utes to play in the game, and it looked like dhe PC alumni
would be going home happy that night. But the Wildcat de-
fense stiffened and held the South Carolinians, and Davidson
took over and ran out the clock. No doubt, the Presbyterian
crew remembers that game and is waiting for revenge.

Tonight, the Red and Black rates the favorite’s role as a
result of three straight victories and PC’s record of two loss-
es in their last two outings. But when these two clubs tangle,
past records and odds might as well be thrown out the win-
dow.

PHI DELTS, KAs
PACE GRID ACTION

Interfraternity competition began
for the school year as the flicker-
ball season opened last Monday.
The number of close games indi-
cates a tough scramble for the
championship.

On Monday, the opening day, the
S.A.E.’s and the Kappa Sigs clash-
ed in a defensive battle which re-
vealed two well-matched teams.
However Corky Clark scored early
in the game to give the Kappa Sigs
a 7-0 victory. The K.A.’s proved to
be too much for the Campus Club,
who used a no-kick strategy. On
the last play of the game, the Reb-
els turned a pass interception into
their third touchdown and won 20-0.
The Phi Delts, last year’s co-cham-
pions downed the Sigma Chis, also
defending co-champs, 14-13, in the
day’s closest gamé. The two point-
after-touchdown passes, both
caught by Doug Andrews, gave the
Phi Delts the victory. During the
last few minutes of the game the
Sigma Chis were within one yard
of scoring territory but lost the bal]
on downs when they were unable
to push across the goal line.

On Tuesday, the A.T.O.’s beat
the Pi Kappa Phis, 20 to 6. Charlie
Gribble sparked the victors to the
win over the hard-playing Pi Kapps.
The Pikas overcame the Phi Gamms
by five points as Joe Billy Pharr
caught the final touchdown pass
that brought the winners from be-
hind and gave them the 25 to 20
victory. The S.P.E.’s scored two six-
pointers and a safety, but: lost to
the very fast Beta team, 20-14. The
Betas made an impressive showing.

On Wednesday, the Sigma Chis
swamped the Campus Club, 47-0
with the victors exhibiting a tricky
and smooth working offense. By de-
feating the S.A.E.’s, the K.A.’s won
their second straight game of the
season. The score, 14-7, revealed
how close the game was. The Phi
Delts outscored the Pi Kapps, 30
to 24, in an offensive battle and
won their second straight game,
too.

13-0 Win Over Citadel

BY BUNNY PERKINSON

As the result of a tight defense and the ability to capitalize
on breaks, Davidson’s Wildcats downed the highly-rated Cita-
del Bulldogs by a 13-0 count in Charleston last Saturday night.
The hard-charging ’Cats’ line limited the Cadets to 126 yards
rushing; and only once did Duby Rierson, the pre-season pick
of many for All-Southern Conference honors at quarterback,
get far into the secondary. That play covered 16 yards, the

longest single gain the Citadel made all night.

While the Cats’ defense stood
firm, the offense’ kept constantly
gh the move, amassing 210 yards
rushing and 113 yards via the air.
Forty yards in penalties slowed the
'Cats at times, but it was always
only temporary, as the backs put
on a splendid display of running
ability. Coach Dole labeled each
back who played, outstanding.

During the first few minutes of
the game, it looked as though those
people who called the game a toss-
up were exactly right. However,
this feeling was dispelled in the
second period, as the ’Cats drove
65 yards in 14 plays to the Citadel
5 yard-line, only to lose the ball
on a fumble. The end of the half
saw Dyke Little completing two
consecutive passes, the first to
Harley Smith and the second to
Greg Poole, each for 27 yards. How-
ever, the clock ran out before an:
other play could be run, and the
score was still knotted at 0-0.

Soon after the second half kick-
off, Henry Brown snared a Rier-
son pass and headed down the side-
lines, being run out cf bounds
on the Citadel 36 yard-line. A few
plays later, Brown rammed it over
from the two, Bob Talbert booted
the extra point, and Davidson led,
7-0. The third quarter ended short-
ly thereafter.

Early in the fourth period, a
Bulldog punt was taken by Jimmy
Thacker in Davidson territory and
returned to the Citadel 46. A pass
and several blasts through the line
moved the ball inside the Cadets’
10. Harley Smith carried to the
goal line, but a penalty nullified
the gain: so, running the same play,
he bulled to the one. Bill Rowland
sneaked over from that point. Tal-
bert's kick was wide, thus ending
the scoring for the night.

Cross-Country Team

Off To Maryville

Coach “Pete” Whittle and eight
varsity men left yesterday for
Maryville, Tennessee, for the first
cross-country meet of the 1954 sea-
son. The Wildcat runners were
scheduled to meet the Maryville
College team this afternoon.

The Davidson squad has been
working hard in daily workouts,
and is in good shape for the meet.
The runners have been steadily im-
proving and stand an excellent
chance of bringing home a first-
meet win.

The members -of the squad who
made the trip to Maryville are:
Pete Ashcraft, Floyd Feeney, Dick
Lovette, John Handley, Gordon
Bondurant, John Patterson, Gerald
Wilson, and Bill Walker.

Next week, the squad will be at
home for the first Southern Confer-
ence meet of the season. On Satur-
day, the Wildcats will play host to

the visiting Richmond squad. It

wilt also be the first home meet
of the current season.

outstanding would be a near-im-
possible task, so well did the en-
tire team perform. However, it
should be mentioned that Don Mc-
Ree led Davidson's ground gaining
with 61 yards in 11 carries, and
Dyke Little, in addition to his two
27 yard tosses, completed a 15-
yarder to Tom Newton for a total
of 69 yards.

In the line, there was not a man
who did not play exceptionally
well, and one platoon was as strong
as the other. A similar display of
defensive strength and offensive
punch should be enough to stop
Presbyterian tonight.

Davidson Continues
To Pace Conference

For the third straight week, Da-
vidson’s Wildcats lead the Southern
Conference, and though only five
of the nine conference teams have
seen action with other conference
opponents, only three conference
clubs can boast an unblemished
record in over-all play.

Davidson, V.P.1., and West Virginia
all remain undefeated, with David-
son and V.P.I. having won three,
and West Virginia winning one.
West Virginia opened its season
last Saturday by trouncing South
Carolina, of the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference, 26-6. V.P.I. won its third

straight game ,gver “ACC foes as
they downed Clemson\ 18-7. Pre-
viously, the Gobblers had- beaten

N. C. State and Wake Forest.

Davidson, by virtue of a 13-0 win
over The Citadel, pushed its con-

ference record to two wins and no

losses. The Cats have only one
more league foe to play this sea-
son. They meet Furman in Char-
lotte on October 22.

This week-end finds only two
conference contests on tap. Rich-
mond opens its conference season
by traveling to Charleston to meet
The Citadel, and West Virginia
plays host to George Washington in
the other family affair.

Presbyterian Foes Clash
With Davidson Favored

Davidson's winning Wildcats move to Clinton, South Caro-
lina, tonight where they will meet the Blue Hose of Presby-
terian College in a game which promises to have all the usual
fireworks that come when the two Presbyterian schools clash
in any way.

Riding the crest of a three-game
winning streak, the Wildcats rank
a two-touchdown favorite, but there
aré several factors which may

taking seven wins and Presbyterien

change matters considerably.

The major point is that the game
is to be played before a Presby-
terian homecoming crowd, and the
P. C. team will undoubtedly be
“up” for the contest. The South
Carolina school always manages
to play one of their best games
against Davidson, and the natural
rivalry produces very close battles
most of the time.

Presbyterian’s great left-handed
passer, Harry Hamilton, will be
ready to sling for the Blue Hose,

and those who saw last season's
contest remember how he ripped
the Wildcat pass defense to shreds.
Last season, he completed 72 of 176

high in national ratings.

The Davidson-Presbyterian series
started back in 1919, with the first
game ending in a scoreless tie.

fully ten minutes after he’s done it.| Since then, the two schools have

in the first contest.

The series has always had close
games, and the greatest margin of
victory for either team came in
1950, when the Wildcats racked up
a 240 decision. Since then, the
games have been decided by ex-
tra points. In 1951, the Hose edged
Davidson in a Cat Homecoming
game, 14-12. In 1982, Davidson
tuined the Presbyterian Homecom-
ing by winning, 13-12, and last year
the Blue Stockings returned the
medicine again by beating the Cats,
19-18, at Davidson’s Homecoming.

Last week, Presbyterian met Fur
man’s Purple Hurricane and came
out on the short end of a 27-0 score.
However, the game was much cloe .
er than the score indicated, with
Furman capitalizing on the breaks
to win. The Blue Hose almost
matched Furman in first downs,
and the first-string lines looked al-
most even.

Davidson will be at near-full
strength for the game, though a
couple of men will be noticeably
missing. Jim Fasul, first-string
guard will be sitting out the battle,
after suffering a pulled leg muscle
early this week. His absence will
be partly off-set by the return of
Harry Peterson. “Pete” saw limit-
ed action against The Citadel and
will be ready to go full steam
against Presbyterian.
