Davidson ‘Null And Void’ For

BSC Seeks Student Reco onition

“We try to get the college to

that we are on the

campus and that we have dif-

ferent needs,” said Marian

Perkins, president of the Black
Student Coalition.

“‘Our tastes run very different
from most activities sponsored
by the Union,’’ she said.

This is a problem the BSC is
trying to overcome this week by
sponsoring black oriented
films, the Broadway production
of “‘The River Niger,” Satur-
day’s concert by Ripple and the
following party in Chamber’s

basement.

‘Before this week, however,
there has ‘been very little
publicized of the BSC’s ac-
tivities.

“Hopefully we will take a
more active part in the David-
son community in the future,”
said Pat Hudson, BSC treasurer
and College Union co-curricular
chairman.

“We have given halloween
parties with day care children
the past two years. Also, the
concert by ‘“‘Ripple’’ and the
party will be open to all studen-
ts and Davidson community for
free,”’ he said. |

The BSC has not planned
many social activities for the
group itself.

‘‘We've had one party—a bir-
thday party,’’ said Ralph

Holloway, a BSC member.
“That was good in that it got
together.

fortunately, we dont have many

The group’s relatively low
proile stems from a variety of
reasons.

“Davidson College is null and
bie for black people,’’ Hudson

“There is nothing to keep a
black person here on the
weekends, so there is no great
school spirit. Because of that,
it’s hard to get a great deal of
work done with the BSC,’ he
said.

“Right now more is being
done by the BSC than I’ve seen
done in my two years here,’’ he
said.

“We try to make life a little
bit easier for the black
student,”’ said Perkins.

‘The BSC functions basically
as a gathering through weekly
meetings,”’ she said.

‘The BSC is a necessary func-
tion. It’s neat to know the people
in the group. We are from so
many. different backgrounds.

Holloway said.

‘‘We would like to get more

said.

“We also work with Larry
Barr in admissions and try to
get the college to recruit black
students,’’ she said.

The recruiting does not seem
to entail blind optimism about
the school.

“I tell potential black studen-
ts exactly what I think about
Davidson,” she said.

Members of the BSC are en-
couraged to join other ex-

Even though the BSC is
somewhat short of man power
as Davidson College is short of
black students, the BSC does
not want white membership.

though that the new board
would intensify local priorities

John Hedrick

“I think the new people are
more interested in local con-
cerns” Barron stated. However
he was concerned with ‘What's
frustrating me is that nobody
ever seems to get excited about

it” Barron said. “It's really
frustrating trying to get -
anything started."

Particulary of interest in this
area is brown lung disease. or
bysinosis. This is the top issue
of Davidson PIRG, according to
Hedrick.

Brown lung disease is caused
by excessive inhalation of cot-
ton dust in the textile mills. The
predominant syptom is short-
ness of breath and _ is
statistically considered the fifth
Major occupational hazard in
the United States.

The coordinators of the brown
lung project are Lamas and
Alexander.

“We are pushing it as our No.
1 priority’’ said Hedrick. He
pointed out that although he
recognized that importance of
local issues state projects hould
not be ignored.

“We can’t focus solely “on
local issues but a combination .

since. we’re a_ state
organization,’’ asserted
Hedrick.

He also sees Davidson PIRG_
continuing to help interested
students start, pursue, finish
follow up those projects of local
concern.

McKeithen indicated that
financial support was needed.

“We need to continue finan-
cial support from students
McKeithen said. PIRG is now
getting its operational funds
from an optional $3 added to the

Housing is another project of
local interest that is under con-
sideration for spring term.
