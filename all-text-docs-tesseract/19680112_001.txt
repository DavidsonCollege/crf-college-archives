INDUCTION_ DELAYED

9 Students Protest Draft

A handful of Davidson stu-
dents braved  subfreezing
temperatures today to join
picket lines at the Charlotte
induction center in a demon
stration of sympathy for

George Vlasits, who says he
will refuse induction into the
U. S. armed forces.

Viasits’ induction, schedul-
ed for today in Raleigh, was
called off on account of the

DRAFT ‘BASICALLY UNDEMOCRATIC’
Viasits assails Vietnam war.

Draft Immoral,

Objector Claims

By OICK ANDERSON
Staff Writer

A former teacher and grad-
uate student who plans to re-
fuse induction into the army
spoke here Wednesday night
on his opposition to the draft.

George Viasits, wearing a
pink shirt with a blue tie and
a green coat, gave four rea
sons for opposing the draft.
“First. the draft is basically
undemocratic. It forces peo-
ple to do things that they
wouldn't otherwise do. Free-
dom is basically antithetical
to this.’ he said.

Viasits also charged that
the draft is discriminatory.
immoral and_ interrelated
with the war in Vietnam. He
said that without the war
there would be no draft, and
without the draft there could
be no war.

After Vlasits made a short
talk, there was a question
and answer period in which
Viasits was sharply question
ed. About two dozen: people.
including two members of
the administration, heard at
least parts of the discussion.

Unlike many of those re-
sisting the draft, Viasits has
signified his willingness to
accept punishment under the
law, including almost cer-
tain imprisonment. He drew
praise from most of those

Election

Season
To Start

Tentative dates have been
set for the election of a new
Miscellany editor, Social
Council chairman and Union
Board president.

Bruce Weihe. Student Coun-
cil Elections Committee
chairman, said today that
these elections will be held
during the week of Feb. 4-10,
the week after Rush Week.

He added that the setting
of filing dates would be up to
the organizations for which
the new officers will be elect-
ed.

According to Sam. Boyte.
chairman of the Publications
Board which must approve
the Miscellany candidate,
anyone seeking that editor-
ship must file with Buddy

present, including. those not
approving his stand. for this
position.

Davidson students picketed
the Charlotte induction cen.
ter today in an anti-draft
movement.

“My positive responsibility

toward the people of the.

United States is to oppose an
unjust and immoral law,”
said Vlasits, when challeng.
ed that he offered only a
negative position on the war.

Vliasits offered an indict-
ment of the fact that there is
no alternative method of
serving the nation besides
the draft.

Vlasits attended the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill as a graduate
student in sociology. He is a
member of Phi Beta Kappa
and was a teacher before go-
ing to graduate school. He is
also a member of the South-
ern Student Organizing Com
mittee (SSOC).

weather, according to Lyn
Wells, campus organizer for
the Southern Student Organ-
izing Committee (SSOC).

Miss Wells said Vlasits'
induction is now scheduled for
next Wednesday.

Nine Davidson _ students,
who joined picket lines at 7
a.m. and noon. marched with
several Charlotte residents
and students from the Univer.
sity of North Carolina at
Charlotte and Belmont Ab
bey College.

They marched for about 45
minutes in the morning dem-
onstration and for about an
hour at noon. The pickets
eafried signs reading ‘‘The
Draft Is Un-American.”’:*'Old
Soldiers Never Die—Just
Young Ones.”’ ‘Vietnam for
the Vietnamese” and “Li
cense To Kill."

John Pancake. one of the
student protesters, explained
why the protest was held:

“Normally when you dis-
agree with a policy or insti.
tution of the government, you
can change it within the elec.
tion system. However right
now there are no ways to
vote against the draft because
there are few politicians who
oppose the draft.’

“To try to change this sit-
uation,’’ he added. ‘we at-
tempt to get people to think
about their position on the
draft. We feel that by calling
attention to the draft through
protest, we can promote
thoughtful consideration of
the draft."

The demonstrations were
peaceful throughout. There
were no incidents.

Several passers by heckled
the demonstrators, however,
yelling obscenities at them.
And at the noon demonstra-
tion, two counter pickets
marched in the midst of the
students.

The counter pickets, men
who appeared to be in their
thirties, carried signs read.
ing “Win in Vietnam" and
“We Don't Want Any Draft
Dodgers.”

At one point, a man wear-
ing civilian clothes came out
of the induction center with
coffee for the counter pickets.

Charlotte police did a good
job maintaining order. ac.
cording to Pancake, a David-
son junior who helped organ-
ize the march.

There were two uniformed
policemen at the door of the
induction center. which is

located at 914 Pecan Ave.
Others stayed in nearby cars.

The temperature at 7 a.m.
today was 17 degrees. At

7 we soy,

noon it had climbed to only
20 degrees.

A total of some 30 marchers
participated in the two dem:
onstrations, held simultan.
eously with a demonstration
in Raleigh. The N. C. demon.
strations were sponsored by
the N. C. Student Committee
Against the War (SCAW).

Viasits. a 25-year-old for.
mer teacher, applied recent.
ly for reclassification from
1-A to that of conscientious
objector and was refused.

Last Oct. 20 he was one of
some 1,080 young men who
handed in ‘Heir draft cards
to the U. S. Justice Depart
ment.

Viasits cduld face a charge
of nonpossession of a card as
well as draft resistance. if he
refuses induction next Wed
nesday.

Welsh’s Concerto
To Debut Monday

A unique musical work will
have its world premiere here
Monday night.

Wilmer Welsh's “Concerto
for Voice and -Orchestra.”
which will be performed for
the Artist Series by soprano
soloist Ilona Kombrink and
the Chicago Little Symphony
is unusual in several re-
spects

The concerto is unique he-
cause it uses the voice of Miss
Kombrink as if it were an or-
chestral instrument. After she
sings the introductory text for
each of the three movements.
she vocalizes an ‘‘aah"’ sound
throughout the remainder of
the movement. :

Welsh, associate professor
of music, has been in Chicago
during the past week for re-
hearsals with Miss Kombrink
and the symphony.

Welsh wrote the work ex-
pressly for Miss Kombrink.
He decided to-write it for her
after she performed last year

Glassy Glaze, Sore Seats

Umbrellas, slick sidewalks and slightly
bruised posteriors were the main course
on the menu for Davidson students all

week.

This diet proved rather distasteful to
all and especially unpleasant for those
suffering injuries from falls on the icy

pavements.

Senior Price Cameron slipped on the
walk at the east end of Duke Dormitory,
flipped over backwards and sustained a
dislocated collarbone. He spent the night
in the emergency ward at Memorial Hos-

The concerto takes _ its

In commenting on the con-

“I am terribly excited —there

colors that you can‘t pull me

“Both Miss Kombrink and
I feel a piece of music to be
sung should give as much
freedom of interpretation for

has to say something there

composer) have said.”

Selection Group

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Managing Editor

The trustee committee appointed. this week to find a suc-
cessor to President D. Grier Martin has asked the Student
Council to name a student committee to assist in the. selection

process.

In a letter to student leaders this week. Trustee President

of up to four students to consult with the trustee selection com-

Successor Not

Picked

By BOB DUNHAM
News Editor
Representatives from both
the college administration
and the trustee selection
committee denied rumors
this week that -a successor
for President D. Grier Mar
tin was chosen before he an

nounced his resignation.

Both Bill Roundurant, as-
sistant to the president, and
Walter L. Lingle Jr.. of Cin
cinnati, Ohio, president of the
Board of. Trustees. refuted
the charges that. the forma
tion of a selection committec
is just a formality which will
be used to rubber stamp the
original selection.

It was rumored by uniden
tified sources at the college
that the selection was made
by a group of three or four
trustees who either knew
about or suspected Martin's
plans to resign.

While the reasons given
were not explicit, the per
sons behind the rumors cited
an offer of a top-level admin
istrative job at Davidson to
an educator last fall as evi-
dence. The offer was not ac-
cepted.

Lingle. who is also the
chairman of the trustee se-
lection committee. said yes-
terday in a telephone inter.
view, “there is absolutely
nothing to the rumor, and it
is as simple as that.”

‘We are extremely anxious
to get all possible sugges-
tions.” he added, ‘‘and we
are not going to talk about
anyone until ample time has
been given for suggestions
from all parties concerned.”

Bondurant referred to the
rumor as one which ‘‘tends
to muddy the water" at a
time when “every effort is
being made to find the right
man.”*

He denied any charges of
“éoup d'main”™ tactics on

Lingle

the part of the selection com
mittee, saying, “‘These are
men of integrity .and great
love for Davidson College.
All the. work they are doing
is strictly above board.”

Bondurant noted that
“there may be men at the
front of the selection commit.
tee’s list.’ but he added that
“there .are many others on
the list.too, and each one will
receive the fullest armnount of
attention,”

He commented on another
aspect of the search, saying
“With the Davidson reputa
tion and resources as they
now stand the committee
will be: able to make Amer
ica its playground in trying
to find the right man to sue
ceed Dr. Martin.

“The committee will look
hard and long at each poi-
sible candidate.” he said,
