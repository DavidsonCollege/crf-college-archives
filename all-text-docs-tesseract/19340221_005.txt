THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 21, 1934

Officers Installed
In Meeting of Eu

Two Talks Are Given on Pro-
gram Following the
Inauguration

BANKS IS PRESIDENT

Douglas, Ross, and Humphrey
Are Other Officers

The newly-elected officers of the
Eumenean Literary Society, Richard
Banks, president; J. M. Douglas, vice-
president; J. H. Ross, Secretary, and
E. J. Humphrey, critic, were installed
at the regular meeting of the society
Tuesday night. Banks in his inaugural
talk pledged the new administration
to a continuance of the excellent work
done the first term.

The literary program following the
installation consisted of a talk by J. D.
Allen on “The Art of Healing,” and
a resume of current events by E. S.
Bivens.

Allen in his talk gave a history of
medicine beginning at pre-ancient time
and coming to the present day. The
advantages and difficulties of becom-
ing a doctor all came under his ad-
dress, which closed with William Allen
Pusey’s remark “that doubtless God
could have made a better man than a
good doctor, but doubtless He never
did.”

Bivens, in his resume of the current
events of the week, discussed particu-
larly the turn of events in Austria,
Austria is suffering from both depres-
sion and Hitler, said Bivens, enough
to trouble any country,

Major JohnT. Rhett
Entertains Officers

Major John T, Rhett entertained at
his home Tuesday evening for the
cadet officers of the Davidson R.’ O,
T. C. battalion. All cadet officers,
numbering about twenty-five, were
present. There were also several girls
from Davidson present. The guests
assembled at the Rhett home at 8
o'clock, refreshments being served later

in the evening. Major Rhett enter-
tained in the same manner for the
cadet officers last year.

Dr. Bessie C. Randolph
Heads Hollins College

President MacCracken of Vassar
to Speak at Installation

The installation of its third president
in nearly a century will mark the cele-
bration of Founders’ Day at Hollins
College on February 21, when Dr.
Bessie Carter Randolph, a distin-
guished graduate, will be formally in-
augurated in the presence of presidents
and other representatives of many col-
leges and universities throughout the
country.

Miss Randolph, a native of Virginia,
received her A.B. degree from Hollins
in 1912 and her M.A. from Radcliffe in
1916, subsequently teaching history and
government at Hollins and at Ran-
odlph-Macon Woman's College in
Lynchburg. In 1924-26 she was a Car-
negie Fellow in International Law at
Radcliffe, receiving her Ph.D. degree
there in 1926. She then became head
of the newly-created department of
political science at the Florida State
College for Women at Tallahassee in
1926, and is widely known in her field.

The speech of President Henry N.
MacCracken of Vassar, and Miss Ran-
dolph’s inaugural address, will be the
main parts of the installation program.

First Act of “Candida”
Finished by Masquers

Coaches Wood and Prof. Erwin
Express Satisfaction of Play

D. Wills Hollingsworth, president of
the Red and Black Masquers, ex-
pressed the opinion early this week
that the society’s coming production,
“Candida,” is progressing unusually
well. Coached by G. R. Wood and
Prof. E. J. Erwin, the players have
completed the first act in the past week
and are well into the second one.

In the completed act, Marchbanks,
the young, embryonic, poetic lover,
played by W. F. Goodykoontz, achieves
a moral and mental victory over Mo-
rell, the real, brutish husband, depicted
by D. W. Hollingsworth, in their clash
over Candida, played by Mrs. W. P.

Cumming. The second act is a rather
discursive one, in which the audience
and the characters all become ac-
quainted with each other, and a good
deal of comedy is injected into the
production by the cockney character,
Burgess, played by Nate Wauda.

Ney was supposed to have been exe-
cuted at Paris after the fall of Na-
poleon; but, as the records of the exe-
cution had flaws, most historians think
he escaped to Charleston, S. C. He
was soon recognized there by some
French inhabitants, came to
Mecklenburg County. Here the mys-
terious man prepared the Davidson

Golf Course to Have
Several Changes Made

Superintendent of Grounds F. D
Hobart announced this week that the
arrangement of the golf course will
be altered in order to make room for
two new fairways. Numbers two and
three holes will be moved so that the
third and fourth holes will be across
the Wilson Road. This change elim-
inates a bad approach and will make
this one of the best places of play on
the entire course.

The golf committee also plans to
move the eighth hole north, to the
bottom of the hill, This change is
made so that it will allow a longer and
better shot.

The committee hopes to have this
project completed by spring and esti-
mates that the entire job will cost ap-
proximately four hundred dollars.
