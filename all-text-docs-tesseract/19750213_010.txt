Cats Sign 7'4” Iowa

This is your roving reporter
once again for The Davidsonian
covering the latest expeditions
of Coach Bo Brickles on his
recruiting journeys. The date is
April 1, 1975 and the place is a
farm in Council Bluffs, Iowa,
where Bo is talking to Samuel
P. Gune, a 7’4”’ -260 pound stan-
dout center for his Eli Whitney
High Harvesters. We’ll listen in
on this stimulating ‘con-
versation:

BB: “Sam, our coaching staff
has been watching you for the
past few years and we feel that
with your statistics of 35 points
and 23 rebounds per game that
you could bring Davidson into
the national basketball scene
again.”’

SPG: “Again, Mr. Brickles,
when was the last time? See, we
don’t git no papers out here on
this here farm.”’

BB: ‘We were nationally
ranked during the days of Mike
Malloy. Surely you’ve heard of
him.”

SPG: “Yeah, isn’t he the guy
who got cut from the Carolina
Cougars of the minor leagues
for being 40 pounds over-
weight?”

BB: ‘‘Yes, but that’s not im-
portant. Back to the original
subject matter. My three
assistants and I feel that next
year with our 5-guard offense
we need a “‘big man’’ to turn us
around and enable us to win the
Southern Conference tour-
nament.”’

SPG: “Is that the one with
Southern Mississippi, Southern
Baptist and Georgia Southern in
ite?

BB: ‘‘No, we play the
powerhouses of The Citadel, Ap-
palachian, and VMI.”

SPG: ‘Well, what was your
record last year?”’

BB: ‘‘We play a great
schedule which includes UCLA,
N.C. State and Notre Dame.”

SPG: “That means I’ll get to
see Adrian Dantley play, but
you haven’t answered my
question-What was your record
last year?”’

BB: “Not only can you see
A.D. play, you’ll be playing
agianst him!”

SPG: “You mean I get to
start my freshman year?”’

BB: ‘Well, we can’t make
any promises, as we do have a
great program we’re proud of.
You see, first we start you off
with a couple of years of JV ball
and after you’ve developed the
basic skills we move you_up to
much stiffer competition in a
league called IMAC.”

SPG: “I do know that one, the
international Miners and Coal
workers. Ya. see, I have this
buddy in West Virginia.”’

: ‘No, no, no! This is an in-
eae group where you can
play against such world legends
as Chico, Rodge, Stick and
YB

SPG: ‘‘Wowee! It sure sounds
great. But, I’d like to know a lit-
tle about you Bo.”’

BB: ‘“‘You mean you haven’t
seen my #1 bestseller of a book
entitled Winning is Easy.’’

SPG: “No, I haven’t. Ya see

Samuel P. Gune
and his high school coach

the country store is 5 miles

away and it only carries comic
books!”

BB: “Well, if you ever get a
chance to go into the big city,
look for my sequel soon to be
released called Take Him Out
When He’s Hot.’’

SPG: “Hold on just a second.
I think I hear my pa coming in.
I’m sure he’ll have a couple of
questions to ask you. (Pa enters
room) Pa. I’d like you to meet
Bo Drickles, the head coach at
Davidson College.”

Mr. G: “‘Hey there. Isn’t that
school in the heart of the Pocono
‘Mountains in Pennsylvania?’”’

Infamous Dr. Q Meets Abbo
As Derelict Duo Hallucinate

When we last left our heroes,
namely us, they were in the
Dread Abbo’s office. Abbo’s of-
fice had the only light on cam-
pus, and Abbo was about to
reveal a startling secret to the
Derelict Duo.

“Well, brothel-breathed fools,
guess what I have in store for
you?’’ Abbo smirked.

‘You’re gonna tell me who
Stan Boskovitch is?’’ exclaimed
C.A. in wondrous glee.

“No, I’m going to make it so
no one can escape Humes. Dick
Smith and Young Buck will look
like geniuses for only taking
four years of Humes. I can
teach Humes forever.

Standout

BB: ‘No, we’re located in
North Carolina, only 15 miles
from the vivacious city of
Charlotte. We have an excellent
academic record and also are
trying to establish an excellent
basketball program. That’s
why we’re trying to sign Sam
here.”’

Mr. G: “I don’t know if my
son’s got enough smarts to en-
ter there at Dickinson.”’

BB: ‘‘Davidson!
cidentally, what were your SAT
board scores, Sam?’’

SPG: “‘I think it was 720.”

BB: ‘On which, verbal or
math?”’
SPG: ‘No, you’ve got it all

wrong, 720 was the combined
score.”’

BB: “Don’t worry. We'll see
what we can do.”’

Mr. G: ‘“‘What about the
social life at Davidson?’’

BB: ‘‘Well, we have a great
new library. Sam can even have
his own carrel.”’

Mr. G: ‘‘My boy don’t want to
be involved with no girls!!
Please, sir, answer my question
— What about the social life?”’

BB: ‘‘We have, without a
doubt, one of.the best economic
departments in the South.”’

SPG: “C’mon Dad. It sounds
like a swell place and this here
man is real nice. Let me go
there.”’

_ Mr. G: ‘Well, it’s up to you.”’

SPG: “Great Mr. Drickles,
whre do I sign?”’

BB: ‘‘Right here next to. this
i?

So, here endeth the continuing
saga of Bo and his staff’s quest
for the ‘“‘big man’’. After Bo had
left Council Bluffs and was on
his way back to the Piedmont
area, I asked Sam about his
signing and he said, ‘‘Well, I
have already talked with Mr.
Wooden and officially signed
with UCLA. I was just fooling
around with this Dri¢kles guy.”’

As Samuel P. Gune whistles
as he walks back to his barn
where he shoots through a
peach basket all day long, this
reporter has only one thing to
say to Coach Bo Brickles, whois
carrying a worthless letter-of-
intent: APRIL FOOLS!

Oh, .. in-.,

“And here is the instrument
of my plan.”

Saying that, Abbo pulled a
piece of paper from his desk. ‘‘I
call it my Doomsday final. Not
even Prof. Langford could pass
this one, Turkies.”’

Our heads whirled to the
sound from our left as a morose
little head popped out of an
otherwise innocent looking
black box and uttered an
acknowledging ‘‘S’all right’’?

Abbo replied, ‘“S’all right,
amigo.”’ /

C.A.’s computer-like mind
spun as he posed the inevitable,
“‘What in the name of Rah Rah
junior is that’’?

“That’s Langford,” said Ab-
bo

Y.B. retorted, ‘Guess he
doesn’t do a whole lot of guest
lecturing anymore, huh Abbo.
No hand gestures either, eh’’?

‘You insolent flunkie,’’ raged
Abbo. “I made him what he is
today.’’

“Yeah, he’s probably real
high on being a black box. I’ve
always wanted to be. one too,”
snorted C.A.

“You seek to deceive me,
cried Abbo, ‘‘but it’s much too
late.”

“With this single Sheet of
paper, I can flunk pre-law, pre-
med and other liberal arts
students forever without any
question at all.

‘Here, look for yourself,
lackies.’’» A hideous roar
emerged from this obviously
possessed man as he handed a
black sheet of paper to this pair
of weiners. Evil pervaded from
its very surface.

On it was written in blood-
stained colors the following:

Read and answer. the
following questions carefully in
any manner you wish, for you
cannot answer them no way, no
how, and in no time. Time limit:
eternity without end.

1. Where does God live?

A) What is his P.O. Box?

B) Bonus: give His zip code--5
points.

2. Who is buried in the tomb of
the unknown soldier?

A) Name his father and
second cousin twice removed.

B) (Hint) It is not Stan
Boskovitch.

3. Identify the following with a
sentence fragment:

A) Gnorg, Gnorg, Spurfle

B) Verlitosis and the 3 symp-
toms ,

C) \

“Boy, C looks pretty tough,”
said C.A.

‘““Yeah,’’ acknowledged Y.B.
“T’ve seen it before on one of
Puss’s spots. Look at the next
question,”’ he said trembling.

4. What did Hollywood say?

“‘T thought he was dead,”’ said

Kors

5. What is, andif so, why?

And at the bottom of the test
was written: I pledge that I
have cheated on this test.

“Of course I never accept an
unpledged test,” chortled Abbo.

“Better than that, there are
only 50 possible points, and I

grade on a scale of 100,” he
screamed.

At this Abbo laughed so
hysterically that he nearly fell
over. Seeing his chance, light-
fingered Young Buck stuffed
the test in his shirt and ex-
claimed, ‘‘Feets don’t fail me
now,’”’ and hotfooted for the
door.

Abbo pressed a button, and
when Y.B. got to the door and
opened it, directly in front of
him was

“Stan Boskovitch, by God,”
exclaimed C.A.

“No, not Stan Boskovitch,”
said the person who looked like
Stan Boskovitch. ‘‘It’s me,
Dave Myers.”’

Saying that, Boskovitch rip-
ped off his mask and stood
revealed as Dave Myers, armed
with an icepick.

“Fools, I knew you would try
something,” said Abbo.

“Yeah, I been waiting ever
since I read about being in an
icepick fight without an
icepick,” said Myers as he ad-
vanced menacingly.

Showing that their minds
work together, our two semi-
mongoloid cowards pointed to
each other and exclaimed, ‘He
wrote it, he wrote it.’

Myers advanced crying out a
nearly unintelligible sound,
“Yum, yum, eat ’em up.”’

Meanwhile, Abbo was closing
in from behind with the four foot .
screws with our names on them.

“This is cookies, C.A.,’’ ut-
tered Y.B.

‘‘Gnahgnahgnahgnahgnah’’
moaned C.A. ala Three Stooges.

“Oh please help us, Mr.
Wizard. I'll never cut another
class,’’ screamed Y.B.

“Man you are desperate,”’
noticed C.A.

Suddenly, a flash of lightning,
the roar of thunder, a mighty hi
ho divine intervention and Dr. Q
himself appeared in Abbo’s of-
fice.

The Q threw a tube of
Clearasil on the floor, and
Myers dove on it. Dr. Q then
said, ‘“‘Frazzle Dee, Frazzle
dumb, time for this one to go
home.”’

The room turned into a
swirling vortex. The last thing
we heard was Abbo muttering,
“Curses, foiled again.’’

Dr. Q just laughed, and when
we awoke, it was 11:30. Young
Buck had slept through the
Geach again.

“C.A., I had the weirdest
dream last night.”’

“Don’t say it, Y.B. I had a
weird one too.’’

It was then we noticed torn up
bits of black paper lying ’round

the room. It rang a bell
(‘‘Ding’’) ,
““Ain’t no way,” said C.A.
“Yeah,” nodded Y.B. ‘We

got to take it a little easier from
now on, We may never get out of
here,’’ the intrepid one
declaimed.

“Yeah,’’ muttered C.A.,
we gonna die trying.’”’

One~of these days, we gonna
blow Davidson out of our shorts.
