dollars principal amount of bonds and
certificates owned by any individua'
partnership association or corporation is
exempt from all United States taxes ex-
cept estate or inheritance taxes. This
ig true tho their total holdings exceed
five thousand dollars. In case of hold-
ings by trustees each beneficiary is en-
titled to independent exemption of the
interest on five thousand dollars princi-
pal amount held in trust for him even
tho the trustee is identical if the trusts
be separate. In case of families the wife
and each child if the actual owner are
entitled to independent exemption of the
interest on five thousand dollars princi-
pal amount so owned.

Four. No ownership certificate or
other so-called information at the source
will be required under the War Reve-
nue Act in connection with the payment
of the interest on these bonds whatever
the amount.

Five. Undistributed. income invested
in these bonds is not subject to the ad-
ditional tax imposed by that Act upon
undistributed income. The foregoing
statements apply to the four per cent
Liberty Bonds now offered for subscrip-
tion and also to those issuable upon con-
version of the three and one-half per cent
Liberty Bonds.
