Mud marrs contests

Bongs edge SPE’ S in flickerbalt

Burcka, it is official: Bongs
over the SPE’s, 19-12.

The card was muddy: and
late. But that is okay.

This week we have a pile of
cards from teams we know
nothing about. With this kind
of coverage we could write for
the Observer. Move over, Bob

On the first game of our
review (that’s not a test) the
3rd Cannon Frogs croaked the
4-Q’s in a thriller officiated by
the famous Shaburg. This
man has larger mammary
glands than any coed and will
back it up in any face-to-face
competition,

Richardson-2 flamed over a
mystery team, the Diagos,
26-7. The Diagos complained,
since two of their key players
failed to appear (reportedly a
masked man and his mute

“IT decided on track because
I seemed to have some talent
there,’’ Pinckney related.

Indeed he must, for in his
first two years he has already
established himself as one of
Davidson’s finest distance
runners.

As a sophomore he finished
first for Davidson in every
meet in which he participated.
In track, he set school records
in both the three-mile and
six-mile runs. His three-mile
record broke that set by
present track and cross count-
ry coach Sterling Martin in the
early 60’s.

Pinckney has been disap-
pointed with his performance
so far this season.

“T’ve already had: two bad
races this year, and I hope
that’s all,’’ he said.

“Last weekend was_ the
worst I’ve run since freshman
year. This year I came back to
school in better shape than the
year before. I ran 400 miles in
August alone.”’

Pinckney feels
activities have hurt his run-
ning.

“It’s hard being a_ hall
counselor and trying to run,
too,” he explained. ‘I just
can’t get enough sleep. And I
haven’t been able to get in
many morning runs. It’s been
difficult to establish a pat-
tern.”’

Nevertheless, Pinckney has
done well, finishing.first for
Davidson in two meets and
second in another.

Cole has been a consistent
performer in cross country the
past three years, but has had a
slow start this season.

“I’m disappointed, to say
the least,’’ Cole stated. ‘‘I’ve
never put in this much mileage
before, but I just don’t seem

Because of personal affiliat-
ion, it is difficult for us to
report the next score: Phi
Delt-A over IFT, 13-6.

In a game closer than the
score relates, the ending
played a major part as the

cleanly fought contest as the
powerful Skipo floated dream-

Cole ran 55 to 60 miles a
week this summer, and has
kept that up since returning to
school. He expects to see some
results soon.

‘‘Sometimes things build up
and then you reach a break-
through,”’ he pinted out. “You
just go wild. I’m aiming for a
massive breakthrough.”’

Martin thinks Cole will
reach it.

“He’s in the best shape
ever,’’ he commented, ‘‘and I
expect him to break into the
top five soon.”’
