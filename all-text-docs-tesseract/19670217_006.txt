Dr. Chaliners G. Davidson. di-
rector of the library. took the
student body on a farcical tour
of thé college’s heritage in chap-
él Tuesday, disclosing in narra-
tive and lyrics the previously
“untold stories’’ of the college's
six ‘greatest heroes.”

The usually unresponsive as-
sembly guffawed its approval of
the words and song that David-
son and a supporting cast of six
offered for each hero. starting
with the college’s namesake and
concluding with President D.
Grier Martin.

Davidson introduced each of
the heroes—portrayed by a co-
star from the faculty, adminis-
tration or student body—recall-
ing the familiar and not-so-fa-
milfar contributions of each.

STUDENT AID

White Claims Loans
Better Than Credits

Federally guaranteed loans to
college students have more po-
tential benefit than the tax cred-
ft proposal recently made by
Sen. Abraham Ribicoff (D-
Conn.) according to H. Edmunds
White, director of admissions
and financial aid.

Ribicoff’s proposal, which is
an expanded variation of ones
he has made in past sessions,
gives standardized tax credits
for expenses incurred by parents
in sending their children to col-
lege.

Opposition has been voiced by
national academic associations
on the grounds that families
which are most in need of as-
sistance receive proportionately
less benefit than those which

Alexander noted that current

manity has failed in its attempts
to remove hostility, poverty and

prejudice.

“Nothing seems to exceed our
grasp or feelings.” Alexander
observed, ‘for at long last man
has become the measure of all
things.”

As a result of the failure to
resolve current problems in hu-
man relations, man is, according
to Alexander, ‘‘moving ever clos
er to an abyss of self-destruc-

thought seems to have a disdain
for the Church because its con-
cepts and doctrine of sin were
established long ago when temp-

from what they now are. S

“Unless I am clearly tempt-

‘The Bible asserts that man is
a moral being.”’ Alexander ox-
plained and added that man
must ask himself the question

ers?”

Alexander suggested that as

there was only one basis put

is love.

Quoting from the Scriptures,
Alexander said ‘‘Greater love
hath no man than this, that he
lay down his life for a friend,”
and added “‘this fs what it means

Alexander examined the con-

that this concern is no “‘intru-

but rather it is a “brief encoun-

CIA Link Perplexing
To Opponent Of NSA

By 80B DUNHAM
‘Staff Writer

Joe Beard, one of the chief
proponents of the STOP NASA
movement on campus last year,
is perplexed by the recent an-
nouncement of a financial con-
nection between the National
Student Association and the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency.

“My main reaction is confu-
sion,’' said Beard yesterday. “I
don't want to make any state-
ment before learning what is
going on. Any statement now
would be mere supposition.’

Beard added, “They've spent
so much money on the ‘non-
Communist left’, I wish that they
would give us a few million dol-
lars to help us promote the non-
Communist right."

His comment followed a re-
port earlier this week that the
CIA has been supporting the stu-
dent group with funds for more

than a decade.

The NSA was the center issue
in a controversy on campus last
year, a controversy which re-
sulted in Davidson's withdrawal
from the group, which is con-
sidered the nation's largest stu-
dent group.

Beard commented that he felt
the State Department was wrong
in choosing the NSA as a repre-
sentative. He described the fi-
nancial support as a ‘‘disdainful
use of funds." Along with. this
statement, Beard made a pre-
diction that the NSA would soon
take a major turn to the left.

President Johnson joined the
controversy Wednesday. In a re-
port printed in THE CHAR-
LOTTE OBSERVER, Undersec-
retary of State Nicholas Katzen-
bach commented that “‘the Pres-
ident believes strongly that the
integrity and independence of

the educational community must
be preserved. He has directed a
careful review of any govern-
ment activities that may endan-
ger this integrity and independ-
ence.”

As the reports of the collab-
oration spread. many charges
were added to the original state-
ment. The charge that NSA had
provided student agents in Eu-
rope brought no comment from
Beard, as he held to his view
that the State Department had
erred in choosing the NSA as a
representative.

His basis for his fight against
the student group is the belief
that the group is Communist in-
fluenced. He said, ‘“‘The NSA is
dominated by the Students for
a Democratic Society, a group
which is considered by many
people to be influenced by Com-
munism.”

erect, smoking. Only her face
is turned towards Bill, who
sits with his arms stretched
across the table. He stares at
the empty cigarette box, which
he flips constantly.

Catherine: Don't you just
adore the Ouke? I think he's
the greatest?

Bilt: (looking up. smiling)
He's great all right. but you
should have heard the King-
ston Trio. Now, there’s a cool
bunch of guys! Smooth, man!

Catherine: Oh. YES. I saw
them when they were at Fan-
cy Dress. Remember the one
that played the banjo — the
middle sized one? Bill nods,
he remembers) I think he’s the
cutest thing that I have ever
seen. (Bill smiles) He and
Rock Hudson could have me
anvtime! (Bill laughs)

Bill: Did you see Hudson in
“Torrid.” (shaking head in
amazement) Boy, he was
sharp! Remember that scene
where he and Kim were on
the boat alone? Catherine
smiles, she remembers)
wow!

Catherine: (her face bright
with awakened interest) Did
you see “The Sound and the
Fury’? (Bill nods) What did
you think of it?

Bill; (hesitantly) Well, I
liked it. but it was hard to un-
derstand. I think Faulkner was
trying to say something in that
deaf-mute uncle, but I couldn't
catch it. (grinning) I guess I
should have studied English
more than I did. (obviously he
doesn't believe this)

Catherine: What are you
studying. Bill?

Bill: Pre-med, I guess. I like
chemistry a lot. And besides,
you've got to do something

any meaning. I think being a
doctor is one of the best ways
to, you know, serve your fel-
lowman.

Catherine: (gazing intently
‘at Bill now. her face fairly
glowing with interest) I think
that's terrific, Bill. It's really
great. So many people just
sort of exist. They never seem
to really do anything. I'm glad
you don’t want to be like that.
(The soft strains of ‘‘Tender-
ly’* float through: the haze.)
Bill: (1ising) Let's dance.

# uncrowded portion of the

lance floor. They dance. si-
lently. Bill's eyes are closed.
His expression is that of a
man ascending to Heaven
through clouds of Chanel No.

away from him. and dashes
across the room toward the
exits.)

Catherine: Oh! I can't stand
it! I think I'm going to die!
(Another girl, her face swal-
lowed in a gaping grin, runs
toward Catherine. They meet
and fondly embrace. Bill waits
a moment, irritated. then
walks over to where the two
stand.) Jayne, I want you to
meet my date, Bill Gunch.
Bill, this is Jayne Compson.
(Bill nods acknowledgement;
Jayne gapes) Jayne rooms on -

Jayne) Bill's a Zeta Deke.

Jayne: Oh! Then you must
know Bobby Broadwell. He's
a Zeta Deke down here.

Bill: Yeh, real well. He and
I date together sometimes.
Where did you meet Bobby?

Jayne: Oh, he’s from my
home town -- Petersburg.
(pause, Jayne's eyes dart
nervously between Bill and
Catherine. who only stares
expectantly.) Well, I'd better
find my date before he leaves
me. (She has a shallow laugh).
Catherine, you be sure to come
down to my room in the morn-
ing. O. K.? (Catherine rods
assurance Jayne turns to
leave). Don’t ya'll do anything
I wouldn't. (She winks at Bill.)

friends—and plenty sharp.

ever, the questionnaires which
have been returned seem to in-
dicate that some professors
would still like to continue Open
House on Sunday even though
there is not much student inter-
est."

He also added that ‘there is
much discussion that we are up-
holding a dying tradition. In the
past students would go to the
faculty homes directly after Ves-
pers. Now, without Vespers, stu-
dents do not seem to care as
much as they used to.”

During the first semester the
Religious Life Committee insti-
tuted a policy of individual visi-
tation. Under this plan a faculty
member could ask students at
his discretion.

“The questionnaire,’”’ Watson
said, ‘‘asked whether or not they
favored the open house system.
If so, they could say if they pre-
ferred individual visitation, a pe-
riodic plan of each professor
having open house once a.month.
or a combination of both. If they
did not want to participate, they
did not have to return the let-
ter.”

“We will have the results,
hopefully, in a week,’’ Watson
concluded. An evaluation of the
faculty opinion will be made as
soon as possible. The polling
committee will also try to get
the opinion of the students.
