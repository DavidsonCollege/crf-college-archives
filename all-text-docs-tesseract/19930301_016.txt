MEMORANDUM OF SUPPORT

Without the knowledge or consent of Athletic Director Terry Holland, we the undersigned
wish to express our strong support for him. The personal nature of the:attack on him by
the faculty resolution does the faculty great disservice. We work with this man closely
every day, and frankly find the charges of "sexist" and "“money-grubbing" to be completely
ludicrous. Terry Holland is an honorable man of unquestioned integrity. Therefore we
reject the resolution of the faculty as unwarrented and unjust.

Women's Hoops Ends
the Season With a Win

Seniors Roos, Plowright Honored at
Last Home Game as Davidson Students

By Brett Hayford

The women’s basketball team
returned home Friday to play host
to the UNC-Asheville Bulldogs in
which Jennifer Roos and Jennifer
Plowright were honored as they
played their final game at Davidson
College.

The lady hoopsters had just
come off of a tough loss to Francis
Marion last Sunday and were out
to finish the season with a victory.
Prior to the game, Roos and
Plowright were honored with their
parents at midcourt as the rest of
the team and the fans thanked them
for their great leadership and their
help in restoring women’s basket-
ball back to the varsity level at
Davidson.

The game began with both
teams shooting poorly. It was evi-
dent that the emerging star of the
game would be Erin Butcher as she
quickly began to dominate inside
with strong rebounding and fol-
low-up shooting.

UNC-Asheville (Division 1,

|-Big South Conference Member)

held their ground as halftime ap-
proached.

The lady Cats’ took a 28-22
lead into the locker room and
Butcher led all players at the break
with 13 points and 10 boards.

The second half consisted of
much the same type of play as
Maggie Young stepped up with a
big three pointer and finished with
11 points.

The Cats’ took a ten point lead
three minutes into the second half
and they never looked back as ev-
ery player was able to get some
action in the game as Davidson
defeated UNC-Asheville 59-49.
Erin Butcher finished with 27
points and 14 rebounds as she fin-
ished an outstanding freshman
campaign with another tremendous
outing.

It was a fitting way to end a
impressive first season of varsity
girls basketball as they finished
with a respectable 9-13 record.

A greatamountof thanks goes
to Jennifer Plowright and Jennifer
Roos as well as the rest of the team
and Coach Filar as they will al-
ways be remembered for bringing
women’s basketball back to
Davidson.

It has indeed been a pleasure
seeing the women practicing each
night of the week, as well as hav-
ing the opportunity to again see the
women in red and black. Hope-
fully, only more good seasons will
come.

Davidson is no longer a suitcase

student, if humanly possible, would
be outta here. Male and female
dates may come from other schools
now, but life here is more com-

plete, thanks in large part to coedu-
cation.

Single-sex clubs and schools

have their place, but I think acom-
bination of coeducation and some
of the custioms of old Davidson
‘would make the college even bet-
| ter today, though not the chicken-
eating wildcat or the sweating,
class-scheduled exams. Inconsid-

ering the serious side of education
for women and men at this school,
my mind returned to my interviews
the two times I was hired here, in
1961 and 1967. Teaching was the
word both times. In later years, the
word service and publishing were
added. We always thought teach-
ing was service. As for the second,
the tenure driven publication of
unripe scholarship along with so-
called “merit raises” is the infec-
tion which has led to the headcold

of self-promotion at many schools
across the nation. The current
Davidson policy is that raises are
determined solely on the basis of
“merit.” This is a 180 degree shift
from earlier school policy. Need-
less to say, there is disagreement
over the term merit when ft comes
to publishing and teaching loads.
When we fret over the national
standing of the college and our
professional advancement as indi-
viduals, the condition worsens, and
we may even run a low profes-
sional fever. What does this have
to do with coeducaton? Nothing
directly. It does mean that
untenured faculty members, female
and male alike, are perplexed.
When I asked a colleague for
her thoughts on the larger picture
of coeducation and women on the
faculty at Davidson, she said some-

thing that applies to the men as
well: “There is less than perfect
agreement among women col-
leagues over the criteria of profes-
sionalism, faculty citizenship and
collegiality” in our college. We
went on to talk about married
couples with tenure, a possibility
more likely at a coeducational
school. Mightnota sensible spouse
come on board for less, save the
college money, and depress the
salary scale? Is this a legitimate
subject for discussion at Davidson?
Nothing personal, friends.

is a professor of English. He
received his tenure in 1972, the
year the Trustees approved
coeducation.
