Problem Child?

The South is quite frequently called the
“problem child” of the nation. Since Presi-
dent Roosevelt’s National Emergency Coun-
cil released its report concerning the eco-
nomic condition of the South, the nation as
aewhole has been scratching its head, mak-
ing a lot of speeches, and writing a great
deal about the ‘situation, but few head-
scratchers, orators, or writers have offered
practical suggestions for a solution to the
problem confronting us. Very little study,
comparatively speaking, has been given to
increasing the number and volume of Sou-
thern products which have a reasonable
chance of finding markets.

The per capita income of the South is
lower than that of any other section of the
country ; but, according to eminent econom-

| ists all this talk about share-cropper abuses
and exploitation in general is not the real
problem, since if all income in the South
were divided equally the per capita appor-
tionment would still be very low. At the
present time the income just isn’t there to
increase per capita. Then what is the an-

dividing up the small income it does have.

This increase in total income must come

about in two ways: we must develop new
sources and new industries and find markets

for them, and educate our growing popula-

tion to meet this change in economy.
The South has a greater population in-

crease than any other section of the country,

Elmira, N. Y.—ACP)—The old-

own again at Elmira College.

A professor of English is requir-
ing his students to keep a daily
journal to stimulate their individual
natural styles of prose writing. He
has found that it aids them in de-
stroying the stiff, self-consciousness,
false literary style they use in writ-

HAZE DAYS ... Sometime ago
we told you some of the pranks the
undergrads used to enjoy at Hal-
lowe'en, back in the Good Old’ Days.
Naturally the same boys didn’t
just sit around and let things stag-
nate for the rest of the year. They
went in for a high grade of hazing
and general cutting-up in the off
seasons too.

name

Here is one of the best hazing
stories we've come across lately.
It’s presumably authentic, too,
since it comes indirectly from Mr.
T. M. Griffith, Mayor of Davidson,
who was speaking of his own days
here. There was, is seems (as often
is), a certain bullying, swaggering
freshman who became pretty ob-
noxious to upperclassmen. So, aft-
er contriving a sufficiently diabolical
plot, several strapping sophs drag-
ged the victim from his hole in
Rumpléone dark night. With ter-
rible solemnity they carried the
frosh across town, down to the
railroad track. Quickly they spread-
eagled the struggling boy over the
tracks. Then they tied him and left.

In a few moments the north-
bound train could be heard thrund-
ering along the rails in the distance,
the frosh’s fear skyrocketed; he
screamed; he yelled. Suddenly the
beam of the locomotive’s headlight
played on his prostrate form as the
engine lurched around the curve.
There was a terrified shriek; the
cars lurched on—and by. He had
been tied to a siding just a yard
or so out of danger.

Happy ending: the victim was
a model freshman thereafter.
