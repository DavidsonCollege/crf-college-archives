CHARLOTTE GAME.

Davidson defeated the Charlotte Y.
M. C. A, last Friday night in a fast and
interesting game of basket ball, 50 to 33.
Davidson had their opponents outclass-
ed in the first half, but Charlotte came
back strong in the second and put up a
snappy game.

For Davidson it would be difficult to
say who starred. The whole team
played an excellent game. Childs, at
forward, played a wonderful game, scor-
ing 16 points in the first half. Reese
also played a fast game, scoring
points. Hengeveld also kept up his
good work at center, adding 12 to the
score, °
The locals played a better game ‘than
they had previously done at Davidson.

Dr. McMillan Speaks on Home
Missions---The Classes.

On last Thursday evening the Y. M.
C. A. members had an unusual treat in
having with them as the speaker for the
evening, Dr. Homer McMillan. His
visit and talk were all the more appreci-
ated because of the fact that he had
made a special trip up from Atlanta
just, to be at Davidson for this occasion.
The nature of his address was a plea
for Home Mission workers.

“Lift up your eyes and look out upon
the fields, white and ready for the
harvest.” Dr. McMillan quoted these
words of the Master which He had ad-
dressed to His apostles, intending that
they should see the situation, then know
it, and finally go. His inspiration would
lead to their information and thence to
their oblogation.

Dr. McMillan continued his talk by
a discussion of the Home Mission work
as viewed from three angles: (1) It
Field, (2) Its Foes. and (3) Its Fruits.

In the first place, situated in a coun
trv with an area of three and one-half
million square miles, centrally located
wherein now- rests the seat of power of

dominate the world; whose present
population exceeds 103,000,000 of
people, and at the present rate of in-
crease will pass the 500,000,000 mark
before the close of this century—where
indeed could we find a better mission
field? With more than 60,000,000 of
our own people in no wise connected
with the church, for less than 38 per
cent have any relations with it what-
ever. he pointed out the opportunity for
mission work among those millions still

An even while the church waits, the
enemy is watching. The Morman

its kind and having the hest organized
mission force in the world; the false
faces from the Orient; Romanism, for
the Catholic church now has over 15,-

alone and has grown twice as fast as the
Protestant in recent years; mainly thru

Sophs and Juniors, ‘The teams taken
both collectively and individually have
heen practicing faithfully for the last
few days, and are getting in shape for
the annual mix-up. |

The Senior team, with “Billy” Savad
as manager, “Bill” Keesler as captain
and “Sam” Keesler coaching, has been
going thre light drill practice; and have
had no hard work yet. They are in fine
trim as a large number of the players
have been in the game before.

credit in the oncoming strucele.

| The Fresh team. with Manager Fl

DR. MARTIN RETURNS
FROM INTERESTING TRIP

"Vo a reporter, Dr. Martin gave an
outline of his tour of some Northern
cities, He first stopped in) Cincinnati,
where he went out to the University of
Cincinnati. Vhere Dr. Williams, physi-
cal director of the institution, went over
their gevmnasium with him. The next
three or four davs were spent in Chicaro
in attendance at the Canvention of the °
Association of American Colleges. There
were about two hundred members pres-
ent and the meetings were held in’ the

La Salle Hotel.

On Saturday afternoon of the 13th
he went out to Whiting, Ind.. where he
visiled Dr. Fo M. Rogers, '03. Fle i
chief chemist of the refining plant of the
Standard Oil Co.. one of the largest of
its kind in the United States.

The following Monday he left Chi-
cago for New Yatk, where he spent
two days, one dav of which was devoted
to discussion of plans for the gymnasium.
Mr. Smallwood, 'o6, is the architect.
There he found the plans practically
complete, but same few modifications
were nade. Dr. Martin is very much
nleased with the plans and says that
this will be one of the best appointed
college gyms he ever saw. In New York
he went to the West End Y. M. C. A.
and investigated the method to purify
rool water by the violet ray svstem. He
thinks that this is a good method and
hopes to adopt it here when the nool is
put in. The plans were promised to he
delivered this week. Then it will be
necessary for the Executive Committee
to pass upon them. As soon as the
weather permits the work will be pust:-
ed as rapidly as possible.

While in New York he saw Francis
L, Fuller, with headquarters on Broad-
wav, who is chief counsel for the Tig-
mett & Mvers Tohacern Co. Mr. Fuller
is very much interested in the coltege.
Fridav was spent in Washington, when
evervthing was being put in nreparation
for the funeral of Admiral Dewey.
