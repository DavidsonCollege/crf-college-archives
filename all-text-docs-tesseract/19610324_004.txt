HIS UNIQUE PERSONALITY and unique appearance made
Prof. C. R. Harding an unforgettable figure in Davidson tradition.
He had 2 piercing eye, an infectious laugh, and en insatiable
intellectual curiosity. He was never content to stay in a rut or
contine his mind to those channels approved by more conserve
tive men.

The Ladies Saw More
Than Peach Trees

By ED RUDERT
Davidsonian Feature Writer

An institution, a legend, a part of Davidson is
“Dickie” Harding.

Caleb Richmond Harding first
came to Davidson College in
1876, intent. on becoming a
Presbyterian minister. In 1888
he came back as professor of
Greek and German. In 1949
Dr. Harding. professor emeritus,
died at Davidson.

A janitor once said to Dr. Lin-
gle, former president of the col-
lége, of Harding: ‘Looks like de
Lawd. gone hafta retire dat man;
we done all WE can."

No one can be a part of a
college for over 50 years. with-
out. becoming legendary. Among
the generation of the faculty to-
day who were taught by and
who taught with Dr. Harding,
he is remembered as one of the
best-loved men who has ever
been here. one whose memory
still brings enjoyment and often
laughter.

At a place like a college camp-
us, rumors can easily become
attached to a popular individ-

Council Passes
First New By-law

Monday night the Student
Council passed the first new by-
law to be added to the revised
constitution. The by-law, which
is now Section Nine of the Stu-
dent Body by-laws, reads, ‘No
student shall be a member of
both the Student Council and
the Honor Court.”

This makes up for an article
overlooked when the revised
constitution was drawn up.

The councj!l also requested
the administration to investigate
the possibility of installing fire
sirens in the dormitories. After
the search of rooms conducted
by the Honor Court one night
last semester, the council rea-
lized the difficulties anyone
would have in waking people
in the event of a fire in one of
the dorms.

Student Body President Henry
Shue reported to the council on.
the activities of the Congolese
Student Committee, and in lieu
of further business, the meeting
was adjourned.

ual. Thus. it is impossible to
tell which of the many stories
which have grown up around
Dr. Harding are true. Whether
factual or legendary, they are
in keeping with the character of
“Dickie Harding” or they would-
n't have been told in the first
place.

HEAD OUT WINDOW

One of the most popular of
the stories concerns Dr. Hard-
ing and his old car, which he
drove with his head out the win-
dow because the windshield was
always either too eracked or
dirty to see through.

When told by a policeman on
a busy Charlotte intersection
that hé couldn’t make the turn
he was going into, Dr. Harding
Said. ‘ Well, young man, if you
will get out of the way I think
I can,” and completed his turn.

Then there was the time that
he called the famous Mr. Duke
aside to complain about the
evils of smoking among the
students. when Duke was on the
campus arranging a donation of
$2.000.000, made mostly by his
tobaceo imdustry.

VICTORIAN IDEAS

Some of Dr. Harding’s rather
Victorian ideas showed up in
the fine arts class he taught in
his latter years. He never show-
ed male and female Greek sta-.
tues on the same day.

Particularly revealing pic-
tures would often be folded,
showing the top third or so, in
order to be modestly displayed
to the students.

A NIGHTSHIRT

For some reason it was a well
known fact around campus that
Dr. Harding slept in a night-
shirt. This fact most likely in-
spired the following story: One
day when Dr. Harding was at
home sick in bed, Mrs. Harding
had the ladies of her mission-
ary society at the house.

She told her husband that she}
would have to bring the ladies
through the bedroom to take
them out back to see her peach
trees. She finally convinced
him that he could simply pull’
the sheet up over his head and,
they wouldn't even notice his
presence. In the excitement of
his wife's warning of their ap-
proach, the professor absent-
mindedly grabbed the end of his
night-shirt and pulled IT up
over his head.

Quips And Cranks
Is ‘Revolutionary’

“Revolutionarily different” is
the best term to describe this
year’s Quips and Cranks accord:
ing to Executive Editor Bobby
James. The annual will be a-
vailable to the Davidson stu-
dent body about May 15.

The annual staff has almost
finished its work, and the last
material will go out this week.
The Charlotte Engraving Com-
pany will do the engraving, and
The Observer Printing House
will print the annual.

Quips and Cranks will be so
different this year that the staff
intends to send copies to dif-
erent publishers, critics, and
other campuses for criticism and
comment before it comes out
on the Davidson campus.

“The insights of these out-
side sources may help student
insight and will aid the annual
staff to choose methods to pub-
licize effectively the new ap-
proach taken in this yearbook,”
James said.

“The student body should ap-
proach the new Quips and
Cranks as far more than just
another annual, whether or not
it is a success or a failure,”
he commented.

James stressed the fact that
after the views of the outside
sources are obtained, THE DA-
VIDSONIAN will be given more
information as to the annual’s
contents.
