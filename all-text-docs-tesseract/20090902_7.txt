Discrimination

at Davidson:

Stupid People are People, ‘Too

Despite over 100 years of
criticism, it appears that Davidson
College will continue its con-
troversial discrimination policy
against stupid people.

Byron McClue is a human
rights activist on the Davidson
campus, where he is on the board
of the Foundation for the Young,
Oppressed, and Underprivileged
(F YOU). In recent years, Byron
and F YOU have lobbied the cause
of the stupid and have called atten-
tion to their plight.

Idiots like these have virtually no

chance of attending Davidson

“In my thirteen years at David-
son, the college has admitted over
27,000 students, only fifty-eight
of which were stupid,” said Mc-
Clue. “When you compare this to
the number of stupid people in the
population, you realize how horri-
bly prejudiced we have become. If
Davidson wants to prepare its stu-
dents for the real world, it had bet-
ter give this issue some thought,”
said McClue.

The integration will no doubt
be a difficult process. According
to F YOU data, the only way for
Davidson to reach the desired
quota of stupid people in next
year’s freshman class is to active-
ly recruit them from historically
stupid areas.

“Stupid people have stupid
children and breed a culture where
the smart schools are never a con-
sideration. I’m afraid the majority
of stupid people are too dumb to
apply,” said McClue.

Of course, some stupid
people are stupid enough to ap-
ply anyway. But these idiots are
not enough to make a real dif-
ference.

It is now widely recog-
nized that because of the harsh
discriminatory atmosphere at
Davidson and other comparable
institutions, stupid people are
being forced to attend less pres-

tigious and, in some cases, lower
quality institutions.

Another recent study showed
that stupid people received 24
cents to the smart person’s dollar,
and were 73% less likely to be
hired than their smart counter-
parts.

“This is the very essence of
discrimination,” said McClue. “T
am looking for some upstanding
Americans who are stupid enough
to do something about it.”

Concert Confusion Stuns
Wall-E, Pixar Enthusiasts

Duke Performance Hall—Last
week entertainer Wale graced the
campus of Davidson College with
his presence and thrilled a capacity
crowd with his hip hop perfor-
mance. While the majority of the
audience had intended to see the
DC rapper, a small group of stu-
dents had very different expecta-
tions for their Saturday night.

“We were under the impression
that the Union Board was premier-
ing the double disc Bluray edition
of the Disney/Pixar entertainment
motion picture ‘Wall-E,’” said The
Animation and Technology Club
President Emie Snead. “My kid
sister was in town. I thought she
might like to see a night of good
clean fun. Instead we were hit
with barrage of lyrics about loose
women and expensive sneakers. I
was very disappointed to say the
least.”

Foul-mouthed rapper Wale

appalled Davidson's tamer students

Snead and the Animation Club
arrived very early on Saturday
to secure front row seats. They
had heard that the show was sold
out. “Naturally we assumed that
everyone was excited to see some
digital shenanigans in HD,” Snead
explained. “When the rapper came
on stage we figured it was Pixar
unveiling their new technology. It

The Freshman’s First Time

THe Davipsonia

Hundreds of
Davidson freshmen
and their parents
flooded campus
last weekend as
move-in day fi-
nally arrived and
orientation com-
menced.

“Cramming
your junk inside

always a pleasurable
experience,” said President Tom
Ross in a speech to the frosh.
“You’re going in and out and up
and down for several hours at a
time. It’s definitely a workout! I
broke a good sweat my first time
too.”

“|... broke a good
sweat my first time
too!”

“When my son came for the
first time and told me, ‘I love
this!’” said one freshman mother,
“T knew he would want to come
here for four years. It is such a
warm, comfortable environment,
although he noted it was a little
damp — we’re not used to the hu-
midity down here!”

“Mikey and his father strug-
gled for hours on the bed,” said
another mother. “Those two boys
just could not get those poles
into the darn holes! We actually
had to ask for some new poles,
because the ones we had were
too skinny. They just wobbled
around and then fell right out!
But fortunately I’ve spent a lot of
time exhausting myself on beds
in my career, so I was glad to be

looked so realistic! Then one of
the members of his posse poured a
40 oz. malt liquor beverage on my
sister. ”

A Union Board spokesperson
said “I thought after last spring
when all the Star Wars nerds
showed up for the RJD2 concert
we wouldn’t have any more confu-
sion like this. Apparently not. We
will send numerous emails to all
Econ Majors and the Davidson In-
vestment and Finance association
if we book 50 Cent for the spring
concert.”

Snead said this incident still
paled in comparison to the time
when he thought he was going to
‘A Bug’s Life’ but walked into the
theater premiering ‘8 Mile’ ac-
cidently.

“That was an experience. I
watched it anyway because I was
afraid I'd get shot for leaving.”

But we kept going at it.”

The busy week concluded
with an ice-cream social in the
Union. Five hundred teenagers
wrestled with each other be the
first to receive a delicious treat
from Georgia Ringle, Chester,
John, and Sharon.

“I want lots of whipped
cream on mine!” the newbies
were heard to shout. “And top it
off with a cherry!”

We interviewed freshman
Logan Senken, who struggled
to talk through a mouthful of
goodies.

“At first I couldn’t even fit
my mouth around it!” she ex-
claimed, gesturing at her over-
sized cone. “But once I licked
around the edges to stop it from
dripping, it got much smaller
and was easier to enjoy.”

Freshmen, it feels wonderful
to finally have you. The David-
son community is eager to open
up and welcome you inside!

Davidson Students
Catch More Than
Hangover at “F”’

~ Yn an unusual display of fore-
sight and keen policy-making,
what is arguably the most-
frequented residence building on
the campus has been modified to
house dangerously contagious in-
dividuals.

“Beirut” or “beerpong,” one
of the most popular neighborhood
activities at F, involves communal
cups and ingestion of immune
system-hindering fluids. Swine flu,
coincidentally, “may be transmit-
ted by touching something with fi
viruses on it and then touching the
mouth or nose.”

Davidson College assures its
student body that the quarantine
zones are additional “safety mea-
sures.” No official statement has
been issued regarding the mustard
gas in the Outpost bathrooms, or
the general health hazard that is
the Tomlinson kitchenette.
