New court?
Students express
mixed feelings after
first party weekend

By ANN HATFIELD
Staff Writer

After fierce debate last semes-
ter, Davidson trustees enacted a
no- keg policy that many students
feel jeopardizes the cohesion of
the Court. This weekend, that
policy was tested for the first time.

Due to matters of liability,
Davidson's self-study argued two
years ago that the new “no com-
mon container” policy was long
overdue and pointed out that na-
tional fraternities banned the use
of kegs over ten years ago. —

The new policy approved by
the trustees last spring mandates
that there be no more than 25 cases
of beer at any organization sup-
plied event, and all beer must be in
the form of cans. At combination
events (those sponsored by mul-
tiple social organizations), “the or-
ganization may supply a quantity
based upon nine beers per member
of legal drinking age or 15 cases,
whichever is less.”” Non-members
may bring ap to nine beers per
person.

This past Friday night, Connor
and Phi Delta Theta held the first
BYOB party. .

Guests checked with IDers at
the front door‘and 21 year-olds
received wrist bands. 21 year old
guests could then take their beer to
the basement where it was placed
in a labelled bin. :

Each 21 year-old who brought
beer was given a card indicating
the amount of beer brought and the
bin where it was deposited.

dred colleges and universities
across the U.S in the next three
years were announced by the
United States Military in May,

_ 1995. According to Lt.. Kevin

Colcord, Professor of Military Sci-
ence for the ROTC program at
Davidson,the decision stems from
the Military’s lower requirement
for officers due to the ending of the
Cold War.

Inthe past 12 years, 144 offic-
ers have graduated from Davidson

for an average of 12 graduating
officers each year. The Army is
closing schools with less than 15
officers graduating each year.

“The quality of ROTC cadets
produced by Davidson is remark-
able, but essentially our numbers
make the Army consider us for
closure,” said Colcord.

The 45 Davidson students di-
rectly affected by the ROTC’ sclos-
ing face a decision to attend mili-
tary classes at the University of

North Carolina-Charlotte (UNCC)
while continuing their education at
Davidson or to leave the ROTC
program. If a participant attends
UNCC, their ROTC scholarship to
Davidson would not be in danger.
In addition, ten $20,000 scholar-
ships are offered each year through
a government program that will
continue at Davidson even without
an ROTC progaram on campus.
Sophomore Daniel Cantey,
who has been involved with ROTC

for two years, said he is very disap-
pointed with the ending of the pro-
gram. “I wish ROTC peaked more
students’ interests,” said Cantey.
“The military offers so much to
people — such as travel and train-
ing for the business world.”
Sophomore Josh Glazer is
also dissapointed in the turn of
events,
“ ROTC also offers a chance
toenterthe military at officer level,”
he said.

Presidential

search continues

With President Kuykendall
rounding out his last term in office
this year, the Presidential Search
Committee has been hard at work.
Trustee Larry Dagenhart, chair of
the committee, says that active re-
cruitment began in May.

He notes that Davidson’s pres-
tige has “elicited many direct in-
quiries,” which should ensure a
competitive applicant pool. On Au-

_ gust21stthe search committee met

to discuss interviews i in Septem-
ber." st
Dagenhart anticipates meet-
ings with the most qualified appli-
cants in October and may ask “‘out-
standing” candidates for campus
visits in November. The commit-
tee wants to find its president-elect
as early as possible to allow ample
time for acclimation to Davidson.

The fall of Back Street: restaurant to become “Jasper’s”
Back Street bosses go back to basics; boisterous bistro bets on bigger budgets

By Ranpy HARTWELL
Associate News Editor

On June 22, 1996, the Char-

. lotte Observer paid tribute to the

passing of 19 individuals in its
“Death Notices” section. But it
didn’t notice the death of one of
Davidson’s most cherished land-
marks the previous day: Back Street
Café died on June 21.

Owners Rick and Kathy

Bryant say that six years of run-—

ning the neighborhood bar and res-
taurant had taken their toll. "We've
got a little girl, and it was just
taking a lot of time away from our
family," says Rick Bryant.

The Bryants put Back Street
on the market in the spring, and by
June had entered into negotiations
with Robert and Diana Metzler,
parents of Chad Metzler '98. In-
vestors from Cleveland, the
Metzlers had been looking at prop-

Crue: for restaurant Revernpaiens

in the Davidson area. When their
friends at the Davidson Inn in-
formed them of the Bryants’ wish
to sell, the Metzlers gave them an
offer. “They wanted to:sell it, and
he was looking for a place,” said
Chad of his father.

Rick Bryant says that with the
Metzlers' track record, they have
reason to be confident. "But they
need to know that this is North
Carolina, and things don't happen
so fast here," he cautions. "We
wish them all the luck in the world

.. but it won't be your local tav-
ern."

In keeping with a trend in the
other few blocks of the Davidson
downtown area, the Metzlers plan
a cleaner, spruced-up incarnation
of the property on Depot Street.
“Tt’ll be nice, but not really fancy,”
said Chad. “They’ll have steaks
and pasta at dinner, and sandwiches
at lunchtime. It won’t cost any
more than Lone Star or Kobe. It'll

be a nice place for a date, and there
will still be a bar.”

The restaurant and bar, which
is to be named “Jasper’s” after
Chad’s great-grandfather, will be
run by his uncle, Dahl Metzler, a
restaurant manager.

The restaurant is slated to-

open in September or October. The
interior has been “gutted, and
they’re re-doing the brick work

Chad. Jasper’s is even “trying to
work out a deal so students can use
their Cat Cards there,” he said.

Students will miss Back Street,
however. “I had been a regular
since I was a freshman,” says Eddie
Gordon ’96, who tended bar there
for over a year. “I’m just glad I got
to enjoy it while I could.”

"Davidson's been good to us,"
says Rick Bryant. "We'll really
miss it.”
