Date For Room Drawings
Still Under Postponement

After almost a month-long
postponement, there has still
been no definite date set for
drawings for. rooms in the
dormitories next year.

According to Mrs. ‘Scottie
Nicholls, dérector of. stu
dent housing, the college ad-
ministration has asked her
not to proceed with room

drawing until there is a rea*

sonable degree of assurance
that there will be full occup-
ancy in the dorms.

“IT know of no other season
for the delay than the ad
ministration’s interest in full
occupancy,” she said. ‘'This
is rightfully so, since the col-
lege does need the money.

“This really is no change
in policy, for we've always
wanted to fill as many spaces
in the dorms as we could
since empty spaces _ lose
money for the college.”

Actually, Mrs. Nicholls em-
phasized, the current stress
to fill all possible dormitory
space is ‘‘off-center, because
we have always Had all the
beds filled in the fall. This
past‘ fall is the only excep
tion.”

Mrs. Nicholls said — that
this past fall saw 32 students
who had sig: ed ud to Hve in
the dorms either teave’ Da

during the summer.

“This has always been my
aim, though, and except for

‘Mrs. Nicholls said.

Mrs. Nicholls had tenta-
tively planned to hold the
room drawing on Monday
through Thursday of next
week, but was requested by
Dean of Students Will H. Ter-
ry to put it off: for a short
while longer.

“Now I’m working on the
possibility that the drawing
might be held on the week
of May 17, but that’s not a
definite date,’ Mrs. Nicholls
said. “T’vee been told not to
do anything about room
assignments until the admin-
istration gives me the go-

ahead.”

BEHIND THE SCENE

The backdrop receives finishing touch,

such as summer marriages,
the attrition rate, and so on.

“Ive been assured 315
freshmen will be here next
year to fill the dorm space
now reserved,’’ she said.

East, Cannon, and Watts
have been reserved for next
year's freshmen class al-
ready.

Presently the first two
floors of Watts are occupied
by upperclassmen, but the
whole dorm wiil be filled
with freshmen next year.
East and Cannon have been
freshman dormitories for
several years.

“Traditionally I never have
enough rooms as drawing
time, so I have to account
for dorm drop-outs over the
summer,"’ Mrs. Nichols said,

FED UP WITH WAR
Peter Michael explains his reasons for fasting.

‘Student Group Conducts

Three Day Fast For Peace

While peace protesters
were arrested in record
numbers in Washington this
week, Davidson students
demonstrated their support
through passive activity~ on
campus Monday , Tuesday
and Wednesday.

The Davidson Peace Coali-
tion initiated a three-day fast

arce’

hicle for the particular
talents of George Draughon.
As Babs and as Charley's
bogus ‘‘aunt’’, his comedy
timing is precise. His facial
asides. and use of personal
effects (watch that gaudy
fan) alone could carry arly
number of scenes.

Peter Lutken and Ken
Jones are equally adept as
Babs’ classmates. Jones’
lovesick stares and [utken’s
characteristically brisk and
superbly timed movements
are outstanding.

Their counterparts, the
young woman of the plot
are Cathy Ross and Martha
Plott. The girls are perhaps
not consistently as sugary
sweet and likeable as one
might have them, but their
duet movements (mirrored
and simultaneous steps and
glances) are some of the
finest touches in the show.

Dave Bradley and. Scottie
Nicholls are convincing as
Jack's (Lutken) father and
the rea) aunt. Bradley in
particular serves a8 a neces-
sary, effective, and welcome
anchor for the cast’s antics
—by means of his relatively
straight approach to his part.

Cullum Rogers and Tim
Timmons regularly delight
audience in their handling of
two more-or-less character
roles. Rogers, especially
works well with comedy tim-
ing and stage movements.
Timmons produces one of the
show’s most original charac-
ters, and gets laudable
comedy mileage from some
dry Well Made Play exposi-
tion.

to demonstrate support for
those in Washington and to

commemorate last — year’s

killings at Kent State and
Jackson State Universities.
Other activity during the

week included the coalition's
vigil across the street from
the post office on Tuesday
and a sit-in organized by. in-
ternational student Ken
Ozeki on Monday.

Spokesmen for the coalition
placed the number of those
fasting between 15 and 20
with many wearing
black arm bands to. signify
their) sympathy. The total
number of fasters was well
below the figures from. last
spring’s fast.

The vigil lasted from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m. with an hour of
silence observed from noon
to 1 p.m. The numbers were

others

. ticipants,

sparse with one to eight stu-
dents maintaining the vigil.

The vigil was planned aé a
memorial to the four — stu-
dents killed by Ohio National
Guardsmen last spring at
Kent State. The names of the
four were written on crosses
and, along with a banner,
made the backdrop for the
vigil.

Ozeki’s sit-in in the’ main
hall of Chambers attracted

In four posters
Ozeki made his appeal for
the legal, non-violent protest
of the Vietnam war and sup-
port of those in Washington.

The number of demonstra-
lors in the Monday morning
sit-in ranged as high as 15-20
with several administrators
and faculty members joining
in.
