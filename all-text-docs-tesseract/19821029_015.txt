‘(My Favorite Year [1982—It’s 1954
in the movie] produced by Mel
Brooks [yes—him again]; Directed
by Richard Benjamin; starring Peter
O’Toole, Mark Linn-Baker, Jessica
Harper, Lainie Kazan, and Selma
Diamond) Rating: **** Viewer’s
guide: PG, profanity, adult situations

My Favorite Year, playing at the
Southpark Cinema in Charlotte, is my
favorite movie for 1982. It’s a con-
sistently funny, often touching look at
live television in the 1950s. Peter
O’Toole as alcohol / sex-drenched
matinee idol Alan Swann gives the
performance of his career, and the
supporting cast ain’t bad either. Lain-
ie Kazan is most notable (and out-
rageous) as a Shelly Winters-Jewish
mother.

The plot centers around the efforts

of comedy writer Benjy Stone (really
Steinberg—he changed it to get work)
to keep Allan Swann, an Errol Flynn-
esque swashbuckler, sober long
enough to make an appearance on the
TV show for which he writes,
“Comedy Cavalcade” (a perfect im-
itation of that classic ’50s comedy
program “Your Show of Shows”).

However, as the movie hilariously
proves, this ic not humanly possible.

Director Richard Benjamin has a
perfect feel for the "50s atmosphere as
well as My Favorite Year’s subject
matter. He takes this already clever
comedy and gives it a big does of hu-
manity, somehow avoiding the sy-
rupy sentimentality one has come to
expect in a film like this. A beautiful
moment comes when Swann goes to

visit his obviously illegitimate daugh- -

ter (whom he hasn’t seen in a year)
but can’t get up the courage to get out
of the car and talk with her. It’s a
hauntingly effective moment. By the
end of MFY, the viewer can safely say
he likes Alan Swann and yes, even
understands him, amid all his booze
and women.

Peter O’Toole’s brilliant perfor-
mance (which I’ll get to later) should
not overshadow the equally fantastic
supporting cast. The supporting play-
ers seem to have been born into their
roles. Mark Linn-Baker (a Broadway
performer—this his first Hollywood
role) is perfect as the naive but world-
ly Benjy, Jessica Harper is funny as
his bubbly girlfriend, and of course
there’s Lainie Kazan. This is opera
singer Kazan’s first try at film, and let
us all pray it is not her last. She is
downright hysterical as Benjy’s
mom, trying to be sexy, motherly,
and wise all at the same time.

After seeing MFY, one is tempted
to say Peter O’Toole is the greatest
actor alive. If O’ Toole doesn’t win an
Oscar this year for MFY, I will per-
sonaliy disavow the entire Academy
organization. They have already stol-
en this prize from him three times:
first offense—Lawrence of Arabia
(1962); second offense—The Lion in
Winter (1968); third offense—The
Stunt Man (1980). Let’s nat blow it
this time, guys! Peter O’Toole is a
real-life personification of the exces-
sive Swann, so you won’t have him to
foolishly ignore much longer. (In
fact, it would be wrong not to give My
Favorite Year the Best Picture

award). Gee, with movies like ET.
The Road Warrior, Garp, and now

My Favorite Year, 1982 is shaping up
to be my favorite year for movies.

(Bullitt [1968] directed by Peter
Yates; starring Steve McQueen, Ro-
bert Vaughn, Jacqueline Bisset, and
Simon Oakland) Rating: ***'4
Viewer’s Guide: Violence of a
pretty graphic sort

Bullitt, the chilling crime drama
that put actor Steve McQueen on the
map, is a movie to see. Not only
does it have one of the most incredi-
ble car chases you’ve ever seen on
film, Bullitt also contains Steve
McQueen’s finest performance as a
San Francisco cop who gets in up to
his ravioli in an evil Mafia plot. The
film constantly moves and hits hyp-
er-space in the climactic chase. Di-
rector Peter Yates, not usually
known for his action flicks, takes

‘first chair with Bullitt. Oh, and

there’s also Jacqueline Bisset, way
before she took off into stardom,
and she’s, well, appealing.

X Miss this film at all cost, or better yet catch
a revival showing of “Attack of the Killer Toma-

Oliver! The big movie hit in ’68
(with both the critics and the public)
is liable to please anyoné who likes
musicals. It’s loaded with good
songs: “Consider Yourself,” “As
Long As He Needs Me,” etc.; great
performances: Ron Moody as a
nasty Fagin and charming direction
by veteran Oliver Reed (The Third
Man). Yes, for movie musical lov-
ers, Oliver! is the movie to see.
However, if you are like me and
consider musicals on film inferior to
those on stage, steer clear of Oliver!

Why do I bicker about movie
musicals? Glad you asked. This past
summer, I had a chance to see the
movie Oklahoma! on the tube. |
thought, “Oh goodie! Oklahoma-
!What culture!” Well, I can tell you
I was severely disappointed. So dis-
appointed, in fact, that I proclaimed
Oklahoma! to be witless, phony
Americana. Cut to two months lat-

‘er. A local theater group was putting

on Oklahoma!, and I had two free
tickets and a date (which is unusual
for me). I decided to give it another
try. When I got back from the stage-
production of Oklahoma’, all the
tunes were cheerfully running
around in my head, and I pro-
claimed it to be the greatest thing I’d
ever seen. I’m looking for the sound
track. What’s the difference? Prim-
arily in a stage play, the viewer sus-
pends disbelief and doesn’t care,
and he is indeed pleased when one
of the characters bursts into song.
Not so in movies, where everything
is so incredibly realistic it is impos-
sible (for me, anyway) to keep from
snickering when some tiny kid sings
“Consider Yourself” in the middle
of a ghetto.

But like I said, that’s just me, and
heck, as a movie musical Oliver! ain’t
bad. I’m still a bit peeved, however,
that fine films didn’t get the original
Oliver!, a non-musical starring the
brilliant Alec Guiness. Now that was
a fine film.

Guide: the grossest, most disgust-
ingest, filthiest, and maybe scariest
movie ever made

Hey kids! Amaze your friends!
You too can tell them that you saw
(or survived) Night of the Living
Dead by merely coming to the Big
Screen Room (free popcorn-
—weight watchers don’t worry:
halfway through NOTLD nobody
will be eating anything).

Saturday morning at 1:00! It’s a
real keen movie about these dead
guys who start eating people! They
just eat, eat, eat! Jeepers! They even
munch on pretty Judith O’ Dea! Gee!
