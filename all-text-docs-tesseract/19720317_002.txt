Faculty Views Possible Deficit
With ‘Wait And See’ Attitude

The general reaction of facul-
members to the anticipated
00.000 deficit in this year's
budget is one of “wait and see.”

ome professors said they had

not given the matter much
thought. and there seemed to
be a belef that there was not

going to be a deficit. or it would

not be as bad as the present
“propaganda” put out by the
administration implies.

Ratliff pointed ow that pri-

there was nothing unusual about
Davidson's present plight. and
he said. “I am a bit surprised

budgeted 5 per cent return on
ne endowment.

Kincaid said that a budget re-
turn of 6 per cent on the en-
dowment would make a $70,000
surplus possible, and not a $100,-
000 deficit. An increase of 1 per
cent in the budgeted return on

endowment would mean that Da-

vidson would not have a deficit
for fiscal year 1972, which ends
in June.

n aggressive capital gains
portfolio is the only way for Da-
vidson to survive,’ commented
Kincaid. He pointed out that the
conservative type of bond port-
folio Davidson had until a few
years ago would be mappropri-
ate for Davidson's present needs.

In the latter part of the 1960's
Davidson switched from the
bond portfolio it had tradition-
ally held. Until that time it had
held bonds which usually return-
ed between 3 per cent and 5 per
cent annually

Davidson. today. is pursuing
an aggressive capital gains pol-
icy. Instead of holding bonds,
Dav.dson now owns” mostly
stocks. As an example. this
stock may return 12 per cent
annually—from 2 per cent to 3
per cent in dividends and from
& per cent to 10 per cent In cap-
ital gains (gain in value of the
stock'.

If Davidson's stock has a
three per cent dividend. this is
quite a drop from the five per
cent return previously received
o. bonds. Therefore. Davidson

carnot depend solely on divi-
dends from stock as a meuns of

revenue.

To rectify this. Davidson has
decided to use five per cent of
the value of the endowment for
budget purposes each year. Da-
vidson may have to sell some
of its stock to arrive at this
five per cent figure. but the
value of eact share of stock
will hopefully have increased

so that the endowment is not
eaten away.

Davidson takes the average
value of the endowment for the
past three years as the figure
on which to base its five per
cent return. This method disre-
gards the fact that the value of
the principal may decrease or
increase during the fiscal year
under. consideration.

Kincaid poimted out that Da-
vidson switched from a bond to
a stock portfolio just as the
stock market was entering its
recent difficulties, and this has
hurt Davidson. Nonetheless, this
is a wise policy, and the stock
market is improving, and it
Should continue to do so, ac-
cording to Kincaid. Fiscal year
1973 should be a food vea- ior
Davidson, if present market
trends continue.

“What les beyond freedom
and control?"’ was the question
posed in a speech Tuesday night
by George A. Miller, the Reyn-

olds lecturer, on campus this
week.
Miller, formally president of

the American Psychology Asso-
ciation and presently professor
at Rockefeller University, dealt
with the topic of public concern
over the threat of psychology
to the freedom of the individual.
“My cercern is that psychology
2S criticized on every hand be-
cause it is being incorrectly
viewed as trying to limit free-

dom of individuals.”

The first part of this lecture
dealt with the public's ideas of
contro] and the supposed threat
to freedom. Miller briefly ex-
plored the topics of psychology
which are in the minds of the
public, those of mental testing,
psychotherapy, and control
through feedback. Miller con-
tends that in these areas the
public sees psychology as a
force of control over individ-
uals.

Then, Miller asked, ‘‘What is
it that lies beyond freedom and
control? Problem solving.” He
went on to say, “The goal (of
psychology) is not to control
people; the goal is to solve prob-

gional and class drives for mon-
ey were being continued. A new
twist will be added in the spring
with a telephone campaign in
areas with a large concentra-
tion of Davidson alumni, 1n-
cluding Charlotte, Raleigh, At-
lanta and New York.

“If Davidson shows strength
financially while other schools
are going downhill, Davidson
wil be eligible for more grants
from foundations and corpora-
tions,” Arbuckle said.

He expressed optimism in
this regard, pointing to the fact
that over the past three years,
the money collected from the
alumni has dramatically increa-
sed.

There are several factors
which could cause a deficit,
necessitating budget cuts and
an increased effort at funid
raising.

According to Cornell, some
of the prime factors are the
following:

(1) tuition: loss of $48,000

when only 301 freshmen en-
rolled instead of the planned
325.

(2) student auxiliary services:

a loss of $7,000 from room rent _

and other services.
(3)tuition: a loss of undeter-

mined amount from upper class-
men who have left school for
one or more terms for a var
iety of reasons.

(4) basketball: a loss of ap-
proximately $35,000 because of
leser game attendance than was
anticipated.

(5) annual fund: an overesti

mation of the amount that would
be collected.

* Cornell announced that the
Budget, Building and Grounds
Committee will meet next’ Mon-
day to consider the budget. In
addition to the regular faculty
members, Cornell has invited
Dean of Students Will H. Terry
and two students.

“Even though the faculty in
its infinite wisdom did not see

fit to include students on the
committee, I felt) that we
should have some student in

put,” he said.

There seems to be a consensus

of opinion that the possible

deficit is everyone's problem,
and not just the administra-
tion’s worry

As Peeples said. “Because

we are in fact) a community,
the crisis with which we are
faced is a legitimate concern
for everyone, including © stu-
dents.”

lems.’ Miller felt that the pub-
lic should be nade tnore aware
of this area, instead of the em-
phasis of public attention co
the dilemma of freedom and
control.

After the lecture John D. Kel-
ton. professor of psychology,
presented a Davidson T-shirt
with an experimental rat on its
front to Miller.

Miller’s Wednesday
speech} was the “Evolution of
Language."’ In summing up his
speech, Miller said, ‘There is
an argument over whether man
started to speak when the brain
got big or whether the brain got
big when man started to speak.
I believe the latter.”

While on campus Miller held
several informal discussions over
lunch and over coffee. At the
Honors College Miller gave a
third lecture, which, according
to Kelton, was “‘by invitation
only.”

EPC Alters
Pass-Fail

By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

The Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC) passed at its Feb.
21 meeting a motion which clar-
ifies the responsibilities of a
student desiring to take a course
on a pass-fail basis.

The motion states, ‘‘A student
does not have to obtain the pro-
fessor’s permission to take a
course on a pass-fail basis, but
he must have his advisor’s ap
proval, and all class rolls issued
by the Registrar will indicate
students taking courses on 4a
pass-fail basis.”

The confusion seems to have
arisen from the phrase, ‘All
class rolls issued by the Regis-
trar will indicate students tak-
ing courses on a pass-fail basis.”

Registrar Richard C. Burts,
Jr. defined this point saying
“All roles, not just those issued
immediately before the end of
the term, will contain this in-
formation."
