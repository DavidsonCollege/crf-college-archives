Rousing Chapel Reception ||Coming In November

By BOB STRAUSER
Davidsonlen Feature Editor

Chambers Auditorium has
served in times past as a

odium for such notables as

0zo Burleson, Mendell Riv-
ers and Walter Judd. Mon-
day morning Charles Mitch-
ell, candidate for the office
of Treasurer in North Caro-
lina, joined the ranks of
these notables Monday.

Mitchell's presence was divid-
ed between the “Great Issues"
program and the Young Re-
publicans and the speaker
launched. into his. defense of
matters conservative.

‘IT come. to you from the
depths of my heart because: I
believe in a cause,” announced
Mitchell. He went on to re-
mark that he had not chosen
“the. easy route” and that he
realized his subject matter
might be controversial.

Diving into the thick of the
controversy, he began. “I love
my God, my family, my coun-
try and my Consitution. If this
makes me a right-wing ex-
tremist, I am proud to bear
the title.”

Mitchell spoke glowingly of
candidate Goldwater and of his

tions, Mitchell continued. ‘The
salvation of the republic, not
an election, is at stake.” Sena-
tor Goldwater, he opined,
speaks with “honesty that has
never been seen on the na-
tional level in many a year.
Of course,” granted the can-
did candidate, “this will hurt
him in places.”

Such places that honesty
might hurt, according to Mitch-
ell, could be Texas (where
Goldwater spoke against the
placement of a local federal in-
stallation), Florida (where he
criticized proposed old-age
benefit programs), or Tennes-
see (where the Senator attack-
ed certain aspects of TVA.)

“NOT ON MY TEAM”

Mitchel} expressed his pride
in being a part of the conserva-
tive “team.” “Walter Reuther,
the socialists, the Communist
Party and the liberals are not
on my team and I’m proud,”
Mitchell declared. :

From these four national
threats, the campus visitor mov-
ed closer to home — more
specifically to Women’s College

*%. and a member of the history
.; department at that institution.

Directory Of Alumn:

The Alumni Office will
publish an alumni directory
listing the 10,000 Davidson
graduates in alphabetical, class,
and geographical order. Bill
Bondurant, director of alumni
activities, said the directory,
Davidson’s first in 40 years,
will be available by the last
week of October.

Bondurant explained that
several groups have. recently
requested such a publication.
The directory will also be of
use in soliciting contributions
for the Living Endowment Cam-
paign.

In regard to the problems in-
volved in compiling the pub-
lication, Bondurant commented,
“The big thing that you're up
against is time. We sometimes
get 20 changes of address
day. At this rate the directory
can rapidly become out of date.
The longer you walt from the
time it goes to press until the
time that it is released, the
more obsolete it becomes.”

However, Bondurant prom-
ises that with the aid of the
college’s new IBM processing
equipment, the directory can
be published within five weeks
of the time that the last address
change is made.

The directory will be distri-
buted without charge to the
persons who participated in the
1963-64 Living Endowment
Campaign. Additional copies
will be available at the Alumni
Office.

Concerning future issues,
Bondurant speculated that be-
cause of the ease of compiling
the directory one can probably
be published every two or three
years. He added that the pres-
ent directory is a pilot project
in the use of the IBM equip-
ment and “has enabled us to
see a number of opportunities
for the classification and pub-
lication of lists of atumni for
many different purposes. The
possibilities are unlimited.”

publican organization on the
WC campus.

By way of reply to the liber-
al academician, candidate
Mitchell reached perhaps the
high point of his address: “But
I say that he has no right to
say this on that campus be-
cause he is advocating the thing
to which I am opposed.”

After this defense of free-
dom of thought, the speaker
closed out the address with an
attack on swastikas appearing
on Southern California mail
(he had seen them first hand)
and finally devoted a few words
to a pernicious comic book
attacking the GOP nominec.

As Breat Issues" speaker,
Mitchell retired {o the Union
for a. brief coffee hour, every-
one left for the Hub to see if
a copy of the comic book was
available for local consump
tion.

Artist Series Brings
‘Twelfth Night’ Today

The Helen Hayes Repertory
Company will present William
Shakespeare’s ‘Twelfth Night”

tonight at 8:15 in Chambers’

Auditorium. With this program,
the Davidson College Artist
Series begins a new year of
bringing cultural entertain.
ment to the campus.

This particular offering is
a part of Davidson’s observance
of the 400th anniversary cele-
bration of Shakespeare's birth-
day.

Organized in 1852 by Helen
Hayes and its producer-direc-
tor Jack Manning, this group
of 12 performers represents a
collection of exceptional talent
from the fields of stage and

Veinfeld Defends
De Gaulle’s Actions

Charles de Gaulle was justi-
fied in blocking the entrance of
Great Britain into the Common
Market, said Richardson Scholar
Daniel Veinfeld in a discussion
Tuesday night in the Union
sponsored by the YMCA Inter-
national Students Committee.

From Marseilles, France,
Veinfeld defended de Gaulle’s
action in his talk entitled ‘De
Gaulle’s France’ as a move to
prevent England's entering the
Market still allied with its
Commonwealth nations.

Veinfeld said de Gaulle leads
France under the -constitution
which he has amended to suit
“Gaullism.” the brand and
theory of government which
the French president practices.

After de Gaulle, if he is not
killed, said Veinfeld, the suc-
cessor will be able to rule onl;
if the present constitution is
changed or amended.

The discussion revolved most:
ly around the Common Market
controversy with Richardson
Scholars George Rosso from
Italy and Simon Blackford and
Michael Light, both from Eng-
land, to present their ideas.

Talks by the Richardson stud
ents, sponsored by the, IRC,
will continue tnroughout the
year on topics of present-day
interest from a_ perspective
other than American.

television. The company has
attained considerable acclaim
for its previous performances,
and is now touring the south-
ern states, presenting plays at
many college and universities.

In order to rehearse ‘‘Hamlet"
and ‘‘Villians, Lovers, and
Fools,"’ two other plays they
will present on their tour, the
group will remain on campus
through tomorrow. This will give
interested students an excellent
opportunity to meet and talk
with these performers about
their’ work. Miss Hayes, how-
ever, will not be present, since
she does not- travel with the
group but acts. as its artistic
advisor.

Productor Director Manning
has done much fine work in
the field of entertainment, hav-
ing appeared with such persons
as Jose Ferrer, Uta Hagen
and Robert Preston. His tele-
vision production of “Hamlet”
ranks among the best of all
Shakespearean performances in
that medium. He has appeared
in several of his own group’s
productions also.

Graduate To Speak
At Monday Chapel

The Rev. William H. Crane.
a Davidson graduate active in
international student affairs.
will speak in Monday's chapel.

With a BD from Union Semi
nary in New York, the Rev.
Crane has recently participated
in the World Student Christian
Federation.

Born jin the Congo, he has
traveled extensively in Afric:
and has made visits to India
Europe and Latin America.

On Thursday the Rev. Char
les Johnson, Presbyterian Min
ister at Duke University, will
speak in chapel.

A North Carolinian, the Rev.
Johnson is a former Roman
Catholic. A musician, he is also
an entertainer and athlete.

No chapel program is schedul-
ed for Tuesday next week. On
Wednesday Senator Jennings
Randolph of West Virginia, will
speak on federal aid programs
in the Great Issues series.

Allocation Of Large Amount
To Aid Campus Organizations

The Student Body Financial Committee approved a plan this week for the alloca-
tion of the $24,675 Student Activity Fee to various campus activities and publications.
The total requests for money made to the committee exceeded the amount which
was available from the Activity Fee, and thus several publications received less than

they had asked for.

A comparison of the amounts requested and approved by the committee, as well
as the amounts approved last year, is as follows:

Quips and Cranks
Davidsonian

Scripts ’n Pranks
Wildcats Handbook
Student Body
Artist Series

5,250

1964-65 1963-64
Requested Approved Approved
$8,900 $8,700 $8,700
6,000 5,750 5,750

1,375 1,375 1,375
1,000 1,000 910

5,250 4,650

The Student Activity Fee is set at $25 per student and is taken yearly from the
$100 General Fee. As approved for this year by the Finance Committee, and as tak-
en on a “per student” basis, each $25 Activity Fee is divided as follows: Quips and
Cranks, $8.81, The Davidsonian, $5.83; Scripts ‘n Pranks, $2.45; Wildcat Handbook,
$1.89; Student Body, $1.01; Artist Series, $5.32.

The $180 difference between the total of the Activity Fees collected and the
total amount approved is being held in reserve for next year.

who approach modern society
with incisive, down-to-earth ob-
servation.

Room at the Top is a story of
opportunism, of status-sceking
and
promises some trenchant ob
servations on this “eult of stic-
cess"’ jin the series of discus-
sions he will lead.

Says the author, Nothing can
be more fascinating than the
study of status. The novelist
cannot afford not to be fasei-
nated by it. He is the onily
one able to view :it with prop.
er detachment since he posses.
ses no status himself.. I'm glad
I'm like the pathologist. whose
only concern with the disease
is to study it; I am neither like
the physician who has to cure
it nor like the patient who has
to suffer from it.”

Braine brings to the Davidson
campus a wealth of experience
and a faculty of acute percep-
tion which often is lacking in
the social critic,

So that interested persons
might have the chance to ex-
amine John Braine’s style and
his ideas, 300 copies of Reom at
the Top have been ordered by
the college book store and will
soon be on sale for 60 cents.

Though his exact schedule is
yet to be determined, Braine
will probably follow the usual
procedure of speaking in chapel
and conducting informal discus-
sions later in the day.

Davidsonian Feature Writer

While the recent “discov-
ery” of a wallet and papers
belonging to Brigadier-Gen-
eral William .Lee Davidson
has caused mild excitement
in some quarters here at
Davidson, it has been of lit-
tle aid in giving any clues
to his personal life.

This wallet, found lately in
the Public Records Office in
London, England, was apparent-
ly taken from the corpse of
General Davidson after he had
been shot trying to cross Cow-
an's Dam, on the Catawba
River. It was probably then
sent to the Public Records of-
fice where it has lain for the
past 182 years.

Contents are of little value
to modern historians as all
papers refer either to known
facts and situations, or are im-
personal correspondences with
his comtemporaries. From the
entire group of 16 documents
no new or relatively interesting
information can be drawn, ex-
cept, perhaps, that General
Davidson must have had an
unusually large wallet in which
to keep all of this ‘historical
trash.”

Among the most interesting
articles found were a bill for
% of a dollar, a letter from a
Tory’s widow requesting the

power grabbing. Braine

CONSTRUCTION ON CAMPUS—
Work on renovating the steam plant
(above) is proceeding close to schedule,
according to Grover C. Meetze, director
of the Physical Plant. Besides the new
roof, the complete face-lifting will in-

clude covering the coal pits in front of

the building, thus creating more work
area, and installing modern safety
equipment for the boilers. Meetze said,
“The changes wilf give us one of the
most up-to-date steam plants of any in-
stitution our size.”

Auto Violations On Rise:
‘Nothing intentional’

By DAVID COFFEY
Davidsonian Staff Writer
Stricter enforcement of the
automobile parking regulations
since the beginning of the: fall
semester has resulted in a
marked increase in the number
of tickets issued for violations.
Since July 1, $236 in fines have
been collected, while during
the comparable period in 1963,
no more than $75 was received.
The new assistant dean of
students, Dr. Robert G. Jones,
who every Friday conducts traf-
fic court, insists there has been
no intentional crackdown.
“We are only trying to en-
force the parking regulations
which .the faculty has approv-
ed.’ Jones said. “The adminis-
tration has always. contended,’-

he continued, ‘‘that ‘it, does not
give out tickets to increase
the college’s revenue, but to
facilitate the control of cam-
pus traffic.”

Most of the tickets issued
during the first week of classes
were issued lo students without
parking permits, who parked
in areas around the dorms re-
stricted only to vehicles with
such permits. In more recent
weeks, however, more tickets
have been issued to student
cars illegally parked in areas
reserved for the faculty or
ROTC Department, or to cars
parked. in the road in front
of the fraternities, where all
parking is prohibited.

Parking tickets are given by
the campus. security foree. and

Jones referred to the effort to ©

identify the owners of the cars
given tickets as a ‘‘time-con-
suming process.”

He also sald, ‘‘When the
car-has no student permit, the
only clue we have is the license
number and the state from
which it came. In such cases,
we must write and find out in
whose name these licenses are
issued, Many cars given tickets
are never identified.”

UNION PARKING

Within the next few weeks
new signs will be. posted in
the faculty parking area near
the Union restricting the area
lo faculty cars only during the
hours of 8 am. to 5 p.m.
on weekdays, and from 8 a.m.
to 12:30 p.m. on Saturdays.
This rule change by the faculty
traffic committée is designed
to make the Union more acces-
sible to students during the
evening. This fall, the faculty
committee. also acted to ban
motorcycles and motor bikes
from the campus. ~/

E. N. (Cop) Linker, campus

security officer, advises all
Students to read carefully the
parking regulations in the

freshman handbook. ‘I’m inclin-
ed to believe,” he stated,
“that the number of tickets is:
sued has increased because
these fellows haven't read the
regulations,

“It seems to me that most
upperclassmen must think that
the handbooks are for .fresh-
men only. but that's not the
case. I don't like to give out

tickets, and students are always
giving me excuses to explain
Why they’re Jllegally parked
where they are. All in all, it’s
a helluva job.”

AFTER 182 YEARS

Gen. Davidson’s Wallet Found

return of her slave boy, a letter
from General Thomas Sumter;
and a lst of recruits in one of
the regiments ‘under his com-
mand. (This letter is interesting
only because it shows ‘that of
31 men in the regiment, 18
could not even sign their own
name.)

Dr. Chalmers Davidson, direc-
tor of the library, has said:
“General Davidson, although
there was no more completely
adored soldier in North Caro-
lina, has always been a rather
impersonal figure.’ Little is
known of his personal life,
which would probably be pain-
fully uninteresting.

He apparently had a happy
home life, (he had eight chil-
dren), but no papers from his
family or close friends have
ever been found. He was a
popular soldier and a good
leader; his major problem was
proving it.

He had never mage any note:
able blunders or érrors, .but he
was for some reason, ordered
to keep out of the battle of Cow-
pens and the battle of King’s
Mountain, contenting himself
with merely sending in portion
of his troops while he remain-
ed behind. True, he did bottle
up Cornwallis at Charlotte, but
this was a minor action, ub-
worthy of winning for him any

real laurels.

Kept out of aity major situa-
tion from the b:ginning of the
war, until his death. Davidson
never had a chance to prove
himself. Perhaps if he had been
piaced in a erucial situation

he wot!d have won, glory and
fame, but “every, time the bases
were loaded and he was up to
bat he was pulled out of the
line-up.” He was, in the words,
of Dr. Davidson, “a man with
no runs, no hits and no errors.”
