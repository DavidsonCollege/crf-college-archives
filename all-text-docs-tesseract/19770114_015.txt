Swimmers swap
victories in meet

As one Davidson swimmer
put it, “There was no way we
could beat Furman, and no
way we could lose to South
Carolina State,’’ and that’s
exactly what happened as the
Davidson’s swim team trav-
eled to Greenville last Satur-
day for a double duel meet.
Davidson split, losing to Fur-
man 62-41 and defeating
South Carolina State 75-37.

“‘Our times really weren’t
that good at all,”’ said Coach
Pat Miller, ‘‘but we were
working long yardage all
week, and didn’t cut down at
all before the meet.”’

The outstanding perform-
ance of the meet was by
Jonathan Washburn, who
smashed Davidson's 200-yard

backstroke record with a time
of 2:07.9, breaking his own
record of 2:11.7.

‘‘We are really working’

hard,’’ said Coach Miller.
“Our times will start to fall.
Some of our swimmers who
were sick are well now.”

Coach Miller looks optimist-
ically at future meets. ‘“‘We’ve
got some big meets coming
up— Madison this weekend,
William and Mary next week
—and it'll take a super effort.
We give up 16 points each
meet due to no entry in the
diving. That could make the
difference. We just don’t have
the facilities.’’

The Wildcat swim team
currently stands 3-1 with the
split last weekend. The next
meets are this weekend, Mad-
ison Friday and Augusta Sat-
urday.

:Wildcaties split games, —

The Davidson women’s bas-
ketball team got off to a good
start following Christmas
break by defeating Augusta
College 54-50. The Wildcats
had fulfilled their promise of
having a 2-2 record before
Christmas, so the record in-
creased 3-2, with the Augusta

, game.

At the half Davidson was

winning, 34-28, and hitting -

48.5 percent of their field
goals. Augusta, on the other
hand, was only hitting 32.3
percent. However, during the
second half Davidson’s shoot-

“ing percentage hit an all-time

low of 20 percent, which
accounts for the close final
score.

The Wildcats played a very
good defensive game, with
Cindy Morrison pulling down

21 of the 59 rebounds account- .

able to Davidson. Sarah Wom-
ack was top scorer with 18
points, and also pulled down
13 rebounds.

Cindy Morrison came out of
the game with 16 points, and
Beth Tanner with 13.

The second game following
Christmas break was a frust-
rating loss to Mars Hill, 80-67.
Although Davidson domina-
ted the rebounding score, the
Wildcats’ shots were contin-
ually rejected by the basket,
only hitting an average of 28
percent.

something foreign to the per-

“son with normal desires to

have fun without playing the
childish little girl games that
suddenly are the ‘‘do’s and
don’ts”’ of scoring at D.C.

I feel like a jaded lecher as I
walk around here now. The
Davidson I came to is not the
Davidson of today’s brave new
nerds. You people play your
little disco games in a frenzied

effort to loosen the pre-med ©

shackles, establishing a scene
where the library is the social
nerve center where people go
to see and be seen. You are
young and have the energy to
make of Davidson what you
will.

The rest of us, raised ina
different tradition (where peo-
ple were measured by more
than a GPA and who they
danced with on Friday night),

see little incentive to fight off §f

several years’ ennui and take
part in the present system
that is a travesty of normal
human involvements and ex-
pressions.

Sour grapes? You bet! Bit- —

ter? Damn straight! But when
you look around and what you
see resembles amateur’s night
at the Debutante Sock Hop,
when the sheer mathematics of
the situation and the arrow-

straight, utterly conformist
mind set of both sexes here are
considered, one as cool as
myself can’t help but feel a
little beaten from the start
(and the stereotypes, of all
concerned, go marching on).
Too bad this will all bounce
off of most of you, gentle

readers. The above is not a
lampoon and I am serious
when I say that you. are
hurting more than yourselves.
But then the Davidson stu-
dent has never been noted for
his or her regard for anything
other than Number One. So
boogey on, brothers and sis-
ters.

Womack dominated with ele-
ven rebounds apiece. Beth
Tanner, Sarah Womack, and
Cindy Morrison were tied for
top scorer with sixteen points
apiece.

Although three names have
generally dominated this rep-

overall record remains even

ort, honorable mention should
be given to the other suppor-
ting members: Bonnie Caul-
kins, Ann Clark, Donna Fer-
ren, Ann Lowder, Nancy Ma-
theny, Nora McNeill, Kat
Morton, Babs Patton, Becca
Stimson, and Beth Thacker.

CINDY MORRISON’S shot is to no avail as
Wildcattes go down to defeat against Mars Hill.
