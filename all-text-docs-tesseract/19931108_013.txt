Blues Monday hosts Lil' Ed

By Rachel Newcomb

On Monday, November 1, Lil’
Ed and the Blues Imperials trans-
formed the 900 room intoa packed
Chicago blues joint. With the help
of their charismatic front man, Lil’
Ed, the Blues Imperials treated the
Davidson community toan evening
of the blues. This event was the
_ third ina series of Intimate Perfor-
mance Committee offerings.

Natives of Chicago, Lil’ Ed
and the Blues Imperials have been
playing in some form or another
since 1975. At the age of fifteen,
Lil’ Ed Williams learned to play
slide guitar, and with the help of
his brother, bassist James “Pookie”
Young, created the Blues Imperi-
als.

They began playing gigs
around Chicago and developed a
reputation as an especially hot act
during the early 80s. In 1985, the
Blues Imperials drew the attention
of Alligator Records, who quickly
signed them after hearing them
live. In 1986, they released their
first album, “Roughhousin’”,
which received critical acclaim
from sources as varied as New
York’s Village Voice, The New
York Times, and Spin Magazine.
They followed this album with
Chicken, Gravy & Biscuits in 1989
and have recently released What

You See Is What You Get. Cur-
rently, the lineup includes second
guitarist Mike Garrett, drummer
Kelly Littleton, tenor saxist Eddie
McKinley, bassist James “Pookie”
Young and Lil’ Ed.

Monday’s well-attended show
in the 900 room featured Lil’ Ed
and the Blues Imperials perform-
ing some of their own songs for the
Davidson audience.

The band’s decidedly casual
appearance and laid back attitude
contributed to the relaxed feel of
the material. Unlike some more
traditional blues artists who sing
mournful ballads that could have
been written in the 1940s rather
than the 1990s, this band’s songs
have a modern, more current edge
tothem. Most of the songs were
upbeat, foot stompin’ blues that
were more conducive to dancing
in the aisles than to crying into
one’s beer.

Against the backbone of lyr-
ics that dealt with the traditional
themes of loneliness, love and be-
trayal, Lil’ Edand the Blues Impe-
rials fleshed out the words with
their skillful musicianship. “My
baby left me all alone/ She left me
and my guitar/ I’m a poor boy all
alone,” Lil’ Ed wailed plaintively,
but he delivered his lines with a
huge grin. Most of the music was

happy and full of energy, perfectly
punctuated by the fire that dripped
from Lil’ Ed’s excellent slide gui-
tar. It wasn’t until the seventh or
eighth song that the band played a
slow number. Many numbers gave
each of the band members achance
to shine, with solos by the bassist,
drummer, and second guitarist.
Lil’ Ed and the Blues Imperi-
als quickly succeeded in capturing
the delight of the audience with
their skillful, spirited blues. One
especially good song was
“Chicken, Gravy, and Biscuits,”
which included vocal help from
the other band members. “I’ll eat
it all night long!” Lil’ Ed sang

‘enthusiastically, ending the song

with a little jump.

During the last song of the
first set, Lil’ Ed performed a
backbend while still playing his
guitar. Falling to his knees, he
leaned back until he was no more
than an inch from the ground. To
the delight of the audience, he then
jumped up and smiled his toothy
grin.

The entire set had included
only one slow number. Lil’ Edand
the Blues Imperials served the
Davidson crowd an entertaining
slice of Chicago blues, demonstrat-
ing an evolved technique and a
progressive style.

itself (the town’s besiegement and
the people’s suffering).

Moreover, the fact that the
artist placed the subjects in a cube
was, “essential to how he drama-
tized it.”

Elsen proved this theory by
showing how the placement of the
subjects communicates a progres-
sion of thought and action.

Elsen, in praising the genius
of the Burghers of Calais, drew a
unique comparison between the
initial reception of this work in
1889 and the response that oc-
curred at the unveiling of the Viet-

According to the speaker, both
treat their heroic subjects as a part
of daily life. As a result, the two
works have “redefined courage in
a modern way.”

' Davidson’s own Rodinsculp-
ture of Jean D’Aire (one of the
burghers) is, according to Elsen
the penultimate study of what was
to become the finished product.

Commenting on this particu-
lar work, Elsen stated that, “Rodin
had never done a finer sculpture
than that of the Jean D’Aire.”
