Davis To Be Judge
Of Court of Control;
Announces Revisions

“Hoopy” Davis has been
chosen as judge of the Court of
Control for 1950, Randy Taylor
student body president, disclosed
this week. Davis was elected by
a committee composed of the
president of the student body to-
gcther with the Student Council
members of the rising senior class,
which also elected his co-workers
for next year? Johnny Kelton will
be recorder, while Tom Allen and
J. B. Stroud will be the senior
‘members; John Guiton and Bill
Brooks, the junior members, and
Arnold Whisnant and . Gordon
Stuart, the sophomore members on
Davis’s staff,

For Davis, a rising senior from
Decatur, Ga., this will be his second
straight year on the freshman gov-
erning body, serving as a junior
member during the past year. He
announced tentative plans for re
modeling the court in an attempt
to re-achieve ils initial purpose—
that of instilling freshmen with the
high ideals and concepts of David-
son, instead of allowing it to be
used more as an humorous outlet
for the upperclassmen. Davis ex-
pressed the desire that next year,
the entire student body will fall
in line with his hopes of making
the court beneficial and helpful to
freshmen, instead of merely tor-
menting them. He feels that the
court can be of great value to
freshmen if it is governed proper-
ly and hopes to attain success in
making the court a little more
serious and profitable to all.

change of the local organization
into an A.T.O, club, Mr. Vann, who

rived on the campus following an

local group has had to meet with
the approval of ‘1e A.T.O. chap-
ters of this district, the high coun-
cil of the fraternity and the na-
tional president. The next and final
step toward initiation as ‘an active
chapter of A.T.O,, will be the ap-
proval of two-third of the chapters

next year took place. Speeches
were made by incoming President
Bill Boand, and by outgoing Presi-
dent Malloy Owen. Professors

Development Drive
Approaching Quota

The Davidson Development pro-
gram will come to a close on Junc

'$, when a final report will be giv-

en at Commencement. With six
areas yet to report, the drive now
stands approximately $250,000
short of the $2,500,000 goal.
According to Mr. Arnold, assis-
tant to the president, the campaign
will be officially closed on thi:
date, but some scattered contribu-
tions can be expected to follow
throughout the summer and _ fall.
At the present time, a last minute
appeal is being made to the alum-
ni who have not yet contributed, as
well as a second appeal in some
cases. Those areas that now have
incomplete reports are Reidsville,
Statesville, Wilmington, Florence.
S. -C., Charleston, S. C., and Bris-
tol, Tenn. It is hoped that their re-
ports will. aid in lowering the pres-

_ent.deficit in the goal.

The development program had
its beginning in the autumn of
1948 when the National Develop-
ment committee, headed by Chair-
man J. Spencer Love, met to pre-
sent. plans for the campaign. The
actual drivé began on February 11,
1949 and met with miraculous suc-
cess. Within a few weeks, the Char-
lotte-Mecklenburg County goal of
$750,000 was over-subscribed by
$100,000. Over $100,000 was raised
by students of the college and towns
people, At the end of five months,

BRAWN REPLACES BRAINS IN
BATTLE OF THE MID-CENTURY

On Thursday afternoon, the
Senior class of Davidson College,
in six closely contested trials of
athletic skill, outlasted a die-hard
faculty, and despite the efforts of
such greats as Dr. Frontis John-
ston, Professors Jim Pinckney,
Chalmers Davidson, Henry Bau-
mann, and Coaches Boyd Baird,
Crowell Little, Charlie Parker and
Dick Redding, the faculty members
found themselves two events short
of a victory as the 1950 edition of
Senior faculty day faded with the
setting sun.

The first events of the day took
place simultaneously on the hand-
ball and badminton courts, and the

faculty made a brilliant beginning
by taking both events, winning all
the handball games, and losing on-
ly one badminton contest, Jo-Jo
Thigpen, after his handball victory
over big Mac Erwin, said with a
modest smile, “Mac had an off
day. I was lucky,” and in badmin-
ton Harrison Taylor's status was
changed to that of the baldheaded
man on the losing team.

At two o'clock the teanis matches
got underway, and although the
Seniors took tue event by winning
both doubles matches, in the singles,
Professor Frontis Johnston and his
pipe defeated Slick Evans and his

Ralph Vaughn-Williams “March:
Sea Songs.” Completely different
from the usual march heard at pa-
rades and concerts, this number
is a compilation of sea tunes which
the composer heard in his native
England. This is the second work
by Vaughn-Williams to be played
on the campus, the first being the
symphonic work “Job” which was
played by the Cincinnati Symphony
im its concert earlier this year.

The second selectica yas a num-
ber by the Russian composer,
Kabalevsky, “Comedians Gallop."
Even though the .tempo of this
piece is extraordinarily rapid and
thus very difficult, it is one of the
bands’ favorite selections.

The final number of the concert
was the “Gaiete Parisienne” by
Jacque Offenbach. This number is
a posthumus work, a ballet, and
consists of pieces by Offenbach
which have been transcribed for
band by the director of the Navy
Band, Five of the numbers from
the ballet were played by the band,
the first the Overture which is
taken from one of Offenbach’r
operas. The second part is entitled
Gallop, the third Valse, which is
the love music from the opera
“Orpheus in Hades.” The fourth
part is the Quadrille or Dance and
and the final part the Can Can
from the opera “Orpheus in Hades,”

SOCIAL FRATERNITIES HOLD
ANNUAL SPRING FUNCTIONS

Several of the social fraternities
held functions last week end both
on and off the campus,

Perhaps the most colorful and
interest-drawing of the was Kappa
Alpha's Old South Ball. For one
week end each year this group re-
lives the customs and events of
those days immediately prior to
the Civil War. Dressed in string
bow ties and other such items of
the period, they presented quite a
unique sight to freshmen and trans-
fers. After an official seccession
ceremony, festivities were remov-
ed to the Morris Field Officer's
Club. There the brothers enjoyed
a banquet followed by an after.
dinner talk by Mr. Gus Travis.
Charlotte Observer columnist. High
light of the evening was the ball it-
self for which Chick Burroughs sup-
plied the rythm and razz. One
irony marked the entire week end:
Confederate uniforms ordered for
the occasion failed to arrive due
to a Southern Railroad strike.

Sigma Phi Epsilon celebrated its
annual Sweetheart Ball at the Red
Fez Club. An installation of officers
for the coming term was held, fol-

117.00| lowed by an entertaining program
60.86| given by this year’s former pledge
400.00} class. Walter Hagen and his orches-

tra played for the dance at which
the Sig Ep Sweetheart was given
a loving cup.

The yearly Rose Ball of Pi Kap-

pa Phi took place at Morris Field
Policemen’s Club. F, L. Jackson,
treasurer of the college, spoke at
the. conclusion of a banquet there.
Senior members of the fraternity
received cuff links commemorating
their last year of active brother-
hood. Musicmaker Ziggy Herwitz
set. the dance in mation during
which Miss Charlotte Rustin of Co-
lumbia, S. C., was crowned Rose
of Pi Kappa Phi for 1950.

The college dining room was the
scene of a banquet held by Pi
Kappa Alpha. Alec Hodgin served
as emcee for this portion of the
Pika Dream Girl Ball, while Lee
Talbert created peals of laughter
among those present with his clev-
er skit. Brothers and their dates
then adjourned to the dance at Er-
win Lodge for which Fleet Green
and his Flitty Fifty made with the
notes. Miss Rosemary Swaney of
Wilmington, N. C., was voted Pika
Dream Girl of 1950 after which she
was given a Dream Girl pin and a
bouquet of red roses.

Differing only in dress and mu
sic, Kappa Sigma whooped it up
at a square dance given at the
Charlotte Observer Fresh Air
Camp. Mr. Pat Williams, from
North Wilkesboro, called the danc-
es. Hal Haynes and his cohorts
manufactured their version of hill-

billy music, A
