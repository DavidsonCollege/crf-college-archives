DR. W. T. LAPRODE MAKES
OPENING U. W. W. ADDRESS

The United War Campaign was
opened in the college by a talk given here
Sunday night by Dr. W. T. Laprode.
Dr. Laprode is a former professor of
Trinity College, but is now engaged in
the training of “Y” secretaries at Blue
Ridge. Dr. Laprode opened his talk by
showing the opportunity and responsibil-
ity of the young man of today. ‘The
greatest’ need for Christian service ia
the history of the world, Dr. Laprode
said, is today. But in order to-get some-
thing good out of the sacrifices that are
being made on the battlefields of Europe
and that haye been made, things must be
organized. For the next few years more
money will be needed than when the fel-
lows were fighting.

Now that the real goal has been
reached the real danger arises for the
boys “over there.” More money and
effort will be needed to keep up their
morale. More will be required. “The
victory that the boys have won must be
made good. ‘The Y. M. C. A. plans te
establish schools “over there” to prepare

- the boys for work when they come back.
The money required for this work will
be valy a small sum compared with the
sums we have spent for guns. ‘This
money will go directly and wholly to our
boys. Our boys are due it. The victory
has been won at a very great cost. ‘The
only justification in God's sight will be
to make the victory good.

Each individual is in the army, has
friends in the army, or is a citizen of the
United States. ‘The boys “over there”
must be made and kept the best of men,
for they will form the next generation.
So in giving to the United War Work
Campaign one Kives to a most funda-
‘mental cause.

The share, for Davidson College is
four thousand, After such an inspiring
talk by Dr, Laprade in which he showed
the sacrifices of the boys “over there”
and the “Y” secretaries, Davidson Col-
Jege will go “over the top” without a
doube and uphold her reputation,

FRATERNITY HOUSES ARE,
ALLOWED TO RE-OPEN

Monday was one big day! - One of
the interesting happenings of that day
was the opening of the Fraternities. The
fraternities in all S. A. C. colleges
were ordered closed by the fovernment
October 20. ‘The order has now been
rescinded and the houses are open again,
much to the pleasure of the members.
‘The commanding officer has the right to
put any restrictions on them he sees fit,
but he states that so long as they do not
interfere with military work he will
place no restrictions on them.

SOLDIERS HAD PAY DAY—
CAUSES GREAT REJOICING

Among the many announcements of
glad tidings on Monday was one con-
cerning pay day. There have been many
rumors concerning this subject, but that
it would actually come on ‘Tuesday was
the first specific official anouncement
concerning the issuing of the pay for Oc-
tober,

We all received our pay yesterday
and now we are burdened with the re-
sponsibility of dispensing with it.

RED CROSS CHAPTER IS
NOW KNITTING SWEATERS

The regular work of the Davidson
Red Cross Society has been somewhat
neglected this fall on account of unavoid-
able interrutpions. Who shall say, ‘tho,
that the knitting of sweaters and the
making of bandages is more important
than the work which has been done?

The first interruption came in the
form of the influenza epidemic in the
college. No one on the campus needs to
be told of the importance of the work
done by the members of the society in
checking the disease liere.

Close on the heels of the college epi-
demic came a similar yvutbreak in’ the
town. ‘There, tuo, the Red Cross did
invaluable work, In addition to the
work done by its members, the society
secured the services of Miss Hill, trained
nurse and daughter of Mr. John Hill,
for the sick town people. “The backbone
of the epidemic seems to have — been
broken now, but there is. still danger
from isolated cases. ‘Che society is try-
ing to find another trained nurse to take
the place of Miss Hill, who has been
called to other important work,

Now that the influenza situation does
not require the active work of many. of
the members, the society is getting down
to usual work again. Wool for the knit-
ting of sweaters has already been issued
to the ladies. A number of Christma:
boxes are to be filled soon. ‘These wil!
he mailed in the regular Red Cross car-
tons which have been ordered. A Home
Service department is now being organ-
ized and this work is to be vigorousn
prosecuted in the future.

The Junior Red Cross is also doing
good work. Little girls from six to ten
have learne ! to knit squares and are now
meeting once a week to make these into
quilts for our wounded soldiers.

LIBRARY NOTES.

We have little time to spend. these
days, reading novels, And what time
we may have for reading fiction is gen-
erally spent with current | magazines,
either at the “Y" reading room, or at the
library, When we do sit down with a
book, it is to learn something serious.
So, naturally, the number of books deal-
ing with science is increasing faster than
those of all other books in the library,
exept military.

The following group of books, dealing
with science, is typical of what the
library can afford on kindred subjects:
“The Earth, Its Life and Death,” Ber-
get; “Marthquakes.”, Milne; “Earth.
quakes,” _ Hobbs: “The Earthquake.”
Train: “Naturalist’s Voyage Around the
World,” Darwin: “Structure and Dis-
tribution. of Coral Reefs.” Darwin:
“Physico-Chemical. Methods.” Troube,
translated by W. L. Hardin; “Text-
book of Botany.’ Coulter, Barnes,
Cowles. All but one or two of these
books are new.

The following are books on literary

subjects: “The Cycle of Spring.”
Tagore: “The Greatest of Literary
Problems.” Baxter; “On the Art of

Writing.” Quiller-Couch; “Shakespeare
and the Founders of Liberty in Amer-
ica,” Gayley: “Representative Plays by
American Dramatists,” Moses: “Letters
of Richard Watson Gilder,” Gilder,
Ignorance of the library hour has
caused quite a little confusion and
trouble on the campus. At present, the
library is open from 2 to 4 p.m. and
from § to 7:15 p.m. The reading room
is open all day—from 9 a. m. to 9:30
p.m. Those students not in the S. A.
T. C. are asked to get their books from
the library during the earlier hours, if
convenient, so that there will not be a
congestion from 5 p. m. to 7:15 p.m.

day afternoon on the Hill.
