A MUSEUM OF DIRT.

There is on the second floor of Cham-
bers, facing the campus, a great, spacious
room which runs the whole width of
the main building. [nm days yone by it
was the library hall, and remnants of
this old library are still strewn over the
floor and through the three galleries. It
is a favorite occupation of Davidson men
now to delve into the piles of old maya
zines and records that are left on the
shelves.

Vhe hall is dignified today, however,
with the name of museum. On the
main floor are large cabinets of rocks,
fossils, shells ‘and minerals. Several
shelves are filled with specimens, which
are said to total ten thousand in number.

Strange to say, though, this usc
is not intended for inspection. Surely
no one would say that it is never to be
seen by outside friends when the dust of
a century seems to lie all over it. Wheth-
er this is to illustrate the geologic prin-
ciple of erosion or the manner of land
formation, we do not know. But we
do know that the specimens in the cabi-
nets are being scattered and = moved
about, that the books left on the shelve:
in the hall are being thrown around,
and that the whole place with its dust
and dirt presents an appearance of rack
and ruin.

The 1914 Davidson catalogue says of
the museum: “The Geology —depart-
ment has at its disposal splendid (?)
cabinets of rocks, fossils, etc., found in
the college museum. “These — cabinets
have been accumulating (dust?) for
fifty years. Besides numerous smaller
additions bv gifts, exchange, and pur-
chase, the ‘Brunby Cabinet’ was added
by purchase, containing one thousand
two hundred minerals, three thousand
fossils, and one thousand one hundred
recent shells; there was added. by do-
nation, about one thousand five hundred
minerals; and also a collection of shells
given by State Geologist Kerr.”

If we are in possession of such a valu-
able museum, consisting of cabinets
given and purchased, it seems that a lit-
tle money ought to be spent in keeping
it clean and free from careless intruders.
Muclt has been said from time to time on
this ouestion. Let us hope that something

may be done immediately to change the
room from an eyesore to a place of in-
terest when our friends visit Davidson
at Commencement.

The great high ceiling and high win-
dows looking out toward the pillars have
always given the hall a distinctive ap-
pearance, and very little expense in
cleaning and improvement would make
the museum an interesting and attract-
ive feat-ire of the college.

But of what value is a museum of
dirt?

PRESENT AND FUTURE.

It was a fine thing and inspiring to
Davidson undergraduate to see
five or six o'd classes represented at the
Alumni Banquet in. Charlotte last week
rise and pledge their members to a $500

share in the new Gymnasium which is) @ne time. 5c. a line.

to be built within a year or two. We
need the Gymnasium badly and we will
look forw ard eagerly to its completion.

But in our enthusiasm over future
plans and needs, Jet us not forget our
present needs in the way of athletics.
“They are urgent needs and cannot be
neglected. The Alumni Athletic Asso-
clation is facing a crisis in its new his-
tory, a crisis of financial — stringency.
New coaches and splendid coaches have
been secured and will be secured. “The
Alumni Association does this through
its faith in the loyalty of — Davidson
Alumni. Surely they will not fail.
They have never failed before, and the
Association is looking to them now for
their adamant support in giving David-
son victorious teams this year,

After all, college athletics is madé up
of men, and in our eagerness for new
buildings and equipment, let us not for-
wet the present need for means to deve-
lop the material we already have at
hand.

We have been glad to receive several
copies cof ‘’ The Clarion,” a monthly
paper published by the students of the
Belmont High School, Belmont, N. Cc.
If seems to us that this is one of the
best of the high school papers that we
have seen and itis a credit to the Bel-
mont Schools and to the “Clarion” staff.

UNION SEMINARY PLAYS
CHARLOTTE Y. M. C. A,

‘Vhere was a splendid game of basket
ball played in Ciarlotte at the Y. ML.
C. A. last: Monday, when the team ot
Union, ‘Theological Seminary measured
its strength against that of the “Green
Machine.” lt was a hard fought game
from start to finish, At the start, it
looked -as if it would be a “run-away'
for the Union team. but in the latter
part ot the last half the Charlotte team
came back strong and won the game by
twe points. “The Green Machine was
really outplayed, but the Union men
were handicapped in that they were ac-

customed to playing under — collegiate
rules rather than Y. M. C. A. rules, the
“two hand rule ‘especially troubling

them. Consequently there were a great
many fouls made. Those starring on
the Union team were Locke White and
‘There were several Davidson
men on the Union team, among whom
were Locks White, “Molly” Boyd, and
Bedinger (sub).

REV. R. T. COT WILL

ADDRESS Y. M. Cc. A

The regular Y. M. C. A. meeting
next Vhursday night will be led by Rev.
R. ‘T. Coit, missionary to Korea.
“Bob” Coit, as he is familiarly known
at Davidson, graduated in ‘og and for
several years has been in’ the foreign
field. He was supported for several
years by the Davidson Student Body.
Those who attended the Laymen’'s
Convention in Charlotte will remember
the forceful address made by Mr. Coit
on Wednesday morning.
Mr. Coit will conduct special prayer
services for the Y. M. C. A. Vhurs-
day, Friday, and Saturday nights, and
will preach at the church on Sunday.

SOPH MAGAZINE.

The Sophomore number of the Maga-
zine went to press on the 20th of this
month, and is expected to come out about
the 5th of March. Every article in it
was written by a Sophomore, and as
there seems to be a good deal of talent in
that class, it should be a good number
of the Magazine. There will be no
editorials in this number, since the whole
thing was given to the Sophomores.
Even the Exchanges were written by
one of that class.
