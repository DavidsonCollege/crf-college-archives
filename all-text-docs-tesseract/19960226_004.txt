Liposuction,
lifts and lasers

Dascombe gives us a
glimpse of plastic surgery
“now and in the future”

By Laura ALLEN

“Young people seek better
mates and better jobs by looking
better, and evidence shows that
appearance helps,” said Plastic
Surgeon Dr. William Dascombe
of The Plastic Surgery Center in
Savannah, GA, as he spoke to
students and faculty Tuesday night
concerning the present and future
role of plastic surgery.

Sponsored by the Medical
Humanities Program, Dascombe
addressed the popularity of re-
constructive surgery “to restore
human form and dignity” as a
cosmetic one, stressing that “the
keys to beauty are balance and
proportionality” and used slides
of face lifts, and other adjustments
made to the eyes, lips and nose as
illustrations.

Dascombe addressed the di-

rection of plastic surgery techno-
logically, from laser beams to tis-
sue engineering, which he re-
ferred to as the “way of the fu-
ture.”

He stressed that although
great advances had been made,
these solutions are still not “‘per-
fect.”

Dascombe also admitted his
concern for the implications of
plastic surgery and where limits
should be placed.

Finally, in a question and
answer period, Dascombe talked
about the rapid growth in the field
of plastic and reconstructive sur-
gery, which he attributed to the
fact that “most people would
rather invest money in themselves
than in material things.”

“Older people must compete
with younger people for jobs, and
so want to look their best also,”
he said.

Sherman says that “the students
will be directly involved in the
process [of selecting a president)”
to replace President John
Kuykendall, who recently an-
nounced his resignation, effective
next spring.

Wick says that he would like
to see the new president be “a
leader with a vision. Inthe upcom-
ing years the school is on the verge
of change, and I hope that our new
president will try to improve the
school while also taking into con-
cern the cares and concerns of the
students.”

The group’s exact function in
the search has yet to be determined.
Sherman says that the decision as
to whether students will be given
the responsibility to vote on or
simply recommend candidates lies
with the trustees.

“This is going to require a lot
of flexibility,” she says of the presi-
dential selection task. “The stu-
dents who were picked definitely

far away as New York, Missouri,
Wisconsin and Georgia, will likely
be asked to be present in the area
periodically throughout the sum-
mer. The group will continue their
work next fall as well.

A five student committee,
which included Sherman, Bill
Gullan, Wesley Hart, Stephanie
Morgan, and Ashley Tabb, con-
ducted 15 to 20 minute interviews
with all 23 candidates, during
which they “tried to get a general
feel for the way [applicants] pre-
sented themselves” and what they
“valued about Davidson,” says
Sherman.

Junior Caroline Bynum and future resident Danny Jetton Jr. load a wheelbarrow
with gravel Saturday in order to prepare the site for pouring the concrete foundation
Tuesday. Anyone interested in working can get applications from the Union or the
library, turn them in and wait to be contacted. Wildcat Habitat would be thrilled to
have more people on the building team.

Students have problems
with housing for ‘96-‘97

By NaresH NAGELLA
Assistant News Editor

Twenty juniors, three groups
of women and one group of men,
did: not come up With the lucky
numbers in Phase I of the RLO
Room Lottery.

Those juniors planned on
speniding senior year in one of the
18 five-bedroom apartments avail-
able for housing. However, as

usual, many people signed up for .

those spaces, leaving four groups
of five friends with some tough
decisions to make.

According to Assistant Di-
rector of Residence Life Debbie
Young, most people usually desig-
nate a person out of the five “that
will take a single in the event of not
getting the apartment.”

She says students “should be

prepared with another plan since
they are told that no one is guaran-
teed to get a five-bedroom apart-
ment.” i

Junior David Kneen and his
group of five were left out of an
apartment. However, Kneen says,
“We have three other friends who
don’t mind splitting into a two
groups of four, so we should all be
able to cluster. We are not too
disappointed and still are very ex-
cited about next year.”

Some of the junior women
who did not get five-bedroom
apartments were frustrated because
they had been housed down the hill
and off campus when they came
back from abroad this year.

RLO director Kurt Holmes
sees no changes.in room selection
process stating, “Returning in mid-
year has nothing to do with the

lottery. The students like the cur-
rent system and we will keep it.”

The selection process for four-
bedroom apartments was also part
of Phase I, leaving the options for
those who did not get five-person
apartments fairly limited.

Other juniors found that they
had to wait to go through lottery
because they were rooming with
current sophomores, despite the
fact that these sophomores already
have lower lottery numbers.

Holmes says that the inherent
problems in allowing four and five-
bedroom apartments to be chosen
in Phase I probably will not be
fixed, stating “It was the desire of
the students during the building of
Martin Court F (to choose rooms
in that manner). Phase II is de-
signed to accomodate juniors (who
want to room with seniors).”
