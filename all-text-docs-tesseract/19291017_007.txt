and That

Music
By

Horace W. Erwin

The power of enjoying and loving the

of

enough to prefer order to incoherence.
—-W. HADOW.

The college band has recently become reci-
pient to the generous sum of $200, which has
been donated by an interested alumnus who
prefers to conceal his identity, with the under-
standing that it be appropriated to the pur-
chase of trousers to match the now trouser-
less uniforms of the band members. Our
beneficent donor, happened to be present at
the Elon game, was heartily pleased with the
music furnished by the band, but was quick
to detect that the uniforms worn, although
brilliant and well-suited to occasion, were
incomplete as to trousers. Upon which he
determined to supply the need.

This generous gift, supplying as it does
their sartorial deficiency, is primarily import-
ant to the band members. And yet it is not
without significance to the college at large,
and especially to those backing the progress
of things musical at Davidson. The dona-
tion is more than an event, however; it is a
clear indication of three facts. It shows. in
the first place that music is fast assuming
its place as a participant in school functions,
such as football games. The organ solos in
daily chapel, likewise, make music a salient
feature of the service. Again, it shows that
musical activities commence to attract. the
attention of outsiders, as the presence of a
band in the stadium. Thirdly, it predicts that
musical groups are coming into recognition
as fitting recipients of financial aid and en-
couragement by alumni and friends of the
school,

It is apparent that many of the friends of
Davidson can be made to see that there are
many possibilities here in the line of music.
For it is not impracticable for musical talent,
though cidle, and musical interest, though
dormant, to be reviewed and put to use pro-
fitably. Such a movement, however, would
require interest, encouragement, and support.

In many colleges a course in vocal art,
giving academic credit, is open to members
of the glee club, Duke and Guilford in North
Carolina and Furman in South Carolina are
three proximate institutions where that prac-
tise obtains. Needless to say, such glee clubs
are greatly enabled to better their perform-
ances. Patronage is given the R. O. T. C.
band by the United States government, which
furnishes many band instruments, provided
also the college will complement the num-
ber furnished. These instruments may be
used by students ouside of military work
throughout their college years.

The work of our own concert orchestra, on
the other hand, is retarded by a lack of
symphonic instruments, such as a bass voil,
a ’cello, perhaps a viola, an.oboe, and tym-
panies. The addition of these instruments to
our number would make orchestral work
feasible. The tendency toward jazz is so
pronounced only because jazz is the only
channel into which college musicians can
turn their ability and attention. And as long
as there aren’t instruments owned by the
college to produce symphonic music adequ-
ately, there will always be an abundance of
jazz orchestras using instruments easier to
learn and cheaper to buy. ;

But with support by the college in the sub-
sidy of instruments, interest in good music
will be kindled. By the addition of simply a
‘cello and viola, a string quartet or a string
ensemble could be easily formed, which would
do much to acquaint interested students with
the charm and beauty of chamber music. And
perhaps there are other combinations and
musical projects to be formed, but which
await incentive and support.

Sandy MacPherson was travelling to
Glasgow, and on the way he felt thirsty,
so he took out a bottle and drew the cork.
Just as he was about to take a taste, a
fellow-passenger in clerical garb address-
ed him:

“Excuse me, sir, but I am sixty-five
years of age, and I have never tasted a
drop of whiskey.”

“Dinna worry yersel’,’ came back
Sandy, “you're not going to start now.”

Section fifteen had been allotted to the
Davidson alumni, and this section was full
from top to bottom with loyal sons of

their eyes were focused on eleven red-

to build and maintain schools, and every
agency that develops the intellect is backed
by the Church. Don’t be afraid of education.
You will never be as smart as the One who
unfolds the Heavens.

“A fourth thought must be given to the
soul. A man who is going to bring God into
his life is the real man. The man who has
religious faith sees a spiritual world, and he
is not a real man until he knows about im-
mortality. The great need of America today
is a revival of religion for the purpose of
thinking directly about God.”

In concluding his talk, Doctor Henderlite
pointed out that the final analysis would be
found in the words: ‘“Wanted—A Christian.”

Methinks that there is nothing more
impressive in the history of the School
than the columns which stood in front of
Chambers for so many years. To those
who recall the memory of bright moonlit
nights and a ghostly aurora about their
tall heights there is brought a tinge of
Romance that is irradicable. New Cham-
bers is possibly, more beautiful now than
it was before, but the thrill of seeing rain
trickle the gaunt sides of the
columns and splash in little puddles at
the legs of those giants is a thrill which,
even though legendary, can neither be
described nor forgotten.

And so while dreaming of their beauty
lam reminded of a quaint and weird tale
that has been told around the college con-
cerning them. In 1914 W. A. Dumas de-
cided to go down into their depths and
find out what was going on below. Armed
with a flashlight he was let down. In the
dirt and mud he and finally
brought to light a grotesque skull. This
confirmed a rumor that had been passed
about for some years among the inmates
of the college. The skull was thought to
have been placed there some years ago
by a student of the North Carolina Medi-
cal School when that institution was loca-
ted at Davidson,

And so, inspiration being negligent, a
rising young senior scribbled out a poem
in honor of the skull and that lyric don-
ned the of “Archibald

“But to go back to the tale I am telling,

There came to the college the fall of one

And when they asKed him to tell what his

And so this queer young student would
go to his room and bar the door. At last
the cat (that.curiot’s one) came along and
emulated Peeping Tom by glancing cas-
ually through the keyhole. What he saw
was certainly not capable of making him
light that much-talked-of. cigarette. lor
there in the room was a table load of
gold with Archibald gloating over
spoils. Then the eagle eyed demon choked
and bit and scratched until our Archibald

Then this naughty little lamb runs away
not leaving his gold behind him, but leav-
ing a walking, talking ghost instead.

“Some night perhaps when you're walk-
ing through Chambers,

You'll feel a wind that is icy and cold.

Something will touch you—'twill be wet

Something will whisper, “Oh where is my

Down to supper and am reminded of
the two freshmen who quarrelled over an
extra piece of pie. They couldn’t seem to
settle the “pied” argument in any other
way so they resorted to the ancient art
of fisticuff. But the devil came-into that

freshman who ate 6f the forbidden fruit
and spoiled a darn good fight. Like the

Out to look at the campus in its cloth
of green and am considerably jolted by
the realization that freshmen take to
green, ec. g. That entire class, it seems,
was gathered under the trees to have
their fair mugs printed on the celluloid.
Huh, is it a coincidence that all these
reminiscent thoughts deal with the ser-
pent in the Garden? Well, anyhow the
sophomore stept up with nearly
every fire bucket of the hill, and several

And so to bed with serious thoughts
concerning that Davidson alumnus who
put off his wedding to play golf with the
time-worn Seotch Professor.
