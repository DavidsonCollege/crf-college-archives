out giving the entire plot away,
let me say briefly that Sophie's
Choice is a story about a Polish
Catholic survivor of Auschwitz,
Sophie Zawistowka; her ex-
tremely intelligent but mentally
erratic Jewish lover, Nathan
Landau (who cannot forgive her
for surviving the death camp in
which so many Jews perished);
and the narrator, Stingo, a
struggling young Southern wri-
ter who creates the third point
of an unbalanced triangle by
falling lustfully in love with
Sophie.

Stingo meets the unfortunate
couple in a Brooklyn boarding
house in the summer of 1947
when he takes a room beneath

‘that of Sophie and Nathan and

is kept awake by the amorous
creaking of their bedsprings.

As the summer wears on, the
relationships and interplay be-
tween the three intensify, and
Sophie feels more’and more the
need to unburden the story of
her past and her fears about
Nathan to some supposedly
objective outsider. It is Stingo
to whom she turns, spilling out
her horror story in broken
English.

The story Stingo tells (writ-
ten somewhat later than 1947
but never specified) is of hes
growth and journey to partial
understanding of the terrible,
baffling evil of the Holocaust —
and his return to what can never
be quite a normal world again.

The book is basically a novel

The character of Stingo, the

after the young William Styron. -

And the basic idea for Sophie's
Choice came from a real, incid-
ent. Styron told James Atlas of
The New York Times Book

depress salaries, Spencer shid,
yet he added, “We should not
take advantage of the.fact that
the market is so unfavorable for
academic people.”’

Spencer offered no solutions
to the problem, saying that
future salary levels depend
mostly on the economy. He did
predict that ‘Something will
certainly be done at the Feb-
ruary Trustees’ meeting, butI
don’t know: what.”’

Spencerr said he does not feel
the decline in the faculty’s.real
income has affected Davidson's
quality of education. He said he
does possibly foresee a decline
in educational quality by losing
good new professors to univer-
sities.”” On the whole, however,
Spencer feels Davidson’s educa-
tional quality will stay close to
its present level.

‘‘Faculty morale is low across
the country.’’ Spencer said Yet
he feels Davidson’s goal should
be to “stay even with the best
colleges in the country.”

Religion Professor David
Kaylor said that although sala-
ry. levels have not yet hurt
Davidson's academic quality,
“If this downward trend con-
tinues over the long run it will
have a very detrimental effect
on the educational program.”
Kaylor said he has already
detected a decline in faculty
morale due to the decline in
real faculty income.

Kaylor explained that “The

faculty is much less convinced
that the College is really doing
as much as it can for the
faculty. The faculty feels unap-
preciated..”

Kaylor noted that the College

new professors away from large
