CATS LOSE STADIUM

lith officials of both schoi in a hubbub, and the com
mittee in charge of the American Legion Stadium in hot water,
it looks as if Davidson has’come out on the short, end of the
situation. After Davidson-Wake [Forest football games were
not-rescheduled by Davidson last year both schools claimed the

use of the Stadium for Thanksgiving games after this’ year.
After much wrangling and legal red tape plus official discus-
sion, the stadium rights were given to Wake Forest, which will

greatly alter. Davidson 4 for Turkey D:
‘Both schools appeared to have the stadium, but
seems that the solution was not fair at all to Davidson, since
is so much closer to’ Charlotte than Wake Forest, and since

Davidson interests are so much nearer to Charlotte people. It

is the case of an outsider coming in with legal technicalities to |

take away the just rights of Davidson in this:matter.

While Davidson officials dickered with the chairman of
the committee in charge, Wake Forest representatives
came up with the statement that the committee itself had
contracted to give all rights to them and a Charlotte court
upheld Wake Forest’s claim; .thus Davidson lost a place
to play Thanksgiving games, when it was believed that
everything was being settled favorably.

All of which brings ts to the tact that the Wideats—are
minus, their traditional setting for the future Turkey Day
games,-and if the games are held, at Davidson will have to,com-
pete with another big game in Charlotte every year,«which

will hurt attendance. tremendously. This action may force
Davidson to.move to some nearby town. such as Winston-
Salem or Greensboro forthe game, in which ease itwill appear
doubly foolish for the Cats to travel up-country while Wake
Forest takes over home-territory. }

SHORT SHOTS FROM SATURDAY
Stan Yoder was the. defensive star of the game, rambling |
all over the.field to make consistently hard tackles .°.. Dave
Spencer’s lightning thrusts through the air in tle last half |
looked good, and his punting kept the Cats out of trouble time
and again... Bob Johnson and Bill Bolin were victims of
terrifically hard blocks while chasing Carolina backs on a pass |
interception and punt returns. Both came up ready tor more |
though .. . Lalanne lacked, the magical arm that carrie] all |
but three passes to completion last year, as‘he fell to-a Sixty |
per cent average. The sweet one-also looked. bad when he|
called for a fair catch with no Davidson man near him . ; .|
General George Stirnweiss with a banged-up leg and water-on
the-knee didn’t look as good against the Cats as George Mc-
Afee several weeks back, Saturday, However, both should be|
ready, and-it-will-be_a-battle-te_the-finhish
Lalanne were tackled plenty hard after passin
tinued to get up unhurt appatently. Lalanne seems to have |
mainly stopped jumping before passing as he did last year. . A
Granville Sharpe had some more nice tackles from his safety |
man post, as he has done all year . . . Spencer’s and Sharpe’s |
passes.to Yoder in the flat looked,good. We still want to see |
Stan get a chance to get under full steam ‘after one of those, |
which chance he hasn’t had ds yet... The Tar Heel receivers
took the glory fgom others as they fought off Wildcat de-
fenders to snag that rock time and. again... Davidson’s out-
Weighed team again played hard ball all the way against hope-
less odds... :

Carolina's shifty back, George Radman (97) sweeps right end after a reverse for a first-down in last
Saturday’s game. Caught in the midst of a neat cross-step Radman drove on until/ Stan Yoder (44) pulled
him down. A Carolina back clears the way with a vicious block on a would-be Davidson tackler, as Bob
Smith (28). follows the play from the other side. Radman later was forced out of the game with a knee
injury as Carolina defeated the Cats 32-0 in Winston-Salem. (Staff photo by Angus Lytch).
