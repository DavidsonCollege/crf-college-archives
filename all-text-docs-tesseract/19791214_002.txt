other jobs. In fact, Kaylor said
some are already doing so.

“If no change takes place
then unionization is possible,”
Kaylor added. “‘A few years ago
unionization would not have
been possible, but now I don’t
think it’s so unthinkable.”

Kaylor pointed out that some
faculty members are quite close
to being eligible for government
housing and school lunch pro-

ulty compensation, whereas in
1978 only 32.6% was assigned
for compensation, according to

- the AAUP report. The Educa-

tional/General Expenditures
makes up approximately 70%
of the total budget.

Compared with schools with
which it competes for students,
Davidson is behind in nearly
every case in terms of compen-
sation percentage, Kaylor said.
He added that those who are
behind are catching up.

NEH gives $500,000 challenge grant

By MARK BARRETT
News Editor

The National Endowment for
the Humanities (NEH) has
given Davidson a $500,000
challenge grant.

Under the grant’s terms,
NEH will match every $3 the
College raise before Ture 1983
with $1 of its own, up to the
$500,000 maximum.

The grant must help fund
humanities-related projects. In
a college news release College
President Samuel Spencer was
quoted, “This significant grant,
combined with the funds which

elements in our Davidson 1987
Program.”

The program, which sets a
$35 million goal in fund raising
by 1987, is designed to fund
construction projects as well as
to endow professorships, scho-
larships, and library support.

Lee explained that all of the
NEH money will be channeled
into faculty and library funds,
not into construction.

The NEH is a government
agency established to sponsor
scholarship in the humanities
and programs which make
works in the humanities avail-
able to the general public.
