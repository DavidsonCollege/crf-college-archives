Rugby Takes Duke in Incredibly Hasy Fashion

It was a cold and muddy day
on the Upper IMAC fields, and a
miserable one for the Duke Blue
Devils as the Davidson College
Rugby team put the pitchfork in
the Devils’ witha final score of 20-
i

The game began with Duke
moving deftly to the try zone, only
to be stopped dead in their tracks
by the Wildcats whotook that threat
as a challenge and never looked
back. A few minutes later George
Williams made a brilliant run, set
up perfectly by Kelly Shirley, to
the try zone. Davidson continued
to dominate in all aspects of play.
The most amazing play of the day
came from Tom Shelburne when
hesingle-handedly blocked a Duke
punt, scooping it up and carrying it
20 meters for the second try of the
day. Jamie Brown converted both
tries, and added two penalty kicks,
thus claiming half of Davidson’s
points.

The Davidson team has finally
recovered from the crippling ill-

fected play all semester. With this
game, the Wildcats have shown
that they are still one of the leading
teams in North Carolina Rugby
and that even the ACC teams are
really no match for their talent.
The entire team played an amazing
game, rucking hard and winning
almost every scrum down. The
back line ran very well, but more
noticeably, their defensive play was
unerring, holding the Duke team
on several goal line stands. The
team as a whole allowed only one
try by Duke, and it occurred late in
the second half.

Although every individual
played extremely well, several de-
serve honorable mention. Bob
Yarbrough played dauntlessly in
his first game ever at the scrum
half position. The team expects
him to become one of the best
scrum halves in the state. Kelly
Shirley performed flawlessly at
fullback, a position in which he is
very unexperienced. Billy Hendrix
ran and tackled beautifully in his

Edwin Thomas saved a Duke try
by himself. Jamie Brown and Tag
Kleineralso playedextremely well
in the defensive backfield. The
scrum, as usual, was invincible,
led by the experience, size, and
strength of David Rozelle, Patrick
Malcor, Tom Shelburne, Scotch
Turner, Rafael Candelario, Wyatt
Lilly, and “Menacing Mike”
Kessler. Chance Reynolds and
Philip Parks played brilliantly, in
spite of the fact that they are rela-
tively new to the game. Dave
Harding, in his final game ever at
Davidson College; played, as al-
ways, with more intensity than is
humanly possible. He will be
missed greatly by the team.

After the first game, Duke
wanted to try again, so there was a
full scale B-side game. Here again
Davidson showed no mercy,
mushing mashing, androlling over
the Devils toa 17-7 victory. Rafael
Candelario continued his excel-
lent line out jumping and added a
try to his stats. Doctor Coppola set

Walk-on
Alpert Making
Great Strides
at Point Guard

By Bob Pascal

What 5' 11" Long Island na-
tive is making serious waves in the
Southern Conference this year? His
name is Chris Alpert and he is
Coach McKillop’s choice for start-
ing point guard. Alpert has worked
hard to get where he is and it has
notcome easy. Recently, Isatdown
with him and discussed his basket-
ball origins and how this year has
gone on and off the court.

In referring to his first start as
a freshman walk-on on a Division
I squad: “I was a little nervous. . .
but once you get out there you
forget about everything: else.”
Davidson’s opponents, however,
will have a tough time forgetting
about Alpert, as he continues to
improve every time he takes the
court. Alpert comes to us by way
of Chaminade, the same high
school that graduated Coach Bob
McKillop, and Mount Hermon
Prep where Alpert’s post graduate
team went undefeated and seven
of his teammates are now also play-
ing college basketball.

At Davidson he has had to
adapt to a new world. Basketball
in high school is one thing and in
college quite another. I asked him
about the transition between the
two: “At prep school it was very
easy. . .the games were easy, we
won every game by at least twenty
points and I wound up playing
only halfa game. This has been my
most challenging year, going
throughacollege schedule- twenty-
five to thirty games, night in and
night out playing guys that are
probably better than you, it’s a
struggle every time we go out, as it
is for both teams.”

Alpert also had to adapt to a

completely new set of teammates,
but he says that the responsiveness
of the players and coaches and the
fact that they do not treat him or
Tim Caldwell any differently as
walk-ons, “has made me feel real
comfortable and the adjustment
much easier.” Amazingly enough,
Alpert is one of only two walk-ons
in Division I basketball to be start-
ing, an even more impressive feat
when one considers that Alpert is
only a freshman.

He clearly has an incredibly
positive feeling about his team-
mates and coaches. Alpert de-
scribes the team as a Close knit

group of individuals brought to-
gether through shared good times
and bad. When asked how he felt
about the coaching staff he replied:
“Tlove the coaches very much, and
Irespect them all, especially Coach
McKillop. He is a great coach as
well as a really great guy and I
really enjoy playing for him.”
Alpert has been very excited
with the team’s play this year. He
stated, “a nice mix of veterans and
freshmen has put together a nice
season.” Alpert feels that a South-
em Conference win andabid to the

ETSU; Clinches Fifth

Whata difference aday makes.
The Davidson basketball team re-
bounded last Sunday from perhaps
its most trying loss of the season, a
79-76 decision at the hands of
Appalachian State the day before,
by whipping second-place East
Tennessee State 90-75 at Belk
Arena.

It was the final home game for
Wildcat seniors Detlef Musch, J.D.
Heuer and Matt Matheny, all of
whom started the game, so it was
only fitting that one of them set the
tone for the afternoon. It turned out
to be Musch. He scored on a dunk
and a hook shot to give Davidson a
4-2 lead, and after that the ‘Cats
never trailed. But it was just the
Start of a twenty minute frenzy for
Musch, who scored 18 points in
the first half, and finished with 19.
With 4:13 leftin the half, he took a
pass from Jason Zimmerman and
finished the fast break with a one-
handed jam to make it 43-29.
Davidson led 47-37 at the half.

The Bucs made their run mid-
way through the second half, cut-
ting a 16-point deficit to nine with
a 10-3 run. Jason Niblett’s three-
pointer with 11:24 left made it 61-
52. But Jeff Anderson’s baseline
drive fora layup started Davidson’s
response, and once initiated it was
swift and final. Heuer’s three-
pointer with 5:06 left capped a 17-
4 run that gave the Wildcats their
largest lead at 78-56.

McKillop commented on the
team's ability to bounce back. “I’m
just delighted with the character
our kids showed today,” he said.
“Tt was an emotional loss, a drain-
ing loss [against Appalachian], and
the way we played start to finish
today is a real statement of the
character that has evolved on this
basketball team.”

On Saturday afternoon in Hun-
tington, WV, Davidsonclinched at
least a tie for fifth place in the
conference with a 63-57 win over
Marshall. It was the Wildcats first
road win since January 6 and the
thundering herds first loss in 12
home games this year.

Davidson took a 30-28 lead at
halftime on Zimmerman’s three
point play with 33 seconds to play.
The points put Zimmerman over
the 1000 point mark for his career.

The ‘Cats opened the second
half with a quick run. A screen
broke Alpert free for a lay-up on
the inbounds play to start the half
and Musch and Narat scored to
make it 36-28 with 18:33 left.
Davidson won led with 15:01 left.

But Marshall came back, and
was ready to bust down the door,
down just 51-49 when Zimmerman
won the game with his defense. On
consecutive possesions near the
six minute mark he stopped
Marshall fast breaks by drawing a _
charge. Musch, who finished with
24, then scored six straight to put
the Wildcats clear.

Said Zimmerman,” You could
see they didn’t have any attention
to pass the ball. It wasn’t a thing I
even thought about. I just stepped
in front.” Musch added“It’s just
coming together for us.‘

Sunday afternoon in Lexing-
ton, VA, Davidson used foul shoot-
ing and big games from Musch and
Zimmerman to beat VMI, 84-70,
Davidson led only 74-70 with2:18,
but on the next possesion, Musch
twice rebounded his own misses
and scored to make it 76-70.
Zimmerman followed with four
free throws, and Quinn Harwood
made two to put the game out of
¥each. Musch scored a career high .

30 points, and Zimmerman added

21 for the Wildcats.
