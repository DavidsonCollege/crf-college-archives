centage of members and

a special -certificate of recog-
nition by the National Red
Cross.

Lamond said that he feels the
Davidson student body will again
rally in support of this blood drive
in seeing the continued need for

blood. ;

He continued, “Tt is little enough
to ask of us that we give a little
of our time, and perhaps suffer
some slight inconvenience in order
that we may have the opportunity
to help save a life. We never know
but what we may someday be in
a position in which, our life -may
depend on the willingness of some-
one to give a little time and a pint
of blood. If we can picture our-
selves in such.a situation, I know
that each of us will be eager to
donate.”

(Continued from Page Two)
thirteen thousand of whom sailed

for the foreign mission field.

The twenties and thirties were
marked ‘by confusion and decline
in both the general Student Chris-
tian Movement and in the mis-
sionary program of the churches.
Accordingly the work and influence
of the Movement greatly decreased.
By 1940 only a small Staff re-
mained and both the objectives and
relationships of the Movement had
become less clear. Then the Second
World War.

In the recent years there has
been a renewed interest in SVM,
evidenced by the Quadrennia!l Con-
vention of 1952, and the united
desire of two thousand students,
from the United States and forty-
five foreign countries, that God will
revive that which has grown stale.
Shortly after the convention, sev-
eral Davidson students met to
form an SVM chapter on this cam.
pus, Even though the national SVM
has a statement of purpose, it was
felt by this group that it should
formulate its own. The purpose
centers generally around the aims
of effectively witnessing to and
for the redeeming work of Christ
and also by study and prayer to
encourage students in meeting the
challenge of the Cliristian World
Mission effort.

It is the hope of this SVM group
that. great things will be done on
this cainpus in the realization of
these purposes. It calls on all men

interested to attend its bi-monthly

meetings whenever possible, and
it also solicits the prayer of all
students who are concerned with
its progress,

Exhibit On Egypt
In Chambers Lobby

A photographic exhibition of
Egypt, prepared by the editors of
Life Magazine, will go on display
tomorrow at Davidson College.

The exhibition, which will be dis-
played in the lobby of Chambers
Building, contains the most recent
photographs of remaining art mon-
uments from an Egyptian culture
that flourished for 3,000 years be-
fore Christ.

Tt includes some 50 photographs
by Life Photographer Eliot Eliso-
fon taken while on an assignment
in the Nile Valléy. The subject
matter is from the Old and New
Kingdoms, and ranges from the ma-
jestic simplicity of the Seep Py-
ramid of King Djoser (2780-2761
B.C.) to the Great Temple of
Hathor at Dendera. which was
built during the first century B.C,
under the Roman Emperor Augus-
tus. :

A series of three panels is de-
voted to several unusually fine
teliefs uncovered in 1941, and not
hitherto widely lnown: reliefs in
the tomb of swe Royal Scribe
Kheruef in Western Thebes.

The exhibition is based on the
photogreohic essay, Art of Egypt,
which agpezred in Life in 1948,
atlhough it is greatly enlarged in
scope, and includes much material
that has never been published.

It was assembled under the di-
rection of W. C. Hayes of the De-
partment of Egyptology at Metro-
politan Muscum of Art in New
York City.
