THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 27, 1932

Death of a Friend

Mrs. W. C. Wright, honored sister
of our beloved Mrs. N. T. Smith,
passed away on the 22nd of December
at her home*in Winston-Salem.

Mrs. Wright was known and. loved
by many Davidson associates and our
hearts extend deepest s:4mpathy to
M:s. Smith and to the family.

“Yes, Dr. Rightmire has a conviction,”
mented the student publication. “Perhaps. We
will know definitely when he makes an open and

The issue in another editorial said: “We feel
that some explanation for the publication of
this magazine against the advice of the admin-

“If we seem to pour salt on already festered
wounds it is only because we desire to maintain
principles that are worth fighting for.

“The attitude of the administration toward

adverse to deter the Liberal Club from under-

taking an enterprise of the naturé of the New
