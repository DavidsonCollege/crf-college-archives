THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)
An Honor System In Despair

The remainder of this page is ample
evidence that the Honor System and
regulations at Davidson College is
sorely in need of clarification, co-
ordination and revision.

Even a cursory glance of the letters
to the editor shows that students have
widely conflicting conceptions of the
system and how it works, the Honor
Court and its procedures.

The Honor Court chairman, him-
Self, admits on this page that the
court is forced under the present sit-
uation to contradict the letter of the
law in order to remain true to the
spirit of the law.

These two matters are not some-
thing to be passed off casually. The
Davidson Honor System and Student
Body Regulations face a more serious
problem than most students or facul-
ty realize. The rules in many cases
are vague, often meaningless. Ob-
stacles confront the court in attempts
to promote and enforce a true spirit
of honor. The limits of its jurisdiction
and the application of the rules are
matters of varying opinions.

Davidson students have contribut-
ed their part to the overall weakening
of the system. True, it may work
better than the one at Carolina or
W. & L: or wherever, but the fact
cannot be escaped that the situation
here is far from ideal.

Students will steal a towel or other
P. E. equipment from a classmate in
the locker room without a second
thought—though they might never
steal at the dorms.

Students ‘will “casually” discuss
ROTC writs or hint to friends what
items to study—thougi they might
never cheat on the hill.

Students will sign their names to
misstatements of facts on official
forms or lab cards—though they
might never lie under oath. |

We cannot rationalize these distinc-
tions which have become so prevalent
here. The Honor System should be
just what its name implies. Its inter-
pretation was never meant to be re-
stricted to the “letter,” rather than the
“spirit,” of the law.

We wholeheartedly endorse and
support the 1961 Court in its efforts to
break this fetter and others that bind
it. It should and does have powers of
interpretation which are well estab-
lished by precedent and statement of
purpose when ‘formed.

Yet, as Harrison Wellford points
out in this issue, the hands of the
court are still bound unwillingly by
the arbitrary dismissal rule. Though
all the above illustrations are honor
offenses, all do not merit so drastic a

punishment. Thus, the court, in fair-

The ASC's Offer

A controversy of sorts was stirred

up by our editorial of last week on
academic scheduling and the ever-
present exam problem. We apologize
for a typographical error (see else-
where on this page) which may have
confused some. But most of all we
apologize for committing a newspaper-
man’s worst fault: failing to check the
veracity of information he receives.

We were told that we had been on
a six-day first semester exam sched-
ule for the past three years. Without
even trying to recall, we assumed this
information was correct. Reader Car-
rell caught us, and sure enough—we
have had eight-day exam periods for
at least the past four years, informa:
tion from the Academic Scheduling
‘Committee notwithstanding.

There has also been some confusion
over the meaning of the term “eight-
day schedule.” This merely means
that exams are given on a total of
eight days during the period; usually
a Sunday breaks up the pattern.

We are still in favor of a shorter
exam schedule. This semester is a
golden opportunity to try out a new
and potentially good system. It also
still seems obvious that a permanent
exam schedule, set up with careful
study, would solve many problems.

This week President Martin an-
nounced that the Student Council has
the power to select a student to offer
suggestions on the planning of next
year’s calendar. We are glad that an

ness to the defendant, contradicts it-
self by trying him under student reg-
ulations, not the Honor System.

We realize that the present rule
should be brought to bear in many
cases involving the three honor of-
fenses specified: stealing, lying under
oath and cheating. Yet in a system of
honor, administered by a court of
honor, there is no need for such bind-
ing restrictions in all cases. Leeway
must be provided within the Honor
System for other violations of basic
dishonesty meriting varying degrees
of punishment and cases of unusual
extenuating circumstances. Students
and the court have every right to re-
quest a thorough study and overhaul
of the present system.

The Executive Committee has al-
ready been approached on several
more technical, but still highly import-
ant, areas of confusion and contradic-
tion. We hope they will respond. to
the plea for clarity in matters like the
following: .

What is the definition of gambling,
which calls for possible suspension in
student body rules and ordinarily dis-
missal in faculty rules?

Is the campus defined as the town
limits or the area bounded by Concord
and Main? If the former, how does the
possession or drinking of alcoholic
beverages apply to students not living
in dorms, or those who pass through
Davidson with. alcohol in their posses-
sion, though they never stop.

Should fraternity officers sfill be
required to sign a pledge (official
document) following each dance week-
end that he has not seen any. drinking
or effects of drinking on the campus,
when the student body has divested
itself of responsibility as regards un-
der the influence?

What is more, how closely does the
college interpret its rule on alcohol
connected with off campus events and
how willing is it to enforce this rule?

We ask each of you to read the
Honor System and Student Body Reg-
‘ulations as they appear on page 5 of
this issue. Then read the faculty rules
of student conduct found in the Wild-
cat Handbook. Finally, ask any three
persons on campus their conception
of the system and the court's job—
most likely you'll get three answers,
just as four views are found in the
four letters this week. No more need
be said—you understand the problem.

Our current program of education
must be extended to a campus-wide
evaluation, to be followed by positive
action. The present situation, unchang-
ed, will only continue to breed hypro-
crisy, injustice and misunderstanding.

Of A Chance?

effort is being made to hear student
opinion. (See story on page one.)

However, we are appalled at the
number of reservations and limita-
tions put upon this student voice.
What does the Academic Scheduling
Committee discuss that tender student
ears cannot hear, and must be labeled
confidential? And why all this cloak-
and-dagger secrecy to keep any hints
of the committee’s deliberation from
the prying eyes of DAVIDSONIAN
staff members? Must we, too, be kept
in the dark concerning what purports
to be important. discussion?

We do not think a student needs
to vote, but he needs to be abic to
discuss freely and to be in on the
fruition of final plans. If there is to
be student representation. let him be
given fair and equal chance to rep-
resent.

In the Jight of the controversy and
confusion over exams and over the
entire school calendar, we would like
to propose that the Academic Sched-
uling Committee take a poll of student
body opinion, and of faculty opinion,
on certain specific questions: Does the
faculty/student body favor a shorter
exam schedule? A later return date in
September? A full week’s vacation be-
fore Christmas? An early commence-
ment?

By finding out the answers to these
perennial questions we might see a
new approach or get a fresh idea on
a tired problem. DBS

In this second article of a

Honor System, I would like to
discuss the dismissal rule. The

Dear Editor:

It seems most unfortunate
that a newcomer of only three
weeks at Davidson has in such
a short time embraced so many
drastic misconceptions about
our Honor System.

Mr. Papra emphatically states
that the Honor Court should
judge each case on its individ-
ual merit, implying that this
procedure has not been followed
in the past; yet he then states
that the Court should not be

able to interpret the spirit of.

the law involved.

This is in itself a basic con-
tradiction. Only by interpreting
the spirit of the law can the
Honor Court consider each case
individyally; otherwise each
case would be placed in a rigid
category with the same punish-
ment for each offense under a
particular rule, with no regard
for exténuating circumstances
involved.

To illustrate, the Honor Court,
because of the dismissal re-
quirement in the Constitution
for all offenses tried under the
Honor Systein. has been forced
to try oertain cases with valid
extenuating circumstances un-
der the Student Body Regula-
tions where degrees of punish-
ment do exist, even though the
case may logically have belong:
ed under the Honor System.

By taking. such action, the
Honor Court remained truc to
the spirit of the Honor System
by avoiding unjust punishment
to an offender. Mr. Papra’s
statement that the Honor Court
does not take into consideration
extenuating circumstances is
simply a mis-statement of fact.

Mr. Papra further implies that
the Honor Court's jurisdiction
over stealing offenses prevents
the plaintiff from whom an ob-
ject has been stolen from press:
ing further charges in ea regular
criminal court. This implication,
of course, is not true.

The Honor Court, under the
Student Body Constitution, must

college no matter how blame

of a systém of honor run on the
basis of basic right and wrong.
If the compulsory dismissal
rule remains unmodified, the
court will feel very hesitant to
bring other cases under the

cluded in the representative

tution and which have not been
emphasized as thoroughly as
lying, cheating, and stealing.

MUST DEAL FIRMLY

turned up several extenuating
circumstances that acted in the
student's favor. The fact that a
student was pledged to go
through all required procedures
before recording his results had
not been made sufficiently
clear; laboratory conditions
were primitive to a degree that
accurate results were inordin-
ately difficult to obtain; and it
had become almost general
practice among students in this
Jab to “fudge” to achieve any
correct results.

Under these conditions, the
Honor Court did not feel that
it was in keeping with the real
purpose of the Honor System
to try this case where the only
possible punishment was dis:
missal.

The Honor Court, in order to
uphold the Honor System, must
and will deal firmly with any
act which involves basic! dis-
honesty regardless of the speci-
fie form which it may take. In
order to make the penalty most
justly fit the erime, the court
may be compelled to try some
of these. cases under Student
Body Regulations where there
are degrees of punishment
rather than under the Honor
System ‘where perhaps they be-
long technically. \

Therefore, the Honor Court
tried the case under Student
Body Regulations where degrees
of punishment are possible.

Technically the Honor System
had been broken. yet the court
was forced to act in contradic-
tion to the dictates of techni-
eality. in order 1o render the
most humane, just decision and
keep the spirit of the Honor
System.

There is no easy solution for
this problem. If the compulsory
dismissal rule is modified, some
observers. lacking confidence in
a student court's ability to dis-
miss a fellow student if not
compelled to do so, feel that
modification would weaken the
system.

NO DEGREES

The Honor System, as it now
stands. rests on the doctrine
that there are no degrees of
guilt in an offense involving a  Qthers-fecl that ‘the dismissal

altogether. Perhaps somewhere
there is a just and - workable
medium: the student govern-

this doctrine. If a man. acts
dishonorably and breaks an
hoiior rule, there is no degree to

breach of conduct, as there is
a degree to which a man may

We wish to express our views
on these subjects from the point
of view of two who have wit-

Mr. Papra’s ideas can be
classified under these headings:
his attack on the operation of
the Honor Court, his attack on
the effectiveness and purpose of
the Honor System at Davidson
College, and his proposed
changes in both the Court and
the system.

Sweeping changes are indeed
needed in this archaic system
that works not so much on the
concept of honor, but on that of
fear.

The present system, with its
refusal to recognize the éxis-
tence of extenuating circum-
stances, and its rendering of

sumption that one bad apple in its decislons. and that it-does
