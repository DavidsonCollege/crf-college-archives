Movie Advance

The picture for this week will be a pro-
duction of Rex Beach’s famous novel “The
Spoilers.” It is a stirring photoplay of the
historic clash that occured in the Klondike
gold region when crooked politicians tried to
rob the miners of their properties. It pic-
tures vividly the adventures, hardships, and
rampant greed and the devotion which were
so forcibly brought out among the people
taking part in this great gold rush.

The best known of the cast of this picture
include Milton Sills, Anna Q. Nillson, Noah
Beery, Ford Sterling and Louise Fazenda.
The superb cast coupled with the story make
“The Spoilers” one of the outstanding fea-
ture pictures of the year. It is exciting and
entertaining from start to finish with a
sprinkle of comedy running through it, and

tempted to auction off the:college to a
blushing young girl, D. B. Walthall, and
a fruit vender, H. M. White. Needless
to say he was not very successful.

The next act was entitled Darktown
Delights. It was a little vaudeville show
in itself and was »presided over by
Piggy Martin. The first event was an
exhibition three-round boxing match be-
tween two contestants of the darker
color impersonated by R. R. Jones and
A. F. Simpson. The end of the scrap
was disastrous, for both of the fighters
were knocked out. Cupid Love and Buf-
falo McKinnon next regidered “Nobody
Knows How Green I Am.” This was fol-
lowed by a singing and dancing act ar-
ranged by the Kiser Twins. W. W.
Kiser did some good dancing, while
W. B. Kiser accompanled him with the
guitar. They then sang a song, “My
Father’s Comical Mule.” Following this

‘WILDCATS MEET BAPTISTS ON

WEARN FIELD SATURDAY)

the coming Saturday the Wildcat |
eleven will journey to Charlotte to play the |
Baptist aggregation on Wearn field, the |
scene of the tie that was inflicted by Wake |
Forest last year.

The Wake Forest team seems to be in
| Bettst shape and working more smoothly
than last year in spite of the fact that they
have a comparatively new line-up. Heckman,
who has proved Davidson’s jinx in more than
one past encounter is gone. It was he who
hurled the pass high over the Davidson
| safety man’s head, to be siezed by the fleet
| Baptist end and carried for the touchdown
|that tied the score in last year’s game. Day-

| On

The four attractions booked for this season
are the LaSalle Bell Ringing Quartet, the
Freeman Hammond Company, the Sham-
rock Trio and The Virginia Girls.

The first lyceum attraction this year is to
be the LaSalle Bell Ringing Quartet of
which it has been said, “The LaSalle Bell
Ringing Quartette are among the best of bell
players, and present a variety of selections |

that are calculated to please every taste and |
temperament found in any and every audi- |
ence.” In addition to the bell ringing fea-
ture of the program, the Quartet offers a
varied program of songs and readings.

Dates have not been announced for the
other, three performances. The Freeman
Hammond Company is a troupe of exper-
ienced actors presenting two good plays,
“The Man from Kokomo” and “Patches.”
These are first class plays and present inci- |
dents and experiences of life, sympathetically
interpreted by the actors.

The Shamrock Trio is a group of humor- |
ists and comedians. They present a clever |
Program and one that will be thoroughly en-
joyed by all. |

Very little advance dope has been received |
about the Virginia Girls, but it is certain that |
their performance will be of such magnitude
that it will draw an enthusiastic audience
from both the college and the village,

The Y. M. C. A. is fostering this lyceum
in an effort to secure funds to send delegates
to the Blue Ridge Conference of college stu-
dents next June, when Davidson hopes to be
better represented than ever before.

PANDEINICS ENJOY USUAL
DEBATE AND DECLAMATION
Two new members were received into the

Pandeiyic Literary Society at its meeting on

Oct. 9th. They were W. F. Glenn and A. F.

Simpson of the Junior class.

TRe program of the society was not espec-
ially well prepared. The debaters did not
seem to know their subjects very well, and
consequently their arguments were not es-
pecially convincing. The question for de-
bate was: Resolved, That the Towner-
Stirling Bill should be enacted in to law.
C. 'G. Affen and O'Connor debated on the.
affirmative while Garrison and: Beall upheld
the negative.
