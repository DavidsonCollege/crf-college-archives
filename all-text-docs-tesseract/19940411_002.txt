the prospective class of '98

By Jeff Fuller

Last weekend, the Davidson
community pulled together to en-
courage prospective students to ac-
cept their places in Davidson’s
Class of °98. :

The second annual Decision
Davidson weekend provided ac-
cepted students with an opportu-
nity to take a closer look at
Davidson before matriculation on
May I. It also gave the college one
last chance to show itself off be-
fore the big decisions are made.

On Saturday, 200 students and
their families filed through Baker
Sports Complex at 8:30 a.m. to
register for Decision Davidson.
Following registration, they were
given tours of the campus.

At 10 a.m., Nancy Cable
Wells, Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid, welcomed the visit-
ing students and their families to
Davidson during an opening ses-
sion held in Love Auditorium.

President Kuykendall described —

Davidson’s distinguishing charac-

teristics. Finally, Ward Davis,
Honor Council chairman, gave his
perspective on the student experi-
ence at Davidson.

Students and parents then at- ©

tended two academic interest ses-
sions of their choice in Chambers.
A professor and top student from
each department addressed aca-
demic life at Davidson.

Student life interest sessions
covering all aspects of campus life

were then conducted by represen- .

tatives from RLO, Patterson Couit,
SGA, the Union, publicity, reli-

gious life, athletics, life after |

Davidson, service, and the fresh-
man experience. While students
attended two interest sessions of
their choice, parents heard from
panels on financial aid and student
life.

with a closing luncheon held on
Chambers Front Lawn. Ambassa-

Greek Week brings houses together

By Tamara Kay Tibby

The Greek Weekend °94
marked the return of a tradition
absent from Davidson for four

years. The weekend, intended to»

unite the Patterson Court fraterni-
lics and eating houses, earned
money to benefit the Easter Seals
Foundation. Organizers were not
pleased with participation in the
event, but they believed that the
weekend laid a strong foundation
tor future successful Greek Week-
ends.

Each fraternity and eating
house was asked to sponsor an
activity. Friday’s events included
trisbee-golf sponsored by KA,
kickball sponsored by Warner Hall,
and an obstacle course sponsored
by Rusk. Saturday was also a
sports-filled day, with a volleyball
tournament, waterslide at Kappa
Sigma and an early morning Fun
~ Run sponsored by Connor and
SAE.

Rudell believes that the effective-

thus, believes next year they will
bring many improvements to the
campus.

The weekend ended with an
awards ceremony and band-and-
beer party featuring Vertical Hori-
zons on Sunday. afternoon.

CoordinatorAlan' Stump ‘be-
lieves that the weekend was as
opportunity forthe Patterson Court
houses, especially the fraternities
who are often viewed negatively
by some of the administration to
“do something foracommon goal”
and dispel fraternity stereotypes.
Stump was disappointed by the
lack of participation on the part of
some fraternities and eating houses,
but he believes that those houses
who contributed to the weekend
events had “clean fun that was
worthwhile and benefited a good

cause.”

The money raised by the
Patterson Court houses and corpo-
rate sponsors will be donated tothe

Easter ‘Seals Foundation; which" C

provides services for mentally and

physically handicapped people and _

their families.

Stump thanks those houses and
fraternities that participated as well
as Frances Bailey and other indi-
viduals who helped to coordinate
the event. Stump would like the
Greek Weekend to continue to be a
yearly tradition at Davidson. “I
urge all PCC houses to get in-
volved in next year’s activities in
order to guarantee that the week-
end willbe successful,” said Stump.

Admissions and Davidson Ambas-
sadors, including 75 student help-
ers, contributed greatly. Cassell
says the most rewarding aspect of
Decision Davidson is seeing the
students in the fall. “If I see just
one student here next year, I’Il feel
like I made a difference.”

Cable Wells commented on
the “terrific effort to assist the
Admissions Office from all cor-
ners of the campus.” She would
like to extend her own gratitude to
the entire Davidson College com-
munity for “helping to select and
matriculate the class of 1998.”
