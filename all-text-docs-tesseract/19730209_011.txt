Wildcat swimmers hit water in recent competition.

Saylor Key To Team’s Success

By JIM SIP PERSON
Sports Editor

Early in the season swim-
ming coach Ted Severn thought
breaststroker Rusty Saylor
would be one of the keys to the
success of the team this year.
So far he has been right.

Saylor broke the school
record in the 200 yard breast-
stroke in one of the first meets
of the season and looked to be
one of the steadiest performers
on the team until he was striken
by flu two weeks ago.

Since then the team has won
Onis one of three meets. an
easy win over Johnson C.
Smith Severn admitted that the
presence of a healthy Saylor
against Appalachian would not
Nave chanwed the outcome ot
that meet. but he was

nonetheless convinced that
Saylor’s leadership might have
helped the team

Saylor was entered in two
events against Appalachian and
Davidson managed to win both
but they were close races

Severn feels that the key to
Saylor’s sucess so far this vear

is due to self-discipline on
Saylor’s part.
‘He's improved tremen-

dously since last year. lowered
his times by at least 15 to 20
seconds,”’ said Severn.

“Rusty's kinda quiet, but he’s
one of our hardest workers and
one of the team leaders.”
Severn added.

Saylor tends to attribute his
improvement to the change in
coaching personnel on the team
this vear.

Looking To 49ers

Rob Benton and Rusty Win-
chester led the Wildcat
wrestling team to a victory over
Furman University last Satur-
day by a score of 36-12. David-
son was defeated in the other
two matches with VMI and The
Citadel in the other two mat-
ches in the Quad Meet at
Charleston. S. C. by scores of 29-
12 and 26-12, respectively.

After two forfeits put David-
son down 12-0, Rob Benton pin-
ned his Furman opponent in
only 1:52 of the first period.
Rusty Winchester won next
with a convincing 11-2 victory,
and then Jim Knights won his
first match of the year with a 3-1
victory.

John Kennelly continued the
streak, in which Davidson did
not lose one match in which
they wrestled with a_ third
period pin. Randy Webster and
Bernard Holloway both won
convincingly to finish the match.
Charley Dorsey and Bill
Garrett both received forfeits.

Rob Benton extended his

record to 7-0 with wins against |

VMI and The Citadel, with the
win over VMI a second period
pin. Rusty Winchester also won
three matches on Saturday and
got a pin over The Citadel 142

pounder.

Coach Charles Parker was
pleased with Saturday's per-
formance, saving that “if we
had Scandling and Jacobs we
might have beaten’ The
Citadel.”

The wrestlers’ next meet is
next Friday against UNCC in
Charlotte, and then the season
ends the following week with
the Southern Conference Cham-
pionships.
