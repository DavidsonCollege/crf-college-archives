FIVE YEARS OF INTERCOLLE-
GIATE DEBATING.

Easter Monday closed the fifth year
of Davidson's inter-collegiate debating,
with the winning of the cup from Wake
Forest. The record for these years has
been a good one, especially when the fact
is considered that Davidson has only a
collegiate department while institutions
with which she has contended have other
schools connected with them, and are
larger institutions as well. The record
is as follows:

Five debates with Wake Forest—
three won by Davidson; two won by
Wake Forest.

Two debates. with Wofford—both
won by Davidson.

Three debates: ;with the University of
South Carolina—one won by Davidson;
two won by U. S.C.

Total—six debates won and four lost

he debaters in these contests were as
follows (numerals indicate the number
of debates participated in): S. A, Lin-
ley, 09 (1); . McLeod, ‘09, (1);
D. yah, ' 10, (1); Ruffner, Camp-
bell, ’ to, (1); M.S. Huse, | 11, (2);
