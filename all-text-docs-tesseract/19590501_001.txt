Housing Fee Rise

The Fraternity Housing Fee
for the school year 1959-1960
has been raised to $23.00 per
semester. Freshman fraternity
pledges will pay one-half this
amount for their first semester.

“A $420,000 investment savas
made in the Patterson. Fra-
ternity Court from the College

, Endowment Fund,” said R. A.
Currie, College Business Man-

ager. “In order for the college
to realize the same 44-5 per-
cent net carnings from this in-
vestment .as it does for others,
‘the rent must be sufficient to
provide for, depreciution, main-
tenance, and other expenses.”

Out of a tofal cost of $491,-
000. the Patterson gift paid
$50.000. Monthly utility billings

‘are recovering the $21.000 gas,

water, and electrical service
charges. The college is then be-
ing paid back its $420,000 in-
vestment, with interest, over a
number of years.

“This figure of $23.00 should
stand for some length of time
if present conditions continue,”
Currie concluded.

in a five day orientation period
before his ten-week, trip begins.

The orientation period in
New York will involve meet-

sail from Montreal, Quebec,
arriving in Genoa, Italy on
June 28 or 29, and thence to
Russia through Czechoslova-
kia, staying five days in
Czechoslovakia and reaching
the Crimea on July 8.

Traveling under the auspices
of the “Travel Bureau of the
Commission on Youth Organi-
zations of the USSR,” this group
will havo its headquarters at
an international student camp
with Russian students of the
Crimea. Tours will be conduct-
ed through the schools, in-
dustries, and agricultural sys-
tems common to Russia.

“Each student,” commented
