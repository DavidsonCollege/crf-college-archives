CA Eats Print As KA’s Romp By Delts

By CAPTAIN AMERICA
And
NO BUCKY

Since last week’s column I
have spent much of my time
devouring heaping portions of
newsprint. The stuff really
doesn’t taste too bad with ket-
chup and salt.

The reason for this giant case
of the munchies is that my han-
dpicked team, the Delts, were
massacred by the KA’s 51-6.
For the information of the
freshmen, this is comparable to
Miami being beat 51-6 by the
Chicago Bears.

The KA’s, led by John Bran-

don, were superb as they collec-
ted 10 interceptions on their
way to crushing last year’s
champs.
Delt star Bill (McAdoo)
Mcllwain said, ‘‘We were un-
doubtedly the most overated
flickerball team on campus,
but we will get our s--t together
in the future!’’ Once again our
apologies to the KA’s, as this
proves even C. A. can be wrong
now and then, usually then.

While I’m eating newsprint, I
wish to inform the readers that
Dave Wolter, not Walter
Crouch, led the undefeated Can-
non I flickerball team. It’s been
a long week for C.A.

The ATO’s continue to show
fine form as they forfeited
another one, this time the free
gift was given to Richardson II.

Ace Kloditch, an ATO
spokesman, said that the ATO’s
were giving up all fall and win-
ter sports and going to South
America for the winter to get
ready for next year’s softball
season. J can’t see where it’ll
help them much though.

In other action last Wed-
nesday, the Cleveland Indians
buried Richardson III 40-20. Ob-
viously the tribe does not take
after their namesakes. Also,
the Altoona Aardvarks got back
on the winning track with a
resounding 32-13 thumping of
hapless SAE 2. pine

Thursday, the Phi Gamms
destroyed the pitiful Wimpettes
Plus 41-0. If the Wimpettes Plus
get any worse they’ll have to be

re-named the Wimpettes
Minus. It must be something in
the dorm.

In a biggie on Monday power-
ful Emanon defeated the North
Main Gozinyas 34-20 in a hard
fought game. The Gozinyas had
a lot of class but were  out-
manned by the underated
Emanon squad. The Gozinyas
were holding their own however
until they ran out of beer at the
beginning of the third quarter.

The tennis bums rebounded
from their opening loss to
defeat S-IV 19-13. The bums
have some good talent and fine
organization, and they may bea
dark horse by tournament time.

Powerful SAE 1 crushed
Richardson III 61-6 showing
form that could lead them to
the top. (How does it feel to
have C. A.’s Kiss of Death
SAE?)

The last game on Monday was
a 51-12 wipeout with the Staten
Island Fairies coming out on
top of Cannon-IV.

The Fairies were led by Joe
Duncan's seven touchdowns,

Club Gridders Defeated 26-0
By Top-Ranked ECU Squad

By JORDAN CLARK
Staff Writer

The Davidson club football
team lost its third game in as
many outings to a talented East
Carolina University squad by a
score of 26-0.

The final margin easily over-
shadows an outstanding effort
by the Cats.

Paced by halfback Bob
Bishop and quarterback Jimmy
Boyd, Davidson gained 350
yards as compared to the Pir-
ates 180.

Bishop garnered 101 yards on
23 carries as he charged
through gaps created by a
bruising offensive line.
Reichelderfer, Bob Wetzel,
Garner, and Zack Varnadoe
consistently ruled the scrim-
mage line.

Boyd kept the Pirates honest
as he completed eight of 15
passes for 150 yards.

“It was definitely our ‘best
game,"’ commented tri-captain

Wetzel. ‘‘We had more yards on
the ground and through the air,
but our mistakes killed us.”’

ECU, rated the best club
team in the state, intercepted
four passes and turned three of
them into touchdowns.

Another captain, Rollie
White, agreed with Wetzel,
saying ‘‘We played really well.
Considering the game was
played at 10 a.m. after Friday
night, we put in a super effort.

“The offensive line did a
great job, and on defense we
held them,’’ he continued.
‘Aiken and Long both made in-
terceptions, and McShain.
Reeves and Yeoman did all that
could be asked of them. Bill
Bradford should be noted for
his second consecutive suc-
cessful onsides kick.”

The game was a costly one for
the Cats as Rollie White and
Will Dunn were both injured
and have been lost indefinitely.

Still, the clubbers are op-

Sailors Fall At Citadel

By TRACY CHARLES
Staff Writer

When The Citadel hosts a
regatta and claims all three
trophies, it seems fairly obvious
that conditions indigenous to
.the area have played an ex-
tensive part in the victory.

High tides and swift currents

i last weekend in

Charleston placed each of the

six teams in a compromised
position.

The Citadel and the College of
Charleston placed first and
second, demonstrating ex-
cellent tactics in the strong
tides.

Daryl and crew Mike
Mayer sailed as Davidson's A-

surprising versatility in adap-
ting lake tactics to ocean tac-
tics. Subsequently, he tied for
second place in his division.
Frank Somerville and crew
Tracy Charles were Davidson's
B-team. A series of problems
with currents and tides placed
Sommerville in fifth place.

Davidson placed fourth in the
overall final scoring.

This coming weekend Jim
Stephenson and Dave Francis
will represent Davidson at
University of Tennessee. Crews
are yet to be selected.

‘We expect to win most of the
remaining games,’’ said Wet-
zel, ‘‘The tough ones are over.”

The next game will be Sun-
day at .Western Piedmont. On
Oct. 27, Davidson will play
Virginia Commonwealth
University in Richmond, a
game to be televised throughout
the state of Virginia.

A bizarre story

while Cannon-IV’s only spot
was Dick (the Human Truck)
Myrick’s successful running
down of two fairies.

Tuesday’s game had the
Pika’s struggling to stay alive,
just nipping S-IV 13-12. S-IV is
improving daily.

The SPE’s collected their

first win over SAE-2.

The KA’s took a while but
finally got control to take a 27-0
victory over Miles Glorious.

The MG’s spokesman Pete
“the Mole’’ Calentano says that
the MG’s will shut out the Delts
in their next meeting. I refuse to
comment.
