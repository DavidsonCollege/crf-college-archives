Meet Kilroy Bumgardner: man of five thousand hubcaps

By AURIE HALL
Special to The Davidsonian
Every time I’d drive up 115

toward Barium Springs or to
Elliot’s Ice Cream in Statesville
(best homemade around) or to
the Goodwill in Troutman, I’d
wonder about the hubcap
house.

I remember the first time I
saw the house, some time
during my freshman year.
there were silver hubcaps hung
all the way up the two-story
house. Hubcaps were stacked
on the front porch and flowed
down the steps and into the
front yard.

Turning around in my seat, I
watched the house go by and
wondered who lived there and
where in the world all those
hubcaps had come from, not to
mention why they had been
nailed on the house. Recently, I

combination grocery /hard-
ware/antique/and stutt-in-gen-
eral store. We looked over
wooden butter drums and Jap-
anese swords, pottery liquor
jugs and 80-year-old mechanical
apple peelers. There was a
machine made during World
War II where you dropped a
penny into a gun and tried to
shoot it into Hitler’s mouth.
After I shook the machine a
little to encourage it, a gumball
rolled out. I think it had been in
there since World War II.
Kilroy said that most of his
things are antique. He used to
sell the antiques, but it became

‘difficult to replace them. Now

he keeps them on display,
stacked on shelves and behind
counters. Besides the antiques,
Kilroy keeps a general store. He
sells Pampers and bubble gum

mers. Kilroy showed us a
copperhead, kept in a jar of
alcohol, that he’d killed a couple
of days ago. A large dog lay on
stacks of newspaper under the
counter. Mrs. Bumgardner said
that she used to try and make
Kilroy move things so that she
could clean up, but she’d given
up long ago. ‘‘You get used to
things after awhile,’’ she said.
We turned around to inspect
the hubcaps. One room in the
store is used as a storage room
for hubcaps, which are stacked,
according to type, in the room,
along with an oxen yoke, old
wagon wheels, and dutch ovens.
Kilroy figures he has over 5000
hubcaps on his place. The oldest
hubcap is from the wheel of a
1911 Ford fire truck. The hub-
cap is only about four inches
wide because tires were solid

inflated the tire became, the
larger the hubcap.

Kilroy started collecting
them when he was working at a
service station down the. road.
A-work crew had dug a trench in
the road to fix a pipe under-
neath. When they finished, the
crew left a hump across the
road. Cars bouncing over it
would often leave a hubcap
behind. Kilroy picked up the
hubcaps and, after awhile, if
nobody claimed them, he’d sell
them.

Soon people were bringing
him hubcaps from everywhere,
all the way from Florida to
Canada. Some he’s bought for
as little as 25 cents. ‘‘People
said, ‘take it to Kilroy, he’ll buy
anything.’ ’’Now junkyards
bring him hubcaps by the
truckload. ‘‘Some people say

think what they like.”

Finally, we walked over to see
the house itself. Kilroy esti-
mated that the house is any-
where from 125 to 150 years old.
“I guess most of the county: has
lived in this house at one time or

priother 1’ be said. Kilroy began
nailing his hubcaps on his house
so he could display his collec-
tion to potential customers.
That way ‘a customer can walk
around the house and see what
Kilroy has to offer.

We saw original Nash, De
Soto and Packard hubcaps. An
old Packard hearse and a Ford
convertible sit in the side yard.
They are also used for storing
hubcaps, but Kilroy claims if
someone will fix’em up, they’ll
run. Kilroy has never lived in
the house himself but occa-
sionally sleeps there on a nice
night.

decided that I couldn’t graduate
happy until I knew, and I went
to ask Kilroy Bumgardner
about his hubcap house. I found
out it was Kilroy’s house by
calling the Mooresville Tribune.
They said he went by Kilroy but
that wasn’t his real riame. No °
one was sure what his real name
was, so I asked Kilroy. He said
it is Roy Bumgardner but he’d
been given the nickname Kilroy
during World War II and it had
stuck. It must have, since his
service station, although it’s a
Texaco station, is listed in the
phone book as ‘‘Kilroy’s Service
Station.”

Photographer Sally Neal and
I met Kilroy in the store behind
the service station and next
door to the hubcap house. For a
while we poked around Kilroy’s

and canned goods and ham-

hubcaps — Kilroy Bumgardner’s got it all.

I’m crazy, but I just let’em

When asked if he wasn’t
afraid that someone would steal
his hubcaps, Kilroy said no one
comes near the house because
it’s supposed to be haunted.

Evidently, someone in the
past built coffins in the house
and the spirits still haunt it.
Once Kilroy offered a boy $100
to spend the night in the house,
but he refused. When asked if
he believed the house was
haunted, Kilroy just grinned.
To get to Kilroy’s house you go
up 115 past the bowling alley
and Pizza Hut and go straight
for two of three miles. The
house is on the left. You can’t
miss it. You can get a fresh
mountain apple, a little educa-

.tion, and a good deal on used
hubcaps.

Summer job hunting requires a sense of adventure

By ANNE GOODWIN
Assistant Features Editor

If you are a student. not lucky enough
to already have a summer job, you
probably are casting about for some-
thing to do. Of course, there is always
the local McDonald’s, but wouldn’t you

really rather do something more inspir-
ing?

Summer jobs can be harder to find
than full-time employment because
many businesses are reluctant to train
people for temporary positions. Never-
theless, Experiential Programs Director
Ken Wood maintains that jobs are
“infinitely available to people who have
some hunch” of what they want to do.

Some jobs can be extremely profita-
ble, but finding them requires a degree of
planning, investment, and adventure.
Wood mentioned work in Alaska fish
canneries and off-shore oil rigs in the
Gulf of Mexico as two lucrative possibili-
ties which can yield between $4, 000 and
$5,000 in a single summer.

If you like to work outdoors, another
possibility might be harvesting hay or
wheat. A phone call or letter to the
Chamber of Commerce of a rural town is
the best way’to make a connection. Ask
for the names of people who do the
harvesting and contact them.

Another possibility Wood mentioned
is the ‘‘dozens and dozens’”’ of camps and
dude ranches around the country which
hire college students. Some of these send
recruiters to, Davidson annually.

Or how about working in Washington,
D.C.? Wood said there are ‘‘many, many

jobs available in Washington.” While
federal budget cutting will‘ force some
agencies to cut back on summer hiring,

other agencies will have to employ fewer

full-time professionals, replacing them
with part-time positions and giving
college students more opportunities for
semi-professional work. Wood suggested

that students read about an agency in -

order to get a good idea of what it does
before applying for a job, and then visit
it in Washington as soon as possible to
apply.

Also in Washington,’ D.C., American
University sponsors internships for stu-
dents with backgrounds in the humani-
ties or government. In the past, interns
have worked in numerous positions
including the Smithsonian Institution,
the American Film Institute, and the
Japanese Embassy press office. If you
are interested in this program, contact
The Davidsonian.

If you want to get out of the country,
try Europe. Have you ever thought
about picking raspberries in Scotland?
Wood mentioned several employment
agencies which help place students in
jobs and get them work permits, but,
with the exception of one English
agency, they usually find mundane jobs.
Some of the agencies require that you
already be overseas before applying.

If you are gifted with the ability to
entertain people, you might even con-
sider working on a cruise ship.

Wood encouraged students to make an
appointment to talk to him, saying it is
“always appropriate for a student to

come in with an outlandish idea”’ of what
he wants to do. He added that experi-
ential summer jobs are valuable in an
undergraduate’s transition to work or

- graduate school.

Wood has a number of directories of

jobs available, including the 1981 Sum-

mer Employment Directory in the
United States, 1981 Overseas Summer
Jobs Directory, and Summer Jobs in
Britain. In adition, he has a listing of
internships, some of which pay well,

some not at all, and of research centers
and projects receiving federal funds.

Wood also has a list of alumni who
might be able to give Davidson students
a job. Other sources of information
about summer jobs include the an-
nouncement sheet and the posters on the
walls of Chambers.

If these ideas seem impossible, don’t
laugh. Davidson people have done some
wacky things in the past with a good
deal of success. Good luck!
