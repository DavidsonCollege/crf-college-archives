Century old bell times campus life

No one can escape time, at least no
one at Davidson.- Even those carefree
souls who have tossed their watches
to the winds cannot rid themselves
completely of a scheduled existence.

Some, of course, try. They smash
alarm clocks; they skip classes; they
come alive after midnight, fall asleep
during class; they-walk to class with
lowered eyes to avoid looking at the
big clock on Chambers.

Such rituals are futile. No one can
escape the bell of Chambers. One can
cover his ears just before the great
bell sounds, but he would have to
know the time of day in order to know
when to prepare himself.

A schedule is inevitable; the bell is
inevitable. Even worse...it’s mechan-
ical. It is our ‘‘Belle Dame Sans
Mercy.”

The bell is set. and watched by Mr.
Cashion of the physical plant depart-
ment, yet the system itself is mechan-
ical. The bell is controlled by a master
clock located behind the: telephone
office.

Each minute the clock sends an
impulse to a central timer holding
sixty pins, one of which is tripped
with each impulse. The pins are set so

that when the fiftieth and sixtieth
pins drop, the bell and buzzers are
triggered.

There is emergency bell, or
rather, an emergency system. At the

constant ringing of the buzzer, every-
one in the building should evacuate.
It is questionable whether the stu-
dents would be escaping the danger
itself or the unending drone of the
buzzer. Either motive would send
anyone running.

The bell that we hear each day is
not the original bell. While the school
was an agricultural school, the stu-
dents were called in from the fields by
a bronze hand bell.

This }18-year-old hand-wrought
bell had originally been attached to a
wooden rocker mechanism and pulled

by a string. Some time after its use at *

Davidson, Arthur Edward Armour
found the bell in a pile of burned
brush on his farm located on what is

now the northern side of the campus.

Dr. James Gudger, a Davidson
alumnus who inherited the original
bell, reminisces. Though it was first
used to call family members to meals,
it served other purposes as well.

Each June when the bees swarmed,
the bell was sounded causing the
queen bee to settle. The swarm would
consequently settle around her to
make the hive. The family used it also
as an emergency bell.

When a cotton bail stored under the
family’s log barn caught fire, the
mother rang the bell to summon the
neighbors. The barn did not burn.
The 5’2’’ woman managed to roll the
burning bail out of the barn by
herself.

The bell has subsequently passed
through four generations of the
Gudger family. It has been given to
the college by the descendants of
Louisa Susan Amour Gudger and can
be seen in the Davidsoniana Room.

The first true bell was burned along
with Chambers in the 1921 fire. All
that remains of it are the clapper and

be:
a few burned fragments. A new bell
was given to the school by an
alumnus and former mayor of Char-
lotte, F. Brevard McDowell.

Using the bell as a target for
pranking is just as much of a tradition
at Davidson as the bell itself. Only a
few weeks ago students found a way
to silence the bell. The situation was
soon remedied when the professors
began to lengthen their lectures by an
extra ten minutes.

When asked about various pranks
concerning the bell, Dr. Davidson
replied, ‘‘There must have been
something worth remembering, but I
don’t remember if there was. I was
too busy studying.’’ The bell has been
the target for pranking in every
generation, even to the extent of
destroying the bell completely. The
original hand bell was probably lost in
a similar prank. '

Less drastic pranks include -the
giant yellow '75 painted on the bell’s
face by last year’s graduating class.
Mr. Cashion, the bell’s curator, did
not sound overly concerned about the

pranking. ‘‘I guess they (the stu-
dents) just need to get rid of some
energy,” he commented wryly.

The Davidson community regards
the bell with feelings ranging any-
where from hatred to apathy to
nostalgia. It sounds different at 6:50
on. Monday morning than it does on a
pleasant autumn afternoon walk.

Its sound is unique in Perkins
Auditorium where its ring is pro-
ceeded by the forboding swell of the
machine which controls it. The bell is
a tradition.at Davidson.

It sounds like a shady campus,
pull-over sweaters, books under the
arms, and sodas. It sounds like a
“prep”’ school. It sounds like a
summer camp. It sounds like David-
son. :

The bell agrees with its envir-
onment, and no one is ever more than
jokingly opposed to it. It is a blessing
to those souls without watches that
wish to know the time. Some measure
out their lives in coffee spoons; we
just listen for the bell. After all, we
are in school.
