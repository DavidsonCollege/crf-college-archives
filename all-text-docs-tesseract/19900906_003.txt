Student Spends Dcmmer Near T Troubled Area: 7

; Dean Rusk Program Holds

Forum on Foreign Policy

By MIKA NABESHIMA

Held on August 27 in the Caro-
lina Inn, the first Dean Rusk Pro-
gram Foreign Policy Forum was a
great success. Participants included
Economics professor Dennis Ap-
pleyard, Spanish professor Lois

- Kemp, Political Science professor

Louis Ortmayer, College Relations
director Bill Giduz and aboutthirty
students. Ambassador Jack Perry,
Director of the Dean Rusk Pro-
gram, expressed his hope that this
forum will become a regular op-
portunity to discuss current for-
eign policy issues.

The dialogue was dominated
by discussion of the current Middle
East crisis. Students capecascd

their concern. about the danger
inherentin increased military pres-
ence in the area, the effect of a
long-term military involvement of
the United States, and the relation-
ship between Americans and Ar-
abs.

Other topics discussed in-
cluded the possible loss of lives
(American, Arab and other), the
rise in vil prices and the possible
resulting energy crisis, conserva-
tion and the future of American
policy in the Middle East. Rami
El-Amine, a junior international
student from Lebanon, recom-
mended a revision of U.S. policy.
He suggested that it be not only
centered around Israel but also

encompassing the Arab world.

The forum plans to meet once
a month. The next program on
September 25 will be a panel dis-
cussion on Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict. Participants on the panel will
include Molly Graver, who spent
last semester in Israel, and Wal-
lace Sanders, who interned at the
Palestinian Red Cresent Society in
Egypt and the West Bank this past
summer.

"It's Difficult to Imagine Until You See For Yourself"

By LISA GERRARD

Life is tough in the occupied
territories of Israel’s West Bank
and Gaza Strip, says Wallace Sand-
ers, a sophomore’ who: recently
visited the region.

Palestinian children play in the
dirt streets behind billows of tear
gas. Their favorite game is throw-
ing rocks at Israeli soldiers.

Prisons are overcrowded.
Health care is substandard. And
the threat of deportation looms ever
near.

The American public hears
little of what goes on behind the
wire fences of Palestinian camps,
Since Israel banned the press from
the aes territories in etd

inti Salter a pa “ighis
agency in Jerusalem. His seven-
day tour revealed volatile. neigh-
borhoods where abuse and anger
live side by side.

“We visited one home and were
gased twice over a period of four
hours,” he said. “It seems the Is-
raeli soldiers will throw tear gas
for no reason--it’s almost as if it’s
part of their military training to fire
on the people’s homes.”

The tour of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip was a side-trip Sanders
took in August after completing a
two-month internship sponsored
by Washington’s National Coun-

cil on U.S.-Arab Relations.
His duties were to help out in
any way he could ata hospital

for Palestinian refugees in, Cairo.

* &
On his first day, Sanders was

‘surprised to learn that his boss was

Yassir Arafat’s younger brother,

Fathi Arafat. Fathi is director of

the hospital and president -of the
Palestine Red Crescent Society--
an affiliate of the International
Committee of the Red Cross.

Atthe hospital Sanders worked
on a video for the hospital and
taught English. His students were
twoparaplegic men from Gaza who
had broken the 9 p.m. curfew and
were ae by ane eigee

ity ola bullets called idum-
dums.’ The term ‘plastic’ or ‘rub-
ber’ bullet is really a euphemism.
Some rubbér bullets are simply
steel ball bearings with a thin rub-
ber coat,” Sanders said.

“Under 50 yards, all of these
bullets are.as lethal as live ammo-
-especially when used against chil-
dren or fired like grapeshot from a
grenade launcher,” he said.

Israel has occupied the West
Bank and Gaza Strip since 1967.
The 1.8 million Palestinians who

have chosen to remain there live in:

squalid conditions.
“Although I'd been talking to

Palestinians for five weeks, Ididn’t
realize until then just how much
day-to-day. life. is disrupted. and
made unbearable,” said: Sanders.
“It’s difficult to imagine until you
see for yourself.”

Sanders saw families of eight
or more sharing a single dorm-size
room. He saw bathrooms that were
nothing but holes in the ground. He
saw that to be “well-off” in the
camps means having carpets and
sofas and being able to eat well.

Close to 12,000. ordinances

dictate the lives of the Palestini- .

ans: from frustrating to ridiculous,
the rules require them to stay in
their homes every night after 9
p.m. ene fergie Permission toplant

“The ‘intifada’ is a desperate
appeal on the global stage for the
world to stop talking about peasce
and start acting,”-said Sanders. -

' “Unfortunately, events in the
Gulf will probably eclipse this issue
rather than giving it the attention it
deserves,” he said. "As time passes,
more and more Palestinians lose
faith in a diplomatic solution--and
it’s difficult to tell a people to wait
when they face escalating death
tolls and encroachment on their
land.”

To preserve the West Bank
and Gaza Strip and protect settlers
who have moved there, Israel dips
from the $2.4 billion in military aid
that the U.S. governmentallocates
them

old boy who had been caught
throwing rocks at Israel soldiers.

‘i The: boy: said. that a°soldier ‘ap-
- proached him.afterward and asked

which arm he had used to throw the
rocks.

When the boy told him the left
arm, the soldier broke it.

One day Sanders was walking
down a street ina Palestinian camp
when a tear gas canister exploded
on the next block.

He ran to investigate. The
smoke had engulfed the room of
one small house where Sanders
could see a woman and her ten
children.

A child on the street picked up
the canister and showed it to the

American. It read: “TEAR GAS _

Oneof he barbs laws is that
they must have an identity card to
work outside the territories. And
authorities take cards away at the
slightest provocation, Sanders said.

“Students realized the futility
of going to school when they saw
their fathers who were doctors or
engineers sweeping hospital floors
and carrying bricks in Israel,” he
said.

The United States supports
Israel in its Palestinian policy. The
strong-arm tactics are part of Is-
rael’s measures combat the “‘inti-
fada,” or uprising of the Palestin-
ian Liberation Organization.

Sanders sympathizes with Is-
raeli interests, but his trip made
‘him wonder at the justice of Ameri-

“can aid.

“The U.S. government reacts
with moral indignation when our
national interests are crossed, but
often turns a blind eye to the ac-
tions of our allies,” he said.

He remembers several occa-
sions of seemingly indiscriminate
use of tear gas in the territories,
and he cannot forget the stories of
his Palestinian friends who spoke
of abuse in the camps and in pris-
ons.

Sanders talked to one ten-year

TYPE CS515-MADE IN THE
USA.”

“How can your country do this
to us?” the mother asked. Sanders
could not form a response.

Butnow he has found his voice:
“I want people to know what’s
going on in the territories,” he said.

“Complacency on human
rights issues can be considered
complicity in human rights viola-
tions,” said Sanders.

“Americans should hold our
leaders accountable for their for-
eign policy, then wecan more justly
hold other world leaders account-
able for their actions.”
