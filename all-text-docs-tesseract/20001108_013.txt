some people. Rbeieate goingto

be some nights on the court when itooks like
we’re runnin’ around with our heads cut off.
. Davidson rolled to a convincing 89-74
victory in a pre-season exhibition against the
Asheville Rage on Saturday—but frue to
their coach’s expectations, the squad com-
bined flashes of brilliance with spasms of
inconsis-

a tency.

“AN in
all, we made
some great
connections
on Satur-
day,” said senior © Kind Taylor. “But, as will
always be the case this early in the season, we
found some things we still need to work on.”

For a squad concerned with point produc-
tion, Saturday was a promising exhibition.
Junior guard Janna Magette was scorching
from the three-point arc, burying eight of 11
three-point attempts on her way to a team-
high 26 points. And senior center Kim Tay-
lor carried the scoring load inside—explod-
ing for 18 points while snaring a team-high
ten rebounds in just 21 minutes.

“Janna and Kim really stepped up,” said
Ashley Hallsted. “We have the kind of team
where different people can step up each
‘|night—and those two hit some really big
shots on Saturday.” _ :

The highly-touted freshman class accrued
their first'29 points, 14-assists’ and ‘33 re-
bounds in a combined 85 minutes of court
time.

“We're going to maed our tegen to
contribute this year,” said Taylor. “They
really stepped up on Saturday.”
_ Ashley Hallsted proved impressive—tal-
lying a game-high ten assists while grabbing
eight boards from the point position.

Kelly Copland, RobynFlewelling and Leah
Uhernik each saw about 15 minutes at the up-
for-grabs small forward position—during
which Copland snared eight rebounds,
Flewelling scored five points and Uhernik
dished out five assists.

Eleven Wildcats scored on the day, but the
squad also had eight players record three or
more fouls. And the ‘Cats suffered a major
lapse toward the end of the game—scoring
just 16 points on 6-32 shooting over the final
14 minutes of play.

“There were some big up’s and down’s,”
said Schott. “We’ll have a long week of
practice ahead, and I look forward to seeing
how we come out next Saturday.”

A new breed of Wildcats

Six freshmen join the squad

"By MIKE ANDERSON
Editor Emeritus

Hope springs eternal in pre-season gymna-
siums round the nation. Here at Davidson,
there is an extra sense of rebirth this season as
the women’s basketball squad breaks in six
promising freshman talents—hailing from as
nearby as North Mecklenburg High School

and as far away as the west-coast town of San-

Mateo, Calif.
Not since 1995-96 (Jamie & Kerry Brown

. and Jess Montrella constituted one of the top

twenty recruiting classes in D-I basketball ),
will the team look for such significant contri-
butions from its freshman class.

“Losing three starters to graduation from
last year and one to an injury during the
preseason really hurts us,” said Filar. “So
we’ll need a lot of poise from our freshmen
class to be successful this season.”

But, promises Filar, they’re more than up
for the challenge.

Ashley Hallsted

A 5-6 freshman from San Mateo, Calif.,
Hallsted isn’t just Filar’s point guard of the
future...she’s the point guard of today.

Hallsted,
who has al-
ready earned
the starting
nod, brings
tremendous
leadership and
ball-distribu-
tion skills to
the floor.

“She’s an
amazing kid,”
said captain
Bethany
Schott.
“She’s very

intense and
she loves the _
game. I’ve never seen her get nervous or
frustrated—she’s exactly what we need.”

Hallsted will also be looked to to anchor the
squad defensively. “We’re going to take our
defensive intensity to a whole new level,” she
pledged. ““We’re going to take it personally
when someone scores on us.”

“Ashley Hallsted is an amazing steal for
us,” said Filar. “She’s already surpassed even
what we thought she could bring to this pro-
gram.”

Courtney Laird

Another likely starter, 6-2 Courtney Laird
also hails from Sacred Heart Prep in Califor-
nia.

A high-
school

(0) f
Hallsted’s,

comes
from the
same hard-
nosed de-
fensive
brand of
basketball.

“Courtney
brings a
strong defensive presence to the inside game,”
said Filar. “She’s such an intense player.”
In addition, Laird has an inside-out game
reminiscent of Class of ’99 alum Jess
Montrella’s. “She has the ability to take her
game to the perimeter,” said Filar. “She’s

going to be able to extend some defenses out
on the floor.”

She also has the added benefit of playing
high-school ball with her college point guard.
“Tt’s so much fun to play with her again,” said
Laird. “We work well together, and it’s just
great to have a good buddy to talk about
anything with.”

Robyn Flewelling

A 5-10 forward from Okemos, Mich.,
Flewelling will contend for significant min-
utes at the crowded, though injury-ridden,
“three” position this year.

A tremendously well-rounded ball player,
Flewelling is a strong spot-up shooter and can
create opportunities to score off the dribble.

“When we recruited her, we even looked at
her as a potential point guard,” said Filar.
“But she’s got such an ability to score—so
she’s going to see some key time for us at the
two or the three.”

“Flew” played for some highly-successful
high school AAU squads—one of which
claimed 5" place nationally during her junior
summer.

Lindsay Shade

One of the most intensely passionate and
committed players on the squad, 5-5 Lindsay
Shade will comprise a major portion of the
heart of this year’s team.

She has also demonstrated an exceptional
outside-shot and will see time at the point.

“Lindsay brings a tremendous amount of
enthusiasm to the floor,” said Filar.

Janna Magette hopes the Hallsted/Shade
combination will engulf opposing defenses.
“Ashley and Lindsay bring such different
things to the table. Ashley is a penetrator, and
Lindsay is a finesse passer and a great three-
point shooter. I think they’re going to con-
fuse a lot of our opponents.”

Meghan Bryant

A local product from nearby North
Mecklenburg High School, Bryant enters as
one of the most athletic post players the squad
has ever known.
_ At 6-3, Bryant will likely split time be-
tween.the forward and center position and is
expected to
grow into the
“five” of the
future for
Davidson.

“She’s one
of the most
raw talents
that we’ve
ever had at
the inside po-
sition,” said
Filar. “She’s
6-3 but she
can run the
court as well as a forward. And she has
fantastic hands.”

Coaches further praise Bryant’s potency

‘on the boards. “She has a unique knack for

going to the ball rather than letting the ball
come to her,” said Filar. “She goes and takes
other peoples’ rebounds.”

Erin Delk

Thoughnotrecruited, 5-10 Erin Delk earned
a roster spot in pre-season work-outs.

The team’s only left-hander, Delk has
shown immediate growth and promise.

“It’s nice to have-someone who is left-
handed out on the floor,” said Filar. “And
she’s showing a really nice touch on the three
right now.”
