College to retain laundry services

Senate questions

By STEPHEN BELL
Senior News Editor

At the SGA Senate meeting
Tuesday night, Senator Carol
Watkins presented the final
plans for a school-wide poll on
laundry and security issues.

In studying an_investi-
gation of the laundry under-
taken in the Senate two years
ago, Watkins discovered that
some promised policy changes
were not going to be put into
effect.

Parking fee refunds

All Davidson students who received $10 parking fines
last term may obtain $5 refunded from their fines by filing
' a claim in the SGA office between 9 am Monday,
December 15, and 5 pm Friday, December 19.
Even those students who have yet to pay their $10 fines
should file a claim for a refund at the SGA office.

“It turns out they aren’t
going to phase out the
laundry,’ said Watkins, “‘des-
pite what Currie (College
Business Manager Robert
Currie) told us two years ago.”’

SGA President John Munce
is supporting Watkins in her
effort to poll student opinion
on the laundry. Munce said,
“We're going to pick up on
this, trying to get the student
point-of-view and trying to
resolve this once and for all.”’

The poll will also deal with

Covington accepts editor's
position without competition

By MARK DEATON
Editor-in-Chief

Matthew Covington will of-
ficially take over the editor-
ship of The Davidsonian in
January. He is unopposed in
the current campus-wide elect-
ion.

Covington has been on the
staff of the campus paper for
two years, serving as assistant
managing editor, assistant
news editor, and news editor.
He is now executive editor of
the publication.

Covington plans several
changes in The Davidsonian
but particularly hopes to or-

. ganize the production of the

paper.

“T am in the enviable posi-
tion of having a brand new
staff. Because no one has been
with the paper long, we hope-
fully have no bad _habits..
What we lack in experience is
surely made up in exuberance.
We are going to be-just fine,”
said Covington.

“* have already increased
the size of the production
staff, which means that we
will have more people in the
print shop each week to lay the
paper out. There will be a
sharp deliniation of what each
person is to do, and even more
importantly, when he is to do
it,’’ continued Covington.

According to Covington,
the increase in staff size will
itself lead to organization.

“We are going to have to be
pretty sharp about what we
are doing because otherwise
there is a chance that we
would be falling all over
ourselves,’’ said Covington.

Another goal for the new
staff of The Davidsonian will
be to take the paper to the
Davidson: student body. Cov-
ington feels that some stu-
dents who would like to work
with the paper do not because
they. don’t know that the
paper is open to them.

““Because we have meetings

unkept promises

some security issues. ‘In this
we are trying to find out what
our exact feelings are on this
and what we are willing to give
up to get better security,’’
explained Munce.

In other business at the
meeting Tuesday night,
Munce reported that Director
of Athletics Thomas Cartmill
would like to see a committee
of students work to foster
better communication between
students’ and the Athletic
Department.

The Senate had no objec-
tion, and an athletic grievance
committee is now being organ-
ized.

At the Senate meeting on
the previous Thursday (Dec-
ember 4), Andrew Lamas re-
ported that the faculty’s Edu-
cational Policy Committee had
accepted the SGA Senate’s
recommendation on ‘Incom-
plete’ grade policy.

According to Lamas, one of
the student representatives on
the EPC, the deadline for
submission of final grades to
change ‘‘Incomplete’’ will not
be changed after all.

Also at the meeting of
December -4, Marc Menchel
reported on the procedures he
has worked out for refunds on
old $10 parking tickets.

and people who work for us
regularly have titled positions,
a lot of students think The
Davidsonian is a _ closed
group,” .said Covington.

“The Davidson student is
an opinionated beast. The
Davidsonian has always
wanted to be a forum for
Davidson opinion. I hope any-
one will feel free to write or
simply to come by the office
and talk about what is on his
mind. We are anything but a
closed organization,” conti-
nued Covington.

Evaluating the paper tech-
nically, Covington feels confi-
dent that The Davidsonian
can be improved.

“Because we changed prin-
ters this year and because we
have our own type-setting
machines, The Davidsonian
looks very good. I believe that
my special contribution will be
improving what the‘ paper
prints. By organizing strict
deadlines for copy and setting
up a reliable paste-up sche-
dule, The Davidsonian will be
able to improve itself im-
mensely in the areas of
writing, campus coverage, and
typographical error,’’ said
Covington.

“We should also have a
better time producing the
paper if responsibilities are set
because the paper we put out
-will be first rate and we will be
functioning efficiently,’’ Cov-
ington added.

“For too long the David-

sonian has been some sort of a
thing that had to be wrestled
to the ground and hog-tied
each week. I believe we will
straighten this out and make
the paper better by accepting
more responsible control over
it,’’ Covington concluded.

building improvements. Most

of these building improve-
ments are incidental! yet im-

portant things that give flavor
to the building and make it
liveable,’”’ said Smith.

Smith and Physical Plant
Director Grover C. Meetze Jr.

will meet with College Presi-

dent Samuel R. Spencer Jr.
before Christmas to discuss
obtaining college funding.

Smith expressed optimism
about chances for obtaining
college moneys.

“We realize that money is
tight, but I don’t believe the
college fathers are going to let
us dangle,”’ said Smith.

A student photographic
darkroom, office rooms for
Quips and Cranks, The Mis-
cellany, and other student
publications, and a multi
purpose recreational room
have not been constructed due
to lack of funds.

Smith hopes to install a
specially-designed sound sys-

tem and permanent lighting in
the 900 Room.

Directional signs, a central
directory of rooms and a
calender display showing loca-
tion and date of events oc-
curing months in the future
are planned for Union Lobby
areas.

Tables, lamps, tac boards,
magazine racks and colorful
banners will be added to
selected Union rooms when
budget allows, according to
Smith.

“With these improvements,

_ Students will want to spend

more time here. We hope to
have more things for a person
to do on his own, watch T.V.,
talk and lounge comfortably,
read magazines, activities that
aren’t programmed,”’ said
Smith.

“We also hope to be able to
have community meetings and
programs at the College
Union. The ‘community is
welcome here,” he said.
