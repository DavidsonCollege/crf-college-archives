Ho, Ho, Ho!

Tis the season... for mail order!

By LISA GERRARD

Remember hours spent poring over the
Sears catalogue at Christmas time, picking
out toys like nobody’ s business.... Remem-
ber the letters so confidently penned; an
opening like “Dear Santa, I’ve been very
good this year,” would work pretty well,
maybe something stronger if your list was
really long.

Even now that we are all grown up (ha)
and spend more time finding gifts for oth-
ers than for ourselves, we college students
are still enamored with wish books. Repre-
sentatives of the $148 billion mail order
industry say that students compose one of
the fastest growing segments of their clien-
tele. We are part of a new “catalogue gen-
eration.” , -

For many ~
Davidson _ students,
mail order is the way
to shop. With final
exams immediately
preceding the holi-
days, it is likely that
more Davidson stu-
dents than ever will
be shopping by mail.
Mail order is easier
than driving into
Charlotte or rushing
to buy gifts in the few

days at home before
the 25th, they say. .

In aprocess that’s simpler than writing to
Santa, students pick out items they want
and with credit cards in hand, dial compa-
nies toll-free to place orders'that arrive in a
matter of' weeks. ‘Wish books have never
looked better. Sophomore Liz Yarema
said, “I'll probably do all: my Christmas
shopping by mail. I just don’thave the time
to go look for things.”

Ann Henry, a marketing analyst at J.

” 7 < ‘f
itis BRO

‘ Crew of New York City, said that college

students nationwide are discovering the
convenience of mail order. J. Crew’s recent
market research showed that a substantial
portion of their customers are students.
“It’s a relatively new phenomenon to get
them in such numbers. We’ ve only become
aware of it in the last two or three months,
and we’re still exploring it.”

Mail order companies sell a “look” that
students say they can’t find in the stores.
Sophomores Tina McKenzie and Amanda
Bastian explained it with examples from
their favorite catalogue, J. Crew. “All the
models look about our age and they’re
doing things you’ ve always wanted to do,
like making snow balls or wearing a skirt in
the snow. It just looks
like a group of friends
having fun. They look
very active, very casual.
It’s healthy, outdoorsy,
wholesome.”

J. Crew admits
that their catalogue is
very image-oriented.
“It’s a look that wasn’t
out there before,” said
Henry. “We’ve zipped
up the very conserva-
tive, very basic look.”
The result is what McK-
enzie and her friends
call “that simple ele-
gance” -- classic and sophisticated, but
young. “I would love to look like J.Crew,”
one student said, but, picking out a $52 belt
she liked, quickly added, “I don’t think I
could afford to look like J. Crew.” How
much students order usually depends on
who pays the bills.

One Davidson student whose parents
pick up the tab said she orders an average of
$1,000 a year in clothing. Another said her

next order would include a $300 pair of
boots. Somehow the prices don’t seem as
high to students when they can “put it.on
the plastic” and know Mom and Dad will
take care of it.

According to several students, mothers
are a prime reason
for the, emerging
catalogue genera-
tion on college
campuses. “My
mom’s been order-
ing from cata-
logues for as long
as I can remem-
ber,” senior Karin
Douglas said. Jun-
ior Heather Wright
said she grew up
with “tons” of
catalogues around
her house. “I'll go
home and my mom
and I will look through the catalogues to-
gether and I’1l show her what I like. A lot of
times that’s what I’ll get for Christmas.”

Men at Davidson have found unique
advantages in mail order, too. For students
like senior John Young, whose dad told
him, “Never let a woman pick out your

clothes,” ordering from a catalogue-can be © ~

the perfect way to bypass shopping sprees

with mom. Mail order works particularly
well for those who dislike shopping alto-
gether.

Sophomore Clay Adams, who mail-or-
ders about a fourth of his clothes, said he
likes using catalogues because he hates
“that browsing stuff.”
Freshman Lee Canipe
hates shopping too, so
when he needs something
he tells his mom, who
pulls out catalogues and
makes suggestions. “Most
of my nice clothes come
from mail order,” he said.

In order to make the
most of student interest,
this month J. Crew is buy-
ing student mailing lists
and launching a campaign
aimed specifically at col- ..
lege students. Spiegle of
Chicago is targetting the
student market with a youthful line of mer-
chandise in a brand new catalogue called
“Vibes,” and is participating in a“Glamour
Magazine” fashion show currently touring
five different colleges.
