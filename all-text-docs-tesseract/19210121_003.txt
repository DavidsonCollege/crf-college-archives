Y. M. C. A. BOARD OF
CONTROL PLANS TO
SECURE GOOD MOVIES

The movie show on Saturday night
has become so important in the campus
life of the students at Davidson, that it
would be greatly missed if discontinued.
Some good pictures were shown in the
fall and the management promises even
better ones this spring. All the pictures
signed for are new 1921 release. The
list includes some super-specials and it
is planned to have a two-reel comedy
with these.

The cost of these new pictures is of
course more than that of the old worn
out ones. To meet this extra expense it
was thought best to charge the students
Io cents admission. When the big pic-
tures are shown the admission will be a
little more.

Another added feature is the new
method of making announcements.
Slides have been purchased and by
means of these the announcements will
be thrown on the screen. Also the car-
penters are working on new benches to
accommodate the crowds.

MANY STUDENTS MAKE USE
OF Y. M. C. A. SOCIAL CENTER

The Y. M. C. A. has re opened the
social center as its first step in the new
year’s work. And it’s some social center,
too! The first rooms on the right as you
enter the “Y” building is now equipped
as a combination reading and recreation
center,

Not only home-like furnishings and big
easy chairs are to be found there, but a
player-piano and a vitrola as well as
games and magazines. A carrom board
has been ordered to supplement the
games already at hand.

Beside the exchange publications, four
periodicals will appear on the social cen-
ter tables, the Saturday Evening Post,
Colliers Weekly, Judge, and the Ameri-
can. Three of these magazines come out
weekly, so there'll always be a new story
awaiting the men at the “Y.”

Pennants decorate the walls of the
toom, and brightly colored hangings
drape the front window, while a blos-
soming narcissus on the center table
adds the finishing touch to its attractive-
ness.

Already the students are taking ad-
vantage of the pleasures offered by the
“Y” center, and it is hoped all will use
it frequently.

THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 21, 1921.

large equilateral triangle was placed be-
fore the society and as each Endeavorer
took part he or she hung a small white
triangle on the large one. When all of
the small triangles had been placed, the
motto of the meeting, “Be ye temperate
in all things,” was spelled out by the
triangles.

The committee leadership of this
meeting was the first of a series of meet-
ings to be led every second Sunday by
the various committees of the society.

PLANS TAKING SHAPE
FOR STATE
VOLUNTEER CONFERENCE

More Than 150 Delegates Expected
to Assemble at Trinity on Feb. 25.

Plans are taking shape for the Stu-
dent Volunteer Convention at Trinity
College, February 25-27 which promises
to make it the best ever held in this
state. There will be a hundred and. fifty
delegates, boys and girls, from ‘all over
the state. The boys will room in the col-
lege dormitories, but the girls will be
entertained in the homes of the towns-
people. All the delegates will take their
meals together in the college dining hall,
either before or after the regular college
meal hours. The management's idea is
that each delegation will assemble itself
at its own private table and partake of
its nourishment in a very sedate and
dignified manner, but—O boy!

Rev. S. M. Erickson, one of our fore-
most missionaries to Japan will make
one of the addresses. Plans are also un-
der way to have one meeting at which
foreign students studying in this country
will make appeals for their own lands.
There will be no regular convention ses-
sion Sunday morning, but the delegates
will attend the church services in town,
at which missionaries of that denomina-
tion will probably speak.

A convention handbook, something
similar to the one used last year is be-
ing prepared and will be presented to
each delegate. Everything possible is
being done for the comfort of the dele-
gates. Expenses will probably be only
about ten dollars.

BIBLE CLASS TO BE TAUGHT
BY POPULAR PROFESSOR

Beginning with next Sunday, Dr.
Fraser Hood will teach the Men's Bible
Class at the Sunday School. This class
was fairly well attended during the fall
and, under the excellent leadership of
Dr. Hood, it should be very popular this
spring. Foogball men will remember
that Dr. Hood conducted the regular
Church service the Sunday before col-
lege opened in the fall, so his ability
along this line is unquestioned. Sunday
School meets every Sunday afternoon at
3°30. All the men are expected.

STUDENTS URGED TO
SHOW MORE INTEREST
IN BIBLE CLASSES

Let’s have everybody out for the mis-
sion study classes next Sunday! The
meetings start at 10 o'clock, and last for
half an hour. The subject for the next
lesson is “What Manner of Man Is
This?” It is a study of comparative re-
ligions. Be up and ready when that 10
o’clock bell rings. Don't make the leader
on your floor rout you out of bed.

The showing for last Sunday was very
poor.

Half the floors had practically no class

at all. These are the statistics for‘ last

lowing report:

Brawley, no report.

Caldwell, no report.

LAST MONTH’S NEWS.
(Little items of interest which hap-

pened in December, but were too late for
the last issue of The Davidsonian.)

The Literary Societies had their an-
nual debate. The Eus represented by
Miller, Bitzer, and Mitchell were over-
whelmed by the brainwork and mouth-
work of the three Phi men, Roberts and
the Long. brothers, and had to taste de-
feat. The Orator’s medals were cap-
tured by C. G. Long and P. D. Miller.

* Dr. H. P. Verner, well-known explorer
and discoverer gave an extremely in-
teresting account of his work to the stu-
dents. He told of narrow escapes from
baboons and of hair-raising experiences
with the wild animals of Africa. Dr.
Verner has made many notable dis-
coveries in the botanical world.

Two of the class of ‘24 tried to dis-
play their Nimrodic prowess but were
rather unsuccessful and being unable to
find any game, they cut off their nose to
spite their face by shooting themselves
in the feet. Jack Hunter and M. H. Sut-
ton both had firearms to accidentially go
off in their possession and wound their
lower extremities.

The congregation at the Presbyterian
Church were especially fortunate in hav-
ing the opportunity of hearing Paul
Kanamori, the noted Japanese evan-
gelist. He told of the work that he has
been doing and of the great ambition of
his life, to personally, either through the
spoken or written word, present the
cause of Christ to every one of the
sixty million of Japan.

The Volunteer Band was busy in its
deputation work. Dave Roberts and Bit-
zer went to Gastonia and spoke in two
of the churches there, while Weeks and
Price spoke at the Second Presbyterian
Church in Mooresville.

_ On December 15th, under the leader-
ship of Major Hearn, two hundred and
seventy-five new I. D. R.’s were written.
It is understood that the War Depart-
ment will take the best of these and
compile new Drill Regulations from
them.
