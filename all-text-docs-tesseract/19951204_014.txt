Behind balanced, high-pow-
ered scoring and tenacious defense,
Davidson dominated Division III
Catholic University on Saturday
afternoon at Belk Arena, posting a
thorough 101-59 thrashing.

“Tl was delighted with our of-
fense,” head coach Bob McKillop
said. “I think the chemistry was
very good tonight.”

Five Wildcats scored in double
figures, as forward Narcisse Ewodo
led the way-with 17, along with 7
rebounds. Brandon Williams and
Quinn Harwood each registered
16, while Ray Minlend and David
Burns notched a dozen.

Mark McGuire (8 points, in-
cluding two dunks), Ben Ebong (a
solid 7 points and 7 boards), and
point guard Chris Alpert (2 points,
4 assists, 5 rebounds, and most
importantly, no turnovers) also
played well.

The women’s basket-
ball team has rolled to two
straight wins after dropping
their season opener 87-74 to
host St. Mary’s at the St.

Calif.

look sterling, but Chris had an out-
standing game tonight,” praised
McKillop, He made the players
on the court better by making very
simple passes. He was as respon-
sible for our points as the guy who
put it in the basket.”

The win upped Davidson’s
mark to a 3-0, their first such start
since 1992. Conversely, Catholic
dropped to 1-3.

After the Cardinals jumped
out to an early 4-0 lead, the Wild-
cats responded with authority es-
tablishing leads of 17-8 and 32-17
on their way to a 46-23 advantage
at intermission.

The second half proved no
friendlier for the overwhelmed
Catholic crew, as Davidson shot
54.3% from the field and tallied 55
points to eliminate the slightest
comeback possibility.

The scrappy and effective play
of guard Sammy Briggs (16 points
and 7 assists) was the lone bright
spot for Catholic.

Boasting aconsistent 30-point
lead throughout, a game-ending
19-4 Wildcats run produced the
final outcome, as an emphatic
Ebong dunk ended the game.

In addition to Saturday’s
game, the Wildcats traveled to

Oxford, MS, last Monday night
and topped Ole Miss of the SEC,
84-83 in overtime.

Unlike the win over Catholic,
the Wildcats constituted a two-
man show versus the Rebels, as
Williams (32 points) and Minlend
(27) combined for 70% of
Davidson’s total.

Williams performed best in
the clutch, registering eight of the
10 Wildcats points in the extra
period, including the game-win-
ner with 19 seconds left.

The victory was the first for
Davidson over an SEC foe since
they beat Mississippi State, 72-60,
during the 1965-66 campaign,
when a 21-7 (11-1 in the Southern

Conference) squad advanced to the.

NCAA East Regional semifinals,
eventually falling to Syracuse.

This fast start is promising, as
Davidson seems to possess the
ability to earn a postseason bid this
year. The Wildcats lastexperienced
March Madness in 1994 with an
NIT bid, while they traveled to the
NCAAs in 1986.

Wilmington, while N.C. State vis-

the road again overthe week-
end, traveling to the Pitts-

They lost in the first round
on Saturday, 75-55 to Rhode
Island.

“We have high expec-
tations for this season,” said
senior Kristen Ferrucci, who
presently leads the team in
scoring with over 17 points
per game. “We have some
really good new talent, and
some girls that should step it
up anotch. We haven't been
very successful in the last
couple years, but this season
we should start making noise

with wins and compete at
the top of the Southern Con-
ference.”

Kerry Brown, one of the
freshmen to whom Ferrucci
was referring, has already
made a huge impact, being
named to the all-tournament
team in California and lead-
ing the team in assists with
nearly eight per game. In the
two games in California, she
racked up 25 points, 20 re-
bounds, 15 assists, 2 blocks,
and 2 steals.

The other first-year
players are Jamie Brown,
who has been unable to play
this season due to injury;
Jessica Montrella, who has
been nursing an elbow in-
