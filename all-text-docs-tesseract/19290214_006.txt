Score of 46 to 17

In a slow and loosely played game, the
Oak Ridge basketball team beat the Da-
vidson Freshmen 46 to 17 last Friday
night at the Alumni gymnasium, The
Freshmen were off form and their play
was ragged. The Oak Ridge boys, on
on the other hand, played a steady game
throughout and were never forced to ex-
tend themselves.

Oak Ridge jumped into the lead ut the
very start of the game and were never
headed thereafter. They looped six points
before the Freshmen could score. The
half ended with the score 17 to 8 in favor
of the visitors. In the second half Oak

the final score to 46, meanwhile holding
the Freshmen to 17 points.

point man of the game, getting 22 points.
He looped ten field goals during the game.
His aim at the basket was uncanny,
hardly even missing the loop Royster,
center, also played a good game, getting
six field goals to cunt up 12 points.

For the Fresmen Milton at Center and
Mathis at guard played steady games.
They were the only men on the whole
team to get any field goals, Milton loop-
ing three and Mathis two.

ELKINS INJURED

In their match with Barium Springs
February 6, the freshman wrestling team
sustained the loss of Rosser Elkins, 125-
pounder from Waycross, Ga. Elkins was
in his second match of the evening when
his left arm was dislocated at the elbow.
It was thought at first that the bone was
broken, but examination at the college
infirmary showed that it was a disloca-
tion. The injury will keep him off of the
mat for about a month,

C. W. Harrison Talks
To Volunteer Group

The Volunteer Band met last Sunday
at one-thirty in the lower part of Shearer
Hall. John Preston led the devotionals.
Charlie Harrison gaye a most remark-
able talk on “The Preacher and Missions”
In his talk he told of personal experiences
in the orient, and gave his own reaction
to America’s view of modern missions.
His talk followed the book which the
Volunteer Band is studying, “The Desire
of All Nations.” The supreme responsi-
bility is on the ministers. They have to
give an account of what they do, they
must not lie down on the job. The
supreme element of the minister’s respon-
sibility is his message—it is a perpetual
office, and man’s deepest need. The su-
preme element of the minister’s message
is his conception of God; it is the all-de-
termining factor. God is not a class or
a race. The church is not going into
the world to preach the gospel as it was
commanded to . The gospel is for the
needy, Ministers must avoid the easy
way. Pastors have to face the great temp-
tation of building up their own work to
the detriment of the broader scope of
their Master’s work. Ministers must ex-
tol their charges to give to missions.
They must not shrink from this duty.
Missionary passion comes from knowing
God. Christians must be brothers to all
the souls of the earth,

Business was then taken up and it was
decided to havea feed tomorrow night.
Plans were discussed for conducting a
study class in the Presbyterian Church
in Cornelius,

The Volunteer Band has been sending
deputations to Statesville for the past
three weeks to speak to the Covenanters
League, a young people’s organization
there. The first week Glenn Frye and
Ben Drake went, the second Sunday,
Preston and McFayden. the third Sun-
Preston and McFadyen, the third Sun-
day McFadyen and Banks, and last Sun-
Band is looking forward to quite a few
deputations in the future, but at present
they have all that they can convenient-
ly handle. Under the able leadership
of John Preseon, the new president, the
Volunteer Band is doing a wonderful
work this semester.

FRESH MATMEN
LOSE TO BARIUM

Freshmen Lose to Barium Springs
in First Wrestling Match

The Freshmen Grappler of Davidson
lost their first wrestling bout of the sea-
son in a match with the Barium Springs
ageregation. In the six matches staged,
three were copped by Davidson men
and three by Barium Springs. Of the
three bouts won by Davidson, McKin-
ney’s and Conway’s were falls while
White won his bout on,a time decision.

The Fresh showed good form in all
their bouts and pushed the Barium
Springs men hard to win with the tight
score of 15 to 13. The 115 pound class
was intensively interesting to the on-
lookers in that Woodward of Barium
persisted in securing’ numerous holds on
Grady while Grady always managed to
break loose although he was _ finally
thrown after six minutes of fierce strug-
gling. McKinney and Conway both show-
ed good form and plenty of fight. Conway
won by a fall in five and a half minutes
and McKinney threw his man in about
the same time. White also came through
with a time dicision over Lee in one
minutes and eighteen seconds. Elkins
and Ashcraft lost by falls to Donaldson
and Jackson respectively. In two ex-
hibitions matches immediately after the
main bouts, Houston defeated Shaeffur
on a time decision and Elkins lost to
Cumbie, receiving in this match a disloca-
tion of his arm.

The prospects of the Fresh team as a
whole look good and predictions are that
they will have a good season. They
haye been working out with the Varsity
and there ought to be several good mat-
men for next year’s team.

W! S. HENDERSON
Davidson, N. C.

February 14, 1929

Cornell University—(CNA)—One of
the most mile-stones in the history of
Cornell College was passed on recently
when the joyous ringing of the Chapel
bell announced that a large field of faith-
ful workers had been victorious in their
untiring campaign to raise $1,600,000 for
Cornell College. The campaign head-
quarters at Waterloo stating that a total
of $1,600,037 had been subscribed to the
fund.

The rasing of this fund means that the
gift of $500,000 offered to Cornell by the
Rockefeller Board of the Rockefeller
Foundation would be validated and that
this sum would be turned over to the
local college authorities.

Purdue University (CNA)—The state
library and state historical bureau of In-
diana will occupy a fine building in the
future if the present state legislature
makes the necessary appropriation of
$1,000,000 to erect it. W. P. Dearing,
chairman of the Indiana library and his-
torical bureau, who recently announced
the proposed building, stated that the
bureau will ask the legislature to au-
thorize a special revenue to meet the
sum. He believes that a tax levy of
one cent: for two years would be suffi-
cient.

Yale University (CNC)—College pro-
fessors are lragely to blame for their
own low salaries, according to a report
by a committee of Yale professors made
public recently. An excess of teach-
ers is blamed.

“The proportion of teachers to students
in American universities is far higher
than in the universities of Europe,” the
report said. “Unless radical alteration
of the American university policy is put
into effect, a progressive deterioration
in the quality of university teaching and
scholarship is indicated as inevitable.”

(CNC)—The influx of college men to
the ranks of professional baseball teams
has gone far toward the elevation of the
national pastime, but colleges and ama-
teur athletic leaders have gone to an
even greater degree in taking baseball
out of the hands of poolroom gamblers
General Palmer E. Pierce, for twenty
years president of the National Collegi-
ate Athletic Association, declared in New
Orleans recently.

“Today the professional gambler has
less hold on the players. The pitchers
and the catcher on the amateur team
are really amateurs, and there are more
and better amateur players being de-
veloped, The American Legion boy's
baseball series, to which the co-operation
of the National Collegiate Athletic As-

sociation was given, is helping the. boys
and baseball. College sports are cleaner
than they have been, and because of the
influence held by college conferences and
associations, other athletics are in bet-
ter condition.” Clean play and clean busi-
ness. General Pierce believes, have a di-
rect relationship.

Kent State College—(CNC)—Dr. J.
O. Englemen, president of Kent State
Normal College, announced recently the
resignation of the business manager, J.
B. Gillespie, Jr.. who has occupied that
position in the college for nearly three
years.

This action grows out of a recommen-
dation of Dr. B. R. Buckingham, for-
merly of Ohio State University, who
conducted a survey of Kent State Nor-
mal College immediately prior to the be-
ginning of Dr. Englemen’s administra-
tion. One of his recommendations was
that the office of business manager at
Kent State College be abolished.

Yale University—(CNC)—The staff of
Yale University—from president down to
humblest janitor—is insured*under group
insurance plan involving $5,000,000. The
first’s month’s premium was paid in full
by the university, an announcement said
recently, but after January 19, part of
the premium must be paid by the individ-
ual or the policy will become void. The
university will continue to pay “a sub-
stantial portion” of the premium, the an-
nouncement said. It is believed\ to be
the largest group insurance of its type
negotiated in the state.
