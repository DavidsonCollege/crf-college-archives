1 CAMPUS LEAGUE.

The ladies ot the town have been dili-
gent and enthusiastic in their organiza-
tion of a Civic League tor the improve-
ment of the appearance of the streets and
sidewalks. “They have furnished .recep-
tacles tor trash “and papers, and have
been persistent in their requests that all
unite in-an effoct to keep the town clean.
Vhey are meeting with fair response,
whieh the men of the college could do
much to better. A Campus League that
would extend this work of the Civic
League to the college grounds is just as
much needed. We are so in the rut of
throwing aside envelopes, paper wrap-
pers, peanut bags and Peter's cholocate
papers wherever we happen to be when
we are through with them. that we sel-

dom realize how the edges of the walks
look to visitors. Better to cram our
pockets till we reach a waste basket than
to make a waste basket of the campur.
‘True, a certain) old) darkey makes a
faithful round of the grounds every day,
and gathers what scraps he can see on
the pointed end of a fifty-vear-old stick.
But to see our librarian have to stoop
often and pick up a piece of paper which
some student has carelessly thrown away
On the grass should at least shame every
man into doing his part to keep the cam-
pus attractive and beautiful.

COME ON. TIGERS!
—_— *

Next Saturday the mighty Clemson
“Tigers” will meet the Red and Black
Electric Machine on the Davidson grid-
iron. Two teams, ancient rivals, will
clash, and two eminent coaches, “Bob”
Fetzer and “Bob” Williams, will match
their foot ball wits.

The result of this. game's outcome
cannot be estimated. A victory for
Davidson wotld send the team forward
through the rest of the season with a
mighty impetus, and inspire confidence
in plavers and supporters.
come with a team picked from a student
body of over seyen hundred and a squad
of about eighty, and the Red and Black
will have to fight to win. But she will
fight, and the fight. will be fruitless un-
less the whole college as a body will
stand behind the fighting machine with
a determined and invincible enthusiasm
and spirit, that will send it down the
field and across the goal-line. Come on.
Tigers!

A REPORTERS’ STAFF.

Tre Daviwsontan staff has decided
to open the competition for places on the
staff to men of all the three lower
classes on the following basis: This
year, early in| November, a reporters’
staff will be chosen from ail those who
are now trying and will try out for the
paper. These reporter's names will be

printed just below those of the editorial '

staff. Next March, when the editor-in-
chief and manager are elected for the
following year, an editorial staff will be
chosen by the outgoing staff and new
editor from the reporters’ staff. In this
way, every man will be fully and well

staff, and. will feel if he is selected to the
position, that he has worked for it, and
that his honor is worth having. Already

competitive test. Now that it is open
to every class thar will be here next

place’ on the reporters’. staff in Novem-
ber. Hand in your name to the assist-
ant editor and you will be given assign-
ments.

CONTRIBUTED.

Somewhere a bard has sung: “The
old order changeth. vielding place to
new,” etc. and in reflecting on the old

order of things as they were a few years.

back here at Davidson, we recall that
feature of old.times that had to do with
the sale of athletic goods. In those days

there was no such thirtg as ‘The Com-'

missary:” athletic goods were handled
by individual agents scattered over the
campus—one in Chambers, another per-
haps in Georgia, or a third in Watts.
Nobody kept a half complete stock.
Students found it very refreshing and
exhilirating to run from first one build-
ing to the other in the atrempt (usually
vain attempt) to get anything bordering
on what they wanted in the athletic
line. hen. too. there was the feature
of profit, ‘The different agents pocketed
all that was profit—and in one or two
instances, through some oversight. pock-
eted some that was not profit. But that
is another story.

Then in the course of time (about
two vears ago), the Mother of Inven-
tion presided over a group of students
comprising the Executive Committee of
the Davidson College Athletic Associa-
tion, who conceived the idea of operating
all these agencies ‘under one manage-
ment. carrving a complete line of goods,
and furnishing to all reguiar teams their
equipment at cost, and turning a part of
the profit accruing fromssuch business
into the coffers of the Athletic Assocta-
tion.

‘Vhe present. Commissary is the result
af this scheme, and the result of the
Commissary is that last year the foot
hall and base ball teams were equipped
by the Association for what the goods
cost, and the Commissary turned over
nearly enough profit to pay far this
equipment, with the further result that
the Association was given a big hoost.
With the continued good management
of the teams, and with the continued
support of the student bodv. the man-
agers of the teams and of the Commis-
sary. should clear the Association of
debt, and put out teams that, in appear-
ance, mav be equalled. but not surpass-
ed, bv any with which they come in
contact.
