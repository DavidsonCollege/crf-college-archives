‘Stop Drug Enforcement’ SLC Says

By JOHN McLEAN
Associate Editor

Reports from the Student
Life Committee ‘SLC this
week indicate that the col-
lege may be on its way to-
ward nonenforcement of its
rules against drugs.

Sources close to the SLC
said Tuesday it has recom-
mended to college president
Samuel R: Spencer, Jr. that
the antidrug clause be drop-
ped from the Code of Re-
sponsibility, making way for
a “more lenient and_ con-
structive approach to drug
abuse correction.”

The report has not been
released yet, but sources
close to the committee (who
for personal reasons chose
not to be indentified) pro-
vided a resume of its con-
tents.:

The recommendation was
made, sources said, primari-
ly because of legal difficul-
ties of enforcement as ex-
perienced in last. year's
drug case.

The SLC reportedly felt
that relaxation of the col-
lege’s enforcement would al-
low it to develop a more ef-
fective counseling program
for drug users who want
such help.

‘The SLC report went on to
say that while the college
should not take punitive
steps against drug users or
sellers, it should not ‘‘act as
a sanctuary for drugs and
should still ‘seek to discour-
age the use of drugs. . . by
unspecified means,’’ sources
said.

At the heart of the com-
mittee’s concern was that
the college ‘could not act
both as law enforcer and
private counselor.

The report ,did not say
but strongly implied that the
college should call_on state
police to enforce state drug
laws if the campus _situat-
tion became intolerable in
the view of the administra-
tion.

Student. members of. the
Regulations Court. last year
sent, a strongly worded
statement to the SLC in
which they called for a halt
to college presecution of
drug cases.

The court members felt
that last year’s drug case
showed. up a lack of just
procedures and ‘‘sloppy’’
rules for evidence.

The SLC recommenda-
tions on drug enforcement
were part of an overall re-

port to the president on the
Code of ‘Responsibility, which
faces trustee review this
year.

Sources close to the com-
mittee said it had expressed
“confidence in the purpose
and philosophy of the Code,”
and hoped that it would be
enforced more aggressively
by counseling measurers
rather than ola means.

the college courts more like

For example, the court is
advised to adopt a detailed
manual of procedure in all
cases, spelling out the rights
of the accused in unambi-
gueus terms. The manual

Spencer could pass the re-

Of Fraternity Selection Changes

By GRAY WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor

President Samuel, R. Spen-
cer Jr, has publicly endorsed
changes in. the basis for affil-
iation with Davidson frater-
nities, a move which would
significantly alter the present

social system ih © Patterson

In his address to the col-
lege community Monday
morning, Spencer suggested
that the bidding system now
in practice be discarded in
favor of house memberships
based on random assignment,

self-selection, or other pos-
sible grouping arrangements.

Citing the polarization
which exists between frater-
nity men and independents
as well as the ‘decreasing
membership and _ internal
conflict in Patterson Court,
the President posed his
question,

“Given the current situa-
tion,” he asked, ‘‘do we as
a community have the ima-
gination, foresight, and_init-
iative to do more than sit
by and wait for total disin-
tegration?”

The proposed changes are
similiar to the findings of
the Student Life Committee
(SLC) in their report on So-
cial Patterns submitted last
year,

The SLC urged that the

situation be handled ‘‘by
transforming the _ present
fraternity system into a

system of eating clubs, non-
exclusive in nature, which
would serve as the basic
social units for students
after the freshman year.”

This committee would in-
troduce random assignment
into rising sophomore classes
beginning this spring which

» would completely erease the

image of the old houses by
the opening of the 1973-74
academic year. Implement-
ation might be facilitated by
linking assginments to the
arrangement of the fresh-
man dorms.

Schedules Cause Cafeteria Overload

By JEFF ALLENDER
Staff Writer
‘ Overcrowding has hit the
cafeteria.

Recently meal lines have
stretched _ outside the dining
room area. Sometimes stu-
dents have been forced to eat

g up while waiting
for’ space at tables to put
their trays, as these tables
fill ‘up at certain peak
“periods: aa

Breakfast and dinner

crowds are often heavy, ac-
cording to cafeteria manager
Klaus G. Kleeberg, but the
main problems occur at
lunch.

“Of course, the 25 more
freshmen we have this year
over last year and the in-
crease in independents has
something to do with it.”
commented Kleeberg. ‘But
the major problem is the
number of cafeteria users
who have classes at 12:00.’

At least two thirds of the
total group of meal-ticket
holders must go to class at
noon, he explained. This
leaves only the time from
12:50 until the cafeteria lines
close at 1:30 for these stu-

dents to eat, while the other:
(third of the students. have

from noon until
themselves.

The number of students
eating right-at_l-p.m._is,—ac-
cording to Kleeberg, due to

12:50 to

the fact that ‘‘most students
are hungry and eat as soon
as they can.”

Going to the union directly
from class is more conveni-
em for most, and thus the
concentration of cafeteria

users occurs from~12:50 -un-—

til around 1:10, and earlier,
but less overwhelmingly, at
noon.

Expanding the time that

“the: lines serve is not the

Taking into account the
discrepancies in the suggest-
ed methods for implementa-
tion, Spencer agreed in prin-
ciple with the SLC report.

His recommendations will

ow undergo discussion by
he faculty and the student
senate; recommendations will
be prepared -then for con-
sideration by the ,Board of
Trustees when it’ convenes

The traditional fraternity

The only nominal change
in the system was the recent
addition of ‘‘extended rush,”

which was an aibawaeh to in-
crease the numbers in the
houses and to mollify the
impact of rejection on fresh
men who failed to receive a
bid in rush.

Spencer, himself a former
fraternity member at David-
son, believes that students
today ‘‘do not feel the, kind
of loyalty and devotion that
was once characteristic of
fraternity men.”

He recognized the desirable
features of fraternity life,
including friendships form-
ed, service activities, and

. Small group social functions.

As he puts it: ‘To suggest
that something different
might be better does not im-
ply that fraternities are
‘evil.’”
