THE DAVIDSONIAN

BOBBY RIGGS AND TROUPE P

PLAY BEFORE PACKED HOUSE),

Segura, Kramer Cop Singles Matches;

Kramer and Parker Win Doubles

By JIM FARRAR

Wednesday night in Johnson gym, a packed house watehed
the five top tennis players in the world show their talent Bobby
Riggs brought along with him on his tour, Frankie Parker, Jack
Kramer, Pancho Gonzales and Pancho Segura. This exhibition
of tennis was perhaps the best any of us have seen or will ever

see. Even though some of the
players were not in their top play-
ing condition, the crowd was able
to grasp the greatness of thesc
men in their field.

In the first match of the eve-
ning, Segura played Riggs in what
was possibly the best match. Riggs
took the first game of the first
set, but Segura began to find the
spots on the court where Riggs
wasn’t and was placing his two-
handed shots with deadly accuracy.
Segura went on to win the set,
6-3. Riggs came back in the next
set to play Segura on even terms.
Towever, he dropped this set, and
the match, 11-9.

Segura won the match, 6-3 and
11-9. Segura captured the crowd
with his bowlegged walk, ready
smile, and smashing two-handed
shots. Riggs featured a beautiful
net game, winning most of his
games from this position.

In the second match, Jack
Kramer easily downed the youth-
ful Gonzales. This win for Kramer
made their match score, 69-20, in
favor of Kramer. The winner of
this series of matches is to receive
a $100,000 prize. This was perhaps.

Whit Cobb in Durham
Practicing For Game

By BILL WHITE
Whit Cobb, captain and outstand.
ing leader of Davidson’s Wildcat
basketballers this past.winter, is in
Raleigh this week-end where he
will appear as a member of the all-
senior Southern Conference all-tar

squad to oppose N. C, State’s loop)

champion Wolfpack tomorrow
night in Reynolds Coliseum.
Yesterday and today Whit

worked out with the all-star squad
under the direction of Duke’s Gerry
Gerard, coach. of the picked quint,
in the Blue Devils’ indoor stadium.
They play against the Pack tonior-
row night in a game designed by
State’s Everett Case to keep his
crew in trim for the coming East-
ern, NCAA tournament in: New
York in which the Wolves will
represent region three.

Possibly the finest defensive
guard in the Southern Conference
this winter, Cobb became the -first
member of the all-star five to be
announced. He and the other mem.
bers of the team will be guests of
State en route and returning, and
will be presented handsome watches
as members of the team, in keep-
ing with their amateur standings,
Case has pointed out.

The selection to the all-star squad
comes as but one more honor
heaped upon the slight shoulders of
the slim Durham senior, who has
made all-state and honorable men-
tion all-southern honors for the past
two years. Few doubt that had
Davidson produced a winning club
this winter, Whit would have been
granted an all-Southern berth.
Three final games of high point
making rocketed Whit’s scoring
total to a personal all-time high of
233 points in 26 games for an 89
average, the highest average in
final Big Five standings for a
guard.

Mooresville

the most disappointing match ot
the night. Gonzales was off in his
games, as was Kramer, Both men
featured a smashing serve that both
had trouble in returning. Kramer
took the first set, 6-2, and. the
second one, 6-1, Gonzales couldn't
hit the ball back for some reason.

At this point Bobby Riggs gave
away a ‘wrist watch and tennis
racquet to those persons holding
lucky numbers, The watch was
won by Joe McDonald of David.
son, and the racquet was won by
Tom Greer of ‘Spartanburg.

The next match was the doubles
engagement with Pancho Segura
and Pancho , Gonzales meeting
Frankie Parker and Jack Kramer.
Behind the smashing serves of
Kramer, and almost flawless floor
play ! of Parker, the two Panchos
soon found themselves ‘on the
small end of a 6-4 set. The second
set went to Kramer and Parker
by a 7-5 count. This match was
featured by beautiful net play by
Kramer, flawless floor play by
Parker, the bustling smiling Segura
and the serves ‘and irritation of
Gonzales.

The first annual Red and Black
game, concluding spring football
drills, was played on Richardson
Field last Saturday afternoon with
Jim Fasul’s Blacks overcoming
Auburn Lambeth’s Red team, 27-14
The some 1,000 fans present, saw
a close and occasionally dull first
half, and then saw plenty of action
the second half.

The Blacks, coached by Dick
Redding, had the power both of-
fensively and defensively, but gave
away the speed to the Reds. The
real “star” of the game was 185-
pound Ham Wade of the Blacks.
The powerful soph fullback bulled
his way for 114 yards on 16 tries
and punted four times for a 36-
yard average. Auburn Lambeth
of the Red team, which) was.
coached by Ray Brown, connected
for six of twelve passes and 101
yards to lead both teams in that
department,

All the Red’s first downs came
in the first period, when they
opened the scoring on a sustained
drive of 46 yards in eight plays.
Roy White went over from the 2,
Bowers converted, and the score

stood 7-0. The Blacks. came’ back,
recovering a Red fumble on the
Red 45 and going down the field
for a TD. Wade rambled for 25

ning from. the fullback slot in the
“T” formation, Ham proved beyond
a doubt that the Cats are set in this

and delayed bucks
through the middle ripped the Red
forward wall apart and set up a
couple of the Black’s four TD's,

back but played under the shadow
of C. L. Runyan until the Gastonia
plunger was injured. However,
Ham did put.in a lot of time as de-
fensive halfback.

Wade packs plenty of power in ,

his stocky frame. He tips the scales

at around 185 tbs. and gets off toj

an amazingly fast start. Once he
plows past the line, his power and
elusiveness make him a hard tar-
get for the defense. (The Red squad
will verify this).

Ham calls Charlotte home, al-| |

Chapel Hill. At Central High in
the Queen City, he was outstand-

sure to keep the name of Wade
alive at this school if his perform-

Optimistic As Baseball |f
Team Bats And Throws Into Shape|

By BILL ADAMS

Dragging their bats and balls out
of their winter hibernation, David-
son’s varsity baseball candidates
got down to serious work for a
tough spring schedule that fists
some twenty contests, while at the
same time school officials were
casting wary eyes on the new
Johnston gym windows and stray
foul balls.

Twenty boys have answered
Coach Charley Jamerson’s call so
far, with a few others expected to
turn out who haven't made an of-
ficial appearance as yet. .

Coach Jamerson is counting on
the best team he’s ever had here
at Davidson, but expects much
tougher competition than in pre-
vious years. If a few question
marks are answered, such as C. L.
Runyan's spring football hurt, and
Charlton Torrence’s sore arm, the
Presbyterians could pull some sur-
prises this year. The team appears
strong everywhere except in pitch.

PAGE FIVE

Here are two big reasons
why the Black squad won the
inter-squad game last Saturday
—Jerry Kiser and Jim Fasul.
These two huskies. both sopho-

yards, Jimmy Rogers for 2 and
then Wade went for 5, 3, and 4,
and a touchdown. Kiser’s extra
point made it 7-7, and the half
ended in that. score.
The Blacks opened strong in the
third and fourth periods, and
shoved across 3 more TD's. A Red
fumble on their own 21-yard line
paved the way .for the second
Black score as Johnny Guiton went
over from the 2. Talbert’s kick
was good, and the score read, 14-7.
Both teams scored in the last
period. The Blacks rushed to two
more tallies on smashes by Fresh-
man backs’ A. C. Gregg and Jack
Ruth. Gregg’s 38-yard punt return

mores, held down the guard
slots in the Black line and al.
most completely stymied the
Red offensive through the mid-
die. Kiser weighs 225 lbs. and

featuréd one drive,’ and a Ruth
quarterback snedk pave the Blacks
their final TD. Lee Talbert, Soph
end, added both extra points. The
second Red score came on a beau-
tifully executed 53-yard pass from
Lambeth to end Dave Williams, up
from the touch football league.

‘Coach Little, who watched the
game from the grandstand, com-
mented that the teams looked fairly
good, but downfield blocking was
a little weak. Maybe it’s a good
omen for the young ‘Cats (the aver-
age is 19) that the game was’ -so
successful. Every player but five
on the squad has at least two more
years of eligibility.

TENNIS MATCH MONDAY

Davidson's netters, seeking
to equal and better their pre~
vious year's impressive record,
open the tennis season Monday
against Ohio State. A new ad-
dition to the schedule, O. S. U.
looms a formidable fog from a
tough Big Ten and should be a
good test of the Wild®ats’ met-
tle. Following this home match,
Bo and company will go on a
tour of Florida teams during
the Spring Holidays. Go out
Monday to sec a good match

and to back the Cats.
