THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 3, 1924

DAVIDSON
FIVE YEARS AGO

Unusual interest has been shown on
the golf course during the past week.
The weather being excellent, afforded an
opportunity for the golfers to work on
the handicaps before the tournament.

Several of the players are expecting to
go to Charlotte soon to see the profes-
sionals, Jim Barnes, Mike Brady, Ed Fue,
and Carl Anderson, play. Carl Anderson
came to Davidson and explained a few of
the strokes to the club last year.

Dr. Arbuckle is going to have two of
the professionals up here to give the club
a few pointers and new strokes.

That long-hoped-for improvement is
about to be realized, viz: the reconstruc-
tion of the tennis courts. Those who
have seen the rolls of chicken wire may
have imagined that the college was go-
ing in for poultry farming, but the fact
is that the tennis courts are going to be

put in shape for stopping a few of the,
wild. shots instead of necessitating a‘

hundred yard dash after each serve. Al-
so posts have been erected on the courts
near the post office. So all the artists of
the raquet and sphere may take heart
and and anticipate an opportunity to in-
dulge in this pastime instead of waiting
two hours to play 15 minutes.

O. J. Thies, ’18, of Charlotte, was on the
hill one day last week.

Spann’s single in the ninth prevented
the Wildcats from having a hitless day.

Better look out for Currie and Clark.
They are exteremely wild at times.
Never mind, that is only temporary. They
are going to make a nifty pair of college
twirlers.

While “Dug” McArn was at the bat a
feminine voice in the grandstand was
heard to say, “Cut out the Hoola Hoola,
kid, and swat the pill.”

“Crabby” Cravath, judging from: his
flow of language when soaked in the ribs
by one of “Buck” Currie’s fast shoots,
has been rightly dubbed.

The Glee Club trip two weeks ago was |
such a success that it seems a shame to|
let talent of so excellent a quality go to|
waste. For this reason two engagements ,
have been made for next week; one of |
Monday at Mitchell College and the!
other at Lenoir College on Tuesday}
night. |

Spanish Plays Enjoyed by Crit
Audience

|

An unusual event of the past week was |

the rendering by the Spanish Club of a}

|
musical program and three,gne-act plays. |
The performance took place Tuesday}
night, March 25th.

The program consisted of, the Spanish
National Hymn, sung by the entire club ; |
A Child’s Story, told in Spanish by Miss |
Alice Jane Fleagle; La Golandrina, by a!
trio of stringed instruments; La Paloma, |
a solo sung by C. F. Monk; Borinquen,
by Watt McCain; La Bandera, Cancion |
de la Manana, La Terruca, by the club.

The three one-act plays were farces. |
The first one, Lacita de Amor was writ-|
ten by W. F. Galloway. It is a breakfast
table scene dealing with the difficulty
which arose over the wife’s insisting that
the husband tell how much he loved her}
before she would serve his breakfast.
Those taking part in it were: W. F. Gal-
laway, A. M. Martin, Wade Allison, and
A. F. Simpson.

The second play, El Espejo is a seven-
teenth century farce. The action centers
around a simple servant, who seeing his
mistress looking at herself in the glass
thinks that she is flirting with someone
out the window. Those taking part in
this play were: Austin, T. T. Jones, J.
B. Thompson, E, C. Douglas and Forrest
Franklin. ;

The third play was El Joven Medico In-
fortunato. Those taking part in it
were. A. T. Roe, Stewart, and Miss
Frances Johnston,

The concluding number of the program

was the singing of O Davidson in Span-

Playing on a soggy field, under threatening
clouds, the “Wildcat” diamond artists de-
feated the Oak Ridge preps in the second of
a two-game series on Richordson field, Satur-
day afternoon, winning 4 to 3. The contest,
a gruelling affair, see-sawed back and forth
for seven innings, at which time Red Me-
Pherson, pitching for Davidson, scored Bou-
shee with a long single to center, winning
his own game. :

Potts, who pitched the earlier innings for
Davidson, was relieved on the mound in the
fourth by McPherson, who held the Oak
Ridge team scoreless for the remaining six
innings. McPherson, pitching superbly, al-
lowed his opponents only three scattered hits
during the six innings that he hurled.

Davidson started the scoring in the first
inning, when Frank Alford banged out a
homer with Smith on base. Alford placed
his hit just between center and right fields,
and just out of reach of the opposing fielders.
Oak Ridge came back. in the second frame,
and tied the count. Wells got to first when
Potts threw him four bad ones, and Grimm
singled. Both runners advanced on a passed
ball, and then scored on McLean’s long
single,

A single by Tomko, followed with a triple
by Ross, gave the Ridgers a one-run margin
in the third. Davidson lagged behind until
the fifth, when two singles and a perfect
squeeze-play by Simpson brought across the
tally needed to tie the score. In the seventh,
McPherson sent a hard drive to left field,
scoring Boushee, and winning the game.

Ross, hurling for Oak Ridge, displayed an
ability seldom equalled by prep school pitch-
ers. He held the Davidson, batters to four
hits, these being fairly well scattered. Cap-
tain Boushee, in center field for the Wildcats,
made a number of fancy catches, and vied
with McPherson for first honors.

'BROTHER OF DECK BOYS
| HURT IN AUTO ACCIDENT

The Davidson student body was sorry
}to learn Friday of the serious injury of
| Verdell Deck, brother of the Deck
| brothérs here now. Word was received
|that he had been seriously injured and
iL, L. Deck and L. C. R. Deck left im-
| mediately thereafter for Atlanta. The
| former returned to Davidson Monda

and the latter will come back with in a
| short time.

| school was enroute to his school, when
la little girl suddenly came out:in front
| of the car and in order not to hit her he
swerved to the sidewalk. After the im-
pact with the fence the car turned over,
and as a result young Deck suffered a
fractured skull and other hurts. It was
at first thought that he would not re-
cover, but hopes are now entertained
for his return to health.
