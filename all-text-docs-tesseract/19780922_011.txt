As a Davidson student,
William Brown never attended
a single Artists’ series perfor-
mance, I just didn’t know about
it,” he lamented. .

As Assistant Director of the
College Union, Brown is really
concerned with getting srudents
and the community to attend
the four extravaganzas. ‘I want
to see the house filled,” Brown
declared.

charge. This year they will be
asked ‘to make a commitment
by paying two dollars for the
four tickets. This season tickets
approach will help Brown “get a
clear reading on the number of
students who plan to attend.”
The remaining tickets will be
sold through a community tic-
ket drive.

the four annual productions has
been fairly poor. Some shows
were sold out, but several drew
crowds of only three hundred.

also say that there were nine

“This sort of attendance isn’t
fair,” he continued. “It isn’t
fair to the performers; they're
too good. It isn’t fair to the
three hundred who attend; they
don’t get the total experience of
a packed house. And it isn’t fair
to the nine hundred people who

and I was elated when I heard
about our current line up. This
is a great opportunity to get
people excited.

The Artist Series for this year
includes an opera with a twenty
piece orchestra, a well known
actress presenting a program on
early American films, a nation-
ally reknown ballet company,
and a world famous pianist.
Specifically the acts are as

change this year. ‘The goal is

Annual regatiasets

freshmen spinning

By JOHN CHUNG
Staff Writer

Grimacing at his second to
last place vessel in the race, the
U.S.S. Maybe, freshman Keith
Hearle declared, “There are no
rules in this geme.”’ The game
was, of course, last week’s
annual Freshman Regatta at
the Davidson Lake Norman
campus.

However irreverent, the age-
old tradition received its de-
served respect. At precisely
2:30 pm Sunday, caravans left
the main campus for a fifteen
minute ride to the muddy
waters to observe and partake
in this moving event. The
Regatta, aside from the race,

‘includes cleverly selected games

designed to make freshmen look
like freshmen, but more impor-
tantly to have a good time.
This year, seventeen halls
were represented by all sorts of
home-made boats. Teams wa-
ded and carried their vessels

through muddy waters as their
fans trotted up and down the
shore cheering them to victory.

The Regatta soon gave way
to the climactic event “dizzie
lizzie’, a relay rece of sheer
balance for the participants and
certain laughter for the viewers.
Thie game captured the full
attention of all present as the
competitors ran like hopeless
drunkards back to their await-
ing teams ahd some into the
lake.

Uniquely, the team’s perfor-
mances never seemed to matter
from the beginning. All those
who attended subscribed to the
philosophy of having a good
time. The confusion and candid-
ness of the events replaced the
goal of victory. First Richard-
son’s boat Maybe (maybe not)
was christened with.a can of
beer, opposing crafts were sabo-
taged, and Will Terry and
David Grant were thrown-into
the lake.
