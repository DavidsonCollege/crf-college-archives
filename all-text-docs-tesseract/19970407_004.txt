SGA chartering: SGA rejects committee
recommendation, grants charter to IVCF

By NaresH NAGELLA

Whatadifference a year makes.
Last year after the Charters and By-
laws Committee voted to recom-
mend the SGA not grant InterVaristy
Christian Fellowship (IVCF) achar-
ter, the SGA agreed ona 16-15 vote
to deny IVCF the status of a char-

‘tered organization. ‘

This year, the same committee
upheld the previous recommenda-
tion, but the SGA decided to renew
the charter in a 22-9 vote.

“We saw a conflict between
the college’s non-discriminatory
policy and [IVCF’s overall inten-
tions,” says SGA representative and
committee member sophomore
Jonathan Sipling.

“IVCF said membership is
open to anyone but discriminates
requirements for their leaders. The
college policy does not differ be-
tween membership and leadership
whereas IVCF does.” The commit-
tee rejected [VCF’s proposal in a 4-
3 vote.

The discrimination at issue was
apart of the I VCF constitution man-
dating: “To be considered for lead-
ership in this organization individu-
als should demonstrate lives.....free
of patterns of gossip and slander;
drunkenness; sexual immorality,
including the practice of homosexu-
ality, or the inappropriate practice

of heterosexual activity outside of
the marriage context; selfish ambi-
tion; hatred; lewdness; and the like.”
(Article V, Section 1)

While the details in question
had not changed, the nature of the
debate surely had.

Last year’s discussion centered
around whether a homosexual stu-
dent could ever become a leader in
the organization and the ethics of
banning or permitting that.

This year it centered mainly
around whether or not IVCF met
the procedural guidelines for be-
coming a chartered organization.

“The issue here is what the
SGA can do in accordance with its

by-laws. Section 4f requires that an,

organization intends to abide by
laws. Except where an exception is
appropriate and allowed by law. It
is legal for the Presbyterian church
to say it does not want homosexual
ministers. They could not get in
trouble for discriminating in that
manner. The issue here is legality.
It is discrimination but it is legal,”
says Kappa Sigma senator Connor
Eldridge.

Some students still expressed
concern that a discriminatory orga-
nization would be able to apply and
get funds from the student body.
But, the granting of the charter does
not automatically give an organiza-
tion student money. They must ap-
ply for that separately.

The legality of the IVCF orga-
nization and its practices seemingly
were sufficient grounds for most
senators to support granting the
charter.

Independent senator Jon
Hutzley still agreed with the
committee’s recommendation
since, he says,“IVCF expressly
states they will discriminate against
acertain segment of the population.
Not granting the organization achar-
ter will not inhibit their freedom of
religion.”

Hutzley also noted that other
organizations do not have problems
fully complying with all aspects of
the school’s non discrimination
policy and that IVCF should not be
an exception.

“If the College Democrats
specified against a Republican be-
ing a leader in their organization, I
would not vote [for them to have a
charter] either,” he says.

Senior Zac Lacy still believes
IVCF should be granted a charter,
saying, “IVCF did the six things
required to get a charter. Later on
down the road if they do or do not
follow it ,then that is another issue.”

IVCF executive board mem-
ber Kellsey Sewell states, “The dis-
tinction [between membership and
leadership] was not intentional.
There is a legal standing for what
we have done. It is important for us
to be recognized by the College.”

Cannon speaks on the pebbles of ethics

Dr. Katie Cannon brought
womanist ethics to Davidson in
her lecture entitled “Pebble Eth-
ics” on Thursday.

In a world where black con-
notes male and female means
white, black women are left with-
out a paradigm.

“Black women’s experience
has been overlooked, neglected,
or distorted in most of the existing
ethical scholarship,” Cannon
writes in her book Katie’s Canon.

Cannon asserted that we must
reconsider age-old traditions and
doctrines of sexism and racism to
correct what she calls “academic
invisibility.” Black women have
been forced to “bleach and neuter
ourselves so that we can exist in
the Western cannon,” she says.

“There is an unspoken, infor-
mal code. within intellectual soci-
eties which African American
women must subscribe to or run
the risk of being misunderstood,
misinterpreted, or being second
class scholars specializing in Jim
Crow subject matter,” says Can-
non.

Cannon focuses on the “life
lessons” of African American
women.

“These are the “irreducible
contradictions of black experience
in America,” she says.

Cannon used the example of
Fannie Lou Hamer as the essence

of the first pebble in womanist
ethics.

In 1962, she stepped into a
courthouse to register to vote. The
sheriff beat her until she was un-
conscious. After that incident,
Hamer refused to relinquish her
fight for civil rights.

Alice Walker coined the
phrase Womanist in her book In
Search of Our Mother’s Gardens.
Walker names a womanist as “a
black feminist or feminist of color...
Usually referring to outrageous,
audacious, courageous, or willful
behavior. Katie Cannon combines
womanist with ethics to mean “ex-
periencing within and interpreting
without.”

ers.
