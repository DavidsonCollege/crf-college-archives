Professor Cites Historical
Perspective As Relevant

By RICK HART
Staff Writer

Speaking to a group of
about 50 students and pro-
fessors Wednesday, John R.
Snell, professor of history at
the University of North Caro-
lina at Chapel Hill, fielded
a number of questions con-
cerning the uses: and valid-
ity of history and opportun-
ities of history students.

Answering a query. about
criticism from other social
sciences that history is not
a relevant study, Snell said
that perhaps persons.in those
disciplines are a little too
confident that they have all
the answers,

He said that some social
scientists take a narrow view
of problems, confining their
study to the modern Ameri
can situation and not. taking
account of historical per
spectives.

Citing perspective as one
of the values. of the study
of history, Snell. said that
ideally history shows us “‘how
we got where we are today.”

It serves to free persons
from the limitations of their
own time and place, teach-
ing the critical evaluations
of situations. Thus, he said,
we are constantly finding
ourselves at junctures where
we have choices and create
choices for the future.

Campus Stream Spoiled

By RUSS MERRITT
Associate Editor

The college official was
very definite in his retort
to my question. ‘Pollution?

Why, you’re barking up the
wrong tree, son. We don’t
have any pollution here at
Davidson.”

His answer seemed to sum
up the attitude that many
Davidson officials have to-
wards the ecological concern
that has. been sweeping the
country and the world re-
cently. And yet, upon closer
observation, appears that
the college is as blind to its

own__transgressions—as—Con-
Edison in New York has
been in past years.

After receiving from col-

lege employes what appeared
to be a unanimous, opinion
that Davidson does not pol-
lute the streams and land
in the area, I decided to do

Snell admitted that there
were some subversions of the
historical profession, citing as
examples those who use his-
tory for political ends.

He spoke of the historians
who choose facts to prove
points and of thosewho hold
a “‘straight-line’ theory of
history, “that history is a
series of inevitabilities.

Illustrating these problems
from his experience in re-

Snell noted that East German
rhetoric often sounds as much
like biology as like history.

Replying to thé criticism

Snell held—that-—ne—absolute

this, he said, does not ex-

RHC, Administration

Spencer, Holds
Moral Objection

By JOHN McLEAN
Managing Editor

In a development related
to the 24-hour open dorms
proposal, President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. announced his
opposition to the 24-hour open
dorms proposal.

Spencer told this reporter
that “I just don’t approve
of the idea of girls staying
overnight in men’s dorms.”
He stressed that this is a
personal moral view and that
it is not a decisive consider
ation, ,

Spencer said that he views
the proposal as a_ basic
change in faculty and trustee
policy, and it will thus have
to be approved by — both
groups before going into ef
fect.

Spencer further explained
his view that ‘‘any education
al institution establishes a
climate in a lot of different
direas by the standards it sets

“The social, moral and
ethical climate are all part
of the educational climate.”

kaculty Committee Foils
Calendar Change Effort

By STEVE ROADY
Associate Editor

An attempt to have. the
proposed 1970-1971 academic
calendar changed failed Mon
day, as the Faculty Execu
tive Committee, after listen
ing to arguments from SGA
President Ran Coble and for
mer Calendar Advisory Com-
mittee member Stephen Roa-
dy, passed the following res
olution,

Resolved, that we retain the
1970-1971 calendar as adopt-
ed, and that we hold an open
meeting as soon as possible
to get opinions, so that prior
to the end of this academic

year we can adopt a calen-
dar for 1971-1972.

According to Coble the open
meeting to consider the cal
endar will be held next
Thursday, Mar. 12 in the
Morrison Room,

Coble and Roady’ had ar
xued that the proposal cal-
endar contained several ob
vious drawbacks, such as the
scheduling of fall term ex
ams immediately after the
Thanksgiving break, and the
resumption of winter term
classes after Christmas break
on January 11th, instead of
on January 4th,

It is interesting to note that
as I stood there on the bank
watching the bubbles float
down the stream, one of the

many area stray dogs, one
known among students as

“Mange.” walked down the
opposite bank for an appar-
ent drink.

However, upon sniffing the
stream, he promptly walked
back up the bank and wan-

Last Friday, the SLC voted
its approval of the measure,
but also adopted President
Samuel R. Spencer’s idea that
it was not competent to take
final action on the matter,
according to Dean of Stu-
dents Richard C. Burts Jr.

The SLC minutes record its
decision to recommend the
approval of the proposed
changes to the faculty.

The RHC Tuesday night de-

cided to challenge the SLC
referral to the faculty on
grounds that it is unconstitu-
tional, taking the challenge
to the Court of Appeals.
. As of press time it had
not been ‘decided by__the
court, the administration or

whether the Court of Ap-
peals could legally decide
such a case.

The RHC also voted to poll
the student body on its pre-
ference for having. 24-hour
open dorms. That poll will
decide which dorms will’ be
open around the clock if and

when the faculty votes its
approval.

RHC and the administration
