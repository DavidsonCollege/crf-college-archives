Into The Life-of Things

By J. S. BLAIN

Francis Quarels wrote:

“My soul, sit thou a patient looker on.

Judge not the play before the play is done.

Her plot hath many changes, every day

Spedks a new scene; the last act crowns the play.”

This bit of verse contains an exccllent answer to the
question whieh so inany have asked coneerning the world

and its present chaotie condition:
the world to become involved in war and suffering? Our |.

Why does God allow

span_of life represents so small a portion of time when
compared with the vast exteat of the file of the universe
that we are not capable of understanding or judging con-

ditions of this wartorn earth.

At Vespers on July ninth, Dr. John A. Redhead stated!
that we are challenged today to rise to supreme heights

of courage, sacrifice, and. faith in God.

graphic illustration of the oyster which takes a trouble-
some bit of sand in its shell and makes of it a valuable
pearl, Dr. Redhead pointed out that the troubles and wor-
ries which beset us all can be turned into “pearls” with

a litde effort on eur part:

Comparing the universe to Nazareth, and using John
1:35 46 as his text, Dr. Redhead said that the only an-
swer to those who doubt any of Christianity’s phases
-is,that given By Philip when Nathanacl asked, “Can
there any good thing come out of Nazareth?’ Phitip’s

answer was,

“Come and sce.”
Christians, must do today.
' Bleachers and get in the game.

Then the question of

why things should be as they are dissolves and the im-

portant thing becomes ‘Flow can we do something about

iw?”

Faith is perhaps the most intangible thing in life. -

is basic and essential in our religion, but few people

have been able to define it:

Evidences of faith are num-

erous in everyday living, but not often do we sce onc

whose life is ‘based on complete faith.

Dr. Redhead

defined true faith as ‘the total response of the total per-
sonality to a way of believing.’ Total response would
mean that in all thoughts, words, and actions we submit

ourselves to the will of God. This submission must in-.

volve all wkoughts, words, and deeds, for onty then clo
we embrace the total personality--"there is no compari-

son with Jesus Christ... The only answer to that quest- |,

ion which is so often asked today, and whieh is the ori-
gin of these thoughts. is faith - a stubbon and unyicld
ing belief that. even though every circumstance scems to
' deny God. Mis -will and.-purpose and power will ulti-

matcly triumph. “

That faith and peace which can comfort and strength.
en us for these difficult days can be Eound by continually
living close to God. The Reverend Clit tl. Met.eod, o1
Mooresvilie, who preached at Vespers on July sixteenth,
reminded the students that Jesus spent much time in
prayer and weditation in order to live the perfec? life,
and we must follow His example if we wish to lead hon

ored lives, crowned by heaven.

Mr. Mel.eod said that

only by believing in God can we tind hope, and he pointed
out that the hope of desire or probability is wrong: the
hope of expectation, that the good will win out, is the
hope which God meant that we should have. The sug-
gestion that each of us observe a period of quiet time
each day, for prayer and meditation, is one by which we} to make. the same speech about mo.
can all profit. “Mid all the traffic of the ways . . . make
in my heart a quiet place and come and dwell therein.” ~

Dr. John B. Gallant conducted Chapel on July 11, and
delivered a very thorough talk on the many different

versions of the Bible.

Pointing out many humorous

sidclights, he traced the development of the Bible as a
book, and urged the students to use some of their time
profitably by becoming acquainted with the various types
of books and other. printed material ayailable in the library.

Chapel on July 18 was led by Dr. Frontis W. Johnston,
who stressed the importance of remembering that each of

us has potential ability which may be used for the better-

point by pointing out that in

‘(the year 1809, when the at-

tention of the world was
rocused on the Napoleonic
Wars, almost to the exclus-
ion of all other news, there
were born several men who

in the second chapter of
Paul's second letter to Tim-

Abraham Lincoln, one of
those great men born in

applicable to all-of us: “I
