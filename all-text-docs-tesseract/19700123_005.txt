‘Cat Assistant Coac

By A. W. TURNER, JR.
Asst. Sports Editor

Just a glance at any Da-
vidson athletic team, will
show anyone that ROTC in-
structors do not only teach
military science. This year's
group of officers has kept
up the tradition of helping
coach Wildcat teams by be-
ing involved with football,
basketball, and baseball.

The college's most suc-
cessful footbalh season was
partly due to.the assistance
of (Maj. Harold E, Phillips.

Phillips worked along with
David Fagg with the de-
fense, He also Was responsi
ble for getting the ‘‘scrubs”’
to know and be, able to run
the coming opponent's  of-
fense against the ‘Cats’ de

His work here with ROTC
kept Phillips near Davidson
most of the time, but he did
go on three road trips to

The team is predomi-

Clemson has already opened
their season, suffering ‘a lop-
sided loss at the hands of a
strong Virginia team.

“We have-a chance to win,
but we'll have tovswim at
our best,’’ Stevens predicted.
“Clemson is out for a win,

Although a victory will nec-

Stevens is counting on sev-

Phillips played both base
ball and football in high
school at Selma, N. C.°On
the gridiron, he was a line-
backer and a center.

The newest addition to the
ROTC staff, Maj. Thomas
Dixon, is probably the best
athlete in the department.
An assistant with-the fresh-
man basketball team, Dixon
Was a cager for Tuskegee
Institute. for three years.

Dixon also has had some
high school coaching . ex
perience, serving first as an
assistant and then as head
coach for track and basket-
ball at Lexington, Ga.

Maj. Frederick Brigham
helped with Davidson's base
ball team last spring. "“My
main job was spring train
ing,’’ Brigham said, corm-
menting on the work. “I
coached more then since
head coach Tort, Stevens
was occupied with the swim
ing team. Then during the
season, I was the third base
coach."*

Brigham also mentioned
the problem of not being
able to go on road trips,
