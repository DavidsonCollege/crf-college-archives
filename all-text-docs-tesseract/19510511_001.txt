The Eberhardt I Knew...
“I Can See Shephelah Now”

(This is the first in a series of one article about the trip of Davidson’s own “Abdul” Eber
hardt to the Mid-East. The middle lump is Eber hardt.—Ed.)

By MIKE MYERS

A somewhat sunburned Charles B. Eberhardt closed the door at his paneled study and
gave the Davidsonian the first inside story of his recent journey to the Mid-ast. The pur-
pose of his 314, month trip, sponsored by the Ameriean School of Oriental Researeh, was to con-
duct archaelogical and geological research in the lands so often mentioned in his Bible lee-

tures—the Holv Lands.

Dick Boyd Stars
In French Drama

At a dinner meeting of the Cer-
cle Francais held at Chez Montet
in Charlotte Tuesday night the fol-
lowing officers were elected for the
next year: president, J. V. Hunter;
vice-president, R. M. Bulgin; secre-
tary, H. N. Cannon; treasurer, A.
V. Goldiere.

The French Club of Charlotte

had a good delegation to join the

‘local club for this special meeting.

The following cast presented the
one act play, “Cupidon, Dentiste:”
Le Dentiste: J. R. Boyd, Jacques
LeLefranc, W. H. Bell, Marguerite

Didier: R. R. Hart; Le Grew Men 5

sieur: R. M. Bulgin; La Vieille
Dame: W. W. Crymes; La Bonne:
W. B. Lord.

To accomplish this- Prof. Eber-
hardt was pretty much ‘on his
own. Leaving New York January
18, he flew overnight to Scotland,
spent seven days there and seven
more days in Engtand: Then on to
Geneva (where he visited the of-
fices of the World Council of
Churches) and Rome (where an
audience with the Pope was ar-
tanged.) While in Rome he visited
the catacombs and excavations, On
Feb. 2 he emerged from his dig-
gings, saw his own shadow, and,
fearing rain, immediately pushed
on to his destination, Jerusalem,
where he made his headquarters.
There he joined other members of
the ASOR and went to Jericho,
Egypt and the Lower Nile (where
a special over-flowing of the banks

-was held in his honor) and flew over

the Dead Sea area... here a far-
away-look came into the professor's
closed eyes—which in itself is a
good trick — as he raised his
clenched fists to’ his brow... “I
can see the Shephelah now.” All the
while he was taking pictures from
Lebon to Egypt. When we asked
if we might run the above picture
he reluctantly answered with a neg-
ative,

Prof. Eberhardt was particu-
larly impressed with the pe-
culiarity of the Atab—and visa
versa. Instead of the expected
sheet clad camel operators he
found 90 percent living in well
developed towns, The other 10
percent were sheet clad camel
operators.

The most irritating thing about
his desert trips? The packs of cam-
els which were mean and constant-
ly up to mischief. They: reminded
him of the Davidson faculty meet-
ings when each student’s schedule
was looked up so all reviews could
come on one day. Other than in-
stances with the camels there were
ho unpleasantries, unless you count
the time his entire party almost
lost their lives. A flash rain caught
them in the Arabian desert near the
spot where David sent Uriah to
his death in battle so he might wed
the beautiful Bath-Sheba. Instan-
taneously the desert was turned into
a sea of mud. They were marooned.
When out of the thundering paths
a lorry (ten-wheel British truck)
chanced to come along and car-
ried them to safety. Dangerous
Arab bands were in that section
but luckily the truck reached them
first.

The retucn trip was made by way
of Cyprus (‘this -was heavenly—
skiing, swimming, sailing in March
—perfect climate — only 120 miles
long—location of Shakespeare's
“Othello”’—(wish we could move
Davidson there), Patmus, where
John wrote Revelations; Greece,
whére he retraced Paul’s footsteps:
Athens, Corinth, Nice, London and
finally via the Queen Mary to New
