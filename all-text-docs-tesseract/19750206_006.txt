‘Playing Dead

The chief of the players tells one of his actors the art of dying as Guildenstern and

Rosencrantz (bottom right) look on.

The opening of ‘‘Murder on the Orient
Express”’ glistens with electricity as the
names Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall,
Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, John
Gielgud, Windy Hiller, Vanessa
Redgrave, Rachel Roberts and Richard
Widmark, among others, appear one af-
ter the other on a brilliant field of pink
p-ovided by the cinematography of the
talented Geoffrey Unsworth.

But the movie is jolted rapidly from the
promise of its opening as the stultifying
direction of Sidney Lumet takes a firm
hold. Only a few moments escape this
death-lock: the movie’cannot help but be
exciting when either Widmark or Hiller
is present, and there is a wonderful scene

toward the end when Lumet manages to |

exploit the myth-value of his stars with
rather more success than usual.

Lumet is not a director who couid wrap
his performers in a whirl of mise-en-
scene, nor is he a director who would be
likely to make any large demands upon
their dramatic abilities.

He is a rarity among directors in that,
for some unimaginable reason, he has
always preferred fine actors to com-
monplace ones, and furthermore, he ac-
tually manages as often as not to cast
them in roles which ought to work well
for them.

But he never gives them any guidance.
He accepts good, bad, and uneven acting

*as though they were all one. With very
few exceptions--Ralph Richardson and
‘Jason Robards in “A Long Day’s Jour-

ney Into Night’’ are obvious ones-- the
performers in Lumet’s films are more in-
teresting for what they have alone
elsewhere than fer what they accomplish
at present.

As is the case in ‘‘Murder on the Orient
Express’’, where Finney, Balsam,
Bergman, Bisset, Cassel, Hiller, Roberts
and Widmark are wasted in roles which
suit them quite nicely, and Bacall, Con-
nery, Gielgud, Perkins, Redgrave and
York are cast slightly ajar.

Gielgud and Perkins are fitted too
rigidly according to type. They have

played, respectivély, the prim, older gen- .

reel to reel

‘Murder On The Orient Express”

and vitality, beginning to look cast-in-
bronze.

Bacall and Connery would be difficult
to place well in any circumstances, for
both are innocent of acting abilities.
Bacall, however, makes up in beauty and
historical value what she lacks in talen‘.
Connery must be written off as a loss, a
virtually inevitable consequence of
watching a Lumet movie.

Lumet’s recurring interest in Connery
is the worst blot on his casting escut-
cheon. Any director who allows his per-
sonality to be represented by Connery
had best not expect to be held in too fond

» regard. If what Redgrave does under

Lumet can be taken as any indication of
the limitations of her talents--and
perhaps it cannot--she is not suited for
lower-class roles.

York.is normally a fine actor, but here,
cast in the nothing role of a dashing
romantic lead, he overacts, trying to
make up for the vacuousness of his part,
and York’s talent is not for overacting. A
good director would have told him so.

Of the more successful performers,
Windy Hiller and Rachel Roberts are
best. The screenplay is a fine but weak
one, and, unfortunately, Hiller and
Roberts work within the confines of their
roles instead of blasting them to pieces
(a much jollier approach tu acting in my
Opinion, and one which is especially
recommended to actors working in films
so poor as ‘‘Murder on the Orient Ex-
press’’). °

But taking into consideration the con-
fines of their roles, they are brilliant.
They have the power of, and are about as
satisfying as, Artur Rubenstein playing
the piano with only his left hand.

Robert’s smile at being complimented
on her abilities as a cook is a miracle of
acting; this is the first cameo ap-
pearance I have seen by her in which she
is not totally wasted.

Finney, Balsam, Bergman, Bisset and
Cassel all do fine work though nothing
particularly memorable. Like Hiller and
Roberts, they must save their full powers
for another time. Most disappointing of

Vernon Rich was 31 years old,
serving a life sentence for first
degree murder, for a crime he
committed in 1968, in Salisbury,
N.C. He had worked his way up
from Raleigh’s Central Prison
to the honor grade status he
held at the Huntersville unit.

While there, he expressed an
interest in writing, wondering if
someone might be interested in
working with and advising him.
He found that someone in Da-

. vidson Professor of English
Tony Abbott.
Their first few meetings soon
gave birth to ‘an idea--Vernon
suggested a weekly newspaper
column on life iff prison; Abbott
liked the idea, although his only

experience with prisons was the
few encounters with Vernon.
Wister Jackson, editor of the
Mecklenburg Gazette, was also
receptive to the idea, and so

November of 1973.

Charlie Chaplin, from approximately
1917 to 1925, is the only movie actor who
is clearly and outstanding great: one can
look between the lines of his less inspired
moments and still tell a great artist is at
work.

Chaplin is to actors what Marie
Falconetti is to actresses, a high level of
achievement one hardly expects to see
equalled in a century. Beneath Falconet-
ti, there are at least half a dozen great
actresses but, beneath Chaplin, the next
best actors are major ones who oc-
casionally rise to greatness.

A difference between these actors and
Chaplin is that they seem to be tran-
scending themselves rather than

- working on their own levels when they

rise to greatness.

On this second level of actors. is
Richard Widmark, whose best period
came in the 40’s and 50’s. Like Garbo,-he
had‘a face one could read innumerable
emotions into, even if, perhaps, at the
time a particular shot was being made,
he may not have been thinking of
anything in particular, or even have been
trying to act.

A change of lighting or camera angle
could bring a whole novel of new
emotions into play. Among the near-
great actors, he was the only one who
looked like a great actor; none of the
screen’s great actresses looked like
great actresses, and Chaplin never
looked like a great actor.

Widmark didn’t have to fight against a
current, to struggle for the illusion of
looking as he really didn’t look, before he

could achieve moments of greatness. He,

had a head start and enough acting
ability to carry him the rest of the way.

He was an exciting, physical, energetic
performer--the kind movies were born to
use; the best performance I have seen by
him, in ‘Pickup on South Street” (1953),
is also the most volatile. I know of no per-
former who experimented with screen
presence as well.

Widmark, at 61, is still handsome anda
very fine actor. Though he doesn’t have
all the abilities he once had, there remain

“Penal Colony”’ materialized in

4 tleman and the cajlow, neurotic youthso _ all is what Lumet does--or rather, doegn’t larger reserves than a director like

g often that they segm to be suffocating in  do--with Richard Widmark, whois castin Lumet can beginto tap.

For the next five months, Ab-
bott. and Vernon, the ‘‘bushy-
haired” man, as he dubbed him-
self in the column, co-authored
a weekly column, some col-
umns written together, some by
Vernon alone. A man of great
natural talent, Vernon learned
quickly, struggling to express
all of the complex problems and
emotions involved in life with-
out freedom.

He wrote of the crowded,
inhuman conditions, of the lack
of organization, money, ana
manpower needed to carry out
proper rehabilitation
programs, of frustration and
loneliness, of homosexuality in
prison, of those who fought back
through the system for appeals
and re-trials.

He tried to examine the
reasons people went to prison,
and why they so often came
back. Continually educating

‘himself, in literature and law,

he became a ‘‘jail-house
lawyer,’’ using his few worn law
books to aid his fellow
“colonists.”’ :

In their column, he and Ab-
bott also educated their reading
public, giving them glimpses in-
to the monotonous, lonely life of
men in prison—a place Vernon
called ‘‘a zoo,’’ where men were

slowly stripped of their
motivation, pride, and
humanity.

Vernon disliked the penal in-
stitution because ‘‘it doesn’t
solve anything.”’ And so Vernon
worked, from -inside prison
walls, to try to change and im-
prove conditions.

Together he and Abbott
wrote their column, appeared
on television and at schools and
clubs; Vernon helped organize

a Jaycee chapter at-the Hun- —

tersville prison unit. His short
story, ‘Just Thinking,’’ was ac-
cepted in the Davidson
Miscellany.

He was active in working
towards penal reform and in
improving the Inmates Legal
Facility, although he was not
furnished with the North

Carolina General Statutes or .

any law books besides his few

prison, of his fellow ‘‘colonists,”’
and of the need for penal
reform.

He and Abbott have continued
their co-authored column,
featuring many articles by Ver-
non alone,

In his June 5, 1974 column,
Vernon wrote of the social
reform introduced by the
Quakers 200 years ago, which
replaced capita! and corporal
punishment with im-
prisonment:

“Quakers, you were wrong,
why did it take you so long to

_Yealize it? We in, the Penal

Colony are a part of your
creation. .. We have been con-
sumed by it. . . we are in the
belly of your monster and the
digestive juices that flow
among us, working to excrete
us back into society, we are not
happy people. ey

“Most of us know that society
looks down upon us even after
the monster has swallowed us
and spit us back, and it is hard
for us to re-adjust to the norms
we were jerked out of by your
monster. We struggle when the
going gets tough, we go back to
the behavior patterns that we
learned for survival in the laien
land of idleness, bar’, and con-
crete.

“We love our country and
most of us want to get back to
our families and friends and
live a crime-free life. Quakers,
if you can change the behavior °
of your monster which has been
bestowed upon you by heir of
those before you. . . we can
change ours. . . but, we cannot
wait another two hundred |
years.” |

And now what for Vernon
Rich? He is not a man to give up
easily. I recall our first
meeting and open discussion
on the Lazy-B trial, last fall-I
was at first put off by his rather
rough manner and his “‘I-know-
I’m-right, damn ‘it, and-you-
should-agree’’ attitude, but af-
ter listening and talking to him,
it was evident how much he

personal copies. The struggles *:

had been hard, but seemed to be

paying off. And then on April 29,

1974, Vernon ran, accompanied
’ by two fellow inmates. eae
Why did Vernon run? Why did =:

he jeopardize what seemed to
be such a promising future? No
one really knows, but these
words from Vernon’s last col-
umn before his escape, ones he
wrote entirely on his own, may
provide some insight:

“. . . I wrote you about five
minutes ago a letter about what
I was going to do when I got out.
All that future stuff, not
realizing the nowness: of
everything. . . then as I read it
over, I had’ this thought. . .
about all the people in this
world being in some sort of
prison

**.. . it may not be bars, con-
crete, armed guards and bar-
bed wire like we are in, but still
they have a prison. . . it’s hard

for them to escape. . . it is hard ee
for them to communicate with

in other
. that’s

those incarcerated
prisons. . . a few do. .

lucky for the others, for they
are able to see-the many man-

made cell blocks. . .’’'
After his recapture, Vernon
was feturned to Central Prison
in Raleigh. From there, he has
