Proposal Submitted
For Gay Liberation

To the Editor:
Arise Davidson men, and
burn your _ nutthuggers,

freeballers, swing easies, and
Model D's! The time has come
to liberate yourself of those
restricting undergarments.

Come with me and form a
chapter of Gay (Yes, I'm gay
and proud as hell of it!)
Liberation Front on this cam-
pus to spread our interests.
With such a movement, no
longer need you be ashamed of
eating corn and redeye.

Gays around the world have
come together and proclaimed
their love of their fellow man
(and animal). And we can do

likewise if you will gather
around our banner. We could
truly make Davidson “the home
of the whopper’.

I have drawn up a list of 21
demands to submit to the
college for immediate action,
including daily mandatory gym
showers so that we can see what
everyone has to offer (for to
quote Shakespeare, “‘Thereby
hangs a tale’’). We would also
demand that suitable housing
be constructed to house our
dates.

Join the Front and be the first
lucky Pierre on Your hall!

learned that education must
proceed cautiously but
regularly. Experience of the
years and an understanding of
history has generated a new
logic which I apply to all my
decisions. I call it the logic of
hindsight, or ‘logic in reverse’

‘This simply means that for
any given situation, we must
reason backwards, from con-
clusions to premisses

‘And we have no more
suitable conclusions than the
facts and experiences of each
day. In my logic we look behind
lo correct our mistakes. and
not worry over how the future

may influence the future per-

fect.

ALAN BARAGONA

‘As I work each day, I see the
mistakes we made a few years
ago perpetuating themselves,
guiding our current mistakes.
This Honors College system is
today in a terrible mess. We've
lost our best teachers and
students. I submit its time for a
change.

‘Now I think the only
reasonable solution is to expand
rather than curtail the present
system. We have some good
students left. Why, I saw. one
just the other day. Its unfair to
punish him for the mistakes and
unconcern of others.

‘It seems to me that the
Honors College should be
enlarged, pushed out at every
position. First. we would make
every student a member of the
Honors College.

‘This solves our biggest
problem. That of admissions. I
confess that after five years I
still don't know of any selection
system we use. If we like
them, then they're in.

‘This done, we preserve our
selectivity by requiring ap-
plications for admission to the
regular courses meeting each
day.

‘If only the best students can
get to class, this will dry up the
criticism of faculty members,
who claim we've placed our-
selves above the regular college
and taken the best students out

of class.

‘So putting everybody in the
Honors College would restore a
better balance to education
here. I'm convinced of that. In
addition, we can just keep a lit-
tle more hot water around here
and turn this building into a
Union.

‘Now instead of a small elite
group here we can have a big
elite group of 1,000. This solves
the Student Union crisis, and it
settles the controversy over ex-
clusion, just like the trustees
did with fraternities. If we can't
do anything constructive. at
least we can redefine our
position and make the problem
vanish.

‘Now we can claim that every
student has scheduling benefits
and freedoms. (I hope you have
a list of those benefits and
freedoms. I lost mine.) In
making this move we could at-
tract national publicity again.
Its a good way to take credit for
some positive educational
achievement, without taking
any risk at all.

‘So you see, its not really a
step forward or backward. We
just wait a few years. And this
seems entirely consistent with
all our philosophy and practice.

‘Many thanks, I await your
reaction.”

Mott The Wopple Lists Letters
From Affectionate Admirers

Dear Mr. the Wopple,

At the recent convention of
the MLA mention was made of
your literary debt to Reynard
the Fow, Pilgrim's Progress,
and Listen to the Warm, largely
from the view of psycosocio-
histological influence. 1
took issue with the men-
tioner, pointing out the much
more obvious use of Dantean
waler imagery and_ the
Jamesian (Henry) con-
sciousness in conflict with the
Jungian overtones of the Kud-
zuvain tradition. I would like to
know if Northrop is right or if I
am.

I. A. Richards

Dear Mr. the Wopple.

I have read all your columns
and cannot fathom your sym-
bolism. I think we could all use
a Who's Who in Mott the Wop-
ple’s Column.

Student Body

Dear Mr. the Wopple,

I have read your column and
would like to be friends with you
because you like flowers and
youth and stuff and wear
sneakers and are friends with
the sea and Jean and cats and
pretty green things.

Dear Mr. the Wopple,

In a joint effort, we of the
Stanford Math and Logic
Departments have run your
columns through three banks of

computers and all they read
back is Finnegan's Wake. How
do you account for this?
