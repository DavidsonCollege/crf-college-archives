Hamilton Analyses .
United Nation's Veto

Mr. (Thomas Jefferson Hamilton,
chief of the New York Times’
United Nation, staff delivered an
interesting and informative lecture
to several hundred members of the
faculty and student body Tuesday
evening, February 15. Mr. Hamil-
ton analyzed the problem of the veto
which tas been in the limelight
since the San Francisco Conference.
Through the use of his veto the
fundamental ‘Weaknesses in. the
structure of the United Nations have
become evident. Because of this veto
power the work of the U.N., and
particularly the Security Council,
has been definitely hampered. Be-
cause of this veto power, which
rests in the hands of the five major
powers, the Western allies have
turned to regional agreement in their
search for peace and security. At
the present time there are three
regional agreements with the United
States serving as the bulwark in
each. Mr. Hamilton believes that the
only’ way for world peace exists in
these regional agreements.

In spite of the many shortcom-
ings of the U. N, Mr, Hamilton
points to the work the United Na-
tions and its agencies have success-
fully done. His criticism of the
agencies is that they are spreading
their efforts over too wide an area.

For dear old Alma Mater

We'll tell you what we heard

We'll hit the goal when we are through.

A little bird said we’d do some building
Expand our campus wide and far

So won’t you give until it hurts you brother,
Reach down into your savings jar

There’s no use denying it—it’s gonna take some cash
But if we all get down to work, we'll raise it in a flash!

Go ’round your town

See all your friends and neighbors
Tell them just what we’re gonna do.

We'll build a great big church to congregate,
A brand new gym where we'll beat State,

A student union big and fine

Put your money on the dotted line.

A brand new dorm where we can live

Only fellows if you'll all give

Now that’s the way the birdie told us we could do it
And we have passed it on to you

The little birdie told us we could do it

And we believe that it is true, 00, 00, oo, TRUE — True!

dollars, Beta Theta Pi an-
nounced that it had raised well
over half of its quota in the

been assumed by the members,
Beta is well on its way to
