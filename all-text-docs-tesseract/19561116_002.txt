Louisville vs. Washington Chaos

Dr. Omer Carmichael’s straightfor-
ward, low-pressure presentation of how
the Louisville, Kentucky schools were in-
tegrated this fall apparently sums up the
formula for successful desegregation in
the fringe areas of the nation.

Keynoted by its thorough prepara-
tion before actual integration, the Louis-
ville approach, where Dr. Carmichael is
superintendent of schools, will undoubt-
edly be adopted by school boards in
border states with similar situations.
Without concerted opposition and with
a more or less limited Negro population,
this scheme will usually be sufficient
to meet the demands of the Court.

It was fortunate that Dr. Carmichael
geared his talk on the matter-of-fact plane
which he did, and that he did not intimate
that his experience could or should be-
come a pat plan for integration activity
farther south. Courteous student recep-
tion of the talk reflected creditably the
attitude in which it was delivered.

We cannot help but realize however,
that integration throughout the South is
not going to follow the comparatively
smooth Louisville pattern. On the other
hand, it will in all probability be sadly
similar to the chaotic situation now exist-
ing in the nation’s capital.

Effectively hushed by the Washington
school board for many months, a con-
gressional investigating committee and
a thoroughly aroused press have finally
taken the wraps off conditions which have
virtually disrupted the effective operation
of the Washington public schools. While
Northern liberals screamed, and Time
magazine unloosed its smear-pots, wit-
ness after witness paraded before the
southern-dominated committee, telling of
the status of the schools.

The pro-integration Washington press
reluctantly admitted that they have an
“intolerable” situation on their hands,
and the Washington Star went so far as
to say that unless drastic remedial mea-
sures were taken immediately, the condi-
tion “will deterixorate to a point that
stamps integration as 9 failure, with the
most deplorable effects on the character
of this great city”.

While the race problem over the
South cannot be compared with that of
Washington or Louisville or any other
one city, it seems safe to assume that the
results of integration where racial feel-

ing is backed by years of custom will be
a far cry from the quiet proceedings in
Louisville, and could conceivably make
even Washington’s knotty problems look
minor in comparison.

We cannot help but wonder if such a
situation as exists in Washington could
ever be publicly aired from the Davidson
platform as was done yesterday with the
contrastingly smooth transition in Louis-
ville.

The College has a traditionally-neg-

lected duty to present all legitimate sides

of the issues which confront us. A com-
munity which likes to think of itself as
intellectual in outlook cannot afford to
intentially or unintentially suppress con-
flicting viewpoints. And yet except in ex-
tremely rare instances, only one side of
the race situation has been presented
since it came to a head in May, 1954.

Both responsible and _ irresponsible
men have come to present the case for
integration. We have no quarrel at all

with the right or even the advisability of |

having these men speak here. We do
challenge the college’s corisistent failure
to present the other side of the story, if
the controversy is to be presented at all.

In our tight little world, too many of
us assume that those who differ with us,
and especially on this particular issue,
are automatically rabble-rousing, unin-
tellectual bigots, who are living in the Old
South of mint juleps under the moonlit
magnolias. Much too often, this charge
is partly true. But this is not the whole-
sale Southern attitude, and there are
many dedicated, intellectually respecta-
ble speakers who could be secured to
present their well thought-out views in
a calm and unemotional manner.

In the past, the college’s attitude to
proposals of this type has been that if
interested students would like to secure
a speaker who would deviate from the
usual pattern, chapel time would be glad-
ly alloted. But with this policy, the Col-
lege is simply dodging its responsibility
for objective and complete presentation
of issues which will concern us as citizens.

Presentation last year of the labor-
management wrangle in the South by ‘rep-
resentatives of both sides in successive
weeks provides a model for future pro-
grams of. a controversial nature, regard-
less of the specific matters involved.

Noted Personalities to Visit Campus

In one fell swoop Davidson will have
two world renowned personalities in its
midst when Eleanor Roosevelt and Billy
Graham visit the campus on the weekend
of December 7-9.

Controversial and provocative, these
two in particular will elicit the attention
of the students and interested outsiders.
There will be no lack of interest or at-
tendance at their public appearances.

In belonging to the Liberal Arts Col-
lege family, we have indicated that we be-
lieve education is more than just knowl-
edge crammed in on one specialized field.
Our definition of the learned man in-
cludes the ability to be at home in many
places, to be familiar with the great ideas
and aesthetic expressions of the ages,
and, if not a real appreciation, at least
a sympathetic tolerance for that area of
life which is designated as “Fine Arts’.

It is during our college days, when we
experience our greatest growth intellectu-
ally and formulate roughly tastes that
will remain the rest of our lives, that an
awareness of the lasting and elevating
qualities in music, poetry, dramatics, et
al ought to be awakened.

Monday night Philippe Entremont will

be here. During the remainder of the
year, an outstanding singer, a Shake-
spearean performance, a demonstration
of art in the creation, and a Boy’s Choir
provide the program for the Artist Series.

One distressing note along these lines
is that to the way of thinking of several
of the student body the quality of the
presentations on the Davidson Artist
Series has been slipping in recent years.
Four years ago such talent as Charles
Laughton, Claude Rains, Robert Frost,
Jan Pierce, and the Dublin Players visit-
ed Davidson. This year there is hardly a
name, with the exception of Mrs. Roose-
velt, who is appearing in a role that is
more educational than cultural, that
catches the student attention as the above
do.

There is a need for a double-pronged
challenge then. One is to the Davidson
student to make an honest effort to
grow in artistic response quite as he
would in other phases of campus life and
the other is to the administration to seek
every method possible to obtain and pre-
sent the outstanding personalities and
performances to the campus.

Dear Editor:

Before we let the idle pleasures
of our first dance weekend slip
from our memory there are a few
points which should be discussed.

The administration should cer-
tainly be applauded for doing away
with the outdated rule that made
couples clear the fraternity houses
two hours after the dances.

This is certainly an improve-
ment and one which everyone
thinks is better. The only ques-
tion is why stop halfway?

If it’s all right on Friday night,
what is the hold up on Saturday?
The new rule allows people to

Let’s Revise Rules on Dance
Weekend Parking and Housing

remain in the houses Saturday
morning until 4:30 a.m. However,
on Saturday night the two-hour
rule is back into effect.

This succeeds in driving every-
one off campus on Saturday night
which seems to be exactly what
the administration doesn’t want to
happen. )

PARKING ON CAMPUS

Another point in this line of
discussion is the “parking” situa-
tion. Many cities have found a
similar problem to that found by
the school.

Most of these places at first

Painting White Lines at Several
Parking Areas Would Add Space

Dear Editor,

In hopes that this letter will
somehow reach the attention of
the proper college officials, I am
writing to you. It concerns a prob-
lem that has been before us for
the past several years—the park-
ing situation.

The problem is becoming more
serious each year, and will prob-
ably continue doing so.

The college has recognized and
anticipated this problem, and has
helped to improve the situation
by increasing the parking area,
especially on the west side of Belk.

T believe, however, that the col-
lege has not gone far enough in
providing the maximum amount
of parking space in the parking
areas.

In order to improve the parking
situation, I propose, first, that the
paved areas behind East, West,
and Duke be lined off.

At present the cars in these

areas are being parked rather hap-
hazardly, taking up too much
room, and thereby limiting the
parking space. Lining these areas
would solve this problem.

Secondly, I believe HMning the
area behind the house on the
road leading to the back of the
gym would create additional park-
ing spaces.

Thirdly, I believe the removal
of the large concrete slab behind
East is necessary. I know of sev-
eral cars that have been caught
by this slab, and it could cause
serious damage. This area could
be filled in also.

Finally, the newly paved areas
in the Belk parking lot should be
lined off. This should have: been
done before school started.

I don't believe these proposals,
if carried out, would tax the col-
lege treasury too much, and I’m
sure the parking problem would
be improved.

Many Incentives Offered to
Donors in Campus Blood Drive

Dear Editor,

The Davidson student body will
have the opportunity to give their
blood to the Red Cross on Decem-
ber 3-4.

The IFC is sponsoring this blood
drive, and the ROTC department
is doing most of the actual mechan-
cal details.

The fraternity with the largest
percentage of donors will be given

THE
BLOODMOBILE

iS COMING

a plaque for their fraternity house.
In addition, the IFC will reduce
the cost of the Mid-Winter’s dance
tickets for those in the winning
fraternity.

As an added incentive, the
ROTC will give a free drill cut
to every ROTC cadet who gives
blood. Even if he gives on Monday,
he will not be required to attend
drill on Tuesday.

Last year’s response to the blood
drive was very poor. It is our
duty to make this year’s blood
drive the most successful ever to
be held on the Davidson campus.
Let's all give to the Blood Drive
on December 34.

W.G.C.

used police force to prohibit this
popular sport and later found it
was hopeless.

Searching for a solution they
finally realized that “if you can’t
lick them join them.” As a result
most modern youths have been
used to police protected parking
areas, only to come to Davidson
and be driven from their cozy
haven.

This results only in driving the

parkers off the campus and down .

the road to a less romantic and
much dangerous spot,

I firmly believe that the Col-

lege ought to consider both of

these proposals. If couples were
allowed to stay in the fraternity
houses later on Saturday night
fewer mothers would have grey
hair. .

Similarly, if students were al-
lowed to “park” on the campus
rather than being forced down
the road, Cop Linker would have
a more pleasant weekend.

Mobile X-Ray Unit
To Be on Campus
During Next Week

Dear Editor:

I noticed in the last issue of the
Davidsonian a highly pertinent an-
nouncement concerning chest
x-rays.

X-rays are extremely helpful in
determining whether or not any of
the Davidson men have tubercu-
losis.

No one wants to be called
“Tubercular Tom” by his ex-pals,
now does he? To avoid this, won't
you ask the students to give their
attention to this matter?

The heavier smokers on campus
will be interested to know that
the unit now carries a “tobaccou-
losis” detector which will x-ray
their chest and then inform them
whether or not they are smoking
the proper brand of cigarettes.

This new machine is sponsored
by the R. J. Reynolds Company,
a non-profit organization which is
combating tuberculosis.

Also, the mobile unit offers a
prime opportunity to some of the
poorer scholars to pass at least
ene exam this semester.

Even the Administration and
their secretaries are going to be
x-rayed. They, too, could be car-
riers of the deadly germ. I beg
that the student body join in with
them next week when the oppor-
tunity presents itself.

After all, the students want to
be allowed to return to. school
after the holidays, don’t they?

PENETRATES ACADEMIC PROGRAM

Movement For A.B.

Demands

By LAURENS WALKER

During the past two months stu-
dent opinion at Davidson has
moved against one of the several
seemingly unreasoned aspects of
the college’s academic program,
the requirements for the A.B. de-
gree.

This sort of movement is not
new to the Davidson campus, for
some six years ago a similar stu-
dent group managed to push a pro-
posal for the elimination of the
ancient language requirement as
far as the Board of Trustees, only
to have it cut down by the frantic
efforts of a radically conservative
faculty member.

The reason behind such a re-
quirement change has been obvi-
ous to the student body since dis-
cussion was first begun on the
matter. Perhaps Davidsonians have
been too ready to understand and
then drop the subject.

NOW 1S THE TIME

Perhaps this is the time to not
only ask the faculty for such a
change in degree requirements,
but to press for a long needed gen-
eral revision in the academic pro-
gram of the college.

Such a revision should include,
particularly, basic changes in the
required curriculum. With these
curriculum changes, the degree
requirement changes would be
come, not just surface revisions,
but evidences of an improvement
and modernization of the Davidson
scholastic program.

WOULD STRENGTHEN DEGREES

Through these changes just
mentioned, and by disassociating
the A.B., from the B.S., both de-
grees could be strengthened, par-
ticularly the B.S., considered now
by many to be inferior to
the A.B. This idea of a needed re-
vision of the academic program
is not a new one to the Davidson

campus.

Support

There have been many well
thought out programs suggested. It
is not my purpose to propose a
detailed program, but only to sug-
gest that this is a time for action.

The suggested improvements al-
ready analyzed and found work-
able, should be incorporated into
the college's scholastic program im-
mediately.

The requirement matter and the
action taken thus far to improve
the situation have served to make
campus opinion very clear on sev-
eral important points.

REVISION OF PROGRAM

First, Davidsonians definitely
want the change in degree require-
ments, but more than that change,
they are keenly interested in see-
ing a general revision of the col-
lege's academic program so as to
make it more realistic and more
stimulating.

Davidsonians openly question

. Many of the required courses and

sometimes wonder whether they
are pouring their time down aca-
demic drains.

Secondly, Davidsonians are look-
ing to their faculty for concerned
leadership in these matters. They ©
are hoping that future proposals
will be greeted with open minds .
and friendly attitudes so that the
general welfare of the college
might be served. .

HOPE FOR RESULTS

Lastly, the student body is hop-
ing not to receive from the Board
of Trustees another example of
complete disregard for student
opinion and preference, similar to
the enrollment decision of last
year.

The current degree question is
then much broader than it at first
appears. It penetrates deep into
the heart of Davidson's academic
program and is a powerful indi-
cation of the need for immediate
reform.

Shelf after shelf in the library's
Davidsoniana Room are filled with
writings by and about Woodrow
Wilson.

Giant glass cases are devoted to
the preservation of Wilsonian
relics, and some of the walls are
covered with pictures of the 28th
President of ‘the United States,
who attended Davidson during a
part of one school year before
going North to Princeton for his
education.

Ever since Mr. Wilson was
elected to the Presidency, Da-
vidson has basked in his re
flected glory, and hes capital.
ized on every available oppor-
tunity to take some credit for
his accomplishments.

This year, to celebrate the one
hundredth anniversary of his
birth, this has been carried to ri-
diculous extremes, and a protest is
long overdue.

In many cases, tradition is one
thing, and reality is another, and
the preservation of tradition at
the price of hypocricy is incon-
sistent with other, more funda-
mental traditions of honesty, in-
tegrity, and truth to which David-
son also proudly lays claim.

At this point, die-hard tradition-
alists will protest, “But Mr. Wilson
always said nice things about Da-
vidson.” Of course he did, because
Mr. Wilson was a gentleman, and
gentlemen don’t say unkind things
about anything, at least not in
public.

Do we really know for sure
what he really thought of De
videon, especially the David-
son of 1870 es compared to
Princeton of the same era?

So let us leave further evologies
to Princeton, which did more to
make Wilson what he was, and was
much more a product of his ability,
and let us place a sign on the
edge of the campus to read “Wood-
row Wilson slept here.”

It isn't as flattering, it is true,
but it is much more realistic.

One of the perennial criticisms

which has been leveled at David-
son on many occasions is that it

FROM THE TOP
of the

DOME

with

pushes its students into a nar-
row cultural and intellectual pat-
tern of conformity that destroys
intellectual freedom.

it should be remembered
that Davidson serves an upper
middle-class, Southern, white,
Presbyterian business and pro-
fessional clientele, and conse
quently, most of us were born
into the pattern we accuse Da-
vidson of forcing around us.
This has both advantages end
disadvantages.

Most of us here are fortunate
enough to have parents who are
financially able to send us to col-
lege without undue strain on the
family budget.

On the other hand, many of us
come to Davidson because people
in our parents’ income bracket all
send their sons to college.

Within the pattern described
above, security is so easily come
by that our religious convictions
are seldom severely tested, and
consequently do not escape from’
the “Sunday-School” stage.

We go to church, say and do
the “right” things, and behave re-
spectably most of the time.

But how often do we ask our-
selves: “What do I really believe,
and why do I believe it?”

Our cultural pattern pro
vides us with the money, the
time, and the opportunity to
learn what is going on in the
world and to develop talents
which will be beneficial to so-
clety.

It is also a breeding ground for
narrow mindedness, bigotry, hypoc-
ricy, and neglect of our fellow
men.

The point here is that our cul-
tural pattern is intrinsically nei-
ther good nor bad; we create its
moral values by our actions with-
in it.

Secondly, Davidson does not
force us into this pattern. If any-
thing, its intellectual, if not actual,
contact with other points of view
provides us with many opportuni-
ties for breaking the pattern.
Whether we do or not, is up to
us.
