Alternative 3 Ifestyles

Service Corps symposium will challenge students

By MERIDETH DURDEN
Features Editor

“Alternative Lifestyles” will
be the theme of a major sympo-
sium held on campus Sunday,
October 8 - Tuesday, October
10. Sponsored'by the Y Student
Service Corps, the symposium
is designed to expose Davidson

students, residents, and visi-_,

tors to the work being done by
those who seek alternative ways
of life amidst the urbanized,
centralized society of modern
America. Several speakers will
participate in the three day
event, including representatives
of urban, rural, religious and
political alternative organiza-
tions.

Two fundamental beliefs a-
mong those seeking alternatives
are that Americans are too
materialistic in their priorities
and consumption habits and
that modern society, with its
Big Business and Big Govern-
ment, does not allow enough
individual freedonr. Organizers
of the symposium hope that
those who disagree with these
ideas will attend and participate
as actively as those who share
the alternative viewpoint.
—__“This is by far the most
ambitious project the Service
Corps has undertaken in the
. past year,” said Glen Darby-
shire, Y president, ‘‘and we
hope that students will take
advantage of this opportunit?
to hear these dynamic and
dedicated leaders. Not only will .
there be lectures and films, wut
time has been set aside for
students to discuss their own
ideas with our visitors. In
addition, there will be displays
concerning the organizations

and writings of the speakers.”

The symposium will begin
with a vegetarian dinner on
Sunday evening at 5:30 in
Chambers Art Gallery. Reser-
vations can be made by signing
up at the Union Desk, and the
meal will cost $1.50. A program
introducing the Alternative
Movement will follow the meal
and a film entitled “Living the

___Good Life” will be shown at:

9:00 p.m. in Perkins Auditori-
um. >

Monday’s activities include a
program on Urban and Rural
alternative modes of living at
10:00 a.m. in the Gallery, dis-
cussions and interviews with
the guests from 2:00 until 4:00
p:m. in the 900 Room and a
program that evening entitled
‘Why not mainstream Ameri-
ca? Practical Applications.”’

On Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. in
the Gallery the speakers will
discuss the political activities of
their organizations, and at 1
p-m. in the 900 Room an
informal talk on Alternative
Diets will be given. The campus
worship service at DCPC that
evening will be led by one of the
speakers interested in alterna-
tive means of celebrating religi-
ous évents. |

“The SePvice Corps has invi-
ted leaders of alternative orga-
nizations who are qualified to
speak about this unique mix-
ture of liberal and conservative
ideas,” said Darbyshire. ‘These
are not leftovers from the 1960's
who are stil] blowing their
horus** in faci oat of our
speakers has been involved in
the Alternative movement since
the 1930's.”

earbook co-editors
plan best book ever’

By JOHN SPANGLER
Staff Writer

The 1978-79 Quips and
Cranks is already shaping up to
one of the best issues in recent
years. Under the leadership of
co-editors Lana Sims and Steve

‘Cline the thirty-sémé members

of the yearbook staff have been
working hard. They plan many
improvements upon last year’s
format.

~ Lana and Steve would like to
see several basic changes effec-
ted in the yearbook itself and in
the student body’s involvement
in its production.

“Lana and I have been wor-
king very hard to get people
involved, and we want the
input, said co-editor Cline.
“We do not want people to be
afraid to call up and have speci-
fic incidents put in the annual,
such as dorm socials or hall
mixers.”’ -

This year, the two co-editors
plan new additions to the
annual. More color photogra-
phy and student-candid pic-
tures'are two items.

One of the most ‘important
additions, they feel, will be mug
shots put in with the seniors’
‘candid portraits. Senior mug

shots and candid pictures will

Home-made candid shots at the
eating houses, in the dorms, or
elsewhere around the campus
are especially solicited.

Official mugshots will’ be
made for all students Monday
through Friday beginning on
October 16. Appointments for

- pictures can be- made at the

Union Desk. Everyone, especi-
ally Seniors who may not think
it necessary, should go by and
have their protraits made.

Stated Sims, ‘‘We want each
student to have ‘his picture
taken for a two fold reason; not
only will this give us the four
classes’ pictures, but also this
will enable us to do more with
the yearbook -- such as using
more color photography -- if a
total response is shown by the
students.”

If anyone has any questions
or even suggestions regarding
the ’78-'79 Quips and Cranks, or
if anyone is interested in sub-
mitting photography to the

_ yearbook, he should contact

Cline and Sims at the Yearbook
office in the Union. Office hours
are Monday through Thursday
from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. Seniors
are also reminded to have their
candid shots made and to drop
them by the yearbook office in

the near future.

“This is for identification
more than anything,”’ Cline
explained. ‘Many times, a sé-
nior cannot be recognized in his
candid, expecially if he has his
picture made with a group of
friends.” ’

‘Cline and Sims would like to
have more student photography
used in this year’s annual.
