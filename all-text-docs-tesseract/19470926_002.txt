Bon Voyage...

To every member of the Davidson student |
body and administration, the staff of the!
DAVIDSONIAN takes this opportunity to wish
a happy and successful scholastic year.

Although we are sincere in our well-wish- |
ing, we do it not in the spirit of January the
First revelers, but more in the spirit of a|
person bidding bon-voyage to-friends depart- |
ing on a long ocean journey, perilous but
promising great reward if well-sailed, |

Actually an analogy between the school
year and a nine-month’s ocean trek is not
far-fetched, for there are numerous parallels.
Ahead of us all lie days of smooth sailing,
and-just as surely, days of troubled waters.
There will undoubtedly be disagreement
between the faculty-officers and the student-
sailors; the officers will have the final word,
but none can doubt the rights of the thousand
sailors will be respected. Some of the weak
will succumb to the perils of the sea and
never see the shore they have set out for, but
most will take the stormy days with the fair
and ride safely into port in late spring. What
kind of sailor you are depends squarely on
you—if you barely do your job you won’t be
thrown overboard, but neither will you re-
ceive praise from your officers, nor satisfac-
tion with yourself, which is the worst that
can befall a man. You can be an average
seaman, do your job adequately, and also
complete the journey. But only if you put
every ounce of energy into your daily tasks
throughout the voyage, can you reach the
far shore and then enjoy there the joys of the
scholastic promised land. Again, the choice
is up to you, but when you're deciding just
what your attitude and effort will be for
this year, give a moment’s thought to this
most sobering fact: for each of you who
embarks on the scholastic ship this year,
there are two who are left behind to await
another shipment. Were it not for your
presence ®board they would have a chance to
sail this ocean of opportunity. Does your
contribution and effort warrant their being
left standing on the dock? You owe a tre-
mendods debt not only to those who would
like to be shipmates with you, but to all
people ashore, who make your trip possible.

Professor Robert D. Gregg of Carnegie
Tech has expressed this point-blank—it hits
us every one: “In evaluating the worth of a
student and his promise as a future citizen,
scholarship is highly important. While in
my opinion it takes -sécénd place to charac-
ter, it certainly is the core of one’s campus
activities and his main reason for being in
school. Actually society gives a fellow a
furlough of four years or more‘ between high
school and his active work in; the world.
During these four years he is expected by
society to equip himself to fulfill a high role
in life, in other words, be of greater value

to society than he would otherwise be. ‘This|

four-year furlough is achieved with great
expense to parents, friends, some contribu-
ting institution, the government, or oneself.
Also this four years of practically none-
production represents a social sacrifice,
since otherwise the student may have been
‘carrying on,a livelihood. Thus a satisfactory
return must be made to individuals (parents,
etc.) and to society for this investment and
sacrifice that they have made. ‘Certainly

EDITOR

lhe DAVIDSONI AN Presenis

Letters to the
Editor . . .

Dear Editor:

This letter has been hanging fire since
last spring when the present Pan-Hellenic
Council came into power and immediately
assumed the same. Within a few days after
they ascended to their highly responsible
positions, the entire rushing system, tried
and proven through many years, was
abolished, and in its stead came a monstrosity
that all Fraternity Court has this past week
witnessed, aghast at its inaness, but helpless
to combat it.

My grievances against the new rush sys-
tem, and I believe I share them with a vast
majority of the students concerned in this
matter, are so multitudinous as to prohibit
incorporating them into a correlated analysis
of the evils of the recent travesty on rushing
at Davidson, Therefore I will attempt simply
to list them. They appear here in chrono-

last spring and carrying through to the
present.
(1) As implied in my opening paragraph,

Council in a few days completely wrecked
a system which had been established as the
culmination of their many predecessors’ best
thoughts and effort. Surely it was brash

|of these neophytes to assume that none
| before them had ever realized the imperfec-

tions of the old system, and that they,
through superior intellect or inspiration or
both, had the right to blast a respected
system and substitute their cure-all methods
if curing was actually their goal.

(2) Next-I felt that their movements and
decisions during the period of change were

yey e pr
so unpublicized as to be almost subversive.

I believe I represent the majority of the

| fraternity men when I say that “we feel

something was put over on us almost behind
our backs,” for the machinery for the new
system was all set up and operating madly
when word first reached the general campus
as to the Pan-Hellenic Council’s “New Deal.”
A change with the far-reaching implications
of the subject one should certainly have been
aired for discussion by the various fraterni-
ties; instead, it’s importance and _ signifi-
cance were apparently minimized by the
members of the council when they reported
to their fraternities, and in the rush of the
last few weeks of school, the fraternities
were in no position to fully analyze the pro-
posals of the Council. Too the DAVIDSONIAN
chad, I believe, closed down for the season
and the one effective public forum on the
campus could not be utilized by those of us
who wished to combat the change. In short,
I am convinced that the plan, if carried to a
mass vote of the fraternities, would have
been overwhelmed by negation.

(3) Finally I resent the fact that the
incoming freshmen were_ briefed by the
Council to the following effect: “Unfortun-
ately for you soon-to-be-disillusioned boys,
we must report to you that all upperclassmen
in the fraternities here at Davidson are
basically not quite honest, and they will at-
tempt at every turn to circumvent the rules
that we df the Pan-Hellenic Council’ have
‘established. They will try to persuade you
to join their individual fraternities by, any
means deemed effective; flattering glibness,
pressuring, or even intimidation. Don’t listen
to them at all—you are on your honor to
report any fraternity upperclassman who
during rush week inticates that he would
like for you to join his fraternity. All per-
suasive talk is absolutely verbotem—any
upperclassman who goes further than re-
marking that the weather looks _ pleasant
should be reported to us—we’ll fix "em, yes,
sir; we'll fix ’em.”

I know the last paragraph is slightly
exaggerated, but I hope in it I have conveyed
the idea that prevails throughout the upper-
classes: the freshmen should not have their
respect for the men above them shattered
when they have just arrived on the campus.
Perhaps we upperclassmen are scheming
ogres, but shouldn’t the freshmen be allowed
to have someone to look to for example, until
they are established upon the campus?

'If this letter is excessively vehement, I
apologize to those of the Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil who were not behind the plan. To those
who fostered the change and executed it in
such a slip-shod fashion, I would imply
kno bitterness, but please, fellows, for the
sake of those behind us, how about returning
to the old rushing system or suggest changes
in the old system which can be discussed
among us.

Sineerely,

scholarship is the ‘most tangible return.”

Dr. Abernathy’s interests lie in
North Carolina, searching out
points of interest and historical
significance. Touring the state
during the summer with his artist-
wife and son, 7, and daughter, 5,
Dr. Abernathy was impressed with

is quite different from the black

Professor Abernathy, came to
Davidson last year from the Uni-
versity of South Dakota. A grad-
Bucknell University in
Pennsylvania, he was prepared for
higher education in the schools of

uate of

West Orange, New Jersey and
New York City. Before going to
the University of Michigan for

his doctorate, Dr, Abernathy ‘did
graduate work at Oberlin College

in Ohio and at the University of
Wisconsin.

body, as an outstanding character-

Davidson has always had the
reputation of being not merely a
community, but a community of
fellowship and spirit. Professor
Eberhardt, who has recently joined
the college’s Bible Department,
states that he has found that repu-
tation to be a true one.

Dr. Eberhardt is a graduate of
New York University where he

before which he attended New
