ATC, from page 1

Young Democrats last year.This year the ATC
changed its minds about the issue.

“Good leadership pays off,” said Matthews.

Pending passage, next year the Republicans
willreceive a 60 percent budget increase, from
$625 to $1000.

Matthews noted their impressive presenta-
tion, organized and detailed budget, and in-
creased number of activities next year.

They already received an additional $1,500
from the ATC this year to help bring conserva-
tive speaker Dinesh D’ Souzaa few weeks ago.

Joseph Adams ’06, President of the College
Republicans, expressed appreciation for the
allocation but was also hoping to get the full
$2900 they had requested.

“We needed every dollar because we’ re more
active this year,” Adams said.“Still, the Col-
lege Republicans are up-and-coming and the
budget reflects that.”

The ATC gave the Young Democrats $365
out of their requested of $865. This allocation
reflects a 42 percent budget decrease.

McLean Quinn ’04, Co-President of the
Young Democrats, was also disappointed with
the outcome, but he still said, “[The Young
Democrats’ ] allocations have been sufficient
for providing the kinds of events and services
that our organization has hoped to achieve. The
fact is that our numerous activities this year
have not been costly.”

Matthews also said that these allocations are
not final. Organizations can request further
funds from the ATC reserve later in the year.

Matthews was elected in the Category II
elections as Vice-Chair of ATC last year and
automatically became ATC Chair this year
according to SGA by-laws.

The ATC consists of ten members: two
elected students (Vice Chair and Chair), five
students interviewed and selected by current
ATC members, SGA treasurer, one faculty rep-
resentative and the Coordinator of Student Ac-
tivities.

Talk on Korean nationalism to
cap off year-long lecture series

Funded by the Freeman Grant, series investigates rap-
idly expanding role of Asia in the world

By AMANDA STEPHENS
Senior Staff Writer

On Monday Dr. Charles Armstrong of Co-
Jumbia University delivered the final speech
ina speaker series hosted by Davidson’s Asian
Studies Program.

His lecture centered on the historical devel-
opment of Korean nationalism, and was fol-
lowed by a video showing of the Korean film
“2009: Lost Memories. ”

- Armstrong specializes in modern Korean,

East Asian, and international studies, and has_

published a book called The North Korean
Revolution, 1945-1950.

In an effort to bolster Asian Studies’ at
Davidson and to promote international aware-
ness, the Asian Studies Program has,brought a
total of four speakers over the course of the
year to Davidson.

Of the four speakers, two have spoken on
China, one on Japan, and one on Korea. Speak-
ers have addressed such topics as the national-
ism, nuclear issues, Asian identity, national se-
curity, and current East Asian concerns.

Following each speaker has been a film-
showing from the country of discussion.

Funded by the Asian Studies Program, the
speaker series has been made possible by pro-
ceeds from the Freeman Grant, which was
brought to Davidson by Dr. Shelly Rigger, head
of the Asian Studies Program.

Although Davidson currently does nothave
an Asian Studies major, the college does have
an East Asian Studies Concentration, which is
led by approximately ten professors from the
language, anthropology, history, and other de-
partments.

In particular, the speaker series has been a
corollary toaclass taught by Dr. Barak Kushner
called Asian Nationalism and Martial Arts
Films.

Kushner’s class has focused on the develop-
ment of the nation, culture, and state in three
Asian countries: China, Japan, and Korea, both
North and South.

Throughout the course, the class has watched
12 movies, four from each country. The objec-
tive has been to identify popular culture within
these movies and to distinguish between the
different countries.

Asia is considered one of the most rapidly
developing and influential regions of the world
today. Japan is the world’s second largest
economy and North Korea has taken a consid-
erably important role with respect to nuclear
issues.

Because the speaker series is open to the
public, Dr. Kushner views the series as an “edu-
cational outreach” that has the potential to in-
form the community about Asia and its grow-
ing importance in the national community.

Dr. Kushner is also hopeful that the speak-
ers will offer a deeper understanding of Asian
popular culture.

“2009: Lost Memories,” the film that fol-
lowed Dr. Armstrong’s talk, is a science fic-
tion movie that questions what the conse-
quences of Japanese colonialism would have
been, had it not ended in Korea.

The movie was a big blockbuster hit in Korea,
and sheds light on contemporary Korean cul-
ture.

The film also examined North-South Korean
relationships, and the history of Japanese co-
lonialism.
