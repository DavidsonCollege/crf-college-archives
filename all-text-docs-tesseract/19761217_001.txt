Young,Brown clinch top SGA posts

By LYMAN COLLINS
Assistant News Editor

By a margin of twenty-seven votes,
Thom Young narrowly defeated Ro-
ger Brown in the election for the office
of SGA President. In the Vice-Presi-
dential contest, Bruce Brown edged
by Guy DiCenzo with 495 votes to
DiCenzo’s 457.

“One of the first things I’m going
to do is sit down with (outoing SGA
President) Bo Baskin and all the
committee chairmen to see where
their committees stand,” said Young.
“I want to try to get them to complete
their projects and while we must
about this positively, some commit-
tees, might feel that their particular
committee needs to dissolve.”’

Young praised the work that Bas-
kin and the Senate have done up to
this time and indicated that he was
confident that their relationship will
continue on such a successful note.

“I want to stress the fact that I
want to have a very open Senate,”’ he
continued. ‘“‘Every student does not
have to have a title to do something
for Davidson College.”’

Young explained that one of his
initial programs will be to revitalize
and reorganize an Interorganizational

ee ae

Forum such as had been in effect here
in past years.

‘‘We need coordination. There’s a
lot going on here that is either
overlapping or merely an empty
space,’’ he emphasized. ‘‘Let’s get the
whole community in the SGA.”’

Incoming SGA Vice-President
Bruce Brown reiterated Young’s ideas
indicating that he would like to
involve himself in such a board. .

“There should be more involvement
with outside organizations including
the media,”’ he said.

Young also expressed a desire for

more coordination between the Senate
and The Davidsonian.

“T°: hope the relationship between
the Senate and The Davidsonian can
become closer so that the paper
reports the positive aspects of the
Senate and the SGA,”’ Young said.
“We can both benefit from reporting
everything that the SGA is doing.”’

Young expressed satisfaction with
the Senate visitation program. He
wants to examine and evaluate the
program but he basically thinks that
it is ‘‘a good program.”’

Brown indicated that he wants to

continue working closely with the
program. ‘‘I think that this is one
area that can be made more efficient,’’
he said. ‘‘We’re in the right direction
and the image of*the SGA has risen
since we began the program.”

Young wants to continue the work
begun on faculty evaluation. He
wants to have a course evaluation
handbook.

‘The reason it wasn't published
last year was because there wasn't
enough student input, only about 25
percent of the students responded,”’
he explained.

“Bo has suggested paying someone
to edit the evaluation handbook. |
certainly think that idea should be
explored because the idea of a
handbook is an excellent one,’’ he
added.

One of Brown's major jobs will be
to head the Residence Hall Hall
Council. He will concentrate mainly
on dorm improvements in this capa-
city.

“There’s a lot of improvement to be
made,” he said, ‘including off-cam-
pus expansion.”

Brown plans to explore the possi-
bility of increasing the number of
kitchens and lounges in dorms “‘de-
pending on the amount of space we
have. It would be the next logical
step,”’ he said.

Young expressed his appreciation
to all who helped him win the election
and emphasized that he wanted
people to feel free to drop suggestions

Landis edits paper

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Editor

The new editor of The Dav-
idsonian, selected Tuesday by
a vote of the SGA, is Cather-
ine Landis. Landis is a junior
from Chattanooga, Tennessee.
She is the first female to
occupy the office, a distinction
she says she is ‘‘proud’’ to
claim.

“T am very pleased but I do
not feel at an advantage or
disadvantage because I am a
woman. I can’t help but feel a
little proud about being a
first,’’ explained Landis.

Landis’ first action after her
election was to assign posi-
tions to Davidsonian staff
members. She announced that
Bill Barnett would continue as
Editorial Page Editor, a posi-
tion he has held for some
months. She also indicated
that Lyman Collins would be
switched to Sports Editor
from his current position as
Assistant News Editor.

Erica Gjersvik, a newcomer
to the paper’s staff, will be
made Features Editor.

Amanda Hall, who has ser-
ved for the whole year as

Managing Editor, according
to Landis.

Dave Keller, who narrowly
lost the election for editor to
Landis will serve The David-
sonian as its executive editor.
Landis announced the creation
of a new position as well, that

being Copy. Editor. Nancy
McNair will hold this position.

The business staff has been
re-shuffled too. Warren Soule
will assume the position of
Business Manager, while Kev-
in Shelly will become Adver-
tising Manager.

“Because I felt that: several
people on the staff deserved
the challenge of new posi-
tions,’’ said Landis, ‘‘I moved
the staff around. I also wanted
to channel potential talent
that I saw into new directions.

Banquet Hall renovation will yield
new art gallery /multipurpose room

By EMILY MASON
Staff Writer

The renovation of Chambers
Banquet Hall into a year-
round art gallery/multi-pur-
pose room, started three
weeks ago, is due to be

_ completed in mid-January.

The decision to provide
space for a ‘‘more or less
permanent gallery” was made
both because the Art Depart-
ment ‘“‘has been having quite a
few shows” and because ‘‘we
have a place for art where the
people are,”’ according to Gro-
ver Meetze, Director of the
Physical Plant and the man in
charge of the renovation pro-
ject.

The Banquet Hall was selec-
ted because it is the largest
available space in the most
active building on campus.
The end résult will represent
the combined effort of Grover
Meetze, his workers, and the
Art Department. ‘‘We worked
closely with the Art Depart-
ment which reviewed) all plans
on the project,’’ said Meetze.

A ‘‘flexible design’’ was
needed, since the room will be
used as an art gallery and a
dining area, as well as for
coffees and receptions. _

Major structural changes in
thé Hall include blocking the
use of the central doors behind
the stage, and closing one set
of windows on each side of the

Hall to allow room for large art

displays. The back of the Hall
is being converted into a
storage area for art and furni-
ture, and being equipped for
food preparation.

Meetze’s idea for construc-
ting triangular-shaped mov-
able display. columns will add
to the hanging space available
in the hall. These columns will
be stored in the back of the
Hall when not in use, and can
be rolled out onto the floor and
positioned to form small dis-
play ‘‘rooms”’ or partitions for
an art showing. The walls and
the columns will be covered
with plywood and vinyl] to
allow artwork to be hung.

The stage area will be

equipped with microphone
outlets and a-roll-away screen.

Speakers hung from ceiling
outlets will allow for a low-lev-
el, modulated voice to be
heard, with a minimum of echo
and reverberation throughout
the room, Overhead spot-
lights, in addition to the Hall's
central lighting, have been
installed to shine on the
movable display columns.

Furnishings in the Hall will
include metal benches, neu-
tral-colored upholstery mate-
rial and carpeting.

‘In-house planning and
work”’ have kept costs for the
renovation of the Banquet
Hall to a minimum, according
to Meetze. He feels that “the
Hall will create an atmosphere
that will help campus life a
lot. ©
