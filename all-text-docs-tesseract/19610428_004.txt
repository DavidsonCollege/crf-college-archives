The Perennial Clash:
Freshmen Vs. Sophs

Two fine examples of the continuing freshman-soph-

The Davidson “Trunk Trage-
dy" occurred in the 1890 and
was the result of a colossal
blunder on the part of some
obscure faculty member. The
story is particularly pertinent
amidst today’s student grumb-
lings about a crowded examina-
tion schedule.

It seems that some astute
faculty member had sat up- late
into the night figuring out a
Christmas examination which al-

they spirited the luggage to a

With this notice there will be

These letters concerning regis-

West has been teaching at
Davidson for the last six years
and has served as the leader of
the Piedmont Youth Orchestra.
While the exact future of the
orchestra without West is uncer-
tain, there is a possibility that
it will be sponsored by the Char-
lotte Symphony.

He will become associate pro-
fessor of music in the Conserva-
tory of Music at St. Andrews.
In a DAVIDSONIAN interview,
West said, “It will be a great
personal challenge to me to or-
ganize an instrumental program
at a new college with no tradi-
tion or previous standards.

Martin plans to revise some
of the traditional Davidson
cheers which distinguish it from
other colleges.

Next year the cheerleaders
will assume responsibility for
interest and attendance at all
sports events, giving more em-
phasis to minor sports.

“The worst stealing occurs
at chapel period, during drill,
and at mealtime,” Wellford
continued. Another member
of the court has said that
students can cut down on the
thefts by closing their. room
doors before drill, chapel per-
jods, and meals.

Lacy mentioned several in-
stances this year when students
waited a few days before re-
porting stolen property to the
court, therefore making it al-
most impossible to trace the
theft. Wellford urged students
to help the court enforce the
honor system by reporting all
stolen items immediately to
him.

In reference to the increase
in thefts during the past year
and especially those this week,
Wellford stressed that enforce-
ment of the honor system must
be a co-operative movement, for
no amount of Honor Court
sleuthing alone can eliminate
the present widespread stealing
on campus.
