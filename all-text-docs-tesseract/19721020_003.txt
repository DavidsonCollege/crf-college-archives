Bliss Returns With New Views On War

By BETSY ALEXANDER
Staff Writer

“I'm a pacifist, but if I had any
doubts about it before, the war
would have changed all that.

“You can't imagine what a
popular war is like. All the In-
dians were totally in favor of
the war. The Indians could do
no wrong and everything the
Pakistanis did was absolutely
wrong.”

Professor of English Frank
W. Bliss, Jr. returns to Davidson
after a year in India as in-
Structor in American and
English literature at the
University of Poona. Bliss went
with his family to India on a
Fulbright Scholarship, an ex-
change program sponsored by
the State Department for
students, researchers, and lec-
turers in an effort to promote
mutual understanding and

cultural exchange.

‘I applied for India because
of the South Asian Program
here and because I wanted a
year in a non western culture—
something entirely different
from what I'd been used to,”
said Bliss.

Bliss seemed full of memories
and warm feelings toward his
year in India, a year in which he
and his family experienced and
learned much about the Indian
people and their culture.

An extra added attraction

was provided by the War of
Bangladesh between India and
Pakistan.

Bliss was overwhelmed by
the popularity of the war. The
Pakistanis were intensely
disliked and the people of
Bangladesh intensely liked.
Many Indians worked for days
for nothing.

A military hospital located in
Poona gave a first-hand ac-
count of the role played by the
Indian soldiers or ‘‘jawans,”’ in
the war as thousands poured in-
to it.

“Everything was intensely
propagandistic and patriotic,”

Ro prennnnnan

said Bliss. ‘‘For days the
newspapers would run stories of
the wounded, telling of their
part in the battles.”

As to the more immediate ef-
fects of the war on Bliss and his
family, Bliss said, *“‘We had
black-outs every night for two
weeks. We had to put paper on
all the windows.

“The windows of buses were
painted black or covered with
paper and the cars had paper
covering the headlights,” he
said. It was bad enough driving
in India anyway, but to drive at
night without headlights!

“Our house was right bet-
ween the national defense
academy and the munitions
dump, which was a very un-
comfortable place to be,”’ he ad-

The difference between In-
dian and American standards of
sanitation was something to
which the Bliss family had to
adjust.

“I was told it would take six
months to get used to the sights,
sounds and smells of India. And
it did,”’ he said. ‘‘We had to boil
all our water for 20 minutes.

“One of the biggest treats for
the kids coming back through
Athens, was to be able to drink
right from the faucet. This was
unheard of in India,” Bliss said.

“All the vegetables had to be
soaked and then chemically
treated,”’ he said. ‘‘One of the
chief concerns among
Americans was _ infectious
hepatitis. We had to be very
careful."

The city of Poona has
1,300,000 inhabitants, small by
Indian standards. Within the
city were about 20-30 un-
dergraduate colleges. The
Poona University itself was a
graduate school.

The medium of instruction
was English, although the

majority of the people spoke
Marathi, in which Bliss was
tutored by his students. He
also delved into Hinduism.

“I was fascinated to have a
student say (when I mentioned
wanting to come back to India
some day) to go to a temple and
pray toa god,” he said. Because
Hinduism is polytheistic, they
pray to various gods.

The Indian students were ac-
customed to being ‘‘.ectured
at’’ and so they were very in-
terested in opportunities to ex-
press themselves.

“I also tried to learn their
names, which they were very
grateful for, because _in-
structors usually did not make
this effort,”’ he said.

‘‘What I would like to stress
most is the warmth and frien-
dliness of the Indian people. I
valued the whole experience,
and I think my family felt the
same way,'’ he said.

Dean of Students Will Terry
explained that the college pays
part of the freshmen
orientation fee to the eating
houses when they have activities
for the freshmen.

The first three days of Winter
Term will be Open House for
freshmen so that each fresh-

‘man can visit each house.

After the Open House period,
the freshmen can select two
houses that they want to visit
more.

They eat at these two houses
and participate in social func-
tions for one week at each
house.

Self selection will be held on
the first Thursday of the Spring
Term.

A committee selected by the
Patterson Court Council and
headed by Jerry Godbehere
drew up the program

“We are trving to find what is
best for the freshmen,” God-
behere said. *‘We want them to
get a better overall view of the
court.”

Emanon President Jim
Thompson said, “1 hope this
year that houses will take more
of the initiative in this program.
I think all of the houses are

willing to have the freshmen
assigned to them and involved
in their activities.”

Terry commented, ‘I think
that the whole situation will be
easier now that the freshmen
eat on the court anyway. The
secret to the system is always
the effort that the houses make
to make the freshmen feel that
they are wanted.

**We are acutely aware that
Patterson Court, by the very
nature of things. cannot provide
for the total social life of fresh-
men, so we are also en-
couraging freshmen halls and
dorms to plan their own parties.
mixers, etc. to go hand in glove
with the fine effort the frater-
nities are making.”

Freshmen Ed Bowen and Dan
Douglass said they think the
system is working well.
"Fraternities seem to be out to
impress you.” Bowen added,
“rather than you having to im-
press them.”

“The system's working well.”
Godbehere said. “but not as
well as we'd all like it to. It's
mainly a problem of
comunication between the
court, the freshmen and the
hall counselors; but I'm sure it
will be worked out soon.”’

for the deaf. It is a company of

deaf mutes that present theatre
for the people as_ en-
tertainment.”

“Gilgamesh” is a new ad-
dition to the company's reper-
toire this year. It is a classical
epic of Sumeria written 1500
years before Homer.

The presentation that will be
performed was adapted and
directed by one of the members
of the company. Action of the
play takes place in the Great
City of Uruk, The Plains, Moun-
tains and Forests of the An-
cient Near East, and the Un-
derworld.

“For centuries pantomime
has been a_ universal
language.’ commented Barber.
“They have added to mime,
music, narration and sign in
their presentation.”

Supported now in part by a
$150,000 a year grant from
HEW., The National Theatre of

the Deaf has had 10 national
tours, two Broadway runs, and
five Asian and European tours.

Each summer the Eugene
O'Neill Theatre Center conducts
a summer camp for deaf per-
sons in colleges, theatre groups,
and other walks of life. Besides
aiding and educating other deaf
actors, the summer school
provides a course for actors for
the tour.

The company has also made
TV appearances on the ‘“Today
Show" and ‘Sesame Street."
One of their cast members is
now a regular member of the
“Street.”

The Davidson performance
will be Thursday, Oct. 26 at 8:15
p.m. Student tickets will be
available free Monday thru
Wednesday at the Union Desk
and date tickets for $1. Student
tickets at the door Thursday
will be $2 and General Ad-
mission is $4.
