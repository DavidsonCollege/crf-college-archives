Chaplain

As a chaplain in the last World

up one man and carried him back

Dr. Lacy said that these decora-

tions were given to make these men

examples for~the soldiers. In the
same omanner Christians ‘should
serve as examples in living. Dr.

Lacy urged the students to follow
Christian life, because they will be
important in leading men to Christ.

I was struck by the wide variety

the questions asked on the sheet,

concerning any project that O.D.K.

might undertake to improve the

Some of them were really prac

as far as we could see, none of.
them were of such nature as to

make action on them by the, fra-

ternity plausible or even possible.
Some of the suggestions were al

organizations more apfropriate or
more carpable of carrying out the

work, but most of them, we are
