VICTORY ... The Davidson Wildcats played
top football against the State Wolfpack,
emerging victorious by a score of six to two.
The “Cats outplayed their scrappy opponents
at every turn throughout the entire game.
This was indeed a great day for Davidson, as
this marked the first victory over State by
the Wildcats in several years or any other
college in the Big Five with the exception”of
Wake Forest. Doe Newton’s tutelage proved

its worth against the heavily favored players

of Coach Hunk Anderson, former Notre Dame
coach, -

Navy defeated W. & M. in a hard fought
game only by a score of 18-6. The Wildcats
will travel up to Annapolis, where we pre-
dict another success for Davidson.

DANCING . Wake Forest students held a
meeting immediately after returning to col-

lege and unanimously voted to abolish dane-
ing om the campus after the trustees had
granted the privilege.

Action taken students of the Baptist
school to withdraw their petition for dancing
resulted from the general resentment of the
Baptist congregation all over the South. Sey-
eral professors had been instrumental in ob-
taining the dancing privilege, and direct ac-
tion was going to be taken against these in-
structors by the Baptist following if the stu-
dents had not acted as they did.

BASEBALL ... We are wondering where the
Davidson baseball teams will toss and knock
*em this year? The new stands on the east
side of Richardson Field will make it impos-
sible for games to be held on the old diamond.
Perhaps we will end up on the drill field where
the freshmen have practiced in the past; then
where the freshmen will go will be the next
question! —

In this editorial I’m not referring to any-

this year. On the whole the conduct in chapel
has been complementary, and such attention
and attitude has been appreciated. If I thought
such would continue of its own accord, I would

No matter what you may think of me, or the
other men who hold similar offices on the

responsibility of their positions.

As | mentioned beforehand, the ‘Student
Body’s attitude this year has been most re-
spectfuly I wonder, though, how true that
would be if a meeting of the Student Council
had been called in chapel. Judging from the
past attitude of the students on such an occa-
sion, and from fear that such disrespect would
continue, it has become necessary to have
that body meet unknown to the Student Body.
That to me is something we should all be
ashamed to admit in public. After the appear-
ance of this article and when the occasion
arises that a meeting of the Council is called
in chapel, I hope the Student Body/will have
an entirely different reaction from that which
it has shown in the past.

Perhaps you don’t think this matter of dis-
playing respect to your officers, speakers and
councilmen of any consequence. I feel, how-

Last Saturday was one of the best

Saturday night the grid-graph

POLITICAL CRAP GAME

ELECTIONS ARE NEAR

ROM until November, parties
and- candidates will spend millions of dollars and
countless convincing the American voting
for and why. Radios will be
filled with the din of some of the worst orator’ who
ever graced the country. Billboards will announce
and declarations.
NeWspapers will fill page after page with pictures,
speeches and statements of their particular candidate.
Newsreels will give theater patrons a chance to see
the aspirants. Magazines will carry
articles by famous journalists and officials. In short,
every devise known to modern-day living will be used
in an effort to tear down or build up a candidate.

To further baffle the voter, bosses will endeavor to

most reactionary organizations as a means of fright-

The wise voter will carefully study the important
factors involved in the campaign. He will determine
what periodicals represent what party and then con-

will recognize the accomplishments of the candidates

CALL US “GENTLEMEN”

GREETING ON THE CAMPUS

BYERY year it is necessary to remind the freshman

class that Davidson students speak, that they speak
cordially. We notice that this freshman class is com-
posed of men who do not spenk at all, men who nod
half-heartedly, and only a few

who really show the

spirit of Davidson friendliness.

We hope that it will not be necessary to call the
attention of the Student and the freshman
class to this subject again. Speak, freshmen. Use
the word “Gentlemen.” Is not such a custom as this

worthy of being continued ?

Led by their star halfback, Ted
Spurling, who broke away for re-
peated long runs, the Huntersville
eleven defeated a plucky but light
Davidson High School football
team, 12 to 0. The game was play-
ed on the freshman field, Friday,
September 24.

After being outplayed the first
half, the strong Huntersville eleven
started flicking and rolled up a
touchdown i in each of the last quar-
ters. The first followed a recovery
of a Davidson fumble by the visi-
tors. The second by a pass to Spur-
ling, who twisted his way through
the Davidson team for twenty yards
and a score.
