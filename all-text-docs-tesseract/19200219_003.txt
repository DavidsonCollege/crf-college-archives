| REV. S. H. HAY SPEAKS AT “Y”
SERVICE.

| Excellent Address on “The Founda-
| tion of a Man’s Life.”

Rev. S. H, Hay, of the class of 06,
addressed the “Y" Sunday night.
Mr. Hay has been the pastor of the
Mooresville Presbyterian Church
for several years. In spite of the
flue and the large number of men
off the hill, the attendance was the
largest this year. After the regular.
Service a song service was held, as
: there were no other religious ser-
vices during the day.

“The Foundation of a Man’s Life”
was the subject of the address. The
text was taken from Isaiah: “Be-
hold, 1 have laid in Zion a stone, a
sure foundation.” The ideal for
which a man starts out in life has
[everything to do with his success.

The speaker took up the different | .
passions which actuate men’s lives, sealed
beginning with the lower and going package

up to the highest.

Idleness and the desire fur ease:
wreck many lives. They do not,’
however, affect college graduates -
‘often. Greed is a far more common
and alluring goal. While thrift and
the desire to gain are perfectly
legitimate, they are dangerous and!
‘unsatisfying ambitions. Many men
are swayed by the lure of position or |
power. Others, of higher ideals.
strive for personal excellence or
| Obedience to duty. It is, indeed noble ,
'to be one to whom o-u-g-h-t spells
'm-ues-t. Next to the highest ambi-'
_tion of all is service, Christ thunder-
jed out the call to service nineteen
jcenturies ago, and the present gen-
eration has seen the world respond
to that call. But man can strive to
.serve humanity and yet Jack the
greatest and deepest motive power
of all—the striving after a Christ-
like life. Every man should ask.
“Christ to his Savior, should try to
‘be like Him, and bring his will to!
Him. The only way to do the will)
of God is to ask incessantly what
His will is, in every action of one's .
life. The only sure foundation for
mgnkind is Christ. |

|_QUARANTINE AGAIN PRE- |
VENTS BIBLE CLASSES AND
SUNDAY SCHOOLS.

While the “flu” epedimic is a
thing of the past as far as Davidson,
College is concerned, yet Dr. Mac- |
Connell thought it best to maintain
the quarantine regarding church.
Due to this fact also the Bible
Classes and Sunday Schools were
not held.

lt is hoped that by next Sunday
conditions will permit the resuming.
of the customary Sunday activities.

When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust
Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to
“go to it." We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
his sttong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good.
Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.
