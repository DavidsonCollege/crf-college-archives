Religion and war confuse
the Arab-Israeli conflict

By RAMI EL AMINE

Prior to Spring Break, Fuad
Bahnan, a presbyterian minis-
ter born in Jerusalem, spoke at
Davidson about the “miscon-
ceived” Arab-Israeli conflict.
According to Bahnan, “Chris-
tians have too. often allowed
the problems in Palestine to be
overlooked because of the in-
volvement of Muslims.” He
went on to stress that “The
question of justice and human
dignity is the paramount is-
sue,...as Christians we need a
new perspective,”

Beginning with a theological
view of the dilemma, Bahnan
went on to shed light on these
poe pistorys ye violet

Theologically speaking,
Bahnan said, “the kingdom of
God does not involve a politi-
cal institution,” referring to
Abraham’s promise to the Jews
that the kingdom of God was
their’s and that they would be

led once again to their home- .

land. Bahnancontinued, “even
though the Jewish people were
promised a homeland, it was

done so by an all inclusive, not -

exclusive God...so howisit that
the Palestinians have been ex-
cluded?”

_ Bahnan reiterated. the need

_ to regain a historical perspec-
tive “inorder to undo the stere-
otypeimagesand myths which
have been woven into the fab-
ric” further clouding: the pres-
ent situation.

History takes us back to
World War I when the British
made an agreement with Shar-
iff Hussein, a spokesman for
the Arab people who were, at

that time, under the rule of the»

Turks, to rebel against them

and in return the British would
grant them sovereignty.
At the same time the British

madea secret treaty, the Sykes- _ |
Picot Treaty, with France. - |

Under it the British and French
agreed to partition Arab pos-
sessions between them upon
the defeat of the Turks.

In 1917, the Balfour declara-
tion gave Jews the right to
emigrate to the Holy Lands as
long as they did not exceed set
quotas, and more importantly,
as long asitdid “not jeopardize
the rights of the non-Jewish
community in Palestine and
the world at large,” Saed

‘ Bahran.

At ot time there were

ae without political inclina-

‘tions, said Bahnan. By 1947

there were 700,000 fully armed
and trained Jews whose main
purpose was political.

In 1948 the Palestinian Arab
State never came into existence
and the Palestinian people
went into diaspora. Bahnan
ended by saying, “Now there
are four and a half million Pal-
estinians in the world...no
homeland...and no identity.”

Concerning Islam, Bahnan
said “You can never under-

stand the psyche of the people

unless you understand Islam.”
Bahnan discussed the five pil-
lars of Islam in a way under-
standable to Christians. .

He compared the first pillar,
which is the declaration of the
faith, to the Mycanean Creed.
Then he challenged any Chris-
tianto uphold the second pillar
which is prayer five times a
day, beginning at sunrise. A
pilgrimage to the Kaaba in the
holy city of Mecca is the third
pillar.

Although humanity cannot
cure the common cold, she can
technologize it. If the illness is
not serious, the humans sniffle
while the computer coughs
“Vote for Dukakis” on the
screen. -If the sickness grows
worse, chills and fevers attack
the human body while mock
files start replacing (effectively
erasing) the information on the
computer's hard drive. Vi-
ruses in humans and comput-
ers waste your time and make
your life miserable.

In a computer a virus is basi-
cally a self-reproducing pro-
gram (it is contagious) that
implants a specific symptom
designed by a programmer.
Although the intention of this
symptom may be harmless, all
viruses use memory and often
implement unintended side-
effects, ranging from stalling
print jobs to crashing the sys-
tem, and all computers are

susceptible to some form of
viruses.

In most cases, viruses origi-
nate and spread through the
copying of public domain soft-
ware or the unauthorized re-
production of copyright pro-
grams. Once the virus infects a
computer, any disk not write-
protected which is inserted in
the contaminated machine
may contract the virus. There-
fore, in public access labs, like
the Computer Center, one in-
fected disk canspread the virus
to ev@y disk used. in the con-
taminated computerand every
computer using the contami-
nated disk.

The only CSC computers that
have been infected with a virus
are the Macintoshes. Students
are advised to have a student
assistant check their disks for
viruses if they have used a Mac
in the past month. The virus is
not serious and will not erase
your documents, but it does

To read about protecting
one’s computer from viruses,
students should pick up acopy
of anti-virus programs from
the Computer Center. They are
public domain and free of in-
fections. Althoughat Davidson
the viruses have been limited
to Macintoshes, the Computer
Center has anti-virus pro-
grams for IBM users. These
programs will not correct all
viruses since viruses mutate
and new ones pop up fre-
quently. However, they will
correct all known viruses (as of
February 1990).Students
should also be wary of public
domain software by checking
them with the anti-virus pro-
grams. Duplicating copyright
software isillegal. Finally, keep
all master diskettes write-pro-
tected; this precaution will
ensure backups in case your
current programs become in-
fected and fail.

Bahnan reminded the audi-
ence that it was Abraham, be-
lieved to be the first of the line
of Muslim Prophets extending
through Jesus and ending with
Mohammed, who built the
Kaaba and, therefore, he
should not be reserved exclu-
sively to the Judeo-Christian
tradition.

Fasting for the entire holy

Ramadan _ is the

rorism, Bahnan told the audi-
ence, “The American press has
done a great job of reporting
when?, how?, where?, and
what? when terrorist acts oc-
cur, but they never report
why?”

Terrorism is “a symptomofa
deeper ailment...it is the cry of
the powerless against the pow-
erful,” he stated.
Consequently, he continued,

1947 the figure was much
larger.

“How do we speak about
love to our Jewish friends?”
With the wounds of the Holo-
caust not yet healed the Jewish
people still feel threatened and
insecure, Bahnan conceded.
That is why we have to reach
out to them with love because

out that fasting did not simply
entail giving up one’s greatest
desire, but not eating or drink-
ing (or smoking) from dusk to
dawn. The fifth pillar is the
giving of alms from a percent-
age of one’s income.

A final point Bahnan made
concerning Islam was’ to clear
up the myths associated with
Islamic jihad, or holy war. “To
Muslims,” said Bahnan, “all
wars are holy since there is no
separation between Church
and State.” War is divided into
small and larger wars. The
small war takes place outside
of persons. The larger, on the
other hand, is within; it is a
battle which involves faith. ©

To clear up any remaining
doubts about the concept of

holy war, Bahnan quotes from |

the Koran (holy scriptures as
revealed to Mohammed by the
Angel Gabriel): “Do not carry
arms, for God does not like
aggressors.”

Concerning violence and ter-
