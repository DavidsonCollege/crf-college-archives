Residence Life Office Maintains Busy Schedule in Spring

By Curt Bickers

Richard Terry combats the
constant threat of students vandal-
izing dorm property and other stu-
dents’ property. At the same time,
he deals with students who feel
they need to be the exception to
every rule. “Some students are
simply inconsiderate of others,”
Terry said.

Several common issues dis-
cussed that face the Residence Life
Office yearly were the lottery, the
Resident Advisor applications,
Senior Apartments and other dorm
renovations and security.

Lottery brochuresare to be sent
out the first week in March. While
the system is essentially the same,
one major clement will be updated.
The old way of students coming by
the RLO and drawing a lottery
number needlessly immobilizes the
RLO for three days. Under the
revised system, a computer will
generate a randomly assigned
number to each student. One thing
students need to be aware of is

what their class standing will be
for the following year. If a student
needs one more credit, which the
student will take over the summer
in order for that student to move
from sophomore to junior stand-
ing, then the student needs to alert
the Registrar. Otherwise the auto-
mated lottery system will simply
assign numbers according to Reg:
istrar records.

The only housing problem
foreseeable will be the number of
students allowed off campus.
Yearly, due to finances, the RLO
must maintain an average of 90-95
percentof the total student body on
campus. Of course, 100-125 stu-
dents must live off campus be-
cause the college cannot meet 100
percent of the student body in
occupancy. March 2 marks the
date on which students may begin
to submit off-campus housing ap-
plications. Asarule, rising Sopho-
mores may not submit applications
until after lottery.

Another factor of lottery con-

cerns the Senior Apartments. The
way Residence Life used to handle
Senior Apartments was to assign,
based on class ratio, a certain
number of apartments for males
and for females. Last year, how-
ever, the number of rising senior
males who sought apartments was
far less than the number of female
seniors wishing to acquire apart-
ments. Therefore, the system now
uses an engendered, by-number-
only issuance of Senior Apart-
ments. There are approximately
248 beds available in Martin Court.
No mixed groups (those with a
junior) are given better lottery
numbers than complete senior
groups seeking apartments.

Students need to be aware that
bills for room deposits will be is-
sued to parents on March 1. The
deadline for RLO to receive the
deposits is March 23. A student
may not go through lottery without
Davidson College having received
that student’s deposit.

Building improvements the

’ RLO projects for summer, 1992,

will not be as extensive as those of
last summer. Residence Life is
planning on closing Richardson,
Watts and Little for renovation.
Improvements will include re-
painting, fixing the ceilings, reno-
vating the heating and air-condi-
tioning systems, and redecorating
the lounges. In addition, it has
been proposed to expand the elec-
tronic key-entry system in dormi-
tories. Either all of the up-the-hill
dorms will receive the new locks,
or all of the down-the-hill dorms
will be re-done with this system.
In addition to the electronic
key-entry system, added security
measures are being taken in the
dorms. Students may have noticed
window stops on some windows in
their dorm. These are to keep
people from entering dorms who
should otherwise not be in the
dorms. Also, dead-bolting Senior
Apartments are not feasible be-
cause the locks would require keys

This would increase opportunity
for theft of keys and then the un-
authorized entry into apartments
by individuals who should not be
there. The dead-bolts are also very
expensive.

Any further suggestions about
security are welcome by the RLO
if students have them.

Recently, the RLO made
Senior Apartment. inspéctions
which raised many harsh feelings.
Some students felt they were being
patronized in regards to their treat-
ment of the apartments. If care,
however, is not maintained by stu-
dents, money whichcould be used
for financing greater security
measureswill be used security , to
help maintain the buildings. Resi-
dent Life’s chief goal is to insure
that students live in the utmost
comfort while attending Davidson
College.

tional supplements or grants. If this foreign aid were even conditioned,
she emphasized, the maintenance of this sort of occupation would be
impossible. Similarly, to loan Israel an additional $10 billion for the
settlement if Soviet Jewish immigrants would not only be risking a:
default on the loan, according to Butterfield, but would simply contribute
directly to the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
where Israel plans to relocate another half a million of these settlers in g

the next year.

“The entire occupation is contrary to international law,” Butterfield

stated in mid-conclusion. By continuing to ladle out billions to support %

Israel, she reiterated, not only does the U.S. oppose any advancements f

of peace and human rights in the Middle East, but it neglects the three

million homeless and the domestic dilemma our own country faces. \
“Certainly,” Butterfield concluded, “a reworking of priorities is

called for.”

Fraternities

since they did not have to undertake the huge expenses of constructing
their own houses. Today, that area is known as Jackson Court.

So the social system continued to grow. On the eve of World War
II, the fraternities seemed to be at their height, with almost every single
group thriving and more being added. Phi Delta Thetachartered in 1928,
and Sigma Phi Epsilon came in 1930, each merging with a local group.
The social scene, certainly bolstered by the automobile, became fantas-
tic as the houses held dances and banquets frequently, decorated for
Homecoming, and kept a healthy rivalry for the scholarship cups and .
athletic titles. With a friendly and supportive administration, a great
social life, and the reputation of “the campus of gentlemen,” nothing {
could go astray. Only the most perceptive and wisest would have seen
the changes in values and ideas that would pervaded the 30 years after
the war and change, forever, the face of fraternities at Davidson and

across the nation.
