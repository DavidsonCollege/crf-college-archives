New coach,

It is early September, which means two-a-
days and inter-squad scrimmages have come
and gone. With every team in the nation
working towards a championship, the 2005
Wildcats are no different.

New coach Tripp Merritt has had the ’Cats
here since August 9 in search of their first
Pioneer Football League championship.

With the season opener just three days
away, let’s take a closer look at our 2005
Cats.

Latting ‘06 returns to the pitch as member of pre-season All-SoCon Team.

“We definitely have the
tools and the weapons to
be dangerous, but it all
comes down to how we

execute on Saturdays.”
--Jonathan Hubbard ’07

This season’s team will look quite differ-
ent than the team .Mike Toop left after his
fourth season at Davidson. The new system
being installed by Merritt and his assistants
looks to return the ’Cats to their winning

ways.

After two struggling years, Merritt, a for-
mer assistant at Davidson from 1993-1999,
has the boys fired up.

“Coach Merritt brings a whole new atti-
tude and philosophy toward the game. His
enthusiasm is contagious, while his work
ethic and dedication are unparallel,” said co-
captain Alex Arinsmier ’06.

Arinsmier joins Ricky Childers 06 and
Jonathan Hubbard ’07 as tricaptains for the
2005 season.

Arinsmier and Childers are looking to
anchor the defensive unit this season.
Davidson will continue to run some of their
schemes from last season with personnel that
have experience within the system.

The ’Cats D will face the challenge of
replacing all-PFL players Brendan Dete,
Kevin Saunders, and Chris Leftwich. The
loss of those three seniors to graduation will
hurt, but the focus is on the now. Several
players who held reserve roles in the past
will be thrust into starting positions and are
welcoming the opportunity to make an
impact.

The offense faces the biggest challenge,
replacing all-time Davidson leading rusher
John Leverett ‘05.

The absence of Leverett opened the door
for Hubbard to pick up the work load.

Player of the Week

Kara Koehrn ‘06

Soccer

Hometown: La Mesa, California

Major: Biology

Koehrn led the women’s soccer team to a 2-1 victory. in their
season opener. The senior captain first assisted her sister,
Kristin ‘07, and then scored herown goal to break the 1-1 tie
and give the ‘Cats the win. Koehrn was also chosen last

week to the preseason All-SoCon Team.

Preseason win gives
men’s soccer a boost

In their last tune-up for what is expected to
be a very strong season, men’s soccer took to
the field for a final exhibition game, looking
to repay Liberty for an earlier preseason loss.

The ’Cats squad, hoping to excede their
No. 2 SoCon preseason ranking, struck early
and often, taking a quick 2-0 lead over
Liberty, controlling the tempo and the ball
for most of the first half.

Co-captain John Latting ’06, recently
named to the preseason All-Conference
Team, drew first blood as he notched a goal
early in the game off a header from Cass
Baltz ’07.

Later in the half, Tom Lavan ’08 found the
back of the net, and that was all the scoring
Davidson needed, as they defeated Liberty 2-
1.

“The Liberty game was a good test, as we
lost to them last year in the preseason,” said
coach Matthew Spear.

“We played with confidence and attacked
very well. It was unfortunate to not score
some more goals as we generated some
excellent opportunities.” .

Spear was quick to note that many oppor-
tunities, such as strong efforts by co-captain

Wildcat fans hope
Hubbard’s combina-
tion of strength and
speed will lead to
the level of success
that Leverett experi-
enced.

The offense will
not just rely on the
run. The air attack
will continue to be a
threat on every play.
With multiple
weapons, execution
will be the key to
offensive success.

“We definitely
have the tools and
the weapons to be
dangerous, but it all
comes down to how
we execute on
Saturdays,” said
Hubbard.

This execution
will be in for a huge
test this Saturday
when the ’Cats trav-

David Sartorio ’07 and Whitey Bolan ’09,
took unlucky bounces or rang off the cross-
bar.

After the strong outing, the team and th
coach look forward to a very big season.

“We’ve got a great group of experienced
guys,” said netminder Jordan Hauser ’06,
applauding the often dominant effort of the
veteran squad members.

“We controlled the ball for most of the
game, and let up one week goal late in the
game. In reality, it felt more like a 6-1 win,”
he added.

Coach Spear agreed and is eager to
express his pleasure with his squad.

“What is exciting about this fall is our
seven seniors. They have pushed Davidson
Soccer to a new level as we look for our sixth
consecutive winning season and_ third
straight Conference Championship appear-
ance,” he said.

Davidson takes to Alumni field this
Friday, with their home opener against
crosstown rivals UNC-Charlotte..

“Charlotte is a massive game. We want a
lot of support to get the season starting off
with a bang. The student body needs to be
our ‘12th Man’,” said Spear.

The Wildcat squad takes the field at 7p.m.
Friday, at Alumni Stadium.
