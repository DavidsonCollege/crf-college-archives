Winters named Preseason Player of the Year

By WILL BRYAN
Staff Writer

Last season, the men’s basketball team
defeated Missouri on the road in the first
game of the season. They went undefeated in
the Southern Conference, being one of only
two teams in the country to accomplish that
feat. They won two games in the National

Invitational Tournament and had ACC-foe-

Maryland tied at the half before losing. This
year, they return seven seniors, three starters,
and the Southern Conference Player of the
Year, Brendan Winters ’06. No pressure.

A program that is used to playing against
bigger schools, the men’s basketball team
will take on one of their toughest schedules
in recent years at a time when the expecta-
tions couldn’t be higher. They open the sea-
son against AP Preseason top-ranked Duke
and go on to play road games against
Charlotte, Syracuse, and the defending
National Champion North Carolina Tar
Heels.

This team, however, does not look at the
hype or expectations and seems to have a
keen ability to focus on the task at hand.

“When it comes to expectations,” said
coach Bob McKillop, “we simply focus on
getting better and playing to the best of our
ability.” McKillop’s attitude is imparted to
his players every day at practice as they are
always reminded to focus on the details and
to play tough.

While this Wildcat team certainly seems
excited to be a given an opportunity to upset
some high-major programs, they will have to
do it without Logan Kosmalski ’05 and
Conor Grace ’05, two big men who were
integral to the ’Cats success last year. Ian
Johnson ’06, who averaged 11.1 points per
game last season, will look to start in the
depleted frontcourt at center, while Thomas
Sander ’08 and Boris Meno ’08 should also
see more playing time this year as they com-
pete for the fifth starting spot. It seems that
the majority of leadership will fall on the
senior backcourt made up of Kenny Grant
’06, who ranked 23rd in the nation in assists

_ last year, Matt McKillop ’06, fifth in all-time

Davidson history for three-pointers made,
and Winters, the unanimous preseason selec-
een for Player of the Year jn the Southern
Conference, averaging 16.7 points per game
last season.

Off the bench, Jason Morton ’06, who
averaged 10.4 points per game and hit 63
three-pointers last year, will see extensive
playing time along with Eric Blancett ’06, a
fifth-year senior whose experience and work
ethic add another element to an already deep
backcourt. Jason Richards ’08, who saw
increasing minutes near the end of Jast sea-
son will continue to back up Grant at the
point guard position.

The Wildcats also welcome four new
freshman to an already deep squad. Max
Gosselin ’09, Can Civi ’09, Andrew
Lovedale ’09, and Steve Rossiter ’09 will
surely add strength during practices and will
look to improve their understanding of the
Davidson system throughout the season.

In a meeting of Southern Conference
coaches and media members last month,
Davidson was ranked No. 1 in both the
coaches and media polls with near unanimi-
ty in first place votes by the coaches. Last
season, Davidson won the regular season
conference championship before being
defeated by the Spartans of UNC-
Greensboro in the Southern Conference tour-
nament semifinals.

Despite being invited to the NIT tourna-
ment, the Davidson faithful were disappoint-
ed that their team was not able to dance in
the NCAA tournament.

“After that loss [to UNC-G] we were all
heartbroken,” said Winters. “But we came in
and I think the coaches did a real good job of
getting our focus back and getting us ready
to go for the NIT.” Davidson went on to
defeat VCU and Southwest Missouri as they
advanced to the second round of the NIT
tournament before losing to Maryland.

Throughout the season last year, Davidson
shooters had a sharp eye from behind the arc,
allowing many observers to remark that the
Wildcats were merely a three-point shooting

’Cats finish with mixed
results at CAA Pod meet

The men’s and women’s swimming teams
were both in action this past weekend when
they hosted the CAA Pod meet
in Cannon Natatorium. The
two-day meet consisted of
teams from the College of
Charleston, Drexel, and
George Mason.

The men finished with a 2-1
record with head-to-head vic-
tories over the College of
Charleston and Drexel while
losing to George Mason. The
women finished with a 1-2
record defeating Drexel but
falling to George Mason and
Charleston.

For the men, Davidson start-
ed the meet on Friday after-
noon with a victory in the 200 free relay with
a time of 1:28.95 behind the strong strokes of
Brad Poole ’06, Jon Smith ’08, Miguel
Rodriguez °09, and Fiete Stegger ’08.
Stegger would go on to win the 100 free and
200 IM in Saturday’s competition. Poole
also picked up a victory on Saturday as he
won the 100 meter butterfly with a time of
52.75. The trio of Poole, Smith, and Stegger
then added Andrew Carlson -09 to their
ranks to pick up a victory in the 400 meter
free-style relay.

The men also got on the board in the div-

Hollar ’06 won two events
over the weekend.

ing events when Dwight Swift ’08 scored
well enough to pick up a sixth-place finish

on the one meter board. All of these perform- -

ances, including strong days by Robb
Broughton ’08 and Will Broughton ’08, led
the Wildcats to their 2-1
record.

On the women’s side,
Alanna Ream ’09 and Elli
Trefzger ’07 took first and
second place, respectively,
in the mile freestyle on
Friday, while co-captain
Megan Hollar ’06 won the
100 meter breaststroke in
1:06.37.

The Wildcats finished out
the day with a victory in the
400 medley relay in which
Hollar, Paige Tindall ’09,
Courtney Sanders ’09, and
co-captain Kristen Shields
’06 turned in a winning time of 4:01.69.
Hollar continued her winning ways on
Saturday when she picked up victories in the
200 breaststroke and 200 IM.

.“I was really pleased with the way we per-
formed this weekend,” coach Tim Kelly said.
“We raced really well, and I like the fact that
we stood up and got after it. We’ve made a
big jump over the last couple of weeks.”

The Wildcats will look to continue their
success in two weeks as they race again on
the Davidson campus on the weekend of
November 18-20.

team. Insiders, howev-
er, would be quick to
point out that
McKillop’s system con-
sists of a tough inside
game that relies on

physical play, crisp
screens, and _ strong
rebounding. The

Wildcats have such a
diversity of talent that
they can score from
nearly anywhere on the
court and can either
play transition or half-
court offense, depend-
ing on their opponent’s
weaknesses. In that
light, Davidson does not
“live or die” by the
three-point shot but can
stay in the game no mat-
ter if the shots are
falling or not.

The Wildcats played
their first scheduled
game in an exhibition
contest against the
Canadian team
Concordia. The ’Cats
came out victorious by a
margin of 93-67. Both
Meno and_ Johnson
recorded double-dou-
bles as Johnson scored
14 points and came down with 13 rebounds.
Meno also had 13 boards to go along with 13
points and five blocks.

It was Winters, however, who provided the
spark that put the Wildcats ahead in the sec-
ond half. After only leading by nine at half-
time, Winters scored 11 points in a three and

Johnson ’06 had 14 points and 13

fp

rebounds in the

a half minute stretch in the beginning of the
second half that put the Wildcats ahead for
good.

This year, every Southern Conference
team will be looking to knock the Wildcats
off. It seems like everyone in the town of
Davidson is expecting nothing less than a
NCAA tournament berth, No pressure.
