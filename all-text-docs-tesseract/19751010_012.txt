Biggest thing since Beatles

The Rollers excite fans to mass hysteria

By JOHN KIRK
Staff Writer

For my subject this week I have
chosen another aspect of British
culture (or perhaps, more correctly,
sub-culture) which I would sooner
have forgotten all about but which
has pursued me across the Atlantic. I
am referring to those five lovable lads
from Edinburgh, Scotland, who revel
in the collective name of the Bay City
Rollers, and who will have made their
debut on American T.V. by the time
you read this.

Rollers unfortunately talked of as
biggest thing since Beatles.

Now while no self-respecting liberal
arts student shoud have more than a
passing interest in the Rollers, they
are being talked of as the biggest
thing since the Beatles, which means
that their success does warrant some
investigation. ‘“‘Time’’ has already
run a feature on the group, but it
wasn’t done nearly scathing enough-
so in true tradition of no holds barred
journalism I hereby present you with
the definitive account.

I would like to think that the
success which the Rollers are curren-
tly enjoying will be strictly temporary
(the affections of pre-pubescent fe-
males being notoriously fickle) but at
the same time I have to acknowledge
that the necessary pre-requisites for
success on the scale of that achieved
by Liverpool’s Fab Four seem to be
present (what I am of course trying to
say is that they too can make little
girls wet themselves.)

Rollers gentle when compared to
provocative musicians.

_ For one thing, there is a uniform
which is very easily imitated by any
resourceful ten year old-this usually
consists of blue jeans cut off halfway
to the knee and trimmed with tartan
and denim jackets which are also

trimmed with tartan. As an optional
extra the well-dressed Rollers fan will
wear tartan scarves tied around the
wrist.

As far as. sartorial elegance is
concerned, this costume falls well
short of those collarless suits in which
Brian Epstein dressed his proteges,
but it serves its purpose. It has been
pointed out that the Rollers’ uniform
is a pretty fair approximation of that
sported by Manchester United Foot-
ball Clubs legendary Stretford Enders
(a group of several hundred young
men who have forged new paths in
soccer hooliganism-and who, while
they may not actually eat their
victims, will certainly consider just
about anything else.)

It would seem that it is not just
clothes that the Rollers have in
common with the aforementioned
louts -.lead singer Les McKeown
currently faces a charge of criminal
assault for clubbing a photographer
with a microphone stand during a
concert at Oxford this summer.

““Rollermania’’-a carefully engineered
product from the start:

As one has come to expect from the
music business, the name of the game
is manipulation-a process which oper-
ates on several fronts. Firstly, the
whole phenomenon of Rollermania
has been very carefully engineered
from the start.

Without wanting to incur the wrath
of the average Rollers fan, there
seems to have been more than an
element of telling the kids what they
want-or rather suggesting it to them
very strongly. The British media, and

particularly the diabolical radio ser-.

vice, over which that venerable
institution the B.B.C.
strangle hold, is relatively easy to put
to your own purposes if you have a
saleable commodity and enough cap-
ital.

The group themselves are amiable
dummies whose every public action is

exerts a.

carefully vetted by their manager,
Tam Paton, a singularly abrasive
gentleman who recently became most
upset with the New Musical Express
for daring to suggest that perhaps his
‘boys’ were not getting a fair deal.
But despite his protestations, it is by
now fairly clear that the Rollers are
product and also that they probably
need to have everything done for
them.

Rollermania differs significantly from
Beatlemania.

The astute reader will perhaps by
now have perceived a certain...shall
we say ‘bias’ on my part. I am
perfectly aware that the elements I
have cited here were also present in
the Beatlemania of the sixties-and
while I may appear very bigoted (as
indeed I am), there is one very
significant difference between the two
groups which I feel justifies my
unsympathetic response to ‘the ne
Beatles.’ “J

Rollers laughable as musicians,
produce sound, not music.

In the case of the Rollers, the music
(remember music?) seems to have
been forgotten. (Although, as an
aside, it is worth pointing out that
the music is very much dispensible
when it comes to making money-what
is on sale is a sound-and that sound
need not necessarily be a musical
one.)

While the Rollers may (heavens
forfend) conceivably achieve a level of
commercial su on a par with that
of the Beatles, any claim that they
should be accepted as musicians is
laughable.

Musical proficiency difficult to

discern.

It is a matter of some contention as
to exactly how musically competent
the Rollers are. The British. public
were shocked this summer to hear
that the Rollers used session musi-
cians on their records (surprise,

surprise). The test of live performance

has proved altogether meaningless in
that at a Bay City Rollers concert you
would be doing well to even discern
which number the group is playing,
such is the volume of the screaming.
But the question of musical profi-
ciency is of academic interest only,
since the Rollers’ music is mediocre in
the extreme-and is best described as
tired out beach music (try imagining
the Four Seasons on downers).

Rollers will never be comparable to
Beatles due to lack of “Timeless
appeal.”

The peculiar lethargy of the music
cannot however be attributed to
“consciousness expanding agents,”
since in keeping with ‘their clean-cut
boy next-door image the boys claim
that the strongest thing they touch is
milk. Stimulants aside, the Rollers
will never be able to compare with the
Beatles on a musical level, since
cliched as it may sound, it is
nevertheless true that the Beatles’
songs have an appeal which is
genuinely timeless.

Rollers will become next Beatles by
default, not genuine merit.

To finish, as I began, on a note of
condescension, I find myself at off
unguarded moments feeling a tinge of
sympathy for the generation which
has been consumes by Rollermania. I
acknowledge the varied audience to
which the Rollers appeal-from the five
and six year-olds (the lyrics pose no
real problems to the cognitive facul-
ties of the average child of this
age-group) to the thirteen year-olds
who have become disillusioned whith —
David Cassidy and are seeking some- —
thing a little more sophisticated, I
realise how much they love the
Rollers. It just seems such a pity that
if the Rollers are going to become the
new Beatles then they will do so, as it

were, by default and not by genuine
merit. ;
