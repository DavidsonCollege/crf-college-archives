BOONE—For almost seven minutes
Saturday, the Appalachian State fans waited
for their Mountaineers to make their first
basket of the game.

Then, ‘after App’s Rufus Leach landed a

three-pointer at the
9 13:11 mark, the
Mountaineer Mani-
acs waited for their
team to take the lead.

And they waited...and waited some
more.

But an overwhelming defensive effort
by the Wildcats never allowed the Mountain-
eers to satisfy their fans as Davidson defeated
conference leader Appalachian State 69-54
at Varsity Gym Saturday, snapping App’s
17-game home winning streak.

The closest Appalachian State came to
leading the game was a 38-38 tie midway
through the second half, but the Wildcats
promptly squashed the threat with a 17-3 run
over the next five minutes.

“We answered every run,” coach Bob
McKillop said. “And we answered every run
with great decision making. The poise in the
half court was as good as you could get.”

At the helm in the half court for much of
the game was Michael Bree, who turned in
one of the most impressive performances of
his career. Bree scored nine points, grabbed
acareer-high | 1 rebounds, and dished out six
assists.

But the stats don’t say enough about the
intangibles Bree brought'to the game.

“He's skilled and talented,” said
McKillop. “But superceding all of that skill
and talent is the heart and courage of a lion.”

A quiet yet confident control of the Wild-
cats’ offense has begun to emerge in Bree,
whose early-season inconsistency has disap-
peared in the homestretch of the 1999-2000
season.

“Tm trying to take an extra second with
the ball to find the good pass,” Bree said.
“Earlier in the year I was sort of tentative, but
now I feel much more confident.”

Two early steals by Bree helped set the
pace for the Wildcat defense, which attacked
the ball relentlessly all afternoon.

Appalachian State wasn’t able to get off
a decent shot much of the day thanks to the
smothering man defense that hounded the
Mountaineer shooters. The Wildcat’s out-
stretched arms and sheer size prevented the
Mountaineers from taking clean shots.

But not that
App State didn’ttry.

Of the Moun-
taineers’ 27 first-
half shots, only five
found the basket.

App State ©
never threatened -
during the first
twenty minutes as
Davidson led by as
much as 12 at one
point and went into
halftime enjoying a
30-21 advantage.

“We talked at
halftime about how
vital it was in those
first four or five min-
utes [of the second
half] notto get intoa
situation where they
could get a run on
us,” said McKillop,
responding — the
Mountaineers’ 17-6
run that opened that
second period.

But the Wild-
cats had dominated
for too long to let
this one slip away.

Wayne Ber-
nard broke the 38-
38 tie at the 12:27
mark with a short
jumper, sparking
the 17-pointrun that
would put the game
out of reach for the
Mountaineers, who could have clinched the
North Division regular season title with a
win.

“We've lost our edge,” admitted Appa-
lachian State coach Buzz Peterson.

Trying to bounce back from a shocking
loss to VMI, Peterson curbed the Mountain-
eers’ practice schedule in the week leading up
to Saturday’s game in an effort to rejuvenate
his players and keep them “mentally fresh,”
the coach said.

“But we didn’t want it as much as they
did,” Peterson said. “I thought we played
very timid.”

With the Mountaineers in a tailspin and
the Wildcats on their first winning streak
since mid-January, McKillop remains hope-
ful about Davidson’s chances for a regular
season title.

Last road game of the season
ends in a Wildcat victory

Davidson barely escaped a late-game
comeback by the VMI Keydets Monday night
as the Wildcats pulled out a 71-58 victory at

Cameron Hall.

=> “We were lucky,”
tA >
a coach Bob McKillop
e 2 said after watching
several VMI shots go

in-and-out that could have pulled the Keydets
ahead in the closing minutes of the game.

Stephen Marshall paced the Wildcats
with 20 points and 10 rebounds, his fourth
double-double of the season. Jason Dickens
recorded 15 points.

The Keydets, who shot just over 30 per-
cent from the floor, managed to connect on
only four of their 18 second half free throws.

Quite a few of those misses came at
crucial times when the Keydets had chances
to cut Davidson’s lead to a manageable one.

The Wildcats didn’t do much to improve
that lead down the stretch as they struggled
from the line themselves in the closing min-
utes of the game.

The outcome of Tuesday night’s Appa-
lachian State-UNC Greensboro game will
determine whether the Wildcat’s hopes for a
share of the regular season title stay alive.

A win by App State would give the
Mountaineers the title outright and make
Davidson the No. 2 North Division seed in
the Southern Conference tournament.

If the Spartans win, the Wildcats still
have a chance for a piece of the regualar
season title.

“Tm the eternal optimist,” said McKillop.
“As far as I’m concerned, first place is still
available.

“We're sure as heck going to try to get
that first spot.”

Bree finally

quiets skeptics

By Burain Harbin

What will they talk about now?

After the 1999 graduation of Ali Ton,
Davidson’s all-time assists leader, people
enjoyed sensationalizing Ton’s departure as
a detrimental loss that would drive the Wild-
cats into'the ground.

Michael Bree, Ton’s protege during the
1998-99 season and point guard of the future,
had committed five turnovers in a matter of
minutes in his first collegiate game, and that
performance unfortunately defined Bree in
many fans’ minds for the rest of the season.

But things have changed.

“I don’t fear anybody anymore,” said
Bree after posting a career-high | 1 assists in
the Wildcats’ win over ETSU several weeks
ago. -

“T try to be confident and poised with the
ball,” Bree continued. “I’m seeing things a
lot better now than I did last year.”

Working through early-season inconsis-
tency, Bree has developed into one of the top
point guards in the Southern Conference at a
time when Davidson needs his leadership and
talent at the point. ,

“Michael’s really taken ownership of
this team, which we need the point guard to

do,” head coach Bob McKillop Said after

Bree’s | l-rebound performance at Appala-
chian State Saturday.

Going into Monday night’s game against
VMI, Bree had recorded 42 assists over the
last seven games and had turned over the ball
just five times.

Maybe it’s his energy, maybe it’s his
intense commitment to his team and to being
the best, or maybe it’s what McKillop calls
his “tough Irish grit” that has helped Bree
push past the skeptics.

“T have confidence in myself,” said Bree
during the preseason. “So I don’t have to
worry about what other people say.”

Now, as the regular season draws to a
close, the only thing people are saying is that
Michael Bree has a bright future ahead of
him. And fans are hoping that future includes
a 2000 Southern Conference tournament
championship.

With the Wildcats playing the best bas-
ketball in the Southern Conference right now,
it appears the pieces are coming together for
arun at the tournament title. And one thing is
for sure, the Micheal Bree piece fits into the
point perfectly.
