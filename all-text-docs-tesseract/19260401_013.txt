the Philippines he given their immediate in-
dependence.” Mack King and F. M. Daniel
took the affirmative side of the question and
Riggs McConnell and H. H. Roseberry took
the negative side. Both sides were well de-
veloped and presented. The judges decided
in favor of the affirmative. In voting on
the merits of the question, the house also
decided in favor of the affirmative. The
meeting adjourned after a few remarks by
the critic, in which he complimented those
who took part on the program.

Metrophilian Society

number present. The regular business was
disposed of first, and it was decided to change
the meeting night from 8:30 on Thursday to
7:15 on Tuesday. This was followed by an
open discussion on “Evolution,” with Camp
O'Neal ds first critic. This was a very in-
teresting question which brought comment
from all sides. Charley McRae and D. F.

debating circles. They have two men on the
team that debates Pittsburg and the same
number on the team that will debate P. C.

Beautiful Lake Located
on Present Golf Course

“Lake Lure” Covered Fourteen
Acres—Was Gift of Salisbury
Trustee

During the past month there has been
much agitation on the campus in an en-
deavor to get a swimming pool. The
college catalogue describes a prospective
swimming pool in very glowing terms
but as ‘yet no plan for its construction
has materialized.

This agitation recalls the fact that Da-
vidson once possessed a beautiful lake
known as Lake Lure. This sheet of water
was located on the golf course in the

cupies.

The lake covered fourteen acres and
was a gift to the college from S. H.

Wiley, Esq., of Salisbury, who was a
trustee of the college. The students made
contributions of Jabor and funds and
pledged themselves to work one after-
week on its construction, The
college bought the land and additional
acres for the construction park
about the lake. The dam was washed
away three times in the first four years
of its When the dam was
destroyed for the last time the College
Magazine reported that Davidson had “a
broken dam by a lake site, but no lake by
a dam sight.”

The dam was rebuilt by the class of
190. The class also built a toboggan
slide which is the first recorded class

In 1909 sewage pipes were run into the

valley above the lake and it became nec-
essary to drain it for sanitary reasons.
The side is now occupied by the golf

WHEN the first ball game
is here. And the heavy
hitter cracks the ball
shrieking into deep cen-
ter for a home run —
have a Camel!

For Camel adds the
magic of its own fra-

such choice tobaccos that
they never tire the taste

You'll get more

So this fair spring day

oh, then, taste the smoke
