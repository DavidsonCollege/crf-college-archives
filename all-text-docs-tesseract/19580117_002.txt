Let's Move Into The New
Court With Problems Solved

With our new fraternity court’s
construction weil under way, we must
now turn our attention to perfect-
ing the mechanics of our fraternity
system.

In short; we must prevent the ill
that causes us to move in. the first
place.

One of the main reasons for mov-
ing to the new court is that we have
simply outgrown the present facilities.
The houses on the old court. were de-
signed to accommodate 35 or 40 mem-
bers. Some chapters now have twice
that number. -

Prevent Reoccurrence

It seems imperative, therefore,
that-we make some provision to pre-
vent a reoccurrence of the overcrowd-
ing problem. It also seems logical that
now is the time to take some action—
before we move into the court. Now
is the time to shut the barn door

How can this best be done?

The so-called preferential bidding
system is a good answer to the prob-
lem.

Preferential Bidding

The actual. mechanics of the pref-
erential bidding system can vary in
degree to meet our specific situation.
Basically. the system would match up
the bids from each fraternity with
the expressed desires of each rushee
to achieve the highest correlation of
wishes. 5;

Such a system means that first of

all there must be a reliable and dis-

interested agent to carry out the
mechanics. Perhaps the Dean of Stu-
dents or a faculty group would be suit-
able.

Secondly, the fraternities must
agree voluntarily upon a reasonable
number at which to limit the mem-
bership. Certainly seventy or eighty
men. are .too.many. for an_ effective
fraternal organization. A more satis-
factory number would be fifty or sixty
~-that is, a pledge class. of twelve to
fifteen new members each. year

Model System

Every fraternity man should ac-
quaint himseif with the features. of
this system. The Interfraternity Coun-
cil, moreover, should set up a pro-
gram to familiarize the student body
with its advantages. A forum at which
students could explore the system
would be helpful.

The fraternity system at Davidson
can be a model for other colleges to
follow. It has already taken. three
steps in that direction. The first,- of
course, is the new half-million dollar
court. An earlier ‘rush week was the
second, and a more mature Hell Week
was the third,

The IFC deserves congratulations
for the fine work that it has already
done this year. :

Preferential Bidding would round
out the progressive* changes. |

Sputnik And
Education

“ Like gunpowder changed the
science, of war, so Russia’s Sputnik is
causing American educators to change
their way of thinking about Johnny
and the three R’s.

Sputnik, it seems certain, has been
a blessing in awakening us to the
fact that high school education should
be more than club meetings, home-
room periods, the Friday night foot-
ball game, and a wide range of elec-
tive subjects.

For some time now our high
schools have been emphasizing per-
sonality development more than the
traditional subjects of reading, writ-
ing, and arithmetic. Furthermore, all
students are usually taught the same
basic course regardless of their edu-
cational plans after high school.

The present public high school cur-
riculum in many instances is missing
the boat when it comes to preparing
students for their. particular . needs
after high school.

Roughly speaking, there are two
groups of high school students: those
who plan to go to college and those
who will go directly to work after
graduation from public school.

For this reason, high school edu-
cation should be divided into two
fields: a pre-college course and a
skilled trade course.

The latter group would of course
be the larger. To these students
should be taught some practical skill
like woodworking, plumbing, electri-
city, mechanics, or secretarial work.
Naturally it would be. wise to expose
them to a survey of history; basic
arithmetic, spelling, and a- civics
course. But their primary emphasis
should be upon learning some skilled
trade. :

The pre-college, group, on the
other hand, should be given several
years of foreign language, higher
mathematics, advanced English, more
history, and perhaps a taste of the
non-essentials (for high school, that

better educated

It is clear that not all students
should go to college. Not everyone is
suited for it either emotionally or
mentally. A dual.system of high school
curriculum would take into account
this reality that exists: among our
teenagers.

In the long run this dual system
would do a service to our society by
giving the pre-college. student a bet-
ter foundation for further study, and
by preparing the non-college student
to make a better living and.to con-
tribute more to society by his individ-
ual skilled. knowledge

If Sputnik as it travels its orbit is
able to make American educators take
a new look at our present set-up, per-
haps Johnny Jones of 2058 will be a
an than his grand-
daddy of 1958.

More From The
Music Dept.

Davidson College prides herself on
the well-rounded program: she offers,
both in the curricular and in extra-
curricular activities. One place in
which the school can be justly proud
is in the achievements of the Music
Department.

THE DAVIDSONIAN wishes to
commend the Male Chorus, the Chapel
Choir, and the Bands for their many
and varied performances of the past.

But we would hasten to point out
that recently we have not heard
enough from these groups. We realize
the time and practice that is required
in order to present good perform-
ances, and it is precisely for this rea-
son that we urge more performances.
That is, any group that works as con-
sistantly hard as these groups-do, de-
serves to be heard from more often.

This is our suggestion. We believe
that the musical talents of the school
should be displayed more often,
notably and preferably in the morn-
ing Chape) Services. We believe that
this would benefit the groups them-
selves, as well as be a source of en-
joyment for the student body general-

is) like hygiene, psychology, music ap- ly
preciation, and typing. —G.L.W.

FRIDAY, JANUARY 17, 1958 |

By DABNEY STUART

“Allow a man to return to the
campus under the influence of
alcoho) providing he — goes
straight to his room. His. con-
duct after his return will be
covered by the ‘gentlemanly
conduct’ clause. (See. 1, Art.9)”
This has appeared to be the
prevalent suggéstion for a
workable drinking rule by those
who favor the deletion of the
present one stated in Section
3, Article 9 of the Student Body
Constitution.

IMPLICATIONS

It is upon this assumption
that the following remarks and
questions are based. What are
the implications inherent in the
position itself?

First, the issue seems to

Under the proposed replac-

ing rule the conditions of choice

are shifted. The law would re-

quire “gentlemanly conduct” on
the student's return to campus
after he has become influenced

by alcohol. He must choose how
to conduct himself after he has
been affected; He must make a
choice when he is not in as com-
plete control of his: faculties
as he would be when ‘he was
sober.

mr

INTERPRET ATION

Secondly, there would still
exist. the problem of interpre-

tation. What is “gentlemanly
conduct?” Where would the
line be drawn? Again there

seems. to be a shifting, this time
of the problem of interpreting
a phrase on which the spirit of
the law depends. One would be
demanded to decide whether a
student affected by alcohol was
acting as a gentleman instead
of whether he was affected.

Thirdly, would this new

LETTER TO EDITOR

‘Drawn, Squeezed, Pushed’

Dear Editor:

The great myth about David-
son College that predominates
as far as does its sphere of in-
fluence, is that it is hard. It
is not so in comparison to the
state schools whose. curriculum
is designed to weed out al! non-
coliege material before the Ju-

nior year.

PRESSURES

Before you throw this down
in disgust, reflect on just why
Davidson provides rough-going
for you. Is it not because of un-
warranted pressures to which
you are subjected??—not mere-
ly from the standpoint of ex-
tra-curricular work, but extend-
ed also into the classroom.

This is no less than ‘the back-
bone of instruction at Davidson.
Through the years it has shored
up its mold around the student
with new reforms and modifi-
cations, until now there exists
an almost completed machine

mechanism stands ready to
knead you from sides, top, and
bottom should you not fill every
pocket of its mold, This machine
comprehends only the precision

achievement of its purpose? Has

a liberdl view of the arts, or

‘an arty view of the liberals?

APATHETIC, INSIPID
Education in the arts of man-
kind at Davidson consists pri-
marily of an apathetic doling out
of an insipid portion of facts
made from the same recipe and
dished from the same pot as

twenty years ago, minus the.
' spice of opinion and the sauce

of thought.

The machine grinds on; the
product wears red and black
and bears the good-grade-keep-
ing seal of approval; it matters
little if it thinks or just ticks . .
The distinctive lines in par-
ticular form of intellect are

erased and replaced by aca-

demic cubism.  _

A Plea For Negro Students

Dear Editor,

In the light of the segrega-
tion issue, a vital question to
many of us is how long David-

son will remain all-white (with —

the exception of a few Orient-
als). Most of the respectable
and progressive Eastern schools
now have Negro students; and
these are the institutions in
whose class Davidson likes to
consider itself. Many brilliant
Negroes who cannot afford the
high cost of these schools are

-forced to go to the poor Negro

universities of the South. These

students would jump at a
chance to come to a school like
Davidson.
INCONSISTENT

Davidson's present segregated
Status has no support in the
position of the Church, and it
is inconsistent with the pur-
poses of the school itself. If
Davidson is to emphasize the
quality of the education it of-
fers, then students should be
selected on the basis of their
ability to do the work. And let's
face it, there are some boys
here who would be better off

elsewhere.

SEEK NEGROES

It has been suggested that
some of our better white stu-
dents would leave if Negroes
were admitted. However, my ob-
servation is that only a few
would do this, and the school
can afford to lose those who
would. The time has come for
Davidson College to seek quali-
fied Negro students to fill the
places now occupied by incapa-

ble and intolerent whites.
—Joe Bell

One would be called upon to
judge gentlemanly conduct more
often ‘than he is now obliged
to judge alcoholic influence, be-
cause he would see more stu-
dents to whom he would have
to apply the law.

CHANGE OF WORDS?

A final question. Does the ma-
jority who favors this particu-
lar change really want any re-

strictions at all? Is this merely
a change of words and not of
practice? Is this proposal made
with the tacit assumption that
it will be enforced no better
than the present. rule?

We will find no perfect: so.
lution. We are seeking a prob-
lem of smaller dimensions than
the one we now have. We want
a Tule that “works” better.
which has fewer loopholes. Does
the proposed change questioned
herein fill this need?

COFFEE BREAK

Critici

It seems that we have worked
over rather thoroughly the short-
comings of the students here.
Everybody is talking about
conformity, even if nobody is
doing much about it. Let us
now look instead at the short-
comings in what the school it-
self ‘offers the students.

From the very start, however,
it should be kept in mind that
this is only criticism with the
aim of improvement; if we were
genuinely dissatisfied with the
school we would have left long

ago.

OWN CHOICE
In coming to Davidson, we
knowingly chose a small, Chri-
tian, liberal arts school as op-

: posed to a state university or

a technical school, We should
have understood that we. were
choosing a school with necessari-
ly limited, curriculum and small
faculty. In exchange for the
lack in quantity, we expected
greater quality, closer contact
with the professors as well as
the students.

The students have certainly
failed to take advantage of the
chances to know the faculty
closely by. visiting on Sunday
nights, and for this. lack of so-
cial contact we are to blame.

However, as for real intellectu-.

al contact with the professors
outside of class there is little
push or inspiration. More’ inte-
grated four o'clock coffee
breaks at the Union and plan-
ned, higher-level discussions on
Sunday and even week nights
might help this situation.
BASIC SHORTCOMING
The basic shortcoming in the
Davidson education is that it
is all pointed to the rear. Past
events and past ideas are
studied as things of the past,

with no reference to the pres-
ent. Although very definitely
classical studies are essential to
_a well-rounded education, the
studies of the past might be
related to present conditions or
current interpretations. The pur-
pose of an education is to turn
out a valuable citizen prepared
for living on various. levels.
However, isolated courses here
are not necessarily related to
the current ideas and probiems
of the outside world, even in
full year courses.

How many business and eco-.
nomies majors actually try to
study the national budget or
play the stock market? Do any
English majors understand the
ideas behind the New Criticism?

tic analysis are vital today in
creative philosophy, and) much
of today's psychology is cen-
tered around behaviorism, but
few students in these fields have
really been faced with these ap

These are all topics which
are being discussed today in the
greater world outside, and ed
cated graduates should be ab)
to talk intelligently — abo

which did not coincide with

The United States had taken

Britain needed markets so bad-
ly that she decided that the

enough to risk incurring the
