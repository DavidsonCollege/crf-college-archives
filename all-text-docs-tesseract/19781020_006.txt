Go Buckingham |

By ROBERT PARK
Staff Writer

Editor's Note: Senior Robert
Park spent last year at the
University of Buckingham in
England. The following article
is a brief synopsis of his
experiences.

I had hoped that time would
afford me some measure of ob-
jectivity in looking at my nine
months at Buckingham, but
then I am not sure if it has or
ever really will.

I have been absent from Da-
vidson since Winter term 1977;
all but the senior class and a

London, and 25 miles from Ox-
ford. It_used to be the county
seat for Buckinghamshire, but
time and the industrialization of
Aylesbury have seen that
changed.

The résidents of Buckingham .

tolerate the university’s pre-
sence. It is an imposition upon
their lifestyle and pace. They
had no choice. The town paper's
editor is an avid critic of the
University, and does his level
best to foster discontent. All in
all it is an uneasy partnership.
Buckingham, in the truest
sense of the word, is an experi-
ment; the first private universi-

handful of juniors are strangers —ty for some fifty years within

to me. Even one-time close
‘friends must contend with an
eighteen month void. I am out
of the ordinary.

Buckingham itself is an odd
little place to escape to, without
the new left of Marburg, the
Fabian Socialism of East Ang-
lia, or the gun of Montpellier;
Buckingham must satisfy itself
with the abiding love. of the
Conservative party.

The town is a sleepy market
center bastardized’by the twen-
tieth century. It is situated 60
miles to the Northwest of

Britain. Great Britain’s univer-
‘sities are state run and state
subsidized. Private, post-secon-
dary level education, which we
take for granted, runs contrary
to the Labour party’s educa-
tional.philosophy.
Buckingham has been duti-
fully received. It has no royal
charter, and thus issues liscen-
ses rather than degrees at -pre-
sent. The license is not recog-:
nized by either the Civil Service
or the Military. Every possible

ty’s path. Indeed, the school is

supported efitirely by fees and
contributions. The state pro-
vides:no aid.

Thus, while a student at Bast
Anglia is almest ‘assured of a
freé education, a student at
Buckingham. must find some
7000° dollars for a year.- And
though this may not frighten
you, that sum is equal to the
average ‘yearly income for a’
family of four in England. Some
scholarship money is available,
but as yet itis too little.

The student body is small,
even by Davidson's standards --
276 people. Buckingham is not
a British university as such,
only 25 percent of the students
are British. The schoo) wills to

but the students to date misre-
present the efforts.

Students come from all over
the globe; Asia, the Middle
East, Africa, Europe, even
South America. There are some
30 or 40 Nigerians, mostly on
Government grants, a 45 year
old one time coal miner, a Saudi
Arabian prince, Malaysians, a
charming man from Guyana, a
crazy guy from Yorkshire. The
variety is endless.

The average age of the stu-
dents is about 25, one is dealing
with a mature student. body,
one that actually has some his-
tory to it. Many have already
known responsibility. To be
sure there are retreads, those
fro whom Buckingham is a last
chance, but even they in a
strange way contribute to the

e University of Buckingham are quite different from Davidson a

character of the university.

Buckingham, like no other
place I have ever known, is a
home to the individual. Charac-
ters abound.. David Close, resi-
dent communist, passes out on
the common room floor quite re-
gularly from overconsumption;
George Goulandris, resident
charmer, could seduce a buz-
zard off a dung heap.

Jack Straw and Caryl Rams-
den, assistant to the and Pro-
principal administration respec-
tively, will assist you in the
most imaginative ways, what-
ever the endeavour; Prof. Vere-
ker, pro-principal academic, is
the closest thing I have found to
a Platonic guardian; Mrs. Long
makes the best breakfasts -- one
by one. Again the list is
endless.

Americans along with the
British are the financial peasan-
try. We are considered a bit ar-
rogant, cliquish, self-righteous
and myopic. One will be tested,
and failure is not treated kindly.
Buckingham courts and covets
the American student, but in no
way is one guaranteed a social
and/or academic Shangri La.
One faces ostracism if too
stubborn. One is really only
asked to look at the other side of
the coin, something that our re-
lative isolation has allowed us
to avoid. One must present an
open mind. .

Buckingham is a chance to
open your eyes. It is to sit
between an Egyptian and an Is-
raeli as Sadat talks to the
Knesset. It is to watch very

human reactions to a miniature
melting pot. It is to talk all
night with someone who experi-
enced Biafra. It is to see the Pa-
lestinian point of view. It is to
catch a bit of fantasy in an all
too real world. It’s something, a
gamble, that I am glad I took.

I walked the moors and saw

‘the Cliffs of Dover. I saw ——

Brixton, a London slum, and
Buckingham Palace on the
same day.

I spent Christmas and New
Years in the North with Mr.
Ramsden and his wife, and saw
wonderful things and spent
wonderful times. I grew to love
London. .I fell in love occas-
sidnally...and was pursued. I
even did some work. ;

Buckingham will not wean or_
coddle you like Davidson. You
do not have progress tests or
papers. Your grade depends
upon your final. A far greater
measure of responsibility is
placed upon your shoulders.

No one tells you what or how
much to do. One does not
receive a reading list, but rather
a bibliography, and from there
it is your move. And horror of
horrors one must go all the way
to Oxford for his books.

Failure is not a motive for
suicide, and grade inflation does
not exist -- 70 is a First or an
“A”. Cramming is an art form
at Buckingham. It is my only
possible objection to the sys-
Tutors are as near as the pub
and their time canbe bought for —
a pint. They are often graduate
students fully aware of puten-
tial pitfalls. Their time is a
haven for both gripes and inte-
rests. The busiest will always
spot you a moment.

One goes to the loo or the bog
and not the bathroom; and
when someone tells you to wait
a minute while they fetch their
fags -- it’s cigarrettes they're
after. One gets “pissed’’ and
does so by “firing up.” Stu-
dents with a hangover awake
feeling nackered. Do not, wear
bermuda shorts.

Buckingham was wonderful
for me, as was England. That is~
not an unconditional recom-
mendation—on the contrary, it
has quite a fow restrictions.
Cliche or no, Buckingham is
what you make it and what it
makes you. The pace is frigh-
tening, the game competetive.
It, rains constantly and therein
lies manic depression, but if you
just remember to bring a rain-
