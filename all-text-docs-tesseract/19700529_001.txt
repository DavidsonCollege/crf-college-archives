NUMBER TWENTY-NINE

EPC Endorses
Self - Scheduling

By RICH WILSON

Asst. Managing Editor

The Educational Policy
Committee (EPC) at last
Monday's meeting passed a
resolution to recommend to
the faculty some form of
self-scheduled exams on a
two year trial basis.

Although this resolution will
not affect exams this Spring,
the EPC hopes the program
will be in effect for Fall
term exams.

“The idea of self-scheduled
exams involved two basic
considerations,’ said EPC
student representative Danny
Clodfelter. ‘‘The. first was
Whether the honor system
could bear the strain of a

self-scheduled exams propos- -

al, and the second concerned
the actual mechanics of the
program.

“This resolution — resolves
the first question. The EPC
feels that if the Honor Court
informs the students of their
responsibilities during the ex
am week, the honor system
will survive

“What this resolution means
is that the EPC is committed
‘to the idea of self-scheduled
exams. Now the committee
must resolve the second ques-
tion of the actual mechanics
of the program.”

Clodfelter said he felt that
the committee would work
out the details of the pro
gram in the remaining weeks
of school so that the prgposal
would be in the hands‘of the
faculty early next fall.

however,
which

The resolution,
contains a clause
limits the self-scheduled ex
ams program to two years.
The philosophy behind ‘this
restriction, according to‘EPC
member Daniel D. Rhodes,
professor of Bible and relig
ion, is to insure that the sys-

tem be reviewed to see
Whether it is working well.
“If this program is_ insti-

tuted, we want to make sure
that it just doesn’t slide
along. This is why the EPC

voted to restrict the program
to two years. We want to re-

view it to see whether it is
worth the price,’” Rhodes
said.

“This idea of  self-sched-
uled exams may be worth
trying. but grave questions
remain open as to whether
the students will buckle down

and really make the honor
system function,"’ he said.
‘EPC member Bible and

Religion Professor Max E.
Polley felt that the system
will work; however, he said
that “the student may be at
a disadvantage without a@
cess to the professor.”

“No matter how clearly I

think I've made “out a test,
many times there is some-
thing vague which I don't

realize. This could be a prob
lem in some cases,” he sad.

Executive Committee Responds
MEMORANDUM TO: The Faculty
FROM: The Executive Committee
The Executive Committee has received a number of
proposals from student leaders for college-wide alterations
of classes and calendar for the remainder of this term

and for next fall.

The Executive Committee concludes that,

in spite of

extraordinary disturbances of recent weeks, the primary
obligation of the College is to its educational program.
We therefore think it unwise to agree to interrupt the
college’s program by granting the request for a three day
, holiday this week, or to abandon the basic educational
: requirements of the current term.

But because we recognize the acute concern of many

students with current affairs, the Executive Committee |.
authorizes individual members of the Faculty at their “<
discretion, in addition to allowing term papers to be pest-
poned until the end of the term, as presently authorized
under faculty rules, to set aside faculty-rules on absences
and make-up reviews for those students who wish to par-
ticipate in public affairs away from the campus between
now and beginning of the examination period on June 6.

3 The Executive Committee does not authorize changes

in examination schedules or relieve any student from his
responsibility for completing the requirements of his -
courses by the end of the term. S
The Executive Committee also expects to recommend ~
to the Faculty that some means be provided so that stu-
dents who wish to do so may participate in public affairs
in the fall, provided that no shortening of the term occurs.

eaceful Demonstrators

Watch ROTC Awards Drill

About 120 students joined
freshmen John Wackman and
David Sengel Tuesday in
presenting the Davidson Col-
lege ROTC department with
its second protest within the
past month.

In a letter last week, Wack-
man and Sengel had warned
Colonel Virgil P. Foster, pro
fessor of military. science, of
their intention to stage a
peaceful demonstration dur-
ing the ROTC drill.

Foster had agreed to allow
the protestors entrance to
the drill field on the condi-
tion that the protest would
be orderly and’ that demon-
strators remain in the stands
of the football stadium.

Accordingly the demonstra-
tors gathered in the stands
in silence and remained

quiet through the 40 minute,

drill.
Although some _ students
complained after the ‘drill

that the protest had been too
mundane to have significant
effect, Wackman and Sengel
earlier had said that their

aim was not ‘te interfere with
the ROTC
fringe upon the
members of this
community,”

In their earlier letter to
Foster, Wackman and Sengel
had stated their purpose as
wanting ‘“‘to express our in
creasing concern over the
national administration's pol-
icy of war.”

They had hoped that the
drill would include the tra-
ditional spring federal inspec-
tion and that government of
ficials from outside the col-
lege would be on hand to wit-
ness the demonstration, ac
cording to Wackman.
