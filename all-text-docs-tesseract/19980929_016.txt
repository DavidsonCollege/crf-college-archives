Field Hockey shines at home but loses 3 of 4 on the road —

By ALISON KALETT
Sports Editor

Davis and Elkins College never
had a chance on Saturday against the
1998 Lady Wildcats Field Hockey team.
The Wildcats (2-5) dominated the game
from the onset in route to a 6-0 trounc-
ing of their opponents.

11:53 left gave the Wildcats a solid 2-0
lead heading into the second half.

Inthe second period the ‘Cats truly
dominated. They outshot their oppo-
nents by an impressive 13 to 1 margin
and added four additional goals. The
Davidson second half scorers were Kate
Schoening, Lisa Holthaus, Ashley Hart,
and Laura Rosenbach. Rosenbach’s goal
with 1:30 left in the game was the icing
on the cake in Davidson’s 6-0 route.

The win over Davis and Elkins
marked the Wildcats second win of the
season. The first one came the previous
Saturday at the University of Louisville
where Davidson escaped with a 3 to 2
win.

The one goal margin is deceptive ’

as the last of Louisville’s scores came in
the final seconds of play.

In the first half, Davidson players
Amy Lamoriaux and Jennie Gold scored
at 14:05 and 2:05 respectively, while
Louisville was able to cut the Davidson
lead to a'single goal with 15:40 remain-
ing in the first half.

The second period was closely
contested, but a score by #3 Lisa
Holthaus with slightly over 11 minutes
left in the game sealed the victory for
the ‘Cats.

The win over Louisville came on
the heels of a tough defeat to Catawba
College (1-2) on September 15th.

The Lady Indians took an early 2-
0 lead on the Wildcats, but Davidson
fought back when sophomore Ashley
Hart scored with 8:45 remaining in the
first half.

The second half was a see-saw
battle of scoring. Catawba scored with
27:16 to play, but Lisa Holthaus of
Davidson brought the Wildcats back
within one with 12:29 left. However, a
Davidson victory was not meant to be
as Catawba’s Elizabeth Howard put the
Indians ahead by an insurmountable
two goal margin with a little less than
four minutes remaining. Davidson lost
by a score of 4 to 2.

Unfortunately, Davidson also lost
two other road games earlier in the
week. One to the University of Ohio on
Sep. 20th and another to Radford on the
23rd. Against Radford the Wildcats
mounted a late second-half comeback,
but three first half scores and one sec-
ond-half goal were enough to give
Radford the 4-2 victory. Against the
University of Ohio, the Wildcats fell 5
to 0.
