Trustees, Faculty View
Christian Commitment

By BRUCE MALOY
Managing Editor

The Davidson’ College
Trustees began their spring
session yesterday with a joint
meeting with the faculty and
staff. The meeting, held at 2:30
p.m. in Hodson Hall, was to
study the nature of the
Christian commitment of the
college.

Two educators who have writ-
ten on religion and education
spoke on ‘‘How can Davidson
best express its continuing
Christian commitment?”

They were Roland M. Frye,
English professor at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, and Rene
D. Williamson, chairman of the
department of government at
Louisiana State University and
a former Davidson professor.

press its Christian com-

Bevan Calls For New Academic
Focus To Meet Future Needs

By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

“There will be a significant
shift in coming years at David-
son toward increasing em-
phasis in the liberal arts, as op-
posed to preparation for the
medical, legal, and business
professions,’’ forecasted Vice
President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan.

Bevan stated this week that
the admissions squeeze in law
schools and medical schools
will get even tighter in next
decade.

Partly because of this, he
thinks that students and faculty
members must begin to think of
Davidson as something more
than a pleasant interlude bet-

Get Student

By BRUCE CORSER
Asst. Managing Editor

The general student
referedum Wednesday resulted
in a change in the SGA con-
stitution allowing for the elec-
tion of either a rising junior or
rising senior for the presiden-
tial spot.

Of the 360 students respon-
ding. 68.6 percent registered a
positive vote for this amend-
ment, 10 votes over the
necessary two-thirds majority
necessary for approval.

A similar proposal pertaining
to the vice presidential office
passed with a 80.4 percent af-
firmative response.

Prior to this revision, the SGA
president had to be a rising
senior and the vice president a
rising junior.

A third proposed con-
stitutional innovation,
providing that the SGA

president and vice president
would be eligible for re-election,
captured a 53.2 percent positive
vote. Nevertheless, it failed sin-
ce the proposal lacked a

ween high school and the
ubiquitous ‘‘good’’ graduate
school.

‘‘Presently many students
think of Davidson as just a
great place to go to gain ad-
mission to a graduate school.
For them, Davidson is just a
spring board.

While this was possible
during the 50's and 60's, we may
have to face the possibility in
the future that for many stu-
dents Davidson will be the
culmination of their study,’
said Bevan.

Bevan indicated that future
policy decisions in the program
area must take into account
that students will regard David-
son as a “total and self-
supporting experience” rather

necessary two-third vote for
enactment.

A third addition, that passed
93.3 percent vote, was a

proposal aimed at fitting the
composition of the Senate with
the changing student body.

Bo Phillips, present SGA
head, said that he was ‘“‘quite
pleased” with the referendum
results. He had introduced the
amendments concerning
opening up the presidential and
vice presidential offices to dif-
ferent classes.

“This means more flexibility
for the SGA,” Phillips com-
mented. He noted that no longer
would ‘‘any one class be geared
up for electing one of its mem-
bers to the presidency.”

Bob Corlew. SGA _ vice
president, related that he was
disappointed the student body
would let the president be a
rising junior. ‘I don't believe a
person who has had one and a
half vears experience at David-
son can be as effective as a per
son who has had two and a halt
years experience, regardless ot
how capable.” he said

than as a stepping stone.

“This does not mean, of
course, that we will slacken our
efforts to place our seniors in
graduate and professional
schools.

“To the contrary, I am en-
couraging our faculty to make
contact with the various
graduate schools. so that we
will have every advantage that
comes with increasing
familiarity,"’ Bevan said.

Bevan stated that the profile
of this year's entering freshman
class showed that 90 percent of
the students were planning on
attending graduate school, law

school, medical school. or
seminary.
“We may have to look at

passages in our catalog which
promulgate the notion of David-
son as a prelude to graduate
school, an instant ticket to ad-
mission,’ Bevan said.

“I am concerned with the
student who is so obsessed with
getting into law school or
medical school that he feels like
a complete failure when his ap-
plications are not accepted.

“The competent student will
not hinge his goals on anything
so fragile as going to a certain
graduate school. If rejection
from med school makes him or
her feel like dropping out of life,
we haven't really taught
anything at all." he com-
mented.

Bevan indicated that a shift
toward thinking of the Davidson
experience as a. total ex-
perience was not motivated by
pessimism, but that it would
ultimately create a more
healthy climate on campus.

“We are trying to teach
students about what it’s like to
be human. This should be good
preparation for any kind of
work.

“In addition, we are moving
ever closer to the idea of a
leisure society. With more time
at the disposal of each person, a
larger conception of humankind
will be a greater advantage
tharhwe may think now.” Bevan
stated

its founding in 1837, said
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr.

‘People have been saying for
a long time that we ought to get
together and discuss what our
Christian commitment means,”
added Spencer.

“The main purpose of this
meeting is to take a look at our
Christian commitment,” he
said. ‘| doubt that the trustees
will take any action as a result
of this discussion at this
meeting.

“This is also a good op-
portunity.’ continued Spencer,
“for our faculty, staff and
trustees to get together and just
get to know each other on an in-
formal basis.”

Spencer said that he felt that
this would be “a very light
meeting” and that little action
would be taken. ‘‘In_ the
February meeting.” said Spen-
cer, “the trustees finished up
most of the budget, fees, and
financial matters that they
needed to deal with.”

Vice President for Academic
Affairs and liason to the trustee
committee on athletics said that
he did not feel that any
proposals on _ subsidized
athletics would come out of the
committee at this meeting.

“I imagine.’ said Bevan,
“that they will discuss the
ramifications of their recent
