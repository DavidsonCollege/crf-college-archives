The Wildcat swimmers wrapped up a busy week of travel at t UNC-Wilmington.

The swim team traveled to Durham, N.C.
last Friday to compete against Duke, and the
Blue Devils came out on top against both
Wildcat teams. Duke slipped by the men’s
team 119-95, while the Blue Devils cruised
past the women, 135-70.

The first-year men took charge of the meet
on Friday, pulling out impressive times in
each of their respective events. Fiete Stegger
*08 and Will Broughton ’08 performed par-
ticularly well, registering individual-best
times in each of their events. Stegger placed
first in the 100 free in 0:48.36, and he also
helped lead his relay team to victory in the
200 free relay.

Broughton placed second in the 400 IM
and was victorious in his trademark race, the
500 free, with a time of 4:42.72. Vincent
Nardone ’08 also had a personal-best time of
10:35.72 in the 1000 free.

The women had some bright spots against
the Blue Devils, including Kristen Shields’s
(06) runner-up finish in both the 50 and 500
free and Maddie Stough’s (08) personal-
best in the 400 IM. Diver Christie Brough
’07 finished second in the three-meter, while

from McCrory, page 12

fill its coaching vacancy with McKillop,
who seemed like a perfect candidate with his
Manhattan roots and proven record as a win-
ner. It’s one thing to turn down another mid-
major program, but St. John’s is not one of
them.

McKillop is still here, though, plodding
along to.a 7- 0 record in the Southern

another NCAA tournament run.

When McKillop does eventually leave,
whether it is due to retirement or finally
moving on, Davidson should be fine. For our
sake, though, I hope that time is not soon in
coming.

We do not have the flashiest team. We are
not stocked with lightning-quick, high-rising
athletes, but we come to play every night
with a toughness and intelligence that comes
directly from the top.

It is no coincidence that Davidson is
‘ shooting over 74 percent form the free throw
line and out-rebounds its opponents by an

average of seven each game. McKillop

preaches fundamentals and execution, and
because of that he is able to create a winning
formula regardless of the ciréumstances he
faces.

Very few schools are lucky enough to have
a coach that believes not only in winning, but
as Larry Brown would say, winning “the
right way.”

We have that, and because of McKillop,
we can also still have that dream of being
one of the big boys, if only for a moment.

Judit Otvos ’05 placed second in her one-
meter event.

After the Friday meet, the two Davidson
teams traveled to UNC-Wilmington to rest
up for a Saturday afternoon meet against two
of their closest rivals, UNC-W and William
& Mary. The women fell to both UNC-W
and William & Mary, with scores of 169-72
and 124- 115, respectively. The men were
victorious ‘against William & Mary by a 123-
110 margin but lost to UNC-W 164-72.

Broughton led his team again with a sea-
son-best first-place finish in the 1000 free,
and he was also victorious in the 500 in

4:48.51. Stegger was also victorious in the:

200 IM (1:58.61).

The women were led by their underclass-
men as well, including Eli Trefzger’s (’07)
win in the 1000 free (10:39.08). Kirsten
Allen ’08 placed second in the 200 free, and
she also notched a third-place finish in the
400 relay with fellow teammates Leslie
Sherrill °08, Brigit Barry ’07 and Jenny
Hoekstra ’05.

Davidson will next host the Radford
women and VMI men this upcoming
Saturday. That afternoon, the Wildcats will
also honor all senior swimmers since it is the
last home meet of the season.
