The Social Council has already
booked the Ramsey Lewis Trio, come-

Davy and the Collegiates

Combo for Friday night, and Chairman
Dan Campbell was planning this week

to sign one of “several good possi-

Maps pinpointing the House of
Music, about 15 minutes from the
campus, will be available, and a bus
will run back and forth for those with-

out transportation.

In addition, Campbell said that

Deep Snow Batters Davidson

But Fails To Interrupt Classes

By MASON STEPHENSON
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The South's worst winter
storm in years struck the Caro-
linas last weekend during the
semester break, but ‘neither the
rain, sleet, snow nor gloom of
night’’ caused the cancellation
of classes on Monday.

According to a local newspa-
per, “the governors of Virginia
and Maryland declared a state
of emergency and air, bus and
rai) travel was halted in the
northern tier of the South.”

Approximately five inches of
snow fell.in the Charlotte area
on ‘Saturday on top of the re-
maining snow from the previous
storm. On Monday the mer-
‘cury hovered on both sides o
the zero mark in this area an

dropped to -29 degrees on Mt.
Mitchell.

Temperatures were low
throughout the South with snow
on the ground in many of the
states. In Atlanta the low for
Sunday was two below zero and
snow covered northern Alabama
and southern Mississippi.

On Sunday almost all airports
north of Charleston, S. C., were
closed, and after fhe airports
were opened, reservations were
virtually impossible to secure.

Bus and rail travel from Balti-
more south through Virginia was
Halted due to the tertific drift-
ing aeross the highways and rail-
road tracks and switches,

On Sunday the Pennsylvania
Railroad cancelled all trains

CLASSES PROCEED

When Richard C. Burts, dean
of students, was questioned con-
cerning the problem of cancella-
tion of classes in. bad weather,
he said that it was dependent
upon circumstances.

For example, ‘‘if two feet of
snow fell this afternoon, classes
would not. be postponed because
a great majority of the students
were here: But if just before
Christmas holidays ended, two
feet fell, then it would be a dif-
ferent situation. since very few
students are on campus.'’ It de-
pends on the number 9° stu-
dents here, Burts explained.

Burts -reported that -he re-
ceived about 35 phone calls on
Sunday: about the resumption of
classes. on Monday. but the .de-
cision, was made-to hold classes
due to the large number of -stu-
dents already. on campus.

He stated that no systematic
polling has been made on at-
tendance but that in his own first
period Monday class. 17 out of
21 students were present.

However, Dr. W. P. Minter,
associate professor of political
Science, stated that attendance
for his first period class on Mon-
day was “‘rotten:”’ Only one-third
of the students were present:
for the class.

MAINTENANCE ADJUSTS
Grover Meetze, director of the

physical plant, said that his de-
partment “has been doing what
it can."’ Just as the college ex-
perimented with a leaf machine
earlier this fall, the mainten-
ance staff'is trying out a “‘snow
blower” on the walks this win-
ter.

Meetze also said his depart: |.

ment was using chemicals and

shovels as in the past. “There| .;

is not much to do until it
stops.”*

Shovels were issued to the].

janitors in order to clear the ap-
proaches to the different dorms
on campus in ‘Operation Shovel
Brigade.”*

Meetze said that the walks

were better this year, but he is
still not satisfied. Another prob
lem, he said, is the entrances

to the different buildings on

campus where ice forms easily ‘

He said that the snow. blower

Registrar Eyes

Late Teachers

Changing schedules, dropping
classes and arranging easy
courses can often necessitate a
long wait in the Registrar's Of.
fice. While standing there await-
ing your turn, have you ever
‘glanced over at the right wall
and seen the cardboard chart
taped to it?

A squint and perhaps a. cran-
ing of the neck reveals that it
is a list of professors’ names
followed by several small
squares. The squares are col-
ored either black or red. The
title reveals that the chart is a
record of which professors are
prompt about turning in their
grades and which are slack in
their duty.

Registrar Hengeveld respond.
ed with a chuckle when asked
about it. ‘We've been posting
those charts for several years
now, and we've had a lot of fun
with it.”

He explained that there is no
requirement for the chart. and

that professors are not penalized
for being late in turning in their
grades. “It's purely psychologi-
cal," Hengeveld continued, “‘sort
of a game.”

The chart was originated as
an effort to get grades in to
the registrar on time and thus
to the students sooner. ‘In most
cases," he remarked, “it has
worked very well. The squares
are marked black for ‘on time’
and red for ‘late.’ Not many pro-
fessors let the red squares
mount up.”

Another incentive is that the
registrar suggests that the deans
and the president come by every
once in a while and take a look
at the chart, “just to check up.”

The practical advantage of. the
system is that it makes things
easier for the registrar. The
grades get in sooner, for one
thing, and he can predict, on
the basis of the patterns over
the years, which professors will
be late and which will be on
time.

The Ramsey Lewis Trio, “The
Gentlemen of Jazz,” is perhaps the
most entertaining jaz trio in the

country. A lively remnant of the
Clefs, a seven-piece dance band from
Chicago, the Trio still has a large fol-
lowing in the Midwest.

The group has appeared in festi-
vals and concerts all over. the coun-
try, including several college appear-
ances, and has cut five albums and
a number of singles.

Dick Davy, a 32-year-old Arkan-
sas hillbilly, who got his start in a
Greenwich Village coffee shop, made ’
his first professional engagement last
all.

Since then, Davy, a schoolteach-
er of delinquent boys and a veteran
of the picket lines, has appeared on
television and in several night clubs.
He made his first album in November.
Called a “young Will Rogers,” Davy
directs his dialogue toward city folk
and current controversy.
