The Big Event

By MARGARET CARROLL

On Saturday, September 3 the SGA, the
Union, and Patterson Court will~host a
campus-wide band party on the football
field at 6:30. The event is designed to serve
as a way of unifying freshmen, upperclass-
men, and professors and their families in
one activity.

SGA president Harrison Murray ex-
plained that the idea of a campus-wide
event began as a means to cooperate with
administration suggestions of having a

’ “dry rush,’’ which was one of the major
campaign issues last year. The SGA
planned to have several events to which the
freshman would be invited during the time
that they are not allowed on the court.

Wanting to include the Union in the
planning process, the SGA appealed to the
Union for organizational resources. Then
the SGA and the Union asked Patterson
Court council for their support. The PCC,
according to PCC president Eileen Keeley,
felt that one ‘‘big’’ event would be better
than several events because it would gener-

ate more enthusiasm and it would be a
‘‘bigger deal.””

Because the SGA, the Union, and PCC
are working together to sponsor the event,
Murray sees it as not only a positive contri-
bution to the freshmen but as a good way
for three major campus organizations to
cooperate and grow closer as a result.

‘ All of the Patterson Court houses, as well
as the Union, are contributing their money
and siipport to the project.

Both Murray and Union Social Vice
President Frank Whitaker feel that the
party will give the freshmen a chance to
meet upperclassmen Patterson Court
members and Independents in a much more
casual atmosphere so that when they are
allowed on the Court the freshmen will
already have friendships established.

One of the major goals of the party is ‘‘to
put alcohol in the background, demonstrat-
ing its use responsibly,’’ Murray says. He
hopes that the event will become a tradition
at Davidson as a means of unifying the
entire campus.
