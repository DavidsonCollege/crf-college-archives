AN EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS

Davidson Gradually Adopts More Integration

By CHARLES McEWEN
Assistant Managing Editor
The pledging of a Negro by a

fraternity for the first time at
Davidson marked another step
in the progress of integration
at the college which began
with the Board of World
Missions of the Presbyterian
Church, U.S.

The first Negro student who
enrolled at Davidson in Sep-
tember, 1962, ended 125 years
of segregation.

Integration at Davidson was
planned for and anticipated
from the very beginning.
Shortly after the Board of
Trustees in February, 1961.
voted to admit a maximum of
three Congolese students, in-
terested students. faculty and
townspeople worked together
to determine what facilities in
the. town and in Charlotte
would be open to a Negro stu-
dent, whenever the first. Ne-
gro was admitted to Davidson.

The process of integration
has been more an evolutionary

The process was begun by
the Board of World Missions
of the Presbyterian Church.
U.S., when it wrote, prior to
the Board of Trustees meeting
in February, 1961, asking the
college and the Board to con-
sider admitting Congolese stu-
dents.

The Board of World Miss-
ions had presented the propos-
al for integration with the view
that Davidson as a_ church
school might serve as an aid
to mission work in the Congo
by admitting qualified Congo-
lese students.

The action by the Board of
World Missions parallelled
the action of interested stu-
dents on the Davidson campus.
At the February, 1961. Board
of Trustees meeting. Henry
Shue presented a proposal, in
the form of a letter to each

ally discriminatory stipulation
of Davidson's admission policy
be changed to a policy that
would allow the admission of
Negro students.

Although Shue was at that
time president of the student
body, he presented the propos-
al as an individual student.
Members of the YMCA Cab-
inet also had passed a reso-
lution asking for the end of
discriminatory admission pol-
icies.

The Trustees voted to ac-
cept up to three Congolese stu-
dents with certain provisos:
that the Negro students be
Congolese; that such students
be sponsored by the Board of
World Missions and that the
students meet the academic
standards set for all students
admitted to Davidson.

men both in Davidson and in
Charlotte.

“We got a fair hearing from
most people, and in large the
community said that it would
accept a Negro student,”
Rhodes said.

By September. 1961, the Con-
golese Committee had, in addi-
tion to its other work, col-
lected $1,420, including pledg-
es. for the support of a Con-
golese student at Davidson.
whenever a student who met
the qualifications was found.

Success in finding such a
Congolese student was not im-
mediate. Although the commit-
tee and the college. along with
the Board of World Mission
considered several possible
candidates, in particular a boy
then taking some high school
cavurcas in New Jerecev na can.

Nzenga had for the year pre-
vious to his admission been
taking a post -high scnoo!
course in the United States
and had been perfecting his
English at a language insti-
tute over the summer.

Rhodes indicated that the in-
tervening year and a_ half
since the Board of Trustees
first took action had served
as a cooling off period for the
college and community. Nzen-
gu ‘‘came into a fairly normal
situation,” Rhodes said.

Integration at Davidson was
not marked by any incidents.
“The student body as a whole
took this calmly, and there
was not a single ‘un-nice’ inci-
dent on this campus,"’ Rhodes
said.

Rhodes noted that in early
days, before and just after in-

a student from Davidson be-
cause of his race.

At this meeting the Trustees
were presented with the re-
sults of a faculty and student
po}l on the subject of integra-
tion. The faculty had voted 53-
14 in favor of admitting any
qualified student regardless of
race. With 59 per cent of the
Student Body voting, 53 per
cent of the students casting
votes were in favor of lifting
further restrictions in regard
to integration.

On May 17, 1962, the Board
of Trustees voted to open the
college to students regardless
of race or nationality. Dr. J.
McDowell Richards, then
chairman of the Board of Trus-
tees, characterized that voting
as “‘not close at all.”

Thus by the time that inte-

ation came to Davidson, the

son.

In summarizing the work
that had gone into the prepa-
ration for the integration of
the college. Rhodes reflected
that ‘‘concern for the boys, not
so much for the school’s im-
age" had motivated the work
of the Congolese Committee.

Taking a long view at the
process of integration, calm-
ness and anticipation seem to
be characteristic, although
there have been some inci-
dents in which merchants have
been reluctant to or have re-
fused to serve Negro students.

Some derogatory mail has
been received by Negro stu-
dents here, but these have
been widely spaced incidents.

In a survey of businesses in
the town of Davidson patron-

ized by college students, THE
DAVIDSONIAN reported in
February, 1961, that the ma-
jority opinion of the business-
men was that “they won't
serve them,” in reference to
the possibility of having a Ne-
gro student at Davidson.

In a September, 1963, DA-
VIDSONIAN article, four busi-
nesses in the town of David-
son stated that they were open
to all, regardless of race.

In summarizing the race re-
lation situation today, Rhodes
pointed out that “the interest
of federal and state govern-
ment, and the interest that the
church has taken in problems
of race relations, all of these
things have in a sense come
together and are bearing good
fruit.”

tion to the dilemma.

The solution to Job’s problem
is in the personage of Christ of
the New Testament. For Christ
is “bone of our bone, and flesh
of our flesh." He is one like us.

Kelly said of Christ, “Here is
one who really understands His
oneness with God." It is through
Him that man finds that rela-
tionship to God.

Probing the problem of death,
Kelly asked the question, ‘‘Be-
yond all suffering, is there some
hope?" The basis of the New
Testament, he said, is the belief
that there is life after death.

In the light of this knowledge
of the answer to the question of
life after death, Kelly recom-
mended, “‘Take up your cross."
