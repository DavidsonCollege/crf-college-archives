Red and Black Defeats
Wofford Eleven Easily

On Muddy Field, Davidson Comes
Out Winner, 34 to 0.

Playing on a muddy field and with
the wind blowing fiercely, Davidson
ploughed thru the Wofford Methodists
for a comparatively easy victory last
Thursday afternoon at Spartanburg, S.
C. The final score was 34 to 0.

From the start the outcome was never
in doubt, and the Wofford team was
kept almost continually on the defensive.
While both teams were seemingly even-
ly matched as to weight, the superior
training and speed of the Red and Black
“machine™ had a telling effect. Coach
Fetzer made several substitutions during
the game and this reserve strength show-
ed no lessening of the team’s speed and
drive.

As usual, “Billy” Sayad played a spec-
tacular game in the line, while “Jack”
Black was the principal ground gainer,
altho all the men responded with sub-
stantial gains when called upon. David-
son made 14 first downs during the play
and gained approximately 200 yards.

The first quarter was scoreless, vet
Davidson made five first downs during
the period. The half ended with Dav-
‘idson 21 points to the good, however.
with two touchdowns credited to Black
and one to Flowers, Grey kicking goal
each time. In the third quarter Singleton
added another six points to Davidson's
total, while Mackorell made the other
touchdown in the final quarter, Gres
kicking goal. The touchdowns wer
made for the most part on straight line
plunges. ,

The following was the line-up:

Connell gave one of the reeular semi-

ing and profitable one to the first-vear
men. In the course of the lecture Dr.
McConnell stated that there were more
cases of sickness among the Freshmen
than among the other three classes com-
bined, due to carelessness in the care of
their health. He explained how a great
many diseases were caused by had teeth

vented. He ‘then took up a discussion
of some minor diseases and explained

Football Season Ends
With Game Tomorrow

Davidson Meets Clemson in Char-
lotte Eor Final Contest.

Davidson taces tomorrow her final
game of the season, and one of her hard-
est, when she goes up against the strong
Clemson eleven. Early in the season
Clemson was handicapped by — injuries
and unfavorable playing conditions, but
these have been overcome, and the team
has made remarkable improvement dur-
ing November. “Phey are coming te
Charlotte confident of victory. How-
ever, Coach Fetzer’s warriors will have
something to say before the game is de-
cided, and the contest will be a hard
fought one thruout. Davidson’s games
with Clemson in the past have always
heen of the thrilling kind, and indica-
tions point that this year’s game will be
no exception. Since the two teams have
heen meeting on the gridiron, Clemson
was won three contests, Davidson two,
while three have heen tied. The scores
for the eight games are as follows:

1900—Clemsun 65; Davidson, 0.

1906—Clemson, 0: Davidson. o.

1907—Clemson 6; Davidson, 10.

1908—Clemson, 0; Davidson, 13.

1909—Clemson, 17; Davidson, 5.
1913—Clemson. 6; Davidson, 3.
1914—Clemson, 0; Davidson, o.
1915—Clemson, 6; Davidson. 6.

Tt is honed that the entire Student
Body will he at Wearn Field tomorrow,
to. back their team in this last game of a
memorable season. This will be the
final game for several of the Red and
Black stars, including the two Whites,
Sayad, “Steve” Walker, and Laird, and
the students should see these men in
action once more.

In order to accommadate the students
a special train will be run to Charlotte
at 9:30 a. m., and leaving Charlotte on
the return tomorrow night at 12 o'clock.
The round trip will be 80 cents. The
regular admission to the game will be
one dollar, but as usual Davidson stu-

dents may purchase tickets on the Hill

for so cents, in 16 Chambers.

The Orchestra and Glee Club .will
give a concert at Queens College to-
morrow night, following which there
will be a reception. to which all David-

Tt is hoped that Davidson vi move
to Charlotte tomerrow “with bells on.”
