Let's go to Spain, speak Espanol, jog, etc.

By MARLO COBB

I went to Spain for the fall
semester with Middlebury
College. My purpose was to
continue the seemingly end-
less process of improving my
Spanish. I chose Madrid
mainly for its cultural advan-
tages and large size (close to 5
million people).

Spain was under a dictator-
ship until November of 1975,
and it will join the EEC in 1992.
The country is now undergo-
ing a self-improvement proc-
ess in Order to meet the stan-
dards of the EEC.

Contrary to what apears to
be popular opinion, Spain is
not inexpensive. It used to be,
in the 1970s, but since then the
dollar has fallen. Spanish
goods are thus now relatively
more expensive than they
were in the 70s.

Traffic in Madrid is a major

problem. The streets are nar-
row to begin with, and people
double park all the time. No-
body hesitates to use his horn,
especially at 8 a.m. Motor-
cycles are also much more
popular in Spain than at home.
Madrid is a noisy, crowded
city during the day, but the
night life compensates for that.
Anevening my friends liked to
call “Typical Eh-spanish”
would start after a 10:00 p.m.
dinner. It moved on to 14liter or
even 3-liter beers, a disco or
two between 2:00 and 5:00.a.m.
From there, we would move to
a “jamoneria” for a late night
snack (breakfast?). The eve-
ning would culminate at 6:30 or
7:00 a.m. ina “chocolateria” for
hot chocolate, fried doughnut
sticks, and good conversation.
Then, of course, we would
sleep until 3:00 p.m. that day,
which in Spain is lunchtime!

Spanish guys have a stere-
Otype for all “Americanas”:
blond and fat. Atthesametime,
they think of all Americans as
very athletic. We are consid-
ered a friendly people in com-
parison with the British, who
are considered to be cold and
aloof. Spaniards also think that
Americans dress rather slop-
pily, and compared with them,
we really do. Outward appear-
ance is very important to the
Spanish.

Although itis true that some
of the population has dark hair
and eyes, there is a pretty wide
range of looks that are truly
“Spanish”. Many Spaniards
did not recognize that I was a
foreigner until I opened my
mouth. Sometimes I’d be
stopped on the street and asked

_ for directions. I’d have to say

(in heavily accented Spanish),
“I don’t know where that street

through the rest of the show:

My nationality was obvi-
ous, however, when I decided
to dress down. A sweatshirt is
blatantly American on the
streets of Madrid, and so are
shorts, for which guys will get
stares and girls will get
whistles and comments.

radio time, they ranked up
there with (or surpassed) Span-

good. The Spanish try at rap,
however, is a different story!

Besides Madrid, I was able
to visit Luarca (a coastal town
in the province of Asturias, to
the north), Barcelona, Cor-
doba, Granada and Sevilla. I
would definitely recommenda
semester abroad for anyone
who is considering it, but I’m
alsoreally glad to be back in the
US:!

lustrative of this valuable in-
trospection. The show, which
is entitled “Contemporary
Icons and Explorations,” will
continue through March 11.
The exhibit of over 75 paint-
ings, sculptures and mixed-
media constructions roughly
covering the last two decades,
offers a poignant look at major
currents of contemporary
thought. One of the themes that
is most apparent in the show is
the anxiety, collective and psy-

fested itself in several forms.
Perhaps the most literal of

these is Bill Kane’s mixed-

media assemblage entitled
Boom. A corroded image of a
mushroom cloud hovers overa
field of menacing black void, il-
luminated only by an acidic red
neon cross and the word
“Boom” below. Hidden dis-
cretely beneath the rubble of
the image is the ironic expres-
sion “Nice!”.

By his use of photographic

: eras are an
ever-present reminder of the
distrust that lies behind such
“freedom.”

The questions of self-identity

and spiritual renewal in a —

world of cutthroat consumer-
ism are explored in the work of
Christophe Boutin and Alan
Greenberg. Boutin uses refer-
ences to the mythical process of
alchemy to Suggest moral re-
birth (“Sans Titre [Cones]”
