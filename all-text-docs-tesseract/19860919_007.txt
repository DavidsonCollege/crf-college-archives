Last Saturday the Davidson
soccer team started the week with
a 6-1 pounding of Winthrop ‘inthe
first round ‘of the Davidson:UCB
Tournament, They | ifell in the fi-
nals to Belmont ' Abbey, 1-0.
Wednesday lost at Duke, 6-
0. a .
Davidson’s record on the sea-
son dropped to 1-5-1.

‘The Winthrop game started
tentatively as the teams probed
each other’s defenses. Winthrop
opened the scoring in the sixth mi-
nute when an Eagle fullback
scored on a direct free kick at the
edge of the penalty box. _

Davidson equalized in ‘the
19th minute as junior Michael
Spear easily converted a penalty
kick.

With the score tied at 1-1, the
team settled down and started to
control the game. Sophomore
midfielder Tracy Hankins scored

the game-winning goal in the 26th .

minute of the first half. A comer
kick from senior fullback Steve
Stith found Hankins in front of the
foal, who sent the Winthrop
goalie in search of the’ ‘ball at the
back of the net.

Junior midfielder Steve Omli
opened the scoring in the second
half with the goal of the game. At
22:00, Omli found himself with
the ball at the center line. Doing a
Maradonna impersonation, he
dribbled the ball through the

Hankins scored his secind
goal just eight minutes later. He
sent the ball home after it re-
bounded off of the goalie on junior

stopping several dangerous shots.
He also had some help from his-
goalposts and a fullback as they

him.

Friedlander was also involved
with the sixth goal at the 39th mi-
nute of the second half. He pushed
the ball past a diving goalie at the
edge of the penalty box and
freshman midfielder Rocky Fresh
scored the open net goal. _ -

Davidson’ totally dominated

the play throughout the game. The
ball rarely left the Winthrop end of
the field in the second half. “We
played a good game and really
spread things out,” Friedlander
said. —

The sharp, crisp passing and
patiently developed play was fi-
nally complemented with a qual-
ity finishing game.

Events did not pass quite as
well in Sunday’s 1-0 loss to Bel-
mont Abbey. The only goal came
in the 27th minute of the game as a
Crusader midfielder scored after a
long pass.

Again Davidson dominated
the game, but had poor luck in,
front of the goal. The Abbey-goal-
keeper played an excellent game,

goal disallqwed on a controversial
call. A long throw-in squirted
through a group of players to the
left of the ggaimouth to find Fried-
lander in the center, “I couldn't
kick the ball or it would go straight
to the goalie,” Friedlander said,
“so I used my knee to push it in
and the goalie dove at me.”

The ball went in the goal but
‘the linésman’s flag went up and
the referee called the goal back.
The ruling: someone kicked the
goalie. No goal. Davidson lost.

Wednesday the team traveled
to Durham to take on Duke, who
is ranked ninth in the nation. The
Blue Devils lived up to their repu-
tation as they dominated the
Wildcats, 6-0. Davidson could
never find their rhythm and
looked flat on the field compared
to the fast, talented Duke squad.

The team next hosts William
and Mary tomorrow at 2 p.m.
They then open conference play

against Appalachian State one

Sept. 24. The players are hoping
to do better.

“I’m sure we’ll pick it up this
weekend,” Hankins said. “We can
win the next three games if we
start with a win on Saturday.”

Field hockey opens season on disappointing note

By PAM HARMANN

The Davidson field hockey
team’s 6-0 loss to Wake Forest
was an example of first game
nervousness. The young, inex-
perienced squad was intimidated
by a much improved Wake Forest
team, whose excellent stick work
makes them 4 much stronger teani
than in previous years.

__ Davidson played very defen-
sively and lacked aggressiveness.
Their first game jitters made them
timid and hesitant to play the ball.

Wake Fovest’s first goal was a,

penalty stroke about five minutes
into the first half. This added to
the intimidation and Wake would
score three more goals in the first
half.

Davidson had no offensive
pressure_and obvious difficulty in
getting the ball over the 50-yard
line.

The second half was.a definite
improvement over the first, with
Wake scoring only. two goals.
Freshman forward Christy Sloan
led the front line. Senior sweeper

Heather McKee led the defense
throughout the game and sparked
the-team to play more aggres-
sively. She was hélped by junior
halfback Mandy Barrett.

Coach Betsy Pryor feels the
squad needs a lot of work on fun-
damentals. “We must play our
game and not sit back and see
what the other team does.”

. It must be noted that Davidson,
had only: one substitute: the alter.
nate goalie. Injuries have plagued
the team, temporarily removing

senior halfback Polly Northen and
sophomore forward Heather
Fitzpatrick. There were also three
players who had made the travel-
ing squad but were ineligible in
Wednesday’s.game due to NCAA
paperwork. They are sophomores
Kris Kost, Tyler Smith, and Kim
White. They. should be eligible by
this weekend.

In regard to the game, Heather
McKee said, “The first game is
not a good indication of the poten-
tial this team has. The game
against Salem should be a much

better contest.”

Looking ahead, Pryor said, “1
hope to see a turnaround because
they shouldn’t be as nervous.
They were very intimidated by
Wake. We should have our confi-
dence back by the games this
weekend.”

Salem comes to Davidson Fri-
day for a 4 p.m. game. On Satur-
.day Davidson meets Eastern Ken-
tucky University here at 11 a.m.
This shouid be the toughest game
of the season. Coach Pryor hopes
Davidson will rise to the occasion.

Volleyball debuts with two matches at home

The women’s volleyball team,

the night, the Lady Cats quickly

points and although Davidson |

service through several Wildcat

The next game started badly
for the Lady Cats. They let.
Lenoir-Rhyne score seven un-
answered points before jumping
into the game. Through careful as-

fense, the Cats gradually gained
points and cut the lead to 9-5. The
two teams then proceded to trade

points until the score reached 13-

With _Lenoir-Rhyne
points from victory the Wildcats
showed that they have heart as
well as talent. They held off three
attempts by the Bears and scored
once to bring the score to 14-9. Fi-
nally, Lénoir-Rhyne scored to win
the game.

Davison’s women’s  vol-
leyball team is young and has‘not
played as a team for very long, but
it has lots of enthusiasm and even
in-its losses improved. In the fu-

‘ture Women’s volleyball should be

very exciting. The next home
game. is Sept. 30.
