Close Successful Season

_ “'Eleven Seniors Graduate

“We all wish we were sophomores.

'From Smith’s First Squad

” Thus Jim Terry described the attitude of

the eleven seniors who composed the nucleus of the ’65 ’Cats. They brought David-

FOOTBALL ... AT LAST son its first winning season since 1958 and won the magic six for the first time in

The steel-gray Saturday skies are quiet now.
And winter’s icy winds whistle through lonely goal
posts that stand silent on brown grass.

Throaty cheers and loud shouts ‘have turned to
the crowded warmth of a floodlighted gymnasium,
the cheers and shouts have turned from the thump of

ad against pad to the thump of leather against a
hardwood court. The cheers and shouts have left
Davidson’s empty football stadium for the first time
in nearly a decade, but now we know, not the last.

For this year, unlike the recent past, there were
cheers and shouts, for this year, unlike the recent
ast, redthroated fans hollared themselves hoarse
in a packed stadium; for this year, unlike the recent
past, Davidson played footbail.

A new coach, Homer Smith, brought a new staff,
Dick Tomey, Dave Fagg and Ken Blair, and broke
an old tradition with his new look.

Material-wise another bleak season loomed
ahead. At best this year's squad was weaker than
last year’s, hurt by the loss of such key personnel
as Steve Heckard, Pat Fisher, Will Jackson, Jay
Rogers and Bruce Dalton, Smith’s new look was
forced to rely on untried sophomores, green Jun-
iors, a nucleus of seniors, tough, but used to losing,
and student excitement that reached a bored yawn

eleven years.

But their record isn’t really
that important. The seniors led
a team who established ‘’a new
way of playing football,” as
Coach Homer Smith likes to
phrase it. ‘It was a tough tran-
sition to make,"’ commented
linebacker Dick Short, ‘‘espe-
cially for the seniors.”

“We really had to shift gears,”
added Jim Rollins, ‘Everything
was different.”

Hindsley began his football

at its peak.

But armed with a handful of new and unusual
weapons, these untried sophomores, green Juniors,

and supposedly

“defeatist’ seniors came through

magnificently. Their arsenal was meager on the sur-

face, and at Jeast to their first three op onents, Pres-
Furman and The Citadel, they were still

the same old losers.

Smith gave them enthusiasm and confidence, almost

to the point of the absurd.

erans, maybe even stars, Billy Taylor, Walter Greene,
Tommy Caldwell, Pete Glidewell, George Solley,
Ken Kendall, Buddy Newsome and Tupper Morehead
took up more than the slack last year’s seniors left.

The green juniors stepped into last year’s holes
without breaking stride. Jimmy Poole and Jake
Jacobsen alternated at quarterback and sparked the
offense to the most points scored by a Davidson team
since 1956. Renn Gruber, Tommy Dews, Johnny
Walker, Julian Fite, John Fagg, Bill Rikard and Joe
Gaddy had flashes of greatness that promise even
more successes for next year’s Smith team.

The tough seniors were just that. Forgetting
our hallowed heritage of unsure, sloppy, lackadaisi-
cal playing Pack Hindsley and Dave Sprinkle were
All-Conference selections; Steve Smith, Jim Terry,
John Little, Jerry Blackstock, Dick Short, Woody
Hill, Stu Perry, Jim Rollins and Mike Cummings
gave maturity and leadership to a team, when by all
past experience Davidson seniors should have been
the epitime of the lazy yawn called Davidson spirit.

But the real miracle in Davidson football came
in the stands, not on the field. Smith and his cohorts
broke the placid sea of silence that has hung over
Davidson football games since the fifties. The sar-
castic snickers that once were the only audible
sounds at a Davidson game were turned into excited
chatter and enthusiastic roars. Even the usual
cynicism that we splatter on our sports pages has
been somewhat silenced.

People will: tell you now we could have done
better; we should have been 7-3; don’t listen. Only
the most optimistic of foolish fans would have hoped
for the 6-4 record this year’s team brought us.

But Smith brought Davidson much more than
six wins. He brought Davidson football. And he
brought enough excitement for us to say the throaty
cheers and loud shouts have left our gridiron, but
they will be back.

To Begin Season

Co-captain Jim Stokes and
several sophomores lead David-
son's swimming team in twelve
meets this year, the first being
against Virginia here Monday.

This is Coach Tom Stevens's
first year as Davidson swim-

ter safety classes for the physi-
cal education department and he
coached a competitive team
from the Pine Lake Country
Club one summer.

The team, selected by the

Davidson didn’t get the breaks
in that game as they had in
previous contests, having to
drive 79 and 80 yards for the
two scores. In the first eight
games, they were able to score
every time but one when they

Coach Smith remarked on the

it was the biggest thrill we
have had in sports. We didn’t

more year before switching to
a defensive end slot in 1964.

Although Hindsley has won
other awards, including honor-
able mention All-Scholastic and
All-Southern Conference team
last year and Southern Confer-
ence ‘lineman of the week" this
year, he said. “This selection
is a real honor, and it is prob-

‘ ably what I've been working

toward all through my football
career here.”

Sprinkle began playing foot-
ball in the tenth grade of high
school and has played a defen-
sive backfield position ° ever
since, with the exception of his
freshman year at Davidson,
when he played on both offense
and defense. His defensive play

’ attracted note last year and he

received the LaFar defensive
award, but he grinned and said,
“TI was really thrilled by the
selection: like Pack. I'd say
it was something I've been work-
ing toward for a long time.”
Both Hindsley and Sprinkle
are also active in extracurricu-
lar activities. Hindsley, a pre-
medicine major, is a Distin-
guished Military Student, a
member of Scabbard and Blade,
a member of Phi Gamma Delta
social fraternity, and a listee
in Who's Who in American Col-
feges and Universities.
Sprinkle is also a DMS and a
member of Scabbard and Blade

slots, Stu Perry played tackle.
and John Little served both
backfield and spread end duty
when not hampered by a shoul-
der injury. Steve Smith led the
offensive unit from his fullback
position.

Dick Short called the signals
from his linebacking position.
Captain Pack Hindsley, Mike
Cummings, and Jim Rollins fill-
ed out the defensive line, while
Dave Sprinkle paced the secon-
dary. Jim Terry proved that
he was the best kicker in the
conference for the third straight
year,

Out of this eleven, Hindsley
and Sprinkle were named to the
All-Conference first team, and
Hill and Smith were given berths
on the second team. Coach
Smith also pointed out that

Hindsley and Terry are definite-.

ly pro prospects.

It is not enough, however,
to talk about their ability alone.
As sophomore anchor man Tup-
per Morehead stated, ‘‘The sen-
iors were terrific leaders on the
field. Their spirit helped the
whole team.”

Undoubtedly, the seniors’
greatest admirer was Coach
Smith himself. When. asked
about them, he said, ‘‘I couldn’t
talk about one or two without
naming them all, they were
great.” He added, ‘We played
bigger, faster and more experi-
enced teams, and won because
the boys worked harder.’

Although justifiably proud of
the season as a whole, the sen-
fors were all slightly disappoint-

ed. “This was our best year,”
said Rollins, ‘We hustled all
the time, our organization was
better, we just did everything
better. But we should have won
more games.”

Short observed that the team
never put together a perfect
game. ‘There was always some- —
thing that we didn’t do as well
as we should have,’ he com-
mented.

In talking to the seniors, how-
ever, one thing is readily no-
ticeable, they never credit them-
selves with this team’s success.
Instead, when asked what made
the difference this year, the an-
wer is inevitably ‘‘Homer.” As
Jim Rollins pointed out, “It was ~
our best season, but it was due
to Coach Smith.”

Terry added, ‘The coaches
worked our butts off, but they
were four great guys. You want-
ed to work for them.”

Blackstock summed up the
team’s feeling when he said,
“The potential has always been
there. There have been games
in the past that we should have
won but didn’t. This year we
wanted to win for ourselves, but
mostly for Homer. He’s great.”

Perhaps the greatest indica-
tion of the seniors’ enthusiasm,
however, js the attitude they
have for the future of Davidson
football. They talk about next
year’s squad as being the best
ever, and the difference a good
recruiting program is going to
make. Short best typified the
team's optimism when he stat-
ed, ‘In the near future, a 64
season may be disappointing.”
