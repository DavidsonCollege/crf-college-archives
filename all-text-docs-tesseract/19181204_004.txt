A CAMPUS FALLACY
DISPROVED

By Henry Louis SmitH

President of Washington and Lee
University.

The proverbs or maxims of a people
generally represent the wisdom of long
experience. They are sign-boards on
life’s great highway erected by former
generations, and most travelers accept
their guidance without question. As a
false sign on a crowded roadway may
lead multitudes astray, so an untrue miax-
im, especially when circulating among
the young and inexperienced, may turn
countless lives into dangerous or fatal
paths. “Every young man must sow his
wild oats,” “All's fair in love and war,”
“Every man has his price,” are examples
of such lying proverbs.

Our boys and -girls, inexperienced
travelers on a new road, eager to be in
the fashion, untaught as yet by hard ex-
perience, are casily misled by current
fallacies and false traditions, especially
if the falsehood is sugar-coated with
a little truth and its acceptance furnishes
a ready excuse for laziness or misconduct.

‘To this doubly dangerous class be-
longs the oft-repeated and widely-be-
lieved statement that the boy who leads
his class in school is generally a failure
in after life. Here is the lying tradition
sweetened with a little truth and fla-
vored with counterfeit logic:

“To attain success in the fierce war-
fare of modern business demands pluck,
self-confidence, red-blooded vitality, and
a knowledge of men and things, rather
than ‘book-learning’ and abstract schol-
arship.\In fact, the students who make
the very highest grades are. not so aph
to win promotion and success in later life
as their wiser comrades who refuse to
spend more time in study than is neces-
sary to nake reasonably fair grades, and
are thereby enabled to participate more
vigorously in the social and athletic ac-
tivities of the playground and campus.”

To the lazy and self-indulgent, to so-
cial dudes and tin-horn sports and over-
grown children, to all who long to stuty
less and play more, this theory is as
fascinating as poisoned candy in a kin-
dergarten. It not only excuses neglect
of duty but crowns the loafer as a man
of far-seeing wisdom. Ie is a .timely
opiate wher conscience stirs within, a
trusty armor when parents and teachers
assail from without.

What wonder that in many student
circles it is the most unquestioned part
of the college creed and campus opinion
looks down with mingled pity and con-
tempt on “‘studes”, “digs”, “grinds,”
and “scholarship cranks.”

The truth is that those who outstrip
their indolent or brainless competitors
in school or college continue to do so
when school days are over, and to win
high schotarship honors in a_ first-class
college is almost a guarantee of success
in life.

To prove this let us take only one of
many impartial investigations.

In 1911, Dr. Paul Van Dyke made
a careful study of the scholarship rec-
ords and future history of nearly 9,000
graduates of five typical colleges to sec
how many of them had attained such
prominence as to be placed in the
“Who's Who” list of distinguished
Americans, published every other year
by Marquis and Company, of Chicago.
Other similar studies had shown that of
the two million Americans who never
attended school, none attained the
“Who's Who” list; of those with a com-
mon-school education, it took 9,000 to
furnish one distinguished man; of those
with high-school training, one in 400

Dr. Van Dyke's study of the Harvard
ecords covered 13 successive senior
lasses, numbering 2,229 men, of whom
nly 75 won the very highest scholar-
ship honors. Of these 75, 59 were liv-
ing in 1911, and 27 of them were listed
‘n “Who's Who" of that year, about
1 in 2.

At Yale, 20 senior classes numbered

Princeton's seniors for 20 years, num-
sering 1,687, furnished 100 hondr-men.
Of these 76 were living in 1gi1, with
29 in “Who's Who.” -

Amherst College in) 17 years fur-
nished 1,153 Seniors and 106 honor-
men. Of the 80 living in 1911, 25 had
reached distinction.

Brown University in 15 years had
778 Seniors, of whom 60 won first-
honor. Of these there were 53 living
in 1911, and tg were listed in ‘‘Who's
Who.”

‘Thus among 7,979 men, having ‘all
the advantages of modern college train-
ing, representing five institutions and
85 vraduating classes, 348 (4 per cent)
were differentiated from the rest solely
by their very high grades. While this
group were still below middle age, and
79 of them too young to have had a
fair chance to win distinction, 131 (1
in every 2 2-3) had already won a
place on the “Who's Who” list of dis-
tinguished men which contains only 1-55
of ¢ per cent of the total population.
Omitting the 79, one-half of the req
mainder were already on the "Who's
Who" list in 1gti.

‘To sum it up from another point of
view: The man who graduates with
high scholastic honors, instead of being
unfitted for success by his extra ‘“book-
learning,” is about seven times as likely
to become a distinguished man as the
“all-round men" taking their diplomas
with him, As compared with the aver-
age college student his chances are 20
to 1; compared with the average high-
schoo! student 200 to 1; and with those
having only a common-school education
5,000 to 1. In this Age of Mind, as
never before, Knowledge is Power, and
the man who énows is the man who
leads.

‘The next time, therefore, the silly
falsehood that star students generally
fail in business threatens to become epi-
demic on your campus, kindly inoculate
the “easy marks” with the above facts
and arrest the spread of the contagion.

In past years Davidson has been
noted for the spirit of democracy and
fellowship which has existed among her
students. Wherever two or more Da-
vidson men met there was a_ friendly
greeting; name made no difference for
they were bound together by a band of
college spirit. Conditions this year are
different. As far as the majority of the
fellows are concerned there is little
time for the college activities which for-
merly bound the students together. The
result is that the old spirit of unity has
given way ina large measure to a
spirit of factionalism. Now the men no
longer greet each other when they meet
on the campus unless they happen to be
friends. There is more call for friend-
ship among the men now than ever.
All the men are facing problems that
they have never had to face before. Fur-
thermore, only by a spirit of cooperation
can the best be gotten out of the S. A.
T. C. here. It takes very little effort
to say “Gentlemen” or some such greet-
ing as you meet the fellows on the
campus or down town and it helps all
to pull together for the benefit of them-
selves and the college—S. O. L.

The two literary societies will meet
at 7:15 on Saturday night to discuss
plans for beginning active work imme-
diately on the resumption of college
after Christmas. Several medals for
oratory, debating, and literary ability
are offered by each society in the spring
term. These should be keenly contest-
ed. Then, it is expected that the soci-
eties will arrange two intercollegiate
debates, according to old custom. All

COLLEGE EXPENSES OF THE
SPRING TERM.

The regular college expenses for the
spring term will be as is prescribed by
the catalog.

“The fees at the opening of the term
will ‘range from $79.00 to $66.00. This
variation is due to the choice in dormi-

tories made by the buarding houses this]:

"There will be a certain amount needed

for incidentals, but the fellows must
remember that the Government will
cease paying board and $30 a month,

The other day |
Gor to talking
With a fellow,
A big, rough, loud private
He was—
Or rather he had been.
You see, he was just back
_ From France and
He had only one leg
Left to stand on,
He left the other one
Near a little French
Place they call
Chateau Thierry,
But he didn't seem
To mind it much.
Anyway, we got to talking about the
war and
Some other things; one of
Them was the relative
Size of transport boats;
And I said, “They tell me
This big boat, the Leviathan,
Has carried more soldiers over than
any other
Boat.” He looked at
Me a minute and grinned
A funny kind of grin. Then
He said, “Naw, buddy, you're:
All wrong: The Lusitania
Carried most. of them.”
It took me a full
Minute to get this and
Then | started wondering
If I had enough
Money to buy another Thrift Stamp.
