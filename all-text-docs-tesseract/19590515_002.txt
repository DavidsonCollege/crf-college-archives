Labor: An End, Not A Means?

One of the problems that it is
necessary for a Davidson student to
have an opinion on is labor. Most of
us don’t.

Therefore it is within the context
of the accomplishment of the Great
Issues program that we speak. Their
final series of what has become a
successful institution on campus after
one year of work speaks well for it.

The conflict between such men as
Mr. Dillard and Mr. Payton is not
personal. It is on the higher plane of
what one man has learned from life
versus another.

The DAVIDSONJAN wants to
speak only for itself in this matter,
but it feels a deep need to give a
statement on labor-management re-
lations. It must speak within its en-
vironment, which obviously colors its
opinion. We side with Mr. Dillard.

The points which were adequate-
ly represented, if not completely de-
veloped, by Mr. Payton are, nonethe-
less, essentially valid. Labor Unions
have historic (if not present) justi-
fication. The present labor movement
is clearly valid in urging considera-
tion of what it supports. We do not
argue this.

In our days. organized labor has
become an end in itself rather than
a means to the greater good of the
worker. The situation in the steel in-
dustry today reveals this. An inde-
pendent, respected surveyer has
found that the steel worker does not

want a strike under any conditions,
that he would rather keep .his pres-
ent wages than go on strike. But the
Steelworker’s Union is demanding in
New York more money or a strike.

The export situation of the Unit-

Fraternity Nepotism Seen On Davi

' ternal

ed States is deteriorating, because of '

its high-wage costs and constrictive
labor-practices which have torn-apart
the railroad industry and could strike
others.

The pendulum has swung back re-
versing the historic roles in labor-
management disputes. Management
is now the underdog. The general
public is the not-too-infrequent loser.

Mr. Dillard speaks not for destroy-
ing organized labor, nor for freezing
it arbitrarily. He speaks for creating
a situation in which higher considera-
tions than the immediate moment can
be the concern.

The textile industry is internally
and externally competitive. A mono-
polistic union of the same stature as
the autoworkers could dictate more
than policy. Perhaps the TWUA does
not aspire to be such, but this it must
prove for our comfort before it has
the opportunity, not after.

Labor has done much in the past
for its workers. Despite the Hoffas it
is not essentially sick today. It is not
without fault, however, and it is
necessary to see and eliminate this.

Progress, however, is not always
labor’s most important product.

Redemption

Last week THE DAVIDSONIAN
proposed that a man dismissed from
school for an honor violation could
be considered for readmission after a
period of two years.

The Honor Court met Thursday
morning to consider a detailed pro-
posal by Dean Bailey which is very
similar. The Court heartily approved
the plan and it went to the faculty
this afternoon for further discussion.

Under Dean Bailey’s proposal a
man who is dismissed from school
for an honor violation. could apply:
after two years for readmission. A
faculty committee yyould investigate
the nature of the offense and the con-
duct of the applicant since his dis-
missal. Any recommendation left by
the Court which tried the case would
also be given careful consideration. It
would then be the faculty’s decision
as to whether or not the student could
return.

The value of such a plan would be
to give another chance to a man who,
although he broke the letter of the
law, did not intend to violate its spirit,
in the opinion of the Court. Such
cases do arise.

To allow a man the opportunity
to return and prove himself better
for his experience would be in the
spirit of a church school.

A Helping Hand

We note with interest and approv-
al that philanthropist Charles A. Dana
has again extended a monetary help-
ing hand to the South. His $360,000
challenge gift to Queens College,
similar to the one he gave here a
year ago, carries the same stipula-

tion: that it be matched with an equal
amount to be raised by Queens of-
ficials and friends.

Although not for as explicit a pur-
pose as Davidson’s science hall (half
of the Queens grant is to go into gen-
eral endowment), the donation shows
another contribution to the trend that
Northern philanthropists have enough
interest and confidence in the grow-
ing Southern educational system as
to consider such a grant a good in-
vestment.

We hope that the trend will con-
tinue.

Davidson 500?

It appears that some of our stu-
dents, fascinated by the powers of
automation, have decided that the
drive around Patterson Fraternity
Court sufficiently resembles the Dar-
lington Speedway so as to be used for
the same purpose.

Especially at meal times many of
the proud owners of the various au-
tomobiles on campus (usually those
who are fortunate enough to possess
newer models or some make of for-
eign car) decide to show off their
mechanical prowess and zoom around
the court.

It has been reported by one proud
“driver?” that he “can hit sixty miles
an hour in front of the Beta house.”

We would like to remind our stu-
dent drivers that it has been college
policy to erect speed bumps in areas
in which there has been excessive
speeding.

So unless some students desire a
bevy of these man made mole hills
scattered inconveniently around the
court, we suggest that some of the
loca) dare-devils trade in their check-
ered flags for safer speeds.

By ED STEVENS

(Editor’s note: The material
in this article is adapted from
a lengthy statistical survey
made recently by Senior Ed
Stevens. A set of statistical
tables supporting his findings
was omitted because of lack
of space.)

An investigation of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN reveals strikingly
the extent to which one’s fra-
affiliations affect his
ability to rise to positions of
leadership on the Davidson Col-
lege Campus.

PAST YEARS

In the period from 1948-52,
seventy per cent of the staff
offices were filled by members
of four fraternities—Phi Delta
Theta, Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa
Alpha, and Kappa Alpha.

Over an eleven year period
there was a tendency for the
figures to balance out, as pow-
er switched from fraternity to
fraternity. Even so, we find
that fifty-four per cent of the
key posts were filled by men
from four fraternities—Kappa

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:

Queens, Converse Girls
Reply To Recent Jibes

{Editor’s Note: A_ recent
article by freshman George
Trask, on the attitudes of Da-
vidson students to surround-
ing girls’ schools, brought
angry repties. Below are
printed two letters: the first
attacking the statement that
“most Queens girls are pigs,”
and the second answering the
charge thet “all Converse
girls are country girls.”)

Dear Editor:

In view of a recent article
in the DAVIDSONIAN'S Spring
Frolics Issue, we find it neces-
sary to set the ‘Davidson
Gentlemen” straight on a few
matters.

Sitting smugly in the mid-
dle of Queens, Hollins, Selem,
Converse, Suilins, St. Mary's,
Sweetbrier, Randolph-Macon,
WwW. C., Mary Baldwin, and
Agnes Scott, Davidson men
seem to think they are God's
gift to women and can sit in
judgment on these schools.

It is time this smug little
school got the other side of the
story and took a look at itself.

the term loosely) ere com

naughty and “earthy” when
they manfully get softy(sic—
Ed.) on a few beers or tell
of all their adventures with
the opposite sex—the source
of these adventures coming
from cheap newsstand maga-
zines.

They consider themselves
worldly and well-traveled when
they have gone as far as
Mooresville.

Yet these seme creatures,
holding their black umbrel-
las, graduate not knowing e
thing of life and continue
their simple, innocent way at
Union Theological Seminary
or at some “wild” med school.
To centralize these com-

plaints let us discuss the matter
of the “pigs” at Queens:

Several of the whitewashed
-Davidson gentlemen must want
to gain experience by wallow-
ing in the pig pen with the pigs.
At any rate, a fair number of
them travel the road to Char-
lotte on weekends.

These dates are given out
of the kindness of the Queens
girts’ hearts because West
Point, Annepolis, Princeton,
Vale. and Harvard can’t man-
age to come down for week-
ends. (siek—Ed.)

To the immature, childish be-
havior of the fairy boys at Da-
vidson, Queens and the other
above-mentioned schools reply:

KEY POSTS

We might also note that ov-
er the eleven year period,
twenty-eight key posts have
been filled by men of the Edi-
tor’s fraternity, while only one
hundred and five have come
from all other groups. If mere
chdnce were responsible, this
would occur less than che time
out of one hundred.

Similarly, we see that a great
preponderance of any one fra-
ternity’s members who filled
positions did so when a mem-
ber of their own fraternity was
Editor-in-Chief.

Thus there seems to be lit-
tle ground on which to base an
argument denying that Editors-
in-Chief pick underlings at least
partially because they are of

. by Millner

the freshman's opinion of Con-
verse ladies.

Why does the senior feel so
entirely different from the
underclassman? This may be
due to several points which
1 shall now enumerate:

1. Was the freshman given
the shaft by a “country girl?”
This often leads a student to
make such quick judgment, and
also it causes him to be pre-
judiced.

2. Does the freshman feel
that his blood is “bluer” than
the Converse tadies’? If he
would look more deeply into
the situation, he could plain-
ly see that the students come
from similar backgrounds.

As proof of this there are

many brother-and-sister _rela-
tionships at the respective
schools.

3. Did the freshman blind-
date to Converse; and after
the Converse lady saw him,
did she send out her maid in-
stead?

Maybe this sounds § far-
fetched, but as has been
pointed out, his remark is al-
so far-fetched.

4. Does it not seem possible
that the freshman hasn't yet at-
tained the poise of a senior and
therefore feels inferior around
ladies of high standing?

It is not at all unusual for a
person to project his faults up-
on another person when he
feels inferior.

There numerous other points,
but since the bell just rang for
the “cow-milkin" and “aigg-
gathering” classes, I must close.

we
their own fraternity, rather
than solely on the basis of
merit.
OBJECTIONS

At this point it seems proper
to introduce and discuss some
objections which might be
made to my argument.

First, there is the objection
that, since fraternities differ in
size, one cannot arbitrarily say
that one-twelfth of the key staff
members would be from each
fraternity by chance. This ob-
jection is valid, but only to a
point.

Investigation reveals that the
size of fraternities varied over
the eleven-year period, but that
differences in total membership
over a period of time tended to
be small.

FRATS VARY

Second, some will argue that
fraternities vary in regard to
the all-around capabilities of
their members; that some fra-
ternities tend to have more
leaders in all phases of campus
life.

This argument is also valid,

: but again only to a certain de-

gree. While it may partially ex-
plain the preponderance of of-
fices held by members of a few
fraternitiqs, it cannot do so
completely.

If it were true that the pre-
ponderance of leaders are to
be found in one or two fra-
ternities, we would find that
the same fraternities dominate
nearly all groups.

But we have seen from our

’

dsonian: Sta

examination of THE DAVID-
SONIAN that this is not the
case: the fraternities whose
members were so powerful on
the DAVIDSONIAN staff have
had few members on the
Scripts 'n Pranks staff.

(it may be here noted that
in the past six years, fifty-six
of the total ninety-three key
staff members of Scripts ‘n
Pranks have been from two fra-
ternities —- Sigma Chi or Phi
Gamma Delta. Five times dur-
ing the last six years, the editor
has been a member of Sigma
Chi. This could almost never
come about by pure chance.)

NATURAL ATTRACTION?

Third. it might be suggested
that those who are capable
writers are naturally attracted
to the fraternities which al-
ready have many writers.

While this may be true in
some cases, I do not feel that
(1) this has too widespread an
effect, or that (2) anywhere
near all of those who work on
the DAVIDSONIAN Staff are
at all sure during Rush Week
of their freshman year that
they will do so.

If the odds in support of my
position were only ten to one,
or even fifty to one, I would
admit ‘that there was consider-
able room for doubt.

Since, however, the odds are
around one thousand to one, I
feel justified in concluding that
fraternity allegiance plays a
significant role in the selection
of staff members for THE DA-
VIDSONIAN.

“TOIL AND TROUBLE

Henderson Strike:

ad

aes

What WillHappen’

By JOHN STONE

Labor strife has figured prominently in North Caro-
lina lately. Workers have been on strike at Henderson for

several months now.

Violence and charges and counter charges have been
rife. Attempts to mediate have gotten nowhere. And the

strike goes on.

The strike began when the management refused to
renew an arbitration clause in the contract. The clause
nad been in the contract for 14 years, and there was ap-
parently no reason given at the time for the refusal to

renew it.

Most of the sporadic violence connected with the
strike has consisted of rock throwing and the like, al-
though some of it has been more serious in nature.

The mills are back in partial operation now, due to
the empicyment of outside workers, but. the strike is ©

by no means broken.

All prolonged strikes are something of a tragedy.
Workers are out of jobs, and their families suffer. On
the other hand, the owners are certainly losing money.
In this case, the taxpayers are losing somethirg too, as
the National Guard was called out Tuesday in an attempt

to prevent further violence.

The important thing about the Henderson strike,
however, is that it may possibly set some sort of prece-
dent, especially if it continues.

As the industrial economy of the South grows, it is
almost inevitable that labor unions will try to keep pace,
and many of our laws and regulations favor them. If the
Henderson strike does grow into a big issue, the attempts
of labor to organize further will be affected.

And the strike could conceivably come to represent
even more than this. The union has been at Henderson
for years, and until now there have been few outward
manifestations of disharmony.

The attitude of management toward labor is harden-
ing, which means, if management wins at Henderson,
unions atready in existence may be in for some difficul-
ties. If labor wins, it may be in a somewhat better bar-
gaining position than previously.

The final results remain to be seen.
