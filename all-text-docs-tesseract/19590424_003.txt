The Intra-mural Athletic Council elects new

ficers next week and this year’s president, Ralph Sloan
Wilson steps down. Probably there are a good many peo-
ple on this campus who couldn’t tell you what the initials
IMAC stand for. But that's the way it has been all year
with IMAC, and Wilson, and the other eleven fraternity
representatives. They’ve done as fine a job as could pos-
sible be expected of a first year governing council and /in the process.

The germ of the IMAC idea began to take form al-
most two years ago when DAVIDSONIAN Sports Editor. hits. They added one in the

Probably the largest contribution of the IMAC to 4

intramural sports at Davidson has yet to be unveiled. It

Davidson played host to the Pfeiffer College nine this afternoon with Dee Lide
slated for mound duty. A double-header with V.M.I. scheduled for yesterday was

called because of a wet field.

The  luckless ‘Cats were

weekend. The Wiidcats dropped

In the first game Citadel

appreciate the patience, understanding, and hard work

Davidson’s hard-luck baseball Wildcats may be on
the short end of an 11-2 record, but three very influen-
tial gentlemen seem to think that at least one ’Cat is
worth taking a look at. Major League scouts Bill Harris
(Washington), Clyde Klutz (Kansas City), and Rube Wil-
son (Chicago Cubs) had their eyes on smooth shortstop
Don (Weasel) Killian during last week’s Presbyterian

game.

BAREFOOT BOYS WITH SPIKES

Jackpot

Three and a half years ago two young men from

the Tennessee hills put on

their shoes, descended the

slopes of Lookout Mountain and headed toward David-
son. From this inauspicious beginning emerged two of

{Davidson’s most promising
Mel Armstrong.

Best of friends in high
school, the two Tennesseans
decided to try their luck at
Davidson together. And, aft-
er their sophomore year,
when the joys of the scholas-
tic life seemed rather doubt-
ful, they both dropped out of.
school for a year and went
off to Fort Jackson to serve
Uncle Sam.

After their brief hitch in the
service was up, they returned
to Davidson together last fall

to continue their studies.

It's a lucky thing for Wild-
cat. fortunes that Armstrong
and Johnson stuck together and
came back to Davidson. Both
have been outstanding in their
respective sports this year.

Tom made his sporting debut
last fall when he reported for
soccer practice. A leader in the

year, he again assumed a po-
sition of responsibility.

He was runner-up in the
season scoring total to
Weicher Bergsma with seven
goals. Also, from his position
on the forward line, he at-
tributed a considerable num-
ber of assists.

The merit. of his play was
recognized by his teammates as
he was chosen to serve as co-
captain for next year, along
with Ward’ McKeithen.

In the spring, young Tom’s
fancy turned to golf. Early in
the season he held down the
number two slot, but now, on
the basis of shooting low team
total in Monday’s match with
Furman and Wake Forest, ap
pears a Strong challenger to
Verner Stanley’s number one
position.

When track started, it was
Armatrong’s turn to shine.
Mel had been undefeated in
dual meets in the 100 and
220 his sophomore year, but
hed troubles achieving top
form at the first of the sea-
son. The year’s tay-off ac-
counted for an early season
less.

In the Wake Forest meet two
weeks ago, he finally hit his
stride crossing the finish line,
(aided by the wind) in fhe 100,
yard dash in 9.9 seconds. Since
the Citadel meet the first of
the season, he is undefeated.

Armstrong also starred in
flickerball and received the
highest number of points in the’
balloting for the all-star team.

Both Armstrong and Johnson
will graduate next year; Arm-!
strong at the end of the first
semester, Johnson in the
spring. |

Davidson downed Richmond sprints. His. time in the 100 was5' 9” mark. Huie pushed him-

69'S-61% last season and Coach
Whittle felt that our chances
were good for a win today.

in the 880 and Bush earned nine
points to lead the Indians in-

Whittle plans to take his en-

events are scheduled. The 'Cats
will run a 440, and 880, a mile,

About ten collegs will par-
