Win-Starved Apps Topple Cats

Favored Paladins Fall, 58- 52

By STEVE SOUD ’84

“Let me have men about me that are fat;
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o’
nights:
Yond Cassius hath a lean and hungry
look;
He thinks too much: such men are dan-
gerous.”

—Caesar

from Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar”

After Tuesday night’s 60-58 over-
time embarassment at the hands of win-
starved Appalachian State, Bobby Hus-
sey knows that such teams are danger-
ous.

The Wildcats, coming off two fat
wins over Notre Dame and Furman,
were, as Bobby Hussey put it, “flat as a
worn out pancake.” The Mountaineers,
coming off a double overtime loss to 2-
10 Milligan College (who?) of the
NAIA, were lean and hungry for the

win. Combine those factors with the:

fact that Davidson was looking past the
Apps to tomorrow night’s game at UT-
Chattanooga, and you come up with
trouble.

“We just weren’t prepared, that’s all
there was too it,”
Rowan admitted later.

“We sleepwalked for about 40 min-
utes, woke up briefly in the five minute
overtime, and then went back to sleep
again,” Hussey said of what he called “a
very miserable night” for him and his
team. “We had tons and tons of oppor-
tunities to win the game. We just didn’t
take advantage of any of them.”

Cantwell, on the other hand, was
elated with his very young (no seniors,
eight freshmen) team’s play. “We’ve
got an identity now,” he said. “It’s am-
azing what 48 hours can do. I’ve over-
coached these guys. Tonight I just said
take it to the hoop.”

The Apps, thanks often to their own
hard play and more often to Davidson’s
lax defensive play, did that plenty as
time after time they came up with un-
contested layups and second shots.
They outrebounded the lackluster Wild-
cats a resounding 35-22. In short, they
just plain outplayed the Wildcats.

In the first half, Davidson led only
once by as many as four points, as the
Mountaineers bullied and battled for ev-
' ery break they could get. Just past mid-
way of the half when Hussey was sure
that his starters weren’t playing well, he
substituted in some shock troops —
Gerry Born and Rafael Hernandez for
Cliff Tribus, and Frank Johnson for Ro-
wan. Even so, the Wildcats could only
scrape together a scant 26-24 halftime
lead.

The brief hiatus to the bench did the
Starters little good. It appeared to have
fanned their fires a bit when, by the
17:16 mark, Davidson had built a 34-28
lead. The six point margin didn’t last
long, and the Wildcats were mired in a
basket-for-basket battle before they
knew it.

With 3:53 left and the score tied 45-
45, Kenny Wilson hit the first of two
free throws, but missed the second only
to have the ball go off ASU hands. Da-
vidson chose patience as its best course
and as Applachian showed a stifling tri-
angle-and-two defense. The defense ef-

fectively neutralized the inside threats
of Tribus and Kenny Wilson as it kept
the ball on the perimeter. Finally Rod
Davis fouled Rowan with 1:27 left, and
the senior hit both ends of the one-and-
one to give the Cats a 48-45 lead.

What appeared to be safe lead
turned about completely on two defen-
sive breakdowns on the other end. The
first came as David Lawrence slipped
by and then was fouled by Richard Wil-
son while shooting. He missed the free
throw, but DAvis found himself all
alone in the lane for the rebound and the
easy layin as Tribus fouled him. Davis
missed his free throw with 1:07 left to
hold the ASU lead a 49-48.

On Davidson’s next possession Tri-
bus missed an open 18-footer from the
right baseline, and the rebound glanced
off Richard Wilson out of bounds.

Andy Black would up with a fast
break off a long pass, but John Carroll
fouled him to save the easy basket. It
didn’t work out, as he hit both free
throws to put ASU on top 51-48 with :40
left.

John Carroll took the ball down-
court with one object in mind, and he hit
it — a three pointer with :21 left to tie
the game. The defense then placed a
moratorium on disaster when it held up
a last second Applachian shot.

Free throws were the story of over-
time as ASU built a 60-55 lead on them
with :43 left. Carroll took a slice out of
that with his second three pointer to
close the gap to 60-58 with :35 remain-
ing.

Appalachian got another fast break
on an inbounds, but Carroll darted out
of nowhere to pick off the would-be
game-winning assist, but on neither of
two tries could the Wildcats capitalize
on a three pointer. Had they ben able to,
it wouldn’t have been fair to the young
Mountaineers, who had played so well.

At the same time, however, it didn’t
help Davidson, which dropped to 7-6
overall and 3-1 in the S.C. as they go in-
to Chattanooga tomorrow night and host
powerful ETSU Monday night in John-
ston Gym. As Rowan pointed out, “Ev-
ery time we take two steps forward, we
take one step backward.”

The Wildcats can take a big step for-
ward with one or two wins these next
few days.
