COUNSELORS, from page 5

Puckett: I gave 15 packets to
an SAE anda friend who were
going as the Condom Twins. I
gave it to him, another guy on
the hall and some guys off the
hall.

Williams: I did give one out
but it was for a water balloon.
The Davidsonian: How have
your outside interests: frater-
nities, sports, artistic endeav-
ors, etc. been affected by your
duties as a hall counselor?
Puckett: Iam just as active as I
ever was. am president of the
waterskiing club, taught two
waterskiing classes, managed
the women’s volleyball team,
and now | am wresting.
Williams: Yeah, my extracur-
ricular things haven’t suffered
too much.

I might say it is’ the other
way around—my time spent
with baseball, I have to do
that, hasdecreased my time on
the hall but it hasn’t been.too
bad.

The Davidsonian: Have you
continued to have the same re-
lationships with your class,
old friends, and others or have
you stayed mostly with your
hallmates?

Puckett: They all went away.
The people I have been closest
to this year are the freshmen.
I’ve kept in touch with who I
can, but mostof my friends are
gone, they’re not here.

Williams: guess I fall into that
“other” category, I have a girl-
friend but being a hall coun-
selor hasn’t threatened my re-
lationship with her.

The Davidsonian: If you can,
give some strange, weird, or
funny experience with your
hall.

Puckett: The raft...for the
Freshman Regatta everyone
else had kegs with wood on
them or inflatable rafts.

We had just a big two by four
and tied four ropes to it...we
were winning most of time,
four guys swimming across.
There a lot of zany things.
Williams: Well as far as delin-
quency goes, the guys on my
hall thoughtit was really funny
to drop trashcans of water on
people as they entered. But we
gota little bit of a visit from the
campus police asking us not to
do that.

Then we have Late Night

with Ed Rizzo, (a guy our hall),
and about 15 guys tell zany sto-
ries and jokes at 1:30 a.m.
The Davidsonian: Has your
role towards your freshmen
been as a disciplinarian, older
brother, or a fellow student?
Have there been any serious in-
fractions, possibly illegal, by
your hallmates?

If so, did you handle the
problems yourself or did you
seek some outside agency?
Puckett: I think I’ve been a bit
of them all as disciplinarian,
older brother...I’ve told people

to turn down radios hun-
dreds of times; eventually
they usually get the point.
Williams: I’d say I’ve been
more of the brother side. I eat
in the Commons with them
and that helps.

They got comfortable with
me with the fact they could

Pick on me about my love
life... They come to me with
their problems—

Puckett: Sometimes people
just get unruly. Maybe some-
one will get mad because he
has broken up with his girl-
friend. That happened just
the other day.

The Davidsonian: At the mid-
point of the year, has being a
hall counselor been worth it?
If so, how and in what ways?
If not, why not?

Puckett: It sounds kind of
dumb, butit does putyouina
position where you're
known. I have no regrets.

The only thing is my grades
aren’tas good, I mean they’re
good, but not as good as the
past.

I’ve learned a lot about
myself, people have helped a
lot. It makes you look outside
yourself and see how others
see you.

Williams: Pretty much what!
expected. I mean you expectit

sometimes to be time-con-:

suming and unpleasant. In

the long run it’s almost a fa-.

ther trial... These guys are just
out of high school, some want

to be independent, but others
are homesick.

The Davidsonian: From your
experience, what advice
would you give to someone
who is hoping to be a hall
counselor next year?
Puckett: Expect anything. If
you get hall counselor, you
have to expect on putting ina
lot of work.

You may think you can just
float by, but you have to be on
the hall, and become one with
them.

I myself am reliving my

freshman experience. I had
good hall counselors but the
hall, well, it was just one of
those things where nobody
got along.
Williams: When you're re-
warded by being a hall coun-
selor there isa degree of pride
in it and there isa tendency to
abuse your privileges.

Be yourself. Don’t expect to

have all the answers, a lot of
times the freshmen will figure
out a solution.
Puckett: A lot of times you
have be like one of those plas-
ticdummies that bounceright
back up.

They’re just going to throw
things at you and you as con-
cerned listener are going to
say things like “yeah, that’s
right.” 8

They know pretty much
what they want todo, and just
need to articulate to someone
that agrees with them.
