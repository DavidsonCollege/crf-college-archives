DAVIDSON BOXER
IN GOLDEN GLOVES

Davidson’s one bid for fame in
last week's GoldeneGlove tourna-
ments was freshman Hal Haynes
from Bristol, Tenn. Clad in light
green trunks, the scrappy middle-
weight showed lots of fight: in his
one bout.

Although he drew a good man in
his initial bout, Hal lost:by a very
close decision, and if he could have
gotten on the offensive quicker, he
might have come out on top His

‘hard punches and blocking showed

the fans that Davidson has promise
of outstanding boxing material,

The Bristol, Tenn., boy is a re-
cently initiated Kappa Alpha
brother. He stands 5 feet 11 inches,
weighing in at around 160 pounds.
He plans to put in another bid next
year and may be joined by other
Davidson mates.

Cats Lose To UN.C.
Beat Wofford, 60-45

It too much Carolina for

the Cats in the Charlotte Armory
as Davidson bowed to the White
Phantoms, 52-46. A fourth period
drive which narrowed.an eighteen-
point margin to the final six was
not quite enough.
THe teams left the court at inter-
mission with the Phants boasting
a 27-22 lead. The Tar Heels roared
with a fast breaking offense in the
third period to push the count to
48-30 with 10 minutes remaining.
Then it was the Cats’ turn to get
hot, but it was too late

Jake Ashmore and Whit Cobb
took. over the yeoman’s scoring
3uddy Cheek and Mike
Williams both fell off on the score
board. Ashmore flipped in five
field goals and two free throws fou
12 points. Cobb also swished the
cords on five fielders, but only got
one charity toss to bring his total
to 11, Four of Cobb’s fielders came
in the last period drive which al-
most paid off.

Although off with his bucket eye,
Cheek played a fine floor game.
He stole the ball from the Heels
no than seven times in the
last three minutes of play to set
up the plays for Wildcat markers,

The loss postponed the Cats’ as-
surance of a tournament bid, but
a victory over either Furman or
The Citadel would put the Presby-
terians in.

The Cats went out of the con-
ference Saturday night and
journeyed to Spartanburg to down
a scrappy Wofford five.
The Presbyterians gained a 60-45
margin, but it wasn't until the
last -quarer that they garnered
the final margin. The ‘Terriers
stuck with Davidson all the way
and left the court at halftime on
the short end of a 28-22 score.

Mike Williams paced the Cats by
pouring in 17 points. Buddy Cheek
hit for 15 while Jake Ashmore rang
in 10, Bobby Maner and Whit Cobb
played their usual sterling floor
games while hitting for seven and
six points respectively.
