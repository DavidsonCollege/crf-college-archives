At the other end of the dine, Hal Mapes played one of the

best defensive games of the qay. On several occasions he

cleared out three Furman blockers and even mad@ the tackle
several times, Coach Charley -hunerson singled Mapes out as
having played his best wame of the year,

Carl Eborn stood out at tackle as usual. The hefty Virginian
plaved in the Hurricane backfield as much as any of the Pal-
metto lads. Eborn wastast week given honorable mention
by United Press seribes who named the Southern Conference
All-Star squad. Cheek received similiar recoenition for his end
play.

The Wildeat guard play was up to its usual par. Buddy
Chandler that

showed fight and spirit has seldom been

up on defense. Bob Sharpe played lis usually heads-up ball
gume, recovering a furman fumble and being in on nearly
every play. Fred Preyer came through again as a first-line
reserve that gave the Greenville boys no rest.

All three of the Cat centers, Johnny Richards, Henry Wil
son and Bronco Bailey, looked like first stringers. Walson,
playing mostly on defense, filled in the hole on nearly every
play besides batting down several passes.

The running of Jim Sifford was great. He carried the mail
five times, netted 34 vards for a nifty 6S vard average. Sif
ford shifted, spun, steppted, sped like an All-American. His ,
defensive play also. stood out. Jake Wade played his best game
of the year in piling up a 6.1 averave in eight tries,

The saddest part of the Ball game was disfigurement of
the bridgework of one of-the?vampus’s most notable men of
distinetion, Student Body President Carl Pahl, playing. his
last collegiate football game, had the misfortune of running
into a holejand coming out minus his two front teeth, Pahl
played a fine game for his swan sone as did plunging Mae

Erwin who hung up his uniform for the last game, too.

The victory brought a rather dismal grid season to a happy
climax by giving Davidson a record of three wins against five
losses and a tie.

His illustrious football career began’

It was on a windy 4-mile, water-

soaked course that the Davidson
cross country team turned in what
Coach ‘Pete’ Whittle termed the
best performance of the season in
defeating North Carolina State's
Harriers, 26-29, last week-end in
Raleigh.

The course, commonly regarded
as one of the roughest in the South-
ern Conference, was rendered even
more difficult by a strong head wind
and a soggy turf under foot.

The victory was of especial sig-
nificance in that only a week -be-
