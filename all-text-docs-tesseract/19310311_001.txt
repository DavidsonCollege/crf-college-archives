of Georgia Will Speak Here

Prominent Leader of Southern
Sports to Deliver Princ'pal
Address on Athletic Night

AWARDS WILL BE MADE

One of the Important and Interest-
ing Events of the Year

Dean S. V. Sanford, of the University
of Georgia, will be the speaker of the eve-
ning next Tuesday night, March 17, at Ath-
letic Night, announced Captain Norton G.
Pritchett, Davidson professor of physical
education, Monday. This completes the
preparation for this annual event of increas-
ing interest and significance. Each year some
prominent leader in Southern sports is in-
vited to deliver the address, and, as stu-
dents will recall, this address was made last
year by Mr. N. W. Daugherty, of the Uni-

_ versity of Tennessee, then president of the
Southern Conference, who talked on ath-
letics in general and evidences of commer-
cialization of collegiate sports, notably foot-

ball.

Dean Sanford was one of the founders
of the present organization of the Southern
Conference, and for ten years was the chief
executive of that body. He nationally
known in athletic circles, and at present is
a member of the Executive Committee of
the National Collegiate Athletic Association,
and for over 25 years he has been closely
aligned with the best interests of athletics
at the University of Georgia and through-
out the South in general.

1S

Athletic Night at Davidson is a compara-
tively new feature of the college calendar,
but is fast becoming an outstanding affair.
At this time, in addition to the address by
Dean Sanford, athletic performances of merit
in all fields will be rewarded. Certificates
and letters will be awarded to those who
have won them, and many other citations, in
the form of cups and trophies, will be given
to men outstanding in gymnastic ability, and
physical dev. elopment. At this time also, stars,
gold footballs, and similar distinctions will
be presented, and reports will be made by
the Davidson Athletic Association.

Dr. Johnson Will Speak
At “Y” Services Sunday

Annual Spring Services to Follow
on Sunday, March 22

Davidson College will have the opportunity
of hearing Dr. Albert Sidney Johnson, pas-
tor of the First Presbyterian Church of
Charlotte, at the “Y” vesper service on Sun-
day evening, March 15.

Dr. Johnson is a graduate of Auburn and
the’Union Theological Seminary in Rich-
mond, Va. For several years he preached
at the South Highland Presbyterian Church,
Birmingham, Ala., and from there came to
his present pastorate in Charlotte, where he
has been for the past twelve years. Dr. John-
son has a great interest in young people and

will bring a message of value to his audi-
ence.

On the following Sunday, March 22, Dr.
Charles F. Myers, pastor of the First Pres-
byterian Church of Greensboro, N. C., will
speak at vespers. Dr. Myers will conduct
the spring evangelistic services here this
year from Sunday, March 22, through
Wednesday, March 25. His coming to thé
Davidson campus is always looked forward
to with a great deal of enthusiasm and in-
terest.

Both of these men are well known at Da-
vidson, each having spoken here several times
in the past, and each having several students
in college who are members of their con-
gregations. Both Dr. Johnson and Dr. Myers
have sons in school at the present time, Wil-
liam T. Johnson and Charles F. Myers, Jr.
Each of these ministers took part in the re-
. cent Congress on World Missions held in
Chattanooga,' Tenn.

ice, which will be held March 29, will be a
song service conducted by the students.

Fraternity Averages

Figures from the registrar's office show
| that the Kappa Alnha fraternity ranked first
| place in the inter-fraternity scholastic stand-
ing for the first semester of this, the 1930-31
session. Their average for the term was
86.59, which was 1.44 points ahead of the
Sigma Phi Epsilon’s, who stood second with
jan average of 85.15. It is interesting to note
that the entire variation of all ten social
fraternities lacked .01 of a point of being
| exactly five points, as the highest average
(which is mentioned above) was 86.59 and
the lowest was 81.60. The following list

son varsity men, Fleagle, George, and Kuy-
kendall, scored seight points to tie P. C.
for first place, by placing first, third, and
fourth, respectively, in the 60-yard dash. Al-
though Haliburton, a member of the Fresh-
man squad, got off to a-bad start and had
some very good competition, he placed fourth
in the 60-yard dash. The teams entered in
this non-conference competition were David-
son, Presbyterian College of South Carolina,
Guilford, and Elon.

To the first three men finishing the 60-
yard dash, medals were given. These medals

were given to Fleagle, who won the race
with the time of 6.6, thus tying the time
of the winner in the conference meet; to
Green of P. C., who finished second, al-
