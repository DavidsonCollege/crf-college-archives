BY CARL KLEIN

A certain place wes papulnius

Until they drapped the bomb.

His citizenry truly was

A fearless {rae conglom!

Which at cach rising sun would ray:
“Sarelv if won'l be today."

One tremulous individual, wha
Destruction in the fature spied,
A method which was certain to
Protect his being he applied - -
To save himself from Death’s grim hug
A shelter underground he dug.

A few took up the ery he raieed.

A sense of duty true and strong

Was with thom; therefore nothing fazed
“So that we ourselves might save

More Fallout Shelters we muat have!"

And sn this brave trustworthy (ew;
Their duty set before their eyes,
Tabored till their dream came trac.
(Loyal men thev were, and wisa.

Bach one a Boy Scout could have bean,
Had he been reverent and clean.)

Above each basemant antranceway
Appeared a black and yellow sign,
(Also above each cavity - -

Bo {t sewer, cave, or mine.)

Hach one claiming, doen't you see,
A Fallout Shelter there to he.

Before too many days had passed
The air was hewn by fearfal cry:
“Get thee to a Shelter, fast!"

People boxtened to comply,

But each one wag doomed to Find
Tie could not quite monks up his mind!

They perishatl in the atreets that day

Aud tf you'd not witl up thot way
Be guided by thik maxi sound;

if you woul

You'd darn well better know which one,
