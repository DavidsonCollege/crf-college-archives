member this pageant as the one which

the Greensboro girls gave there. The

| performance was so successful that Dav-

enport College and Mitchell College
have copied it, and it has been repro-
duced in churches in at least six or eight

ed in each class to choose the member- |
ship of this smaller group. Owing to
the nature of his talks, Dr. Wright per-
sistently refused to address the whole
student body.

During the war Dr. Wright was the
chairman of Christian activities at Camp
Devens, Mass., where he had under his
supervision two hundred thousand men.
He is now the professor of Christian
Methods at Yale Seminary. His wide
experience in aiding scores of men in
their struggle to -know Christ makes
him especially valuable as an instructor
in the problem of dealing with men.

The subject of the first lecture was
“What Are We Trying to Do?” Per-
sonal evangelism was the central theme.
“Personal evangelism,” said Dr. Wright,
“is the art of helping men toward the
attainment of a complete life. Personal
evangelism is the attempt to accomplish
this through the processes of friendship.
The object of personal evangelism is to
persuade men through the ministry of
friendship to decide deliberately and
whole-heartedly to take the way which
leads to fullness of life. The contagion
of one’s personality, working through
the process of friendship, is the most
effective and only means through which
some can be won.” Evangelism, he said,
is concerned with the individual sought
and the Christian worker, conversion
with God and the will of the individual
to be saved.

Dr. Wright, in’ his second, third, and
fourth lectures, on Friday morning and
night, answered several questions of
great interest to any one wanting to be
a real friend.

Shall my dominant purpose in college
be to get friends or to be a friend? was
the question put by Dr. Wright. These
twovare as different as hell and heaven,
wrong and right. It is easy enough to
get friends by just hanging out a “hard
luck” sign, and being pleasant, but to be
a friend is a@lifferent and better matter.

If one would be pure, how shall he
detect the approach of an impure
thought? There are four stages in im-
pure thinking: the temptation, the sec-
ond look, the fascination, the fall. Any
man may have the temptation, but
should be sure to stop right there, if he
would keep pure.

speak on “His Bugle Calls,” A. C, Sum-

ers. Six will speak on Friday at 8 p. m,
and six on Saturday at 10:30 a. m.

Saturday at 2:30 p. m. the Davidson

Elon Loses to Hurricane
Wildcats By 47-0 Score

Red and Black Has Easiest Victory
of Season Here on Friday
Afternoon.

End runs to the right of them, tackle
bucks to the left of them, passes over the
top of them, fumbles behind them anda
stone wall-in front of them, briefly de-
scribes the plight of Elon’s football team
last Friday. When the referee finally
ended the rout the Wildcats weré on the
long end of a 47-0 count. Elon had prac-
tically no chance to score and played a
defensive game throughout.

The Christians threatened only once,
late in the final’ quarter, when they man-
aged to work the pigskin to Davidson’s
vight-yard line, on two long passes, The
Red and Black defense stiffened, how-
ever, and Davis blocked Smith's drop
kick. Schenck snatched up the ball and
carried it 70 yards up the field out of
danger.

Before the first quarter was over the
second team was sent into the fray, and
before the game was over many third
string Wildkittens saw action, After the
track meet of the first period had piled
up a commanding lead, the Presbyterians
practiced field goals during the last
period. The one regret of the day for
the team and spectators was that their
fighting captain, Doc LaFar, switched
from guard to the backfield, failed to
make his touchdown.

As every backfield man called upon
proved to be a consistent ground gainer,
it iS impossible to pick any individual
stars. However, the all-round work of
Shepherd, who gained 104 yards from
scrimmage, and of Schenck, who had a
grand total of 205 yards to his credit,
deserve special mention, The line, led
by LaFar, Davis and Brice, played its
usual.good game, Elon’s line plays being
smothered almost before they started.

Clark at left end broke up many plays
and played the best all-round game for
the visitors. Perry was the backbone of
the backfield and made practically all
their gains. Line-up;
