TO OUR ALUMNI.

THE Davipsonian rejoices at the in-
dications of a large reunion of David-
son alumni here at Commencement, and
extends to each of them a most hearty
welcome.

THE SOPHOMORE BANQUET.

Any student who has been here three
or four years can tell of a time when the
Banquet was the greatest event of the
Sophomore year. Money was carefully
hoarded, “Skit’s” was avoided, suits were
pressed and laid away two weeks before-
hand, and the barber shops had record
crowds the dav before. At the long
looked for hour seventy odd hilarious,
stylish young gentlemen’ waved a fare-
well as the “dummy, dummy line” bore
them to Charlotte. They returned at
unearthly hours that night, waking
evervone by wandering over the campus
as tho they had lost something. And
then thev were seen no more till the din-
ner the next day. At that time they told
of eating and drinking, music, eloquence.
and merry-making. And alumni tell to-
day of that great experience in their coal-
lege career.

But with the class of 1917 there came
a change war and a flattening of pocket
hooks. Nevertheless a banquet in Char-
lotte was planned till fathers objected.
so it was held at Davidson. The onlv
thing lackine was stvle, for the food was
good. and there was enjoyment, spirit.
and flowery sneeches to spare. The
1918 clacs likewise planned for a ban-
auet in Charlotte. but despite the coun-
trv’s nrosnerity, too few could afford it.
While trvine to decide whether or no to
have it in Davidson, examinations have
crept up and this vear will see no Ban-
quet.

What could be the cause of this? Not
lack of spirit certainly, for what clase

has shown more “pep” in every phase of
college life than the present Sophomore
class. The trouble probably lies in plan-
ning a too expensive banquet in Char-

lotte instead of one in Davidson to which].

everyone could go. This would not be
dishonorable, for it is only a few years
since the practice of holding these func-
tions in Charlotte began. It may be
that following classes will profit by the
experience of these two, and enjoy a
spirited Sophomore Banquet in David-
son.

MEANING OF ELECTIONS.

The past two weeks have been ones
of elections. Every office from the Pres-
idency of the student body to the jani-
torship of the Literary Society Halls
have been filled. Some sixty youthful
faces have flushed with pride as the names
of their owners came first in the ballot.
But in many cases there is a wrong atti-
tude taken by these fortunate, or is it
unfortunate, ones. “Too often when a
man is elected he feels that his work is
done, he has gained the confidence of his
fellows, and proved himself worthy of
his office. The position is his to keep.
and there is laid up for him a year of
honor on account of it. If everyone
would feel that election to office means

‘primarily, the beginning, not the end, of

work, and secondly, honor, how much
more eficiently each position would be
filled and how much fewer the number
of failures.

Editor Davinpsontan: During the
more than ten years since the writer be-
came an alumnus of Davidson College,
no one has followed her career with more
genuine interest. “This interest is in her

‘lathletic, social, moral, religious, and in-

tellectual life—in her student body and
faculty. In short, Davidson is my Alma
Mater. Her defects hurt; her successes
gladden; her faults humble; her critics
sting.

Recently a big-hearted benefactor of
Davidson visited that place. He and.
wife are strong friends of Davidson.
Yet. it is true that they did not feel free
and easy upon Davidson’s campus. Mr.
Editor, is it true that Davidson's best
friends—gentlemen and ladies, cultured
and refined—are subjected to yells, ete.
attracting undue attention to them.
These two friends of the college refrain
ed from looking over the plant as they
desired because they did not care to be
the objects of such, the writer hopes,
thoughtless rudeness. People judge
Davidson by Davidson, what she has
done and is. Tf Davidson desires friends,
if Davidson keeps friends. she must al-
ways show herself friendly and court-
cous.

Until Davidson takes this “forward
step.” the last trace of “prep-schoolism”
—-this may be a reftection on prep-schools
—has not been abolished. Men. hear
the plea of an alumnus and son of Dav-
idson. Raise Davidson above reproach.
Honor her guests as vou do guests in
your own home. Her guests are your
guests, AN ALUMNUS.

REV. MR. HOUGH FILLS
LOCAL PULPIT

Rev. R.-E. Hough, pastor of Knox
Presbyterian church, Charlotte, N. C.,
filled the local Presbyterian church Sun-
day. Taking for his text Hebrews
11:23-26, he gave a very instructive ser-
mon, in which he drew an analogy from
the life of Moses, and showed that it
paid to live for God and eternity at any
cost.

Miss Carrie Hood leaves this week
for her home in Chester, S. C. Miss
Hood has been teaching in the Graded
School here for the past three years.
