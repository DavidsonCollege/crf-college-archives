Good Times and
Slow Food

On Monday, Rachel and I attended our
first “Eat-In,” which was sponsored by Slow
Food, USA. An Eat-In, which is essentially
a potluck, promises the perfect opportunity
for people to meet, enjoy a meal and rally
together for a specific cause. This Eat-In
aimed to promote the reauthorization of
the Child Nutrition Act, a federal law that
expires this month. The event took place at
Common Market South, a funky food store
and restaurant that serves sandwiches and
salads. While the hosts provided barbecue
made from locally raised beef (yum!),
participants were encouraged to bring a dish
or make a donation.

According to Slow Food’s website,
“Slow Food is an idea, a way of living and
a way of eating. It is a global, grassroots
movement with thousands of members
around the world that links the pleasure of
food with a commitment to community and
the environment.” The organization focuses
on sustainable eating in order to protect the
planet and the farmer. Food that is healthy,
environmentally sound and economically
viable is their main concern. Everybody, they
advocate, should have access to “real food”.

On Labor Day, Slow Food sponsored
“Time for Lunch,” a national day of action
dedicated to keeping “real food” in public
schools. The Eat-In we attended last Monday
was one of many countrywide potlucks.
Slow Food defines “real food” as food that
is “good at every link in the chain. It tastes
good, it’s good for us, it’s good for the people
who grow it, it’s good for our country and it’s
good for the planet.” At “Time for Lunch”
events across the country, participants were
encouraged to sign a petition that urges
legislators to reauthorize the Child Nutrition
Act, a federal law that dictates school lunch
standards. More than 30 million children in
the US gobble down cafeteria cooking every
day, and recent budget cuts have forced
many schools to cut back on healthy food.
Slimmer school lunch allowance can have
frightening consequences. For example,
in 1999 the USDA shut down the Supreme
Beef plant after they found salmonella and
E. coli in a meat sample. Just six weeks later
Supreme Beef recommenced the sale of beef
to schools. A tight budget forces schools to
choose the cheapest chow despite health
hazards. This has a tremendous impact on
needy children, who depend on government-
run school lunch programs for their food.

about Slow Food and The Child Nutrition
Act, please visit www.slowfoodusa.org. The
deadline for reauthorization of the Child
Nutrition Act is September 2009. Act now!

Thursday. Although the musicians themselves
will not be appearing on campus, the bumping
beats and smooth melodies that their music is
so famous for will be remixed and reproduced
by Ben Ireland ’12. For Thursday’s concert,
Ireland has taken bits and pieces of popular
songs from different genres and fused them
together to create “spitting hot remixes”.
Here’s the catch: unlike other famous music
mashers, Ireland’s creative concoctions are
performed on the piano.

make an appearance, but that does not mean
that music lacks spunk. Ireland has the
uncanny ability to channel the bumping bass
of a drum and the electrifying roar of a guitar
simply by using the 88 keys on a piano. “T’ll
be playing part of one song on my left hand
and playing part of another song on my right
hand at the same time,” said Ireland. “People
listening to it will experience something
they never have before. I’m excited for the

Ireland started playing the piano when he
was 4 years old. He began studying theory
and performing classical music, but as he
grew older his interests changed. He started
creating and composing his own music and
even put out his own CD, titled “Angels”.
After the success of his CD, Ireland decided
that he wanted to expand his music in another
direction. So, he turned to “mashing”. David

Grilled Panini

Are you sick of peanut butter and
jelly? To make a more delicious and
sophisticated lunch, take a hint from
the Italians and grill your sandwiches to
make a panini. By grilling, you allow
the cheese to melt and the ingredients’
flavors to combine. Don’t have a
sandwich press? No problem! Just
slightly pre-toast your bread, layer your
ingredients, place the sandwich on a hot
skillet and use something heavy (like a
pot lid, or even a spatula) to push down
onto the panini until it’s thoroughly
heated.

Did you know: In Italian,
“panini” is a plural noun, and
one sandwich would actually be
“il panino?” However, since
the word has become part of the
English language, it’s perfectly
acceptable to refer to your single
grilled sandwich as a panini.

It is easy to get creative with your
panini combinations, but here are a few
of my favorites:

The Classic Caprese

Layer slices of fresh mozzarella
cheese, tomatoes and whole basil leaves
on crusty Italian bread. Add plenty of
extra virgin olive oil and salt. Grill until
the mozzarella has completely melted.

The Californian

Stack thinly sliced turkey, avocado,
bacon and extra-sharp white cheddar
cheese on ciabatta bread. Be sure to put
cheese slices on both pieces of bread so
that the panini holds together well.

Mediterranean Grilled Chicken

Layer slices of grilled chicken,
several sundried tomatoes, and
provolone cheese on whole wheat bread
that’s spread generously with basil
pesto.
