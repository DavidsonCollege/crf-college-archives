By HARRIETT HODGES

The student Senate heard a
report trom College President
Samuel Ko Spencer Jr on the
future of subsidized athletics at
Davidson ino its) meeting this
week

At present. the athlete
program Is Movine mm no
detinite direction, according to
Spencer However, he did in
dicate that the trend in the toot
ball program was towards cut
ting its cost and offermy tewer
grants to players

Because Davidson is not able
to offer as many grants as the
other schools in the Southern
Conterence. the Davidson foot-
ball program is tinding it dil-
ficult to produce teams to com-
pete on the same level with
schools like Richmond and East
Carolina. according to Spencer

“The cost of an athletic
program to us is much greater
than to state schools in the con-
ference.” Spencer said

By MARK DEATON
Asst. Managing Editor

Freshman hall counselors tor
1973-74 will be announced
during the first week of March.
according to Dean of Students
Will Terry.

A committee composed ot
Freshman Advisors Jerry God-
behere and Dave Bender, hall
counselors Tom Jenkins and
Mark Monson, Faculty Ad-
visors Ben Kline and Herb
Jackson, Director of Student
Counseling William B. Hight.
Director of Student Housing
Scotty Nicholls, and Terry will
select approximately 24 men
and eight women from 76 ap-
plications made by rising
juniors.

**My feeling is that hall coun-
selors perform the best service
to Davidson College and to their
fellow students of all per-
forming service jobs on cam-
pus,” said Terry.

**Hall counselors are more in-
volved with people on the most
personal level. In the past. most
have been the type of men
responding to this creatively
and conscientiously. as they
catch students in a_ pretty
traumatic time.” Terry said.

All applicants are required to
fill out an application, take
some psychological testing, and
appear before the _ selection
committee for a 10 minute in-
terview. The selection com-
mittee also asks for recom-
mendations from present hall
counselors.

During the ten minute in-
terviews each student has with
the nine member committee,
Terry indicated, they get more
of a tone from the student than
answers to specifics.

“Even ‘the way a candidate
fills out an application indicates
his or her seriousness,’ Terry
said. ‘The application suggests
and gives the candidate

Terry cited qualities of
having a positive attitude
towards the college. willingness
to spend time with the fresh-
men, being academically
strong, involved in ex-
tracurriculars, and respectful
of campus rules as being con-
ducive to selection,

“You can't be a cop and be a
hall counselor,” said Terry.
“Neither can you be either
lassiez faire or authoritarian as
a hall counselor.

“The major difference in the
selection process this year from
last year is that we involved all
hall counselors on the selection
committee last year.”’ Terry in-
dicated. ‘‘This year we're much
more structured.”

In addition, all members of
the selection committee read
the applications and are present
for the candidate interviews,
according to Terry.

“One thing which has im-
pressed me is the fact that guys
who in the past have had good
hall counselors are most
anxious to be hall counselors.
and are often the best." he said.

Tt weoare gomp to consider

Spencer said there were
several alternatives for the
future of the football program
“We can put all football grants

cat Club supplement this with
money from its funds.” he said.

Spencer noted that this would

Humanities Money Available

For Further Intensive Study

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Asst. Managing Editor

The Youth Grants’ in
Humanities Program offers a
rare opportunity for intense
study in numerous areas of in-
terest.

According to a pamphlet on
the subject. the National En-
dowment for the Humanities,
which sponsors the program. is
a government funded operation

that is “fundamentally con-
cerned with restoring
humanistic knowledge as a

guide to our personal and civic
lives.”

The Youth Grant Program
provides money for those voung
people (in or out of school) who
Want to pursue a certain aspect
ot the humanities.

Vice President for Academic

Affairs John M. Bevan said that
this year the organization will
give out about $31 million to ac-
cepted applicants. Normally,
the grants are under $5000. but
grants up to $10,000 may be
given.

Projects that may be ac-
cepted are those concerned with
formal or informal education,
study or research of a specific
problem. or activities that ap-
ply humanistic material to
ethical, social or political
problems.

The National Council on the
Humanities will give priority to
projects concerned with man’s
relationships in such areas as
urbanization, minority
problems. war. peace, foreign
policy. civil liberties, and youth
problems.

Bevan emphasized that the
program will accept only
specific projects: it is not in-
tended to be a scholarship or
fellowship fund. Also, group
projects are generally favored
over individual ones.

Applications must be mailed
no later than May 19 for pro-
jects beginning after Sept. 1.
More information can be ob-
tained from Bevan’s office.

Bevan is somewhat disap-
pointed with student response to
the Youth Grant Program. He
said that the announcement has
been posted since the Fall term,
but no one has shown much in-
terest init, Speaking of such an-
houncements Bevan added.
“Its a matter of people
becoming acquainted with
them.”
