: A REVIEW

By SCOTT DAVIDSON
News Editor

With Mart Crowley's ‘‘The
Boys in the Band,"’ the Col-
lege Union has finally book-
ed a winner, a real winner.
The splendid off-Broadway
drama has been meticulous-
ly transmitted to the screen
completely intact.

A birthday party, attended
by eight homosexuals and
one (maybe) heterosexual,
is held over the length of an
evening. The guests partici-

pate in the fun and games.

The drama concerns ho-
mosexuals, but it takes ho-
mosexuality for granted, ac-
cepts it as a way of life.
What one finds is conflict,
not among an_ individual
group of homosexuals, but
among a group of individ-
uals who are drawn togeth-
er by the unique trait of
their homosexuality.

Crowley's play strips
away the pretensions of its
characters, slowly and pain-
fully, until all that remains
is the truth—stark, vicious,
glaring, unfettered by glitt-
ering facades. It is all so
adamant, so uncompromis-
ing, that its very pessimism
produces an almost sattisfac-

tory acceptance of life.

In the making of the mo-
vie, an almost unprecedent-
ed event took plaée. With
the exception of the directo-
rial command, all the tal-
ents that were involved in
making such a success of
the stage version were pre-
vailed upon to repeat their
respective roles in the cine-
matic transformation. For
this, we can be truly grate-

fUleey

The acting shows the ad-
vamages of years of total
submersion in_the role. This
troupe performed together
in their original off-Broad-
way environ, and then took
the show to London. And it
shows.

It would be unfair to judge
the actors seperately, for
to praise one might be to
slight another. Each is mag-
nificent in his own role, but
they are part of a carefully
drilled team.

(Mart Crowley has written
a screenplay that is witily
ascerbic, bitingly droll. It
demonstrates his technical
coordination with language
and his facility for under-
standing the human experi-
ence,

‘The only newcomer _ is

William Friedkin, the direc- .

tor. Following in Robert
‘Moore's footsteps, he has
maintained the mood and

‘feel of the original.

“The Boys in the Band”
is, for my money, the movie
of the year. It doesn’t de-
monstrate the cinematic in-
novation of a ‘Nichols pro-
duct, but its dramatic pro-
ficiency is unequaled. It is
the type of film that leaves
you feeling weak and emo-
tionally drained. Its pre-
sence on our campus is a
distinction to the’ tastes of
the movie council. See it
once, and just marvel at the
impact of it all. Then see
it again and again, and re-
vel ‘in its brilliance.

A note to voyeurs: This
is an. extremely - mature,
tasteful movie. Do not come
expecting to be titillated!

Fraternities To Bid Dec. 5

By DAVID GRISSETT
Managing Editor

A representative group of
many .of the fraternities in-
volved in the recent open
house program have _ pre-
sently “set rush plans. for
the first week of winter
term.. ‘Rush parties are
scheduled for Nov. 30, Dec.
1, 3 and 4, Bids will be dis:
tributed on Dec. 5.

Lyman Parragin, spokes-
man for the group, said that
at least 6 houses will be par-
ticipating,’’ and that there
would ‘‘possibly be more.”

Last Thursday evening
seven of the fraternities on

Patterson Court held open
house for this year’s fresh-
man.

Parragin termed the open
house .‘‘a success by all the
houses involved.”

Parragin indicated that
about 150 freshmen partici-
pated according to reports
that he had received from
the seven houses,

“This turnout was quite
good since there was a play,
freshman football game and
a movie going on at the
same time,” said’ Parragin.

The fraternities which par-
ticipated in the open house
last week were Phi Delta
Theta, Sigma Phi Epsilon,

A second open house _ is
planned for November 18
between 9 and 11 p.m.

Paragin explained that
there was some difficulty in
getting the freshmen to move
around. ‘‘That’s the reason
for the second open house.
It is also hoped that fresh-
men who couldn’t participate
last time will be able to the
second time.”

When asked about the
over-all effects. of the open
house, Parragin .said that
all involved" agreed ‘‘that
the open houses were a lot
more relaxed and there was
better participation than had
been_ expected.”

PLANNING THE FUTURE
Bevan discusses Extended Studies with Sophomores.

Bevan Meets Sophomores

the assembled sophomore
class to discuss the changes
currently in progress with
regard to Extended Studies.

The meeting drew about
55 sophomores.

Bevan began the discussion
by making the point that
there is a need for more
flexibility -in most academic
programs.

Some provisions of the in-
itial plan are that Extended
Studies work shall be com-
parable in quality and quan-
tity to work in a regular
course and that the work
should be -taken in ~ some
area separate from the stu-
dent’s major. Consequently,
Extended Studies could serve
as a ‘‘sampling” area to
help the student decide a
major.

Another provision of the
report is that Extended
Studies work shall be avail-
able during all three terms.
Bevan intimated that some
of the reading programs

‘might be offered during the

summer.
Bevan presented five op-
tions for the program._One

optién is a reading program
wherein a_ student .reads
from a bibliography com-
piled by one of the area com-
mittees. Each committee is
then responsible for de-
termining its own _ testing
procedures.

Another of these options
is one regular course taken
on a pass-fail basis. -Begin-
ning with this year’s fresh-
man class only one such
course will be allowed dur-
ing the first two years.

Another option is a sem-
inar open to the college as
a whole. These would gen-
erally be conducted in areas
not presently covered by re-
gular courses.

The fourth program option
is a series of concerts, shows,
plays, movies, or readings,
supplemented with outside
reading. Again each~ area
committee would be respon-
sible for testing procedures.

The final option is a pro-
ject done by. the student.
These projects would be on a
contract. basis with a parti-
cular professor. Most would
be-of-the-student’s-choosing.

... Clodfelter Condemns

nosis (a disease common to
textile workers) even exist-
ed at their plants.” ‘

A second failing that Clod-
felter mentioned ‘was the
failure of the companies to
permit the formation of.
unions.

The Stevens Company was
‘‘a notorious union-buster,”’
having had many decisions

‘decided against them by the

‘Nationai Labor Board.

“‘By contrast, such an in-
credible loyality existed
among Cannon ‘employees
that no such crude devices

were needed to prevent
unionization."’ he .comment-.
ed.

Speaking about -the tele-
vision show he said, ‘‘As/far
as taping the documentary
was concerned, the com-

pany was very uncoopera- ©

tive. We. received many re-
buttals on requests. for in-
terviews with company offi-

‘blacks’

cials."

The television program it-
self had one telling filmed
scene where an unidentified
official was heard to turn
down Clodfelter’s request
for an interview.

Clodfelter did add that the
workers themselves were
extremely cooperative, and
said exactly what they felt.

On the positive side, Clod-
felter admitted that both
towns had a fairly high
standard of living.

Using. Kannapolis as an
example, he said that since
the Cannon company owned
the town, they provided good
streets, sidewalks (except
in the black district), a
YMCA, and contributions to
schools and churches.

\Another factor present was
the __ increased —-hiring ——of~
blacks, Clodfelter stated. -

“While this~ helps the

economic _ status,’

there are still the problems
of discrimination, especially
in seniority and in the jobs
epen to them.”

Speaking in generalities he
said, ‘‘The power in Roa-
noke was more restrained
than I had expected. How-
ever, in Kannapolis, there
is still much influence as
exhibited in the recent
elections in which the..com-
pany had several men fa-
vorable to their, point of
view elected.

“YT think that this power
will) stay as long as Mr.
Cannon (age 79) does."’
