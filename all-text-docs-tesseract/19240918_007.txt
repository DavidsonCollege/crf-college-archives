Manager Kendrick says that it is cer-|
tain that his outfit will play the fast)
Spencer high team this season, although!
the exact date is not certain. Lexington}
high wants a game. As Gastonia will
not play Charlotte the opening game, |
September 2oth, it is not probable that|
the locals will battle the Queen City lads |
this season. The latter have their
schedule complete and it would cause
trouble to get in on their playing card
this late in the year.

It is reported that Gastonia will go to]

Pa., next Saturday and continues for a}
week.

Pairings for the qualifying round, an-
nounced tonight, show that the entries |
total 166. Ten British stars who com-
peted in the recent tournament for the
Walker cup are entered, as are four
Canadians and the champion of Panama.
The ten Americans who helped the
United States to retain the Walker cup

some of them are among the eleven for-
