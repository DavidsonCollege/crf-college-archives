Well, fellows, it seems as if we have a fine football team
in our midst. We pla¥et an exciting game in Charlotte Sat-

is trué what they say about Harding
—then they deserve a good bit of credit. It was a swell game

to look at from the fifty if not so pretty from the bench. The

crowd loves to see a wide open game like that and when the}:

score is ‘as close as 14-13 it makes it all the more interesting.

Extra credit goes to Patterson and Barringer
for their running and to Pell and Edwards for their
defensive work. Last week we said that we were very

sorry to see Pell go. This week we are glad to see
him back. This can go on for years.

_ Right now the Red and Black Football Machine is on the
righthand side of the ledger with 20. points scored against 19
opponents points. If we keep on getting 8 points better a
game we will take Darlington on November °24. the
latest news, Darlington beat Central High of Chattanooga

33-6 and that is going some. ‘They have trampled all of their

opponents’ by like scores and.that is rapidly shaping: up as
our biggest game to come. The team will need all the sup-
port we could give it then but since it is hard to travel these
days, we are gladly giving up a ride to accommodate the team.

. And speaking of support, Jack Middey Reynal—
pardon me—Head Cheerleader Middey Reynal had
very little co-operation at the ball game the other
night. They led cheers with practically no experience.
We need sorely to get together before next game and
practice some cheers. Hows about it Jedge? Middey?

The touch football season that opened with a bang, boom-
ed a couple or more times as the star-studded SPE’s sank
the Betas 24-0 and the Pi Kaps 42-0. With Owens throwing
and running and McBride and Wilkins catching, the SPE’s
formed an unstoppable machine that’ scored at will but mostly
at the Pi Kaps. The Independents conquered thé Pikas 12-0,
thanks to Bill Simpson’s 90 yard return of Lassiter’s kickoff.
The hurricane rained out the Pika-Beta game scheduled on
Friday and it was played Monday, the Betas winning 18-0.
