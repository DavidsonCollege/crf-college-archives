tion is the only forum on campus for ex-
tended commentary on pertinent issues.
We will print opinions on any subject of
general interest we receive from the cam-
pus community. We adhere to the follow-
ing guidelines:

. +Any opinion should be in to us by 7
p.m. the Monday before publication, un-

which case it is due 5 p.m. Tuesday.

“We accept first those opinions on
IBM 5.25” diskette. Typed and legibly-
written articles will be considered later.

-Opinions should be signed. We will
only print unsigned ones if there is acom-
pelling reason and the author is known to

- us (the editors).

“We will.not edit opinions for content
or style, but for common English usage
only. We will inform the author of sub-
stantial changes.

‘Because of limited space, some-
times we are not able to print all opnions

“submitted in one issue. We reserve the

———fess itis typed on TBM'S-25" diskette, in —2°Ne@L interest, but we will adhere to the

right to select articles from those we re-
ceive for publication. First priority will
go to those articles received ‘on IBM
5.25” diskette. We will attempt to print
any withheld article the following week.

The Davidsonian welcomes ‘letters from
its readers. We try to print all letters of

following guidelines:

‘The letters must be submitted by 7
p-m. the Tuesday before expected publi-
cation date.

‘The letters must be neatly typed or
on IBM 5.25” diskette.

‘The letters should be signed. You
must have a conipelling reason if you do
not want your name printed with the let-
ter.

We reserve the right not to print let-
ters which are advertisements, contain
inside jokes or off-color slurs, or repre-
sent a viewpoint very sitnilar to other let-
ters printed on the same topic.
