Each of the questioned was asked
to-consider this quesvion, both irom
the standpoint of the Treshmen and
of the fraternities, and to give any
other criticism of the rushing sys-
tem.

“Colin” Shaw Smith, Senior:

“While our rushing season ist
ideal, in our size school, to .delay

until the second semester would be:

disadvantageous. especially from
the (reshman’s standpoint. The fra-

David King, Junior:

Considering our particular situa-

several months more of fraternity
