Students Help Renovate
Building For Ada Jenkins
Community Center

By Tom Price

Several student organizations
have been helping Davidson Pres-
byterian Church renovate a build-
ing which will soon become the
Ada Jenkins Community Center.
Habitat for Humanity, the Solidar-
ity Committee and Davidson To-
gether have each volunteered time
on the past several Saturdays.

Reverend Bob Shirley is pas-
tor of Davidson Presbyterian
Church and will serve as the com-
munity center’s director. The
center will be the headquarters for
a Boy Scout troop, a drama pro-
gram, a lay counseling program,
career development programs and
programs for the elderly. Shirley
has emphasized that the center is
for the town and not just for
Davidson Presbyterian Church.

Shirley wants Davidson College
students to play an active role in
these programs.- :

Sam Adams, co-chairman of
Davidson Together, has been very
pleased with the number of stu-
dents who have been willing to do

“volunteer work at the center. He

says that on each Saturday they
have had approximately 25 work-
ers and one Saturday there were
upwards of 50. The students have
been painting the inside of the
center and doing other renovation
work. ‘
