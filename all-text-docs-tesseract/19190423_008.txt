pionship in Field Day meet, scoring 46

Juniors last with 11 points, ten of which
were made by McQueen.

umni, ‘The individual honors of the
meet went to Harry Murrey, ‘21, who

his old-time form winning the high jump
and pole vault. A. R. Craig proved
himself to be. the best long distance man,
winning easily the mile and two mile.

FISHERMAN'S LUCK,

A minister with two lovely girls stood
entranced by the beauties of a flowing
stream. A fisherman happening by and
mistaking the minister’s occupation, said:
“Ketchin’ many, pard?”

“T am a fisher of men,” answered the
preacher with dignity.

“Well,’ replied the fisherman, with
an admiring glance at the girls, “you
sure have the right bait.”—Montreal
Journal of Commerce.

The melancholy days have come
The saddest of the year,

The movies move to empty seats;
Each girl a lonesome dear.

The students no longer smiling
They have a careworn look,
Beneath the arm of everyone
Is found a well worn book.

Examination days are near,
The saddest one can find,

So it’s get to work, you rummy,
And grind, you bonehead, grind!

Wildcats Take Second
Game From Elon, 2 to 1

Miley Received Wonderful Support.
' Pitched | Good Game.

In the second game of the series with
Elon, Davidson came back in good form
and evened things up with their oppo-
nents, Bill Miley, pitching his first game
for the Wildcats, allowed only six scat-
tering hits and struck out six men, It
was his pitching, coupled with unusual-
ly good support on the part of his teatn-
mates which enabled Davidson to take
the big end of a 2 to t score.

Both of the Wildcats’ runs came in
the first two frames. Spann, first man
up for Davidson, walked and took sec-
ond on Miller's single to left. Cassell
laid down a neat bunt, advancing both
runners, and a moment later Spann
scored on Ratchford’s grounder. to short.
Johnson ended the scoring by grounding
to the pitcher,

In the second inning after two men
were down, Sample smacked one on the
nose for three bases and took home on
a wild peg. “Fhings looked bright again
in the fourth inning when Johnny Rich-
ards poled one to the left field fence with
nobudy out, but the hopes of the David-
son rooters quickly subsided when he
was tagged out ‘at third base.

Elon’s lone tally came in the seventh.
Johnson, the first man up beat out an
infield hit and went to second when
King singled. Marlette singled to cen-
ter, scoring Johnson and advancing King
to third, but was pegged out a moment
later trying to make secoad. Brown flied
to Ratchford and Atkinson was out on
a grounder to Sample.

In the ninth session Elon threatened
to score again on a belated rally, After
two men were out Sides, hitting for King
doubled to left center, Doughton, anoth-
er pinch hitter, ended the game by knock-
ing a long fly which Spann pulled down
in deep center,

The features of the game for David-
son were the pitching of Miley, the
fielding of Sample and the marked im-
provement in the hitting of the entire
team. Murphy was the outstanding
star for the visitors, accepting five
chances without a bobble and making
one of the six hits credited to Elon.

Trinity Wins ¢ Game Here

Davidson Loses Slugging Match to
Trinity, Score 9 to 2.

Trinity defeated Davidson in the lat-
ter’s own “backyard,” Friday, April
18th, by the score of 9 to 2. The score
by no means does Davidson justice for
she truly had the better of her opponents
in everything except the breaks of the
game up to the last spasm.

Errors by the Davidson battery and
infield boosted Trinity along mightily
and Currie was touched for many timely
hits, ‘The ninth inning proved a disas-
ter. After the scoring in this inning had
been started by Wildcat errors, the
“Bulls” helped the dirty work along by
some old-time fence “busting.”

The game went along nicely until the
ninth. Davidson had scored once and
‘Trinity four times, errors playing a
Prominent. part in the scoring of the
Methodists. ‘Then came the fatal in-
ning when the game developed into a
farce.

Tome’s single started things off in
Trinity’s half of the ninth. McArn got
mixed on Wannamaker's roller down
the first base line and all hands were
safe, Then the comedy—for some, trag-
edy—began, Hits, runs, bonehead plays
and errors happened so rapidly that a
triple shift of scorekeepers were unaqual
to their task. Seven hits, combined with
many errors of omission and commis-
sion boosted Trinity's score to nine. Fi-
nally Currie settled down and forced
Tome to pop up on his second appear-
ance in the inning and Wannamaker to
“windmill” at three fast ones for the
second and third outs.

The famous “Wildcat” fighting spirit
was never better demonstrated than in
the last half of the ninth. Although the
score was nine to one against them, they
went after the gentle slants in.a vicious
manner. Ratch slammed the first ball
pitched to him to the right field palings
for a triple. “Cop,” always ready to lend
a helping hand, scored the little second
sacker with a hefty one-ply wallop to
left. Things were beginning to boom.
Rich came up with a firm desire to
“knock a board off—and he almost did
it. for his blow to deep center looked
good for about four cushions until friend
McArthur took it.in hand. It was a
splendid catch and saved at least one
tun, for “Cop” was on his toes to give
an imaginary rabbit a swift race from
first to home, via second and third.

Cole's jealousy of his teammate’s field-
ing ability forced “Cop” to break anoth-
er pressing engagement with the home
plate and abide yet a little while in the

garden of Eden. Also it robbed Sully,
batting for McArn, of an extra base
blow. “Buck” Currie had good inten-
tions, but Carroll got the ball a scant
fraction of an inch too high and Wan-
namaker took in “Buck’s” fly for the
Wildcats’ twenty-seventh out.

The game was a slug-fest from first
to last and everybody (especially the
rinity outfielders) had a busy day.
Hathway played a beautiful game in
left field for the winners and in addi-
tion connected for three hits and of five
trips. Wannamaker at third and Edens
at first fielded excellently for the Meth-
odists.

For the Presbyterians Ratchford was
the shining light. Besides playing a good
fielding game. Ratch scored one run and
drove in the other. His three bagger in
the ninth was the batting feature of the
‘day. Johnny Richards made several nice
running catches in right. Johnson is de-
veloping into a dangerous hitter in the
pinches. He hit hard and often in Fri-
day’s game.

Umpire, Mr. Miles.

One does not realize the dangers that
surround any undertaking until he has
them set before him in some such graphic
way as the following, reported by an
exchange:

“He crossed the Atlantic twenty-seven
times and niver got drowned but wanst,”
Bridget assured her caller.

“Indade. An’ which wan of his trips
was it he was drowned on?”

“Oi’m not sure, but I think it was
the twinty-seventh.”

“He was lucky. Many a man woyld
have wint to the bottom on his first
v'yage instead of waiting till the last.”

“Right ye are. More people are
drowned by water than by railroad
wrecks.”

“It's a fatal death, begorrah.’”

NO EVIDENCE OF IT.

“Does your daughter play the piano
by ear?”

“No, she uses both hands and both
feet, but I don’t think she has learned
to use her ears.”

“Camouflage”: “Mr. Smith, can you
spell the word for Sun in Espanol ?”

Johnny didn’t know so he replied,
jokingly—‘‘S, O. L.”
