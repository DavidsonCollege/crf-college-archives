ing his sophomore campaign, when

list.

mas and returned to his Jackson-

Wildcat Wrestlers Continue to Improve

By Robert Grubb

The wrestling team grabbed
its first victory of the season witha
29-18 victory in a dual match on
January 11 against Washington and
Lee. Unfortunately, the Wildcats
also suffered a 39-11 loss to An-
derson College in the same match.

Despite the team’s 1-3 record
Coach Tom Oddo is pleased with
the performance of the team thus
far. ‘Over 80 percent of our wres-
tlers are freshmen and sophomores
which means that we are looking
to the future,” said Oddo.

“There areno standouts on this

team,” said Oddo. ‘“‘Most of the .

guys are wrestling around .500,
but they are learning by experi-
ence.”

Injuries have plagued the Wild-
cats this season. The team has
suffered two broken noses, ashoul-
der injury and a sprained ankle.
These injuries have kept Davidson
from. wrestling with its strongest
lineup.

Injuries have not stopped sen-
ior Craig Wall. Wall continues to
wrestle well, despite aserious lower
back problem which makes it pain-
ful for him to wrestle.

While there is no star, sopho-
more. Sam: Knowles managed to

capture last week’s Athlete of the

Week honors with two victories in’

matches against Washington and
Leeand Anderson. Knowles, wres-
tling in the 158 Ib. class, defeated
his W and L opponent 10-1 and
scored a 8-4 victory over what
Oddo called a strong Anderson
wrestler.

Atthe 126 1b. class sophomore
Robbie Fierro also wreslted to a2-
2 tie in his match against Ander-
son. “Robbie wrestled well against
areally toughkid from Anderson,”
said Oddo.

Another sophomore, heavy-
weight Jimmy Stewart, is also

Spear Sets 500m Record
as Men's Track Opens Indoor Season

. By Peter Hurtado

Themen’ strack and field team
opened its 1992 indoor season in
fine fashion, recording a new
school record and several other
strong performances: this past
weekend at the Santee-Marriott
Invitational at Virginia Tech.

Sophomoreco-captain Duncan
Spears continued his mastery of
- the 500 meter race, sprinting to a
68.5 and breaking his own school-

record performance of 69.3 set in
his firstrace as a freshman. Spears
will continue to chase records
indoors and outdoors in the 400m
and 400m hurdles.

Ted Richardson and Chris -

Otrok began their senior campaigns
with strong performances in the
distance events. Otrok bacame one
of Davidson’s best 5000m athletes
ever with a time of 16:18, while
co-captain Richardson flew his way

to.a 9:12 in the 3000m. Both men
hope to challenge records in the
3000m and 5000m this season, and
seem poised to do so.

In a promising first-ever in-
door race, freshman standout Erik
McMichael ran a fine mile of
4:40.2. McMichael looks to con-
tinue his success this season in the
800m and 1500m.

Lee Sutton, another outstand-

‘ing freshman athlete, put the shot

enjoying a successful year after
moving up from the 190 Ib. class to
the Heavyweight Class. “The move
to heavyweight means that Jimmy
doesn’t have to drop 20 or 30
pounds to wrestle,” said Oddo.
“The move up has really helped
him.

Davidson’s scheduled match
against Pensacola on Saturday was
cancelled by Pensacola but it may
berescheduled, according toOddo.
The Wildcats return to action on
Jan. 24 at the Washington and Lee
Tournament. Davidson. finished
second in last year’s tournament
and is considered one of the favor-

43°9 3/4" to become Davidson’s
Ath best ever in that event. Surely
Sutton will challenge records in
both the shotand discus this spring.

In other performances, Senior
John Alsobrook (2:10) and fresh-
man Joe Beach (2:11) ran well in
the 800m, while junior Pete Hur-
tado (4:50) followed McMichael
in the mile. Spears (24.2) and
sophomore DJ Ruggles (26.2)
sprinted their way to fast 200m

ites this year, along with Long-
wood and Gardner-Webb.

Oddo is hoping that the W and
L Tournament and five consecu-
tive weekends on the road will
prepare the team for the Southern
Conference Tournamentat the end
of the season.

The Davidsonian would like
to apologize. to Coach Oddo and
the wrestling team for a mistake in
an article in the Dec. 9 issue. What
was reported as a staph infection

- among members of the team was

rather a communicable skin infec-
tion.

times.

The team was pleased with
their first performances of the year.
There will be marked improve-
ment, especially in the shot putand
discus events with the arrival of
Sutton and the return of sevéral
veterans. Coaches Gary Andrew
and Beth Manson have set high
goals for this years squad.

The men will send athletes to
the US Air Invitational and to the
Lynchburg Invitational next week-
end.
