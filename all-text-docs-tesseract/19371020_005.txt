Mint Exhibits
Ingerle Group

Includes Many Landscapes of
Great Smokies

The Mint Museum in Charlotte
has at the present an interesting
and very: timely group of pictures
on exhibit. It includes landscapes
and works depicting the horrors of
war. ‘

Included in the paintings are
thirty-five portrait studies and
landscapes of the Great Smoky
Mountains by Rudolph Ingerle of
Vienna and Chicago. The pictures

show moonlight scenes in the Great

Smoky Region and also true-to-life !

studies of mountaineers. Among

the works shown are “Public

Sale.” “Restless Clouds,” “The Sil-

ver VAM,” “October in the Smok-

ies,” Patterns of the Mist,” “Moon-

lace.” “Moon Pageantry,” “Carolina

Moon,” “Mirrored Moonlight,”

“"Mount Le Conte,” “Road to Gat-
linburg,” “Past-Present,” “Salt of

the —Earth*—and+Just~a-Resting,”
Ingerle was president of the Chi-

, caza—Artists for two years, was
first president of the North Shore

Art league, and is now a director

of the Municipal, Art league. He

has served on.art juries with Rock-

well Kent, George—Bellows, Red-

Community in the Present Busi-
ness Era.” After an interesting

talk, Mr. Kerr quite willingly and
very ably answered questions pro-
posed by the audience composed of
the forty charter members of the
club and the two honorary mem-
bers,
J. S. O'Connor.

Mr. Kerr expressed his hearty
approval of the new organization,
its purposes and aims, and predict-
ed that it would be a big success
on the campus, as well as an advan-
tageous movement for those going
linto business actively._After the
meeting adjourned, Mr. Kerr «was
detained by many of the members
, who wished to make his personal
adquaintance.

The next mecting of the Kom-
merce Klub will be on the evening
of October 27th in the Phi Hall at
8 o'clock, when a man of disting-
uished career in the mercantile field
will be the speaker. It is hoped
that the ‘committee for programs
will be able to secure Mr, David
Ovens, who is manager -of Ivey's
Department Store in Charlotte and
also president of the American
Dry Goods Association.

Dr. C. R. Harding, of the David-

“son College - Faculty, reierred to
Mr. Ingerle’ as a conservative im-

to the colder classic or academic !
schools, but who does not go~into
the extremes of Modern Abstrac-

“Fheevery fact that the scenes are
