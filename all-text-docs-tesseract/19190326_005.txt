Mr. Ostrum Discusses
The Japanese Problem

Returned Missionary Spends Two Days
On Campus.

The students of Davidson were for-
tunate in having Mr. H. C. Ostrum
with them for a day and night of last
week, Mr. Ostrum was for some time
a missionary in Japan, being stationed at
Tokushima, but poor health compelled
him to return to this country. For: the
past two years he has been Secretary of
the Laymen's Missionary Movement of
the Southern Presbyterian Church, and
is doing a very important work in Amer-
ica; however, he hopes that he will svon
be able to return to Japan.

On ‘Tuesday ‘night Mr. Ostrum spuke
to the Student Forum at the gymnasium.
After speaking briefly of his work in
Japan, Mr. Ostrum outlined the pro-
gram which has been adopted by most
of the Protestant Churches of America
According to.this plan, the Home and
Foreign Mission Boards of all these
churches will combine in a drive some-
what like that made during the United
War Work Campaign. Conferences will
be held in all the leading cities of tac
country and it is hoped that nearly a hil-
lion dollars can be raised within the next
twelve months,

On Wednesday morning Mr. Ostrim
spoke briefly to the student body at
chapel. -He showed that Japan is already
one of the most influential nations a+ the
world and that she is steadily increasing
in power. If we can win Japan for
Christ the entire Orient will follow. He
appealed to all the students to consider
whether they would not devote their lives
to Christianizing that country.

That evening he delivered a short ad-
dress before the Volunteer Band. He
pointed out some of the ways of keeping
up a live band and specially urged that
all the Volunteers should keep up with
nems of missionary interest. In closing.
ne suggested that a Missionary Day, on
which missionaries from the — various
fields could speak to the students, should
be observed at Davidson.

We have all noted and appreciated the
improvements made on the campus last
week. The work on the outdoor gym-
nasium. was very beneficial in that the
appearance and durability is greatly im-
proved,

The same may be said concerning the
vilding of other iron fixtures on the hill.
It is surprising how much these additions
help the appearance of the campus.
