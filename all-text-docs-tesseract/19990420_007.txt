Student production of Jesus

TUESDAY, APRIL 13, 1999 eA

Christ Superstar shines

By Setu Davis
Arts & Living Editor

As the rehearsals promised, the Davidson
student production of Jesus Christ Superstar de-
livered. There were four showings of the rock
opera. I attended the Saturday, April 18", show-
ing. The first thing, not unexpectedly, that I
noticed upon entering Love Auditorium, was the
stage. Reminiscent of the feeling of the movie
version of Superstar, the stage consisted of two
columns supporting a platform at the center of the
stage. On the left
and right of the
stage stairs led up
to the platform. A
great portion of the
platform, in be-
tween the columns
and near the stairs,
was draped in
painted sheets.

lights, seemed to
change colors, at
times accented in
browns and
greens, at other
times showing a
fuller range of
color.

The musical began with the playing of the
“orchestra”, seated in front of the stage. This
orchestra was not a classic one in that this rock
opera requires drums and guitars. Music intro-
duced Superstar but was only one important com-
ponent of its success. Another important compo-
nent of the musical’s success, both at Davidson
and in other pro-
ductions, is the

inner-workings. Within the opening minutes of
the musical. Judas stands apart, questioning Jesus
and his followers. He questions Jesus’ divinity,
which, it seems, is one of questions posed to the
audience by the musical, Judas’ betrayal of Jesus
is seen in Superstar as a misguided desire to save
his people and do the right thing.

Will Ragland’s portrayal of Pontius Pilate
was compelling. Looking very much the Roman
governor, Ragland’s Pontius Pilate was a man
visibly torn between his qualified pity for Jesus
and his desire to placate the angry crowd. This
view of Pontius
Pilate is not radi-
cal, yet Ragland
was able to bring
forth both
Pilate’s imperi-
ous manner and
pity (however ar-
rogant) for Jesus.

Pilate’s
view of Jesus dif-
fers greatly from
M ar. gy
Magdalene’s.
Mary Magdalene
is another central
character in the
musical. She is
certainly a “hu-
man” character,
strikingly fal-
lible. Anna McDonald’s performance of Mary
Magdalene made one forget the Biblical account
of Mary Magdalene’s life and sin. In this powerful
performance, Mary Magdalene was an innocent,
seemingly untainted, desiring to love Jesus and
recognizing the wonder of him. One of the high-
lights of musical was her rendition, with Jesus
(Steven
Meriwether), of “I

speaking, as told in

Itseems thatthe musical makes an attempt
to humanize Jesus while prompting the
audience to question, or, at least, look at
his story from a new perspective.

the Gospels. Su-

perstar is mindful of its contemporary. and unique
nature. For example, in the Davidson student
production, Herod (Bill Stoops) came on stage
dressed in an animal-print dress and emphasized
makeup. He was attended by four dancers, Brooke
Weihe, Monica Costlow, Erin Smith, and Chas
Willimon. Weihe, Costlow, and Smith were all
clad in black negliges. Willimon, the odd man out,
was wearing black pants and a black vest-like top.

From the unusual perspective of Superstar
comes some interesting interpretations of the story
of Jesus. The musical paints a human portrait of
Jesus. He is, at one moment, adored by the crowd
who asks “what’s the fuss,” and, at another mo-
ment, “just a man.” It seems that the musical
makes an attempt to humanize Jesus while prompt-
ing the audience to question or, at least, look at his
story from a new perspective.

In the light of its different take on the tale of
Jesus, some of the characters are taken beyond, or
in a different direction from their Biblical “coun-
terparts.”’ Judas (Austin Rios) is perhaps the best
example. The audience sees a great deal of his

was another one of
the highlights of the musical.

It is, of course, Jesus whom the play focuses
on, and Steve Meriwether’s performance brought
forth a sometimes confused, sometimes angry,
and sometimes doubtful Jesus (such as the
Gethsemane scene). In short, Meriwether’s Jesus
was ahuman one. His portrayal fufilled the role of
Jesus in the musical. Meriwether showed the
audience a Jesus that was compassionate and char-
ismatic and great and human at the same time. In
particular, his solo performance of the Gethsemane
scene stood out as one of the most powerful in the
musical.

Those who missed the Davidson student’s
production of Jesus Christ Superstar missed an
emotionally charged performance of the famous
musical. Director Chase Bringardner, Vocal Di-
rector Maurie Ponder, producer Nick Dancik, Band
directors Ross Hagen and Chad Diamond, and all
the cast and crew (especially Ben Garrison, ouch)
made this production a success. Those who did see
it, at least on Saturday night, were on their feet at
the end of the show. That, I think, is enough said.

Here’s a few Earth facts

According to the U.S. EPA, more than
25% of the nation’s children live in areas
that do not meet national or air quality
standards.

One leaky faucet can use up to 4000 gallons of
water per month.

In 1996, water pollution prompted more than
2500 closings and swimming advisories at
beaches around the country.

Each year, about 78,000 square miles of tropical
rain forest are destroyed,
