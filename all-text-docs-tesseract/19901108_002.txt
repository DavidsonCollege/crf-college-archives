Reasoner Reflects On
"Tragic" U.S. Policy

By JAY CHAUDHURI

In ‘his shoft-sleeved ‘cotton
stripped shirt and blue pants, Don
Reasoner sits comfortably in his
chair. The air-conditioning hums
and the weather is pleasant out-
side. Reasoner is no longer in
Nicaragua.

After spending seven years in
the humid country of Nicaragua,
Reasoner is currently training in
Atlanta to become a Methodist
missionary there. Recently, he
visited Davidson to discuss the
“The Sandinista Revolution in
Nicaragua.” The lecture was spon-
sored by the Dean Rusk program,
the Committee on Public Lectures
and the History department. _

“In Nicaragua there was a
shortage of food,” commented
Reasoner, who experienced a pe-
riod of culture shock after return-
ing to the U.S. “Going into the
grocery store here I see everything
in overabundance. I am depressed
at the level of materialism.”

Reasoner’s visit to Davidson
stemmed from the contact made
by professors David Kaylor and
Brian Shaw, who organized the
trip to Guatemala and Nicaragua
last May that included 15 Davidson
students and faculty members.
Reasoner was one. of the several
lecturers who spoke to the group.
He has established the Center for
International Dialogue in Nicara-
gua and briefed scores of groups
coming to the country. Reasoner
also has numerous personal con-
tacts with Nicaraguans of all po-
litical persuasions and walks of
life.

Reasoner sees the current po-
litical situation in Nicaragua as
being ‘very explosive” as a result
of failed government promises and

the contras, who still have arms.
“If the situation explodes,” said

“Reasoner, ‘it not be'the same war.

There will be a reshifting of-alli-
ances.” Manycontras, forexample,
feel more disillusioned with UNO
(the coalition Nicaraguan govern-
ment) than the Sandinistas.

The principle conflict in the
scenario is the demand for land
reform. “You have 50,000-60,000
peasants who are hungry and have
no land. With the government
taking land from the peasants and
giving them to land owners, the
explosive situation is worst,” said
Reasoner.

The U.S, according to Rea-
soner, “has been committing a
historic and tragic mistake.” With
the election of the Reagan admini-
stration, the governmentreasserted
U.S. domination of the world as its
policy rather than observing what
the Sandinistas were doing. “A lot
of the U.S. policy was based on
geopolitical symbolism,” said
Reasoner. “I feel Reagan and oth-
ers saw it is a zero-sum equation:
our loss, the Soviet’s gain. If the
contras would have won the war,
we would have had a bloodbath
that would have made Chile look
small. The Sandinistas were not
anti-American, but anti-imperial-
ists, The U.S. policy promotes more
instability. U.S. interests looses
out in the long and short term.”

Reasoner’s perspective to the
Nicaragua’s problem developed
from the international atmosphere
in which he was raised. As Profes-
sor Ralph Levering of history notes,
“Don was bom. international.”
Reasoner grew up in Brazil where
his parents were Presbyterian mis-
sionaries. After graduating with a

Panel Holds Discussion

On Women's Issues 1n Politics

By SANDRA SMITH

The sobering truth about
women’s issues in politics is re-
ported by the Women’s Agenda
Project of N.C. Equity, acenter for
public policy research and advo-
cacy for women.

The Project says that in the
United States the greatest cause of
injury to womenis domestic abuse,
inadequate public health leaves
four million women without con-
tact with family planners and
women and children are the fastest
growing segment of the homeless
population.

According to the Project, the
United States is one of only two in-
dustrialized nations not having
partially paid maternally-related
benefits. South Africa is the other.

The women and men who at-

~ tended last Thursday night’s panel

discussion on women’s issues in
politics were urged to understand

the importance of how these and
other concerns facing women are
political issues.

The focus of the discussion,
sponsored by the Women’s Con-
cerns Committee, was on how
local, state and federal govern-
ments are addressing women’s
issues such as medical care, child
care, abortion and equality in the
work place, and how interest groups
such as the Women’s Political
Caucus and the N.C. Women’s
Legislative Agenda are working
for appropriate legislation and
funding.

Members of the panel included
June Kimmel, regional director of
the N.C. Council on the Status of
Women, professor Tom Kazee of
the Political Science department at
Davidson, and Rollin Shaw, county
commissioner of Cumberland
County.

According to the panel, budget
restraints are the primary block

towards funding most programs,
but monetary resources are not the
only deterrent to mandating legis-
lation on women’s issues. Bills
such as the recently vetoed Civil
Rights Bill and the-Family—and
Medical Leave Act required no
increase in budget expenditures if
passed. Shaw stated that there is a
lack of a sense of urgency among
lawmakers concerning women’s
issues. All three panelists agreed
on the necessity for organized ef-
forts suchas the Women’s Agenda
Project to work for support on
women’s concerns, particularly at
the state level where most women’s
issues are legislated.

Kazee stressed the power of
the voter on electionday, and stated
most confidently that if advocates
want results they should vote for
the Democratic Party, which has
traditionally responded more sym-
pathetically towards women’s is-
sues.

Local Ministries Review Survey of
Poverty In "The Other Charlotte”

By LISA GERRARD

It was a difficult decision, but
it opened his eyes to another side
of town.

Last winter a Charlotte lawyer
agreed to: help with a survey in
three low-income: neighborhoods
in Charlotte. In the first home he
visited, a two-room duplex, he say

five children, aged seven or under,

huddled around a kerosene heater
with their 22-year old mother and
her boyfriend, who were both out
of work.

“Tt was a real eye- opener,” *he
said, “one that I think will help me
inourchurch’s housing committee
in trying to tackle some of the
problems that these communities
face.”

The lawyer was one of several
volunteers who helped the recently
Davidson graduate Douglas Hicks

“and Economics professor Charles

Ratliff with their study on poverty
in the Queen City early this year.

Ratliffused the results to write
“Poverty in the Midst of Plenty,” a

poignant, profile of Charlotte’s
poor. His report was recently dis-
tributed to 105 churches at a meet-
ing of the interdenominational
organization Mecklenburg Minis-
tries. A spokesperson for Meck-

lenburg Ministries said, “We hope °

that congregations, in reading the
report, will see the real human
needs in Charlotte.”

Ratliff’s report delves into
statistics of the “other Charlotte,”
compiling data from 63 randomly
chosen householders in Belmont,
Sieversville and Wilmore, three
low-income neighborhoods in
downtown Charlotte. “Respon-
dents realize that they live in the
‘other Charlotte’ and are fully
aware that conditions in other ar-
eas of the ‘royal’ city are much
better,” said Ratliff.

A firm believer in the power of
religious groups to combat pov-
erty, Ratliff wrote that “Judeo-
Christian institutions can make a
tremendous contribution by mak-
ing members aware of the prob-
lems of poverty...proposing

solutions...and facilitating a grass-
roots, groundswell movement to
direct social change.”

Nearly atenth of the citizens in
the county are estimated to live on
incomes below the official poverty
threshold, said Ratliff, but Meck-
lenburg boasts the’ hi ghest per
capita income of any county in the
state, at $18,900 in 1988, and ithas
one of the nation’s lowest unem-
ployment rates, at 2.8 percent in
August 1990.

The gap between Charlotte’s
rich and poor has long concerned
this “‘country-boy” professor from
Anson County. Ratliff’s work with
Mecklenburg Ministries and other

“community action groups has taken

him into neighborhoods that startle
and depress him.

“Tttakes me a while to get over
what I’ve seen each time I go into
one of these homes,” he said.

Almost half of the households
involved in the study fell below the
poverty line. A third of the group

tertaining and surprising oratorand
an excellent storyteller.” -
