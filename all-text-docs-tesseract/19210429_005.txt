| What Makes the Firefly Glow?

OU can hold a firefly in your hand; you can boil

water with an electric lamp. Nature long ago evolved

the “cold light.” The firefly, according to Ives and
Coblentz, radiates ninety-six percent light and only four
percent heat. Man’s best lamp radiates more than ninety
percent heat.

An English physicist once said that if we knew the fire-
fly’s secret, a boy turning a crank could light up a whole
street. Great as is the advance in lighting that has been
made through research within the last twenty years, man
wastes far too much energy in obtaining light.

This problem of the ‘‘cold light’’ cannot be solved merely
by trying to improve existing power-generating machinery
and existing lamps. We should still be burning candles if
chemists and physicists had confined their researches to the
improvement of materials and methods for making candles.

For these reasons, the Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company are not limited in the scope of
their investigations. Research consists in framing questions
of the right kind and in finding the answers, no matter
where they may lead.

What makes the firefly glow? How does a firefly’s light
differ in color from that of an electric arc, and why? The
answers to such questions may or may not be of practical
value, but of this we may be sure—it is by dovetailing the
results of “theoretical” investigations along many widely
separated lines that we arrive at most of our modern
“‘practical’’ discoveries.

What will be the light of the future? Will it be like that
of the firefly or like that of the dial on a luminous watch?
Will it be produced in a lamp at present undreamed of, or
will it come from something resembling our present incan-
descent lamp? The answers to these questions will depend
much more upon the results of research in pure science than
upon strictly commercial research.
