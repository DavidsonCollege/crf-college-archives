THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 4, 1933

MANY ALUMNI TO
RETURN TO SEE
FOOTBALL GAME

Interest Is Aroused by Brilliant
Showing of Wildcats Against
Carolina

LUNCHEON AT 12:30

Several Other Features Are on
Homecoming Program

Indications are that a large crowd
of alumni will return to the campus
for the Homecoming festivities on Oc-
tober 21st, when Davidson’s scrapping
Wildcats face the powerful Duke Uni-
versity eleven,

Davidson exhibited last Saturday a
typical fighting team, and presented a
line which out-charged and out-fought
a reputedly. superior forward wall.
Playing without Mackorell, star triple
threat man, the team held the Tar
Heels to a 6-0 score, following predic-
tions by most sports authorities that
Davidson would be swamped by the
might and force of the North, Caro-
linians,

Already numerous requests for res-
ervations are being received, and it
appears that one of the largest crowds
ever to see a Homecoming game will
be on hand for the battle on Octo-
ber 21st.

Besides the football game there are
several features on the program for
returning alumni and their friends. In
the morning at 11 o’clock, the David-
son cross-country team will engage the
Duke runners. Immediately following
this will be a short meeting of the
alumni in the auditorium of Chambers
Building, at which time a short address
of welcome will be given, and some
music will be rendered. Following this,
at 12:30, there will be a luncheon in
the banquet hall of the Chambers
Building, to which all alumni are in-
vited. The concert orchestra, under
the direction of Mr. James C. Pfohl,
the new music director, will play at
this hour. :

After an intermission of about an
hour, the football game will hold the
spotlight.
