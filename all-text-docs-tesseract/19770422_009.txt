10st Union social events.

week after week or leave
campus, complaining loudly in
either instance.

The Union Board Executive
Committee (UBEC), the prin-
ciple programmers for the
campus, profess to welcome
student input, but they either
ignore or reject most propo-
safs. Even the Committee
chairmen have problems work-
ing through (or around) the
UBEC so that’ they may
program.

Instead of providing leader-
ship for both the Union Board
and the students the UBEC
functions as a stumbling
block.

(Hunter Jennings)

Committee chairpeople have
to avoid the UBEC to get
anything done. Externally the
UBEC appears to be hard at
work, putting in two or three
hours every afternoon in C.
Shaw Smith’s offi€e to ‘“‘pro-
gram’’.

The business transacted in
these meetings might take
fifteen minutes if handled
efficiently. The sessions turn
into gripe sessions, forcing
people seriously interested in
programming from getting
anything done.

Very little communication
exists between the UBEC and
the Committee chairmen. No
agenda is available before
Board. meetings and the
UBEC members seem to re-
sent the fact that Board
members are interested in
what they will discuss before-
hand.

work is supposed to be a fun
experience and this is usually
the case for those who do
participate.

Hutchings’says that ano-
ther problem related to the
difficulty of student participa-
tion is that the Union is not
the only source of extracurri-
cular function on campus.
Some success has been ach-
ieved in making the Union
Davidson’s social-cultural
center. He acknowledges,
though, that the Wnion does
experience some limited ‘‘com-
petition’’ from terson
Court.

However, the Court social
system is not completely in its
range of activities. This is
where the UBEC sees the
Union fitting in, to fill in these
gaps and even to be an
alternative to the Court when
someone is looking for some-
thing different to see or do.

The point that the members
of the UBEC emphasize the
strongest is that it takes the
students to make the Union

oMmittes..what they think it should he.

a

They encourage students to
get involved with the Union so
that it can realize its potential
as the socio-cultural center of
Davidson College.

College Union and the cam-
pus, works in strange ways.

While professing to welcome
student input the body turns
away suggestions.

The UBEC serves as one
more frustrating element in
Davidson College, and they
should be relieving frustra-
tion. -

Students did elect these
people, students should de-
mand the UBEC meet their
needs.

Solicited students respond to
Union’s programming policy

The Davidsonian solicited
student opinion of the College
Union. The following state-
ments are a sample of the
responses:

“It's a right nice hole.”

‘‘T like it. It’s better than
not having a union.”’

‘‘T think they’re doing a
great deal of progress and
offering a variety of things.”

‘‘We need more music in the
900 Room. They have, those
super speakers and they never
turn them on.”

“T think the 900 Room
should be open until 3:00.”’

“First tell me.what they’re
doing.”’

‘Well, I have this to say
about the Union, I think it’s
very unionized and I’m glad I
am at Davidson College and
God is alive.”’

“They’re acting like they’re
not spending any money.”

“The groups they’ve had in
the 900 Room are pretty
shitty.”

“T want to be able to drink
beer anywhere in the Union.”

“Union? What Union?”’

‘We do have a snack bar.”’

“The Union is doing a fine
job now.”

“T don’t think the students
use it enough.”

‘‘T wish they’d keep the

“Tt’s been adequate, but not
exceptional. We haven't had
any good concerts since fall
term..’

‘‘[nadequate facilities for
concerts are partly to blame,
also inadequate student body
to finance and draw really
good: concerts;

‘Several years ago the con-
cert committee was less reluc-
tant to ‘gamble’ in rising
people or different types of
music (ex.: Dave Brubeck,
Muddy Waters, etc.).”’

“‘T think it’s been OK. I
think they’ve gone out of their

way to decorate the Union and
give it atmosphere. I really
liked that Indian dinner. |
wish they wouldn't orient all
of their programs around drin-
