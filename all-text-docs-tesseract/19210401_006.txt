LINDSAY PATTERSON
Well-Known Lawyer

Lindsay Patterson was born on May
16, 1858, at Blandwood, the residence of
Governor Morehead in Greensboro, N.
C. He attended the primary schools at
Satem, then went to the Finley High
School at Lenoir. He entered Davidson
in 1874 and graduated in 1878, standing

a, second in his class. His merit is shown

in making this stand when among his
classmates were James W. Osborne, Dr.
W. W. Moore, Charles M. Hepburn,
Henry E. Fries and F. M. Williams, all
of whom have taken a high rank in the
world.

After graduating at Davidson Mr. Pat-
terson studied law and passed his ex-
amination in 1881. He located in Win-
ston-Salem, where he has since resided.
Hardly had he begun practice before he
‘was elected solicitor of the county
criminal court. In 1888 he married Miss
Lucy Patterson, of Philadelphia, and
their home has since been a great liter-
ary center for North Carolinians. Mrs.
Patterson conceived the design of pro-
moting literature in North Carolina by
offering a massive and costly cup to be
presented each year to the North Caro-
lina writer who achieves the greatest
literary success for that year.

Mr. Patterson is a Democrat of the
old school. In 1896 he was elector-at-
large fot North Carolina in the Chicago
Convention and in 1902 ran as unsuccess-
ful candidate for Congress against Hon.
W. W. Kitchen, of the Fifth District.
Mr. Patterson ranks among the ablest
lawyers of the State, and being yet in
his prime, no doubt the future will be
one of distinguished successes in his

profession and of usefulness to his
people.

far larger circulation than any other
book ever written in America on Presby-
terianism. The new edition contains
lesson divisions with questions for each
lesson, thus converting it into a text-
