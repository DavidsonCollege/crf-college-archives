Senior Michael Hart sequences DNA

By Jerrrey COKER

While most students spent
their summer trying to escape
Davidson academia, Dr. Malcolm
Campbell and senior Michael Hart
were pushing it to new levels.

Their research with the algae
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii marks
the first time that DNA has been
sequenced at Davidson College.

Davidson joins an exclusive
group of small colleges including
Grinnell, Carleton and Williams
which possess this technology.

Because so few colleges and
universities are sequencing DNA
in classes, Davidson students have

a rare opportunity.

“Now we can do real research
at the undergraduate level,” said
Hart. “It’s a big step for the biol-
ogy department and for the sci-
ences in general.”

Another professor added, “A
few years ago we would have been
turning backflips in the hallway to
have this technology. Now that
it’s here [Campbell and Hart] are
low key about the whole thing. . .
but it’s still a big deal.”

Students in Dr. Campbell’s
advanced molecular classes will
now be able to sequence DNA
themselves, though under close
supervision. Campbell said cau-
tiously that “we’re not quite ready

to use it in the general classes.
Sequencing is the only thing we
can’t do non-radioactively, so it’s
better to take it slow because of
safety considerations.”

Dr. Campbell and others in-
volved in the DNA project are
working with Dr. Ginger Armbrust
of the University of Washington-
Seattle, who has sent DNA to
Davidson to be duplicated and
checked for the GA-1 locus.

This piece of DNA codes fora

, protein that is crucial for

Chlamydomonas reproduction, but
is not yet fully understood.
Campbell was recently fea-
tured in The Journal of NIH Re-
search, has spoken at a National

Michael Hart and Malcom Campbell work together on DNA.

Davidson.

From front page headlines to

_ extensive coverage in the sports

section, news of Davidson College
graces newspapers nationwide. But
last spring the school entered
unchartered territory: Davidson

. College appeared in the funnies.

Funnies fans first glimpsed
Davidson in the well known syndi-
cated comic strip “Gasoline Al-
ley”. Only two comic strips in the
nation boast a continual run longer
than “Gasoline Alley”, illustrated
by cartoonist Jim Scancarelli of
Charlotte.

Several

months ago,

Scancarelli introduced a new story
line featuring the escapades of
Rover, a young boy whose older
sister Gretchen is a student at
Davidson College.

In Davidson’s comic debut,
Rover marvels at the campus while
standing before Davidson’s most
recognizable landmark: Chambers
building.

Davidson attracted “Gasoline
Alley” fame by chance when
Scancarelli visited the school last
December, camera in hand. At the
time, Scancarelli intended to use
only his photos of campus build-
ings as models for “Gasoline
Alley’s” illustrations. However,

as Scancarelli explained in the
Davidson Journal this spring, “I
Started not to use [Davidson’s]
name, then thought, ‘Why not?’
It’s the real thing.”
