THE VIRGINIA GAME.

The fate football game against Vir-
ginia brought to light several facts. It
showed that Davidson has one of the
strongest, fastest, scrapplest teams she
has had in years. It shows that she has
a coach such as few other colleges are
privileged to have. It shows that Dav-
idson pep, famous in the past, must be
here in double portion this year, since it
can make a team “outplay both on of-
fensive and defensive” a much heavier
and more experienced team, for the last
three quarters. It shows, too, that Dav-
idson is hooked for a victorious season,

And so we are proud of Davidson,
that she can put out such a team. We
are grateful to the alumni who have
helped. We are proud of our coach.
We are proud of each man on the team.
Yes, and we are proud of the Scrubs,
without whose work the Varsity would
he helpless. And lastly, we are proud of
ourselves that we belong to such a col-

lege.

BE A KICKER.

“Don't be a kicker, be a booster,” is
a slogan much used in the editorial col-

umns of various publications. But we
disagree. Be a kicker, we say, and kick
hard, provided you kick forward and not
backward. If there is anything about
THe Davipsonian, or any other phase
of college life, that you don't like, or
don't approve of, kick about it, but kick
it forward. Let your criticism be con-
structive as well as destructive. Con-
demn a poor policy or plan, but have a
hetter to offer in its stead. Call the
questions for debate in the literary socie-
ties poor, if they are, but suggest some
hetter ones. Denounce the stand of the
Student Council, if you do not approve
of it. but show a wiser, more practical
course. It is only thru forward kickers
that THe Davipsonian or anything
else can grow bigger and better.

LETTER TO STUDENT BODY.

Editor of The Davidsonian:

As a loyal alumnus of Davidson 1
wish to say just a word to the Student
Body. hat score against Virginia Sat-
urday looks mighty good, and we friends
of Davidson want to see the whole Stu-
dent Body down in Charlotte next Sat-
urday backing up that team of Red and
Black warriors against A. & M. I be-
lieve Davidson has one of the best teams
she has ever had, and we can beat that
bunch next Saturday if the Student Body
gets in behind the team with some of
the old-time “pep” and spirit. The
writer is a member of the class which
furnished eight of the eleven men who
tied Virginia, beat V. P. I., Clemson and
Georgia, all on their own fields. He be-
lieves that the team this year will be just
as good, and if every student now at
Davidson had the same feeling toward
‘A. & M. that existed in the fall of 1908,
they would all be on the sidelines in
Charlotte Saturday. Give the fellows a
proper send-off on Friday night. They

will do their part, and you students

must do yours.
Best wishes for a happy and success-
ful year. “1909.”

DR. McCONNELL'S
RELEASE SOUGHT

Thru Dr. Wm. J. Martin’s untiring
efforts the release of Dr. J. W. McCon-
nell seems almost certain, Dr. Martin
took this matter up with the Secretary
of War and also with President Wil-
son. He has received a telegram from
the War Department stating that if Dr.
McConnell would put in his resigna-
tion, it would be favorably considercd.
Dr. McConnell at once wired in his
resignation. While it is not certain, it

is believed that Dr. McConnell will be

released and back on the campus within}.

a few days.

CHEER LEADERS ELECTED.

Due to the fact that E. H. Linfield
failed to return to college this fall, the
Student Body was left without a cheer
leader. At a meeting last week the fol-
lowing men were elected: W.H. Neal,
cheer leader; J. S Brown and H. K.
Aiken, assistants,

TENNIS TOURNAMENT
STARTS NEXT MONDAY

.'

The Annual Tennis ‘Tournament will
probably begin next Monday, October
gth. Every effort is being made to have
the courts in shape by that date. Plans
have not been perfected as yet. There
will probably be a change from the cus-
tom of recent years with regard to en-
trance fees.

All contestants are practicing every
day now and with the increase in inter-
est and popularity of the game here in-
dications point to the best tournament
ever held here.

SPECIAL TRAIN TO
CHARLOTTE SATURDAY

Arrangements have been completed
for running a speciad train to Charlotte
Saturday on account of the A. & M.
football game, and it is hoped the entire
student body will avail themselves of
this opportunity to see one of the best
games of the whole season at reduced
rates. The train will leave Davidson
at 1:30 p. m., and returning will leave
Charlotte 11 p.m. There will be special
round trip rate of 80 cents, and while
the regular admission to the game will
be one dollar, Davidson students will be
admitted for 50 cents, provided tickets
are purchased on the Hill.

While there is nothing mysterious about the process, it requires, among
other things, good judgment, taste, and a desire to keep ahead or above the
average. “The goodness of printing is governed by the printer’s equipment
plus his ability to use it. We have a generous supply of both and are con-
stantly adding to them.

Our line embracés all kinds and classes of work, but
we prefer to do the better kind. If you desire the
best in any class we can meet your requirements,
and guarantce to please you.
