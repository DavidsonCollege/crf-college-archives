A FAST START...

In three short days about eleven thousand people;
saw this year’s basketball team open up with two wins. |

In the first game, Davidson rolled over an obviously
outclassed Hampden-Sydney. In a game marked by a
5’6” guard, jumping center; Fred Hetzel scored 21 points
in the first half and a liberal use was made of all 11 ball
players. There wasn't much doubt as to the outcome from
Start to finish.

Monday night, however, it was a different story.
Wake Forest, a team forgotten by the reporters, took}
the floor before over 7500 people with the firm belief
that they were the best team.

Employing a scrambling 1-3-1 zone defense, the
Deacons managed to keep within reach of the ’Cats until
the last few minutes. Leading scorer was again Hetzel
with 24 points, but I think it’s safe to say that he didn’t
win the game alone.

Perhaps the performance that went most unnoticed |
was that of Don Davidson. He scored 12 points, made sev-
eral assists and stood out all night long grabbing re-

12 Swimmers Open
Year With Clemson

Today the Wildcat swimming team, under the direc-
tion of Coach Dwight Shue, opens its season with Clem-
son here at 3:00 p.m. Coach Shue will take a 12 man

bounds and loose basketballs. His outstanding job, how-
ever, came on defense. Bob Leonard, sophomore guard,
has been touted by Coach Bones McKinney as the best
back-court man he has ever coached.

The morning papers were high in their acclaim for
Leonard but noted that he could only manage to score
18 points. Perhaps the reason he could only manage 13
points. was that Davidson played him almost all night.
Leonard is good and will be a top scorer. He shoots well
and drives and jumps exceptionally. Monday night, he
scored 13 points.

All in all it was a good start.

HARROWING HOLIDAYS...

Lest the flags fly too high and since this is the last
paper before Christmas, perhaps a word is in order about
the upcoming holiday schedule.

On December 30 and 31, Davidson is host for the
Charlotte Invitational. Our first round opponent will be
Pennsylvania, a team that is rebuilding after a fine 19-6
record last year. The second round opponent will be
either Princeton or Texas. Princeton features Bill Brad-
ley, first team All American, and was last year’s Ivy
League Champion.

Texas could be one of the best teams in the coun-
try. hast year they won the Southwest Conference and
gave Cincinnati a close game in NCAA regionals. Texas rea.
will return four of the top five men, including 6’8” Mike Mark Waldon and Bud Frye;

be an all important key to the
success of next year’s squad.

the meet this Friday should be

SHORTS...

The tall red-headed referee who drew so much at-
tention Monday night was “Red” Mihalik. Mr. Mihalik
has recently been voted the outstanding basketball offi-|
cial in America by a leading magazine.

If Davidson used to be an unexciting team to watch,
‘tis true no more. When the lights dim and the cigarette; :
smoke seems to disappear and a figure comes from the
darkness of the Coliseum to be met with a thunderous
(really) applause, it’s not unexciting any longer.

It occurs to me that the process of selecting All-
Americans may be hurting. In pre-season selections, most
selections have given Fred Hetzel a wide berth. They ||
have seemingly chosen to play safe and put him on the hr
third team or honorable mention. As the season goes on, ¥
it will be interesting to note how many ball players you
would rather have on your team than Hetzel.

As ‘Cats Sweep Opening Two

BY BOB STRAUSER
Coach “Lefty” Driesell introduced his fourth Davidson basketball squad to Johnston Gym this week; the
debut did not go unnoticed (after two games Sports Illustrated ranks Davidson 16th in the nation). The opener on

BY DAVID POWELL

‘If seniority means anything,” quipped Coach Charlie
Parker when asked about the outlook for this year's
wrestling team, “‘we ought to be real tough.’ Of the eight
weight classes on the team six are filled by seniors, with
a sophomore and a junior holding down the other two

positions.

Turning serious, Coach Park-
er explained that he was count-
ing heavily on the experience of
the team. With a commendable
6-2-1 season last year, Parker

match it.”

_ The team opens its season
here tonight at 7:30 against a

“We have the best chance of
bealing them in a long time,”
explained Parker, “and that's

when he thought of the pros-

29-27.

In the second half. with the
starting five back in, Davidson
began pulling away. Coach Drie-
sell attributed the second half
success to defensive play and

the fact that we were “getting
our shots.” Don Davidson
knotted the score at 41 with 12
minutes left and the ‘Cats never
trailed after that. Playing a big
role in the second half surge,
Hetzel finished the night with
24 points and 14 rebounds.
The ‘Cats again finished with
a rebound edge, 38-27 and again
hit better than half their shots
from the floor. Of his team's
performance Driesel! said. “We
were picked to win by six or
seven and we won by 13; I don’t
see how anyone can be unhappy
with that.” He went on to say
that he would probably start his
same five against St. Josephs.
In looking to the Southern
Conference race this year, the
comment of a Carolina sports
writer—“Without Hetzel Dav-
idson looks like a. contender for
last place in the Southern Con-
ference*—-was mentioned. “Fred

‘is a tremendous. athlete." said

Driesell, “But this is hardly a
one man team.”
