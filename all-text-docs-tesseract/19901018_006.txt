Rape Awareness Vital to Davidson

To the Editors:

This letter is in response
to Sara Carlson’s article in
the September 27
Davidsonianconcerning the
phone threats she has re-
ceived.

Thecalls display an open
hatred and ignorance which
only accentuate the need for
the rape awareness program
at Davidson. Not just for the
freshman halls, but for the
entire campus.

Our social habits and the
quality of our gender rela-
tions solidify during the
college years -- they deter-
mine how we will relate or
not relate with the opposite
sex for our entire lifetime.
What sort of husband or
father will the idiot who
called Sara be if his attitude
toward women does not
change? He felt threatened
enough by her articles and
existence tocall, demonstrat-
ing a distorted vision of
power-based relationships.
He reacted to someone who
upset this vision with vio-
lence. What an ignorantly

male reaction.

The calls constitute ver-
bal assault and are punish-
able by law. But that does
notalleviate the psychologi-
cal damage that such a call
can inflict. Survivors and
counselors make very little
distinction between threat-
ened andattempted rape. The
effects are just as devastat-
ing and enduring. They in-
troduce women to the reality
of living in fear.

Too many women
understand this fear per-
fectly. Too many men are
ignorant of its existence and
are ignorant of how much
they contribute to its daily
perpetuation.

The Davidson Rape
Awareness Commitice spent
the entire last year putting
this program together. Such
work takes determination,
courage and compassion .It
is emotionally exhausting. I
think the fact that Sara has
become a victim of the very
people whom she was hop-
ing to educate is tragic.

It does not speak well
for the school or it’s stu-

dents. Quite frankly, it dis-
gusts me.

Tapplaud Sara’s strength
and willingness to continue
working with the commit-
tee. I think it is unfortunate
that such educational work
is necessary, but as Kather-
ine Strickland pointed out in
her article in the same issue,
one in seven women are
raped or sexually abused
during their four years of
college.

The saddest statistic is
that these women will gradu-
ate intoa world where one in

‘four women are raped or,

abused during their lifetime.
Your sister, your mother, or
your wife, Mr. Caller, I pray
to God, will not be one of
them. But is that what it
would take to wake you up
to reality?

Perhaps then you would
understand living in fear, a
fear to which you have con-
tributed, and which has re-
duced us all.

Sincerely yours,

Tradition Important at Alabama

Dear Mr. David Scott:

Iam writing concerning
your article entitled “Wel-
come to the Small Time”
which appeared in the Sep-
tember 27 issue of The
Davidsonian.

Although I found your
article interesting, and for
the most part well written,
you should scriously con-
sider checking outsome facts
before you print more igno-
rant misinformation.

I am from Huntsville,
Alabama and am a die hard
Crimson Tide fan, therefore
I feelitis my duty to defend
the state that you so kindly
referred to as a “ home for

wayward rednecks possess-
ing between us perhaps the
brains ofa flattened pigskin”.

Your first ignorant mis-
take was to imply that no
one liked Billy Curry. True,
he was not of Bear Bryant’s
“family”, but tradition does
mean a great deal to Crim-
son Tide fans.

But since you are from
Georgia, and possibly a Tech
fan, you would not know a
thing about tradition.

Your second and most
glaring mistake was to state
that Curry was “canned”. In
this instance you are just
wrong.

Alabama offered an ex-
tension to his contract, but

he refused it. Contrary to
your uninformed statement,
he left for Kentucky of his
own free will. Also, Ala-
bama did not go 10-3 last
year, but rather 10-2. Get it
straight!

The fact that Alabamais
0-3 troubles me, but it does
not disturb me as much as
someone making degrading
generalizations abouta state
that already gets a bad rap.

So please, research your
facts before printing any
more witless articles.

Sincerely,
BRANNON J. BUCK '94

Eliminate All Letter Grades

By Wolfgang Christian
and Dan Boye

The recent faculty vote
to introduce minus grades at
Davidson College points out
a fundamental limitation
with letter grades; letter
grades are non-numerical in
nature and therefore diffi-
cult to subdivide or average.
A change to the direct as-
signment of numerical GPA
points would overcome this
deficiency and provide the
added flexibility withoutad-
ditional changes in the cur-
rent academic regulations.

We support the French
Department’ s original pro-
posal to expand the current
grading system to include
minus grades. We too have
noticed a wide range of stu-
dent achievement lumped
into a single grade.. ~~

Unfortunately, the cur-
rent assignment of A = 4.0,
B+=3.5, B=3.0, etc., divides
the GPA scale into equally
spaced symmetrical grading
system or in the elimination
of the current “plus” grade
to be replaced by a “new

place” grade equal to 3.7 or
2.7 GPAS.

Clearly, what is needed
are grades corresponding to
GPAs with quartef point
increments without chang-
ing the current assignable

GPA points. This is impos- -

sible using letter grades

ea

The recent faculty
vote to introduce
minus grades at
Davidson College
points out a funda-
mental limitation
with letter grades.

without such linguistic con-
tortions as A-- or C+/B-. A
direct assignment of grade
points will solve this prob-
lem.

In order to minimize
disruption to academic stan-
dards, academic regulations,
and record keeping, the
conversion toaGPA system
should be implemented in a

straightforward way with the
following faculty resolu-
tions:

(1) All grades will be
assigned on GPA scaleof ()
to 4 with the following as-
signment to the previous
letter grade system:

4.0=A= Excellent

3.0 = B= Very Good

2.0 = C = Good

1.0=D= Poor

0.0=E = Fail

(2) Faculty may assign
any GPA grade to the near-
est quarter point. .

(3) Faculty may restrict
their grading to the nearest
half or full GPA point pro-
vided they list their grading
scheme in the course sylla-
bus and announce it during
the first week of class. Fac-
ulty may continue to-send
grades to the registrar using
the current. grading system
and the registrar would con-
vert them to the GPA sys-
tem.

The Great Towing
Controversy Must Continue

Davidson is riled up.
People stop other people and
ascertain opinions. Students
laugh and discuss and tell
personal stories to empha-
size their points. The ad-
ministration responds. with
phone calls and letters.

I’m not referring to the

possible war in the Middle
East, Harvey Gantt, abortion,
AIDS, David Souter (re-
member him?), the proposed
trash incinerator, or even
recycling. I’m talking tow-
ing. Eemaaaties ate:

Finally there is an issue
within grasp of our experi-
ence and pocketbook. We

understand being late for
class and rushing out to find
our (illegally parked) car
towed to the never-never
land of Satellite Hell. We
can visualize our checking
accounts dwindling directly
into the fat recesses of the
Mystery Profit Black Hole.
We feelthisone. And we’ve
come out with a vengeance.

Our apathetic hiberna-
tion is finished. We will no
longer sit numbly at the side
of Issue Avenue, snoring

while millions of Causes go _

marching east with reaction-
ary lobbyists following. We
will stretch, shake our prone

bodies, and crawl up the
bootstraps of respectable
Youthful Idealism.’ Maybe
we’ ll even register to vote!

us “The Lost Generation.”
