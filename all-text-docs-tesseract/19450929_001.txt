New Fall Court

McAlister Chosen Judge Of
Court Of Control

Bill Rogers, the new President of
the Student Body has selected John
McAlister to be the Judge of the
Court of Control.

McAlister is from Greensboro, N.
C. He entered Davidson in the Fall
of 1941. During his freshman year
he was on the track team and
a member of the Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon social fraternity. He left in the
Spring of ’43 and joined the U. S.
Army Air Corps becoming a fighter

The Court of Control is an estab-
lished feature on the Davidson cam-
pus, and its primary purpose being
to enforce the freshmen regulations,
and to deal out justice tothose guilty
of violating the rules. It is to be re-
membered that the Court is an
official organization: of the college
backed by the administration and
the student council and its decrees
are to be regarded as law. *

The assignment of patrolling the
college grounds, and various other
similiar punishments constitute the
penalities.

Among the requirements which all
freshmen must observe are:

1, Wear freshmen
times.

2.« Keep off the grass.

3. Carry laundry when requested
to do so by upper-classmen.
