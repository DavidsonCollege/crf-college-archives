Toss in a second half against Duke which saw the Cats
outdo the Devils themselves 44-41 but fail by 90-68 to close a first
semester chasm. And there’s the first half Citadel score when
we “rolled’’ to a 34-23 halftime lead and then had to all but
sit on our basket the final few minutes to grab a panting 55-52
win.

This isn’t a chiding of our boys who run ‘with hoop horses.
But it is interesting, to say the least, to look at, and it gives rise
to some question. Why the all- the-way-one-half stuff and no
all-the-way-all-the-way stuff? You don’t know. You expect to
read it here. I don’t know so I ask Boyd Baird. He doesn’t know
and can tell you that referee Arnold Heft doesn’t either.

‘Boy,’ boys Boyd, ‘‘I never saw anything like our first half
ugainst Duke, and believe me I never want to see anything like
it again! We were awful! Terrible! But look at the second half.
Played decent ball, outscored them, looked good. After the
game I asked Heft if he ever saw a team look as sloppy the
first half. He nicely pointed out how much better we looked the
second half. But he couldn’t tell me why. ‘Boyd,’ he said to me,
‘If you knew why you’d be basketball's coach of the year.’

Baird isn’t buying tickets to New York to attend any coach
of the year banquet, but he has his ideas. ‘‘You take our weave.
‘I've told the guys and told them—when they’re weaving out
front, HAND the ball to each other. Naw, they throw it, and
when they do the opponents steps right between them and—Zip,
he’s down the court and in for a lay-up.

“Our passing just isn’t what it should be, but our defense
has hurt us more than anything. Heck, we’re averaging about
60 points a game (Through Duke game Monday night David-
son averaged 60.6, opponents 74.4—Ed.) but we’re not holding
the other team down. And you win games by scoring more points
than the other team, not just by coming close.”

Coach Baird's last statement is hardly deniable, and act-
ing upon its truth we may say the Cats should win a few in
February. According to the prognosticators a home team has
a three point advantage to start with, and swith eight home
contests in February business should look up. Last night’s Mary-
land battle, a Monday tiff with South Carolina, and a Monday-
week encounter with Duke are the -stiffest tests. Others with
Citadel (Saturday) Furman, Clemson, Washington and Lee, and
‘MeCrary’s remain at home. VMI and W & L are the final road
foes.

Prior to the Maryland game ‘we had a 1-9 conference rec-
ord. By winning nine of the remaining ten we could split 10-10
with a chance at the tournament. Remote possibility? Yes, but
Baird doesn’t quit til he’s counted out, and he is noted for giant
killing on his home floor. Whether T. C. will be in on the last
half stretch is questionable. Says Baird, ‘‘It’s up to him.”’ The
Kaintuck cutup has been hampered all winter with a bad knee,
favoring it to the extent of injury to his good one. Reserves
(namely Joe Dudley, Jim Smith) will have to swork into the
combination with the regulars if the Cats are to generate a pay-
off punch.

Sometimes you think maybe Baird is right ‘‘Maybe we just
haven't got: the manpower.” But before you’re convinced, you
always find yourself looking at a halftime score and wondering
all over again.

other ideas. They have recently
been a winning team and have un-
doubtedly improved since their
first game with Davidson. If the
Cats are to win this one, they
know they will have to play hard
all the way, since they blew a
twenty point lead in the last game
to win by only three points. Such
a strong finish could mean the
difference for either team Satur-
day night in the Armory.

The Wildcats look to be in very
good shape for the game, but per-
haps two hard games with Duke
and Maryland in five days could
hurt chances for a win. Neverthe-
less, the old steadies Dutch Henge-
veld, Tom Haller, Bill Brooks, Al
Fitzgerald, Don Lazenby, and Mac
McLean, Bob Turk and Bill Proc-
tor will be’ ready to go for the
Cats. Also look for three up and
coming sophs in Bob Graham, Joe
Dudley, and Jim Smith to make a
good showing Saturday. All three
did particularly well against Duke
Monday night, and all three seem
to have found their scoring ways
just recently. Bill Brooks will be
out to’ keep his place among the
conference scorers; he also ranks
sixth in the nation in foul shooting
percentage. Certainly Davidson will
have to show a better defense
against the Citadel than they did
against Duke Monday night when
the Blue Devils hit the nets for
ninety points.

The Citadel boasts two high
scorers in forward Shumanski and
guard Freidlund. Shumanski is a

The Cats will be out to make it two in a row over the Citadel,

has been out of action recently, is
still one of Bulldog’s high scorers.
Only 5’ 10”, this guard is a very
good set shot and could give the
Davidson defense a hard night if
it were thrown up against him and
his teammates.

Although both teams score con-
sistently high, Davidson probably
has a slight edge in that depart-
ment. However, look for the Cita-

Profiting From Loss To Carolina,

Tanks Move Against VPI Tomorrow

By CHARLIE HASSELL
The Wildcat swimming team, strange as it may seem, profit-
ed a great deal from its loss to the University of North Carolina
last Saturday. ‘‘You can’t be good until you play the best,”
was Coach Dick Redding’s explanation for this. The Tar Heels,
who are the presesft conference champs and will doubtless re-

pound weight class. Craven also
sports a record not to go unnoticed:
he won his match against N. C.
State, and had a draw with Howie
Davis, unbeaten conference champ
from Washington and Lee, in
Johnston gymnasium early last De-
cember.

Bob Gay, who has won his only
two matches this year by pins,
will undoubtedly make a good
match out of the 167-pound divi-
sion.

ber of valuable pointers; since that
meet the Davidson swimmers are
working much harder.

This Saturday, the tank team
goes to Blacksburg to oppose V.
P.J., but their biggest hope is to
gain further experience. Captain
Bill Ray, from Silver Springs,
Florida, may win the fifty yard
dash. Against South Carolina he
swam the length in 24.8, and
against U.N.C. he turned in the
winning time of 24.4. Although the
team is fairly good in the sprints,
they need another good sprinter.
Ray, Hugh Evans, Ken Taylor, and
Dan Heizer (all sprinters) make
up the 400 yard free styles relay;
and three of these four will swim
the 300 yard medley relay.

The team has a good group of
distance men. Francis Pepper and
Paul Cole are the 440 yard men.
Cole has been consistently bring-
ing his time down. Hugh Evans,
who was out of the Carolina meet
because of a boil, will be against
the VPI 220-man. In the 200 yard
breaststroke will be Ray Cunning-
ham and George Cornelson, and
Hampton Mauze and Gene Regen
will swim the 150 yard backstroke.

Gene Regen is the sole entry in
the diving class. Regen, however,

is doing better than was at first
expected. The loss of Ed West from
the diving ranks . has hampered
the team.

Coach Redding has the nucleus
of a good freshman team, but needs
more men. Ben Gary, Ed Stuart,
Bob Mims, and Bob Buck (who
has since left) managed to beat
South Carolina. But if future teams
are to bring home victories, more
rhen must try out for this year’s
freshman squad. ;

V.P.I. received third in the con-
ference meet last year, and its pow-
er has not diminished to a great de-
gree, if any. They beat State, who,
by comparative standings, is more
powerful than Davidson. Although
the Cat's only win this year has
been from South Carolina, they
hope to add at least three more
to the list. But, as Redding states,
“VPI. will probably not be one
of them.”

Wildcat of Week

By DICK ROPER

The boy was doing pretty weil
for himself. He had just beaten
North Carolina—boasting some of
the best swimmers in the nation—
in the fifty yard dash. As captain
of Davidson's first swimming team,
he was setting a pretty good exam-
ple for his teammates with a fine
time of 24.4 for that event.

The long, lithe body churning up
all the spray belonged to one Bill
“Bluc” Ray, 22-year-old native of
Ocala, Florida. Although this is
his first season in competitive col-
legiate swimming, Bill was-in the
pool in the new gymnasium almost
every chance he had last year,

Squash Top Course
On Winter PE Menu

Squash, the tenderpaim’s answer
to handball, has debuted and is
fast gajning popularity in the win-
ter physical education program.

Offered for the first time as a
course in the first nine weeks of
the second semester, the. game
which raises a racket on the .hand-
ball courts is all but driving its
predecessor out of business.

But handball still prevails inter-
fraternity action as well as physi-
cal ed classes. It is listed with
squash, swimming, gymnastics,
wrestling, and badmitton on the
PE card for the semester's opening
nine weeks.

And that test is...

dives, and spending long, grueling |

hours on endurance work under:
the supervision of Coach Dick Red-
ding. (It might be added that Red-
ding doesn’t have to use his whip
on Ray, either—" Blue" is one of the
most conscientious workers the tank
coach has ever had under his tute-
lage.) And, had Davidson had a
swimming pool when Bill was a
freshman, he probably would have
made the team that very year. But,
since he is a senior, Ray seems to
be out to make up for every bit
of the time he has lost.
Undefeated in the 50-yard dash
going into today’s meet with VPI
Bill also swims the 100-yard free-
style and the 400-yard relay. In the
South Carolina mect a few weeks
ago, he was one of the main rea-

sons the Cats won that meet. He],

first won the fifty; then, only a
few minutes later, he was first in

on the 100; and finally, he swam |’

the last lap of the 400-yard relay
to put. his team in first place in that
event also.

-Bill is human. He enjoys praise
as much as anybody else. But he
is modest to the point of tears. So
quiet and soft-spoken is this boy,
he wouldn't even be noticed around
the campus if it weren't for his tow-
ering six-foot -~—- three-inch plus
frame. Yet there is nothing about
Bill that would suggest the gang-
ling carriage of the oversize basket-
ball player: “Blue” is all grace and
rhythm as he glides up and down
the pool, whether it be in a sprint

The class clown went out on a limb and tried to prove
cigarette mildness by the quick-trick method! He tried the fast inhale, fast
exhale test—a whiff, a sniff—and they still left him up in the air!
But then he got his feet on the ground. He learned that there is

a reliable way to discover how mild a cigarette can be!

The sensible test .. . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test
which simply asks you to try Camels as a steady smoke—on a
pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap
judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels—
and only Camels—for 30 days in your “T-Zone” (T for Throat,
T for Taste), we believe you'll know why ...

More People Smoke Camels
than any other cigarette!

Davidson may have better swim-
mers on its teams in the future.
But it will probably be a long time
before it can boast a better all-
round performer or a more willing
worker than Bill Ray.

Winter's Grid Drills

ceptions for basketball, wrest-
ling, etc., Little will have his
full squad at work.
