A Time For Change

This year marks what we strongly
believe to be a new dawn in the life of
Davidson as the primary molder in the
total growth-intellectual, social, and
moral- of the people who have chosen
to spend four years of their lives here.

Certainly there is much to be en-
couraged about. For the first time,
there are enough coeds so that they can
begin to assert a positive influence on
the males here. In the area of financing
- which had many expressing grave
concern last year - there appears to be
a break as the library fund drive is
near completion, and one for new dor-
mitories in sight. Needed changes also
seem imminent in the whole academic
fabric of the college. And so on.

However the list is not endless.

There are things here at Davidson
that have not been improved which
desperately need renovation. It is
these negative aspects of Davidson on
which we will focus much of our at-
tention this year, so as to make the
powers that be respond to these
problems. For Davidson has the chan-
ce to become the finest institution of
higher learning in the South, if only it
will respond to the challenges of
students and others.

In the first place, Davidson must
move its Union out of the shabby
building in which it now exists. And the
time to make plans is now, not several
years in the future.

Students must also be given an im-
portant role in the new governance
system, which is something that does

not appear likely to us. The possibility
that students will be given a significant
part in making decisions directly af-
fecting their welfare now seems slim
at best as the Faculty remains strongly
opposed to student participation in
governance. Something must be done
before it is too late.

The whole area of the Christian Com-
mitment of the college must undergo a
face-lift, so as to make it more har-
monious with the concepts that stu-
dents now have regarding religion.

And as has been reiterated so many
times before, the entire Athletic
Program must be reevaluated.

However, what we feel to be the most
crucial transformation needed is not a
physical change but a silent change - a
revolution of the mind - to raise the
consciousness of everyone here -
students, faculty, trustees, and town-
speople alike- to the point where people
can deal with others as genuine human

beings.

We would like to be able to forsee a
time when this college could truly exist
as a community (a word which must
have been bandied around since the
time that Davidson came into existen-
ce.) To accomplish this,, we cannot
look to any one great Messiah but in-
stead to everyone here. It is probably
the ultimate challenge confronting us.

So to the readers this year, we warn
you now that we do not plan to abide
by the status quo, but to challenge. And
in this struggle we are not out to make
enemies, but to convert. So be
forewarned.

A Battle Won

Through the diligent efforts of many
people throughout this country,
Americans as a collective whole have
begun to realize that ecological con-
cerns must be weighed in balance
with technological progress before
decisions affecting both the earth and
its inhabitants can be made.

We applaud the courage and
foresight of those people in the David-
son community who have blocked, at
least temporarily, the construction of
the proposed Marine World on Lake
Norman.

We concur with their beliefs that
such a project would have caused far

more damage to the social structure
and environmental make-up of the
community than could ever have
been justified by the financial and
recreational benefits of such a plan.

Hopefully the town will now proceed
with the continued maintenance and
improvement of its resources so as to
insure a clean, prosperous heritage for
its inhabitants.

We feel that the lesson that can be
learned from this struggle is that if
people will only organize they can still
successfully protect their rights
against the vested interests of money
and privilege. And this is some hope for
the future.

The Art of Raising Money

Over the past three years, the
Development staff, headed by Vice-
President for Finance and Develop-
ment C. David Cornell, has done an
outstanding job in increasing the
amount of money that the college
received from outside sources.

Without such a performance David-
son could have found itself in an ex-
tremely tenuous financial position at
the present time. As it now stands we
are doing reasonably well at a time
when many other colleges are flounder-
wn this regard, we would like to

especially cite Director of Alumni Af-
fairs Howard Arbuckle for his work
with the Annual Giving Program.

Through his efficient coordination of
this program the amount of money
Davidson has received from its alumni
and parents has risen steadily over the
past three years to the point where in
fiscal year 1973, the college received
$294,568, an increase of $105,810 over
1971.

So to Arbuckle, all his assistants, all
the class chairmen, and everyone else
in Development we extend our
congratulations, and hope that their
success continues.

The start of a new year
always brings optimism. And
there is much to be optimistic
about. There remain aspects of
Davidson, however. that deser-
ve nothing short of abject

imism. This week I shall
try to dwell on the optimistic
side, as much as possible, even
though everyone to whom |
have spoken has entreated me
to scathe.

I have observed the campus
since returning. Davidson has a
new look. It is commonly called
the clean and innocent spirit of
the Freshman.

Two factors aid the life of this
spirit , also known as the ghost-
in-the-college. Mrs. Nicholls
showed great intelligence in
separating the freshman men’s
dormitories. This has reduced
the amount of noise and ob-
scenity winging through the air.

The great distance between
Cannon and Richardson Dor-
mitories has also kept the
amount of water in the at-
mosphere at an all-time low.
Not that I am against a little,
good, healthy obscenity or a
well-planned water attack, but
an extremely cold shower and

you who aren't liberated.)
Many years ago, Alonzo Cohen,
noted Paraguayan
philosopher on this
subject. Said the Sage: ‘‘A man
may be the king of his castle,
but it takes a woman to be
Queen-for-a-Day.”

This may sound like nonsense
to the untrained ear, but to
those of us who have spent
years studying Professor
Cohen, there is great hidden
meaning.

Ease, something that this
campus has needed for many
years, has been present
everywhere since we've retur-
ned. President Spencer is a fine
example of the calm that has hit
Davidson. He was at ease with
his new faculty members at

New Year Heralds
Rekindled Optimism

their reception and with sty.
dents all week.

This phenomenon is not so un-
predictable since he spent years
at Mary Baldwin. But it's
something new on our campus.

This may not be the onl,
reason for his loosened coun.
tenance, but it can't help being
a factor. He may feel, as man,
of us do, that this is going to be a
very good year. Not that there
won't be plenty to complain
about and battle over, but that's
part of the fun of being here.

The country club aspects of
Davidson haven't changed
much - we still need a golf
course and sauna before we’!
be THE club.

The College Union (Tem-
porary) with the addition of
Duff Bruce is planning bigger
and better excuses for why
programs fail. They're even
planning some programs that
might get some student support
including a TV room in the
Lower Level (also known as the
basement ) where free beer will
be served.

The Union Board (Per-
manent) got an early start on
beoking concerts and social
events. With a little student sup-

The faculty has beenenhanced
with the addition of professors
of divergent teaching methods
and beliefs. Not to mention dif-
ferent sexes, an innovation
whose time came 10 years ago
most places. A friend of mine
tried to convince me that
of different beliefs and styles
were brought on pur-
pose. This he the zoo ap-
proach to staffing a college.
Personally, I believe it was
‘ . 7” thod i
call the Tower-of Babel ap-
proach.

The Center for Honors Studies
is starting its first year under
the guidance of Massah
Professor Dean MacCormac. It

can't but succeed . con-
sidering his ability and en-
thusiasm.

I warned you that this week |

was going to be optimistic. It's
an optimistic time of year. The
purpose of this column in the
future will be to analyse
problems at Davidson and ex-
plore possible solutions. Not
that I have any solutions but if |
can bring the attention of this
country club to something other
than tennis and handball I will
feel successful.
