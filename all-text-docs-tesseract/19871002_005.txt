“On a Mission from God”: The Blues Brothers

By TIM JACKS

Action! Laughter! Music!
Drama! Sideburns! Hand me that
black hat and give those black
shades! “The Blues Brothers”
plays tonight in the 900 Room at
8:30.

This classic musical-comedy
starring Dan Aykroyd and John
Belushi is just the movie to get the
weekend rockin’ and rollin’. John
Landis directed this epic tale of
the infamous Jake and Elwood
Blues. The action starts when Jake
(Belushi) gets out of oh) It

‘The torch passet.

turns out he stole some money to
cover the band’s last room service
bill. Jake and Elwood (Aykroyd)
immediately go to see their friend,
The Penguin, a nun who needs
$5,000 to cover taxes on her chil-
dren’s home.

Of course, our honorable
heroes offer their services to raise
the money. The only problem is, it
has to be done legally. But in a
flash of blazing light from above
during the Triple Rock Baptist
Church Sunday morning service,
Jake finds the answer: the brothers

will get the band back together
and earn the money. So Jake and
Elwood start on their holy quest to
find all of their old R&B band
members. (The infamous line ap-
peareth: “we're on a mission from
God.”) Despite many trials and
tribulations, including the mys-
tery woman, the Ilinois Nazis,
the Good Ol’ Boys and the
Chicago Police, all of whom want
to kill the _Blues Brothers (or at
least hurt them a lot), they succeed,
in re-forming their band. They’ ve"
even gotten the gig to raise the
money. But will they make it to

the show on time? Check it out
and see, for the low, low price of
99 cents.

This. is a star-filled movie
that’s really worth seeing, if only
for the outstanding performances
by James Brown, Aretha
Franklin, Ray Charles and Cab
Calloway as well as the Blues
Brothers. But wait, there’s more!
You’ll also see Carrie Fisher,
John Candy, and Twiggy. And for
five points each, see if you can.
find John Landis, Steven Spiel-
berg, Frank Oz, Chaka Khan, and

Pee Wee Herman in their cameo
roles! “The Blues Brothers” is
rated R for language (sorry, no
nudity) and lasts a little over 2
hours. Even if you’ve seen it be-
fore, come on, you have to see the
shopping mall get trashed by the
Bluesmobile again. Come in time
to the Looney Toons _ be-
forehand ... and remember to
bring your L D.

RLP. Booze Brothers, Hello, MacLads

By GLENN FOGLE
Every so often major tragedies
strike that leave a long lasting so-

“Cial impact and instill sadness and —

frustration in the hearts of the
world. Such losses, though griev-
ous, remind us of the true frailty of
the human existence, and yet
‘serve to underscore the strength of
the human spirit. Such a tragedy

has befallen the Davidson com--

munity.

It is with deep sorrow and re-
gret that we announce the unfortu-
nate and untimely. deaths of two of

the college community’s most be--

loved members, the Booze
Brothers. .

On the afternoon of Wednes-
day, September 23, 1987, the re-
cently born-again Booze Brothers
were en route with several of their
newly-found KA friends to a dual
lecture in the 900 room entitled
“Christianity and the art of RV
Maintenance” and “Guilt Without
Sex — Sex and the sing Sixth
Grader” when they spied an el-

Spoof 0’ the. Week

derly woman struggling across
Main Street with the grocery bags
she was carrying home from the

“soon-to-be-defunct. Food Lion.

Racing across the street to help the
old bag- (whooops!) the old
woman with her bags, they were
blinded by the immensely bright
glare of the sun. reflected off fel-
low pedestrian Dean Terry’s
head.

In the midst of their confu-
sion, they were struck down by a
carload of Queenies speeding to
elude four carloads of horny Hod-
dies (or was it Captain Pikedog
and his army of Weenies pursuing
the Queenies? Actually, we heard
it was the whole damn SPE frater-
nity looking for some women to
come to their house, but maybe it
was just a couple of Phi Delts.)

In any event, the car got away

and the tragic damage had been

done. In a sudden flash of quick-
thinking, Terry rushed the limp,
mutilated figures of the Booze
Brothers to ‘“Haven’t Got a

Prayer” Infirmary, he alas, the
Booze Brothers were dead. God
had called them back home. ___

The Booze Brothers served
this school in the most effective
way they knew — through the
media. Never ones to succumb to
the temptation of. sensationalism
or potentially yellow journalism
to get attention, the Booze
Brothers offered us all an (only
slightly) exaggerated, satiric, and

moreover tongue-in-cheek look at

ourselves.

But even by the same token,
the Booze Brothers hoped that
their readers. would be compelled
to search deep within their souls,
to explore their own true feelings
and further the distinction be-
tween themselves and the rest of
the very special individuals that
constitute this school, this com-
munity, this great nation, this
world, this solar system and all
other fragments of solid waste

floating srourd in the great vac-
uum of space.

On _ behalf of the families of
the Booze Brothers, many thanks
for the cards, letters, kitchen
appliances and Chinese domestic
discipline implements. A memo-
rial service will be held at Queens
College on Sadie Hawkins Day
(donations will be accepted.) —
The MacLads

The MaclLads have been asked
to take the place of the place of the
passed away again Booze
Brothers. We did manage to re-
cover a bloodstained fragment of
the interview with the Pope John
Paul II from the mangled body of
one of the Booze Brothers . . .

B.B.: Well, Pontiff, what
exactly do you think of the Ses-
quicentennial Edition of Quips &
Cranks?

His Holiness: [flipping
through said volume] frankly, on
behalf of the Roman Catholic
Church, [turning various shades
of red} I’m embarrassed. (The

next few lines are illegible be-
cause of bloodstains.)

Question of the Week:

“Should this column be taken
seriously?”

A: No.

‘B: Never.

C: Nope.

D: Only by “reactionary
xenophobic enclaves of superfi-
cial conformist little snobs.”
(from “Life in Hell.” Check your
back issues.)

Lecture Time: Honor Code violations are no spoof

By BILL SCOUTEN

“Hey, Jim, have. you seen my
knapsack?”

“No, what’s up?”

“Well, I thought I left it in one
of the carrels down in the base-
ment of the library. You know, my
carrel. I just don’t understand

. I’m positive I left it there
lastnight.”

“Maybe you left it in another
carrel. Let’s check. There aren’t
that many carrels in the basement.
C’mon, let’s go.”

-- “I thought that it would be safe
overnight. I asked around, and
someone said that they had seen it
this morning, but when I was
about to go to class at 10:00, it was
gone. I’ve got to find it. It’s just

_too important to lose. . . it’s got
all my supplies in it!”

Usually the carrel would be ar-
ranged with text books and library
books stacked on the top shelf, ~
supplies stored next to the books.
But today the scene is different.
The carrel is as always, in its
place, but the articles adorning its

surfaces are rearranged or mis-

sing.

First you think, “Am I at my
carrel?” Yes, you are; the library
books and remaining textbooks
are yours. But, where is the day
pack you left on the carrel? Where
are the pens and pencils? What's
the deal?

Alarmed and riled, the next
step in your search centers around
the other hundreds of carrels in the
library. Checking each one per-
sonally, you remember a prank
that a friend once pulled in high

school. You know the one -of—

which I speak; your best friend,
the one with whom you shared
your darkest secrets (and your
locker combination), arranged for
your locker to be emptied com-

pletely of its contents. The morn-_

ing after the deed — panic, utter
hysteria, as you’re left with a pen-
cil and a locker full of popcorn.

The prank was successful. This is
“the real thing, a well-planned

spoof.
However, this. is something
different. Upon speaking to

There are no leads. No one has
pulled a prank. The library has no
knowledge of missing books and
supplies — at least none were
found. You are now distraught,
highly enraged, and worried. This
is critical. What can you do?

Three days later, on one of
those daily library reconnaissance
missions for missing parapher-
nalia, the day pack is disco-
vered .. . open, in a carrel far
away from the rest in an isolated
corner of the library. The contents
-are strewn on the work-space of
the table top. A calculator is gone,
a pen is missing, an “ideal” is
shattered.

An “ideal” is shattered in your
mind, the ideal that may have in-

Davidson as a college. This hap-
pening, the disappearance of a day

pack full of personal belongings .

or the disappearance of a bike,
seemingly a prank, is far from
spoof material. In fact, this is a
serious matter, to be dealt with
immediately.

Stealing, euphemistically

known as “borrowing indefi-
nitely,” is not a spoof, nor should
it be considered by anyone to be
one. In such a community as_
Davidson, stealing should not be
tolerated. “Stealing” does not
apply just to school supplies,
though. It applies to anything that
does not belong specifically to
you. (Yes, that includes bikes!
Surprised?!&%z,$!) Tampering
with others’ possessions is not
only an incrimination of oneself

but also infringes on the rights of
“other students...

The honor system was desig-
ned by the students and is for the
students, existing to promote a
sense of trust and respect in the

_fluenced you in your choice of_college community. Indeed,

many students are hard at work
trying to keep the honor code trad-
ition working, trying to keep the
prospective and current students’
perception of Davidson college’s
honor system alive. This is the
Davidson I visited as a sophomore
in high school; the Davidson
where a coat and a Stack of books,

perhaps a day pack, could be left
overnight in the Commons and re-
main untouched.

No, the honor of Davidson is
not.a system to be worked around,
but a personal commitment to the
community. This is the Davidson
that we, the students, must propa-
gate. The honor of this establish-
ment rests not on the administra-
tion, but on us. The key to the
honor system, then, is considera-
tion for other people.

Therefore, instead of thinking ©
“honor code, schmonor code!” to
ourselves, why don’t we all exer-

-cise our responsibility? It’s a
given that Davidson will never be
perfect, but there is a sense of
community in Davidson, a diverse
student body living together in the
virtues of honesty, diligence, and
love. Let’s support the tradition of
excellence’ in educa-—
tion . . . don’t make a spoof out
of our ideal. It means, and has
‘meant, something special to so
many ...won’t you believe
also?

friends, all tributaries turn updry.
