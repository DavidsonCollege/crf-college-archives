JUST WASTING TIME

By Brooke BAGWELL
Staff Writer

As part of a four part series
dealing with stress, psychologist
and Director of the Student Health

the issue of time management and
procrastination to a small group
on Monday night.

Dr. Staton discussed symp-
toms of poor time management
and suggested methods for “‘mak-
ing time.”

Staton described manners in
which people approach the orga-
nization of time. He noted that
the issue is a matter of style, “get-
ting things done in a way that
works (for the individual).”

He accordingly outlined three
different types of people, which
he likened to animals, in pursuit
of the most efficient time usage.
Through audience participation,
Staton called on attendants to iden-
tify themselves with a particular
animal and discover the charac-

ality type.
Dr. Staton characterized poor

whelming state of rushing, con-
stantly missed deadlines, and in-
sufficient time for relaxation and
relationships.

Procrastination, Dr. Staton
said, was a lack of discipline and
self motivation. He related that
procrastination results from the

anxiety of failure, which furthers

unproductivity.

To combat poor time man-
agement and prevent procrasti-
nation, Staten suggested “rules
for making time: Learning to say
no, prioritizing, and setting aside
time for rest.”

Harry Wu to speak tonight

By MatTTHEw EIrICcH

Chinese political dissident and
human rights activist Harry Wu
will speak tonight at 7:30 PM in
Love‘Auditorium.. =~

Wu is described as a crusader
for human rights in China. He
spent nearly two decades in prison
for his political beliefs. In 1957 he
was labelled a “rightist” after an-
’ swering Chairman Mao’s call for
public debate druing the Hundred
Flowers campaign.

He was charged for the crime
of questioning the Soviet invasion
of Hungary.

Wu was released from prison

in 1979. He moved to the United
States in 1985. Soon thereafter he
began a campaign to publicize the
wretched conditions of China’s

labor reform system. In 1991 he-

returned to China, secretly filming
prison conditions and unscrupu-
lous business practices involving
prison labor.

Wu has published two books,
Laogai: The Chinese Gulag and
him memior, Bitter Winds.

Last summer, Wu returned to
China surreptitiously with the in-
tention of researching human rights
violations. His detention by Chi-
nese authorities became an inter-
national cause celebre.

Davidson community.

The Crop Lunch on Thursday
brought to the table the planet-
wide problem of hunger, a major
focus of Reach Out during the regu-
lar course of the year. On Thurs-
day afternoon the Parks and Rec-
reation group played kickball and
other games on the Chamber’s
Lawn. ~

Other events that took place
this week were trips to the Flo-
rence Crittendon Center and the
Uptown Men’s Shelter in Char-
lotte. On Thursday there was a
community - dessert in the
Chamber’s Gallery and on
Wednesday Ralph de Costa Nunez,
president of Homes for the Home-
less, spoke on homelessness and
other pertinent issues.

According to senior Smita
Donthamsetty, president of Reach

Out, there was not enough public-
ity. “The week needed to be played
up more, though not to the point of
being sensationalized like a con-
cert,” she says. “We just wanted
people to know what was out
there.”

Donthamsetty thought that the
information tables were the most
effective aspect of the week, edu-
cating the student body on what
service Opportunities were avail-
able.

She also thought that the
Nunez lecture was “well responded
to”, but that despite the success of
these two activities, there was no
definitive cornerstone activity for
the week.

Donthamsetty says that Reach
Out, in general, is, “working to-
wards being a more cohesive body
to make it easier for people to get
irivolved in service.” With this
goal in mind, Into The Streets Week
was certainly a step in the right
direction for the Davidson service
program, she says, but there is al-
ways more to be done.

Soccer history at

Davidson

By Jason McMUuLLAN
Staff Writer

With both the men’s and
women’s teams taking the South-
ern Conference titles, soccer at
Davidson is hotter than ever.

Soccer first came to Davidson
in 1934, when it was played as an
intramural sport. The games, and
the sport itself, were given little
publicity at the time. It was greatly
overshadowed by nearly all other
sports including intramurals.

However, as the short inaugu-
ral tournament progressed, the
sport gained popularity. “In its
first season on the campus, soccer
has gained a good foothold here,
and future seasons should be even
more successful” reported a 1934
Davidsonian article.

It gained such a foothold in
fact, that the next year welcomed
soccer as-a varsity sport. In that
1935 season, the Wildcats faced
Clemson, Furman, and Duke, as
well as teams from High Point and
Charlotte. With a 3-3 tie against
High Point, the previous year’s
state champions, the team was an
instant success, The eight game
season ended with a 3-3-2 record;
the squad defeated Furman,
Clemson, and the City of Char-
lotte.

The years rolled by, having
wonderfully successful teams, and

those that were not quite as good.
The only interruption came with
World War II, which left an eleven
year break in intercollegiate com-
petition.

The post-war inaugural sea-
son was not quite as fruitful as the
first season; the team only netted
four goals that year,

- In more recent history, as the
majority of students can remem-
ber, soccer success has sky-rock-
eted. In 1992, Davidson hosted the
NCAA Division I Final Four, the
biggest collegiate soccer event.
That year, in fact, the team made it
into the Final Four, allowing them
to play in front of a home crowd.
The tournament remained at
Davidson through last year; Rich-

‘mond will host this year.

Last year was one of the most
successful seasons for Davidson
soccer, men’s and women’s. The
men finished the season as co-
champions of the Southern Con-
ference, sharing the title with
Furman. The women, in the first
ever women’s soccer season in the
Conference, took the regular sea-
son Conference championship, as
well as the tournament champion-
ship. This year will not be empty of
post-season play, though, even
though the NCAA Final Four has
moved. Davidson will host the
