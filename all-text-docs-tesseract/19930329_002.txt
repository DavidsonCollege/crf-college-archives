Lectureships, the Reynolds is the

_ According to- Kimmel, -this
year's Reynolds lecturer, Angelou,
was one ofa “small list” of candi-
dates that the committee explored
for the event. .

By a unanimous decision, the
Committee agreed to’ pursue
Angelou.

This was the ‘second time

Angelou has béen suggested and °

sought after for the Reynolds lec-
ture at Davidsan. According to
Program, Advisor, Stacy Smith,
“We were lucky in solidifying our
plans with Angelou.”

Angelou, Bill Clinton's inau-
gural poet, has made many accom-
plishments in-her life. Only to
name a few, she was the first
woman editor of The Arab Ob-
server of Cairo, the only English
news weekly in the Middle East
and the northern coordinator for

the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference upon the request of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

She was the writer of the

‘screenplay “Georgia, Georgia,” the

first original script by a black
woman to be produced and has had
ten best selling books including “I
Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.”

Angelou has been awarded
many honors in many different
fields.

These includea National Book
Award nomination for “I Know
Why the Caged Bird Sings,” a
Pulitzer Prize nomination for “Just
Give Me a Cool Drink of Water
‘Fore I Diie,” and a Tony Award
nomination for her performance in
“Look Away.”

She was appointed to a life-
time position as the first Reynolds

Professor of American Studies at

Wake Forest University in North
Carolina in 1981 and was honored
the North Carolina Award in Lit-
erature in 1987;

Despite the vast accomplish-
ments of Angelou, John Meroney,

‘ wrote in The

a senior at
Wake Forest
University
and editor of
the Wake
Forest Critic,

Critic that
Angelou is
falsely cel-
ebrated.
Meroney
claimed that
she iskn6wn
as a “distin-
guished pro-
fessor of
American
Studies” at
Wake Forest

tuality, she offeryno classes, has a
“broom-closet” office, andcollects

Contrary to Meroney’ sarticle,
Rosemary Hawver of Charlotte
wrote in The Charlotte Observer
about her daughters poetry course
taught by Angelou. Hawver ex-

plained that Angelou “expected
only the best from her students”
and that she feels “lucky to have
had [Angelou] be a part of her
daughter’s education.”

About Safe Sex

~ COLUMBUS, OH (CPS) -“‘When

grandmotherly woman as she

strummed her guitar in the lobby

«-MeetJane the Condom Lady. | :

A familiar figure on the OSU
campus, the fifty-something Jane
Scott belts out prophylactic tunes
and passes out condoms in a one-
woman crusade to promote safe
sex and raise AIDS awareness on
campus.

The mother of three sons,
Scott became aware of the dan-
gers of unprotected sex several
years ago and took it upon herself
to leave condoms on students’
pillows, she said in a story in the
Ohio State Lantern, the campus
paper. Her unusual condom pack-
ages are assembled by the hun-
dreds in the basement of her Co-
lumbus home, with members of
the Health Care staff occasion-
ally assisting in the production
line.
