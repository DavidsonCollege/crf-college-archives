PASTOR, RECORD ARTIST, STEPS TO FAME
FEATURING SAXOPHONE AND VOCAL TALENT

Tony Pastor was born in Middle-
town, Conn., thirty-four years ago.
His father was a New England
cabinet maker and was determined
that his son should follow in his
footsteps. Tony did learn wood-

‘working, but from the day he: got’

a saxophone, at the age of 16, Tony
knew that music was his first love.
He admired Jimmy Dorsey's style
of play and aimed to .emulate
JD's musical success.

A year after he learned to play,
Tony was a member of the fam-
ous Commanders under Irving
Aaronson. After three years he
opened his own night club in Hart-
ford, Conn., and featured his own
orchestra. The depression forced
him to close and he joined several
touring bands—Smith Ballew, Joe
Venuti and Vincent Lopez. Next
came a long association with Artie
Shaw’s string band in which Tony
comprised the: entire sax section.
When Shaw took ill at the Hotel
Pennsylvania in 1939, Pastor
stepped in as temporary leader and
soon after Artie’s return formed his
own band again.

He was immediately signed for
RCA and Bluebird’ Records and
landed an engagement at the old
State Ballroom in Bridgeport. Then
came dates at Virginia Beach and
Casa Manana in Hollywood. He
got his first New York booking at
the Lincoln Hotel following Char-
lie Barnet and stayed seven months
on a two-week contract. Next came
the Paramount Theatre on Broad-

tor’s success was assured.

During his career, bandleader
Pastor has been featured on many
recordings. His first contract was
with RCA Victor and . Bluebird.
Following was a brief association
with Cosmo. Pastor’s current plat-
ter pact is with Columbia Records
and has been the most successful
of all. ®

Since switching to Columbia,
Tony has beén responsible for sev-
eral nationally-known hits. “Red
Silk Stockings” was the first and
was followed by “Gonna Get a
Gal,” “There's a Man at the Door”
and “You Started Something.”
Though he always was a leading
recording artist, Pastor did not hit
his first million record until “Gon-
na Get a Gal” was released by Co-
lumbia. Previous hits were “Para-
didle Joe,” “Sunday in Savannah,”
“I Found You in the Rain” and
“Robin Hood” for Victor and Blue-
bird. They all passed the half-
mill mark.

Columbia's 1949 promotion plans
call for an extensive Tony Pastor
‘campaign. The versatile singing
maestro has been given his choice
of material and may select which-
ever songs he feels best suit his
style. Very few artists are given
that consideration by a major label.
But Tony’s showmanship and sales-
manship have proven that jhe is
certain to be among the leaders in
the field of popular recordings
again this year,

“Style,” says Tony Pastor, “is

way, home of name bands, and Pas-.the basis of musical success. The

Communists Paint Distorted Picture of
American Youth at Meeting in Hungary

The American delegation to the
World Youth and Student Festival
in Hungary pictured the United
States to the other delegates as a
place where most young people
“have no jobs at all, and walk
the streets in search of employ-
ment,’ according to an article in
the current issue of The Saturday
Evening Post (Feb. 11).

In an article entitled “How Our
Commies Defame America Abroad,”
Vic Reinemer,.a Montana Univer-
sity graduate, gives a detailed
factual report on the distorted pic-
ture of the United States presented
by the American delegation to the
10,000 other delegates from all
over the world. Reinemer was a
member of a small minority group
in the delegation which attempted
unsuccessfully to have the truth
told about conditions in the United
States.

Reinemer reports that a brochure
printed in four languages and dis-
tributed to other delegates at a
cultural presentation by the Ameri-

-can delegation, said in its intro-
duction: “In a time of developing
economic crisis, the few of us lucky
enough to land jobs face declining
wages, insecure seniority, speed-up
and campaigns of terror and sa-
botage against our unions. But the
greater part of our young people
have no jobs at all, and walk the
streets in search of employment.
Many of us are former servicemen,
our meager veterans’ allotments ex-
hausted, ovr postwar dreams of full
employment smashed. To the ever
louder demand of our youth for

jobs, all Wall Street can answer
is ‘Join the Army.’”

At the Festival Exhibitiqn Hall,
Reinemer writes, the American dis-
play featured a picture of the
Statue of Liberty behind bars.

“Another,” he continues, “showed
a hooded figure hanging a Negro.
Photographs of slums represented
American housing. Well, like most
Americans, I’m not very proud of
slums or the Ku Klux Klan, and
I'm not surprised when communists
play them up. But I was surprised
to see these things presented by the
American delegations as typical of
our country. A number of us felt
that our display should show some-
thing more positive about the
United States as’ well as these
blemishes. But we didn’t get to
first base with that idea.”

Reinemer says “things were dif-|

ferent at the Soviet pavilion,” add-
ing: “The pictures there were
bright, modern day nurseries, beau-
tiful school buildings, hospitals and
resorts.”

The “obvious distortion” in the
picture of the United States con-
ditions was “almost funny,” Reine-
mer comments, until he realized
that to many people “this was
simply confirmation of what they'd
been told.”

He continues: “After all, we were
Americans, representing our coun-
try. Certainly they could take our
word for it. When I realized that,
it no longer seemed funny at all.”

Reporting on the make-up of the
200-memiber delegation, Reinemer
says that they were about equally

“Holiday Affair,” starring Rob-

ert, a department store clerk, gets
fired because of Janet. He tries to
get-up with her and cannot. He
later realizes that she left one of
her packages. Luckily, her address
is on the package, so he goes to
see her in hopes that she will tell
the store manager that he should
not be fired from an error on her
part. He finds a poorly furnished
apartment sheltering a little boy
of five and a boy friend of thirty-
five. Janet is busily cooking sup-
per and trying to straighten out
an argument between her little son
and her boy friend. Robert's ar-
rival makes matters worse. Im-
mediately Robert decides he wants
this very attractive widow, and at-
tempts to win her by winning the
love of her little son. Who finally
wins Janet—Robert, her “steady,”
or her son? You can guess that old

Friday and Saturday

“Ambush,” starring Robert Tay-|

lor, John Hodiak and Arlene Dahl.
The major of Fort Gamble, Ari-
zona sends for Robert Taylor, dar-
ing scout who is mining for ter-
ritory right in the heart of the ter-
ritory held by Diablito, renegade
Indian warrior, escaped from the
reservation with his bloodthirsty
band. The major asks Taylor to
scout out Diablito who has cap-
tured the sister of Arlene Dahl.
Through interest in Arlene Dahl,
Taylor accepts the scouting job.
John Hodiak, recently made first-
in-command, does not have the
ability to attack Diablito. Despite
his dislike for Hodiak, Taylor goes
alorfg and the fight begins—with
Indians, that is ;

bands that gain a definite mark of

recognition are in the best position
to attain lasting popularity.” The
famous bandleader who will appear
in person with his orchestra at
Davidson for Midwinters, is a firm
believer in some sort of signature
through music.

Tony himself makes a good ex-
ample of what he is trying to prove.
His own vocal ability and the man-
ner in which he renders a song are
known to just about every man,
woman and teen-ager in the coun-
try. His voice is unusual, to say
the least, and Pastor is careful to
select the‘ songs he sings. They
must be suited for his style.
Through the years careful selec-
tion and increased activity have
proven invaluable in his rise to
fame. Today a new Tony Pastor
vocal is assured of a large record
sale, songs that achieve a TP plug
are Hit Parade best bets.

Musically the Pastor orchestra
presents an assortment of arrang-
ments that do not follow a_ set
pattern. Ballads receive a special
treatment as do novelties, stan-
‘dards and instrumentals, Yet the
basic quality and Tony's own saxo-
phone choruses, make each song a
recognizable Pastor trademark. His
years of experience have made

Tony one of the most respected ad-
visers in the music business. Those
best qualified to comment say that
his style of singing and playing is
among the tnost popular in the
nation today.

divided between girls and boys,
whose average age was twenty-two.

“Half a dozen were Negroes,”
he says. “Ninety-five were stu-
dents, thirty trade-unionists, and
the others for the most part repre-
sentatives of various organizations

‘—forty from Young Progressives,

for instance, and thirteen from the
Association of Interns and Medical
Students, plus a few free-lancé ob-
servers like Huge (his companion)
and myself. New York City seemed
to have the largest representation.

Reinemer was a student at the
time at the Sorbonne in Paris and
knew when he went to the Festival
that an attempt would be made to
impress the delegates with the “vir-
tues of communism.”

Students Speak On
Missions at Historic
Sugaw Creek Church

Mecklenburg’s famous old Sugaw
Creek Presbyterian Church near
Charlotte played host to three
Davidson boys last Sunday,’ con-
cluding its month of World Mis-
sion emphasis.

Ken Boyer (Korea) Dave Ander-
son (Africa), and Bill Hamilton
(China) spoke at the old church
thraugh the YMCA _ Deputations
Department, sharing their experi-
ences and impressions of the
foreign mission fields with the
adults and young people's group
at both morning and evening serv-
ices. Dr. and Mrs. Charles Robin-
son of Charlotte entertained the
boys in their home for the day.

The boys found out what many
other deputations in the past have
known: that it means a lot to visit
an active, friendly, and interested
“home church.” Sugaw Creek
Church was twenty years old when
another group of Mecklenburgers
were putting their signatures on a
historic Declaration in 1775, but
through the years it has kept alive
and in step with the times, and
now shows an invigorating interest
in world missions. It also boasts a
very large and active young peo-
ple’s group, insuring its future life
and growth.

The Deputation Department of
your YMCA is a channel through
which you can help many local
churches in this area, and also bene-
fit from such friendly Christian fel-
lowship, which is spiritually re-
freshing and mutually helpful. Keep
in touch with Don Shriver for

deputation openings.

Emory Fraternities
Answer Criticisms

Atlanta, Ga. (1.P.J—In an effort
to combat nation-wide attacks on
college fraternities, a definite pro
gram to make Emory University
fraternity system an answer (to
critics was set in motion on this
campus recently. E. H. Rece, dean
of ‘students, in a fetter outlining
the program to fraternity members.
declared, “My hope i that we. can
make the fraternity system work
well enough here at Emory to
demonstrate its value."

To better fraternity-University
relations, the letter urged improve-
ment of pledge training, enforce-
ment of non-drinking rules. re-
duction of expenses and wore em-
phasis on scholarship, A new pro-
cedure for maintaining the Uni-
versity’s rolls of fraternity mem-
bers was announced.

“If freshmen get lost in the crowd
we'll have clubs—not — brother-
hoods,’ Dean Rece warned. Rigid
training was recommended to keep
the fraternity spirit alive in fresh-
men.

Enforcement of house rules bar-
ring alcoholic beverages has been
lenient recently in deference to vet-
erans, the letter continued. But,
it says, this condition will be
changed “and it may be necessary
for someone to get hurt to prove
we mean it.”

More and more parents arc com-
plaining about fraternity expenses,
the dean of students revealed in
the letter. Freshmen, he wrote, are
beginning to ask if it is worth it.
Since food, rent and utility prices
are not going down, social, costs

‘must be cnt, the letter warned.

“Outspending the other chapters
is no great mark of distinction.”
" Reminding fraternities of scholar-
ship requirements for pledge initia-
tions, the Dean's letter stated that
the time to work on freshmen’s
grades is now—not two weeks be-
fore finals.

Note to Professors

Southwestern Louisiana — Insti-
tute’s Vermillion asks students
what habits of professors annoy
them most. Some of the replies
given were: .

“Forgetting that we have other
homework when making . assign-
ments. A teacher should realize that
his courses are not the only ones.”

“Why must professors talk so
fast that one can’t take notes?”

“I hate ambiguous test questions
when only one answer is accepta-
ble.”

“Learning a professor's biography
instead of hearing a lecture beres
me.”

“T am disturbed when an instruc-
tor gives his lecture to the wall or
the window instead of to the class.”

“Teachers shouldn't ask if there
are questions and then say, ‘That
should be: understood, when some
one does want a point explained.’

Men of Distinction
Wear Copeland Hats

Several days ago Mr. W. C. Cope-
land's Shop’ on Main Street was
the scene of a sale which boosted
the business index for hat sales in

the Town of Davidson ,by several

hundred points.

The hats were secured from Belk
Brothers in Charlotte where they
had been in stock for quite a num-
ber of years. They were not of the
style that is demanded by the
Queen City’s men of distinction.
Therefore, Mr. Copeland was able
to offer the hats for a price of 25c.

According to "The Gremlin,” Bill
Stanley, who was contacted for
information on the matter, many
of those who live at the Carolina
Inn capitalized on the sale. Some
even bought as many as four pieces
of the fine quality head wear of
which Stetson and San An Jr. were
two of the make hats offered.

“The Gremlin” let it be known
that there was an assortment in
colors. Among those making pur-
chases at the store, which features
a multiplicity of articles for all
members of the family, were, Brady
Osborne, Bill Johnsey, Bill Free-
man, Bob Gibson, Tom Comer,
Jack Branch, Joe Wilhiurd, and
Phil Mitchell, it was learned from
Mr. Stanley, who himself has been
seen on the campus with an ancient
white chapeau on his cranium.

Mr. Copeland has said that he
might get in some more hats which
he can offer at reduced prices.

THIRTEEN RULES FOR STUDY

Education is a continuous, life:
long process says a feature in the
Chinook of Casper Junior College.
What yor do in school will lay the
foundation for your future success
and happiness. Granting that peér-
sonality may be the most important
factor in successful living, don't
overlook the. fact that you develop
valuable personality traits, such as
concentration, dependability, and
stick-to-itiveness by the way in
which you attack your educational
tasks.

Successful study depends both on
the ability to do college work and
upon serious application. Granted
that’ the student has these, there’
remains. a third very important
factor, that of an adequate study
technique Grapting hoth ability and
serious purpose, the following sug-
gestions may be helpful in improv-
ing methods .of study:

t. Mere reading is not studying,
even though one read his lessons
four or five times. In reading, the
mind is relatively passive. One
follows the words on a page, per-
haps, not even comprehending what
he is reading. Study requires an
active ‘mind. |.ook away from your
book, criticize, analyze, review in
your own words, organize the ma-
terial and integrate it with what
you have already lenrned.

2. Underscoring is often help-
ful, hut too often too much is un-
derlined. Even so, this does not
result in much incredse of mental
activity,

3. Outlining is often helpful, but
be careful of transfering material
passively té paper and feeling vir-
tuous about having “studied.”

4. Learn how to take. lecture
notes. Don't write down everything.
Note the main points of the lec-
turer and some of the subsidiary
points under each. Avoid doing it
mechanically, Review and re-
organize the notes before they be-
come cold. ;

§. Space your study time. Most
students study the night” before.
An hour spent on Monday and
an hour in review on Tuesday will
see you better prepared on Wednes-
day than two hours on Tuesday.

6. Review your work methodi-
cally to avoid hysterical cramming.

7. yourself,, After
studying your lessons, determine
the essential aspects by asking
yourself “just what’ was this lesson
about?”

8 , Test yourself by closing’ your
hook .and answering ‘your own
questions on paper.

9, Prepare , according to test
method. Note the type of questions
used by your instructor, and pre-
pare accordingly.

10.. Concentrate. When — you
study attempt seriously to putt
everything ‘else out of your mind.
Don't “put an time.”

1.) Read for understanding not
just “in order to recite.” Get the
main ideas; the details will) then
be easy. By spacing your study you
may devote your first reading to
pleasurable curiosity. Try to get
perspective, a comprehensive view.
The details will cluster as “iron
fillings to a magnet” if you ‘grasp
your assignment as a whole.

12. Get materials for’ thinking,

Recite | to

Nthen think: Thinking iv largely the

manipulation of facts and concepts.
You can't think without them. And
if you don't have them clearly in
your mind, you can't think clearly
about them.

13. Approach your work as a
self-imposed task, rather than as an
unwelcome assignment,
