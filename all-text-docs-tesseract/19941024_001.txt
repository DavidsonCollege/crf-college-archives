NUMBER 8

By Beth Lindsey

If you have ever found your-
self wondering just what a con-
centration is, you are certainly
not alone. Not a part of the cur-
riculum in many colleges, con-
centrations are a unique part of
the liberal arts education offered
at Davidson. Yet many students
are not aware just what they en-
compass.

“A Little History”

Concentrations were devel-
oped nine years ago during the
1987-88 academic year. At this
time Davidson switched from the
three-term trimester to the two-
term semester calendar. This
change, which gave students
fewer oportunities to meet pre-
requisite requirements, thus pro-
vided the impetus for faculty “to
rethink what departments were
doing with their courses,” says
math Profesor Stephen Davis.

Dean of Faculty Robert Wil-
liams initiated the consideration
of the concentration concept to
the faculty. Says Williams: “It
grew out of the need for curricu-
lar change. I could see that there
were going to be problems if there
could not bea more flexible struc-
ture. I was also really trying to
enable ‘conversations’ to take
place among faculty and stu-
dents—an added level of com-
munication.”

The faculty responded posi-
tively to the idea, and that year the
International Studies concentra-
tion was introduced. From there,
concentrations have been added
as the result of the expressed in-

terest and request of both faculty
and students with the consent of
the faculty as a whole.
The Goal of Concentrations

Concentrations seek to cut
across departmental boundaries
and engage the student in inter-
disciplinary study under the um-
brella of a central theme. Their
interdisciplinary nature is what
makes it so appealing for a liberal
arts institution. Moreover, the
concept of the concentration seeks
“to give recognition to students
who have an interest and can in-
volve that interest in their disci-
pline,” says Davis. The comple-
tion of a concentration appears
on the transcripts of graduates,
thus formally rewarding students
for the. work they are doing ina
given area of study.

The Advantages of
Concentrations

On an administrative level,
“concentrations enable us to be
responsive to changing student
and faculty curricular needs with-
out creating the structure of a
department,” says Williams. Con-
centrations take the courses that
are already being offered and put
them together under a common
theme. Instead of creating new
departments when new interests
arise, a concentration serves as a
more flexible structure for pro-
viding for both the students and
the faculty.

In addition, concentrations
prepare students better for life
after college. “Real world prob-

SGA supports co-ed
freshmen dorms 17-13

By Jay Jennings
SGA took the’ first step to-

. wards co-ed housing at Davidson

by passing a resolution that would
give incoming freshmen the choice
of deciding what type of housing
they receive. After lively discus-
sion, the resolution passed 17 to
13.
The Debate

At the meeting, Senior Class
President B.J. Rudell said that stu-
dents “would not be forced to live
together” and that this resolution
would merely open the possibility

ofco-ed housing. SGA Vice-Presi-
dent Allison Sabel emphasized that
co-ed housing should be a option.
Other students did not feel that
the resolution should be passed.
Senior John Rogers said that
“enough changes occur freshman
year without co-ed housing,” and
the new housing policy would over-
whelm some freshmen.
Independent _ President
Jonathan Orr wanted todo research
on the issue before passing the
resolution in order to fully under-
stand what the change would mean.

He felt the resolution was a good
idea, but wanted research results
before voting took place.

"The Reaction .

SGA President Eric
Rosenbach is “elated that the reso-
lution was passed and hopes that
the administration follows through
on it.” Others are not so happy.

Junior Bill Gullan feels that
passing the resolution was a “‘big
mistake.” Gullan says “it is unfor-
tunate that the SGA has put itself in

Cat cards in Cornelius?

By Russ Tarver

You pull up to the cashier at a
local grocery store with a full cart.
Upon reaching for your wallet, you
discover in horror that your Visa is
suddenly not where you want it to
be. No worries—just give them
your Cat card!

SGA Vice-President Allison
Sabel has established an ad hoc
committee to convince area busi-
nesses to accept Cat cards as a
payment method for goods and
services.

“When I was visiting other
schools, I noticed that many of
them had ID’s that youcould use to
make purchases off campus,” ex-
plains Sabel. “I thought it would be
a convenience to have a similar
system at.Davidson.”

Sabel says that she hopes stu-
dents can eventually use the cards
in campus vending machines and
photocopiers in the library.

After meeting with business
managers in the Davidson Saddler
Square shopping center on Sep-
tember 30, Sabel generated much
interest. All businesses except
Revco were willing to look into the
idea, “‘Revcocouldn’t take the cards
because it’s a national chain,” she
explains.

Davidson Director of Auxil-

iary Services Carleton Pritchard is
quite supportive of the idea; how-
ever, he explained that it would be
expensive to provide businesses
with machines that could read the

- cards,

“Each machine would cost

. around $2,000. Although it would
be a good investment, that’s alotto
ask businesses to pay,” says Sabel.
The school cannot afford to buy
the machines this year, so the com-
mittee is looking for a sponsor and
ways to lessen the expense.

“There is the possiblity that
we could use a smaller box option
where all you would have to do
would be to punch in. numbers
rather than reading the magnetic
strip,” says Sabel. These boxes
would reduce the expense to around
$300 a piece...

Library Director Leland Park
explained to Sabel that in order to
install a Cat card system in library
photocopiers, wires would have to
be drawn from the Commons to
the library.

Although only in the prelimi-
nary stage at this point, the com-
mittee is predicting that students
will be able to use their cards at
businesses in Davidson by next
fall.

“If this is a success, we'll
branch out into Cornelius,” says
Sabel.' “I think it will be really
beneficial for both the students and
the businesses because more stu-
dents would buy from the stores.”
