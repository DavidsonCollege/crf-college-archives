WILDCATS WIN GREAT BATTLE FROM P. C.--3 to 0

Student Body Institutes Honor Store,

To Be Operated In

Basement of Watts

Honor System of the College Put Put to Real Test by the Student

Body. C. A. Young Appointed

Manager by Student Council.

Store Will Handle Eats of Every Kind.

Asa result of an experiment made at

Davidson last year, the student body

will open a “Serve Yourself” store in the basement of Watts Hall within

the next few weeks.

Were it not for the honor system now in effect at Da-

vidson, this store would be an impossibility.

The Student Council, acting as the

3Zoard of Directors for this enter-

prise, have already begun to prepare for business by electing C. .\. Young as

manager,

An Honor Store has been ‘long anticipated
here, but did not become a reality until a
motion was placed before the student body |
last week for its action. The student body
upheld the motion creating the store by an |
overwhelming majority,’ only twelve votes
being cast against it.

Stores of this nature are now being oper-
ated in many of the sister colleges in the
country. Best known of these stores is that
at Washington and Lee, where all kinds of
student supplies are priced, placed before the
students and the cash drawer left open for
the student to make his own change. This
store has been effectively operated for sev-
eral years and is an object of pride of every
Washington and Lee student.

It is the desire of the authorities and stu-
dents at Davidson to make the Davidson
Honor Store one of equal merit with that
of Washington and Lee. The proposition,
instituted this year as a test, will become per-
manently established on the Hill if it proves
successful,

This store will be operated for remunera-
tion to replenish the coffers of the student

Revised House‘ Committee
Announced By Hillhouse

Committee to Serve Students by
Making Dormitory Life More
Bearable

A system recently installed at Davidson |
College, which will prove of great benefit to
the students if used properly, is the House |
Committee, composed of one Senior or Ju- |
nior, from each hall. ee

This system was installed by the Student |
Council to receive and straighten out all com- |
plaints regarding superfluous noises, janitor |
service, lack of hot water, and other such |
cases. In co-operation with the Board of |
Control, this committee also has charge of |
‘certain Freshman regulations; one of these, |
which has recently been put into effect, is the |
mailing system. Under ‘this system, one |
Freshman is appointed on each floor to col- |
lect all mail on his floor at 10:30. The mail |
is then pooled and one Freshman posts it all |
each night to insure early mailing.

With the co-operation of the students the |
committee will be able to insure better living |
conditions in the dormitories. It is hoped |
that all the students will become acquainted |
with their committeeman in order to insure |
a closer working union between the students |
and the committee.
