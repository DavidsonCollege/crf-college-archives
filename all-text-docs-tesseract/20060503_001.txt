Remembering Josiah Cameron

By SUMMERLEE WALTER
Senior Staff Writer

On April 11, Davidson College
mourned the loss of Josiah
Cameron ’09.

According to those who knew
him best, Josiah was a fun-loving
and pursued his own joy.

Josiah would golf at Covington
and, after finishing the round,
would set golf balls in the grass
and attempt to hit them over the
Senior Apartments or across the
baseball fields.

Scott Buckhout ‘07, one of his’

hall counselors on Fourth
Richardson, recalls Josiah’s sense
of humor and his laid-back atti-
tude.

“Josiah would tell me early in
the afternoon that he would be
going somewhere in the evening

where he would need to dress up,
and, when I would ask him if he
planned to change, he would say
‘Maybe,’” Buckhout said. “I’d be
waiting all afternoon to see if
Josiah would dress up or just go,
and he would always come by the
room before he left to let me see
that he’d gotten ready and dressed
up.”

Buckhout also remembers Josiah
constantly interacting with his hall
mates, playing basketball and
goofing around on the hall.

“I always come back to the way
he loved and cared for people who
weren’t loved and cared for by
anyone else,” Buckhout said. “He
was loyal to his friends, but he was
also loyal to the people who didn’t
have friends:”

Some evenings, Josiah would
move through the hall, knocking

on doors and inviting his hall mates
to allow him to treat them to din-
ner.

Josiah would take those who
accepted to Bonsai, and they would
eat their food on one of the bench-
es on Main Street.

His friends say that Josiah
always gave more time to others
than he saved to himself.

Josiah’s visitation and his
memorial service reflected the joy
and the kindness of his life.

At the visitation, held on April
13, members of the College com-
munity had the opportunity to
share memories of Josiah with his
family members.

By the time that the visitation
was scheduled to begin, a large
crowd had already gathered in the

Forum explores options
for former CoHo house

By KATE GILLESPIE
News Editor

Students proposed filling the
vacancy on Patterson Court with a
late-night hangout spot, a new
women’s eating house and a space
for student organizations at last
Thursday’s forum.

The space opened when CoHo
shut down earlier this semester.

President Bobby Vagt opened the
forum by asking students to hold a
“back-and-forth” to discuss the
possible uses for the empty house.

Students then presented outlines
of their proposals.

SGA senators Wilson McCrory
’07 and Gagan Gupta ’07 proposed
reestablishing an Outpost on the
Court.

McCrory and Gupta are mem-
bers of an SGA committee formed
three weeks ago to look into the
options for filling the space.
Although the entire SGA has yet to
vote on the issue, McCrory and
Gupta determined after talking to
current students, past students and
administrators that a new Outpost
would fill a social void on campus.

“Right now, there is not a com-
mon space for students to go,”
McCrory said. “Most colleges, if
they don’t have it on campus, it’s
off campus. Students of all demo-
graphics can come together.”

According to McCrory and
Gupta, while the Outpost could
bring together opposite ends of the

Championship, good enough for third place. It the team’s best

social spectrum, many non-PCC
members feel that Patterson Court
fosters a sense of exclusivity.
~““Twenty-one-year-olds _ hiber-
_ natefin the basemant while non-21-
rors are upstairs,” McCrory
said. “It’s not a place to meet peo-
ple; it’s a place to go with people I
already know. Our size forces kids
into their rooms or off-campus,
which detracts from the sense of
community.”

McCrory and Gupta have not
worked out details yet because they
want students to be involved.

They envision opening the
Outpost from Wednesday to
Saturday and also holding student
meetings, coffeehouses and _per-
formances in the house.

Sara Madison Davenport ’07
proposed a new women’s eating
house.

“There are 12 houses’ on
Patterson Court,” Davenport said.
“Eight of these organizations are
men’s organizations. Each of the
women’s houses has over 100
members. There are less than 80
for all of the men’s houses.”

Davenport said that a new eating
house would create more leader-
ship positions for women on cam-
pus.

She believes that the size of eat-
ing houses keeps women from get-
ting involved and causes them to
drop out. She compared the self-
