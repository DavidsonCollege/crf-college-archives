Y. M. C. A. HEARS
INTERESTING ADDRESS

Rev. A. A. McLean, '06, addressed
the Y. M. C. A. Thursday night, basing
his remarks on Mark 11:24: ‘Therefore
I say unto you, what things soever ve
desire, when ve pray, believe that ye re-
ceive them, and ye shall have them.
Mr. McLean said that the “determining
factor of Christ with the individual is
faith.” This fact is especially shown by
the familiar command with which Christ
performed His miracles. “According to
your faith be it unto you.” This fact is

-

Again our work room has been catled
on to assist with a rush order for Camp
Greene. Two hundred gauze dressings
are our portion, besides new abdominal
bandages. This provides work of great
variety—cutting, folding, basting, stitch-
ing. We shall need more workers than
have been in attendance for the past
week.

As the spring comes on, it will mean a
greater sacrifice to the workers to con-
tinue the Red Cross work, but we shall
have to bear in mind that we are pre-
paring now against the needs of our
own men. We cannot now let our hos-
pital supplies run short. Not while our
own are ‘‘over there.”” One of our Red
Cross workers in France says: “While
the men here are doing their part, we
all realize that it is made possible by
the people at home doing so much, and
without their help little could be done.
Ik ‘s a wonderful help to feel we have
all U. S. A. back of us, working hard,
giving their time, and money _ freely.
That alone would make anyone do his
best.”

ture also for Christ always required
some evidenc~ of faith before he would
command ‘Thy sins be forgiven thee.”
It is a common error for people to hope
for everything for which they pray. The
promise, as quoted above from Mark
11:24, seems to be unlimited in its literal
interpretation. However it has litita-
tions: (1) There is the natural limita-
‘tion that the promise is not made to
Christ’s enemies; (2) We can not hope
for God to answer prayers the answers
to which would work harm to us: (3)
What man thinks best is not alwavs best
in the mind of God. The lesson is that
faith should have a warrant and the
warrants for faith are found in the Bi-
Hle. In the Bible are promises of com-
fort to the worried, of strength to the
tempted. and of assurance of salvation
to the doubter. In order to find the
promises that meet our particular needs
we have to know our Bible. Prayer is
also a means of assurance and revelation.
“Prayer implies communion and com-
munion jimplies two persons.” Once
God has revealed Himself He nevet
changes that revelation and having re-
vealed to us our particular duty He will
not change that revelation until that
duty is discharged. ‘What more could
we ask than that the promises he express-
ed in plain words as in the Bible and
that they be experienced as in praver.’'

BATTLE RAGES IN GEORGIA.

John L. Sullivan is dead, but his
spirit keeps living on. No more striking
evidence could be wished for than the
47-round combat staged last Monday,
when Harrell, the Heavyweight Holo-
caust of the Elysian Boulevard, and Lis-
ton, the Alert Agerivator of Alabama,
inet for the Bull Slinging Championship
of Mecklenburg County. Both of these
pugilists have long been recognized as
the leaders in their art by all members
on the campus, and when they met for
the final combat betting was about even
as to the result. Both fighters have un-
dergone severe training, as is evident
from the vast amount of “Zip” that has
been consumed by them during the past
months. The fight went on at a terrific
pace, and both fighters were exhausted
when the referee brought the matter to
an end. Liston, the Whirlwind Whaler,
showed magnificent foot work, and rush-
ed his opponent with the same spirit he
displays .in debating before the Eumen-
ean Society. But the Terrific Tornado,
Harrell, came back with wonderful
force. and put up an excellent defense
as well as a vigorous attack. Both fight-
ers seemed to direct their attention to
face blows, and especially aimed at the
mouth. The object in this attack seem-
ed to disable the other's talking powers,
for both realized that could he but stop
his opponent from talking, he would be
sure to win the day. In fact it would
have been a fairer test if the two con-
testants had been placed opposite. and al-
lowed to talk away until one or the other
succumbed. This would have been pret-
tv rough on the audience. however, and
in these davs when the brutal parts of the
prize rine have been banished. it is prob-
ably well that the onponents confined
themselves to fighting and let the talking
contest alone. Liston announced that
he was fighting to make the world safe
for democracy. while Harrell declared
in favor of no annexations. and no in-
demnities. Both of the gentlemen were
also in favor of peace without victory.
A maenificent purse of $37.98 which was
to go to the winner was generously do-
nated to the War Work of the Society
for the Promulgation of Promiscuous
Pugnacity.
