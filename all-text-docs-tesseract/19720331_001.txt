Student Input Needed In Governance

By RICH WILSON
Editor-in-Chief

(This is the third in a series
of articles entitled “‘Campus
Governance: Crisis of Author-
ity.”)

In Davidson's governance sys-
tem all students are second
class citizens. At certain lower
levels in the decision-making
process they are granted token
input, but in most major de-
terminations, they are excluded
from any meaningful participa-
tion.

Just this past fall, the faculty
vetoed a proposal to allow stu-
dent representation on the Ad-
missions Committee and the

Budget, Building and Grounds
Committee. ve

It was also during the falf
that the faculty rejected all pro-
posals to allow student observ-
ers in faculty meetings.

While students are adequate-
ly represented on many faculty
committees, they have been sys-
tematically excluded from most
planning on a departmental lev-
el, and they have been excluded
by the faculty as well as the
administration from having a
say in the final decision-making

‘process.

If students are to help a col-
lege realize the goals it has set
for itself, they must fully un-
derstand what these goals are,

as .well as the plan by which
the college hopes to achieve
these goals.

If students are involved in the
budget making process, they
might understand better why
their tuition has been raised.

Similarly, if students are in-
volved in setting the calendar
for the next year, they might
understand what problems exist
in such planning.

But at Davidson, student loy-
alty to the goals of the institu-
tion are not encouraged. In most
cases the students feel the col-
lege is working against them
rather than trying to help them.

Consequently, students have no
qualms about “ripping off the

college.” To them the college is
impersonal, The college does not
seem to respond to their needs
in such areas as student life;
therefore, they do not respond
to the college’s need for student
cooperation in such areas as ad-
missions or cutting costs.

A second argument offered
in favor of increased student
participation in governance is
that students are a good judge
of a professor’s teaching effec-
tiveness.

Neither an academic vice pres-
ident nor a department chair-
man can effectively assess a
professor’s teaching ability as
well as the student who sits
through the professor’s class

Bevan, Cornell
Express Criticism

Of Football Study

By ALEC HOON
Managing Editor
Reaction among the admin-
istration to the SGA Committee
Report On Football has been
for the most part critical of the

study.

Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David
Corneli was disappointed by the
*‘incompleteness"’ of the report.

“I still think that there are
a lot of unanswered questions.

‘I found the results to be
very interesting, but I was dis-
appointed that they did not do
a comparative cost analysis of
subsidized and non-subsidized
football,’’ Cornell said.

Cornell also noted that, con-
trary to the report's findings.
savings could be realized in non-
subsidized football in such areas
as coaching and recruiting.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan was
critical of the fact that the con-
clusions were speculative, with
no facts to back them up.

“The report creamed the top,

but did not dig into the issue,”
Bevan stated.

Bevan was also bothered by
the fact that the report gave no
indications of the costs of non-
subsidized football.

When presented with the state-
ments from Bevan and Cornell,
Bill Meier, chairman of the
Football Committee, defended
his committee's report.

“I agree with Cornell and be-
van in that there are a lot of
unanswered questions. They are
right about the cost analysis be-
ing superficial.

‘However, there ar? several
reasons for this. First, in being
students, the committee was spe-
cifically denied permission to
see a line by line college foot-
ball budget by Cornell.

“‘We could also not get accn-
rate data from other schvols,
such as Washington & Lee and
Centre College, who have non-
subsidized programs Tfecause
they too refused to release the
facts,’ Meier said.

Meier noted that with the ab.
sence of such information it was
impossible to prepare a compa-
rative cost analysis. He said the
committee had been anxious to
get these facts so that they
could have made such a report.

He explained that Washington
& Lee switched to a non-subsi-
dized program in 1954; and that
the committee had wanted to
get their budgets in 1953 and
1954 to use as a rule for compar-
ison,

*‘We asked Cornell to get such
information for us, which he
could, but he refused, saying
that he didn't consider that ‘re-
levent or helpful’,” Meier noted.

Meier also contended with
Cornell's assessment that mon-
ey could be saved in non-subsi-
dized football for coaching and
recruiting.

“This is erroneous. We would

every day.

Students can make _ helpful
evaluations of a professor’s prep-
aration and interest in his lec-
tures and discussions.

Student participation in gov-
ernance can also close the wid-
ening gap in professor-student
relations. Only the student real-
ly knows what interests him.
Unless a professor can under-
stand these interests and chan-
nel them into a learning experi-
ence, the educational process
here will flounder.

This is why it is so important
that students at least have some
final say in curriculum planning
and educational programs even
though the faculty should act as
the guiding force and exercise
dominance in this area.

Student participation in gov-
ernance would also open chan
nels of communication among
the constituencies and provide
for more understanding between
these groups.

However, many faculty mem
bers argue that students are
transient and therefore they will
not suffer the possible effects
of their input. Such arguments
falter when one considers that
the average term of a college
president is four or five years.
And with faculty members peri-
odically leaving on sabbatical.
students may have more years
of continuous governance expc-
rience than either faculty o-
administrators.

It is also important to notc
that governance is a continuin;,
process. Decisions and _ struc-
tures are constantly modified
and reinterpreted to fill chang-
ing conditions: ccmsequently.
there is no reason why students
should not take part in gover-
nance during their four vears
here.

If they should make a mi
judgment, like all decisions, °:
can be corrected by future ge

SGA Establishes Committee
To Handle College Complaints

By TODD EADES
Contributing Editor

The Student Government Asso-
ciation has established a Griev-
ance Committee. Its purpose is
to find answers to complaints
from members of the college
community and to act as a link
between the different member
groups of the community.

The Grievance Committee was
begun when the SGA _ Senate
passed a resolution from Sena-
tor Steve Suflas in its March 7
meeting. The committee met
for the first time last Monday,
when it received several in-
quiries and decided to act on
well-known problems of its own
initiative.

The members of the commit-
tee are Bruce Batten, Woody
Connette, Mike Creasman, Skip
Holcombe, John Hornickle, and
Bill Rolland.

In a newsletter distributed to
the student body, the committee

outlined its operating proced-
ures. Any complaints or ques-
tions may be submitted to the
committee at its weekly meet-
ings on Monday at 10 p.m. in
the Union Bar, or submitted to
any of the members at any
time during the week.

Cases will be kept confiden-
tial if the individual submitting
the problem so desires.

The need for such a commit-
tee is reflected in numerous
general complaints by students
about their problems in effec-
tively dealing with the persons
responsible. The committee will
attempt to cut through admin-
istrative red tape and resolve
the communications gap _ be-
tween the persons involved.

One of the first actions of the
committee will be to determine
and define the areas of respon-
sibility of decision makers. It
will also attempt to obtain fac-
ulty representation on the com-

mittee.

Members of the committe.
emphasized that the services «/
the committee are available to
anyone — students, administrii-
tors, faculty, and townspeopl-:.
and that the committee will ac:
cn complaints involving any (.
these groups.

Mike Creasman, a Senior Clz .«
Senator and a member of th.
Grievance Commitiee said, ‘‘c>
ly action will define the purpos::
of the committee. We’re here :,
help students, faculty, admin’‘s.
trators, townspeople — anyo >:
who has a grief. It is our ho-s
that those people who have
problem will confront us.”

Skip Holcombe, also on t':-
committee, spoke of the goals ..
the group saying, “our imme
diate aim is to find a solu.i..
to the problem, but more iii
portantly we hope to eliminiite
the cause of the problem in t!:2
future.”
