During this crisis, Gibson .

noted, metaphors of medicine,
gaming, and even rape have been
used. She referred to the popular-
ity of such phrases as, “surgical
strike”, and “antiseptic war”, as
well as the continued use of gam-
ing language to describe the con-
flict.

George Bush’s description of
the Iraqi invasion as a “ruthless,
systematic rape” in his State of the
Union address and other examples
of violently sexual language which
has been associated with combat
also inspired discussion. Finally,
the conference spoke about the
underlying metaphor of big busi-
ness in any discussion of war. For
whatever reasons, the language of
“costs” and “gains” has permeated
the war, as nearly all other areas of
life.

Gibson passed out copies of a
resolution passed by the National
Council of Teachers of English in
1971. The resolution makes her
interest in language and the abuse
thereof quite clear: “Although
teachers of English do not make
national policy, we should do what
we can to free public language and
thought from manipulation by the
powerful. Beit therefore resolved
that the National Council of Teach-
ers of English find means to study
the relation of language to public
policy, to keep track of, publicize
and combat semantic distortion by
public officials, candidates for
office, political commentators, and
all those who transmit through the

Mass media,”

The conversation progressed
into a discussion of the justice
behind the war. Philosophy pro-
fessor Dr, Robert Maydole pre-
sented a list of criteria, (his own
compilation and interpretation of
the ideas éxpressed by such phi-
losophers as Plato, Aristotle, St.
Augustine, and St. Thomas Aqui-
nas) which explain the nature of a
just war, and argued that, accord-
ing to these criteria, the war with
Iraq was just.

First on the list was a require-
mentof“justcause”. In Maydole’s
words, “war may be waged only if
there hasbeena wrong done andan
injustice committed which has
resulted from aggression. Iraq’s
aggression against Kuwait made
the cause just. They invaded a
peaceful neighbor, killed thousands
of Kuwaitis, raped women, robbed

3 bane took hostages, reigned ter-

r, threatened chemical and bio-
iowical attacks againstanyone who
might try to stop them, annexed
Kuwait, and claimed a Pan-Arab
right to do it again,”

Next was the necessity of “right

_ intent’; in other words, “war may

only be waged for the purpose of

_ restoring peace and justice.”

Maydole claims that “the allies
motive for entering the conflict
was to liberate Kuwait. The USA
might have desired cheap oil and
regional hegemony; but not all
desires are motives for action. Itis
possible, moreover, for political
aims and moral motives to coin-
cide.”

"War must also be the last “rea-
sonable resort, and only after all
peaceful means have been tried or

day's Gulf Crisis Conference.

seriously considered,” if it is to be
considered just. Maydole refers to
the repeated attempts on behalf of
several world leaders to persuade
Iraq to leave Kuwait. Iraq’s re-
fusal to cooperate diplomatically
left force as the only viably effec-
tive alternative.

Anyone who would wage war
must also possess "Legitiamte
Authority". War can only be un-
dertaken by “legitimate and com-
petent authority.” In terms of the
Persian Gulf crisis, Maydole cites
the resolution passed by the United
Nations Security Council author-
izing the use of force.

Fifth on the list is a “Declara-
tion of War: War may be waged
only if the persons who will be
affected have been informed, when
reasonable, that it will be forth-
coming.” Maydole states that “Iraq
was _giyen.a_satisfiable deadline
for withdrawing from Kuwait, and
told that failure to comply would
result in war.”

“Hope of Success” is also
mandaey toa just war. Only war
which is ‘ ‘very likely to result i in a

just peace” can be considered just.
The superior military capability of
the Allies satisfies this require-
ment for Maydole.

Maydole’s list presents modi-
fications of proportionality and
discrimination in his description
of a just war. Proportionality, as
modified towards modern warfare,
specifically the war in the gulf,
mandates that the “actual harms
caused by going to war must not
exceed the harms that would result
form not going to war; and the
risks of harm caused by going to
war must be less than the risks of
harm caused by not going to war.”
For Maydole, “‘it was far better to
suffer few casualties and small risks
now than massive casualties and
great risks later.”

Modified discrimination re-
quires that “‘military action must
notbe intentionally directedagainst
innocent persons and noncombat-
ants; and the risk of harm” to the
innocent must also exceed that of
not going to war. Maydole points
out in the list, that the Allies con-
