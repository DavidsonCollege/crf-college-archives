“spark.”

In the first 20 minutes of the
season’s action, the Wildcats had
been “sparked” into a 20-point
lead three different times in an
unexpected power drive. In the
waning minutes of the game, the
freshman played with the same
“spark” for all but 33 seconds.

On last’ Tuesday, the Red and
Black came out of a first half
deep freeze during intermission
and caught fire with that “spark”
;getting them the lead at 67-66,
culminating an effort to overcome
a 14-point deficit with 15 minutes
remaining. The brains of the Da-

ON THE HARDWOOD

With only two games played, it is difficult to tell how the
Cats will perform on the hardwood throughout the season,
but a few things have been worthy of notice.

Probably the most notable is a lack of experience.
Of the starting five listed on the roster three are sopho-
mores—Semi Mintz, Joe Milner, and Dave Hollingsworth.

Of the remaining two, Mike Martin is a junior who saw
limited action last year, and Captain Dick Weeks is the lone
senior. There are only two other four-year members of the

More specifically, this “spark”

nically, this is no “semi-spark”—
its the Wildcat of the Week, Semi

DOUBT ERASED :
Basketball fans have noted changes in the physical ap- i
pearance of Johnston Gym. The red lights behind the back-
boards have been added as a result of last year’s extremely ‘
close and exciting game with VPI. Many will remember that = A

shot a field goal that could have tied the action. Because of
the ensuing debate about whether he shot before or after the
buzzer, the red lights have been installed this season to give
a visible indication of the buzzer sounding, particularly to in-
dicate the end of the half or of the game.

TOURNAMENT SCENE

The schedules for the starting rounds of the holiday
tournaments in which the Cats will participate have recently
been announced. Davidson will open against St. Joseph on
December 17 in the Carrousel Classic at Charlotte's Coliseum
and will meet Pennsylvania in the first round of the Richmond
Invitational on December 27. Both are stiff tests.

Opening the season last Friday
and Saturday with a quadrangular
meet, Davidson's wrestling team
won one match, and dropped two
others. The meet, held at Marshall
College in Huntington, W. Va.
matched Auburn, VMI, Marshall
College, and Davidson.

Auburn, who has won the
wrestling crown for eight consecur
tive years, won all three of its
matches. Each of the other schools
won one and lost two.

Pete Coleman lived up to
pre-season expectations and
was the outstanding performer
for Davidson. He won one
match by a pin and decisioned
another opponent.

Dave Fagg, Westy Westervelt,
and Milton Gee also looked good
for the Cats. Gee won one match
and got a draw in another to take
runner-up for Davidson.

it was just by a stroke of
luck that Pete Coleman was
able to get to the match.
When the team left Davidson
fast Thursday, Pete couldn't
go because he was reported
overcut.

After searching through the cut
records, Pete found that he had
an excused absence and was
therefore eligible to make the trip.
Since the team had already left,
he caught a plane from Charlotte
and arrived in Huntington only
two hours later than the team.

Tomorrow the squad meets in
an away match. Since this is only
the second year that Pfeiffer has
had a team, they should not offer
too much competition.

However, .a tough match is
scheduled for next Tuesday when
the team wrestles at UNC. The
