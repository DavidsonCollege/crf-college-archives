‘Cats must take one more confer-
ence game to cinch a berth in the
meet at Memorial Auditorium in
Raleigh on the fifth and sixth of

March.

Coach Eddie Cameron of Duke,
chairman of the Southern Confer-
ence basketball committee, has ap-
pointed Dr. R. R. Sermon of State
to make arrangements for the play-
off. The drawing will be made at
College Park, Md., (during the con-
ference boxing tourney there)
among the first cight teams in the
final standing and the complete
schedule will be announced Feb.
27th. Our prediction is that Wash-
ington and Lee, South Carolina, and
either Maryland or Richmond will
scrap it out with our Big Five for
the title. All officiating has been
wisely put into the hands of M. P.
“Footsie” Knight from the Dur-
ham “Y,” Gummy Proctor from
Richmond, and Paul Menton, a Bal-
timore sports scribe.

While on the subject of the hard-
wood game some people want to
know what the ’Kittens have been
playing recently? The prize boner
goes to Bennett Harrison who scor-
ed his only field goal of the Davy-
idson-Wake Forest game for the
Baby Deacs. This brings to mind
an incident that happened in the
Duke-Davidson frosh football game
which was played in Asheville a
few years back:

Late in the game after the sun
had sunk behind a ridge Davidson
had the ball deep in her own terri-
tory. A double reverse was called
and in the course of events a Blue
Imp lineman knifed into the play,
received the ball intended for a
‘Kitten back and headed for his
goal; but before he had gotten a
good start one of his teamnrates
broke through and brought him
down, mistaking him for a David-
son man in the dusk. Well, we
guess that one kind deed deserves
another.

Casting an eye on events closer
by. we find track, baseball, tennis,
and golf invading the campus. All
of these will be taken care “of in
their time, so let’s mention some
sports that we would like to see in-
vade our list of extra curricula ac-
tivities. Judging from the popular-
ity of the equipment in the old
gymn and the skill with which cer-
tain students perform on it we be-
lieve that a competitive gym team
would be a credit to the college.
Traveling with the cage squad or
mat team they would spice up the
program and increase attendance
if played up in good fashion, The
suggestion will probably die with
this issue of The Davidsonian, but
there are some who would like to
see the idea mature. It can be ar-
ranged because some of the cage
attractions feature such perform-
ances during the half period.

Washington and Lee, North Car-

the Southern race
during the past week. The race be-

cided as is also the case among the
next six teams in Conference stand-
ing.

Features of the week's play were
the defeat of the top ranking quin-
tet from W. and L. by the Duke
Blue Devils and Carolina's subse-
quent impressive win over Duke.
This established the White Phan-
toms as the outstanding favorites
in the forthcoming tournament at
Raleigh. The one-sided triumph of
Davidson over favored Wake Forest

in the Deacon's lair, and South
Carolina's victory over the State
Red Terrors had an _ important

bearing on the Conference race.

3y far, the most important game
of the week will be the meeting be-
tween North Carolina White Phan-
toms, who have been on a rampage
lately, and the league-leading Gen-
erals of W. and L. in Lynchburg
Saturday night in the game which
will determine the tournament fav-
orite. First, however, the Generals
will have a chance to avenge their
lone defeat when they meet Duke
at Lexington on Tuesday night.
State must win from both Duke
and Wake Forest this week to re-
main in the Conference race.

the Demon Deacons will go a long

The wiser followers of the South-
ern Conference have finally been
overheard in their side-line selec-
tion for the tourney. The following
eight teams have been honored in
this gossip circle: North Carolina,
Duke, North Carolina State, Wash-

WLOKTIENS LOSE T
TWO BIG FIVE RAL

Davidson Freshmen Show
Power in Clash With State

The Davidson freshman basket-
ball team dropped two contests to
powerful Big Five opponents last
week.

The first loss was to the Junior
Wolves of North, Carolina State.
30th teams played a good brand of
ball during the first half and at its
close only three points séparated
the opponents. At the opening of
the last stanza the State Frosh be-
gan using their superior height to
advantage and ran up a lead that
could not be overcome. The Kit-
tens made a determined bid toward
the close of the contest but the gap
was too great to close, and State
left winner by eleven points,

In their meeting with the Demon
Deacons of Wake Forest the Kit-
tens lost by an overwhelming score.
The little Deacons, showing what
is probably the best freshman club
in North Carolina, exhibited a well
knit attack backed by a powerful
defense to walk off with the hon-
ors. At the beginning of the second
half the Kittens seemed to come to
life for a brief period and started
hitting the basket, but otherwise

Tryouts Will Be Held at Caro-
lina Club, Charlotte,
March 1-13

Ralph McClelland, captain of this
year’s varsity golf team, issued a
call in chapel Tuesday for appli-
cants for this year’s team. Tryouts
for the team will be held from
March Ist to 13th at the Carolina
Golf Club in Charlotte.

This was a call for all men to
get in shape, who expect to go out
for the team. The play will be 72
holes medal play, and the low four
will compose this year’s varsity.

Four lettermen returned to school
this year. These were Maples, Mc-
Clelland, Ross, and Snow; and these
men are expected to form a good
nucleus for the varsity this year.
Combined with members of the
strong freshman team last year and
some upperclassmen; this year’s golf
team is expected to be among the
best since the sport started here.
McClelland, Ross, and Snow have
played together for the last three
years.

After the four low men are
selected for the varsity, the next
four will compose this team, the
number one man of the “B” team
being varsity alternate,

There will be three matches here
before spring holidays with Cataw-
ba, on March 20; and also Hamp-
den Sydney, and the University of
Richmond. The schedule as a
whole has not been: worked out as
but Davidson is expected to
enter as usual iv the
ment, the Southern Conference
tournament, and—the—Southeastern
Intercollegiate tournament in Ath-
ens, Ga.

McClelland says that it is hoped
that stronger interest will be mani-
fested, and it is urged that as many
as possible try out for the team.

best record of any spring sports
team, winning 14 out of 18 matches,

Teams to Play Decisive Game
Here Saturday

With Ned Iverson and Johnny
Tice in the hero roles, Davidson’s
cagers romped to a 43-31 victory
over the Deacons in Wake Forest
Saturday night.

Coach Laird used a bit of strategy
and started the diminutive Tice,
scrappy sub forward, at guard, with
orders to stop Jimmy Waller, sen-
sational sophomore who has been
averaging 14 points a game. Tice
did a beautiful job of guarding him
until he fouled out. Then John
Armstrong took his place and also
turned in a very creditable per-
formance. While these ‘two were
holding Waller to threéfield goals,
Iverson was ringing up nine for a
total of 18 points to walk away with
high scoring honors. Waller and
Morris ‘of Wake Forest tied for the
runner-up position with 11 points
each, closely followed by J. D.
Hicks, Davidson center, with 10,

Davidson led, 28 to 17 at the half
and ran its lead up 13 more points
before the Deacons scored in the
second half. With ten minutes to
play, the home team rallied, but was
unable to overtake the fast-moving
wildcats.
