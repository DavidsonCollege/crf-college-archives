Union budgets overdrawn,
confused accounts blamed

By BILL BARNES
News Editor

Three departments of the
college Union have overspent
their alloted budgets for this
fiscal year, according to Union
President Karl E. Goodhouse.

Goodhouse said that confu-
sion accounted for much of the
apparent deficit. ‘It’s no one’s
fault,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s the fault
of the process. I don’t know
who’s to blame.”

Deficits have appeared in
the 900 Room, Programming
and Vice Presidential Contin-
gency funds, though no deficit
has appeared in the Union
budget as a whole. The 900
Room deficit, which runs to
$2472.57, is the greatest, and
is interwoven with the Contin-
gency Fund deficit.

Goodhouse said that expen-
ses came out of the Contin-
gency Funds for which no
budget allocations have been
made. He cited specifically the
apartment where performers
stayed while at Davidson.
“This has effectively wiped
out any monies we had,’’ he
said.

The confused budgetary
system is at least partly at
fault for the 900 Room deficit,
according to Goodhouse.
“We've got no receipts from
the Comptrollex’s Office for

door fees taken in,” he said.
“‘So our books show deficits
where theirs don’t.”

Union Vice President Ro-
bert M. Mayer, in charge of
social monies, including the
900 Room funds, agreed about
the confused monetary alloca-
tions. ‘‘No one knows how it
works,”’ he said. ‘‘We have ‘X’
amount of money but we’ve
had committees where trans-
fers have been forgotten,’’ he
said, referring specifically to
the cost of the musical 1776,
which had been allocated to
the Cultural Events budget
but forgotten.

Mayer also commented on
the lack of communication
between the Union and the
Comptroller’s office, saying
that several deposits were
totally missing. He was not,
however, surprised at the 900
Room deficit.

“T knew I was going to have
to overspent my budget in
that room this year to get it
established among students
and artists,”’ he said.

“TI expect to lose every
penny of my budget on that
room,” he continued. ‘‘I want
to stretch it as far as I can.”

Union Director C, Shaw
Smith does not see the prob-
lem as a major one, as the
budget as a whole has not been

Shiekh Ali defines
fourth world need

MATTHEW COVINGTON

Shiekh Rustum Ali, foreign
Service Officer of Bangladesh
assigned to the embassy in
Washington spoke at David-
son this week about the poli-
tics of oil and the fourth world.

Ali defined a ‘‘fourth world”
country as a non-communist
country with per-capita in-
come between.$75 and $200 a
year. Bangladesh is one of
these countries.

Bangladesh is described by
Ali as an egalitarian country.

“There is equal distribution
of everything to all of its 75
million people,’’ said Ali.

Bangladesh is a country
where 85 percent of the people
are dependent on agriculture
for employment and suste-
nance. It is a country without
a wealthy class. ‘‘We have no
Henry Fords or John Rocke-
fellers,’”’ said Ali.

Bangladesh is also a coun-
try that has been hurt by the
rise in crude oil prices in the
last few years.

‘Industrial nations have
had no real trouble with the oil

price hikes. These countries
can borrow against their in-
dustry for money to pay off oil
debts,” said Ali.

“The countries that are
hardest hit by high oil prices
have been the fourth world
countries,” he continued. The
fourth world has a debt of
$75,000,000,000, or about 40
percent of the world’s debt
incurred through purchase of
oil.

“Bangladesh has been the
hardest hit of the fourth world
countries,’ said Ali. They
have had to spend
$125,000,000 for oil in 1975 as
opposed to $25, bea 000 in
1973.

According to Ali, thin dras-
tic increase in oil prices will

seriously effect» the fourth

world countries who cannot
afford to pay the prices being

asked by middle eastern oil

exporting nations.
“One fourth of the world’s

population faces tremendous.

change in its life style as a

result of increased oil prices to

fourth world-nations,’’ baid

stretched. He also credits the
internal problems to confu-
sion.

“The big problem with the
whole thing,’’ said Smith, ‘“‘is
so much detail. And we don’t
have a person to devote three
hours a day to it.’

Smith said that he merely
approved payment, and that
allocation of monies was in
student hands. ‘I do this on
the basis of what I’m told by
students to do,” he said.

Goodhouse is in the process
of appointing an ad hoc com-
mittee to audit the Union
Budget and detect misalloca-
tions over the next six weeks.
This committee consists of
Bradley Swalwell, Bo Hunter,
John Trout, College Comp-
troller Robert W. Davidson,
and College Business Manager
Robert A. Currie.

SINGER/MUSICIAN Raun McKinnon will present
two shows in the 900 Room this Saturday,
January 31 at 9 pm and 11 pm. Admission is $2 for
both students and faculty/ staff

ions to an open meeting next

“This draft is not going to
be anywhere near. the final
draft, as far as I can see.”

Union President Karl E.
Goodhouse outlined the con-
tent of the by-laws and the
effect that the proposed docu-
ment. would have on the
operation of the Union. ’

“In a sense, what the draft

cerned with programming.

the Executive Committee) will
