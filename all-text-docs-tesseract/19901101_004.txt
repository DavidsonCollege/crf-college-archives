The Senatorial Race &

Davidson Values

“Let Learning Be Cherished Where Liberty Has Arisen.”
These are the words found on the Davidson College seal.
However, this motto is far from applicable to the work of Mr.
Jesse Helms as North Carolina’s three term Senator. Learning
seems to be his least “cherished” value. Why?

Mr. Helms cast the only negative vote against the Higher
Education Act Amendments which provide aid tocolleges and
college students. |

Mr. Helms voted several times against the funding for Pell
Grants which assist lower-income students in gaining access
to post-secondary education. .

Mr. Helms voted to eliminate the State Student inboniie

Grants program, a Federal-State cost sharing partnership —
which promotes the development and expansign of need-
based education grant program.

Mr. Helms voted to eliminate the College Work-Study
program for the federal budget. .

Clearly, his voting record doesn’t benefit Davidson which,
according to the Statement of Purpose, ° ‘must Constantly...
increase its financial resources.’

Ina recent ad, Mr. Helms boosts abouthis record in helping .

education in North Carolina. Yet, the commericial lists only
four programs he has sponsored or helped. Is that all Mr.

Does Davidson Volleyball Exist?

To the Editors:

I am irate! I cannot be-
lieve that in the last two is-
sues of the Davidsonian
there has been no mention of
the Volleyball Team! Here
is a team that has one of the
best records, if not the best,
in any sport at Davidson
College and yet your paper
fails to acknowledge they
exist!

The Charlotte Observer

has disappointed me in their
lack of coverage on such a
great Team, but goodness, I
guess! can’t faultthem when
the school paper doesn’t
mention them atall! Atleast
the Observer has the box
scores.

Iam sure Terry Holland,
since he has attended all of
their home games, would
have been more than happy
to have had his picture half
that size in order to have had

an article on the progress of
the Volleyball Team!

Sincerely,

M. HATHAWAY

[Editors’ Note: We apolo-
gize for poor coverage of
volleyball. Unfortunately,
there have been production
problems with sports. We
hope last week's article
remedied your disappoint-
ment.]

Sieck Lacks Theatre Insight

| To the Editors:

I beg you to indulge me
by hearing a few words in
defense of the theatre de-
partment’s production of A
Streetcar Named Desire.
Well, in all honesty I am not
defending the production. It
needs no defense.

What! am doing is trying
to convey to Ms. Sieck the
simple message that she
should limit her public
commentary to those topics
about which she has more
than paltry knowledge. She
apparently placed no such
limits on herself during her
experiment with theatre
review in last week’s
Davidsonian.

Ms. Sieck’s “review” of
= Streetcar’ in last -week’s
| Paper was in fact a bit of
observation that in no way
resembled even remotely an

know only enough to recog-
nize my lack of expertise in
either direction or review of
theatre productions in gen-
eral, I feel that my experi-
ence as a member of the

actual review. Although I.

‘Streetcar’ casthas givenme
certain insight about that
particular play. . insight that
Ms. Sieck obviously lacks.

Jennifer’s principal
mistake was in assuming that
she could “review this play
without previous knowledge
of it.” Inchoosing to do that,
she practically assured her-
self of missing the whole
point of Williams’ work.

Had she been familiar
with the concept of theatre
review, Ms. Sieck would
have known that a working
knowledge of the script and
of the playwright’s style are
essential items. To embark
upon a review of a produc-
tion without these provisions
is to set sail on very stormy
waters indeed.

‘Because of-her lack of:

preparation, Ms. Sieck
viewed ‘Streetcar’ with the
narrowest of all possible
perspectives. Her contempt
for the play was based on her
dislike of the social struc-
ture in our fair nation in the
1940’s. Ms. Sieck is op-
posed to “abuse of women
by men” and to the fact that

women and ethnic minori-
ties were in the 1940’ slocked
into their traditional stations
in society.

What Ms. Sieck failed
to see was that ‘Streetcar’,
rather than glorifying the
social structure in America
in the 1940’s instead givesa
very moving illustration of
the unfortunate circum-
stances that were probably
not uncommon then; she
failed to see that this par-
ticular production was prac-
tically blind to traditional
ethnic biases; she failed to
see so much that I can’t
imagine it having been worth
her time to attend. ;

' T'dlove to.continue, but
I've robabfy sais to mach
already. I hope Jennifer has

leamed :avaluable:.esson

from. my. gentle chiding.
Perhaps her next attempt at
review will be. based on a
more thorough understand-
ing of the production in
question. “

Sieck Needs Social En:

gineering

To theEditors:

What a hostible review
of a wonderful production

Helms could accomplish in 18 years?

Harvey Gantt, the former mayor of Charlotte and Demo- ©

cratic candidate, understands the importance of higher educa-
.tion. As the first black student admitted in Clemson Univer-
sity, Mr. Gantt recognizes education as an important aspect of
human development. Like Davidson’s Statement of Purpose,
he believes that higher education can “develop persons of
human instincts, of disciplined and creative minds.”’Mr. Gantt’s
education at Clemson helped him achieve his personal suc-
cess.
Simply put, Mr. Gantt represents progress for North Caro-
lina’s higher education system. It is Mr. Gantt, not Mr. Helms,
who represents Davidson values.

10

of A Streetcar Named De-
sire! Jennifer Sieck's social
engineering would do to
drama what USA Today has
done to journalism.

Please consider the fol-
lowing points:

1. The play is set in the
French Quarter of 1940’s
New Orleans, NOT 1990.
Does the cast wax nostalgic
and treat this as some sort of
last Arcadia to which we

must return.

2. The play and the cast
NEVER display violence
_against wom
in favorable lights.

3.Dramas, especially
challenging ones, need cata-
lysts. In Streetcar, physical
and psychological violence
afe the catalysts. Try to
imagine aplay withoutsome
sort of catalyst.

*°4. Violence andracism.

exist in this world. Is it
somehow morally wrong to
point out a societal wart?
Ignoring a problem won't

make it go away. It is so
easy to jump on the politi-
cally correct bandwagon, .

agenda, and so easy to thus
sacrifice a mind at the altar
of intellectual fascism. Ican
only hope that the next time
that Jennifer Sieck watches’
a play, that she will check
her high-faluting ideologi-
cal blinders at the door.

THOMAS W. GRANT '91
