South Asian Projects

By JIM PAULSEN

After over three - years of
operation, SASASAS (Southern
Atlantic States Association for
South Asian Studies) has writ-
ten proposals for a quarter of a
million dollars worth of projec-
ts, all of which have been fun-
ded and implemented.

SASASAS is an_ institution
which was formed by Davidson
and other colleges to help raise
funds for and stimulate the
development of South Asian
study programs in_ the
southeastern part of the United
States.

“The benefits to Davidson
College from all the activity of
SASASAS include the SASASAS
programs running on campus
and the publicity that Davidson
has received regionally and
nationally, including the fact
that Davidson College is seen as
the prime mover institution is

SASASAS,”’ said Frederick
Gaige, Chairman of the
Executive Committee of

SASASAS and professor of
South Asian Studies.

Gaige pointed out that there
have been numerous other
benefits from SASASAS beyond
the funding and coordination of
South Asian programs.

One such benefit has been
sponsoring a two year program
to. assit profesors of Asian-
African studies in developing a
training program designed to
aid the instructors of the North
Carolina public schools in
teaching Asian-African studies.

Even more than benefiting
regional interests and member
institutions, Gaige said that
SASASAS has opened two
programs to people across the
nation. One project will send
college presidents and deans to
India to observe the Indian
educational system.

partly due to the FUNDS

A second program which is
just now being proposed plans
to send teachers of dance,
music and drama to India to
study these subjects and
hopefully incorporate Indian
dance, music and drama _ in
their courses.

‘We have plans to develop a
rotating seminar between
SASASAS campuses. which
bring in nationally known
specialists of South Asia to
speak to interested students and
faculty,"’ said Gaige.

‘‘We will also sponsor a con-
ference on internationalization
of the undergraduate curri-
culum for interested faculty
and administrators from all
over the Southeast,” he added.

Other future projects include
coordinating plans for study
abroad in South Asia among
member institutions, and
development of a union catalog:
for South Asian materials and
for a interlibrary loan system
for these materials.

“It is amazing how much the
association has accomplished in
terms of raising money and
developing programs,’’ said

Gaige.

of SASASAS include a summer

Bell Strives F or Resurrection

Of Football F unding Debate

By PAUL WELCH
Staff Writer

In conjunction with the SGA
Athletic Committee, sophomore
Senator Stephen Bell last week
opened what he calls a ‘‘cam-
paign’’ to insure that the
Trustees of Davidson College
are kept informed of true
student and faculty opinion on
the subsidization of the David-

betterment of the college.

Perhaps the greatest con-
tribution that these people
make is in the field of their own
individuality.

Each of the international
students at Davidson this year
brings with him a freshness

manifest of the new experience
that this college and this coun-

try is to them.

They also bring a wisdom -
the wisdom of objective outlook.
The comparisons with other
countries and other schools that
these students will make are
fascinating and usually flat-
tering of Davidson.

The_majority of these stu-
dents came to Davidson
through the International Scho-
lars Program.

The prospective student must
submit various essays and ap-
pear before various review

‘boards before being accepted

for a scholarship. The com-
petition for these positions is
great, and the recipients are of
high caliber.

One of these students,
Nadeem Faizi of Pakistan,
spoke glowingly of Davidson. ‘‘I
have travelled in this country
from Miami to Tennessee, and

Davidson is the most unreal
place among these.’’ He added,
“I like to say it is most like
Heaven.”

Other students echoed
Nadeem's praise. Alexander
Bol of Holland suggested that
“Everybody here tries to help
you; there is a brother in-
fluence."’

On the subject of co-
education, the students, par-
ticularly the males, voiced in all
cases the belief that co-
education is good.

“You're not living a full life if
you don’t mix up with girls,”
said Tarun Prabhakar from In-

son football program.

Theresolution was passed bya
very small plurality, with three
senators abstaining.

In Bell’s opinion, the majority
of Davidson students favor the
desubsidization of football, but

the trustees are unaware of this
fact.

Bell submitted to the SGA last

dia. ‘There should definitely be
girls.’’

“I think girls should be
provided a chance to come
here,’’ said Faizi. ‘‘Boys find
how the other half of mankind
perceives things."’

The range of opportunities
available here at Davidson is
another subject of high praise
for the college. It seems that
Davidson only lacks a cricket
team from being perfect. The
variety of sports available for
study is a source of wonderment
for international students.

‘“‘Here, I play soccer, I use
the weight room, and almost
anything I have time for. In
Holland, I would beg for an
hour to get a ball to play five
minutes, and, even then, the
fields might be in use,” said
Bol.

The students say that their
experience is enriched by their
host families. These people act
as friends for the students and
perhaps entertain them when
studies permit.

“I guess in a small college
you have the advantage of a
host family that you couldn’t
have in a larger school,’ said
Prabhakar.

Perhaps the only criticism is
that the students of Davidson

learn but do not examine. The ©

Davidson student comes to
school with an embedded
background and does not stray
from his hedonistic pursuits.

Faizi reminded that Aristotle
once said, ‘‘A life unexamined
is not worth living.”’

a resolution for the
desubsidization of football (i.e.,
the discontinuation of the prac-
tice of granting football scholar-
. Ships).

The dissenting senators made
sure that the trustees were
made aware of the closeness of
this vote at their last meeting in
the spring of 1973, when sub-
sidized football was one of the
main topics under discussion.

“I can’t help suspecting,’
said Bell, ‘‘that the closeness of
the vote cast doubt from the
trustees’ point of view as to
whether or not the majority of
students really were in favor of
the desubsidization of football.

‘I think that this is one of the
more blatant examples in
recent years of Senate
misrepresentation of actual
student attitudes.”’

The first step in the campaign
came in the form of a letter
which was placed in all the dor-
mitory mailboxes during
Homecoming Weekend.

Distributed by the SGA
Athletic Committee, the letter
called attention to the fact that
the continuation of subsidized
football supposedly costs each
student $160 annually. This
works out to a cost of $40 per
home game this year.

Bell also intends to try and
start a letterwriting drive with
the goal of letting the trustees
know how Davidson students
actually feel about the football
program and its place at David-
son.

He says that there will
probably be more letters sent
out to students and other at-
tempts made to stimulate
student interest prior to another
meeting of the Board of
Trustees in late October.

The resolution he submitted
to the SGA last spring will also
be presented again in the Oct. 16
meeting of that body, with
perhaps more representative
results.

“Hopefully,” declared Bell,
“the result of all of this will be a
more positive contribution by
the students when the Trustees
again consider the issue of the

desubsidization of football.”
