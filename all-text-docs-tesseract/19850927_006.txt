Staley Speaker Lectures On Christian Conversion

By HEIDI HOOKER

The Staley Distinguished
Christian Scholar Lecture Pro-
gram featured Dr. John Mulder
speaking on “The Roots and Fruits
of Conversion” last Wednesday
and Thursday nights.

Mulder began his Wednesday
night lecture by discussing the ap-
proach and process of developing
Conversions, published in 1983.
His research required collecting
first-hand conversion experi-
ences, of which he ended up with
50 of great variety, to help him un-
derstand the richness of the con-
version experience.

His overail lecture theme con-
cerned the two emphases inherent
in the Christian faith: the central-
ity of conversion and the mystery
or variety of conversion. He made
frequent references to the Gospel
and other historical testimonies
associated with the conversion ex-
perience.

Mulder presented his perspec-
tive on the different types of con-
version accounting for the diffi-
cutly of differention since all
genres do somewhat overlap. He
discussed dramatic, gradual,
wholly, intellectual, moral or
ethical, and aesthetic conversion
and their characteristics. He
explained that though dramatic
conversions are the most popular
in literary accounts, the gradual,
wholly intellectual, and moral
conversions are signigicant and
more common though less apt to
publishing.

Mulder also explained that the
aesthetic conversion, in which
one converts in reaction to or
realization of the beauty of God
and his Grace as revealed in nature
or the arts, is one of the least-ap-
preciated dimensions of the
church and religious attitudes
today. He pointed out the “im-
poverishment of the religious ex-

perience . . .” because we rely so
heavily on the sermon to com-
municate and ignore the aesthetic.

As a model of conversion,
Mulder chose one of the three ac-
counts of Paul’s experience from
the book of Acts. He stressed un-
derstanding the nature of conver-
sion with the metaphor of the jour-
ney represented in this account.
On this journey away from home,
“God’s grace breaks in on one’s
life,” Jesus confronts one, and the
persons reorients their life, being
converted or “turned around.”
Mulder related such a conversion
experience to adolescents away
from home.

Resistence and depression
were also pointed out in the lec-
ture as characteristic to the con-
version process. Mulder des-
cribed the experience as a “Buck-
ing against the force of grace until
one finally submits.” The conver-
sion resulting is a “private experi-

ence of God’s grace . . . in isola-
tion from the world” which Mul-
der describes with the image of
“scales falling from the eyes.”
However, Mulder believes that
conversion is mediated through
persons so that “we are not saved
by ideas but by a person who helps
us come to terms with the reality
of God.”

In reference to his work on the
book Conversions: The Christian
Experience which he edited with
Hugh Kerr, Mulder lectured on
the phenomenon of conversion,
focusing on its process, types and
characteristics.

Presently Mulder is president
and professor of historical Theol-
ogy at Louisville Presbyterian
Theological Seminary in Ken-
tucky. In addition, he acts as an
ordained minister in the Presbyte-
rian Church (U.S.A.) and now re-
sides on the Editorial Council on
Theology Today, of which he has

DERS Provides Quick, Essential Service

By MARGOT MIMS

Your roommate falls off the
top bunkbed and complains of a
broken arm. What do you do? Call
DERS (Davidson Emergency
Rescue Service, an on campus,
student run organization) at 892-
3031. The nurse on duty will re-
quest the following information
— location, mechanism of injury
and a call-back number — and
then will proceed to dispatch a
DERS crew. Within three minutes
of the call, two qualified
Emergency Medical Technicians

(EMT) and one trainee will arrive
at the reported location. The re-
maining steps involve putting the
arm in a splint, in this particular
case, stabilizing the patient and
calling the ambulance. In short,
DERS not only saves its patients
valuable time, but also offers its
services free of charge.
According to senior Olivier
Van Dierdonck, the administra-
tion has really been supportive.
Last year, Van Dierdonck, the
president of DERS, requested fi-
nancial aid in order to update

some dilapidated equipment. The
Dean of Students office granted
his request. The police depart-
ment reserves a 24 hour parking
space for the DERS squad car,
Van Dierdonck said. He points
out, “All Davidson students
should have the minimum reading
capacity to read our Emergency
Vehicle Only sign.”

The unmistakable trust be-
tween DERS and the administra-
tion stems from the reliability and
competence of each member on
the squad. Presently, twenty-two

students participate in DERS.
Half of the students hold a current
EMT certificate and the remainder
are trainees. To obtain an EMT
certificate, one must take a 120
hour EMT state certified course.
This course requires every partici-
pant to take a 6-part practical
exam and to pass with an 80 aver-
age. In order to have a DERS crew
on call 24 hours a day, Van Dier-
donck assigns different shifts to

the members of the squad.
Melissa McLemore, Jody
Minus, Don O’Malley, and

also been a member of the writing
staff.

He received his A.B. from
Hope College in Holland, Michi-
gan and his M.Div. and Ph.D.
from Princeton University, where
he and College President John
Kuykendall were colleagues.
Mulder served as Associate Pro-
fessor of American Church His-
tory at Princeton Theological
Seminary. He was general editor
of the volume series The Library
of Living Faith, published by
Westminister Press, and he has
been author and editor of several
books and essays on theology and
church history.

This was Mulder’s second
visit to Davidson. Mulder made
himself available for his two day
stay to speak with students and
meet with the CROP organization
and Religion 141. His book Con-
version: The Christian Experi-
ence is available in the book store.

Olivier Van Dierdonck are the
elected officers of DERS this
year. These four officers stress
that all information received about
a case remains strictly confiden-
tial.

If any student would like to
become involved with DERS, he
or she should contact one of the
previously mentioned officers.
Van Dierdonck stated that DERS
is “a good experience for the stu-
dent as well as a good service to
the college.”
