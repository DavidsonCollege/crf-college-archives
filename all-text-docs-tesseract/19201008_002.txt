CAPTAIN HAMMETT.

Lawrence Orr Hammett, Captain |.

of this year’s football team, and star
tackle, is a man who will long be re-
membered at Davidson for his work
on the gridiron. His name is al-
read written large in the history of
Carolina football.

Coming here from Clemson with
a big “rep” he has not only sustain-
ed it but has added to it until he is
now regarded as the premier line
man of the South Atlantic States.
Noted for his fighting on the offense
and stone wall defense, he was the
logical man to lead the Wildcats
this season. In every game played
this year he has received mention by
all the newspapers because his op-!
ponents have been outplayed and,
outgeneraled.

Hammett weighs about one hun- ,
dred and eighty pounds and is all
In both the games this year
he has been outweighed twenty
pounds but he has more than held,
his own.

As Captain he is doubly effective ; |
keeping his side of the line solid and
unbreakable, and instilling the wild- |
ness into the Wildcats.

about 186 pounds while the back-
field totals up 170 pounds. There
are three men on the team weighing
two hundred pounds or over. These
giants are, Caldwell, Johnson and
Al Staton.

The line that will probably start

the game against the “Red and
Black Machine” is as follows: Amis,
center, with Lebey and Johnson on
either flank. Fincher and Al Staton
seem to have the call on the tackles,
as do J. Staton, kid brother to the
aforesaid Mr, Staton, and Granger
on the ends.

The bleachers at Grant field are
being strengthened and enlarged to
accommodate the crowds that will
attend the Davidson-Tech game. The
football artists from the southern
metropolis are looking forward to
the hard fought game that they have
always had with the Wildcats, but
one thing they don’t know yet is
how small the score is going to be.
The men under Coach Grey have
been beaten but they don’t know
the word conquered, and they are
going to try their best to stop the
Tornado and do to them what was
done twice last year.

“Go get ‘em Wildcats.”
