The Art of Following

There are plenty of leaders out
there. After all, our society breeds
them. We pick our kids out of the
playground games. The ones who
are telling others who to kiss and
when to kiss them are the leaders.
The ones who speak up inclass and
ask questions — no matter how
dumb they might be — are consid-
ered the ones who take initiative
and speak their mind.

We hand-pick these budding
Stars and put them in our “acceler-
ated programs.” When they hit
junior high, we help them run for
president of the class. When they
hit high school we help them run
for student body president, captain
of the football team, and head
cheerleader. We love these people.
We tell them how well they repre-
sent us, and we wish them well in
life.

More times than not, these

former childhood leaders take the
confidence we gave them in high
school and use it in the rest of their
lives.

Many times they become
presidents of companies, politi-
cians, and teachers — some of the
positions our society praises and
respects most. These kids go on to
have successful lives and we say,
“What fine leaders they are!”

My question is, what happened
to the followers? Did we have any
special programs for the rest of the
student body that gave these lead-
ers their power? Did we give a
special award for the best follower
of the year? How about the ‘guy
who would argue the philosophies
of the president of the Key Club,
show his point of view, but ulti-
mately support anything his leader
decided? Did we give any awards
to that guy?

Of course we didn’t. We dis-
courage followers. “They have no
spine,” we say. “They have no
self-confidence,” we condescend,
And that, my friends, I sincerely
believe to be the fundamental prob-
lem with our government. We
have put all of our pride and joy in
the apple pie leaderand completely
devaluated the importance of the
follower.

I have never been a big fan of
old Billy Clinton. To tell you the
truth, I was a Perot fan. I cam-
paigned for Ross, wrote to him,
slept with his book, and yes, even
voted for him. Call me stupid, call
me Texan, but I loved him.

On that infamous election day,
however, when old Bill beat the
crap out of my hero, I put my head
down, cried, and then got.over it.
Bill was the new President of the
United States. Whether I liked him

or not, there was nothing Icould do
about it. SoI began to support him,
and I still do.

Unfortunately, I do not think
the majority of us do support our
President. As of the Super Bowl,
Clinton had a record low 47% ap-
proval rating. Our country has
turned against Bill, our one and
only leader for the next two years.

Sol guess that’s it. He’s gone,
out of office, no longer has any
influence. But the problem is, he’s
got two more years on his contract,
and we can’t get rid of him unless
he starts to suddenly swing from
the chandeliers in the White House,
screeching like a monkey.

He’s not getting anything
done? Of course he’s not getting
anything done. With 47% support,
how is he supposed to be able to
breathe without being afraid he’s
going to get somebody infected (I

hope that made sense). Here we
have atrue leader. He was ascholar
from first grade. He was president
of more clubs than have ever been
a member. He was a Rhodes
Scholar. He’s a public speaker,
and he’s in great shape (OK, maybe
that’s stretching it).

The pointis, we have a leader.
We voted him in. Now, it’s our
responsibility to help him. Yes, we
all want to be the leader. We all
want to make decisions. We all
want to be “important.” But we
can be leaders and still be follow-
ers at the same time. That is the
most important sacrifice we can
make. It is time to turn around our
complaining caps, rally behind our
leader, and give him the support he
needs. It’s time for us to be follow-
ers. It is our time to take pride in
the art of following and praise oth-
ers that do the same. It is our duty.

Differences are
encouraging

Bill Gullan says that as
Davidson students, “There is more
that unites us than divides us. To
live together peaceably, we only
need to tap into it.” I believe there
is more that divides us than unites
us. The fact that we all study at
Davidson is not more important
than each of our backgrounds and
.cultures.

I agree it is best, in a perfect
world, to treat every individual
equally; but this is not a perfect
world. Because students do not
respect and treat each other equally,
itis appropriate for the administra-
tion to support those who have it
hardest.

The truth is, we the students
do not create an accepting, encour-
aging, and curious atmosphere at
Davidson. Some try, but it is too
easy for others to look away. We
‘spend a painful amount of time
resting contently because we are

the “eighth best liberal arts col-

lege” and too little energy chal-
lenging our easy lives. Too often,
we cruise through each day with-
out feeling forced to question or to
rethink our particular ways of life.
In fact, this “rigorous” and
“challenging” Davidson experi-
ence is not rigorous or challenging
enough. I think the challenge of
college should be in evaluating
what we learn, not getting the work
done or making it to the weekend.
Similarly, we should challenge our-
selves socially by not always do-
ing what is comfortable — espe-
cially when that means learning,
understanding, and accepting
another’s culture and way of life.
Instead of all the inane, com-
placent chatter, why don’t we con-
verse and communicate more?
Why don’t we really try to know
and share ourselves with those who
are different from us? We can at
least take advantage of the little
diversity we have. oe

Bill is right when he states
that we should celebrate our dif-
ferences “if we’re learning from
each other,” but I think we should
be doing more learning and more
celebrating. Learning from each
other should be the norm, not the
exception. Because this is not the
case at Davidson, it is appropriate
for the administration to recognize
minorities. as groups and try to
compensate.

If the students do not actively
strive to accept various cultures
and perspectives, the college needs
to help those outside the norm deal
with that fact. When Davidson’s
dominantly white, conservative so-
cial life is comfortable to some-
one, it is easy for him or her to
overlook how one-sided life here
is. For this person, it is easy to say
that everybody has an equal op-
portunity. But those of us who
don’t identify with the particular
Davidson way of life realize how
biased and suffocating it is.

“In light of the students’ self-
constricting social attitude at
Davidson, a supplementary (not
“separate” as Bill stated) black ori-
entation, or any minority event
alike, is nothing to be concerned
about. Because blacks, in particu-
lar, share a common thread which
must be defended here each day, a
meeting just for blacks hardly
should be disturbing. It is a time
for those with a common differ-
ence to get a head start in the chal-
lenging social life at Davidson. I,
in fact, envy the experience. To
me, the culture shock I, as a liberal
male, experience each day is hard
enough. I can’t imagine the shock
if I weren’t white.

Get to know us

I would like to applaud Dean
Shandley and the group of profes-
sors that spent a night last weekend
in the dorms. With all the changes
that have occurred over the last
few years, it is encouraging to see
the administration making an ac-
tive effort to gain insight into the
students’ lives. Hopefully, pro-
grams like this will continue.

Since I came to Davidson, I
have been continually shocked by
the extent of misunderstanding that
exists between the students, fac-
ulty, and administration. I remem-
ber hearing stories about “the old
days” when faculty would hang
out with students at. fraternity and
eating house parties.

I don’t know if these legends
are true, but I would like to see
moreinteraction of this or any other
kind. Professors these days seem

. to think that they need to remove

themselves to gain respect from
their students. I beg to differ. Per-
sonally, I find it a lot easier both to
respect and to relate to someone
that I know as a person.

There is no reason why stu-
dents and faculty should separate
themselves so much. I’m not say-

ing that the history department
should all go to a fraternity party
and get sauced, or that the math
department should have a FAC
with kegs and a band. I am sug-
gesting that both faculty and stu-
dents should make more of an ef-
fort to interact’ outside of Cham-
bers.

Obviously the gap between
students and the faculty is too large.
We can see this in many of the
policies passed over the years. Last
Ichecked, the purpose of a college
was to improve the lives of its
undergraduates.

We pay over $20,000 a year,
but I sometimes wonder whether
the administration really takes into
accountthe welfare of the students.
Lately, it seems that college offi-
cials are more concerned with im-
proving the reputation of the school
and their own careers than the lives
of the students.

I think many college employ-
ees have lost sight of the essence of
a college: students. Why do the
faculty continually push to abolish
fraternities when the majority of
the students avidly support them?
Why does RLO spend more time

assigning fines than trying to im-
prove the quality and maintenance
of the residence halls? Why does
the scheduling committee plan
breaks at times not supported by
the students?

If the faculty and administra-
tion continue to make decisions
ignorant of the students’ feelings,
a rift will always exist. Such a rift
only causes controversy and de-
tracts from the quality of the col-
lege.

The effort needs to come from
both students and faculty. When
hiring new faculty members and
accepting new students, we need
to look for people that can effec-
tively interact with many different
groups. ;

Isincerely hope that more pro-
grams like last weekend’s will sur-
face during the Shandley years.
There is no reason why students
and faculty can’t watch a game
together or have drink together or
play sports together. Who knows,
we might even find each other in-
teresting. But certainly, through
interacting we will gradually un-
derstand each other — and that is
better for everyone.
