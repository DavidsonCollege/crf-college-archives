1930 Wildcat Football
Schedule Is Completed

r

Sites for Carolina and Wake-Forest
Contests Yet Undecided

With the signing of a contract with Ers-
kine College to be -played at Davidson on
October 4, the 1930 football schedule of the
Davidson College Wildcats has been com-
pleted, and the places of all contests have
been definitely arranged with the exception
of the Carolina and Wake Forest frays, ac-
cording to Capt. Norton G. Pritchett, direc-
tor of athletics here.

The completed Davidson card gives the
Wildcats ten engagements, five of which are
with Southern Conference foes—the same
number encountered last fall, Four of the
mixups will be played on Richardson Field
at Davidson, one is definitely scheduled for
Charlotte and another is likely for that city,
one in Greensboro, and the others on the
home fields. The Carolina game will go
either to Chapel Hill or Davidson, this to be
decided by the officials at the University of
North Carolina.

Captain Pritchett stated that the Citadel
authorities had decided to play the Citadel-
Davidson game in Charlotte, instead of
Charleston, S. C. It is a home game for the
Bulldogs, but they wanted to return to this
section for the battle. The Wake Forest
game will either be in Charlotte or will be
played in Davidson.

The 1930 card follows: ;
September 20—Elon at Davidson.

September 27—N. C. State at Greensboro.

October 4—Erskine at Davidson.

October 11—Duke at Durham.

October 18—Citadel at Charlotte.

October 25—V. P. I. at Davidson.

November 1—V. M. I. at Lexington Va.

November 8—Wofford at Davidson.

November 15—Carolina at Chapel Hill or
Davidson.

November 27—Wake Forest at Charlotte
or Davidson.

on to the Davidson postmaster, who handed
the pocketbook to Doctor Lingle. The most

although everything else was in the pocket-
book.
