Alcohol Law Enforcement

issues On-campus citations
Agents follow two intoxicated students .

By SUMMERLEE WALTER
Senior Staff Writer

Eight Alcohol Law Enforcement
(ALE) agents followed two intoxi-
cated Davidson students onto cam-
pus, entered a Martin Court apart-
ment building, and wrote its occu-
pants multiple citations on
Saturday, November 5.

Many students expressed shock
over ALE’s presence.

Despite some confusion, ALE,
the division of the _ state’s
Department of Crime Control and
Public Safety that primarily
enforces laws dealing with the sale,
purchase, consumption, and pos-
session of alcoholic beverages, had
the right to investigate anyone on
Martin Court that night.

The roads running throughout
campus are public and therefore

fall under the jurisdiction of state
and local agencies rather than col-
lege administrators.

“Students really need to be ...
aware of their surroundings and of
the breadth of the law. They might
be surprised what they find out,”
Director of Public Safety and Chief
of Police Fountain Walker said.

Initially, ALE’s presence in the
town of Davidson was unrelated to
the college.

ALE officials, along with high-
way patrol officers and representa-
tives from local agencies, were in
the area on that night as part of an
ongoing investigation concerning
the recent kidnapping of two peo-
ple from the Cornelius club NV
Lounge.

Union, Tomlinson to
receive new computers

By AMANDA STEPHENS
Staff Writer

In response to problems with
moisture and flooding in the Belk
computer lab, ITS will move 10 of
its computers to the fourth floor of
the Union in early January.

A high-capacity printer will also
be placed on the third floor by the
telephone.

Four of the new computers in the
Union will be located outside of
the Libertas office. There will also
be one computer on each side of
the fireplace.

ITS director Mur Muchane
stressed that the computers on the
fourth floor will not function like a
traditional lab, and that the area
should blend in with the Union’s
ambience. The computers will not
be staffed.

ITS will also set up a‘fiew mini
lab on the third floor of Tomlinson
‘where the TV lounge is currently
located.

The new lab will have eight
computers and a laser printer.

The new lab is ITS’s response to

number of people who use the Belk
computer lab live in Tomlinson
Dormitory.

“As we transition to a new era in
Information Technology Services
(ITS), we are placing special
emphasis on enhancing informa-
tion technology services to stu-
dents, faculty and staff,” Muchane
said. “Our goal is to both deliver
better service and to gain a better

‘understanding of what the campus

community wants to accomplish
with information technology. We
hope that the new student comput-
ing facilities in the Union and in
Tomlinson demonstrate our com-
mitment to improve service to stu-
dents.”

Some students, however, are
questioning why ITS is choosing to
put the computers in Tomlinson.

“If they are going to put another
computer lab in, why not put it
down the hill,” Lux Shepard ’06
said.

Sean Chan ’06 agreed.

“Tomlinson is so close to Belk
Lab,” Chan said.

Student runs for County Commissioner

By JILLIAN BARTELS
Staff Writer

Student Government Association
(SGA) Senator Sam Spencer ’07
has tentative plans to run for
Mecklenburg County

Commisioner in the fall of 2006.
According to Spencer, his young
age is an advantage in this election.

School,

Spencer is familiar with the issues
facing schools and the need for
school reform.

“I’m running because North
Mecklenburg needs a representa-
tive who understands our schools
and what needs to be done to fix
the problems,” Spencer said. “I
didn’t graduate from North
Mecklenburg High School when it
was 80 to 90 percent white and
under capacity. I graduated recent-
ly when it was struggling with
issues of overcrowding and bomb
threats. I talked to my teachers on a
daily basis about these problems,
so I’m attuned to how people on
the ground feel. about our educa-
tional challenges.“

Spencer said the county’s recent
rejection of the school board bond
issue on the November ballot sug-
gests people are disillusioned with
the current system.

If elected, he intends to bring
hope back to the area, which he
said has grown cynical over the
past 10 years.

“We don’t have the schools we
need. We have rampant, out-of-
control development that’s fueling
many problems, including school
overcrowding. We’ve lost hope
that we can fix these problems,”
Spencer said.

Spencer said he is qualified for
the position and “will bring a
unique and desperately needed per-
spective to the board.”

In addition to his SGA position,
Spencer’s qualifications include
working for Democratic Senator
Joseph Biden and former President
Clinton last summer. ,

Spencer is planning a “simple
grassroots” campaign. “The grass-
roots style allows a candidate to
interact more with real people—real
constituents with real concerns,”
Spencer said. “Sometimes, politi-
cians forget the people that they
represent, or they forget that they
represent more people than those
who voted for them. I never want
