World Cup soccer comes to Davidson

By Will Cobb

Five weeks ago, the United
States National Soccer Team ap-
proached Davidson College with
the opportunity to host a World
Cup exhibition match giving a pre-
view of what is to come this sum-
mer in cities all over America.
Davidson was able to work out a
deal that will feature the United
States versus Moldavia on Wednes-
day, April 20, at 7:00 p.m. on Rich-
ardson Field.

The event is expected to be a
quick sellout. Tickets will go on
sale exclusively for Davidson stu-

dents and faculty at 9:00 a.m. on
Wednesday. Reserved seating in
the stands will be sold for $16.50 a
ticket while standing room for
adults will go for nine dollars. No
additional bleachers will be in-
stalled, so all seats will be at a
premium.

Davidson will offer standing
toom seating between a three foot
advertisement fence and the sta-
dium. A special section of 500
tickets for 12 and under children
will be available at $4.50 a piece,
while another standing section for
500 people will be offered for ages

13 and older at nine dollars apiece.
All seating in the stands will be
offered on a first come, first served
basis.

The ticket office has. already
received several phone calls ask-
ing for information. “I wouldn’t
wait until school starts back [from
Spring Break] to get tickets,” said
Charlie Slagle.

The United States squad will
feature the team that will compete
this summer, including goalie Tony
Meola (UVa), Brad Fiedel
(UCLA), Thomas Dooley (En-
gland), Jeff Agoos (UVa), 1990

World Cup members Desmond

Armstrong and Paul Calquiri, and
Alexias Lalas (Rutgers), who was
featured in Sports Illustrated last _

month. The team will be coached
by soccer missionary Bora
Moltinovak, who coached Mexico
in 1986 and Costa Rico in 1990.
The United States will face
the Moldavian National Team.
Moldovia is a region of Bessarabia
which was incorporated into the
U.S.S.R. earlier this century by
Joseph Stalin. The Moldavians,
who are primarily of Romanian
decent, should have a playing style

similar to that of the United States’
first round opponent, Romania.
“This is the next step in the
evolution of what we’re trying to
do here. They came to us, and they
are promoting their own game,
which they don’t do that often,”
said Slagle. If the match is a suc-
cess, the possibility for future
matches will be enhanced.

The game will simulate a
World Cup match. The lowest price
for a World Cup ticket this sum-
mer will be $45, so the maximum

tainly should not be limited to one
department.”

Davidson's sailing team took first place in Saturday's regatta, the first home competition for
the new team. Second at the Clemson regatta, the Davidson team is now first in the North
Points Division of the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Because the top two
teams oi ihe district go to the national championship, Davidson team believes it has a chance
to compete at the Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut. Hallam Walker, Davidson's coach
from 1966-85, returns from retirement to coach the new team. See story on page 13.

Two spring breaks scheduled in '95

By Mary Clare Jalonick

Next year, the calendar in-
cludes an Easter Break and a new
exam schedule.

The Faculty Executive Com-
mittee instituted an Easter break
due to a number of complaints
from students and faculty. The
break will last from Friday after
classes through Tuesday, giving
students four days off near the end
of the spring semester.

The break will fall on Monday
and Tuesday rather than Thursday
and Good Friday. Easter Sunday is
adifficult travel day, and the sched-
ule will enable families to spend
all day together on Easter, says Dr.
Alan Singerman, a member of the

. committee.

However, the addition of an
Easter break, however, will not
affect the length of Spring Break,
which will remain at ten days.
Spring Break will be in the first
week of March rather than the third
week,

Singerman claims that an ear-
lier spring break was instituted “to
take some fatigue out of the sys-
tem.” The committee is attempt-
ing to shorten the period between
Christmas break and Spring Break
which students often find unbear-
ably long.

In order to compensate for the
days lost during the new break, the
spring semester will begin on Janu-
ary 16, three days earlier.

Fall exams will now be ad-

ministered on Sunday in order to
push the winter break release dates
back one day to December21. This
change was not noted on calendars
sent to parents, but they will soon
receive the revised version.

The exam schedule continues
to cause controversy. The Faculty
Executive Committee decided to
institute Sunday exams as a result
of numerous student complaints
andSGA petitions. Some students,
however, are still not satisfied with
the schedule.

of the Educational Policy Com-
mittee, is composing a letter to
