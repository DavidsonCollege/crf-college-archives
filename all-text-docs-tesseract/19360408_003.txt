Two Sound Movies Show
Wonders of Science

The second series of moving pic-
tures in one week was presented in
the Chemistry bifilding on Friday
night at 7 P. M.

Two sound pictures were shown,
the first beiag a three and one-
half reel picture entitled “The Hot-
test, Flame in the World,” a Gen-
erat Electric film. In this picture
Dr. Irving Langmuir, a chemist
who has contributed much to our
knowledge of the structure of the
‘vatom, describéd his discovery of
the hottest flame, of about 4.330
degrees Fahrenheit. Langmuir has
also calculated that if the molecules
in one cubic inch of air were each
changed into.a grain of sand the
resulting sand would fill a trench
a mile. wide and three feet deep,
reaching from New York-to San
Francisco.

The second picture of the eve-
ning, entitled “Farther, Faster, Saf-
er,” was a three reel picture ad-
vertising Pennzoil Motor Oil, First

portation, especially of the train,
automobile, and airplane. This was
followed by scenes of numerous
speed records in the making, in-
cluding the record speed for a
tractor.

FACTS ABOUT CHESTS
GIVEN BY PROFESSOR

Minneapolis, Minn. — If your
chest is flat you are probably more
intelligen than that fellow over
there whose bulging, barrel chest
interferes with the view of his feet.

At least so says Dr. S. A. Weis-
man of the University of Minnesota,
who has spent a lot of time peer-
ing and probing into the matter. He
concludes that flat-chested persons
not only average greater intelli-
gence than the full-chested, but are
taller and heavier.
