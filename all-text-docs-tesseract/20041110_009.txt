The Davidsonian

Neighborhood man caught buying alcohol for student

Recently, a scandal has surfaced

‘ concerning a member of the Davidson

community. As stated by Town of
Davidson Police Department reports,
noted sketchy guy Raymond Dobbs, 52,
was recently given a summons for pro-
viding alcohol to an underage student,
Jon Brown ’08 .

According to sources within the
Town Police, Dobbs allegedly dropped
off cooler full of beer and hard liquor
outside of Brown’s room on second
Belk on Friday night.

Brown said that the cooler and its
contents were a gift to congratulate him
on accepting his bid to the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity. “Dobbs was an SAE
when he was in college,-and he was
happy for me,” said Brown. “I don’t see
what the big deal is.” The cooler had
Brown’s name written on it in large let-
ters and a note, “I advise you to get
[expletive deleted]-faced. Your frat
brother, Ray Dobbs.”

The illicit transaction was discovered
when Ralph McClain ’06, the hall coun-
selor on second Belk, informed Campus
Safety about the cooler full of beer in
the hallway. Two officers removed the
alcohol, gave Brown an alcohol citation
and informed the Town of Davidson
Police about the incident, who then
gave Dobbs a summons at his house for

providing alcohol to a minor.

Many claimed that this was not an iso-
lated incident. Said Peter Wilton ’05 “Mr.
Dobbs was always hanging around campus
my freshman year, and while he was defi-
nitely a nice guy, he was a little sketchy.

_ When we would walk by his house on Main

Street he kept trying to get us to play Beirut
on his ping-pong table on his porch. I had to
excuse myself after he brought out the beer
bong, because it was just too awkward. The

Cees

strangest thing was that he
gave his expired license to
one of my hallmates who
looked like him so that he
could buy all the beer he
wanted himself.”

Claire Nillon ’06 agreed
that Dobbs was always
quick to provide alcohol to
underage students. “Jon
Dobbs is such a cool guy!
He would always sneak my
friends and I into the
Brickhouse and buy us all a
round of beers. And, one
time I paid him to pick me
up a handle of Aristocrat,
and he came back with a
bottle of Stoli instead. How
sick is that?”

Dobbs, a resident of
Davidson since 1994,
moved here from Durham, NC after ad-
ministrators at Duke University become
suspicious of his presence on their cam-
pus.

“He was always hanging around during
freshman orientation talking to the new
students,” said Duke Dean of Student Life
Mark Simms. “Once we started asking
him what he was doing on our campus I

think he got scared and took off and we
never heard from him again.”

Dobb’s move to Davidson received
mixed reations from some students. Bill
Goldman ’07 said, “Dobbs was pretty cool
when I first saw him hanging around the
Union. He offered me a smoke and we
talked a little. But when I started seeing
this 50-year-old guy trying to dance with
my girlfriend at SAE parties I got a little
turned off. I mean, who does he think he
is tryng to hook up with my girl.”

Dobbs’ well-known antics bothered
many of his neigbors in town as well. Ex-
plained one resident of Davidson who
asked to remain anonymous, “I have al-
ways found that man to be repugnant. He
would always be flirting with students,
and the bass from the rap music continu-
ally playing on his stereo would shake my
whole house. Trust me, we have had ru-
mors about impropriety from Mr. Dobbs,
but we would always look the other way
because he always kept his lawn clean and
took out his trash on time. Still, I thought
the College should have done something
when I heard he was found passed out in
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity on the
day of the Spring Frolics last year.”

Dobbs has a court date at the Davidson
Town Courthouse on January 23, 2005.

Young Democrat disillusioned with
Americans’ political knowledge

Young Democrat, Megan Noble ’08,
was excited about voting in her first elec-
tion last Tuesday. Her excitement dissi-
pated, however, as the night wore on,
and the election results unfolded. “I
couldn’t believe my eyes,” Noble com-
mented. “How could a majority of the
citizens actually vote for Bush?” Noble
had cast her ballot earlier in the day at
the Davidson City Hall for the Demo-
cratic candidate John Kerry. The Re-
publican and incumbent president
George W. Bush, however, was the man
who received the needed 270 electoral

_. votes to win the election and the office of

President.

All of this was, of course, to the dis-
may of Noble and her fellow Young
Democrats. Said Noble, “I was so
pumped for the election. The pre-elec-
tion polls had John Kerry up by a num-
ber of percentages. 1 thought for sure we
would be celebrating in a new, better
America by this point, but as it turned
out, we are stuck in the same crappy
America for four more years.” Noble
even questioned the decision-making
ahjlities of some who voted. “This was
the most-important election of our life-
time. I can’t believe that we had the
chance to vote an evil tyrant out of office
and install someone who could com-
pletely turn America around, but we
blew it.”

Noble even suggests she may have be-
come disillusioned with the whole
American democratic process. “If you
think about it,” she said, “it’s not very
fair at all. I researched the campaign
issues of both sides. I watched all the
debates. I watched hours upon hours of
CNN’s election coverage. I’m even in the
Intro to American Politics class. I tried
to gather all the information possible
about the candidates and the issues at
hand, in order to make my vote an in-
formed vote. However intelligent my
vote might be though, it could simply be
cancelled out by some hick on the other
side of the state who only votes along his
party line or likes Bush’s smile. How is
that fair? I feel utterly defeated.”

“While I was walking out of Chambers

the other day,” recalled Noble, “I heard
some kid talking to his friend. He asked
him, ‘who are you goingito vote for tomor-
row?’ The friend said, ‘I’m not sure, Ill
probably just flip a coin about it tonight.’
It’s people like him that allowed Bush to
sneak into office again. Why can’t people
just get it into their heads that Bush and
his policies are a cancer on this nation? If
everyone had only researched the issues
more, like I did, they would have doubt-
lessly voted for change. I mean look at the
city of Seattle, it has the highest high
school graduation rate in the country, and
its voters strongly supported Kerry. If you
look at the average IQ scores of all the
states, the top 16 all voted for Kerry while
the bottom 25 voted for Bush. It is the
ignorant voters that may have sentenced
us to another four years in the dark age.”

Noble was not alone in her sentiment
that perhaps the American voters did not
vote intelligently in the election. Young
Democrats President Jim Spicer ’05 once
had as his away message, “If Bush wins
this election, I’m moving to Canada after
I graduate.” The British liberal newspa-
per The Daily Mirror ran a headline the
day after the election titled, “How can
59,054,087 people be so DUMB?”

Noble also believed that the Davidson
students who supported Bush were not as
intelligent or informed about politics as
she. “Have you seen the results from the
Dean Rusk international awareness test?
Our class average was 59 percent! I bet
the Bush supporters were the ones who
brought down the average. If they had any
idea of what the world thinks of Bush,
then they definitely would not have voted
for him,” .

She continued, “And, did you see the
results from the political survey? I bet
every single person who did not know
how many terms a president could serve
is a Republican. And the five percent who
did not know what Dick Cheney's position
is? Well, they probably voted for Bush/
Cheney because they did not know that
guy was the Vice President! People should
really have to take one of those tests and
get a passing grade before being allowed
to vote.”
