Four years after coeducation began
at Davidson, Title IX, with evalua-
tion procedures and legal means of
counteracting discrimination, has
been put into effect.

Title IX will have several effects on
campus, according to Assistant Dean
of Students Mary Lou Dietler; the
program will serve as a guide for

evaluating coeducation, a legal means
for reporting discrimination, a tool for

increasing the community’s aware-
ness of discrimination, and an educa-
tion process.

Coeducation came into effect with
the '73-74 academic year. ‘Generally
some people were happy about it,”’
said former Union President Richard
Wassen. ‘‘We didn’t know what to
expect.”’

A few people were mad about it, -

but they were a minority. There was a
minority strongly for it, but most
students were apathetic about it,’’ he
said.

The campus has changed both
socially and educationally since wo-
men were admitted, according to
Wassen.

He thinks the men function more
securely socially without women on
campus because “‘it’s difficult to carry
on a relationship with the pressure
here. Before coeducation you didn’t
have to see the other person all the
time.”’

“We were sort of naive, thinking
women were objects to be dated on
weekends, but that has been dispro-

ven now since women are on cam-
pus,” Wassen said.

He said that the men felt pressure
to date on weekends, and ‘‘If you
didn’t have a car and money you had
yourself and that was it. Now you can
date someone here.’’

“I definitely think (the social
pattern) is more relaxed, more nat-
ural, something you don’t worry
about anymore, since the women
came,”’ he said.

The women improved the educa-
tional opportunities on campus, ac-
cording to Wassen. ‘‘I remember

.5ome of my classes; I was glad to
have women in there because they
were sharp and they added a new
viewpoint, a new dimension,”’ he said.

‘Institutional’ dorms need renovation,
future plans anticipate only ‘updating’

By PHILIP DUNCAN
Asst. News Editor

Davidson ‘College has no
plans to build a new student
housing facility. If the quality
of on-campus living is to be
upgraded, improvement of ex-
isting dormitories is the only
alternative.

“Tt seems that almost ev-
eryone has a plan for how we
should renovate the dorms,’
said Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze, Jr.

“I’m sympathetic with the
desire to get away from the
institutional look of our
dorms, but the school’s policy
does not call for any major
renovations in the future,” he
said.

Director of Student Hous-
ing Scotty Nicholls presented
her ideas for renovation to
Meetze in the late sixties. She
does not remember all the
details of her proposal now,
but recalled that ‘‘it provided
for a breaking up of the long
corridors, thereby dividing
halls into smaller blocks of
rooms. Bathrooms were to be
enlarged and a common-use
study-typing roorfi provided
for each block. The renovation
would have cut two students’
rooms from each floor, I
believe.

“Thinning out the popula-
tion in the dorms is the
essential step towards making
them a better place to live,”
she said.

“If the push for housing

“In the late sixties we made
some cosmetic changes, ‘plas-
tic surgery’, I guess you would
call it, in Watts, Cannon, and
Sentelle,’’ said Nicholls.

“We put in new furniture,
lighting fixtures, flooring,
closets, door frames and
doors, and added lounges in
each dorm.

“But I don’t think this

effort could be called anything

other than an updating. There
certainly was no major reno-
vation.”’

“There are certain human
needs that must be met,’’
commented Nicholls.

“There should be space for
students to relax outside of
their rooms. .

spacious student union, a
good-sized library and living

open Rusk House for next
year.

Last year, there weren’
enough places for the students
who wanted to join a frater-
nity or eating house and some
of the students tried to open

don’t enjoy those advantages.

“T think it’s evident that
priorities have been placed in
other areas besides housing. I
guess it’s just a matter of
where a college wants to put
its emphasis—and who con-
trols the purse-strings,’’ sta-
ted Nicholls.

Future improvements of the
dorms will follow the lines of
the sixties’ ‘‘updating”’.

Meetze says that the electri-
cal systems in the dorms are
inadequate.

“Hardly a weekend goes by
without someone calling to tell
me that their power has gone
out.

“I know that sort of thing is
against regulations, but the
fact is that students today
with their hair-dryers and
other appliances need more
power than the wiring can
provide.

“The transition will be ex-

increase the capacity of the
wiring.”

Todd is already working to
accumulate the freshman sup-
port necessary for an attempt
to open a new house. The
committee will be circulating a
petition sometime in the near
future to ascertain if the
interest is there.

Will Terry, Dean of Stu-
dents, commented on the sub-
ject, “The whole matter is in
the preliminary stages. It’s an
expensive proposition; it will
take some real commitment in
terms of the participants’ will-
ingness, to commit themselves
for at least a year. Its success
will depend upon good finan-
cial management. It will need,
I think, at least sixty people to
make it. In spite of all these
difficulties, a house like this is
badly needed in light of the
space problems at other frater-
nities and eating houses.

“One of the real questions
that the college will have to
decide will be how much
money they’ll be willing to put -
in to provide furniture and
other amenities that go into a
good social program. A good
social program is an essential
ingredient to the success of
such a house. We're not
interested in a trough.”
