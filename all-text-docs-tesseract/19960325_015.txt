Tyson

returns

By Davip MorTLock

Iron Mike Tyson is a very
scary human being. His massive
arms are scary. His huge chest is
scary. Even the gaps between his
teeth are scary. But scary human
beings are fun to watch.

Just ask the 1.4 million pay-
per-viewers who witnessed Iron
Mike’s masterful TKO of Frank
Bruno two weekends ago. In the
blink of an eye, heavyweight box-
ing is back.

Butit wasn’t the blood or the
gore that people missed during
Tyson’s absence. And it wasn’t
massive arms or huge chests,
twelve-round wars or three-round
battles. Because all these things
were always present.

People missed Mike Tyson.

They missed his flamboy-
ance, domination, and 54-second
massacres. They missed his an-
ger. Boxing fans wanted a
glimpse of Tyson, the big, bad
killing machine.

And they got what they had
hoped. Tyson danced around
Bruno, landing one vicious punch
after another. Finally, in the third
round, the referee stopped the
lopsided fight, declaring Tyson
the heavyweight champion of the
world. *

But the irony amazed me.
Even though Tyson was able to
raise his armsin the end, he wasn’t
the real winner. The real winners
were the 1.4 million people who
turned off their televisions and
Tyson until his next bout.

The flamboyance was back.
The domination was back. The
‘Jangerwas back. Iron Mike, cham-
pion killing machine, was back.
Andthatis all anyone cared about.
Earlier this year when Tyson left
prison, no one cared if he got
home safely. Everyone wanted
to know if he was going to fight
again. Everyone wanted to see
the anger again. It was all very
selfish. :

For Tyson, leaving prison
meant reenetering the life that
put him away originally. For
Iron Mike, life is a double edged
sword. He could stop fighting
and go back to the streets. Or he
could fight, make money, and
‘|continue to live an angry, unful-
filled and brutally lonely exist-
ence.

Has anyone recommended
that Tyson get a college degree?
Has anyone recommended any-
thing useful that mightlead Tyson
away from the boxing world?
Not likely.

When big, bad, and scary
Iron Mike isn’t big, bad and scary
anymore, watch and see -who
sticks around. I'll bet it's not
going to be the 1.4 million who
love to see him fight, not the
television producers, not his train-
ers, not his girlfriends, and cer-
tainly not his promoter Don King.
Who else is left?

MONDAY, MARCH 25, 1996 15:

WILDCAT ROUNDUP

Men's tennis

A slow start in doubles play
and an injury to co-captain Bill
Mitchem proved too much to
overcome, as the Wildcats fell 5-
2 to App. St.

“Tt was a dissapointing day
for the team, but as of right now
it is ancient history,” coach Jeff
Frank said.

Jon Pastel and Eric Bourn
provided the only two Wildcat
wins. “It was a tough loss,” said
Bourn, “We were in a position to
win every match, but we just
didn’t deliver.”

“Thate losing more than any-
thing,” Judson Sutherland said,
“But we have to go on. The
matches don’t get any easier, but
that’s Southern Conference ten-
nis.”

.Earlier in the week,
Davidson avenged last year’s
loss to Wofford, beating the Ter-
riers, 5-2. The most interesting
part of the match occurred when
Pastel’s crafty gamesmanship
drove Fred Jayet, Wofford’s #1
player, into unsportsmanlike
antics and a match default.

“J just wanted to play,” Pas-
tel said, “I wish we could have
finished the match.”

Women’s Tennis

Davidson bettered its record
to 8-4 this week, dispatching
Elon, 7-0, and outlasting
Winthrop, 5-4.

After beating Elon ,
Winthrop provided stiffer com-
petition, as the Wildcats dropped
two of the three doubles matches,
only to caputure four of six
singles encounters. Amber
Bradford clinched the victory
with a win at #2 singles.

Tri-captain Ashley Maner
sprained her ankle while down
3-5 in the third set of her #3
singles effort. She will hope-
fully return against Tennessee-
Chatanooga on Saturday.

“The win against Winthrop
was a milestone for the team,”
said head coach Caroline Price,
“Everyone pulled together to
come up with those four singles
victories and win it for
Davidson.”

This week, the women’s la-
crosse team spent time practic-
ing .for a tournament at
Vanderbilt next weekend.

They were expecting to play
this weekend, but Saturday’s
game against Georgetown was
cancelled due to a Georgetown
conflict.

The Wildcats (1-2) look to
perform well next weekend,
where they will face Stanford on
Saturday and Vanderbilt on Sun-
day.

Rugby

The rugby squad tasted de-
feat for the first time this season
on Saturday, falling to powerful
App. St., 27-6,

“They were bigger, stron-
ger, and faster, but we never gave
up,” said club president Thayer
Long, “We made them earn ev-
erything they got.”

penalty kicks brought the half-
time score to 10-6.

However, the Mountaineers
outquicked the Wildcat defense
down the sideline for second
period scores, as App. St. won
going away.

Davidson captain Bob
Yarborough contributed hard-
fought runs, while Chris Will-
iams and Keith Davis starred
defensively.

Women’s Track

Several school records fell
as the Women’s Track team had
a good day at the Wake Forest
Invitational in Winston-Salem
this Saturday.

The 4x100m relay team of

Roxanne Formey, Laura
Burkholder, Jamilah Sawyer, and
Venessa Sims set anew Davidson
standard with a time of 51.77,
and Sawyer also broke a record
by running a 15.4 in the 100m
hurdles to take 6th place.

“T felt pretty good about it
(her hurdles race),” Sawyer said.
“I want to get back downto where
I’m used to running in the 14’s,
but I’m improving.”

In addition, Venessa Sims
cleared 5’ 4 1/4’ in the high
jump to place Sth, and Laura
Burkholder also grabbed a Sth
place in long jump by soaring 17’
6 1/4".

“We're very supportive as a
team. We cheer for each other,
and after a race we hug each
other and say good job. We re-
ally make a point to do that, and
that’s really important,” Sawyer
continued.

-Will Bradshaw

The men’s track team has
been performing well in their
outdoor season as they gear to-
wards the conference finals on
April 19-20 at East Tenn. St. _

The team was in Winston-
Salem this weekend at the Wake
Forest Invitational.

“Overall we have made
some improvements,” Head
coach Gary Andrew said. “We
have got to start being more con-
sistent.”

The 4x400 relay team of
Dan Dearing, John Leslie, Karim
Lawrence, and Mike Albert
turned in what Andrew called
“probably the best effort of the
meet,” running a 3:31.3.

In addition, Josh Cookson
turned ina personal record 15:36
in the 5K; Tim O’ Keefe also had
apersonal record, running 10:25
fn the 3000m steeplechase.

Andrew stressed the youth
of the team as a future strength,
mentioning that most of the run-
ners (including O'Keefe,
Cookson, Dearing, Lawrence,
Albert , and Leslie) were fresh-
men or sophomores.
