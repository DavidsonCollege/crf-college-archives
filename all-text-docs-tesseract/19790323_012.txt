The chill darkness of winter
reached deep into February and
made Spring's arrival slow in
coming this‘ year. However,
with last week's beautiful

.weather, spring appears to have

In much the same way, the
Davidson baseball team had a
slow start but appears to have
finally come into its own with
victories were over Guilford
(5-0), Lenoir-Rhyne (15-12),
‘and Wingate (6-1).

The team had dropped to an
0-3 record during spring break,
losing first. to N.C. State (12-7)
and then dropping a conference
double-header to U.T. of Chat-
tanooga (12-7 and 15-11).

Despite the early losses, the
Cats did have some bright spots
such as the two home-runs hit
by catcher Bob Lapple and the
single home-run hit by right
fielder John Haskell in the
Chattanooga double-header.

In their first win of the year,

the Cats beat Guilford 5-0;
sophomore Jon Young threw
the five hit shut-out for the
Cats. The Cats led going into
the eighth inning by a narrow
1-0 margin. Then, with two men
on base, freshman Earl Ransom
came into the game as a
pinch-hitter ‘for the Cats and
knocked a two-run triple.

Junior second baseman Andy
Hosay followed with another
triple which cemented the Cats’
lead for the rest of the game.

In the 15-12 win over Lenior-
Rhyne, senior pitcher John
Madden got his first college win
by his sound hurling perform-
ance. Sophomore third baseman
Cam Zurbruegg supported

Madden's pitching by hitting
five-for-five at the plate with
three triples. Zurbruegg’s slug-
fest brought in six runs for the
Cats.

Against Wingate the Cats fell
behind 6-0 in the first inning
and dropped the first game of
the double-header 8-2. In the
second game the Cats came
alive, led by senior Ron Can-
non’s strong pitching.

Cannon allowed only four hits
in the 6-1 victory. He was
supported by the Cats’ impec-
cable defense and the strong
hitting of designated-hitter,
Rusty Colechia, who got two
hits, short-stop Jobi Merton’s
double, and senior left-fielder
Tim McDowell’s smashing
home-run.

Most recently, the Cats drop-
ped a game to West Virginia
State, moving their record to
3-5. The Cats allowed seven
runs in the first inning, mostly
due to pitching difficulties.
However, freshman pitcher
Diggs Bishop came in as a
reliever for the Cats in the first
inning with no outs and shut
West Virginia out for the next
nine innings. Though the Cats
had plenty of chances to score,
the much needed “clutch hit’’
did not come through when men
were on base. The Cats could
only muster two runs. They
finally lost 7-2.

The Cats play the powerful
UNCchapel Hill Tarheels, who
finished fourth in last year’s
NCAA playoffs on this Friday.
Though the Heels lost several
key players, they will offer
tough comptition for the Cats.
hen, on Monday, the Cats
play Southern Conference new-
comer East Tennessee State in a
home double-header.
