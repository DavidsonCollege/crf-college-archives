MACHI’S EXTEND INVITATION

(Staff photos by Davidson)

Local Machi’s will take members on non-exclusive basis.

Students Favor Unlimited
Hours By Four To One

Preliminary returns from
‘the Residence Hall Council
referendum on 24-hour open
dorms show that 80 percent
of the students voting favor
unlimited dormitory hours.
»Returns are nearly com-
plete from East, Duke, Rich-

ardson, Watts, and about
‘half of Belk dorm’s votes
have been counted, accord-

ing to RHC President Cecil
Burney.

Burney noted that almost
all of the dorm residents
have voted on the referen-
dum, which will be used to
determine which dorms will
be opened dn a 24-hour basis
if and when the faculty ap-
proves the proposal.as sent
from the Student Life Com-
mittee (SLC).

The proposal had called for
a change in the RHC Man-
ual of Order. which would
allow dorm residents to vate
themselves — round+the-clnck
open dorms.

The proposal had passed
the SLC, but the SLC felt
that it lacked final author-
ity in the matter, deferring
to the faculty. (See Mar. 6

issue of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN).

The results of the referen-
dum will be the basis of the
RHC presentation to the fac-
ulty and determine the visit-
ing hours.in the dormitories
when the amendment is pas-
sed. Y ‘

RHC contentions that the
referral of the matter to the
faculty by the Student Life
Committee was unconstitu-
tional have been dropped.

Burney said that he was
requesting that he and Tom
Opie be permitted to pre-
sent the proposal to the fac-
ulty. The presentation will
include the complete results
of the referendum and selec-
tions from the Coeducation
Commission report, he said.

The proposal has a fairly
good chance of passing the
faculty, Burney said. ‘I don’t
think this is a matter of as
much grave moral concern
as some people think it is.
It is more a case of clearing
up hypocrisies in the Code
of Responsibility and setting
up a system of student deter-
mined dormitory life.”

Bond To Deliver

Martin Lectures

Julian Bond, the outspok-
en young Black State Rep-
resentative from Georgia,
will speak on campus Mar.
31 and Apr. 1 as a Martin
Lecturer. Only 30 years old,
he was one of the first Neg-
roeés since Reconstruction to
be elected to the Georgia
House of Representatives in
1966.

Members
Elected

Freshman Mike Leathers,

tions held this week.

Steve Roady, runner-up in
the Juniog race, will fill the
vacancy created by the resig-
nation of Regulations Court
member Mike Elliott.

Dick Allison defeated Gray
Mason in a run-off for de-
fense advisor.

A total of 311 students vot-
ed.in the main election last
Tuesday, and the votes were
tabulated by the college's
1620 computer.

The Regulations Court is
composed of six students and
six faculty members. The stu-

he said that he admired the
courage of draft resisters
who burn their draft cards,

He was. refused his seat,
however, by other legislators
who objected to his antiwar
views. The Supreme Court
later overruled the decision
of._the—house—-and._allowed
Bond to take office.

Early in 1960 Bond joined
the civil rights movement as
one of the founders of the
Student Nonvialent Coordi-
nating Committee. He par
ticipated in the first sit-in
aimed at integrating Atlan-
ta’s lunch counters.

He gained a_ nationwide
reputation by leading a dis-
senting delegation from
Georgia to the national Dem-
ocratic Convention in 1968.

He seconded the nomina-
tion of Minnesota Senator
Eugene J. McCarthy for pres-
ident, and was himself nom-
inated by the Wisconsin dele-
gation for Vice President,
but declined because he was
too young to run for that
office.

When the legislature is
not in session, Bond spends
much of his time on the
lecture circuit, mostly visit-
ing colleges. He is consider-
ing running for the U. S.
House of Representatives
this fall against incumbent
white Republican Fletcher
Thompson of Atlanta.

His main. speech will be in
Love Auditorium at 8 ‘p.m.
on Tuesday, March 31. He
will also speak Wednesday
morning at 10 a.m. in the
Morrison Room in the Union.

The partial returns are as
follow: 81,43 favor unlimited
hours seven days a_ week.
11.85 percent favor unlimited
hours on weekends, with
dorms being open from noon
to midnight on weekdays,
5.59 percent favored the pre-
sent schedule, and 1.11 per-
cent preferred an even more
restricted schedule.

Results are being tabulated

on the college’s 1620 IBM
computer.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

By RUSS MERRITT
Associate Editor

After attempting for five
months ‘to create the first
successful local fraternity on
the Davidson campus, offi
cials at the Machi house, have
decided to suspend present
operations at the end of this
term for financial reasons.

Thé announcement follow-
ed closely an open board
invitation by the house to
anyone interested, making it
the first non-selective eating
club at Davidson.

Norm Hurwitz, house treas
urer, made the announce-
ment concerning the suspen-
sion of fraternity activities
to the members during lunch
Tuesday, explaining that the
present organization opera-
ting in the house would not
be able to continue its pre-
sent operations.

“At this moment the finan-
cial situation at the house is
such that it would be com-
pletely unfeasible for us to
continue as we are present-
ly operating,” Hurwitz said.

He pointed out that, al
though the house isn’t in any
immediate financial trouble,
there is a strong possibility
that it soon will be if pre-

sent. operations are contin:
ued.

However, Hurwitz’s  an-
nouncement has not been
universally accepted at the
house,

The night after his ex-

planation to the house mem-
bers that for financial rea-

sons the group would have
to suspend present activities,
several members, including
newly-elected president Wen-
dy March, welcomed those

the invitation to eat at the
house.

“T admit that I don’t know
the’ financial situation of the
house as well as Hurwitz,”
March said recently

“Norm has been the house
treasurer and trusted finan-
cial adviser for three years
and has done an outstanding
job. Therefore, we don’t
question his financial state
ments, and he has the equiv
alent of absolute control of
the purse strings

The Honors College will

at least four and possibly
six faculty members.

Any student is eligible to
apply for admission, which
will be based on the demon-

applicant, the quality and
feasibility of his personal

availability of faculty direc-

Applications may be ob-

Each student admitted to
the Honors College will be

special “contract” will be
made between him and the
faculty of the Honors Col
lege as to what his
of study will be.

Although emphasis will be
placed on individual educa-
tional. projécts, the proposal
states that “‘probably not all
of every student’s academic
work will be in the
College.”

The Faculty might specify
that certain portions of the
“contract curriculum” must
be taken in regular college

the house had no direct ef-

“Actually we'd have no fi

“However, certain mem-

Phe proposal says that
Honors College students
“may take a significant por-
tion of their work outside
Davidson College by attend-
ing another college or uni-
versity, or by working in a
research library or scientific
institute.”

The proposal envisions the
Honors College as ‘‘a cooper-
ative enterprise with cohe-
sion and unity.” Meetings of
all Honors College students
and faculty will be held per-
iodically for  self-assesment
purposes,

In addition, it is proposed

The Dean of the Honors

The proposal makes __ it

The goal of the
College ‘‘must be not only
to provide enriched éxper-
