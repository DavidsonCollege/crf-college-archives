Virtue In Vagueness?

The Academic Freedom Com-
mittee of the American Civil Liberties
Union has said:

“Regulations governing the be-
havior of students should be fully and
clearly formulated, published, and
made available to the whole academic
community. They should be reason-
able and realistic.”

Now let’s look at our rule con-
cerning the “Use of Alcoholic Bever-
ages” (and this is one rule you can’t
State too many times). In part it says:
“A student will ordinarily be svus-
pended if he is found guilty of drink-
ing, possessing or being under the in-
fluence of an alcoholic beverage . . .
while attending any off-campus event
sponsored entirely or in part by Dav-
idson College.”

On the surface it appears very
clear. . . But in fact many of the
“clear” words are open to wide inter-
pretation—interpretation that has
been subject to change.

By an “off-campus event sponsor-
ed entirely or in part by Davidson Col-
lege,” we suppose that the regulation
refers to financial sponsorship. But,
as has been pointed out, this is not
ironclad. For instance, if the faculty
Wanted to take some action against
after-parties it could conceivably do so
under this rule even though these
parties are not financially sponsored
by the college! It’s all a matter of in-
terpretation.

And what is an “off-campus
event?” We are forced to rely solely

on word-of-mouth in this matter. We
think it means all college-sponsored
trips. But what if you use your own
funds to make the trip? We think it
means that everyone who drank at
the U. Va. game violated the regula-
tion. But we don’t know.

Going into the rule further, what
does “attending any off-campus event”
precisely mean? The eight soccer play-
ers who were campused last year o
viously didn’t drink at the game. Does
this mean the trip was an event? They
“attended” a trip?

Last year it was indicated that if

a student went to a conference right

before a holiday, say in New York, and
decided to stay through the holiday,
he would violate the drinking rule if
he imbibed during that holiday. Does
this mean that those of us who went
to the parties at U. Va. after the game
are guilty? It’s a pretty hazy point...

The only sure way to clear up
some of these points would seem to
lie in the area of convictions (‘A stud-
ent will ordinarily be suspended. . . ”).
What is an ordinary case?

Last year three student leaders by-
passed any problem of interpretation
by candidly admitting to faculty mem-
bers that they had, without a doubt,
broken the rule. No action was taken.
Later the soccer team case came up
and they were campused. Extraordin-
ary?
id Is there a virtue in this vague-
ness? We can see none. The rule ob-
viously needs to be clarified, if not
overhauled.

A Change For Some

We appreciatively acknowledge
the letters which we have received
concerning religious life at Davidson
—and we hope that we have not been
misunderstood. We have never intend-
ed to belittle or obscure the opera-
tions of other individuals and com-
mittees in this area; indeed, we have
tried to assist them in their efforts
with our suggestions.

We also agree that the problem
basically rests in student apathy and
cynicism. But recognition of this fact
alone is not enough, and it often tends
to result in more apathy and cynicism.
It is unfortunate indeed that neither
editorials nor even letters will com-
pletely destroy the ubiquitous dragon

Peace Race

Sunday, November 11, was Vet-
erans’ Day, formerly known as Armis-
tice Day. It commemorates the end of
World War I, and for many years has
been the occasion for a reassertion of
the need for a repudiation of war and
a more effective movement towards
peace.

The reading of anti-war poetry
that night was such a reassertion, a
grim reminder of the monstrous ugli-
ness of war,

We need continually to remind
ourselves that nuclear war is not a
sort of trump card or ace in the hole.
It is not a solution to any of the
world’s problems. At the'end of World
War I, General MacArthur stated,
“The utter destructiveness of war now
blots out this alternative (i.e. unlimit-
ed warfare). We have had our last
chance.

“If we do now devise some great-
er and more suitable system, Arma-
geddon will be at our own door. The
problem basically is theological and
involves a spiritual recrudescence and
improvement of human character that
will synchronize with an almost
matchless advance in science, art,

of apathy. At any rate, like Sysyhus,
we at least ought to keep on trying.

We do believe, however, that an
overhauling of the college’s present
religious program in an attempt to
bring it more directly to bear on the
lives and thinking of the students
would be more likely to make a
change in some individuals’ attitudes
than a despairing continuation of the
present system.

Therefore, we continue to sup-
port of the efforts of concerned per-
sons and groups to improve the re-
ligious climate here, and continue to
hope that the result will be a turn for
the better, if not for the best. IKA

literature, and all material and cul-
tura] developments of the past 2.000
years. It must be of the spirit if we
are to save the flesh.”

Today, however, the cries against
the bestiality of war are too often
labelled “pink” or. “communist”, as
if peace itself were some sort of Red
conspiracy. We must break down
these suspicions of peace and recall
the words of the Beatitudes, “Blessed
are the peacemakers for they shall be
called the children of God.” .

Nor can we allow peace to be
equated with appeasement. Rather,
we must, as a nation, demonstrate a
positive and sincere desire for peace.

Today, we are faced with the
hard reality that arms races in the
past have always ended up in warfare,
and, secondly, that war today means
the disintegration of our nation and
society, if not of our entire species.

Let this knowledge and the honor
of the millions slain both in the past
and present spur us on in working for
an end to wars and rumors of wars
and for an increasingly active concern
for peace.

Y Conference Presents
Challenge To Coolness

BY BOB HOLLADAY

Man is estranged from his
fellow man and from his own
world. Two ideologies are divid-
ing the earth as one might rip
in half an apple with one’s bare
hands. People, -in their efforts
for other people. are sweating.
One human ‘being kicks another
human’ being in the teeth. be
cause the first hates black skin.

These are gritty, jagged, un-
yielding things we are saying
here. but they have been said
before:. they will be said again.
Of most importance to the Dav-
idson campus, they were said at
the meeting of the Southern
Area Student Council of YMCAs
held five weeks ago in Gatlin.

The concepts discussed were

ever being offered. But how
often do we accept them? How

NSA Indetinable;

Structure Changes Yearly

BY JOHN SPRATT
Student Body Vice President

It would be impossible tu
write a definitive, all-inclusive
statement about the Nationa
Student Association. The organi-
zation is many things to many
people. To be frank, it is prob
ably something less than its avid
proponents claim, yet more than
what its enemies portray.

This problem of defining NSA
is made no easier by the fact
that each year it undergoes a
rebirth. Each year the national
congress revises its policy and
installs a new slate of officers.
The temperament of the organi-
zation, like the temperament of
the delegates, is subject to an-
nual change. ~*

Several weeks ago, a DAV-
IDSONIAN editorial = stated
thet NSA had passed resolu-
tions ageinst the House Com-
mittee on Un-American Acti-
vities. What the editorial fail-
ed to mention, however, was
that the 1962 Congress of
NSA did not even formally
bring the matter of HUAC to
the floor.

This is all indicative of the
real nature of NSA. It is hard-
ly a movement to unite stud-
ents in a monolithic cause. It is
more like a forum or a clearing
house. Its political philosophy
is plastic enough to reflect the
ideas of its members in the
framework of NSA’s aspirations.

These aspirations were en-
gendered in the years following

the Second World War. Partly
in response to national student
demands, and partly in response
fo a growing international stud-
ent movement, the aspirations
in 1947 were formulated into a
constitution. °

The United States was late
in forming a national student
organization. Most European
nations had tong since pos-
sessed one. Yet, though
American students followed
the Europeans, they ultimate-
ly did not imitate their com-
mon form. NSA became a con-
federation of student bodies
and not a union of individual
students,

This, to me, is of utmost im-
portance. Had the American as-
sociation of students been a
union, of students instead of a
confederation. it. probably would
have never assumed its present
stature and probably would
never have deserved it. Under
the present system, it serves the
student community, the student
government and the student
body.

But more important, its
chances of being a body repre-
sentative of all students is much

-greater. As a union, it would

likely have migrated towards
some political pole. As a con-
federation, it can accommodate
diverse opinion. It can remain
flexible enough to serve chang-
ing attitudes. It may elude
definition, but it remains an
open forum for ideas.

our feet the very foundations of
the ways we talk to one another,
the foundations of the whys and
the hows that saturate our mo-
ments. Are these foundations
solid, or have we forgotten ex-
actly how their timbers are
joined? Representatives who
had made the USA-USSR ex-
change visit challenged us to
ensure the security of our foun-
dations by becoming fully aware
both of them and of the nature
of our opponent.

The open wound of social
injustice festers literally next
door. Men created equal are
reduced to stifled voices and
to subservience. A proposal
up for action before the na-
tional body of YM-YWCAs
suggests sponsorship of voter
registration drives and of citi-
zenship training scheols as a
Christian share in restoring to
& people its dignity. But will
any of our unfettered voices
make reply to this call?

As I said, these are gritty,
jagged, unyielding concepts. and
at the meeting I couldn't help
relating them to our own cam-
pus and to the tenuous picture
T had carried away of the David-
son Gentleman: the smooth,
sophisticated, natural-shoulder
man, so well-rounded that all
the corners which catch new

‘ideas have been smoothed away;

the man who causes his interna-
tional guests to gather in
groups of their own, because he
is apparently too disinterested
to learn from them and to help
them learn from him; the man
who squirms in his seat while
one of today’s leading political
thinkers—granted, who is no
orator—speaks his cause from
the platform. And 1 wondered

just how much these ideas
would come alive in the David-
son Gentleman's mind.

1 came to Davidson expect-
ing to be challenged by big
issues, and | expected to hear
from upperclassmen who were
vehement in their feelings to-
ward those issues. I'd read
about people on other cam-
puses doing important things;
1 thought I‘d find them here.
But | was disappointed.

And now from Gatlinburg the
YMCA brings big ideas, issues
that prompt emotions to be felt
like razors touching the raw
core of the soul. The Y plans to
move these ideas, it says.

T look at the Davidson Gentle-
man. I look at myself. And,
feeling a cold-metal kind of
hope, I wonder.

THAT ISN'T “PUNTING”,
THATS “KICKING-OFF"!

Martin Represents
. By MacDonald Galileo “Movin ely”

BY BILL TROTTER
Davidsonian Fine Arts Critic

In his first, and it is to be hoped, not his last, solo
job of directing a Vagabond production, Don Stowell
pulled a remarkable rabbit out of a somewhat shaky
hat last Wednesday night in GALILEO. From occasional
visits to the rehearsals, I had expected the worst, and
fortunately, found my expectations dashed. Brecht's
remarkable concept of the story of the famous
Reniassance scientist was done full justice.

As Galileo, D. G. Martin, Jr. acquitted himself well.
The role demands a great deal from a player, especially
in the great number of lines it involves. There was, to be
sure, roughness—dropped cues, fumbled lines, at one
time a painful dead space. But these are surface faults,
and will certainly lessen as the play takes on polish.

Brecht’s conception of Galileo is a particularly
complex one—he is shown as no Ayn Randish hero-
creator ruthlessly driving himself in pursuit of know-
ledge for its own sake; he is a weak-willed, compris-
ing genius, one who “fills his belly by using his
brains,” a prey to ego, to ambition, and most of all
to the sensual pleasure of staying alive.

His confession in the face of torture might seem
eowardly, if both Brecht and Martin did not make the
audience feel the man’s plight so deeply. Martin’s por-.
trayal is obviously deeply felt and at times, very moving.
The role calls for him to age a space of many care-filled
years without benefit of make-up; his slouching, world-
worn. Galelio of the last scenes, indeed conveys his age,

his agony.

The staging of the production (Brecht does not
indicate stage directions) was superb, thanks to
Stowell’s ideas, and Greg Govan’s adroit handling
of a part that could be clumsy. The use of slide pro-
jected on the screen was handled with taste’ and it
is a pity that the effect was almost negligible from

the audience.

The roles which support Galileo were handled well.
Tom Hamilton played several small roles with vigour;
Geoffrey Luckock was engaging and delightful in his
pair of supporting roles; John Pruitt and Bill Jacobs
played disciples of the scientist with sincerity and mean-
ing. A special word of praise to Pat Douglas, whose acting
in the part of Andrea was nothing less than hair-raising;
and to Sue Logan, as Galileo’s well-meaning, but mis- —

understanding daughter.

The play contained a lot of implications for this,
our beloved Liberal Arts college. Not the least of them
was the fact that there were five of its students in an
audience of really pathetic size. The irony, if not the
tragedy of this fact, must have made the cast wonder
what use there was in playing their hearts out. It is to

be sincerely hoped that the

students can find the time,

somehow ..., to attend a production their school can be

proud of.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Vespers

Outlook

Needs Changing

Fain

Dear Editor:

Three cheers for Joe McCut-
chen! In his letter to the editor
last. week he hit the proverbial
nail right on its well-known
head.

Davidson students have, for
some time, been protesting
against required Vespers and
Chapel on the basis of a lack of
capable speakers. They claim
that they believe in having a
meaningful and worshipful serv-
ice, that they truly want this
kind of service, but they also
claim that the caliber of these
services so far has been such
that no meaningful or worship-
ful experience can be obtained.
Who are you kidding, Davidson
students?

The problem has been stat-
ed correctly—students are not
experiencing true worship;
the fault lies in the reason for
this. Meaning can be feund
in a service in which the stud-
ents merely go and sit in

Chambers Auditorium or the
College Church for a 45-min-
ute period (no minister or
speaker present) if students
go there with that purpose in
mind. At the same time, not
even the greatest orator of
our time could transform
an_ uninterested, half-asleep
group of students into an in-
terested, worshipping group.

Perhaps Davidson's services
do not contain what is desired,
but perhaps what is desired is’
not really a worship experience.
There are many ways in which
the services can be improved
through varied speakers and
new approaches to topics, but
the best way to improve the
services is to improve the in-
dividual's outlook toward them.
It is an established fact that
what one receives from some-
thing depends on what he puts
into it.

Let’s change the outlook on
Chapel and Vespers or else find
a more valid reason for not
wanting them.

Sexy Dates,
UCLA Style

(ACP) — Remember the Life
magazine picture a few years
ago of some men at the Univer-
sity of Kentucky operating a
fake registration booth for frosh
women?

Well, a trio at Los Angeles,
California, did. The UCLA
DAILY BRUIN says the three
students set up a card table
and signs in the middie of

registration lines and estab-
lished themselves as “Station
A” for “registration of frosh
women for the campus direc-
tory.”

The trio rated each girl for
sex appeal on a one-to-ten scale
as she filled out a card calling
for her phone number and ad.
dress,

Before running out of cards
(they had 400), the three found
some who rated from One (“just
a girl, but not worth picking up
the pencil for’) to Seven (“un-
believably great’’).

Classes Eight, Nine and Ten
were purely academic, since
mo coed was found luscious
enough to merit such ratings.

The three will be generous in
sharing the cards since they ex-
pect to be overly supplied with
dates during the coming year.
