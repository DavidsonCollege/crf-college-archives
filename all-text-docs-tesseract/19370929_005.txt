The eaves on these Halls were
renewed, and the roofs patched,
completing the outside work. On
the interior, the plaster walls were
patchedg the border renewed, and
plans were made to redecorate.
Work inside the Phi Hall has been
started, with the walls being re-
papered, the wood — painted, and

new draperies put in the windows.

The largest expenditure in the
renovation program Was spent on
the laundry. The addition cost $6,
000, and the new equipment cost
more than $5,000. One new wash-
ing machine does 350 Ihs. of clothes
an hour. The old boiler was dis-
carded, and the laundry has been
connected ‘to a boiler in the main
heating. plant.

Vhe auditorium in Chambers was
also repaired, the plaster cracks be
ing fixed. Cracks in the stairway
and elsewhere were filled. Che
floors in one-third of © the class
rooms were renewed, and the rest
waxed. Also, a loud-speaker Nas
