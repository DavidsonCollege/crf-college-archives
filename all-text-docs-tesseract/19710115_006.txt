BRINGING DOWN THE GIANTS

Terry Holland breaks the news of possible suspension to several Davidson

cagers.

Harriers Set New Record
During Run From Queens

In a bizarre turn-around of
tradition the ‘(Davidson cross-
country team expressed the
dating opinion of the col-
lege by running away from
Queens last week,

Sneaking in under the cov-
er of darkness in a stolen
Volkswagen the eighteen
man team put in. a time of
five hours and twenty seven
minutes for the 24 mile
jaunt.

“It was certainly one of
the best times the team has
put in as a whole,’” rasped
Ran Coble, leader of the
pack.

The team, inspired by
their new player-coach, Ster-
ling ‘Martin, sought to ex-
pose the common idea that
the average Davidson man
is turning to other colleges
besides Queens to find his
female companionship.

“This appears to be a
common belief throughout

the local area,’’ states Mar-
tin,’’ and we wished to ex-
pose it. If people think the
typical student
away from Queens, they're
right.”

Martin went on to call

‘Coaches Elect Fogleman
SC Sportsman Of Year

(After sparking the David-
son soccer stars to 10-3-1
season and their first South-
ern Conference title, Coach
‘Harry ‘Fogleman ‘has been
named Sportsman of the
Year for the Conference.

The Sportsman of the Year

award is given three times |

yearly, to the outstanding
coach in fall, winter, or
spring athletics.

Fogleman received 39.6

percent. of the ballots cast |

by ,the coaches, winning

over such other coaches as~.

Furman's Bob King, Cita-
del’'s (Leon Crabtree, and
VIMI's Vito Ragazzo.

“T was truly thrilled and
pleased to receive this high

award. It is always stimulat-
ing for a coach to recieve :
‘such recognition from’ his

_ fellows,” Fogleman  com-

mented.

“All the members of the
soccer team feel that Coach
Fogleman deserves every-
thing he gets’ stated cap-
tain Dick Levan.

‘\Any reward I receive is
is aS much an honor to the
team as to me,’’ Fogleman
conmmented.” ‘‘Afier all, I
just; coach, while they play.’”

OPEN 9-8 —

MONDAY - SATURDAY

this run the best showing
the team has put in during
the season,

“Since we were only com-
peting against our own run-
ners, we really thought we
looked great,’’ he said.

Howard Boyd saw the pro-
test as an act of freedom of
expression,

“The cross-country team
has always’ ‘been willing to
express any opinion on a
given issue,’’ he said. ‘‘We
saw it as our duty to the
college community to give
public notice to the changes
in student opinion.’’

All did not fare well for
the team. After a quick get-
away from in front of At-
bright Dorm, the entire team
was arrested for blocking a
public street at 3 a.m. Quick-
ly confounding a Charlotte
policeman with’a string of
long words, Coble won the
right for the team to con-
tinue their jaunt, and on In-
dependence Avenue they be-
gan hitch-running toward
Davidson.

_ (Martin later discounted a
rumor that the St. Andrew's
meet held here at Davidson
was to be invalidated due to
an*ineligible runner.

“It may be. true that we
recruited another student to

‘run for us,” he said, ‘‘but

the meet need not be for-
feited because he fell at the
one mile mark and has. not
been heard from since.”’

Hub

Following -hard on_ the
heels of the probations of
six \Atlantic Coast Confer:

ence basketball stars, South- ,

ern Conference commission-
ef Lloyd Jordan has plac-
ed seven SC players on si-
milar probation, according
to sources close to the com-
missioner.

Three Davidson starters,
Eric Minkin, Steve Kirley
and Duncan Postma, are
among those frequently men-

“tioned,

One Richmond player, one
Furman star and two East
Carolina players are also in-
cluded, according to reliable
sources,

If the rumors are borne
out, the probations would
call for the ‘suspension of
the player after his next
altercation on the courts.

Jordan has publicly ex-
pressed fear that the South-
ern Conference. may be
evolving into a situation

similar to that of the Atlan-,

tic Coast Conference and has
said’ that he will not per-
mit such hostility to arise
among member schools. The
implication is that the pro-
bations are one manner of
keeping the situation under
control.

“We want to be big-time,
but this is getting scary,”
Jordan told a PTA luncheon
last Week. ‘Just last week
I saw a. guy go over some-
one’s back for a_ rebound.
That's unfair, dangerous
and unsportsmanlike. Not a
very ‘nice thing to do either.

Other possible measures
suggested as controls.on the

Three Wildcats —
‘On SC Probation

situation are the banning of
pep bands and a special con-
ference rule which would
permit the officials to eject
any coach on whom. they
have called a technical foul.

The commissioner's office
has refused to comment 6n
the probations or the alter-
nate proposals. None of the
players were available for
comment and the athletic
départments also refused to
discuss the issue.

One recent rumor has
been confirmed. Assistant
commissioner Dallas _ Shir-
ley told a press conference
called in Staunton, Va., that
VMI had used an ineligible
player in the last half of the
season,

Jordan mentioned _— that
this would not effect the
final results of the campaign
since the Keydets had not
won any of those contests.

One VMI official comment-
ed; ‘‘What’s the use, they’re
all out to gét us anyhow.”’
