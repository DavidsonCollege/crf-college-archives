Grad Students Face Draft With New Deferment Policy

By JIM COOLEY
Statf Writer.

(Second of two articles)

Davidson's Admissions Of-
fice prepares a folder each
year which would compare
favorably with many [rater-
nity rush booklets. .

One of the statistics high-
lighted is that between 70 and
75 per cent of each graduat-
ing class goes on to graduate
school.

Such a claim cannot be
made after this year, how-
ever, thanks to a memoran-
dum last month from Lt.
General Lewis B. Hershey,
director of the Selective Serv-
ice. to the nation's draft

March 8, 1968

FOR ROTC STUDENTS, TOO

boards.

The memorandum states:
“With respect to graduate
School deferments, the Na-
tional Security Council ad-
vises that it is not essential
for the maintenance of the
national health, safety and in-
terest to provide student de-
ferment for graduate study
in fields other than medicine,
dentistry and allied medical
specialties...”

It has been predicted that
next September expected
gradute enrollment of 700,000
would be cut in half.

Col. Frederick B. Outlaw,
professor of military science,
revealed that graduate defer-

ment policy for cadets in the
class of ‘68 have not been al-
tered. But members of the
class of ‘69 and following, a
new policy, based on a quota
system, has been instituted.

The Army will set a cer-
tain quota of students for
each of several’ study areas.
The deferment decision will
be made on the basis of
Graduate Record Examina-
tion scores and recommen-
dation of the PMS.

Outlaw said that a list of
study areas is being pre-
pared by the Army. It in-
cludes agriculture, forestry.
the arts, classics, biological
sciences, business, engineer-

ing. architecture, general law,
medical sciences, languages,
physical sciences and social
sciences.

Because of the Army's need
for personnel with advanced
preparation in many study
areas, he contended {it was
to the Army’s benefit to con-
tinue granting graduate de-
ferments. In case of full mo-
bilization, he continued, these
men can still be ready for
duty in a matter of weeks.

According to Outlaw, the
quotas established by the
Army under the new policy
will not be announced—only
the study areas open for de-
ferment. Students wishing de-

ferment in ‘study areas not
listed will be considered on
an individual basis.

Students must be cognizant
of the fact, Outlaw said, that
they ‘“‘will be considered on
the relative standing of the
school.”

He said Davidson's aca-
demic standard should be
favorable to the cadet, and
concluded that ‘Davidson
students will still have a very
fair opportunity to go to
graduate school.”

Though the situation is not
nearly so optimistic at the
present for non-ROTC  stu-
dents who seek deferments,

the full import of the Nation-
al Security Council’s recom-
mendations are not ail ap-
‘parent.

There is still a great deal
of uncertainty not only about
effects on graduate schools
and the entire educational
community but also about the
actual number of students
who will be drafted.

The new guidelines receiv-
ed immediate criticism from
educators across the coun-
try. Dr. Nathan Pusey, presi-
dent of Harvard University.
stated that the new policy
“would be a disaster’ and
would result in an ‘‘inordi-

nate reduction” in the num-
ber of graduate students.

Gustave O. Ailt, president
of the Council of Graduate
Schools, considered the new
policy to have no relation to
the national interest. ‘“‘The
national interest,’’ he con-
tended, “requires that we
continue to produce an ade-
quate number of highly train-
ed personnel to serve in gov-
ernment and industry.”

The Admissions Office here
will need to revise its grad-
uate school percentages, but
indications at present seem
to be that this will not nec-
essarily be a drastic revi-
sion.

A MUSICAL BILL OF GOODS
Karl Boxer Trio Entertains for Blow Up

‘Jazz Just Doesn’t Sell’...
But Boxer Plugs His Music

“Jazz just doesn't sell,”
jazz pianist Karl Boxer said,
and then proceeded to ‘sell
his audience a musical bill of
goods.

The Karl Boxer Trio pre-
sented ‘‘The Aspects of Jazz:
Talk and Performance” at
the College Union for the sec-
ond program in the Blow Up
‘68 series, sponsored by Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon.

“Jazz is not as easy to find
as people may think.”’ Boxer
said, “mainly because there
isn’t much demand for this
type of music by the public.
About the only place it can
be found today is the concert
circuit of colleges or through
records. °

In his talk Boxer traced
the history of jazz rhythms
from their beginnings tn the
classical music of the late
18th Century to the folk blues
and ballads of the early 19th
century to Dixieland.

“From New Orleans,” Box-
er noted, “jazz traveled up
the river to Chicago, where
it blended with the swing of
the Thirties to form the “Be

Out of this Leat came the
modern point and. counter
point jazz of Dave Brubeck.
This trend continued through
the mid Sixties. and from it
the recent avant garde jazz
beat developed.

“In my opinion.” Boxer
said, ‘‘jazz is headed back
toward the classics. Rhythms
and tones are beginning to
sound more and more class-~
ical. Jazz is about to make
the full cycle back to its
earliest beginnings.”

reading the approaches of
other schools like Haverford

have formulated a kind of
philosophy,"’ Kaylor said.

“Then we went through the

to see which ones we thought
needed to be revised. We
wanted to separate ‘‘house-

student parking regulations
and similar rules—from the
more substantial matter of

A REVIEW
By DIRK GALBRAITH

Adapted from an autobio
graphical novel by the Irish
author Sean O'Casey. ‘Pic-
tures in the Hallway” offers
the Davidson audience an un-
usual theatre experience and
an interesting evening's en-
tertainment tonight and to-
morrow night in Hodson Hall.

Set against the Irish strug-
gle for a national identity in
which O’Casey grew up in the
early years .of this. century.
the themes of moral ambi-
guity presented in this drama
are not merely confined to
that period of history. but
convey a sense of the beauty
and ugliness of this worid
which would arrest the atten.
tion of any audience.

The genre of this produc-
tion, the “reader's theatre,”
is a type of presentation not
lately seen on this campus.
With period costuming and
the bare essentials of the
stage, the attempt here, in
director Rupert Barber's
words, is to create “fairly
fully drawn characterizations
even though there is no stage
movement.”

It is a challenging produc-
tion, and one very well hand-
led as, relying almost solely
upon dialogue, the cast makes
the rich natural beauty of
O'Casey’s Irish dialect come
alive upon the stage.

While yet in dress rehear-
sal last night, the production
had knit together well, and in
Barber's words, “They're
ready for an audience.”

The cast. from left to right
as you will see them onstage.
includes Ellen Winkler, Joe
Gardner, Constance Welsh.

The committee: hopes to
have its work finished by the
May meeting of the College
Board of Trustees so that
they can act on it if they
choose to do so, according to
Carroll.

Along with Kaylor and Car.
roll. committee members are
Dr. A. J. McKelway, assist-
ant professor of Bible and
religion: the Rev. Will Terry,
member at large from the
college community: and stu-
dents Dave Clemmons, Tom
Clayton. Woody Faulk, Clay
Ford and Joe Murphy.

Trustees

Appointed

Trustees for the Union Ac

tivities Fund have been chos

Students Provide
Draft Counseling

A counseling service to ad-
vise students about the draft
is now being conducted by
four Davidson students and
two professors.

Seniors B. A. Aiken and
Ken Tarleton, junior John
Pancake, sophomore Cary
Tucker and Dr. Raymond
Martin, assistant professor

Tarleton said.

The counselors plan to help
registrants know their com-
plete options and to help
them meet deadlines and re-
strictions imposed by the Se-
lective Service Systems, ac-
cording to Tarleton.

David Maynard, Youth
Services Director of the

of philosophy, began their
service two weeks ago. Dr.
E. F. Patterson has been
draft counseling since Sep-
tember.

The private service is ‘‘not
just for conscientious objec-
tors—it’s open to anyone,”

The other members of the
board will be Bobby Vagt, In-
terfraternity Council repre-
' sentative: Dick Lindsey, YM-
CA: and Bil! Smyth, student
body at large. The Student
Council elected Joe Kilpat-
rick to the board last week.

One can see no serious
weakness of any kind with ‘
the Davidson Drama Depart-
ment’s treatment of O'Casey
and his Irish folk: it is a
successful presentation of a
different sort of theatre and
well worth seeing.
