PATTERSON COURT ADVISOR KURT HOLMES

By Chris Frampton
Davidsonian: There is a lot going
on right now concerning proposed
changes in the alcohol policy. We
would imagine some of that has to
be kept secret at the moment, but
could you give us insight into the
proceedings and where they stand
now?

Holmes: Well, there is very little
thatneeds to be kept quict because,
at least my hope, and I think the
whole college’s is that this whole
process will be an evaluation from
all fronts. Student Government
Association has made their recom-
_ mendations, Patterson Court is
putting together their own recom-
mendations, and I have, hopefully,
some insights that cross both lines.
I have been in-on the discussions
for Patterson Court. They’ re look-
ing to some other changes: to do
some more of their own self-regu-
lating at their parties, to do some
risk monitoring as opposed to the
alcohol monitors we have, with
several people from the chapters to
help sponsor it, and cut down on
the number of people who are in
essence intruding into their do-
main. There will be less of the
registered alcohol monitors-maybe
one, maybe two-at each party, and
to reduce the role that the police
officers have been taking. Also, a
few other things about how the
bars are operated within the houses.
I haven't heard many com-
plaints about the RLO component,
but itscems to be that, at least on
residential issues, people can live
with it because of the private na-
ture of things within the room.
Davidsonian: Has there been an
increase of people, as the SGA
phrased, “slamming” beers before
heading down to the court?
Holmes: I don’t know about the
“slamming” part, but I do know
that there is an awful lot of drink-
ing going on within the halls. I
think the policy's hope was that
drinking of that sort would be re-
sponsible, that people, if they made
the choice to drink, would do it in
a mature way. I’m sure, given
some of the incidences we’ ve had,
that there are a number of people
who are taking the option and get-
ting extremely drunk now and
keeping their “buzz” all night. I
hope it’s not as widespread as
peolpe think, butit very well could
be. ;
Davidsonian: Can you give us
some specifics of the Patterson
Court Council’ s proposal?
Holmes: ... Therisk monitors, and
taking back some of their own re-
sponsibility and ownership of par-
ties is a big part of it.
Davidsonian: What do you think
of that idea?
Holmes: Personally and in the
position I have of Patterson Court
advisor, I think it’s a great idea.
They’re also working on doing
some of their own judicial cases,
hearing the violations against the
houses, sanctioning it themselves,
and I think that’s another positive
step, where students take the re-
sponsibility for their own conduct.
It’s a lot more effective when a
peer says we think what you did

was wrong and you necd to do this
differently next time than to have
the college say it.

Davidsonian: Isn't that somewhat
of a strain on the insurance poli-
cies of both the school and the
houses?

Holmes: No, the school will still
maintain their policies, and the
Dean of Students’ office, in tum
the judicial board and honor coun-
cil, still have the right to hear any-
thing. They’re really saying we'll
give you first crack at dealing with
it. If they are doing appropriate
things and they are giving out ap-
propriate sanctions or responding
in areasonable way then they won’t
lose their right to do that.
Davidsonian: So, in essence, the
idea is to give the court a second
chance to monitor itsclf?

Holmes: Well, I think what hap-
pened was that the students had the
opportunity, under the previous
policy, tomonitor themselves. The
school said that this whole policy,
the students: judicial boards, the
PCC, and the houses themselves,
wasn’t working. So they defined a
new policy for this year where the
rule of judicator is taken back by
the school and now under this new
policy, they may be given achance
to monitor themselves. So, yes,
there is a sense that it is a totally
new ballgameand the school wants
to sec how the court operates under
the new rules.

Back to the PCC recommen-
dations. They have listed four pri-
mary areas. Basically, define the
role of the alcohol monitor, they’d
like to use them more as risk moni-
tors than alcohol monitors, by re-
ducing the number ofalcohol moni-
tors they believe responsible par-
lies will be more attainable, parties
that won’t get ourof control. They
don’t want the monitors chasing
down underage drinkers.

And I think the school would
agrce with that. We don’t want
them out there hunting for people,
but to be making sure things don’t
out of control. Clearly, because of
state law,and our need to enforce
that, part of thcir role must be
monitoring underage drinking.

The PCC wants to reinstate
the two monitor rule for all houses,
they will have to have two sober
monitors per each house. The
school will provide one monitor
who will back those people up in
their job. I guess the real reason to
keep anyone, from that perspec-
tive, is that limits both parties’
liability. The school has a pres-
ence there and that student moni-
tor would cite the house if the
house wasn’tholding up its end, so
that any risk management prob-
lems, from the house’s perspec-
tive, can be backed up by saying
“‘we must be following the rules or
the school would be coming down
onus.” So its kind of a balance, or
at least that is the hope. And, the
PCC’s other big concern is their
belief that some of the outside po-
lice officers have not worked with
college students and are used to
bars as opposed to what a court
party is like. They don’t have the

experience of dealing with the stu-

dents. When an officer from
Huntersville or wherever comes
into that situation they will see a
drunk person stumbling out the
front door as a threat where as our
own officers sce a student. They
are, therefore, looking to redefine
the police role, to get away from
some of the antagonism.
Davidsonian: Do you think, look-
ing at the incident at KA, that the
animosity between students and
police officers is a direct result of
the new policy?

Holmes: I think police end up
catching the brunt of students’ frus-
tration with the whole policy. There
was some real ambiguity at the
beginning of the year, clearly there
is still some ambiguity now. That
leads to some frustration because
you can’t work in or around or
through a policy if youdon’tknow
what it is. I have always main-
tained that college students will
find a way to work with any policy.
If you think they’re creative in
class, they are even more so in the
other areas of their lives, and I
think they just wanted a full set of
rules and to work with it. We
didn’ thave that set when the school
year started. We’re better at it
now, but that frustration level gets
thrown in the faces of the police
because they are the ones at the
parties. They’re on the front lines.
They’re visible there, and let’s face
it, there in badge, gun, handcuffs.
There a visible sign of authority.
Davidsonian: What about the other
aspects of your job? Patterson
Court Advisor doesn’ t mean Alco-
hol on Patterson Court Advisor.
Holmes: Well, it depends on the
time of the year, because alcohol
takes up about ninety percent of
my time,

Davidsonian: Can you give us an
update on SAE?

Holmes: They have set up, as far
as I know, several committees to
work on their reinstatement on the.
court. One of the large areas that
they have asked for my help on is
the redefintion of their pledge pro-
gram, because that was one of the
large reasons they were removed.
They’re hoping to correct those
problems. They’ve set up acom-
mittee of two students from each
current class to work with me to.
redefine how they do their pledge
program. PCC has also set up a
committce to define what their
expectations are of SAE when they
return, and the college is also re-
viewing it thorugh the CCRL.
Davidosnian: So it is pretty cer-
tain they will return?

Holmes: From the beginning it
was assumed they would return if
something didn’t go wrong. There
was an outline of what they needed
to do. I would probably guess that
they are a little behind schedule
because they are only now begin-
ning toaggressively figure out what
they’re doing. They’ve also taken
on a new set of officers recently,
and I think that new set of officers
is going to pursue their reinstate-
ment. It’s by no means certain, but
if they do everything they are re-
quired to, they will return.
Davidsonian: Along the lines of

problems with pledging, what
about the situation with Sigma Phi

. Epsilon?

Holmes: Atthis point, there isa lot
Ican’t talk about. There has been
a review committee, the number
one at KA, Rod Carter, and Julie
Petty, the president of thé BCC,

John Eaves from the Dean of Stu-

dents office, and Alex Pinkston, a
theatre professor. I kind of chaired
the group, not actually voting on
their decisions, but guided them in
getting people in there and making
some recommendations of what
some possible alternatives were.
They have made areccomendation
as of [last Thursday] to Dean Terry
and Dr. Kuykendall. It may be
conceived by some as punitive but
I would define the whole thing as
educational. There are some areas
that include restrictions on the
chapter, but there are areas that
mean to improve what the chapter
does. I also don’t think that they
are an anonomaly. The whole court
has some problems. We handed
outsome guidelines, some of which
were referred to last week in the
Davidsonian, on pledging. Those
are going to be changed for next
year; a few things added, some
thing redefined with how they are
described, because road trips
weren't specifically mentioned.
We need todo that. We need to say
specifically, “These are not al-
lowed, these area bad thing.” There
is some potential for some real
hardship there. Some other things
that have come to light, almost to
people making a case for why Sig
Eps actions weren’t that bad.
People have talked about things
that their chapters and other chap-
ters do and were finding out that
there is a lot of personal servitude
out there. Nothing major, but hav-
ing someone clean your room or
do your laundry. It’s nothing that
is long term damaging, butitssome-
thing that shouldn’t be in a pledge
program. So the outcome of this, I
think, is going to be, perceived by
some as punitive, but I hope it’s
educational.

Probably since I have an op-
portunity to make a plug for the
good sides of what has happened
here, should mention it. The Sig
Ep national has acted very respon-

sibly. They stepped right in, were -

willing to help, the local chapter
was willing to help, clearly that is
a big difference from what hap-
pened with SAE last year. If their
national had been a lot more in-
volved that would have been a
different situation. So it’s kind of
a model for how you should re-
spond when bad things happen.
Davidsonian: Can you give us an
ideal pledging program?
Holmes: I think a pledging pro-
gram, and all the chapters seem to
have this at heart, as atime for new
members to learn about the organi-
zation. In the case of our fraterni-
ties, there is an awful lot of na-
tional history, regional history, that
goes beyond just the local chapter.
It should be a time to learn the
people, to learn the history, and to
learn what goes on in the chapter.
Toooften what itbecomesisatime

for people to do a lot of stupid
things. There is a place for that
fun, a place for that just screwing
around. Imean you’ reat acollege,
not forced into a Ph.D. Program.
You’reatan undergraduate school,
you should have some fun, or
you’ve missed out on a lot. But
when it becomes organized sepa-
ration betwecn groups you have a
problem. The real guideline that |
give to students if they ask, is if
you have to ask, don’t do it. But
beyond that, anything that sepa-
ratcs the two groups and makes
one group subject to humiliation
orundue work, then you’ vecrossed
the line. This is the situation with
road trips. Even though it’s a fun
game, there is a potential for harm
and it separates the two groups
against cach other. I’m much hap-
pier when an organization runs
some things like IMAC events or
even scts up tug of war, with broth-
ers working with pledges, so forth.
Davidsonian: What about the ex-
pectedrise in the popularity of 88
fights?

Holmes: We’ve sent out a letter
reminding chapters that they will
be penalized severly for vandal-
ism. Egg fightsare sortofa strange
exception. If it's people who have
chosen to be involved, two groups
who have agreed to entangle with
eachother, as vileas some students
think the outcome might be, then I
think it is OK. As long as they
clean up. If they were shooting
water balloons in an organized
competition, no one would ques-
tion it. The problem really is,
when does it cross the line and
become vandalism: when people’s
cars are hit, when the houses’ win-
dows are broken? If we could find
a way that those things didn’t hap-
pen, almost organizing an egg fight
on a Saturday. But then you run
into the danger of losing the spon- -
tancity. Ireally don’thave a strong
stand against the egg fights, and I
know the college hasn’t taken one
either. They have said, “you need
to clean it up,” and the house will
probably sce.some bills if they
haven’t cleaned it up. . .
Davidsonian: Pledging is on hold
right now?

Holmes: At this point, because of
some vandalism we had Thursday
evening that was pretty major. The
first inlcination was to say that the
two houses that were flooded did it
toeach other. Thehousesare claim-
ing that neither house was respon-
sible and that it was probably a
third party. Dean Terry has said
it's at least three houses involved;
we don't need this to continue.
We’ ve instructed the houses with-
Out suspending social events, to
say hold your pledge programs
because a lot of this is from one
pledge class to another or house to
another, and until the parties re-
sponsible for flooding those two
houses step forward and say, yeah,
we did it. The physical plant is
understandably angry. I think we
will hear about this by Monday or
Tuesday.
