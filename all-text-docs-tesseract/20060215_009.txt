Q: Good to hear,
Helpy. What
does a typical
day in the life of
the ITS Help-
Bot consist of?
A: When~ my
microprocessor
first turns on, I run
a basic diagnostic
scan of my core
systems. Next, I
proceed to scan my
secondary
sequences and
external devices.
Finally, I have a
hot cup of Java
script.

Q: Can you tell
us about your
worst day on the
job?

A: Once a human tried to insert a virus-
laden floppy disc into my drive. Luckily, I
had the updated versions of Norton Anti-
Virus and SmartEnforcer running to count-
er the threat. I subsequently upgraded my
floppy disc drive to a DVD-ROM and
shocked the human with my MAC-I stun
baton hardware upgrade.

Q: What do you do with your free
time?

Civilization,

most students are
receptive to get-
ting computing
help from a robot
instead of a
human?

A: The answer to this
question is irrele-

my presence is agree-
able to them. It is in
my programming.

Q: But don’t you
think students
would rather
speak to a person
about their prob-
lems rather than
getting a pre-pro-

response from a
robot?

A: Like every ITS

Timothy Clark ’07 decided last spring that
it was time he took a break from the intense
Davidson workload. During the fall semester
he enrolled in the Davidson sponsored
“Semester in Prison” program.

Dean Rusk developed the program for
students who want-
ed to experience a
different culture for
a semester without
leaving the country.
Last fall was the
inaugural trip, but
due to _ positive
reviews from the
participants it is
likely to become an
annual trip.

“My parents did-
n’t want me to do ae:
the typical abroad | as
trip because they |
were worried about

attacks and_ the
spread of bird flu,”

looked to be a great
compromise:  get-
ting to experience a
different culture
without all the dan-
gers of a foreign

country.”
Clark, and Six the “Semester in Prison”
other classmates,

were accepted into the program and spent
the fall semester studying in the
Mecklenburg County Municipal Detention
Center. They received four credits including
one that could count towards the multi-cul-
tural core requirement.

“There was a mandatory time for exercise in
the yard, showering, eating, and stamping
license plates, but other than those times,
we had free time during which I could study.
It was quite relaxing.”

“I'd say that overall I was much less
stressed out during
my semester in
prison than a typical
Davidson semester,”
agreed Clark. “I did-
n't have to visit the
local Counseling
Center once.”

Gregory also
found it to be a
rewarding academic
experience.

“Most people say
that the time you
spend experiencing
a different culture

results in easier
school work and
more partying,”

stated Gregory. “But
I found it to be the
opposite. If I didn’t
get my school books
off the book cart that
was pushed around
every day and begin
furiously studying
them, I would have
gone insane.”

Students did not
think it was a perfect
trip, however. Some had ideas for changes
in the future.

“I had a problem at the beginning of the
semester with my original roommate,” said
Gregory. “She kept swearing all the time and
offering me cigarettes to

“Tt was a very unique
and rewarding experi-
ence,” said Clark.
“Sometimes growing up
in upper-middle class
America, we forget what
it’s like to live some-
where else. The
‘Semester in Prison’
program allowed us to
experience a different
lifestyle: the prison
lifestyle.”

Most students found
the new environment
less stressful than
Davidson.

“You weren't involved
with a billion different extra-curricular
activities at once,” said Leslie Gregory ’07.

compromise: getting
to experience a dif-

ferent culture without

explain everything I’d
learned at ‘The Great

last year, but she didn’t
seem to care.”

Clark also had one
complaint from the trip.

“The only thing I did-
n't like,” said Clark,
“was the food. Most stu-
dents come back from
their experiences study-
ing away from Davidson
and claim that the food
was excellent. In my
experience, however,
they served the same
mush everyday. At least it was better than
Commons, though.” t
