‘CAT CHAT

By Lacy McLean

What had promise of turning in-
to one of Davidsons few undefeated
varsity teams, lost claim to fame
in that division Monday night when
the wrestlers, crippled by the “loss.
of Browning to the army and Cop-
pedge with an injury lost to Virginia
Tect 21-9

The set-back, which came in the
form of a mild upset, will not, how-
affect the status which the

ever,

groaners enjoy in North Carolina

circles—that of a dula contender

for the State championship. The
deciding match will be a setoo held
in Davidson on February 21, with
both the varsity and fresh teams

meeting Carolina.

OLE SOUTHERN CUSTOM

A note commending Davidson on
her hospitality and friendship ex-
tended to the visiting Albemarle
High school basketball team came
to Coach Chet Chapman last week,
and the credit should in part be
passed on to the student body. In
Coach DeLettos own words, “treat-
unent—of-this kind can do more for
you than all the publicity money
can buy,” and he’s certainly right.
This is one way in which the stu-
dent body as a whole can do its
part in getting athletes to North
Mecklenburg—show them a good

time when they come visiting.

THE GRIDIRON AGAIN
Monday began an arduous six
weeks for not only the Davidson,
but most of the other Big Five
griders—spring practice. A rather
large crop of frosh up from the
bumper crop of last fall are on
hand in enough volume to keep
things moving at top speed all the
time.

The loss of fourteen seniors,
many of them veterans who have
been holding down key positions
for three years, will undoubtedly
hurt, but next fall the Cats may be
ready to move. Army registration
may treat us favorably and it hardly
seems possible that any football
team could run into the same luck
two years in a row which the Cats
suffered last fall. There is, as yet no
definite confirmation of the team,
Ga. Tech, or otherwise, who will
fill the date left vacant by Sewanee’s
cancelation of her schedule.

President Cunningham, in approv-

Coach McEver is glad of the col-

Though not trying to compete with
the large universities that have
many more resources, Davidson is
attempting to get a fair share’ of
