Davidson club sports grow recaaty

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Staff Writer

Club sports are an integral
part of student life on most
college campuses, especially
those which have limited bud-
gets for the athletic depart-
ment.

Davidson does not have the

sizeable athletic budget of.

larger schools. The college has
also seen an increase of inter-
ests in a wider variety of
sports over the last few years.

But the athletic department
cannot finance squads in every
sport which possesses student

equipment, referees and lining
the field results in extremely
high team dues.

Unlike many other schools,
Davidson’s club teams will
receive aid in the form of either
direct grants or equipment.

Dr. Chip Stone, Director of
phi Education, is assist-

interest. As a result, club os

teams are often formed.

In theory club sports are
student-run, student-funded
organizations, making them
totally independent of the
school’s athletic department.

On the Davidson campus,

there are club sports in foot-

ball, rugby, ice hockey, lac-
rosse, soccer, women’s field
hockey and sailing, as well as
an outing club.

There is, however, a present
controversy concerning whe-
ther or not the athletic depart-
ment should finance club
sports, and, if so, to what
extent.

This question is especially
important in such.sports as
club football, where the cost of

STONE

ing in the organization of club
sports this year. He hopes to
keep the clubs essentially ind-
ependent of Davidson’s reg-
ular sports program.

‘‘We try to provide some
funds. But since it is a
student-run organization, we
try.to stay out of the coaching
and administrative aspects of
the program,” Stone pointed

t. “Club sports have a place
ie college and I think we
should do everything we can
to help them up to a point.
When we start infringing upon
their creativity and money
raising campaigns, we should
get out.”

In the case of club football,
the team receives aid in the
form of used equipment. Often
there is a shortage of equip-
ment and the gear may not be
of top quality.

Junior Tim Sellars, who
coaches the club football team,
believes that without adminis-
trative support the team
would have a difficult time
supporting itself.

‘Tf we can’t get the safe
equipment we need to suit
people out and get them to
play, then these people are
going to get disillusioned and
not want to play,’’Sellars ex-
plained. ‘‘If this happens over
a series of years, the team will
start missing games and other
schools will not want to sche-
dule us. It’s a vicious circle.”

It is Stone’s belief, however,
that a majority of the schools
let their club teams bear all the
cost themselves. When the
Davidson athletic department
helps financially, they are
taking a middle of the road
approach to the problem.

‘‘We feel that club sports
are valuable and we don’t feel
they should bear all the
costs,’ he said. ‘‘Therefore,

we do provide some grants,
fields and equipment.”

Sellars is not sure though
that the athletic department
could not do more to assist the

club sports program.

‘““Maybe some people are of
the opinion that club sports
should be funded by the
students,” Sellars explained.
“Whether or not that is really
feasible is questionable. I
think the values of the club
programs far outweigh the
costs of maybe a small outlay
from the administration.”

The budget for club sports
will not be decided until each
team has submitted a list of
expenditures to Athletic Dir-
ector Thom Cartmill.

He, along with the other
members of the department,
will then determine how much
money will be allocated to each
club.

In the past the club football
team has received as much as
$500 a year. One year they
received $4500 worth of equip-
ment.

But with the growing num-
ber of club sports those figures
will probably be cut.

Despite the financial ques-
tions, the athletic department
encourages the organization of
new club programs and will
attempt to assist in its organi-
zation.

If a group decides to form a
team, they should find a
sponsor, uSually one of the
coaches who has an interest in
that particular sport, and
present their ideas to the
administration.

“Certainly there are prob-
lems,” observed Stone. “But
club sports are valuable. We
recognize we don’t have all the
facilities we need. But still we
encourage any group of people
with an interest in a sport to
form a club team.”

Booters drop two,
Beat The Citadel

The Davidson College soc-
cer team had its record drop to
1-9-1 losing games to Furman
and Belmont Abbey. The two
disappointing losses came on
the heels of the Cat’s only
victory and their worst defeat
of the season.

The Cats travelled to the
Citadel and knocked them off,
2-1. Tommy Blackwood and
Dave Patton did the scoring
for the Cats. On the following
Wednesday, Appalachian
State came in and destroyed
Davidson. The Mountaineers
dominated the game, winning
easily by a score of 4-0.

Blackwood shines for soccer squad

To the accompaniment of
oohs and aahs from the crowd,
Tommy Blackwood weaves his
way upfield,

He is as quick as a cat, and
his feet can maintain incred-
ible control of a soccer ball. As
the best player on the David-
son team, he gets quite a bit of
attention from the opposition.

“Tf the Southern Conference
coaches know about anyone,
they know about Tommy,
commented teammate Joe
Duncan. Indeed they must
since he was named to the

All-Conterence team even
though he played in no confer-
ence games.

Talent-wise, Blackwood is
definitely above average, but
it is his knowledge of the game
that really sets him apart.

‘Tommy knows soccer so
well,’’ commented a team-
mate, ‘‘that he doesn’t have to
think about what he does like
the rest of us.”

‘“‘Tommy didn’t become a
really good player until late in
his high school career, and
he’s still improving,’’ said
soccer coach Chip Stone.

‘He is a very quick shooter,

but up until this year he never
really had the hard shot.”

‘‘But as quickly as he can
get a shot off,” noted a player,
‘the doesn’t need to kick it
hard. It just gives him another
weapon.”’

Blackwood said, ‘‘My
strength is my passing game.
Everyone else usually says it’s
their scoring or speed, so I’ll
say it’s my passing game.”’

Not that Blackwood lacks
either of the other skills. In his
Davidson career, he has 15
goals and 18 assists. ‘‘With
the ball, Tommy is as fast as
anyone,”’ added Stone.

Blackwood has definite pro
ambitions. ‘‘I know I can play
professional soccer,” he said.
“It’s just a matter of being
noticed and getting drafted.”’

Stone agrees. ‘‘There is no
doubt that he is good enough.
But with our record he prob-
ably won’t get the recognition
he deserves.”

Blackwood was:selected as a
pre-season All-American, but
Stone discounted its value.

“In college soccer, being an
All-American does hot mean
that much. Being selected to

team travelled to Furman and
lost a heartbreaker, 3-2.

“We played very poorly,”’
Wildcat player Phil Barringer
commented. ‘‘It seemed like
we were not up for the game.”’

Blackwood put the Cats on
the board first as he knocked
in a pass from Paul Parker.

The Paladins tied it up,
scoring from the midst of a
crowd in front of the Davidson
goal. But the Cats raced back
into the lead by 2-1 at the half,
as Parker headed in a corner
kick.

Early in the second half,
Furman again tied the game
on a defensive blunder by the
Cats. Fullback Chuck Fiden
tried to get the ball to goalie
Bob Perz to clear, but kicked
it poorly, allowing a Paladin to
intercept and score.

The game was decided in the
last few minutes when a

' scramble following a Furman

indirect kick resulted in a goal
for the Paladins.

“We played a very sloppy
game,” said one player. “We
were just too disorganized.
There is no way we sould have
lost to Furman.”

On Tuesday the Cats enter-
tained Belmont Abbey and
dropped a 4-3 decision. Again
Davidson jumped off to a
quick lead, scoring on a direct
kick by*Barringer from about
20 yards to the left of the goal.

“I was trying to cross the
ball for a possible head,’’ said
