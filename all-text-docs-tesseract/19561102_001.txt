JUDGE OF THE COURT OF CONTROL Reitzel Snider looks
on as revenge-minded freshmen clinch a close 29-27 win over the
ovtmanned sophomores in the annual Freshman-Sophomore Day
last Monday. With the victory, the Court closed its books for the
year as the frosh discarded their beanies and trampled the grass
with abandon.

Frosh Win Annual Event
Monday, Emerge Hatless

The Freshman Class earned the right to shed their red
beanies by virtue of their 29-27 victory over the sophomores
in the annual Freshman-Sophomore Field Day Monday after-

noon.

The frosh put the contest on ice
with a decisive triumph in the tug
of war event. The 15-man fresh-
man tug of war team took the first
two of a 2 out of 3 series and were
awarded 5 points to clinch their

win.
FLICKER BALL

Consequently there was little
enthusiasm in the final event, the
flickerball yame, which the sophs
won 27-0.

The sophomores copped the 50-
yard dash with Melvin Jones and
Paul Frierson taking first and
third places, respectively. Al Mac-
Kay, a freshman, finished second.

The freshmen responded with a
clean sweep in the sack race. Butch
Farabow, Tommy Price, and Newt
Quantz finished first, second, and
third, in that order.

Quantz and Price then teamed up

to win the three-legged race, fol-,
lowed by sophomores Manfred .

G. P. GUNN RESIGNS
AS FILM PRODUCER
IN SURPRISE MOVE

In a surprise move last Saturday

morning George P. Gunn resigned
j his duties as producer-director of
the “Banners of Freedom” series
in a mutual agreement with of-
ficials of the Protestant Radio and
Television Center of Atlanta.

According to Dr. Ernest J.
Arnold, vice-president of the
;Center, Gunn's policies for shoot-
‘ing the “Davidson Story” conflict-
ed with those of the Center.

Bill Lipton. the professional actor
and announcer. from Greenwich.
Conn,, who was slated to star in
the lead role. will, in all probabili-
ty, not be retained.

However, Dr. Arnold, speaking
for the Center, emphasized that
the Center is “more anxious than
ever to present the Davidson Story
to America and the world.”

USE MORE STUDENTS

“As far as we're concerned,”
Arnold continued, “this is only a
temporary delay. Some _— script
changes are necessary. Casting will
remain the same except for pos-
sibly more use of Davidson stu-
dents.”

The announcement by the Center
of. a new producer-director to suc-
eced Gunn is expected to be forth-
coming within the next few days.
‘Shots taken on the campus by
Gunn last weekend will still def-
initely be used.

Mr. Wilson's faults.

ONE DRAWBACK

“One should try to see the
whole man,” Dr. Link said. “His
contributions are outstanding, but
he had one drawback that plagued
him throughout his life.

“Wilson was always able to pro-
ject his ideas, but not himself. The
people felt no great love for him
as a man,. but they had tremen-
dous confidence in his ideals and
standards.”

These ideals and standards are

FOURTH ANNUAL

Freshman Council Plans
Parents’ Day Program

Nearly 80 freshmen are anticipating visits from their pa-
rents this weekend in response to the invitation extended by

Davidson College to the fourth annual Freshman Parents’ Day.

A varied program, designed to
introduce and familiarize parents
with Davidson, has been planned
by the Freshman Council.

Parents arriving Friday will re-
ceive complimentary tickets to the
Friday night’s Artist Series per-

Registration period Is from 9

an informal tour of the campus
by members of the Student Coun-

his undertaking.

' The exhaustive study of Wilson
grew out of Dr. Link's dissertation
on the Democratic campaign of
1910-1912. Beginning in 1944, he
worked steadily in research for
five years. From 1949 to 1951 his

Innovations Highlight
‘Rainmaker’ Showing

Performances of “The Rain
maker,” November 16-17, mark the
end of nearly a month of intensi-
fied planning and rehearsing by
the cast and stage crews.

According to its director Harold
Hall, “The Rainmaker” will be one
of the most unique productions to
be given within recent years by the
Red and Black Masquers. Several
new innovations should highlight
the-local performances of this well-
known play.

The stage is divided into a three-
set area, such as is often the case
in larger playhouses. The multiple
sets call for an intricate handling
of lighting effects which the direc-
tor has pointed out should heighten
the effectiveness of the perform-
ance,

NEW SETS

Also of interest are the entirely
new sets which have recently been
(purchased by the Masquers at a
considerable expense. The organi-
zation feels that these should aid
greatly in contributing to a good
presentation.

Director Hall, who along with
Professor Raymond Tyson is hand-
ling all phases of the rehearsals,
stresses that this will be a stylistic
play in which the characters are
especially endeavoring to create a
duplication of the midwestern at-
mosphere which is its setting.

THE CAST

The cast of seven includes only
two people who have appeared in
former productions by the Red and
Black Masquers. Harry Paschall
and George Kemmerer, who will
be familiar to Davidson audiences,
take two of the predominate roles.

Outstanding individuals in the
total production are Bill Pfeffer-
korn, who plays the lead role,
‘Carol Sherrill, the lone female per-
former, who has the role of Lizzie,
and Hugh Craig, designer of the
new sets and the director of the
i stage crews.

work was intermittent, since other
duties occupied his time.
SECOND FOLLOWS
The second volume of the fruits
of this research and study is forth-

coming. Dr. Link plans five more.

volumes to compiete the work.
“After the seventh volume, if I
have enough life left, I'll go back
and write on the early period of
his life.” he injected. The present
study begins in 1902.

Dwelling upon Mr. Wilson's edu-
cational contributions. Dr. Link re-
marked. “The people looked to him
as an educational leader just as

was a great leader in both fields,
although it would be difficult to

much as a political one. And _

compare his achievements in these |

different spheres of endeavor.
WILSON’S DRIVE

“Through his drive and standards
he turned an indifferent and lazy |
college into the first-class Prince-
ton we know today.

“His influence in educational
methods is far flung. The honors ;
program here at Davidson is but
one example of this. His interest
was in quality education, not in
mass production.”

As a personal insight, Dr. Link
mentioned Wilson's personality
drawback in relation to his work
at Princeton. “At. first he had a
loyal group of followers. but as the
years wore. on his overbearing na
ture cost his much.

were a tragic example of his lack

The dedication in his heart pours

in conversation. he seems to gain a'
joy from fassing the results of his

The question of segregation in!

ing Wilson's administration drew |!
the following comments from Dr. !
Link.

RACE QUESTION

“The race question was not
sharply defined during Wilson's
time. Segregation as an issue did
not approach its present status.
True, the NAACP organized in
1909, but it was not primarily a
Negro organization. It was run by
a group of social justice workers
and was a definite minority.

“Mr. Wilson believed in a_ bi-
racial. system, but with equal rights
for each race. For a southerner.
he took what was.a liberal position
at that time. The segregation in
the bureaus drew reaction from
mostly northern Negroes.

“Tlowever, this was a blot on his
political record and he realized it.

| At the close of his second term he

had reduced this segregation great-
ly.”

The multi-school survey was

Davidsonian. Results will be pub-

campuses.

The States Rights Party polled
2.2% of the vote, the Independent
ticket, 14° and other candidates
received 5°: of the total vote.

North Carolina, usually Demo-

Nixon team by 58.5°: of the state’s
popular vote on the collegiate
level.

Three N. C. colleges maintained
the traditional Democrat majority:
Louisburg College. Woman's Col-

College. The Independent and
