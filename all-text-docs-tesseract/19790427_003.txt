girl. “I was much more explicit
and gave the full nature of the
incidents,"’ she said.

However, neither town nor
campus police have any record
of the call, being received.

When asked about this dis-
crepancy, the second girl em-
phatically said, ‘I did make a
call saying that we had been
molested.”

Both girls agreed their calls
to security were met with ‘‘non-
chalance,”’ especially the second
call. .

Hughes said he hoped that in
the future, ‘Students will be
more detailed in describing their
complaints. We were not aware
that the incidents had a sexual
nature until today (Thursday).”’

Kent St. memorial group
split by resignations

Kent, OH (CPS)—The May 4
Task Force, the Kent State
University student group that
oversees the annual memorial
programs for the deaths of four
students in 1970, has been split
by the resignation of seven
members. The seven claim the
Task Force has been diverted
from its original ‘educational
orientation” to “obscure politi-

cal pufposes.”’

Specifically, the resignees—
who. included co-chair Mike
Sorohan— protested that Task
Force meetings were ‘‘undemo-
cratic,’’ and that it had included

One speaker—Charles
Thomas of the National Arch-

from this May’s memorial in
support of the resignation.

In a letter explaining the ~
resignations, the seven said the

terized by ‘‘gross’’ human
rights violations. It said the
speaker represented the Task
Force's ‘‘politicization."’

Student senate threatened with dissolution

AUBURN, AL (CPS)—Over 80

percent of the voting students
at Auburn University approved
a non-binding measure on the
April 13 campus ballot that
would make the student gov-
ernment subject to dissolution
every year.

Court is to make a recommen-
dation to the College President
and Dean of Students on the
new social natures of the two
houses. According to Ratliff,
two national fraternities are
interested in reestablishing
chapters that they once had at
Davidson, and there is consi-
derable demand for another
women’s eating house. Ratliff
added that, ‘‘Co-ed houses are a
possibility if demand is shown.”’

Ratliff also stated that it has
been suggested to give the two
houses to the off-campus frater-
nities, Sigma Phi Epsilon and
Phi Gamma Delta, but he
discounted the possibility of
either’s returning to Patterson
Court.

Ratliff said that the subcom-
mittee, “Does not want to make

Commons

The measure, sponsored by
losing presidential candidate
Jim Purcell, would have stu-
dents vote whether to continue
the student government at least
once a year. The measure,
however, has no legal force.

Purcell originally presented

a recommendation without in-
put from many students, so
that it can consider a wide range
of opinions.”

The subcommittee is, how-
ever, fairly diverse. Ratliff is a
member of Phi Delta Theta, and
the other members are Laura
Michael, a member of Rusk,
Jim Tholen, a member of Phi
Gamma Delta,
Gardner, a drama professor.

Ratliff stressed that the sub-
committee’s recommendation
will be best received by the
College administration if it
clearly represents student de-
sires for the future of the
Patterson Court social system.
Ratliff has therefore been ac-
tively soliciting students’ opin-
ions and wants students to
express their ideas'on the new
houses’ roles by contacting the
subcommittee members.

the proposal in January as a
constitutional amendment, but
the Student Senate said it was
‘improperly drawn.’’ Purcell
then discovered that there were
no guidelines for ‘‘properly”’
drawing up an amendment, and
the resultant student pressure
forced the government to put
the measure -on the ballot, if
only as a non-binding opinion
poll.

Purcell says he will submit a
new proposal to the Student
Senate, probably later this
month. The measure, if passed,
would be binding.

The junior said the contin-
uing threat of dissolution would
‘‘put some fire under SGA
officials to do something for
students.’’ He said because so
few students vote in the elec-
tions, the government “‘isn’t
really representative of the en-
tire student body.”

The Auburn vote came less
than a week after students at
the University of Georgia voted
to dissolve their student gov-
ernment. Over the last twelve
months, student governments
at the University of Texas-
Austin and at the University of
Northern Colorado also have
disbanded.

Attrition will affect housing

Reassurance is at hand for
the 120 freshmen who thought
they were without a room for

(Continued from page 1)

Board members, hall counselors, and
participants in several varsity sports.

When Sigma Phi Epsilon moved off
campus, ‘‘we never wanted to lose our
strong national ties, which kept us toge-
ther,’’ reported president Billy Taylor; ‘‘for
we have more pledges and brothers than
ever before, based on our work to improve
relations with the campus community.

“We have twenty initiates this year and
over forty-five brothers, which is double’”’
the figures of three years ago, Taylor said.
As for a parallel to the national trend,

“having a fraternity-owned house where
brothers live is a big advantage.”

A few years ago, the Sig Ep’s sported
T-shirts that read ‘‘Obnoxious in victory,
bitter in defeat.’ Taylor does not believe
the obnoxious label still applies. ‘‘That
attitude kept us together during the move
off-campus and angered many people, but
we've made a conscious effort to alleviate
that."

Adrian Wilson, president of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, does not see any relation between
activities within the SAE house and current

nationwide movements. When asked whe-
ther there was any parallel, Wilson said
‘*not necessarily, because we've always
been strong and strive to maintain our
strength.”

While many people at Davidson label
SAE as prep school oriented, Wilson
admits that though ‘‘we do have a preppy
faction, it is not dominant. Too much of one
faction leads to stagnation, so we try to
attract various elements, and we've been
very successful.”

The SAE’s point to extreme diversity as
a major advantage, In the past three years,
they have had three football team captains,
and over a third of the house has competed
in inter-collegiate athletics; aside from
athletics, there has been an SGA president
and over a dozen’ SGA senators, with an
equal number of hall counselors.

They boast a Union Board president and
members, The Davidsonian staffers, a
Watson Fellow, and last year, two members
of Phi Beta Kappa.

Wilson believes that his house has a great
sense of pride in its. national affiliation. ‘‘I

hope the trustees will realize that there is a

sad

positive resurgence taking place here and
will reinstate the bid system,’’ he ex-
plained.

George Brown, president of Kappa
Alpha, reports that ‘“‘most KA’s are not
excited about national membership,” but
rather take great pride in being a Davidson
KA.

As proof, Brown told of nine members
selected for Phi Beta Kappa this year.
Almost half the SGA consists of KA’s
including the president.

Over ninety percent of the house’ com-
petes in intramurals, according to KA
senior Bill Anderson.

Membership in the national fraternity
compares well to the movement sweeping
America. ‘“‘Three years ago, only twelve
seniors were national members. Now there
are thirty members in each class,” said

‘Brown.

Even though the Davidson KA’s retain

themes like “Qld South Weekend’’, Brown >

next year. At the moment the
number without rooms from all
classes has fallen to 68 men and
10 women.

According to Housing Direc-
tor Scotty Nicholls, § situa-_
tion is quite*normal afid the
college always succeeds in plac-
ing all those students who want
housing.

“Natural attrition takes care_
of the problem between April
and September,” Nicholls said.

She is already aware of four
or five people who will not be
back in the fall to occupy their
rooms. Usually some other peo-
ple decide to leave or go abroad .
at the last minute, Nicholls
said.

Nicholls also explained that
there is still plenty of housing in
town to be filled. A list of rooms

available is. pinned on the
bulletin board outside Nicholls’
office. :

Seniors also frequently decide
to move off campus later in the

year, leaving rooms in the
dorms to be filled by sopho-

mores, Said Nicholls.

Nicholls likened the college’s
policy.to that of hotel overbook-
ing. She 4dded that if Davidson
did net overbook, it. would have
_fewer students than it has room
for in the fall.
