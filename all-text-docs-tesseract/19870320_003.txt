Friday, March 20, 1987 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Suspected rapist escorted off campus twice

By JIM DILLON f

Myron Holler, wanted for
questioning regarding a rape and
murder case, was seen on David-
son’s campus twice late last term,
following several girls and enter-
ing unlocked doors in dor-
" mitories.

Holler was caught in Cor-
nelius on March 6 and was
charged. Although he was wanted
in Iredeli County for questioning,
his previous record contains only
four traffic violations.

Jackie Hughes of the Public
Safety Office said Holler was re-

ported on campus twice. Both
times he was escorted off the cam-
pus. Hughes said had they known
that Holler entered unlocked
rooms, officers would have
charged him with first degree
burglary. However, those viola-
tions had not been reported at the
time. Officers did not know that
he was wanted because: Holler
used a false name. Holler appar-
ently told police and students he
enountered that his name was
Doug Johnson.

According to campus police,
Holler was seen on campus twice

and reportedly entered both
matories. Following the ‘scare
with Holler on campus, signs
went up all over campus, and all

. hall counselors and resident advis-

ers were advised to warn people of
the possiblity of his return. The ar-
rest in Cornelius was a result of an
identification from those signs,
Hughes said.

“We got a lot of calls after the
signs went up, but they usually
ended up being pizza boys,”
Hughes said.

Resident adviser Dave Archer
pus more often than the police
know about or were able to catch
him. When Archer saw Holler ina
hallway one evening, he sent

someone to call the police. Mean-

while, Archer detained Holler in
his room until the police could ar-
rive.

Tom Jennings of the Resi-
dence Life Office said the only
role that office played in the event
was communication with the
Dean of Students office and the
campus police, and to advise

Keck gives address for Sesquicentennial

By NELLE McCORKLE

Yale Divinity School Dean
Leander E. Keck on Thursday ad-
dressed the opening sesquicenten-
nial convocation, which com-
memorated Davidson’s first day
of classes on March 12, 1837.
Keck, who was presented_an hon-
orary degree by President
Kuykendall, spoke on “Academe
and Steeple: Shared Vocation.”

Keck said church-related
higher education must maintain a.
strong sense of continuity in de-
fining the religious meaning of
education, in maintaining wide
accessibility, and in stressing the
need for precise role definition.

This second unchanging as-
pect of church-related education
incorporates tension between
‘quality and equality, Keck said.
He noted the difficulty of allocat-
ing scarce funds: “By and large,
the churches have neglected the

colleges they founded and have
left them to find their own re- .
sources. But colleges like David-
son, which succeeded in finding
resources, were able to provide

‘quality education. Some of the

poorest college education is pro-

vided by church-related and so- __

called Christian colleges because

they are too impoverished to do
better and too tenacious to die.”

Keck praised Davidson’s fi-
nancial aid program for compen-
sating for this narrow, shifting ac-
cess. He examined historical evi-
dence that Davidson did not al-
ways need to overcome finan-
cially limited accessibility. “A
century ago, going to Davidson
cost less than half of going to the
state university; today it costs
more_than twice as much,” Keck
claimed. .

In analyzing the current role of
church-related colleges, Keck:
asked whether such colleges

would be able.in future years to re-
main in existence, if such colleges
could be Christian without being
constraining, and if individuals at-
tending those institutions could
learn personal and public integ-
rity.

Keck answered each of these
three questions affirmatively.
However, he noted, ‘“‘The ‘yes’ is
itself an act of faith, a reliance on
what is deemed to be utterly reli-
able in the midst of mounting am-
biguity.” A needed approach to
learning accompanies this faith,
Keck said. “Throughout the
humanities, students acquire the
hermeneutic of suspicion, accord-
ing to which everything is to be
questioned because nothing is
what it seems to be — and
rightly — but rarely also acquire
a hermeneutic of affirmation,” he
said.

Keck charged Davidson to

transmit value and culture. He
said, “It was faith which created
this college and sustained it for fif-
teen decades. It is faith that will
take it forward into the future we
cannot portray but for which we
can prepare by being faithful

stewards today of what has been

put into our hands.”

Three alumni also received
honorary degrees at the Convoca-
tion: James M. Robinson °45,
who is Director of the Claremont
Graduate Schoo! Institute for An-
tiquity and Christianity; J. Ran-
dolph Taylor, who is President of
San Francisco Theological Semi-
nary; and Dan O. Via °49, who is
Professor of New Testament at
Duke University.

Approximately 1000 people
attended convocation, including
85 seniors, according to Director
of Institutional Research Rick
Love. Assistant to the President
‘Melissa Jones said, “The student

people about the possiblity of Hol-

Jennings said little can be
done to prevent this type event
from occuring again without stu-

_dent help. “I think we just need to

‘educate our residents, especially
women, about locking their doors
and about who they give the com-
binations to their dorms to,” Jen-.
nings said. “Someone must have
obviously given that guy the com-
bination, or he just waited until
somebody ‘else went in, and he
went in behind them. They should
really be careful about that.”

attendance tended to reflect en-
rollment in 1837, and since the
spring awards convocation on
April 24 focuses on student
achievements, I hope more stu-
dents will come and be a part of
the college’s 150-year history.

Sesquicentennial Coordinator
Rupert Barber said of the convo-
Cation, “It was the culmination of
a great deal of work by a great
many people. There were a
number of students who were very
much involved with the planning,
who worked well, who volun-
teered a lot of time, and we are
very appreciative of their help in
having the whole thing come off. I
regret that more students did not
feel the importance of this event
and hope that in subsequent events
there will be increased participa-
tion as together the college com-
munity celebrates this milestone
this year.”
