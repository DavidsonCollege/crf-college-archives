IMAC Report

tl

BB&H examine lower forms of life

By BAD BERNARD

The definite lack of note:
worthy accomplishments by
this week’s flickerballers have
forced us to try to create
something readable for this
column outside the realm of
regular reporting.

CLOSING in for the kill, Steve Porter prepares to put the tag on Rob Payne.

Club Sports

After considerable thought,
we decided that it was about
time that somebody finally
said something about the little
men (and women) of this illus-
trious IMAC sport. Therefore,
in their honor, Bernie and
Hogman have devised our
bottom ten flickerball teams
for this year.

We realize of course that the

honor and prestige of our top
ten far outstrips the titillating
effects of being in our bottom
ten, but nonetheless, we feel
that these teams and players
merit our attention.

Bottom Ten:
1. Pika—Rarely in flickerball
history has a frat team placed
such an awesome display. of

Football club stomps Wake;

ruggers smash Red Springs

By KEVIN ROBBINS

It was the Presbys over the
Baptists again in an epic
battle last weekend as the
Cats Football Club romped
and stomped over a sleepwalk-
ing Wake Forest team on
Sunday.

The Dreamin’ Deacons had
their lights putrout as the Cats
Clubbers lit them up for a 12-0
blanking.

‘Davidson controlled the
game early and presented
numerous scoring opportuni-
ties, but their best break came
when the devastating defense

fractured the wrist of Wake’s
QB. The Deacs’ punch rather
broke down simultaneously.

Ron Rosenberg, Club
Sports honcho and worthy of
getting his name in the paper,
was set up for a TD burst from
the five by a long pass play.

Steadfast teamwork, the
key to Sunday’s victory, re-
sulted in a second TD follow-
ing a long scoring drive.

The Football Clubbers, now
1-1, play UNC-W here on
Sunday at 2 pm.

Wake will continue to won-
der what the field looks like
inside the 20-yard line. Sweet

dreams.

In the smartest move yet
made by the Rugby Club, the
Rugged Ruggers did not play
last weekend in order to
prepare their minds and livers
for’a big Homecoming bash
with Red Springs Rugby Club
this Sunday at 2 pm.

The Ruggers cordially invite
all family and friends who
wish to join in the plastering,
bothSduring the game and at
the party immediately after-
wards.

Hope everyone has a great
Homecoming even if you don’t
get clubbed.

HOMECOMING WITH

CELEBRATE

outstandingly poor flickerball
talent on the field. The Pikes
sealed the first place position
when they obtained the dub-

ious honor of being shut out
(34-0) by the ATO’s for the

first time in history.

2. Steel Raisins—This fresh-
man team received fifteen of a
possible two first place votes
after a typically lethargic per-
formance against the Whizz
Kids (64-0). What is excep-
tionally noteworthy about
that game is that the Raisins
allowed the Kids to success-
fully convert a PAT kick by
boomer Rob Murray.

3. Ruskeller—This high. a
rating should be expected for a
first year’s women’s team. The
WADS are short on flickerball
talent, long on charm and
should stick to having beer
and pizza parties.

4. Sons of SOMF — Another
freshman team which almost
took our #1 spot were it not for
their 12-7 victory over Pika
this week. Team is still look-
ing for their first first down of
the season.

5. EMBO—Like all great
Embo teams of the past, this
year’s team amazed flickerball
fanatics by their inability to
show up for games. The first
team to forfeit twice (and lose
its $10 deposit), Embo is
assured of its twentieth conse-
cutive’ losing season.

6. Wedding Party —This coed
team showed. an awesome
display. of. offense when they
gained eight total yards in

their game against M&M this”

week. This team only reflects
the abilities of its two coaches
(Badham and Clark) and
would probably have difficulty
beating Pika.

7. PAX— What can you say
about a team which has t'wo
girls and a dog that looks like
an overgrown rat playing for
it?

8. Tampa Bay—John Mc-
Kay's troops seemed to be
overly concerned about last
week’s 38-6 loss to second
Cannon but hope to establish
themselves soon as a legiti-
mate flickerball franchise.

9. PDT #1— Unlike past Delt
teams, this one seems to be
headed for our number one
spot, like a bat out of hell. We
should have had some idea of
the Delt turnaround when this
team struggled to beat the
Steel Prunes.

10. Bargain Basement —The
only team in the history of
IMAC to go from our top ten
to our bottom ten. Congra-
tulations, Bill and John.

This week’s Top Ten:

1. KA #1

2. SAE

3. MacFleet and Stuff
4. Bongs

5. Fupped Duck

6. JC and the East Harlem
Whizz Kids

7. War Kiwis

8. FIJI’s

9. Old Men

10. KA #2

Notable Quotables:

Jonathan Washburn, Pika
player on how to beat his
team: ‘‘Show up at game
time.”

Sion Boney, on pre-game
team prayers by the Bongs:
“We'd do it ‘xcept that most
of our guys are already on eye
level with the man upstairs.”

Jeff Clark, on coaching a
girls’ team: ‘‘I really enjoy the
challenge of trying to teach
girls how to score.”

Graeme Thompson, on be-
ing IMAC President: ‘Hell,
this job is a piece of'cake. You
wouldn’t imagine the things I
can get with the equipment
room key.”

The lack of newsworthy
flickerball action has exhaus-
ted our supply of humorous
jingles. Later. °
