Shopping center corrupts Davidson life

By MARK DUCKETT
Staff Correspondent

Soon our peaceful existence
will be changed. The moral
foundations of our characters
will be undermined. The fine
fabric of our lives will be rent
assunder. A new shopping cen-
ter is opening in Davidson.

What may appear to some tc
be the best thing in Davidson
since the new head shop is in
reality a treacherous force
which will rob us of our inno-
cence and dignity. We have
courted a demon, a viper, to
come into our midst. She will
subtly seduce us further and
further down the winding path
to our destruction until we

reach the point of no return.

Then we will no longer be able
to return to the lives we once
led. We will have been corrup-
ted by a two bit streetwalker.

Garish neon lights screaming
DISCOUNT will catch. our
eye—then our bodies will fol-
low. Into the pit we'll go by
droves like lemmings into the
sea. Soon we will have forsaken

all the ideals of small town life’

to worship at the altar of
capitalism.

Our once peaceful routine will
be transformed into an endless
series of outings to the K-Mart,
Burger-Doodle, and Jeans
store. Our children will drop out
of school to loiter aimlessly on

_the sidewalks of our new mis-

tress begging for quarters to
feed the gluttonous pinball
machines. We’ll waste gallons
upon gallons of gas burning up
the highways in our futile
attempts to buy a bargain at
the new discount store. Yes,
Davidson has fallen prey to

modern day commercialism.
First.a small shopping center,
then’a motel, bowling alley,
laundromat, cinema, roller
rink... the list is endless. David-
son, once the bastion of an
almost forgotten way of life, is
on its way to becoming just like
every other town in America.
What will happen to the down-
town area? Will it become just
another inner city slum as
people gravitate to the suburbs?
Will the crime rate soar? Will
women and children be crushed
by reckless drivers trying to get
to the stores before they close?

How can we sit idly by and
watch the Davidson-Cornelius
metroplex area become just
another Mooresville? It is in-
deed a grave tragedy that in the
name of progress we willingly
sacrifice our individuality.

Look at the: people

Over Christmas break I took
the train several times to near-
by Chicago. In the South, most
people are used to cities that are

growing. Chicago is a city that

has grown.

I'd made the trip so many
times before. I'd sat and stared
like all the others, mute and
blind. It was a special blind-
ness, not human or physical, an
uppermiddleclass suburban
sightlessness that could have
seen, but would rather not right
now, thank you. Perhaps I had
grown immune from overexpo-
sure? No. I never really cared in
the first place.

Ghettos, garbage, the urban
ugliness all totalled into one
giant nothing. It didn’t exist.
Reflections in the window suc-
cessfully obscured the outer
reality, recreating: in light the
impenetrable mental wall.
Throughout the incessant train-
clack stopandgo, my eyes re-
mained vacant like the lots
which called to deaf ears as I
passed above it all.

The commuter train is really
quite a clever arrangement.
When you're three stories up,
everything is removed and un-
real. The scenery passes like the
image on a forgotten screen, the
TV left on during dinner. I’d
taken the train many times, and
it had rarely failed to bore me.
Then, after all those hundred
dry runs, I took my first trip.

I slid my twodimesanda-
quarter under the grate to the
radioblared cashier, who pushed
the appropriate button. After
passing through the uninter-
ested turnstyle, I bounded up
the stairs to the platform tc
wait. The train pulled itself in. I
got on. I sought anonymity. in
the usual place, the window, as
I always did, as everyone

always did, but. instead of
looking, I saw. | fea 2

The empty dooryards, tn
filled and glass mn,
up to me and the broken bottles
were cutting my bare feet. The
burnedout hulks ‘stood ike for-
gotten questionmarks, punctu-
ating no question in particular,
merely asking. The sunlight
shone as it had to, and reflected
off the roofs and splintered
windshields of the junkyard
cars and the rows and rows of
shiny bumpers, _

Blank windows, hollow eyes
with their crooked yellowed
shades parenthesized by tat-
tered cloth, peered back at me,
dried and tearless: And other
windows, windows broken like
the hearts that are stomped to
death or left to rot on the
cracked and treeless pavement,
stared silent and accusing.

The forgotten mainstreets of
faded neon and tattered second-
hand-coat-suffering, laid out in
precise and ironic squares, led
nowhere. Distance and speed
tried to obscure the reality. I
felt drawn out, compelled to
examine and see, but out there I
could only be the ugly tourist
with fifty cents for a picture of
the friendly natives.

The towering brick monu-
ments marched by, the urban
renewal zoos with barred bal-
conies so that the animals
wouldn’t escape. They couldn’t
fall, or jump. People live there.
The people who silently got on
or off at every. stop along the
way live somewhere out there.
The cracked and shadeless
lamps or dying plants perched
in the listless’ windows are
owned by friends and fathers
and families.

I don’t plan to ride the train
much, anymore. It’s too depres-
sing. People live there:
