Davidson's only Sunday afternoon at- |
traction for college students, presents it- |
self in the form of “The Gullies,” lo-|
cated one and a half miles northeast of
the College.

“The Gullies,” caused by erosion ap-
proximately a century ago, consist of a
numberless group of cuts, thirty to forty
Jeet in depth, terminating in a low, broad,
open valley of sand. A pine grove sur-
rounds a major portion of these chasms,
but they were exterminated from the
gullies by winter rains. |

This Sunday amusement center is com-
posed of a formation of loose, smooth
surfaces of clay that gradually slope in-
to a rounded bottom of sand which be-
gins other ascensions. The smooth clay
affords ample opportunity for
sliding and climbing, frequently partici-

pated in by athleticly-clad students.

“The Gullies” have proven so popular
as a Sunday evening attraction that ap-
proximately 50 per cent of the Davidson
College Student Body have visited them.

gram, the great composer, J. S. Bach. Its
sympathetic melody and expressive ren-
dition made it outstanding.

The last two numbers were choruses by
the glee club. The first of these, “Ye
Watchers and ye Holy Ones”, dates back
to the seventeenth century, and is in
chant form. The latter, Mozart's Gloria,
from his Twelfth Mass, is known wher-
ever high class. sacred music is sung.
Its brilliance and praise were well inter-
preted by the glee club. Piano and or-
gan accompaniments were used with these
choral selections.

Dr. Moffett, pastor of the jlocal Pres-
byterian church pronounced the bene-
diction, after which the glee club sang
the Dresden Amens.

blocking of Corbin and Hutchins’ for 40
yards. After two line thrusts yielded
a first down, Mackorell went over from
the 1 yard line to score within two min-
utes after the opening kickoff. Pittman
went in to kick and dropped the ball
neatly between the posts to make the
score 7-0,

After an exchange of punts the Wild-
cats started another drive which ended
when Wingfield ran around end for 25
yards and fumbled, V. M. I. recovering.
Urick quick kicked» over Wingfield’s

successive first downs they drove to the

of the ling,for the Cadets’ first score. His
placement for extra point was blocked.

Again there was an exchange of punts,
giving Davidson the ball in mid-field. A
perfectly executed lateral from Wing-
field to Mackorell netted 33 yards. After
an ineffectual try at the line, Mackorell
heaved a long pass to Morgan, in the
end zone for the second tally. Pittman’s
try for conversion went wide.

As soon as they regained possession
of the ball, the Wildcats started another
drive which resulted in a score when
Mackorell threw a pass to Windham, who
ran the remaining distance for a touch-
down. Pittman kicked the point and the
half ended a few minutes later with the
score 20-6.

Twice during the third period David-
son went deep into enemy territory but
was prevented from scoring when Clark
intercepted two passes. Then taking the
ball on their own 35-yard line the Ca-
dets made two first downs and ended up
with a spectacular forward lateral pass,

Davidson, to J. P. Irwin, a prominent
young business man from Alabama. The
couple lived in Charlotte, where they ac-
quired considerable property and par-
ticipated actively iy the affairs of that
section.

Delighted at this opportunity to see
her sister again, Anna made careful
preparations for her trip to Lexington,

A few days after her arrival, her host
gave a reception for her and it was on
this occasion that she met and fell in
love with General\—{Stonewall” Jack-
son, Who was then a Major.

After the marriage of Isabelle and
Harriet, Anna, .the third daughter, took
her place as principal helper in the fam-
ily. Although she and Eugenia made
their social debut together, they were
not as congenial as Anna and Isabelle.
She, nevertheless, adored Eugenia, her
younger sister, who was the most beauti-
ful of them all. Anna, on Eugenia’s
marriage to Mr. Rufus Barringer, later
a General in the Confederate army, took
great pride in preparing her sister for
her bridal ceremtony.

After her famous husband's death, Mrs.
Jackson made her home in Charlotte for
the remainder of her life.

The marriage of Anna left only two
of the Morrison daughters, Susan; the
musician of the family, and Laura, who
was very gifted in painting. ° However,
love soon attracted both, and Susan was
married to Alphonse Avery of Mor-
ganton, who afterwards distinguished
himself as a Major and a Judge of the
Supreme Court.

After Eugenia’s marriage, Dr. Mor-
rison resigned the presidency of David-
