Defense dominates as Cats improve to 4-2

By BRIAN MAYERHOFER
Sports Editor

With so many important starters
returning this season, the Davidson de-
fense was expected to be solid. Awe-
some, not ‘solid, is the only word to
describe their performance so far. After .

Saturday’s ac-
“tion, the Cats
defense
ranked 3rd
nationally in
team total de-
fense as they
have yielded
an average of only 240.5 yards a game.
They currently rank 2nd in team scor-
ing defense as opponents are averaging
only 11.5 points a contest. Only West-
ern Illinois, allowing 9.7 points a game,
are better than the Cats in Division I-
AA. Senior safety Cliff Henry and
junior cornerback Donnie Johnson head
up an outstanding secondary which leads
the nation with 15 interceptions.
Johnson, with five interceptions, is tied
for the national lead. In turn, the
defense’s strong performance has al-
lowed the offense to often start with

excellent field position.

Before this season, the offense
switched to a new formation. At first,
there was some concern on how suc-
cessful it would be. After a shaky start,
the offense has also proved to be very
potent. Senior quarterback Tommy
Dugan is also among Division I-AA
leaders as he ranks 21st in points per
game.. The result of such a balance
resulted in two dominating perfor-
mances over the past two weeks.

In the first contest, Davidson beat
up on archrival Washington& Lee, 29-
7. The Cats piled up 247 net rushing
yards against the.Generals. Davidson
was led by Tommy Dugan who rushed
for 68 yards on 16 carries. Senior Brian
Kern added 50 more yards on just six
carries. Freshman Ryan Pagan contin-
ued to impress as he averaged 9.7 yards
per attempt. On the passing end, Dugan
completed 8 of 19 passes for 11 lyards
and one touchdown.

After being forced to punt on their
first two series in the first quarter, Cliff
Henry made the first big play of the
game. Henry made a diving intercep-
tion on third down deep in the Generals
own territory. Three plays and fifty

seconds later, the Cats were up 7-0. The
big play came on first and ten from the
W&L 27. Dugan handed the ball off to
Kern who took it all the way to the 9.
Eric Ferguson then carried twice, scor-
ing from the 2 on second and goal.
Against Washington & Lee,

Davidson’s special teams continued to ©

excel. After Dugan put the Cats up by
13 with an impressive 12 yard run, the
Cats lined up for what looked like a
typical extra point. Instead the ball was
snapped to Dugan, who ran it in for a
two-point conversion. Inthe third qurter,
the special teams were at it again as
senior Wes Jones broke through the line
to block a punt by the Generals. The
ball was deflected to senior defensive
end Ben Spivey who ran the ball all the
way to the W&L 23.

Up 15-0, and having such good
field position, the Cats were set for the
kill. After the Generals held the Cats to
one yard, Dugan, unable to find an open
receiver, was able to run sixteen yards
for an other Davidson first down. Two
plays later, Dugan scored his second
touchdown of the game. In the fourth
quarter, Dugan threw a great pass to
Roland Williams, who split the defend-

ers, and scored. The play went 27
yards, and the Cats were up 29-7. Wil-
liams had a good game as he had three
catches for 48 yards. '

On the defensive end, both Bo
Henderson and Freeman Belser contin-
ued their excellent sophomore cam-
paigns. Both had twelve tackles.
Henderson was especially impressive
as he had two sacks. Linebackers Wes
Thornton and Sam Fraundorf also
played well as they had seven tackles
apiece. One last note, during the game,
senior kicker Brian Langley set a new

Davidson record as he connected on his ;

36th consecutive extra point.
Davidson used a very balanced
offensive attack to defeat Methodist
26-0. Once again, all cylinders were
clicking as offense, defense, and spe-
cial teams all clicked. Dugan had one of
his best days passing going 14-of-25 for
142 yards. Dugan added 43 rushing
yards. Brian Kernhad his second strong
game in a row as he carried the ball six
times for 56 yards. Eric Ferguson added
64 yards as he continues to climb up
Davidson’s all-time rushing chart. _
The highlight of the game was

The Davidson Men’s and
Women’s Swimming and Diving Team
traveled to William and Mary College
this past weekend to take on the host
team as well as Virginia Tech. in the
Wildcats’ first meet of the season. In a
meet that centered mainly around the
in-state rivalry between William & Mary .
and VTI, Davidson was unfortunately
relegated to the role of “third wheel.”
However, despite the fact the ‘Cats lost
the meet overall, several Davidson
swimmers and divers enjoyed solid per-
formances.

Against Virginia Tech. the

Women’s soccer victory ends winless streak

By ALISON KALETT

The Lady Wildcats’ 3 -0 win over
Southern Conference Chattanooga on
Sunday was a key confidence booster
as Davidson looks ahead to the South-
ern Conference Tournament which be-
gins on November 3rd. Prior to the
game Davidson (6-10. 4-3) was in'the
midst of a five game losing streak dat-
ing back to their 2-0 loss to the Univer-
sity of Richmond on October 3rd. .

For the first 70 minutes of play,
Chattanooga play was not reflective of
their 1 and 15 overall record and their 0
and 7 conference standing. The Lady
Mocs held Davidson scoreless until the
7ist minute when junior Ginny Dye
scored on a give and go assisted by
fellow junior Leila Wormuth. The goal
was Dye’s fourth of the season and 19th
of her career.

28 seconds later it was deja vu-

women’s team lost by a score of 175
points to 77 points; however, individual
standouts included Freshman Starr
Daniell of Lithonia, Ga. who took first
place in the 200 meter butterfly. Also,
junior Beth Wilson earned 2nd place in
the 200 meter breast stroke with a time
of 2:32.86, while senior Captain
Kathleen Paffenroth took second place
in the 200 meter butterfly. Despite
these solid performances, Virginia Tech
was still able to pull out a victory due
largely to their dominating perfor-
mances in both the 200 and 500 meter
freestyle events where they swept Ist
through 3rd places, Also included in the’
point totals are the diving events. Wild-
cat divers, sophomore Christa Conner

scored the goal off a give and go by
Dye. It was Wormuth’s second score of
- the season.
The Wildcats had managed to build

under 30 seconds, but '

and freshman Elizabeth Nugent, fin-
ished 3rd and 6th respectively in the
one-meter events.

The men’s team fell to Virginia
Tech by nearly an identical score as the
women, 169.5 to 71.5. Aid, like the
women’s team, had several solid indi-
vidual showings but were unable to
triumph as a team. The ‘Cats 400 meter
medley relay, swum by junior Terry
Dolch, sophomore Kurt Hirsekorn, jun-
ior Scott Harper, and senior Bill Pater-
son, took first place. Also, Hirsekorn,
sophomore Matt West, and freshman
Tom Murphy led the Wildcats ina 1,2,3
sweep of the 200 meter breaststroke,

schedule did not get
any easier. Against
powerhouse Clemson
University (10-3) the
Wildcats were once
again set packing with
a lopsided loss. Al-
though the ‘Cats were
able to contain the Ti-
gers for over 20 minutes, Clemson even-
tually broke the game open with goals

than Virginia Tech, falling by a 32 point

margin. First place finishers included
Starr Daniell in the 200 meter butterfly,
freshman Heidi Hester in the 500 meter
freestyle, and Elizabeth Nugent in the
one-meter diving event. Other solid
performers included Hester who also
took second in the 1000 meter freestyle
and 200 meter freestyle, freshman
Kendra Berner who earned second place
in the 100 meter freestyle, and diver
Christa Conner who finished second in
one-meter diving.

The men’s team didn’t fare as well
against William and Mary, losing by
over 70 points. Yet despite the team
loss, junior Scott Harper won the 200
meter individual medley with a time of

another special teams play. With the
Cats up 14-0 late in the first, Davidson:
lined up for a 38 yard field goal.
Davidson’s line was set up to the far
left. Only Dugan, Langley, Kern, and
Ferguson were in their normal spots.
The ball was pitched to Dugan who
pitched it to Kern. Kern followed
Ferguson’s block and ran 24 yards for
the score.

Davidson’s defense continued to
excell. For the second straight game,
Cliff Henry picked off two passes.
Donnie Johnson also had two, tying
him for the Division I-AA lead. Senior
Rich Hale also had a pick as the Cats
took the national lead in interceptions.
Henry’s first pick was especially cru-
cial as he gave the Cats great field
position on the Methodist 39. Four
plays later, Nate Hagerman scored his
first touchdown of the year. After tak-
ing a 20-0 lead by the end of the first
quarter, the Cats cruised to a 26-0 vic-
tory. They outgained the Monarchs 347
yards to 227.

ing at Richardson Field. Game time is
