Completion schedule for new dorms still uncertain

By TRIPP HELMS
College officials are uncertain when the
three new apartment-style dorms, origi-
nally slated for completion in August, will
be ready for occupation.

The dorms, located between the golf
course and the soccer fields, are in various
stages of construction. C building, the one
farthest from Patterson Court, is expected
to be finished first. Construction on build-

ings A and B will be completed approxi-
mately three to five weeks after C.

One hundred and forty-four seniors were
planning to live in the apartments until a
letter issued from the housing office this

- summer informed them otherwise.

The seniors have been placed in tempo-
‘ary housing until the new dorms are ready.

Because their dorm will be the first
completed, the residents of C building have
deen placed in lounges and faculty and
staff homes- what Director of Residence
Life Tom Jennings considers the most
temporary housing.

Building A is the next to be finished, and
its residents are living in lounges and pe-
rimeter houses. Residents of building B
have been placed in perimeter houses.

Adjustments will be made to student
housing fees on a case-by-case basis, ac-

cording to Jennings. Students living in
faculty and staff homes will not be charged
for the amount of time that they occupy
their temporary housing.

Perimeter house residents will be
charged the double room rate.

Jennings has not set a price for those
living in lounges. Because there is no
phone service, and occupancy varies from
two to four students per lounge, Jennings is
still trying to determine what rate structure
will be used.

Administration officials are meeting this
week with the contractors to finalize the
date of completion for dorm C, according
to Jennings. Following this meeting, Jen-
nings plans to: meet with C residents
Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. The time
and date will be announced by the Resi-
dence Life Office.
