Trustees meet during break,
discuss finance, enrollment

By LYMAN COLLINS
Asst. News Editor

The Board of Trustees met
for their regular March meet-
ing over Spring Break. The
Finance, Governance and
Athletic Committees were the
only committees that met
formallly.

‘“‘Of course, the principle
item on the agenda was the
budget,’’ said College Presi-
dent Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

“They approved the ba-
lanced budget with the ob-
vious understanding that
there may be some changes
because we don’t know exactly
how some areas will be af-
fected.”’

The trustees also increased
enrollment by 15 students;
that-will bring it to 1265. Tui-
tion willbe raised $200 and the
laundry fee by $25.

‘‘This is the first time the
laundry fee has been raised in
four years,” explained Spen-
cer.

He also said the trustees
had expressed concern that
Davidson and other private
institutions may be pricing
themselves out of the college
market with the tuition raise.

The second major item be-
fore the board was the appro-
val of the Internal Case State-
ment which describes the Col-
lege’s financial situation.

‘‘The board approved the
principal of the statement but
also felt that there was still
room for change. In effect they

said, ‘‘You’re in the right
direction,’’ commented Spen-
cer.

The third item related to
governance. This involved the
new constitution and proposed
statement of student rights.
Voting on these has been
tabled and docketed until the

May meeting.

SGA President Bo Baskin,
who along with former pres-
ident John Munce presented
the statement, explained,
‘“That was all we hoped for.
We wanted them to look at’it
and vote on it in May.”

He said he thought the
trustees and the Governance
Committee were in favor of it.

““‘We've got to take the
statement to the faculty and
back to the students,” he said.
“There have been substantial
changes since it was first
approved so I would like to see

it again in the form of a

referendum for the students to
vote on.”’

Concerning the president’s
suspension powers the trust-
ees shortened the time lag that

can occur between suspension
and trustee review. Now the
trustees must act on a suspen-
sion by the president with
seven days and have comp-
leted their review in 30 days.

‘‘T was pleased with this
action,”” commented Baskins.
“It protects students, faculty
and the president himself,
from an unfortunate situation.

Baskin commented on the
trustees decision to return
Davidson to national promi-
nence in basketball. ‘‘There
may be some dissent from
some students about the ex-
panded basketball program,”
he said. ‘“‘But most students
are realistic and see how a
strong program may help
Davidson and give the college
a higher national profile.”

Dockery finds stigma problematic

arising,’ said Terry.

Dockery wants to be avai-
lable for the students to use
her skills and knowledge.

She finds two basic prob-
lems that the counseling prog-
ram must overcome: the stig-
ma society places on psycho-
logical counseling and the
difficulty counselors experi-
ence in getting information to
the students.

“One of the things we need
to do is to term these people
just‘counselors,’ dememphasi-
zing the psychological or clini-
cal aspect,’’ said Terry.

‘““My experience here is that
probably a majority of the

students don’t see the imme-.

diate need for counseling. This
is because of the old concept of
the ‘shrink’ or psychologist,”
according to Dockery. ‘It’s

not socially acceptable now.

For me this is a practical
indication of the need for

counseling.”

“T don’t think and (the
counselors) don’t think we
have the facilities to handle
really sick people,’’ said Terry.
“And that’s okay because we
have few or no really sick
students.”

Although most cases are on
a short term basis, Dockery
emphasized that the counse-

lors do give long term clinical

treatment.
\

‘“‘There is no doubt that
through our services we have
helped many students. Many
students we have treated

would not have finished Dav-~

idson if not for counseling,”
Dockery said.

“My schedule is practically
always filled up.”

community’s Arts and Science

Council.

Long to run council

By CHUCK KENNON
Managing Editor

Zach Long, the Director of
Alumni Affairs, has been
chosen to direct the 1976 fund
raising campaign for the Arts
and Science Council of
Charlotte/Mecklenburg in
Davidson.

“The ASC collects and pro-
vides funds for a wide range of
possible community activities.
The ASC was recently reor-
ganized to encompass a large
number of affiliated Arts and
Science groups in the area,”
Long stated.

Money raised during the
campaign will be util-
ized by 45 cultural organiza-
tions, including Davidson
college and the community
Schoolhouse for the Arts, that

are connected with ASC. The

campaign goal is $261,891 and
the drive lasts through March
31)

Long explained that 13
organizations get direct fund-
ing. ‘‘That includes the
Schoolhouse for the Arts, in

addition to such groups as the

Charlotte Nature Museum,
Symphony Orchestra, and the
Oratonio Singers,’ he added.
Other groups are eligible to
apply for grants from a ‘‘pro-
ject pool.” The college fits into
this category, Long said.

The ASC recently expanded
from seven to 45 affiliated
groups in an effort to shift the
emphasis of cultural activities
in the area away from “‘black
tie’ events. Popular interests
will be more represented in the
new members, which include
the Afro-American Culture
and Service Center, the Little
Theater of Charlotte, the
Queen City Aquarium Society,
and the Charlotte Hand-
weavers’s Guild.

Long said that ‘‘the ASC
membership won’t be a direct
attraction to students, but the
full meaning of the relation is
open to exploration. The ASC’
has only contacted professors
and staff, but student partici-
pation in the drive is welcome.
The ASC also hopes for
student input into their
programs.
