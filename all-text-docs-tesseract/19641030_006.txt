The annual YMCA Drive has
been extended beyond its plan-
ned one week duration due to
a very slow response from the
students.

The drive, which started Oct.
8 and was to culminate Oct.
15, has fallen far short of col-
lections of previous years. Up
to now only $2,000 has been
collected from the students.

spoke with a relaxed and capa-

thoughtful and candid in his
replies to questions.

Michael Light, Ed Dwelle Rehearse For Coriolanus

Coriolanus Curtain
Veit Open Thursday

Coriolanus is one of the most
neglected plays of Shakespeare,
but it is not because it is a bad
play. A great deal of the whole
pattern of modern politics is
involved in it. The whims that
lie between the making of war
and the preservation of peace,
the gap between the rich and
the poor, and the forces of men
and happenings which produce
traitors are all present in this
play. ‘

Coriolanus. the man, is a
soldier and a nobleman of
great honesty and integrity in
a society where to gain power
it is quite necessary to lie or at
least shade the truth to the
peopte. His downfall was that
he could not bring himself to

do it.

_ He was driven out of his own
country, forced to go over to
the enemy and to help bring

the duties of the nation’s high-
est office. . a.

After this brief and bipar-
tisan topic the Presidential
aide moved to Senator Gold-

Senate. ‘Voting against Re-
publicans and Democrats
alike, “ Wilson noted, ‘‘Sena-
tor Goldwater seems to want
the repeal of the twentieth
century.”

_Seeking public office when he
should have been trying to be
more of a politician, is also
in keeping with the week of a
national political election.

The performance will be on
ithe single unit set, constructed
by Howard Bryan, which will
serve as everything from a bat-
tle field to the Roman forum.
Steps, platforms and a bridge
are central to the set design,
keeping with the essential ele-
mets of the Elizabethan stage.
With this type of setting. the
scene moves swiftly from one
part of the stage to another.

The orinicple roles in the
piay are held by Simon Black-
ford, Michael Light, Smith Mc-
Keithen, Ed Dwelle. Alex Bern-
hardt, Mrs. Constance Welsh.
Dr. Tom Clark. and Dupre
Jones.

with particular force (quoting
from appropriate Goldwater
texts) the candidate's chang.

mind, he will now deny that
he ever held his former atti-

Joint Effort Sponsors Singer

tionally famous concert artist.
will present a concert in Char-
lotte’s Ovens Auditorium at
8:15 p. m. next Wednesday.
Her appearance is sponsored
jointly by Davidson College and
Charlotte College.

Miss Anderson's Charlotte
performance is the only con-
cert she has scheduled in the
Carolinas during her world-

“ayy

wide farewell tour. The tour
began in October and will in-
clude nearly 50 cities in the
United States and the major
cities of South America, Europe.
and Asia. Miss Anderson will
give her final concert on Easter
Sunday at Carnegie Hall.

Free tickets for the Char-
lotte concert were made avail-
able to Davidson students and
some 280 requested them. How-
ever, C, Shaw Smith, director
of the College Union. stated
that only about 200 had been by
his office to claim their tickets.
He added, “I believe this re-
sponse is quite good since Miss
Anderson made her reputa-
tion before this current: gener-
ation was ever born. I can't
help wonder what happened to
the 80 students who have not
claimed their tickets.”

Charlotte College also made
free tickets available to ‘its
students, and tickets are cur-
rently bsing offered to stud-
ents of other local colleges at
reduced rates. The two col-
leges are also selling tickéts
to the general public.

Miss Anderson was born and
educated in Philadelphia, and

defeat upon his mother count-

several White House concerts
and sang at the inaugurations
of Presidents Eisenhower and
Kennedy. She _ received the
Freedom. Medal from President
Johnson in December of last
year, and has received num-
erous other national and inter-
national awards including 24
honorary doctorate degrees.

Miss Anderson has sung be-
fore 7,000,000 people during
her career. in nearly every
country of the world. One of
-her most important tours was
the one sponsored by the Siate
Department in 1957, which took
her through the Far East and
was immortalized in Edivard

“The Lady from Philadelph'a.”

her after a 1935 concert. “A
voice like yours is heard only
once in a hundred years.” In
1915, she became the first Ne-
gro to sing at the Metropolitan
Opera. .

She is depicted in a mural in
the Department of the Interior
in Wadhington, commemorat-
ing her famous Easter Sunday
concert in 1939, when, denied
the use of Constitution Hall be-
cause of her race, she sang
from the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial before an outpouring
of 75.000 people. She sang from
those steps again in August.

Secor Speaks Tuesday
On What Else? - Politics

By AL CARSON
Davidsonian Feature Writer
On election day, Tuesday.

Dr. Philip Secor. political
science mentor. will treat
Davidson to a wrap-up discus-
sion of the national political
situation. His assembly pro-
gram will center around com-
ment on an article written for
the Charlotte News, “Laugh
and the World Laughs With
You.”

Primarily a discourse on the
electoral process and its rela-
tion to the candidates, the
speech will cover the “forgone
conclusion” of L. B. J.‘s victory,
continuing to include the un-
usual aspect of humor and the
present campaign.

Dr, Secor maintains that
Johnson will win by a lot, be
cause he has a sense of humor.
Those enlightened by a sense
of humor will reject the sour-
pusses” of the Goldwater fac-
tion.

After. his ill-fated prediction
last spring that Nelson Rocke-
feller would win the Republican
nomination and the Presidential
election, Dr. Secor has thor’
oughly studied all the current
polls and relies heavily upon
them.
