Last Game of Season
Lost to Statesville

Game Won in Last Five Minotes
of Contest.

Davidson's basketball season of 1917
was closed on last Thursday night, when
Statesville Y. M. C. A. won a close and
hard fought game played on the States-
ville floor, by the score of 37 to 31.
This was the deciding game of a series
of three between these two teams, each
having won a contest.

The game was fast thruout, and the
spectators were kept in suspense on ac-
count of the frequently tied score. Both
teams were in excellent form, and every
man deserves special mention for his
good work. It was in the last fivé min-
utes of play that the Statesville five
forged ahead, and won the game.

The line-up was as follows:

STATESVILLE. POSITION. DAVIDSON.

Strupper .. bene .. Childs

chestra and Glee Club, has announced a
very pleasant trip during the month of
March. They will give a concert at
Lenoir, Hickory. Marion, and two con-
certs in Asheville. One of the Ashe-
ville concerts will be given at the Ashe-
ville Normal, and the other for the
benefit of the High School. ‘This trip
was taken last vear, with the exception
of the date at Hickory, and it is ex-
pected that the trip this time will prove
even more pleasant and successful.
There will probably be another trip
taken about the middle of April, thru
South Carolina.

On Saturday night of Junior Speaking
the Orchestra and Glee Club will give
a concert on the Hill, which will be one
of the best that has ever been given here.

‘Tuesday, March 6th, at 7:30 p. m.. in
Shearer Hall, bv Mr. L. O. Armstrong.

definite subject of the lecture cannot be
given just now, it is thought that it
will be about “The Natural Resources
and Industries of Canada.” Mr. Arm-
strong was a popular lecturer at the
Panama Pacific Exposition, is well ac-
quainted with Canadian matters and
life, and has spent a number of years
taking and collecting interesting pictures

lectures.

VOLUNTEER CONFERENCE
TO BE HELD NEXT WEEK

Fifty men from Davidson are wanted
to go next week to Greensboro, to at-
tend the North Carolina Student Volun-
teer Conference. to be held March oth.
toth and sith. One of the main speak-
ers is Dr. W. R. Dobyns, of St. Joseph.
Mo.. who conducted an enthusiastic re-
vival among Davidson men year before
last. Dr. Dobyns was also the man who
led the quiet hour every night at the

Laymen’s Missionary Convention in
Charlotte.
The only expense to the Davidson

delegates who attend the conference will
be railroad fare (round trip, $3.50).
plus a one dollar registration fee. All
entertainment and other expenses will be
met by the conference.

Many Davidson men have already
signed up to go to this conference, and
as there is not going to be a Y..M. C. A.
conference this year, there’s no reason
why fifty men from Davidson can‘t at-
tend this Greenshoro conference. All
who expect to go should see P. B. Price,
29 Rumple, at once, and secure advance
registration.

Program Announced Another Scoreless Game!News and Happenings

In Class Foot Ball

Seniors Fail in Effort to Win
Championship.

In a muddy and exciting game of foot-
ball last Saturday afternoon, the Sophs
and Seniors battled thru four quarters
without a score being made by either
side. this being the fourth game out of
the six played in the series which has
resulted in a scoreless tie. ‘This was the
last scheduled game of the class foothall
season, but as it leaves the Juniors and
Seniors tied for the championship, a de-
ciding game will probably be played, tho
this has not been determined as yet.

The game was one of the hardest
fought of the whole season. The heavs
field and lack of practice on the part of
hoth teams prevented it from being a
first-class exhibition. The first half was
played largely in the middle of the field,
and neither team seemed to have the ad-
vantage. In the third quarter, however
the Sophs, after brilliant end runs by
Johnson and line plunges by White, car-
ried the ball to the Seniors’ 2 foot line.
but the fourth-vear men here secured the
hall on downs. and punted out of danger.

In the last half a large number of for-
ward passes were tried, but most of these
were either incomplete or intercepted by
opposing players. Craig received a pret-
ty one from Keesler and made a good
gain for the Seniors.

The stars for the Sophs were John-
son, White and McAskill, while Kees-
ler. Ratchford and Miller plaved espe-
cially well for the Seniors.

The line-up was as follows:

SOVIES, POSITION. SENIORS.

FRESHMEN ARF GIVEN

An innovation has been established in
the Freshman English class which bids
fair to be very successful. ‘Thru the ef-
forts of the Faculty the services of Prof.

year, have been secured to teach the same
subject this spring. He arrived the 2oth

and is given the Freshmen in the place
of their regular English work. The stu-

PATTON SPEAKS AT
Y.M.C. A. MEETING
The address before the Y. M. C. A.
on last Thursday night was given bv J.
G. Patton, "16, now at Union Theologi-.
cal Seminary, upon the subject, “A Call
to the Gospel Ministry.” The speaker
pointed out first the things in which the
minister may excel in service to God and
to man more than can the physician, the
lawyer, or the business man. He next
outlined the great need for more men
in the field in order to properly carry
on the work of the Kingdom, and in
this connection outlined the character of
the men who are required for the work,
emphasizing the fact that they must be
consecrated, strong, self-sacrificing. and
devoted to the work. Next the duties
of the minister were given and the serv-
ices which he may render to man both
spiritually and physically as well as in
matters of education, politics, and social -
reform. The responsibilities of the min-
ister were next presented and then the
rewards of the ministry. The address
was concluded with a plea to come out
on the Lord’s side and dedicate to God's
service the life that has been given to

every creature.
