‘Cats Face Endurance Test

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

The Wildcats cannot afford
to lose another game in the
Southern Conference if they
want to hold their conference
lead into the tournament.

The ‘Cats are riding an un-
easy first place with a 6-1
record,

Willlam and Mary looms
close behind with a°5.2 con-
ference record,

This week ‘the Wildcats
will face an endurance con-
test that will determine
whether they maintain their
position.

They face three conference
foes in five days here at
Johnston Gym,

Tomorrow night the ‘Cats
begin with Furman,

Furman beat Davidson

two-months ago in Green-
ville, and now holds fourth
place in ‘the conference,

Coach Terry Holland_ said
that he could not foresee a
repeat of their last meeting.

Besides’ holding the na-
tural homecourt advantage,
the ‘Wildcats will have the
help of Bryan Adrian.

Adrian played only five
minutes in the Richmond
game and did not play at
all, in the Duke game last
Tuesday, due to a cold, but
should be back in the lineup
this week, Holland stated.

‘After the Furman contest,
the 'Cats will face The Cita-

Thinelads Travel
To Big 7 Meet

By DAVE TIERNEY
Sports Writer

The Wildcat track team
will be competing in one of
its toughest indoor meets to-
day and tomorrow, the Big
7 meet at Chapel Hill, ac-
cording to track coach Heath
Whittle.

Members of the Big 7,
who hold the annual meet,
include Davidson, North Car-
olina, North Carolina State,
Duke, Wake Forest, North
Carolina Central, and East
Carolina.

Whittle is sending 15 men
into the scheduled _ events.
He stated that the ’Cats
foremost chances of placing
are the 60 yard dash with
Tom Richardson. and the 60
yard hurdles with Ray
Swetenburg.

Speaking of the meet, he
commented, ‘Of course all
“the teams except Davidson
are subsidizéd, which puts
us at a terrible disadvantage
in the first place.’’

Swetenburg, the ’Cats
hurdler, should have his
hands full. He will be run-
ning against Duke's Jeff
Howser.

Swetenburg said, ‘‘Howser

went to the Olympic time

trials in 1968 and was lead-
ing the. high hurdles until
he-hit the final one. He was
hurt all last year but if he
is in condition this year he
will be very tough.’

Richardson, who set a new
Davidson indoor record in
the 60 yard dash two weeks
ago, is also optimistic.

Coach Whittle commented
that the times this week will
very likely to be slow,
because the competition will
be held in an old gym with a
hardwood surface.

Both Swetenburg and Rich-
ardson stated that they did
not care to run on the sur-
face. The chances of slipping
while hurdling are _ parti-
cularly high.

Coach Whittle, though not
optimistic’ about the overall
meet, is never the less look-
ing for some fine individual
performances.

Other individuals he cited
include.'‘Steve Shankweiler, a
shotputter and George Ed-
wards and Howard Boyd,
both distance men.

This is the last meet in-
doors: until. the conference
championships March 6 at
V.M.1 ;

Holland said,‘‘Ledbetter and
a guard, Sutor.”’

He said that the defense
that the "Cats have main-
tained throughout tha sea-
son should be tested in both
of the games.

Next Wednesday night the
Wildcats will meet V/M.I.

The Keydets should not of-
fer great resistance to Da-
vidson. They now. hold last
place in the conference with
only one- win, over Rich-
mond,

They were easily beaten
by Davidson in_ their last
meeting.

“IL suppose they will play
better than they did in Lex-
ington,’ Holland said, ‘‘be-
Cause I can't believe they

are really that bad."

Last week the Wildcats
eased by the Richmond
Spiders 80-70.

The game stayed close un-
til the last .minutes when
‘Davidson pulled ahead on
foul shotting.

High scorer for the Wild-

cats was Joe Sutter with 23 -

points. nf
Sutter also held rebound-
ing honors with 11.
Tuesday the ‘Cats
beaten by Duke 64-55.

Davidson only held the
lead once late in the game,
and then by one point.

Duke then began a ral-
ly that stifled the Wildcats
last surge and went ahead
with a quick ten point, lead.

were

stronger on paper than we
are,” he said, ‘“‘but we hope
we can pull it out like we
did against The Citadel.”

Parker was a little more
optimistic about the Catawba
contest.

He said that the Cata-
mounts and the ‘Cats were
very much alike and that he
would only predict a close
contest for the two terms.

In the meet with The Cit-
adel the ’Cats held an ad-
vantage due to a forfeit to
Rick Stansbury in the first
match.

The ’Cats lost the next
three to allow -a_ Bulldog
lead 13-5, but did ‘not lose
the advantage during the
rest of the meet.

Jim Purcell, a ’Cat fresh-
man, beat Jim Williams, the
Citadel wrestler who led the
Southern Conference last
year.

Frank Shinn, an 190 pound
freshman for the ’Cats de-
feated his heavyweight op-
ponent, a 300 pounder.

Shinn held control through-
out the match.

The matmen have suffer-
ed from injuries during the
season. : :

During the Citadel meet
Rusty Winchester sustained
an eye injury that will keep
him out for the next two
meets.

’ Earlier in the season, Jack
Jacobs injured his ankle and
has been unable to wrestle.

George says it’s time to clear out our winter merchandise
and make room for the Spring EXPLOSION!
