The Better
ousetrap

dt you want something more than just a
stereo console, and something less than
a‘ houseful of electronic equipment, see
the KLH* Model Twenty-Four.

The Model Twenty-Four is a complete
stereo music system that plays records, FM
broadcasts, AM too if you wish, plus any-
thing (such as a tape recorder) you care to
plug into it. Instead of looking like a
Viétorian hope chest or an electrician’s
nightmare, it comes in three compact ‘and
unobtrusive walnut cabinets that slip
gracefully into a living room. It won’t take
up much of your valuable livi ing space, and
it doesn’t take a pilot’s license to operate.

But what sets it even further apart from
other stereo equipment is the level of per-
formance it delivers. I, sounds—believe us:
—like twice the price. That's why it’s the
best-selling, most-talked-about stereo sys-
tem on the market.

Ask anyone who owns KLH stereo equip-
ment about its performance and value.
Then seek out the Model Twenty-Four

and judge it critically for yourself. -
You won’t have trouble finding one in a

store. Just follow that well-beaten path,
