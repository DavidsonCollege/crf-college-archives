THE DAVIDSONIAN

Frank Looks To
Win Big South
Conference Title

By Robert Grubb

Men’s tennis coach Jeff Frank
will lead the most talented team he
has had in recent years into its
second and final Big South cam-
paign this spring. The Wildcats,
who finished second to Campbell
in last year’s tournament, are one
of several teams who expect to
compete for the conference crown.
Inaddition to Campbell, Winthrop
and Radford have made additions
which improve already strong
squads.

Davidson returns nine starters
from last year’s squad. Frank
graduated only one senior, number
three player Kurtis Zabell, last year.
The loss did not seem to be felt as
the Wildcats tore through their
opponents in an incredible fall
season. The Wildcats posted a
perfect 4-0 record in dual matches
and an equally impressive 5-1
record in tournament play.

The high points of the fall
season were a Parent’s Weekend
defeat of cross-county rival UNCC
and a near sweep of the Washing-
tonand Lee Tournament. Davidson
also defeated Liberty 9-0' in its
only Big South Conference match.

Davidson’s: strength is its
depth. The Wildcats are as solid
from top to bottom as they have
ever been. Joey Manibo, a defend-
ing Big South Champion, currently
is seeded seventh because the depth
of the team is so great. “There are
three guys who are ready to step
into the starting six any time,” said
Frank. “The guys are really going
to have to be on their toes and play
hard every time the;y step on the
court or someone is going to grab
their place.”

The starting lineup is led by |

junior Albie Varoski at number
one. Varoski is not a dominant
force at number one, but he posted
an impressive 10-3 record in the
fall. Frank said that Varoski has
gained the confidence to play at
number one. “Albie doesn’t havea
huge serve and volley game,” said
Frank. “He can play smartand beat
his opponents by moving them
around.”

Senior David Jespersen, whig
missed most of fall season with a
sprained ankle regains his spot at

Russell Briggs is the third seed,
followed by freshman Holt
Vaughan. Another freshman,
Daniel Grinnan, holds down the
fifth slot. Dave Tonidandel, who
went undefeated in the fall season,
posting a 12-0 record, rounds out
the top six.

Senior John Beyer once again
leads the Wildcats at number one
doubles. Beyer is paired with
Vaughan. Beyer lends the combi-
nation considerable experience,
having teamed up with Kurtis
Zabell last year to form one of the
strongest doubles teams in recent
Wildcat history. Briggs teams up
atnumber two doubles with senior
Dale Voeks, another one of the
team’s strongest doubles players.

>The number: three seed: in
doubles is Varoski and sophomore
Chris Parker. Sophomore Ryan
Harper will likely pair with fellow
sophomore Eythan Sontag to round
out the Davidson lineup.

Frank is particularly pleased
with the quality of the doubles
combinations. The Wildcats have
struggled with doubles during the

past three years, losing several
matches in the doubles portion of
the competition. The team has re-
sponded to Frank’s increased
emphasis on doubles and has im-
proved its doubles play in each of
the past two years.

Davidson opened its spring
seasonon Feb. 11 inanaway match
against South Carolina. The Game-
cocks are young, but several na-
tionally-ranked juniors should
make an immediate contribution
to the team. The South Carolina
match follows in a long Davidson
tradition of opening the season with
tough matches. South .Carolina,

\ ranked number one: in the South-

east and in the top 15 nationally,
could be the Wildcats’ toughest
opponent of the year.

Davidson lost 9-0, but played
very well according to Frank.
Nearly all the matches were close
but the Wildcats were unable to

gain a victory. “They just played
the big points better than we did,”
said Frank.

David Jespersen played well
in his first match back in action.
Dave Tonidandel also played well
at number five, winning
Davidson’ s only singles set. “Dave
gave his opponent fits,” said Frank.
“He never gets out of a match
because he has sucha positive atti-
tude.”

The high point of the match
was the Davidson’s doubles play.
The numbers one and two doubles
teams both took their matches to
three sets. Even though neither
team was able to gain a win, the
results were impressive because
both of the South Carolina teams
are ranked in the top 25 nationally.
“I have to be happy because we
played with the toughest team on
our schedule,” said Frank.

Frank hopes the Wildcats will

Tennis Center on Friday at 4 and 6

Davidson’shome courtadvan-
tage will also be improved this
season by the new seating being
put in at the Covington Tennis
Courts. Combined with moveable
bleachers, the new permanent seat-
ing will provide seating for nearly
1,000 spectators on all 10 courts.
The new seating is being put in for
the Big South Tournament, which
will be held at Davidson Mar. 16-
18. The school also plans to bid for
the Southern Conference Tourna-
ment in 1993, when Davidson will
return to Southern Conference
competition.
