~ Polley Tours, Studies Egypt:
| Nixon Sets Mood For Visit

By BRUCE CORSER
Senior News Editor

'.. Capitalizing on Nixon’s

sojourn to the Mid-East,
Professor of Religion Max
Polley spent two months this
summer touring, studying,
and gathering impressions of
Egypt.

. As a part of the Indiana Con-
sortium for Intellectual

’. Progréss, Polley was centered
| at the American University in
. Cairo. The avowed purpose of
* this consortium was to study

Egyptian culture and then
construct curricula for a

= variety of different age levels
* in the Indiana public schools.

_. Polley concentrated on the
religious life of the Egyptians.

“Nixon got there two days
before we arrived, so we were
very well received,” Polley
commented. He indicated that
this treatment was in sharp

« contrast to the reception with

Deprivation, Kushigian Meet

By JOHN STANFIELD
Staff Writer

The new assistant director
of the College Union, Russ
Kushigian, leaned forward
and smiled like he had the per-

KUSHIGIAN

fect response. “I think I know
what students want out of the
union,’’ he quipped, “because
I have a degree in Education
and I’ve worked with disad-
vantaged children.”’

Kushigian knew that his

analogy to deprivation was

well founded. ‘People in their

junior year have never seen

the Union as anything but a

temporary one in an old

eng he said. “It’s: too
d.’”’ .

- He leaned on his desk and

stroked his beard in one of his
more serious moments. ‘‘We
can’t be a real center of Union
activities operating out of a

booth.”

The union has been tem-
suid located—for nearly

story building previously used
to house college guests.

January when the Union wil!

“Be able to move into what was

the old library.

Since his arrival at David-
son Kushigian has taken over
responsibilities for the Artist
Series, but he foresees few
major changes in the Union’s
operating procedures.

“‘We are not operating at full
steam now,’ he admitted

College Gets Grant:
For Science Research

By NANCY NORTHCOTT_
Staff Writer

Davidson College has
receivedra $12,400 grant from
the National Science Foun-
dation to be used in pur-
chasing scientific research
equipment. Part of this equip-
ment will be used to furnish
the third: floor of the Dana
Science Building for use by the
Biology department.

Chairman of the Biology
department Donald S. Kim-
mel indicated that the in-
creased space was needed to
provide for increased
enrollment, a growing staff,
and’ increased research ac-
tivity.

The third floor presently
houses one classroom-lab and
the lab for one of. the staff
members. Most of it serves as
storage space., When planned
remodelling has been com-
pleted, the third floor will con-
tain at least two student labs,

a student research operation,

anda seminar study room.
Planned facilities also in-

‘elude areas for work with

radioactive » space
for the sorting of field collec-
tions, and the biology museum
collection. The facilities will
be for use by students and
faculty members.

“There is a slight problem

with the eaves coming down,
but in terms of the floor space
and actual working space, the
third floor has just as much
room as the other two floors of
the building, ’’ Kimmel said.

“The extra space will allow. .

the Biology department to ex-
pand while staying under the
same roof.”’

The college has an ap-

plication for funds pending
with the -Dana Foundation
which funded the initial con-
struction of the building.

Results are expected to be

rsheard this month. ,

before Nixon’s visit.

‘Phe President of Ohio
State was arrested for taking
pictures in front of his hotel a
week before we arrived. But
once Sadat shook Nixon’s
hand, almost everything
opened up,” he said. Never-
theless, the Consortium was

Polley observed that the
people in Cairo were very
polite to foreigners. Doors
were sometimes held open and
the Egyptians would often
surround the American group
hoping to have their picture
taken. Furthermore, there
was no jostling as in the
streets of a big American city.
_ “The city itself is cver-
crowded,” Polley said. “In
1966, its -population was 3
million and now it’s 7 million.

on roof-tops.” This massive
growth is primarily due to the

refugee influx from the Sinai

Peninsula as a result of the
Mid-East conflicts.

Polley noted that Cairo is
presently in tight economic
straits. ‘“Many of the upper-
class citizens are seeking
ways to leave the country so

that they might make some

money. Generally they are
frustrated, ” he said.

Polley saw many aspects of
Egyptian life during his stay.
‘“‘Tahrir”’ - the Egyptian word
for freedom - is a land
reclamation project in the
delta area. He talked to some
officials involved in this ‘‘ex-
citing” project in which farm-
land is obtained from the
sea and the desert.

Engineers working on the
reclamation were trained in
Holland which specializes in
this area. The project takes
about five years to develop
arable farmland.

ted which can grow in salt
water. This rice eventually
desalinates the land. so that,

two big crops in Egypt,”
Polley said. “T “They don’t put
the grapes on wires but rather
