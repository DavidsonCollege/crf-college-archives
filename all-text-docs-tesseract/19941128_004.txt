mons three times a day, as do some
800 or so other students. Every
time I go through the same routine:
get my card run through the ma-
chine, get into a line, and eat my
food. Seemingly, this routine is all
there is to Davidson’s kitchen of
culinary splendor. But there is,
both literally and figuratively,
much more than meets the eye.

There are offices upstairs and
a huge kitchen facility behind the
serving lines. There are also many
people who are responsible for one
of the most important aspects of
campus life. endeavored to move
beyond mere routine and to learn
just how the Commons works.
The health issue: choices, likes

and dislikes

Barbara Metzler, Manager of
the Commons, is responsible for
the efficiency and quality of ser-
vices at Vail. She guides the Com-
mons with an eye toward meeting
students’ needs and desires and
responding to their immediate situ-
ations. She says, “We try to go by
student likes: and dislikes: what
they take a lot of and what they do
not take a lot of.”

Acommonly heard complaint
about the Commons is that none of
the offerings are healthy. But for
Metzler, healthy eating is intri-
cately tied with student choices.
“All food to me is healthy. How
we put it together is up to the
student.”

This philosophy means that a
hamburger and fries for lunch ev-
ery once in a while is not un-
healthy. But to eat that meal five
times a week certainly would be
unhealthy. Another example of
this theory is given by Kathy Wood,
the special projects manager: re-
gardless of the amount of lettuce,
cucumbers, and broccoli one puts
into a salad, it will never be healthy
if drenched in high-fatranch dress-
ing.

For Metzler, the discussion of
the nutritiousness of Commons

and dislikes,” she says.

Metzler is hesitant to label
some food healthy, because
“healthy” is a relative term. A
student trying to cut all fat from his
or her diet may not consider a dish
healthy if it has 15 percent of its
calories from fat; another student
may choose that same dish. Stu-
dents are prepared to make eating
decisions for themselves. ‘“‘Stu-
dents have more knowledge about
food. [They] make more educated
choices,” Metzler says. :

Reorganizing the Commons:
many choices

“You want choices, options.
We are trying to meet that need,”
Wood says. To this end, the Com-

mons has instituted many changes ,

suchas the alternative bar, the sand-
wich bar, the grill, and the salad
bar.

Two years ago Metzler began
a reorganization of the Commons.
Before that, both lines at dinner
offered the same twoentrees. There
was no alternative bar, grill, or
salad bar.

The alternative bar was insti-
tuted to “give you another choice,
an alternative ... The alternative
bar is just what that means,”
Metzler says. Students requested

. More potatoes, pastas, and beans
and rice dishes than could be ac-*

commodated in the serving lines,
so the alternative bar was created.
The alternative bar “‘is not referred
to as a health bar,” Metzler says.

The salad bar also deserves
students’ attention, according to
Metzler. “If you don’t go to the
salad bar, you are missing part of
what is being offered.” The salad
bar often contains sources of pro-
tein not found in the lines and in
yogurt. “The salad bar adds to the
serving lines” in a different way,
Metzler says.

There is more choice in today’s
Commons than just a few years
ago, says Metzler. All of the vari-
ous bars offer “more opportunity

to create the students’ own pyra-
mid” of healthy eating, Metzler
says.
Healthy means of preparing
food

Inthecooking process, all fry-
ing is done with vegetable shorten-
ing, and 80 to 90 percent of the
vegetables are steamed.

Another concern of students
is the quality of the food purchased
by the Commons. About. this
Metzler says, “What we buy is
quality. Iam very strong on that. I
will not allow us to bring a low-
quality product through the door.”

The hamburgers are grade A,
for instance, with a meat to fat ratio
of 80/20. Vegetables are frozen as
a matter of necessity, but “frozen
vegetables are usually more nutri-
tious depending how they are
cooked,” says Metzler. _

All meats are “fresh” with the
exceptions of skinless chicken and
hamburgers. “I buy choice meats,”
says Metzler.

“We don’t buy a lot of pre-
made products. It is more eco-

nomical [to make things fresh] and
better for all of you,” Metzler says.
Ninety to 95 percent of all food in
the Commons is made from scratch,
says Metzler.

Products such as bread, milk,
and dairy products are delivered
daily. Meats and frozen items are
delivered three to five times a week.

The Fall of the wall: Behind
the lines

As interesting as learning
about the philosophy behind the
Commons’ offerings was, my tour
of the kitchen behind the serving
lines was even better. The kitchen
was immense, a workroom full
people I have never seen before in
the Commons: the cooks, bakers,
and dishwashers. The wall hides
another world we never see and
rarely think about.

The kitchen is the domain of
Dee Philips, Purchasing and Pro-
duction Manager. She is in charge
of buying all of the food, supplies,
and equipment needed to operate
the Commons. Metzler’s philoso-
phy of buying only quality prod-

ucts is actualized by Philips.
Vitality juices, says Philips,
are of the highest quality. “It is the
top of the line,” said Philips.
Stonyfield yogurt is “not a dairy
by-product,” but mall-quality and
mall-expensive and contains less
than one gram of fat, says Philips.
The hot chocolate is Swiss Miss.
The popular chicken nuggets are
made of only muscle meat.
Davidson is the only school in the

‘South to purchase this type of

chicken nugget, and it must be
ordered especially for Davidson
through the distributor.

The Commons’ main distribu-
tor is Biggers Bros., which pur-
chases Biggers Bros. red label
goods or “top products,” says
Philips. Only name-brand prod-
ucts are purchased: General Mills
cereal, Coble milk, Sunbeam bread,
Uncle Ben’s rice, Quaker Oats,
and Washington state apples.

When she _ compares
Davidson’s board plan to the of-
ferings of other schools, Philips
thinks Davidson compares favor-
ably. “I’m proud of the board plan
here at Davidson. A lot of the
things you see here are at cash
operations.”

A cash operation works on an
a la carte basis, where students

have a declining balance for their

meal plan and pay for each item
they choose separately. At a cash
operation, according to Philips,
each glass of Vitality orange juice
would cost around 90 cents, while
Davidson students may have as
many as they want. She says the
quality and offerings of the Com-
mons are as good as at a large cash
operation such as Clemson’s.
Communication with students
Students should read Eric
Sapp’s commentary in last week’s
Davidsonian as an indication of
the Commons’ willingness to ac-
commodate students’ needs. .
For instance, the basketball
team practices past the close of the
Commons on certain days and so
was forced to eat at the Union Cafe
for dinner. When the team asked
Metzler about using their meal
plans at the Cafe, she decided to
