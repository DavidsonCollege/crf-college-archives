Assaults rouse complaints
of security communication

By EMMA CRICHTON —
MILLER
Staff Writer

Following complaints about
security’s response to last
Wednesday’s ‘‘sexual as-
aults,’’ Davidson Police Chief
R. H. Mills is investigating the
police dispatch system in Da:
vidson.

The ‘‘obscene and sexual’’
assaults on two Davidson girls
occurred between the library
and Cannon last Wednesday
night at 8:30 and 8:45. The first
girl said she called security
around 8:45 and reported that
“Three guys are walking around
campus harassing students.”
The second girl said she called
around 11:00 and ‘‘gave the full
nature of the incident.”

The three juveniles were ap-
prehended and escorted off
campus soon afterwards, ac-
cording to Campus Police Chief

J.G. Hughes. Officer Freddie’

Cornelius told the youths they
would be charged with trespas-
sing if they returned.

The two girls, however, are
concerned about the ‘‘casual
attitude with which our reports
were met.”’ When the second
girl called at 11 that night to
find out what had happened to
the youths she was told ‘‘we
caught two of them, the third
ran into the woods.’’ ‘‘The
dispatcher didn’t seem very
concerned,” the girl said.

At 12 that night a friend went
to campus police to see what
had happened. The friend dis-
covered that the security num-
ber (892-5131) is not connected
to campus police at all, but to
the town dispatcher, and: that
the campus policeman on duty
was unaware of any incident.

Campus Police Chief J.G.
Hughes explained Thursday
“The dispatcher said that the
girls were pushed off the side-
walk, the boys should not have

been over there, so Cornelius
got rid of them. They were
picked up about 8:30. There was
just one call. We knew nothing
about the sexual assault,’”’ he
added.

The police released the three
boys, unaware that anything
but ‘‘a little horse play’’ had
taken place.

The two girls involved are
worried about the failure of
‘communications between town
arid campus police.

“I realize that the first report
was not explicit enough, but it
was met with nonchalance. No
descriptions were required and
no further questions were ask-

. ed,” the first girl said.

Both girls are also concerned
that the second call to the town
dispatcher was not reported to
the campus police.

Hughes said that ‘‘although
the dispatch system works well
95 percent of the time, the
dispatcher sometimes gets con-
fused.’’-He explained, ‘‘The
town hall doesn’t have the
money to pay for an efficient
dispatcher.”’

When asked why the College
doesn’t have its own dispatch

vie for editorship
By JOANNA HUNT
Staff Writer

As of Thursday morning,
Merideth Durden and Marshall
Waddell have entered the race
for the editorship of The David-
sonian.

The filing deadline, because
of minor confusion, was exten-
ded through May 3 for the May
8 election.

The ,winner will sérve from
September until December
when regular elections will be
held.

Durden has worked for The
Davidsonian since her freshman
year. She served as Inside Art
Editor, Assistant Features Edi-
tor, and Co-Features Editor
-before becoming Senior Fea-
tures Editor.

As Editor, Durden plans to
readjust the focus of The Da-
vidsonian. “The whole empha-
sis should shift away from
sensationalism,” she said. “I

* think the focus has been on

breaking stories. The emphasis
shouldn’t be there,” she added.
Durden commented that The
Davidsonian should focus on
students. She believes students
prefer to read articles written by”

ATC announces budget appropriations for next year

By BILL WILSON
’ Staff Writer

At its annual budget meeting
on Tuesday, members of the
Activities Tax Council appro-
priated the 1979-80 budget for
college-financed student organi-
zations and activities.

The Council reviewed the
budget requests of eleven stu-
dent, activities. Hobart's Park
and the Black Student Coalition
were appropriated less money
than requested.

According to the minutes of
the meeting, two student publi-
cations, Quips and Cranks and

The dsonian were allocated

the fhost money. Quips and.

Cranks will receive $15,520.
The Davidsonian was alloca-
ted $12,500. It plans to spend
$15,900 next year, with ad-
vertising and subscription in-
come projected to make up the
difference. Printing expenses
are budgeted at $7,000; salaries
and wages are expected to be
$3,000; and $2,000 will go to the
machine fund in case of me-
chanical breakdown. The re-
mainder of the budget includes
photography, postage, office,
and miscellaneous expenses.

Thefts prompt tighter security at lake campus

By KENT DYER
Staff Writer

Recent thefts at the lake
campus have necessitated that
the Athletic Department take
measures to tighten security
there this summer.

Physical Education Instruc-
tor Sue Roberts plans to estab-
lish a private club at the lake
campus this summer to enable
the school to effectively monitor
the area and discourage outsi-
ders. Faculty, staff, and stu-
dents would be allowed free
access to the docks, while all
others would have to pay a
membership fee.

The Physical Education De-
partment plans to hire four
people to assist lake campus
manager Alan Parker.

Last term the campus’ three
canoes,_a pair of the school’s
best water skis, as well as some
other equipment, were stolen.

Senior Brian Jacobs has
managed activities at the lake
for the past two years. Jacobs
said, “When I left school a year
ago we had eight rudders and 10
daggerboards. Now we are able
to outfit only four of our fifteen
scorpions.”

The College has not, as yet,
been able to replace them.

Roberts said the proposed
club would be a great service to
the community and would be
financially rewarding as well.
According to Roberts; ‘‘There is
a surprisingly large number of
people who use the lake campus
in the summer. We hope to

capitalize on this and make
enough money through mem-
bership to pay for improve-
ments in security and staff.”’

The canoes will not be re-
placed until next Fall after the
athletic budget for 1979 is
announced in July. Over the
summer, Roberts plans to seek
outside financial aid from alum-
ni and friends to pay for
proposed security improve-
ments and boat repair.

The program this summer is
entirely experimental. The Ath-
letic Department to date has no
concrete plans for controlling
theft during the school year.
However, it. may continue to
operate the private club next
fall if it is successful this

. Summer.

Other budgets approved were
$7,000 for the Artist Series,
$4,745 for The Miscellany,
$3,750 for the SGA, $2,382 for
club sports,’ $1,100 for the
Wildcat Handbook, $400 for the
Residence Hall Association,
and $350 for the Davidson
Christian Fellowship.

The Davidson Christian Fel-
lowship was not awarded funds
last year on the grounds that it
served only part of the student
body. Council member Gregg
Londrey said that this year the
organization was appropriated
money under the condition that
it sponsor campus-wide func-
tions and activities.

Hobart's Park requested
$5,000 but was only budgeted
$2,200 by the Council. Accord-
ing to Londrey, the request was
based on estimated costs from
the publication of three issues,

“while the Council’s allocation

was made on the basis of only
two publications. Confusion a-
rose over the cost of printing
the magazine as well.

The Black Student Coalition
requested $3,600 but will re-
ceive only $2,000. According to
Londrey, Council members felt
too much of the budget was
earmarked for social functions.
Londrey added that this budget
appropriation is the largest ever
for the Black Student Coalition.

The Council also requested
that the Council on Campus and
Religious Life evaluate student
salaries on The Davidsonian

and .the SGA. Council Chair-
man David Barnard said Coun-
cil members questioned whether
some Davidsonian and SGA
staffers should be paid while
Union positions and Quips and
Cranks editors, among others,
are not.

Barnard said there appears to
be some discrepancy between
salaries and work loads. “The
question appears to be philo-
sophical: whether to pay stu-
dents for their extracurricular
activities or not,’’ Barnard said.
“If so, who do we pay and how
much?”’ he added.

In addition, the Council re-
quested that SGA by-laws be
amended to make the Council
year-long. As presently organ-
ized, it meets annually to review
budget requests for the up-
coming year.

Under the proposed plan,
each student activity would
have to submit a financial
statement two weeks before the
end of each term. The-Council
would review these statements
with supervisory powers over
all expenditures.

“The Council. felt there was

_hot enough supervision over

money allocated throughout the
year,” Barnard said. “The pur-
pose of this (change) is to make
sure they -spend money . more
carefully and follow the budget
more closely.”
The Senate has read the

proposal and will vote on it
Tuesday. as
