Making the grade ©

A friend of mine had aconver-
sation with someone who is con-
sidering coming to Davidson. He
told her about all of the wonderful
aspects of Davidson, but she had
her mind set on attending med
school and was solely interested in
the pre-med program. When he
told her that the pre-med program
at Davidson is wonderful, that the
professors are excellent, and that
the students are very confident in
the program, she was disinterested
and wanted to know the grades she
should expect if she enters
Davidson with intentions of going
pre-med. I was impressed with my
friend’s response, which was,
“Sorry, I don’t think that Davidson
is the place for you.” In theory, I
agreed with him that Davidson is
not the place to simply focus on
making good grades. We are all
well-rounded people who were
accepted toreceive a well-rounded
education. When I see the com-
petitive environment that students
and teachers create, I question
whether Davidson is really the best
place to come and receive a “‘lib-
eral arts education.”

The majority of Davidson stu-
dents place entirely too much em-
phasis on grades. I constantly hear
phrases such as, “If I could ‘just
pull off a ‘B’ on this test,” or, “I

really need an ‘A’ in this class.”
People are desperate to talk to oth-
ers about grades. One of my class-
mates told me out of the blue the
other day that he made an A+ ona
paper. After receiving “‘oohs” and
“aahs” from those who heard him,
he told us that the teacher was an
easy grader, and thathis A+ wasn’t
as good as it seemed. Who cares?
That’s great that he made an A+,
but my view of him wouldn’t be
any different if I found out he made
anything else. I had absolutely no
interest in his grade, and by telling
me he seemed a weaker person.
He obviously thought he would
impress me by telling me about his
A+, or else he would have kept his
grade to himself.

Teachers are just as guilty as
students of creating a competitive
and grade-centered environment.
Many of my professors tell the
class highs, lows, and averages of
graded assignments when return-
ing them. Students begin to imme-
diately lose focus on ways they
improved or could still improve
and frantically worry how they
compare to the rest of the class. I
know that this is true because I
have seen it and been a part of it
myself.

Another guilty party is the
administration. Isaw something at

My second
senior year

This past week as I sat down
for my senior major dinner I was
immediately asked a question
somewhat like, “What are you do-
ing here? I thought you graduated
last year.” Considering that it was
so late in the semester I wasn’t as
well prepared to defend myself as
I had been thousands of times be-
fore. I get asked that question all
the time because I am a second
year senior.

The term “second year senior”
is rather new or unfamiliar to most
Davidson students. Davidson is
known as being a four year liberal
arts school, so it only makes sense
that students come here and gradu-
ate in four years. There are prob-
ably few cases when students do
not graduate in this allotted time
frame, but when students aren’t in
sync with their incoming class they
usually have excuses such as, “I
got sick and had to defer a semes-
ter,” or “I took some time off.” But
even with time taken off, they are
expected to be outa here soon after
their return.

One of my many personal
Davidson struggles has been the
fact that along with not fitting into
the ethnic or socio-economic
Davidson norm, I was unable to
squeeze myself into the four year
graduation bracket either. My fam-

ily and non-Davidson friends were
completely unsympathetic to my
unhappiness about having to re-
turn for an extra semester because
they weren’t coming from my
Davidson perspective. Their view-
point was, “No one graduates in
four years anymore” and “You
graduating, ain’t ya? It don’t mat-
ter when, just get the degree.”
When I really thought about it ona

larger scale, they were right.

I returned to Davidson trying
to keep this larger perspective in
sight, constantly reminding my-
self that nothing was wrong with
me because I was at Davidson for
an additional semester. However,
despite my easygoing and self-suf-
ficient manner, there were times
when comments regarding my old
trout status really made me won-
der why I hadn’t gone elsewhere to
gain my degree instead of continu-
ing to struggle at Davidson.

For example, on my way to a
forum a recent Davidson alum
asked me why I was hanging
around Davidson. I gave her my
practiced line, personally consid-
ering my answer as both polite and
sufficient, but her response sur-
prised me. Almost sighing, she
commented, “well I’m trying to
figure out how you could have
taken time off’ and very obviously

my fraternity house the other day
that almost made me sick to my
stomach. It was a list comparing
the average G.P.A.’s of all of the
fraternities and social houses on
Patterson Court. Could someone
please tell me what purpose this
serves? It is one of the most ob-
noxious.ideas I have ever heard of
in my life.

Why do I care to know the
average G.P.A. of my house or of
any other house? Does it mean that
House A is stupid and irrespon-
sible, or that House B is brilliant
and bound for success in the real
world? Better yet, why don’t we
compare the grades of the basket-
ball team versus the tennis team?
Or, for an even better idea, let’s see
who’s smarter: the history or En-
glish department. Grades are per-
sonal information, and frankly, I
don’t give a damn what anyone
else makes.

Isn’t the purpose of college to
receive an education? If I make all
As, does that automatically mean
that I am getting the most out of my
money — or the best education?
Or what If I graduate with a 2.0?
Does that mean that I am an aver-
age person who will never amount
to anything? The real measure of
success here is how much we can
mature, grow, and improve in four

years. There might be a small
correlation between grades and
improvement for some people, but
the real measure of success comes
from a student’s satisfaction that
he/she has done his/her best and is
a better person for his/her efforts. I
was in a political science class last
semester which I enjoyed thor-
oughly. I made a C+ in the class,
which probably sounds mediocre.
Sounds like I was jipped, espe-
cially considering I didn’t even
take the class pass-fail. I didn’t
worry about the grade, however,
because I saw how my views on
politics changed drastically during
and after taking the class. If you
could put yourself in my shoes and
see how much I learned and be-
came interested in politics, you
would definitely agree that I got
my money’s worth out of that class.
My professor might have thought
that my performance was average,
but I know that it was worthwhile.
I was satisfied with what I learned
and how I grew from taking this
course, and my view wouldn’t have
changed if I had made an “A” or
even a “D.”

Grades lead to competition
among students, and acompetitive
nature in the classroom takes focus
away from the real purpose of
academics: to learn. I am not say-

ing that we should totally neglect
grades. If my grades slip, it is a
good indication that I should work
harder. If I receive a good grade, I
should be pleased with my perfor-
mance, but there is no need for
anyone else to be concerned with
my grades.

Weshouldn’t make grades the
only factor in determining how
much we improve while at
Davidson. Grades are simply a
professor’s measure of how well
we perform in a class. Although
we hold the professors in high re-
gard and value their opinions, we
shouldn’t let the opinions of one
person dictate how we feel about
our efforts and performance in the
classroom. Besides, there is so
much more to learn in life than
what is learned in the classroom.
We have the unusual opportunity
to become involved in so much
more than just academics, such as
athletics, the Union, the SGA,
Davidson Outdoors, and the fine
arts programs.

We need to realize that the
experience gained in these areas
can be just a8 valuable as the expe-
rience gained through academics.
The entire Davidson community
should focus on making the best of
our experience here instead of harp-
ing on the graded results.

‘Rew

begin to re-think where I had been
for all the years that she had asso-
ciated with me. I was immediately
put on guard, assuming that should
tell this person my academic and
personal history. But in my mind
I knew that no matter how much
detail I told, it probably wouldn’t
be enough. Plus, why was I taking
the time to defend myself to some-
one who hardly even knew me,
when I really wanted to be inside
the forum anyway?

Incidents like that have hap-
pened more often than I initially
anticipated. Sometimes to humor
my discomfort I would answer
questions like, “how long are you
in town?” with “for a semester,”
which still eventually leads me into

having to explain why I am carry-
ing a backpack across campus.

I understand that some stu-
dents are questioning my presence
out of pure concern, but I cannot
dent the fact that some folks are
simply nosy and mercilessly want
to know what my problem is, and
why I didn’t graduate in four years
like everyone else. Despite the
personal steps I took (e.g. living
and working off campus) to fur-
ther promote my looking ahead
and outward, much of my time
spent on campus leaves me feeling
very much out of place.

So what’s my purpose in tell-
ing you this? Primarily because I
think there will be more students
returning to Davidson for an addi-

tional semester or year in the near
future, and my hope is that these
students’ additional time here is
just as or more rewarding than
their past years. I don’t believe
this is possible if other students are
constantly badgering them about
their remaining student status.

It is my hope that Davidson’s
students will consider what Maya
Angelou tells us: “human beings
are more alike than unalike.” Thus,
just because a student does not
graduate in four years does not
mean that he or she is any less of a
person, it just means that their tim-
ing is different from everyone else.
Think about that, and try to be:
sensitive to that student’s stand-
point.
