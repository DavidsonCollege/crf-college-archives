ROSA, from page 10

seem gross to Rosa. Also,shehad heard

the same reaction when the subject was
interracial relationships, black and
white “miscegenation.”

Another student, trying to be more
humane, responded that gay men and

lesbians needed counseling to over-

come their deviant behavior in much
the same way that a child molester
would. Many people associated homo-
sexuality with child molestation, but
Rosa could not understand how they
could think of her as connected with
someone who would victimize another
person like that, let alone a helpless,
trusting child.

Someone else quoted some Bible
verses against homosexuality and said

‘itwasasin. She maintained that homo-

sexuals had to stop believing that
they’d been made that way, and instead

heterosexuals. Rosa wished it were that
easy to change and become just like
everyone else so she would never have
to worry about people discriminating -
against her, or even hating her, if they
ever found out her secret. At the same
time, she knew that trying to force her-
self to stop being in love with Catherine
would be futile.

One student argued that God made
men’s and women’s bodies to comple-
ment each other sexually for the pro-
duction of children. He claimed that the
fact that sexual contact between people
of the same gender would not produce
children proved that is was not what
God intended. Rosa thought it was

To Lucia Kendall:

Lucia, we're proud of you for keep-
‘ingon keeping on. We know that every
week in The Davidsonian you'll be in
your space, come hell or high water, on

the Opinions page. Persevere.
Thanks,

rather obvious that the connection his
argument attempted to draw between
preeneny tpecneons and angrelity

kissing, for examples t is not capable of

ever producing children, but nobody
ever announces that is unnatural. And,

as we’ ve all been reminded, if you usea
condom from your friendly Davidson
R.A. or hall counselor, heterosexual
intercourse won’t produce children ei-
ther.

What struck her most was that al-
though many people had formulated
abstract theories about homosexuality,
none of them could have applied their
theories to her. All of them thought of
homosexuals as a bunch of freaks way
off in San Francisco, not as something
their nice, sweet friend Rosa could be
connected with. She wanted to ask

them, “What about me? If tell you my
secret will you suddenly start avoiding
met If you are female, will se always

you insult me and make fun of me be-
hind my back? Will you be patronizing
and judgmental? Will you pretend I
was never your friend?”

In some ways it is much easier for us
to pretend that homosexuality ¢ doesn’t
existamong our friends andtlassmates.
The scarcity of students who havecome
out of the closet is a result not of there
being no homosexuals here, but of the
attitudes that too many heterosexual
students hold. The only way for us to
break through our prejudices is to get
used to the idea that people like Rosado
existat Davidson, and that they deserve
our sincere understanding and accep-

tance, not our judgmen tal theories.
