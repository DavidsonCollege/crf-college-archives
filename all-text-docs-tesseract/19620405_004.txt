Tender Young Minds

BY SAM FORT
Davidsonian News Editor

“The Davidson student
body is unique. Its moral
stamina and standards of
purity, sobriety, and gentle-
manly conduct are admit-
tedly far above the average

” or at least THE DAV-
IDSONIAN thought so_ in
1915.

Whether the assessment was
accurate and whether things
have changed is difficult to say,
but morality is nowhere more
amply and interestingly docu-
mented than in the 50 volumes
of THE DAVIDSONIAN.

GUARDIAN

There are two considerations
to keep in mind im surveying
Davidson morality—or lack of
it—over the past 48 years. One
consideration is that Davidson,
“especially since it is a church-
related school, has traditionally
taken it upon herself to be the
Guardian of her beer-swilling,
lecherous, but nonetheless gen-
tlemanly, scholars’ morality, and
this guardianship has especially
been reflected in the regulations
of the school.”

The second consideration con-
cerns the moral attitudes and
practices of the students, ir-
respective of regulations.

In the first area of considera-
tion; the college's concern’ for
the purity, sobriety, etc. of the
student . body can be traced
from as far back as, say, 1923,
when President Walter Lingle
was warning the incoming fresh-
men of the evils of the automo-
bile, to 1962 and the “Viridiana”
issue.

OFF-CAMPUS DANCES

Undoubtedly feeling that the
wheeled monster was a contriv-
ance of the Devil to cause the
students to waste their time in
“road-flagging and hitch-hiking
to the ends of the earth,” as
Lingle put it, the college did
not allow any student to keep a
car on ‘campus until 1946. It
might be added, too, that radios
weren't allowed in the dormi-
tories until 1934.

All dances, until Midwinters
of 1945, had to be held off
campus (they were usually held
at a Charlotte hotel). The regu-
lation was that ‘The Student
Body of Pavidson College shall
not dance on the property of
the Church.’

It should be added that the
allowing of dancing on holy
ground in 1946 carried with it
the stipulation that the young
ladies be back in Duke dormi-
tory within 30 minutes after the
end of the dance.

FAST WORKER

Whether the wisdom behind
this landmark in moral legisla-
tion arose out of a fear for the
girls’ health due to loss of
sleep, or out of a realistic rec-
ognition of the Davidson Gen-
tleman’s legendary ability to do
fast work, cannot be determin-
ed.

As to how the college felt to.)
ward the foremost moral issue!
year by year—the drinking of |

alcoholic liquors—well, it still
feels the same way.

It is rather ironical that not
only was the faculty concerned
with the morality of the stud-
ents, the students were also wor-
ried about the faculty's soul(s).

, An editorial in the early ‘40's
condemned the inhumane facul-
ty for hiring mercenaries to

murder the campus’ pigeon
population.

WINE, WOMEN

Aste the second way of con-
sidering morality at Davidson,
that of the students’ attitude
and practice, the thinking can

continues to run a close second
to chapel services in its record
of student visits.

fondness for the various brews |

and distillations in more recent
years, then he should have
heard the cries of indignation in
1960, when a 1935 law had been
unearthed in Raleigh which for-
bade the sale of beer and wine
within three miles of Davidson
College.

cal flapper. An editorial in 1923
labeled as an exaggeration the
figure one college's president
drew of college women as being
“hard-drinking, cigarette-puff-
ing, licentious Amazons.”

Further, it seems that The
Woman was almost necessarily
of the local sort. Davidsonians
rejoiced in an editorial in 1925
that “our sister colleges of
Queens, N.C.C.W., Converse,
Greensboro College and others
" did not follow the example
of Bryn Mawr in allowing their
young ladies to smoke.

IDEAL WOMAN

In 1926 Davidson students
were so interested in the Ideal
Woman that THE DAVIDSON.
IAN conducted a poll. The opin-
ion on the morally pertinent
questions concerning the Ideal
Woman, whom they named Mar-
garet, showed that a majority
disapproved of smoking or
drinking by women, but the
thing that astounded the editors
was that 10.8 per cent thought
it was alright for Margaret to
take a drink.

As might be expected, even
for 1926, a majority (55 per
cent) wanted Margaret to make-
out (the term then was “pet-
ting”), while 45 per cent said
absolutely not. The majority
(78 per cent) favored dancing.

Davidson morality in the fu-
ture? This unfortunately is un-
predictable, but perhaps 50
years from now Davidson stud-
ents will casually thumb through
the ancient DAVIDSONIAN vol-
umes of the '60’s and chuckle

quietly to themselves.

The problem of hazing at

' Davidson has apparently
' existed ever since there

have been freshmen and
upperclassmen, and it is in-
teresting to note that hazing
has been formally abolished
here no less than three
times.

The first abolition of mal-
treatment of Davidson fresh-
men occurred in 1916, when all
forms of hazing were abolished,
and according to a DAVIDSON-
IAN editorial, the move was in-
tended to “remove all traces of
‘prepschoolism’ from Davidson
and place her on a footing with
the few best schools in the
South.”

TEN FROSH QUIT

Unfortunately, however, the
“vigilance committee” which
was designated to deal with
freshman conduct proved so in-
effective that hazing returned in
full force. By 1922, hazing had
gotten so out-of-hand that 10
outstanding freshmen quit dur-
ing the fall semester. The school
began to receive very unfavor-
able letters from the heads of
boys’ prep schools as well as
from outraged alumni who de-
manded that the hazing prob-
lem be solved.

Recognizing the desperate
situation, the Student Council
drew up plans for a Court of
Control which would have the
power of punishing freshmen
who violated their regulations,
but which would also protect
the defenseless frosh from any
hazing whatsoever. The student
body unanimously adopted the
council's plans for such a court,
and as a result of this action,
the administration gave the en-
tire student body a holiday.

The Court of Control seems to
have been quite a success early
in its career, because the follow-
ing fall no freshmen felt com-
pelled to leave the campus, and
the upperclassmen seem to have
been content with the job the
court did on the attitudes of the
frosh.

P.O. OFF-LIMITS

Regulations in 1924 included
speaking to everyone, wearing
a beanie, and not walking on the
grass, but the freshmen were al-

office after 8:10 am. until the
last bell for chapel at 8:34 a.m.,
and they were required to re

all upperclassmen had cleared
the room.

The first word of discontent
with the Court of Control ap-
peared in a DAVIDSONIAN edi-
torial in 1931. It seems that the
court had been missing many
offenders because upperclass-
men were not turning them in,
‘and this was rendering the court
ineffective. The suggested solu-
tion was to enlarge the court so
that it could serve not only as a
regulator, but as an advisory
board to the frosh, and this
larger court would have the
power to call up anyone it wish-
ed, whether the party was turn-
ed in or not.

Professors Once
Outrated Girls

A DAVIDSONIAN during the
war years recalled a time when
students liked to visit their pro
fessors more than date girls.

It said that in the past (it
did not say wien), “The David-
son Gentleman hardly ever
missed a Sunday night at the
home of one of his favorite pro
fessors . . . He looked forward
to the weekend as we do today
—only instead of trying to de
cide whether he would give the
girls at W.C. or Queens a treat,
he debated with himself wheth
er he would visit Dr. Brown
. . . or Professor White . .

In the clinching sentence, he
used the war-time conditions in
campaigning for a revival of the
custom, for at that time cars
were “about as scarce as Coca
Cola stands on a_ western

desert.”

Rush Practices Have Tradition

Of Much Discussion, Little Change

The 48 years since the foundin
sion on the conduct-of fraternity ru

BY BOB REYNOLDS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

of THE DAVIDSONIAN have seen much discus-
, but few changes made. For the most part these

changes have not been radical and were usually meant to maintain the friendly at-
mosphere that prevails around the court.

One of the most noticeable
trends is the updating of rush
week to the beginning of the fall
term. In 1927, November was
the month of rush parties and
bids, but five years later rush
began on the second week of
school. This tendency for early
rush has continued.

The chief opposition to this
trend was the faculty’s 1960
ruling for sophomore rush. In
March of that year, with a

move that took the student -

body by surprise, the faculty
voted overwhelmingly to be-
gin sophomore rush in the
fall term of 1961. No recall
was expected. However, a long
program of pledge training
re-evaluation began with the
hope of eventual reinstate-
ment of freshman rush.

After months of discussion of
proposed revisions, the first
hope for fraternity men came in
President D. Grier Martin’s
statement of November, 1960,
“I think for Davidson with the
quality of men which come here
and the quality of the way the
fraternity system is set up, that
quick rush is better over all.”
However, he added, “Whatever
has been done or demonstrated

has not made much impression
on the faculty.”

THE DAVIDSONIAN, though
originally in favor of sophomore
rush, reversed its decision, most-
ly on the grounds that a ruling
which at least 60 per cent of
the student body oppose would
be detrimental to the school.
The resulting lack of freshman
social life and increased possi-
bility of “dirty rush” were also
factors.

The faculty, as a result of
actions on the part of the
fraternity presidents, post-
poned the effective date of
sophomore rush for at least a
year. In conjunction with this
were the rulings limiting the
time and services a fraternity
could expect of its pledges.

As far as the mechanics of
rush are concerned, an import-
ant change was the elimination
of informal bidding prevalent
around 1949. After three days
of rush parties, a fraternity
would extend informal bids to
freshmen, which if accepted
would let the rushee join his
chosen fraternity without going
through the rest of the parties.

The reason for the elimina-
tion was the practice of “hot-

boxing” in ,which a freshman
who received a bid was backed
into a corner and high pressur-
ed into joining. A poll of the
student body at the time showed
that while 53 per cent of the
upperclassmen favored infermal
rush (with 42 per cent opposed),
54 per cent of the freshmen dis-
liked the practice.

In 1927, if a rushee had re-
ceived more than one bid he was
allowed a half-hour conference
with each fraternity and a half-
hour to make a decision. At the
end of that time he was to walk
to the house of his choice. In
1932, 15 minute periods replac-
ed the half-hour ones.

Before the restriction of
rush to the town limits of
Davidson, rush parties occur-
red throughout the area, with
Charlotte and the river being
favorite locations. At many of
these, girls were present to
further lure freshmen toward
a fraternity pin.

One rule in effect in 1916,
during the time of late rush,
stated, “Freshmen will not be
permitted to enter any frater-
nity hall during the fall term,
unless a lady is present in the
