Library Will Display
Works Of Sandburg

In connection with the scheduled
lecture Carl Sandburg here, a
special display of some of his rep-

Gray

of

of

resentative works is being arranged
in the library. Included in the dis-
play will be critical and biographi-
cal works about him.

Sandburg, who will be in David-
son September 12, comes as one of
the best known and most popular
of present-day American poets, one
of the leaders in the modern move-
ment toward free verse. Although
he is primarily a poet, Sandburg is
well-known as a biographer, hav-
ing written a best-selling biography
on Abraham Lincoln.

This lecture is presented by the
Lecture Committee of the college,
composed of Professors E, F. Shew-
make, C. K. Brown and H. T. Lilly.
It is free, and friends of the college
as well as students are invited.

These cuts will begin Friday,
October 2 and continue through
until Monday morning, October

Dixon Is Chosen As
Junior Cheer Leader

Willard Dixon recetved a ma-
jority of ballots over Sam Ryburn,

last Wednesday in the race to de-

termine the fourth Junior cheer
leader.

The other assistants to © Senior
Cheer Leader Gene Voler are: EI-

more Holt, Jerry Harris, and Wade
3arrow. They were elected on the
first ballot.

The full squad of cheer leaders
had their first chance to perform
as such at the pep meeting last Fri-
day night in the stadium. Working
with a large body of noisy students,
they drew out cheers that resound-
ed loudly from the other side of
the stadium.

Between cheers, Vogler took the
opportunity of warning freshmen
that the. names of those who at-
tend the next pep meeting may be
taken and those whose names, are
found missing to be reported to
the court of control. He added that
he hoped a large attendance at fu-
ture meetings would make such
steps unnecessary. At the close of
the meeting Vogler reminded fresh-
men that they are expected to have
learned the cheers by this time.
