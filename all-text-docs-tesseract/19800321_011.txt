At the end of Winter term,
the SGA, in order to urge

PAC Chairman Tony Abbott
said student support, headed by
the SGA, as well as the PAC
recommendations, was instru-
mental in the faculty’s accept-

er “gains a new perspective on

‘observes trends of student

SGA President John Jackson
commended the faculty’s ‘‘posi-
tive response”’ as proof that
students, faculty, and admini-
stration are capable of working
together to solve a difficult
issue.

ATHLETIC POLICY

“Minor sports and phys. ed.
have suffered way too long,”
Terry said. Advocating a ‘‘fair
appropriation of funds,’’ Terry
called for a cut in football
spending.

“However, we should main-
tain current emphasis on bask-
etball,”” Terry said. ‘‘There is
potential there for making mo-
ney.”

Terry expressed concern
about spending on recruitment.
He fears that the College re-
cruits a disproportionate num-
ber of athletes from outside the
South, thereby spending on
long distance travel when stu-
dent-athletes might be recruited
more locally. He suggested a
poll be taken to see where
athletes are from.

Terry also advocated a poll of
alumni to see how they would
“respond monetarily if we cut
back on football or basketball.”

Terry wants the planned
sports complex ‘‘to cater to the
needs of student-athletes rather
than intercollegiate athletes.”
Johnston Gym is the ‘worst
facility we have on campus,”
Terry said. Its replacement
should be built with ‘‘consider-
able student input.”

When asked about changing
athletic policy, Waddill said, ‘‘I
myself don’t feel comfortable
evaluating this. It’s not a cut
and dried issue.”

Waddill said that after talk-
ing to such people as Trustee
Athletic Committee Chairman
Perrin Anderson and Faculty
Athletic Committee Chairman
David Shi, he is convinced the
matter is too complex to allow
him to recommend changes in
the football or basketball pro-
grams. ‘We need to continue to
examine this,” he said.

Waddill pointed out that gym’

facilities are ‘‘inadequate.”’
‘They couldn’t even teach a
basketball class this winter,”
~“Waddill said, because of lack of
s 4
Waddill said the planned
sport complex ought to be built
with recognition of wide de-
mand for intramural over inter-
collegiate sports. “(We need) to

push intramural participation,”
he said.

Bowie called for the college to
“concentrate its resources bet-
ter.”’ That means shifting funds
from athletics to areas such as
faculty salaries.

Bowie recommends all inter-
collegiate sports teams be
moved to NCAA Division III.
(Most are now in Division I).
“It would save money,” Bowie
said. “Also, the minor sports
could compete better.’’

Bowie favors establishment
of a committee ‘‘to investigate
whether the College is in:com-
pliance with Title IX,’’ the
federal guideline requiring e-
quity in funding men’s sports
and women’s sports.

Bowie said he supported the
College’s present emphasis on
intramurals and saw no reason
to increase involvement or
spending in that area.

ADMISSIONS POLICY

Waddill stresses the impor-
tance of getting students. invol-
ved in admissions. He points to

the Student Admissions Team —

(SAT) as one way of doing so.

The SAT, of which Waddill is
an original member, now invol-
ves about 100 students who
write letters to promising appli-
cants and sponsor Admissions
weekend. The only way in which
the SGA supports the SAT now
is by giving it money, according
to Waddill. ‘‘We can have more
recruiting weekends and get
more Davidson students invol-

Waddill favors ‘‘looking at an
equal access admissions pol-
icy.”’ ‘‘The present policy is
unacceptable,” he said.

“TI think I could come out in
favor of sex-blind admissions,”
he said. However, Waddill fears
that such a policy might be
unacceptable to the Trustees.
Thus, he said that support of a

fifty-fifty male-female ration

might be more pragmatic. ©
Waddill expressed concern
about the student-faculty ratio.
“Every year it’s gone up,” he
said. However, Waddill does
not fear a general increase in
student population. ‘‘The Tru-
stees are committed to 1300

some recruiting problems.
There may also be a problem
with morale among the coaches
and players, Frank said. ‘‘They
don’t kriow how their program
will be affected.’’ Cartmill
agreed that this is a ‘‘low
morale period for them.’’
Physical Education Director
Sterling Martin said that any
reaction now would be ‘‘prema-
ture without knowing where the
cuts are.’’ If all the cut entails
is a ‘tightening of the belt, then
I can accept that,’’ Martin said.
“Right now, I can’t say any-
thing without an itemized

» report from President Spencer.”

Women’s Sports Director Pat
Miller declined to comment on
the budget cutback.

Cartmill said that the Athlet-
ic Department will evaluate the
impact when the final cuts are
made and a report is released.
“Dean (Zimmermann) and I are
working on that now,’’ Cartmill
said.

Dear A. v. BB,

Cognizant of your political
acumen, I proffer a couple of
questions. Let me start with the
third part of my first question.
Why the hell did we not heed
the warning and build up secur-
ity around the Iranian embassy
before it was overrun by terror-
ists? Huh? Also, as a corollary
to part 2A of my second
question, why did we let the
Russians roll into Afghanistan
without a stand? Dang it!.
We've got to get tough. I’m
willing to fight for my country.

How about you, you 60-year-old

students.”

Bowie said the total student
population ‘‘doesn’t matter so
long as the student-faculty
ratio remains the same.”

Bowie advocates open admis-

sions for women uncondition-

ally.

Terry said he is ‘scared’ by
the size of the freshman class.
He wonders if a 400 student
class is a fluke or an indication
of a growing student body.

“The Commons will accomo-
date 1600 students,’’ Terry
said. Whatever policy «he Col-
lege develops about student
population, ‘‘we should have
input on it.”

Terry favors equal access
admissions. The present system
is ‘‘just plain discrimination.”
A lower male to female ratio
would be ‘‘socially much more
healthy,’’ he said.

COLLEGE MONEY
PROBLEMS

“A lack of money is hurting
Davidson most,”’ Waddill said.
“We should get students invol-
ved in the Development Office.”’

“We ‘heed to give the 1987
Program a hard look,’’ he
added. “Only thirty percent of
alumni give.”

think (an alumnus) couldn’t

A telethon would be an excel-

in fundraising, Waddill said. He
noted that a telethon his fresh-
man year (1977-78) was suc-

has had success with telethons..
