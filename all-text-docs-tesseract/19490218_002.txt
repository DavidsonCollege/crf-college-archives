Hats Off?

Orchids to the Beta senior class. Within

tiwenty-four-hours after the-start of the stu-
dent drive, every member of that class had
pledged $50 or more out of his own pocket. If

every other member of the student body
would eateh the spark of the spirit mani-
fested there, even though he might not be
able to pledge as much, the drive couldn't
fail.

Add to that spirit what we could get. from
outside sources, and we could stretch that
one-day holiday to two.

Out-of-state students have an edge on
everybody else. Alumni there will not be
reached at all for several months, maybe not
at all. Many of them would actually appre-
ciate being asked to take a part in the drive.
Most of them would be glad to help if only
somebody will contact them.

Attention Independents!

The Independents have been desig-
nated as one, of the twelve organizations
comprising the Student Campaign of the De-
velopment Program?>Once again we are faced
with the perennial problem of functioning as

an organization without an efficient admin-_

istration. We are certain, however, that we
can meet the challenge and uphold our heri-
tage as the oldest brotherhood on the campus.
Our goal for the drive is $4500. This means
a per capita contribution of about $30. Al-
though our total is high, our individual re- -
quirements are lower than those of any other
group. The reason for this is the fact that in
setting- our quota the student committee
xecognized that the Independents are on the

Inter-group competition will not be as
strong an incentive for us as for the other or-
ganizations. We might consider this to be an
advantage, since we shall not be tempted
to overshadow the real objeetive of the drive
—to build a better Davidson—with an at-
tempt to ‘‘outdo the Joneses.” Competition
is a good thing so long as we remember its
true, underlying purpose.

Letter Ts Editor

If the writer of the letter to the editor in
the February 11, 1949, issue of the’ David-
sonian who commented on the chapel pro-
vram of February 4, 1949, led by Mr. Hugh
Farrior, would have signed his name instead
of just SUA STUDENTS T could have some
respect for him. However, that personal as-
pect is not the topic of my letter.

If *‘A Student” would acquaint himself
with, first of all, Mr. Farrior, and secondly,
the facets of life, J do believe that he would
have a more complete understanding of the
whole which Mr. Farrior
ducted the devotional service.

Without taking any time to defend Mr.
Farrior (look up his reecord—it speaks for
itself) T would like to make a few comments
about what I believe to fave been a very
enlightening of some muceh-
needed information.

You (‘A Student”) mention that the talk
associated the Seriptures with lusty , and
sensual thoughts, and you continued the bal-
ance of your letter on that general theme.

Mr, Farrior used the words, ‘‘Lets see
your girl up against the
that the scriptures describes .. .’’ (or words
to that effect). In any event he did use that
particular phrase STACK UP, and I venture
to say that.it is upon those two words that
your whole conception of a lusty association
with the scriptures is based. If that is true,
you have only yourself to blame for the in-
terpretation. Granted, the- connotation that
you took is lusty and defogaory, but there
is also a former connotation of the word that
literally implies the stacking up of one set of
qualities against another to compare the
height of the two sets so as to reach conelu-
When I say
former connotation I mean before the war.
During the war your conception of the mean-
ing of the words STACK UP came into vogue.
As a veteran of that war, Mr. Farrior was
undoubtedly aware of the fact that his usage
of the phrase would attract attention to what
else he had to say, and to get that attention
(the attention that is lacking during most
chapel services) he very carefully choose
to express himself in the vernacular. Those
in the audience who have seen a little more
of life understood exactly what was meant
and jwhy the phrase was used. ,

The Bible was given’to us for a great
many reasons, paramount of which is to point
the way_to Salvation. However, not be over-
looked is the fact that in addition to the cen-
tral theme, the whole pattern of life is out-
lined and described, and remedies are given
to those people who, haying personal prob-
lems, will take time to read The Book.

Too often The Book is left lying in a con-
spicuous place for all to see, but rarely is it
used in the more intimate and practical as-
pects of life by more than just a handful of
the students here or elsewhere. The reason
being that such tied-together pictures as Mr.
Farrior presented for our elucidation are sel-
dom rendered.

If I may interpret Mr. Farrior, I'm sure
that one of his real concerns ‘vas to get
across to the students here that the Bible is
an unfathomable source of information for
answers to all of life’s perplexing questions,
and that to get that idea into the minds of
students he used the methods that-you-(““A-
Student” ) just don’t seem to comprehend.

Dear Editor:

Many years ago the accepted idea
of an education was not what it is
today for in those days the elective
system was non-existent and the
student had little or no choice con-
cerning what he would take during
his stay in college. In the past two
generations, however, the concensus
of opinion among educators -has
made the pendulum swing toward
the opposite extreme so that today
the student has almost unlimited
choice as to what he will take.

Because of the elective system the
present day college does not seem
to offer to its students any well-
Organized and integrated body of
facts. I mean that it is a simple mat-
ter for the modern student to go
through most liberal arts colleges
in the country and come out know-
ing nothing other than his own
chosen and specialized field. Thus a
student may matriculate at a college
and spend four years there and
graduate without ever knowing that
men like Plato, Rosseau, and Da
Vinci were other than famous
pedants, or that a course in Political
Science might be helpful in fulfill-
jing the coming obligations of self.

Is The Present Idea Of:
Education Satisfactory

, By R. B. DIETRICK

siderable hodgepodge of almost en-
tirely unrelated facts. Colleges now-
a-days seem to aim, if they have a
well defined aim, only at preparing
a student to make a living, and little
else. One would think that the prob-
lem of making a living, per se,
could generally be handled by voca-
tional, technical and graduate insti-
tutions, leaving the Liberal Arts
schools the task of giving the stu-
dent a broad general background in
all fields of Jearning. In this way
the student would be prepared to
specialize in any field of knowledge
after he had completed his general
education and was ready for grad-
uate school.

In some cases the present system
of college education seems to pro-
duce mass production, a-vast num-
ber of men who are slaves to their
profession through virtue of the fact
that they know almost nothing’ but
that pertaining to their chosen field.
In view of this fact, many students
and college graduates do not. feel
that they are getting or have gotten,
all that they should out of a college
education.
