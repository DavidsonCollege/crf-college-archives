Cornell Analyzes
Finance Aspects

By ED SHOAF

Editorin-Chief
Having had about a week
to orient himself to the Da-
vidson community, C. David
Cornell sat down with THE
DAVIDSONIAN and WDAV
last Wednesday to discuss

his. recent selection as Da- .

vidson's vice presidem for
finance and development.

During the interview he
discussed such issues as ris-
ing catalogue costs for Da-

»Vvidson students, the Presby-

terian Church, coeducation,
and critics of present _col-
lege change as they relate
to fund raising for David-
son.

Before responding to stu-
dent questions, Cornell dis-
cussed his role at Davidson
with primary emphasis on
this school as an actual and
potential leader in inrova-
tive educational reform.

Cornell said he felt his
position. would be enhanced
by Mavidson's fine educa-
tional reputation. He noted
in agreement with an article
in this week's Chronicle of
Higher Education that pri-
vate colleges are currently
the leaders in meaningful
educational experimentation
vand that this type of crea-
tive atmosphere is the type
favored by those controlling
large foundation grants.

Cornell also said tha the
administrative integration of
finance and development at
Davidson represents a si¢ni-
ficant positive sicp in m et

’ ing financial problems in the

financially depressed econo-
my.

“In bringing these two ele-
ments together at David-
son,"’ he said, ‘‘we have a
chance to prove to our own
constituency that the two
elements can be brought to-
gether. I would hope that we
have in Davidson a model."’

Cornell also stressed that
he saw his purpose as ‘'a
support mission supporting
the academic programs of
the college. Its only reason
for existing is to work on
and support the academic
area.”’ .

Turning to student ques-
tions, Cornell commented on
the rising costs of tuition
and fees as they related to
his work in finances.

“Generally. speaking,
throughout the country,” I
don't. see any slowdown in
the rise in tuition. Rising tui-
tion is all right as long as
you plow money back into
student aid’ he said. Cor-
nell stated Mavidson was
fortunate in having a good
balance between expenses
paid for from endowment
and tuition.

As for Davidson's financial
relationship with | the Pres-
byterian Church, Cornell
said, “I think the contact of
the church is more than fin-
arcial.

‘The o'her thnigs we gain
from association with the
church ave very important.

Eating Proposal Probed

AN ANALYSIS
By GRAY WILSON

Asst. Managing Editor

Is it legally defensible for

,a fraternity to eat as a
group off campus?
_ A challenge may be de-
veloping for next year as
several fraternities consider
the desirability of maintain-
_ing dining facilities off cam-
pus.

Housing committees have
been organized in some of
the fraternities, and legal
loopholes are among the al-
ternatives to the new social

program which are being
discussed.
In the trustees’, decision

last October on carapus so

Same — in peace or war
in depression or inflation.
‘“‘We hasten to add, how-
ever,’ that Jackson's contri-
butions to the life of the col
lege are by no means re-
stricted to the monetary.
‘But, be it said that first
of all, Jackson gave his own
life to Davidson, with the in-
inner loyalty of his
heart. For all these things,
Davidson will ever be grate-
ful.”’

cial life, Section 7 plainly
states: ‘Any fraternity which
wishes to leave Patterson

2@Gourt and have its meetings

elsewhere may do. 80, ‘80
long as its meeting place
does not include the opera-
tion of living or dining facil-
ities.”

According to College Pres-
ident Samuel R. Spencer Jr.,
this section was the. only
stipulation added by the
trustees in ‘‘committee dis-
cussion” of the original pro-
posal.

Spencer added that there
have been problems in the
past over dining facilities
when fraternities were off
campus, but that the situa-
tion was remedied with the
completion of Patterson
Court in 1958. 55

Vice-preisdent for Acade-
mic Affairs John M. Bevan
suggested that a modified
social system with on and
off campus dining might not
be economically feasible if
some fraternity houses were
left vacant on the court.

Bevan said, ‘‘I believe that
small student group living
is extremely important here
and nobody should be denied.
It is one of the best things
we have.

“But if they eat off cam-
pus as a fraternity group of
Davidson College, it is a
challenge to the Board of

Trustees action. We have to
accept the challenge. If they
test it, we’H test it. There
is_no other alternative."

Just last year 20 ‘“‘indi-
viduals,” nationals who left
the Sigma Chi house when
it voted to become a local
chapter, maintained dining
facilities in a local boarding
house in full knowledge of
the administration.

There have been several
legal precedents set in re-
gard to in loco  parentis
suits filed by fraternal or-
ganizations against a college.

The most popular court
battle occurred in Septem-
ber, 1881 when Delta Delta
Chapter of Sigma Chi chal-
lenged. Purdue _ University
over the fraternity issue.
College President Emerson
E. White, backed by the fac-
ulty, had refused to enroll

“any student who associated

himself with any of the acti-
vities of a fraternity.

A test case developed when
a fraternity member who
left college in the preceding
year applied for readmis-
sion in the fall. He was re-
jected because of his frater-
nity status.

‘On June 21, 1882 the In-
diana Supreme Court upheld
the lawsuit, stating that ‘‘the
faculty. has no right. to har
anyone from classes on the
fraternity issue.”

trustees, I think. the social

‘system should be reevaluat-

ed by the senate.”

ticipating .in an advisory
capacity on the Admissions
Committee, charging a small
admission fee to student
concerts, and publicizing

and committee reports can-
not be railroaded through."’

Jody Turner is another
senate veteran, and he has
Served on the Onter‘Frater-
nity Council. A North Caro-
lina Fellow, he worked for
Congressman Richardson
Preyer last summer.

‘Paraphrasing John Dewey,

Turner stated that, ‘‘‘Educa- —

tion should not be prepara-
tion for life, but life itself,’
Everything .at Davidson,

from social activities to stu-
dent government, should be
a part of education.”

On fraternities, Turner
feels that the trustees ‘‘will
not reverse their decision
without’ seeing it work for
awhile, With such a situa-
tion, it’s going to take open,
imaginative
make the best of it.’’ —

Turner added that ‘‘nation-
al fraternities should be al-
lowed to move off campus
‘if they desire.’’

In place of the SGA, he
wants ‘‘a governing council
for the entire school, com-
posed of equal numbers of
representatives from the ad-

stration, faculty, and
students. All other  acade-
mic, legislative, and judici-
cal bodies will be subordi-

thinking to

nate to this council.’’
Turner seeks curriculum
changes for ‘‘more interdis- &
ciplinary courses and ma-
jors, and a predaw major.”
He feels the college has
been ‘dragging its feet on
coeducation. There are a
number of small steps it
could be taking to speed
that time.”

Greg Sikes is wary of the
misleading nature of polici-
cal campaigns, and he is
motivated as a candidate by
his: desire to reopen the
question of fraternities.

He has participated in
varsity football and basket-
ball, and is a member of
the YIMCA and the Associa-
tion of Christian Athletes.

Sikes believes an agree-
able settlement can be
reached by all the parties

involved on Patterson Court.
“‘T see no reason why a com-
promise on fraternities
would not be economically
and_ socially feasible. The
freshmen are the ones who
have been really hurt.”

He hopes .to revamp the
SGA if elected. ‘‘The 'way
things have been going late-
ly I think its time the SGA
was put on a more realis-
tic basis.

“J think it should repre-
sent the whole student body,
and recently the campus
has been subject to the
workings of a group of pro-
fessional politicians:”’

Sikes favors student  re-

' presentation on the Admis-

sions .Committee, and he
thinks the SGA should pub-
licize itself more in THE
DAVIDSONIAN.
