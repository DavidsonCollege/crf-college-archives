College Trustees
deny professors

10% salary raise

By KIRBY OWEN.
Staff Writer

After postponing the decision
for over a month, the College
Trustees did not approve the
faculty's request for a ten
percent salary increase at their
special meeting Saturday. In-
stead, they provided for an
overall salary increase of seven
percent.

The increase was within Pres-
ident Carter's guidelines for
wage and price stability. ‘It
seems neither wise nor desirable
to break with the rest of the
educational community and op-
enly defy President Carter's
program... Davidson has a duty
to promote both exemplary
citizenship and_ scholarship,”
according to a Trustee state-
ment issued to the faculty.

Professor Brown Patterson,
chairman of the Professional
Affairs Committee (PAC), said,
‘We'd asked for ten percent, so
we're very disappointed. With
an inflation rate of nine percent,

we're continuing to lose
ground.”
Academic Vice-President

Price Zimmermann noted, “It
does seem as if inflation will be
higher than predicted, but in
terms of other small private
colleges, our scales are very
competitive. There are certain
advantages to Davidson that
aren't calculated in the official
compensation rate, such as
housing, summer research mon-
ey, etc.”

Patterson admitted Davidson
salaries are competitive, but,
“We're not at the top of our
list,"" he said. He argued that
Davidson's competition for stu-
dents is not with small northern
liberal arts colleges but with
Duke, Chapel Hill, and Wake
Forest, who are ‘‘all ahead of us
in faculty compensation,’’ he
said.

When these institutions bid
for the same faculty members
as we do, they can offer them a
higher salary,"’ he said.

Zimmermann pointed out
that the Trustees have four
ways to provide for faculty
salary increases. First, income
from Davidson's endowment
can be increased through better
management. Second, tuition
can be increased. Third, money
from gifts can be increased by
raising the goals for Living
Endowment. And fourth, the
Division I basketball program
can be eliminated.

Commenting on the fourth
option,

‘The Trustees have determined
that the effort to regain national
prominence in basketball is to
continue; hoping that if the
seam becomes successful, gate
revenues will pay for"the prog-

$200 deposit required for re-entry

By MARK BARRETT
Asst. News Editor

Students choosing to leave
Davidson before they graduate
may find it a little harder to get
back in.

According to Registrar Ri-
chard Burts, students leaving
the College temporarily will
either have to pay a-:$200
deposit or reapply. They may

also not be able to return in the

fall term.

The changes, which tighten
former ‘‘stopping procedures,”
were made by an ad hoc
committee of administrators in
late March.

Beginning immediately, stu-
dents who decide to take off

from Davidson will have to pay
a $200 deposit to reserve a place
for them when they return,
Burts said. In the past, no
deposit was required.

The other change dictates
that students whose leave be-
gins with a spring or winter
term will be allowed to return to
Davidson only at the beginning
of a spring or winter term:
Students whose leaves begin
with fall terms will still be free
to return when they wish.
Before, all students on leave
were allowed to end their leave
when they wanted.

Students will still be required
to specify which term they will

Self-scheduling here to stay

Faculty passes all recommendations
with only minor changes in wore

By JIM GARRETT
News Editor
With “‘no opposition’ Tuesday, faculty: members ‘ “aati
approval of self-scheduled exams” with minor administrative
-stipulations, according to Academic Affairs Vice-President Price

Zimmermann.

Zimmermann said faculty approval was based on “evidence that
students take self-scheduling and the Honor Code quite seriously.”
He added ‘‘faculty members were influenced by student parce 954
and recommitment to do what is necessary to make self.
exams work: That is, not cheating, and turning in offenders.”

Five major administrative
stipulations were approved by
the faculty. First, all exams
must be given on days desig-
nated as exam days. Second,
individual faculty members are
authorized to distribute and to
collect their own exams, if they
so please. Third, the Registrar
will continue to distribute and
to collect exams as in the past.
Fourth, all special exams _ re-
quiring audio-visual equipment
must be authorized by the Dean

of Faculty, and fifth, a complete
re-evaluation of self-scheduling
is planned for the fall of 1981.

Zimmermann noted that ‘‘for
self-scheduled exams to work
the context must include a vig-
orous Honor Code.”

“With student commitment
and significant faculty approv-
al, self-scheduled exams have
great educational merit,’’ he
added.

This is the first time that the
self-scheduled exam system has
actually been approved by the
faculty, since it was started ex-
perimentally eight years ago.

The faculty's decision to ap-
prove the self-scheduled exam
system ends a two-month long
controversy.

Students showed their con-
cern by attending a series of
forums: and open ends on the
matter.

Earlier the faculty defeated a
proposal which would have
allowed professors to schedule
their own exams without having

Tentative site
for Commons

By JIM GARRETT

Physical Plant Director Gro-
ver Meetze erased doubt over
the location of the campus
commons when he announced
recently that it will definitely be
located where Richards and
Bailey are now:

“This is the ideal site for the |
Commons,” Meetze said, but
added, ‘‘We must begin by
relocating Richards and: Bailey.
as well as the power lines
running across’ Patterson
Court.”

Bailey and Richards are “to
moved this summer so that
construction of the Commons
can begin next fall. Bailey will
be relocated between F & M and
ETC while Richards will be
relocated between Rusk and
PAX.

“Renovation of the land be-
tween F & M and ETC and
between Rusk and PAX is our
first concern,’’ said Meetze.

Both Richards and Bailey will
be available for next year’s
incoming freshmen in their new
locations, according to Meetze.

He noted that the power lines
will be relocated north of Pat-
terson Court to allow for the
new Commons.

Many middle-income students now eligible for federal education grants

The Carter Administration and Congress

have reacted to the rising costs of a college
education. At the close of its second session
the 95th Congress
passed the Middle In-

come Student Assis- Focus
tance Act (MISAA), on the
a bill increasing the News

eligibility of many
students to receive
the various forms of student assistance.

‘ Kathleen Stevenson, Assistant Director
—3f Pinane** Aid at Day
bill was in response to the awareness by

idsgn, stated “the ~

Congress that the middle income families
need attention.”” From 1967 to 1976 the
average cost of a college education rose 77
percent, a jump so high that many middle
income families now lack the resources
necessary for the child’s college education.

The 1.46 billion dollar student benefit
package passed by Congress would increase
money now available by some 3.8 billion to
5.2 billion dollars, an increase of 40 percent.
This money, would provide Basic Educatio-
nal Opportunity Grants (BEOG's) to 3.1
million additional students and guarantee a
$250 grant to 2.8 million students whose
families earn between $16,000 and $25,000
annually.

The bill will also aid the College Work

students, raising the total to over one
million students. Of this million about
380,000 will be from families above the
$16,000 dollar income level.

The Act also affected the Guaranteed
Student Loan Program. Seventy million
dollars is earmarked to provide expanded.
eligibility for guaranteed loans to families
in the $16,000 to $45,000 income range.

HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano. Jr..
stated, ‘President Carter is committed to
increasing student financial aid for middle
income families with children in college.”

Stevenson did not know exactly | how
many Davidson students be affected
by the bill. However, she stated students
would be informed of the changes: and
