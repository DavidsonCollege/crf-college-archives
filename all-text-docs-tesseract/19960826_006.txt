This summer, I spent close to
a month living in London by my-
self. I organized my trip in this
manner: I rented a flat, bought my
ticket and left. My parents couldn’t
comprehend why I wanted to go
alone. “Take your brother or go
with a friend,” they said. I didn’t
feel as if I were being incredibly
daring going to London alone. I
was born there, lived there, spent
the semester abroad there, so it
wasn’t as if I would land there and
have no idea what to do. An aside,
having attended boarding school,
this was the first time in seven
- years that I had lived at home. I
was willing to purchase a one-way
ticket to Chad to escape Connecti-
cut and I certainly wanted to be
alone.
I can’t say that I had an
intinerary when I arrived. I imag-
ine that this was subconscious re-

They began scolding me al-
most as soon as I arrived at
Magdelene College for Davidson’s
Summer Programme in Cam-
bridge, two days late. Carol: “Iam
amazed. This has never happened
before. We’ve never had a
Davidson student like this before.”
While she counted to ten, Alison,
Davidson’s other British liason,
controlled herself and merely said:
“We're glad that you’ve arrived
safely, Teresa. [deep breath] Fi-
nally. [deeper breath] We’re look-
ing forward to your explanation.”

And so I told for the first time
the tale of How Teresa Loses Her
Passport and Finds an Irish Wed-
ding (sponsored in part by the Dean
Rusk Program).

Ithad been nearly a week since
[arrived in Britain in order to study
British univeristy newspapers and
meet with a few editors, and after
seven days of travelling alone with-
out (major) mishap, I was feeling

actionary behavior on my part be-
cause my last voyage to Britain
was in the company of Larry Ligo,
a man for whom itinerary is fun.
Although I loved my art history
semester from beginning to end,
this trip was going to be rather
more relaxed. A few of my loosely
delineated goals were to see my
beloved paintings, buy alot of shoes
and read for my thesis.

It is this reading that brings
me a bit closer to my point. I had
decided that I would read some of
the classics of feminist scholar-
ship. I was terribly ashamed that,
as a woman, I had not read de
Beauvoir or Greer or Millet. So I
read and I got angry. Even though
I have called myself a feminist
always, it has been to challenge
people’s conceptions of the ste-
reotypical feminist. In other words,
I defined myself as a feminist to

particularly proud of myself. Hav-
ing spent the morning studying
several old issues of Trinity Col-
lege, Dublin’s, Trinity News, Icon-
gratulated myself again as I just
caught the noon train to Limerick.
“Ah, yes, Teresa. Rising bright
and early and getting the job done.
Yes, Teresa, good job. You’re
definitely getting it right.” Two
hours later I realize that I’ve left
my passport, my BritRail pass, my
traveler’s checks, and my plane
tickets home atthe hostel in Dublin.

_So the next morning I hunt
down some old issues of Limerick
University’s An Focal and head to
the train station to buy my ticket
back to Dublin, and I think about
the James Joyce I’ve read where
the characters try and try to leave
that suction city and just end up
drowning in the struggle. While
waiting in line at the information
desk, I meet the three guys in line
behind me, who were obviously

eradicate the negative connotation
that the word carries. This sum-
mer, I learned that when I said I
was a feminist, I meant it.

As I walked through my fa-
vorite city, I became aware of
myself as a person but more aware
of myself as a woman. Men stare at
women who are alone. I had never
noticed stares before. I feltashamed
of myself and uncomfortable. I
thought that if I changed clothes
the stares would stop. I put on
jeans and an oxford shirt. No
change. This led me to believe that
the lecherous stares were less about
sex than they were about hege-
mony and appraisal. Men’s gazes
are proprietary and they are terri-
torial. It is not because of what
women wear, our breast size, our
hair or eye color, or body. My
experiences are the product of a
long and complicated dynamic.

Therelationship between woman’ s
sexual power and man’s desire to
harness and subdue that power
became apparent to mie as being
present in my life.

I came to realize this through
experiencing the comparative ano-
nymity of a city where it is possible
to look but not touch and move on
and remain anonymous.

I suppose that I tried to ignore
staring in the past or maybe I just
didn’t understand the meaning be-
hind the gazes. But when alone,
stares are harder to ignore and they
are frightening.

Iread more and walked every-
where until I was so angry that I
began to take taxis. But that did not
help. And it was expensive. So I
walked everywhere again and and
I finally experienced my catharsis.
I was in Grosvenor Square in front
of the American Embassy, a mere

Justin, the Crow Indian. Patrick,
the I-wish-I-was-Irish-man. Rob.
They’re from Connecticut. “Next
please,” the big grumpy man calls.
My train leaves intwohours. Their
train to Cork also leaves in two
hours. We go for lunch together.
Patrick invites me to his cousin’s
wedding. What?

“I’m serious. Come to the
wedding. My Uncle Sean, man,
he’s so cool. And my cousins
Nessa and Julie — Julie’s the one
getting married — I hung with
them all last summer. Super-cool.
Nessa has this hair... and my Uncle
Jerry. He’s like an Irish hick, can’t
understand a word he says. But
they all love Americans. Serious,
come with us.” And so I do.

We traveled travel to Cork on
a train full of drunk Irishmen sing-
ing old rebel songs and then to
Innishannon, the closest town with
a bed and breakfast to Castlhack,

the hamlet of 12 where Patrick’s
family lives (almost half the popu-
lation). Patrick’s Uncle Sean, Aunt
Teresa, and cousin Nessa invited
us over and spent the evening feed-
ing us, telling story after story,
doling out Irish Cream, and letting |
us marvel at Nessa’s magnificent
hair, blond and curly and uncon--
trollable.

I went to Julie’s wedding the
next day and tried to kneel and
stand appropriately, tried to figure
out what I did’t understand be-
cause it was in Gaelic and what I
didn’t understand because of the
priest’s thick brogue. And then at
the reception I met Uncle Jerry and
the rest of the O’Calaghans and
some of the O’Sullivans of the
groom’s side. And then I was
complemented on my dancing for
the first time in my life. And then
I camped with Patrick, Justin, and
Rob on a hillside overlooking
Kinsale harbor and fell asleep un- .
der a clear sky and full moon.

In Dublin I found Joyce’s re-
curring nightmares. In Kinsale I
found Yeats’ echoing dreams.

was good bus service on Sundays.
I had to wait until afternoon to
catch the bus into Cork to catch the
train to Dublin where I retrieved
my passport and ran to the dock in
time to watch the last ferry to En-
gland pull away. I spent that night
in the ferry station with a bum
named Mick who made his money
by breathing fire. I finally arrived

block from my flat. A revolting
individual came up to me and told
me his plans for our evening to-
gether. That was it. With feminism
acting as my aegis, I screamed at
him. Imanaged some coherent and
lucid sentences, then lapsed into
profanity and ended with a tidy
idiomatic epithet that was lost on
no one there, least of all the visa
applicants lining up outside the
embassy. I felt so much better.

So, I learned that the cliché-
ridden domain of angry feminism
is also my own sphere. My anger
hastened the coalescence of a lot of
my own fragmented ideas, con-
cepts that, I believe, are present at
least in embryonic form in all
women.

I wrote this down a week ago
for the freshmen orientation issue,
but if you're not a freshmen or don't
feel particurlarly unoriented I still
would ask you to read on. You see,
I didn't feel comfortable playing the
shaman for 450 strangers who know
as much about what to expect from
a new year as I do.

However, I do feel comfort-
able playing the storyteller, and if
you care to listen then please gather
round. :

Last year, I found myself be-
tween two friends in the parking lot
of Harris Teeter’s. Actually, we were
standing by the entrance_in an at-
tempt to stay out of the drizzle which
threatened to spoil our formal attire.
We were chatting about something
which escapes me now, waiting.

An older woman pushed her
cart out the doors and began slide-
stepping her way down the slick cart
ramp into the chilled night. watched
her for a moment and lost interest.
But one of my friends did not. Un-
asked, he sprang from his dry perch
where he had been enjoying a ciga-
rette and stepped towards the woman
saying “let me help you with that,
ma’am.” She was reluctant at first,
but in moments he had the cart in his
hands and they were locked in a
conversation. After placing the gro-
ceries in her trunk, he helped her
into the car and waved goodbye.
Then he pushed the cart back up the
ramp and reclaimed his post next to
us. We said nothing.

After lighting up a fresh ciga-
rette and taking a slow drag off it he
offered one simple and amazing
explanation for his actions. “I al-
ways try to leave people with a
smile.” That was all.

That doesn't have anything to
do with orientation, that's why you
are seeing it now, but since that
night it has had much to do with lif
for me. The woman at the grocery,
she did smile.
