Davidsonian 1958-59: Our Policy

Now that the 1958-59 DAVIDSON-
IAN is officially a thing of the past,
we who have edited it can look back
over the last eleven months and eval-
uate the policy of editorial opinion
that we have tried to express in these
pages.

Both in our proposals for con-
crete, immediate action on specific
matters, and in the general principles
we have set forth concerning issues
of long-range importance, we have
tried to frame our editorial policy ac-
cording to an over-all conception of
what is best for Davidson, now and
in the future.

DEFINITE STAND
In so doing, we have not tried to

fit into the existing mold of student,
faculty, administration, or trustee
Opinion, but have called the shots as
we saw them. This is not the way
to elicit universal agreement, but we
have felt that a vigorous policy that
took a definite stand and did not
hesitate to criticize was preferable to
one which straddled the fence, at-
tempted to please everybody, and ul-
stimatclysaid nothing.

In student government activities,
we first advocated making the fire-
arms rule a part of the Student Body
Constitution and enforcing it by sus-
pension from college; this was sub-
sequently voted into the constitution.
We supported John Kuykendall’s
Honor Court plan, which is now a
permanent part of student govern-
ment. We have also called for the end
of the- Court of Control.

In fraternity and IFC matters, we
have called for a system of preferen-
tial bidding, a re-evaluation and re-
vision of Rush Week, and a Greek
Week to replace Hell Week, and we
have supported and encouraged the
present IFC in its efforts in these
areas. However, only the Rush Week
modifications can be said to have
worked successfuly, and a preferen-
tial bidding system and a really Hell-
less Greek Week should be the first
order ‘of business for the new IFC.

STRENGTHEN, NOT DESTROY

We. have attempted to point out
weak leadership where it existed, not
to destroy organizations but to
strengthen them. We hope that next
year’s YMCA President and Cabinet
will work vigorously to restore the
“Y™ 1o its former position of respect
and usefulness. Such ideas as the
book-and-author program, which
failed to get off the ground this year,
would be a step in the right direction.

In athletic policy, we have op-
posed any attempts to increase the
proportion of the scholarship fund
used for football and basketball schol-
arships, and have proposed, as an ulti-

mate ideal for Davidson, a league of
schools operating on a completely
non-subsidized basis.

Moving out of the sphere of stu-
dent life, we have advocated a con-
sistent, progressive policy to strength-
en Davidson’s educational position in
the future.

Specifically, we have urged that
“not a single student above the pres-
ent number should be added until
the size of the faculty has been in-
creased and at least one new dormi-
tory built,” that the present religious
requirements for faculty members
should be relaxed, that the “unwrit-
ten rules” restricting a professor’s
freedom to experiment and make in-
ovations in his teaching methods
should be done away with, and that
some system of unlimited cuts for
students should be adopted.

QUALITY EDUCATION
Much of our concern about the

quality of Davidson's education has
centered on the question of the cur-
riculum. We have stated before, and
still believe, that much dead wood
could be cut out of the required
freshman and sophomore courses,
and that the junior and senior years
could be strengthened by such de-
vices as comprehensive major tests, a
senior thesis requirement, and more
honors work. a

Finally, we have called for serious
study of the question of admission of
Negro students to Davidson. “Any
defenses erected to keep qualified
Negro students out of Davidson
must be .. . rationally untenable,” we
said. This is a problem that will con-
tinue to cause confusion and uncer-
tainty until brought dut into the open
and decided according to the stan-
dards of religion and morality which
the college officially professes.

WHAT SHOULD BE

In all of this, we have been moti-
vated. not by a desire merely to criti-
cize what is, but to recommend what
should be. We think that Davidson is
a college with great promise for the
future, greater than many here
imagine: but that her present achieve-
ment is sadly below what some think
it is. The means for improvement
exist, however: an able and forward-
looking president, a basically good
faculty, adequate financial resources,
and a generally capable student body.

All that is lacking is a certain
awareness of what Davidson could
really accomplish as a leader among
American liberal arts colleges.

The ultimate purpose of this
year’s editorial policy has been to
stimulate more thoughts leading to-
ward decision and action among those
who are finally responsible for the
future of Davidson.

A Word of Sincere Appreciation

It is with difficulty that we realize
the DAVIDSONIAN appears for the
last time with the current masthead.
The new Editor will be selected next
‘week, and he and his new staff will
publish their first issue following
Spring Holidays.

Space will not permit the naming
of every man who has contributed to
the DAVIDSONIAN of 1958-59, but
the Editor wishes to express to each
of them his deepest appreciation for
time, talent, and effort unselfishly
given.

At the risk of sounding unduly
sentimental, we must say that the
most valuable experiences gained
from three years with this paper are
fhe friendships made in association
with members of the staff. No cam-
pus organization offers more oppor-
tunifies for throughly getting to know

individuals and appreciating their
abilities than work on this, or any
college paper.

A word of thanks goes also to the
administration, the Publications
Board, and our faculty advisor who
have all co-operated in giving us both
the resources and the rein to allow
the creation of the type paper we
felt present needs called for.

Finally, we can. state without
qualification that next year’s paper
will be in good hands, and should
egual and probably excel the quality
of our product. All three of the can-
didates for Editor have proved them-
selves to be extremely dependable,
talented, and fully able to edit this
paper in a superior fashion.

With this note we shall become,
as we began. an avid reader of the
DAVIDSONIAN.

IFC Replies To Newspaper’s
Statements On Greek Week

Dear Editor:

It is evident from some opin-
ions and statements that ap-
peared in last week's DAVID-
SONIAN that there is a vast
gap between the interpretation
by the Interfraternity Council
and by certain students of what
a first attempt at a Greek
Week should be in order to be
termed a success.

Admittedly, the resolution
made last year which this year’s
IFC supported was very vague
in nature and left a lot of loop-
holes of interpretation which
could be turned into abuse of
the ideal of Greek Week.

More conerete rules need
to be made and shall be mado
for next year. However, the
IFC does not wish, and has
never wished, to outlaw any-
thing simply for the sake of
practicing legislation.

As the representative body of
the fraternity system, the IFC
has attempted to do two things
in Greek Week: 1. To estab-
lish the tradition of the use of
community projects to help
build pledge class spirit and,
as a by-product, create favor-
able relations with the rest of
the school and community, and

‘2. To remove those traditions

which are not justifiable on
the basis of the good of the
practice per se or the spirit

LETTER TO EDITOR

they . create, which practices
may be substituted by more
suitable, acceptable, and ef-
fective means.

Among the list of unac-
ceptable practices are such
things as all-night vigils, road
trips, the eating of very un-
palatable substances, eg9
throwing, and sack wearing.

-It is true that some of the
unacceptable traditions made
their appearance in Greek
Week. But to say that the pres-
ence of a vestige of Hell Week
is logical grounds for the con-
clusion that the first attempt
at Greek Week was an utter
failure is either to forget the
matter of degree or to define
utter failure as the failure to
attain one’s ultimate goal in
a single attempt. What upper-
classman, having gone through
Hell Week in the past, cannot

admit that many, and perhaps
virtually all, of the most odious
pre-initiation practices were ab-
sent in Greek Week?

Besides, the positive side
has not been considered.
Many projects were success-
fully carried out, both from
the standpoint of real ac-
complishment and from the
standpoint of building pledge
class spirit. This fact should
not be forgotten.

In evaluating Greek Week, a
few other factors should be

kept in mind also. First, in
many cases spontaneous actions
by pledge classes and other in-
dividuals Jed to situations which
evoked criticism. It would be
very difficult to curtail such
spontaneity completely, espe-
cially when it originates with
the pledges themselves.

As for the long infirmary list,
it will probably always be with
us, enlarged by a few “free-
loaders,” of course, but others
really sick or injured. One
should be careful about blam-
ing it all on hazing, however.
Is not the trampoline still in
in use?

Finally, it might be good
to realize that neither Rome
nor Davidson were built in a
day. Change will take time,
if for no other reason than
that fraternity men must
learn how to handle and lead

a Greek Week. The experi-
ence of one year will be val-
vable to the next.

Was Greek Week such a fail-
ure after all, then? The IFC, as
the representative of fraternity
opinion; says “no.” This is not
by any means to say that the
goal of the Greek Week idea
has been reached. It is to say
that a step has been taken in
the right direction, be it ever
so faltering, as its critics may
portray it.

The Interfraternity Council

Senior Defends Greek Week As
“Real Step In Right Direction’

Dear Editor:

I read your editorial of last
week with great interest. I can
not say that I agree with you.

NEW GENERATION

Certainly, you saw traces of
Hell Week in the Greek Week
just ended. Did you really ex-
pect an entirely different gen-
eraion of offspring when
three-fourths of the original pa-
rents are still around to raise
this new generation?

Is the IFC to act as a police
force for over 900 people? I
think not! The Individual fra-
ternity member must govern
himself, for, to use an analogy,
“a chain is only as strong as
its weakest link.”

HELPFUL PROJECTS

While you were looking
around during Greek Week did

PEANUTS

you overlook the smiles of joy
and gratitude of those helped
through various fraternity pro-

jects throughout the communi-
ty? Did you see boys going
without sleep for almost three
days? Did you see boys keep-
ing fires burning all night,
boys wearing the exact same
clothes and croaker sack for a
week. Did you see one or even
two pledges coming in from
road trips Sunday?

My own advice would be for
you to keep in mind a state-
ment that Theodore Roosevelt
made fifty some odd years ago.
He said, “It is not the critle
who counts, not the man who
points out how the strong man
stumbled or where the doer of
deeds could have done them
better. The credit belongs to

the man who is actually in the
arena; whose face is marred
by dust and sweat and blood;
who strives valiantly; who errs
and comes short again and
again; who knows the great en-
thusiasms, the great devotions
and spends himself in a worthy
cause; who, at best, knows the
triumph of high achievement;
and who, at the worst, if he
fails, at least fails while daring
greatly, so that his placé shall
never be with those cold end
timid souls who know neither
victory nor defeat.”

I think all of us here at Da-
vidson can use this advice. If
we fail, whether it be in sports,
campus activities, or in the
classroom, we will have the con-
solation of knowing that we
failed “while daring greatly.”

"This Is Goodbye,

Chief’: Kernan

By TOM KERNAN

| trudged up the steps to the second floor of the
Union and fought my way through crowds of copy-boys,
ad-men, stool pigeons, and ambulance chasers, all en-
grossed in the task of getting out this week’s DAVID-

SONIAN.

} made it to the editor's office, sneaked past the
armed spearmen at the door, and located the sheet’s
genial editor, ‘“Larns” Walker, engaged in thrashing a
young reporter with a copy of Webster's Unabridged.

“Hello Chief,” | said.

He released the reporter, told him to stand in the
corner, and offered me a seat on the edge of his desk.
“What have you got for me this week, Boy Hack?” he

asked.

“Nothing, Chief,” | replied, “absolutely nothing. Out
of ideas. This is our last stand, though; the elections will
cleanse this journalistic temple and you and I will be

free-lancers again.”

He smiled nostalgically and leaned back in his chair.
Patton came through the office, passing out cigars. (This
is done every time a new DAVIDSONIAN is born.) “Larns”
and I lit up our stogies, but Chastain started unravelling
his with philosophical detachment until only a pile of
shreds was left. “Nothing there,” he said, smiling bitter-
ly, “I suspected it all along.” He sighed, took out a pen-
cil and pad, and started jotting down notes about the

condition of the cigar.

“Fine analytical mind, that Charley,” Larns whis-
pered to me. “Been a great help to me this year.”

“Yes,” | said, “it’s been a great year, Chief. You've
been the dynamic leader of a fine-staff, and —” I paused.
Tears were rolling down his cheeks. I. choked up with

emotion.

“Damn cigar,” he gasped. “Patton, these *!”* cigars
make my eyes water. Go get some nickel ones; hang the

expense.”

“Who's the kid you’re punishing?” | asked.

“That's Clark Salem,” said Larns. “He keeps run-
ning into closets and stripping down to his red under-
wear and a cape. Can’t break him of it.”

“Never make a journalist,” | said gloomily. “Well,

this is goodbye, Chief.”

We shook hands and | left. | spent the rest of the
night at the local nautical restaurant in the company of
such notables as: Godfrey Cringe, Boris Treadway, Harry
Ferlips, Clyde Whiffle and Cinderella Gummidge, Winston
Small, Euphemia Bullard and many more who enjoyed
performing for you this year in “The Spectator.”

THE PHILOSOPHES

“Only Deadline Is .
Getting Dead’

By DABNEV STUART

Robert Frost said some of
his poems in Chapel Hill last
Friday.

On Sunday I received the fol-
lowing letter:

“His last poem was ‘Reluc-
tance’ and the last words were
the ones: ‘. . . bow and accept
the end of a love or a season.’
He said that he likes to study
trees and the way branches go
off into the sky in so many
directions, and then he read
about the tree at my window,
window tree.

“He said that he likes to
go out at night after twelve
o’clock to get the house and
the books out of his head end
then he read about the dog
Sirius who came into the
house as he was opening the
door to go out to look at
the constellations — end
about the meaning there that
he was supposed to seek, end
finding wasn't supposed to
speek,

“When he was young, he
said, he admired old people
very much, especially old la-
dies.

“He read the one about be-
ing and not being alone and
when he finished he went back
and read the words ‘. . . from
sheer morning gladness at the

brim . . .’ because this is why
poems are written. This is even
one definition of a poem, he
said.

“He read ‘Stopping by
Woods’ and said that it
wasn't about death, but about
reluctance, like the one by
that name — he said, ‘You've
got to watch out these days
about symbols — you know,
everybody's . . .’ and then
trailed off.

“And he read “The Death of
the Hired Man,’ stumbling oft-
en, hesitating after he had re-
peated a long section by mem-
ory and lost his place. ‘I’m not
seeing too well,’ then he put
on his glasses.

“He talked about education
alot and said that the particu-
Jar thing about his theory of
education was (he'd just
thought of this tonight. he said)
that there was no call for
thoughts of a deadline, in his
system anyway.

“The wey he teachos a
class is to just start talke
ing about something and have
his students sit on « plece
of paper, and when they
thought of an idea ‘ss is an
idee’ to take out the paper
and write it down.

“He doesn't believe in fore
ing anything, he said — about
five of those pieces of paper
during the year would be
enough. And he never uses a
red pencil. If he ‘responds’ to
what has been written he turns
the paper over and writes on
the back of it. ‘That defines
my idea about the education
thing.’

“He said there was no dead-
line in bis life except ‘getting
dead.’”
