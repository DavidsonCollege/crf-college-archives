Kitchen installation surprises Belk

By JIM ENTWISTLE

Students living on fourth
Belk returned this year to find
an addition to their hall—a
new kitchén. This facility, in-
stalled over the summer in the
storage room, contains a
stove, sink and ample counter
and cabinet space.

“This was a_ pleasant
surprise for all of us. We had
no idea that a kitchen would
be installed over the summer,”’
said one Belk resident.

The SGA Senate has initi-
ated a new communications
program between the Senate
and the stydent body.

“The communications pro-
gram was set up for two main
reasons,’ explained SGA Sen-
ator Hans Watford, who, al-
ong with SGA Vice-President
Steve Cuffe and Senator Tony
Snow, is serving on a Com-
munications Committee that
runs the system.

“First, it allows Senators to
get information about Senate
activities to the students in a
more regular and direct basis,
and second, it’allows students
to let the Senate know what
they want done,” he said.

The system works on a three
week cycle. The first week all
of them are given a computer
print out list of about forty
students. During the week the
Senators are supposed to see
everyone on their list and ask
him for any complaints, ideas
or interests. If'they do have a
response, they are given a card
which records their problem
in triplicate. The Senator
takes this card back to the
Senate meeting the next week
where it is channeled into the
proper Senate committee for
action.

During the second week the
committee members investi-

Vice President Steve Cuffe,”

and the college administra-
tion. Last year, the RHC
conducted a _ survey of
students to determine what
dormitory improvements were
necessary.

The installation of addition-
al kitchens was ranked second
behind the installation of a
Telecentrex phone system, but
since the Telecentrex system
was not feasible for two years,
the RHC went ahead and
began to plan for kitchen
installations.

gate the responses on the
cards and after recording com-
plete and detailed answers,
return them to the Senator
receiving the response.

Then during the third week
the Senator returns to the
student who gave the response
and inform him of the progress
being made.

After the three week cycle is
complete the Senators receive
a new list of names and the
process begins again.

Visitation for this week
have already been turned in to
the Senate. Watford termed
the program ‘‘very success-
ful’, but he clarified success
by saying ‘‘a lot depends on
how successful we-can be in
dealing with the problems and
ideas.”

He added that participation
in the program was close to
100 percent.

“The vast majority of prob-
lems this week dealt with the
broad problem of overcrowd-
ing,” he said.

“Some people expressed a
concern about getting a room
next year.”’

Watford said that both stu-
dent and Senate response had
been good. ‘All the Senators
had done their job on time.

“Student response was also
good. They really seem to like
the idea of as getting back to
them with concern for their
problem.”

Kitchens were originally
planned for fourth Belk and
fourth Little, but finances
prevented the construction so
it was decided to try for one
new kitchen a year for the next
several years, with the first to
be in Belk.

“Getting this kitchen
installed took a lot of work and
a lot of going back and forth
between myself, Mr. Currie,
Mr. Meetze, and Dean Terry,
all of whom were very
helpful,” Cuffe stated.

The cost of the kitchen
installation was originally’
estimated to be between $1700
and $2000 with this cost to be
split between the RHC and the
college, according to Cuffe.
College business manager
Robert Currie agreed that this
had been the original proposal,
but stated that when two
kitchens had still been
planned, the RHC had told
him that it could provide
$1000 and the SGA an
additional $500.

When the plan was altered:

to include only one kitchen,
the RHC went ahead and
financed it entirely. Currie
added that though the college
did not help finance the 4th
Belk kitchen, in all such
activities in the future, “‘our
intent is for joint financing
between the college and the
Residence Hall Council.”
‘Concerning the use of the
fourth Belk kitchen, Cuffe
saud that it was not designed
to be an alternative to the
Patterson Court eating houses
and it was hoped that as many
students as possible would use
it on a ‘“‘non-daily basis’’.
According to Belk resi-
dents, the kitchen has
changed student eating
habits. As one resident put it,
“Since we didn’t know it
would be installed over the
summer we really couldn’t
change our eating plans
accordingly. Those who were
planning to eat on the court

are doing so and those who.

planned to cook in their rooms
now have a better place to

cook.”

Another resident said that it
was used primarily for snack-
ing purposes and that the
kitchen is used by students
from all levels of Belk with a
majority from the third and
fourth floors.” She added,

The only problem with the
new facility is the fault of the
users. One fourth. Belker
complained, ‘‘Several times
I’ve gone in to use it and the
counters and sink have been
covered with dirty dishes.’

Cuffe is hopeful that
additional. kitchens will
continue to be installed on a
“fone per year‘' basis, but
added, ‘‘Any further kitchen
installation will be up to future
RHC presidents since at this
point we really don’t have the
money for them.’”’ Mr. Currie
was also hopeful that. installa-
tions would continue. He
added that the Belk kitchen
replaced a storeroom and the
proposed Little kitchen would
be put in the existing lounge
so as not to displace students.

Poll studies Carter’s stance

By KEVIN WHITE
Staff Writer

The various aspects of Dem-
ocrat Jimmy Carter’s cam-
paign were analyzed in the
second campus-wide poll of
‘‘Campaign ’76’’ conducted
the week of October 11.

The timing of this poll is
significant in that it was
conducted after the second
Ford-Carter-debate—Of those
who saw the first debate, 70
percent said they thought
Ford had won, 4 percent gave
a victory to Carter and 26
percent considered it a draw,
68 percent of those who saw
the second debate said Carter
had won, 5 percent felt Ford
had won and 27 percent con-
sidered it a draw.

Asked for whom they would
vote if the election were held
today,.55 percent supported
Ford, 42 percent named Carter

‘and 5 percent were split be-

tween Eugene McCarthy and
other candidates. These re-
sults show an increase of 2
percent for both Ford and
Carter since the last poll,
conducted before the first
debate. This indicates that the
debates are a factor in helping
undecided voters lean towards
one candidate or another. As
indicated above, they are help-

ing both Ford and Carter
equally.

Governor Carter’s potential
weak points, namely charges
of being a ‘‘flip-flop’’, of being
vague and fuzzy on the issues,
his extreme religious views,
the now famous Playboy inter-
view, and his abortion stand,
were also analyzed.

Asked if ‘‘Carter is an
excessive: flip-flop, that is, is ©
he more vague and fuzzy on
specific issues than ordin

politicians?”’, 59 percent said 4

no’’. This, in itself is insigni-

ficant. Of Ford supporters, |

however, 57 percent felt he is

excessively vague and fuzzy
and this fact is certainly
crucial in understanding
Ford’s formidable lead over
Carter at DC.

The poll indicates that the
effect of Carter’s Playboy
interview was negligible. Only
9 percent of Carter’s suppor-
ters on campus were ‘‘furned
off’’ by the interview. As
revealed in Carter’s 2-percent
jump in support, the interview
obviously did not cause any

. significant number of his sup-

porters to switch to the Ford
camp.

In other areas, 53 percent
agreed with Carter’s stand of
giving a blanket-pardon to all
Viet Nam Draft evaders. Sup-
port of this was strong among
Carter supporters (80 per
cent), and was least among
Ford supporters (30 percent).

Only 13 percent said that
Carter’s extreme religious
views made them feel unsure
about his political capabilities.
Thus religion does not appear
to be a significant factor in one
election.

The touchy abortion issue
was also analyzed with 74
percent saying that abortion,
being a moral issue, should

not be a campaign issue. 80
percent agreed with Carter’s
stand of keeping abortion legal
in all fifty states.

The final part of the poll
involved students reacting
(Favorable, Unfavorable or No
Opinion) to five Carter cam-
paign promises and programs
he has said he would initiate if
elected President. Carter re-
ceived the highest percentage
(60 percent) of ‘‘Favorable’’
votes in his plan for Tax
-Reform, specifically in giving
a tax break to lower income
families and increasing the tax
burden proportionately on up-
per income people. He received
the highest ‘‘Unfavorable”’ ra-
ting (53 percent) for his plan to
reduce the military budget by
about five billion.

In summary, the poll indi-
cates that one of Carter’s main
problems is his reputation of
being a flip-flop on the issues.
Students are also critical of
several of his campaign pro-
grams, specifically reductior.
in the military budget, Nat-
ional Health Insurance and his
liberal fiscal policies,

All these certainly contri-
bute to Carter’s minority sup-
port on the oh campus.
