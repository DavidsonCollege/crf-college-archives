Calendar Set for Next Year, Some Express Their Dissapointment

By Mandy Curtis

Instead of starting classes on
the 24th of August as was done this
year, classes for the ‘93-94 aca-
demic year will begin on August
30. This means that school will
begin an entire week later. . With
this new calendar, exams will end
the semester at noon on December
23, just two days before Christ-
mas.

The Exécutive Committee of
the Faculty, comprised of the Presi-
dent, Dean of Students, Dean of
Faculty, professors from different
departments, and an SGA repre-
sentative, meets each year in De-
cember to derive the calendars for
the next two years. In December,
the committee set a tentative cal-
endar forthe ‘94-’95 academic year
and confirmed the dates for next
year.

According to Dr. Alexander
McKelway, member of the Execu-
tive Committee of the Faculty, there
are many differentcomponents that
go into making the calendar.

There are set faculty regula-
tions for the number of classes in
each semester and for the number
of days for optional classes and
exams. Beside these policies, the
faculty requires thateach semester
begin on a Monday. —

Monday, Wednesday, and Fri-
day classes cannot meetany less or
more than Tuesday, Thursday
classes throughout the semester.
Fall break, Thanksgiving, Christ-
mas holiday, and spring break must
all be accounted for.

In the spring semester exams
must end a few days before gradu-
ation to allow for enough time for
the professors to get senior grades

in before the commencement.

Due to all of these predeter-
mined factors, the calendar falls
into place. The Executive Com-
mittee of the Faculty tries to fulfill
everyone’s expectations, includ-
ing the faculty, students, athletics,
and staff.

In regard to next year’s fall
semester, the reason that classes
will begin a week later than they
did this year has to do with when
the Monday falls in the month.
According to McKelway, “that gets
you into one week or another.”

According to McKelway, it is
a perceived desire that students
would rather lengthen their sum-
mer than start even earlier in Au-
gust. However, he said, “If you
took a vote there would be a di-
vided opinion about coming to
school a week later.”

For next year, the administra-
tion has allowed for registration
for the upperclassmen before
classes begin. As confirmed by the
Executive Committee of the Fac-
ulty, classes will begin on Mon-
day, August 30. Fall break will be
October 16-19 and Thanksgiving
will be November 24-28. Classes
will end December 10 with op-
tional class days from the 13th-
15th. Reading day will be on the
16th and exams will be from the
17th-23rd.

For the spring semester,
classes will begin January 19.
Spring break will be March 19-27.
Classes will end May 3, optional
classes will be May 4-10, reading
day on the 11th, and exams from
the 12th -18th. Commencement
will be on May 22.

A number of students have

expressed their distaste or ambiva-
lence for next year’s calendar.
“If someone lives far away-12
hours like me- it will take me a
whole day to get home. I'll get
home on Christmas Eve, We want
more time before Christmas,” said
freshman Martina Love.
Sophomore Eric McMichael
stated, “I think it’s alittle too close
to Christmas to be letting-us out.
But other than that, I don’t see a
problem with it. I like coming

back late.”

“I don’t know how many
people work over Christmas break,
butI’m awaiterand the mostmoney
comes ina week before Christmas.
Now I’ll only have one day before
Christmas. Besides, who wants to
be home until the 19th of Janu-
ary?” commented freshman Nick
Troiano.

Kappa Sig
Runs Race in
Memory of
Two Brothers

By John G. Harper

On Saturday, April 24th,
Davidson will witness yet another
fun run for charity; but this run is
different. Kappa Sigma will spon-
sor the fourth annual MADD run
in memory of two fraternity broth-
ers. In 1989, an automobile acci-
dentclaimed the lives of two Kappa
Sigma Brothers from Salisbury,
John O. Reynolds and Patrick Vir-
tue. Reynolds was a Kappa Sig
member at Davidson while Virtue

was a member of the Colorado ©

Gamma Tau chapter.

The Kappa Sigma MADD
(Mothers Against Drunk Driving)
runbegan.in.1989 as acharity relay
run to Charlotte to benefit the
Mecklenburg County MADD
chapter. In.1990, John R. Cook,
class of ‘92 from Salisbury,
changed the event to a memorial
run to Salisbury, benefiting the
Rowan County MADD Chapter.

Cook remarked, “The run in
honor of John O. and Pat was started
because of the closeness the frater-
nal bond had created among the
three of us.” Over the past three
years, the brothers of Kappa Sigma
have raised over $7,000 for
MADD. Fundraising chairs Bryan
Allison and Kevin Garbee hope to
raise $3,000 this year.

The sixty-four mile relay run
will begin this Saturday at 8 a.m.
on the Town Green in Davidson.
Each participant will run at least a
one mile section passing a football
as a baton.

The run will continue to
Salisbury, passing the Reynold’s
and Virtue’s homes, and then back
to Davidson. Scheduled to finish
at 5 p.m., the Run will conclude in
a celebration on the Town Green
for runners and supporters with
Domino’s Pizza and refreshments.
All are invited to attend.

Cook summed the run up by
stating, “It’s a fantastic project
because it’s great for the commu-
nity, great for the house, great for
MADD and great for the families
involved.”

Why Is Diamond Cut So Important?

A properly cut stone is proportioned so that
when aray of light enters it, that light will be
reflected back, through the crown or top of
the diamond with maximum prismatic “fire”.

A cut of proper portions increases the value and beauty of a
diamond, yet less than 1% of all diamonds cut are cut to ideal proportions.

Why is Carat Weight One of The
Least Important Factors ?

Improper cutting may add weight to the stone,
_ and may also reduce the stone's brilliance,

You should be aware that there is a “price break” between a 0.99ct diamond
anda 1.0ct even though there are only 2 points difference and both are ranked

as “] carat diamonds’ On top of this, the cut may make the 0.99ct appear
larger than the 1.0ct. But ore larger diamonds have si value.
