Y Initiates Program

Of Freshman Talks

The YMCA will initiate a dor-
mitory group discussion pro-
gram for freshmen that will
stimulate a more active YMCA
on campus, Neil McBryde, fresh-
man discussions chairman, an-
nounced recently.

“The object of the program,”
McBryde explained, “is  two-
"| fold.

“First, it is to provide the
‘ifreshmen with answers to the
‘| questions that quite naturally
‘larise in the first few weeks of

school. With delayed rush, they
have been cut off from frater-
nity members who previously
would have been their source of
information.

“Second, the program may
help bridge the communication
gap that has long existed be-
tween the students (especially
freshmen) and the faculty and
administration.”

Normally, members of the
faculty will lead the discussion
groups, but upperclassmen who

,| may also lead the discussions.

| “One of the chief virtues of
the plan.” according to Mc-
Bryde “is that freshmen, placed
in an academic environment. for-
eign to their high school experi-
ence, and faced with a tremen-
dous process of adjustment, now
have an outlet to voice their
own problems and frustrations.”

Under this program, the fresh-

Becomes First Class}| New Atmosphere Noted
Without Strain Of Rush

Davidson’s post office, previously second class,
became a first class office, for the time being at
least, on July 1. In addition, some changes in
policy have been made since the last academic
year.

Postmaster W. B. Mayhew explained that post
office classification is determined by revenue. col-.
lected during the calendar year. Davidson quali-
fied to become a first class office during 1964,
but this year revenue is running far behind 1964,
and it will probably revert to a second class office at
the end of the year.

“We had a good parcel post customer.” May-
hew commented. Because the post office is now
first class, however, “we can’t take his packages or
anyone else's beyond certain limitations.” Mayhew

tontinued.

As a result of the switch, money orders no
longer are sold on Saturdays.

Another change, not resulting from the switch,
concerns the dispatch of mail.from Davidson. It is
no longer picked up at 9:53 p.m. or at 3 a.m. by
the highway post office system. A letter deposited
at the post office at night does not go out until the
following morning.

Mail now leaves Davidson at 8:45 a.m., 11:30
a.m., 5:15 p.m., and arrives at 5:45 a.m., 8:45 a.m.,
1:08 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. “Mail,” emphasized Mayhew,
“should be brought over at least 30 minutes before
it is scheduled to leave.”

Finally, the post office is now locked each
night at 9 p.m. The postmaster termed this a “se-
curity measure.”

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

It was just like any other day,
not like previous first days. A
returning alumnus would prob-
ably have been. surprised. The
buildings are still the same, the
grounds, too, but something was
missing.

That something is the tense
and intense rushing that hereto-
fore dominated the lives of
freshmen and upperclassmen
alike for the first week of school.
When classes opened, no longer
were the small groups of fra-
ternity men seen going from
room to room, attempting to

, meet, get to know and impress
" the prospective freshmen rush-

ees.

_ Instead, the atmosphere has
been far more relaxed and
casual. Fraternity men still are
seen talking to freshmen, but in
a different capacity, as upper-
classmen and not as rushers.
And the strain of the nightly
rush parties on preparation for
classes has been removed.
Assistant Dean of Students

.alumni_ activities,

Tom Covington observed during
Orientation: ‘These freshmen
seem to be more sophisticated
in their questions about fraterni-
ties and rush."" Though perhaps
too technical in inquiries about
rush regulations, they seem to
be much more relaxed. Said
Covington: ‘The pressure is off.
and they can begin to settle into
college life.’

A 1965 graduate, Zach Long.
assistant to the director of
commented:
“Delaying rush has helped the
freshmen get themselves ready
for classes. It will be easier for
them to realize the importance
of college, the academics and
not the social.”

Not only will the freshmen
have a better start in their
classes, but the upperclassmen
also. They can now get back in-
to the swing, and not begin work
after rush week already three or
four days behind, as was often
the case.

“I believe that the fraternities
will be helped by deferred
rush,”’ remarked IFC Chairman

Grants Help To Improve
College Athletic Plant

Davidson's athletic and physi- of 1,000 men, a full 800 students

cal education plant will be re-
shaped and greatly enlarged
when summer improvements
and additions to playing fields
and courts are completed.

A special grant of $20,000 from
the Duke Endowment is being
used for this enhancement of
the, college's athletic facilities.

President D. Grier Martin said
that the funds, part of a $274,000
special Duke grant announced in
February would be used specifi-
cally to develop further the col-

lege’s tennis facilities and to, —

add to the intramural athletic
field area.

“These Duke funds plus a $52-
000 Richardson Foundation
grant, matched with $50,000 of
college funds for the renovation
of Richardson Field, permit us
this year to take a solid step
forward in the development of
Davidson's total athletic facili-
ties.’ Martin said.

“In the Davidson student body

are active in some facet of phy-
sical training through either the
college's physical education pro-
gram, the intramural program
or intercollegiate competition.
Davidson is making every effort
to serve these student needs
adequately as it strives primar-
ily to offer a first-quality aca-
college's physical education pro-
South"’ according to Dr. Scott.
The intramural field is to be on
the level below the present soc-
cer field.

The $20.000 Duke allocation

will give the college four new
hard-surface tennis courts and
an intramural field 200 x 400
feet in size. The tennis courts
will be adjacent to the pres-
ent tennis facilities and give the
college 16 courts in its tennis
demic program,” added Dr. Tom
Scott, athletic director.
Davidson presently has 12 var-
sity tennis courts. The present
baseball field doubles as a foot-
ball practice area and parking
Jot in fall and winter. The heavy
intramural athletic program
cannot be accommodated on

Jim Terry. ‘“‘They'll have time
to set up their rush programs
better now.” Terry also said
that he thought the, freshmen
were aware of the problem that
existed before and those which
exist now.

“If both freshmen and upper-
classmen," he continued,
“would abide by the newly set
up regulations, I think a lot of
problems can be prevented.”

The only despondent word
about the new regulations have
been heard from the freshmen,
who complain about a shortage
of transportation, both for them-
selves and their dates. They
claim that the buses which bring
the girls to the mixers leave too
early, and that they do not have
enough cars to take them back
themselves.

Terry emphasized the need for
complete cooperation f rom
everyone regarding the rush
regulations. As Terry said, “‘It
would be mighty hard to hold an
intensified rush for two months.”

men will also have a chance to
talk about the important and
controversial issues which face
not only the college community
but also the nation and the
world.

Topics to be discussed will
be determined’ from the results
of a questionnaire sent out to
both the freshmen and the .fac-
ulty.

The meetings will last about
an hour on Monday, Tuesday or
Thursday nights, starting around
10 p.m.

Discussion will consist of 10
or 12 minutes of introduction,
with the remainder of the hour
being devoted to questions and
answers.

The primary purpose is to ac-
tively engage the freshmen in
the discussion at hand and to
have them ask questions.

McBryde emphasized the im-
portance of student participa-
tion in making the program a
success.

The first meetings will be
held during the week of Sept.
27 and will be of a rather gen-
eral nature.
