A House That’s A Home

The administration has shown a
bit of hidden wisdom in its selection
this week of Marvin Sparrow as the
new director of housing.

Seniors remember the guidance
which he offered during his career
as a hall counselor; underclassmen
can look forward to a glorious begin-
ning in the Sparrow administration.

Always a man of ideas and novelty,
Sparrow has offered a marvelous idea
for the development of the college
into a communal state, in which all
students are equals.

The program will accomplish goals
many-fold. Not only will it centralize
students (something to rally behind),
but it will offer constant means of
employment of student talent (some-

thing to do).

The cost of the college will be re-
duced considerably, and the school
will be able to offer once again finan-
cial aid to meet the student need.
This will help us to get away from
the middle-class stigma.

There are so many implications of
the appointment which cannot be
measured at ‘this time. Only time will
reveal the numerous innovative ideas
which Sparrow will bring to the Da
vidson College community.

At last, someone has found the so-
lution to the age old complaint about
the. quality of the school’s student
housing.

If this is any indication of the Dec-
ade of Destiny, bring on_the rest of
the show. -

Setting Sites

We can ‘only admire the way in
which the Library Committee devel-

oped its list of priorities and follow-

deliberations.

It is extremely fortunate that the
student concerns and the plausible
plans of architects tended to coincide,
so that both interest groups could be
satisfied to the fullest.

The new library $s convenient, and
frankly, no one had expected the
school to find a site that close to all

The honors college in its initial
stages seems to be one of the most
exciting developments in the history
of the school’s curriculum.

When fully developed it could pre-

ing cards the school has to offer new
students and prospective applicants.

It is what education is really all
about.

assets? What else, except, perhaps...

In Memoriam

All of us on the staff were deeply
touched by the untimely demise of
one of our own, young Don Hoyt,
ewho recently succumbed at tHe height
of his budding literary career.

Hoyt was really at the height, and
stillon the rise. Readers of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN will probably little note
nor long remember his valiant stands
against the mawkish, the boring, the
garish, the untasteful, and stuff he
didn’t like — in the world of arts
and letters.

But one, thing that few people real-
ize about the “late, great Don Hoyt

was that art — and his work — were
his whole life. He shunned the fake,
the counterfeit, the execrable; instead
he went looking for the worthwhile
and the non-execrable, but,.couldn’t
find it’ anywhere.

Hoyt’s parting words, ‘‘Just because
it’s foreign doesn’t mean it’s good,”
should serve as an inspiration to us
ali in these trying times.

The editorial board surely speaks
for—us—alt-when, by~a vote of three
to two (with two abstentions), it ex-
pressed ‘‘a moderately deep sense of

wee at his passing. He will be miss-

— Quibbling

All. we can say is picky, picky,
picky.

If the NCAA is going to get all
upset about every little recruiting
violation they run across, the sports
world wouldn’t be a very nice place
to live, would it?

So what if Tom Stevens went a lit-
tle out of his way to make sure some
poor deserving high school swimmers
got a chance at.a college education.
For humanitarian deeds such as these

tradition. A boy has a talent and he

developes it to give himself a chance
to get ahead in the world. Does the
NCAA really want to keep these de-
serving youths in their place without
giving them a chance?

To punish Davidson College for liv-
ing up to the American dream would
seem to be uncalled for. As John
Locke would say, the government has
failed the members of the contract.
Therefore, the contract is null and
void.

It may very well be time for Da-
vidson to secede from the NCAA and
unite with sister schools under the
same yoke of unlawful government.

To the Editor:

After four years’ of find-
ing THE DAVIDSONIAN
outside my door every Fri-
day, I feel compelled to
write and say just how bad
1 think it is.

It reads like an inside joke.
I carfnever tell what is going
on.

And you guys take every-
thing too seriously. Why don't
you enjoy life? Do you have
to complain about every-
thing? The paper sounds
like a gripe sheet.

If you can’t say some-
thing good about somebody,
don't say nothing (sic) at all.
That's my standards.

THE DAVIDSONIAN | is
just not fun reading any

more. Shape up or ship out. | ,

I agree with Spiro Agnew.
You guys are out of touch
with the college, and you are
biased, aren't you?

Why, you even slant the
editorials.

While there may be some

the whole matter, I cannot
go along with the idea that
we really needa new li-
brary.

What has happened to the
good old days when students
went to football games and
basketball games and left
the library alone? Riots,
that’s what.

The only reason most of
these people want a new
library is so that they can
get more books and, you
know that if we do get more
books, well, with the morals
of our country today chances
are that over half of them
will not be about religion or
the American way+of life.

Ed, Note: The following is
an open letter to the college
community from a scholar-
ship football player who pre-
fers to remain anonymous.

Dear Dr. Spencer:

After reading your com-
passionate and moving let
ter to those of us on the
team, and after hearing, in
the eleventh hour the last
ding-dong of time as it
knelled the end of subsidiz
ed athletics, I feel that I
must respond.

I am turning myself in.

For years now J] have been
the holder of an athletic
grant-inaid. I realize that
my contractural agreement
with the college thus inter-
fers with the moral duty of
the College to grant finan-
cial ‘assistance to those in
financial need.

So I want to be the first
to try to put an end to this
moral outrage.

I am returning the un-
used portion of my grant
with the Tequest that it be
used for the betterment of -
Davidson College, the aca-
demic cammunity.

This decision has not been
an easy one. The Wildcat
Club has put me on their
list: I am no longer eligible
to receive royalties from
having my face on bubble
gum cards,

Nor will I land a summer
job counting bars af soap
at well over 3000 dollars this
summer.

But, in the spirit of the
Code of Responsibility, I felt
that I had to confess. It was
up te. me to ‘fess up." My
hand, were, so to speak,
tied. \ : :

I hopk that the combined
efforts of the Spencer Com-
mission report :and my ac-
tion will be to benefit -the
entire college community,
before it is too late.
