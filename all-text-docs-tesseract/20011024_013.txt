Gibson was optimistic about the team’s
prospects as well, noting, “We have the po-

October has been a busy month for the David-
sonmen’s golfteam. The Wildcats made an early-
month trip to UNC Wilmington for the River
Landing Intercollegiates, then spent the following
weekend in Signal Mountain, Tenn., competing in
the Chattanooga Intercollegiate Golf Classic.

On October 8-9 the Wildcats putup a fight on
the River ee Country Club’s 6,975 yard
course.

Junior Ben Friedell led the team witha final 224,
eight over par for the course. Friedell placed 18th
overall in the tournament and was accompanied
by Dan Koernke ’05, who finished with a 225 and
earned 21st place.

Other top finishers for the Wildcats were
sophomore Jon Kropski (231), freshman Joe
Zimmerman (241), and senior captain Dan
Carlson (244).

The ’Cats took 12th place overaild in the field
of 18 teams. Old Dominion captured first,

followed by host UNC Wilmington.

According to Carlson, “‘themostexciting part
of the past [two] weekends has been the play of the
freshmen.”

This “exciting” freshman play was apparent at
the Chattanoogatournament, October 15-16when
freshmen Zimmerman and Koernke led the ’Cats
to an eighth place finish against 18 teams.

Zimmerman fired a one-under 205, tying for
11" place overall. The next Wildcat on the
board, Koernke tied for 20th with a 217. Also
placing was Friedell, shooting 220 to finish 29.

Kropski and Carlson rounded out Davidson’ s'
top five. The team’s total score came to 878 on
Signal Mountain’s 6,095 yard course.

The fall season ended with the Chattanooga
tournament, but the ’Cats are eager to open their
spring season on February 18 at the Charleston
Southern Spring Kick-off Classic.

Looking ahead tothe upcoming season, Carlson
said, “We're all ready to work hard over the next
few months so we're ready to go when the season
starts again.”
