Music Review

Liz Phair scores with her new album Whip-Smart .

By Jacob Abraham

After the impressive sales and
tremendous critical acclaim that
accompanied her debut album,
Exile in Guyville, Liz. Phair has
returned with a strong sophomore
effort. Musically, Whip-Smart
serves a polished dose of guitar
pop that goes down much more
easily than her last album. Her
pointed lyrics once again attack
male-female relationships from all
sorts of different angles. This time,

however, it seems that the over-

sexed “bad girl” of Guyville is
finally interested in settling down.

The album opens with a hint
that the wild-and-fast lifestyle pro-
vides Phair with little satisfaction.
The speaker of “Chopsticks” walks
away from the one night stand,
admitting that “secretly, I’m timid.”
On the first single, “Supernova,”

Phair takes the classic pop love
song and twists it into a punk-rock
babe’s pledge of undying devo-
tion. Her praise for her lover is
brilliantly fresh and incisive:
“Your kisses are as wicked~as an
M-16... you’re everything to me.”

This description characterizes
the men in Phair’s songs: hope-
lessly hip, mysterious, and sexy in
spite of their restlessness. As she
sings on another track, “You’re an
x-ray man / You got an x-rated
mind / You’re not satisfied look-
ing at me/ You’ re always checkin’
out the girl behind.” Yet her
women refuse to take a passive
role; they aren’t afraid to tease or
manipulate, and they manage to
stay in control of their situations.
Inthe midst of emotional struggles,
they maintain an irresistibly cool
aloofness.

Several of the songs reveal a
certain softness beneath the
speaker’s tough exterior—perhaps
providing aglimpse into the woman
behind the Liz Phair image. On the

_ title track, Phair gives us her per-

spective on a mother’s hopes for
her son. Not only should he be
handsome, intelligent, and cautious
but also lively and uninhibited:
“I’m going to lock my son up ina
tower till he learns to let his hair
down far enough to climb outside.”

On “Nashville,” perhaps the
most personal song on the album,
Phair expresses her own discour-
agement with the burdens of suc-
cess. She understands that the
forces whichcurrently promote her
are likely to reject her when the
novelty of her style wears off. The
song closes with a declaration to
remain true to her music and not

buckle under the pressures of the
recording industry: “Now I don’t
crack the door too far for anyone
who’s pushing too hard on me... I
won’t decorate my love.”

This album again displays
Phair’s brilliant use of layered vo-
cals and her rough yet diverse sing-
ing range. She weaves simple har-
monies and disjointed sounds into
infectiously memorable songs,
laden with subtle hooks. Much of
Guyville’s dark edge has been re-
placed by upbeat themes and slick
production standards, but the
moods of the songs frequently vary.
“Shane,” a somber blues number,
sounds and feels like it was re-
corded in a dark garage or a smoky
bar. The stark piano and guitar
feedback on “Chopsticks” echoes
the mood of her first album, while

the country-western guitar of “May
Queen” closes the album on ahope-
ful note.

The fact that she wrote and
produced all the songs on Whip-
Smart proves Phair’s ability to
maintain control over her work
and her image; she even directed
the first video from the album her-
self. Old fans may be disappointed
that some of her snarl has been
traded for a hopeful smile, but her -
willingness to grow as a musician
saves her from the folly of repeat-
ing herself. The album’s biggest
flaw may be its lack of depth; aver-
aging at about three minutes apiece,
the songs on Whip-Smart serve
mainly as brief observations and
snippets of insight. Perhaps a good
producer could whip some more
substance out of her future efforts.

Athens band Stephanie Finger features alum,
plays music from punk to 1970s guitar rock

By Rachel Newcomb

On October 29, . former
Davidson student Peter Jackson
will be returning to Davidson with
his Athens-based band, Stephanie
Finger. The band is made up of
four members: . Sean Hogan on
bass, Steve Phillips as lead vocal-
ist, Max Howard on guitar, and
Jackson on drums. Formed in Santa
Fe, New Mexico, the band was a
trio until they moved to Athens,

Georgia and picked up Peter Jack-
son.

Their music runs the gamut of
influences from punk to 70s-based
guitar rock. “You could say we’re
somewhere in between the Sex
Pistols and the Rolling Stones,”
Jackson says.

Well-crafted melodies com-
bine with quick, brash rock and
roll to create a sound that is both
forceful and dynamic. The Athens

Flagpole calls the band “four guys
who play loud guitars that want to
hurt you.”

Stephanie Finger is an excel-
lent up-and-coming band on the
vibrant Athens music scene. Jack-
son says that they have been play-
ing in Athens a good bit, as well as
Birmingham, Alabama, and other
locations around Georgia.

You can catch their act at KA
on Saturday, October 29 at 10 p.m.

Two impressive exhibits from
Sutherland and Dasher

work deals with the fortunes and
misfortunes of relationships. The
aesthetic charm of the winding
forms both allude to both the beauty
of a dancer and the horror of a
_ Spiraling tornado.
Dan Sutherland, a painter from
San Antonio, Texas, was also
present for the walk-through. One
might be initially intrigued by the
"enormous, detailed crates which
hold Sutherland’s work. However,
according to Sutherland, this as-
pect should not be seen as primary
to his work.

“After all,” expressed
Sutherland, “the crates took me a
week to make, while the paintings
were a year in the making.” Nev-
ertheless, the casings do make an
interesting addition to the work.

Sutherland shows an incred-
ible mastery of oil paints. The
compositions are tightly polished
and, at times, intricately detailed.
His paintings often allude to other
works in the art world and even
contain references to Renaissance
painting and other traditions.

Like Dasher, Sutherland has
an incredible ability to combine
objective painting with total ab-
straction. In J Wish I Could Help
You, a magician figure with wand
and hat is surrounded by highly-
' decorated, billowing forms. Some
of the works in Sutherland’s show

contain drawings, since he sees his
paintings as a result of a long pro-
cess with many drawings. These
works are “open ended” according
to Sutherland, in comparison with
his painting.

Both of these shows are highly
impressive and the Davidson Art
Department invites students, fac-

ulty, and members of the commu-
nity to come and appreciate the
new shows. Dasher’s works are
showing in the Van Every Gallery
in the VAC until December 14,
and Sutherland’s work may be seen
in the Smith Gallery until Novem-
ber 15.
