1806 and 1936; Jefferson
And Roosevelt,

There is a tendency for historical
gullibles and hard up

delineate certain striking parallel
in the government and politics of
Jefferson's day and those of the past
four This should
somewhat unusual when we recall

the recent encomiums on Jefferson-

years, prove

jan Democracy poured on some 23
million duckbacks of the American
electorate. And it may us

to view future red-flagwaving with

cause

a bit more sanity than has been
three years characteristic.

The parallel is this: Both Jeff-
erson and Roosevelt made startling

innovations in the government;

both were objects of a malignant

hate by an uperclass; both were

called radical, liar and = anti-God,
and both were overwhelmingly
vindicated in their elections. We

may pause to note that the personal

hate of Jefferson continued
through his second administration.
From this parallel we may draw

several interesting similarities.
The Liberty League of 1804
Not the least interesting is that

noisome clique of Federalist die

hardly, equalled by modern ingen-

uity. More interesting is Hamil
ton’s proposal for the organization
of a Christian Constitutional So-

ciety to (1) support the Christian
Religion ‘and (2) The Constitution
of the Wnited States, with (a) the
use of all lawful means of promot-
ing the election of fit men and (b)
the promoting of institutions of <

charitable and. useful nature, Ham-
ilton’s that “It

useful publications” has a
ring that echoes in our mail box.
John Bayard deprecated this plan
as being unnecessarily obvious and
it was afterwards dropped, indicat-
ing that Federalistic politicians were
at least smarter in those days.
The outery against’ Jefferson, re-
markably enough, came from the

that to remove his discredit in Eu-

erson’s decision to run for re-elec-
tion. And before the election, Fed-
eralist George Troup despairingly
wrote Rufus King that very familiar
lament, “Go where you will, you
behold nothing but smiling faces
and prosperity.”

The temptation to draw a parallel
befween the Essex Junto and The
Liberty League is too great for a
credulous youth. Too tempting also
is the sight of bitter, disappointed
Fisher Ames, writing from his
farmhouse near Dedham, and Al-
fred Smith, sulking in the empty
floors of the Empire State: sym-
bols of the eras. But there is 8er-

ire notably Bobby Peters, Buddy
Branton, Chubby King, Pete Me-

Knight, Dick Vewles and Pinkey
Stowe, are talking up Goodman's
smooth swing and Helen Ward,

Benny's vivacious (yes suh!!) torch

singer.

Then on the other end of the line

there are those lovers of the rather
quiet, soothingly sleepy music of
Wayne King, Eddie——Duehin, or

Richard Himber, or perhaps Jack

Denny. Among the supporters of

Going back to the “swing music”
which seems to be THES fad at the

present time, other artists in_ this
line which have been the topic for
more than one bull session are:

Tommy Dorsey, Fletcher Hender
