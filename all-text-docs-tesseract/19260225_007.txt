several minutes before Newcomb, Tar Heel
center, caged the ball on a pot shot to start
the scoring. After that it was just a ques-
tion of how many points the Southern cham-
pions could count in the time allotted them.
Newcomb, Hackney, Cobb and Dodderer all
contributed their share of the fireworks in
that first half that ended with the Carolina
five leading 20 to 5.

The last half started off tamely like the
first, but big Artie Newcomb began cutting
loose shots from all angles and caging the
biggest majority of them.

defeated Davidson, 35 to 19, here Saturday

inight in the last home game of the season

for the Red Terrors.

After the first few minutes of play, when
the Wildcats took the lead by a count of ‘five
to two, the Terrors began to terrify, the out-
come was never in doubt, and Tebell’s smooth
working quint gradually piled up a sufficient
lead to enable the Tech mentor to replace his
regulars with substitutes.

Captain Fletcher Dickins, State’s brilliant
forward and the only’ senior on the squad,
played his last game before the home folks,
ran wild against the Presbyterians. He

McDowall, in addition to playing a great
defensive game, checked in nine points for

Duke University celebrated the Cherry
Tree Lad’s birthday here Monday night by
defeating Davidson College in a hotly con-
tested basketball game, an extra five minutes
of play being required to decide the winner.

The final score stood 32 to 30 after one of
the most evenly matched contests here. While
not a great game, it was certainly a spec-
tacular one, and was highly satisfactory to
Duke.

Ed Bullock was Duke's shining light, gar-

times by Bennett and Kelly. Simpson and
Anderson led the Wildcat attack, garnering
eight and seven points respectively.

spinning. The popularity of this light
form of recreation might be traced back
to the field of experimental psychology
in connection with the study of the spec-

quite a different matter. All that are in-
