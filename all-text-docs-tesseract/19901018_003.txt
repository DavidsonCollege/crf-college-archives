dividual basis. When a faculty
member retires, our first inclina-

tion is to go back and hire a young
person because of new blood,” said
Dr. Williams. “We look at all the
major graduate schools, but we’re
looking for a particular commit-
mentto teaching atthe undergradu-
ate level.”

In many ways Davidson is ina
different position from other insti-
tutions. It has had a long and con-
tinuing liberal arts tradition which
makes finding and hiring top pro-
fessors more feasible.

“One of the nice things about

Davidson,” said Dr. Williams, “is _
that it has really held fast to a core.

liberal arts curriculum....It tums out
that because those are still solid
areas all through the university
system, you can continuously get
good people and have a very good
applicant pool.”
According to Dr. Williams, it
is possible that in the future
Davidson will be faced with tougher
competition from larger schools for

faculty positions, Many of

Davidson’s faculty members who
were hired-in the 1970s and early

80s are at the prime of their ca-
reers, and as major universities
begin torediscover the importance
of teaching, there will be greater
competition in the market and a

» greater chance that our departments

will be raided.

“From. my perspective, the
major problem is that other institu-
tions are going to do this to
Davidson, not that Davidson is
going to do it to them. Even if we
wanted to, we don’t have the re-
sources to buy a French depart-
ment or.a chemistry department,”
said Dr. Williams.

In past years, Davidson has
not had problems attracting fac-
ulty. According to Dr. Williams,

eight offers were made last year,

and all of them were accepted.
Davidson’s somewhat rural loca-
tion is notattractive to some, espe-

_Cially single professors, but those’

who want to teach at a large uni-
versity. in a big city would not
apply to Davidson in the first place.

“The bottom line,” said Dr.
Williams, “is that we have not
experienced any problems in fac-
ulty recruiting; certainly our sala-
Ties are competitive at the entry
level. We will, I believe, continue
to experience problems with reten-

Louna. “It has an excellent reputa-
tion in the South. It was a matter of

time before we were in the top ten.

We will definitely go up.”
Both students and faculty hope
: the ranking will translate into in-
creased recognition for Davidson.
“Name recognition is invaluable

if we have a college fair in Los

tion of the best faculty.”

This problem with retention,
Dr. Williams thinks, isnot so much
an issue of salary but of career
choice. Some will go to large insti-
tutions to make more, teach fewer
classes, and as a result, publish
much more frequently.

“Some who have been at.
Davidson for maybe ten years may -

be getting itchy. They want toknow
what the rest of the world is like,”
said Dr. Williams.

There are plans to help keep
Davidson from being affected by
the increasing trend of faculty raids.

According to Dr. Williams, entry-

level salaries have had to be
“moved along,” and a committee
is working to increase faculty
compensation on the basis of merit.

“We have not really had any
faculty leave Davidson,” said Dr.
Williams, “since John Kuykendall
came, if we didn’t want them to,
and that’s remarkable. The fact is
people like this place. The stu-
dents are really our best advertise-
ment. One of the reasons faculty
like teaching, and one of the things
that’s going to keep them inter-
ested, is the quality of the students.
As long as we have good students,
they'll stick with us.”

“Tt was a trying, different and
difficult experience as a student,
but I’m a better person now,” he
continued. “Davidson gave me
skills in basic understanding and
communication J don’t think I
would have gottcn anywhere else
in the country.”

He said that he wants to see
more blacks at Davidson, but he is
satisfied with the college’s attempts
toward integration, given the

_ numberof black students qualified

and willing to attend. He acknowl-
edges there is more that Davidson
can do to make itself attractive to

‘black studentsand employees, and

believes that his election is one
such positive move.

her first trip overseas. _

“I’m really excited, butkind of

_apprehensive,” she said. “In a way

I’m glad I haven’t been to western
Europe before because I won’t
really have anything to compare
central Europe to.”

Though she isnew tothe world
of international conferences, Wil-
liamson._does have a background
in agriculture, growing up on a
farm in Crewe, Virginia, 60 miles
southwest of Richmond.

Williamson said that her in-
ternship with the International

Policy Council awakened new

interests in her future career, and
reaffirmed her goal to work in in-
ternational trade and relations.
“Agriculture has always been a
large part of my life, but I had
never really thought about it in the
international diplomatic sense that

Caroline Williamson
I thought about it this summer,”
she said.

Williamson,a political science
major, said she would like to inde-
pendently study Sovietagricultural
policy more in depth at Davidson.
“I became interested in the fact
that agricultural policy is a func-
tion of the leaders of the time,” she
said,

When Williamson returns
from her trip, she will be speaking
toseveral groups on campusabout
her experiences.
