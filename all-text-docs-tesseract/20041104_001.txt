Alumni
Relations: a
srowing job

By Kate GILLESPIE
Senior Staff Writer

In 1900, the average American
lived to be 45 years old. Today life
expectancy has soared to 85 years,
producing an unexpected result for
the Davidson College administra-
tion: more work for the Office of
Alumni Relations.

Director of Alumni Relations Matt
Merrell describes the office as “a
student of the study of demograph-
ics.”

“Unlike any time in the history of
man, you now have multiple genera-
tions that make up America,” Merrell
said. “The Alumni Office reflects
that. We’ve taken an approach of
studying demographics to determine
who our alumni are.”

Davidson currently has just under
19,500 alumni, 60 percent of whom
have graduated since 1980. The
Alumni Office considers the differ-
ing needs and demands of each gen-
eration when sending out communi-
cations and planning reunion events.

“We know that our youngest
alumni are an age group for whom
technology is important,” Merrell
said.

“Increasingly the Alumni Office is
reaching out to them through a web
presence and electronic invitations.
They are more responsive to those
than by mail.”

Statistics about alumni are gath-
ered through surveys that the Alumni
Office sends to the classes every five
years when they hold their reunions.

Students crowd Union
to watch election

By Davin Crow
Editor-in-Chief

Tuesday night, Democrats and
Republicans alike crowded into the
C. Shaw Smith 900 Room to watch
the results of the 2004 election.

By the time the room closed down
at 1 a.m. the nation was still without
a definite winner as the Kerry Cam-
paign, down significantly in Elec-
toral College votes, refused to con-
cede the election until every vote had
been counted in the key swing state
of Ohio.

It was not until late Wednesday
morning that Senator Kerry called
President Bush to formally concede
the election after the Kerry Campaign
concluded that there was no math-
ematical way that they could win
Ohio.

For many of the Davidson students
who were watching Tuesday night,

the final outcome was somewhat of
a shock.

Taylor Ansley ’07, Co-President of
the Young Democrats, said after the
election, “I was surprised. I honestly
believed Kerry would win.”

However, for other students the
results were just as they expected.

Jack Hubbard ’06, Vice President
of the College Republicans, said he
was not surprised how the results
unfolded.

“While the results may have been
slow, we had a winner within 24
hours of the last polls closing. This
was a Clear and decisive win for the
President and conservatives in this
country,” said Hubbard.

Professor of Political Science Dr.
Pat Sellers, who organized the event
in the 900 Room, was also not en-
tirely surprised by the final outcome.

“In the short term I was surprised

Ada Jenkins Center lets students share talents

By JackiE McKEon
Senior Staff Writer

The Ada Jenkins Center of
Davidson functions as a nonprofit
organization that provides health,
education, and other necessary ser-
vices to members of the community.

The Ada Jenkins Center provides
Davidson students with numerous
outlets to serve the local community
and to share their talents. Students
volunteer in various capacities, such
as tutoring for the After School Pro-
gram, providing translation services
for the Free Clinic of Our Towns, and

performing light office duties.

“The students are represented
throughout all of our programming
and, in some cases, are key leaders
in programs suchas the After School
Program and the Free Medical
Clinic,” said Ada Jenkins executive
director Bill Johnson.

The After School Program is in
session Monday through Friday and
places student volunteers with el-
ementary school students from low-
income families. Volunteers act as
mentors and tutors for the youths by
assisting them with their homework
and providing them with an overall

positive example.

“The student volunteers have a
tremendous impact on the children
and, in turn, the program. Because
the children admire the volunteers so
much the children wantto get to know
them, to develop relationships with
the volunteers, and to be like the
volunteers,” said After School Pro-
gram director Diane Means.

Bonner Scholars are large con-
tributors to the After School Program.

“The Bonner Scholarship was
founded with the intention that all
Bonners would work with children.

Survey shows students
leaned toward Kerry

By Liz Barry
Senior Staff Writer

Despite Davidson’s conservative
reputation, student voters leaned to-
ward Senator John Kerry by 23 per-
centage points in Tuesday’s presiden-
tial election, according to a recent
student survey.

Survey results indicated that 58
percent of students intended to vote
for Kerry, 35 percent for President
George W. Bush and seven percent
were still undecided.

Party registration revealed a
smaller disparity, with 54 percent
registered as Democrat, 41 percent
Republican and 5 percent Indepen-
dent.

Over the past four years, survey
results indicate a small but consis-
tent Democratic lean on campus,
with students supporting the Demo-
cratic Party by just over ten percent-
age points each year.

Davidson’s high level of political
diversity does not surprise many
members of the Davidson commu-
nity.

Trey Skinner ’07; secretary of
College Republicans, said it is natu-
ral for college students to be gener-
ally more liberal than other age
groups, and is therefore not surprised
by the survey results.

“Young people are usually more
liberal,” he said. “They need to live
in the world a little while until some
of them can sober up. Of course, I’m
being facetious, but that does seem
to’ be the trend.”

~ How Davidson students vote —

Chris Burks ’07, co-president of
Young Democrats, said he attributes
high levels of Democratic support
among college students to negative
perceptions toward the Republican
Party.

“In college, students generally are
able to begin to form political opin-
ions separate from their parents,” he
said. “College students are realizing
that John Kerry and the Democratic
Party have a positive plan for the
future of our country while many
Republicans are still stuck in the di-
visive politics of the past.” |

When considering social issues,
young people tend to support liberal
policies that minimize the role of
rules and regulations, said Mary
Thornberry, department chair and
professor.of Political Science.

At Davidson, students’ active in-
volvement in community service
may have contributed to their in-
creased support for certain liberal
ideals.

“Through social service work, like
tutoring at Ada Jenkins, many stu-
dents see the genuine disadvantage
that some people run into across the
country and that may open students
to a certain kind of liberalism,”
Thornberry said. ““They may see the
role of someone’s duty, which may
or may not be the government’s, to
care for the poor.”

However, it is difficult to predict
whether today’s young people will
continue their liberal tendencies in
future decades.
