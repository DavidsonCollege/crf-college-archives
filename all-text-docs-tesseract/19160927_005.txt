A LANDMARK REACHED

The old ship of college life, minus
her last vestige of the hazing spirit, has
steered strait thus far thru the collegi-
ate year—and with the general atmos-
phere so changed that it is noticeable
even to the least casual observer. At
the time the regime under which we are
now living was voted on favorably, some
said let us beware of the kindergarten,
others suggested that a matron be em-
ployed; but I can see in the action that
was taken just the change from prep.
schoolism to real college life. In after
years we will not hear the members of
the class of 1920 tell of the hazing to
which they fell a prey, the subsequent
bad beginning in their work, ending
finally in their leaving college; but of
the hearty welcome which they reccived
from upper-classmen, the splendid be-

was once a student, organize a large

Such clubs have been organized, or soon
will be, at all of the larger colleges and
universities of the nation. And_ shall
Davidson, the President's once alma
mater, fail to show him that we ap-
prove of his policies and would like to
see them in vogue for another four
years? I would like to suggest that a
