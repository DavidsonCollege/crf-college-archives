here during the past two years,
and are sorry to be going.” he

just begun.”

Melton

By BRUCE CORSER
Asst. Managing Editor

Julius Melton, director of
deferred giving and associate
professor of religion at South-
western at Memphis (Tenn.),
will assume the duties of direc-
tor of deferred giving at David-
son, effective March 1.

‘‘Davidson's deferred gift
program means any gift
coming to the college at a later
date through wills. bequests.
and charitable remainder
trusts. or through Davidson's
pooled income fund.”’ according
to Donald L. Winston, David-
son's director of development

“Under Davidson's trust fun-
ds and pooled income tund. a
donor can retain income from a
giutt. for lite. and still have a por-
tion of that gitt be deductible.”
he continued

“Since it began two vears
ago. our deferred giving
program has grown steadily.”

said C. David Cornell. vice
president for timanee and
development. “‘Under Dr

Melton's direction we are con-
fident it will become one of the
most successful programs of its
kind in the country.”

The trustees met with college officials last 5
to decide on 1973-74 college budget.

To Direct Deferred Gifts

As head of the relatively new
deferred gift program, Melton
will endeavor to make the alum-
ni and friends of Davidson
aware of the opportunities
available through this type of
program. Winston said that
within the last 18 months ‘‘in ex-
cess of $300,000 has been ob-
tained through these various
trusts.

“What we do today in our
deffered giving program will
build a strong foundation for
Davidson's future.’ he em-
phasized. Winston estimated
that approximately 20 percent
of the total amount raised by
the college would be derived
from the deferred giving
program within the next three
or four vears

Although the concept is not
new. the tan law of 1969 has en-
couraged this type of philan-
thropic donation. Winston
reported that most respected
colleges. especially the New
England schools. were tar
ahead of Davidson in this type
of program. “If Davidson had a
deterred gift program 15 vears
ago. we would be benefiting
from that income today.” he
stated

College Exchange Draws Nine,
Others Apply To JY A Program

By HUGH MOORE
Contributing Editor

Off-campus study for next
year is drawing about the same
number of students as it has in
the past.

The Eight-College Student
Exchange Program, whose ap-
plication deadline was Monday.
has attracted nine applicants.
eight rising juniors and one
rising sophomore. Accepted ap-
plicants are to be notified about
March 1.

**Most of these are accepted,”
Exchange Program Officer Jay
H. Ostwalt said. “We don't ex-
pect any problems.”

A Davidson student in the
program studies for a year in
one of seven liberal arts
colleges in Virginia. Of the nine
who have applied. eight have
opted for Hollins College. one
for Randolph-Macon Women’s
College

There has been some question

about the future of the program.
On this point Ostwalt com-
mented: “The men_ students
must participate in greater
numbers than in the past if the
program is to survive. Sub-
stantial numbers must also at-
tend each of the participating
women’s colleges.”

Most of the students an
ticipating study off-campus
next vear, though, are con-
sidering going further than the
next state. At present 18 stu-
dents have applied tor Junior
Year Abroad (JYA) in France
at the University of Montpellier
and 13 for JYA in Germany at
Marburg University. Both of
these programs are sponsored
by Davidson.

There are 12 other students

who wish to study elsewhere
abroad, namely in Africa,
Britain) and Spain. Since
Davidson does not have vear-
long programs in these coun-

tries. interested students must
apply both to the Foreign Study
Committee and to the host
college.

For those students who are
considering spending a year in
Atrica, the American Study In
Africa Program is helping with
placement.

The application deadline for
study abroad is March 14.
Director of Overseas Studies
Paul C. Fisher was not sure how
many more applications would
come in before that time.
“There seems almost a lack of
adventurous spirit,” he said.

For JYA in Germany the
number of applications is
slightly below the norm. Fisher
attributes this in part to wary
premedical majors who are
afraid a year of pass-fail
grading in Germany will hurt
their grade point averages.

“LT don't think it really hurts.”
Fisher said. “but students have
to be cautious.”

DELIBERATING ON OUR FUTURE

pring to approve a budget. They will meet again today

Describing deferred giving as
a ‘fine program for men con-
cerned with taking care of their
wives after they're gone,"’ Win-
ston said that the success of the
program will depend to a large
degree on ‘‘educating our alum-
ni and making them aware of
what we have to.offer.”’

Although the college offers a
variety of annuity and life in-
come plans, all include
basically the same concept: a
gift is given irrevocably to
Davidson and by legal contract
the College agrees to pay in-
come for life to named
beneficiaries.

Advantages offered by
various programs
numerous. In all plans, the
donor is entitled to an im-
mediate charitable deduction
for income tax purposes. The
exact amount of the deduction
depends upon the size of the
gill, ages of the beneficiaries.
and the income rates.

Besides this. a

ferred to Davidson jis excluded
from the donor's taxable estate.

Three major types. of
programs embraced within the
sphere of the college are an-
nuity agreements, unitrusts,
and pool funds.

Annuity settlements specify
that a fixed percentage of the
total capital turned over the the
college will be returned to the
donor each year for life.

Unitrusts differ in that, under
their terms, annual payments
will be made for the donor's
lifetime based on a fixed per-
centage of the trust’s assets.

A pool fund, as its name im-
ples, is set up on a group basis.
Participants donate money to a
central pool and are given
credit tor a corresponding num-
ber of units of the tund. The
college invests the fund and
returns to its contributors an-
nual payments based on the
current value of the investment.

Many others take it elsewhere for fear of doing poorly here. Col-

take physics at other colleges.
