Microscope Use St

By. DAVID VAN PELT

The Biology Department has
suspended the use of its ISI-40
Scanning Electron Microscope
(SEM) indefinitely because a ser-
vice contract for the machine
which expired in February has not
been renewed, according to Biol-
ogy Department Chairman John
Williamson.

Williamson said faculty re-
search and several student pro-
jects have been affected by the
suspended use of the SEM, which
is used by the Biology and Physics
departments.

According to Williamson, the
SEM, “a fairly sophisticated
machine,” is too delicate to be op-
erated without a service contract,
which provides for unlimited re-
pairs of the machine for the price
of the contract. A contract would
cost approximately $4,500 per
year, he said, which the Biology
department cannot afford.

Senior William Crone is using

dent study project in anatomy, this
term, after training all last term to
be able to use the SEM. He said
his research will be affected by the
inferiority of the light microscope
compared to the SEM. “I’m doing
the next best thing to the one I re-
ally wanted to do,” he said. “What
I find hard to believe is that the
College can find no money any-
where for the SEM contract.”

The Biology Department pur-
chased the SEM in the fall of 1982
with $60,000 donated anonym-
ously for the purchase of an elec-
tron microscope, Williamson
said. Williamson said the Biology
Department bought a $72,000
microscope for $60,000 and re-
ceived a two-year service contract
on the new machine.

Williamson said that to afford
a service contract for the SEM, the
Biology Department would have
to appropriate money from other
areas, such as laboratory funds for

For the first time in Davidson
College history, the student body
this week elected a woman as Stu-
dent Government Association
president. Junidr Beadsie Woo
won a run-off election against
junior Edward Hay, and sopho-

more Christie Johnson was
elected vice president.
Although she is the first

woman to hold the top position in
the SGA, Woo said her election
“is nothing outside of the trend,”
as women lead the Y-Student Ser-
vice Corps, Quips and Cranks,
the Honor Council, and hold other
top posts in organizations such as
the Union Board.

She said the SGA plans to re-
install the SGA Charter and
Bylaws Committee to make the
bylaws “a tighter document.” The
SGA will also conduct a “self-
study, to look at the bylaws and
the internal structure” of the or-
ganization. She hopes the SGA

can determine “why we're break-
ing down” in certain areas and
why the SGA is perceived as
“being an ineffectual lobbying
force.”

“The SGA has an image prob-
lem,” she said. “I don’t know
where it originates,” but the self-
study may reveal ‘what we are
doing and not doing so we can get
to the root of the problem.” She
said she can’t predict specific re-
visions but there may be “struc-
tural or attitude changes” as a re-
sult of the study.

Woo said the SGA will con-
tinue to do “the same types of
things, but the perspective will be
different” as the organization
“will no longer be dominated by
men.”

Johnson sees a “more positive
attitude towards women” though
there is still “some animosity to-
wards women.” She said she
heard some students express the
opinion that they don’t want a

woman in both SGA positions.

She said the election “shows a
positive direction” for women but
emphasized that she and Woo
were elected not because they
were women, but “because we are
qualified.”

In addition to conducting the
self-study, and trying to improve
its image, the SGA may address
Davidson’s athletics and the pos-
sibility of having the football and
basketball teams in different con-
ferences, according to Johnson.
She said they may also recom-
mend more security systems be
implemented.

Finally, she said “the
Women’s Impact Study Commit-
tee, an ad hoc group of the SGA,
will report on the survey” they are
currently administering. “It’s up
to the SGA [to act] depending on
what the survey results show.” In
general, Johnson said, “the at-
titudes toward women on campus
are not bad.”

“introductory courses. He said the
limited number of students able to
use the SEM does not justify such
a move.

Williamson said he did not
know the Biology Department
operating budget would be re-
sponsible for maintaining the
SEM. He said he thought outside
funds would be available for the
service contract, specifically from
a fund designed by the Depart-
ment Office in 1983 for the
maintenance of scientific instru-
ments.

Vice President of Develop-
ment Jack Powers said that this
fund does exist but only has sev-
eral thousand dollars at present.
He said the Department office is
looking for endowments to main-
tain the SEM and other technolog-
ical equipment, but that it receives

o “higher priority” than other

College programs.

SCC To Approve Honor Council Changes In Procedure

By DAVID VAN PELT

The Student Conduct Council
is expected to approve changes in
Honor Council proceedings at a
meeting next Tuesday, as well as
discuss other possible modifica-
tions of the current system, ac-
cording to Dean of Students and
Chairman of the Student Conduct
Council Will Terry.

The anticipated changes in-
clude rescheduling elections for
student solicitors and defense ad-
visors from spring to winter term,
though they will continue to take
office in the spring. Terry said this
change will give solicitors and de-

fense advisors a training period of
several months under the gui-
dance of the outgoing officers.
Elections for other Honor Council
members will still be held in the
spring.

The SCC will also approve a
restriction requiring Honor Coun-
cil cases occurring at the end of
the school year to be completed
during the summer, instead of re-
suming the following school year
as current Council regulations
permit. Honor Council Chairper-
son Nancy Rosselot said this regu-
lation will insure accurate tes-
timony and prevent the loss of po-

tential witnesses through gradua-
tion and study-abroad programs.

Both measures were approved
unanimously at the Student Con-
duct Council’s March 19th meet-
ing, but all changes in the Honor
Council Code require two votes
by the Student Conduct Council at
least two weeks apart. Terry said
he expects a similar Committee
response toward the proposals on
Tuesday. The measures will the
be sent to President Kuykendall
for a final approval.

Though Honor Council mem-
bers do not vote on the Student
Conduct Council proposals, Terry

said Honor Council members
have participated in SCC meet-
ings to evaluate its proposals and
make suggestions.

Rosselot said the winter elec-
tion schedule will allow an impor-
tant training period for new de-
fense advisors and_ solicitors.
Though most defense advisors
and solicitors have previously
held Honor Council positions,
Rosselot thinks the new arrange-
ment will be useful. “Inexperi-
ence has never been a big problem
(in defense advisors and sol-
icitors). At the same time, this in-
sures it will be even better.” she

said. Under the new arrangement.
defense advisors and solicitors
will prepare a manual for their
successors explaining Honor
Council procedure. Rosselot said
this process is done now on a more
informal basis.

The new time restriction for
Honor Council cases occurring at
the end of the school year will
allow a maximum of 25 days
beyond the normal 20-day restnc-
tion in effect during the school
year, Rosselot said.

According to Rosselot, during
the school year the Dean's office
