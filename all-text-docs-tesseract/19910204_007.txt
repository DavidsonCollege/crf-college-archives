Rude Notes and Random Scribblings .
On The Decay Of School Spirit & The Necessity Of A Good, Stiff Drink

Sometimes I wonder. I won-
der about the little things like why
no one’s taken a shot at Quayle, or
why Jerry Lewis hasn’t been
banned from society, or why the
hell “Pete” (you know, from Neu-
tron Ind.) wants the male members
of the Davidson community to call
him collect. (The weekly backlash
from the bourbon swilling Repub-
lican hordes is obviously begin-
ning to take its toll.) Recently,
however, I have been intrigued by
yet another strange but true hap-
pening: people are actually bitch-
ing about the lack of school spirit
here at Davidson.

“I was embarrassed,” said a
sophomore.

“T couldn’t believe it,” quoth a

junior.

“It’s just a disgrace,” echoed
the senior.

“What we need is a really swell
| pep rally,” erupted some dork.
These are just a few of the state-

ments wafting around campus
regarding, specifically, the poor
showing of Davidson students at
last week’s basketball game against
the UNCC 49ers at the Charlotte
| Coliseum, Can you believe it?
These idiots don’t understand why
Davidson students refuse to ex-
press any institutional animation.

You have to be kidding me.

Before I begin, let me tell you
that I have no idea where this let-
ter/article will end up for I have-
n’t bothered to pick up my
thoughts where I left off -- wait-
ing in line at the ultra-prestig-
ious-invite-only-black-tie-op-
tional-gala-affair NFL Properties
Silver Celebration at the Dolphin
Hotel in Orlando, FL the night
before the Super Bowl. Yes, I did
land tickets and really enjoyed
the game. I am glad I went. Why
I was able to go, and who I saw
(and didn’t see) is the reason Iam
writing, however.

I was invited to the “‘gala af-
fair” becfause my father is a sen-
ior executive with a major corpo-
ration. That “major corporation”
does millions of dollars of busi-
ness with the NFL -- all one thou-
sand or so other guests repre-
sented substantial business inter-
ests as well. Hard as it may be to
swallow, we weren’t invited
because NFL Properties likes us
personally,

Well, as they say, “family is
family, but business is business.”
Anyway, what struck me is some-
thing my father said while in line
amidst all the security. He noted
that there was not a-black person
in sight -- or any other minority
for that matter. The reason was
lear: there simply weren’t many
minority senior executives with
major corporations to invite. I
guess I would like to say that I felt

the revelation somehow ruined
my night, Well, it didn’t. (Thus, I
hope not to cut myself too badly
when throwing these stones from
my glass house!)

One might ask how this re-
lates to our beloved Davidson.
The answer is two-fold: First,
Davidson has and will produce
many leaders incorporate Amer-
ica. Second, Davidson prides it-
selfon community awarenessand
social action,etc.

I, like, many other Davidson
students, have been involved at
one time or another in acommu-
nity service project. I spent a few
months last year working at a
soup kitchen in Atlanta -- an ex-
perience that most all my friends
at Davidson were very impressed
with,

I felt then (and still do now)
that human problems were much
more important than whether of
not McDonald’s uses styrofoam
or the abuses of the fur trade.

escapes me. Sorry, I don’t pre-
tend that I am more noble or that
the people who wish to clean up
the environment don’t do good
work; I justhave a different set of
priorities - for right or wrong.

smart ass columnist” wins the In-
troduction to Wit Award, so con-
gratulate yourself.)

Davidson students, thank God,
tend to refrain from such embar-
rassing activity. But even if they
did have itin their
natures toactlike

are nothing less than training camps
for the overpaid, hypersexed,
poorly read role models of tom-
morrow’s NBA. We just seem to

we were playing teams against

worry about getting a seat in ad-
vance. What happened? Are you
people getting less fiber these days,
or do you just find a cheap thrill in
making that 17 million dollar atroc-
ity even less accessible to the aver-
age Davidson student?

that it’s pretty
much the only
place on cam-
pus where you
can’t get a

teams? I think
not. Color me
pessimist, but I have a wee tiny bit
of trouble enthusing myself (no,
not that way, you perverts) when
we’re playing against the basket-
ball toting behemoths of UNCC,
Virginia, or Duke. Words like “no
chance” and “why bother?” spring
to mind when I hear about such
contests. Hell, the only reason
most people went to the game
against USC was to see a few slam
dunks,

I want to make it absolutely
clear that I don’tblame the players,
and I’m not just saying that be-
cause I’m skinny and weak. But
Davidson is supposed to be a pri-
mariy academic institution, unlike
some of our Division I rivals which

whom we had more of a chance.
(If you question this assessment,
just look back to the excitement
surrounding the football team last
fall as compared to a few years
ago.) .

' More importantly, how can we
be spirited when it takes less effort
to evade airport security and most
customs officials than to getaticket
to a Davidson game? One can
more easily get a beer at Kappa Sig
than a decent seat. The secret
police at the Baker Sports Indul-
gence should seriously lighten up
about the ticket policy. Remember
the good old days in JohnstonGym?
Students could wander in at their
leisure, without ever having to

beer. It’s not
as if every-
body wants to get loaded, but in
this alcohol soaked environment,
people just feel out of place in a
room fullofsober people whodon’t
smell like Busch. You can’t even
bring your own intoxicants with-
out some well armed meter maid
or upstanding young pain in the ass
hassling your potential buzz.

My advice: screw the NCAA
regulations. If other schools give
away money and cars in order to
beef up their athletic programs,
why don’t we follow suit and start
schlepping out a few drinks? If
you want truly happy fans, don’t
worry too much about winning.
They'll get over the losses - if
they’re good ‘n’ drunk.

Why Can't We Deal With Gays?

Wait a minute! Did I see the
word “homosexual” in print at
Davidson? Tides must be turning.
It was only last year I overheard,
“There is one thing I can be really
proud of about Davidson. We have
no gay or lesbian organizations.” I

can only believe the speaker was
serious.. He looked. like Joe
Davidson: Duckheads, Bucks, a
Hard RockCafe shirt. And, unfor-
tunately, he sounded like Joe (or
Jane) Davidson.

For a group of socially con-
scious people (think of all the stu-
dents active in Amnesty Interna-
tional, the service committees,

* Habitat for Humanity, the North

Carolina Student Legislature,
Davidson Environmental Action,
and all the others who do so much
good for so many people), as a.
community we have a blind spot.

I find the: lack ofan open gay
and lesbian association on campus
a serious drawback in our social
education. Believe it or not, there
are gays here. They are minority
students. Unlike color and gender,
however, sexual orientaion cannot
be judged just by looking at a per-
son. Forthis reason, most students
conveniently forget that there is a
minority group here the concerns
of which are never addressed at a
forum or. committee meeting.

Occasionally the issue will be .

raised, either publicly or in con-
versation (like Mr. Hornsby’s Vail
Commons Dinner Conversation).
For those folks who remember
Lucia Kendall’s opinion piece last
spring on the hypothetical coming
out of a hypothetical lesbian on
campus, you will probably also
remember the discussions that fol-
lowed the publication of that ar-
ticle. I distinctly recall some men
in one of my classes who deter-
mined that the only reason Ms.
Kendall was able to write the ar-
ticle was because she herself was a
lesbian.

That attitude forces an emo-

tional stumbling block on campus”

every day. People do not assume
that in order to support desegrega-
tion a person must be black, or that
in order to support the role of
women in the workplace a person
must be female. Yet the opinion is
offered up again and again that in
order to support gay rights a per-
son must be gay. That just is not
80.0

After attending San Fran-
cisco’s Gay and Lesbian Pride
parade last summer, I can vouch

that'there were a large number of
us “heteros”’ out in force to show
our support for the quiet minority.
In Charlotte, there is an active
chapter of Parents and Friends of
Lesbians and Gays. No such back-
ing exists here, though.

I-believe the reason’ no ‘suc-
cessful gay and lesbian ‘associa-
tions endure for long periods here
is because it is dangerous, emo-
tionally and physically, to come
out on this campus. Our school is
small, and relatively homogene-
ous. ;

Itis not that everyone is intol-
erant, merely that most have simi-
Jar cultural and moral backgrounds.
The pervading viewpoint in Amer-
ica is homophobic, except in iso-
lated communities (like universi-
ties), and many Davidson students
have absorbed that homophobia.
As students working for intellec-
tual independence and improve-
ment, though, we should contem-
plate questioning. our value sys-
tem. Not to say itisall garbage, but
it might not all be terrific either.

If we talk and consider the
unconscious oppression existing
here, maybe it will dissipate.
Maybe in five years the cover story
on the Davidson Journal will be
“The Gay Experience at
Davidson.” Maybe Davidson will
join the majority of campuses
across the nation which foster, not
just tolerate, all types of diversity.
