March Madness,
according to the DSS

Is college basketball as we know it
dying right before our eyes?

That is a question being discussed
more and more every successive sea-
son, it seems.

Over-anxious and often overcon-
fident underclassmen bolt forthe NBA’s
riches as if the collegiate ranks repre-
sent nothing more than a pitstop on the
way to stardom.

But this year’s NCAA tournament
could force some future standout
hoopsters to reconsider.

A reassuring trend is developing
inthis year’s Dance. Teams built around
senior leadership are advancing; inex-
perienced cohorts of raw talent, on the
other hand, are not. : ;

Carolina, Kansas, Providence,
Stanford, Utah, UCLA, and Minnesota
all have senior shoulders on which to

jump come crunch time.

Swimmers finish title season

ECACs expose top Wildcat swimmers to faster competition

By WILL BRADSHAW
Sports Editor

While many students were sun-
ning themselves in Florida and the
Caribbean, ten men and ten women
from the Southern States Cham-
pion swim teams traveled to Sewell,
N.J., for the East Coast Athletic
Conference (ECAC) championship
meet Feb.:27-Mar. 1.

The women finished 11th out
of 40 teams (136 points), and the
men grabbed ninth (156).

“Tt was areally fun meet,” Keith
Nelson said. “Swimming against

.all these teams that are a lot better

than what we’ve seen all year was
fun. It was faster than Southerns,
and it’s always exciting to be at a
faster meet. It challenged us to
swim fast.”

The level of competition was
not the only challenge the Wildcats
faced, however.

“We were so uncertain for so
long about NICs (another champi-
onship in Southern Illinois where
they’ve historically finished their
season) or ECACs, and that was not

resolved until after Feb. 1, [when
the ECAC notified Davidson of their
admittance to the conference],”

Head Coach Rich DeSelm said. °

“Now we know where we’re going
next year. Nineteen of 20 athletes
will return (diver Michael Hart is
graduating), and that should make
for a more successful meet.”

Many Wildcat times were
slower than they had beentwo weeks
before at Southern States, but
DeSelm was pleased with their per-
formances.

“Tt’s hard to hold a taper, and
it’s difficult to repeat two weeks
later,’ DeSelm said. “We were fully
tapered for Southern States. There’s
also the emotional side. We were at
home, and the team title was on the
line. Southern States was very
hyped. That atmosphere was not
repeated.”

“Tt was pretty hard for me,”
Nelson said of the meet. “I had
never donea shaved meet two weeks
after another shaved meet, and I
didn’t know whatto expect. We had
to trust what Rich said, and hope it
worked.”

exam time or just for fun!
