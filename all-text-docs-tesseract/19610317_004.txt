THE DAVIDSONIAN has a
two-fold purpose as “The News
and Editorial! Voice” of the
campus. First, on its news
pages. it should accurately and
impartially report news of inter-
est covering all areas of campus
life. Secondly. on its editorial
pages only, it should take defi-
nite stands, which may or may
not reflect majority student
opinion.

The paper should be provoc-
ative. The editor should in-
vestigate, criticize construc-
tively and propose, with the
goals of achieving actions he
favors and stimulating readers
to question their opinions and
defend therm adequately. .

The paper must not be guilty
01 presenting only one side! I
will always print any construc-
tive. letter or article in agree.
ment or opposition with editorial
policy.

If elected, { promise to ap
proach issues as open-mindedly
and intelligently as [ am able.
Since each issue must be con-
sidered in its immediate con-
text, I cannot say what all my
stands will be. However, some
of my definite proposals are:

1—a much improved faculty
and curriculum are sorely
needed.

2—ine Tionor Cour‘'s study of
“diving,” pledged work and
stea!ing should be. continued and
positive action taken.

3—students should have a
greater voice in all matters di-
rectly concerning them.

4—literary activities and
other areas of the liberal arts
program need emphasis and
development like debating
and dramatics this year.

5—greater coverage should be
given intramural sports.

In three years on this paper’s
staff and three summers’ ex-
perience on daily papers, I have
become aware of the problems
and opportunities of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN. If elected, I prom-
ise a readable, alert paper each
Friday.

SAUNDERS

lf THE DAVIDSONIAN is to
fulfill its proper position on
campus, it must be an expres.
sion of all student opinion. Part
of the editor's job is to win the
respect of the student body for
its campus newspaper. This can
be accomplished, I believe, by
the following:

1. Establishing a ‘forum”-type
column on page two, where any
student may have the opportun-
ity to air gripes, present opin-
ions, and write full-fledged
articles on vital subjects.

2 Extending intramural
coverage, promoting the
IMAC, and continuing to pre
sent the most newsworthy
and interesting college ath-
letic news.

3. Catching pictures of the um-
usual and special events on
campus — in short, to enliven
and improve news picture-tak-
ing.

THE DAVIDSONIAN editor's
most important job, however, is
up to him, and is not left to the
technical assistants, now matter
how efficient. The editor must
take a firm editorial stand on;
major ‘campus issues, based on
thorough investigation.

The editorial column is not
the place to air personal bias:
this is unworthy of any news-
paperman. But the good edi-
tor gives generous amounts of
constructive criticism, merit- |
ed praise, and informed ,
opinion. |

Volume XL of THE DAVID-|
SONIAN will put in print some
28 copies of news and editorials.
New problems will have arisen.
Old problems, such as faculty
salaries, library expansions, and
the drinking rule will, no
doubt, continue to plague us

In these pages I hope, the way|

to progress can be indicated.

3% QUIPS AND CRANKS 3

No one Davidson student has
the ability to produce the Quips
‘n Granks. Such a task can be
accomplished only by a well-
chosen and_ carefully-guided
staff comprised of men especial-
ly qualified for their respective
jobs. Such a group is my plat-
form for next year’s editorship.

The photographer is one of
the key men on a staff since
the yearbook is, to « lerge
degree, a pictorial record of
the Davidson term. His skill
is vain, however, without the
idea man, whose job it is to
find or cregte for the photog-
rapher situations best repre-
senting various phases of
cempus activity.

But pictures themselves. speak
only so loud. Therefore, a comp-
etent copy editor is needed to
lend continuity to the yearbook
sections. A skilled photographer,
a fresh idea man, a prolific copy
editor brought together by care-
ful selection and guided by
valuable. experience will pro-
duce the annual if I am elected

More specifically, I advocate
four pages for each group in
the fraternity section. In addi-
tion to the composite pictures
which offer an invaluable aid to
rushing, this section needs snap-
shots portraying activity charac-
teristic of each fraternity.

An appealing beauty sec-
tion also needs to be included.
More emphasis should be
placed on the graduating
class, for in a sense, it is their
yearbook and the one to which
they will turn twenty-five
years hence.

Finally, by careful juggling
of funds, more colored pictures

spected voice on a progressive|ment the other colored aspects

Artist’s ‘Enigma’ Hangs
In Lobby Of Chambers

By JIMMY WILLIAMS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“I call this,” said Yarcy Robertson as he hung up a painting of a grotesquely
shaped bird surrounded by a livid yellow-orange sky, “ ‘Bird of Prey.’ I've been told
several times that it's positively repulsive, but it’s the technique and color of the paint-

ing that makes it beautiful.”

Robertson was busy Wednes-
day setting up his oneman
show which is currently on dis-
play in Chambers lobby.

“How long did it take you to
paint it?”, THE DAVIDSONIAN
asked.

“Oh, about fifty cups of cof.

fee,” came the reply.

Robertson, who is currently
Professor of Art at Winthrop
College, graduated from David-
son in 1953. He is the first grad-
uate in a decade to return for a
one-man show, and was asked
to come by Professor Moose in
conjunction with the “Fine Arts
Festival.” The theme of the
festival is “The South’s Contri-.
bution to Contemporary Arts.”

“Which of these is your fa
vorite?”

“The one over there called
‘Enigam’ and this ‘Sea Shape,’
Actually, | don’t like many
of the ones here. After work-
tng for a long time on one
painting, you soon get tired of
it. That's what keeps en
artist going. You’re never
really satisfied. Those which
are your favorites todsy will

pect it’s too dark.”

Since leaving Davidson, Rob-
ertson has studied English at
Duke. and spent four years at
the Boston Museum School of

Elliot Springs Exhibition, he

man shows in his home town of
Fayetteville, North Carolina.
THE DAVIDSONIAN also
asked him to comment on art
in the South. “So far as tal-
ent is concerned the Old
South didn’t produce great
artists simply because the
Southerners were more inter-
ested in ‘living the good life.’
As for the role of the artist
in general, Robertson comment.
ed, “An artist must speak his
own mind. He should tell the
truth as he sces it. But I believe

that in order to justify himself, |.

he must also be able to com-
municate his ideas.”

The Quips and Cranks should
be a publication that will vivid-
ly restore memories of past
events. I believe that the fol-
lowing proposals will accomplish
this end.

First, simplicity is a prime
factor. More use of descriptive
photography and less emphasis
on context gain my full support.
I have noticed that the trend in
university annuals has been to-
ward full utilization of this
method, for a picture captures
the particular event much more
effectively. Pictures limited to
aspects not truly representative
of college life should be re-
placed with pictures symbolic.
ally understandable to the whole
student body, faculty, and alum-
ni.

Secondly, coherence is a major
factor in publishing a top an-
nual. | propose that there be a
more effective method of tran-
sition used with emphasis on
the neglected sections, such as
faculty and honorary fratern.
ities. Faculty contacts with the
students are an integral part of
college life and should receive
more consideration. Honorary
fraternities and organizations
should have their purpose and
activities more clearly portray-
ed,

Thirdly, appeal can be ob-
tained if the members of the
Quips and Cranks staff have a
closer connection with the col-
lege activities throughout the
year, as does THE DAVIDSON-
IAN. Because of scope, the Quips
end Cranks’ final product can-
not be detailed. However, I
propose that the annual staff
gather material on the overall
aspects of numerous activities
throughout the year to enable
it to make the best selections
of material for the layout.

My past experience on the
Quips end Cranks staff, and ex-
perience as business manager
and editor of an annual a few
years ago give me confidence
that I could accomplish these
objectives. I would do my ut-
most to coordinate all phases of
anmual work to give Davidson
College a superior annual publi-
cation.

In my opinion, the Davidson
humor magazine lacks one es-
sential element — humor. What
humor that may have been pres-
ent has been gleaned from other
collegiate publications or from
past issues of Scripts ‘n Pranks
when its staff had no difficulty
being original.

it seems to me that if Da-
vidson possesses the calibre of
students that it boasts, there

should be enough creative
ability present to publish four
original issues of a truly
humorous humor magazine.

The Vagabonds have shown
that student participation and
enthusiasm can be rekindled
among the pseudo-intelligentsia
of our campus. Seripts ‘n Pranks
can follow this example by en-
couraging those students who

possess fresh, creative writing; More talente

ability to contribute to the
magazine. This in turn might
stimulate the literary societies
to revive their extinct publica-
tions and in so doing relieve
Scrips ‘n Pranks of the burden
of its dual role as both a humor
and a literary magazine.

This would leave more time
and space to be devoted fo the
primary purpose of the maga-
zine — humor.

Like so many organizations at
Davidson, Seripts ‘n Pranks
has isolated itself from the in-
terests and desires of the stu-
dent body. Since student funds
finance the publication, it seems

(Continued In Column 8)

Gentlemen, let’s face _ it:
Scripts ‘n Pranks is suf-
fering from schizopirenia. To
be scripts or to be pranks. Now
let's examine the situation.
Davidson obviously can't support
literary effort and its borrowed,
sick humor in separate publica-
tions. The twain must meet.

The focal Byronic heroes
cannot function according to’
time tables or the like—dead
lines are a curse of the bour-
geois.

So, the local outlet must not
serve only as an outlet but must
manage to inspire someone.
This might be done by hiring a
few muses to sit in on meetings.

Something should come of it,
anyway. For original humor
(sick or otherwise) we can send
writers to the classes of the
d wits of the col-

lege. Someone has to attend

jtheir classes.

Though I haven't followed
any mad urges to take the local
version of psychology. experi-
ence has given me a certain in-

phrenia. I certainly wouldn’t try
to solve it, normal magazines
like normal people are dull and
dry.

So, | propose to give the
magazine some more  psy-
choses (whether | win or no).
Now I shan‘t be out to shock.
Oh no. | shall be out for
quality. if we're all going
crazy, let’s do it in style.

Richardson Scholars Act
As Delegates To LU.N.A.

By KOOKIE KAPOOR
Richardson Scholar

Five of Davidson’s Richard-
son Scholars were delegates to
the Little United Nations Assem-
bly — an exact replica of the
U. N. — held at Indiana Uni-
versity from March 8-11.

Wolfgang Mayerhofer, Kookie
Kapoor, Arnold Kroner, Per
Leander, and Richard Dawids
posed as members of the Aus-
trian and Luxembourg delega-

tions. University students from
all over the United States were
‘given the responsibility of rep-
resenting a country other than
their own. This gave them an
opportunity to come into close
contact with the problems and
difficulties which another coun-
try faces.

\ The L.U.N.A. is held to give
participants a deeper and truer
| insight into the many and varied
complexities of the inner mec-
hanism of the United Nations.
,L.U.N.A. provides the most
fundamental essential of the
U.N. — acknowledgement of the
fact that mankind is locked in

Sight in this problem of schizo- a common destiny, and the

action of every nation is going to
be either an encouraging or re-
tarding factor in mankind's
striving for peace.

The Richardson Scholars who
attended the Assembly felt that
it was characterized by vigorous
and enthusiastic participation.
Flattery, exchange of hollow
courtesies, verbal gymnastics,
political witticisms, and usual
entourage of a political assembly

were very much in evidence.

The delegation from Cuba,
led by “Mr. Castro” in disguise,
was a faithful reproduction of
the popular concept. Decked out
in military dress, brandishing
beards, the delegation made a
dramatic entrance, then pro-
ceeded directly to the Russian
bloc and gave an animated dis-
play of exchanging courtesies.

The resolution for the admis-
sion of Red China, tabled by
India, was defeated by an ex-
tremely narrow margin — 26
against, 25 in favor.

An atmosphere of earnestness
and urgency prevailed, and one
could not help but realize the
tremendous beating the U. N.
suffers from certain dissident
and irreconcilable elements.

only just that the student should
receive issues which suit his
taste.

I would like to have a survey
taken to determine what the
Davidson student would like in
his humor magazine. Seripts ‘n
Pranks must be a humor maga-
zine for the students and by the
students.

Bright idea with a glowing future |

At Gen Tel, research ‘is put to work to advance
communications through sight as well gs sound.

The dial of our compact Svancite* phone, for
example, utilizes an entirely new source of light

that marks a milestone in visual communications.
Called Panecescent® (electroluminescent) lighting,
it produces light without heat, has no bulb to turn ,

on and off, and costs less than 1¢ a year for
electricity.

Pioneered and developed by the Lighting Products
Division of our subsidiary, Sylvania, this dramatic
new light opens up almost infinite product possi-
bilities in sight communication. Already it is being
used for clock faces, radio dials, auto instrument
panels and road signs.
And, through the development of an ingénious
“crose grid” design, electrotuminescent panels are
now capable of reproducing alpha-numeric “read-
oute” for electronic computers. Thijs achievement,
in fact, may one day lead to “flat Wall” TV,

(t Is another example of the way General Telephone
& Electronics coordinates the scientific and engi-
neering leadership of many divisions In order to
make communications progress on all fronts.
