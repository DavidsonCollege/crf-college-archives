tion of the Week is worded as fol-
lows: What Suggestion For A New
Cut System Would You Make?

Ted Parker, Junior:

If any change is to be made in
the present system, I think that
it should follow these lines: Fresh-
men ought to have no cuts during
the first six weeks of college, for,
in this time many of those who
unintentionally get off to a bad
start would have a better chance.
After the first six weeks’
allow the Freshmen two cuts in
each subject on which a C grade
or better has been made. Allow the
Freshmen three cuts in each course

report,

during the second semester. As for
the sophomores, allow them three
cuts in each course per semester.

R. Archer Torrey, Senior:

* The ideal is unlimited cuts for the
three upper classes with no cuts for
the freshmen while getting orient-

ated to the new system, A transi-
tion period would only make it
seem that cuts are to be taken,
which, theoretically, is not true.

However, the Southern Association
requires cuts to be limited to four

in a class, hence, no material
change can be made without los-
ing our rating.

I would like to see the Dean's

list maintained in some form, how-

Bill Bolin, Junior:

I believe that the cut system is
all right as it is at present though
one improvement should be made.
That is: overcutting is abused and
I believe the punishment for the

Arch Taylor, Freshman:

Since it seems quite evident that
the system must be changed, I|
feel that it would be all right to
limit freshman and perhaps sopho-
more cuts to two in each class, but
the Dean’s list should in no wise
be abolished, though the require-
ments might be raised. However,
I see nothing wrong with the pres-
ent arrangement. é

ing. Possible maximum of six cuts
in each class for A students. This
maximum might be lowered for
Freshmen and Sophomores or rais-

ed for Juniors and Seniors.

Bob Kellogg, Junior:

If the present cut system must be
changed to a more stringent basis
I would suggest raising the re-
quirements for attaining the Dean’s
list and leaving the rest of the sys-
tem at its present standing. I feel
cramped to air my views in this
space because it is obvious that
the student views have no status

Ed Watson, Sophomore:

It that the
cut system which has been in,op-

eration for the past years has been
abused by student’s overcutting,
but in my opinion this fact does
not call for the strenuous cut sys-
tem that the Faculty has just pass-
ed.

My suggestion is that freshmen
and sophomores be limited to’ two
cuts in each class per semester,
and that juniors and seniors be al-
lowed three cuts in each class per
semester with the severest penali-
ties imposed for overcutting. Also,
the Dean’s list could be kept by
raising the required grade.
