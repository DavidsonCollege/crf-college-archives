Question of |
The Week

Last ‘year there was much talk
of anew "Alma Mater” for David

to write one and play it over. the
radio. Several other suegested songs
were taken undér considera

nay be that the student body and
faculty would prefer to have our
football’ song, “O. Davidson!" con
tinue to serve as Alma Mater
There appear to be good: reasons
for not doing this, but we would
like to know the general feeling on
this subject. “Do you want one of

the suggested songs to be chosen
as a new Alma Mater for David-
son, or would you rather have, ‘O,
Davidson!’
such?”
Lyman J. Parrigin, Sophomore:

I am positively in favor of an
Alma Mater song for Davidson. “O,
Davidson” is a swell fight song,
but I do not believe that it has all
the qualities of an Alma Mater
hymn. The student body should

reach some decision, and that soon,

continue to serve as

as to whether or not we are to have
an Altha Mater song. If the stu-
dents vote definitely that they want
an ‘Alma Mater steps
can be taken to choose an appropri-

song, then

ate one. But let’s come to some de-
cision in the matter.

Craig Schmidt, Sophomore:
I] think that Davidson, like. other

schools, can and should have two
Alma Maters—a pep tune-or a
march liké “O, Davidson" and a
hymn for-more solemn occasions.

For this hymn TE gvould suggest Dr
Maxwell's “All Hail, Oh David-
