Stand alone with friends

ot one person who is reading

this article wants to. You’ve
all been bombarded by too many
“beginning of college freshman ex-
perience” (read without a pause for
full effect) articles. Freshman are
tired of hearing about how scary or
wonderful everything is, and up-
perclassmen would like to begin
moving on with
the rest of their
semester, thank
you very much.
Indulge me for a
few moments by
reading, not about what college will
be like, but about what it won’t be
like.

You’ ve left home and come, or
come back, to Davidson. That isn’t
earthshaking, but what is is that the
home you left and the home you
will return to are not the same places.
How many times have you heard a
relative who has not seen you for a
long time remark how much you
have changed? Absence acceler-
ates and illuminates change. You
can carry the place that home was in
your heart, but if you try to go back

No RELATION To THE Gym

and refill your memories with its
waters, you will find that the spring

_ has dried up and moved. You can-

not anchor yourself in the memo-
ries of the past.

To survive you must anchor
yourself within yourself. Standing
on the comforting, but slightly sti-
fling, fog of the past is only slightly
less diffi-
cult than
carving a
stepin the
liquid fu-
ture. You
are in the present. You must stand
on present; it is all that you can see.
To Stand in the present, however,
you need to use your own feet.
Without yourself you are lost. Col-
lege is not a time to depend more
heavily upon others. It is a time to
realize the strength that you carry
within yourself and use it.

Having said that, isolation is
nota viable alternative. You cannot
stand alone forever: All of the.great
monuments of humanity are testa-
ments to this.

To endure you must have the

internal strength to stand on your

‘own. While developing yourself,

you must learn to find friends.
Friends, true friends, are those
people who if their faces weren’t
different from yours, they would be
you. They know you better than
you know yourself. Because of
these stringent qualifications, most
people are extremely fortunate if
they find two such people in 4 life-
time. The rest of us should be so
lucky as to have one.

The rest of the people whom
you meet in life are transients, tem-
porary props who support you and
are supported by you for short
amounts of time. Most of the people
that you’ Il meet you will never know
into which category they fell until
long afterwards. Don’t ever judge
someone too quickly—they may be
your best friend waiting to be dis-
covered.

Some of this article was bor-
ing, and maybe some of it was funny,

_ but you made it, and perhaps you’ re

a little wiser for the trip.
Who says college or life is any
more than this?

The cruelty

here’s just something about an

empty post office box that
makes you want to cry. The soli-
tude and desolation of that empty
slot, walls punctuated by the light
of the mail room behind it, can
tarnish a perfectly quaint afternoon.
It is the pinnacle of both human
expectation and mortal devastation.

Af - Oo
ter two
weeks of
slow
mail, I
have
reached ©
several conclusions about the soci-
etal iniquities of post offices, so let
me share. First of all, the march to
the post office is utterly ridiculous.
It must take at least five minutes to
reach the post office from most stu-
dent dormitories. This is college;
we don’t have time to walk that far
just to look into a dirty old post
office box only to find that we have
once again been forgotten by all
that we hold dear to our hearts.
With this in mind, I see only one
plausible course of action: the
Vamanos Van.
"Secondly, I have found that
many students, often of the femi-
nine persuasion, feel the need to be
accompanied to the post office. I
don’t know if this concept is some-

how psychologically attune to pair-
ing-off for bathroom trips, but I just
don’t understand it. Granted, after
watching the eye-opening safety
video during orientation, it just
might be a good idea to request a
police escort.

Which brings us to point num-
ber three: while I have come to
appreciate and respect
the courtesy of
Davidson motorists, I
am at this point not
confident enough to
throw myself in front
of oncoming traffic
and hope that the approaching ve-
hicles will stop. Though I have
watched many of my colleagues
successfully achieve this feat, I just
don’t think I’m ready. Thus, I am
resolved to stand on the sidewalk,
edging onto the pavement ever-so-
slowly, turning my head back and
forth, right and left, as though
plagued with paranoia. Again, my
suggestion, the Vamanos Van.

Finally, and most important, -

the crowd scene of mail hour at the
post office opens up one up to pub-

lic humiliation. This type of social .

embarrassment is known as “the
musical chair syndrome.”

Let me explain. I refuse to play
musical chairs. It is demeaning and
humiliating. Here I was at a fellow

five-year-old’s birthday party, lis-
tening to some seriously rockin’
music like “Old McDonald,” when
all of the sudden this kid’s mom
decided to turn it off and everyone
jumped into a chair! And where
was I? Standing in the middle look-
ing dazed and confused. Such child-
hood memories can mark an indi-
vidual with a lacking self-concept,
and such is the scene at the post
office.

To save myself from further
embarrassment, I have developed a
simple method. First, before open-
ing the box, peek through the
airholes to check for any shadow-
ing. If this does not prove helpful,
and you happen to have keen olfac-
tory senses, it is possible to sniff for
envelope glue, though it may later
prove harmful. Finally, remember
to leave through the side door if
you’ve had an unsuccessful day.
This keeps you from facing the long
line of package-receivers in the main
office. If none of this helps, try
visiting at midnight.

So as the days roll by and the
mailbox scene oscillates, remem-
ber these few helpful tips and kee
the faith.

For mailbox love is like all
other true passion: though it comes
only once ina lifetime, it feels damn
good while it lasts.

Salting your beef |

row. Do we even have time to fit
tomorrow into our schedules? Col-
lege has turned into a time of caf-
feine addiction and bragging about
how few hours of sleep one got the
night before, the number of “com-
mitments” one has instead of a re-
flective time to see where we have
been thus far and where we want to
go.

I have returned from an inspir-
ing summer, and I have many
thoughts and ideas that I want to put
into action. I imagine that many of
us here have that kind of enthusi-
asm. Everyone seems to have a
growing list of priorities. I remem-
ber filling out college applications
in which I had to categorize all of

the activities I did. This induces.a —

mentality that there are certain
“things” that everyone needs to do
to become the ideal Davidson stu-
dent. Davidson’s statement of pur-

The concept of diminishing
returns is so relevant to time man-
agement. The more we do, the less
we getout of these activities. When-
ever I say noto something, I wonder
what opportunities I am missing out
on. How could I have grown from
this experience that I am now deny-
ing myself? .

Other areas of the world under-
stand time differently. This sum-
mer in Paraguay, I felt like I wasn’t
using my talents when I just sat
around. But I had time to think; I
had time to be myself and nothing
more. The Protestant work ethic

We are genuinely happy for

help but wonder how they would

dorms. Coed for 1WB,

dorms offer students the opportu-
nity to socialize without pressure.
After one grows accustomed to liv-
ing with men, she realizes that there
is a certain element of friendship
between them. For example, the
members of 1WB and First East
Belk (LEB) have formed a unique
relationship which no member of a
single-sex dorm could possibly un-
derstand without experiencing it.

There isn’t a night that goes by
when the men and women of First
Belk can’t be found talking, laugh-

-ing, watching T.V., or even study-

ing together. First Belk represents
friendship and unity between the
sexes which is essential to the “fresh-
man experience.”

With this in mind, we encour-
age the girls of Watts, Rich, and
Belk to venture forth and develop
strong bonds with their male coun-
terparts. As for the single-sex
dorms, we can’t help but wish you

we have no complaints.

After all, how can we argue
with seeing the poetic First East
Belk in their towels day and night?

Finally, | WB wants it known
that we willalways try to exhibit the
ultimate display of hall unity. Our
newly-developed friendships, team
Spirit, and enthusiasm have helped
us adjust to college life and under-
stand that this experience is about
much more than studying and par-
tying. We hope youall will become
involved with your hall, attended
the mixers and hall activities, and
support your hallmates. Remember
the adage “there is stength in num-
bers.” Hall spirit has been pounded
into us by our wonderful hall coun-
selors, and we hope everyone else
will catch the spirit as well.

Finally, don’t forget ta play in
your hall’s flickerball games. 1WB
will be there in full force to show
you what it’s all about.
