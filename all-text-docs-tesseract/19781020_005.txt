To the Kalter:

Having been at Davidson for
six weeks, and having seen’ the
school function in its. daily life,
biased as we may be, we see the
office of international education

as being one of the most.
important institutions on cam~

pus.

We have both travelled wide-
ly, as have the other interna-
tional students. We all see the
benefits of international mate
action.

The Davidson international
program affords Davidson stu-
dents a unique opportunity to

Letter to the Editor

Sig Eps protest

To the Editor:

The brothers of Sigma Phi
Epsilon wish to take exception
to the reference made
our feelings toward President
Spencer (Spencer's First De-
cade, The Davidsonian, 13 Oc-
tober 1978), and our attitude
toward the present social sys-
tem at Davidson.

The ‘‘bitter”’ feelings attribu-
ted us were perhaps true to
some extent in 1971,. when
present brothers were in grade
school, but are in no way indica-
tive of our feelings today. We as
a group fully support the admi-
nistration and the present social
system, and in no way hold any
feelings of bitterness or malice
toward President Spencer,

It is our understanding that
the writer of the article in ques-
tion was referring to isolated
incidents that occured at one of
the eating clubs on campus last
year, which were then extrapo-
lated to include the views of the
entire brotherhood!

The author did not once
address the leaders of our group
for a statement, because as we
understand it, he ‘‘...didn’t feel
it was necessary.’ We see this
type of reporting as analogous
to a scientist accepting for truth
a result occurring once in a
thousand trials. It just. doesn’t
make good sense.

The Sig Eps have worked
actively in the past several:
years to erase a stereotyped
image that was a carryover
from the early seventies: the
image of a group of radicals who
administration, and who had
little respect for people outside
their own group and even less
respect for the workings of the
social system.

Through graduation our
group has lost.the members
responsible for this image, and
feels that now it is an image.
unjustly applied by some people
who have formulated their opi-
nion.on hearsay and not on our
recent actions. Our operations
off campus are in the spirit and’

study in Europe and abroad,
while gaining valuable exper-

ience and academic credits. But -
for international students on -

campus, the exchange program
is a “one-way ticket.”” For none
of the international group gain-
official recognition of their
grades obtained here when they
return to their shige aba univ-
ersities.

Hanafi (Pakistan; Cotignenc
(France) and Okomba (Kenya)
have already obtained degrees,
while Weitz (Germany) has stu-
died for four years at his univ-
ersity and Chadwick (United

for the good of the entire
campus community. Included
in these contributions are:

--A speaker series by David-
son professors held nearly every
week at our house, where every-

one is invited and the professor —

presents a program on a topic of
interest to him, and informal
discussion follows;

--A campus wide.dance mara-
thon for the American Cancer
Society which provided an acti-
vity open to all students and
which raised over $600.00 for a
worthy charity.

With events such as these,

Thus the exchange i is empha-
sized for all the international
students as being'a cultural

Primarily we are not here just
to do academic work, but more
importantly we are here to
learn. To learn the customs,
learn the language, to savor
the American educational ex-
perience, and to better under-
stand the American way of life.

Last week’s article gave a
devastatingly wrong image of

some of the initeriiehibatil stu-
dents. Weitz is quoted as
saying, ‘I’m not, here to study.
I can do that in ‘Europe...

Taken as it was out of context

some of the exchange students
are just here for a holiday and
have no intention of working.
Chadwick stated last week
“that the program was more of
a cultural than an academic
exchange.” The fact that inter-
national students are only re-
quired to take two courses per
term is a recognition by the

stereotyped image

benefit everyone involved with.
Davidson.

In relation to the author's
statement concerning the
“kindness” of the present sys-
tem of ‘‘self-selection,’’ one does
not have to look far to see

instances of ‘‘selectivity” being |

practiced in the ‘‘rush’’ proces-
ses carried on by some of the
houses on’ campus, which have
led to a number of injustices
within the system. At present,
true ‘‘self-selection’’ is not ‘al-
ways the rule. ‘

In our opinion, competitive
rushing should. not wear the
cloak of hypocrisy, but can be

carried out successfully within
our social system, which does
contain alternatives equally sa-
tisfying to the person not
interested in a fraternal organi-

zation.

In view of the misunderstan-
ding caused by the reference in
said article, the brothers of
Sigma Phi Epsilon wish to reaf-
firm that the view cited is not
the view held by the present
brothers, who regard President
Spencer very highly.

for Third World marketing

By STEVE AUSTIN
PIRG Columnist

The Nestle Corporation, in-
ternational producer of choco-
late and other items, is coming
under fierce attack for its
marketing of milk formula for
infants.

In an effort to increase pro-
fits, the company is exploiting
the citizens of several under-
developed nations. —

E Davidson PIRG:

“There is but one small
problem—the people have no
need for the product. What was
industry’s response? Create
one! A massive sales campaign
now appeals to caring parents’
desires to give their child the
best available. It encourages
poor mothers to abandon breast
feeding for a more expensive
and ultimately less healthful
alternative.

“Twenty years ago in Chile
95 percent of all mothers breast
fed their babies beyond the first
year. Now the practice has been
virtually abandoned.
