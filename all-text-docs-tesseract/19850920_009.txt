Undergoing a more subtley-
publicized orientation than the
freshmen, 17 new professors and
visiting lecturers have begun work
at Davidson this fall. They repre-
sent a diverse group of interests
and experiences.

Bulgaria Jack Perry recently
joined the Davidson Community
as Director of the Dean Rusk Pro-
gram In International Studies and
as Professor of Political Science.

' Perry’s chief responsibility is
directing the Dean Rusk Program.
One of the its primary goals is to
give each student a chance to be-
come more internationally aware
in at least one area. “The pro-

gram,” said Perry, “is not a ~

‘major,’ but instead is here to en-
hance the international dimension
of a Davidson education.” The
program has already sponsored a
discussion on South African prob-
lems, led by former missionaries
to South Africa. This Monday, the
Program will sponsor a speech led
by Peter Bridges, U.S. Ambas-
sador to Somalia, on U.S. policy
toward South Africa.
In his role as political science
rofessor,

and East European politics.

Georgia. He attended Mercer Uni-
versity from 1947-1951, where he

a reporter for the Associated Press
and the Macon Telegraph.

From 1959-1983, Perry was
employed in the U.S. Foreign Ser-
vice, where he served in a number
of distinctive positions. He spent
time on the staff of four European
embassies, was Special Assistant
to the Chairman of the Council on
Environmental Quality from
1972-74, was Deputy Chief of
Mission in U.S. Embassies in
Prague and Stockholm from 1974-
78, served as Deputy Executive
Secretary to the State Department
from 1978-79, and as U.S. Am-
bassador to Bulgaria from 1979-
81.

Upon retiring from the For-
eign Service in 1983, Perry served
as John C. West Professor of Gov-
ernment and International Studies

pleting work for her PHD from
Emory University. Hill-David-
son, who is married and has one
step-daughter, views her role at
Davidson, not only as an instruc-
tor, but also as a support for
minority students. She hopes to
achieve this support by providing
services which promote multi-cul-
tural education. Her interests in-
clude jazz, third-world literature
and multi-ethnic cooking.

Professor Ecoff

Ecoff is a visiting assistant
professor of chemistry here for the
1985-86 school year. He com-
pleted undergraduate work at the
University of Missouri-Rolla, re-
ceived his master’s degree from
San Diego State University and

orado.

He currently teaches Chemis-
try 21 (The Science of Chemistry)
which includes lectures and lab
work in the Martin Chemistry
Building. Ecoff has a variety of
interests including chess, back-
packing and playing piano.

Christopher Bell has joined
the economics department this
year.

Bell teaches a section of
Economics 101, ‘Introduction to
Political Economy,’ and
Economics 123, ‘Industrial Or-

§ ganization.’ Although Bell and

his wife Esther Robbins (who is
earning her MA from Temple
University) found it somewhat

f

difficult to move to the Southeast
after living in the West most of
their lives, they enjoy the friendli-
ness and concern they find at
Davidson. Professor Bell Came to
Davidson largely because of its
unique setting, and expresses en-
thusiasm at the idea of getting in-
volved in the community life here.
“One of my classes has already
challenged one of Susan Keefe’s
classes to a softball game,” he
said.

Originally from Albany,
California, he spent two and a half
years at Whitman College in
Walla Walla, Washington before
transferring to the University of
California at Berkeley to complete
his undergraduate degree in
economics and political science.
After working as a_ research
analyst at Stanford Research Cen-
ter in Palo Alto, he entered
graduate school at the University
of Pennsylvania. He earned his
MA from Penn in 1982, and he ex-
pects to receive his PhD during the
course of this term or the next.

He is particularly interested in
the organization of economic ac-
tivity, and he hopes to engage in
further study of questions relating
to the internal organization of
firms, the duties of different levels
of government, and diversifica-
tion in particular industries.

Bell’s personal interests are
many and varied, including back-
packing, fishing, rock and moun-
tain climbing, skiing, rafting, and
indeed “. .. practically every-
thing you can do outdoors.” He
also enjoys softball and wood-
working and hopes to join a soccer
club at Davidson soon.
