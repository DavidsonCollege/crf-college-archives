Christmas Fund Revives

Meaningful Tradition

To all members of the Davidson College community :

On behalf of the Davidson-Cornelius Day Care Center I thank
you for your generosity and concern in designating your Christ-
mas Gift Fund for use by the Center.

As you know, the Center serves 40 children from one-parent
families or from families where both parents work. These
families pay a fair share of the cost-of-care of these children,
but much of the expense of operating the Center must be ob-
tained from individual gifts and grants from foundations and
industries.

Your gift of approximately $1500 is a significant part of the
$25,000 needed this year. With your help, along with that of
others, we are moving towards achievement of our goal and the
assurance of quality child’ care for families in Davidson and
Cornelius.

I also want to express my pleasure in seeing the revival of a
good tradition. In years past, the Davidson College Christmas
Gift Fund has been a significant force for good in this com-
munity and in other places in the U.S. and abroad.

Those individuals and organizations who initiated and im-
plemented this revival are to be congratulated.

Again, thanks! !

Councils Begin Liaison
. the need for increased student

The recently-implemented
Departmental Advisory Coun-
cils are now ready to function
as liaisons between students
and the faculty members of
their respective departments.

Instituted in the fall of 1973
by action of the SGA Senate
Executive Committee, the
councils are the product of the
planning of Seniors Todd
Eades and Bo Phillips who felt

input in the academic depart-
ments.

According to its size, each
department has been assigned
by the Senate an advisory
council consisting of one, two
or three students. It is hoped
that the councils will provide
a valuable service, informing
faculty and students in the
departments of each other’s
suggestions and criticism.

Specifically, the councils

Fluent German Helps
Kyle Secure Rhodes

By ANNE PELFREY
Staff Writer

Davidson Senior Pete Kvle
has won a Rhodes Scholar-
ship. the most prestigious
graduate study scholarship
award available to American
college students. This week.
he discussed the application
and interview processes that
he completed to win the
scholarship.

“I'd always known that the

Rhodes Scholarship existed.
but until this fall, the thought
never occured to me to ap-
ply,’ he said, “In fact, I
probably wouldn't have ap-
plied if Brown Patterson
hadn't encouraged me to do
so.”’
Kyle said that early in the
fall, Professor of History
Brown Patterson suggested
that he apply, in view of his
particularly high grade-point
average and his experiences
on the JYA program in Mar-
burg, Germany last year.
Kyle had been appointed
assistant to his mathematics
professor at Marburg last
year.

“} never thought I'd get
one, but I felt that if I didn't
apply, I would probably kick
myself later. It’s a once-in-a-
lifetime shot.”

When asked why he wanted
the scholarship, Kyle said that
he had so enjoyed his previous
year in a European university
that he wanted to return for
graduate study. He also men-
tioned that the prospects of
studying for a year at Oxford
especially excited him.

‘‘The German university ex-
perience was very different
from what I had known at
Davidson, naturally, but the
English educational system
differs from both. I think it will
be better than both.

Whereas his studies at
Davidson had been closely
supervised by faculty mem-
bers, at Marburg Kyle found
himself completely on _ his
own.

‘‘Students at Marburg get no
personal attention. Lectures

departmental requirements,
the addition of new courses
and the dropping of old ones in
the curriculum, and the sub-
jects of prospective seminars.

In one instance, the students
of the Mathematics Advisory
Council have already met and
are discussing a possible pre-
calculus course or some other
alternative to Calculus 25 as
the first required mathemat-
ics course.

SGA President Blain Rutner
expressed optimism regar-
ding the advisory councils,
emphasizing their general
communicative possibilities.

“The only thing lacking now
is the student reaction. We
know students have criticism
and these councils will serve
as a means to extract it. The
same also applies from the
faculty side of the picture.” he
said.

‘The idea has a lot of poten-
tial,” he concluded, *‘most of
the professors I've talked to

are on a non-mandatory non-
credit basis and the only con-
tact with the faculty is through
seminars. An Oxford course of
study though. is based on the
tutorial concept. There's a
great deal of contact with youn
professors and that’s what
particularly interests me."’ he
explained.

Kyle plans to study logic at
Oxford and eventually return
to the United States to com-
plete a doctorate’ in
mathematics. He hopes to en-
ventually teach on the college
level.

Applicants for the Rhodes
are evaluated on the bases of a
written essay and their per-
formance in two separate in-
terviews, one at the state level
and one at the district level.
Kyle explained that the essay
was to be quasi-auto-
biographical, in which the
applicant was to state and dis-
cuss his interests. experiences
and career aims.

From the information in the
essay, the interviewing boards
prepared questions pertinent
to each individual applicant
and in this sense, customize
each interview.

“The state level interview
was a fairly low-pressure one.
The board inquired further
about my interests and future

plans. | suppose they wanted

to find out what type of person
I am. But the district inter-
view was very pressurized.

‘They knew I had been in
Marburg so they began the in-
terview in German and that
took me by complete surprise.
They asked me to discuss the
history of the university at
Marburg and later to discuss
the impact of Napoleon and
Bismark on German
education. all of this in Ger-
man and they expected me to
reply in German,” he said.

Kyle pointed out that the
strategy of the district in-
terviewing board was to ask
very detailed questions in the
applicant's field to see how
much he knew and to see how
he would react under that sort
of pressure.

The district interviewing
board consisted of sevenmem-
bers, each being responsible
for the questioning of two ap-
plicants. Each board member
would prepare questions from
his two applicant's essays and
conduct the major portion of
their interviews.

‘In one instance, I was a bit
lucky. During the plane ride to
the competition, I was reading
about Galileo and one of the
questions asked’ in the in-
terview concerned Galileo's
telescope.
