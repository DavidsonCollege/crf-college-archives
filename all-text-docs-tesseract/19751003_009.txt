Defense Back Mike Harding att-

Cats mauled by Kaydeds
face Guilford Saturday

Ronnie Moore took the
opening kickoff 89 yards for a
Keydet touchdown, and the
momentum never ended as the
VMI Keydets swamped
Davidson by a score of 55-0 in
the homecoming game at Lex-
ington Virginia.

VMI, now 1-2, diersaved
the talent and strength which
many feel will carry them to a
second straight Southern
Conference Championship.

The Keydet offense, led by
quarterback Mark Lambert
and running back Andre
Gibson, rolled up 412 yards
total offense against a David-
son defense, which spent more
than its share of the game on
the field.

The VMI defense, led by
reserve end, Steve Lawrence,
and back-up line backer John

Dribbling over GPA

Hobbs, held the young Wild-
cat offense to only 42 senee
total offense.

Davidson started three
freshmen on the offensive unit
and played a total of seven
freshmen, all of which were
backfield men except for tight
end Larry Crees.

“After viewing the VMI

films, we saw some bright
spots to build on and we still
plan to be a good football
team,’’ said Davidson head
coach Ed Farrell. ‘‘One of the
bright spots was our determ-
ination to play when the game
was out of reach. We held our
own physically, but were

The Davidson Wildcats,
still smarting from last week’s
55-0 loss to VMI, will try to
turn things around when they
face Guilford in their home
opener Saturday.

Brickels initiates sports study hall

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Staff Writer

After a strong recruiting
season, head basketball coach
Bo Brickels is faced with the
problem of helping his fresh-
man players adjust to the
Davidson academic program.

As a result, the coaching
staff has formulated a new
academic program to make
sure the players can handle
both their school work and
basketball practice. All play-
ers except seniors have a
group study session for two
hours Sunday through Thurs-
day and have been urged by
the coaches to keep class cuts
to a minimum.

The basketball staff is also
keeping in communication
with the players’ professors to

check for possible problems in - a

the classroom. It is Brickels’
philosophy that if a player
does well in his school work,
he will be a better athlete.

“We there is a
strong carry-over between
what happens in the class and
what happens in the gym. The
biggest thing is getting the
guys used to setting aside
some time for studying,’’ he
said,

believe

Previously the coaching
staff had not closely followed
the players academic careers.
In fact, last. year Kevin
Dougherty did not meet fresh-
man composition require-
ments and had to do so during
the summer.

“If I had used this program
last year I would have known

about Kevin and could have

done something to help him,”
pointed out Brickels.

“Also if there were just a
few freshmen involved we
probably would just pick some

of the players and suggest

that they study at a certain
time. But it’s important that
the freshmen understand how
to study and realize how much
time it takes.”’

Other colleges will often
provide tutors for their athle-
tes who are having difficulty

in their studies. But Brickels

sees no need for this policy at
Davidson.

If a player does well aca-
demically , completing the year
with a GPA or 3.00 or better,
he will not be required to
attend the group study ses-
sions the following year.

Organized practice is not
allowed by NCAA regulations
until October 15, so Brickels
has, his team involved in a
conditioning program of long
distance running, sprints and
weight lifting.

One notable exception from
the conditioning program is
senior guard Jay Powell, who
is on probation until the end of
the fall quarter. He will miss
five weeks of practice and how
he fits into plans for the

* season is not definite.

“All of our plans have Jay
in the background,” said Bric-

An integral part of both the

study and training programs.

working as a group and get-

before practice starts.

Kickoff for this non-conf- «
erence game is 2 p.m. at
Richardson Field.

While the Wildcats were
having their troubles in Virg-
inia, Guilford was improving
its record to 3-1 with a 17-6
win over powerful Elon.

In last year’s contest, the

Quakers defeated Davidson by
a score of 31-14 on their way to
a 6-3-2 record, which included
a Poultry Bowl victory over
William Penn of Iowa..:.
- Guilford’s offense is led by
halfback Billy Whitley, who
rushed for more than 800
yards in 1974, and tackle
Steve Musulin, a Little
All-American candidate.

Their defense is led by
middle guard, Bunky James, a
1974 all-Carolinas Conference

choice.
“We learned to respect them

last year,” remarked David-
son head coach Ed Farrell.
“James is as good a defensive
player as we will see all year.
Whitley is a real threat in a
balanced offense.

“We know we will be in a
tough football game,’’ Farrell
added. ‘‘Our primary concern
is to correct as many mistakes
as we can and to be in the
thick of things Saturday.’’

The Wildcats will open with
the same lineup as last week
with safety Jim Nichols and

‘linebacker Roger Whitley

heading up the defense, and
freshman quarterback Bill
Wolar directing the offense.
