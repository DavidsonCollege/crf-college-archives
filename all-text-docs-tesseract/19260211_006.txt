Under the direction of Coaches Tilson and |

Mattox, some eighty men have been going |
through the rudiments of fundamental foot- |
ball on the practice fields for the past week. |
With a nucleus of about 13 letter men |
around which the Wildcat machine of next |
fall is to be built, these mentors, ably assisted |
by-several Seniors who will be sadly missed |
during the coming season, are rapidly whip-
ping into shape thre or four creditable teams. |

Following the custom of several years, the |
squad has been divided into two groups which |
will be pitted against cach other after a week |
or two more of hard training. Last spring |
when these men had been through three |
weeks of gruelling training, a contest with |
Hickory Athletic Club was played on Rich- |
ardson field. Although Davidson won this |
game by a top-heavy score, it gave the |
coaches an insight into the progress Bd
during this spring period.

Although a number of men have found |
the pace too stiff, the outstanding performers |
of both the varsity and freshman squads of |
the past season are still answering the roll
call.

Scrimmage will be in order the latter part |’

of the week, the coaches then will be given
an opportunity to see what progress has been
made.

The Wildcats of a season or more, aided
by this year’s freshmen, will be cogs in the
same type of machine that his always been
the custom of Davidson.

A. P, Ormond, ’21, who graduated from
the Pennsylvania Medical School last
June, is serving his internship at the Phil-
adelphia General Hospital. His friends
may address him at 34th and Pine Sts.,
Philadelphia.

PLACE SEATS SOON

The class of '26 will give the col-
lege cight benches as their annual gift,
which are to be placed between the
trees along the walks. The Galloway
Terra Cotta Company, of Philadel-
phia, will design the benches especially
for Davidson. They will be of the
Grecian style of architecture, having
neither backs nor arm rests. The tops
of the benches will be made of slabs of
white limestone. The supports will be
of red terra cotta. Each bench will be
54 inches long, 20 inches high, and
20 inches wide. “1926” will be en-
graved on top of each one.

It is hoped and expected that they
will be installed here. before Junior
Speaking. Probably these benches
will be of great service to the students
and their visitors of the fairer sex
during the parties which are scheduled
to be held during Junior Speaking.

Shooting Began In
Fourth Corps Area
On Monday Evening

Beginning last Monday the Fourth Corps
Area Gallery Competition began at Davidson
with 15 men composing the Davidson team.
The team is composed of T. G. Purcell
team captain, who led the teat in the try-
outs with a score og 91; W. A. Alexander, |
Julian Lake, G. W. Crawford, C. W. Taylor, |
all of whom tied for second place with scores
of 89 each; A. W. Alexander, C. J. Albright,
R. G. Abernathy, E. E. Brown, J. B. Webb,

J. M. Gudger, K. P. Maddox, G. MeMillan, |

J. Overton, and T, L. Short.

The Fourth Corps Area competition is
held annually, each team shooting on its own
range, and the final scores sent into Fourth
Corps Area headquarters. A cup is the trophy
awarded to the team having the highest score,
and the Wildcatsare trying hard this year to

take the cup away from the present corps ,

area champions, the University of Florida.

Competition for the markmanship trophy is
always keen. Among the colleges competing
are such schools as The Citadel, Clemson,
Louisiana State, Mississippi A. & M., U. of
Florida, Davidson, North Carolina State,
Georgia Tech, Auburn, U. of Georgia, and
other representative schools in this corps
area,

The competition here will be fired by
stages following the schedule shown:

Ist Statge: Feb. 8th to 13th—2
shots, 10 record shots, prone; 2
shots, 10 record shots, sitting.

2nd Stage: Feb. 15th to 20th—(2
shots, 10 record shots, prone; 2
shots, 10 record shots, kneeling,

3rd Stage: Feb, 22nd'to 27th—(2
shots, 10 record shots, prone; 2
shots, 10 record shots, standing.

4th Stage: March Ist to 6th-
shots, 10 record shots, prone;
shots, 10 record shots, prone.

It will be noted that firing takes place on
Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
The range is in the basement of the ayn
nasium and the time of firing is from 2:30
p. m. to 4:30 p. m. Members of the student
body are invited to witness the shoot but are
requested to keep quiet so as not to disturb
the members of the team. Considerable con-
centration is required in order to enable a
marksman toymake his best score, and, when
the nerves are at high tension, the same
ethics apply as.do when a golfer is putting.

Only Five Letter Men Return to
' Form Nucleus for 1926 Team

Track practice for the 1926 season will
begin about the 20th of February, according
to an announcement made by Coach Tex
Tilson last Monday. This will,be rather an

The members of the cross-country squad.
have been practicing all year and participated
in several meets last fall, while all the squad
had a short fall practice for several weeks
after school opened in September. .

With only five letter men back, Coach Til-
son will have a number of positions to be
filled by new material. Several others on
the squad last year, but who failed to make |
their Ietters, are also back. The letter men |
who will be eligible for the team this year
are: Captain Anderson, Williford, Goody-
koontz, Brand and Calhoun. There are also |

;two men from the fresh track team of last

year, these men are Harrison and Penn.
Pinkney, Bohannon, Parker, and Wharton

who failed to make their letter. °

In the four-forty, these men along with
Parker and Pinkney, are the men most fa-|
vored to make a creditable showing. Parker |

eight-eighty. In the mile and in the two-mile
Williford will be back to add another star to
his name. And along with him will be Penn,
who made his monogram on the fresh track |
team last year. In the field events the team
is weaker than in the track events. Calhoun |
is back to enter in the high-jump and he is
the only letter man, except for Anderson, |
in the pole vault, who is back to enter into!
competition this year. In the broad jump, |
' Harrison is expected to make the best show-
ing of the new candidates, since he made his |
monogram on the fresh team last year. In|
the shot-put, there is no letter man, as in the
discus and javelin, In the discus, Bohannon,
who was on the squad last year but failed to
make his letter, should be able to_profit_by |
his last year’s experience and make a letter
this year.

In all, the team seems rather weak from
loss of men, but Coach Tilson will have five |
varsity men around whom he can mold his |
team. There will be a great number of po- |
sitions where new candidates will be able to

' make their letter. |

RULES OF SPORTSMAN-
SHIP

1. Show courtesy to your opponents
—be gentlemen and _ ladies—and
treat opponents as such.

2. Play the game according to the
spirit of the rules—play fair.

3. Abide by the decisions of the offi-
cials without remarks or heckling.

4. Be courageous losers but do not

give up when the score is going
against you. Play your best to the
end—have grit.
Be a modest winner. Do not boast
of victories or “rub it in.” Cheer
your opponents—applaud good plays
of both teams... Take pride in up-
holding the good “Wild Cat Spirit”
of our college. Good sportsmanship
between contestants leads to friend-
ship and not enmity.

But how you played the game.”

Wildcat Matmen to |

Take Long Journey
Through ugh Virginia

The wrestling team left today for a trip |
into Virginia, where they will meet two |
teams. The University of Virginia team
will be met tonight, and the team will go to
V. P. I. tomorrow for a match there. This
will probably be the only trip that the team
will take this year, although another is un- |
der slight consideration, |

Both of these teams are very strong. The |
University of Virginia has not lost a match |
this year, while the V. P. I. team lost to the

margin of three points. Seven men made the
trip with Captain Weems. Four of these, ;
Frierson, Vance, Cox, and Barrington, are
letter men. Cox is captain of the team and
Frierson is the manager.

The men who made the trip were as fol-
lows: Frierson in the 119 pound class; Bar- |

Hansel in the 139 pound class; Cox in the
149 pound class; Bohannon or Crinkley in
the 160 pound class; Vance in the 175 pound |
class, and Mauldin in the unlimited heavy-
weight class. This is practically the same

team that won over Concord in the firs?)

match of the year.

The Freshman team will have a match
with the Winston-Salem High School aggre- |
gation during the latter part of the week. A!
number of freshmen have made strong bids

a good showing. A match with Guilford
College is also being contemplated for this
bunch.

J. S. Foster, H. B. Arbuckle and Caldwell
Withers, are to come from both the fac-
ulty and the students. Dr. W. L. Porter,
class registrar, Prof. K. J. Foreman, A. H.
Hilhouse and R. A, Miller and W. O. Nes-
bit. class president, are to tell the men
f ’28 the whys and wherefores of their
S Leannlinte cents and the things that
lie before them in the remainder of their
college days.

The finance and decorations commit-
tees, working in connection with the pro-
gram committee and Caldwell Withers,
toastmaster, have pushed their part of
the undertaking to a resting stage and

are now waiting for the time for the ban-
|quet to come. The scene of this joyful
jand hilarious occasion is to be at the
| Charlotte Chamber of Commerce.
