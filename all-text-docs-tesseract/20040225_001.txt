VOLUME 95, NUMBER 18

4.9% tuition increase
approved for 2004-05

By ADAM MartTIN
Senior Staff Writer

The Board of Trustees recently ap-
proved the 2004-2005 budget, which,
among other things, calls for a 4.9
percent tuition increase, raising tu-
ition to $27,172 for next fall.

“Overall, the budget funds our
highest priorities,” said President
Bobby Vagt of the new $71.2 million
budget, up from $68.5 million.

“We have moderate increases
across the board - the largest being in
Academic Affairs, no personnel cut-
backs, and we saved significantly due
to energy, mailing and printing effi-
ciency,” Vagt said.

Budgetincreases resulted not from
any significant new programming
but from the summation of many
small increases to the college’s cur-
rent programs.

In addition to inflation, Vagt cited
the rising costs of healthcare as a
major contributor to the rising bud-
get, given that 70 percent of the bud-
get covers compensation and benefits

for all the college’s employees, in-
cluding the administration, faculty
and staff.

“Davidson has achieved medians
for non-faculty staff according to
U.S. News and World Report, but we
are continuing to strive for medians
for faculty,” said Vagt.

Vice President of Academic Af-
fairs and Dean of Faculty Clark Ross
said the five percent increase in Aca-
demic Affairs went mostly to the
general book fund for the library, as
several sources indicate that journal
subscription prices are rising at about
10 percent per year.

Ross admits that the increase in the
library book fund will really only
allow the college to retain subscrip-
tions to the current periodicals that
are needed to maintain academic
quality.

The general fund for faculty sala-
ries did increase slightly.

However, at this point, the “exact
amount that will be rewarded to re-

THE MIGHTY THREE

College Bowl team qualifies for Nationals

By Lourie BECKER
Special Contributor

Last semester’s campus-wide Col-
lege Bowl tournament provided a
memorable diversion for more than
ahundred of Davidson’s trivia fanat-

ics.

But while most of the contestants
have by now moved on from that
annual event and returned to the
Davidson grind, five of them have
remained in the thrall of high-speed
academic competition.

College Bowl team members Austin Mercadante ’06, Rob

Correll ’07. Louis Becker ’04, and Chris Thawley ’04

ponder a question at one of their tournaments.

Although this kind of devotion

might be called unstable, it has —

proven itself to pay off.

After the campus tournament,
College Bowl veteran and planned
giving officer James Gibert ’79 se-
lected ateam of eight all-stars to train
for intercolleigiate competition.

After playing through large piles
of old and new practice questions,
five of the team members, Rob

Correll ’07, Bryant Kirkland ’07,

Austin Mercadante ’06, Chris
Thawley ’04, and Louie Becker ’04,
traveled over the mountains to the
Southeast Regional College Bowl
tournament in Knoxville, Tenn. last
weekend.

Although team members Rob
Neumann ’04, Sean Brooks ’04, and
Erin Meyer ’06 were unable to make
the trip, they nonetheless made in-
valuable contributions to the team’s
preparation. ;

In Knoxville, the team manuvered
through a grueling schedule—a 14-
team round-robin, followed by a
double elimination tournament of the
top four teams.

The competition ran from 8:00

p.m. until midnight Friday, and re-
sumed at 8:30 the next morning.

“With only a break for lunch anda
few bye rounds, the teams played
pretty much around the clock,”
Kirkland said.

Thawley, playing through a cold,
called it “one of the most intensely
mentally taxing periods of the past
semester.”

Through it all, Davidson was aided
by their well-balanced approach,
which allowed one player to rotate
out of each match and avoid burn-
out.

While other teams relied heavily
on the contributions of one or two
players, Davidson’s team forsook
individual glory for the success of the
Whole.

“What distinguishes these guys is
that they work so well together,”
Gibert said. “Their personalities and
skills complement each other unusu-
ally well. Everyone contributes, and
that is why we win so consistently.”

The team may also have been aided
by Mercadante’s predictive abilty;
team members noted jokingly that

Peeping Tom
caught at
Akers Hall

By BLEvIN SHELNUTT
Senior Staff Writer

On Monday evening at about
11:30, a student notified the Campus
Police of a suspicious man lingering
outside of Akers Hall.

After apprehending the man, the
campus police officers recognized
him as an individual with an exten-
sive criminal record concerning
“Peeping Tom” incidents.

“He’s an individual that we were
already familiar with from activity
within the town of Cornelius,” said
Davidson College Director of Pub-
lic Safety and Police Fountain
Walker.

Walker said that he was not aware
the man is residing in Davidson and
believes this to be the first time he
has been on campus.

Walker added that he has notified
the surrounding police departments
of the man’s activity and that Cam-
pus Safety is now on “high alert.”

“ “High alert’ means that if we see
him again on this campus, he goes to
jail,” said Walker.

It was less than a year ago that a
similar incident occured at the same
dorm.

Last March, an intruder entered an
unlocked bedroom in Akers and be-
gan cutting a female student’s paja-
mas open. She awoke during the or-
deal, frightening him away.

Male students pursued him across
campus until Campus Safety was
able to act.

Even though the intruder was later
caught, the event highlighted how
easily intruders could gain access to
many college buildings.

Despite the similarity of these two
incidents, Walker says that there is
nothing particularly unsafe about the
sophomore apartments.

However, he encourages students
to lock their doors at night.

“It’s only a small percentage of
people who come on campus who
have bad intentions, but students still
need to take precautions to protect
themselves from them,” said Walker.
* Echoing Walker’s remarks, Direc-
tor of Residence Leslie Marsicano
sent an email to all students Tuesday
morning, warning them to keep an
eye out for future intruders.
