WEEKLY MEETINGS:

In the Philanthropic Society, Satur-
day night, the question: “Resolved,
That the German peace proposals fur-
nish sufficient grounds to begin peace
negotiations,” was discussed. The
affirmative was upheld by Hamilton,
Campbell, Stone and Webber. The
negative by Currie, Davenport, Mc-
Donald and Fleming. The judges de-
cided in favor of the affirmative; the
house in favor of the negative.

The affirmative contended that Ger-
many’s proposals are fair; that by past
experience she has shown herself almost
unconquerable; and that it will be use-
less to prolong the struggle. The nega-
tive maintained that Germany is not
sincere; that she wishes to shift upon
the Allies the responsibility of a con-
tinued struggle; and that Europe is not
yet in condition to receive peace.

In the Philanthropic Society, Mon-
day morning, the Declamations were:
Siske, ‘‘Narrowness of Spccialties;”
Foreman, ‘Elements of National
Wealth;” Calhoun, “The Election;”
R. D. Hall, “Universal Education.”
The orations were T. N. Morton, on
“College Men in Politics; R. H. Stone,
“The Phi. Society in its Infancy,” in
which he gave some very __ interesting
facts about the beginning of the society.

In the Eumenean Society, Saturday
night, January 13th, the affirmative
side of the debate, upheld by C. B.
Robson, J. R. Woods, Flynn and Eikel,
contended (1) that the proposals made
by Germany are sufficient to open nego-
tiations for peace, tho they may not
seem sufficient to close them; (2) that
Germany is not at the end of her re-
sources; (3) that she is able to main-
tain her ‘present positions indefinitely,
and (4) that if England should win
she would be as bad as Germany as a
dominating power.

The negative, which was upheld by
Thomas, G. M. Robson, J. B. Woods
and Potts, maintained (1) that the pro-
posals are unfair to the Allies because
of the lack of an indemnity for the de-
struction caused by the war having been
fought, and being fought, on their ter-
ritory, and especially in the case of Bel-
gium; (2) that Germany is insincere;
(3) that the people of Germany are
starving, and (4) that there is no clause
providing for the abolishing of mili-
tarism.

On Monday morning, in the Eu-
menean Society, the Declamations were:
“Thanatopsis,” by Brand, and “The
Destiny of America,” by Burgess. L.
K. Boggs gave an oration on the life of
David Lloyd George, Prime Minister
of England.

we were at the beginning of this war in

Speaking on “America and the New
Epoch,” Dr. J. M. McConnell charmed
and held an interested audience on
Tuesday night in the history class room.
This lecture was under the auspices of
the Polity Club, and is one of a number
to be given by prominent speakers in the
near future. In discussing his subject
Dr. McConnell gave an accurate de-
scription of the war conditions in Eu-
rope. which he said affected the United
States. The whole world is in cruci-
ble. It makes everything that has gone
before in history seem as part of an old
regime. America and the new epoch is
considered in four phases: First, in
Finance and Commerce; second, in Pan-
Americanism; third, in Democracy;
fourth, in relation to Internationalism.

times as much as the combined capacity
of the two tanks at present on Cham-

MR. J. P. TAYLOR.

Students of Davidson College were
very grieved to learn of the death of
Mr. J. P. Taylor, a prominent citizer
of Winston-Salem, whose death took
place at his home the night of Decembe:
8, 1916, after a brief illness.

Mr. Taylor was a great friend of thc

ties, and being an ardent admirer of
Davidson.

His death was brought very much
closer owing to the fact that his son, J.
P. Taylor, '20, was a member of the
Student Body, and also that several of
his sons and nephews have been students
of Davidson College during preceding
years,
