THINK THIS OVER.

No one thing does human life
more need than a kind consideration
of men’s faults. Everyone sins;
everyone needs forbearance. Their
own imperfections should teach
men to be merciful. God is merci-
ful because He is perfect. As men
grow toward the Divine, they be-
come gentle, forgiving, compassion-
ate. The absence of a merciful
spirit is evidence of the want of
true holiness. A soul that has really
entered into the life of Christ car-
ries in itself a store of nourishment,
and a cordial for helpless souls
around it. —Beecher.

J. M. WILSON, C. E. OF KY.
STATE WILL HAVE MESSAGE
FROM CHINA.

Fine Meeting In Store for Students
at “Y” Sunday Night.

Mr. Jesse M. Wilson, who will
speaks to the “Y” next Sunday js an
all-round college man. While at
Kentucky State he played both
basketball and football, making his
letter three times in one and twice
in the other. And during his Senior
year was selected captain of the
all-state football team. Besides be-
ing a “good sport” on‘ the athletic
field he was a “good fellow” on the
campus as is shown by his social
and fraternal affiliations and the
.|fact that he was editor of his col-
lege papers.

After graduating with the class
of ’11, in Civil Engineering, he sail-
ed for China to teach in the Hang-
chow Christian College. For the
past seven years he has been the
head of the department of math-
ematics in that college and is now in
America on his first leave.

Although a little off in weight
on account of sickness while on the
mission field his smile is just as
broad and he is just as full of “pep”
as he was in his college days. Those
who know him feel sure that he has
a treat in store for the student body
next Sunday night.

Christian Activities

The jh

MINISTERIAL BAND

The band was called to order by
the president, F. V. Long, and it was
quite a pleasure to hear the excel-
lent address by Dr. Richards. Tak-
ing as his general subject “The
Ministry,” he brought vividly be-
fore the band the great need of
preachers and the wonderful joy
gained by using one’s life so. And
stressing the importance of winning
others to the Gospel ministry he ap-
pealed to each individual present to
be ever on the guard for Christ and
to speak a word for the ministry.
The appeal was so straight to the
individual that each was filled with
an inspiration to do something this
year in this great work.

The address was followed by a
snappy business meeting in which
it was decéided to hold the meet-
ings every other Sunday for forty-
five minutes, from 1:45 to 2:30 p, m./
The meetings are to be conducted
principally by the members of the
band, in order to promote more
ability in speaking for Christ and
for Christianity in general.
