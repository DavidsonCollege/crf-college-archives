Can You Imagine No More Football?

By BRUCE BECKER
Staff Writer

Last night 1 dreamed that the
tresteen abolished all subsidized
athleties a’ Davidson College.

‘Now, before you start cheer-
ing. consider the implications
involved in this move. Cut off
t.om their financial support the
basketball and football players
maAbhed The Hub and the Wild
cat Den with job applications.

Suddenly finding themsefves
with a hundred thousand dol-

lars the administration made
plans to erect a space needle in
the middle of Patterson Court.

Several professors passed out
from stage fright as class at-
tendance levels reached an all-
time high.

Wi:h nothing left to think
about except coeducation there
was a suddcu rise in the inci-
dence of rape on campus.

Coaches Dave Fagg and Ter-
ry Holland sensed the crisis in
the life of Davidson College.
The college needed something

to protest and criticize. But most
of all it needed something it
could refuse to support.

In an unprecedented summit
mecting the basketball and foot-
ball coaching staffs rose to meet
the challenge. They found a so-
lution.

The football team found out
about it in what we supposed to
be our last meeting.

“Now, men,” said Coach Fagg.
“I'm talking about being a
man.”

Huzzahs rose [rom the back
ut the room.

“Coach Holland and I had a
talk. We think we've got a heck
of a thing.”

More huzzahs.

“We've developed what we
call the Wildcat Stud Tourna-
ment. Now what I’m talking
about is getting inside a 6 - foot
circle with another man and be-
ing a winner. The rules are
these: We'll use no athletic
equipment because that costs
money, you can use any blunt
instrument as a weapon, the last
man ative inside the circle is
the winner.

“You men will play some bas-
ke'ball players. It is a single
elimination tournament. The
winner plays Bill Gariett.”

When the news reached the

campus population Davidson
was once again itself, its good

old self. Petitions were passed
in protest. Classes were once

again cut. The rapings stopped.

‘Anxious to know what kind of
a stud | was, | made plans to
enter. | searched the campus
for a suitable weapon.

1 finally found just what I had
in mind. While Mr. Linker was
making vut a patking ticket in
the ROTC parking lo. 1 made
off with his night stick.

The glorious day finally ar-
rived. The event was to take
place on Richardson Field.

I saw C. David Cornell sell-
ing popcoin trying to raise
money for his space needle.
President Samue) R. Spencer
Jr. was smiling proudly as one
of his daughters was elected
Stud Tournament Queeen.

The festivities passed from
my mind as Coach Ernie Tall
gave me a pep talk before my
first match. I was ready.

I had my cowboy hat and my
Linker stick. The adrenalin was
really flowing when | sprinted
out of the tocker room to the
edge of the circle.

When I saw my opponent |
stopped dead in the mud. He
was 6-9, carrying a baseball bat
and had Vandy printed in big
le:ters across his chest. I faint-
ed.

They carried me off the field.
I lost, but I lived.

When | came to they were
having the finals. John Pecorak
was losing to Jimmy Hardison.
Hardison kept poking Pecorak
in the solar plexus with the
cross bar of the south goal
posts.

Big Pig was geting fed up.
In a last ditch | effor. he hit
Hardison over the head with a
t.ee. U was all over except for
the shouting.

In the last match it was the
Pig vs. Big Bad Bill Garrett,
Pig chose a telephone pole to
beat off Garrett. He picked it
up and came after Bill.

Bill wasn’t istimidated. He
walked calmly over to the cor-
nerstone of the gym.

In a Herculean effort he hoist-
ed Johnston Gym onto his shoul-
ders and stumbled after Big
Pig. Pecorak retreated in a hur-
ry. It looked like he was doom-
ed. He was trapped. He could
not escape Bill’s path.

Then, thiity fect from victory
Garrett collapsed and was
crushed by the gymnasium, A
great roar arose from the 60
spectators.

John walked «o the cirele to
claim his laurels. The Tourta-
ment Queen presented him with
a victory kiss, and Cornell gave
him a free ticket of admission
to the space needle.

The Pig wiped a small tear
f.om the corner of his eye. Af-
ter receiving the congratula-
tions of the crowd, he and a
hacd of well wishers retired to
the Cornell Popeorn Emporium
where cvervyone lived happily
ever after.
