What are you getting for your board bill money?

By Jay Jennings

Do you question the value of
your dollar when it comes to pay-
ing your semester meal plan? Who
on campus is getting the best deal
and where? Whether your money
goes toa house on Patterson Court
or to Vail, it is still hard to part
with, especially when you are
doubting the quality or quantity of
food.

All students go through such
doubts, but they do not all have to
pay the same fee. The prices for

women’s eating houses are con-
siderably lower than those for the
fraternities. Because the women’s
houses generally have larger mem-
berships and lower social budgets,
their board bills, as well as social

-fees,-are less than those of men’s.

Those who choose to eat in the
Commons are privy to a wider
variety of meals, as well as pay-
ment plans. Meal plans at Vail
vary from 10 meals to the Quan-
tum Meal Plan, which provides a
certain number of breakfasts and

lunches. These plans range in price
from $564.50 for the senior/off
campus plan to $1,162 for the nine-
teen meal plan.

Only freshmen are denied
choices at the Commons their first
semester. The college forces each
to pay in advance for a 19 meal
plan. This is not always popular,
as Junior Neal Andrews says the
19 meal plan is “a waste because
the full number are rarely used.”

Carlton Pritchard, the Direc-
tor of Auxiliary Services, says that

adequate a workout as the equip-
ment and free-weights in the old
weight room.

Both Rudell-_ and Candelario
feel that a student panel should be
formed to advise the athletic ad-
ministrators of student sentiment.
Candelario would like tosee a pub-
lic forum held regarding the weight
room change.

Candelario plans tosubmit the
petition and signatures to the ath-
letic department early this week.

Athletic Administration’s
Position

The Athletic Department has
been surprised by the show of op-
position to the changes it thought
would be welcomed by students.

The department instituted the
changes in an effort to heed stu-
dent requests for longer Baker

hours and to respond to complaints __

by varsity athletes of overcrowd-
ing in the weight room. The “4-6
rule” was intended to give varsity
athletes priority in the weight room
for two hours a day but was not
enforced.

The administration was. un-
able to solve the problem by sim-
ply extending hours in the old
weight room because of the diffi-
culty they had keeping the room
staffed with trained work-study
students.

Under the new arrangement,
athletic coaches will staff the old
weight room on a rotating basis.
Work-study students will staff the
new room with the work-study stu-
dent manning Baker’s front desk,
adjacent to the new room, serving
as a back-up.

Athletic Director Terry Hol-
land feels that the changes made
create a positive environment for
students but argues that the ath-
letic department cannot accommo-
date each individual’s needs.

Assistant Athletic Director
Bob Price noted that the athletic
department has a strong desire to
serve the student population. He
believes that the expanded hours
and improved equipment will meet
student needs.

In response to complaints
about the absence of free-weights
in the new room, Ron Morrow,
Director of Physical Education,
suggested that students who desire
a free-weight workout use the
Smith machine. Work-study stu-
dents, he said, have been trained in
operation of the new equipment
and will assist students.

The administration is con-
vinced that students can get a good
work-out.on, the new equipment

but has arranged a program through
the football weight room for those
whoare serious about free-weights.
_ The Future

The change is only one week
old and the athletic department has
vowed to monitor usage of the new
facility and to consider expansion
if it is warranted.

However, this pledge does not

address the current status of the
new weight room nor student con-
cerns.

Students should voice their
opinion on this issue, either posi-
tive and negative, by submitting
their comments to the athletic de-
partment in the suggestion box at
the Baker front desk or contacting
Candelario or Rudell.

the reasoning behind the 19 meal
plan is to “start the freshmen off on
the right foot and give them three
Square meals a day and two on the
play days.”

There are several specialized
plans, such as the five meal plan
which is available to seniors living
off-campus. The Quantum Plan
was created this year in order to
allow members of a fraternity or
eating house to have breakfast and
lunch at the Commons, Union, or
Baker and then have dinner at their
house
Junior G.A. McClung thinks
that the Quantum meal is better
than the fourteen meal plan be-
cause “the Union can be used for
meals instead of having to use bo-
nus bucks.”

People eating in either a fra-
ternity or an eating house also have

options in the house from which to
choose. The women’s houses,
however, are more flexible with
their members with many options
to suit varying conflicts.

Full board at a women’s house
includes breakfast, lunch and din-
ner during the week and meals on
the weekend while full board at the
men’s houses consists of only 10
to 15 meals.

Connor House has the least
expensive price of the women’s

_ eating houses with full board at
$720, which includes 19 meals. At
the other end of the spectrum, Sig
Ep has the least expensive price for
the men at $925. This includes ten
meals and no breakfasts.

While on the other side of the
court, the men of Phi Delt pay
