Recent controversy has left
students, faculty, staff, andalumni
questioning the exact role of reli-
gion in our institution. Discus-
sions have led to no precise an-
swers. In publishing this piece,
The Davidsonian is attempting to
present a clear view of the de-
bates coupled with the candid
views of those associated with the
college who have strong feelings
on the issue. As Davidson re-
ceives more and more national
recognition, we are approaching
acrucial point in its development
as one of the few liberal arts col-
leges with Presbyterian affilia-
tion.

Origins of the Debate:
Should Trustees be Christian?

Atthe October 12, 1993 SGA
meeting, former SGA President
Alden Smith expressed concern
over a college bylaw requiring
trustees to be active members of a
Christian church. Since that meet-
ing, currentstudents, faculty, staff,
and trustees have debated about

role of religion at Davidson.

. Many concerns relevant to the

the role of religion at Davidson
— a debate that has never been
resolved.

Discussion centered around

recent SGA debate about the re-
quirement that the president be
Presbyterian. Some argued that
the policy fostered exclusivity;
others argued that the proposed

diversity. They felt that the trust-
ees should represent that diver-
sity already present in the student
body.

Smith emphasized to critics
that elimination of an exclusive
policy would affirm the college’s
Christian heritage.

The trustee debate concluded
atan October 26, 1993 SGA meet-
ing when Smith motioned for the
Senate to approve his resolution,
recommending that the trustee
bylaw be changed.

Two students save lives

Richards, Woodward use Heimlich maneuver

By Russ Tarver

Freshman Emily Richards was
studying on the top floor of the
library with a friend when the un-
thinkable: happened. Her friend
began to choke.

“It’s kind of my fault because
I gave him a box of Junior Mints,”
explains Richards. “He suddenly
pushed himself away from the table
and began stumbling around the
library.”

Initially Richards thought her
friend was joking. “I asked him if
he was serious, and then I thought,
“The Heimlich ... You need the
Heimlich!”

Acting on instinct, Richards
jumped up and began to preform
the maneuver. “I did it four or five
times, and it was dislodged. I
really didn’t have enough time to

think. I just did it.”

Shaken and bewildered after
the incident, both students quietly
sat down and continued working
while 10 or 15 onlookers stood
with mouths gaped in shock.

“Only one person stopped to
ask if he was OK,” says Richards.
“They taught us in PE 101 that if
there are a lot of people around,
one is less likely to act.”

According to Richards the
Heimlich maneuver is “the most
important thing they teach us in
PE. It’s not something you think
you'll ever need but is really good
to know.”

Sophomore Brian Woodward
agrees.

Two weeks ago Woodward
was eating lunch at a local restau-
rant when.a woman nearby began

to cough. “She was coughing
quite a bit and did the universal
sign forchoking,” says Woodward.
“Tasked her ifshe was all right, and
she shook her head.”

After noticing her distress
Woodward got out of his seat and
began using the Heimlich. “She
coughed it right up.”

Woodward says that others
facing a similar situation should
not hesitate. “You don’t have todo
it exactly. right. Just do some-
thing.”

Both Woodward and Richards
are trained lifeguards and already
knew the procedure before coming
to Davidson; however, they felt
the PE 101 refresher course was
beneficial. “I know a lot of people
