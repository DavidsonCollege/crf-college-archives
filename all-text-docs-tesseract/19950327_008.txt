We haven't done enough

“Get that flashlight outa my face” Follow-up article

Every objective story has two
points of view. I wrote an article
last week about the practice of
stopping visitors on campus. The
story was written to express an
African-American student’s per-
spective about the issue. This week
I will focus on the officer’s per-
spective.

Imagine a stranger walking
_ on campus. He is not stopped by
an officer because the officer fears
future allegations. Later on, that
same visitor commits a majorcrime
on campus, which may have been
prevented had the officer inter-
vened. What should he have done?
This is the dilemma campus offic-
ers are faced with.

Officers are expected to do
their jobs, without prejudice, in
order to keep us safe. Yet they are
made to hesitate because of con-
stant questioning. What if they are
tired of responding to articles like
mine? What if they are tired of

answering questions from the Dean
of Student’s Office? Would you
rather they not stop strangers for
fear of future questioning? Or
would you rather they stop too
many people, if that meant keep-
ing you safe? Our society seldom
views police officers as moral
people when race is an issue. This
may be unfortunate.

Concerning the highly publi-

cized incident that occurred a few
weeks ago, the officers had a dif-
ferent view. Their reports show
that the questioning of the Afri-
can-American males occurred af-
ter the disturbance at the Court
party had already been checked.
As the officer drove away, he ap-
proached what appeared to be a
strange car. He could not see in-
side because the windows were
tinted. So he was not harassing a
black male , he was questioning a
strange male. The other vehicles
on the scene were not called for

Hello? Gross!!

A column with some interesting hindsight

The first thing I did as I rolled
out of bed one morning during my
spring break in Destin, Florida,
was to pick out the sports section
from the newspaper that lay out-
side the door of our hotel room. I
then headed for my morning ren-
dezvous with the bathroom.

-Not very long after I perched
myself atop the cold toilet seat I
realized that the sports page wasn’t
going to be of sufficient length for
this particular visit. Warand Peace
would have been a more appropri-
ate choice.

I eventually finished with the
paper. Since I wasn’t in much of a
position to go get something else
to read, I began looking around the
bathroom for something to enter-
tain me. My eyes immediately
transfixed on an object installed
just above the toilet paper rack. It
was a telephone.

A telephone in the bathroom?
I tried to figure out just what pur-
pose this served, but the answer
eluded me. I mean, if there is one
time that I don’t want to be talking
with someone, it’s whenI’mon the
john. It’s just embarrassing: I
mean, what do you say, “let me put
you on hold for a second while I
drop something off and do some
paperwork”?

Our hotel was fairly nice, and
I’m sure they just meant this as a
convenient amenity, probably de-
signed for the busy executive on
the run. Or is that the busy execu-
tive with the runs? I’m not sure
which, but I do know that I person-
ally don’t like doing business while
I’mdoing my business, if you know
what I’m getting at. When I go to
drop a few friends off at the lake, I

have never felt the need to call
someone up and tell them about it.

However, as I mentioned be-
fore, I was extremely bored. I
realized that I could have some fun
with this phone as I passed the
time. So I called up my friends in
the room next to mine and told
them I had something to which
they had to listen. When they
asked what I dangled the receiver
by the cord and lowered it into the
bowl a little ways. I kept it there
long enough for them to hear a
noise that they had probably never
heard ona telephone before. Need-
less to say they were as thoroughly
disgusted as I was amused.

After I called room service
and ordered a four-egg omelet to
be delivered to my bathroom door,
Icontinued with my fun and games.
I called the front desk and asked
them if they knew where I could
perhaps get some ExLax. I then
dangled the receiver down in the
bowl and repeated my trick. I got
back on and told the bewildered
person at the front desk to never
mind, it looked like I wasn’t going
to be needing that ExLax after all.
I was now hooked.

I called up the local Taco Bell
and asked to speak to the manager.
After she got on line I told her that
I was planning on suing her restau-
rant. When she asked why, I gave
her a reason I don’t think she’ll
soon forget.

By this point my omelet had
arrived so I took a little break, and
as I ate I reflected. I sure don’t
know whocame up with the idea of
putting a phone in a bathroom, but
I kinda like it. It lends whole new
meaning to the term “talkin’ crap.”

intimidation. Instead, common
practice dictates that when an of-
ficer is not on a specific call he has
the right to give assistance. And
by theiraccount, many of the offic-
ers either stayed briefly or did not
step out of their vehicles.

Knowing this, should this be
viewed as a possible discrimina-
tory practice? Should we become
more concerned over being stopped
or not being stopped?

The Davidson campus police
force does everything it can to
make our community safe. They
try their best to make minorities
feel welcome as well. I know,
from personal knowledge, they do
their jobs well and without preju-
dice. :

Maybe we should commend
their work ethic rather than attack
their character. Why do we seem
to alienate the very people who try
to make us comfortable? There is
not a good answer.

The perceived notion of dis-
crimination is nothing more than a
symptom; there is a much larger
problem. The real problem lies
with us. We have allowed racism
and discrimination to cloud our
judgment, and we are all respon-
sible. We haven’t done enough to
make this a color-accepting soci-
ety. We haven’t done enough to
ensure that each incident involv-
ing whites and blacks is not turned
into a racial one. We haven’t done
enough to uncloud the judgments
of our families and future genera-
tions. WE HAVEN’T DONE
ENOUGH!

We question every move the
campus police makes. Why? We
have to question motives because
our society has yet to give us an-
other outlet. The motives of the
police have to be questioned as
well as my motives for writing
articles because questioning is nec-
essary.

Collectively, we. haven’t
grown up enough to have any other
practice. Questioning is needed;
attacking is misguided.

While working for Love of
Learning this summer, my. room-
mate, an African-American, was
stopped by campus police. He did
not get upset and was not surprised
at being stopped. Instead, he was
comforted to know that the officer .
was just doing his job. Being
stopped allowed him to feel a lot
safer on this campus.

Being acampus police officer
is tough. If they stop strangers,
their very moral fiber is questioned.
If they don’t, they may be jeopar-
dizing the safety of many people.
We should only ask them to do
their job in a courteous and consci-
entious manner. We should not
attack their motives. Let us all be
reminded that they have created
this extremely safe environmen
that we now inhabit! :

Strange things are afoot

Yes, you might think that the
Davidson/Lake Norman/Cornelius
area is no more than an unassum-
ing mélange of small town tem-
perament and fast food conve-
nience. Oh, but how mistaken you

are! Below this veneer of pacific
normalcy lies a bubbling well of
intrigue and mystery. Yes, it’s
true. Recently, I have observed a
few bizarre and unusual local
puzzles worthy of repeating:

1) Why is there braille on the
drive -through First Union money
machine in Cornelius?

2) Why are there three rows
of faculty/staff parking atthe VAC,
and less than ten spaces for stu-
dents? To my knowledge the yel-
low parking line art contingent in-
cludes only a handful of profes-
sors, Chris Hoveland, and the VAC
janitor. Even if they had two cars
each (including the Jaguar)...

3) Why are there J] places to
get your haircut in the vicinity of
Cornelius and Davidson (I verified
this in the yellow pages), but not
one place to buy pantyhose (be-
sides the illustrious Roses)? Per-
sonally, I only need them for date
functions, but what about the work-
ing female, and perhaps male,
population? I can eat Mexican
food at four different restaurants

with a brand new perm, yet I can’t
get a decent pair of dark nude hose.

4) Why istherea drive through
Coke-machine at the empty gas
station across from Ben and
Jerry’s? Who put it there?

5) Finally, what is all the fat
back on the tables in the rear of
Dover’s for? Shouldn’t it be re-
frigerated? Do people go to
Dover’s to purchase fat, or is it an
impulse item?

Evidently, things are not what
they seem. Perfunctory glances of
tranquil spring days do not reveal
the underbelly of life at Exits 28 &
30. Do all my observations signal
mere coincidence, or perhaps a
pattern of the perverse and bizarre
amongst us? Who knows. The
conundrums continue, so take note.
Strange things are afoot!
