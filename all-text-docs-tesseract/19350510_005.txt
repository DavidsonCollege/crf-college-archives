Room Registration
Cards Due May 10th

R. O. T. C. Uniform Deposit
May Be Tranferable To
Student Registration Fee

Room registration cards were placed
in the rooms Tuesday and must be in
the hands of the Treasurer by May
10th.

As stated in the College Catalogue:
“Assignment of rooms is made by the
Treasurer upon written application.
No room will be reserved for a student
until his registration fee of $10.00 has
been paid, and except in the case of
new men, until he has registered his
selection of courses for the next sem
ester.

If a student wishes to retain the some
room he is occupying for another year,
he must, in addition to paying his reg-
istration fee, notify the Treasurer in
writing on or before May 10, of his
desire to hold this room.

A student of the College who does
not deposit his registration fee by May
10th will be considered as not returning
the next session, and applications for
for entrance after this date will be con-
sidered only in case the number to be
admitted has not been reached.

The registration fee will be credited
as part payment of the fall semester
dues. This fee will be refunded upon
request provided the Registrar or
Treasurer is authoritatively notified be-
fore July Ist that'the student will not
enter. After that date the fee will not
be returned”.

Students with R. O. T. C. deposits
may use this money as a registration
fee; but any shortage, due to lost equip-
ment, must be made up in full with

Others may disappoint. I never do. I’m always
mild, always fine to taste— because I’m made
of fragrant, expensive center leaves, only. Turn
your back on top leaves. They’re raw, bitter,
stinging. Tunn your back on bottom leaves.
They’ re coarse, sandy, grimy. Before I consider
it worthy, every leaf must be a center leaf,
mild, fine-tasting, fragrant. I do not irritate
your throat. Above all —J’m your best friend.
