Many Other Town Itemsof the Week| Change im the Magazine Staff for/A Great Game Anticipated With

Social and Personal.

The following appeared in the Char-
lotte Evening News last week:

“Fhere may yet be another candidate
in the race for the lower house of the
General Assembly from Mecklenburg
county—in the person of Mayor J. Lee
Sloan, of Davidson. Mr. Sloan's many
friends over the county and in Charlotte,
convinced of his eminent fitness for the
place, have been urging him for some
time to become a candidate, and there. is
a likelihood, it is said, that he will yet
see his way clear to accede to the re-
quest. . '
It is pointed out in his favor that he
is not only well equipped for the place,
but that he would make a strong appeal
to those who think the place should be
filled by a business man, who is at the
some time thoroughly conversant -with
public affairs.
friends claim he is. He is owner of a
mill and has other interests at Davidson
and is at the same time familiar with
the needs of rural life and conditions.

Up to date there are only three can-
didates for the lower house, which is en-
titled to three representatives from the
county.”

Next Year.

The literary societies have closed this
year with a good year’s work to the
credit of each. In the declamation contest
both societies entered a large number of
men. In the debate with the University
of South Carolina, both members of the
team were from the Eumenean Society,
and although the decision was unfavor-
able to Davidson, the societies cannot be
anvthing but proud of the way their
team debated. :

This past term the same team over-

whelmingly defeated Wake Forest at
Winston-Salem, adding another to the
list of Davidson’s forensic victories. In
the Fresh-Soph Detate a good deal of
interest and good debating were exhibit-
ed in both societies. The Junior-Seaior
Debate was won by the Philanthropic
Society.
_. The essavists contest in the Philan-
thropic Society has been heard from, !.
H. McEwen winning the medal with an
essav on the industrial education of the
negro. The essayists contest in the Fu-
menean Society has not been decided as
Vet, nor has the fiction contest been
heard from. The Magazine has had a
good vear. The last issue will appear in
a few days. It might be mentioned that
its editor-in-chief is a member of the
Eumeanean Society.

One of the most important things ac-
complished by the Philanthropic Society
this year was a radical revision of its
Constitution.

Much interest is being manifested in
the final game of the season on Thurs-
day. With a clear afternon, there is
sure to be a record-breaking crowd here
to witness this contest. Many alumni
and other base ball enthusiasts from
near-by cities and towns will be present.
There has always been a keen rivalry
between these two institutions in every
department of collegiate work, in_ base
ball, foot ball and debating. ‘Gi’ Guer-
rant’s bunch is coming determined to
take this final game from the “Red and
Blacks.” Coach Cook is also deter-
mined, and more so, to land this game.
and is getting the Varsity in the best of
condition for this last game.

The Game-cocks have a fast fielding
and a good hitting team. So. far this
season has been a successful one for
them. Their line-up is as follows:
Plaxico, cf; Langston, rf: Shuler, 3b;
W. Rudisill, ss; Edens, tb; Richards,
lf; F. Rudisill, 2b; Stoney and Hey-
wood, c; Mills and Adams, p. Along
with the team also travels the “State”
reporter, Mr. Sam Latimer. Last week
thev defeated Wake Forest on the Bap-
tist home ground by the score of 5 to 0.
At V..P. f their string of victories was
broken when they lost to che Tecks 9 to
6. Again on Saturday they were defeat-
ed by V. M. 1. 12 t0 6. They plav sev-
eral games the first of this week and
have the last game of the trip on Sprunt
‘Athletic Field.

The line-up for this game will be
about the same as usual. Captain Crav-
ton, who has been out of the last two
games with a sprained ankle, will be
back with his usual “pep.” Elliote will
hardly be able to play anv more this sea-
son on account of his finger, but Keesler

W.ANhas been showing up well behind the

plate. The “Electric Machine” will be
full of pep and will give the Game-
Cocks a hard fight.
