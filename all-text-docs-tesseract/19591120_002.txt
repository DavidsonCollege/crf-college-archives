THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1959

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

Dogwood, Driftwood,
-~or DEADWOOD?

The Student Council’s abortive at-
tempt last Monday night to kick off
its series on campus issues turned out
to be a failure.

There is a long story behind this
first forum; it would be interesting
to examine each step along the way
of careful planning.

The first inkling of such a series
came one chapel period when Presi-
dent Green announced the new idea
and the date of the first forum. The
DAVIDSONIAN published one article
concerning the Council’s attempt at
justification of existence; we ‘vere
not contacted for further advertise-
ment. We saw no signs promoting the
meeting, and casual conversation
barely mentioned it.

The day of the first- meeting ar-
rived. The Council discovered that
this night was the first of the IFC
wrestling tournament, planned and
publicized for some. time. It also
found that there was a meeting in-

volving some thirty ROTC cadets for

half ar hour in the evening. Perhaps
it finally noticed that no reservation
for the Union ballroom had been
made. no coffee planned.

The Council wisely decided to

postpone the forum, but apparently
no word of the postponement was of-
ficially circulated. We, at least, heard
none. However, a few stalwart facul-
ty members stood in the lobby, wait-
ing for action to begin. It was for
the desk man on duty at the time to
tell them that the forum had been
postponed.

The postponed meeting was sched-
uled for eight o’clock Thursday eve-
ning. Nothing at this time could pos-
sibly interfere with the forum, ex-
cept possibly the fact eighty-five
percent of the students would be in
fraternity meetings that night. How-
ever, with a chapel anouncement and
a few scattered signs, the Council
charged on, determined to make the
forum a success.

We've never seen such a miracle
of disorganization. Looks like the big
men on campus have really pulled
off a fiasco.

Luckily the issue was popular
enough to draw a respectable crowd
last night. With a little preparation
and promotion, it could ‘possibly have
been a capacity one.

We wish the Council luck on its
coming forums. Who knows, we may
see some blossoms yet.

Invitation For Inside Job

From time to time we come across
statements and editorials demanding
the admission of Red China to the
United Nations.

Those who advocate this follow
the mentality of the ostrich who has
hidden his head, in the sands of il-
lusion and has not learned the bitter
lesson of past appeasement of tyranny
and does not see the potentially
dangerous results of such a policy
to our national security.

Today the Red leaders are nearer

than ever to their goal—control of
Formosa and other strategic areas as
steps in the conquest of Asia. Daily
we read of their encroachnients on
Laos and India.

To really achieve their goal of
Asian conquest communist leaders
know that they must be given a place
in the UN to build their prestige in
Asia and .to frustrate permanently the
UN's ability to rally the public opin-
ion of the free world to preserve
peace.

So far the United States and a

majority of the other nations of the
free world have refused to be inti-
midated by Red Chinese threats or
bluster. The overwhelming majority
of American people are firm in their
support of our government’s policy
of refusing to appease Mao tse-Tung
and ‘his henchmen at the expense of
our allies.

Some still see fit to travel the
road of appeasement and accommo-
dation with an avowed enemy of our
country and of universal freedom.

They advocate we elevate Red
China to a position of our own in the
eyes of the world. They advocate this
despite repeated declarations by two
Presidents against the admission of
Communist China to the UN; despite
unanimous resolutions by both Hous-

almost identical planks in both par-
ties’ platforms in the last Presidential
election to the same effect.

In the face of new communist
moves against the United: Nations it-
self some would invite the Reds in—
for an inside job.

Another One Of Many...

All this mumbling about the cut
system might be rather pointless if
all we did were to deal in generali-
ties. We don’t think we have done this
but lest we-be guilty of such a_sin,
let us point to another specific fault
in the rules.

Dave Warden, in his letter to the
editor on this page, has isolated such
a fallacy. The rule reads as follows:

tf a student incurs two unexcused
absences: permitted in a course or in
any required college assembly (chapel
or vespers) he may not take trips in-
volving absences in the area in which
the excess absences are taken.

The columns of this paper have
railed at this before. Basketballer
Bill Shinn had to fly back to school
from Bristol, Tennessee during the
past basketball season to attend a
class in compliance with this rule.
This trip cost the college about a hun-
dred dollars.

At that time we protested the
senselessness of a rule that compelled
such an action. Time has presented
no new evidence that would change
our opinion.

We can also remember the time
when a Phi Beta Kappa could not
make an athletic trip because of this
very same ruling.

This rule limits not only athletes,
but also all students on other school-
Sponsored trips such as conventions,
choral trips or what-have-you. Soon-
er or later it affects quite a large
number of people.

We feel that this specific rule is
just another example of a system that
offers little real benefit to the col-
lege. As shown, some of its ramifica-
tions are rather ridiculous.

That is, unless some one particu-
larily happens to like airplane rides.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Warden Tackles Cut Problem:
Ray Calls Vespers “Dangerous’’

Dave Warde

Dear Editor: .

_My pet peeve (besides whist-

ling) is the following:
“Davidson College Regula-
tion for Students,” p. 43.
Participation in Athletics.
“lf a student incurs two
unexcused absences in addi-
tion to the number of unex-
cused absences permitted in
@ course or in any required
college assembly (chapel or
vespers) he may not take
trips involving absences in
the area in which the excess
absences are taken.”

Why can’t the “college or-
ganizational participant” have
class cuts without -for-
feiting his right to take trips?
Does the college administration
wish to discourage any or all

his 25%

organizational participation?

t don’t believe the college
administration realizes the
number of athletes who would
like fo participate in varsity
sports but do not, solely be-
cause of this ruling.

There are not many students
who cut class just for the sake
of cutting. Sometimes cutting
a class can help a student in
his overall college work. Some
cut class to go home early at
Christmas to work. These cuts
are unexcused and will count

against the athlete.

Therefore the swimmers,
the besketbell players, wrest-
lers, and indoor track men
should not apply for an early
Christmas job. They don’t
have the cuts. There are
many valid reasons (besides
this one) for cutting.

It is my hope that by realiz-
ing the benefits of cutting a
class the Administration and

the student body can see the
unfairness and unnecessity of
such a ruling as this.

Dear Editor:

Perhaps there’s more to this
problem of Vespers than mects
the eye. We hear over and over
the statement, “If you object
to Vespers, why did ‘you come
to Davidson?” But those who
say this do not realize that col-
lege is a time for a re-evalua-
tion of oneself and one’s ideas
in light. of new knowledge and
of new steps taken on the road
to maturity.

This sort of re-evaluation
requires a degree of objectivi-
ty, both in examining oneself
and in looking at the world
of belief and opinion. Ob-
jectivity requires freedom
from tension. Many a student
has decided what morals he
will have .in college before
coming, but placed in the
tension of the desire to be
a good guy, he loses objectivi-
ty and goes along with the
crowd, violating many inhibi-
tions and ideals that he had
in high school.

But in tae area of concern
which deals with the meaning
of life and of the universe, a
reasonable attitude would be to

Big Strike Ouery
Who'll Run US.A?

By JOHN STONE

A Taft-Hartly injunction has
ended the nation-wide steel
strike temporarily. The big is-
sues have not been settled,
however, and it appears that as
soon as the eighty days of the
injunction run out, the strike
will resume. ‘

As I see it, the big question
is this: Who is going to con- .
trol the industrial destiny of
the United States. Perhaps
this may seem to be some-
thing of an overstatemont of
the importance of the present
strike, but tabor has been
growing in strength for many
years, and if this is not the
final test, it is certainly a big
one.

Steel is one of the most vital
factors in the national econ-
omy, and the control of this in-
dustry is the key to ultimate
control of the economy. Labor
is aware of this, and is appar-
ently willing to go to great
lengths to gain a victory here.

Yet there is more. If labor
wins, the inflationary spiral
will continue, for the wage
demands are quite high, and
the price of steel must rise
to offset them. The labor

unions need to realize that
they cannot have their cake
and eat it too, short of so-
clalism, which is not really
a solution to the problem,
but the bringing on of more
troubles than we face at pres-
ent.

On the other hand, if Man-
agement wins, the unions will
lose much strength, perhaps too
much, and no one can deny
that the unions have  ac-
complished much for the wel-
fare of the workingman. In the
long run, this would not be
good for America either.

The solution to the steol
strike, then, is not to be
found in dollars and cents,
but in a change in basic at-
titude. Both labor and man-
agement need to realize that
they must, in an industry so
vital, work togethor. The rest
_of us suffer from the strike:
the, whole country is the
loser.

In the meantime, the wea-
pons of industrial warfare are
silent. But unless a basic re-
sponsibility is recognized, they-.
will resume firing soon. And
we can only sit and watch.

A Wry Parable Of Gods,
The Good And The Bad

By JACK

TAYLOR

The good God and the bad God, in their wanderings
to and fro over the earth, once met on a hill overlook-
ing a cluster of stately Neo-Classic buildings firmly

rooted in the Bible Belt.

“A despicable place,” said the good God disdainful-

ly.

“An admirable place,” said the bad God approving-

ly.

“They confuse me with you; they have made evil

things good, and good things evil,” moaned the good

God.

“Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished,” re-

plied the bad God jovially.

“They have a fine way of rejecting my command-
ments, in order to keep the traditions of men. Their
golden rule is Expediency,” thundered the good God.

» “They listen well to my teachings,” observed the

bad God.

“They make golden idols of my words, but pay no
heed to their meaning. They mold my teachings to fit

| their desires. And when they pray, they congratulate

me for being on their side, and thank me for making

them better than others.”

“Wonderfully unrighteous people!” exclaimed the

bad God.

“They are anxious about what they shall wear, and
what they shall eat, and what they shall drink. They
teach success, not Life. They believe that the highest
good in life is $25,000 a year and perfect Sunday School
attendance,” muttered the good God.

“May their tribe increase,” chortled the bad God.

“They anesthesize the
rituals. They maim the spirit

soul with their dogma and
of life with their regulations

and restrictions. They drive men from me with their
hollow chants,” cried the good God.
“A delightfully dead place,” agreed the bad God.
“They practice their piety before others, that it will

be known. They are forever
groaned the good God.

boasting of their goodness,”

“A characteristic trait,” replied the bad God, vain-

ly stroking his lean flanks.

“And they have such good potential,” Sighed: the

good God.

“May they never realize it,” prayed the bad God.
And so saying he saluted the good God. The good God
nodded acknowledgement, and the two parted to con-
tinue their search over the face of the earth.

to mental health that results
from too rigid a set- of moral
values and then sing hymns in
Vespers which go so far, for
example, as stating the necessi-
ty of subduing the flesh and
est attempts to get at the
all its lustful ways. Does it real-
ly make no difference?

Finally, § would like to quote
from “The Academic Qualities
of a Religious College,” aon ar-
ticle by a Presbyterian, Harold
P. Simpson, in the May issue
of Faculty Forum:

“I find it difficult to re-
duce education to dogma. If
the fundamental aim of a col-
lege is to pursue truth, no
matter where it leads, then a
college must remain hospite-
ble to all points of view in-
sofer os they represent hon-

truth.

“Spokesmen for some religi-
ous faith are convinced they
have found truth, evasive
though it is. Their duty is then
clear; they must fight heresy
and error, But education. unin-
timidated education, is far re-
moved from such dogmatism.
Religious insights, or any other
kind of insight, cannot be im-
posed by decree upon the stu-
dent.

“Each student must finally
face the awful freedom to think
for himself. In my mind, a so-
called religious college most
strikingly reveals its religious
spirit when education is con-
ducted in a free spirit, without
the “benefit” of sacred or secu-
lar decrees.”
