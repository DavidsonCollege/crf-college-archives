Smith’s Status At UNM

On Hold Until Trial Ends
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (CPS)
-- William Kennedy Smith will
have to wait until his Florida rape
trial is over to find out the status
of his medical residency at the
University of New Mexico.

University Hospital spokes-
person Carolyn Tinker said the
medical center approved Smith’s
residency application in August,
and he theoretically could begin
the program at the trial’s end.
Smith was a graduate of Geor-
getown University Medical
School.

“We will have to weigh the
outcome, talk with him, see what
the situation is, if he is able to
come or if he still wishes to,”
Tinker said. “There will be a
whole series of discussions after
the trial when we know what
circumstances to deal with.”

The 31-year-old nephew of
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-
Mass., is currently on trial for the
rape ofa 29-year-old Jupiter, Fla.,
woman, who says Smith attacked
heron the Kennedy family estate
in Palm Beach on March 30.

Smith has pleaded innocent
to the charges.

Fright Night Prediction
Doesn’t Come True
(CPS) -- Students at colleges in
the Northeast got more than the
traditional Halloween scare this
year because of a rumor predict-
ing amass murder on one of their
campuses.

Most breathed a bit easier
when the first of November

dawned and brought the death of
the false prediction.

Students at Syracuse Univer-
sity, Franklin Pierce College, the
University of Massachusetts, Holy
Cross, Boston College and Har-
vard all had heard the story -- that
a psychic on the “Oprah Winfrey
Show” predicted the Halloween
massacre On a campus with an L-
or T-shaped building overlooking
a lake or cemetery.

According to the rumor, 16th-
century astrologer Nostradamus
originally predicted the killings.

Aspokesman for “Oprah” says
no psychic made an appearance on
the show and made the prediction.
She added that dozens of people
had called about it.

Days before Halloween, the
Harvard Crimson rana story about
therumor, quoting several students
who said they were a little anxious,
but not really worried.

especially black women, in a de-
humanized fashion. Images im-
plied that black women were less
attractive than their white counter-
parts, often subtly ridiculing stere-
otypical black physical traits. The
“black mammy” images of the
black subservient to the white
household sharply contrasted to
those of the “glamorous” white:

women of magazine covers.
Verner argued that these-im-
ages were responsible for present
racial and gendér misconceptions.
Although modified today, these
same perceptions affect modern
ideas of success and romance.
She criticized the media’s
manipulation of Clarence Tho-
mas’s senate confirmation hear-
ings, saying they have “brought to
mind how much media influences
us.” Claiming that the image was
more important to the media than
the truth, she said, “we are con-

stantly being emotionally and
psychologically jerked around...
we’re only free to think about what
they tell us to think about,”

A student at Cornell in the
1960s, Verner has also been a
social activist involved in racism
on campus. She has done work-
shops around the country, helping
to combat the problem. A cam-
paigner for academic diversity in
higher education, she said,” people
take it for granted that there are
black studies and gender studies
on campus.”

despair’ that she witnessed in the
world,

According to Parker, the “signs
of despair” are “numerous and
alarming”. “We’ve only studied
1% of all species intensely, we
aren’t.sure what has been lost or
even what may be lost,” Parker
said. “Annually, we loseanamount
of Third World rainforest the size
of the state of Pennsylvania.”

However, Parker noted that
“while it may only be local, there
are some substantive indicators of
what can be done, some signs of
hope do exist.” Parker cited re-
forestry in Jamaica, forest man-
agement in Nepal and forestry
education in Costa Ricaas signs of
environmental “hope”.

Parker felt that there has been
a definite change in attitude, “a
changing of positive behaviors”

among people of the world con-
cerning the environment. She
mentioned a 1988 United Nations
survey that revealed that 97% of
those Latin Americans surveyed
felt that the environment was a
“major” concer, illustrative of
changing attitudes.

In order to attack areas of
environmental concern, Parker
stressed that we have to deal “not
only with the symptoms of the

problems butalso the causes.” She

referred to the fact that replanting
trees in the rainforest does not at-
tack the “deeper problem” of a
growing population in that region.

Parker also addressed the role
of women in these developing
nations and their impact on the en-
vironmental practices. Presently,
Parker is working with ‘two
Davidson graduates, Mary
Mulhern ’86 and Suzanne Mauze
*89. on a study of gender issues in
Latin America for a group called
GENESYS.

Parker discussed the world’s
misconceptions of womenas “only
reproducers or nurturers” when in
actuality women are the “resource
planners” of many communities.
Women have a great impact “on
species diversity by their planning
of crops and role as food provid-
ers” Parker said she was most
concerned with removing» the
“myopia of the way the world re-
ally works, you have to talk about
women, it is an economic, envi-
ronmental imperative.”

Parker concluded her lecture
by stating that “only through
commitment and action as. indi-
viduals can we make contributions
toa society where signs of despair
outweigh those of hope.” She said
that she has become “more opti-
mistic” as she adjusted her expec-
tations for change. “I do see a lot
of change, people are becoming
aware of the issues and what they
have in their own environment.”
