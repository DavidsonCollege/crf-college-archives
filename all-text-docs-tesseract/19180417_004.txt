CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR 1S
LED BY D. M. ORGAIN

The Christian Endeavor Society mect-
ing was led last Sunday night by D. M.
Orgain, on the subject, “How We May
Enjoy the Sabbath.” Ogain gave a short
talk, first tracing the history of the Sab-
bath, showing that “Sabbath” means
“cessation"—a_ rest from the labors of
the week ; then showing that we may en-
joy the Sabbath by being active for
Christ on that day: Discussion by mem-
bers of the society brought out other
thoughts on this subject. Not as many
were in attendance as is usual, probably
owing to the change in time, but it is
hoped that the attendance will improve
in the near future.

It was announced that Norman John-
son, 15, would address the joint mecting
on April 28.

The mother of G. W. Brown was on
the Hill visiting him for a short while
last week.

M. C. A. Conference at Blue Ridge.

Sergeants Colburn and Forbes, of the
Allied Armies, were visitors on the Fill
recently. Both these men have been in
the trenches and are now stationed at
Camp Greene, training our boys in
trench warfare. ‘They were accompa-
nied by Corporal Inglebrett, also of
Camp Greene. ‘Vhese soldiers were all
pleased with the drilling of the David-
son Battalion and passed many compli-
ments upon it.

A LIBERTY BOND.

“What good will a $50 bond do the
government?” is asked.

The government reports its own an-
swer to that. question.

A $50 bond will buy 14 rifle gren
ades.

Ie wall buy 23 hand grenades

It will provide trench knives for a
rifle company.

It will furnish 160 first aid packages
to dress wounds,

It will buy 10 cases of surgical instru-
ments for officers’ belts.

It will buy 27 cases of surgical in-
struments for enlisted men’s belts.

And a $100 bond will buy five rifles.

It will clothe a soldier.

It will provide 30 rifle grenades.

Te will buy 45 hand grenades.

It will buy 2,000 surgical needles.

It.will feed a soldier for cight months.

Do you think it's worth while to buy
a little bond? If you do you may be
interested to know that a $500 bond
will supply bicycles for the headquarters
of an infantry regiment.

A $1,000 bond will buy an X-ray ap-
paratus outfit or the pistols for a_ rifle
company. .

And a $1,500 bond will buy an auto-
mobile ambulance.

A $5,000 bond Will buy a Liberty
truck, or seven Lewis machine guns.

And a $10,000 bond will equip three
field hospitals containing 50 beds each.

And a $50,000 bond will maintain a
submarine for more than a year.

These are a few things the bonds,
large and small, will buy. So that when
the solicitors approach you for a sub-
scription you may know something of
the value.

Mrs. Arbuckle entertained on Mon-
day night in honor of Miss Fithian and
Miss Woolsey. A delightful “advertis-
ing game" was played; to the enjoyment

of all. Those attending were Misses
Fithian, Woolsey, Miley, Frances

Worth, and Messrs. Richardson, Aiken.
Grey and Captain Lea.

SUMMER WORK
FOR STUDENTS

For those who want to work next
summer, there may be an opening in a
navy yard. Col. ‘I’. £.. Bland states that
it is possible for Davidson men to go to
come navy yard in a group. He has
written to the Washington authorities
about the matter, and will let the stu-
dents know what has been decided as
scon as he hears.

Concord Presbytery convenes ‘Tues-
day night, and Mr. W. ‘T. Thompson
was appointed delegate, with Dr. H. B.
Arbuckle as alternate.” Mr. Thompson
will be unable to go, so Dr. Arbuckle
expects to leave Wednesday morning in
his stead. Dr. Arbuckle will be able to
attend only two days of the session.

INTERESTING
CORRESPONDENCE

Qut of an annual correspondence of
more than 50.000 letters, reports and
other pieces of mail matter received by
the State Board of Health, there fre-
quently come some interesting and un-
usual letters. For instance, in reply to
the inquiry as to the cause of a death
which information was needed to com-
plete a death certificate, the advice given
was, “Don't know. Died without the
aid of a doctor,”

A few days ago, in the same mail
came a letter from India complimenting
the Health Bulletin, and asking for oth-
er. popular health literature, an inquiry
in regard to whether the hard winter
had injured the Chinaberry crop and if
they made a good medicine, and the fol-
lowing parody on Mary Had a Little
Lamb:

“Mary had a cold one day.
It started in her head:

And everywhere that Mary went
That cold was sure to spread.

“It went with her to school one day,
It seldom is the rule

For happy children, bright and gay
‘To fear a cold at school.

“So the teacher came up close
‘Pook Mary on her knees

Right then and there she got her dose,
And soon began to sneeze.

“So hock and sneeze became the rule
In that fair country side,

The doctor made his many tens,
And new born babies died.

“Never, never, blame the Lord:
But learn this simple rule,

To keep your ‘bad colds’ to yourself
And cease to act the ‘fool.’ ”
