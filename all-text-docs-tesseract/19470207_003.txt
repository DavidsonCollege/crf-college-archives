Monday night found the Wildcats locking
horns with S. Carolina again after taking wins
from Charleston 67-53, and The Citadel 60-34.
A win from the Gamecocks will mean a tie at

sixth place with N. Carolina, while a loss would
shove the Davdsonians back to the eighth slot. As
the sports sheet goes to press the results of the
S. Carolina tilt is not yet released, but your scribe
is predicting a 52-50 Win for Old D.C. _
The big question mark now is hovering over the Duke
and Carolina engagements over at Duke and Chapel Hill

Friday and Saturday.

If the Wildcats

can show the kind

of ball against N. Carolina Saturday that put the Game-
cocks.to shame in Charlotte last week, Davidson's con-

ference and tourney hopes will be riding high. But Duke

the night before may present a tougher problem.

The

Duke team is big and fast moving, paced by Koffenberger,
and will be out to repeat their performance of a few weeks

back, when they took the

Coach Story ever with the football eye has had his men
back on the grid for the past few days and it looks like
spring practice is in the offing. With the loss of only a few
men, Story will enter next years season with practically an
unaltered squad. Some of the B team stalwarts are now

working out with varsity, and will see

action next year.

WRESTLING
The Davidson Grapplers meet Appalachian

Saturday, and if improvement is proportional

should wrack up their first win of the season.
Opening sluggishly the mat-men dropped a 36-0
match with V.M.I., went on to three successive
losses to Carolina, Duke, and Ga. Tech, but results
in the Tech Match were encouraging. Stroup
pinned Thornbrough in the 121 class, Rufus Long,
135 took his tangle, and Alexander out-fought his

opponent to a decision. O’Hare also come through

with a pin. Alexander shows promise and ability

though new to the wrestling game, and with a

little experience will probably become one of
the Cats leading mat gladiators.

squad is beginning to take on some

of the polish of an experienced
basketball team.

Composed mostly of freshmen,
the team started off slow, showing
a marked need of experience. How-

the eagle eye of Mentor Means

who has begun to bring order out
of the early season chaos.

Losing their first game to Bre-
vard and the third to Lees-McRae,
the kittens have trounced on Mars

Hill, Presbyterian Junior College
twice, Pfeiffer, and Oak Ridge. In
the Pfeiffer game, they scored
74 points to their opponents 54
which is fast and accurate shooting
in any man’s ball game. In the
second P.J.C. game, the kittens

came out on top with a 60-29 tally
