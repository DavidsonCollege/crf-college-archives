Active Recruiting Raises Acceptance Levels

profile is attributable to several
sources. Davidson’s offering of an
increased number of Merit Schol-
arships, such as the Cornwell
Scholarship, attracted several ap-
plicants.

Additionally, the travels of
Eleanor Payne of the Admissions
staff, who “literally went around
the world,” introducing people to
Davidson also resulted in an in-
creased quality of applicants and
acceptances.

Another major factor in bring-
ing quality students to Davidson is
its Division I athletic status, Hogg
says. A prime example of the
influence of athletics is the na-
tional recognition received by
Davidson’s soccer team this year,

Hogg says about students from
other regions of the country, “If
they know nothing else about
Davidson, they know our soccer
team.”

Finally, Hogg cites increased
recruiting help from Davidson’s
faculty this year. Several faculty
members traveled with members
of the Admissions staff, present-
ing information about Davidson at
high schools throughout the coun-
try, while others made personal
phone calls to interested students.

Although all of the acceptance
letters have been sent, Hogg insists
that the work of the Admissions
staff is far from finished. For the
first time ever, a rigorous timeline
of efforts aimed at recruiting the

-best class possible has been estab-

lished, and began the day that the

letters were mailed.

These efforts include giving
accepted students an “enormous
personal contact” with Davidson

students, alumni, faculty, parents

of current students, and Admis-
sions officers. A faculty phonathon
was held last Wednesday, night,

where high-caliber students were —

contacted by professors from the
departments in which they had
expressed an interest.The push to
yield high-quality students culmi-
nated on Saturday in Decision
Davidson Day.

214 of the accepted students,
or 25% of the entire group, at-
tended this opportunity to explore
life at Davidson. Some of these
students. arrived early to attend an
Honors Scholars Banquet on Fri-
day.

Panel Aims to Increase Tolerance of Gays

elists described feelings that dif-
fered from the majority of their
peers’ as early as kindergarten or
elementary school. But they did
not verbally express their feelings
before late high school for the most
part.

‘One of the professional

women described her conservative .

background with a Jewish father
and Catholic mother. She attended
anall girls Catholic boarding school
where she confided in a Catholic
priest who encouraged her to fol-
low her inner feelings.

The support from an authority
figure helped lead to her accep-
tance of her orientation. She says
she, “came out in a big way and I
haven’t stopped talking!”

Every panelist expressed the

early difficulties accepting being
gay or lesbian. ~
One woman said she had a

. “horrible time being lesbian and

fought it very hard.” Eventually
though each person seemed to re-
alize the value of honesty and in-
tegrity as they became confident
about who they are. The same
woman said she finally “learned
diversity was exhilarating.”
Davidson students described
the difficulties; the student who
transferred said that, “after
Davidson, I can deal with any-
thing,” but that the experience
helped him “grow a lot more.” He

, told about repeated- incidences in ,

the Commons when peers threw
food athim and about actual verbal
threats.

On an individual basis, the
senior panelist appreciated ‘her

friends never-ending support at
Davidson. Sharing with her friends
“created a whole new level of trust
and honesty realizing who you are
and what your feelings are.”

She did, though, experience
negative reactions from a friend
from home similar to those experi-
ences of the other panelists.

One audience member asked
how friends and family members

should approach someone who
might be gay or lesbian. The panel
disagreed about the appropriate
response.

They agreed concemed friends
should,”make ‘it clear you are.
openminded.” One panelist sug-
gested that asking openly and hon-
estly if a friend or relative is gay or
lesbian reveals so much comfort
with the situation that there is no
need to be secretive.

Moore Says Actions Were Not Racially Biased

stopped them. “There are times

that for some reason a person just
doesn’t look right and you feel like
you have to check things out. Some
people you can tell are not stu-

dents. They [the officers] have to
use their judgement,” said Moore.

_ According to Moore, he is
confident that this was not a racist
incident. “I wouldn’t hire anyone
who I think would go out and ha-
rass students because of their race

or sex,” he explained, “I’m abso-
lutely confident that our officers
are not racist.”

Moore further explained that
if the officers were afraid to check
the identification of suspicious
persons on campus they would not
be doing their job in protecting the
students. “They wouldn’t be of
any good to anybody if they were
afraid to do their job.”

However, Leak and West want
to know why they look suspicious.
According to West, it is not just
them but other blacks male stu-
dents have been stopped by police
on campus. “I’ve never heard it
happen to a white guy; I think the
bottom line is that we’re black
guys,” said West.

Leak stated, “The police get
suspicious when they see a black
face.”

West does not think the police
are trying to harass him, but he
feels that the actions taken were a
result of biased judgement.

West thinks that this is an ex-
ample of the underlying racism on
this campus. He said, “If you look
at the cifcumstances, what other
reason do they have?”

“Tt’s an example of the stereo-
type that many people have about
black people: that we steal, fight,
and commit any type of street
crime,” said Leak. He continued,
“It’s aboutracism and prejudices.”
