“The
Cracker
Box,” The
Davidsonian's
joke column of October
17, 1929, demonstrated the
open-mindedness and
humility of Davidson men
regarding women: “A man
finds his ideal woman in one
who possesses virtue, beauty,
amiability, loyalty, affection,
domesticity, comradeship and
patience.

“A woman finds her ideal
man in one who possesses
mazuma, kale, cash, coin,
currency, chink, and money.”

The November 26, 1925,
issue of the paper illustrated
the worldliness and sophisti-

Who were
the women
of the twenties?

They voted, smoked, bobbed their hair
and wore short skirts

The twenties are often
viewed as the first time
women began to be recog-
nized. For example, they got
the right to vote in 1920 and
rebelled against traditional
stereotypes by cutting their
hair and shortening their
skirts. In the April 26, 1923,
issue of The Davidsonian, the
paper gave a review of a play
that tried to predict the end
result of women’s suffrage.
Mr. and Mrs. Polly Tick was a
musical comedy in which the
supposed roles of men and
women were reversed. “Man
was the housekeeper and

ironic, describing the play as a
“musical comedy farce.” The
play continued about the
“hen-pecked husbands” and
their determination to get the
right to vote. In the end, the
clash was dissolved according
to popular opinion of the day.
The woman, when forced to
choose between her man and
her politics, chose her man:
“The pair decided to enter the
bonds of matrimony on the
old fashioned basis.” Al-
though only a simple review,
it reveals something about the
feelings of men during that
time. One can only wonder
