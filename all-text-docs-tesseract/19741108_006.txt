However, Pomeroy’s
athletic pursuits won’t end

when he hangs up his helmet'

at the end of the football
season. He was a star per-

leading the team in three

categories including batting ,

average while driving in 27

runs. His five home runs :

were a team record.

Foley, the game was -

‘times behind Wildcat lines for
‘a sum of 55 yards in losses,
bringing Harper a total of -5
yards in offense.

When asked about the ten-
dency of the offensive line to
allow Harper to be sacked so
frequently, Farrell asserted,
“Part of the problem is pass
blocking. The more emotional
you are, the more likely you
are to pass block. We were
behind in many plays, and the
other team: was assured of a
passing situation and put on a
big rush.”

Guilford gained 324 yards to
Davidson’s 209 offense. Har-
per completed 8 out of 13
passes for 75 yards. Whitley
completed 13 out of 20 at-
tempts for 146 yards passing.

Guilford is considered one of ,

the most improved teams in
the country. Last year they
broke a 30 game losing streak
to go 1-9 for the season. After

eating Davidson Saturday,
the Quakers are now 6-2-1 for
the season. Davidson is now 1-
5 for the year.

In a post-game interview,

Farrell had much to say con-

of the reason for

a lack of Wildcat football suc-
cess.

“In this loss on Saturday we
lost to someone we were
capable of beating.’*

“We weren’t keyed up. It’s
all up to us, the coaches, to get
them there. We. went into the
game very flat.

“Our team is disappointed
after a loss and they are not
very happy. I suspect that the
feeling does not last long
en . We tend to forget
those defeats.”

Concerning execution of
play, Farrell said, ‘There
were a lot of problems. There
was a breakdown in defensive
coverage.

“But, these things are very
trivial. By being aggressive,
you can make up for it. Right
at the moment, we are not the
least bit concerned with
technical problems. We need

‘to get enthused.”’
