About-Face

The re-interpretation of North
Carolina’s ABC laws by the state at-
torney general’s office raises some
interesting questions for the Davidson
student.

On the one hand, the Mecklenburg
ABC Board considers a dormitory
room a home, and consequently the
only place a student may legally store
liquor. On the other hand, the fac-
ulty rules state that the only legal
place for liquor storage is in a car
trunk, which is off-limits, according
to the attorney general’s ruling.

Basically, the confusion can be at-
tributed to a complete about-face by
the attorney general’s office from a
1961 interpretation of the 1923 Tur-
lington Act: passed while even the
sale or possession of liquor was for-
bidden by a constitutional amend-
ment.

When the faculty instituted the
trunk rule last year, it did so under
the understanding that possession of
liquor outside of the home was en-
tirely within the law.

Obviously the most reasonable so-
lution to the problem lies in a re-

The New Look

Two separate events this week have
ointed to what may be the “new look”
in the Davidson fraternity system.
Both the report of the Social Life Eval-
uation Committee and the speech at
the IFC’s pledge banquet placed re-
sponsibility for modernizing the sys-
tem squarely on the shoulders of the
fraternity system.

At the same time, both statements
called attention to the positive role
that fraternities play here and ex-
pressed an optimism in the system’s
future.

To most Davidson students, condi-
tioned to the idea that all representa-
tives of the Hill are anti-fraternity,
the Committee’s report will come as
a pleasant surprise. The positive ap-
proach to the fraternity’s position on
campus and reluctance to place com-
plete blame on fraternities for cam-
pus social and intellectual problemis is
commendable. To the casual raeder,
the report might almost appear to be
a commendation to the system.

But the lack of any specific pro-
posals should not mislead the reader
into thinking the system has escaped
any responsibility for improving both
itself and the campus as a whole.

While the committee was somewhat
vague as to what it expected of fra-
ternities, it was morally and legally
right in calling for a new orientation
While it defended fraternities’ right to
be primarily social groups, it called
for a broadening of their scopes. The
central place of. fraternities on cam-
pus makes it imperative that they also
be willing to assume certain respon-
sibilities in campus life.

The mere existence of such a re-
port, asserting the positive contribu-
tions and integral position of the fra-
ternity on this campus, is in itself en
couraging to us, and the report should
spur fraternity men on to taking the
initiative in reforming the fraternity
system.

The committe’s report is prooi that
the system does have friends on the
faculty and administration who are
willing to work to bring about a viable
social system for the entire campus.

The speech by William LeClere
Monday also revealed an unusual twist,

peal of the law by the state legisla-
ture. But at the very earliest the
lawmakers will have to wait until
next year. In the meantime the next
most desirable plan of action lies in
a test case to be taken to the State
Supreme Court. Such a ruling, no

atter what the outcome, would serve
to at least clarify the issue. As the
situation now stands, the attorney gen-
eral’s decision has no legal standing
and is accepted by custom only.

It appears that, due to the long-
standing acceptance of the old inter-
pretation, there may be a good chance
of a court ruling overturning the at-
torney general's decision. A suit has
already been filed to stop enforce-
ment, though its exact status is un-
certain.

At any rate. the announcement
that county police will begin en-
forcement of the law today seems
to hold little application to the Dav-
idson student. As long as he is rea-
sonably discreet, there seems to be no
immediate need for student alarm
or faculty action before the situation
has been clarified in one way or an-
other.

but from a different angle from the
report of the Social Life Evaluation
Committee. The idea of a professional
fraternity man, speaking at an IFC-
sponsored function, commenting that
“maybe what you need is a lousy rush”
to make fraternities face up to their
needs for revitalization seems almost
comical.

It is encouraging that the frater-
nities themselves, at least to a cer-
tain degree, are facing up to the need
for an inner reform.

The response to Mr. William Le-
Clere’'s talk, in the form of questions
and coments from the audience, indi-
cates that some fraternity men are
indeed thinking seriously about the
problem. Perhaps pledges, with only
six weeks of exposure to fraternity
life, wil! begin looking for: means of
improving the system and looking be-
yond the rut described by Mr. Le-
Clere as “keg, combo and collections
of couples.”

Hour Of Reckoning

Elsewhere in this issue, Registrar
F. W. Hengeveld reports that a rash
of professors’ turning in grades late
caused mid-semester reports to be
sent out considerably later than usual
this year.

While we cannot condone such a

lack of promptness on the parts of °

our professors, we can report that a
system 6f delaying grades until the
end of the spring holidays is a vast
improvement.

One of the bleaker aspects of. the
yearly respite has been the tradition
,al explanation to concerned parents
of a failure to obtain the expected aca-
demic excellence. Mercifully, this
year, such an explanation was unnec.-
essary.

Our only suggestion to the registrar
would be that he forewarn us in the
future that grades will be late, to
prevent the daily ritual of having to be
first member of the household to the
mailbox. Such foreknowledge would
save endless hours of agony spent in
wondering exactly when the hour of
reckoning will be.

Spring Holidays Bring Hopes, Regrets

Spring break has ended. The
hope is that we can now return
with a refreshed attitude that
will allow easy completion of the
year’s work. The longest ‘‘no
break" stretch of the year is
over, and you can breathe a con-
tented sigh from the smug se-
curity of a vacation which al-
lowed plenty of time to get all
back work finished and even ol-
fered the chance to get a little
ahead.

But we must be careful: spring
break also opened the season of
procrastination when it is genrr-
ally in order to do anything to
keep from opening the books.

The long days make it easier
to get a lot of outside work done
(especially at the lake campus),
and there is always the prospect
of another summer with some-
thing different (even if it\is only
ROTC summer camp) that will
occupy our thoughts and cause
our minds to wander. 'We all
have guestions as to the value
of spring vacation and if we
don't, we should.

BETTER THINGS

The week of. spring vacation
brings promise of better things
to come. Anyone who isn't be-
hind in his work by this time is
either a freshman who still be-

everything in order to pass or a

second-semester senior who real-
ly doesn’t have that much to do
anyway.

The winter lull after first sem-
ester exams has been a good ex-
ercise in how to get behind with-
out really trying because nothing
is new; the days are lousy; the
end of the year is a long way
off, and there doesn't seem to be
much future to anything, least
of all the school work. The only
realists in the spring are those
who take off from the books and
forget them for a week.

LEAVE BOOKS

There is something about the
psychology of vacations that pro-
motes a marked antipathy be-
tween student and studies. I
wonder how long it will take
most of us to know that we
might as well leave all our
books right here on campus and
really “blow it out'' on week-
ends and vacations?

There is a question of intell-
ectual honesty here which the
season forbids discussing. By
this time of the year we have

Brotherhood At Last

taken books with us on every
vacation except semester break.
How much does anyone get done
over vacation? No one will admit
doing anything, and those that
do give some semblance of an
answer have usually read every
bit of one paperback novel which
had already been half completed
before vacation began.

INCONVENIENT VACATION

A little thought can easily
bring one to the realization that
a week long vacation, especially
in the spring. is the most incon-
venient length vacation concei-
able. Two days or three weeks
are obviously much more ac-
ceptable, and in this day of
great intellectual foresight (or
is it hindsight?) continued re-
thinking of old ideas, the longer
period would seem most suitable.

Only while looking forward to
a spring vacation of two days or
three weeks cana student be
entirely realistic and honest ‘in
making his plans. A week for
a vacation is unsatisfactory be-
cause it causes the student to

fool himself and others miser-
ably.

FLORIDA OR NASSAU

If we were given a two day
spring break, then no one would
try to do any studying. All books
could be left on campus with a
clear conscience, and by careful
planning of class cuts you could
still get all the way to Florida
or Nassau and back in just as
much of a run down condition
as you are able to develop in a
week.

There would no longer be the
added pressure of the stacks of
books on the desk at home each
time you go to your room to
change clothes for another date.
(After all, you had to go home
to write that term paper). Two
days on the beach allow you to
meet almost as many girls as
you can in a week, and this
amount of time denies you most
of the problems which can crop
up after a week of mixed-up
dates.

GUILT FEELINGS

Compared to a. two-day vaca
lion a week is just too long. In
a week long vacation you cannot
count all the spare time that
you'll have, and you even find
that you can spend an entire day
doing what you wish to do: Then
the guilt feelings arise, but they
are not great enough to cause
you to tackle the ominous stack
of books.

It is even easy to spend such
a day or a week of such days
without getting anything done ex-
cept reading four or five .pages
of history before falling asleep.
Concentrated study is impossi-
ble, and remorse only arises
after the return to campus.

The entire week is spent in
delusions of how much time
there is left. At the beginning
it is amazing how long the days
are and how much you can
plan to do those last few days.
By the end of the week the days
are so short that there really
isn’t any point in beginning any-
thing new.

The pressure from the omni-
present ominous stack of books
is not even great enough to get
you out of bed before ten in the
morning to get a little work
done. Resolutions don't work
either. On vacation anything.
even visiting New Friends For
Davidson, is preferable to study-

Smith Points To Shortcomings
In ‘Work-Week' Vespers Theory

Dear Editor:

One .of the arguments which
has been advanced in defense of
the present system of Vespers
is that it requires students to

come back to the campus on
Sunday evenings. Thus students
have time to do a few hours of
work and get a good night's
sleep before Monday classes.

Speech Changes Mark
World Without Accent

Men always have paid too
much and too little --attention
to their own and others’ speech.
Back -in the days of the Judges.
forty and two thousand Ephrai-
smites were - slain when they
“could not frame to pronounce”
the word Shibboleth aright. Pe-
ter was recognized .as a Gali-
lean because. as one of his ac-
cusers said, “thy speech betray-
eth thee.’ And King Lear warn-
ed Cordelia, ‘‘“Mend your speech
a little, Lest you mar your for-
tunes."

There are lands (England for
example) where too much atten-
tion may be paid to one’s accent.
There are others (America. for
example) where too little often is
paid. While Shaw's ‘’Pygma-
lion” reflected the first, we
sometimes wonder whether a
similar play might not have its
good effect in the United States
—particularly when we note the
spread of the hideous flat “‘o”
(resulting in ahrange juice, cup
of cahfee and Rahls Royce).

Now from England comes
word that “‘the best English ac-
cent is no accent at all” (of
course. this is an impossibility:
everyone without exception
speaks doth with an accent and
in dialect). Both upper-and low-
er-class accents are said to be
tending toward a middle meeting
ground. Radio, television, wider
economic opportunities. and bet-
ter education are said to be re-
sponsible.

In the United States a grow-
ing number of universities, co)-
Jeges, and institutions are work
ing to eliminate those peculiari-
ties of Negro speech which are
found to be a serious barrier to
economic and cultural advance-

ment.

All these changes are doubt-
less inevitable and may, on the
whole. be for the best, But we
cannot help regretting them. a
bit. When we are told that such-
and-such an actress is from Ala-
bama and then [find that her soft
Southern accent has been trained
away to a nonregional standardi-
zation, we confess to disappoint-
ment. Or, when we heard T. S.
Eliot, a product of St., Louis,
out-Oxford Oxford, we could
never suppress a feeling of won-
derment.

Today's question is: How far

should we seek to hide those
revealings?

(a eee:

The basic point of the argument
is that Vespers helps to main-
tain a work week of adequate
length. .

There is an important distinc-
tion between the amount of work
one does and the amount of
time spent doing it. It seems’ to
me that it is the responsibility
of the faculty to see that stu-
dents do a certain amount of
work, and that the work be of a
certain quality.

They can do this by making
proper assignments, giving
writs, reviews and exams and
requiring papers. Their real
power to see that enough good
work is done resides in the grade
book, and in their personal in-
fluence upon students.

On the other hand, given the
work to be done, it is the re-
sponsibility of the student to de-
cide how much time he must
spend in doing it, and when this
time will be. Students should
be required to do the work —
not to spend six days doing it or
to do it on Sunday evenings, as
the work week argument for
Vespers attempts to do.

But that is not all the work-
week argument attempts. It also
seeks to bring students back to
campus for a good night's sleep
before classes. To do this, Ves-
pers is not enough. We must al-
so have rules that students be
in bed by midnight with the
lights out — not only on Sunday
but on all other work nights.
Then they must be required to go
to sleep. Clearly, the consistent

' application of this argument

shows it to be absurd.

It seems to me that this argu-
ment about the work week cam-
ouflages the real issues in the
Vespers debate. The primary
issue is whether Davidson is to
have a religious program which
is really effective.

Will the values and beliefs for
which the college stands be pre-
sented to ‘students in the most
attractive, persuasive, compell-
ing way possible? ~

Another question is whether
the college will give students the
freedom to witness by their ac-
tions whatever they may come
to believe as a result of their
education at Davidson. I hope
the question will be decided on

these grounds, and not because
of much less valid and import-
ant considerations.

UNREAD NOVELS

But let us consider the more
taxing three-week alternative to
the one-week vacation. Here you
could take with you the usuaj
amount of books which includes
a term paper, all assignments
which are overdue, the short
paper due the week after you re.
turn and ‘those two novels you
had been putting off redding.

For one week you would be
allowed to really enjoy yourself
free of the cares of the ominous
stack of books. (In the spring
when you have three weeks you
can forget an ominious stack of
books for one week.)"’

Then, after completely running
yourself ragged, you could re-
turn to a normal week of con-
valescence (the equivalent of the
week after spring break under
the present system). In this se.
cond week you could perfectly
plan your work for the remain
der of the semester and even be-
gin an attempt at diminishing
the number of books to be cover-
ed, either by doing the work or
deciding it could wait until you
get back. (It is important to
keep in mind that there is one
entire week after this in which
anything left undone can be
completed.)

RECUPERATION GODS

After this second week which,
in all intellectual honesty, you
knew would be pretty well sac.
rificed to the ‘*gods of recupera-
tion” you should be prepared to
finish that first novel. This is the
one that was already half com-
pleted when you got home.

At this point you can return to
school refreshed in the belief
that you had a well organized
and unhurried spring vacation.
Even the three-week vacation
has its problems where studies
are concerned, but at least it
allows more time for organiza-
tional purposes for the comple-
tion of the semester's work.

Like so many other things: of
our day and age we can see that
the one-week spring break is an
out-moded thing of the past.
Must we cling to such vestiges
of an age gone by when we can
use our newly acquired know-
ledge to choose a more suitable
length of vacation. one which
meets the needs of the day?

We search for honesty and con-
sistency today. Why do in one
week what can be as effectively
done in two days or even three

,weeks? (The latter I find some-

what more acceptable as it
does contribute to the idea of the
“study-oriented" vacation which
is so popular today.)

Whatever the length vacation,
we know that anything left un-
done will get done sooner or
later, and well, we work better
under pressure anyway. We all
know there are two full months
of class days lef. plenty of
time. It’s that kind of season.

Campus Religion

Dear Editor:

On a recent missionary jour.
ney to Davidson, during the heat
of .the Vespers boycott move-

-ment, I was goaded into an ex-

amination of the religious situa-
tion on campus. Here are a few
observations and comments.

1, Compulsory Vespers Is self-
defeating in that it promotes
corporate blasphemy instead of
corporate worship. The preacher

is outvoted 231 to 1 (if attend.

ance is that good), and God gets
the black ball. However this is
an indictment of the students
and not God, or the goals of the
college.

2. Students passionately pro-
test for Freedom FROM religion
with no intention of using their
Freedom FOR anything. Expell-

ing one demon from the house
creates a vacuum which will
suck in. seven other demons
worse than the first. ‘‘and the
last state of that man becomes
worse than the first.”

3. The students still live in the
19th century theologically: .i.e..
they either attack and reject or
desperately cling to a 19th cen-
tury brand of. Christianity.

4, The only. effective witness
made on campus is by students
to fellow students. The campus
is immune to faculty and im
ported preachers.

5. Students who neglect private
devotions commit spiritual sui-
cide.
