BROWN 1S HEARD
BY LOGAL GROUP

Dr. C. K. Brown Addresses Eu-
menean Literary Society At
Regular Meeting

Dr. C. K. Brown, in speaking before
the members of the Eumenean Literary
Society last Tuesday night, said that the
reason literary societies were losing out
today was that their members had no
common interests to discuss.

Dr. Brown said that he regretted this
waning interest in the Eumenean and
Philanthropic societies, and he attributed
it to the attitude of students today, who
take no interest in subjects which for-
merly were discussed in the halls.

“We are no longer well informed on
political questions,” he said, “and we
look on politics not as a career to be
planned for, but rather to be avoided.
Until we change this view, and a gov-
erning class with higher ideals arises,
there will be no demand for great lead-
ers, who can sway and control tthe
masses. When such a need arises then
interest in literary societies will revive.
because they offer training in those re-
quirements which would be needed.”

The regular order of business was
transacted, and then the meeting was
concluded with a feed and. social hour.

Dr. Brown's invitation to speak before
the Eumenean -Society is a part of a
program to revive interest in the prin-
ciples for which the literary societies at
Davidson stand. In the future other
members of the faculty will probably be
asked to address the hall.

Davidson Scout Troop
Begins Reorganization

The Davidson Scout Troop has recent-
ly started to reorganize under the lead-
ership of Dick Vowles, Harman Wood-
ward, and Gordon Cleveland.

This troop has been disbanded since
last May when they lost their meeting
place, a small building in the high school
yard.’ The troop now has this meeting
place again and is ready to get back to
work, There are about fifteen boys in|
the troop at present; |they will welcome
any boys over twelve years old who are
interested in this work.

This troop was under the leadership
of Ed’ Hodge last year and undertook
several “Good Turns” to the community.
Among other things, they set out 1,500
trees on the golf course and collected
over 300 pieces of cloth for the Red
Cross.

port as delegate to the Triennial Con-
ference of Phi Beta Kappa, which met
in Cincinnati, Ohio, in September. Dr.
Gwynn said that four colleges were rec-
ommended for new chapters of Phi Beta
Kappa. Only three were selected, how-
ever. They were Florida State College
for Women at Tallahassee, University of
Utah, and Connecticut State College for
Women ,at New London.

The Gamma Chapter has received a
letter from Dr. W. A. Shimer, secretary
of the National Chapter, saying that he
would visit Davidson on May 2. He
expresses a desire to become better ac-
quainted with the members of the local
chapter and with Davidson College. The
president of the chapter will appoint a
committee of three to plan. for his en-
tertainment.

ter are: Prof. A. Currie, president; Mr.
F. L. Jackson, vice-president, and Dr.

The Gamma Chapter of Phi Beta Kap-
pa was established at Davidson eleven
years ago. Davidson, with the Univer-
sity of North Carolina and Duke Uni-
versity, are the only institutions in the
state possessing chapters of the nation-
ally-known fraternity. This is a great
compliment to the scholastic rating of
the college. Davidson is the smallest
of the aforementioned schools and has
one of the highest scholastic_ratings in
the South. Twenty-four members of the
Davidson faculty are members of Phi
Beta Kappa.

Ministerial Group
Sends Deputation

Alexander Leads Services
Charlotte Church; Salango
Renders Solo

The last meeting of the Ministerial
Band was held on Sunday, February 24,
in the afternoon. Frank Pharr made a
short talk on “Love.” ‘Then, after a
short business discussion, the group was
dismissed with a prayer.

That evening at 6:30 in the Caldwell
Memorial Church of Charlotte, a depu-
tation from the group gave a program
at the meeting of the Young People’s
League. The program was led by Jack
Alexander. After the scripture, which
was read by the leader, James Salango
gave a solo. Two talks were given, one
by Murphy Smith, in which he discussed
the physical side of love, showing its
development, . growth, and likeness~to
Christ's, and. the other, by Monroe
Wicker, who told his listeners about the
love of God and its superiority over all
others. The whole program carried out
the thought of “Love.”

The Ministerial Band has been asked
to take charge of the Young People’s
League of the Davidson Presbyterian
Church, and to try to get this League
to functioning smoothly again. In’ view
of this fact, the Band urges those who
are interested in this work to be pres-
ent at every meeting. It meets each
Sunday evening at 7 o'clock in the
church.

NEW KIND OF WAR LEAGUE

Iowa City, Ia—A “League for the
Promotion.of War” has been organized
at the University of Iowa.

Founded by a group of students who
believe that dictatorship is the only so-
lution for the complex problems of mod-
ern civilization, the new club is opposed
to another group here which is advocat-
ing world peace.

Compulsory military training for all
male citizens in the United States was
one of the resolutions passed at the first
meeting of the organization. In addi-
tion, if this club has its way, all college
students, both men and women, would
be required to take four years of mili-
tary study.

The group leaders plan to invite Huey
P. Long to become its honorary leader.

for new and flashy uniforms, urging that
those who would-drop a contribution in
the boxes at the rear‘of the platform
before leaving.

Following Dr. Gwynn’s short talk, the
band left the stage, and most of the au-
dience went outside for a breath of air,
only to be- called back to their seats
after ten minutes by a loud blast of the
trumpet.

The first number on the second half
of the program was “Hungarian Fan-
tasy,” featuring the skillful fingers of
Mrs. Louise Nelson Pfohl, pianist of
extraordinary ability. With her every
move characterized by grace, Mrs. Pfohl
played through the difficult
piece twenty min-

music. This Liszt composition was
played from manuscript, the arrange-

ment for piano and band, a most un-
usual combination, having been made by
the director of the University of Michi-
gan Band, of which Pfohl
was once a member. So loudly did her
audience acclaim Mrs. Pfohl’s artistry
that she was called from the wings twice
for bows.

The next piece on the program was
Ravel's “Bolero,” already made popular
on this campus by the band. At its con-
clusion the ever-familiar and ever-pop-
ular strains of “O Davidson” filled the
auditorium, bringing a loyal audience at
once to its feet. This closed the first
formal concert by the band on the cam-
pus this year, and a well-pleased body of
listeners filed from the building.
