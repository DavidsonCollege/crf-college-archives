IN THRILLING GAME

To Pile Up Big Lead Over
Dazed Bulldogs

CITADEL FIGHTS GAMELY

Armstrong and Iverson Lead
Scoring For Davidson

In a game that was surpris-
ingly close for three quarters,
the Wildcats strengthened
their hold on eighth place in
Southern Conference  stand-
ings by beating the Citadel
Bulldogs 46 to 34 here Mon-
day night.

Davidson started the game with
a quintet composed of Ned Iverson,
Maurice Peabody, Bill Hancock,
John Armstrong, and Bill Kiese-
Wetter. Midway of the first half
Citadel led by a score of 11 to 6
and Captain Bill Quick, J. D. Hicks
and John Tice entered the game for
Davidson. Paced by Armstrong
and Quick the Cats tied the score,
but just before the end of the first
half Citadel put in a field goal and
two free shots to gain a 22-18 lead
as the horn sounded. In this half
the Lairdmen seemed over-confi-
dent, played listlessly at times, and
were shooting poorly.

At the beginning of the second
the Bulldogs forged steadily, ahead
until, with only ten minutes to go,
they led, 30-20. With time running
short and: their opponents freezing
the ball, things looked dark for the
Wildcats. Davidson took time out
and it was a changed team that be-
gan play again. Armstrong started
the rally by sinking a field goal. A
moment later he got another, sand-
wiched in by two from the big
paws of Hicks. The scarlet-clad
warriors were playing splendid ball
a, ROW, making every shot count.
FYom this pvint.on the issue was
never in doubt as Davidson won
going away.

Friday night the Cats went down
before a highly-geared State team
to the tune of 51 to 34. Led by Con-
nie Mack Berry, who racked up 23
points, Coach Sermon’s team turned
in one of its best performances of
the season. Iverson and Quick play-
ed best for Davidson and Tice also
looked good. In a non-conference
game here last Wednesday the
Davidson quint breezed to easy vic-
tory over the Guilford Quakers.

Laird started his second team and
sent the varsity in after eleven
minutes on the short end of an 11-6
score. The first-stringers ran up
a lead and were never headed. The
subs played part of the last half.

ARE. SELECTED

Historic American Building
Survey Chooses Two Dav-
idson Halls

Further distinction came to Dav-
idson recently when it was an-
nounced that the architects of the
Historic American Building Survey
had selected Eu and Phi Halts as
outstanding examples of early Am-
erican architecture. These halls, for
land marks the
Davidson campus, will be preserved

years historic on
in the archives of the department of
the interior in Washington.

Eu Hall has gained particular
note through the fact that Wood
row Wilson made his first public
speech from its rostrum. Both so-
the
ings gained their names have turned

ciettes from which two build-
out many famous personages.

To the Eumenean goes the credit
for the first movement toward ac-
tual building but the Phi’s followed
closely, it being agreed that the
halls be alike in “size, material, and
magnificance,” and should (at that
time) cost $1,500 each.

It is the Phi hall which contains
a chandelier the exact duplicate of
the original under which Napoleon
III was married to Eugenie de
Montigi, Comtesse de Teba, in 1853.
It was bought by William White
of Sumter, S. C., and reputed to
have been presented to the college
by him.

NEW CONSTITUTION
TO BE CONSIDERED

Edwards Will Submit Clarified
Constitution to Student
Body

NO MAJOR ALTERATIONS

Each Section Will Be Voted on
Separately

, Wilbur Edwards, president
of the student body, in con-
junction with a constitutional
committee, has written a re-
vision of the Constitution of
the Student Body of Davidson
College which will be present-
ed to the student body for
adoption next Friday. —

This revision of the constitution

involves no major changes. Its pur-
Pose is to clarify the existing con-
stitution, to incorporate amend-

ments which have been passed in
‘the last few years into the main
body of the constitution, and rear-
range the whole in a more logical
and usable order.

The present student body consti-
tution was adopted in 1912, when
student government at Davidson
was first organized along its present.
lines. Since that time no revision
has been made. Some errors have
inevitably crept in, and some of the
amendments which have been pass-
ed have been incorporated in the
body of the constitution, while
others have been added at the end.

Realizing that the existing con-
stitution does not adequately out-
line Davidson's famed system. of
student government, the president
of the student body undertook to
write a revision, for the purpose of
rearrangement and clarification.
The was referred to~Dr.
Archibald Currie for legal advice
and was then studied and corrected
by a committee of students consist-
ing of Bill Kieseweter, Bill Mar-
Dave Newbold, Watson
Street, Julian Squires, Tom Thurs-
ton, and John Winn. After being
passed by the student council it will

Jarker, who has the reputa-

school and college ‘students than
any other man, quoted the three
things which, according to Presi-
dent Garfield, were necessary to
success! a strong arm, a clear head,
and a brave heart

By “strong arm,” he meant the

ability to do a great deal of work

in the world. The price for that
wbility he said was 15 minutes of
chest and abdominal exercises every
day.

The clear head, which was not
speed in getting lessons, but the
ability to think clearly, was, more
difficult to ‘get. He applied Hux
ley's definition of education: “The
chief purpose of education is to
train the mind and the will to do

the work you have to do when that

ought to be done, whether

you like to do it or not.” In line

work

with that idea, he recommended two
things to be done every time one
studies:

1. To force your mind to concen-
trate}; and

2. To come quickly back to the
subject every time you catch your
mind wandering.

Having a brave heart, he said,
meant having the courage to say
“nol? when your conscience dic-
tates it.
