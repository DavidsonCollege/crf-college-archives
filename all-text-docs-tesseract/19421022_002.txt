“The Reserves...

The usual run of rumors have whis-
pered there way across the campus, leav-
ing in their wake worry and indecision,
this time regarding the Reserve Board
here yesterday, :

As the officers announced, they are
to be tollowed within two weeks by a
recruiting board, which will sign any
student who is interested and qualified
in the branch of his choice:

The R.O.T.C, department, at press
time Monday, made it clear that they
had received no of ficial notice that every
student would be required. to signin one
of the reserve pregrams, nor did they
expect to receive such an order. As far
as they know the program is still entirely
optional,

We have done our best to keep the

war out of this paper as far as possible.

We have felt that the function of a col-

lege publication is to concern itself pri-
marily with campus activities and to
leave the prosecution of the war to those
equipped to interpret it.

Whenever something arises that di-
rectly affects the sttidents or when an
Opportunity arises for the members of
the Davidson student body to aid in the
war cffort, then we’ shall bring the
matter before them as clearly, forcefully,
and as accurately as possible.

Such an opportunity is presented by
these reserve programs. We have heard
a number of students express a senti-
ment which evidences, it would seem, a
rather warped. idea of the duty of the
college man-in the war period.

This attitude has shown itself in state-

ments to the effect that they did not «

wish to receive officer’s training in any
branch of the service; that an officer has
too many responsibilities, and that they
would rather remain privates and let
someone else do the worrying,

Tf this feeling were at all prevalent in
the educational institutions of this na-

tion. as we cannot believe, the country

would indeed be in dire peril. If the
leaders of the armed forces have shown
their dependence on college men as a
source of officer material, they have evi-
dericed their faith in the educated and
the leadership that eduéation develops by
offering to present them with commis-
sions atter a brief period of intensified
nlitary training.

Any student who has the intelligence
and psychological balance to make a suc-
ess of his college life has. no right to
waste his abilities by submereing them
when he has this opportunity to exploit
and develop these talents:

We hesitate to designate any course
as the direct duty of all or any student,
Hut we would like to urge all to consider
well the problems before them, Tf we
‘ho are presumably equipped to serve,

's not employ our ability, then what

“ave we a right to expect of those of
lesser background,

We would like to see, therefore, every
student who is not affiliated with some
reserve program make every effort to do

so when the recruiting board arrives.

With The Staff

By HOWELL MORROW

Unfortunately the Davidson College campus
has always been an especially fertile’ spot for the
growth of a certain infection which is caused by
a sometimes dangerous germ known as the rumor
When we stop to consider the number of ‘sayings
that the seven hundred odd togues on the Davidson

campus are capable ¢

f uttering in the space of

one day and the numerous changes, additions, and
omissions which each story will probably undergo,
we can get some idea of the way an unfounded
rumor can take possession of the entire student
body. aires

Many of the rumors talk

of the campus from time to time are harmless in

which become the
nature, and no one actually.suffers from their
circulation. However the rapidity with which
stories spread and'the eagerness with which people
believe them should serve as a warning against
the harm that a more Vicious and demoralizing type

of false news could produce.

There are two types of stories which can be
very injurious to individuals and to the college as
a whole. In the first class we find those sayings
which affect individual personalities on the cam-
Many

and

pus. unfounded tales,

told at first in sa

joking off-hand manner, have cause much

undeserved suffering to certain persons

Perhaps the worst reports are those which, if
true, would affect the entire student body or a
large portion of it. Under this category. will be
listed those wild talks about some radical change
in the draft status of college men or misstatements
concerning the policies of Davidson College. Im-
portant statements of general interest should not
be repeated unless the source is reliable and. the

knowledge of such news of value to all concerned.

College communities have a distinct advantage
over other parts of our nation in several ways.
They should be strongholds for enlightened-minds
and clear thinking. They should, during this trying
hour in our nation’s history, stand for sane thought

and sane action in all things.

Men of college age are today faced with’ a
greater problem than any other single group of
individuals. These men are nearly all within the
ages during which military service will be required
of them.

Rumors such as those encouraging Freshmen
to withdraw from school now and volunteer their
services in some branch of the armed forces because
of the impossibility of completing this year's
work should be suppressed. Of course,
we do not know what the future holds, but we
have been assured from all sources that the best
policy. for students to adopt is to remain in
school for the® completion of this year's work or
to enlist in one of the numerous reserve branches
of the armed forces. ‘

college

It is not our purpose to advise men concerning
the course of action they should follow in their
daily activities or in the present emergency, but
we simply wish to impress upon all the danger of
pursuing idle gossip which might result in a
scare that will only contribute to the war of
nerves which our enemies would like so well to
use—successfully against us.

more,

Simply ask a girl’ to spend the
weekend here! Now isn’t that revo-
lutionary? Yet so simple, and solves
your problem. ;

To illustrate what a good idea my
plan is, I'll show you the variety
of entertainments offered.

Suppose your girl arrives at noon
Saturday. You take her to her room
in the Guest House—then to lunch
where you introduce her to your
friends (the snakes!) After lunch
there is nothing more entertaining
than the Saturday afternoon movie,
wherein students will continually
make cute and clever remarks that
your date will appreciate. Spend
the rest of the afternoon at Hugo’s’

*reading magazines.

After supper a couple of rubbers

* of bridge will be appropriate, Then

at nine o'clock there will be some

real entertainment—planned by the
Eu social_.committee to entertain
those on the campus. Perhaps on
this particular Saturday there will
be an old-fashioned song session.
What could be more fun than sing-
ing “I've Been Working on the Rail-
road,” or “In the Evening”?

The midnight show is always a

: —_
thriller. Then on Sunday there are,
of course, S#pday School and
Church.

Don't ever try to get romantic,
however. This-is the only drawback
to my little scheme, but even so,
you can enjoy some good clean fun.
To illustrate my don't-get-romantic
point; one student did have a date
here last weekend! He went with
her into the chapter room at his
fraternity house, ~closed—the~ door;
and fifteen seconds later there were
six students peering in at/each win-
dow and two through the keyhole—
yelling such remarks as, “Hang one
on 'er, Sedley,” or “Will she neck?’
or “Show us your technique, Sed-
ley! Tee hee, tee, heé, hee hee hee.”

You'll find my system delightful,
no doubt. But remember—nothing
but good clean fun. What could be
more enjoyable? (Censored).
