Pitt Rabbi Discusses

‘God Is Dead’ Theme _

Dr. Richard Rubenstein, Con-
servative rabbi and chaplain to
Jewish students at Pittsburgh
and Duquesne Universities, gave
a series of lectures Monday on
the “Death of God" theology.

In addition to being an or-
dained rabbi and theologian, Ru-
benstein is a French professor
at Pitt and is an expert on the
works of Camus and other
French existentialists.

“Playboy” magazine recently
interviewed him concerning the
‘Death of God"’ theology and the
interview is scheduled to be pub-
lished later this spring.

Rubenstein appeared at David-
son under the auspices of the
YMCA. In his chapel speech
Monday morning he discussed
both the Christian and Jewish
views of the “Death of God"
theology. His understanding of
theology is based on a relation-
ship between Freudian psychol-
ogy and religion.

Rubenstein traced the origin of
God, the father concept of both
Christianity and Judaism, to
primitive man. Man firs€ form-
ed ‘primal hordes” which were
dominated by a tyrannical fa-
ther to whom all the females of
the horde belonged.

When the young men of the
tribe came to age, they killed the
father in order to win his fe-
males. These men were jealous,
yet they desired to identify with
the father and his power, so they
ate him, assuming his substance.

Rubenstein cited the Jewish
practice of sacrifice and the
Catholic doctrine of transubstan-
tiation as examples of the first
primitive acts. Having murdered
the father, the sons felt guil-
ty and could no longer calculate
his power so they elevated him
from his original physical status
to a heavenly concept of God.

Rubenstein says that the
“Death of God” problem is not
new and that if Freud’s myth is
believed, religion developed from

New Rules Decide
Dorm Counselors

Hall counselors for the coming
year, chosen this week accord-
ing to a revised set of standards,
will have additional duties, ac-
cording to Mrs. Peter Nicholls,
director of dormitories.

The group of counselors in-
cludes Bill Watson and Tom Ir-
ons, Sheff Owen and Neville Pat-
terscn, Don Carroll and Chris
Hawk, John Allen and Tom
Clayton, Marvin Sparrow and
Bill Seigler. Bobby Burch and
Rusty Brannon.

Also, Bobby Lane and Barry
St. Clair. Ronnie Hunt and Mike
Mooty. Ken Tarleton and Don
Goodman. Cecil Clifton and Juli-
an Prosser, Paul Marion and
Gary DeVane.

Mrs. Nicholls said that choos-
ing hall counselors this year was
especially difficult because ‘‘so
many things had to be consid-
ered.’ She and Dean of Stu-
dents Richard C. Burts. who
make the choices, attempted to
give equal representation to all
fraternities and Independents.
This was especially difficult
s‘nce many applied from some
fraternities. while few applied
from others, she stated.

Mrs. Nicholls stated that a de-
cision was made with the con-
sent of Coach Homer Smith not
to choose any football players.
The reason was that football
players will be at football camp
for the first two days of school
and will be away on Freshman
Parents Day.

Since these are three of the
most important days for fresh-
men, it was decided to eliminate
football players. YMCA Camp
counselors also were not chosen
because, said Mrs. Nicholls, ‘‘We
have so much talent—why con-
centrate it?"

The changed role of the coun-
selors involves the requirement
that they hold hall meetings once
a week for the entire year. Dur-
ing Freshman Orientation Week.
they will serve as group lead-

ers, because the groups
will be organized by halls, she
added.

The hall counselors will prob-
ably make out several reports on
their freshmen during the course
of the year. However, Mrs. Nich-
olls stated, “I don’t know honest-
ly whether they serve any pur-
pose in a community as small
as ours.”’.

murder and the Cross is the re-
capitulation of the original mur-
der of God. The murder of God's
son is the atonement for the orig-
inal murder. Christians can find
atonement in the Resurrection
but Jews must find atonement
through the law.

Monday evening Rubenstein

continued his explanation of his -

theology, stating that the ancient
jealousy and hatred of the fa-

ther has been directed in modern j

society toward the clergyman

and rabbi. He said that since ,

Auschwitz and the slaughter of
millions of Jews in the Second
World War he has made a dras-
tic reappraisal of the traditional
view of Jewish history.

Either Adolf Hitler was the in-
strument of God's revenge or
God is dead. Rubenstein accepts

the latter vief and adopts an ex- ©

istential attitude toward moral-
ity. He says that man can do
anything that he wants without
being subject to the will of an
omnipotent being, but the indi-
vidual must be willling to ac-
cept for himself the consequenc-
es of his act.

fourth volume of verse, *‘Buck-
dancer’s Choice.’ In addition,
this edition won the Melville
Cane Award.

On this new collection of po-
ems Dickens wrote, “This book
is intended to extend and ampli-
fy the themes already present
in my three other books. There
is a rather large portion of fan-
tastically ambitious poetry in
this one, and and in addition
some technical experimentation
mak‘ag use of something I call
the ‘split Nne.’

“This is a device for repro.
ducing, I hope. the squence of
thought in the mind in a rapid
and discontinuous manner more
nearly like (as nearly as I can
tell) what really happens when
one thinks, reflects or dreams.

“I don't know how much valte
this device has, but it cnables:
me to get some effects I can't
seem to gel in any other way.”

On Thursday. April 7, Dickey
will meet with an advanced com.
position class and visit with oth
er interested students. That eve.
ning he will have a reading of
his poetry.

~'Significant Changes”

Davidson’s Religious Life Committee will present a
report to the faculty next month which, according to

Chaplain Will Terry,

will recommend

“significant

changes to enhance the Christian commitment of the
college in the eyes of the student body.”

The committee met Tuesday
to begin to draw up its report
and plans to meet once again
before the monthly faculty meet-
ing scheduled for April 5.

The proposals, centering large-
ly on Davidson's compulsory
Vespers program, will not be
made public until after the fae-
ulty meets because, according to
committee chairman Terry, “‘the
faculty should hear them before
they get noised around.”

The report, which will also in-
clude a statement about chapel,
will be the result of two years
of study.

“The action of the committee
will come out of a long series of
talks, reports of many students
and letters to other schools,”
said Murray Smith, student com-
mittee member and YMCA pres-
ident.

Smith said that the committee
considered two sources of stu-
dent opinion in its Tuesday meet-
ing: a petition signed by 710 stu-
dents and a random survey of
100 students ‘‘most likely to have
responsible views.”

The petition urged the aboli-
tion of compulsory vespers, and
the survey, conducted by stu-
dent committee member Mike
Mooty, was “overwhelmingly
unanimous—of over 50 question-
naires returned, only two favor-
ed retaining Vespers."

Smith also said that both the
size and effect of last Sunday's
boycott. were ‘“‘negligible, with
absolutelv no effect on the com-
mittee. The boycott was unnec-
essary.”

In addition to Terry, Smith
and Mooty, the committee ‘con-
sists of President D. Grier Mar-
tin, Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts, professors Lewis B.
Schenck. Daniel D. Rhodes and
Donald B. Plott and senior Neill
McBryde.

Compulsory worship is as old
as Davidson itself. According to
Terry. church . attendance has
been required since the college
began, although the Vespers pro-
gram was not begun until. the
1930's: ‘I guess for the benefit
of the students."

At first, the cut syslem was
very limited—three or four a
year—but around 1960. the cuts
were increased to the present
level.

one goes deeper.

“When I was here (1950-54),
students complained, but I think
most of them really felt it was a
pretty good thing. Now the stu-
dents are more offended by it.
as well as more inconvenienced
by it.”

Smith said that, according to

a survey by Dr. Rhodes, ‘‘David- -

son is the only Presbyterian
school in the South that has any-
thing like Vespers.'’ He urged
any student “who wishes to wor-
ship voluntarily in the future”’ to
speak to his professors.

“It'll be the faculty that makes
the final decision,"’ said Smith.
“If the students will seek out
their professors, it could have
a very significant effect."

HARDIN CLAIMS SUCCESS
Terry Says Attendance
Up In Vespers Boycott

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

In spite of an attempted boy-
cott of Vesper’s Sunday, there
were 232 students at the service,
a number which Chaplain Will
Terry felt is “about average.”
In fact, he said,.it even sur-
passed slightly the previous
Sunday's attendance. '

Buzz Hardin, the leader of the
boycott movement, stated, how-
ever, that he felt-the movement
was a ‘‘qualified success.”

“The main purpose of the boy-
cott,"’ said Hardin, ‘‘was to give
the Davidson students, who are
known for their apathy, a chance
to translate their feelings about
compulsory worship into action.

“And it certainly accomplish-
ed this purpose. There was one
group of students which stayed
away to carry out the boycott
and another group which went to

Board Approves

Business Heads

Business managers for the

nullify the boycott. Thus the two
movements just balanced out.

“Although the Religious Life
Committee claimed that it had
no effect on their proposals, it
certainly had an effect on the
members of the committee.”
Hardin continued. ‘‘President D.
G. Martin, Dean Richard C.
Burts, Will Terry and several

student members were actively |

concerned about the threat of a
béycott.

Part of the movement was
apparently misunderstood by
many ‘students. We realized that
many of the students could not
afford a cut, so we encouraged
them to go to church in the
morning. We only wanted to
keep people away from the eve-
ning service, which-ijs the su-
preme expression of required
worship. |

“As I stated in the sheet which
was passed out to all the stu.
dents on Friday ‘night.’ he con-
tinued, ‘I believe that. this was
a ‘legal, moderate, and mature
way to express student opia
ion.’ Although -the numbers did
not turn out as well as we hoped,
the boycott did serve to drama-
tize students’ feelings about
compulsory worship.”

Murray Smith called the boy-
cott ‘unnecessary’ and felt that
“‘most reasonable students would

According to Mike Mooty,
“The movement was pretty in-

effectual, but the organizers
were acting in good faith and
out of a real desire to express
their feelings about required
worship. It was the most respon-
sible type of action the leaders
could have taken. It had no ef-
fect, however, on the considera-
tions of the Religious Life Com:
mittee.”

“It could have been a peace-
ful. harmless way of showing
student opinion,” stated Buck
Lawrimore, “but apparently it
didn't work out as well as the
leaders hoped it would.”

Staff Takeover
Brings Openings

With the changeover in
DAVIDSONIAN staffs
which will be taking place
after spring break, there
will be a number of open
positions on both the edi-
torial and business staffs.

avallable both on the re-
porting and copy desk staff.
Several positions for adver-
tising salesmen are avail-
able on the business staff.

ager Chris Hawk as soon as
possible.

Frolics To Boast Temptations, Coasters

The Temptations and the
Coasters will headline the Fri-
day night concert of Spring Frol-
ies April 15. Both groups will
present two shows.

The concerts will be held eith-
er in front of Chambers or in the
football stadium, according to
Vince Foster. newly elected
chairman of the Social Council.

Following the concert there
will be a movie in the Union and
a breakfast Saturday morning
from 2:30 till 4.

Saturday afternoon, if weath-
er permits, entertainment will
be at the Lake Campus, with a
hamburger supper that night.

“We're not sure about the Sat-
urday night concert yet.’’ con-
tinued Foster, **but it definitely
won't be rock n’ roll.”

Another movie will be shown
in the Union after the concert,
and plans are in the making for
some type of after-party in the
Union Saturday night, he added.
