Commons fights for its right for freshmen

By MATT HOUSTON

Self-discovery is a very trying
experience, a rite of passage for
every young man and woman in
America who goes to small, lib-
eral arts colleges .in North
Mecklenburg County. At this im-
portant time, the thoughts con-
cerning self-discovery are many
and varied. :

“Pistol Pete’ McIntyre, coun-
terman at the Commons, had
mixed feelings about the self-dis-
covery system. “Everyone wants
to get into an eating house, but
they eventually come to the Com-
mons. We get everybody at the
Commons. Trouble is, they. waste
a year maybe in one of them coed,
all-guys, all-girls, all-gay, all-ant,
I-don’t-know-what houses.”

Sandy Jablonski, head of cat-
ering at the Commons, felt that
self-discovery was a positive sys-
tem but that’ it needed some-
changes. “It puts so much pres-
sure on freshmen that I think is un-
wise. You're coming to college
for the first time, and in just six
months you have to make a very

important decision. Do you go
where all your friends are going,
the Commons, or do you take an
eating house which you know will
collapse and Jeave huge debts for
its members to\pay \off?”’
Carleton Pritchard, head of
the College Dining Service, had
more positive feelings about self-
discovery. “It’s fine, it’s excel-
lent, the Commons can live with it
perfectly. When ‘all the eating
houses on the court collapse, we’ll
always be here to serve the young
people.” :
Some people feel that the pre-
sent system provides too few
choices for freshmen or others
choosing a place to eat. Dean
Reed, class of ’99 and head of the
Union Cafe Interest Group, ex-
pressed these opinions about the
choices. “First you have all these
eating houses, and they’re all beg-
ging for members. But you know
Patterson Court is doomed. Then
you have the Commons. It’s like
you have to brownnose the cashier
just to get your meal card. What

I’ve found is that a lot of people

are tired of the snotty Commons
and want an alternative dining ser-
vice. Since the Union will move to
Johnston Gym when the new
sports complex is finished, the
present Union can be expanded to
serve a huge but cosy mob of stu-
dents. The Union Cafe can be an
alternative which is open to all,
unlike the Commons, and which
is sure to attract all kinds of
people.”

Mrs. Barber, head cook at the
Commons, had very simple senti-
ments about self-discovery. “I
cook, I clean. I can make a fine
meal. When we have that to offer,

who would self-discover the
Court?”
Martha Junkins, assistant

head at the Commons, felt that the
conflict between the Commons
and the eating houses had been
greatly exaggerated. “Naturally,

people at the eating houses fear

the Commons. The truth is that the
Court and the Dining Service can
complement each. other. Some
people will always want to be

abused during the spring term of .

their freshmen year, so they’ll al-
ways pick the fraternities. Other

people will want to avoid meats ~

and other fattening food, so
they’ll pick the women’s houses.
Still others will want the study
breaks offered by the coed eating
houses. That’s fine, since we only
offer study breaks during exam
week.”

Lee Tollentino, . purchasing
manager at the Commons, felt that
the” Commons was __ itself
threatened by self-discovery. “By
the time people self-discover,
they’ve already gotten bids. It’s
too late for us to get them. SoI say
we ought to give bids. This past
week, I-gave a few out just to try.
They took it!!! I tell them about
the social life. They never knew!!!
I tell them about the low cost.
They love it!!! We need bids.
Soon we get a national organiza-
tion too!!!”

Jay Kim, head of the Patterson

Court Council, felt that the situa-
tion of the Court was grim, but not
unsalvageable. “The Court can
survive if we pool all our re-

sources. For instance, we could
dissolve all the separate eating
houses into one organization. We
could compete with the Commons
in size, and obtain economies of
scale. Then each house would
serve one course or one entree,
and the students roam from place
to place during a meal. PAX could
handle dessert, SAE could deal
with the meat entree, Rusk could
handle salads, and so on. I’ve
asked the Economics Department
to explore the logistics.”

Lynda Daniels, editor of the
Announcement Sheet, gave the
benefit of her experience to this
reporter. “The main thing is for
freshmen to chill out. They should
relax and not let self-discovery
worry them. If they can’t get a
meal card this year, they can al-
ways enter the Commons at
another time. The rejection might
even be beneficial. Forced to eat
on the Court, they may like it there
and stay. More likely, they will
use their time outside of the Com-
mons to learn from peo fail-
