Homecoming

By LypiE WHITE

Staff Writer

Davidson celebrated a well-re-
ceived Homecoming this past week-
end, successfully bringing together
all manner of students present and
former.

Last Thursday’s SGA-sponsored
Patterson Court bonfire kicked off the
weekend’s festivities by honoring all
fall sports.

SGA president Katharine Hubbard
05 hoped that this would become a
new Davidson tradition.

“T thought the pep rally was ahuge
success,” she said.

“T think the bonfire helped to make
people aware of and excited about
Homecoming, and about fall sports
in general,” said Freshmen class

War in Iraq hits Davidson community close to home

Alumni, faculty share
personal realities
of war in Iraq

By Liz Barry
Staff Writer

While his charter plane bound for
Iraq refueled in Maine last Thursday,
second Lieutenant Keith Carmack
used his free time to make one last
phone call on American soil. Keith’s
two-minute conversation with his
wife was briefly interrupted when he
heard a friendly voice behind him call
out, “Hey, Big Guy!”

“We always call him ‘Big Guy’
because he is big, tall, and athletic,”
said Economics Departmental Assis-
tant Barbara Carmack, recounting
her son’s surprise.encounter. “When
Keith turned around, it was President
Bush sending off soldiers. That was
a real surprise.”

For Carmack and other members
of the Davidson community, the on-
going efforts to restore order and
democracy in a war-torn Iraq are
much more than distant struggles in
a far-off land. For many, the realities
of war have had profound personal
importance.

Barbara Carmack has worked in
the Economics department for 16
years and has been associated with
the college for over 30 years.

“T usually do very well,” she said

during an interview last Thursday, the
same morning her son left for Iraq.
“It’s just times like this when I’m
really focused on him leaving, that it

gets very hard.

Last week Keith joined B Com-
pany, 252 Armor Division, a U.S.
Army unit that has been in Iraq since
February.

Although Keith was not told where
in lraq he would be stationed, he told
family members prior to departure
that he would be joining ground
troops.

“It is disconcerting not knowing
where he is,” Carmack said. “But I
guess the good part is that if I knew
where he really was, I would be a
wreck. Maybe not knowing is bet-

Davidson’s tight-knit community
has helped Carmack deal with the
emotional stress of sending her son

off to war.

“T’ ve gotten a lot of support, espe-
cially here at work,” Carmack said.
“Many of my colleagues know my
family very well, so I’ve gotten a lot
of support through the faculty.”

The Office of Support Staff is com-
piling a box of useful items, ranging
from nutri-grain bars to magazines,
to send to Keith’s platoon during the
Christmas holidays.

Carmack has also set up a collec-
tion for Keith’s platoon in the staff
lounge. -

Carmack usually receives updates
from Keith’s wife, Shannon, who
Keith contacts directly by phone or
e-mail whenever possible.

Shannon lives in Raleigh with their

infant son.

“We have a very close family, and
that’s the only way you can get
through these things,” Carmack said.
“We try to stay strong for him. That’s
all we can do.”

Afghanistan and Iraq.

MECCA campaigns for Arabic professor

By ADAM MartTIN
News Editor

Eight hundred eighteen students
recently signed a petition in support
of hiring a full-time Arabic profes-
sor.

The new student organization
Middle-Eastern Cross Cultural As-
sociation (MECCA) began the
“Bring Classroom Arabic to
Davidson” campaign soon after its
inception this fall. -

The group will present its petition
and proposal to Dean of Faculty
Clark Ross and President Bobby Vagt
and then SGA next Thursday.

David Jemison, MECCA’s
founder and president, said “there is
an overwhelming demand for Ara-
bic at Davidson and in a post Sep-
tember 11 world and the onus is on
the academic institutions of the world
to meet this demand.”

Thirty-one students also signed a
different petition that said they would
be “willing to take classroom Arabic
here at Davidson if offered by an
Arabic professor.”

A handful of leading liberal arts
schools, such as Amherst, Williams,
Wellesley, Vassar, and Middlebury,
have hired full time tenure-track
Arabic professors.

President Bobby Vagt showed
general support for the idea.

“Tt is certainly,worthy of consid-
eration,” he said.

However, when asked about the
reality of bringing an Arabic profes-
sor to Davidson in the near future,
Vagt said “‘scarce resources require
you to make choices” and that “you
don’t pick courses because of imme-
diate popularity.”

Davidson currently offers Arabic
in its Self-Instructional Language
Program.

SILP allows only five students to
enroll in each of its two Arabic
