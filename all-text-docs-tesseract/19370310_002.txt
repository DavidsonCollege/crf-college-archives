ARTICLE IV; SECTION III... “No election
of an officer of any Student Body organization
shall be valid until a committee of three men
appointed thy the President of each respective
organization shall verify the votes cast.” It
is imperative that officials counting votes rec-
ognize this regulation of the Student Body

the terms are not
carried out, the count will be illegal.

TO COUGH OR NOT... Unnecessary ‘cough-
ing in chapel while a person is speaking at
times reaches the stage when the most timid
observer wants to express his indignation.
We at Davidson pride ourselves on being
gentlemen,

The primary requisite of a gentleman is
good-breeding ; and the primary proof of good
breeding is good manners. Certainly the spas-
modic outbursts of deliberate coughs are not
the fruits of good breeding, but on the other
hand, reflect the ill-manners of the cougher.
It is time the Student Body express their at-
titude against those few who would: belittle
the name of a Davidson gentleman, In a
forceful manner we ought to demand that —
when it is not necessary to cough, it is necessary
not to cough. :

‘A YOUNG MAN’S FANCY’ ... Rather un-
fortunate that after a Florida winter, our first
days of real spring coincide with the semes-
ter’s first set of reviews.

Make Davidson's Centennial Program a Success!

WE WONDER ... What the debaters from
Florida thought of our campus? Granted that
from size, furniture, and arrangement the lit-
erary society hallds the logical place to hold
a debate. But it looks like civie pride would
either restore these historic buildings to some
semblance of repair or take our visitors else-
where. From all appearances the ceiling of
Eu Hall was about ready to descend Monday
night, in case of rain umbrellas would have
been a wise precaution, broken seats, tattered
draperies, scattered heaps of dust, debris, and
plaster certainly did no credit to the South’s
best college. As pointed out before, the
society is helpless. H/on’t someone DO some-
thing about it?

WHILE ON THE SUBJECT... We'd like
to reiterate our plea for full time instructors
in speech and journalism. The |Davidson
sophomores gave a very creditable showing
under the circumstances, but the General
College team demonstrated clearly the ad-
vantages of full time professional coaching.
And we cauld go on for hours about the aid
a journalism professor could furnish to this
publication, An adequate command of Eng-
lish is certainly as vital as any other one part
of our curriculum,

A Fraternal Suggestion . .

One of the most absurd arguments which has
come to our notice in some months is the cam-
paign now being waged by The Daily Texan to
prevent the establishment of an R. O. T. C. unit

like nation,” “teaching our .youth to kill each

about “blind obedience,”

ete,, is being raked up,

Most of the arguments. of our blatant pacifists
searcely merit serious consideration. Instead of
“blind discipline fosters “intelligent

obedience,”

obedience”
instead of leading to war prepared-
ness is the surest means of preventing it — at
least total unpreparedness has never kept us out
of one. To our way of thinking a summer at Fort
McClellan would cure anyone’s desire for martial
glory. “It's not the War Department, but the
Peace Department, gentlemen!”

Peace On Earth...

Sometime ago this writer was collared, cor-
ralled and propelled much against his protesta-
tions into the boarding house of a fraternity of
which he is not a member, it being an off day
when the treasury could stand it and the fresh-
men needing a practical example of how one
Should not eat. It then occurred to him that a
plan providing. for the fraternities thus enter-
taining each other would be beneficial. Have a
“fraternity month” and on every Friday night of
that month have half the fraternity visit another
group and the other half receive visitors ac-
cordingly, The Pan-Hellenic Council could ar-
range the schedule.

Despite our democracy at Davidson, fraternity
tends to make us unnecessarily provincial. ‘This
plan, a social pleasure in itself, would greatly
alleviate the tendency.

Campus Comments

As has been reiteratéd many times, the trend
of chatter in this column has been an insurmount-
able string of protests and criticisms aimed at
anything and anybody whose shoulders seemed
to he able to bear up under them. Such will not
be my course, not for the reason that I am un-
able to muster any food for protest, or that it is
my desire to do my share to altér the trend—
neither of these, to be sure.

But it gives me no large degree of enthusiasm
for criticism, when I have but to look scarcely
three months into the future to anticipate the ap-
proach of a Centennial celebration for this insti-
tution, a thing wonderful in itself, but holding
much more in A
hundred years is a considerable period for any-

its significance for us today.

thing to last, but especially so when there are as
many things which can contribute to ruin and
downfall as are evident in the life of a college.
Then we certainly can't deny that there must be
a great deal of good, a great deal of wisdom in
the things upon which this existence was and has
been founded, the same things we all have found
joy in criticizing and to my knowledge, although
sincere, have offered no substantial, practical and
well-tried means for improvement.

[ do not say that nothing in the entire make-up
has need of Alteration, but it does seem that con-
sidering that lowly beginning and considering the
place of prestige, honor and vitality which the
name Davidson College holds today, that it is not
quite befitting the last graduating class of a hun-
dred years of graduating classes to attack the
bases of this most successful college, the ones
upon which she has come all the way. I may be

The success in college life which the principles
upor which Davidson College is built are con-
ducive to, those of honor, truth, obedience to
duty, and dentocracy, has no tangible evidence.
The means to these ends will grow obsolete and
will be réplaced in time, but the foundations are

Letters to the Editor

OBSERVE THE SABBATH
Dear Mr, Editor:

It is rare indeed that I am in-
clined to answer articles appear-
ing in The Davidsonian, but’ the
nature of Campus Comments last
week was such that I feel I am en-
tirely justified in
opinion.

expressing an
An opinion that I believe
is far more in acéord with the feel-
ings of the Davidson students than
those protests published last week.

Our fellow-student believes that
“not even the most ardent oppon-
ent could call this harmless recre-
ation (playing disturb-
ance of the peace” on Sunday. I beg
to inform him that, as Christians,
we do not refrain from this and
other similar activities on the Lord’s
Day, because they might disturb
the peace, but for the very import-
ant reason that Sunday is a day,
not part of a day, set aside for the
worship of Him who made all days
and who ordained that it should -be
for the honoring and glorifying of
His holy name.

Old fashioned, am 1? Then I
thank God that I am, however, I
can gladly say that my Sundays
spent thus are not stale and insipid
as my colleague seems to indicate
that his are, It is these who open
our theaters and other amusement
businesses on Sunday,

Davidson stands for the highest
Christian principles, and such com-
ments should not be allowed to go
out from Davidson to be read by its
friends and other colleges without
a vigorous denunciation.

Sincerely yours,

QUARTER SYSTEM
Dear Editor:

Thanks to the Scripts ’n Pranks
for bringing into mind the idea of
the quarter system. This bee has
buzzing in my bonnet ever
since the day that I returned from
those glorious holidays.

I must admit here that I don't
know-the-scholastic advantages of
having such a system, but it is one
that is being put more and more
into use. I also realize that the
whole system of courses would have
to be changed and mapped out
again, But that would give only
the administration a headache.

The results of the Scripts 'n
Pranks poll has not been announced
yet, but I believe that the quarter
system is desired by the majority
of the student body. If, the major-
ity are against it, all I have to say
is that they are pains in the neck
and don’t know what they want.

During my Xmas holidays, I be-
came green with envy when I
learned that several of my cohorts
had already had their exams and
were able to enjoy their holiday to
the best of their ability. (I won't
go into that part). While I had the
thought of exams hanging over my
head: during this time of festivity.
Their spring holidays come after
the second quarter exams.have been
finished, and some had as much as
a whole week! When I have a va-
cation, I think it would be nic¢ to
come back all refreshed and ready
for a new beginning.

HOW STILL YE LIE
Dear Editor:

been

During the last months Davidson

has been boasting about the many
fields in which it has’ pioneered,
but before we continue to take pride
in our progressive attitude I sug-
gest that we catch up with some
other institutions with regard
our Sunday blue Jaws.

to

While the modern Babylon indul-
ges in such sinful and indecent Sun-
day pastimes as tennis and golf a
small community in Mecklenburg
County still abides by the inhibi-
tions of another generation.

Oh, little town of Davidson, how
still we see thee lie—on Sundays!
During the spring several hundred
students will spend long afternoons
in “comparative boredom here. or
leave for a less repressive atmos-
phere. It's strange, but we aren't
all disposed to taking long walks or
reading helpful books.

The ruling on Sunday observance
reads as follows: On the /Sabbath
Day there shall be no games or
conduct of any sort inconsistent
with the proper keeping of the Sab-
bath. I have no quarrel with the
ruling but with the interpretation
which the administration feels
forced to use,

I think we have every right to
question the Pharisaical adherance
to the “mores” of fifty years ago.
Particularly is this true when stu-
dent opinion merely mirrors the
more géneral impression through-
out the country that Christ meant
what He said in the words “the
Sabbath was made for man, and not
man for the Sabbath,” and “judge
not, that ye be not judged.” Fifty
years in the future our ideas may
look as silly as bustles and beards
do today. We do not need to get
ahead of the times, but I plead that
we not stay behind the times.

CHANGING TIMES
Dear Editor:

I wish to concur with the writer
of Campus Comments and . the
sports editor for that excellent sug-
gestion in your last issue regarding
the. opening of golf and tennis
courts .on Sunday.

We feel sure that none of our
student body wotrld wish to be guil-
ty of Sabbath-breaking, and all of
us wish the first day of .the week
to remain a day set apart. We
would net countenance Sunday
movies or any other form of com-
mercialized amusement.

However, it seems to this writer
that ‘the issue here is different.
Since the time when, atthe close
of creation: “The Lord rested on
the seventh day ...” it has been
designated as, in the words, of the
old hymn, “day of rest and glad-
ness, day of all the week the best.”
I can scarcely see how the mild
sports above mentioned come under
the classification of work.

After a hard week’s work this
type of physical relief is often one
of most real forms of rest. While
tennis and golf may not exactly co-
incide with the orthodox concep-
tion of observance, I fail to see
where they can do more harm than
some of our more-than-secular
dormitory bull sessions or a bum-
ming tour of the surrounding coun-
try. Opening of the courts would
not force their use on those who
do not care for this type of recrea-
tion, but it would provide a more

Near the gate to the cemetery

The recent Scripts ’n Pranks poll
will probably reveal opinions of
students on existing conditions at
Davidson which appear to them
equally incongruous with times and
mores. The radical, or perhaps its
the progressive, and the con-
servative elements are in constant
conflict, This is a Good Thing,
maintaining a balance or elasticity
of perspective.

It is generally agreed by all and
sundry that there exists at David-
son an atmosphere, some call it a
spirit, an intangible, indefinable
something which few, if any, other
schools. possess. We have grown
up in this tradition. We take it for
granted. But it is a living ‘thing
which must be nurtured and main-
tained or it will. die.

When a man either forgets or
doesn’t know how to laugh at him-
self, he is lost. When a sculler rests
on his oars, forward motion ceases.
When a student body rests on the
traditions and achievements of the
Past, progress ceases and a lacka-
daisical stagnation is the result.
One hundred years of progress!
How far have we gone? How much
further are we going?

Christmas in the Fatherland—

Now that Germany is beginning
to exert an influence that must be
felt on the Davidson student body,
and sapping its number each year,
it seems high time that we paused
to consider the life that awaits
those of our number who answer
the call of the wild. Hence we
quote from a. letter recently re-
ceived in our midst, If members of
the upper classes can't guess the
identity of. the writer they didn’t
know him as well as most of us did:

“By Christmas my German was
passable. With a boy from New
York I was invited to visit an Am-
erican girl and her Swiss husband
in the Swiss Alps south of Zurick.
We swent two glorious weeks there
skiing every day and doing it up
in real fashion. After ripping down
from a mountain peak 1800 meters
high to the village at 800 meters in
an hour I figured I was the real
McCoy. We went over into Aus-
tria into the Tiroleon Alps with
the car for two days at ritzy St.
Anton — Bill (my pal) and Irma,
who is a honey of a girl and a good
sport. We paid 2 schillings apiece
and all slept in the same room in a
cow barn. The first day I tried
to ski the dangerous run
from St. Christoph at the tép of the
Arlberg to St. Anton far down on
the other side. Tried some fancy
turns and wrenched my left ankle
and knee at the same time. Had a
— — of a time during the painful
operation of taking my skis off and
hobbling to the road, about 200
meters away. Some English couple
picked me up there and we went
down to St. Anton on their sled,”

Speaking of the Speaking

For the sake of uniformity, and
also with a philanthropic eye to stu-
dent welfare, the Junior class has
decided, through its dance commit-
tee, to donate the masks which are
to be worn to the Friday night af-
fair. What more could’ you ask?
Melodies by Mellen, free masks,
and beautiful women. Only possible
hitch is that there might be some
awful shocks when the unmasking
takes place at intermission.

The faster reports on Mellen’s
music arrive, the .better the set
looks. We regret that he did not
originate rippling rhythm, however.
What a honey of a trade name
“Walter Mellen” would make for a
rippling rhythmaster!

Despite the numerous comments
it has excited in this press, the
lighting of the stage in. Chambers
auditorium is still terrible. When
plays are given the footlights make
it visible, but speakers are lost in
the shadows throughout their talks.
It is too bad that a building oth-
erwise so well equipped should have
a platform’ with as poor illumina-/
tion as was available in the gas-
light and kerosene (horse-and-
buggy, to you Democrats) days.
Maybe even worse. Suggestion to
the class of ’37: eliminate this fail-
ing with your class gift. The college
seems indisposed to correct it.
