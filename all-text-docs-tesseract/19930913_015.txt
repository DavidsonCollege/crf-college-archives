August in Italy: Men's basketball challenges the best of Europe

By Ed White

The Davidson men’s basket-
ball team got an early start to the
1993-1994 season when they took
a trip to Italy during August. The
team played seven games against
some of Europe’s best professional
teams.

Although the team finished
the tour with a record of 1-6, the
coaches felt that the trip was a
success. The European teams were
ofa higher caliber than most of the
teams on this season's schedule, so
the trip gave the team some expe-
rience that will be beneficial once
their season starts.

Most of the team returned to
Davidson on August 4, for a week
of practice. NCAA rules prohib-
ited freshmen from going on this
trip, so freshmen Mark Donnelly
and Ken May were not allowed to
participate. The team left for Milan,
Italy on August 12. Janko Narat
and Frantisek Babka, who were
both at home in Europe for the
summer, met the team in Italy. The
trip went at a frantic pace. For ten
days, the team traveled by bus from
the Adriatic Coast to the Italian
Alps.

The first game of the tour was
played in Morrovalle against the
Italian team Fabriano. The Wild-
cats lost the game by a score of 93-
76. Other teams they played in-
cluded some former NBA players.
Against Reggio Emilia, Davidson
played against ex-Houston Rocket
Mike Mitchell and ex-Seattle Su-
personic Tony Brown. The Cats
fell to Reggio Emilia by a score of
94-85, butsophomore Chris Alpert
played superbly with 19 points.
The highlight of the trip was
Davidson’s 87-86 win over Aris,
the second ranked professional
team in Greece. Narat scored with
two seconds left to seal the. Wild-
cats’ victory.

The trip was also a great cul-
tural experience for the team. All
the games were played at night, so
the team had most days for sight-
seeing. Many days, however, in-
cluded long bus rides. While trav-
eling, the team was able to take in
the scenery of central and northern
Italy. The team spent four days in
Bormio in the Italian Alps. Many
players enjoyed this city and its
scenery.

Horton, two of Davidson’s veter-
ans, made the trip but did not play
due to injuries.

Zimmerman had a stress frac-
ture and Horton is undergoing re-
habilitation for knee injury. Al-
though these two team leaders

could not play, Coach McKillop -

felt that the trip was a fantastic
experience for the entire team. He
said the trip was not only a good
opportunity by playing against top-
rated professional teams, but that it
was a good cultural experience.

McKillop added that, “the trip
was especially valuable for play-
ers like Mark McGuire, Quinn
Harwood, and Frantisek Babka, all
of whom had limited playing time
last year but might have key roles
this season.”

This year the team will have a
familiar face added to its coaching
staff. Recent graduate Matt
Matheny, a former football and
basketball player, will replace
Coach Simonds. Simonds returned
to St. Joseph’s in Maine where he

had coached previously. Coach
Shurina will move into Simonds’
position on the staff and Matheny
will take over at Shurina’s old po-
sition.

Now that classes have started,
the team continues to prepare for
this year’sseason. The team started
physical conditioning practices this
past Monday. Following NCAA
regulations, their first day of for-
mal practice will be November 1.
The team opens the season on
November 23.
