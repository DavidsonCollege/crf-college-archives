THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

(AU Unsianed Editorials by the Editor’y

Thanks To Mr. Martin
For Untiring Efforts

With every worthy project of im-
portance there are always many to
whom praise should be given. To sin-
gle out one or some is to do an in-
justice to others. Particularly do we
find this true of the new Patterson
Fraternity Court.

Yet the untiring work of one man
has drawn the particular attention of
all who have been connected with the
project. and not to single him out
would also be an injustice.

Therefore let us doff our hats to
Treasurer D Grier Martin, who has
been a continual planner. pusher and
director of the fraternity court.

His guiding influence played a
dominate role from the start when
his research revealed the economic
feasibility .o6f abandoning the old
court, and it has continued to do so
through the development stage with
extensive inquiry into the types of

«

feeding facilities. with the recommen-
dation of the ultimate site, and with
meetings in conjunction with the stu-
dents. faculty and trustees.

And even now, when the planning
is complete. his responsibility is far
from finished for the court is being
constructed by the college and hence
the burden of purchasing for the near-
ly half million dollar project falls on
the office of the treasurer.

From the standpoint of the user.
however, the greatest vote of thanks
should go for his untiring efforts to
meet in almost every incident their
own desires for the court. The aban-
doning of the duplexes and the mul-
titude of plan revisions are only two
cases in point. ;

So to one. who has labored long
and hard in the interest of an expand-
ed. modern fraternity system, we
speak our appreciation. —JRJ

Daily Tar Heel
Reprints Editorial

The Daily Tar Heel. student news-
paper of the University of North
Carolina, reprinted in its regular edi-
torial column the DAVIDSONIAN’S
editorial on President Eisenhower's
use of federal troops in Arkansas.

+ We would like to thank the Chapel
Hill editors for their respect for our
editorial opinion, particularly since
“the DAVIDSONIAN and The Daily Tar
Heel are not always of the same
opinion cn certain subjects.

The Daily Tar Heel is widely recog-
nized as an outstanding college news-
paper. While it is usually very liberal
in its philosophy, (they too elect a
new editor every year!) it is, never-
theless, a highly respected publica-
tion.

We of the DAVIDSONIAN hold
The Daily Tar Heel in high esteem
and respect its judgements even
though we do not always agree.

For the benefit of our readers, we
quote the following from the October
5th issue in which our editorial on
Arkansas was reprinted in full: ° . .
it is always admirable to see the
tenacity of states’ righters such as the
Davidsonian of Davidson College. As
an eulogy ‘to states righters. we sadly
reprint this excellent editorial.” The
editorial then continued with a re-
print of the DAVIDSONIAN’S (Sep-
tember 27) editorial entitled “Ike
Drives Another Nail in Coffin of
States’ Rights.”

We might add that this is not the
first time that The Daily Tar Heel
has reprinted our editorials. Last
Spring. it ran.our editorial on the
need for reforms in organized labor
unions, and also*the one on the high
Standards of Davidson’s honor svs-
tem.

The DAVIDSONIAN is honored to
be quoted in an outstanding newspa-
per such as Chapel Hill's student
daily.

R-A-D-I-O

Radio Free Davidson is back on
the air. The Davidson community is
now complete with this final addition
of a ‘radio station”.

Tuesday night’s “radio” audience
brought listeners stumbling from the
College Union, .took students away
from their studies in the library, and
even caused the DAVIDSONIAN of-
fices to close down so that we could
listen too.

Needless to say, Radio Free David-
son does hold the interest of its

EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
BUSINESS MANAGER
ASSISTANT EDITOR

listeners ~- something the ‘DAVID-
SONIAN tries to do to its readers.
Holding interest or not. we feel com-
pelled to repeat some advice that was
given last, year. That is. the operators
of R.F.D. must always be aware of
the responsibility they exercise in
broadcasting. A level sense of dis-
cretion and a respect for the reputa-
tion of the college will guarantee
R.F.D. a permanent place among the
“extras” of campus life.

And by the way, if the program
manager of R.F,D. cares to reveal

his identity. the DAVIDSONIAN will.

gladly give him an inch or two in the
paper to print his radio log.

Straight Talker
Leaves Capital

A man who is willing to call a
spade a spade is often hard to come
by these days. Even more difficult
to discover is a public official who
doesn't mind saying just exactly what
he thinks.

For the past four years and nine
months, just such a man has been
refreshing the muddled spirits of the
American public—a public that has
become accustomed to hearing the
traditional double-talk and buck pass-
ing from its national leaders.

Charles Erwin Wilson has been
the one figure, more than any other
person, who has made the mess in
Washington look not quite so messy.
His candid opinions and his genius
for efficiency might not have made
him the ‘smoothest’ {i.e. slipperiest)
man in the administration, but they
have certainly won for, him the ad-
miration of John Q_ Public.

Wednesday, Secretary of Defense
Wilson stepped out of the spotlight.
The man who said ‘‘what is gooel for
General Motors is good for the coun-
trv’ will now return to private life.

What this country needs is more
officials like Wilson— men who aren't
afraid- to offend powerful political
groups such as he did when he com-
pared workers to ambitious dogs and
“kennel-fed” dogs. or when he said
that the National Guard was a refuge
for draft dodgers during the Korean
War.

The American people have been
extremely fortunate to have one of
this country’s leading capitalists head
of our defense department.

We wonder whom the cartoonists
will turn to now.

Mumbo Jumbo, Inefficiency HauntPT Program

By NED AUSTELL
and LAURENS WALKER

During the past weeks the
Davidsonian halls of ivy have
rung with the infuriated cries
of students forced to take their
P.T. Tests for the second or

third times. Words. such as
“bureaucracy.” “red tape”, “in-
efficiency", and others less

printable have been called forth
by the misplacement of records
and seeming mumbo jumbo of
the Athletic Department.

To find out the why and
the wherefore of this situ-
ation which has caused so
many men to flavor their
coffee with profanity in
the past weeks, we went
to the heart of the prob-

“NO COMMENT”

lem, the Gym and Dr. Tom
Scott, Athletic Director.

Dr.. Scott frankly admitted
that he knew many students
were disturbed by the fact that
mistakes have been made in
the recording of absences and
test results.

ONLY HUMAN

Mistakes and_ inaccuracies
may: occur in any department,
and the PT Department is no
exception. “‘We are only human,
and errors are entirely possi-
ble. We are not trying to be
difficult, and would like to
straighten out any and all mis-
takes.”

The present PT program was
begun three years ago, when

the present senior class was
rising to its sophomore year.
Prior to this time, all Davidson
students were required to take
four full years of physical in-
struction.

When the course was changed
to a required two years, a
standard physical training test
was inaugurated that had to
be passed before any student
might consider himself as hav-
ing completed his requirement.

SECOND TEST

Evidently, much of the con-
fusion concerning the test has
been caused by this change in
program. Seniors found them-
selves in the situation of hav-
ing to take a second test be-

Curriculum Group Silent

By LARRY MEYER

Members of the faculty com-
mittee on the curriculum chose,

for the most part. to remain si-:

jent when approached earlier
this week about. their views on

curricular modifications. Five
of the six members of the com-

mittee were interviewed. Dr.
Pietenpol. the chairman. was
not available for comment.

since he was attending a con-
vention in New York City.

FLAT REFUSALS

Of the five interviewed, three
flatly refused to offer any com-
ment one way or the other. They
cited Dr. Pietenpol'’s absence as
their reason for not wanting to
commit themselves.

ry

READER’S OPINION

The results of the interviews
are as foltows:

Professor Abernethy. philoso
phy, no comment.

Professor Bevan. psychology
no. comment.

Professor Watts, French, no
comment.

Professor Logan. chemistry:

Q, “What is your opinion of
a general science course on the
order of a survey of several
branches of science?”

A. “I am not, frankly. in fa-
vor of a general science course.
Each field of science is in itself
too large to incorporaté into a
survey. I see no more reason

for surveying several branches
of science than for lumping all
modern languages together in
a one-year course or incorporat-
ing history and science

into

some similar type of polyglot.’

BIBLE REQUIREMENTS
Professor Lilly, English:

Q. “How. do you stand on the
proposed changes in the Bible
requirements?”

A. “Since that is not my de-
partment, I do not feel that
tam in a position to answer
that. The committee is anxious,
however, to improve the: curri-
culum.”

Q. “Then you do believe the
curriculum could bear improve-
ment?”

A. “Yes. Professians and busi-
ness change, and we should cer-
tainly keep abreast of the times.
The committee members do not
wish to take a reactionary stand,
but neither do we want to be
radical.":

Court, Integration Praised

+ Dear Editor:

I would like to congratulate
the Court of Control for the
fine work. that’ it is carrying on
in disciplining the freshmen.
The Court jis a useful and time.
tested organization on the Da-
vidson campus. A disciplinary
body is necessary to make the
freshman class respect and obey
the regulations set down for
their behavior.

PUNISH VIOLATORS

Freshmen who willingly vio-
late these regulations should be
subjected to the punishment of
the court and the general con-
demnation of the student body.
Without the co-operation and
support of the upperclassmen,
the good of the court is de
feated.

Using the court as a means
to provide entertainment and

PEANUTS

amusement for upperclassmen
is to destroy the constructive
purpose. of it.

JEERING STUDENTS

If students would stop to
think of the effect that the
scorn of 850 jeering fellow-
Students could have on a boy
they would be more careful in
condemning boys to  punish-
ment.

By placing themselves in a
similar position I believe they
would realize a terrible lack of
consideration for an__ indivi-
dual’s personal feelings.

VERNON ANDERSON

Dear Editor:

The 14th Amendment says,
“All persons born or naturalized
in the United States” must be

granted the same rights. Since
no. specific condition. such as
race, sex, or religion is men-
tion. we must aceept it at its
face value and apply it to all
persons.

MINOR DIFFERENCES

Naturally, girls being persons,
they are of course to be in-
cluded in all the recent deci-
sions designed to promote equal-
ity.

LOVE AND FAIRNESS

Let us all take our stand in
the ranks of justice and greet
this situation with love in our
hearts and the principle of fair-
ness uppermost in our minds.
Not sometime in the distant fu-
ture! No! .. . Arise to this
cause, you lovers of human
tights, and let us do it now!

ED SPIVEY

cause of the new program.

However, it is hard to be-
lieve that all of the confus-
ion concerning the test
could have come from the
changed program. Some
favit doubtiess lies with
the Athletic Department
for the careless handling of
records and mistakes in re-
cording test scores. These
errors can cause a man to
take an underserved § se-
mester of physical training.

After talking to Dr. Scott. we
have every reason to believe
that the department is doing
its best to correct the situations
that have led to the errors. He
commented that most students

have been very understanding

and co-operative in completing
their PT record.

’

REVAMPED PROGRAM

The entire program is to be
revamped to provide a varied
program of activities. These will
include soccer, wrestling, bas-
ketball. gymnastics, tumbling.
swimming. golf, handball, tram-
poline, and softball.

The development of the
body deserves a place in
the liberal arts program,
but this place does not ab-
solve the Athletic Depart-
ment from running its af-
fairs in an orderly and ef-
ficient manner.

At least, the liniment should
be free after the third PT test.

SCHROEDER

Boginning with this issue, the DAVIDSONIAN wil carry
Schulz’s “Peanuts.” Davidsonians will be able to enioy this comic
strip weekly through special permission granted by the Char.
totte Observer, holder of exclusive rights to “Peanuts” in this
area. Readers of the DAVIDSONIAN can follow “Peanuts” daily
on the comic page of the Observer.

ON CAMPUS

Hamer Heads Army

By PHIL LEWIS

Several of us were really disappointed at being
omitted from the interesting list on the “Official Wood-
row Wilson Bulletin Board”, but we swallow our pride
and extend heartiest congratulations to Bob Jones, Peter
Powell, and their jolly crew.

Marshall Sasser was one of the outstanding partici-
pants in last Thursday's activities. The container he used
was relatively small, but, speaking from experience, we
know that that ice cold water more than made up for the
lack of volume. To the boys from Belch who used warm
water, let us say “Thanks, fellows!!”’

We hear Brown Hamer is heading up the under-
ground Peon Army this year. Their motto is similar to
the U. S. Infantry’s ‘Follow Me.” Peon watchword: “I'm

Right Behind You.”

Mr. Martin commented in the Snack Bar this week
that Dr. Woods is recuperating quite satisfactorily, as
far as can be determined at this time. Our continued

best wishes, Doc.

We'd like to know why good old Alfred E. Neuman
was passed over for this Charlie Brown come-lately?
Seriously, we’re glad to have you, Brown.

When in doubt. ...

COFFEE BREAK

Homogenized
Or Pasteurized?

BY BOB JONES

_ Now, more than ever, the
“Big Five” (Va.. N. C,, S. C.. Ga.
and Fla.) are providing most
of Davidson's students. An awe:
some ninety per cent of the
Freshmen are from _ these
states. .

\* could probably be point-
ed out also that ninety per cent
are rather conservative, Pro-
testant, white, anti-labor, and
are from families whose in-
come types them as middle
elass.

STERILITY

This concentration certainly
contributes to homogencous
student body of fine Davidson
gentlemen. This also contributes
to the sterility (mental not phy-
sical) of these gentlemen.

The examination of conflict.
ing ideas is essential to a liber.
al education. Until one is ex.
posed to rival positions and has
a reasonable basis for his own
his liberal education is not com-
plete.

COMPETITIVE EXCHANGE

Education of this type, how.
ever, does not arise from class.

By Charles M. Schulz

room knowledge. It comes from
an active, competitive exchange.
of ideas with fellow classmates.
Many Davidson students arc
competent to discuss rival
philosophies of life: however,
no one really seriously consid-
ers “these to be sensible.

If a student comes to David-
son with a significantly differ-
ent slant on life he is ostracized
to such a degree that if he
sticks it out for a full year.
one can be sure he won't be
back for a second. Of course
he always has the alternative of
conforming to the hallowed Da-
vidson pattern and becoming
“well adjusted.”

NO IMMUNITY

Wt is difficult to determine
where the basis for this situa-
tion rests. The student body
perpetuates it, but then the
faculty and administration don't
seem immune either. ,

Last year a member of the
administration somewhat  tri-
umphantly announced in chapel
that he could tell the alumni
with pride that Davidson had
a completely homogeneous stu-
dent body and was turning out
the very same type of gentle-
man that has been its tradition
through the years. This alarm-
ing statement was accepted by
the audience with astonishing
calmness.

DEFEATED BANNER
Whatever else may be said
for this avowed product of Da-
vidson, it is certain that it de-
feats a liberal education—the
banner which Davidson ostensi-
bly carries.
