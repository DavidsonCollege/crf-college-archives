USC-Alabama tops agenda

By PAUL BANTA
Sports Columnist

For the first time in a
number of years, this week-
end’s Texas-Oklahoma game
is not dominating the college
football world.

Instead of watching the
Sooners. and Longhorns
square off in Dallas, fans
across the nation will have to
settle for the equally impres-
sive, but not traditional,
match-up of Southern Cal-Al-
abama.

Along with Southern Cal—
Notre Dame, the Texas-Okla-
homa clash is at the top of the
annual interconference games.

The outcome of this game
has had as much bearing on
the national championship as
the late season showdowns
between Oklahoma-Nebraska,
Ohio State-Michigan, USC-
UCLA, and, not so long ago,
Alabama-Auburn. With both
teams undefeated and highly
rated, it should be no different
this year.

So why is this game not
attracting the attention it has
in the past?

Because in the past few
years, it has turned from being
a fall classic into an intensely
bitter face-off. The supporters
of both schools have labelled
the game as “must-win” and
the coaches have only encour-
aged and promoted this idea

_ with their actions.

Oklahoma fans, even in the
midst of a long winning
streak, would boo coach Barry
Switzer if his team didn’t win
by a large margin, and Texas
rooters would forget the 10
win ‘seasons and the many
Southwest Conference titles as
long as Darrell Royal’s Long-
horns were unable to top the
Sooners.

Last year it all came to a
climax. The year-round com-
petition— many a blue-chip
Texan schoolboy narrows his
choice of colleges to these
two— became too much for the
coaches and erupted into one
of the dirtiest name-calling
sessions in college football
history.

Charges and counter-char-
ges of spying on practices were
top sports news before the last
showdown. Royal, one of col-
lege football’s saints, overre-
acted to the charges of Switzer
thus allowing the situation
and the game to develop into
nothing more than a grudge
match.

This episode was one of the
things that led the Texas
mentor to decide later in the
season that football was no
longer fun for him and that he
would retire from coaching.

The nasty scene of last year
turned many a college football
fan off and so this week's
game is in effect on probation.

Hopefully, Switzer has seen
that name-calling only hurts
both of the schools and new
Texas coach Freddy Akers, an
old teammate of Switzer’s at
Arkansas in the late fifties,
will not let the pressure of the
fans cause the purpose of the
game to get out of focus again.

Grid Notes— During all the
upsets early in the 1976 sea-
son, coaches at the traditional
football powers kept saying
the 30-scholarship limit was
making all the teams equal
and would end the days of a
select elite dominating college
football.

It may have seemed that
way last year, but anyone who
looked at this week’s Associa-
ted Press poll would never
know it. The top ten this week
is no more than a list of the top
powers of the last fifteen
years. With Southern Cal on
top followed by Oklahoma,
Michigan, Ohio State, Texas,
Colorado, Alabama, Arkan-
sas, Nebraska, and Penn
State, the only team missing
from this group is Notre
Dame, and they are 11th.

* Speaking of Notre Dame,
the Irish, despite Dan Devine,

“might be on the verge of

becoming as good a team as
their talent.

The Irish have finally found
a quarterback to get their
offense going. Veteran Joe
Montana, who missed last
season with a shoulder separa-
tion, came off the bench two
weeks ago against Purdue
with Notre Dame trailing.

Under his leadership, the
Irish scored 17 fourth quarter
points to win. Last week, he
took them all the way in
beating Michigan State.

North Carolina fans might
remember Montana as the one
who sparked Notre Dame’s
comeback victory over the
Tarheels in 1975.
