THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, OCTOBER A 1994 ‘ 11

Rethinkin:

by Jacob Abraham

As an aficionado of rock mu- ©
sic and a regular reader of the Arts
section, I was largely disappointed
by Jim Moss’s sloppy and unin-
spired summary of the “Best Rock
albums ever” in the October 3 is-
sue of The Davidsonian. Mr.
Moss’s article reflects not only a
poor knowledge of rock and roll
history but also a poor degree of
journalistic professionalism and
objectivity. While most criticism
of such popular music contains an
inevitable element of personal bias
and subjectivity, certain points
made by Mr. Moss seem implau-
sible even to a casual listener of
rock music like myself. I would

simply like to point out some of the
glaring fallacies in Mr. Moss’s ar-
ticle, in the order of the albums he
listed.

(1) Sgt. Pepper’s: The fact that
Mr. Moss admits that the Beatles
appear on his list only “grudg-
ingly” immediately reveals a lack
of objectivity in musical criticism.
Polls of professional music critics
have consistently rated Sgt.
Pepper’s as the greatest rock al-
bum of all time. The fact that Jimi
Hendrix, perhaps the greatest gui-
tar virtuoso in rock music, covered
the title track the same week it was
released only attests to the album’s
significance. Either directly or in-

directly, the Beatles managed to
influence practically every major
rock group that followed them. -
(2) Dark Side of the Moon: While
this album’s influence on the pro-
duction standards of rock albums
may be significant; the statement
that Dark Side contains “some of
the best lyrical writing ever” is
questionable. Pink Floyd’s lyrics
are nothing to scoff at, but they
would surely face serious compe-
tition from the works of Bob Dylan
or Lennon and McCartney, among
many others.

(3) Synchronicity: Mr. Moss’s
claim that the Police popularized
“minimalism” in rock and roll is a

hopelessly ambiguous and unsup-
ported statement. How many other
artists that predate the Police could
qualify as minimalists, including
the Velvet Underground and the
Beatles? And how often has the
Police’s characteristic blend of
early Eighties pop rock and reggae
elements influenced other bands
outside the hopelessly derivative
pop genre itself?

(4) Led Zeppelin II and (5) Houses
of the Holy: Finally, a band ap-
pears on the list willingly (as op-
posed to “grudgingly”) whose in-
fluence cannot be questioned. Mr.
Moss correctly mentions that Zep-
- pelin played a primary role in fa-

g the "Greatest Rock Albums Ever"

thering whole genres of ck mu-
sic, including heavy metal and
punk. However, he offers little
support for his claim that Houses
of the Holy is “definitely Zeppelin’s
peak performance”—a distinction
frequently attributed to any num-
ber of their other albums by both
critics and fans.

‘(6) Appetite for Destruction; Here
the list completely disintegrates
into biased and insupportable
drivel. Mr. Moss insightfully la-
bels this album as “‘the number one
kick-butt albura ever released’’.. . .
I’m sure that Beavis vn Butthead

Coffeehouse:

a new forum for

artistic expression

By Shayna Chazin

Forall youprinces and queens
of the night out there, Davidson
finally has created a place where
you can prop up your feet, fill up
your mug with a fine brewed cup
of joe, and listen to the sounds of
some interesting voices. Every
other Thursday night, around 9:30-
12:30 a.m. at the Outpost, we‘ve
got ourselves a coffeehouse.

It all started last year when
senior Sheri Abdalaaty founded
the Saturday coffeehouses with the
help of a loyal group of volunteers.

Since’ then, therehave been jam’|’

sessions, poetry readings, cool
breezes, anda laid back atmosphere
well-fitted to balance out the ten-
sion of our schoolwork.

This Thursday, come hear a
mix of poetry and fiction readings
by some of our budding writers—

Mexican-American storyteller Olga Loya to perform Saturday.

Alex Crumbley, Rachel Newcomb,
Katie Rogers, Holt Vaughan,
Shayna Chazin, and Melissa
Federoff. There will be an open
mic afterwards, so if you‘re not
sure whether or not you‘d like to
read your back-of-a-paper-napkin
poetic revelations, bring some of
your stuff and decide while you ‘re
there. The finest of snack-ums will
accompany your tea or coffee, and
a donation of some change or a
dollar or two will be appreciated
by the Coffeéhouse committee to
support further culture-quenchers.
Hope to see you there, my friends.

‘The movie is amazingly in-
tense, yet amazingly funny, which
is a potent combination. New sto-
ries and new characters keep crop-
ping up in the second and third
hours which keeps Tarantino’s tour
de force fresh. For two and a half
hours, I was taken on aride that felt
like an adrenaline shot to the heart,
and I loved every minute of it. My
only advice is “See the movie, see
Uma Thurman, and see the most

original filmwork and storyline in
ages.” And DO NOT take your
grandma unless she has a strong
heart.

-cil, an organization that promotes

tion and S.E.R.C.H., will sponsor
aprogramentitled “Ghosts, Power,

volves a Latin American

~ storytelling lecture/discussion/per-

formance by two women, Olga
Loya and Marjorie Agosin.

Olga Loya is a Mexican-
American storyteller whose skills
include teaching and performing.
She gives classes and workshops
in both the United States and Latin
America. Loya declares, “I like to

tell stories because they have a
way of entertaining, teaching, and
giving people strength. Through
stories, people see how other people
live, how they think, and how they
could live. Stories are good for the

. mind and the heart.” A brochure

about Loya describes that “‘a rich
tapestry of oral literature is woven
by Olga Loya from traditional and
original tales and family and per-
sonal histories.” Loya’s presenta-
tion entitled “Love and Ghosts:
Stories from South of the Border”
proves to be entertaining for all.
Marjorie Agosin is a Chilean
writer and literary critic who has
written.on subjects such as Latin
American women writers and cen-
sorship and ‘has recently read her
poetry ata United Nations meeting
representing the Latin American
voice. Her portion of the program
