Junior Anthony Foxx

Travels to South Africa

By Kim Munsterman

Junior Anthony Foxx flips
through his slides of his visit to
South Africa this summer. Among
picturesque scenes of Capetown
and its surrounding mountains, the
blue water of the coast, and busy
Johannesburg, Foxx also shares
slides of crowded shanty towns
without plumbing or electricity,
and pictures of children of a black
township playing around a mas-
sive garbage pile. It is this vast
disparity between white and black
areas that left a dramatic impres-
sion on Foxx.

“People ask me how my trip to
South Africa was andI don’tknow
what to say; it was good and bad,
beautiful and ugly,” reflects Foxx.

Foxx had been hoping to visit
South Africa for some time; this
summer, only days after U. S.
sanctions were lifted, Foxx left for
Johannesburg, accompanied by a
classmate’s father who works for
the National Institute for Trial
Advocacy.

South African lawyers to teach
them better trial skills,” Foxx
explains,

Foxx arrived in South Africa
notknowing exactly what he would
be doing, but found work with the
Black Lawyer Association. Over
the course of his four week stay, he
edited the South African Law
Review, while studying the legal
system there. Living with the ex-
ecutive director of the Black Law-
yer Association in Kew, a pre-
dominantly white suburb of Johan-
nesburg, Foxx states that he “didn’t
getthe black township experience.”

Yet Foxx recalls his drive to
and from work everyday and the
vans he saw “filled with black
people certainly beyond acapacity
legal in the U. S. These were taxis
taking people to work; I was sad to
realize that not only can these
people not afford cars, but they are
only provided with minimal stan-
dards of transportation.”

Foxx was also affected by his
visit to Crossroads, “‘a part of a
township in Capetown were the

poorest of the poor live.” His slide
shows an area where homes re-
main submerged in flood waters
during the rainy season and where
firesare litin the streets for warmth.

“This is a designated area for black ;

people and the economic reality is

that they can’t afford to leave,” he

explains.

Reflecting on his experience, — =

Foxx comments, “Asan American
and after seeing what I saw, I
wanted to know how the nation I
live in could bea player in this. As
a student, I felt I was in the 60’s
because of the ideas being kicked
around and the sense of purpose
everyone has. It was great to see
liberation in its genesis.” Adds
Foxx, “As a human being, I felt
very sad, secing how people treat
one another. And as a black per-
son, I felthopeful because in every
conversation I had the subject was
apartheid. Students, lawyers, --
everyone was talking about it.
Black people havea sense of unity
in that they are all trying to liberate
themselves. That’s hopeful.”

is Elox, Anyway?

By David Smyth
The first landmark that greets
visitors and new students on a visit
to Davidson is not anything col-
lege-owned or operated; itis a sign
that reads ““ELOX: An Agie Group
Company.”

Thousands; of Davidsonians
have driven by this seemingly
innocuous sign for years without
knowing exactly what went on
behind the red brick exterior.

Today the mystery behind the
sign stands exposed. The Elox
Corporation, says Product Man-
ager Glenn Coggins, manufactures
electronic discharge machines, or
EDM’s. In layman’s terms this
means that they drill amazingly
intricate shapesand holes into metal
with electronic., particles, thus
avoiding touching the final prod-
uct.
The aerospace and medical in-
dustries use these machines to
produce, among other things, hear-
ing implants with tiny apertures
for sound intake and threads.
These EDM’s also make rubber
molds for shoe soles and wire sig-
nificantly thinner than human hair.
So you can likely attribute the
springy comfortof your brandnew
$200 Nike running shoes to a shoe
mold produced by an Elox ma-

chine.

Elox was born in 1943 when
it bought out a similar business in
Detroit and set up shop in Troy,
Michigan. The Davidson office
was opened in 1961, employing
fifteen people and spanning 18,000
square feet, At the time, Ford,
General Electric, and General
Motors were their largest custom-
ers.

In 1970, the Troy office closed
up and moved the whole shebang
to. Davidson, doubling the ware-
house space to 36,000 square feet
and also adding 12,000 feet of
office area. Agie USA Ltd. bought
out Elox in 1988 and it stands as a °
gleaming shrine to corporate
America today. -

When approached about this

_ Story, Mr. Coggins joked, “Well,

most of our spouses don’t know
exactly what we do here.” The
front desk secretary concurred,
adding, “I’ve heard that we work
for the government, that we’re
spies...”

Meanwhile, they keep produc-
ing and testing their electronic
drills, doing applications research
to keep with industry demands,
and scaring little kids that make
funny faces up against their win-
dows.

On Beanies, Freshmen,

And Codes of Days Past

“Do you still have to say hello
to everyone you pass by?”

“I’m sorry?”

“You know. That rule. You
have to greeteveryone and tip your
hats to professors.”

“I’m sorry, sir, I’m not sure
what you are talking about.”

“And the beanies. Tell me they
still wear those beanies.”

“Bean-what?”

He stopped. He stared at my
bare head and my purple hightops
that squashed the green grass,

“Son,” he cocked an eye to-
wards me, “Are you from Davidson
College?”

Not from the Davidson Col-

» If,as Dr. Thomas and Thomas

Hardy suggest, suffering builds a
moral Conscience, then the fresh-
men before the class of 1971 were
tortured into fine gentlemen. In
their student handbook the fresh-
men found a list of rules patterned
after the ten commandments with
a few more thou shalt nots tacked
on. When they arrived on campus,
some freshmen classes received a
poster kindly reminding them of
the rules they were to follow. _
Furthermore, in 1923 the stu-
dents created a Court of Control.to

Student body the spirit of the true

of 1954-5). Any violations of the
