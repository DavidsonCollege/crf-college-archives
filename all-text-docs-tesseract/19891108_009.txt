Men’s soccer
smashes Wofford

Avenges football's loss with an 8-0
vitory; ends with 8-11-1 record

By CARTER PAYNE
Davidson 8 - Wofford 0

Playing at home last Tues-
day, Davidson smashed a hap-
less Wofford team 8-0. The
impressive aspect of the game
is that the Wildcats could easily
have become complacent and
reduced their play to the level
of their lesser opponent, but
they did not. Instead they kept
up the intensity for the entire
first half.

That was more than
enough time to secure the win.

Rob Ukrop started off the
rout when he blasted the ball
past the Terriers’ goalkeeper
for the first of his two goals.
Ukrop’s goal was followed by
scores from freshman Lance
Kinerk and senior Tracy Hank-
ins. Both scores were head-ins.

The first half scoring festi-
val continued with senior Rob
Vest and. freshman Glenn
Smith scoring in succession to
make 5-0. Ukrop then added
his second goal of the contest
just before halftime.

In the second half Vest was.
able to get his} second goal’of*
the game to give the Wildcats a
7-0.advantage. Later in the half
senior Robert Avinger snared
his first goal-of the season in a
nicely aimed penalty kick for
the final Davidson score.

Because of the offensive

onslaught the Wildcat defense -

did not see much action. But
when the ball somehow man-
aged to find its way into Wild-
cat territory, defenders Cliff
Castelloe, Lance Long and sen-
ior Ross Saldarini combined to
quickly send it in the other di-
rection.

Coach Charlie Slagle was
able to substitute liberally
throughout the latter part of
the game, and everyone on the
team contributed to the vic-

tory.

Liberty 1- Davidson 0

Thursday the Wildcats
played their second home
game of the week. It wasa cold,
wet afternoon that caused in-
adequate field conditions and a
low scoring game.

For the first part of the.

game, Davidson managed. to
keep the ball at the Liberty end
of the field with rugged defen-
sive play by Scott Poisson,
Lance Long and Ross Saldarini,
while Tracy Hankins and Pete
Cobb played aggressively on

shots on goal by the ‘Cats were
way Off the mark due mainly to
poor footing on the playing
field.

At the 16:04 mark, as a re-
sult of a Davidson violation,
Liberty was awarded a direct

Rob Ukrop, #6, gave it his all along with the rest of the soccer team last week in a match against Liberty.

Although the Wildcats lost by 0-1, aggresive defense tactics kept Liberty dawn to that one goal. The

team finished with a 8-11-1 record.

‘kick which rocketed past a

diving Scott Zucker for what
was to be the lone score of the
game.

The second half resembled |

a football game, with
multiple collisions between
players from both teams.
Davidson had several opportu-
nities to poke the ball in on
corner kicks, buf failed to capi-
talize. As the final minutes of
the game ticked away
Davidson managed to keep the
ball at the Liberty end of the
field, but they could not elude
Liberty’s extremely quick de-
fense when the ball gotin close.

Liberty hung on to win with
several excellent saves by the
goal keeper.

The soccer team finished
the season on a sour note Sun-
day afternoon, losing at Char-
leston 3-0.

and seemed to stay that way.

uphill battle from that pointon.

Charleston scored again a few
minutes before halftime to in-
crease their lead to 2-0.

Davidson continued to
play flat in the second half,
perhaps still weary from the
seven-hour ride to Charleston.
Inany case, the Wildcats failed
to score and allowed Char-
leston one last goal toward the
end of the game.

The ‘Cats would have
liked to have ended the season
ona higher note, but they were
unable to get on track from the
onset of the contest. Davidson
finishes the season with an 8-
11-1 record. ‘

Another large step for Davidson: Trustees
approve scholarships for women’s sports

Reprinted from The Campus Chronicle
Davidson’s Board of Trustees voted
at the October meeting to begin provid-
ing athletic scholarships to women in
proportion to those offered tomen. The
equivalent of nine full scholarships for
women will be phased in during the
next three years. The decision includes
the possibility of spreading the money
among several sports and offering par-
tial scholarships to more than nine
women. “a :
Sterling Martin, acting director of
athletics, said thatnumber was decided

upon based on the fact that Davidson —

offers 15 scholarships to men (all are
used for basketball) and that participa-
tion in intercollegiate athletics is 66
percent male and 34 percent female.
Martin said the trustees took action
based on the recommendation of its

committee on athletic policy, which is.

chaired by W. Olin Nisbett II, president
of Sterling Capital Management in
Charlotte. Martin said the move was
made to help Davidson come into com-
pliance with federal Title IX require-
ments, which state that men’s and

women’s sports must receive propor- -.

tional resources in college budgets.
Though the scholarships have now

been approved, no decision has been
made on how they will be allocated
among Davidson’s seven women’s
teams-cross country, field: hockey, in-
door track, outdoor track, soccer, tennis
and volleyball. Martin said the decision
would be made in consultation with

women’s sports coaches, the presiden-

tial advisory council on athletics and
trustees.

Martin said division of the scholar-
ships hinges on several considerations-
- possible conference affiliation, the im-
pact scholarships may have on any
single sport and the wishes of the
coaches. He added that “there is not
unanimity among the coaches on the
best way to do this.”

Betsy Pryor, field hockey coach,
said the matter of conference affiliation
is the driving factor. “If we get in a
conference that requires us to play
women’s basketball, it would. make
sense to showcase it and put all our
scholarships there,” she said.

But Martin admitted no decision on
conference affiliation seems imminent:

r said that fact forces another deci-
gion. She said, “Then the administration
has to decide whether to showcase one
sport or split up scholarships between

several, and that’s not a coaches’ deci-
sion.”

She said she would like to have
some scholarships for field hockey to
attract top-quality specialty players,
such as a goalkeeper, who could be a
significant asset to the team. Butevenall
ninescholarships in field hockey would
not create a nationally competitive
team, she cautioned, because of
Davidson's stiff admissions require-
ments. As with men’s basketball, some
of the top players in the sport could not
make it as Davidson students.

Diane Boettcher, soccer coach, said
scholarships would be of little value to
her program. “In a sport as large as
soccer, with 21 team members, one or
two scholarships are not going to be a
great benefit. We're competing against
the top Division I teams in country for
players, and they're full scholarship
teams. I’d need more than just a few
scholarships to compete effectively.”

’ Boettcher thinks it wiser for the

college toconcentratewomen’sscholar- ~

ships in one showcase sport, as is done
with men’s basketball. But she cau-
tioned that scholarships in a showcase
sport must be supplemented with extra
support staff and resources for that

team to make it a winner.

On the other hand, track and cross-
country coach Gary Andrew said he
would welcome scholarships for those

“It would greatly improve our pro-
gram, particularly with cross-country
where you only need five runners,” he
said.

Andrew said students who were
academically qualified and athletically
gifted had been enticed by scholarships
to enroll elsewhere when he could not
make a similar offer. “I would welcome
the opportunity to have scholarships to
offer to an athlete,” he said.

Caroline Price, women’s tennis
coach, expressed mixed emotions about
the decision, but says she’s leaning to-
ward distribution of scholarships
among several teams if they are not
needed for a new women’s basketball
team. “Certainly even two scholarships
would make a difference in women’s
tennis,” she said.

Price noted that Davidson's team
played even with Furman from 1981
until 1986, when Furman began giving
