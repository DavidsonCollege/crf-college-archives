Folk singer John Prine to
highlight Mid Winters

By JEFF HERRIN
Staff Correspondent

This year's Mid Winters con-
cert will feature John Prine, an
accomplished but little known
folk-rocker with humorous ten-
dencies. He will appear Friday
evening, February 1, in Love
Auditorium.

Since his start in the early
seventies, this singer-songwri-
ter has recorded seven albums,
his most recent being Pink
Cadillac, released in the sum-
mer of ’79. An earlier album,
Bruised Orange, earned Prine
nationa recognition after it re-
ceived a citation from Time
magazine as one of the top ten
LP’s of 1978. His songs have
been recorded by pop, country,
folk and rock performers, and
he has developed a mass audi-
ence through his many club and
concert tours.

The quality of Prine’s music
is described with varying de-
grees of admiration by different
people, but all agree on his
style. Says rock critic David

Marsh in The Rolling Stone
Record Guide: “After over five
albums of original songs, John
Prine has evolved from a senti-
mental but witty folkie into a
nihilistic but thoughtful soft-
rocker.’’ His lyrics tend to be
down beat, reflecting his per-
sonality and philosophy: Prine
is known for his moving ballads
and sad homilies. ‘‘But,’’ he
says, “I think all of my songs
are really optimistic.’’

John Prine was born in
Maywood, Illinois, and began
to play the guitar at the age of
thirteen. He got his big start by
impressing Paul Anka so much
that the latter supplied Prine
with airfare to New York City.
Once there, Prine ended up on a
stage with Kris Kristofferson
and. Carly Simon. The next
morning he signed a five-year
recording contract with Atlan-
tic, and from then on he kept
climbing.

John Stanfield, a Davidson
graduate and local singer-song-

writer, will be the warm-up act.

Find nightlife and excitement at the 7-11

By WHIT WAMPLER
Staff Correspondent

Are you one of those students
who complains about a lack on
night life at Davidson? Do you
wonder if there is more to a
Friday night than going to the
pop film and sitting in the 900
Room for a few hours watching
people just like the ones in your
dorm, eating house, and classes
(because they are, the ones in
your dorm, eating house and

_ classes)?

I’ve heard that if you really
want to find the night life in
Davidson, head for your friend-
ly neighborhood 7-11. Rumor
has it that some co-eds will turn
down an evening of music, soft
lights, and a bottle of wine in
exchange for the. gas-pump
speaker, fluorescent bulbs, and
Big Wheels of the third shift
down the road.

To find out if the 7-11 really is
where to find the action, Friday
night I visited Eddie Woodie
there, where since November he
has-been working the third
shift, from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. I
reached the mecca of junk food
and magazine addicts about
12:30 am. In eager anticipation
and with Eddie’s permission, I
settled down on the counter to
await the much sought-after
but seldom found ‘‘action.”’
Eddie was so busy just then
that I couldn’t ask him any
questions, so I watched a
steady stream of customers
until, suddenly at 1 a.m., he
had a free moment.

Before my big chance to find
the action slipped away, I
jumped in with a question. The
first thing I learned was that
the store had just completed its
busiest half hour of the night —
the last one during which it is
licensed to sell beer. The only

people who came in between 1
and 1:30 were some Davidson
students and a woman in a
fake-fur coat who wanted direc-
tions to 1-77. She wanted to
leave. The Davidson students
wanted beer, so they.left, too.

As I also considered leaving,
a man wearing and orange and
white 7-11 employee’s shirt
revealing a plain, white under-
shirt strolled in. With an au-
thoritative air, he began to pull
out-of-date baked goods off the
shelves. As he passed the
counter near Eddie, I heard
him muttering something about
‘irregular procedure in the
store’ and firing people. Sus-
pecting that I was the irregular
procedure and he was the
manager, I summoned my cour-
age, described my mission,
and ventured to ask him. for a
description of his work. With a
wry smile, he described himself
as a spy. Then a gleam came
into his eye as he confessed his
status as a full-time employee of
Davidson College moonlighting
as a 7-11 inspector. For proof,
he directed me to his picture on
the wall of Chambers which
identifies him as Sergeant First
Class Herbert L. Cagle, David-
son ROTC department.

In a helpful spirit, he began
showing me seme of the stran-
ger candy sold at 7-11. His
favorites were the Bubble Bur-
ger, a hamburger-shaped and
colored chunk of gum that
comes packed in a box, another
gimmicky container filled with
cheap candies, these shaped like
lunch items and ironically de-
signed to teach children good
nutrition.

Even more cooperatively,
Sergeant Cagle divulged the
name, location, and rates of the
local bootlegger for beer after

- 1:00am. He also indicated that

the after-hours 7-11 is upon
occasion the scene of a rousing
brawl, although normally it
harbors only a few dedicated
coffee-drinkers and CB-ers.

In keeping with~this rather
low key image of an early
morning coffee-club, the 7-11
has never been robbed, but
people have driven away from
the self-service gas-pumps
without paying. Employees do
take precautions, however, be-
cause I noticed Eddie industri-
ously depositing his receipts
over thirty-five dollars in the
safe since he keeps no more than

. that in the register. Since Eddie

was busy, I took advantage of
Cagle’s. gregariousness and
asked him a few questions. The
most unusual’ person he could
remember meeting in a 7-11 was
Richard. é

Richard, in his forties, had a
passion for trains and maple
syrup. He knew all about
every train that went through
Davidson, and he bought Log
Cabin syrup by the bottle which
he reportedly drank on the spout.
The biggest event in Richard’s
life- was. meeting Lawrence
Welk; he will show you_a
photograph of the occasion in
which he is’ holding a bottle of
his favorite syrup. That’s all I
know about Richard.

As for other characters fre-
quenting the 7-11: who might be
able to tell us where the action
is, I saw only Union Operations
Manager Tom Bessellieu .buy-
ing a comic book at 2 am.
Maybe Tom knows something
we don’t. At any rate, if you’re
looking for the action on a
Friday night, stop by the 7-11
and visit Eddie, You might.
have to wake him up, but he's —
looking for it, too.
