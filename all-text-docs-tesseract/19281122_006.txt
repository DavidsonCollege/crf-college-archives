A. T. O. Going to China

Eugene, Ore., Nov. 21—(IP)—FOR
SALE-~Fraterntiy house, fair shape. Are
all moving to China. Apply Alpha Tau
Omega.

* *

If Alpha Tau Omega, University of
Oregon chapter, accepted an invitation of-
fered them by a former Chinese cook,
now in the Orient, they could run the
above classified ad in the university paper.

Several years ago Hong Chung cooked
for the ooys. He cooked Chinese meals
twice a week. On those days the campus
declared an unofficial holiday and swarm-
ed to the A. T, O. house for dinner, oft-
times crowding the worthy brothers off
the table.

Chung went home to his mother coun-
try some years ago and established a tailor
shop in Hong Kong.

He still remembered the fraternity boys
and the other day he wrote thein a letter
inviting a wholesale visit to China.

Here is the letter, written in a readable
English hand:

“A. T. O., Eugene, Oreg.

“Dear Sir: I haye,the pleasure of for-
warding you these few lines asking you to
keep your health in good order and condi-
If you have any holiday, please
come to Hong Kong see me, according to
attached label and undoubtedly you will
meet me by the time I may accompany with
you to Canton to see our Chinese ancient
five story pagodas,etc., etc., of which to
your-entire interest.

As I have established a tailor shop in
Mongkok, my business seemed all right

. Hoping that you will come to see me
without fail. HONG CHUNG.”

P, S.—I think you are getting all right
and soon to be a millionaire.

The A. T. O.’s have not decided to
emigrate as yet, but they are interehted in
the postscrip from their old cook.

Why to Princeton?

Princeton, N. J., Nov. 21—(1P)—Con-
siderable amusement has been furnished
the Princeton “Wniversity campus by the
publication by the Princetonian of a list
of answers to the question asked of all
entering students: “Why did you come
to Pririceton?”

Here are a few of the answers:

Father and brother Princeton men,
Princeton spirit, tradition and reputation.

Thought more college life could be
found here.

Because my father wanted me to go t6
Yale.

I didn’t know the place then.

To graduate.

Advantages of country life can never be
overstressed.

Because I like the atmosphere of beau-
tiful buildings and gentlemen.

Because of the name it gives one to be
a Princeton man.

Good looking campus, faculty and presi-
dent.

For social reasons.

Anything Within Reason

Ithaca, N. Y., Nov. 21—(IP)—A “gen-
tleman’s agreement” has been entered into
by Cornell University men and the man-
ager of the Strand Theater here, whereby
the students may have all the fun they
like at the second Saturday night show,
providing they behave themselves the rest
of the week while attending the theater.

The pact was sealed following a dis-
turbance in the theater created recently
by the students, and after which the man-
ager in strong words told the under-
graduates where to “head in.”

One of the students wrote the follow-
ing letter to the Cornell Daily Sun:

“The Saturday night show at the Strand
was the scene of one of the most malig-
nant and spiteful attacks ever directed at
the Cornell student body. During a per-
formance for which a monopoly price of
50 cents was extracted, a sensitive New
York cowboy from Wyoming objected to
the good-natured remarks of disapproval
spontaneously emitted by the audience.
Despite the natural and: inalienable right
of a non-gratuitous audience to manifest
its disapproval of fifth rate ‘“entertain-
ment” by hissing and groaning, a choleric
manager lost his head and gave vent to
some bar-room language.

“T for one object to having Cornell
students designated as ‘dirty rats’ and
‘scum of the earth,’ and I feel I am not
alone in my resentment. Cornell deserves
an immediate public apology.”

Commenting on the letter, the editor of
the Sun said in part:

“Our correspondent is a member of the
17th century philosophical school that be-
lieved in ‘natural and inalienable’ rights.
There is, however, no exercise of these
alleged ‘rights,’ no booing or hissing at
University functions or dramatic club per-
formances. Does our corresponent as-
sume the right to cast off his painful gen-
tlemanly manner as soon he goes
down town ?”

In an interview with a Sun reporter,
Mr. Will Dillon, the manager in question,
promised :

“T am giving the students the freedom
of the theater for the second perform-
ance of each Saturday night show... I
wish to emphasize, however, that in return
the students must agree to confine all
boisterousness strictly to that perform-
ance on that day, and our gentlemen's
agreement will be carefully observed.

“T'll give them an arena for the Strand
‘Weekly Whoopee’,” Dillon added. “Any-
thing within reason and anything good-
natured will be permitted.”

‘MISS BLAINE SPEAKS TO
VOLUNTEER BAND

Speaking to a joint meeting of the Min-
isterial Band and the Student Volunteer
Group, on Sunday afternoon, Miss Mar-
garet Blaine, of Statesville, a former mis-
sionary in China and until recently the
traveling secretary of the Student Volun-
teer Movement, brought a message on the
“dynamic of discontent” and showed why
every missionary and minister should have
this quality.

In the opening part of her talk, Miss
Blaine said that her position as traveling
secretary had given her an unusual oppor-
tunity to gain an insight into student
thinking of the present day, especially in
regard to the missionary movements. The
observations that she made, continued
Miss Blaine, were both encouraging, and
discouraging. However, she wished to
bring to her audience a message not so
much from her own work but from the
recent book, ‘Seeking the Mind of
Christ,” by Dr. Robert E. Speer.

Dr. Speer in his book says that we live

far within the realm of our personality
and it is a psychological fact that we use
compparatively little of our latent powers.
The element which should dominate all of
us is the “dynamic of discontent.” By
this is meant the power to make people
discontented with bad condition and then
to help them better these conditions. We
should not only make other people that
way but should have the “dynamic force”
in ourselves.

With this statement of Dr. Speer’s as a
keynote, Miss Blaine made a most inter-
esting speech and concluded by saying that
there is only one source of content to be
found in the world, and this is Jesus
Christ, and if we are to show this content-
ment to others we must first know it our-
selves. We should be sure that our light
shines in the “darksome places” and it
should be the ambition of all religious
workers to bring everybody to the light
that is in Jesus.

STATISTICAL REVIEW

Harvard University’s receipts from
football in 1927 amounted to more than
a million dollars, of which nearly $300,-

000 was spent on various intercol-
legiate teams, traveling expenses,
coaches, rubbers, trainers, doctors,

uniforms and supplies. In the same
year, according to a report to the Na-
tional Collegiate Association by Prof.
Thomas E. French, of Ohio State Uni-
versity, Ohio spent $13,000 for intra-
mural athletics and $127,017 for a $1,-
600,000 stadium.

And this proportionate expenditure is
by no means unusual, says John R.
Tunis, in the current Harper’s Maga-
zine out today. “During the same year
Stanford University’s athletic receipts
were $194,000, and after paying for a
football stadium, a basketball stadium,
team expenses and equipment, it spent
the generous sum of $7,500 on intra-
mural sport,” he states.

“When a college spends $74,000 for
coaches, $5,000 for rubbers, and $6,000
for medical service in one short sea-
son of two months, it might appear
that intramural athletics would be like-
ly to receive less than their short from
the remainder, Strong and powerful
as is the great god Football, signs are
not wanting, to show that American

college undergraduates are beginning
to doubt its divinity,

“Intense class feeling began to die
out years ago. Classes today are far too |
large in the great universities to per-
mit of much class feeling or class loy-
alty being shown. The feeling so

ground in many of the large educa-
tional institutions throughout the
country.”

Seventeen per cent of the men and
twenty-eight per cent of the woman at
the University of Chicago atteded no
football games during a recent season,
according to the 1927 report of the fac-
ulty-student committee on the distri-
bution of students’ time, to which Mr.
Tunis refers. “If so many students
had been absent from a football game
20 years ago the situation would have
called for a football revival meeting.
“To the sports follower football. is
more than merely a game, it is a reli-
gion. It might almost be called our
national religion. Dean Willard Sper-
ry, of the Harvard Theological School,
said that the only true religious spirit
to be discerned among large bodies of
undergraduates today, is in «he foot-
ball stadium, So fundamental is the
craving of man for ritual in one form
or another, one college president said,
that when churches do away with
ritual’ it springs up in other’ and most
unlikely places. Ritual has so pre-
vaded football that it is fixed and
standardized from Maine to Califor-
nia,

“There are almost as many football
officials as players upon the field, and
they are handpicked for each game by
a High Commissioner who receives a
salary of ten thousand’ dollars for the
job; a job which does not appear to be
working out over well, Last season
more than three thousand dollars was
spent for spies to watch the officials
and report upon their fairness and the

there is talk of spies being set to watch
the spies at an additi@nal cost of three
thousand dollars.

“Colleges are waking up to realize

wrongly: called ‘college spirit’ is losing |-

that what they have on their hands is
a first-class octopus which is strangling
many legitimate pursuits of the edu-
cational institution. In most Ameri-
can colleges there are two fac-
tions; football and anti-football . The
football faction is well or-
ganized, powerful, articulate, embrac-
ing most of the students, the athletic
directors, their staffs, many of the in-
fluential graduates and members of the
board of trustees, and occasionally even
the president himself. There is no
denying the fact that a winning foot-
ball eleven is a great help to the presi-
dent of every college. After winning
everybody is in such good humor that
things run smoothly and quietly among
students and professors.

“The anti-football faction is smaller,
less powerful, vastly less noisy but
nevertheless growing rapidly. Some
of them would like to do away with
football entirely. Although it has been
powerless to act effectively so far, one
president told me that many thinking
graduates, undergraduates, members of
the faculty, and college presidents
would be happy if football could be
abolished without upsetting the ath-
letic systems of the colleges generally.”

SECRETARY VISITS

(Continued from page 1)
He also discussed any other matters which
were in connection with the “Y” work,

Mr. Loomis was especially interested in
the chapel stuation here at Davidson, and
highly commended the attitude toward
church attendance. The deputations which
the “Y” has been sending out to various
surrounding districts were praised for the
good work which they have been doing
and were urged to keep up the practice.
He was a great help to the men responsi-
ble for this phase of the work in making
suggestions and outlining programs.

Mr. Loomis came to us from the Uni-
versity of Tennessee, at Knoxville, Tenn.,
and plans to visit Duke, Carolina, and
other schools and colleges in this district

B. B. Neans, gate keeper at the south

their cars into the grounds. He says that

House Party at ‘Y’
During Homecoming

Perhaps one of the biggest and most en-
joyable events on the social calendar for
the past week-end, held in connection with
the annual Homecoming Day celebration,

A. at the “Y” rooms for the students and
their guests of the week. The rooms were
attractively decorated with yellow chrys-
anthemums as the outstanding feature, be-
fore a ackground of ferns and ivy. This
pleasing scheme was worked out under the
able supervision of Mrs. W. J. Martin,
assisted by Frank Hally, Buck Johnston,
Frank West and Bob Norton.

Immediately after the completion of the
Stunt Night performance an informal re-
ception, which was the main feature of
the program, was held. This reception
was largely attended by both members of
the student body and their out-of-town
visitors, among whom were numbered both
parents and many charming young ladies.
In addition to these, the faculty was rep-
resented by Captain and Mrs. Otto, Dr.
and Mrs. Lingle. Mrs. Melton, mother oi
the “Y" president, was also present.
Misses Sue and Cara Lina Moffett offi-
ciated at the punch bowl, where delicious
punch and cake were served to the guests.
After the reception many of those pres-
ent lingered for a brief period to partake
still further of the hospitality of the “Y”
in a pleasant informal gathering. The “Y”
reception has come to be a fixed part of
the Homecoming Day program and one to
which the students look forward with a
great deal of pleasure.

R.O.T.C.IINNOVATES
NEW POINT SYSTEM

On Wednesday, November 14, the first
place in the afternoon parade was won by
the second platoon of Company C. The
second platoon of Company B took seéc-
ond place, and the third platoon of Com-
pany B received the third award.

The third platoon of Company A was
given the first place in the parade which
was held on the morning of Homecoming
Day. The third platoon of Company B
was second, and the second platoon of
Company D was judged third best. ,

The R. O. T. C. Department has re-
cently adopted the plan of grading each ~
platoon by the number of places that they
win at the parades. By this system it will
be easy to tell which company platoon is
best.

At the present time, Company B is lead-
ing with seven points; Company C and
Company Dare tied for second place with
four points each, and Company A is third
with three points.

The standing of the platoons is as ‘ol-
lows: The.second platoon of Company
B is first with ‘four points; the third
platoon of Company A, the third platoon
of Company B, the second platoon of
Company C, and the third platoon of
Company D each have three points, and
the third platoon of Company C and the
second platoon of Company D are tide for
second place with one point apiece.
