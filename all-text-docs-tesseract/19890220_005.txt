Beyond Davidson
Busy week; tons o’ stuff

By HOLLY HAYES and
ED POWELL
Congress: A. controversial
51% congressional pay raise was
voted down by the House on
Tuesday after public pressure

forced congressmen to re-evalu- |

ate the proposal. The pay hike,
which would have increased con-

to $135,000, would have gone
into effect at 12:01 a.m: Wednes-
day had it not been rejected in a
voice vote. House Speaker Jim
Wright scheduled the vote when it
became apparent that the pay
raise did not have the support
Originally assumed among con-
gressmen and when outraged citi-
zens questioned its necessity.

Executive: On Monday, the
President’s chief ethics advisor
and general counsel C. Boyden
Gray resigned as chairman of his
multi-million dollar family com-
pany and placed his personal as-
sets in a blind trust to avoid con-
flict of interest charges. Promis-
ing that his administration will
“aspire to the highest possible
ethics standards,” ._Bush_reas-
serted his support of Gray, who
had. been the former vice-presi-
dent’s counsel for eight years.

The nomination of John Tower
to Secretary of Defense has been
impeded by ethical considera-

tions as well. The Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman
Sam Nunn (D.Ga.) has questioned
Tower’s ties to defense agencies
and has expressed concern with
his sexual misbehavior and drink-
ing problems. Bush’s appointee
has denied all charges brought
against him, but officials say that
these allegations could harm his
approval if a vote is not called this
week.

Secretary of State Jim Baker
has declared that he and his fam-
ily would sell all of their publicly
traded stock so as to avoid any
conflicts of interest. The contro-
versy arose last week when an
examination of his personal hold-
ings revealed his holdings in
Chemical Bank, a leading lender
to Third World countries. Since
the nature of his position involves
the shaping of U.S. policy on the
Third World debt, Sec. Baker
voluntarily withdrew all ties so as

to end any further debate.

The judge in Oliver North’s
trial last week that the jurors
would not be sequestered during
the trial proceedings, despite pro-
tests by the defendant’s lawyers
that this would violate North’s
right to an unbiased jury. Finding
suitable jurors has proven diffi-.
cult given the widely publicized
nature of the Iran-Contra scandal
two years ago.

This week, after months of le-
gal haggling, it appears as if the
trial of might finally begin. The
special prosecutor in the case,
Lawrence Walsh, has reached a
new agreement with the Justice
Department on the release of cer-

aide in the Reagan administra-
tion, faces felony charges for his
role in the sale of arms to Iran and
the use of the profits to furnish the

Nicardguan rebels.

President Bush: President
Bush unveiled his $50 billion
savings and loan bailout plan last
week. Congressional leaders
praised the quick response of the
Bush administration to the bank-
ing crisis which was shaking tax-
payers’ faith in the system. The
bailout, an effort to revitalize in-—
solvent banking institutions,
would be equally financed by
taxpayers and the Treasury De-
partment through the purchase ‘of
long term bonds. Some aspects of
the proposal call for tougher gov-
ernment regulations, give the Jus-
tice Department the right to crack
down on fraudulent S&Ls, and
call for the FDIC to absorb the
cost of insolvent S&Ls.

The President was in South
Carolina on Wednesday, making
a “political payback” to the State
that had given him a necessary
primary win nearly a year ago.
Last March, President Bush was
in a tight race for the Republican
nomination when he arrived in
South Carolina for the March 7th
primary. His victory in South
Carolina was thought to be the

stepping stone to his sweep of the
remainder of the southern states
on Super Tuesday.

The. President addressed the_
joints session of the S.C. legisla-
ture, appealing for bipartisan sup-
port to his newly proposed 1.16
trillion dollar budget. In his short
speech, Bush urged the legislators
of both parties to work together
towards in a accomplishing: their
goals. His speech, to the obvious
amusement of much of the legis-
lators, was peppered with allu-
sions to South Carolina history
and short antidotes.

Local: 5,000 angry teachers
converged on the statehouse. in
Raleigh on Tuesday. The teach-
ers were lobbying legislators and
Gov. Jim Martin for an increase in
their salaries and a thaw to the pay
scale freeze that has been in affect
since 1982. Teachers are upset
over the growing gap between the
rising cost of living and their lack
of increased income to meet it.

Briefs: Kitty Dukakis voluntar-
ily entered an alcohol treatment
program in Rhode Island over the
weekend. Her husband, Michael
Dukakis, made the announcement
and claimed her drinking problem
began after the November 1988 .
election defeat. Dukakis’: wife
has had previous problems with

- addiction, revealing in 1987 a 26-

year dependency on diet pills.
The fried chicken wars may die
down now that Popeye’s has ac-
quired Church’s Fried Chicken
for roughly $392 million. The
merger of the #2 and #3 ranked
fried chicken chains will end a 4-

two. It should also give #1 Ken-
tucky Fried Chicken its first sig-
nificant challenge in years.
