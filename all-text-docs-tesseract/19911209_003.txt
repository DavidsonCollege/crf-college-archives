teaching in Pakistan for four years,
Ratliff has taught continuously at
Davidson affecting so many
Davidson students since 1947. In
an address to the faculty last week
Economics Chairman Clark Ross
said, “His teaching has been char-
acterized as highly enthusiastic,
full of real-life anecdotes--from
Anson County to Pakistan--very
rigorous, and truly reflective of his
Own personal values and commit-
ments.”

“The function (of a teacher) is
to produce a person that will be
broad-gauged with a well-trained
mind who will be involved in
working on the serious problems
in the world,” said Ratliff. Why
economics? Ratliff quoted his eco-
nomics. professor, C. K. Brown,
who said economics helps you to
“understand society and make
plans for its improvement.”

Ross added in the address that
Ratliff “personally led the mod-
ernizing of economics at Davidson
College, introducing the interme-
diate theory courses as well as the
history of economic theory, eco-
nomic development and South
Asian economics.” Ratliff served
as the chair of the economics de-
partment fora portion of the 1950’s
and from 1966 until 1983.

Ratliff has been recognized
numerous times for'the excellent
quality of his teaching. He re-.
ceived the Kenan professorship in
1977, the Thomas Jefferson award
in 1971, the ODK Teaching Award
andthe Sears Roebuck Foundation
Teaching Excellence Award in
1991. Ratliff was also the first
member of the Davidson faculty to
receive a CASE Foundation award
when he was recognized as a na-
tional Gold Medal Winnerin 1985.

Ratliff’s visits to Pakistan be-
tween 1963-1966 and 1969-1970
with the United Methodist Board
of Global Ministries have had a
large influence on his life and the
lives of others who have heard him
speak in the classroom or else-
wheree. “While in Pakistan he
taught at the Forman Christian
College in Lahore.

Upon his return he became
chairman of a non-western studies
committee that brought a South

Asian studies program to Davidson. —

In Pakistan Ratliff saw firsthand

bution of wealth. Observing this
sad lifestyle Ratliff was even more

convinced of the importance of .

economic solutions,

The experience in Pakistan led
Ratliff to develop his idea of a
World Development Fund. This
fund would work to solve the large
income differences between the

northern (developedcountries)and_.

southern (lesser-developed coun-
tries) hemispheres. By being a
global sector that would tax all
countries according to income per
capita the fund would distribute
money according to need. In this
way, all countries would pay a tax
but the countries in the southern
hemisphere would. receive the
greatest amount of money gener-
ated by this tax. In 1987 these
ideas were published in a book by
Ratliff entitled A World Develop-
ment Fund,

This idea has been both ap-
plauded and challenged but Ratliff
maintains his optimism about this
global sector and continues tocon-
vey these ideas to others in hopes
that one day mass poverty will be
solved.
“ Ratliff’s service to students
does not end in the classroom. At
Davidson he was part of a self-
appointed committee that drafted a
resolution in 1960 that called for
integration of the college. Ratliff
was also involved in making the
ROTC Department voluntary. He
was also a member of President
Spencer’s task force and commis-
sion that made Davidson co-edu-
~ cational. Ratliff’s responsibility
on this commission was analyzing
the economic aspects of bringing
women.to Davidson.

Outside of the college Ratliff’ s
service to the community has been
extensive. Inthe MethodistChurch
he has served on various confer-
ence boards and committees and is
a member of the Davidson Meth-
odist Church choir, “His involve-
ment with Christian ministry is
evidentall around this area. Ratliff
has served on the Board of Direc-
tors of Mecklenburg Ministries.
Last month he was asked to be-
come a member of the Board of
Directors of the Crisis ‘Assistance
Ministry in Charlotte.

Ross said in his address, “No
one has been more willing to inter-
pret and advocate Christian com-
mitment within today’s society
than Charles. The number of pres-
entations which he has made within
church halls over the last forty

dreds.” Dean Terry said, “He’s a
Christian gentleman to the core.”
Ratliff has also served on sev-

eral town and county committees"

which have dealt with housing ine-
qualities, poverty and community
relations. In another illustration of
hiscommitmenttoaiding the Third
World, he was elected to the board
of directors of Bread for the World
in 1983.

,  ThelistofRatliff’s public serv-
ice contributions is endless. Ross
said, “Giving of time and expertise
for a worthy endeavor has always
beenacompletely natural reaction
for Charles, who, most assuredly
has never even contemplated the
sum total of his unselfish commit-
ment to others.”

~ Attheend of this month Char-
lie Ratliff will retire from his ac-
tive teaching at Davidson. He
commented on his love for teach-
ing and said, “Theclassroom is the
high spot of my day.” Ratliff still
finds ithard to believe that he is not
going to be teaching on a regular
basis any longer. “All of asudden
you realize you put it in the past
tense. You become probably a
stranger,” said Ratliff.

Ratliff had originally planned
toretire last June but agreed to stay’
on through this semester. After
this semester is over he plans to
travel to Florida with his wife, Mary
Virginia, for part of the spring.
Ratliff has also been invited to do
the Cornelson Lecture here at
Davidson in April. In the fall he
and his wife plan to travel out west
for a Pakistan reunion. He also
plans to put more work into his
garden, -concentrate on various
other hobbies and do a lot of read-
ing. Ratliffand his wife have three
grownchildren -- Alice Ann, Kath-
erine Virginia and John Charles.

In the spring of 1993 Ratliff
will return to Davidson as a part-
time teacher, or in his words he’ Il
be “back as a visitor.” He and his
wife plan to. continue. living in
Davidson. Beyond the next few
years Ratliff has various opportu-
nities such as going to Bangalore,
Indiaas a visiting professor, teach-
ing and working at a Methodist
College being set up in Zimbabwe
or going to work for a bishop in
Liberia who has been in contact
with him.
