| ATHLETIC NOTES |

“Tt never rains, but it: pours.” No
truer example of this old proverb was
ever brought to our attention than Sat
urday’s “liquid” weather propounded to
those of us who were going to Gastonia
to see the “Wildcat” and “Farmer™ fray.
All Friday night the rain came down
and when Saturday morning brought
more ‘Tain—and  necessarity plenty of
miud—Coach decided that the safest (at
any rate the dryest) plan would be to
forego his plans of journeying to Cras-,
tonia. “To say the fellows were disap-
pointed would be putting it mildly; and
when we consider the number of men
who decided not to prepare for Satur-
day's recitations as they were going to
be “off the Hill” the thing amounts al-
most to a disaster.

Plans are on foot to arrange another
game with A. & FE. in Gastonia on May
4. and here’s hoping they materialize.
We must have a chance to even up fora
certain football game we have in mind.

Clemson was forced to cancel last
week ; so the team had to be real patriotic

and have a ‘“gameless’” week.

lon comes over for two games this
week and the gossips say that she has a
dangerous bunch, Seuth Carolina alse

comes up this week to settle up that series
which now stands “one-all.”

Ralph Flowers has left school. His
eyes have been troubling him all the term
and he was forced to take the doctor's
advice and give them a rest. “This will
sound odd to some of the pitchers he has
faced this year, and likewise to some of
the football teams of last fall. His eves
‘seemed good enough then to pick out a
hole in the line where, to the outside ob-
server, there wasn't any hole. Some of
the colleges in Virginia will probably
also remember instances when “Buck”
dropped several nice ones thru the bas-
kethall goals in their gyms.

Jn losing Flowers we have lost our
best athlete. However, our loss is only
temporary. He is expecting to return
next year and we lose him only for the
few remaining baseball games. ‘This,
however, is a decided loss, and it is a
problem as to Coach's choice for the left
ficld position for the remaining games,

We will hazard the guess that Geor-
gia Tech and the rest of those big
Southern colleges have decided that the
Presbyterian “Wildcats” can do some-
thing besides play football. We have re-
cently sent both baseball and track teams

down there that have demanded atten-
tion.

“Georgia Tech 62—first place; Da-
vidson 32——second: place.” Not so bad
for a track meet, and when you consider
the fact that Georgia ‘Tech entered sev-
enteen mén and Davidson only five it
ounds “mighty good!"
