Quarterback Richard Howell drops back to pass in the 'Cats
Homecoming loss to Washington and Lee

Hampden-Sydney
Ends Football Win

Streak at Two

By Chris Hood

Though Davidson’s football
team entered Saturday’s contest at
Hampden-Sydney withatwo-game
winning streak, it was the Tigers
who jumped out early in ending
their own losing streak at three
games and handing the ‘Cats, now
3-5, a 35-18 setback.

Hampden-Sydney quarter-
back Bryan Crist, who threw for
274 yards and three touchdowns,
and fullback Cedric Gayles, who
hauled in a pair of Crist’s touch-
down passes and scored one on the
ground, were two of the Tigers’
main weapons. Running back Chad
Duncan added 109 yards rushing.

The ‘Cats fell behind 21-0 at
the half before mounting an offen-
sive charge. Quarterback Kevin
Holzworth replaced Richard
Howell, who struggled to com-
plete one of nine passes with a pair
of interceptions, and guided
Davidson to touchdowns on each
Of its first three possessions of the

second half. He threw touchdown
passes of 80 and four yards to
Bruce Bannister and Dan Lamar,
respectively, and scored the third
himself on a four-yard run. The
‘Cats failed on all three conversion
attempts.

Despite the offensive flurry,
Davidson’s defense could not hold
the Tigers’ attack. Gayles ran fora
37-yard score and caught a 50-
yard strike from Crist for the Ti-
gers’ two touchdowns of the sec-
ond half.

The previous . week,
Davidson’s offense exploded for
its highest-scoring game of the sea-
son in dropping Charleston South-
em at home 32-27. The five-point
margin was by far the narrowest of
the season; the win was also sig-
nificant because Davidson proved
it could come from behind and
take a close match. :
