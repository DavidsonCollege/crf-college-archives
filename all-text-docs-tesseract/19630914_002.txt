To Freshmen
(On Success}

For many freshmen, this first
week at Davidson College may well
have closely resembled a carnival.
(In the case of the Statesville Artist
Series, it was a carnival.) A dance in
the Union. many rush parties, and a
great deal of rush propoganda center-
ing on social life have constituted the
dominant theme of the week.

Therefore it may be extremely
difficult for many freshmen to begin
seriously concentrating on what every
one of them came here for: namely.
to acquire an education.

Freshmen have received. all man-
ner of advice from everyone they have
been in contact with here so far. and
they mav be somewhat oblivious to
more, but may we please put in our
two cents.

A sad mistake too many students
at Davidson make involves taking what
they see their first few days here too
seriously.

Specifically, these first ten days
tend to give a freshman the impres-
sion that in order to succeed at Dav-
idson, he must concentrate on being
a “great guy.” Such “great guys,” be-
ing generally likeable, are held up all
week as the ultimate in friends a
freshman needs to associate himself
with for his four college years.

A “great guy” lives by the dictum
that he who studies least and yet pass-
es, studies best. He concentrates in
the fields of card playing, road going
up, seeing of females, and scoffing at
studying classmates. Grades and extra-
curricular participation are a weak
second to personality development.

There are lots of “great guys” at
Davidson. They are liked by all, are

We would like to express our ap-
preciation to Tim Kimrey for a Wild-
cat Handbook which constitutes a
fascinating departure from past edi-
tions.

Although we can see Dean
White's point about prospective fresh-
men who know nothing of the college
perhaps taking some of Kimrey’s com-
ments amiss, the handbook gave this
year’s frosh (already coming to Dav-
idson when they received it) a rare
insight into college life.

While the editorial observations
were full of Kimrey’s dry humor, at
no time were the comments harsh or

at ease in any situation, date very
good-looking (and dumb) girls, and
generally have an all-around fine
time. They also have lousy grade point
averages, hold no major offices here,
will have difficulty getting into a good
graduate school, and won’t amount to
much if they do happen to get in one.

. “Great guys’ spend several
hours at the end of each semester com-
plaining loudly that the grade system
does not truly reflect ability. Maybe
it does and maybe it does not, but try
convincing the admissions committee
at a good medical school that your
astounding ability just somehow was
not done justice by your consistent
record of C’s at Davidson.

Our word to the freshmen is just
this: check the scholastic averages
and extra-curricular records of the
elected leaders at Davidson. These are
boys who worked hard for three years
and who are now enjoying the bene-
fits of that work.

Please remember this the next
time anyone suggests that you finesse
studying for a review in order to run
a few hands of bridge: people that
give other people a hard time about
seriously pursuing an education are
generally basically stupid themselves
and could not make grades if they did
study. Therefore they don’t study, and
use that as their excuse for doing
poorly, Let them laugh. You'll get
your chuckles three years from now
when you’re running this place.

Davidson College is a fine school
scholastically, and a good education
is here for anyone who cares enough
to work for it. We wish for the class
of 1967 a worthwhile four years. DTS

presented the freshmen with a head-
start on what to actually expect when
they got here.

Another. outstanding effort to-
wards naturalizing new Davidson citi-
zens was turned in by. Bob Ivey, who
organized and directed the YMCA
Freshman Camp.

At this camp the 100 freshmen
attending were given the opportunity
to meet the leaders of virtually every
major organization on campus, as well
as to hear talks by both students and
professors. All concerned benefited
greatly from the experience. DTS

Brotherhood Glows Faintly
Amid Rush Week Confusion

BY GREG GOVAN

“The quest and crowning of all good, life’s final star is brotherhood,” said Edwin

Markham, fraternally.

Davidson’s twelve Greek let-
ter groups have spent a rigorous
‘week trying to convince the
fresliman. class that this is not
only poetry, but Truth.

And after all the Who-do-you-
know's and hard sells and fast
rushes, the final star will burn
with relative quietude for an-
other year. For a week, though,
it has been something of a
super-nova, spreading its rays
into every nook and cranny of
the freshman dorms.

Response to the Light is
veried, but fails into pretty
stereotyped forms; it is an
otd Southern tradition to
flavor everything with ritual
and let what you really mean
shift for itself.

During Rush Week. the ritual

ts one of swapping shop talk-

about courses and hometowns,
clogging about in Weejuns and
Madras trying not to get too
controversial. No matter how

much anyone “knows what they
want” it is a little like a CORE
n. *ting in Jackson: everyone in
the urganization looks out for
toes pushed: beneath their feet.

Although nobody is going to
gain an insight into the prob-
lems of world disarmament
through rush conversations,
somehow everyone gets a good
idea of everyone else and de-
cisions are made. The insights
are ritual, such as how you dress
or how you react to remarks
about the Slater Food Service,
and they are expressed in a
language that sounds like Eng-
lish, but has a vocabulary all
its own.

Freshmen, on their part, are
like voters trying to see the
difference between the Re-
publicans and the Democrats:
everyone is talking for the
same things, but you know
there must be a difference
somewhere. There is, and in

the midst of riding about the
fringes of the merry-go-
round, they get a glimpse of
the machinery making the
whole thing go.

Ritual, that wonderful way to
present all time in a few mo-
ments, is the only way of selec-
tion, as it is the only means of
presentation. And so Rush is as
akin to religion as to politics.

Just as the country goes on
after an election and Religion
survives the religions, a little
of what Markham gushed over
comes out of Rush Week.

Everyone starts going to
classes and perhaps even to the
library. And, most important, a
little honesty comes out of sales-
manship. After the emotion, you
think, and subsequent emotions
are refined.

Until the next year when the
class of '67 squints at a Rushee’s
nametag to call him by his first
name. :

War On Academic Laziness
Recalls Previous Threats

“||. you are felt to be

an underachiever.”

With these words, Dean Burts and the Executive Committee ushered 80 students
into the ranks of Davidson’s academic underachievers late last month.

The letters mailed to ‘the un-

derachievers marked one of. the
first times college officia’s have
taken the trouble to name those
who allegedly act. as a drag on
the academic community.

Or. G. L. Abernethy, an ar-
dent foe of academic laziness,
probably was one of the first
to suggest @ penalty for the
underachiever.

Seeing each of the academi-
cally slothful as a_ potential
Socrates, philosophy prof Aber-
nethy suggested that under-
achievers be required to defend
orally or in essay form their
right to remain within college.

On Feb. 2, 1961, THE DAVID-
SONIAN, unable to dream up a
better solution, seconded Aber-
nethy.

Apparently the consensus was
too much for the controversy.
The cauldron cooled off until
mext December, when Dr. W. O.
Puckett took aim at the under.
achievers.

Puckett anmounced that there
were a good many underachiev-
ers in Davidson, and that some
were even lurking in his classes.

WHY UNDERACHIEVE?

He named four causes that
might tend to lead the student
from pursuit of the intellectual
to pursuit of the animal.

1. Some just don't belong in
college, suggested Puckett.
Some have been pushed in by
their parents. Others, he hinted,
are here to pile up aocial con
tacts.

2. Some underachievers figure
they have it made. With a job
waiting after school at Dad’s
hamburger stand, who. needs to
study?

3. Other students dreaming of
happy days in co-ed grad schools
rely on Davidson’s academic
reputation to ease them into
Carolina in spite of low gradce.

4. A final cause for mediocre
performance can be failure to
take a sober attitude to academ-
ic responsibilities, Puckett said.
Anything from too much beer

to giri troubles can be to blame.
COOL OFF THE LAZY

Dr. Puckett suggested a one-
year cooling-off period for the
underachievers. He noted that
the policy of Amherst was to
give academic stuggards a one-
year leave of absence.

Not to be outdone, THE DA-
VIDSONIAN suggested in a Feb.
2, 1962 editorial that there be
an academic crackdown on un-
derachievers.

The editorial proposed that
each professor should give stud-
ents the grades they deserved.

Faculty advisors could then
counset the underachievers, and
pass the names of those who
failed to shape up to the Dean
of Students for further action.

The new Dean of Students,
Richard C. Burts, Jr., was in-
terviewed to learn his opinions
on underachievement.

Burts agreed that a more

‘ professional and personal ap-
proach to student difficulties
might well be a blg step to-
ward alleviating Davidson's
underachievement problem.

The result was 80 form letters
mailed out in late August.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Simpson Spotlights

Richardson

“How can the man’ in the
street help prevent the blun-
ders (in foreign policy) by
which we have aided our ene-
mies to turn against us in large
areas of the world—areas where
our influence was peramount
and admiration for us high, fif-
teen short years ago?”

Answering this disturbing
question, William J. Lederer, in
his shocking, hard-hitting A Na-
sion of Sheep, cites “an over-
whelming national ignorance of
the facts about the rest of the
wond” as the chief eause of the
blunders.

Lederer recommends a for-
eign-students-in-Americe pro-
gram as one notable solution.

We Davidson gentlemen often
seem to float in a blissful cloud
of wine, women, and Wee-juns,
with but fleeting concern about
the state of affairs outside the
limits of Converse, Casolina, and
Conformity. Yet this year we
have at our disposal Richardson
Scholars from twelve different
foreign lands—students who
have been pitifully left out and
overlooked in past years and
who probably will be again this

Scholars

year—unless our national pride
and enlightened _ self-interest
gets a little shove.

And there is a chance. A cem-
mittee composed of representa-
tives from all campus organiza-
tions has been formed in an at-
tempt to stimufate and co-ordin-
ate the activities of the Richard-
son Scholars with the student
body.

There will be forums such
as the one held lest spring,
more talks on experiences
unique to these men, a for-
eign-trave! advisory group, a
newspaper series, and perhaps
even snow-skiing instructions
by Norweigen Gunner Skage-
stad.

The Richardson Scholars will
be introduced in assembly on
Monday, September 23; an infor-
mation sheet will be passed out;
these men will rotate around
Fraternity Couet one evening
meal a week. In short, there is
ample opportunity to get to
know our guests; and the op-
portunity is one that must be
taken while ft knocks.

On Frosh Challenges

BY RICK von UNWERT

The four-year Davidson experience seems invana-
bly to imply, somewhere in its complexity, a moral crisis
for the individual. If not a crisis, a crossroads, and usually
a turning point. Some arrive as freshmen with a spoon-
fed faith which promptly dissolves under serious scrutiny,

At Davidson, blind faith is a dead horse. During the
course of intelligent study in philosophy and religion,
many change horses; others forsake the horse and wander
on foot through the byroads of agnosticism, existential-
ism, atheism .. . or perhaps a religious nihilism. _

For many, the doubts mellow and stand aside for
consideration “later”. Their owners return to a stale and
generally inadequate womb. But for most, it’s Thomas
Wolfe’s “you can’t go home again.”

The reasons are numerous and often vague.

Sometimes friends take the place of the old God, and

a full life in college removes the need for spiritual

baltast. Skepticism is popular and it’s easy to be

flippant. Everyone is, and it’s relaxing.

Religious themes are easily overworked and their
substance often turns mealy in the mouths of authors,
lecturers, and free-lance stumpers.

SEE YOUR FRIENDLY LIBRARIAN

There are two books in the College library, one a
very recent and the other a current best seller, by Morris
L. West. They are hard-hitting novels and the best in
current fiction. ;

The Devil's Advocate and Shoes of the Fisherman are
both wholly modern and frankly secular in approach.
Each presents a fascinating plot and a bevy of thoroughly
credible characters. .

They are stories about men, about a cosmopolitan
Rome, and about honest and earthy people. ;

Between the two of them no phase of modern life is
ignored, from frustrated homosexuality to the sublime
meditations of a twentieth century pope. Emotions are
analysed, ideas are dissected, characters are confronted
with reality both within and without the dogma of the
Roman Catholic Church.

The author intended no spiritual balm. With perception
and universality rivalling Dostoyevsky, West describes
the desperate struggle his characters encounter in recon-
ciling themselves with the cosmos, and he writes in the
hard journalistic style of current fiction.

NO PANACEA PLEDGED .

These books will not resolve the moral conflict of any
Ivan Karamozov, any Holden Caulfield, or any modern
Hamlet. They offer no pat answers, promise no rewards
for sanctimonius virtue, provide no ground rules for
fulfillment.

They only bring into focus the problem of belief
and the fascinating questions of the mind in this
decade of confusion. ;

The books are powerful, lively, challenging, disturb-
ing .. . a strange combination of profundity and street-
level excitement. They cannot be digested by the reader
without a sympathetic involvement in the making of a
pope, in the making of a man, and in the making of a
drama as human as the doubts that are common fare for
the student in a small southern college for men.
