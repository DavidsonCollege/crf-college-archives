Davidson Does Make a
Difference—Is Worth Protecting

Among the many Davidson tradi-
tions is the persistent tendency for stu-
dents to criticize the college. Good
criticism is necessary for growth. but
we have heard some sincere and
genuinely interested students look at
their Davidson and sadly lament that
after all, Davidson College makes
hardly any difference—that is, it
makes little impact on society.

We feel, however, that there is a
great deal to be said for the other
side—for the Davidson College as a
living ideal. for the Davidson College
as manifested by the men she pro-
duces, and for the Davidson College
as the place where outstanding young
people spend four free years in the
grand experiment of life.

Davidson College, it has been said,
is a way of life. It is a tradition—a
fine heritage built by long generations
of successful alumni who have left
their mark in almost every Southern
community.

Its purpose has been to educate
men for the business of living an
abundant life. It does this through its
liberal arts curriculum, through its
reliance upon a dedicated faculty,
through a small student body. through
its belief in Christian values. through
the private support of those who have
faith in its future, and above all,
through the high caliber people who
make up the whole college.

The proof of the college is mani-
fest in the honor roll of alumni—the
leading ministers of the Southern
Presbyterian Church, many skilled
medical specialists in the nation’s best
hospitals, loyal doctors in local com-
munities, prominent lawyers, business-
men, bankers. merchants, teachers,
farmers, and labor relations experts
throughout the South, and particularly
the plain, solid. steady layman that

strengthens any community. These
men have made a difference.

As a small, Southern, liberal arts
college, Davidson's primary concern
is with the vouth of the Southeast. We
should remember that Davidson’s first
loyalties are to her section and to her
own particular people. We are not a
university, drawing from all kinds and
sending to all parts. We do not wish
to be.

Davidson is one of t! very few
outstanding small liberal arts colleges.
Its intangible assets are its fundamen-
tal strengths. Its heritage and its back-
ground give it character. To destroy
these is to destroy Davidson. Here we
must be especially careful to protect
it from the cunning plans of those
whose ideas and loyalties are foreign
to Davidson's way of life.

No doubt the best years of our
lives are those that we spend here.
Certainly the whole experience has
been a real luxury for every student.
For about two decades now, we stu-
dents have been thriving on what
others—our parents and our college—
have provided for us.

When we leave Davidson as
alumni, the time will come for us to
be the producers—to travel the road
we hope will lead us to the position
where we can repay more than was
given to us—just as others before us
did.

What Davidson College stands for
is worth preserving for others, worth
protecting against all who would
change it, worth supporting by what-
ever means we can, worth being
proud of.

The Davidson. tradition is a won-
derful reality that has made a differ-
ence in the lives of her alumni and
all others associated with them. It will
continue ‘to make a difference to
those who follow after.

Action Needed

It seems certain that this year's
IFC is not going to take any action on
instituting preferential bidding.

It seems awfully foolish to move
into a half-million-dollar fraternity
court without making any provisions
for solving the problem that caused
us to move in the first place.

The new IFC can do what this
year’s IFC has failed to do. It can
contribute significantly to wrapping
up fraternity problems by inaugurat-
ing the preferential bidding system.

On Drinking

In the next few months the facul-
ty will tackle the whole problem of
drinking, after-dance parties, and re-
lated matters.

The fundamental question to be
decided is just what kind of college
Davidson is going to be.

We have got a good thing—a thing
that is easy to lose, impossible to get
back once it is gone.

As the next few months bring stu-
dents and faculty together to discuss
this problem of drinking, we hope
that the result will be a reaffirmation
of the college’s stand for the tradition-
al high principals that have guided
Davidson over the years.

In short, we hope that any “rules”
or “regulations” relating to drinking
will not be modified, will not be re-
laxed from their present level.

Not only does relaxation and modi-

fication of the drinking rule mean
inoving from one ambiguity to an-
other, it also means retreating to a
position farther from the standard
that we know is the best for Davidson
College.

Down deep in our minds, we know
the type of college we really respect
and want is the type that Davidson
has always striven to be. It is the duty
of everyone who is interested in Da-
vidson to make sure that it stays that
way.

Coats and Ties

By moving into an all-new frater-
nity court we have solved only half of
the problem—that is, we have solved
the material problem.

Now, what about the other half,
the fraternity members?

Since one of the main features of
our new set-up will be adequate eat-
ing facilities, would not it be a good
idea for the fraternities to initiate the
practice of making supper the special
or main meal of the day at which time
members would dress in coat and tie?

Wearing coat and tie to meals
makes the situation more conducive
to fine eating. It is a practice that
works in other schools, and it could
add much to our fraternity life here
at Davidson.

Post Office at Davidson, North Carolina,

By BOBBY LIVINGSTON

We are at a stage in our his-
tory when the present relation-
ship of our student Christian as-
sociation with the various af:
filiations of YMCAs must be re-
vised or eliminated.

There are conflicts to this.
There are valid reasons for
withdrawing. and while it may
be hard to justify remaining in
the YMCA, it is impossible to
suggest any practical alterna-
tive organization.

COMPROMISE

Here is a proposed compro-
mise to this dilemma:

1. Make definite our position
with the YMCA, Today our po-
sition is all confusion. This
could be done by creating a
cabinet post to be concerned
with YMCA activities, and by
clminating the misleading ini-

VALID REASONS FOR WITHDRAWAL

Relationship of ‘Y’ to National Groups Must

tials, YMCA, frém our Davidson
organization.

PER CAPITA

2. Have our financial support
with the YMCA put on a per
capita basis. Today we pay a
collective 39° of our budget,
$275, for a “fair share.” There
is an alternative method, and
that is 50c per member.

We should adopt this process,
rather than the present one.
This would give every member
of the Davidson Student Chris-
tian Movement an invitation to
join or not to join the regional
YMCA.

HIGH INCOME

lt would also prompt the re-
gional YMCA to interest itself
far more in our local situation
in an effort to maintain its pres-

ent high income from us.

It would further give those
interested in the program of
the YMCA definite opportunity
to force its advantages into con-
spicuous display. Now as_ it
stands, there is no one who can
definitely state its value.

This would force the YMCA
to prove itself to us.

There are Internal and ex-
ternal reasons suggesting this
‘change. There are pressures
within the YMCA that some of
us do not like, and that very
definitely weaken the internal
position of the Davidson stu-
dent Christian movement.

‘The most obvious considera-
tion is the acknowledged pri-
mary interest in the race issue.
Directly or indirectly this is a

LETTERS TO EDITOR

factor. The direct implications
are to’ be answered for each one
personally. .

Indirectly, the emphasis on
this issue destroys any rele-
vance for the major portion of
the program of the YMCA at
Davidson College.

PREJUDICED

The Southern Region YMCA
to which we owe our sole sup-
port is prejudiced. So say its
officers. It is a regional organi-
zation. Therefore, participation
in its activities cannot give us,
as is often offered, opportunity
for a full range of opinion or
a meeting ground with repre-
sentatives from other regions.

Externally, the program of
the YMCA. and our obligatory
heavy financial support invite
a re-evaluation of our situation.

Internally, this would give
our organization impetus to a
much needed new emphasis. As
it stands now, Wwe are in the
rather hypocritical position of
having our emphasis turned
outward rather than inward.

DEBATE

We can see this in the fact
that so many Davidson students
debate the very place of ‘the Y
in their college.

We can sce this in the hard

LETTER TO EDITOR

Parent Says

‘Be Revised or Eliminated at Present Time

to explain observation that we
place our emphasis upon ex-
ternal relationships rather than
internal obligations. Shouldn't
it be the other way around?
That our external responsibili-
ties result from our internal
obligations?

Our primary responsibility is
to the Davidson student. To pro-
mote within him insofar as we

are able a personal religious
response. We have been neg-
jJecting that, our single respon-
sibility.

80%

There is a lot more that
should be said in support of
these contentions. This is a prob-
lem of such profound signifi-
cance as to suggest that the
entire student body be given a
voice in its determination. Be-
yond the fact that 80% of the
student body are members of
the Davidson YMCA is the very
real issue that the philosophy
of the movement is on trial.

If it. is felt that the average
student is not yet adequately
prepared to be given his choice,
then let us postpone for some—
definite time the question.

Magic in College's Name

Dear Editor:

“I enjoy the DAVIDSONIAN
and read every word of each is-
sue.

I have been very interested
in some of the proposed changes
and thought perhaps you might
like the reaction of a parent
who has been simply amazed by
the Magic of the word David-
son.

MAGIC WORDS

When we were children there
were many Magic words, but as
we grew older we found there
were very few words that are
really Magic. I had to grow up,
get married, and have a son
enter college, before I found

Davidson College: Home for Aged;
Poor Chapel Conduct, Stir Interest

Dear Editor:

Grandma B—— fluttered her
fan absently and noted with
satisfaction the ladies assem-
bled on the lawn around her.
They were engaged on one of
grandma's latest projects de
signed for the more elderly la-
dies. They were embroidering
doilies; some with Bible quo-
tations, others of poetry, and
Grandma herself and her aged
coterie were occupied with de-
picting the Seven Deadly Sins.
Grandma set aside her fan and
put another stitch into her
“Envy.”

Ever since Dr. John and
young Sam left last year,
the management of the
Christian Home for the
Aged had become a prob-
Jem. Because Grandma had
been a member of long
standing, of impeccable
Christian principles, and
because she appeared to be
one of the lingerers, the
directors of the Home
placed her in the admini-

stration rather than facing
the problem of procuring

another Dr. John, which
would have been difficult
indeed..

Now and then the ladies on
the lawn would glance nervously
up from their work to a win-

dow in the house which, while @

open to the summer heat, had
its shade drawn.

“I was sorry to hear about
Mrs. Jones’ illness this morn-
ing,” said old Mrs. D—— to
Grandma, and she couldn't re-
sist peeking up at the window
again.

TOURNAMENTS

““The Lord giveth and the
Lord taketh away,” allowed
Grandma. With this she pursed
her lips, looking up to the win-
dow. Grandma remembered
how Mrs. Jones had been one
of the main sponsors of the
Bridge players who had formed
cliques at the Home and upset
the serenity that Grandma
loved by holding tournaments.
Bridge playing! All they do is
get together and gossip about
one another, spreading discon-
tent. Besides, as Grandma said
to the directors, cards are a
work of the Devil!

That was two weeks ago,
and she was glad the direc-
tors saw things her way,
for since Grandma put her
foot down you hardly saw
anything of the women who
used to clutter up the ree-
reation room with their
gossipy Bridge games. if
the Lord meant for us to
know another’s private Sife,
he would have them tell us

about it, Grandma always
said.

“IL understand her children
aren't even coming to see her,”
Grandma said to Mrs. D——
with a knowing nod. The other
ladies in Grandma's confidence,
the ones working on the Seven
Deadly Sins, nodded also, and
looked in agreement to the
blank window.

“Is it true her husband left
her a targe_ inheritance?”
queried Mrs. D. ?

Grandma didn't know, but
frowned up at the window as
if looking for the answer to
this interesting question.

From the open window filoat-
ed the mutéd answer: “. . . bid
two hearts.”

Dear Editor:

Inconsideration and thought-
lessness permeated the tone of
chapel this past Tuesday dur-
ing the band concert. This
cheap, or may I ‘say vulgar,
form of derisiveness came only
from small groups, but let me
add that this is a small school
and many of its students have
proved themselves to be just as
microscopic by such meaning-
less contribution’ to campus
life.

It is my belief that when a

group of students such as our
concert band has given both of
their time and talents to pre-
senting an example of their per-
sonal as well as their collective
efforts in the form of a con-
cert, this program should be
accepted graciously and hum-
bly.

We of the audience should
certainly recognize the fact that
we are among those unfortu-
nate individuals who are almost
utterly lacking in any form of
musical talent, even so much
as whistling to the Colonel Bo-
gey March, better known to the
musical sophisticates of “The
Fabulous Forty” as the song
from the River Kwai.

In conclusion I would like to
add that a little joking is good
at the proper time and place,
but such uncouth actions are
leading this school toward stag-
nation in a pot filled with
cynicism. In a small school such
as ours a student must find out-
lets for his own personal satis-
faction and peace of mind.
These endeavors must continue
to be pursued by those who en.
joy them, preferably without
the scornful condemnation of
fellow students, filled to the
spilling point with selfish pride.

again a word that was truly
Magic. You all know the word
but how many of you realize
the Magic that goes with the
word Davidson?

PAY LATER

I was in a large store a short
time ago talking to one of the
owners. We both had boys and
the conversation got around to
colleges and to Davidson Col-
lege. This very successful busi-
ness man told me that any stu-
dent of Davidson College, can
come in here and buy anything
that he wants and pay for it
later at his convenience. We
do not need to establish his
credit. All we need to know
is that he is a student at Da-
vidson.

A group of college girls came
in. our store a few weeks ago
buying materials for spring
dresses. Again ‘the conversation
got around to colleges and 1
told them I had a boy at Da.
vidson. The change’ that came
over those girls when I men.
tioned the word Davidson was
amazing. A change from just
polite conversation to one of
intense ‘interest.

Eventually the girls told
me they would date a Da
vidson boy in preference
to any other college boy. In
fact for a first date all they
needed to know about the
boy was that he is a stu-
dent at Davidson.

A few months ago I. was in
the office of a well known doc-
tor. He was very busy and I was
just another patient. During the
conversation I told him I had
a boy starting his pre-Med at
Davidson. As with the girls,
again the change was amazing.
He had an offi¢e full of people
but he took fifteen minutes tell-
ing me what a fine school Da-.
vidson is and all about his as-
sociates and instructors that
were Davidson graduates.

OPEN SESAME

The name Davidson is sheer
Magic. In business, in the pro-
fessions, in the Church and in
your social contacts it will open
doors for you like the Open
Sesame of Ali Baba in the
Arabian Nights.

Someone planned wise-
ly and well to create all the
Magic thet goes with the
word Davidson. Perhaps the
original plans of Davidson

1 College ere old in years.
Also old in years are the
Constitution of the United
States or the teachings of
Christ. However the funda-
mental truths of all three
of these ave as new as to-
morrow.

I would go very slow with
any radical changes that might
destroy some of the Magic that
you as teachers and students
now have in your hands.
