Students and faculty anxiously
anticipated the January 23 arrival
of the Royal Shakespeare Compan
(RSC).

The return of the RSC marks the°

second year of a four-year residen-
cy at Davidson College that
encompasses performance and
educational approaches to selected
Shakespearean works.

The residency’s theme for the
2005-2006 academic year is
“Infinite Variety: Love and Family
in Shakespeare.”

The installment explores

Shakespeare’s take on love and
family through student and faculty
performances, public lectures, film
screenings, RSC coffee chats and
panel discussions.

“We were looking for scholarly
interests to represent in a wider
range,” said Professor of English
Cynthia Lewis, regarding this
year’s choice of theme.

According to Lewis, this year’s
theme allows participating drama-
tists and scholars to “fold a femi-
nist perspective” into their inter-

pretations of selected
Shakespearean works.

Rev. Dr. Otis Moss, Jr. spoke at
the Community Convocation cere-
mony on Sunday, January 14 in
order to open the Martin~ Luther
King Day ceremonies.

Moss had the unique opportunity
of knowing King personally, as
King provided Moss friendship and
spiritual leadership during Moss’
early days as a minister.

“Dr. Moss was the most power-
ful King Day speaker that we’ve
had,” said Assistant Dean of
Student Life Ernest Jeffries, who

coordinated the King Day activi-
ties. “He brought a unique perspec-
tive because he knew King and his
family, a history that others could-
n’t bring. He was thoughtful and
challenging, and didn’t try to be
politically correct. He taught us
and inspired us.”

Moss holds a Bachelor of Arts
from Morehouse College, a Master
of Divinity from Morehouse’s
School of Religion/Inter-
Denominational Theological
Center, and a Doctor of Ministry
from United Theological Seminary.

Eating disorders spark
concern, support groups

By KATE GILLESPIE
News Editor

Due to the sensitivity of this
issue, The Davidsonian editors
have changed the names of two of
the students interviewed to protect
their anonymity. They are referred
to as “Hannah” and “Annie.”

Eating disorders, which have one

- of the highest mortality rates of any

mental illness, are prevalent on
most college campuses. In recent
months, several student groups
have recognized the need to exam-
ine how Davidson’s campus envi-
ronment may play a role in foster-
ing eating disorders.

“Davidson students were often
the stars in their high schools,”
Counseling Center psychologist
Dr. Amanda Samson said. “Here,
many struggle emotionally when
they are no longer at the top of
their class. They often feel out of
control and eating is one thing they
can control.”

Heather Yopp ’06, who helped
start the mental health awareness
group Changing Minds last semes-
ter, believes that eating disorders
are becoming an_ increasingly
important issue at Davidson.

“Because I struggled with an eat-
ing disorder in the past, I am able
to recognize the behaviors,

thoughts, and fears in other peo-
ple,” Yopp said. “While being at
Davidson, it seems as if the number
of people struggling with them
have increased.”

Hannah, who battled an eating
disorder before coming to
Davidson, believes that the stress-
ful, overworked atmosphere on
campus makes students suscepti-
ble to eating disorders.

“You have a lot of commitments,
you’re really stressed, and you’re
constantly around people who will
critique you,” Hannah: said. “For
me, that seems to be my biggest
downfall, when I feel like people
are critiquing me and feeling that I
can’t get my work done.”

Annie, another Davidson student
who is struggling with an eating
disorder that began in high school,
believes that, although being at
Davidson did not cause her eating
disorder, college life has exacerbat-
ed her problem.

“Getting used to college life
affects it,” Annie said. “There are
all the choices and no parents
around to make sure you’re eating.
Eating for me gets so low on the
totem pole that it just kind of does-
n’t happen.”

Both Hannah and Annie agree .

Inclusivity of
PCC houses
in question

By AMEE PATEL
Editor-in-Chief Emeritus

A student survey conducted
last fall reveals that nearly 20
percent of Davidson students
believe organizations on campus
exclude members on the basis of
race..

In an open-ended question that
allowed students to list’ these
organizations, the Black Student
Coalition, Alpha Phi Alpha fra-
ternity and Kappa Alpha fraterni-
ty were mentioned by the greatest
number of students.

While the constitutions of the
three organizations clearly state
that membership is open to all,
the survey results reflect a com-
mon student perception to the
contrary.

Survey results ‘noteworthy’

The survey conducted as part
of a course on public. opinion
asked 557 randomly-selected stu-
dents, “Does any student organi-
zation on campus exclude mem-
bers on the basis of race?” The
next question asked the 19 per-
cent, or 106 students, who
responded affirmatively, to list
the organizations they perceived
to be exclusionary.

While students listed several
organizations, the Black Student
Coalition (BSC), Alpha Phi
Alpha (APA) and the Kappa
Alpha Order (KA) were men-
tioned most frequently, getting
36, 28 and 15 votes, respectively.

According to Professor of
Political Science Pat Sellers, who
teaches the course that conducted
the survey, the significance of the
results is that no other organiza-
tions were mentioned to the same
degree as the BSC, APA and KA.

“The most noteworthy finding
is that so many people view
Alpha Phi Alpha, the BSC and
Kappa Alpha as excluding people
on the basis of race when they
don’t,” he said.

Social pressures may serve as

exclusionary tools for the BSC
and APA
