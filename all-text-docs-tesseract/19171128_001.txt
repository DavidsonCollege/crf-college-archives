Large Score.

Davidson won a very one-sided but
interesting game on Sprunt Field Thurs-
day, victimizing the Wofford ‘Terriers
62 too. The visitors could do nothing
with the Davidson line and the repeated
forward passes from Spann soon got
them all up in the air. After the first
ten minutes there was no doubt as to the
outcome of the game. “Twas only a
question of how large a score Davidson
would roll up and a question as to
whether Wofford would score at all.
Wofford did her best work in the third
quarter and worked the ball within strik-
ing distance of the goal, but failed in the
final drive. The work of Ellerbe, Car-
michael, Burnett and Keaton was con-
sistent and hard. For Davidson the
feature plays were a 35-yard run by J.
McAlister, the line smashing of Burns,
the work around ends of Flowers and
the Spann-King combination for for-

Classes will be held as usual on Fri-
day, Seniors being excused after 11 a.
m. There will be no classes on Saturday.
but chapel will be held as usual.

This week marks the time when the
grave and reverend Seniors shall march
forth and expatiate to the waiting world
on the great affairs of life. Tt marks the
time when the accumulation of four
years of study and meditation shall bear
rich fruit in the outbursts of eloquence
and in the flights of oratory. About a
score of the addreses will deal with the
war, thus enabling us to fully campre
hend the causes. the probable results, and
no doubt the horrors too will be brought
close home to us.

Yet it is not alone the war that fur-
nishes themes fot the speakers. Some
are going to tell us haw to live, and oth-
ers how to die; some are going to delve
in the past; some are going to peer into
the future. To interpretate the past, to
explain the present, and to forecast the
future lies within the scope of the Senior
speakers.

There will be no faculty reception this
vear, the money for this cause heing do
nated to the Army Work for the Y. M.

DAVIDSON TO DEBATE.
LAFAYETTE COLLEGE

At a meeting ofthe Debating Council
held last Saturday it was decided to ac-
cept the offer of LaFayette College. of
Faston, Pa.. for an intercollegiate debate
to be held in March. This contest. will
prohably be held on the Hill or in Char-
lorte, though this and other details have
not as yet been settled.

LaFavette is one of the leading col-
leges of Pennsylvania and the North, an
institution of about the same size and
caliber of Davidson. Her athletic teams
and debating teams both have excellent
records, and Davidson is fortunate in
closing this debate with her.

The local Council is in correspondence
with several Southern institutions for
the second debate of the vear, and this
will be settled within the next few davs.

Until a man has found something
worth dying for he has found nothing
worth living for—Dr. Frank Crane.

Democracy means, first of all. that we
can , overn ourselves— Woodrow Wilson.

FRESH-J UNIOR.

In excitement, enthusiasm and spec

November 29 proved to be paramount.
The game was full of thrills and not un
til the final whistle was the score known,
and then it was a tic, 24 to 24. “Fhe
guarding of Schenck and the goal throw-
ing of Woods were largely responsible
for the success of their respective teams.

Game of Season.

The squad that Coach “Jiggs” Dono
on Wearn Field
Thanksgiving Dav will) probably line-
up as follows: ‘Thackston and Colbert,
ends; Potts and Connor, tackles ; Gilmer,
Bates, or Paget, guards; Gee, center:
Witsell, quarterback; Bartles and Arm
strong, halves; Banks, fullback. These
are the Clemson “Tigers” who will be
out to even up for the defeat Davidson
handed out to them last vear to the tune
of 33. to 0. Clemson's record this vear
is marred only by the 7-0 game lost to
Auburn. Citadel, Florida, Furman,
Wofford, South Carolina and Presby
terian College all went down before the
steady work. of the Tigers.

According to all the dope, Davidson
should win handily, but she is liable to
encounter trouble, especially with the
Clemson backfield. Witsell as a_ field
general is usually able to handle his team
to the best advantage, and is a good
ground gainer alone. Bartles and Arm-
strong have been showing up well, while
the line plunging of Banks has usually
come across with the required gains in
the pinches. The Clemson line is with
out doubt a good one. With such for
wards and such a backfield the Tiger ma-:
chine will give good account of itself.
Against this aggregation Davidson will
match the best line in’ North Carolina,
the Spann Flowers-Burns and-King com-
bination and Coach Bill. We'll match
our coach against any of them. When
the whistle blows Davidson will answer
“Present” —very much Clenason
will have to do her best—-and then some.

Since Davidson and Clemson have
been meeting on the gridiron, Clemson
has wan three contests, Davidson three.
and three have been tied. The scores for
the nine games are as follows:

1q00-—Clemson, 65; Davidson, o.

1996—Clemson, 0: Davidson, o.

1907—Clemson, 6; Davidson, 10.

1908—Clemsan, 0; Davidson, 13.

1909>—Clemson, 17; Davidson, 5.

191 3-—Clemson, 6; Davidson, 3.

1914—Clemson, 0; Davidson, o.

191s--Clemson, 6; Davidson, 6.

1916—Clemsan, 9: Davidson, 33.

Totals—Clemson, 100; -Davidson, 70.

Watch that difference in totals lessen!

so.

RECEPTION AT QUEENS.

The students of Davidson were de-
lighted to receive an invitation from the
atudent body of Queens College to their
annual reception, to be given Thanks
siving night from 8 to 11.

The two colleges that meet ‘Thursday
afternoon in a friendly but competitive
combat on Wearn Field, are expected to
meet again that night at Queens Col-
lege to be entertained by the voung ladies
of that institution. Those of the stu
dents who are going, anticipate the ac-
casion with much pleasure.

I want to utter my earnest protest
against any manifestation of the spirit of
lawlesness anywhere or in any cause.—

Woodrow Wilson.
