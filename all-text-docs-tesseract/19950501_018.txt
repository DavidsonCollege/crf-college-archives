Women’s lacrosse
wins with a bang;
beats Va. Tech

By Mary-E Lise BRUMFIELD

The women’s lacrosse team
ended their season with a bang
when they beat Virginia Tech 13-
11 Wednesday, which was also

LACROSSE

Senior Night.

The Wildcats put on a fine
showing in honoring their seniors,
holding to take the tight game from
the Hokies and finish the year with
two straight wins anda 5-10record.
___ Andsoended Davidson’s first
full season under coach Nancy
Billgerin which the team struggled
at times, but started to click better
toward the end of the year and

picked up some quality wins.

“T think the season was really
nice,” Billger said. “The whole
team did an excellent job... . The
Virginia Tech game was especially
exciting because it was a very close
game. It was down to the wire,
which made for a great way to end
the season.”

Virginia Tech charged back
from an early deficit and opened
up a 10-9 lead when it scored two
goals within a minute in the second
half.

Rebecca MacLean and Hedy
Moolenaar scored to put the Wild-
cats back ahead.

Virginia Tech tied the game
again later, but Sarah Hogan scored
to give Davidson a 12-11 lead with
three minutes 36 seconds left in the
game.

Kim Shuey then sealed the
game and capped the season witha
goal with 33 seconds left.

Kennedy and Sam Adams.

Ariail faces a long road to
making the team for a number of
reasons. First, playing at Davidson
puts him behind lineman coming
out of big schools.

Second, he will have to try to
beat out players who have been in
the league foracouple years. Third,
he’s learning to play a new posi-
tion.

“He’s been reacting and now
he has to act,” Thompson said.
“He’s never pass-protected before.

He has to learn how to set himself
and how to block.”

Ariail is excited about getting
to work against two of the best in
the business, but he is understand-
ably more excited about the whole
experience.

“Tam really excited,” he said.
“Even though I don’t really know
what my chances are of making the
team, I am just going to learn and
try to get stronger.”

But what are Ariail’s chances
of actually becoming an offensive
lineman in the NFL?

The most important factor, as
ludicrous as it sounds, is that Ariail
will have to get bigger and stron-
ger to combat the best defensive
linemen in the league.

The second most important
factor will be his ability to pick up
the nuances of playing on the other
side of the line and protecting his
quarterback, instead of trying to
turn the other team’s signal caller
into a grease spot. :

“Odds are that it won’t hap-
pen,” Thompson said, “but that
doesn’t mean it can’t happen. A
lot of kids never get the chance
even to be here .. . . His job is to
come in here and hopefully work
his way up from the bottom. He
needs to impress the coaches in
relation to the backup linemen.”

However, all Ariail can ask
foris that chance to chase the dream

of one day winning a Super Bowl

ring.

outing, comparisons to the 1991
team and speculation about
whether the team can repeat are
inevitable.

But Akers, as the veteran
leader of the squad, isn’t afraid of
them.“We’re a much different
team,” she said. “But once we put
it all together, we have the chance
to be a better team than the ‘91
team .... Every other team in the
world saw us celebrate with the
trophy in ‘91. That would be mo-
tivation enough for me to try to
beat us. But for me, I want to hold
that trophy again. I want that feel-
ing again.”

Small
water,
big fish

By JouN RoE
Outdoors Columnist

Who said you can’t catch big
fish in small water?

THE GREAT

OUTDOORS

I have run across many such
people in my fishing experiences,
yet I wonder where they get such
an idea. Small water, whether it be
a one-acre farm or a meandering
mountain stream, can be just as, or
even more productive than the large
watersheds.

One day last spring, after a
morning of trying to fool.a wild
turkey, I stumbled upon a clear
stream flowing amongst the hills.
The stream was hardly ten yards
wide at this spot and no more than
half a foot deep.

I followed the stream for a
while and saw that it was full of
excellent structure, swiftriffles and
deep pools. I told myself that I
would bring my rod back here once
the turkey season was over and
continued to walk out of the woods.

Spring ended, and the first day
I had the chance, I went back to
that stream. I quietly walked down
to the pebbly stream, cast a small
spinner into the head of a pool and
immediately hooked a rainbow
trout.

I unhooked the fish, let it go
and soon afterward had a large
smallmouth bass on the line. I
pulled the bronze-backed fish out
of the stream, estimated it to be
about one-and-a-half pounds and
put it back in the water.

I walked about two miles of
the stream that day, catching large
troutand healthy bass, many weigh-
ing more than two pounds. Al-
though the stream was very shal-
low at most points, some of the
pools were over ten feet deep.
There were also many overhang-
ing trees, stumps and undercut
banks, all of which provided ex-
cellent fishing structure.

Small water like this stream is
often overlooked by other anglers.
In all of my time spent on this
stream, I seldom saw another per-
son. Whether it was because people
saw this stream and wrote it off
because of its size or because no
one could find it, I do not know.

Sometimes fish in small
streams or ponds never see a lure,
leaving these fish to grow as large
as the habitat will allow.- The wa-
ter in this stream was so clear that
I could see the bottom even in the
deepest pools. It was so pure that
every fish was plump and had
plenty of fight. Water so clean is
rarely found among the larger lakes
and rivers.

In small water, fish are often
easier to find because there: is not
as much water to fish. But this
does not mean that these fish are
any easier to catch,
