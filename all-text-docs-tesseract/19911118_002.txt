The condoms went with a Student Dies

package of stories and editorials
about AIDS, sexually transmit-
ted diseases and unwanted preg-
nancy.

The newspapers were distrib-
uted at the college’s three cam-
puses in Pensacola, Milton, and
Warrington.

Student government leaders
criticized the paper, The Corsair,
for the move and called it a pub-
licity stunt. But the editors said
they were trying to make a state-
ment that condoms will help pre-
vént the spread of AIDS and
sexually transmitted diseases.

After Drinking Contest

GAINESVILLE, Fla.(CPS)-For |

Larry K. Wooten, 21, a drinking
challenge from his roommates
proved fatal.

The University of Florida stu-
dent died Nov. 5 after drinking
23 shots of alcohol, authorities
said.

~ Wooten and his three room-
mates were at a local bar, The
Mill, when Wooten’s roommates
challenged him to break a drink-
ing record. Wooten downed 23
shots of various alcohol in one
hour, Gainesville police said. The
bar was offering a two-for-one
special.

Wooten’s roommates took
him home shortly after he fin-
ished his last shot. He later started
vomiting and passed out. Anam-
bulance was called and he was
taken to the hospital about 2:15
a.m. Wooten was pronounced
dead at 3:45 a.m.

Wooten’ sbloodalcohol level
was not immediately known, but
police say blood alcohol levels
that prove fatal are usually about
40.

iff’'s Department is investigating ,

money allocation which is later to
be approved by the Senate,” Cov-
ington said.

Prem Manjooran, Senior Presi-
dent, opened the Senate dialogue
by expressing his “disturbance by
the controversy that has been gen-
erated by this issue.” Manjooran
emphasized that F.L.A.G.'s pur-
pose was “merely an attempt for
support and structure”.

Courtney Nichols, a member a
F.L.A.G., followed by stressing
that support of this group is “notan
endorsementof the lifestyle”. “We
have tried other methods for sup-
port groups but they have not
worked. Here, we have a way to
create a community without fear
orretribution. This is really a posi-
live thing and should not be viewed
as a threat to anybody,” Nichols
said.

T.K. Tibby, freshman senator
and member of F.L.A.G. echoed
the sentiments of Nichols. “I. sup-
port this group because it supports
understanding in the community.

Being black, I am used to notbeing
accepted; F.L.A.G. will provide
support for the homosexual com-
munity at Davidson,” Tibby said.

A few senators expressed con-
cern of their constituents that ap-
proval of F.L.A.G. was in some
ways sanctioning the practice of
homosexuality. “Inalotofpeople’s
eyes, supporting F.L.A.G. is indi-
rectly condoning homosexuality ,”
David Wright, Phi Delta Theta
senator, said.

Inaddition, senators expressed
concern over voting for their
elected constituency. “You have
to be careful how you vote, we are
elected torepresenta house or class.
Itisnot your personal opinion, you
should vote for the consensus, not
youself,” Paul Rybiski, senior
senator, said.

The Senate then voted and
passed the charter , with only three
abstentions, Rybiski, John Burns,
Sigma Phi Epsilon senator, and
Duncan Spears, Kappa Sigma
senator, and one no vote, Wright.

Rybiski explained his absten-
tion from the vote by stating that he
personally supported the group’s
charter, “however in my capacity
as class senator, I feltthatI couldn’t

vote in favor after many students
had voiced opinions agaainst it to
me.”

One concern expressed by
many of the Senate members was
the amount of student funding that
would be allotted to F.L.A.G.
“There is a lot of violent opposi-
tion to the college financing this
group,” Wright said.

Covington mentioned one
possible remedy for this concern,
illustrating a past instance when
Davidson parents and students
opposed a group’s funding through
the Student Activities Fee. In this
case it was possible for students to
obtain vouchers from the college
torefrain from financially support-
ing this group, although Coving-
ton noted it amounted to “only
about four dollars.”

Williams addressed this con-
cern over college financing of the
F.LA.G. group by comparing it to
paying taxes. “Weall pay govern-
ment taxes but we don’t get to
choose where all of it goes. There
will be an option for those who
wish to abstain from financially
supporting F.L.A.G.,” Williams
said.

lieves that in late spring or early
next year an anchor and video crew
will be sent to the games. These
games will not be broadcast live
because as of now DCTV does not
have a satellite dish.

The programming on DCTV
will also include non-Davidson
produced programs distributed by
U-NET.. This is a program based
out of Brown University that show-
cases the best nationwide college
produced programs.

Vauclain also commented on
the fact that DCTV is inviting stu-

dents to. do. their own shows.
Vauclain said, “This station is for
students and we definitely want
them todo what they want to do, be
itcomedy hours, talk shows, news,
whatever, we'll put it on,”

DCTV is run by a manage-
ment board that decides what shows
will be aired. The Program Direc-
tor is Kathryn Casey and the Pro-
duction Coordinator is TonjaLeck-
litner. The station staff of DCTV
is the former Union Board which
will produce some shows but wel-
comes other students to produce
their own shows.

Students interested in airing
their own program can contact
Casey with their ideas.

DCTV will also include an

announcement board that will
contain a calendar of events and
any additional advertisements or
announcements concerning hap-
penings on campus. This board
will run when no other program-
ming is scheduled. Vauclain be-
lieves that DCTV will start small
and will be a lot of just the an-
nouncement board for the first few
months.

The cable channel will also
air the DCTV studybreaks that are
shown in the 900 Room every other
Monday night. DCTV will also
continue to sponsor these food
studybreaks. The premiere of
DCTV will occur at a studybreak
held in the 900 Room at 10:00
Monday November 18.

ateness” of the cash award, while
hearing others speak in favor of
the cash bonus. He emphasized
that all of the faculty, regardless
of their opinion about the use of
the money, “are grateful for the
award.”

Dr. Thomas Kazee, associ-

ate professor of political science,
also said that he has heard much
talk among the faculty concerning
this award.

He said many members were
concerned about finding a use for
the money which would be “‘con-
sistent with the principle of fur-

thering teaching excellence.”

Kazee also said the discussion
“makes me feel good about our
faculty.”

Both Kazee and. Jones men-
boned that they have heard numer-

ous suggestions for possible uses
of the money, if it were to be de-
cided that the cash was not to be
given for purely personal uses.

Kazee said that the majority of
the talk he has heard has been in
favor of “re-investing” the money
into the College. Jones also said
that he has heard “more voices of
concern, than those of satisfaction.”
Kazee also reiterated the apprecia-
tion the faculty has for the estab-
lishment of the award in the first
place.
