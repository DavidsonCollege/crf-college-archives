rTITH THE
ILDCATS

By JIM LOWRY

There is just no such a thing as a sports column around
here any more.

The former illustrious sports columnists who
have had their picture at the head of this page
would turn over in their respective graves at
the sight of such a monstrosity as this prom-
ises to be.

To have a sports column you have to have
some sports news and to have some sports
news you have to have some sports, which
there ain’t any of. Of course we could: turn
this into_a joke book, nobody is denying that
it hasn’t been a joke, but we could pull some
Mirth and Madness jokes, but they would only
appeal to the higher types of minds. Or we
could pull some prognostigations about who
will win the Kentucky Derby in 1955. Or we
could have a sports quiz. In fact that we will. There will be
five questions in this sports quiz and it is open to all the mem-
bers of the student body except the members of the Davidsonian
and their immediate families, who could get the answers from
them and make the contest unfair which would never do at
old Davidson. To the first three contestants who get the right
answers into box 625 by Monday, July 10, there will go abso-
lutely. free with no questions asked one box of the new favorite
housewife’s delight the modern Dwaldge, or one pack of your
favorite cigarettes, at the local college emporium.

Ready ... Here we go.

(1) Who defeated the Manassa Mauler for the heavy-
weight championship of the world?

(2) Who was the only man to ever knock Jack Dempsey
out of the ring in a championship fight?

(3) Identify: (a) Pitcher of the “Blooper Ball”. (b) “Big
Six”. (c) Big Train. (d) Who is the highest paid professional
baseball player ever to play baseball and what is his main dis-
tinction?

If you will send in your answers as soon as possible you
will make it easier for the judges to figure out the winners. No
prizes will be awarded for duplication,

Since the favorite sport at Davidson this summer is bridge
the editor has decided to run a bridge problem in this column.
However, as this paper has to go to press tomorrow it will
take at least a week to figure one out.

Softball started Monday with the Pi Kapps ably supported
by the Pikas and the lone survivors of the Knights of Alcohol,
Jefeated the S P E’s 15-8. The Independents edged the
Sigmas 7-6. Not being, the least bit prejudiced it seems that
the Independents and the assorted Greeks have the top teams,

Then there is the story about the cross eyed left handed
pitcher who had two strikes on the batter, looked at the
plate; -threw to first; caught the runner off; the batter
swung; and the umpire called them both out. .

Well as we come to the 30 mark for this issue of the
fiddle faddle sports news we find the amazing St. Louis
Browns and the high riding Cards on top of the leagues
and the summer sisters betraying Dick Tracy.

Who's Who
In Montreat

By TIM WEBB

To start off the season here at
Montreat, the two Hays and Jim
Bisanar came to stay with Bill Mc-
Bride at Camp Montreat. Bill's ul-
terior motive was to try to get them
to clean up the Camp but knowing
these threé, no work was done. They
loafed satisfactorily, finally getting
on top-of Lookout Mountain, (the
smallest in Montreat), and collap-
sing. ‘This was all the exercise they
managed, flatly refusing to brave
the icy (temperature 61 degrees)
waters of Lake Susan in Montreat.
Stan Kennett and Van Covington
drove in in their respective automo-
biles and then drove out again.
Wilkes McCauley came up in a
Young Peoples Conference from
South Carolina. He walked and
swam hand-in-hand with the same
girl—I doubt if he did much learn-
ing.

Ken Barber breezed in for a day
to see Dot Hamrick and left her
in a blissful doze the next night
with the unfortunate Montreat boy
who dated her the next night. He
told me she had Ken on her mind
all evening and he accomplished
nothing. Congratulations Ken. Take
the Army+Navy “E” for speed and
efficiency and lasting effect. Sam
Ervin drove up from Morganton
for the same reason as Ken although
he weakly denies them, but as yet
he's accomplished nothing. Give
him time. Ed Golden and Alf Scar-
borough came up for the week-end,
playing softball and taking in the
grand old square dance in Black
Mountain Saturday night.

Before closing here is a bulletin
from Camp Montreat. Bill McBride
will welcome any boys from David-
son to relieve him of his strenuous
dating of the 189 girls at the camp.
He has no competition,

JESTINGS

By JUSTA JOAK
Well boys, this is the first of the
gossip to come out in this summer
school (in printed form), and even
though we have been here only a
few weeks, new things have already

begun to happen and old affairs
are still going on.
It seems that Lowry loves to

spread powder on all letters going
to Washington. I wonder why?
Lowry, don't you know that the post

office in Washington is busy al-
ready?
Sandy Shaw goes home every

week-end to see a Wagran girl. We
didn't know Sandy had it in him}

Doc Roddy seems to be very in-
terested in Lancaster in more ways
than one.

What is this we hear about Tag
Guiton being engaged?

Ole’ tall handsome Jim Alexander
seems to be able to keep more than
one girl’s picture in his room with
no conflict.

No girl has been able to interest
Sam Hay yet, but just wait. He
can't be like that all -his life.

Bill Medford seems to have it
bad with 2????. He is going to see
her again. Two week-ends straight.
Ain't it awful?

John Hagen declares that there is
only one for him but he still gets
around. You should have seen him
with the S. C. women.

Van Covington dates one girl in
Ridgecrest and writes another Air
Mail Specal the next day. Can't he
string 'em?

Dexter, Ed Golden, Sonny Blain
ind others also enjoyed the mountain
air—and women.

“I live from. week-end to week-
end when I can once again ???”
(Warold Amos).

Who was it that picked up David
Neill and Alfred Whitehorse for a
ride to Charlotte Friday?

And last but not least, Jim Love
that there no good
looking, women in Linville.

swears were
Love
must have his eyes, mind, and heart
taken by another. (He also swears
this paragraph will never see print
Hah! We have friends onthe staff!)

That's all
more can be dug up by next week,
Here's hoping!

for now. Maybe some
