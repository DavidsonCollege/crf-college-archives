We Are Coming, Blue
Ridge. Look Out!

Show Them the True Davidson Spirit

The last chance to get good reserva-
tions for the Blue Ridge Conference
will soon have past. The committee has
invited one hundred college professors
to the conference so the space is filling
up fast. A dozen Davidson men have
signed up and several others are most
sure to be there. Everyone who can
should by all means go to Blue Ridge.

To those who have signed up do not
fail to bring your Davidson pennants.
All the other colleges will be there
showing their college spirit and David-
son will, too. Chalmers says to leave
out all “extras” and pack in plenty of
“pep.” Davidson should have the best
showing at this conference she has ever
had.

Those who have signed up so far are:
L. L. McAllister, D. M. Chalmers, L.
B. Schenck, C. B. Robson, L. G. Cal-
houn, J. S. Brown, Ralston Bitzer, W.
P. Cunningham, Dr. H. B. Arbuckle
and Mr. and Mrs. R. W. Miles, Jr.

Davidson should have a splendid year
in the “Y" next term from the num-
ber going up to Blue Ridge. Let every
one come back next fall with a will to
put the “Y” across.

“WE DIE FIGHTING,” BUT
WATCH US COME BACK.

Davidson made a very creditable show-
ing in the Southern Intercollegiate ten-
nis Tourney held in Atlanta, May 22-
May 24, the Wild Cats finishing in the
final brackets of the doubles and in the
semi-final of the singles.

The entries were: Georgia Tech,
Tennessee, Tulane, Mercer, and David-
son. Georgia Tech ran the doubles in
a hard fought match against Davidson.
while Tulane won the single honors.
Davidson sent as her representatives D.
F. Hall, Jr. and F. H. Spence. Both
played sterling games and kept up the
old tradition “That we die fighting.”

Mercer University was eliminated by
an unfortunate misunderstanding. Da-
vidson defeated University of Tennes-
see 6-1, 6-2, 1-6, 7-5. Hall’s service was
perfect, keeping the Tennesseans in the
defense at all times and his well placed
passes missing the back line by only a
few inches. Tech defeated Tulane 6-4,
6-7. Tech played great tennis in the
finals.

We have heard of all kinds of prop-

a novelty in the fields of high finance.
“Forty cents a week, or if you want to

The student council ticket composed
of Spann, Spence and Liston wished to
thank the party giving it its one vote in
the recent elections. .

Ow Harrel has discovered a way by
which he may cut down the high cost of
smoking. He has planted the entire
supply of ashes which he cut from his
veteran pipe during the month of May,
and says that he hopes to find a good
crop of tobacco when he returns in the

fall.

Sharks of finance take notice and see
how it is done by an expert. R. T. L.
Ect. Liston in a recent deal asked the
following question, as he was trying to
buy a certain article. “I'll start at five
dollars and you start at ten dollars. If

At the coming term of the local court
of injustice the case of the famous beef
trust will be tried. The boarding house
managers led by the chief of the Yid-
dese, Jew Wilson, have brought suit
against the beef trust composed of
Campbell, Sherrill and McPheeters, not
Inc. ‘The case will be argued before his
honor, [key McAlister. The affirma-
tive, no, we mean the prosecution, will
be represented by C: Gaither, the sink-
ing young lawyer from Catawba coun-
ty. He will be contradicted by His
Majesty Spann, who read law for sev-
eral years under Junie McLees, the emi-
nent author of numerous works of juris-
prudence among which may be men-
tioned “The civil rights of a hobo,” “Is
crap-shooting legal?” 1 public opinion
had its way all parties concerned would
be banished to Charlotte, or some equal-
ly dead hole, for an indefinite period.

In the Peanut Parcher’s  bone-head
contest, which has just closed, John D.
Wiley secured the dog. ‘The race was
close until the 15th of May, on which
date the above referred to gentleman
aroused himself and endeavored to read
his Eco parallel for the term, since the
exam was to be held on the following
day. Chapter four in a certain work
on statistics was among the readings as-
signed. John D. went in search of the
said book, which he knew had a red
binding, and finally came upon what he
considered was the object of his quest.
After he had read some ten pages of
the book and made .some remarks the
substance of which was that the pro-
fessor had already told them all of that
stuff on class, another boy entered the
room and informed Mr, Wiley that he
was engaged in perusing Angell’s ‘'Chap-
ters from Modem Psychology.”

Be sure you know what you are alo-
ing and then do it.

All things on earth must end and so
we have come to praise and bury the
Peanut Parcher—until next fall. For
the time has come to say farewell, and
pone, and so have you. And we are
glad you have—for we know you enjoy
being with your home folks Again, and
that girl: Oh. she must indeed be glad
that you have left: Davidson.

We've tried to entertain you here this
cpring, and if we haven't succeeded—
well, some people never could appre-
ciate good things anyway. But now we
have come to that one good thing which
must always touch every heart—Good-
bye. “The Peanut Parcher has finished

BV. D. “Pebble,” the oman from
Stoneville, and Boaz’s delight. He is
not exactly a lady charmer but has high
ambitions, hoping some day to rise to
the accomplishments of “Guy” Jones.
“Pebble” lacks only one thing that Jones
has, and that's slick hair, But maybe
that can be acquired. He has been bor-
rowing snake gil recently anyway. “Peb-
ble" expects to get everything out of to-
bacco that there is in it, as was shown in
his Junior oration—even from a plug of
“Brown's Mule” toa Pall Mall. “*Peb-
ble" has many accomplishments, — but
greatest of all his ability to act as guide
in “D" Co. Recently he lost his com-
pany on the athletic field. and they were
all out of step but “Pebble.” He takes
‘Terrestro—and after July the first he
will drink it for two purposes. But “ Peb-
ble” is a great business man as was well
shown by his great success on the David-
sonian. He las quieted down during his
Senior year and is no longer a “Bloody
Soph.” but a refined gentleman, and an
honor to the class with which he grad

“Rail Road” Clarke.

“Star.”

“Bob Clarke, the star heaver of the
Presbyterians, will probably oppose the
Virginians this atternoon.” So read the
headhines of the Charlotte Observer, and
"Rob" Clarke did oppose them, in fact
he shut them out. “Vhe next day the Ob-
server read thus: This ‘unassuming’
young: chap) pitched brilliant ball and
the husky lad can also hit, driving out
three hits in five appearances at the bat.”
‘Thus we send “Railroad.” as he is most
commonly known an the campus, into
the game of life. to make hits on dia-
monds and play the hearts—in fact we
noticed he had some very good tryouts
and peneral practices during the recent
commencement, We hope that he will
continue tn fame in the world of chance

Sam, Gilbert, Dalton, Ga.

“FL A.C. O. T. S. Gilbert” came
here four years ago popping his ear. Since
then he has been popping bum jokes and
Field Artillery “bull” ever since. We
have no doubt that in future years he
will be popping corn for five cents per
bag, thus demonstrating the fact that he
is a business man and not one of the
common herd. Gilbert has been sorely

disappcinted in love this spring and we
think that it is due to the fact that Ham-
mett poured a pitcher of water in his
boots. ‘These boots have been placed in
alcohol and are being preserved as an
heirloom for the future Gilberts, We
have no idea when the annual will be
out but if he doesn’t stop going to Char-
lotte so much we know that the money
will soon be out. (His palms always
did itch for “de mun.”)
“Yank” Boswell, Penfield, Ga.

Boswell says he hails from Pentietd.
Ga., but we always thought he was from
Winston-Salem until he received a small
nsured package, Since that Boswell has
wen a little crazy but I guess everything
will be O. K. if he has a few diamonds
put in contents of the little “package.”
Boswell has so much love. for “Jay Bird”
that he followed him to Winston at six
o'clock in the morning to find out if he
passed “Bug.” This goes to prove that
their fove is mutual. Another proof is
that he presented a turtle to “Jay Bird"
that night before the exam. 7

_ Possum Dunlop.

Despite the fact that Possum is getting
very old and gray-headed and set in his
ways, he’s falling in love. He recently
went on a visit home during senior week
and the number of fair dames that he
met would surround or astound you, He
spoke of meeting up with a very fast
voung flirt and as Possum is a flirt they
seemed to suit each other and fell in
love, He says her name is Miss Ethel
Alcohol, so that it is no wonder. that
she has intoxicated him with love.

GRIT AND ACCURACY:
Students, as a rule, are apt) to im-

properly emphasize the importance of
the routine class work in’ its bearing
on their future success. By this. state-
ment it is not meant that we should not
apply ourselves diligently to the details
af class work, bute rather to call atten-
tion to the valuable opportunities in. the
experiences of college life for the acquisi-
tian of an erect and manly expression,
and dast but by no means least, that grit
which enables one to play a seemingly
losing game and smile.

Every student owes it. to himself to
avoid that handicap of mental and phy-
sical indifferdnce which is known as
“slouchiness” and to cultivate accuracy
of thinking and acting. Alertness leads
to an access of ease and bearing that
distinguishes the natural leader from
those who make it a habit to follow.

Accuracy in thinking is likewise. a
necessary asset to a successful career. Far
tou many students are satistied with ap-
proximate answegs, Practice in co-ordi-
nating ideas and expressing them tersely
and clearly will be rapidly reflected in
the ease with which others grasp the mat-
.ter which is intended to be conveyed.

_ Grit is perhaps the greatest asset of
all. ‘The ordinary student is not  pre-
pared for the rough edge of life. His:
feelings are too easily hurt and he is
ready to give up the sponge at the first
ijolt. “The idea of grit belongs in. the
cliss-room as well as on the campas and
severy student should endeavor to acquire
that which makes for real accamplish-
'ments in every walk of life. In short
Jone should keep the goal in mind and
not remark the roughness of the road.—
