Alumnus Writes of
Activities in East

The following letter from W. P. Parker
was received the other day by J. F. Pank-
ney, president of the student body:

Pyengyang, Chosen, Korea,
February 11, 1927.
Dear Davidson Boys:

Naturally the first I want to do is to
congratulate you on the State champion-
ship in football. It may seem a tardy con-
gratulation, but you must remember that
I ami.a long ways away. Davidson men
everywhere are rejoicing with you, and
want you to know that this victory means
as much to them as it does to you there.
May greater things come.

Then I want to say how proud we all
are of Davidson and its record in every!
way. We are glad to see the college go |
forward, and hear all the good news that
comes to us from time to time. May God
bless Davidson always, and each one of
you studying there, and may you each
one go forward also in the work that God
has for you to do,

!

As for news from this end, as usua
there is not a great deal of interest to
you, perhaps. The school work goes on
as usual, and we have had a good year so

far. We send out a fine lot of seniors in
March. Examinations for the graduates

begins next week, and commencement
is on the oth of March. We hope for}
better things to come and feel encouraged
to believe that our science department
will get recognition before many years
now. We have waited long, and much
patience has to be borne, but we look for
success in the end. As you know, we al-
ready have recognition for our literary
department. We also hope for recogni-
“tion for the ‘Academy here, which is a
Northern Presbyterian institution. We
are noteas near recognition for our South-
ern Presbyterian Academy in Chunju as

funds that ought to come before very
long, too.

The chief tppic of conversation this |

winter here has-been the weather, for
“we have had a hard winter, the hardest
in many years, and the cold is not yet
over. As you may know, Korea is class-
ed by insurance companies -as_ semi-
tropical. Judging from the high death

rate, I guess they have a right to so class.

the climate here, but judging from the
thermometer they certainly have no right
to do so. Southern Korea is about like |
North Carolina and Virginia in climate,
but here in Pyengyang,’and still more to |
the North, we have cold weather. The
thermometer goes down to 20 below some-
times. About ten years ago we had a
number of 20-below days, and not so
very many years ago we had some also,
but the last few winters have been com-
paratively mild. This year our cold
weather began about the oth of Decem-
ber. We had 13-below weather then:
then again in January we had about ten
days of 20-below weather. It turned a
little milder and weé thought the worst
was over, but a week ago it got cold
again, and we have been having 15-below
nights right along up to and including
the present. I can not predict when we.
are to have bettet days. We have much
wind, also, and that is always hard, but
the ground has been covered with snow
and ice, and that has been better for us
than the dust we would have had other-
wise. |

Special meetings begin tonight in the
Kittle chapel which I attend. We hope
that many will be brought into a saving
knowledge of their Lord during these
-Meetings. We have held our own well
at the chapel, and have had good attend-
ance. Recently we have called a pastor)
who gives us about one-fourth of his
time, so that the work is progressing |
nicely. Pray for us and all the work that |
is’ done. We often’ think of Korea as.
evangelized, because the response here|
has been so wonderful, but after all only |
about one in sixty as yet know what the!
gospel means in actual acceptance. Most |
all have heard the Word in some form or |
other, and only those in far off districts‘
are utterly ignorant, but so many have!
not heard intelligently yet, and there is |
still much, very much, to do. Pray for
the foreign missionaries, and also for the |
native Church. We need a revival and|
long for one, and know it must begin with

Ten Classes of Alumni

to Meet Commencement}

Every Five Year Class Since 1877 to
Reunite

Every alumnus of Davidson College
has a lifelong invitation to return at
commencement-time each year, but ten
classes scheduled for special re-
unions in June. These are every five-
year class, beginning with 1877, the re-
union of the .latter group marking the
half-century point.

The Alumni Secretary is already mak-
ing plans to have the largest number of
alumni return this year that ever
come back to Davidson at one time. He
is particularly anxious to obtain the ac-
curate and correct of those
classes which are listed for return this
year, and in order that alumni, faculty
members and students can assist him in
this work, he is planning to publish in
The week of the
classes which will return.

If anyone knows about the following
men in the classes of 1877 and 1882, they
asked to notify the: Secretary im-

The C. E. Training Class

The Christian Endeavor Training Class
was led in its weekly meeting by R. G.
Calhoun, assisted by C. R. Pritchett and
W. T. Ratchford. The topic for the day
was “Stewardship.” This was expounded
by W. T. Ratchford who talked on “Stew-
ardship” in Christian Endeavor and by C.
R. Pritchett who talked on “Stewardship
of Time and Money.” Pritchett told how

Stewardship could be applied on the
campus. We are bound as Christians to
give one-seventh of our time to the Lord.

This time can be spent:in attending reli-
gious services on the Sabbath and by at-
tending the morning watches held over
the campus. People take Stewardship of

In the business session it was decided
that those men on the campus who have
