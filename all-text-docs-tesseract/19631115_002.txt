THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1963

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

Administrative Underachievement

We have almost reached the stage
of teeth-gnashing and breast-beating
in our frustration with the continuing
lack of progress being made by the
Davidson College library.

It is a readily admitted fact that
Davidson’s library is “not what it
should be.” But the not-so-readily ad-
mitted fact is that virtually nothing
is being done to remedy the situation.
Either through oversight or laziness,
Davidson has only been able to add
22,500 volumes to the library since
1958.

Talk about under-achievement!

First, a few statistics — publish-
ed in 1960. but significant none the
less. Bear in mind that Davidson now
has 1.000 students and 100,000 vol-
umes, but also remember that the
other schools have made similar
strides toward improvement. See sta-
tistics in box below.

Needless to say. Davidson finds
herself in a very embarrassing posi-
tion. Proclaiming to be a strong liber-
a] arts college and yet possessing the
most inferior library among so-called*
“good” schools seems to be a pretty
basic contradiction. This contradiction
has been “explained’’ and apologized
for, but the fact remains that some-
one(s) must take the blame for our
book deficiency.

It is rather ironic that the stud-
ents are begging the Hill to put more
books in the library. After all. we’re
supposed to be spending all our time
at after-dance parties, up the road,
watching TV. playing bridge, or just
generally under-achieving. Admitted,
the poor library is not the cause for
rampant under-achievement, but the
available selection in the library is
certainly not conducive to  over-
achieving. Any kind of advanced re-
search is virtually impossible, especial-
ly in the fields of history and English
literature. And the Bible and religion
section is unimaginatively stocked, to
say the least.

In a very real sense, the library
should be the taboratory for the liber-
al arts student, especially those study-
ing the humanities. And, in this re-
spect. the biology, chemistry, and phy-
sics students are much more adequate-
ly equipped in their respective labora-
tories. It should also be remembered
that students in the scientific discip-
lines also have need for a well-stocked
library. Knowledge of previous theor-
ies. experiments, and accomplish-
ments is essential to the science stud-

ent if he hopes to do any creative re-
search of his own. In this respect too,
the Davidson library is inexcusably
poor.

The most appalling bit of foolish-
ness is the College’s amazing ability to
spend large sums of money where they
are not needed, or where the need is
minor compared to that in the library.
A new wing is now being added to the
College Union. Result: more dining-
room. space, better pool tables, wider
selection in the Stud, and more space
to play games. Oh yes, and the Kim-
broughshop will have a new home
here. Splendid! And, as if this new
wing weren’t enough, the Board of
Benefactors was recently informed
that “plans are in process for the
renovation ahd modernization of the
main Union. structure in the near fu-
ture.” Now, if we ever get a moment
to relax, at least we will be able to
do it in style.

We are well aware of the prob-
lems involved in raising money to in-
sure the continued growth of the Col-
lege. And we are aware that gifts for
endowment and the library are much
harder to procure than those sums
which erect tangible additions to the
physical plant bearing the benefactor’s
name. We are certainly grateful to.
the Danas, the Loves, the Ovenses, the

Richardsons and all the other people
who have expressed their interest in

a better Davidson with their specific

gifts and bequests. But can additions
to the physical plant be justified when
the most important educational organ
of the College—the library—is so
visibly inferior? We think not.

Excuses for the failure to improve
the library are numerous, and most of
them are invalid. Some meager pro-
gress has been made, primarily with
money made available by the Dwelle
Fund, which, while one of the most
noble bequests in recent years, is
simply not enough to carry out the
tremendous job that needs to be done.
It has also been said that the library
does not have the staff to catalogue
and shelve $400.000 worth of books.
Well, it seems to us that $400,000
would also help to “buy” some addi-
tional permanent staff members. In
short, dollars will do just about any-
thing you want them to do in this par-
ticular case.

And so it seems that everything
boils down: to two lament-facts: 1)
Davidson College has a pitiful library
and has no money to bring it up to
par: and 2) No all-out, concerted ef-
fort has or is being made to do any-
thing significant about this. Mr. Rob-
ert Sailstad has been quick to assure
us that “the College has always, with-
out fail, given highest priority to basic
educational. needs—endowment for
teachers’ salaries and for the library,
and the library has had top priority
for the past seven years.”

Well. if this be‘true, where are
the results of such a dedicated quest
for educational funds?

We are weary of hearing boasts
from the Hill about the very mediocre
progress that has supposedly been
made toward improvement of the li-
brary. How can you boast about a
mere 22,500 volumes in the past five
years?

And, please. no more excuses.
You have had to make no excuses
about short-comings in the - physical
plant. simply because you have work-
ed diligently to provide us with
everything we need in that area. Now
use your energy to get on the prover-
bial stick and bring us $400.000 with
which we can buy a decent library
and equip it with an adequate staff.
Fill that new $200,000 wing you keep
telling us about when we ask what is
being done about the library. Ad-

mitted, it will not be an easy task.
Most benefactors would rather carve
their name on a building than print
it in a book. Regardless, we feel cer-
tain that somewhere in this great free-
enterprise land of ours there are peo-
ple who recognize the importance of
a good library and have the where-
withal to help us. Approach every pos-
sible foundation and philanthropist
whose business it is to provide such
funds.

Steps must be taken now. If you
wait much longer, you might as well
make plans to convert the vacant one-
half of the library into a handball
court and give up your goal of attain-
ing full Ivy-Leaguedom. If it comes to
this, the chances are pretty good that
some friend of the College will be glad
to fix it up real nicely as a memorial
or something.

It is indeed hard to believe that
Davidson College, that up-and-coming
Ivy-clad_ institution, that dedicated
producer of 250 whole men every
June, can look a student or an educa-
tor or an administrator or a scholar
from any other institution in the coun-
try straight in the eye and say, “We
can give our men a good, complete

liberal arts education, even though we
do have a sub-standard library.”
Can you really, Gentlemen?

_LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

NSA Issue Protagonists
Offer Pre- Vote Remarks

Spratt

Dear Editor:

Monday the student body will
have its chance to speak out on
NSA. This is probably one of
the first referendums to be held
at Davidson in a number of
years.

The student council is pub-
lishing a statement which I hope
everyone will have the opportun-
ity to read and examine before
voting. In view of this state-
ment, what I say here will be
brief and to a particular point.

Specifically, | hope that the
student body will not act
whimsically Monday. | hope
that no one will vote as a lark
or vote merely to join up with
the crusade to ride NSA out
of Davidson.

I am not trying to overdrama-
tize the referendum or make
villains of those’ who oppose
NSA. Frankly, this is not a life-
or-death affair for the Student
Council], and we can, in fact,
operate without NSA. If we dis-
affiliate with NSA as a result
of the referendum, there will be
little change in the day-to-day
concerns of student government.

We can argue the drinking
question or protest parking tick-
ets with equal facility But in the
overall picture, in the long run,
NSA will make a difference at
Davidson, and those of us who
have participated in it recognize
this fact.

Mainly, the contribution of
NSA will come in attitude and
perspective gained by those in-
volved in student government,
though there will be also the
benefits of ideas, source mater-
jals, and programs which we
can develop from NSA.

The specifics can be better
treated in a lengthier statement.
I merely hope the student body
realizes what is at stake. This
fs not just a popular referendum
for the hell of it, for the fire-
works and soap-box oratory. The
outcome may well affect the
quality of the student govern-
ment Davidson is to have. ,

John Spratt °

Freeny

Dear Editor:

John Spratt has pointed out,
and rightly so, that “no one has
claimed that the NSA has been
a dynamic organization on the
Davidson campus.” The claim,
in fact, has been that NSA is
dead at Davidson.

By an agreement last year be-
tween Spratt and Carrell, the
NSA was relegated to the posi-
tion of an indirectly influential
organization. The problem is
with the word influential. I ad-
mit that it is indirect—what else
is there to do with no direct
evidence of it? But it is so in-
direct that the “long list of
specific benefits” potentially en-
joyable by the campus are still
unenjoyed and potential. They
have been for some time and
there is little sign of material-
ization, as we have been prom-
ised for the last three stagnant

NGA years.
Perhaps, then, in this final

stage of the NSA question, one

should ask why the NSA has so
utterly failed to produce any
significant or tangible results
at Davidson. The answer has al-
ready been given: because the
NSA has become so fascinated
with sogio-political questions, it
has become ineffective both as
a sounding board for student
opinion and as an organization
dealing with the problems of
student government.

The problem is, then, that
the NSA cannot be both a
political platform for student
opinion and, simultaneously,
an effective, even remotely
objective student government
association. This does not
mean that such an organize-
tion could not exist. If means
that the NSA is not such an
erganizetion and without radi-
eal reforms can never be one.
Such reforms, however, sre
very remote.

The question finally becomes
one of the retention of member-
ship. Why should Davidson con-
tinue to be a member of thé
NSA? The indirect benefits are
remote and hard to find. It may
be a broadening influence for
those who attend the conven-
tions, but we ean broaden our
outlooks without this type of an
association and affiliation.

Spratt admits thet the “NSA
is not the solution to all of our
problems.” Rather, he feels, "It
is the best that we have.” But
why settle. for less. I believe
that we can do better. It is not a
question of sour grapes, but of

‘no grapes at all.

Pat Freeny

Ivey

Dear Editor:

Before we roll the NSA on

Referendum Day, as you poetic-
ally threatened in a recent edi-
torial, I hope that your readers
will take a moment to reflect on
the real issues involved in the
controversy.
A chief criticism of the or-
ganization has been its lack of
direct relevance to the selfish
Davidson student. This appears
to me to be a misunderstanding
of the purpose of the NSA. It's
not intended to be a “super
student council” in which we all
can participate. Neither are the
innovations which it prompts to
be branded “NSA inspired.”

The NSA is rather an associa-
tion of student councils—for the
benefit of member councils, for
whatever they can gain from
membership. And if our student
council believes that it profits
from this membership, then let’s
give them the opportunity.

Our council obviously wants
continued participation in the
NSA. Our most recent Student
Council presidents—both reason-
ably intelligent individuals, cer-
tainly capable of understanding
the proper functioning of their
special organization—have ech-
couraged Davidson’s member-
ship. Perhaps we aren't person-

ally aware of every contribution
the NSA has made to Davidson.
But if our Student Council and
its leaders believe that they’ve
funetioned more efficiently or
more confidently because of it,
certainly each of us should be
willing to let them use one
sixty-seven thousandth of our
annual fees to let them continue.
Even though the NGA’s con-
stitution liberally states that its
political views are not neces-
sarily representative of member
institutions (e.g., Davidson), I
think that perhaps this political
issue is the real source of local
opposition. And, this being the
case, the rotten tomato in the
Union showcase should be re-
placed. As a tribute to the toma-
to’s donor, I suggest a bunch of

sour grapes.

Reflection

ALONE ON A CRACKLE-RUG:
INDIAN RICHARDSON SCHOLAR
QUESTIONS HIS CAMPUS ROLE

BY ROMIR CHATTERJEE

Fall has come and almost gone, they say — and I —
alien amidst the fallen leaves. The dry. yellow and the
dry brown — the call of the Hub and I am crashing
through the brown crackle towards Main Street.

All paths seem to lead through the brown crackle.
Pleasant, very pleasant, when you are walking, to know
that you are walking — and that only happens when you
stomp across this crackle-rug. I've never walked across
a crackle-rug before. And when I stroll across the yellow
and brown, I feel delightfully foreign.

And that starts me thinking. It is strange to be a
foreigner, especially when you've never been one before.
How shall I explain my native ways? (And explain I must;
all foreigners have explanations to make!)

The fog must be cleared; | must convey the
idea that even in the sweltering heat, the dirt, the
flies, the diseases of the tropics, we can be “good

guys” (“Are we?”, | ask

myself, knowing that this

trend of thought will lead me from one dilemma to
another). And soon | am toying with ambassadorial

“bull” . .

. about our being very sympathetic to

America, and the common “cause” . . . FREEDOM!

Yes, how devoted we are to the “cause” and—stink-
ing rich America. FREEDOM. Should I suggest, oh, so
gently, that neutrality is freedom?

Cogitation continues...

There's the confounded caste system of which I am
required. to speak of knowledgeably and pass ‘judgment
on: and the sacred.cow (MOO, MOOO! }); and the econom-
ic hurdles we must cross; and underdevelopment (a word

that only seems to connote

rickets, prominent rib cages

and haunted, deep-sunken eyes); and birth control for .
our population explosion (I begin tending inevitably
toward cliches); and — the heralds sound their clarion
call at this point — CHINA! ! ! How bloody illogical of
us (the mysterious ways of the East!), in fact, downright
demented of us to persist over her admission to the

United Nations.

Then, there’s Goa . . . how in heaven shall I, should
the need arise, defend or, tear to shreds an age old Indo-
American conversation piece — V.K.K.M. — to avoid
using that ugly word: Menon.

My progress across the crackle-rug, by now has
come to a painful stop. The responsibilities of play-
ing the part of unofficial ambassador weigh heavy
upon me. | am at the point of yelling, in a state of
complete distraction. Whitman’s line, adapted:

“Christ! that 1 was in my lover’s arms,

And |, AT HOME, AGAIN...“

But this burst of poetic rhetoric doesn’t seem to help
very much. I am still befuddled and bewildered by my
thoughts — waiting for the breath-giving inner realiza-

tion, the moment of truth,

the revelation — bla, bla,

bla —. The depression persists. How utterly futile to try
to convey an accurate picture of the homeland (simply:
millions of dark faces looking up into what should be
light, but isn’t). Hell, I can’t tell them that, I say to my-
self; that’s just expressionistic bull — no place for that
sort of an idea in this ambassadorial capacity.

Tam wobbly at the knees. But, getting hold of myself.
I stop what may well result in an epileptic fit. “Forget
it,” I say, wiping the foam from my mouth, and moving

on.

Two steps forward. — plod, CRASH — plod,

CRACKLE

YES, DAMMIT.— CRACKLE! ! !
Thank God for the crackle-rug! I’m off, once again,

crashing through the yellow and brown .

. running

wildly, impulsively across the good ol’ crackle-rug. On to

the Hub!

Once again, feeling delightfully alien, amidst the

fallen leaves.

On NSA: Sackett Asks
Responsible Response

BY FRED SACKETT

On Monday the student body will decide the question of Davidson’s continued
membership in NSA. This referendum will serve, to a great degree, as a reflection of
student awareness of campus issues and affairs. Will it be a reflection of a mature
and responsible attitude? Is there such an attitude among the Davidson student body?

The college catalogue makes
this statement about it. “The
tradition of student government
is deeply rooted at Davidson.
Recollections of collective action
by students in the area of self-
government reach back to the
undergraduate days of the oldest
living alumni . . . Through its
officers, elected by their fel-
lows, students at Davidson
largely control affairs of the
campus.”

And the Wildcat Handbook
says in relation to encouraging
student awareness and respon-
sibility, “the real challenge dur-
ing the next four years will be
to participate as well as spectate,
to contribute as well as re-
ceive, to develop depth as well
as breadth. You're not bound
over to the customs of the col-
lege. If you don’t like them,
speak out, stand up, object; but
do more than object. Criticism
is rife at Davidson; the creative
contributor is unique.”

You may laugh, and say these
statements are a farce——some
college propaganda. But if you
laugh, are you not laughing at
yourself? How responsible have
we shown. ourselves to be? Can
we name the members of the
council we helped elect, if we
voted; have we ever consulted
them on issues, or made recom-
mendations fer action? Do we
even read the articles in THE
DAVIDSONIAN on _ Student
Council meetings and delibera-
tions? Do we show positive
awareness to the student coun-
cil of constructive opinions? It
is sad to say, but the answer is
NO.

The petition for a referendum
is one of a very few petitions in
the last several years, and I

speak in favor of the question of
NSA being raised. It has created
an awareness in the student
body that we are in NSA. It has
created an issue on campus. It
is giving the student body a
chance to show its responsibility
in weighing the evidence pre-
sented.

But will our vote reflect a
THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE of
the subject? And will our vote
show that this awareness has
been created for nothing, if we
do not continue our member-
ship?

How many of us know that
there are now 384 member col-
leges, and these include Har-
vard, Yale, Princeton, Agnes
Seott, ete.? That in our own re-
gion of Virginia, North and
South Carolina, there are 33
member colleges, including
Duke, Carolina, N.C. State, W.C.,
Queens, Hollins, and Sweet
Briar? .

John Spratt has outlined the
advantages of the Student Gov-
ernment Informational Service
library, the material available
on political issues, the Educa-
tional Travel Inc. and Polback.
We also gain much as a member
of the Regional NSA, and show
to other schools that Davidson
exists by attending and taking
part in the assemblies and con-
ventions, such as the one in
Raleigh this weekend.

A criticism has been that the
student body does not share all
the benefits, or is aware of
them. Isn't this lack of aware-
ness due in part to us, or do we
have to be spoon fed on every-
thing that goes on? Can’t we
find out some things for our-
selves? Are we aware of the ad-
vantages received from other

national organizations by the
local members, such as THE
DAVIDSONTAN? Yes, by the
ideas and better work we re-
ceive from things learned by
the members and officers of
these organizations. Isn’t the
Student Council improved in a
like manner, enabling them to
do a better job for us?

And then the big issue is that
of the radical. political stand
taken by NSA. Or is the stand so
radical, once one finds out more
than the few controversial ones?
- Certainty it is not a conserva-
tive organization. But are we to
withdraw—“gather our marbles
and go home"—merely if we are
in a minority and the organiza-
tion doesn’t express our exact
opinion?

These issues and debates help
us, as students, become aware of
the issues of our time, political
and social. We can’t withdraw
into four years of “isolation.”
especially at a liberal arts col-
lege. And if we are such cham-
pions of “conservatism,” are we
helping its cause in NSA by
pulling our voice out?

John Spratt, speaking of the
membership and benefits of
NGA, said, “Perhaps these ideas
won't change the face of David-
son, but they will add signifi-
cantly to the college.” If careful
consideration of the issue is
given, can't we easily see $30
worth of benefits in a year? Let
us hope the student body will
weigh the evidence, and exercise
its responsibility—not just vote
it out as a fluke.

Which way will you vote en
Monday, and what will the re-
sults show?
