was rendered with remarkable harmony and
expression.

The intermission was very agreeably filled
by members of the Dramatic Club playing
in the farce “Radioactivity” by Conrad Fred-
erick Smith. Station F. O. B. Detroit, a
radio dispensary of static and hot air, was
the scene of the comedy. The rare jokes
and rarer characterizations caused an abund-
ance of laughs and the cast received great
applause at the end: Gordon McSwain as an
old farmer was probably the best drawn
character, though Fred Smith as the direc-
tor, Bill Green as the Scotch philanthropist,
Bob Horton as the Ethiopian, and Tyree
’ Dillard. in the feminine role were almost
perfect.

Opens Her Here Today

| opening of Davidson’s first moving pic-
ture show. The feature picturé for to-
day and tomorrow will be “Madam Be-
have.” A short comedy will bé run as
an added attraction.

The moving picture show occupies the
building formerly -—known as Carter's
garage just opposite Crayton’s garage. |
The building has been completely reno-
vated and attractively fitted up. The
managers of the theater have a contract
with one of the largest film producers in
the country and first class productions
will be consistently presented to the Da-
avidson students and townspeople. The
program for the coming week has not
yet been made public.

The moving picture show will fulfill a
long felt need at Davidson. Up until.
this time the students have been forced
to journey Mooresville to view the
productions of the silver screen. A great
deal of extra time has been devoted to
making the trip back and forth between
the two towns. It will now be possibte
for the students to attend the
without the resultant of
their studies,

The managers of the show
nounced that they will co-operate with
the Y. M. C. A. managements on Satur-
day in catering to the mill people alone.
“Wild West” shows will be run on Sat-
urday nights in pursuance of this plan.
In this way the “Y” will not be deprived
of its only source of income,

There is many a college in the country
that would give a pretty penny to take
on these boys with hopes of developing
their gridiron ability.

There are quite a few energetic, hon-

hereabouts which would have seen to it
that any member of this quartet was
well. fed and well sheltered, had he
agreed to adorn his alma mater’s ath-
letic field.

But its a assumption that the

hours in the class room if they want to
pass, some stiff workouts on the athletic
field if they want to make’ Monk Young-

One ofthem, Phil Jackson, stellar half-
back, will wait on the table in the din-
ing hall in order to defray part of his
expenses, we are told. Phil could have
selected either of several institutions we
know and spent that time and labor he
will need for waiting on the table in

playing bridge, and had nothing to wor-

ry about expenses.

Some may put it down as belogney, but
the writer is told that sentiment caused
the boys to make their selection.

One of them is quoted as saying that
the clean sportsmanship of the Davidson
players and coaches last fall won the ad-
miration of the young high school stars.

Another one said: “I couldn’t help but
