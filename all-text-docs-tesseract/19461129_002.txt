There are no golden streets at Davidson

College may take if he so desires. That

is the gold of spiritual and intellectuial

development, and I am certain that no
matter how long or how hard we may
try we will be able to give to Davidson

only a very small fraction of what David-

that there is such a place as Davidson

Letters To The
Editor .

Mr, Ed Sutton, Editor
The Davidsonian ,
Davidson, North Carolina
Dear Mr. Sutton:

Your editorial in The Davidsonian nas
been read with interest. We can quite
appreciate any and all objections to high
prices. The entire country is suffering
from the same disease. Dr. Brown will
tell you that the name is “inflation”.

During the past four years there has
been a slow and steady increase in the
prices of both goods and foods. This was
slow and steady until this past July, when
it was greatly accelerated by the ham-
stringing of the OPA and‘ since October
all prices are skyrocketing with every day
and delivery, ~

Most of us have been’ in the service
during the past four years and have been
accustomed to buying at post exchanges
and ship’s services, where ‘the goods were
bought by the government on_a_closed
‘market, in which the Government was the
only buyer, and were sold at a minimum

_ profit.

Shortly aiter_the opening of school

get milk, as the dairy can no longer get

Several dozen boxes of stationery and
of candy have had to be thrown away be-
cause of the carelessness of some students
in spilling beverages over merchandise and
of setting wet botties where they do not

making every effort to provide a satis-
iaetory and pleasant Store and Lounge
tor the Stndent Body. It is a business.
and must be run as such. Too many oi’
the previous stores have. wound up in
the “red.”, Constructive criticism and sug-
gestions are welcomed. Eventually the Col-
lege wants and plans for a Student Union
with the Student Store, the book store,
a lounge, grill, soda fountain, Bowiing al-
leys and possibly a cafeteria combined for
greater convenience and service to the
student body. .

—In the meantime the Student Store
hopes to make a fair profit by selling its
goods at not more than standard prices
and less wherever possible. In the past
the profits of the Store (if any) have
been turned over to the Athletic Associa-

- For the present, though, as long as there
is a scarcity of basic commodities, all goods
and prices will continue to spiral upward.
For example the major soap manufactur-
ers this past weck announced a 50% in-
crease in the price of soap if and when

available.

Thank you for your continued interest
in the Stud. We both want, I am sure to
have the best store possible and to be the
greatest service possible to the Student
Body and Davidson. Please feel free to ask
us about any policy or price at any time.

BY BOB RIERSON

Orville Leland McPeabody is an
ideal exemplification of Davidson

7] football spirit in the grandstands.

ile is_a paragon of virtue at each
and every game, always sitting di-
iewtly in the middle of the student
rection so as to attract attention
to himself from the alumni and
‘uns as an average member of the
Davidson student body, 1946-417, It
ix trom him that the old grads form
urcir opinions of present day Wild-
cat inanners, customs, behavior, and
wit. Since he is perpetually the
most obtrusive spectator ata game,
or any other event, for that mat-
ter, no one looks any further for
a better example, McPeabody com-
pletely overshadowing all camers.

Wis latest, and—probably best;
performance was at last Saturdagis
football fracas in Charlotte. Da-
vidson Was playing a Tire, though
losing, game on the tield, and
‘(drville kept his spirit ‘up to its
highest pitch, despite the apparent
blackness of the situation. His ef-
fervescent enthusia$m thoroughly
affected all about him-—in one way
or another. Even the Freshmen
looked to him“as a model, and the
cheer leaders could always depend
on_-his yelling at just-the wrong
‘moment. While the play was on,
he engaged in numerous deroga-
‘tory remarks concerning the coach-
ing, the quarterbacking, and the
playing of the Wildcats. He plunged
his auditors into eales of laughter
| when he threw out such marvelous-
ly witty cracks as. “Why don’t you
wnys go back-to-high—school
“Next time maybe you'll learn how
to play ball before you yet out
en the fieid.” | Fruly this man te
far and above the average student
in his loyal support of alma.mater!
But his best moments cane al hall-
time when he went right along with
old tradition in razzing the beauti-
ful performance of The Citadel’s
magnificent_silent, drill team. Of
course Orville knew that the drill
was perfectly executed; that silence
was. supposed to be observed, even

ote

+—or

of its kind as he would ever have
the privilege to see. But he .was
not swayed by the true nature of
the art. He upheld the old and re-
vered theory that the visiting team
is ‘always to be hissed and booed
at every opportunity, incliding any
halftime shows that it might put
on, He onee more assumed his role
as Mr. Davidson Spirit and pro-
ceeded to hurl witticisms like thun-
derbolts at the cadets on the field.
ilis uproarious humor sounded out
at the precise moments when every-
one else was silent so that all pres-
ent could profit, by his profound
and perfect example. He most cer-
tainly \provided. the alumni with
ample proof that Davidson Spirit
has not died but on -the contrary
has become even more fervent and
Joval—_than—in—the- days—of. yore.
After the cadets left the field and
the Davidson band came on, he was
not daunted, but instead only dipped
deeper into his treasure of epithets
and came up with more happy ob-
servations on the quality of the
hand’s\ performance,

T thought it necessary to bring
McPeabody to the attention of the
Davidson student body in case there
ave some unlucky few who have
not had the pleasure of witnessing
his magnanimous displays during
recent weeks. Surely no one could
do wrong by patterning his conduct
after that of this man who repre-
cents wthe irends of the Davidson
chool spirit in these glorious post-
woirdays.—One afternoon near him
in a football stadium is more con-
vincing of the spirit at the college
than any number of publicity re-
leases.. Through. Orville. and_ his
coutuct the alumni of tthe school
cei set the progression of things
: the hill, In Orville fans who
are not alumni but who know of
Yavidson's good sportsmanship and
Snored reputation can see their
expectations realized. . It is witty,
benevolent, spirited Orville, the per-
feet sportsman, who upholds the

y

ras—to—applauding, until. the drill
wax over; that he himself could
not have mastered the same drill
in such a fine manncr though he
tried all his life; and that this same
dill was as superb an exhibition

Davidson traditions, and = after

t whom we all must pattern ourselves
in order to spread the good name
and Famed spirit of our school over
the entire South, and eventually,
the nation.

This was another in a long series
of dealing week ends for old Delta
Chapter. The brothers had a fine
and festive week end starting off
with “Make a nickle” Ennett, who
drove to Montreat to data Juliette.
The “Tie’ McDonald and “Lewd”
|Lawson_and_some of the brothers
made a “Volley Campaign” up to
Woodberry and points north.
— “Hell-driver” Love and his co-
pilot L. Keesler cruised all over
the state from Salem to Duke-
Carolina by way of Charlotte with
operations based in Greensboro.

Off to Charlotte went “Silent”
Cam and “Slick” Sutherland, while
“Lover” Wall went to High Point.
We couldn’t miss “Rigid” Robert
Phillips taking off for home ih a
great hurry in company sith..“Q”
McArn, “Fibula” Kelly, “Smiling”
Suggs and ‘Gorrupt”. Kennett also
took in the Queen City.

The pledges came through in fine

fashion at the game and in Char-

lotte=led by “Neck” Walker,
“Rowdy” Roddy, and “Awful”
Archibald. .

All agree at the “House on the
Corner” that it was another real
deal, a fine affair, and a swell week
end,

Thanksgiving, naturally, is the

the Knights will be at home to cele-
brate Turkey Day. One. traitor to

“Welcome guests over the week

Thomasville, Ga. Another pair,

DuPre Lyles, brother of Pledge
John Lyles, and Boots Fuller, Both
are students at Univ. of S. ©. and
DuPre is a pledge in the Rho Chap-
ter of KA.

Mrs. Thompson served a delicious
Thanksgiving meal Monday eve-
ning at the “Combine”.

S.A.E,

It’s a founded and verified fact
that Brother Hodgins was on the
campus Sunday afternoon and he
says, after being questioned as to
his motive, “There is every bit as

much enjoyment to be had on the}

campus and, goodness sake, I can’t
understand why all the fellows
want to leave on the week erids.”
Possibly Brothers Strickland and
McGeachy can throw more light on
the subject when all is told about
what happened at the El Morocco.

Brothers and Pledges began their
Chapel Hill pilgrimage as early in
the week as Wednesday with some
returning by Monday and others

his ticket for the game at a new

Most of the Brothers and Pledges
could have been found at Queens
with the Kappa Delta sorority Sat-
urday night. It seems everybody
had a fine time. Pledge Houck
was bélow the border to see his true
love. From the big smile on his

again. Seen at the game Saturday

over the week end. Brother Wil-

at the Broadway. It was nice hav-

HURRY BACK! “We were all glad
to -have Pledge —Brother Charlie

‘BETA THETA PI
Almost everybody took off this
week end, some more so than others,
but everyone . mighty  close-
mouthed about the whole thing. |
However, a few choice morsels have
been picked up here and there. La-
mar Williamson showed his true
Davidson spirit by taking his date
to the Christian Youth Service in
Charlotte after the game Saturday.
Undoubtedly he was trying to build
up her confidence in his “honorable”
intentions. Schmidt went up to
Salem to cut in on the territory
otherwise occupied by McConnell,
Gunn, ‘and Rapp’s roommate. With
his charm, good looks, and (quit
twisting my arm, Cal) personality;
he of course had no difficulty ac-
complishing his mission. With him
went_his equally charming (if I
don't say this, who will?) room-
mate, Vinson, who dated Mary
Louise White much to the conster-
nation and against the better judg-
ment of her brother, Gib. Upchurch,
Scruggs, and Ellington just return-
-ed from Chapel Hill where they
were right royally entertained by
the brothers of Eta chapter.
Congratulations are due Brother

is

Cfeatures

Stukes for his fine job of broad-
casting the game.

SIGMA PHI EPSILON

The past week end resulted in
a rather “large” time for several
Sig Eps in Davidson’s suburb to
the south. Seen around and about
the streets at various and sundry
times were Brothers Robinson,
Lamar, and Blevins, ably assisted
by Brother L. Sellers serving in the
capacity of care taker. Perhaps
he could have served in this posi-
lion for Brothers Herndon and
Owens who have been commuting
for the past week. Someone is also

needed-to look after Brother “Mer=—

curichrome” Neill who has been
frequenting the lake shores.

It’s’ Brother “Stetson” Winches-
ter from now on. Brother Barr
inherited the title of “Hell Driver”

a

from Brother Abernathy with his -

record breaking, fender denting,
ubilities. Brother “W. T." or “L.
A’ Powell, it seems, can’t wait
for a fair maid, but: has her meet
him here before the game. The

vole of diplomat was aptly played

on the Winthrop campus by -Pledge—-—

Brother Scruggs.

APRA ALPHA
Monday morning as we had start-
ed down to the Pika house to read
the more intellectual of our month-
ly magazines. such as Film Fun,
Esquire, Caranaval Show, Sunshine

and Health, and Body Beautiful, |

ete., we 1an into Brothers Turner,
Hadley, Hart, Dixon, and Ander-
son playing cops and robbers be-
hind the house. Not quite under-
standing what was going on we
continued on in to the house where
we found Brother Clyde Stroup
juggling tennis balls while Taylor
Leonard walked a tight rope across

the chapter room. —As we happened~

to gaze onto the lawn we saw there
some of the dignified seniors Broth-
ers Smoak, Clark, Rogers, and
Shélton having a hot game of
marbles on the front lawn. Broth-
ers Wood, Wester, Dockery, Sum-
ner, and Ensign were-engaged in
a game of Old Maids in the living
room while Brothers Bell, Raynal,
Bob Stroup, Gibbs, Jackson, and
some of the pledges were shooting
craps behind the altar, Finding

this too much we walked out,-
slammed the front door, lit our’
opium pipes, called a cab, and con-.

tinued on our merry way.
