Educational Quality

A typical, small, liberal arts
college could cut instructional
costs dramatically without re-
ducing educational quality ac-
cording to economists Howard
R. Bowen and Gordon K. Doug-
lass of the Claremont Colleges.

They also found that such a
college could undertake ‘‘bold
educational experimentation”
Within economic constraints
that were placed upon it.

The results were based upon
manipulation of different vari-
ables within a model drawn up
from the study of 20 different
liberal arts colleges. Among
the variables considered were

Smith Preserves Tradition

Over Wide Range Of Verse

A REVIEW
By FRANK SOOS

Staff Writer

William Jay Smith is not an
acid pect, an ethnic poet or a
revolutionary poet. He’s more
of a poet's poet. Smith, a
writer well-versed in his field,
is both critic and translator, to
compliment his own accomplish-
ments as a poet.

Currently writer in residence
at Hollins, Mr. Smith is what
most followers of modern poetry
would call a traditionalist. That
is to say that many of his
poems rhyme and all have very
strong rhythm. One of his ear
lier poems, ‘Quail in Autumn,”
features very tight verbal con-
struction. Every word means
something, every phrase work-

ed and reworked to present just
the precise meaning.

More representative of — his
later work is “What” Train
Will Come?” This poem is much
longer and leaves tight preci-
sion in favor of rapidly rushing
imagry. Words stack up on top
of one another to form scenes
of desolate America. Yet in
this very modern poem, strength
lies on the powerful rhythm as
it falls on the ear.

What is this Smith them? He
is simply a poet. He works to
capture feeling in verse. Each
poem is somewhat different as
is each idea He is not burden
ed by the gimmicry of style:
he only uses form to present
his verbal images.

Mr. Smith also takes us back

to the “compleat” poet. His

62 Freshmen Applications
Submitted For NC Feliows

By DAVID ARANT
Staff Writer

A record-breaking 62 fresh-
men made applications for the
North Carolina Fellows Pro-
grim before the deadline Tues-
day.

The number of applications
was up from 28 applications
last year, Kelton said. He at-
tributed this to the increased
publicity this year.

The applications will now
have to be processed by the
faculty members in the pro-
gram and the present N. C.
Fellows who will interview all
of the applicants.

Each applicant will take a
two and a half hour test series
which include personality and
intelligence tests. The applica-
tions and the student’s school
record will be reviewed. Thirty
Students will be selected to go
to Montreat the weekend of
Dec. 3, 4, and 5 for interviews
and other activities, Kelton
said. Twelve to 15 students will
then be selected fellows.

When asked what they were
looking for in the applicants,
Kelton said, ‘“‘We are interested
in the student who is willing to

devote time and energy to de-
velop his leadership capacity.”

Kelton said that the N. C. Fel-
lows Program gives the Fel-
lows ‘‘a chance to develop per-
sonally.” The program sponsors
self-development seminars and
has trained leaders to conduct
these seminars. The Fellows are
also offered personal vocational
counseling.

Another aspect of the N. C.
Fellows Program is the sum-
mer internship where the Fel-
low may secure a job in some
field that interests him. “The
program helps him with con-
tacts and finance, if necessary,
to have a meaningful internship
relationship,” Kelton said.

verses range from the pastoral,
to the dramatic, to the comic
and .nonsensical. All this be-
cause he feels these emotions,
every one of them.

Needless to say Mr. Smith has-

not been affected by that pic-
ture he carries with him of the
dreamy-eyed poet. He is more
concerned with relating all as-
pects of life rather than taking
the possible position of a fur-
row-browed poet of death.

To complete this amazing
Writer's credentials, he has also
published a book of children’s
poetry. Or to be more accurate,
a book of poems that parents
can read to their children and
sneakily enjoy more them-
selves. There are certainly some
words in there that I didn’t
know when I was eight.

The writer’s stay at Davidson
centered more on the problems
of writing poetry rather than
on Smith's poetry. He used his
work to exemplify his ideas on
how to make a poem.

Talking on subjects related to
the mechanics of poetry is put-
ting one’s self out on a limb.
The Davidson audience was
content to leave Mr. Smith out
on his limb waiting patiently
to be entertained rather than
making any effort to come to
the author’s aid with a timely
question or two.

The only real reading was
attended chiefly by a crowd of
local high school students. But
our writer made the best of it
by reading his best comic poet-
ry. All were pleased with the
possible exception of the poet
who could have wondered just
what students in a liberal arts
college do in their spare time.

teaching loads, plant utilization,
total enrollments, and the num-
ber of students per class.

The hypothetical college had
1200 students, 100 faculty and
an average class size of 20. Fa-
culty compensation averaged
$14,000. Based on a moderate
teaching load and curriculum,
the instructional costs were set
at $240 for each student en-
rolled in each course.

Bowen and Douglass com-
puted their moderate figures on
a teaching load heavier than
that of the average Davidson
teaching load, approximately 28
hours of instruction a week.

One of the initial cost savers
pointed out is a concentrated
instructional program with one-
fourth of all instruction con-
densed into eight lectures.

In addition to measuring the
economic benefits of tradition-
al, conventional tecahing meth-
ods, primarily lectures and
light independent study, Bowen
and Douglass calculated  in-
Structional costs in a series of
experimental te aching pro-
grams. They found that costs
could be kept within accepta-
ble limits.

Bowen and Douglass devised
an eclectic plan, combining a
series of experimental teaching
methods with more traditional
methods and found that it cost
“significantly less’ than the
conventional plan.

In their plan, which they re-
commend be adopted, 35 per
cent of the teaching would be
done conventionally, 25 per cent
in special large lectures, 15 per
cent in programmed independ-
ent study, 15 per cent in tutor-
ials, and ten per cent in ma-
chine aided independent study.

The cost of the recommended
program represented a savings
of eight and one half per cent
over their hypothetical model.

Although Davidson does not
currently employ any but the
traditional method to any great
extent, the college is moving
in the direction of increased in-

dependent study through the
junior year programs _ both
abroad and at other American
schools. The language labora-
tory offers potential for the ex-
pansion of programmed inde-
pendent study in language, par-
ticularly in introductory courses.

Bowen and Douglass see both
danger and promise in apply-
ing economics to college ad-
ministration.

“Many of the allegations
about inefficiency are based on
the narrow conception that the
sole function of colleges and
universities is instruction, and
assume assembly-line methods
that would be educationally dis-
astrous.

“On the other hand we be-
lieve that most colleges and
universities have not had strong
incentives to improve efficiency,
that they are staunchly resist-
ant to change, and that it might
be possible over a period of
years to offset a modest part
of rising costs by improvements
in efficiency.”
