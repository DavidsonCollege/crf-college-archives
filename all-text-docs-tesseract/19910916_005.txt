Rites of Passage: |
Freshmen Seek The Promised Land With A Little Help from Yahweh (Not)

Dear Freshpeople:

For many of you, the events of |
this coming Friday will seem like,
an answer to your prayers. Some
3:01 zealotin your ranks will figu-
ratively part the untrodden waters
behind the Commons, and you,
and others in your midst, will come
to see The Light, The Promised
Land, PATTERSON COURT.

As a fraternity member and as
someone who has thoroughly en-
joyed Patterson Court since my
firstdays there, I feela little strange
saying that I regard the date Sep-
tember 20th with mixed emotions.
ButI do. Asahall counselor, Iam
a little sad that our five-week pe-
riod as almost singular hall units is
coming to a close. But you’re
ready to move on, I know, I know.
So before youembark on your pas-
sage to The Promised Land, here
are a few things that are worth
pointing out:

Patterson Court is not the end
all, be all of the Davidson social
life. While the Court offers a lot in
the way of social interaction, the
College Union is a great social
outlet for all types of people, re-

gardless of an affiliation to any
single house. People who do not
take advantage of the Un-

Self-selection, as a policy, is

something you need to understand.

Donotthink thatindependents

are only friends with other inde-

pendents, or that house

ion’s varied programming
arereally selling themselves
short.

It is ridiculous to think
that you must join a house.

It is equally ridiculous
to think that youmust not, or
cannot, or ought not join a
house.

Keep an open mind. No
one, but no one should have
already made the decision
as to which house to join. If
you think you might like to
self-selecta house, give each
house an opportunity to
show you what they’re all
about. If you don’t, you
might always wonder, what
if...

If a sophomore, junior,
or senior tries to stereotype
houses for you, they’re not
doing you any favors. You

Andrew Spainhour

members are only friends
with members of that same
house. Davidson’s social
scene is truly remarkable in
that itaffords people the op-
portunity to befriend
WHOMEVER, and since
most parties are open to ev-
eryone, you can hang out
with your friends WHER-
EVER.

Get to know as many
peopleas youcan, and don’t
limit your interest in people
to their status as independ-
ent or house member.

Stick by your old friends.
Not all of you will do the
same things come January.

Don’t abandon your fresh-
man hall. If tumbleweed
blows through the hall on
weekends, your hall coun-
selor might go into an irre-

need to judge all things for
yourself (including, of
course, whether or not to listen to
my advice in these matters).

Don’tbe afraid to ask how it works,
and be aware that it is not all that it
may seem.

Way Beyond Birkenstock |

By J. Kyle Kinner

You know, I wentto Washing-
ton in order to live deliberately. In
order to front only the essential
facts of life, and see if I could not
learn what they had to teach, and
not, when I came to die (probably
in some gun battle), discover that I
had not lived.

Not.

I went to Washington in order
to pad my resume with what I as-
sumed would be an easy journey
into crib land, and see if I could not
spend an entire semester in slack,
and not, when I came to graduate;
discover that I had been wait-listed.
at six law schools (as, no doubt,
some of you seniors are already
discovering). Well, so much for
my assumptions.

“Welcome to Hell, Mr. Kin-
ner. Here‘s your map of the D.C.

But, then again, even Dante
had some fun. Wait a minute! I
think I‘m having a flashback (not
LSDrelated). Yes... 1 remember
‘it as if,it were today (probably
because it was today). Anyway, as
I propped my loafer-clad feet on
my desk at National Republican
Congressional Committee head-
quarters, I gazed expectantly atmy
private phone and awaited the
President‘s call. And awaited. And
awaited. And finally it was time
for lunch, so I took my loafers off
the desk and strode purposefully
past the grinning picture of Dan

~ Quayle on the wall by the elevators
(Washington insider: He really is
as smart as you‘ve heard.) With
Lincolnesque determination |
reached forward and pressed . .
down.
Alright, maybe the first morn-

ing wasn‘ta day in the life of James
Baker, but I did get to pay six-fifty
for a grilled chicken on rye and a
glass of tea (no refills), ina restau-
rant where I am sure famous people
occasionally dine. Not.that I saw
any, mind you.’ Nor ‘have I seen
many of what you mightrefer to as
“notable Republicans”. I hear the
Democrats among you cackling
about “notable Republicans” being
a contradiction in terms, but it’s
true, ‘there are a couple, none of
whom I saw.

Oh well, I‘ll await the Presi-
dent's call tomorrow (lacking any
defined duties), and maybe we'll
have lunch (grilled chicken and a
tea).' And then I‘ll tell him my
plans for selling our toxic waste to
previously Soviet republics in
exchange .. for food credits (it‘s
going to be a long winter, com-
rade); eventually he‘ll make me
and powerful. But don‘t worry, I
won‘t forget to trickle down on the
little people, such as yourselves.
Now.won‘t that be nice?

Of course I‘m not serious. If I
ever do reach such a position of
fame and power, I promise to
remain the same humble, sensitive
type of individual you've come to
associate with this column. So
don‘t worry. In fact, in the words
of the late, great JFK (whose eter-
nal flame is located near my pala-
tial residence): “Ask not whatI can
do for you, but what you can do for
me.”

One of the benefits of working
at Republican HQ, besides the
almost daily cocktail buffet, is the
big barrel of cash marked “Federal

Savings and Loan: Free Samples.”

That is an exaggeration, of course.
Those of you who think the Re-
publicans are the party of the rich

should come take a look at the
main third floor conference room.
It's about the size of your dorm
room; and I know for a fact that
most of you have better media
centers than we do. Don‘t you feel
proud, knowing you live better than
the governing executive party of
the most powerful nation onearth?
Better you should remedy this
horrible oversight. Apparently this
little operation is privately funded,
which means that if youactRIGHT
NOW, you too can help support
the party of Lincoln, Reagan, and
Myrick. In fact, send in your de-
ductible donation (deduct it from
your bank account, ‘cause youcan‘t
take it off your tax return), and
we'll send you a Commemorative
Federal Receipt, handsomely
styled and suitable for. framing.
But only if you act RIGHT NOW!

But enough of this shameful
parties are especially good at). So
what else is new? Well, let's see.
The Judiciary Committee has Jus-
tice-designate Thomas over the
coals, and the opening salvo sug-
gests he might do well to invest in
some fire-retardant Brooks Broth-
ers suits. Because of early dead-
lines, I‘ve only seen the first day‘s
highlights, but it looks as though

Thomas‘ handlers (what exactly .

do they handle anyway?) have
coached him pretty thoroughly.
The man can dodge a question as
well as Souter, and he apparently
learned the terrible Bork impera-
tive: DON‘T PISS ‘EM OFF. So!
predict a partisan split, a jump to
the whole Senate, and relatively
easy passage. But guess what? It
doesn‘treally matter anyway. This

versible depression. If for

no other reason than to make your
hall counselors feel useful, make a
concerted effort to stay involved

with your hall. It’s worth it.

Don’ tthink that massive drink-
ing and massive drinking alone
impresses people. If youcan drink
ten beers and still operate heavy
farm machinery, well, that’s just
great. But if you drink ten beers
and end up in your roommate’s
closet wearing only a laundry bag,
it’s time to embrace a little respon-
sibility. Yakking off the back porch
of houses every night or drinking
until an ambulance comes does not
classify you as “cool”. Really.

Never feel that you may not fit
in to a certain niche. You fit in
wherever you allow yourself to
feel comfortable.

Don’t let Patterson Court rule
your life. Go to the 900 Room, see
a movie, catch up on some sleep,
do your homework, take your hall
counselors to the James Taylor
concert, or just hang out with the
hall. Get involved.

Be yourself. Be yourself. Be
yourself.

And, of course, have fun in
whatever you may choose to do.

Scribblings

The dating season officially
began this past weekend with
Warner Hall ladies (or chicks as
real men refer to them) inviting a
select few men from around
campus to attend their illustrious
“Steak ‘n’ Date.” In actuality, the
gamesreally began at Davidson’ s

perennial powerhouse, Clinch
Valley, and a rousing good time
was had by all. (For several of us
who “chose” not to attend either
