Poll Shows Congress Against Draft

A poll taken by the Christian Sclence Monitor
last week showed that about two out of every three
congressmen answering the poll favored an all-volun-
teer army.

However, almost everyone also said that he doubt-
ed that the measure would be passed at the present
time. About half of each house answered the poll.

Most of the Congressmen also said that they be-
lieved that the draft laws ought to be modified. Collage
deferments of some kind were popular.

A nationwide poll of citizens by the same paper
showed that 62 percent of those polled favored con-
tinuance of the draft in some form.

of setting up the program has discovered a total of
67 courses relevant to Afro-American studies.

A similar program is under consideration ai the
University of North Carolina at Greenaboru, but the
chairman of the History Department at UNCG said
that lack of student interest had so fat prevented the
tory Department from offering a course in black

Enthusiasm-Based Education Begun

Students at Vanderbilt have set up a free univer-
sity, named the Free University of Nasbville (FUN).

“The rationale (of the is that andividuals
must take responsibility for their own education, 2
process that requires participants to define what they
want to learn,” FUN's catalogue stated,

“The enthusiasm is that learning [s a free expres-

sion of self, a dialogue with others, and « means to .

a better undertsanding of the world,” it continued.
Black Recruiting Program Praised

Recruitment of black students by members of the
Afro-American Society at Dickinson College has been
“extremely pleasing” to members of the admissions
staff at Dickinson.

Black students go along with members of the
admissions staff to high schools having « high per-
centage of blacks, write personal letters ‘0 hlack appli-
cants and assisi in bringing black applicants tor cam-
pus visits.
