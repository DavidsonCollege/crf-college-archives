The Bavihsanias

Possible Departure

Of Lefty Rumored

Rumors concerning the de-
parture of Lefty Driesell.
Davidson’s head basketball
coach, continue to spread de-
spite the refusal by Driesell
himself to verify his depar-
ture.

According to usually accu-
rate sources, at least three
large universities. all in the
Atlantic Coast Conference,
have shown great interest in
Driesell and have offered
him the position of head
basketball coach for next
season.

Reportedly, the first school
to approach the Wildcat
coach was Clemson, which
has already given indica.
tions that present head coach
Bobby Roberts will be kick-
ed upstairs in the athletic
department after a very dis-
mal record this year.

However, by all ‘indica-
tions, Driesell has refused
to take the coaching job at
that school.

Maryland apparently next
contacted Driesell. and as

yet there seems to be no
answer to the Terps from
Lefty. Maryland. although not

ACC standings. is.in a lucra
tive position néar the vast
wealth of high school basket-
ball talent in Washington.
D.C.

It is interesting to note
that if Driesell were to coach
at Maryland. his first star
would be center Will Hetzel.
the younger brother of Fred

Hetzel. Driesell’s first All.
American at Davidson.

According to latest reports
from several newspapers, the
third ACC university to con
tact Driesell is Duke, where
Driesell played his collegiate
basketball.

As reported recently in the
Charlotte Observer, Duke's
present head coach, Vic Bu.
bas, has announced that this
will be his last year as
Duke's basketball mentor.

Bubas, one of the nation’s
most successful collegiate
coaches, will reportedly be
come: Vice President of Stu
dent Affairs at Duke.

As Davidson's head coach
since 1960, when he left New-
port News, Va.. High School.
Driesell has won 170 games
while losing only 70. His only
losing season came in his
first year when the Wild-
cats went 9-14.

Six of Driesell’s last seven
teams have won 20 games
or more, while several have
been nationally rated. He
has turned out two All-
Americans, Hetzel and Dick
Snyder, and possibly a third
in Mike Maloy.

Williams’ uniqueness is not

ment.

“The tournament is a very
unfair. way to determine a
conference champion. If Da
vidson were to be beaten it
would be great injustice.

“But whether it's fair or.

net, you can be sure that
Ti be trving to bring that

injustice about.”

fellow grappler said. “The
students there started out on
Ronnie even before the
match started. and when his
turn to wrestle came, they
were giving him all kinds
of hell.

“Then Ronnie went out and
whipped the Duke wrest)-
er all over the mat. Boy, did
that take guts.”

The Duke ‘match. was not
an isolated incident. either.
At VMI, for example, the
Keydets started on Williams
early, only to see him sound.
ly defeat one of their better
wrestlers.

‘Ronnie has gone through
a lot more than a lot of peo.
ple realize." said Davidson
wrestling coach Charlie
Parker. “And with his cour-
age and pride. he never does
tuck his tail between his
legs and hide, but is always
holding his head high.”

As a wrestler, Williams has
done a commendable job.
With just one and a_ half,
year’s experience, Williams
won a starting berth this
season as a freshman in the
167-and 160-pound classes,
and has compiled one of the
best records on the team by
winning five, tying one, and
losing only three.

Williams didn’t wrestle un-
til his family moved to
Fayetteville from New: York
in his junior year of high
school. ‘I didn’t do real well
then, since I had only had
experience on a mat as a
tumbler for the gymnastics
team’ Williams laughingly
recalls.

Then during his senior
year he compiled a 6-1 re-
cord before leaving the team
to help with family finances.

“Ronnie has a great deal
of natural ability in wrestl-
ing.’ Parker said: “He is
by far my best freshman
wrestler and is one of the
better men on the team.

“Ronnie's biggest pro
Blem seems to be that he still
uses his strength more than
his head. With a little more
experience and practice he'll
become a fine wrestler.”
Parker concluded.

Williams complictely agrees
with his coach's criticism.
“I'd say my main trouble
is that whenever I get on top
of my opponent. I don't
know just what to do with

him: he chuckles.
Williams jokmaly. . refers
lo himself as the “Great

Black Hope of the Davidson
Wrestling Team." “I really
hope to do everything I enn
in the neat four vears to

help this team,’ he promis-
ed.

“I have all the respect. in
the world for Coach Parker,’
Williams commented. -**He’s
a great coach, as anyone
who knows anything about
wrestling can tell you."

“The rest of the guys: on
the team are great. too.
Many of my closest friends
wrestle with me on the team.
I think our team unity helps
a lot.’

Williams views the racial
prejudice he has seen philo-
sophically. ‘‘Sometimes it’s
really bad and it hurts, but
you don't accomplish any-
thing by running away from.
it. I just hope that I never

become apathetic towards
it.”

Viewing the wrestling
team, Williams sees the

chance for a big improve
ment over the 3-6 record
that grapplers have obtained
so far this year.

“We have only two seniors
on the squad, and several of
us are green freshmen like
myself,"" he said. *‘Besides,
Coach Parker is doing a
good job recruiting. We have
nowhere to go but up.”

The two seniors on the
team are captain Kerry
Keith, the Wildcats’ heavy-
weight entry. and Dean
Cromartie, who has the best
record on the team with
only one loss.

‘The team has really done
a good job so far this year.”
Parker commented. ‘‘I didn't
think that we'd win. more
than two matches.

“If we get the boys that
I'm trying to recruit now
for next year. we'll have a
good team.”

And if the wrestlers get
many more students like
Ronnie Williams, Davidson
may have a great team.

A Worn-Out Net Or A Bucket Of Tears

This, friends, is the Southern Conference tourna-
ment. .
The appearance of such basketball all-time greats
as Hot Rod Hundley, Jerry West, Rod Thorn, Frank
Selvy, Fred Hetzel, and Dick Snyder. The re-appear’:
ance of past conference stars like Gary McPherson.
Warren Mitchell, Lewis Mills, and Selvy as head
coaches.

This is the Southern Conference Tournament.

A long, long season of blood and sweat, hopes
and fears, good and bad breaks, wins and losses, pre-
dictions and upsets, all tried and tested on one gruel-
ing week-end.

This is the Southern Conference Tournament. —

A history of upsets, from Davidson’s losses in
1964 and 1965 to VMI and West Virginia to George
Washington’s surprise championship in 1954 and VMI's
title in 1964.

This is the Southern Conference Tournament.

The preparation of many days and weeks for the
tourney, the guessing and second guessing, the prac-
ticing, conditioning, and griping of one whole year.
The intense rivalries that develop over a year, the
affections and the hates, the friends and foes, all
meeting gn one small floor.

This is the Southern Conference tournament.

Names like Deardorff, Spadafore, Petcavich, and
Kasprzak dot the official program with names like
Smith, West, Burton, Evans, and Armstrong. Pictures
of teams, with big men and small, along with pictures
of cheerleaders, coaches, officials, presidents, and
others crowd out much information in the programs.

This is the Southern Conference tournament.

Located in the Charlotte Coliseum for the sixth
straight year, drawing hundreds of thousands of
screaming fans, some yelling “Go Cats” or “Tear ‘Em
Up Keydets” or “Rip ‘Em Bucs,” some hollering ob-
scenities and insults in the direction of the officials,
the rival teams, and sometimes opposing fans. Once
housed in the small Richmond Arena and the partial
Moutaineer Fieldhouse.

This is the Southern Conference tournament.

The thrills, the glory, the joy, and the cheers for
winning, along with the fears, the disgrace, the sorrow,
and the boos for losing. Hero one night and goat the
next, one moment a genius and the next a bumbling
fool. The ‘wait until next year” statements, the “‘we
should have won it” quotes, the “it’s been a great
year” comments from coaches hiding tears of. either
elation or sorrow.

This is the Southern Conference tournament.

Three grueling nights of contact, exertion, bruises,
exhaustion, and injuries to prove just who is the best.
Six hours of basketball with little rest, six hours of
running, jumping, fighting, and throwing to establish
dominance after a year of unimportant regular season
games. Just six hours to continue or terminate a sea-
son or a collegiate basketball career.

ment,

The last second shots, good and bad, carrying with
them the whole of one basketball season. The high
scorers and the big rebounders, getting the headlines
while the “little man” does the lion’s share of the work.

This is the Southern Conference tournament.

The winners’ prize, a trophy containing a cut-up,
worn-out net. The losers’ award, broken hopes and a
bucketful of tears. .

This is the Southern Conference tournament.

The criticisms following the tournament about the
