Honorary Frats?-?

Supposedly Honorary and Social Pratern-
ities should be of different nature but re-.
cemly, that is cin the last few years, it
seems that the former group. Ilonorary
‘Fraternities; has forgotten their purpose.

What is their purpose?. When I first
entered Davidson, literature and other re-
ports stated that the purpose of their exist-
ente was lo reengnize excellence in eertain
fields and that men who ecxeclied in those
jields, and only those. were cligible for a
certain Honorary lratemity. .-

— lin as. the years go by it seems that
many of our Elonorary Fraternities are ior-
getting the purpose of their cxistence. in-
stead of recognizing execllence in certain -
fields many are merely melting pots tor
polities. Unless a candidate under considera -
tion for membership is a member of some

giants carry a memory jealousy guarded. ~

Exiled forever, with “In Voyage” written
-1n .their league of Nations Nansen pass-
ports, these men pour into songs all their
hopeless longing for their homeland which
must forever remain a memory.
“A performance by the Original Don
Cossack Chorus is a thrilling and never-to-
be-forgotten event.”

| Should Have Been Let Alone

+ In a bare majority of the States,
week will bring Thanksgiving Day by vir-
{tue_of the edict of the President of the
"| United States and the Governors of those
commonwealths who were willing to accept
the changed date.

Fortunately and wisely, Governor Hocy
ot North Carolina was enough of a tra-
ditionist to refuse to truckle.

The people of the State. therefore, will
“continue the eustom of the generations in
observing the last Thursday of the month
instead of the third.

_OF course, it may not make much differ-
_ence which is which in this case, in view
.- ot the fact that the sanetity of the Thanks-
giving. as it was originally conceived and
intended to remain, has just about all oozed
_ out.
lt is’ mostly now a day of pleasure and
recreation, tea far detached, from the ele-
ments of worship and thanksgiving to the
Almighty for the blessings which have
come to the people of this nation which
lormerly were its predoininating fattors.

And the change that has been eclicted
by the President is all the more regreit
ble because of the introduction of the com
inercial imptlse which led ‘up to this move.

Mr. Roosevelt was largely intluenced by

business people who argued that unless che
i changed date were made. there would be
too short a spell between Thanksgiving and
Christmas during which to draw ont the |
holiday trade.

This must be. interpreted. thereiore. to
indicate that the acquisitive spirit has in
this case been awarded the superior place
over the thanksgiving worshipfitl spirit for.

are those that are nationally known, have

w“\ good remedy for Ure situation is to let

Don Cossack Shows

- _One of the wGst splendid singing organi-
zations in the worid will visit our campus -~
in December and students will-be given the
opportunity to hear aad see a musical group
that has reccived high aec:aim wherever it
has appeared sinee its formation in a prison
camp.near Constantinople over 15 years ago._

Recognized by many crities as the great:
est Singing organization of present times,

the Original Don Cassock Chorus hold a

record of more than 4,000 concerts that has

nevér been equaled.
One writer has the following to say
about the Don Cossack chorus: ee

“Millions in Europe, England, Austi

and America have thrilled to these magnifi-

cent voices. ,

“A Don Cossack concert is a memorable
experience. The exultant fervor of their
voices in Russian sacred music, the passion-
ate longing expressed in their folk songs,
and the riotous accompaniment of shouts,
whistling, and-frenzied dancing in their
Cossack war songs makes a program that,
once heard, is never forgotten.

“When you hear them you hear the voice
of Mother Russia—for these battle scarred‘

ity for the LU. S. in the present Heropean_
contlict, collegians are still vigorously de-
bating the issue: The range of opinion is
sO great that a seientifie charting of its
direction is impossible so we will pass on
| to you’ espressions that prove that so iar
\ there. is little unity of thought on the sub-
ject:

Sounding a warning note for the future,
the Dartmouth College Daily Dartmouth’
says: (The cash and carry law is the pro-

‘ duet of two American aims, first that we
should have fegislation which would help
okeep us out of war, second that we should
* have tegistation whieh would help the allies.

The important thing to guard against now

is that we do not allow the latter aim to

grow in importance at the expense of the
| first.”

Praising the new neutrality act, the Har-
vard University Crimson cautions those who
_Will administer it in these words: “The main
~burden ot enlorcing the act is placed upon
the president. He it is who must define
the areas of combat from which our ships
are to be exehaded, ‘and declare what coun-
tries are belligerents. The remaining de-
tails fall in the province of the state depart-__
ment. It is right that these duties should
be placed in the executive branch of the

government, for that is its function. How:

ever, the record of this branch during the
past few months indicates that it will bear
close watching.”

Another view is expressed by the Univers-
ity of Michigan Daily: “The United States
is not neutral. By repealing the arms em-
bargo, it has definitely shown on which side

- of the fence it is. The neutrality act, writ-
)“tén in peace-time, was not intended to aid
any foreign country. By changing its own,
with specific countries involved, we are
certaily behaving in a most un-neutral

-manner.”’- . I

Proceeding in this same vein, the Wheat-
on College Record says that-“the act is
satisfactory enough if the public wants also
to intervene now for England, and to make
European quarrels theirs. In agreeing to
scll those materials which were formerly
contraband, even in the cash and carry basis,
we have sided with the Allies.”
