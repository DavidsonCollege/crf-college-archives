Apartment lottery leaves
most seniors relieved

By Tamara-Kay Tibby

Debbie Sink in the RLO be-
lieves that “there are enough apart-
ments for all the seniors who wa want
them and even for some “Juniors.”

On Wednesday, Residence
Life posted the 1994-95 apartment
assignments. Seniors who com-
pleted the application for an apart-
ment by the February 22 deadline

_ entered phase one. Several seniors
were not confident about the pro-
cess or pleased by its results. Six-
teen four-person apartments re-
main available.

Seniors who were not assigned
an apartment in phase one of the
lottery or who did not complete
their applications on time will be
entered into phase two if theircom-
pleted applications are submitted
to the RLO by March 15.

Arthur Gaston, whose four- ,

person apartment group was suc-
cessful in phase one of the lottery,
did not get his first choice but was

still happy to get one. Because
there were more apartments avail-
able this yearthanin previous years,

“the uncertainty was’ taken out’ of" é

the whole process” for Gaston.
As expected, Martin F, the
new five-person apartment which
will be ready in the fall, was a hot
commodity. Meredith
McCullough and her apartment
mates for next year “decided that
we would try and get the five per-
son apartment and just crossed our
fingers that it would work out. And
it did.” For the majority of next
year’s seniors it did “work out.”
Some seniors were not as con-
fident about the process or as
pleased by its results. Two groups
of five which had applied for
Martin F were not assigned apart-
ments. McCullough and Gaston
are sympathetic because these
groups will either have to drop one

Final Four goes to
Richmond in 1995

By Will Cobb
Davidson suffered its biggest
upset of the year when the NCAA
committee awarded Richmond,
VA, the men’s soccer Final Four
for the years of 1995 and 1996.

- The reason for the decision came

down to money. The Richmond
group guaranteed 17,000 in atten-
dance with the possibility of sell-
ing out the 22,000-seated Munici-
pal Stadium.

Davidson bid with 13,800,
knowing reaching that number
would be difficult. With the quick
success of the weekend event the
last two years, the soccer commit-
tee looks to take the Final Four to
another level in Richmond.

“As the Davidson coach, Iam
disappointed because we would

have loved to put [the Final Four]
on for another couple of years. We |
are flattered that they feel they are
ready tomove,” said Charlie Slagle.

The decision appears hasty
because having the event in Rich-
mond will trade the traditional col-
lege atmosphere for a downtown
location in a rather unsafe part of |
town. In the light of Davidson's
sellout and record attendance last
December, one would feel the
change unnecessary.

“As acollege coach, Iam con-
cerned whether they can do what
they say they can do. If they can’t,

we take a step back. For
[Davidson], we could not do it for
a long term because we made it

PHONATHON

By Jeff Fuller

The SGA is now in the midst
of its annui

Organized through the Develop-
ment Office, the Annual Fund
adds to the college’s annual bud-
get.

Over 350 students partici-
pate in the drive, by spending an
evening calling alumni and
friends of Davidson, encourag-
ing them to contribute. The
Phonathon is held in the Cham-
bers Multi-Purpose Room on five
nights: February 23, 24, 27, 28
and March 1. Each night from 6
to 9 p.m., students representing
fraternities, eating houses, inde-
pendents, and freshmen call ask-
ing for money.

On the first night, the inde-
pendents raised the most money
with $7,790.00. The same night
Kappa Sig raised $4,775.00, and
Phi Delt raised $4,650.00. The
next night Warner Hall raised
$7,260; PiKA raised $5,295.50;
and FIJI raised $1,555.00.

Alumni can ask to givetheir
donations to specific areas of the
fund and leave messages for pro-
fessors.

Sophomore Lylen Ferris, an
independent, noted that the most
positive response came from
“older alums and recent gradu-
ates.” She also remarked that at
one point “we made $3,000 in 5
minutes." Ferris enjoyed partici-
pating in the Phonathon saying
that “it’s a fun, exciting atmo-

mathon to help —
raise money forthe Annual Fund. ©

sphere.”

Junior Dan Nechemias, a
Phonathon committee chairman,
said that “the biggest problem is
it’s hard to reach people in a three-
hour period.” He said that most
called were unable to be reached.

Freshman Jill Stephenson, a
night-chairman for the Phonathon
helped recruit 40 freshman to par-
ticipate. She said that it’s “harder
to get freshmen” because “it sounds
so dull when you hear it.” How-
ever, “everybody’s responded
pretty well considering.”

The Phonathon chairmen--se-
nior' Bailey Foster, Nechemias,
sophomore Rosie Molinary, and
freshman Zik Joseph--spend the
evenings distributing and collect-

ing cards which list information
about the people called.

They also try to create a fun
atmosphere for those working on
the phones. Each time callers get
three donations in a row they get
a balloon and a coupon for a free
ice-cream cone. Other prizes in-
clude tickets for Charlotte Hor-!
nets and Checkers games. Stu-
dents who help out with lad
Phonathon are given a free t-shirt
and five minutes of long distance!
calls to anywhere in the U.S.

Nechemias said “It’s impor-
tant to remember to support the
Phonathon because it does so
much. . . . It’s a little reminder
about how hard people are work-

ing to make this a great place.”
