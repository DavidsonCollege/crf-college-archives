Lieutenant Johnson during the holi-
days left us and is now with the 11th
Infantry at Camp Jackson, in Columbia,
8.C

Sergeant Champ was detailed as color
sergeant to a company in the same camp.

Sergeant Ryan remains at Davidson
and has been promoted to a warrant offi-
cer. He has charge of the duties that
were Lieutenant Johnson’s.

Corporal Otis D. Cameron has arrived

war for nearly a year. His native state
is Arkansas made famous by Thomas

give his native state other fame in his
stay here as Davidson is the incubator
for the government.
soldiers who come here rise in rank be-
fore they leave.

Major Hearn is building a rifle range
out back of the sixth green on the golf
course. The work is slow on account of
the dampness of the ground but it will
soon be completed and the members of
the R. O. T. C. will get a taste of what
the real thing is in warfare. To get a
long range it is necessary to shoot over a
road but as this is not much traveled it
will not be dangerous.

DEATH OF JOHN B.
MALLARD COMES
AS SHOCK TO FRIENDS

Was Promising Young Artist
in Employ of the Presby-
terian Standard.

It was with deepest sorrow and
regret that old Davidson men ev-
erywhere, and present students
who knew him, learned on Decem-
ber 28th of the death of John B.
Mallard, ex-’18. Death came as the
result of an operation following
long suffering of appendicitis.

He was born in Rock Hill, S. C.,
1895, but reared in Lincolnton, N.
C. He received his education at
Davidson College and Washington
and Lee. Then he entered the
First Training Camp at Fort Ogle-
thorpe, from which he was grad-
uated as a second lieutenant. Soon
he was “sent across” and served
the whole period with the Fifty-
second Pioneer Infantry. Return-
ing to the States, he began work
with the Presbyterian Standard,
September 1, 1919, as commercial
artist. While overseas he publish-
ed illustrative sketches under the
title, “With An Artist in the A. E.
F.” This little book won him much
renown as an artist. His ability
with the brush while in college
here was portrayed by his sketch
of Woodrow Wilson on Chambers
building.

Our heartfelt sympathy goes out
to his wife, to whom he was mar-
ried in July, 1918, and to his father
and mother, Mr. and Mrs. John
Mallard.

My dear Dr. Martin:

The Corps Area Inspecting Officer who
recently inspected the R. O. T. C. Unit at
Davidson College spoke in high terms
of the work that is being accomplished
at your institution. The excellent morale
of the Unit and the interest in the work
displayed by its members, and the pre-
cision at drill were especially noted.

The degree of military efficiency ob-
tained by your institution indicated the
zeal of the Army personnel and your
strong personal co-operation and assist-
ance by members of the faculty, all of
which is absolutely ‘essential for the
success of the Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps.

The need of an additional officer at
your institution is appreciated, and every
eftort is being made to find a qualified
officer who is available for detail with
the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.

T¢ affords me pleasure to have the op-
portunity to express my satisfaction in
the work being accomplished and my
hearty appreciation of the interest and
co-operation of yourself and members
of the faculty.

Very truly yous,
(s) J. F. MORRISON,
Major General, U. S. A.

CLASS FOOTBALL.

For the past few years class football
has been eliminated for various reasons.
Last year each class was represented
by a team; practice has begun and
everything was moving smoothly when
the “flu” came and the schedule had to
be canceled. This year it is hoped that
nc such epidemic will visit the campus.

There is abundant material in each
class and the men who were not for-
tunate enough to be awarded letters
will have an excellent chance to star in
these games. Looking over the pros-
pects of the respective teams it seenis
that there is going to be a “battle royal”
for the championship. No team is go-
ing to have an easy time winning the
title.

Class games are not played solely for
the purpose of determining which class
is the winner, but also to promote good
feelings among the classes, and to
develop varsity material.

The teams have elected their managers
and a schedule will soon be made out
and published. Practice will start at
once and everyone is urged to come out
whether he has had any experience or
not.
