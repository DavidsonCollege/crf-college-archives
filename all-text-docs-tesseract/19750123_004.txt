Goal Reaching

Although we support President Spencer’s move to
establish a goals committee to help determine
priorities for the college, we recognize that our first
priority is fund raising. i

Until we have a commitment from the president of

the college to seek more actively outside funds for
Davidson, a goals committee is no more than a paper
‘lion.
. In a memo to certain faculty and staff members,
the president has attempted to pit groups seeking art
facilities against groups seeking improved chemistry
facilities. If this is a maneuver to discredit one
priority for the sake of the other, we don’t buy it.

There is no reason that an institution such as David-
son should deprive the community of either of these
two structures or many of the other facilities and
programs ranking high on our priority list.

President Spencer maintains that every act he per-
forms is one of fund raising. While we appreciate his
cognizance that public relations is a vital aspect of his
position, we agree with the Self-Study report asser-
tion that at least half of those public relations acts in-
clude applying for grants and soliciting new money
for Davidson.

We stand solidly. behind Vice President for Develop-
ment Craven Williams and his entire staff in their
work to solicit funds. We further support plans to in-
crease the size of our present development staff.

At a time when the national economic picture is not
particularly conducive to fund raising, we must make
Annual Fund Director James McFarland’s asser-
tion, ‘Sometimes adversity brings out the best in Day
the reality of our,finance campaign.

Yet we recognize that the leading role in soliciting
new funds centers in the office of the president.

We call upon Dr. Spencer to increase his personal
commitment and activity in this area. His proposal
for establishment of a goals committee is sound and
much appreciated, but the question as to whether this

committee will have the teeth of a lion or the worth of

tear-drenched toilet tissue depends solely on his
direction of a financial program that leaves this com-
mittee options.

We,have no place for a paper lion;- we need an
aggressive animal with teeth.

By Our Own Admission

What justifications are provided for the policies
which Director of Admissions and Financial Aid H.
Edmunds White executes?

White is not sure how much money will be needed to
fund the 1975-76 financial aid program. Yet, he is'sure
that a significant number of substantial need ap-
plicants will not be admitted in the Class of ’79.

Dr. Spencer states that a financial aid program can
operate in one of two ways. It can attempt to meet the
full need of a limited number of students or the partial
need of a greater number. How has Davidson made
this decision? |

In many U.S. colleges, the financial aid and ad-
missions offices are manned by different staffs. At
Davidson, admissions decisions are not made. until
the Parents’ Confidential Statement of income is also
analyzed. eR

According to our college administrators, the struc-
ture of any financial aid program is grounded on
various value assumptions.

We need to know what these assumptions are. No
responsible evaluation of admissions and financial
aid policies can be made until the relevant issues are
openly discussed.

nresolved Issues Face Senate

After Semi-Successful Year

The past year has witnessed a
large number of students con-
tributing a vast amount of time
toward many student govern-
ment endeavors.

I personally have relied to a
great extent on persons outside
the structure of the Senate,
because I have frequently found
that other people have had
strong convictions and greater
energies, especially in the areas
of academic reform, campus
planning, and community
problems.

Looking back on the year, I
must question the wisdom of
that decision a bit, because I
now see a Senate which has not
realized its fullest potential and
which is losing its identity.

This is one area where I

challenge the new SGA
President to do a better job.
We have, however, ac-

complished a good deal during
the past year- much of obvious
import and some not so ap-
parent. Considering the fact
that the students and the Senate
possess little real ‘‘power,” I
am pleased with what has been
done.

We have made major strides
(hiring a clinical psychologist,
an honor campaign with the
Hearing Committee, approval
for beer sales on campus, a new
registration process, new plans
for the Grey Union, long range
calendar plans, a new proposal
for the physical education
requirement, and continued
support for the Departmental
Advisory Committees) as well
as lesser victories (this year’s
calendar change, 5¢ Xeroxing,
car pooling to the airport. )

We have brought to campus
the .President of the National
Student Association’ and the
Executive Director of the

National Student Lobby. We
have affiliated Davidson with
both of these organizations,

We have contributed a colos-
sal amount of time, energy, and
vigorous discussion into David-
son’s Institutional Self-Study
and into a complete overhauling
of the By-laws which govern the
Student Government
Association.

The Senate has transcended
its political mold by financially
supporting the activities of the
Outing Club, the APO
Bookstore, the Davidson
Christian Fellowship, the
YM/WCA Youth Center, the
Cheerleading Squad and the
Debate Team.

But the year has been far
from utopian for student ef-
forts. We failed to obtain an op-
tional laundry fee. We failed to
see any new student housing,
erected or intended. The drop-
add period is still only 6 days
long and there is no means for a
student to eradicate an “F”’
from his transcript. Night
exams have been tabled,. the
Centrex telephone system
remains unresolved and no
visible progress has resulted
from our cries to improve
housing in the community of
Davidson. ‘

The single major area of ac-
tivity during the past year
which I consider to be most im-
portant is our efforts to
delineate student rights at this
college.

The controversy over the
yearbook this fall and the enact-
ment of the ‘“‘Buckley Amend-
ment”’ regarding the release of
student records have pinpointed
a question first raised by the
reorganization of our campus
governance structure over the
past 4 years, and that is: What
rights, responsibilities, and

Butner Serves Davidson

To the Editor:

Most Davidson seniors have
seen five SGA presidents in of-
fice and four of them in action.

Of the four perhaps the one
who has~- had the least
recognition, the least applause,
and the most effect is the im-
mediate past president, Blain
Butner. ie

For the first time in over
three years the SGA president
pursued the realization of
student rights.

Blain labored for these rights
within the Trustee Governance

Committee and during campus
episodes such as the censorship
issues.

Too often have people smugly
decided that to love Davidson is
to let it stand as it is. Blain has
wisely shown us that to love this
place constructively means to
criticize it and find ways of im-
proving it.

This attitude and Blain’s term
will serve as a good model for
future campus leaders.

privileges do the students of
Davidson College possess--
inherently, legally, and granted
by the college-- and how can we
guarantee the future protection
of these rights?

Since October there has been
vigorous discussion in this area
and we are attempting to
delineate the rights and respon-
sibilities in a Student Bill of
Rights.

‘We must unite to see this
statement approved by the end
of the academic year in a
document accepted by the
faculty, administration, and
Trustees. That day will be
historic for students and one
which we must witness.

The saddest thing to me about
the past year is that we have
been unable to get the college as
a whole to realize that the
Davidson of 1970 will not serve
the Davidson of 1980.

It has been a full two and a
half years since Davidson com-
mitted itself to coeducation and
a student enrollment increased
by 500. Yet since that time we
have constructed no new
Student housing; no new
chemistry, biology or. fine arts
facilities; miniscule additions
to the gymnasium; and we have
suffered the 24 years with a
painfully deficient college union
building.

I’m afraid that this is an all
too apt example of an oc-
currence which is all too
frequent: namely, the students
are being made to suffer for the
lack of administrative plan-
ning.

We are the ones whose social
life has been curtailed. We are
the ones studying in antiquated
science facilities. And we are
the ones- cramped for housing
space.

I can only temper my dismay
with bitterness, because we as

- students have been urging and

planning for campus expansion
since 1972, and the Ad-
ministration has been dragging
its feet. ;

The realizations that Pat-
terson Court has outgrown its
boundaries and that the future
of the Davidson National Print
and Drawing Competition (the
nation’s largest!) is in jeopar-
dy, both due to inadequate
facilities, are further testimony
to the unthinking inaction on the
part of some college officials.

Our only recourse as students
is to become more unified in our
efforts, more persuasive in our
argumentation, and more firm
in our convictions. We must be
persistent in obtaining in-
formation, logical in
assimilating it, and resolute in
our pressing for much needed

_ change.

As the least unified and most
vulnerable of all the constituent
groups of the college, we
students must exert even
greater efforts to ensure that
our opinions are heard and. in-
corporated in college ‘policy. If
we are not able to commit our
tirne and our energies in a large
scale way, we will not be able to
hold our own ground.

I do not want to end on too
sour a note, and I also want to
issue a public thanks to the in-
dividuals who most helped me
during the past year:

So to Brad Swalwell, Bo Hun-
ter, Steve Canterbury, Sara
Penland, John Munce, Han-
sford Epes, Rick Roylance,
Jerry Godbehere, Grover Meet-
ze, and Jack Bevan, thank you.
1974 was possible for me with
your help. 2
