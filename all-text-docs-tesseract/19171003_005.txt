{t is a splendid thing that the editor
of THE Davipsonian and his “friend”
have been so watchful over the student
hody and such close observers of its
component parts. This friend is re-
ferred to as ‘‘a close observer of college
and dormitory spirit.” and yet—I bet he
rooms on the first or second floor South
Wing Chambers! They have made the
marvelous discovery that will rival the
discovery of the arctic explorer Cook
in importance, that at Davidson there is
“the student body” and those who have
“segregated themselves” under the tin
of Rumple. It is a sure fact that neither
the editor nor his ‘‘friend” have visited
in any other dormitory for any length
of time since the opening of college. and
yet it is up to cach one of us social out-
casts to learn from such close observers
of college and dormitory life how. to
establish ourselves among the elite of the
college. But before. we of Rumple be-
gin to become “a part of the student
hodv,” “by a more general mingling
with the students of the other domi-
ciles,” we would like to know if the en-
trance requirements will be to take stor-
age in a “Squirrel’s Den” or “Bee Gum
Tree” in South Wing Chambers.

THE DAMAGE COMMITTEE,

After going thra the experience of
paying the fall term fees it is very pleas-
ant to reflect that at least two dollars
of the amount paid stands a chance of
being returned into our pockets. This
amount, unlike the regular fees, was
placed with the college bursar merely as
a deposit, to cover any damage that may
he made on college property by our-
selves during the year. After the
amount of the damage has heen deduct-
ed the remainder will be returned. on
a pro rata hasis as heretofore, to cach
student. In order that this amount may
he as large as possible it is to the in-
terest of every member of the student
hodv to see that as little damage as pos-
sible is done.

In spite of avery precaution, how-
ever, there will be some damage—per-
haps several hundred dollars’ worth—
and tho the amount may be greatly les-
sened, we can depend upon it, there will
he some damaged property that will have
to be paid for. The question then that
is most vital to our interest is, Who will
pay for the damage?

As is well known, Davidson has for a
number of years been under the Honor
System, and as a part of this system every
man is on his honor to report any dam-
age that he is witnes of to the proper
student authorities. When so reported
the damage will be charged to the man
who made it (or broke it, to be more
exact), but when not reported it will be
charged to the whole student body and
will come out of our own pockets.

Year before last 80 cents per man was
deducted for damage and the balance
returned (tho a majority of the student
hody contributed it to athletics, hecause
of a special appeal made by Coach).
Last vear the amount of damage was
less, and $1.40 was returned (tho a
laree number of students gave their’s to
the flag pole). This year most of us feel
a greater need of funds than usual and
it is probable that we will be able to re-
duce the amount of unreported damage
still more and so get a larger part of our
deposit back than ever before. There
is no reason why this cannot be done.

As announced in chapel each class has
two revrecentatives on the committee.
and reports of all damaged college prop-
ertv should be made to one of these men.
The Namave Committee for this year is
as followers:

Seninrss WG. Humphrev. 79 Cham-
bers; W. C. Cumming, 14 Rumople.

Juniors: J. T. Maddrey, 17 Cham-

Sophomores: J. F. Byrd, 5 Georgia;

gia; J. R. Boulware, Jr.. 20 Watts.

GOING BACKWARD.

“Let thine alms sweat in thy hands
til Ithou knowest to whom thou should-
est give.” says an old Christian book.
To give is indeed good, but to give just-
ly and properly is better. Any one can
succumb to the appeals of chance charr
ity; the true giver is he who devotes
his gifts to that cause which will afford
the greatest mental and spiritual return.

These somewhat philosophical _ re-
marks are brought about by a rumor, a
rumor to do away with the Davidson
College Magazine, and give that money
to the Red Cros. At first, this seems a
commendable suggestion, and patriotic.
But the more vou look at it, the more
does the praiseworthiness fade away,
and the more does the patriotism seem
misguided.

The Magazine has been here about
thirty years. Go back to some of the
old numbers, and you will not find im-
mortal literature. but vou will find
among the names of its editors and con-
tributors the names of men who .now
stand high in the world. Go and look
at some of those names, and you will

see that the Magazine has meant some-;

thing in the past; it can mean some-
thing today: it does mean something to
any man who wants to learn ta think
and to write.

Some men may not care much for the
Magazine. but shall we estimate _ its
value by their opinion? Nothing ought
to be valued in terms of those who do
not appreciate it. Do vou judge the
usefulness of a college education by the
opnions of men who do not believe in.a
college education? Do vou judge the
value of the library by the opinion of
men who never get a hook out of the
library ?

Some may say we must do something
for our country. Could ‘not we make
more money to give to our country bv
working than by coming to Davidson?
lf so. why are we at Davidson?  Be-

cause we believe, that the training that!

we receive here will ultimately make us
more useful to our country. We believe
that this training will make us more
valuable in the future than we could
nossibly he in the present. Such is the
belief that brings us to college, and it
is on such a belief that the Magazine
makes its claim for existence. Tt aims
to fit us for that future usefulness by
developing our powers of thought and
magination and by training us to use
the English language more clearly and
more forcefully.

Such is the purpose of the Magazine.
Do away with the Magazine and you
will leave the college the poorer there-
by. It is a simple question: Will you
stand behind Davidson College and
Davidson College activities, or will you

go backward ?
Wn. Love.

COLLISION TAKES PLACE
ON SOUTH MAIN STREET

On last. Wednesday night Marsh
Potts and M. M. Hampton, both resi-
dents of Davidson, ran into each other
at the corner on South Main street, near
the garage. Mr. Potts, who was driv-
ing an automobile, did not see Mr.
Hampton, who was in a hack, until he
was a few feet from him. Mr. Potts.
intending to stop at a store near the
corner, turned to the left. Mr. Hamp-
ton, not knowing this, turned to the
right. Neither party was seriously in-
jured in the collision.
