SUMMER COURSES

In order to meet the require-
ments of a larger number of stu-
dents, dates between which lab-
oratory courses will be offered
this summer, have been changed.
These courses will begin on June
10 instead of June 17 as prev-
iously announced, and will close
on July 24 instead of July 31.
This change will make it possible
for students who take an 8-hour
course the first term to take a
6-hour course the second term.
To accommodate students who
desire this plan, a
somewhat altered program has
been

to follow

arranged for the second
term.
