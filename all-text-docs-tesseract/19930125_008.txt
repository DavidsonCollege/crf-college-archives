The Bush Pardons:
Worse Than Watergate

By Alex Crumbley
Before I begin, I would like to
state my purpose in starting an
opinions column, and tell readers
that it will not always be political
like it is today, and that it will not
always be negative and inflamma-

tory as some of you may find this:

one to be. I hope it will add to this
paper a supplement to the campus-

oriented editorials conceming such
issues as the alcohol policy and the
Union Outpost, issues which are
immediately important to us but
are by no means paramount to our
growth as students or to our under-
standing of the world. Above all,
I hope I don’t look like an idiot,
and I hope that maybe some babes
will think I’m an intellectual.

My topic today concerns the
last trick George Bush pulled on us
before he left the White House and
returned to Maine, or Texas, or
whatever important electoral state
he claimed to live in. I am refer-
ring, of course, to the pardons
which he issued on Christmas Eve
while we were all out doing our

last minute Christmas shopping,
not paying any attention to our
lame duck President.
_ Forthose of you who fell prey
Bush’s downplay of the event,
Bush pardoned several members
ofReagan’s staff, including Caspar
Weinberger, for the Iran-Contra
scandal, soon after they were in-
dicted. They accepted the pardons
although they had previously
claimed innocence and got away
scot-free with the worst scandal in
recent history.

By worst, [mean worst. Worse

than bouncing a few checks, worse

than trading some inside stock-
markettips. Worse than Watergate.

The implications of Bush’s
action are many. First, pardoning
these men is little less than an
outright admission of their guilt.
The crime they committed is trea-
sonous. They sold weapons to our
blood enemies (remember thatlittle
hostage crisis? That was Iran.) and
gave the money to some guerillas

In Black & White...
On Interracial Dating

This week's perspective is from
Scott. Tune in next week for
Deidra’s side.

“If Blacks and Whites were
meant to mix, God would have
made us all the same color.”

These were the words of a
caller on a radio talk show con-
ceming interracial dating. “It’s
just not natural,” she continued.

That this kind of thought per-
sists among members of our gen-
eration is astounding. Our genera-
tion grew up, save those members
born before the 1965
Watts riots, ina period

Davidson people, if it came to a
question of personally crossing “the
color barrier,” would hesitate.
There are legitimate reasons for
hot wanting to date a person of
another race, and there are reasons
that are not legitimate. I’m afraid
that the wrong reasons dominate.

One legitimate reason is physi-
cal preference. Shortly after the
release of Jungle Fever, Spike Lee
said, during a French television
interview, that he usually didn’t
date white women because he gen-

because “it’s justnot right” or“‘you
just couldn’t” is definitely racist.
Having preferences isnot. —

.Is this why don’t we see more
interracial dating at Davidson?
Because most students prefer the
looks of members of their own
race? Partly. But there are other
reasons too. For one thing, we
hardly have enough African-
American students for anyone to
date: the population is something
like five percent. For anotherthing,
we don’t see a whole lot of interra-

cial anything here.
There are groups,

of relative racial har-
mony (barring recent
souring of race rela-
tions culminating in
the L.A. riots of this
summer). Many of our
parents were actively
involved in promoting
Civil Rights legisla-
tion in the sixties, and
all were alive during
the time of Martin
Luther King and
Malcolm X.
You’dthink some
of their intelligent
thinking would have
rubbed off on us. It

such as SERCH,

interaction among
Blacks and Whites.
BSC parties draw
mixed results as far
as White attendance.
Butthere isaremark-
able lack of Blacks
and Whites truly in-
teracting, socially
and intellectually
(how many times

that those members of
our parents’ generation who be-
lieve in some degree of racial sepa-
ration also passed along their ideas
to their children. They’re not cre-
tins, notallofthem. They justhave
a measure of hate and fear in their
hearts where acceptance should be.
There is no logical reason why
Blacks and Whites should not date
and marry. Ourcallerasserted that
it’s not natural. ‘But God didn’t
make all cats the same color, yet
nobody asserts that it’s unnatural
for a yellow cat and a grey cat to

you). Most Davidson people would
agree that, in theory, interracial
dating is just fine.

But most’

erally preferred the way black
women look. If he found a white
woman whom he considered at-
tractive, he would be willing to
date her. (Feminists, retract your
claws; we’re assuming that the
hypothetical women in question
have attractive personalities as
well. I wouldn’t assert that dating
solely involves physical attraction.)

This doesn’t make him a rac-
ist. This is the same as preferring
blondes to brunettes. Asserting
that you would never date a person
of a different race because you
don’ tlike the way any of them look

is potentially racist (because you’re.

generalizing). Asserting the same

of the biggestreasons
why there is so little
interracial dating is that people are
uncomfortable with it. There is an
unconscious societal force that says
Blacks and Whites don’t date.
Many people’s families disap-
prove, and the people who stare at
you in town and in Charlotte cer-
tainly do. People at Davidson are
remarkably accepting if a mixed-.
race couple shows up at Home-
coming. These weekend dates are
fine. But there are very few cases
where a Black person and a White
person have dated for a long time
at Davidson, and these are more or
less kept under wraps. The closest

Soccer Victory is a Symbol

By Matt Bumstead

It’s January at Davidson, and
the weather has been downright
nasty. Pretty soon we’ ll all be full
swing into the daily grind of lifeas
Davidson students (and faculty).
We’ ll moan, we’ll drag, and we’ll
probably start fussing again. Yep,
you can almost set your watch by
it.

But then again, maybe there’s
hope yet. Maybe, just maybe, when
we Start to let the work, the over-
involvement, and the fatigue get to
us, we'll stop and reflect upon
where we stood last December.

Oh sure, the weather was still
bad; and the workload was as bad
then as itever can get. But we were
smiling then. We were cheering.
Instead of working on a 14-page
paper due the next day and a 25-
page paper due the next week, I
was outin the cold with some 20 or
30 guys, painting red and white
paw prints on the streets of
Davidson. And relishing every

second of it.

For days on end, we couldn’t
study; we couldn’t even sleep at
night without first counting the
days until our Wildcat Soccer team
would again take us on the best
ride of our lives. For some of you,
this narrative may be pushing it as

"... Possibly the
greatest moment in
Davidson history-our trip
to the Final Four."

_an accurate portrayal of your state
of mind during those wonderful
four weeks. But for most of you,
I’m on the money.

For four weeks, the angry de-
bates over racism, sexism, alco-
hol, and politics cooled off and
took a back seat in casual discus-
sion, where attention was turned

instead to Rob Ukrop’s bicycle
kick, Alex Deegan’s heart-stop-
ping saves against Coastal, and
possibly the greatest sports hap-
pening in Davidson history - our
trip to the Final Four. And wasn’t
it wonderful?

For.a few weeks, we all re-
gressed to that thrilling feeling of
pride and excitement we all expe-
riencedas first-week freshmen. We
were proud. We were talking big.
We were smiling. We were LIV-
ING. We were all here together,
and we didn’t want it any other
way.

And so we reach the two-fold
point of this piece. Although a
small article in the paper can never
do the event justice, I simply
wanted to extend my own con-
gratulations to the Davidson Col-
lege Men’s Soccer Team. But,
more importantly, I want to thank
you - from me, and everyone who
