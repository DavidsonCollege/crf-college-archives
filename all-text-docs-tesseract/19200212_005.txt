Company, we don't.pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to
“go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
his strong points. As a result, our Training School mén are making good.
