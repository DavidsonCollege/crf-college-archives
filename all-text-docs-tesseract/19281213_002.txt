The Bavidsonian
Wants - -

eueryone to have a
Bery Merry Christ-
mas and a

Happy New Bear

GOING HOME

Next week some six hundred
men will turn their faces home-
ward for the Yuletide season;
many for the first time since the
opening ‘of ‘college last fall.
Freshmen will spend their first
Christmas at home as “college
men.”

It is of this latter group that
we are thinking just now. They’ve
been through a new experience
during the past few months;
they’ve formed new friendships
and new habits; they’ve met new
problems and temptations;
they’ve been punished and
pledged; they’ve had pleasant
hours and some not characterized
by pleasure; they must have
some impressions.

We're wondering, at this time,
what they think of college life;
what they think it 3+ all about;
what they think of Davidson as an
educational institution; and most
of all, what they will have to show
as having learned at Davidson.

Mister,:are you glad you came
to Davidson? Are you fitting in
with Davidson ideals and tradi-
tions? Are you fulfilling the pur-
pose for which you were sent
here? If so, we’re mighty glad.
If not, we’re sorry. .Why. aren’t
you? ‘Whose faul is it? Think
about these things, won’t you?

Of course, almost everybody
will say that Davidson is the
finest place on earth and will
come to blows almost to make
that fellow believe that the Wild-
cats really won that game—but—
And we hope you will have that
feeling and be eagerly demon-
stative of Davidson’s splendid
spirit but we hope that you will
show how the spirit works a lit-
tle more than you tell about it.

NOT SO LOUD

If the approaching days until
the Christmas holidays are as
those of past years there willbe
that tendency to make all the
noise possible in the dormitories.
It should not be thought that se-
rious-minded and considerate men
are responsible for the disturb-
ance prevalent at this time for
they are not. Only those few fel-
lows who are more filled with
their own ideas of a good time
than with their responsibilities
and duties and who are more

thoughtful of themselves than of
their next-door neighbor engage
in such enterprises. There’s lots

of work for everybody, men. The
term is drawing to a close and in-
tensive work is imperative. Think
about the other fellow!

DAUBING CHAM’S COLORS

It seems that everybody wants
to express criticism about some-
thing and that something at Da-
vidson is Cham.

Literary. magazines on nearly
every campus have a difficult
course ; they meet with something
of ill-favor; the students offer
more criticism than selections to
fill the pages. It’s really a prob-
lenr~for~ unfortunate editor.
We're sympathetic——_

The Chameleon makes no pre-
tense at rivalling the literary
works of the great Northern uni-
versities; you shouldn’t compare
it with current periodicals of the
same general type. You might as
well compare The Davidsonian
with the New York Times. We
say you might. .

Then there’s he cruel ‘reviewer.
Ever_ since we can remember
somebody has enjoyed’ “cussing
out” the magazine here. Maybe
it merits it at times; maybe it
doesn’t at others. The thing
about it is that we hate to see a
habit formed to the degree that
the readers of this journal will
know how the reviewer will greet
The Chameleon. It looks like
Cham ought to get a break now
and then. a

Concerning the recent issue.
We think it very good. And don’t
think we mean it is literary when
we pay such a compliment. It is
a very good student attempt.
There’s. practically no response—
well, you’d be surprised at the
number of contributions submit-
ted. Literary magazines and lit-
erary societies don’t mean so
much as they once did and that
fact should be faced,

If the student body is dissatis-
fied with the contents of the mag-
azine—and many are, if we can
believe what they say—then sub-
mit some of your own work—or
keep quiet.

COLUMNS OF CHAMBERS—
A MONUMENT TO WHAT?

There has been much specula-

tion since the destruction of the
old Chambers Building as to what
disposition would be made of the
four giant columns left standing
when the rest of the debris from
the fire was removed.
Suggestions relative to he con-
version of the pillars into a so-
called attractive something or
other—we don’t ¢know just what
—to.commemorate the fact that
Old Chambers Building once
stood on that spot have been
made, But the ones responsible
for any such suggestion certainly
must not have been serious or
have forgotten that there is a new
building on the same location re-
placing the former one.
Is it that their aesthetic nature
would leave the old, dingy, broken
stone-heaps in the very center-
front of the beautiful new struc-
ture? It must be a new type of
beauty.

Surely, when the time comes
for clearing away all the material
used in constructing the building
and when the grounds are ready
for landscaping workers, these
will be gone. Nothing should mar
the beauty and the grandeur of
the new, greater, and more fitting
monument to the finest ideals and
traditions of “Old Davidson.”

A thing of beauty is a great ex-
pense—especially. at Christmas.

There is little chance to outlaw
war; we may eventually outgrow

Cosmic Chaos
By J. W. McCutchan

Wars and rumors of wars float from
the Balkan states, the cradles of many
wars. Lloyd George appears to be
pertubed and Lord Chamberlain, angry.
And there are other struggles also be-
ing planned, to wit: Examinations on
the Hill, and the Prince of Wales’ mar-
riage to Lady Ann Wellesly. One can
easily liken the Balkans to reviews, in-
dicative of something worse to follow.
Mussolini also breaks into the argu-
ment, comparable to any local “shoot-
er” of students.

Hypnotic students. exhibit evident
interest over the coming performance
of Fayssoux, entertainer and psychol-
ogist-extraordinary. (This is not an
advertisement). Always a debated
subject, hypnotism and mesmerism
claim more serious attention than for-
merly. As to whether the subject goes
bathing on the stage from fright of
the professor’s “evil eye,” from a pe-
culiar wish to comply and act at the
same time, or through hypnotic and
subsconcious suggestion, this column
declines to be an authority. However
it is to be noted that the courts of
one state have recognized this phase
of, abnormal pSychology to be an in-
ducement to crime, in many cases.

Pitiful to behold were the efforts of
the Color detail to locate the colors,
belonging to the local unit of R. O. T.
C. It sems that some upknown party
has literally “torn that tattered en-
sign down,” to the evident embarrass-
ment of those sophomores whose duty
it is to raise and lower it daily. It is
believed that the Student Body favors
another flag, but the fitness of receiv-
ing it as a gift from the Senior Class
is questioned.

Falling in line with other cinema ad-
vocates, suffering from common lack
of amusement, many witnessed “Dream
of Love” presented at the local Or-
pheum. Doubtless many, wondered
when thinking over various scenes, as
to whether the production might be
termed realistic or idealistic, It is
commonly agreed, however, that the
leading lady was very, very real, and
the contact ‘ideal.

After having been somewhat incon-
venienced on a date not far gone, this
writer cannot refrain fifém again be-
wailing lack of transportation from
the Queen City. We were unable to
locate the “young man with the fast
car, leaving at 10, 12, and 2.” It is al-
so wondered as to what relief has
been offered by the change of schedule
announced by the Camel City Bus
Lines.

WANTON WILES

By Dave Anderson

The bill for Federaleprohibition en-
forcement for the next fiscal year calls
for $40,000,000 (and the Canadian au-
thorities hope htat some of the money
will be used to keep American synthet-
ic gin from crossing the border). Dr.
Doran, prohibition commissioner, es-
timates that it would cost $300,000,000
to make anything like an effectual ef-
fort at enforcement. He complains of
lack of state co-operation, but admits
that the state police have never re-
fused to aid when requested.

Congress would refuse to grant such
a stupendous sun. Nether treasury
or public opinion would stand it. In-
stead of confessing the obvious failure,
Congress is willing to continue voting
this annual dole of $40,000000. That
may be regarded as a sop to the Drys.
Are America so fond of humbug
that they are willing to pay for it in-
definitely ?

What does it profit a! party to be in
control and have a short session of
Congress inflicted upon it?

Sigrid Undset,

Norweigan woman
author, who was awarded the 1928

Nobel prize for literature, is a strange
character. No visitor is ever received
in the little country house that she in-
habits on the other end of Norway.
She never opens a single letter and
still she receives several hundred per
day. She has not yet thanked the Royal
Swedish academy for the million
crowns that fall to her lot in recog-
nition of her talent. It is the first time
in history that this august body is the
object of what might be called ingrat-
itude. But neither has. she replied to
the personal messages of congratula-

tion from threé Scandinavian mon-
archs. She is giving her money to
charity.

After every rain Georgia has chain

Dean Wodbridge of Columbia, in his
annual report, put in a new way the
problem which graduate schools are
facing with increasing perplexity.
“They have become predominately
schools for college graduates rather
than schools for graduate instruction
and research—congenial academic re-
sorts frequented by many without
thought of the advancement of learn-
ing or, at any rate, without ambition
to enlarge the areas of human knowl-
edge.” He suggests that we segregate
the students who do scholarly re-
search, the “sheep,” from those who
study for their own pleasure or for the
teaching of others, the “goats.” But
in Mediterranean lands shepherds often
take goats to lead their flocks of sheep
to pasturage.

THE BULL PEN

New Year's Greetings and a glorious twenty-fifth of December to all,
foolish readers, Perhaps this a bit previous, or, maybe exceedingly stale—
depending on whether this Davidsonian gets out before Christmas or not.
Anyhow, we have the Christmas spirit,
So a. merry Christmas to all, and best wishes for a quick recovery.

A bit of advice, which you have perhaps never heard before: Do your
Christmas shopping early. Better still, don’t do any at all and give what you

in spite of, or, because of prohibition.

All donations gratefully received, and

they won’t go where your contributions go. Address, care of Feature Editor,
The: Davidsonian, Davidson, N. C. Oh, we won't be selfish, We promise to

put aside a nickel toward the “new”

swimming pool, and, incidentally, we will buy a penny box of matches with a
portion, and do hereby solemnly swear to dole them out to these pauper
Freshmen who never seem to have money to buy matches.

Dear Sir:
I am the foreman of a ditch-digging
crew, and just happened to read the
copies of the college magazine that
one of the boys brought in this after-

Can you tell me where I can get in

A FLAG, A FLAG!
Dear Ed(itor) :

And now'there is no flag at all. Ben-

with him when the adage is applied to
a flag. A half-flag is worse than none,

the flag up—or did it just blow away?

Champaign, Ill, Dec. 6—An “Illinois
code of sportsmanship,” decrying boo-
ing and hissing at athletic contests,
especially at basketball gatnes, was
adopted by 400 University of Illinois
students here in a mass meeting which
came as a climax to a week’s cam-
paigning for better sportsmanship.

The code, which follows, represent-
ed the composite of several hundred
submitted by students during the cam-

paign: :

A true Illini sportsman:

1. Will consider all athletic oppo-
nents as guésts and treat them with all
of the courtesies due friends and
guests.

2., Will accept all decisions without
question. ;

3. Will never hiss or boo a player
or| official.

4. Will never utter abusive or ir-
ritating remarks from the sideline.

5. Will applaud opponents who
makes good plays or show god sports-
manship.

6. Will never attempt to rattle an
opposite player, such as the pitcher in

ball game.

7. Will seek to win by fair and law-
ful means, according to the rules of
the game.

8. Will love the game for its own
sake and not for what winning may
bring him.

9. Will “do unto others as he would
have them do unto him.”

10. Will “win without boasting and
lose without excuse.”

Approval of the campaign and its
aim to reform conditions believed
menacing tothe existence of basketball
as a Western Conference sport was
voiced by John Griffith, commisioner
of the Big Ten, Director George Huff
of Illinois and Russ Crane, captain-
elect in football?

THIS IS WHY
Mr. Editor:

In last week’s edifion of The David-
sonian there was a suggestion that the
gift of the Seniors be a picture or a
fund with which to begin an art gal-
lery in order to give an opportunity
to those who are seeking for a glimpse
into the realms of the fine arts.

But as the writer of this article says
it has been the ustom for this gift, if
not principally useful to be noticeable.
Would an art gallery at Davidson if
noticeable be noticed by the students in
the way intended? - In the library

pictures on the walls in the various
rooms, but how many students could
describe or tell the names of more
than two of them? There has been
for a a few days each year for the last,
few years an art exhibit of some kind
at the College. But how many knew
when it was here, or took the trouble
to examine the pictures? There is
given this year for the first time a
course in art at the College. Five stu-
dents are interested enought to take
it, and when others ask about it with
the idea of taking it next year the
question is not, is the course well worth
taking, but is it a “crip.” The stu-
dents of Davidson are fiot interested
in art.

The expense ofa really good piture
would be more than the majority of
the class would want to bear and sure-
ly, the class would not be content with
one of the mediocre type. A fund
might be given but it would merely
lie idle until other classes were inspired
with the Zeal to add to it.

Ifa picture were given where could
it be’ placed? The only reasonable
suggestions are the Library and the
New Chambers Building. The library
has no place for it and has the Cham-
bers Building been built with plans
for a future gallery?

It seems that the writer in his love
for art and desire to see it advaned
has forgotten to be practical.
