A DAVIDSON SONG.
Charlotte, N. C., Oct. 20, 1916.

A good, rousing march song will do
much to increase and focus the loyalty
of Davidson students and alumni, and
will be a great aid to organized demon-
strations at games.

However, Davidson already has an
“Alma Mater” type of song which is
strictly her own. And when the college
waited nearly cighty years before anyone
had the interest—for there must have
been talent before—to produce a song.
T think the writer deserves some credit.

Davidson has never had a more loyal
student nor alumnus than McIlwaine,
and IT think his work deserves recogni-
tion. Tt will stand on its own merit.

OF course. however, “Davidson For
Aye” won't fill the present need; and I
sincerely hope some good songs will be
received. The words are most import-
ant, but I should like to see an original
air as well.

Then the two songs should go side by

side, the one the “Alma Mater”
the other the “Battle Hymn.”

I find that 1 have an extra copy of
“Davidson for Aye.” which Pam en-
closing.

With best wishes, | am,

Most sincerely,
Exocu Faw.

song,

The words to the song referred to,
“Davidson For Aye.” are as follows:

Davidson, thy name so glorious
Ever shines it bright before us;
Over all thy foes victorious
> Waves thy banner high.
Davidson we're singing
Davidson ‘tis ringing
In the hearts of all thy children
To thy precepts clinging.
Thou our glorious Alma: Mater
Lead us on to fight and conquer,
And our hearts’ complete surrender
Ker will be to thee.

Davidson, again we sing thee:
Full devotion now we bring thee ;
‘Vhou the queen of all that name thee
Hail! forever hail!
Davidson we're singing
Davidson ‘tis ringing
In che hearts of all thy children
‘Yo thy precepts clinging.
All thy love shall be requited
As thy sons we. stand united.
Hail to thee our Alma Mater!
Davidson for aye!

A STATEMENT.

“The Davidsonian,

N.C.

lditor
Davidson,

Dear Sir: 1 note your statement. in
regard to the 916) “Quips and
Cranks.” especially where reference is
made to the engravings. E feel impelled
to say in fairness to Mr. Foote. of the
Foote & Davies Co., who published the
Annuals, that the fault was not in. the
engravings. but in the photography.
Foote & Davies lost in’ the neighbor-
hoad of two thousand dollars: on this
issue of “Quips and Cranks." largely
because the photographs were inferior
in quality and were late in being deliv-
“red by the photographer.

The publishers very manfully should-
ered the loss in order to give us the best
Annual possible, and | would consider
it an act of fairness and justice on our
part to give the same prominence to this
statement that was accorded to the first
one with reference to the Annual.

Very truly yours,
Li.Rovy A. Mutren, '16.,
Editor-in-Chief.

waa MAKES A GOOD
PLAYER?!

FOOTBALL

If any one should ask you, What it
takes to make a good or successful foot-
ball player, no doubt you would answer
at once, Nerve or courage. You would
be partly right. But nerve isn’t the main
asset of the game. Love of the game is
the real secret of football.

I've seen men avho had fine husks
bodies, with as much nerve as anybody.
and who knew the theory of playing the
game, vet were not good players. “They
only tried to plav a short while; then
gave it up. They did not love the game.
That's the thing that makes a fellow,
after being tackled so hard that he sees
stars, and being so fatigued that he can
hardly walk, vet as soon as the pain eases
a little is re: ady to start back at the op-
posite team and fight every inch of the
way. No one who shrinks at the hard
knocks he gets, and: is thinking about
how to save himself from getting hurt.
ever makes a good football plaver. He
must love the game.

It isn't the so-called yellow streak that
causes them to give it up. For you will
find on 2 broad average that one man
is about as brave as another, or would
be under the same conditions. Courage
in football is often’ spoken of as ai rare
quality, whereas it is ane of the most
prevalent qualities in the game, “There
are few in the game who are without it.
Efficiency in the game is not only a raret
auality than courage, but it is also toa
large extent the producer of courage
There are times, tho, when courage
overplayed. “The best instructors in th
game start in to make their men com
petent, knowing that mose of the time
competency will develop courage.

“bull dog phick.”” Yale Jast: fall) went
against Harvard ready to die if necessary
to redeem the bluc. Yale undoubtedly
started with all the grim courage she
could carry, but of what use was this
“bull-dog pluck” against: efficiency and
a competenct that overwhelmed ?

This isn't intended as any poke at cour
age, gameness or grit. “The poiat is that
courage as a winning characteristic can
be overplaved; that it will not get vou

this the coaches should be supremely
thankful. ;

It was Davidson that came to Adanta
last season about this same time - and
woke the Jackets to a realization that
they could not rest on their Jaurels or
supposed strength, but must get out and
fight for all there was in them.

This vear Davidson repeated the dose,
though she carried it dangerously near a
defeat for the Jackets and it was plainly
a worried bunch of ‘Lech supporters that
followed the fortunes of their eleven the
first two quarters of the game.

Which brings us to the. point at issue
There will be some hustling at the Flats
this week to endeavor to whip the cleven
in shape for the next game which will
be with the North Carolina ‘T'ar-Heels.

Coach Heisman witnessed the Rut-
gers-Washington & Lee game Saturday
to get first-hand information as to what
the Generals possess. As some way ia
the crowd most aptly put it, “Some one
ought to have gotten a little more dope
on this Davidson team.” When “Heis”
