THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE STUDENT BOOY

FRIDAY, MARCH 18, 1966

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

A Positive Approach

We are confident that the faculty
and Trustees of the college will give
little serious attention to the rather
benign attempts of a few stubborn stu-
dents to stage a boycott of Sunday
night's vesper service.

it is disheartening to student lead-
ers for several of their peers to be
so suddenly indiscreet and intractable
as to ruin a serious approach to the
dilemma of required religious services
at Davidson. ;

We have no quarrel with the un-
derlying reason for the idea of a boy
cott—a growing rebellion against re.
quired vespers.

But unfortunately the stubborn ele
ment wants to have the cake and eat
it, too. ;

During the past years required re-
ligious services have provided stu-
dents with spiritually stimulating
speakers and programs. .But the Sun-
day night vespers service has outlived
its usefulness now.

The steady relaxation of rules gov-
erning attendance is positive evidence
of the college’s realization that these
required exercises are losing their
purpose and place at Davidson.

Loosening of the attendance re-
quirements has been recommended
through the years in a major part by

“ students. ;

There is no reason to believe that
the. current proposals by students
which are being considered by the
faculty’s Religious Life Committee—

including one recommendation that
vespers be abolished entirely — will
not be discussed fully by the com-
mittee, which includes three student
representatives.

During the past two years, two
major changes have been recommend-
ed and approved by this committee.
In 1964 the committee recommended
that students be allowed to substi-
tute morning worship services in the
town of Davidson for the Sunday night
services. Beginning this year, Jewish,
Catholic and Greek Orthodox stu-
dents were allowed to substitute atten-
dance at services outside the town of
Davidson.

We would like to see Davidson's
Christian purpose upheld even more
strongly.

This cannot be achieved through
the force and threat of a boycott but
rather through a positive and really
meaningful program which is pro-
viding more than the degenerate ves-
pers services.

This, we believe, must be foremost
in the minds of those who are truly
concerned with supporting the Chris-
tian commitment of the college.

A part of the recently adopted
Statement of Purpose of the college
should be directed to all sides in the
current discussion: “Faith and reason
must work together in mutual respect
if Davidson is to realize her vision of
excellence. .. .”

Meanwhile, Back At The Ranch

While the attention of many old
and new fans of Davidson was focused
on the prowess of the Wildcat basket-
ball team last week, academic excel-
lence rocked right along on campus.

Numerous students and professors
credited themselves and their school
in a much more meaningful and last-
ing manner, which is not to say that
the accomplishments and rewards of
Coach Lefty Driesell’s team are the
slightest undeserved.

Not many college players, however,
can note with pride the achievements
of their classmates “back home”.

Last week a record number of Dav-
idson students—11 seniors and two
juniors—was elected to membership
in Phi Beta Kappa, the nation’s fore-
most scholastic fraternity and the
highest academic honor which can
come to an-undergraduate at David-
son.

The total of 20 students which have
been named to the society this year
represents the largest number of un-
dergraduates to be initiated by the
Davidson chapter in its 43-year his-
tory.

Two Davidson seniors were named
last week-as recipients of Danforth
Scholarships. Four students, includ-
ing the two winners of the Danforth
awards, received Woodrow Wilson
Fellowships, which are also awarded
to potential college teachers.

At the same time, another senior
was awarded one of the 60 Rocke-
feller Brothers graduate fellowships
in the nation this year:

Before the awards were announced,
Davidson stood ninth in the number
of Danforth winners, and fifth in the
number of Rockefeller Brothers Fel-

lowship winners.

The college, of course, has received
more Woodrow Wilson grants than
any other college in the Southeast.

Also sandwiched between the
Blacksburg success story and the Ra-
leigh farce last week was the an-
nouncement of a chapter of Omicron
Delta Epsilon, and of the 14 charter
members to the honorary business fra-
ternity. The 14 seniors have achieved
a 2.0 overall grade average in addi-
tion to a 2.25 grade average in their
major field of economics.

Bowing ironically to the unexpected
success of the campus brawn last
week was the cast of The Glass Men-
agerie, which postponed the scheduled
weekend performances in deference
to the Wildcats’ participation in the
NCAA Playoffs.

The play is without a doubt one
of the finest productions to come out
of the Department of Drama—not-
withstanding the hasty obeisance to
the basketballers.

As THE DAVIDSONIAN’s review
stated last week, “It had (careful) han-
dling, from an exceptionally fine cast,
a good production staff, and. at the
heart of it all, the director, Mr. Bar-

er.”

We are indeed proud that David-
son’s fortunes and the achievements
of her students are not grounded sole.
ly in one field or another; rather, the
liberal arts program here has had
multifarious success.

The events of last week—both the
seemingly ordinary and the totally un-
precedented—bear out the college’s
stated aim to emphasize “those
studies, disciplines and activities
which liberate men physically, men-
tally and spiritually.”

Accomodating The Interests

We are encouraged to hear of the
consideration being given by the Aca-
demic Scheduling Committee of the
faculty to the possibility of scheduling
first semester examinations before
Christmas.

The matter of accommodating the
various interests of the college in the
academic calendar is no easy propo-
sition.

Furthermore, the problem at David-
son has increased tremendously within
the past two years. due to the neces-
sity of scheduling “major” basketball
opponents several years in advance.

Already committments have been
made on the basketball schedule for
the 1968-69 season, according to Ath-
letic Director Tom Scott. .

For this reason the Academic
Scheduling Committee is playing a
foolish game by failing to decide im-
mediately on the possibility of such
a changeover in the schedule.

There are numerous advantages to
moving the calendar back by only
three weeks from its present set-up.
The most obvious would be the com-
pletion of the first semester’s work
before the distracting two weeks of
Christmas vacation, thereby eliminat-
ing the terrible two-week cramming
period between Christmas and exam-
inations. Also an expanded Christmas
vacation would be possible.

Many schools have adopted such a
system recently, most for the first
time this year. Most state-sup orted
schools in South Carolina, including
Clemson and Winthrop, went under
the system this year. Presbyterian Col-
lege, Pfeiffer and other smaller col-
leges have received the new program
favorably.

The only real disadvantage to such
an arrangement would have the first
semester classes beginning during the
last week in August.

In recent opinion polls, 74 per cent
of the faculty favored a change which
would schedule first-semester exam-
inations before Christmas, while 60
per cent of the student body favored
such a change.

We hope that the faculty committee
will wait no longer to recommend the
adoption of this more efficient cal-
endar; for, every day’s delay in de-
ciding on this question merely com-
plicates the matter of accommodating
the academic and athletic schedules.

Students, professors and adminis-
trators alike stand to gain from the
prmoptness of this committee.

Essential Roles

Each year about this time a group
of 16 seniors pitches in to help on an
annual project which for them is rec-
ognition of a valuable characteristic—
their dependability.

The Elections Board, which is ap-
pointed by the Student Council and
includes a member of each fraternity
and four Independents, demands some
time-consuming and often frustrating
work on the part of its members.

This year’s job has been complicat- .

ed by an unusual number of close
votes, which, of course, necessitates
careful counting of the ballots and
late posting of the election returns.
We don't envy the jobs of these
seniors, but we do wish to recognize
Ahe essential roles they are playing
in the routine of student government.

Dear Editor:

Attacking Sing Out 66 may be
similar to attacking Batman, bul
here ‘tis.

The question we must ask our-
selves as well as the Sing Out ‘66

group is ‘Sing Out For What?""’

A group that generates enthusi-
asm as does this group certainly
must know what they are singing
out for. They obviously have the
emotional appeal, but what do

they offer for man in the form
of a positive way of life for our
generation? |

They offer a set of four ‘‘abso-
lute standards’ (love, honesty,
unselfishness, and purity) which
if followed for one week will
make man more human! How
are these standards made con-
crete and real? They are accept-
ed on faith and come to man in
“the form of an inner voice from

the Supreme Being!"

The points I make are as fol-
lows:

1) is there any absolute stand-
ard that is best in all situations?

2) how does one know his ‘‘in
ner voice” will be the right an-
swer for a situation assuming
there is the right answer?

3) there is even disagreement
within the group itself as to
working definitions of the four

From Different Viewpoint

Dear Editor:

Last semester I wrote an ill-
conceived, ill-expressed letter to
the editor calling compulsory
worship regulations ‘‘indefen-
sible’ and demanding for us stu-
dents ‘Freedom Now.”

The fact is that the present
policy is. indeed, “defensible.
What wonder hath God wrought
- a student in favor of compul-
sory worship? On the contrary,
Lremain opposed, but hours of
discussion with members of the
faculty and administration have
conviriced me that in this issue
black-and-white thinking is ut-
terly naive. whether pro or con.

More times than can be count-
ed alumni. many of whom were
outspoken critics of compulsory
worship as students, have writ-
ten back and implored members
of the faculty and administration
to continue requiring worship.
Apparently after graduation
from Davidson. these men found
a new appreciation for the bene-
fit they had received from com-
pulsory worship. This fact urges
us to clarifv the issue by asking.
not “Which arrangement is the
most enjoyable?" but “Which
arrangement is ultimately best
for the men involved?”

It so happens that the value-
commitment of the majority of
the faculty thus far has led them
to feel that the ultimate bene-
fits Davidson men receive from
compulsory worship, are great
enough to call for continuation
of compulsory worship despite:
loud student protests. ;

With the full awareness that I
may be entirely wrong. I would
like to level a renewed criticism
of compulsory worship regula-
tions.

Granted, it is commendable to
ask, ‘What is ultimately good
for Davidson men?” But another
question lies beyond it. perhaps
an even more significant ques-
tion, namelv, ‘Shall we reepect
a man’s right to choose his own
ultimate good?” It would seem.
in light ‘of compulsory worsh'
regulations, that the fact'tv.and
administration would answer ‘ho
latter question. “No.”

No critic can deny their righ’.
to impose their value-comm'
ments upon us. And if we d's
like the imposition. we are f-rr
to leave Davidson. All wr car dn
is urge the facultv and adminis
tration. to respect our rot of
self-determination. especially re-
ligious self determination.

They are understandably in
clined to wonder if we are
“men” at all. so immature are
most of our protests and so often
do alumni write, “You were
right after all.’ But it seems
that one’s college years should
be the most significantly forma-
tive years of one's education. It
seems further that in these years
we must develop and cultivate a
value-system that is genuinely
our own, a value-system chosen
in the face of live and well-
presented alternatives. And it
seems also that in these years
we must develop a true sense of
responsibility for our own wel-
fare and our own actions, and
responsibility necessitates free-

dom.

If we as students should be ex-
pected to admit our own impul-
sive immaturity (which is also
a growing-toward-maturity), the
faculty should at Jeast be ex-
pected to admit that. it has been
inconsistent by, on the one hand.
encouraging us to be responsible
‘in the areas of study and con
duct. and on the other hand de-
nying us the right to determine
our own religious activities. As
I mentioned in my former let-
ter,, perhaps it would be more
Christian for the faculty to al-
low us religious freedom while
taking away our freedom of
study and conduct, than to con-
tinue the present inconsistent
policy.

It seems unlikely that those
alumni who disagree with pres-
ent policies of compulsory wor-
ship would feel inclined to write
back, still complaining like stu-
dents. In no sense can it be cer-
tainly maintained that opinions
expressed fn letters of alumni
constitute a representative sam-
ple of alumni views. Only the
alumni who care (enough to
write) are going to write at all.

Indeed, it may possibly be that
most of those alumni who favor
compulsory worship are still re-
ligiously immature because they
were denied religious self-deter-
mination during their crucial
college years. (Surely, for the
Christian, religious maturity in-
volves a profound respect for the
individual and his right to self-
determination and to value-com-
mitment.)

Th. seems. apparent to me that
the present college policy evi-
dences literally a neurgtic inse-
curity, perhaps from an‘ underly-
ing fear to let students face on
equal footing views which rival
or oppose Christianity. Only as
a man struggles with live alter-
natives, will his choice be a valid
one. and only then can he have
any sound basis to expect that
h's faith will enable him, not to
avo'd. but to deal adaptively and
constructively with the realities
and problems of life.

Theee are by no means orig:
inal :‘deas, To me they seem pat-
ently obvious and integral to a
constructive theory of education.
Thus I hope this time I do not of-
fend anvone when, in the (Chris
t'an) interests of spiritual ma-
turity and of respect for individ-
ual dignity and self-determina-
tion. I renew my request to the
faculty and administration that
present policies of compulsory
worship be seriously questioned.

Dear Editor:

The Tuesday coffee hour which
took place after Senator Thur-
mond’s chapel speech has
prompted us to make certain
comments concerning the ques-
tioning which took place. We
wish to make it clear that we
are not concerned here with de-
fending or attacking Senator
Thurmond’s political position.

Although we agree that ques-
tions which serve to clarify is-

“absolute standards”—i.e., pur-
ity does not mean the same to
all!

4) has the fast moving Sing

Out ‘66 ever slowed down long all

enough to reflect upon its own
values and realize that they are
accepting and assuming a cer-
tain set of values and thereby
rejecting other sets of values!

5) does the group realize it is

a pressure group trying to effect
certain values or does it think
it Is the “inner voice from the
Supreme Being’!

6) does Sing Out ‘66 think at

!

7) Does Sing Out ‘66 in essence
do anything positive with the
emotional enthusiasm they cause
to be generated? ’

Davidson College

sues and point out fallacies— .
even questions to state opposing |

arguments—are proper during a
coffee hour discussion: we are
opposed to questioning which
serves only to ridicule the speak
er.
It seems that such ‘inquiries’
are made solely for the purpose
of enhancing one’s own image
within his particular ‘‘intellec-
tual group.”

Moreover, it seems that many
individuals are overly concerned
with demonstrating their ability
to phrase complicated disserta-
tions of an abstract nature,
which serve no constructive pur-
pose and hardly lend themselves
to a short and informal coffee
hour discussion.

We do not believe that ‘‘intel-
lectualism’’ should be taken as
license to treat any guest speak-
er of the College disrespectfully,
no matter to what extent we may
feel his ideas are inferior to our
own.

Dear Editor:

As a resident of ‘(Cardboard
Village” I feel I must make
some response to the very bias-
ed article on Jackson Heights
which appeared in the February
25th issue of THE DAVIDSON-
TAN.

The article stressed repeated-
ly (and exaggerated greatly) the
shortcomings of these cottages,
but somehow failed to mention
their advantages. For example.
no mention was made of the fact
that the college maintenance de-
partment provides immediate
service on any request we make.

The trains. which you dwelled
on at length, are not even no-
ticed after a few days of resi-
dency. I have lived here two
years, and have yet to see a ter-
mite. My heating bill. despite
the lack of insulation. is surpris-
ingly low. Your threatened drafts
of 40 degree air do not exist.

You stated that, “‘the one real
advantage of living in ‘Card-
board Village’ is that it is off
campus as far as college regula-
tions are concerned."’ Well, you
are wrong again, as the principal
advantage is the low rent... to
be exact. $35 monthly.

Somehow even this fact, was
omitted from the article. Hous-
ing of similar size in Chapel Hill
rents for over $80 per month,
and the tenants are subject to a
myriad of college regulations.

You will do well to remember
that none of us lives in “village
huts” because we are required
to do so. Rather, we are grate-
ful for such economical and con-
venient housing I personally am
sickened, however, by the wide-
spread spirit of ungratefulness
prevalent at Davidson, which
shows itself even in an article
about married student housing.

Davidsonian Associate Edisor

H. Ellison Pusser

This election week, platforms have been ub-
iquitous. Their suggestions have been by and large
worthwhile. However, most of these ideas will remain

as such unless a nucleus

of students interested in

one particular reform tackles it and makes sure views
are presented to the faculty, administration, and

trustees.

In this, a secofd semester senior’s final column,
I shall enumerate the changes I would like to see
made here by the time of the Class of 1966’s second

or third reunion.

ACADEMICS AND ADMINISTRATION
_ An end to Saturday classes is favored by both a
majority of Faculty and students, yet the Scheduling
Committee is going to over-rule the roposal due to
the difficulty in scheduling labs. I think a way can
be found to go on a five-day week. :
First semester examinations before Christmas,
with Commencement in mid-May, is feasible, and

worth a try.

The honors program requirement in all majors
should be lowered to a 2 overall average, and pro-
vision should be ‘made to allow those with 1.75 or
better averages enter the program with the Depart-

ment’s consent.

Compulsory Army ROTC for freshmen and soph-
omores should be discontinued and other ROTC pro-
rams made available to Davidson students. All
reshmen should be made aware of the advantages
of the various services’ ROTC programs, and then

be allowed to choose.

The thrice weekly assembly periods are far too
numerous. Required assembly should be called only
when a speaker of note is to be present. A combined
system of cuts for these programs and any cultural
event on campus should be instituted.

I feel more aggressiveness in finding new pro-
fessors is needed. If the College’s stated aim for its
faculty is to have a body of teachers, then hire good
teachers. Many brilliant men are complete losses at

the lectern.

Spanish should find its place as a major lan-
guage here. More freshmen should be encouraged to
take it; a Junior Year Abroad program should be
organized for Spain or Mexico.

Student jobs should pay the federal wage min-

imum.

_ Some provision for the student with three re-
views in a day should be made.

_ The second semester senior year should be ex-
amined, and a possible institution of a six or nine
hour senior thesis be considered, with few other
course requirements placed on the senior.

I feel the Admissions Office could better use our
students as recruiters for new students, and as liai-
son men between the school and its applicants. Ad-
ditional applications should never be discouraged;
the College can afford to hire additional Admissions

officers if need be.

Davidson has got to decide soon just what role
she wants athletics to play in her future. Should she
try to emphasize both football and basketball? Should
she emphasize only basketball? Should she emphasize
any sports? Is she aware of the dangers of ‘big-time’
athletics? Do athletic victories that please alumni or
academic victories that please foundations appear
more desirous to the College?

STUDENT LIFE

Some teeth should be put into. the student body
regulation against dorm noise. There is no reason
for a few people on each hall to disturb regularly the

work and sleep of others.

Some sort of “collective

security” could be organized on each hall, as action.

by an individual is se

dom effective (and this person

is termed a ‘bad guy’ by his hall’s Hell raisers.)
The editor of THE DAVIDSONIAN should be
compensated in some way for the tremendous amount
of time he puts in. Few schools fail to grant a tui-
tion reduction, or course credit, or a regular salary,

to their newspaper editor.
PHYSICAL PLANT

Improve the campus lighting system. This can
be done by using lighting fixtures that would con-
form better to the campus than the garish ones of
last year’s attempt. A survey of outdoor lighting
needs might be made. One bad spot is the step on
the walk between the Union and East.

_ Better maintenance of the dormitories should be
strived for, and at the same time students should be
held strictly responsible for damage to their dorms.

In the not too distant future, a new library, to
be hopefully the center of campus activity (as op-
posed to the Union, or the Gym), will be built. Parts
of it should be open 24 hours a day; it should be air
conditioned, sound proofed, and have adequate car-
rel space. The best ideas from libraries across the
country should be combined to make this the most

frequented building here.

_And, hopefully, planning will start on the ‘co-
ordinate college’ concept, so that one day soon, ‘Just
up the road’ won’t only refer to Hattie’s, but also to

Davidson's girls’ college.
AN APOLOGY ~

My last week’s blast at the ROTC Department
for alleged misconduct of its flag duties was largely
without grounds. I have. been informed that the
American flag that flies at the north end of Cham-
bers is an all-weather flag, and is thus impervious to
the vicissitudes of Mother Nature. It can fly at any
time of day, in any weather.

My views as to flag respect were unfortunately
formed during my Boy Scout days, when I learned,
on page 69 of the Boy Scout Handbook, that, “The
flag of the United States should be flown every day
when the weather permits . . .” ;

I guess synthetic flags have not yet made the

Scouting scene.
