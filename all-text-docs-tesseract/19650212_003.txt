THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE THREE

By DOUG WOODWORTH

Davidson Junior Abroad

A great misconception ex-
ists on the two sides of the
ocean, and probably the
Frenchmen are more guilty
than the Americans. The
Frenchman's vision of the
American student’s carefree
life goes so far as to think
that every student has an
automobile, several hours
every day of some sort of
sports activity, and very lit-
tle work or pressure from
his actual studies.

WOODWORTH

He bemoans the fact that he
does not have the facilities for
sports available to him, but
even more that if the facilities
were available he would not
have time to continue with his
studies and be ‘“‘sportif’’ at the
same time; and such a fact is
probably true, but I am con-
vinced that this is a result not
of the amount of work that the
student has, but of the difficul-
ties presented in the organiza-

tion of the French university and
the student’s life.

It remains to be seen just
how drastically the student life
is going to change toward the
end of April and the month
of May when the threat of ex-
amination presents itself; but
from the first of November un
tel that time there is literally
no one who suffers from mental
exhaustion, nervous breakdowns,
or a terrible loss of sleep.

the year if he wants to, though
little cutting on the
part of most French students,
at least in Montpellier where
the. classrooms are crowded but
not as crowded as in some other
universities. What is it then that
occupies so much time for the
French student?

SEMESTER

First, there exists a great dif-
ference in the number of hours
of classes depending on the dis-
cipline of the student. . The
sciences are much more rigor-
ous than the letters. In the first
year of most sciences a student
is likely to have twenty-five
hours of classes a week, where-
as in letters he may have as
little as seven. But the distri-
bution of these classes is what
makes life difficult. Most class-
es meet one hour a week, and
the classes may be distributed

is im-

there is

throughout the week on any day
from eight o'clock in the morn-
ing up to eight o'clock at night.

What happens so often is that
the distribution of classes is not
favorable for the student and
he is left with long breaks be-
tween classes, or even short
breaks which can be more an-
noying considering the fact that
the student may live three or
four miles from the *‘Faculte’’
and there is generally no place
provided to study nearby.

Meal time (two times a day

most French students provide
their own breakfast-—-what little
there is of it) means another
ten minute walk fifteen-
minute bus. ride just to get
the restaurant where it is often
necessary to stand in line for
at least fifteen. minutes. What
he waits for is not so bad, - es-
pecially considering the quantity

and the, price of 1 F 30, or, a
little more than 30. cents ‘that
he pays for each meal.

LACK OF CENTRALITY

Thus, it is in the lack of cen-
trality or. the “‘campus system”
that the French student is forced
into inefficiency. Many students
are, however, against the cam-
pus system and the attempts to
create it in France, as. they
fear a separation from the life
of the city, fleeing into a closed
society of students,

The typical school day of
a French student is a mix-
ture of classes, girls, study-
ing, and cafes.

Quite contrary to the con-
dition at Davidson, he can
proportion his time among
these aspects of his life in
any way he chooses, since
he has very little weekly or
monthly academic obliga-
‘tions with only the very im-
pelling necessity to pass the
yearly examinations.

Furthermore social clubs
and or tions such as
our fraternities do not ex-
ist, thus leaving the student

completely independent and
anal ted, except possi-
bly to fiancee or petite
amie.

The most convenient meeting
place for students are the uni-
versity restaurants which are
quite large and accommodated
with cafes, juke boxes and pin
ball machines; incidentally pin
ball machines are a very popu-

lar form of entertainment, and
large groups can always be
found clustered around a game.

French couples usually amuse
themselves supper by
going to a movie or to one of
the many sidewalk cafes around
the center of town, where be-

Saturday night for the stu-

just as it is at Davidson and
probably everywhere else. Using
cafes for gathering places after

supper, the students collect and |

intimate night clubs which are
quite descriptively called

“caves.” One actually has the
sensation of being in a glorified ©

The following articles are presentedto create
interest and a tingling of inspiration for the would-

be Davidson Junior Year

Abroad-er, to suggest an

answer for the critic who labors under the possible
illusion that the 50 shaded-acres at Davidson ALONE
can best suffice anyone’s four year liberal arts edu-
cation, and to express to the college and its officials
a commonly shared gratitude for this opportunity
of travel and study by those students in France at

this time.

After two years of closely supervised and rigidly
controlled book-reading at college, the time is ripe
for a student to take the opportunity and assess
what he has derived from his completed studies. The

student should hope to be

able to display more than

a mere diploma at the conclusion of four years;
he should also hope to defend his college education

more convincingly than to

claim that in our modern

utilitarian society, a certain amount of higher edu-
cation is necessary in order “to succeed.
If education is to be a growing experience

which is influential in the
ly conducted life
means and social status in

molding of one’s personal-

not just controlling his financial

later life, the contribution

of study abroad is of paramount significance.
Travel and study are fatal to. prejudices and

narrow-mindedness, both

of which often hamper

and restrict the overall development of an indivi-
dual’s capacity, and therefore directly bear upon
the total benefit to be gained by spending four years
in liberal arts study. To advance one’s real un-
derstanding further and deeper than mere book-
learning alone, one should establish a working sup-
plementary relationship between academic work and
personal living experience, explicitly because this
relationship inherently recognizes that the enrich-
ment of one will parallel the advancement of the

other.

Travel and life in
culture bring on face to face
with the application of would-be
dry and removed academic
theories within a new context
that readily calls for one’s ef-
fert to match the moment that
infermation drawn from. the
past: for example in visiting a
historical shrine, in seriously

their country's position dur-

In closing I would like to
add that one of the most re-

of 20,000 students of a com-
pletely different background and
tradition is that beneath the
superficial variances of insti-
tution and custom, one finds the
same human instincts and traits

of personality as at home.

That two fraternit

to lead a Montpellier team into
a regional tournament, with a
trip to the French nationals at
Paris hinging on the outcome,
points out that university sports
in France do not even receive
the attention or spectators that
the IMAC does at Davidson.

With les Programmes Cultur-
els however, France offers a
satisfying contrast to the crea-
tive and expressive atmosphere
at Davidson. In Montpellier, an
almost unimportant French pro-
vincial town, many miles from
Paris, this season at the large
opera packed-houses have al-
ready seen operas like Faust,
Rigoletto, Carmen, La Traviata,
Werther, and Manon; plays like
Corneille’s Horace, Moliere's
Les Femmes Savantes, Racine’s
Britanicus, Chekov’s Sea Gull;
and concerts by touring cham-
bre orchestres from Versailles,
Toulouse, Munich, and Ham-
bourg.

Often poetry reading honoring
modern French poets like Apol-
linaire and Eluard are present-
ed, and the local musee contains
works of Delacroix, Reubens,

special exhibitions from time
to time.

NOTED IN PASSING

There are two more points to
be noted only in passing. Many
of the students over here at this
time felt last year before leav

REPORT
FROM
FRANCE

This is the first of a two-!
part report from the David-
son group studyin in France. |
The final report will be pub- |
lished next week.

The Junior Year Abroad |
program is in its first year |
at Davidson. One gruop is|
studying in France while an. |
other group is studying in
Marburg,

|
Germany.

Accompanying the students
in France are Dr. and Mrs.
|Francis Ghigo. In Marburg
are Dr. and Mrs. Thomas O.

Pinkerton.

Anyone interested in  par-
ticipating in the program
next year should immediately
contact Dr. Joe O. Embry,
| chairman of the faculty For-

eign Study Committee.

The other point concerns the
fact that the students over here
have appreciated and made use

of this occasion to become ter
friends with each other, not
restricted by the superficial
fraternity classification —sys-
tem or the ‘zip’ or “flit” cate-
gorical considerations which
usually determine most close

friendships at Davidson.

Everything malheureusement
cannot be said concerning the
study program in France with
Davidson students, The twelve
students and the professor and
his wife would like to offer
these pictures and articles as a
token of appreciation for the col-
lege sponsored program—THIS,

David, Courbet, and Utrillo, plus our Junior Year in France.
