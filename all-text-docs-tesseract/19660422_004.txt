DAVIDSON RELAYS TOMORROW

Trackmen Host Tough Field

By BOB REID
Davidsonian Sports Writer
Nineteen teams will partici-
pate in the eighth annual David-
son Relays tomorrow. The first
events will get underway at 1:30

p.m.

“I'm afraid it looks like East
Tennessee State will sweep the
field again this year,” sighed
‘Cat track Coach Heath Whittle.
“I don’t think that anyone can
even provide them with interest-
ing competition.”

“I saw East Tennessee win the
News-Piedmont Relays down at
Furman a few weeks ago,” con-
tinued Coach Whittle, ‘‘and I
was very much impressed. They
did very well at the VMI Indoor
Relays several months ago
against such tough competition

as Carolina and Maryland.”
RELAY STRENGTH

“East Tennessee's strength
lies in their relay teams,” ex-
plained coach Whittle. ‘’Since
we award ten points for first
place winners in relay events
while only five for field event
winners, it really pays to have
strong relay teams. I expect
East Tennessee to take every re-
lay that they enter.”

Second place honors look wide
open this year with Frederick,
Lenoir Rhyne, and the Wildcats
as probable contenders. The
‘Cats capped six straight relay
crowns until the Buccaneers
stole their top spot honors last
year by a three point margin.

The Wildcat track team lost a
dual meet'to Wake Forest last
Tuesday afternoon 99-16. To add.
to the defeat, the freshman Wild-
Kittens were also upended 78-55
by the Wake freshman.

A few of the individuals ‘who
brightened this otherwise dis-
mal day for the Wildcats were
Randy Randolph who scored
first place finishes in the shot
put and the discus and a third
in the javelin, and Star Evins
who won the 220 yard dash.
Many of the winning times were
a little slow due to the light
rain that fell throughout the
meet.

In other running events, Andy
Little placed second in the two
mile run and third in the mile.
Bob Myers was second in the
440 followed by John Flowers.

Evins and Tom Caldwell came
in second and third, respective-
ly. in the 100 yard dash, and
Barry St. Clair placed second

in the 880.
Lou Hill was Davidson's sec-
ond high point. man with a first

‘in the broad jump and seconds

in the triple jump and the high
hurdles. Billy Blackstone also
picked up three points with a
second in the pole vault.

David Brown picked. up points
for thirds in the high jump, the
triple jump and the intermedi-
ate hurdles. Billy Blackstone al-
so picked up three points with
a second in the pole vault.

For the freshman, Greg Cox
did his usual fine job as he won
two events and had second place
finishes_in_two -others.—-

Other freshmen winners for
the Wildkittens were Bill Bryan
in the discus, George Rogister
in the high hurdles and Wayne
Huckel in the javelin throw.

Bryan's and Huckel’s winning
distances surpassed the winning
throws in the varsity meet.

“pat

battle for second and third
places," commented Whittle,
“but I'm not really very opti-
mistic about our chances this
year. This is just not our season.
We've got some real strength in
field events, but I’m afraid we'll
be hurting in the relays."

Some of that Wildcat field
strength includes junior Lou Hill
in the broad and triple jump
events. Hill has jumped over 22
feet this year, inches shy of the
meet record set last season by
Sam Holcombe of Lenoir Rhyne.
Hill has leaped 43 feet in the
triple jump, one foot short of
the meet record.

Also beefing up the field de-
partment will be Bill Kendrick
in the javelin throw and Bill
Randolph in the shot put. Ran-

dolph's best put this season was
44 feet, but he'll have to beat
that if he expects to top the
meet record of 48 feet, 8 inches.

RECORDS FELL

Last year six track records
fell by the wayside, as competi-
tors set new marks in the 2 mile
relay (Davidson), 880 yd. relay
(East Tenn.), Sprint Medley
(Cumberland), 440 yd. relay
(Davidson),

\

distance medley .
(Davidson), discus (Andy Boggs :
of Davidson), high jump (Keith -

Fraser of Davidson), and pole ~

vault (Davidson, East Tenn.,
Lenoir Rhyne).

The longest standing record is
the javelin (192 feet, 1 inch),
set by Ken Rohnke of Washing-
ton and Lee in 1959.

Spring Practice Continues
As Coaches Sight Season

By CLIFF DUKE
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Spring practice for football players is a time for the drudgery of conditioning,
running and contact executed beneath a hot sun one day and spring showers the next.

For coaches it is a period of
evaluating and _ indoctrinating
the athletes who will compete
under autumn’s skies in the
name of their school.

For next fall's aggregation of
Davidson Wildcats, this spring
involves adapting offensive and
defensive systems to the per-
sonnel. ‘‘We'll line up different-
ly this year because we have to
plan our game around what
each of our players can do,”
commented Coach Homer Smith.

One change already made has|
been scrapping the tweener
back. *‘We have no big blocker
to adequately fill that position.”
Innovations which are being ex-
perimented with now may result
in a more wide-open attack next
fall.

_ As illustrated by the practices
thus far, the Wildcats can once!
again rely on hustle and desire
to compensate for the lack of
depth.

While the staff is pleased by
the squad's attitude, Coach
Smith stated, ‘‘Almost everyone
is having to learn more than one
position during spring practice,
and most of them are learning
offense and defense. We plan to
platoon next fall, but some w
go both ways.” °

In the same vein, he added,

“I can't imagine anyone I see
out there now not playing next
year. The freshmen are progres-
sing well, and all of them will
get plenty of experience. The
play of freshman John Slaugh-
ter, our smallest lineman, has
been pleasing.

“I doubt if any group ever
faced a bigger challenge than

this team will face next fall.”

How are these Wildcats pre-
paring for this task? ‘‘By hard
work on fundamentals,” replied
Coach Smith. ‘So far we have
had no serious injuries. We are
staging a minimum of scrim-
mage—working in a few plays
and defenses during each ses-
sion.”

EDDIE RICE PASSES BATON TO TONY ORSBON
Wakies Take Freshman Track Meet, Too

MEETING GA. SOUTHERN AGAIN
Basemen’s Cold Bats Bow

To Wilmington, Richmond

Disaster struck the Davidson Wildcats this week as they suffered defeats at the
hands of Wilmington and Richmond in what were once the friendly confines of Wild-

cat Stadium.

Wilmington came to town with
a polished team on Spring Frol-
ics weekend. The ‘Cats’ pitch-
ing was, according to Coach
Tom Stevens, ‘good enough to
win on both days,” but the Sea-
hawks’ pitchers threw too many
curves for the weak ‘Cat stick-
men.

WILMINGTON PREVAILS

On Friday Howard Bryan
pitched his usual fine ball game,
but had no support from the
bats and suffered a‘4-1 defeat.
On Saturday Charlie Elliott and
the Seahawks’ pitcher, Braxy
Braxton were deadlocked 1-1 go-
ing into the tenth inning. With
two out and one man on by vir-
tue of an error, shortstop Butch
Harris jumped on a_ hanging
curve ball and put the game
(and the ball) away for the Sea
hawks, 3-1. Again, needless to
say, the bats didn't seem to
have any hits in them.

On Tuesday the Wildcats took
on Southern Conference foe
Richmond, and again, met with
bat-trouble. “But the mental
lapses (especially on the bases),
and the physical errors (four in
one inning) killed us like they
have in six or eight games this
season,"’ commented Coach Ste-
vens. Bryan was again a 4-1 vic-
tim. Poor baserunning choked
off what might have been a Iast-
inning rally.

‘Cats fell victims of fielding sui-
cide, 8-4. This left the team with
a 3-5 conference record and a
7-15 overall book.

This Friday and Saturday,
Georgia Southern will invade
Davidson for two games. They
have an experienced, talented
team which is always good.
“They have the best defense of
any team we've seen this year,”
Stevens pointed out. But though
the "Cats fell to them 12-1, the
team feels that they can beat
the Eagles. However, as Coach
Stevens explained, “If Georgia
Southern gets beaten, you have
to beat them; they don’t beat
themselves like we often do."

The Eagles are led by short-
stop John Szotkiewicz, a great
glove man and a dependable hit-
ter. Wilmer will probably pitch}
for the ‘Cats Friday, with Bry-
an going on Saturday.

BELMONT TUESDAY
On Wednesday the team jour-

Davidson's ROTC rifle team
finished well in the Southern
Conference and the Army tour-
naments at the close of the sea-
son. The straight-shooting squad
redeemed a dismal 3-9 regular-
season record by its perform-
ance in these tournaments.

The Wildcats were fourth in
the Southern Conference tourney
behind West Virginia, VMI and
The Citadel. This tournament
was held March 5, on the Fort
Lee, Va. range.

The marksmen of Major Har-
old J. Fraley and Sergeant Hen-
ry Eaves brought in a first place
in the Third US Army Sectional
Tournament, a_ second in the
NC State Invitational tourney
and a fifth in the Western Caro-
lina Conference meet.

Bolstering the team's hopes
for next year will be Walter
Eastes, this year's second high-
est average shooter with a sea-
son mark of 248, Frank Powell,
Art Abplanalp, Alex Riddle and
Mike Yarborough. Gone will be.
this year's top shooter, Jim
Kopp. Kopp sported a 262 aver-
age for the season.

About his team, Sergeant
Eaves commented, ‘‘The team
did very well in the tourna-

ments this year. Major Fraley -

and I are very pleased with this
performance. Next year’s team
should be really fine with the
help of experienced varsity shots
and some promising fresh-
men.”
