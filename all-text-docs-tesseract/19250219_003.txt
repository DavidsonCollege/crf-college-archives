Interviews With the Inteligensia

After many hours of waiting and standing
in a crowded hall, hungry and tired, the
writer of this article was able to get a few
minutes’ interview with C. R. Hunter, one
of the most intelligent men on the venrable
campus of dear old Davidson. I found Mr.
Hunter to be a very well dressed man, simple
in his tastes and appearance. One would
never think him guilty of the Honor Roll.
I was very anxious to hear of his past life
and just how he has achieved the ultra-im-
possible.

So T was cheated out of my interview.

Finding Mr. MeSwain proved easy, but
getting an interview proved harder. His ex-
treme modesty would not allow him to talk.

At first T received no answer, but on re-

I rushed through the open door to get a
last word. A most heart-breaking and _piti-
ful spectacle greeted my eyes. There on the
little white cot lay the man to whom the
whole world would have appealed in an in-
tellectual crisis, white, thin and gasping his

A muttering among the attracted

“Graves, Graves, Graves,” muttered the
crowd,

“Who is Graves?” I asked.

“The cause of our loss, the brute, the low

usurper.”

T saw that a riot was impending, so T took
myself away to look for this terrible Graves
who had caused this catastrophe that was so
appalling.

I approached the hall Georgia
around this handsome gray building,
with its green bushes and bright shrubbery.
I found a second crowd, far different than
the one at the home of The Great One. Thi

they kissed each other, some fainted out of
sheer joy. I heard the name of Graves re-
peated over and over.

I rushed in the elevator which carried me
to the third floor, where I was met by an
armed guard. I showed my reporter’s card

ADVICE TO GIRLS WHO WRITE
US LETTERS

If you ee save ink, at least don’t use
“c” for “see.”

somebody else. We can’t help it.

Don’t underscore words. We are far

Don’t give the excuse that you have
some others to write to. That doesn’t
compensate for only thirty-three words

weather so don’t tell us about it. And
if it makes you feel blue it’s all the same
