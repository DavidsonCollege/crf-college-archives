THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, MARCH 14, 1994 ‘

Recently, when a sensible male
friend asked me if I was “one of
those feminists,” I began to ques-
tion how much the average person
understands about the women’s
movement. My supposition was
confirmed when he continued, “I
mean, do you shave your legs?”
If we are following my friend’s
definition, I must deny the femi-
nist claim. I must also denounce
the array of negative images that
you conjured up in your mind when
you read the word “feminist.”
‘These images might be appropri-
ate for some feminists, but in the
broader sense, they have nothing
to do with my goals or the goals of
the women’s movement.
Contrary to popular belief,
many. feminists believe that men
should be the head of the house-
hold. Many would be happy to
devote their lives to their husbands
and children instead of to a career.
Many are conservative, traditional
women: who melt at the idea of a
bouquet of roses from a man. I, for
example, fit into this category.
By definition, feminism is the
belief that women should be given
rights equal to those of men, such
as equal wages in the work place

and equal representation in gov-
ernment. All other personal be-
liefs vary with the individual.
When Gloria Steinem makes nor-
mative claims about my morality
or my sexuality, she is stepping out
of line.

Having clarified our defini-
tion, I would like to add that femi-
nists can even be men.

the United Nations conducted a
study on women and girls in the
national context. Using such indi-
cators of well-being as literacy
rates, access to health care, politi-
cal representation, and economic
status, the report concluded that
women are less well-off than men
in every country in the world.

tion, Women for Economic Jus-
tice, discovered that women hold
two-thirds of all minimum wage
jobs, and women’s wages have seen
virtually no increase (in real dol-
lars) over the past 30 years. In
addition, the study stated that more
than half of all poor families are
supported by single women.

parents have the means to live well
to feel guilty. On the contrary,
more power to those who struggled
and made it. I’m just asking you to
look into the real world for achange
and realize there is so much more
out there and to understand that
“surplus” and “boom” are not the
prevalent terms being used by
today’s global economic analysts.

Finally, | would like to ad-
dress Mr. Barron’s comparison of
firing an employee for being gay
and firing an employee for being a
member of the KKK.

True, in the first instance, we
sympathize with the fired employee
because it’s not his fault he’s gay,
and after all, he probably doesn’t
go around throwing himself at ev-
ery same-sex worker he encoun-
ters.

We see the employer’s
homophobiaas irrational if the gay
worker’s sexual orientation is not
interfering with his work (just as a
heterosexual’s orientation should
not interfere with his/her work).

It is also true that in the latter
instance, we tend to sympathize
with the employer because the
KKK breeds hatred and injustice. I

agree, but it's still not right for the
employer to fire in either circum-
stance. I certainly am not advocat-
ing the actions of the Klan, but
quite frankly, if I were in the posi-
tion of the second employer, and
my employee’s personal pastime
activities were not in the way of
his/her work, I could not justify
firing him/her. ©

Now, don’t think I support the
Klan, but what I do believe is that
everybody deserves to be treated
equally and fairly on a non-biased
basis. The premise of this nation’s
freedoms are based on just that.
And while I may disagree with
(okay, hate) the Klan, the freedom
this nation gives me to express my
views is the same freedom that
allows such groups to exist.

Freedom in this country is not
discriminatory. Iteither exists or it
doesn’t. It’s ironic, though, that
the exact freedom that Mr. Barron
advocates taking away from cer-
tain individuals is the same free-
dom that allows people like him to
publicly speak their minds.

Or is it his opinion that only
white, Christian, straight males are
deserving of such liberties? Based
on the justifications his article of-
fers for discriminating against in-

nocent people, it certainly appears
that way.

No discrimination is right, just,
or fair. Just as you have the free-
dom to think and feel however you
do, remember that it is that same
freedom that affords everybody
else those exact same liberties. The
government has to play moderator
because, as we can see from Mr.
Barron’s enlightened viewpoint,
not all children play fair.

In closing, I would like to ask
Mr. Barron this: imagine you are
hired by this great law firm of
which I am the senior partner. After
a few years, you become a partner,
and I’m paying you at least a mil-
lion a year, and everything is great.

Ten years down the line, I
decide I hate people from Tennes-
see. Not for any particular rea-
son—I just decide one day that I
think they’re scum.

So, I fire you. (Because, al-
though your accent doesn’t give
you away, I somehow discover you
are originally from Tennessee.)
Are you saying, in following your
own stand on the issue, that you
wouldn’t take me to court?

Homeless women are at a dis-
advantage because most daytime
shelters are mixed or serve mostly

men. The staff member of one-

program for homeless women coin-
mented, “Women are not safe from
rape and abuse and are intimidated
about asking for what they need in
those shelters. Some spaces, such
as bars or pornographic movies,
where men spend time during the
day, are not available to homeless
women at all.”

Astaff person at another orga-
nization said, “The woman who
turns up at the door of a shelter is
one of the strongest women you'll
ever meet. She has survived to

show up.”

For men, poverty is often the
result of unemployment, and a job
isa frequently remedy. For women,
however, due to the wage gap and
labor market segregation, poverty
often remains even when the
woman works full time. |

Furthermore, jobs that do not
provide child care present an im-
possible barrier for poor single
mothers. U.S. women who work
outside the home still spend al-
most 3.5 hours doing housework
and child care for every hour that
men who are employed outside the
home do.

Feminists believe that ©
women’s and girls’ projects—non-
profit programs specifically de-
voted to improving women’s and
girls’ lives—could help to over-
come the severity of the. previ-
ously mentioned disadvantages
that women face. '

All stereotypes of feminists,
besides the belief that their goal is
to help women in need, are preju-
diced and usually false. Some femi-
nists have found that they must
speak up strongly in the face of
injustice, as did the female friend
of Holt Vaughan in the article he
wrote last week. Other people
address women's issues through
direct activism.

Regardless of their approach,
of their specific aims, or of whether
or not they shave their legs, femi-
nists share a vision: the overall
improvement of women's and girl's
well-being. Any other understand-
ing of the word "feminist" is a
misconception.

But these simple observations
fallshortof the greater truth. Walk-
ing is good because it is. It repre-
sents, at least (and maybe only) to
me, the striving-for excellence. I
walk because I can, some of the
time, anyway. Ifthere is any virtue
intrinsic in walking, that is where it
lies: the achievement of potential
in the face of abnormality.

But who does anything for
this reason these days? Do we do
even half of the things that we do

A cane is not a musical instru-
ment, although there is a rhythm to
it. Using it to walk is not what a
symphony is—it is not so expres-
sive of the human soul. But it is
expressive, it is mine, itis the thing
Ido--orat least one of them. Maybe
that is what the fundamentalists
mean when they speak of being

I think it’s what they should mean.

All I know is that the trick is to
be somehow as appreciative of the
sore feet as of the trees. Somehow,
life is good and painful, and these
are not opposites.
