A POINT FOR THE SYSTEM

Collegiate sports editors have an established habit
of picking out the weak points in an athletic program
and tearing that program to verbal shreds by harping
on these faults without mercy.

But there comes the time when the program
strikes back:

Sometimes it comes from the coach or the players,
who express dissatisfaction with the editor or his argu-
ments.

Sometimes it even comes from the over-eager
student fan, who supports his team through all of its
trying moments.

But there are times when the program strikes back
by itself without a word or complaint; it does it by
proving its worth. 2

The program struck back last weekend in Char-
lottesville.

It proved a few things, in spite of an overwhelm-
ing scoreboard defeat. There were faults. But the
program won last weekend.

The complaints that Davidson was in “over its
head,” which arose from the students and echoed in
Homer Smith, were valid. But the competition which
the Wildcats displayed matched the Cavaliers face to
face.

The defense allowed a Virginia record for total
offense, but it stopped Frank Quayle short of his prev-
ious rushing average. A few lessons were learned in
the defeat, and more than a few people are going to
be surprised if Davidson does not display the results
of this education against the Huskies from Connecticut
tomorrow.

The offense pounded out much more yardage than
anyone would have anticipated. Gordon Slade was in
top form against the .Virginia pass defense, which
ranked second in the nation last year.

And Kelly? Well, Kelly was Kelly, and once again
Homer Smith counted his blessings everytime Kelly
dragged a Cavalier defender toward the goal line.

The rest of the backfield, which could scarcely
move against Richmond the previous week, put out a
tremendous effort in piling up rushing yardage against
the biggest defense they will see all year. .

The lesson was not without pain. The loss of Sandy
Brenneman will be felt, but the ’Cats are fortunate
in having letterman Bill Gammon to fill his center
spot.

Indeed, the lesson was a hard one. The Cavaliers
played rough football, and the 267 yards in penalties
which they sustained testifies to something along this
line. But the Wildcats played some tough ball on their
own part, and they appeared more than ready to con-
tend with the remainder of their schedule.

Davidson probably will not win the rest of its
games this season, but the hopes for a happy homecom-
ing are high, - - ~

Slade and Kelly are ready; Homer Smith is ready:
Kerry Keith is ready; the defense is ready. It appears
that the whole program is once again ready. The dif-
ference this week is that the team is ready, not just
to play, but to win.

Win or lose, the program has proven its point. If
no one else is aware of it, at least one sports editor
knows the answer to the “Who is Davidson?” riddle
which plagued the Virginia gentlemen last week.

There will still be faults. There will still be sports
editors, and so there will still be criticism. In spite of
it all, though, there will still be Davidson football, and
occasionally a few pleasant surprises like Charlottes-
ville will still strike out to prove the system’s worth.
The more the merrier.

lowed this ‘break’? with a
35 yard ramble to put David-

Davidson's number one

cats seven more points in the
closing moments of the open-
ing half.

tunes did not end with the

age, Sandy Brennemen, the

ed senior Brennemen's foot-
ball career at Davidson.

The faulty block caused

Brennemen’s knee.

Commenting on the loss of
Brennemen, Coach Homer
Smith said, -‘I cannot ex-
aggerate how much we'll
miss Sandy as a blocker,
team leader, and a person."

Speaking of some of the
brighter points of last week's
encounter,
the offensive line did a good
job protecting Slade. ‘‘When
you consider they threw the
Purdue quarterback, Mike
Phipps, for losses a half a
dozen times, and so many
times against VMI, well..."

Speaking of tomorrow's.
clash with the Huskies from
Connecticut, Smith — said,
“They'll be spoiling for a
win."

Last year the Davidson
gridders had the honor of
ruining the UConns’ home-
coming with a 38-18 loss. and
they will be resiring to re-
turn the favor.

“They're a stronger team
than last year,’ Smith said,
“but it looks as if we better
win.”

Smith said that-

The prospects for the re-
mainder of the freshman
football team's schedule are
quite good, according to
Coach Gene McEver,

Despite a 38-17 loss to the
East Carolina freshmen, Mc
Ever had words of praise
for the team's effort. Ex
plaining that the defensive
team had only limited prac-
tice against the single,wing
offense used by East Caro
lina, McEver said they did
a good job against it.

Since Davidson had been:

playing together for a much
shorter time than their op
ponents, McEver conceded
that ECU had an advantage,
but said, ‘‘we did a lot bet-
ter than we thought we'd do.”

With ten minutes left, the
Wildcats trailed by ‘eight.

McEver singled out Robert’

Norris for ‘‘an outstanding
job at cornerback”’ and Greg
Sikes for a. “good job at

by Sikes set up Richard
Neal's touchdown plunge.

Jim Eltison scored the
other touchdown on a short
run. Harold Wilkerson kick-
ed both extra points and a
field goal. to complete the
scoring.

In terms of top prospects
for next year. McEver tabs
Frank McLaughlin, a 240

‘Yine prospect.”

Davidson Plays Host

By BOB DUNHAM
Sports Editor

The spirit of victory which
has become a -Davidson
homecoming tradition in the
past two years has a good
chance of returning tomor-
row, when the winless David-
son Wildcats meet the hap
less Huskies of Connecticut
at Richardson Field.

An improved Wildcat squad
will sezek its first win of
the season against a squad
which won its first game and
then dropped two straight.

The UConn Huskies bring
a moderate attack, a good
defense. and an explosive so
phomore into the game.

The offense was consist
ent against Vermont, when
the Huskies won 21.0, but it
slipped off in the losses to

‘aggressive, with lots of de-
termination’ and Steve Bald-

“the possibility of being a

points in the opener at East

fidently predicts an even
chance against the remain-
ing ‘teams on the schedule,

The Huskies rély on the
