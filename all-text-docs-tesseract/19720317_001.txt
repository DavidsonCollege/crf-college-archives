Governance: Problem Of Authority

By RICH WILSON
Editor-in-Chief

EDITOR’S NOTE: This is
the first in a series of arti-
cles entitled “‘Campus Gover-
nance: Crisis of Authority.”
The term ‘campus gover-

nance” has gained increased use
in educational journals and col-
lege newspapers during the past
decade as many boards of trus-
tees tangle with the crisis of
authority existent on college
and university campuses.

Campus governance essential-
ly means the exercise of author-
ity in a college or university.
The issue of campus governance
involves two basic questions:
Who makes the decisions, and
what is the process by which
these decisions are reached?

While the trustees are the ul-
timate source of authority, the
faculty has traditionally main-
tained supremacy in most aca-
demic decisions, with the ad-
ministration playing a secondary

role.

But in the decade of the ‘60's
American colleges and universi-
ties experienced a period of un-
paralleled growth and change.
These events brought about a
charge in the traditional pur-
pose of colleges in general.

Society placed increased de-
mands on these institutions to

provide services more than the
traditional discovery and trans-
mission of knowledge.

Such a trend resulted in a
shakeup of ideas on the campus
and a dramatic change from the
past.

As more students enrolled and
finances became more impor-
tant, the administration grew
increasingly larger and the pres-

ident was held increasingly ac-
countable for everything that

_happened on campus.

The faculty managed to re-
tain their power, but found
their autonomy challenged by a
budget-conscious administration.
Whereas previously the admin-
istration and the faculty worked
as a team to achieve the goals
of the college, the two groups
evolved different viewpoints.
Administrators questioned the
practice of tenure, while young-
er faculty members introduced
innovations in the learning proc-
ess and mew concepts of aca-
demic excellence.

The faculty was further chal-
lenged by students who felt that
they should have a voice in the

decision-making process.

The result of these trends was
competitive factionalism. Ad-
ministration, faculty and stu-
dents squared off against the
others. While each of the groups
harbored their own traditions,
the faculty especially resisted
any change which might alter
its identity or lose power.

Factionalism persisted and
dissension increased. While some
concessions were made, colleges
tended to lubricate outworn pro-
cedures. The struggle resulted
in riots and takeovers. Build-
ings were destroyed and presi-
dents held hostage.

When the smoke cleared, trus-
tees viewed the troubled situa-
tion and many initiated inquir-

ies into new forms of govern-
ing the campus.

While Davidson escaped the
riots, it did not escape the fac-
tionalism with each of the con-
stituencies bitterly sniping at
the others.

Recognizing the problems, the
board of trustees in the spring
of 1970 established a trustee
governance committee which
would study new modes of fov-
ernance and bring recommend-
ations to the board.

The committee, consisting of
one trustee, one student, one
faculty member, one administra-
tor, and chairman Walter L.
Lingle submitted their first set
of recommendations on student
conduct to the board last spring.

Once the board had adopted
their recommendations, they en-
larged the committee to three
members from each of the con-
stituencies and the board direct-
ed the committee to begin de-
liberations on the total picture
of campus governance.

To date the committee has
discussed the problem of gov-
ernance at Davidson and has
suggested areas in the decision
making process where the vari-
ous constituencies should exer-
cise primary leadership.

In the articles of this series
THE DAVIDSONIAN hopes to
investigate and discuss the prob-
lems in Davidson's current
governance system as well as
possible alternatives.

College Faces Possible Deficit For Year;
Bevan, Cornell Declare Fiscal Cutbacks

By ALEC HOON
Managing Editor

Davidson College might face
a deficit of as much as $100,000
during the current fiscal year,
according to College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

This possibility was announced
in a memo issued from the Pres-
ident’s office to all faculty and

staff on Monday.

Spencer instructed his two
Vice Presidents, John M Bevan
and C. David Cornell, to ‘‘take
whatever steps are necessary to
keep us operating in the black.”

Cornell has ordered cutbacks
on supplies, as well as on long
distance phone calls and all
non-essential travel.

Senate Opposes Calendar

By MIKE TANNER
Asst. Managing Editor
In this week’s meeting of the
SGA Senate, the disapproval of
the academic calendar propos-
ed for the 1972-1973 school year
by the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee (FEC) occupied the cen-
ter of attention.

The calendar issue was
brought up when Freshman
Senator Vince Rabil introduced
a resolution which would pro-
vide for the beginning of classes

-of the winter term of 1973 on

Wednesday, Jan. 3 rather than
on Tuesday, Jan. 2.

ORGANIST COMPOSER

Davidson College organist Wilmer H. Welsh will present the pre-
miere of his New York ‘‘Concerto for Organ and Orchestra”, at
a recital in the Davidson College Presbyterian Church tonight.

primarily forthe safety of stu-
dents who otherwise would be
forced to travel back to school
on the dangerous New Year’s
weekend.

Upon the passing of Rabil’s
resolution, SGA President Ralph
Peeples expressed his desire to
see the Senate take a definite

. Stand on the calendar, either

pro or con, and if necessary, to
qualify that standing.

The senate members immedi-
ately voted disapproval of the
calendar and went on to elab-
orate on the specific areas of
difficulty.

The specific points of conten-
tion receiving censure included:
1) the late start, 2) the lengthy
Christmas vacation and 3) the
late recess in the summer.

The Senate did express ap-
proval of the Freshman Confer-
ence Recess in the fall of next
year and went on to make the
following recommendations for
an acceptable calendar: 1) a
maximum of 17 days for Christ-
mas vacation; 2) a spring break
not coinciding with the conclu-
sion of the basketball season; 3)
a longer Thanksgiving recess,
and 4) a split winter term.

Time was also given in this
week's meeting to pass a mo-

‘tion introduced by Freshman

Senator Bob Corlew which
would charge the Senate to see
to it that next year, in the ab-
sence of a union, an adequate
(See SENATE, Page 10)

He has also put a freeze on
the hiring of new personnel, and
hinted that some non-academic
people might be laid off under
the new budget.

‘“‘We’re not kidding. We have
a tough situation here. I think
that too many people have been
complacent too long about our
financial situation.

“I am looking at every pos-
sible way we can decrease our
spending in order to insure that
we are not spending money
needlessly,” Connell said.

Bevan indicated that he was
requesting that all department
heads and administrators limit
their budgets as much as pos-
sible.

“I have asked them to be as
cautious as possible so as to
avoid a deficit that would be
disconcerting,” Bevan said.

Reaction among faculty to the
possibility of a deficit has been
mixed. Most have shown a ‘wait
and see’ attitude.

SGA President Ralph Peeples
expressed some concern over
the possible effects that the def-
icit would have on student-ori-
ented programs.

“The news of an impending
deficit is of concern to us all.
It is especially alarming to stu-
dents in light of past experi-
ence, which has shown that
when such a crisis exists, stu-
dent-oriented programs are usu-
ally among the first to be cut,”
Peeples said.

The major effort presently be-
ing made to reduce all deficit
has been to try to increase the
Annual Fund, which is solicited
through alumni contributions.

The goal for this year’s fund
(which ends on June 30) was
set at $310,000. As of now, only
$135,000 has been collected.

To stimulate donations, the
trustees of the college have of-
fered a $35,000 challenge to the
alumni. Under the terms of the
challenge, for each dollar that
a new donor gives, the trustees

will add two dollars to the fund.

The trustees will match dollar
for dollar every donation that
an alumnus, who has given in
past years but not this year,
makes.

In addition, the trustees will
match an increase in an alum-
nus's giving this year over last.

Director of the Alumni Fund
Howard Arbuckle was excited
with the new prospects the trus-
tee challenge gives to hopes for
reaching the Fund goal of $310,-
000.

“The trustee challenge is un-
precedented here at Davidson.
It will give us new leverage in
our fund raising efforts,” Ar-
buckle noted.

He explained that both the re-

Duncan To Resign
From YMCA Post

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Staff Writer

YMCA President Larry Dun-
can will soon resign his office
due to health reasons. He has
an ulcer.

Former President Adrian
Long will immediately reassume
the presidency for the spring
term. Duncan hopes that he will
be able to return to that posi-
tion next fall; however, until
then he will not totally refrain
from participation.

His role, though, will be con-
fined mainly to the Relivious
Policy Council. Long will as-
sume all administrative respon-
sibilities. ,

Duncan indicated that Paul
Yarbrough, YMCA Vice Presi-
dent, will remain in his present
capacity of organizing next
year’s fund drive. However,
if Duncan is not able to
return to the presidency next
fall, Yarbrough will replace the
graduating Long as presicent.
