- Liner Notes

Wynton Marsalis
Black Codes (From The Under-
ground)
Columbia, FC 40009
By JEFFERY M. BROWN

Black Codes (From the Un-
derground) represents a high
point in the career of trumpeter
Wynton Marsalis. Previous’ re-
cordings displayed his remarka-
ble musicianship, but his com-
positional efforts did not rise to
the level of his stunning virtuos-
ity. With Black Codes, the
young darling of jazz has con-
jured a formula which combines
excellent compositions and
superb musicianship. The result
is bewitching.

The liner notes inform us
that Black Codes represents a
rebellion against ignorance,
whether self-imposed or as the
result of racial stereotypes
(hence the album’s title.) The
seven selections hardly qualify

as rebellious, however. Instead,
Marsalis has looked to the past
for inspiration, specifically, the
1960's. It was during the 60's
that the unique “Blue Note
Sound” emerged (on the Blue
Note jazz label.) Herein, artists
such as Freddie Hubbard,
Bobby Hutcherson, and Wayne
Shorter made their most pro-
found musical statements. It is
here that the heart of Black
Codes lies, although this superb
album hardly rehashes tried and
worn musical formulas.

“Black Codes”, the title
selection, starts things off with
a driving, rhythmic theme that
underlies the entire song. The
musicians, which include the
dynamic, often uncanny Bran-
ford Marsalis (saxophones),
Jeff (Tain) Watts (drums),
Charnett Moffett (bass), and
Kenny Kirkland (piano), man-
uever brilliantly between the

hard-driving opening theme and
a subtle, compulsive, swing
tempo. “For Wee Folks” begins
as a ballad but progresses into a
haunting 6/8 feel which recalls
Wayne Shorter’s “Footprints”.
Wynton Marsalis’ increasing
ability to weave different com-
positional themes, all the while
remaining concise, proves to be
the album’s most engaging
asset. Earlier efforts too often
revealed his inability to exercise
that essential compositional
skill, economy.

The side ends with “De-
Ifeoyo’s Dilemma,” arguably
the best song on the album.
Characterized by sharp, angular
lines, “Delfeoyo” serves as an
excellent example of Marsalis’
growing individuality as a
songwriter. Especially
noteworthy is the brilliant solo
of Branford Marsalis, possibly
his best work on the album.

Wynton Marsalis’ Black Codesbewitching

“Phryzzinian Man” leads
off side two. A quick, energetic
work, “Phryzzinian Man” rivals

“Delfeoyo” in its drive and en-
gaging chord structure.

“Aural Oasis,” an original
Marsalis ballad wavers in un-
certainty, searches for direc-
tion, but never rises to the level
of excellence established by the
rest of the album.

“Chambers of Tain,” the
most experimental selection on
the album, finds the Marsalis
brothers doing what seems to
come so naturally to them,
blowing like hell.

The album ends appropri-
ately with a piece entitled
“Blues,” a fitting reminder that
jazz began with this basic yet
often overlooked form.

Final accolades go to Bran-
ford Marsalis, a player who, in
my view, displays superior im-

provisational skills to his much-
heralded brother. His smooth,
angular lines recall a young
Wayne Shorter. But whereas
the young Shorter was rough
and jagged, Branford is clean,
graceful, elegant. His mastery
is often uncanny. The other
musicians provide more than
ample support for the Marsalis
brothers, especially _ pianist
Kenny Kirkland, who rarely
foils to enthrall and delight.

Wynton Marsalis finally
seems to have found his niche in
the jazz world. Although his
feet lie firmly in the past, his
musical sensibilities reveal a
sense of urgency that buds
brightly for the future. The
“Young Lion” roars loudly in-
deed with Black Codes, his
finest effort to date as a band
leader, and one of the finest jazz
releases in many months.

Trissy Lomax operates business from historic spot

By NELLE MCCORKLE

Cherry vanilla frozen yogurt
in Davidson? The sign on the old
wooden door may seem startling,
but health food (or ‘gourmet
boutique” items, as owner Trissy
Lomax prefers) is available at
Natural Resources on Main
Street. Located opposite the town
green, the business expanded this
month into a restaurant by adding
four tables for lunch customers,
while retaining its coffee, pack-
aged food products, and baskets.

“I’ve never wanted it to be a
health food store,” Lomax said. “I
would go in health food stores
where they began in California
and see the most sterile places.”
Determined that her approach to
nutrition be different, Lomax
said, “There are very few purists
and vegetarians in the world. I be-
lieve it’s all put here for us and all
good.”

“The bug was put in my ear by
lots of friends,” Lomax said of her

decision to open Natural Re-
sources in 1980. “I had always
been interested in good nutrition,

especially as a way to good health.
For my own two children, when
they were growing up, I baked
bread.”

Natural Resources originally
stocked cheese. “Everybody said,
‘Why don’t you make
sandwiches?’” ~=Lomax _ said.
“Then we had to take them out to
eat them.” Lomax kept a picnic
basket in the store before the re-
cent seating addition; she lent this
basket to customers wishing to
take lunches across to the town
green. “I lent it to a couple one
time going to the mountains for
the weekend.” Today, Lomax
proudly points out this wicker bas-
ket, now on the shop’s floor stuf-
fed with nutrition information fol-
ders.

One-third to one-fifth of Natu-
ral Resources’ business occurs
during December, Lomax said.
“Students are our steadiest cus-
tomers.” Sandwich sales com-
prise the major part of business.

Baked goods, prepared at Natural
Resources by baker Jean Dutterer,
coffee by the cup, and snack
mixes of nuts and raisins, are the
other top-selling items. The store
also. sells woven baskets and
North Carolina pottery. “I know
all the potters,” Lomax said.

Natural Resources’ building,
the store's location since its open-
ing, served within recent memory
as Wisteria Beauty Salon, The
Oasis, and Nationwide Insur-
ance’s Davidson office. Prior to
these occupants, the building con-
tained the Davidson police station
with an upstairs morgue, now re-
made into an apartment. Origi-

nally, a drugstore occupied the
building: Davidson resident New-
tie Deal Johnston remembers
drinking her first Coca-Cola at age
16 there, purchased from a travel-
ing salesman in 1908.

“I’ve tried to make it [the build-

ing’s interior appearance] a bit of

the new but some of the old nostal-
gia,” Lomax said. Vivid vegeta-
ble prints and artist's proofs by
Davidsonian Laura Grosch hang
over an antique mahogany church
pew Lomax bought from St. John
Newmann Catholic Church in
Charlotte. She transported the
pew in her Toyota Landcruiser
accompanied by a helper and a

live parakeet. “I fell in love with
the bird, and bought her before |
picked up the pew. I named her
Patty Pew,” Lomax said.

Born

in| Baltimore, Lomax

grew up in New Jersey. She came
to North Carolina to attend St.
Mary's Junior College in Raleigh,
where she played on an all-state
field hockey team. She graduated
from the University of North
Carolina and then moved to Lake
Norman from Charlotte in 1977
with her husband Henry and twe
children. The Lomaxes’ son,
Henry Jr., graduated from David-
son in 1978.

In off-hours, Lomax paints in
and she
swims, sings with the Charlotte
Oratorio Singers, and practices

ol watercolor; also

ballet at her home

“Edon't know if Pima walking
advertisement,” Lomax said, “but
I never get sick, Pm nota vegeta
nian ora health food addict Feat
anything and everything. I try to
cat fewer preservatives. T still eat
junk food I love hamburgers
and Bojangles chicken.”

’'M AN_
AIR FORCE
PILOT

There was a time way back when women in the Air Force did
the same things women did everywhere
ministrative positions. Those positions are still around, but for
women in the Air Force, the opportunities are endless. You'll find
women in almost every skill area and with the prestige and respon
sibility of leaders

Many of these women began their relationship with the Air
Force in college, as cadets in Air Force ROTC. We received $100
per month for expenses. And those of us on scholarship had our
tuition, books, and lab and incidental fees paid by the Air Force

If you're a woman interested in or attending college, Air Force
ROTC can make a big difference in your life) And when you
graduate, you may become an Air Force officer. The sky's the
