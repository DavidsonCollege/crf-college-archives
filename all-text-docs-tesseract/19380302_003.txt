Personally, we féel that the mis-

bit of her prestige by her latest
move, but others feel, perhaps
rightly, that the step will aid in the
preservation of world peace. To
find what some of the students
thought, we asked this question:

kinds of good people. One type,
he said, are those people who are

are spontaneous good people. This
