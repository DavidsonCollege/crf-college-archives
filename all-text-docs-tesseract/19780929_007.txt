Torrance speaks

By BILL PEEPLES

Albert Einstein once said,
“God does not play dice,” a
misunderstood statement about
quantum theory that caused
great thinkers of his day to lable
him a determinist.
“But he is a realist ;”’ said Dr.
‘Thomas Torrance Monday
night, in a successful attempt to
defend and clarify Kinstein’s
observation. Einstein’s contem-
poraries took a statistical ap-
proach to quantum stheory,
whereas the eminent physicist
called for investigating the in-
trinsic structure of nature.
Using quantum theory as an
analogy, the mild-mannered
Staley Lecturer from Scotland
suggested a.similar approach to
Christian theology, saying that
there is ‘‘an objective, dynamic
relatedness in the universe.”’

An order exists in theruni-
verse that denies the deduction
of ideas from appearances, Tor-
rance explained, just as ‘‘one
cannot deduce that a rectangle
is a rectangle from appearance,
but from intellectual interpret@-
, tion.’

“God does not wear his heart
on his sleeve,” the theologian/
“God is in
himself what he is to us.”

In the same manner, Jesus
must be viewed Christological-
ly, not historically, said Tor-
rance. ‘‘One must approach
Jesus thruugn an untological
depth,” he continued.

Employing one of many
scientific examples, Torrance
turned to a discussion of light.
He said, ‘‘Light is invisible, but
it is in the light of the invisible
that we see the visible. We can
rely on the order of the universe
just as we rely on the constancy
of light.”

Furthering the analogy, Tor- |

rance said that God is invisible
yet reliable in much the same

sense as light.

Barnes heads church

By SUZANNE NEWBERRY

Have you ever readied who
the small children emerging
from the BCPC during the
morning hours are?

Believe it or not, they are not
child prodigies taking advanced
courses at the college. Nor are
they miniature Presbyterian
monks out for their morning
méditation, which they resem-
ble during the winter with their

- hooded parkas.

They are aspiring young kin-

dergarten students, ambitious

to start their education at the
mature ages of three and four.

The school located in the
heart of the church building is
quite appropriately named the
DCPC Weekday School. It-is
directed by Ms. Pete Barnes
and sponsored by the church,
Although there is a tuition,
shcolarships are provided based
on need.

Women’s

By SHELLI BALLANTYNE
Staff Writer

Where there is a need, a’

group forms to fill that need.

Sue Ross, Associate Dean of
Students, has a hand in the
formation of many groups, es
pecially the female-oriented
ones. With relatively few wo-
men at Davidson she has found
that it is easier to identify these
needs and then get together to
talk about what can be done.
This has resulted in the forma-
tion of various women’s organi-
zations.

Rusk House, the women’s
eating house on the court, was
originally organized as a wo-
men’s center for the Davidson
community. The house is the

The children come from the
Davidson, Long Creek, West .,
Port, Huntersville and Lake
areas. Professional teachers) ' j
guide and teach the children
from nine o'clock to twelve
o'clock every Monday, Wednes-

day and Friday. There are two |

‘classes of children; one for the

three year olds and one for the.

four year olds.

. The purpose of the school,
says Mrs. Bunny Frey, teacher
‘of the four year olds, is to help
‘the children grow in love and
appreciation of themselves and
those around them.

There is a great emphasis on
creating and improving each
child’s self-esteem. The children
are given the maximurh amount
,of freedom possible, and the
jteachers readily listen to the
children’s suggestions.

The young students are en-
couraged to do everything of-
‘fered and to do things on their

main product of the now-de-
funct ‘‘Women at Davidson’’
group.

Brenda Stewart, president of .
Rusk House, has found that it
is difficult to act as a commun-
ity women’s center. But she
stressed that ‘“‘Rusk ‘would real-
ly like to be more than just an
eating house.’’ The various
functions at Rusk are open to
everyone but suggestions are
needed on how Rusk House
could work on being a better
women’s center.

One of the newest’ women’s
groups on campus is a chapter
of the National Organization for
Women (NOW). Nancy Warren
is responsible for organizing
this group. Warren feels that
NOW is needed in order to make

groups serve needs

the Davidson community more
aware of what the women’s’
issues are, especially concerning |
women’s athletics, compliance ,
to Title IX, discriminatory ad-
missions policy for women,
issues of ERA, and publicity for
ERA as North Carolina remains
_ State.

Also there is need for a group
that is just concerned with’
women’s issues. Warren has
found campus women very re-
ceptive to NOW. The atten-
dance at the first meeting far
exceeded her expectations.

Another club, the Women’s “
Interest Group, was first organ-
ized last spring term by a group
of women students in conjunc-
tion with a committee of the
Distaff Club.

The Distaff Club is an organ-
ization made up of women
associated with the college.
Their object is to ‘‘aid the
President and the Administra-
tion of the College in every
possible way and to promote the
friendly association of its mem-
bers.”” What this really means,
according to Mrs. Pam Ste-
phenson, is to ‘‘act as the
official hostesses of college
functions.”’

The:Women’s Interest Group
was seen as one possible way of
creating a situation where all

_women in the Davidson com-

munity were welcome to get
together to meet each other,
form friendships, and split up
into smaller groups where there
was common interest. Some
special interests that have been
suggested are discussion
groups, cooking, crafts, sports,
and travel.

Plans are now being made for
a revitalization of this group
during fall term and all women
in Davidson are invited to
become involved in whatever
aspect of the Women’s Interest
Group they are particularly
interested i IRs...
