The discussion of vocational] coun-
seling and placement service promp-
ted a brief tour through the college
catalog. Brief. because there wasn't
much to find describing these

programs. Descriptions of pre-
professional] programs abounded.

To the prospective student. the
Catalog seems to say that if you're
really interested in thinking about
things other that what your room-
mate is going to be like, then you can
ponder the fact that a lot of students
here are heading for medical school.
law school, seminary. business ad-
ministration programs. and
professional education.

And as those four years rush by.
you find that the catalog becomes
pretty useless. For those who haven't
committed themselves to graduate
study or training, the placement ser-
vice should become as watched a ser-
vice as the mail is for verdicts on
hopeful applications.

And the placement service is
hopefully more efficient. But you
have to dig to find it.

Presently, the college placement
service is run on a shoestring budget.
For what it has to work with, it does a
fantastic job. With only a portion of
her time available apart from her
Union duties, Suzie Summers handles
the scheduling of all interviews with
prospective employers who choose to
visit the campus. Her industry is
behind those lists of bankers and in-
surance agents that proclaim them-
selves in the announcement sheet
every week.

The surprising thing is that a
steady list is available every week.
The college doesn’t solicit these ap-
pearances; only the employers who

_ Choose to do so appear on campus on
their own initiative. If they don’t
come to you, you’re going to have to
find them elsewhere.

The vital need for this program
demands that the college concern it-
self with a revitalization of this
program. Presently, officials are
awaiting a response to a request for a
substantial Federal loan that would
fund an expanded placement
program for the next two years. A
full-time placement director would be
provided, and a correspondingly
diverse and effective program could
be achieved. But the college must ad-
dress itself to the possibility that this
grant won’t come through, or, more

directly, where the money is going to
come from twoyearshence.. .__

V ocationers

To answer this question, the college
must take a hard look at its
priorities. What is to be done for the
student who decides to call a halt,
momentarily or finally, to his formal
education after four years at David-
son?

The assumption at work is that
Davidson students naturally
gravitate toward positions of
professiona] skill and management.
This assumption must be radically
amended. No longer can an education
here be considered the first step to
distinction in a world of hierarchies of
success. Some may be content, even
thrilled, to perform simple and vital
tasks in which education can be con-
tinued in the diverse forum of living.

Pre-professional programs are
welcome and needed. The vitality of
the pre-medicine program attests this
fact. The pre-ministerial program
has caught this organizing ferver,
and it is rumored that the pre-law
program may not be hopelessly im-
mune to activity.

The Career Service program
provides an outlet for those who want
to give a certain job a crack right
away. Graduate study is a must,
however, and the danger is that it is
too hastily assumed that all want and
should go this way.

The college must prepare itself to
serve those who want to fish around in
waters outside of classrooms. To do
this, it is imperative that vocational
counseling be improved.

Currently, the College Counseling
Service provides some service in this
area, but it tries to pinpoint interests

instead of opening new fields where
interests may develop.

A full-time Vocational Counselor
could cultivate such a body of in-
formation and possibilities and make
sure that the students have a chance
to use it. The Placement Service
would then become not a place where
one looks for a safety valve, but a ser-
vice where one can seriously search
for a place that appeals to his/her
needs to expand education and ex-
perience through activity.

The Pied Piper need not chant the
same tune of study and success to all;
we face a world in which too many
scramble to play the music them-
selves. At least provide those who
want to study with some new
materials the chance to see what they

might grasp...

Letter To The Editor

Mitchell Attacks
Davidsonian Bias

To the Editor:

Your cartoon of the last
issue. concerning the on
of whether THE DAVID-
SONIAN ought to remain com-
pulsorily funded, brought to
mind some considerations
about the special nature of the
school paper. ont

These deeper aspects poin
up, I feel, some of the areas of
controversy over the proper
role of the paper, and the un-
derlying criticisms that many
of us harbor about the manner
in which THE DAVIDSONIAN
functions.

The editors of THE DAVID-
SONIAN jealously and
zealously guard their asserted
right to act after the fashion of
the ‘‘free Press’’ - for in-
stance, they consistently
editorialize about a broad
range of policy matters, both
school-wide and national in
scope, and they loudly and ac-
tively endorse candidates for
election in the SGA.

Yet, at the same time, they
vociferously demand to con-
tinue to be immune to the most
powerful check on the ‘‘free

Press’’--and that is the
necessity of selling their views
to their readers.

In a free society, ideas that
are shoddy and poorly ex-
pressed will quickly fail to at-
tract enough reader support to
facilitate their continued cir-
culation. In a very real sense,
the masses of readers sub-
sidize the views that they
judge to be worthy and ac-
ceptable by their very act of
buying a newspaper. The
“marketplace of ideas”’ in not
so separate from the real
marketplace!

A second crucial balancing
factor which holds the free
press at bay, but which THE
DAVIDSONIAN scorns, is the
responsibility of a paper to its
owners. A ‘New York Times’’
or a ‘‘National Review’’ must
needs expound and maintain a
consistent editorial policy
which strikes a delicate balan-
ce between what its owners
would like to say and what its
readers will let them say.

With these observations in
mind, how can THE DAVID-
SONIAN justify its policy of
endorsing candidates for SGA
offices?

There are two very basic ob-
jections to this policy that I
would voice. First, in a com-
munity where all of the
students own an equal share of
the paper. how can that paper
operate to use a student's
property to oppose his own
convictions?

A case in point: in last
December's elections, | sup-
ported Vince Rabil for the
presidency of the SGA I did
not appreciate your endorsing
his opponent, Blain Butner.
Mr. Rabil did not appreciate
it, and his brother Mark ob-
jected as well. Actually, the
Rabil family owns double the
interest in this paper as the
Butners--if anything, you
should have endorsed Vince!

But you shouldn't have en-
dorsed anybody, for this
second reason. How did you
come to be qualified and
called to sit in judgement of
your fellow students’
capabilities for office?

Sirs, this student body is, by.

virtue of the admissions

no intellect here so august that
the most ignorant of his
classmates requires his aid in

Do you believe in
democracy? You do not, sirs;
you cannot, for you will find
this dilemma inescapable:
Either you have no faith in the
students’ ability to select their
own choice without your sage
advice, and you know that by
endorsing a candidate you
adulterate the democratic
process by throwing a great
weight behind your hand-
picked man; or you think, on
the contrary, that your en-
dorsement does not sway the
result, in which case you are
fools to waste your time
writing the thing. And I know
you are not fools.

As your past editor said
(and I paraphrase): ‘This
paper endorsed no candidate
in 1972 and my man lost. Now
when I'm editor, we'll endorse
someone, and make damn
sure that doesn’t happen
again!"’ And he did.

The presumption, the
egotism, and the selfishness of
such a policy is evident. You
have no right to endorse can-
didates; you have no call to
send a blessing to the men of
your choice and to confound
the earnest and sincere efforts
of the men whom you do not
deign to smile upon.

I have the completest con-
fidence in our paper's ability
to collect and dispense the
news of our college com-
munity. Besides that, there is
so much that you can do, and
indeed have done, in
illuminating special student
concerns and investigating
and propounding new policies-
-Mr. Canterbury's efforts on
the laundry issue are a case in
point.

You are well qualified to
serve as a forum for student
opinion (on questions which
they can knowledgably and ef-
fectively address) , creativity.
and expression. Mr. Reed's
response to the laundry article
was genuinely well-argued
and informative and, as for
creativity and expression,
who can top C. A. and
Young Buck? Also you print
funny cartoons (! )

Do these things that you are
especially fitted for, by virtue
of that ‘special nature” of
THE DAVIDSONIAN. But
don't tell me how to vote, and
don't undertake to feed me
second-hand and third-rate
political ruminations.

Like many of the political
enthusiasts here, I find just
about all I require along those
lines over in the library. And
after reading ‘Time’,
“Newsweek”, “‘U. S. News”’
and ‘‘National Review” for
breadth, and following
Kilpatrick, the Alsops,

, and Evans & Novak
for depth, when I pick up the
Thursday Night Surprise and
see Nixon labeled a nasty
facist—well, I can only concur
with that illustrious past

editor of our staff, ‘The
bullshit has got to stop.”’
