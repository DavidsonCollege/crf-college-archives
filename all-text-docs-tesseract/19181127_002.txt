THE THANKSGIVING GAME,
In last week's issue of The Tiger,

Clemson's weekly paper, appears the fol-
lowing: “Davidson always put out a
scrappy team and have gotten away with
victories in the past two seasons; but be-
fore this, however, it has been customary
for the ‘Tigers to down the N.C. Pres-
byterians, Davidson has defeated Wash-
ington and Lee and the University of N.
C. this season, which shows they have a
good team. However, we also feel that
ave have just a little better one, and on
‘Thanksgiving the Tigers will give ‘em a
battle royal and we feel sure come out
victorious.”

We agree with The Tiger that there
will be a battle royal tomorrow, but we
do not agree with them as to the result.
We wish The Tiger to glance over the
following scores and decide for itself
whether “it has been customary for the
Tigers to down the N. C, Presbyterians”
or not:

In the past twelve years Clemson has
won two contests, Davidson four, and
three have been tied. The scores for the
nine games are as follows:

1906—Clemson,. 0: Davidson, o.
1907—Clemson, 6; Davidson, 10.
1908—Clemson, 0; Davidson, 13.
1909—Clemson, 17; Davidson, 5.
1913—-Clemson, 6; Davidson, 3.
1914-—Clemson, 0; Davidson, 0.
1915—Clemson, 6; Davidson, 6.

1916—Clemson,
1917—Clemson,
1918—Clemson

0; Davidson, 33.

A REMINDER.

As The Davidsonian goes to press the
campus has just been freed from the con-
finement. Whether the restrictions were
to be raised by tomorrow depended upon
the conduct of the companies and the
condition of the barracks. It’s up to the
battalion now to keep the campus
straight, and that depends on each in-
dividual man.

For one man to receive punishment
for his own delinquencies by undergo-
ing confinement or doing detail work is
one thing. But for that man to bring
down punishment on his squad, on his
company, or on the whole batalion by his
lack of interest is quite another thing
and just a little beyond the joking point.
Digging a trench for an afternoon, or
being confined to the campus for several
days is one thing. But having to stay on

‘| the country.

lough is something else. It’s time the
battalion worked up some public opinion.
Rap on the man who carelessly throws a
cigarette butt or scraps of paper on the
campus. It spells, ten, twenty, forty,
etc, days for you as well as for him.
After such a shaking up as the battalion
has received, any man who so endangers
the liberties of others is pretty low down

If Mr. Moore hated to leave David-
son as much as Davidson hated to lose
him—well, if it weren't for his strong
conviction that hé is needed worse else-
where, he would still be with us. He
had se worked himself into the hearts
of Davidson men that it was with the
sincerest feelings of regret that they
heard of his intention to leave. David-
son can feel herself fortunate to have
kept him as long as she did. He might
be called an ideal Y. M,C. A. man, just
the kind avho can best gain thé confi-

made Mr. Moore's stay a pleasant one,

THE ANNUAL.
Several of the twenty who “would be
Seniors.” while talking over things in
general, brought up the question of the
Annual, What about it this year? “The
verv idea.at first took their breath away.
What about the heavy expense? the lack
of time? and other drawbacks? Now
that the war's over it should be no more
trouble to finance it than in old times.
It is true it. is rather late to start such
a task, but of cotirse it would be impos-
sible to put out a book as large as is cus-
tomary. But an annual only half nor-
mal size, when published as a War Is-
sue, with the knowledge that eighty per
cent of the class that, put it out have
been in the service, will be of infinitely
more honor to that class than the finest
volume ever put out by any peace-time
class.
There's no other one thing in college

like an Annual to commemorate the do-

ings, organizations and individuals .of a
student body. It would be a pity for
the class of ‘19 to go out without leav-
ing such a volume as a record of its col-
lege career. Let's put out an’ Annual
this year, if only a small affair Won't

IN APPRECIATION.

To My Friends at Davidson:

T wish to take this opportunity to
thank my friends at Davidson for the
kind co-operation they have given me in
the two months 1] have been here as
Army Y. M. C. A. secretary. From the
officers and faculty down to the last
student there has been nothing but the
finest spirit shown me and the work I
have been trying to do. It is with sin-
cere regret that I leave Davidson. Sel-
dom have [ grown to love a group of
men as I have the ones here and they
will always hold a warm place in my
heart. The best I can wish for my
successor is that he may have the same
Christian spirit of co-operation that has
been shown me. God grant that the Y.
M. C. A. may prosper and be an effect-
ive force in helping Davidson College
mould Christian soldiers and citizens.

‘TAUGHT BY DR. CURRIE

It ts needless to say that the student
body is very glad to see Dr. Currie back
on the campus after seven weeks’ ab-
sence. Dr. Currie was one of the crowd
that had the “flu” and was very unfor-
tunate to have pneumonia set in after-
wards. Although Dr. Currie is _ still
weak, he is able to be up and meet one
or two of his classes,

which will be more appropriate since
war has been stopped. The course will
also take up fully the present peace con-

ORDER FOR MEN TO
O. ‘T. C. RESCINDED

Union Theological
Seminary

RICHMOND, VA.

As the companies were seated for the
usual Thursday morning lecture — by
Lieutenant Sullivan, we were interrupt-
ed by the call from headquarters for all
the men previsusly named for the Off-
cers’ Training Camps. They retired,
cheered by’ the entire body assembled.
But when they reached headquarters it
was announced that the called had ‘been
cancelled on account of the signing of
the armistice by Germany. The an-
houncement came as a disappointment to
some, arid were it not for the fact that
peace has come, it would have been a dis-
tinct disappointment to all of them.

The student body is most. fortunate
to be allowed to. retain such young men
as have proved themselves worthy of the
selection. And it practically means the
life of the football ream to retain Spann.
Crouch and George Robson. Let's all
give fifteen rahs for the O. ‘T. C. boys.
