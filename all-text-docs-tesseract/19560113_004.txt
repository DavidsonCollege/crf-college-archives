Psychology Unit
Visits Morganton

By JACK TRAWICK
That Davidson College was built by one of the female resi-
dents at Morganton, that persons have visited Mars, and that

|

we are all being bombarded by cosmotrons—such was the na-’
ture of the knowledge gained by members of Davidson's Ab-

normal Psychology class on a

recent trip to one of North

Carolina's state mental institutions at Morganton.

Other important data gathered
included the fact that Dr. W. G.
Workman has latent snow-man
charms, and that it appears that
some of the Morganton patients
should be on the outside and some
of us should be on the inside.

Approximately thirty Abnormal
Psychology students made the trip
and participated in an extended
tour of the wards of the institution.
A short eliriic was conducted by a
charming female psychologist, dur-
ing which two paranoid schizo-
phrenic cases made talks to the
students.

Possibly the most interest-
ing case observed during the
trip was that of a gentleman
whom we shail designate as
Ira. Ira, a middle-aged gentle-
man of short, stocky stature,
was one of the paranoid
schizophrenics who talked to
the group during the clinic
part of the trip. He was neatly
dressed in a coat and tio and
came equipped with a large
scrapbook which included in-
formation on practically every
well-known person in the scien-
tifie and religious areas.

Ira was stiffering from a slight
infection of the throat which
caused a barely noticeable hoarse-
ness. He promptly explained to us
that each time he was supposed to
make a talk “they” bombarded his
throat with sound waves in an at-
tempt to keep him from talking.
He apologized profusely for this
incapacitation.

He then proceeded: to explain

sheriff who had tricked her when:
she was brought to Morganton.

One of the s:udents asked her it!
she thought. she were going some-'
where, or just why she was wear-
ing a fur coat. She replied with a
touch of indignity, “Why are you
wearing a coat — it’s a bit chilly
out today isn't it?” When asked if:
she were not warm with the coat!
on inside, she replied that she was
—she did not, however, make any
motions toward removing the coat.
When she finished her talk, she:
turned to this student and said, “I:
just want you to know, that not
only am I.warm, I am incandescent
with anger!" She blew us a kiss
and gave. us a fond farewell, at the |
same time casting a particularly
affectionate look in the direction
of Dr. Workman. Roberta had been

but had to be returned when she
became violent trying to pursuade |
the management of a theatre in a
North Carolina town of her ex-!
ceptional dramatic talent. |

Then there was the case of Sally
who had built Davidson, had been
to Mars, and who had food stored
on the moon — “the moon is
burned out, and cold and I have

by cosmotrons and that flying; course of Sally's expatiation, an-

saucers were objects that were sent
out by men to harm other men. He
said that these men tried to lay
the blame for flying saucers on
God, but that. men are really back
of it all. We were also warned
against stoves made by Sears and
Roebuck that cook by light—they
“eook your brain.” Back in 1950,
Jesus Christ appeared to Ira and
imparted to him a vast knowledge
of things to come. When asked

what Jesus looked like, Ira pro-!and cared for, but that they had!

duced a picture of Jesus and then
pointed out the differences be-
tween this picture and the actual
Christ — “You must. remember
that this is merely an artist’s con-
ception.”

Ira said that there was no talking
done during this meeting, but that
all understanding was imparted
through the medium of signs and,
symbols — “Besides, I figured if
there was going to be any talking,

other young female patient came
up and told several of us not to

was also the gentleman who said
he liked Morganton very well, ex-

most of the patients were re-

THE DAVIDSONIAN

A SPORTSMAN'S
PRAYER FOR
1956

Dear God,

p

Dr. Scott has instigated only a
| few minor changes in the handling
‘of the team. As the Cat followers
have noticed, the Wildcats are now
using the’ fast broak. Scott prefers
this system of taking a chance at
an casy basket, and. then, if it
fails, running a set offense.

Specators have also noticed the
new score boards which give a
running account of the individual

Help me to be a sport in
this little game of life. I don’t
ask for any easy place in the
line-up; play me anywhere
you need me. I only ask for
the stuff to give you 100%
of what I've got. If all the
hard drives seem to come my
way I thank you for the com-
pliment. Help me to remem-
ber that You won't let any-
thing come my way that You
and IT together can’t handle.
And help me to take the bad
breaks as part of the game.
Hélp me to understand that
the game is full of knots and
trouble, and make me thank-
ful for them. Help me to get
so that the harder they come
the better I like it.

And. O God, help me al-
ways to play on the square.
No matter what the other
players do. help me to come
clean. Help me to study the
Book so.that I'll know the
rules, and to study and think
a lot about the greatest
Player that ever lived, and
the other great players that
we are told ‘about in the

the best part of the game
was helping the other guys
who were out of luck, help

me to be a regular fellow

set up the boards to heighten in-
terest by keeping the fans in-
-formed as the game progresses.

Dr. Scott has made his pres-
ence felt in almost all fields
of the athletic department. The
first of his new steps was the
revised athletic ability test
given at start of the semester,
The test takes into account
muscular feats, such as punt.
ing the football and throwing
the softball, more common
than those formerly tested.

The rule permitting juniors and
seniors, who can pass the athletic
test, to be excused from P.T.-was
instigated by Dr. Scott. However,
he would like to encourage those
students to participate frequently

in’ some sport of their choosing.

To encourage this voluntary
participation, the gym is being
left open as much as possible.
On recont afternoons the floor
has been filled with students
playing basketball,

Dr. Scott has a great fondness for
basketball. He twice made Kansas

beaten teams at Pittsburg State

Finally, O God, if fate
seems to uppercut me with
foth hands and I’m laid on
the shelf in sickness or old
age or something, help me to
take that as part of the game
too. Help me not to whimper
or squeal.that the game was

raw deal. And when, in the
failing dusk, I get the final
bell, I'd like to know that
