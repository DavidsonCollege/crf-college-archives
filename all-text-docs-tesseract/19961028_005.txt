Construction will not move

By Douc PENHALLEGON

Concerned seniors can relax;
this spring graduation will be held
in front of Dana Life Science build-
ing just like it has been for nearly
three decades.

Nelson Chandler, a senior and
student representative on the Board
of Trustees’ Building and Grounds
committee, reported to the SGA
that construction of ‘‘a substantial
addition in front of and joining
with Charles A. Dana Science
Building” will begin this spring,

“This undertaking will be the
‘major project’ for the comming

year. Groundbreaking, however,
will begin after graduation,” says
Chandler’s report.

Construction of the new Life
Sciences Building will perma-
nently change the site of the spring
graduation ceremony which as
been held in front of the Dana
building since the early 1970s.

Promising that the new site
will be somewhere on the front
campus, Registrar Polly Griffin
assures students that in the future,
Davidson will still have “the most
gorgeous graduation possible.”

Potential new locations for the
spring graduation ceremony in-

clude the area between Dana and
the Davidson College Presbyte-
rian Church, as well as the central
quad near the music practice rooms.

“We have a lot of room to
work with, but shade is a top prior-
ity,” says Griffin.

She is certain that commence-
ment will still take place some-
where in front of Chambers.

In addition, Griffin says, “The
construction of a state of the art
science building is imperative. The
sooner we can get started on that,
the better off are the students.”

The building will service the’
biology, physics, and psychology
departments.

Hook-up set for Feb?

Dates for dorm connections are uncertain

By ANN HATFIELD

Student representative to the
Trustee Committee on Buildings
and Grounds Nelson Chandler
says that students will be able to
plug into the Internet from their
dorm rooms within “a few years.”

However, the Director of
Computer Services, John Casey,
remains much more optimistic.

He says, “Knox, Irwin and
Akers will hopefully be on-line in
February 1997. We are complet-
ing the final steps before hiring a
contfactor and beginning con-
struction.”

Renovated this past summer
and outfitted with the necessary
fiber network, the sophomore
dorms will be the first to receive
Internet access.

Chandler issued a report to the
SGA which states that the commit-
tee discussed “the creation of a
fiber network connecting all build-
ings and dormitories on Davidson's
campus to a central system, giving
every student direct access to the
internet from his/her dorm room.“

“This project will take several
years to complete, but the first
stages will begin in the spring of
1997,” says the report.

Less students studying, more seeking salaries

sidered.
This may partly explain why
Tony Butchello recently assumed

‘the post of Assistant Director at the

Office of Career Services.
Butchello will work as a career
counselor, but because the market
for holders of bachelor’s degrees
“is a different landscape” than it
used to be, he says he’ Il “be work-
ing with the pre-professional stu-
dents,” specifically to raise test
scores and improve interviewing
skills, two elements that should
increase chances of admission to
selective graduate schools. Along
with program directors, Butchello
will advise students in the pre-law,
pre-management, pre-medical, and
pre-ministerial programs.
Butchello has begun working
with all the directors of the
College's pre-professional pro-
grams, including Dr. Jeremiah
Putnam, who heads the pre-medi-
cal program. Putnam says there
has been "a tremendous increase"
in the number of medical school

applications, noting that in 1988
26,721 people applied to Ameri-
can medical schools, whereas 1995
saw a record. 46,500 applicants
nationwide, all the while the num-
ber of seats remaining constant.

This intense competition,
along with Jordan's possible ex-
planations for delay in graduate
school entrance, may speak to the
recent drop in medical school ma-
triculants immediately after gradu-
ation, as reported by the Office of
Career Services. According to the
Senior Survey for the Class of 1994,
29 graduates were headed to medi-
cal school in the fall following
graduation. But in 1995, only 8
went right afterwards.

Still, these figures don't take
into account the numbers of
Davidson alumni who enter medi-
cal school every year, says Putnam,
who notes that he is "supporting
several students in the Classes of
1986, 1987, 1992, and 1994," He
also advises Davidson graduates
in non-health-related fields who

want to enter medical school,
among them a lawyer in south
Texas and a businessman in Vir-
ginia.

Some students believe that the
construction of pre-professional
curriculums and the current post-
graduate climate make direct entry
into graduate programs difficult.
Senior biology major and pre-med
student Ken May says that "It takes
a long time to do the requirements
[for pre-med]. You basically have
to get them finished your junior
year, if you want to go right on to
medical school."

May, who is waiting a year to
apply to medical school, says that
he took longer to complete pre-
med classes because he wanted to
devote more time toeachone. With
the pressure Davidson students feel
now, he says several professors
tell him they see no reason to rush
into the stressful world of medi-

cine.

"You might as well take some time
off," he says.
