Budget Calls For $200 Fee Increase

By BOB HOWELL
Managing Editor

The Comprehensive Fee has
been increased $200 for next
year--to $3590--as part of a $6.3
million budget approved by the
Board of Trustees this week.

A distinctive feature of the
budget is that the tuition and
fees segment of the total fee will
remain frozen for the next two
years at $2350.

Maintaining this figure,
which is up $110 from last year,
is ‘‘an effort to hold the line so
that those who come to David-
son from the middle income
brackets will not be squeezed
out,”’ according to Chairman of
the Board Warner Hall.

Other segments of the Com-
prehensive Fee, however, may
still be increased, he added.

Under next year’s budget, the
price of meals will rise by $30 to
$630, the room fee is up $50 to
$400, a $5 increase brings the
laundry fee to $130, and the
student activity fee remains
constant at $80.

Though these figures will be
flexible in the future, ‘‘It has
always been our policy to run
the auxilliary services to break
even, not to make money,” in-

dicated Vice President for
Finance and Development C.
David Cornell.

**We'll be all right this year,”’
he said. ‘‘What concerns me is
looking ahead to where we'll be
at this time next year."’

He estimates that the college
will have to come up with more
than $400,000, taking into ac-
count some $200,000 for faculty
and staff compensation in-
creases, $100,000 for the added
operating costs of the new
library, an inflation factor
amounting to around $80,000,
and unusual increases in utility
rates, unemployment com-
pensation, and Social Security
payments.

“To make up for this, the
president and the two vice
presidents are going to have to
analyze everything we do here
to see whether it’s absolutely
necessary,’ Cornell predicted.

“This may mean major
surgery, cutting out activities
and even academic programs,”
he explained. *‘Every school |
know of has had to face up to
this, and now Davidson has to.”

Concerning the 7rustee’'s
decision to freeze the tuition
and fees rate, Cornell said,
“They're afraid we'll price our-

selves out of the market.

“We know that all private
schools are beginning to suffer
as the economy gets tighter,
and people wonder if they
should pay extra to go to a
school like Davidson,"’ he added.

‘I say they will as long as the
product we have to offer is
quality education.” he con-
tinued.

The meeting of the frustees
last Friday was a special one
called primarily for the purpose
of outlining the budget.

‘I hope we continue it,’’ Cor-
nell said. ‘It's the logical way
to build a budget, because
everybody has a chance to be
heard, all the priorities are
clarified

‘‘We were able to put together
as intelligent a budget as any
I've seen in a long time,”’ he
commented.

Though the session centered
on the budget, ‘‘There was a lot
of consideration of on-going
programs,” noted Hall.

“There was discussion of the
necessity of completing the
building we're engaged in--the
library, new dormitories,’ he
explained.

Faculty Upset By Deterioration
Of Salaries, Compensations

By BOB HOWELL
Managing Editor

The faculty has passed a
resolution requesting the
college Administration to ‘‘ex-
plain its position regarding
Faculty salaries and other com-
pensation.”

Submitted by the faculty’s
Professional Affairs Committee
in a meeting of the faculty this
week, the resolution also
requests a report on projected
budget priorities for the next
five years.

“We are alarmed about the
relative deterioration of
Faculty compensation and wish
to hereby register our con-
cern,’’ reads the resolution.

The statement pointed out
that from 1966 to 1972 the total
income of the college increased
by 67 percent, but the total
faculty compensation increased
only 48 percent and total in-
struction expenditures only 56
percent.

It continued that in the 1966-67
school year the college's in-
come from tuition was ap-
proximately seven percent less

College Presient Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. recently an-
nounced that the college
would contribute funds equal
to half that previously

received from the subsidized
Board of Visitors’ DAVID-
SONIAN subscriptions to be
used in next vear's budget.

He indicated that this was
being done to prevent budget
cuts in next vear'’s paper
which might have been nec-
cessary because of the loss
of subscription money. After
next vear the college will not
make this contribution.

than faculty compensation,
while in the 1972-73 school year
tuition is approximately 37.5
percent greater than faculty
compensation.

“During the period 1972-73,
the average salary received by
the Davidson Faculty, after ad-
justing for increases in the cost
of living, is only 98.8 percent of
the average salary paid six
years earlier,”’ the resolution
reads.

The document recognizes the
fact that the average salary of
currently employed faculty
members who were also em-
ployed in 1966, after adjusting
for inflation, had increased ap-
proximately six percent by
1971.

But it emphasizes that ‘‘the
Faculty has not shared in the
general prosperity of the
college and the nation.”

This statement is based on the
fact that during the period 1966-
72 average per capita income,

after adjusting for inflation, in--
creased approximately 20 per-
cent.

In addition to passing the
resolution the faculty heard a
report by College President
Samuel R. Spencer on last
week's meeting of the Board of
Trustees.

Spencer outlined the budget
approved by the board (see this
week's DAVIDSONIAN story on
the budget, above) explaining
that the largest increases are in
salaries and wages, the new
library, instruction and re-
‘search and maintenance

The trustees voted $198,000 in
wage and salary increases, said
Spencer, the majority of which
will go to wage employees at the
lower end of the economic
scale.

The faculty was also told that
the Finance Committee of the
board had agreed to retain a
land use developing firm, Lewis
Clark and Associates of
Raleigh, to provide preliminary
sketches for a possible new
housing development for
faculty and staff.

The proposed site for the
project is the McConnell
property to the north of Concord
Road, and the firm is to suggest
possible layouts and estimates
as to the project's costs.

Committees reported to the
board on the progress of these
and other areas, such as student
medical service, the Queens-
Davidson campaign, and cam-
pus governance.

Additionally, a committee
was appointed to look into the
campus radio station, WDAV,
and its application for an FM
license.

The question of faculty
tenure--whether or not one of its
prerequisites should be active
membership in a _ Christian

church--was the subject for an

afternoon session of the board's
subcommittee on the subject
and the Faculty Executive
Committee.

‘‘People were heard who were
in favor of changing the
requirement, and some who
were against changing it,”’ said
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr.

“There will probably be
another meeting this month,”
he continued, ‘‘and I would hope
that at that time they would
arrive at some position that
could be presented to the
faculty and the board.”’

Open House: An Institution

(Ed. Note: This is the first in
a two-part series on faculty-
student relations. It focuses on
things as they were in the past.
Next week's article will deal
with the future of student-
faculty relations.)

By BRUCE CORSER
Asst. Managing Editor
Prior to 1967 a regular
program of faculty open houses
was one of the institutions of
Davidson College.
This was the era that Sunday
night Vesper services from 7:30
to 8:30 were required, so con-

sequently, open houses im-
mediately followed.
Usually, one-fourth of the

faculty held open house each
week. A list of open houses was
even a regular feature in THE
DAVIDSONIAN and professors
often announced open houses to
students in their classes.

Associate Director of Alumni
Relations and former Davidson
student Zack Long recalled that
Sunday visitations used to be
“the thing todo.”

He remembered that the

system was “contrived in a
way.” that, although student
attendance was not required,
visitations were “expected.”
“One almost had to go see cer-
tain faculty members,’ he
noted.

Long said the program itself
was regarded as ‘something
special’’ and that open houses
were a “fine way to get to know
the faculty better?”

He further pointed out that
“some students used the op-
portunity to brown-nose, but I
think the majority had real
social and personal interests.”

“Sunday night was a good
time enjoyed by all, Long
declared. *‘Most of the faculty
made the students comfortable
and welcome in their homes.”

“This was a good opportunity
to talk about things that
sometimes one didn't have a
chance to discuss in class. A lot
of faculty-student relationships
were made more personal that
way.” he said.

The program “transcended
class lines and was an old
fashioned way to meet different

people,"’ asserted Long.

Professor of Psychology and
Davidson student from 1960 to
1964 Russell Walls said he had
‘positive feelings’ about open
houses.

Commenting that he wished
he'd taken advantage of the
program even more than he
had, Walls stated that the
facylty -open houses allowed
him the chance to ‘get a better
perspective of the professors’
personalities and avocations.”

He noted that being able to
see the professors within the
“contest of their families”
made him aware that faculty
members were ‘‘regular
people.”

Registrar Richard C. Burts
Jr. said that *‘student attitudes
have changed in regard to open
house. Toward the end of the
program they didn't respond.”

“The removal of the Vespers
was a major cause of this. A
good many students were here
and it only took a little bit more
effort to go to open house.
Besides, there was not much
