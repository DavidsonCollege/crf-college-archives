Netters split four matches,
extend teamrecord to 4-2-1

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Davidson’s Men’s Tennis
Team extended their record to
4-2-1 by recording two victor-
ies and two losses during the
week.

In a match played yester-
day, Davidson lost 7-2 toa
powerful Atlantic Coast Con-
ference squad from Duke. Tom
Shelly was the only Davidson
singles player to pull an upset
as he beat the Blue Devils’
Bobby Bitter in three sets.

Shelly got off to a slow start
by losing the first set 1-6 but
then rallied for 7-6 and 6-3
victories in the second and
third sets respectively.

The only other Davidson
victory came on a forfeit by
Duke in the number three
doubles match.

Davidson Coach Jeff Frank
felt that, despite the one-sided
score the loss’ was a ‘‘good
loss’.

‘Last year we played vir-
tually the same Duke team
with a more experienced squad
and they beat us 9-0. This year
we played more younger play-
ers and only lost 7-2 so ina
sense it was a good loss.”’

Frank also feels that play-
ing such a powerful squad
early in the season will help his
young Wildcats gain matur-
ity.

‘Right now we have five
sophomores and four fresh-
men, all of whom are seeing at
least some action. And al-
though they may not be able
to beat these stronger players
they will get a chance to gain
experience and learn how to
think on the court against the
better tennis players.”

Earlier in the week, David-
son got one of its few brea-
thers against a decimated
Rochester squad.

Due to injury and illness the
Northern visitors were only
able to field four players and
were blown out by the Wild-

cats 6-0.

Junior Steve Holman and
Junior John Mitchell crushed
their opponents by the iden-
tical scores of 6-1, 6-0. Frank
was extremely pleased with
play of Steve Johnson and Gil
Kayton in the number one
doubles match and John Trout
and Shelly in the number two
doubles match.

Kayton, Trout, Shelly and
Andy White are the four fresh-
men on the team and Frank
feels they are progressing well.

‘Gill and Andy are really
helping us in the doubles and
John is just now making up
for the work he missed in the
fall when he had mono and will
be. stronger as the season
progresses.”’

Davidson played.-its first
conference opponent Friday
and came away with a rain
shortened 4-1 victory over
William and Mary.

Davidson won the numbers
three, four, five, and six
matches handily with only
Chip Bondurant losing in the
number one match.

“Chip played under his cap-
ability but he will not face an
easy opponent all year in the
number one match,” explained
Frank

“He and Mike Barnhill in °

the number two seed will
consistently be playing the
other teams’ strongest players
and unlike the third through
sixth seeds they never get a
break, especially since we play
so many scholarship teams.”’
Davidson lost their first
match of the season to Swar-
thmore 7%-1%. Holman
picked up the only Davidson
victory 7-6, 6-4 and a doubles
match had to be called off due
to darkness accounting for
Davidson’s other 2 point.
Davidson has now played
seven home matches in less
than two weeks.,Frank feels
that so many matches in a
short period of time will have

Aine gpecting in

its advantages and disadvan-
tages.

“When something goes off
in a kid’s game in this situa-
tion he may not have time to
work on correcting the prob-
lem but by the time we get
into the conference schedule
we will have a great deal of
experience.”’

‘“‘When they’ve played
teams like Swarthmore, Duke,
and North Carolina they won’t
be intimidated by teams like
Furman and Appalachian.”

Frank feels that his squads
along with Furman, Appala-
chian, and the Citadel will be
strongest in conference comp-
etition. Davidson will have the
benefit of about 15 matches
experience before facing
Southern Conference foes and
Frank feels they will be ready.

Coach Pat Drake viewed the
defeats optimistically. ‘‘I feel
that this past week was one of
the toughest that our girls are
going to face,’’ she said.

‘‘The scores were remark-
ably close considermg that the
other two teams had been
practicing months.in advance.
For instance, the Clemson
girls had been weight training
since the end of August.”

Despite Davidson’s compar-
ably late entry into the colle-
giate tennis season, their
match play reflects the depth»
of this year’s Girls’ Varsity
Tennis Team.

In the Clemson singles mat-
ches, third seeded Becca Stim-
son and fourth seeded Sue
McAvoy recorded victories.
The second seeded doubles
team of Sue McAvoy and
Dea Booth and the third seed-
ed team of Nancy Brown and
Andrea Murphy both won res-
pectively.

In reviewing the loss at
Clemson, team captain Dea
Booth said, ‘‘Even though I
forgot my glasses, the remain-
der of the team kept a sharp
eye on their opponents. We
can only improve as the season

”

goes on.

Thursday’s home match ag-
ainst Furman proved to be
another disappointing loss for
the team.

Stimson and McAvoy
showed consistency by win-
ning their-Singles matches,
while sixth seeded Ruth Mur-
phy also recorded a win.

The second seeded team of
McAvoy and Booth captured
the only doubles victory of the
day. Davidson’s number one
doubles, Stimson and Kirk
Cameron showed the potential
to become a first-rate working
doubles team during the sea-
son.

This week the team will
meet Converse in an away
match, and Monday they tra-
vel to Queens College for a
make-up match.
