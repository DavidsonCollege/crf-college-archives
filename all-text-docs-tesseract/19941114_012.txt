THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS St LIVING MONDAY, NOVEMBER 14,

Refugee conveys powerful
story through performance art

By Geordie Schimmel

On November 8, in what was
perhaps one of the most unique
performances this semester in the
900 Room, Burmese refugee
Yuzana Khin performed her origi-
nal play, “A Struggle for Free-
dom.”

The one-person play is dedi-
cated to.the human rights struggle
of Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi and incorporates slides,
music, and singing. During the pro-
duction, Khin moves between per-
sonas, speaking as herself, as the

‘oppressive Burmese military
forces, or as Suu Kyi. All of this

occurred as slide images are flashed

onto a screen behind the actress.

Khin’s theatrical techniques
are powerful. The audience, in-
stead of sitting dumbly before a
flat, uninspired stage, is elevated
to aheightened state. Burma comes
alive beneath Khin’s acting, and
through her, Burma’s plight is made
real and tangible.

Khin has gained something of
a reputation internationally. In
1988 she led the pro-democracy
movement in Burma, amassing
10,000 students in a nonviolent
demonstration to protest the injus-
tice of the currently-installed junta.

Eventually Khin applied for
and received amnesty from the
United States, where she went on
to receive various degrees from
Simon’s Rock College and
Georgetown University. Presently
she is performing in the United
States, speaking about the human
rights situation in Burma and per-
forming her multimedia play: “We
will prevail,” Khin says. “We must
all work together.” And because
of the efforts of the Davidson chap-

ter of Amnesty International, and ~

because of the international im-
pact of her touching play, Yuzana
Khin may be right.

Music Review

New release, Nirvana Unplugged,
fuels legend of Kurt Cobain

By Tom Bavis

Recordeda year ago this week,
MTV Unplugged in New York gives
the Nirvana myth an added dose of
bittersweetness. Kurt Cobain’s
voice, frail and detached, wails
melodies that can arouse emotions
as well as leave people humming
for hours.

“Polly” and “Something in the
Way” appear almost unchanged
from the originals. Most of the
songs on Unplugged have much
the same the feel of those two
Nevermind ballads: the guitars
sound less like acoustic instruments
and more like unplugged electric
ones. All the instruments, espe-
cially the drums, are understated.
Thus, Kurt Cobain’s voice, for
better or worse, gets pushed to the
forefront.

A trembling cello heightens
the tension in “Dumb,” helping to
make it one of the very best origi-
nals of the show. Cobain’s deci-
sion to go it alone on “Pennyroyal
Tea” pays off. A seemingly mean-
ingless song from Jn Utero, when
stripped to the minimum, proves to
possess moments of quiet inten-
sity: “Give me a Leonard Cohen
afterworld / So I can sigh eter-
nally.”

One of the band’s most honor-

able qualities on Unplugged is
their unpredictable yet satisfying
choice of songs, both for covers
andoriginals. Justas “Teen Spirit,”
“Lithium,” and “Heart-Shaped
Box” are conspicuously missing,
so is anything by Cobain favorites
R.E.M. and the Beatles.’ Three
Meat Puppets covers feature guest
appearances by members of that
Arizona band. Nirvana bassist
Krist Novoselic impresses with a
switch to accordion for the album’s
best cover, “Jesus Doesn’t Want
Me fora Sunbeam.” Cobain intro-
duces the Leadbelly classic “‘Where
Did You Sleep Last Night” with
the surprising assertion, “This is a
song by my favorite performer —
our favorite performer, actually.”

With such great songs to work
with, it is easy not to notice some
of the technical weaknesses that
make Nirvana’s Unplugged album

inferior compared to the infallible
ones of 10,000 Maniacs and Eric
Clapton. But some imperfections
reveal themselves on a careful lis-
ten. Dave Grohl, usually as pow-
erful a drummer as they come,
drifts too far to the extreme of

near-silence. Because of this, he

needlessly becomes a follower.

Despite the way they look from
pictures of the show, the guitars
sound far from acoustic. Except
for a couple of songs in which they
are given some distortion, they
possess a bland sound of an elec-
tric guitar with nothing on it. It is
pure, perhaps, but not ear-catch-
ing.

However, even with the
wimpy drums, the strained voice,
and the murky guitars, Unplugged
still earns its pay on the power of
great songs, Nirvana-written or
otherwise.

Dear Terry Buffington,

Dear Terry,

Dr. Ruth came this week, but
she didn’t answer all of my ques-
tions. she said to keep lyst alive
you have to try new things. But, I
want to know the what, where,
and how of these “‘new things.”

. Sincerely,
Horny and Hoping

Dear Horny and Hoping,

There is a reason Dr. Ruth
did not recite a detailed list of new
and exciting things to help revive
the lust in your relationship. You
need to use your own imagina-
tion. No one knows the sexual
fantasies lurking in the recesses
of your mind better than you.
These “new things” you plan to
try need to be tailored to your
desires.

Dr. Terry, however, will not
leave totally abandoned. As a
starting point] will listsome items
and ideas that I have found help-
ful. You are on your own to figure
out how to incorporate my sug-
gestions into your bedroom activ-
ity. Here are some “new things”
you might find interesting:
packing bubbles, crisco, sour
cream, whip cream, asnake, flash-
lights, batting helments, clippings
of my photos from past issues,
Barry White, a javeline or two, a

tubix cube, a tube of super glue,
and leg warmers.

love,

Terry

Dear Terry,
How do you deal with some-
one who’sasnob but doesn’tknow
what she’s talking about? I mean,
if you’ re going to talk about qual-
ity all the time you should at least
know what it is, shouldn’t you?

Sincerely,
Confused

Dear Confused,

I know the kind of person
you are dealing with. This per-
sonality type has passed through
my office more than once, and I
can assure you they are some of
the most difficult people with
which I work.

luckily Ihave come up witha
solution for how to handle socio-
logical assaholic, as they are
known in the biz. Next time they
say something that you disagree
with, kill them. Very few dead
people are snobs. We don’t need
these slimes anyway.

Love,
Terry
