Battalion Soon to
Shine In New Uniforms

Will Probably Be Issued this Week.

Several large boxes of uniforms have
at last arrived. The question is being
asked, “When will the uniforms be is-
sued >" Colonel Mueller says: ‘The
uniforms will be issued as soon as there
are essential parts enough for every
man.”

The uniforms, overcoats and shoes are
being shipped from the various army
posts, some from as far as Chicago. It
is not known just what parts of the uni-
forms are here, but everything is being
checked up. In the meantime ship-
ments are arriving daily and Colonel
Mueller assures us that we will cer-
tainly be issued uniforms by the last of
the week.

‘There has been a delay in the ship-
ment of rifles due to the confusion in
the ordnance department. With thou-
sands of soldiers discharged every day.
it seems that it would be an casy mat-
ter to send two hundred and fifty rifles.
We must take into consideration, how-
ever, the enormous amount of work on
the War Department at this time and
rest assured that the rifles will soon he
here.
