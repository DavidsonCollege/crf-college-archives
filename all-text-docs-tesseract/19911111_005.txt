Let’s Learn Some
Manners, People!

Recently in the Davidsonian,a
number of controversy-sparking
articles have been published. I
have been appalled for the most
part at the manner in which several
Davidsonstudents haveresponded
to opinions they disagreed with . I
have heard of two instances in
which two different Davidsonian
writers were harassed and threat-
ened over the telephone. And who

need to realize that our speech is
protected by constitutional law. To
threaten someone verbally because
of whatthat person has said in print
is a violation of that person’s civil
rights, Notonly is harassing some-
one in the middle of the nighttacky,
it’s criminal.

Finally I’d like to address a
concern that has been voiced time
and time again in the Davidsonian.

Stop Waving the F.L.A.G.

By Jim Carswell

Let me start this piece with a
confession: my name is not on the
FLAG petition, and I donot wantit
there. Now, don’t jump to conclu-
sions -- I’m not a homophobe or
Christian fundamentalist.

Actually, Ido, in principle, sup-
port the idea of aFLAG chapter on
the Davidson campus. We are a
small, conservative, and often stag-
nant school that needs to be awak-
ened to the realities of human sexu-
ality.

There are gays and lesbians i in
our midst, and they are entitled to
the same rights and privileges as
any straight White Anglo-Saxon
Protestant. Discriminating against
them denies their them human in-
tegrity and calls into question the
very intelligence of the discrimi-
nator. That said, let me proceed.

FLAG, asI understand it, seeks

to improve the quality of life of
gays and lesbians while also pro-
moting understanding among those
members of the community who
may, in their ignorance, discrimi-
nate against them.

Already, FLAG has begun to
succeed in its first task; as it now
seems that homosexuals can
breathe easier knowing that there
is a measure of support for them.

From my perspective, though, it:
seems that its awareness-raising

attempts, i.e. circulating and pub-
lishing that petition, have failed
miserably.

To explain, I must engage in
some narrative. By now, most of
the people on this campus know
about the petition, buta few weeks
ago, when it was being circulated,
alot of us missed it. I,in fact, only
happened to mun into someone who

hada copy (andI promptly signed —

it), but what about all the people
living off-campus, or those who
just happened to be out when the
crusade came to their door?
Because FLAG neglected to
handle the project in a more thor-
ough manner, a lot of people who
would have signed were left off.

The editorial board of the
Davidsonian, while offering its full
support to the organization, recog-
nized a potential danger in printing
the petition. The concern was that
people who had not been given the
opportunity to sign would be open
to unfounded criticism and scorn
