WILL HAVE VETERAN FIVE

King, McQueen Only Regulars to
Return to Backfield

At the close of what may be called a fair-
ly successful season, the eyes of the campus
are naturally turned towards the prospects
for another Wildcat machine. This year’s
squad was unusual in its greater wealth of
reserve power than former Davidson teams.

Next year prospegts are that the Wildcats |

will have an equal.eleven to this year’s, but

greatly inferior to it from the “Standpoint |
of reserves. The line will remain practically |

as strong as this year’s except at the guard
positions, while the backfield will be great-
ly tampered with by graduation.

Covington, alternate captain and a tower
of strength in the line at the tackle posi-
tion, will be greatly missed next year. Brock
and Parker at guards will be the hardest
to replace of, the whole line, while Proctor,
who has played a fine game at end all year,
will be missed, atlhough he has capable subs
stepping into his shoes, and Mason’s great
work at center will be missed. Three great
gaps will be impossible to replace in the
backfield. Fraley, captain and quarterback ;
McCall, ball-toter deluxe and mentioned for
All-Atierican, and Tom Brohard, steady
driving fullback, will form a triumvirate
that will be most keenly, missed.

In spite of these important vacancies, vir-
tually every position next year will have
at least one good candidate and a few have
two or three. On the flanks, there will be
Steve Brown, one of the most consistently
good ends in the state, on one end, with
“Skinny” Pierce, Bob Johnson and Mart
Miller’ available for the other end. The
will send up O'Keefe, a light

but sc
some promise, and Pratt, another light man.
Out of these last three, one will probably
see quite a lot of service as a reserve. The
flank division will probably. be even strong-
er next year than it was this year, with
Brown playing his last year, Pierce, with
a year of much experience behind him, and
Miller, who is a good all-around end.

Wildcats Gain Many
Yards Through Line

Only Three of Davidson’s Oppo-
nents Outgained Wildcats

The Davidson Wildcats gained nearly
2,000 yards through the line of their various
opponents this fall, figures recently com-
piled show. Line plays netted 1,828 yards in
the ten games for an average of 182.8 yards
per game. This same line held enemy ad-
vances down to 1,240 yards for the season,
an average of 58 yards per game less than
the gains of Davidson.

The comparatively light forwards of Da-
vidson were outweighed in nearly every game,
but were nevertheless able to consistently
open holes for the backs. Coach Monk
Younger’s style of play calls for straight off-
tackle plays and end runs where the respon-
sibility rests upon the line men to open up
the way.

Davidson outgained all but three teams.

Duke, The Citadel, and V. M. I. were the|

, only opponents gaining more yardage than’

Davidson. Only one team held Davidson to
less than 125 yards gain per game, the Blue
Devils stopping the Wildcats with only 42
yards,

The best single afternoon’s work for Da-
vidson backs was registered against Elon,
when 333 yards were gained. The Univer-
sity of North Carolina Tar Heels gave up
230 yards, and Erskine was opened up for
241 yards.

Duke was the only team to gain. more
than 200 yards through the Wildcat line,

’ their total being 238 yards. Only two other

teams, The Citadel and V. M. I., showed
gains of more than 150 yards by scrimmage,
and three teams were held to less than 50
yards gain per game. Davidson’s schedule
this year was unusually hard, carrying five
Southern Conference foes.

ppy player; Morris, -who~shows

predicted that to win the state
championship, Carolina would have
to beat Davidson. Truer predictions
were never uttered, for had. the Tar
Heels been victor:ous over the Wild-
cats, Carolina would have ended the
season with three victories and a
tie, compared to Duke’s two wins
and two knotted counts. However, it
is not contended that Coach Collins
had any idea of the muddled status
of affairs that was to develop to-
ward the close of the season.

“If we get it right,” editorially
commented the Greensboro Daily
News of Monday morning, “Duke
got the state championship but it
came by way of Davidson.”

Davidson Coaches Pick
All-State Combinations

Younger and Tilson Each Select
One Davidson Man for Their
Mythical Elevens

Davidson Coaches Younger and Tilson
placed one Davidson man each on_ their
mythical All-State elevens. Thad Brock,

who played end last year and guard the
year just passed, was chosen to fill the end
position by Coach Younger, while Tilson
|picked Steve Brown to fill that position.
| No Wildcat backfield’men were selected by
jeither of the two mentors.

Coaches Younger and Tilson agreed on
the linemen from tackle to tackle, but dis-
agreed on the men to fill the end positions
and two backfield posts. ' Younger placed
Brock of Davidson and Rosky of Duke at
the flanks as opposed by Tilson’s combina-
tion of Hyatt of Duke and Brown of Da-
vidson. Fullback and one of the halfback
posts were occupied by different selections.
Younger used Mills of Wake Forest at full,
but Tilson chose Brewer, the Duke flash,
to fill that position. For one of the half-
backs Younger selected Magner of Caro-
lina and Tilson, Nash of the same institu-
tion. The two coaches agreed on Murray
of Duke and Branch of Carolina for half-
back and quarterback, respectively. “We
could pick about four teams, composed of
entirely different players, and each would
be just about as good as the other,”
marked Younger in making his picks.

The pivot position said by
coaches to be the hardest to fill, but both
believe that, Parker of Wake Forest is just
about the best man for the post. Younger
said: “The hardest choice I had to make
was between Gardner of my team and Park-
er of Wake Forest, but I> finally chose
Parker because he is a little more experi-
enced man.”

Coach Younger favored three men each
from Duke, Carolina, and Wake Forest, and
one each from Davidson and State. Tilson
gave Duke four places, Carolina three, Wake
Forest two, and one each to Davidson and
State.

By downing the Juniors in the play-off |
game last week, the Sophomores won a clear |
claim to the 1930 basketball

ball, made the best of every opportunity to |

But before running the curtain down
on the grid year, it would be well to
mention this past seagon’s schedule
and take this means of thanking the
men responsible for it. Seven of Dav-
idson’s games were played either on
Richardson Field or in Charlotte, giv-
ing, in effect, seven home games. Two
others were played at Greensboro and
Durham, close enough for nearly all
of the student body to see each one.
Only one contest was so far away as
to be completely out of reach for the
majority of the students. It was as
nearly a perfect card for spectators as

could be asked.

It was almost as well arranged for the
team, too. As it turned out, they did not
have to play a really hard game until well
into October. Most of the time there was
ample time between the important tilts to
prepare for thém as they came.

Captain Pritchett’s job of arranging the
schedule is no easy one and has done a
fine job on this one. From what can be
learned about the 1931 schedule, it will be
ag good as the one just finished, and will

carry bigger teams,

95 First Downs Are

Scored During Year

The Davidson Wildeats made an average
of more than nine first downs a game dur
ing the past foothall season, running up 95

firsts and ten during their hard ten-game

schedule. Examination of the records shows
that this is an even two dozen more than
their opponents made, the Wildcats yielding

lonly 71 throughout the season.

The Davidson offense clicked best against
the Erskine Seceders, and ran up 15 first
downs. Davidson totalled 12 against V. P. I.,
and 11 each against Carolina, Wofford, and
Elon. The smallest number made in any
one game was four against N. C. State.
Duke turned the Wildcats back with five.

Citadel made nine each. The Wildcats’ best
defensive work was shown against N. C.
State, who were able to make only two first
downs.

The

scored, but several of the most important
Davidson scores of last fall are listed un-
der the various headings.
Five touchdowns scored by Joe Mc-
Call are in the list, he leading all
Davidson players in number mention-
ed. His 85 yard kickoff return against
Clemson, receives notice, as does his
interception and 65 yard run for a
score in the N. C. State game. His 45
yard run against Duke is the longest
Davidson run from scrimmage. The
other two scores of his in the lists
are the 15 yard pass from Brock and
resulting 55 yard run against V. M. I.
and his 20 yard run from scrimmage
in the Elon game.

The other two touchdowns are Red
Parrish’s 40 yard dash for a score against
Carolina, and Fraley’s one yard drive for
a score against N. C. State.

Thad Brock’s 102 yard run against
Dttke is not mentioned at all, due to
the fact that it did not result in a
score. Had he gone the other five
yards separating him from a touch-
down, his run, which would have been
of 107 yards, wou'd have been the
longest scoring run of the year, the
longest scoring play from scrimmage,
and the sixth longest run in the his-
tory of football which is on the record
book.

Seven touchdowns made against Dav-
idson, last year, are mentioned also. Two
touchdowns, from
McMillan to Woodruff, are among them.
(thers to receive notice are passes from

of Clemson's passes

Branch to-Ward for a Carolina score; and
from Willéims to Waggoner of Elon for
the Christian’s marker. Two plays, Ward's
65 yard run and Mills of Wake Forest's

in the book against Davidson.
