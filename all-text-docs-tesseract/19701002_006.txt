By HAL CANTER
Sports Writer

Head football coach Dave
Fagg called Saturday's 14-5
victory over the University
f.. Richmond “a magnifi-
cent triumph” and added
that the entire staff and all
players. had (ade a great
effort, ,

“We have, the greatest
confidence’ in our. men,”
said Fagg. ‘‘The 1970 team
has .an unique and different:
pride in their..team and
school.

“Tt is proof of the strength
in the football program that
such a team could be pro-
duced after losing a head
coach and many outstanding
players last year.”

Asked if Davidson had a .

psychological “edge over
Richmond, Fagg said that
jast year was the first time
in five years that Davidson
had defeated the Spiders.
“That’s ‘not much of an
edge,’’ he concluded.

The Wildcats scored the
first time they got their
hands on- the ball. Mike
Mikolayunas topped -the 64
yard .scoring. drive as he
raced 21 yards down the left
side: with a Mark Thompson
pass. Key runs by Johnny
Ribet and Bill Bracken sus-
tained the scoring drive.

Richmond began threaten-
ing late in the ofirst quarter
and marched to the Wild-
cat's six to~seeJim Live-
say..drop;.a touchdown. pass.
The Spiders’ kicked a field
goal from there to bring the
score to 7-3.

Early in'the ‘third quarter
Rick Lyon raced 73 yards

with a punt return to the
Spider's seven. Three plays
later Bill Bracken slammed
across the goal from the one
to widen the lead to 14-7.

Later in the quarter Rich-
mond tagged a_ safety. on
the Wildcats when Mark
Thompson was called for in-
tentional grounding from the
endzone.

The Spiders only threaten-
ed once in the fourth quart-
er when they drove to the
Wildcat eight only to see a
field goal attempt fall wide
to the right.

Fagg heaped praise on the
Richmond club as he- term-
ed them among the two, top
teams in the conference ‘now
who should be there at the
end of the season.

The Southern Conference
named senior Rick Lyon
runner-up offensive player
of the week ‘as..a result of

his performance. In addition .

to the long punt return, Lyon
caught three passes for 33
yards.

Senior Ken Totherow was
named the Southern Con-
ference Player of the Week
for, his defensive effort: He;
Jim Buchanan, and Sean
McCormick kept more. pres-
sure on quarterback Charlie
Richards than the passing
whiz had been exposed to so

_far this season.

Richards only manged to
complete 15 of 37. passes for
143 yards. ‘Three of his pass-
es were picked. off by sen-
iots Ghris Giles and Rick
Hawarah and sophomore
James Hardison. Fagg also
cited, sophomore linebacker

~ Mike Sikes for a strong de-

fensive effort.

mance last week in stopping
Richmond's aerial - minded
offense without a touchdown.
It will be faced with another
rugged task this week, try-

ing to stop Trinity's over-

land assault, which is spear-
headed by | senational tail-
