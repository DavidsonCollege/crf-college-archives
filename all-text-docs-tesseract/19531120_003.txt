THE DAVIDSONIAN

CITADE. BULLDOGS HERE FOR

Carolina Distance Event

Slated Here

Tomorrow

Tomorrow morning at’11 a.m., Davidson’s cross country
team will close its season with the Carolina A.A.U. meet on the
local 4-mile course. They will be favored to place second
behind the A.A.C. champions, N. C. State.

Shockley of State, who tied for
first place in the State meet last
week with Sawyer (setting a new
course record) will be favored in
the meet, but will be pushed by
Davidson’s Homer Sparks. Sawyer
of State, one of the nation’s top
runners, is not entered due to the
fact that he is running in the Na-
tional Intercollegiates this week-
end.

Trophies Presented

A team trophy will be presented
to the winning team, and individual
medals will be awarded to the top
fifteen runners.

The other teams represented
along with Davidson and State are
North Carolina freshman, Burling:

Shows Improvement
As Opener Nears

By BUDDY LILES

Coach Danny Miller's Wildcats
have been working long and hard
for their opening game with the
Guilford College Quakers on De-
cember 2. The Wildcats are hosts
to the Quakers in the inter-con-
ference tilt.

The Quakers are one of the most
dangerous teams in the North
State Conference. Although they
aren't always in the top bracket,
Guilford has ‘upset some of the

leading teams in the year’s past.|

Harding, Weeks Alling

The Wildcats are looking for
height and some more reserve
power. The team has rounded into
good shape, stressing speed and
balihandling and with the excep-
tion of Ray Harding and Ed Weeks
will be at their full strength. Bud-
dy Brown is also on the injured
list, but will be ready by the 2nd.

Coach Miller has mixed in some
scrimmage games with North State
Conference teams in the practice
sessions. The Cats looked only fair
in the first game but since then
have shown much improvement
and should be hard to beat by the
opening game.

The starting lineup can not be
determined this early but several
boys have looked sharp in practice
and will probably get into action
against Guilford. Ish, “the swish,”
Bennett and Hobby Cobb loom as
the big scoring threats, at forward,
and guard, respectively. Big George
Melton and Grahme Keith are

Freshman, Lees-McCrae_ College,
Pfieffer College, Duke and Bel-
mont Abbey.

Beaty Tough

North Carolina's freshmen will
bring their top contender, Jimmy
Beaty, to the meet and he is ex-
pected to finish near the top in
the rugged 4mile competition.
Pete Ashcraft, Davidson’s fresh-
man ace, will try for the third time
this season to best the speedy Tar-
hee], having lost twice to Beaty
during the regular season.

Duke's Blue Devils will enter five
men, three varsity and two fresh-
men, and should have several good
contenders for one of the 15

Last Monday et Williamsburg, Va., four cross country runners brought Davidson her highest con-
ference standing in recent years as they copped third place and four trophies. They ave: Floyd Feeney
(14th), Homer Sparks (2nd), Andy Turner (19th), and Dick Lovette (13th).

Cross Country Runners
Claim Four S.C. Trophies

In placing third in the annual Southern Conference cross country meet last Monday,
Coach “Pete” Whittle’s harriers brought four conference trophies back to the local campus.
In leading his teammates to their best showing of the season, Captain Homer Sparks took
second place in the meet. Dick Lovette, Floyd Feeney, and Andy Turner also brought back
trophies for finishing in the top twenty-five in the conference.

Chesterfield
Contest

The foothall game this week
with The Cifadel bring the cur-
rent Chesterfield contest to e
close. However, due to the
great amount of enthusiasm
shown for the contest, another
similar one will probably be
held some time later in the
year. Last week's contest was
without e doubt the closest
and most heavily entered of
the entire year. Any number
of predictions were within e
few points of the actual 33 to
0 score, but again Carl Jeck-
son came the closest with the
score of 32 to 0. Since this is
the lest week of the contest,
entries will be coming in fast
and furious, but remember,
your chances of winning ere
increased every time you pul a
score in the box at the stu-
dent store, and the number
of scores ts unlimited as long

This year’s meet showed a big
improvement over last year's com-
petition. The caliber of wrestling
was much higher, and the pairings
turned out a lot of interesting
matches.

It was the points won by run-
ners-up that gave the Phi Delts
the win. Four Phis came in second
in their weight divisions.

The SAEs came in second with
a total of 27 points. The Phi Gams
(last year’s champion) and the
Betas tied for third. A small team
of independents turned in a sur-
prising performance to place fifth.

In the 123-lb class, Jones (KA)
pinned Hunter (Phi Delt) late in
the second period of the cham-
pionship match. Thornton (Betas)
and Spiers (Pika) placed third and
fourth respectively.

Jordan (Ind.) won the champion-
ship in the 130-Ib class with a de-
cision over Schoenberger (KA).

WILDCAT GRIDDERS
veg, |MUOHLY SPIRITED
*"/FOR LAST CHANCE

By JOHN HANDLEY
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 Da-
vidson’s football Wildcats of 1953

:|take the field for the last time

this season when they meet the
Bulldogs of The Citadel in a con-
ference affair at Richardson Field.
Both teams have yet to take the
measure of a conference opponent
this season and the conference cel-
lar will be decided by the en-
counter.

Although failing to win in the
conference the Bulldogs have man-
aged to take the measure of the
Presbyterian Blue Hose for their
only win this year. Presbyterian,
of course, took the measure of the
Wildcats to the heartbreaking tune
of 19-18 at homecoming.

Celler Struggle

Both teams are struggling in one
of the poorest seasons in recent
years, however, the Cats’ spirit
and morale seemed to nave been -
little effected by the white wash-
ing they have received in their first
8 starts. The Cats have worked
hard this week in preparation for
the encounter and though are in
poor physical shape due to sev-
eral injuries, they are really fired
up to win this last one.

The Cats have shown fine spirit,
hustle, and determination all
through the season though they
have failed to win. Last week in
the George Washington encounter,
even though trailing by over 3
TDs, the Cats showed fine spirit
against the tough Colonials.

Many Injuries

Out of the action for this week's
encounter will be all three of the
leading fullbacks, Leroy Fargason,
Tal Broughton, and Jim Shelton,
who have sustained injuries in re-
cent weeks. Lineman Tom Owen
will also miss the finale because
of an arm injury received in prac-
tice early this week.

Ben Craig and Johnny Gray are,
of course, still out of action and
they wil} be ‘sitting on the side-
lines as three of their classmates

Faison (SAE), This was probably! wno will receive their diplomas

the best match of the evening, with
both boys evenly matched and
showing a knowledge of wrestling
skill. Snyder (Beta) took a win
over Flintom (Phi Gam) for the
third place honors.

In the 167-lb class, Sonny Kin-
cey (SAE) defeated Scott Ball (Phi
Delts) to win the championship.
Whitesell (Phi Gam) defeated Lit-
tle (Beta) in the battle for third
place.

Van Julian and: Richard Hols-
houser met in the finals of the
177-pound class, and Julian (Beta)
decisioned Holshouser (Sigma Chi)
for the championship. Cathey (Kap-
pa Sig) defeated Nelson (Phi Delt)

Graham Aggressive

Graham, one of the toughest
competitors on this year's squad,
has served as the captain of the
team from his guard position since
the injury of Captain Ben Craig.
Neil has been outstanding on both
offense and defense all year and
has been one of the leading tack-
lers for the Cats.
