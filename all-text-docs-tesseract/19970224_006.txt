Court issue balanced abortion rulings

Both sides of the abortion issue
won legal battles last week as the
Supreme Court dealt with issues of
protecting rights to abortion and to
protest.

A 6-3 majority reaffirmed the
power of local courts to protect pa-
tients’ rights to access to the door-
ways and driveways of clinics.

The court also ruled with a 8-1
majority that a New York judge
went too far in trying to limit pro-
testers’ peaceful activities down the
street. The judge was enforcing the
Clinic Access Act that was made
into law in 1993.

The Act limited the activities
of protestors near abortion clinics
to allow future patients more pri-
vacy and ease of entrance to the
clinics.

Chief Justice William
Rehnquist stated in America, like it

or not, there is no “generalized right
to be let alone on a public street or
sidewalk.”

It could make it harder for an
anguished woman who has decided
that she must terminate a dangerous
or unwanted pregnancy and would
prefer to be shielded from protests.

But, the Court decided that the
right to choose an abortion did not
violate the free speech rights of
others.
Anti-abortion activists did not
get exactly what they desired either
since their “sidewalk counselors”
can still not have unlimited access
to clinic doors.

The judges said that if such
protestors were asked to desist, they
must. The Court was trying to allow
local judges an opportunity to use
their discretion to carefully impose
the balanced protection for abor-

tion rights that does not destroy the
basic right to protest.

Pro-life groups are still not
happy with the required 15 feet
buffer zones since they fear they
will still not be able to warn abor-
tion seekers about the possible dan-
gers associated with having an abor-
tion or to offer them alternatives.

Pro-choice groups were rela-
tively happy with the decisions but
fear that such a close buffer zone
might still allow more extreme acts
of abortion protests like shootings
or illegal harassment.

The mixed reactions on both
sides probably indicate that the
Court found the legal room and
precedents for the interests of both
sides of the issue.

Clinton bans “gag rule” for Medicaid patients

The President used executive
powers to ban Medicaid providers
from concealing possible treatments
to patients that are insured under
the program which covers the poor
and disabled.

In December, the President
announced that the controversial
Health Maintenance Organization
(H.M.O.) practice could not apply
to Medicare patients in such pro-
grams either.

The President also encouraged
Congress to pass a similar law that
would mandate that all H.M.O.’s
could not have “gag rules.”

are insured under H.M.O. programs.

Most of these recipients are blue-
collar workers.

Many critics of H.M.O.’s state
that patients are systematically de-
nied access to hearing all their op-
tions due to the high cost of some
treatments.

Some doctors fear that the rule
is phasing out a key aspect of their
job since they can no longer tell
patients frankly what all their op-
tions are. :

H.M.O organizations have said
they would try to eliminate the rule
themselves, but Iowa representa-
tive, Republican Greg Ganske,
states those mean nothing since they
“have no enforcement mechanism.”

Insurance providers insist that
laws will not help make positive
changes. They insist customer sat-
isfaction with the programs are high
and that changes should be initiated
from that level.

They also claim the law will
raise the cost of insurance premi-
ums.

Many view the President’s
statements and the bipartisan inter-
est in the ban as part of new govern-
ment efforts to seek a more active
role in determining health care

Promise seen in marijuana ,

An expert panel of the National Institutes of Health said marijuana
showed promise for fighting symptoms of some medical conditions
and recommended further study. The head of the panel said it would
have recommendations on possible marijuana studies within the next
month. The Clinton administration has questioned the medical basis
for marijuana and insists it should not be allowed liberally in those
means.
