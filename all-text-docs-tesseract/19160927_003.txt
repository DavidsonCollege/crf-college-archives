WEEKLY MEETINGS

The Literary Societies held their first
regular debate Saturday night. The
question for discussion was: “Resolved.
That the United States should purchase
the Danish West Indies.”

In the Eumenean the affirmative was
upheld by G. C. Bellingrath, R. W.
Cousar and Craig, and the negative by
L. A. Chambliss, W .C. Freeman and
J. K. Hobson.

In the Philanthropic, Berryhill, G. F.
Webber and J. W. Bullock argued for
the affirmative side of the question, and
S. W. Robinson, D. W. Chalmers and
T. A. Racy spoke for the negative.

The affirmative side contended that
these islands should be purchased princi-
pally on account of their value as a
naval base and coaling and supply sta-
tion.. They argued also that we were
compelled to buy in order to carry out
the Monroe Doctrine and keep another
nation from buying them.

The negative contended that from an
economic standpoint the United States
should not purchase these islands as
their actual industrial value is decreas-
ing. They argued, also that on account
of the racial situation on these islands
the United States could not afford to
own them. The point was also brought
out that should the United States pur-
chase them she could not take the lead-
ing which she should take in the present
world peace movement.

In the regular meeting of the Fu-
menean Society, Monday morning, P
B. Price gave an oration on the secret
of the popularity of James Whitcombe
Riley’s poetry—it being to his power to
.touch the hearts of others by his svmpa-
thetic nature. D. M. Orgain spoke on
“What We Owe Mexico,” and I. B.
Woods discussed the recent railway
strike. Those giving declamations were,
Bland, “The Evacuation of the In-
dians;” E. A. Woods, a selection from
“The Tale of Two Cities.” and Cun-
ningham.

The Philanthropic Society had a very
interesting and instructive program
Menday morning. The Freshmen who
took part were: D. W. Roberts.
whose subject was “Patriotism ;” A. L.
Foscue, who gave a declamation on
“The American Merchant © Marine.”
The other declamations were: C. W.
Worth, “Fredericksburg,” and Flem-
ing, “The Passing of the Indian.” The
orations were delivered by W. C. Cum-
ming. who spoke on society work with
especial reference to the new men; T.
M. Misenheimer delivered a good phil-
osophical talk on “Why.” J. W. Bul-

“GENTLEMEN TAKE
OFF THEIR HATS”

About thirty years ago a young girl
in a Western city was given charge of
a Sabbath school class of boys, usually
knowntas the “river rats.” When she
entered the room she found them loung-
ing on the desks and benches, wearing
their -hats, and a defiant leer on every
face.

They greeted her with a laugh, and
one of them exclaimed:

“Well, sis, you going to teach us?”

She stood silent until the laugh was
over, and then said quietly: “Do |
look like a lady ?”

An astonished stare was the only re-
ply which they gave.

“Because,” she continued — gently,
“gentlepnen, when a lady ‘enters the
room, take off their hats.”

The lowest American secretly believes
himself to be a gentleman, and in a
moment every hat was off, and the lads
were ranged in orderly attention.

So remarkable was the success of this
girl in managing and influencing men
of the roughest sort that she made it the
work of her life. She established clean
and respectable boarding houses for sail-
ors and boatmen, and reading and coffee
rooms for laborers, and founded an Or-
der af Honor, the members of which
strove to live sober, Christian lives them-
selves and to help their fellows to do
the same.

Some of the members of her first class
were efficient helpers for twenty years
in all her work. Tt was a favorite say-
ing with them: “Once let Miss Smith
eet hold of a man, and she never lets
him go.”

She never did let go, but followed
him to sea, to the most distant parts of
the world, or even to prison, with let-
ters and little gifts. With all the tend-
er pity of a mother she strove as many
a mother does not strive to bring the
wanderer back to the faith and inno-
cence of his childhood.

Thousands of men passed under this
single woman's influence and learned
something of her Master through her
wonderful purity and strong faith in
Him.— Ex.

A CLUB FOR THE OLD.

Of forming many clubs there is no
end, and one of the latest is unique. A
women’s club which admits no members
under 60 has been started in New York
City, and already has 130 members.
Among them are musicians, artists, in-
ventors, industrial craftswomen, cooks
and housekeepers. The club aims to find
ways and means. for giving old people
new interest in life and add to their hap-
piness in every possible way; to find op-
portunities for them in the outside world
for usefulness and for the application of
such natural talent, ability and experi-
ence as they may possess. ‘Old people
who may not be capable of contributing
anvthing at all to the movement may be
made happy by association and __ social
gatherings, so that there need be no
more ‘lonely’ old people,” says Mrs. C.
A. Rugg, the founder. “And those who
are entirely friendless and homeless will
be enabled to find a place to call their
own, where shelter and food may be
provided at small cost. They will be
made independent, too, by having means
to pay for it put into their own hands,
earned through their own efforts.” The
idea seems to be an admirable one. A
lonely old age is one of the most pitiable
conditions: of life. The secret of avoid-
ing this fate is “to find ways and means
for giving old people new interest in
life.”

There are new interests for this} Sales.

time of life and one does not have to
organize or join a club to find them,
though such a club may be a help to
some. The best club of this kind is the
Christian church which has a horizon a
wide as the world and is ever full of
new and interesting things. ‘They that
be planted in the house of the Lord shal!
flourish in the courts of our God. They
shall still bring forth fruit in old age:
they shall be fat and flourishing.” —

FRANKLIN'S IDEA.

A year ago, when the hyphenated St.
Louis concern which brews so much false
advertising was touting Benjamin
Franklin as an exemplary consumer of
beer, we ventured to publish a page from
his autobiography which told of his total-
abstinence principles based on economic
and physical reasons. Recently another
writer, commenting upon the extent to
which certain great industrial corpora-
tions are carrying their fight against
liquor, again summoned Franklin to ob-
serve the application of his ideas, Here,
for instance, is the notice posted through
out the Joliet Works of the Illinois Steel
Company: *

NOTICE

To the employes of the Joliet Works,
[llinois Steel Company.

For the promotion of safety and wel
fare, it is hoped that all employes will
avoid the use of intoxicating liquors.

* Under the rules of the Joliet Works,
any employe who uses intoxicating liquor
while on duty will be discharged.

In making promotions in any depart-
ment of the plant, superintendents of de
partments and foremen will select for
promotion only those who do not use in-
toxicating liquors.

At the plant of the same company at
Gary, Ind., a flaming electric sign at the
gate burns these uncomfortable — ques-
tions into every man’s mind:

Did booze ever do you any good?

Did booze ever get you a better job?

Did booze ever contribute anything to
the happiness of your family?

Franklin the printer might have que-
ried the word “booze,” but when that
was explained to his satisfaction, _ he
would certainly have set his “O. K."
upon the intimations of the illuminated
and. illuminating questions.—N. Y. Ad-

NO DIVIDED SERIVE.

The weekly lesson in Sunday school
dealt, with the corrupting influence of
luxury and worldliness, and the golden
text was a well-known sentence that thr
stiperintendent wished all the children
to remember.

It sounded like an easy text to learn
and the superintendent, mounting — the
platform for a final review of the lesson
when the school assembled for closing
exercises, was sure of a pleasing response
from his pupils.

“Who,” he began, “can repeat the
golden text?”

A score of hands were raised, and the
superintendent chose a little girl with
blue eyes, a well-bred, well-behaved lit-
tle girl from a well-to-do and particular
family, to repeat the text for him.

“Well, Dorothy,” he said, “you may
tell it to us. Stand up, so we can all
hear you.”

Dorothy stood up in the prettiness of
her best dress and the daintiness of her
hair ribbons,

“You can not,” she said distinctly—
“you can not serve God and mamma.”—

in the spiritual life than to be contin-
ually beginning afresh.—St. Francis de
