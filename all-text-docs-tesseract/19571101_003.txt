ICEMEN INVASION: Pucks get frozen, fans get
chilled by the ice, players by other means, and the
1957-58 ice hockey season opens tonight in Charlotte’s
Coliseum. New Haven clashes with the Charlotte Clip-
pers, owners of last year’s league championship and
playoff crown and a two and one record going into to-|,

RESCHEDULE P. C.? — DON'T BOTHER:
Coach Bill Dole squeiched any rumors of possible
re-scheduled games, stating that the Presbyterian
game has not been reset for a later date, contrary
to some earlier reports. Wofford, Richmond, and
Furman remain on the schedule

WILOCAT SOCCER STAI

BUG BITES BENSON: Because of the two Satur-
jay's of idleness. Charlie Benson fell in his Conference
ranking in both total offense and passing. standings. His
339 yards passing (on 28 completions) and 496 total of-
fense yardage ranks him behind Citadel's Bob Schwarze
and Furman’s Billy: Baker, who completed 27 of 40 at-
tempts last week for 292 vards. Benson will be one game
short at the season’s end and will have to be extra sharp . .
the rest of the way to pull in front of his sophomore rival. After having their g

ponents: home field.

PLAGUE PROVES A POINT: For three weeks
Davidson has suffered through its plague of flu without
a single athletic contest being staged. Could be that it
qasn't gotten to you yet, but it sure dulls morale and spirit
on campus and makes a sports page difficult to write.
It should go a long way towards discouraging any ideas
of a less subsidized athletic program that always seem to
crop up.

DRIBBLE DERBY: Were disappointed to see
that Street and Smith ranked the Cat cagers only a
prospective seventh in Southern Conference stand-
ings in their preview mag. V.M.I, was ranked below
the locals and West Virginia, although minus their
side-show in Hot Rod Hundley, rates top spot.

KEARNS LEARNS TO WILT STILT: Whose
pix was on the cover of the afore-mentioned magazine?
Tommy Kearns, of course. But who did Dell Sport
publication put on their front? The gangling Stilt that
Kearns helped to chop down to size some seven months
ago in Kansas City. Take your pick and remember that
the cover is a good indication of what is on the inside.

Furman on the local range.

TAR HEELS TELEVISED: Four regional tele-
casts of North Carolina basketball games will be
available to viewers in the South. On December 7
at Chapel Hill against Clemson and at Clemson on
January 17. Also South Carolina and Duke at Woolen
Gym on December 14 and February 8.

Richmond Hosts
Wildcat Harriers

By JIM HAMILTON
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The flu-crippled Wildcat har-
\ riers journey north this week-
end to meet the University of
Richmond tomorrow.

Coach Heath Whittle, with
half of his squad out. or re.
cuperating from. the effects of
the flu bug, is anything but
optimistic about the meet.

Two meets this year have
already been cancelled due
to the epidemic. VM! was
forced to call off the tri-
angular meet with Davidson
and Washington and Lee,
and Davidson’s own epi-
demic put the damper on
the N. C. State-William and
Mary affair.

BAD LUCK

Prom coach Whittle’s point of
view bad Juck has run with the
Cats all season Cross country
is a sport requiring at least a
month of conditioning, and duc;
to the schedule and Rush Week.
the Wildcats had only two weeks '
to prepare for the opening meet
with Duke. Badly out of shape,
they lost, 19 to 41, to the Blue!
Devils.

A later loss to Wake Forest
was. also accredited in part to.
lack of condition and the flu.

The bright spot of the
season has been the run-
ning of Angus McBryde.
The Cat captain finished
second in the Duke meet
behind Cary Weisiger, who
set a new course record
of 22 minutes, 25 seconds.
McBryde finished in 23:02.

McBryde was the number one,
man for the locals against Wake
Forest, also, even though he
managed only a fourth place.’
He covered the approximately |
four-mile course at Winston-
Salem in 22:51, compared to the|
winning time of 20.45, by Med-,
