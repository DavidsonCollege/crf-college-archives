P. E. Pass/Fail Grades To Appear On Transcript

By JEFF LESESNE

The Faculty Committee on
Physical Education decided that
passing and failing grades in PE
will become a permanent part of
the students’ transcipts starting in
the fall. Director of Physical Edu-
cation and Intramurals Sterling
Martin said, “This was done at the
request of this office and the regis-
trar’s office.”

According to Martin, one
reason for the decision was to stop
students from signing up for a PE
course and then overcutting.
When students do not attend the
required number of classes, usu-
ally 75 percent, they receive a fail-
ing grade. Referring to failures
Martin said, “The only reason, for
the most part, is overcutting.”

A PE department study
shows that in the winter term of
83-84 there were 666 registrations
for PE classes. Out of these, 287
were passes and 360 were fail-
ures. 91 percent of these failures
were from students not showing
up. In the spring of 83-84 and fall
of 84-85 PE grades appeared on
the report cards. The data for this
winter show that 457 passing

grades and 181 failing grades
were issued. Martin said, “Obvi-
ously there was a change in at-
titude.”

Because due notice was not
given, PE failures for these terms
have since been removed from
transcripts. The grades will begin
to appear on the transcripts in the
fall of the 85-86 school year and
will remain thereafter.

The second reason, according
to Martin, for allowing PE grades
to be on the transcripts is to end
confusion in the registrar’s office.
PE grades are recorded on a grade
report sheet to give students credit
for passing a PE class. This re-
cording automatically puts the
grades on the student’s report card
and transcript. The registrar,
therefore, has to remove the PE
grades manually every time some-
one needs a transcript, and this
causes confusion.

Martin and the Faculty Com-
mittee feel it is the student's re-
sponsibility to drop undesired PE
classes from their schedules. He
said, “The record a student gener-
ates should be permanent.”

According to Martin no per-

son should fail a PE. The drop
period for PE’s has been extended
to two weeks. In case of an injury
or sickness the student may get an
authorized withdrawal. There is
also a medical excuse for thse who
cannot participate.

Martin feels, “This is a fairly
painless requirement.” The com-
mittee reduced the requirement
from five to four credits and
moved the deadline from senior
year to sophomore year to end
confusion at graduation.

Martin suggested at an SGA °

meeting that a brochure be made
to inform faculty advisors and stu-
dents of the requirements in the
PE area and also in each PE class.
The plans have not been worked
out but Martin believes it would
help end much of the confusion
and rumors spread about the PE
requirements.

Martin also said he is willing
to help anyone who has any ques-
tions or problems. He welcomes
Students to come to the PE office
and check on their records, and he
urged them not to wait until the
last minute to do so.

Grigsby Speaks On Institutionalized Sexism /Racism

By ANDREA DIEDRICH
Sociology ~ Professor Janet
Grigsby spoke on sexism, racism,

of Peace Week. Grigsby’s talk
centered on sexism and violence
with an emphasis on the problem
of wife battering.

Grigsby explained that pre-
judiced attitudes are not limited to
the individual; social structures
are just as influential in dis-
criminatory practices whether
they intend to be or not. She gave
several examples of this uninten-
tional “institutionalized racism
and sexism” at Davidson. One ex-
ample is that fewer black students

are accepted at Davidson than
white students because the
strongest recruitment of students
occurs at high schools that have
traditionally sent students to
Davidson. These schools are
primarily white schools.

An example of in-
stitutionalized sexism Grigsby
suggested is the allocation of
funds within the athletic depart-

‘ment. Men’s sports have tradi-

tionally drawn the greatest audi-
ences and, because most David-
son alumni are men, they also
draw the greatest alumni support.
For these reasons men’s sports re-
ceive more financial support than

women’s sports. As Grigsby
pointed out, both of these prac-
tices seem. very rational but are
still founded on prejudice.

Grigsby explained that there is
no substantial evidence that
sexism is the cause of wife batter-
ing, but she believes that the prob-
lem can be understood through the
concepts of power and domination
and sex-role attitudes.

In traditional terms men have
more power than women. Grigsby
believes “This results from
women’s exclusion from direct
access tO economic resources.”
She believes, ‘Men resort to vio-
lence when they don’t have access

‘Tremendously Successful’ Fund Drive

to other methods of power (for ex-
ample when a man loses his job).”
In situations where the men do
wield a great deal of power,
Grigsby believes if violence does
occur it is likely that it will con-
tinue because the man maintains
so much control over the woman.

Grigsby believes that sex role
attitudes contribute to the problem
of wife battering. She said, ‘““Trad-
itional sex role attitudes involve
the idea that women are the prop-
erty of their husbands.” Certain
widespread norms also contribute
to the problem Grigsby said that
many people believe “being hit

turns women on” and “women in-
tentionally provoke men. to vio-
lence and then blame them.” She
also explained: that many women
believe so strongly that “marriage
is for keeps” that violence in a
marriage often goes unstopped.

Grigsby also believes that
some institutional processes sup-
port violence such as wife batter-
ing. She said, “That aspect is the
most distressing part of analyzing
wife battering for me. The very
organizations that are designed to
assist women with the problem
end up continuing the problem or
initiating it.”

Class Of 1985 Subsidizes Minority Scholarship

By NELLE McCORKLE

The Senior Class Gift Com-
mittee has collected $48,000 thus
far in its campaign to establish an
endowment for minority scholar-
ships, according to Gift Commit-
tee Co-Chairperson Martha Nel-
son. Nelson, co-chair with Shep
Robinson, said the pledges re-
ceived came from 196 seniors,
adding that the campaign is not
over, with 100 students yet to be
solicited. The class intends to
raise $65,000 over a five-year
period.

The endowment will provide a
renewable, four-year scholarship
to one minority student in each en-
tering freshman class, worth $600
annually. Based on both need and
merit, the scholarship seeks “out-
standing students who will con-
tribute to campus life,” according
to the Gift Committee brochure.

Minority, for the purposes of the
scholarship selection, is defined
by the brochure as including “any-
one from a racial or ethnic back-
ground not in the majority at
Davidson.” Students — selected
must maintain a minimum 2.5
grade average to continue receiv-
ing the scholarship. According to
the regulations established by the
endowment, a committee com-
posed of faculty members, admin-
istrators, and a student scholar-
ship recipient will aid the Faculty
Committee on Admissions and Fi-
nancial Aid in selecting the schol-
arship winners.

The class of 1985 chose the
minority scholarship program as
its senior gift project by a class
vote. Of this selection, Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid
John Griffith commented: “There
is no greater gift alumni can give

the next generation of students
than the financial possibility of
obtaining a Davidson education.
In order for Davidson to continue
its mission of serving all qualified
students without regard to their fi-
nancial circumstances and to en-
hance our efforts to serve students
from diverse racial/ethnic groups,
it is essential that scholarship
funds, both need and merit based,
be a priority of alumni giving. |
am delighted by the commitment
the Class of 1985 has made to ad-
dressing these needs.”

To obtain the scholarship
money, the solicitation process in-
volves individual visits to seniors
by members of their class, trained
at an orientation session in obtain-
ing pledges. Eighty brokers from
the Class of 1985 were each as-
signed about three seniors, ac-
cording to Gift Committee mem-

ber Susie Myers.

The Gift Committee itself’ is
comprised of twelve members, al-
most all of whom are also brokers,
Myers said. Members of the Gift
Committee are: Blake Carpenter.
Walker Douglas, David Gaffney,
Warren Gould, Tony Holt, Susie
Myers, Martha Nelson, Ellen
Papadeas, Shep Robinson, Meg
Surratt, Mike Wilkinson, Atondra
Williams.

Cissi Fulenwider, assistant di-
rector of alumni relations and a
major administrative contact for
the project for the past three years.
said, “The Class of ‘85 so far has
been tremendously successful” in
obtaining its current 61 percent
participation rate. Citing other
colleges’ average 30 percent par-
ticipation rate, Fulenwider added,
“With so many people involved.

{the class} will probably have a
higher pay rate than the donor
rate.” Recent past class gifts have
endowed a general scholarship
fund (Class of 1983) and a schol

arship fund for Davidson students
studying abroad (Class of 1984),

Of the gift’ plans for 1985,
College President John Kuyden-
dall commented, “Every student
who comes to Davidson College ts
influenced, directly or indirectly,
by the way in which we make use
of our scholarship dollars. Many
of us have been able to augment
our own resources by the assist-
ance that the college provides.
Many others among us have had
our lives enriched by fellow stu-
dents who might otherwise have
been unable to afford a Davidson
education.”
