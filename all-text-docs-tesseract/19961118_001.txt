College unveils plans to save energy

By Grec GARRISON
Staff Writer

Last spring, a task force made
seven recommendations for low-

ering the:college’s $1.75 million

annual energy bill.

There were suggestions for ef-
ficient use of all facilities, possible
user charges for some utilities, an
engineering study, and an “energy
awareness” campaign.

Last month, college President
John Kuykendall responded to the

group’s recommendations by say-
ing that all of them would be imple-
mented, except for the system of
user charges.
Usercharges would determine

»the amountof energy tised by each’

department and charge them ac-
cordingly.

Although it was tabled by |

Kuykendall because of its lack of
feasibility, he says that the system
would be reconsidered after the
metering system is installed.

The physical plantis currently

installing the metering system,
which has an estimated $100,000
price tag. The Task Force on Effi-
ciency is providing $25,000 of this.

Kuykendall says that
Davidson"s* building projects go
beyond code requirements for en-
ergy use,

He also says that per square
foot energy use is well below most
national and regional colleges and
universities.

’98-’99 calendar will
observe MLK Day

By ALEX OBREGON
Staff Writer

The Faculty Executive
Committee’s recent decision to
cancel afternoon classes on Martin
Luther King Day in January will
be effective beginning the 1998-

1999 academic year.
As word of the academic cal-
endar change spread, the

committee’s decision prompted
debate among students, as well as
in the Student Government Asso-
ciation Senate.

The question of whether
Davidson College should recog-
nize Veteran’s Day as a national
holiday by canceling classes has
been raised by several students on
campus.

Traditionally, Davidson has
not canceled classes to recognize
Veteran’s Day, Martin Luther King
Day, or any other national holiday.
As a result, any activities or pro-
gramming pertaining to them had
to be scheduled around classes and
often on weekends.

Because of the importance of

the issue of race relations during
the" fie” Of Martin Luther King,
and even now on this and college
campuses everywhere, the Execu-
tive committee felt it should give
the students a better chance to rec-
ognize and celebrate Dr. King’s
achievements.

However, some students won-

der why other national holidays,

Dees Ta
‘thes

such as Veteran’s Day, are not
given the same attention.

At the November 5 SGA meet-
ing, junior class senator Eric Sapp
proposed aresolution which would
give Veteran’s day the same rec-
ognition that has recently been
given to Martin Luther King Day.

Although some students op-
pose this idea, saying Veteran’s
Day has little relevance to student
life, Sapp, along with other stu-
dents and Davidson’s chapter of
ROTC, responds that veterans have
played a great part in the lives of
the students and should be justly
recognized.

As stated in Sapp’s proposed
resolution, “We owe our veterans
an incredible debt for the sacri-
fices and risks that have taken for
our sakes ... this debt obligates us
not to forget these men and women
or the holiday that was created to
honor their memory.”

He also points out that due to
Davidson’s policy of mandatory
ROTC, which ended in the 1960s,

many of the college’s graduates
are veterans.

In the past, events celebrating
specific holidays have been sched-
uled around classes to commemo-
rate Martin Luther King Day,
Veteran’s Day and other nation-
ally recognized holidays.

Are Davidson standards too steep for summa?
Percentages for Latin honors lower than at other schools

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL
News Editor

For the past 20 years,
Davidson seniors hoping to gradu-
ate cum laude had to maintain a B+
average. Now, however, some
students argue that, due to recent
changes in the grade point scale,
cum laude requirements are harder
than ever to meet.

When the “minus grading sys-
tem” was introduced in 1991,
Davidson recognized “minus
grades,” for example A-, for the
first time. In light of this change,
the entire Grade Point Average
scale shifted; a B+ is now not what
it used to be, in terms of grade
point value.

In 1991 the GPA value of aB+
fell from 3.5 to 3.3, and although a
B+ student’s GPA fell with the

“scale conversion, Davidson’s Latin
honors requirements remained the
same.

Davidson awards cum laude
honors to graduates with GPAs of
3.5. (See box at right.)

From 1984 to 1994, the per-
centage of seniors who earned Latin
honors remained fairly stable, hov-
ering between 18.05% and 21.05%.

Of the 390 members of the
Class of ‘95 — Davidson’s first
class to have studied all four years
under the minus grading system —
the percentage of Latin honors re-
cipients dropped to 16.92%.

“Last year was a dip, which is
unusual,” says Registrar Polly W.
Griffin.

According to an article which
appeared in the Wall Street Jour-
nal in 1994, 90% of all under-
graduate grades awarded at

Stanford University were As and
Bs. At Harvard University, As and
Bs constituted 73% of all grades
awarded.

Griffin says, “Every school
defines their Latin Honors as they
will.”

At Williams College, typically
regarded as one of Davidson’s peer
institutions, cum laude honors are
awarded to graduating seniors with
3.3 GPAs.

A recent Yale University
policy limits that percentage of
students graduating with honors to
30%. In past years, according to
the Wall Street Journal, as many as
one half of Yale graduates earned
such honors.

Liz Abernathy, Chair of
Davidson’s Council on Academic
Affairs, says the Council is moni-
toring the honors situation at

Davidson.

Two years ago, the Council
submitted a proposal to the Educa-
tional Policy Committee, urging

that Latin honors requirements be
modified in accord with grade scale
changes caused by the introduc-
tion of “minus grading.”
