Men’s Hoops Travels to Italy

By WILL RoBERSON
Foreign Correspondent

The Davidson basketball squad got

the 2001-02 season off to an early start

as they returned from their two-week
Italian tour with a 5-1 record. The ‘Cats
played Italian pro teams from various
levels, with the final four opponents
coming from Italy’s first division.

In fhe first game of the tour, the Wild-

cats placed six players in double figures
in a 100-66 defeat of Serrano Basket.

The game remained close throughout
the first quarter, with Davidson holding
a slim 25-23 advantage behind Peter
Anderer’s 12 points. The ‘Cats began to
turn it on in the second quarter, extend-
ing their lead to 52-38 at the break.
Wayne Bernard tallied 10 points in the
second period, including an acrobatic
follow dunk of a missed shot.

The second half was all Davidson, as
the Wildcats only allowed 9 points in the
fourth quarter while extending the lead
to the final 34-point margin. For the
game, senior forward Emeka Erege led
the way for the ‘Cats with 20 points.

“(Davidson Offensive Lineman] Jon
Davis...Not only does he hold himself to a high
standard academically but also strives to per-
form at an extremely high level in football.”

Sophomore Jouni Eho contributed a
double-double with 11 points and 13
rebounds, while Anderer finished the
day with 14 points. Also scoring in
“double figures were Bernard with 14
points and 9 rebounds, junior Chris
Pearson with 14 points and 8 rebounds,
and sophomore guard Nick Booker, who
added 10 points.

Davidson followed up that win with an-
other impressive victory, an 87-43 thrash-
ing of the Milano-All-Stars. The Wildcats
scored the final 15 points of the first quar-
ter to break open the game, led by Peter
Anderer, who scored 8 in the outburst. As
the game progressed, the ‘Cats continued
to shut down Milano’s offense, jumping to
a 50-25 halftime lead and a 72-32 margin
at the end of three quarters. Erege again
led the Wildcats in scoring, contributing
15 points. Pearson garnered his first
double-double of the trip, recording 13
points and 10 rebounds. Bernard was the
other Davidson player in double figures
with 13 points, and Eho recorded double-
digit rebounds for the second straight game
with 12.

In their third game of the trip, the Wild-
cats needed a late run to pull away from
Castel Maggoire 96-84. Pearson netted
perhaps the most impressive stat line of
the trip, scoring 24 points and grabbing 19
rebounds, nearly missing a rare “20-20.”
The Wildcats jumped out to a big 48-32
lead near the end of the first half, but a late
run by Castel Maggoire shrunk the Wild-
cat lead to 51-44 at the half. Castel
Maggoire continued their good play in the

| third quarter, and actually took the lead

71-69 late in the third. But a barrage of
three pointers by the Wildcats, one each by
Anderer, Bernard, and senior guard Fern
Tonella jump-started a 13-0 run to put
Davidson back in control. In addition to
Pearson, Erege also recorded a double-
double, with 11 points and 10 rebounds.
Junior Bernard was also solid again, scor-
ing 14 points. Senior point guard Michael
Bree directed the Wildcat attack, scoring
10 points, dishing out eight assists, and
grabbing five rebounds

The Wildcats celebrated Jouni Eho’s
birthday with an 84-74 victory over Imola,
an A-1 division team. The game was close
throughout, with Davidson leading 39-34
at the half behind 14 points from Erege.
Imola made a fourth-quarter run to put a
scare in the ‘Cats, but Davidson held on for
the ten-point margin. Erege finished the
game with 20 points, while junior center
Martin Ides contributed a double-double
with 10 points and 12 rebounds. Pearson
followed up his monster game with 13
points and 7 rebounds, while Bernard
again reached double figures with 14.
Eho was a perfect 4-4 shooting on his
birthday, finishing with 10 points and
four rebounds. |
