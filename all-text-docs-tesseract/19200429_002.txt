THE DAVIDSONIAN, April 29, 1920.

JUNIORS AND SOPHS LEAD
IN INTER-CLASS SERIES

Games Thus Far Played Slow and
Uninteresting.

Not a few students paid their lone
jit Monday to see the Juniors over-
come the Seniors on Sprunt field in
the first of the inter-class baseball
games, by the close score of 5 to 4.
The Juniors scored two in the sec-
ond, but the Seniors came back with
such force that the beginning of the
eighth found them leading 4-2. The
Juniors pushed one across in both
the eighth and ninth, thus tying the
score. Douglas’ muff of Hodgin’s
long drive in the tenth gave them
the game 5 to 4. .

Batteries — Seniors:
Brady and McConnell ;
Romefelt and Walker.

Fresh-Soph Game —

Did any of your miss this won-
derful exhibition of America’s great-
est game last Tuesday? Of course
no one expected you to = stay
throughout the whole game, for
even the greater part of the 75
Fresh aspiring for their team de-
serted before the end was reached,
Inning after inning, the Sophs trot-
ted around the bases until in the
ninth, when they stopped with the
apropriate number of 22 runs, the
Fresh receiving 4 in the meantime.
The features of the game were the
chasing of fliés by the “23rs” and
the hitting of the whole Soph team.

Batteries—Sophs: Murphy. and
McFadden; Fresh: Sorrells and Mc-
Cutchin.

“What About That Class Reunion?”

D. C. GOLFERS BREAK
EVEN WITH SALISBURY IN
WELL PLAYED MATCHES

Fore! The match was on! Tee-
ing off for the Davidson College
Gulf Club were Professor Arbuckle
and Professors Wood, White and
Sample, while Messrs. Hennessee,
Hennessee, Pickens and Walker did
the trick for the Salisbury Golf
Club. Playing over the recently
built and as yet incompleted golf
course of the Salisbury club on the
afternoon of April 19, 1920, the two
teams, after a hard fought and in-
teresting match, arrived at the last
green with the honors divided.

As an additional proof that age
and experience can’t be beat, it was
the team composed of Professors
Arbuckle and Wood that saved the
day for Davidson. The playing of
these two gentlemen was consistent
throughout and at times attained
the brillant strokesmanship of pro-
fessional play. Their younger col-
leagues, White and Sample, played
consistent golf but were not able to
hold up to the standard set by their
opponents. The Salisbury team
played its usual consistent game,
but were not able to overcome the
flashy playing of the Professors.

The Davidson team was accorded
delightful entertainment and had a
most enjoyable trip.

Davidson’s track team won its
third victory in eight days when the
“Speed Boys” took Clemson into
camp to the tune of 52-47, The meet
was full of excitement from begin-
ning to end. Davidson held the lead
for the first few moments, but Clem-
son soon began piling up points un-
til the score stood Clemson 37, Da-
vidson 26, with only four events
left. Davidson won three of these
and came second in another and won
the meet. e

Clemson won seven of the eleven
events, but Davidson won eight sec-
ond places and eight thirds and
saved the day for the Red and
Black.

There were several good records
made during the day. The most
notable of these were: Striebeck’s
shotput of 39 feet, 4.5 inches; Col-
bert’s discus throw of 116 feet; and
Boggs’ pole vault of 10 feet 6 inches.
Voigt made good time in the dashes
by taking the 100 yard dash in 10
seconds and the 220 in 22 2-5 sec-
onds,

Captain Murray, of Davidson, was
the high point winner of the day. He
took 12 points during the day. Voigt,
of Clemson, ran him a close second
with 11 points. Murray was handi-
capped by a sore knee and a weak
ankle. He did not place in the broad
jump.

The meet was in doubt until the
last race, the 220 low hurdles. Da-
vidson had to take a first or second
place to win the meet. This race
had to be run by time. When the
time of the runners had been com-
pared it was found that Davidson
had won second and third places. *

The Wildcats are still on the
heavy side of the percentage
column, having won 6 and -lost 5.
These results are only those com-
plied through the last game of. the
North Carolina trip.

The results in hitting on the Caro-
lina trip, caused the averages of
most of the Clan to tumble. As a
result the batting order is well
shaken up. The team is hitting as
follows :

Miley’s no-hit game against Elon
Monday was a sensational affair.
“Bill” allowed only one man to

was cut off at second. Besides
pitching the masterful game, “Bill”
slammed out a single, a triple and
walked in three trips to the plate.

REPORTERS’ CLUB
HOLDS FEED

Plenty of Pep a Feature—Old and
New Officers Hold Floor.

Last Thursday night was gala
night for The Davidsonian scribes.
lt was feed night for the Reporters’
Club. The regular club, the Fresh-
man reporters, and all who have
been writing at all were present.

T. H. Spence presided over the
head-end of the table. Besides be-
ing the chief money-getter, he prov-
ed to be’a very capable speech get-
ter.

he delegated two Freshmen to give
a yell—and he got the horse laugh.

When the eats had disappeared
and the boys had stopped opening
coco-cola, Spence introduced the of-
ficers chosen for next year. Bitzer,
as secretary and treasurer, impor-
tuned the members to be regular in
attendance at meetings and help the
secretary. Summers, the vice-pres-
ident-to-be, gave a short, snappy
speech on the weather and other
prevailing conditions. Mitchell, the
president-elect, delivered an inter-
esting and instructing address in
which he outlined the platform
which he hopes to inaugurate dur-
ing his term in office.

After all the eats had disappeared,
and all the hot air had been exhaust-
ed, the room was turned over to a
delegation of Freshmen and the
boys retired downstairs, where Mc-
Ihwaine stood ready to strike at
their beauty.

“Wooley” Grey, our next year’s
football coach, was up to the David-
son-Clemson meet Saturday. “Wool-
ey” expects to put out a real old-
time team next fall.

After having speeches from.
the most prominent (?) men present ,

Cape of Good Hope—Sweet six-
teen.

Cape Flattery—Twenty.

Cape Lookout—Thirty.

Cape Farewell—Forty.

—Ward-Belmont Hyphen.
