Wahoos Run Away From Cats

By Bruce Balestier

Itdidn’tlook good for the Wild-
cats early during their game with
Virginia in Charlottesville last
Monday night.

The 18th-ranked Cavaliers,
still smarting from an embarassing
loss to Georgia Tech the previous
Saturday, were looking for some-
thing upon which to unleash their
frustrations, and were beginning
to think they had found it in the
“Cats when they sprinted to an 8-2
lead.

Oddly enough, though,
Davidson fought back, and fast
break lay ups by Jason Zimmer-
man and Pat Holloway tied the
game at 8-8 and provoked UVa
coach Jeff Jones to call timeout to
calm his flustered charges.

Cats Lose

By Bruce Balestier

Detlef Musch came out of the
locker room Saturday night look-
ing like the 7 foot intimidator
people have always expected him
to be. Still in only his sixth season
of organized basketball, the im-
proving Musch was as aggressive
as he has been in a Davidson uni-
form.

He scored the first eight points
of the game against Augusta, in-
cluding twoonan impressive slam,
to stake the Wildcats to an early 8-
5 lead. His 10 points and 4 re-
bounds in the first half led the
‘Cats to a 33-30 halftime lead.

It was much the same story in
the second half. A Musch basket
with 7:28 to go gave Davidson its
largest lead of the second half at
55-51 before foul trouble (account-
able in part to some very question-
able officiating) forced him to leave

8 advantage before the ‘Cats con-
tinued their charge.

Seven straight points from
Janko Narat, capped by a three-
pointer from the corner, culminated
a 15-3 spurt that put Davidson in
front 17-11.

Unfortunately, Virginia satis-
fied the restless throng at Univer-
sity Hall by holding the Wildcats
scoreless for more than eight min-
utes. and scoring 15 unanswered
points to take a 26-17 lead. Once
again, though, Davidson re-
sponded, and three-pointers by Pat
Holloway and Paul Denmond
pulled the ‘Cats within 28-23 at the
half.

Davidson coach Bob McKil-
lop said after the game that “we
wanted to keep the game as low-
scoring as possible, as ugly as
possible,” and the relatively close
halftime score was a reflection of

the success of that strategy.

But Virginia coach Jeff Jones
said a mouthful when he said that
it seemed that “there were, two
different games out there”.

Just for the record, the one that
didn’t go well for Davidson was
the one that coincided with the
second half.

The Cavaliers turned up the
defense anotch, limiting the Wild-
cats to just 6 points in the first 10
minutes of the second half, and ran
roughshod over the Davidson de-
fense, assuming an authoritative
54-29 lead with 8:59 to play.

The Wahoos enjoyed their
largest lead at 63-35 with 3:57 left,
and cruised to a 71-47 triumph.

Pat Holloway paced the Wild-
cats with 13 points. James Marsh
and the rapidly improving Detlef
Musch garnered nine rebounds
apiece.

In OT To Augusta

the game. With Muschon the bench
with four fouls, no Wildcat (not
even Janko Narat, who finished
with 21 points) was able to step up
and score and no one was able to
stop Augusta’s Keenan Mann, who
lit it up for 26 points,.24 after
halftime.

Thus, with 1:35 to play, the
“Cats found themselves down 62-
56. Two free throws by Musch cut
the lead to 62-58, and a three-point
play by James Marsh drew the
Wildcats within 63-61 with :39
left.

Following a missed Augusta
free throw, Davidson came down
the court looking for the tying hoop,
and the Belk Arena crowd went
wild when Janko Narat, after an
offensive rebound, put in the lay
up to tie the game at 63-63 and
send it into overtime.

But when Musch fouled out

with 3:48 left in the extra session,
the game was effectively over. The
‘Cats once again faced a 6 point
deficit with 1:35 left, but by then
Narat, too, had fouled out. The
Jaguars made enough foul shots to
cruise to an 81-72 win.

Augusta coach Clint Bryant
spewed out the regular cliches,
saying that the Wildcats “showed
alotofcharacter” and that he knows
“what those growing pains are
like,” but they were little consola-
tion after the difficult loss.

Musch finished with a season-
high 20 points and 8 rebounds. Pat
Holloway, Jason Zimmerman and
James Marsh each chipped in with
9 points. The Wildcats, now 5-13,

South Carolina Guns
Down Wildcats

By Bruce Page

Wednesday night the young
Davidson Wildcats suffered an-
other setback, losing at home, 85-
57, to a star-studded University of
South Carolina team.

Tough defense by the 25th-
ranked Gamecocks and early turn-
overs by the Wildcats helped USC
jump out to a 9-0 lead.

The Wildcats attempted to
regain their composure, battling to

Davidson on the inside, scoring 34
of their points on layups or dunks.

One point of encouragement
for the Wildcats came from the
inspired play of sophomore J.D.
Heuer, who scored acareer high 11
points on 5 of 7 shooting from the
field.

Heuer led the team in scoring
despite playing only 12 minutes.

within 11-8 deficit, but South
Carolina broke the game open with
a 15-2 run, eventually racing toa
40-19 halftime lead.

USC’s stifling defense forced
the Wildcats into 28% shooting for
the game, while the Gamecocks
converted on 52% of their field
goals, '

South Carolina also dominated

freshmen anda sophomore against
USC’s 4 juniors and one senior.

Nonetheless, Davidson coach
Bob McKillop-sees this game as a
beneficial learning experience for
his young team. McKillop says his
team “learned how far we have to
go” and stated that there is “tre-
mendous value in this kind of
experience.”
