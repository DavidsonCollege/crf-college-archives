Student Council Mulls

Years’ Intentions, NSA |

By LOUIS BURTON

Two issues came before the Student Council Monday night as it prepared to
determine its policies for 1959-60.

Tommy Colvin suggested
that the Council join the Na-
tional Student Association.
Bobby Avinger later proposed
a policy for’ Student Council
meetings which aims at bridg-
ing the student-administration
gap.

“t think ther the Student
Council shovid move from
the position of a discussion
group te become a dynamic,
active organizstion on cam-
pus”, stated Colvin. He went
on to describe how NSA
would help the Council be-
come such an organization.

The primary unit in the NSA
is the student body. The Asso-
ciation provides several ser-

Recognition At Drill

By B. MILLNER

R.0.T.C. urigade Commander
First Col. Bob Croom added
another laurel to his growing
collection last Tuesday as he
received the Reserve Officers
Association Medal for outstand-
ing performance at summer
camp. Col. William L. Adams
made the presentation at drill.

This is the first time the
award has been given to a Da-
vidson cadet. Adams said, how-
ever, that it would now be an
annual recognition.

The award is made entirely
on the basis of the cadet’s per-
formance during the six-week
summer program at Fort
Bragg. Croom was earlier se-

vices for the member colleges:
special publications, assistance
in programming campus ‘activi-
ties, various exchange pro-
grams, and resource services.

For the student the NSA has
available conferences, scholar-
ships (including foreign study),
a special low-cost student
travel agency, and participation
in exchange programs between
campi.

As an example of these ser-
vices to the individual student,
NSA had 700 students to par-
ticipate last year in its low
cost foreign travel program.

After some discussion Dee
Green tabled the issue until
the next meeting when it will
be acted on.

Bobby Avinger inquired as
to whet the Council intended
to do during the year. Point-
ing out thet judiciel functions
were now given to the Honer
Court, only tegistative plen-
ning was left to the Student
Council under the tradition-
al system. And Bob com-
mented, “1 can’t see what we
cen legislate.”

He went on to express his

as a forum or seminar with
the Student Councit incor-
porating the concensus of
student cpinion info recom-
mendations to be presented
to the administration-faculty.

Colvin injected that the NSA
would be of aid in this type of
program, supplying research in-
formation and data-from stu-
dent bodies of similar colleges.

To study the proposal furth-
er and to organize other recom-
mendations, Green appointed a
committee: Jim Bootle, Freddy
Lane, and Avinger, chairman.

Green immediately backed
the opinion and clarified the
past action of the Council.
