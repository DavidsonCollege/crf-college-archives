Saturday will be: the second Barium

Davidson. This is one place that cer-
tainly deserves “a day” at Davidson.

The institution has, undoubtedly, con-

other in the country, so it is the least
Davidson can do to extend a hearty wel-

make “Barium Springs Day" a tradi-
tidnal institution in the yearly program
of the college.
SPRING HERE
As spring peers around the cor-
ner the sports world turns its
thoughts and attention from the
hardwood and.«mat to the dia-

mond, cinderpath and other parts

of the terrain where outdoor
games are played in the warm sea-
sons.

We have gotten a glimpse already of
what the Wildcats should have in the
track department this season, but noth-
ing has been revealed up to this time
about baseball prospects. It would seem,
however, that Coach Laird should put
a rather formidable nine on the dia-
mond. He has a number of lettermen
from the 1934 club, several reserves of
last season will be bidding fair for po-
sition, and there is some very promising
talent among the ones rising from the
yearling outfit of a year ago.

Pitchers are, of course, the big
problem on any baseball team, and
the Wildcat mentor is extremely
fortunate in having two star let-
termen hurlers back for the /1935
campaign. They are Charlie Har-
ris and Jack Jenkins, both of
whom twirl in the orthodox fash-
ion, and show plenty of stuff when
the time comes. ;

With these two veterans on hand as
a nucleus, Coach Laird should present
a crew of competent moundsmen, which
will be a tremendous stride, toward build-
ing one of those “air-tight, hit-proof”

The Davidson Wildcats, with ten let-
termen back this season, went through
their initial practice early this week.
Eighteen games, sixteen of which are
against the other four “Big Five” nines,
are booked for Coach Laird’s proteges.

With ten lettermen back the outlook
for the Davidson nine this season is very
bright. The returning lettermen are as
follows: Infielders, Johnny Mackorell,
Floyd Bumgarner, atid “Woody” Burns;
outfielders, Teal Rogers and Jim Mor-
gan; pitchers, Charley Harris, Jack
Jenkins and Paul Coble; catchers,
“Wimpy” Ravenel and George Wingfield.

The intield seems to be pretty well
fixed for this season, At the initial sack
Burns is back and should hold down the

sack, although Tom Corbin will give
him plenty of competition. At the key-
stone, sack will be found Bumgarner,

with Mackorell at the hot corner, Bill
Quick and “Hank” Loftin will have the
shortstop job between them. A. P. How-
ard, a sophomore, will*also be a candi-
date for the infield.

In the outfield, two regulars from last
season, Rogers and Morgan, will patrol;
the other outfield berth going to Johnny
Partridge or Ed Armfield.

The battery men have been working

out in the gym since last Wednesday in
an effort to round into shape. Three
hurlers from last year, Harris, Jenkins
and Coble, will probably see a great
deal of mound duty this season. Henry
Cathey, “Lefty” Porter and Jack Sum-
merville will round out the pitchers. Por-
ter the only southpaw among the
pitchers,
The Wildcats will be well fortified be-
hind the plate with Wingtield and Rave-

of the plate with Dixon having the edge.

Spring Football Squad
Ends Season Saturday

Last Monday a large squad of Da-
vidson football candidates entered their
last week of preparation for next year's
tough schedule. For weeks
fifty men have been going through their

Newton and Mckver, .assisted by some

Soon after the start of practice the
large group was divided into two squads,
the Greys and the Reds. ‘These two
teams have opposed each other six times,
with the Greys now holding an advan-
tage of five to one in games won. All
the contests were close, however, none
being decided by a margin greater than
one touchdown.

Thursday the Greys hung up their
fifth victory with a 6-0 win. Paul Pitt-
man skirted the Red flank in the first
period for the only marker. In the
third period the threatetied, but
superior line play by their opponents re-
sisted them.

There were no practices Friday and
Saturday, the coaches having left town
to attend a coaches’ conference.

BLACKWELDER LEADER

Leroy Blackwelder was chosen
by the Wildcat wrestlers to be
their captain in 1936. Leroy, vul-
garly known as “Big 'Un,” is
truly worthy of the honor. He
won every match during the past
season, and didn’t one time
wrestle a man that weighed as lit-
tle or less than he did. That’s no
bad record for a man who has
only been associated with the
game for two years.

Phifer Erwin will succeed Mack Por-
ter as manager of the grappling squad.
This is a job that requires no small
amount of work, and Mack has handled
it in such a way as to merit the hearti-
est congratulations this corner can be-

TENNIS TOURNEY
NOW UNDERWAY

The annual spring varsity tennis tour-
nament got undet way early this week
with over twenty entries. The tourna-
ment, which is held every year for the
purpose of selecting members of the var-
sity tennis team, this year will be run
off under the direction of Ed Garrett,
varsity tennis manager.

The first round of the tournament was
completed on Tuesday. Four men were
seeded in the pairings: 1, Dudley El-
very; 2, Tommy Phifer; 3, Carlysle
Lewis, and 4, Martin Barnett. These
men are veterans of last year's team
and will probably occupy the first four
positions on the team this year. The
other two places will Be filled in accord-
ance with the tournament results and by

assortment of the best teams in North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Flor-
ida, and Virginia. An extensive trip is
scheduled for the spring holidays, when
six players and the manager’ will leave
for an eight-day tour of South Carolina,

FAUSH RUNNERS
SHOWING FORM

With the end of winter sports and
the beginning of the spring sports, the
freshman track team has commenced al-
ready to take form and to promise that
the class of ’38 will be well represented
in this line.

Next Monday the yearlings will for-
sake the well-worn board track and will
begin to re-warm ‘the cinders on Rich-

son will begin at that time and it is
expected that there will be quite a num-
ber of candidates for this year’s fresh-
man team.

Juniors Win Intramural Champ-
ionship By Thrilling Triumph
Over Centennials

Last Friday afternoon the intramural
soccer season was terminated by a
thrilling overtime game which gave the
juniors just time enough to slip two
winning shots through the sophomore
goal.

The game was to decide the champion-
ship in the class tournament between
the centennials and the juniors, since
each had won an equal number of games.
The two teams had met before and had
fought through an extra period to a 1-1
tie. Not until midway through the sec-
ond half of last Friday’s game did either
team show any offense, each playing
more defense, apparently afraid of be-
ing scored on. At the end of the first
extra period, the class of ’36 began to
show the superiority which was to give
them the game. With about two min-
utes to play in the second overtime pe-
riod, a centennial defense. man tapped
the ball out of bounds behind his own
goal line and “Tinkle” Bell, junior flash,
elected to boot the corner kick. The
kick was a beauty, it soared high into
the air and dropped directly in front of
the sophomore goal and Arthur Haake
jumped up to meet it and headed it past
the sophomore goal—the prettiest play
of the game. (a!

Not more than twenty-five seconds
centennial goal and managed to slip an-
other through. The game ended with the

score 2-0 for the third-year men.

For the champions, Bell, Haake and
Eddie Donigan furnished the spark in
the forward line for the winners, while
George Leukel, John McMullen and
Johnny Partridge supplied the backbone
for the defense.

For the losers, Graham, Squires and
Bob Wilson led the attack and Kenneth
Scott, Frank Brown and Kenneth Knorr
shone in the defense. It may be said of
the centennials that they had some good
material and plenty of the fight which
it takes, but lacked’ the organization re-
quired to win.

‘athe tournament was a bit unusual in

that each class played only one game
with each’ one of the other classes, with
the exception of the final playoff. It is
customary for all the teams to at least
have a return game. Despite this one
peculiarity, the tournament created quite
a bit of interest which may cause soccer
to be introduced as a*varsity sport-next
year.

Will Compete In Confer-

FROSH ALSO ENTERED

Barrow, Wicker, And Hardin To
Represent Kittens

With the first outdoor meet slightly
more than two weeks off and the sec-
ond indoor contest coming up this Sat-
urday, the Davidson track and field con-
testants are busily engaged in intensive
practice for the approaching season. A
tentative schedule of meets bids fair to
present the stiffest program a Davidson
track team has faced in years. The in-
adequate length of time for proper prep-
aration necessitates unusually concen-
trated work during the next few weeks,
and the cinderpathmen are losing no time
in getting into shape.

With the horizon considerably dark-
ened by the loss of Captain Fred Mc-
Phail, stellar hurdler, additional weight
has been thrown upon the shoulders of
the remaining men, who have begun in
earnest to take up where last year’s suc-
cessful aggregation left off. Although
no definite training rules have been
adopted as yet, at a meeting of both
varsity and freshman squads held last
Thursday afternoon Captain Pritchett
stressed the importance of beginning
early to get into good physical condi-
tion. A training table was started at
the hotel on the first of this month, and
most of the men are getting their meals
there. Extensive training begins on the
11th, when, the weather permitting, the
entire squad will leave the boards and
work out regularly on Richardson Field.

Encouraged by the excellent perform-
ances of Earl Frazier and John Lee in
the Charlotte indoor meet a week ago
last Monday, Captain Pritchett and
Heath Whittle, the Davidson mentors,
aré spending most of their time working
with those candidates who are not so
sure to be consistent point winners but
in whose hands rests the fate of this
year's team. According to Captain
Pritchett, the success of the team de-
pends largely upon the manner in which
these men deliver. Such men as Parker,
in the hurdles; A. J. Potter and John
Newton, in the weights; Walter Dick-
son, Johnny Pierce, and Fritz Byerly,
sprinters, and Billy Merchant, George
Gullette and Bill Bell, distance runners,
are the ones who must come through in
grand style to give the Wildcats a win-
ning combination.

Davidson will be represented at the
annual Southern Conference Indoor
Games, held at Chapel Hill on Saturday,
by five, and possibly six, men: Frazier,
Parker, and” Dickson, varsity competi-
tors, and Freshmen Wicker and Barrow,
and possibly Hardin. Beeause there is
no mile nor two-mile events in the non-
conference division, Frazier will enter
the half-mile. Parker will run the 60-
yard high hurdles, and Dickson the 60-
yard dash. Barrow and Wicker will com-
pete in the 60-yard high hurdles, and
Barrow and Hardin in the dash. The
limited number of events open to mem-
bers of non-conference teams prevents
Davidson from being represented by: a
larger delegation. ‘

Colleges which are expected to have
entries in the non-conference division
are Richmond, Georgetown, George
Washington, William and Mary, David-
son, and possibly a few others. The
freshmen competition is open to both
Southern Conference teams and out-
siders.
