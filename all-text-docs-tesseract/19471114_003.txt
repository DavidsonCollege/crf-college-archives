Continuous Increase

Prices have increased continuous-
ly since the end of the OPA to a
point where wholesale’ prices are
over 40 per cent higher than this
time last year and 100 per cent
higher than in 1939; retail prices on
the average have risen over 50 per
cent since 1939, 20 per cent.of this
during the last year, Under these
circustaminces, many*a consumer is
hard put to make ends meet. To
meet their difficulties, organized la-
bor has pressed for higher and
higher wages, forcing prices up to
cover their demands and thereby
giving rise to more demands for
wages to pay for high priced goods.
Those who are most severly hit
are the fixed income groups.

What has been the cause of this
continued rise, in prices? Broadly
we may say that production has not
been able to meet the demand for
goods, but the reasons for this
failure are manifold. In many cases,
although we can show an increase
in actual production over any
peacetime year, the demand for
such things as houses, steel, meat,
dairy products and other foods is
greater than ever before. Thus, the
economi¢ forces of supply and de-
mand are operating to force prices
up. In addition, profits have risen
by no small proportion in some
areas, showing a steady increase

stated, however, that things can be
adjusted readily and a stable con-
dition of reasonable prices will en-
sue if no more pressures are added

The recent calling of a special
session of Congress by the Presi-
dent was precipitated by the possi-
bility of additional. pressures, espe-
cially from abroad. The proposed
Marshall plan and the past govern-
ment and business loans to foreign

countries have or will create an ad- |

ditional demand for American
goods, competing with the demand
from our own citizens. Will this
new demand raise prices further to
a dangerous point of inflation—
boom and bust? This is one ques-
tion which bothers Congress in its
decision as to whether or not it
should approve the Marshall plan.
The present Administration has re-
cently brought forth three reports
of an economic nature to answer
this question in part, at least.

The report of Secretary Krug
(Department of Interior) as to the
available resources indicates that
our economy can withstand and

meet the demands made upon it!

both from home and abroad, but
that certain basic commodities will
be insufficient in quantity to meet
the full demand on them, especially
grain, steel and steel products, coal
and fertilizer. Each of these is vital
to production in industry and agri-
culture. Added to the shortages of
certain commodities is the lack of
adequate transportation facilities to
get these and_other goods to the
markets.

jand the adoption of the Marshall
Plan will only fill the gap of al-
ready declining exports, making no

}additional net demand. The Coun- |

, cil of Economic Advisors also pro-
posed certain measures to adjust
the pressures caused by certain
commodities being in short supply.
The report found that “no compre-
hensive control mechanism coni-
| parable in size to that of the war
period will be required.” But. it
urged the setting up or strengthing
or controls where domestic and

adversely: (1) allocation ‘of scarce

materials for domustic use to as-
sure our economy that these ma-
terials will be used where nfost
needed, (2) continued use and
strengthening of export controls,
again, to assure the use of products
domestically when they are needed
here, (3) penalties or premiums ‘to
| discourage hoarding of scarce ma-
| terials, such as grain, so as to
imake all supplies available that can
be had, (4). restrictive measures
against speculation in any com-
modities in short supply so as to
keep the price within reason and
| because speculation “does not serve
fan economically useful function,”
| (3) maintenance of tax revenues at
‘existing high levels, reduction of
tgovernment expenditures and en-
/couragement of individual savings
essary funds to lend
jabroad, and (6) enlargement and

to provide

aggressive use of the power to

control the expansion of credit,
which is adding to the already too
| great demand for goods,
Reduction Necessary

It. is interesting that there is no
suggestion to re-impose any sys-
tem such as the the OPA or OPM;
the above proposals may therefore
find wide support among various
sections of the economy, It is cer-
tain that labor groups and house-
Wives will support any measures
which will decrease price, since
they have been vocal in demanding
the return of many former con-

efficient level when business profits a poet

are realized through high sales
volume at the lowest prices attain-
able through economical operations
and reasonable profit ratios.” An-
other faverable reaction comes
from the president of the National
Meat Industry Council when he
vave his support for parts of the
program in the following words:
“We hope the President

meant price control at the source,
at-the-farm level, and allocation of
vital food commodities... We be-
lieve that would result in’a stifling
of the inflationary spiral, which has
a Strong hold on the food situatien
at the present time ,.. We are be-
hind the President if he will come
before Congiess at the special ses-
sion and ask it for such measures.
Also, we believe that Congress
should not refuse, under pain of
being responsible for a recession or
depression, which will result if
such steps are not taken. This
from an industry which was so
vocal in seeking the removal of
OPA and so confident that the
free movement of prices would re-
sult) in eventual stabilization at a
Prosperous level! In addition, the
steel -industry, only recently an-
nouncing another price rise, has
stated that they have practiced
voluntary allocation (rationing) of
steel to various consumer-pro-
