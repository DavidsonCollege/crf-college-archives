Under the Newton - McEver

However, the Baptists extract-
ed some satisfaction from the
game in that it marked the swan
song for 10 members of the Red
and Black squad. In addition to
Paul Pittman, Swede Johnson,
John Lee, Midge Verble, Baxter
Yarborough, Cole Windham, Fields

Young, Henry Cathey, Wood
Burns, and ‘‘Six’’ Johnston, have
expended their last efforts for
Davidson.

Many. and various were the praises of
individual ‘Cats team.
Baxter Yarborough came through in ex-
pected style. The fact that the
returned punts only 0.7 yards speaks well
for Cathey, Windham, Williams, and a

heros on the

Deac’s

host of other players who are good at
getting down under those punts. Ed Arm-
field's OO yard dash from an interception
on his goal line is all that need be said
about him. Wood Burns did a swell job
at center, Windham and Williams, up to
their usual tricks, essayed a lot of ground
on passes for the team.

Lafferty, we've almost given out
of compliments for him, can best
be described by a quotation taken
from a leading paper. ‘And Laf-
ferty, who has the steam of Honey
Hackney, Cowboy Robertson, Ber-
linski and Crowell Little, will be
pestering Davidson opposition two
more years.”

Coach Newton, questioned the
Washington Duke Hotel prior to the
game, stated that Armfield, Lafferty, Cor-
bin, and Dennis would probably be the
backfield next year. Newton also stated
that he would scout the Army-Navy
game at Philadelphia (last Saturday) in
order to prepare for Navy next fall.

Johnson, and Howard Covington, who
also witnessed the classic, can enlighten

Davidson’s team next year will
have a letterman in every position
with the exception of a center.
Paul Pittman’s will be the hardest
place to fill. ‘Every inch the equal
of Mackorell,” he has entirely
dominated every game this year
and although he has plenty of com-
petent successors, theirs will be a
plenty tough assignment.

Grier Martin and Fred Blythe

The Davidson soccer program is now

and the City of Charlotte. The two with
High Point are already history and the
thers will be played before Christmas.

Oscar Armstrong, Al Bixler, Vance Kes-

team and will play against High Point

be used in any of the other games be-
cause of Big Five and Southern Confer-
ence rules forbidding the playing of any
man in an interconference game unless
he has attended the institution for which
he plays for an entire year prior to the
date of the game.

Four Lettermen Return From Last
Year’s State Championship
Team

Davidson’s mat men have begun their
daily workouts in preparation for the
schedule which begins after the Chirist-
mas holidays. Thirty-odd members are
vieing for the eight places on the varsity
team.

\lthough handicapped by the gradua-
tion of the captain of the 1935 State
Champions, Fort, and Quarterman, Coach
Unger holds hopes ‘of retaining the title.
The coach stated that Fort was the best
wrestler he has seen at Davidson, but
also expressed confidence in Blackwelder,
this year’s captain. Coach Unger believes
that with more experience Blackwelder
may become as expert as last year’s cap-
tain,

Four letter men are back: Hodgins, in
the 175 pound class, Blackwelder, in the
165 pound class, Owen in the 145 pound
class, and Parker, in the 135 pound class.
With these men as a foundation, Coach
Unger hopes to build up a team which
will repeat last year’s performance. He
is fairly confident that this can be done if
men for the heavyweight and 155 pound
class can be developed, who will win at
least one half ‘of their matches.

As Coach Unger has been busy with the
football team, the workouts have been
under the direction of the four members
of last year’s team. The squad has been
practicing every afternoon in the gym.
This week the squad will be cut and a
chart of the men and their weights will
be posted.

Phifer Erwin is the senior manager of
the wrestling team.

For the first time, the freshmen will
have a wrestling team. This will strength-
en next year's team considerably, as
the men coming up will have more train-
ing and expertence--————————~

The following freshmen are working
out daily under the supervision of Parks
Harrison. Telford (118), MelIntyre

Graves (135), Walker (145), Woodward
(145), Bentiéld (155), Parham (155),
Ellis (165), Long (155), Friend (155),
and Latimer (145).

The ‘tentative schedule for the fresh-
men is as follows: Winston-Salem “Y”,
Barium Springs, Greensboro High, High
Point High. The definite dates for these
meets have not as yet. been set due
to the fact that the varsity basketball and

Phi Delts Nose Out SAE’s As
Pikas Trounce Phi Gams
in Opening Games

In the opening contests of the inter-
fraternity volleyball competition, the Phi
Delts the SAE's

games, and the Pikas decisively trounced

nosed out in three

the Phi Gams.

In their game against the SAE’s, the
Phi Delts came from behind in the last
few minutes with a determined rush and
finally won out. In the first game bril-
liant net rallies and frequent errors by
their opponents gave the Phi Delts ‘an
early lead of one game.

In the second game the SAE’s seemed
to find new life, and they dominated the
play throughout the game, winning it.
In the deciding game, with the lead see-
sawing, the SAE’s pulled ahead 19-18
with the ball in their possession, and vic-
tory seemed within their grasp. How-
ever, the serve was a fault, and the Phi
Delts rushed across the necessary three
points to win. Jack Lee, Bill Boyd, Buddy
Rainey, and Ralph McClelland stood out
for the winners; George Matthis, Mark
Cauble, Buddy Newton, Holk Robinson,
and Neill Whitlock starred for the
losers.

The Pikas found the going tough all
the way, but their accurate passing and
“killing” never left much doubt as to
the final outcome. The Pikas got going
in fine shape from the first few points,
and although. the, Phi Gams showed more
team-play, the superior height and ex-
perience slowly but surely pulled the
Pikas to the front. In the second game,
the Phi Gams showed signs of tieing the
score, but the Pikas asserted their su-
periority and closed the contest in two
straight games. For the Phi Gams, Law-
rence- Reid and Bill Kiesewetter domi-
nated the play; while Sam Milton, Bull
Durham, Walt Dixon and Billy Archer
led the Pikas to victory.

Freshman Basketeers to Meet Paw
Creek in First Contest of
Season

The freshman basketball squad of thir-

ty will be narrowed down to fifteen for
the first game December 10. The ‘Wild-
kittens will soon be selected for the
meeting with Paw Creek, state cham-
pions and invariably a strong team.

- Action in class games has pointed out
several potential first string men for the
yearling quintet. The scrimmages held
during practice every evening will also
determine the freshman varsity. Jack
and Ned Iverson, both six-footers, will
form the nucleus of the team with Lee
at center and Iverson playing center or
forward. John Tice, Grant Johnson, J. D.
Hicks, N. B. McCulloch, H. Mauney, and
N. B,

for forward positions. W. B. Gaw, J. H.

Edgerton are leading contestants
Mauney, and S. M. Hemphill may play
as guards,

Others that are trying for recognition
are Tom Bettis, Perry Sloan, Frank Wil-
lingham, Locke White, Tom Hackney,
Nesbitt Elmore, Marion Lanier, M, H:
Alcorn, T. J. Turner, Allen Steele, Bill
Boyd, Cage Brewer, B. Dick
Taylor, C. W. Sample, Horace McCall,
and Stitt Robinson.

Brown,

“Chet” Chapman has taken over the
coaching of the freshman team from
Grier Martin, who has been the Wild-
kitten mentor for several years past.

Balls Creek High School will meet
the Wildkittens December 16, and Paw
Creek will play a return engagement. The
tentative schedule after the winter holi-
days includes Belmont Abbey (2), Win-
gate (2), (2), Wofford (2),
State (2), and Wake Forest (2).

Dick Johnson Gets Unanimous
Approval of Scribes as Out-
standing Guard

MANY CHOOSE PITTMAN

“Six’’? Johnston and Co-captain
Cathey Also Rank High

King Football has run his course ex-
cept for a few games here and there and
the annual Bowl games. Now the mania
for selecting mythical all-star teams has
descended on the sport scribes, and each
of them is racking his brain in the weed-
ing-out process tojdetermine the final se-
lections. The All-State teams have been
picked by different editors, and, as there
were many differences of selection, here
are a few of the more important picks:

Probably the most authentic selection

to date was published by the All-State
Board, composed of the leading sports
editors throughout the state. To over-
come the difference of opinion, each was
required to submit his choice of a first
and a second team. A vote for the first
team counted two points and selection on
a second team counted one point; thus
the players were ranked in proportion,
and in accordance with, the number of
points they polled. The first official team
was composed of the following:
Ends—West (Duke) and Bershak (Car-
olina); Tackles—
Evins (Carolina)
and Durner
(Duke) ; Guards—
Dick Johnson (Da-
vidson) and Jim
Johnston (Duke) ;
Center—S a bo 1
(N. C. State);
Backs—Parker
(Duke), Jackson
(Carolina), Kitch-
in (Wake Forest),
and Hutchins
(Carolina). ‘The second team is as fol-
lows: Ends—Buck (Carolina) and Cara
(N. C. State); Tackles—Farrar (N. C.
State) and Trimpey (Carolina) ; Guards
—Daniels (Carolina) and Worth (N. C.
State); Center —Henemier (Duke) ;
Backs—Pittman (Davidson), Alexander
(Duke), Bardes (N. C. State), and
Ward (Duke). Co-captain Henry Cathey
and “Six”? Johnston, two
tackles, were included in the group re-
ceiving honorable mention.
Chauncey Durden, sports commentor
for the Charlotte News, differed with
the Board’s pick, and he picked David-
son’s Paul Pittman for one of the first-
string backfield berths. His backfield line-
up would consist of Parker, Jackson,
Pittman, and “Hump” Snyder (Carolina).
In picking Pittman, he said the final
reason for this choice was the way Paul
