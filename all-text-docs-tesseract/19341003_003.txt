Faculty Advisors And New
Pan-Hellenic Council Meet

A. Two-Year Extension Is Granted
To All Fraternities On
House Rent

SPEECHES ARE HEARD

Two Dances Are Planned For
Mid-October

The Pan-Hellenic Council held
first meeting of the year with the Fac-
ulty Advisory Committee and the presi-
dent of each fraternity last Thursday
night. It is the custom to have two such
meetings each semester. The purpose
of these meetings is to enliven the in-
terest and friendly relationship between

its

the faculty and the fraternities. All
problems held mutually by the two
groups are also brought up at these
meetings.

The Council goes on record as being
against the present system of time for
rushing season, since the majority were
opposed to it. However, no definite ac-
tion was taken on this question. It was
decided Thursday night to abandon all
plans for the dance after the Elon game.
In its place, a set of two dances on Fri-
day and Saturday nights, October 19,
20, immediately preceding and following
the Duke game, was planned.

Short talks were given to the group
by each member of the Faculty Advisory
Committee, who are: Mr. F. L. Jackson,
chairman, Prof. A. Currie, Dr. J. M. Me-
Connell, and Mr. F. W. Hengeveld. In
these talks the work of last. year’s
Council was praised, and hope was ex-
pressed that the new Pan-Hellenic
Council would do as well. ‘The position
of the Faculty Committee was empha-
sized as being advisory rather than ex-
ecutive. ‘The committee wishes to stand
as an intermediary between the fraterni-
ties and the college and faculty as a
whole. Moreover, Mr. Jackson gave the
good news of a two year extension of the
rent on the fraternity houses at 6 per cent
of their valuation instead of the expected
raise to 8 per cent.

B. 1 Rose Is Appointed

sition of business manager of the Annual,

pointment to West Point.

managers of last year which consisted of
Edwin G. Holt and Walter Sprunt. The
new manager stated that as yet, no defi-
nite plans have been made for the func-
tions of the business staff but that Dun-
bar and Daniel of Raleigh, N. C., have
heen selected as photographers for this
year. ‘They have already taken -some
pictures and will be back on the campus
from time to time during this year’s

Second Time In Eu Hall

The Eumenean Literary Society met
for their weekly meeting last night,
October 2nd, in the Eu Hall. Ed Hodge,
president, for this year, presided.

The dissertation of the evening was a
debate on “Resolved that the Quarter
System Should Be Used at Davidson
Instead of the Present Semester Sys-
tem.” J. D. Allen and E. F. Horine
took the affirmative, while J. A. C.
Andrews and C. White argued for the
negative. The subject proved a most
interesting one, many contributions com-
ing from open forum.

U. S. Army Band To Play
“O Davidson” Over Radio

“O Davidson”’ will be broadcast
Friday, October 5, at 4:30 E. S. T.,
on Columbia networks by the U.
S. Army Band. Mr. Ralph K. Os-
trom, solo cornetist of the band,
stated that he was very glad to do
this and that he would do any
other possible favor for Davidson
College. This is a result of the
effort of Mr. Pfohl in sending
band arrangements of ‘“‘O David-
son” to the major bands of the
country.

Shields, a former Davidson stu-
dent, has made a great appeal
with popular orchestras in recent
years. It has been played fre-
quently by Fred Waring, Emerson
Gill, Tommy Tucker, and Oliver
Naylor over national networks

The College Band, which showed it-

musicians, there still is need for more
