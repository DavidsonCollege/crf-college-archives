Carolina Concert Club Presents Fine
Musical*Program Before Large Crowd

Misses Nettie Allison, Christine Smith, and Grace Kohn Render Beautiful

Vocal Selections.

Miss Nan Gordon Delights Audience With

Violin Solos

Playing to a large audience in Shearer Hall last Monday evening, the

lina Concert Club presented one of the

has ever been given at Davidson.

This
female voices, and a violinist, with Mrs.
accompanist, held in rapt attention for n

posed of music-lovers from many miles

The first number on the program was the
“Bandit Song,” from Ernani by Verdi. This
selection was rendered by the 10 men com-
prising the male personnel of the club, and
was full of spirit and fire from beginning to
end. As an encore they sang ‘Music When
Soft Voices Die,” by Errick, which, in its
soft and dreamy quality, contrasted strongly
with the song that preceded it.

Next Miss Nettie Allison sang “Oh, Bird
of Love Divine,” by Wood, and delighted
everyone with the purity of tone and range
of her voice. As an encore Miss Allison

‘sang “A Lesson With a Fan.” This lesson

she demonstrated so bhewitchingly that the
audience called her back for
core, for which she sang@*Confession.”

The third number on the program consist-
ed of*two from Verdi's Rigoletto, “Hush in
Silence” and “Unto a Lonely Abode.” These
two songs were sung by the same group of

a second en-

men that gave the first selection and proved ;

equally pleasing. As the audience would not
he satisfied with these two songs, they re-
turned and song “The Old Road,” by Scott.

Miss Christine Smith then sang Clarke's
“Oh, Little Rose of May” in a most pleas-
ing manner. As an encore Miss Smith sang
“A Sapphic Ode.” by Brahm.

The next selection, and perhaps to some
the most pleasing of the program, was the
“Misereri” from IH Trovatore. Miss Kohn
sang the soprano, the true and broken-heart-
ed sweetheart, with Mr, im-
prisoned lover. The rest of the men of the
club composed a chanting choir of priests
and formed with their deep and ceaseless
“Te Deum” and dark background

Sunday evening.

Mr. Glasgow will be remembered by the
upper classmen by his forceful talk on A
Life of Purpose which he delivered before
the “Y" last spring. Although a graduate

Washington and Lee, Mr. Glasgow has
always been a friend of Davidson, and as a
friend he was asked to come before the “Y.”

“New ideals, new opportunities, are open
to you as individuals that never were yours
before. Now is the time, in the formative
period of your life, to watch your step.”

Honor Store Opens Its

New Phase of the “ionor System

STORE LOCATED IN WATTS

C. A. Young Gradually Increases

The Davidson College Honor Store, run
students and for the benefit of students,
opened for business in the basement of Watts
dormitory, on Monday, October 15th. C. A.
| Young, ‘24, is the manager of the store, and
he has high hopes for its success because of
this confidence in the backing it will receive
from the student body.

The feature is found in the
honor system of paying for what is bought.
There is absolutely no place for credit in the
‘scheme. It is similar to the famous Piggly
Wiggly stores in that you get what you want
from the stocked shelves, but it is different
in the paying method. In the Honor Store

Kluttz began‘his talk by showing the

in Japan and asking that they return it. He
said there were two important observations

one was that the antagonistic attitude of Ja- |

pan toward the United States was changing
to one of friendship, indirectly, because of
the increasing influence of Christianity in
Japan and, directly, because of the invaluable |
aid America rendered to the Japanese in the
terrible conditions resulting from the earth-
quake, The second was that what the world
