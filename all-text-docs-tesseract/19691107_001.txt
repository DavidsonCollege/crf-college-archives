Board Of Trustees Favors Coed Swap,
Holds Athletic Policy Until Year’s End

The Board of Trustees is-
sued a statement at their
meeting last Friday guaran-
teeing that all athletic pol-
icy arrangements already in
effect would remain in effect
at least through this year.

The delay of consideration
on proposals stemming from
the report of the Commission
on Intercollegiate Athletics
until the special: January 9
meeting was given as a rea-
son for the action.

A fee increase for next
year totaling $225. was pas-
sed. Fees will jump from
$2,495 to $2,720.

The trustees approved in
principal the proposal for the
Eight-College Exchange Pro-
gram, which may go into
effect next fall.

Under this arrangement,

oN

students from any one of
the eight colleges could spend
a tepm or a year at any one
of the other colleges.

The colleges participating
are Hollins, Sweet Briar,
Randolph-Macon Woman's

College, Mary Baldwin,
Hampden-Sydney, Randolph
Macon College, Washington

and Lee, and Davidson.

President Spencer said that
this arrangement would not
preclude exchanges with
other colleges. He also in-
dicated that the housing of
women at Davidson would be
a major problem.

Action on the proposed re-

whe isle ae of the trustees

was deferred pending fur-
ther study. A special-eommit-
tee was appointed to review
the matter.

Park Problems
Studied By CRC

The Davidson Committee
on Community Relations, for-
merly The Mayor's Commit-
tee on Community Relations,
agreed to study the needs of
the community for parks and
recreational facilities at an
open meeting Tuesday.

A report as to costs and
feasible locations will be
made to the Town Council
in time for inclusion in the
budget next April.

The North iecklenburg
YMCA: will conduct a mem-
bership drive next week, ac-
cording to Robert Stone.

Queens

Gets Lake
Property

Queens College has pur-
“chased 84 acres of prime
land on the eastern shores
of Lake Norman
County for future recreation-
al use according to C. P.
Street, chairman of Queens’
board of trustees.

Funds for the purchase of
the land were obtained from
contributions make by Irwin
Belk of Charlotte, president
of Belk Enterprises, Inc., and
a Queens trustee.

“Queens College is pleased
to acquire this land and grate-
ful for Mr. Belk’s assistance,”
Street said. ‘This property
will be of tremendous im-
portance in the college's
long-range planning of rec-
reational and other pro-
grams,’

The tract of land faces the
Davidson Lake Campus and
is 2% miles“west of U. S.
Highway 21. The property in-
cludes waterfront and wood-
land acreage and is about
25 miles from the Queens
campus,

and childrén’s ($20) classifi-
cations. “Any program fee
paid will count toward a
membership,’ he said.

At this time, the North
Mecklenburg YMCA has col-
lected over $3000 in donations
during a summer canvass.
This initial funding was neces-
sary to start the programs
in the fall. The YMCA needs
$9000 to Se a_ chapter

James Rastova: director of
the Piedmont Area Develop-
ment «Association, reported
that the commiunity center
had been renovated over the
summer and that the new
day care center opened Tues-
day.

The Committee on Com-
munity Relations was made
a formal. part of the town
government last spring, but

“Around the World in 80
Cups of Coffee’’ continued its
world overview with a pro-
gram on-Australia, presented
by Alan Wheen on November
5 in the Morrison Room of the
college union.

Much of the talk dealt with
facts which could be gleaned
from any reputable almanac
— such as Australia’s geog-
raphy, climate, and resour-
ces. However, on many of
these otherwise dry areas,
Wheen shed personal light;
and some of the facts, though
relatively useless, were quite
provocative. Did you know
that one of Australia’s most
thriving industries is the ba-
nana industry?

The informal vein of the
session lent itself to an in-

formal presentation of the
material. Such problems as
the Vietnamese War, the
draft, and the price of T-
bone steak found their way
into the program.

Perhaps, too, there was
Some propaganda value for
this program. The’ picture
of Australian prosperity, the
beauty af their cities, the
lack of overpopulation, and
the liberal Australian draft
law certainly enticed many
of the listeners to fall under
the spell of the ‘‘Land Down
Under.”

On the other hand, Wheen
presented some of the less
desirable aspects of Austra-
lia, that the immigration
policy of Australia is essen-
tially white — oriented, and
that there is a lack of women
in the country.

SPENCER COMMISSION REPORTS

A quick turn of the page will reveal that
this is no normal issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN.

On pages two through six of this week’s is-
sue we are presenting the abridged editions of
the five Spencer Commission Reports.

THE DAVIDSONIAN in cooperation with the
College News Bureau is publishing these five
advisory reports at this time to allow the maxi-
mum amount of discussion among students, fac-:
ulty, alumni, trustees and friends of Davidson
about the major problems facing the school.

It is important to note that these
have no legislative authority; they are advisory
only, made to the President at his request. On
the basis of these reports~he will make recom-
mendations to the trustees at a special meeting
this winter and subsequent meetings if necessary.

Because the total reports and appendices
constitute several hundred pages, we are eons
ing abridged versions of each report. Fu
are available in the Reserve Reading Room of the

too narrowly on the Western
world, and did not adequately
cover the cultures under
which the majority of the
world’s population lives.

The Blue Sky Sub-commit-
tee on Non-western Studies
therefore decided to start a
program focusing on South
Asia.

This decision took account
of the fact that the college
did not have the funds to
bring in specialists on all
parts of the non-Western
world, but could gain more
by concentrating on one area
— South Asia, including In-
dia and Pakistan.

According to Gaige, several
considerations were impor-

tant in the decision to choose ’

this area.

First, India and Pakistan
are very important elements
in American’ policy in Asia

India receives more eco-
nomic aid than any other
country in the world. Also,
the South Asian area, includ-
ing Ceylon and ‘Nepal, is
larger than Europe and holds
20, percent of the world’s
population.

Second, there were already
several people on the David-
son staff with South Asian
backgrounds. Professor <Ab-
ernethy teached a course in
comparative South Asian re-
ligions; Professor Ratliff has
had much experience in Pak-
istan, Dr. MacCormac did
graduate work in Indian phil-
and two members of
the faculty, Professors Lam-
mers and French, have San-
skrit backgrounds.

Third, this portion of the
world experienced British

day speaks English quite well,
which. would help in a Jun
ior Year Abroad program, if
such could be. set up with
India.

Fourth, India is an open
society, the most populous
democracy in the world, and
thus one of the few countries
in the non-Western world in
which Davidson could set up
an institutional background
much like what is now pre-
sent with Marburg in Ger-
and Montpelier in
France.

After making this decision,
Davidson approached Gaig«
to help coordinate the setting
up of-this interdepartmenta!
program.

Gaige, who received h
bachelor’s degree from Ob«
lin College and a Mastei
degree from Brown Unive:
sity, is: currently completir
his doctoral dissertation

ing and researching in Nepal,

Berkeley. His background is

they will not be in effect
for another year or two; at
the earliest.

Besides Abernethy’s com
parative religions course, the
college presently offers Po-
litical Science 170, ‘‘Interna-
tional Politigs in South Asia,”
taught by Prefessor Gaige in
the Winter term.

In the spring term, a course
will be offered on the modern
history of India, dealing with
the growth of nationalism
and the movement toward in-
dependence under such lea-
ders as Gandhi and Nehru.

The Educational

vision of the
requirements

Breaking the silence of sev-
eral closed sessions in the
past three weeks, the com-
mittee has released a three-
page statement which would
modify several provisions of
the area program,

If the proposal is accepted
by the faculty, the immedi-

present area

at Davidson, Gaige
mented, “is to introduce to
the college community as a
whole something about the
South Asian culture, back-
ground and problems.”

In this respect, he spon-
sored this fall a series of
seminars where the faculty
and their wives could attend
meetings where they could
learn about the history, cul-
ture, and current problems
of the South Asian region.

Policy
Committee has issued a_re-
port calling for a major re-

ate result would be to reduce
the pressure on the Sopho-
more class by requiring that
only one area exam be
passed for entrance into the
junior year.

Basically the — proposal
would limit the area require-
ments to three area examin-
nations which must be passed
before the senior year, Al-
ternatives may be substitu-
ted in place ‘of two exami-
nations in the form of a
course or a special project,
depending upon the options
for each class. ‘

Each freshman would have
the option of taking an area
exam or enrolling in a non-
credit course on a_pass-fail
basis:

Each sophomore would be
required to. pass one. area
examination, with no option
provided.

Each junior would have the
choice between passing an-
other area examination or en-
gaging in a special project.
This project must be approv-
ed by an overseer who will
grade it on the basis of
satisfactory or unsatisfactory
work,

The proposal contains other
special provisions. Students
participating in the foreign
exchange program their jun-
ior year may arrange a spec-
ial project to be done while
they are away. :

Furthermore, no examina-

tions or their alternatives
can be in the area of the
major of a student. If a stu-

dent. changes his major, the
requirement in the field of
the former major must be
Satisfied.

~ course

The proposal also provides
for changes in the examina-
tion questions and thus in
the suggested bibliographies
for each area.

These changes would ac-
comodate a program that em-
phasizes a broad understand-
ing rather than a detailed
knowledge of the area,

The student can use either
option or a combitnation—of
both approaches in taking the
examination in that particu.
lar area, Whichever option he
chooses, the student must
State what he has learned
from his reading.

Since the proposal has been
presented during the 1969-'70
academic year, its provisions
would not go into full effect
until next year.

The present types of exami-
nations would still be used
this year, and no alternative
can be offered to
freshmen in the spring. Any
area examinations already
passed are valid under the
proposal.

Regardless, all present
freshmen and sophomores
would be required to pass
three area examinations or
their alternatives.

The provisions of the pro-
posal are, prefaced by a
statement of purpose of the
area program. The studies
are designed to expose the

student to broad ‘areas of
knowledge through ‘a cre-
ative and imaginative’ ex-

ploration of new areas of stu-
dy largely upon his own ini-
tiative.”’

The faculty is scheduled

to meet next Tuesday to con-
sider the committee report.
