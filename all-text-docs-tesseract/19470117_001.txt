Delta Kappa Club Forms With
12 Charter Members; Free-
man, President
In the early fall oi this year, a
number of Davidson students in-
terested in the formation of an ad-

ditional social ‘fraternity on this
campus met together in an en-
deavor to survey the need for a-
nother such organization and to
decide if such action was appropri-
ate and desirable. After consider-

“able discussion it was decided to
organize for this purpose. The name
“Delta—Kappa—Club” was_selected
as an interim name, being taken
from an earlier group begun in the
spring of 1946, around which the
present group has organized.

With an orginal membership of
twelve members in October, 1946,
steps were taken to stabilize the
organization by inviting other in-
terested persons to join in working
for its aim, and later, by the draw-
ing up of a formal constitution, At
length, a charter membership of
sixteen ratified this document. It
was decided to petition the Faculty
for official recognition as a local
fraternity, petitioning Sigma Chi,
National Social Fraternity. Stated
in the Constitution as a detinite aim
was the bringing to this campus a
chapter of Sigma Chi, Charter
Members signing constitution were
as follows: Robert Freeman, Homer

Zedaker, J. T. Fesperman, Bill
Richard, Rodney Whisnant, Devant
Williams, Spencer Murry, R. 3.
Dietrich, Buford Goodman, Bill

Miller, Carl Spencer, Bill Crosland,
Charles Morris, Jim Gribben and
David Dixon,

Immediately after ratification of
the Constitution, permanent  of-
ficers for the ensucing team were
elected, as follows: President: Rob-
ert Freeman; Vice-President: De-
vant Williams; Secretary: Homer
Zedaker. Treasurer: Rodney Whis-
nant. Arrangements were effected
with the Scabbard and Blade and
administration of the college to
utilize the Greek Room of Elm Row
as a meeting place, pending the
acquisition of a permanent house.

Favorable response was shown by
Sigma Chi officials to preliminary
negotiations with the Delta Kappa
group concerning the possibility of
the establishment of a ‘chapter of
that fraternity here, and it was de-
cided that immediate steps be taken
to place Davidson College on the
approved list, this being the first
requisite required before a formal
petition could be submitted. Valu-
able assistance was provided in the
person of Dr. Roy B- McKnight,
Grand Praetor for the Province oi
North and South Carolina, with the
result that this institution was plac-
ed on this roster.

Recognition of the Delta Kappa
group was accorded by the Pan
Hellenic council with the granting
of the right to have non-voting
representation there, and Bill Rich-
ard was recently elected to fill that
post,

Until such time as a fraternity
house can ‘be obtained, the Greek
Room will continue in use as a
meeting’ place, and is currently be-
ing furnished for this purpose. The
first function of the group as a
recognized fraternity will take place
at Midwinters, with a banquet on
Saturday night, February eighth.

Present pledges include:  Bili
Clark, Harry Brown, John Carr,
Jim Riddervold, W. A. Hopkins, W.
D. Beatie and Graham Newton,

PHI SOCIETY

At the last meeting of The’
Philanthropic Literary Society
for this semester the following
officers were elected: George
Worth, president; Haywood
Brinegar, vice-president; J. P-
Etheridge, secretary; Joe Stukes,
first critic; Herbert Dimmock,
second critic; Dave Sheppard-
son, first superviser; Herb Meza,
second superviser. The new of-
ficers will serve during the com-
ing semester. Bids for new mem-
bera to the society will probably
be given out at the beginning of
that semester.

Class of ’44
Hit By War

55.8% Lost From Freshman
To Senior Year
World War IL increased the stu-

from freshman to senior
year by 50 per cent. This the
conclusion reached from recent
study of the Class of 1944. Normal-
ly,according to records in the of-
fice of the Registrar, the loss from

dent loss
is

a

freshman to senior year would a
mount to 37 per cent. For the Class
of 1944 the loss was 55.8 per cent.

In the fall of 1940, 228 Freshmen
entered the class of “44. In peace-
time 85 of these would be expected,
from past experience, to fail to
graduate for various reasons, The
United States was not at war dur-
ing the freshman year of this class
but the times were unsettled By
the beginning of the Sophomore
year 46 men had dropped out of
college. The losses in student en-
rollment continued to increase until
only 34 of the 228 men were left to
graduate by the scheduled time.

67 Return

Only 67 of all who left have re-
turned to Davidson College. Of
these, 13 have already graduated
and 54 are now enrofled. From the
228 original matriculates twelve lost
their lives in the war. :

The Class of '44 was selected jor
study as the last-te-enter—Davidson
under peace time conditions. The

percentage of losses for later class-
es, entering after the declaration of
war by the United States and the
establishment of drait regulations,
was undoubtedly larger, although
no detailed study of these has been
made.

Many persons have expressed
surprise at the size of the prescut
student body. Large as it is the
surprising thing is that it isn’t
larger. There are 69 men of the
class of 1944 who might have re-
turned to Davidson but did not.
Assuming a comparable loss for the
classes of each of the four war
years, Davidson is 276 men short of
a “normal” student body.

Student Groups
To Hear Dr. Eddy

Students of Johnson C. Smith
University and Davidson College
are planning a joint meeting on the
Smith campus to hear Dr. Sher-
wood Eddy speak on Saturday,
February 1, at 3:30 p. m.

This student group organized in
November undef the name of Inter-
collegiate Council for Religion in
Life in the Charlotte Area. ‘They
have been meeting together since
that time to promote understanding
between Christian students on the
two campuses, hearing speakers and
entering into discussions together.
The coming meeting will be the
third for the Council.

Initial.organization was under the
leadership of Ed Golden, a David-
son student. He saw the need for a
group to take the place of the
Davidson-Smith Seminar, which
met with success and full coope-
ration from the two student bodies
in, past years, Through his work,
support was secured from members
of the faculty and administration of
both institutions.

Phi Hall was the scene of the
last gathering of these students;
held on Saturday, January 11. A
constitution was adopted and of-
ficers were chosen. George Worth,
of Davidson, was picked for Chair-
man, while James Green, of Smith,
became Vice-Chairman, and Win-
ona Lee, of Smith, Secretary-Treas-
urer.-The-two-—schools_chose__Miles
Wood, of Davidson, and Rollins, of
Smith, as their representatives’ on
the Steering Committee.

Faculty advisors from the two
schodls have been chosen. Dr. Fore-
man and) Prof, Winn represent
Davidson College. Dr. Steele and
Dr. Belton represent Johnson C.
Smith University.

individually.

Jeffries Ready

Dean Hudson's orchestra, which
will provide music for both dances,
is especially noted for its versatility,
according to MacChesney H. Jef-
fries, president of Pan-Hell, Among
featured attractions, are Frances
Colwell, blonde, photogenic torch
singer and composer; an A Capella
choir; instrumental soloists; and
comedy and novelty effects:

Hudson, a native of Lake Worth,
Fla., is a graduate of the University
of Florida, where he was a member
of Kappa Sigma fraternity, a mem-
ber of the swimming and_ track
teams, and head cheerleader. It was
at the university that he organized
his orchestra, which he managed
until 1942, when he entered the
service. As an ROTC reserve of-
ficer, Hudson was a first lieutenant,
serving as a line officer in the in-
fantry. After discharge, Hudson
played trumpet for Tommy Dorsey
until he could reorganize for him-
self, at which time he opened at
the Hotel Lincoln in” New York
City, where he was featured for a
record-breaking seven-month en-
gagement. Since then his theme
song, “Moon Over Miami”, has been
heard at dances at Duke University,
University of Virginia, and N. C.
State, and in numerous more im-
portant engagements. Latest reports
indicate that Hudson is not married.
His father, a trumpeter with John
Sousa’s band, directed the Nor-
wood, Ohio, Symphony Orchestra,
while his mother was a pianist, sing-
er, and arranger, Little Dean's
musical career began when he be-
came a drummer in his father’s 110-
piece harmonica band, which played
at President Hoover's inauguration.

Colwell Ready

Blonde, photogenic Frances Col-
well, affectionately billed as “The
Florida Songbird’, is a charming
feature of the Hudson Orchestra:
Born in Palmetto, Fla., where her
father was chief of police, “the
striking brunette canary’ attended
the University of Florida. In ad-
dition to her singing abilities, and
blonde, photogenic qualities, Miss
Colwell writes songs for the band.
She has turned out, among others,
“You Set Me On Fire” and “You
Led Me Down”, a pair. of torch
songs recorded and featured by
Jimmie Lunceford. Her hobbies are -
cooking and housekeeping. “I like
to do things for my husband”, she
stated. “During time not taken up
by the band, I just stay around the
house with him.” Miss Colwell is
one of few women members of A.
F. of L. local 802 as a composer and
arranger.
