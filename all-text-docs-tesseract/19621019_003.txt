GATS

BY BILL PRIDGEN

A GREAT DAY FOR FOOTBALL

Last Saturday we saw a heavily underdog team fight
its heart out and come within a hair's breadth of dumping
the Southern Conference league leaders to a loss. Anv
one of several narrowly missed passes would have pro-
vided the margin of victory

The scoreboard read. Davidson 7. visitors 7

But this wasn't the whole stor
hours we had witnessed one of the finest football games
we had ever seen. People around us were comparing the
game to the Davidson-VPI contest of two years ago that
was won 9-7. :

For the previous two

William & Mary was reported to have a powerful,
well-balanced squad. And this they did have. But the
‘Cat defense proved that they have n
in the past few weeks, and they were able to contain each
Indian drive at crucial points, allowing only one goal,
which came late in the second quarte: :

There were so many fine defensive plays it is hard |
to point to any one man as a standout. Certainly Tom Ross |
was a tiger on the field. Jim Fuller made some key
tackles, and Tackle Jim Rhyne was looking good until he
sustained a broken leg in the third quarter. Sophomore
Don Hall took his place and did surprisingly well, con-
sidering the fact that this was the first time he had
played in a varsity game.

On offense the 'Cats showed their ability to move:

' the ball. Passing accounted for most of Davidson's gains,

but the ’Cats could grind out short yardage when they
needed to. The highlight of the game came on the Cole-to-
Heckard pass play which covered over 89 yards. Heck-
ard’s catch and run for the score was one of the most
beautiful we have ever seen. Even if Heckard never does
another thing at Davidson, which we’re sure won't be the
case, he will always have a claim to fame among Davidson
football fans.

The most heartening performance seen last Satur-
day was that put in at quarterback by Kent Tucker.
Tucker, who has never received due credit for his four

vears of football at Davidson, proved himself in the Wil-
liam & Mary game. He lead the ’Cat attack well, and was
able to run himself out of trouble in several instances

, where he looked tike he was trapped behind the line of

scrimmage.

If the ‘Cats put in as fine a show against VMI to-
morrow as they did against the Indians last week there is
little doubt in our minds as to who will come out on top.
A team with the spirit and fight that Davidson's foot-

ballers came out with last Saturday doesn’t lose very |

often.
As we walked away from the field after the game we

couldn't help but think of the inscription on the trophy |

presented after the ’Cats 9-7 victory over VPI. “Given in

honor of the game young men who have proved the

— spirit to be a living reality.” That spirit is still
ere.

It was a great game to watch and a great day to be
proud of the fighting Wildcat football team.

AN UNFAIR CUT

We had extra cause to be happy at the great per-
formance made by the whole ’Cat team, because it showed
how utterly ridiculous and unfair the editorial “Is Foot-
ball Christian” was which appeared last week in a mock
issue of the DAVIDSONIAN put out by the Scripts and
Pranks staff.

We did not think this editorial to be humorous in the
least. The boys who play football for Davidson play hard.
They very often are undermanned at certain positions
and are usually matched against tough opponents. In
spite of this, and very often, lack of student support, they
almost always manage to come out with a good record.
And several times in the last few years they have pulled
off extraordinary upsets. The William & Mary game was
almost one of these.

We would suggest that if the author of that editorial
thinks that the Wildcat footballers are “gentlemen”
about football, he should go down to the practice field
and volunteer to be the tackling dummy some afternoon.
This would greatly please many members of the squad.

THE CRYSTAL BALL

If the ‘Cats keep playing ball like they did last Sat-
urday there is little doubt in our minds that they can|

take all of the rest of the teams they meet on their
schedule. The Kadets are tough, sitting on top of the
conference with a 2-0 record, but the 'Cats are tougher.
As we see it the game will be a low scoring contest with
the ’Cat defense able to dig in and hold the VMI offense.
Score—Davidson 14, VMI 7.

Other conference games we see as follows:

Army 28, VPI 7.

West Virginia University 30, George Washington 13.
The Citadel 14, Arkansas State 7.

William & Mary 7, Furman 0.

Richmond 10, Boston U. 6.
