reporters from the Charlotte Observer questioned them.

In his opening remarks, Sena-

vote for Nixon. He condemned
the deterioration of foreign
policy, the mistakes in domes-
tic policy and, in general, the
failures of the Republican ad-
ministration.

He then outlined some of
the proposals which the Dem-

up by ridiculing the Nixon-

Mr. Coira, representing. the

Council Reports On
Petition, Amendments

Student Council President Henry Shue has omg
that 278 men signed the petitions sh-
men from Queens and Woman's College be allowed to

obtain overnight permission for Homecoming, October
22. The requests were sent by Dean John C.

Shue reported that nothing
had been heard from W. C.
However, Queens had already
taken action before the requests
were made. Queens girls may
stay out until one o'clock Fri-
day night and until two o'clock
Saturday night.

“| think the chances of
anything, more coming from
Queens are very doubtful,’

said Shue.

Shue also reported on a con-
ference he had with Dean Bail-
ey, concerning a recent Student
Council proposal that students
be allowed to attend church
off-campus during the Suriday
night vesper services.

In the past students were
allowed to attend church off-
campus. But many students
felt that this was weakening, -
or stretching, the Honor Sys-
tem, and the practice was
stopped dt their request.

Also, Shue reported, if this
were done, it would be hard to
provide a large enough audi-
ence to warrafit good speakers.
Upon learning this the council
amended its previous propos-
al. If adopted, students would
be allowed to attend two off-
campus vesper services per:

our actions during the Suez
crisis or remain within inter-
national law. '

Mr. Coira disagreed, contend-
ing that we could defend Guan-
tanamo and should do so if the
Cuban government attacked the
base.

Later, Senator, Bell con-
tended that the U.S. must be-
gin to lay the groundwork
for a major defeat in the U.
N. He claimed that it is in-
evitable that Red China will
be admitted and that we must
start to prepare for this.

Mr. Coira disagreed and
claimed that any such move

NUMBER FIVE

By RUSSELL SHOWALTER

Davidsonian Managing Editor

The. Interfraternity Council, after two weeks of drafting and discussion, re-
jected the final version of the proposed pledge training regulations by an 11-1 vote
t A unanimous affirmative vote had been pre-
viously decided upon before the proposal was to be submitted to the faculty for

cil and fraternity men as a
whole opposed the institution of
Sophomore Rush.

The original pledge training
proposal was submitted to the
IFC on September 26, by Hans-
ford Epes, Frank Mansell, and
Bob Phillips.

According to the original pro-
posal “the purpose of the
regulations is to. show the Fac-
ulty and Administration that
students are mature enough to
solve their own problems with-
out the enforcement of Sepho
more Rush.”

After Interfraternity Council
approved the original recom-
mendation was presented to
each of the twelve social fra-
ternities for approval and/or
modification.

bate concerned the time that a
fraternity might require of a
pledge. the prohibition of
“stud” running, forced eating,
calisthenics, and required
pledge attendance at intramural
athletic events.

The revised recommendation
passed by the necessary two-
thirds majority and was again
returned to the fraternities for
approval. Each section of the
proposal was discussed and
voted on by each fraternity.

MINOR OBJECTIONS

Although eleven fraternities
favored the proposal, two had
minor objections concerning the
striking out of calisthenics and
the changing of Greek Week

RICHARDSON

Davidsonian Feature Editor

The Davidson College Developmental Reading Lab-
oratory states, in its printed release given to students,
that if is their wish that each student who applies for

training in reading will have as his general goal:

“To

become as able and as diversified a reader as his cap-
abilities, the available facilities, the time limit, and the
instructional program permit.”

Mrs. H. T. Lilfy, Director of
the Developmental Reading
Course, pointed out the proce-
dures used. “We first give the
students taking the course a
survey test to see how they
stand as to rate, comprehension,
and vocabulary.

“instruction is adapted to
the individual needs of the
student. However, = instruc-
tion cannot be perfect be-
cause we have groups. We
explain the rationale of rapid
reading, and use various me-
chanical devices for breaking
the barriers to rapid and ef-
ficient reading.”

As she peinted eut the me-
chanical devices in the class
room, Mrs. Lilly briefly  ex-
plained their uses. “We employ
the tachistiscope, Controlled
Reading —- a new type of pro-
jector for which we have nine
ty-six different films, and three
types of reading pacers

‘After he gets out of the
habit of reading word by word,
the student reads and checks
to see whether this speed is
maintained,’ Mrs. Lilly contin-
ued, indicating a long shelf of
diversified books.

To demonstrate the func-
tioning of the Reading Rate
Controller, Mrs. Lilly placed
a copy of “Readers’ Digest”
in the machine and pressed a
lever. A horizontal panel si-
lently slid down the page.
“As the shutter comes down,
the obiect is to keep ahead of
it,” she said.

“Classes are limited to twelve.
The Developmental Reading
Course is one of the services
of the Student Counseling Of

fice. The program is entirely
voluntary,”’ she continued, “and
