‘Short Takes-

By LEE EICHELBERGER

On their fourth album, R.E.M. have
shown themselves as a consistent, yet
conservative band. While “Lifes Rich.
Pageant” continues to solidify the band’s
already strong track récord, this enjoy-
able album covers no new ground.
“Pageant” continues in the same vein as
“Fables of the Reconstruction” with a
few alterations. The more accessible pro-
duction of Don Geham confirms the sus-
picion that Micheal Stipe’s lyrics make
sense only in Stipe’s odd world. After lis-
tening to songs like “The Flowers of
Guatemala” and “Hyena,” it seems that
R.E.M. are creating, playing, and sing-
ing songs only for the song’s sake rather

. than attempting to make the ‘statement’
their critics would like. Fans argue that
this simple honesty should be aspired to.
However, when a band has the ablity to

combine starkness and mystery into a for- —

mula that touches a universal nerve, their

present efforts appear to be a waste of tal-
ent.

Ric Ocasek

This Side of Paradise

Something is going on in that thin
skull of Ric Ocasek. I could swear that
since “Shake It Up” that he had tumed his
back on the wide world of inspiration and
creativity. However “This Side Of

Paradise” narrowly refutes that claim.

While his second solo album is not a
strong effort overall, it shines with the
promise that the artist who created The
Cars is still alive. The album begins en-
couragingly with “Keep on Laughin’”
which displays Ocasek’s forgotten
songwriting talent as he muses, “you got
you when you want to find it/ you got you
when you can’t define it/ you got to keep
on laughing in the dark/ you got to keep

-on laughing ’till you find that spark.” For

the next two tracks Ric falls into Cars

thoroughfare, but things begin to heat up
again on the enthralling “Look in Your
Eyes” -and the paranoic “Coming: for
You” which ends the side with a boiling
guitar solo. The fun continues With
“Mystery,” but intensifies in the album’s
centerpiece “True Love” where Ocasek
displays an intriguing vulnerability and
tops it off with a beautiful twelve-string
aucoustic solo. But after that, the inten-
sity dissolves into the familiar mediocrity
which distinguished his last three solo
and Cars efforts. In the end, “This Side of
Paradise” disappoints only because Ric
Ocasek teases us with the fine lustre of
his better efforts and fills the spaces with
simplistic banalities.

I would not be surprised to find Game
Theory’s “The Big Shot Chronicles” on

““Chronicles”

Friday, October 10, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Three new albums to enjoy_

this years end top ten iists of many major
music critics. This varied album of fine.
hard pop carries the listener into the bril-
liant vision of singer/songwriter Scott
Miller. His ‘miserable whine’ and cap-
tivating lyrics weave a spell through
every song with mesmerizing -effects.
From the relentless drive of “Make Any -
Vows” (which rings with Beatlesque
guitars) to the encanting rhapsody of
“Reginisraen” and “Erica’s World,”
reverberates with the
echoes of Miller’s imagination. “When
You’re going Northern” chimes with the
uncertainty and frustration of a lost re-
lationship, while “Here It Is Tommor-
row” drives the disenchantment of self-

knowledge home. Although this album

adheres to no strict ‘concept’ its overall
éffect reveals Miller’s artistic personality
through its lush and immeadiate style.
Overall the strength of Miller’s work,
and the album’s stylistic acessability.
make “The Big Shot Chronicles” an
album that anyone can appreciate and
enjoy.
