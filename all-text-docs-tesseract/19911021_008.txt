THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1991

Beyond Birkenstock:

Feeling Frustrated? Join The Birkers.

Having sat through a fair
amount of the confirmation pro-
ceedings of Justice Thomas we,
the Birks, can say without a doubt
that the fiendish beast of cynicism
(not to mention cliché) has once
again re4red its unsightly head; its
application has clearly been uni-
versal and quite deserved.

Was there, or was there not a
pubic hair on that Coke? And if
there was, how did it get there? It
occurs to us that masturbation with
a Coke can could be quite painful
for either sex (now, of course, a
bottle is a different story). And,
just how massive is His Honor‘s
penis anyway? Who, pray, is Long
Dong Silver?

These titillating questions
merely serve as the scarlet letter
that brands this process for what it
is; a giant show trial more suited
for Wapner than the U.S. Congress
(it's no wonder Dustin Hoffman
always needed to watch The
People‘s Court in Rainman).
Unfortunately, nothing that we
could possibly think to say about
Thomas’ hearings could be any:
more pertinent than what has al-
ready been said ad infinitum by
any number of Senators, Congress-
womyn, (kind of looked like they
were auditioning for The Right
Stuff with that group procession
didn‘t it?) and professional pun-
dits who rose to disavow any per-
sonal culpability, all the while
pointing that ever accusing,
crooked, hypocritical finger of
BLAME. Something must be
done!“ they have told us!

The battlecry is plain, if its
motives are not. The undercurrent
that motivated every attack made
by Anita Hill‘s supporters and
every denial made by Thomas‘
legions was, and continues to be, a
vast and all encompassing frustra-
tion that everyone feels but pre-
cious few articulate. .Don‘t say
you haven‘t felt it. Haven‘t you
ever wondered why lawmakers
who make a hundred thousand plus
dollars a year seem to have plenty
of time to bounce a few checks and
stiff the dining room for the lunch
tab but, nevertheless, don‘t seem
to have the time or expertise to,

say ... figure out a way to effec-
tively spend the 1.3 trillion dollars
a year in taxes they take from us?

Perhaps you think a hundred
thousand dollars a

Certainly Justice Thomas must
have felt it; his nomination process
couldn‘t have been more ridicu-
lous if it were conducted on the

hyphenated origination, recall that
blacks/African-Americans con-
sider theniselves to have been hy-
phenated with, and defined by their

race for generations

year is a reasonable

salary for the legisla-
tors of the only super-
power extant on this
planet, and maybe it
is. After all, how
much more could they
make if they had to go
out and apply for a
job? Were we the boss
of a Fortune 500 cor-
poration, (which we
one day might be) we
would think twice
about hiring someone
who can‘t balance a
budget and won‘tpick

by bigotry and mal-
ice. By changing the
semantics of self-
knowledge, they be-
gin to control self-de-
termination, a free-
dom long held in our
country but seldom
protected equally or
distributed evenly.
For a man or woman
who marched with
King to watch as the
second black ever
accorded a seat on the
Supreme Court sails
through confirmation

up the tab fora burger
once ina while. Ac-
tually, there are compelling rea-
sons why budgets don‘t get bal-
anced. Ask your Political Science
professors. Really,ask them.
Theanswer you'll probably get
is something along the lines of. . .
it's too complex a question to re-
duce to populist slogans and easy
recrimination. The diffused power
in Congress, played against a
minority party in the White House,
coupled with constituent demands
and, of course, the omnipresent
need to raise money for reelection
renders these men (and a few
women) of an otherwise intellec-
tual nature completely incapable
of making the money going out
equal the money coming in. Re-
ally, valid reasons. Much too

‘complex for the public attention

span; too involved for a disinter-
ested and disenfranchised voting
population to thoughtfully address.
Leave it to the experts, really.
Unfortunately, nothing ever
actually gets accomplished. And,
believe it or not, ours is one of the
most technically proficient, ana-
lytically subtle, and intellectually
staffed governments in the world.
The people (more Populism) have
left it up to the "experts“ and eve-
rything works fine, doesn‘t it?
Our evident sarcasm reflects
frustration pure and simple.

island of Lilliput. Perhaps you feel
itand perhaps you don‘t. Let‘s try
another scenario. There‘sacertain
feeling that goes along with being
told that you aren‘t able to under-
stand a particular perspective be-
cause you aren‘t ethnically or ra-
cially linked to whatever value
system the speaker might hold.
Again and again, black leaders from
within and without the Thomas
political maelstrom have accused
the fourteen white senators of being

_insensitive“ to the reality of being

_African-American“ in our pres-
ent culture.

Womyn‘s groups, almost with
one protesting voice, have charged
the Judiciary committee with sex-
ism. If only there had been more
female Senators (feminine-Ameri-
cans) on the panel, surely no such
allegation as Anita Hill‘s would
have been allowed to lie dormant
for so long. Can you imagine? It
took both a leak (apparently a fel-
ony) and a media scandal (not yet
a felony, unfortunately) to force
these fourteen men (Masculine
Americans, read spitefully please)
to address the charges of the noble
Anita Hill.

Now reverse the argument and
withdraw the rather delicately
concealed partisan bias. Instead of
mocking the manner of racially

espousing views re-
gressive in the, ex-
treme and dangerous to terribly
fought for and closely held civil
liberties must be wrenching. Re-
call that strict constructionism, long
the Conservative battle cry, would
probably ratify Dred-Scott. His-
tory doesn‘t seem as pleasant to
those trampled by it.

Race is one of the most frus-
trating of all the means we humans
have developed to differentiate one
another because it is, at once,
completely unreasonable and,
seemingly , desperately entrenched.
We have finally been able to leave
itbehind legally. only to find it still
there waiting, hidden and malig-
nant, within us all. Consider then
what it must be like to have a
prominent member of the black
community rise and publicly ac-
cuse you of racism, a charge that
could destroy your career and
which you feel in your heart to be
untrue; frustration.

Or, consider what it must be
like to feel, beyond a shadow of a
doubt, that the Senate Judiciary
Committee of the United States of
America (The Proverbial Melting
Pot) not only does not represent
you in any meaningful sense, but
also harbors certain members
whom you are sure maintain se-
cretly hostile feelings to any con-
cept of political or racial equality

that they might hold with you. You
have no real avenue for redress.
The political institutions to which
you are guaranteed access are not
responsive. It is the tyranny our
founders feared but, nonetheless,
ratified. How could we have come
to this? Again, frustration.

These are merely examples.
There are other pressing concerns
for which people eagerly destroy .
political civility: is abortion the
ability to legally kill your child or
the guaranteed Constitutional right
to privacy? Justice Thomas re-
fused to answer either way. With
a wink to conservatives, who
should probably have known bet-
ter, Thomas blithely admitted that
he had no opinion. He resolved
himself to avoid taking stands on
judicial issues at a young age lest
he taint his precious judgmental
ability for that time of his life when

‘he would join the High Court and
be asked to objectively rule.

Was Thomas following Lin-
coln‘s hallowed advice to keep his
own counsel, or merely following
the considerably more shrewd
advice of paid counsel, some guy
named Duberstein? Was the very
pressing and real question of sex-
ual harassment adequately dealt
with orconveniently marginalized
by "sensational‘ and "unbeliev-
able“ testimony? Was Clarence
Thomas’ character at stake from
the fourth grade onward, or was he
even liable to.answer charges on
which the statute of limitations in
any jurisdiction in the country had
expired nearly nine years ago?

What does itmatter, you might
ask, it‘s only politics. Unfortu-
nately, its not just politics, it‘s the
law and the future as well. Will
we, and can we, allow ourselves to
stay frustrated . . . to continue to
accuse but never to accept blame.
... to speak but never to listen? Or,
will we ever shut up, listen to each
other, form a consensus, attempt'a
solution and, for God‘s sake . . .
give each other benefit of the
doubt?

away. My uncle Hildebrand
worked hard at Davidson before
he left in 1962, but he found it too
constricting. He went to Samoa
“and never came back. I wrote a
song about it, wanna’ hear it, here
it go, “‘had an uncle, went to
Samoa, never came

back...Ayyyyyyy.”

J: I can see how the narrow cur-
riculum made your uncle claustro-
phobic and drove him to a life of
leisure in the balmy-South Seas.

But not.only do we need to
broaden t.¢ curriculum, we also
need to revise the way in which we
study western culture itself.

For instance, the contributions

of Africans to the beginnings of
the highly-touted civilization of
the Greeks are totally ignored by
our professors. And, by the way,
your uncle Hildebrand didn’teven
go here ‘cause they wouldn’t al-
low black students within twenty
miles of this campus in 1962.

A: Excuse me, I meant 1952; 1962
was a bad year. ‘Anyway, I think
I’licall my uncle. He doesn’t have
a telephone, so I'll have to yell
loudly, What are you going todo?

J: I’m going to look your uncle up
inthe old Quips and Cranks ‘cause
I still say he didn’t go here. Get
with you in a couple of weeks.

A: Peace.

object, an event -- oh day and night
when all-convulsed celestial throes
birthed forth a form, The Form,
The Form of the Bizarre -- The
Braves won the pennant! The
Braves won the pennant! Who
screwed up?

But then I realized, humbly,
that this event transcended the
confines of the columnasa literary
form. We need an Epic. Call
Homer. Give him an “A” cap, turn
it backwards, and watch the heads
of Pirates and Twins go flying from _
their shoulders.

I guess I’m just not qualified to
treat the only worthy subjectof the
week. Sol’m afraid, fauning pub-
lic, that Depth! Relevance! must
take this week, with apologies,
regrets and consolation for your
literary loss, off.

their bodies,
Itdescended tremblingly from their
temples and ribs.

The young men floaton their backs,
their white bellies bulge tothe sun,
they do not ask who seizes fast to
them,

They do not know who puffs and
declines with pendant and bending
arch,

They donotthink whom they souse
with spray.

That would make anyone and

My pointis that sex pervades soci-
ety. Certainly, I trivialize Profes-
sor Hill’s accusations, but let me
suggest that there is no way in
which sexual harassment is itself
funny. Not even one. Our goal
should be to recognize where sex
is funny, where itis lust, where itis
love, and where it is wrong,

prove of.) ;
