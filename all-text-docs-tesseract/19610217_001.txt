During this week Cooley
has heard from about two
dozen additional Davidson
students’ who are interested
in participating in future
demonstrations if they should
occur. Originally, several
other students had planned
to take part in the demon-
stration Saturday, but be-
cause it .coincided with the
dance weekend they were not
available.

“It is inconceivable to me
that people would deny such

freedom to anyone,” stated
Cooley, a national officer in

the United Christian Youth

Movement. “I feel that this is
as good a way as any to ex-
press my concern.”

not try to keep them from par-
ticipating in these demonstra-
tions. President D. Grier Mar-
tin stated in Monday's chapel
service, “We do not at present
have any policy against this
type of participation. How-
ever, if there is a violation of
any law, this would be a dif-
ferent mat

insist that they were not
consciously “trying - to. in-
fluence the trustees in their
decision of whether or not to
admit Negro students to Da-
vidson next year. They do
feel that their actions may
be taken as an example of
the sentiment of some of the
student body.

“We weren't just rabble rous-
ing,” stated Franson. “It is our
sincere belief that racial dis-
crimination is not right, and we
wanted to promote some ds-

cussion and thought on the
subject. If the. time comes
again and I am free, I will par-

ticipate again.

tinued. “There have been no
members of the faculty or ad-
ministration who have tried to
influence us.”

“This is not bad publicity

remarked Cooley. “When |

being staged at that time.”

There have been numerous
repercussions on campus both
for and against this action.
Franson has received a letter
from a Charlotte resident whom
he refers to as being “very
fundamentalistic.”

A petition opposing any such
future activities by Davidson
students was circulated Monday
night. It was signed by 243 stu-
dents. However, many students
have praised the action of the

demonstrators and. have ex-
pressed their willingness to
support similar demonstrations
if they arise

Recent Picketing

This week 243. students

‘| Signéd a petition stating their

opposition to Davidson stu-
dents participating in’ stand-in
demonstrations. This petition
was drawn by John DeVreis,
Jim Allen, and Jerry Aber-
nethy. This was an individual
project, and was in no way con-
nected with any fraternity or
group. —

Allen, as spokesman for the
group, said, “We will not at-
tempt to make any general con-
clusions from this poll. We
leave that up to each individ-
ual. We can say only what it
proves to us: (1) That, when
considering the inefficient man-
ner in which the poll was
taken, the results were pleas-
ing to us, as’ conservatives.
(2) That we could get 243 stu-
dents to state their opposition
to the movement, whereas the
opposite faction could manage
only three or four picketers.”

This petition will be sent to
The Charlotte Observer. “We
hope that this petition will. help
show the off-campus DAVID-
SONIAN readers that there are
still quite a few of us who are
not ready to jump on the
Martin Luther King band-
wagon,” Allen commented.

He explained that he thought
that much more had been
printed that argued for the
“radical” movement than for
the conservative viewpoint. He
felt this was due to the fact
that the minority advocating
change always speaks louder
than the majority who are
satisfied with the status quo.

Votes Pass
To Break
Color Line

By DON SAUNDERS

Davidsonian Managing Editor

Davidson's Board of Trus-
tees voted to accept up to
three Congolese as students
here next year. The board’s
action was the result of an
inquiry of the Board of
World Missions of the Pres-
byterian Church, U. S.

According to Dr. J. Me-
Dowell Richards, president of
the Board of Trustees, ‘a good
majority” of the trustees voted!
to admit these students “if
they are able to meet the ad
misison standards of the col
lege.”

The vote came at the trustees’

annual February meeting

Staff members observed that
other southern schools were
liberalizing integration policies,
and that the trend. throughout
the South seemed to be toward
desegregation. Richards was
asked if the board realized this
and was taking any steps. to
bring Davidson's policy into

Arab Pursues Issue
After Uris Departure

Hussein Kame! Selim, head of the Arab Information

Center in Washington, D. C.,

will follow up the formal

Book-of-the-Year program with a special visit to the

campus March 2.

Selim has accepted the invi-
tation to discuss the issues of
Exodus from the point of
view of an Arab. Stipulations
by Leon Uris, the book's
author, and Moshe Leshem,
Israeli consul, prevented Selim
from being a part of the reg-
ular panel program next
Wednesday.

The Arab leader expressed
considerable interest in the
outcome of next week's dis-
cussions and the opportunity
to pursue issves raised or
ignored at that time. He will
speak in chapel Thursday
and will also be available for
other meetings with students.

Born in 1896, Selim was ed-
ucated at the Khedivieh School
and the Higher Training Col-
lege in Cairo. He later com-
pleted undergraduate and grad-
uate -work at Liverpool Univer-
sity in England.

His educational work has
included numerous professor-
ships in history and eco-
nomics, mainly at Cairo Uni-
versity. His latest official
post was as undersecretary

of the Egyptian Ministry of
information. He has also
served in the Egyptian dele-
gation to the United Nations.

books, both in Arabic and Eng-

Selim has written

been Economic History of Mod-
ern Evrope and The Place of

omy.
