Committee Pussyfooting

The Future Campus Housing Committee has
pussvfooted around in attempting to formulate plans
for the construction of future dorms. The delay has
proven costlv.

If the plans had been approved a month ago. the
college could have applied for a loan from the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at a
net interest rate of three percent. Unfortunately for
Davidson. President Nixon announced several davs
ago that he had terminated all such HUD funding.

Now the college must go to the open market to get a
loan where the interest rate will be eight or nine per-
cent. The difference between the rates will probably
cost Davidson several million dollars.

This will inevitably put a heavy strain on the
already overburdened financial situation. It will
make the job of the people in finance and develop-
ment all the more difficult.

Rather than affixing the blame to anv one group. we
would maintain that al] are at least partially respon-
sible. The administration is culpable because. with
the sensitive feelers they have in Washington. they
should have warned the committee long ago of the
possibility of such a HUD freeze. It seems that Mr
Cornell did deliver such a warning to President Spen-
cer last week. but not to the committee. By then it was
too late anyway

The students and faculty are also to blame because
thev should have pushed for more rapid action rather
than in allowing the decision making process to drag
on and on. Both these groups realized the urgency of
the situation. for with no new housing. coed expansion

will have to be drastically curtailed. but did little to.

speed up the recommendation process.

.This committee is by no means alone in its tar-
diness. Last vear’s committee on the finances of
coeducation and this vear’s new Union committee are
two other notable examples where delays in reporting
out a decision occurred.

We would urge all committees to complete their
reports within a reasonable amount of time so that
more problems like the one caused by the Housing
Committee do not occur.

Faculty Evaluation Approved

Affirming that it is a rare and commendable
organization which is willing honestly to devote time
and effort evaluating itself. we laud the Committee on
Professional Affairs for its work in formulating a
systematic. comprehensive method of faculty
evaluation.

The committee is to be complemented both on its
diligence ‘it has met 14 times since the academic year
began) and on its flexibility ‘it solicits discussion and
suggestions leading to revision and improvement).

The history of faculty evaluation at Davidson is at
best nebulous: it will be refreshing to see decisions on
matters so vitally important as appointments. reap-
pointments, terminations. tenure. promotions and
salary increases being made on a more formalized
basis than those which seem to come mvsteriously
‘from the top.”

Along these lines. we would hesitate to support a
plan which does not include the proposed five-man
evaluating committee ‘four faculty members and the
vice president for academic affairs, but instead
places primary responsibility solely in the hands of
the academic vice president and whatever depart-
ment chairmen he chooses.

Most students would contend that their relations
with the faculty play a major role in their lives at
Davidson. If the proposal] eventually becomes part of
the faculty constitution. students will have the op-
portunity for a considerable part in determining the
nature of that faculty, through both formal evaluation
procedures and personal interviews with the
evaluating body.

We hope they do so: we hope they contribute to
shaping the plan now in its formative stages: we hope
they show their early interest by attending the up-
coming open meeting on faculty evaluation.

MILES WARD

Carleton Recites Tale

Of Rural Philosopher

Some people ask me now why
I don't write something more
about old Davidson. Well. I
haven't seen too much go on tor
a while. It’s hard to do battle
with a building and besides I'd
been feeling sick. Went home
for a while to recuperate.

Last Saturday in Chatham I
spent talking to one Carleton
Milis Carleton is kind of a men-
tor spiritual-wise for me Not
that he ever thinks of spirits or
that he ever talks about souls.
But I generally feel a little bet-
ter after hearing what's on his
mind

Carleton runs a store in the
center of Whitmil] Whitmill has
oniv a schoo) there. the Whit-
mill Farm and Normal School.
And it has Mills’ Store. Carleton
selis most evervthing a country
store usually sells He has a big
room to the side full of dirty fur-
niture. lamps. liquor bottles.
Good rubbish which he sells as
antiques.

Fully half the space in this
room is taken up with books He
must have a thousand Really
good books selling for a quarter
or 35 cents Carleton listened to
me talk for a while Heard what
] was thinking about and began
to talk about his half room of
books back there.

“You know. I remember the

‘last fellow from around here

who went off to study all of that
philosophy He used most of
those books back there. Lot of
them stil] have his stamp on the
inside.” ,

Carleton went over to the top
shelf. pulled down a 25 cent text-
book on Anglo-Saxon grammar.
Inside was printed the name
Arnold Morgan.”

Carleton rubbed a little
chewing tobacco off the flvleaf.
rubbed a little juice off his chin
and into his overalls. He spit a
nice sized wet glob over on the
stove and sat back down.

“Now this here Morgan went

off to the University round ‘3¥.
Was a war on though so he
moved over to Richmond.
Seems he didn’t like Charlottes-
ville anyway and wanted to be
nearer some excitement. Old
Morgan found himself a girl
over there and pretty soon there
was more than just a couple ot
Morgans.”

Carleton got back to his sub-
ject. how Morgan did with his
education in philosophy. “Now
old Morgan wasn't one to be
weighted down by any such
problems as wife and family.
He kept on reading those books
and studving that stuff and
before long was back in
Charlottesville.

“Fell in with a high-class
crowd up there in his studies.
Made his wife go to work and he
kept on writing things down on
paper. then throwing them
away.”

I'm sure Carleton Mills is one
of Pittsylvania County's smar-
test men. He tells me he’s read
all the books he sells and he's
probably telling the truth. He
places a tot of importance on
work though. and scholarship
he thinks. should produce
something a person can hold in
his hands.

“Old Morgan kept that stuff

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Students
Marathon

To the Editor:

We were genuinely surprised
upon reading Dr. Bevan's
Statements in the Jan. 26 issue
of THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Although Dr. Bevan has often .

been an elusive figure when it

Than A Penny For My Thoughts, Rather.

up for about six years. By then
there were three little Morgans"
and a pretty pissed-off little
wife. She'd figured this fling
with learning would wind down
after a while. It didn't and now
she stepped in to cut his water
off.”

Carleton stopped for a second
to lean forward and get really
earthy. “You know I never
figured if he was mistreating
her or just ignoring her and
them kids. But for either way
she gave him the low down. Said
get a job and give up this stuff.
Threatened to leave and it
raised a big stink back here
with his family.

“Well. Morgan came back
here with a truck load of books
and five people. He'd decided to
be a farmer. Moved in with his
mother in a big house over near
Ringgold. And was really a
sight.

Morgan's wife sold all his
books to Carleton for $100. He
gave me one Saturday about the
history of Vikings and said to
watch out for all that philosophy
stulf.

“I don't know how they teach
it these days. but you see what it
did for old Morgan. You come
on back now and bring some
more of those college kids with
you. They're pretty nice folks to
talk to.”

Criticize
Semester

comes to personal meetings
with students. we had assumed
that this was the result of his
preoccupation with the in-
terests of the student body. But
his remarks concerning the
FEC’s proposed calendar show
a clear disregard of these in-
terests.

The statement that the new
calendar was devised to ‘‘an-
swer educational needs.
not...the needs of summer
job, taken at face value.
seems to be the statement of a
born aristocrat. Unfortunately.
not all students at this school
are heirs to E. H. Little.

Students do have what might
be called an ‘attention span.”
To expect any person to live ina
16 x 10 foot cubicle and read
profusely in the middle of
nowhere from Jan. 2 to June 3
with only five days as a break
borders on the absurd. The ef-
ficiency of the students cannot
help but be drastically affected
by this marathon semester.

Dr. Bevan should take into ac-
count not only the continuity of
classroom sessions. but the ef-
fects of lengthy terms on
student pertormance.

All in all. the proposed calen-
dar has completely failed to
consider the situations of the
students.

It is time that a decision be
made as to whom Davidson
College is dedicated: those who
pay $3400 per year to come
here. or those who are paid
$20,000 for devising ridiculous
calendars like this one.

We sincerely hope that the
EPC and the FEC will make the
right choice.
