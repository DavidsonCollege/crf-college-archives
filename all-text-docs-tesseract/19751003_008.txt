The Davidson soccer team
challenged two tough ACC
opponents last week, only to
come up on the short end both
times.

The University of North
Carolina came in on Friday
and finally wore the ’Cats
down to win 3-2 in overtime.
Davidson started vey strong-
ly, completely dominating the
action.

“We played about the best
soccer we could for thirty
minutes of the first half,” said
soccer coach Chip Stone. ‘‘We
were passing well, playing
great defense, and we were
very creative on offense.”

Just minutes into the game,
Billy Hawk took a tremendous
pass from Joe Duncan and
knocked it by thé Tar Heel
goalie to put Davidson in

front. About five minutes later
North Carolina tied the score.

Olaf Kampschmidt came up
with the ball in a scramble in
front of the Wildcat goal and
managed to slip it by the
goalie Bob Perz.

The rest of the half was all
Davidson. The ’Cats put tre-
mendous pressure on the Tar
Heel defense, and had many
scoring opportunities. How-

ever, they could capitalize
only once.

“That’s been our problem
all season,”’ said Stone. ‘‘We
seem too concerned
getting off a perfect shot
instead of forcing the action.”’

About halfway through the
period, Paul Schleifer took a
pass from D. C. Augustine
and kicked the ball into the net
for his second goal in as many

Both teams came out strong

took its toll on the Wildcats.

is just a ‘‘warm-up”’ to loosen
them up for the day’s work-
out, which may range up to 15
miles or more.

To cross country co-cap-
tains Bill Cole and Coty
Pinckney, however, running is

much more than getting in ©

those miles.

“Practice is like a social
hour, where you can shoot the
bull and have a good time,”
explained Cole. “You can
escape from all this school
crap.”

“Running enables me to get
away from school and to put
things in perspective.’’
Pinckney commented. ‘‘I can
think out my personal prob-
lems and just burn off extra
energy.”

Many people like to sing
songs to themselves while
running. Pinckney prefers to
“listen to a song as it is
reproduced” in his mind. On
long runs, he enjoys taking in
the scenery, while occasionally
working on a math problem in
his head.

Cole, on the other hand, lets
his mind rest.

“T’ve never really thotght
about what I think about.
Mostly I just try to put my
rnind into limbo,’ he admit-

Agius. it’s fun not to
think about anything.”’

Both Cole and Pinckney
have been running since their
junior high school days.
