The Purpose Of
Education

It is probably not news that private
colleges and universities in the country
are financially endangered; indeed, the
recent growth of corporation plans to as-
sist these institutions points up the dif-
ficulties they face as well as the realiza-
tion that they must be hélped.

Yet it may come as something of a
surprise to learn that the difficulties of
the private schools affect also the tax-
Supported institutions and thus of course
all higher education. Indeed, so important
in the educational structure are the pri-
vate schools that the president of the
oldest state university in America believes
that if a choice had to be made between
the two it would be necessary to save the
private colleges.

This remark was made by Gordon
Gray, President of the University of
North Carolina, in a recent speech in Los
Angeles. Some of the dangers to the
public colleges if the non-tax supported
ones cannot keep abreast of the increasing
college population are, indeed, obvious.
A far greater burden would fal! upon the
State schools and upon the taxpayers. And
the burden, though already great upon
both, will double within the next fifteen
years to a total of five million students. |

There are sounder reasons, though
for the state institutions to support the
cause of the private schools, as Mr. Gray's
does; the state institutions are creatures
of the state and are answerable to the
state in ways that private schools are not.
Thus they are a safeguard for academic
freedom of all schools and they maintain
standards which tax-supported ones, by
their very nature, could never reach
alone.

It is not just the private schools that
are threatened by a lack of funds; it is
the purpose of education itself. That
purpose is to develop minds in an at-
mosphere of free inquiry; it flourishes
where there is independence; it languishes
to the exact extent of government con-
trol.—The Wall Street Journal, 4-5-55.

What Do Americans
Value Most Highly?

Whom do we reward most highly for
services rendered? The. answer to that
question throws some light on the cur-
rent scale of values of American life.
Physicians. head the list. They receive
the largest incomes, and also have had
the largest increase—80 per cent—in
average real incomes in recent years.
Could this have something to do with the
almost universal feeling that doctors’
bills are far too high? It might; and it
could also have something to do with the
physician’s concern about “socialized
medicine.” No other factor is as certain
to speed the coming of socialized medicine
as excessive fees by private practitioners.
Second on the list are lawyers. Then
follow dentists, businessmen, government
employees and_ scientists. Education
stands in seventh place in the income
of college graduates and the ministry in
the eighth. By this rating the American
people give a fairly low valuation to in-
tellectual and spiritual development. A
national publishing house recently took a
full page in The New York Times to give
the facts on salaries of college teachers.
“Our colleges and universities are living
on borrowed time—time borrowed from
underpafa faculty members.” it said. It
pointed out that the average real wages
of industrial workers have increased al-
most by half in the last 14 years. But the

average real salaries of all college and
university faculty members decreased by
nearly 5 per cent between 1940 and 1954.
A study made by the Chicago Theological
Seminary indicates that the average salary
of full-time ministers in the Congregation-
al Christian Churches is $3,484. In other
denominations it would probably be lower.
No wonder the recruiting of teachers and
ministers lags! It all goes back to what
the nation considers important. We are
able to finance education and an adequate
spiritual ministry. But when we prodigal-
ly spend vast sums for liquor, tobacco,
cosmetics and entertainment and grouse
about making the necessary expenditures
for schools and churches, it is time to ask
and give an honest answer to the question:
What do we really want? Do we care for
the mind and spirit, or only for the body?

—The Christian Century, 4-13-55.

Hard Work, No Pay

Now that the danger is past for sus-
picion of self-aggrandizement, we would
like to put in a squib for the editor of
the college newspaper. At the Associated
Collegiate Press Conference in Washing-
ton, D.C., last October we learned to our
amazement that Davidson journalists are
the victims of an unusual situation. They
are among the small number of college
newspapermen in the country who receive
no renumeration whatsoever for the

weekly marathon involved in getting an’

edition to press.

The managing editors, news editors,
sports and feature editors spend from
seven to fifteen hours a week toiling with
the paper. With the managing editors
rests the responsibility of getting the edi-
tion to press. Yet these men achieve noth-
ing but ambition for their work. The edi-
tor spends about 20 hours at the mini-
mum to get a good issue out. The David-
sonian staff has no vacation or weekly
break except on rare occasions, and brings
over 25 Davidsonians to the students
each year.

Payment, even to a small extent, for
the work that these men do would add,
we believe, some incentive to them to do
their jobs well, thereby improving the
quality’ of the paper. We would appreciate
some thought on the matter, though we
realize it is illogical to expect any action
in the near future.

Swan Song

One of the strongest arguments used
against those professors or students who
are “maladjusted” to Davidson is the
argument that Davidson is what it is, and
that if these people do not like it the way
it is they are free to leave. Thus students
who oppose cut system, chapel, R.O.T.C.,
or vespers are put in their place by being
made to understand that they knew what
Davidson would be before they entered it,
and in choosing it they chose these trim-
mings. Thus, also, faculty members and
students who cry out against football sub-
sidization in favor of library appropria-
tions or for an application of the pur-
ported Christian gentleman ethic to racial,
social or even moral problems are accused
of cramming seditious doctrines down in-
nocent little throats, and are asked to re-
turn to Yankeeland if they don’t like it.

Surely the cult of conformity at David-
son is the religion which takes most of
our time—a religion in which individuali-
ty is sin, and in which Christianity as such
becomes “a matter of each person's
heart,” which means, in effect, that if any-
body's Christianity dares seek application
to life, that application should be en-
closed within the shell of mores which
may be described succinctly as Southern,
Anglo-Saxon, and possessed only by God's
chosen gentiles.

It was once said that the real slavery
of Israel in Egypt was that they learned to
endure it. If there were not a few in these
environs who refused to endure the worse
parts of the status quo, Davidson might
well expect to continue in slavery. These
gadflies might be unpopular, for wel! they
deserve to be, refusing to let the minds
about them sleep the sleep of utter cul-
tural and spiritual unconcern.

As a year closes, we offer a sincere
hope that those who follow will choose
what is right above what is popular. Our
confession would be that we throw a near-
unlit torch from failing hands. Our hope
is that those who follow might finally have
guts enough to lift it high.

“It is romantic foolishness to expect
that by his puny efforts man can make a
heaven on earth. But to wear out our
lives in the pursuit of worthy though im-
perfectly attainable ideals is the essence
of human dignity.”—Morris R. Cohen.

The Candidates Speok:

Platforms For Scripts and Pranks

Jim Armistead

Many of you will agree. that in
the past Seripts ‘n Pranks has
measured up well as a college
magazine. With a small circula-
tion and limited material editors
have turned out good issues in
spite of some problems that. they
will always have to cope with.

Some students have had the idea
for the last few years that hu-
morous and se-
rious work
should come out
in different. is-
sues, some have
wanted to get
rid of the seri-
. ousness alto-
gether, and still
others, I sup-
pose, haven't
eared, so long
as a page of
jokes is included each time. But
none of this has been done, and
for good renson. The staff of
Scripts ‘n Pranks, principally the
editor, though responsible first to
the reader, has to think of the
contributor as well. Student writ-
ing, which is not often earth-mov-
ing, still represents the work of
people who try hard and often.
to pen a manuscript that will do
them credit, and hope it will be
read. The staff of course has tu
print what {s available at the time,
and what is worth the space.

There is another thing that I'd
like to bring out. College humor,
found nowhere else, is necessary
to the well-equipped college pub-
lication, so important that it should
cover a sizable portion of each
magazine and even justify one all-
humor issue during the year.
Ideally there should be a variety
of features, cartoons, selected
photographs, and what other
novelties are available, with the
usual verse and prose, serious and
trivial. Practically speaking there
is no sense in predicting what will
be in the magazine next year. That
has to be decided before each issue
is organized. Serving as editor J
would try to realize a well bal-
anced publication from the. avail-
uble material.

Finding the material is the big-
gest problem. I hope that if you
make me next year's editor, you
will take some interest in Scripts
‘n Pranks by reading it, and in
some cases contributing to it.
I will give it what I have of indus-
try and imagination.

In publishing the four issues, or
however many that funds permit,
the editor has first to select what

Writer Hits Shearer

By A. C. STRAND

We wonder how many of the
student body, faculty and admin-
istration realize that over 200 stu-
dents use the facilities of the
Music Department. Two. hundred
students—one fourth of the stu-
dent body—use antiquated Shearer
Hall and what few facilities it can
offer for classes, band and chorus
practice, applied music practice,
and even for dormitory space! Let

‘us state at this point. to avoid mis-

understanding, that we were not
asked by the Music Department to
write an article pleading their
cause, but rather we. sought the
department out in the interest of
the Davidsonian.

One fourth of the student body
pass in and out through the doors
of this wonder of the 1800's quite
frequently, and yet how many in
Davidson are aware that the toilet
facilities for these two hundred
students centers around one single

“head,” to use a colloquial term.

The room in which this “head”
is located is not heated, and we
don't think we need to go into de-
tails as to the probable experiences
derived from it by members of the
music group using it. The nearest
heated toilet facilities are in an-
other building—the YMCA Guest
House—located at a distance of
fifty yards. One might just as well

will be printed, while knocking on
doors to find out what will be
there to print. He has to organize
material into an acceptably attrac-
tive form and walk a tightrope be-
tween an eagerly-read magazine
and the censors. Then comes the
time when he is tempted into
putting out a special issue on one
theme, and that is when such
things as reluctant writers, dead-
lines, and assigned articles, that
ofdinarily belong in delirium tre-
mens, come out to haunt him and
the staff. The production of Slime
tWo years ago is an excellent ex-
ample of what can be done, while
last year’s 3-D issue fell some-
where short. I am convinced that
a theme issue should be attempted
next year if the quality of the
work is not strained, otherwise
I'd rather have a good general
issue,

Above all the things an editor
should remember is the purpose of
his publication. Scripts ‘n Pranks
is for entertainment. Students can
be informed through the news-
paper and have their minds en-
riched by text books, but the col-
lege magazine is, and I hope will
remain, an opportunity to enjoy 2
few minutes of home-grown wit
and maybe some serious efforts
at a worthwhile piece of writing.

Joe Garrison

A well-worn tweed was disgrace-
fully thrown over the back of an
overstuffed armchair. A lazy smoke
ring wreathed the naked light
bulb in the center of the ceiling.
At a des@ in the corner five busy
little men huddled around manu-
scripts, and scribbled memoranda.
A knock at the door summoned a
solitary response. Telegram. “In
Bosonia and Herzegovina more
citizens read Seripts ‘n Pranks than
any other college magazine.”

Our reading audience is obvious-
ly quite diverse. Some, like Egret
Feathers chant
for “Blood, sex,
and sadism.” On
the other hand,
there are some
who merely
wish to see gen-
re scenes of boys
frolicking about
pasture - like
: campii and gar-
wr-=«$ dens filled with

Garrison friendly rivalry.
This situation puts the editor
somewhere between Egret and
Horace G. Harvard, Hl.

Scripts ‘n Pranks is designed to
fill the role of literary-humor

freeze in the one building as to
frigidly walk to another.

The whole story of the shape of
the Music Department could be
summed up in the one phrase,
“The Sadness of Shearer Hall.”
The Music Appreciation class of
some thirty-three students takes
up the largest classroom in Shearer
—and that classroom is bulging
at the seams.

Some of the classrooms have no
blackboards, and lighting is poor
in most of them, especially in the
big rehearsal hall on the second
floor of the building where 100-
watt bulbs without shades cause a
terrific glare.

Another defect in Shearer Hal!
is its inadequacy of space for re-
hearsal. There is one big room,
but the situation of scheduling re-
hearsals gets confused when both
the Male Chorus and the Band need
to rehearse on the same night at
the same time. What is needed are
two rehearsal rooms of adequate
size and with adequate acoustics.

Most men in the Music Depart-
ment give lessons to students and
youngsters of the town—but they
must give these lessons in their
own offices, and while Mr. Plott
is teaching voice, Mr. Satterfield
may have a trombonist at practice,
and in the office in between—that
of Herb Russell—the confusion

magazine. Every spring the Ilit-
erary politicians have debated:
How much literature? How much
humor?

Editor after editor has thrown
down his pen and cried, “I am
tired.” Some 850 students here are
all tired—tired of turning pages
of small-print stories and poems
and tired of being confronted with
adjectives such as “sloppy snow,”
and “sloshy slush,” and had one
take the time to wade in deeper,
he would have ruined his own dis-
position as well as his white bucks.

A college magazine is only as
good as the editor’s devotion to an
idea. My devotion would be con-
centrated on the side of the practi-
eal, but I also would observe high
standards of quality. My complaint
of past years is editorial unaware-
ness of obligation to the student
body. The opportunity to publish
is granted, but I see it with the
stipulation that the editor must
find favor with the students.

This would be my catalogued
policy: 1—I visualize the publica-
tion of four magazines, two humor,
one Niterary, and one combination
—the two humor magazines for
dance weekends, an appropriate
Christmas issue, and a spring lit-
erary issue containing the winner
of the Vereen Bell and Willa Cather
competition. 2—I desire to do away
with the present editorial caucus
in the staff and notify our army
of contributors of both the theme
and deadline for the magazine. 3—
I would change the style of com-
position, for I feel that the clash
between the literary and humor en-
tries has marred the overall effect
of Seripts ‘n Pranks. (I assure you
that the general “appearance” of
the magozine would be a far cry
from any issue you have previous-
ly browsed through.)

In the past, it has been almost
a tradition for the staff of Seripts
‘n Pranks to begin its year with
a silver-tongued generality con-
cerning its intentions for the com-
ing year. There have been few
occasions when these generalities
were not dashed against the wall
of cruel circumstances by the end
of the year. ‘With this dismal fate
in mind I am putting aside all
absolute promises. It would be
absurd to promise. anything for. ao
literary-humor magazine which de-
pends so strongly upon contribu-
tions of its readers. But let me
say this: 1 have some attractive
ideas about content and make-up,
and if I am elected as editor of
Scripts ‘n Pranks, the magazine
will wear a new appearance. This
is in the nature of a promise. It is
the only promise I shall make.

Facilitie
reaches a climax.

Whatever we say for the Music
Department could be said also for
the Fine Arts Department and, in
a sense, the Speech Department,
for these other two departments
also need room of their own if
they are to play the roles they
should in a liberal arts college.

RESTORATION OF
QUADRANGLE

As recently announced by Presi-
dent Cunningham, the Board of
Trustees of the college is now
formulating plans for the restora-
tion of the original quadrangle, to
furnish adequate facilities for the
Music, Speech, and Fine Arts De-
partments. .

Such a building program should
include soundproof offices for the
faculty of the Music Department.
it should allow for expansion of
the Music Appreciation course; it
should contain two rehearsal
studios, one equipped for the band,
the other for the chorus.

As we see it, Davidson must
either initiate such a program or
have, instead of the famous book
brigade, a hammer and nail party,
in which each student takes a
hammer and a nail and does his
part in chipping the old stucco off
the wonder of the 1800's, the incul-
cation of Davidson tradition,
Shearer Hall.

RACKS

IN THE

LOISTER

By GILBERT GRAGG

On Spring, Change, Mauze,

“Holy Joes,”

It would be difficult to see how
anyone could contemplate suicide
in the spring. Not only does nature
put on her finest show (the grass
is still green and occasionally the
air is yellow, but it has rained a
great deal since last April!), but
there is enough growth and change
elsewhere to make us feel that
maybe there is something “new

under the sun” and life is con- .

stantly intriguing for those who
look.
OUTSIDE WORLD

Beyond the narrow confines of
our provincialism this spring
shows many changes—in the pollti-
cal field we see “golden-haired
Eden ascending to the throne of
memory-laden Churchill; the seeth-
ing cauldron of international ten-
sion bubbling over Quemoy and
Matsu and the. Asian-African con-
ference; in medicine the wonder-
ful Salk vaccine indicates more
cancer research; in movies suave
Grace Kelly replacing tempestuous
Marilyn; and perhaps the most
startling evidence of change is the
fact that Anne Lindberg’s Gift
from the See is about to do the
impossible and replace Peale as
number one on the best seller list.
Speaking of “The New Religion”
brings us back home.

OUR OWN BACKYARD

For Davidson the growth asso-
ciated with spring may be sym-
bolized by the “Duke Dog’ whose
new puppies were born before
sympathetic eyes in front. of the
dorm. And the news could not be
better from our spring sports pro-
gram (without subsidization) after
a discouraging basketball season.
One of our greatest changes is the
new Y Constitution which is noth-
ing short of revolutionary when
compared to the minor changes in
the much-publicized Student Coun-
cil constitution! Of course, spring
at Davidson means elections “Da.
vidson style,” and some eager can-
didates even begin speaking to
everyone.

“BLACK FRIDAY”

Some aspiring politicos are
so anxious for victory that their
speeches promise everything but
no more reviews. On “Good Fri-
day” Mr. Mauze reached new
heights in half-truths and “white
lies” which got him enough sup-
porters to be runner-up in the
YMCA race. While not questioning
his sincerity, personal qualifica-
tions, or the good he may have
done it is inconceivable to us how
a rational student could vote for
any candidate who charged UCM
as “forcing-religion down our
throats” (no religious program has
ever been less obviously forced-
when students could disagree with

Easter, Christ

speakers in classroom discussions)
and its leaders as “propagandists.”
Who is not going to a football game
or Spring Frolics because he does
not get a personal invitation? All
know where the Y office is and
that it is always open for those
who want to give unselfishly of
their time to something higher
than themselves.
HYPOCRITES

“At least Mr. Mauze is not a
hypocrite in his speech,” said one
enthusiastic supporter, and it is
certainly true he did not choose
to discuss the kind of Gospel he
would favor being taught in Sun-
day Schools. But are not any of
us who come to a church ‘school
with its emphasis on Christian
scholarship hypocrites when we
spend most of our time seeking
sensual pleasures and waste time?

But what about the orthodox Y
workers who are hypocrites. Of
course, all Christians are of necess-
ity hypoerités who profess to follow
unattainable standards of conduct.
Perhaps this is a good time to re-
member that Christ condemned
sins of the spirit as self-righteous-
ness; pride, envy, ambition, (work
in Y to get cabinet post), and sel-
(ishness even more than sins of
the flesh. We are all guilty of
adultery, cheating, lying, ete... .
in thought if not in deed, and this
is why Christ had to go to the
cross,

TRAGEDY ANDO TRIUMPH

The most unfortunate thing
about religion at Davidson is not
that we have any “Holy Joes” but
none who are°willing to actually
jump off the “deep end” and start
taking “Christianity seriously in
every phase of life. But this would
involve going to the depths of our
existence and great suffering since
to really renounce the world for
the “depth of truth” and to enter
the City of God yould mean a
complete transvaluation of our
present value pattern. Only after
we have all taken the cross upon
ourselves can we expect the black-
ness of sin to turn into a crown
of joy on Easter.

The greatest change spring
brings to Christians is the renewed
realization that this earth is not
our home. It is time to heal the
cleft in the students over the re-
cent election and join together now
and in the future to serve our
‘Risen Lord. The invitation comes
from Christ—the real leader of
our YMCA—and it is open to all
who are willing to explore the
depths of their existence. Perhaps
if we keep talking, thinking, and
writing, maybe someday we might
act as if Christ really did arise—
they say He did you know.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:

Dear Editor:

Gilbert Gragg is waxing wroth
again (Davidsonian, March 11,
1955), over the laxness of the

faculty this time. Who can dispute

him? What alarms me most was
my failure to recognize the gross-
ness that faculty negligence
reached, and I blush to confess it.
How many tithes have I seen pro.
fessors at movie ‘houses, at gala
receptions, or driving idly down
Main Street with their families,
shameless of the spectacle their
frivolity must create! Is there not
one righteous man in Sodom? Can
anything good come out of David.
son? Oh, I have seen them, yes,
seen them all—and knew it not.

How long might we have con-
tinued along the paths of ignorance
had not Gilbert Gragg brought us
face to face. with reality and
opened our eyes to the truth! Yet,
he is merciful to the offenders:

his cup is not bitter which he
would have them to drink. Thus
it remains for us to right this
grievous wrong. Up students, for
reform stands without the gate!
Aha! Then what can we do?
First, the trustees must be edi-
fied; then they can begin to en-
large the faculty. Three Ph. D.’s
for committee work are not
enough. There must be more, many
more, to give students the proper
attention. Let us not rest until
there is a Ph. D. for every stu:
dent; as it is written, “No man
can serve two masters.”
Accordingly I should like to or-
ganize a committee of far-sighted
young men, with Gilbert Grage
chairman, to begin a movement
which will prosper and triumph un-
til we have builded a Davidson
worthy of our respect and the
reverence of our children’s chil
dren. —JI™M ARMISTEAD.
