The Point

CRUSADE TO CHARLOTTE

So we lost to a team we should have beaten Satur-
day. Of course it hurts to lose anytime, but what hurt
just as much was sitting on those splinters called seats
at Hoey cnariotte American Legion Memorial Stadium.
(Whew!

e

After;

And just because you felt down in the dumps after
the ‘Football for Fun Bunch” or the “Filthy Forty,” de-
pending on which side of Coach Bob King’s mouth you
are standing. put their “pro-style” sophomores in action,
you could look across the field at the 10,500 plus empty
seats and muse, “In a hundred years what difference will
it make?”

Perhaps the powers-that-be had reasons to anticipate
a respectable turnout in Charlotte, but once again Char-
lotte showed that the Davidson football team is not the
“Darlings of Dixie” as super-SID John Kilgo has labeled
Driesell’s dribblers.

The game drew 8,300 persons, or just 300 more than
the capacity of Richardson Field, the home of splinterless
seats. Because of the low rent of the Charlotte stadium,
Athletic Director Tom Scott says we made some money,
but we didn’t have to call Wells Fargo to tote it to the

ank,

The absence of spectators on the other side reduced
the effectiveness of the lighting system, giving the effect
of a concrete wall with screaming Baptists painted on the
side. Actually, the only good thing about playing in Char-
lotte last weekend were those Furman majorettes, who
beat anything of that type Davidson could put on the

ield.

Football players reported that the field itself was
not the showplace of Charlotte due to the treadings of
four high school teams the night before.

Scott says Homer Smith wanted to play in Charlotte
in an attempt to attract a wider following. Doubtless there
were people there Saturday who would have not trudged
down I-77 to the Den of the Wildcats to view the game
under typical college football conditions.

The poor attendance could not be blamed on poor
weather or television competition like the ill-fated Carou-
sel Bowl on Thanksgiving Day last year. Scott laid some
of the blame on the large amount of interest in the Caro-
lina-State game. But nevertheless, the main reason only
8,300 persons showed up Saturday was because of the
steady diet of top high school football two nights a week
plus the belief that Davidson football is about as exciting
as the Johnson C. Smith Golden Bulls.

Davidson will have to prove itself and prove itself
again before Charlotte fans will ever realize that college
football does not have to be on the boob tube or played
hundreds of miles away to be good entertainment. They
finally figured it out with basketball and they may even-
tually decide that going to Davidson football games is
more than a pleasant trip to the country when the tele-
vision breaks down.

_ Charlotte basketball fans stayed away from the Col-
iseum after we lost our first game last year, but they
finally returned just in time to see us knock off West
Virginia. If Davidson drew only 300 more than the capac-
ity of Johnston Gym atthe Coliseum, the gym would get
a lot more use than it does now. Why not the same for
football? Charlotte people will come only when they are
sure of having something to talk about at church the next
morning to match the guy who watched “Gunsmoke.”

Let’s stay at home for our home games and be con-
tent to leave sunny Saturday afternoons to watch our
classmates mutilate the nice young men of other institu-
tions. We may not have a parking problem out here like
the big leagues, but at least we won’t be forgotten like
we were in Charlotte. And we won't have to visit the hos-
pital to get the splinters removed from our bottoms.

GLIDEWELL HAULS IN TD TOSS

But Not Enough To Win

Gambles Backfire On ’Cats
As Furman Pulls Out Win

Two late extra point gambles,
engineered by Head Coach Hom-
er Smith, were unsuccessful as
the Purple Paladins of Furman
set back the Wildcats 28-26, in
the Southern Conference game
played Saturday in Charlotte.

Smith had this to say about
his extra point decisions: ‘““We
were playing to win. In the
Southern Conference, where one
team is likely to be unbeaten, a
tie is no good. We took a couple
gambles and lost.”

The first decision came fol-
lowing Kit Thompson's touch-
down ia the fourth quarter. With
the score 21-20 in favor of Fur-
man, Smith elected to try for
the two point conversion. Quar-

tempt was no good and the ‘Cats
still trailed.

With only 1:42 minutes re-
maining in the game, Johnny
Walker carried in another Da-
vidson score. Again Smith de-
cided to try for two. Once more
Poole's pass was unsuccessful
and the Dirty Thirty had to be
content with a momentary 26-21
lead.

The lead was short-lived as a
desperation passing attack was
set in motion by the Purple Pal-
adins. Davidson had not had
time to feel comfortable with its
lead before Furman pushed
across the deciding score. It took
the Paladins only. four sideline

IMAC Expands
Frosh Program

“The freshman intramural ath-
letic program,'’ said IMAC Pres-
ident Jack Sherrill, “has been
expanded to include all nine
sports played by the fraterni-
ties.”

Freshmen have been organ-
ized into five teams on a dormi-
tory basis. In flickerball each
team will play every other team
twice. “We hope that the fra
ternity champion will be able
to play the freshman champion
in each sport,"’ said Sherrill.

After the first week of flick-
erball action, East 1 emerged as
the team to beat.

East I rode the passing tal-
ents of Charles Brockwell for

Wildkittens Kick Off Slate

As Duke Invades Friday

Davidson's Wildkittens launch their most ambitious

Friday against the Imps of Duke University at Richardson Field. Kickoff time is

2:30 p.m.

Coaches Bobby Brown and
Dick Short feel they have ‘the
material to match the schedule
with the largest freshman squad
in the last three years. Brown
said, ‘We are out to break the
tradition of freshman teams just
winning one game. This bunch
won't settle for that.”

Brown has such _ potential
standouts as end-linebacker Mike
Kelly, “Athlete of the Year"’ in
Mecklenburg County last year
while at North High; Neal Dett-
mering, three-sport standout for
Fayetteville, Ga. last year; and
Terry Esterkamp, a me of
the All-Cincinnati, Ohio, defen-
sive team.

Brown said no definite line-ups
have been determined for the
Duke game because ‘‘we have
been practicing everybody at
everything.”

He said, “It will be tough but
we will have to settle on our
starters this weekend so we can
polish everything up next week.”

With about the same number
of squad members as the var-
sity, Brown said the aim of the
freshman team is to let every-
one play as a learning process.
“We are playing to win, but we
want to play so that in a year
everyone can help the varsity
program with the things they
learned here.”

Currently three frosh are en-
gaged in a fierce battle for the
quarterback spot on the team,

Rrown said. They. are Gordon
Slade, Garth Hampton and Ter:
ry Miller. Of the other high
school signal callers on the
team, Dettmering will man a
tight end or play defense, Ken
Crews is working as a defen-
sive halfback and Dave Fisher
is dividing time at wingback
and safety.

In John Zaharov of Richmond,
Va., Brown has a_ heavy-duty
fullback and linebacker, but ia-
juries have plagued his prog-
ress.

Brown is deep in running
backs with speedster Ken Hill,
Glenn Praay, Carl Salter, Joe
Kilpatrick and Cooper Brantley,
who, Brown said, looked very
good in a scrimmage last week.
Working at defensive back is
Whit Morrow, smallest man on
the team at 150 pounds and per-
haps the fastest, Brown added.

At spread end, the frosh will
count on Lynn Himes, 6-3, 185,
and George Hannen, 6-1, 185
pounder from Durham.

Center will be manned by
Mike Culbreth, who played in
the Shrine Bowl in Charlotte
last year, and Bill Gammon
from Reidsville. Guards who
have stood out in practice so
far, Brown said, are David
Branch and Allen Hawkins.

With only four tackles on the
squad, Brown has moved Ester-
kamp, who had been out with
a separated shoulder, to that po-

season in many years next

sition as well as another former
end, Garrell Nicholson. Among
the other tackles Dave Thomp.
son has recovered from an early
injury and is ready, and Joe
Carr of Wilson played in the
Shrine Bow! last year.

On Duke Brown said he knew

little about them, but that Train- |j

er Tom Couch received a letter
asking for 44 beds for the team
from the Duke trainer, and that
one Duke varsity player told a
television announcer that Duke
had one of their best freshman
teams in years.

“We will probably be the un-
derdog, but I think it will be a
great game,” Brown said.

Catlett Becomes
Wildcat Aide

W. Gale Catlett, former as-
sistant cage coach at the Uni-
versity of Richmond, has been
named assistant head coach
here, Head Coach Lefty Drie-
sell announced this week.

Catlett, who replaces Warren
Mitchell who resigned to be-
come head coach at William and
Mary, will assume coaching du-
ties and help with recruiting,
Driesell said, and ‘anything else
to help Davidson win the na-
tional championship some day.”

Tuesday. Early in the first half
Brockwell rolled out around
right end and sprinted 18 yards
into the Cannon end zone. East
added two more touchdowns be.
fore the half on passes to Bill
Cockrill and Edgar Exum.

In the second half Brockwell
and flanker John Tolle contin
ued the attack with scoring aeri-
als to Exum, Frank Gray and
Dale Durham.

A strong defense held Cannon
to two first downs.

Cannon I survived a strong
second half showing by ‘Watts
and won 26-20. Cannon displayed
a strong running and passing at-
tack, led by quarterback Romey
Fisher and Ed Bartle, who
caught three touchdown passes.

Watts trailed 20-6 at the half
but roared back and almost
pulled the game out in the last
half. Bill Traxler caught two
scoring aerials for Watts.

Foglemen Boast Spirit,
Point Toward Big Season

By BOB REID
Assistant Sports Editor

Coach Harry Fogleman this week predicted a “real good season” for his var-
sity soccer team, which he rated ‘as good as we have ever had.”

‘We don’t have any real out:
standing stars this year,” he
said. “But we do have about 18
or 20 very fine ball players who
have more spirit than. I have
ever seen cn a Davidson soccer
team.”

Fogleman was _ especially
pleased with his sophomore play
ers, who he said have been chal-

Mailenging the nine returning let- ~
: termen for the starting positions. |
: “These sophomores have been —

really pushing the lettermen and
stirring up a lot of. competition
on the team, which 1 think is
very good. Some of these new.
comers will be playing a lot of
soceer this season.”

The Foglemen kick off their
season tomorrow against Fur
man on the Paladins’ home field.
Furman launched its season last
Saturday with:a 5-1 loss to
Pfeiffer, a team Fogleman de-
scribed as “‘one of the best in
the state.”

“Pfeiffer has a tough team

with a good defense. Furman )J

must be good or they wouldn‘t
have scored against them.”

The fullback post Js the weak
link this year. Fogleman said.
‘We lost. both fullbacks last year,
and that hurt us badly. Satur-
day we will probably’ start Wil-
Jie Edmonds and Joe Norton
back ‘there, I expect them to do

a good job, but I just don’t have
any depth at that position.”
Fogleman said he plans to
shift center halfback and team
captain George Brown to a de-
fensive role, dropping him deep-
er into the backfield to ‘help off-

-set any possible weakness at

fullback.

Also at halfpack will be sen-
lor letterman Mac Fiddner, Fo-
gleman said he is still undecid-
ed between Harvey Newman,
Geordie Lang and Ben Martin
for the remaining halfback slot.

In the forward line, Jim Mar-
row will start at center, said Fo-
gleman, with John Flowers and
Bobby Lanier at the insides. The
wings are “still up in the air,
Foglemzn said, with Peach Cole-
man, Charlie. Cameron. Roger
Duttweiler and Greg Simmons
jockeying for the starting spots.

Anchoring the goalie box will
be John Barnhardt, with Kem
Anderson and Harry Hamil in
reserve. Barnhardt and Ander-
son have both lettered.

Fogleman said he plans to sub-
stitute heavily this season, using
about 20 players each game.
‘‘We may even rotate the start-
ing line-up with each game. We
have so much talent in some po-
sitions that we can start play-
ers in some games who did not
start in others.’

Most of the 28 team members
have: developed good ball con-
trol, Fogleman said, but proper
heading techniques must be de-
veloped. ‘‘Our biggest weakness
as a team is heading.” Fogle-
man said. “Other than that. I've
been very pleased with the
team’s ball control.”

Fogleman predicted that Pfeif-
fer and North Carolina State
would provide the booters with
their toughest competition. The
Foglemen add Erskine and North
Carolina Wesleyan to their sched-
ule this year, which terminates
with the conference tourgaament
here Nov. 17-19.
