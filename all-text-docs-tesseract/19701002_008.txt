‘Paintings Communicate
Thought’ Says Saltzman

Artist Marvin Saltzman is
a vivid man. Me

The paintings he is show-
ing presently in the Cunning-
ham Fine Arts Center are
bright in tone, ‘‘I used that

red stripe there because I
like that  red,’’ Saltzman
said.

“IT like to squeeze it from
the tube, I like "to paint it
on, I'd like to taste red like
that.” As Saltzman sat dis-
cussing his’ work with Da-
vidson students and faculty,
his green, European-length
bell bottoms, yellow — shirt
and purple candy-cane tie
out-shone the paintings.

Saltzman's talks during
the several discussions rang-
ed over widely varied sub-
jects but
the problem of the anrtist’s
communication with the
viewer. :

“The painting is an exten-
sion of me,”’ he said. ‘‘What
might be termed honest
painting is a personal ex-
pose, a self-conscious, know-

ledgeable expose. I am ex- ~

‘tending my personality onto
a surface.

However, Saltzman said he
could talk about himself and

his life for extended periods. |

without the viewer knowing
any more about his paint-

centered around .

ings than the viewer would
at the beginning.

‘‘Paintings communicate
thoughts, but not necessarily
the painter's’ thought,"’ he
said. ‘‘I paint as an expres-
sion of my ego. Yeah, I
Want people to
my work, but I’m going to
communicate perfectly only
with someone who speaks
the same language, thinks
and acts like I do and -has
the same background, who
is my twin.

“It’s ithe same as the dif.-
ference between. sexual in-
tercourse and masturbation.
Sexual intercourse is not the

same to me as it is to my °

partner. But masturbation is
the same to me as it is to
me.”

Saltzman feels that there
is a sharp division between
the audience: of a work of
art and the man who creat-

‘eS ed that art. He therefore al-.
so describes art history and

art criticism as fields dis-
tinctly separated from crea-
tion of art.

understand

“Art critics are parasites
of the painter,’’ he
‘just as dancers: are para-
sites on the choreographer,
singers are ? Vas on the
composer and so fgrth.

“T’m not built for that
sort of thing,”’ he added.
“T'm not built for the con-
templation. of somebody
else's navel; I'm built for
the contemplation of° my
own things. I can paint a

stripe on a canvas-_and-just
sit there for hours contem-
plating that stripe.”
