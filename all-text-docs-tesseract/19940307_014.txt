Baseball wins 1 of 3 game weekend

By Rick Thurmond

Perhaps the baseball team
should be renamed the Comeback
Cats. In a three-game series at
home against conference favorite
Western Carolina, the Wildcats
came back from deficits of six, six,
and nine runs, respectively.

Unfortunately, only one of the
rallies resulted in a victory.

On Sunday, the diamond Cats
fell behind by nine runs by the fifth
inning. Clay Hall started on the
mound.

Davidson started on the come-
back trail in the bottom half of the
fifth inning. Senior catcher Brett
Boretti walloped a grand slam to
pull the team within five.

However, they could only
manage three more runs and lost

by a final mark of 9-7. Boretti,
Chad Blackwelder, Paul Brannan,
and Jeff Anderson had multi-hit
games. Brannan also added a sto-
len base, his team-leading third.
Despite reaching base four times,
Brannan, the Cats leadoff hitter,
only scored one run.

On Saturday Davidson split a
double header with Western. In the
first game, the Catamounts jumped
out to 7-1 lead by the top of the
fifth inning. The Cats refused to
die. They came back with six runs
in the bottom half to tie the score.

Brannan began the rally with
a solo home run, his first of the
season. Brannan started in center
field instead of his usual position
in left because of an injury to Jazz
Frietas. Brannan’s shot started a

string of six straight base hits.
Michael New capped the rally with
a three run blast.

Inthe eighth, Anderson tripled
for the Cats. He later came in with
the winning run on a wild pitch.

Freshman Mordechai Stolk
got the win in the 8-7 game and
Mac Chapman got the save.

Inthe second game, Davidson
fell behind by six runs once again.
Brian Cole started. This time, they
could not make up the difference.
The final count was 9-6.

The Wildcats record now
stands at 3-8. In Southern Confer-
ence play, they are 2-4. Rainouts
during the week against Duke and
Wake Forest will be made up at a
later. date. Frietas’ injury is a ham-
string pull. His status is day to day.

Once a dream,
now a reality

By David Dwyer

When sophomore Churchill
Hooff and Carlton Craig, Class of
1993, decided to introduce water
polo to Davidson in the spring of
1993, they really weren’t sure
what kind of a response the col-
lege would offer. Knowing the
growth process would be slow,
Hooff and Craig hoped to initiate

a “grass-roots” program which

which could compete on the in-
tercollegiate intramural level, as
well as with local Charlotte-area
water polo organizations. They
targeted swimmers and those few
students with experience in the
sport as core members of the team,
and hoped to “recruit” additional
players from the water polo P.E.
class offered at Baker.

Water polo as a sport is rela-
tively unique to its field. A typi-
cal match is divided into four
seven-minute quarters; most of-
fensive players establish a perim-
eter around the opposing goal,
and one positions him/herself near
the goal to play the role of ‘quar-
terback’. “There’s a whole lot of
whistles,” says Hooff. “Players
have to know how to act and how

would eventually develop ateam

to cheat... it’s a very important part
of the game.” For this reason,
experience is critical to the success
of ateam. At Davidson, however,
true playing experience is rare.
When the Davidson swimming
teams sought to raise the level of
commitment of their members,
water polo suffered because those
swimmers could no longer be ex-
pected to dedicate a lot of time to
the team. Because the swimming
season has ended, however, those
swimmers have returned to water
polo.

When asked what he saw as
the future of this young program,
Hooff responded, “Isee water polo
at Davidson asa serious club sport,

as a sport that Davidson will be
able to host tournaments for and
generate significant interest in.”
To those students who may have
an interest but haven’t come out
yet, Hooffsays, “Don’t be afraid-
-there are only two students in
the school now who I know of
who have any previous water polo
experience and both of us are out
there trying our hardest to teach
everybody who’s interested to
play.”

Hooff and the rest of the
team welcome the participation
of members of the student body
and hope that water polo will be
a fixture as a Davidson club sport
in years to come.

The wildcat mascot retires

By Will Cobb

The end of an era is coming to
a close as the men’s basketball
season winds down with the retire-
mentof our current school mascot,
“The Cat.” After serving the duties
for four years now, it is time for the
changing of the Cat. Following the
unveiling of senior Greg Fisher at
the regular season finale against
VMI, I was able to conduct the first
exclusive interview with the man
behind the mask, who has kept us
all entertained at athletic events.

Being a mascot is no easy task
and requires a lot of hard work.
The three major obstacles for Fisher
included coming up with creative
ideas that are tasteful, getting out
of situations that are dangerous
like away games, and trying to
maintain a high spirit level. These

problems are often hard to over-
come because a mascot must stay.
active for the whole game, which
usually lasts two hours.

With so many games for sev-
eral sports over the years, Fisher
was quick to respond to his most
embarrassing moment, which oc-
curred at last year’s Southern Con-
ference tournament against UT-
Chattanooga. During a time-out
the Moccasin came out with a spear
and began to stab our Wildcat.
Unarmed and with no where to
run, “The Cat” was helpless and
sadly had to take the abuse.

Another hairy moment oc-
curred three years ago against
UNCC. The 49er was bent over
picking something up when Fisher
decided that it would be cute to
kick the mascot in the behind, but

as Fisher was swinging his leg, the
49er turned around. What hap-
pened following should be obvi-
ous, and the two mascots began

throwing punches, grasping the .

crowd’s attention on the fight in-
stead of the game.

On higher notes, Fisher will
foreverremember the Appalachian
State game in Boone three weeks
ago. Before the game, the Wildcat
and the Mountaineer played alittle
one-on-one, where Fisher sank both
ofhisshots, something he had never
done in costume. The two mascots
continued to work together the
whole game, maintaining the
crowd’s interest.

The most memorable moment
as far as school spirit is concerned
happened last year at the soccer

Men's tennis sees Sti

competitors UNC, USC

By Patrick Jopling

The Davidson men’s tennis
team ran into some stiff competi-
tion over the past two weekends,
for they had to play two top 25
opponents, the North Carolina
Tarheels and the South Carolina
Gamecocks. While both matches
were somewhat lopsided, the Cats
played astrong match against South
Carolina. All matches, singles and
doubles, were close with senior
Chris Parker, taking,a set off Ben
Cook at #3 singles.

Davidson beat Francis Marion

5-0 in a unique four singles and
one doubles format. The team was
sharp, and they destroyed the infe-
rior Swamp Foxes.

Despite the difficult early sea-
son matches and with a4-3 record,
the toughest part of the schedule is
over and conference play will be-
gin soon. The next match is this
Friday at 2:00 versus Pfeifer fol-
lowed by ahuge match Saturday at
10:00 a.m. versus Richmond, who
is ranked tw9,,spots ahead of
Davidson in the Region III
rankings.

3 wrestlers place in So.Con.

By Will Cobb

Coming off an impressive per-

formance in the regular season fi-
nale, the Davidson wrestling team
looked to cap off a successful sea-
son at the Southern Conference
meet yesterday in Asheville.
They did just that by placing
three wrestlers for the first time in
many years. Senior Sam Knowles
and sophomore, Sean Harvey both
placed fourth in their respective
weight classes. The brightest spot
of the day came from freshman
Miles Miller, who placed third in
the 167 category when he defeated
VMI's Hansoni Menefree in the
consolation finals.
Davidson recorded 12 1/2

team points, more than double last
year's total, to reflect upon the sig-
nificant progress the team has made
all year. Miller's performance is
the highest finish for a Davidson
wrestler in years at the Southern
Conference meet and he ended the .
season with an outstanding 29-14
record,

"These guys performed up to
my expectations. Next year I feel
we will do even better, especially
with our youth and a strong re-
ctuiting class coming in," said head
coach Tom Oddo.

, Look for this wrestling team
to have more 3rd place finishes

- and higher in the years to come.
Now it's only a matter of time.

Fans cheered for the mascot at Monday! day's game against VMI.

fans began cheering “Red, Black.”

The moment will be special to ev-
eryone who attended the game on
that cold afternoon in December,
when the whole school and com-

munity came together to cheer for

the Wildcats.

Fisher has really enjoyed his
experience working for Jeanette
Scire and wants anyone interested
in taking his position to contact her
at -2378 in the football office.
