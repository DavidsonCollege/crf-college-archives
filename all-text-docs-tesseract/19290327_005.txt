CAROLINA GAME AT SALISBURY MONDAY

As They Follow the Red and
Black ‘

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

Wow—but how about: those Indians
from over Salisbury way walloping
Monk’s Wildcats last week? That one
certainly hurt, and will be pretty hard
to live down. McInnis and Marrow
both looked like a million dollars after
Mac’s bad first inning, and it wasn’t
their fault that the ’Cats didn’t win.
‘The boys just left their batting togs
at home—that’s all.

Got to give the twirlers mofe
than any two measly little runs if
we expect to win these games. We
believe that Davidson will whip:
any team in the state if the boys
hit for their pitchers. At that, the
Cats amassed eight bingles to
Catawba’s four, but they simply
refused to bunch ’em.

Freddie Ratchford had touch luck

He was sitting pretty to tally
with the tying counter. Captain Fred
seems to have his old eye on the pill
in earnest this year. Those three
hefty swats he poled out Friday looked
mighty good to us.

Elon College usually puts out

a real baseball team and this. year
will see no excéption to that rule.
The Christians will come close to
taming the whole state, if you ask
us. Harrington, the classy little

All Joyal ought to
migrate to the regions of Salisbury
and Greensboro next Monday and

Tuesday for the biggest ball jubilee of
the year. Monday the Wildcats meet
Carolina in Salisbury, while Cornell
University is met at the Gate City on
the following day. As far as we can
ascertain, it’s the first time a David-
son team has ever engaged a Cornell
aggregation, so there is a lot of inter-
est attached to this clash.

Once again Charlotte High romp-
ed home with the bacon in the
State High Track meet. Looks
like some of these schools could
frame up a way to lick the Meck-
lenburg lads, doesn’t it? Those
boys of the Queen City take their
track seriously and they get results
all right.

We extend hearty congratulations to
those Wildcat gridders who this week
complete spring football. It’s a grind
and a hard one, but next fall will show
the reason.

Trackmen will get their big
chance to strut during the holidays
when Captain Pritchett leads his
men up to V. P. I. for a little setto
with the Virginia Technicians.
Don’t know so much about the
Blacksburg crew, but they have
never failed to show a capable
team, and in recent years they
have bested the Cats on the track.
Maybe there'll be a new story this
time. The locals are raring to get
started, and when they do it is go-
ing to be hard to beat them.

Again the ’Cats boast the best dash-
men in the state. Currie, Whittle,
Kell, and Brohard can hardly be equal-
led in this section. Leftwich is the old
reliable weight man who should come
thtéugh with a bang for Pritchett. He
is improving steadily and Dan is plenty
good when he gets going.

“So you are the sole survivor of the
wreck. Won't you tell us how you came
to be saved?”

“T missed the boat.”—Exchange.

Father: “Why are your grades so low
after the holidays?”

Son: “Well, Dad, everything comes
down after Xmas.”—Bison.

Annual Easter Game With Caro-
lina at Salisbury

Tomorrow, the varsity nine meets
Springfield College here. The Spring-
field team is now making a spring trip
through the state after which they will
return to encounter Harvard, Vermont,
and other northern colleges.

Salisbury will be the site of the next
game, which will be played with the Uni-
versity of North Carolina. This is a
traditional game, being played every year
on Easter Monday’in Salisbury. Caro-
lina has its usual good team this year and
the game will undoubtedly be an inter-
esting one.

Another northern team, Cornell Uni-
versity, will meet the Wildcats in Greens-
boro, Tuesday, April 2nd. This team
is noted for putting out a strong nine and
a stiff encounter is expected. .Wednes-
day, April 10 will witness a clash between
the Davidson nine and the Wofford Ter-
riers. The Spartanburg team will meet
the Wildcats on Richardson Field, in the
first game after the spring holidays.

The Freshman baseball schedule does
not, accordingto present plans, open until
aiter the holidays. The first game will
be played with the Belmont Abby nine
at Davidson, Monday, April 8. Another
encounter at Davidson just after this on
April 11, will be held with the Campbell
College team, after which the Wildkittens
will go to Statesville where they will play
the Statesville High nine the next day; a
return, game is to be played at Davidson
on the 17th.

Blue Ridge will meet the Freshman
team on the 19th of April, at Davidson.
The Kittens will then make a short trip
the state playing Duke, Wake
Forest, State and others,

LSnriag. Grid Practice ,
Ends with Holidays

Coaches Stress Fundamentals in
Series of Hard Workouts

With the advent of the Easter Holidays
here Thursday, spring drills for the Wild-
cat grid candidates will be brought to a
close. The practices have covered a per-
iod of about two months and during this
time enough progress has been made to
enable the coaches to begin work in ear-
nest when the gridders are again called
out next fall. The spring drills, as usual,
delt mainly, with fundamentals of foot-
ball but towards the last of the season
some tough scrimmages also found their
way into the menu.

Approximately fifty men answered the
initial call and until the baseball and
track seasons began this number of candi-
dates was not diminished. The players
were daily sent through stiff drills in

punting, passing, tackling, charging, etc.,
and by the end of the eal fe were
going through their paces with plenty of
real drive and form. The outstanding
event of the season, however, was a regu-
lar game between two teams picked from
the candidates. The score of the contest
was close and the game itself was fast
and hard-fought despite the summer tem-
perature. Little else out of the ordinary
marked the season, and although no start-
ling developments were evident, , the
coaches consider the spring drills inval-
uable in preparation for Davidson's 1929
football machine.
