THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 21, 1932

SILVER SCREEN

Wednesday, Sept. 21—Make Me A Star—
(Paramount)

Originally a-story by Harry Leon Wilson
and later a silent picture of a different name,
this picture is still good entertainment.

Stuart Erwin (who seems to be the past
master at the art of appearing befuddled)
as the grocery clerk who wants to get into
the movies, goes to Hollywood and is finally
accepted in a burlesque “western.” He plays
his role honestly and at the prevue is so
shocked to find that he has played the buf-
foon, that he sets out for home and it re-
quires all the skill of a blonde extra (Joan
Blondell) to persuade him to return. The
whole story is full of those incidents that
are somewhat pathetic yet which Erwin
makes so funny. Choice crack: When pre-
senting Joan Blondell with a wrist) watch,
Erwin says: “It’s a little token of my es
teem ... and it’s guaranteed.”

Thursday, Sept. 22—What Price Hollywood—
(R K O)

Another “inside” story of the activities of
those concerned in the production of movies.

Mary Evans (Constance Bennett), waitress
and cinema aspirant, waits on Director
Carey so efficiently that she is given her
chance to become an actress. After some
degree of success she marries a polo player
(Neil Hamilton), so much to the displeasure
of Director Carey that he kills himself in
her home. She is by this unjust
scandal to run away to France where she is
found by. her husband.

Friday, Sept. 23—Down Stairs—(M-G-M)

Some of the best work Jack Gilbert has
done in a long time is in this story written
by himself,

Included in the activities of his vocation
as a chauffeur and his occupation as a Beau
Brummet-there are plenty of episodes in
which the Gilbert talent shows to best ad-
vantage.

Saturday, Sept. 24—Devil and the Deep—
(Paramount)

Charles Laughton’s acting, in his first U. S.
cinema, as the jealous and crazed command-
er of a submarine, seems to have quite stolen
the show from the supposed stars.

In fact so brilliantly is Laughton’'s por-
trayal of the,morbidly jealous husband that
in contrast the hair-raising experiences of
Tallulah Bankhead (his wife) and Gary
Cooper in a sunken submarine seems almost
tame, and the main plot, a romance between
Bankhead and Cooper, seems almost unes-
sential.

Highly recommended.

Monday, Sept. 26—Bird of Paradise—
(R K O)

A group of American travelers land at
Tahiti in the: Hiwaiian Islands and one of
them (Joel McCrea) stays to make love to

The two Davidson coaches who send théir-team against the Duke Blue Devils
this Saturday, in the initial game of the year.

ever.

man and native princess and the assumption
that if a picture has a volcano it has very
little else, there is really some good acting,
fine photography, and many beautiful set-
tings in this picture. The production is said
to have cost $1,000,000,

Tuesday, Sept. 27—Unashamed—( M-G-M)

This picture is based on a recent sensa-
tional murder case in Philadelphia. In_ his
attempt to marriage with Helen
Twelvetrees, a three-million-dollar heiress,
Monroe Oursley takes her to a hotel over-
night and in the morning confronts her
father and brother, almost distracted after
a night of searching. In the fight the brother
kills Oursley.

After all other efforts to save the brother
from the clectric chair have failed, Twelve-
trees turns and saves her brother by draw-
ing on herself the ire of the jury, abandon-
ing her own pride and honor, and depicting
herself as devoid of emotion of any kind.

Prosecutor John Miljan’s jeering speech
on the “unwritten law” is unusual,
