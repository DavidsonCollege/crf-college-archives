and snappy—not only to his com-
pany, but to Fresh as well. He
does very nicely as basketball man-
ager, and is reported to have come
out of the season 47 cents in the
hole. His Law recitations showed
his full knowledge (?) of the sub-
ject—anyhow he got out of his
exam on that “crip.” We'll see him
again, and until me do let it be au
revoir.
| Pap Askew

As the ‘ dynamo for the livest wire
on the Hill,” or in plain English, the
editor of The Davidsonian, “Pap”
Askew has shown himself one of our
best men. However, his association
with C. J. Matthews and “Squire”
Wilson has left its mark on him. So
instead of becoming a preacher, we
look for “Pap” to be the proprietor
of a prosperous business carrying
the sign of the three balls. What-
ever he may enter, we will hear
from him, for “Pap” has a long head
and in spite of his nickname, he has
some young ideas. The less we say
of his love affairs the better for all
concerned.

Skinney Boney

Elwood Rantz Boney is a native of
Kinston, N. C., and has ever shown
his intense local patriotism by ac-
knowledging that fact. This youth
of willow form wishes it announced
to the feminine world that applica-
tions for his hand in marriage will
be received at his home in his na-
tive town; application by mail can-
not be given his personal attention ;
but will be handled by a social sec-
retary whose long service enables
him to decide always as Boney him-
self would do. The young Adonis
promises to treat none of these ap-
plicants with anythihg but the tend-
erest kindness.

High Deputy Puss Booker

Booker, commonly known as
“Booker T.,” who having absorbed
all the learning possible from Elise,
sought further to increase his
knowledge and thus boarded a
northbound dusty freight out _of
Clayton, arriving in Jaybirdsville on
the 7:11 local, special. Booker T.
entered the learned halls of David-
son with all the pomp, pride and
glory of a notorious and illustrious
Freshman.

To this aspiring youth Fresh. Bi-
ble was a crip, but thanks be to R.
O. T. C., which allowed him to walk
off Latin. Booker never intends
mingling with the Latin-speaking
people. Early in life this lad from
Clayton decided to be a “pill roller”
and has thus been a close friend of
the Science Professors. Though a
scientific man he has received his
A.B, degree.

Through Booker’s college career
he has won many friends and lost a
few enemies. He has been a walk-
ing encyclopedia and we challenge
any pretty young lady to work her
chatter box any more than this
young M.D. Go to it, and whether
you get married or go to the Medi-
cal College, may great success at-
tend your way.

Annual Brown

Buck flagged one of the special
slow trains through Arkansas four

ears ago and after it stopped and
Buck was safely seated he asked the
conductor how many more stops be-
fore he would be at Davidson Col-
lege. He entered the office in the
basement of the Library and sep-
arated himself from quite a bit of
his cash.

Buck was a shining star on the
Fresh basketball team, and has won
the reputation of a great orator,
wining a rep at both Junior and Se-
nior Speaking. As a business man
he has shown himself competent, hy
so successfully handling the cale for
the Quips and Cranks.

He leaves old Davidson with the
idea that he is now educated and
ready to show to the world what he

for he did something unusual—car-

cally built bungalow and spend the ried off two dips inside of 15 min-

afternoon of his life in dignified re- | Utes. M
He deeply regrets the in-|!§ to be a doctor, osteopath, p ysi-

pose.

his departure.

Puss Carwile

Physics stud—that’s Puss. He
works from morn till midnight, eith-
er in the Bank or Physics Lab.
Also once each year he spouts forth
upon the Orator’s platform. He’s
a bear, and when asked what he was
going to be, he replied, “A tramp,”
but it won’t:- be many more years
before the Foreign Fields wilt see
his smiling countenance, and hear
his golden speech. To P. B. Carwile
we tender our best regards, and may
fortune be most generous to him.

Clever Clown Carl Cathey

Right this way ladies and gents.
Here we have the one and only
clown of the Davidson Glee Club
in captivity. For two years he has
been inflicting his jokes and clog-
dances on audiences through the
Carolinas but by awarding him a
diploma the faculty has put an end
to this form of ture, thereby
proving itself to be of a humane dis-
position. We predict a brilliant fu-
ture for Carl, whom we believe will
sometime be the mayor of David-
son.

Basketball Chalmers
Here he is. The first man to make
Davidson famous among the blind-
tigers of Des Moines. Dwight was
not only successful in doing this on

his trip to that city last Christmas,

but it is said that several men on

the campus have heard of him. We
doubt the latter statement though

as he has never done anything ex-

cept act as president of the “Y,” cop

about a dozen medals, serve on the
student council and the Davidsonian
staff, and break the ladies’ hearts on
the side line. We predict that he
will come day write a name for him-
self in his work among the Hotten-
tots or Zulus.
Railroad Craig

Mr. R. R. Craig is the overtower-
ing “craig” of potent and latent
power. If he falls from his high
perch let those who stand in his
path beware, for his hidden or re-
serve power is great and indescrib-
able. His hope is to harness this
great reserve and then with great
magninimity to present it to the
world.

Dashing Physicist Douglas.

Open your eyes and see before
you our dashing end. A sure tack-
ler, a player who never fumbled a

ass, he is indeed an all-Southern.
nder his leadership the Senior

football team would have pressed

forward to victory (so he says).

We don’t have to go far to see
him shining in another way. In the
Physics class room and laborator
he is without a peer. As a lady’s
man he breaks all hearts.

He may come back next year.
Here’s hoping he does return and
help make the Wildcats wilder.

Manager Foscue

The Pee Wee of '20, both in stat-
ure and in years. We congratulate
him upon his power to keep up with
his elders. Manager had a wild time
in Atlanta, and still likes to hear
“Venetian Moon.” He came to us
in short paftts, and acquired the
name Atom before he had been here
many hours, but this spring he man-
aged to feed the baseball team,
therefore the name manager. We
hope that everyone knows his name,
Augustus Lindon Foscue, and
though it is nearly as long as he is,
if he keeps up the reputation of Mr.
Gus Caesar, as we have no doubt he
will, it will be hard to keep from
hearing about-him soon.

Louis Peter Porter Good
This is a good boy, from York, S.

has. We say go to it and show ‘em.|C. He saw lots of scenery while in

; That’s some ambition, and if one of

them only is his goal, we'll soon be
coming for treatment.
Fannie Hall

Frank Price Hall, Jr., is another
of Belmont’s industrious sons. He
studies not, yet makes good grades.
His name Fannie stuck to him in his
Fresh year. He traveled a year—at
Annapolis—but decided that the
wiles of Davidson could not be with-
stood, so back he came, to receive
his M. A. Fannie is a cotton mill
artist, and he lives near enough to
visit us once a decade or so. Good
luck to you.

Tennis Shark Hall
First and foremost among our
“Halls of fame” comes the notorious

character bearing the cognomen of
William Frank. His chief claim to

celebrity lies in the fact that he

migrated to Davidson from McCallie
School along with R. T. B. U. L.
Liston. He has held one or two of-
fices, such as football manager and
Senior president of the class of ‘20,

but we will not mention such minor

honors here.
good fellow and will be missed on
the campus next year.

F. W. Hall
President Class '20

Prep Hall

“Prep” or “Major,” hails from the
great metropolis of Belmont, N. C.
From this we might reach the con-

clusion that Prep is a “horse-shoe

shark,” but strange to say, his tal-
ents do not run in that direction. In
fact “Prep” has vastly deeper prob-
lems than that of horse-shoes to
deal with. He studied over the stu-
pendous problem of “what would
the number four man in the rear
rank do upon receiving the com-
mand, Squads right, for three con-
secutive days. Finally, after asking
everybody's opinion upon the mat-
ter, after drawing numberless dia-
grams and after constant thought,
Prep came to the conclusion that
the number four man in the rear
rank would not move a muscle when
this order was given, but quietly
wait for the command, march. No-
body but a military genius could ar-
rive at such a decision and Prep has
ably shown this in the efficient wa

in which he handled the R. O. T. ref
as major for the last year. Not only
in military lines but in everything
else Prep will find success, for his
traits are of the type that com-

W. M. Hall, better known as

Jack Canby Hamilton

In “Wally” we see the making of
a second Zane Grey, or Harold Bell
Wright. Such things as winning fic-
tion medals, writing essays, etc., are
every-day occurrences for him. But
don’t think he confines himself to his
pen. A man has to go south to show
Ham any stunts on a mandolin or
guitar. In addition he belongs to
the far-famed R. O. T. C. Band. His
motto is: “Let the Reds rule.”

Harrell the Ox

“Did you ask who that handsome
man playing the trombone is? Why,
that is the celebrated Ox Harrell,
the man who put the run in Doerun
(Ga.). A good speaker? IL should
say, he will be a second H. B. Dendy.
A ladies’ man? 1 never saw a bet-
er. He broke six hearts at the Vol-
unteer Conference. His ambition?
He expects to go and preach to some
poor heathen Japanese. Did you
mean that? You really want, to
meet him? I see you've flopped like
the’rest of them do. Let’s go.”

Tommy Hawkins

“Tommy” is our golf and tennis
“stud,” as might well be imagined
as he comes from the Queen City.
Not only does he play tennis and
golf, but Tommy is unusually fond
of the humble occupation of fishing.
When the dogwood begins to bloom
and the trees are beginning to bud,
Tommy can be seen every afternoon
with a pole over his shoulder and
his “Johnny pipe” stuck in his mouth
making for the creek and some say
that he will sit for hours without
ever getting a bite. Tommy and the

above mentioned pipe are always
seen together and neither is ever
seen without the other.. He makes
friends with everybody and there’s
not a boy on the campus that does

not know Tommy Hawkins.

“Scrub” Hollandsworth

Scrub hails from the “Old Domin-
ion” state, and it is difficult to cor-
relate this nickname with his serv-

ices in “Pershing'’s Own” regiment.
Undoubtedly here is a person in
whom extremes mect.
man of regular habits.
month, sometimes
times less, he took a
end journey over the Winston-
Salem division of the Southern; re-

more,

turning at 11:50 a. m. Monday (ex-
cept once when the engine was
found to be without water, and
Scrub got two class cuts as a result).

He attended Bitzer’s Bible class on

third floor Watts regularly, except

on above mentioned dates.
Coy(o)te Hunter

Contrary to what his name almost

indicates, Coyte adheres to the quiet
life except when he takes an occa-

sional bold venture: with the fair
(John M. McCormack’s con-|

sex,
cert in Charlotte). It is in the field
of oratory, however, that this ex-
soldier is so well and favorably
known at D. C. (Feminine) “Cus-
toms in Wartime Europe,” delivered
before the Phi. Society; a joint de-
bate with a representative of the
faculty on, Resolved: That the Stu-
dents Should Haye a Holiday on the
Anniversary of Armistice Day, de-

livered before a “bolsheviki” meet-:

ing of students; and his “Rep” win-
ning Senior Oration, are a few of his
masterpieces. ;
Baldy Jamison

Dr. John M. Jamison is one of the
most interesting of Davidson's re-
cently acquired alumni, And his
erudition in his particular and pecul-
iar field of study has attracted much
attention; his monograph on “Can-
nibalism as a Fine Art,” has been
pronounced one of the best works of
its kind yet published, embodying as
it does the results of his seven years
of investigation in the Figi Isfands.

Dr. Jamison’s private virtues are
as pronounced as his public ones. In
politics he is ever constructive: he
voted for the recent statute which
created the city of Myers Park, N.
C., a flourishing Carolina town, the
population of which he swells by

Sleeping Beauty Liston

To R. T. L. Liston, our noted
orator from Alabama, we yield the
palm for prowess in capturing nick-
names. He came to Davidson bear-
ing the sobriquet, “Sleepy.” But his
talents were soon recognized and he
became known as “R. T. B. U. L.,”
“Marcus Porcius Cato,” and “Latin
Liz.” Education would certainly be
more in demand could everyone cap-
italize his classical knowledge as he
has done. He has carved himself a
niche in Davidson’s walls. And, we
vainly look for one to fill his place.

President McAlister

Among the best men to leave Da-
vidson as graduates is Lacy McAlis-
ter, otherwise known as “Ikey.”
Lacy was an active man in the stu-
dent body and in athletics, In the
fall of 1918 he won his football D as
a halfback and this year added a
star to his letter. During his Fresh
year Lacy was president of his class
and this year is president of the stu-
dent body. Because he is known as
the hardest man on the hill, very few
Fresh dare to call him “Ikey,” even
if they bought suits from him. Lacy
is of the type that characterizes Da-
vidson and will add hohor to any in-
stitution.

Dug McArn

Behold before us our singing ball
player, The Caruso of the diamond.
This first-sacker is a terror to the
enemy, a bulwark of strength to his
team. His prowess as a son of Or-
pheus is so established that he holds
a place on our world-famed quartet.
His past has been great, but we pre-
dict a still brighter future. If he
goes into business, he cannot but
succeed. (For reference, ask those
who boarded at Mrs. Brady’s). We
wish him best luck as next year he
goes to McCallie to teach and on the
side to send men to Davidson.

Bishop McClure

We have many preachers in em-
bryo, but there is only one in our
midst who has had any real experi-
ence and training, and that is
‘bishop. Mac is safe at a distance,
but at close range his tongue is
deadly. He is a great ladies’ man, as
Flora Macdonald can testify. Bisho
hopes to end up on the mission field.
Here’s hoping he will be as fluent in
Siamese as he is in English. 1f he
is, poor natives!

Treasurer Gus McGirt

Chiefest of Eumenean soap-box
orators, greatest of diplomats, high-
est of statesmen—C. A. McGirt, now
in deed and in truth launches out
into the deep. He announces that
he will not be guilty of the crime
against humanity of remaining sin-
gle till he is twenty-three years of
age.

War Hero Nichols

_ Nick is our star athlete. When
it comes to horse-shoes, marbles and
mumble-peg there is not & man in
the class of '20 who can hold a light
to him. There is one game, however,
of which we have never found him
guilty: pitching Nickles.

Nick is also a ladies’ man, being at
the time of writing off on a5 orting
tour to Barium Springs and other
points which are as yet unknown.

Principal Cooke Neal

We don’t see a great deal of Pro-
fessor Neal since he took up his new
work of imparting his knowledge to
the Davidson Graded School, but we
do get a glance at him promenading
with the fair sex, his “co-workers.”
He’s not the kind that shoots a long
line about the ladies, “but when you
get him alone,” my, “Phil” hasn't a
chance in a hundred. As all A. E. F.
ex-soldiers, you can safely bet that
“Cook” got much valuable experi-
ence from his promenades with the
French mademoiselles of gay Paris.

Fleet-footed Outfielder Richards

Behold the lad from Liberty Hill!
One doesn’t often see a product
from the sandhills with any “force,”
but Johnnie has proven to us that a
