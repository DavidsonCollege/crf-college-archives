If you haven’t visited the basement of the gym recently, then
I’ve got some news for you. The weights aren’t there anymore.
Almost all of. the weight equipment has been moved from the
basement of the gym to beneath the stadium. Why?

According to Athletics Director Gene Bingham the main
reason is liability. If
someone were injured
while working out, the
College would be liable. Of
course, if one were eaten
by an alligator while
swimming down at the

George
Murrell pool the College would be
liable. Besides, it wasn’t

the College’s decision to move the weights— it was the Athletic
Department’s decision with the urging from the football
coaches.

Students currently just don’t have adequate facilities in which
to work out. According to Dean of Students Will Terry, many
students have contacted him about the current problem. Many
students use the weights with great regularity and are more
than a little upset about the recent change of policy.

When I spoke with Bingham about the possibility of
regaining student access to the weights, I ran into some
problems. Bingham said that only supervised students will be
allowed to use the weights. Supervision means that a Coach of
faculty member must be present. This makes it easy for a
varsity athlete to work out, for the coach of the team can
supervise the workouts. But someone who works out on his own
will undoubtedly have difficulty finding supervision. From my
point of view, I see the whole arrangement as quite absurd.
There are many students who are far more knowledgable in the
field fo weight resistence training than perhaps anyone in the
athletic department, and yet they cannot use the weights
without supervision.

What can be done? If students response is great enough, then
changes will have to be made. As it stands right now anyone
wishing to work out may do so with any varsity team. The work
out schedules will be posted in the gym. This may turn out to be
a losing battle, however, since the weightroom is likely to be
crowded during these times. Go ahead and try this
arrangement. If it doesn’t prove satisfactory, then complain to
anyone who will listen.

I not at all satisfied with the new arrangement. If your are
serious about working out then contact me (-6369). A faculty
member has volunteered his services to supervise a group of
students. We will be working out on Wednesdays and Fridays
from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the afternoon.

Wrestlers grab two victories at H-S

By PAUL GRIFFITH
Staff Correspondent

Last Saturday while most of
us were enjoying Midwinters
weekend, the Davidson wrest-
lers gutted out three though
matches in a quad meet at
Hampden-Sydney. The team
involved were Davidson,
Hampden-Sydney, Colgate,
and Lynchburg College. The
Wildcats came out well, defeat-
ing Hampden-Sydney and
Lynchburg and bowing to an
extremely tough Colgate.

Among the weekend stand-
outs, Coach Bob Estock was
especially pleased with the per-
formances of junior Scott Smith
and freshman John Breiden-
stine.

Smith was 2-1 for the week-
end and has amassed a whop-
ping 14-5 record for the season.
In his loss to Colgate, Smith led
his opponent until the last 30
seconds. Estock emphasized
that he wrestled an excellent

‘match against a tough oppon-

ent from Hampden-Sydney .-
John Breidenstine compiled a

The Davidson wrestling team is hard-working and “packed with potential.”

perfect 3-0 record at Hampden-
Sydney and was the only winner
for Davidson against Colgate.
Estock has been ‘‘very pleased”’
with Breidenstine’s consistently
good performances and foresees
a bright future for the wrestler.
Breidenstine’s record for the
season stands at 9-7-1.

Coach Estock also comment-
ed that he was happy with the
recent performances of team
captain Dave Nichols, sopho-
more Lance Stokes, and fresh-
man Todd Kimsey.

Kimsey, a first-year wrestler,
has won four of his last five
matched. He also placed fourth
in the recent tournament at
Washington and Lee. Estock
believes Kimsey is gaining con-
fidence and experience that will
be conducive to winning
matches.

Although Lance Stokes was
only 1-2 last Saturday, Estock
said he wrestled a good match
against his Colgate opponent
and that he really came through
against Hampden-Sydney. In

that match, Stokes pinned his

opponent in 45 seconds!

Senior Dave Nichols has
caught fire. After placing first
in the Washington and Lee
Tournament two weeks ago, he
came on again and won two out
of three matches at Hampden-
Sydney. Nichols pinned his
opponent from Lynchburg, de-
cisioned his man from Hamp-
den-Sydney, and lost a close
match against Colgate. Nichols
has made vast improvements in
his wrestling ability and is
definitely a force to be reckoned
with. — ;

Coach Estock is definitely
pleased with the team’s per-
formances and improvement.
He emphasized that the David-
son squad is very young and
packed with potential. Next
year, the Wildcat wrestlers will
lose only two men due to
graduation. Estock is optimist-
ic about upcoming matches. -

With over-half the season
gone the ‘Cats record stands at
5-5. Saturday the Davidson
wrestlers will take on Furman in
Johnston Gym at 1:00 p.m.
