Canterbury Club

Hears Rev. Barr
At Second Meet

The Canterbury Club of the
Episcopal Church held its second
meeting of the new year Tuesday
night in the Y lounge.

The Rev. John M. Barr, pastor
of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in
Huntersville, addressed the group
on the subject: High and Low
Church in the Episcopal Church.

Bob Dunbar opened the meeting
with a brief worship service, after
which Mr. Barr discussed the his-
torical development of the differ-
ences within the Episcopal Church,
which were originally doctrinal in
nature, but now are largely ex-
ternal and procedural.

One In Spizit

Mr. Barr emphasized that the
church is one in spirit, in spite of
minor variations in doctrine and
procedure, and closed his talk with

the admonition: In important
things, unity; in unimportant
things, variety; in all things,
charity.

This, he said, should be the be-
lief and practice of all Episcopa-
lians concerning diversities, within
their church.

Al Ballinger took charge of re-
freshments after the regular meet-
ing was adjourned, and an informal
discussion, chiefly relating to Holy
Communion, followed Mr. Barr's
formal address,

Next Meeting

The next meeting of the Canter-
bury Club will be Tuesday night,
February 5S, at eight o'clock, in
the Y Lounge, President George
Bason announced.

‘The aim of our Canterbury
Club,” he states, “is to serve the
mission of Christianity here at Da-
vidson, to increase among the stu-
dents a better understanding of the
faith and practice of the Episcopal

Spring Practices Deadline |s

A limited spring football practice was the most important
decision reached at the National Collegiate Athletic Association
meeting in Cincinnati last week. Davidson's delegation included
Dr. Frontis Johnston, Mr. P. K. Scott, Coach Crowell Little,

and Coach Dick Redding.

The number of out-of-season
practice sessions allowed and the
number of days in which these ses-
sions are to be held for the two
major sports, football and basket-
ball, are: football, 20 sessions, with-
in 30 calendar days; basketball, 20
practice sessions within 24 days.

Tt has not yet been decided
when spring football practice
will ‘begin here at Davidson.

“Because of the conflicts im-

posed on football players par-

ticipating in other sports at the
same time as the football spring
practice, it is difficult to assign

a time that will be feasible to

all,”. said Coach Buddy Chand-

ler on Wednesday of this week.

The reason given for baseball's
not being mentioned was that it has
not proved as objectionable as the
other two sports. However, it was

noted by Athletic Director Scott

that a committee has been formed
to study the seasonal dates for. all

sports and this committee will re-
port its findings next year at the

meeting,

Another important issue that was
su-
pervision and controt of TV. This
will be done by restricting the num-
ber of games that will be televised

passed was the continued

in a certain area.

An alternate method will be
that of blacking out completely
certain areas from any games so
that better gates may be as-
sured.

This decision was based on the
observation in experiments in TV
by a special investigating commit
tee over the past year in which time
the same type supervision was used.
The subject of TV produced the
hottest debate of the convention.

Several echools, notably
Pennsylvania, contended that
control of TV is sdegal and
would subject the organization
to an anti-trust suit by the gov-
ernment. There was no large
dissenting vote against the
measure as it passed 163-8.
On the question of bowls the body

called for a further study of post-

season games by a special commit-.

tee and meanwhile placed a ban
on making new commitments for
such games to be played after Jan-
vary 2, 1953.

Davidson has been a member of
the NCAA since 1936, when it also
joined the Southern Conference.
All) the Southern conference
schools are in the organization.

ATHLETIC COUNCIL CALLS FOR
FUTURE CONTESTS ON CAMPUS

The Athletic Council has decided to play all 1952 home foot-
ball games at Richardson Field, it was announced by Athletic

Director Paul Scott here today.

Also discussed at the meeting was the 1952 football schedule
which has already been published. The present and future program
of Davidson's athletics was also reviewed,

Especially well received by the group was the recent action by
the Southern Conference on scholarship aid. Each school has to
submit an annual report on all aid received by all athletes, giving
the amount, source, and individual. If a student accepts aid in excess
of what the conference allows, it will make him ineligible.

Poll Nets

Ad-lib

Advice, Opinions

The Davidsonian straw vote poll ‘of the student body on
athletic policy brought a flurry of ad lib vote-in advice. Some
showed some thought, others just that the signee could write.

A cross section glance produces:
“I am in favor of a soccor team

at Davidson (unsubsidized).”
“Either de-emphasize athletics or

get in a league where we can do
some good. Either one or the other,

but not the present program.”
“Iam in favor of de-emphasizing

The Davidsonian poll on Da-
vidson’s athietic policy con-
sisted of three questions:

1. IT am in favor of the
present athletic program at Da-
vidson.

2. I am in favor of further

emphasizing athletic subsidi-
zation at Davidson.
3. I am in favor of deempha-
sizing athletic subsidization at
Davidson.

The results, by classes, were:

Preshmen; 1—37; 2—106;
3—28,
Sophomore: 1—-13; 2—77;
3—38.

Junior: 1—19; 2—53; 3—26.

football and further emphasizing
basketball and tennis.”

“Let’s don't be in the middle of
the road. If we can't subsidize to
the limit, then go to the other
extreme.”

“I favor changing the program,
not subsidization.”

“I am in favor of continuing the
policy, but transferring to a smaller
conference.”

“I am in favor of emphasizing
other sports, such as wrestling..."
(signed, a wrestling letterman.)

“I am in favor of emphasizing

only one sport to an extreme—
that is, give scholarships in only
one sport.”

“I am in favor of placing more
emphasis on basketball and the more

minor sports, rather than football.”

“I am in favor of de-emphasizing
whoever or whatever is conducting
this snide, underhanded poll.”

Saturday i oon

Spring term registration has been
going on this week, and is to be
concluded tomorrow, Saturday, re-
ported Registrar F. W. Hengeveld.
Those students who have course or
schedule changes should have al-
ready registered.

For most freshmen and soph-
omores no changes are neces-
sary. They simply continue
their firat semester courses,
Registering is done this week so

that books may be ordered and re-
ceived for the new courses before
second semester starts.

Fees for the second semester are
to be paid at a later date. Each
student will receive a letter explain-
ing the payment of fees, along
with a spring term registration
card similar to the form used first
semester.

The letter states that spring
term fees are due January 31.
With the aid of the enclosed
card, the student can determine
the amount he is expected to
pay.

The card is to be filled out, and
if possible, a check prepared for the
exact amount due.

If any student is uncertain about
being in college the spring semes-
ter, he is asked to stop by the
cashier’s office and sign a tentative
registration card. Payment of fees
in such a case can be deferred until
definite status can be determined.

Scholarship Cash
Is Now Offered
On New Standing

At its last meeting, the Commit-
tee on Scholarships and Loans
made two changes in policy which
vitaly affected all students who
now hold scholarships or grants,
or who intend to apply for such aid
in the future.

From now on, scholarships or
grants-in-aid will ordinarily be
awarded for an entire year rather
than for one semester at a time.
In other words, a student who re-
ceives notification of an award at

amount specified, regardless of his
grades at the end of the first semes-
ter.

This policy will apply immediate-
ly,. and means, in effect, that
scholarships and grants for the cur-
academic reasons at the end of the
rent year will not be revoked for
first semester.

Payments will, however, con-
tinue to be made in two in-
stallments, approximately one-
half of the total award at the
beginning of each semester.

Catalogue Face Lifting To Include
Illustrations, New Briefs on Courses

A better-looking and easier reading college catalogue is the
goal of a faculty committee which has been working toward
rearranging the format of the present booklet since the early fall.

Headed by Dean C. K. Brown,
the group has made recommenda-
tions that the book be printed in a
larger type and that illustrations
be included. The proposed new
‘book will be larger and the course
descriptions are to be either re-
written or the present descriptions
standardized as to length.

More Appealing

“The action is being undertaken

to make the catalogue more appeal-
ing and informative to prospective
students and their parents,” ex-
plained Dean Brown. He added
that such a project has been in
mind for some two years, but that
no one was able to devote their
full time attention to the project.

D. C. Stalwarts Pitch Tent At Salem,
Spend Night As 300 Girls Stare Wide-Eyed

By MIKE MYERS

Saturday morning Johannes and

Admiral Peary had his nerve go-| John got together and decided to

ing to the Arctic and facing the
perils of the North. Certainly
Livingston is to be admired for
braving the dangers of darkest
Africa. But these men were ama-
teurs when compared with David-
son's Miedema and Lindmarker.

Johannes and John spent last
Saturday night in a tent, protected
from the whipping wind only by
the walls of Clewall and Sisters
dorms at Salem College.

With only a thin tent and a
brick wall separating them
from 300 females these men
became the first in history to
survive, or even attempt such
an ordeal,

They seem none the worse for
their adventure, but as yet no word
has been received from Salem.

Johannes received a small pack-
age from home fast Friday. In it
were his camping equipment, a
bicycle, and enough cooking uten-
sils to equip an Italian restaurant.

take a shake-down cruise to the
rolling mountains of North Caro-
lisa.

That afternoon they caught

a side with six other boys

and headed for the hills at

Winston-Salem. The ride took

them as fer as Salem College,

which, after all, is as good a

place as any to rough it.

Our boys, living up to true Da-
vidson tradition, remembered the
article in the handbook about camp-
ing on other college lawns, so
sought the president’s permission.

They went into the lobby of
the main building there and
plopped their equipment down

(the tent when folded is about

the size of an inflated pontoon

bridge).

President Gramley wasn't there,
but his son, Hugh, showed the mod-
ern Marco Polos a nice camping
spot within calling distance of the
president's house m case they were

bothered. y
They put the tent up—a nice little
four-man, double deck job—and

tated a clam about the details
of how this was done.

Johannes went on. “At ten the

cooked a typical Dutch meal of | next- morning I was in front of the

beans, meat, cheese, bread and po-
tatoes.

Occasionally an unsuspecting
girl would come strolling by
and go screaming off in the
opposite direction, but this
didn’t bother our heroes, “It re-
minded us of the timber wolves
howling in the mountains back
home. Made it all quite
realistic,” they said.

Next they took two of their 300
hostesses to the movies. Before
going to bed that night they sat
around their campfire and sang
Swedish songs. The 600 eyes and the
heads in curlers looking out of the
windows didn’t bother them in the
least.

“That night it got very cold.
In the middle of the night I
had to borrow a blanket from
one of the gisls in the dorm.”
Johannes then conveniently imi-

tent in my “doieshals” (Dutch for
skivies) making tea when a boy
taking his date to church came by.
I offered them tea but they
couldn't speak — evidently not
thirsty.”

They left and in about two
minutes five or six other
couples came back with them
just to stand and admire the
tent.

They looked hungry with their
mouths open, but they didn't speak
either, After breakfast they washed
dishes from a tap on the side of
one of the dorms.

Then they packed up and came
back to Boys’ Town. They hope
a deputation of Salem girls wilt
come here some day for camping.
That's all I could get out of them
except one final comment. “We
plan to camp at W.C, after exams,”

"Great Exodus’’

rumor was still only a rumor this

morning " according to Registrar F. W. Hengeveld.

Mr. Hengeveld, with a constant
finger on the pulse of the student
body, said that so far as he could
tell only the “usual” number of
students would be withdrawing
from Davidson at the end of the
first semester, January 30,

Authentic Sounding

For the past several days the very
authentic sounding word has been
passed from mouth to mouth that
a group of students, numbered at
127, would be leaving school at the
end of the semester. No reason is
attached as rider to the rumor,

“The odd thing about the whole
business is this figure of 127," Mr.
Hengeveld = smilingty remarked.
“Dean Bailey heard about it about
the same time I did, and he came
to see if I had any facts to ‘sub-
stantiate the rumor. Both of us had
had the number put to us as 127.

“No more than the usual namber
of men have come to me about
transferring to another school, en-
tering the service, or going to work.
1 would say we lose ‘generally 30
or 40 boys at the end of our first
semester. Even with the draft scare
and flee. for air force recruiting
stations this time last year, we didn’t
have wild rumors like this. If it's
anything more than a wild rumor,
( certainly know nothing of it.”

Beavers End Call
For Old Clothing

Over 100 pounds of used cloth-
ing has been collected by the Beaver
Club for contribution to needy
European children and young
adults, The spare collegiate duds
are now on their way to New York
for processing.

Before the Christmas holi-
days the athletic club placed
bags around the dorms and
launched their plea for gifts.
Receiving last-minute handouts,
the Beaver men closed their
drive after Christmas and sent

* {he clothes on to Gotham.

This drive is the first of two
yearly activities sponsored by the
undergraduate lettermen. In the
Spring they hold an auction for
‘senior heirlooms. Usually. accom-
panicd by a band and colorful
charivari, the auction perenially
draws ..a big crowd.

Facts Unfounded

Despite its incredibleness, the
rumor grew and persists. The “be-
say that “they-say” talk
from the various fraternities com-
bines for the 127 total. Yet a check
by The Davidsonian failed to pro-
duce any startling figures. Kappa
Alpha, supposedly losing’as many as
eleven members, placed a more con-
servative estimate at six, including
three who failed to return after
Christmas.

Most senior observers shrugged it
off with a “c'est le exams” rational-
ism, comparing the rumor to the
famous student body night parade
of December, 1948.

Service Frat

Has Book Bar

Alpha Phi Omega, the recently
formed Scout service fraternity, de-
cided in its meeting on Wednesday
to establish a used book clearing
house for all men wishing to buy
or sell their used books.

‘At present, it is planned for the
room to be open from ten o'clock
until twelve o'clock in the morning
and from three thirty until five
thirty in the afternoon during the
aveek of January 25 through Feb-
tuary 1, 1952,

The service fraternity decided on
this project in order to facilitate the
manner of obtaining books of pre-
vious.use. The clearing house will
be held in the room adjacent to the
book store in Chambers basement.

All students having books
that they wish to sell are to
bring them to the specified
room early in the week of Jan-

uary 25 through February 1.

A commission of five cents will

be charged by the fraternity in

order to help finance other
worthy projects.

Another project mentioned at this
meeting was that of helping Cor-
nelius Negro Scout Troop No. 18
to get uniforms.

Alpha Phi Omega would like to
ask all students to see if they have
any old scout. uniforms at their
homes that they care to contribute
or sell to this troop. This project
is still in. its first stages,

At Meeting On February 5

An opportunity to join the Student Volunteer Movement

for Christian Missions (SVM)

will be afforded Davidson men

Wednesday, February 6, at 8:00 p.m., in the Y lounge, when

George Knight leads a meeting
here at Davidson College.

Knight, acting as moderator for
the group, will explain in general
the meaning and purpose of SVM
and will outline projected activities
for the local chapter, and then he
will throw the floor open to dis-
cussion and questions about SVM.

“The Student Volunteer Move-
ment for Christian Missions,” he
States, “is a movement of students
and senior friends committed to the
task of making Jesus Christ known,
loved and obeyed in every sphere
of life and every part of the wortd.

“It members are joined in a com-
mon declared purpose “To Serve
Christ in the Werrld Mission of
His Church.”

The inspiration for forming a
Davidson chapter of the Stu-
dent Volunteer Movement
comes from the recent 16th
Quadrennial Conference of
SVM in Lawrence, Kansas,
which a large number of David-
son students attended, and
which will be the subject cf the
chapel program Thursday, Jan-
vary 31, and of the Westmins-

for the formation of a chapter

ter Fellowship meeting this

Sunday night at 6:30 in the

Quadwranglers’ Room.

Davidson's delegates to this Con-
ference met the night of Sunday,
January 13, to discuss plans for
setting up an SVM chapter here,
and decided upon the date indi-
cated above, February 6, at 8 p.m.,
as the time for an organizational
meeting of all Davidson students in-
terested in the movement,

Knight emphasized that all
students interested in the mis-
sion work of the church,
whether at home or in the
foreign field, are invited to at-
tend this meeting. The SVM is
interdenominational.

The national organization of
SVM has prepared pamphlets on
“eight questions students ask about
missions,” which will be discussed
in a series of articles in The Da-
vidsonian, beginning this week.

The first question: “Why Force
My Religion on Others?” is dis-
cussed in this issue.
