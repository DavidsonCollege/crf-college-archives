“Restoration is a funny
field. It’s a hard circuit. And
it’s a hard circuit to break
into.”” Angela Barnett spoke
from experience. Over spring
break she went to Williams-
burg to explore the art of
restoration. The preliminary
connections were arranged
through the Office for Experi-

‘ential Programs and from
there Angela scheduled’ meet-
ings with an architectural
historian, a curator, and the
director of education at Wil-
liamsburg.

“TI was initially interested in
seeing which field of restora-
tion I should pursue, -either
the ‘structural aspect or the
decorative art aspect. The
tours opened up other direc-
tions, for example the field of
sociology through architec-
ture. The big thing about
Williamsburg is that no one
knows anything about the

people who lived in the houses.

‘There’s a big gap in knowleage

when it comes to the social
life. Through restoration,
patterns can be unearthed.”
Angela was also exposed to
the problems of restoration
such as the dilemma’ of
whether to restore’ the archi-
tecturally important  struc-
tures or the historically impor-
tant ones. She saw haw spec-
ilized people have to be to

work in Williamsburg. ‘It

takes four years of training af-
ter graduate school to be good
enough to work on your own.
Angela summed up her
week in Williamsburg by

saying “The most important

part was exploring the various
aspects of restoration, seeing
how important methodology
and research are to restoration
..and finding out that you
have to be damn good at it to
get in. ”

Margaret Anne Bumgarner

“You sort of have to psyche
yourself into all this blood and
guts. Birth is an act accom-
panied by an unbelievable
=amount of blood and guts,’’
said Margaret Anne Bum-
gardner after witnessing two
births during her Spring
Break Externship.
Margaret is interested in
. rural medicine. She located
- Dr. Judi McGahey, a country
doctor, in Spruce Pine, N.C.,
through Ken Wood’s office.
She was especially im-
pressed when she heard that
_ Dr. McGahey had invited
_ Appalachian women in to wit-
». ness her own children being
born. ‘This ‘public birth’ was

to help rid the Appalachian
women of superstitions they
have about childbearing,” ex-
plained Margaret. ‘This is an
example of the public health
program that is being used in
Yancey County. It is aimed at
exploding myths.”

Margaret continued, ‘‘I saw
how public health programs
consider emotional aspects of
the patient’s life, and how
these programs explain every-
thing to the patients to try
and take out the mystery.”

Margaret also saw how a
woman doctor balances a fam-
ily and a career and gets a joy
out of both.

gave his own philosophy for
photography. ‘‘The trick is to
find a scene that expresses
something and then work for
composition. But a lot of it is
serendipity.”

In search of new techniques,
Ron also works with his prints
in the darkroom, cutting and
combining to create a new
effect.

“It’s rewarding when you
see the final print and you see
that you’ve caught some-
thing.” Ron often takes off for
me a day or two to search for

Working with modelling ag-
encies in Charlotte, Ron pho-
tographs models and does

other commercial work. A.

psychology major with photo-
graphy as a side interest, Ron
hopes to have an exhibition at
the Peregrine House soon.

Photography is ‘“‘an evoca-
tive process, for me and the
viewer.’’ He explained how
photography is more than
self-expression, because by
separating out and capturing
little intricacies, he can make
people more aware of their
world.

“Prostaglandin D2 may have

Medical Center investigating
the effects that a newly dis-
covered hormone, prostaglan-

He was invited by the
Southern Society for Clinical
Investigation to present his
findings at their national con-
vention on January 27 in New
Orleans.

During conventions, he re-
ceived the Student Research

Award. When Chris was asked
what stands out in his mind
the most about his experience
in New Orleans, he replied,
“Bourbon Street’’.

Throw your cares and tensions up in the air

“Habit-forming,”’ ““infectious,”’
“‘addictive,’’ are used to describe
juggling which, in its most conta-
gious form, has hit Davidson College
Campus.

The jugglers you have seen wander-
ing around the Union lobby are
products of the juggling class that
meets every Wednesday afternoon at

always wanted to, I thought it was for
people especially coordinated,’’
Brown said. Apparently even the
uncoordinated can master juggling.
Crosby explained, ‘“‘Most people think
it’s hard, but it really isn’t. Most
people can do it if they take the time
to try.”” According to Brown, one of
the goals of the juggling class is to rid
people of these illusions. The job is

one of “simplifying, de-mythologiz-
ing” juggling.

The new juggler’s previous miscon-
ceptions about juggling coupled with
the rapid results achieved in the class
(Brown and Crosby guarantee you
will begin tu juggle within fifteen
minutes) give the new juggler a sense
of accomplishment. He is excited by
the discovery that he can master what

he thought was an impossible trick.
Perhaps at this moment of
discovery, the infectious nature of
juggling is at its strongest. Crosby
warned, ‘If you learn to juggle, you'll
want to juggle more than you’ll want
to study.” Steve Peeples, a student in
the class, also said, ‘‘Don’t do it if you
have a lot of reviews. It’s addictive.”

2:30 in the Morrison Room.. Taught
by assistant director of the Union
~ William Brown and freshman Doug
Crosby, the informal -class varies in
size each week. Brown calls it a
“walk-in class’’ where two or three
new people come every Wednesday.
Both Brown and Crosby are
experienced jugglers. They juggle
mostly for fun, even though Crosby
has taken courses at Florida State
University’s Circus School and is
considering becoming a clown.
Brown spoke of the public's
misconception about juggling. He
admitted that he shared this miscon-
ception. ‘‘Juggling was one of the
things I never helieved I couldido. hut
