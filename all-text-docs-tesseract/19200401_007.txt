knew what the points were. Askew,
the last member of the affirmative,
gave the best debate of the evening.

R. Bitzer, the leader of the nega-
tive, in the course of his speech an-

; nouned that there were a _ million

men out of jobs. The society won-
dered why one of the million did not
take Mr. Bitzer’s job on the debate.
R. R. Craig ably supported the nega-
tive, but was considerably off the
subject.

To everybody’s surprise the de-
cision was given to the negative.

The janitor’s salary was raised to
thirty dollars per term. This raise
was necessary because the janitors
of the two societies were threaten-
ing to form a union.

Mr. Parker, an old member of the
Eu, gave a few words of greeting to
the society, after which the whole
assembly adjourned to the picture
show.

Phi Society

Brevity was the watchword of the
Phi Society at its regular meeting
Saturday night. There was a meet-
ing, but the meeting together was
about all that was accomplished.
Through some misunderstanding on
the part of the program committec
and the speakets no one seemed to
know who was to speak or what he
was to speak about. It later develop-
ed that the president wasn’t in a re-
ceptive mood for anything less than
“The Miracle Man.” Accordingly
Mr. Nichols (in the absence of Mr.
Spence) seconded a motion for ad-
journment and society was contin-
ued at the picture show.

EU. SOCIETY PROGRAM.

There will be a joint mecting of

ithe two societies next Saturday

night to elect officers for the coming
term. All members are urged to be
ptesent. There will be no regular
program, but all Seniors desiring to
obtain credits will have an oppor-
tunity to deliver orations. No pro-
gram has been announced in the Phi
Society.

tion between the student body and
student council here, and appealed
to the students to co-operate with
their officers, and uphold the honor
system.

At this point, Dr. Harding propos-
ed that The Davidsonian, which ar-
rived just prior to Professor Wood’s

‘address, be given a cheer. This pro-
posal was taken up with mighty en-
thusiasm.

The next number on the program
was one of the most delightful of
the evening. It consisted of a selec-

jtion of songs rendered by David-
son’s Quartet—Messrs. H. B. Brown,
'McArn, Curry and Shields. So in-
_sistent were the demands for “more”
that after singing “Somebody
and a splendid arrange-
‘ment of “Old Black Joe,” they gave
“I Love You Just the Same, Sweet
and this being encored,
sang “I’m Goin’ Home.”
_ Because of his splendid record
; while in Davidson and since leaving
his alma mater, the next speaker
| claimed a large share of interest.
| Prof. C. L. Wilcox, headmaster of
McCallie School, spoke on “The In-
stitution of Honor System and Stu-
dent Government in Davidson.” His
address was able and full of excel-
lent points. He told us of incidents
connected with the inauguration of
the honor system and self govern-
ment here, and left with us some ex-

_(The affirmative must have heen too ‘ceptionally good advice for strength-

ening these college institutions.

“Exercise caution in electing the
president of the student body. 1
don’t believe a man can come out of
this office as popular as he was when
jhe entered, if he does his full duty.
jAnd it is a man who is not afraid, in|
spite of this, that you want to|
elect,” said Mr. Wilcox.

In conclusion, Mr. Wilcox sug-

_gested mutual, public pledging of
jnewly elected officers and the stu-
dent body, the creating of a strong
sentiment against certain bad prac-
tices of the students, introducing an
honor store, advertising Davidson in
prep schools by the Glee Club, and
,other college organizations, and fre-
/quent meetings to instruct Fresh-
lmen in Davidson's traditions and
| principles.
| The final speaker of the evening
was Rev. W. S. (“Squire”) Golden.
His address on “The Value of an
{Honor System” was masterly and
-created a deep impression on his
‘hearers. Mr. Golden paid a high
tribute to Davidson and the work
she has done for the world through
_her honor system.

“The responsibility of upholding
the principles of the honor system
rests upon men who are here. You
can bestow upon old Davidson the
highest possible gift—a perfect hon-
or system.”

Photographer McIlwaine made a
flashlight picture of the crowd of
banqueters and the brilliant festivi-
ties were brought to an end.

Too much cannot be said of the
success of the Greater Davidson
Club’s banquet, nor too much praise
be given those who made this suc-
cess possible. Hereafter there will:
be a similar function each year; but
for “pep,” good eats, good speeches,
good spirits, and a hilarious good
time from start to finish, the ban-
quets to come will have a hard time |
excelling the one held last Thursday |
night. A better way for beginning |
a Better Davidson Campaign could
not have been hit upon.
