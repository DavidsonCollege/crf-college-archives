DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., FRIDAY, NOV. 19, 1954

Gift Fund Choice Will Come Monday

Y Meeting At 10:20
To Select ‘54 Project

BY Ki) Lewis
On Monday, Novmber 22, 1954,

at 10:20 a. m., a meeting of the}|

membership of the Davidson Y.M.
C.A. will be held in the ballroom
of the College Union for the pur-
pose of selecting the Y Christmas
Fund project. The freshman chap-
el which usually meets at this
time has been canceled so that all
interested men can attend this
meeting.

Each year the student body con-
tributes to a Christmas Gift Fund
which is given to some worthy pro-
ject chosen by the students. Last
year the fund went to move and
rebuild the Negro Community Cen-
ter here in Davidson. In other
years it has been designated for
various foreign projects.

Suggested Projects

A committee chosen from the
student body has studied the pro-
ject suggestions received from va-
rious organizations and would like
to submit the following four for
the consideration of the member-
ship of the Y.M.C.A:

1. Church teams working in war-
torn Greek villages need funds for
the reclaiming of land and raising
the standard of living in rural
areas. Technicians are working in
these areas and need funds for ma-
terials and equipment.

2. World University Service has
suggested to us the establishment
of a student’ health ward in the
Tjisarua Sanatorium in Indonesia.
Disease is not uncommon among
students in this area of the world,
and facilities for them are very
limited.

3. The Central School for Mis-
sionary Children in Lubondia,
Africa, is in need of a station wag-
on. The school has grown recently,
and transportation has become a
major problem. :

4. Funds are needed to support
the work of Di. Nicholas Gonchar-
off, an ex-Red army tank com-
mander, who is doing research on
the whole question of the Chris-
tian alternative to communism. He
is creating propaganda material to
be used in Africa and Southeast
Asia.

All students are urged to attend
this membership meeting and in
so doing share in the promotion
and execution of the work of the
Y.M.C.A.

Junior Class

Mr. Bass, the representative of
HerfJones will be at the student
Store Monday, November 22, from
8 a. m. to take orders fot col-
lege rings.

ROTC Unit Readies °
For N. C. Inspection

The Davidson R. O. T. C. unit is
busying itself this week for an in-
spection of the outfit. Colonel
Henry C. Settle, Chief of the North
Carolina Military District, will be
the inspecting officer.

Colonel Settle is to arrive at the
college on Tuesday, November 23,
1054, for a “look-see” into the or-
ganization, operation, administra-
tion, and drilling ability of the
Davidson regiment. He will inspect

both the cadre and cadet set-ups,
with emphasis on the cadets.

He is to make it a day-long visit,
and in addition to the inspection
tours, he will lunch at the College
Unton with President Cunningham,
Dean Spencer, Colonel Sapp, David-
son PMS&T, and other members
of the faculty. ‘

Colonel Settle took over com-
mand of the North Carolina Mili-
tary District this past June when
Colonel Grabam left. He was an
enlisted man in the Army from
1927-32, and was given his 2nd
Lieutenant’s commission in 1983.
He became a full Colonel in 1952.

The R. O. T. C. unit has been
working toward this inspection
ever since the first drill in Sep-
tember. According to comments of
officers of the unit, the regiment
this year is in better shape for the
inspection than it has been in the
past several years.

With the new policy of student
cadet officers instructing the low-
er classes, a more homogeneous at-
titude and willingness toward hard-
er work have been evident so far
this semester.-

“| MOREHEAD POLL:

Student Opinion On
Drinking Analyzed.

In the past two weeks the Da-
vidsonian through the feature de-
partment conducted the second in
a series of monthly student’ opin-
ion polls on national and local is-
sues, These polls are not designed
to influence opinion or prove the-
ories but rather to register stu-
dent thought and action on sub-
jects of importance and interest to
the college.

The poll this month was conduct-
ed by 24 representatives from all
four classes; gathered cross-sec-
tion views from 55 percent (458)
of the student body, and covered
all six dormitories, the Guest
House, Carolina Inn, The Village,
and five boarding house residen-
ces.

Question No. 1. Do you approve
of drinking for yourself?

Yes No
Total 45.2% 54.8%
Freshman 36.7 63.3
Sophomore ...... 45.7 543
Junior 53.0 47.0
Senior ___. 52.4 47.6

It was emphasized by those reg-
istering votes that these questions
applied to drinking outside of the
college. This poll was not concern-
ed with drinking at Davidson.

Question No. 2. Do you approve
of drinking for othere?

Yes No
Totel 70.7% 293%
Freshman .. _... 67.1 32.9
Sophomore . ... 66.4 33.6
Junior 76.5 23.5
Senior - 18.7 21.3

Though opinions were not re-
quested many volunteered their
thoughts on the subject. It was the
general consensus of opinions ex-
pressed that drinking was a mat-
ter of individual conviction — and
as a result a mild indifferance was
shown to this (No. 2) question.

Question No. 3. Do you drink?

Yes No
Total 44.2% 55.8%
Freshman 34.8 65.2
Sophomore . ... 43.3 §6.7
Junior —......... 50.1 49.9
Senior 52.6 475

It was quite evident throughout
the poll that students expressed
their own thoughts freely and
without influence from others. Of
opinions expressed the majority
came from the negative rather
than the affirmative side. Many
ideas were given in regard to the
drinking rules here at the college,
but these were not relevant to this
poll.

nan Forum Presents Segregation Issue

“Problem Considered On
National, Local Levels

Special to the Davidsonian

The thorny problem of segregation came to the fore for
all of Davidson Wednesday in a series of three addresses by
Dr. James McBride Dabbs of Mayesville, S. C. and the Rev-
erend Beverly Ashbury of Zebulon, N. C. For the first time
this college year students and townspeople were presented
with the facts and cases of the current controversy which is
rocking the south and border states.

SPEIR

Dr. John R. Cunningham, president of Davidson College,
and Dr. Blake R. Van Leer, president of the Georgia Institute
of Technology, announce a college program jointly adopted
by the two institutions to train future engineers.

The Georgia Institute of Technology agrees to accept stu-
dents, with the recommendation of the administration of
Davidson College, who have completed a three-year liberal
arts course at Davidson. They will be accepted as junior stu-
dents in one of the Institute’s eight engineering departments.

The students will be granted de-
grees in engineering upon the sat-
isfactory completion of individual
programs of work. The programs
will be six quarters cach, totaling
not less than 114 quarter hours.

Pre-Reguisites

The details of these programs
are to be decided by the Dean of
Engineering and the Curriculum
Committee of the Georgia Insti-
tute of Technology. The programs
will include the bulk of the work
of the last two years at the In-
stitute. However, they may also
include a small amount of fresh-
man and sophomore prerequisite
work not given at Davidson Col-
lege. The details of the three-year
liberal arts program as given in
the 1954-55 Davidson College cata-
log are as follows:

First Year

Bible 6, English 6, Mathmatics
6, Foreign Language 6, Physics 8,
ROTC 3; Total 35.

Seeond Yeer
English 6, Mathematics 6, For-

eign Language 6, Chemistry 6, His- |

tory 6, ROTC 3; Total 33.
Third Year
Mathematics 6, Bible 6, Physics
8, Physics or Chemistry 8, Draw-
ing and Descriptive Geo. 6; Total

Students preparing for Chemical
Engineering, Ceramic Engineering,
or Textile Chemistry will take two

years of Chemistry and two years
of Physics. All others will take one
year of Chemistry and three years
of Physics.

Two Degrees

Students entering the joint pro-
gram, effective immediately, will
study three years at Davidson, then
go to Georgia Tech for two years
in one of the eight engineering
courses there. Upon graduation
they will receive both the bdche-
lor of arts and engineering de-
grees in five years instead of six
years normally required to earn
the two degrees. .

Davidson has a similar affilia-
tion with the Columbia University
School of Engineering. This pro-
gram was initiated in 1053 and is
now in effect.

One Of First Programs

Georgia Tech is one of the first
engineering schools in the South
to adopt this new three-two edu-
cational program. Davidson and
Southwestern University are at
present the only two institutions
to be selected for affiliation with
Georgia Tech to enable students to
obtain two degrees in a liberalized
course,

The objective of the three-two
plan, by the integration of a three-
year liberal arts course and a two-

Drinking Rule Stated,
Provisions Explained

At the closed meeting of the
Student Body last Friday, a student
raised the question of interpreta-
tion of the drinking rule. The fol-
lowing is a discussion of the drink-
ing rule.

Article Vitl, Section 2: No stu-

dent shall be guilty of drinking
alcoholic liquors, being under
the influence of, or having the
same in his possession, on the
campus.
_ Members of the Student Council
are honor bound, and members of
the Student Body duty bound, to
report violations of the above stat-
ed rule. The smelling of alcohol on
the breath of is considered by the
Council to constitute “under the
influence of” as far as members
of the Council are concerned. This
student rule is administered com-
pletely by the Student Body and
the Student Council.

The faculty rule concerning
drinking is as follows:

A student will be suspended
from Davidson College if he is
found guilty of drinking, posses-
sing, or being under the influ-
ence of en alcoholic beverage
while within the town limits of
Davidson, or while attending any
off-campus event sponsored en-
tively or in part by Davidson Col-
lege or any organization connect-
ed with Davidson.

The enforcement of this rule lies
with the college and not with any
student organization.

Docherly To Speak
In Chapel Dec. 2

On December 2, Dr. George M.
Docherty will speak in chapel. Dr.
Docherty has spoken here many
times before and his coming is an-
ticipated with interest. He was
born in Glasgow, Scotland, and for
many years has been pastor of the
New York Avenue Presbyterian
Church in Washington. He will
conduct a series of services at the
First Presbyterian Church in Char-
lotte during that week.

Dr. Docherty was the speaker at
the fall services of Davidson last
November. His topic was ‘Concern-
ing the Faith.’ His it was to leave
many Davidson students with a
deeper feeling of meaning con-
cerning their faith.

History of the Case

Beginning the series of forum
addresses in chapel Wednesday
morning, Dr. Dabbs traced the his-
tory of the segregation problem
from its ‘beginning’ in 1896 with
the Supreme Court decision in the
case of Plessy vs. Ferguson through
58 years to the inevitable decision
made this past spring.

On May 17, 1954, Chief Justice
Earl Warren of the United States
Supreme Court gave the decision
which put an end to the concept
of separate but equal segregation
which has been in effect since the
1896 decision of Plessy vs. Fergu-
son. The Plessy case, coming at the
end of a long period of reconstruc-
tion and compromise following the
Civil War, was the final gasp of
the Negro in his losing effort to
maintain himself on the ground of
equality that he had taken such
great advantage of in the years
followings the Civil War. By it, the
Supreme Court pronounced that
there was no violation of the
“equal protection” clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment in segrega-"
tion so long as the Negro was giv-
en equal facilities. Thus, in effect,
the Court signified that the United
States was ready for the south to
attempt to solve its own problem
of race,

For over thirty years following
this decision little was said of the
race issue. At the polls and in
social life the Negro was in his
place in the South.

Segregation, however, has been
a rising issue since 1930. The
“separate but equal” ruling began
to lose effect on the one hand,
and on the other the people of the
States began to sense an existing
inequality in everything, including
opportunity, in the south. With
the change in public opinion new
cases regarding segregation began
to appear before the Supreme
Court at about the same time that
cases came to the Court involving
the right of Negroes to sufferage.

Cases in 1935, 1938 and 1960 re-
garding the right of Negroes to
attend graduate schools of state
universities resulted in a progres-
sion of decisions which stated first
that Negroes must be admitted to
the state law school if one of equal
calibre is not provided in the state
for Negroes, second that Negro law
schools could be judged inferior
on the basis of “intangibles”, ie.
prestige of the school, quality and
variety of curriculum, bredth of
opportunity, etc., and finally that
segregation of a Negro in a white
school was also unconstitutional
