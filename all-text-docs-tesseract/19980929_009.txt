ello, hello, folks,
here I am once
again to waste

your time, which could be
better spent finding job op-
portunities forO.J. Simpson
(I will eventually get tired
of this opening, but for now
you'll have to deal.) Well,
well, what to write about
this week. I don’t know
how many of you read Ed
Diggins’ s article in the Arts
& Living section of last
week’s paper, but if you
haven't, I definitely suggest
going and reading it now. I
must personally congratu-
late Ed on a truly hilarious
column; I have never
laughed so hard in my life.
Perhaps I should allow him
to attempt to write the funny
columns in Op-Ed and I'll
do something crazy like
sleep.

For those of you who
did read Ed’s article, you'll
remember the Mt. Vesuvius
analogy that he made. |
would just like to point out
that thousands of people
were killed in the eruption
of Mt. Vesuvius because
they became covered inash.
That’s right, thousands of
people became human stat-
ues because they got cov-
ered by what Mt. Vesuvius
shot out. Now, imagine jux-
taposing those two stories.
Not a pretty picture is it,
folks, and unlike “There’s
Something About Mary,” I
will not go into the grim
details of that event. You
can draw those conclusions
on your own. Franks and
beans, franks and beans.

Now, if you’re won-
dering why I am rambling
oninthis column worse than
Mumbles from “Dick
Tracy,” I will explain. If
you are not wondering about
this, please proceed to the
next irrelevant paragraph. I
don’t know about the rest
of you lucky students here
at Davidson, but I have re-
ceived about three hours of
sleep in the last week. I say
“received” because in this

that I have run fresh out of
ideas for anything to write

between bravery and lunacy,
and often I’m not quite sure
on which side I stand. Al-
though looking at Chuck’s il-
lustrious career, the same
could easily be said for him.
Who in their right mind would
subject themselves to the
kinds of experiments he did
voluntarily? A college stu-
dent in need of money, prob-
ably, but he was well past his
college years.

Now, where was I? Ah
yes, sleep deprivation. I’ve
noticed that people on this
campus are falling sick faster
than a peasant in London, En-
gland, 1348 AD. I think our
bodies are collectively going
on strike, and there is not a
thing wecan do about it. Right
now, my brain is screaming at
me like Scotty from Star Trek,
“You cannot push it any harder
than this, Cort. What are ya, a
bleeding fool? You’re gonna
make us crash. I'll try and get
a few more days out of the

to see the “behind-the-

itis folks, “A Fresh Opinion:
the Lost Column,” (Ok, so

. it’s notas exciting as the lost

“Lucy” episodes, give me a
break all right?)

Hello again, folks.
Well, itcertainly has been an
interesting week in the news
hasn’t it? Or at least that is
what I am told, seeing as
someone keeps stealing my
The President
has fallen farther in the last
week than Steve Gutenberg’s
career did after “Three Men
and a Baby.” Now, I know
what you're thinking: “Oh
man, he finally stops talking
about his girlfriend, only to
start making fun of the Presi-
dent with jokes so old that
even Letterman wouldn’t
touch them.” Well, guess
what folks, I’m not going to
do that to you. However, I
am going to touch upon a
subject that is equally close
to the President — sex in the
news. Now, understand that
when I say “sex in the news,”
I don’t mean the uncensored
Sam Donaldson and Barbara
Walters video but rather the
stories that these people
present to us.

Why is it that the sex
scandals we hear about are
never about the people we’d
like to-see? For example,
look at the most recent in-
ductees to the sex scandal
hall of fame: Michael Jack-

son, Marv Albert, Eddie
Murphy, and Bill Clinton. I
have no desire whatsoever
to know what these people
do in their spare time, or
during business hours, in
Bill’s case. Wouldn’t you
hate to find out you were the
guy Bill was talking to while
he was engaging in “im-
proper sexual relations?”
Yes, but back to not bashing
the President. To quote
Monty Python, “I object to
all this sex on the television.
I mean, I keep falling off!”

Seriously though, why
can’t we ever hear about the
beautiful people of the world
caught up in sex scandals?
Well, I guess we do — it’s
called porn —- but why can’t
we mainstream it? I don’t

- know about the rest of you,

but I have no desire to hear
about the marks that can be
found on Michael Jackson’ s
meat and two veg. That’s
just something that needs to
stay between Michael, Bobo
the chimp, and the five-year-
olds. Also, not only are the
main characters involved
unappealing, but look at the
people they chose as candi-
dates for their misguided
sexual advances. Michael
had children, the woman who
was with Marv had well,
Marv, Eddie Murphy had a
transvestite prostitute, and
Bill not only had Monica,
but Hillary as well. Not that
Hillary is all that unattrac-
tive, she just frightens me
worse than Janet Reno do-
ing a strip tease.

Well, I started this col-
umn with the best of inten-
tions, and I apologize for the
fact that it was about as fun
as watching a colonoscopy
being performed on Roger
Ebert. I promise that the
next column I make will be a
little better, but I’m allowed
to have a bad column every
once in‘a while, because I’m
good enough, I’m smart
enough, and doggonit, at
least I’m not as bad off as
Bill. Take it easy, and I'll
see y’all ‘round.

ave you ever watched “South
Park’? Well, if not, do not go
away just yet. But if you have

watched it, you know that before every
episode, “the pow-
ersthat be” display
what appears only
a silly disclaimer
as to the content of
their

farce to follow.
The disclaimer
ends, to paraphrase, “no person should
ever watch this show.”

Until recently, I did, not under-
stand why on Earth such a disclaimer
was needed. What was obvious to me
— a show not to be taken seriously; a
show not to get upset over when nearly
every group of society save rich, thin,
white, males was insulted; and a show
not to be taken in the same light as say,
the six o’clock news — was not so
obvious to many in the population.

Then I thought that maybe I do not
realize the way the world is because
I'm so damn cool. My coolness just
absorbs me, causing me to live in a
naive world. InCrabbie’s world people
walk around in their white laced shoes,
in their favorite old t-shirt, and a with
good head on their shoulders. People
rarely, if ever, go sticking their hands
into a hot looking fire because they
realize that looks are not always de-
ceiving. When they walk upon a major
state highway, the people of Crabbie’s
world also stop about ten yards before
they reach that
highway and say to themselves, “Those
cars are moving at a high rate of speed.
I bet if I stepped out onto that highway,
one of those vehicles would probably
hit me and rip me to shreds.” Crabbie
land is a nice place, but it is not a
realistic one.

My message for the underclass-
men then — when ingesting informa-
tion, always be aware of the context in
which that information is placed. If
you feel this lesson is merely common
sense, then you are already one step
ahead of the game. Crabbie is proud of
you, and itis unnecessary to read today’s
lesson any further! For all others, let

me give you an example.

Outrageous statements

°

Do not read my column in the
same way you might read a carefully |:
thought-out and meaningful letter to
the editor.

My column is neither
thought- out nor
meaningful nor
should it be read as
such. After all, Ido
not actually want
you walking around
with poor self-es-
teem just because I
told you two weeks ago that you were
not cool. ;

Realize that my column is not
serious. Crabbie is a coward who
hurls insults at people from the safety
of hisown room. These insults, how-
ever, are not researched or well rea-
soned arguments intended to be in-
cluded in my next thesis defense. They
are merely outrageous statements
which may or may not reflect how
Crabbie feels about a particular situa-
tion.

With this in mind, I hope that
nobody would ever take offense at my
column. I have big plans to target
many groups and people here — espe-
cially those Southerners. I even have
plans to take a shot or two at the
president of our school.

For this reason, the next Golden
S.A.G.T.A.S.S. Award goes to Presi-
dent Vagt. He gets the ‘Should(A)
Gone To A State School Award’ for
his attempts at turning Davidson intoa
state school. Since when was Davidson
about saving a buck and not about the
students? It starts with the infirmary
and Chambers, but where will it end?

Back to my point: Common sense
is a valuable asset. It is too bad not
everybody in the world is blessed with
it. So with reality in mind, I leave you
with this disclaimer on all future ar-
ticles:

“Crabbie Says” is an adult col-
umn which in no way intends to offend
its adult subjects. It is a farce which
only wishes to express the opinion of.
Crabbie, however valueless.
Crabbie’s articles have no connection
with intelligence or unfamiliar Latin
dictum. Nobody should ever read this
column.

Changes to the Union Café

and insures more consistent night-
shift productivity (stocking,
cleaning, cash register balanc-

faculty, and staff over the past -
three years. Despite the tre-
mendous work of Julie Mills
and her staff, criticism of our
speed of service, the crowded nature of
the facility, and the unchanging menu
have been common. Clearly, our cus-
tomers have concerns about some of the
changes. Since the school year has
begun, we have listened carefully to
students through the SGA, the Union
Board, individual conversations, and
numerous e-mails. '
In that time, we have restored a
number of products that students regard
as essential. Most notably, 20-ounce
bottles are back and we are busy figur-
ing out a way to refrigerate these drinks
without obstructing aisles and without
requiring hours of labor to keep them
stocked. We have expanded our candy
and chip selection, returned frozen en-
trees, and brought back a number of
non-food items (medicines, batteries,
i ucts,etc.), We have begun

the process of expanding our grill menu
so that ultimately patrons will not see
the exact same menu every day. Cus-
tomers tell us that we have made good
progress on our goal of speeding up
grill and deli orders, particularly dur-
ing the busy lunch hours. New prod-
ucts have been added, and others are
forthcoming (specialty coffees, fresh
salads, fresh baked goods, smoothies,
oil-free french fries, chicken fillets,
and more).

We have restructured our staffing
in a way that reduces the number of
hours of student employment, but we
have offered evening shift hours to all
returning student Café workers and
some hours even remain unfilled. This
restructuring allows the grill to operate
whenever the Café is open, provides
experienced support to grill workers,

ing).

This doesn’t represent all that
will happen at the Café. Creating
a program that satisfies most stu-
dents, faculty, and staff while running
it ina fiscally responsible manner will
require continuing communication.
We are not through listening; this is a
dynamic Situation. We have worked
earnestly to address the complaints of
the last three years. We are also at-
tempting to establish a program that
can cover its own cost. Any time a
business enterprise of the College loses
money, it pulls money from other pro-
grams, all of which are regarded as
vital by some constituency.

For the most part, the community
has responded to our requests for feed-
back in a thoughtful and helpful way.
This is greatly appreciated. Continue
to help us by contacting your SGA
representatives or Union Board mem-
bers or send me suggestions directly
via e-mail.

Church relatedness

The very

nition of the impor-

education.

phrase brings shiv-

ers to my

spine with its cold-

ness and oppressive

connotations. The church, especially
the Presbyterian Church in regard .to
some of its recent politics, is often not
an organization I want to be related to.
Still, I do not think Davidson's “church
relatedness” has to be negative or op-
pressive. By affirming our ties with the
Presbyterian Church, Davidson is also
affirming the spiritual aspect of human-
ity.

The statement of purpose reads,
“Davidson is dedicated to the quest for
truth and encourages teachers and stu-
dent to explore the whole of reality,
whether physical or spiritual, with an
unlimited employment of their intellec-
tual powers. Faith and reason must
work together in mutual respect if
Davidson is to realize and maintain its
particular vision of academic excel-
lence.” By virtue of relating itself to the
Presbyterian Church, Davidson claims
that it values both the intellectual and
spiritual journey of its students. For
this, I applaud Davidson and its recog-

My gripecomesin .
the carrying out of
this vision. If
Davidson is going

to publicly commit itself to the spiri-
tual development of its students by
declaring its church-relatedness, we
need to embrace this vision not just as
an institution but as acommunity made
up of students, professors, and staff. If
we intend to holistically educate our
students, then we cannot section off
spirituality as appropriate to only cer-
tain spheres in Davidson. Our belief in
spiritual development must also infil-
trate the classroom setting. Often what
we are taught in class evokes questions
about our won spiritual journey. We
need to look towards each other for
answers and recognize our mutual
search for “truth” and “meaningful-
ness.”

Church-relatedness can be an op-
pressive term, but ideally it can mean
that we are a community centered on
love and acceptance. If we are offi-
cially “church-related,” we need to al-
low these concepts to manifest them-
selves in all facets of life at Davidson.
