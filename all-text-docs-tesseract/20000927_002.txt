Andy Baxter can feel the blood on his
hands.

The Davidson United Methodist minister
is on a crusade to end what he considers to be
an unjust and flawed institution: the death
penalty.

He’s already won the support of seven area
churches as well as the Davidson Town Board.
All have called for a temporary moratorium
on executions in North Carolina— due in
large part to Baxter’s leadership.

But Baxter, 30, says his toughest challenge
hasn’t been winning over local ministers or
politicians. It’s the students at Davidson.

“T think there is some apathy,” said Baxter.
“I'd sa¥ with the vast majority of students, I
haven’t been able to tell that they care.”

Baxter cites two reasons: the heavy
workload that seems to monopolize students’
attention, and—perhaps more importantly —
the feeling of isolation that comes with living
on a small college campus.

“There’s so much emphasis on preparing
you for the outside world that you sometimes
forget you’re living in it,” he said. “People
tend to forget they have responsibilities to the
larger community.”

“My goal is to get Christians on the campus
to see how their faith really matters on this.”

Baxter is one of a growing number of
pastors and community leaders fighting to
halt executions until the government can prove

class isn’t a factor in determining who gets
the death penalty, and that defendants are
provided with competent attorneys during
their trials. But unlike most, Baxter has di-
rected much of his efforts toward young
people.

Through weekly bible studies that will be
held on-campus for the first time this year, his

AmeriCorps programs and the annual mis-
sion trips to South America he leads college
students on every summer, Baxter is hoping
‘to reach more youth than ever and educate
them on what he feels is a critical aspect of the
Christian faith.

“In the Bible, we’re called to forgive our
enemies,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we
have to be friends with them. But it does mean

‘we don’t kill them.”

Baxter says leading the anti-death penalty
movement in Davidson is one of his most
important responsibilities as a minister.

“For reasons I’m not quite sure, it’s taken
on urgency with me,” he said. “I feel so
passionate and alive and vital. It’s very life-
giving. It sounds strange to say that, but it’s
true.”

In May, Baxter led his own and seven other
Davidson area churches in drafting a resolu-
tion calling for a temporary moratorium on
the death penalty. The churches also hosted a
presentation led by Charlotte attorney Jim
Cooney, who has represented several men on
Death Row. Among the 60 or so people in
attendance were each of Davidson’s five town
commissioners, who in early July unani-
mously endorsed the ministers’ resolution
and became the sixth N.C. municipality to
call for a moratorium.

Convincing the commissioners “wasn’t
hard,” said Baxter. “They were all behind it.
That was really encouraging.”

On the eve of all N.C. executions since
1997, Baxter has led candlelight vigils on the
Town Green in front of the public library.
Drawing as few as six and as many as 50
people, the vigils are Baxter’s way of remind-
ing people that as citizens, they have a stake
in their government’s actions.

“Whether you agree with the death penalty
or not, it’s done in all our names,” he said. “I
want people to realize that. I want people to
know blood is on their hands in that way.”

Students struggle to cope with ant infestation

By Aaron Houck
Editor-in-chief

“Insects abound in this region.” Stu-
dents do not need this warning from the Red
Book .to tell them that there are pests: all
around. Ants, especially, can be found across
campus searching for their next meal.

“They [the ants] are tiny! They congre-
gate in the corners [of our rooms] and throw

parties. They

crawl all over

also _encoun-
tered the tiny
insects. ‘‘Last
year, when I
came back
from Christ-

turned on my
sink and a
stream of ants
shot out,” he recalled. “Now whenever I turn
on the water, I let it run for a while before I put
my toothbrush under it.”

The ants are more than an inconvenience
at Little Library, however, where ants de--
stroyed an expensive piece of electronic equip-
ment.

The library was holding a personal copy
of a video tape on reserve for a class when the
library staff discovered that the tape was
infested with ants.

“We took apart the video, sprayed it with
bug spray, and put it in a box over night,”
described Jean Coates, Head of Library Cir-

culation. “The next day, we thought it was
clean, so we put it back on the shelf, and then
someone checked it out.”

This patron returned, however, to say
that the video was stuck in the player.

“When I went to move the machine, lots
of ants and their eggs fell out,” shuddered
Coates. “It was really gross.” The college
returned the player to the manufacturer to be
repaired, but according to Coates, some ex-

pressed concern as to whether “ants were
covered by the warranty.”

“We try really hard to keep. the ants °

under control,” explained Coates. “That is
one of the reasons we do not allow food or
drink in the library.”

The Residence Life Office (RLO)i is well
aware of the problem and has taken measures
to prevent the ants from taking over.

“We have an ongoing contract with Caro-
lina Pest Control,” said Kurt Holmes, Asso-
ciate Dean of Students and Director of Resi-

dence Life. “I think of itas aregular payment

like the heating bill or electricity bill.”

According to Holmes, the problem of
ants in the residence halls stems from the fact
that the students are not aware of what draws
the pests. Obviously open food containers
will attract them, but the insects seek out
“really dirty laundry and toothpaste left in
sinks.”

Tohelp students fight off the unwelcome
visitors, RLO will provide the short term
solution of ant traps until Carolina Pest Con-
trol returns to
campus. If re-
quested, RLO
can arrange to
have a room
sprayed for in-
sects. Most of
the sprays used
are mild
enough that
students need
not vacate their
rooms. The
college has
used Carolina
Pest Control to
deal with ants,
termites, hor-
nets, rodents,
and even bats.

Holmes
noted that, “the
problem is that
students don’t
contact us.
Rather than
getting us to
take care of the insects, they go out and buy
spray which really doesn’t work well.”

The problem with ants can be greatly
reduced by “keeping a clean room and keep-
ing food closed,” stated Holmes. “If you
leave an open pizza box on the floor from
Saturday night until Monday morning, you
will have ants.”

Not all students suffer from an ant infes-
tation, however. ‘“We’ve been blessed on
Fourth Watts,” said Joey Harris ’02, a hall
counselor. “I think the ants are just too lazy
to climb up four flights of stairs!”
