Class Softball

Softball is now competing with the varsity teams for number
one spot on the sports schedule as members of all classes are
turning out on the intramural field to either play or pull for
their respective classes. The tournament started Monday
with the Juniors and Freshmen emerging from the first en-
counters victoriously. “Speedball” Davis Thomas looked good
for the defeated Seniors allowing only one hit in the five innings
he pitched, but’ gave way to George Marsh who was cred-
ited with the The Seffiers thought the game was on
ice having a four runtead in the sixth inning, but the Frosh
came back to eke out a one run victory. At the other end of
the field the Juniors were trouncing the hapless Sophs 8-4,
but a protest was filled when the Juniors put the same man
in twice and the game may have to be replayed.

Golf Team At Athens

Continuing their Spring travels the varsity golfers
breezed down to Athens, Georgia to try their luck in
the Southern Intercollegiate Tournament. This is the
tourney in which last year’s Captain Granny Sharpe
showed so well losing to the winner of tHé tournament,
while the Davidson team finished close to the top.
Tommy Bumbarger had the toughest Nick of their re-
cent trip when he shot a brilliant 73, only to be beaten
eleven strokes by the Georgia number one man who
was merely setting-a new course record against him.
Charlie Upchurch and Frank Mebane have been rack-
ing up the majority of the points for the team in the
third and fourth spots while Bumbarger and Cavert
are struggling with the hotter shot-makers.

Frosh Starts Baseball

Ed Lucas Jost a heartbreaker to Carolina last Friday after
giving them only four hits before being relieved in the ninth.
“It was his own wild throw to second while attempting a cut-
off play that scored the two winning*runs. The Freshmen
started their baseball season with a game with Concord High
on the home field, and another one here today against Mars
Hill, They 6oked pretty good against the varsity in the
practice game though they don’t have a plentiful supply of
pitchers. Here’s hoping they can keep up the precedent they
set on the gridiron and in the cage earlier this year, being
undefeated in both sports.

2 Trackmen Soil

Track records were falling thick and fast in the meet

with V. P. I. last Saturday, but none of them will hold

due to the slight gale that was blowing up from the

South. McMiullin of Tech got a good start in the 100

yard dash and coasted along in the breeze for a mere

9.6 Later on in the meet Arch Taylor, aided by the

same gentle zephyer, ran the high hurdles in 15 seconds

flat and the lows in 24.5 which is pretty fast sailing.

Bill Loy set another unofficial school record for the

A40 even though he came in behind a V. P. I. speedster.
Thoughts: [It looks as if a winning doubles combination
has been hit on by the tennis team in Buck Archer and Gene
Sutton, who are replacing last year’s team of Shore and
Sproull, who were always a constant threat to their opponents.
Archer and’Sutton won all three of their matches while on the
trip during the holidays. The wrestling team started their
spring training Monday with only four reporting for’ the
