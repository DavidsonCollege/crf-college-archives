vision of the alumni secretary this year
and is published for the benefit of the
alumni, Ernest Milton, a graduate of |
last year’s class, is the present incum- |
bent of that position. |

scattered throughout the United States
and a number of foreign countries. The
aim of the Loyalty League has been set
that “every alumni become a member.”

1 Prizes Will Be Awarded Golf Tournament

Well Under Way

Returns from the fall golf tournament
have been coming in slowly. Only the
first flight has been completed, though
all matches: were to have been finished
last Saturday, October 30th. As several
of the most consistent players are in
this flight, however, its results are very
important with regard to the quality of
the team to be chosen.

S. W. McGill was winner of the first

flight with Billy Wolfe runner-up. Both

of these players performed remarkably
well, breaking the match record of the
local course. McGill had a score of 68
for the 18 holes of the match, while
Wolfe was close behind with a score of
69. Both had a total of 25 putts apiece
for the course.

work and are classified in a lower class.
