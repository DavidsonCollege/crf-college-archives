Alumni occupational fair suggests career opportunities

By Susan Warren

The harsh reality for life after
Davidson is quickly approaching
for many students. The Alumni
Relations Department is trying to
make the future a little brighter by
sponsoring events such as the Sec-
ond Annual Alumni Occupational
Fair which took place Tuesday af-
ternoon, September 14, in the
Chambers Gallery. .

The Careers Office planned
the event by choosing young

Consultants
finish initial
study of

campus life

By Leigh Rawdon

Two professional consultants
spent three days, Wednesday to
Friday, asking questions and col-
lecting answers about the campus
feelings for a new student Union.
Representatives from MPC
and Associates, a firm based in
Washington D.C. which does ar-
chitectural and legal consulting for
many colleges and universities,
took notes and recorded the
thoughts and opinions of students,
faculty, administration, as well as

town community members.
After listening to the college’s

concerns, Gail Biddison and Tom
Hier will make a recommendation

to the Facilities Planning Commit-
tee about the needs Davidson has
for a new union. This committee
will then make a recommendation
to Dr. Kuykendall based on the
consultant’s report, which is ex-
pected at the end of the semester,
combined with that of the Union
Planning Committee, chaired by
Dr. Sally McMillen.

The next step involves the
Board of Trustees. Assuming they
then approve the unknown recom-
mendation, the school would take
steps to collect the funds to finance
the new or renovated facilities.

Dr. John Kelton, Director of
Institutional Research and Chair
of the Facilities Planning Commit-
tee, says, “Yes, it is possible that
some current students would see
the results.” But he emphasizes
the uncertainty ofthe process which
depends on financial contributions.

Location and function were
two of the primary concerns ad-
dressed at the meeting with the
SGA and Union Board Wednes-
day-night.

Students mentioned a variety
of places on campus which would
be accessible for study breaks from
the library, for time between
classes, and for social options.
Many voiced the need for improved
student office facilities and in-
creased comfortable study areas.

The consultants “will pull all
viewpoints together to inform those
who are talking about a Union re-
garding programs, activities, the
role in social and academic life,”
says Kelton. He encourages any-
one interested in contributing ideas
to submit their suggestions to his
office on the first floor of Cham-
bers,

alumni from different career fields
in the Charlotte area.

Most students at the fair were
upperclassmen. The students found
the fair to be well organized and
helpful. Junior Mary McCrory
enjoyed the fair saying she was
“more comfortable there than at a
regular job fair” because only
Davidson students were there.
Complaints about the fairincluded
the hopes of more careers being

‘represented in the future, such as

law.

The alumni were eager to talk
to students about their jobs, their
major at Davidson, and possible
summer internships.

They were also eager to give
students advice on what to do to
get hired. One alum claimed she
was hired straight out of Davidson

because she had shown diversity-
she had maintained her GPA while
playing sports. Her major and her
summer jobs were not a major
asset.

Many of the alumni praised
the Career Office, encouraging stu-
dents to take advantage of the per-
sonality tests, computer programs,
and alumni networking that the
Careers Office offers.

This fair is only one of the
many activities the Career Office
plans for Davidson students. Up-
coming events include a pre-law
society dinner meeting, speakers,
and afternoon sessions about what
one can do with their major.

The Career Office publishes a
newsletter, provides counselling,
suggests internships, and much
more.

TV lounges's latest craze happens on "Melrose Place"

Students seem to
watch popular
show because of
different lifestyle
it portrays.

By Lexy Devane

There is a question plaguing
the minds of many. Why has the
number of Davidson students
spending their Wednesday nights ,
watching "Melrose Place" reached
epic proportions?

For those who are not familiar
with this 90210-for-the-mature-
viewing-audience, "Melrose
Place" surrounds the turmoil and
triumphs of eight twenty-some-
things living in a trendy apartment
complex in Los Angeles.

Nothing too out of the ordi-
nary for the ‘92- ‘93 premiere sea-
son packed with other such situ-

ational shows.

Why then did "Melrose Place"
earn a permanent place in the pop
icon culture when a similar show,
"The Heights", with such a nifty
theme song/top ten hit, “How Do
You Talk To An Angel,” got can-
celed after its firstshowing? What
is it with "Melrose Place"?

One reoccurring answer to
why "Melrose" is particularly
popular revolves around sex,
mainly in the romantic relation-
ship between roommates and best
friends Allison (Courtney
Thornton-Smith) and Billy (An-

drew Shue).

Many Davidson students say
this couple is the reason the show
has such a wide viewing audience;
they represent to many an "ideal
relationship."

Kate Evans says, “I will never
forget how fast the library cleared
and lounges filled at the season
finale of ‘Melrose’ during exam
week last year. Of course, I was
part of the rush because Billy and

Allison were going to finally hook
up.”

Erika Gromleski agrees, stat-
ing, “Basically, the reason people
watch "Melrose Place" is to watch
Andrew Shue. Andrew Shue walk.
Andrew Shue talk. Andrew Shue
breathe....”

A majority of students watch
the show because it contrasts to
their lives at Davidson.

“The characters on 'Melrose
Place’ do not lead more realistic or
necessarily better lives than the
average student. However, they

: ” States
Allison Sable.

She continues, “The show
makes me feel like my life isn’t all
that stressful. For example, during
last week’s episode, there was a
jealous boyfriend, a psychotic ex-
boyfriend, an attempted rape, the
beginnings of a divorce, an adul-
terous affair, a firing, and a tramp
hitting on another tramp’s man.
Maybe my huge calculus test isn’t
all that bad after all.”

Rhett Ingerick agrees with
Sable because “it is the one thingin
my life that does not require me to
think. Quality and meaningful lines
such as ‘I’ll do all the work, I
always do’ -and no, they are not
talking about their careers- are a
nice contrast from the literature
that the average Davidson student
reads for Class.”

Even Patterson Court has fol-
lowed suit in the craze. -Last year
Warner Hall hosted a "90210"/
"Melrose Place" party .

This year the Kappa Sig apart-

‘every Wednesaay so at 9 p.m.

with a plethora of young women
accompanying its inhabitants.

Ananonymous brother present
at all these gatherings says, “The
reason the show has its appeal is
because it playson our age group’s
interest in sex.

"The cast is full of attractive
individuals leading lives more ex-
citing than the average Davidson
student’s."

Installing Voice Mail

Voice continued from pagel

of people called frequently. This
feature will save professors, advi-
sors, and sports coaches a lot of
time by eliminating the need to
relay messages.

One of Davidson’s main at-
tractions is its helpful and friendly
atmosphere, according to
Stephenson. He emphasizes that
the move to a computerized sys-
tem does not represent a move
away from this spirit.

He hopes that the system will
take some of the time and hassle
out of “mundane tasks” like taking
and returning messages so that sec-

retaries, professors, and adminis-
trators can spend more time help-
ing people. Vivian Davis willcon-
tinue to operate the college switch-
board, and callers will always have
access to a human voice.

The college is very pleased
with the Octel system which was
chosen from several bids and is
being purchased on a five year
lease program. An Octel represen-
tative stressed that bidding was
very competitive and that Davidson
got “a very good deal.” The sys-
tem will be installed between Oc-
tober 15 and 19 while students are
on Fall Break.

women.

Although 85% of the partici-
pants stated that they felt safe when
walking on campus at night, 56%
expressed fear that they could be-
come a victim of some sort of
crime.

When asked how this issue
affected their decisions to come to
Davidson, 47% responded that it
was either a “big factor” or “con-
sidered.”

Approved changes include the
addition of new lampposts in areas
such as the section between Oak
and Elm Rows, the road in front of

Baker Sports Complex, and the
walkway next to Richardson Dorm.
Added floodlights will service the
large area in front of Chambers
Building.

Thecollege will alsouse lights
already in place around Richardson
Field to increase lighting for the
track and basketball courts at night.

Orr admits that he is unsure of
an exact date for the completion of
this work. He says that the physi-
cal plant is currently involved in
the repair of damages caused by an,
electrical storm atthe beginning of
the semester. It can devote only a
limited number of its staff mem-
bers to the project at this time butis
working to make the changes as
soon as possible.
