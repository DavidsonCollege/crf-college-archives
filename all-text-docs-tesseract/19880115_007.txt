Wrestling falls in

By HOLME OLTROGGE

Within one week, the Davidson
wrestling team competed in two
meets. On Wednesday night (Jan
6) the squad hosted Olivet Naza-
rene from Illinois, which was on
tour through the Southeast.

In the meet. against Olivet,
Davidson’s Holme Oltrogge, Holt
Foster, and co-captain Tim
Heinze took forfeits at the 118,
150, and 177 pound weightclasses
respectively. Unfortunately,
Davidson in turn gave up two
forfeits at 126 and 190, where
Matt McConnell was still.out due
to shoulder injuries. Foster and
Heinze also wrestled exhibition
matches; Foster barely won his
match 9-8, while Heinze lost toa

Around the Horn

‘Rucker at the Line”

By HAP BRYANT
The outlook wasn’t brilliant
For the Wildcat Five that night;
They trailed by 5 big points
With 30 seconds left in sight.

But, with the hope that springs eternal

Within the human breast,

The crowd still thought with Rucker

They’d pass this one stiff test.

Dylan Glenn (134) and Joe
Binns (142) could do nothing as
they fell to their opponents. Co-
captain. Sherb Sentell likewise
dropped his match at 158, despite
a great start. Newcomer Chris
Hargrove (167) gave a tremen-
dous effort before being pinned in
his first collegiate match. Not-so-
heavy Aengus Channon tried to
pick on someone 50 pounds over
his weight and twice as big
around, but to no avail.

Again on January 13, the Cats
traveled to Greenville, SC tomeet

conference rival Furman. The

team fared much better, falling
only 18-31. Big wins came from
freshmen Joe Binns (142) and

Holt Foster (150). Binns —
wrestled consistently to
win 13-5. Foster shut out
his opponent and scored
enough to win by a techni-
cal fall.

Co-captains Heinze and
Sentell also beat their oppo-
nents. Heinze won by for-
feit, but also beat a 190
pounder in an exhibition
match. Sentell handily de-
feated his opponent in a6-3
match.

Unfortunately, the Wild-
cats.gave up too many for-
feits. Starting 18 points in
the hole, the team could not
sufficiently make up the

He let fly a long one, Now he sprinted down the court

The Herd had not won yet, With Skippy on his tail; So he marched onto the court,

The Miners’ sons cried loud The former thinking M.V.P., With mind atuned to the rim;

When it hit the strand of net.. The latter doomed to fail. Himes thought, “If he misses this,
I’li tear him limb from limb.”

The Cats still trailed by two, Then Derek drove into the lane,

And Skippy had the ball; From whence he took his shot; But not this time or place

With only ten seconds left, But Skippy crushed him from behind, For Rucker hit the throw,

It seemed he had it all. And the zebra marked the spot. And Skippy went back to Marshall

But Huckaby called for time--

With a thousand losers in tow.

The shot went through the net

Oh, if Derek Rucker What an idiot he seemed-- And thus it tied the score; ~ As the Herd fell down to second,
Could get a shot in time, He thought Rucker had touched the line, | Then Rucker had a shot, Their ego bubble burst;
They’d bet their Daddy’s B-mers And the refs had hosed his team. To get us one point more. The Ne’er Defeated Wildcats.
With Rucker at the line. Retook their spot in first.
So, with seven left to play, So Huckaby called his last T.O.
And so, when Hunter missed a shot, The Herd had to make a pass; With 2 seconds on the clock, [As for this little verse,
And Magic did the same, But against the Davidson Cats, Hoping to ice the shooter Thanks go to Mighiy Casey,
A discontented yell went up It would be old Skippy’s last. And make the game a lock. I’dhave thought up my own rhyme scheme,
From the students at the game. Had not I been so lazy.)
When Skippy hit the ball, But Rucker sat, he wasn’t phased
But Hunter made a steal, Tom Curry moved to him; By this ignorant ploy;
Then passed to top of key, But Rucker darted in front, He thought, “When I hit this one,
Where Rucker stood awaiting And snatched it from his limb. The crowd will scream with joy.”
To pull another three.

IMAC Report

Forget NCAA basketball

By MATT TERRELL
Forget the Tarheels and the

Blue Devils. When did they learn.

| toplay basketball in Arizona any-
way? Who needs Fennis Dembo
when , in our own Johnston Gym,
IMAC basketball is in motion?
Yes, folks, you guessed it--the
hallowed hall of hoops is alive
once again with the sound of drib-
bling basketballs, whistles blow-
ing, and more often than not, refe-
ree baiting. Shh, the sounds of
IMAC basketball.

The 1987-88 campaign kicked
in December 2nd and is scheduled
to run through February 17th, the
night of the Championship. The
field looks strong this year with 6
women’s teams, 16 men’s A-
league teams, and 33 men’s B-
league teams. With 55 teams in
competition, it’s no wonder

| Davidson weeknights see the stu-
dents clad in their sweats and

high-tops.

The men’s A-league has seen a
few teams emerge from early
season play unscathed. Through
last ‘week’s play, four teams,
“Cool Breeze of BSC, “King
Cobra” of SAE, “Raji and Mate’s
Chairbreakers” of KA, and the
“Sweatjammers” of KA, re-
mained undefeated.

As is common with A-league
play, the scores have been high
and the teams competitive. Look
for a great season with even the
sixteenth place team being a force
to be reckoned with.

Women’s league play has been
seldom (three rescheduled
games), but the perennial power,
the “Insatiables,” and the
“Clueless Freshmen” top the
standings thus far with undefeated
marks. The “Insatiables” appear
impressive with one 54-point vic-
tory. The “Clueless Freshmen,”

having played only two games,
have been strong with 20- and 27-
point victories. The contest be-
tween the two teams should prove
a battle.

Men’s B-league play has seena
bit more parity with only four
teams of the thirty-three unde-
feated. “Chips Ahoy” of SPE top
Division I. Division II sees
“‘Where’s Lenny?” emerging as
the lone leader. In Division II,
“Slagle’s Bagels” prove unde-
feated with two games under their
belt.

“Cooters Nest” heads up Divi-
sion IV. After a slew of close
games (how about the “Goofy
Heads” over the “Damned Co-
manches” 16-15), the upcoming
continuation looks to be a dandy.

IMAC is once again in full
swing, and the court looks strong.
Look for an exciting season tour-
ney down in the Johnston Gym.
