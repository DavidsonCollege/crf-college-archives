CHEERLEADERS IN ACTION
Governed By “Flexible” Rules

Dave Powell Defends
Cheerleading Squad

By BOB TRAVERS
Davidsonian Staff Writer
Head cheerleader Dave Powell this week termed
rules about cheerleaders’ attendance at athletic events
“real flexible” and explained, ‘‘We don’t practice because

our cheers are so simple.”
When questioned about recent
criticism of the squad, he ad-
mitted, ‘It does look real bad
when they don't show up. I prob-
ably should be a little harder on
them, but it's been a lot better
this year then in the past."

“LOT WORSE”
‘There have been games when
attendance was a lot worse than

mains a cheerleader as long as
he is at Davidson. “I think it’s
a good system,’ Powell said.
“It insures a certain amount of
continuity—yet al the same time
the squad gets new members
each year.”

In the face of criticism, Pow.

ell pointed out that several of
~the cheerleaders had gone out of
their way to cheer at games in

that,"* commented Powell in ref- Gyartotte during, the Christmas

erence to Saturday's game with
VMI, which was attended by
only three of the eight regular
cheerleaders.

“One. fraternity had a party
Saturday night,"' explained Pow-
ell. Fortunately sophomore Skip
Balsley and freshman John
Passmore subbed for two of the
missing regulars. ‘“‘When we
have substitutes, they're usually
pretty good.’’ Powell added,
‘sometimes better than ‘the reg-
ulars.” .

Aside from Captain Powell,
currently leading the cheering
at Johnston Gymnasium are sen-
iors Tommy Hunter. Champ
Cavington and Randy McKnight:
juniors Buddy Durham and Dave
McCorkle: sophomore Gresh
Bayne, and freshman K.
Weeks.

ELECTIONS
Two rising seniors, one junior
and one sophomore are elected
cheerleaders each year. Each re-

vacation and at the Wake For-

est game during semester break.

“The cheerleaders attend the
games that most students miss,”’
he said.

IMPORTANCE

Despite recent criticism. the
cheerleaders are no doubt more
important to the crowd than to
the. team.

Basketball Coach Lefty Drie-
sell noted that whereas the
crowd's sentiments have an im-
portant effect on the team, the
efforts of the cheerleaders prob.
ably aren’t too significant. ‘‘I
think they've done a good job,”
Driesell commented.

Davidson's athletes probably
agree with one member of the
basketball team who said he re-

* ally doesn’t notice what is go-

ing on in the crowd.

“Still,” as one student said,
“having a couple of good cheer-
leaders helps you to enjoy a
game more.”

“i sented to the student body by

‘| Student Council President Bill

Council and Honor Court Chair-

|man Jim Stokes in chapel Tues:
day.

If passed, the first proposed
jamendment will change Article
V, Section 5 of the Student Body

a Constitution to read, “Trial pro-

cedure shall be determined by
the Honor Court and made avail-
able to the student body. This
shall include an investigation
committee of three members
elected by the Student Council

and a defense advisor elected by

the student body: who shall per-
form their. duties as prescribed
in the Honor Court procedure.”

The second proposal provides
for insertion of the word “‘ordi-
narily” into the Honor Code,
Article VII, Section 5. This arti-
cle would then read, “Every stu-
‘dent found guilty of violating any
section of this article shall ordi-
narily. be dismissed from the col-
lege.”

The third proposed amend.
ment reads as follows, ‘Article
TI, Section 2 of the Constitution
shajl be deleted as it now reads
and shall be replaced by an
article which shall read: ‘The
purpose of the Honor Court shall
be to encourage and maintain
the honor of the student body.

“Since Davidson strives to be
a Christian college and thus re-

cognizes both a concern for un-
derstanding and compassion as

‘well as for justice and honor, the

Court shall implement’ its pur-
pose through instilling in the stu-
dent body an awareness of the
basic principles of honor,
through administering the Hon-
or System and through enforc-
ing its decisions ag it sees fit in
the light of each individual

one

case.

In order for a proposed amend-
ment to the Constitution to be
presented to the student body,
it’ must either be presented to
the Student Council by a petition
signed by 50 students, or it must
pass a vole of the Student Coun
cil by a two-thirds majority.

The first and third proposals
to be voted upon Tuesday were
drawn up by the Honor Court
and were passed unanimously by
the Student Council in its meet-
ing Mofday night.

The second proposal. was pre-
sented to the Student Council
with the required 50 names.

All three proposals now have
the backing of Honor Court
Chairman Jim Stokes, who said
in Tuesday's chapel ‘'I urge you
to vote favorably for each of
them as I feel it would signifi-
cantly strengthen the Honor Sys-
tem.”

The proposals will be voted
upon separately, with a two-
thirds majority of those voting
necessary to pass each proposal.

Polls will be open from 8:30

YMCA Encourages
Payment Of Pledges

The Davidson YMCA ‘Great
Guy” campaign, which was held
predominantly on Oct. 14, is still
about $700 short of collecting all
its pledges.

On Oct. 14, about $4400 was
either contributed or pledged by
Davidson students and faculty to
the YMCA for the year 1965-66.

Through signs and posters on
campus, the Y officers are try-
ing to encourage all those who
have not .fulflled their pledges
to do so as soon as possible at
the Y office on the second floor
of the Union. The pledges were
due Jan 1.

Although they do not want to
go to the students’ room to col-
lect the pledges, the officers
may have to resort to this
method eventually. If a student
is not sure whether he has ful
filled his pledge, he may check
the record in the Y office.

Joe Jelks, vice president of the
YMCA and director of the cam-
paign, emphasized “how pleased
we are with the enthusastic at-
tiude that students have shown
toward this drive."’ He feels that
the money which has been con.
tributed ‘‘will strengthen the
organization so that students can
benefit more from it.”

platform statement is not to ex-
ceed 250 words. .
PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES

Campbell stressed that ‘‘at
next week's Social Council meet-
ing. prospective candidates will
be expected to convince the So-
cial. Council of their ability to do

devote the time and effort .re-
quired.” There will be’ no set
maximum number of candidates,
although the Social Cotincil wil!
narrow the field.

Campbell also requested that
students wishing to run for the
chairmanship sign up in his
room before Monday night.

Other provisions of the Social
Council election procedure are
that. the office -shall require a
rising senior, and that next
year’s treasurer Shall be elected

‘to incorporation into the Student
Body Constitution.

POLL

The results of Jast week's stu-
dent body poll concerning sched-
uling and review and exam pro
cedures were also presented at
‘the. Council meeting.

According to the student opin-
ion boll, 78 per cent of the stu
dent body favor a revised sched.
ule with no Saturday classes. If
Saturday classes do remain,
however, 52 per cent would favor
a straight morning schedule with
no chapel opening on Tuesday
Thursday Saturday, with chapel
being held.on Monday, Wednes
day, and Friday.

COURSE DROPPING

Three-fourths of the students
felt. that the present period al-
lowed to drop a course was in-

r—

adequate, with 70 per cent of
them favoring a one-month peri-
od.

More than 90 per cent express-
ed a preference for faculty han-
dling of re-exam and review
makeup schedules rather than
the Dean of Students Office.

Also, 60 per cent favored a
schodule enabling first semester
exams to end before Christmas,
while 80 per cent backed chang:
ing the spring break’ to include
Eastef weekend.

In other Student Council ac-
tion, the Kuykendal! petition con-
cerning Honor Court procedures
was presented to the Council by
Jim Stokes, Honor Court chair-
man, who worked with George
Kuykendall in revising the orig-
inal petition.

The Council approved for a
student referendum the portions
of Kuykendall’s petition which
had been changed by agreement
of Kuykendall and the Honor
Court.

IFC Sets Greek Week,

Limits Pledge Training

By RON SNOW
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The ‘Interfraternity Council. in
accordance with faculty rules,
voted Monday night to terminate
pledge training programs at the
end of Greek Week, April 8.

Greek Week will begin.the first
day after spring break, April 4,
and continue until 5 p.m. April
8. A banquet for.the pledges will
probably be held sometime dur-
ing the first part of the week.
David Westfall, Pi Kappa Phi
representative, was appointed
chairman of the Greek Week
Committee.

The decision to terminate
pledge training’ at the end of
eight: weeks is in direct conflict
with the national rules of three
fratérnities that require a pledge
period of three months.

EXTENSION
Tom Covington, fraternity 1i-
aison officer, said that in those
cases where this rule could not
be waived by the national fra-
ternity in question, an extension

problem.

N. C.. LAW

The law states: “It shall be
unlawful for any student to en-
gage in what is known as haz-
‘ing. Hazing is defined as fol-
lows: ‘To annoy any student by
playing abusive or ridiculous
tricks upon him; to frighten,
scold, beat or harass ‘him; or to
subject him to personal indig-
nity.” Any violation of this act
shall constitute a misdemeanor.

“Upon conviction of any stu-
dent of the offense of hazing. he
shall, in addition to any punish-
ment imposed by the court be
expelled from the college or
school he is attending. The fac-
’ulty or governing board of that
school charged with the duty of
expulsion of students shall expel
the offender, and failire to do
so shall be a misdemeanor.”

handled," Martin continued.

“Most of the time was spent
discussing the curriculum
changes to be made. This part-
icular matter had to be settled
at this meeting, as it was the
last one before the catalogue
deadline."

Martin added that he did not
think the faculty had expected
to complete discussion Tuesday
on the committee’s recommen-
dations, anyway.

A special meeting at which the
faculty will consider the pro-
posals has been planned ten-
tatively for Feb. 23.

When asked if he thought the
faculty would reach a decision
on the recommendations when
they next meet. Martin replied,
“Based on my experience, I
don't know. It is unlikely that
we'll get conipletely through
with the matter, and we might
have to have another meeting.”

Dr. Martin said that the drag-
Hing on of the debate on what
action the college should take
regarding the fraternity issue. is
an indication of the seriousness
of the problem.

He further stated that the ap-
proach in the committee's re-
port is a relatively new one. and
that it may be a healthy: situa-
tion for a faculty decision not to
have come .out of one meéeting.

“Time and thought are neces-
sary, although some are im-
patient for action."

Covington said that he feels
that this year’s freshmen are
suited to a more concentrated

programs of the past which last-

Covington expressed much con-
cern over the hazing that re-
portedly takes place as a part

\lof rhany ‘pledge programs and

emphasized that it would not be
tolerated. He dug into the Con-
solidated Statutes of the State of

day, changed its recommenda-
tion of 100 per cent bidding to
one of 100 per cent ‘‘affiliation.”

“The original was plainly un-
palatable to most fraternity men,
and some members of the com-
mittee felt that it would not
draw much cooperation from the
fraternities," remarked Dr. W.
G. Workman, committee chair-
man, this week.

“After meeting wth the fra-
ternity presidents last Friday,
the committee voted to widen
the range of possible connection
with a fraternity,” he said.

“If the new proposal is ap-
proved by the faculty,’ Work-
man continued, “the decision on
the specific kind of affiliaton
would be in the hands of the fra-
ternities of the IFC.”

The new _ recommendation
states that the IFC should sub-
mit to the Faculty Committee on
Fraternities, Clubs and Social
Life by March, 1967, a workable
plan whereby every freshman so

desiring to be given opportunity
for affiliation with a fraternity.

The range of affiliation to be
considered. shall be from what is
now meant by “social affiliate”
to what is now meant by ‘“‘mem-
ber’ or ‘‘brother.”’

This plan would go into effect
for rush during 1967-68.

The only restriction on the na-
ture of the plan would be that
in such a system every student
should be given the opportunity
of remaining affiliated for at
least one year with the ordinari-
ly permitted social and eating
privileges of the house.

The former recommendation
stated that every freshman de-
siring a bid should get one, and
that-he should be allowed to re-
main a pledge for at least a
year.

Dr. Workman emphasized that
the present form of the proposal
makes possible the adoption of
its earlier form, while giving
greater leeway to the frater-
nities.

The committee also voted to
have its proposed restrictions
on contact between freshmen
and upperclassmen apply only
during Monday through Friday
of each week.
