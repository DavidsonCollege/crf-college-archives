We’re the Wild-cats, not the Sedate-cats

Picture the typical Davidson
Wildcats men’s basketball game.
Inone section, students are on their
feet yelling, cheering, and making
noise. To their immediate left are
the Helen Kellers of Belk Arena—
those who sit quietly, clap occa-
sionally, and quietly pass judge-
ment on the game before them.
The latter is how fans at any Divi-
sion I basketball game should act,
according to Ken May’s article
“Settle Down, Crazy Cats!” We
disagree.

In this article, Ken implies
that the Crazy Cats are just too
loud and slandering for our South-
em, conservative college. Guess
what — we’re the WILD-cats, not
the SEDATE-cats. Shouldn’t our
fans display the same wild enthu-
siasm and spirit that our players
and coaches display on and off the

court? Our players and coaches
are working hard to make their
programs the best in the country,
so why don’t we support them in
any way we can to help them
achieve this goal? How many Duke
fans, a.k.a. the “Cameron Crazies,”
go to games for a nice sport like
synchronized swimming or lawn
bowling? College basketball is the
biggest and loudest spectator sport
in America, and it didn’t get that
way by genteel cheering.

Ken also states that our spec-
tators should cheer for those
“highly trained athletes who grace
Belk Arena,” such as Frankie King
or Randolph Childress. We agree,
they are good players, but we have
the same hard-working, dedicated
players right here at Davidson who
deserve the same, if not more, ap-
preciation and admiration than the

“big-name” players get. Are we
supposed to go to the game to
watch Frankie or Randolph and
not be awed by our own players
who are of equal or better caliber?
Do you know which college had
the NCAA Division I scoring per-
centage leader last year? Not UNC
Chapel Hill, not UMass, not Wake
Forest, but Davidson. Davidson’s
own George Spain. We think that
deserves our awe and admiration.

It was Jermaine Parker, the
UNC Charlotte center, who in the
Charlotte Observer on December
17, 1994, said, “We pretty much
treat it [Belk Arena] as a neutral
court.” The embarrassment is not
that the Crazy Cats are obnoxious
orloud. The embarrassment is that
teams enter Belk Arena with that
“neutral court” mindset, simply
because Davidson fans follow

Evolution

from page 6

what I am asking for.

My reason for writing the
article and my basic thesis behind
it is that science is based on fact—
not faith. However, evolution re-
quires the faith normally relegated
by science to religion. My whole
point is that the theory of evolution
is being taughtas fact in the schools
and has become a central idea in
society, just like Christianity was
several hundred years ago. But
unlike Christian ideas, evolution is
based on science, which is based
on facts, not faith. I doubt I will be
able to convince everyone of the
flaws in evolution. My purpose
was to point out that there are flaws
which are never addressed when it
is taught. Something with as many
flaws as evolution, or something
that cannot be reproduced in a lab
(which is normally required be-
fore something is accepted by sci-
ence) should not be taught as fact.
It is. That is wrong.

Sincerely,
Eric Sapp ’98

PRESIDENT
BILL
CLINTON

Ken’s lead. Whatis the purpose of
a home court advantage when the
fans only clap politely as if they
were watching a golf tournament?
The embarrassment for Davidson
fans is that few cheer for their
school and many lack the spirit
that the Crazy Cats promote.
Davidson is a big-time basketball
program that depends on its stu-
dents for support.

Askany playerorcoach which
they prefer: a polite clapping crowd
or a loud, gym-rocking crowd that
other teams fear playing before.
We dare to say that Coach
McKillop and his Wildcats would
prefer the latter. The players want
to know their school, their fans, are
supporting them one hundred per-
cent.

Ken concludes by saying, “If
not for the sake of opponents,

Davidson’s reputation, or my ear-
drums — for your own sakes, do
yourself a favor: act your age and
SHUT UP!” We repeal and re-
verse Ken’s advice. Change the
reputation of Davidson fans by
cheering wildly for your Wildcats,
keeping the refs on their toes, and
taunting the opponent.

Ken and his crowd can learn a
few things from Davidson’s most
dedicated fans, the Pines commu:
nity. Half the college has less
spirit than the Pines section, unless
it’s the last five minutes of a close
game. How many students bother
to even wear the school’s colors,
let alone hand-knit sweaters that
are the pride of every Pines fan?

Atourhome games, we would
much rather have a red-sweatered
Pines sections than a white-gloved
Ken May section.

Is there a crisis in black

leadership?

In Race Matters, Cornell West
brings up the question of African-
American leadership and answers
resoundingly with: “There has not
been a time in the history of black
people in this country when the
quantity of politicians and intel-
lectuals was so great, yet the qual-
ity of both groups has been so
low.”

He goes on to cite the lack of
genuine humility and authentic
anger among blacks. West sees a
shortage of black individuals who
are upset with the state of black
people everywhere. Is there a
need for such leadership?

What is leadership? What is
black? What is black leadership?
Leadership simply implies the abil-
ity or capacity to lead. Defining
blackness is more difficult, and
this is where such an argument
may break down. Being black
doesn’t (shouldn’t) force you to
act or think in a certain way.

The diversity in the black race
is greater than we can imagine.

. We are rappers, opera singers,

country singers, and rock stars.’
We are dancers, rodeo riders,
hockey players, golfers, and movie
stars. We are violent, non-violent,
mild, genuine, and superficial. We
are beautiful and ugly. We are
black and white. We do not all
believe in affirmative-action and
civilrights. And yes, we are Demo-
crats and Republicans. ;

So why should we expect lead-
ership within such a diverse group?
I believe we should never forfeit
our diversity because this is the
true strength of our culture. We
mustremember, however, that true
individuality will only be achieved
through collective effort. Due to
circumstances beyond ourcontrol,
we have not been individuals for
over 400 years. This is where
black leadership should be defined.

It should be defined through
fighting a common enemy, dis-
crimination on basis of color.

Discrimination is the one thing

that binds us together and tears us
down simultaneously. Discrimi-
nation hits in the poorest and rich-
est neighborhoods. It affects light-
skinned and dark-skinned blacks.
Ithits stereotypical blacks and not-
so-stereotypical blacks. It affects
the Louis Farrakhans, Jesse

‘Jacksons, Mayou Angelous, and

the Tony Morrisons. So why
shouldn’ tall of these areas hit back?

We have been hitting back, so
effort is not the true problem of
black leadership. The problem
comes from a lack of a collective
effort to fight. I find that we have
been too busy trying to be indi-
viduals in a world that has yet to
allow us to become such. Some
try to claim a monopoly on black-
ness, while others try to forget about
blackness.

These groups must find a way
to work in conjunction with, and
not against, one another. When
will we see the likes of Louis
Farrakhan and Jesse Jackson work-
ing together? This doesn’t seem
realistic because we did not see
much of it with Martin and
Malcolm. We have to learn to
struggle together.

We struggle to be free, yet fail
to realize that freeing one is not
possible. Freedom will come ina
collective sense and not on an indi-
vidual basis. Black leadership is in
crisis, not from a lack of effort, but
rather from a lack of understand-
ing.

The irony is incredible; we
must forget about our personal
goals of individualism to become
just that, INDIVIDUALS.

"No matter how much respect,
no matter how much recognition
whites show towards me, as far as
I’m concerned, as long as it is not
shown to every one of our people
in this country, it doesn’t exist for
me.” —Malcolm X
