EDITORIAL.

A SUGGESTED REMEDY. ,

» The universal lack of interest in the
“Davidson College Magazine” seems to
prove that it is doomed to permanent
failure unless some way can be devised
by which interest can be created in that
publication. We know, to our certain
knowledge, that no effort has been
spared by the editors of the Magazine to
make it attractive, and yet it is no secret
that it is practically impossible to secure
contributions, and then, that hardly any
of these contributions are read.

A suggested remedy would be for the
Magazine to be taken in hand by the
members of the Junior class and handled
by them in-much the same manner as the
Annual is by the Senior class. By the
time a man has reached the Junior class
he is ready for responsibilities, and the
class should be ready to take over some
regular work. We have too much o | the
tendency at Davidson to wait until a
man has reached his Senior year, and
then give him more work -than he can
handle—simply because someone in the
Senior class must fill the places. Man
after man is only marking time in the
Junior class, when in many ways, this
should be the best year of his college
course.

Then again, the Magazine, with the
present reduced number of issues, is not
a great financial undertaking, and the
united support of a class would easily
put it on a paying basis. In this way.
we would have a training ground for
the men who will later go into the other
publications on the campus. At the same
time, we would have a medium through
which the Junior class could give ex-
pression to its individuality and thus gain
the added power which goes with hav-
ing “accomplished something.”
