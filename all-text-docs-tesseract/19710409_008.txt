Wilkerson Wants “To Stay In Action’

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

Why would anyone want to
be a catcher for a college
baseball team?

According to Harold Wilker-
son, catcher for the Wild:
cats, it’s for the power.

“T'm always in the center
of the action,’ Wilkerson
said, ‘‘and I get to call all
the action in the infield.”

The catcher is responsible

for deciding what pitch will.

work best against a batter
and for calling infield plays.
Wilkerson, who says he has
been a catcher all his life,
has been behind the plate for
Davidson for three ears.
Last summer, Wilkerson
played on an amateur team
in Arlington, Va., that was
part of an area-wide league

Scott ToInstitute
Changes In P.E.

Several major alterations
in the present physical edu-
cation program at Davidson
may begin next year, accord-
ing to Tom _ Scott, direc-
tor of athletics.

Scott said that there will
be a major evaluation of the
program to be presented to
the Educational Policy Com-
mittee April 23.

The first suggested change
will be the institution of “‘pro-
ficiency tests’’ for students
taking P. E.

A proficiency test will de-
termine whether a_ student
has a basic understanding
of a sport, including: funda-
mentals, rules, strategy and
history.

‘Passing a certain test will
allow a student to exempt
‘a gym course while receiving
credit in that subject.

Scott said that the tests
may also be used to set out-
lines for subjects to be
taught in a term.

According to the plan, an
entering freshman could pos-
sibly pass
tests and exempt
requirements.

The second major change
will be in the years a student
is required to take P. E.

‘Although there. will be no
change in the actual amount
of time that will be required
the system will be structur-
‘ed so that a student may
fulfill his tequirement any-
time during his four years
at Davidson.

all “‘@ym

six proficiency

This would change the pre-
sent requirement from fresh
man and sophomore years
to six credits over four years.

“We are not interested in
gym simply so students will
get .exercise,”’ Scott ‘said,
“but we wish to teach skillg
that they will be able to use
later in leisure and busi
ness."

Scott said that art effort

would be made to reem-
phasize sports such as hand
ball and golf.
_ ‘We also have started sev-
eral programs which will
help students towards get-
ting summer jobs, such as
Water Safety Instructor and
first aid programs.”

Scott said that he did not
foresee any expansion of the
present program, for ‘‘there
was little else they could
cover.”

At present there are 18
different subjects taught in
the physical education pro-
gram.

for players 19 years old or
younger,

His team placed second in
the nation in that age group.

“Sometimes my experience
last summer affects miy play-
ing here, he said, “I was
catching for some very fine
pitchers and sometimes I get
upset with the — pitchers
here.’

He went on to compliment
Davidson's pitching,

Wilkerson is. optimistic
about the Wildcats’ chances —
in the Southern Conference
this year.

“Davidson has done poorly
in past years and most of
the teams expect the same
this year,’ he said. ‘But
we've got batters this year
that are going to hit against
any pitcher, no matter who
he is.”

Wilkerson does his share
towards embarrassing oppos-
ing*pitchers, hitting .339 in
14 games and driving in sev-
en runs,

In Monday's contest with
Pfeiffer, Wilkerson hit his
first home run of the season.

Davidson beat. Pfeiffer 4-1
with both Wilkerson and Jack
Willits hitting homers.

Ross Manire pitched his
first full game for the ‘Cats
and lowered his ERA from
6.75 to 2.08.

Last Saturday, Davidson
split a doubleheader with the
Spiders from the University
of Richmond.

Davidson won the first
game 11-4 with both Willits
and Rick Pipan, the pitcher,
hitting homers. They lost the
second 84.

Wilkerson said that he felt
the ‘Cats could last against /
any team they meet.

“T feel sure we've hit more
home runs than-any team in
the conference,’ he Said,
‘‘and we've been hitting well
from all parts of the lineup.”’

Tomorrow the Wildcats
will take on the Bulldogs ol
The Citadel in a double:
header here at Davidson.

Monday they will travel to
Guilford and then return to

meet UNC-Wilmingion here
on Wednesday.
Thursday ‘they will finish

out the week with a double-
header at conference power
Furman.

Scott also praised Rusty
Boyd, Davidson's medalist
with a 70 against State, and
the two freshmen on_ the
team, Spinner and Jim Ray.

Scott said both were fine
golfers. who had_ definitely
helped what he termed ‘“‘an
improved team.”

The two freshmen finished
second and = third behind
Clark in the Furman Invi-
tational.

Due to inclement weather
whieh caused ~ insufficient
pre-season practice, the re
sults have been satisfactory.

In_ fact. Scott stated only
one of the. seven members
shot over 80 against State.

The team is playing a
match today at Charlotte
Country Club against Tren
ton State, and next. week
meets North Carolina, one
of the better teams in this
area,

North Carolina finished
fourth in the Cape Coral In-
Vitiational  tournamert— in
Cape Coral, Fla.

Scott. called ‘this a “big
tournament” and said that
this is an indication of the
prowess of the. team. One
of the Carolina golfers shot
a 65 on the first day.

The site for the second
match with North Carolina
State has been changed. The
match was previously sched-
uled for Westport, but has
been changed to Fort Mill.
