Vesper Service Is

Conducted By Rev.
Melvin E. Trotter

Prominent Evangelist of Grand
Rapids Is Conducting Meet-
ings at Charlotte

BIG CROWD ATTENDS

Two Chicago Musicians Accom-
pany Speaker on Tour

Rev. Melvin E. Trotter, well-known
rescue mission worker and evangelist,
of Grand Rapids, Mich., was heard by
a large gathering of students at the
vesper service last Sunday evening. Ed
Humphreys of the Senior class was in
charge of the service. After reading
the Scripture, he called upon Wee
Thompson to lead in prayer.

Rev. Trotter's evangelistic party con-
sists of Mr. Homer Hammontree, of
Chicago, singer, and Paul Beckwith,
pianist, also of Chicago. Mr. Ham-
montree is well known in the South,
having been often in conferences in
South Carolina and Virginia, and has
been with Rev. Trotter 16cyears. He
announced that he would speak in
chapel Tuesday morning. Rev. Trotter
is conducting ,a series of services, last-
ing two weeks, at the First Presbyte-
rian Church of Charlotte and extended
an invitation to all students,

Rev. Trotter chose as his text Isaiah
43-25, “I, even I, am he that blotteth
out thy transgressions for my own
sake, and will not remember thy sins.”
Presenting his thoughts in an earnest
and forceful manner, he put them in
the form of an outline—“ Blotted out
of God’s own book,’—1 “By His own
hand,” 2, “For His own sake,” and 3,
“From*His own memory.” He stated
that there is a logical probability that
God keeps His records of our trans-
gressions in a manner comparable to
the impressionable records of Edison.
He illustrated this thought by the fol-
lowing story: “A young man was sus-
pected of having killed his father and
mother and stolen their money. The
police, after throwing him in jail, sum-
moned the“boy’s fiancee and asked
that she ask him two questions. She
was willing, believing him innocent.
She went to the boy and tried to con-
sole him. After talking with him of
many things, she asked him: ‘Why
did you kill them ’ The boy replied:
‘Because if I had the money I could
marry you.’ She said: ‘I'll keep your
secret.’ The next question was: ‘What
did you do with the money?’ He told
her and said it was for her. The girl
left without telling the officers the
answers to the questions. In court the
next day, during the boy’s trial, they

Local I. R. C. to Join
Winthrop in Meeting

In response to an invitation from
the president of Winthrop College, of
Rock Hill, S. C., the Davidson College
International Relations Club will join

with similar clubs from colleges of this’

and adjoining states in the fifth meet-
ing of the Model League of Nations
Assembly, to. be held on December 8
and 9. Representing Davidson will be
Gordon Brown, Fred Smyre and W. T.
Thompson.

The purpose of this unique assembly
is to acquaint American students with
the proceedings of the world-wide de-
liberative body—the League of Nations.
Each country in the league will be rep-
resented by at least three students, and
those ‘colleges which give early notice
of their willingness to send delegates
will be given the more important coun-
tries. The Davidson delegation is to
represent two countries, two of the
delegates representing Switzerland and
the remaining one, China.

Gordon Brown will deliver a con-
demnation of the German policy dur-
ing the sitting of the assembly, and
will later engage in debate with a rep-
resentative from the University of
North Carolina on the Japanese man-
date question in the Pacific.

Fred Smyre and W. T. Thompson
will receive instructions as to the ma-
terial for debate upon arrival at the
Winthrop campus.

Dr.T.W.Lingle Gives Opinion
Of Soviet Union Recognition

Believes That United States Has Ac
Diplomatic Relations

“The most conspicuous motiye pro-
moting recognition of Russia by the
United States is commerce, and I be-
lieve that our government acted wisely
in re-establishing diplomatic relations
with that nation,’ commented Dr. T.
W. Lingle, head of Davidson's history

department, when speaking to a Da-
vidsonian reporter concerning the
Soviet Union’s recognition by the

United States on November 17,

The Davidson professor remarked
that Russia’s recognition does not nec-
essarily imply thatcAmericans sanction
the form of government existing in. the
Soviet Union, nor the abuses charac-
teristic of it, but that similar condi-
tions are prevalent in various other
nations which have received recogni-
tion by our government.

Nevertheless, Russia apparently has
a durable form of government, pos-
sessing marked qualities of stability,
and performing the customary func-
tions of a governmental body over a
large territory. Thus the Soviet form

Acted Wisely in Re-establishing
With Soviet Russia

of rule measures up to the standards
set by the United States as vital for
recognition of our country.

Continuing, Dr. Lingle pointed out
that Americans often speak of their
intended exports to Russia, but that
very little is said of the expected im-
ports from that country. The sales of
the United States to the Soviets will
be limited, unless our government sup-
plies Russians the money with which
to pay American exporters, who will
naturally bring great pressure to bear
upon their government to supply credit
for Russia.

Moreover, it will eventually be nec-
essary for the American taxpayers to
assume the burden of the credit ex-
tended the Soviets, unless a balance of
trade is reached between 2 two na-
tions.

“After all,” concluded De Lingle,
“there is no such thing as sales on a
vast scale by one nation to another;
it must be international trade, not in-
ternational sale.”

Noted Brain Specialist
Lectures to Pre-Meds

At the invitation of the Pi Delta
Alpha pre-medical honorary fraternity,
Dr. T. D. Sparrow, of Charlotte, gave
a lecture last Friday night on the sub-
ject of brain injuries. The lecture was
given especially for the benefit of
medical students, but all those who
were interested in the subject were
invited.

Dr. Sparrow showed the group a
drawing of the brain, pointing out its
main divisions. He told of several
mistaken ideas about brain injuries
and of the effects on the brain of con-
cussion and fracturing of the skull,
Several instances in the doctor’s own
experience were given.

A skull prepared especially for dem-
onstration purposes was shown, and
the speaker pointed out how closely
the bones of the head fitted together
to protect the delicate brain enclosed.

Art: Renaissance and

Boroque”
Professor Edward S,. King, of
Princeton University, will give /llus-

trated lectures at Davidson on Mqnday
and Tuesday evenings, December 11
and 12, on “Italian Art: Renaissance

Y.M.C.A. Gift Fund
Will Go To Unity
Church This Year

“Y” Has Set Goal of One Thou-
sand Dollars in Its Drive for
Christmas. Funds

THREE-DAY CAMPAIGN

Students Will Be Offered Oppor-
tunity to Assist

The Christmas Gift Fund, sponsored
each year by the Davidson Y. M. C. A,,
will be given this year to the Davidson
Unity Church. Every member of the
student body will be given the oppor-
tunity to help out this little church of
the mill village.

It has been customary for several
years for the “Y” to offer the students
this opportunity to do some service.
By their contributions in the past, the
students have helped individuals both
here and in other places.

The campaign for the Christmas
Fund will be on Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday, December 11, 12, and 13.
During this time each man will be
reached individually by those conduct-
ing the campaign, in order to give the
students an opportunity to become ac-
quainted with the work their money
will do, and to see the real need for
their contributions. The “Y” has set
$1,000 as its goal, and the wholehearted
support of every student is needed to
reach the goal.

The Davidson Unity Church is the
outgrowth of the Mill Chapel which
was started several years ago by the
“Y" with the support of the Davidson
Presbyterian Church.

The pastors for this church are
members of the Davidson student
body, who give their whole time, aside
from school work, to the work of the
Unity Church. The men who are at
present student pastors are Sid Marsh
and Don Brandon. In addition to con-
ducting all of the regular church serv-
ices, these men have found time to do
a good deal of personal work among
the people of the mill district. Former
Davidson men who were student pas-
tors are John Howard, Albert McClure
and DeWitt Helm.

The Christmas Fund this year will
be used to pay the salary of the two
student workers. Thi§?will take ap-
proximately $200 of the fund. Part
will be used to alleviate cases of actual
want and suffering among the people
of the district, and to furnish them
with food, clothing and fuel. Another
part will be used to provide a medical
fund for emergency cases needing im-
mediate attention: There is still a bill
to be paid for the community shower
house built last year, and there are
several improvements to be made in
the church building. All that remains
will be put into a sinking fund to help
provide for needs in future years.

The. little church was started about
three or four years ago in a one-room
shack. After a short while a fund
was raised to build an addition to this

Wake Forest game, Davidson’s last of
the season, was a gala occasion. Much
spirit and enthusiasm was shown by all
those who attended, and the entire stu-
dent body was put on edge for the
game on Thursday,

group then assembled. in front of
Chambers, after a march through town.
The pep meeting was climaxed by a
snake dance by the freshmen around
a huge bonfire on the freshman field.

cheers. The band present and
helped the students in their cheering
by playing several stirring marches.

Davidson Places Third
In Big Five Percentage

Three of Five Touchdowns Come
as Result of Aerial
Heaves

DEACONS LEAD AT HALF

Mackorell and Morgan Star for
Home Team

Bringing to a close a season highly
successful in all respects, Davidson's
Wildcats defeated the Demon Deacons
of Wake Forest 20-13 last Thursday
in a hard-fought Turkey Day classic
staged in Central High Stadium, Char-
lotte.

By virtue of the victory, the ’Cats
took third place in the State Big Five
race, Duke and Carolina placing first
and second in the order named, and
Wake Forest and State being tied for
fourth,

The contest was featured by splendid
exhibitions of aerial warfare, both
teams tossing long passes with aban-
don, and three of the five touchdowns
coming as the result of aerial heaves.

Outplayed in the first half, and find-
ing it hard to get started, the Wild-
cats came back strong after intermis-
sion to push over one counter in the
third quarter and two in the fourth.

The Deacons were first to score,
making their first touchdown of the
season when a concentrated drive and
tw lengthy passes in the second canto
placed the ball.on Davidson’s six-yard
stripe, where two smashing dine plays
carried it over. The half ended with
the score 7 to 0.

But in the third quarter, Davidson’s

sagacious Johnny Mackorell, brilliant
friple-thrent quorterback, and unent
mous choice for All-State honors,

shoved the offensive into high gear,
and the ’Cats tallied their first counter
of the game by virtue of a spectacular
60-yard pass from Mackorell to Mor-
gan, Davidson end,

The Wildcats were on Wake’s 40-
yard line when Johnny took the ball
from center, faded back to the 50-yard
stripe, and whipped the long shot to
Morgan, who was just across the goal
line. The play was perfectly timed,
and “Big Jim,” who was playing his
best game of the season, caught the
ball while running at full speed. Wing-
field then kicked the extra point, tying
the score.

charging Morgan blocked a Deacon
punt and Charlie Fort,covered the ball

ophy and psychology fraternity, held
its regular monthly business meeting
on last Friday evening, December 1,
at 8:30 o'clock.

At the meeting, names of prospect-
ive members were submitted to those

Committee on Lectures was endeavor-
ing to secure Dr, Arps, dean of Ohio
State University, and one of the most
eminent psychologists in the country,
to address the student body some time
this winter. Dr. Hood was associated
with Dr. Arps in summer work at the
university,

for the January meeting. The query,
to be announced later, will relate to
some phase of psychology.

After the business meeting, refresh-

ments were served to the members.
