N.C. Fellows accept ten

The North Carolina Fellows have accep‘ed ten new members
from the Class of 1981. Three female and seven male students
were chosen from the finalists.

The new members are: Katherine Martin Allen; Kevin
Thomas Calderbank; John Staige Davis; David Lee Huie:
Bradford Michael Kerr; Edward Harman Lindsey; Lindsay
Gordon Robertson; James Albert Tholen; Margaret Ann
Tutwiler; Nancy Mann Wright.

The Senior Class Gift Committee will be conducting a fund
drive to buy a movie screen and establish a library book fund.

The new movie sereen for Love Auditorium will be wide
enough to handle Panavision movies. The screen costs $1350
which includes the lowering mechanism and installation
according to Jane Childs, the committee member who
researched it.

The Committee hopes to have it installed {and in use}
sometime during Spring term.

Counselors to be chosen

‘We are looking for people with two eyes, two hands and a
loud mouth,” Dean of Students Will Terry joked when asked
what he looked for in a hall counselor. He indicated that no

certain type or mind set was sought.

Hall counselors will be chosen next month on the basis of
essays and interviews with panels of freshmen, present
counselors and officials.

Each applicant will recieve two interviews between January
30 and February 8. The decisions should be announced the
following week.

The 65 applicants of this year’s sophomore class for 30
placements is about 20 less than last year.

Suggested reasons for the decrease in applications were the
JYA and Spring Term Abroad programs and the reluctance pf
students to make such an early and binding commitment for the
coming year. Also Terry said it was possibly not as publicized as
in previous years.

There has been a proportional number of male and female
applicants.

Freshman advisors Nancy Macconnachie and Doug Horn said.
that responsibility, willingness, and enthusiasm are traits
sought after in hall counselors.

Assistant Dean of Students Sue Ross added that the
counselors should serve as examples to the freshmen is both
budgeting study time and enjoying free time. They also had the
important task of introducing and explaining the codes of honor
and responsibility which govern the campus.

Dean Terry said the payment that hall counselors recieve is no
real compensation for the hours of effort put into the job, but
rather more of an honorarium. It is necessary for telephones and
a little spending money so counselors will not need an extra job.

Early Decision accepts 71

Seventf-one students were accepted for the fall of 1978 under
Davidson's Early Decision Plan. The number of early. decision
applicants was 112 students, equivalent to last year's figures.

Director of admissions H. Edmunds White explained that the
early applicants for the class of 1981, especially the female
students, were well prépared.

The College accepted 39 men and 32 women, the latter
comprising almost one third of the expected female total. White
stated ‘‘I would have been glad to have a few more men and a
few less women,”’ in reference to the large number of females yet
to be considered this spring.

The 16 men and 25 women who were not accepted will be
‘‘delayed for later consideration’ along with regular spring
applicants in aceordance with previous ‘policy.

Only two minority students applied under early decision and
both were a . White cited the small number of minority
applications as consonate with past years.

Unlike some schools, Davidson does not place more empnasis
on college board scores among early decision applicants than
among reguler applicants. Commuity involvement and acade-

«: Set for spring renovation

274
_By KIRBYOWEN ~

Staff Writer
With a total budget of

$800,000 the renovation of the
Martin Science building will
finally become a reality—the
repairs are scheduled to begin
spring term of this year.

The Martin renovation pro- -

ject is being funded in several
ways. It began with $200,000
of which $125,000 was donated
by R.J. Reynolds: the remain-
ing $75,000 was received from
numerous other donors. In
October 1977, the science de-
partment received a challenge
grant from the Charles A.
Dana Foundation. .

The grant was for a total of
$200,000 but it can only be
-claimed if double that amount,
$400,000 is raised by October
1978. 1f the $400,000 is raised.
then the $200,000 challenge
grant can be claimed. which
when added to the original
$200,000 provides a budget of
$800,000.

To date, with $500,000 (in-
cluding the challenge grant) in
hand, the half-way mark has
already been surpassed for the

_ total amount needed to run the

renovation. Professor of Che-
mistry J.N. Burnett, head of
the Chemistry department,
added, ‘‘Any grant that
we get in the future will allow

us to claim half as much in the
Dana Grant.”

New equipment has already
been ordered. Work will begin
during spring bread and is
scheduled to be completed by
September 1979.

According to Director of the
Physical Plant Grover C.
Meetze, Jr.. renovations will
include complete mechanical
overhaul and installation of
heating. air conditioning. and
new plumbing. New equip-
ment, such as fumed hoods
and lab supplies. will be added

and various spaces will be |

relocated. These renevations
will not only update the buil-
ding but make it a more
pleasant place in which to
work, Meetze commented.

Plans also include the addi-
tion of a stockroom to be
located outside the building
and for the construction of an
elevator. The plans were de-
signed with a possibility of
adding a new wing in the
future.

These plans are essentially
complete and Meetze believes
the renovation will go as
scheduled.

Even though the renovation
is needed. it could possibly
cause problems for chemistry
majors because the building
will not be used at all during

_ Martin budget reaches half

at a glance:

spring term of 1979; therefore
no lab classes can be taught.
Burnett has devised a sche-
dule in which these problems
are to be alleviated. During
the fall and winter term of
1979, the ceilings will be
doubled ‘toe accomodate all
students. Spaces will be avail-
able for freshmen and sopho-
mores.

Burnett does not believe
chemistry majors’ programs
will be affected.

Steve Porter, a junior chem.
istry major from Columbia.
‘S.C. who. could possibly be
affected by the Martin project,
agrees that the renovation is
much needed but that it is
affecting him. “It’s eausing
some inconvenience. For ex-
ample, | need a course which is
only offered spring term every
year. I'm being forced to take
it this spring term but I also
have to take another course
this spring that's really hard..
but I don't have any choice.”

The renovations will make
lower level lab work easier.
Also, with new equipment,
some upper level lab classes
can be completed which aren’t
possible to complete now.
Porter commented. He be- °
lieves the place is a hazard,
‘Renovations will make the
whole lab situation safer.”

College checks fire hazards:

By STEPHEN V. GOLD
Asst. News Editor

Four weeks ago, residents of
a four-story dormitory decora-
ted their halls elaborately with
Christmas trees, posters, and
crepe-papered streamers, pre-
paring for the upcoming holi-
days: The decorations presen-
ted a fire hazard.

This could well have been a
Davidson dormitory -- but this
particular one was Aquinas
Hall, at Providence Hall
(Rhode Island), scene of a
tragic fire that took seven
lives, injuring 15 others.

The disaster alarmed many
schools, including Davidson,
into forming a review board.

Just how well is Davidson
prepared for meeting an emer-
gancy? Is Davidson fire-safe?

According to Director of
Student Housing Scotty Nich-
olls and Director of the Physi-
cal Plant Grover C. Meetze,
Jr. the fire-protection at Da-
vidson, especially in the
dorms, is very good. That is,
until students clutter the
rooms and halls with hazard-
ous objects.

“The (dorm) stairwells are
fire-stairs,”. states. Nicholls.
“They have doors attached to
separate them from the corri-

In. addition, the buildings
‘are “as fire safe as possible...
constructed with concrete and
brick, and a minimum -of

Raman alee ie

. ‘Each hall-has a fire alarm,
which can wake up the occu-
pants of an entire building,

but cannot be immediately
turned off.

The alarm is not connected
to the fire department, how-
ever, it is the students’ re-
sponsibility to make the call to
the fire department.

One of Davidson's biggest
problems is students tamper-
ing with fire extinguishers.
Nicholls and Assistant to the
President Gary Barnes both
consider the situation at a
serious level.

“Some students like to
shoot (the extinguishers) off
with frequency,’’ comments
Barnes. ‘But there's a time
lapse in refilling the extingui-
shers.”’

“We have put up warn.
ings,’’ says Nicholls.

The warnings state that it is
a 500 dollar fine, and/or six
months in jail for giving false
alarms or setting off an extin-
guisher. The notices, however,
are usually removed.

Upwards of 30 extingui-
shers have been illegally dis-
charged this year.

The danger in the dorms
greatly increases, as Nicholls
and Meetze point out, when
candles, flammable wall hang-
ings, cigarettes, illegal open
coil hotplates, and similar
objects begin cluttering
rooms.

The halls that are blocked

_ with bikes, chairs, and plants

also contribute, worsening the
situation.

Off-campus houses are the
roast wufe of alt buildings.
They are old, wooden struc.
tures,.with smoke alarms in
them: Some have fire escapes,

some do not. The fire depart-
ment inspects them every
three months.

Davidson's reviewing pro-
gram would like to modernize
the fire-prevention /emergency
plans to include inspections of
dorms by fire officials.

A pre-fire plan of the inside
and outside of each building is
being developed for immediate
fire-fighting and evacuation
procedures in an emergency.

“Our main concern is peo-
ple,” Meetze emphasizes.
Now the fire department is in
complete control (in fighting
fires), and (the rescue squad)
helps by saving people.’

The school runs its own
trained rescue squad, which is
equipped with a rescue ladder
that can reach any dorm floor,
and oxygen masks for entering
a building. The future obtain-
ment of a ‘‘rescue trampoline’
for jumping victims is being
considered.

How can a disaster similar
to the Providence occurrence
by prevented?

First, the fire -- on the top
floor in the middle of the night
-- may have been started by
Christmas lights according to
Nicholls. Then, when the a-
larm was pulled, most. girls
felt it was false, and stayed in
bed.

. "The greatest danger is
from smoke inhalation, and
Poisonous vapors (from burn-
ing mattresses), Nicholls feels.

“Stay down as low as you
Can’get, close the room door”.
if you are trapped, “and don't
panic, don't jump. Wait for
help.”
