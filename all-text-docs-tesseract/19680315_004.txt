Three Stories

- As the 1967-68 basketball season draws to an end,
(Lefty hopes the end is four games away in L.A.), I
thought I should devote a column to those seniors who
won't be with us next year. Since we only have three
on the team, it is fairly easy to do. You can tell which

layers are the seniors by the satisfied smirk on their

ces. They're closing out their last basketball season
on a team that is in the NCAA tournament besides
being ranked eighth in the nation. It’s not a bad way
to go.

Naturally, Rodney Knowles should be the first
mentioned. Not only is he the best-known of the three,
but his name comes before the other two alphabetically.
Rodney in his three varsity years at Davidson accom-
plished something that very few players in the South-
ern Conference have done. He was picked second team
all-conference his sophomore year, first team last year,
and honorable mention this year. A clean sweep.

Speaking of honor, Rodney represented Davidson
basketball in a North Carolina advertising gimmik for
the Wall Street Journal. The advertisment had a picture
of Rodney, Eddie Biedenbach of NC State, Larry Miller
of UNC, Norwood Toddman of Wake Forest and Mike
Lewis of Duke in their respective basketball uniforms.
The ad was pointing out to big business that companies
in North Carolina have a low rate of lost work hours.
Rodney and his photogenic buddies were an additional
treason why North Carolina is a good state for business,
pointing out the good colleges in the state. But putting
aside advertisements and basketball, Rodney will be
missed next year by the team. He was a key man in our
bridge playing foursome on the road trips.

Like Rodney, Tom Youngdale has been around for
four years. As the “forgotten ‘'Cat” (a name derived
from a story in one of tne Charlotte papers this year)
Tom joined the skin team this year atter two years of
glory as a shirt. Tom received the supreme compli-
ment this year when Bucky Waters, the West Virginia
coach, said if he had Youngdale, he would have a
really good team. Tom always played well against WVU
and Coach Waters respects him.

At times it seems as though Tom is a photographer
at heart. He has had some fantastic displays around
campus. Some of the players on the team think Tom
has a strange sense of humor. His idea of something
funny, is putting a sign on the old horse-drawn fire
engine on display in a glass covered frame near Char-
lotte’s Freedom Park saying ‘BREAK GLASS IN CASE
OF FIRE.” He could make some money by sending the
picture to Life for the back page.

Speaking of strange things, Bob Pickens is our
third senior. Unlike Rodney and Tom, he has only been
in the business at Davidson for two years. He starred
at Brevard Jr. College two years previously. Being
from West Virginia, Bob gets kidded quite a bit about
his accent, eating habits, and clothes. When we were
in New York, I thought we would have to get him an
interpreter so that people could understand him. Bob
is the type that likes catsup on a five dollar steak. He
wears the latest plaids and checks. He is one of the
friendliest players on the team and it never ceases to
amaze him how, in the big cities, no one smiles or says
anything to each other on the streets.

Bob is the court leader of the skin team and if
anyone does, he knows what each of us will do in a
certain situation. At the present time Bob is planning
the skin strategy in case we should play St. Bonaven-
ture in the Regionals. Bob is sure their substitutes,
“the F troop,” couldn’t keep up with Davidson’s skin
team.

Tall, Tough Lions
"Cats First Test

By BOB DUNHAM
News Editor

Davidson's nationally rank-
ed Wildcats faced tall, tough
and talented Columbia Uni-
versity this evening as they
advanced into the Eastern
Regional Tournament of the
NCAA basketball play-offs in
Raleigh.

In one of their roughest en
counters of the season, the
eighth.ranked ‘Cats met the
Lions, seventh-ranked nation-
ally, in the first game of the
evening.

For the first time this
season, the Davidson five
was outsized. A major con-
tributing factor in this size
difference was the presence
of 7-footer Dave Newmark,
the Lion’s center.

.A pair of talented sopho
mores, 6-5 Jim McMilian and
6-4 Heyward Dotson. lead
scoring for the team, which
has amassed a 224 record
this season.

It was Dotson’s play which
helped the Lion's out-class
LaSalle 83-69 in the first
round of the NCAA tourna-
ment last weekend at College
Park, Md.

McMillian, however, has
been the’ Lions’ most consist-
ent scorer during the season,
averaging 22.8 points per
game. He has been partic-
ularly effective on corner
jumpers and driving. inside
shots

The other starters for the
Columbia five included 6-3
Roger Walaszek and 6-3 Bill
Ames.

One factor which falls in
Columbia’s favor is its tre-
mendous size in weight. The
starting five average 207
pounds, with Ames, a
guard, the smallest at 180.

“They are a big, strong
club,"" said Davidson coach
C. G. (Lefty) Driesell. “We
will have to be at our best.
We'll have to be up.”
‘Driesell planned to start
64 sophomore Mike Maloy on
Newmark, with juniors
Wayne Huckel and Dave Mo-
ser covering Dotson and
McMillian. He did admit
thoughts of starting a taller
team against the Lions, but
was uncertain about its ef-
fectiveness.

He planned to start a man-
to-man defense against the
Columbia five, with a prob-
able press to begin the game.
It has been Davidson's basic
defense all season, and Drie-
sell hoped it would force Co-
lumbia into some crucial
mistakes.

A factor which the coach-
ing staff has noticed in watch-
ing game films of the Colum-
bia-LaSalle contest was the
deliberate offense of the
Lions. which brings the ball
downcourt slowly.

Driesell hoped that this
was an indication that a press
would force them into play-
ing Davidson's running fame.
for which they might be un.
prepared.

‘Win or lose this evening.
Davidson will have its hands
full tomorrow night. Should
they win, the ‘Cats will ad-
vance te the finals against
the winner of the St. Bona-
venture-North Carolina game.
A loss would mean a conso-
lation game against the los-

Either way, the game will
be rough. St. Bonaventure
was ranked third in the As-
sociated Press’ final poll
this week, while the Tar
Heels were ranked fourth.
If they win tonight, the na.

tional championshpi is only
three wins away. A loss, on
the other hand, would mean
elimiation from _ further
competition.

Redmen Tumble;
Wildcats Live On

By DON SEWELL
Sports Editor

Davidson's late-game ‘surge
overcame a stubborn St.
John’s team 79-70, in last Sat-
urday'’s game at College
Park, Md. It was that vic-
tory that propelled the Wild-
cats into tonight's Eastern
Regional semi-finals in Ra-
leigh.

The ‘Cats led most of the
way in that game with the
Redmen, but the outcome
was not decided until the
final minutes. With about
five and a half misutes re-
maining in the game S$).
John’s pulled ahead by
one, 68-67.

Then Davidson's tough de-
fense rally began to pay off.
In those last five and a half
minutes of play the ‘Cats
made five steals, and turned
most of them into key points.

In the last three minutes of
the game Dave Moser made
three of the ‘Cats’ cricial
steals. Moser hit for only
three points in the game. but
his defense more than made
up for his poor point produc-
tion.

Mike O'Neill, off the bench
in the final minutes, hit two
important free throws to
stretch the slim Davidson
lead to five points with just
over a minute remaining.
From then on it was a mat-
ter of St. John’s having to
foul to get the ball, and the
Wildcats converting their foul
shots.

_ “I thought we played pret-
ty well against St. John's,”
Coach C. G. (Lefty) Driesell
said, ‘“‘but they played espe-
cially well.”

He added that they play-
ed much better than they
hed in their 16 point toss to
the ‘Cats In New York early
in January.

The Redmen outrebounded
Davidson 40-37. But their
edge on the boards was neu-
tralized by frequent turnov-
ers. St. John’s had 17 turn-
overs to eight by the Wild-
cats.

Driesell added that the Da-
vidson team could possibly
have been more spirited in
the St. John's game. He gave
his team credit for playing a
good game to defeat the Red-
men, but he pointed out that
the ‘Cats will have to play a
better game against Colum-
bia in order to advance in
the Eastern Regional tourna-
ment.

In addition to outrebound-
ing the Wildcats, the Redmen

Pointman Moser

Keys Cage Drive

A key to the Davidson of-
fensive assault in the post-
season tournaments has been
the play of junior point man,
Dave Moser.

Practically unbeatable at
getting the ball downcourt,
be has been quite valuable
against the various press de-
fenses used against the ‘Cats.

“He's hard to beat in a
one-on-one situation.’’ com-
mented Wildcat coach C. G.
(Lefty) Driesell. “He did a
great job for us during the
Southern Conference tourna-
ment and again against St.
John's last weekend.”

margin was provided at the
foul line where the ‘Cats con.

Diiesell commended Mike
Maloy, Doug Cook. Jerry
Kroll and Rod Knowles for
their point-production in last
week's game. Wayne Huckel,
as well as Moser, was cited
for strong defensive efforts.

The win was the thir-
teenth in a row for the
Wildcats, who have not
been beaten since Jan. 13,
in an overtime loss at the
hands of West Virginia.

Seekers
Troubled

The Wildcats will have a
large following this weekend
in Raleigh, but not without
some problems.

A thousand tickets were
made available to the col-
lege for the two night tour-
naments, but some students
were still in search of tick-
ets for the games this morn-
ing.

Dr. Tom Scott. Davidson
athletic director, said Wed-
nesday that “every student
who asked for a ticket re-
ceived one: after that the
tickets went to alumni and
friends of the college.”

Several students, however,
noted that their money for
the tickets had been returned
with a note stating that tick-
ets had been sold out and
that their reservations were
cancelled.

The tickets. which were
originally sold for four dol-
lars per session, were being
sold for much higher ‘prices
this week as tickets became
scarce. One offer to THE
DAVIDSONIAN this week of-
fered tickets to the highest
bidder, stating that'a $35 of-
fer had already been receiv-
ed.

Honors are beginning to
accumulate for the Wildcat
basketball squad as_ they
close out a highly successful
season.

The Southern Conference
season and tournament
champions have placed
several players on all-star
teams since the regular
season came to ea close two
weeks ago.

Sophomore Mike Maloy,
the talented hoopster from
Queens, N. Y., was the first
to receive recognition, when
he was named to the All-
Southern Conference team.
Along with West Virginia's
Ron Williams, he led the bal-
loting for the first team.

Fellow sophomore Doug
Cook and junior Wayne
Huckel were named to the
second team, while play-
maker Dave Moser and sen-
jor team captain Rodney
Knowles were named honor-

Maloy and Huckel also
placed in the balloting for the
Southern Conference Most
Valuable Player award.
While WVU's Williams paced
the field, Maloy placed sec-
ond in the vote and Huckel
tied for third place.

The latest awards announc-
‘ed which included ‘Cat play-
ers was the naming of the
Greensboro Daily News All-
State basketball team. The
two super-sophs, Maloy and
Cook, were both named to
the ten-man squad. Moser re-
ceived honorable mention.

The News team included
pleyers from the Carolinas
Conference, the Atlantic
Coast Conference, and the
Southern Conference. Da-
Idson, however, was the
only team from the South-
ern Conference represent-
ed on the squad.

and the AP wire service
polls.

North Carolina follows the
Bonnies in fourth place in
both sts. The Cotumbla
Lions, Davidson's foe in to-
night’s game, are ranked
sixth in the UPI poll and
seventh in the AP final
list.

Davidson is rated eighth in
the AP poll and ninth in the
UPI chart. This is the third
season that the Wildcats, un-
der Coach C. G. (Lefty) Drie-
sell, have finished the season

in the nation's top ten.

This season is the fifth of
the last six in which David-
son has won 20 or more ball
games. It will be the ‘Cats’
second trip to the Eastern
Regionals.

In the 1965-66 season, Dave
Bing and his Syracuse team-
mates and then St. Joseph's
handed the Wildcats two
straight defeats.

The national championship
lies four games ahead, but
the road will be a long one
for any team.
