Davidson Is Defeated
In Two Track Meets

—

Red and Black.

TRINITY MEET.

In her first inter-collegiate track mect
of the season Davidson last Friday met
defeat at the hands of Trinity, 81 to 36.
Trinity had an advantage over her rival
in that she had fresh men for all of the
events. For all the events Trinity en-
tered 23 men, while Davidson had only
10.

Brand smashed Johnson's record of
last year in the mile run, thereby win-
ning his “D." On the basis of points
won in the meet Perry, Morrison and
Grey also win a “D.”

Ruff, of ‘Vrinity, scored the highest
number of individual points, taking first
place in the too-yard dash, 220-yard
dash, and broad jump, for a total of 15
points out of possible 15. Other first
places won by Trinity men were low
hurdles, and high hurdles by Price, two
mile by Osborne, half-mile by Coman,
high jump and pole vaule by Matton,
and the shot put by ‘Thompson.

Crouch and Grev did the highest scor
ing for Davidson, the former winning
first place in the g4o-vard dash and. sec-
ond in half-mile, and the latter getting
first honors in the discus throw and sec
ond place in the shot put. Brand won
the only other first place for Davidson
by coming out ahead in the mile run.

A. & M. MEET.

The track team was defeated by the
fast crew of A. & M. College on the
latter’s field in Raleigh on last Monday
morning. The Tech lads won 80 points
to their opponents’ 36. “The meet was
not characterized by any record-breaking
speed, as the cinder path was not in
good shape. ‘The farmers took the lead
and held a wide margin thruout. Me
Dougald, of A. & M., was the individ
ual star, taking five first places, Perry
did good work for the Presbyterians.
winning first in the pole vault, second in
broad jump and two third places. Brand
did well on the long distances, but was
outclassed by the Tech boys.

HIGH SCHOOL

days. One of these is a declamation and

ed to the winners of this contest on the
closing night. The other event is an
entertainment to be given by the fifth
and sixth grades of the Grammar School.
This will probably take place a week or

Four Games Are Won
By Red and Black

Varsity Begins Trip In Successful
Manner.

CHARLOTTE GAME.

In a game characterized by hard hit-
ting and ragged fielding, Davidson lost
to Charlotte Wednesday by a score of
9g to 8 ‘Vhe-zame was a tie until the
ninth inning, when two singles and a
neat sacrifice enabled the leaguers to
push, across the winning run. Currie,
in the box for Davidson, was hit hard,
thirteen hits being garnered off his de-
livery. However, he pitched good ball
in the pinches. Redding, the first Char-
lotte twirler, was very effective for four
innings, but the locals found him for
eight hits and as many rons in the next
three, driving him from the mound.
Geary, who succeeded him, held David-
son in check for the remainder of the
wane.

Johnson and McMillan led the hit-
ting for the Red and Black, while
Myers had the best day at bat for Char-
lotte.

Score by innings: RL OH. OE.
Davidson 000 022 4oU-—-8 10° 3
Charlotte. 330 O10 101—9 13° 7

WOFFORD GAME,

Davidson easily defeated Wofford at
Spartanburg ‘Thursday to the tune of
9 to 3 in a rather slow game. Kirk-
wood, the Wofford ewirler, was hit hard
and was unsteady in the pinches. Henge:
veld pitched for the Red and Black, and
tho he was hit hard, managed to keep
the hits well scattered. He was ac-
corded excellent support. by his team-
nutes. ‘

Davidson scored three runs in the first
inning. Johnson led off with a single
and was advanced to third by Alford
with another. McMillan -walked, fill-
ing the bases, and Kirkwood hit Saund-
ers, forcing in Johnson. Brown then
came across with a timely single, scoring
Alford and McMillan. Another run
came in the fourth on Wood's single and
two errors by the Wofford team. Kirk-
wood's wildness, an error by Morgan,
and a single by Black accounted for
three more runs in the fifth, while sin-
gles by Johnson and McMillan and a
double by Brown in the ninth inning
gave the team its final pair of tallies.
Johnson led the hitting for the locals,
getting three hits out of four times up.
Wood's fielding was a feature. He ac-
cepted seven chances without an error.
Moore was the star for Wofford, get-
ting three hits.

Score by innings: R. H. BE.
Davidson 300 013 002—9 9 2
Wofford 000 10t coOI—3 8 3

The next two games of the trip were
plaved with Furman University, at
Greenville, on Friday and Saturday.
Both games resulted in a victory for the
Red and Black, the scores being 4 to 2
and 14 to Tt.

Lawson was Coach Fetzer’s choice on
the mound for the first game, and he
pitched great ball, striking out eight men
and allowing but seven scattered hits.
He was given strong support by his
team-mates. Both of Furman’s runs
came in the first inning. Davidson came
