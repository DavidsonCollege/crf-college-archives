Suggesting of Increased Council

Representation Will Also Be
Discussed

The Davidson College Alumni Asso-
ciation will hold one of its most im-
portant meetings of the year next Mon-
day night in Charlotte. The meeting

Mr. James C. Harper, '15, of Lenoir,
principal of the schools in Lenoir, will
show moving pictures of the Davidson
campus which he made the
Christmas holidays, some moving. pic-
tures of the Carolina-Davidson foot-
hall game here last Home-Coming Day,
and some pictures of other campuses
throughout North Carolina. This
being done with the object of deter-
mining whether it would be wise for
the Council to invest in moving picture
for use in its local alumni
meetings, or whether they will recom-
mend that the college purchase such
equipment.

Another important matter for con-
sideration the enlargement. of the
Alumni Council This body now con-
sists of seven members, elected by the
General Alumni at its
meeting each commencement. It has
been proposed, however, that Davidson
have a Council on which every class
would be represented, and each local
alumni chapter be represented by its
three officers, with a smaller group
acting as an executive committee, do-
ing the work now accomplished by the
Council of seven. This matter will be
thoroughly discussed, and a possible de-
cision reached.

Association

Some time will probably be devoted
to a preliminary discussion of nomina-
tions for the board of trustees from
the alumni body, and consideration of
officers for the ensuing year. No defi-
nite action is expected upon these until
a later meeting, however. A mail bal-
lot will be sent out to the alumni early
in April containing the nominations
This was a new idea instituted Jast
year, and much favorable comment
Was passed on the plan.

The alumni will present
statistics from institutions in
North Carolina and Virginia, showing
that each college or university is going
to promulgate alumni activity in a
financial way. The advisability of ap-
pointing a committee to appear before
the executive committee of the board
of trustees, to ask for a larger appro-
priation to the alumni office will be
discussed ,and possible action taken.

Members of the Alumni Council are

Centralization Urged

Ohio Wesleyan University—(CNA)—
Plan the schedule for your college course
so that it will enable you to secure a mas-
tery of. subject matter to a considerable
degree in at least three subjects. Such
is the advise which Prof. A. R. Mead
of the department of education offers to
Ohio Wesleyan students who are plan-
ning to do high school teaching after
their graduation.

Approximately 80 per cent. of the be-
ginning high school teachers throughout
the United States teach not less than
three subjects, Dr. Mead points out. In
selecting the three subjects for special
study, prospective high school teachers
should be careful to select subjects which
are taught in the secondary schools and

_ which are related in nature of subject

A surprise marriage of January was
that of Mr. Frank P. Morton, '23, and
Miss Margaret True, both of Greens-

the immediate relatives.

Greensboro and has spent practically
all of his life in that city. He is now
manager of the O. Henry Hotel in
Greensboro. They will reside at the

CAPT. PRITCHETT TALKS

Coaches Monk Younger and Tex
Tilson and Ernest Milton Also
Attended and Made Brief
Remarks

Twenty Davidson College alumni, re-
siding in Concord and towns nearby,
met in the office of Mr. W. W. Flowe,
‘os, in the Cabarrus Savings Bank
Building, at Concord, last Monday
night at 7:30 o’clock, the meeting hav-
ing been called for the principal pur-
pose of listening to an address by Capt.
Norton G. Pritchett, director of physi-
cal education at Davidson.

This was the third alumni body be-
fore which Capt. Pritchett has appear-
ed to outline his proposal for physical
education at Davidson, and in his usual
attractive manner he poined at the ad-
vantages which would accrue from a
systematized program, which would
include credit, just as the present sub-
jects are credited to students. He
pointed out the urgent need of a build-
ing, maintaining that no effective work
could be done until proper facilities
were available.

Discussion of hte proposal followed.
Among the commenters were Dr. J.
C. Rowan, '04, and Coach Younger, of
Davidson. The former asked some di-
rect, pertinent questions regarding the
proposal, and the latter gave his sanc-
tion to the idea, telling the alumni that
it would serve as a possible means of
developing good athletes. Coach Tex
Tilson and Ernest Milton also made a
few brief remarks.

W. W. Morris, ‘92, president, pre-
sided at the meeting. Others attending
were P. B. Fetzer, '04; Rev. J. C. Row-
an, D.D. 'o4; W. W. Flowe, ’05; Rev.
