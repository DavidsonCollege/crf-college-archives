Five
Sick After
FIJI Bash

Five Davidson students had one too
many shots of tequila at the “Hit Me
with Your Best Shot” party at the Fiji
House on Friday night, 1 October and
wound up in the infirmary.

__ A friend of one fraternity member
that went to the infirmary said, “We
were worried about him; his breathing
seemed shallow.”

The party consisted of shots of te-
quila, bourbon, and Schnapps, ordered
by one student and sent to another via
sparsely clad waitresses who would not
disclose the sender’s identity.

Even though some people couldn’t
hold their liquor, most poeople had a
good time. Says one freshman: “it was
the best party I’ve ever been to.”

Colleges
Increase

Suspensions

CPS—Colleges anda universities are
getting much tougher on misbehaving
students, according to a study just re-
leased by the University of Maryland.

The study shows that administrators
are suspending 40 percent more stu-
dents per year than they used to, are
tightening disciplinary procedures, and
making it easier to bring students before

Based on a random survey of some
150 colleges, the study says 7.8 stu-
dents per campus were suspended dur-
ing the 1980-81 school year, compared
to 5.5 students in 1979-80.

There was also “a clear trend to in-
crease the severity of sanctions” against
students, says Dr. Scott Rickard, vice
chancellor of student affairs at the Uni-
versity of Maryland-Baltimore and di-
rector of the survey.

“Our research,” he adds, “indicates
that administrators think there are too
many procedural rules” protectiangaaa
students against disciplinary sanctions.

“During the decade of the seventies,
student due-process provisions were
implemented extensively.” Students

Affairs officers told Rickard’s re-
searchers taht the rules had become
“overly legalistic, cumbersonme and
too technical.”

As aresult, “many campuses are ex-
amining this so it is quicker, simpler and
more accountable,” Rickard summar-
izes. “They clearly want to maintain the
necessary due-process rules to protect
student rights, but many campuses feel
it’s gone beyond what’s necessary.”

The increase in the number of sus-
pensions may, in addition to the effects
of easier disciplinary procedures, be
due to more violence on campus. The
survey found the number of physical as-
sault cases among students increased by
75 percent between 1979-80 and 1980-
81.

WDAV’s Clark
to Tour German
Broadcasting
Centers

CREE

WDAYV station manager John Clark
is participating in a study tour of the
principal broadcasting centers in West
Germany, sponsored by the Goethe In-
stitute, the cultural arm of the Federal
Republic of Germany.

Clark is one of 12 American special-
ists in the field of public radio invited to
take part in the tour. The group’s itener-
ary includes stops in Berlin, Munich,
and Cologne.

In addition to visiting and learning

‘about West Germany’s radio broadcast-

ing system, Clark will study arts feature
production techniques and view the re-
hearsal recording of a Berlin Philhar-
monic concert.

“I am especially pleased to have the
chance to see their approach to radio re-
cording and production, because
WDAV is actively involved in record-
ing local and regional concerts and pro-
ducing programming to promote the arts
locally ,” Clark said.

Clark joined WDAV in March,

1981, after serving as director of pro- .

motion and development for KPBS ra-
dio in San Diego. He previously served
as director of field services for FOUNT
(Friends of University Network Televi-
sion) in Chapel Hill, and as an an-
nouncer and programmer at WUNC ra-
dio in Chapel Hill.

He also has worked with commer-
cial radio stations in Chapel Hill, Ra-
leigh and Elizabethtown, N.C. ~

College
Computer
Adds Memory

The Davidson College Computer
Services Center added 0.5 megabytes
(500,000 units of memory) to each of its
Prime computers this summer. The
Prime 750 now has two megabytes, and
the Information system has 1.5 meg-
abytes of memory. .

The new memory is called ECC me-
mory (Error Correction Code), and the
computer uses it to handle instrucitons
that people transmit through terminals.
ECC memory contrasts with disk me-
mory, which stores files (programs,
text, data) for prolonged periods. The
addition of ECC memory will help the
computers manage more operations
than they have in the past.

On an expansion drive, those
members sent out flyers announcing an
EMT course to be taught on campus by
the Central Piedmont Community Col-
lege. Fifteen to twenty students com-
pleted the course, which met for three
hours a night, two nights a week
throughout winter term, and ended with
the EMT exam.

Hopkins states that the service
hopes to be able to sponsor the EMT
course again this winter, open to all stu-
dents, whether interested in joining the
service or not. He also emphasizes the
fact that the ERS is competent and will-
ing to help. In his words, ““We’re here to
serve the campus in whatever way we

”

can.

ENT to Certify
Emergency
Medical
Technicians

Junior Bob Hopkins, a member of
the all-volunteer Davidson Emergency
Rescue Service, decribes his group’s
work as ranging “from CPR to child-
birth.”

Started in 1978, the ERS is com-
posed of eighteen students trained and
certified as Emergency Medical Techni-
cians.

Their system functions as follows:
both a registered nurse at the College In-
firmary and one pair of EMTs are on du-
ty at all times. The nurse mans the emer-
gency telephone number (892-3031)
and relays any message to the EMTs on
duty, by means of a radio communica-
tions system.

Receiving the information on their
beepers, the two rush directly to the
scene in an automobile which contains
the necessary equipment usually carried
on an ambulance.

This year the ERS is headed by chief
Lisa Young; its current memoersnip of
eighteen students grew from four during
winter term last year.

College President Dr. Samuel
Spencer attended the 30th anniversay
celebration of the Fulbright Scholarship
program in Germany at the Rheinisch
Friedrich Wilhelm University in Bonn
on Monday, 4 October.

Spencer was one of six program par-
ticipants at an academic convocation in
the morning, followed by a reception
and luncheon hosted by the German
Foreign office.

In connection with the event,
Spencer also attended a reception for
Senator Fulbright, hosted by U. S. Am-
bassador Arthur F. Burns, and a dinner
for American Fulbright professors in

Senator J. William Fulbright, for
whom the scholarship program is

‘ named, also took part in the event. Ful-

bright served as U.S. Senator from Ar-
kansas during the years 1945-74 achiev-
ing a reputation as the most influential
legislator ever in the field of foreign re-
lations.

Spencer currently serves as chair-
man of the Board of Foreign Scholar-
ships, the agency that oversees the Ful-
bright program and other U. S. interna-
tional exchange programs. He has been
a strong supporter of international stu-
dies and international exchange pro-
grams.

Spencer took time during his trip to
visit some 17 Davidson students who
are studying this year at the Phillips-
University in Marburg, West Germany.
