“Conference champs this year!?!?” Thus spoke ten-
nis mentor Dick McKee in a half quizzical — half em-
phatic manner as he pondered the Wildcat tennis for-
tunes for the coming season.

“We'll know where we stand early this year. We

- play George Washington, the defending champions on

the 17th of this month, so the big test is right around the
corner.

“The material is here — best I’ve had since the
conference winners of 55. The top seven will probably
be Semi Mintz, John Poindexter, Tom McCutchen, Dick
Hodel, Doug Orr, Finley Lee and Harry Broome. Then
‘ there’s Rick Aderholt and — and — uh (I coughed slight-
ly as a subtle hint) oh yes —:— Aderholt and Hamilton
on the Goon squad” (I was sorry I'd coughed).

“Our main problem,” McKee continued, “is get-
ting in shape before the George Washington match.
We just got on the courts this week and there are on-
ly about nine days between now and the 17th that
‘Vl be able to work with the team.”

The coach is again faced with the perennial bug-a-
boo of Davidson tennis — unprepared tennis courts. As
late in the week as Thursday only three courts were suit-
» able for play.

“There’s also the problem of getting these boys
who've been playing other sports conditioned for ten-
_ nis,” joked the coach. “Semi Mintz has been putting the
ball in the net ali basketball season — now he’ll have to
relearn to knock the ball over the net. And John Poin-
dexter has been out on the wrestling mat. You can
imagine what that does for your tennis; he'll be so tight
he won't be able to get the racket back.

“Our doubles ought to be strong this year. I plan

to use either Orr and Lee or Mintz and Poindexter at|are definitely faced with the| phan Young will give the ‘Cats! "¢ly too much on three boys for} ©”

The Davidson College basketball team wrapped up jhaving one match which ended

ginia by a score of 100-65.

The Wildcats ended the
season with a 9-15 record.

When questioned on the team
record, Coach Scott was quick
to reply, “This squad is the

years, even though the rec-

The success or failure of the squad this year may
well rest on the doubles combinations. With teams
tike North Carolina, George Washington, Duke, M.1.T.
and Ohio State on the schedule, more than one out-
come will be decided in the last three doubles matches.

season were seniors Semi Mintz

averaged 13.6 and 186 respec-
tively for the regular season.

Sophomore Bill Shinn aver-
aged 12.7 and will be back
to lead the Wildcats next sea
son.

Coach Scott's speculation on
next season is: “Even though
we lose 6 good boys we will
have equally as good a team!
next year because of the fine
Freshinen who will be moving
up and the returning lettermen.
We still need that big strong |
boy though.”

Accompanying Coach Parker
were Ubi de Frietas, Milton
Gee, “Westy” Westervelt, Cliff
Thompson, and Alex Porter.

Exchange student de Frictas,
who wrestles in the 123 Ib.
class, lacks the benefit of the
experience some of his team-
mates have, but is a strong com-
petitor and may do quite well.

_ individual honors is Milton Gee. '

son took over and closed out
the season with a win in the’
final match with Washington’

ALEX PORTER

Alex Porter, who finished a'
very successful season wrest-
ling in the heavyweight di-
vision, is classified along with
Gee and Westervelt as one of
the top individual title seek-
ers. Coach Parker says that |

Porter has an excellent chance
to make the finals.

Asked about team prospects,
Coach Parker said that V.P.I.
would be the team to beat and
will probably take the team
title for the second year in a
row. He went on to say that
West Virginia will also be very
strong and should finish in the
runner-up position with. David-
son possibly third.
