Honors Center Snarls

Rocky River Project

By TOM BRUCE
Senior News Editor

Both faculty and students at
the newly created Center for
Honors Studies admit that the
pilot year for the Center's
“Rocky River Project” has
been poorly organized and
disappointing '

“If the project doesn’t im-
prove a great deal next year, I
shall be very disappointed,”’
stated the Dean of the Honors
Center Earl R. MacCormac in
an interview this week.

““We have had to spend a lot
of time raising money to fund
the program and a8 a result,
we have not been able to em-
phasize the educational as-
pects of the program. It has
not been rigorous, not nearly
enough,’’ MacCormac stated.

This particular complaint
was echoed time and again by
students in the Center. One
student, who asked to be
anonymous said: ‘‘I have not
seen much sign of enthusiasm
from the faculty for the
project. They do not object to
hearing a report on water
pollution read to them over
lunch, but very few of them
want to go out to the river it-
self.”

Significantly, very few
Honors Center students stated
that they were indifferent to
the project. But they
repeatedly said that one of the
chief problems with the
program was that indifferent
students were forced to par-
ticipate.

‘Many students who are not
members of the Honors Center
would probably be more en-
thusiastic about the project
than some of the present par-
ticipants,” stated senior Tom
Hai

tley.

“I don’t believe that mem-
bership in the Honors Center
should be linked with a project
that may hold little interest
for some students.”

From the beginning the
Rocky River Project was
planned to cut across both the
natural and the social scien-

biological, chemical,
economic, and political fac-
tors which account for the
polluted condition of the
Rocky River. The river flows
under Highway 73 less than 15
miles from the campus.

“We are neither as far
along as I had hoped, nor as
far behind as I had feared we
might be at this time,” stated
Professor of Biology David
Grant.

“We have taken the first
steps toward instructing
students who are not science-
specialists in the scientific
method. Next year we can
begin to explore the political
and economic ramifications of

The pilot stage of the project
will be completed this sum-
mer when the Center hires
five student interns. Three of
the students will work in
biology and two in chemistry.

Their major job will be to
compile data relating to water
samples that have been collec-
ted along the river. They will
earn $800 stipends.

Grant expressed hope that
the next phase of the project
would be better organized and
more highly integrated. ‘‘Our
activity this year has been
erratic with students at a low
profile throughout the year.
We have not had any con-
centrated study within a
single academic term.

The pilot year has included
two sessions with Dr. Ruth
Patrick, a noted specialist in
studies similar to Rocky
River. Patrick came to the
campus twice during the year,
once in the winter and once in
the spring.

“Dr. Patrick was a brilliant
lecturer," said senior Jeff

of enthusiasm in _ those
sessions.”’

was disappointed on her
second trip that more has not
been accomplished. Some of
the data that she specifically
requested has not been collec-
ted,’’ Manley said.
Participants in the project
are being given one academic
credit, which most of the
students have elected to be
evaluated ‘‘pass-fail.”’

“Because the organization
this year has been so erratic, I
don’t think some of the stu-
dents are making a very
strong effort,’ reported John-
ston reported.

“Very few observed the
deadline for the one short
paper we were required to
write, and I understand that
many have still not turned one
in, ten weeks after the dead-
line,’’ Johnston said

A number of veteran mem-
bers of the Honors Center
commented that the Project
had introduced a new spirit of
cooperation and comraderie
into the Center.

‘“‘We are doing work
together and meeting with
poeple in many different
fields,’ said senior Woody
Connette. “I think that in
years. past most people just
went their own way in isola-
tion from the Center as a body.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE
SELF-SCHEDULED EXAMINATIONS
SPRING TERM 1973-74

The colleg

e calendar calls for exams to be taken May

13, 14, 15, 16. Not all professors use the self-scheduled

described here, so each student should deter-
mine definitely the exam arrangements for each course.
If self-scheduled procedures are used then the following

instructions apply.

Go to the Student Store in Belk Hall and purchase an
exam envelope for each of your courses using self-
scheduled exams. Fill in the appropriate identification
information on both the yellow and red cards and also on
the top section of the envelope. Give the envelope with
both cards still attached to your professor by Tuesday,

May 7.

The examination envelopes turned in will be available
to you during each examination session on May 13, 14, 15,
16. You do not need to specify in advance when you will

write a particular exam.

Go to Chambers Banquet Hall between 8:40 and 9:15
for morning sessions and 1:40 and 2:15 for afternoon
sessions and asks for the envelope containing the exam
you want to take at that time. The envelopes will be
arranged alphabetically vy the student’s name. The
yellow card will be detached and retained by the exam-

ination staff.

Go to any classroom in Chambers Building and write
the exam; please note that room 310 in Chambers is to be
used exclusively by students authorized by the professor

to use tables, charts, etc.

The envelope with red card still attached and con-
taining the questions and your answers may be returned
to the examination center as early as 9:45 for the mor-
ning and 2:45 for the afternoon and must be returned
before the deadline of 12:15 for the morning and 5:15 for
the afternoon. The honor pledge must be signed at the
examination center table as you turn in the exam en-

velope.

The yellow card, now receipted by the examination
center, will be given you; hold that card until a grade for
the course is received; in case of any irregularity it is
your evidence that you turned in the exam envelope con-

taining exam materials.

Each professor has been urged to take time in each
course to present his views on the honor system, and to

solicit continuing student support for it.
