Photography and Life on the Road to Mexico

Photojournalist Maeve Hickey presents unages of life on the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexico border

By BIty Roperts
Staff Writer

Last Tuesday Maeve Hickey
came to Davidson to talk about the
culture and the people that sur-
round the area of the border be-
tween the United States and
Mexico.

Dr, Nancy Fairley introduced
Hickey as an impressive multi-
media artist with a B.F.A. from
Rhode Island University. Hickey
also lays claim to international
exposure with collections on dis-
play in France, Ireland, the United
States, and Mexico.

The land around the U.S.-
Mexico border has interested this
Ireland native from her early years
when her father would listen to his
Mariachi music. Despite parental
admonitions to the contrary,
Hickey enrolled in the University
of Arizona as an undergraduate
because ofits proximity to Mexico.

Hickey haltingly described her
first experience south of the border
as a trip that affected her deeply.
This deep affectation had its roots
in the hospitality and happy cul-
ture she encountered just on the
other side of the chain link fence.

This first visit which took
place over fifteen years ago, she
painfully contrasted with her re-
cent visits made for the purpose to
photograph this culture.

Hickey is currently co-
authoring a book with Lawrence
Taylor called Life On the Road to
Mexico. Being a multi-media art-
ist who concentrates on photogra-
phy, Hickey will bring to this work
in progress all of the pictorial rep-
resentations of the Border area.

For Hickey, the Old Nogalas
Highway, which runs between
Tucson (60 miles north of the bor-
der) and Magdalena de Quino,
Mexico (60 miles south of the bor-
der), is the focus of the border
culture that she strives to capture
on film in Life On the Road to
Mexico. ;

“A place of contradictions,” is
how Maeve Hickey terms the bor-
der lands she studies, “It is at one
time barren and beautiful; peace-
ful and dangerous.”

Figures like Donny Caswell
and his Indentured Vaqueros,

_Josecito-The Littlest Pilgrim,

Tasha Leon-The Happiest Charac-
ter (a third generation bird cage
maker) and the omnipresent Power
Ranger Pinatas filled the slide show
Hickey presented in the second
half of her talk. Hickey took hun-
dreds of photos and realized only
upon their development how per-
vasive children were in her pho-
tography.
Equally as pervasive as the
children is the poverty. Hickey
laments, “By accident of birth, they

Sargent again as

students to move cars

By MATTHEW EIRICH '
News Editor

Game Management Director
Lee Sargent addressed the SGA
Tuesday night, seeking their help
and advice with the parking prob-
lems which accompany certain
basketball games and to inform the
group about changes in student
seating for basketball games.

Sargent said he anticipates
parking problems at six “key
games” during the basketball sea-
son, two each in December, Janu-
ary, and February.

Sargent said he wanted let stu-
dents know well in advance that he)
needs them to move their cars on
those days to Satellite parking be-
hind the sophomore dorms.

Several senators expressed
worry that Satellite was a danger-
ous place to be at night and that it
is not fair to ask students to endan-
ger themselves. Sargent said that
if necessary, the Athletic depart-

ment would hire a police officer to
stay in Satellite during game nights.

On any given night, Sargent
claims that 85 to 125 student and
staff cars are in the parking lot.
Some senators disputed this claim,
saying the number was much
smaller.

Sargent said he asks the Baker
staff to move their cars.Students
will nolonger occupy the same red
seats on one side of the arena.

Instead, students will be in the
red seats behind the opposing

. team’s bench and the bleacher sec-

tion directly behind those. Sargent
gave two reasons for the change.
He said that having students
directly behind the public address
system microphone produced some
embarrassing incidents last year.
But he also said the Athletic
department wanted to create more
of a home court advantage by con-
centrating student noise and en-
thusiasm in one section directly
behind the visitor’s bench.

Sargent said students in fact
have four more red seats than be-
fore. a
Groups of twenty-four stu-
dents will also alternate sitting be-
hind the opponent’ s basket, to make
noise and be a distraction.

Alec McCallister, who is in
charge of promotions for Davidson
athletics, accompanied Sargent to
discuss forming a Student Advi-
sory Committee for promotional
items. :

McCallister said a group of
five local restaurants have formed
“We Fuel the Wildcat’ s Fire” which
will give out $1500 in cash over
the course of the season.

Spirit parties may be held at
fraternity and eating houses after
games which only students who
went to the game will be able to
attend.

- Students will have the oppor-
tunity to compete for a 1995 Mus-
tang ateight home games by trying
to make half-court shots.

appreciate the efforts of the
Controller’s Office to work with
the Patterson Court officers, but

states, “They’re willing to work
with us now which is good, but my
opinion is that this could have been
avoided if they had kept everyone
involved from the start.”

Bagley states that the
Controller’s office is going to try
to communicate effectively to the
house officers “so that no one gets

taken by surprise.”

One change that may be made
is putting every agreement and es-
timate of charges in writing to avoid
future confusion. _

Bagley is hopeful that the
houses that owe the College can
pay off their debts over the next
two years.

ible, but they [the children] don’t
have safe drinking water.”

Most indicative of the squalid
conditions on the border are the
“Tunnel Rats”. Over 100 kids live
in a drainage ditch that extends
across the border. These kids are
exposed to rats, bats, disease, and
highly unsanitary living conditions
with no adult supervision.

“Mi Nuevo Casa” is a pro-
gram that attempts to ameliorate
the Tunnel Ratdilemma. MiNuevo
Casa is a day care center that pro-
vides food and daily shelter for the
children, but only if they promise
not to go back into the tunnel.

The only problem is that Mi
Nuevo Casa is only open during
the day. The children are left to
their own devices for lodging dur-
ing the night.

Hickey Says that even though
the United States government likes
to refer to the post-N.A.F.T.A.
border as invisible, but she says it
is hard to ignore the 2000 miles of
barbed wire and recycled chain
link fence and motion detectors.

Although Hickey loves and
respects Mexico and the border
area of the U.S., and even gave
birth to her daughter in rural Sinora,
a Mexican state, she “will always
be an anglo, a foreigner.”

And although she has deep
perceptions and feelings and good
photography of life in and around |

Mexico, she will never fully un-
derstand it, she says.
