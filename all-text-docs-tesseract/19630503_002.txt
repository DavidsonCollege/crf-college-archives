Toward A Beiter Understanding...

One of the most remarkable and
conz-oversial chapters in Davidson
College’s historv came to a close this
week when Dean of Faculty F. W.
Johnston accepted the resignation of
English professor W. F. Goodykoontz.

Everyone present at the discus-
sion Dr. Goodykoontz led during
chapel this morning realized that they
were being addressed by a man with
brilliant thoughts who can present his
ideas with knifelike clarity. This news-
paper supports at least in principle
nearly every constructive idea that
Dr. Goodykoontz brought out in the
discussion, and we feel that many
faculty members and most students.
particularly the 400 or more who were
present. at the Union. this morning.
support them also.

If the entire campaign had been
conducted in the manner of the dis-

cussion this morning, a great amount.

of positive good could have come out
ef the controversy. Other professors
and students in sympathy with the
cause of creativity would have rallied
to support Dr. Goodykoontz's objec-
tives. probably accomplishing several
ef them. But the plain and simple fact
is that the campaign degenerated: into
a vicious personal attack which was
carried on. not in rational discussions.
but in displavs on walls and in blister-
ing verbal broadsides.

Dean Johnston felt that the mat-
ter had reached an intolerable state
which left him no choice but to accept
Dr. Goodykoontz's resignation. and in
light. of manv things this editor saw
and heard happen this past week. this
“ditor is. forced by conscience to up-
hold that decision as just.

The ‘effective . immediately”
ahrase in the resignation’s acceptance
bv the Dean,-has stirred up an under-
standably bitter reaction among manv
“udents. That decision represented

For Creativity ...

An attempt must now be made
to explain and emphasize just what
the earliest and most important is-
sues of the controversy were. Dr.
Goodykoontz hit at the abstract core
of one of Davidson’s saddest prob-
lems—an. atmosphere that by its very
nature stifles creative effort.

Try this.for size: the chairman of
the Davidson Board of Trustees. J. Me-
Dowell Richards, was asked in a
forum. “In what way is a faculty mem-
ber free?” Richards answered. “He
does not have the freedom to teach
what he wants. However. he does have
the freedom to think as he wishes and
the freedom to leave." (THE DAVID-
SONIAN, February 19. 1960)

Or this. President D. Grier Mar-
tin, when asked about students parti-
cipating in picketing demonstrations,
“So long as students do not do any-
thing iNegal or violent, Davidson
would as far as I know institute no
action against them.” (THE ‘DAVID-
SONIAN, April 26, 1963)

Ever heard of academic freedom
or civil disobedience? But there is
more. Try taking an administration
with no outstanding liberal voice, a
largely uninterested student body
with few outspoken liberals and a
faculty with even fewer. Add al! that
together, apply perpetual pressure
from all directions in deference to the
trustees, and voila. Davidson College.

Here are a few of the more ob-
vious problems involved in the matter
of freedom of expression. There is
little creative writing at Davidson, no
sustained creative writing program,
and no outlet in.the wav of a printed
booklet for that what is written. Vale-
dictory and salutatory speeches were
abolished in 1960 following two con-
troversial speeches. Several faculty
members were told not long ago by
Dean of Facultv not.to write a letter
to the Charlotte newspaper. Senior
Class Day was abolished in 1961 fol-
lowing more critical speeches. Stud-
ents have been instructed as to certain
aspects of Davidson College which are
not to be criticized. The IFC itself
this year abolished skit night. which at
least represented an outlet for fresh-
man creativity and which could have
been revised in more appropriate form
rather than merely eradicated. The
organizer of a coming Great Issues
program has been told he can invite
any speaker to the campus he wishes.
Communists and Nazis excepted.

But to return to the idea of a
pervading atmosphere, it seems that
what the adult members of the David-
son family do not discourage in the
way of student creativity and self-ex-
pression, the student. body itself does.
There are hundreds of umbrellas on
this campus, and every one is jet

the most unpleasant part of a tragic
dilemma. The Dean took into account
aspects of the problem which perhaps
no other one person here is aware of,
including the consequences of losing
a professor of Dr. Goodykoontz’s vast
capabilities. Any statement to the con-
trary, particularly to the effect that
the welfare of the students invoived
‘was not even considered” by the
Dean in his decision. is completely
superficial.

Dr. Goodykoontz is a tremendous-
ly dedicated professor whose positive
influence on English students at Da-
vidson has been immeasurable. He
built a dynamic drama group out of
practically nothing in three — short
years. By sheer personality he has in-
spired many students to personal
heights in English literature and crea-
tive writing. and Davidson College
will never find anyone to adequately
replace him in those fields.

In the classroom, Dr. Goody-
koontz has been the type of professor
this college needs fifty :more of-—a
dedicated. inspiring educator with an
amazing knowledge of his field. He
has a concept -of education that too
few people at Davidson understand—
that mere facts presented in a straight
lecture hardly tend to encourage per-
Sonal pursuit of knowledge and un-
derstanding outside the classroom.
His departure will leave a_ hole
in the ranks of what liberals there are
among the facultv, as he has been the
focal point and guiding light of the
liberal element on campus.

That is the tragedy of the whole-af:
fair. Davidson is losing one of its fin-
est professors because what began as
a legitimate attempt to express dis-
satisfaction with the administration's
attitude toward creativity here was al-
lowed to turn into a personal attack

‘which eventually exceeded anv ac:

ceptable ethical bounds.

black. Students apparently feel they
must abide by certain rules of con-
duct: if you don't understand some.
thing. laugh at it. If you don’t agree
with something. deride it. Never un-
der any circumstances let anyone do
anything unusual without making a
clever and sophisticated remark about
it. Remarks like that hurt, and have a
decidedly negative effect on anyone
attempting to express himself in an
unconventional manner.

All the above presents an ex-
tremely dark picture, but sometimes
a light will flicker, if only brieflv. For
instance, a student writes a good play
and gets a chance to present it to an
audience. The Vagabonds’ Hootenan-
ny attracted wide student participa-
tion and plaved to a full house. Some-
times a student gets mad and lashes
out in a letter or simply in a bull ses-
sion trying to explain a new insight he
has had into something. Once in a
great while, a fraternity gets together
and decides to put on a play for a
drama contest. Occasionally someone
decides they don’t like segregation.
and does something about it—maybe
even goes picketing. And once upon a
May Day, a group of students got to-
gether and held a unique celebration.

Each of these few examples rep-
resents an instance of self-expression
and creativity. In many of these and
similar instances, spontaneity is in:
volved, and that is perhaps the most
vital element of creativity. But such
instances are almost hopelessly
sporadic.

In a more permissive and tolerant
atmosphere than the one now existing
at Davidson. these spontaneous out-
bursts of self-expression would come
more frequently of their own accord
as the stigmas attached to individual-
ity and novelty disappeared.

Several positive steps can be tak-
en at this time to help bring such an
atmosphere to Davidson. The creative
writing course needs to be enlarged,
and the new Scripts ‘n Pranks editor is
already beginning what may well be
the foundations for a creative writing
booklet. With the leadership poten-
tial. this year’s senior class has, it
seems strange that thev would content
themselves with playing no role what-
soever in their own graduation with
the exception of paying for a class gift.
Why disallow civil disobedience, a
concept based on Christian principles?
Why not hire .a few faculty members
with weird ideas?

These are only suggestions for
the beginning of a program which we
hope will eventually lead to the atmos-
phere we speak of—-an atmosphere
which not only tolerates, but actively
encourages genuine expression of
creative and original thought.

Ruinous Science Complex

BY RICK von UNWERTH
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Since the days of the original Renaissance Man,
gentlemen of quality have trained themselves in ‘a var-
iety of disciplines.. Rabelais’ world-renowned Gargantua,
in that famous letter, exnorted his son Pantagruel to
learn “all there is to be had,” and to return from his
studies an “abysm of science.” For several centuries now,
the wise have sought acquaintance with the natural
sciences as the sine qua non of erudition.

At Davidson we pursue this aim. Eight hours of a
science are required in the make-up of the Davidson Pro-
duct, and rightfully so. Some liberally oriented minds,
however, are apparently not geared for detail; some of
us. notably those in Biology 12A, find the acquisition of
natural principles (however rewarding) a ceaseless source
of frustration. The maze of facts and fancy nomenclature
is wreaking our destruction:

Benign, the beast surveys his cage . .
What obstacle can daunt this sage!”

A step, ’til now, in any plane

Had served to assuage éach simple pain

No corner sniffed aroused sensation.
Mindless of his situation

The beast conducted leisure quest,

And each time stymied, stopped to rest.

Wand’ring now, unruffled, feeling
Unperturbed the beast went reeling
Down the corridor with a grin...
That’s gone when he comes back again.

Once around to reconnoiter;

Strange . . . and now he doesn’t loiter,
Casting, with his nostrils wide

He turns to find... A place to hide?

Ears press tense in flat fear-quivers,
Cloying. agonizing shivers,

Met with unexperienced terror.
Neither comprehends his error. . .

What strange pass confronts the cowering,
Stricken beast with acid-souring

Spittle clogging tongue and nerve?

What inhuman power would serve

Such portion to this nameless wretch?
The beast convulsed. He ventured stretch
A limb to feel the awesome thing

That made his cold flesh throb and ring.

An hour since he stood, was warm,
Secure in innocence of harm.

But now the dread wall loomed before
Him, heard his cry “Where is the door?”

With leering malice. and in hearing
Whimpered pleas. stood rudely jeering.
Mocking harsh and cold deniak,
“Beast. you’ve got lo stand your trial.”

Whining, mad the beast arose,

His being clutched in frenzied throes
Of wild frustration, gnashing, gnawing,
He fell to with frenetic clawing.

Finding this to no avail

He leapt up. lashed out with his tail
And hurled his frothing body crashing
At the tyrant. Mangled, thrashing,

Helpless, roiling flesh insane,
The Beast could not get up again.
* % :

Perhaps this isn’t a fair analysis. Maybe the sequel
to this pitiable tale will bring the resolution of the vic-
tim’s frustrating dilemma. New light may yet dawn. Haste.
however, is imperative—the time of the fallen leaf, the
yellow sear (as it were) of the semester is upon us, and
the sky over General Biology looks awfully dark from

ere.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR...

Goodykooniz

Dear Editor:

I do not suppose thet anyone
who has closely examined my
display in the Stowe Gallery will
need to be told that the Presi-
dent’s statements in last week’s
DAVIDSONIAN are open‘ to
question on a number of facts.

1 write under some handicaps
because I do not want to sub-
ject the editor of THE DAVID.
SONIAN or his reporters to fur-
ther attempts by President Mar-
tin’s administration to intimi-
date them.

But since there are readers of
THE DAVIDSONIAN who live
at a distance and who have no
way to check the accuracy of the
President’s statements. I must
point. out one serious error ot
fact: 1 did not direct. “a great
deal” of ‘the material against
“the church,” “trustees.” “re
ligious -leaders.” or “good
friends of the college’—as the
President alleges, A careful
reading of the material on dis-
play will demonstrate to anyone
the gross {naccuracy of his
charge.

Since neither Dean Johnston
nor President Martin is willing
to debate the issues publicly.
and since, THE DAVIDSONIAN
is not free to reproduce much of
the material on display, 1 hope
all readers of THE DAVIDSON.
JAN. including altumni—as well
as trustees and religious leaders
—will make an effort to get all
the facts before forming judg-
ments.

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE
VAGABOND CRUSADERS:

Why the uproar, Dr. Goody-
koontz? Why the wrathful indig-
nation, Messrs. Trotter and

Chumbley?

Why don't you face the issue
realisti¢ally and admit that
there is a large element, prob-
ably the greater preponderance
of the Davidson College Com-
munity, which does not care a
hoot whether the Vagabond or-
ganization lives on or fades into
oblivion?

Please don't try to burden us
with fine arts and culture. Don’t
try to stir us from our pedes-
trian pursuits. We are content
to finish our days at Davidson
in pleasant apathy toward all
things cultural. intellectual,
dramatic, and “arty.” Die quiet-
ly, and leave us undisturbed in
our painless: surface existence!

Richard E. Levy

Thompson
Davis

Dear Editor:

It would seem that Dr. Goody-
koontz has outdone himself in
his new “production” in the
Fine Arts Building. All his other
productions fade. into insignifi-
cance when compared to this
new and completely original
tragedy.

Yes, the production in the
Fine Arts Building is a tragedy.
It is a tragedy to: see the new
building with all its facilities,
which were intended to give
Davidson a better fine arts pro-
gram, degenerate into a show
place for slanderous sensational-
ism. It is a tragedy to witness
the degeneration of a genius in-
to a frustrated old man.

And all the audience seems to
react—in spite of a few sad
smiles or snickers at the small
amount of humor—with pathos.
That is, the audience is filled
with pity and awe—and above
all the feeling of helplessness
that there is nothing they can

do to end this destructive tirade.

Dear Editor:

During the past’ two weeks an
issue has been developing at
Davidson which greatly con-
cerns us students. It is between
Dr. Goodykoontz and the admin-
istration,

In a series of letters to THE
DAVIDSONIAN Dr.  Goody-
koontz and two students have
raised questions about the
school’s support of drama, de-
bate, and creative writing. Their
questions strike at the heart of
a problem we must face—the
problem of creativity at David-
son.

Dr. Goodykoontz has set up
a display of material in the
Cunningham Fine Arts Build-
ing supporting his criticisms.
He has also agreed to discuss
the problem of creativity at
Davidson in an open forum
with the president and any
other members of the admin-
istration willing to partici-
pate.

The president has been asked
twiee to participate in this for-
um and has refused both times.
Many students are deeply con-
cerned that the question of
creativity at our school cannot
be openly discussed. 1f the ad-
ministration has valid answers
to the questions being raised.
why are they refusing to publi-
cally present them in such a
forum?

Unless this discussion is ar-
ranged in the next few days we
at Davidson may lose a very
great English professor next
year and with him the hope for
a successful program in the
fine arts.

support is called for). There
must be complete agreement
as to the goals and the means
to those goels ahead of time.

Dear Editor:

The administration - Goody-
koontz controversy is apparent-
ly simmering now and I think
the time is ripe for a real exa-
mination of the issues raised in
the display.

The main question that the
display originally asked was,
“How can a creative atmosphere
be attained at Davidson?” Some
of the answers pointed to were
through an all-literary magazine,
a full drama program, and an
active debate team. This week
Hank Ackerman initiated a
study on the possibilities of an
all-literary magazine. separate
from Scripts 'n Pranks. But what
do a full drama program, an
active debate team, and a host
of other creative programs (such
as a writer-in-residence) involve?

Primarity they involve a
concrete administrative com-
mitment to a real program

(especially since monetary

PEANLUIS

For this reason, I propose that
a forum be arranged involving
the president and another mem-
ber of the administration to
clarify these goals and exactly
what needs to be done to reach
them. A two-way exchange be-
tween the students and the ad-
ministration would be beneficial
to both sides and would focus
needed attention on the parti-
culars of the future.

The main issue at stake is not
a budget of. the past or person-
alities of the present. (Though
the fact that Davidson has lost
one of her finest teachers cannot
be overlooked.). The issue is
what will be done to stimulate
an atmosphere of intellectual
creativity in the future.

The complexity and import-
ance of the issue demands that
it be given a public hearing.
