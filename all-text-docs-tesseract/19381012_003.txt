Melvin Means, Junior:

I think flowers are all right for
all but mid-winters, where the price
is so much higher. The rule should
be general, however, and not op-
tional. " Usuallp there are a lot of
other expenses like fraternity ban-
quets and girls’ meals in addition to
the ticket. A good band would
make up for the lack of flowers.

Kenneth McLean, Senior:

I think it is a boy's prerogative
to decide whether he shbduld give
his date flowers or not. Conse-
quently, it should be left up to him
alone. Davidson has only four

your esteem and admiration for the
young lady who is your guest for

Dr. Lingle Talks For
Sunday School Rally

Sunday October 9, Dr. W. L.
Lingle delivered a talk for the
First Presbyterian Church at Shel-
by, N. C., in connection with their
annual Sunday School Rally Day.

On next Sunday he is to speak
at the Unity Presbyterian Church
at Fort Mill, S. C., in connection
with the celebration of the Sesqui-
Centennial Founding of the Church
and the dedication of their new re-
ligious education building.

He plans to deliver an address
at a meeting of the Colonial Dames
at the Woman's Club in Charlotte

on Saturday, Oct. 15.

A man should never be ashamed
to own that he has been in the
wrong; it is but saying, in other
words, that he is wiser today than
he was yesterday.

We feel that the men of the
South, who are themselves native

and consideration to the pfoblem

institutions of this section ug

The Alumni bulletin ‘states that
Davidson College is the kind of
institution described by Dr. Mc-
Connell. The founders of David-
son were born back in the days of
George Washington, Thomas Jeff-
erson, James Madison, and
great Southern statesmen.

If Davidson is expected to con-
tinue to keep step with educational
progress she will’have to be given
more adequate equipment for her
second century task than she had
for her first century.

Some of the more urgent needs
of Davidson College are: a new li-
brary; a new science building; a
new church; more playing fields;
a new gymnasium; a new dormi-
tory; a social center; a greatly in-
creased endowment.
