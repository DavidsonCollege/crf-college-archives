The Davidson Men's tennis
team boosted its overall record
to 13-2 with an impressive 6-3
victory over Atlantic Christian..
This win capped a week and a

half of undefeated team play in °

which th Cats won sixty-seven
individual matches and lost
only four.

Nevertheless, Coach Frank
wishes some of these matches
were closer. He stated,
turally, I’m happy that we are
playing well enough to win by
such lopsided scores, but we are
not trying to run the score up on
our opponents.” Frank pulled
each player in the top six out of

at least one match for rest and -

often switched the doubles.

Trackmen win again

By JOHN DAVIS
Staff Writer

The Davidson track team
upped its record to 3-0 last
Saturday, sloshing to a 96-66
win over Lynchburg College on
a cold, wet afternoon which was
reminiscent of the grim weather
so frequently in evidence last
January.

Apparently very much at
home in the all-too-familiar
environs, the Wildcats man-
aged to record some of their
best times and distances of the
season, and, after repeatedly
trading the lead with Lynch-
burg during the initial phase of
the meet, the team outscored its
opposition 42-13 in the last
eight events to register its most
impressive victory of the year.

Junior Carl MacPhail, whose
versatility is rivaled only by his
seemingly boundless energy in
running from one event to the
next, scored 19% points in
winning the triple jump, the
high jump, and the 400 meter
intermediate hurdles, taking
second in the high hurdles, and
running a leg on the victorious
mile relay team. *¥

Davidson's distance team al-
so performed well. Captain

and the steeplechase while Coty
Pinckney, after valiantly kick-
ing down the home stretch to
finish a close.second to Lynch-
burg ace Ken Brady in the 1500
meter, easily captured the 5000
meter in yet another school
record clocking (15:44.2).

In the weights, Jarry Taylor
was granted the opportunity to
throw his specialty, the hammer
for the first time this year, and
the massive senior managed a
fling of 138’5”, bettering his
nearest opponent by more than
30 feet.

In addition to the men’s
competition, an intrepid little
band of twelve Davidson wo-
men opposed a larger and more
experience female squad from
Lynchburg and managed to put
up a very respectable battle in
losing, 59:39.

Freshman Nancy Wright led
the Wildcattes, taking first in
the 1500 meter and second in
the 400 meter.

Davidson's next meet is April
1, when the trackmen face
Appalachian State at Boone.
The following Saturday the
college hosts the Davidson Re-
lays in which approximately
thirty schools will participate.
