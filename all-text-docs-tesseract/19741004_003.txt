Campus Counselors Facilitate
Interpersonal Relationships

(Ed. Note: This is the first installment of a three-
part series on counseling at Davidson.)

Davidson College has contracted for services with
three clinical psychologists this year to deal with
studént problems and to heighten the degree of
emotional development on campus.

Meredith Hall and Amelia Dockery will handle
the counseling duties during fall term, with W.
Gatewood Workman, presently 6n sabatical in
Europe, joining the staff during winter and spring
quarters. The college has contracted for the
equivalent of one day of service per week from each
psychologist. In addition, the SGA Senate has con-
tracted with Hall to provide an additional day of

Dockery.

counseling for students.

Hall and Dockery share an office in Phi Hall. Ac-,

cording to Dean of Students Will R. Terry, Dockery
will be on eampus Monday mornings and all day
Wednesdays while Hall will continue his counseling
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Terry indicated that appointments should be
made through Catherine Wilson in the student coun-
seling office in the basement of Chambers or by
calling extension 233 for Dockery or extension 234
for Hall.

“‘We’ve got all of the elements for an excellent
counseling program. Now we’ve got to make it
work,” said Vice President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan.

“I’m very happy that Meredith Hall is working
for two days a week. He knows the students and the
institution, and has from all reports been tremen-
dously effective in the past,’’ said Bevan. ‘‘I am also
very pleased to have Mrs. Dockery with us this
year. I feel that it is beneficial to introduce a woman
figure in our counseling progam,’’ Bevan added.

College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. is op-
timistic about student counseling services. ‘‘In ef-
fect, we have twice as much counseling and more
Options for students,’’ Spencer said.

Workman will join the counseling staff winter
quarter-as a:part-time psychologist and part-time
professor of psychology. According to a study Work-
man has made in past years, he felt that there
needed to be counselors closely tied with academia
as well as ones with little or no formal relationship
with the campus academic circles. He felt that this
counseling program would best meet the needs of
students on the Davidson campus.

Both Hall and Dockery emphasized that they
were not here to work only with students who have
great emotional problems.

“I don’t want to be only the ‘counseling-problem-
person’ ’’said Hall. I’m very concerned about
working with the person who is functioning well, but
wants to develop himself further emotionally.”

Dockery said, ‘‘I do not see counseling as being a
need for therapy. I think the majority of students
here are well-balanced and don’t need therapy. I see
counseling as a way to improve relationships bet-
ween students, faculty and administration,” she ad-
ded.

‘“My specific interest is to help people here find a
way to happiness. If a student is unhappy, he may
want to talk to someone.

“My unique role is to build a system of giving
students the opportunity to come and discuss
problems or just to talk with a person oriented: to
character analysis-a student may just want to
come in to discuss a movie,”’ Dockery added.’

““We cover the whole week. Although one of us will
be in the office Monday through Thursday, anytime
that I’m in Davidson, i’m available. Sometimes a
crisis occurs, and a s! udent needs to see someone
now. He can’t wait until next week,” Dockery said.

Hall Discourages Denying Emotions

(Ed. Note: The following ar-
ticle by Campus Clinical
Psychologist Meredith Hall is
an outgrowth of the seminar
he conducted last year on the
quality of emotional life at
Davidson with some fresh ob-
servations and reflections for
this academic year.)

It has been my experience to
share people’s personal lives
for nearly a decade and a half.

Living closely with other

people in this sense has had
definite impact 6n my life and
thoughts. I have often wanted
to share my reactions and ob-
servations with others.

While there is a part of me
that feels I have something to
say, there are ,other parts
which have resisted my ex-
pression of my thoughts.

Basically I know I want to
share some of my feelings and
ideas, but I remain unsure
that others will want to hear
them or if my expressions will,
be of value to others. I now
want to take the risk of finding
out.

It is often evident to me that
concerns I have for others are
often quite related to my own
feelings.

Nonetheless, my experience
in working ‘in a_ helping
relationship with . others
makes me feel that many in-
diviuals live a rather lonely
and isolated life. A life that
has a substantial amount of ef-

‘fort placed in concerns about

other reactions.

Recently I had to go to Will
Terry and share a concern
over my office space. I was
deeply aware of how petty I
appeared and of my desire not
to be seen as petty. In truth, I

am petty about some things

and relaxed about others.

It is very important to me
that I be. myself. Un-
fortunately, being me also i in-
volves not wanting to be me-
which complicates things.

I have often been impressed
by people’s (and my own)
valuations of feelings. Some
feelings are seen as cheap and

others quite valued.

It has been a profound if of-
ten wispy learning for me that
my feelings and others’ have
no real hierarchy of value
They seem to me to exist, my
lovingness, my jealousy, my
empathy, my shyness, my
courage and cowardice are all
parts of me.

Again it is unfortunate that
this learning is often more in-
tellectually based rather than
experientially maintained’ in
responding to my own
feelings.

It has been my continuing
experience with people that
they seek an intellectual or

rational evaluation of their
motivations. This may be done
with more sophistication with
individuals of higher
education.

It has been brought home to
me that when I and others are
living in the most deeply
satisfying manner, we trust
our feelings to our awareness.
This is done with an emphasis
on what rather than why.

Infrequently I can know my
jealousy without bringing
forth justifications. I can
sense my feelings or discom-
fort without running to disco-
ver why I feel this way.

All too often I find a line of
reasons why i feei the way ido
and either reasons to support
feeling that way or reasons

. why I should not.

Many of the people I share
this with may have a much
deeper commitment to logic
than I do.

My own life and I believe a
deep. awareness of other
people’s lives has led me to the
belief that logic rests most of-
ten upon an emotional base in
vitally important personal
issues. Unlike Freud and some
others, I do not feel my
emotional base is negative or
anti-social.

While I have experienced
hatred, I have also ex-
perienced love. This ihe

‘me to something very
portant to me. sped

that my greatest mistakes and
personal disasters have come
from denying my feelings.

People can reply with “Then
you think you should expose
your feelings no matter what?

But this is really hot what I
mean. I want to know when I
am angry, when I am petty,
confused, or at my limit. This
does not mean I express com-
plete and pure angry—for it
has been my personal
discovery that when I gain an
accepting awareness of my
feelings, I do not tend to ex-
press them in as nearly a hurt-
ful-manner-as- when they are
disguised to me.

Another personai iearning
for me has been that there are
few times.a pure and complete
feeling exists within me. It has
been a high point of my
humanness to experience both
anger and love in proximity’
and to accept both as my
feelings, not to force a closure
on these feelings.

For I have been taught to be
consistent ‘and tov-condone no
