Athletics vs. Academics: the battle of the budget

|

PHILADELPHIA, PA
(CPS) --As  college-and univer-
sity budgets tighten, and tui-
tion and students fees rates
rise, resentment over the fund-
ing of intercollegiate athletics
departments seems to be grow-
dent and faculty reports critical
of athletic departments’ rela-
tively large budgets have sur-
faced on at least 14 campuses
this academic year.

The most recent report re-
leased was here at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, and, as
has happened at other shcools,
widespread controversy has fol-
lowed.

Penn's Faculty Advisory
Committee (SAC), which is the
guiding body for the Faculty
Senate, issued a report last
month as part of a univeristy-
wide review of athletic policy.

It states that ‘‘continued
participation in the Ivy League

‘does not require that the pre- .

sent scope of Penn’s program of
intercollegiate athletics be main
tained.’’ The report recom
mends that the athletic budget
be frozen for a three-year per-
iod, that the number of coaches
be reduced, and that special
athletic admissions be permit-
ted only for the spectator sports

of football, basketball, and
soccer. ; '
SAC said its proposal would
Save money, and improve the
quality of the student body.
Five percent of Penn’s stu-
dent body can, under present
rules, be admitted under a
_ special admissions procedure

for athletes.. They are students,

who, moreover, probably would
not be accepted at Penn under
normal procedures. Similar spe-
cial admissions procedures exist
for lower socio-economic groups
and for faculty children. Much
of the debate that followed the
SAC report has centered around
the admissions question.

Mark Lerner, chairman of the
Undergraduate Assembly, cal-
led the faculty report ‘‘short-
sided and irresponsible.” The
Student Task Force on Ath-
letics assailed the report, citing
‘unsubstantiated as-
sumptions”’ and mourning that
the way it was released ‘‘may
cause lasting damage to the
image of the uniyersity.’’ It said
SAC was wrong for considering
admissions in the context of a
report on athletics.

“Special admissions,’’ added
univeristy trustee Robert Levy,
“are a part of this university,
and a part of the Ivy League.”’

The admissions questions,
and the issue of intercollegiate
athletic financing, arose from a
university Budget. Committee
report last spring that found
deficits in the athletic depart-
ment.and a campus arts center.
The committee said both would
have to be reduced. As the
result, the school dropped its
hockey program, and the arts
center eliminated its profes-
sional theater program. A sub-
sequent students sit-in at the
Administration Building led to
a renaissance of the theater
program, but the hockey pro-
gram was never reconsidered.

Such money questions have
become more common. Yale and
Princeton also have financial
problems in their athletic de-
partments. At Fort Hays State
in Kansas, students marched on
campus last spring when the
sports department asked for
more thn 50 percent of the
student fees budget, up from 39
percent the year before. They
complained that only 30 percent
of the student body directly
benefitted from the intercollegi-
ate sports program, while the
remainder supported it through
fees and tuition payments.

A similar protest took place
at Kent State last February.
