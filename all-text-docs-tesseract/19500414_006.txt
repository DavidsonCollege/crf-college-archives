Art-Travel Workshop
Sponsors Tour

A new opportunity for summer
travel and art study is being offer-
ed by the Mexican Art Workshop
which has successfully conducted
an arts project in Mexico for the
past three years. In addition to the
Mexican Workshop, a European
Arts Tour has been arranged which
also combines art appreciation and
painting with the experience of liv-
ing in a foreign country.

Personally escorted by a promi-
nent American painter and design-
ed for a seven-weeks period, the
European Arts Tour includes leis-
urely visits to museums and galler-
jes in Holland, Belgium, Italy and
France for art appreciation and
discussions. A two weeks resi-
dence in a villa on the Normandy
coast for painting and recreation
is a special feature of the trip. De-
parture by airplane is scheduled for
July 2nd. The all inclusive cost is
$1107.00, An alternative “student
sailing” via Cunard Line, June 15,
on which only limited accommoda-
tions are available, is priced at
$1187.00 for a ten-weeks period.

The Mexican project covers five
weeks of travel, sightseeing and art
study. The popular and familiar
Mexican Art Workshop, conduct-
ed in Taxco under the personal
supervision of Carlos Merida, prom-
inent Mexican artist, will again
provide instruction in painting and
the Spanish language. The crafts
work is carried on directly in the
native silver, tin and textile shops,
for whose products Taxco is a fa-
mous center. Priced at $300.00, the
tour includes instruction, field trips,
and all first class living costs with-
in Mexico for the period July 10
to August 14. (Transportation to
Mexico is not inclyded.)

responded to accordingly. There
has been an average crowd of about
60 persons per night and the total
attendance so far this year has
reached the 1,600 mark. Response
to such programs increases with
warmer weather; so, we expect to
pass the 2,000 mark in attendance

before the school year is over.

Much credit for the gratifying re-
sponse which we have experienced
in our Movies is due to the Film

furnished the “Y” with such added

of current world interests, and
travelogues of each Southern and
Eastern State, as well as of the
South as a whole.

thing in the manner least expected.
Most of the time he can be seen
doing anything: from watching the
latest at the local theater to per-
forming on the horizontal bar in

the gym, that is, except when one
is looking for him. On such occa.
sions he is believed to hide out
either in the attic of the KA house
or under Dr. Richard’s porch.

The benefits of his originality

ate not limited to the KA’s. Such
inventions as the “double wham-
my” eyés he displayed during the
Red and Black game were for the

benefit of humanity in general. His
present ambition is to construct a

yoyo out of inner tubes and rope,

that he can operate from the fourth
floor of West, This might be de-
veloped in about his sixth year in
school, he says.

Hal's ideal for life after he grad-
uates next year is that of a coun-
try doctor. He wants to live out of
the city so that he can raise horses
and dogs for fox hunting. Tak.
ing a realistic view on his future,
Hal says that if his ambition
doesn’t work out he and Ansel
Moses will go back to making mu-
sic for a living.

enough of the general, let us delve
into the particular. Mr. Piltdown is
warming his ape-like hands in
front of the Bendix gas heater as
Mrs, P. and their son are working
over his braille homework. Mrs. P.
speaks: .

“Oh Java, I do wish you had a
cranial capacity of more than 1070
cubic centimeters. Just look at the

wish you had a father like that?”

Mr. P. flexes the prehistoric mus-
culature of his comparatively low
forehead and gritted his not yet
completely ontogeniyed front
teeth.

“Now Nora, you know good and
well I just finished painting two
Vago (calender) buffaloes on our
walls. Besides that I polished some
slivers of flint to put in your Ron-
son cigarette lighter.”

ed last year, a group of students in
the Biology Department here at
Davidson used the spring holidays
for a field trip to central Florida.
Dr, Tom Daggy was in charge of
the trip designed primarily as a
survey of Florida botany but also
planned to include study’ of birds,
mammals, reptiles, and amphibians,

The route of the trip led down
the east coast to Titusville, across
the state to the west coast, and back
through Gannesville. Starting from
Davidson the group drove to Sa-
vannah to reach the first point ot
interest, a U. S. government ex-
perimental station specializing in
research into the practical uses of
many types of bamboo. Besides the
endless varieties of bamboo arrang-
ed in small plots, other plants from
palms to Chinese water nuts are
grown.

St. Augustine was chosen as an
excellent place to study the va-
rious palms. Here may be found
all of the Florida species except a
few ‘of the more tropical forms.

mammals of the region for the
study collection maintained by the
Biology Department. Specimens of
rats and mice from beach, scrub,
and hammock situations were col-
lected besides a raccoon and an
opossum found killed on the high-
way.

The chill nights reduced the
number of reptiles and amphibians
seen or caught by the group. One
warm night in the lake district
brought out frogs in large numbers,
but very few snakes and lizards
were seen during the trip.

Because of the many different
habitats visited, the party was able
to see a wide variety of bird life.
Shore birds, marsh birds, birds of
the open fields, and birds of the
deep woods helped to swell the to-
tal number of species observed to
