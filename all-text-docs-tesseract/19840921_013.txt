dd experience
to your degree.

The world can be big
and bad for some. For others it
looks much easier Survival
means different thing's to
different people. Is it luck or
preparation?

Preparation seems
to be the key. Consider the
leadership training: and
management skills you can
develop in Army ROTC. The
edge. That margin of difference
that can put vou ahead in the
big, bad world of tough job
competition.

You may bea
sophomore. Or have just two
vears remaining in school. Itâ€™s
not too late to add Army
ROTC. And add experience to
vour degree. Contact
