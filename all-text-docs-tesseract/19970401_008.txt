8 THE DAVIDphONIAN

J ust after finishing his latest

shit, the Unacrapper drops
nuggets of wisdom on the
Davidphonian’s backpage...

T.P.Charmin: Hi, Unacrapper.
What’s up?

Unacrapper: Whoever has my
Japanese red maple tree had bet-
ter give it back. I’m trying to be
as polite as Ican be. Just leave it
on the rugby field and there will
be no questions asked. If it’s not
returned, I’m gonna find out who
you are and hunt you down.
Ronald Reagan once told terror-
ists, “you can run but you can’t
hide.” Well, that applies here.

TPC: Right. So it’s an artist in
angst thing.
U: One mad son of a bitch.

TPC: Why express yourself
excrementally?
U: It’s free.

TPC: Ah. So, are you facing
some financial difficulties ?

U: Is that really any of your
damn business? The next thing
you know you’re going to be
asking me about my mother. I
love my mother. I mean, who
doesn’t? Is there something
wrong with you or something?
You’reimplying thatI don’tlove
my mother, and I just don’t think
that’s true. [love my mother just
plenty, and she loves me too.
I’m her favorite person, except
for Santa Claus. She told me so,
okay? Can we just end this inter-
view? You’re hurting my feel-
ings now.

TPC: Excuse me. I didn’t mean
for things to get too Freudian
here. Imean, we’re talking shit,
not mothers, right? Right. Now
tell the interested readers what
kind of foods you have to con-
sume to produce such massive
quantities of shit. I mean, you
shit a lot.
U: Well, it’s not the kind of food
as much as the amount of food.
When I decided to become the
Unacrapper, I walked around
barefoot until I got a tapeworm.
That way, I could eat all I wanted
without having to worry about
all those goddamn calories. I
don’t have to count fat grams
either. Anyway, I love me that
Commons food, let me tell you.
Especially Shepherd’s Pie and
Student Steaks. You wanna
know a trick? You eat with a
bunch of chicks, and they’ Il give
you their tickets, and that way,
_ you can eat like eight steaks,
instead of just one. If you take
X-Lax before your meal, you

can shit throughout the entire
thing and just keep the extra in a
ziplock bag for later. Not that I
mean to endorse Ziplock or any-
thing. I mean, the generic brand
of zipper bags is just as good as
the commercial brand as far as
storing shit goes.

TPC:

vomit.
U: That’s a damn shame. It’s
never been my desire or plan to
make anyone want to vomit.
What I want is to make you want
to shit.

You make me want to

TPC: Well, you just make me
want to vomit. Maybe I'll start a
new art form. Anyway. I was
wondering if you had to stay
away from any foods that might
identify you. You know, like
corn. Or that tasty purple drink
they always mix at fun Court
parties. You know how it makes
your shit green?

U: Dol

Listen, you lousy interviewer,
don’t even get me started about
how much my mother loves me.
She loves me a hell of a lot more
than yours loves you. Did you
ever see that movie with that guy
and that chick about that thing
that happened out there? Well,
it’s like that, and don’t you for-
get it!

TPC: Whoa now, calm down
Una. May I call you Una? or do
you prefer Mr. Crapper? I’m
not trying to belittle you here.
I’mon your side. I’m not going
to forget it. I just want to get to
the bottom of things, so to speak...
U: Get to the bottom of things.
Exactly. That’s exactly what
I’m trying to do :.. Well, you
could ‘say that I’m trying to get
below the bottom of things ...
I’ mtrying to understand the uni-
verse as it relates to me. The
way I do that is through feces, I
love feces. Let’s get to the bot-

know
how it
makes me
shit
green?
Friend,
let me tell
you, I
know my
shit. Ican
tell you what every item at the
grocery store does to my shit,
and I enjoy all the different
shades and variations. Do I eat
corn? Sometimes, especially if
I’m trying to make a statement
about agriculture. It fucking
sucks how farmers get treated in
this country. They get no re-
spect whatsoever. Here they go,
growing the stuff that makes our
shit beautiful and varied in tex-
ture, color, and odor, and we
have to go and treat them like
second-rate citizens. It makes
me sick. I bet you mistreat farm-
ers, don’t you, you goddamn
snotty, rich, Davidson-loving
bastard, don’t you?

se

TPC: My mother’s a farmer.
Are you saying I don’t love my
mother. I love my mother, you
cock-sucking son of a bitch.
Everyone tries to act like I don’t
love my mother, but I do, God
damn it, and she loves me. She
tells me so every day. She tells
me so several times aday. Don’t
you go talking about my mother.
U: Your mother loves you?

According to “Foul Play: Serial defecator messes

YO’ MOMMA’S DAY

X _

with campus” by Teresa White in the September 3, 1996
issue of the highly respectable publication, The Davidsonian,
the criminal known by residents and police as the
Unacrapper began his shitting in Love Auditorium and then
later in the first floor men’s bathroom in Chambers, where
workers found feces smeared and thrown on the walls and

ceiling.

Later more excrement was found in several places in
the senior apartments, including floors, desk drawers, sofas,

and beds.

Since the summer, the Unacrapper has been on
sabbatical, spreading his crap elsewhere and surprising
others with his creative and gut-wrenching work.

The Davidphonian sent special investigator T. P.
Charmin to pick up the latest scoop from Davidson’s most
feared, revered, and weird student exhibitionist. :

TPC: Socreativity is what you're
all about? I’ve heard that so far
you’ve shat in over a half dozen
places. What’s your motive?
How do you choose? How do
you create?
U: Well, I think about my inspi-
rations. I have lots, and one is
Dr. Seuss. I

tom of things ... I like the way
your attitude is improving, you
slimy son of a bitch.

TPC: Um. Thanks. Who would
you say you’re most influenced
by?

U: Well, I’ ve always had a lot of
respect for Herb Jackson, but as
far as people who are full of shit
go, I'd have to say ... Damn,
that’s a really tough one. Andy
Cole’s a. real asshole, but he
doesn’t have enough of a per-
sonality to inspire me, per se.
Polly Griffin and Tom Shandley
are pretty vibrant people, now
that I think about it.

TPC: Really? I would think by
the way you targeted the senior

. apartments that you had Kurt

Holmes in mind.

U: Um... Ican’t believe that you
figured me out. He’s the apple
of my eye, the Picasso to my
Bob Ross. Let’s paint some
happy shits. Paint some crap
here if you want, but if you don’t
want to, don’t paint it. It’s your
world. Be creative.

would crap

I would
crap on a
mouse, I
would crap
in a boat, I
would crap
on a goat, I
would crap
on a bed, I
would crap on yourhead, [would
smear it on the walls, I would
smear it on my balls, I would

residence hall, I would crap on
the roof, I would crap on a ge-
ometry proof, I would crap a
huge stink bomb, I would crap
all-over your mom. I heard she
likes that.

TPC:. Youheardwrong. Check
your sources motherfucker.

U: I’ve got your source right
here, you fucking son ofa whore!

My source is named Larry, and —

he’s a green Martian that only I
‘can see. Take that, you cock
smoker! Larry, tell me about
this fucker’s mom ... Larry says
your mom [edited for the sake of
the weak at heart].

‘TPC: You say another thing
about my mother and I'll beat

the living shit out of you, you
worthless piece of crap. You
think you’re so cool. You think
you're artistic. You think that
you’re worthacrap. But really
you’re just another crazy bas-
tard not worth any more than
those damn duct-taped sofas in
the VAC. Go use that as an
enema, UnaSUCKER.

U: Unasucker? UnaSUCKER?
Listen, you rotten rod-slurping
fuck, you could suck a golf ball
through a cocktail straw. Sure,
I’ve sucked my share, but that’s
not what I’m about. I’m about
crapping. Crapping is impor-
tant. When I crap, when I purge
what’s inside me, I’m expelling
all of the dirt and filth within my
soul. I’m expunging the pain
and decay I feel within myself.
I’m trying to show the world the
one true way to enlightenment,
the way of expulsion and cleans-
ing. Then you have to go and
bring up that stuff about me be-
ing the UnaSUCKER.

That’s in my past. Won’t
you let me forget my past?
What’s wrong with you people?
Don’t you have a heart at all?
Don’t you care about the fact
that I’m a human fucking being
sitting here before you, and
whether or not I’ ve sucked in the

past means nothing compared to

what I’m doing now, and that’s
crapping.

You don’t understand at all,
do you? You probably hold in
your shit, or if you expel it, it’s
probably in private, far away
from others. Well, suck this,
shit-hider. I’m on a plane of
existence and understanding that
you can only dream about.
