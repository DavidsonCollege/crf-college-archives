forged into the Big Five lead last
week by virtue of a close 41-39 win
over Duke and a screaming 46-39
victory Carolina’s smooth
working Sophomores.

Duke's “never - a - dull - moment”
boys fell before a last minute of-
fensive onslaught by the Wildcat
quintet to lost by two points on
Thursday night. Davidson led 21-20
at the intermission, and the battle
was nip-and-tuck all the way up to
the very end. During the clash nev-
er was there more than 4 points
difference separating the two teams,
but it was the ability of the ’Cats
to ring free throws that decided the
game. Jim Cowan and Ned Iverson,
rangy center and forward, led the
scoring with 9 points apiece, while
Minor, Blue Devil forward, led the
scoring for the Durham lads with
8 points to. his credit.

Davidson vs. Carolina

J. D. Hicks, scrappy guard, and
Johnny Tice, diminutive star, pac-
ed the high-flying Wildcats to a
rather handy win over the White
Phantom quintet. Hicks led sthe
with fifteen points, while
Tice was not far behind with
thirteen. At times the Phan-
toms showed their lack of experi-
ence, but during most of the en-
counter they presented a well-bal-
anced, sharp-shooting aggregation.
George Glamack, six-foot, five-in-
ch center, led the Carolina scorers
with 11 points, but it was Bill Mc-
Cachren, Charlotte lad, who led
the attack both offensively and de-
fensively. His smooth ball handling
and fast breaking kept the ’Cat de-
fenders always on the alert.

The Wildcats were never headed,
and the closest that Carolina came
was when they scored 8 quick
points to knot the score at 20-all
just before the half, but the ’Cats
soon took command to lead 27-23 at
the half-time. Right ‘at the start of
the second period Hicks bagged 3
quick field goals, and Tice basketed
6 straight free throws to get a com-
fortable lead that lasted the rest
of the game.
