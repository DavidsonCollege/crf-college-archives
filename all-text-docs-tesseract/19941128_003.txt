Forget the fruitcake.

For the person who has everything,

for presents that could save the world.

By Laura Jones

On Sunday, December 4, from
2:00 to 4:00 p.m., the Union is
sponsoring a community-wide
event to celebrate the holidays.
There will be Christmas music,
decorations, cookies, cider, and
donkeys from Haiti. Along with
the donkeys will be a multitude of
unique gifts available for purchase
for those special people in your
life.

The Chaplain’s office, the
Chapel Committe, and a host of
other student organizations, includ-

ing Patterson Court Houses and
religious groups, are sponsoring
the second annual Alternative Gift
Market with the theme “Give the
World a Christmas Present.” It is
the perfect opportunity to cover all
your Christmas shopping in one
stop. It is also a great way to
celebrate the act of gift giving ina
fresh and meaningful way.

Sophomores battle
second-year slump

By Randy Hartwell

Under the ironic acronym of
SLAC (Sophomore Life Action
Committee), Warren Buford,
Nicola Hartery, David Wick, and
other sophomore members of the
SGA are forming a committee to
take on various. problems and is-
sues that second-year students in-
variably face.

By taking action now, says
Buford, sophomores will be able
to learn about more immediate in-
terests as well as long range con-
cerns that will confront the Class
of '97 closer to its graduation date.

The committee sees three ob-
jectives as its main responsibilites.
First, there would be a sophomore-
led self-study to evaluate prob-

lems the class wants addressed
before becoming seniors. Second,
a series of talks given by juniors
and seniors, covering such issues
as major declaration, study abroad,
and hall counseling would be held
better to educate second-year stu-
dents on important choices that
will affect the rest of their time at
Davidson. Third, round table dis-
cussions would take place for
sophomores to talk about SGA is-
sues.

Buford sees these discussions
as “a way for sophomore SGA

‘members and non-SGA sopho-

mores to get together.”” The com-
mittee is open to all sophomores.
Those interested should contact
Buford at -6026.

for sale. Some of you may remem-
ber the water buffaloes from last
year’s Market. As shoppers pur-
chase these gifts, they receive
Christmas cards with their gifts
inscribed, ready to mail or deliver
as alternative gifts for family or
friends. Donors, card recipients,
and people in need all around the
world receive joy at Christmas as a
result of these purchases. Simple
gift, like food, medical assistance,
and clean water, are a means of
survival for many.

Harriet C. Prichard is the
founder and president of Alterna-
tive Gift Markets, Inc. Started in
1980 in Pasadena, California, Al-
ternative Gift Markets now extend
across the United States. Hun-
dreds of churches, organizations
and schools will hold markets this
year. Prichard says, “The interna-
tional projects are life-giving, life-
saving, and life-extending, for all
races and religious groups. The
Markets offer shoppers the oppor-
tunity to preserve our endangered
planet as well as help hungry, sick
and homeless people - the world
around - help themselves.”

So forget the fruitcake. Come
to the Alternative Gift Market on
Sunday, December 4, in the Stu-

dent Union, as we challenge one.

SGA sends letters to trustees, not a vote

Pres. continued from page 2

vor of keeping the present require-
ment intact states that, “The presi-
dential tie with the Presbyterian
Church is part of Davidson’s foun-
dation; if taken away, the Davidson
we know, the Davidson we have
come to cherish, will begin to
crumble.”

The letter mentions that many
non-Presbyterian Davidson stu-
dents feel that the current by-law
makes sense for the sake of tradi-
tion. The opposition presents sta-
tistical evidence to suggest that the
requirement that the president be
an active Presbyterian creates
unneccessary exclusion of other-
wise qualified candidates, espe-
cially among African-Americans.
The letter also states that “a rule
regarding Presidential qualifica-
tions is not necessary to preserve
the tradition, and the trustees can

and will choose a Presbyterian
president if they wish.”

At the end of the letter,
Rosenbach requests that the trust-
ees contact him with any questions
about the-SGA’s work.

SGA still debates the topic

The SGA opened discussion
after every senator had read the
letter. Requests for grammatical
corrections were set aside and the
senators worked on correcting im-
balances between each side of the
issue.

There were also differences
of opinion regarding the validity
of some of the statistics, particu-
larly about the number of Presby-
terians in the United States.. The
SGA agreed to double-check the
figures before sending the letter.

The largest controversy cen-
ters around whether or not to in-
clude in the letter a tally of the
SGA’s opinions. Some senators

believe that a vote is an essential
indicator of whether or not the
students want the by-laws changed
and that without the inclusion of a
vote, the trustees will have no rea-
son to respond to the discussion at
hand.

Arguments against a vote in-
clude the assertion that on this
typé of issue, the senators could
not effectively represent their con-
stituents, that voting would under-
mine the purpose of presenting
both sides of the issue, and that the
representatives’ opinions may
change by the time the trustees get
back to the SGA.

Matthew Hobbie, a member
of the Chapel Committee, says, “I
will be glad this was brought up if,
as a result, we come to realize the
importance of the Presbyterian
Church in the history and life of
Davidson and that the president,
as a Presbyterian, preserves this.”

The Davidsonian is looking for a new staff to take over
for the spring semester. Call Leigh or Alex if you are
interested (-2148).
There are several positions available: business manager,
news editor, arts & living editor, and others.

A PLACE FOR DISCOVER Y

Mich Rhea. Most of their activi-
ties involve community service.
For example, they have given a
demonstration to the Parkview
| Elementary in Moorseville in ad-
dition to the demonstration at Dis-
covery Place. _

After giving the demonstra-

tions, the society has realized other
benefits. Steven Aldridge said
that the society allows “an excel-
lent opportunity for contact with
professors outside of the class-
rooms.”
Also, Currey enjoys watch-
ing the “children’s faces light up”
when the ice cream suddenly ap-
pears. Vice President Marcia
Payne believes that their demon-
strations “show children that they
can participate in science and that
it is not just an adult activity.”

Beeston, one of the profes-
sors involved, says,“I enjoyed
being part of a group of volun-
teers rather than the professor in

‘charge,” and she believes that it is

important for children to have “op-
portunities to do science and to
see scientists ‘in action’ in order
to nurture their interest.”

- The Davidson chapter took
placein the demonstrations at Dis-
covery Place along with other
chapters in the area, with UNCC’s
chapter being one of them.

The Davidson Chapter is cur-
rently working on a magic show
for children in their attempt to get
children involvedin science. Also,
some of the members are plan-
ning to go to California for the
national meeting. In addition to
these activities, Discovery Place
has invited them back anytime.
