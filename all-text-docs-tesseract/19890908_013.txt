conth his position on the
sidelines, Davidson men’s soc-
cer coach Charlie Slagle is
pleased with what he sees as
his team engages in.pre-prac-
tice warm ups and drills.

“These. guys really: worked
hard during the summer and
started practice in better shape
than any team I’ve coached at
Davidson,” he commented
with a smile.

Slagle is hoping that this

good conditioning will trans-
ate into.a winning season for

the Wildcats, who are coming
off an 8-12-2 1988 campaign.

‘The task will not be an easy

one. The Wildcats’ schedule is
a killer — including six teams
with legitimate Top 20 poten-
tial and a host of very ih 3a

. tive squads.

The grueling schedule will
be a test of the Wildcats’
mettle, but Davidson is
blessed with strong senior
leadership, especially captains
Tracy Hankins, Scott Poisson,

‘Ross Saldarini and Rob Vest.

This quality plus a wealth of
other experienced players
gives reason for optimism in
the Wildcat ranks. .
“This team will be much

better than last year’sand hasa
chance to be one of the best
ever at Davidson,” stated
Poisson. “We are very upper-
class oriented and that gives us
a lot of leadership. We also
have at least 15 players with
experience in game situ-
ations.”

Along with these character-
istics is a factor that was miss-
ing in 1988—depth. Hankins
and fullback Bruce Noffsinger
were outof action for nearly all
of last season, while injuries to
other players kept Slagle shuf-
fling, his lineup. A’ talented
crop of freshmen, including
starter Matt Spear, will help
allay those problems this fall.

“Last year, we were thin at
several positions. But I think
we are strong enough this sea-
son that we can withstand an
injury or two if we have to,”
said Slagle.

Much of the starting lineup
appears to be set, but there are
three spots still up in the air.

Rob Ukrop, who led the Wild-

cats in scoring last year as a
freshman, returns at. center
forward and Peter Cobb is
back at one wing. At the other
‘wing position, Lance. Kinerk,
Rob” ee and Jim Walker

The Davidson field hockey team shut out three opponents on Saturday’s “Club
Play Day.” The day’s action featured victories over the Charlotte Club (3-0), the
Durham Club (5-0) and Tobacco Road (1-0), No individual stats were kept for the
scrimmage matches, although all of the players saw action. A match. against a
touring English team, originally scheduled for Thursday, September 7, has been
cancelled. The Wildcats open the regular season Wednesday in a match at High
Point College.

are battling for the starting
berth. Hawkins, Vest and
Spear are in thecomprise the
midfield, with Saldarini at
stopper and Hankins’ and
Noffsinger filling the fullback
slots. Lance Long and Spider
Wormuth are in contention for
the sweeper position while
Doug Long and Scott Zucker
are the potential tigi: goal-
keepers.

The backbone of the team,
according to Slagle, is its talent
up the middle, particularly
Ukrop and the midfielders.
However, team speed, while

_ improved from 1988, remains

a key weakness in the
Davidson attack.

“Speed won't be as notice-
able as it was last year, but we
still aren’t as quick as some of
the teams that we play,” com-
mented Slagle. “We don’t give
scholarships and, well, speed
is a scholarship trait.”

Although Davidson
dropped its opening game of
the season 2-1 to Belmont-
Abbey September: 2, the opti-
mism remains among the
team.
