Just as wonderful, but now with a degree instead of a woolie!
You are my ray of sunshine everyday. As you leave Davidson, you
take with you amazing friendships, knowledge and self awareness.
I am so proud of all you have accomplished, and all that you have

given.
Congratulations Alex!
I love you always,
Mom
