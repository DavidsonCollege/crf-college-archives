College Comunity Must Respond
To Town-Gown Conflict

That Davidson College is a com-
munity not plagued by the foibles and
frailties of the human spirit has been
an ideal long cherished by many here.
To prove this to the avowed
disbeliever, one need only point to the
Davidson honor system, a respected
and effective institution, but one which
would have little hope for applicability
in the outside world.

However, the events of the past
weeks, including the rape of a coed and
the alarming increase in thievery,
have for some dashed this cherished
ideal to the ground, with all the
resultant suspicion and mistrust.

The blame has been variously af-
fixed to a number of groups, but the
one to which it is most commonly
assigned is the ‘‘townies’’, especially
the black element. In this process, the
hopes of many for a town-gown com-
munity in which brotherhood and trust
would be uniting bond has been
seriously damaged.

We do not feel that recent events
merit such a harsh conclusion, but
rather one based on a more objective,
realistic analysis of the situation.

Few people would deny that the
blessings of comfort and. prosperity
have been disproportionately spread
across the world, so that some find
themselves living in an opulence
unimaginable even a generation ago,
while others are forced to struggle to
survive.

One need only go as far as the
squalid dwellings of some of the David-
son townspeople to be struck by that
grim reality.

It would be totally unrealistic to ex-
pect these people not to hunger for the
same luxuries and pleasures which the

predominately white middle to up-

permiddle class America enjoys
especially when they can vicariously
experience those pleasures through the
medium of the television, which itself
can only taunt the less fortunate as it
entertains them.

However, to carry this argument to
the point where all such townspeople,
black and white, will steal at will or
rape at gunpoint to fleetingly ex-
perience these things is very wrong.

Admittedly there might be a small
element who could commit such acts
to gain a measure of satisfaction, but
the element must be thought of as just
that - small. One cannot allow such
thinking to explode into an across the
board judgment of disadvantaged
people in this community.

To the people that would deem rape
and theft justifiable under the
circumstances, we must show un-
derstanding rather than hate, for their
acts are symptomatic of a disease
curable only by human love and com-
passion.

Our advice for those within the im-
mediately Davidson College com-
munity, all of whom must somehow
deal with this problem, would be as
follows.

Do not flaunt your position, either by
travelling in unsafe areas or by
making your valuables easily ap-
propriated. Instead, use a little
discretion with regard to these mat-
ters, and act accordingly.

Do something in a positive sense to
alleviate this problem. Get involved in
some kind of activity which demon-
strates your sensitivity toward others.
For example, the YM/YWCA presents
an excellent chance to do just this, as it
offers a variety of educational and
recreational programs designed to
bridge the barriers between the college
and the town.

If you do not feel comfortable in such
a program, try something far simpler,
but equally effective. Instead of
ignoring those in the community whom
you do not know personally, give a
smile and say ‘‘Hello, how are you?"’

For even such a simple gesture as

this represents a step in the right direc-
tion.

The Fire Man Cometh

‘‘And God said, ‘In the beginning.
there was fire’.”’ And with that, the
Prophet of Fire Man insured that there
would be fire, flames the likes of which
Davidson had not yet seen.

On Tuesday night, Davidson wit-
nessed an assembly that is very much
indicative of a mood change that has
hit the campus this year. Some at-
tribute this change to the presence of
women.

Whether or not this is so, no one can
say, but whatever its causes, the ten-
sion, the self-consciousness and
perhaps some of the melancholy of the
Davidson experience are waning.

The performances of Fire Man.
Krishna, the Vestil Virgins, and the
hooligans, Captain America and Bucky
were attended by a crowd almost
medieval in appearance. Capes,
masks, bastard military dress and glit-
tered faces, lighted by roman candles
and torches, made this jesting, near-
Satanic rite enjoyable and thoroughly
insane.

Those who came were amused.
Perhaps this fact indicates a lack of
alternative activity, but perhaps it bet-
ter betrays a creeping, healthy
frivolity.

Students To Judge
JYA Opportunities

Fred Gaige already has
begun spreading his JYA
ropaganda among un-
Peteect freshmen and ee

tant sophomores. That’s i
job of course. Yet before fresh-
men and sophomores decide
that JYA takes them to the
Land of Milk and Honey, they
should examine both sides of
the program.

The first advantage that ap-
pears to the student lies in the
ability to leave the Davidson
campus for an entire year. An
entire year away from the
Thursday night boredom, the
weekend shutout and the Sun-
dav afternoon blahs.

The second advantage, and
one that can hardly be
overrated, comes from leaving
this country. Tie student who is
disgusted by the methods used
by the American government to
solve problems is able to learn
how other Western countries
solve similar problems.

The political activities around
these two universities afford ex-
cellent opportunities for un-
derstanding the French or Ger-
man governments.

The campuses of Marburg
and Montpelier are much more
exciting. They are large univer-
sities and offer many of the
social functions Davidson lacks.
The level of political activism at
these universities, especially
Marburg, is astounding.

Students at the JYA univer-
sities have an important role in
decisions reserved completely
for the faculty at Davidson.

Related to the political
enlightment is the ability to
view another culture and
society. The student is forced to
adjust to a new situation.

He is now the foreigner. He
must realize the underlying
assumptions that he has held
since his early vears.

The student is able to question
those assumptions by noticing
that the French or Germans do
not share these cultural
postulates.

This procedure of evaluation
and reconstruction of assump-
tions is effected with greater
ease during JYA than at David-
son,

Evaluation of the American
culture from within is almost

academic. Yet for the student
on JYA it is a very real part of
life. He must re-evaluate in or.
der to properly adjust to his new
situation.

We have already hinted at one
“tana te a

on campuses is
so widespread that there is no
way to avoid it.

Marxism , whichalwayssounds
nice here ,usually becomes
little more than an academic
pursuit.

Yet in Montpelier we see it as
an active and viable political
ideology . It is not only espoused
by the students but actively
worked for in the local political
arena. The political pursuits
creep into the life styles in Mar-

Students in Germany are
much more willing to live their
belief in Marxism outside the
political battles. This is an oc-
curence we see very little of on
the home campus.

The student majoring in a
language or studying topics in
literature gains more than
anyone else.

In understanding the in-
tricacies of the use of the
language, he may gain insights
into French or German
literature that could never
come from reading in tran-
slation or with a dictionary
always in hand. He may also
begin to understand the social
and cultural settings that
surround the literature he is
studying.

We believe that a language or
a literature that is different
from English cannot be studied
properly without this ex-
perience.

The aspects of language and
literature that are most im-
portant are many times aspects
which cannot be conveyed in
secondary sources. These
aspects must be drawn from
living in the proper society.

Junior Year Abroad has a lot
to offer. The JYA student is for-
ced into a situation where he
must adjust by learning a
language and by examining his
own culture.

We believe that entering a
new society can be the b: sis for
_anexcellent experience.
