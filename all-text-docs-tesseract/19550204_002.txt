Case 16, A Local
Possibility?

Perhaps ‘Case 16” was needed to dis-
turb the complacency of those who be-
lieve smugly that big-time football is com-
pletely compatible with big-time educa-
tion. True, the instance is probably an
extreme example of what happens when
athletics dominate intellect in a college
program, but the fact that there was such
a case at all points out the dangers in an
unbalanced emphasis on athletics.

“Case 16” is an unidentified Univer-
sity of Maryland football player*in his
fifth year of college work. He has an
1Q of 85 and his curriculum includes
physical education, skills courses which
are required of all freshmen, and another
course which he is taking for the third
time, having received D and F in previous
attempts.

In addition to the lowering of
academic standards, the small group of
athletes at the university receive a little
more than one-half of the total financial
aid available to students. Because of the
over-emphasis of athletics at the expense
of academic standards the university is
threatened with the loss of accreditation
unless the situation is changed quickly.

What is the significance of “Case 16”
and the Maryland crisis to Davidson?
Don’t our teams usually have scholastic
averages slightly higher than the all-
men’s average? They do—but can that
standing be maintained along with greater
emphasis on sports? It must be remem-
bered that athletic teams at Davidson now
consist of full-time students who are also
athletes, not musclemen who are in-
cidentally students of a sort.

It is no secret that scholastic require-
ments here cannot be met without some
effort, and that is one reason why we
lose outstanding prospects to other
schools. Greater subsidization does. not
seem to be the answer, because more
financial aid would be little inducement
to a boy who is afraid that he cannot
make the grades. Only a lowering of
scholastic standards would help, and
such action would compromise the in-
tegrity of the college.

Fundamentally, the question is
whether the college is to be recognized for
its intellectual or athletic program. If we
want to participate in big-time athletics on
an equal basis with other schools we must
revise our concept of the place of ath-
letics in the curriculum. Does the school
exist to produce well-educated men or
winning teams? The answer to that ques-
tion is an important one to remember
when considering the merits of subsidiza-
tion.—M.A.C.

L’Esprit des lois

As members of the Student Body, we
‘are rarely called upon to report viola-
tions of the Honor System. This is for-
tunate both for our own feelings and for
the system itself, for the system works
best when there are no violations. We are
seeking the honorable man; the cheater,
the liar, the thief, these are imperfect
products occurring where the system is
weak. We have accepted for ourselves the
responsibility of producing honor instead
of dishonor.

There are authorities such as Dr.
Frank Crane who insist that all honor
systems are invitations to dishonesty. And
perhaps they are wherever the students
fail to believe that honor is good and
that the honor system is a means of pro-
tecting and encouraging honor. The
Davidson student has always placed a high

value tag upon honor. The punishment
of violators has been only the negative
expression of this positive good present
in the everyday life of the Davidson man.

Whether discovered or not, the viola-
tor undermines the basic spirit of honor.
He abuses something not of his own crea-
tion—the opportunity for honor. He sees
that he has compromised himself, but not
that he has abused the privileges passed
on to him by previous generations of stu-
dents. The honor system is somewhat like
a bank with each class drawing on the
honor deposited by the previous classes,
and in turn making its own deposits of
honor for the future; all the while en-
joying the respect, both self and public,
which comes with trust and honor.

Our concept of honor, then, is not one
which enlists everyone as a sort of secret
police to ferret out offenders, but rather
a positive commitment of each student to
practice honor in his own daily life— al-
ways reacting quickly, however, to re-
move violators in order to protect not
only himself and the group but also the
ideal of honor. That this is tattling or
snooping is obviously false. That it re-
quires self-sacrifice and the substitution
of the welfare of the group for that of
one who has already placed his own wel-
fare above all else.is likewise obvious.

In the past we have prided ourselves
upon our honor. We must continue to do
so, justifying our pride through the exer-
cise of the responsibilities as well as the
privileges of honor.—F.F.F.

Financial Compulsion
Needed In Y Program

Compulsory Y.M.C.A. membership has
been one of the biggest considerations in
the formation of the Y Constitution which
will be presented in the near future. Dr.
Cunningham has pointed out that Y mem-
bership is not compulsory as such, for stu-
dents are not required to take an active
part in its activities. It is the financial
compulsion, however, the allotment given
the Y from every student's Activity Fee,
that most students complain about. This
financial compulsion is what the board
and cabinet have sought to alleviate in
providing for voluntary membership in
the Constitution.

It was felt that if Y membership were
made voluntary to students there would
be a less forced feeling on their part, and
consequently a ceasing of antagonism to
the Y. This would enable it to realize its
full capacities as a Christian organization
of service. The students that joined the
Y under the new system, moreover,
would probably consider themselves more
integral to the organization and would
be more active in soliciting new members
and sufficient finances to run the Y busi-
ness.

The main question, however, is fi-
nances. The Davidson College Y runs on
a budget not far short of $10,000 per
year, somewhat phenomenal for a stu-
dent body of 850. Out of the budget come
expenses for separate items running from
fifteen to well over four thousand dollars.
Services which effect all students include
the costly special services (this year the
U.C.M.) and the more costly Wildcat Hand-
book. By these two main items, and by
most of the other projects of the Y the
average student is effected.

Another primary question in studying
the proposed voluntary membership is the
question of raising the necessary money
to support the budget. If the budget is
cut, which is probable, the problem would
remain as to where the members would
go in order to solicit money to keep their
program going at its present level of ef-
ficiency and scope. Could money still
come from the college? Directly or in-
directly this would still be a drain on un-
willing students’ pockets, and the reaction
would be typical of the present wide-
spread antagonism. Could vesper of-
ferings still go to the Y? Vespers are
college-run, and it would be feasible to
question the allocating of the offering to
an organization not otherwise connected
with the college. The members could have
variety shows, skits, paper drives, or what
have you, but it is doubtful that they
could ever raise the money necessary to
meet the budget without spending so
much time on it as to make the rest of
their program ineffectual.

Regardless of their attitudes toward
it the YMCA vitally effects all students at
Davidson. Granted, a relatively small per-
centage of students are active in its work,
but in order for that important work to
continue we feel that the financial sup-
port of every student is necessary. Five
dollars is a cheap price to pay for the
services that the YMCA renders each
semester to even the most apathetic or
opposing student mind.

PREVENTION RATHER THAN CORRECTION :

“Active Duty” Is Necessary To Maintain Honor System

By CLARK REED

Article VO. “The Honor Sys-.

tem” of the Student Government
Constitution contains six sections
that deal expressly with the Honor
System. These sections state that
a student shall be honor bound to
refrain from cheating, “either on
recitations, reviews, examinations,
or any other pledge work,” from
stealing, and from perjury; and,
that any violation of these sections
that comes under the observation
of a member of the student body
must be reported immediately.
These are the sections which con-
tain the body and essence of Stu-
dent Government at Davidson.
These are the rules by which we
live with a sense of freedom and
security in this particular com-
munity.

However, it is not the Honor
System or the rules and regula-

tions that have been placed upon
the students, whether by our own
choice or by previous choice, that
makes it possible for us to take
examinations in the freedom of un-
monitered classroom, to leave
books and personal belonging in
the halls and
about the cam-
pus, to leave
during the mid-
dle of a test for
a smoke or a
drink of water,
to leave our
rooms open dur-
ing our absence
from the cam-
pus and the nu-
merous other
privileges which
we now enjoy. It is the respect
and responsibility which each in-
dividual student assumes that

makes these freedoms possible. It
is the respect for an ordered way
of living and a responsibility for
maintaining such a system that
makes these things possible. The
Honor System is no stronger than
this respect and responsibility that
each student assumes.

THE DEFENSIVE STAGE

One of the greatest dangers that
faces this student body today is
the taking of this system for
granted. It is easy to condition
one’s self to the belief that it is
not “my duty” to actively help
maintain the honor system. It is
easy to take the attitude that is a
purely defensive one in that the
student assumes that, “I think that
the system is a good one, and I

hope that we can keep it.” This:

is the most important danger of all.

Need Apparent

For Two Party

Political System In The South

By CHARLES G. HELMS

For more than three quarters of
a century our section of the United
States has been known as the Solid
South due to its unwavering, chau-
vinistic loyalty to the Democratic
Party. It is the opinion of many
people who put the welfare of their
country and their South before
party preference that this blind de-
votion is not a healthy thing.

This article is not written in sup-
port of the Republican Party;
rather, it is written in the convic-
tion that the two-party system has
been the salvation of our country,
and of course it is no less un-

healthy when there is no oppo-
sition to the Republicans in a par-
ticular state or section. There have
been instances in certain states
where an over-extended series of
Republican Administrations and a
long period of one-party voting has
resulted in corruption and inef-
ficiency, and an election of Dem-
ocratic officials was a welcome
change.

Red Reader Shoots Big Bad Wolfe

Chapel Hill, N. C.
Editor, THE DAVIDSONIAN
Davidson College
Davidson, N. C.
Dear Sir:

I just finished reading an article
in the February (Sic.) 14 issue of
The Davidsonisn, bylined by one
Mr. Willard Wolfe. Now, I do not
know Mr. Wolfe, nor if he exists,
or whether this article was some
sort of joke. However, I assume
that it was writter in good faith by
this rather misinformed gentleman
who seems to view collegiate activ-
ities as well as life with a very
jaundiced eye.

The phrase, “winning team,” and
the word, “buy,” prevail in this
article. This gentleman maintains
that in order for Davidson College
to amount to anything, she must
spend vast sums of money in order
to buy a winning team. What he is
saying in effect is that no sacrifice
is too great in order for Davidson
to have a winning football power.

He even makes the absurd state-
ment that a college cannot main-
tain good standing in the academic
world unless it boasts a winning
football] team. Mr. Wolfe makes

the statement that no player of
any ability would come to David-
son. In answer to that, if he will
investigate, he will find that one
of the senior members of the foot-
ball team was offered scholarships
to such a power as Georgia Tech.
Never have I read such asinine,
ridiculous trash written by any-
one, especially a supposedly intel-
ligent college student (I assume
from the remarks made in this
article that Mr. Wolfe is a fresh-
man).
Ce en ee ee

As an alumnus of Davidson Col-
lege, I feel no shame that David-
son possesses no great athletic
record (although the non-sub-
sidized team of 1054 had a com-
mendable record). I am proud, how-
ever, to have attended a school
which has produced a long line
of great men; a school which sees
as its primary purpose the training
of men, and npt the mass produc-
tion of All-Americans.

Someone should explain to Mr.
Wolfe just what a sense of value
is, and then see that he puts it to
use.

Yours very truly,
JOHN D. BOYETT, 'S4.

they, were not sympathetic with
States Rights, and they wanted to
raise tariffs. Now, however, the
situation has been changed and
the parties have almost reversed
their stand on the questions which
have long constituted important is-
sues in the South. Consequently,
this extratordinary fidelity to the
Democratic Party is amazing.
Another reason for the lack of
two-party support in the Southern
States is that the few Republicans
in the South, upon viewing their

‘party’s weakness in their particu-

lar state, will generally register
and vote Democratic in state elec-
tions, assuming their vote will be
wasted otherwise.

A SOLUTION

What then can be done to
remedy this deplorable situation?
First, perhaps we need an honest
reappraisal and reorganization of
our political convictions and a com-
parison of our beliefs: and ideas
with the platforms of the parties;
thus we can intelligently decide to
which fold we belong. Second, we
should never lose sight of the fact
that many times the party and its
platform is not of the foremost im-
importance, that often the candi-
date and his honesty and com-
petence should be the primary is-
sue, Third, Republicans in the
South must realize that until they
support and vote for their party’s
candidates in the state primaries
and elections, there will never be
a successful two-party system in
their state.

Let us state once more that the
purpose of this article was not to
support the Republican Party nor
to criticise the South. To the con-
trary, it was written through the
recognition of the potential value
of a two-party system in this state
and the South and the need for
college students of pre-voting age
to consider political questions in-
telligently and independently.

fensive finds it difficult to cope
with something that is new and
different. For instance, the man
who accepts the Honor System as
a good thing to have and a good
thing to maintain, yet, who fails
to take an active part in protect-
ing end improving the existing con-
ditions is not accepting the re-
sponsibilities that inevitably are
linked with freedoms whatever
kinds they may be.

In the past few years here at
Davidson we have seen several
different types of cases come be-
fore the Student Government deal-
ing with the Honor System and in-
fractions of it. When a case
reaches this state—that is when
it comes before the Council—it is
in the stage which we shall call
defensive. Everything that is con-
cerned with the case is to be pre-
sented at this time to the best
abilities of those taking part in the
investigations. This is the stage of
Student Government that most of
us see most often. Yet, this is the
stage which should be de-emphe-
sized in favor of a more important
phase which we shall call the of-
fensive stage of Student Govern-
ment.

THE OFFENSIVE STAGE

This phase is concerned with
the prevention of violations and
suspicions of violations of the
Honor System in any of its aspects.
It is to be developed by each in-
dividual student, and entails the
realization of what is contained in
the Honor System and the stress
that it can reasonably undergo. For

WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT...

INTEGRATION AND INTELLECTUALS

example, two principles are in-
volved in the Honor System in re-
gards to cheating. First of all,
each student is honor bound to re-
port any violation of this Section
that comes under his observation.

In this offensive phase of Stu-
dent Government it should be the
concern of each student to take
every precaution to insure the
safety of this section. This means
being careful what kinds of papers
and books and notes that one
brings to class during reviews, and
examinations. It means consult.
ing a professor when one is in
doubt about what is and what is
not pledged work. It means the
re-arrangement of sests if the
present arrangement hampers or
places a stress on the Honor Sys-
tem. It means being careful about
how much time is spent outside
the room during the exam and in
what manner it is spent. On the
part of each student falls the re-
sponsibility of obtaining the most
favorable conditions and the re
moval of anything that would lead
to any kind of stress on the system.
This offensive phase of Student
Government can be expanded and
this should be done actively by
every member of this Student
Body. This shifts the emphasis to
prevention rather than correction
after a violation has occurred.

There is a definite correlation
between responsibility and free
dom. Without the former, the lat-
ter is not possible. Freedom’s price
is responsibility, and it is high, but
worthwhile.

Expostulation And Reply

From the Associated Collegiate
Press have come the following edi-
torials from the Wunter Arrow,
Hunter College, New York City,
and The Emory Wheel, Emory Uni-
versity, Atlanta, Georgia. The press
conference referred to was held
in Washington, D. C., on October
21-22, 1054. Representatives of The
Davidsonien and Quips and Cranks
attended.

RSVP: We take this opportu-
nity to write an open letter to
Southern college editors.

We were profoundly impressed
by the experience of exchang-
ing ideas with you personally at
at the Associated Collegiate Press
conference in Washington recently.
We read of the intensity of feel-
ing and saw the amount of news-
paper space devoted to the sub-
ject of integration, but conversa-
tions with some of you brought
home the import of the integration
question.

Ideally, we think integration
should be carried out from the
kindergarten through university
levels. If this proves economically
and socially impossible when the
court makes its ruling, we call on
you, our fellow Fourth Estaters
from the South to campaign active-
ly for integration on the college
level as have the Emory Wheel
and the University of North Caro-
lina Daily Tar Heel.

If integration is to succeed in
future years community leaders
will have to take the initiative. As
these prospective leaders, as future
parents, teachers and administra-
tors of the South, college students
should rise above their heritage of
prejudice and work wholeheartedly
for successful integration.

As formulators of campus

opinion we call on our fellow edi-
tors to take a stand for integra-
tion on the college level, whatever
the December decision of the Su-
preme Court.

“NOUS REPONDONS: Though
the editorial (above) is not directed
specifically to The Emery Wheel,
we feel that something should be
said in answer,” the Atilenta,
Georgia, newspaper says. Its edi-
torial reply follows:

In addition to The Wheel, the
University of Texas Dally Texen
and the University of North Caro-
lina Daily Ter Heel have taken
editorial stands this year for in-
tegration at their respective uni-
versities. There may be other cases
of which we have not heard. But
of course the vast majority of the
Southern university newspapers
have not taken definite positive
stands on the integration issue.

Naturally it is easier for students
in New York or Chicago to lift a
ery for Southern integration. There
have been moves toward racial
equality in other regions, and it is
considered quite “the thing to do”
among the liberal students to raise
the banner of equalitv. But we of
the South hope and believe that
Northern students who lift such a
cry realize the imperfection of the
racial situation in their own back-
yard,

Perhaps we are mistaken, but
The Wheel feels that it speaks for
the editors of a number of South-
ern college newspapers when we
say that we see virtue in social
change, but that we do not seek to
model our society after that of the
North. The Wheel hopes that the
South can do a better job than the
North has done.

Jarrell On Intellectuals

In the January issue of Made
molselle, Randall Jarrell discusses
the current status of “The Intel-
lectual in America.” He says,
“Most of us seem to distrust in-
tellectuals as such, to feel that
they must be abnormal or else
they wouldn't be intellectuals.”

Today, “when politicians attack
or make fun of men like Dean
Acheson, they use again and again,
as one of their most effective
points against him, the fact that
he has—gone to Harvard. Can
anyone imagine their English or
French or German counterparts
being able to use Oxford, the Sor-
bonne or Heidelberg in this way?
Nor is it a question of party:
plenty of Democrats would have
done the same thing to a Repub-
lican Secretary of State.”

This attitude is not confined to
politicians, Mr. Jarrell says his
young daughter was telling him
one day about a boy whom the
other children considered odd, dif-
ferent. When he asked: “How’s he
so different?” she answered, “Lots
of ways. He—wears corduroys in-

stead of blue jeans.”

“Forgive us each day our cor
duroys,” says Mr. Jarrell.

“Intellectuals are more like plain
Americans than plain Americans
think; plenty of them ere plain
Americans,” Mr. Jarrell says, “And
if they're complicated ones, dif-
ferent, is that really so bad?”

The irony of all this, as Mr.
Jarrell points out in Mademeltselle,
is that we're all intellectuals about
something. “If you're one about
salmon-fishing, why look with re-
sentful distrust at somebody who's
one about quartets or Sanskrit?”
_ Mr. Jarrell’s thesis is that “the
man who will make us see what
we haven't seen, feel what we
haven’t felt, understand what we
haven't understood—he Is our beat
friend. And if he knows more
than we know about something,
that is an invitation to us, not an
indictment of us. And it is not an
indictment of him elther: it tales
all sorts of people to make a
world—to make, even, a United
States of American—From Meds
moiselle.
