Dear folks,

Davidsonians are re-convened once again, returned
to the hallowed haven with stories of everything from
“lost” fraternity pins to rocket launching.

During the vacation, the Davidson basketball team
once again played the role of polite host at the Carrou-
sel tournament, which, were it not for the benevolence
of Mr. John Belk, would surely be doomed.

Return to schoolwork, however, revitalized the
proteges of coach Tom Scott. Newcomer Bill Shinn, a
smooth-as-satin basketeer from the state capitol, and old-

timer Sonny Ferguson added zip to the Cat offense, and
Dave Hollingsworth continued his reliable brand of ball

as Davidson swept a road tour in Virginia.

Monday night they return to the Old Dominion to
do battle with William and Mary. At present the ’Cats are
tied with the number one team in the country for first
place in the conference!

Jayvees Split —

Ernie Wiggins’ jayvees have split even thusfar, and
some of his boys have shown flashes of promise here
and there. Most impressive of the lot has been Joe Mar-
kee, a bespectacled blond gunner from Durham.

As soon as exams are written off the books, the
charges of coach Bill Dole will begin sharpening
their fangs with eyes cast toward the ‘58 football
season. Dole is on the outlook for replacements for
six departing seniors. And Sandy Grey is looking
for a new assistant manager.

Although the interfraternity sports race has not
progressed far enough for any definite trend to be estab-
lished, it appears that an earlier prediction of a much
tighter race than in years past is in the making.

New Tennis Set-Up —

Tennis tutor Dick McKee has informed us that the,
Southern Conference tennis tournament will be run this
year in the same way that the SEC and Big Ten operate.
There will be six separate brackets—one for all the con-
ference’s No. 1 players, one for the No. 2 men, and so
on.

The tourney is slated for the William and Mary
courts on May 8, 9, and 10. McKee foresees good
prospects for Davidson’s moving back into the South-
ern Conference throne room come May.

More news from the spring sports calendar is that
Davidson will play host this season to the conference
track meet, also slated for early May.

Around the headline and deadline world of the
DAVIDSONIAN all is going well, although my boss is
still wiping away the blood from wounds inflicted by
certain campus literati in a publication we refer to as
“the poor man’s PLAYBOY.”

Love,
George

Led by “Westy” Westervelt
and Captain Dave Fagg, Da-

handily for their first win of
the year.

Westervelt, who has now
won 13 straight matches,
took his match by pinning

In the 147 pound division,
Davidson's Charlie Lampley pin-

the Wildcats’ individual vic-
tories.
Although North Carolina

Coach Charlie Parker,
who is still looking for
strength in the tighter
weight classes, will be
counting on his heavy-
weights to carry the bulk
of the load against State.
The impressive array of
Lampley, Westervelt, Fagg,
and King, the first three of
whom are undefeated this
year, should give the Wolf-
pack team 2 lot to think
about tomorrow.

There has been a great deal

of competition between Milton
Gee, Charlie Lampley and Butch
Neale for the number one spot
in the 147 and 157 weight
classes. In the lighter weights,
competition has been for the
most part between Freshmen
with Schacter, Hall, and MclIn-
tyre showing up well.

“Kappa Sigs Capture
First: Betas Take 2nd

By HENRY RAMSEY

1-F Sports Writer
After a bonecrushing Tuesday evening, the inter-
fraternity grapplers brought the wrestling tournament to
a close on Wednesday night. Each night brought out a
large crowd to see the contestants fiercely upholding
the honor of their respective fraternities and then drag
themselves off the mat with much less relish than when

they entered the scene of combat.

The unofficial standings show
that the Kappa Sigs, aided by
a lot of sweat, muscle, and meat,
took the first honors in the
tournament, earning 64 points
toward the Inter - fraternity
Sports Trophy. In second place
were the Betas with 51 points.
The K. A.s and Phi Gams tied
for third and fourth places with
46 points apiece while the Phi
Delts took fifth place honors
with 41 points.

UPSET

In the finals on Wednesday
night, the Betas’ Dave Irvin up:
set last year’s champion in the
123 pound weight class, Carrol
Pitts, K. A., by pinning him in
2 minutes and 35 seconds.

Then May of the Phi Gam

squad pinned Shipley, Sigma
Chi, in 4 minutes and 36 seconds
to take the crown in the 130
und weight class.
Another Phi Gam champion-
ship came when 137-pound Tay-
lor beat Brown, K.A., by a point
decision.

The Phi Delts’ only
championship» came when
John Poindexter, wrestling
in the 147-pound weight
class, won a decision over
Beb Hoagland, an inde

pendent.

Tenney Deane proved tis
prowess and brought more
honor to the Betas by pinning
Rumberger, a Phi Gam, in 4
minutes and seconds for the
157 pound championship.

FIRST OF THREE

The first of three Kappa Sig
came- when Bobby
Street pinned Snyder, Phi Delt,
in 1 minute and 59 seconds, tak-
ing the crown in the 167 pound
weight class, Marshal Sasser
caught up with slippery Max
Bryan, Phi Delt, and pinned
him in 1 minute and 45 seconds.
This gave the Kappa Sigs their
second victory, but then Harold
Bynum, a Kappa Sig, lost a hard
fought battle to the Beta’s
Gramely by a decision in the
191 pound weight class.

The third Kappa Sig vic-
tory, giving them their de
cisive lead in the tourne
ment, was in the heavy-
weight division. Paul Big-
gers, fulfilling the require-
ments for this division
splendidly, pinned Padgett,
a K.A,, in 2 minutes and 11
seconds,
