Off the Stump

Out of the elections grab-bag each
year come many proposals for the renova-
tion and salvation of Davidson, the com-
munity, and the world. To the seniors they
are amusing—to the juniors, vital—to the
sophomores, political and to the fresh-
men, amazing. Filtered through the
screen of practicality and promise, there
yet remain some important suggestions
for consideration and future action.

Establishment of committees
from outside of the student couneil
yet responsible to it offers many ad-
vantages with few obvious deterrents
as a definite and dynamic part of
student government. Such commit-
tees would be an arm of vitel contact
between the student body and stu-
dent government, creating interest
and leadership among many unused
corners of campus life, encouraging
thought and expression, while lesd-
ing toward an active, prominent, and
effective student government pro
‘gram. We would then have more stu-
dent government and less student
council in the total picture. There are
indeed many activities, subjects, and
projects which could be studied and
projected through such committees.
Easy to initiate, yet laden with po
tentialities, this suggestion should not
go unheeded.

Activation of the student-faculty com.
mittee, as created by the present Consti-
tution. also has its merits. As an effective
liason between student, faculty, and ad-
ministrative elements it could create mu-
tual understanding. exchange ideas cur-
rent in all corners, and work toward the
solution of collective problems. It would
present students with current situations
facing The Hill while informing admin-
istrative personne! of collegiate activity
and thought: It could thus be an entrance
into the realm of more student voice in
the affairs and actions of the, college.

The need for student awareness and
thought concerning campus problems was
stressed by each candidate in varying de-
grees. Among the solutions which seem
practical and pertinent was the proposal
for debates on topics of current and fu-
ture interest to the student body. Featur-
ing non-council participants as well as
council members this could develop into a
driving and informative force in student
affairs.

Another realm of campus life which
was approached by the candidates and
which has been dramatically highlighted
in recent days is the honor code and its
system of perpetuation. Several deficien-
cies were noted. several problems illum-
inated, and several solutions presented.
Yet none of these proposals as mentioned
promise to remove all of the obstacles or
solve the dilemmas inherently involved
in the system.

it would seem advisable, there-
fore, to form a committee of capable,
responsible, and experienced stu-
dents for the purpose of complete
evaluation of our honor system end
its operation. Such a committee
would consider the subject objective-
ly and subjectively, examining past
records and instances, corralling and
analyzing proposals for change, de-
termining student thought by confer-
ence, debate, and opinion polls, and
then preparing and presenting for
the college community 8 summary of
their actions, reports, and findings.
Of course such a summary would
necessarily include the committee's
suggested alterations and amend-
ments. Such proposals as a flexible
system of punishment and an honor
council should be carefully consid-
ered for their individual merits.

Decisions in matters of this nature and
moment cannot be made by one man, nor

by one council, nor in a brief span of
time. Evolving from study, informative
expression, and analysis they should re-
ceive full student body support before
initiation. It has been charged that few
in the student body are fully aware of
how the system works, if st works effec-
tively or why it works until forced to face
it individually. Such a charge should be
either satisfactorally answered or alle-
viated.

Also mentioned in campaign speeches
and dorm room caucuses were such pro-
posals as procurement of the Charlotte

telephone exchange, removal of Georgia -

dormitory. student representative on the
curriculum committee, freshman repre-
sentative on the Council, and revitaliza-
tion of the Court of Control. These have
been mentioned here before as well as
elsewhere, and they stand on their own
obvious merits.

The suggestion for the establishment
of a student mail service poses several
problems. Having definite negative fea-
tures it seems to have been created with-
out sufficient need or..possible benefits
for the whole student body. Added ex-
pense which would in reality by compen-
sated for by students, less service con-
veniences, inherent administrative en-
tanglements, and satisfaction with the
present system are some of the negative
considerations of this suggestion. It should
be carefully weighed by the entire stu-
dent body before any steps are taken in
this direction.

The realm of real and forceful legis-
lative activity has been traditionally re-
tarded and rather dormant. Politics in
action is a word subtly shunned in bet-
ter circles while receiving much coffee
cup condemnation. However, the drive
for more legislative control and develop-
ment, offering the benefits of practical
experience. vitalized student government,
and possible campus progress, is one
which should be shifted into high gear.

It goes without saying that the
present student council has been an
untraditionally forceful, alert, and
productive organization this year.
The progress and spirit of this year’s
student body is the rich inheritance
of President LaFar and his new ad-
ministration, its continuance and de-
velopment is his challenge.

The foregoing proposals represent a
dynamic charge to the new administra-
tion not to slide into the valley of com-
placent lethargy. but to strive forward,
building upon the solid foundations of the
present, a strong, progressive, and ex-
panded tomorrow for student government
at Davidson.

Editorially Speaking...

Commendations are in order for Mr.
Broyles of the Davidson. Printing Com-
pany, the Davidson Lions Club, and the
Student Council for their efforts in be-
half of procuring the Charlotte telephone
exchange for Davidson. Such a situation
has been idealistically sought for several
generations but has only been realistically
approached in the present year. The satis-
faction of future generations and the
gratification of alumni will be the reward
of these combined and. effective en-
deavors . . . There has been much recent
garble about the drinking rules prevalent
at D.C. Criticisms have been lobbed at the
system as being unrealistic and in need of
drastic revision. Would such critics have
college endorsed school-house parties,
bourbon on tap in the Union, or replace
the college seal with the Playboy rabbit.
It is hoped not! Then what are their pro-
posals, where are the unrealities of the
present system, what are the reasonable
complaints? Within the recent spirit and
operation of the student council many are
adequately satisfied with the present sit-
uation—a situation not determinable by
student decree in the first place. It would
behoove the capable critics to present con-
crete suggestions and needs for their at-
tacks if they are to be heard and heard
sympathetically . . .

Jim Kuist

I was talking with one of the
men on the grounds-crew about
the magazine the other day, and
he commented: “Undoubtedly your
spirit is genuine. Yet, I fear that
the product of your endeavor lacks
a significant measure of satisfac-
tion. The jokes and anecdotes and,
occasionally, a story or two rather
amuse us, but...”

I had to agree with him. The
humor of the S. & P. has been, as
long as Ive
known it. rath-
er half-baked.
The cry has
been for humor.
The _ editors,
obeying the
nebulous but
formidable cen-
sorship which
defines humor
to them, have
produced a mag
which is structurally literary,
dressed. up ‘with assorted jokes
and moderately sexy odds. and
ends with carefully contrived sub-
titles. Many times a page is quite
humorous. ,

I€ you have ever read Playboy,
you have secn a magazine designed
for the collegiate sense of humor.
If you happen to subscribe to the
Columbia Jester or the Michigan
Spartan, you receive magazines
prepared by collegiate humorists.
The two species of vehicle are
mapped towards a common desti-
nation by different routes. but
each arrives and is acelaimed.
There is no question of their

Kuist

status. They are humor magazines.

I hope that next year, The edi-
tor of S. & P. will not frustrate
themselves and their reading audi-
ences by publishing the three
funny literary magazines which
comprise our annual diet. A fourth
issue devoted to serious literature
is traditional and warrented by
the creative ability of budding
student authors. But the other
three issues must be generated
by humor itself. A college humor
magazine has this foundation: a
theme; one or two editorials to
initiate the idea; several feature
sections to spear-head the comedy;
several short stories to extend the
topic; and a quantity of jokes to
fill up the spaces. Homecoming
and Spring Frolics offer great pos-
sibilities for humor, and a third
issue might celebrate the Davidson
bachelor, as he sits, sterile and dis-
tracted, in his Belk cubby-hole.

I went down the hall to Chuck
Wright’s room a few nights ago
to see how the opposition was
coming. I found Chuck sitting in
the middle of the floor playing
with an erector set. ( A lot of guys
used to kid Chuck about his erec-
tor set, but he’s very serious about
it. Chuck, Sr., is in Construction,
and ‘young Chuck is determined
to learn the business from the
bottom up. He started out on
Tinker Toys and has been messing
around with this erector set for
the past five years.) I patted him
on the head and asked him what
he was building this time. “Bar,”
he said, without looking up. (It’s
a funny thing, but Chuck has

never made anything but bars.

He certainly has perseverance.)

BY DEPARTMENT CHAIRMEN:

Educational Analysis Proceeds

For the third successive
week, the Davidsonian is pre-
senting further  self-evalua-
tions by the Department Chair-
men. The statements that fol-
tow are the Chairmen’s an-
swers to these questions:

1. What are the changes
that have been made in your
department in the last three
years?

2. What improvements
would you like to see made in
your department in the next
few years?

3. Would you comment fur-
ther on the academic standing
of Davidson in relation to
other similar liberal arts
schools as you can see it?

DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS

Question 1. ‘None

Question 2, Expand the offering.
In Modern Physics, we would like
to have.o semester in Atomic
Physics and a semester in Nuclear
Physics.

Question 3. There .is none better
and few equals.

DEPARTMENT OF GREEK

Question 1. A revision of some
course offerings so as to provide
more work in translating Greek
authors and an ability to discuss
and understand better Greek civili-
zation in its “own” setting. There
has been an endeavor to impart
to the pre-ministerial student
especially the real possibilities of
the use of Greek in his work. Work
is now being done, by cooperation
with the faculty advisors, to. en-
courage, preministerial candidates
especially to begin their work in
Greek during the freshman year
or, in no event, later than the
sophomore year, thereby affording
them the possibility of studying
New Testament Greek before
entrance into a seminary.

Advanced courses in Greek have
been reactivated.

Question 2. I should like to
have the beginning course (Greek
11-12) operate on a five day per
week basis. Two of these periods
could be designated as laboratory
periods. This procedure would pro-
vide actually: a. great advantage
for the students by giving them
more frequent contact with the
language.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

Question 1. A. The curriculum
has been revised; and, I believe, in-
tegrated better with other depart-
ments in the College.

B. Particular effort has been
made to build up certain weak
sections of the library materials
pertaining to this department.

C. Audio-visual materials have
been purchased, for use in the
instructional program of the de-
partment.

Question 2. A. I should like to
see the above improvements con-
tinued.

B. A new approach to the pro-
fessional training of teachers needs

to be studied—an action which
has already begun. This may well
be a matter for broader study
by a committee of the Faculty.

Question 3. This type of -evalu-
ation is very difficult to make be-
cause of the variability among
such institutions; in fact, there
has been a trend in recent years
toward a decrease in accreditation
groups and lists. Academic stand-
ing is, therefore, almost entirely
a matter of personal opinion.

Thus, on the basis of the opin-
ions of other persons who know
something about liberal arts col-
leges in America, I should say
that Davidson (to the surprise of
no one) ranks very well in the
South but is well below the stand-
ing of such other colleges as Am-
herst, Haverford, Wesleyan, and
the like. I think we should seek
to take our place among the
schools generally ranked at the
top, in the opinions of persons
who should know.

DEPARTMENT OF BIBLE

Question +. cnanges—in staff
only—not in educational aim—not
in philosophy of education. We
are using a new phraseology in
the catolog but the basic offerings
and requirements are the same.

“IT just came by to see how your
campaign article’s coming along,”
I said. “Boyce gonna write it,” he
said, without looking. up. After
awhile, I hustled out to see his
roommate “Funny guy.” I thought.
“Strange he doesn't say much.
Sure is a brave little guy.” (1 don't
know whether you've noticed it
or not, but Chuck has two left
feet. It’s a handicap, but it also
gives him his chief talent: he can
make right turns quicker than any-
one else on campus.) I never did
find Boyce. so 1 have no idea what
sort of article will be published
for Chuck. Whatever it is, I ask
you to give it your serious atten-
tion. Boyce writes entertainingly.

Chuck Wright

Sitting contemplatively in the
corner of the
room, feet prop-
ped precarious-
ly on the desk's
edge, smoke
from a dangling
cigarette. float- .
ing lazily  to-
ward a cracked
ceiling — seoem- if
whether it got Wright
there or not — .
weary of writing of dull, dead
incidents, sick of being hemmed in
by convention, tradition, or rules
of the game every itinerate or
would-be writer worth his salt has
planned to write someday, some-
how, somewhere, a story. And not
just any story; but some rebellious

ing not to care

Question 2. The Dept. urgently
needs important illustrative ma-

‘terials and various visual aids,

e.g. and adequate slide and film
projector. ;

DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY

Question 1. There is no indica-
tion as to the type of change you
have ‘in mind. There have been
no changes in personnel and no
major changes in curriculum other
than the currently planned new
summer travel course in field bi-
ology. Some courses have, of ne-
cessity, to be given in much the
same way in successive years, Cer-
tain features of others are fre-
quently being juggled to arrive at
better arrangements. Equipment,
of optical and other types is steadi-
ly being improved.

Question 2. This column is per-
haps not the place for discussion
of possible future changes in cur-
ticulum. We would like to see con-
tinued improvement of equipment
and a considerably increased li-
brary appropriation. Davidson has
a long tradition (extending through
more than half a century) of pro-
ducing large numbers of prospec-
tive medical students. However,
there are other schools, no larger,

piece sketched out in his mind,
and, though he may be fired after
its printing, sued for libel, ex-
pelled from school, arrested for
slander, quite enthusiastically
horsewhipped by the parties con-
cerned, or what have you, he has
well pondered the penalty, and
thinks it not too harsh for the
playing of the game. ;

This attitude is fine in theory:
when the actual writing of this
ghostly dream story nasedly stares
one in ‘the proverbial face, then
that is a horse of a dissimilar
hue. To the somewhat different
person who attempted such a free-
dom of the press, one primary
consequence would needs be
gathered to his iron-girded loins—
meaning simply a_ sacrifice of his
sustenance.

Which statement rudely bumps
us from our mauvecolored cloud,
down, down, down to the realm of
reality. Such an attitude may be
peachy-keen on the part of the
above sacrificer or the theoretical
jargonist (God knows how many
times I have fancied the identical
dreamy dream); but we here in our
little phalanstery must keep our
heads while all around us others
are losing, theirs. For everyone
should know that all towers, ivory
or not, are surrounded by some
manner of moat. It is an old ax
that freedom of the press should
be tempered with ciscretion.

But must our discretion be tem-
pered with discretion?

I shall never forget the first
time that I met Jim Kuist. It bap-
pened about a month after the
opening of school my freshman
year. I was strolling along the old

that contribute six to twelve times
as many biologists to regular grad-
uate schools. By a slight shift in
emphasis Davidson could not only
perform its pre-medical functions
as well as ever but could also make

golf course, immersed in various
thoughts, when, cresting a small
rise, I stumbled upon an extra.
ordinary sight, or so I thought at
the time—now I know better.
There, sitting on the ground,
backed up against a lone pine, was
Jim: a haunting nocturne drifted
from the violin he fondled; a
divine soprano voice _ liltingly
launched that nostalgic old air,
“La Pastorella’: beside him re-
clined an odd-shaped bottle whose
pervasive aroma was surely dis.
tilled from the mists of the wild,
heatherbound moors of Scotland;
and with an orangecolored moon
reflecting from his hornrims, it
became a rather startling scene
for a grassgreen freshman. I eeked
out a timid, “Hi.”

He spun around and quizzed,
“How are you fixed for blades.”

As the years have sped by.
Jim and I have become fast
friends. I have gotten to know the
real Jim, the Jim personified in
the idiosyncrasies which bubble
up within him: the niche his
carved wooden idol plays in his
seclusive life; his engaging habit
of taking money from the collec.
tion plate as it passes him in Ves.
pers; the copying of all of his
short stories and research papers
from French publications (who is
then to be the wiser?); his Har-
monization with the faculty.

If any of you readers (I trust
there are some) haven't met Jim,
you should. He is really a nice
fellow. He can usually be found
in 120 Belk or the cut office—
Yes, he is the one who initials
the small ‘yellow cards that begin,
“According to our records. . .”

‘SHALLOW

IDEALISM’

DEATH OF ORDERLY INTEGRATION

By JOHN DYKERS

There seem to be a great many
people in America today who claim
the status of magnanimous Chris-
tian or herald of the future, and
as such, lead the glorious fight for
integration of the white and
colored peoples.

These people are, perhaps un-
wittingly, defeating their own pro-
pounded purpose. They have made
the grave mis-
take of making
the ideal their
immediate goal
instead of their
guiding princi-
pal, and in do-
ing so they ,
have often sac-
their

rificed

principles and

defeated their

ends. These Dykers

people I call the shallow idealists.

You will find shallow idealists
in all walks of life, in every worth-
while endeavor, and in every
struggle for improvement. They
will often do the loudest condemn-
ing, the least good, and the most
harm of all those connected .with
a particular undertaking. It is very
sad to see a significant contri-
bution made or step taken at great
sacrifice of time and effort, and

then watch it be destroyed by a
foolish extremist,

The man who abandons and
returns to his guiding princi-
ples whenever it.seems con-
venient may be either unsure
of his prinicipals, in which
case he should not claim them
without further examination,
or he may be merely a vile
opportunist.

Many of the exponents of inte-
gration have rung forth the cry
of brotherhood and consideration
for one’s fellow man in an appeal
to admit colored people to white
institutions, but so very often
when it came to the particular ap-
plication of the principle, it was
abandoned in an irrational dash
past the limits of propriety and a
reasonable hope.

Along this line, let us also con-
sider the discrimination inherent
in making a big hullabaloo over
someone because of the color of
his skin, or in granting special
privileges for the same reason,
e. g. a special scholarship for a
colored student. It is discrimina-
tory injustice to include or ex-
clude someone solely on the basis
of the color of his skin, black or
white, and I accuse the shallow
idealists of such discrimination.

There are a great many people

in the South today who work, care-
fully, quietly, dilligently, and suc-
cessfully for improvement of the
relations between races and for
the welfare of the colored people
in particular. I'm speaking now
of people born and raised in the
South and who expect to live and
die here, not “carpetbaggers” or
“outsiders”, but white Southern-
ers, and colored Southerners.

These people, and they ere
often influential and powerful
leaders, have @ genuine re-
spect for the needs and wishes
of each other, end an intimate
knowledge of their own posi-
tion. With this group rests the
hope for peaceful integration.

And the shallow idealists are
rapidly exterminating them. The
“moderate” position is becoming
more and more difficult to hold.
Several explanations are offered
for this result. William Faulkner
attributes it to the tendency to
side with the underdog, which
the colored man has been and the
white Southerner has become. The
balance of legal power has shifted
sides, and against it have shifted
the men who worked hard for
the underprivileged colored people
and who now will labor for the
preservation of the social system
threatened with forced destruc-

tion. I would like to add some
other factors.

First, is the natural reaction
to being pushed too far and too
fast. Another is fear of the un-
known, and racial equality in the
South is certainly that, for most
people. A third is loss of the
control which bred magnaminity.
And perhaps most important of
all is the law of action and reac-
tion; a radical extremist action by
one party results in a radical ex-
tremist reaction by the other. The
attitude becomes one of “Either
you’re for me or agin me.”

The lines are drawn, black
and white, and the choice of
side is forced and irrevocable
and total. Alignment results
in Alienation. The middle
ground becomes a no-man’s
land, and moderation and com-
promise are no longer possi-
ble. The answer rests with
power, and neither side can
afford to give an inch. Again
§ eccuse the shallow idealists
of such action, and of pre-
cipating such a situation, and
be it ignorant enthusissm or
egotistical flag-waving, it is
self-defeating and harmful to
the South, the Nation and
menkind. ...
