Party Pledge: More Harm Than Good

When the difficult question of
after-dance parties is brought up
Dean Bailey is often a difficult, man
to pin down, but there is one point
on which he is unequivocal: the aft-
er-dance pledge required of fraternity
officers, as it now stands, should be
abolished. We heartily agree.

The pledge required is:

| attended the party described
above during the hours indicated be-
low. To the best of my knowledge and
beliof, the party was conducted in a
manner acceptable to the standards
of gentlemanly conduct, and there was
no profane or abusive language, inde-
cent dress or gestures, conduct unbe-
coming a lady’s escort, or any other
similarly gross ungentlemanly conduct
on tho part of the students present.
There was no time during the party
when at least one of the undersigned
was not in attendance.

My fraternity and # understand
that the signing of this statement in
no way abrogates the faculty rule,
which states: “A student will ordi-
narily be suspended if he is found
guilty of drinking, possessing or being
under the influence of an alcoholic
beverage while within the town limits
of Davidson or while attending any
off-campus event sponsored entirely or
in part by Davidson College.”

In the three years since Dean
Bailey consented to return to his job
as Dean of Students he has requested
that the’rule be abolished. When he
moved back into his office he ex-
pressed the opinion that he did not
like the pledge and did not want to
administer it. ‘

Dean Bailey feels that the pledge
is inconsistent with the overall policy
of the College. Again we agree.

While our position coincides with
Dean Bailey’s. we have arrived there

by a different line of thought.

Our position is that the pledge
places an unfair pressure on the in-
dividual fraternity officers. In some
cases they are forced to ‘look: the
other way”, in others they must com-
promise their personal standards.

It is our conviction that the pledge
in no way tempers after-dance par-
ties, It is unknown by many and ig-
norcd by others.

This is not to say that all after-
dance parties are in violation of the
pledge. Indeed, we who have attend-
ed these parties for the past four
years consider them more acceptable
now than in the past. But in no way
is this due to the pledge.

Fraternity members realize the
uncertain statis of after-dance parties
and are doing their best to keep the
privilege of administering their own
social functions. A certain maturity is
reflected in this.

If the faculty imposes this pledge
on fraternities with the intention of
alleviating after-dance problems we
fear that their good intentions mere-
ly place fraternity: officers in an un-
pleasant position.

We respect the faculty's inten-
tions; we question their methods.

The DAVIDSONIAN offers. no

panacea for this problem. We do be-
lieve the pledge is worse than no con-

trol at all: both because it seems to
sanetion afler-dance activities which
are contrary to general school policy,
and because it creates in itself an evil.

This is a problem which lends it-
self to Student Council consideration.
We hope that the Council will answer
to the challenge presented—with
more than discussion groups.

For The YMCA: New Status

Whether it was their avowed in-
tention we're not sure, but the YMCA,
by its successful sponsorship ‘of the
Book-of-the-Semester Program has
raised its campus status a bit.

_ Programs with more potential have
died in the past. Last year many
thought that a program whose suc-
cess depended on the voluntary read-
ing of a book by a large number of
the student body was doomed. The
interest and participation of students
this week proved the scoffers wrong
indeed.

. Where lies’credit for the success
of a program that was supposed nev-
er to get off the ground? Mainly in
the work of an organization man.
Tommy Colvin, and his committee.

, When before have we been de-
luged with such frequent allusions,

announcements, posters and even re-
minders from the sky of cultural op-
portunities? All of this is new to pres-
ent-day Davidsonians. All of this has
proved effective.

The secret of this project is old-
fashioned hard work, for which there
is no substitute. Tommy has worked
against some substantial handicaps.
One was a negative student attitude.
Another which. affected the Wednes-
dav night attendance to hear Mr.
Packard was a heavy schedule of re-
views this week although the Book-
of-the-Semester Committee had asked
the faculty for cooperation along this
line.

What the final results of the Book-
of-the-Semester will be is at this time
uncertain. We hope that the Y will
continue it under equally enthusiastic
leadership as that given by Colvin.

Telephone Romeos Must Go

It seems that as pleasant an in-
novation as the free telephone line to
Charlotte can’t be made available to
students without a fe w feeling
obliged to take advantage of the sys-
tem. Certainly cooperation should be
the watchword in the use of college
telephones. We are speaking § spe-
cifically to those who avail themselves
of this privilege to the inconvenience
of others.

Most calls placed to girls’ schools
must be completed before the regula-
tions of that school—and they are
often absurdly early — interfere.
Dance weekend dates are often de-
pendent on telephone calls that are
never completed because of the in-
considerate actions of a few.

The worst offenders are those who
feel the need to talk on and on to
Queens or Charlotte because the line
is now free. They ignore the requests
of their schoolmates to give others

a chance, at least, at the phone.

Those monopolizing phone booths
often suggest that those waiting go to
other floors. The others are always
just as full. Inconsideration is not
limited to one dorm or one offender.

We feel that five minutes is not
an unreasonable limit to place on a
call. Anything beyond that approach-
es the high school conversations
which we should now have outgrown,
and which result in nothing more
than idle small-talk.

As a rule violence isn’t a cure for
any evil. However, when a call for
a date can’t be completed because of
someone's gabbing on ad infinitum
the circumstances become downright
extenuating and we're in favor of
whatever methods are necessary to
drag him from the booth after a rea-
sonable amount of time.

In. this case. a little consideration
of others would: go a long way.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

by Ackerman [From vu. VA. “CAVALIER”

Ackerman —

Letters Score Bias, Baggst?-Trap
And ‘Backdrop Questions’ At D.C.

Larry Smith

Dear Editor:

In reference to Mr. Arm-
field's now well-known “lines
on the African Problem”, I
should really like to know just
what these lofty ideals of the
Southland for Southerners con-
sist of.

For a moment there |
thought you meant Dr. Polley
was attacking in his “allte-
gory” some basic values we
all and you all believe in or
endorse—such as capitalism,
democracy, or Christianity.
Then | realized that these
were not the issues at all—
surely not those defended
and even more certainly not
those attacked.

What Mr: Armfield was de-
fending has nothing to do with
anything so universal or so de-
cent. Actually these ideals of
the South. when viewed from
a detached position, plummet
to the bigoted prattlings of a
prejudiced race, desperately at-.
tempting to defend the inde-
fensible — ridiculously enough
on the intellectual plain.

| cringe to think that any
intelligent person could so-
rationalize his ethics as to
rally for the causes of hate,
injustices, and the immorali-
ty of caste—and do so with
smugness and devotion to e
self-assured sense of duty.

Perhaps in some imaginably
far off point in time an un-
biased “outsider” can express
his views on the issues without
being whispered away as “one
of those damn Yankees who
really can't imagine the real
problem we all have down
here.”

All the while the Church in
pious whimperings mills around
sighing “Someday .. . some-
day ... love one another...
and will -those in the back
‘please lock the doors behind
you?" I would personally like
to sec the South adopt a new
battle hymn of the republic,
if not a new republic altogeth-
er!

While on the subject of
smait matters, ' would like
also to remind assistant Dean
White that the dedicated of-
forts of his department te
keep out “offsenive, effemin-
ate’ boys from Davidson
who wouldn't “fit-in’, have
been rather ineffectual
random remarks being any
Proper judgment.

Indeed such types have per-
meated the fraternity brother-
hoods, student government po-
sitions. all campus activities,
the faculty, and perhaps even
the Admissions Office.

As to the feeling that such
a person wouldn't fit in here,
I am very surprised to see Mr.
White expressing so little ¢on-
fidence in the Davidson motd.
But after all you cah't gpt
blood out of a turnip.; ‘

Larry Baggett

Dear Editor:
I don't know if many of the
readers of the DAVIDSONIAN

are familiar with the “Baggett
Trap.” Well, I, Bagget, was not
familiar with it by this name
until a few days ago. I was
very much aware of its exist-
ence but. thought that its true
handle was “That Damn
Thing.”

There is a sort of walk-
way between the fraternity
houses across which runs a
creek. The “Baggett Trap”
lies at this intersection. Now
1 do not mantain that | am
outstanding as an indepen-
dent blind man. As a matter
of fact, | am not. It is only
with the greatest strategy
and precision maneuvering
that | can make the trip solo.
I do-not ask your pity for

me, but I do have some feelings
for the girls who will be on
this campus next week. Doubt-
less it will rain and naturally
the “Trap” will be set.
course, last year the college
was so kind as to put up some
wooden planks across the more
swampy sections.

However, this is not the
answer because | know of
one man’s biind date that
caught a high-heel in those
boards and broke all four of
her legs.

Now ‘personally 1 like con-
ergte or at least something
more solid than the grave! we
havé now or the “temporary
surface” we may get for home-
coming. .

1 think it's high time a fel-
low’s cane should go “click”
instead of “sqush.”

David Robinson

Dear Editor:

On the stage far below but
slightly in front of the massive
backdrop of an expanding’ phy-

‘sical plant at Davidson there

were playing last week a sev-
eral tragi-comic dramas. In the
midst of successes in the realm
of finance it was ‘guite easy to
forget the lessSgfecesstul ef-
forts in other areas of liberal
arts education; however,
don’t forget forever.

we

t personally feel that the
areas in which Davidson has
made lesser achievements
ments are the areas most im-
portant in liberal arts educa-
tion, and that it is the re-
sponsibility of both the DA-
VIDSONIAN and each of us
individually to direct our at-
tention to these realms, rath-
er than to backdrop ques-
tions of physical plant or off-
stage questions of the details
and statistics of our admis-
sions policy. :

Each of us has his personal
estimate of what the real issues
are. I have already expressed
my bias, but permit me to
make it a little more specific,

of .

in terms of what, td me, are
a couple of the greatest prob-
lems and unmet needs of Da-
vidson College.

The question of intelfectual
stimuation, as | see it, should
be the object of our greatest
concern. When |? think of the
intellectual conformity im-
posed each year upon a tre-
tmendously promising fresh-
man class by upper class at -
titudes, when JI sense the
stifling of the initiative and
creative activity of some pro-
fessors, when ft note the over-
cautious and begrudging at-
mosphere accompanying what
reforms are obtained, and
when 1! see that Davidson may
be losing, in the near future,
professors who have served
as its greatest stimulants, |
begin to question the quality
of our intellectual life here,
is an_ intellectual purpose
central at Davidson?

To me the second issue which
demands our concern is the
isolation of the various individ-
uals of the Davidson communi
ty from the persons most vital-
ly opposite to themselves.

When ! think of the bam-
boo curtain between fraterni-.
ty men and = independents,
when ! sense the artificial
relationship between many
members of the faculty and
many students, when | note
how deep is the tine of social
demarcation made by the Da-
vidson railroad track, or
when J read about the trustea
policy on the admission of

a Negro student, | begin to

question the willingness of

individuals et Davidson to en-
ter into learning situations
with pérsons of varying
temperament and background.

Are our extra-curricular ac-
tivities and contacts challeng-
ing and strengthening our pur-
poses and contributing to a
search for truth?

It is my personal hope that

we students and the DAVID-.:

SONIAN will direct some of
our best energies to the com-
munity issues which we think
most urgent, not with foregone
conclusions but with a dedica-
tion to discovering and acting
upon the truth.

Are You Really Liberal? |
Check Yourself Here...

Editor’s Note: The article which appears here was
submitted to the University of Virginia CAVALIER
DAILY and printed therein last week. Believing It to be
of interest. to Davidson students, whatever their opin-
ions, the DAVIDSONIAN here reproduces the article in
its entirety.

You are untrue to the real Liberal spirit unless you

adhere to the following tenets: ,

1. You must believe that the individual is not re-
sponsible for his actions, but that “society” (other peo-
ple) must be held accountable; that he must be rescued
by big Government from the results of sloth, indolence,
improvidence. poor judgment, as well as misfortune.
The poor must be given money to curse the “symptom
of their poverty, rather than be shown how to be self-
sustaining, and have their pride and self-respect re-
stored. Encourage them to remain on the dole.

FOR GOVERNMENT

2. You must reverse the time honored concept of
big Government as tending to be corrupt with power,
and tyrannical. You must believe that somehow poli-
ticians in 1958 have repealed human nature, and our
fates and lives can safely be placed in their hands; that
they are endowed with superior wisdom concerning
spending our tax money; that they (the Government) has
money of their own somehow, and are not simply giving
us back our tax money in services less a terrific slice for
brokerage. You must vote for government dams etc.
with attendant waste inefficiency etc., vs. private.

3. You must believe that it is right and proper to
take from one and give to another, while the politician
is enabled to be re-elected by this process.

FOREIGN AID

4. You must be for “foreign aid” and help build up
andother 200 or 300 million Chinese, Africans et al., to
“aid” by helping in medical services. Especially must
you believe in “aid” to socialist governments, to keep
them going, and to those either against us outright such
as Yugoslavia and Poland, or those leaning against us
such as Indonesia and India.

5. You must hold it as a religion that all religious -
and patriotic organizations are bad, and that all of
the “front” organizations are good; you must welcome
Paul Robeson, Alger Hiss and Owen Lattimore as speak-
ers, but reject as “controversial” those who are out-
spoken Anti Communists and conservatives.

DEBT UNIMPORTANT
6. You must believe that while it is all;right, for a
family or a business to live within its means, it is not
at all important. for a Government to do so (ala Keynes);
that debt is simply something ‘we owe ourselves”. It
depends, of course, upon who the “we” and “ourselves”
are.

7. You must believe in the conformity of “non-con-
formity” and follow the majority in absolutely identical
views on everything under the sun, but at the same
time you must designate those opposed to this ritualistic
Liberalism as ‘“‘conformists’, and ‘“McCarfhyites”’. You
must hold with those who vow that “academic freedom”
is a one way street, meaning freedom to express radical

or even subversive views, but not “controversial” ortho-
dox ones. You must believe that all dissidents are sub-

jects for “mental health” review and possible intern-
ment in some mental hospital. You must be a non-con-
formist in regard to religion, morality, patriotism, and
the eternal verities, (regarding them as “relative”) but
when it comes to the cliches and shibboleths of the cur-
rent ritualistic “Liberalism” fad, you must be a com-

plete conformist. (And no nonsense about “relativism”
concerning this latter either).

POWER OF LABOR

8. You must believe that the all powerful labor
unions are “good” and that all business is bad; that la-
bor unions.should have no checks whatever, but should
have the power of life and death over its members; that
they have a perfect right to exercise violence, bomb
the homes, threaten and injure the families and beat up
thosc members who wish to work. Boys will be boys and
this should be dismissed as just harmless excess zeal.

9 You must believe in subsidies to all big voting:
groups, such as Farmers (7 billion), in order to prop
up prices to the consumer, create surpluses to store,
etc.; you must believe in rent ceilings in order that no
one will wish to risk building, and shortages may be
created.

CATER TO ALL

10. You must cater to all “minority” groups (except
Indians who do not have many votes), you must frown
on newspapers mentioning the nationality or color of
a criminal, or comedians telling a dialect joke or color-
ing his face, and general conform to the prevailing style,
instead of being a non-conformist.

If you fail in so much as one of the above, you will
be castigated as being “reactionary”, “Republican”,
Fascist, Racist, that you wish people to starve, that you
had to be “dragged into the 20th century”, etc., etc.,
ad nauseum.

You must believe in progressive education, that the
“Liberals” have repealed the law of compensation, that
the law of atrophy of muscles and mind not used fosters
class hatred, that the politicians (if liberal) have been
cleansed of all envy and hatred of those who excel, and
that their judgment in spending your money is infallible.
