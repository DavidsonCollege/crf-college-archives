THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, MAY 2, 1958

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

A President, A Four-Leaf Clover

A good man must be hard to find.
That was about all we could gather
from Mr. LaFar's answers to ques-
tions concerning the prospects that
Davidson will have a President by
May 15. (see page one) |

_ It is understandable that the nomi-
nation committee of the Trustees take
time in making such an important de-
cision as the selection of a new Pres-
ident for the College, but it is equally
understandable that a college needs
a president.

It would be a mistake for the
Trustees to allow the College to enter
a second presidentless year. This
year’s administration leadership has
been good, under the circumstances,
all that could be desired. However,
they have wisely refrained from mak-
ing any policy decisions. feeling that
a new President should set his own
policy.

As the year has gone by these
questions have multiplied until it has
recently become clear that if the Col-
lege is to continue on an even Keel,

some new policies must be formulat-
ed.

In short, the best time for select-
ing a new President is right now. Un-
derstanding the difficulties, we urge
the nominating committee to exert
every possible effort in finding a
qualified nominee by May 15.

The DAVIDSONIAN would furth-
er suggest that a suitable man for
the job is already available here at
Davidson, a man whose personal
ability has been demonstrated by his
continuous service as a member of
the administration for over six. years,
who has further shown his sense of
responsibility and initiative by. play-
ing a large part in the continued pro-
gress at Davidson during the interim

‘period since Dr. Cunningham's resig-

nation, and whose personality and in-
terest in the student body are well
known to all of us.

Perhaps the committee could find
the proverbial four leaf clover right
here in the campus grass.

Productive
Scholars Needed

Creative scholarship has long
been missing on the Davidson scene.
Professors complain, with some justi-
fication, that heavy teaching sehed-
ules, committee meetings, and other
commitments leave no time for re-
search, book writing, and the like.

Professor W. P. Cumming has
proved, at least, that it can be done.
This year he has published two books
and has been awarded a coveted Gug-
genheim Fellowship to continue his
research next year in Europe.

The DAVIDSONIAN  congratu-
lates Dr. Cumming on his achieve-
-ments and suggests that they serve as
both an example and encouragement
to other members of the faculty.

It is the considered opinion of the
majority of educators that good teach-
ing and productive scholarship go
hand in hand. The real benefactors
of work such. as that of Dr. Cumming
and of other research being carried
on by members of the faculty are the
members of the Student Body.

The Menu: |
International Pie

Due to the generosity of a family
long related and long devoted to Da-
vidson College, this institution will
next year jump into a large scale
scholarship program for foreign stu-
dents.

The Richardson Fund will enable
Davidson to bring to this campus out-
Standing foreign students for one
year of study, and in addition will
provide these foreigners a certain
amount. for summer travel.

The potential of this program is
virtually* untimited. Those who have.
had the opportunity to associate with
those exchange students currently on
campus will testify to the fact that
in almost every case the values re-
ceived from this association are un-
paralleled in any other phase of cam-
pus life. Not only are those from
abroad given a chance to taste the
American college life, but they bring
to the college a bit of international

flavor that in this era of the shrinking
globe can lead to highly valuable
ends.

Arguments that we should look
homeward before reaching abroad
are challenged by the twofold bene-
fits reaped under this program.
Foreigners fortunate enough to study
here have time and again taken home
bright, encouraging pictures of Amer-
ica, gleaned in the main from Da-
vidson College. And, secondly, the ex-
periences and yiews brought in by
these exchange students certainly add
to broaden the outlook of the ‘“cos-
mopolitan” Davidson gentleman.

Several fraternities are at present
providing meals and fellowship for
foreign students. With the increased

influx next year, the fraternities will
have the opportunity to take more

‘under their wing. The administration

hopes to place all of these newcomers
with fraternities, but will in no means
force the issue. This is a project which
can provide an invaluable asset to the
college, to the fraternities, and to the
individual. The DAVIDSONIAN heart-
ily urges all fraternities to consider
helping themselves to a -piece of the
international pie.—G.W.R.

A Case For

Compromise

Thursday’s chapel talk on the es-
sentials of leadership by Professor
Joel Conarroe was a refreshing -e-
minder that it is possible to listen to
something truly worthwhile between
thé hours of ten and eleven on Tues-
day. Phursday, and Friday mornings.

We, however, take issue with Mr.
Conarroe on one point. He held
strongly that there is no room for
zompromise in the policy of an ideal
leader.

The American system of govern-
ment is built upon the hypothesis
that all interest groups must give a
little so that it will be possible for
them to live side by side in a demo-
cratic community. Without compro-
mise, the noble experiment which is
democracy would surely fail.

The genius of great leadership
lies in knowing when, where, and
what not to compromise.

The first problem which
faced the ‘57-58 IFC was fi-
nances in general and dance
costs in particular. The Council
decided to try to finance the
three dances at a cost of be-
tween $18 and $20 per mem-
ber. By sign-
ing less ex-
pensive or-
chestras and

DURING THE PAST YEAR

IFC Did Much, Leaves Much To Be Done

$22.40 to $18 despite the fact
the IFC was in debt when the
council took over. The new
council has a comfortable sum
with which to begin their work.

Rush Week, operated on the
inadequate rules used in the
past, saw dubiously close ap-
proaches to “dirty rushing.”
The new regulations call for
rush week to begin one week
earlier and for all confirmation
to be handled by the IFC alone.

In the way of service pro-
jects, the IFC again sponsored
the annual Christmas Party for
the Barium Springs Orphanage.
Also, as in the past, the IFC co-
sponsored the blood drives with

the ROTC Department.

New ventures in the nature
of service included leading the
United Appeal campaign on the
campus and encouraging a large
number of students to begin
polio shots with the Salk vac-
cine. In addition, the IFC co-
operated with the administra-
tion in holding the college's
first Pre-Freshman Weekend.

Hell Week, which had been
modified from an eleven to a
four day period, got off to a
sensational start with Skit Nite.
The vigorous faculty reaction
disrupted planned programs
which became generally disor-
ganized. In recent action, the

Writer Likes Shearer Hall

Keep Old Building

Dear Sir:

I resent Mr. Blake’s article
in last week's D. denouncing
and defaming Shearer Hall.
That old building has been my
home for the past three years
and (although it has no hot
water or shower) I have come
to appreciate it-and love it. It
will be a very sad-day when
I hear that it is going to be
pulled down, especially if it
will be replaced by another one
of those pseudo-anything eclec-
tic structures which have been
going up around here since the
Guest House.

My room in old Shearer looks
out on some of the best and
worst examples of architecture
in Mecklenburg county. The
Literary Society buildings de-
signed ‘by John Mills over a
century ago represent a fine

tradition . . . they are archi-
tecturally honest. Dishonest,
however, is the church, whose
huge, ugly, brown columns
hold up nothing, surmounted
by an awkward, badly propor-
tioned spire...

With all the sertous, intel-
lectually fair’ architects in the
country, I hope Davidson will
be fortunate enough to get a
Fine Arts building in a decent
twentieth century tradition.

P. Faggart

From India

Dear Editor:

While living in India this
year, I have been struck by the
interest of Indians and other
Asians in America’s race, prob-
Jem. Indeed the whole world
murmurs at each bit of inter-
racial news from the States.
But the U. S. A. is not the on-

ly country with strained inter-
personal relations. Every coun-
try has them: India in the form
of caste, South Africa in the
form of inter-racial relations
far more sub-Christian than
those in America (vide “Naught
For Your Comfort,” T. Hud-
dleston) ...

Christians with the message
of Reconciliation (II Corinthians
5:16-21) and Unity (John 17:20-
23) have a duty—a duty first
to act in every daily relation-
ship through love; secondly, to
study all areas of tension;
thirdly, to pray that we might
be used in increasingly larger
ways to fulfill our ministry of
Reconciliation and Unity. Not
only the judgment of the
world but the judgment of God
must necessarily be upon our
attempt at fulfilling our mis-
sion.

THE ICONOCLAST

IFC, following rulings of the
national offices of all chapters
represented, removed Hell
Week in favor of a more con-
structive and instructive Greek
Week program. For this week
$180 from Hell Week fines was
appropriated to be used as seen
fit by the new IFC.

In following up action initi-
ated by the previous IFC, tho
council worked with the ad-
ministration in laying plans for
the new fraternity court. As a
result of fraternity votes, the
court has single units with rent
to be paid on an equal basis
by each fraternity member. Al-
so the fraternity system has
seen the development and ad-
dition of its new member, Sig-
ma Nu, on an equal competitive
basis.

Particular attention was paid
this year to faculty-student re-
lations. In following this up,
the IFC met on three occasions
with the Faculty Fraternity
Committee to discuss common
problems, In addition to par-
ticulars, a spirit of good-will and
cooperation was maintained and
a foundation for further mutual
cooperation was laid.

The IFC endeavored to ac-
complish much this year. How-
ever, in addition to continuing
policies now initiated, the chal-

lenge for new IFC action is.

great:

(1) Preferential bidding.
While this year’s council did
not push this matter, the idea
was presented and attention
was drawn to the possibility of
a new pledging and limiting
system. This coming year the
subject should be more
thoroughly investigated and
presented. Preferential bidding
could be the most beneficial

addition to Davidson’s fraternj.
ty system. .

(2) Greek Week. The IFC wil)
be called upon to plan and ear.
ry through a constructive Greek
Week program. This will. need
imaginative planning and should
be an important contribution to
valuable fraternity activity.

(3) Rush Week. Much work
and, time will be required to
insure the new Rush Week
regulations. The succéss of the

revised week will depend great:

ly on the IFC's leadership.

(4) NIC. Next year, with the
National Interfraternity Confer.
ence meeting in Atlanta, David.
son’s IFC has the opportunity of
enlarging its scope and more
actively entering national fro.
ternity affairs. This area has
long been neglected by IFC's at
Davidson.

(5) Constitution. The present
IFC constitution is over a dec-
ade old and does not adequately
cover the expanded activity of
the fraternity system. A com.
plete revision is in order.

The need for evaluation of .

the purpose and nature of the
fraternity system is continual.

Also, the door is wide open for‘

energetic leadership in the area
of campus and community ser.
vice projects.

It was the operating principle
of the Interfraternity Council
this year that under student ini-
tiative Davidson’s fraternity
system could be one of its most
valuable assets. Constructive ac-
tion has been undertaken and
the importance of responsible
fraternity activity has been em.
phasized. A continued and sus-
tained effort will be necessary
if the fraternity system is to
be the credit to the college it
is capable of being.

I'm Such a Pig’

By TENNY DEANE

With coming of the month of May also comes the
anticipation of attending the annual May Day festivities
at one of the surrounding girl’s schools. However, every
year the same old story is told by some and this year is no
exception. The girl that you thought you had snowed

on the last dance weekend just forgot to mention that ©

her school was even having a May Day. In fact, when you
asked her for a date for this weekend she casually re-
plied that she had made other plans. Is this a subtle hint?

Smitty Smith has just arrived back on campus after
a vacation of several days in Presbyterian Hospital. A
very reliable source has informed me that as soon as he
walked into the hospital a cute student nurse saw him
and called, ‘Hi, Smitty!” Who was it, a girl from home?

Last Saturday I was invited to a called meeting of
the Fine Films Club and was told that I had misinformed —

the public of the club’s recent activities. I regret making
this mistake and submit my humble apology.

The ROTC motto—‘Rain, rain go away, come again
on Tuesday” has been run into the ground lately. It has
not only rained on Tuesday but on every other day as
well. It cain’t rain forever, can it?

Situations invariably arise on dance weekends that
aren't always revealed immediately after they happen.
This story comes out of the last dance weekend:

A certain Davidson gentleman had the extreme mis-
fortune of having a blind date. As the weekend progressed
it became very obvious that they weren’t having a good
time. Finally at the dance on Saturday night as they were
seated in silence at one of the tables in his fraternity
section, his date turned her head toward him and un-
pectedly apologized, ‘I’m sorry that I’m such a pig!”

"Gone Is The Hunter, Gone From The Hill”

By BRUCE VAN SANT

it has been interesting, if
not amusing, to note the reac-
tion of the inadequate system
in regulation of student con-
duct in recent weeks. The hunt-
er had miscalled a few of his
shots, and now the sportive
bird dogs are of a more serious
turn, eager, to make a show of
their efficiency lest they be
dispensed with altogether. What
is most amusing is to watch
them cast about for prey in
church itself, hopefully wait-
ing for an outbreak of chortles

vey from the
balcony.

it is beyond question that Da-

its purpose of education if the
administration were more con-
cerned in marking up their
blackboards than their  stu-
dents.

There exists o state of war
between the good masters of
Davidson and certain Victorian
‘taboos; to wage such a war and
maintain a wide theatre of cam-
paign one must draw extensive-
ly upon the resources at hand.
Davidson is constructed to dis-
pense knowledge and culture,
which resources are certainly

the cause of Victorianism.

to drive the impartial student
