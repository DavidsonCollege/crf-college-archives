Fraternities (cont)

(Continued from page one)
of fraternities.

We are disturbed that Davidson
College officially condones a system
of exclusiveness when that exclusive-
ness evolves from actions directly
contrary to the most fundamental
principles of the college.

Under no circumstances could we
justify the existence of such a system
at Davidson so long as the college
professes the lofty goals contained’ in
its “Statement of Purpose.” Perhaps
our concern would be somewhat less-
ened were it not for the overpowering
influence of the fraternity system on
Davidson student life, and, conse-
quently, on Davidson College itself.

But the impact of the system is not
slight. To the contrary, it is monu-
mental both for the member and for
the non-member.

Most noticeable, of course, is the
‘force of the fraternity system on the
non-member who desires to be a part
of that group which includes three
out of every four Davidson students.
The bitterness of “rejection” is strong
and heart-breaking. Moreover, this
bitterness has caused many students
to leave Davidson im pursuit of a
more adequate social life.

Less frequently mentioned, but
more important if for no reason other
than the fact that it involves more
people, is the effect of the fraternity
on its members.

The freshman—if he wishes to
“succeed” in rush—quickly learns
what is expected of him. If he cares
and learns quickly enough, he will
probably get the bid he wants. And
once inside the fraternity, the pledge
continues to play the proper role in
anticipation of initiation. °

In_ essence, he learns aot the

up expects and responds accord-
fugly if he wishes to become a part
of. that all-important group. At times
the group expresses itself subtly; at
other times the group is quite blunt.

There is no choice. Belong and con-
form. Or resign yourself to social
doom by depledging.

Delayed rush would attack the
Symptom, but the cause—the awe-
some power of the group—would re-
main untouched. And the power of
the group continues throughout the
individual’s association with the fra-
ternity.

Thinking out loud about attending
the Artist Series brings jeers in some
houses, raised éyebrows and smiles
in others. Nevertheless, the pressure,
no matter what form, is present. Only
the most strong-minded individual
overcomes the pressure: most indi-
viduals tacitly—and usually unwit-
tingly—submit.

What then must be done? How can
the advantages of the present system
best be maintained while the evils are
eradicated?

The seareh for the answer to this
basic question led to formation of the
Fraternity Evaluation Committee and
the issuance of the committee’s report
tonight.

Significant is the fact that 11 of the
12 members of the committee—an
overwhelming majority — generally
agree with the statement of premise
and the analysis of the problem in the
committee report Furthermore, and
most important of all, 11 of the 12
members of the committee support
the adoption of the immediate pro-
posals contained in the committee
report.

We likewise urge the implementa-
tion of the immediate proposals.

Essentially, there is only one differ-
ence between the committee report
and the minority report signed by
Council, Kelton, Ross and Terry and
supported by Jackson.

The Kelton, Ross et al. report seeks
more time to study the problem and
to review the effects of the immedi-
ate proposals. The minority report
suggests that the solution might lie
in establishing eating clubs and
strengthening Lingle Manor to com-
pete effectively with the fraternities
which would be maintained basically
unchanged.

This is essentially the proposal arti-
culated by IFC President Rick von
Unwerth in November and since
abandoned by him in favor of the
committee report.

The committee report, while more
certain of what it considers the ulti-
mate solution, provides for modifi-
cation where this is considered neces-
sary. This report spells out specific
steps to follow. towards the realization
of the proposed solution. Unlike the
Kelton, Ross et al. minority report,
the committee report does not damn
certain fraternities to oblivion while
maintaining others. (Obviously if rush
were held this fall, several fraternitiés
would have “less than 40 members
for two consecutive semesters” and
the next year would not “be allowed
to occupy a house on Patterson
Court.”)

Unlike the Kelton, Ross et al. re-
port, the committee’s main solution
does not rest on the initiative of a
scattered group of individuals to come
together to form an eating club. Rath-
er than establishing completely new
eating clubs to compete with the fra-
ternities, the co ee report urges
that a strong system of 12 eating
clubs be established, using the pres-
ent fraternity system as a base.

Pragmatically, we support the com-
mittee report: It builds on the present
system. In addition, although labeled
the “most radical” of the three re-
ports, the committee report spells out.
its goal and suggests a slow step-by-
step process that would take five
years before the goal would be real-
ized.

Idealistically, we support the .com-
mittee report: Eliminated would be
the exclusive fraternity in the Christ-
jan college. In its place would be a
system in which each individual, as
an individual, would have the freedom
to choose that house in which he

wished to eat. The freedom of choice .

would be abridged by nothing other
than the physical facilities of. the club
house. And, with the removal of the
blackball system and the demise of
the all-powerful and exclusive fra-
ternities, the impact of group pres.
sure—both blatant and subtle—would
be greatly lessened, leaving a much
freer individual to pursue the liberal
arts education so strongly supported
by Davidson College. '

Without any doubt, this editorial
has caused us more pain and anguish
than any other statement in the past
year, and not without reason. Our
association with the fraternity system
has always been friendly, and in our
four years at Davidson our relation-
ship with the system has heen in-
creasingly close.

Were our decision based on our
own personal position within the sys-
tem at the present and nothing more,
we would be staunch defenders of the
status quo. However, looking beyond
ourselves, we see stagnation, wasted
potential, and snobbish mediocrity
among far too many fraternity mem-
bers. Meanwhile, sitting beyond the
inner circle on Patterson Court are
many students—all acceptable by the
Standards of Davidson College—re-
jected all too often for no reason
other than their lack of superficial
coolness.

Change, no matter how unpopular,
must come. And the change must
strike at the origin rather than the
outward signs of the problem: it is
for this reason that we endorse with-
out qualification the report of the
Fraternity Evaluation Committee.

Student Opposes
Mercury Lamps

Dear Editor:

.After reading the March 5
DAVIDSONIAN article on the
proposed lighting system. I went
with two other students to talk
to College Engineer Grover
Meetze. Mr. Meetze said that
the College administration had
been considering this action
ever since a student was mug-
ged one night several yéars ago,
and that only ‘90% of the stu-
dent body against it’’ covid stop
the system's installatiep,

Aside from the fact that the
student refered to was attacked
at the brilliantly-lighted post
office, there are two main ob-
jections to the installation of
this type of lighting: the unsight-
liness of the lamps themselves
and of the light produced.

Mr. Meetze had attempted to
find a “traditional” lamp de-
sign, but since none were avail-
able he was forced to choose
the least offensive. The result
is an aluminum-and.glass affair
resembling a bird feeder on a
pole, one of which stood behind
Elm Row for several weeks ‘in
the fall.

These fixtures will be laid out
in three rows on the West front
lawn without regard to any
campus buildings, providing a
“pleasing” complement to the
skeletal gifts of the Class of ‘31
whose job it is to illuminate
Chambers.

The 1931 spotlights are vastly
superior to the proposed mer-
cury-vapor system in their light.
however, which casts a dim and
warm yellow glow on the facade
of Chambers. Anyone who has
seen the bluish-white glare of
a mercury lamp will realize
what it will do the nighttime
beauty of the Davidson campus.
With its starry night sky and
softly floodlit buildings, the Da.
vidson campus creates now a
handsome and familiar after-
dark impression.

If the new system is installed,
the campus will look less like a
traditional Southern college and
more like Charlotte Correctional

_ Institution.

Davidson men may shudder at
the Vow, smolder about the
Speaker Ban, and chafe at
liquor regulations, but since
when have the D. Gentlemen
been afraid of the dark?

arat errors of fact in the let-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Angry Alumnus Centers
Fire On Bus-ter Ramberg | 'Small But Significant’

Dear Editor:
My February 19th DAVIDSON-

IAN arrived today, bearing As-
sociate Editor Ramberg's catchy
but purblind comments re “hired
hardwood heroes.” Possessing

enviable wisdom, writer Ram-
berg has resolved a perplexing
and long-standing problem for
me: by his definition, anyone
who receives financial aid dur-
ing college is a “Professional”
—some are professional athletes
and some are professional aca-
demicians, although all are stu-
dents.

Now, I had always felt just a
little inferior to scholarship stu-
dents, since they had already
achieved a degree of success in
life by the time they entered col-
lege sufficient to warrant some-
one's (be it Baker, Danforth or
the Wildcat Club) putting out
money for their education. They
had already proven themselves
and, alas, I cowered in the cor-
ners of insecurity, paying my
own tuition—on probation, as
it were, trying to prove what
the “Professionals” had already
shown, that I was worthy of a

Davidson education. But Hal-
lelujah. Peter Ney be praised.

Sometime Editor Ramberg has
loosed my bonds of insecurity:
his frowning on ‘‘Professionals”
in college students has reassured
me that us average guys wuz
right all along.

As I read his column again
(I’ve even been known to read
Bill Buckley twice), I am a little
disturbed by the possibility that
he may actually condone profes-
sional academicians (i.e. aca-
demic scholarship) while con-
demning recognition in other
areas of superiority. Maybe’ I
don’t read him so good (he
will be the first to seek that out-
let); or maybe there were too
many exhaust fumes at the back
of the bus that day. Or maybe
(is it possible?) Bus-ter Ram-
berg really believes scholarship
funds should be limited to Merii
Scholars with perfect Sunday
School attendance records.

Comments From Germany

Dear Editor:

Now as the winter semester
in Marburg is almost over. I
feel it is possible to give a fairly
complete description of a stu-
dent's life in Germany.

The first thing that impressed
me as I came to Marburg was
the “‘academic freedom." This
is something different from the
concept of academic freedom in
America. German “academic
freedom" means not only free-
dom of thought, but also freedom
of action on the part of both
students and teachers,

Although the student is limited
as to the number of semester
hours he can register for (be-
tween 4 and 50), he is not com-
pelled to attend a single class.
Forcing a professor to do some-
thing against his will is abso-
lutely unheard of in West Ger-
many.

This freedom comes as some-
what of a shock to the German
students as well. The Gymnas-
ium, more or less a state-run
prep school, makes even David-
son look like a bastion of liber-
ty. Despite this difference the
problems of adjustment are
usually solved rather quickly.

The fact that a German pupil
receives a more intensive edu-
cation than an American conid
have a great deal to do with
this. A student who has come
out of a modern language Gym-
nasium, for example, has al-
ready had eight years of Enz.
lish, six of Latin, and two of
calculus, as well as physics «nd
chemistry.

Contrary to what many Ameri-
cans believe (and to what I
thought before I came here), the
German university is not just a
training center for specialists.
A student must have a major
and two minors.

In addition, he must pass the
Philosophicum,”” an exam
made up of sections on philoso-

and psychology. He spends more
time studying each of these sub-
jects than a Davidson student
does on-his minor.

Still, in the battle between
studying and freedom, freedom
usually wins out. The recreation
program at Marburg is broad.
offering courses from judo to
gliding. However, perhaps the
most popular form of recreation
(next to those just up the road)
is politics. This interest is mir-
rored in the constant fights be-
tween: the student newspapers,

Three of these, all monthlies,
are published in Marburg. and
there are others which have na-
tion-wide circulation. Of the
Marburg papers two are center-
left (one of these is supported
by compulsory subscription) and
one is radical-right.

The letter does everything
short of calling itself Nazi. (It
made no objection when the of-
ficial university paper accident-
ly printed ‘‘national socialism”
instead of “nationalism” in an
article about it.) It has also
accused the mayoress of the
“Studentendorf" (the largest
dormitory. with around 800 -stu-
dents) of being a very rosy red.

Although there are no com-
munist groups, the left wing of
the SPD student organization
keeps in contact with the com-
rades to the East. The German
student papers often make even
THE DAVIDSONIAN look duil.

I hope this letter has been in-
formative and perhaps has
cleared up a few misconceptions
about Gérmany in general and
German students in particular.

Dear Editor:
It has been suggested to me
that some of your readers are

phy, political science, education, probably wondering, “Why does

one want to study in Europe?”
To me, there are several com-
pelling reasons. These will be,
of course, completely inconse-
quential to some.

The two most obvious reasons
are the opportunities to travel
and to become intimate with a
foreign language. . . .

Another reason is that the
life at a German University is
a very pleasant one. When given
a chance, the students. are very
friendly and one can easily form
valuable friendships. The life is
unhurried, uncluttered, and
spiced with such pleasantries as
concerts, plays, feasts, or just
plain conversation in a ‘‘Bierkel-
ler.”

The familiar American stress
and strain is lacking. The lone
reason for loss of sleep is that
one stayed out too late celébrat-
ing (almost anything is suffici-
ent reason for celebrating).

One must also study, but there
is ample time for both studying
and socializing. For the interest-
ed student, there are great op-
portunities for study. The study
of the Reformation becomes
more exciting when one can see
some of the very halls Luther
and Zwingli debated in. When
one sees the many reminders
of the Middle Ages left around
Marburg, History is suddenly
easier to understand and to re-
member.

Aside from that, one is free
to study that which interescs
him, and the facilities for such
study are enormous. That means
of course that one is also- free
not to study, but if one studies
only because he is compelled,
he is likely to learn little any-
way. The Germans seem to
have recognized this fact and
incorporated it into their Univer-
sity system.

FROM THE BACK OF THE BUS

Discriminatory Clauses:

By CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Associate Editor
Eventually the current hassle over the role of
fraternities ‘on this campus will subside, probably
leaving ‘those venerable institutions to continue to
play an important role in campus social life.

If such is the case, it will be necessary for
those with authority on the Hill to force several of
the houses to make small but significant changes
in their membership requirements.

Events have been moving in this direction ever
Since the Trustees entered the Twentieth Century on
May 17, 1962, and freed the college’s admission
policy from racial restrictions. Today the number of
Negro students in attendance is four. Surely it will
grow much larger.

During a question session in chapel November
3, 1963, President D. Grier Martin said that the col-
lege “could bring to bear almost any force it wished”
in the matter of restrictive membership. But, he
allowed, “I don’t see much prospect in the near
future that any action will be taken.”

The time is no sense in waiting while the num-
ber of students ineligible for fraternity membership
steadily mounts to embarrassing heights. Prompt
action is especially important because it takes as
much as four years for some national fraternities to
alter their constitutions.

Last week the University of North Carolina
Faculty Council took a first halting step toward ban-
ning discriminatory membership requirements of
Carolina fraternity chapters. The professors set Sept.
1, 1966 as the date by which fraternities must drop
national or local requirements that bar pledging or
initiating any University student because of his
race, creed or national origin.

The Carolina policy allows chapters to get
“Waivers” from their respective national fraterni-
ties to satisfy the University requirement.

The waiver is an evasive device that most fra-
ternities have developed since 1952, when the Hu-
man Rights Committee at the University of Wiscon-
sin told its fraternities that discriminatory member-
ship requirements must go. The committee gave Wis-
consin chapters until 1960 to change their ways.

The fraternity subterfuges that the Wisconsin
Human Rights Committee has discovered over the
past decade stand as strong reasons to believe that
an anti-discriminatory clauses policy that can be
satisfied by waivers will not be sufficient to stop
discrimination. Perhaps Carolina wil] learn Wiscon-
sin’s lesson and beef up its rules.

The Wisconsin committee has found several
ways that student-members of a fraternity can be
prevented from selecting members without regard
to race, color or creed:

b Alumni participate in voting on new. mem-
ers.

2) Any alumni member may object to a person
proposed for membership and the case may be de-
cided against the wishes of the local chapter.

_ 3) The names of pledges must be approved by
national officers before initiation.

Under the regulations effective in 1968, fra-
ternities will be required to submit two statements
to the rights committee.

CERTIFICATE 1

_ “We certify that there are no provisions in the
national or local constitution, by-laws, ritual, or any
other controlling rules of which require
the student membership to refrain from considering
for membership, pledging, electing, or initiating any
students to membership on account .of race, color,
creed, or national origin.

“We further certify

‘ that there are no provis-
ions in any of the above which indicate or imply
that any person should be considered socially or
persona y unacceptable as a member because of his
race... .’

The second certificate to be required of Wis-
consin chapters will assure that student freedom to
choose members will not be restricted by national
officers, alumni, advisers, or others from off campus
through exclusive priveleges of recommendat on,
approval privileges, or veto power.

The four professors and three students who
comprise the University of Wisconsin Human Rights
Committee are hopeful that the new set of regula-
tions will be sufficient to the task of ending dis-
crimination. Ity of

e faculty of the University of North Carolina
has made a start toward ending fraterni imi-
nation at that school. 6 Ny discrimi

How about it, Davidson?
