Alabama, will open the festival
with a lecture to the fourth per-
iod art classes. His topic will
be “The Dichotomy of Creative

New Fallout Committee
In Charge Of Shelters

Devidsonian Assistant News Editor

Where should the students in Richardson dorm go in case of radio-active fallout?
Or the students in East? Or Cannon? Or any dorm? What plans do we need for

emergencies of this kind?

Answering these questions is
one of the purposes for the es-
tablishment this week of a new
faculty Fallout Preparedimess
Committee, under the leader-
ship of Dr. S. D. Maloney.

The committee's purpose, ac-
cording to Maloney, is to “have
the responsibility of supervising
the preparation for the program
of civil defense for our stud-
ents, faculty, and administrative
staff.”

We've all seen the civil de-
fense signs around campus.
What more is being done?

Until now only preliminary
work has been done informally
by President D. Grier Martin,
Business Manager Robert Cur-
rie, Physical Plant Director
Grover C. Meetze, and Dr. John
I. Hopkins, professor of physics.

Last year en infermal sur-
vey was made as the first step
in initisting « civil defense:
pregram at Davidson. The re

‘| sults showed thet there is suf-

ficient fallout protection for
tire college, but only with en
expenditure of $1000-$15,
C00 fo stock and complete
theve sreas.

Step two was a federal fallout

ishelter survey. In their report
last January, Civil Defense said | ast semester by the Sigma Nus,| Plan, Medical Care and Mental

What about the effects of a
blast?

Maloney, also the deputy di-
rector of civil defense for the
town of Davidson, said that as
far as he knows there is no place
in North Carolina that is a
“number one target area.”

Red Cross Greets
Pupils Aiter Break

The American Red Cross
Bloodmobile will be at Johnston
Gymnasium April 89 from 11

Jam. to 5 p.m. each day.

| This is the second blood drive
lof the year and is sponsored by
.the ROTC Department and the
Interfraternity Council. Mrs.
Mildred Alexander is the co-
ordinator of the Davidson wom-
en who will assist the Red Cross
in this project.

As-in the last drive, donors
will be given a free cut from

"| ROTC drill and gym classes.

Those. under 21 who wish to
donate blood must have a. con-
sent form: signed by their par-

‘ents. These forms are available
.in:the ROTC Department..

He feels there is flttle focal
danger of a blest. “Our pur.
pose here,” said Mstony, “is .
primarily, then, for « fallout
shelter.”

Since this college is a “pub-
lic shelter area,” what. happens
if more than the total capacity,
coming from the surrounding
areas, try to enter our shelters?

Director Williams made it
clear that our fallout facilities
would be for the use of.the town
and college only and that other
Mecklenburg County population
would “not be directed this
way.”

According to Maloney the
preparation and publication of
plans for exacuation to assign-
ed areas during a fallout per-
iod will be the responsibility
of an Education, Training snd
Personnel Assignment sub-
committee which will. wark
feintly with students.

The president of the Student
Council will probably become
a standing member of thiis sxb-
committee.
