out the dilemma of small colleges like Davidson in at-
tempting to-maintain reasonably good football teams. The
editorial presented the problem as insolvable. Perhaps
it is. Let’s look at the case of Furman.

Furman, a fellow member of the Southern Confer-
ence, has a total enrollment somewhat larger than that
of Davidson, but they share many of the same difficulties
and pressures that we do in building and keeping good
teams. Several years ago, Furman decided, under certain
pressures, to greatly increase the number of scholarships
that they offered, in an attempt to develop a “winning”
athletic program.

Most sports at Furman received some support from
this program. Football scholarships were increased,
basketball scholarships increased, and aid was even given
to the cross-country team.

What has been the result of this program?

It fared not as well as its planners hoped. Furman’s
football teams had some moments of glory, but they were
never able to challenge any of the bigger powers, even in
South Carolina. Last year, Furman. stopped giving both
tennis and cross-country scholarships.

Just before Christmas; Furman University officials
announced the abandonment of their old program of
scholarships, and the adoption of a grant-in-aid plan for
scholarships on a one year trial: basis, Rising costs and
dwindling receipts were cited as,reasons for the move.

This new plan stipulates that prospective athletes
will be scree to determine whether they are academi-
ee then the p ect’s financial need will be
stu . Aid will be awarded commerisurate with need.
This aid will be in the form $f scholarships, loans, or
jobs—not to exceed tuition, room, and board.

This plan, if it works, will by no means solve all of
Furman’s problems. They still want to have good teams,
but now that will be even more difficult. They will un-
doubtedly incur greater recruiting problems. No, Fur-
man’s problems aren't over, but they have decided that
they had to do something to get out of the expensive
rat-race that they found themselves in.

We commend Furman of tryitig ‘to face a difficult
problem fairly and reasonably.

As for Davidson, we suggest a look at Furman’s
present problems before we ever seriously consider a
major change in our athletic program.

The ‘Cats’ record so far this
season is a respectable 2-2. In
the month of December they
were victorious over South Caro-

while suffering defeat at the
hands of Duke (38-55) and East

Shoe praised the team, saying
that they've “looked very good”

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

Listening to Tuesday ‘night’s game with West Vir-

several games. Why has Davidson’s cinderella team
slowed down? When will it snap out of it?

It is difficult to play a team as good as West Virginia
anywhere much less on their home court, and it is no
disgrace to lose to them. But by eighteen points? And
on top of that, being almost run off the court by the
Mountaineer’s fast break.

We would not be so concerned if this were a ’Cat
basketball team of the past, after all, they were supposed
to lose, weren't they? The reason that we are concerned
is that we believe in the team, and know they have the
potential to do great things (Not anybody can beat Duke.)

For a team made up of outstanding individual play-
ers, it seems a strange that no more than one or two
of them can be really hot in any _ Perhaps it won’t

the ’Cats in three of their. last four games would seem
to indicate that something is wrong.

any way, but some lesson may be learned from it.
Basketball players are ‘6nly human and they need a
break every once in a while—to forget the pressure.
In any case, much of the season remains before the
’Cats, and we hope, and believe, they can snap out of
this slump and show that the Duke win wasn’t a fluke.

Bolstered by Terry Holland's
cool clutch playing, Davidson's
erratic Wildcats overcame a 7
point deficit in the last two
minutes of the contest with Wil-
liam and Mary on January 2,
and came back to whip the In-
dians 73-70 in overtime.

Holland’s performance in this
game won him this week’s Wild-
cat of the Week Honor. The 6-7
forward calmly sank two free
throws to knot the score 63-63
with 25 seconds remaining and
added 4 free throws in the extra

margin. His aggressive play in
the front court kept Davidgon in
the game. He grabbed 11 re
bounds and netted 18 points
during the contest.

“He played real well the en-
tire game and really came
through for us in the clutch,”

Driesell on his pupil.
As center Fred Hetzel narrow-

a field goal with 1:50 left, he
was fouled. Holland tapped in
Hetzel’s missed free throw, key-
ing the Wildcats’ rally which
eventually brought them vic-

er. In Davidson’s 89-73 loss to

After Christmas vacation on
January 2, Davidson beat Wil-
liam and Mary here in an over-

time thriller 73-70. The ‘Cats
fought from a ntne point deficit
with about five minutes remain-
ing in the game to tie the con-

test 63-63 at the end of regula-
tion play.

High-scorers for Davidson
were Hetzel and Holland with
18 points apiece.

Last Saturday East Carolina
journeyed here to play the Wild-
cats. Davidson pulled away from
a scant 33-31 halftime advantage
to down E.C. 71-61. Again Fred
Hetzel was top scorer with 29
points, matching his previous
career high against Wofford.

On Tuesday the ’Cats met de
feat for the fourth time this
season when they traveled to
Morganton, West Virginia, to
play the Mountaineers of West
Virginia University. Led by All-
American Rod Thorn’s 28 points,
the Mountaineers defeated the
‘Cats 89-73. High for Davidson
were Holland with 22 points and
Hetzel with 20.

This is the highest honor that
a wrestling coach can earn in
this non-omympic year. A coach
is only eligible to be chosen
once.

Parker is the only wrestling
coach from this area of the
country who has ever been so
honored. He was chosen over
several hundred coaches across
the country.

During the recent Christmas

Committee. This summer he at-
tended the World Championship
Tournament in Toledo in which
87 nations competed and while
there he was one of the six out

While attending a meeting of the Olympic Committee in Detroit on the 28th of
last November, Charlie Parker, Davidson wrestling coach, was informed that he had
been selected by fellow coaches to head this year’s United States wrestling team in

year prior to the Olympics.
Parker. hopes to bring the U.S.
team to Davidson for one week
of training in early April, then
he will leave for Brazil. The
Games will be held in Sao Paulo,
Brazil, from April 20 to May 5.

Parker may or may not return
with a vietory, but he will re-
turn to Davidson having fulfill-
ed a capacity few coaches can
hope to attain.

holidays tryouts for the Pan-
Am games were held. and out of
a field of 122 of the nation’s
top wrestlers, eight were chosen
for the team.

Parker watched the three day
tryouts, and feels that the final
eight men constitute “probably
the best wrestling team ever
assembled in the United States.”

The selection is not the only
feather in Parker's cap, though
it is certainly the finest. As a
senior’ on the 1938 Davidson
wrestling team he finished three
years of wrestling with only two
defeats. After coaching for one
year he declined an offer to pre-
pare for entering into law prac-
tice with his uncle to continue
