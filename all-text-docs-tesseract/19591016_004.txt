Miss Ann Dana Chats
With Local Students

Miss Ann Dana sat quietly at the corner of the sofa
in the Kappa Alpha Fraternity House. A china saucer
rested in the palm of her left hand and a cup in her
right. “What do you think of our beautiful campus?”

THE DAVIDSONIAN

| A “Portrait Of Leadership

(Editor’s note: Following are excerpts from the tribute paid Mr. Charlies A. Dana for
his lesdership as evidenced by his many successeful ventures. The program, arranged by

Mr. Robert Sallsted, was presented at a buncheon in honor of Mr. Dana and the Trustees of |

the Dana Foundation.)

This is a simple story of an American—a man who personifies what commence-
ment orators are apt to call a “leader among men’”—a man whose life exempli-
'fies how an individual with vision, personal initiative, and imagination can provide
j the spark that brings steady progress and purposeful growth to a free enterprise

“You express my thoughts ficials:

exactly,” she replied.

Miss Dana was surrounded by
Davidson Gentlemen, eager to.
make some impression on their
important visitor.

The house was tastefully
decorated and several silver
trays held cookies and cake.
Mrs. Little poured coffee for
the guests who mingled about
the house.

Questions began to be direct-
ed more to the special guest.
Miss Dana told of their trip
South from New York. The par-
ty left last Wednesday and
went to St. Petersburg, Florida,
for a tour of the Stetson Law
College. They flew to Atlanta
and drove to the Berry School
for Boys and Berry College in
Rome, Georgia, before coming
to Davidson on Tuesday. Brush-
ing a cake crumb from her
dress, Ann said that when they.
left Davidson that the party
would see Queens and Guilford
College before returning to
New York.

“I went to ‘the. Ethel Walker
School and studied in Switzer-
land for three years,” she said,
“and now I work as a nurse's
aid at Memorial Hospital in
New York.”

Ann loves to ski, but con-
siders. languages her favorite
hobby. She said that Spanish
and French were her best.
