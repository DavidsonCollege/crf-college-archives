Before the game began,

yur | linebacker Erik Moledor, line-

guard Ashton Lloyd and wide re-
ceiver-quarterback Matt Matheny
received the honors.

Charleston Southern took an
early lead when Maurice Gerald
blocked a Drew Fassett punt and
raced 13 yards for the touchdown.
Davidson’s misfortune continued
after the ‘Cats reached the Bucca-
neers’ two-yard line at the end of
the first stanza. Shane Mills car-
ried on first down to move the
‘Cats to the one-yard line. On sec-
ond down, Richard Howell was
sacked at the nine. Chris Toney

The men’s soccer team man-
aged two wins and a tie in three
matches against Big South oppo-
nents this week. The ‘Cats played
Winthrop last Sunday to a score-
less tie. On Wednesday night, they
beat Charleston Southern 2-1 inan
away match. And in a homecom-
ing game on Saturday night, the
team scored late in the second half
to top Coastal Carolina 1-0. The
week left the team with a 4-1-1
record in the Big South and a 7-8-
2 record overall.

The scoreless Winthrop game

| wasa frustrating one for the Wild-
| cats. “This is a game we should

have won,” said junior Matt Spear.

By Chris Hood
“Enthusiasm, intensity and fun.”
These are the words Head Coach

Bob McKillop used to describe the
first week of practice for the mens’
basketball squad. “It seems kind of
contradictory, but the players are
very loose and very focused,” said
1 McKillop:

In attempting to pinpoint the
‘Cats encouraging week, McKil-

: lop pointed to the successful end of

N= | the 1990-1991 season. “The guys

have a quiet sense of confidence
not justabout basketball buta self-
esteem that they feel about what
they’re doing for Davidson Col-
lege,” said McKillop.

Since the ‘Cats first exhibition
contest will not be played until
November 9, McKillop is not yet
concerned about starting lineups,
but he is pleased with the talent on

of the contest with ten seconds
remaining in the half. Kelly Shirley
pulled in a five-yard pass from
Howell to cap off an impressive
14-play, 64-yard drive. When
Fassett’s extra point missed wide,

the Bucs held a slim 7-6 halftime
advantage.

“Coach Fagg really exploded on
us at halftime,” Howell said.
“There was a lot of yelling and
screaming.”

“We knew we were a better team,
yet we couldn’t get the ball in the
net.” \

Clearly, Davidson was the
better team. The Wildcats con-
trolled the ball for the majority of
the game and outshot the opposi-
tion in both halves. After the game
Coach Charlie Slagle stressed to
his team the importance of putting
high pressure on a less-talented
team. Winthrop was contentto play
adefensive, conservative game and
Slagle later told his team that in
such a situation they needed to
make them play.

The Charleston Southern game
provided the Wildcats with an
opportunity to show their coach

the team. “T have at least two ca-

pable players at every position,

said McKillop.
Although Davidson’s future cer-
tainly looks promising, there isone

leston Southern to open the second

what they had learned against
Winthrop. Charleston Southern
was more talented than Winthrop,
but the ‘Cats still felt they were a
better team. Ben Hayes continued
to emerge offensivley with a first
half goal to give the Wildcats an
early lead. The goal came off of a
corner kick and was assisted by
Cliff Castelloe.

Charleston Southern came
back to tie the game on a breaka-
way goal. The contest remained
tied until the final minutes. At the
6 minute mark junior Preston
Yarborough scored off a perfectly
executed cross by Glenn Smith.
The play was particularly pleasing

Though the Bucs were up 14-12,
the lead would be their last.
Davidson scored on its third
straight possession when Howell
found John Bodkin and completed
a 31-yard attempt. Jebo Barnes
caught a Howell pass on the two-
point conversion play and the
‘Cats were up for good, 20-14.

The Bucs’ next drive may have
provided the turning point of the
match. Sean Smith gained 59
yards on a pass reception which
put Charleston Southern inside
the ‘Cats ten-yard line.
Davidson’s defense held off the
charge and only surrendered a
field goal, the Bucs’ final points
of the day.

Howell scampered 42 yards for
the ‘Cats third score of the half to
open the fourth quarter in giving

ball up along the left side towards
the near post and then crossed the
ball to Yarborough directly in front
of the goal.

The Chanticleers of Coastal
Carolina are the defending Big
South champions, having beaten
Davidson in last year’s champion-
ship game, and are considered one
of the league’s stronger teams this
season. This game was an impor-
tant test for the ‘Cats and helped

Radford, as the “team to beat” in

while playing fora club team in his
native Italy. At that point Ferroni
was unaware that he would end up
at an American college or univer-
Sity.

Once Ferroni began to be re-
cruited by American schools, he
made certain not to accept any
such rewards. “He knew the NCAA
rules and didn’t want to be in vio-
lation,” said McKillop.

Nevertheless, Davidson felt it
necessary toalertthe NCAA of the
situation. Now, the College is -
waiting for an NCAA eligibility
committee to rule on Ferroni’s
status. McKillop is unsure when
the committee will make its
decision. “I hope the NCAA evalu-
ates not just the letter of the law,
but statements about Franco’s -
personal life,” said McKillop.
