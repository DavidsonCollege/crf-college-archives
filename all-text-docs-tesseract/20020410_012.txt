THe DAVIDSONIAN

WEDNESDAY,
Apri 10, 2002

Baseball is a game of numbers, and,
while Davidson has been putting up some
impressive offensive stats recently, the
Wildcats have been unable to convert runs
into victories, dropping five of their last
eight games. Despite outscoring their op-
ponents 59-49 over that eight-game stretch,
the Davidson nine has failed to find any
consistency at the plate.

Facing High Point nearly two weeks
ago, the diamond ’Cats scored only a single
run and lost to the Panthers 11-1.

The lone run for the Wildcats came in
the third inning when junior DJ Dailey
singled in freshman Eli Benefield, who
drew a leadoff walk and advanced into
scoring position when senior Jack Purcell
rapped a one-out single through the left
side.

Looking to pick up some ground in the
Southern Conference, Davidson embarked
on a six-game conferénce road trip over
Easter Break, playing three games at both
Wofford and Appalachian State.

Senior Tim Frend (2-2) held Wofford to
just two runs off seven hits, while striking
out nine against three walks as he went the
distance for the second time this season.
Freshman Michael Muniz ignited the of-
fense, going 2-for-4 with 2 runs and an
RBI, and senior Steven Aldrich drove in
two more as Davidson improved its con-
ference record to 3-7 with the 4-2 victory.

A day later, Frend wielded a big stick at
the plate, going 4-for-5 with a three-run
homer, as the Wildcats won the morning
game 14-3. Senior right-hander Mark Wells
(3-3) allowed just one earned run on eight
hits en route to Davidson’s second con-
secutive complete-game victory.

Senior co-captain James Marino rounds first base. Marino picked up five RBIs against High Point.

up five RBI off three hits, while Dailey and
freshman Sam Navarro both recorded three
base knocks as Davidson triumphed by
their largest margin all year. The runs
stopped there though, as Wofford shutout
the ’Cats 5-0 in the rain-shortened after-
noon game.

Against ASU, Davidson rattled off 15
hits and held-on to beat the Mountaineers
11-9, improving
their record to 13-
17 and 5-8:in the
SoCon. Purcell led
all hitters, going 4-
for-6 with two runs
and 3 RBI, while
five Davidson bat-
ters had multi-hit
games to pace the of-
fense.

Sophomore hurler
Matt Dellinger (2-2)
picked up the win by
pitching 5.2 solid in-
nings, and junior
Matt Hood recorded
his first save of the
season.

off 27 hits in a doubleheader sweep the
following day to take two of three from the
Cats and win the three-game series. David-
son fell 8-3 in the front end of the twinbill
despite an impressive two-way perfor-
mance from Frend (2-3), who went 4-for-
5 with an RBI but also took the loss.

The Wildcats scored one in the ninth and
then loaded the bases with one out, but a
double play with the tying run on deck
squelched the potential rally.

Frend’s double in the first inning was
the 53rd of his career, breaking the David-
son record. The Wildcats were held to four
runs off five hits in game two and dropped

to 5-10 in conference play with the 6-4 . a

loss.

Finally back at the friendly confines of
Wildcat Park, Davidson played host to
UNC-Ashville last Wednesday. For their
part, the Wildcats banged out 20 hits and
put 12 runs on the board, but that proved
inadequate as the Bulldogs handed David-
son its 20th loss of the 2002 campaign.

Offensively for Davidson, Navarro went
5-for-5 with three RBIs, while Frend and
fellow senior Trae Fletcher each contrib-
uted three hits in the losing effort.

The diamond ’Cats next take the field
this Friday when they travel to Furman to
take on the Paladins for a three-game week-
end series.
