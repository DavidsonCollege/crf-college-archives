THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, APRIL 18, 1994

The art now showing in the VAC

By Tom Mew |

Selected pieces from
Davidson’s Permanent Collection
are currently on display in the Wil-
liam Van Every Gallery of the
VAC. The pieces are quite impres-
sive and reflect both the quality
and diversity of the Davidson col-
lection. The show covers a wide
range of both styles and mediums
and contains many excellent pieces
by famous artists. Many fine pieces,
including a Rembrandt etching,
were donated by supporters of the
college, a testament to the support
that exists for visual arts at
Davidson. Other works were pur-
chased by the college and some,
such as Roger Manly’s “Skull,”

are gifts from the artists themselves.

Anumberof different types of
works are on display. The photog-
raphy collection is quite impres-
sive and includes a striking picture
by Diane Arbus. There are also a
number of fine abstract works on
display, including “Clam Digger,”
a lithograph by world-renowned
painter Willem de Kooning. Of
particular local interest is a steam-
roller print by Andy Owen, which
was created at the groundbreaking
ceremony forthe V.A.C. Although
the show features pieces by sev-
eral international painters, there
are also works by regional artists,
such as “ Earth, Heaven, and Hell”
by Georgia folk artist Howard

Finster.

The show also features sev-
eral smaller pieces by some of the
true masters of art. Etchings by
artists such as Edward Hopper and
Goya are very powerful and im-
pressive. This collection offers
Davidson students ‘an excellent
chance tosee for themselves works
by artists they often only read about.
Particularly impressive is Munch’s
“Die Weiben,” a beautiful and
haunting piece.

The exhibition is a testament
to the strength of the Davidson
collection. Art lovers should take
advantage of the opportunity to
see such a fine collection in a local
setting.
