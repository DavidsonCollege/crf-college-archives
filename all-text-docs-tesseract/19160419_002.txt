THE BLANKET FEE,

A new question—new to Davidson—
has been agitated of late by thoughtful
men on the campus. This is the ques-
tion of instituting a blanket fee.

Last Fall “Preacher” Morrison, from
amid clouds of Tuxedo, announced to
“Chief” Mullen’s feet, which were perch-
ed on the table nearby, that he was going
to canvass the student body in behalf of
the Annual, Walls have ears, for the
information leaked out, and Preacher
wondered why so many rooms were
empty that night. The Treasurer of the
Y. M.C. A. had a similar experience—.
only worse. The men who tried to sell
season athletic tickets relate a still more
pathetic story. And three hundred and
fifty students can testify that those
money seekers are pests.

A more practical, and withal a more
important consideration yet. But little
over a third of the Student Body at-
tends the average ball game. So when
a man pavs his forty-five cents for
admission, he pays fifteen cents for him-
self, fifteen cents for the tight-wad who
plays horse shoes instead, and fifteen
cents for the book-worm who “has a re-
view.” In the same way we pay from
two to three times as much for each col-
lege activity as we should.

The blanket fee will do away with
these two evils of canvassing and high
prices, and will put all on a more busi-
ness-like basis. At present, for the five
college activities, season ticket, Y. M. C.
A., Annual, Davidsonian, and Maga-
zine, a man pavs from twelve to fifteen
dollars. ‘The blanket fee in short is
this: Each student will pay along with his
college dues a sum of six dollars (ap-
proximately) and be entitled to the five
aforementioned things. This will be
possible, for it will be paid by every man.
and the managers will have cash on
hand. The students will pay their six
instead of twelve dollars, and thereafter
sit in undisturbed tranquility, without

the embarrassment of telling the old tale
about “being broke,” and bank accounts
will suffer fewer relapses.

This system has been adopted by
many universities with great success.
What hinders Davidson from ranking
with other leading colleges in this
matter ?

A SUGGESTION.

A glance in the Y. M. C. A. reading
rooms of Charlotte and other cities will
show annuals of various colleges and
universities, but none of Davidson. And
yet the Davidson Annual has no superior
in the South. Where there are so many
prospective collegians, would it not be a
good advertisement to the college to
place a Davidson annual in their hands?

Y. M. C. A. MEETING.

At the Y. M. C. A. meeting Thurs-
day night, N. P. Farrior, of the Senior
class, gave a very interesting and in
structive talk on “The Call to the For-
cign Field.” He spoke of those to whom
the call comes, what constitutes a call,
and the kind of work to be done in the
field. ‘he speaker gave some startling
facts about the vast need of more work-
ers, and the scarcity of laborers now in
the field.

It was announced that at the next
meeting some stercopticon slides of the
Blue Ridge Student Conference would
he shown and the work and opportuni-
ties of the conference outlined.

GOLF ‘TOURNAMENT BEGINS.

While base ball is in the ascendancy
in Davidson's athletic world, golf is also
becoming a popular and an interesting

_[sport. Carl Anderson, a professional,
,| visited Davidson some time ago and the

interest in golf has been greatly in-
creased by his exhibition, The qualify-
ing rounds for the annual spring handi-
cap tournament were played Tuesday,

sor Currie, Dr. McConnell and Dr.
Arbuckle. Peters played Clark Mon-
day, resulting in a victory for the latter.
The finals will begin the latter part of
the week.
