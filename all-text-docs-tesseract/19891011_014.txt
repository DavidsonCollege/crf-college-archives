Injuries take toll, Davidson drops three

By GIGGY MAXWELL
Fordham 14 - Davidson 12

This was supposed to be the revenge
game. Last years Fordham - Davidson
clash, which found the Wildcats at the
shortend ofa 9-3 final, was one of three
key games that supposedly decided the
division change issue in the minds of
Davidson trustees. It was a game in
which the Wildcats had dominated sta-
tistically, yet couldn’t find the endzone.

One minute into the game Davidson
was onits way toavenging this loss. DB
Mike Noonan intercepted a Fordham
pass and returned it to the Ram 36 yard
line. A penalty gave the Wildcats first
and tenon Fordham’s 21. Two minutes
later a James Brown field goal gave
Davidson a 3 - 0 lead.

Before the quarter was over, Davidson
had put another field goal on the board
behind the running of FB Brian Kelly,
who broke free fora 48 yard run during
the drive.

Although leading by six points, the
Wildcats’ first few possessions were
telling. The offensive line was not open-
ing holes consistently for Wildcat run-
ning backs. Davidson’s defense was
dominating the line but the offense con-
tinued the scoring drought that has
plagued it all season. Until late in the
fourth quarter, Davidson’s offense
could get nocloser than the Fordham 37
yard line.

Despite these problems, Wildcat rush-
ers still managed to grind out 230 yards
on the day, with Brian Kelly’s 79 yards

leading the way. But with the passing
attack completing only 4 of 16 passes,
none in the first half, the opposing de-
fense could key on the rushers all day.

The Wildcats still could haveemerged
victorious had it not been for a key
injury to DL Kenny Nazemetz late in the
firsthalf. Up until that point Fordham’s
main running back had accumulated
only 31 yards on the ground. In the
second half he scampered through
Wildcat defenders for more than 80
yards.

Behind this rejuvenated rushing at-
tack, Fordham scored late in the first
half and again early in the fourth quar-
ter. The 14 - 6 advantage proved too
much for the Wildcat offense to handle.
A late score pulled the Wildcats to
within two, buta failed two point con-
version and on-side kick sealed
Davidson’s fate.

JC Smith 18-Davidson 15

As I stood on the sidelines on mud
infested Memorial Stadium, with 32
‘sé¢onds remaining in the Wildcat’s
game against the Golden Bulls from
Johnson C. Smith, the gears between my
ears started turning. Two years ago the
Wildcats had allowed a last minute
touchdown to Catawba which spoiled
their hopes for victory. Last season
Davidson led ETSU in the fourth quar-
ter only to have a long kickoff return
and subsequent touchdown ruin the
day’seffort. Now leading 15-12, would
history repeat itself?

It couldn’t. It wouldn’t dare. The
Wildcats’ own comeback had been too
heroic. Two picture-perfect fourth
quarter scoring drives, the last one cul-
minating in a'20 yard touchdown pass
from Peter Hughes to TE Tony Lambert
which gave the ‘Cats their three point
lead. Tailback Ralph Isernia had fol-
lowed up his MVP performance in the
Pride Bowl becoming the first Wildcat
to break the century barrier in rushing
yards during a single game this season.

. Peter Hughes’s return to action after a

hand injury saw him complete 8 of 14
water-logged passes for over 100 yards.

The Wildcat defense did its part as
well bringing J. C. Smith’s star quarter-
back, Maurice Flowers, back down to
earth as he tasted mud on several occa-
sions.

The Wildcats couldn’t lose.

32 seconds later I was engulfed by a
silence that could be heard even over
the roars of elated Johnson C. Smith
fans. A desperation pass from 20 yards
out had bounced off one J.C. Smith re-
ceiver, after he had been hit by DB Mike
Noonan, into the hands of one of J.C.
Smith’s blocking backs. His dive for the
ball carried him into the endzone.

The clock read :00. The scoreboard, 18
- 15.

Charlotte Observer columnist Tom
Sorenson called the game “the best in
the Carolinas on Saturday, if not the
world”. Somehow that didn’t make the
outcome any casier to swallow. —

Wagner 35 - Davidson 11

Neither rain nor sleet nor Hurricane
Hugo could keep Newark, New Jer-
sey’s Pride Bowl festivities from taking
place September 23. Unfortunately, the
Wildcats wasted an M.V.P. effort from
tailback-by-default Ralph Isernia, and
fell to a 1-2 record as 1987 Division III
Champion Wagner College defeated
Davidson 35-11 before a crowd of 7,200
in the Cats’ biggest test of the season to
date.

“When we scheduled the Dayton and
Wagner games we knew they would
most likely be losses, but we at least

‘expected to give them both a run for

their money,” said Gatto.

Davidson’s next game is against
Methodist on Saturday, Oct. 14, at 1:30.
The game will be away at Fayetteville.

BOY 6

Can’t help but notice those peppy ‘Ca

ts ..

By ROBERT GRUBB

Davidson’s first football vic-
tory in over a year gave fans
something to cheer about last
month at Richardson field. But
the football team wasn’t the
only thing that the students
were yelling about. The much
improved cheerleading squad
transferred their enthusiasm
to the Davidson crowd.

“Having something to cheer
about, like the football win, is
important,” said Bob Price, as-
sistant athletic director. “But I
think that the cheerleaders
generated some of the excite-
ment from their own enthusi-
asm.” ;

The members of this year’s
squad are: Meredith Gabel,
Tina Smith, LeAnn Simmons,
Barbara Defenbaugh, Amy
Norwood, Heather Hindsley
and Michelle Green.

Fans weren’t the only ones
who got a.boost from this en-
thusiastie cheerleading squad.

“It was fantastic to see the
players’ faces when we got the
crowd into the game,” said
cheerleader Gabel.

“The crowd noise was a big
change from last year--crowd
noise always, helps,” said: de-
fensive back Andy Hunt. “The
cheerleaders have put up ban-
ners and we've gotten a lot of
support, which is a change
from last year.”

The students’ excitement re-
flected improvements in this

year’s cheerleading squad.
Four of the seven chcerleaders
returned from last year’s
squad.

“Cheerleading is something
that in the past people have
participated in for one year
and then quit,” said Gabel.

The cheerleaders have a
larger group this year and
have made changes. One addi-
tion is a “mike man.” Fresh-

man Anthony Fox led the stu-
dents in cheers at the first
game. The squad also imple-
mented new cheers to get the
students involved. .
“We have gone around to
the Patterson Court houses to
teach the fans new cheers,
which they will havea partin,”
said Gabel. The cheerleaders
have also put up banners be-
fore the games and on game

day wore tee shirts encourag-
ing students to attend the
game.

The squad has directly in-
volved itself with the team.
They passed out candy bags to
the players for the trip to Day-
ton two weeks ago. They have
also made uniformed appear-
ances at players’ breakfasts
and alumni functions.

“They have really done

The cheerleading squad definitely has more pep this year and students as well as athletes are taking
notice. Members of the squad are: Front—Meredith Gabel and Anthony Fox; Back--Heather Hindsley,
Anne Simmons, Amy Norwood, Michelle Green, Tina Smith and Barbara Defenbaugh.

things on their own, and with
limited resources, which is a
credit to the girls,” said Price.
“They have worked together
to try different things to make
spirit better. They have shown
up at several events where
their attendance was not re-
quired. That kind of effort
shows.”

Although much of the im-
provement is due to the girls’
own hard work and group ef-
fort, they have received guid-
ance and advice from Dana
Leonard. Leonard, a local citi-
zen, has offered her help as an
informal advisor to the cheer-
leaders. Leonard is a graduate
of UNC-Chapel Hill, where
she was a cheerleader.

“She has experience as a
cheerleader and she can give
the girls’ an objective outside
opinion of their progress,”
stated Price. “It means a lot
when someone not on the

_ Squad says, “Good job.’ Dana

gives our cheerleaders some
confidence that they really are

_ doing a good job.”

The cheerleaders realize the
importance of having every-
one enjoy themselves.

“I think the fans really had a
good time at the Millsaps
game,” said Defenbaugh. “It’s
supposed to be fun. Even if we
lose, if everyone gets together

' to support their school they

will have more’ fun, which is
the whole point.” °
