Black students go

Black students threatened to
leave Davidson at the end of the
academic year and to actively
discourage black prospective
students from coming to David-
son if a list of demands were not
met by November 15. Some of
the demands included: an in-
crease in black student enroll-
ment to “at least one hundred
fifty within two years,” a black
or African studies program, and
several black faculty members,
plus a greater role in Davidson’s
social life and more blacks in
the college administration. The
deadline followed a meeting
with the faculty executive com-
mittee.

There were a total of ten
proposals given to President
Samuel R. Spencer in April of
the preceeding academic year.
Ron Gibson, President of the
Black Student’ Coalition, said
that little had been done since

April to implement the plan. .

Because of this lack of action,
the BSC set a deadline for the
meeting of these demands.
Some black students are con-
vinced that Davidson will not be
able to recruit prospective black
students without their help.

‘A resolution by the SGA
Senate called for the self-

scheduling of exams, and SGA
Vice-President Bo Phillips
claims that this will cut down on
the amount of paperwork during
exams for both professors and
students. The only change from
the current system would be to
have all of the exams at the dis-
posal of all of the students dur-
ing each of the eight examina-
tion periods, rather than the stu-
dents scheduling through the
Registrar’s Office particular
exams they plan to take on par-
ticular - days. When queries
arose regarding increased con-
fusion of having all of the
exams available, Phillips said,
“it would really not be that
much more difficult. All we’d
have to do would be to double
the tables (on which the exams
are set out) and the number of
people handling them.

The faculty approved the.

amended semester proposal in a
60-33 vote in a meeting on Oc-
tober 19. The revised proposal
includes the thirty-six credit
graduation requirement, a ‘stan-
dard teaching load of six
courses per annum, and six
credits for those participating in
the Humanities program. SGA
President Tim Johnston claims
that the proposal will overbur-
den science majors: “lab
courses would not be on a fair

on strike

parallel” with other schools, he
said, and he proposed an
amendment which would make
all science courses numbered
higher than 21 worth 1.5 cred-
its. The Biology department ad-
mitted that while the change
would require a lot of revision,
the, rethinking of its program
might be very worthwhile. The
Chemistry department agreed
that much revision would be
needed, but was skeptical of the
positive benefits of a semester
system. Others have recom-
mended a credit-hours system
for semesters, and the SGA has
appointed a committee to study
the credit-hours proposal.

“Erik Christensen is running
as the Libertarian candidate for
the U.S. House of Representa-
tives in the 6th congressional
district of North Carolina,
which includes Alamance;
Guilford, and Davidson coun-
ties. Christensen stated that, “I
don’t really think I’d win,
though I’d be pleased if I
did. . . I’m not really running
to get elected as much as to let
people know about the Liberta-
rian party. The Libertarian plat-
form advocates “‘a truly free-
market economy, draft aboli-
tion, nuclear arms reduction, an
immediate forty percent tax cut
and a seventy pércent military
spending decrease,” according
to Christensen.

Friday, October 16, 1987 THE DAVIDSONIAN

What's the matter with
Davidson after 150 years

By GLENN FOGLE and
ASH AHSANNUDIN

The MacLads could not find
anything at all worth mentioning
about Davidson’s sesquicenten-
nial homecoming weekend.

Question of the week (inspired
by the “Opinions” article “Some-
thing is Rotten at Davidson” in
this term’s first Davidsonian’
issue): |

What’s the matter with David-
son College after 150 years of
existence?

A. The mini skirt is back in
vogue save at Davidson where the
rubens look is still in. Note: some
feminists argue that mini_ skirts
have been reintroduced to the
fashion world by male chauvinists
[some would even include Cap-
tain Pike Dog] as a sexist tool to
keep women in their place as sex
objects. We agree.

B. Bob the Carrot.

C. The hard-charging §Air-
borne Ranger ROTC Cadet Corps
have recently ordered a complete
set of camouflaged skirts and
blouses for their new commander.

D. Wompus the campus dog
has disappeared,

E. We elected a bovine (moo-
cow for you lay-people) as
Homecoming Queen.

F. The football team, sensing
that they might actually win the
Homecoming game ‘and cause
wide-spread panic and heart fail-
ure among fellow students and
alumni, came out in the third quar-
ter and lost in true Davidson spirit.

G. The Davidson spirit.
H. Absolutely nothing. | +

If you know the answer to this
one, think about it for the rest of:
your college career.

Eating disorders |
can be controlled

Dear Confidential Health,
_,_, Uhaven’t been able to, admit
this to anyone. I have a real prob-
- em with food and I feel out of
control lately. I’m constantly
wreoccupied by food and by my
' weight. I may be “bulemic,” but I
1ate that;word. Is there any help
or someone like me? I keep
wromising myself I’m never going
o do this again, but it never
vorks.
Sincerely,
A Davidson Sophomore

Dear Sophomore,

Confidential Health is pleased
that you wrote in with this prob-
lem. Some studies have estimated
that anywhere from ten to twenty
‘percent of college women have a

center here on campus. provides
individual counseling sessions
which are confidential and free to
Davidson students. _ Virginia
SyKes and Campbell Peery are
two counselors who have experi-
ence in your area of concern.
There is also a support group
which meets every Monday night
from. 6:30 to 7:30 in 301 Cham-
bers. This is run by Georgia
Ringle, a health educator on cam-
pus.

The problem of binging is usu-
ally more common in females,
teenagers, and older people who
are achievement-oriented, highly
_motivated and who tend to ‘come
from middle- and upper-income
backgrounds. 5

Most women start this. be-
havior in an attempt to lose
weight. They think they would
look better if they lost 2-3 or 5-6
pounds but generally they are al-
ready within a-normal weight
range. Binging and purging in the

~fong run usually leads to a weight

similar problem. The counseling -

gain. oe
Eating ots of food when you
are not necessarily hungry can be
a symptom that something is not
right in your life. Emotional states
of depression or loneliness tend to
trigger eating, not always related
to hunger. Binging becomes an
anxiety-reducer, a tranquilizer.
This is why people need to seek
outside help. It is more than just a
problem with food.

A great deal of our culture has
taught women that to be success-.
ful she must be gorgeous, skinny,
have.a great husband, many male
admirers, wonderful children, and
be Chairman of the Board. This is
an immense, unrealistic pressure.
Blindly striving to become this
“ideal” woman can lead to unheal-
thy habits, and binging is one of
them. ee

People who binge or starve
themselves need help in recover-
ing not only their normal eating |
habits but in gaining a better per-
spective on their self-image, con-
fidence and self-esteem. In addi-
tion, there can be serious physical
effects if this behavior goes on for
a prolonged period of time. A
combination of individual coun-
seling, nutritional information,
and a suppoort group may all
prove helpful.

As you can tell, this is a diffi-
cult problem to handle by ‘your-
self. The most important and
sometimes hardest thing to do is to
tell someone. Your success in
treatment will depend on your
own personal motivation. There is
help on campus, and. the-sooner
treatment is sought, the better you
will feel.
