Many loyal and enthusiastic DKs
were seen early last Friday morn-
ing out to cheer the big team off
to the William, and Mary game.
Conspicuously “absent avas. Morph-
eus Morris — however, he redeem-
ed himself by standing at atten-
tion beside the bed while Dixie was
played — then he crawled back in-
to the sack.

Brothers Williams, Dietrick;
Goodman, Fesperman and Richakd
composed a good section of the
cheering section at the Norfolk
game. Goodman's date was cheer-
ing for W. and M. and from the
reports concerning her ability to,
talk, for the first time in his life,
he couldn't be heard. He has been
frustrated ever since.

DKs initial venture onto the in-
tramtral field resulted in a com-
plete victory — for the Kappa Al-
phas. That's all right, though, our
team is red hot (from trying to
catch the other team) and we ex-
pect to see a great improvement in
the games to follow. Notable per-
formances were turned in by Pledg-
es Alcorn, Beck, and Morton, while
Carr, Clark and

Butt gave a good account of them-

selves also.
