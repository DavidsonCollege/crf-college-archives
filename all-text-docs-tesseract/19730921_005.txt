LETTER TO THE EDITOR

A Koloditch Protests
Early Closing Hour

To the Editor:

One night last week, having
some late night studying to do,
I made my way to the Honors
College, as I have been ac-
customed to doing in situations
such as these. To my infinite
dismay, I discovered that the
door was locked.

Being somewhat’ won-
dersome,, the next day I made
it a point to find out why my
nocturnal sanctuary had not
been open the night before. You
can imagine my chagrin at fin-
ding out that it was no longer to
be open after midnight.

As far as I know, the Honors
College is the only place to

*Vindictive’ Journalists Deserve Acclaim

Now is the time, after
Watergate Summer, for we of
the college press to praise our
elders working for the major
American newspapers. For the
scandal which destroyed many,
also vindicated the media of
this country.

Almost from the outset, the
current administration has
sought to undermine the press.
Nixon seems to look upon the
news conference with scorn,
and both he and Mr. Agnew
have not hesitated in the past to
lash out at newsmen or
correspondents with whom they
disagreed. The Vice President’s
comments on the press made
early in the first term are now
notorious.

Of course we have recently
learned that top newsmen were
also subjected to wiretaps and
given high rankings on White

House enemies lists. The Ad-
ministration deliberately
established an adversary
relationship.

But fortunately, none of this
kept the reporters from their
task as the Watergate story
developed. It was largely due to
their efforts that the truth even-
tually surfaced. Within days af-
ter the burglary took place the
cover-up began to unravel, and
although much was _ not
revealed until months later, the
press never forgot about
Watergate.

Perhaps the best that has
been said about the media, the
Washington Post in particular,
in this regard, was the
statement Clark MacGregor
made in October of last year:
“Using innuendo, third-person
hearsay, unsubstantiated
charges, anonymous sources

and huge scare headlines, the
Post has maliciously sought to
give the appearance of a direct
connection between the White
House and the Watergate, a
charge which the Post knows--
and a half a dozen _ in-
vestigations have found--to be
false.’’ One wonders how
malicious that newspaper
really was.

Still criticism of the media
has not ended. As recently as
this June, William Rees-Mogg,
editor of the prestigious Times
of London questioned the way
the American press has handled
the Watergate scandal. Mr.
Nixon, he maintained, is being
subjected to the good old
American “lynch law.’’ Both
trial and conviction are being
carried out in newspapers
which depend largely on leaks,
for their information.

Rees-Mogg needs to remem-
ber, though, that the press
depends on leaks simply
because it is witnessing the
crumbling of a massive cover-
up. The newspapers would like
to have the full story im-
mediately, but there are others
who are trying to keep the facts
of the case hidden.

It has often been a question of
having a part of the truth or
none of the truth. Interestingly
enough, very few of the ‘‘scare”’
headlines have been proven
false.

Obviously Watergate repor-
ting has enhanced the
credibility of the press. If
Americans read future ‘“‘horror
stories” with reluctance, it
will not be because they be-
lieve they are lies, but because
ey are afraid they are the
truth.

study late as night in a pleasant
atmosphere.

There is one’s dorm, but I
cannot get any serious studying
done there even if my room-
mate is asleep.

Then, too, there are those of
us who are light sleepers and
who are bothered by light in the
room.

There are the lounges, but
they are not conducive to
studying either.

It seems to me _ not
unreasonable to inquire as to
why the Honors College has
been closed to the night-owls of
Davidson.

Is it that certain articles are
being stolen? Are chairs and
sofas being torn apart?

The Honors College building
is maintained so that it might be
of use to the Davidson com-
munity, is it not? Why, then,
must students’ be __in-
convenienced and be forced to
find another suitable study
area.

I would hope that whoever
made the decision to close the
Honors College __reconsiders
that decision.

I don’t think it is too much to
ask to make it convenient for
students to study.

‘Woodlands and fields of the rolling
Piedmont countryside stretch out
around the 80-acre main campus. Its
100 acre lake campus, three miles
distant, offers swimming and boating.
The 1,000 men students pursue studies
in a broad range of liberal-arts courses.
About a quarter of them are in an
especially strong pre-med program.
Some 70 percent of graduates continue
for advanced degrees. Pillared,
Classical Revival architecture prevails

TOWN AND COUNTRY, August, 1973

ize the place? Well, it’s our
beloved alma mater. It was listed in
“Town and Country”’ as one of the “50
Top Alternative Colleges” to Harvard,
Yale and Princeton.

I must confess I am not in the habit of
reading T&C for aesthetic and
budgetary reasons, and in fact the
August issue was the first I have ever
read.

However a friend recommended |
read this particular issue for laughs
sinceitslead story was ‘‘Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, -- How to Get Accepted at
the Big Three.”

In Boston and environs, where I spent
the summer, it is evidently a matter of
some concern whether or not one gets
into the “Big Three.” But since 1 was
not part of that milieu, I could chuckle
at the pretentions of the bourgeots.

My levity dimmed somewhat when I
got “to the section about Davidson

because I could not believe that my con-
ception of Davidson was so different
from T&C’s. However I shrugged it off
as T&C’s misinterpretation of in-
formation given to it by the Admissions
Department.

So it was with some disbelief that I
read parts of the 1973-74 College
Catalog and an arresting little pam-
phiet entitled ‘Why Choose Davidson?”
Many of us seniors have increasingly
been asking ourselves this question in
recent days as we scurry about trying
to get into graduate school.

Actually we should have nothing to
fear because, depending on what
college publication one _ reads,
“Traditionally, about 75 percent of each
graduating class pursues study in
business and_ the professions, prin-
cipally at the finest (sic) graduate
schools in the eastern half of the United
States” (College Catalog), or ‘‘About 70
percent of them later attend graduate
or professional schools.”’

All should take time to peruse ‘“‘Why
Choose Davidson?”’ It is fair to say one
would find the official view of Davidson
somewhat at odds with the typical
student's view of things.

Of course there are homilies such as,
“Our main concern is not quantity but
quality."’ The theme of the pamphlet is
that Davidson is ‘‘sui generis.”’

But in an effort to demonstrate
Davidson's uniqueness, this slick little
publication stoops to the half truth and
disingenuousness which have come to
characterize the military-industrial-

university
Watergate.

It touts Extended Studies which‘‘lets
you design an experimental learning
project, guided by a sponsoring
professor.”’

Well, the truth of the matter is that
most of the faculty, in keeping with
their hallowed policy of emphasizing
the mundane, have done everthing in
their power to sabotage this noble en-
deavor from its inception.

Under the heading ‘You can learn in
many different ways,’’ there is the
traditional hoopla about the op-
portunities of studying abroad.

Those who out-argued their faculty
advisors or changed their majors (an
education at anyplace other than
Davidson is always inferior) in order to
study in France, Germany or
wherever last year have begun that an-
nual indignity of going from professor
to professor begging for course credit
for the work (inferior) that they did
abroad. :.

Under the heading ‘‘People at David-
son care about other people” we learn
that ‘‘Professor Jones talks till mid-
night ‘with a troubled freshman.’’ Who
is this Professor Jones?

complex in this Age of

Is he the same professor-advisor
(father) who looks up from his desk and
says, ‘‘Who are you?’’ when you come
to his office to get his approval to take
courses for the winter term of your
freshman year?

One also learns that “‘because we

words in length.

have good applicants to begin with, we
accept about 60 percent of those who ap-
ply.’’ According to the 1972 edition of
“The Comparative Guide to American
Colleges” Davidson in 1971 accepted
only 43 percent of its applicants.

Does this mean that the quality of ap-

phenomenal i

plicants has shown im-
provement? At least by one criterion,
rank in high school class, it does not.

The Admissions office reported in
1971 that 95 percent of the entering
freshmen were in the top fifth of their
graduating classes whereas the figure
for 1972 is 84 percent.

Let’s approach the statistics game
from a different angle. Davidson, for
some now forgotten reason, is’
sometimes called by the uninformed
“The Princeton of the South.” (1
believe that Virginia also has this ap-
nat detain i ee
“Princeton : University of Virginia
of the North’’?) 7

At any rate Princeton accepts only 20
percent of its applicants, so to use the
Alumni Office’s reasoning, are we to
conclude that Princeton accepts such a
small percentage because the great
majority of its applicants are so lacking
in intellectual abilities?

Suspension of belief applies only to
art, and if we look at a college more in
Davidson’s ball park, W; and
Lee, we discover that it accepts 61 per-
cent of its applicants. Why have aaa.
Southern colleges been so inundated
with such “good applicants’?
