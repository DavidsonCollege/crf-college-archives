Cross Country Weathers UNCC Invitational

By RAND HARTSELL

As many of you may recall, the wea-
ther last weekend was nothing like a
balmy, pleasant Indian summer day. But
for most runners... “Ah, give me a
cool rainy day!”

Collectively, the Wildcat cross-coun-
try team ran their fastest performance of
the year at the UNCC Invitational on
Saturday, October 22.

Brevard’s Alphonse Swai capitalized
on what appeared to be perfect condi-
tions for him, blazing the nearly all flat
5.15 mile course in 24 minutes, 21 sec-
onds, a torrid pace of 4:43 per mile. In-
deed Swai’s only challenge of the day
was at the starting line. His nearest pur-
suer came through the finish chute 55
seconds behind him.

Davidson’s Frank Ivey followed in
hot pursuit of Swai, but by 1/2 mile the
Brevard runner had already established a
20 meter gap between himself and Ivey
and Wake Forest’s David Crowe. Crowe
and Ivey later fell back to fourth and sixth
places overall.

Other Brevard runners placed sec-
ond, third, fifth, and seventh, scoring an
impressive 18 points to runner-up
Wake’s 73. Clearly, the team race was

for second place as host UNCC slipped
by the ’Cats for third place with a score of
84 to 89.

As the runners poured across the
finish line many Wildcat harriers reacted
in much the same way. “Everything
clicked,” beamed Bob Watkins; Bryan
Zielinski echoed that same comment.
Both runners recorded P.R.’s (personal
records) for five miles.

Predictably, the "Cats order of finish
was unpredictable. The sixth time in as

many meets, the top seven shuffled
themselves around to finish in yet
another sequence. Following Ivey came
Trey Jammes, Greg Foreman, Zielinski,
Frank Hague, Watkins and Jim Rogers.
With this new order of finish the
*Cats recorded one of their lowest top
seven spreads (2:09) of the year. Al-
though the ’Cats lost to three teams (two
by narrow margins), they easily defeated
the six other participating schools: USC-
Spartanburg, Virginia Commonwealth,

Old Dominion, J.C. Smith, Winston-
Salem State and Radford.

The ’Cats are idle tomorrow as they
prepare for the Southern Conference
Championship to be held at Appalachian
State’s course on Saturday, November 5.
ASU’s course is in Blowing Rock, a
mountain town noted for its unpredicta-
ble, often inclimate weather. If last
Saturday is any indication of the ‘Cats
preferred running climate, thing's could
look bright on a cloudy day.

Field Hockey Clips Sweet Briar 2-1

By KARA GILMORE

The women’s field hockey team had
a lesson in overcoming adversity last
weekend. They had to deal with changed
travel plans, long van rides, horrible
fields, and inclement weather. They
came sloshing through it all with a 2-1
victory over Sweet Briar College.

Sweet Briar came out quickly and
scored early before Davidson had had
time to get settled on the unfamiliar field.
The Ladycats grouped up after the goal
and fired themselves up to come back.

They took control of the ball and the flow
of the game and had the Sweet Briar de-
fense on the run. Finally on a scramble in
front of the goal after a penalty corner,
senior left wing Stephanie Bensinger put
one past the Sweet Briar goalie. The goal
tied the game at | and it stayed that way
through halftime.

The entire second half was played in
a steady rain which began. during
halftime, but the Ladycats bore down
and kept attacking. Finally with only
about five minutes remaining in the game

Davidson scored again. Right wing
Suzie Klineman barely saved the ball be-
fore it went out over the end line then sent
a beautiful centering pass across the front
of the goal, Inner Mavin Martin was
positioned perfectly in front of the cage
and deflected the pass right past the
goalie for the winning score.

This win left the Ladycats with a re-
cord of 5-3-] at the end of their regular
season. This weekend they will travel to
Appalachian State to play the season
finale — The Deep South Tournament.
