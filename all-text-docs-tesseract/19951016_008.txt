Where is the support?

Katie

I need support. So do most
women. I’m not talking about

emotional issues here, I’m talking
about pure physical help; I’ m talk-
ing about sports bras. I need them
and not enough sports stores sell
them. :

Now, let’s all agree on some-
thing right off the bat: most women
who participate in any sports-re-
lated activity need a sports bra.
This assumption does recognize
that there are those lucky women
who do not require such apparati. I
simply am pointing out the fact
that an overwhelming majority of
women need to purchase one or
more sports bras if they engage in
a sport at any level. Are we all
together on this? Good.

Herein lies the problem. Do
sports stores sell this necessary
piece of equipment for women?
The answer: not enough stores
carry sports bras. I discovered this
in my own quest for a sports bra.
Enraged by my inability to find
this crucial piece of attire at two
area sports stores (one being a na-
tional chain), I decided to launch a

’ full scale investigation of the mat-

ter.

My method: I called every
sporting goods store in the Char-
lotte phone book which sold sport-
ing apparel. Theresult: nine stores
sold sports bras and nine didn’t.
However, if the three women’s
specialty sports stores are removed
from the sample so that only gen-

"MELROSE IS ON

HE GOOD MING ABOUT
“MELROSE PLACE.

Jack the
‘prediction boy

Homecoming was this week-
end, but by the time this paper is
out the event will be over. All the
fun will have been had, all the
alumni will have gone back to work
or graduate school, or, in some
cases, unemployment, and all the
students (well, some of them any-
way) will have returned to the li-
brary. :
So here are my predictions
made ahead of time. Let’s see if
I’m right.

Davidson football loses a heart
breaker 21 to 20.

Some freshmen gets a little too
tipsy and passes out face down in
the middle of the court.

My roommate, Jefe, never gets a
date, but hooks up with an alum.
Dean Terry comes back with a full
head of hair.

Another damn hurricane forms in
the Atlantic, and, as usual, just as

Friday night rolls around the clear .

skies turn into absolute. junk, and
we get rained on all weekend.
Some junior guy from Tennessee
runs around naked in the court.
Whole lotta hangovers happeuin’
Sunday morning.
Long shot prediction: some alum
gets into a wrestling match with
Officer Moore (alias, Terminator
X) over a wristband dispute, alum
wins with by launching a devastat-
ing clothesline from the Sig Ep
tree.
The whole staff at the Davidsonian
gets wasted both nights and doesn’t
have time to edit this article—the
only reasonable explanation for
why it would be published.
My roommate, the slack, lazy Opin-
ions editor, adds at least one de-
rogatory statement about me into
my article.
Jack is a tool.

Well, that’s about it. Hope
you all had a fun weekend.

eral sporting goods stores remain,
six sold sports bras and nine didn’t.
So, when I walk into a general
sports store there is a 66% chance
my needs as a woman will be met
and 33% chance they won’t.
That just doesn’t cut the mus-
tard. The message the general
stores are sending is that, in fact,
they are not general but male stores.
Perhaps they should say that in
their name so I won’t even have to
go there. I will just stick to the
three women’s stores where they
acknowledge the special support I
need! ee
Guys, you may not understand
the gravity of such a bra shortage
in the Charlotte sports market. Let
me explain. Whatif only one-third

of the stores sold something you
had to have just to play basketball

or flickerball for over 10 minutes?°

Men have their own support needs,
as I understand it, but they don’t
need such contraptions for a
friendly game of tennis. Women,
unless they enjoy pain, do.
Furthermore, back tothe sports
stores, I would like to note that two
of the store employees with whom
I spoke (both male) laughed at my
request for a sports bra. What is
that? One other man responded to
my inquiry by saying, “I carry a
jog bra type halter top type aerobic
wear thing.” I was a bit confused
but grouped his’store with those
that did carry sports bras. But who
knows? What was he really talk-

ing about? Did he know what a
sports bra was? This example defi-
nitely shows a need for more sports
bra awareness. :

Fellow women bra wearers
(and male “bro” wearers too) it’s
time to use our consumer power to
get these “jog bra type halter top
type aerobic wear things” into the
stores! Join me in protest by
donning your sports bras and de-
manding stores tailor their mer-
chandise to suit our-bra needs! (I'll
know you’re in on the crusade by
the telltale “uniboob” effect all
sports bras have.)

The time has come for no less
than a sports bra revolution! We
must Overcome such support defi-
ciencies!

Ten steps
to perfection

This place needs some serious
work. A couple years ago I was in
love with Davidson and thought
our fine liberal arts school consti-
tuted perfection in the sphere of
colleges. Ahhhhhh, the naivete.

Now that I am a wise and
seasoned senior, I can clearly see
the many deficiencies plaguing our
institution. Don’t get me wrong, I
still think Davidson is great, but
it’s cool to complain about your
school, so I’m going to jump on
that band wagon. Actually, I think
I'll take a more constructive ap-
proach and make a few sugges-
tions that could greatly improve
our campus.

First, shoot the people in
charge of the college directory.
Who the hell are these delinquents?
Hello, it’s mid-October, and there
is no directory in sight. The people
at the Union desk all want to kill
me because I call about 25 times a
day asking for numbers. Get off
your butt, directory people, let’s
see some action.

.Second, we need a monorail
from the senior apartments to
Chambers. That walk is ridicu-
lous. As I am in such fine physical
condition, I work up a sweat every
day walking to class. This will not
do. I’m thinking of a nice modern
electric train like they have at
Disney World. Maybe serve cock-
tails in the afternoon and donuts in
the morning. It could work.

Third, cut off the drugs to the
RLO workers.. What do these
people do all day? A work order
my apartment put in before school
even started just got taken care of
last week. Last year we complained
about a broken air conditioning in
late September, and RLO rolled in
around early April. I’m sure Kurt

Holmes is in the process of whip-

ping the staff into shape as we
speak, but please, do something.

Fourth, put cable in the dorm
rooms. I don’t really care a whole
lot about this one because I live in
the cable-blessed senior apart-
ments, but I figure I should kiss up
to the younger people so I’! have a
place to stay during next year’s
homecoming. So let them have
cable. T.V. is fun, educational,
and it’s the backbone of every .de-
cent society on earth. Don’t be
archaic, let’s get some cable going
in the rooms.

Fifth, more random naked-
ness. This needs no explanation.
Guys, please, ignore this one.

Sixth, no more speed bumps.
Speed bumps are annoying. Pe-
destrians be damned--if we want
to haul butt in our cars we should
have that option. Maybe put a
guard rail around Patterson Court
to prevent. drunks stumbling into
oncoming traffic. Other than that I
think walkers can fend for them-
selves. We could go into the pros
and cons of speed bumps, but it
still won't change the fact that 10
out of 10 motorists preferno bumps
in the road. Plus they're yellow
and ugly, a major eye soar in the
midst of our beautiful arborarium
of acampus. One of the executive
editors here, Mandy Curtis, has a
new car and she especially hates
speed bumps. That should be rea-
son enough. You must keep the
media Happy.

Seventh, pay the staff at the
Davidsonian. \f we offered a little
monetary incentive, slackers such
as myself probably wouldn't slip
through the cracks, and the Opin-
ions section might actually be in-
teresting.

Eighth, there should be a break
during the world series. Anyone

who is not a communist will either
be glued to their T.V. set or road
tripping to the games, so why bur-
den these fine young sports fans
with school work. Anyone who
knows baseball also knows that
the sport is a metaphor for life.
Ahhhh, the cyclical pattern of the
game, the lone individual striking
out against adversity, man against
ball and nine other men, the spirit
of the adventurer longing to launch
his aspiratious into the wild blue
yonder. Or you could view it as the
relentless pursuit of material wealth
by greedy men bent only on attain-
ing more money. Either way it's
the American dream. It's our na-
tional pastime. So when the Braves
take the field this week against one
of those loser American League
teams, back off on the school thing.

Ninth, for God sakes, do some-
thing about those banner messages.
Could they be any longer?

Tenth, I think the word
"hoochie" should be brought into
everyday conversation. I realize I
may offend a few women with this
one, but allow me to explain.
"Hoochie" need not represent
women. Wecouldchange its mean-
ing to describe butter, or beer guts,
or that smell emerging from my
apartment every Saturday and Sun-
day morning. You see, "hoochie"
just rolls off the tongue so
smoothly. It's a snappy word that
always juices up a conversation
and makes everyone happy. En-
glish types, I'm giving you the ini-
tiative on this one. Come up with
something good.

Well, that’s it for now. Mull
these suggestions over and Ill get
backto you soon. Food for thought,
chew it like grizzle: Remember, if
we all work together this can be a
better place for everyone.
