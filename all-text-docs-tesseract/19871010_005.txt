Spoof O' The Week ;
Scammin’ and Snakin’: spoofs extraordinaire

By BILL SCOUTEN

Homecoming weekend -- Let’s
hit the Court! It’s the weekend that
we've all been wailing for, antici-
pating the guarantee of fun,
friends, and a football victory (7).
Hurray! I don’t know about you,
but I’m really looking forward to
seeing old friends, losing my voice
at the football game, perhaps en-
joying the Doc Watson concert,
and attending the cocktail parties
bn the Court with my...Oh! I for-
got. I’ve got to find a date!
Agh!@#$ IhopeI’mnottoo late.
“So many beautiful’ women and so
little time.” (All right, it’s not
creative..John Barrymore said
that.) I better get going!

You need not tell me about your
problems. But it’s not too late. We
all know that you've been “scam-
ming” on that girl or guy out there...
thecute one, the beautiful one, the
one with whom you'll never get a
date. What have you got to lose?
At ground zero there is nowhere to
go, but up. Everyone is allowed to
have a go at it.

It doesn’t matter that you’re shy.
This same problem is faced by
many each year. So, stop feeling
sorry for yourself! Sit down in the
easy Chair next to the phone and
gather around you the Wildcat
Handbooks of years 1985-1987.
Now, leaf through the handbooks
in search of the perfect date. Re-
ally, it’s easy!

Come on, stop thinking that
she’ll never consider going with
you or that he doesn’t really like
you. Pick up the phone, sound
desirous, and above all, don't let.
your voice crack. Don’t be dis-
couraged, It may take from three to

six choices before the right combi-
nation is found.

‘It’s nine o’clock at night, you’re
sweating, you're nervous; it’s got
to be this one. She’s cute, she has
a great personality, she would bea
great date!

“Hello ----- , this is -----. Iknow
it’s late, but I’m calling to ask...ask
if you are going to be around this
weekend -- at Homecoming’...
Yea, I’m going to behere, too. Do
you have a date to any of the
events...I’d love to take youif you
haven’t!... Great! Do you like foot-
ball? What kind of food do you
like? Would you like to go toa
party on the court?... Okay, I’Il talk
to you tomorrow.”

Yes, you did it. You've gotten a
date. You’reelated. Relax! Take
big, deep breaths because now that
you’ ve got a date you must worry
about several common Homecom-
ing weekend scenarios. Right off
hand, three spoof scenarios come
to mind as definite possibilities:
(1) Beware of being “stood up”; (2)
Beware of “grovelling” in public;
and (3) Beware of “snaking” on
some other person’s date.

Your first worry: don’t get
“stood up” by your date. This is
possibly one of the most embar-
Tassing pre-date disasters known to
man. You’re all dressed up, smell-
ing nice, hair combed -- you look
Marvelous! Perfect. You walk to
your date’s room, knock loudly on
the door...no-answer. This is outra-
geous! Did you brush your teeth?
My advice: Follow up on your
phone calls. Make sure that your
“date” knows who you are. Avoid
the spoof.

You picked up your date? Allis

well? Great! But the night is still
young. After a winning day of
football (?), music, and cocktails,
it’s dinner time. Nakato’s (an all
time favorite) or McDonald’s (Jim
Walker's alleged favorite) sounds
great. The food is good, atmos-
phere is good, and your date is
looking really good! Back to
Davidson you go. Drink a little,
perhaps too much. Now that date is
looking better than you ever
thought he/she would...No boy!!
Don’t do it!!! Don’t grovel in pub-
lic! (“Grovelling,” for those who
wonder, is a term used to represent
what students know as “necking”

and “fooling around.”) Exhibition-
ism is just out of the question.
The final scenario deals not with
the logistics of a date, but with
simple date etiquette. In short
order, don’t “snake” on someone
else’s date. (“Snaking” is a term
used to refer to the action of flirting
to the point of actually drooling
over another person’s date.) This is
just unacceptable for tworeasons:
(1) Your date is going tohate you;
and (2) The other person’s date is
going to hate you. What a bad
scene! The solution is simple:
You’ve asked this a person to be
your date, so treat them as your

date. (Drool internally!)
Well, there you have it. The
perfect “spoofless” Homecoming
Weekend. I don’t know why
you're sitting there reading my
article, though. Yea! You without
a date! Get with it, get cracking
those handbooks. You'll find a
date. There are many out there...I
promise!
Editor's note: Mr. Scouten didnot
find a date using these methods. He
called what we refer to as “escort
services.” The last we heard is
that all had turned him down so
far. Let's just keep the record
straight, shall we, Bill?

Pop Film: “Song of the South”’

By JENNIFER HOFFMAN

Picture the perfect southern plan-
tation, complete with white col-
umns, shady oaks, and Hattie
McDaniel (Scarlett’s “Mammy” in
“Gone with the Wind”), and sct it in
the state of Georgia, 1870.

Next, picture the colorful car-
toonland of Brer Rabbit and the
gang complete with briar patch, tar
baby, and a singing Mr. Bluebird,
and set it in your imagination, a
longtimeago. __

Link the two together with a
chubby black servant named Uncle
Remus (James Baskett), and you
have the setting for Walt Disney’s
1946 classic, “Song of the South.”

The plot, based on Joel Chandler
Harris’s Tales from Uncle Remus,
centers around a young boy staying
on his grandmother’s plantation
who befriends “‘the best story teller
in the whole United States of Geor-

gia.” The two worlds of reality and
imagination are skillfully ‘inter-
woven on screen as the actors
shake hands with the animated
animals, and the cartoon characters
run through the countryside, fol-
lowed by their actual shadows.

If you saw this movie as a child,
you'd be tempted to sing along to
the catchy, uplifting tunes. It’s that
kind of music.

Actually, it’s that kind of movie.

—--—.“Song of the South” captures the

magic of childhood and stresses the
importance of the family. In the
spirit of Aesop, each of the three
tales of Brer Rabbit and his escapes
from Brer Fox and Brer Bear relate
a moral lesson. The pattern is
always the same: Smart talking
Brer Rabbit gets himself into
trouble and is forced to “use his
head instead of his foots” in order
to free himself.

What this movie lacks in sub-
tlety, itmakes up in heartwarming
emotion. ,
It’s a film that’s refreshingly pre-
dictable. (And it’s rated “G,”
though Brer Fox and Brer Bear
throw in enough good clean vio-
lence tokeep it exciting!)

Despite the overly romantic set-
ting, the stereotypic characters,
and the sugarcoated morals, this
film creates one “zip-a-dee-doo-
dah” kind of a feelin’ fo’ sho’!

So amid the studying and party-
ing plans for this weekend, reserve
time to see “Song of the South” this
Saturday night at 11:30 in the 900
room, or this Sunday aftemoon
during a special showing at 2:00 in
the Big Screen Room. As Uncle
Remus says, “Everybody needs a
laughin’ place,” and this week’s
Pop. Film presentation at the Union
could be yours.

Food costs up, Football beats Guilford 35-22

By RUSSELL BOOKER

Fifteen years ago--
October 13, 1972 (LXII, 4)

A survey of freshmen concerning
their meals revealed a substantial
amount of dissatisfaction regard-
ing the expense of food for the
semester. The same survey indi-
cated, however, satisaction with
the eating facilities themselves and
the quality of the food served.
Students were alloted $2.51 per
diem in meal tickets, but a discrep-
ancy between alloted tickets and
food prices in the three eating
houses of Bailey, Richards, and
Rusk has sparked considerable
protest from the students. The
survey, a questionnaire independ-
ently compiled by four students,
indicated student approval of the
concept offered by the three
houses--but that food prices were

Davidson students rejected a
proposed change to the semester

tive vote of 77.2% compared to a
22.8% of students who voted. The

said that, “the freshmen were starv-

In an unrelated issue, students
were upset over the refusal of one
of the College’s notaries to stamp
documents required by many states
for the verification of absentée
ballots, Mrs. Joyce Fleagle, Assi

surprise and that it indicated that
students were “solidly against” a
