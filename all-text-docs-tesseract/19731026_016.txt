two years. The money was used
for research programs and to
buy animals and equipment.
Bevan cited the current
Rocky River project as one of
the best examples of a well-
planned and implemented
study. ‘‘The Babcock Foun-
dation is paying $4500 for it. The
work is already underway and
will continue into the summer,
when five students will be em-

ployed. It is an_ in-
terdepartmental effort.”
The area will be studied from

many different angles, ranging
from biological to political in-
fluences.

There are several other foun-
dations that support such en-
deavors. These include the
Social Sciences Research Coun-
cil and the American Council of
Learned Societies. Both of these

projects. Their grants come
from local groups and the
National Endowment of Arts.

up the difference between the

its art; if you write about it it’s
humanities.”’

Blood Drive Nets 218 Pints .

By TOM AINSWORTH
Contributing Editor

The ROTC Red Cross Blood
Drive conducted at the college
last Wednesday, netted 218 pin-
ts of blood, exactly the number
of units needed for Davidson to
meet its quota in the first of the
two blood campaigns.

Blood insurance is therefore
effective for every member of
the college community-facutly,
staff, and students- plus their
immediate families and
relatives.

Captain William DeVaughan,
assistant professor of military
science and organizer of the
drive on campus, praised the
“outstanding student attitude”’
at Davidson in helping the com-

munity achieve its quota.

“Students here give a damn
about their fellow man,”’ said
DeVaughan. ‘“‘Bob Norman, a
senior, did an excellent job of
publicity for the program, and
as student organizer, was at the
drive most of the day.”’

‘In addition, there were
around 30 students who assisted
in the project, and some 40
faculty and staff wives who
helped the nurses and took care
of the paperwork,”’ DeVaughan
added.

Even though the college
barely met its quota, the fact is
that a Red Cross regulation
Stating that blood cannot be
taken for more than six hours at

a time necessitated the rejec-
tion of about twenty would-be
donors.

‘The hours for the blood drive
were posted as going from 10
a.m. to4 p.m. which we thought
meant that the Red Cross would
close the doors at 4p.m.

“They closed them at 3:30
p.m. however, so that they
wouldn't take any more blood
past 4 p.m., "’ DeVaughan poin-
ted out.

The ROTC department plans
to set the hours for the Spring
blood drive from 11 a.m. to 4:30
p.m.

The Spring drive is ten-
tatively scheduled for Monday,
April 8, 1974.
