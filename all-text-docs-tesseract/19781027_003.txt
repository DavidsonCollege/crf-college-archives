SAT, GRE make money for-obscur

LAWRENCEVILLE,
(CPS)—Camouflaged in sie
gently cantilevered hills of Law-
renceville is Ome of the most
‘influential unknown corpora-
tions in America.

Critics like to characterize it
as an unchecked monopoly, a
gatekeeper, a cradle-to-grave
arbiter of: social mobility.

Forbes Magazine, after not-
ing the 370 acres of prime real
estate, the’ artificial pond, the
real ducks, the $3. million con-
ference center, thetasteful brick
buildings, the savvy invest-
ments, called it one of the
hottest little growth companies
around.

Information officer John
Smith calls it a very concerned
organization, with a lot of
integrity.

The IRS calls it non-profit.

Most Americans have little to
say about the Educational Test-
ing Service (ETS). They know it
only as a multiple choice test
that stands between them and
college, grad school, law school
and now more than 50 profes-
sions ranging from podiatrist to
CIA agent. Last year over a
million students took the ETS-
designed Scholastic Aptitude
Test (SAT). Another 800,000
sat down to one of a battery of
graduate exams. Countless
others, from pre-schoolers to
auto mechanics, were meas-
ured, assessed, and, say the
critics, judged by an ETS test.

These programs, plus grants
from government and the pri-
vate sector, netted ETS $70
million in 1977 with a profit
margin of about $1 million.

ETS, in short, is a very
successful non-profit company.
A rubber stamp?

“For too many students, the
decision to take a standardized
admission test creates a statis-
tical shadow which follows them
through life, often without their
knowledge or control,’’ says
Congressman Michael Harring-
ton (D-Mass).

Harrington has introduced a
‘‘Truth in, Testing’’ bill de-
signed to open standardized
testing to public scrutiny and
control. California recently
passed a similar bill, and one is
now pending before the New
York legislature.

This action comes 30 years
after the Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teach-
ing, the American Council: for
Education and the College
Board Entrance Examination
Board (CEEB) established ETS
as a separate entity chartered to
construct educational tests.

Of this triumvirate, CEEB
was and is the most important.
An umbrella organization re-
presenting over 2500 schools of
every character, it contracts
with ETS to provide admissions
tests. Despite their historical
tie, the relationship is supposed
to be purely contractual, with
CEEB acting as consumer be
tector.

“Not so,” says Nader resear-

cher Alan Nairns, “The college

board is a rubber stamp for

ETS, and therefore not accoun-:

table to the students who must
take and pay for the exams.”
“Historical’’-and ‘‘amicable”’
are the words ETS president
William Turnbull uses to des-
cribe the relationship. Ried
should also say profitable. Last
year CEEB ‘programs accoun-
ted for more than 42 percent of

ETS revenues.
gh,

“ETS is not a gatekeeper,’”’
he says, claiming that charge is

not only untrue, but a bad
metaphor. “ETS is a custom
gatemaker according to the
dictates of the person who
wants, the gate,-I do think it’s
important that someone other
than ETS tan those deci-
sions.’

Turnbull admits that ETS, as
the largest educational research
organization in,the country,
often conducts the studies that
validate its own test to clients
like CEEB, but he points to the
distinguished educators in-
volved in the CEEB-ETS rela-
tionship as proof that motives
are pure. ‘iy

“Do you think men of this
caliber would be involved in
anything like that?” asked John
Smith as we examined a list of
ETS trustees.

Historical friendliness aside,
it was revealed in 1974 that the
ETS-CEEB contract contained
two clauses forbidding both
parties from doing business
with any competitors. Lawyers
at the time said that this was
probably an illegal restraint of
trade, but pointed out that the
courts are reluctant to apply
antitrust law to areas involving

- @ducation.

Whatever the nature of the
relationship, their union has
produced one controversial

monument: the SAT. Object-:

ive, simple, practical, graded in
milliseconds, a quick study for
harried admissions officers, it
has become a rite of passage for
millions of students.

But what exactly does it test?

“The SAT only measures a
student’s developed ability in a
particular area at a given time,’
says Turnbull.

It’s the school’s fault

One-time Einstein’ collabora-
tor and longtime ETS gadfly
Banesh Hoffman disagrees:
“They reward superficiality, ig-
nore creativity and penalize the
person with a, subtle probing
mind.”’ Ralph Nader and Har-
rington echo Hofffman’s charge
that the tests ignore such vital
qualities as creativity, integrity
and maturity.

Turnbull agrees: ‘‘It’s not as
if there were an array of things
to test, and ETS chose only a
couple. We test only what we
know how to measure. He adds
that if the test has come to
influence the allocation of aca-
demic opportunity, then the
fault lies not with ETS, but
with the colleges.

Still, ETS is not. completely
blameless. While they hedge on
stating exactly what predictive
value the tests possess, they
wax poetic on their test’s rigor-
ous development.

Oscar K; Buros, who reviews
nearly 1500 tests in his Mental
Measurements Yearbook, des-

-cribes the SAT as “highly per-

fected—possibly _ reaching ‘the
pinnacle of the current state of
the art of psychometrics.”’ Is it
odd for people to assume that
such a technically-exquisite test
ought to have some predictive
value?

The question of prediction is
a sensitive one at ETS. Correl-
ation between test scores and
college grades is only .4. For
some reason men consistently
score higher than women, al-
though the latter have better
academic records coming into
the test. Ethnic groups score
lower than whites.

ETS studies have revealed
that there is a direct and
continuous correlation between
family income and SAT scores.
There is a standard error of
measurement of 30 points. Con-
sequently; the true score of a
person receiving a 600 lies
somewhere between 570 and
630.

Such revelations prompted

the ‘Truth in Testing”’ legisla-.

tion. Briefly, the bills would
require all testing firms to make
public all reliability and validity
studies; to publish a prominent

warning that the allegedly exact

score is only an approximation
to provide test applications
with a specific description of
what skills are being tested; ,to
publish all test questions after
30 days and to notify students
and schools of. any irregulari-
ties.
Top secret

Turnbull agrees with the
spirit of the legislation, but
claims that. ETS already fulfills
all the criteria except publishing
test questions. They could do
that, but the cost would have to
be passed.on to the student.

“‘None of our research is
classified,’’ he says, a claim
that both Nairns® and former
New York Magazine writer
Stephen Brill dispute. Both
recount the prevalence of the
top secret stamp at ETS.

Regarding ETS errors, Vice
President Robert Solomon has
testified before HEW’s Privacy
Commission that they were ‘‘to
the best of our experience’ no
problems.

Since then, 95 percent of the
takers of the November 5, 1977
GMAT were scored 9 or 10

polite to6 er The mistake was

discovered only several months -
after the scores had been mailed
out. At the time of discovery,
John High, associate program
director for the management
pina ealled it ‘‘avery_serious

. It was caught: quite b
aheesco:” 6

In July and October, two
different LSAT exams were
administered. ETS says the
exams were of equal difficulty,
and cannot explain why one
group did so much better than
the other. Law schools were not
informed that the tests were
different.

The tests are nationally ac-
cepted nonetheless. President
Turnbull agrees that certainly
“‘with more tests in use the
possibility of misuse increases.”
So what’s on the horizon? In
this decade, ETS has moved
increasingly away from acade-
mics and into testing “occupa-
‘tional competence.”’ They are

fact that one of the major
criteria for tenure, as stipulated
in the Code of Evaluation, is the
professor’s ability to teach.

Brown stated, ‘‘The students
may be in the only position to
effectively evaiuate teaching a-
bility.”

In response to Spencer’s se-

cond argument, Brown stressed
that the student committee
member, like the faculty mem-
ber, would be expected to
voluntarily withdraw in cases of
conflict of interest and insensi-

the main questions troubling
his defunct student staff:
Should they go back to work for
WDAV now that’s it’s a college

station? And should they try to

help establish a 100-watt stu-
dent station?

Last week, Thompson said he
hoped no former WDAV staf-
fers would go back to work.

Yesterday, he said everyone
on the staff is free to ‘‘use their
own judgment” and. that those
who decide to go back will have
his ‘‘blessings and endorse-
ments.”

Last week, he-said he would

‘oppose any attempt to set up a

campus station.

Yesterday, he told the small
crowd that he thinks the Trus-
tee decision may now be ‘“‘irre
versable” and “it appears we
will be pushing for a 100-watt

station.”

The SGA Senate indepen-
dently decided to set up a
committee to look into the
possibility of setting up a new
station, according to Brown.

Brown added the committee
will probably include two for-
mer WDAV staff members, two
other students; and two mem-
bers from the faculty or staff.

Seven faculty members be-

noted that each decision will
require a considerable amount
of time and effort.

Another aspect of the pro-
posed Tenure Committee war-

PAC is determining a course of
action in the event of conflicting
recommendations by the Tenure
Committee and the President.
