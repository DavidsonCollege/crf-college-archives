‘Cats Nip Spiders On Comeback Trail

Davidson Out To Even Slate At

Coaches are strange people.

So are sports writers. And when the two breeds get
together, you can expect some trying moments. From
the viewpoints of a sportswriter, coaches may be pigeon-
holed into several distinct categories on the basis of
their contributions to the world of journalism via the
sports columns.

The bane of the writer’s existence is the mentor
who wouldn't venture a guess on the outcome of a con-
test even if his team was playing Mrs. O’Grady’s Bridge
Club. “Well, I just can’t say. They might score more than
we do, but then it might be the other way around. It's
just the way the ball bounces.”

Then there’s the type that gets a Uttle flustered
when he finds out that his words will be preserved in
‘newsprint: “For the paper, huh? Well, yeah, :1 guess.
you can say if it rains tomorrow, we'll play a double-
header today.”

Some coaches must have a little book in which
they jot down every banquet sobriquet and post-game
comment they run across: “Well, as the immortal. Knute
Rockne put it, we went out there and did it for ol’ Slob-
bovitz.” ;

The most productive interview always comes from
the coach who has a jargon all of his own and doesn’t
mind using it. Casey Stengel is a prime example but
Coach George Tucker, swimming coach here last year,
was pretty good in his own right. An actual quote:

“Why, I wouldn’t of give us a snowball’s chance
against Georgia . . . we’ve got a helluva good team...
I got throwed in-the pool three times.”

The coaches :give us a fit, but we got to admit—if
it weren't for them, we’d be hard put to get the news
across.

Coach Dole maintains that a poor call on rather
routine play cost his Wildcats the game against the Cita-
del. Halfback Jerry Sheffield was defending against a
Citadel pass and was called for interference late in the
game. This put the Bulldogs in scoring position but the
staunch Davidson defense gave the ’Cats the ball on
downs. Then, at the most inopportune moment, a Shef-
field punt was smothered on the three-yard-line. The

Citadel scored the deciding touchdown on a short line

buck soon after--

Dole says that game films show that Sheffield was.

behind the intended receiver on the interference play
and making a play for the ball, not the player—an ob-
vious mistake in officiation.

“The best team we'll play all season”—Bill Dole.
That’s his quick description of the Richmond Spiders, who play host to Davidson

An important game for the
Wildcats, who hold a 1-2 record
after Saturday’s loss to The
Citadel, the match tomorrow
should break a @éadlock in the
continuing Spider-’Cat series.
As it stands each team has won
seven, lost seven, and tied one
against the other. The 1958
score was 27-22, Richmond...

Davidson's starting line-up

The last two weekends have
seen Davidson play its heart
out, only to be edged by Pres-
byterian (25-21) and by Citadel
the Wildecat's first Southern
Conference foe, (13-7).
,saturday in Charleston, S. C.,
the Cadets, held scoreless for
nearly three periods, eapital-
ized quickly on a couple of
Wildcat blunders to tally 13
points and a victory. A blocked
Davidson punt was recovered on
the Wildcat five, and, two plays
later, Cadet fullback Belton
Dykes scored. Then, just 58
seconds later, a Charlie Benson
pass fell into the hands of
guard Bill Johnson, who raced
35 yards for the touchdown.

The Wildcats, continually
driving into scoring range,
finally produced a touchdown
late in the fourth quarter when
halfback George Hart followed
his blockers for 13 yards and
the score.

With time running out, Da-
vidson powered to the Citadel
16. but lost control on downs.

in its opening home game.
The win evened the team’s
record at 1-1 after a 40 loss
to powerful North Carolina
last Friday.

Tom Bruns and Mike Laugh-
lin scored goals in the first half
to give the Wildcats a 2-0 lead
at the end of that period. Da-

test when Belmont Abbey be-

In the opening. loss to Caro-
lina, the Davidson team played
fense. Hawever. especially after
the loss of Johnson in the sec-

strong offensive punch.

After the Belmont game on
Wednesday Coach Paul Mar-

explained that much of the
