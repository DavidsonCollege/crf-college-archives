Music News

By Frank Barr

Before Christmas, a petition spon-
sered by Phi Mu Alpha was passed
through the student body. The peti
tion was a huge success in that the
concert series admission comes out
of the tuition. This may not sound
like a very large accomplishment
but it will mean a lot better concert
series on the campus. ¢

In a recent meeting of the Phi
Mu Alpha, G.P. Whitley was elected
president to replace Mel Winstead
who resigned several weeks ago.
Bob Freeman was elected to serve
as secretary in the absence of Har-
ry McLean who left school for the
armed service.

Plans are under way for the
opening of Phi hall each afternoon ~
for an hour or so before supper.
On Saturday and Sunday afternoons
we hope to make the records avail-
able for several hours. Some mem-
bers of Phi Mu Alpha will be on
hand whenever the records are made
available to the students,

The, members of the band are in
for a big treat at Converse on
March 23. The band will be the
guest of Converse College at sup-
per. That evening they will play
al concert as a climax to the Con-
verse Music Festival. After the con-
cert the fair ladies of Converse will
treat the band members at a dance
— a nice reward for their work.

On March 1, the band gave a
concert in Salisbury before a group
of high school students who had
been asked to Salisbusy as members
of the All-State Band. Later in the
spring, the band and glee club will
each make a concert tour. They will
be keeping up the reputation of pre-
vious Davidson organizations.

dents and faculty members will be-
come an acute problem before next
September,” said President Cunning-
ham. The suggestion of building
brick homes and additional dormi-
tory space is therefore before our
grounds and building committee and
finance committee at this time.”

In concluding this report, Presi-
dent Cunningham spoke of the pro-
minent place which religiows? life
occupies on the Davidson campus,
and referred to the ever-increasing
emphasis being placed upon Christ-
ian ideals. “At the heart of the
campus life in its every expressionn,
as well as in its outlook upon the
world, the Christian principle pause
dominate.”
