The Tao Comes to Davidson

The man and his poetry:
Dr. Gill Holland’s new book

By ALEx CRUMBLEY
Editor emeritus

When I started to review Gill
Holland’s latest offering The Tao
Comes to Davidson, I was tempted
to write as much about the man as
his poetry. This is not usually the
custom, or even good protocol in
writing a book review, but as I read
the book I realized that I could
indulge myself with a clear con-
science. The poems are so full of
the charm and wit we know to be
Dr. Holland, it would be foolish to
ignore the personality so visible on
campus as a means of describing
them.

If you don’t know Dr. Hol-
land, you should. He is the white-
bearded, rosy-cheeked, perennially
smiling English professor who tips
his hat to people as he walks across
campus and frequents the library
more than most librarians. His
laugh resounds from one end of
Chambers to the other, and he re-
fers to students only by last name.

Anyone who has had a class
with Dr. Holland knows at least
one new vocabulary word forever
after — “gobbet.” The man sits in
his desk in a circle with all the
other students, and, while discuss-
ing Wordsworth, Milton, or Li Po,
also discusses a deer that was seen
running down Main Street, a trip
his son took to Europe, or a Carl
Orff symphony. These bits of in-
teresting information, literary or
otherwise, he calls “gobbets,” and
they enrich the vocabulary of the
English student far beyond a list of
literary terms, authors, and titles.
An effective teaching style, and
his very own.

Poets struggle to find a dis-
tinct style to call their own. For
Holland, uniqueness seems to come
as naturally as engaging conversa-
tion. Ina word, many of the poems
in this collection can be called
gobbets. He writes about his sec-

ond dog Fritz, a New York City’

marathon, and the Miami riots. A
couple of titles might help to give
asense of the many paths Holland’s

mind can take at once: “Ode tothe
New Sports Complex Parking Lot
during a Big Snow in Red Clay
Country on the Semicentennial of
the Rape of Nanking after the Visit
of the Blue Crane.” Here’s an-
other: “Profound Gondola, or The
Band was Playing as the Titanic
Went Down, April 14, 1912: A
Political Allegory for ‘92, with
Echoes of a Visit to Harry’s Bar
Opposite the Old Paris Opera
House with Gill.” Enough said.

Holland has a knack for in-
ventive language and description.
Describing Davidson after a snow,
he writes, “If the moon is cheese,
red clay and creamed cheese is /
our pooked moonscape.” While
Holland’s vocabulary is challeng-
ing, even quirky at times, he also
takes some different risks, em-
ploying words unusual in their
sheer plainness. In “Sitting Up at
Night and Seeing a Mouse in the
Kitchen,” he describes a mouse as,
you guessed it, “mousy.”

As the book’s title suggests,
Holland celebrates his sense of
place at Davidson with several
poems about the college and its
environs. “An Old Soccer Prophet
Wakes Up In Mecklenburg Red
Clay, Fall 1992,” a spirited tribute
to Davidson’s championship soc-
cer season, “Dogwood Easter in

N.C.,” and “Remembering the One *

and Only C. Shaw Smith” are
among the poems about Davidson
places.and people.

It is hard to say that there’s
any one thing Holland is going for
in this collection. The themes and
devices he employs are as diverse
as his vocabulary. It is not a book
for the easily daunted — as some
of his more cryptic poems require
some serious digestion time be-
fore you can figure them out.

Also by Holland are
Pocahontas and the drunken waiter
and Keep an Eye on South Moun-
tain: Translations of Chinese Po-
etry. The Tao Comes to Davidson
is published by Charlotte’s
Briarpatch Press and is available
in the college bookstore.

A picture appeared in the February 20 issue of The
Davidsonian which implied that Alex Crumbley had
passed out from drinking imported beers. The caption
was meant as a joke and was not, in fact, true,

A quick gobbet from the mind of Holland.

Far and away my favorite poem in the book, “Sweet Basil in the Garden” is exemplary of the wit,
language, and hint of local color that make Holland’s book delightful. The poem is sits and it would
be a shame for anyone to miss it. So here it is.

Sweet Basil in the Garden

Dr. G— works the wife’s herb garden in a jock strap.
Wants to go naked he says, way out there on the edge of the woods,

but-might snap off daddy’s dewlaps with the garden shears.
There he goes now out of the college library

all dressed in an armful of seven-dayers.
Who says he’s not the surest prince around?

Old Dr. G— serves the deepest martini in town
and the missus calls him O Sweet Basil, my nuddling naturist.

I'm not sure to whom “Dr. G—” refers, but we can all browse through directories and try to figure
it out. Or could it stand for Gill? Hmmmm...
