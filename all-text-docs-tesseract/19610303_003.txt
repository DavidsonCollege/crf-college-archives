Lefty And Attitude Sum It Up

__ The basketball season officially ended last Saturday
night and speculation is in order. On paper, the 1960-61
season finds Davidson in a not untamitier position —
more defeats than victories, and last place in the South-
ern Conference.

And yet, a close analysis of the year indicates that
there was something unique about this one — something
that cannot be measured in games won and lost.

We tried to come up with an answer to this unique-
ness, and decided on two words that sum it up — Lefty
and attitude.

Coach Lefty Driesell came to Davidson College in the
fall with an outstanding high school coaching record.
He was described in Virginia coaching circles as “un-
beatable on his home court, and virtually the same else-
where.” His most outstanding recommendations were
his ability to teach a boy how to play basketball, and then
get him fired up for a game.

Despite all these assets, Driesell had two strikes
against him when he arrived. He was inheriting a team
that had won but five of 24 games a year ago. There
was a general indifference toward the sport existing
among players and students. Area basketball fans claim-
ed, “That poor guy is gonna get knocked off his cloud
when he sees his material.”

But Driesell saw his material, began rounding it into
shape, and stayed on his cloud. He spoke of Davidson’s
possibilities of being the next conference champion. He
talked of national rating. He talked about the time when
“people will flock down here to watch us play, instead
of Duke or @arolina.”” And the skeptics smiled.

On the day before the season’s opener, the rookie
mentor told a newspaperman, “I just don’t think it will
be a losing season.” The next night. his “new look”
Wildcats beat Wake Forest, 62-59. And the skeptics
frowned.

The long draught then set in, and things seemed
at a norm again. Whatever was wrong during those
dismal three and a half weeks, which saw the ’Cats drop
seven straight games, Driesell soon feund out. He juggled
his —, and came up with one that took eight out of
the last fifteen games.

If Driesell didn’t vastly improve Davidson’s record
this year, he did institute something that will prove
valuable in future years — a winning attitude. The
players entered each game believing my | could win.

Driesell’s theory on winning is not blind optimism
or idealism. It is sound fact that has been proved by
the world’s David’s over and over. His theory is sum-
med up on the sign that hangs in the players’ dressing
room: “If you want to win badly enough you will.”

Picking The Winners Of The
Archaic Tournaments

Archaic is the word to describe the Southern and
Atlantic Coast Conference basketball tournaments that
get underway this weekend at Richmond and Raleigh,
respectively.

For three hectic days, won-lost records will be
thrown out the window as each conference seeks a cham-

ion — and.all-time attendance records. In the span of
2 hours, the team that will represent each conference
in the NCAA playoffs will be decided.

Meanwhile, the rest of the nation’s conference

champs, already decided in —— season play, sit back |

and pray for Virginia and VMI to win.

We are very much bec to the tournament sys-
tem, no matter how much money it nets. We believe
that the team who proves that it is the best during a
three-month span is the champion —-not a team that
gets hot three straight nights. At

Despite our sentiment, we admit some exciting
basketball is in store. We'll also stick our necks out
and pull two predictions from the crystal ball . . . West
Virginia to defeat The Citadel in the Southern’s finals,
while Wake Forest is nipping Duke down at Raleigh.

HELPING TRACKSTERS

Seriously, there are better
reasons than these men’s religi-

Dr. Polley was an outstanding
dash-man while at Albion Col-

His best time in the 100 was a

Don Harper Paces
ROTC RIFLE TEAM

This week's “Wildcat of the
Week” honors go to Don Harper,
leading scorer of the highly
regarded Davidson ROTC rifle
squad.

Last week, Harper, paced
the local marksmen to the
state title, when he fired
scores of 376 and 373 out of a
possible 400 points with his
trusty .22 caliber rifle. These
scores enabled him to be Da-
vidson’s high man, and he
finished second only to Caro-
lina’s ace when everyone's
scores had been totaled.

The state meet was a four-
position contest, but regular
season matches are three-posi-

Harper’s best score was an
excellent 287 out of a possible
300.

Harper is a senior from Rock
Hill, S. C., where his rifle career
started. “I used to do a lot of
hunting,” he admits, ‘and that’s
how I got interested in shooting.

“My freshman year, the
ROTC instructor made an
announcement about the rifle

try.

“I believe anyone who can see
the target can become skilled
with a rifle,’ Harper. modestly
declares. “It just requires a lot
of practice.”

Swimmers Journey
To East Carolina

The Davidson College
swimming travels to Green-
ville, N.C., tomorrow for a
meet with East Carolina of
the North State Conference.

The meet had not been orig-
inally scheduled but Coach
Dwight Shoe felt that a two-
week layoff would hinder his
team at the Southern Confer-
ence meet next weekend at Ft.
Eustis, Va.

TONING UP

Shoe commented, “I picked
up the meet for us so that we
can tone up our swimming mus-
cles for the big one next week,” |

However, the yourg mentor
was not implying that the Cat-
fish are taking East Carolina
lightly. The school has an en-
rollment of nearly 6000 stud-
ents, among which should be
some capable tankmen.

FOE IS ALMA MATER

,Carolina in 1953, so tomorrow
will be homecoming for him.

BAD NIGHT
It was a bad night for the
Wildcats from the very begin-
ning as the ball was fumbled,
|passes were intercepted, and
baskets were just barely missed.

Coach Lefty Driesell tried des-
perately to salvage the game by
liberal substitutions, but he
was unable to find a winning
combination.

Managing to cut an early Cit-
adel lead to six points, the
Wildcats trailed at halftime by
a seore of 36-30. However,
All-Conference Gary Daniels
led the Bulldogs in a second-half
surge. Daniels finished with
25 points. Jarman led the Dav-
idson scoring with 24 points,
while Joe Markee tallied 14.

The Citadel game was typi-
cal of the hot and cold-char-
h acter of the Wildcats’ 1960-61
season. Having lost to the

game there by a total of 24
points.
