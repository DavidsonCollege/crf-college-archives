CA and Young Buck wish first

off to apulogize to the freshmen
ball players on S-3. An

erroneous scorecard showed
the incredibly bad Crankateers

actually beating S-3. In reality
however, the §.3 powerhouse
crushed the cranks 11-5 From
the third floor boys we ask
forgiveness. To the winless
cranks we say a tough break for
a bunch of bad competitors.

CLUB FOOTBALL INACTION

The club football team concluded its spring season over Easter
weekend with a 26-8 loss to Central Piedmont. Davidson's lone
touchdown came when Don Long blocked a punt which was
recovered by Eric Scharling in the end zone.

Davidson's workhorse was David Overton, who picked up 55 yards
in twelve carries. Overton also handled the kicking and punting
chores. The loss put the club football team's spring record at 0-2.

Golf Places Second

In SC Tournament

By ED SIBLEY

Davidson's golf team finished
its season with a strong second
place finish in the Southern Con-
ference Tournament. The Cats
finished behind a strong Fur-
man team tor the 54-hole tour-
nament, while boasting — the
lowest individual scorer in
Rusty Bovd

Led by Beyd and Scott Shet-
tall. who had an even-par 72,
Davidson found themselves
only three strokes down at the
end cf ine urst round.

The Wildcats surged into a
four-stroke lead at the end of
the second day. It looked as if
the Cats might be able to pull a
big upset and win the crown.
But they faltered and finished
second to winner Furman by
eight strokes.

For the season, Davidson
posted a 3-2 record in individual
meets, including a big win over
Duke. The Cats also par-
ticipated in four tournaments.
The last two, the Chris Schenkel
and the SC. were back-to-back.
Davidson performed
creditably, beating out several

scholarshiped teams and
gleaning a lot of good ex-
perience.

The tourney finish was a nice
surprise. Most felt the Cats
would probably finish fourth or
third at best.

Boyd was the mainstay for
the Wildcats this year. He has
been the most consistent player
on the squad the past three

vears, and his coach, Tom

Scott, called him, “tar and
away the best’ player in- the
conference. ~

Boyd will probably go to the

NCAA National Championship °

at Stillwater, Okla. which be-
gins on June 18

Scott said that despite the in-
creased competitiveness in the
conterence, Davidson should be
in good shape next year. A fine

who played well all year.
sophomore Bob Rennie, and
freshmen Jerry Horne, Brant
Whitney and George Wilson will
be carried over, he indicated.

“Many of the teams in the
conference give grants to
golfers.’ said Scott. “but we
should be tough since we will
have some very experienced
players.”
