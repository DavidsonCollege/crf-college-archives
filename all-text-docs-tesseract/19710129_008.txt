Rules Changes

By RICH WILSON
Asst, Managing Editor

In a special meeting yes-
terday, the faculty began
deliberation on a_ revised
edition of academic regula-
tions reworked and recom-
mended by the Educational
Policy Committee (EPC).

For the next two Thurs-
days the faculty will con:
tinue their discussions on
. the regulations which includ-
ed what one EPC. member
calls ‘‘wide and sweeping
changes.”

One of the major proposed
changes is to abolish the
pluses .on all grades. This
would affect a-«four point
grade scale and bring grade
points in line with quality
points.

. “The committee seemed to
‘feel that the pluses on grades
were given arbitrarily;

~ there is too fine a division
between a B plus and an A,”
said Danny Clodfelter, stu-
dent member of the EPC.

Vice President of Aca-
demic Affairs John ‘M. Bev-
an also: noted that pluses
caused problems in the use
of percentiles:

Another proposed: change
States that the faculty must
announce reviews at least
one week in’ advance. The
faculty also would be respon-
sible for makeup reviews and

giving  incompletes. on
‘grades, whereas previously
these functions were held by
the Deah of Students.

The EPC! proposed that
faculty not be compelled to

tions

send absences to the Vice
President for Academic Af-
fairs at the end of the term;
however, the one quarter cut
policy would still be in ef-
fect.

“The fact that the cut
policy is not abolished along
With the recording of ab-
sences is the mosf€ irrational
thing I have ever seen,”
said Clodfelter. ‘‘The logic of
this policy escapes me.”

In the proposed regula-
students may with-.
draw from the college with-
out parental permission.
Previously a letter was need-
ed from the student’s par-
ents.

If these regulations are
passed by the faculty, stu-
dents would also be allowed
to choose to take a course
pass-fail without the  per-
mission of the faculty mem-
ber,

_ In other words the faculty
would submit letter grades
for each students and then
the registrar would convert
any grades into pass-fail.
The faculty would not neces-

sarily know. who was taking -

a pass-fail course and who
was not.

Concerning extended stu-
dies, the EPC clarified that
no faculty member could be
responsible for more: than
two extended study pro-
jects, at one time and no
more than six per year.

Bevan said he hoped the
faculty would take final
action on these regulations
during the March 2 meeting.

* ‘Love Story’ Evokes

ED. NOTE: The Movie ‘Love
Story’ has evoked many dif-
ferent responses so we have
elected ‘to run both a pro
and a con review.

The final tournament of
1970 which Davidson de-
baters attended was. the
famed Dixie Classic Varsity
Tournament at Wake Forest
University. ‘Ihe two teams

‘Davidson's first great for-
ensic battle of 1971 will be
the ‘Wingate Invitational,
where ‘Bill Eskridge and
John Douglas will represent
the college.

The team hopes to be_able
to attend at least three tour-
naments in February; the
Harvard Invitational and the
Dartmouth Varsity Debate
Tournament are _ possibili-
ties.

Asked what advantage .a
debate team could be to the
college, veteran .debater
(Mark Deininger said, ‘‘A
well-known debate program
would help Davidson's sag-
ging admissions applications
and would, on the average,
attract a higher quality stu-
dent to Davidson."’

Since the departure of

assistant professor of drama
and speech, in 1969, the Da-
vidson debate team has been
without a regular coach. The
team officers hope to obtain
one someday, but in the

The team officers are sen-
