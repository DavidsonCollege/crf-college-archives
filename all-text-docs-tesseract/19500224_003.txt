PRINCES RUSH CINDERELLAS TO QUEENS;
GET FULL WHAMMY FROM DEAN WHEN LATE

By PETE MILNER

Sing, oh Heavenly Muse,
of all the local yokels who in twain

Did rend my purse.

Nay, lament the sad fate of all

Davidson daters.

As our half-track manuvered
about the tank traps and land mines,
I felt myself slowly melting to the
floor as my heart played Saint
Vitus on my lower intestinal—forti-
tude. Trying to heal my misshap-
ened nerves, I gaped, from my po-
sition on the floor, up at an inscrip-
tion on the gate.

“Let no man enter in on pain of
death!”

I finally collected my wits, how-
ever, by making several blasse pass-
es id te rear-view mirror, from
the which I chose the most “Hum-
phrey Bogartish.” Our open air
Buick rumbled to a halt; and after
inspecting the lugs on our treads
to insure a quick getaway, we cross.

an inscribed inlay.

“This drive was put here by the
efforts of the class of 1939. Barbed
wirefand pitfalls later generously
added by our everwatchful faculty.”

Trudging up the stairs, I opened
the door and sauntered into Alls-
well Hall only to have by medulla
oblongata neatly creased by a rub-
ber fruncheon wielded by one of
the “students friends.” Recovering
some hours after the dance had
.started, I asked the dean to forgive
my unannounced entree and quer-

ied the whereabouts of date (with)

whom I had prenatally made this
engagement). She explained that of
coursé there were several forms that
must be inspected. Mine happened

to leave their books once every se-

proceeded to the chaperone, room
where the inmate, full of the bile of
human kindness, consented to let
us go as a congenial little coterio of
ten honor-bound couples.

We arrived just before intermis-

three or four couples there yet. At
the risk of being tedious, I will
say that: everyone had a mellow
time. Gentlemen with rented tux,

PROF. HOWARD THOMAS

Famous Art Professor Will
Present Lecture At Davidson

Professor Howard Thomas of tlic
University of Georgia Art Depart-
ment will be on the Campus March
6 and 7. Davidson. is indeed fortu-
nate to have so accomplished a
visitor as Proféssor Thomas, who
has been the recipient of numerous
honors in the field of Art: In 1938,
and again in 1941 Professor Thom-
as received first prize for water col.
ors at the Wisconsin Salon of the
University of Wisconsin. In 1945
he was given first prize for an oil
Exhibit. In 1946 he excelled again
at the Association of Georgia Art
in the field of water colors and. re-
ceived a first prize in that year. He
was appointed head of the Art De-
partment at Agnes Scott College in
1943, where he remained until -he
accepted his present position. Since
then, Professor Thomas has been
carrying on serious research in
grinding his own pigments which he
gathers from the earth.

Professor Thomas is a native of
Ohio. He studied at the Ohio State
University and the Chicago Art In-
stitute. After a period of study in
Europe, he turned to art teaching
and became Director of the Art
Department at Milwaukee State
Teachers College where he painted
some of his most vigorous water
colors and oils. In 1936 he was
awarded the Milwaukee Art Insti.
tute medal for his oil “Haymarket
Square” and the painting was added
to the permanent collection of the
Art Institute.

At the. present time he and his
wife, Mary Thomas, are currently
circulating a point exhibit of paint-
tings through Eastern galleries.

While at Davidson, Professor
Thomas’ schedule is being arrang-
ed by the Committee on Fine Arts,

which will include addresses to
several meetings and a two hour
demonstration on painting a water
color, which will be open to the
public. Professor Thomas will be
available for individual conferences.

Chorus To Depart On
Annual Spring Tour

The Davidson College Male Cho-
tus on its annual spring tour will
give concerts in Waycross in south
Georgia and in the northwestern
part of Florida. The chorus will
leave the campus on Thursday
morning, March 2, and will per-
form that night in Waycross, Geor-
gia. From there they shall go to
Quincy, Florida, for a concert Fri-
day night. Saturday night will find
them in Pensacola for a special
program of secular music. They
will remain there to sing for the
morning worship service at the
First Presbyterian Church on Sun.
day morning and to hold a vespers
service of sacred music there that
afternoon. Monday the group will
continue to De Funiak Springs and
Tuesday they will move on to Clear-
water, where they will conclude

the tour. Wednesday they will re-||

turn to Davidson.

In the course of the tour con-
certs of sacred and of secular mu-
sic will be given. The sécular con-
cert in Pensacola will be a special
program of music by contempor-
ary American composers such as
Randall Thompson and Cecil Ef-
finger. It will include poems of Carl
Sandburg and Walt Whitman set
to music, several of Fred Waring’s

THE DAVIDSONIAN
United Nations Experts Map
Highway Network For Europe

Geneva—Europe now has a plan for a continental highway
system, its first since the fall of ancient Rome. 5

The plan foresees a road network of 23 major and 61 feeder
routes. linking cities as far apart as Helsinki and Marseilles,
Edinburgh and Rome. 1 was drawn up here by transport ex-
perts from 10 European countries and the U.S.A., meeting under
the auspices of the United Nations Evonomie Commission for

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1950

Europe (ECE).

ilbe highway experts believe
that better roads will not only im-
prove intra-European commerce
and ease the way for travellers but
will also help Europeans of differ-
ent countries learn to understand
each other better as a result of
freer flow of ideas, goods and peo-
ple from one nation to another.
They point out that the highway
plan for Europe is similar to the
highly-bencficial net-work worked
out in the USA by the United States
Public Roads Administration in co-
operation with the states.

ECE has already laid down stan-
dards for improving existing Euro-
pean roads and building new ones.
The standards cover road widths
crossfalls, gradients, - alignments,
curves, types. of pavement, inter-
sections, visibility; bridges tunnels
and other important engincering
questions. so. ;

Three categories of roads are pro-
vided for in the standards. The first

rincludes two-lane highways approx-

imately 23 feet wide — much broad-

‘er than the average European roads.

The second class covers ten-foot
wide lanes separated by a central
strip. The third category consists
of three-lane roads, totaling 33-feet
in width. In addition, cycte tracks
and footpaths would be provided
wherever traffic makes them neces-
Sary.

The second over-all step in turn-

‘ing highway plans into reality 1s

aiready underway. ECF. sent a ques-
tionnaire to the countries involved,
asking whether man-power, mater-
ial and equipment for road build-
ing would be available in the next
ten years. Most countries have al-
ready -replied that labor and = ma-
terial could be found. Many na-
tions, however, lack some of the
road-building materials and equip-
ment necessary and, therefore, ECE
‘is now studying financing methods.

Another yreat project involving

roads, meanwhile, is also underway
as the result of an agreement be-
tween France and ‘Italy. This pro-
ject — part of a much-needed gen-
eral effort to elithinate natural bar-
tiers to automobile travel — pro-
vides for the construction of 4 tun-
nel through the Alps wear Mont
Blane, the highest
Europe.

(The perennial engineering dream
of building a tunnel under the Eng-
lish Channel has also been discuss-
ed, but experts do not regard this
as feasible yet).

The natural barrier formed by
the 800-mile crescent of the Alps
is important not only because it
blocks. Italy from the rest of Eu-
rope but also because it lies on
the most direct route from West-
ern Europe to the Balkan couti-
tries. The mountain passes, which
front time immemorial have linked
Italy and the Balkans with the
north, are covered with deep snow
much of the year and are frequent-

ROTC Is Revamped
Under Col. Ballard

From the time in September
when Colonel Ballard assumed the
leadership of Davidson's ROTC de-
partment many changes have been
brought about.

This years ROTC staff have
worked — steadily at = making the
course more worth the students
time. These men feel an obligation
to Davidson and to the govern-
ment. In carrying out their pro-
gram they have attempted to’ give
each student individual attention
to acquaint themselves with each
man’s background, interests, and
extracurricular activities. Thus they
‘are better ‘able to plan the progress
of the four ROTC courses, along
lines which will interest: students.

This year far more than ever be-
fore moving pictures, pictorial de-
vices, and the narration of combat
experience have been utilized in
the training program. Special pre-
sentations of all weapons have been
made immediately after the study
of weapons, for example, in order
to tie together the subject as thor-
oughly as possible.

In addition to planning the -in-

| structional technique with greater

efficiency and thought the ROTC
department has assisted in training
the college band, in caring for
