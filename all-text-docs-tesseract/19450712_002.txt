Challenge

Shortly after the beginning. of this
summer term, new student body, class
and various other officers took over the
responsibility of leading the campus life
here at Davidson, amidst various speeches,
comments, jokes, and serious congratula-
tions and thanks to the retiring officers
for “jobs well done”. Many were the pro-
mises of faithfulness, realization of re-
sponsibility, and determination to build
toward better things in all respects.

Many are the men who in the years
past have accepted the responsibilities of
leadership on this campus. Their respon-
sibilities, woes, hopes, recognition, and
accomplishments have been varied. Some
have traveled harder roads than others.
Some have received unearned praise, and
some undeserved criticism. The majority
have been faithful towards those who put
them into their position. Some few have
not. But for the greater part, the various
officers and leaders have done a_ job,
maybe not the best, but as well as has
been possible. To the group go the thanks
and commendations of the student body.

New responsibilities always seem too
great, else, they are not worth having.
Unless a man may profit by his position

_he should not have it. The profit that
may come to the man is dependent on the
quanity and quality of that which he pe
into his particular job.

Now is the time for new hopes” a
plans. Our leaders at present seem quite
capable. Some few will fail, but the ones
that come thru are the ones that make it
all worth while. The shoes left vacant
have been filled well. The abilities are
present, which leaves only the qustion
of the will to work, about-which no one
can prophesy.

Accomplishment is measured in various
ways. To many it means the actual re-
sults, or the lack of them. However, all
persons can’t be judged on the same basis.

Judgment should be on a basis of relative

best.”

Hall Prayer Meetings . .

Each WedneSday evening at 10 o’clock
there awaits in a certain room on each
floor of the dorm a simple but impressive
meeting. These weekly gatherings have
been an established feature on the campus
for several generations. The meetings
this summer are under the capable leader-
ship of Harry McLean, who reports that
the attendance so far consists of only a

fair portion of the students here now. :

Students, remember that these Hall Pray-
er Meetings are being conducted for your
benefit. Something new and different is
always gained each week by attending
these meetings. And so, when you hear
the bell ringing. next Wednesday night
at 10 o'clock, drop that magazine, or that
or anything else at the time, and
go to the room on your floor where the
Hall Prayer Meeting is being conducted.
The meetings are usually short and to the
point. Remember to back your Hall Pray-
er Meeting by being present!

‘Gay...

.Within the past few weeks, the stu-
dents of this noble institution, in their
daily rounds of the campus have seen a
figure which is now™~becoming a very
familiar sight. Lounging within the hal-
lowed walls of our ‘Stud’, one finds
“Gay-Son of ‘Shakey’ ’’—the brown and
white collie that delights in retrieving
objects for anyone who will condescend
to amuse himself by tossing them.

Though Gay hasn’t contrived to win
the sympathy ‘of the warm-hearted Da-
vidson students by contracting St. Vitus’s
Dance, he seems to definitely be slowly
winning a place in their hearts by -his
energetic antics.

There is some question among the more
intellectual students as to the sanity of

ur “fast becoming mascot”. Some con-
sider Gay to be slightly (?) eccentric
while other's are weighing the possibilities
of giving him a Phi Bate key.” While we
recognize his unusual abilities, we don’t
quite think he’s that smart. We do think
that if he could talk, we would have a
fortune waiting in the sale of his pep and
energy tonic. His energy seems limitless
as he ruins mile’ during a day, returning
sticks and Dixie Cup tops to boys who
don’t want them back.

We end this ‘Dissertation on Gay”
with an appeal. Next time you’re in the
Stud and hear a pleading whine at your
heels, it’s not some lowly Freshman—it’s
just Gay. When this happens, throw
something—throw anything in any direc-
tion, because Gay must be kept happy
and well, for look. what happened to
Shaky!

the tables in the lounge, and we
hope to supply you with some recent
recordings soon. The scathing re-
marks about the old-fashioned re-
cordings of “corn” have prompted
the cabinet members to take steps
toward ordering some new records
for you. The Carnegie set of Sym-
phonitrecordings is also at the “Y”.
This is a very valuable collection
of fine recordings, scores, books a-
bout music together with a custom-
built record player and speaker. This
is one of the few collections of its
kind in the country. Request pto-
grams can be arranged.

We have been hearing some ex-
cellent talks this summer from our
own cabinet members and from
outside speakers. Sonny Blain is
proving to be a good “presider” on
Thursday mornings. Newt Spencer
“drove home” a point in his chapel
talk in “Your Record” by demon-
strating it with an actual phono-
graph record. Ed Golden said some
worthwhile things about Our Op-
portunity, and I don’t think any-

Court Secrets Revealed

We, the highly exalted members
of the Davidson College Official
Court, of Control, empowered with
the noble task of ensuring the life,
liberty, and pursuit of happiness of
our Freshmen class, have beeh re-
quested to publish the Official Notes
of a Court Meeting, so that those
unfortunate souls who have never
had the honor of attefiding such’a
meeting may experience in some
small way the joys found there.
Therefore,we do hereby and herein
publish and reveal the Official Notes
of the Court of Control Meeting
held at 10 P. M. on the night of
June 19, 1945¢ \

1. Mr. Whittier requested the
privilege of escorting Mr. Royster
to the hallowed halls of the Court,
for, as Mr. Whittier told the Court,
he felt so close to Mr. Royster
that he did not wish to be denied
those moments of ecstasy together.
Mr. Royster was escorted into the
Court promptly at 10 P. M., in-
troduced to the members of the
Court, then ushered to a lounge
chair, provided for his convenience
during the friendly discussions which
followed. SY

As Mr. Royster entered Mr. Whit-
tier impressed upon the court his
proficiency in “the light fantastic”,
as he so aptly. expressed it. The
Court applauded, although it at
first supposed Mr. Whittier to be
speaking of himself, and only later
came to see that it was Mr. Roy-
ster who was intended by the re-
mark. During the discussion be-
tween the Court and Mr. Royster
as to the latter’s alleged violations
of Freshman Regulations, Mr. Roy-
ster remarked that he was confused,
and all turned upside down about it.
It is typical of the consideration of
the Court that Mr. Royster was al-
lowed to stand on his head for the
further deliberations of the Court.
On the other hand, Mr. Royster, out
of respect for the Court, did not
feel that he should maintain such
an informal posture indefinitely.
and soon resumed his original pos-

ture.

2. Next Mr. Miller was escorted

into the beautiful. court of justice.
The Court was so touched to the
quick by Mr. Miller’s evident timi-
dity and reticence that it did not
have the heart to inform him of
the unfortunate charges brought
against him. Instead, the Court in-
formed Mr. Miller of the high
opinion held of him by the whole
student body. Amid such blushing
and evident embarrasment Mr. Mil-
ler attempted to express his ap-
preciation. ‘

This so pleased the court that they
informed Mr. Miller that it was the
unanimous desire. of the Court to
campus itself for two months for
being so indiscreet as even to sus-
pect Mr. Miller of having infringed
upon any Freshmen regulation. Mr.
Wells was asked to escort Mr. Mil-
ler to the dogr, but it was soon
discovered that Mr. Wells. was so
engrossed in a game of Post Office
with Mr. Wall that he did not hear.
Therefore Judge Lazenby adjourn-

‘ed the Court until he himself could

escort Mr, Miller safely to his room.

3. Mr. Barksdale appeared next.
After he had made himself com-
fortable in the red plush armchair:
Provided for his convenience, Mr:
McDonald’s aesthetic appreciation
could not but express itself as it
viewed Mr. Barksdale under the
mellowing effects of the subdued
and romantic candles used for light-
