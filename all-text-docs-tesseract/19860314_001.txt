Cats take SC title, clinch NCAA bid

By EMIL CEKADA

After finals, while everyone
else at Davidson College headed
for Florida and Bermuda, coach
Hussey led his squad to Asheville
for the high point of the basketball
season, the Southern Conference
Tournament. The team did not get
to work on their tans but they did
have the best weekend of anyone
from Davidson, just ask Gerry
Born.

Friday night Davidson opened
the tournament against VMI. The
Monday before, Gay Elmore had
hit 35 as VMI defeated Davidson.
VMI jumped to a 4-0 lead but
senior Gerry Born drilled a 15 foo-
ter and then sandwiched two put-
back baskets around junior Ace
Tanner’s alley-oop tip-in, giving
Davidson their first lead 8-6.

The tone of the game was set.
From that point on, the Wildcats
owned the paint at both ends of the
court. The Keydets were forced to
live and die by the jumper. VMI
managed to hit over the Davidson
zone early and had regainded a 15-
12 lead when Tanner banked in a
one-hander to start a 10 point
Davidson tear. Elmore’s 12 points

kept VMI close and the halftime
score was 26-23.

VMI once again opened the
half with four quick points but
junior Chris Heineman’s driving
basket in the lane gave Davidson
the lead for good. The defense
tightened up again, led by Heine-
man and Tanner. They drew the
job of shutting down Elmore. He
was two of nine from the field in
the second half. The interior de-
fense was even better as VMI's
semi-potent front line scored only
22 points including Elmore’s 18
which came mostly from outside.

Meanwhile Davidson  col-
lected balanced scoring from
sophomores Derek Rucker and
Jeff Himes, as well as Tanner and
Born with 17, 15, 15, and 14
points respectively.

Rucker also hit five of six free
throws, (11 of 12 for the night), as
Davidson ran a free throw shoot-
ing clinic over the last five mi-
nutes, hitting 15 of 18. The Cats
moved into the semi-finals 71-62.

When they arrived, Davidson
found East Tennessee State wait-
ing for them. Two-time defending
champ Marshall was caught look-

ing ahead towards Davidson, and
a sharp-shooting ETSU team sent
them packing.

ETSU could not find the range
early against Davidson. Senior
Jim McConkey’s eight points
helped Davidson open up an 11
point lead 21-10. A sudden rash of
fouls sent all three Davidson big
men to the bench with two apiece.
Albert Sams entered the game and
sparked ETSU. Davidson went
cold hitting only four of 15 shots
to finish the half, which ended tied
at 32.

In the second half, the Wildcat
starting front line returned and
took up right where they had left
off, scoring inside. Steve Shirley
(who drew ‘you are fat” cheers
from Davidson’s home crowd)
scored eight points to keep the
Wildcats from ending the game
early. ETSU received another
break when Born was given a
technical foul for hanging on the
rim, after he lost the ball while
going for a dunk. Stallings drilled
the free throw, and ETSU had
some spark again, tying the score
at 48 with their next basket.

Hussey lit a spark of his own
when he drew a technical foul for
arguing a call. ETSU got one of
the free throws and followed with
a three-point play. They led 52-48
but then the Cats took control.
Crashing the boards and continu-
ing to hit free throws, Davidson
was soon ahead 58-56. The Cats
hit their free throws and Himes
added a Monster Jam to close the
game, final score 74-65. David-
son’s bench (Himes, seniors Pep-
per Bego and Ken Niehbur and
sophomore Todd Scott) kept the
game in control while the starters
were on the bench with foul
trouble. Rucker and Tanner (who
had 17 points, three blocks and
four steals) both deserve recogni-
tion for their semi-Final perfor-
mances. Rucker, who went all 40
minutes, finished with 12 points,
seven assists, four steals and only

e two turnovers while running the

offense flawlessly.
The Wildcats took the court

a against UTC for the finals, wear-

ing their black (away) uniforms.
But the players must have seen the
sign which read “Welcome to
Johnston Gym” and heard the old

familiar spelling of C-A-T-S be-
cause they played like they were at
home. Rucker hit four long jum-
pers and the Cats roared out to a
17-6 lead.

The Davidson defense was as
tough as always, but much to
UTC’s credit they bent but they
would not break. UTC tightened
up their own defense and kept
hustling. The basket suddenly got
very small for Davidson. Easy
shots were not falling. UTC began
to contest every shot and fight a
little harder for every rebound and
loose ball. After 20 minutes, UTC
had cut the lead down to seven,
23-17.

UTC kept clawing early in the
second half and with 12:18 to go,
they took the lead 30-29. Tanner
was called in to shut down Carliss
Jeter, who had 12 points at that
time. Tanner held Jeter to only
one more bucket in the remainder
of the game and Heineman and
Rucker brought Davidson back to
a 36-36 tie.

With two minutes left David-
son once again looked inside to
Born, who drew a foul and went to
the line. Born had missed three of
his last four free throws, during
the second half, so there was some
anxiety as the Davidson fans
raised their arms. Born stepped to
theline and fired. . . whoosh!
and again whoosh! to make 38-36.
UTC’'s Gibson countered 39 sec-
onds later and it was tied again,

Senior Ken Niebuhr enjoys the fruits of victory.

Sports Information

38-38.

Davidson's next trip down the
court resulted in Born being
fouled while shooting and heading
to the foul line again. Nothing
sounded sweeter than the whoosh
that followed both of Born’s free
throws, 40-38,

UTC worked the ball around
looking for their last shot, which
did not materialize as Tanner stole
a pass and was then fouled going
down the court. His free throw rat-
tled out and UTC called a timeout
to set up their last shot. Though
poorly planned, Dwight Harris
canned a 20-foot shot with nine
seconds remaining and a 40-40
score.

By the time Davidson called a
timeout, only three seconds were
left to be played. On the following
inbounds play, Himes caught a
perfect strike from Born at half-
court and instantly called time
with two seconds left.

The next play was designed to
go to either Rucker or Heineman,
who were to run off screens set by
Born and McConkey. UTC
covered the play well and Born
came out to receive the ball from
Tanner as the last option of the
play. Born dribbled once as he
turned and then fired. The high,
arching 22-footer hit nothing but
net. Davidson won 42-40, taking
the Southern Conference cham-

pionship and the subsequent
NCAA bid.
