New Gym Building as Proposed.

Contract to Be Let
For New Gym This Week

Bailding Will Probably be Com-
pleted by Next Fall.

The contract for this long needed and
eagerly looked for addition to our ma-
terial equipment will be let before the
middle of this week, and work will go
forward as rapidly as possible. It. is
confidently expected that it will be ready
for service, under the leadership of our
new Gymnasium Director, Mr. Mack-
cy, when college opens in the fall.

The building is to be of brick. The
basement being above ground, it will be
practically three stories high. Above
the basement, where team rooms, shower
rooms and lockers will be found, is the
main floor of the gymnasium room 58
feet 2 inches by 90 feet 10 inches, with
balcony on three sides. The floor of
this room is hard maple and the trusses
overhead of steel; the pitch is two
stories,

In front of the gymnasium proper are
two tiers of rooms. On the first floor
to the left of the wide lobby is the auxil-
iary gymnasium, 26 feet by 30 fect 2
inches; on the left is the director's office
and two rooms for physical examination.
In the tier above is found living quar-
ters for the director and a club room.

The building is 91 by 95 fect 6 inches,
outside dimensions, with a high pillared
porch in front. The whole is colonial
in character.

The swimming pool is designed to
communicate with the basement of this
building and to be in a separate enclos-
oure on the south side. Funds for this,
owing to the unexpected great advance
in cost of building, are not now on
,hand, but it is hoped to add it soon.

Twenty-five thousand dollars is avail-
able, and every dollar will be expended
to complete the work just as far as pos-
sible.

Miss Mary Jackson, of Gastonia, has
been visiting her brother, Mr. F. L.
Jackson.

for the permanent organization of this
body and in the future the Southern

At this meeting Professor Fulton read
the. main paper, the subject being
“Southern Literature.” “Uhis is a sub-
ject in which Professor Fulton has been
very much interested and he has been
very active in stirring up the South to a
realization of the value of her own lit-
erature. Recently he published a book.
“Southern Life in Southern Literature,”
which has received much favorable com-
ment. In his paper before the confer-

ence, Proféssor Fulton urged that col-|

leges make entrance requirements in
English include « study of our own lit-
erature. He also called attention to the
fact that the South has a most fertile
field of literature and a development
which makes the literature distinctive.
Those who teach our literature should
realize this and understand the spirit of
the South for an intelligent interpreta-
tion of it.

Professor Fulton was elected President
of the organization for the ensuing year.
The other officers elected were the Vice-
Presidents, C. W. Steed, of Mercer
University, Georgia; Dewitt Croissant,
George Washington University, District
of Columbia; O. B. Staples, Louisiana
State University: J. M. Grainger, of
Virginia State Normal College.
