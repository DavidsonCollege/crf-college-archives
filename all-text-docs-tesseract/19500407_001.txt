The Eumenean Literary Society
had one of its most lively meetings
of the year at Eu Hall on Monday
evening. Starting out in the usual
formal, manner, the meeting pro-
ceded to produce fireworks béfore

contested debate.

The meeting was opened with a
devotional by President J. W.
Campbell after which Parliamen.
tarian Jack Hunter taok the floor
and gave a few helpful facts con-
cerning Parliamentary procedure for
making a motion, gaining the
floor, and the general conduct of a
formal meeting or debate.

Program Committee, then present-
ed the program for the evening —

Phi Society Gives
Post-Season Glance
At Scripts ‘n Pranks

The Philanthropic Literary So-
ciety turned mortician at its regu-
lar meeting Tuesday night in or-
der to perform an autopsy on the
recently released college humor
magazine, Scripts ’n Pranks. Bill
Hamilton, edjtor of the magazine
and Nei} Leach, program chairman,
were the chief dissectors,

Editor Hamilton, himself, opencd
the way for criticism and discus
sion by outlining a four-point pur-
pose for the existence of the maga.
zine.

1. To provide an outlet for stu-
dent literary expression.

2. To furnish the student body
with material of interest and en-
tertainment.

3. To provide an opportunity for

practical experience in putting out-

a magazine, making up for the lack
of journalistic training in the School
curriculum.

4. To be a voice of student views
and give a fairly representative

picture of student accomplish-
ment to those readers outside the
school,

He followed his outline with a
brief discussion of the headaches
connected with such a publication.

Leach rose to criticize the maga-
zine on all four points, stating that

it was neither a voice of student!’

views nor provided an outlet for
student literary expression in that
its contributors are limited to a se-
lect few who are “repeaters” in each
‘issue.

He maintained it failed to give
anyone save the editor any practi-
cal experience because the editor
selfishly ‘regarded it as his own
particularly “baby.”

STUDENT ART CONTEST

The committee on Fine Arts
at Davidson College has an-
nounced plans for a student art
contest which will be held the
last of this month.

Paintings done in oils, water
colors, pastels, and other media
will be considered by the judg-
es. An exhibit of the submitted
paintings will be displayed in
Chamber’s building on April
29th. It is not required that en-
tries be original, but . copies
must be labeled as such.

Students are urged to turn in
their entries not later than April
24th to Wylie Smith, 214 East
Dormitory.

Citizens Committee
Enacts Housing Plan

Work has begun on the first of
a planned 9-10 unit housing pro.
gram on purchased lots in the Mock
Hill district of Davidson. This
house will be occupied by John
Heath, janitor of Georgia Dormi-
tory, who is using his own money
with the supervision of the Citi-
zen’s Committee. Two of these lots
have been sold to Dr. Watts who
also intends to erect homes for
Negroes. In addition there are 2 or
3 other Negro families ready
and able to build new homes in
an effort to relieve the over-crowd-
ed conditions in Brady’s Alley.
Further action on the part of the
Citizen's Committee has come in
the form of: (1) a recommendation
to the Town Council asking for en-
forcement of a city ordinance which
requires all landlords owning hous.
es adjacent to a city sewer line to
connect those houses with the line,
(2) a similar recommendation re-
questing the adoption of a housing
plan comparable to that of Char-
lotte’s.

Dean of Students, John C. Bailey and Dr. Lewis B. Schenck
recommended Tuesday afternoon in a joint meeting of the

ing year would be carried on during the first two weeks of

Woodrow Wilson and Dr. J. R.

jokes about members of the Senior
Class in the fraternity.

semester.

Professors in the college had
petitioned the faculty committee
leaded by Dr. Schenck to recon-
sider and further discuss the prob.
lems that would arise next Fall, Dr.
Schenck clearly stated to a joint
group that the faculty committee
now engaged in finding a workable
solution has not made this their
final decision; that next year, after
% more complete inspection of the
system as it exists, the problem
would again demand renewed at-
tention. At that time it is hoped
that a permanent rushing week
may be designated for the school
calendar of the future.

Earlier in the year, student-facul-
ty discussion groups aired the pros

‘and the cons of the question. The

main points being:
Second Semester Points—

1, The scholastic average of the
fraternity men fall below the school
average. This is peculiar to most
campuses. It is believed that the
first two weeks of school which
are largely devoted to rushing is
responsible for a large part of this
fact.

2. A second semester system
would give both fraternities and
rushees: a better chance to know
one another.

First Semester Points—

1. Since fraternities are relatively
small. and because they operate
their own boarding houses, they
are dependent on the first semester
pledges if they are to continue eat-
ing together as a group. Were the
system to change to second semes-

Campus Club Group
Will Petition A. T. 0

Forty-five members of the Cam-
pus Club this. week received facul-
ty approval to petition the Alpha
Tau Omega fraternity. This action
was the final green light for pe-
titioning procedures by the organi-
zation now known as Kappa Kappa,
whose members were once a part ot
the Campus Club.

According to a unanimous agree-
ment a group of about ten under
classmen who wish to continue the
Campus>Club will maintain the
original organization next fall, Next
year’s club will retain ownership of
the house furniture while the larg-
er Kappa Kappa group will pos-
sess the boarding house.

Both the petitioners and the non-
petitioners will continue to operate
the house and boarding house joint-
ly under the present officers of
the Campus Club for the remainder
of the college year. Each group.
however, has elected its own offi-
cers and is laying plans for a final ©
separation in June. Kappa Kappa
plans to secure a house on Frater-
nity Court before next September.

ATO would make the eleventh
national social fraternity at David-
son. The first fraternity formed af-
ter the Civil War, ATO is one of
the large and well known nation-
als, with 107 chapters, and some
50,000 members. Other chapters in
this area are at Duke, UNC, USC,
Charleston, W. Va., and W. & L.

The Campus Club, organized on
October 13, 1947, has led an in.
creasingly useful existance, natural-
ly evolving from a loose-knit organ-
ization into a more compact and
congenial brotherhood. It will con.
tinue as originally planned in the
future.
