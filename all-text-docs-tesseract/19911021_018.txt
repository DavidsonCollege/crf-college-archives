ockey Goes 3-3-1 Over Two Weeks With Win Over Wake

By: Jennifer Roos

The hockey team is adjusting
to a something new this season:
LOSING. They do not have the
opportunity to repeat last season’s
record with one loss, yet even with
more losses the team is much bet-
ter than last year’s team. It is very
ironic, and the team isb having to
adjust for this pseudo consolation
prize. °

Before fall break Davidson
faced University of Louisville and
Longwood College. It took two
overtimes before the game ended
in a tie 1-1 against Louisville.
Sophomore Suzanne Hardesty
scored the second goal of her ca-
reer in the second half from twenty-
five yards out. The Cardinals re-
taliated ona very bizarre goal. The
ball must cross the line before
counting as a goal as in any other
sport, yet their shot hit the inside
posts of the cage then bounced
outward. This was the first tie of
the season for the Wildcats.

The following day the Wild-
cats took their frustration out on
a small school from Farmville,
Virginia. Davidson used their
strong passing game to earn a 2-0
victory. Co-captain Mary Russ
and junior Jennifer Roos each

scored a goal while Emily Coleman
preserved the shutout.

While most Davidson students
were tanning on a sunny beach or
beating up their younger siblings
at home, the hockey team was off
to Richmond to face first time
opponents Virginia Common-
wealth University and University
of Richmond. Along with these
two games Davidson participated
ina Challenge Discovery which is
a leadership and trust course of
mental and physical activities.

Davidson rose to the occasion
against VCU, a toptwenty team, to
play their best and last turf game of
the season. The Rams were held
scoreless until twenty minutes
remaining in the first half then
scored off acorner and would later
follow up with two more goals
solely off corner attempts. Even
though much of the game was
played in the middle of the field,
yet VCU dominated in corner at-
tempts while Davidson had only
one corner.

They made that onecountearly
in the secondhalf. Jacquelin Ukrop
took the hitout to Jenny Plowright,
who stopped the ball dead for the
striker Roos. It was perfectly
executed, and this sparked the team

Men's Tennis Tops |
UNCC ‘49ers, Coastal Chanticleers

’ By Robert Grubb

The men’s tennis team con-
tinued to roll through its fall sea-
son with victories in the Davidson
Fall Classic
over two tradi-
tionally tough
opponents,
UNCC and
Coastal Caro-
lina. The Wild-
cats nearly shut
out the Forty-
Niners on Fri-
day, posting an
11-2 win, and
lost no momen-
tum in beating

Coastal 7-2.
UNCC has
traditionally
been a nemesis
to the Wildcats.
The two teams
have played
each other quite closely over the
” past several seasons. UNCC, how-
ever, lost its number two and three
players from last season to gradu-
ation and academic ineligibility,

respectively.

Coach Jeff Frank was especially
pleased with the play of Albie
Varoski, who defeated Stan Cocke,
who beat Varoski last year.
Davidson suffered its only loss at
the number one doubles position.

On Saturday, the ‘Cats came up
witha big win over Big Southrival
Coastal Carolina. Davidson dem-
onstrated its great depth by com-

ing up with victories in the bottom
four singles slots. Holt Vaughan,
Dave Tonidandel and Chris Parker
allrallied to win three-set matches.

Frank was once again pleased

with the play of freshmen Vaughan
and Daniel Grinnan, who won at
three and four singles respectively.
“The way our team works we must

Spohomore Russel Briggs .

get wins from our three and four
playersin order to win,” said Frank.
Frank was happy not only with
the comebacks in singles, but also
with the team’s doubles play. The
‘Cats responded to Frank’s mid-
week meeting that emphasized the
importance of doubles to the team.
The ‘Cats went into the match
trying to play aggressively at the
net to take advantage of the two
baselining Swedish players in the
Chanticleers’ lineuf. “"
Russell Briggs and Dale Voeks
especially took Frank’s message
to heart, winning the firstten games
of the match en route to a 6-0, 6-2
victory at number two doubles.
Beyer and Vaughan also rallied
from their loss on Friday to over-
comea 5-2 deficit in the third set to

for the remainder of the game. As
a result, the Rams were forced to
play most of the game with their
starters.

The Wildcats held VCU 2©1
inthe second half, and were able to
walk off the field with their heads
up. The Richmond game was more
of a disappointment for Davidson
after having an excellent turf game
because they were held scoreless.
The Wildcats were unable to sus-
tain a decisively long offensive
surge until the second half. They
had several breakaway attempts
by Ukrop and junior Simone
Plaisance, but
Richmond’s defense thrawtedeach
attempt. The Wildcats allowed
three goals.

In need of a win the Wildcats
preyed upon their next opponent
High Pointon the following Thurs-
day. Davidsonended their scoring
drought by racking up six goals.
They took control from the open-

ing whistle with a corner attempt '

in the first fifteen seconds. Russ
and Ukrop each scored in the first
half.

More goals followed in the
second half as Meg Miller scored
her<h<first and second goals of her
career and was inches away from a

force a tiebreaker. The ‘Cats won
the tiebreaker to sweep the doubles.

Frank sees the success the Wild-
cats have been having this fall in
his players
attitudes.
“We went
out with
confidence
on Satur-
day, espe-
cially in
t h e
doubles,”
said Frank.
“We have
gone into
t h oe
doubles
leading 4-2
before, and
lost, but the
players
were deter-
mined not
to let that happen this time.”

The ‘Cats turned in another strong
performance on Sunday, defeating
William and Mary (9-3). Varoski
suffered one of the few three set
losses of the weekend for Davidson,
falling 7-5 in the third. In what
Frank called the best match of the
weekend Tonidandel pulled out an
incredible comeback victory. Af-
ter winning the first set Tonidan-
del lost the second set and found
himself down 5-1 in the third.
Tonidandel’s serve then turned into
a weapon and he forced a
tiebreaker. In the tiebreaker,
Tonidandel held five match points
before winning the tiebreaker 16-
14, for the win. ;

The Wildcats will be in action at
home on Thursday, with a match
against Queens, ~

hat trick. Then the “FRESHMEN
CONNECTION” came alive.
Freshmen Missy Potts and Nancy
Hilles each scored off deflections.
Andrea Short and Robin Pepper
had strong shot attempts on goal
and were supported by Megan
Snyder at right halfback.

Freshmen goalie Mary
Ferguson sealed the victory with a
shutout. - Sophomore Jesse Col-
trane said, “The second half was a
better reflection of our passing
game because we were more
composed and theenergy level was
really high.”

The Wildcats lost a heart-
breaker to Catawba in the next
week on a last second shot. Even
though Davidson had over twenty-
five shots on goal, they were un-
able to score. Ukrop had a reverse
stick deflection off a pass from
Hardesty, but the goal was called
back. Catawba will travel to
Davidson on Homecoming week-
end, and the Wildcats are planning
an unfriendly homecoming for
them.

Davidson earned ahard fought
victory against Wake Forest by
defeating the Demon Deacons 1-0
in a sudden death overtime. This
game was of the utmost of impor-

tance because the victor would be
the number one seed at the Deep
South Tournament. Davidson had
beaten Wake three previous times
yet was considered the underdog
playing on their field.

The Wildcats were inches away
from taking a 1-0 lead in the sec-
ond half when a goal by junior
Monique Dockter was disallowed.
The game remained scoreless
through regulation play and was
forced into an overtime then a
‘sudden death overtime. Freshman
Missy Pottsended the scoring stale-
mate with a goal from ten yards
out. She slammed the ball in ona
gorgeous cross the field pass by
senior Lauren Follmer, who was
credited with the assist.

After the goal, Potts was tack-
led by the Wildcats and carrried
off the field by her teammates.
Again the shutout was preserved
by goalie Emily Coleman. T his

_.game was also a memorable game
for Coach Pryor because it was her

first game of the season.as coach-
ing the Wildcats since her preg-
nancy.

Davidson’s next game is
against Catawba on Friday at 4:30
and Radford on Saturday at 3:00.

ACC Football: It Sucks

By Bruce Balestier
I’ve had about enough of the hype that the ACC is a good football

conference; it’s not. Let’s take a look at some recent results. Saturday,
Georgia Tech, previously touted as a possible repeat national champion,
lost 23-14 toa poor South Carolina team, the one that tied Duke. There’s
a little credo one can utilize when dealing with ACC football: when an
ACC team plays a good team, they almost always lose. Witness Tech’s
convincing loss at the hands of mediocre Penn State. Witness Clemson’s
pummeling at the hands of Georgia, the same Georgia that Saturday lost
to Vanderbilt.

And how about North Carolina. They entered the top 25 on the
strength ofa win over Cincinnati (remember Penn State 81 Cincinnati0),
then gave up 36 points to I-AA William and Mary, as rather eloquent
proof that they didn’t belong. N.C. State then made the top 25 by beating
Carolina, and moved up to #11 by nipping Tech. Saturday, they needed
two touchdowns in the final three minutes to beat I- AA Marshall of the
Southern Conference 15-14. How weak is that? Still, though, they are
undefeated, and if they beat Clemson next week it will be a straight shot
into the Florida Citrus Bowl. Maybe, like Georgia Tech did last year,
they will beat some highly-ranked team that is supposed to be good,.and
the pollsters will decide to hook a team that is actually deserving of the
title.

It seems ridiculous to think that Florida State could enter a bowl
game with 1 loss (say, to Florida) but ranked #1, beat a good team and
not get the title, But then I think back to last year. Colorado played
arguably the toughest schedule in the land, was ranked #1 and beat a very
good Notre Dame team in the Orange Bowl, but lost out to Tech inthe
UPI poll. Tech, meanwhile, had gone through that rigorous ACC sched-
ule withouta loss (justa tie with that powerhouse North Carolina Squad).

Then they beat a Nebraska team in the Florida Citrus Bowl that
hadn’t beaten a ranked opponent in three years. It seems odd that the
combination of a weak schedule and a bow! win over a good, but not very
good, team would be a formula for the national championship, but
apparently it is. Georgia Tech was a very good team, top 10 perhaps, but
#1 they were not. The prospect of N.C. State doing something similar this
year makes me want to scratch my eyes out.
