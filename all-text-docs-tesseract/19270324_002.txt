The announcement by Captain MeCutch-
of the tennis team, of the Northern
trip to be taken -by the racqueteers this spring
has greeted with interest and many
praiseworthy remarks. Despite the fact of
Carr's injury that may keep him from the
courts this spring ,the hopes of the members
of the squad are high. The annual spring
tournament is now in the process of being
run off to determine the members of the
team who will go North to represent David
son. With Carr out of the game, it is prob-
able that McCutcheon, Roddey and McAI-
pine will land berths on the team and the
fourth position is left undecided. Just who
the number four player will be is yet a mat-
ter of doubt. Alexander, Christian, Flowe,

tremely dark.

With the opening of track season only a
matter of a few days away, we expect to
hear any moment of some disaster befallen
Captain Goodykoontz. For the last four. or
five years the track captain here has become
incapacitated before the was out.
Stribeck, Gracey, Anderson, all suffered in
some way or other from a malady that
could not be cured while track season lasted.

It is true that “Goody” hurt his ankle last |

rumors have reached us.

Besides the captain, Kell and Currie and
perhaps Pinkney will participate in the
dashes. Sims, letter man, and Brown, are

the best bets in the hurdles, and Brown will |

possibly get a shot at the javelin. The Cal-
houn brothers can easily take care of the
high jumping pit and Jennings, supported by
Baily or Fry, will vault. It is possible that
Fry may be run in the low hurdles. Bohan-
non and Lincoln and Leftwich are the most

likely weight men. In the middle distances |

O'Neal, and in the longer races, Treveton
and Martin, will probably get the call. Mel-
ton is showing excellent form in several
eyents and no doubt will get into the meet
in some capacity, more than likely the broad
jump.

Don Wharton w ent to Brown’s
restaurant and ordered oysters. “Let me
have them raw,” he said, “and not too

‘large nor too small. I want them salty
and soft, and they must be cold. Make
it snappy, I’m ina hurry.”

“Would you like them with or without
pearls?” dryly inquired the waiter.

“But,” protested the new arrival as St.
Peter handed him a golden saxaphone,
“I can’t play this. I never practiced

“Of course you didn’t,” chuckled the
old Saint, “that’s why you arc here.”

school years, is beneficial to a large extent

only if carried on and used later in the real

Wildcats’ Track Season

Meet at Blacksburg to Pry Off Lid
For Both Teams

Davidsonggpens its auspicious track sched-
ule for this Season next Saturday afternoon
at Blacksburg, Va., when the Virginia Poly-
technic Institute will be met on the home
grounds of the latter institution, This will
be the initial niéet for both Davidson and
V. P. IL. and because it is the first contest ,
of the season, neither team will be in par
condition.

The Wildcats will leave here Friday morn-
ing in cars for the seat of the Virginia in-
stitution. Eighteen men will make the trip,
in addition to Coach Tex Tilson and Man
ager Jim King. The track coach was unable
to name those men who would go to Blacks-
burg Monday night, since their work on the
field the remainder of this week will largely
determine who the contestants will be.

It is reported that V. P. I. have excep-
tionally good men in the 220-yard dash, 440-
yard race, mile-run and discus throw. Since
Davidson has some strong men in the dashes,
it is expected that these races will be among
the best of the affair.

many of the present ‘student body that the
Virginia Gobblers walked away from the
Wildcats that year, and if their strength
is anything like it was then, the Davidson
outfit will have a difficult time to make an
appreciable showing. Davidson's strength
has materially increased, however, and the
outcome will determine the possibilities of
the entire season for the Wildcats.

In order to add variety to the program,

Baseball Season Opens

Friday With Cadet Game

Strong Oak Ridge Team to Play
Games Here Friday and
Saturday

With the coming of the Oak Rdige Prep-
aratory School here Friday, Davidson offi-
cially opens the 1927 baseball season. For
a number ‘“6f years it has been the custom
for Davidson and Oak Ridge to inaugurate
their respective season with a series of two
games with each other.

Oak Ridge has one of the strongest prep
school nines in the entire South, and it is
the equal, if not the better of several South-
ern colleges.<In the history of the two
schools’ baseball affiliations, it is a matter
of rare occurrence for one of the schools to
win both games.

The final line-up has not been selected as
yet, but it appears that the team will be out
on the diamond as follows: Catcher, “Wick”
Black; pitchers, Wells, Cathey, and Mea-
1 dows, with Wells possibly being shifted to
the outfield; second base, John Kugler; first
base, Kelly Woodham, captain of the team;
third base, Johnny Dulin; short stop, Fritz
Littlejohn; left field, Ratchford; center
field, Hal Johnson; right field, Davis, Mc-
Connell, or Wells.

On paper the team looks strong with the
battery the weakest. Although the team is
not perfect all its parts, the
games Friday and Saturday will probably do
much toward determining the real strength
of the team and their ability to work to-
gether as a unit.
