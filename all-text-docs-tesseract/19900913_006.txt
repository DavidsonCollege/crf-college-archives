THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

Hairy Legs, California and
Proud of It

I love not shaving my legs at
Davidson. The stereotypes sur-
rounding the “hairy mentality” are
fun to disprove. It is similar to
being a Californian on a campus
full of people whose only expo-
sure to the state is through movies
and television. Those of us who are
neither Yankees nor Southerners,
don’t know exactly what the Con-
federate flag looks like, much less
what it means, and have enjoyed
avocadocs since tecthing have been
spoon-fed misconceptions about
the South rivalled only by the mis-
conceptions dished out regarding
our own state.

Usually when people think of
California they come up with one
of two pictures. Eitherancnormous
neon and pavement strip full of
confused plastic people crawling
the malls in search of the perfect
ensemble to wear to their next
therapy or studio meeting Icaps to
mind, or a tan, blonde, granola-
munching surfer dude lighting up
a joint in a redwood hot tub floats
before the eyes. Somchow, all of
the images are on roller skates.
Usually we’ re freaked out (or, like,
totally chilled) about the latest
carthquake, which we discuss in
detail while lying out cultivating
the kind of tan to make The Beach
Boys swoon.

I get even more confused
glances because I grew up near
San Francisco. I’ma dyke, right?

Aren’t all Those Kind of People
activists, On one-person Crusades
to change the world (like mc)?
Aren’t all assertive women who
rcfuse to be embarrassed by locker
room humor and pinch back when
grabbed by drunk men man-hating
lesbians who took a wrong turn on
their way to Smith College and
accidentally landed down ata party
on Patterson Court?

Fuzzy legs, my statchood, and
the fact that I refuse to eat the flesh
ofanimals raised in the confines of
agribusiness intcrests make me a
little less than average around here.
I am definitely not complaining.
What most people don’t realize is
that I enjoy constantly having my
regional prejudices proved wrong.
And I enjoy even more changing
other people’s perceptions.

My not shaving has very little
to do with High Ideals and a lot to
do with Laziness. I do belicve that
a woman has the right to look how
she pleascs without the need for
outside, male conformation of
beauty, but I also belicve thatusing
not shaving as an instrument of
intense sclf-assertion is a bit of a
cop-out.

When I start asserting people
will know, whether my legs are
hairy or not. ButI kind of like hairy
legs. Sol don’tshave.1 know some
women who find them totally gross.
So they shave. Big deal. They feel
good about themselves, I feel good

about myself, and everybody is
happy. —

The California thing is equally
casual. Other than being spoiled
by a ready supply of garlic and
aruchokes every summer (they arc
the main agricultural products of
the farms in the arcas surrounding
my hometown), I grew up simi-
larly to most of my East Coast
friends. Granted, we have a lot
more traffic, immigration, smog,
political parties, and successful
baseball teams than our national
counterparts, but I didn’t try tofu
until I went to college, either.

If anybody had mentioned
“The South” to me two years ago I
would have pictured muscular
rednecks cruising around in jacked-
up pickups chewing tobacco and
wearing overalls.

What a pleasant surprise to be
surrounded by well-educated,
open-minded people in Duck pants
who consistently use the multi-
purpose word “y’all” outside of
Latin class (as in, “Y’all will con-
quer Gaul”), without being self-
conscious.

Sure, I’ve met some rednecks,
and plastic people and surfer dudes
went to my high school, but my
“out-of-state experience” has al-
lowed me to value the complexi-
ties inherent in a nation populated
with so many different kinds of
people, holding lots of wrong ideas
about everyone clse’s lifestyle.

Icast the rest of the term.)

3) Flattery works.

4) The English department has,
without qucstion, the coolest pro-
fcssors. (See number 3)

5) Cheesy pickup lines actually
work at court parties, as anyone

who’s ever said “Golly, this warm

Busch beer is really lousy, I’ve got
some longnecks up in my room”
will tell you.

6) Dirty jokes, however, don’t. (i.e.

Spare yourself the embarrassment
by holding back the rather obvious
lines about warm Busch and long-
necks.)

7) Popping ‘round Dr. Kuyuken-
dall’s house for cocktails at 3.a.m.
ona wecknight will get youa great

feputation withthe Davidson

administration, espccially if it’s
right before the Trustce’s Week-
end. }

8) It is perfectly acceptable for

Students to “borrow” a Cushman
from the public safety office when
younced to make alate nightrunto
the Union for smokes. (Trust me,
the police don’t mind a bit.)

9) Nothing impresses senior
women at Davidson more than

when drunk freshmen guysturnup—

uninvited at their apartment in
search of play.

10) Never call your female profes-
sors “honey”.

The Middle East

extraneous element in the present
crisis. In fact these conflicts lie, as
Isee it, at the heart of all the devel-
opments in the Middle East.

The West has been drawn into
yet another dilemma as a result of
ethnocentricity and ignorance.
People have never felt the need to
Icarn about the Middle East be-
cause the pro-Isracli groups in the
US have taken care of that: Arabs
are “barbarians”, ’fanatics” and
“terrorists”, and Israel, with the
help of the US, is working to teach
ushow tobe “civilized” and demo-
cratic people.

Of course it is not uncivilized
and undemocratic to intervene in
the affairs of South and Central
Amcricaand prop up dictators like
Chile’s Pinochet and use force to
remove others like Noriega. Or to
support apartheid in South Africa
by selling the “democratic” gov-
emment arms, or to back, cco-
nomically and militarily, the Marx-
ist regime of Licutenant Colonel
Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethio-
pia.

But at Icast in these cases the
American people sympathize with
and support the common people in
their struggle against injustice. This
is not the case with the common
people in the Middle East; they are
victims, blamed by the entire world
for the actions and words of a few
power hungry leaders like Saddam
Hussein. .

‘Saddam Hussein does not care
that his actions are going to lead to
more suffering by Arab people all
over the world. He could care less
about the evils being committed
against Arab-Americans in the
United States. These Arabs left
their countrics only to have their
lives threatened, their houses
damaged, their car tires slashed,
and worst of all, their children al-
ienated in school. But that is al-
right because their brothers and
sisters at home have had to live
through worse economic and so-
cial injustices.

Now they might have to live
through yet another war so that

Americans can continue to prosper
on their behalf. The Arab people
would not want that. It would
mean Americans would have to
live more like they do. It would
also mean that the United States
would not be able to give Isracl
enough money to commit more
violence against us.

Big Brother (Uncle Sam), who
has always prided himself on lis-
tening to the people, did not give
the Arabsachance tocomeup with
a diplomatic solution, and entered
aregion where He is not well liked
(I wonder why) and where the form

of governmentis one which He has
always denounced.

Somchow all those cherished
democratic values seem to disap-
pear when His economic interests
are at stake. Thomas Friedman put
itso well when he said, “In the last
50 years the United States, what-
ever its oratory, has tended to
support democracy when it serves
the interests of stability and to back
away from insisting on it when it
could de-stabilize an arca of na-
tional intercst...TO expect the
United States to begin promoting
democracy in the Arab world may
be a bit too much to ask.” (New
York Times, “Curiously, a Dicta-
or...”, September 2,1990) —

I fecl the Arab leaders could
have resolved this problem

amongst cach other, and it could
_ have possibly led to some real re-

forms inthe Arab world. Butwhen
the United States decided to move
a quartcr of a million troops into
the area, Saddam Hussein’ knew
that this would be just the thing to
mobilize the masses behind him.

If you were one of those farm-
ersin Shaqra, what would you do if
you had a choice between Saddam
Hussein, who is telling you that he
is willing to rid you of Israel’s
belligerence, or the United States,
who has, for as long as you can
remember, supported Israel eco-
nomically and militarily? I think
the answer is obvious,

The point is that America, by
reverting to military action, has
destroyed the possibility of a-dip-
Jomatic solution. Once those troops
landed in Saudi Arabia, the com-
mon Arab citizens took a position
which opposed the position their
respective governments had taken.

So in the ensuing weeks of this
crisis put yourself in the place of
that farmer and see and hear things
as he would. Put yourself in the
place of Mohammed El Amine, an
Arab-American who is there to
support the United States in a war
against his brothers and sisters.

Most importantly, I urge you

effects of colonialism. Learnabout
our literature, art and music, our
flowery language where when you
grect one another you say “al
salamu alaikum” (may peace be
upon you) and the other replies -

“wa alaikum al salam” (and also
upon you). I hope someone can
convince the American govern-
menttolisten tothe commonpeople

so that such a grocting besncsany a
reality.
