DR. J. M. DOUGLAS
GIVES INTERESTING TALK

At the “Y" vesper service Sunday
evening. Dr. J. M. Douglas made a very
interesting and instructive talk on “The
Greatness of God.” ‘The meditative
praise of God as shown in Psalm 19 was
explained in terms of modern inventions
and discoveries,

“The question as to whether there is
a God has been brought up many times,
but the fact that the first few chapters
of ‘Genesis have never been accepted by
the world as false, shows that there is a
God.” said Dr. Douglas.

Modern science and invention — was
brought to bear on the greatness of God
in creating the universe. As the universe
is infinite, so is the greatness of God.
Another striking illustration of the
greatness of God was made, showing
God's greatness in small things as well
as in large. The electron was used to
show this..

“The works of God are all perfect,”
continued Dr. Douglas, “in the smallest
as well as the largest of His creations.”

In closing he said “Thus relizing the
greatness of God, His name should be
mentioned only in reverence, and to
pratse and glorify Him.”

At the close of the meeting it was an-
nounced that the annual election of off-
cers of the Y. M. C. A. would be held
next Sunday night at the regular mect-
ing.

WHAT ARE YOU WORTH?

From your chin down you are worth
a dollar and a half a day. From the
chin up you are worth—anything.
There's no limit. Without your head-
piece you are just an animal, and about
as valuable as a horse—maybe.

You have a mistaken idea. You think
you are paid for your work. You are
not. You are paid for what you think
while you work. It’s the kind of brain
that directs your hands that gives you
rating. . .

Where do you Ret your pleasures?
From the chin down? Is it all dancing
for your feet, and meat for your stomach
and clothes for your back? And—is all
vour fun in the cellar. Don’t you ever
have any fun in the attic? . . —Ex.

THE WAY TO WIN.

If vou think you are beaten, you are;
If you think you dare not. you don't,
If you'd like to win but think you can't
It’s almost a cinch you wont.
If you think you'll lose, you're lost,
For out of the world we find .
Success begins with a fellow’s will—
It’s all in the state of mind.
If you think vou're outclassed. vou are:
You've got to think high to rise.
You've got to be sure of yourself before
You can ever win a prize.
Life's battles don’t always go
To the stronger or faster man:
But soon or late the man who wins
Is the one who thinks he can.
—S. M. McGill.
