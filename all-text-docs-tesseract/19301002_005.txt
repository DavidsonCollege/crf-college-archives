It seems that the Davidson Band is about
to get into full swing now, after its organ-
ization shortly after school opened. The band
has high hopes of making this the most pros-
perous year of its existence.

At the opening of the year, about  fifty-
four musicians reported to try out for the
band. However, it was necessary to reduce
this number to thirty-six jand it now seems
that this number will again be decreased to
thirty. They uniformity

The band attended the Davidson-N. C.
State game in Greensboro on Saturday
night, September 27, participating in* the

parade which took place in the late after-
noon. The State Band was also in this pa-
rade. In both parade and game, the band
showed evidences of talent, and also of con-
stant training under the direction of its offi-
cers, R. D. Russell, captain of the band,
Professor Cullum,

and it is hoped that it will he able to attend
practically all the foothall games in which
the team will take part this season. Great
interest is being manifested by each individ-

ing a greater number from which to select
the choice musicians. It is also hoped that
the band may he enlarged as soon as addi-
tional uniforms may be obtained to atcom-

24 yards to N. C. State’s nine-yard line. At

this stage Coach Van Liew, new State men- |

to stay the march of the Wildcats. After
three line plunges had failed, Captain Fraley
tossed a short pass directly over the line of

of the game. Brock again failed to make good

bears testimony. Both teams offered a fast,
hard-charging forward wall that frequently
smeared plays before they could get started.
The punting of Thad Brock deserves spe-
cial mention, for even though rushed by the
big Wolfpack line, he got off beautiful and
consistent kicks.

Ark.—(IP)*-Two co-eds at
the Arkansas State College here, who hap-.

United States Civil Service Department a
perplexing problem, which was ironed out

only when the co-eds’ professors came to
their support

The twins, Letha and Leton Adams, took
a civil service examination.

When their papers were graded there came
back from Unele Sam a letter, stating that
there was “obvious evidence of copying in
the examination papers,” and that the twins
were barred forever from again taking a
civil service examination.

The girls reported the matter to college
authorities, who immediately filed a protest
with the civil service authorities. Their pro-
fessors reported that there was not a pos-
sible chance that the girls had not played
fair,

The instructors said that the girls’ minds
just naturally run in the same channels;
that as one thinks, the other thinks. In
said, the girls
turn in almost identical papers.

Therefore,

it was contended, Uncle Sam
shouldn't bar the twins just because they
think alike.

Football Programs

The Athletic Association will pub-
lish programs this fall for five of
Davidson’s most important football
games. This work will be super-
vised by Ernest Milton, the Alumni
Secretary, who plans to issue them
at games the Wildcats will play
with Citadel, V. P. 1., Wofford, Car-
olina, and Wake Forest.

These programs, modeled after
one issued in 1928, will be» about
twenty pages in length. Full infor-
mation about each contest will be
given. Pictures of Davidson men
and members of the opposing team
will appear in each issue with a
complete lineup, giving players’
positions, numbers, and weights. A
list of the results of previous en-
gagements between the two teams
will also be included. Advertise-
ments are expected to be a great
financial aid in these publications.
