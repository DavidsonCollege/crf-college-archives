THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 16, 1930

Oberlin College to
Study World Peace

Students of Presbyterian College in
Ohio Inspired by Address of
President

Oberlin, Ohio—More than seven hundred
Oberlin College undergraduates have formed
the Oberlin Peace Society, an organization
which evolved from a chapel address made
by Dr. Ernest Hatch Wilkins, president of
the college, and one which the student lead-
ers hope will spread, in one form or another,
to all the colleges and universities of the
country.

Many of the students who joined the so-
ciety pledged themselves to do special re-
search work in problems of peace and war
in an effort to arrive at an intelligent solu-
tion of the problem.

The address which inspired the formation
of the society was one in which President
Wilkins expressed the belief that colleges
ought to make the study of peace one of
their main subjects.

Warning the students that this generation,
although due the credit for starting the
movement for world peace, will never see
the culmination of their work, Dr. Wilkins
continued :

“T have imagined that for a period of
seven years Oberlin might devote itself to an
intensive study of this problem—elementary
work in all departments to continue in the
normal way, advanced work in all or nearly
all departments to concentrate very largely
on the common theme. Thus the department
of history would study the sheer facts of
war; the departments of social science would
study the causes of war and their correction ;
the departments of literature would deal with
those works which set forth the experience
of war as seen by men of genius who have
shared in it; the departments of physics and
chemistry would study the implications of
physical and chemical warfare, and the de-
partments of biology the implications of that
bacteriological warfare which is all too pos-
sible; and the other departments would study
the actual effects of war upon the body and
the mind and the spirit of men.

“A monotonous and a ghastly program,
you say? Yes, but less monotonous than the
trenches; less ghastly than a city
where a bomb has fallen.”

Literary Societies Have
Good Programs Planned

Professor Williams to Talk at Eu-|

manean—Davidson Traditions

to be Discussed at Phi

The Eumanean and the Philanthropic Lit-

erary Societies have arranged two very in- |

teresting programs for their meetings to be
held on Tuesday night, October 21.

At Eu hall, Professor John P. Williams |
will speak on the subject, “Business of To- |

day,” and M. W. Norfleet will discuss “The
Importance of the Essentials of Parliamen-
tary Law.”
very interesting and comprehensive talk on
the different phases of business, including
his interpretation of the present business de-
pression and a clarifying discussion on the
stock market. The business administration
head has a keen insight on financial problems
and will probably explain many of the intri-
cacies of Wall Street, which he knows thor-
oughly. Norfleet is well versed in rules of
formal procedure and will offer many _in-
structive hints to literary society partici-
pants.

The program at the Phi hall includes four
talks by students: “The Early History of
Davidson,” by Jack Mathews; “The Story of
the Davidson Seal,” A,
Story of the Chandelier,” R. D. Russel;
and “The Stories Told Concerning the Col-
umns of Old Chambers,” M, F. McDavid.
Few subjects can be found more interesting
to students than these, dealfag with the tra-
ditions of Old Davidson.

Students Selected
To Lead at Chapel

For the past two years it has been the
custom for the students to lead the chapel
exercises alternating with the members of
the faculty.

Beginning October 14th, the following stu-
dents will lead the chapel exercises :

October 14th—R. D. Russel

October 16th—Bill Flenn

October 18th—Jack Mathews

October 20th—Archie McLean

October 22nd—Jas. A. Jones

No arrangements have yet been made for
the remainder of the year, but the students
will continue alternating with the members
of the faculty in carrying on these exercises.

| Annual Pictures

Out of two hundred and sixty photographs
| taken by the Annual photographer, one hun-
| dred and sixty-two proofs have been re-
|turned. The majority of these proofs have
| been good, so it seems that greater satisfac-
| tion will be given this year.

Everyone is urged to have their picture
taken when the photographer returns here,
about November 1, so that if they are not
satisfied the pictures may be taken again in
time to get in the Annual.
| On his next trip the photographer will
|take pictures of some of the groups, the
others to be taken later.

Johnson and Watts at guards. The most

moved Oglesby over to this position, but
against V. M. I. Cantrell started in the
pivot position. The veteran backfield of Wil-
