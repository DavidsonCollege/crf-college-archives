Senior parents out of luck in lodging
NASCAR drives out relatives on graduation weekend

Your parents may not have to
sleep in a manger, but they may
feel like Joseph and Mary when
there is no room at the inn for
graduation this year. Thoughroom
reservations are notoriously diffi-
cult to secure by the August pre-
ceding the academic year, many
seniors’ families’ complications
were compounded by the simulta-
neous scheduling of the NASCAR
Winston Select at the Charlotte
Motor Speedway the same week-
end.

“[My mom] had to make a lot
of calls, but they did finally get a

room,” says senior Kerry Albright.

For graduation, rooms “‘go re-
ally fast,” says Cornelius Comfort
Inn front desk agent Travis Collum.
“Normally, we take reservations
51 weeks in advance. In about four
weeks we were booked up for the
weekend of May 16-18.”

Conflicts with the racing cir-
cuit are nothing new to Sara
Messick, who works at the Hamp-
ton Inn’s front desk in Cornelius.
Parents’ Weekend poses a similar
dilemma, she said. “Racing is a
big problem around here, espe-

cially being so close to a school,” .

says Messick. “We do it as fairly
as possible. It’s first come, first
serve.”

Yet, even though this is not
the first year that this particular

schedule conflict has arisen,
chances for compromise are slim.
Vice Chairman Pro-tem of the Fac-
ulty Robert Manning laughs when
faced with the prospect of chang-

ing graduation dates for the

NASCAR calendar. The academic
calendar is set by faculty vote.
“We're stuck by faculty rules,”
says Manning.

“We try to have a three-week
winter vacation. We must have 14
weeks in the semester. We have a
week for spring break, five op-
tional class days, a certain number
of exam days and a reading day.
There are so many considerations
that you can’t change one date and
not have it affect all the others,”
Manning says.

Foul play:

Serial defecator messes with campus

conference for the Presbyterian
Men’s Synod, Adams was called
by a retired minister to room A of
MCF 101 in order to investigate “a
big pile of stuff in the middle of the
floor. Sure enough, the Unacrapper
had struck again. It was huge.” The
visitors were moved to another
apartment, and the carpet was sham-
pooed several times.

Seniors Mattison Ward and
Kris Horrocks first thought that their
discovery had been left by an ani-
mal; however, after hearing other
stories and realizing that “‘most ani-
mals don’t use couches,” their sus-
picions changed. “It must have
been him. It would have taken an
animal some serious talent,”
Horrocks insisted.

After persistent efforts of the
Physical Plant and the Davidson
College Police Department to find
the offender — including the use of
time-lapse video — suspicions nar-
rowed to “a student who was hav-
ing problems near the end of last
year,” Lt. David MacLaurin,
Davidson College Detective, said,
“It was obvious that this individual
had some deep-seeded mental prob-
lems. We took him to Mental Health
in Charlotte, where his parents came
and got him. We haven’t had any

According to Bob Collins,
Director of the Physical Plant, the
first in a series of peculiar inci-
dents happened last semester be-
fore spring exams. Since then,
there have been at least five addi-
tional occurrences of vandalism
involving human feces.

The defacement began in
Chambers, in Love. Auditorium
and then later in the first floor
men’s bathroom, where mainte-
nance workers found feces
smeared and thrown on the walls
and ceiling. Collins said that al-
though the problem stopped when
students left for the summer, it
began again when summer em-
ployees: returned to on-campus
housing.

According to senior Trey
Adams, who worked as a Summer
Conference Assistant on campus,
soilings peaked in mid- to late
July and seemed to focus around
the senior apartments. Adams’
first-hand experience came when
he was making routine inspec-
tions of apartments before camp-
ers were to move in: “I walked
into Ryburn 302, and there was

this horrible odor. I was be- _ problems since.” Because no for-
fuddled.” mal charges were made, no names
Aftercheckingthebathrooms can be released; MacLaurin does

not know whether the student has
returned to school this fall.

Despite his certainty in the
identity, MacLaurin believes that
the Ryburn foulings were the work
of acopycat artist, probably a “dis-
gruntled former employee.”

There have been no recent

and finding nothing apparent in
any of the rooms, Adams called
Housekeeping for help. After a
long search, they discovered that
the culprit had “done his business
under each blanket” of each bed.
Sheets and mattresses have been
replaced.

New alcohol policy tests Rusk and Connor: BYOB or cans?

from page |

However, houses can have less
parties with cans due to the ex-
pense.
PCC members are working on
solutions. As of now, none of them
are sure what Patterson Court will
be like this year.

Molly McGehee, President of
Connor, said: “The party we spon-
sored on Friday night with Phi
Delta Theta was a test run of one
way of adapting to this policy.”
She added, “We needed to see
where the kinks were and what
work lies ahead for us and the other

houses.” Phi Delt President Mike
Ingram said he planned to “see
how [Friday night’s] party went
and revise if need be.”
Comments from Connor
show that revision may be neces-
sary. Senior Social members com-
mented, “The BYOB party was

Another Senior Connor
woman added, “It’s frustrating
because the administration gave
us a policy but didn’ t tell us how to
implement it.”

First impressions of the revised Patterson Court

Connor: “A lot of people brought in glass [which is illegal] and beer they
didn’t register at the front door, because the back doors and windows were
open. [The new party format] is more confusing. There’s so many rules to
remember that people are going to be breaking them, not even consciously.”
- Vidalia Scrivano ’97 :

Rusk: “I liked it — it was like the good old days when I first joined Rusk.
There were so many more people there. Whether it was the house or the
alcohol, I don’t know, but it was a great night.”

Rusk: “It was better than last year. [You didn’t] have to sneak in the back if
you didn't have a PCC sticker.” - Dan Duncan ’97
