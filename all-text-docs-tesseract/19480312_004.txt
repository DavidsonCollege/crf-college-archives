The Phi Gams breezed to a
smashing triumph in the annual in-
terfraternity track meet by accumu-
lating a total of 37 points to far
outdistance their nearest rivals, the
SAE’s whose total read 27. Mainly
responsible for this overwhelming
victory was the combined efforts of
two fleet lads, Ed Newton and
Tommy Haller, who between them
accounted for 26 of the Phi Gam
total. Newton won the 100-yard
dash in 10.4, and then proceeded to
break his own record in the 220 by
running it in the record-smashing
time of 23.4. Newton also ran
anchor man on the winning Phi
Gam relay team which tied the
record set in 1939 of 1:41,

Phi Gams Win Six.

Adding, victories in the 440,
hurdles, high jump, and relay to
Newton's feats, the . Phi “Gams
amassed six events as they simply
ran away with the proceedings.

much. Russell placed first in the
discus with a toss of 115.3. Russell
also ran second to Newton in the
100 and 220 races. These points,
coupled with J. D. Ashmore’s
triumph in the 660 gave the SAE’S
second place in preference to the
to the Phi Delts who were hot on
their trails with 26 points. The Kap-
pa Sigs, showing Evans in the shot
put and discus came in fourth with
a total of 21, while the excellent
performance of Bob Flower*in the
three-quarter mile enabled the
K. A.s to hold down fifth place
with a total of 18 points.

Tommy ‘Haller was the -leading
scorer in this year’s meet, supplant-

as high man. Tommy accounted for
15 points via his first places in the
hurdles and high jump and second
in the broad jump. Newton, of
course, won both his races in
