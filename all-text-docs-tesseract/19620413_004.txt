Silverstein’s Concert:
Tale Of An Arty Ghetto

BY BILL TROTTER
Davidsonian Fine Arts Critic
The people are rather nice, once you get to meet them. There is something es-
sentially fine about them, and there is a spirit to them that is strangely absent on
this campus, where the keynote seems to be all work and no learning.
There is an excitement—but it is an excitement mixed with no slight amount of

Hocsak American Dreams

BY DAVE PUSEY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Every year Davidsonians are more than casually interested in the project to be
supported, through the YMCA Gift Fund, by their hard-earned, and equally hard-
given, dollars. But few Gift Funds have created a stir to match that of 1956, when
students voted to support a project which would bring to Davidson an Hungarian
refugee family.

This was the period of revolt
and mass escapes in the Red-
ridden satellite country, and a
chance to help a refugee family
begin life anew. ih _ history's

Strangely enough, the people in the Ghetto are rather happy about being there. They

or left suspended, maybe to be
picked-up again, maybe to be
left for more exciting ones. The
idea takes shape, a feeling that
is honest and quite true—that
the artist has found in these
people, something which he re-
spects, a knowledge and a criti-
cal worth which he responds to
-he would have excused him-
self politely long before now if
there were not.

BIDS FAREWELL

There was a slight wait for
the violinist and his accom-
paniest to come over from

gins
| the auditorium. The coffee

For over an hour they stand
there, the formality drops fur-
ther and further into the
background; you discover the
artist as a man with his own
conversational technique, his
own opinions, a shrewd and
sensitive observer of conduct-
ors and musicians, who will
hurl out his opinion at you
and expect you to hurl yours
back at him with equal force
and conviction; this compos-
er is a dead issue — no, a very
much alive one; this conduc-
tor can’t lead a dance band—
no, he is a great musician;
such a symphony is hair-rais-
ing—no, it’s a banal piece of
garbage. . . The hours slip
by, the homework piled on the
desk is forgotten—its value
beside a vital and stimulating
discussion like this is negli-
gible.

Such discussions have a life
and pattern all their own—peo-
ple drift in and out to throw in
perhaps only a single sentence,
but that sentence may send the
talk flying into new areas, ideas,

had already begun to flow,
the cinnamon = crunchies
brought out by the Union
were already staining the
lapels with powdered sugar.
The people who had come
over had a moment to collect
themselves, discuss the con-
cert, form perhaps some of
the questions they might want
| to ask the artist.

And when he finally has to go,
he shakes his head smilingly,
and in a tone of one who has
enjoyed a good argument and
has enjoyed expressing himself,
“Well, I hadn't planned to get
into an argument with real
musical sophisticates out here
in this part of the country.” And
it makes you feel good. And, if
you've got eyes and ears, you
know damned well what he
means by “this part of the coun-

| CANDID CONVERSATION

When Mr. Silverstein came in,
| the gathering became at once a
| close and free affair which need
not feel ashamed or provincial
to any artistic function any-
where in this country, at any
college. There is to artistic, par-
ticularly musical, sessions like
this, a spontaneity and flow
that is truly amazing. In sec-
onds, the soloist was answering
questions, offering opinions, on
a wide variety of questions.
There is a common joy and de-
light that is indeed rare when
something like this happens—
it stems partially from the re-
warding experience of talking to
an artist as a fellow human be-
ing, of a loosening of the usual
hesitancy that. accompanies most
such meetings.

Scene: coffee table, with
small circle of people surround-
ing the violinist. Someone men-
tions Mr. Silverstein’s position
as concertmaster of the Boston
Symphony; there follows an ap-
praisal of that orchestra’s new
; conductor- a candid and en
lightening exchange. Then some-
|.one asks: “What do you think of
; the Sibelius Concerte? I think

he's a vastiy under-rated com
| poser ” The artist stirs, he
turns and for an instant there is
absolute equality they be

| ready to argue
' TIME FLIES
“Really? I think he's vastly
} over-rated ..." And so it be-

But his comment, Davidson, is
one you might sincerely be
proud of. Pity it has value only
inside the Ghetto.
