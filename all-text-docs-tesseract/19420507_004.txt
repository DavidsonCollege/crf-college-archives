Leaving a brilliant record for the season behind it the varsity

track team ended the year Sé

over the highly vaunted squad

be taken that this is the team which recently won the Carolina
A. A. U. meet and was supposedly the best in the state.
Another feather was added to the track team’s collection when

From the freshmen squad will come several likely
prospects who should go far in an attempt to fill the

gaps left by the above graduations.

George Peters

marked himself as sure fire varsity material in the frosh

meet

with Mars Hill Saturday when he scored 23

points. Peters broke the school record for the high
jump, clearing the bar at 6 feet, 3-5 inches, but it won’t

stand as official since he is a freshman.

Peters also

placed first in the broad jump, low hurdles, pole vault,

» and came second in the highs.

The end of round five of the Interfraternity Softball

games, with the Phi Gams in second with only one

defeat.

Davis Thomas has been whipping his fast

ball in there for the first four games and if he keeps
up the pace they should easily come through victori-
ous if the Kappa Sigs or Fijis don’t upset the bucket.
