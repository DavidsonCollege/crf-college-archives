CCRL Sub-Committee Studies Drinking

By DAN VOORHIS

The Committee on Campus and Reli-
ous Life is currently struggling with
problems which the proposed change in
North Carolina’s drinking age laws
would produce if passed this fall. -

A subcommittee formed to study the
matter formally presented its ideas to the
Committee last Wednesday. “It clearly
presents many problems,” said subcom-
mittee chairman Charlie Summers, “but
if the state changes the law we’re stuck.”

The state may raise the drinking age
sometime this fall. Since the nature of the
bill remains undefined, the CCRL can
only make broad policy recommenda-
tions for the new College president to re-
view when setting up the rules.

The College is trapped between
strictly enforcing the law, which some
have suggested would harm student so-
cial life, and ignoring the law, which sets
a bad example and invites police interfer-
ence. “We want to teach respect for the
law, provide guidelines for all social or-
ganizations, but without becoming the
vice squad,” said Summers.

The most difficult issue concerns
drinking on Patterson Court. According
to the subcommittee’s recommendation,
the houses will not be forced to conform
to any policy changes, although all will
probably cooperate with the College’s
suggestions. The CCRL recommended
that the houses rearrange their parties so
that they control the alcohol supply. The
responsibility of breaking the law then
falls on the individual rather than the
house. Dean of Students Will Terry
suggested, ‘“‘No kegs; a single entrance to
check I.D.s; BYOB; and smaller or

closed parties.” It will be the houses’ re-
sponsibility not to police parties but to re-
duce the chances of the law being bro-
ken.

The Code of Responsibility will be
altered to include the new law.

Political Science Classes

By JEFFREY MANN

Two political science classes have
conducted scientific, generalizable sur-
veys of the student body: Dr. Mary
Thornberry’s Political Analysis class in-
terviewed 96 students, and Dr. Tom
Kazee’s Public Opinion class tracked
down 206.

Kazee’s class is studying ‘the forma-
tion, change, and measurement of politi-
cal attitudes.” They completed a poll to
learn first hand the limitations of surveys
and the meaning behind the information
the surveys provide. Each student was
given a list of ten randomly selected stu-
dents to interview. Students developed
the entire poll including selecting topics,
writing questions, interviewing, and
analyzing data using the College’s com-

puter.
Thornberry’s class studies “the
analytical approaches and _ research

methods used by contemporary political
scientists.” They used the smaller survey
to see how social scientists use statistics
to evaluate data.

Both surveys covered overlapping
but not identical general areas. The fol-
lowing are selected percentage results
from the surveys.

problem in other colleges. Dartmouth,
under the same drinking-age limit, des-
cribed the situation as “‘a mess.” The at-
tempts to control drinking have caused
conflict between the students and admin-
istration.

The 900 Room, as a College-owned
establishment serving alcohol, will re-
quire strict enforcement of the drinking
age if the new law is passed. The College
does not want to exclude freshmen from
discos, dances, or other 900 Room enter-
tainment, so it will probably use a close
check at the bar of either color-coded IDs
or hand stamps.

Freshman halls present a problem in
the relationship between freshmen and
their hall counselors. The CCRL does
not want the counselors, representatives
of the College, to alienate their advisees.
The Council proposes passive enforce-
ment of the drinking age. No hall money
will be spent on alcohol; hall functions
such as mixers will focus on other ac-
tivities. The counselors will not deal with
those drinking in their rooms. the
CCRL’s hopes to change the social at-
mosphere of the freshman hall away
from drinking without causing conflicts.

Change in policy will not affect up-
perclass dorms.

Members of the CCRL subcommittee
are: Charlie Summers, Sam Hay, Rob
Spaugh, Doug Ammar, Roxanna Guil-
ford, and Hartley Hall. The remaining
members of the CCRL are: Chairman
Will Terry, professors Laurence Cain,
Ruth Ault, and Peter Krentz, and stu-
dents Emily Davis, Buncie hay, and Be-
verly Hart.
