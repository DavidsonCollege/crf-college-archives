Field Hockey

Davidson loses to
Appalachian State, 3-0

By LARRY DAGENHART,
JR.

The Davidson field hockey
team dropped its fourth game ina
row Tuesday as the Mountaineers
of Appalachian State beat the
frustrated Cats, 3-0. Davidson’s
record is 2-5-1.

“We’re having trouble playing
together as a team, right now,”
said Betsy Pryor. “But that’s also
not unusual for a young team, and
we’re playing with mostly fresh-
menand sophomores,” she added.

The Wildcats were outshot by’
ASU, 28-10, and were awarded
only one penalty corner to the
Mountaineers’ seven.

Alison Chapman also got
eleven goalie saves.

One bright spot for Davidson
was the play of midfielder Marta
Bukowski. “She had good sup-

port play, hustle, and an overall
good game. She was really think-
ing out there,” said Pryor.

This weekend Davidson travels
to Virginia to play Roanoke Col-
lege, a team comparable to most

of the Cats’ regular Deep. South

opponents. Two other weekend
matches will be against Ran-
dolph-Macon Women’s College,
the weaker of the three, and Divi-
sion I Radford.

“Radford will be the hardest,”
said Pryor. “They’re used to
tough competition like UNC and
Old Dominion. We’ll have -to
play our best.”

Who Will Win It All?

By PHIL PRESCOTT

Since this isa lull week for most
college football teams, itis a good
time to look at the national cham-
pionship picture.

The first weeks of the college
football season has separated the
contenders from the pretenders.
Asalways, the easier the schedule
the better the chance at the na-
tional championship.

Football is the only collegiate
sport where the polls determine
who is the #1 team at the end of
the séason. One of the problems
with this system is voter bias:
coaches or sportswriters voting
for the team they like or are more
familiar with.

I can discuss the virtues of play-
offs to determine the national
champion but the system will not
change any time soon because the
bowls make too much money.

A team from a major confer-
ence hasn’t been ranked #1 in
final polls, since Georgia in 1980.
The SEC-Southeastern Confer-
ence wasn’t very strong when
Georgia won. Clemson ‘in 81
from the ACC, Brigham Young in
84 from WAC, & Oklahoma in 85
from Big 8 were the only other
teams from conferences to, be

ranked #1 in this decade.

Penn State, who won the na-
tional championship in 1982 and
86 as well as Miami, who in 83
and 87 were both independents.
Playing in a major conference--
SEC, Pac 10, or Big 10 will nearly
kill your chances at an undefeated
season.

Aubum and Alabama are the
only teams from the SEC with a

chance at the national champion-

ship. Auburn has the toughest
schedule in the SEC; playing LSU
Oct. 8, and Florida Oct. 29, away;
Georgia at home Nov. 12, and
Alabama Nov. 25 at a neutral site.

Auburn should lose their un-
blemished record early against an
angry LSU team, happy to be
home after 2 straight tough road
losses.

Alabama has to play Penn State
and Aubum at a neutral site as
well as LSU at home. Alabama is
vulnerable after losing star run-
ning back, Bobby Humphrey, to
an injury and Penn State will
probably burst their bubble before
the other teams have a chance.

Then we go to the Pac. 10
where UCLA and USC both have
perfect records. UCLA has the
easier road only having to play

sion of the ball to the team he/she
is rooting for.

Often the spectator is only

making a joke of the situation
because he/she has no idea why
the whistle actually blew.

Usually, the official blows the
whistle as the result of a foul--
either obstruction or advancing.

Obstruction. occurs when a
player uses her body to keep her
opponent from getting tot he ball.
Theoretically, both players must
have an equal chance at the ball.

Advancing occurs when the
ball bounces off a player’s body
and is used to the advantage of
that player or a teammate.

Most of the time these fouls
happen naturally, but no matter
what the intentions are, the
whistle will blow and the other
team will get the ball.

Washington State and USC at
home, and Oregon & Arizona
away. .

USC has to play Oregon, Wash-
ington, and Notre Dame at home,

with Arizona State and UCLA

away. USC’s chances at a perfect
record are hampered by their
scheduling, it will be almost im-
possible to beat 2 great teams,
Notre Dame and UCLA i in con-
secutive weeks.

UCLA could come into “the
USC game undefeated but proba-
bly will be upset by Washington
State or Oregon, two blossoming
football teams that no one knows
about.

With those 4 teams falling by
the wayside we are left with the
four independents Notre Dame,
Miami, South Carolina, and West
Virginia.

West Virginia. has the best
chance at a perfect season, play-
ing Boston College, Penn State,
and Syracuse all athome. Barring
a major upset West Virginia
should be undefeated.

South Carolina has 2 big games
against Florida State at home and
Clemson away. Florida State has
the great defense which should be
able to stop South Carolina multi-

CONFERENCE, from page 10

Hussey is no different.

“T think it’s a good league. It’s
a good basketball conference.”

However, Hussey. sees the di-
versity of the league’s academic

_ Standards as well. “I don’t think
you will find total academic simi-
larity.”

Still, according to Hussey, “it
would be our bestalternative right
now.”

If membership in that sates
ence’ does not materialize for
Davidson, /Hussey_ hopes the
administration will look “else.
where. He believes that the Sun

* Belt Conference is a viable alter-

native: “I think the Sun Belt
would be good for us.”

Although Hussey admits the
size differences between Sun Belt
schools and Davidson, he does not
believe the larger-schools have
that much advantage. “It is an ad-
vantage in terms of fan support.”
Buthe also says, “we probably get
a higher percentage of our stu-
dents at the games” than larger

‘schools. .

Finally, Hussey sees the poten-:
tial Davidson class of 1994 as the
critical class. Having only one

senior on his squad this year and
havi y received an early
mitment, his recruiting roster

is set for next year.
However, “next year is the real

critical year. We’ll have six sen-
iors who will be graduating.”
“The new sports complex is ob-
viously going to help” with re-
truiting, Hussey asserts, but he is
not sure if it will make up for the
lack of conference affiliation.
ae at the upcoming cam-
, Hussey likes the schedule.
ate amore competitive schedule
than we’ve had.” But he ex-
presses concern about student and

“ fan support without those confer-

ence rivalries.
' Overall, Hussey wants to “sell
our positives” in both recruiting

Davidson does athletically, he

says, “‘let’s decide our own fate.” ~

Friday, October 7, 1988 THE DAVIDSONIAN

By DAN COTTON
‘The Davidson College
baseball team is looking for-
ward to this spring to try to
improve on its school record
of 28 wins set last year.

The Wildcats have gotten
off to a slow start this fall, but
the team’s performance is not
as important to second-year
coach Jim Stoeckel as is
evaluating players in prepara-
tion for the spring schedule.

“Although we are one and
three at this point, I’m not
concerned about the results in
‘the fall.
spring training, and I’ ve been
very pleased with the overall
work habits and performance
of our players to date.”

Davidson opened Septem-
ber 20 by travelling to UNCC

.and came away with a 7-4
victory. The Wildcats were
led by a 3 for 4, 4 RBI per-
formance from junior Mikio
Aoki and four innings of shut-
out pitching from senior cap-
tain Jeff Loser.

Fall baseball begins

We treat this as’

The next day, UNCC visited
Davidson and returned. the
favor by beating the Wildcats,
10-7 with the help of a 5-run
fifth inning.

In other action, Catawba de-
feated Davidson 5-3, and Len-
ior-Rhyne surprised the Cats
with a two-run ninth inning to
take a 5-4 decision.

Sophomore pitcher David
Williams has been impressive
with six innings of scoreless
work. Also, freshman Mike
Liebdzinski has been flawless
at shortstop while contribut-
ing base hits and hustle for the
offense.

The Wildcats remaining
home games this fall include
the Alumni Game on Satur-
day, Oct.8, at9 AM; Winthrop
on Wednesday, Oct. 12; and
Wake Forest on Friday; Oct.
14.

The fall season concludes
with a Red-Black intrasquad
game on Saturday, Oct. 29
(Parents Weekend) at 2:30
PM. }

dimensional offense. South Caro-
lina still has to play Clemson in
“Death Valley,” the last game of
the season.

Don’t expect Clemson to lose if
South Carolina comes into that
game undefeated, Clemson will
be psyched to burst South Caro-
lina’s bubble, and it doesn’t lose 2
games at home in a season.

That leaves us with’ Notre
Dame & Miami who play each
other Oct. 15. Notre Dame has
Miami and Penn State at home
and Pittsburgh and USC away. If
Tony Rice, Notre Dame’s quar-
terback, can throw the ball with
any proficiency, which I think he
will, Notre Dame will win the
national championship.

Notre Dame has 2 advantages

in the Penn State & Miami game,
the revenge factor losing to both
of them last year & playing them
both athome. Notre Dame should
beat Pittsburgh because they area
better team.

USC is the biggest roadblock,
but USC will have less than a
week to prepare for the Notre
Dame game after playing UCLA.
Notre Dame isn’t going to let that
game get away if there that close
to a perfect season.

If Miami were to upset Notre
Dame they would still have to
play at LSU, no easy task. I see
West Virginia & Notre Dame fin-
ishing the season with perfect
records, playing. in the Fiesta
Bowl with Notre Dame prevail-
ing.
