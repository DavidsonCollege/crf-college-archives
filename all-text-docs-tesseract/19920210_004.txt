Foxx, Smith Tabbed
to Lead Student Body

By Phelps Sprinkle
Last Tuesday the category one
elections were held and seven new
positions were filled. Theaesults
are: Anthony Foxx--SGA Presi-
dent; Alden Smith--SGA Vice-

President; Ann Todd--Union Presi- —

dent; Kristen Stricker--Union Vice-
President (co-curricular); Meg
Jones--Union Vice-President
(social); Deidre Montague and
Tom Price--Student Solicitors;
Arthur Morehead and David Lind-
say--Defense Advisors.

Anthony Foxx was optimistic,
yet apprehensive about his new
role as SGA President. Foxx takes
office at a time when tensions over
several issues are high. “I’m kind
of nervous about it, to tell you the
truth, because no one knows what
to expect,” Foxx told the Charlotte
Observer last Wednesday. “This
could bea very exciting and fulfill-

ing time for the college. But it
could be a frustrating time, too.”

Foxx is the first black SGA
President tobe elected at Davidson.
After a semester marred with ra-
cial and sexual tension, Foxx’s
election is particulary significant.
When asked about the importance
of his election, Foxx said, “I’ve
been black all my life, but being
President is new for me. I believe
that I can provide some unique
insight, particularly on this new
issue of intolerance.”

Foxx also stressed the impor-
tance of unity among various
campus organizations. “I want the
SGA to be grass-roots, where the
students feel that they have some
say about what is going on. The
immediate challenge for me right
now is to find my place between
the students, faculty, and trustees.”
