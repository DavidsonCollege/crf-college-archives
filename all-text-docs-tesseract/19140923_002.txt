THE WAR AND THR COLLEGE.

On the whole, the war has not affect
ed the opening attendance in Southern
Colleges nearly as much as was expected.
A tew schools report losses and a small
er Freshman class doe to tight: financial
conditions, but the majority have began
the year’s work with am enrollnent-of
students equal te, H not larger, chan that
of last vear. The University of North
Carolina is erawded with over nine hun-
dred students. Wake Forest his 450, of
which number 150 are new men, “Tria
ity begins with Ane prospects, David
son, though with a tew less than she had
at the corresponding date Tast year, fas
nothing to be ashamed of jin the line
quality and material of the new class.
The Northern colleges are just opening,
bur general indications are thatethe war
will not lower to any great extent the

enrollment, except) perhaps in some of}.

the technical schools. ‘Vhe American
peaple are tacing the new crisis with
equanimity, and it is good to see the:
work of the universities and colleges
mave forward unhaltingly in’ the tace
of it.

FOOT RALL.

Davidson's foot ball games this “Fall |
are being talked and fought over miny
times before thes will be plaved.  Every-
one has a prophecy, or at least a secret
opinion, as to, the outcome of each one.
The men who watch che scrimmaging
carefully every day from the side lines
are unanimous “ine the conviction dhiat
Davidson will havea very: strong team.
Tre will be strong because every man of
the squad of fifty is being given a
chance, and a strong “reserve is being
built up. But while our hopes rise and
our confidence deenens as the outcome of
the battles this fall, we must never let
the unconquerable fighting | spirit, on
sridiran and side line, die dawn. We
may win every game. and we hope to,
or we may lose all, which we do not ex-
pect to, but win or lose, the new David-
son spirit that will date from tors must
never ebb. Every new cman shauld be-
giv learning all the Davidson cells. and
songs immediately, for he will be ex
nected to do a tremendous part in back
ing the team up to victory.

In another part of this issue will be
found a stirring appeal from a leval
alumnus in regard to the Clemson game.
Evers Davidson man will read it with
pride and determination.

KNOCKERS.

You never saw a very rich man laugh
at a poor man. You never saw an ath-
lete sneer at a cripple. You never saw
a deep and true student scoff at an illit-
erate. And vou never will.

A man seldom demeans thoge below
him in statior wealth, talents. and an-
portunities. “Uhe man who habitually
criticizes and koecks—knacke these who
are. better than he is. and the knocker
knows it. Jealousy is the root of all
knocking, and the man who indulges in
continual fault-finding will search him-
