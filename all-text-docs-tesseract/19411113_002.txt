BOOST OUR BOOSTERS

Men of Davidson should be grateful to
the publicity managers of newspapers,
radios and sports writers all over the
state for keeping Davidson’s banner high
through thick and thin.

Saturday’s football offered little in the
way of interest to big-time news men, yet
Charlotte’s papers and Charlotte’s radio
stations fiilled the press box with type-
writers and radio equipment capable oi
broadcasting the world series.

But the fact that these men were there
in not the main reason we should be grate-
ful to them. Editorial such as the ‘David
and Goliath” comparison in a recent Ob-
server, and other similar-compliments
should not go without some appreciation
from Davidson’s student body.

They’re all on our side. Not just be-
cause they pull for the underdog, but be-
cause they've always seemed to like the
Wildcat spirit, which reveals itself even
in the darkest hours.

When Pat O’Brien noted that David-
son’s cheering continued even after Duke
had shown her indubitable prowess, it
showed that ‘Davidson can still be on top
even on the day of a decisive football de-
feat. Sneer at “moral victories” if you
wish, but there’s something about the
Davidson way of doing things that out-
siders notice immediately.

LET’S PROFIT BY
EXPERIENCE

Nineteen hundred forty-one and forty-
two has gone this far without a single case
up before the student council. The law of
averages or what have you prompts us
that in all the previous years in the history
of Davidson one or more persons *have
been tried for crimes concerning their
honor.

“It happens in every school,” say some
who think Davidson is like other schools.

Yet, why can’t the men of Davidson
this year profit by the experience of those
men who in the past have stepped out of
line ‘with Davidson’s code of ethics? When
persons are found guilty’ by the student
council of crimes such as stealing, cheat-
ing or perjury, they are immediately dis-
missed from school for such offenses
could in some way warn the present mem-

bers against committing similar crimes,-

perhaps their please would be enough to
prevent any further offenses.. . ~.

When a person is caught in dishonesty
at Davidson, the student body is stunned
by the truth itself---then it realizes how
utterly crazy a person must be to make
such a mistake here.

So let’s profit by the experience of for-
mer years, Instead of saying “It happens
in every school every year,” let’s be able to
say, “It happens in every school --- but

Davidson.” |

DOUBLE CUTS?

Much to the chagrin of many Davidson
students, cuts that are taken in classes one
day before and one day after Thanks-
giving Holiday are to be counted as dou-
ble cuts, unless the faculty changes the
rule now in force. The only concession
we have is that Saturday cuts will be single.
This works a hardship on many of the
boys who wish to take that opportunity to
gohome. Since the football game last year
was in Wilmington, this rule was tem-
porarily suspended. Many of the boys
who lived a long way from Davidson used
this to get home. It could: well be used
for such a purpose this year.

For two days before and after Christ-
mas and Spring Recesses, cuts will be
counted double, also, announced Dean
Bailey-early this week. This does not work
such a hardship on a majority of the boys
as do the double cuts before and after
Thanksgiving, because there are only a
few who would profit by an extra day or
two-at that time.

Letters to The Editor

Dear Tony:

For reason, unaccountable to me, the sar-
casm of my letter of last week seems to have been a
trifle too subtle for the average Davidson student,
and I fear for other readers as well. At any rate,
during the past week I have been praised for taking
a stand that [I did not take and rebuked for ‘de-
fending that which I intended to attack. I refer
of course to my statements concerning the ungentle-
manly conduct of the Davidson student body during
the first appearance here of John Kirkpatrick at
chapel. ‘

some

If you recall [ commended the audience for dis-
regarding “outmoded ideas of courtesy and _ polite-
To my mind these ideas are not yet outmoded

-at least not here—So I had assumed that by this
phrase, if no other, the true tenor of my letter would
Such not being the case,
however, may I state now that it was not my inten-
tion to criticize Mr. Kirkpatrick nor was it. my in-
tention to praise the student body, of which I was
very much ashamed. I hope that I have made my-
self clear enough that “even the least’ will have no
further trouble understanding my _ position.

have been understood.

in

When a member of the Senior Class is quizzed
as to his plans following graduation his reply may
mention any occupation from dentist to shoe polish
salesmart, but he will inevitably qualitfy his answer
with the words “If the army doesn’t get me.” Sta-
tistics drawn from sketchy bits of information on
‘the members of the class of '40 go far to prove this
qualification.

Of the thirty-seven members of last year's gradu-
ating class who completed the advanced R. O. T. C.
course twenty-one are known to
have been. called to active duty,
nineteen in branches of the regu-
lar army and two in the Marine
Corps. At the last report John
Hay was én route for the Philli-
pine Islands, where he will start
his military career. Six of this
group were deferred to enter med-
ical school. The remaining ‘ten
were under age upon graduation,
but expect to be called as soon
as they are granted commissions.

we

Military service is not ‘confined to R. O. T. C.
graduates, however. At least three member of the
class have started training in the Marine Reserve
Corps. Two are’én active duty in the United States
Navy while two more start their preparatory work
at Northwestern University. for the Naval Reserve
Corps on January 1. Three- are known to be flying
with the Naval Air Corps and several are connected
with the Army Air Force. A majority of the class
cegistered for the draft, although exact. figures were
not revealed, and‘some have already been selected as
privates.

Not only are these figures true for last year’s class

a number of years back. Records in the R. O. T. C.
department and in the alumni files indicate that
Davidson graduates of the class of 1923 and beyond
are serving in the armed forces of the nation. The
highest in rank being Lt. Col. David Bethea (’23).
At least six majors and an unknown number of cap-
and‘ lieutenants now in uniform took! their
training here’.

tains

Although Davidson would have a record of which
to be proud if a complete roster were published, it
is not unusual among the colleges of America. Many
school would undoubtedly show even larger numbers
in the huge military machine now under construction
inthis country.

The unusual fact is that young men from every
section and every state show such an unprecedented
willingness, even gagerness, to contribute several
years of their lives, or even more, if necessary, to
their country. And, with few’exceptions, they insist
they are having the time of their lives.

So when you tear open that official envelope and
find your orders to “leave immediately, destination
unknown,” or your acceptance in the Air Corps, or
even the dreaded questionnaire, remember that you
will have plenty of company and, incidentally, another
tradition. mS

“Y” Corner

By SHAW SMITH

Columnist's Note:

(Beeause he is in charge of the
Gift Fund this year, and because
he is a writer, Monroe Bush plays
with the words of this column.—
Shaw Smith.)

Peter Marshall—big and brawny
-that boyish, self-conscious grin—
man of the world, and man of the
other-world=tough as nails, and
soft as Love itself—preaching like
a swamp fire—bulling with us—at
the football game—at the tennis
matches—“Duty is for man, Destiny
is for God!'—true Scotsman and
loyal American—a great Christian—
a swell guy!

Recently two upperclassmen were
in conference with an “infallible
power” in the Administration. He
asked if they thought Davidson stu-
dents were far enough removed
from adolescence to be trained in
the adult art of giving. Now it’s
rumored that they said in reply that
we under-grads are not only old
enough to be trained; but have,
already, in a meaurse come to realize
the responsibilities that go with
money. And they went on to point
out that next week, when the Gift
Fund Drive is held, the students

/themselves will prove their state-

ment.

It’s an old institution around here,
this Gift Project at Christmas time,

as old as Enoch, or Elm Row, or’

some of thé®jokes our professors
tell. It's the one opportunity during
the college year for the students,
as a unit, to prove themselves by
not just giving, but sacrificing. This

season the “Y” Cabinet has decided

Mi

to save you the bother and ennui
of a long campaign, by concentrat-
ing their efforts (which are your
efforts as well) into two short days
—next Tuesday and Wednesday.

The Project, which is the best
yet, will bé announced Tuesday
thornitig; that'll give you about
forty-eight hours to check on your
check-book, figure how much you'll
get at Christmas, meet with the
collector on your hall, and sign
of those little white pledge
cards with a pledge of $5 or $10
(Yep, freshman, a Davidson gentle-
man really strains to give what he
knows he should).

This year the “Y” Cabinet has al-
ready pledged almost $200—fifteen
fellows gave $200! But the Project
is as much yours as it’s the Cab-
inet’s; the Project is OUR Project.
We believe that every Davidson
man will pledge something. We
believe that those pledges will
be real. money, real sacrifices—not
just chicken feed such as kids in
the grades might give.

And here’s a P. S. If you've got
a rich relative, or a brother who
has been to Davidson, or if you
know a man who has just won the
Irish Sweepstakes—get an extra
pledge card and drop it in ‘the
mail to him, “Everybody has got
to help; and with everybody help-
ing we'll prove to that “infallible
power” that a Davidson student
can, and WILL, produce the goods
when he’s called on.*

ITEMS IN THE LOCAL NEWS
Concerning the “Y’ Gift Fund:
One of Davidson’s greatest tra-
ditions which is wholly a student
tradition is that of subscribing
to the annual Y. M. C. A, Christmas
Gift Project. In the past, a social
in
Davidson has been built and named

center .for our colored friends

after a student, a missionary has
been sent to Brazil, a village for
Lepers in Korea has been built and
named after Davidson College.
These are only a few of the many
worthwhile projects that the Gift
Fund has payed for in recent years.

Soon the Gift Fund. will be an-
nounced and student workers will be
around to get your pledges. The
project this year is one of unsually
fine proportions, and it is certain
that the Student Body will support
it as well as they have inthe past.
Some of us will have to sacrifice a
show or two, that new shirt and
tie we've had our eyes on,but we
may be sure that it is for a worthy
cause, and that we will feel much
better for having given our propor-
tionate contribution, —
