OMICRON DELTA KAPPA

INITIATES THREE
DAVIDSON GRADUATES

On the night of January 22, 1921,
Coaches H. M. Grey and Fred Henge-
veld, together with Dr. Tolly Thompson,
were duly initiated into the Delta Circle
.of the Omicron Delta Kappa Honorary
Fraternity.

Coach Grey, '17, who has won a warm,
spot in the heart of every Davidson sup-
porter, is one of the best known foot-
ball coaches in the South. Coach Henge-
veld, ‘17, our admired basketball and
baseball coach, is also a strong sap-
porter of everything for the betterment
of athletics on our campus. Dr. “Tolly”
Thompson, ‘os, and now a professor at
Union Seminary, was delivering a series
of talks on “Your Life Work” here to
the students at the time of the initiation.

These men have been of great service
to their college and on this account they
made themselves very worthy of receiv-
ing the honor that the O. D. K. is able
to confer upon men who have done so
much to further the interests of the col-
lege in every way.

Knights of Neptune Make Merry at
Infrequent Convention

‘During the greater part of last week ‘y

all events, local and sectional, hinged
around the magnificent Infrequent Con-
vention of the International Knights of
Neptune, which it was our exquisite
pleasure and superb honor to have hold-
en in our humble hamlet.

The wheels of industry skidded, and
labor, love, and law, marked time; while
among our sometime desolate hovels
and rambling ruins, Queen Festivity sat
enthroned, and swayed her hilarious
scepter over those who came to worship
amid the scenes of revelry and discord,
where fun ran rife. ;

Chiefest among those things which it
was permitted to us to see, and by far
the most laughable of all the laughable
events in the wonderful week of gay-
ety, were the initations of the Priests of
Mystic -Whiteness.

It may be said for the benefit of the
uninformed that initiations to this de-
gree can be held only on the occasion
of a specific, mystic, white signal from
the heavens. And it so happened that
at this very convention the signal ap-
peared. Now this degree is very high
among all the high and honorable de-
grees in Neptune, and greatly to be de-
sired. For it is even higher—yea, much
higher—than the very high degree of
Frigid Shower.

So, when the signal appeared from the
heavens, the Priests lost no time in
rounding up their victims. The writ of
habeus corpus was straightway suspend-
ed, for the time being, and in its stead
were issued writs of quo vadis and sub
nivem.

In high places and low places, along
highways and hedges, in the market-
place and on the commons the Priests
carried on—yes, carried on something
scandalous. Hundreds and thousands
were persecuted with the rites of Mys-
terious Whiteness. And nowhere, when
the sun was low, could you find any
bloodless, untrodden snow!

Other and countless degrees of Nep-
tune were conferred. Among the most
high and worthy were: Soda, Dish,
Florida, Fire, Joy, Pluto, and Frigid
Shower.

Highest of all honors conferred were
those upon Pitts Douglas and Doc La-
Far, who received the Mississippi (Fath-
er of Waters) at the hands of Jap Cum-
ming and Chink Witkinson, Pacific
Knights from the Eastern Realm.

Bill Roberts, Star Le’
Forward of 1921 V

Has Proven Himself One
Players of the Carolinas

William Worth Roberts, better known
to his many admirers as “Bill,” is a for-
ward and the star point getter on the
Wildcat basketball quintet. Wilmington,
N. C., claims this lad as a native son and
Bill says he is proud of it.

Bill entered Davidson during “the
good ole days” of the S. A. T. C. He
played class and company ball that fall
and looked ripe for the Varsity. But rhe
call of the shipyards was too strong and
he did not return in the spring of ‘19.

But with the re-opening of college in
the fall, Bill returngd to his alma mater.
He was the mainstay of the Soph team,
the undefeated champions of that year.
As chief basket tosser on the Varsity ne
won a warm spot in the heart of every
true supporter of the Red and Black.
He hung up the enviable record of scor-
ing more than half the voints of his
entire team.

After the holidavs this year the rc-
port came out that Bill would not re-
turn to college. At chis rumor the bot-
tom fell out of the Wildcat stock. Fut
it soared high when he blew in a week
late, but all the more welcome.

So far this spring the Wilmington lad
has more than upheld his reputation.
In the three games played on the Hill
he has collected 59 points. Against N. C.
States he rang up 26 points, exactly
doubling his opponent's scose. Great
things are looked for from him on the
Virginia trip. If Bill is going good, three
more games will be hung up on the right
side of the Wildcat ledger.

Lieut. M. H. Ellis Begins
Work at Davidson

Comes Here from Service on Mexican
Border, Accompanied by
His Family

Lieut. M. H. Ellis, of the Cavalry, has
recently been detailed as one of the
military instructors at Davidson. Lieu-
tenant Ellis comes to this R. O. T. C.
unit direct from the Mexican border,
where he has served ever since receiv-
ing his permanent commission.

A charming wife and two promising
youngsters make up his family. Both his
children are boys, one being two years
old and the other four months. The
Ellis family will reside in the Houston
house until the Helper cottage can be
put in shape for them.

Lieutenant Ellis comes originally from
‘the North, Pennsylvania being his home
state. He graduated from Allegheny
College, at which his wife was then one
of the co-eds.

At Leavenworth the Lieutenant re-
ceived his commission and has since
seen border service in Company “L” of
the Twelfth Cavalry. As a token of
their appreciation, his men presented a
gold watch to him just before his de-
parture to take up the work here.

Already the new Licutenant and his
family are spoken of in the highest
terms by all who have met them, and
undoubtedly the Davidson men will do
all in their power to make Lieutenant

|Ellis’ work here as pleasant as possi-
e.

DAVIDSON PUBLICATIONS

TO BE REPRESENTED IN
N. C. PRESS ASSOCIATION

A mecting of all the editors of the col-
lege papers and magazines in the state
has been called for February 5th, in
Chapel! Hill. The purpose of the mect-
ing is to form a college press associa-
tion for North Carolina. The Davidson-
ian is to be represented by J. E. Cassell
and J. M. Gaston, and the Magazine by
D. L. Mahood. All three men will leave
Davidson Friday and be gone for the
week-end. Cassel informed the reporter
that he does not intend to make an ad-
dress at this meeting.

If the organization can be perfected it
is hoped that all the college publica-
tions of the state can be of mutual benc-
fit to each other, both in an editorial and
managerial way. Later on in the spring
there will probably be a business meet-
ing at which time some actual plans can
be formulated. ‘

Guilford and N. C. State Swamped

Scoring With a Regularity of Clockwork Wildcats Pile Up Total of 96.

’

Guilford Game.

In Davidson's first intercollegiate basketball game of the 1921 sea-
son everyone recognized the fact that once again the college is repre-
sented by a first-class quint. The Guilford team having played N. C.
State the night before, had plenty of fight left and from start to finish
put all they had into the game. After beating State they tried hard to
keep up their good record, while Davidson was anxious to start her rec-

ord on the credit side of the ledger.

QUIPS AND CRANKS
READY FOR PRESS

The 1921 Annual is complete, with the
exception of a few late picture, and
some art work, and will be in the hands
of the printers within ten days, the
Quips and Cranks’ management reports.
The volume will contain practically 324
pages. The editors. are working hard to
get the copy to the press as soon as is
possible, and urge that all who can do
any cartoon drawing or have any hu-
morous articles, see Carl Long, at 2
Rumple, right away. The Beauty Sec-
tion is still somewhat depleted, and it is
urged that all who have pictures turn
them in immediately.

Rev. John W. Moore Ad-
dresses Y. M. C. A.
on Obedience

Suggests Method by Which Students
May be Helped to Live
Christian Lives

What our Church needs today, accord-
ing to Rev. Jno. W. Moore, is something
comparable to a “modern crusade,” com-
posed of men and women who will fol-
low Christ’s commands implicitly.

The speaker told of an incident in the
recent war in which American soldiers
did not follow their orders exactly and
were caught in their own barrage. They
pushed on, in spite of losses, and took
their objective, but they caused the
French commanding general to remark,
“The Americans fight like lions, but they
are not quite soldiers.” They lacked the
necessary implicit obedience.

We ought to obey Christ not thru
fear of consequences of disobedience,
but because of a certain filial love, as
of children to a father. Two of Christ’s
greatest commands, in the speaker’s
Opinion, were those requiring us to ac-
cept the authority of God’s Word and
Christ, and to give a tenth of our income
to God's work.

Mr. Moore suggested that some of the
students band themselves together in a
society of “Christ's Crusaders,” with
these two commands as their creed. He
stated that he believed that the tithe
was more important than many other
parts of our worship. We should be
careful, however, to make our gifts
where they are most needed, and not
where they will come back to us again.

——We Want 18 Class Reunions in 1821-—

Dr. Martin left last Monday for New
Orleans*°and Texas on a business trip.

Promptly at 8:30 Referee Christenbury
started things going, and thanks to his
efforts, it was a snappy game thruout. At
the first tip-off Guilford got the ball,
but after several unsuccessful attempts
at a basket the Wildcats took it up the
floor and Romefelt made the score 2-0.
From then on it was as pretty a display’
of team work on the Wildcats’ part and
as stubborn a resistance by the Guilford
team as has been seen in the gym in
some time. The Red and Black having
started right, tossed baskets from every
part of the court, till at the end of the
first half the score stood 21-8, David-
son’s way.

During the time between halves the
band made a happy and noisy time hap-
pier and noisier by giving some of ‘their
best music. The second half started
strong but gradually the Guilford team
became worn down and the Wildcats’
scoring machine ran wild. During the
latter part of the half Coach Hengeveld
ran in all substitutes and these carried
on the work of the first team in a first-
class manner. The final score was 51-14
and the Wildcats rested with the as-
surance that their best was done and
appreciated.

To pick an outstanding star of the
game would be impossibl.c Bit! Roberts
was as usual the leader in individual
scoring with 17 points. John Schenck
and Romefelt cach had. 12 and the rest
of the squad made up the remaining 12.
Every man on the Varsity came up to
every expectation and the subs were full
of fight.

A summary of the game follows: .

Davidson. Position. Guilford.
Schenck, J. R. (12) ---.2-22. Lindley (2)
