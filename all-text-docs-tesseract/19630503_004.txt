Philosophy Conference held at
Emory University Saturday.
April 27.

The conference. held jointly
with Davidson. Emory, Sewanee.

is an attempt to encourage in-
terest in philosophy and_ to
stimulate critical thinking on
the part of students. The faculty
js exchuded from discussion.

Each year 2 topic of import-
ance from the field of philoso-
phy is chosen for discussion.
Each of the four schools pre-
sents a formal paper on the
topic and two students from the
other schools criticize it. The
floor is then opened for infor-
mal discussion. Each paper is
allowed about an hour and a
half. '

The participants were Patrick’
Freeny, D. C. Gilley, Joe Me-
Outchen, David Suter. Peter
Schade, Dale Joyner, George
Williams, Chuck Weaver, Jay
Federman. and Bill Ferris.

The topic of the conference,
the A Priori, was chosen from |
the area of epistemology, or
knowledge. It is concerned |
with that type of knowledge

which is prior to and inde-

pendent of experience; hence,

A Priori.

The Davidson paper, The
Necessity of the A Priori in A.
J. Ayer’s Language, Truth and
Logic, was written by Freeny, a
junior. Gilley and Suter respond-
ad to the Sewanee and Emory,
papers, respectively. '

Davidson will serve as host
to the. Conference in May. 1964. |
The topic selected for next year |
is Martin Heidegger, a German,

Muence on the philosophy of|

“Sweden's railroads and buses
are administered nationally:
they seldom make a profit,” said
Bergstrand. “Utilities are en-
tirely nationalized. but this
limits no one’s freedom.

“Public schools are also ad-
ministered nationally; there
are no focal school boards.
All students take the same
exam at the same time. There
is a medical program in which
people can get back two-
thirds of what they paid for
medical care.” ,

After Bergstrand ended his
talk by saying that Sweden has
the lowest mortality rate in
Europe, Christian Faber-Rod be-
gan by saying, “Denmark has
the highest suicide rate in the
world. Well, you have to be
proud of something!”

Suicides are most common.
he said,-amorig old people and
among girls between the ages
of 18 and 30. He said that so
cialism may be. the cause of
suicides among old people—they
don't want. to have to be cared
for by a welfare agency. Faber-
Rod stated that- many of the
women who commit suicide
after having illegitimate chil-
dren do it not because of shame,
but because cf sadness when
their ‘lovers’ don’t love them.

He-said that blind dates aren't
nearly so common in Denmark
as they are here. A boy may
pick up a girl at a restaurant-
dance hall and take her: home.
There is no restraint due to
“morality.” he said.

He added that one-night af-
fairs aren‘t too common be-
cause most girls must feel
that love is involved.

He said that in many Euro-
pean universities boy and girl
students live on different floors
in the same dormitory, and that

responsibility of the father for
an illegitimate child was a law.

Asked about sex crimes, Fab-
er-Rod was unable to make a
positive statement, but he said
that they were probably less
prevalent in Denmark than in
America.

The audience of 19 included
Miss Elizabeth Johnston, Peace
Corps representative, and Alex-
ander Wustmann, foreign stud-
ent from Germany. Wustmann
was asked about sex in Ger-
many.

He said that German schools
too had classes about sex “be-
cause the government realizes
that parents fail to give a
good explanation to their sons
and daughters.”

He said that a major factor in
Germany was the shortage of

in Denniark only under very

five million more women than
men in Germany. Wustmann
said that German women often
put advertisements in the news-
paper which state their capital
assets and that they are looking
for a husband.

All of the speakers favored
the European attitude toward
sex. Faber-Rod said, “I think
the -attitude toward sex is
healthier in Denmark than in
America. You can walk through
Belk Dormitory and. see ‘play-
mates’ on the walls in many
rooms. I'd rather have mine in
‘living color’.”

Bob Parker, President of the
IRC, announced next year's of-
ficers at the IRC’s last meeting
of this year, held on Tuesday
night. Named -President was
Grier Stephenson; the Vice-
President will be Jim Brindell;

For Racial Harmony

BY CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Assistant Editor

The telltale sound that warns a driver that one of his tires is losing air or a chapel speaker that he is displeasing
his audience did not. mar the visit of James Farmer to

“Instead, his audiences greeted
the organizer of freedom. rides
and sit-ins, the national director
of the Congress cf Racial Equal-
sty (CORE), whieh is an anath-
ema in much of the white south,
with respect—and with serious
cuestions that penetrated to the
cepths of white misgivings about
she complete abolition of all
color lines that Farmer preaches
and works for.

_ "Skin color is a biological ac-
cident,” the heavy-set Negro told
ais listeners. He said that the
prejudice that makes color an
all‘important quality and then
ascribes other qualities accord-
ing to color is not inborn. “Chil-
dren have to be taught it. Well,
what is learned can be unlearn-
€d and that is the purpose of
CORE."

From this point, the barrage
of student questions homed on
the implications of the “creative
contact" that Farmer wants be-
tween the races and the “posi-
tive, aggrezsive steps” that his
srganization seeks to gain it by.

By “creative contact” he did
sot mean interracial procrea-
tion. Asked if complete integra-
tion would mean intermarriage,
he reminded students of one
salient fact: “No more Negroes
can marry whites than whites
martry Negroes.”

He further stated that in.
termixing of the illegal var-
iety has been going on at a
rapid rate since the slaves
first arrived, to such an ex-
tent that some sociologists
claim that 80-90 per cent of
-all Negroes have white blood.
Finally, he reassured his Jis-
teners, “Negroes opose inter-
marriage as much as whites.”

The problem of the desirable
extent of racial separation pro-

voked a question on how Farmer
felt ebout the Black Muslims
from a student who had ob-

viously read his Playboy, which
interviewed Muslim spokesman.

Malcolm X in its May issue.

Farmer based CORE opposi-
tion to the Muslims on their
position of racism—black su-
premacy and total race separa-
tion, “We don't believe in a
racist theory of history.” com-
mented Farmer.

He estimated Muslin member-
ship at around 10,000, far below
the Muslims own estimates, and
then explained why he thinks
the Muslims won't sweep the
country. “Negroes spring from
a non-hating Judaeo-Christian
tradition. They're Methodists
and Baptists. Now if they (the
Muslims) become the Black
Nazarenes, then we're in for
trouble,” he concluded to the
laughter of his audience.

He explained CORE separa-
tion from National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of

Colored People (NAACP) in
terms of methods to achieve
the same desired goal of
racial equality, with the con-
comitant employment and
eduationa! opportunity.

“Any action we take follows
in three steps. First we investi-
gate the situation to see if it
needs action. Then we try to
negotiate to get what we want.
Only if we don't get a signifi-
cant concession do we take di-
rect action.” He noted that the
NAACP approach when negotia-
tion produces unsatisfactory re-
sults is to go to the courts.
“Litigation takes so long,” he
contended. “And even when suc-
cessful it often only decides
moot. issues.”

Farmer pointed to numerous

the Davidson campus Monday.

instances of direct action CORE
has taken to close what he call-
ed the gap between the law and
its implementation. He said that
now, after the freedom rides, a
Negro can eat at an unsegregat-
ed bus station lunch counter in
Anniston, Alabama, where a bus
was burned during the rides.

He told how CORE rented
trucks to carry trash from a
Negro slum in New York and
dumped the collected refuse
on the steps of City Hall to
convince the city to give the
Negro housing area as fre-
quent sanitation service as
surrounding white areas were
getting.

The questions continued, with
Farmer fielding each one deftly,
often hurling back a far more
complete answer than the ques-
tioner had sought. A WSOC-TV
cameraman stepped into the
circle of students around Farm-
er and put a mike cord around
his neck. “Lf we were in Missis-
sippi I don’t think I'd let him
do that,” quipped Farmer.

While the cameraman took his
pictures, more students wander-
ed in to the discussion, bringing
attendance to nearly a hundred
curious, intent students.

He characterized Adam Clay-
ton Powell: “Intelligent, a lot of
ability, a complete opportunist,
a dangerous demagogue. He has
Failed to use his great talent
effectively for the benefit of

movement.” |

Farmer unflinchingly gave his
personal opinions on James
Meredith, although he was ob-
viously hesitant to: speak about
the man who ended segregation
at Old Miss. After emphasizing

was under, he said. “Meredith
has done many things he should-
n't have done. I have disagreed
with his utterances and his writ-
ings. But I feel he has stood up
quite well under the circum-
stances,”

His questioners, impressed
with his candor, had many more
questions, even after four hours
of discussion, but Farmer had
to leave to be interviewed in
Charlotte on WBT-TV. The
students rose as he bustled out
to his ride, thinking about his
final comment released to the
atmosphere of a church-related
college.

“He who preaches love in a

Following in their wake, Pow-
ell and his fellow corpsmen
will try to build the local
Panchayat into a democratic
unit. The main obstruction, he
said, would be the remnants
of the caste system.

Auman's plans are necessarily
vague, pending action on his re-
quest to teach. He stated, after
& talk with Miss Johnston, that
he had confidence his request
would be honored.

pected to complete the work
normally due under the con-
tract.”

Goodykoontz sald that he stat-
ed in the first condition that
his salary should be paid until
the end of the year because “the
end of the contract year is the
last of July. I was afraid that
they would not pay me after the
end of the semester if I'did not
add thal condition.”

Goodykooniz said that ‘he nad
not decided where he would go
after he left Davidson. But he
did say. “Johnston's haste to
expedite my departure will not
work, as I intend to stay around
for the meeting of the Board of
Trustees.”

Goodykoontz emphasized that
he was still interested in his
cause for more creativity and
freedom at Davidson. He added,
“I will give a part of the money
they will pay me for next year
to a fund marked specifically to
establish a creative writing
magazine at Davidson. I urge all
alumni and students who can
afford to do so to contribute to
this fund.”

In a signed statement handed
to THE DAVIDSONIAN yester-
day, Dean Johnston made the
following comments:

"IT have, as you know, accept-
ed the resignation of Dr. Goody-
koontz as of May 1, 1963.

As President Of Union

BY JOHN HIGGINS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Staff Warren, the new president of the College Union, publically assumed the

office on Friday, April 26.

About 150 students and facul-
ty members were present as
Warren took the gavel at a ban-
quet given by the College Union
in honor of the students and
faculty who have worked on the
Union projects this year, either
in committees or in special pro-
grams.

Warren outlined the major

points of the program he hopes/|’

to institute at the Union. He
plans to add to the present
Union services or functions as
well as expanding the existing
ones. He listed two remaining
projects which will take place
this year.

On. Tuesday, May 7, a panel,
partially comprised of some of
the exchange students, will eval-
uate this year's experience at
Davidson. The panel will be
composed of Christian Faber-
Rod from Denmark, Geoffrey
Luckock and John Lewis of Eng-
land and Frank Pfeffer, a native
of Uruguay.

The Union will conduct a
spring auction on the day be-
fore ROTC exam. Teachers
and students will be asked to
contribute anything they no
longer want; or they may
bring items they would like
the auctioneer to sell for
them.

Warren also mentioned some

activities which the Union will!

undertake next year:

1. Dr. G. L. Abernethy will
fead a discussion on the ques-
tion, “Are You Getting Your
Money’s Worth at Davidson?”

2. A Last Lecture Series will

INFERIORITY CAN BE FUN

The second gravest problem confronting college students to-
day is inferiority feelings. (The first gravest problem is of
course, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority house
canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority
feelings and their ible cures.

Psychologists divide inferiority feelings into three principal
categories:

1. Physical inferiority,

2. Mental inferiority.

3. Financial inferiority.
__ {A few say there is also a fourth category: ichthyological
inferiority—a feeling that other people have prettier fish—
but I believe this is common only along the coasts and in the
Great Lakes area.) the feel

t us start wi feeling of physical inferiorit; rhapa

the easiest to understand. Naturally We are inclined to feel
inferior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful home-
coming queen. But we should not. Look at all the people,
neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their marks in
the world. Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates. Look at
Caesar. Look at Lassie.

Ri a.

What I mean is that you can’t always tell what’s inside a
package by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course, you
can, Take Marlboro Cigarettes, for example. Just one glance
at that jolly red-and-white package—so bright and pert — so
neat but not gaudy—so perfectly in place whether you are at
a formal dinner or a beach picnic—so invariably correct for
any time, clime, or condition—one look, I say, at this paragon
of packs and you know it has to contain cigarettes of absolute
perfection. And you are right! That pure white Marlboro
filter, that fine, flavorful blend of Marlboro tobaccos, will
ve you a smoke to make the welkin ring, whatever that is.
those of you who have just been sitting and admiring your
Marlboro packs since the beginning of the semester, why don’t
you open a pack and light one? Light a cigarette, I mean~—
not the package. Then you can settle back and smoke your

Marlboro and, at the same time, continue to gaze rapturously
at the pack. Thus you will be twice as happy as you are if

that is possible.)
But I digress. Let us turn now to the second category —
mental inferiority. A lot of people think they-are dumber than
other people. This is not so. It must be remembered that there
are different kinds of intelligence. Take, for instance, the clas-
sic case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and Sturbridge, stu-
dente at Wake Forest. It was always assumed that Claude was
the more intelligent just because he knew more than Stur-
bridge about the arte, the scienoes, the social sciences, the hu-
manities, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten
times smarter than Claude when it came to tying prann knots.
But no matter; everybody looked down on “Stupi Sturbrid ”
as they called him and looked up at “Clever Claude,” as they
called him. But who do you think turned out to be the smart
one when their granny almost got loose and ran away? You
guessed it—good old Stupid Sturbridge.

We arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority.
One way to deal with this condition is to increase your income.
You can, for example, become a fence. Or you can pose for a
life class, if your college is well heated..

But a better way to handle financial inferiority is to accept
it philosophically, Look on the bright side of pcverty. True
others may have more money than you have, But look at ail
the things you have that they don’t—debts, for instance, and
hunger cramps.

And what about friendship? You don’t need money to have
friends, and let me tell you something, good people: the older
you get the more you will realize that nothing is so precious as
friendship, and the richest man in the world is the one with
the most money. © 1003 Mos Shulman
