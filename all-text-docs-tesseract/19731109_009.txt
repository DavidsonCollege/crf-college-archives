Wildcats Meet Citadel
In Gridiron Finale

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

Sporting one of its worst
records in recent years, the
Davidson football team will
travel to Charleston, S.C. for
its final game of the season
with The Citadel one week
from tomorrow.

With their overall record
locked at 1-8 and their record
in the Southern Conference a
dismal 0-6, the Cats will be out

to salvage seventh place in the
conference ratings.

If the Cats lose, it will be
only the second time in 11
years that they have won only
a single game and the second
time in 13 years that they have
lost to every team in the con-
ference. The 1971 team had a
1-9 overall record and an 0-7
SC mark.

A win would push the Cats
into either a tie for last place

Sidelines With
GORDON

Davidson College has desubsidized its football
program. This move for all practical purposes ends
any myth that assumes the Cats can play major
college football.

Two personal interjections.

First: the move is very discouraging to me
because I do not think that we should have given up
the ship despite the extra money that was direly
needed to put the program back in shape. My
priorities, however, do not agree with those of most
people concerned with the situation.

Second: I do not really believe that Davidson
College could not come up with the money for foot-
ball. I think we could have gotten it from
somewhere. But, I am not one of the gifted finan-
cial wizards that preside over the fortunes of this
institution.

But I do not feel that this is the time to rock the
boat as far as football is concerned. The decision
has been made and I am ready to see Davidson
move even farther in this direction as far as foot-
ball is concerned. There is nothing that will be
gained by dissent.

Instead, I want to make a suggestion to help im-
prove the quality of football here at Davidson
within the new guidelines our trustees have
brought forth.

It is quite apparent that we are no longer able to
compete with the likes of anyone in the Southern
Conference, save maybe The Citadel and VMI. The
other schools are just pouring too much money into
their respective programs.

So I suggest that we regroup our forces and start
getting a schedule that is almost totally outside the
conference and includes schools which have
similar programs. Now it is quite apparent that it is
going to take several yeurs to get to this point. But
the longer we wait, the harder it will be to get into
some grouping with these comparable schools.

The problem, as I see it, rests with the prevailing
idea that we can still compete within the realm of
the Southern Conference for five games and thus be
eligible to win the conference championship. This
is simply an absurd position to hold, in that we can-
not compete on the same evel with five conference

oF ope that the leaders of this school will continue
their venture into realism so that we can win,
because it is reasonably certain that we cannot do
this with five conference games.

We are still at a critical point with regard to foot-
ball. We need to move farther, before it is too late.

with the Bulldogs, providing
the Bulldogs beat Furman
tomorrow, or give them the
next-to-last place finish in the
conference with a one game
lead over The Citadel.

Head coach Dave Fagg will
be looking to find a solution to
the defensive problems that
have taken place in the recent
games

Against VMI, the defensive
unit was too vulnerable to the
rushing attack of the Keydets,
of course, the Cats were con-
siderably outmanned in that
game, as VMI had a very fine
and fairly large sized of-
fensive line to open some holes
for their speedy William John-
son, a freshman halfback who
played in his first varsity

game and carried the ball 26 Sim

times for 168 yards.

Offensively the Davidson
squad had trouble finding the
correct method of attack
during the first half. After
being held to a mere 48 yards
passing in that segment of
the game, quarterback Dave
Harper found the range on 14
passes in the second half for
217 yards.

Harper was able to generate
enough offense to put all 17
points on the board during that
half. Both Wildcat touchdowns
were scored in the final
period.

The Cats will have to once
again rely on their potent
passing attack when they face
the Bulldogs.

The receiving corps, led by
senior Walt Walker, will have
to be in top performance in or-
der to win on the Bulldogs’
home grounds.

Defensively the Cats will
have to be on the lookout for
a versatile Bulldog offense
which almost upset Clemson
in the season opener.

The Citadel is coming to the
end of a very disappointing
season. At the start of this
campaign, they had high
hopes of finishing near the top
of the Southern Conference.
They will not even be able to
obtain a winning record at this
point.

The game boils down to
which team wants to winbadly

Davidson, on the one hand,
has just lost its football sub-
sidy. People: think that the
Cats will be able to compete
with four teams in the con-
ference. But last week's loss to
