Ed. Note In a recent interview,
former WDAV Station Manager Sid
Barrett outlined the development and
history of WDAV.
Additional research using original
documents confirmed the statements.

WDAV staff, Spencer states that
Wdav “‘is a legitimate student activ-

importance of it, especially to those
involved in its operation.”’

February 25, 1977 The Trustees
approve the expansion to high Power.
Minutes of the meeting, not released
to WDAV staff, state,‘‘There was
discussion regarding an expansion of
the range of radio station WDAV in
order to cover Mecklenburg County
and to fill a need for a station playing
primarily classical music. It was
moved and seconded that the current
plan for such a high power radio
station, including a capital outlay of
up to 71,000 dollars, be endorsed,

provided the College Administration
is assured of maintaining overall
control of the station at all times.
After discussion regarding...the ad-
visability that’ a more-specific state-
ment of purpose be drafted and
presented to the Board...This motion
was unanimously adopted.”’

Staff members fear loss of control

By CAROL LOPTSON
Asst. Focus Editor
The WDAV managing staff is dis-
turbed by 1 recent events in the 50
percent classical controversy and is
afraid of losing the station as students
have come to ‘know it.

The main problem, as General Ma-

: nager of WDAV Carrington Thompson
sees it is that the staff does not want to .

play 50 percent of any type of
programming, including jazz, rock,
folk, educational, or classical. Thomp-
son said, ‘The staff wants quality, not
quantity.”
~--Thompson also sees several “‘corol-
lary problems.”’ “‘One, where does the
programming authority lie? Two, who
revoked the constitution and why?
Three, if there was any mention of 50
percent classical before April, it has yet
to be found. There was no mention of it
that I know of.”’

He continued, ‘‘Four, what’s the
student's place going to be at WDAV?

rid of students at WDAV? Six, where
does the Board of Directors fit in?
Seven, who has the right to close a Post
Office box when it’s paid for by student
funds? Eight, are we programming the
station as a public-service for our
audience or as’a fund raising proposi-
tion?’’

WFAE, the UNCC 10-watt station,
has won the $122,034 federal grant it
needs to buy equipment to boost its
power to 100,000 watts. The article
said WFAE General Manager Bo’
Pittman said the FCC should

the power boost any day and the power
boost should be accomplished by June.
UNCC has not raised all of the required
$40,670 in matching local funds.
WFAE hopes to obtain National Public
Radio (NPR) affiliation as soon as it is
well-staffed and at full power. As an
NPR affiliate, Thompson expects
WFAE to program primarily classical
music along with some educational and
news shows.

Also, in July, South Carolina’s
state-owned 100,000 watt WPRV (88.9
FM), an NPR affiliate, started broad-:
casting from close by Rock Hill.

When asked about the effects of
WFAE becoming a high power station,
Thompson responded, ‘‘I hope they do.
I really just do not see us competing
with them. Commercial radio is where
the competition should be. We're
here to complement each other.”

“What's the use forus to program 50
percent classical music when they’re
going to be doing that.”

“If we were to have such a narrow
range of programming, I think it could
be detrimental to the College's image,”
said Thompson.’

‘Heelaborated, “rg they’ re billing
this college as an institution of higher

education.committed to the highest

values, it.seems contradictory to
remove educational opportunities and

do it through what “we consider ;

Thompson said, ‘‘I 1-think we've done
more to keep communication open‘

“The communication we're working
on right now is with the Trustees.”

The WDAV staff intends to try to
talk. with the Trustees at the upcoming
meeting September,21.

“We want to approach the Trustees
with a program format that is going to
satisfy the image they want to projec
as well as serving the community wi
a diversity of excellent programming
said Thompson.:

Thompson said the actual format to
be presented has not been drawn up,
but he indicated there would probably
be no radical changes from the present
WDAV schedule.

As-for improvements and future

plans, Thompson said ‘The main thing

is we want to build up our jazz
programming. We're looking at
building a really good ‘news staff;
adding network news as soon as we get
authorization for it; broadcasting live
coucerts from the 900 Room; and
increasing locally produced educational

‘programming.’

According to Thompson, ‘‘We've
established a tremendous jazz audi-
ence.” -
Staff members said the audience

response to jazz programs has been

encouraging. Wilson stated, ‘“‘We have
had more requests to expand our jazz
programming at least 2 to 1 over
anything else.

Starting this next. Monday WDAV
will be adding two more hours of jazz
programming a day: for a total of four
hours a day.

The staff is enthusiastic and proud of
the station’s progress since it went
high power.

“We're doing a damn good job now,”
emphasized Thompson.

“Every person on the managing staff
and the people who’ve worked with us
before I think have really been working
their best to make the station go,”
stated Thompson.

Mary Francis Leopold, Educational
Programmer, concluded, ‘All we ask is
a chance to serve our audience and not
just the Trustees. The Trustees are 55
people. Our audience is potentially two
million people.”
