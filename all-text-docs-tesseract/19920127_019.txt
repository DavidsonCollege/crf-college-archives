"ON THE |
SPORTS
FRONT

By Bruce Balestier

When, with nine seconds left
in Davidson’s game Saturday
night with Winthrop and the
Wildcats trailing by three points,
Janko Narathitaclosely-guarded
jump shot from just under 20
feetaway, itseemed ascript-like
conclusion to a gutty and tena-
cious comeback. In addition, it
seemed perfect redemption for
the 40 minutes of generally poor
basketball the Wildcats had per-
petrated on the crowd in atten-
dance. Swept up in the emotion
of the moment, the five players
onthe court for Davidson worked
to prevent a desperation game-
winning shot by the Eagles, and
were no doubt ready to get on
with the business of winning the
game in overtime.

Unfortunately, no. one_no-
ticed until just two seconds
remained that the referee had
signaled for a two-point basket,
and that Narat’s clutch shot had
brought Davidson only to within
one point. By the time Detlef
Musch was able to foul
Winthrop’s Carlo Wilkins, the
Wildcats’ chance for victory had
fallen by the wayside. Narat’s
heave from beyond halfcourt at
the buzzer bounded harmlessly.
off the backboard. ;

Thus spoiled was an other-
wise perfect comeback. The
‘Cats had used clutch shooting
and defense, along with missed
Winthrop free throws, to bounce
back from the seven-point defi-
cit they faced with just over two
minutes to play. It seemed pos-
sible that they might escape with
awin despite playing two halves

of very uninspired basketball.

After the game, Davidson
center Detlef Musch lay-on a
table in the Training Room with
an ice-pack strapped to his calf.
Somehow, in the waning mo-
ments of the game, a Kick to
Musch’s shin had burst a blood
vessel, causing a hematoma in
his calf which had swelled to the
size of a baseball. Through the:
often intense pain, Musch said;
“I can’t believe we lost by one
point.”

Indeed, there was cause for
alarm in the loss, Having lost al-|
ready to three of the top four
teams in the Big South standings
(Charleston Southern, Coastal
Carolina and Liberty), a. win
against fifth-place Winthrop was
imperative. The narrow loss
(Davidson's fourth by two or
less points to the Eagles in the
last three years) raised familiar
questions - about, the. team, It

better team than they are show-
ing themselves to be. A team
thatplays competitively with top-
20 teams Alabama and UNCC
should not lose to Winthrop.

seems clear that the ‘Cats are a}.

NCAA Compliance Director
Ingram Sheds Light On

Student Athlete Participation

There has been a great deal of debate surrounding the amountof time
required to participate in intercollegiate sports. Last year the NCAA
passed legislation which declared that a maximum of 20 hours per week
could be “required” of student-athletes who are “in-season,” and that 8
hours was the limit on individuals or teams participating in coach-
directed activity outside their traditional playing seasons.

What does the situation at Davidson College look like? The table
below shows the average participation time per week for Davidson’s
varsity teams. (During December, for the most part, there was no
practice.) The numbers reflect average hours per week taken from
athletically-related sctivity forms filled out by coaches and/or student-
athletes and verified by members of the teams.
