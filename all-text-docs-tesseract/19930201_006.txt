From The First

At an enthusiastic meeting on Wedvesday night, March
18, the Davidson College Student Body voted for the establish-
ment of a weekly newspaper. Later, an editor and business
manager were elected and a staff appointed. The present issue is
the firstfruits of this action. The Davidsonian makes its initial
bow.

In the inauguration of such a newspaper, many questions
no doubt arise. “Why a college weekly? Does it have a real
value? What will it stand for?”

The newspaper-is largely what its name imphies, com-
posed of news. It should be in close touch with every phase of
College life and the life of the community about it. Even in a
small college, life becomes more and more complex; and as the
students are broken up into an increasing number of groups, there
is a tendency not to look beyond the questions and matters in
which one man is directly interested. The college newspaper
should give live.information about every group and department
of college activity, keep them acquainted with each other, and
thus promote a feeling of mutual interest and encouragement. In
addition, there are the things which vitally concern every stu-
dent, and yet which are not well known or misunderstood.

But the boundaries of a college are not the limits of its
campus. Inclose contact with it every day is acommunity which
is certain to influence and be influenced by the student. The town
column should make every man feel that he has friends in the
town, and their interest in the college should be increased by the
weekly items and topics about it. :

The old Davidson spirit which has held sway at Davidson
in tradition and fact for years goes with the graduate that leaves
here...

The newspaper...can increase the spirit in athletic, literary,
social, and religious life here; it can be a link between college and
community, alumni and alma mater. The Davidsonian asks for
your earnest cooperation.

OF THEIR CHOICE...

Letters

Smith Appreciates Sculpture

To the Editor,

It is a genuine pleasure
to see that the Senior Class
of 1993 has decided to
presenta gift of public sculp-
ture to the Davidson cam-
pus. This timely gift fills a
great need and begins to es-
tablish a long-needed tradi-
tion of creating a kind of
ballast in our visual environ-
ment which, excepting the
Chambermaids and Jacob’s
Ladder in Vail Commons,
has remained strangely be-
reft of sculpture. The even-

tual installation of public
sculpture will be a welcome
addition to the. liberal arts.
Not having sculpture in an
intellectual and academic en-
vironmentsuch as Davidson
is akin to not having books
in the library.

Itis a double pleasure to

see thatthis project wasorigi- .

nated, encouraged, and sup-
ported by students who have
recognized their visual needs
within the context of atradi-
tion of benign iconoclasm.
This gift and-the important

processes which surround its
acceptance are signs of
Davidson’s coming of age. I
am grateful to those students
such as Chris Hoveland
whose enthusiasm and ef-
forts have revitalized us and

_ brought us to see ourselves

and our campus in a fuller,
more intellectual, and more
thoughtful way. :

Sincerely,

Shaw Smith

Associate Professor of
Arts and Humanities

OPINIONS

Itis important to respect
everyone’s background and
heritage. People are truly
lostif they neglect their roots
and the wisdom of their pro-
genitors.

The wonderful mosaic
thatis Americais comprised
of representitives of every
race, gender, creed, and way
of life. Homogeneity is defi-

ever, this positive urge for
inclusiveness is being per-
verted under the banner of
diversity.

People have been se-
lected for cabinet positions
in the new Clinton adminis-
tration because they suppos-
edly represent different
blocks of voters.

Wouldn’t you find it in-
sulting to be picked for an
important post not on merit,
but because the administra-
tion needs to pacify special
interest groups and follow
through on campaign prom-
ises.

I find it insulting, also,
because, as an American, I
deserve the best possible
cabinet. Why should Bill
Clinton only interview
women for a post that repre-
sents all the people? Why is

kind. It is downright crimi-
nal for someone to be judged
as qualified or unqualified
for a job that represent all
the people because of race
or gender.

What about diversity at

_ Davidson? The Black Stu-

dent Coalition does their best
to celebrate the heritage and
achievements of blacks cur-
rently and: throughout his-
tory.

In the curriculum, re-
quirements have been
changed to make sure that
students learn about other
cultures before the gradu-
ate. That is fine as long as

the required study of ourown
collective American (West-
em) culture and History is
not ignored.

There are complaints
thatminorities are treated un-
fairly at Davidson. I am not
qualified to answer: to that
criticism, but it seems to me
that people shouldcome here
to be part of our community
of individuals, not to be a
Statistic or a token.

Why be a Davidson
black student when you can
just be a Davidson student?
If minority enrollment is de-
clining it does not mean that
there is anything inherently
wrong with the school. If
rules have been broken in
order to treat minorities un-
fairly that is a big problem.
There is nothing atall wrong
with the present system at
Davidson with regards to
minorities as I see it.

What happened to Dr.
Ballard’s door is inexcus-
able, yet that was done by an
individual, not by the sys-
tem. The ultimate goal of
any community is to have its
members treated as individu-
als. Endless meetings and
