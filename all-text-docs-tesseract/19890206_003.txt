Facing death for nature’s sake

Graduate returns to share wilderness adventures

By JAN-JOOST BOUWMAN

Environmental activist Charles
Tambiah has faced death more
than once in his worldwide pur-
suit of wildlife studies. Elephants
have charged at him and nearly
trampled him several times. Once
he was almost bitten by Sri
‘Lanka’s most poisonous snake,
whose venom can cause death in
less than eight minutes. On an-
other occasion he nearly lost his
right hand to a python. And if
those dolphins had not come
along that shark might have come
too close...

Despite frightening experi-
ences like these, Tambiah still
can’t contain his love for nature.
Even with his share of what he
calls “challenging” situations, he
doesn’t think the wilderness is
dangerous or offensive. Tambiah
said the animals gave him warn-
ings that he was intruding in their
personal space. When he disre-
garded the warnings, they at-
tacked.

Tambiah graduated. from
Davidson’s Center for Special
Studies last year with a major in
international wildlife conserva-
tion. During high school in his
native country, Sri Lanka, he
became more attracted to nature
than to his books.

After graduation from
Davidson last year he received a
unique offer from the Smith-
sonian Institution to spend 18
months alone in the Sri Lankan
jungle, studying wildlife in its
many forms. He said he learned
an enormous amount about and
from wildlife in the freedom of
the atmosphere there.

“Freedom is very important to
me, freedom in nature, the free-
dom of being yourself. It’s a way
to relate to other living creatures,
both animal and human. Animals
share your freedom, they respect

“your personal space and accept

you as you are,” Tambiah said.

\ Tambiah caught an Indian rock
python one day and took it to his
camp, where he marked it and
released it. Three years later he
encountered the same snake.
“There was no aggression at all,
but a mystical sense of recogni-
tion. I picked it up, carried it
around, it sat on my bike, on my
shoulder and it slept with me in
my sleeping bag at night-and it
was a completely wild snake.”

From the» python Tambiah

learned about the bonds that are
possible between people and
wildlife, and about the ability for

animals to remember and respect -

people-especially those humans

who work to help them. in their
struggle for existence.

A leopard visited Tambiah’s
camp for several weeks in the

_ jungle. He never got to see more

than the cat’s tracks,..which he
mapped to monitor its “territorial
behavior.” One warm night Tam-
biah decided to sleep outside. The
next morning he noticed the leop-
ard’s paw marks all around his
sleeping bag.

That morning he followed the
fresh tracks until they disap-
peared. Walking back to the
camp, he suddenly realized that
leopard paw prints were in his
own footsteps! The leopard had
been tracking its human pursuer,
yet it showed no aggression. It
respected Tambiah’s “personal

“Incidents like this taught mea
lot about the reward you can get
by understanding animals. Ani-

mals are generally considered -

lower than human beings. I don’t
think like that, I respect them as
individuals and my success in
field research, in getting so close
to animals and doing such crazy
photography is because | have
learned to respect and understand
the behavior of the being thatI am
working with: I don’t treat ani-
mals as objects.”

Sharing his experiences with
others is very important to Tam-
biah. “It is no use for me to go to
all those exotic places if I can’t
share it. It is of no value if 1am the
only person gaining from it. I did
gain from it-I graduated with
honors in it, but that isnot enough.

With photography asa tool I hope

I can convey my feelings.”

Tambiah seeks to show people
places and animals they would
probably never see otherwise. He
realizes that wildlife conservation
is nota business to make one rich,
but he is devoted to it because it’s
what he wants to do and enjoys
doing. He believes that animals
have the same right to a place in
this world as people and he is
willing to fight for the survival of
ecosystems.

His concern for animals derives
from his hypothesis that animals
are indicators of human exis-
tence. “If we destroy wildlife we
are destroying ourselves,” Tam-
biah said. He describes life on
earth as a big ecosystem that will
break down in sequence, eventu-
ally reaching man at the top of the
pyramid. Taking a single link
from the chain is dangerous.

“By protecting wildlife we are
protecting ourselves; by getting
involved we can create a better

future for mankind.”

Tambiah hopes to attend gradu-
ate school next year, pursuing a
degree in wildlife planning. He
feels that wildlife planners should
be aware of the social, economic
and political ramifications of
their work, as well as the biologi-
cal implications. “There must ul-
timately be“Someone who can
solve the problem and unite con-
flicting interests.”

Tambiah sincerely wishes
Davidson students would become
more involved in wildlife and
environmental issues. “My motto
has always been ‘think globally,
act locally.’ This is very apt for
Davidson.” He said that if stu-
dents became involved they could
Start a sequence that would reach
thousands of people.

“Davidson can serve as an ex-
ample to other schools. And there
are plenty of ways to get involved.
There is the Biology Society; the
Recycling Committee can cer-
tainly use your help. In April there
is going to be an on-campus envi-
ronmental conference, with im-
portant speakers .and lots of ac-
tivities, to stimulate awareness
among students and other com-
munity members. People can
write articles or get internships in
wildlife conservation, too.”

Media innovators launch dramatic series about college grads

making. She and Hancock will apprentice

while in California, Dilettuso brings plenty

The latest fad on college campuses, says
senior Melissa Dilettuso, is student-run
cable TV stations that feature programs
from college news to soap operas based
on3campus events.

Dilettuso, who studied television and
film at the University of California at Los
Angeles last year, is currently writing the
pilot of a show she hopes will set the ball
rolling for Davidson’s own cable station.

Her dramatic series “Between Ex-
tremes”’ will premiere on campus in. April.
The story features four women and two
men who have recently graduated from
Davidson and share an.apartment in Char-
lotte.

“We wanted to do something that people
could look at and say ‘Yeah, I’ve had those

through that after graduating from
Davidson,” said Dilettuso.

Dilettuso developed the idea for “Be-
tween Extremes” from shows produced at
schools such as UCLA and UNC-Chapel
Hill. She said her 30 to 40-minute pilot will
be similar to the nighttime drama thirty-
something.

Theater veteran and senior Margaret
Hancock is directing the show. The two
chose to call the show “Between Ex-
tremes” because the characters are be-

tween the Davidson experience and “being ©

out in the real world.”

Dilettuso admits that she has taken on an
enormous time commitment. Attuned to
the real world herself, Dilettuso said she is
devoted to the project because she hopes to
build a career from television and film-

assistants who might continue the series

‘next year. The ultimate goal is to develop a

Davidson College TV station on which a
news show, this series and other programs
would regularly air.

Having written for a soap opera and
developed a screen play for a feature film

of writing experience to the set. Hancock
has directed several Davidson productions
and worked last term as an intern for a TV
station. The entire film crew and cast will
be Davidson students. Filming will be on
campus, with outside shots made in Char-
lotte.

Abbott examines modern
drama in The Vital Lie

By SONYA STARNES

Are illusions good or bad? What makes
an illusion good or bad? What happens to
people when they are stripped of their illu-
sions? Is God the ultimate illusion. or the
ultimate reality?

English professor Tony Abbott explores
how playwrights have dealt with these
questions in his new book entitled The Vital

/

_. Lie. The title originates from Ibsen’s The

English pr Sctemer and eclerd drama guru Anthony = a 1986-87 Quips &

Wild Duck, the first play Abbott examines
in his book. Ibsen writes, “Deprive the
average man of his vital lie and you’ve
robbed him of happiness as well.”

The preface of Abbott's book relates that’
through his studies of modern drama with
various scholars and teaching a course on
the subject at Davidson, he has “become
increasingly convinced that the reality-il-
lusion theme was the dominant theme in.
modern drama.” Abbott embarked on
“what has proved to be a long and complex
journey” of tracing this theme through the

_ last hundred years or so of modern drama.

Abbott begins the book with an appeal-
ing personal tone by sharing his own grap-
pling with the illusion-reality issue. He
tells the story of his father’s stroke and
subsequent illness, an experience that led
him to Ernest Becker’s The Denial of

Death, which he said provided a frame for
The Vital Lie.

One of Abbott’s aims in writing the book
was “to write something that was critically
competent but also personal, a book written
by ahuman being for other human beings to

He desired to “ask some questions in a
tongue that any intelligent playgoer or
reader of modern drama could under-
stand.”

In exploring this intriguing theme of
modem drama, Abbott hopes to answer-
three questions. First, why should the real-
ity-illusion theme be'so preeminent at this
time. Second, has the way that playwrights
have treated this theme changed signifi-
cantly during the last hundred years. Third,
is the vision of reality presented by Albee,
Pinter, and Genet fundamentally different

_ from that of Ibsen, Strindberg, and Shaw.

Abbott wanted to explore “the relation-
ship between art and life, between the di-

~ lemmas faced by the heroes of a number of

modem plays and the problems of real
human beings.”

The Vital Lie is available in the student
store for something over $25. Wow!
