Construction on schedule

~~ By MARVIN OVERBY
Staff Writer
The new Dining Commons
and Peter Knox and Mary Irwin
Belk dormitories will open in

September 1981, according to

Physical Plant Director Grover
Meetze.
The College is also consider-

‘ing plans for a new athletic

complex and an arts building.

Construction of the Commons
is now on schedule after earlier
delays, Meetze said, while the
two new dorms behind Patter-
son Court are proceeding ahead
of schedule.

The $3:6 million Commons
will seat 600 people. .
. The building will be twenty-
five or thirty feet further south
than originally planned. This
will save the College twenty-
five to thirty thousand dollars,
Meetze estimates, by allowing

- - Bailey and Richards houses to

remain as one food service unit
until after construction is com-
plete.

The two houses will then be .

| Minister of Students Rush Otey leaves for LSU

By TIM WHALEN
Staff Writer

Minister to Students Rush
Otey left Davidson at the end of
August to become campus min-
ister at Louisiana State Univer- .
sity (LSU).

Dean of Students Will Terry
said the search for Otey’s
replacement should begin with-
in a week or two.

Otey, who was also Assistant
Minister at Davidson College
Presbyterian Church (DCPC),
said he took the new job
because he felt ‘‘ready for
something more pluralistic’
after seven years at Davidson.

“In some ways he produced
the best religious programming
here since I was a student,
including my years as chap-
lain,’’ Terry said. ‘‘He made us
uncomfortable in ways that we
needed to be.made uncomfort-
able, and we’ll miss that.”

Otey said he misses his
involvement in student pro-

grams like the Y Service Corps.
He hopes students continue to
take an active interest in issues
of general concern such as the
military draft and world hunger
as well as in more immediate
concerns, especially student
government. ‘‘Davidson tends
to be an autocratic institution,
and students need to work to
retain the voice they do have,”
Otey said.

Clarification

A front page story in the
May 9 issue of The Davidsonian
might have given the impres-
sion that the Admissions De-
partment is seeking a more
homogenous student body com-
posed as much as possible of
southern students. Admissions
Director John Griffith said this

‘ week, however, that his depart-

ment seeks to develop a very
heterogeneous student body
and is beginning programs de-
signed to recruit more students
from other sreas of the country.

DeSenieno prepares for
new computer system

By WALTER LEE

Staff Writer
Robert DeSieno became
Davidson's first Director of
Computer Services this ‘month.
_ DeSieno, formerly a chem-
istry professor at Westminster
College in New Wilmington,
Pennsylvania, has an extensive
background in computer
This fall DeSieno will coor-
dinate’ plans for a new College
computer center. Davidson will

overhaul its present computer |

facility and purchase a new
system.

DeSieno said he is now ass- :

' essing Davidson's future com-
: puter needs. No. details about
the new system have been set.
A new system will eliminate
many of the problems of regis-
tration by employing a more

direct method of processing
information, DeSieno said. The

‘computer now in use relies on

punch cards and much human

handling and communication.
Students will also have great-

er access to the new system,

according to DeSieno, since _

there will be more terminals
available.

DeSieno said he hopes: ‘to
dispel: the computer's: reputa-

tion as a “technological devil”

in liberal arts environments.
“The knowledge of. comput-

ers,"” DeSieno wrote in a College

newsletter, ‘‘should be an essen-
tial part of a liberal arts
education.” As computers. be-
come more and more a part of

. everyone's life, knowing some-

thing about their operation
must become a basic life skill.”

Before the search for a new
minister can begin, the College
and DCPC must finish discus-
sion of the exact duties of the
new minister. They have al-
ready decided that the new
minister will have fewer respo -
sibilities at DCPC so he can
work more with students, Terry
said.

Terry promised that students
would have an important role in

selecting the new minister.

Otey said that at LSU he
works with a very diverse group
including graduate students,
foreign students, and minority
students. His new job also
allows him to concentrate exclu-
sively on counseling and work-
ing on projects concerned with
issues like criminal justice and
world hunger.

moved to opposite ends of
Patterson Court.

The dorms will cost about
$1.2 million. Housing Director
Bill Bolding said no one has
decided who will occupy the
dorms, but they will probably

not house freshmen.

Meetze said the construction
plan for the Commons is to
finish as much of the outside
work as possible before the
weather turns cold. The con-
crete shell and the kitchen are
already in place.

Initial planning for a new
sports complex has also begun,
Meetze said. The complex, de-
signed primarily for intramural
use, will probably include faci-
lities for swimming, basketball,
tennis, and track, as well as a
gym with capacity comparable
to that of Johnston Gym. No
date or price has been set for
construction,

The complex will probably be
located behind Johnston Gym-
nasium.
