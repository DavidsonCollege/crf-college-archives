Vets Receive Checks Totaling
Almost Three Million Dollars

The first of 16 million checks for
the $2,800,000 National Service Life
Insurance special dividend went in-
to the mails January 16.

According to Veterans Adtninis-
tration, the major part of the pay-
ment operation will be completed
by June 30, 1950. Veterans who have
received acknowledgment cards af-
ter mailing in their dividend appli-
cation forms can be assured they
will receive their dividend checks
before June 30. They are warned
not to write to VA if they do not
receive their checks at an early
date, since reading and answering
inquiries will only slow up the pro-
cess at VA.

The mailing of checks is being
done by the Disbursing Office of
the U. S. Treasury. The goal is to
mail 200,000 checks daily for each
five-day work week, or about 1-
000,000 checks a week.

Veterans Administration to date
has received approximately 12,250,-
000 applications for the dividend, of
which practically all have been
acknowledged. However, says VA,
about 25,000 of their acknowledge-
ments have been returned by the
post office because these veterans
had moved from the ‘addresses they
gave in their applications, without
leaving a forwarding address’ with
the post office.

Approximately 400,000 World
War I] veterans have died since
they took out their GI insurance.
The dividend payments of these de-
ceased veterans will be handled
separately. .

Dividends are to be paid on all
National Service Life Insurance
Certificates that were held in force
three months or longer, and the
payments are based only on the
period for which premiums were
paid. The period covered by the
dividends begins with the month in
which each policy was issued and
extends to the anniversary date of
the policy in 1948.

ON SOCIALISM...
(Continued From Page Two)

We might also conclude, how-
ever, that the fault lies with ad-
ministration, rather than the sys-
tem. In short, it is the people jwho
are at fault and not the system it-
self. 1f administration becomes cor-
rupt, we could ask why? An answer
might. be indicated by the fact that,
in present-day culture, the highest
aspiration would seem to. be
power. It can be effectively demon-
strated that power leads to corrup-
tion if held too long. What then
does ‘this indicate? It indicates that
what is needed is not-a new sys-
tem for this country but improve-
ment upon our present system
under which the values of the peo-
ple would be different. Perhaps if
the values of our own culture were
changed, capitalist could more ef-
fectively serve the needs of our
people.

In closing, 1 would fike to say
one thing. Ih. spite of successes
which socialism undeniably has had,
a warning must be issued agairist
authoritarian socialism, i.e. social-
ism in which the people are pam-.
pered and helped completely by
outside agencies. In this country,
as in others, there has been an in-
creasing tendency to give, the peo-
ple what they want or lack, rather
than helping the people to help
themselves. This must inevitably
produce a dependence which, how-
ever equal. the, distribution of
wealth achieved under such a sys-
tem, cannot in the long run, be for
the ultimate good of the people.

PROFESSOR OSTWALT . .

When he ‘was discharged, Prof.
Ostwalt held the rank of lieuten-
ant-colonel.
- Prof. Ostwalt said that his work
at Davidson so far this year has
been about the same as last year.
He .is doing some work with Dean
Bailey in vocational guidance.

We welcome Prof. Ostwalt back
to the campus, and we hope that
his work here will be enjoyable.

pression. The most serious objec-
tion .to Keynes’ program, how-

ever, is that it is not politi&tiry }

fedsible to adhere to it. Popular sup-
port can be secure for increasing
public .expenditures on the basis of
borrowed money,: but~ once
process has started it is politically
next to impossible to -reverse it
when the time arrives to stop
spending and reduce the debt. Had
the federal government been faith-
fully following Keynes’ ideas it
would have a;large surplus in the
current year. The plan becomes a
one-way ‘road to progressive infla-
tion.

No one can deny the exhilirating
effect of injecting more money into
an economic system. Likewise, no
one who has. even a speaking ac-
quaintance with history can be
blind to the fact that continued
inflation leads to economic collapse.
Inflation is a short-range device
with long-range effects. Indeed,
Keynes’ economics is admittedly
the economics of the short-run. His
oft-quoted quip that in the long
run we are all dead may reflect
the spirit of his economics, but it
is a flippant statement that is un-
worthy of a serious student of hu-
man society. In the long run our
children will not all be dead. and
it.is to be hoped that the common-
wealth which we have built for
them will not be dead either.

The pure inflationists who would
run a deficit year after year for
the express purpose of inflating
prices progressively are not a large
group in America, but they may
be dangerous out of proportion to
their numbers. Some of them are
not at all viscious and simply suf-
fer from lack of the distinctly hu-
man capacity to think beyond next
Tuesday. Others honestly believe
that for the first time in history
the light concerning money has
broken on them and that they have
discovered how people can have
anything that they desire simply

this]

ly use monetary inflation as a means
of destroying economic classes that
they hate or an economic system
that. they despise. Having destroyed
that economic system, they hope to
be able to show that it collapsed
from its own inherent weakness.
And so it-may_ collapse, but the
weakness that leads to its down-
fall will not be an economic one,
but 2 moral one. It will be the
weakness of a people that has re-
pudiated industry and responsibility
and turned its back on virtue as
the basis of national life.

Parks Gives Account ee Centinued From Page Two)

Of Missionary Work

John Parks, recently a‘ mission:
ary to Brazil, came to Davidson
Sunday, February 12, to speak to
the Westminster Fellowship on the
recommendation of the Foreign
Missions Committee of the Presby-
terian Church, U.S. Mr. Parks used
as-his subject: “Personal Accounts
of Mission -Work “In Brazil.” He
gave an account of some of the
difficult tasks that a new mission-
ary encounters and showed some of
the needs and problems of fulfill-
ing the work in particular fields.
This is one of the series of pro-
grams being presented for the first
five weeks of the new semester by
the Westminsier Fellowship.

The Reverend Mr. Parks is a na-
tive of Johnson City, Tennessee.
He received his undergraduate edu-
cation from Princeton University,
after which he was graduated from
Faith Seminary in New Jersey. For
two years he was a missionary to
Brazil, and now. expects to begin 1
pastorate in Somerset, Kentucky.

Here the Roman society ceased to
exist, because it was unable to
follow the development of a dif-
ferent social status of the individual
and was overrun by the very primi-
tive but young Germanic society.
Although it, is debatable whether
the resulting society was able to
take in consideration.all the changes
that the social status of the in-
dividual and its society were under-
going, it still cannot be denied that
major changes took place. To dis-
cuss how far these changes were
carried is tot the task of this
theme.

Third and last in the row we
have what [ may call an evolu-
tionary development. It is ques-
tionable whether this form ot
change may be ealled a collision.
It is not in the sense of the word
because it is not a sudden but a
slow process, extending over a
gometimes very long time. We find
this form of development all
through history and always fol-
lowing one of the other two forms.

velopment next week.

From Chapel Hill comes word |
that Federal Judge J. J. Hayes has

At the completion of this new
