Do religion and politics mix?
Reynolds Lecturer Garry Wills thinks they do

By TAYLOR SMITH

Do Americans expect their
politicians to be sinless? This
year’s Reynolds Lecturer, Garry
Willis, gavea positive answer to
that statement when he spoke
last Wednesday night in the 900
Room.

Willsis a nationally noted au-
thor and professor of American
culture and public policy at
Northwestern University.

A regular contributor to Time
magazine, Wills is also the au-
thor of Jefferson’s Declaration of

’ Independence, Politics and Catho-

lic Freedom and most recently,
Reagan's America.

Speaking to a large and di-
verse crowd, Wills spoke on the

- relationship between religion

and. politics in America, and
Dri meee

due mainly to the American

““public’s search for “devils”

against which it can direct its
venom. These devils, at home
and abroad, are individuals
such as Willie Horton, Fidel

Castro, Russia, communism,
Khadaffi and Jim Bakker.

Sin, as a criteria to measure
character, has taken a large
role in the American mind,
said Wills.. The American
people, according to him,
expect public figures, espe-
cially religious figures, to be
perfect.

“The point of religion is the
sinfulness of everyone, even

preachers,” said Wills. “Any- :

way, what is Hester Prynne
doing at a modern political
convention?” .

Wills also talked about the
composition of political insti-
tutions. “Politics will become
more inclusive than exclusive
in the future,” he stated. “For-
merly only white, Protestant
males who have been married

once were: eligible to run.

__Now Catholics and women,
are accepted,-and in time,
Jews should be.”
“Religious tolerance in
politics is expanding”, added
Wills, “but religion is still a
necessary component. Mid-
way into the presidential elec-

tion, Mike Dukakis was
forced to remember that he
was Greek Orthodox in order
to compete with George
Bush.”

This last presidential cam-
paign was unique in that the
American people began to
care about things that were
really of minor significance,
stated Wills. Voters neglected
the serious issues, responding
to base appeals, he added.

The publiccame down with
what Wills coined “flags on
the brain” and “became
frightened of the alphabet”
upon hearing about such top-
ics as the ACLU (American
Civil Liberties Union). The
politics of this election be-
came “the politics of charm,”
he concluded.

‘Perhaps the mostimportant
concept presented by Wills
was the following: “Should
people have the tools of de-
mocracy when what they
want is so clearly deplorable?
After the people elected Bush, —
some commentators wanted
to elect a new people.” ;

stated. “It was very difficult to work —
