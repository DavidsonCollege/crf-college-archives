The Davidsonian

IMAC Report

- By BAD BERNARD
AND HOGMAN

In this the beginning of our
third season, we hope to start
a new tradition that will last
as long as hair remains on Will
Terry's head: the Bad Ber-
nard-Hogman Sportsman of
the Year Award. In keeping
with the move toward greater
rights for the lesser sex, we
have shunned such superstars
asPele and the incomparable
Steve Cauthen in order to
present this deserving award
to the gorgeous Chery] Tiegs.

Her 1977 performance gave
us all many a thrill and lift
when we were down. In her
recent SI pictorial, she dis-
played the barest essentials
for what we can only classify
as raw talent.

¥or recognition Chery] wilt
receive a night on the town
with the leisurely attired Ro-
nald Scott, beginning with a
top-of-the-line dinner (up to
$1.50 and one entree) at the
James Bailey House.

She will then be whisked to
the Morrison Room of the
Union for an Indian bagpipe
concert by O. Howie Phartz
and, before she has a chance to
catch her breath, it’s on to the
900 Room where Chery! will be
dazzled by a quaint sing-along
with the Nichols.

Her evening will culminate
with a raunch and roll dance in
Belk quad--music provided by
Silk Spun. Congrats Chery]

Bernie and Hogman would
also like to begin our new
year by rectifying the grievous
error committed by both ma-
jor college football polls over
the break. We certainly have
no intention of criticizing the
Pope-loving jerks that call
themselves AP Sportswriters,
sO we now quietly present the
corrected Top Ten Football
teams in America:

. Texas
. Oklahoma
. Kentucky
. Fla. State

they were from the North:

Put that in your bagpipe and
smoke it, Dan.

Over the Holidays, Lloyd
Free had the pleasure of
spending a few days with us.
‘All World” departed quickly
for sum’ business at Guilford
but left us with his valuable
and objective opinion of the
IMAC B-League:

“After a full year of writing
a lot about nothing, Bad
Bernard and Hogman have
given up and handed me the
great honor (?) of writing
about the Davidson B-League.
I have made a brief study of
each team; and here are my
findings:

Cagers show improvement

By PERZ
Staff Writer

The women’s basketball team
lost a pair of tough games
during the past week, but not
before a good deal of im-
provement was exhibited.

Last. Thursday, the Wild-
cattes lost to the Camels of
Campbell College, 67-60, in a
game which saw thé officials
call 17 fouls against Davidson.

Chief victims of the officials’
wrath were Sarah Womack
and Cindy Morrison, who
fouled out with 16 and 11
points respectively. High sco-
rer was co-captain Beth Tan-
ner with 20 points.

The offense displayed con-
sistently good passing and
ball handling. They were able
to run their patterned offense
well and as a result, four
players scored in double fig-
ures.

The biggest setback the
women received was when
Womack was lost early in the
second half. As top scorer
against ‘Campbell last year
with 30, she was naturally
keyed upon by her opponents.

Last Monday night, the
women dropped a tough game
to an undefeated squad from
Lenoir-Rhyne, 72-58.

The main drawback suffered
by the Lady Wildcattes was a
severe height disadvantage.

worked the ball in their center,
who at 6'1'', dominated the
boards and scored 29 points,
despite tough defensive play
by Morrison.

Lenior-Rhyne was forced to
work the ball into the middle
because of the good outside
defense headed by co-captians
Tanner and Sally Bondurant.

Tanner, coming off an ankle
injury sustained in the Camp-
bell game, played on the
second half and held Lenior’s
high-scoring point guard to
one bucket.

After only trailing by five at
the half, the girls were down
by no more than 10-points for
the remainder of the game.

They stayed with Lenoir-
Rhyne and remained within
striking distance, only to be
thwarted by the clock.

As in the Campbell game,
the women played well and it
was perhaps their best game
all year.

The scoring was again ba-
lanced, owing to the quick
movement on offense. Womack
was the leading scorer with 18,
Morrison had 11, Donna Fer-
ren managed 10, and. Tanner
chipped in 9.

Next week the women play
two games in the Coliseum.
On Monday, they face UNCC
at 5:30 and two days later they
go against Pembroke at 5:30.

Regs

The Big Daddy Conoscos
Family--A member of the
NCAA (No Class At All) that
seems to have returned to the
B-League just: to beat up on
poor undertalented teams a-
gain. With the 6’9"’ Benning-
hoff in the post and the
immortal library rat John
Zambos, they seem to be
loaded again. They lost Desig-
nated Fighter Dave Herring-
ton (who was least seen on the
other end of Gary Joe Stokes’
fist) from last year’s champi-
onship team and they may
hurt them in the final rounds.

The Red F. Cush Hounds--
Still undefeated in their divi-
sion despite the play of Mike
Barnhill. Mike’s nickname is
“give and go’’--Give me the
ball and go to hell. For the
fourth year in a row he is
leading the league in shots
taken and shots missed.

Slauoul--A darkhorse team
imported from the East. Line-
up includes such stars as
Sahibb, Ishmauuul, Moha-
meed Weetie, Mustaua, Ka-
reem, Mamood and the great
Slauoul. Unfortunataley they
have had defensive problems
because they bow to the east
after every basket. They are

for two points.

SARAH WOMACK leaps high over the Lenoir-Rhyne defenders

=

true winners

coached by the one known as
Kissmatool.

Ragmen--Better known as
the gentlemen from the
‘White House.’’ Napper and
Broome are the forwards and
they can both play. The
remaining question to be an-
swered is ‘Will Alfred Rhyne
be able to make the big layup
when it counts?”’

Ain't She It--All indications
show that this team is just
what their name says they are.
' There were a lot of other
people on some of the courts
during the three nights I was
here, but I could not discern
which teams the players were
on or what sport they were
playing. I guess it was some of
the bottom “B’’ Leaguers.

I must get on back to
Philly, so be sure to make
good use of what Mother
Nature gave you before Father
Time takes it away.”

Solid, Lloyd--now we know
why you play basketball. Next
week we will be back with all
the good ‘‘A’’League news
(including our _ infallible
BB-H-Man Top Ten) as well
as an award winning short
story entitled, ‘‘Where did our
coach go?”’ Later.
