Positive Attitude

Shapes The Experience

Liz says. ...

As much as I love this school,
itdrives mecrazy sometimes. Some
people stress out. Not me. I get
bored. I feel trapped. begin to feel
like my life is confined to a square
mile of land. Isee the same people,
hear the same stories, and have the
same small talk conversations. It
feels like endless deja vu, and I
begin to fantasize about transfer-
ring.

The boredom got to me fresh-
man and sophomore years. In a
sense, I wallowed in it. I talked of
living inLA, DC, New York, where
I would see new people every day
and have somewhere to goatnight,
something to do. My friends sym-
pathized, but they loved the school
for the same reasons I hated it.
They would probably hate the traf-
fic, smog, and crowds ofa big city.
They would hate a classroom of
300 people or fraternity parties with
guest lists.

This is what made me realize
how lucky I am. I realized that I
can either focus on the positive or
negative aspects of my experience
here. While I know that I will move
to a big Northern city after gradu-
ation, I also realize the merits of a
small school and a small commu-
nity like Davidson. When youstart
to feel stifled here, the answer is
not to fantasize about leaving.
Instead, become more involved.

This is your personal experi-
ence. Youcan make what you want
of it. In many senses, we have
more opportunities here than do
students of larger universities. For
example, Davidson students can
participate in intramural sports.
They can write on the newspaper
as freshmen, whereas at the large
school, senior journalism majors
might have to fight for the oppor-
tunity to write anarticle. Davidson
students can choose their eating
houses. We can even design our
own majors here.

Granted, Charlotte isnotmuch
of a city, and the court parties do
get old. However, the social scene
at any school gets old. Look to
your friends for support, and in
turn, support them. You may feel
stifled, but think of how it would
feel if they weren’t there. Think of
how it would feel if you couldn’t
go to your professors for help or if
you had no social life because you
didn’t get in the fraternity you
wanted.

I am glad I came to school
here, in spite of the fact I some-
times question my selection of
colleges. Graduation day, I will be
crying. I will leave with a new
perspective. Maybe all colleges do
this to you; I don’t know. But I
know that this experience will not
have been wasted. Sometimes its
hard to think like this when you’re
bored and frustrated. But as corny

as this sounds, a positive attitude
will do a world of good. This is
without a doubt the best cure for
the Davidson Blues.

Dair says. ...

We are all familiar with the
stress of college life. If you pro-
crastinate like me, you may end up
with two books to read and a ten
page paper tocomplete forthe next
moming. You need someone to
complain to, yeteveryone is on the
same boat. College students feel
this pressure throughout their four
years, yet at Davidson it is multi-
plied. There is no place to escape,
nobig city toexplore, no parents to
sympathize with your problems.

Despite the fact that there is. no
escape, there are many things you
can do to receive this stress. First,
relax and put things into perspec-
tive. Lay on your bed and listen to
some mellow music for an hour.
Or slam dance to Motley Crue.
Graba friend and go out fora quick
jog around the campus. Or con a
friend into giving you a backrub.

These can all relieve tensions
and prepare you for along night. It
is important to take study breaks
whether they are to the Union, Back
Street, B&E, or just to take a quick
walk. Spend about an hour on a
break not thinking about work.
Clearing your mind willallow you
to think coherently.

We all spend nights in the li-
brary or bonding with our comput-
ers. Don’ tlet friends partying until
the wee hours distract from your
work. You can join your friends
the next night when everything is
complete and all tests are taken.
Finally, try to plan in advance so
you won’t end up doing every-
thing the night before. This will
alleviate undue stress. Remember,
we all feel this stress, it’s part of
the life of a college student.

Welcome to the tale of
Davidson Environmental Action.
This is our fourth official year as
a formal committee, though the
group itself still remains in an
embryonic stage. I am Melissa,
co-organizer of “Davidson En-
Vitor son Te meen tea]
Awareness””...Hmm, soundskind
of like a reggae band, eh?

Our groups for the people,
by the people, all that demo-
cratic stuff. That means YOU,
Davidsonian subscribers, are the
heart of this group. Lookatit this
way: my cohort Chris and I are
your chauffeurs-- we have the
transportation (environmentally
efficient, of course), the gas

where to go... but don’t forget

(money) and the time. All you -
need to do is get in and tell us:

you have to come along. One of
our priorities this semester will
be writing informative articles
for the Davidsonian, and wed
love your help.

Now that Melissa’s done, I
just want to add one little note.
Since the writing of the bulk of
this article, we discovered th
in fact, Davidson Environmental
Action has a very, uh, tight
budget. Unfortunately, this
greatly limits our influence as a
campus organization, and cer-
tain measures will soon betaken
to remedy this problem. Now
more than ever Davidson needs
a strong student environmental
group, and I encourage éach of
you to become a part of this
growing organization.

sion in our cover-alls which turned
a lot of heads. We ignored these
unpleasantreactions and piled into
the front seat of Henry’s 1959 truck.
Although the work was challeng-
ing and strenuous, we kept up our
spirits and smiled over the pungent
odor of stale left-overs.

We carried our bags of slop to
the truck and emptied the contents
into the designated barrels. To my
amazement Henry allows the pigs
to eat bacon, pork and ham. In fact,
Henry said that they love it. I per-
sonally think that it might give
them gas. Once the slop is col-
lected Henry transports the con-
tents to his farm approximately
five miles from campus. Upon
arriving at his farm he leads the
various slop barrels on a cart and

takes it to a big cooking pot outside
the pig pen. he proceeds to cook all
the slop again in order to protect
his pigs from bacteria.

When the slop is ready, he
pours it into feeding bins where the
pigs partake of our left-overs. They
will always enjoy a salmon casse-
role that we turned up our noses to.
After a six to nine month “fatten-
ing” period the pigs are ready to be
sold at the market.

Eventually, Henry’s pigs will
be served to Davidson college stu-
dents enjoying a hearty meal at Ba-
con and Eggs. Henry says that he
will continue his “pig enterprise”
as long as Patterson Court will
provide left-overs.

As for the outcome of our
sociology project, Taylor and I
were the best pig-assistants Henry
had ever had (not to mention the
only ones).

Although it may be scary to
think about the first gynecologic
exam, it’s really nothing to be
apprehensive about. The exam is
something all women should have,
once every year. It’s the best tool
of prevention we have. Take ad-
vantage of it!
