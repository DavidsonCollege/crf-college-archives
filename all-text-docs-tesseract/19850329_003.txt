Bio- Engineering Seminar:
Class Teaches Technology For Informed Decision s

By TED WILSON

If you’re intrigued by how a
man with an artificial leg can run
across the United States, psychol-
ogy Professor John Brockway’s
Bio-Engineering and Health
Technologies class will fascinate
you. Brockway, who said he is
committed to giving students an
opportunity to-learn firsthand the
technology of our society, offers
the course through the Center for
Special Studies for the second
consecutive year.

“How can a liberal arts student
consider himself liberally edu-
cated without knowing the body
of knowledge known as technol-
ogy?” Brockway asked. He said
students “will be decision-makers
in ten to fifteen years . . . and will
be asked to make decisions about
technology in the future.” He
added, they “are not liberally edu-
cated if they don’t know what it is
about.” .

“Society is infinitely linked to
technology . . . We are bathed in
technology,” Brockway said. Fur-
thermore, he said, “strong ethical,
moral and religious overtones” are
involved with technological de-
velopments. He said students
need to learn the technology so
they can deal with these issues.

Brockway said Americans
today depend on sophisticated
technology to keep them alive and
to correct their medical problems.
“Society is aging. More and more
people require technology, in an
unethical way, to pick up the fail-
ure of the will. People expect
technology to correct the [failures
of] these wills.” For example,
when people know they can have a
by-pass surgery to correct dam-
age, they are less inclined to regu-
late their diet.

“Without technology we don’t
have a chance to make rational de-
cisions,” about such issues as
abortion. For example, the risk to
the mother of an abortion has
“gone from gigantic to tiny,” he

said. Since her life is less at risk,
“the person is more prone to make
a decision in a rational fashion.”
Hence, “technology enables clear
thought. [It] implies ethics, and
the development of ethics pro-
ceeds faster than it ever has in the
past.

Brockway emphasized “tech-
nology by itself is valuable. The
human mind gives the value to the
technology.”

Hence, Brockway is offering a
course in Bio-Engineering and
Health Technologies, the first of
its kind at an American liberal arts
school. Davidson was one of ten
schools to receive funding from
the Sloan Foundation to introduce
technology courses in the cur-

Liberal Ants Symposium:

Technology's Effects On Society

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

The “Symposium on Technol-
ogy and Freedom,” the fourth
symposium in the “New Liberal
Arts” program, will be held today
and tomorrow in the Chambers
Art Gallery. The symposium,
which includes a series of lectures
and discussions, will explore the
effects of computer, medical and
weapons technology on human
values and the world in which we
live.

Associate philosophy Profes-
sor Robert Maydole will open the
symposium today at 3:30 p.m.
with a lecture titled “Technology
and Freedom: A General Over-
view”. Maydole said he plans to
sketch three opposing philoso-
phies of the effects of technology
in his lecture.

The first view is what he calls
the “Utopian view of technol-
ogy,” which suggests that “tech-
nology is a kind of savior to the

problems that modern man con-
fronts.” The second ts “the anti-
technology view, which blames
the problems of the world on tech-
nology.” The third view, which
Maydole calls “the existentialist
view of technology,” maintains
that technology has to be fitted to

. the human condition. This view,

though less commonly asserted,
according to Maydole, is the one
on which he is working.

The symposium lecture series
schedule includes: a lecture titled
“Artificial Inteliigence and Inten-
tionality,” by Dr. Raymond Nel-
son, professor emeritus of philos-
ophy at Case Western Reserve
University at 4 p.m. today. Then
at 8 p.m. Dr. John McDermott,
distinguished professor of philos-
ophy and head of humanities in
medicine at Texas A & M Univer-
sity, will speak on “The Stethos-
cope as Talisman: Medical Tech-
nology as Loneliness.”’ Maydole

riculum. Davidson uses the
$250,000 grant to offer new
courses, sponsor six symposia,
and to hold two summer work-
shops, at which Davidson College
and Johnson C. Smith professors

learn about applied mathematics.
In addition to the Sloan Founda-
tion, the new course is financially
supported by the Mellon Founda-
tion, IBM, Charlotte Memorial
Hospital, and the College.

The course deals with five
major biomedical technologies:
MRI scanners, lasers, heart elec-
trophysiology, stage renal failure,
and innovative prosthetics. Stu-
dents visit Charlotte Memorial
Hospital where they meet physi-
cians and observe their work.
Brockway, who is writing a
textbook on the subject, stressed
there are no prerequisites for the
course but that some students, de-
pending on their background, may
need outside help in physics.

Because the course covers a
wide range of material, Brockway
said: “When I need expert help, |
turn to faculty members,” such as
Professors Burnett, Stell,
Thornberry and Christian, who
guest lecture to the class.

Furthermore, he said he chose
to emphasize medical technology
as “the intertwinement between
life and life quality is [clearer] in
medical technology” than in other
areas.

Enrollment this year dropped
from 22 to six students. Brockway
attributed this decline to a lack of
publicity until after the first regis-
tration period.

Brockway said, however, the
course “should survive” in the fu-
ture “because it has merit.” He
said he has written another grant
proposal for additional funding

from the Sloan Foundation, and

the College.has already scheduled
“Technology and Science” sym-
posia for next year.

Professor Discusses Sri Lanka

By NELLE McCORKLE

Calling the country “‘an inter-
esting case study in economic de-
velopment” economics Professor
Peter Hess spoke on “Lessons
from Sri Lanka” at Wednesday's
Open Luncheon. Hess visited Sri
Lanka with a University of Mary-
land ‘field study” in a six-week

predicts McDermott will take the
stance that, with medical technol-
ogy’s increasing sophistication,
part of the personal and human as-
pect of the medical profession has
disappeared.

On Saturday at 9 a.m., Dr
Carl Cohen, professor of philoso-
phy at the University of Michigan,
will lecture on “Technology and
Political Freedom.” Maydole will
speak on “Weapons and the De-
fense of Freedom” at 10:45 a.m.
A panel discussion and workshop
titled “Technology and the
Human Condition” at 1:45 p.m.
will conclude the program.

In addition to the original
funding for “The New Liberal
Arts” program from the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation, International

program during the summer of
1984.

Sri Lanka, a small island off
India with a population of 15 mil-
lion, ranks as one of the poorest
nations in the world per capita in-
come. However, Hess called the
infant motality rate a “more accu-
rate’ measure of economic de-
velopment. According to this rate
Sri Lanka is “one of the more de-
veloped of the third world coun-
tries.”

Hess praised Sri Lanka's long
history of investing in her
people,” but added that “rapid
economic growth” has not fol-
lowed. Since the late 1970s, when
a new government gained control
of the country, Sri Lanka has
shifted from interventionist poll-
cies to an increased reliance on the
market mechanism. Hess called
the current’ government “more
pro- West" than the preceding once,
but cited its dependence on for-
eign aid for development projects.

With I! other professors,
Hess visited a native development
project, the Sarvodaya
Shramadana. Literally, — this
phrase means “the awakening of
all in society by the mutual shar-
ing of one's time, thought and
energy.”

Organized in 1958 by A.T.
Ariyaratne, a Sri Lankan high
school teacher, the movement
concentrates on aid to the rural
poor. Based on Gandhian princi-
ples, Sarvodaya is now the largest

non-governmental organization in
Sri Lanka, with a “network of
educational and training centers”
including over 4,000 villages. In-
corporating, but not limited by
Buddhist beliefs, Sarvodaya ad-
vocates self-help. Sarvodaya em-
ployees and local volunteers lead
interested villages in work camps
Projects include road construc
tion, irrigation improvements,
sanitation upgrading, — model
farms, community kitchens, in-
noculation programs, and child
care centers.

Beyond the immediate appli
cation of Sarvodaya work pro
jects, the program incorporates an
enure philosophy of Third World
development. According to Hess,
this philosophy centers on the be
hef that development in the third
and fourth worlds need not follow
the the West”
Artyatne, he added, states that
“the strategies of Sarvodaya
are born of hard experience.”

American students are encour
aged to participate in the Sar
vodaya program, Hess said. Con
cerning American policy in gen-
eral, Hess urged increased and
“better-targeted™ aid to develop
ing nations. Campus Forum Com

Luncheons, commented, “I hope

rural development tn third world

models — of

countries.”
