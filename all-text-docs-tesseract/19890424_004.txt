By MUADI MUKENGE

The officers of the Davidson
Emergency Rescue Service
(DERS) have announced that
the squad will cease operation at
the end of this academic year.

DERS was established in
1977 to offer 24-hour emer-
gency medical care to the col-

ment.

He said that Mecklenburg
County’s MEDIC service will fill
the void left by DERS.

The squad was equipped to pro-
vide basic life support (BLS )—the
level of care thatmost ambulances
provide, but MEDIC offers full-
time paramedic-level care.

MEDIC is “first class,” accord-
ing to Moore, and provides ad-
vanced life support (ALS) whichis

The decreased call volume is
apparent in the disparity between
1985-86's 40-calls a year and this
year's 10 calls received.

According to Assistant Chief
Officer Jim Taylor, the decrease in
the number of calls may be attrib-
uted to a change in the character of
incoming classes.

“Davidson students are engag-

ior ata lower rate than i in the past,”

The alcohol-related accidents
so prevalent in the past have been
replaced by physical injuries and
illnesses such as epilepsy and dia-
betes, said Taylor.

DERS is folding despite a
strong membership of 30 stu-
dents. DERS is structured so that
there are two Emergency Medi-
cal Technicians (EMTs) and one
trainee on call atall times.

ROTC cadets place second in Ranger Challenge Weekend -

_ By GARY WHEELER

Davidson’s ROTC cadets placed an im-
pressive second in the Ranger Challenge
competition in Kullowhee, North Carolina
April 15. The nine-member team, led by so-
phomores Mike Peters and David Taylor,
began competing
at 6:00 a.m. and
by the end of the
event at 5:15
p.m. were just
two points shy of
first place.

The competi-
tion included six
team events:
physical training
test, weapons
assembly, hand
grenade throw-
ing, marksman-
ship, rope bridge
anda 10-kilome-
ter run. By the
end of the day
each cadet has
run between 10

‘and 12 miles

each. Inthe 10kilometerruncadets mustrun
with boots, a30-pound back pack and an M-
16.

“The purpose of Ranger Challenge is for
ROTC cadets to train on their own,” said
captain Taylor. He estimated that the cadets

spent 10 hours a week preparing for this
competition in addition to waking up at6:30
a.m. twice a week for physical training.

Western. Carolina hosted and won the
event, while Furman and Clemson were also
aici ‘by their ROTC divisions.
Davidson can only
choose its nine competi-
tors from its ‘sixty ca-
dets, but Clemson’s
ROTC has 250 mem-
bers, and both Western
Carolina and Furman
have over 100 cadets in
their ROTC depart-
ments.

In spite of the small
department, Davidson’s
cadets took first place in
the road race and the
rope bridge--events that
Western Carolina were
expected to win.

Individually,
Peters scored perfectly
on the physical training
testand George Sartiano
made a perfect score in

the marksmanship competition. Peters was
the only cadet in the entire competition able
to do 92 sit-ups and 82 push-ups in two min-
utes and to run two miles in less than 11
minutes, 54 seconds.

This year’s team included junior John
Black, sophomores Mike Peters, David
Taylor and Grier Martin, and freshmen
Jayson Phillips, George Sartiano, Mark
Swofford, Chan Shepperd and John Kelso.

According to Taylor, for the army “the
spring is a warm up for the fall.” In the fall,
the ROTC will compete against all North
and South Carolina schools with ROTC di-
visions. The teams that take the two top
spots in that competition will proceed to the
regional competition that includes teams
from Maine to South Carolina.

“Ranger Challenge is the ROTC’s second
biggest goal -- their first biggest is advanced
camp [after the cadets’ junior year], and it
[Ranger Challenge] lets the people who are
the best at what they do show off,” said
Taylor.

With this spring’s results, Taylor and.
Peters say they are “optimistic” that next fall
will be a time when Davidson cadets can
show off.
