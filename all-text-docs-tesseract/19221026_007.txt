excitement and at the same time, list

NEW HEATING PLANT
NEARING COMPLETION

Heat may be expected in abundance
within a short while for the new heat-
ing plant is nearing completion.

“The building is practically finished
except for the glass windows. The
stack is up, one boiler has been set, and
work has begun on the pipe connec-
tions, The new system should be in
a CRE RU within the next two weeks.

Meanwhile, should cold weather
come, the heat problem is solved. The
old buildings still have their source of
supply, while temporary pipe lines
have been run from the old heating
plant back of the Georgia Hall to the
new dormitories to take care of the
situation there.

The new plant is designed to furnish
heat for the entire campus and will ul-
timately be connected to all of the
buildings. At present, however, con-
nections will be run only to the new
dormitories, the barracks and the gym-
nasium.

took the kick-off and ran through
about six of the opposition like a
seared jack rabbit running for cover.
Jim shot past all but the safety man
like a flash then sidestepped the safety
man but was slowed up enough to get
caught after his great 50-yard dash.
That brought the stands to their feet,
kid, and then in about three minutes
Laird pulled his long distance run.
One of the biggest features of the
game, Joe, was the way the Techmen
didn’t gain around the flanks. Nappy
and Lias showed themselves to be
about the niftiest pair of wingmen in
this part of the country. ‘Twenty-one
times the Techmen attempted to circle
the ends and they came off with a net
total of 28 yards gained. In the Centre
game these same Gobblers tore off 88

yards around end or over three times

the yardage gained over Davis and
Faison. Centre has All-American Red
Roberts on one end and in one dash
around him the Gobblers gained as
much as their net yardage around our
flanks during the whole game.

Tech was holding Sutton in reserve
for the Maryland, Washington and Lee
and V. M. T. games but When the
Wildeats put up their game scrap in
the second period. in went Sutton and
in he stayed till the final whistle. The
Wildcats also made him look tame. On
cight trials the speed demon gained 28
yards and on" six attempts he lost 22
yards, Or to put the facts plainly, he
averaged one foot and four inches on
each attempt.

The punting of Bill Joe, Jr., saved
us in the last quarter, Joe. Two 50%
yard_punts set the V.-P.1. team back

considerable, “On the first punt Bill
Joe ripped off 50 yards and then got

down in time to assist Faison and
Davis in running Sutton back 15
yards on the return,

got a big welcome in
the final minutes and he saved the
game by his great tackle’ of Rhodes.
Then a place-kick failed and it was the
\Wildeats’ ball.

Spratt ll be in there to tear things
up in Greensboro next Saturday and
Trinity will be given the fight of their
lives by the gang. You’ve missed the
hest game of the season so don’t miss
the Greensboro serap. The big slogan
now is,

looks like the “old boys” are going to
get frocked. Vanderbilt seems to
stand prominent by virtue of her defeat
of Texas and tie with Michigan who
last week beat Ohio State by the de-
cisive score of 19-0, Vandy did not
lose last year,

Auburn’s great offensive is sure to
make her a threat to any team. but it
wouldn’t’ be safe to give~her any
bouquets until she has proved her met-
tle by defeating Ga. Tech on Grant
Kield Thanksgiving. Reports from
Auburn have it that that is just what
the Plainsmen are going to do this
Vee ar,

Closely bunched behind Auburn and
Vanderbilt: are Centre, W. and L., '
Georgia Tech, Georgia and Tulane,
and only a wizard could at this time
pick the best.

V. M. I.’s victory over Virginia and
North Carolina’s series of victories
might mean that these teams are com-
ing back on the big stage again. The
only thing to do is to wait and see.
