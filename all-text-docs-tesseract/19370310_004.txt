Davidson Gets Lawrence
Spearman as Asst. Football Coach

SPORTS AFIELD

Varsity Baseball, Tennis, Golf,
and Track Practice Begins

Prominent visitors to the campus
recently included two of baseball’s
“greats” — Roger (Peck) Peckin-

paugh and Lew Fonseca. These
two are now on their way north,
after an extensive tour of the var-
ious colleges and universities in the
south,

This tour is sponsored by
American League in an effort
carry instruction and advice to the
younger generation of baseball
players. It is, to a certain degree,
an effort to cement friendly rela-
tions between the public in gen-
eral and the major leagues.

According to Mr. Norman Shep-
ard, director of athletics, it
pity that the motion picture sched-
uled to be shown Monday was un-
fortunately forced to be cancelled.
He said these pictures were splen-
did, both as to general interest in
the stars pictured and as to the
instructional value.

Monday afternoon _ these
spent their time in advising,
structing and correcting the charges
Coach Flake Laird. From here,
they headed to Carolina, Wake For-
est, State, V. P. I., and others. Note
this—they aren't going to Duke.

Gridders Close

The gridders are winding up
their winter drills this week. From
the looks of things, the team “will
be about on a par with this year’s
eleven. According to present ap-
pearances Capt. Bailey Williams
and Bill Nicholson will guard the
flanks; Dave Warden and Lew
Graham will play the tackles; Hay-
wood Hill and George Matthis have
the inside track on the guards; Bob
Abell has been playing center, but
will get a fight if Frank Purdy re-
turns to school as he now plans to
do; and then Teeny Lafferty, Fred
Dennis, Bob McClellan and Bill
Beatty now comprise the backfield.

Do you know the difference be-
tween medal play and match play
in golf? A lot of people don’t. Well,
in medal play, the emphasis is laid
on every stroke and especially the
otal score. In match play, each
player plays his opponent on a hole-
by-hole basis; and the winner is de-
cided by who wins the most holes,
the number of strokes taken being
unimportant. This all arose from
the fact that the golf team is now
being chosen as the qualifying pe-
riod draws to a close.

Ground Rule

A screen will be erected in certer-
field on Richardson Field to facili-
tate playing baseball with the new
structure. All balls into the screen
are to be played as free balls; all
in the stadium Will be limited by
ground rules to two bases.

Remember to make your plans
now for Junior Speaking. It will

Thrilling Contest
Possibly the most exciting game

of the pre-finals was the Carolina-

Wake Forest encounter’ Friday
night in which the Demon Dea-
cons, trailing 22-36, with ten min-

utes to go, netted 13 points while
a single

that Carolina worked to beat W. &
L. in the 1936 finals. Carolina was
saved by the gun after the Deacons

Surviving this the Phan-
toms went into the finals against a
determined W. & L.
which held them in
throughout the hard fought 40 min-
Borries, and Iler
were the nidin cogs in the Generals’
attack. Big Bob Spessard starred
throughout the tournament, capital-
his graceful six feet-
seven to lead all scorers
with an aggregate 44 counters. The
smooth General attack was featured
by its bankboard work which kept
the Virginians in possession of the
ball in addition to the amazing
of points gained

previously won varsity letters or
freshman numerals in track will be

other spring sport, enter so that he
may get a line on any prospective
material for the track team

Each fraternity will be allowed
to enter two men in each event, of
which there are eleven. Only one
team from each fraternity will be
allowed to participate in the half-
mile relay. The twelve events

MANY REGULARS’ BACK

Sophomores Expected to Push
Veterans Hard

Once again the sharp crack of
ash against horsehide resounded
over Richardson field Monday af-
ternoon when the first regular base-
ball practice of the season was
fon Miko than twenty candidates
reparted to the call issued by Coach
Flake Laird, and this number is ex-
pected to swell to thirty when
spring football practice is discon-
tinued.

The most important feature of
the practice was the presence of
Roger Peckinpaugh and Lew Fon-
seca, veterans of many campaigns
in major league baseball and at
present sent out by the American
League to instruct collegiate base-
ball players, who were’ on the field
giving valuable pointers and cor-
recting faults of the Wildcat play-
ers.

After a snappy fielding an
ting practice, Peckinpaugh
Fonseca demonstrated the art of
sliding into a base with the mini-
mum of risk, pointing out many
tricks of the big leaguers in base
running, stealing, and hook sliding
into the bag.

Abundant Material

The abundance of good material
reporting for practice gives prom-
ise of a smooth playing team to
represent the “Red and Black” on
the diamond this year. Almost all
of last year’s regulars are back
along with a large number of prom-
ising sophomores. Coach _ Laird’s
main difficulty at present appears
to be pitchers. Veteran Herman
