Both the men and women’s
tennis teams had their first taste of
competition this past weekend. The
men sent three players to the Vir-
ginia Tech Indoor Invitational in
Blacksburg, VA, last weekend
while the women traveled to the
University of South Carolina for a
team match.

Holt Vaughan, Russell Briggs,
and Ryan Harper represented
Davidson in the 28 person draw.
Briggs entered the tournament as
the fourth seed, but was upset in
the second round by Joe Clemente
from the University of Richmond.
Harper fell in the first round to
Christian Imensek of the host
school 6-4, 6-2, who eventually
reached the semifinals. But harper
was not finished as he captured
three straight victories to reach the
finals of the backdraw before fall-
ing to Cleas Persson of Lander
University.

By far the best performance
came from junior Holt Vaughan,
who has returned from a wrist in-
jury that sidelined him last fall to

ans led the team.

Erik McMichael posted two
minutes for 800 meters, ranking
him among Davidson's top five
indoor performers ever. Duncan
Spears won his heat of the 400
meters in just over 52 seconds.

On Saturday the team contin-
ued their success against UVA and
Virginia Tech. Spears and
McMichael topped their perfor-
mances two weeks ago. Spears is
undefeated in his four years in heat
races at Virginia Tech.

Freshmen James Berry and
Chris Machon posted very good
times, while Eric Collings, Dave
Foss, and Clay Lenhart finished
three, four, and five in-the 3000

meter race. Joe Beach and Jeff.

play some of his best tennis.

He won his first match 7-6,6-
4 over Pablo Shuring of Virginia
Tech, and then had to face the #1
seeded Alex Lindholm from
Lander University. Vaughan stuck
it to his opponent from Sweden in
Straight sets to advance to the
quarterfinals. In that round,
Vaughan was outlasted in three
sets to Chad Toleafoa of Virginia
Tech 3-6,6-3,6-4.

“All the hard work has really
been worth while, especially when
you get a big win,” said Vaughan,
“It’s a reflection of how much
Davidson has improved, and the

_ win puts our foot in the door for big

time tennis.”

The women traveled to Co-
lumbia, SC, to face the #21 ranked
Gamecocks. South Carolina was
just too strong and Davidson lost
all of their matches. The match
was tough competition to begin
the season, especially since bad
weather has limited all play to in-
doors.

The women will return to ac-
tion this weekend in the Sth An-
nual Wildcat Doubles Classic that
will feature schools such as
Furman, West Virginia, NC State,
and Winthrop. The men ‘will have
their first team match when they
face East Carolina at home on Feb-
ruary 18 and then take on Virginia
the next day.

times and some new team records,”

own school record of 1:02.93 in
the 100 backstroke with a time of
1:02.45. Mari Mucha also set a
