Who Needs Conference Tournaments?

With the basketball season now into its final
month of play it is an appropriate time to look for-
ward once again to that perpetual nemesis of Southern

Conference basketball teams . the conference tour-

nament.

In a little over a month the NCAA and the NIT
will begin to weed out contenders for the national
titles until only the best are left.

But some of the best never get there, and this is
where the system tends to break down.

Much has been said, but little has been done to
remove the plighi of ine Southern Conference tourna-
ment, which by some freakish quirk can end up sénd-
ing its season cellar dweller to the NCAA tournament.

Certainly the number one team for the season in
the conference should be able to win the conference
tournament as well. But what if it doesn’t? Suppose
they got knocked off by a fired up team in the first
round? What then?

A lot of people tend to dismiss this idea, and
this year especially there is a lot of talk of how “no-
body’s going to get by Davidson.” Don’t kid yourself.
One needs only to examine the scores or the play by
play of Davidson’s games this season within the
Southern Conference to know. that there are plenty of
capable teams in the conference which could knock
off the Wildcats on a good shooting night.

But Davidson has won their conference games as
they were favored to do. They have proven their
strength thus far. Win as they have, however, they
have not earned anything yet. They must get by the
conference tournament next month. That's where the
whole season is won or lost.

0 happened befere. In 1964 a scrappy team from
VMI topped the nationally ranked Wildcats in.an early
round and went on to represent the. Southern in the
NCAA playoffs. Thus a team with a 12-11 season
record beat out the 21-4 Wildcats in the tournament.
The NCAA playoffs spelled disaster. VMI lost its first
round game to Princeton, 86-60.

There was no question that the Wildcats could
have done better. They had crushed Princeton earlier
that season. But the fact was VMI represented the
conference, and they lost.

This quirk of fate prompted sports writers all over
the country to re-examine the Southern’s set-up. Even
other schools came to Davidson and the conference’s
aid. Barry Jacobs, writing in the Tulane University
Hullabaloo that year, spoke of the “silly system,” say-
ing, “Not only is this system unfair to the rightful con-
ference champions, it is bad for the conference's
prestige. Instead of sending a strong team which might
win glory for the league, the conference sends out a
weak one and gets humiliated.”

The Southern is not the only conference with this
set-up. The Atlantic Coast Conference has its tourna-
ment as well. But they are the only two conferences
in the South that do, and in fact the only two promin-
ent conferences in the United States that do. Others
send either their season champions or employ a
compromise system.

The compromise system also utilizes a tourna-
ment. Under its set-up, however, the season champion
usually prevails. If a team other than the season
champion wins the tournament, a play-off is arranged
between the tournament champion and the season
champion. Certainly this is better than a single tourna-
ment in which a poor team can fire itself up into NCAA
playoffs.

Under the present setup the Southern Conference
is ignoring and throwing away what a team has ac-
complished over a long and testing season. One bad

"game can blow that entire season sky high.
It's time for the Southern to take a long, hard-

look at its long out-of-date setup. If a conference is
going to hold a post season tournament let it be only
for money and glory, and let the best in the conference
go on to the playoffs.

Otherwise what is the use in playing a season at

The quote of the week

sports editor Ronald Green,
who in a column this week
on all-American teams, said,
“North Carolina's Charlie

Maloy are the two prime
All-America candidates in
this area.”

He continued, ‘Both will

FIVE_IN DOUBLE FIGURES
High-Flying Hawkeyes Await Wildcats In Chicago

When the Wildcats invade Chi¢ago Stad

for them one of the best offensive ball clubs

in the country.

Averaging just over 91 points per game.
the University of Iowa Hawkeyes have
five men averaging in double figures, and
one of them isn't even a starter.

Coach Ralph Mifler’s squad is one of the
tallest in the Big Ten. and his squad has
run with some of the fastest teams in the
Midwest in piling up a 9-4 record.

Miller's two 6-7 forwards, John Johnson
and Ben McGilmer, are leading the Hawk-
eyes’ scoring, averaging 18.6 and 16.4 points

per game respectively.

The. team's sparkplug. 61 guard Chad
Calabria, is right on their heels with a 15.9
average. The other guard, 6-5 Glenn Vid
novic, is averaging’ 14.8.

The fifth man in doublz figures is sixth

Although Towa is a high-scoring team, it
does not employ a run ahd shoot offense.
The high scores have come largely because
of a 50 percent floor shooting average.

regarded O'Neill.

Drieseli turned on his best
recruiting charms, and to-
day Bryan Adrian is starting
for the freshman edition of
Wildcat basketball.

At first glance Adrian
looks like anything but a
basketball player, much less
a possible great. His slump-
ing shuffle-walk, straggly
mop-hair, and quiet, reserv-
ed manner tend to make
Adrian a by-stander when
off the court.

One glance ‘is all that's
needed when he's on the
court, though, to prove to
even the most inexperienced
basketball fan that here are
the makinge of a real super.
star.

Adrian, who has been de-
scribed by many 4s pro
bably the best shooter to
ever don a Wildcat bashket-
ball uniform, is realistic
about his position at David-
son. ‘Differeat players have
different duties. Doug (Hill)
is our ball-handler. Eric
(Minkin) covers the boards,
Lester (Strong) and Frank
(Clark) provide scoring and
board help, and my job is
to score. Davidson recruit.
ed me as a shooter and a
scorer, so I've got my work,
too.”

And Adrian does his work
especially well, scoring at a
30 point pace while hitting
on better than 50 percent
of his field goal attempts.

It wasn't always that easy
for Adrian. The youngest of
three sons of a New York
policeman, the going could
sometimes get rough.

“I started throwing the
ball at the basket when. I
was about five or six and
could hardly get it there. We
didn't have any of these lit-
tle league basketball teams
so most of the games I play.
ed were against my older
brothers and their friends."

Adrian laughs when re-
membering some of the
neighborhood pick-up con-
tests. “I was the smallest
so I was always chosen last.
I never could shoot the ball
correctly because one of the
bigger kids would block it.
I guess that's why I shoot
the way I do now.”

The way Adrian now
shoots, it’s nearly impossi.
ble for anyone, big or small,
to block it. His quick re-
lease and unusual ability to
get open with the ball, com-
bined with his own unique
soft-as-cotton shot. leave
many a defender shaking
his head while. two more

points are added to the
scoreboard.
“I like the Davidson

basketball program."' Adri-
an said. “I don't think that
{here’s any ‘better for me
personally. The material and
the coaches are good. and
they treat you big time.”

Standings Tighten
As Delts Top Nus

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor

The Phi Delits moved back
into the thick of the IMAC
basketball race Wednesday
‘night as they dropped the
Sigma Nus from the ranks
of the unbeaten, 63-47.

The Delts raced to an ear
ly 182 lead on the strength
of their offensive rebounding
and a sticky man to-man de-
fense, and the Nus were
forced to play catchup
basketball for the rest of the
game.

The shooting of the Delts
was not particularly good in
the first half, but they rare-
ly failed to get a second
shot as Gene Early and
James Brice controlled the
offensive backboards.

The Delts picked up their
shooting in the second half
and wrapped up the game.
Garth Hampton was six for
seven in the second half and
finished with 21 points to be
high scorer for the Delts.
Toby Westmoreland scored
22 for the Nus.

In, other games through
Wednesday the Sig Eps and
Pikas won as they beat the
SAE‘s and Betas respective-
ly. The SPE's featured an
effective man-to-man de-
fense and a balanced scoring
attack to whip the SAE’s,
66-52. Dave Shepler led the
Sig Ep scoring with 18
points while Wade Shepherd
and Kent Rhodes followed
with 16 each.

The Pikas trimmed the
Betas, 69.55, behind some ex-
cellent shooting and good de-
fense. Mark Affeldt led the
scoring with 23 points, nine
for 14 from the floor
and five for five at the line.

Joc Lansinger easily led
both teams in rebounding
with 11. Johnny Baker scor
ed 18 for the losers.

The Indies won their first
game surprisingly easily, 69
57, over the KA(s. The Indies
played 12 men, and the
scoring was so well balanced
that the only player to score
in double figures was Bill
Funderburk with 10, |

The ATO’s whipped the
Phi Gamms, 47 36, to bring
their record to 3-2.

“Davidson as a whole has
been enjoyable, too. Aca-
demically it's a great
school. However, sometimes
the socia} situation can real-
ly get to you, particularly
after living in a big city all
your life."’

“Since I've. joined a fra-
ternity and am getting a car
soon it'll get better, though,
T hope.”’
