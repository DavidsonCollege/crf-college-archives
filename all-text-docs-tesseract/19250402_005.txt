DR. PRATT, OF LOUISVILLE

(Continued from page 1)
in the use and application of talents with
which a person is endowed. * Dr. Pratt said
that a simple definition of Christ was what a
man saw in himself,

A last illustration of Dr. Pratt’s was the
habit of Samuel Taylor Coleridge of putting
marginal notes in books he had borrowed
from friends. These annotations enhanced
the value of the book far above its original
worth. -Christ can do that with a life. A
life loaned to Him will be returned complete-
ly annotated with possibilities and powers
that will make it count for service and Christ
in the world.

; MONDAY MORNING, MARCH 30 —B

Dr. Pratt gave a short but helpful talk on,
“Christian Ideals.” He pointed out that it
was of little importance what a person’s busi-
ness was so long as the business was gone
}into with high Christian ideals. “A. man
never rises above his ideals,” said Dr. Pratt.
| His real theme was that a person should
make money to live, and not live to make |

|money. “Aim high and work hard—and
}guide your life with the teachings of |
| Christ.”

God.” He began with the illustration that as
the explorer, McMillan, predicts a new Ice
Age, so, a new religious era is dawning upon
us. He gave as proof that twice as many
Bibles were sold in New York last year than
any previous year, and five times as many
religious books were in the United
States. For the reason for this, Dr. Pratt
said that it was due to the increasing mate-
rialsm of the world before the Great War,
but that this served to draw men back. He
pointed out that there never had been a time
when men were discussing the Bible and re-
ligion so, and it was all because men realize
their need of God.

“To hold faith in God is to make life vic-
torious,” said Dr. Pratt. “We must have an
intimacy with “God, we must believe in the
immortality of the soul, and above all must
know God as a Father.’ He closed his

sold

| powerful appeal to come back to God, the
| Eternal Father, with the statement that “this

is a weary world, meaningless, empty, if the
thought of a Father God is Withdrawn.”
