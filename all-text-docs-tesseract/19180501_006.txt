JUNIOR-SENIOR DEBATE IS
WON BY THE PHI SOCIETY

The Philanthropic Society was vic-
torious in the Annual Junior-Senior de-
bate which was held in the Eumenean
Society hall last Monday night. “Vhe
subject for debate was “Resolved. ‘That
Congress should enact legislation for
the ‘compulsory arbitration ‘of disputes
between organized labor and corpora-
tions, constitutionally waived.”

The Phi Society was represented by
R. ob. McClure, W. C. Neel and W.
ML. Currie. while the Fu Society was
represented by LL. M. ‘Thomas, A. S.
Potts and D. M. Orgain. A medal was
awarded to the best debater in cach so-
ciety, the medal in the Phi Society be-
ing awarded ta W. M. Currie, and in
the Muto L. M. Thomas.

The debate was snappy thruout and
showed that the debaters had put much
time and thought on the subject and
were well) prepared. Each speaker
brought out his points in a clear and
convincing manner, although some of
them indulged in a little camouflage for
the benefit of the judges,

The. affirmative brought out) as its
main points: (1) that voluntary arbi-
_tration has failed; €2) that the pre-
pesed amendment is necessary because of
the materialistic and econemic condi
tions: (3) that the preposed methad
will be a. satistactory remedy; (4) it
will be practical and could be enforced ;
‘it is logical; it is the method demanded
hy justice: it is the duty of the govern
ment to settle labor disputes.

‘The neyative admitted that conditions
are not altogether satisfactory. “Vhen
they showed that the proposed method
was unwise tn principle_and unust. to
the einployee and the public. “Phey also
showed that it was undemocratic . ‘and
would bring an, involuntary servitude.
Furthermore they showed that the pro-
posed . method would infringe on the
emplovers’ right of free contract. Be
sides this, they proved that it would not
stop strikes and cited as examples coun-
tries in which it has been tried. “Mhey
also stressed the fact that the afirmative
had based its arguments on hasty gener-
alizations and had net considered two
important phases of the question. “he
first of these was the difference between
arbitration and compulsory arbitration:
the second phase was that the question ‘is
stated, affected .only one-fifth of the la-
borers and hence could not be consider
ed a satisfactary remedy.

The judges of the debate were
Messrs. EX. W. Pharr, J. W. Keerans,
and Hamilton C. Jones, of the Charlotte
bar. .
