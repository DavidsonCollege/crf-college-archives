AERIAL ATTACKS COMBINED
WITH END RUNS WIN

The renowned bull-dog spirit of Yale
triumphed over the strong Harvard team
last Saturday afternoon at Sprunt Field.
In the championship game of the season
Yale defeated her strongest rival by the
decisive score of thirty-two to nothing.
This is the score according to. the official
score keeper, but as he had to stop once
to get a fresh chew, it is possible that sev-
eral touchdowns were scored in the in-
terim. The consensus of opinion seems
to agree on the score as given, however.

Long before the time for the game, the
waiting line began to form before the
ticket window, and when the gates were
thrown open the immense crowd surged
into the field. The huge stadium was
crowded to suffocation, and the authori-
ties had difficulty in keeping the specta-
tors within the side lines. Owing to the
care of the management the outrageous
charges of the ticket scalpers were in
some measure abated, altho many specu-
lators reaped fabulous profits.

The teams appeared about even when
they lined up: each had eleven men on
a side. Harvard had the more complex
system of signals; but this advantage
was more than offset by the number of
first-class bull slingers on the side of
Yale. .

From the initial kick-off till the final
whistle, it was a desperate battle, each
team striving to bring victory to its
colors. Many a day will it be before
Sprunt Field will see another such con-
flict, in which every player covered him-
self with glory, and good red dirt. Yale
possessed an aerial attack which soon be-
gan to tell on her opponents. We had
always suspected Yale had something up
her sleeve ever since the coaches called
for secret practice two weeks ago, and
we were not disappointed in the wonder-
ful system of forward passes which she
uncorked. Her other gains were due to
end runs that speedily brought her vic-
tory.

The punting was exceptional, some-
times the kicks going as far as twenty
yards. But tt was in the receiving of
the punts that both teams starred. Never
has such a perfect exhibition of the
fumbling of punts been displayed in this
neck of the woods.

Harvard began to brace in the last
quarter and made several good gains, but
was unable to score a touchdown.

Mr. Walter Camp, who was seen just
after the game, said it would be a dif fi-
cut task to pick an All-American team
this year, as every man on both Harvard
and Yale had starred.
