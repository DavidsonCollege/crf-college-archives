THE CITADEL GAME

Indications point to a hotly contested
game between the Citadel and David-
son next Saturday. Davidson is show-
ing up well and has gotten valuable ex-
perience in playing heavy teams, while
Citadel has played only a few collegiate
games, the last one being with the light
Clinton team on last Saturday, winning
by the score of 34 to 7.

The Citadel has a strong team, with
Crouch and Weeks as the outstanding
stars; Crouch for his line plunges, and
Weeks for his forward passes and end
runs,
