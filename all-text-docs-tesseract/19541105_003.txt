It was pretty shock-
ing! Since the renewal
of Davidson football
following the war, lo-
cal students and alum-
ni have seen quite a
few one-sided games
played on Richardson
Field, but last Satur-
day marked one of
those rare occasions
when Davidson has
been on the winning
end. As the Wildcats
racked up their fourth
; win of the season
against only two de-
feats, they ran up the
largest margin of victory for a Davidson club since 1947. Mid-
way through the '47 season, the Cats downed Hampden-Syd-
ney, 40-0. The last time that a Davidson squad scored over
fifty points was in 1946. That year the Red and Black rolled
Wofford’s Terriers, next week’s opponent, to the tune of 54-
0.

By JIM HOLSHOUSER

Almost anything you could think of happened last Satur-
day. For the first time this season, a Davidson back got off
on a run of over fifty yards. Barney Poole got the honor as
he hauled back a Tech punt for 55 yards and a TD. The Wild-
cat ground game hit its peak as Davidson backs consistently
hit the line and ends for sizable gains.

' From the tone of some of the spectators of the rout, an
outsider might have thought Davidson was taking another
beating, and the groans heard were for Davidson, but the
observers were no longer complaining about having a los-
ing team. Now they were mad because Davidson was, for
once, having a good day. It seems that the long, lean years can
be easily forgotten by some. Personally, we enjoyed the feel-
ing of being on the winning side.

The Cats set a minor record Saturday by winning their
fourth decision of the current campaign. This improved on
the number of total wins by Davidson clubs in 1951, 1952,
and 1953. The 1951 club won one game, the '52 team won
two, and last year’s squad went through the schedule without
a win.

HATS OFF

The Davidsonian hat is off this week to halfback Jim
Thacker. The Rome, Ga., flash finally hit his stride and on
four occasions showed his heels to Tech defenders as he
crossed the double-stripes. Thacker was the leading threat
of the Davidson ground attack during his freshman and sopho-
more seasons, and last year, his fine play was one of the
few bright spots in a dismal season. In pre-season practice this
fall, Thacker was injured and didn’t play in the opener against
V.M.L Returning to the Wildcat line-up, he failed to re-
gain his old form, and other members of the Davidson back-
field walked off with the laurels. Against West Virginia Tech,
however, Thacker returned to his role as Davidson’s most
dangerous man. On two of the touchdown jaunts, a less-
elusive runner would have been caught, but Jim slipped
around the Tech men in the manner that looked so familiar
to the Davidson upperclassmen who had seen him perform
in the same way so many times before.

SCHEDULE AT FAULT AGAIN

“Last season, the students had the dubious pleasure of
seeing the Wildcats at home on only three occasions, and
many complaints were raised on the subject. This year’s
card has improved along that line, including four games at
Davidson and one at Charlotte, with only four games played
away. The size of the crowd at the game Saturday showed an
error in scheduling this year. Though the west stands were
practically full, the east stands were not half-filled (for a
homecoming crowd, with alumni coming to the game, this
was a rarity). The reason was that only 20 miles away, Clem-
son and Wake Forest were meeting in Charlotte. The Char-
lotte fans naturallly stayed in town instead of traveling over
to Davidson. The faux pas in scheduling also Davidson
students the chance to see one of the better games in this
area, since Charlotte has few college games.

Cats Back On The Track
With Rout of W. Va. Tech

After losing thirteen consecutive Homecoming contests,
Davidson’s Wildcats finally broke the jinx last Saturday and
won a game before a Davidson Homecoming crowd. When the
Cats finally managed a win, it was one in which they pulled
out all the stops and proceeded to thrash the Golden Bears of
West Virginia Tech to the tune of 51-6. Using all the players
on the bench and calling freshmen players out of the stands

at halftime, Coach Dole used a total of 49 players in the rout.
ee After the first quarter, there

was no doubt in the minds of spec-
tators that the scrap could turn
out to be anything other than an
overwhelming Davidson victory.
The Wildcat backs ran wild be-
hind the savage blocking of the
forward wall, and throwing less
than ten passes, the Davidson club
ground out a total of 360 yards
via the ground.

The day’s longest run came in
the first quarter as Barney Poole
lugged the football for 85 yards.
Hauling in a Bear punt on the
Davidson 46, Poole faked a hand-
off, and then proceeding to twist
and squirm down the west side
line, seemingly caught by Bear
defenders on two occasions, but
finally breaking into the clear and
going all the way.

"54 Card Released

BY BOB PULLIAM

The 1954-55 edition of the hard-
wood Cats began practice last
Monday in preparation for a long
hard season beginning December
1 with Guilford and closing with
V. M. I. on February 26. The Cats,
under Coach Danny Miller, hope
to better last seasons record of
7-15.

‘Back from last years team are
such outstanding players as “Ish
the Swish” Bennett, 6'2" senior
forward, Hobby Cobb, 63” junior
forward, Ray Harding, the driv-
ing jump shot artist from Marion,
and Pappy “The Scrapper” Fowler
diminutive senior guard.

With these boys forming the
nucleus of this year’s team, Coach
Miller also has some fine prospects
from last year’s freshman team.
David Shaw, Gaylord Walker, and
Dick Weeks are probably the best
of the lot. These boys who led
the Wildkittens to a fine season
last year are expected to see plen-
ty of action with this year’s varsi-
ty.

Conference rule concerning fresh-
man participation may benefit the

out in early sessions, and a few of
them may provide the bench

With the records computed
through Wednesday, November 3,
the Kappa Sigs are standing on top
in the flicker ball competition. The
green-shirted boys have a 9-1 rec-
ord with only one game left on
their schedule. However their fin-
al contest is with the K.A.s who
have lost only two. Should the
KAs be the victors in that en-
counter, the league lead would
probably be thrown into a three-

presently have an 6&2 record, be-
ing the third party.

On the past Monday, the three
victorious teams met little opposi-
tion as they won their games by
safe margins. The ATOs ran wild,
scoring seven touchdowns to beat
the luck-less Independents, 52 to 6.
The Kappa Sigs increased their
number of wins by downing the
Phi Gams, 25-6. The Phi Delts held
their opponents scoreless while
running up 21 points for them-
selves.

Tuesday’s cold weather was too
much for the Pi Kapps and the

“Catawba Tough,” Say Coaches
Though Cats Are Heavy Favorites

BY LEON HOWELL

After the jinx-breaking homecoming victory over West Virginia Tech, the students here
at Davidson are confidently predicting a sweep of the last three games on the schedule. In
its quest for win number five, Catawba will be the foe, and Richardson Field the scene of

battle tomorrow.

Begin Preparation
For 1954 Season

Davidson's Varsity Wrestling
team began workouts last Monday
with an exceptionally large num-
ber of men turning out in answer
to Coach Charlie Parker's call for
grapplers. The list of candidates
for the squad now stands at 27.

Leading the number of returning
lettermen is Captain Johnny Bux-
ton, third-ranking Southern Con-
ference matter in the 157-lb. class
last year. Buxton will be the most
probable Davidson man to win a
conference crown this season.

Fresh and full of snap after
last week's rout, the Davidson
club will go into the scrap with-
out a single man missing due to in-
jury. The two platoon system will
again be employed, thereby tend-
ing to wear down a team with less
reserve strength.

Catawba had a potentially good
team at the outset of the season,
but injuries to key men have giv-
en them a poor record. Neverthe-
less, with a win over Davidson,
they would consider the season a
success. Remembering what Pres-
byterian did to us, they will hit us
in the same frame of mind.

Evidence that Coach Dole is ex-
pecting no pushover has been in-
dicated by the gruelling practice
sessions held this week. Although
his club is favored by thirteen
points, he is preparing for a rough
afternoon. ‘

Having seen them in action three
times, Coach Clements, a Catawba
product himself, asserted that they
had a particularly fine backfield.

GORDON MILITARY
DOWNS J.V.s

Priday, October 29, the Davidson
Freshman football team journey-
ed to Barnsville, Georgia, where
they played the Gordon Military
Academy. In the close match be-
tween the two teams, Gordon
emerged victorious 25-21.

Coach W. E. Acker when asked
about the game remarked, “In
spite of a couple of bad breaks at
the beginning, the boys played a
good game. We should have had
that one.”

The first time the Wildcats got
the ball, they played it but were
forced to kick. The kick was block-
ed, Gordon got it and ran for a
quick touch down. Gordon kicked
to Davidson and after three downs
the same thing happened again.

In the first quarter Gordon rack-
ed up another TD and led the
game: 19-0. Davidson came up in
the second and third quarters to
a@ 21-19 lead over the foe. With
only a few minutes left to play,
Gordon got another six points
pushing the Cats behind for a 25
21 defeat.

Outstanding for the Wildcats in
the Friday battle were Little How-
ard, Dave Fagg, and Ollie Harris.

Raleigh On Monday
For State Meet

Davidson’s Cross Country Team
travels to Raleigh on Monday for
the State Meet, the annual major
competitive race among the col-
leges of North Carolina. Sponsor-
ed by the Wolfpack of North Car-
olina State, which is the host team,
the meet traditionally pits the best
runners in the state against the
rough State course and the State
record.

This year’s meet will be a five-
team affair in the Varsity division,
with Davidson, Duke, North Caro-
lina, N. C. State, and Wake For-
est participating. There will also
be a freshman division since the
four Atlantic Coast Conference
teams are not allowed to use fresh-
men in Varsity competition. Da-
vidson will not enter the fresh-
man division since the Cat fresh-
men are eligible for the Varsity
under Southern Conference rules.

There will be an Open division
in which Service teams and col-
lege graduates will make up the
major part of the competition. The
favorite in this class will be Buz
Sawyer, former Southern cham-
pion who now coaches the N. C.
State harriers.
