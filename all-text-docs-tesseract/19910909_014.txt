at 4:00pm in the 900 Room, the
Campus Forum Committee is
sponsoring an open discussion on
eating disorders. A health profes-
sional and four Davidson students
who have eating disorders will talk
about their experiences and offer
ways in which friends may be able
to help.

Eating disorders are a preva-
lent concern on college campuses
across the country, and are’often
not recognized or discussed. Ev-
eryone has heard of Bulimia and
Anorexia, and though the discus-
sion will focus on these most
common diseases, there are many
other forms of eating disorders.

The following story is written
by a person who didn’t feel com-
fortable enough to speak but wants
to express their feelings about this
issue:

“This summer I was reading
an article on how to have an accu-
rate blood cholesterol measure-
ment taken. The article said that
cholesterol levels could vary
greatly according to how much
had been eaten. The writer sug-
gested that because of this people

should not have their cholesterol ©

levels taken just after Thanksgiv-
ing, or any time when there has
been more eating going on than
usual, because they would be unre-
alistically high. Levels should also
not be measured justafter a time of
fasting when they are misleadingly
low. In fact, the writer concluded,
you should maintain your normal
eating pattern for three weeks in
order to get an accurate reading.

I suppose, therefore, that it is
absolutely impossible for my cho-

ever. There is no way that I could
eat consistently for three weeks at
atime. My three weeks would be
made up of various combinations
of starving days and binging days.

Sometimes I think that my
eating is basically normal. I don’t
make myself throw up, I don’ttake
laxatives, I don’t starve myself for
days on end, I don’t exercise com-
pulsively, I don’t take diet pills. In
other words I don’t fit under any
label that society has assigned to
categorize various eating disorders.
But I think eating disorders are
much more pervasive than the small
number of people suffering from
these serious problems would
imply.

You don’t have to be bulimic
or anorexic to have an eating disor-
der. I think if you manipulate your
eating at all, you have an eating
disorder.

When a person feels hungry
they should be able to recognize
that they are hungry, be able to
identify what they feel like eating,
eat it, and then not think about food
again until they are hungry. This is
what I think of as normal eating. I
can’t do any of these things. I can
no longer identify when I am hun-
gry very well, because for so long
I have stressed to myself that it

doesn’t matter when I am hungry.
All that matters is when I am al-
lowing myself to eat.

Since I try never to allow myself
to eat, I feel an almost constant
“false” hunger because I know I
am going to be deprived in the
future. Of course when at last I
break the starvation, I totally binge
in anticipation of the next long

If your body is craving a certain
food, you should eat it whether it’s
fattening or not. The craving itself
is your body trying to tell you that
there is something in that food that
it needs. I try to eliminate certain
foods entirely not because I don’t
see them as things that nourish me
but as things that I have to restrict
due to their caloric content. Be-
cause these foods are off-limits, I
have created a “false” craving for
them. If I ever break down and eat
food from this forbidden listIeat A
LOT of itbecause tomorrow it will
be forbidden again.

It is also impossible for me to
stop thinking about food once my
hunger is satisfied. I think about
food constantly. I think about or-
ganizing, manipulating and con-
trolling food all the time. This
obsessive and constant thinking
about food is, I think, the real dis-
order.

Nobody tries to manipulate,
control or organize when they need
to go to the restroom. That would
be ridiculous.

You go when you need to go
and then you forget about it until
you need to go again. But it is just
as ridiculous and unbelievable that
so many people disrupt the natural

function of eating. Why do we do...

it?”

to a great many people on this

Research, Stress, and Celebrities:
An Intern's Inside Scoop on CNN

By Meredith Boone
CNN -- the network that brought
you the war. It was pretty heady
stuff for a summer job. Ill admit

that I was a little nervous. Broad- so.
cast News aside, who knew whatI_ |

was really getting myself into?

Some initial observations: the
employees at CNN are smart,
savvy, and above all stressed. Be-
cause of the major emphasis on
teamwork, I didn’t witness much
cutthroatcompetition. At the same
time, however, no one at CNN is
allowed to forget that he or she is
very easily replaceable. In other
words, if you don’t play as part of
the team, and you don’t do itextre-
mely well, you’re out.

Instead, the stress seemed to
originate from the highly driven,
almost perfectionist employees.
These people have a great respect
for deadlines, so in most cases,
everything is on time and ready for
air.

However, when unforseen cir-
cumstances occur: technical diffi-
culties, late breaking updates, ora
scoop of world-wide importance,
all Hell breaks loose. ;

I quickly discovered that, when
times get tough, it’s important to
do what youare told and stay outof
the way. Amazingly, even when
the pace was at it’s most frenetic,

the program on the air remained as
polished as ever.

This summer I was one of over
one hundred interns who worked,

reaus. My job in CNN’s Booking
and Research Departmententailed
helping to research the various
guests who came on the air and
writing interview questions.

If the guest came into the At-
lanta bureau for their live inter-
view, it was usually my responsi-

bility to make sure that the guest
was made up, happy and on the set
atthe allotted time. Asa result, Ire-
searched multiple interesting top-
ics and was
privileged

cinating
people.

“CHLAMYDIA IS.NOT A
FLOWER,” asserts the cover of
the chlamydia pamphlet from our
‘Student Health Services. In fact,
despite its strange sounding
name, chlamydia is the most
widespread sexually transmitted
disease (STD) in this country.
Unfortunately; chlamydia’s
symptoms are often mild or ab-

have devastating consequences.

‘The seriousness of chlamydial

personal hero, the King of the

without question, one of the nicest
people I have ever met. (Be sure to
check out the picture of B.B. and I
bonding in the makeup room!)

So, in sum, the summer was a
blast. Is it for everyone? I don’t
know, but if you get the opportu-
nity to work there, you’d be foolish
to turn it down. As an English
major, I enjoyed the research and
the writing. As an average person,
I loved the opportunity to salivate
over celebrities.

And finally, I enjoyed the rush
from the constant activity, along
with the instant gratification that
comes when. you hear a news an-
chor using your questionson inter-
national television.

Besides, where else could I
have worked and at the same time,
met my personal hero, watched
television all day, and kept up on
the latest gossip about Ted and
Jane?
