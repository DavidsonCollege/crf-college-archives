(For the past couple of
days, there has been an im-
portant guest on the David-
son campus. His name is
Lakshmi Kant Jha; he is a
Brahmin; and he is the In-
dian ambassador to the U.S.

He is altogether a fascinat-
ing man. He speaks Cam-
bridge English through
clouds of smoke from his
British-made cigarettes. His
voice is low and mellifluous,
obviously the voice of a cul-
tured man. When he. talks
politics, he speaks with con-
fidence .from a background
of long and varied involve-
ment in the mammoth ‘poli-
tical and economic problems
of his mammoth country.

He was educated at Cam-
bridge, during the time that
John Maynard Keynes was
writing there and support-

‘ing the school by shrewd in-

vestments. Jha. also studied
economics and then entered
the elite Indian Civil Ser-

_viee, at a time when British,

rather than Indians, were
preferred for the service.

He hejd important posts
in provincial administration,
and then moved into key
positioyis in. national govern-
ment? He has specialized in
the area which concerns In-
dia most — the economic
development of the country.

Now, at age 57, he is am-
bassador to the U.S., and
you need only talk to him
for a short time to realize

his eminent —§ qualifications

for that post. His attitude
toward the problems of. de-
veloping his country is
strengthened by knowledge
understanding, and optimism

The College of Wooster and
Callison College of thte Uni-
versity of the Pacific.

Unassuming as that pair
of schools may sound, both
represent levels of achieve-
ment for Frederick H. Gaige,
instructor of political science
and’ head of the Davidson
College South Asia program.

Wooster and Callison have
two of the finest South Asian
programs inthe country, ac
cording to Gaige, ‘‘but with-
in two ‘or three years, we
think that Davidson can have
one of the finest undergrad-
uate programs of its type
in the country.”

The progtess of the South
Asian studies program has
been a rapid one. In 1969,
when Gaige arrived to di-
rect ita development, the
only course on the subject
was a course on comparative
religions of South Asia.

Along with the growth of
the department has_ been
a parallel growth among in-
‘terested faculty members.
This year David Kaylor, Pro
fessor of Religion and Bible,
is in ‘India studying Hindu
ism,

This summer another nine
faculty members may study
in Southeast Asia, partially
under funds granted by the
federal government.

The administration has al-
so committed itself to the
acquisition of two additional
South Asian specialists for
next year, an anthropologist
and a linguist.

Gaige is-also attempting
to establish a junior year
abroad program in _ India.
John M. Bevan, Vice-presi-
dent for Academic Affairs,
began work on this in De-

cember when he spoke in:

Hong Kong at the Second
Asian Workshop of Higher
Education.

Bevan, as a former vice
president at the University
of the Pacific, has been di-
rectly connected with the es-
tablishment of the Callison
College program at Banga-
lore in South India. He spent
considerable time in’ India
working with the Indian edu-
cators overseeing American
academic programs.

Gaige sees this week’s
South Asian Festival ‘as

part of the development. of
the program. at Davidson
and a chance to stimulate
development of such _ pro-
grams at other _ schools
as well.’”’ Tomorrow’s meet-
ing of administrators may,
Gaige said, provide an im-
petus to interinstitutional co-

- operation in South Asian

Studies.

The word is out, the David-

A REVIEW
By MRS. AUSTRA GAIGE

Tibet has always been an
inaccessible, forbidden land,
exotic and mysterious, con-
sistently remanticized by
‘those who have studied it,

The impression has been
vividly reinforced by the
privileged _ few who have
heen admitted entry and by
the more numerous who
have gathered fragmentary
impressions about Tibet from
the refugees who have fled
to India and Nepal since
the Chinese takeover of Ti-
bet in 1950.

Tibetan art has not been
studied for long or extensiy,
Jy,.so it is perhaps presum)-
tuous to try to summarize
ttife art of Tibetan painting
in a few pages. However, this
exhibjt-_represents .a_ vision
so strange‘and complex, that
a mini-introduction is better
than none.

These paintings are call-
ed tankas and referred to: in
the west as banner-painting,
painted scrolls or prayer
banners. They are foremost
sacred and ceremonial ob-
jects which try to represent
the divine’ world of Tibetan
Buddhism, sometimes  call-
ed Lamaism. They are paint-
ed by monks in monasteries
according to iconographic
and technical rules prescrib-
ed by sacred texts. No other
type of painting could be
more wholly religious.

Generally, the focus of the
tanka is a central deity, sur-
rounded by lesser deities,
who are often variations of
the main figure. The back-
gound is ordinarily compos-
ed of scenes from the lives
of Tibetan saints and teach-
ers or. some_ geometric
framework such as the wheel
of life or the mendala form.

The ‘lamas who paint tan-
kas do so as an act of wor-
ship and not as-an act of con-
scious artistic self-expres-
sion.

Naturally, there is a wide
range of artistic quality.
Some tankas are-quite ordi-
nary in conception, execut-
ed with limited skill. Some
tankas are painted by highly
creative lama-artists, often,
only after the artist ‘has had
a visionary experience.

In any case, the lama-art-
ists do not paint for indivi-
dual recognition or material

reward, Their works are
therefore never signed and
only rarely dated.

There are a great many

tankas because of their uni
versal use in worship. Some
Westerners feel that the
widespread use of tankas in
Tibet. and the strict .canons
regarding their execution
have led to much sterotyped
reproduction. Some art his-

torians are amazed at how :

little repetition there is.
Unless we become students
of Tibetan Buddhism, and
learn to understand the in-
tricate subject matter of the
tankas, we are able to ap-
preciate only their visual ef-
fect. An indisputable attrac-
tion of these paintings is

their coloring—its boldness,
variety, contrast and har-
mony.

The composition of most
tankas evokes a feeling of
order, unity, and ' balance.
Another striking feature is
the elaborate, ingenious and
exquisite detail. There is no
perspective, little or no shad-
ing, all figures are contain-
ed by line or color, and there
is little unutilized space.

There are two recurring
themes evident in the tan-
kas on exhibit and in near-
ly all Tibetan painting

themes which are especially
foreign to us.

These are the terrifying
deities and the representa-
tion of divinities in sexual
embrace.

The ferocious deity is not
necessarily a devil or evil.
He may be a beneficial deity
who has assumed a wrathful
form for the purpose of ter-
rifying evil spirits or evil
doers. These are’ called ‘‘de-
fenders of the law” or ‘“‘pro-
tectors of the faith.” Other
terrifying deities represent
evil forces, depicted in order
that people may become
aware of their presence in

the world and placate them.

The use of sexual symbol-
ism may be explained by
its pervasiveness in all
mysticism, Tibetan Bud-,
dhism, like some other re-
ligion, has never tried to
deny that sex is the most
deep-rooted and powerful of
the human _ instincts. The
female deity symbolizes wis-
dom and the male-deity pow-

er or “method”? which is
utilized by wisdom. The
Tibetans call these deities

yab-yum, which' means fath-
er-mother, The two in union,
naturally, are also symbolic
of the creative forces.
