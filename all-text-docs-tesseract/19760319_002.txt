him in 1964 by President
Lyndon B. Johnson.

More than 40 colleges and
universities have conferred
honorary degrees on Father
Hesburgh as Davidson will do
this spring. ‘“‘The degree will
be symbolic of the desire for
Christian unity between Cath-
olics and Christians. It will
represent a new age which has
come,” said College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

The topic of Hesburgh’s
address is unknown at this
time, but Spencer ventured to
say that the topic could be
education, a field in which
Hesburgh has played a large
role.

According to Hesburgh, a
great college or university
‘*should be a community of
scholars, learning and teach-
ing and at the service of
mankind’s total development
in our day.

“It should be a place where
all the great questions are
asked, where the mind con-
stantly grows as the values
and powers of intelligence and
wisdom are cherished and
exercised in full freedom.”’

Along with Hesburgh, there
will be the normal recognition
of outstanding individual
achievements py the pre-
sentation of awaiis | However,
two awards will be added.

USC expects raised standards

The University of South Carolina is facing budget
restrictions and expects to be forced to raise admission
standards.

Required total scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test
are expected to be raised to 800 (out of 1600) in all colleges
of the university except the College of General Studies,
which would raise its standards to 650.

Ford allows CIA-School contracts

President Gerald R. Ford has permitted the Central
Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.) to enter into research
contracts with universities provided the school’s top

officials know where the funds are coming from. The

permission was granted in an executive order issued in
February.

In 1967 President Lyndon B. Johnson had barred any
C.I.A. secret funding of educational institutions. Johnson
barred the agency from such contracts after it was
revealed that the C.I.A. had secretly funded the U.S.

WHIT

National Student Association and other groups.

The Ford order allows contracts for ‘‘

classified or

unclassified research...provided the C.I.A. sponsorship is
known to the appropriate senior officials of the academic

institution..

Emory bans obscene flick

An Emory University showing of the film ‘‘The Devil in
Miss Jones” was recently canceled due to an objection to
the showing by the dean for student activities.

The dean reported that he had contacted state and
county legal authorities in order to find out if.the film was
obscene. The state attorney general’s office replied that “it

was explicitly obscene.’’.

The Dean then urged cancellation of the film, saying he
feared a police raid if the film was shown.

Clemson women invoke Title IX

Residents of five women’s dormitories at Clemson
University recently voted to abolish the ‘‘sign-in,
sign-out” policy which the university has imposed on its
women dormitory students. The students used Title IX of
the Education Amendments Act to force the vote.

Clemson has a policy of requiring women dormitory
students to sign-in and sign-out all male visitors to the
dorm. The university has no such policy for men.

Psychology adds internship,
Broughton fall term planned

one trip a week to Broughton.
Students participating in this
year’s summer program will
actually live at the hospital for
eight weeks.

Week one will entail orienta-
tion to the hospital, group
interaction, lectures and dis-
cussions.

The next six weeks will be
spent in actual contact with
the patients in a working
situation. Each student will
work under supervision as an
aide for twenty or twenty-five
hours per week.

According to Workman,
each student will do exactly
what a regular employee does.
This may involve bathing,
feeding, taking a patient into
town. Workman emphasized

AND TRUST COMPANY

MEMBER FDIC

that these actions bring the
students into the most direct
relationship with the patient.

The entire group will meet
four or five times a week, and
students will have occasional
conferences with the profes-
sor. Students will also be
participating observers in the-
rapy groups conducted by a
member of the professional
staff.

The final: week will be
devoted to more academic
work. Students will submit a
summary of their daily jour-
nals, with special emphasis on
suggested improvements in
both the hospital and the
program. A term paper will
also be required.

Last year twenty students
from Davidson and other col-
leges participated in the sum-
mer program.

The fall program will pro-
ceed much as the summer one
will, with few changes. Em-
phasis will still be placed on
direct contact with patients
and participation in ongoing
therapy. -
