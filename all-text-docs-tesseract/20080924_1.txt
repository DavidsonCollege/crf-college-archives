Town maps development

ANDREW EVANS
Staff Writer

The area around Davidson is
experiencing a tremendous amount
of population and economic
growth. In order to systematically
plan for this growth, the town of
Davidson has hired the Rhodeside
& Hartwell consulting group. This
first step was announced in a press
release on September 9.

“This plan is essential for the
town and will provide a road map
fof town government and residents
as we look to the future to meet the
needs of our citizens,” Kris Krider,
Davidson Planning Director, said
in the release.

According to Lauren Black-
burn, a Town Planner, the idea for
a.comprehensive plan for the town
of Davidson has been around since
the mid 90s.

Also, section two of the Plan-
ning Ordinance, which was ratified
in 2001, has a place for a compre-
hensive plan. The page, however, is
blank.

The town’s planning ordinance
is very strong and has allowed the
town to put off creating a compre-
hensive plan, although the town is
now getting to the point where it

needs a vision for how it is going
to develop.

When asked about who has
pushed for a comprehensive plan,
Blackburn indicated that this blank
section in the ordinance has been
speaking for itself.

She also said that Mr. Krider
has been pushing for it for four to
five years and that the planning
committee have likewise supported
the plan.

According to the press release,
13 different consulting teams were
considered for the job, but Rhode-
side & Hartwell’s team has “famil-
iar knowledge about local issues,”
Sara-Lynne Levine, Communica-
tions Director for the town, said.

This “familiar knowledge”
comes from two members of the
consulting team: Wade Walker,
a current citizen of the town, and
Meredith Judy, a former Davidson
citizen and former town planner.

The purpose of this compre-
hensive plan is to “tie together all
the other existing plans” as a sort
of “umbrella of all the plans” in
order to “map [the] growth of [the]
town,” Levine said.

Blackburn said that any con-

EAC promotes political action

MEIKAELA ZWIERYZNSK1

In efforts to increase awareness
and concern for environmental is-
sues in the current presidential elec-
tion, Davidson College’s Environ-
mental Action Committee (EAC) is
teaming up with PowerVote.org to
unite young people across the na-
tion behind the increasingly impor-
tant cause. -

Power Vote.org is a non-partisan
environmental effort led by the na-
tional Energy Action Coalition and
over forty partner organizations.
The group is focusing its efforts
and resources on attracting young
people across the nation to “vote
for clean and just energy” through
its Power Vote Pledge program.

Power Vote hopes to attract
one million young voters by Elec-
tion Day to demand that the new

Charlotte’s homeless

Last Thursday, the United
Community Action organization
(UCA), a service group on campus,
brought individuals from the Urban
Ministry Center (UMC) to speak.
The UMC is an inter-faith orga-
nization dedicated to helping the
homeless. The UCA sponsored the
“Faces of Homeless Panel,” where
two homeless individuals, John
and Gwen, from Charlotte came to
speak of their experiences and an-
swer questions.

John and Gwen were inspiring
in their short time speaking with
students. They have been together
for 20 years and married for four.
At the panel, the couple informed
students of their situation. The two
have been homeless for about a
year and four months.

John once was a chef, but after

two heart attacks and being diag-

nosed with diabetes, caused him to
take nine pills and two injections a
day, which ultimately caused him
to lose his job. John became weak
and unable to afford Medicare.

Gwen worked the night shift at
the airport part time, something she
was not use to, and one day she was
caught sleeping on the job and was
fired.

The couple informed everyone

green energy initiatives in the next
cabinet.

The power of the youth vote
has been a focus of the current elec-
tion, but has been approached very
differently by the two presidential
candidates.

While the success of the Obama
campaign seemingly depends on the
young voter turnout and grassroots
efforts, many would argue that the
McCain camp has yet to truly tar-
get voters age 18 — 24. However,
it is undeniable that the youth vote
could have a major impact on the
outcome of the election, and Power
Vote hopes to tap into that poten-
tial.

The website cites that voters 18
— 31 years of age currently make
up one fourth of the electorate, and
that this number will increase to
represent one third of the electorate

John speaks about his experience.

that one of the reasons they are
homeless is because of the Medi-
care system.

“We are out here because the
system is too slow. I’ve been turned
down three times for disability, but
we just have to role with the punch-
es,” John said.

However, John and Gwen were
not here to make people feel bad
for them, but to inform. “You are
tomorrow’s people.” John said.

“We are here to embed a seed
in your heart so that when you get
a job and can help [others]. You'll
know where the greatest need is.”

John informed the room that
Medicare does not pay for every-
thing, “Just think you guys are go-

Although personal concern for
the environment may drive many
people to support the cause, Pow-
er Vote cites practical reasons for
becoming a part of the movement
towards a nation running on green
energy.

In the midst of the nation’s cur-
rent financial crisis, the economy is
an obvious and serious concern for
all Americans. Power Vote states
that “investing in a clean energy
future will create millions of jobs”
during a time when young people
are suffering most from unemploy-
ment and a struggling economy.

“There is an increasing sense
of investment that [young] people
have in these issues,” EAC Presi-
dent Josh Carson ’09 said.

Carson noted that this change-

ing to be old too, and if they do not
fix social security you might not
have any to begin with.”

The couple does not have a
home to go to at night, but a side-
walk. Their nights become more
difficult when it rains, when the
homeless resort to a bridge, which
is the only time homeless individu-
als are allowed under the bridge.

The only difference between
John and a Davidson student is
that, “You have a key to put into a
door at night. We work and shower
too.”

has a felony, they cannot get a job,
