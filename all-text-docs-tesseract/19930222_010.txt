~Women Make In-Roads into Country Music

Continued from page 8

her best shot and shown us her
good stuff, which - don’t get me
wrong -is great. Butit takes a little
something extra to play with the
big girls.

5. Pam Tillis - - And speaking of
the big girls, Pam Tillis leads them
off. Ispoke at length about her last
week, and predicted last year that
she would keep climbing. Her
latest single, “Let That Pony Run”
is her fastest climbing yet on the
charts; and she’s coming off two
consecutive #1’s. Tillis has it all.
For overall entertainment ability
(stage, songwriting, singing, per-
forming), she is certainly one of
the best. |

4. Trisha Yearwood - - Last year’s
#2 is still delivering, but she hasn’t
quite been able to match the ladies
in the top three. She is one of the
most dominating female vocalists
you will ever hear, and can craft a
tune’s color to fit its subject - pas-
sionate, playful, desperate, som-
ber, or sexy . . . they’re all in her

repertoire. She is working on a
new, feminine and sexy image; but
is it working? Her stage presence
pales sadly in comparison to that
of the others in the top five.

3. Mary-Chapin Carpenter - - I
have charted her progress since
she hit the scene in the fall of 1989,
proclaiming all the way that she
was something special. I’m not so
biased that I would rank her above
this spot; but if you doubt the #3,
check her credentials. In the past
year, she has won both the Grammy
and the CMA for top female vocal-
ist, has appeared as a main attrac-
tion on innumerable t.v. programs,
and has captured the hearts of fans
and critics everywhere. In the stu-
dio, on the guitar, or on the stage,
she is an all-star, and has only
gotten better with each go-around.
Go out and buy Come On Come
On, her first platinum album, if
you don’t believe. She’s still wait-
ing onherfirst#1 single, but watch
for “Passionate Kisses” to put an
end to the waiting.

2. Wynonna Judd - - Last year, her

first single had just hit the radio; I
predicted number five out of the
bag and warned everyone to watch
out. Four singles later, Wynonna
Judd has leapfrogged all but one
female in country music. Her vo-
cals are probably the best in coun-
try (and have been for years); her
talents seem almost limitless when
singing ballads, the blues, or fast-
pace songs. Her songs have a life
all their own. Most surprising to
me was the fact that her abilities as
a performer and her stage presence
were magnified ten-fold when
Naomi left her to goitalone - looks
like she needed mama as much as
Chet Atkins needs guitar lessons.

1. Reba McEntire - - But there is
still only one Reba, and she is still
the Queen. She wins the gold star
for showmanship, for song quality
and diversity, and for the amazing
capacity to find new ways to sing
songs so that listeners never tire of
her one-of-a-kind voice. Despite
being around for almost twenty
albums, she even continues to win
awards. She is incredible.

Poetry ... By Jack Livings

cloudbank

never mind legend
or limp death,
be i dolphinskin or
cloud shrouded mountain,
the center of my being will
cry aloud for your
fingertips, always.
those reeds that
brushed aside this unsteady crane
like the touch of
leaf to cheek,
a line of blood,
a forgotten ring on
a motel room bed.
and together in
the shadow of oaks

{cranes

fold their wings

and become pinpricks
of memory.

clouds sag,

brush the trees,

and wrap slippery
tendrils around the
sun, choking it

with smoke grey
obscurity.
thunderheads swallow
floating cranes.

bleaching

I,

i consent to this rape,

this scouring of my veins.
and now i feel less. —
i’ve dropped my leaves
with the fall. they

are wet paper on concrete,
a poem, a whim,

a toothless smile.

Il.

they carpet your path, |

these my leaves.

some you had in your pockets
before the rains came.

ice nests my nooks,

my: hideaways.

i stand now naked.

Ill.

but, a request.

my leavess—

wash them

hide them quick!

do not kiss their lifeless
crumble.

steal their color,

bleach my leaves into
nothingness. :
sacrifice me to yourself.
taste my soul. -
