Stock market crash, U.S. bombs Iran’s platforms

By KATHERINE PRICE
Headlining events October 14-22:

In economic news — the Dow
Jones industrial average dropped
508 points on Monday, beating
the record set in 1929 by the sell-
ing panic’ of the Great Crash.
Economists speculated on the
likelihood of recession as well as
on worldwide repercussions from
the shock. While no one knows

for sure what will come of Mon-
day’s stock market panic,
economists. stress that the interna-
tional economic structure is vastly
different from that of 1929, and
that other economic indicators are
healthy. The Dow Jones average
bounced back by 102 points on
Tuesday in record-heavy trading.

Around the world — the U.S.
responded to an Iranian attack ona
U.S:sregistered ship by destroy-
ing two Iranian military plat-
forms. President Reagan stated
that the U.S. retaliation was prop-
ortionate to the degree of Iranian
hostility. Iran has vowed to strike
back at the U.S., which has re-
sumed its escort of Kuwaiti tan-
kers through the Persian Gulf. The

U.S. Senate voted to endorse

Reagan’s Persian Gulf policy with
“reservations” on Wednesday,
postponing any possible applica-
tion of the War Powers Act.
Costa Rican President Arias
won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize

for his efforts in establishing the

Central American peace plan.
Arias convinced all five Central

American leaders to sign the reg-
ional peace agreement, which
U.S. President Reagan has called
“fatally flawed.” The peace plan
calls for rebel cease- fires and an
end to foreign military aid and in-
tervention.

In the African nation of Bur-
kina Faso, Capt. Blaise Compaore
led a coup over Capt. Thomas
Sankara, to wrest control for his
“popular front.” The_self-proc-
laimed government promised a re-
turn to democracy.

Geiden Aliyev, the 64-year-
old protege of ex-Soviet leader
Brezhnev, was dismissed from the
Soviet Politburo. Health reasons
were cited, but many observers
speculated that present Soviet
leader Gorbachev was dissatisfied

Ortmayer quits ’88 presidential race

By MARGARET CARROLL

Tuesday night, Davidson’s
Chapel Committee hosted As-
sociate Professor of Political Sci-
ence Lou Ortmayer, who led a
lively after-dinner discussion on
the qualities of a good political
candidate. Much to everyone’s
shock and dismay, however,
Ortmayer announced that he had
decided not to run in the upcoming
presidential election.

After the discussion, students
raised questions regarding the
media’s’ role’ in politics, the. sin-
cerity of modern public servants’
and, most importantly,
Ortmayer’s plans to run in ’92.

Ortmayer opened the discus-
sion by passing a political cartoon
around the table. The cartoon
showed that the qualified political
candidate should have “no skele-
tons in his closet, no bizarre sex-
ual habits, no character flaws and
no political positions.” fy

¥ QOrtmayer explained that the
media is looking for the candidate
who has no flaws, but on the seri-
ous side, that candidate will also
be a “faceless, nondescript person
with no ideas.”

Ortmayer then explained four
important. qualities to look for
when examining a political candi-

date. One must note how the can-
didate has dealt with “road
blocks” or “insurmountable” .ob-
stacles. How has the candidate
reacted to frustration?

One must also examine how
the candidate has dealt with ex-
cess glory, which is inherent in all
political successes. How has he or
she managed to keep a clear head?
One must determine how the can-'
didate has dealt with political
“burnout.” How has the candidate
kept a balance between ‘engage-

ment and detachment? :*. -

Lastly, one must observe how
the candidate has dealt with the
“big temptation,” the presidency.

Can he or she be willing to make -

open choices and face the conse-

* quences? ©

On an even more serious note,

.Ortmayer noted that each of the

criteria can also be used in exa-
mining one’s own life, concen-

trating on abilities and ignoring |

superficialities. Ortmayer feels
that whoever wins the presidency
in 1988 will be forced to patch up
problems generated not only by

. the economic and diplomatic poli-

cies of the Reagan administration,

but also by the policies of several

preceding administrations. '
Ortmayer has withdrawn from

the ’88 election because he can
“hear the train’s whistle” from his
house (the train that has run over
many ’88 presidential hopefuls,
despite forewarning); because his
comment that North Carolina tex-
tile mills “need to import some
Poles” to improve efficiency was
not well taken by the public; and
because of unmentionables that
the media might dig up.

As for his plans for the elec-
tion in °92, Ortmayer thinks that
his chances of running are slim;
however, Davidson students can
only hope that he will change his
mind and embark on the chal-
lenge.

News media around the world
focused attention on the rescue of
eighteen-month-old Jessica
McClure from the bottom of a nar-
row well-shaft in Midland, Texas.
Workers dug a second tunnel
parallel to the one in which Jessica
was entrapped, and succeeded in
rescuing her sixty hours after she
fell in.

Across the nation — the House

Ways and Means committee voted
to recommend a $12 billion tax
hike. The tax increases would
primarily affect corporations and
the wealthy. The Senate Finance
committee voted to pass a similar
proposal. President Reagan has
threatened to veto any tax in-
creases. Congress and the presi-

SGA update

By ROBERT SMALLEY

The SGA Senate met Tuesday
night and discussed the proposed
academic calendars for the next
two years. As reported two weeks
ago, the Senate suggested that the
final day of the semester, a Tues-
