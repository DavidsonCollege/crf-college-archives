WORLD HONORS EDITOR

BROCKMANN WINS
TWO FELLOWSHIPS
FOR FURTHER STUDY

Henry Brockmann, former edi-
tor-in-chief of the Davidsonian, is
the recipient of one of the 50
fellowships announced ‘this week
by directors of the Danforth
Foundation.

This notification was immediate-
.ly preceded by the additional an-
nouncement that Brockmann also
has been awarded a fellowship by
the Rockefeller Foundation.

The Danforth grant specifies
that the winner shall enter the
teaching profession upon com-
pletion of sufficient preparation to
enable him to pursue this career
remuneratively, However, the Dan-
forth fellow holds this award for
life and may continue his own
formal education at the expense of
the Foundation at any time he
realizes the need of further in-
struction.

The Foundation has been created
by William H. Danforth, a leading
St. Louis industrialist, to provide
capitalization for a group of
scholars working cooperatively to-
ward degrees as Doctors of Philoso-
phy. The stipend attached to this
award may amount to $1800 un-
nually for single students and
$2400 for married students.

The Rockefeller Brother Theo-
logical Fellowship Program was in-
augurated a year ago for the pur-
pose of discovering and develop.
ing “new talent for the Christian
ministry.” The fellowship awards,
financed by the Rockefeller
Brothers Fund, are sponsored by
the American Association of Theo-
logical Schools. Expenses of room,
board, tuition, and monthly allow-
ances are covered by this fund.

state as well as representatives

from industrial firms through.

son, is president of the Academy.

Headquarters have been set up

Union and registration began this
morning at 9:00. Mrs. Little, super-
visor of dormitories has disclosed
that members of the Academy will
be housed in the new Belk dorm.

The main feature of today’s pro-
gram was a symposium on “Science
in Industry in North Carolina” held
in the ballroom of the Union.

Presiding over the symposium,
Dr. Puckett introduced the fol-
lowing speakers: Dr. D. E. Voyles
of the Duke Power Company; Dr.
William W. Bates of Liggett &
Myers Tobacco Company; tnd Dr.
Howard J. Phillip of the Celanese

day. During the session papers
were presented by college students
from, all over the state.

Winners Announced
In IFC Blood Drive

Winners of the Spring Blood
Drive have been announced by
the Interfraternity Council, spon-
sors of the campaign.

The champion bleeders during
the drive, held in the gym April
6 and 7, were those of the Pi Kappa
Alpha Order who participated in
the program to 97% of their ca-
pacity.

Ninety-one per cent of the Sigma
Chis also submitted to the needle
to gain second ranking in the inter-
fraternity competition. The cham-
pion Pikas earned a deduction of
$1 from the price of their Spring
Frolics dance tickets.

Belk Nears Completion

Treasurer of the college D. Greer
Martin has revealed additional
scheduling of activity concerning
the iminent completion of W. H.
Belk Hall.

The removal of the ROTC De-
partment from their old quarters
into the basement of the new
dormitory has enabled the con-
structors to labor feverishly on
both internal and external renova-
tion of the former ROTC building
so that the college workshop may
be housed therein.

This transfer cycle is currently
being completed by demolition of
the antique Stud whose brick
huddle has thus far marred the
symmetry of Belk Hall’s front
view.

The headquarters of campus cop
Linker have joined the shift of

OLD STUD IS DEMOLISHED
machinery and material from the

old Stud into the revamped mili-
tary building. The resultant debris
of the crumpled shell of the Stud
will soon be removed and laid to
rest elsewhere.

It is believed that actual build-
ing construction will meet the June
1 date for anticipated completion,
but grading and paving of walks
and parking area will not be
finished until September. Grass
seeding of grounds and setting out
of shrubs will be accomplished
during the fall planting season.

As yet, there has been no an-
nouncement of the date of the
projected demise of yellow, anti-
quated Georgia Dormitory, but it is
hoped that events will make such
a revelation possible in the near
future.

will begin at 8:00 with Dr. A. D.
Schaftesbury of Woman’s College,
Greensboro, vice president of the
Academy, presiding.

The feature-of the evening will

be the presidential address on
“The Regeneration Problem” by
Dr. Puckett. Announcements and
awards will also be made at the
dinner.
- Sectional meetings will begin to-
morrow morning, and meeting in
conjunction with the Academy will
be the North Carolina Psychologi-
eal Association of which Dr.
Donald K. Adams of Duke Univer-
sity is president, and Dr. W. G.
Workman of Davidson is secre-
tary-treasurer. During the various
sectional meetings, two Davidson
professors will read papers.

Prof. George W. Crawford in the
Physics and Mathematics section,
and Prof. Tom Daggy in the Zool-
ogy section.

Fraternities Planning
Weekend Functions

By JOHN BERNHARDT

This weekend is a big one for
most of the fraternities on cam-
pus, for seven of the eleven have
their spring functions scheduled
then. The only exceptions are the
SAEs, Sigma Chis, and SPEs, who
have recently held theirs, and the
ATOs, who will hold theirs -May
14.

The KAs will put on their best
southern costumes, rented from
Pennsylvania, for their Old South
Ball. Since. taking over Davidson
today, they plan to defeat Chariotte

cade through the streets of the
“Yankee” City.

After this heroic Armageddon
there will be a victory ceremony
at the courthouse reminiscent of
Lee's surrender at Appomattox
Court House. A lawn party at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Frank
Thompson will keep up the fes-
tivities until the climax that night
in the banquet and dance at the
Selwyn Hotel.

The annual Fiji Island Ball
forms the conclusion of the year’s
activities for the Phi Gams. This
year it will be held, appropriately,
at a cabin on the Catawba River.
In keeping with the title, the of-
ficial uniforms for the boys and
their dates will be South Pacific
class costumes. Besides the usual
dancing and swimming, other
Sports are expected.

For the Betas it will be tho
Bowery Ball as the big event of
the spring. In a den of mobsters
and underworld characters, they
will honor their departing brothers
with their Senior Banquet. After-
ward there will be much shady
action as the hoods and their molls
finish the night with a dance.

The Pikas will hold their annual
Dream Girl Ball at the Selwyn
Hotel in Charlotte. Music after the
dinner will be provided by Watt
McCain’s student combo. This is
perhaps the first time a group of
students has played for a frater.
nity dance, and it should give them
a good start in the performing
world.

The Kappa Sigs have reserved
the American Legion Home at Bel-
mont for their formal function.
After a barbecue supper, the
couples, dressed in Bermuda shorts
or slacks. will dance to os local
combo.

The Phi Delts will have their
Blue and White function at Honey’s
in Charlotte on the site of the Old
Time Grill. After the dinner, they
will adjourn to the dance hall ad-
joining it to spend the rest of the
evening dancing.

The Rose Ball of the Pi Kapps’'
will be held at the Red Fez. They
too will have a dinner and dance.

ager of the cafeteria, has an-
nounced that this will be a
Mother's Day supper.

cert Band Tuesday, May 10, at 7:00

MEET OPENS MAY 13

Davidson College is holding a
student leadership conference on
May 13 and 14 for leaders in the
rising senior classes of seventy
North Carolina high schools.

The purpose of this meeting is
for each delegate to receive bene-
ficial aid in the leading of his or
her high school in student gov-
ernment, school publications, social
and athletic organizations.

By exchanging ideas with the
other invited schools and learning
from able campus leaders of David-
son College these delegates will be
able to have well-rounded ard
well-planned school years in 1955-
56. Conferences like this have been
found very satisfactory in such
schools as the University of North
Carolina and Emory.

The planning and organization of
this conference has been placed in
the hands of a committee headed
by Doug Oldenburg. Serving on
this committee are Dan Lafar and
Bob Shaw, correspondence; Bunny
Perkinson and John Childs, pro-

gram and arrangements; Bob Mar-

tin, social; George Scott, discus-
sion groups and speakers; Gordon
Bondurant, housing; Boyce Martin,
finance; Bob Talbert, advertising

With smoke clearing the last |

issue had been officially defeated

negative vote of 21 Presbyteries

required to defeat the proposal.

has not been solved and is still in

unsolved is the concept of the
