THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1957

(All Unsigned Editoctals by the Editor)

Use Of Loud Speakers
Has Been Grossly Perverted

When the Wildcat Club decided
to install a loudspeaker system to
play the college fight song after ath-
letic victories, the idea met with the
warmhearted approval of everyone in-
terested in installing school spirit.
Here was to be a symbol of victory!

But, alas. the money is apparently
wasted, at least as far as last week
was concerned, for this source of
spirit had become perhaps the most
grossly misused item of equipment on
the campus.

When the Wildcats crushed Wof-
ford in the greatest upset in the
memory of the present student body.
the fight song blared forth but meant
almost nothing. for practical purposes
it could have been disregarded.

And why?—simply because that
sourid became just one smal! part of
the deluge falling from that famous
horn upon the now hardened ears of
the Davidson public. For days the air
had been filled with notices, announce-
ments, and strains of purposeless
music

It would be asinine to avoid the
use of such a device in getting late
news around in case of an emergency
such as a flu epidemic. but there is
no need to announce such insignifi-
cant items as the hour of some meet-
ing during Parents Day. Even notice
of Veterans’ Day, though worthy,
should go through other channels.

If the speaker was intended to pro-
claim victory on the athletic field,
then let us use it to proclaim victory
on the athletic field. Any and all
other uses only detract from its value.

Need And
Opportunity

Davidson College, as a liberal arts
college, is dedicated to the idea of
preparing men to enter into all phases
of professional life, and enter into
them more fully.

Increasingly however, Davidson
has turned from an institution which
terminates the formal education of a
man to one that is a stepping stone to
graduate work.

To use political terminology.
“let’s look at the récord.” Eleven Da-
vidson men have received the most
coveted of all academic honors. the
Rhodes Scholarship. Ten men have
won Fulbright Fellowships for study
abroad. And a half dozen have re-
ceived Woodrow Wilson Fellowships;
and there have been seven Danforth
Fellowship winners.

Four members of the class of 1957
received Teaching Career Fellowships
of the Southern University Fellowship
Fund.

Estimates now say that about fifty
percent of Davidson graduates con-
tinue their education in medical
schools. seminaries, and other types
of graduate school.

Three facts of importance stand
out. There is a great need for well-
informed, well-educated leadership
both in the nation as a whole. and
more particularly in the South.

Again, any student with a ‘“‘B” av-
erage or better will have no difficulty
in going to graduate school. There are
numerous fellowships offered, many

universities have graduate programs. .

and financial support for graduate
work is on the increase generally, as
witnessed by the fact that this year
the number of the Woodrow Wilson
Fellowships have been increased to
1000.

The faculty committee on gradu-
ate scholarships stands ready to coun-
sel any student interested in further-
ing his education.

Davidson's past record in this field
has been commendable. The future
finds opportunities for further edu-
cation exceeded only by the need for
educated leadership. A capable stu-
dent has an obligation to both himself
and his country to prepare himself
to meet the needs of tomorrow. Again,
we urge students to take advantage of

graduate school fellowships now be-
ing offered in many diverse fields of
study.—G.L.W.

Youthful

Privilege

Several of the resolutions passed
by the North Carolina Student Legis-
lature in Raleigh last week strike a
blow at what many consider a reason-
able sense ‘of good judgement.

The proposals that the student law-
makers passed at the “mock” legis-
lature are somewhat disturbing at a
first glance.

The initial shock, however, is tem-
pered when we consider that first of
all this was in truth a ‘‘mock” leégisla-
tive assembly—a fortunate fact!

We. should not overlook the fact
that at least two Davidson students ap-
parently kept their wits and were not
lured off base -by the left-of-center
thinking of their fellow delegates.

The second consideration that
eases the original shock is the thought
that what better time could there .be
than the college years to be radical?

One of the wonderful things about
youth is the privilege of being foolish.

Parents Day For
Upperclassmen

Parents Day for the freshmen has
proven worthwhile over the years. So
why not a Parents Day for upperclass-
men too?

A. Parents Day for upperclassmen
would give both parents and students
a chance to meet each other after a
student has formed his permanent
group of college friends—both stu-
dents and faculty.

During the Citadel football week-
end. the Kappa Sigma fraternity held
a Parents’ Day for its members. From
all indications the event was highly
successful.

We think that it would be a good
idea if the College Union would spon-
sor such a project in the Spring for
parents of all students—not just the
freshman. Or perhaps the various fra-
ternities would want to have their
own. In this case the IFC could co-
ordinate the event.

PETER AND THE WOLFE

CourtSnubsPublicOpinion
To Usurp Power Ot People

Dear Editor:

Willard Wolfe's “Letter to the
Editor” is typical of an Ameri-
ean philosophy today. Followers
of this school say, “okay, we've
got it. it must be right.” Such
pragmatic ideas have seeped in-
to our political thinking until
we now are quite willing to ac-
cept governmental action as al-
most sacred.

SUPERHUMAN

Those “men in Washington”
have taken on the role of su-
perhuman giants capable of kill-
ing any “Dragon” that confronts
our great nation. Their slogan
is “don't worry Children, Dad-
dy will protect you.”

Two or three very important
questions evolve from Mr.
Wolfe's article. In the first
place. what is precedent? Is it
not an acceptance by tne peo-
ple as well as the courts? In
the final analysis it is public
opinion that shapés the policy

of the government and the
sociological decisions of the
courts.

W.W., F.O.R.

Public opinion has been the
foundation of any movement or
reform in our history. Wilson
discovered this, to his bitter dis-
appointment, in his campaign
for the League of Nations. Even
F.D.R., with his great Congres-
sional influence, sought public

approval before any decisive
legislation was attempted.

No President has acted de-
cisively without first receiving
public sanction. Any politician
will tell you that. public opinion
can be his best ally or his
most bitter opponent.

Therefore, it seems that
precedent is powerful indeed,
but only as powerful as the peo-
ple wish to make it.

Secondly, isn't Mr. Wolfe
missing the point of David Law-
rence's editorial? The question
is not only whether the 14th
Amendment is legal and justi-
fiable, but also whether the
government can act despite the
people. The question is much
more complex than the Civil
Rights Issue alone; it involves
our whole outlook on demo-
eracy.

NINE CZARS

The problem basically is how
can the people keep control
over their government. Is it
now possible for ‘nine czars”
to usurp the power from the
people and also destroy the
balance of power in the govern-
ment?

Mr. Lawrence, in his article,
is not necessarily advocating a
repeal of the 14th Amendment
because he also realizes the
power of “stare decisis”, but

he is indicating what has hap-
pened and what actually can

happen. The Ratification of the
l4th Amendment occurred in
1868 when the National Govern-
ment was comparatively weak.
With a government that is
thousands of times more power-
ful, more centralized and more
positive, imagine what its in-
fluence could be today!

The matter Is not one of Re-
publican or Democratic parti-
sanship because elections today
seem to be a matter of “choos-
ing the lesser of two evils.” The
matter really is one of our
whole political future in demo-
cracy. When are we going to
stop worshipping governmental
action as holy and untouchable?
When will public opinion rise
up and demand the answers?

SPOON FED, BRAINWASHED

Mr. Wolfe, how much do you
know about our Satellite Pro-
gram? For that matter, how
much do you really know cbout
any of our programs? Only what
the government offers to tell
you and the other millions of
spoon fed, brainwashed prag-
matists who cry “whatever it
is is right.”

Is it not time for Americans
to awaken and see that the pic-
ture is not as rosy as the
“Artists” in Washington paint
it? The action of the 14th
Amendment is a good jndication
of what can happen to a “sleep-
ing giant”.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Dad's Advice to Freshmen;
Hocsak Report Called For

Dear Editor:

I am enclosing a sobering poem sent by a wise
Father, my Father, to his Freshman son who has been dis-
appointed at the outcome of his first grades in college. 1
thought that you might like to pass them along to your

interested Freshman readers.

Sincerely yours,
A freshman

“Did you tackle the trouble that came your way

With a resolute heart and cheerful?

Or hide your face from the light of day
With a craven soul, and fearful?

Oh, trouble’s a ton, and trouble’s an ounce,
Or trouble is what you make it,

And it isn’t the fact that you’re hurt
that counts,

But, only, How did you take it?

You are beaten to earth? Well, well,
what’s that?
Come up with a smiling face.

It's nothing against you to fall down flat,
But to lie there — That’s disgrace.

The harder you’re thrown, why, the higher
you bounce.
Be proud of your blackened eye!!

It isn’t the fact that you're licked that
counts;

But, it’s how did you fight and why.”

PEANUTS

PEANCIS

Dear Editor:

It was with a great deal of
pleasure that the Davidson Com-
munity received the Istvan Hoc-
sak family from Budapest, Hun-
gary last January. Their arrival,
made possible by contributions
to the YMCA’s Christmas Gift
Fund, caught the imagination of
the community and student body
at a time when Hungary was
front-page news and merited the
admiration of the free world.

This “Y” -project. was to be
one which the community and
students could continue to fol-
low and be interested in. No
doubt there are many students
who would like to have a “pro-
gress report” oh the Hocsak
family. .

—Scott Puckett

e e e e .

This is a good suggestion. The
Davidsonian will make a report
of its own. Perhaps an interview
with the Hocsaks plus a state
ment from the YMCA would
be informative.

COFFEE BREAK BREAK

As it seems to be the fashion
now to laugh at conformity here
at Davidson, let us see what we
must do in order to join the
growing clique’ of hon-con-
formiets.

In the first place, the main
rule is to assume the attitude
of the gripe. The negative one,
the griper, is obviously above
the rest of the group, or at
least does not let himself be
identified with those others who
like things as they are.

NON-SPECIFIC
DISSATISFACTION

For the politician non-con-
formist, one of the most im-
portant rules is to be non-spe-
cific. Dissatisfaction is a clean
indication that he is properly
possessed by the attitude of
the gripe. He is seen to be
clear-headed, progressive, and
ready for action. However,
there is no specific obligation
to do anything, and no one
group has its feelings hurt by
being singled out for criticism.

A seemingly contradictory
rule, but one which can be ap-
plied well to subjects of no
close personal connection, is to
be a campaigner. Leading cru-
sades can be dramatic and draw
much notice on the quiet Da-
vidson campus. However, a
danger hidden in this rule is
that of becoming a monomaniac
—such a single-minded cru-
sader that no one enlists be-
cause the campaign is too
hackneyed.

Handbook For

Non-Conformists

By JOHN BERNHARDT

These three rules’ sum up
briefly the Principles and
methods of the non-conformist
stoup. The factor common to
all of them is the spirit of just
showing others that the non-
conformist is not
Satisfied. ompictely

WHAT SEEMS RIGHT

There is, of course, a fourth
rule: to ignore the Opinion of
others in trying to do what
seems right to the individual.
This is much more difficult, be.
cause it is easier to Oppose than
to stand for an idea. The Jat-
ter takes a carefully worked
out set of values and a rational
appraisal of how the situation
fits into this standard.

To do this. one must think
through—independently — what
really seems important. and
what seems good; then follows
the necessity of thinking out
each action and opinion in
terms of the set of values, in-
dependent of the observations
of anyone else.

ELECT OF ELECT

But to be an individual is
harder than to be an individ-
ualist. For those who want to
leave the passe ranks of the
conformists to join with the
new elect, the first three rules
may be a guide, The independ-
ent, rational self-consistency of
the fourth rule should be left
by them for the elect of elect,
the ones who will not conform
to the cult of non-conformity.

FROSH over SOPHS

By PHIL LEWIS

Now that we’re back from Ra-
leigh, where we shocked the
sensibilities of the whole world,
and especially of Representative
Cooley by censuring Fauvbus and
such in the State Student Legis-
lature. maybe we can_ settle
back to the routine. Cooley did
contribute one good label to
the White House in calling it
the “Tomb of the Well-known
Soldier."

Stinky Stuart and his Fra-
grant Crew have been adding
that little something to the at-
mosphere in the Union. Need-
less to say, any change. there. is
an addition.

LESS THAN PERFECT

Speaking of the Snack Bar,
Lewis of that nether region
couldn't understand how the
service there could be consid-
ered anything less than perfect.
(But we know, don’t we?)

We can't understand why Wal-
ker, Lathan, Patton and Wilson

have been reluctant to comment
on their New York trip. We
know there are many exciting
things to do and see in the big
city. but their only comment
is “No Comment.” Why?

CLOSE VICTORY

The. Freshmen really showed
their mettle against a heavy
Sophomore Class Monday, and

“squeezed out a close victory

in the darkness of the lower
drill field. Lu Harvin and Clay
Robertson did some commenda-
ble organizing in preparation for
this feat. Dave Robinson's Sophs
kept their opponents on their
toes throughout, and threatened
to take the grudge match sev-
eral times, but the Frosh were
not to be denied. Much credit
for the direction of the events
goes to Fritz Russell and the
Upperclassmen who did such a
good job of umpiring the con.
test.

When in doubt...

President's Desk

By ROSS SMYTH
There have been, unfortunately, an increasing num-

ber of thefts around the campus in the past week, both

SMYTH

in the dormitories and in other places.
It is possible that the guilty party might
be a student or an outsider, and it would
be advisable, therefore, not only to be on
the lookout for persons wandering in

or around the dorms who do not belong
there, but also to avoid leaving valu-
ables or money lying around in your
rooms.

We have always been proud of the

fact that at Davidson we could leave our rooms unlocked.
but if the thefts continue, it would definitely be advisable
to lock your rooms when you leave them and to lock
your locker in the gym. Please report all thefts and the
observance of any outsider immediately to myself or to
any member of the Student Council.
