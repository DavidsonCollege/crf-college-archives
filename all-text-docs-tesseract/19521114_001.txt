Morton Addresses
IRC On Politics And

National Elections

Professor Frederick Morton of
the Political Science Department
spoke on the recent national elec-
tion at. the meeting’ of the Inter-
national Relations Club, Wednes-
day, November !2.

He gave several explanations for
the Republican landslide, stressing
the importance of Ejsenhower’s tre-
mendous popularity and the tact-
lessness of Truinan during the cam.
paign.

He was not convinced. that the
outcome of the election will mean
the rise of a “two-party” system in
the South, as some have suggested.
Instead, hie believes that the South-
ern people salfied behind Ejisen-
hower himself and not the Repub-
fican Party.

Professor Morton discussed the
future of the country and the two
political parties for the next four
years. An immediate Washington
turnover is scheduled for the open-
ing months of 1953 as Mr. Eisen-
hower brings in new appointees.

The speaker sees a sterner dip-
lomatic policy for this nation
against Russian aggression. Prob-
lems facing the new administration
include the possibility of total war
or economic recession.

Professor Morton and Dr, S. R.
Spencer will serve as faculty ad-
visers for the group this year.

Free Press

Probed In
Sunday Talk

What effect docs student criti-
cism of college policies have? How
much faculty supervision of stu-
dent publications should there be?

Questions such as- these will be
tossed back and forth Sunday eve-
ning at the YMCA discussion on
“A Free Press at Davidson Col-
lege.”

Dr. Wilson McCutchan, adviser
to Scripts ‘n’ Pranks, and Profes-
sor Fred Morton of the Economics
Department, will lead the discus.
sion. The editors of the college
tmagazine and The Davidsonian will
also make short statements ex-
pressing their views on the ques-
tion.

The bars will then be let down
for open discussion among the
group. Indications are that this
part of the evening will produce
some rather heated debate, since
opinions are known to differ wide-
ly among both students and
faculty.

The YMCA committee in charge
of the discussions has announced
the schedule for the remainder of
the semester,

Included are discussions’ on pre-
destination, led by Dr. Eberhardt;
fraternity rushing and membership,
led by Dr, Spencer and several
other faculty members; and the
admission of ‘Negroes to oouthern
college, with Dr. Workman = as
leader. Complete schedules are
posted on campus bulletin boards.

The meeting Sunday night will
be held as usual in the student
lounge of the church.

DR. W. M. THOMPSON

With the announcement of
the death of Dr. W. McIlwaing
Thompson, a deep feeling of
sorrow descended upon the
student body. For less than
two weeks ago, this man had
walked among us, and talked
with us. making his witness ag
a Christian felt on our campus.

Needless to say, we are
filled with .a- sense of regret
because of our association with
him. And yet, he wanted not
-our sorrow or our pity while
he was here, and for that
reason I do not think he would
want it now. Death for hith was
not a burden or a fear, but
rather, I believe, a time of re-
lease, enabling him to, go to
Him whom he had served so
faithfully.

He wanted not our pity. but
instead that we should have in
us that which wae in him.

On Wednesday, November 12,
the Executive Committee, com-
posed of Dr. Cunningham, Deans
Bailey and Brown and Professors
Eberhardt, Erwin, McCutchan,
Pietenpol and Purcell, released
their decision concerning the stu-
dents’ petition for the New Year's
extension.

Neither alternative was ac-
cepted. The decision was an-
nounced by Dean C. K. Brown
to Frank Hanshaw, editor of
_The Davidsonian, and’ to Bob
Henry, president of ODK, in
the absence of Student Body
President Jack Ruth.

Because it was felt that the
Executive Committee could more
adequately present the issue, its
interplay, and their decision, it was
suggested that they write the re-
port of that decision.

It was requested that all rele.

Trueblood Is
Otts Lecturer

Dr, Elton Trueblood, professor
of Philosophy at Earlham Col-
lege, will deliver the 1953 series of
the Otts Lectures early in March.

The theme of the lectures is also
unannounced, other than the as-
surance that the lectures will be
on. matters which. are of current
concern to the Christian world,

Dr. Trucblood will begin the
series of addresses at Vespers on
Sunday evening, speaking twice a
day thereafter until Wednesday.

Dr. Trueblood taught at Stan--
ford University before joining
the faculty of Earlham Col.
lege. He is widely sought after
as a speaker by young people
and laymen across the country.

He is-also a writer, his latest
book’ Your Other Vocation being
an October selection of the Reli-
gious Book Club. His earlier writ-
ings were mostly in an academic
vein, but in his later books he
has directed his ideas to men and

-[ women outside the schools.

An authority recently said,
in referring to him: “By birth
and conviction, Elton True-
blood is a Quaker; by training,
he is a philosophical scholar
with a Doctorate in Philoso-
phy from Harvard University;
by his personal decision, he is
a friend and counselor. of stu-
dents and youth.”

The Otts Lectures were begun in
1893 by Rev, J. M. P. Otts, D.D.,
LL.D., who established a fund’ for
securing distinguished speakers in
support of Cliristian faith.

Dr. Otrs himself gave the first
series of lectures. The most recent
lectures were given in 1951 by Dr.
J. Hutchison Cockburn under the
title “The Church and State in
Eastern Europe.”

Sig Upsilon Hears
Three Papers Read

The hoopla of the races, the de-
jection of a useless life and, the
workings of a big city slums—
these were the meat of the program
brought before the recent Sigma
Upsilon meeting.

Jim Moore’s witty letter to his
hypothetical girl friend on the sub-
ject of a Davidsonian’s off campus
education at the races held last
spring at Camden, S.C., brought
some comments of favorable note.

Tom Able, vice president of the
honorary literary fraternity, pre-
sented his short story on the reali-
zation of a life wasted. The old
man finally sees what all his years
in the shipping department mean—

The change is not -so simple as

Scholarship Race
Now Ready To Go

The Baker Scholarship Commit-

tee announced last week the open-.

ing of its annual competition
among high school seniors for the
George F. Baker Scholarships.

Five or six of these scholarships,
worth up to $4,800 cach, will be
awarded. at the close of the conl-
petition in the spring.

All qualified high school
seniors are eligible. Candidates
should excel in scholastic
ability, leadership, character,
and personality.

The committee has begun a cam-
fy its search for superior candi-
paign among the alumni to intensi-
dates. In a meeting of a number
of alumni chapter presidents last
Saturday at Davidson, the details
of the program were explained ‘to
the alumni.

Plans were then adopted for
the immediate establishment of
Baker Committees in each
chapter whose duties will be to
bring the scholarships to the
attention of superior students
in the chapter areas.

Students who wish information
sent to possible candidates should
give names and addresses to Prof.
B..D. Thompson; secretary of the
Eaculty Baker Scholarship Com-
mittee. All applications must be
completed by February 1.

Davidson's Dead

From Three Wars

Honored By S&B

By TOM WARLICK

Commemorating the day, 34
years ago, when the Armistice was
signed ending World War I, Scab-
bard and Blade presented a me-
morial “Armistice Day” program
on November 11.

Due to inclement weather the
program was held in Johnston
Gymnasium.

The ceremony opened with
a talk by Lt. Col. E. H. Davis,
PMS&T, himself a member of
Scabbard and Blade. A prayer
for Arniistice Day was then
led by Professor Iain Wilson
of the Bible Department.

The members of Scabbard and
Blade in full dress uniform
marched to a central position and
saluted as taps was blown. The
ceremony was closed by the play.
ing of the National Anthem, after
which the members of Scabbard
and Blade retired.

In his speech Colonel Davis
noted the number of David-
son men who made the eu-
preme sacrifice in our wars—
twenty in World War I, 159 in
World War II, and 5 in Korea
—a total of 184 in three wars.
“This is a heavy price to pay.

and wiring as well as building

the extension so as to accom-'

modate the new locations of
the kitchen and dining equip-
ment.

The extension will still be used
as a terrace and in the summer
will be opened cin: such a way a5:
to allow it to be of an open type
construction, while in the winter
the glass will be closed off allow-
ing that part to be heated and used.

Through the findings of the
management engineering firm
which is making the survey of
the college for its efficiency, it
was determined that the dining
and kitchen space in the Union
was inadequate.

Thus the decision to alter some
of the plans for the Union was
made.

Now it appears that comple-
tion of the lower level will be
delayed until Spring. This also
means a delay in the hoped-
for opening of the Union.
Grier Martin, in commenting on

the move, said that it was felt by
those who made the decision that
all who used the Union in later
years would benefit by this altera-
tion in the plans.

There is presently no date
set for the opening of the
Union, which was dedicated at
last month’s Homecoming, but
the delay is caused by more
than just the switch in plans.
The walks surrounding — the

building have not been laid and
certain parts of the first and second
levels have not been completed.

Mr. Martin and Mr. Smith em-
phasized that every effort is being
amade. to provide the Union as ade-
quately, as rapidly, and as close in
keeping to the overall needs of the
college as possible,

By HUNTER STRADER

Ac a meeting held last Wed-
nesday the Y Cabinet selected
a list of three projects for the
annual YMCA Gift Fund.
Various members of the Y will
present the projects to the mem-
bership of the YMCA during
chapel on Friday, November 21.

Immediately following this pre-
sentation the student body will
select by majority vote the project
they prefer.

The first plan is one of aiding
in a program of rehabilitation of
Korean amputees, which is being
sponsored by the Board of World
Missions in the Presbyterian
Church U,S. and by the National
Council of. Churches. The $4000-
$5000 would be used in providing
artificial limbs and in vocationally
rehabilitating the recipients.

Dr. Ruben Torrey of the North-

Tern Presbyterian Church, whose

son is a Davidson graduate, has
been selected as director of the
project, and “Dr. Paul S. Crane,
Davidson, ‘41, is to do most of the
surgical and orthopedic work in the
Presbyterian Chonju Hospital.

The need is indicated by the fact
that there are 30,000 civilian or
militry amputees in Korea today,
many of whom are children.

The second project involves
aiding the endowment of undergrad-
uate scholarships in the new Japa-
nese International University,
which will open its doors in April
of 1953, _

The university has been built. by
contributions from over 350 Ameri-
can colleges and universities and
other Christian organizations in
an effort to foster Christian edu-
cation in Japan. They are now
faced with the problem of insur-
ing financially needy students with
the opportunity of studying there.

General Douglas MacArthur has
said, “This proposed university with
its unique combination of Christian-
ity and education cannot fail to
play an essentially. important part
in Japan’s future. Its high purpose
entitles it every man’s support.”

Among its numerous supporters
are John Foster Dulles, ‘Cecile B.
DeMille, Gil Dodds, E. Stanley
Jones, J. Spencer Love, George C.
Marshall, and Chester W. Nimitz.

An orphanage in Palestine is the
focal point of the third suggested
project. The Cabinet learned of this
cause from Igor Sviatoslavsky, one
of our own foreign students.

Before 1948 the Syrian Orphan-
age in Jerusalem was under the
direction of Pastor Herman Schne-
ler, whose father had founded it
many years before. The orphanage.
had grown from a meager begin-
ning. of twenty children. into a
prospering institution of 1000, It
included a two-year seminary, a
variety of vocational schools,. and
a school for the blind.

When. the British left in 1948,
the Jews forced Schneler to leave
the orphanage and go over to the
Arab side, resulting in the loss of
about $5,000,000 in equipment and
property.

Herman Schneler is now starting
with branches in Jordan
and Syria. He has practically no

Drive Is

Success

Says Dagenhart

The United Appeal, according to
preliminary reports, is a success
on the Davidson campus in its first
year of operation.

Although fraternity reports are
not complete, a $500 sum at least
will be turned over to the Meck-
lenburg County Committee.

Independents and others who
wish to contribute should see Larry
Dagenhart in chapel Monday morn-
ing, and all fraternity reports
should be in by then also.

As was the original plan, little
was done to push the United Ap-
peal other than to ask for coopera-
tion from the fraternities and inde-
pendents. This policy paid off as
everyone got solidly behind the
drive on a voluntary basis and

pushed it over the top.

Though no goal was set, it was
hoped that $400 could be obtained.
The success of the drive is espe-
cially gratifying since students gave
not to reach a goal or as a response
to pressure, but because they
wanted to.

The first reaction to ‘the idea of
combining all charity drives in one
appeal was favorable, although
some opposition developed.

This was to be expected, how-
ever, for the same has been true
on the national level. Davidsonians
shdwed their general approval,
though, by their response in cold
cash, and so United Appeal will,
probably assume a permanent place
in ‘student activites.
