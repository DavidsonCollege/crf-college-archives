The debating teams of Davidson College
have made a better start this year,
prospects a more successful year than
ever before in the history of the college.
Only two debates have been held so far, and
both of these were won by a three to noth-
ing vote. The team which has spoken at
these two debates is composed of C. G. Davis
and T. G. McCutcheon.

credit and praise for winning the V, P. I.
debate, because of the fact that the debate
was held away from the Davidson campus,
and, in spite of this fact, the Davidson team
won by a unanimous vote of the judges.
The Davidson-George Washington debate
was held-at Davidson, and was especially
interesting and well delivered.
of this debate was, “Resolved, “That the
Volstead Act should be amended so as to
allow the sale of light wines and beer.” The
Davidson team upheld the negative side of
the question. The members of the visiting

Professors Watts and Harding Will

Read Papers at Linguist Conventions

Davidson will be represented by two of the
members of its faculty in the annual meet-
ings of two of the most highly intellectual
associations of Ameriea, which meet at
Harvard University during the latter days of
this month. Dr. C. R. Harding will go as a
member of the American Philological Asso-
ciation and Prof. George B. Watts will go
representing the Modern Language Associa-
tion of America. These two associations are
holding their annual meetings in conjunction
with the Archaeological Institute of Amer-

ica, College Art Association of America, and |

Linguistic Society of America. Although the
organization of these societies entirely
different, their purposes are all somewhat
along the same line, hence the various meet-
ings are heing held at the‘same place at the
same time.

Dr. Harding is on the program of the
fifty-eighth annual meeting of the American
Philological Association to be held at Har-
vard University, December 28-30. On the
afternoon of the third day of the convention,
Dr. Harding will present a paper to the so-
ciety of which he is a member, in joint ses-
sion with the Linguistic Society of America,
on “Subsequent Action Expressed by the
Aorist Participle.” t

The Modern Language Association will
begin its forty-third meeting.a day later than
the American Philological Association. It is
on the second day of this meeting that Pro-
fessor Watts will read his paper, “The Un-
published Works of Racine.” In addition to
his voluminous published works, Louis
