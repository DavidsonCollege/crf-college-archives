Since the last time I have gotten
a little besides the point when talk-
ing about the atmosphere and the
present student life at Heidelberg,
the university which I picked out
as an example. Let us now return
back to the buildings of this “alma
mater” and look around a little.

One of the main differences, that
you might ut once notice, is the
missing of a uni-
versity campus.
German univer-
sities do not
have a campus,
they are mostly
located in the
center of a town
an) consist only
of the adminis-
tration build-
° ings the lecture
halis, and the lab-buildings. The
students do not live in dormitories,
but in and around the town with
fari'es and in their own apart-
ments, This fact, of course, has a
great influence on the student life
as a whole, which is not so entire-
ly connected with the university as
the student life in America. It also
explains the missing of fraternities
within the German student life. 1
personally think, that the f-aternity
is found in no other nation, of the
western: nations at least, than in
America. But before getting into
- discussion about fraternities and
the German organizations that
might be compared with it, let me
first tell you a little about the lec-
turing system at the University.

As I said before, -you enter the
university after you finish your
high school education successfully,
that is, after you graduated from
high school with an A or B aver-
age. Until recent times it was even
then very difficult. to be matricu-
lated at any university, for the
veterans had filled the I:cture halls
everywhere. Then students used to
send‘ applications to ten or more
universities and if they were lucky,
they were accepted at one. This,
of course, has changed now and
things returned to normal, After
having sent your application and
being accepted or matriculated and
after having found proper quarters
in town, called a “bude” (digs),
you look over the courses of in-
struction and assign the courses
you would like to take. Up to here
there is not much. difference be-
tween the German and the Ameri-
can systems. The difference, how-
ever, begins when you come to the
system of lectures itself. After hav-
ing signed your name to the roll
of the professors you .would like
to hear and after having gone
through all formalities of matricu-
lation, you do not get in touch
with the university itself until the
time of exams. Up tilt then, no-
body cares too much whether you
attend your lectures or not, what
you do and what you study. You
are able ‘to stay away from lec-
tures for several days or work in
the labs all the time; it is entire-
ly up to you how you do your
work. The only thing you have to
do is to pass the semester exami-
nations. This is also caused by the
system of lectures itself. It is not
hard to find lectures attended by
200 students who al! signed for the
same course. It naturally would be
connected with many difficulties to
check the roll every time. It is also
tp to you, how many semesters
you study, when.yo specialize and
when you make your master’s de-
gree. Of course, there is a mini-
mum number of seines‘ers required
tor a masters deg-ee in a certain
subject, but there is no limit above.
If you fail a semester, you are, very
well able to repeat it, if you have
the money. Thus one of the famous
figures at many German univer-
sities came into being, the so calied
“student for ever,” a man who
studidd cvery semester 2 to 3 times
and just pas.c. his life, being a
student at all universities on the
continent. If you could afford it,
this was sure a wonderful life to
live.

The number of semesters for the
different master's degrees vary, as
I said before. The M.D. in medi-
cine requires a 12-semester study,
while the M.D. in chemistry re-
quires only 8, the M.D. in eco-
nomics 6 semesters. Of course, you
can study two subjects at the same
time, as for instance, Jaw and eco-
nomics and extend your studies
over a longer period. I am planning
to do this myself.

But the life at a university, as
all of ycn, I think, know pretty
well, does not only cansist of learn-
ing and Jab work. There are many
things going on besides that, some-
times even more important. The
German universities are not dif-
ferent, and also there the student
life consists of more than “crack-
ing books.” But I think it will be
a good idea to tell you about this
* next time,

University Ot S.C.
Has Air ROTC

Columbia, S. C., (IP) — One of
seventeen colleges and universities
starting the fall term with Air
ROTC units for the first time, the
University of South Carolina brings
to 127 the number of educational
institutions conducting Air ROTC
‘training in the United States and
Hawaii. .

The University's unit will spec-
ialize in Transportation, one of sev-
en types of specialized instruction
given at the schools, and the stu-
dies will include general adminis-
tration, supply, aircraft mainten-
ance engineering, armament, com-
munications, comptrollership, and
air installations.

Freshmen who elect to take the
course will be enrolled in the two-
year basic course. Students who
have had previous military exper-
ience and who otherwise qualify,
may be enrolled immediately in the
Advance Course usually given to
third and fourth-year ROTC stu-
dents.

Freshman classes will be taught
military orientation and study the
organization and operation of the
Air Force. These subjects are con-
tinued in the second year, with the
cadets receiving some instruction
in the specialized course. During
the third year the instruction pri-
marily concerns the subject mat-
ter of the specialized course, and in
the following summer the students
attend a six-week course at a sum-
mer camp at USAF installation.

The specialized course instruc-
tion is continued during the fourth
year, and ‘the cadets receive com-
missi@ns as second lieutenants in
the USAF Reserve upon comple-

” tion of their studies.

Plans: Chapel Play

Eu }fall was again the scene of a
spirited meeting of the Eumanean
Literary Society on December 5,
at 7:30 p. m.

President Chuck Kirby called
the society to order, after which
Vice President Ken Goodpasture
lead in a short devotional. The
roll was called, the minutes read,
and the floor opened for business.

Discussion followed on the
society's play to be presented in
chapel on Wednesday, the 14th.
An amendment was made in the
constitution to the effect that all
members missing three mectings a
semester without adequate excuse,
be dropped from the roll. Other
business concerning the meeting be-
fore Christmas was brought before
the society.

A short story was read by Mr.
Jim Campbell, who was then wel-
comed into the society.

Because of the Lateiner concert,
other papers to be read were post-
poned until the following meeting
and the critic's ‘report was not
Riven.

The meéting was then adjourned
by President Kirby.

A point is one-seventy-second of

of the 18th Century very little had
been done to standardize type sizes
and then an arbitrary measure was
chosen for a scate, divided into 72
parts, and the divisions were called

BLUFF-PROOF TESTS

Denver, Colo. (IP)—"If you
don’t want to work, don’t go to
college because you can’t bluff the
prof any more.” This watning to
lazy students was given by Dr.
William C, Krathwohl, director of
tests of the Institute of Psychol-
ogical Services of the Illinois In-j
stitute of Technology.

Speaking, in this city recently
before the Division of Educational
Psychology of the American
Psychological Association’s annual
meeting, Dr. Krathwohl outlined
testing methods which indicate the
results that can be expected from
students in English.

An index of industriousness of
any student can now easily be
figured from college placement or
orientation tests,

MEN ARE A MESS

Tf you smile at him, he thinks
you're a flirt,

If you don't flirt, he thinks you're
an iceberg.

If you let him kiss you, he wishes
you were more reserved.

If you don’t he'll seek consolation
elsewhere.

If you flatter him, he thinks
you're simple.

If you don't, he thinks you don’t
understand him.

If you let him make love to you,
he thinks you're cheap.

If you don’t, he'll go with a girl
who wilt.

If you go out with other fellows,
he thinks you're fickle.

Tf you don’t, he ‘thinks no one
will have you.

MEN—God bless them!
know what they want!!!

Don't
