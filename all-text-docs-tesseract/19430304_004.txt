Last week-end was reported to be

PHI DELTA THETA
The Phi’s were most active on the
campus this week-end due to an
on-campus function which was. hail-
ed as most successful.

The party consisted of a dinner,
after which the brothers and their

in song and various other amuse:
ments at the house. The merry party

Students and
Faculty Join

In Discussion

Compulsory Church Attend-
ance Discussed in Y.M.C.A.
Open Forum

“Should church be

compulsory at

attendance
Davidson” was the
topic of the open forum held in the
“Y" Jounge after the Vesper sery-
ice Sunday evening.

Before the general discussion was
held Drs. C. K. Brown and W. G.
McGavock of the faculty and Dick
Buddy Wells

body, presented their

Phillips and of the

student re
spective views on the subject.

Dr. Brown

Dr. Brown brought to the atten-
tion of the group that members of
the Davidson community are not
the students and the faculty, but
parents and alumni as well. Every-
one as part of a community is com-
pelled to do certain things for the
benefit of the whole of"the society.

As we must attend physical edu-
cation to develop physically, go to
classes to develop mentally, and live
with others to develop socially, so
Wwe must put the same requirements
on one outstanding phase of David-
son life, that of church attendance.

Phillips

Dick Phillips felt that compulsory
measures are not in the spirit of
Christ; that of the entire student
body one'third go because they
want to, ene-third because they are
on the campus, and one-third attend
the church service because they
have had to rush back to the campus
so as not to be marked absent. He
felt that there would be a better
spirit if those who felt compelled
to attend were not there.

Dr. McGavock
Dr. McGavock stated that his
ideas had changed from time to

time. Now as he looks back at the!

times when he felt he was compelled
to attend as a student he sees in the
service much good, and ¢ontends

athat church attendance is part of

Davidson spirit.

Buddy Wells also referred to
church attendance as part of the
spirit at Davidson, one of the out-
standing marks of our school.

Suggestions

The discussion which followed
concerned not as much compulsion
but more the way in which our at-
tendance could be handled. It was
suggested that a student pledge that
he had gone to church once on Sun-
day. In_opposition to this statement
were such retorts as stretching the
honor system too far and encour
aging participation in week-end
activities elsewhere.

The present plan, it was stated,
discouraged morning church by pro-
viding for the one-felt-necessary
church service to be in the eve-
ning, which was agreed to be not the
best habit for later life. It was sug:
gested that cards be printed to be
signed by the minister of the church
visited by the off-campus student,
ascertaining his attendance.

Personal Decision

It was observed that the majority
of students have béen made to’go to
church since childhood. It -is a
question of determining the time at
which they are to make their own
decisions, now or after college.

It was commonly agreed that
compulsory church is a worthwhile
requirement, but the student should
be allowed to go where he wished
and at the most convenient time
each Sunday.

Pop corn and marshmallows took
the spotlight. oa

Brother Watson and Pledge
Forbes, whose dates from Queens
were unable to attend the party,
remedied the situation by journey-
ing to the Friendly City.

Brother Pierce visited his home
in Farmville, N. C., while Brother
Jim Chapman pulled an extended
detail to his native city of Spartan-
burg.

Brothers Montgomery and Wad-
dill were the, dealers of the week
and came through with, two of the
fairer sex from Winthrop of ad:
mirable quality.

Dr. Gray is eager to meet with stu

to visit classes and contribute to the

Dr. Gray was born in London and
received his education at the Uni-

of British professional men and

and his numerous technical papers
give him background and purpose
to state the case for pure research.

Handcrafts
His scientific interests and ac-
complishments are balanced by ex-
perience” inmost of the so-called
“handcrafts”’ and training in both
metal and wood machine shop prac-
tices. He uses these techniques in
the manufacture of many of the in-
struments used in his research,

As a student he earned a living
as-a chef in Paris and stilt! regards
cooking as one of the fine arts. He
exemplifies, in short, not the de
tached scientist in pursuit of a single
goal but the very Auman individual
who finds in whatever he under-
takes another manifestation of civ-
ilized living.
