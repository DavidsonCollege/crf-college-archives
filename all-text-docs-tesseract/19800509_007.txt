DOWNTOWN MOORESVILLE

. (Continued from page 3)
wrote last week that Professor
Drake, the head of the sociology
department when he was hired
and the department chairman
for most of his time at Davidson
was never consulted during his
evaluation process.

But the Administration is not
solely at fault. The faculty has

_ Shirked its responsibility. Also,

if professors wish to criticize the
Administration, they must be
willing to actively participate in
the evaluation process.

Yet the faculty constantly
refuses to approve a faculty

evaluation committee which,

(: ontinued from page 1)
quired action by those not
wishing to participate. The
system for this summer’s bill is

“the only alternative,” Mary-
nowski said.
Comptroller Robert Davidson

said the problem is that PIRG
is an “organization apart from
the school, and it’s hard to
justify including the PIRG dues
on the bill’s total.’’ However,
‘‘we’re happy to collect the

_money”’ and include informa-

tion in the bill.

‘‘As long as it is parents
rather than students who are
confronted with the decision as

PIRG

would review appointments and
conduct evaluation independent
of the Academic Vice President.

Professors are afraid to judge
their peers or to be judged

themselves. But only by allow:

ing themselves to be publicly
scrutinized can they improve
and learn.

Students also are neither

critical nor skeptical, in part

because of Davidson's atmos-
phere. Professors often do not

strates any attempt for mean-

6 input. Yet student’s

it
e

to whether PIRG merits their
support, the number of Stu-
dents who take an active in-
terest is likely to be rather
small,” S said. i

Currently, the ‘Davidson

PIRG chapter is investigating
Representative Jim Martin’s

_ campaign funding, Marynowski

said. PIRG has not made any

other definite plans for next»,

year.

Approximately 10-15 stu-
dents are now involved in
PIRG, Marynowski said, add-
ing, “this is a fairly good size
number considering the type of

~investigative work we do.’
