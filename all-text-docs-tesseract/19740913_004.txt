Making Waves With 50,000 Watts

The Board of Trustees of Davidson
College and the station manager and

staff of Davidson Radio Station

WDAV appear to be on entirely dif-
ferent’ wavelengths regarding the
purpose and function of Davidson
broadcasting at present.

' WDAV, owned by the Board of
Trustees and operated by a:student
staff, has been an educational tool of
the college, both for those who serve
as its staff and those who listen for
information and entertainment.

Now the Board of Trustees appears
to be entertaining thoughts of
eliminating the student staff, feeling
that the purposes of the college and
community would be better met if the
college went into the broadcasting
business for itself with a staff of
professionals rather than Davidson
students.

For a college without a director of
finance or development at present,
the policy of hiring more ad-
ministrative personnel to drain the
college budget is highly questionable.
If the college cannot afford to build
Paul Rudolph dormitories or con-
struct new buildings for the art de-
partment, from where would the fi-

nances come to support a station to
compete with the likes of Jefferson
Broadcasting Company, owner of
WBT in Charlotte.

Yet the question which seems most
pressing is why the Board of Trustees
is desirous of replacing a channel for
students’ points of view with another
administrative function.

If the administration intends to con-
tinue its position that study of jour-

nalism lies outside the basic liberal -

arts curriculum which should be of-
fered by the college, a move to
replace students with professionals
simply serves to rob the tangible ex-
perience Davidson can offer students
outside the classroom.

We cherish the ability of WDAV to
use the broadcasting media to inform
and entertain this college community
as a student-run organization. The
prerequisite for establishing a new
professionally-operated _ station,
besides incredible sums. of money, is
the assurance that the student-staffed
WDAV FM station be allowed to con-
tinue its present services to the
oe community as a separate en-

y.

Sticking To Their Guns

or

Making Things Uniform

Returning students greeted the cor-
dial faces of Davidson policmen on
the other side of the I.D. camera.
Security precautions were im-
mediately in evidence. Some think
the evidence is a bit too graphic.

It is good to see the security officers
having a chance to see all the stu-
dents entrusted to their care. We hope
that memories will hold and that all
can go their merry way without un-
fortunate incidents that have plagued
us in the past.

However, the security arrange-
ments now involve more than a safe
community-of saints. Simply, what is
the rationale behind security officers
equipped with an array of weapons?

Isn’t it possible that the presence of
authority in a uniform-is enough to
‘‘protect’ and serve the student com-
munity?’’ The possibility of violence
presented by weapons is startling.

A curious and troubling mentality
seems to have crested in security

thinking.
An example: the back of the

brochure given all students by the

police provides a space for listing the.

serial numbers of firearms. College
regulations strictly prohibit students

having such items in their possession.
Someone forgot to tell the police, and
they certainly didn’t assume it on
their own.

Many of the security precautions
deserve praise. The service of prod-
ding students personally to register
their property is laudable. Campus
thefts have dropped dramatically in
the past few years. Mr. Sherril in his
amiable strolls is a constant source of
delight to garrulous souls.

Still, questions remain and need to
be raised. Is the presence of arms as
severe a threat as it seems? Is more
personal foot patrol needed in place of
the car-and-buggy routine?

The higher visibility of police
strolling the campus seems to us a
more effective deterrent of crime
than all the police cars equipped with
blaring radios, bubble-gum
machines, and shotguns parked out-
side of Richards House Snack Bar.

Perhaps the Precinct Two Patrol
could both strengthen security and
diminish the revolver, shotgun, and
nightstick overkill image by retur-
ning to fundamental footwork rather
than sticking to their guns.

Honor Code Triumphs
Over Nixon, Library

With the recent pardon of
President, oh excuse me, for-
mer-President Nixon, I would
like to add a few remarks to
Uncle Jerry’s decision.

What I am about to do is to
make the honor code stick.

Many freshmen at Davidson
are unaware of the fact that
Davidson possesses an honor-
code. The scene takes place in
room 228 Chambers. The
people present are members
of the Honor Council.

The discussion opens: “Just
because I broke into the
Dean’s office, I really don’t
think I should be punished.”’

“However, don’t you un-
derstafid that we operate on
an honor system here at
Davidson?”’

“Oh yes, I understand that,
but I was doing that for the
good of the law school which I
hope to attend next year.”

“‘Well, we must abide by the

rules, and those rules are:

steadfast in the heritage o
this college.” :

“Oh, you mean that I can
get off maybe in a few days,
possibly a week, for good
behavior, possibly a
presidential pardon?’

“No, my friend, those days
have long since passed us by.

665.24

. , .And remembuh,

You will pay for your crimes
in the most severe way
possible. You will not be able
to date a coed for the rest of
the year.”

Obviously, hae or.
just presented a
mridtik presentation of the Ford
Administration. Hopefully,
the Class of 1978 will adhere to
rules and regulations per-
taining to the welfare of
Davidson College. :

In particular, I-would like to
make mention to the new E.H.
Little Library which has been
recently constructed for our
continued study in ‘Do it
because it’s right.”’

“Sorry, Dick, go back to Go,
you do not collect $2 million
dollars for your memoirs.”

I abundantly applaud the
new library and what it stands
for. May the future classes of
Davidson College appreciate
what it has to offer in the way
of free reading.

And may those who abuse
the privileges that we SS
to use that library, go directly
to San Clemente.

Good night, Dick. Good
night, Mr. Little. And may all
you freshmen rest assured
that this month’s Playboy is
on microfilm.
