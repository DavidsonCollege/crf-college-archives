They tell us that the German mark

Temptation was bad enough at the

Ode to Dough-Balls.
There was an old maid from Dakota,
Who wanted board money I oda.
She thought it no joke,
That’s I was blum broke,
So into my biscuits went soda.

I bit the bread—and that which I utter-
ed
Came outer my mouth like it had been
buttered,
I wish 1 could tell
What she said, —but well,
Yow should have seen how she stutter-
ed.
