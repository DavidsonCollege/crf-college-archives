Among The Greeks

PHI DELTA THETA

A cordial invitation is hereby ex-
tended to all the Phis to attend a
“Little House Warming” on Mon-
day, the nineteenth. The evening ex-
ercises will be opened with a brief
play by the pledges which will be
foilowed by some jolly old fellow-
ship and recreation furnisned by
the brothers, and the pledge song
for the occasion will be “We'll have
a Blue, Blue Christmas.”

The Christmas Function might
have gone, but some memories will
live on for a long, long time.
Brother Pickard, for example, will
never forget that Sunday night in
the cotton field—that is if the boys
in the back room have anything
to do with it he won't. But love
is grand; isn’t it Dallas?

The party was held this year
in the Red Fez Club which
was decorated like an old western
hotel for the Occasion. The Phis
and their dates came as Forty-
niners (cowboys, Indians, and
Mexicans) but there was no. rough
stuff as Sheriff Sutton and tis
favorite deputy, Jo Ann, had every-
body check their guns. and tajia-
hawks at the door. Guff-Guff Hall
was’ toastmaster and after some of
the bovs’ wit and a good ‘meal,
everyone was ready to ease around
the floors a little. However, the
Roundman did raise a terrible gripe
when he found out there wasn’t
any dessert, but was soon consoled
when everybody at his table passed
down their scraps.

B. C. and Dot McLeod won the
prize for the best dressed couple
—that Klein was a_ real seed.
Special congratulations also go to
Fran Fulcher for, being selected
our sponsor for the annual this
year, ‘

Old Football Rules
Differ Greatly From
Present Regulations

Grinnell, Iowa (ACP)—Mr. Sam
Pooley, 81, mused about 1889 style
football for “The Scarict and
Black” of Grinnell College:

“It was a rough game. Back then
we didn’t have the downs system.
We carried the ball to a touchdown
or the other ‘team took it away
from us. A simple little tackle
didn’t put the runner down. You
had to pin him to the ground to
keep him from crawling across the

goal line.
“We didn’t play quarters, just
two 30-minute halves. We

furnished our own uniforms: jersey
pants, short jackets and Congress
shoes. No reserve teams sat on the
bench; only a few extras were on
hand in case someone was thrown
too hard. There were no substitu-
tions except for injuries. Of course
we somctimes. found it convenient
to have a man injured,
“Touchdowns counted four
points, the conver.on two in 1889
And to get the extra point you
had to kick from where the run-
ner went over. I don’t think foot-
ball was quite as rough when we
played it; we tackled hard, piled
up, developed cauliflower ears from
playing without helmets, but we
didn't have’as many injuries. Even
teachers played; Iowa had an in-

Peeping Tom?

PROFESSOR STARNES

Prof. Stames Is
Carolina Alumnus

Mr, W. R. Starnes, Jr., was for
two years before the war a student
at Duke Forest College. During
the war he served as a gunner in
the Eighth Air Force stationed
in England. At the end of the war

After being discharged from the’
Air Force, Mr. Starnes finished
his two years of undergraduate!
work at the University of North
Carolina.

Having received his A. B. degree
from Carolina, Mr. Starnes took
one year of graduate work at Co-
lumbia University. He is spending
his first year of teaching as an in-
structor in economics.

Commenting on his work here
at Davidson, Mr. Starnes said that
he was sujoying if very much.
Everybody has been very friendly
and coopérative. He stated that
both the administration and his
students have been extrenicly pa-
tient with him in his first year of
teaching. He said that he was very
grateful for this.

Two things have happened in
his classes so far that have been a
little out of the ordinary. He labels
the first as a good way to wake
up a class. Not very long ago the
desk in his classroom slipped off
the platform and made quite a
noise when it hit the floor, Mr
Starnes said that he was thinking
of this incident only as ‘an accident.
The other incident was, he is sure,
an accident. A few days ago, whiie
he was giving a review, a person
opened the classroom door and a
draft blew a boy’s paper out of
the window and into the class-
room below. The boy was in quite
a ‘fix’? until he retrieved his paper.

Mr. Starnes is originally from
Charlotte. He is not a member of
a social fraternity, but he is a
member of the Phi Beta Kappa
honorary fraternity,

Mr. Starnes is not married, but
Lhe: is looking mighty hard for a
wife. So far the ficld is wide open

Gargantua Is Dead

Gargantua, that awesome

monk, is dead. We have stood
fascinated in front of his cage.
He could have slapped Joe T.ouis
from here to there; for that mat-
ter, he could have whipped a
whole ring full of Joe Louises
before he got warmed up.

The difference between Gargan-
tua and a man, is that the man
exceeds the gorilla in brain and
spiritual power just as much ag
the gorilla exceeds the man in
physical might. The mind is the
measure .of man’s superiority.

The part of the mind which
entitles him to free will, is most
important of all. The most deli-

When Mouse was asked what

was held on the campus. The girls
stayed in the dormitories and had
to be in forty-five, minutes after the
dance was over, That was a rough
year.’

In an interview like this, for some
unknown reason people want to
know why the celebrity came to
Davidson, Well, in the case of Mor-
ris it was sort of a family tradition.
His fifth cousin on his grand-
mother’s side held Cop Linker's
position beiore he took over:

Since Morris plans to leave us in |
January, it seems only natural to
enquire unto his future plans. He
says he has a secret desire to play
in a bar or to be a stock car racer,

but he thinks he'll probably end
up pushing a broom in a cotton mill.
His experience doesn't fit him for
the first job—he knows how to
play the piano, but the bar would
be an unfamiliar cnvironment. As
for stock car racing, Mouse has
never had a = wreck—which of
course shows need of experience.

When Morris graduates in Jan-
vary, an era will end. For the boys
on fraternity court it will be the
end of Be Bop; for the boys from
Laurinburg, it will be the end of
transportation, and Morris. adds,
“For some of the boys on the
faculty it will be a relief.”

MASQUERS CONTINUE DESPITE
ILLEGITIMACY OF EXISTENCE

Every play given at Davidson is
illegal and always has been. The
charter of the institution still con-

In spite of this prohibition law,
on Thanksgiving of 1896, the stu-
dents’ Soc and Buskin Club pre-
sented a production called “The

son as a nrember of the English
faculty. Professor Erwin organized
a slramatic club in the fall of his
first year here and has been the
mainstay and mentor of campus
theatricals from that day to this.

The first production was the
“Wildcat Minstrels,” given at
Senior Speaking in November,

1920. Since then, classical and cur-
rent plays have been regularly: of-
fered. Not infrequently, plays writ-
ten by Davidson students have been
accorded as much success as
Broadway hits. A collection of local
offerings was printed in 1923 under
the title “Four Plays” and dedi-
cated to Professor Erwin.

For the first half dozen years
the plays appeared as the David-
son College Dramatic Club. The
title “Red and Black Masquers”
was adopted for the 1926-27 sea-
son and has been kept now for
over twenty years.

The Masquers are not a parasitic
organization, but an independent
group—solely devoted to dramatic
art on the stage and in the past -
years to that on the radio.
