Beyond Birkenstock

Hey, They're Finally Pretty Funny--Only Kidding Birk Kids

You ever wonder how some
people ever got in here anyway?
Take for instance, us. Now, in our
case, your surprise is probably
directed more at the fact that Har-
vard or Stanford wasn’t our first
choice. You’re no doubt posing
this perplexing question in dorms
and faculty lounges across cam-
pus: ‘““Why would two phenome-
nally intelligent. young minds: (as
the Birks obviously are) decide to
pursue their budding academic
careers in such an intellectual back-
water as Davidson College?” In
reply, both to you our reader, and
to our biographers reading this
column years . . . nay, centuries
later, “Because we’re modest.”
That’s right, plain and simple
humility. Just the same self-effac-
ing manner that our forebears, the
reigning European monarchy, once
possessed.

No, no... there is not the need
to bow and curtscy (for you girls,
this has become a lost art that will
stand you in good stead later in
life) whenever you see us. Al-
though it is acustom to greet visit-
ing heads of state (and various tin-
pot dictators) with a curt bend at
the knees, along the Japanese
model, it really isn’t necessary.
We're Americans, dammit--we

fought a war so that the American
peasant class (a. k. a. the “middle
class”) wouldn’t have
to bow and scrape

1) Do you find your hands
twitching mysteriously in class,

-not your biological parents, but
the cook and waitress at Bacon &
Egg?

4) Do you as-

every time one of their
social, intellectual, or
materially wealthy
betters came | along.
You may greet us as
Equals, displaying of
course the proper def-
erence accorded fig-
ures of our stature. Do
not attempt to hug us,
it is inappropriate.
Speak when spoken to,
andNO TOUCHING!

Back to the sub-
ject at hand, however.
What about all these
people wandering

J. Kyle Kinner &-
Seth J. McLaughlin

sume that “Chal” is
‘some nerd, since
you’ ve always heard
him mentioned as

being “in the li-
brary?”
5) Do you be-

long to a fraternity?
A woman’s eating
house?

6) Do you feel
relief that they’d still
give you a diploma,
“even with a 2.0?”

7) Are your
paper topics in his-
tory derived from

around here who just
don’t belong. As far
as we can tell, these folks cross
every ethnic and gender boundary.
Every region of our great country
has contributed at least one slacker
(although Georgia seems to have
enough to spare). Perhaps you too
are a member of the leisure set.
Curious?

Take our ten question test which
follows. Those of you who score
five and up are definitely SLACK.

"There Are More Than
Two Views to Everything"

By Rami E] Amine

I got pissed off the other day
when B turned to me and said,
“Only someone as PCas you would
say that.” in response to something
[had said which had nothing to do
with what is normally associated
with this idiotic PC debate. Look-
ing back now I’m glad it happened
because it pissed me off enough to
write this article which Ihave been
thinking about since the so called
“tensions” broke out on campus.

It was yet another example of
how most of you, despite the fact
that you attend what is supposedly
one of the top liberal arts colleges
" inthe nation, haveno mind of your
own. That’s why everything be-
comes a fad around here, no one
takes the time.to question our cul-
ture and society. This lack of a
critical mind has, in my opinion,
not only contributed to the recent
problems but prevented us from
dealing with them in an appropri-
ate manner,

Despite the fact that you had
time to observe and criticize the
- PC controversy’s detrimental ef-
fect on campuses throughout the
country over the past year or so,
you still managed to get caught up
in its superficiality.

Without pausing a moment to
analyze the situation in a rational

manner, people jumped into their
assigned roles (liberal or conser-
valive) and played them out ex-
actly as planned using the same
arguments and counter arguments
as those utilized by students on
other campuses.

However, my problem is more
with the liberals then with the reac-
tionaries since atleast the former
are trying to move forward and
address social problems. The prob-
lem with liberalism, on the other
hand, is that it lacks the critical
analysis mentioned earlier and
instead runs on emotion and sensa-
tionalism. Why do I say this?

First of all, if you who took the
liberal position were truly fed up
witha status quo which forces us to
conform to societal norms based
onracism, sexism, and other power
relations, the recentproblemscould
have been avoided.

Most of you don’t care about
how these problems manifest them-
selves in the larger society orin the
world, they’reonly aproblem when
they’re so close to home. This
clearly supports my assertion that
liberalism is not a genuine move-
ment for social change. Anyway,
how could it be when the majority
of its adherents (mostly middle
class and mostly wealthy) are as
much a part of the mainstream as

until you realize that they’re still
playing that troublesome third
quarter at Buffaloon SEGA® Foot-
ball?

2) Do you wait with barely
controlled anticipation for the
weekend when you can “finally
getsome rest” even though you did
no work, nor attended a class dur-
ing the previous week?

3) Are you intimately ac-
quainted with “Mom” and “Dad”-

the conservatives.
Multiculturalism will help
clarify this point because it is an
ideal middle class “fad”. It gives
people the impression that they are
achieving something socially sig-
nificant when they call homosexu-

als gay or lesbian, or blacks, Afri-

can Americans, or females, women.
It’s not that these are irrelevant,
but they don’t call for true social
action.

What ends up happening, and
has happened, is thatreal problems
lose meaning and begin to be
brushed aside as trivialities. You
have people like B. telling me I’m
being PC for something that had
nothing to do with true social prob-
lems. And even if I had been
talking abouta societal problem, it
would have lost all meaning when
someone dismisses itas something
Ipicked up in the PC game, instead
of explaining why he/she does not
feel that it is a problem.

My biggest problem with
multiculturalism, however, is that
its liberal adherents have resorted
to the same intolerance which we
have fought against for so long.
Those committed to challenging
the system of power should know
better than to call for restricting
anyone’s freedom of speech.

even more girls will attened

Davidson than guys mean that this
is your last hurrah. So go out there
and get some.

--Fianlly, why doesn’t the
Union Cafe carry medium sized

2% milk. I mean the half-pints are
cool, look at Laura Ingalls’ name
on “Little House on the Prairie.”
However, the whole situation
reminds me of buying a carrot.

-Youcan’t buy justone, youhave to

buy like ten. I guess the reverse
happens here. If I want to drink a
pint of 2% milk I have to buy two
of the little squirts while the un-

healthy Vitamin D drinkers get a

deal on the milk. I think there is a
little bit of a prejudice showing
through here. Oh, well.

Have a nice summer in your
boring ‘little jobs and remember
T’ll be living with what amounts to
12 Tri-Delts at Chapel Hill this
summer. (Now you know why I
want out of this place.)

themes that were
suggested to you by
Bill & Ted?

8) Are your parents footing
the bill for you to spend a year
“finding yourself” after college?

9) If you live down the hill, do
you routinely drive to class? If up
the hill, do you routinely drive to
the post office?

10) Are you a member of the
class of 1992?

If you answered yes to five or

more questions, regardless of your
GPA, then you are lazy. Its aharsh
word, we know, but the world is
even harsher. For those of you
who “do the best work between
2:00 and 6:00 AM,” try that sched-
ule out on your future employer.
And unless your new boss is a pot
grower himself (and how many of
us aspire to work for the drug cul-
ture), that’s another habit you’re
probably going to have to give up.
Old South? Try taking the kids for
aweekend of thatkind of debauch-
éry and see what social services
says. No, a family wants to go to
Disney World. And we’reall going
to have kids, aren’t we (some of us
probably already do)?

- The world of responsibility
begins, for some of you, the sec-
ond Kuykendall or Williams (or
whoever) hands you that diploma.
Notto throw a bucket of cold water
on your happy day, but unless you
have therare, parental golden para-
chute, you’re going to find that the
outside is a little bit more demand-
ing than even the vaunted
“Davidson Workload.” Yes,
you’re probably more mature than
you were four years ago, but you’re
also four years older. Time waits
for no” one; NOW GET TO
WORK!!!

suggested that as many as one in ten Americans is gay or lesbian, At
Davidson, that would mean well over a hundred, two or three per hall.
They’re probably everywhere! scary isn’t it? It’s a good thing we’ve
been able to suppress them. And you know what the scariest thing is
about them? They’re so much like us that we can’t tell who’s gay and
who’s straight. They like those study breaks in the Union just like we do.
They like to pickle themselves on the Court, just like us. They even like.
those late nights with ESPN that bring us all so much closer together.
They could be our roommates or those cool guys and girls we met at
Freshmen Orientation way back when. How could we handle knowing
that they weren’t exactly like us? I wonder why they haven’t come
forward. Didn’t they like those good “fag and lesbo” jokes?

It’s gotten so bad around the country that just about every other na-
tionally recognized college and university has accepted and activély sup-
ported institutions for gays and lesbians on campus. That could never
happen here. We couldn’t stray far from the principles and nineteenth
century moralism that this school was founded on, Think of the impli-
cations. It would mean accepting some things that we could never deal
with: premarital sex, dancing, the equality of women, oh, and, God for-
bid, ending slavery. Oh yea, we already lost that last one in a war a few
years back, so I guess blacks shouldn’t want anything else, either. This
school started out a small, regional backwater, and that’s how we want

it to stay, right?

Once again, I wantto thank those thoughtful Davidson students who
took it upon themselves to remove my flyers. I realize now that they
shouldn’t have gone up in the first place. I don’t know what I was
thinking. I just didn’t inhale that straight, white aroma deeply enough.

In the meantime, kick off your shoes and see how long you can stare
at your tootsies without cracking a smile. ;-)
