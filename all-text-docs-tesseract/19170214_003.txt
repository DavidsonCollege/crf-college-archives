OUR CONTEMPORARIES.

The Gamecock—A_ movement has
been started to erect a suitable memorial
to “Bob” Gonzales, the late distingish-
ed alumnus of South Carolina. The
disposition of the funds will depend
upon the amount raised. Among the
suggestions already made for the me-
morial are: The erection of a bronze
tablet. the purchase of a portrait for the
University chapel, or an endowed schol-

arship.

The Virginia Tech—The crack bas-
ket ball team of V. P. T. defeated the

frst time the Y. M. C. A. has heen

idefeated on their home floor in the past

five .vears, and incidentally it is the
largest score that has ever been piled ap
against them.
