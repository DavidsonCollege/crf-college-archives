ences with Sonny Bono, she convincingly
takes care of the men who run these busi-
nesses, advising them in practical matters
where theirs is all dreams and vanity.
Withoutasmile she puts in her time looking
out for these boobies, doling out common
sense with a tablespoon. When one of her
businessmen, Johnny Cammereri, pro-
poses marriage to her in the Grand Ticino
restaurant, she quietly asks, “Where’s the
ring?” She even guides him through his
proposal, telling him what to do and how to
do it. When he has performed all the rites
to her liking, she accepts. .
Thus is romance celebrated. She visits
Johnny’s brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) to
invite him to the wedding. He plays the
tragic hero as seen after the tragedy. Lonely
and suffering from his heartache, he falls
precipitously in love with her. Loretta,
however, needs a little convincing, hoping
to avoid any bad luck which put a sudden
end to her first marriage. He invites her to

see La Boheme at the Metropolitan Opera,
his passion, his outlet for the sentiments of
a poet maudite. Together they cry as the
lovers in the opera make their final goo-
dbyes in the snowfall under the “bella
luna.” And later that night they re-enact the
scene as Puccini might have done had he
lived in Little Italy in the 20th century.
Replete with New York accentuation,
under the huge moon and the light snow,
Ronny bares his soul to her, explaining in
sincerity and from experience why people
must needs fall in love with those who most
disrupt their lives. She tearfully embraces

his hand, forgetting all about bad luck and .

the man who gave her his pinky ring as a
pledge of his endearment.

Her father tries to add romance in his life
but goes about it all wrong. He buys lavish
gifts for his flame, Mona, and flatters her
with affectionate address while slighting
his devoted wife. When she finds out, she
doesn’t confront him with her knowledge
but sets out to understand why he must
cheat on her. She does challenge him
finally by asking, “Have I been a good wife

to you?” Without a harsh word she con-
vinces him to stop seeing his mistress. Then
she reassures him that, contrary to what he
thinks, his life is not founded on nothing,
but on the amore that they two share. Thus
love is celebrated.

Throughout the movie the family has
arguedand bickered, but nobody couldever
doubt their true affection for each other.
They can never tell their sentiments hon-
estly but instead communicate through the
guise of tactless advice and insults soothed
by a sweet word. The beautiful moon,
radiating pallid warmth to its admirers
below in the city, catalyzes all three genera-
tions in the family into sharing their feel-
ings with each other with complete hon-
esty. Under the moon, howling with his
dogs, the grandfather determines to stand
up to his son. Cosmo’s wife, Loretta’s
mother, finds the courage to confront her
husband. The brother and his wife, under
the influence of “Cosmo’s moon,” recap-
ture the love that has waned through their
long years together. Thus the family is
celebrated.

- With what an eye does the audience see

New York! Every scene shows the people
and the city in its sublimity, from the open-
ing in the funeral parlor to the close in the
sweep through the Castarini household
memorabilia. For New York does have a
unique beauty, rather rough-hewn in
places, but beautiful nonetheless. The
people express the same beauty. Though
rather vulgar and mean, they can nonethe-
less express friendship and affection with
their own paranoid charm. What makes this
movie special lies in its credibility. Noth-

_-ing seems fake about the:scenery, ori the

people. Allthe actors play their parts to per-
fection.

Naturally, Moonstruck will not appeal to
everybody. Why, I thought the batteries in
my HPS meter had died, the reading was so
low. And unless you’ve fallen in love
before, or have seriously considered doing
it in the near future, you may not chance
upon much to your liking in this film.

For the rest of us, although probably not
a big Oscar winner, Moonstruck is worth
the trouble to watch. Be sure to take some-
body special to the “feel-good” movie of
1988. :
