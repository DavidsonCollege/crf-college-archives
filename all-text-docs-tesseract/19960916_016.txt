Kruse’s Cubby
Pigskin
revival

By MICHAEL Kruse
Sports Editor

Yes, we do have a football
team.

Granted, it has been hiber-
nating for a few decades, but this
year it is rolling out of bed, rub-
bing its sleepy eyes, and rising
from the virtual dead.

Now, at 1-0, Iam not saying
that they are headed to a national
championship.

But they are talented enough
and spirited enough to make a
legitimate run at a winning sea-
son, which is, based on the woe-
ful history of football at
Davidson, akin to winning the
national title.

This team is good. And at
this juncture in Coach Landis’
rebuilding scheme, good is right
dandy. Great waits a tad down
the road.

So we have a capable foot-
ball squad. What now? I’ll tell
you what now.

At Maryville this weekend,
the crowd was relatively large,
rambunctious, noisy, and at times
even obnoxious.

And they actually cared.

As Davidson clearly estab-
lished and maintained the upper
hand, disgruntled Scots fanatics
began to play armchair
quaterback.

They yelled play calls at the
coaching staff, screamed at the
offensive line to get their heads
out of where the sun don’t shine,
and even offered some not-so-
friendly instructions to the Scots’
.| Division III All-American line-
backer.

The refs received death
threats.

One especially precocious
mom sitting in the back row be-
low the press box turned around
when her Maryville meatball son
recovered a fumble, looked bra-
zenly at the three Wildcat coaches
standing there, struck a sassy
pose, and pointed to a pin at-
tached to her bosom showing him.

She was like 60. And she
was talking smack.

Tiny little Maryville against
tiny little Davidson. And to these
people, it was Florida-Tennes-
see.

You know why?

Because Maryville is their
team.

And Davidson is our team.
And we should act like it, be-
cause this year there is no excuse.

Now I understand that the
kind of people who actually read
the Cubby on a weekly basis are
the kind of people who will prob-
ably show upatthe football games
anyway.

So it’s up to you, my loyal
readership. Spread the word: the
Wildcats make their Richardson
Field debut on Sept. 28 against
Emory & Henry, the 1 2th-ranked
Division III team in the country,
It is Homecoming.

And we’ ve all got some work
to do.

Football hits winning note —

Maryville, Tenn. - Tradition
has the Davidson football team
sing the fight song after every win.

After the Wildcats ended a
nine-game winless spell with a 24-
14 victory over Maryville (0-2) on
Saturday, all 56 players were ready
and willing to test their somewhat
rusty voices and belt out O
Davidson.

But the song was only icing
on the cake for Davidson (1-0), as
it had the Scots singing the blues
for most of the afternoon.

The much-improved Wildcats
shocked the feisty Maryville crowd
by dominating the first half on
their way to a 10-0 advantage at
intermission, and then rejected the
Scots’ spirited comeback bid in
the second to hold on to the confi-

.dence-building victory.

“Coach (Tim) Landis was talk-
ing before the game about how he
wanted this to be a new era in
Davidson football and to erase the
losing traditions that we’ ve had in
the past,” said co-captain line-

backer A.R. Barrington. “And this
was a huge, huge step.”

That it was, as the Wildcats
posted nonpareil efforts on both
sides of the ball.

The offense, which averaged
260 total yards last season, amassed
220 in the first half alone and fin-
ished with 403, nearly doubling
(242) ‘95’s weekly rushing output
(125).

Much of that was thanks to
sophomore slasher Lorenzo Moll,
who picked up 138 yards on 25
carries, and tallied two touch-
downs, the last one coming with 4
minutes, 6 seconds left in the con-
test and sealing the deal.

But Moll was hardly a one-
man wrecking crew, as rookie full-
back Eric Ferguson rumbled for 56
yards.

“We rushed the ball real well
and that opened up the play-action
pass,” said Landis.

Signal-caller Tommy Dugan,
who put Davidson up, 7-0, with
3:08 left inthe first quarter on a 4-
yard touchdown scamper, con-
nected on 10 of 17 tosses for a
respectable 161 yards, including

bombs of 37 yards to Ben Brown
and 33 yards to flanker Mike
Harrington.

Not quite Florida’s Fun ‘n’
Gun, but a drastic betterment over
last fall’s often stagnant offense.

But the defense was equally
impressive, even ‘more so in the
first frame. Led by Jay Ariail, Ben
Spivey, Chris Hess, Wes Thornton,
and Barrington, the new Stunt 4-3
formation gave up just three first
downs and 29 rushing yards in the
first 30 minutes.

The corps forced five turn-
overs, which led to 10 decisive
Wildcat points.

“T think defensively, they’re a
lot better this year than last year,”
said Maryville head coach Phil
Wilks. “They made the big plays.

We gave up the big plays. We
turned the ball over. Davidson’s
got a good, well-coached football
team.”

“T’ve never seen it so hyped
on the sideline,” said safety Max
Nelson amid a sea of postgame
smiles, “It was uribelievable -
people were bouncing around,
jumping around, going nuts. That’s
what it’s all about. A lot of our
momentum was kept up by the
sideline spirit.”

“Tt was a good team effort,”
said Harrington, who hauled in
three catches for a team-high 71
yards. “We deserve it. Every
single one of us.” _

And that fight song, it’s adamn
catchy tune.
