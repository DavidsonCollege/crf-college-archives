and for the two top Wildcat
swimmers.

Coach Tom Steven's squad,
which is 4-3 so far, will face

two tough opponents in the next
week, while a couple of Stev-
cus’ charges will be attempting
o set some school records.

Sophomore Jack Hobbs and
lreshman Rusty Saylor are both
within striking distance of col-
lege records in their respective
events,

Hobbs is close to two marks.

the outstanding depth on_ this
vear's squad,

“I've felt that Joe and Eric
can score 20 anytime, and we
have cight guys who can go out
aud hit double figures, so that
takes up the slack,” he com-
mented.

He added that he doesn't
think that his replacement, T.
J. Pecorak, feels much pres-
sure now as a starter. “T. J.
has been playing about 20 min-
ules a game anyway, so he is
used to the situations.”

Falconi pointed to Hunt and
Simpson as the men to stop
against Furman, adding that
“we'll want to beat them  be-
cause they beat us here, and
hot too many people do that.”

The major factors for the
Wildeats’ suecess appear to be
coach Terry Holland's increas-
ed skill at substituting for. tir-
ng players, and better use of
‘’ultiple defenses.

The full-court pressure allows
the team speed to become more
effective, resulting im increased
opponents’ turnovers.

As Falconi remarked, the
sophomores seem to be playing
\ i h more confidence now, and
this is a good sign as the con-
lerence play thickens.

So, after the contest with The
Citadel, it’s om to the rematch
with Furman. John Falconi will
be on the sidelines, but Joe Wil-

liams will be Shaking in his
boots,

exactly one second off the school
record.

In last Tuesday's meet against
Belmont Abbey, which the 'Cats
won 75-35, Hobbs came within
nine-tenths of a second of the
Davidson best in the 200-yard
individual medley. His time was
2:14.2,

Saylor, who swims in the 200-
yard breaststroke event, has
clocked a 2:33 this season. The
school record for his event is
2:31.

“Both boys can break those
records,” said Stevens, “‘they’ve
just got to work real hard for
it in the mext week or so.”

The two potential record-hold-
ers and their teammates will
have their work cut out for
them when they meet Appalach
ian State on Tuesday and Au-
gusta College on Friday.

The ’Cats have already lost to
Augusta College this year, and
the Appalachian squad beat Da-
vidson last year.

“The Augusta team beat Geor-
gia Tech this year, so they are
a lot tougher than we expect-
ed,” said Stevens.

“The Appalachian team beat
us last year, and as far as I
know they aren’t any worse than
they were last year, So both
meets will be very tough,” he
said.

One of Hobbs’ two defeats
this season came against the
Augusta backstroke swimmer, SO
the impetus for a new David-
son record is there.

“I keep getting closer and
closer to those records” said
Hobbs after his performance
against Belmont Abbey. “T think
1 can get them before the sea-
son’s over.”

Stevens pointed out that this
season may be Hobbs’ last
chance to set the records, since
the sophomore is considering
going abroad during his junior
year.

“But there have been records
broken every year that I’ve
been here, and even with the
small squad we have now, I
think we'll erase some of those
old names and times before the
season is over,” he said.

Stevens also mentioned two
other freshmen for their poten-
tial as swimmers.

“John Scholer and Peter Al-
ford should turn out to be real
good swimmers for us, said Ste-
yens,

“John is a real hard worker
and a very coachable swimmer,
and his times have been improv-
ing a lot.

“T expected great things from
Peter, but he’s had trouble with
the flu) this season, and he
hasn't really done much. But he
will do real well if he ever gets
healthy,” said Stevens.

’Cat Runners Open
With VMI Relays

Davidson's indour track team
opens its season Monday as the
Wildcats take on VMI and Fur-
man in Lexington. Va.

Saturday, six of Coach Heath
Whittle’s thinclads will partici-
pate in the VMI Relays, one of
the most prestigious indoor
events in the South.

Spriater Tom Richardson, hur-
dler Ray Swettenburg, and a
distance medley relay team of
Mark Connors, Rick Mullem,
Howard Boyd and Ricky Bell
are the tracksters who will run
in the relays.

Richardsa, who placed in the
60-yard dash in last year’s re-
lays. and Swetenburg, fourth in
the 70-yard high hurdles, both
loom as strong threats this year.

The freshiman-dominated dis
tance medley quartet will have
its work cut ott for it against
the likes of Tennessee, William
& Mary, Georgia Tech, West
Virginia, Duke and North Caro-
lina.

In Meanday’s meet, Whittle ex-
pects to have a full squad of 18
set to compete.

Richardson will run the 60-
and 220-vard dashes and legs

on the 440- and mile relay teams.

Swetenburg will participate in
the hurdles, 440 relay. high jump
and triple jump.

Other Wildcats who should do
well include Steve Shankweiler
in the shot, Bell in the mile, and
freshmen Connors and Dave Pa-
co in the 440.

Furman looms as the favorite
in the tri-meet as the peren-
nially-strong Paladins figure to
clean up in the distance events.

VMI and Davidson should
wage a close fight for second.
The Keydets have a_ well-bal-
anced team, but do not have as
many outstanding individuals as
the Wildcats.

The addition of a strong crop
of freshmen this year adds
depth and talent to the Whittle-
men, who are expecting one of
their best seasons in recent
years.

After the meets this weekend
the thinclads will have only one
more indoor meet, the Southern
Conference at Lexington. They
open the outdoor season March
18.
