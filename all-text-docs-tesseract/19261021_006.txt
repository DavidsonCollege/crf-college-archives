NEW TENNIS COURT

The need for new tennis courts has long
been felt at Davidson and now for the first
time it seems as if that need will be satisfied.

According to the plans announced by Mr.
Hobart, who is in charge of the construction
work done on the campus, operations will

| soon begin for: the building of quite a few

{new courts. It is planned to build four courts

directly behind ‘Watts dormitory, and work
will begin on these late this fall or early
spring, so they may be used before the end
of this school year. However, a great many
more courts than these will be constructed.
There are to be two terraces of courts on
number 9 fairway on the college golf course.
Here there will be plenty of room for the
spectators to watch the matches. Work on
these terraced courts will begin in the spring
so they will be ready for next fall.

ond with 13 points.

For things electrical

Grey is the state’s leading drop-kicker, with |
four field goals to his credit. By this means |
he has won two games for the Wildcats, his
toe being the deciding factor in both the P. C. |
and State games.

The Y. M. C. A. has received a book called
‘in which 13 heroes
of college campuses of both English and |
American colleges are discussed and their |
acts of heroism given. The reason why this |
book should be especially interesting to men |
of Davidson is the fact that one of the heroes |
whose story is given is a Davidson man. His |

| story is as follows, briefly :

sia, in 1880, of parents who though originally |
Moslems, had embraced Christianity and re- |
mained true to their trust, even in view of |
the loss of social standing because of their |
adoption of this new religion.. So reared in
such an environment, David quite naturally |
wanted to learn more about his religion, and
decided to come to America to study. He
came over here and entered a preparatory |
school in Virginia and in the fall of 1896 en- |
tered Davidson. His course of study was |
made doubly hard because he had to study |
English as much and a whole lot more than |
most foreign languages of today. But in
spite of a handicap like that, he rapidly be-
came a leader on the campus and one whose
reputation, physical, mental and moral, was
of the highest type. He graduated in 1900
and decided to spend the summer in David-
son. He was invited to go on the annual
picnic of the College Church at Catawba

River, and during the day quite a few of the
party went in bathing. Yonan did not go in,
but while he stood and watched the swimmers,
he suddenly heard a cry for help coming
from a young man by the name of Fred
Hobbs, and despite the fact that he could not
swim, he nevertheless plunged into deep water
in a vain atempt to save his fellow student.
He sank immediately and before rescuers
could get him he drowned.”

The author gives this noble and unselfish |
deed proper recognition and heads this story |
under the captian, “Greater love hath no man
than this, that he lay down his life’ for a
friend.” Surely we can derive great benefit
from this heroic account and great pride that
Davidson produced a man, of such wars as
this. ’ nie

Don't fail to go by the “Y” room and read
these stirring stories, and above all, the one
which tells of a true Davidson MAN.
