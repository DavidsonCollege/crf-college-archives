call was accepted and he served this

work in Augusta covers the exciting and
tragic period of the Civil War and the
hardly less trying years immediately fol-

sons identified themselves with the
cause of the Confederacy and it was in
Dr. Wilson’s church that the Southern
Assembly was organized in 1860. He

himself was elected stated clerk of this y pats

bedy in 1865 and filled the office for
nearly forty years, the length of his
period of service being in itself a proof
of the ability and efficiency with which
he performed the duties involved.

Dr. Wilson’s pastorate in Augusta
was marked by an ever increasing popu-
larity, influence, and power as a preach-
er, presbyter, man of letters and citizen
of distinction. His home was a center
of culture and refinement and here were
often entertained the most prominent
figures in the pulpits, seminary profes-

sorships, and councils of the Southern,

Assembly; not to speak of other guests
of high standing in state and church.

avery graphic and engaging, and at
times diverting picture of the life of the
Wilsons in Augusta. The several social
strata to which the pastor must tact-
fully accomodate his life, the handsome
church building, with its stately elms)
without and its quiet family pews and|
carpeted aisles within, the stalwart Cal-|
vinist Dr, Wilson with his strict Sabbath |
views and practices, his imperative and |
compelling family altar, his fear and |
dread lest his children—Woodrow among
them—might not prove to be of the)
elect, and his steady and unceasing ef-|
fort to train the boy into a life that by |
its uprightness and correctness would |
make it clear that he was among the
chosen, and further still this preacher's
home, the gathering place of the great
men of the new Southern Assembly, Dr.
James Woodrow, the noted scientist, his
brother-in-law, Dr. Thornwell, Dr. B.
M. Palmer, Dr. Adger, Dr. Moses Hoge
and others, are’ all features of the pic-
ture that Dr. Dodd’s facile and vigorous
[Pen presents.

Dr. Wilson was called to Columbia
Theologicat Seminary in 1870 to fill the
chair of pastoral and evangelistic the-
ology, a work for which he was admir-
ably fitted by natural gifts, personal
aptitudes and tastes and by general
scholastic attainments. He, however, re-
mained at Columbia for only four years, |
accepting a call to the First Church, Wil-
mington, N. C. This was his last pas-
torate but not his last work. After
laboring in Wilmington for quite a
period of years, he accepted an appoint-
ment to the chair of theology in the
Southwestern Presbyterian University,
at Clarksville, Tenn., and taught in this
institution until increasing infirmity of
years compelled his resignation.

In the early ’90’s Dr. Wilson went to
Princeton to live with his son, Woodrow
Wilson, who had recently been elected
to the chair of jurisprudence and poli-
tics in Princeton College. Here he died
in the eighty-first-year his his age.

His body was laid to rest in the Pres-
byterian churchyard of Columbia, by
that of his wife, whose death had oc-
curred some years earlier,

Dr. Wilson was very generally rec-
ognized as one of the brilliant and
scholarly preachers of his day. The
writer has been told by his father, Rey.
Dr. E. H. Harding, who knew Dr. Wil-
son rather intimately-and loved him for
his many fine qualities, that gifts of
heart and of mind, courtliness of man-
ner and beauty of speech, all united to
make his personality attractive
pleasing in high degree.

Dr. Harding was under his instruction
when Dr. Wilson was teaching math-
ematics at Hampden Sidney and he
states that Dr. Wilson’s profundity of
knowledge was past his fathoming as a
student. He says that one of the de-
lights of his college days was hearing
Dr. Wilson preach from time to time.
His fine presence, handsome face, dainty,
beautiful rhetoric and nice phrasing
were most engaging and winsome. The
young student thought and continued to
think when he heard him in later years
that it might be said of Joseph Wilson
as Dr. Johnson said of Goldsmith—

enlarged, enriched, but with the same
philosophical, political, religious and the-
ological horizon. This is the place to}
say that Scotch Theology and life do
not have that narrow and illiberal puri-
tanical excommunication of all good}
worldly things which marked the ex- |
treme type of iconoclastic British Puri- |
tanism. To illustrate, John Knox ap-|
preciated the claims of beauty, money, |
social position, and, when at the age of
fifty he got ready to marry a second)
time, he selected a rare and beautiful |
and youthful heiress—cousin to Mary, |
Queen of Scots; and she brought him |
youth, beauty, money, social standing ; |
and mutual love crowned their union as |
long as life lasted.’ Beauty, grace, the}
wise use of all earthly good gifts:as well |
as science and truth reign at the col- |
leges of Davidson and Princeton as well |
as at the University of St. Andrews and |
Edinburgh—and the influences of David-
son and Princeton were in absolute har- |
mony with his Scotch heredity and the}
teachings of his father’s study. and}

He studied law for two years at that |
famous seat of culture and catholicity, |
the University of Virginia, and if any-|}
thing were needed to give breadth and |
amplitude of horizon to the discipline, |
which had been somewhat dense
tional-and largely ecclesiastical Jeffer-'
son’s famous foundation gave the ad-
ditional scope and range of view. |

Then followed several years of spe-|
cialization in the study of the philosophy |
of Society and the State at Johns Hop-
kins, under the tuition of the famous}
teachers which the gifted Gilman had}
gathered there.

But his character had received its set :|
his intellectual and cultural tastes had}
been fixed, when he went for profes-|
sional and post-graduate study to the |
renowned schools at Charlottesville and |
Zaltimore; and there is a singular and |
inner affinity between the heredity |
which on so many occasions he has most |
gratefully acknowledged, and his train- |
ing and education which in most respects |
was almost identical with that which |
his Scotch forbears had received at St.|
Andrews or Glasgow or Edinburgh.)
Davidson and Princeton are modelled |
after St. Andrews, the oldest of the|
Scotch universities. His heredity and|
education were not antagonistic, but co- |
partners well-mated and lovingly |
matched. |

sen,’ and the same evening he made a|
‘select speech’ and was fined 20 cents
for ‘improper conduct in the hall’ Other
fines recorded aré: 10 cents for sitting
on the rostrum, 10 cents for failure to
return a book on time, and 10 cents for
talking. On April 25, Mr. T. Wilson was
appointed ‘to inscribe’ the names of our
alumni in a book to be purchased for
this purpose,’ and for this work he was
given a vote of thanks. This fact and
a later entry gives evidence of his stand-
ing as a scribe.

the noon-time luncheon. At 5:00 p. m.|
he and Mrs. Wilson motored up to the!
college. A large part of the faculty and|
student body had gone to Charlotte to|
hear his address, but in some unknown)
way the news of his plan reached ‘the |
surrounding country and the campus was |
fairly well filled with those who had}
been unable.to go to the celebration. |
Mr. Wilson’s hope to see the campus in|
its normal, school-life condition was foil-|
ed, but he did visit his old room and the!
spot where he had strengthened his |
muscles in cutting wood and the Eu-
menean Society hall where he stated}
that he made his ‘first attempt to speak |
aid failed’ By this withdrawal of his|
party from the throngs in Charlotte and |
in other ways during his presidency Mr.
Wilson has shown an abiding interest in
the college where one year of his youth
was spent.

“One of his classmates wrote in 1918:|
‘He did not have the reputation of being|
unusually brilliant in his classroom work,
but he was an all-round man and recog-
nized as a leader in college life, and a|
specialist in current politics.” |
