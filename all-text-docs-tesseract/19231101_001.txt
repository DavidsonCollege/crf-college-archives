His steadiness also prevailed in the third

Dramatic Club Presents

Three One-Act Plays

Plays by Galloway aad Elkins and a
Musical Fantasy to be Presented

The Dramatic Club will present three one
act plays during the week of Thanksgiving.
Following out the policy of the club, all of

the program will consist of original play:
written by members of the Dramatic organi
zation,

The first is a cynical tragi-comedy writ-
ten by L. D. Elkins, the title of which is
“Out 0° Goodness.” The next is a tragedy,
entitled “The Cretin,” written by W. BE,
Galloway. This is a psychological play

which shows the
periments on

results of a scientist's ex-
a half-wit. It tells a gripping
story and will fequire powerful acting.

The third musical entitled
“Why, Pierrot.” The book and lyrics were
written by Prof. E. J. Erwin. The
is the joint product of J. R. Earnest,
Jones, John Bryan, W. W. Purdy,
zer Hood, Mrs. W. L. Porter, and Mrs. A.
M. Ingold of Morganton. The Glee Club
has been practicing some of the songs, and

Some striking scenic, lighting, and costume
effects are being planned for this production.

Try-outs for the various parts have al-
ready been -held.
