Two American Negroes!

Dr. Samuel Spencer '40, president of Mary Baldwin Col-
lege and former Dean of Students at Davidson, spoke in
chapel Monday for the spring tapping ceremonies of Omicron
Delta Kappa. Nine students and one faculty member were
elected to membership in this national leadership fraternity.

Those tapped at the ceremony were Dr. Earl MacCor-
mac; seniors Dave Olin, Tom Loflin, Skip Jones, Wayne
Smithers, and Grier Stephenson; and juniors John Barrow,
David Walker, Rick von Unwerth, and Ronnie Reese.

In his address Spencer emphasized the importance of in-
telligent campus criticism. Relating his views on criticism
to those on leadership, he stated, ‘‘The really effective campus
leader must also be campus critic.”

He continued by delineating some of the problems encoun-
tered by critics and offering them a knowing and understand-
ing sympathy: “The campus critic knows that while his
criticism may influence social change, he will not be called
upon to direct or control it.’ Spencer also stressed the im-
portance of scholarship in ODK. He said that the basic initial
requirement for membership is ‘‘a recognition by ODK, ..
that intellectual pursuits are, after all, the purpose for which

a student should be in college.”

Joe Howell, president of ODK, conducted the tapping

ceremonies. He outlined the criteria for election to ODK and
stated that many deserving students were ineligible because
of ODK's scholastic requirements. A student must be in the

upper 35 per cent of his class.

Mac¢Cormac, assistant professor of Bible and philosophy,
earned his BA, MA, BD and PhD from Yale.

Monday morning, Kilpatrick
spoke of the 300 years of sec-
ond-class citizenship for -the
American Negro as ‘‘but a tick
in the clock of eternity.” De-
spite the perhaps unfortunate
choice of words, this phrase set
the tone of the coffee hour that
followed. (See editorial on page
two.)

Resting on the Constitution
and on the body of English Com-
mon Law, Kilpatrick _ stated,

JAMES KILPATRICK
300 years is but a tick...“

“There is no such thing as a
social necessity under law —
only an economic _ necessity.
Until it can be shown that dis-
crimination interferes with com-
merce among the states, Con-
gress should have to seek a
new basis for civil rights legis-
lation.”

With such a distinction made
between economic and social
necessity, the campus visitor
felt that public monopolies (ie.,
utilities and retailers of basic
needs in isolated areas) had no
basis for discrimination.

But on the other hand, private
entrepreneurs have the right to
discriminate. ‘The fifteenth
amendment gave them (Negro
race) the vote, but it does not
give them the right to a hot dog
or typewriter I might be selling.

“fA => Contitutional = amend-
ment,’’ said Kitpatrick,”’ Is the
only way to legislate civil
rights action.” He went on to
say that he felt this way be-
fore the Supreme Court re-
versed ifs stand on school in-
tegration in Brown v. Topeka

Boord of Education. ‘There.

should be a distinction be-

tween a court decision and an
amendment; such has not al-
ways been apparent.”

Questioned further about the
sociological evidence presented

BY BOB STRAUSER

in the Brown case to the effect
that discrimination is damaging
to mental health, Kilpatrick
said that he would accept and
recognize that this is the begin-
ning of a body of law.

In the afternoon, he would go
on to say that, for various his-
torical reasons the Negro race
was inferior to the Caucasian
race,

What about the Negro’s right
to demonstrate? Said Kilpat-
rick, “I publicly supported
peaceful demonstrations in Dan-
ville, Va. But physical inter-

: ference with commerce is not

the same thing: this is license,
not liberty: As a businessman,
I have a right to discriminate:
I can dispose of my property
as I see fit. subject to estab-
lished limitations. I cannot use
my property to be harmful to
my neighbors.”

On the civil rights bill before
the Senate, Kilpatrick had de-
finite opinions. He objected
strongly to the literacy test of
Title I.

While pointing out that the
15th amendment prohibits a
racial qualification for voting,
the editor maintained the fed-
eral government has no right to
either prescribe or ban literacy
tests for voting if administered
impartially.

Kilpatrick favors the pro-
posed Monroney amendment
to the Senate bill. This amend-
ment would make discrimina-
tion illegal for establishments

o Discriminate’

on interstates, primary high-
ways, and among chain opera-
tions with outlets in different
states. “This is merely the
old inn keeper’s law in mod-

ern form,” sald Kilpatrick,

“and 1 do not object fo it.”

The visiting editor dismissed
completely two arguments pre-
sented in the coffee hour.
Charlie Ramberg asked, ‘Since
government institutions protect
all establishments, how can any
establishment legally discrimin-
ate against a citizen?” .

Kilpatrick dismissed this as
a dangerous line of reasoning
originally introduced by Justice
Douglas. He replied, ‘Just be-
cause the police and fire de-
partments protect my home.
does that mean my home is
open to anyone?"

Another argued that discrim-
ination is a conspiracy in re-
straint of trade. Not so, said
Kilpatrick, and he repeated his
views on private property.

Early in the discussion, the
Richmond editor noted that

‘there could well be a damaging

backlash from demonstrations.
“The Senate might rebel if it
gets worse.”

At dinner Monday night he
noted the failure of the “‘stall
in’ demonstration in New York
City. “Too bad we didn't have
a blood bath up there,’ mourn-
ed. a student. Said Kilpatrick,
facetiously, ‘Yes, it might have
gotten us ten more yotes in the
Senate.”

Student Council Sets May ll

For the purpose of issuing the
annual. charters to each campus
organization, the council has
distributed applications for

Three Boys Admitted,
But Only Two Accept

Two American, Negro students have been accepted
and have indicated that they definitely plan to enroll as
members of the freshman class next fall, the Admissions

Office announced today.

They are Leslie Brown of
Trenton. N. C. and. Wayne
Crumwell of Chesapeake, Va.
A third Negro who was accept-
ed at Davidson chose another
school. They were selected from
among 11 Negro applicants who
filed for admission to the Col-
lege, one of whom has _ been
placed on the admissions wait-
ing list.

Brown is valedictorian of
his class of 82 students at
Jones High School in Trenton.
He is president of the Stud-
ent Council, president of the
National Honor Society; co-
editor of the yearbook, and a
member of the Debate Team.
Crumwell is in the top five

per cent of his class of 203 at
Crestwood Senior High School
in Chesapeake. Active in dra-
matics for the last two years,
he also serves as president of
the Debate Club.

‘He is president of the Nation-
al Honor Society and was run-
ner-up for president of the
student body.

In February of 1961. the Col-
lege Trustees took the first
step toward integration by ap-
proving the admission of a Con-
golese boy to the student body.

The most important announce-
ment concerning the integra-
tion of the Cellege came from
the spring meeting of the
trustees in 1962. At this time
the trustees approved by a
large majority a policy open-
ing the college to students re-
gardless of race or nationality.

in September of 1962, the

first Negro student—a Con-
golese—enrolied as a fresh-
man at Davidson. He was
joined last fall by another
student from the Congo.

school achievements, and they
are expected to enroll at Dav
idson next fall.

‘Their admission to Davidson
is in keeping with the decision
of the Davidson trustees that
Davidson's doors are open to all
qualified students without re-
gard to race,"’ he continued.

Said Associate Director of Ad-
missions H. Edmunds Wiiite,
“We think we're going to have
a fine freshman class __ next
year, and these two boys will
be good additions to the class.”

Former Student Body Presi-
dent John Spratt added, “This
will be a terrific chaltenge
for Davidson boys who pro-

fess bellefs in integration to
act out their convictions.”

“I hope there will not be a
de facto segration within
the student body against these
young men and that they will
become full members of the
student body in every sense of
the word; intellectually, politi-
cally, and socially."

Costs Are Set For College Union Renovation

BY BUCK LAWRIMORE

A quarter of a million
dollars will go toward ex-
pansion and operation of
the Davidson College Stud-
ent Union during 1964-45,
including Phase 2 of Union
renovation.

Speaking for the administra-
tion, Business Manager Robert
A. Currie said that he antici-
pates- some $50,000 will be ap-
proved for operation of the
Union, over $5,000 of which will
be administered by the Union
Board of college students.

Currie anticipates that $200,
000 will be needed for Phase 2
of the renovation project now
underway.

Phase 1. now virtually com-
pleted, included addition of the
new wing of the Union and fur-
nishing it. Phase 2 will involve
remodeling extensively the ori-
ginal downstairs area of the
building, and air-conditioning
the entire building.

Last year the budget was ap-
proximately $48.000 plus some
$124,000 for Phase 1. Currie
said that he expects only $2,000
of the requested $5,000 increase
will be approved for the regular
budget. The $76.000 increase for
Phase 2 will be handled sep-
arately.

“With the tremendous up-
surge of student requests for
our cooperation and with more
money and assistance, we hope

to build a successful and a hap-
py Union program next year."
said C. Shaw Smith, director of
the Union. '‘We don't want stud-
ents all to feel that every time
they want to have a good time
they have to leave campus.”

The majority of this ‘‘success
and happiness’’ depends on the
Program Expense Budget
supervised by the Union Board,
which has asked for $7,000 for
their part of the over-all bud-
get, an increase of $2,000 over
the present year.

“I'm afraid that they won't
get nearly as much an increase
as they have asked,” Currie
said. ‘‘For one thing, the pres-
ent $5,000 represents a substan-
tial increase over previous
years, For another thing, it has
been stated that the main use
of this additional money would
be for increased social activi-
ties, and we haven't. seen much
positive indication that the stud-
ent body as a whole really
wants a sizeable expansion in
dances, parties, and that sort
of thing at the Union.”

Smith also asked for $3.000
more mainly for equipment, but
Currie said that because of a
lack of funds the amount ap-
proved will be significantly
less than that, although when
the whole budget has been taken
care of there may be a chance
of left-over funds going toward
that equipment.

At any rate, the $200,000 for
expansion will itself effect
many changes in the Union 1t-
self. In addition to air-condi-
tioning the. whole Union Build-
ing. the dining area will be
radically changed.

The serving counter for the
cafeteria and the snack bar will
be switched so that it will be
possible to close off the dining
room—what Smith insists will
become a ‘dining hall''—for
cleaning and perhaps late sup-
pers for special groups.

The new arrangement — will
permit the snack bar to be open
at the same time as the cafeter-
ia during second semester or
when visitors are on campus
for special occasions.

The renovation will also in-
clude an extra five dining
rooms, all adequately lighted
with a decor suitable to lunch.
eon meetings and the like. One
of the rooms will be a Presiden
tial Room for very special oc-
casions, Smith said, but avail-
able for rental by students.

The other rooms will be so
constructed that any number of
them may be joined together
for large occasions, so that
over 100 people may be dining

there at the same time, either!

in separate rooms or in com-
binations of rooms,

The dining hall itself will be
completely redecorated.

Smith also intends that a full-

time man be employed next
year to supervice the operation
of the whole new wing of the
Union, who will be especially
needed since textbooks will al-
so be sold next year there, as
well as, Smith hopes, some
laboratory equipment and teach-
ing aids.

No Reading Period
To Precede Exams

There will be no reading day
prior to the 1964 spring semes-
ter exams as was erroneously
stated in THE DAVIDSON.
IAN article concerning the
decision to begin this practice.

Reading days have been
scheduled for both semesters
of the 1964-65 school year.

Exams for this year's sec-
ond semester will begin Wed-
nesday, May 20. and will con-
tinue through Thursday, May
28.

To be instituted next year
with the reading period is a
system whereby both Monday
and Tuesday classes will be
held on the same day once
each semester on. the day be-
fore the one-day reading per-
iod. Those days will be Mon-
day, Jan. 18, and Monday,
May 24, 1965.
