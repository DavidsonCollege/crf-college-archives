Beyond Birkenstock:
Yet another unsolicited dose of Neo-Fascist Drivel

Hey, did you read that jury
selection for the trial of General
Manuel (Pineapple-Face) Noriega
has begun in Miami! Of course
you didn’t! You were too busy
watching the Atlanta Braves and
Jimmy Connors. Well, it turns out
that questionnaires given to poten-
tial jurors revealed that more than
60% believed they should just hang
him. Our poll of the same people
disclosed thatnearly 90% believed
that Noriega should be released in
exchange for Ted Kennedy. Hey,
the Disciples couldn’t believe it
when the people asked for Barra-
bas either.

Speaking of Ted Kennedy, did
you notice that liberals all over the
country found something else to
be pissed off about. Wake up ye
who need a cause, it’s almost
Supreme Court Confirmation time
again!

In Washington a commercial
has been running that asks the
simple question “Who will judge
the Judge?_ Who indeed? Well,
three of the senators on the Senate
Confirmation Committee have less
than stellar track records. A couple
ofconservative groups took itupon
themselves to point out a few of
Teddy’s faults (one of those being

that little incident at Chappaquid-
dick), as well as Joe Biden’s petty
problems with doing original work
and, to top it all off they reminded
the public that Sen. Alan

righteous Teddy, once did leave
the scene of a fatal accident. Joe
Biden (former candidate for Presi-
dency) did admire Neil Kinnock

If you’ll turn “off” the selec-
tive memory switch and think back
to when someone named Robert
Bork was up for nomination to the

Supreme Court, a justi-

Cranston has been justa
little less than ethical at
times.

Ofcourse, these ads
have already been
deemed “inappropriate”
and “unprofessional.”
There go those damn
conservatives hitting
liberals below the belt
again with the truth; it’s
Jesse Helms style poli-
tics (for all of you unfa-
miliar with Helms’ his-
tory, Democrats resent
that he “pulls out all the
stops” and absolutely

fication for this conser-
vative action emerges.
If you will recall, as we
most certainly do, a
massive liberal assault
against Bork was
launched. A main
weapon in this assault
was TV ad campaigns
showing why certain
groups opposed Bork.
These ads were full of
exaggerations and half-
truths. Bork was hardly
the anti-Christ the ads
made him out to be.
However, this campaign

abhor the fact that they
can’t beat him!) all over again.
Well.

It looks like liberals every-
where have the unique ability to
flip the selective memory switch
to “on” whenever they want. Of
course thisisacheap political move
designed to undercut Democratic
strategy against Clarence Thomas
but, hey folks, at least we can be
happy that it’s the truth. Teddy,

On the Wonders of Campus
Construction and Cool Fresh Rules

To everything there is a sea-
son, etc. You‘ve heard it. Oldnews.

At the Davidson of Today we
cast the poo-pooers aside for this is
the season for everything. A Thor
has risen among us. Nail gun spar-
kling above his cushman mounted
minions, he rumbles: "Mow it and
we will build.“

(Chant with me please) Dorms,
parking lots, bricks, hay-hay.
Dorms, parking lots, bricks, hur-
ray! (chorus) BRING MORE
BRICKS I SEE.SOME GRASS!
(repeat).

I say, thank God! Grass stains
pants. It turns toes green, and
probably does nothing positive for
the cork of one's Birkenstocks.
Spiders grow there. Yuk! and grass
clippings make my mother‘s
cousin‘s best friend‘s uncle sneeze
like hell. And trees!. Trees dent
fenders, and where they grow one
simply cannot park.

Furthermore, the Physical
Plant has assured me that the oxy-
gen no longer being produced by

] all the green things rubbed out in
| the past two years will be more

than made up by the grass now
growing on what used to be the
track. Moreover, the kind man
informed me that anyone attempt-
ing to trench the track will have
hell to pay.

I ask the scoffers. Would you
not rather live in a furnished apart-
ment than a tent? I know I prefer
brick walkways to mud.

Our leaders today will fixit-
FixitFIxitFIXitFIXIT! And dothey
rest on the laurels of matériel suc-

cess? No! These liberal arts gradu-
ates recognize the value of a hu-
man soul, especially one belong-
ing to an Upperclassman. And
damned if they don‘t plan to fix
that, too.

Freshman are so STUPID!
They are idiots. Morals? Ha! They
wouldn‘t know their ethical butt
from their ankle. I meta freshman
once who .. . oh, never mind, but

have sent out the proverbial warn-
ing shot. Indeed, these same con-
servatives have said that they’ll
stop the ad campaign if People for
the American Way calls off its
planned multimillion dollar ad plan
to paint Thomas up in Bork’ scloth-
ing. However, if Ted Kennedy and
his drones intend to turn the these
nomination hearings into a circus
again, conservatives are willing to
start a sideshow of their own. Of
course all of this action is deplor-
able and totally unnecessary, but
try telling that to P. for the A. W.,
NOW and, for that matter, The
National Right to Life organiza-
tion.

The point is that the Supreme
Court and these confirmations are
not supposed to be political arenas.
This is the underlying lesson be-
hind the conservative ad campaign.
To bring up three senators shady
pasts that everyone, presumably,
already knows about is as inappro-
priate as deciding an a supreme
court nomination based on politi-
cal grounds. Let’s hope the slings
and arrows of outrageous adver-
tisements stop here, and that Judge
Thomas can be judged, as our fore-
fathers intended, on his qualifica-
tions alone.

believe me, he was dumb as R-O-
C-K-S (I don‘t want to offend any
of them you see). My goodness,
but they know nothing!

And for so long simply ig-
nored. We just let ’em run wild,
pestering Upper Classmen as they
pleased, breathing our air. We're
safe now, though. For one month
atleast, they can‘ttouchus. Maybe,
God knows I doubt it, but maybe,
by then, they‘ll at least use active
verbs.

Davidson has evolved somuch
since I arrived on campus four
years ago (yes, four years. I‘m
taking my sweet time). The place
was such a simple town then.
Nauseating. Easy going, vacuous.
Food Lion was justacross the street
next to Cornwell Drugs. People
needed never leave the little burg.
Just buy food, drink tap water, and
slowly rot away.

And the children, Oh! the chil-
dren, They swarmed like mad
lemmings with nary aspeeding car
come by to prune the screaming
weeds.

And I confess; when I was a
freshman, I tormented my elders.
Upper Class hand, won‘t you guide
me. Wise hand, lead me. Oh hand,
hand, are youtwenty-one? Ishould
have been shot. Thank you, Lead-
ers, for squirreling such infantil-
ism away.

I can only ask, if I may, that
more bedone. Unfathomably, some
freshmen tur into Seniors, and
some of them into people. I fear for
the moral future of our nation. We
