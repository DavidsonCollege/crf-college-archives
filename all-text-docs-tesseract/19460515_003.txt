Hounded until they could resist
no bonger, eleven illustrious David-
son students and one office seeker
answered the question for the week,
“What feature in the DAVIDSON-
IAN do you like best and why?
in the following manners.

Amos Regan—' Letters to the Edi-
tors because it gives the students a
chance to voice their opinions.”
Forsly—"The particular
feature of the DAVIDSONIAN
which I like best is the ‘Letters to
the Editors’ column, Because in that
column, an individual has the op-
portunity to give critisms on policy
regarding

faculties available which are not
being used to their fullest.”
Tommy Little — “Letters to the

Editors because it hands out orc-
hids and onions without favoritism
or predjudice; offering constructive
critisms which, when followed up,

and wellbeing of the student body.”

Unidentified office seeker—‘Cat

“Whiskey” Swink is found lead-

is of the impression that the Operat-

comment at a bull session and con-
‘tains news which is news to most

In The Night

By WALTER BOYD

The Soft celestial cloud enfolds me
in,

And light clopes to Hell below my
sin,

The stars accoust the heavens near
to me;

The darkness shréud-like hides the
world from me,

The black eyed monster slowly
stalks my plight:

'Tis in the night, ‘Tis in the night.

The glowing maiden stirred by mat-
ing zest,

And leans her head on shoulder’s as
to rest,

Is layed beneath the stars in sin to
breed,

\ child, a wander, for the world to
feed

And more of evil lust than I may
write,

‘Tis it

‘Tis in the night, the night.

The flask Hes hidden iy the cul-
prit’s vest,

To spoil and wait the night to
quench his zest,

And brought forth when the dark-
ness hides his glee,

And sins, carousing on his night-
long spree,

The sin of spirits visioned but by
night,

Tis in the night, ‘Tis in the night.

As evil creepeth round about the
earth,

And men commit their;crime on hid-
den turf,

To God in earnest we do throw our
plea,

And His reply doth shake-the earth
and sta,

For ages men hath prayed while in
the light,

3ut in the night, 'Tis in the night.
