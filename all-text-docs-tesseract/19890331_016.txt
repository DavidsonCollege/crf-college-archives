PRESIDENT, from page 15

student body on the condom question, the
Senate has voted to hold a referendum on
Tuesday, April 4 in conjunction with elec-
_tions.for class senators. Students can vote
in the referendum on the first floor of
Chambers in front of the Gallery or in the
Conversation Pit of the College Union.
Polls will be open from 9:00 to 3:00. :
' The referendum wascarefully worded by
representatives from the Human Resources
Committee, the Student Health Options
and Concerns Committee, the Union and
the Senate. It reads, “Should Davidson
College provide direct access to condoms
for Davidson students? (Yes or No).”
We did not specify the means of access,
because that would cloud the issue. Some
students are for the availability of con-

- doms, but against machines or first. ‘aid

boxes or one of the other choices. If the
“Yes” votes win, then representatives from
the SGA, HRC, SHOC, Union, and other

members of the student body will meet to .

discuss the options and choose one that

most students on campus will be comfort-.

able with.
The success and the validity of this effort

depends on your involvement. The Senate
urges you to vote in the referendum on

Tuesday so that true student opinion will be
represented in the results. We want to know
what you think about this controversial
question; please contact me, Tim Sparks,
vice president, or your SGA senator if you
have any comments or suggestions, _

Remember to vote on Tuesday, npr 4!

Tripp Helms
SGA President

CONDOMS, from page 15

would definitely affect them. “I’d wonder
about the type of students that went to
Davidson,” one said. Another was unable
to put her exact feelings into words, but
stated that the sight would undoubtedly
make an impact on her.

Those who criticized Boyd Miller and
Paul Renner’s commentaries may have
been able to find some fault with their
statistics, but it was impossible for these
writers to deny the moral impact the con-
dom machines will have on the Davidson

campus. Just because students “choose to”
_ sin” by engaging in sexual relations outside
of marriage, the college is not obligated to

help them “sin safely.” The opposition to

_the machines is not merely “inveterate

Bible-pounding pontification,” but adher-
ence to God’s own laws which Davidson

College supposedly still champions and
claims to follow.

Sincerely,
Debbie deSola

ADMISSIONS, from page 15

unsubstantiated data are not very construc-
tive. The problems we face are not due to —
a lack of commitment, and they are not
going to be solved by pointing fingers. The

‘recruitment/enroliment of minorities in

higher education is a national disgrace, and
those of us responsible for this function at
Davidson welcome the efforts of anyone —
who would like to pitch in and make things

better.

Sincerely;
Robert E. Gardner
