A Man For All Seasons

When Lefty Driesell’s basketball camp closed down
last month, Ton Youngdale said goodbye to Davidson
basketball. He also put the lid on four .2ars of exper-
iences that could fill a book.

Most of the Davidson fans in Charlotte remember

Tom by different names or different means. He has
been called “Tiger Tom,” “Tom Turkey, “Dale or
simply “that real tall guy who used to start.
* “Tom's height ranged between 6-10 and 6-11 de-
pending on who was writing the programs. His classic
answer to the question most often asked, “how tall are
you?”", was a simple “well, how small are you?”

Tom certainly was not the best basketball player
who ever put on a Davidson uniform, but he may have
been the most unusual. Who can forget watching Tom
lead a fast break down the court with everyone in the
Coliseum holding his breath, players and coaches in-
cluded. And then who can forget watching him throw
in a 30-foot running hook one time and the next time
down the court dropkick the ball into the balcony?

Tom found himself in an entirely new position last
year. He was on the bench. At first this bothered him
but like most players who sit, he settled into a world
of complacency and dreams. ;

During one game, he turned to me and said, “You
know, this bench isn’t that bad.” Maybe the cheer-
leaders who had just finished jumping up and down
in front of the chairs had something to do with his
decision.

As his teammate, I sat next to Tom on the bench
more than anyone else. Through this experience I
probably got to know him, if anyone ever did.

Tom never liked rules that were designed to make
everyone alike. When.he came to school as a sopho-
more, he decided that he was tired of living in the
college dorm and wanted to get a place off-campus.
At that time, the only way for an underclassman to
accomplish this task is to get married or get thrown
out of the dorms for some infraction. Tom chose the
latter. .

He and his roommate threw their beds and most
of the furniture in their room out of a second story
window. After this was done, Tom knocked the door
off the hinges with a forearm blow that any football
coach would admire. Needless to say the next day Tom
and his roomie were off-campus after they paid for
the damage.

Last December’s Sugar Bowl Classic basketball
tournament in New Orleans presented Tom with an-
other chance “to get out of the dorm.” The Davidson
team was staying in a large hotel about 10 blocks from
Bourbon Street, but as for getting out and seeing the
sights on our own we might as well have been 10 miles
away.

Tom never let things like this bother him. After
an hour or two of reconnoitering the hotel, he found
an escape route free of coaches. On the floor above us,
there existed an old laundry elevator which went
directly to the first floor. From there, a quick dash
out a fire escape would lead to the street which ran
in back of the building. ; ;

Deciding that he would probably be noticed if he
left by the front door, Tom took the back route. He
made good his escape along with another player and
they walked to the French Quarters. Tom thought that
he and this other player would just “blend in with the
crowd” on Bourbon Street. Unfortunately this never
worked out for it seems that two baskteball players,
6-11 and 6-8 respectively, have a hard time blending
into anything. ‘

When Tom came to Davidson his sophomore year,
he drove back a '56 blue Chevy from his home in Peru,
Ml, He planned to purchase a new car later on in the
year. As it turned out the Chevy. was the newest car
Tom ever owned at school.

It was March of the next year when some drunk
ran into the back of Tom’s Machine as it sat in front
of his home. Immediately afterwards Tom searched
for some form of Transportation and came up with a
°45 Harley-Davidson Motorcycle that. looked like a
tractor from the rear. It was the old type with the
stick gear shift on the left.

Later on Tom found an old World War I flier’s
leather helmet with ear flaps and goggles. Along with
a white scarf, leather jacket and a pair of sand boots,
Tom would ride his “hog” around the streets of David-
son looking like something out of the movies.

Tom also bought a '51 grey Nash for $50. You
remember the type. The ones that looked like a bath-
tub with wheels. Every day it seemed that the students
and people of Davidson would be treated with the sight
of Tom, all 6-11 of him, hanging out on all sides while
riding his cycie, or crouched over the back of a bumper,
pushing his Nash. °

At the present, rumor has it that Tom is traveling
in this country looking for adventure. He is also sup-
posed to return to Charlotte in the near future. The
last word anyone heard was that he was working as a
bouncer in a bar in Las Vegas, but that could be false.

Like it always was, Tom is the only one who knows
what he's doing.

The Davidson baseball covered from his disastrous

team, which began practice
last week, will hold a fall
game with Pfeiffer College
this afternoon at the base-
ball field.

Coach Tom Stevens said
.that the game will give him
a chance to see some of the
new players, especially pit-
chers, perform against the
caliber team Davidson will
face next spring.

Game time is 3 P.ny

In the national collegiate
golf tournament this sommer,
Davidson's golfers finished
a respectable 23rd in a
large field.

Davidson's Mike Spann re-

rounds at the Southern Con-
ference Tournament to lead
the team, and placed 20th

Davidson's athletic teams
were either the best in the
conference last year or the
worst, depending on the way
you approach the question.

In 11 conference sports, Da-
vidson finished first in three
(to- tie with William and
Mary), and last in six (more
than any other school).

Davidson won the basket-
ball, golf and tennis crowns,
and finished last .in baseball,

SOCCER COACH HARRY FOGLEMAN
Optimistic about squad’s chances.

Soccer Squad
Has High Hopes

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Sports Writer

“We plan to win ‘em all!”
is the emphatic statement of
Coach Harry Fogleman about
the possibilities of the Wild.
cat soccer team for the 1968
season.

If experience and deter-
mination have anything to do
with it, this year’s squad cer-
tainly has the power to cap.
ture the Southern Conference
title.

Last year’s team was com-
posed mainly of freshmen
and sophomores, most of
whom will be returning to
action this fall).

Fogleman has five experi-
enced seniors as a nucleus
of a fine team, and he can
also choose from among 16
freshmen, the largest num-
ber of freshmen ever to try
out for the team. All of these
freshmen booters have had
previous playing experience.

Fogleman looks for the
Wildacts to have a strong
defensive club since both of
last year's fullbacks are re-
turning. Another returnee is

er, Cliff Patterson. a junior
and captain of the team.

Back on offense are five
of last year’s explosive team
members. Bill Horton, Roger
Peterson. Randy Carter Bay-
ard Miller and John Bruner.

Horton is probably the
most capable on offense,
with good dribbling ability
and extremely strong shots
with either leg.

Peterson, a sophomore,
plays the wing opposite

Horton. As a freshman tast |

season he was one of the
best dribblers on the team.
Fogleman expects him’ to
be one of the strongest
players on the squad.

Carter, Miller and Bruner
are explosive players, and
Fogleman feels their ‘speed
and quickness will aid the
team tremendously.

Back at goalie position are
two veterans, Harry Hamil
and Eddie Rice, both sen-
iors.

Among the new faces are
two freshmen goalies, Char-
lie Heiner and Steve Culbert-
son, who have shown fine
potential in practice sessions.
Other newcomers are three
foreign students, Mike Lunn
of England, Bjorn Bjarnason
of Iceland and Maurice Fon-
son of Cameroun, West Af-
rica.

Coach Foglemaen admit.
ted that his team is not in
top condition yet, since

day’s match with Method.

Awesome Cavaliers Test
,'* Improving Cats Tomorrow

By BOB DUNHAM
Sports Editor

All of the questions about
the toughness of Wildcat foot-
ballers will be answered to-
morrow when the up-and.
coming Wildcats match guns
with the highly-favored Uni-
versity of Virginia.

Davidson will rely on the
skillful passing of Gordon
Slade to score and the tough

Slade will have two main
targets in Mike Kelly, who
caught 10 passes against
Richmond last week. and
George Hannen. last year's
leading receiver who is now
back at full strength after a
battle with the mumps.

Kerry Keith will run from
the fullback slot against the
big Virginia line, in an effort
to improve last week's poor
rushing attack.

Homer and Butler will
have their hands full in con-
taining the speed and drive
of quarterback Gene Arnette
and All-American candidate
tailback Frank Quayle.

Virginia comes into the

game fresh from a 47-0 rout’

of VMI, while the Wildcats
bring two losses to-Scott Sta-
dium, where 25,000 students

Virginia gained early ex-
perience this season in an
encounter with Purdue, ‘now

The Cavaliers lost that con-
test, 44-13.

All- Everything Mckver
Enjoying Coaching Role

By BOB WALLACE
Sports Writer —

When most coaches begin
to consider hanging up their
cleats and retiring to the
sportsman’s proverbial
“armchair.”’ freshmen foot-
ball coach Gene McEver has
reopened the pages of a col-
orful football career after an
absence of 19 years.

Although his college days

“at the University of Tennes-

see were a long time before’
any Davidson student follow.
ed the nation's grid powers.
McEver stil! occupies many
a page in the Vols’ book of
standards. Also occupying
his own niche in thé football
hall of fame, the new fresh-
men mentor is easily one of
the greatest running backs
in the annals of college foot-
ball.

With the unique distinction -

of never playing on a losing
team, McEver led the Uni-
versity of Tennessee to the
heights of footbail stardom
in the years 1927 to 1931.
Although an injury kept him
out of the 1930 season. Mc-
Ever has accumulated a full
plumage of grid feats.

With a tally of 130 points
in 1929, the flashy back led
all college point makers and
was bestowed his first All-
American rating. The “TD
maker’ came back strong in
1931 for his second starting
position amongst the nation's
best.

As for records, McEver
played at a time when
sportswriters were not as
meticulous with the ‘stats’
as they are today, but his
three year point total of 296,
and his rushing standards
are still tops at the Knoxville
school.

Of the slew of McEver ex-
periences, the game whick
stood out the most occurred
in 1928, ‘‘when the bunch of
us ragamuffins from Ten.
nessee went down to Bir-
mingham to play that giant
of grid powers, Alabama.

“fT got the opening kickoff

and ran it back 98 yards for
the score, and we went on to
upset the Crimson Tide 15-
13. I guess in truth we had
no license even being on the
same field as Alabama, but
that win started the upswing
for Tennessee.”

He added with a sly grin,
“It was the only game they
lost that year!”

But Coach McEver is no
stranger to Davidson foot.
ball or coaching. From 1932
to 1943 (football was dropped
here in 1943), McEver work-

questioned about outstanding
records. ‘‘We compiled a 6-3

Big End Kelly
Shines In Defeat

By RUSS MERRITT
Sports Writer

The conversation at the
football coaches’ training ta-
ble shifted from freshman
phys ed, politics and the cake
race to Mike Kelly, a more
satisfying subject.

“Mike's been playing ev-
ery day, and his game im.
Proves with each outing,”
Coach Homer Smith said of
the big end. ‘He's been a
real leader on this football
tem this year."

Such ‘praise is nothng new
for Kelly, who starred in
high school for his: North
-Mecklenburg team. While at
North, he set the Shrine Bowl
record. for touchdown pass
receptions and was regarded
as one of the outstanding
prep gridders in the country.

Stardom didn't stop there
for Kelley, either. as the 6-4,
195-pounder was so impres-
sive as a freshman that he
was tabbed ‘‘one of the best
football athletes ever to at-
tend Davidson."

When talking about last
week's 24-14 loss to Rich-
mond, Smith found it diffi.
‘cult not to menton Kelly
when reviewing the good
points of the Wildcat attack.

**Mike played his best foot-
ball game ever against Rich-
mond last Saturday night,"

Smith said. “He's a good,
tough player and a real out.
standing receiver.”

The lavish compliments
don't stop there. Other mem-
bers of the staff make such
comments as “his blocking
is 100 per cent improved.”
“he's a great downfield
blocker.”’ and “he is a com-
plete receiver, with speed,
agility, hands and brains.”

In the encounter with the
Spiders, Kelly gathered in 10
passes, one shy of the school
record set last year by
George Hannen. Two of his
catches accounted for the
Wildcat touchdowns, each go-
ing for 35 yards.

Many persons wonder how
a bonafide superstar feels
playing for a team that
hasn't shown much promise
thus far.

“I enjoy playing for Da-
vidson."' Kelly said. “There
is really not much that can
be said after losing the first
two games, but something,
can be done, and we're go-
ing to do it.”

To listen to Kelly, you
would think that he is just
a run-of-the-mill cellege
player. “My game's all right
so far.’ he will modestly
contend. ‘I guess I’m doing
all right.”
