(CPS)—The political. up-
heaval surrounding Iranian and
other Middle Eastern students
on American campuses pro-
bably won’t dissuade colleges
from signing up more foreign
students in the years to come,
according to various inter-
national student advisers.

Though schools may suffer
some ‘‘public relations prob-
lems” by enrolling large num-
bers of foreign students, Wil-
liam Bray of the National
Association of Foreign Stu-
dent Affairs (NAFSA) says
they aren’t great enough to
prevent those enrollments’
growth.

“There are two problems the
university faces with foreign
students on campus,’’ Bray
says. ‘The first is mechanical.
Foreign students need special
programs and facilities to help
them. The second is public
relations. Americans don’t
easily acéépt people who are
different.”

Yet economic need will help
blunt college concern about
public image. Some colleges,
concerned about the decline in
the number of native-born po-
tential students, have already

Mid East students still here

become dependent on the foreig-
ners.

Fqreigners currently make up
between four and seven percent
of the total American college
student populace. There are
projections the number could
hit ten percent by 1990.

Given the stakes, few schools
seem willing to adopt policies
that could substantially change
those projections. Mankato
State University in Minnesota,
for example, plans to continue
enrolling foreign students de-
spite a potentially disastrous
public relations flap last No-
vember.

That’s when, just after the
seizure of the American em-
bassy in Teheran, five foreign
students—four Iranian and one
Sudanese—at Mankato were
arrested after the police got a
tip the students were about to
kidnap Minnesota Governor Al-
bert Quie. A rifle was found in
the car of one of the students.

_ The charges proved to be
groundless (the rifle was ap-
parently for a hunting trip), but
the uproar potentially threat-
ened Mankato’s budget request
in the state legislature. Man-
kato, however, maintains plans
to enroll more foreign students.

Urban League head to speak at Convocation Friday

By SUSAN WOODIE

Assistant Features Editor

In a 1978 ‘‘Reader’s Digest”’
article on Vernon E. Jordan Jr.,
the story is told of his first time
at a National Urban League
meeting: ‘‘The day Jordan
walked into his first board
meeting, the entire board stood
up and applauded. ‘He hadn’t
opened his mouth yet,’ said one
awed witness. It is that com-
manding presence—the unmis-
takable quality of leadership—
with which more and more
Americans are becoming fam-
iliar.”’

‘Sup: ‘tutoring, in the sun.

Jordan will be the guest
speaker at the annual Spring
Awards Convocation to be held
Friday, April 25 at 11:00 a.m.
in Love Auditorium. Some
twenty awards will be presented
at the convocation to students
who have demonstrated excel-
lence in academics, athletics,
and community service. Jordan
will be awarded the honorary
degree of Doctor of Laws in
recognition of his many achieve-
ments.

Jordan is acting executive
director of the National Urban
League, a position he has held

since 1972. Under his director-
ship, the League has become
possibly the best financed and
most professionally staffed of
the civil rights organizations.
The League has 116 local affil-
iates, collectively employing a
staff of over 3000 and disburs-
ing more than $100 milllion‘a
year.

Services of the National Ur-
ban League include job-training
and placement; educational,
social-welfare, and housing pro-
grams for the black community;
and “advocacy to government,
business, and union leaders of

the cause of minority economic
advancement.”’

A native of Atlanta, Jordan
is a graduate of DePauw
University and Howard Univer-
sity Law School. He holds
honorary degrees from more
than 30 colleges and univer-
sities, including Duke, Yale,
Boston College, and Tuskegee
Institute. Among his numerous
past titles and notable achieve-
ments are executive director of
the United Negro College Fund,
Georgia field director for the
NAACP, member of the Board
of Directors of the American
Museum of Natural History,
and a member of the Presi-
dential Clemency Board.

“‘Reader’s Digest’’ describes
Jordan as a “man of vibrant

‘personality and commanding

presence—one of the nation’s
pre-eminent advocates for his
people.”’ He certainly looks the
part of people’s advocate. A
six-foot-four-inch, broad-
chested figure, Jordan displays
a ready smile and a glint of
merriment in his large, quick-
darting eyes. His lectures are
well-received, delivered with an
air of easy camfaderie, self-

- confidence, and wit.

He has been said to inhabit
two worlds: In one, he is the

forceful black civil-rights lead- '

er, crusading for an ‘‘open,

- integrated, pluralistic society,”

and fond of saying, ‘‘The 1960's
involved the legal battle to eat
in the same restaurant with
whites. The task now is to earn
the money to pay for that
meal.”’ In the other world, he is
Vernon Jordan, the business
executive, a-member of the
board of six major corporations,
among them American Ex-

, Press, . , Banker’ 8 Trust, and”

Xerox.’

nature areas

Even at Davidson, not all
education comes from a class-
room. Evidence of this is the
Biology department’s extensive
use of college-owned properties
accessible to ‘“‘budding”’ botan-
ists, entomologists, ecologists

and zoologists. Few students

* realize exactly how much plant

and soil testing actually goes on
around town.

Such places as Morgan’s
Bluff, Glen Alpine Springs, and
McConnell’s Pond provide ideal
environments for a variety of

biological studies. A beautiful
river bluff and shale cliff in
Stanley County, N.C. is owned
jointly by Davidson and UNCC.
Morgan’s Bluff was acquired by
the two schools primarily for
preservation of its unusual flo-
ra. Destined to becoine a hous-
ing development had it not been
purchased, the bluff was recent-
ly added to the Register of
Natural Heritage Areas, instru-
mental in ‘‘preservation of
North Carolina’s natural diver-
sity.”

Glen Alpine Springs is lo-
cated in Burke County, N.C.,
two hours west of Davidson. It
consists of approximately 250
acres of wooded mountains on
the site of an old resort hotel.
The resort burned, and little
remains of the place except a
few plants and some cement °
foundations. The College sold
the gravel rights to the bottom
lands but the trees and shrubs
are growing back to reclaim the
land. The College is now seek-
ing to retain this property as a
natural educational preserve.

Perhaps of more interest to
amateur ecologists and zoolo-
gists is McConnell’s Pond, lo-
cated east of Davidson on

’ Concord Road. The land, which

was named after a Davidson
physician, was given to the
College with the intention that
the property incl a devel-
opment for faculty . Pres-
ently ecology and zoology stu-
dents alike use it for course
projects. It is ideally located
because it can be reached by
bicycle or on foot.

Until recently, students wor-
ked on projects in Egg Rock
Woods, the woods most often
used by the Biology depart-
ment. Unfortunately, the woods
have been clear cut for timber,
destroying the habitat of the
pileated woodpecker, a popular
specimen for observation.

This action has initiated
many questions concerning the
preservation of land, which
Biology Professor Dr. Tom
Daggy calls “our natural heri-
tage.” Daggy feels “it is the
duty of higher education to
preserve our heritage in litera-

ture. and the ae Mae

nature.”
