REPORTS ON STATE VOLUN. |
TEER CONFERENCE TO BE
PRESENTED AT NEXT “Y”
MEETING.

The “Y” meeting next Sunday will
feature a most attractive program. Price
and Cunningham, who were among the
delegates to the State Student Votuntecr |
Conference, will make a report to the
student body. This report will be in-
formal, and is certain to be interesting, |
for this has been unquestionably the
greatest conference that has ever been
held in the State. Then, too, these are
men who can'say what they have to say
in a live, interesting way. The musical |
part of the service will include songs by |
a quartet of the delegates: Price, '22;
Beck, '23; Buchanan, ‘23; Ted Jones, ‘24.
Also, if possible, there will be some
music by the girls visiting for Junior
Speaking.

Miss Bonnie Shelton, who has been
teaching at Woodleaf, N. C., spent the
weck-end at home.

The missionary pageant “In the Name

proved one of the most interesting fea-

ability and costuming showed excep-
tional talent possessed by these young
ladies.

Agnes Ayres as the wife of a man who
will not support her finds it necessary
to work for a rich family, the Maltlorys.
A young oil magnate, Rogers, who Mr.
Mallory hoped to ally with his own in- |
terests, is persuaded to stay to a dinner
party given by Mrs. Mallory. Complica-
tions arise by which Mr. Rogers’ dinner
partner cannot be present and it is nec-
essary to ask Mary to take her place.
She was perfumed by Coty, gowned by
‘| Potiere and’ bejewelled by Tiffany to
such an extent that Mr. Rogers falls in
love with her.

Dreams must end though and Mary
returns to the drudgery of a home and
maltreatment by her husband Disgusted
with him, she accepts Mrs. Mallory’s
offer of a week-end house party at which
Mr. Rogers is the principal guest. While
there her husband, coming to rob the
house, finds her and she has to disclose
her identity to Rogers. She tells him
she loves him but because of her hus-
band cannot marry him.

Again she returns home to a husband
who trys to “bleed” Rogers by demand-
ing ten thousand dollars of him. Rogers
brings the money and Mary tells him to
choose—Money or Mary. He chooses
