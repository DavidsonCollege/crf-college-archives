D.C. Songs’ History Revealed

Davidson has two college songs
that are traditionally used, one the
Alma Mater and the other, the
Fight Song. “O Davidson” was
written by B. Ernest Shields, of
the Class of 1920, and it is now
published in piano and band. ar-
rangements by the Thornton W. Al-
len Company of New York City.
He also wrote the national dream
girl song of Pi Kappa Alpha.

Until several years ago, "O Da-
vidson” was used for all occasions;
however, it is definitely a fight
song and was not very fitting to
be used on occasions such as com-
mencement and college functions
where athletic spirit was not pre-
dominant. Need was felt for a real
Alma Mater.

When Davidson planned the Cen-
tennial Celebration in 1937, an
alumnus, Dr. G. M. Maxwell of
Roanoke, Va., Class of 1896, sent
in a manuscript with a melody on
it written in 6/8 time and with the
words to “All Hail, O Davidson.”
He sent it to be used as a fight
song in the Centennial campaign.

After looking it over, it occurred
to James Christian Pfohl, former
director of the Music Department,
that here was the background for
a real Alma’ Mater song, if by
changing the rhythm from 6/8 to
4/4 tempo and harmonizing the
melody in a very dignified and
hymn-like style, a song of great
dignity would result. This was
done, and it is now what we use
for the Alma Mater, “All Hail, O
Davidson.”

— In Paper From Music Dept.

It is published in piano form by [|

The Thornton W. Allen Company.
At first, the students would not
take.to the use of this new sony.
They wanted nothing bur “O Da-
vidson,” but through the years if
has been used by the musical or-
ganizations Cand alumni ‘organiza-
tions) and is now considered tradi-
tionally as the. Alma Mater.
These- two songs are excellent
college songs. Each has its place
and each is truly a Davidson Col-
lege sony. in that they were both
written by an alumnus, and to be
a good Alma Mater, a song should
be inspired by one’s Jove and de-
votion for one’s own school.
Other songs have been written
for Davidson College, but these two
are the ones which have, through
traditional use, established them-
selves as the official college songs,
and whenever they are heard,
thoughts of alumni and friends
turn to the Davidson campus.
Among the other prominent songs
pertaining to Davidson is the one
entitled “The Red and Black"
(Alma Mater—Davidson College),
the words by Prof. W. P. Cum-
ming, Class of 1921, and the music
by Mr. K. M. Scott, Class of 1937.
This song was published by the
Intercollegiate Music League, Inc.,
in 1938 in its folio called “Songs of
the American Colleges” (Central
and Southern Group). And the last
song that can be brought to mind
is the one composed by Fred War-
ing, Pat Ballard and Roy Ring-
