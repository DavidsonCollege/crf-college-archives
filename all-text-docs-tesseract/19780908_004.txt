A Tool and a Monument

— {Last night in the Morrison Room. about__ regularly pay students to man the turnte-

two dozen freshmen witnessed a scene
' that will become famillar to them during
their years at Davidson. The freshmen
came to ‘the organizational meeting of
radio station WDAV; what they saw and

heard were the protests of angry upper-.

classmen claiming that, no matter how
much is said about cooperation and

communication between administrators.

and students at Davidson, precious little
actually occurs.

When the administration made serious
moves towards establishing a high-power

radio station at Davidson, a few years ago
.. The Davidsonian and others sought speci-.

fics of the plan. “Everything is very
tentative,” we’ were told, “and we'll
establish policy as we go along, always in
cooperation with and in the best interests
of students.” Many were skeptical, stil!
feared administrative takeover, but most
were pacified, and the high-power plans
went on. Where are we today?

Today President Spencer issues a
directive that 50 percent classical music
programming is an absolute minimum, no
questions, no discussion. Executive Di-
rector Lovell proposes a schedule with 80
percent classical programming and won-
‘ders out loud if the station will have to

bies since all volunteers will have fost
interest. And the adrninistration teminds
us that we have all forgotten that WDAV is
“a College station rather than a student
activity. Responsibility for administration
continues to rest, as it has from the
beginning, in the. College's Gommunica-
tions Department.”

It’s beginning to sound as if the skeptics
were correct a few years back. Will WDAV,
SO cornicemed with a “consistent image”
become a new Update, which is a “College
newspaper, not a student activity. " .

A tool of the administration, and a
monument of adminstrative inflexibility
towards students—that is the WDAV of.
the future.

The student staff of WDAV ts: to be
commended for its insistence that the
Gollege talk honestly about its future
plans for WDAV. The Davidsonian encou-
rages the administration to lift its heavy
hand from WDAV, free it from the fetters .
of big-money budgets and creeping pre-
professionalism, and allow an ambitious
group of Davidson students to discover
their own potential and offer a diverse

‘alternative in radio broadcasting. —— -—

Report from
N. C. PIRG
DAVIDSON CHAPTER
On July 25 of this year, a

unique baby was born to an
Oldham, England couple.
Through the efforts of Drs.
Patrick Steptoe and Robert
Edwards, Mr. and Mrs. G. J.
Brown, though sterile, were
able to have a biiby girl con
ceived in vitro (literally “
glass," in a test tube). What is
the nature and potential of
artificial fertilization, and what
ethical-issues does it raise?.

We asked this of Dr. J. F.
Hutka, Professor of Obstetrics
and Gynecology at Chapel Hill.
An authority in his field, Dr.
Hulka will be working this
winter with Steptoe and Ed-
wards to bring the technique to
North Carolina.

Dr. Hulka, what is the histo-
ry and the future as you see it of
artificial fertilization?

This technique has been

known to be possible in animals |

(mice, rabbits, rats) for about
10 to 12 years and has been
pursued persistently by Steptoe
and Edwards for the past 10
years in human beings. In the
human beings, enormous prob-
lems were faced by Steptoe and
Edwards in the ethical recovery
of eggs to be reimplanted in
patients who had concomitant
disease which made the proce-

dure necessary. The. reason it.

took the team ten years to
develop the solutions to these
problems was due to the multi-
ple.concerns of ethical safe-

guard of the patient, rather
than the embryos. The break-
through came a year ago from a
related field of reproductive

men’s blood could be monitored

Do you foresee any: cihioal

depentient of nature?

The ethics of this situation,
derived from the fact that
desperately infertile couples are.
seeking help from a physician or
from a team of scientists to
accomplish their objective: a
normal live birth. I do not
know, nor can I conceive of any

or scientists devo-
ting their energies towards any
other objective at this or any
other time. Thus, the objectives
of making birth more indepen-
dent of nature seem remote. I
should add.,. parenthetically,
that I know of no mammalian
system in which an egg has
been fertilized and carried out-
side the maternal body to the
point of delivery and life. This
applies to mice as well as men.
Therefore, I do not anticipate
an Orwellian scene of babies
being grown in incubators out-
side of mothers. Biology is
enormously difficult to repro-
duce with the mere intelligence
of man.

What does the procedure
involve and what risks do the
mother and child incur?

The procedure involves. col-
‘ecting the egg at the right time
of the cycle by laparoscopy.

iteelf is done ap-
proximately 300,000 times a
year in the United States with a
mortality no greater than that
of women taking the birth
control pill. The risk of the
procedure, thus, is minimal.
Risks that the mother takes
after implantation are the usual
risks of abortion (possibly
higher in these inseminations),
ectopic pregnancy ing in
the tube rather than in the
uterus) which is a life threaten-
ing emergency situation, and
other riske that are common to

“ of increased abnormal babies. If

the egg is to be damaged
within the firet five days, the

. damage will probably be so

besic as to be lethal and to lead
to no implantation at all or early
abortion. This is, to the best of

| my knowledge, the

éaperience
from. enimel. enimel. investigntion. In

other words, a@ successful in

has been carried beyond the
point past abortion in
animals and probably in hu-
yoans as well. a,
