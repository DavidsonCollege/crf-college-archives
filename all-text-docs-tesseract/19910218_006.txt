1991Student Government Elections: Questions & Answers

Worah: \ think the SGA will have
to work closely with the PCC and
the administration in order to de-
termine any changes.

Joe Cook
I'd like to start off by stating to
you some of my reasons for run-
ning for SGA vice president, and
to tell you some of the things I can
add to the SGA in that role.
First, I enjoy serving the stu-
dent body. Throughout my fresh-
man and sophomore years, I have
been very involved and have de-
veloped a keen interest in staying
abreast of the many issues that
come up at Davidson and taking
part in finding solutions, or atleast
exploring the options that each
issue presents.
Secondly, I feel like the vice

presidency will utilize several of
my stronger characteristics which
have been developed during my
first two'years on the SGA.
Third, I think that the SGA has
a great opportunity to increase its
participation in many different
campus activities and events. I

president is in charge of all the
SGA committees, the individual
should be abreast of all the issues
on campus. They have to channel
all the different student ideas and
reactions into the SGA committees
in order to enhance the SGA’s
productivity. A big part of the vice
president’s job is appointing the
right people to various commit-
tees, and I think that I have the
contacts and judgment to do that.
Like I said before, the vice presi-
dency will utilize some of my
stronger characteristics. I enjoy
listening to people and I think I
understand what they are trying to
tell me. Secondly, I enjoy taking
people’s suggestions and explor-
ing options rather than just stating
the way things have to be. Third, I
am very organized.
It seems that my time is up, and
so I’llend this here. Thank you.

Davidsonian: What do you think
sets you above the other candi-
dates?

Cook: | think that I have devel-
oped a keen interest in staying
abreast of the campus issues. I feel
like I am able to listen to several
points of vicw and channel them
into a workable solution.”

Davidsonian: One of the com-
plaints about the SGA has been the
relative lack of communication
between senators and their con-
stituents. How do you intend to
overcome this problem?”

Cook: One way we’ ve been able to
improve SGA interaction with the
campus has been through The
Davidsonian. The SGA news ar-
ticle helps keep people informed.
One thing I think we need is a
suggestion box for students, one
that’s checked often. I also think
that senators need to go out and ask
they’re constituents about various
issues.”

Davidsonian: Please tell us about
your experiences with the Solidar-
ity Committee.

I think I have developed a keen interest in stay-
ing abreast of the campus issues. I feel like I
am able to listen to several points of view and
channel them into a workable solution. |

think we’ve started, but there’s
still an awful lot to be done. From
my experience on the SGA I have
developed an idea of where we
should go.

Going on, during my freshman
year I was aclass senator, and now
Iam sophomore class president. I
feel that this has been a wonderful
experience to serve the student
body and my class. I feel that my
contact with my constituents was
one of the key reasons that I was
reelected last year. I feel very
comfortable in addressing differ-
ent people, listening to their con-
cerns, and trying to convey what
they tell me to the SGA.

I think that the vice president

needs to have constant interaction
with the campus. Since the vice-

Cook: One of the biggest things
we’ve discovered has been the
apathy in regard to minority af-
fairs. Even when there was such an
enormous reaction to the idea of a
black fraternity coming to
Davidson, when we had a forum
about it, participation was mini-
mal. Other than the members of
the BSC, most students ignored the
forum.

Another issue is minority repre-

sentation on the SGA, whether the —

independents should have a vote,
or whether the status quo should be
kept. Yet another is the level of
minority faculty recruitment,

The SGA sponsored a forum
about a month ago which included
different members of the Union
Board, Patterson Court houses, the
BSC, and the Senate. Doug Jobe

will be releasing a report on the
forum which contains several of
the new ideas which were ex-
pressed. I think that’s a great step.

Davidsonian: Can you tell me
some things that the SGA is ca-
pable of changing and needs to
change? Be specific.

Cook: Academic policies -- the
length of the semesters and the
number of credits it takes to gradu-
ate. I think the SGA needs to target
the lack of student morale around
the basketball team. I think also
that there’sa bureaucracy building
around Davidson, in regard to the
Baker Sports Complex. I think we
can go back to the open campus
ethic. We all live under the honor
code, we’re all Davidson students.

Davidsonian: How do you feel
about the possibility of the col-
lege’s athletic status? Do you
support a Division change?

Cook: Idon’tthink, from what the
Trustees have said, that we’ re going
to have to make that decision any-
time soon. I think we’ve got a
great balance with Division I bas-
ketball and Division III football.
We’ ve got great promise in regard
to recruitment, thanks to the great
job Terry Holland and Bob McK-
illop have been doing. I think we
definitely need Division I basket-
ball, and Division II football, I
hope we’re not going to have to
change our status.

Laura Cunningham

Since I’ve been a freshman
senator on the SGA, I’ve learned
what a huge difference effective
student government can make at
Davidson, and I know that my
energies are going towards some-
thing worthwhile. I figure that

i
fe
&

running for vice president is my
big chance to do something for the
Davidson community and make as

big a difference as possible. This
is where my talents lie.

One big job of the vice presi-
dent is to preside over the SGA
committees. There are standing
committees and faculty commit-
tees and they have to work to-
gether with the senate to do the
work so that the senate can meet.

I’ve been on several. Right

Cunningham: Idon’tthink I know
enough tobe president. The candi-
dates who are running for that of-
fice are all very qualified for the
job, and they know a lot more
about it thanI do. Icouldn’trunan
SEC meeting. é

I have a knowledge of the
committees that I think no other
candidate for VP has, and that

I feel that I can handle the behind-the-scenes
work, but I like to do both. I'd like to make the
committees more visible.

now I’m the chairperson of the
Charters and By-laws Committee,
and I’m in the process of renewing
the charters of various organiza-
tions. I feel like I know the By-
laws as well as anyone on the sen-
ate. I’ve also been on the Activi-
ties Tax Council, and I’ve learned
about how different organizations
get budgeted, and how the SGA
works out the budget. The vice
president is supposed to help the
SGA work out a budget, and I feel
like my experience of knowing
where the money goes and where it

comes from will really help me’

there.

The vice president is also in-
volved with many councils, the
Athletic Council, CCRL, Student
Conduct Council. I feel that my
experience at Davidson has been
very diverse, and I feel that ‘the
input I would have from so many
different people would help me
generate the correct output in those
councils.

Another thing that makes me
more qualified is that I havea lot of
drive and a unique perspective.
My roommate once said to me,
“Laura, once you get started on
something, you just don’t stop!’
and I feel that that is one quality
that the vice presidentreally needs
to have. I feel like if you were to
put me into aroom, I would go for
the doors, I would go for the win-
dows, the ceiling, the floor, until I
found a good way outof thatroom.
That’s basically it.

Davidsonian: If you are elected

vice president, how will your han- .

dling of the job differ from Kristi
Kessler’s?

Cunningham:
Kessler has worked more behind
the scenes, and that’s just because
of her personality. I feel that I can
handle the behin- the-scenes work,
but I like to do both. I’d like to
make the committees more vis-
ible. Last spring a lot of very
qualified people didn’t sign up for
faculty committees because they
didn’t know about them. —Stu-

_dents have a tremendous voice in

determining direction. It’s a re-
source that needs to be more fully

Kristi Kessler has done a great
job, I just think my personality is a
bit different.

Davidsonian: Why did youchoose

torun for vice president instead of

president”

I think Kristi _

qualifies me most for the vice presi-
dency.

Davidsonian: | see that youare on
the Security Committee. What
steps have you taken in regard to
campus security?

Cunningham: That committee
hasn’t been very active this year
because Doug Jobe has taken a lot
of that responsibility on himself. I
won’t tell you what I think of his
doing that. Last year, several of us
on the committee got together to
spy on the police officers. I re-:
member Mike Ott and I sat outside
of Quincy’s one night for a good
two hours while both campus po-
lice officers were eating.

Kim Short and Mary Dempster
have basically worked with Doug,
and the committee itself has not
been as active as it was.

Ben Gilmer
My name is Benjamin Gilmer.
I’m running for SGA vice presi-

dent. Ihaven’t been involved with
the SGA so far, but I have a lot of
energy.

I think we’re in kind of a latent
period as fara politics goes, Fdon’t
think there’s much campus in-
volvement, I don’t see much inter-
action between student body and
the SGA, That’s something I’d
like to change.

I'd like to go back to basics. I’d
like to reunite and redirectcampus —
energy, and break these communi-
