peared in this column sometime back stating
that a certain cafe frequented by Davidson
students had eliminated free phone service.

A short paragraphic ap-

The grounds taken for this action was based’

upon the fact that students talking over the
telephone for extended periods, caused the es
tablishment to loose considerable trade. This
concern advertises in all our publications and
does not wish to infringe upon any privileges.

COUNCIL SET-UP ... The future Pan-Hel-
lenie Council set-up is probably the most de-
bated question of the week, and so it should
be since it controls, to a-great degree, the so-
cial life of the student body. The fifty-fifty
scheme between fraternities and councilmen
seems to be the safest system, unless the
Greek lodges are willing to take the chance
for more profit. Then, too, the less the council
representative has an opportunity of making,
the less he will try to fulfill his duties effi-
ciently. At least, such is human nature.

CEILING SPOT ... Reports have it that the

others have inspected the faulty place. Light-

that problem in relation to the stage. So the
college has not been inactive about these two

much griped-about things.

ELECTION RESULTS .. . Sometimes it al-
most seems unfair that the student body in its
entirety can not participate in elections. Many
men are taken away from the campus by var-
ious sport and debating trips. And the closer
an election runs, the more these absent men
might sway an election result. Not that we
advocate fewer trips, but a better system.

DEADWOOD ... And such was the not al-
together complimentary word used in refer-
ence to several honorary fraternities. An or-
ganization is not much good if it only meets
enough to justify its need to the council. It
should have some definite purpose and func-
tion. Of course, in the opinion of some stu-
dents, honoraries are merely a matter of rec-
ognition. However we think they should be
more, unless they reach the point where the
members are forced to neglect other things of
more importance. An honorary can be over-
active also though.

To the Editor...

DEAR DICK:

With the question of re-organizing the
Pan-Hellenic Coungil ‘in the limelight, the
following plan has been suggested :

That each of the fraternities provide a cer-
tain specified sum of money in the fall which
could be used by the Council as working capi-
tal in giving the first dance of the year, and
that the fraternities back the Pan-Hellenic
Council 100 per cent on any possible losses
and receive at the end of the schgol year 75
per cent of any profits made during the year.

The remaining 25 per cent would be given
to the members of the Council as a commis-
sion for their services to the fraternity group.
Thus the Council would no longer exist as an
independent grotip and would be acting only
as the agent for the fraternities. é

It seems that such a plan would add to the
efficiency of the Pan-Hellenic Council and at
the same time put the profits in the right

suggestions now and then.

In keeping in line with the critical compon-
ent, I would like to mention a word or two
concerning our church attendance and atti-
tude.

You know, as well as 1, that our attitude to-
ward the speaker is not what it should be.
| doubt that there is a student in church, un-
less he be on the front row, who cannot see
in front of him three-or more boys nodding
or asleep. At that remark | some
of you will “rise up in arms,” but let us look
at the situatioi’ from a different standpoint.

suppose

Place yourself in the speaker's position.
How do you think you would feel to look out
upon an audience, half of whom are nodding ?
No, you could not speak nearly as well as you
could if all seemed interested and attentive.
One doesn’t necessarily have to sit exactly
upright to seem attentive, but should assume
something more thai a lazy stumped position.

I know how difficult it is to follow the
speaker at times, but you will grant that we
secure some of the best speakers in the South
for Our vesper programs. We should show
our appreciation for such calibre of men.

Personal opinions from others have not
caused me to write this comment. I don’t
know "what you — you reading these words
right now—think about the situation, but I
would like to know what some of you do
think.

I hope that you readers will not take this
to be a deeply rooted criticism, fort is only
an appeal to you to aid in making our services
more attractive and more enjoyable.

ITS IN THE AIR... We glanced through
the pages of ye paper last Monday night, for
a change, and noted to our surprise the pre-
dominating note. It seems that this ‘year,
spring brings sweet thoughts of pageants,
beauty contests and the like. We can’t quite
understand it, but guess it’s all right.

LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL ... “Twenty beauti-
ful contestants,” whose number had dwindled
to ten, paraded before judges and audience in
a beauty contest held in the Davidson High
School last Friday night. Miss' Martha With-
ers, daughter of Dr. J. J. Withers, local phy-
sician, won first place.. Miss Jean Byers of
Cornelius, was chosen second. :

The “Spinsters’ Skip” is the name of a “la-

When lessons, meetings, plays and outside
activities pile up on the calendars of the girls

Day,” 24 hours during which students can do
what they please.

TENNS TOURNAMENT

Forty Enter Tournament to
Determirie Davidson High
School Team

The Davidson High School ten-
nis tournament has progressed
through two rounds and is sched-
uled to be completed some time
next week. About forty entrants
took part in the first two rounds.

Bill Wood is seeded number 1,
John Gibson at number 2, Price
Gwynn at number 3, and Ducks
Pharr number 4. Others who have
showed good form to date and are
expected to give the favorites plen-
ty of trouble are Jimmy Fulcher,
Bob Ballard, Edward Maxwell and
Frank Caldwell.

In a practice match a team se-
lected from the likely winners in
the tournament lost to a powerful
Mooresville High team, 9-0. Gibson
playing at number three took the
first set from his opponent, but
then dropped two duced affairs.
Pharr at number 5 dropped an ex-
tremely close decision. :

Lack of practice was said to be
the main fault in the first match,
A return match with Mooresville
and several other tentative matches
are on tab for the near future.

Miss Johnston, better known as
“Dot” around Davidson, was a co-

on the school honor roll. She grad-
uated from Davidson High School
with highest honors and plans to
graduate from the University of

PAN-HELLENIC COUNCIL, the’”
problem child of Davidson, sug-

gests a solution to past financial
complications in one of the follow-
ing forms: First, that the members
of the Pan-Hell Council and the
fraternities sponsor the dances to-

gether. That is, profit and loss will
be divided equally between the
members and the fraternities. In

the past, the Councilmen have tak-
en any losses and all profits.

A second possible solution seems
to permit the fraternities to han-
dle all money matters through
their Pan-Hell representatives, The
Councilmen would receive a stated
amount for their work. Under eith-

‘ler program, the books would be

open for inspection at any reason-
able time. <A certified public ac-
countant would check the books at
the end of the year.

The first plan appears to be su-
perior to the second, because the
Pan-Hellenic members would have
more incentive to work. Individual
fraternities would not have to pass
on each band before a certain set
of dances, and a more conservative
basis would be used if the ~Pan-

Hellenic men were in a position to
lose their own money.

Everybody agrees-that a consti-
tution for the Pah-Hell group
should be drawn up and a better
system of financing dances be in-
stalled before the new representa-
tives take over the Davidson dance
proposition. The present Pan-Hell
is working on the above additions
and hope to put them through.
