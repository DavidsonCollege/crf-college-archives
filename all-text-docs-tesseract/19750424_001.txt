Campus crime drops 60 percent

Precinct Two thwarts criminal activity

Since the establishment of Precinct #2
on the Davidson campus in January,
1974, the crime rate at Davidson College
has dropped significantly.

“For the calendar year, 1973, there
were 74 reported larcenies and 5
assaults compared to 27 larcenies and 2
assaults in 1974-- a better than 60%
decrease,” stated Grover C. Meetze Jr,
Director of The Physical Plant.

Meetze’s figures were taken from a
report given him by Lt. Hughes, officer
in charge of the campus precinct. ‘These
figures do not reveal the entire story,”’
added Hughes, ‘‘for in 1973 there were
more thefts involving over $100 worth of
goods than this past year ”’

Precinct #2

Precinct #2 is part of the campus
security system Davidson initiated
several years ago. This system
basically involves the use of town police
as campus police and the operation of
the campus precinct. It was designed in
cooperation with the SGA and was ap-
proved by the Senate’s unanimous vote.

“Our security system is designed: to
overcome the problem of town police
versus campus police that hampered us
in the past and is ee on other
campuses,”’ said M

“With this Rane 2 ‘there are no
jurisdictional problems, and the David-
son police force is always available for
support, if we need it.

“The idea of the campus cop. is
psychologically old fashioned,’”’ con-
tinued Meetze. “Social patterns have
undergone a tremendous change in
recent years; students at Davidson
today are more like citizens of the com-
munity. If they need the police, all they
have to do is call.”

Hughes pointed out that the same
rules apply to’student rooms and dorms
as citizens’ homes.

“We cannot go into the dorms-unless
asked. Many students have the idea that
we work to discover drug violations,
but,’’ he emphasized, ‘‘this is not true.
Our only purpose here is to protect the
students.”

Open campus with controls

“This is an open campus, but some
control is necessary,’”’ Hughes con-
tinued. ‘“‘We have the option of asking
people what they are doing here, and we
can ask them to leave if they don’t
belong here.”’

A major advantage of the new system
is the instant attention students can
command 24 hours a day by dialing -
5131. No time is wasted searching for the
campus policeman.

Meetze sees other advantages ir in the
positive exposure to police the students
receive, the uniting of campus and com-
munity, and the flexibility of the system.

“Further restrictions should be un-
necessary because of the system’s
flexibility,’’ he commented.

Davidson College has a contract with
the town of Davidson that enlists the
cooperation of the Davidson police.

$16.000 annually

“The College pays the town of David-
son approximately $40,000 a year for
their services. This includes payment of
the officers, upkeep of the campus
precinct, and money spent on patrol
cars, uniforms, equipment, and further
education of the officers, among other
things,” Said Meetze.

Five Davidson police’officers work on
campus under the direction of Lt.
Hughes. “‘There are four full time men
on the force, including myself,’”’ stated
Hughes, ‘‘as well as two part time. All of
thése men are licensed and certified by
the state of N.C. They have at least the
-165 hours training required for. cer-

-Ten-four? Seven-eleven!

tification plus 40 hours advance
training.

“From 3 a.m. to 6 p.m. there is an of-
ficer on campus and another readily
available, though not necessarily on
campus. From 6 p.m. until 3 a.m. there
are two officers on duty, either walking:
around campus or patrolling the cam-
pus in a car.

Handsticks at night.

The equipment these officers wear is
not specified by Davidson College.
Hughes stated, ‘‘Most officers wear only
a gun and handcuffs in the day, as ! do,

_and add a handstick at night.”

In addition to the six officers from the
town force, the College has its own cam-
pus cop, “Cop Sherrill.”” He is directly
on the College’s payroll and, according
to Meetze, serves ‘‘an indispensable
security role.”’

His main duty is coordinating security
with campus activities, but he also helps
patrol the campus.

Another innovation of the new campus
security system is the emergency

phones on each floor of Watts dorm.

_ “Those phones connect directly to the
wwh-Station and have been used three
times for actual events, one of which
resulted in apprehension. It only takes a
matter of minutes for an officer to reach
the dorm when a call is received,” said

-Hughes.

Abuse of phones

“The phones are an effective security
measure and should not be treated

lightly,’’ he continued. ‘‘We have had a

problem with abuse of the phones. Dean
Will Terry has been sent to the dorm
several times to investigate this.”’

Included in Hughes’ responsibilities is
issuing I.D.’s to students, and vehicle
and bicycle registration. Next year
Hughes plans to issue I.D.’s to the
families of faculty members as well s
students. Giving parking tickets is the
responsibility of the Physical Plant Of-
fice, but this aspect of security is han-
dled by students.

A recent security measure not
initiated by Meetze is the installation of

the card-lock doors on Watts dorm and
the screens on the first floor windows of
the dorm.

“Security made no recommendations
concerning the card-lock doors. We
received a request rom the Dean’s office
to install the doors and the-name of the
company that Duke purchased their
card-lock doors from,”’ stated Meetze.

“The locks and doors for Watts cost
approximately $900,’’ he continued.
‘ The decision to install the doors was
made at a meeting of Dean of Students

Diane Stone, College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr, Meetze, Vice President
for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan
and Director of Student Housing Scotty
Nicolls in the summer of 1974.

“This decision was a joint one,” stated
Stone. “Security has been a natural con-
sideration since women first came. It
was thought for a while that_a free
system might work, but bedause of the

“T might as well say it: you
know, the help around here is
just afraid to go see Mr. Meetze
or Stephenson when we has got
problems or troubles,’’said one
black hourly-paid employee of
Davidson College.

Several other members of the
custodial staff and grounds
crew complain that they are
discouraged by their super-
visors from speaking with

my ‘super (supervisor) don’t
find out,’’ remarked one em-
ployee.

“But usually, I just don’t go
see them (Meetze and Stephen-
son).

“If it’s a really pressing
problem, though, I might give
them (Meetze and Stephenson) a
phone call at their home after
work. Just so the super don’t
find out, we will talk,’’ con-
tinued that employee:

This employee’s statement
was verified by an ad-
ministrative official who
preferred to remain anonymous.-

“I know by personal ex-
perience that employees are in-
timidated sometimes for one
reason or another by one or two
of the supervisors,”’ said the ad-
ministrative official.

“They (the hourly-paid em-
ployees) have called me at
home at night about matters as
uncontroversial as explaining a
certain benefit or asking why a
pay check failed toreach them.

“‘When an employee like this

“It makes you. wonder how
many other unresolved matters
that the employees need help or
guidance on go _ unattended,
because the employees won’t
come to me and talk,”’ said the
administrator.

According to another ad-
ministrator, ‘‘People don’t
mind complaininge The em-
ployees come in and complain
tous and to the supervisors.

‘‘T believe the morale among
the workers themselves and
between them and their super-
visors is very high.

“I attribute this to the fact
that when there’s a job to be
done, like the work done this
past weekend to get ready for
the alumni, we all pitch in and
help.”’

Meetze addressed himself to
the various comments that ap-
peared in the April 17 issue. of

The Davidsonian article,
“College pays workers poverty
wages.”
