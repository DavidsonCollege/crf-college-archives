Christian, Antonelli, and Fischer earn physics honor

By CuHap FoGLEMAN

Davidson Physics Professor
Wolfgang Christian and two se-
nior physics majors, Andy
Antonelli and Susan Fischer, were
recently named winners in Com-
puters in Physics magazine’s an-
nual software contest for their pack-
age, “Wave Equations and Other
PDEs” (partial differential equa-
tions). The contest recognizes in-
novative software in physics edu-
cation.

“Wave Equations and Other
PDEs” contains over 150 exercises
designed to aid upper-level phys-

_ Thrower and Sargent met to
discuss the parking problem of
parking during game nights and
decided to send a letter to students
similar to the one students received.

Thrower says he told Sargent
that he could ask students to move
their cars voluntarily, but Thrower
did not authorize Sargent to con-
vert the Baker lot into a staff lot, as
Sargent said in the letter. Thrower
did nat see the letter before it was
distributed.

Sargent says, “I didn’t mean it
[the, letter] to be,a threat. It is a
whole lot better to cooperate than
do this.”

Sargent says he meant to ex-
press that making Baker a staff lot
was an “option for the ’95-’96 aca-
demic year for the Athletic De-
partment.”

Concerning the possibility of
Baker’s conversion into a staff lot
this year, Thrower said, “It’s going
to stay an open lot. There’s no
need to go to a specific grouping.”

Of Baker becoming a re-
stricted lotnext year, Thrower says,
“I’m still not convinced it’s the
way to go....I don’t see any reason
to change it...I’m just not for it.”

Thrower and Sargent had
originally agreed that if students

did not cooperate the status of the
lot would be evaluated at the end of
this semester.

Because students have been
cooperative, both agree there will
be no need to change the status of
the lot.

A student suggested to Sargent
that a shuttle system would go a
long way in reconciling with dis-
gruntled students and be a conve-
nience for students with a long
walk from satellite to their dorms
before the games and then back out
to satellite.

Sargent promised to be wait-
ing in the satellite parking lot at
five o’clock on Tuesday for stu-
dents who wanted a ride back to
their dorms.

graphically such events as “the flow
of particles or energy ... and the
propagation of sound, light, and
water waves.” The software pro-
vides a “palette of options,” rang-

which the user can introduce into
the situation. The resulting wave
can then be analyzed in both time
and space.

The package is part of the
CUPS (Consortium for Upper-
Level Physics Software) series, an
international effort to generate a
group of software which encom-
passes a wide spectrum of physics

topics. “Wave Equations and Other
PDEs” was designed to be user-
friendly, a trait which Computers
in Physics cites as a strength of the
Davidson trio’s package. The
magazine says, “[The program] is
easy to use, colorful, and instruc-
tive ... It should become an essen-
tial component in upper-division
physics courses.” -

Antonelli, who assisted
Christian in designing exercises
and programming, emphasizes,
“We’re not inventing any new
physics; we’re trying to make this
useful.”

collaborative faculty-student ef-
fort. Christian insists that its suc-
cess owes much to Antonelli and
to Fischer, who tested the program
and helped write the accompany-

ing operations manual. Because of
student input, Christian says, “I
think it’s a much better piece of
software than if I’d just sat down
and written it myself.”

SGA resolution makes records public

By Mary CLare JALONICK

Students who wonder what is
going on in the SGA can now sat-
isfy their curiosity in while pro-
crastinating in the library. The SGA
passed a resolution Tuesday to pro-

vide a public record of all student
government proceedings.

The resolution states: “The
absence of easily-accessible
records of SGA proceedings con-

‘tributes to insufficient communi-

cation between the senate and stu-
dents, [and] such a deficiency of

communication contributes to a
lack of accountability of senators
to those represented.” Senior Sena-
tor Chad Lloyd saw an easy solu-
tion to the problem and created a
notebook to be placed in the front
lobby of the library.

The notebook will contain

copies of minutes and financial
documents.

The SGA also passed a “Stu-
dent Government Association Ac-
countability Act.” This resolution,
also created by Lloyd, calls for
publications of roll call votes as
well.
