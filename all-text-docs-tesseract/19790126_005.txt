Glory on the Davidson Football field
is hard to come by. Pro quarterbacks, in
the meantime, have salaries exceeding
that of American presidents. Football is
no longer an expression of rivalry among
colleges, but a billion dollar business.

Textbooks on industrial organization
now include a chapter on football as an
industry. Americans had rather turn
their television knobs to a pro football
game than a wholesome Jolin Wayne
movie. I often wonder, too idealistically
perhaps, if the American conscience is
warped.

At Davidson, football is at least kept
in the proper perspective. The time-worn
cliche about student athletes is still
applicable.

They come. because they enjoyed
football in high shcool and want to
continue playing. They also want a
superior education.

Two of last year’s captains, Chip
Howell and Cliff.Hester, are examples of
this ideal. They both played for four
exasperating seasons, but both agree
that their time was well spent.

Chip is now in medical school, Cliff in
law school. Their potential as contribu-
tors to society upon completion of their
education is incredible.

Fran Tarkenton, an admirable indivi-
dual and fine athlete, has retired his jer-
sey as a football player. He spent Super
Sunday in the sound booth at the Orange
Bowl as an NBC announcer. "

Fran joked that he never thought he
would make it into the locker room of a
winning Super Bowl team, having lost a
few himself as Minnesota's quarterback.
What a way to end a fabulous profes-
sional career! I thought Tarkenton was
wasting his time.

Next year Davidson may be six and
four at season’s end. The Cats’ record
may be three and seven. Win or lose, I
don’t much care.

I’d rather see Davidson get creamed
by the cadets at the Citadel any day than
watch the Super Bowl.

Then again, I hope the Atlanta
Falcons never go any further than they
did this season, ’cause I just may have
to eat-my words.

While many Davidson football fans
want to axe Cartmill and replace Coach
Ferrell, one must admit that Davidson
football is played the way the sport
ought to be. The only big reward the
players receive is the knowledge that
they have done their best.

When my folks came to visit in
November, the highlight of their trip
was.the Davidson-Lafayette game. The
contest reminded them of college football
the way it was in their school days.

My mother, who went to the Universi-
ty of Georgia, said that Davidson played
just like the Bull Dogs used to. The

point is that anybody who doesn’t like _

Davidson football just because the Cats
do net) make it to the Gator Bowl is
insane. oa

The National Football League cham-
pionship game, billed as Super Sunday,
is an affair people should worry about.
Authorities estimate that over $100
million in illegal betting changed hands
over the Super Bowl. Who ever heard of
betting on a Davidson football game?

Campus-wide survey .indicates misconceptions about the Equal Rights

Amendment

ERA. will promote , not impede , equality

Pam Camerra

“The ERA is an attack on holy
scriptures, the family unit, the marriage
relationship, parental duties and rights,
the roles God has given men and women
and the right to be a.woman! ERA will
not give a woman dignity... Her faith in
GOD does that! (From a cartoon booklet
published by Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagle
Forum.)

“All the ERA seeks to do is to say.to

the Supreme Court of the United States
— ‘Wake Up! This the the 20th Century.
Before it is over, judge women as
individual human beings."’’ (Congress-
woman Martha Griffiths, principal spon-
sor of the ERA, Congressional Record,
October 6, 1971, H 92644)

Though the North Carolina legislature
rejected the Equal Rights Amendment
in 1977, the issue will be thrashed out
again in the current legislative session.
Girding for the fight, ERA supporters
and opponents are bombarding the state
with propaganda, pro and con.

Some opponents have misinformed the
public and played upon old-fashioned
prejudices in an effort to cloud the issue
and gain support. Mixed-up notions of
the ERA abound.

Davidson students don’t have their

ERA facts straight either. A recent
campus survey revealed these miscon-
ceptions.
§The ERA is unnecessary because laws’
such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
the Equal Employment Opportunities
Act [EEOA] of 1972 provide for equality
of pay and employment for both sexes. .

Despite these laws, discrimination

against women is still prevalent. The,

Senate Judiciary Committee found that
many women with a four year college

education were, for example, earning |

only slightly more than males with an
eighth grade education.

Discrimination persists even in the
enlightened circles of higher education.
A proportionally larger number of men
are accepted to graduate school despite

Watchman
We were disappointed this week to
find that no professors seemed willing
to write the ‘‘Watchman’s” critique of

last week’s paper.

the fact that women have higher GPA’s.
Men also receive more. financial aid and
higher grants than women. Even women
professors earn, on the average, $3,000
less than their male counterparts. ;
§Women's rights are already protected
under the Fourteenth Amendment which
guarantees all persons equal protection
under the law. ,

The courts have been unreliable in
interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment
to include women. In all cases save one,
(Reed v. Reed, 1071) the Supreme Court

For example, the high court ‘in 1977
barred a young.» woman from attending
an all-male public high school for
advanced students in Philadelphia.

Nor are men getting equal protection

‘under this amendment. In 1973, in the

case of Kahn v. Shevin for example, the
Supreme Court let stand a Florida law
allowing property tax exemptions to
widows, but not to widowers.

_ §My principal objection to ERA is that I
_am simply unwilling to give the federal

government such power.

Section 2 of the ERA says that “‘the
Congress shall have the power to
enforce, by appropriaté legislation, the
provisions of this article.’”’ Stop-ERA
leader. Phyllis Schlafly points to this
clause as proof that the ERA is a
‘gigantic grab for power by the federal
government.” Na

Actually, Section 2 is a rather
standard enacting clause similar to
sections in the 13th, 18th, 19th, 23rd,
24th and 25th amendments. ,

States are not foreclosed from passing
and enforcing their own anti-discrimina-
tion measures. Manyétates have already
enacted their own equal rights amend-
ment. he

Nor will the ERA-prohibit the right of

states to separate the two sexes under.

certain circumstances {ié. restrooms,
cohabitation of unmarried persons). —
§I don’t want my wife and mother forced
to serve in the military.

First, America’s military services
today are all volunteer. If you want to
join, you can; if you don’t, you don't.

Second, if the draft were ever reesta-
blished women would be subject to the
same exemptions and deferments as
men. Women who are married, support-
ing dependents, employed in preferred
occupations (public-officials, health and

safety officials, etc.), conscientious ob-
jectors, or entitled to student deferments
would be granted a delayed classification

.or exempted altogether from serving.

Clearly, mothers will not be torn from
their family and children to serve in
combat.

§The passage of the ERA will deprive
women of alimony and custody rights.

The ERA is designed to end many of
Alimony payments, for example, are
deductible by the paying husband. and
taxable to the wife which often leads to
an uneven distribution of the financial
responsibility. Under the ERA, the duty
of support and custody of children would
be based on the earnings and economic
circumstances, and not on the sex, of the
§The ERA would weaken a man’s obli-
gation to support the family and would
therefore aid in the destruction of the
family. All women will be forced to work
because they will be equally responsible
for the family.

With the passage of the ERA no
woman will be forced to leave the home.
In fact, the ERA recognizes the unique
contribution of the home-maker. The
Senate Judiciary Report stated, ‘Where
one spouse is the primary wage earner
and the other runs the home, the wage
earner would have a duty:to support the
spouse who stays home in compensation
for the performance of his or her duties.’’

The ERA will not instantly change
attitudes. However, it will require that
the legal and constitutional rights and
opportunities and obligations of both
men and women be based on individual
characteristics, circumstances -and
needs.

Equal rights threaten no one. The
ERA will benefit both men and women

“and-preserve the guarantees of the

ERA before it can become part of the

Constitution. Let's hope North Carolina
is one of those three. ieee Me ee
