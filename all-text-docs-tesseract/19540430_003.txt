FRIDAY, APRIL 90, 1984

After waiting patient-
ly for the past few
weeks, the Davidso-
nian Is finally able to
announce that the in-
ter-fraternity tennis

crowned (see elsewhere
on this page for de-
tails). But in spite of).
the fact that the win-
ners have defeated all
ten of their opponents,
many of the Greek
duos have played less
than five matches.
There has been no
great pressure put on
them to hurry the match play, and: matches have been run
off very slowly. A day-by-day schedule was set up originally,
but it has not been followed too closely this year, and as a
result, play is far behind schedule. Even though the champion
has been determined, the lower positions in the league are
still undecided and may remain that way.

After looking closely at the inter-fraternity tennis situa-
tion this year, we feel that the time has come for a change
in the way in which the competition is held. It seems that the
present method has lost out in the hurried schedule of the
individual players since it requires a large amount of time
over several weeks, and most boys don’t have the time to
put into the games. A precise, direct procedure for deciding
the standings is a need which cannot be overlooked if inter-
fraternity tennis is to continue to hold a prominent place in
the annual fight for the Greek Cup. Certainly, the confused,
long drawn-out play cannot continue much longer.

We would like to propose that next year’s tennis play be
held in the form of a tournament similar to the Southern
Conference’s net meet, The success of the inter-fraternity
wrestling meet, which is run on a similar basis, shows that
student interest in a short meet would be much greater than
it is in the present set-up. An annual tennis tournament has
all the possibilities of being a huge success. Though the de-
tails would have to be worked out by the inter-fraternity
representatives, a simple procedure would be to have the
tournament last three days, and to have a single elimination
type of meet. Each fraternity would enter three men, and
points would be given for each‘player advancing to the semi-
finals, and more points if he reaches the finals. The champion
singles player would, of course, gain the most points for his
fraternity, but the results of all three players’ matches would
be important. The tournament would have to be held when
the varsity tennis team was away on a trip, but this would not
be a problem. Also, there are certainly enough courts to have
a tournament run off quickly and without delay, if it is
efficiently handled by those in charge.

Inter-fraternity tennis could really be a big thing at
Davidson, and as in the wrestling competition, could be the
beginning for future varsity material. The way the matches
are strung out now, none of the players can be observed
closely by Coach McKee or other members of the athletic
staff. Certainly, a change is needed. We hope it will come
next year.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

New Wildcat Captains
Elected For Next Year

varsity teams for next fall and winter “have selected their
captains for 1954-55. All the captains are rising Seniors who

Wildcats Are Favorites

By BUNNY PERKINSON

Next week, the sports spotlight of the Southern Confer-
ence shines onthe Davidson campus where the annual South-
ern tennis tournament will take place. All the schools in the
league, with the exception of Washington and Lee (due to

leadership that the honor requires.

The football team, which begins
practice for the 1954 season on
September 1, has picked guard
Dickie Davis as captain for the
grid squad, and halfback Jimmy
Thacker has been elected to serve
as alternate captain. Coach Dole
has expressed high confidence in
both boys, and they have the con-
fidence of their teammates as well
as the coaching staff. In addition
to having the fight that goes to
make up a ball player, both Davis
and Thacker have been real hust-
ters in the Wildcat line-up in the
past.

Davis, one of the boys who found
it easiest to switch to the one-
platoon system last year, is already
pegged as All-State and All-Con-
ference material. He is one of the
finest linemen to wear the Red
and Black in recent years, and his
steady, slashing play is really
superb. He was selected on many
All-Opponent teams last fall, and
if the Cats’ record had been bet-
ter, he would probably have been
All-Conference. Succeeding Ben
Craig as leader of the gridders,
Davis should hit his peak next fall.

Jim Thacker, next year’s co-cap-
tain in football, has been David-
son’s leading scoring threat for the
past two seasons. When he was but
a sophomore, he was selected on
the All-State team as one of the
two offensive halfbacks. Thacker’s
speed and ability to shift direction
quickly have made him a constant
threat to Wildcat foes, and next
fall will undoubtedly see the
familiar No. 22 streaking across
the double lines more than once.

Charlie Parker’s 1954 wrestling
squad has selected Johnny Buxton
as head man for the grapplers for
the second straight season. Buxton
was captain of the Wildcat matters
for the past season, and in being
elected for a second straight time,
Johnny became the first Davidson
wrestler since 1935 to have such
an honor. Buxton will be the back-
bone of next year’s squad, which
will be stronger in number than
this year’s team. Though several
valuable men will be lost via grad-
uation, the fine freshman team of
last season is ready to take up the
slack.

The swimming team has elected
Al Ormond as their captain for
next séason. Ormond has been the
leading Davidson swimmer for the
past two seasons and was the lead-
ing scorer on the squad last sea-

|son. Al has been the chiéf threat

for Davidson in the Southern Con-
ference swimming competition,
and next year promises an improve-
ment in past-records.

Next season, as has been the
policy in recent years, Coach Danny
Miller’s basketball team will have
no permanent captain. A different
captain will be selected from the
varsity line-up for each game.

CAT LINKSTERS
TO MEET WOFFORD

Coach Elgin White's varsity golf
team meets Wofford in Charlotte
next Monday in a match that
closes out the regular season for
the Wildcat links squad. The Da-
vidson crew has met the Terriers
once before this season, and they
soundly defeated _ the Wofford
team in the match.

The golfers had two matches
this past week. N. C. State played
the part of a rude host on Tuesday,
as the Wolfpack edged the visiting
Cats to the tune of 23-22. Then
yesterday, the linksters were
scheduled to meet VMI. This after-
noon, the Wildcats were to be at

VPI.

SPEs New Champions
In Greek Softball

In a full week of hot competi-
tion, the SPEs have emerged as the
champions of the Inter-Fraternity
softball league. Yesterday’s games
determined the championship as
the SPEs won from the Kappa Sigs,
and the Pikas beat the Phi Gams.
The Phi Gams had previously lost
only one as had the SPEs, and a
tle appeared to be in the making
until the Pikas edged the Phi
Gams artd moved into seeond place
ahead of the Fijis.

Good Record

The SPEs finished the season
with a nine won, one lost record.
An upset at the hands of the Pi
Kapps was the only mark on the
otherwise perfect record. The Phi
Gams and the Pikas will battle it
out for second place, though if
both of these clubs lose their final
game, the Phi Delts or Betas could
finish in a tie for the runner-up
spot with the other two clubs.
One more game remains for every
club except the SPEs, who have 2 a
bye for the last round.

Below are the standings of the
softball league, including yester-
day’s games. Three games have
been postponed and will be played
next week.

Wildcats To Hit Cadets
On Diamond Tomorrow

Coach Chuck Clements’ baseballers hit The Citadel to-
mororw in the second half of a two-game series. After meet-
ing the Bulldogs here this afternoon in a Southern Conference
encounter, the Wildcats play host to the visitors again at 2:00
p.m. The Cadets, prior to this afternoon’s contest, were lead-

ing the Southern Conference,
to Davidson.

Next week, Davidson's nine will
have three contests. On Tuesday,
the Cats are at home for a double-
header against Furman'’s Purple
Hurricane. Furman handed the
Davidson club its only conference
defeat earlier this season, and the
Hurricane will be favored to re-
peat the job.

On next Friday, the Wildcats
travel to VPI in Blacksburg, Va.,
for another family encounter, and
on Saturday, Davidson closes out
the 1954 season at Lexington, Va.,
against VMI, also a conference
opponent.

Davidson played only one game
during the past week, and in that
encounter, the Guilford Quakers
beat the Cats, 65. The Davidson
defensive game fell apart, and the
Quakers scored several unearned
runs in the ragged contest.

exams), will be entered in the competition.

Back in 1950, before the old
Southern Conference split to form
the Atlantic Coast Conference,
and the present Southern Conf
ence, Davidson won the tennis
championship, something rather in-
frequent in recent years. Bo Rod-
dey won the singles crown and
teamed with Whit Cobb to win the
doubles championship.

This year, Coach Dick McKee's
team is favored to make, a repeat
performance of 1950. On Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday, the play will
take place, with the champions
being decided on Saturday. Draw-
ings for positions -in the tourna-
ment will take place in Johnston
Gymnasium next Wednesday night.

McKee has received entries from
West Virginia University, William
and Mary, VMI, and Richmond, and
a total of nine teams is expected.
The tournament promises to be
an exciting one from the begin-
ning, and a lot of good tennis is in
store for spectators.

Lacy Keesler, Davidson's No. 1
singles man, will be among the
top-seeded players in the tourna-
ment and could possibly be the
choice for the favorite. Keesler has
been Davidson's outstanding per-
former this season, and his con-
sistent play has made him one of
the most respected players in the
conference. If past performances
mean anything, Lacy will make the
going rought for tournament oppo-
nents.

Thus far this season, Davidson
has played only -one conference
match. The Cats met William and
Mary last week and won an easy
decision. Since then, the Indians
have defeated several conference
foes, and this makes Davidson's
chances look better than ever. A
match with Furman is scheduled
before the tournament, and this is
the last one for the Cats this sea-

WILDCAT CINDERMEN

HIT WEL TOMORROW

BY JOHN HOLSHOUSER

The Davidson track team has two
encounters remaining before the
Southern Conference meet at
Blacksburg, Virginia, on May 14
and 15. Tomorrow they tangle with
Washington and Lee at Lexington,
Virginia, and on May 8, they meet
N.C. State in Raleigh.

While Furman was getting 49%
points the Wildcats piled up 744%
points to defeat the Purple Hurri-
canes in a meet held here on April
28. ,

Phil Koonce was again the high
point man as he collected 16%
points, winning the broad jump
with a leap of 21 feet 2 inches, the
100-yard dash in 9:9.5, and the 220-
yard dash in 23.1. The mile relay
was forfeited by Furman.

Harley Smith kept his pace in
the javelin throw, taking it with
a throw of .172 feet. Tim Gilley
took the discus with a good throw
of 137 feet, 3 inches.

The freshmen tracksters defeated
the Lenoir Rhyne varsity in a prac-
tice meet here April 23, 81 to 49.
The score was comparatively close
until the late stages of the meet,
when Davidson pulled away with
victories in the hurdles and two-
mile run. Tying for top scoring
honors were Don Campbell, Bill
Gramley, and Pete Ashcraft, each
taking two first places for 10
points. Ashcraft turned in a very
good time in the mile, running it
in 4:39.

Six freshmen will be making the
trip to the Southern Conference
meet on the 14 and 15. They are
Bill Gramley, Pete Ashcraft, Ros-
well Mallory, Bill Lazenby, Don
Campbell, and John Robison.

Sigma Delta Psi tryouts will be
held next week, beginning Monday.
Ali men interested in trying out
for the national athletic fraternity
should note the requirements for
membership posted on the track
bulletin board in the varsity dress-
ing room. Contestants will have
all week to pass the required
events.
