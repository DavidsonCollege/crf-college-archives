The Davidsonian

Coach Eddie rolls

As the leaves begin to turn
and basketball season rapidly
approaches, meny on the
Davidson College pus turn
to new head coach Eddie Bie-
denbech. The former All-ACC
guard and assistant coach of the
N.C. State Wolfpack hes not
only brought life to a sagging
Davidson program, but also a
1961 Rolls Royce.

February 1979 will mark the
completion of Biedenbach’s sec-
ond year as owner of the car.
Previously the 1961 Silver
Cloud Rolls was driven by -a
friend of Biedenbach’s from
Greensboro, who hed used the
car strictly for travel in Europe.

Although the Silver Cloud
was not his first choice of
models (he preferred a grey
model), Biedenbach bought the
car because it appeared to be in
excellent condition and was a
great bargain.

Initially his acquisition of the

Rolls was solely intended to be -

an investment. However, Bic-
denbach quickly became at-.
tached to the car. For the
moment, he has given up ser-
ious thoughts of selling the
Sitver Cloud; nonetheless, he
will listen to offers from all
prospective buyers.
Not only has Biedenbach
‘enjoyed driving his Rolls, he
has also enjoyed discussing it.
He explained that many people
ask questions about the car,
and this serves an excellent
social purpose in that it often
creates conversation.
___ One may wonder if owning

What would Socrates
think of O’Keefe?

if you question long enough and deep enough, certain truths about

ft has a hearty, full-bodied flavor. It is smooth and easy going down.
And, the quality of its head is fact rather than philosophical

yecture.
‘We think there's one truth about O'Keefe that Socrates would not
question: /t's too good togalp. As any rational man can taste.

such a fine car has any major
drawbacks. After talking to
Biedenbach there appear to be
relatively few. problems in its
operation. 4

Although the nearest Rolls

Royce dealership ie in High
Point, N.C., the coach says this‘
really is not a problem because

tendants waiting on the car.

According to Biedenbach, many
attendants are excited about

_ working on the Rolls, and often’:
refuse to charge him for their —

services.

A qnestion that often con-
fronte Biedenbach involves the
effects of the Silver Cloud in
recruiting. He feels the car is by
no means a epecific weapon in
recruiting e player, alth
can be an advantage.

In the words of Biedenbach,
“All the little things add up in
recruiting, and this is just one
of the little things. You heed
more than a car to impress a
recruit.””

It appeared obvious that
Eddie Biedenbach really enjoys
his 1961 Silver Cloud Rolls and
the many advantages it creates
for him. However, he handles
the discussion of his car in a
classy manner.

If you’re passing by Johnston
Gym some day and see the
Silver Cloud parked nearby,
stop and take a look. If you
have any questions, go by the
coach's office. He would wel-
come your visit.

Most of the display items are
temple records and are not rare
or of high value. These records
are quite common because each
temple sacrifice for over two
thousand years was recorded by
an official scribe.

No two records are the same,
either, as each scribe had a
unique seal stamped or rolled
into each clay tablet. The
records are as clear today as
when they were made, for the
clay tablets, unlike manu-
scripta, are virtually indestruc-
tible.

Temple records comprise only
a portion of the exhibit. Conical
clay objects inscribed with pra-
yers, known as prayer cones,
were inserted into wet temple
mortar for good luck.

Other tablets contain refer- .
ences to the deity Ishtar and the
Gilgamesh epic. ..-—--- - -:

The exhibit will soon. return

‘to the rear of a Chambers

classroom under the care of the
history department. Beaty sol-
icits any ideas for library dis-
plays.
