Trustees Accept Group's Recommendations

By Bruce Balestier

The Davidson College Board
of Trustees voted Thursday to
accept the recommendations of the
Presidential Working Group on
Athletics. Davidson PresidentJohn
Kuykendall created the Working
Group in the spring of last year in
order to help determine the best
course for the future of athletics at
Davidson. The Working Group
consists of Vice President for In-
stitutional Advancement Osborne
Bethea, Jr., students Laura Cun-
ningham, Sterling Freeman and
Bryson Moore, Director of Athlet-
ics’ Terry Holland, professors
Thomas Kazee, Zoran Kuzma-
novich and Ralph Levering, Fac-
ulty Representative to the NCAA
J.B. Stroud, Interim Dean of

Admissions and Financial Aid
Homer Sutton, Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert Sut-
ton, Dean of Students Will Terry
and Vice President for Academic
Affairs and Dean of the Faculty
Robert Williams. In April of 1991,
the group’ began meeting. They
utilized information ‘from ten Di-
vision land ten Division III schools,
detailed information on Davidson’s
athletic program and surveys of
students and student-athletes, and
issued their report in March. Their
recommendations are as follows:

“1. Current Davidson aca-
demic standards for athletes should
be maintained, regardless of the
level at which the College chooses
to compete or the teams it chooses
to sponsor.

2. The share of the College
budget allocated: to athletics is
substantial and should not be in-
creased.

-3. The College should fund
athletic scholarships equivalent to
the number now provided for in
the Educational and General
Budget. Any additional scholar-
ships should be funded entirely
from Wildcat Club contributions.

4. The distribution of athlet-
ics scholarships should be deter-
mined by the Director of Athletics.

5. Davidson’s athletics teams
must be competitive while main-
taining academic standards and
cost efficiency.

6. Beginning in the fall of the
1994-95 academic year, the Work-
ing Group on Athletics should

report biennially to the President
on the status of the College athlet-
ics program, with specific refer-
ence to the academic, fiscal, and
competitive standards detailed in
these recommendations.

7. Upon receipt of each bien-
nial report, the President should
ascertain whether our current ath-
letics program is meeting the stan-
dards stated above. Ifitis not, he or
she should make changes, includ-
ing but not limited to changes in
divisional affiliation, conference
affiliation, and program support,
which would bring the program
into congruence with these prin-
ciples.

8. The College-should adopt
anew Statement on Athletics Pol-
icy.”

’ The really critical segment of
the Working Group’s Report is
that pertaining to college funding
for athletics (#2). Presently, athlet-
ics comprises 9.6% of the College
budget. The Working Group’ srec-
ommendation legislates that the
percentage be lowered to 9.4% in
1992-93 andagain to 9.2% in 1993-
94. In addition, it mandates that
any overrun be subtracted from the
next year’s budget. Rightnow, that
makes the Athletic Departmentthe
only department of the college with
a financial penalty for overspend-
ing the budget.

According to Athletic Direc-
tor Terry Holland, even the figure

By Chris Hood

For head coach Caroline Price,

the Big South women’s tennis
championships, held April 16-18
at Davidson, represented a final
examaftera grueling year of study.

“We had learned our lessons,

fine-tuned them, and improved for

179 days,” sheexplained, “andnow

it was time for our final exam, a

three-day run for.the roses.”
Riding the confidence of a four-

match winning streak and a 16-5

regular season record, Price and

assistantcoach Bryce Plott’s squad
had been preparing for a conquest

at the Covington courts.

Though they were unable to

repeat as champions in their final
year in the Big South, the ‘Cats
battled from behind to give

Campbell a hearty struggle before
falling 73-70 to the Camels.

Davidson finished 13 pointsahead

of third-place finishers Radfordand
Winthrop.

On Thursday, the ‘Cats played
as expected, capturing all six
singles and three doubles matches.
Davidson found itself tied with

‘Campbell, which had also swept ©

through the first day of play.
Friday’s.action proved to be the
difference in the ‘Cats quest to
repeat as conference champions.
Winthrop’s Carolina Freitas topped
Cyndi Hess 7-6, 6-2 in No. 1
singles, and Coastal Carolina’s Tito
Cabrales bested Natasha Ruth 6-2,
4-6, 6-2 in No. 3 singles. In both

matches, Davidson’s netters were »

seeded second while their oppo-

hents were ranked third.

“Freitas and Cabrales raised their
level of play on Friday; as a result,
we stumbled eversoslightly,”’Price
said of the semi-final round. -

Heading into Saturday’s cham-
pionship round, Davidson found
itself six points behind Campbell.
In order.to surpass the Camels, the
‘Cats knew they would havetonail
down all nine matches and receive
help from some lower seeds, such.

‘as Freitas and Cabrales.

- Inan outstanding display of de-
termination.and control, the ‘Cats
took each of their matches. Per-
haps the signature match of the day
was Kimberly Nance’s 2-6, 7-5, 6-
4 victory over Campbell’s Diana
