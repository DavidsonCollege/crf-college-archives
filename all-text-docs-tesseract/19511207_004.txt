Electrician Russell
Trouble Shooter

There has been a good bit of
confusion in the dorms when hall
lights and bathroom lights are
burned out or when fuses are
blown on certain halls,

Bill Russell, the student elec-
trician, is in charge of these mat-
ters and makes his check once a
week. However, sometimes situa-
tions arise when a fuse must be
replaced or a burned out switch
must be changed. If these emer-
gencies do arise, Bill will be glad
to fix these matters if they are re-
ported to him at 234 Duke, or a
telephone call will suffice.

In the past many students have
thought that the student electrician
furnishes students with light bulbs,
but this is incorrect. Each student is
responsible for the lights in, his
,own room.

record which has been equaled by
very few teams at any time. ‘
Altogether, I feel that the game

coaches, and to the college, and
that it was worthy of the finest
athletic traditions of Davidson.

It clipped his legs right out from

But only No. 3 allowed the medics
to reach him. The unauthorized or-

Back behind the lines the fourth

miracle of a blood transfusion. Or
four of them, to be more exact.
“We had been called off the line
once before to give blood when
it was needed badly, but you can’t
quiet understand its importance un-
til you receive some. You mention
blood transfusion to a student here
and it has no real significance or
meaning. But wait ‘till you receive
it once—then they will never have
to give you a donor pep talk.”

imaginable and I also firmly doubt
that one could be found that would

agree to enter Davidson.

The picture of ODK members
working out football cheers besides
being slightly laughable is far from
the realm of sentiment moulding.
I also find it difficult to imagine
ODK members placing trash cans
in various parts of the campus.

As for abolishing the Court of
Control, etc., I think you would be
doing the incoming freshmen of
future years a great injustice. The
court has put a stop to more serious
practices and also serves as an ef-
fective indoctrination body. By
ending the Court the door to se-
tious hazing would be left wide
open.

It seems to me that instead of
acting as a body for the direct
initiation of action, ODK should
integrate and appraise the various
activities of the college. It should
serve as a critical body that ex-
amines the purposes and accom-
plishments of various organizations
with a view to suggesting better
methods or with a view to spread-
ing the efforts toward a goal among

‘many agencies.

Proposal number 6 in the pro-
gram seems to be the ideal of what
ODK is suited for. A critical
analysis of the student govern-
ment, honor system and student
body regulations is recommended.
This analysis along with sugges-
tions for changes should be sub-
mitted to the Student Council which
can act on them as seems fit.

Situations which need the coop-
eration of all ur several organiza-
tions can be handled through ODK

and in this way duplication and.

conflicts can be eliminated.

I believe that ODK -as a sepa-
rate body should not take part in
campus activities. I feel that this
would cause duplication, since there
are organizations on the campus
which can handle all activities, And
as an integrating body it will be
more effective.

Whichever program ODK de-
cides to initiate will not overshadow
the more important fact that an
awareness of the great potentialities
of the organization has finally been
reached. This is a definite step for-
ward and if it is not allowed to die
on the vine it could be one of the
most important happenings in the
life of the college for a long time.

to prospective, believe a successful
season might follow. A good indi-
cation of the team potentialities will
be evidenced by the outcome of to-
morrow night’s clash with the
hardened Tar Heel aggregate. Last
year the Cats won a decisive vic-
tory over UNC, the only win of the
19S1 campaign.

CABBAGE PLANTER ...
(Continued From Page Two)

Christmas tree lights come in
bunches of thirty-two, which, when
unraveled and laid lengthwise on
the living room floor, become four
Strings of eight sockets apiece. The
bulbs that break while in storage
are green and blue, while the re-
placements, in a brown paper bag
behind the kitchen stove, are white,
with art occasional burnt-out red
one.

A socio-historical note mightn’t
be out of order. Home life was
happier before electricity? Why
was home life happier before elec-
tricity? Home life was happier be-
fore electricity because our fore-
fathers used candles on the trees,
the trees always burned down, no
one had to finish trimming the tree,
everyone got to bed earlier on
Christmas Eve, and consequently
everyone was happier not only on
Christmas Day put throughout the
year.

When the trimmer has placed the
lights symmetrically on branches,
with another dexterous movement
of the lips, he finds that there is
no wall socket at the top of the
tree where the plug is and ar-
ranges them again, this time from
the top down, blue and green al-
ternating for three feet and giving
way to a solid streak of white
lights toward the hase

Just after the ladder has been
folded and taken out to the garage,
the silver star or angel, according
to the trimmer's taste, is found and
must be put on top of the tree. The
average trimmer will argue that it
looks just as good on the mantle-
piece, but will be outvoted by his
wife and children, causing another
trip through the snow for the lad-
der and subsequent mud on the
rug. ,

White the star is being placed, it
is the children’s cue to run over,
shake the ladder with Daddy on
top and beg for permission to hang
tinsel. This, Daddy grants, and goes
upstairs to wrap presents. When
he wakes up three hours later, the
children are in bed and his wife is
standing by the tree, idly reposition-
ing some of the tinsel, all of which
has been hung on the firescreen,

the couch, the floor and the bottom

three branches.

Together they wonder if it’s
worth it, agree that it is, and seven
hours later have finally lain down
for a well-deserved hour and a
half of sleep, When the house is
quiet and the family sleeps, the
children dream of Christmas Day;
their parents, eight hours sleep on
Christmas night.

push which was so successful last

Monday. .

Last week the YMCA cabinet
met and discussed plans for doing
away with automatic membership,
and despite opposition from certain
quarters in the administration, it is
seriously considering the idea as a
working beginning of a revitalized
YMCA. Here again, the organiza-
tion directly concerned is about
three jumps ahead of Robinson,
in that it has already “taken a long
look at its own set-up with special
reference to compulsory member-
ship,” without the assistance of
Omicron Delta Kappa, or of Bryan
Robinson in the capaciy of presi-
dent of that organization.

The fourth instance concerns the
point on entertaining the Baker
scholars. Last spring the prospec-
ive Baker scholars were entertained
effectively and more than adequate-
ly by those gentlemen most quali-
fied to do so—our own Baker
scholars, and for ODK to usurp
their job seems absurd, besides be-
ing impolite.

Mr. Robinson’s last glaring faux
pas was the simple process of mak-
iag mountains out of mole hills, In
the matter of student parking, the
solution is simple: park in the
spaces provided between fraternity
court and Richardson field. It won't

The whole problem of school
epirit, sportemanship, pep, etc.,
could be alleviated amazingly
by a few victories in our major
intercollegiate sports schedules.
In three words — win ball
games!

The only good this writer has
been able to envision in Mr. Rob-
inson’s program when taken as a
whole, is that by the use of the
shock treatment he has cleaned out
cobwebs in the minds of many of
the students. More threats to write
letters to the Davidsonian have been
heard since the publication of the
article than ever before, which is
a good sign, for the average stu-
dent seldom wakes up to the every-
day issues which confront him.

In closing his article, Mr. Robin-
son asked for suggestions, so my
advice is to carry out point 12 in
his program, get a few more waste
cans for Davidson, and cram the
rest of his program as he, has
eather muddily envisioned it into
the most convenient one. Then take
out a new sheet of paper, and with
the members of ODK as an ad-
visory committee and sounding
board, plan a well organized,
original, more conservative and
more practical program for an
active ODK and a better Davidson
before presenting it to the public.
