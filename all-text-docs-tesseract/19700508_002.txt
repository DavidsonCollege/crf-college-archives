A Time To Act

Now is the time for all good. men
to come to the aid of their country.
It is the time that we, as an academic
community, make it clear to the ad-
ministration, of this nation. that the
continuation:of the policies evident in
events of the past weeks“will not be
tolerated.

INDOCHINA

As much as it hurts to say’so, the
war in Vietnam has become the war
in Southeast Asia. We feel betrayed.
The war has entered a new phase of
escalation, allegedly temporary, which
promises to spread violence and kill-
ing far beyond their original unac
ceptable bounds.

Nixon tells us that this latest move
of escalation will actually help shor-
ten the war, but we remain skeptical
of that evaluation. The time has come
when it is better to stop thinking that
he must know what is best because
he is our president. The time has come
to say that the government is sus-
pected of less than that sane conduct
with regard to the nation and, the
world.

We remain suspect of a government
that cotld deny involvement in Laos
even as a secret war was being waged
in that area.

We remain suspect of a military
that could accept a horror such as
that of My Lai until exposed.

We remain suspect of an adminis-
tration which would expand an un-
popular war even to the point of in-
vading a neutral country without its
knowledge. :

Finally we remain suspect of a
President who bases: his claims to
power on the existence of that ‘“mid-
dle America,” those “forgotten Ameri-
cans,”’ or that “silent majority” which
could not even. give the President
half of the votes in the last election.

KENT STATE

We indeed face extraordinary prob-
lems, and our approach to these prob-
lems must likewise be-extraordinary.
It is not enough to sit in front of the
tube and complain or to grumble as
we read the front pages of our news-
papers. No, we must make’vour dis-
pleasure and concern heard.

Nixon and his henchman, Spiro Ag-
new, have too long been allowed to
judge the nation’s mood by what they
are able to concoct out of the silence
of their great majority.

Yet in parallel with opinions ex-
pressed from on high there has been
running a nationwide current of re-
pression maintained by petty and
militaristic attitudes on the local
levels of society.

This repression surfaced most dra-
matically during the police riots of
the 1968 Chicago convention. These
attitudes surface every time that
American honkies applaud. Agnew’s
remarks about effete intellectuals,
freedom of the press, or liberal col-
lege admissions policies.

Most recently, however, they sur-
faced with the, senseless -and inex-
cusable killing of four college students
at Kent State University in Ohio.

We all know what happened, and
on the basis of available information
there-seems—to- have been no_justi-
fication for the actions of those Ohio
national guardsmen involved. But
even more serious questions lurk be-
hind the slayings.

These students were seriously and

conscientiously questioning the Presi-
dent’s actions in Cambodia’s situation.
Are we to assume that this right of
protest is no longer available to them
or to us?

After the tragedy President Nixon
remarked that the incident should
point out the danger of violence in
protests. But we ask, on whose side
was the violence?

The lessons to be learned from
the incident do not concern: violent
protest. Not at all. Rather they con-
cern the danger in a nation’s too long
ignoring morality in international
and domestic dealings. They concern
the danger in acting to prolong na-
tional suffering by expanding the
very cause of that suffering. And they
concern the danger of a President
who ignores. honest opinions by dis-
Pee them as the work of ‘‘college
bums.”

DAVIDSON

If anything, the events at Kent
State should unite the students and
indeed the entire academic commun-
ity of the U.S. in an effort to show
the President that the opinions held
by those at Kent State are not iso-
lated viewpoints. ae

But how is the President to be
made to realize that fact? Our SGA
is sending a resolution of support to
the students at Kent State and for
that they are to be commended.
There is talk of a telegram to Nixon.
But such efforts are not enough.
Nixon apparently will not listen to
reason.

The October and November Mora-
tofium observances were two of the
largest expressions of opinion, if not
the largest, to be presented to Nixon
since he took office. But all through
the events we heard from the White
House only that. Nixon would not be
influenced by such things. We shouted
then; perhaps we need to shout loud-
er.

Courses of effective action do seem
to be open. First is the sort of ‘“‘middle-
class’ protest organized by professors
Gaige, Jackson,*:and Kaylor. On a
wide enough scale such a move pill
scare Nixon into change. That action-.,
and similar actions deserve unquali- &,
fied support.

Ultimately this sort.of action will
be the most effective that could be
taken. But it can receive and must
receive activist support from the stu-
dents of this college.

The ROTC demonstrations on Tues-
day seemed to be an encouraging
sign that students are concerned

enough to commit themselves com- ~-

pletely. It seems highly incongruous
that students should allow support
for the military to continue while
the military seems to be bent on
screwing our lives by its actions in
Southeast Asia.

ROTC is not the real enemy, how-
ever, and it must be made clear that
such actions do not represent idle
efforts at violence. They must be pre-
sented to the people of this area as
sincere efforts of protest.

For: it is ultimately with Nixon’s
own silent majority that the battle »
must be fought. It is with the stip-
port of the voters that Nixon’s plans
will be-changed. For that change-is
the ultimate and final goal.

The Nixon administration must not
be allowed further to perpetrate in-
justice in the guise of publicly sup-
ported policy.

A Time To Teach

The Teach-In on the ecological crisis
has come and gone, having promised
much and produced little. The fail-
ure of the TeachIn to come up to its

expectations can in no way be: blamed

on the organizing committee which
did yeomen duty in setting the pro-
gram up. Rather-it rests with the
student body, which did not support
the effort with anything like. the
enthusiasm necessary for success.
Yet, the problems of our environ-
ment become more pressing every
day, regardless of the international
| situation. They will confront us for
years to come, beifig, in. all prab-
ability, the most important problems
to confront us forthe rest of this

To the Editor:

In early January a

to talk with some of them
of the students told
me that H. Edmunds White
had advised him that he
probably would be happier
at some place other than
Davidson, and I asked him
to write me if he were re
jected.

I quote the first paragraph
of his recent letter to me:
“We were right, man! They
didn't accept me to David

thought my mother was go-

with Davidson after they
sent Calvin Murphy to. in

“When I told Dad, he re-
membered my conversation
with H. Edmunds White and
gave me a lecture on’ how
to eat shit in order to event
ually dish it out. I could
hardly keep from bursting
out laughing.”

The student had the fol-
lowing qualifications: SAT
Verbal of 621, SAT Math of
620, English achievement of
726, math achievement of
625, Spanish achievement of
431 (after one year of Span-

He told me_ that . his
recommendations probably
were not good, and that his

not conform to his high
school's notions of proper

To the Editor:

Although Im not a mem-
ber of the Ad Hoc Commit-
tee for the Protection of
Students, I feel impelled td
reply to the fatuous argu-
ment constructed by Tom
Rogers which attempted to
impugn the motives and ac-
tions of the committee.

Because Rogers’  state-
ment doesn't seem buttress-
ed by any.sort of consistent
logic, it is difficult to criti-
cize his analysis of the com-
mittee’s intent. But I think
a few of the unconscionable
fallacies can-be noted.

In the first place, Rogers
assumes that the decisions
maae by the CR€ (or the
Admissions Committee, et
al.) are, in a sense, beyond
human judgment. Given the
naturé of the political pro-
cess at this school, that
opinion, I supppse, .is fair:
ly prevalent and certainly
orthodox, but to me it seems
profoundly antidemocratic.. «

For as long as legitimacy
and authority are defined
exclusively in terms of fac-

ulty and administrative
committees (with an oc-
casional superfluous thrust
from the SGA on the

periphery of significance),
students will continue to
experience the. sterile ethos
of Davidson: an_ environ-
ment characterized by
apathy, frenetic excursions
into trivia, and a_ general

‘sense of impotence.

What seems to me most
worthwhile about the Ad
Hoc Committee is that it
is pursuing its own form of
legitimacy, defining its own
source of authority, creat-
ing its own sense of power,

What I particularly resent
is the casual manner in
which Rogers bandies about
“responsible’’ and “‘irrespon
sible.’ The values he im-
putes to these words are in-
sipid and morally worthless.

So, toward a_ redefinition
of irresponsibility: the first
level of irresponsibility is
occupied by those who ar-
rogate power without
understanding’ the nature of
its implications, and who in-
voke the titular ‘‘commit-
tee’ to presume. authority.

Manning a lower level are
those who boast the  pre-
ténse of authority without
its substance, exercising
their claim in _ pointless
forms.

But the lowest and
culpable level of irrespon-
sibility is reserved for those
who unflinchingly accept
the bombast promulgated
from above, questioning not
the source of decision and
deriding those who do.

SER,

All Of Us Bums

Dear Mr. President,

HOS Deegan:

CU ca PEE

Remember your Pentagon visit last week where

you said:

“You know, you see these bums, you know, blow-
ing up the campuses. Listen, the boys on the college
campuses today are the luckiest people in the world—
going to the greatest universities — and here they
are burning up the books, storming around about
this issue, - mean — you name it. Get rid of the war
and there’ll be another one.”

Well, you know, you see these
bums, you know, glossing over the
issues. Listen, thé boys in the aa-
ministration today are the trickiest
people in the world — running the
home of the brave and the land of
the free — and-here they are grip-
ing about dissent, I mean — you

name it. Get rid of the war and

there’H be another one.

ROWLAND

Why not get rid oi this war and
let us have something less tragic to storm, about?

You went on to say, ‘‘And out there we got kids
who are just- doing their duty, and I’ve seen them;
they stand tall and they’re proud.”

Proud of what? Proud of supporting the Thieu
government which just decided to let his most out-
spoken political opponent out of prison? Proud of
supporting that government which just closed its
colleges and universities indefinitely to avoid the em-

barrassment of dissent?

Proud of neat things napalm and our other fire-
works can do? Proud of what My Lai did for all those
gooks — er..uh.. that is, suspected VC men, women

and children?
Proud of what?

To make matters worse your effetely snobbish
colleague went on television Sunday and paraphased
you saying that protestors are ‘‘simply using this as a
vehicle to continue their antisocial, outrageous con-
duct, and I think when the war is over they’ll find
something else to use as an excuse... .”

Mr. Agnew went on to say that a man wHose
house is on fire does not whisper réquests for water,
but yells “Fire” and added that he was yelling ‘Fire’,
where he saw fit. He also said that those who dissent
should be violently ‘put down.” .

The National Guard saw fit to put down a few of
the bums Monday scoring four dead. a dozen wounded,
a closed university, and a shocked nation

To borrow the Vice-President’s metaphor, it seems
he may have contributed to arson by adding his flame

to the situation.

Not to be outdone you, Mr. President, came
through with a statement about violence inviting
tragedy despite the paucity of reliable (i.e. not con-
tradictory) reports of the incident.

All this, sir, brings me to the point of my letter.
Back when you were running for office you were
fond of quoting Abe Lincoln. ‘

__ | just wanted to remind you of something Abe
said which you may have forgotten:

“To sin by silence when they should protest makes

cowards of men.”
