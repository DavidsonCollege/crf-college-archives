| Memo to: Doughboys

From: John Siman

Next week we may not have space
for your column. We will be running
a complete paper on an inside tip that

we got that Sam Spencer bought a

controlling interest in Red ‘Clay Brick
Co. over the summer. They are the
brick company supplying’ the Col-
lege. But if the tip turns out to be
wrong, we will just put out adozen or ©
so blank pages—maybe one of those _

_ Stupid cartoons. Either way the paper

will comé out late.

Dear DB & SS,
_ Stay loose. .

The SGA Phonathon started this
week. The goal is $2.5 million in 3

‘nights. Said Ken Krieg, “It is a very

realizable goal. Using our Double
Matching Quadruple the Dollar triple
the Gift Alumni Contribution, we
plan to exceed the limit. If we.don’t _-
reach it though it’s all Christian’s
fault.”

Finally, there will be a party spon-
sored by the Doughboys and Slim-
shafts for all transfer students living
in Irwin 204 and their roommates to-

. morrow night at midnight in one of

our rooms. See ya.
