GOP Wins

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

The pressing financial needs of
the North Carolina Republican
Party and the increasing hope
for its success in the 1968 elec-
tion were the themes of the
speaker at the Young Republi-
cans Club meeting Wednesday
night.

The Hon. Sherman T. Rock,
Carteret County District Attor-
ney, is a Goldwater Republican.
He has high hopes for the suc-
cess of the Republicans in the
near future on both the state and
national level.

Rock pointed out that those
who oppose the strong central. ,
government, the activists. are’
now beginning to get through to!
the people.

“According to a recent poll.”

FOCUS ON CONSERVATISM
Dr. Eugene F. Mitler Examines Types

FOUR TYPES

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer

The question ‘‘What is Con-
servatism?” was brought more
clearly into focus by Tuesday's
chapel speaker. Dr. Eugene F.
Miller.

Sponsored by the Conservative
Club. Miller, assistant profes-

+ sor of political science at Fur-

man University and a member
of the Davidson College faculty
in 1962-63, posed the question as
a prerequisite to anyone who
wishes to participate in the lib-
eral-conservative debate.

“To be seriously interested in
conservatism,”’ Miller contend-
ed, “is to undertake a search
among man’s alternatives for
political understanding."

Using equality as the guiding
principle of liberalism, Miller
divided liberal policies into poli-
tical, economic, social and for-
eign policy spheres.

The conservative movement
emerged in its rejection of
equality as a desirable political

mankind is a more nvble pas-
sion than love of one’s country.”
This passion leads, he continued,
to the attempt to make all na-
tions democracies.

Ultimately, this causes the
creation of a world state and the
redistribution of wealth. This
view of foreign policy is also
rejected by the conservative ele-
ments, |

“What do conservatives stand
for positively?” Miller then
asked. The answer he gave was
that conservative factions have
been unable to agree on specific
principles. He then turned to a
consideration of the four prin-
cipal conservative camps.

Open ‘til 12:30 a.m.

The states’ rights camp head-
ed by newspaper columnist
James Jackson Kilpatrick was
cited by him as resting upon a
strict interpretation of the na-
tional constitution.

The traditionalists exemplified
by editor Russell Kirk take Ed-
mund Burke's idea of accepting
the accumulated wisdom of the
past as the basis of their stance.

The term ‘‘economic conserva-
tives’’ was applied by Miller to
the group which considers itself
in the classical] Mberal tradition
of Adam Smith.

The final strain of conserva-
tism was classified by Miller as
“philosophical conservatism.”

Monday—Friday

Miller Defines Conservatism

‘This group, he said, has begun
with a diagnosis of the crisis in
Western Civilization as due to
the failure of liberalism.

This development in the West,
he continued. has led to a kind
of “relative determinism” in
which all goals appear to be of
equal worth.

said Rock, “there are now seven
timies more people who oppose
a strong central government |
than 10 years ago.” '
‘According to Rock, the most
important job of the state party
is to generate enthusiasm on all
levels and worry afterwards
about the ideology that develops. '

Rock. who described himself
as a ‘‘Yankee Republican named
Sherman,” complained about the|
lackadaisical attitude of the Re-
publicans in this state toward
the financial needs of the state
organization.

He cited as an example of this
attitude the fact that the state
organization did not give John
Shallcross ‘‘a single dime” in
his campaign for U. S. Senator.

His answers to this situation
include the establishment of a
“plush” party office in Raleigh.
the hiring of a public relations
man and an executive secretary
to make speeches and to run the
organization and the raising of
$250.000 from party members to |
support the state candidates in
the 1968 election.

Exam Change Petition
Lacks Student Signers

A petition to have the ROTC
examination changed from Jan.
26 to Jan. 20 will probably fall
short of its goal due to a lack of
student interest. -

Sophomore Jeff Pflugner, the
author of the petition, said that
as of Wednesday only eight of
the 15 petitions being circulated
among the student body had
been received.

“With less than half of the
students involved in the pro-
gram signing, I don't see how
Col. (Frederick B.) Outlaw could
even consider making the
change.’ said Pflugner.

“This petition was started
mainly to see if student opinion
carried any weight,” he con-
tinued. ‘In the past it has not
and now it looks like there is not

leven any opinion.”

Our 55th Year

ae

At Ford Motor Company we're always looking
for better ideas. But not with a crystal ball.

We do it with background and brain.

We do it by seeking answers for down-to-
earth questions such as: Should a profitable central
city dealership be relocated to a growing suburban
location? What's the sales potential for a new
personal car?

And we do it by trying to solve problems that
haven't been faced till now. Problems such as: Is an
electric car the answer to city traffic? How will
people travel in the year 2000?

in short, our better ideas come from better
people. And we take extra steps to get them. Ford

IT’S A NORTH WIND THAT BLOWS NO GOOD

Crushed between the twin millstones of January
weather and final exams, you are saved from total des-
pair, poor devils, only by the knowledge that winter vaca-
tion will soon be here.

Where will you go this year? Will it be Florida again,
or are you tired of jails? Then how about Puerto Rico?

A most excellent notion, say I. A balmy and bounteous
island with long white beaches and blue, blue skies and
green, healing seas. And, most pleasant of all, the warm
and gracious people of Puerto Rico! You don’t even have
to know Spanish to communicate with this friendly folk.
Just learn three simple phrases and you'll get along
splendidly: “Buenos dias” which means “Good morning,”
“Gracias” which means “Thank you,” and “Que serd
seré” which means “Your llama is on my foot.”

In order to help you enjoy the fabled land of Puerto
Rico it would be well for me to supply a bit of historical
background. (It would also be well for me to say a few
words about Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades be-
cause the makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel
Blades pay me to write this column and they are inclined
to sulk if I omit to mention their product. Of course, they
don’t stay gleomy long, for they are kindly, cheery men
fond of Morris dancing, spelling bees, and temperance
punch—fine, upright types, as true and gleaming and
durable as the blades they make. And if you've tried
Personna’s, you know how true and gleaming and durable
that is! And if you haven't tried Personna’s, poor devil,
you've cheated both your purse and face, for Personna’s
last and last, shave after luxury shave, close, clean, nick-_
less, hackless, tugless, gougeless, scratchless, matchless.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades come in Double
Edge or Injector style and are made only by the makers
of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades.)

But I digress. Back to the history of Puerto Rico. The
island was discovered by that popular discoverer Chris-
topher Columbus. Incidentally, considering Columbus’
popularity, it’s odd we know so little about him. What do
we really know? Only this:

He was born in Genoa on August 25, 1451, the son of
Ralph T. Columbus, a knee-cymbal vendor, and Eleanor
(Swifty) Columbus, a low hurdler. He was an only child
except for his five brothers and eight sisters. From early
childhood he was an avid reader and spent all his waking
hours immersed in a book. Unfortunately, there was only
one book in Genoa at the time—Care of the Horse by
Aristotle—and after 18 years of reading Care of the
Horse, Columbus grew restless. When rumor reached
him there was another book in Madrid, off he ran as fast
as his little fat legs would carry him.

Disappointment, alas, awaited him there. The only book
in Madrid was Cuidar un Caballo, which proved to be noth-
ing more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.

Then one day Columbus heard from a traveller that
there were millions of books in India, and he was in-
stantly ablaze to set sail. Off he ran on his little fat legs
to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella (Columbus, though
more than six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs
all his life) and, as we all know, he persuaded the Span-
ish rulers to outfit him with three stout ships, the Flopsy,
the Mopsy, and the Cottontail, and the rest is history!

Well sir, now you know all about the origins of Puerto
Rico. So get packed and get going! You'll love it! Stroll the
beaches, swim the coves, breathe the fragrance of hibiscus
and bougainvillea. Andremember always that the friendly
Puerto Ricans are delighted to show you their customs,
teach you their language. Why, I'll wager you'll soon know
far more Spanish than the three basic phrases. You'll know
“Hastala vista” which means “See you later.” “Por fdévor’’
which means “Please,” and “El tren se paré en las esta-
cién” which means “Your llama has eaten my passport.”
