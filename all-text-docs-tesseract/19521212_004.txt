A post-mortem on
the weeks-old football
season may‘ not make
the most exciting read-
ing, but it seems to this
reporter that some
words are in order on
the accomplishments
and failings of the °52
Wildcat gridders.

Ac first glance the
most obvious — short-
coming of Coach Bill
Dole’s team would seem
simply that they didn’t
win but two games.
However, when you
look at the handicaps
_under which the Cats
labored this year—small squad, rough schedule, injuries. etc.—
that record doesn't look so bad. If nothing else, it was an im-
provement on the 1951 record of 1-8.

On the credit side of the ledger there are a lot of things to
enter, most notably the fact that the ‘52 Cats were a team with
more hustle and spirit than has been seen around Richardson
Field for some years. They fought hard against overwhelming
odds (e.g., the Harvard game) and managed to look like a team
most of the season even with many key men out with injuries.

The biggest single factor in making Davidson football
what it was in 1952 was undisputedly the Wildcats’ head coach.
Bill Dole. The boys who played for him will be the first ones
to tell you that. Dole inspired confidence in his team and showed
them how to play football so that they as well as the fans could
get a kick out of the game.

With a squad cut down to less than thirty men at the
end of the season by injuries and sickness. Dole juggled players
and kept his team going. Without his skill at moving his men
around (and their willing compliance with his wishes). the Cats
would hardly have won the Richmond game and wouldn't bave
held some other opponents to as-low scores as they did.

After the °52 season it appears that Coach Bill Dole will
have a job coaching football at Davidson for a long time—or
as long as he wants to have the job. Davidson is lucky to have
a man of Dole’s caliber as head man in its football program, but
even with the best coach a football team can't win unless it has
material and favorable conditions under which to work.

Dole will not in the near future have much money to work
with. It is possible that he will be able to draw on slightly a
larger fund for scholarships next season, if the Wildcat Club can
kick in a little more. but the Cat headmaster will have to depend
chiefly on his ability to recruit the very best talent he can find
—the kind which can make the grade at Davidson, and will be
willing to come here instead of the bigger schools. That’s no
small feat, but it’s obviously what Dole will have to do to field
winning teams. ,

As far as the more nebulous condition which we mentioned
above—favorable circumstances to work under—is concerned,
Coach Dole is going to have an even harder time in the next few
seasons. Unless some small Southern Conference college can push
through legislation to allow freshmen to play on varsity teams,
Dole will have one more hardship to contend with next season.
(The powers that be at D. C. are opposed to frosh participation
in varsity sports.) Otherwise the situation looks pretty good for
the Wildcat head man. He's been getting a favorable press, his
team likes him, and after his first season the students and faculty
seem to think he's a pretty good guy.

JOE DUDLEY

Joe played well last year and
was first team the majority of
the time. He was second only
to Bill Brooks in total points
with 292 points for a 11.2 aver-
age, but if he coninues the
pace he is setting this year, he
will easily better these old
marke.

The lean Winston-Salem native
was pouring in that push sho:
‘rom all over the court and keeping
the basket about as busy as Old
Glory in a stiff breeze Tuesday
night. Frank Selvy was as hot as
the proverbial firecracker, but be-
fore the game was. over all of the
local attention had shifted from
the potential all-American to Mis-
ter Dudley. The fast and hectic
first half saw Joe put 18 points
through the hoop, and even with
the Furman defense hot after him
in the second, Dudtey: managed. ten

A student manager at State re-
cently refmarked that Joe “is the
thinnest d—— basketball player I
ever saw.” He certainly wasn't far
from wrong for the 6-4 frame car-
fies between 160 and 165 pounds
soaking wet, but Dudley doesn’t
let this hinder his hustle and scrap
especially under the baskets.

Joe’s success in this cage
game is a story in itself which
was reported last year, when
Joe made his first Wildcat of
the week appearance. The
most amazing fact was that Joe
came to college and only con-
sidered coming out for tennis,
which is really his game and
one that he plays with the
same determination as basket.

He decided to try his ability

It will be the first of ten meets
for the Davidsons, who are begin-
ning the season with a new coach,
Carroll Hambright, and with sev.
eral new men in the lineup who are
going to be counted upon heavily
to fill the many places vacated by
last year’s graduation.

Hambright only recently took

over the duties of coaching thel.
but the Catfish have:

been working out for several weeks
under the tutelage of swimming in-
structor Tyke Ellis.

Won Six Last Year
Last season, the second in Wild-
cat intercollegiate swimming his-
tory, saw the Davidson squad win
six meets while losing only four.
Two of the Cat wins came at the

expense of Clemson. .
Davidson will go into Tuesday’:
meet with a definite handicap, hav-
ing practiced only two weeks. Clem-
son’s team will have one match

with South Carolina behind them. |

Hambright said that the Cat's
chief weakness at present was
a lack of sprinters and divers,
and that he would welcome
any new prospects for the squad
in these two departments.

“There are several capable
swimmers who could do us some
good, who are either ‘transfers, or

ineligible’ for other reasons this
season,” Hambright commented
this week.

Among the swimmers now mak-
ing up the team, veterans Jim
Bryan and Al Ormond appear
headed for another’ successful sea-
son. Bryan, a senior, excels in the
backstroke, while Ormond, last sea-
son's high point scorer, is some.
thing of a jack-of-all-trades.

Other returnees from last sea-
son of whom mutch is expected in-
clude Paul Cole, George Crone,
Bob Patten Jim Golding, Bud
Montgomery, John Stiefel, and Ken
Partin.

Among the frosh, Larry Parrot
and P. L, Hicks have been looking
good in practice sessions.

The greatest losses to the Cat.
fish came last year with the grad-
uation of stalwarts Aybrey Miree,
Ken Taylor, and Ed Stuart. Stuart,
a junior, is studying in India this
year, but will probably return to
Davidson by next season.

Groaners In Chapel Hill 3
For Meet With UNC . Today) srs: es

By BILL

Eight Wildcat wrestlers are in
Chapel Hill today for their first
dual meet of the season with the
highly-rated Carolina team. Little
is known about the Tar Heels as
this is their first match of the
year, but pre-season forecasts rate
them as one of the best teams in
the conference.

Coach Charlie Parker wasn't
very optimistic as to the outcome
of the match. Parker's 123 Ib. class
ace, Bobby Joe Key, is ineligible
and won't be able to wrestle until
second semester. Gene Craven,
probably the strongest man on the
team, received a shoulder injury
last week and will be out of action
until after the Christmas holidays.

Coach Parker sald that the weak-
est point of the team was its lack

After Furman Win

By JOHN HANDLEY
Davidson’s scrappy Wildcats will travel over to Durham
next Tuesday to try their luck against Duke's ever-dangerous
Blue Devils. The Dukes, though playing without the services
of their graduated great, Dick Groat, are a fine team and will
be out to better their 1-1 record.

After dropping their first game
to strong Wake Forest, the Blue

Devils outscored Washington and

Lee last Tuesday to even up their
record. The Cats will have to watch
such Blue Devils as Rudy Lacy,
Rudy D'Emilio, and Bill Reigel.
All three of these men played on
Duke’s great team last year. All
three sport averages of over 15
points in their three games to date.

D'Emilio and Reigel both hold
guard positions while Lacy fires
‘em from his center slot. This trio
accounted for 60 of Dake's 91
scored against W&L the other
night.

The Cats will be gunning to
knock off another of the big
conference games as they face
the Blue Devils. Fresh from
their thrilling upset victory
over the highly-touted Furman,
the Wildcats will be seeking
Victory Number Three.
