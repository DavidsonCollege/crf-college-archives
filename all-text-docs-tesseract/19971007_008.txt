8 THE DAVIDSONIAN

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1997

Note to Franklin: Don’t blame the messenger

umes Jefferson Franklin’s

criticism of the

Davidsonian’s “sensa

tional” coverage of the Gist
trial (“Responsible Journalism?”) does
nothing more than attack the messenger
and distract us from the real question at
hand.

For the real issues are not the
Davidsonian’s coverage of, but the
student’s reaction to, the trial. Franklin
would have the com-
munity believe that
we “‘journalists’”” —

‘tion, a selective fascination, with the
results from the Davidsonian’s poll on
the Honor Council. I-became an En-
glish major because I cannot do math,
but here is what the numbers say to me.

From what I understand of statis-
tics, our poll cannot be called biased.
That a third of the student body at-
tended the trial, but half of those polled
attended is perfectly probable. I didn’t
feel comfortable filling out a poll be-
cause I did
not attend
the trial.
Those who

focused our attention
on the trial while ev-
eryone else was looking elsewhere.

So as not to be accused of employ-
ing the same sophistic techniques as
Franklin, I will say up front that any
reference to the Gist trial as an Honor
Code case is a mistake.
argues that this confusion warrants skep-
ticism about the quality of our report-
ing, and I disagree. One mistake, an
understandable one considering the trial
was conducted by the Honor Council,
does not erode Sarah Ogden’s fine re-
porting.

Franklin’s letter reveals a fascina-

did attend
probably
felt more
confident
voicing their opinions than did those
who did not (or could not) attend’ The
dissimilar numbers between the attend-
ees and the polled’ students do not in-
validate the poll, as Franklin asserts.
But more importantly, Franklin
evades the disparate reactions between
those who attended and those who did
not. Of those who attended, nearly 60
percent found their “faith in the Honor
Code and/or Code of Responsibility
lessened.” Only 38 percent of non-
attendees found their faith lessened.
What these numbers suggest to me —

and again I am not very good at math —
is that, if you were at the trial, you very
likely did not like what you saw.

As Franklin seems fond of giving
advice, I assume he doesn’t mind re-
ceiving some: Perhaps the administra-
tion and members of the Honor Coun-
cil, of which Franklin is a member —
which he neglected to mention — need
to fix those elements in the Gist trial
which made 60 percent of the students

enter or were not willing to endure the
uncomfortable conditions. (That is the
reason, by the way, we printed the tran-
script, Franklin’s rhetorical fireworks
notwithstanding.) And as Mike Scarbo
pointed out two weeks ago, 450 of the
500 people who heard Koestner speak
were required to be there. That means
50 of the remaining 1,100 or so people
who had a choice to attend her speech
chose not to.

the amount of coverage devoted to the
Gist trial unwarranted given the other
events of the week.

Specifically, he found our reprint-
ing of the transcript gratuitous, and rec-
ommended that a transcript of Katie
Koestner’s presentation would have
been better placed in that space. Again,
let us return to Franklin’s dear numbers.

A third of the campus attended the
trial, and a third of the campus attended
Koestner’s speech. The 900 Room was
so packed that many people could not

the fact that more people are interested
in a Code of Responsibility case than
Katie Koestner, First Night Down, or
football? Truly, we would be living
down to Franklin’s claim that we were
creating the news had we proceeded in
any other way.

It also seems relevant to point out
that we had to expand our Op-Ed sec-
tion from three to four pages to accom-
modate both the number of submis-
sions concerning the trial and also the
articles on other subjects.

[also disagree that the trial was “a
relatively unimportant subject” simply
because “at no time was anyone ever in
danger of being expelled from school.”
Franklin speaks the truth about the pos-
sible sanction here, but misses the point.

People were interested to see how
Honor Council members handled the
case. What students saw at this open
trial will serve as the basis for their
opinions about how the Honor Council
operates at closed trials.

Every trial is undoubtedly differ-
ent, but presumably many things are
constant from one to the next, and it is
these constants students are interested
in. Because, unfortunately and in all
probability, the Honor Council will de-
cide a future case in which expulsion is
a possible sanction.

Franklin disguises the real issue
— the negative reaction of many stu-
dents to the functioning of the Honor
Council — with angry rhetoric and se-
lective argument.

The: front-page,-and indeed the
entire newspaper, is what we have al-
ways tried to make it: an accurate re-
flection of the most interesting stories
of the week.

Franklin hasn’t convinced me that
the Davidsonian’s coverage of the trial
deviated from that principle in the least.

happen at Court parties over the

years. Bloody brawls, sloppy
hook-ups on the dance floor, people
slipping in the spilled beer and fall-
ing into the muck under the crowd’s
feet — these images have all met my
eyes at one time or another.

However, this weekend I wit-
nessed the last thing I ever expected
to see at a Court party: the hideous
double standard of our society.

For a few years now, the swim-
mers of Davidson have brought it
upon themselves — thank God some-
body has — to cross the line of
radical behavior by disrobing in the
midst of the
crowd to dance
inafrenzy ofraw
energy. As an
amazing display
of athletic con-
ditioning and un-
bridled emotions, the event has be-
come a ritual in some Houses.

Last Saturday night served as
no exception as the crowd onceagain
received a solid dose of men without
shirts, jumping and grinding in time
to the music.

The only difference in the event
came later in the evening when a
young lady, fed up with the heat
inside the House, proceeded to un-
button her shirt in order to cool off.

Her thick, white satin bra re-
vealed no more cleavage than would
a bikini top.

She never removed the shirt
itself. ’'ve seen dresses worn to
church ceremonies that would have
exposed more of her breasts.

Citing the swimmers’ ability to
remove their clothing without draw-
ing admonishment, she felt justified
in her actions.

And why not? After all, we do
live on a liberal arts campus in this
day of supposed sexual equality.

Why can’tmenand women take
off their shirts if the mood strikes? I
thought women were now being
taught the idea of a healthy body
image.

Should we tell women to feel
pride in their bodies, but to never

Double standard is wrong

enjoy it? What’s more enjoyable
than removing a coarse garment
under uncomfortable conditions to
feel the cool drops of rain on your
skin?

In the midst of all this, the
double standard of our society took
the form of a female attendant of the
party. Carrying the stench of stale
beer on her breath, this random fe-
male approached the open-shirted
young woman and began rambling
off reasons why the shirt ought to be
buttoned.

Many of her assertions relied
upon the double standard of divid-
ing the actions of individuals in rela-
tion to sex.

In
other words, if
men want to
take off their -
shirts and
dance around,
that’s all right.

But should a woman do the
same, she should be persecuted for
her attempt to display any model of
equality.

She finished her verbal assault
by stating that the removal of one’s
clothes resulted in imitating the
swimmers, thereby associating one-
self with a group she deemed unac-
ceptable.

I never expected to see a
woman attack another woman for
trying to enter a man’s world.

The double standard which per-
sists in our society is bad enough
when preached from one sex to the
other.

But the acceptance and propa-
gation of that standard within the
sexes would seem to only corrupt
the movement for sexual equality.

Inthis day and age when women
struggle in business, at home, and in
the classroom for a foothold from
which to gain an equal standing
among men, unity would seem para-
mount to success.

But such unity will come at the
cost .of holding our tongues when
individuals’ bold movements vio-
late the morals of the few for the
benefit of the mass.

D really anger people on this cam-

Let me tell you. Do one thing:
Unbutton your white Gap cotton shirt
and expose yourbra. That’s it. Sounds
really simple, doesn’t it?

Come on, you say, the male
swimmers dance topless all the time.
More power to them. It gets hot in
those houses. Ever heard of the Na-
ked 400s? There’s nudity there, too.
And guess what, it’s male nudity.

That was my statement; that was
my experiment. Why don’t women
on this campus enjoy the freedom to
get naked whenever it pleases them?

Here is a conversation that actu-
ally took place:
A woman indignantly ap-

proached me.
“Could you please put your shirt
” she demanded.

Why?” I respond.
No answer.
“What year are you? Are youa

Abercrombie & Fitch outfits, nor do I
support J. Crew.

“Frankly, I don’t see any prob-
lem with what I’m doing,” I said.
“Guys do it all the time. Come on, are
you going to tell the swimmers to put
their shirts on?”

“Yes, and besides I don’t think
you want to be aligned with those
people.”

Great, I was dealing with some-
one who thinks along the lines of “us”
and “those people.” This argument
was obviously a lost cause.

So there I was, innocently mak-
ing my point and in the background
there are occasional hisses of “Slut,”
“Whore,” and “Bitch.”

I find this kind of funny: When I
unbutton my shirt, ama whore.
Meanwhile, those women who

bras. How risque.

Would the world end if
we had some exposed cleav-
age on this campus? Appar-
ently so.

if I get hot or am even just struck by
the urge, I will take it off.”

I know this is Billy Gra-
ham country, but come on. This is
college. We’ re a bunch of crazy teen-
agers and 20-somethings. So let’s
live it up while we still have the
chance.

OK, sol’ ve unbuttoned my shirt.
The world stops, jaws hit the floor,
and women look like I’ve just gone
ahead and slept with their boyfriends,
brothers, and future husbands all at
once.

I’djust like to say: “Chill.” Let’s
try to stop laboring under the juvenile

freshman?”

Now, what does that mean? If I
were a freshman, would I still be
under the impression I was ina fun
and wacky place? Maybe, although
probably not.

“No, actually, I’ma sophomore.”

“Well, ’ma senior, socould you
please put your shirt on.”

If seniority dictates the dress code
around here, I think we’re in big
trouble. Or at least I am because I
don’t own any specially coordinated

home for an entire year. My
boyfriend.
If that makes me a slut, so be it.
“Thou hast a whore’s forehead; thou
refusest to be ashamed” (Jeremiah
3.3).
' That’s right, my friends. There’s
no shame here and I will do it again.
I am a woman. I have breasts.
And ifI get hot or am even just struck
by the urge, I will take it off.
Learn to deal with it. I am al-
lowed my freedom of expression.
And if you don’t like it, don’t
look.
