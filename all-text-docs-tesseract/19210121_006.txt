DR. FRAZER HOOD
RECEIVED AS MEMBER
OF SIGMA UPSILON

The Sigma Upsilon held a meeting last
Wednesday night January 5th in the
Bachelors’ hall. A new member, Dr.
Frazer Hood, was initiated and he pre-
sented a most interesting and well writ-
ten thesis on the Psychology of Judas.
This was followed by a very interesting
paper on certain old Civil War tradi-
tions of Wilmington by Dave Roberts.
The last chapter of a continued novel
was then read by Jap Cummings and the
happy ending of it put everybody in a
good humor to welcome the usual “feed.”

It was decided at this meeting that the
medal, which has heretofore been given
to the man doing the best work for the
magazine, will in the future be awarded,
to the student who presents the best
three articles for that publication each
year.

EUMENEAN SOCIETY HOLDS FIRST
MEETING OF THE NEW YEAR.

Phie Change Night of Meeting to
Thursday.
The meeting of the Phi Socicty Thurs-
day night was full of pep, cold weather,

and frequent bursts of oratory.

Fred Smith, the first man for the

affirmative stated the query as: Resolv-
ed: That in anti-trust legislation labor
unions should be exempt from construc-
tiun as combination in restraint of trade.
The affirmative brought out the points;
that this measure would make the fight
between labor and capital equal in every
respect; that labor unions are absolutely
essential; and that labor is no article of
commerce.
ing speaker for the affirmative.

Dave Roberts was the lead-

With Dunlap leading, the negative

that labor

The decision was unanimous for the

affirmative.

The extemporaneous debate was car-

ried on by two past masters in oratory,
namely: Chalmers Long for the affirma-
tive,
negative. The query was: Resolved, that
women passess a higher degree of ed-
ucability than men.
history of the rise of woman throughout

and J. Fitzhugh Clark for the

Long gave a brief

the last 400 years and proved they had

showed as high a degree of ability as the
best men, Clark based his arguments on

his stated belief that women had not
risen at all in the last 400 years. The
decision was this time unanimous for
the negative.

John Poteat, with his usual flow of
eloquence gave an account of the Hague
conferences. -«

The critic also got very oratorical in
his criticism, but pronounced the whole
meeting a success.

After the various committee reports,
the society adjourned to warmer rooms.

A large attendance marked the first
meeting of the Eumenean Society in the
year nineteen twenty one. This is also
the first meeting at which the members
of the Junior Society have been present
with the society proper.

The subject for debate was somewhat
staggering to the audience. It read as
follows: Resolved, That in anti-trust
legislation labor unions should be ex-
empted from construction as combina-
tions in restraint of trade.

Those on the affirmative were Gamble,
Tucker, and McGukin; those on the
negative, Lowry, Fraser, and Morris.
Three main arguments were presented
by each side. In the case of the affirma-
tive, the entire difference between unions
and trusts, the protéctive nature of
unions, and the necessity of unions were
brought out.

On the other hand: the negative stress-
ed the similarity of unions and trusts in
spirit, dictatorship, and working basis.
The affirmative received the decision.

Gus Summers closed the program with
an interesting oration on “The Advan-
tages and Disadvantages of the Small
College.”

There is that in man, in the meanest
masculine heart, which makes him want
to have faith in the beauty of woman-
kind as he would like to have faith in
God.

SHORT STORY ISSUE
OF MAGAZINE
COMES FROM PRESS

The Christmas issue of the Magazine
came out on the sth of January, but this
was the fault of the printers, for they did
not get it back in time for distribution
before the holidays. This is a short
story issue and contains quite a number
of good articles written by the men on
the campus. The - Magazine contains
only 20 pages, but these are well filled
and nicely arranged.

The editorial management lays the
blame for the small size of the Magazine
to those who can write but will not. It
is impossible to put out a big Magazine
unless the men will write for it.

This issue is divided into three parts:
first, the editorial part, which is follow-
ed by the story section. In the back are
the jokes, which the business manager
has mixed up with his advertisements,
so that the student will read both.

The management requests us to say
that the next issue will probably go to
press by the last of this month. Any-
one who has any contributions for it
will please turn them in at once.

TRY IT.

Dearest—

The love I have expressed to you

Is false and I find my indifference to-
wards you

Increases daily. The more I see you
the more

I dislike you.

I feel myself in every way disposed to

Hate you. I assure you that I never
intended to

Love you. Your last conversation has

By no means

Impressed me with the high standard of
your character.

Your temper would make me entirely
too unhappy,

And if you and I were united I would
expect nothing but the

Hatred of my friends and the everlast-
ing dis-

Pleasure of being with you. I have in-
deed a heart

To bestow, but I do not desire you to
think it

At your service. I could not give it to
any one more

Inconsistent and capricious and be

Capable of doing justice to my family
and myself.

I hope you are aware of the fact that

I speak sincerely and I hope you will do
me the favor of

Keeping away from me in the future and
not

Answering this letter as your letters are
always full of

Tmpudence and have not a shadow of

Wit and good sense. Believe me

T am sorry to say it is impossible for me

To be
Your affectionate sweetheart.

P. SI suppose you were inquisitive and
read all of my letter. I only intended
for you\to read every other line.

KEEP.

Keep to the right as the law directs,
Keep from the world thy friend’s de-
fects;
Keep all thy thoughts on purest thrones,
Keep from thine eyes the motes and
beams;
Keep true thy deed, thy honor bright,
Keep firm thy faith in good and right
Keep free from any sin and stain,
Keep from the ways that give thee pain;
Keep free thy tongue from words of ill,
Keep right thy aim and good thy will;
Keep all thy acts from passion free;
Keep strong in hope, no envy see;
Keep watchful ears o’er tongue and
hand,
Keep free thy feet by justice stand;
Keep true thy word, a sacred thing,
Kcep from. the snares the tempters
bring;
Keep faith with each you call a friend,
Keep full in view the final end;
Keep love between thy God and thee,
Keep from all hate and malice free;
Keep from thy courage bold and strong,
Keep up the right and down the wrong;
Keep well the words of wisdom’s school
Keep warm by night, and by day keep
cool.

A NEW YEAR REFRAIN.

By W. E. R.

The old year may have been a frost,
With loss ahead of gain,

Perhaps you had to pay the cost
And bear another's pain.

But whether good, or whether bad,
Or whether wrong or right,

That’s all behind you now, my lad,
So tighten your belt and fight!

Out in the night the way may lead
Your feet to a murky mire;

But struggle on and keep your speed,
Returning fire for fire.

The past is gone and-can’t come back,
The future glitters light—

So switch onto the open track—
And tighten your belt and fight!

The way was dark, and you lost the
prize,
Though you fought with all your heart;
But he, my boy, was twice your size,
And, too, he had a start!
The New Year says go play the game
With courage, grit, and might.
The fight, old man, will not be tame,
SO TIGHTEN YOUR BELT AND
FIGHT!
--Emory Wheel.
