Smith shared his views about this gift for his
Alma Mater, saying that the idea originated from
his admiration and respect for Rhodes Scholars.
He also recognized that while Davidson did have
a good many scholarships for undergraduate study,
it did not have many for postgraduate study at
international universities.

Smith stated that, “Fifty years ago, when the

told him (Vagt) about my desire to have something
similar to the Rhodes Scholarship at Davidson. I
assumed it would require more than $1 million to
set up such a scholarship.” According to Smith,
Vagt responded by indicating that this amount
would be enough to satisfy the financial
requirements to establish the postgraduate gift.
This was three weeks before the reunion of the
class of 48. “At this moment,” adds Smith, “I felt
sure that there was not enough time to work out the
details before the reunion.” However, Smith said
that Vagt assured him that there was plenty of
time: “As soon as he returned to Davidson the next
day, work began on the details, and it was in order

Dr. Wendy Steiner speaks about the necessity of pornography

By AsHLey E. KiInc
News Editor

In the 900 Room of the College Union on

Wednesday, February 10, Dr. Wendy Steiner,
head of the English department at the University of
Pennsylvania, delivered a controversial speech
entitled “The Necessity of Pornography.” Intro-
duced as “one of the foremost critics in word and
image studies,” Steiner has written several books
in her career as a professor, including The Colors
of Rhetoric and The Scandal of Pleasure.
In her speech, Steiner attempted to prove that
pornography is. an essential aspect of artistic ex-
pression, “My argument is going to be that por-
nography is necessary to art,” Steiner said at the
beginning of her discourse. She later added, “In
many cases, pornography and high art are mere
images of each other.” She then delved into how
several different forms of pornography are related
to more accepted forms of “high art,” asserting
that pornography is necessary to understanding
the entire spectrum of art.

Steiner first compared romantic literature to
literary pornography. According to Steiner, the
romance is linked to the values of a feudalistic
society while pornography is associated with the
values of Western capitalistic society. “Pornog-
raphy is deeply entrenched in the notion of Repub-
licanism,” Steiner said. She supported this claim
by saying that pornography explores the “notion
of interchangeable value.” She explained that just
as one in today’s American society would buy
many different sweaters, wearing one on a certain
day and another on the next, so do the main
characters in pornography go from one partner to
the next. In contrast, the romance examines the
“question of transcendent value” where the setting
up of an ideal” is the focus. Steiner believes that
the popularity of pornography has spread as a
result of 20th century society “when the notion of

absolute values has had a hard time.”

The next portion of Steiner’s speech included
a series of visual images that were meant to chal-
lenge the audience to think about how societies
define pornography. “What we call pornography
is terrifically culturally determined,” Steiner said
as she flashed famous works of art across the
screen. All of these now respected works of art had
once been denouncedas indecent and pornographic.
Pointing to the distinction that many in the art
world make “between the nude and the naked in

_ painting,” Steiner argued that many representa-

tions accepted in art museums would not be ac-
ceptable to people in other settings. “People are
worried about certain kinds of representation,” she
said. To further demonstrate her point, Steiner
quoted Mark Twain who once said of a nude
painting of Venus, “It is a trifle too strong for any
place but a public art gallery.” Steiner felt that
Twain’s ironic comment revealed how pornogra-
phy is defined by culture and not by the actual
content of the visual image.

Continuing with the concept that the obscene
is not a concrete concept but rather an abstract
construction, Steiner referenced many past con-
ceptions of the vulgar that seem ridiculous today.
“A change in norms makes :
the objects that are called
obscene seem foolish,”
Steiner said. For example,
the chair skirts of the Victo-
rian age were invented to
cover the legs of the chair
and thus protect the viewer
from such an inappropriate
sight. She also alluded toan
art show that took place in
Nazi Germany called “‘the
degenerate art exhibition.”
