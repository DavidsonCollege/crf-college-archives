we were allowed to have open politics of a

we could have had the necessary informa-

limited by an undesirable system of “closed
politics.”

POLITICS

The political question opened several
weeks ago will continue to hold a prominent
position on this page. It has not been an-
swered, mainly, as it will take an inesti-
mable time to arrive at a_ satisfactory
answer. Study the question with us, and
let us all arrive at the best answer conceiv-
able after much time, study, and thought.
We do not want to sit back and dream of
ideals fostered in the past—that have failed
—but study the question with an objective
and progressive viewpoint. The following
editorial is being reprinted from a DAVID-
SONIAN file of the past, which proves the

fact that the question has gone for some
time with no action resulting. It most

capably answers all questions concerning
“open” politics to date.

our student body wants to keep those things
out of Davidson, it can. We can open poli-
tics on a basis in keeping with our idéals,
and by doing so can remove the stigma that
now covers our political fate.

Qualifications For Office

In our elections, we-Strive to! select men,
who are qualified for the position they will
be expected ‘to’ fulfill, But at present we
cannot» rightiully chgose men because we

both through our individual conduct and by
selecting leaders who demonstrate qualities

our student? government and upholding our
Honor System, Therefore, we should make
every attempt to insure our position by mak-
ing it possible for our election of- leaders
to be carried out on as sound a basis“as we
can conceive. We want to be able to select
officers ona basis of character, ability and
desire dS shown through past achievement,
and personality, instead of on a basis of
rabble popularity.

Suggested Features For An

Open Political System

hough any single attempt cannot cover
all of the features which we may ‘incorpor-
até in an open political system, a:few ideas
car be crystallized which are indicative of
the plan we would advocate. What we are
endeavoring to achieve is an order wherein
the substantiated knowledge of a group or
individual can be circulated generally. -This

choices that are invariably valid. Jf we ean

totatseit? We have seen already the justi-
fieation of political activity by gri ups small-
er than the whole student body. Party cau-
cuses need not be any more biased than a
prejudiced “Supreme Court.”

Davidson wants and needs a change in her
election rules. It is to our advantage to
work together to achieve a system of open
politics that does not force us into a two-
faced position, but that will really elect the
right man.
