knowledge in itself, but a mere approach to
knowledge, a glimpse into the Elysian fields
of contentment where true education and
culture flourish.

Not until a student has achieved humility
in his own mind does he become a true mem-
ber of Phi Beta Kappa. If he has achieved
the honor through intense study alone, sac-

life to attain the position, he is the pos-

a burning desire to continue onward in his

Guest Columnist:

Your columnist (I said YOUR |
columnist) has gotten tired, tired of
writing about you fellows — prob-
ably as tired of writing as you are
of reading about yourselves. So he
has conceived an idea. Subsidizing,
he says, is the thing of the hour,
whether it be the subsidization of
ball players, musicians, or ghost
writers. For him at the moment the |
question of writers is most pertin- |
ent. Consequently you'll read |
about yourselves this time as seen |

and heard by this snooping stu- |

dent councilman, who takes his|
Heifer Highballs ‘with as good |
spirit as any of you. |
