CAMPUS DANCES

Last week-end saw the first dance set on the Davidson
campus in quite a few years. There have been words. spoken
for and against the move, but no matter what is said, dances
on the campus are probably here ay.

For many students this is the first time there has been little
worry about transportation to and from the dances. The drive
to Charlotte sometjmes made it necessary for several couples to
double up and sometimes even discouraged some boys from
getting dates because of not having rides.

The new Johnston gym is the best auditorium for dances
that we have seen the Pan Hellenic Couneil acquire. The Char-
lotte Armory was the next best thing, but it proved to be too
small for many of the dances. The acoustics in the armory were
better than in.the gym, but the fault there may be in the band—
the sweetest musie this side of Guy Lombardo.

The Morris Field gym was totally inadequate on all the
above counts. It was extremely diffieult for everyone to find
transportation half way to Gastonia. The floor was too small
for Davidson dances, the acousties were terrible, and the place
was a hideous looking old fire trap. Parking at Morris Field
was inadequate and it was like slushing up the Italian Peninsular.
after the usual Davidson rains.

Then, too, we might bring im the Charlotte Hotel ballroom
where everyone found his little square foot of space and did his
dancing (?) right there all night. This really wasn’t too bad
unless your space happened to be too close to the band. Such
poor unfortunates were continually being hit in the head by the
trombones. ;

But the ballroom wasn't so bad when one compares it to
the basement of the Armory. In this dance hall is found about
the same amount of space as in the hotel, but the dancers were
placed on a foot high platform. This actually wasn’t too bad if
you could safely work your way into the center of the throng.
But those on the outside were rhythmically being pushed off
the platform. ,

The power of the whole W. & L. football team on that damp
November day in 1946 failed to cause as many injuries to David-
sonians as did Billy Butterfield, his band, and the Bone’s ele-
vated dance floor.

Dances on the campus also will have certain difficulties,
some of which we will. not discuss. Main argument against the
practice is the difficulty of having a banquet or breakfast dur-
ing the week end. The possibility of having such here on the
campus must be ruled out for the simple reason of lack of facili-
ties. Therefore, to have a banquet the fraternity must revert.
back to the old custom of going to Charlotte. For a breakfast,
it is also necessary to make the trip. However, the administration
has voiced its. disapproval of breakfasts in Charlotte in no um
certain terms.

Banquets or breakfast, the trip must still be made. This
fact poses the same problem of transportation to Charlotte that
existed before—a prime argument for having dances here.

We might at this point inject the fact that very few rooms:
were available on the campus for the past week-end because
homecoming planners above the student !evel secured a major
part of the available space. This was done last summer for the
convenience of alumni who would return to fill the coffers te
overflowing. However, this problem will not exist at other

dance week ends, although there will be many who will have to | ;
find rooms for dates outside of Davidson—more trips to Char- |:

lotte.

will not voice an opinion as to where the Pan-Helenice dances

should be held, but we have presented these few facts, both
pro and con.

EDIT

| In response to the wave of com-
| ments which have swept the cam-
|pus since Dr, Abernathy’s talk in’

chapel Thursday, critically analy-
zing and indicting the extra-cur-
ficular activities on the Davidson
campus, The Davidsonian, in view
of the significance of this talk, is
taking the liberty to reprint the
salient features of Dr. Abernathy’s
criticisms, along with some student
reactions.

In substance, Dr. Abernathy’s
criticisms are as follows:

After-three years of careful ob-

tivities, four conclusions have been
reached: (1) the level of achieve-
ment and quality of resourceful-
ness found in our extra-curricular
activities are inferior to that of
similar activities in first-class high
schools: (2) the leadership of and
the actual participation in extra-
curricular activities is concentrated
in too small a fraction of the
student body; (3) in terms of pro-
gram content, there is almost no
sense of growth or development
in the planning of programs which
appeal to higher Kevels of maturity
and experience; (4) through our
extra-curricular organizations, stu-
dents are learning poor attitudes,
incompetent and inefficient ways
of doing things, and a certain blind-
ness’ toward higher standards and
possibilities. :
Extra.curricular activities do
have a place on a college campus,
when they meet certain reauire-
ments. Those organizations which
provide life-like situations for the
testing of what is learned in the
classroom, which provide: students
with important social skills, and
which, in turn, further motivate
classroom performance, hate the
most obvious justification ih the
college community.
Do our organizations meet these
requirements and fulfill these stan-
dards? The Davidsonian,. for. in-
stance, does not. It would never win
a first-class rating in the National
|High School Press Association con-
test conducted by Columbia Uni-
versity. The actual quality of its
writing is very low, and it has no
consistent editorial policy. Most
of the editors are not performing
the functions of editors; in fact.
they would be hard put to explain
what these functions are. Not one
of them is interested enough in his:
job to buy a book on . journalism
and master some of it. Our editors
don’t have any: real conception of!
what ‘news is, nor how to find it,
nor manufacture it, nor what to do
‘with it when they get it. The stu-
dent body as a whole has failed to
discharge some of its responsibili-
ties. It is hard to have a good col-
lege newspaper unless it has some
readers who are critical and appre-
ciative in their judgments.. The stu-
dents should bring unrelenting
pressure on the editors for a higher
caliber of performance. “Perhaps
you would do better to elect some
students to a general faculty-stu-
deat board of publications which
would appoint the Editor on a
merit basis, from a group of appli-
cants, which would review at regu-
lar intervals both the policy and
performance of the editorial staff.”
There are many other organiza-
tions on the campus which do not
meet the previously stated require-

ON IN

‘a movie. ‘To learn. about interna-
tional relations, a student must stu-
dy. He must read reports of the
Lforeign correspondents in the New
York Times, or the reports of the
‘Foreign Policy Association, or the
magazine, “Foreign Affairs,'’’ or a
solid book or two. Then the stu-
dents will have prepared themselves
for discussions, talks, and. movies.

To mention another group, the
fraternities, also do not fulfill these
requirements. At Davidson, we
have succeeded in eliminating most
of the more obvious abuses of fra-
ternities on. a campus. But, have
our fraternities been any more suc
cessful in justifying their existence
in a community of learning. A fra-
ternity should emphasize the basic
objectives of the institution. The
fraternities should support the edu-
cational program. It should seek
faculty help in establishing pro-
grams to improve study habits,
reading, vocabulary, tutoring, note-
taking, ete., for all the students in
the group who need such help. The
fraternities should single out: some
worthy projects to support.. One
miight get behind a vocational gui-
dance program; another might of-
fer some award in creative writing
or dramatics; another might raise
money to bring a special lecturer
to the’ campus, or back the move-
ment to increase interest in the
arts and music. This sort of thing
might have far-reaching conse~
quences. , ; :

With those thoughts, Dr .Aber-
nathy has presented the Davidson
student body with one of the most
challenging questions ever to come
from the speakers platform in
Chambers Auditorium. For years,
according to Dr. Abernathy, we
have been in a rut as regards our
extra-curricular programs, and have
been content with the status quo.
Actually, we have been retrogress-
ing. People have complimentarily
slapped us on the back, poured gol.
den phrases into our ears, and told
_us that we are impeceable, upstand-
ing, Christian gentlemen. Thus
have we been lured into idle com-
placency. Our inquisitive interest,
youthful drive, and intellectual cu-
roisity have been stunned, and we
have been satisfied with the situa-
ation.

Following are some student and
faculty opinions on Dr. Abernathy's
talk: ;

NEIL LEACH: The well-found-
ed and straight-forward criticisms
of Prof. Abernathy hit a sore spot
in the college curricular. Now that’
our very ability and incentive as en-
lightened students has been attack-
ed so openly, our main defense
should not be in firing back with
remarks .aimed low, but we should
take these words as they were in-
tended and rise out of the “every-
thing’s rosy” attitude with direct
improvements of our own program.
Notice the professor's words close-
ly and you'll see .that they upset
many applecarts. If these various
applecarts are righted and return-
ed to their respective low-class
corners, the professor's words will
have been wasted. We can’t afford
to lie back down. Now that we're
‘awake, let's stay. ;

CURTIS HARPER: Too often
we as students conform so comfor-
tably to the status quo’ and as a
result, a luke-warm attitude tow-'
ard extra-curricular activities is in
teasonable order. The trouble with
Davidson to a great extent has been
to fall in line. too easily and at.
tempt to keep on the campus an
unrealistic fellowship of happiness
and joy, such as does not exist “out
in the world.’’ There is a great need
for well-informed and experiénced
students as well as faculty to stand
before and, if necessary, against the
student body inefforts to awaken
fellow students out of their happy
but impractical dream.

several of his points,

working on the Davidsonian or any
other campus publication, for “that

much time cannot be spent “root-
ing” through journalistic volumes
in the library. Other schools give
credit in journalism or sizeable fi-
nancial help to students who hold
positions on school papers, year-
books; etc. I think that the cam-
pus publications will by necessity
remain on their present level unless
some added incentive is given to
the students working on them.

THAD MONROE: I agree
wholeheartedly with Dr. Aberna-
thy’s views on extra-curricular ac-
tivities’ at Davidson. I think they
could be improved in practically
every phase. And whil¢ we're on
‘the subject of improvement some
mention should be’ given to the
atrocious conduct in chapel during
Dr. Abernathy’s speech. I hope that
this didn’t reflect the attitude of
the student body toward the con-
