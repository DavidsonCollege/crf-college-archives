Redemption. That’s the best word for
it. The Davidson basketball team has re-
deemed the Wildcat fan — a species
which became forlom and disgruntled in
the football season — from a sad state of
athletic apathy.

The Wildcat cagers pounded, annihi-
lated, destroyed, maimed and mauled
East Tennessee and Appalachian State
this past week. There really are not suffi-
cient adjectives.to describe the dominat-
ing aspects of the victories.

And what do these two victories
mean to the downcast gridiron fan? Well,
ETSU ended a .15-game losing streak
when they drubbed the Cats and Appalac-
hian delivered a 63-7 massacre in their

homecoming game. The Wildcat fan was
at a.low ebb. ™

This is not to belittle the football
team; they worked hard and played hard,
but over the long stretch they were out-
manned and outmuscled by scholarship
programs with large proportions of
muscleheads. But the fan doesn’t base his
emotions on things like trying hard; he or
she wants wins. We may be able to ra-
tionally accept the reasons for the losses,
but we are still emotionally numbed by
57-point margins. ;

The emotional numbness and athletic
apathy are over now, thanks to the bas-
ketball squad. The Cats beat ETSU and
Appalachian by a combined margin of 64
points. That, folks, is a drubbing of the
first order. Ain't revenge sweet?

Wednesday night the David-
son wrestling team travelled to
Charleston, South Carolina to
face the Bulldogs of The Citadel.
A Southern Conference pow-
erhouse, The Citadel dominated
most of the meet, winning by a
score of 44-6.

In the first match, freshman
Holme Oltrogge hyperextended
his knee, forcing the Wildcats to
forfeit his match.

Both senior Mike Adams
(126) and freshman Bruce News-
ome (134) were pinned early in
their match.

Sophomore Sherb  Sentell
(167) lost an exhausting match,
16-2, and heavyweight senior
Gary Branch lost a close match,
1-2. .

The Wildcats also forfeited
matches at the 142, 158 and 190-
pound. divisions.

The meet was highlighted by
co-captains senior John T. Lay
and junior Tim Heinze. Lay wres-
tled perhaps the best match of his
season and defeated a tough oppo-
nent 9-2. Heinze sparked excite-
ment in a verbose cadet crowd
with a come-from-behind victory
late in the third period. Heinze
narrowly won by a score of 8-6.

The “Wildcat Ten” have been
plagued by injuries. During the
Virginia Tech match, junior Doug
Bachelor suffered a separated
shoulder that ended his season.
This injury left a hole in the lineup
in the 158-pound class. Also,
Adams is wrestling with,a bad
back, Sentell has a bruised thigh,
and Branch has a chipped baie in
his thumb.

The Washington and Lee Invi-
tational was cancelled this past
weekend and gave the Wildcats
time to recover.

Johnston Gym’s Backrow Bunch —
Emil Cekada, Perry “The Whistler”
Mathewes, Tom Ridenhour, et al. —
often started a chant of “In your face”
after dominant Davidson plays. Al-
though this chant was primarily a re-
sponse to great plays in the game at hand,
it was also a gut-level, emotional re-
sponse to these two schools who had
beeten the Cats so badly on the football
field. Look, the chant was saying, we ac-
cept the fact that you could beat our over-
matched football team, but now that we
have got you on an equal footing, schol-
arship for scholarship, we're pounding
the daylights out of you.

Two visitors from ‘Chapel Hill re-
marked after Saturday’s game that they
could not believe the noise level and

emotional interisity of the Davidson fans.
They said that the atmosphere in the Dean
Dome could not approach it. ‘Well, they
didn’t have to suffer through a football ~
season in which it took both hands to
count the losses. We understand redemp-
tion and revenge here at Davidson.

We've got two more big revenge
games in Johnston Gym. Marshall beat
the Wildcat football team 63-14 and Fur- -
man handed the Cats their worst defeat of
the season, 59-0. Both schools are also at
the top of the basketball standings at the.

Be warned Marshall and Furman. No
matter what happens in your gym, you
still have to come to ours. So far,
payback is hell.
