VA To Deduct for 0

North Carolina veterans who owe
the Government money as the re-
sult of ovérpayments on veterans
benefits may find all or part. of
their share of the forthcoming spe-
cial dividend payment on National
Service Life Insurance deducted
to cover their debts, the Veterans
Administation announced today.

Records of the North Carolina
VA Regional Office here show
that about 7,737 veterans owe the
Government approximately $749,-
000 as a result of overpayments on
subsistence allowances on GI Bill
schooling and training, pension,
compensation, readjustment allow-
ances, and losses made good to
lenders on defaulted GI loans.

Just how much of the total figure
will be collected from dividend de-
ductions cannot be ascertained this
far in advance. The present sched-
ule calls for the first payments
from the $2.8 billion NSLI divi-
dend fund to go into the’ mails
sometime in January 1950 to some
16 million veterans over the nation.
Nationally, some 60,000 veterans
are currently indebted to the VA
for a total of about 70 million dol-
lars, and VA officials in Washing-
ton estimate that between 20 and 30
million dollars of such débts may
be collected from the NSLI divi-
dends.

A considerable number of veter-
ans are: now repaying indebtedness
by having deductions made from
their monthiy checks, Wher the
overpayment is wiped out, as :: may
be by the dividend deductions, there
will be no further monthly with-
holding.

Rejuvenated IRC —
Reveals Policies

Plans for a revised version of
the IRC took definite shape at its
bi-weekly meeting last Tuesday
night which forecasts a bright fu-
ture for coming years. After an
appeal to all old members to lend
their support in building the club
back to its pre-war standards, ac-
tion was taken by those who re.
sponded. All who did not answer the
appeal were dropped from the role.
The members who did show. inter-
est will form the nucleus of a small
dynamic club replacing the large
disinterested forces of recent years.

Actions taken by the ‘club are as
follows: 1. The club menthership
will becomie henorary. 2. Reqiire-
ments for membership will be a
definite interest shown in the affairs.
of the club and a recommendation
from either a present member or
the history, political science, or re-
lated departments. 3. One recom-
mended must pass the approval of
the club. 4. When accepted a new
member must submit a 1000 word.
paper ‘on some subject related to
international relations. 5. Members
missing more than two meetings
a semester without acceptable ex-
cuse will be dropped from the roll.
6. Initiation fee for new members
will include payment for an IRC
key to be worn by all members.
These new rules are not made to
discourage membership but instead
to encourage interest.

A discussion on actual plans fo
the coming year was lead by the
club’s' facuity advisor, Dr. Guerrant
of the political science department.
Programs in which all members
must be informed and will have a
chance to participate are to be
planned. The club will contact the
faculty committee in charge of ac-
quiring guest speakers and create
an interest in their programs, Joint
work with the IRC at Queens and
other schools will be planned. Every
effort possible will be made to raise
the interest in international rela-
tions at Davidson at’ a time in
which this subject should be fore.
most in our thoughts.

Whether Report

By TREW GURLEY, JR. -

A. cold air mass moved across
this area late Thursday night and
brought with it cooler weather. This
frontal system became stagnant just
off the North Carolina coast last
Sunday and this caused rain and
showers most of the week end. A
low pressure area which originated
in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday
moved northward on Monday and
Tuesday to cause more rain on
those days through out most of the
Carolinas. A cold front succeeded
the low on Tuesday.

|
Today, Wednesday, the cold air

brought fair skies and fall like tem-
peratures. Another cold outbreak
of air is expressed to move into
this area on Thursday or Friday
and bring a continuation of fair
cool weather.

just. a reminder of the full har.
vest moon expected this Saturday
night and to the fact that it will
be conducive to a big, open, log
fire, hot coffee, doughnuts, and
plenty of loving.

“Christian Vocation” was the top-
ic of Thursday morning’s service.
“There exist no wide understand-
ing that the Christian vocation, the
call of God, extends to earning a
living and to our political and social
life. Two things have resulted from
this fact. First, Christian faith
hot the supreme power in the life
of the Christian’ which determines
his attitudes and actions. Secondly,
the fact that other motives than
God's. glory have claimed our loy-
alty.

Thursday evening's
veloped around the theme of “Com-
mitting Ourselves.” “No one. sit-
ting in the baleony as a critic can
really live in every relationship: of
life — commital is necessary To
success. The real’ battle today is
for the souls, of men, Causes clash
all about us fighting for our: full
commital, Christian Committal does
not mean we know everything at
once. It means we believe the an-
swer lies in. Christ and that we are
willing to follow him to the end

During the Chapel service today,
Dr. Broyles will discuss “The An-
swer to Communicism” and will
complete the fall services tonight

tanding of physics

Ride Board

Realizing that the Davidson cam-
pus is blessed with an over-abun-
dance of traveling: enthusiasts, the
YMCA has. ‘provided Mimeograph-
ed ride slips to aid: students in ob-
taining transportation to the var-
parts the world. The ride

both wanted and
for rides available, are to be found
at the right-hand corner of the bul-
letin’ board in the north end
Chantbers.

will be of some lielp to the student
body. All suggestions and criticism
will be welcomed.

school while the national average
is only one out of four.

The negative contended that
Davidson is not safe because of
two basic’ factors, The- first was
in regard to the student's character,
wherein it was pointed ‘out that the
Davidson student doesn’t come up
against ‘the same evils here as he
does when confronted with outside
society; an. illustration: “An oak
tree grows by fighting against na-
ture.” The average student does
not suppert the honor system on
the basis of its ethical concepts, but
merely because it has grown to be
an ivy covered tradition and the
studént is told to support it. The
second principle. factor which the
negative brought out was that the
Davidson man is inadequately pre-
pared. to serve in society, since we
have on this campus very few peo-
ple of conflicting ideas which might
serve to- stimulate interest and
thonght in contemporary problems.

With the announcement that this
month is the time in which mem-
bers may compete in the annual
Phi society speaking and writing
for’ which keys will be

far, produce the peace of death. Is
it fanciful to suggest that a dearth

In conclusion, this analysis of
certain salient aspects of Davidson
life is by no means complete. It
does not even attempt an evalua-
tion of its perhaps superficial find-
ings. Many more points of view are
needed before any definite conclu-
sions can be reached, and the writer
would like to. invite. student and
faculty comment on a problem
which demands critiea) and sympa.

self-appraisal can Davidson escape
from. the Lotus-isle of complacen-
cy, and ensure that she shall never

dent of jts own. superiority.
