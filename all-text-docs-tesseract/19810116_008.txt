Wildcats are top of the Conference...

Basketball Nostalgic? Living in 1970

‘ Once upon a time, about ten
years ago, there was a small
college in North Carolina with a
very good basketball team. For
some reason the best coaches
left the warm confines of that
small college for some bigger
schools in the ACC. From then
on the small college team was
not so good, and the coaches
were shuffled in and out. Some

Wildcats wow Conference, fare
poorly in non-Conference games

people said basketball was too
expensive. But then in the
1980-81 season, something hap-
pened...

It started in the mountains of
West Virginia at Marshall Uni-
versity when a miracle from a
higher league, the 3 point field
goal, put a game in overtime.
And that small college, David-
son, upset the hometowners

79-73 in double overtime.

Next a team called the Moc-

casins from Chattanooga, Ten-
nessee. They blew the Mocs
right back home on the choo-
choo to Chatanooga with an
impressive 93-54 win.

After a four-game non-con-
ference suicide squad schedule,
they played Western Carolina,
picked to win the Southern
Conference, in the friendly con-
fines of Johnston Gym. The
Wildcats weren't leading by
much, but then big Cliff Tribus
stole the ball and the show as he
jammed it on a fast break. So
much for the Catamounts, as
Davidson won by 9 points,
77-68.

Davidson wasn’t finished
though. In the last game they
had shown signs of playing
defense, and the fabled giant,
Richie D., was finally playing
near his potential.

Then Marshall came to Dav-
idson. Things fell Davidson’s
way and the Cats couldn’t do
anything wrong in the second
half. Freshman John Gullickson
made an incredible double-
pump reverse layup that caused
the crowd to yell so loud that if
you listen very closely you
might still be able to hear the
echoes. Transfer Tommy Mc-
Connell connected with Jamie
Hall on a perfect alleyoop pass
that was almost as exciting.
Richie DiBenedetto played
great D., and Todd Haynes
scored 19 points as the team
broke the 100 point barrier. But

_best of all, because the team

leads the Southern Conference,
the fans were able to enthusias-
tically chant ‘‘We’re Number
One”’ for the first time in years.

By then Davidson was the
best free-throw shooting team
in the NCAA, andit helped in
their next game. After losing a
15-2 lead against the Mountain-
eers of Appalachian, Davidson
still managed to lead by 3, but
the same miracle from the

higher league that had helped
them before hurt them now, as
the Apps’ Kelvin McMillan
scored from 23 feet with 13
seconds left to tie the game at
57. That meant overtime. 7

Well, it came down to fouling
the best free throw team in the
nation, and the freshman
Gullickson was under a lot of
pressure. He made the shots,
and Davidson won, 66-63. The
fans wiped the sweat from their
brows and cheered the tremen-
dous Wildcat effort.

Todd Haynes leads the team
and the Conference with a 19.2
ppg average, and the team is
still number one in the nation at
the charity stripe. Although the
team is only 7-7 overall, the
conference record is 5-1 on the

season with a big game against
Furman on Saturday. ="

This has been a fairy tale of a
season and a Cinderella team.
As Gullickson put it, ‘I knew
we had an experienced front line
and a young backcourt, but I
wasn’t sure when.we would get
together. We’ve jelled very
early in the season, and I’m a
little surprised at that.’’ For the
first time since the Driesell-
Holland days, this campus is
humming with basketball.

‘“‘We like to think big,”’
continued Gullickson. For now,
big means Southern Conference
champs and a berth in the
NCAA tournament.

Who are these Wildcats? A
team that, with a little luck, can
go a long way.

Although Davidson College granted
its students a break from December 19 to
January 5, the basketball team was
exempted. They lined up against 4 of the
toughest teams in the nation including
two top ten teams. The stiff competition
left the Wildcats on the short end of the
schedule.

While the rest of the school was going
home, the basketballers were heading to
a frigid North, where they opened
against Pennsylvania. The game was
tied after about 2:30 of play, but the

‘ Penn rolled away very quickly, leading
by 14 after 10 minutes and stretching the

_ margin to 20 by the halftime buzzer.
The second half was no different, as
Penn tacked on 12 more points to their
halftime lead to win hands sown, 92-60.
Kenny Wilson, freshman guard, was a
pleasant surprise as he led the Cats with
11 points. He was followed by freshman
John Gullickson, sophomore Cliff Tri-
bus, and junior Rich DiBenedetto, who
each netted 10 points.

Things went better two nights later at
Holy Cross, but the game ended in the
Davidson loss column to drop the team’s

record to 4-5. Gullickson was the big gun
as he pumped in 10 of 16 field goals for
20 points. Todd Haynes chipped in with
13 points in the 96-79 loss.

As the top ten rolled into the tomb
better known as the Charlotte Coliseum,
Wildcat defense continued to be sloppy.
The Deacons of Wake Forest jumped to
a 10 point halftime lead of 36-26.
Davidson’s field goal shooting picked up
in the second half. The Cats lost the
second half by only 3 points, 47-44, but
the 83-70 final score left the team out of
the game.

A lack-luster defense again plagued
the Wildcats as they faced the Irish of
Notre Dame. Although Christmas was
still the season neither the ball nor the
refs gave Davidson any gifts. Many of
the shots just wouldn’t fall, and the
referees let some situations get-out of

hand——failing, for instance, to call a .
_ technical on Irish center Orlando Woll-

ridge’s slam dunk of a dead ball. Kelly
Tripucka, stood out for Notre Dame as
he tallied 21 points, but-Davidson’s
Todd Haynes led all players with 25
points.

With the tough. schedule of the
Christmas season behind, the team
record stood at 4-7.
