STUDENT RESPONSE POOR
Faculty Wants Open House

By PAUL SCHNEIDER
Staff Writer

The Sunday evening Open
House program continues to
receive faculty and adminis-
tration support despite poor
student response.

Two Sundays ago, the last
time the homes were opened,
five faculty and administra-
tion members unanimously
backed the program. Student
attendance that night ranged
from a low of zero to a high
of eight.

“When you meet a great
man it is wise to beat a path
to his door, and I think the
perceptive students will dis-
cover that there are a num-
ber of great men on the Da-
vidson faculty and will beat
a path to their offices, class-
rooms, and homes whenever
they have an opportunity,”
said William Bondurant, as-
sistant to the president.

Several professors thought
that students misjudged fac-
ulty when they stayed away
from homes because of’ fear
of ‘“‘apple-polishing."’ ‘I don't
like to pressure students.”
said Dr. Thomas Pinkerton.
professor of German, ‘‘but 1
am really very much inter.
ested in having students come
into faculty homes.”

There are many, minor
problems for faculty and stu-
dents. Faculty wives are us-
ually unsure as to what prep-
arations to make for refresh-
ments. Students frequently
have difficulty finding trans-
portation to outlying faculty
homes.

Dr. William Frey, assistant
professor of physics, said that
both students who visited his
home were physics majors,
but that he liked it that way
because a common interest
was shared and the small
number enabled the students
to find out more about them-
selves and the professor.

Dr. Max Polley, professor
of religion, has had three
open houses this year, some
by formal announcement and
some with personal invita-
tions to classes. He said, “It
has worked out quite well for
me so far."

Faculty interest is strong.
Most of the professors who
had open houses this past
Sunday also participate ac-
tively in freshmen adviser
capacities in which they at-
tempt to have the students to
their homes. The problem is
student. interest.

“The question I have heen
unable to answer is whether
this is fulfilling any need for

times with the Davidson
Wildcats March 16.

The concert was originally
scheduled for 8 p.m.. but the
Social Council plans to wait
until after tomorrow's Da-
vidson St. John’s basketball
game before making final
arrangements, according to
Chairman Charles Cameron.

Should Davidson win Sat-
urday’s game, the next game
will be the following Satur-
day in Raleigh.

According to Cameron, if
the team makes it to the re-
gional tournament in Ra-
leigh, the Social Council will
make an attempt to re sched-
ule the concert for the after-
noon.

“We just aren’t-sure that
we can get the concert: time
changed," said Cameron,
“but we will do everything
possible to allow all of the
students to attend both the
concert and the tournament.”

If the concert is re-sched
uled, it will probably be mov
ed to 4 p.m., Cameron noted.

The concert will be pre-
sented in Love Auditorium,
and student identification
cards will be checked.

Council Considers

Mundane

By ROBERT PYEATT
Asst. Managing Editor

A lackadaisical Student
Council screened applicants
for SGA courts Tuesday
night in a mundane 45-min-
ute session that ended with
most of the members going
“up the road.”

President Tom Earnhardt
assigned half of the room to
conduct the Court of Appeals
screening and the other half
to the Student Government
Court candidates. Council
members running for SGA
president were permitted to
leave in order to campaign.

Council members express-
ed their individual prefer
encés about each nomince,
crossing various names off
the list and dismissing can
didates they did not know or
did not like.

After about 20 minutes of
weighing qualifications, the
council adjourned and most
of the members said they
were going ‘up the road.”’

The council. also discussed
the 260 books missing from
the library and voted to con
duct a voluntary dormitory
search for the books.

The council also voted to
adopt Article IV of the SGA
bylaws concerning elections.
A paragraph outlawing write
in candidates was deleted.

Clauses in the article pro-
hibit a fifth-year student from
running for an office restrict-
ed to a particular class.

Previous selection proced-
ures of the council have in-
volved personal interviews
with applicants for council-
appointed positions, although
sometimes those who were
not interviewed were appoint-

Affairs

Under the new elections
bylaws, candidates for editor
must be approved by the
Publications Board. All va-
cancies in office are to be
filled by the SGA Senate ex
cept for editors, SGA presi-
dent and Honor Court.

,One faculty member said
that Mrs. Leah Porat's chap-
el talk was much like an en-
cyclopedia.

Mrs. Porat, program direc
tor of the Israel Broaddasting
Company, rattled, off facts
and figures.

Israci wants ‘the people of
America to get a deeper un-
derstanding of a country like
ours,’’ Mrs. Porat said.

The Rumanian born woman
described Isracl as ‘‘a coun-
try like any other — mini-
skirts, pop music, discathe-
ques, all the phases of mod
ern culture.“ She emphasiz-
ed that ‘‘a deeper under-
standing is important.”

In explairiing ‘“‘why Jews
wanted to have a home-
land.’’ Mrs. Porat said that
for 2,000 years the only place
they saw as their home was
the Holy Land and Jerusa-
lem.
