Miniature Vaudeville Staged
in Eu Society

Freshmen Demonstrate Their Ex-
temporaneous Literary Ability

Last Saturday night witnessed some
interesting sights and sounds in the old
Eumenean Society hall. More than
fifty Freshmen had signified their desire
to become members of the society, and
this was the night appointed for them
to show themselves worthy of such an
honor.

The initiation was thoroughly enjoy-
able (to upper classmen) from the time
when the Freshmen imitating all things
from wild beasts to classic dancers, en-
tered the hall until the meeting was de-
clared adjourned by the president. ‘The
reception committee had prepared a pro-
gram which permitted many of — the
Freshmen to exhibit talents, hitherto un-
suspected by themselves
Budding orators, pugilists, singers and
dancers were all given an opportunity to
perform.

Naturally, speaking held first place
on the program. ‘The debates were so
interesting and hotly contested, however,
that other forms of diversion had to be
resorted to in order to relieve the ten-
sion

‘The first event of the evening was a
debate, “Resolved: That Davidson is a
Greater Commercial Center Than New
- York City” by Messrs. Denniston and
"Ogden. The affirmative, having the best
side of the question, was easily victorious
in this encounter. Following the debate.

jt declamation, “Why | Am a_ Freso-
jman,” was delivered by Mr. Meacham.
‘This gentleman made it unanimous by
arguing that he was a° Freshman be-
cause he couldn't be anything clse.

Immediately after this declamation a
terrifying series of boxing matches were

staged. So bitter was the feeling  dis-
played that the boxers had to be blind-
‘folded in order that they might not per-
manently disable ose another. Blows
were struck which, had they reached
their mark, might well have felled Jack
Dempsey. Liston and Cummings, the
referees, were several times knocked
even more insensible than usual.

, The next debate, ‘Resolved: That ice
is not what it's cracked up to be,” was
rather unsatisfactory. “his was fol-
lowed by several musical numbers.
Bethea and ‘Toney rendered entirely new
words to what they supposed to be the
.tune of “Home, Sweet Home.” Buch-
anan, being called on for a solo, sang
that. touching old anthem, “How Green
1 Am!" ‘This song struck a sympathetic
chord in the hearts of the other Fresh-
men who cauld not refrain from joining
in the chorus.

Messrs. Houghton and Guan now ar-
gued the query, “Resolved: That My
Girl is Better Looking Than Yours.”
Although Houghton won this contest,
when he appealed to the judgment of the
president, who had seen a picture of his
girl, it is understood that he did not
come out so well in the debate which he
afterwards staged with J. C. McCaskill.

After a few paper fights, Mr. J. D.

{ Sloan, the Freshman contortionist, was
called on to render the Hula Hula twist.
, With the close of this number it was
realized that the audience could stand
no more excitement, the Freshmen took
the oath of allegiance, and the president
declared the initiations at an end.

HOW IT FELT.

During a brawl in a Chicago resort
an Irishman, got poked in the eye with
a stick, and immediately started pro-
ceedings against the offender.

“Come now.” said the magistrate,

“you do not really believe he meant to

put your eye out?”
“No, I don’t,” said the Celt, “but I
do believe he tried to put it farther in.”

SHE TOILS NOT.

“Why didn’t you come for the wash
yesterday, Liza?”

“T ain’t workin’ no moh, Miss Elsie,
since I jined de lodge. I’se a lily now.”

“What do you mean?”

“I's jined de Lilies of de Fiel’ Lodge

,of de Daughters of Solomon, and de«* Story, J. R.
‘lilies of de fiel’ toils not, neither do dey *

. spin,” —Life.

Spence and Freshmen Have
Big Time in the Society

Many Old and New Men Received
Literary Baptism

The Phi Society held its first regular
meeting of the year Saturday night,
September 13, after the devotional ex-
ercises, conducted by C. G. Long and
the usual reading of the minutes, the
usual program was done away with and
the meeting was “turned over” to the
Freshmen and Spence.

Before the doors were opened to the
Freshmen the following old men were
admitted to the society without ‘‘for-
mal” initiation: C. K. Brown, ’21;
Robt. McLeod, '23; W. W. Roberts,
'22; L. B. Nimmocks, '22, and F. V.
Long, ’21

The house et al. was then turned over
to the invitation committee composed of
. H. Spence, chief bushwhacking art-
ist; J. A. Poteat, ex-officio, Little ’Pos-
sum, and E. N. Booker, high deputy
executioner. The aforesaid gentlemen
induced the Freshmen to dress up, dress
down—and undress before entering.
What a procession it was that ran the
gauntlet of dozens of gentle yet per-
sistent “persuaders’’ on each side of the
aisle. After the Freshmen had erected
themselves at angles of forty-five de-
grees up in the “Amen” corner, Presi-
dent. Chalmers announced that we had
with us an old friend who would now
address us. -At this juncture, Dave
Hale, ‘8, made his appearance and such
n speech he, gave us. Well, we know
the Freshmen will remember it four
years at least.

Spence now informed the guests that
he desired their names with their true
loves in what he termed his ‘‘memory
book”—and. such names as were given!
Well, would stump even R. T. Liston
(of the Eu.) They ran the distance
all the way from “Sally Ox” to “Joan
of Arc.” We must sav these gentlemen
are very truthful or else great law-
yers.

Covington now elucidated on the

question “Why | Take R. O. T. C.”

He seemed to know of forty-nine per-_

fectly good reasons but could think of
but one (censured). Brown then help-
ed him along with some of his ideas on
the subject.
his speech, Covington has ‘em all beat,
and we give him extra excellent.

The series of love letters written by
‘Thames, Gibson and others were “splen-
ducious,” providing you think molasses
edible. If they ever get to be as con-
vincing speakers as they are proficient
“courters,” well, just look out “Sister
Society.” ;

The new men then honored the audi-
ence with some “smiles,” after which
the president took up the good work
and impressed upon them the gravity of
the situation, handing out constitutions
with instructions to “Read in two
weeks.”

The Freshmen were. again made un-
comfortable when the supervisors got
busy, but Spence—that boon to Fresh-
men—again came to their rescue and
saved the day. After the “thanking”
the society adjourned until its next
meeting.

The Freshmen initiated were: W.
E. Covington, W. F. Redding, J. W.
Baldwin, J. D. Bernhardt. A. V. Gib
son, C. E. Hodgin, M. P. Calhoun,
Chas. Ingram, S$. M. Davis, C. Fur-
man, W. P. Kimzey, J. C. Deaver, J.
P. Booth, P. J. Hall, W. P. Brown,
F. C. Thames, S, R. Sloan.
