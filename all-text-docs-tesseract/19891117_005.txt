Homecoming ‘89:
Pomp and circumstance

It finally happened—the
impressive $17 million-dol-
lar Baker Sports Complex
was officially dedicated
amid a flurry of Homecom-
ing activities. Bigwigs, stu-
dents and faculty cele-
brated the beginning of
what some predict to be a
bright future for Davidson
athletics.
