The Davidsonian
Friday. October 24, 1986

By MARK CHEN

Confidentially Yours is a
French movie. The word
“French” can mean different
strokes for different folks.. The
movie is directed by Francois
Tniffaut, an acelaimed director of
the French New Wave movement
in-cinema. The word “director”
can also send chills through
people’s spines, Put “French” and
“director”
people begin searching for the
exil. Many people assume that a
French director must be responsi-
ble for some complex, meaning-
ful, and ultimately boring piece of
art.

There are plenty of movies.
which fit this stereotype, but Con-
fidentially Yours is aot one of
them. After all, the French are
people too, and they do not enjoy
boredom. What the French do like
is a fast-paced and action-packed
movie that could have been made
by a Hollywood studio. Essen-
tially that is the kind of movie
Truffaut has co-written and di-
rected. The French title, Vivement.
Dimanche, reflects this spirit. It
translates as "A Lively Sunday.”
Everything in, the film moves
rapidly in the course of two days
und nights, The movie is most like
another one which was shown at
Davidson, Jagged Edge.

The plot of this movie is in-
credibly convoluted. The movie
begins with a murder. Julien Ver-
cel goes out bunting at the lake
and M. Massoulier is shot in the
head while hunting at the same
lake. The rest of the movie is de-
voted to finding out if Julien shot
Massoutier. Julien returns to his
teal estate firm and fires Barbara,

his secretary. He then finds out—- of Confidentially Yours. Even if—

that he is under suspicion for the
murder of Massoulier, Who was
his wife’s lover, When Marie-
Christine returns from a vacation
in Nice, Julien challenges her with
this affair, She admits to it but has

no guilt. At that moment the
police come and take Julien to the
police station, where they ply him
with further questions. M. Cle-
ments, Julien’s lawyer, tells him
not to worry. Whea Julien returns
home. he finds that his wife has
been shot in the head,

Atleast that is what Jutien tells
Barbara when he meets her. He
asks her to mind the real-estate
firm while he goes to Nice and
hopes to find out who has killed
his wife and Massoulier. In the
meantime he is hiding out at his
office. His plans get changed
when he falls asleep and Barbara
locks him in the office. Then SHE
gets a whim and decides to track.
down the killer in Nice. Both Bar-
basa and Julien go deeper and
deeper into the mystery as leads
pop up and disappear. Red -her-
rings travel through this movie in
schools. By the end of the movie.
there have been four murders, one
suicide, and any number of likely
suspects.

Truffaut has seen a lot of
American movies and has loved
many of them. The style of Confi-
dentialty Yours is pure Hitcheock,
with the humor mixing with and
becoming the backdrop for this
murder mystery. Truffaut takes a
wicked pleasure in deceiving,
misleading, and otherwise leaving
the moviegoer in the dark. The
plot is like that of The Big Sleep, a
40s’ classic directed by Howard
Hawks’ and starring Humphrey
Bogart. That movie was almost a
parody of the detective thriller,
with one absurd coincidence
being piled up on another. Unless
you concentrate, you can't really
figure out the mystery or the plot

you try, the movie goes so Fast that
it could leave you far behind.
Your guides on the tour make
up 2 good cast. Barbara is played
by Fanny Ardant, a famous
French actress who has been in a

number of films, She is sman and
sleek, the necessary qualities for
her role. Julicn ts played by Jean-
Louise Trintignant. He cample-
ments Ardant by being befuddled
most of the time, never thinking
very clearly or quickly, They
make a strange pair. Ardant is a
tall and striking brunette with nice.
legs. Trintignant is a short, bald-
ing, and dumpy-looking Fren-
chman. Probably the marchup is
the result of fantasizing by Truf-
faut, who happens to be short and
bland.

There is a flaw in Confiden-
tially Yours, This flaw comes
back to its French manner and
style. Pardonnez-moifor
American patnotsm, but | don't
think the French do a movie in the
Hollywood style as well as an
American. Truffaut does not go
all-out to make preat trash in the
tradition of Miami Vice. Instead
his lively intelligence keeps the
movie from ever acting serious
about its ridiowlous plot. You al-.
ways. suspect that there is a smirk
on the actors’ faces when the cam-
era is off. In that respect the movie
is French. A French director can-
not completely give himself up to
mindless fun.

So, you may ask, is it oui
ornon? Should F see this movie or
not? My advice depends on what
you're looking for. [f you want In-
gmar Bergman. a GREAT DI-
RECTOR, my ddvice is no.
Sometimes the characters in Con-
fidentially Yours philosophize,
but those moments are as brief as

soap bubbles. The plot is so com- —

plex that it could give you a
headache. My advice is to forget
the plot and go along for the ride.
If you sit back and just watch, you
should have a good enough time.
Confidentially Yours is subtitled

and will be shown tommorow .

night at 8 p.m. in Love Au

“delicate yet decadent

women of Rusk” at homecoming

; By STEVE MANK

Field hockey should be very popular,
For one thing all the players carry hard,
heavy, yard-long sticks and use them to
fight for a tittle stone-like ball that fre-
quently bustles through the air at upwards
of 90 miles an hour. In other words, it has
everything you need for a really good
tumble. For another thing, all the players
wear skirts, What these add up to is all the
potential violence of a pro football game
(without those wimpy pads, of course)
AND the cheerleaders onficld.

What more could the over-active
undes-used male libido, which is typi-
, calty well-represented at spurting events,
want?

But field hockey is-just not that popu-
jar. Perhaps this is because people just
don't know the sport very well, .

As I arrived at the field the two leams
were enguged in cenain pre-game exer:
elses. One consisted of two players

stow]y betGing the ball back and forth at.
‘how. fort's distance, This lirtke work-

out, which I later discovered is ‘called “50

one-time hits” is about the least grueling.

preparation I"ve seen for a varsity event.

As the game began it becomes im-
mediately obvious that this is hike no
other sport. The major clue is that much
of the shouts from the fans conccm
aesthetic matters rather than, say, wib-
ning or losing. One Davidson fan called
eut, “We dress nicer!” A Wake forest
(they were the opponents) fan Later called
out, “Our skins are nicer!" While the
crowd was large (well over 20) they were
polite and did not break into the ritt I had
assumed such a rabble of fashion epi-
cures wauld love to have.

As one watches and hears the clack of
sticks clenched in the bloudthirsty con-
flict, thoughts ‘invariably tum to the na-
ture of the heritage of the spor. While
field hockey is very similar to snceer Pbe-
lieve ts beginnings lie tw ou different
arona.

Ist Athlete: Say guys, let's play polo.

2nd Athlete: But we don't have mal.
Jets.

ist Athlete: Thats okay, we can use
our grandmothers’ canes instead.

2nd Athlete: Bui we don't have
horses,

ist Athlete: That's okay we can use
cleats instead.

Thus hegan the great sport.

Yet field hockey always had to con-

‘tend with the fact that it just was nat foot-

ball. Here are some differences:
‘When a player's mom shows up the

whole feam is attrious to meet her and

courteous to boot,

‘If you start lo lose you can still take
out a few of your opponents and have tun
doing it.

This. last one is Heather's specialty
though she'll never acmit to it. Heather is
the team captain and her last manus is
Mckee. Every time the bal] comes to her
she casually sets ep the shot and then
whacks the Hell out of the mother.

in ose beautiful shot, Heather dowt-

ed a Wake Forest player with a ball to
groin or thereabouts. But Heather claims
she is ot that bad: “1 broke one girl's arta
and injured two,”

Teammate Tyter Smith has a differ-
ent story to tell, “She lies. She troke one
girl's hand and has injured at least one’
girl in cach game.”

All this should make fileld hockey
very well-liked. But few people attend
the home games and only one follows the
group.

So how do we MAKE people go to
fietd hockey games? My proposal is
threefold,

1) Put the games in the stadium and
sell beer and hot dogs and little plastic
Heathers with bobbing heads there.

2) Make a Wildcat Shuffle or
Stickmania video featuring the whole
zany tam caverting in their red tarian
skirts and simulated wildcat pewprint fa-
cial tatoos,

3) Put razor sharp steel tps an theend
of their stioks.
