Varied Appraisals Offered By Coeds

This article is being written in an at-
tempt to do something I believe can-
not be done: in a small space to cap-
ture some of the flavor of what David-
son is like for the freshman co-eds.

Generalizations about anything are
usually misleading, especially when
they touch on something so personal
as what life is like. To prevent this
being a one-sided tirade, a semi-
random survey was taken; kindly
refrain from making any statistical
inferences.

Each student brings different ex-
periences to Davidson with him and so
reacts differently to each situation,
furthermore, we all come here with
different intents. For most of those in-
terviewed, the main factors in-
fluencing decisions to attend David-
son were parental influence, family
tradition, and the reputation and size
of the school.

Visiting the campus also seems to
be a big plus; par ts as well as
students are generally impressed. As
to the rumor that girls come.to David-
son because of the ratio, let me point
out that the ratio is definately on a
downhill course, that lots of other
schools have much better (from the
girls’ point of view) ratios, and as an
unfortunate and sadly funny incident
earlier this year succinctly pointed
out, ratios don’t really mean
anything.

One coed did point out an unex-
pected benefit from the high male to
female ratio: it is easier to become a
member of a group and consequently
“develop close relationships that will
last after you part” but aren’t dating
or “‘love affair” oriented.

For freshmen, orientation is an all-
important first contact with a new set
of surroundings. Later, memories of
that first hectic week fade. but the
remaining impression is that very lit-
tle was accomplished in the way of ac-
tually getting to know other people.
Suggestion for next year; fewer
speakers and more time alloted to
discussions.

Meeting one’s advisor is also an af-
fair of great moment-- after all, this is

the first contact with that amorphous
and all-powerful group known as ‘‘the
faculty.’’ Most contacts with advisors
seem to have been pleasent and ef-
fective, although one co-ed pointed out
“T really have no contact with him ex-
cept to sign my schedule cards or eat
dinner.”” Once again, lack of time
seems to be the villain.

Area requirements are one of the
scariest parts of the curriculum; I
somehow managed to get the befud-
died idea that they all had to be met in
thefirst two years—sheer panic. As one
respondant said: ‘‘Area requirements
are a pain, but they do force one to
broaden views by taking courses that
otherwise wouldn’t be taken.”” Some
doubts were expressed about the
necessity of the tanguage and religion
requirements specifically .

Now for a list of most enjoyable
courses, these were the responses:
Psychology 102; edible plants
seminar and _ medieval art;
humanities; Religion 101, Biology and
Shakespeare. Least enjoyable were
French, Latin (twice), English 21,
Psychology 102, and Sociology 115.
How’s that for demonstrating the
variety among the co-eds?

Opinion about the P.E. require-
ments was slightly more unified; most
seemed to feel that the requirements
are vague and that the present
program is weak. Time is a major fac-
tor involved: a few people suggested
making P.E. a full credit course along
with courses in philosophy of sport
and first aid. There was also general
resentment at being forced to take
part in what should be an activity
engaged in for personal pleasure.

There seemed to be some question
about the existence or non-existence
of social life at Davidson. As someone
pointed out, ‘Forty percent of the
students take off on the weekends.
The ones that remain just party. Yes,
I guess you could call that social life.
It exists.’’ Then there was the respon-
se, ‘‘Social life here is great as far as
I’m concerned.’’ Perhaps the most
poignant was this reply: ‘‘Davidson is
a lonely place for a lot of people.”’

This is one area at Davidson
that can be improved and
enlarged with less effort than
some of our other programs,
but lately there has been no ef-
fort put into it. To illustrate:

In September, over a dozen
letters from students at other
colleges and universities were

requesting information about
our foreign study programs.
Each letter was filed away,
unanswered, not even
acknowledged, until
brochures were printed in
late December.

By that time, of course, all the
inquirers had given up on us
and found other programs.

Ellen Spencer, Dr. Spen-
cer’s daughter, had par-
ticipated in our JY A-Germany
and had recommended it to a
classmate at her college. The
friend received no reply to
three letters to our Office of
International Education.
