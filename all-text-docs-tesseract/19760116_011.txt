Jimmy the Freek

Freek picks IMAC winners.

If anyone has doubts about
who the #1 team in A” league
is, your doubts have been laid
to rest by our expert panel. A
similar poll was taken last
year and turned out to be very
reliable in rating the top 10
basketball powerhouses.

Those who frequent the gym
quite often to view games have
all agreed that I Felta Thi is
the choice for the top position.
However, they also comment-
ed that the balance of top
teams is the best in years. Fol-
lowing is a list of the IMAC
top 10 (based on a 10-9-8-7-6.

.5-4-3-2-lsystem) with first
place votes, total poll points,

various pollsters comments,
and finally my own odds for

the playoffs:

(Continued from page 9)

B: I don’t think the players
will get discouraged. Enough
happens out on the floor, in
the locker room, on the bus,
that people don’t see that keep
the team together. The typical
Davidson student doesn’t like
words such as mental tough-
ness but that’s what it is.
Very rarely do we hop on a kid
for making a mistake. We hop
on them when we don’t get
good effort which tends to
happen in practice. What’s
really important to a kid’s
confidence is the way his
peers, the other players, treat

hm. This is much more impor-
tant than anything a coach
can say to a player.

Q: Another question often
asked is why you use a type of
negative substitution where
players are taken out for
making a mistake during the
game.

B: That’s true--I get mad at
myself when I watch the films
and see that. It really gripes
me and yet I’ll look again and
see some kid not get down the
floor three times in a row and

get mad at myself for not

(1) IFT (7)
70 Defending champs have
everybody back plus Cory
Young. 3-2 to winit all.
(2) KH (with coaches)
52 It’s a big “‘if’’, for if Brown
and Larranaga aren’t there,
ae drops about ten places.
(3) SAE
49 A lot of muscle inside. 6-1
(4) Little Big Men
45 Had excellent recruiting
this year and may be the
sleeper for the upcoming
tourney. 5-1
(5) Maybe Tomorrow
44 Loads of talent,
untested. 9-2.
(6) PDT “B”
39 Too many good players

but

as many are wasted. 4-1

(7) Kerwood Derbies
30 Inconsistent, beat #6
Delts, lost to #9 Gomer’s Pyle.
May be peaking. 8-1

(8) Boris and the Counts
21 Shakey season, but could
surprise. 20-1

(9) Gomer’s Pyle

18 Good group, but are sophs,

lack experience. 15-1

(10) Phi Phenomenon
7 Could be the most intimi-
dating team inside in the
entire ‘‘A”’ league. 50-1

Honorable Mention:

Dirty Old Men 5 Put down
for grades only. 100-1

Barking Spiders 3 What is a
barking spider? 200-1

may hurt them in the long run upon request.

. Brickels defends fouls, substitutions

taking him out. But that’s -
natural; that happens. As long
as the mistake is one of
commission that’s all right but
when it is a mental mistake
they should be taken out. -

Q: But when you take a kid
out for making a mistake he is
forced to sit on the bench and
think about his mistake.
Aren’t you afraid that a player
could lose confidence in him-
self that way?

B: That’s true, but’ in a
period of 40 substitutions
during a night maybe five are
of that nature. Another thing
we so often get is when a kid
hits three jump shots in a row
and we take him out. People
ask ‘‘what the hell?’”’ The kid
is sucking air--he needs a
rest--so we take him out.

Q: You have drawn several
technical fouls this year and at
least one, during the Clemson ~
game, significantly hurt your
team’s chances for victory.
Don’t you think you’re
drawing too many technical
fouls?

B: I get upset by the
technical fouls; I especially
hate to get them when we've

got the ball, as in the game
against Clemson. The only
thing I’ve got to say in defense
of the technical fouls is you’ve
got to know when to get them.
You can’t just get them for the
hell of it. e reason for
technical fouls is this: some
coaches will nit-pick all night

- and upset the refs to the point
where the team will start |

getting bad breaks on calls.

‘My philosophy is to keep your

mouth shut until they do
something bad--then you step
out, bodycheck them, get the
foul and get on with it. I don’t
want my players to get one
and I think I take that load off
of them. .

Q: Do you feel you’re job is
in jeopardy?

B: No. If I thought I was
going to be fired you wouldn’t
see me yelling at the players
and jumping up and down at
the games. I would simply sit
there and love the kids all the
‘time.
