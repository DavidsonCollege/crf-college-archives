THE DAVIDSONIAN

WORTHY SPEAKS —~—

Santo Domingo, Selma
Cited In Chapel Speech

By JOE SAUNDERS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

“Saigon, Selma and Santo Do-
mingo are parallels in futility
and closely related.”

This is the opinion of William
Worthy, newspaper correspon-
dent, who spoke in chapel Mon-
day. His speech attempted to
show that the Negro civil rights
movement is a part of what he
calls the Afro-Asian Latin Amer-
ican Revolution.

Worthy stated that in the past

six years, Negro youths have
alienated themselves from
America. As examples of this,
he pointed to such anti-war
leaflets as ‘Why Negroes Should
Not Fight in America’s Wars",
and the wearing of badges with
such slogans as “The Viet Cong

never called me a ‘nigger’.
Worthy said he felt that the
civil rights movement will link
itself more and more closely to
other revolutionary groups
throughout the world.

As this happens, advocates of
non-violent resistance, such as
Martin Luther King and James
Farmer, will lose control of the
movement, and the black na-
tionalists wil! take ‘over its lead-
ership. He thinks this will be
followed by Watts-type violence
between Negroes, and the Ku
Klux Klan and other segrega-
tionist groups.

In relating civil rights to the
anti-colonialist movement
around the world, Worthy com-
pared President Lyndon John-

be son to Sheriff Jim Clark of
Selma, Both, he said, saw the

tutes the best participation of any district in Mecklenburg

Drama Department |
Readies Ibsen’s Play:

Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of
the People, the third and final
production of the Drama De-
partment, will be presented
Thursday through Saturday in
Hodson Hall.

Curtain time for the first two
nights will be at 8:15 p.m. On
Saturday night, the play will be-
gin at 7:30 p.m., so that it will
conclude before the Bitter-End
Singers’ concert.

Ibsen wrote An Enemy of the
People in retaliation against
the supposedly liberal press in
Norway in 1882. The préss ‘had
first supported Ibsen and _ his
controversial ideas but had
turned on him after he had
written A Doll’s House and
Ghosts.

In An Enemy of the People, :

Ibsen presents a young man
who stands up for what he be-
lieves concerning a sanitation
problem in a Norwegian city
against the opposing views of the
‘people and press.

Dr. Rupert Barber, assistant
professor of drama. comment-
ed. “Ibsen was the ‘the angry
young man’ of the turn of the
century and was just as provo-
cative to the theatre of his day.
as Harold Pinter, John Osborn
and Peter Weiss are now.”

- Peter Van Egmond, instruc-
tod in English, will play the
major role of Dr. Stockmann.

Mrs. Louise Thompson and
Miss Patsy Whitley will play
his wife and daughter respec:
tively. The rest of the cast, in
cluding Bill Andrews. Don Da
vis, John Feuchtenberger. David
Jones, Rawley Turner and Joe
Dial, are Davidson students.

Pritchett To Give
Vespers Sermon

Rev. Carl R. Pritchett, pas-

tor of the Bethesda Presbyte- 4

rian Church, Bethesda, Md., will
speak Sunday at Vespers.
A graduate of Davidson, Pritch-
ett, also served as pastor at
the college church here for 12
years during -the 1940's and
early 1950's. His other pas-
torates have included Smith
field. Anderson. S. C., and now
Bethesda. where he has served
‘or the past eight years.

Pritchett, also a graduate of
Union Theological Seminary in
Richmond, has been called one
of the most courageous min-
isters in his church.

An active and outspoken pro-
ponent of civil rights, he was
recently cited by the Washing-
ton Post for his outstanding
work in helping Negroes in the
town of Scotland, a rura) com-
munity in Maryland.

Worthy compared the Ameri-
can bombing of North Viet Nam
to the Ku Klux Klan bombings
in the South. Calling the United
States “the tormentor of North
and South Viet Nam,” he said
the bombings were an attempt
to spread enough terror to halt

{the anti-colonial revolution.

" Quoting Walter Lippman, he
said, ‘The American people are
morally and intellectually un-
prepared for the reality of
things.”

Worthy maintained that it is
useless for America to play the
role of a modern King Canute
trying to turn back the tide of

WILLIAM WORTHY COMMENTS

“There Is Little Enthu

Viet Nam War.”

Worthy Poi

Of Viet Nam Support

“There. is little enthusiastic
support for the Viet Nam war,”
journalist William Worthy told
a group of students at an in-
formal discussion Monday aft-
ernoon.

Worthy was replying to a
question over a comment by
Sen. Strom Thurmond, who,-
while visiting here last month,
claimed the American people
were wholeheartedly behind the
war.

“There is much begrudging
support.” Worthy continued.
“But even that is being eroded
as things go from bad to worse.”

The correspondent for the Bal-
timore Afro-American drew a
parallel with French public opin-
ion preceding that country’s

As things started getting worse
and worse, there was a desire
to get out at any cost, he said.

“And I don't believe it will
take a 51 per cent majority be-
fore the politicians, especially
the congressmen, will begin to
take significant action," Wor-
thy said.

The world traveler pointed out
that the war is beginning to

ple all over.

Student Council Forms
Evaluation Committee

By BRUCE WEIHE
Davidsonian Steff Writer

A Student Council com-
mittee to investigate curric-
ulum and faculty evaluation
was tentatively formed at
the Student Council meet-
ing Monday night, with sen-
ior representative Ken Au-
trey as chairman.

According to Autrey, the com-
mittee would have two main
purposes: to work with Dean of
Faculty Frontis Johnston’s fac-
ulty committee on course eval-
uation and to initiate a student
evaluation of individual faculty
members.

Concerning the course evalua-
tion, Autrey said that the Stu-
dent Council committee ‘would
act only to offer opinions to the
faculty committee. The course
evaluation is entirely a faculty
project, and if a council mem-
ber is appointed to the commit-
tee, he would serve only in an
advisory capacity, without hav-
ing a vote.”

The faculty committee, which
will be appointed at the next
faculty meeting. will carry on
its investigation concerning cur-
riculum changes next year.

EVALUATION

The faculty evaluation phase
will be more in the line of a
student opinion poll if it is car-
ried out. Autrey stated that the
results will probably be given
to. the individual faculty mem-
bers, and not published for the
student body. Fy

Similar evaluations are held at
Harvard and other schools, with
the results available to the stu-
dents.

“With this evaluation that we

proposed, recommendations con-
cerning class presentation, prep-
eration and interest can be
passed along to the professors,”
Autrey went on. “Of course.
some professors may not accept
the recommendations, but some
will adapt to the students’ opin-
fons.”

PLATFORM IDEAS

Autrey’s proposed committee
was part of a Student Council
work sheet composed of plat-
form ideas from the recent elec-
tion.

The work sheet is comprised
of council programs entailing
two areas: working with fac-
ulty committees on student body
problems as well as problems
that can be handled without
faculty cooperation.

The council plans to work with
the faculty to examine the Ves-
pers attendance regulations,
looking over the validity of
Davidson's Christian commit-
ment and checking ways to ex-
press this commitment.

CUT SYSTEM

In the academic area, in ad-
dition to Autrey’s committee,
The council will also work with
establishment of a free cut sys-
tem, the consideration of exam
regulations and other phases.
The council wil lalso work with
the faculty on academic sched-
uling.

In student affairs, an evalua-
tion of the social situation and
the student body constitution
will be held. To improve stu-
dent services, there are plans to
institute more student | ex-
changes, investigate a free local

things.

According to the work sheet
the council plans to consider
a plan to abolish compulsory
ROTC and examine job oppor-
tunities and wages in campus
jobs.

There will also be a delega-
tion to the Southern Universities
Student Government Association
(SUSGA) comprised of Ben Can-
mon, John Gresham and Bill
Watson. The convention wil! be
held in Jacksonville, Fla., May
$-7.

ROOMMATES REVISITED

This morning’s mail brought a letter from a student at
a prominent Western university (Princeton). ‘‘Dear Sir,”
he writes. ‘In a récent column you said it was possible to
get along with your roommate if you try hard enough.
Well, I’d like to see anyone get along with my roommate!
Mervis Trunz (for that is his name) practices the ocarina
all night long, keeps an alligator, wears knee-cymbals, and
collects airpiane tires. I have tried everything I can with
Mervis Trunz, but nothing works. I am desperate. (signed)
Desperate.”

Have you, dear Desperate, really tried everything? Have
you, for example, tried a measure so simple, so obvious,
that it is easy to overlook? I mean, of course, have you of-
fered to share your Personna® Super Stainless Steel Blades
with Mervis Trunz?

‘o have a friend, dear Desperate, you must be a.friend.
And what could be more friendly than sharing the bounty
of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades? Who, upon en-

oying the luxury of Personna, the nickless, scrapeless, tug-
ess, hackless, scratchless, matchless comfort of Personna,
the ease and breeze, the power and glory, the truth and
beauty of Personna—who, I say, after such jollies could
harden his heart against his neighbor? Nobody, that’s who
—not even Mervis Trunz—especially not today with the
new Personna Super Blade bringing us new highs in speed,
comfort, and durability. And here is still a further bonus:

r style.

luck: while out prospecting, he discovered what is without

made Basil very rich except that nobody, alas, has yet dis-
covered a use for feldspar. Today Basil, a broken man,
squeezes out a meagre living a2 a stalagmite in Ausable

Nor has E. Pluribus fared conspicuously better. Once
Basil got the miner’s cap, E. Pen was able to catch up
on his long-lost sleep. He woke after nine days, refreshed
and vigorous—more vigorous, alas, than he realized. It was
the afternoon of the Dean’s tea. E. Pluribus stood in line
with his classmates, waiting to shake the Dean’s hand. At
last his turn came, and E. Pluribus, full of strength and
health, gave the Dean a firm handshake—so firm, indeed,
that all five of the Dean’s knuckles were permanently fused.

The Dean sued for a million dollars and, of course, won.
Today E. Pluribus, a broken man, is paying off his debt by
walking the Dean’s cat every afternoon for ten cents an hour.
