Maybe you've noticed this year
the lack of publicity on the part of

Last year he was the “fair-haired”
boy of the Navy team. This year his
name is only seen in the lineup; it’s
all Ingram this year. I heard from
a reliable source that Schmidt is

will block for anybody. It's the same
old story. See how much a star

Coach Weaver to Bring Best

BOTH ELEVENS PRIMED

Of Fracas
The long-anticipated day is al-
most here when the Demon Dea-
cons of Wake Forest will venture

into the lair of the Davidson Wild-
cats to seck revenge for three con-
secutive defeats in their traditional
football rivalry. It is expected that
every seat in Richardson field will
be occupied when the two teams

line up for the opening kickoff,
as interest in the coming gridiron
classic is at the highest pitch in
years.

Coach Jim Weaver will bring the
best Wake Forest team in a decade
to battle the Wildcats. The Wakes

eleven several pounds to the man,
The Deacons are not fooling about
this game — they intend to win.
