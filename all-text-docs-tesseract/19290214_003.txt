Freshmen Heartily
Greet First Snow

Many Southerners See Snow For
First Time

On Tuesday morning, February 5, the
student, body awoke to gaze upon the first
snowfall of the winter. For some it was
the first snow ever seen and+was wel-
comed with delight, while those for whom
the spectacle was no*longer a novelty
greeted with pleasure the return of the
familiar coat of white in which the earth
was wrapped. Only the Freshmen looked
crestfallen, and well they might, for as
everyone knows, Freshmen at Davidson
do not welcome snow.

It soon became evident that any fears
which might have been entertained were
well grounded. After chapel Tuesday
morning, the Freshmen, leaving the build-
ing last, were greeted with a shower of
snowballs. This continued throughout
the morning with the “Fresh,” completely
at the mercy of their tormentors, unable
to strike back in their own defense. This
did not appeal to their idea of the fair-
ness of things so a challenge was prof-
fered and immediately accepted by the
Sophomores. The battle was to begin at
2:30 sharp and at the appointed hour the
opposing hosts were to be seen drawn
up in battle array, eager to begin the
combat.

Soon the white missiles began to fly
in all directions with first one side and
then the other holding the advantage.
From one side to the other, back and
forth, and in every nook and corner of
the cdmpus the battle raged. Howeyer,
as is usually the case in such matters,
neither side was able to force the hand
of the other and as neither side capitulated,
both left the field claiming the victory.
So we may conclude that the battle was
a draw. In any case, everyone was well
pleased with the event, for a snowball
battle at Davidson is not to be listed un-
der the heading of an everyday or com-
monplace occurrence.

Students Pleased °
With New Benches

The students living in West and East
dormitories have announced themselves as
being greatly with
benches that were recently placed — in
front of each building. The seats are of
an attractive style that also blend with
the color of the dormitories’ columns. On
days when weather will permit, there is
now a place to sit without being forced
to bring chairs from the lobby inside.

is the title of this method. Eight
years were required to perfect this
great work. The entire course with
the necessary examination sheets,
is bound in one volume. The first
