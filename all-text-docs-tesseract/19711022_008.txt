Brickels Hopeful For Young Cagers

“We are going to make some-
thing happen this vear. It might
not be the right thing. but if
we're going to make mistakes.
we’re going to make mistakes
doing something!”

Assistant basketball coach Bo
Brickels made the above pre-
diction as the 1971-72 version
of the Wildcat basketball team
began practice last Friday, and
that prediction, along with ev-
erything else he said, was made
with optimism about the com.
ing season.

“We have two varsity re-
turnees, Eric Minkin and John
Pecorak, two guys who have
never played a varsity game,
and nine sophomores, and you
just can’t play that way but
we're gonna do it anyway,”
Brickels commented.

This year’s schedule is the
toughest that any Davidson team

Runners Split Meet,
Even Season Mark

By JIM HANNA
Copy Editor

The Wildcat cross-country
team will have a better season
than last year’s, even if they
lose the rest of their races.

The harriers were 1-14 last
year; they are already 3-3 this
season, with the most recent
results being a 1 - 1 split with
VMI and Washington and Lee.

Last Monday the ’Cats lost to
VMI but beat Washington and
Lee in a tri-meet in Lexington,
Va.

“The win against W&L might
be one of the last for the David-
son runners, as Coach Sterling
Martin’s charges face a rough
schedule rounding out the sea-
son.

The harriers travelled to The
Citadel this morning, where
they will face a squad termed
by Martin to be ‘‘at least as
strong as VMI,” a team which
handled the ’Cats 15-42 Monday.

Tuesday will see a six-team
meet here at Davidson, as the
‘Cats will host Wake Forest,
Appalachian, Pembroke, High
Point, and Furman.

has ever faced, according to
Brickels. The ‘Cats meet Clem-
son, Pittsburgh, Princeton,
Duke, Dayton, and South Caro-
lina in Charlotte, plus Furman
and East Carolina, and then add
Notre Dame and UCLA in a
few vears.

“You look at some of the na-
tionally ranked teams. With
they're schedules we could win
twenty games easily, but with
ours it’s gonna be a little tough-
er. We have some tough games
early, and since we are young,
we're gonna need to win to gain
some confidence,” he added.

‘We're not big, but we're ag-
gressive as hell and we're quick.
Our quickness is unbelievable,
and we're gonna make things
happen. We're gonna be inter-

FLICKERBALL FINALS MONDAY

Unbeaten Kappa Sigs, Delts
Clash In IMAC Tournament

By HOWARD BOYD
Asst. Sports Editor

The only two remain unbeat-
en teams in IMAC flickerball
square off Monday afternoon in
the finals of the IMAC tourney.

The Delts and the Sigs were
scheduled to play last Thursday,
but the game was called by
mutual agreement because of
the light rain.

The Sigs walloped the SAE‘s
45-19 while the Delts squeezed
past Emanon | 27-26 in semi-
final play to set the stage for
the big game.

In Monday's quarterfinal ac-
tion, the Sigs broke open a tight
game in the second half and
knocked out the Indies 28-14.
Leading only 7-0 at halftime,

esting to watch.

“On offense we're definitely
going to run. We’re going to use
a pressing type defense. We're
going to have to press to com-
bat the height we’re going to be
facing. We’re not that big.

“I don't think anybody’s go-
ing to be able to run us man to
man. And if they zone us, then
we've got some super shooters.
The trouble right now is what
are we going to do at the other
end, how to stop the other guys.
We're going to need a super
defense,” Brickels commented.

“You can’t say who is going
to start ‘cause who knows. We're
going to play eight or nine guys.
We have to play the type of
game we're going to play. It’ll
look a lot like last year’s North

the Sigs pulled away on second
stanza scores by Paul Whetsell,
Bill Mohr and Cooper Geraty.
The Indies wound up 5-3.

The Delts edged a stubborn
band of SPE’s 20-14, as Drew
White, Hugh Gaither and Vic
Fleming scored once each to
offset a two-touchdown perform-
ance by the losers’ Eddie John-
ston.

The E’s nipped the Pikas in
a defensive battle 18-13. Roy
Campbell, Nick Livengood and
Bruce Baird tallied early and
the defense held off the Pika
offense, once again sputtering
without tailback Blair Abee.

Emanon I reached the semis
with a surprisingly easy 49-13
romp over the Taus. Robbie Lit-

Carolina team,” he said.

“We've got to utilize what
we've got. We've got talent,
we've got speed, we've got
quickness, but more then any-
thing else, more importantly
then all the rest, is that we've
got people that want to play,”
Brickels concluded.

tle had a pair of TD’s and five
teammates joined the scoring
parade for the victors, who led
21-0 at halftime.

In closing regular season
games, the Delts claimed their
fourth unbeaten season in the
last five by bombing Watts I
41-6, behind Drew White, Vic
Fleming and Jack Hartman.

The Sigs chalked up their
seventh straight win by shel-
lacking Cannon-Watts 70-0, as
Pete Jorgenson led the way
with 3 TD's.

The E's bounced Cannon II
35-7 as Dave Weaver and Roy
Campbell scored three and two
times, respectively.

Emanon I blasted PAX 47.0,
paced by Sam Upchurch’s pair
of scores and one each by five
teammates.

The Indies got touchdown re-
ceptions from Jim Parish and
Tim Ebert and a safety on a
bad center snap to halt the
KA’‘s 15-6 and claim the second
playoff berth in B I.

Tailback Steve Williams tal-
lied on a 18-yard run for the
losers’ only points.

The SPE’s won over W Il by
forfeit and Emanon 11 forfeited
to the Pikas.
