Shoemaker (Fiji) and Frank Clark
(SPE), were also invited to the meet-
ings.

“We tried to be thorough and listen
to various concerns and viewpoints,”
explained the mayor. “This is not only a
college problem, and the ordinance
should be fair.”

According to the Town of Davidson
Noise Ordinance, the daytime sound
level limit for Sunday through Thursday
is 70 decibels from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00
p-m. and a 70 decibels from 8:00 a.m.
to | a.m. on Friday and Saturday. Dur-
ing the night on weekdays, the noise
level limit is 55 decibels.

However, exceptions to these rules
can be made to benefit special events or
big weekends like Homecoming or
Spring Frolics. During these occasions,
the daytime limit (8:00 a.m. to 2:00
a.m.) is 80 decibels, and the nighttime
limit is 55 decibels. The fine for violat-
ing the provisions of the Ordinance runs
as high as $100.

David Shoemaker, president of the
Fiji house, feels that the students could
have been more responsible and in-
volved if they had been approached and
asked to compose a separate college
noise ordinance. As to the effect of the
noise ordinance, he said, “The noise is
related to band parties mostly, and I
don’t think they will be a problem from
now on, because they’ll be indoors.”

So far, the ordinance has been up-
held and students have been very coop-
erative. “It’s not the students’ fault any-
way,” remarked Dean Terry. “It’s the
band members who sometimes wait un-
til our backs are turned and who put up
the sound again.” Dean Terry said that
the noise is relative and should be meas-
ured closer to the source.

Mayor MacCormac feels that the
Noise Ordinance is working. “This fall,
the community has felt the noise to be
excessive, but the level did not exceed
the decibel number. People are aware of
the Ordinance, and by being more
aware, they are more sensitive.”

New Golf Course
Completed

Na

TONY DICK ’85

Construction of a 3-hole golf
course behind the baseball field was
completed last Monday, 11 October.
Beside aiding the golf team, Coach
Thomas Cartmill says the course will
be used for golf instruction in P.E.

credit classes and campus community

recreation.

The combination 3-hole recre-
ation course and practice area for
P.E. classes and the golf team will be

“the biggest asset we ever had, from

the standpoint that the team can prac-
tice an hour a day without spending
40 minutes a day travelling to and

costs.

Cartmill says this will not be the
first golf course on the Davidson col-
lege Campus. He says that before
World War II, the college had a 9-
hole course where the lower tennis
courts and flickerball intramural
fields are now. -

The current project was initiated
after Mr. Howard Covington, °37,
chairman of the board of Covington
Diesel, Inc., of Greensboro, donated
$200,000 to the college. According to
the Davidson Update, he directed that
$25,000 go to the varsity golf and tennis
programs.

The college will use $100,000 to
help endow a visiting professorship pro-
gram and deposit the remaining
$50,000 into a property aquisitions
fund. Tennis team Coach Jeff Frank
said Wednesday that the tennis team has
deposited its $25,000 allocation in an
investment account to help with team
expenses.

Dedication ceremonies for the
$25,000-plus project will be held next
spring when the grass seeds have fully
rooted and the course becomes playa-
ble.

Davidson
Names New

Development
Officer

~

Henry H. Doss has been promoted
to director of corporate and foundation
relations for Davidson College. He suc-
ceeds Michel C. Daisley, who served in
the position for more than two years and
is enrolling in UNC law school this fall.

Doss joined the Davidson staff two
years ago as community relations direc-
tor for WDAV, the college’s non-com-
mercial FM radio station.

In his new job, Doss will seek sup-
port for the college’s “1987 Program”
from corporations and regional busi-
nesses, as well as private foundations.
That campaign seeks to raise more than
£35 million for capital improvements,
endowment and current expenses. prior
to the college’s sesquicentennial in

1987.

Two prominent alumni who will
work closely with Doss in the corporate
fundraising effort are Robin L. Hinson,
class of ’53, a Charlotte attorney, and
Dr. Charles F. Myers, class of ’33, a

Greensboro resident and retired chief
executive officer of Burlington Indus-
tries.

Dr. Jack W. Powers, vice president
for development, said, “The success of
the radio station’s recent fundraising
and public relations efforts testify to
Henry’s capability in the field. I am-cer-
tain that he will do an equally excellent
job in the broader context he will now
manage.”

Doss, who grew up in Matthews, re-
ceived his B.A. degree from UNC-
Charlotte in 1976. He and his wife, the
former Martha Mae Sloop of Concord,
live in Davidson and have two daugh-
ters, Catherine Ann and Mary Eliza-
beth.

Colleges Start
Crackdown on
Student
Drinkers

(CPS)-According to the new signs
posted around the stadium there will not
be any more drinking at University of
Alabama football games this year.
Campus police and local law enforce-
ment officials have geared up to watch
fans for telltale signs of carrying booze
to the game.

At Notre Dame, there’s another
tough new anti-drinking policy. Start-
ing this fall, students can no longer
bring alcohol onto university property.

Indiana University is going even
farther. University officials are making
unannounced “spot checks” for alcohol
at the public areas of campus dorms and
fraternity houses to enforce a new no-
booze-on-campus rule.

Colleges and universities around the
country this fall are imposing tough new
drinking policies and are creating new
means of making the policies stick.

Students who run afoul of the new
rules typically face disciplinary actions
escalating from reprimands to suspen-
sions, ‘with mandatory attendence at al-
cohol education classes. Some schools
are tougher: Notre Damers caught vio-
lating the school drinking policy are lia-
ble for a $100 minimum fine.

Not all students are happy about it.
Indiana’s student government is invit-
ing student complaints against the

“raids,” worrying about students’ pri-~

vacy rights.

' But the new wave of anti-drinking
policies has yet to evoke much student
response one way or the other.

. The administrators’ abrupt fervor
follows drinking law changes in dozens
of states over the last three years.

Spurréd by grassroots groups such
as Mothers Against Drunk Drivers

(MADD) and increasing pressure from
New Right coalitions such as Jerry Fal-
well’s Moral Majority, state legistlators
around the country have enacted stiffer
laws against drunk drivers, raised the
minimum drinking ages and increased
pressure on liquor stores and bars not to
sell alcohol to individuals who are un-
der-age or already intoxicated.

And now colleges, too, are respond-
ing to what they call “‘an increased pub-
lic awareness of alcohol abuse and de-
mands for stricter controls.”

“There’s definitely a greater level of
concern throughout the higher educa-
tion community to address [alcohol]
problems,” observes Dr. Gerardo Gon-
zalez, president of Boost Alcohol Con-
sciousness Concerning the Health of
University Students (BACCHUS), and
director of the Campus Alcohol Infor-
mation Center at the University of Flori-
da.

“There’s no question we have a big
problem,” Gonzalez says. “About 90
percent of all college students drink,
and we know from studies that 15 to 20
percent are problems drinkers.”

He defines a problem drinker as
“any student whose use of alcohol re-
sults in frequent negative consequences
to themselves or to others.”

Although the number of students
with alcohol problems appears to have
peaked in the last few years, Gonzalez
says, “it has stabilized at a drastically
high level.”

Twenty years ago, he points out,
only 70 percent of the college students
were altohol drinkers, and only six per-
cent were classified as problem
drinkers.
