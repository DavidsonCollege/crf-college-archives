Union Gallery exhibit focuses on physical obsessions

By George Weld

Two exhibitions up right now
— one in the Van Every Gallery of
the VAC and one in the Union
Gallery — are sure to attract atten-
tion, probably for the wrong rea-
sons. The Ansel Adams show in
the Van Every is sure to be one of
the most popular shows of the year,
bound to draw in dozens of people
who want to see the real thing after
having admired Adams’ photo-
graphs reproduced in calendars,
on posters, and on book jackets.
The Charles Walker show in the
Union Gallery will draw a differ-
ent sort of attention, one stimu-
lated by the combination of
Walker’s explicit treatment of sex
and an untraditional hanging which
is the sort of thing that inclines the
already skeptical or upset viewer
to say something like, “... but why
is this art?”

Walker’s show is entitled “Hu-
man Factories” and is, according
to his artist’s statement, meant to
deal with peoples’ physical obses-
sions, the elements that combine to
form the world and our bodies, and

the physicality of painting. The
show’s concern with the last of
these is the most obvious. The
canvases are
unstretched, and hung apparently
randomly, without achieving or
trying to achieve a coherent effect.
The paintings flap in the breeze
when the door is opened; they are
wrapped around the corners of the
gallery. One wonders constantly
how one is supposed to take cer-
tain paintings: where two canvases
are juxtaposed or overlapping it

isn’t clear whether they are meant |

to be part of one painting, the two
panels of adiptych, or totally unre-
lated. Both the show taken as a
whole and the paintings taken in-
dividually have the feeling of be-
ing broken down, reduced to their
components and relieved of any-
thing as extraneous as stretchers or
titles. The show probably wouldn’t
have looked much different if it
had been held in Walker’s studio.

The breakdown that charac-
terizes the overall show is appar-
ent in form and content of the paint-
ings themselves, as well. In one

untreated,,

painting a schematic of circles and
connecting lines is superimposed
on the image of a pair of people in
such a way as to emphasize the
figures’ heads, hands and feet; the
painting feels self-analytical as it
emphasizes the basic elements of
its ownsubjects. In another slightly
heavy-handed painting the culture
(I think) of native northwestern
Americans is presented as a loose
montage of symbols representing
important elements of the life of
these people: harpoons and hypo-
dermic needles, ice floes and oil
slicks. In another painting, color is
broken down; and in what is surely
the most notorious of the paintings
sex is broken down and presented
elementally (aclose-up of awoman
with her mouth against some shape

phallic enough to get the point .

across) and without embellishment
(a plain line drawing of a couple
having sex).

One or two of the paintings
here don’t seem to belong in this
show: a small orange painting and

.a larger red one seem a little out of

place. The rest of the show is

Second Prize — “Round
Here.” VH-1 fodder. Even for the
Counting Crows, this is painful
stuff. The highlight is the fake-
dredlocked singer Adam Duritz lip
syncing as he walks down a rail-
road track. Would you like some
cheese with your whine, Mr.
Duritz?

- PEOPLE TO WATCH IN
1995 (EXPECTANTLY). First
Prize — Pearl Jam has a new al-
bum, Vitalogy, coming out now.
Their last two have been excellent,
and if the third is a charmer, as one
of my roommates said, “People
will begin to look at them as the
best band of the decade.”

Second Prize — Sarah
McLachlan. She has gotten better
with each album, and a new CD is
planned for the latter half of 1995.
A great piece of work is guaran-
teed, whenever it appears.

Third Prize — Electro-luxe.
This band of early ‘90’s Davidson
grads stands a good chance of get-
ting that magical thing called The
Contract next year. If they getit, it
will be because they deserve it
they have a lot of talent.

PEOPLE TO WATCH IN

1995 (WARILY). First Prize —
Lisa Loeb. She’s going to have to
pull off a miracle to avoid being
the one-hit-wonder: who: did the
song “Stay” and milked it for ev-
erything she could. She’s set to put
an album out in 1995 and I hope the
best for her. But I will not be

placing bets on her being anything
more than a Suzanne Vega lite.

Second Prize — Metallica. I
pity the fans of the world’s oldest
speed metal band. They seemed to
have forgotten that it is nice to
have anew album to promote when
you go on tour.
beens, orare they preparing metal’s
Dark Side of the Moon? Maybe
next year we will find out.

Third Prize — U2. Like
Metallica, this quartet is also
against the artistic ropes.. Bono’s
voice has been weakening since
Rattle and Humand, to put itkindly,
their last album was not up to their
usual high standards. If they want
to remain the most famous band in
the world, they need to put out a
high quality studio album like
1991’s Achtung Baby.

mixed: and varied enough to be
interesting and will reward more
attention than most people are prob-
ably going to give it. The painting
of the couple having sex (this would
be so much easier to write if these
paintings had titles) is happily more
playful than such paintings typi-
cally are; there’s none of the melo-
drama or preachiness in this paint-
ing that so many young painters
seem to feel obliged to engage in.
Some of the paintings seem
muddled, but many of them are
interesting in their disruption of
their own tendency or mode: the
candy cane in the painting of the
couple having sex; the overlay of a
network of circles in another paint-
ing; and the dots of pure color in
another are all surprising in the
way that they jar the compositions.

One might wish that this show
weren’t so comfortably
postmodern: some of the disrup-
tion, the self-analysis, and the self-
exposure is almost conventional
now, and the hanging of the show
seems almost gimmicky. None-
theless, I at least am glad this show
is here as much because of the
reaction it has spurred in people (if
you’ re bored one day there’ s plenty
of entertainment to be had from
sitting in the pit and listening to
people as they walk by) as because
of the paintings themselves.

There will be a reception for
Charles Walker on January:20 at
6:30; gallery committee chair Jen-
nifer Tracy promises that Walker
is entertaining and eager to talk
about his work, which will be up
until February 11.

Dear Terry,

Iwasa good kid during 1994.
Accordingly, Santa brought me
quite a few goodies. The prob-
lem is not a lack of gifts but the
kind of gifts I recieved. I got
some really random stuff that I
don’t think I will ever use. What
should I do? I am embarrased to
ask for reciepts, but I don’t want
to let my family’s and friends’
generosity go for naught. I need
advice.

Sincerely,

Inappropriately Gifted

Dear Gifted,

Your concern for the feel-
ings of your family and friends is
admirable. I, too, often receive
gifts for which I have no use.
Easy-bake ovens, cement mix-
ers, and Grizzly Adams trash cans
are nice additions to any room

decor, but they possess little prac-
tical value. In situations like this,
there are two options. One: Ap-
ply the saying “It’s the thought
that counts” and ask your patrons
for the receipts. If they truly are
your friends, they will understand
that you do not dislike them or
their gift per se, you just want to
exchange it for something more
fitting your needs. Two: Realize
that even tacky and useless pos-
sessions have character—more
character, in fact, than many
“nice” gifts. What would you
notice more, anice, Waterford vase

. oranabstract sculpture of Ghengis

Khan your aunt picked up in
Eurasia? So, if you were lucky
enough to get Earl Klugh’s new
album, a pair of green bellbottoms,
and a copy of Dianetics, enjoy
them. Listen, wear, and read, and
perhaps your random gifts will
turn into goodies themselves,
Love, Terry

Yes, Nicole, we want you to
write for The Davidsonian.
Oh, and anyone else, too.
