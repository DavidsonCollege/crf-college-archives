New Dance Plan

Our new Pan-Hellenie Council is to be
congratulated on the fine start they have
made toward higger and better danees.
For a long time sutdents have felt that
Davidson should haye better danee bands,
and not only better bands, but some “big-
name” bands. With the new plan ia effect
the way will be open to get these “name”
hands, and make our danees even more of a
suecess than they have been.

The Councit's new plan (fully explained
on page 1} has many advantages. one of the
biggest being that Davidson witl have the
chance to get the best bands in the country.
just as other sehools have had in the past.
College danecs have long sinee tisen from
the stage where a local band would play for
a set attended by only the girls who lived-
in the vicinity of the school. Now, dances
are looked forward to with keen anticipa-
tion, girls travel hundreds of miles, and
they climax ail social activities. With a
good band playing for dances, and a “name”

band for some, Davidson's. dfnees will rise
{0 even greater lame.

Another advantage, by no means second-
ary, is the fact that the cost of dances to
the individual student wilt be less. Jn the
past we have paid various prices for a sct,..
ranging from four to ten dollass. Under the
new plan, four dollars will be the fixed
price, exeept for Mid-Winters. which will
continue to be the feature set. and will cost—
five dollars. With three dance sets at four
dollars, and aifother at five, the total for |
the year is seventeen -dollars, which is
cheaper than the total price this -year, and
which will be a good many dollars cheaper
than the price which would have been’ paid _
had we had bands such as wilt play if the
new plan passes. The new plan will save
any man who goes to all dances about ten
dollars a-year as a minimum, and probably
more.

The third advantage of the new plan is
guarantee against financial loss. This loss
not only concerns members of the Council,
but each member of the nine social frater-
nities, since it is apportioned among them.

Under our present set-up, there has been
no way to accurately decide the amount of
money that would be available for each
dance, and consequently when the Council
has guessed wrong, it has lost money. Be-
cause of the fear of such loss, each past
Council has been forced to plan one or two
sets when receipts would greatly surpass
costs, and because of this there has been
general dissatisfaction among the students.
When the Council knows how much it can

tote ren ere eee ee -EDITOR:IN-CHIEF, {.

soar bssociate—Edivor—

count on for each set, it can plan ahead,
make contracts and spend their money in
such a way as to break even for the year.
This will prevent sets at which the band
is a cheap one, because the Council wil! not
have to make up a deficit.

The plan is equally denefieral for fra-
ternity and non fraternity men. Fraternity
men will be the backers and guarantors.
but non-fratemmity men will profit ie the
same away as fraternity men. There will
be no difierenee in price, no discrimination
between the two classes. Every advantage
of the plan is equalty beneficial to all”
students.

These advantages are casily seen. Prob-
ably there will be no trouble in getting
every fraternity to back the plan, and there
should not be. During the past -year every
fraternity has had almost thirty men pres-

“ent at every set anyhow, Fhe cheaper pricc—|.

next year will eneourage more tmen to at-

—tead, and should bring the aumber—well_.|

over the minimum. However. even if it
“should not in a few cases, it will be cheaper
in the long rain.

Set prices, when there is a big band play-
ing, have averaged about seven dollars as
a minimum in the past. If a man attended
two dance sets the total would be fourtecn
wollars. Under the new plan, if a man at-
tends two sets, he will pay eight or nine
dollars, plus the small assessment he might
owe if his fraternity did not have thirty
men at the other sets. fr most’ cases, he
would not fave to pay anything for these
dances he dtd not attend, beeause there
would be thirty from his chapver already
paid, but in the few scases where there
would be an assessment or, chapter pay-
ment, it would not be enough to offset the
saving from the pree that would be paid
for only two sets under the old plan. This
is a slightly complicated argument, but any-
one ean sec the truth in it with a little
thought. |

A-Social Center?

As preparations go forward for the erec-
tion of the new library. speculation as to
what will be done with the old library build-
img begins to bubble.

Twe years ago a rumor invated the cam-
pus that a new library was to be ‘ouilt im-~
mediately. and the suggestion v was “made

that the old structure be converted mto a
social center and recreation ‘room. Cer-
tainly this plan could be carried out just as
well now as two years ago.

Everybody knows that non-fraternity men
have no place on the campus to take their
visitors. The social committce of the Y. .M.
C. A. has done an excellent piece of work
in opening the doors of the social center
after football games, but outside of sévéral
Saturday afternoons in the fall a non-fra-
ternity man can do nothing to entertain his
visitors.

A social center in the old library would
be better than nothing. Rooms on the first
floor: could be converted into parlors and
reading rooms, while the long room on the
second floor could accommodate five or six
ping pong tables. The basement could be
cleaned out, and in time a kitchenette anid
rest, rooms could be installed.

Where is the money coming ‘from? Well,
that’s a good question. We have nothing to
offer except the suggestion. Perhaps Pi
Gamma Mu could include this objective on
its list of projects, or perhaps some public
spirited alumnus or alumni who havé taken
the trouble to read this far will be in-
terested enough to donate the money. Or
perhaps the Y. M. C. A. could make this its
gift fund project for next year—P.W.B.
