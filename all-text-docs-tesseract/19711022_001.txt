Board Adopts

_ Rejects Librar

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

The board oi trustees today
approved preliminary draft of
the trustee by - laws’ which
change the composition of the
board and gives broad powers
to the president and his admin-
istrative officers.

In further action the board
expressed approval of the _ in-
terior plans of the library, but
directed the architects to re
vise the facade of the building.

No action was taken on co-
education. And the goverance
committee was expanded by
the addition of two trustee, two
Student, two faculty and two
administrative members.

The change in the structure
of the board as approved in
the by-laws called for a reduc-
tion in size of its members
from 51 to 42,

In the future the board will
include 26 members elected by
the Presbyteries of North Car-
olina and Florida, 12 members
elected by the alumni, and
eight at-large members elected
by the trustees. At least four
of the at-large members must
be Davidson alumni.

“The purpose of instituting
at-large members is to allow
the college to secure from other
geographical areas the services

of individuals who are _inter-
ested in the future of Davidson
College,” said Warner L. Hall,
chairman of the board.

In contrast to the previous
set of by-laws, the new ones
do not list the specific powers
of the President and his ad-
ministrative officers.

However, under the new pro-
visions the president may make
faculty appointments without
trustee action. He also may
“hold up” action taken by fac-
ulty or students if he deems
that it will endanger the well-
being of the college communi-
ty, according to Hall.

“This is not a veto power,”
said College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. ‘‘Once action has
been suspended, the president
may ask the particular body to
reconsider or he may lay the
matter before the board of
trustees.”’

The by-laws also include a
‘new section on Faculty and
Student organizations, which
states that the Faculty Consti-
tution, the Student Government
Constitution and other official
documents must be approved by
the trustees.

In addition the by-laws call
for all campus organizations to
be chartered and thet they
shell be subject to approval by

‘Does The RHC Have Any Future?

By DOUG BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor

Members of the Residence

Hall Council (RHC) will be
elected this Tuesday, and the
question in the minds of many
is whether the RHC is a viable
organization. Student Body Pres-
ident Danny Clodfelter com-
mented, ‘‘A number of the func-
tions of the RHC have been
shifted to other people and or-
ganizations. The question is
whether it should continue to
exist.”

Dean of Students Will H. Ter-
ry seconds this view by saying,
“Any organization which has
outlived its usefulness has no
real reason to stay in opera-
tion.” Terry favors an RHC
which would be drastically dif-
ferent from the way it is pre-
sently constituted.

In Terry’s view, the RHC
should be geared more towards
the problems of the individual
dorms, and this could best be
accomplished by a number of
autonomous councils dealing
with the problems of their re-
spective dorms. .

Residence Hall Council Pres-
ident Bill Alexander has_ his
own goals for the RHC, but ‘he
said, ‘‘I must wait until the new
RHC is elected before the RHC
moves in any. definite direc-

tions.’ This Tuesday is a late
date for elections, and Alexan-
der blames Senior Class Presi-
dent Bill Lear for this.

Lear is charged with running
student elections, and Alexander
said, ‘“RHC elections are being
hetd at this late date because
Bill Lear wanted to avoid doing
the work he was supposed to
do. | did not want the RHC elec-
tions held at the same time
that elections for senators were
held because too many people
were already running for of-
fice.”

Alexander added, ‘‘Also, I felt
that those who were defeated-in
their races for the senate should
have the opportunity to run for
the RHC. Bill Lear only wanted
elections held twice, once for
senators and once for the re-
ferenda. Lear refused to run
RHC elections when I wanted
them run.”

In response to Alexander’s
charges concerning the late
RHC elections, Lear said, ‘‘Alex-
ander did not ask me to have
elections for the RHC until the
night after elections for sen-
ators had been held. He said
that he wanted the elections
held ‘within the next week or
so.’ ”

Lear continued, ‘It takes two
weeks to properly plan for an
election, and it had already
been decided that we were go-

ing to run referenda in 4 weeks.
Alexander_was perfectly aware
of the elections schedule. As far
as I am concerned, the 2 weeks
difference between the time
Alexander wanted an election
held and the time the referenda
had been scheduled might as
well have been 2 years for all
the work that the RHC has
done under Bill Alexander.
“It is obviously an inefficient
waste of time to run three cam-

pus-wide polls within a month,
the extent of which Alexander is
not aware of as he has never
volunteered in the past to help
with elections, as have most
other senators,” said Lear.
Alexander's plans for the fu-
ture include an ice machine in
Belk dorm on an experimental
basis. He also hopes to give
each freshman dorm $50.00 for
a party. He feels that with a

the president or whoever he
designates to approve such char-
tering, Spencer said.

The trustees also deleted the
rection in the by-laws which
eaid that at least 50 ver cent
of the faculty must be Presby-
terians. However, the trustees
left intact the statement that
a faculty member must be a
Christian in order ‘.o receive
tenure.

The trustees hope to approve
the final draft at their spring
meeting.

Concerning the new library,
the trustees passed a resolution
of appreciation to E. H. Little
for his additional contribution
of $500,000.

The trustees however eapress-
ed dissatisfaction with outward
appearance of the proposed
plans and directed the archi-
tects to prepare additional
sketches before February.

On the subject of coeducation,
Hall said that the board was
continuing to study the issue.
“I believe in coeducation, and
I believe it to be a sound means
of education,’ said Hall ‘‘but
the board hesitates to make a
decision while legislation con-
cerning this matter is still in
pending in Congress."

Hall also expressed concern
about the means of financing
coeducation as well as David-
son's relationship with Queens
College.

In expanding the Governance
Committee, the trustees in a
resolution directed it to con-
tinue its study ‘within the
framework of the Charter and
by-laws, of all aspects of col-
lege governance, including its
review of faculty and student
constitutional documents."’

In other action the board al-
so heard explanation of the de-
ferred giving program, and
then authorized the develop-
staff to begin implementation
of the program.

Little Contributes $500,000

F. H. Little of New York, a
native of Mecklenburg County,
N. C., and former president and
board chairman of  Colgate-
Palmolive, has given Davidson
College a second $500,000 chal-
lenge contribution for the col-
lege’s new $4 million library
named in his honor.

In 1969 the college claimed
Little’s first challenge gift of
$500,000 after raising $1,500,000
in matching funds. Now the
college will be seeking to raise
that amount again to match
Little’s second challenge gift by
the time the library is com-
pleted in 1974.

‘Initially Davidson was think-
ing in terms of a library of
60,000 square feet at a cost of
$2 million,” explained College
President Samuel R. Spencer

Jr. ‘‘As long-range plans for the
college developed, it became
clear that future needs demand-
ed a structure of 100,000 square
feet, estimated to cost about $4
million.

“The E. H. Little Library will
be our most important building

since Chambers (the main class-
room building) was constructed
in the late 1920s,’ the presi-
dent continued.

‘“‘Mr. Little’s gracious willing-
ness to start us so magnificent-
ly on the final phase of fund-
raising is thoroughly character-
istic of him, Because of his vi-

sion and generosity, Davdison
will have a library second to
none.”

Spencer announced the gift at
a joint meeting on campus of
trustees, faculty, staff and stu-
dents on Thursday. The group
had gathered to hear the pre-
sentation of the library planning
committee, architects and a
landscape _ design, concerning
the appearance and functions
of the new library.

Little is the largest individ-
ual contributor in Davidson’s
history.

The E. H. Little dormitory on
campus bears his name, as will
the new library. His gifts con-
tributed substantially toward
the construction of the Dana
Science Building and the Cun-
ningham Fine Arts Center.
