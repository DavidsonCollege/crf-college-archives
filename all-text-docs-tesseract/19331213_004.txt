commonly known as “rabbit fever.”

The disease was contracted while the
patient was cleaning a wild rabbit he
had shot. Rarely are cases of this
kind fatal, only fourteen having been
reported. However, this case showed
a rapid invasion of the lung tissue by
the bacillus tularemia, and death came
about three weeks after the onset.

Dr. Gudger graduated at Davidson
College in 1925, took his medical work

Sinclair Lewis Topic of
Eumenian Society Talk

A paper on the life of Sinclair
Lewis, a short story, “The Victim,”
and a discussion of current events was
the order of the Eumenian Literary
Society program which was given at
the meeting last Tuesday night.

John D. Allen discussed the life of
Sinclair Lewis and showed how it had
affected his writing. “The Idea of a
‘Arrowsmith’,” Allen
brought out, “was due to the fact that
Lewis’ brother was a doctor.” “The
unorthodox character of the hero,” he
said, “ was a revelation of the real Sin-
clair Lewis.”

One of the cameras was tried
at the Wake Forest game, and
worked all right. It is believed
that the showing of the pictures
to the alumni will do more to-
ward increasing their interest in
the college than any speeches
that could be made.

The association desires to pur-

chase a 16 mm. camera, and
would like to get one as cheaply
as possible. Any al know-
