SFC WHEAT

SFC. Charles B. Wheat of the
Davidson College R.O.T.C. Depart-
ment entered the army at the Fort
McPherson, Ga. induction center
on February 6, 1943. He was as-
signed to Camp Pendelton, Va. for
his basic training in the 34th Coast
Artillery Battalion. He remained
there for fourteen months.

He then went to Camp Gruber,
Oklahoma for infantry basic train-
ing with the Rainbow Division of
the 42nd Infantry Regiment. After
this he went to jump school at Fort
Benning, Georgia where he remain-
ed for nine weeks, April, May, and
June of 1944. From there he went
to E.T.O. in England of the 82nd
Airborne Division, right before the
Holland invasion. Wheat made the
Holland invasion, and remained in
the Netherlands for 59 days.

He stayed with the 82nd for the
remainder of the year 1044 and
went with them through three ma-
jor campaigns. After he left Hol-
land he was engaged in the Battle
of the Bulge when the Germans
broke through. At that time he
was wounded and went back to
England to the hospital where he
stayed for three months.

He then went back to his outfit
and made the last major campaign
of which the 82nd was a part. This
was the crossing of the Elbe River
and the consequential surrender of
the German 21Ist Army to the 82nd
Airborne Division. SFC. Wheat
then went into Berlin and remain-
ed there for three months in the
occupation troops.

He was then sent home on
points. He re-enlisted after a nine-
ty day furlough and re-joined the
82nd at Fort Bragg, N. C. He re-
mained there until the outbreak of
the Korean War.

He then volunteered for the Air-
borne Rangers and was sent to
Fort Benning for training. During
this period he took ranger train-
ing at Fort Benning, jungle train-
ing in Florida, and mountain and
ski training in Colorado. He was
then sent to Korea with the Eighth
Ranger Company. This company
joined the 24th Infantry Division.
Its duty was primarily patrolling
behind enemy lines. Sfc. Wheat
was in combat for nine months,
after which time the ranger com-
panies disbanded. He then went to
Japan where he became a member
of the 187th Regimental Combat

“Each program is one-half hour
long and consists of two sketches
of 10 minutes cach. Every week the
judges select “the best actor of
the week,” who is asked to return
for another performance.

Mr. White is willing to arrange
auditions at the College if enough
students are interested. He also
adds that WBT will pay $5. for
any story-idea suitable for the pro-
gram. These sketches may be love
stories, “who dunnits,” fantasies,
kid stories, or suspense yarns.

All students interested are ask-
ed to come by the Union office.

She was born on May 11, 1983
in Orange, California, and receiv-
ed her first experience on the Al
Jarvis Show on Radio Station
KLAC in Hollywood. At first with
a small band, she left this group
in order to spend more time with
her vocal studies.

Her break in the entertainment
field came when she was invited to
sing at a party given in honor of
Harry James. After hearing her
for only a minute, James decided
to feature her as top vocalist in
his band. It was at this point that
Sam Donahue, after taking over
the Billy May Orchestra, offered
her the position of featured vocal-
ist in the outfit. :

Near East Society in New York,
who came to Davidson with Mr.
Miller, described the educational
problem of the Near East as that
which offers greatest opportuni-
ties to American. students and
teachers. About 60 students (40)
men are selected each year to
serve as teachers at Robert College
in Istanbul, Turkey, the Universi-
ty of Beirut in Labanon, and Ath-
ens College and Anatolia College
in Greece.

The greatest openings for men
men with 9 B. A. or B. S. degree,
with no experience in teaching, are
for the instruction of English lan-
guage and literature, mathematics,
and science on a secondary level.
Mr. Whitman, who himself taught
at Robert College in Istanbul, said
that the instruction is not entirely
academic, for there is a great
practical necessity of inculcating
geography, history, philosophy, and
the foundation of Western thought
along with regular subjects.

The majority of students at each
Near Eastern educational institu-
tion are natives of the respec-
tive countries. All instruction is
delivered in English, though it is
advisable for one participating in
this program to learn the native
language in order to understand
fully individual problems.

The pay for the required three-
year term is $1,000 per year, plus

The Ford Foundation is again
offering Foreign Study and Re-
search Fellowships for persons
who wish to become competent in
the cultures, histories, and current
problems of Asia and the Middle
East, the Soviet Union and East
Europe areas. College seniors may
apply for these awards.

Previous study of the area or
of a language of the area is not
required to qualify. Stipends will
be determined by an individual’s
need. All applications must be filed
before January 7, 1955.

Further information may be had
from Professor G. L. Abernethey.
Application blanks are available
from the Ford Foundation Foreign
Study and Research Fellowship
Program, 477 Madison Avenue,

Washington University

The Graduate School of Wash-
ington University in St. Louis is
offering a number of fellowships
for graduate study in various de-
partments,

The stipends range from $450 to
$2200. A number of University Tui-
tion Scholarships which provide

stipends equivalent to tuition are

also available.

Holders of fellowships and scho-
larships are not required to teach
or render laboratory assistance.

Application forms may be secur.
ed by writing to the Office of the
Graduate School of Arts and Sci-
ences, Washington University, St.
Louis, Mo.

Ohio State University

The Graduate School of the Ohio
State University has announced a

of-state tuition scholarships are al-
so available.

If a finger were to be pointed at
any one factor that made the dif-
ference between the two clubs, it
would have to be in the passing
attack. Whenever yardage was
needed, Boyle, the leading ground-
gainer in the Southern Conference,
dropped back and hit his men. Yet
when Davidson passed, men broke
through, resulting in bad losses on
more than one occasion. There
were also several dropped passes.

Outstanding for Davidson in the
line were Petersen, Gramley, New-

laundry, room, board, and trans-
portation to and from the Near
East. This salary corresponds
roughly with the usual beginning
annual pay of teachers in secon-
dary education in the United
States, $2,800. While the financial
remuneration is not great, Mr.
Whitman pointed out, it is suffi-
cient to cover travel interests in
vacation periods and local expens-
es. He said that he lived comfort-
ably and well during his Near
Eastern sojourn, and still had
money enough to bring home with
him such items as Bohara and Tur-
kish rugs, an inlaid ivory box, and
a quantity of Damascus silk.
Further information concerning
teaching opportunities in the Near
East may be obtained from Dr.
George L. Abernethy, who worked
with the International Relations
Club and the YMCA in presenting

Davidson played a rough-and-

beat them, 34-0, last year. Un-
doubtedly, many spectators walk-

mistakes, the score would have
been quite different. With no one
injured badly enough to miss this
Saturday’s homecoming game, the
“Big Come Back,” featuring the
Wildcats, should get back into the
