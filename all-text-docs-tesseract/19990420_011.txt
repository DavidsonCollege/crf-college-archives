THE DAVIDSONIAN

Baker & Gibson

The men’s track team had their last “prac-
tice” meet before the 1999 Southern Conference
Championships this past weekend, as fourteen of
its members traveled to Boone, NC for the Appa-
lachian State Open. Competing with athletes from
seven other schools, the men performed excep-
tionally well yet again, despite the cool tempera-
ture and strong wind gusts.

Leading the way with undoubtedly the best
races of the day were freshman star Dan Gibson
and senior co-captain Stan Baker. Gibson solidi-
fied his standing among the best runners in the
league by taking first in the 800m Saturday in a
near-school record time of 1:54.87. His perfor-
mance was only .14 seconds off the existing mark,
and placed him in prime position for an All-
Conference selection in two events this weekend
(including the 1500m, where he is currently ranked
7"), Baker crushed his personal record (PR) en
route toa: 58.39 in the 400m hurdles, good enough
for 4" place. His race was a perfect example of the
breakthrough season this Wildcat club has wit-
nessed since the first indoor practice in January.

Baker also led the team in the 200m, sprinting
his way to a: 23.64. Freshman Grant Bleecher
continued his late-season surge by running :23.74,

while John Moore completed the
Davidson trio with atime of :24.44.
Michael Albert once again led the
men in the 400m, placing 5" and
running his PR in that event (:51.59).

The 800m saw Jay Jahnes lay
even stronger claims toa spot among

the conference’s top rookies as he

put in another solid race (1:57.6, 2"
place) despite an ankle injury suf-
fered during the week leading up to
the meet. Jonathan Fly followed in
2:10.3, Steve Johnston ran another
comeback race in 2: 14.9, while fresh-
man Miles Harmon finished behind
“Snake” in 2:17.6

Brent Ferrell recorded another
impressive effort in the 1500m
(4:06.7, 5" place) as he gears up for
the team’s second two-event All-
Conference attempt. Ferrell is
ranked 3™ in the 3000m steeple-
chase and 2" in the 5000m. Thomas
McElveen closely followed Ferrell
in4:10.9, while Paul Irwin and Keith
Gordon ran 4:19.1 and 4:27.1, re-
spectively.

The 4x100m relay team of
Baker, Addam Marcotte, Albert, and
Moore sprinted their way to a:45.37,
with Moore gunning down the UNC-
Greensboro anchor leg in the pro-
cess, giving the relay team a4" place
finish.

The 1999 installment of the
SoCon Championships will he help
April 23-24 at East Tennessee State
in Johnson City, TN.
