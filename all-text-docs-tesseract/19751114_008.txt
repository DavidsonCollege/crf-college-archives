Vender Man

The figure curls against-his cart

and puts his ware to hungry palms.
Like something wrong he forms a bent,
a life collapsed against three wheels
and sauce-aired pots of the city mouth.
Ancient knuckles dip and weave so
swift with tongs and flash! with
angler’s skill sweep pink-steamed
phallics from embryonic pits to

cozy nestle in soft brown buns,

those soft brown ones.

Distant eyes now closed (no need to see)
the wooden tool like painter’s

torch slap slap along the smoky

crease with golden-spot of spice,
tomato-red delight, and just

a touch (if ya’ please) of

crispy-cut wet green and onion dice.
Ain’t it nice! little ones say,

and beam despite nose that runs

and hands-that fun, feeling,
warped-wood sides or iron-rim

wheels or plucking fast at

The New Jersey Balloon ’55.

And beneath the beach-lost |

spread and shade of canvas frayed
toothless gums and soft-lined

face spit and glow as

plunging sun*coaxed him home,

the confusion of curves just

collected all and plodded off. Together.
Where? We knew never (he never said)
but always, like well-seasoned god

he was there once more curled

and buttoned to three wheels,

mustard steam, and ’55 making

pink phallic change and endless scenes
of a child’s, man’s, woman’s dreams.
