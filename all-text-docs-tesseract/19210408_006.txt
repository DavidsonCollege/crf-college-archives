THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 8, 1921.

HENRY ELLIOT SHEPHERD
WORTHY DAVIDSON
ALUMNUS
—_—_——

The subject of this sketch was born
at Fayetteville, N. C, January 17, 1844.
His father was Jesse George Shepherd,
one of the most accomplished lawyers,
jurists, and gentlemen that North Caro,
lina has produced. His mother was:
Catherine Dobbin, sister of J. C. Dob-
bin, Secretary of the Navy, in the cab-
inet of Mr. Pierce.

At the age of seven Mr. Shepherd en-
tered the school of Miss Mary Weeks
on Haymount. From here he was trans-
ferred to the Donaldson Academy where
he was prepared for college. When he
was but 14 Mr. Shepherd entered the
Freshman class at Davidson College.
The call to training for military service |
was too strong, however, and he follow- |
ed his teacher, Major D. H. Hill, to the,
Military Acedamy which they estab-
lished in Charlotte. |

He was scarcely 17 when
blast blew, but he was soon in the field
of service. His first position was that |
of instructor to raw recruits in Raleigh,
N. C. In the spring of 1862 he was ad-
vanced to the rank of first lieutenant in
the 43d N. C. troops and was probably
at the time of his appointment, the
youngest commissioned officer in the
armies of the Confederacy. At Gettys-
burg he was dangerously wounded and
taken captive. After a tong and cruel
captivity he found his way to his deso-
late North Carolina home where the
smokes were still rising from Sherman's
fires.

Soon after the close of the war he
taught school in Louisburg, N. C. From
there he went to Baltimore, where at
the age of 24 he was elected to the
chair of History and English in the City
College. This trust he resigned in 1882
to assume the presidency of the College
of Charleston, S.C. He caused five years
of wonderful progress there, and then
returned to Baltimore to give his entire
time to writing. Many noble volumes
have been the result of his efforts,

Mr. Shepherd has gained eminent suc-
cess throughout the United States as a
lecturer. In religion he is a Presbyte-
rian, and in all his sentiments, sympa-
thies, convictions, and ideals he is heart-
ily Southern. He has in contemplation
ior the future an even greater work than
has rewarded his past efforts. David-
son will continue to watch and hope for
unlimited success—as she has in the
past—to crown the labors of her worthy
son, Henry Elliot Shepherd.
