How I Survived the

Boston Marathon

_... and Feeling Like
An Unplugged Hoover

When I reached the first water stop on
the Boston Marathon course, my mind
drifted back to.a concert I had seen sev-
eral nights before. At that concert I wit-
nessed for the first time what is com-
monly called slam dancing, a type of ac-
tivity in which human beings deliberate-

ly smash into each other, supposedly for

fun. You may not think there is a con-
nection between slam dancing and ma-
rathoning, but then you. have probably
never ‘seen hundreds of runners all
greedily reaching for a few cups of wa-

ter either. The race may have brought

out the animal in many of the partici-
pants, but then perhaps only mad dogs
and .marathoners run aroiad in the
noonday sun.

The noonday sun was in fact a major
concern for most of this year’s seven
thousand participants. .Raceday was
bright and humid, the temperature hav-
ing‘ mercilessly climbed to seventy de-
grees by the start. Great weather tor

- those watching, but to most marathon-

ers such a day is about as desirable as
malaria, When I learned in the early

-miles that I could not even count on

much shade along the course I tried to
placate my fears of death or, even
worse, dropping out by:taking in fluid
and slowing down considerably.

To justify to myself the change in
pace, I decided to concentrate’ on the
spectacle of the Boston Marathon. And
what'a spectacle it was. All along the
twenty six. miles of the course, some

two million spectators were lined up to -

watch, offering to the runners oranges,
water, encouragement, and advice (“Go
faster, you.can still catch Salazar!) The
themes from “Rocky” and “Chariots of
Fire” were blasting out of apartment
windows in an attempt to inspire the

weary. The highlight of the race for me
was at Wellesley College where the stu-

pretty important.

dents lined the roadside screaming en-
couragement to the runners. I found my-
self not only running faster but also
waving and shouting in return, although
the roar of the spectators was so great
that I could not hear what I was yelling.
Moments like this tend to make one feel
Unfortunately by
twenty one miles and the end‘of the in-
famous Newton hills, any feelings of
omnipotence I’ ‘may’ ‘have had’ ‘suc-
combed totally to the harsh realities of
the marathon.

Imagine, if you can; that you are a
Hoover vacuum cleaner. As long as you
are turned on, you can cruise back and
forth across the carpet, sucking up dust
and grime. But when someone pulls the
plug all your energy iis dissipated and
you are no longer able to traverse the rug

looking for ground-in dirt. I felt much
like an unplugged Hoover after I passed

the twenty-one mile mark. The differ-
_ence ‘between runner and vacuum

though is that the marathoner somehow
keeps on going after the circuit is brok-
en. Keeping that distinction in mind, I
struggled onward and finally reached
the finish line a broken man, having al-
ternated running and walking for the last
three miles.

The heat, combined with my insuffi-
cient training, had taken its toll. I had
run. my worst marathon: by fourteen

minutes, in contrast to Davidson’s other
"representative. in the race, Marian Hill,

— re

Half an hour after the race I was al-
ready planning my next assault on the
marathon. Only next time I hope to run
farther and faster before the plug is
pulled.
