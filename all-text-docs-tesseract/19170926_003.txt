Vhe Eumenean Literary Society held
its first meeting last Saturday evening at
7:15. This being the first meeting «!
the year, a full program was not carned
out.

The subject for debate was: “‘*Resolv-
ed, That negro troops should be train: .|
in the South.” The affirmati ce was up
held by R. L. Liston and §. ‘1. Met ,
the negative by A. S. Potts and EF. A.
Woods.

The main points in the argument of
the affirmative were that the negro is
better suited to the Southern climate;
that the Southern whites are his friends,
while the Northerners do not know the
negro and consequently cannot tolerate
him.

The negative contended that the so-
cial prejudice of the Southern white man
against the negro will not tolerate the
presence of thousands of arrogant negro
troops in our Southern cities.

‘The first speeches were good — and
showed the results of thorough prepara-
tion. The .rebuttals were spirited on
hoth sides. .

Owing to the change to six class days
a week, a motion was made that only
one meeting be held each week. “This
motion was tabled until the next meet-
ing.

Te was announced that the Freshman
Society would hold its first meeting
Mondav evening. September 24. Quite
a number of the Freshmen have signified
their intention ef joining this’ society.

The first meeting of the Phi Society
was held last Saturday night. The ques-
tion for debate was: Resolved, that negro
troops should be trained in the South. A
lively and witty debate ensued, in which
the negative won.

Alexander. Davis and Hunter, for the
affirmative, showed that the negro shoul
be trained in the South because of (1)
climatic conditions; (2) economic con-
ditions; (3) and his adaptability to learn
more quickly in the South; Calhoun,
McClure and Currie, for the negative.
showed (1) that the negro would have
a demoralizing effect upon the South;
(2) the enmity of the Southerners to-
wards them, and (3) that Porto Rica
should be the place instead of the South.
. W. C. Neal gave an interesting ora-
tion on “Why America Declared War
on Germans,” while M. A. Siske gave
a verv original as well as a witty talk
on “What Can Literature Do for Me.”

G. McDonald was elected the janitor

A LETTER TO STUDENTS
FROM A. P. SAUNDERS

A. P, Saunders, 18, who was elected
president of the student body for this
year, suffered a very Serious tracture of
the leg while in the mountains of North
Carolina during the early part of the
summer. He was taken to the Biltmore
Hospital. at Biltmore, N. C.. and after
eight weeks or more of varying degrees
of pain, he was moved to St. Luke's
Hospital, Richmond. Va. He had hoped
to be here at the opening, as appears in
his letter, but the injury did not im-
prove as had been expected. ft must
have been a great disappointment not
to have been here at the opening. but
he shows his splendid spirit in the fol-
owing letter:

(Very) “Base” Hospital.
Bilemore, N. C.. Aug. 27. 0907.
Gentlemen: Loam glad of a chance
to say hello! to the old and new boys.
As most of you know, [| was pretty well
broken up by a fall early in the summer,
without having the satisfaction of feel-
ee that | owas doing something for my
country. Peace is sometimes as bad as
war, as several of our leader statesmen
have set forth. Have lain in one po-
sition with “limb” suspended for seven
weeks today, with varving degrees of
pain to remind me that [am still here.

However, | should not worry, for |
am on.a par with vou all, as we are all
looking forward to the opening of col
lege on the rath, You don't know how
much yaw really appreciate Davidson
until you feel that there is a chance of
your not getting back. [It should be a
great year for us, and we who may re-
turn are indeed fortunate. Here's hop-
ing we have a bigger Fresh class than
ever. Looking forward with = more
pleasure than you can imagine to secing
you all on the 13th, although [ may avy
cclf have to came on a cot,

With best wishes to all.

Yours very sincerely,
Peri SAUNDERS.

An English militant crusader strolled

milking a caw. “How is it that you are
not at the front, young man?”

“Because. ma'am.” answered — the
milker, “there ain't no milk ar that
