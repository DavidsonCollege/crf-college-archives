speak. It takes an entirely different
set of enzymes to break down a
fruit like an orange than it does to
break down a berry. It’s just better
for digestion and is associated with
proper technique for weight loss.
The main groups are 1) berries 2)
citrus 3) fibrous, i.e. pears, apples,
etc. 4) peaches, apricots, and fruits
of this nature. A variety of vege-
tables is also beneficial. Carrots
everyday won’t hurt, but aren’t
nearly as good as a little green,
leafy veggies and legumes (yes,
beans) thrown in there with them.

Three servings of milk. Milk
is not high in fat, thereby not con-
tributing to high cholesterol if you
drink the right kind. Whole milk is
justnasty. You're not losing outon

any thing but pure fats by switch-
ing to skim milk. If you find your-
self thinking that skim milk is
nothing but white water, try going
down in degrees. Start with two
percent, move to one percent, then
try skim milk again. Try whole
milk again as well.

Sixty to seventy percent of the
calories in ice cream come from fat
with an average of seventy milli-
grams of cholesterol per ounce.
Icecream is fine, of course, if you’re
not taking in a lot of fat from other
sources. You still might consider
getting frozen yogurt next time
you’re at Carolina Cones, though.
Everybody needs three servings of
milk, but women really need them.

Only seven percentofourage group '

gets the amount needed, so unless
something changes, LizandIaren’t
going to be the only short people
around here thanks to osteoporo-
sis.

One serving of meats. Roast

beef isn’ tas good asa turkey, butif
it’s lean it’s not a big deal either
way. Corn beef is nasty stuff; as are
hot dogs. They are very much
processed foods which means the
fats and salts have been added
before youeven getnear them with
bacon slices. Poultry and fish are
the best, but pork, beef, or lamb
three times a week is fine (espe-
cially if it contains no more than
fifteen percent fat).

All of the things above are
things you should always try toeat.
In addition you can throw in your
processed foods and empty calo-
ries (alcohol, candy, pop). The good
thing about maintaining the regi-
men above in some capacity is that

you will naturally consume less of —

these extras, There are some nev-
ers, as well. Avoid real butter, an
excess amount of cream cheese
(those little tubs are way toomuch),
palm, coconut,and animal fat based
oils like the plague.

unique hobby. As a veteran balloonist, it is the power to make people
smile that keeps me coming back. *’

Balloonists’ Prayer
The winds have welcomed you with softness
The sun has blessed you with its warm hands
You have flown so high and so well
That God has joined you in your laughter
And set you gently back
Into the loving arms of Mother Earth..
