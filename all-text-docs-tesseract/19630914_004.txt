The College Union's next
i] planned social function is an
j|,“open house” dance to be held
‘l'in the Morrison Room after the
i] Citadel-Davidson football game
here on Sept. 28, according to
Union President Staff Warren.

The Sept. 21 function at Con-
verse College that had been
planned for Davidson freshmen
has been called off.

The open house dance is to be
the first of similar dances after
other home football and basket-
ball games. Union Director C.
Shaw Smith said, “Tentative
Friday dances have been sched-
uled—perhaps in conjunction
with other week-end activities.”

The Union is also consider-
ing a forma! dance to follow
the Homecoming concert.
Smith said thet plans depend
upon the amount of interest
shown in such a dance. Con
cert artist Carlos Montoya will
be invited for the dance if it
is held.

Entertainment for some of
the coming events is expected to
be provided by student musi-
cians. Sid Farrar’s jazz group is
planning a special concert and
Mike Hunter's combo plans to
play for some freshman get-to-
gethers and possibly in the
cafeteria occasionally.

Smith said that considerable
talent had been discovered: a-
mong the freshmen. Ventriloqu-
ist David McCorkle plans to per-
form for a Club International
. | floor show.

The Union Social Committee,
headed by Wic Cooney, is plan-
ning to work .through and with
the Freshman Council in sched-
uling social events. “And there
will be additional freshmen on
this year's Union Cafeteria
Committee,” promised Director
Smith.

Bridge tournaments will again
be held in the Union, and mas-
ter points can be given this year.
Other fall activities ia the Uniop
include the Roundtable Pro-
gram, the fashion show and the
annual Christmas party.

Faculty Adds 18 Members

the Union after the $80.000 en-
largement project is completed.

Smith said, “I can make no
promises about any kind of
opening date for the new build-
ing, but when it opens it will be
beautiful, wonderful and serv-
iceable. The added space will
allow us to explore more of the
needs and interests of the stud-
ents.”

The new, air-conditioned
building will house the Knovel
Knook, the textbook store, the
game room and the Student
Store. There sre to be addi-
fiona! billiard and ping pong
tables for the game room, and
the new Student Store will be
large enough to hendle more

goods, including sports equip-
ment.

In addition the new wing will
house a vending machine' room
that will remain open 24 hours a
day.

The transfer of the Student
Store and game room to the new
‘building will make room for ad-
ditional tables in the cafeteria
and two more private dining
rooms can be added, Smith said.

Tentative services in the new
Union wing include selling
records and lending prints of
famous pictures.

Smith said it was his hope
that the move to the new build-
ing could be executed during
the Thanksgiving holidays.

“Crossroads Africa,” and the

100 men in America under 40
years of age outstanding in “the
take-over generation.”

by him have appeared in Setur-
day Review, Parents’ Magazine,

seven “freedom riders” arrested
in Montgomery, Ala. Local
courts found the riders guilty of

unlawful assembly and disturb-

ance of the peace after they had
violated local laws pertaining to
bus transportation and restaur-
ant seating.

In July of this year, he was
arrested in Baltimore at a seg-
regated amusement park as a

Reality Tests Class Rooms

Prelude to massacre? No, just
160 ROTC cadets receiving in-
struction in personal combat.
The place was Fort Bragg, N.
C., and the class, “Use of the
Bayonet,” was one of many
courses taught during the “Six
Weeks War.” Most of the cadets
were blissfully ignorant that
such ancient, unsophisticated
means of killing still found ap-
plication. Yet after several
hours of concentrated practice,
they, too, had. qualified as but-
chers first class.

Other programs scheduled
during the ROTC Camp period
left the potential officer with
hours of “live” range firing to
his credit and a working know-
ledge of infantry weapons
from the M-l1 to the 8lmm
mortar. Imparting an  under-
standing of small unit tactics
was equally as important to the
cadet as the fundamentals of
marksmanship. Thus, tactics in-
struction included everything
from recon patrols to tank-in-
fantry teams in the attack.
There was even a night compass
course ¢o separate the men from
the boys . . . which it did.

BY BOB ADAMS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Barracks life gave everyone a
sample of the enlisted man’s
fare and a birdseye view of the
confusion which underlies the
glossy veneer of military pre-
cision.

“Alpha Company will wear
cartridge belts to chow this
morning!” call the platoon ser-
geants. Five minutes before
“fall in” you hear the platoon
sergeants directing ‘Revision:
all cadets will wear cartridge
belts, with canteens, with rolled
panchos to chow.” Just as the
command “fall in” echoes
through the empty barracks
street, the frantic cadet leaders
are shouting “Cartridge belts
only to chow! No canteens, and
panchos folded!”

Immediately chaos results as
cursing cadets mill about in the
streets, unrolling panchos and
removing canteens. Meanwhile,
the cadet company commander
has just flushed a few leader-
ship points.

The Davidson cadet found
that barracks life acquainted
him with more than mere con-
fusion and the Spartan exist-
ence. No one can soon forget

At Fort Bragg Sweatshop

“Kill! kill! kil! .. .” the scream reverberated through the bleachers that steamy
July afternoon. Sweat streaked the taut muscles of the Airvorne Rangers as they
jabbed fixed bayonets toward the cadets who cowered in their seats.

the sonorous cadence counted
“two, fower . . . two, thuree,
fower” by the VMI cadets. Long
will he remember the Hampton
Institute command “Toon lead-
ers, take charge o’ yo’ ‘toons and’
carry out de prescribed drill fo’
‘de day.” No less vivid will be
memories of “back sink” and
“outside man” duties performed
while enduring the KP required
of each cadet.

As well as the targets, brass,
tactics, drill, sweat and work of
summer camp, most cadets will
remember the 82nd Airborne
Club, the escape to Fayetteville’s
Holiday Inn on weekends, the
Sunday afternoons spent pool-
side at the Officers Club, or a
weekend trip to beach. These
were some of the amenities that
made camp life bearable.

ROTC Camp was a sorry sub-
stitute for a vacation one might
have enjoyed on the coast or in
Europe, and Army pay did not
approach $100 per week. At
Fort Bragg, however, the cadet
could put his leadership train-
ing to a practical test and realize

that it takes more than = six

weeks to make a good officer.
