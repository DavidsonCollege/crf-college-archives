We're On Our Way

If Lefty Driesell is strutting around the campus this
week with an ear to ear grin similar to one a proud new
father might wear, he has plenty of reasons. Satur-
day, Fred Hetzel, a 6-8 high school basketball All-Ameri-
can from Washington, D. C., _ a full grant-in-aid to
attend Davidson coming f

“This will get our basketball wheel rolling,” proclaimed
Assistant Coach Joe Hunt, referring to Hetzel’s decision.

Hunt, who had been highly instrumental in Driesell’s
recruiting program that promises to make Davidson Col-
lege a  eskethalt powerhouse in the very near future,
cannot say enough about Hetzel.

“He’s the finest high
school ball oe I saw this
past winter, lares Hunt,
“and that includes players
in the majority of the east-
ern states — Kentucky, In-
diana, Pennsylvania, Virgin-
ia, Maryland, North Caro-
lina, and a few others.”

“He'll be the core of a tre-
mendous basketball team
here,” says the freshman
mentor, who is anxiously —
awaiting the chance to han-
dle next year’s frosh team,
which should be the greatest
in the history of the school.

Hetzel chose Davidson
over 80 colleges that had
given him scholarship of-
fers. His outstanding record
explains his many offers. He

was All-Metropolitan for three years in Washington,
and made three high school All-American teams _ this
past season. He has never averaged below 20 points a
game in his career, during which he amassed 1210
points for. Landon prep school.

But Driesell isn’t primarily interested in Hetzel as a
scorer. “We're going to have plenty of other boys that
can score,” says the young coach. “Hetzel’s the big man
we need; he can get the ball for us.’

Meanwhile, Driesell continues arranging his schedule
for next season. Newcomers to the list include Duke,
George Washington, and Alabama. Catawba, Pfeiffer,
and VPI are being dropped.

Martin Elected Captain

D. G. Martin has been elected Captain of next year’s
basketball team by his teammates. Martin, a rising senior,
played in spots this past season, and is noted for his
hustle and rebounding ability.

His best performance came in the second Furman
game at Greenville, S. C., when he scored 12 points,
grabbed seven rebounds, and put a tight defensive job
on the Paladin’s Gerald Glur.

Coach Driesell commented, “I think the boys made a
real good choice in D. G. He has an excellent attitude,
tremendous desire and hustle, and will be a good team
leader.”

Eberhart Gutted It Out

Last Saturday the track team ran away with the David-
son Relays with 76 points, followed by Lenoir Rhyne’s
23.

Many Wildcats were truly outstanding that afternoon—
Linton Wray pole vaulted 12 feet, 1 inch; Hugh Murray
broad jumped 21 feet, 10% inches; and John Chiles
hopped-skipped-and jumped 43 feet, 6% inches.

But we feel the greatest performance of all was put
on by Dick Eberhart, a member of the fleet 440-yard
relay team.

It seems that Eberhart, who was spiked on the heel
as he took the baton from a teammate, ran his 110-yard
leg with a six stitch gash in his foot. He could have quit
as soon as he was stepped on, and no one would have said
a thing. But he didn't, he ran his part, and Davidson won.

Wednesday to cast their lot

row.

Although the local netmen
claim a record that can boast
only four wins, Coach Semi
Mintz is hardly skeptical. To the
contrary, confident would be a
much better adjective for the
youthful Davidson mentor.

CITADEL FAVORED

In so far as records go, Mintz
will concede the favorite posi-
tion to The Citadel. But for
George Washington, defending
conference champ, he predicts
only a fourth. And Davidson,
in Mintz’s opinion, should finish
better than last year’s third.

With no qualms whatsoever.
Mintz prognosticates definite
victories in the number three

jdoubles match and the number j

six singles match. In number
one doubles and number five
singles, he calculates the: odds
at “over a fifty-fifty chance.”

“Of course a lot will be de-
termined by the drawing after

we get down there,”’ adds Mintz.
“We were overscheduled this
year,” continues Mintz. “We've

got a better team than our re
cord would indicate.”
ORR NUMBER ONE

Top-seeded Doug Orr will lead
the ‘Cat netmen with Bobby
Austell in the number two posi-
tion and Finley Lee in the num-
ber three position. Nick Coop-

Showalter Elected
IMAC President;
Fraser New Veep

Graham Showalter was elected
president of next year’s Intra-
mural Athletic Council at Wed-
nesday night's meeting.

Other new officers are:
Keith Fraser, vice-president;
and John Boylin, secretary.

Showalter, who succeeds Mike
Van Doeren, is a rising senior,
and is a member of Sigma Chi.
Fraser, a rising junior, belongs
to Pi Kappa Alpha, while Boy-
lin is a rising junior and a
member of Pi Kappi Phi.

Other Council representatives
for 1961-62 are as follows: ATO
—Paul Duvall; Beta — Steve
Clark; KA — John Sharpe; Kap-
pa Sig — Bob Hord; Independ-
ent — Al Mullen; Phi Delt —
Buddy Rives; Phi Gam — Mims
Rogers; SAE — Tony McNay;
Sig Ep — Forrest Roles; and
Sigma Nu — Buddy Brauch.

In addition, the Council com-
pleted its work on revising the
rules and regulations of I-F
sports. One of the big rule
changes concerning eligibility is
that a freshman who earns a
numeral in a sport will be el-
igible for that sport in the LF
league the following year, if he
decides not to go out for the
varsity.

have compiled the best regular

According to Mintz, ‘“There’s

the tournament. I think it’s tre-

RIDING 3 GAME STREAK

their 8-13-1 overall mark.

Coach Tom Stevens’ crew is
currently riding a three game
winning streak, and has triumph-
ed five times in the last seven
games.

Richmond is “a real good
team” according to Stevens.
The Spiders are currently
leading the conference, due
mainly to Charlie Revere, an
All-Conference pitcher a year
ago. At the plate, the Spiders
are paced by outfielders Tom
Booker and Bob Stewart.

Against Richmond, Stevens
plans to start Tommy Hamilton
on the mound. Hamilton now has
a 5-5 record.

George Washington should be
an easier foe for the 'Cats. The
Colonials, led mainly by sopho-
mores, are strong in pitching
and in the field, but don’t have
many good hitters. All-Confer-
ence Dennis Hill, a stumpy
southpaw, will probably hurl
against the locals.

ers met VMI in a doublehead-

in the first game, but David-
son lost, 4-1.

In the nightcap, Tommy Har-
ris stymied the Keydets on six
hits and got credit for the 5-1
Davidson victory.

This past Tuesday afternoon
the squad played The Citadel in
the first of a two-day series. It
proved to be a long afternoon
for both sides, as Davidson pre-
vailed in « three and a half hour
marathon, 20-19.

Citadel jumped off to a 9-0
lead after two innings, but the
‘Cats came right back in the
third, when they knocked All-
Conference Dick Almes out of
the box in an eight run merry-
go-round. Harris thumped a
homer and a double during the
inning.

In the bottom of the ninth,
Citadel once again had a com-
fortable lead, 19-13. But the
never-say-die Davidsonians trip-
ped seven runs across the plate
as The Citadel machine fell
apart.

“It was a wild and wodly

marathon!”

Meanwhile, I-F softball and
tennis action continued. In Mon-
day’s softball action, the Sigma
Nus forfeited to the Kappa
Sigs, and the Sigma Chis down-
ed the Betas, 16-12. All other
games were rained out.

beaten ranks, 24-20; the SAE’s

just seven hits, Harris pick-

The Harry Smith-Tommy Tut-

clicked four times, and Tuttle

trips to the plate. Other stick
men were Ed Hines (2 for

“Without a doubt, it was our
best game,” declared Stevens
proudly.
