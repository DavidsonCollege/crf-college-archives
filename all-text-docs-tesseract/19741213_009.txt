Most of Federico Fellini’s movies
are plagued with splits between the
content and the form. The content is
usually so much weaker than the form °
that it necessarily drags behind.

"8%" Ys such a pyrotechnical
masterpiece formally that one feels it
to be on the verge of announcing the
end of the world, or some other event
of at least as much importance; but
its main message is that Fellini had
trouble finding a subject matter for
his eight-and-a-half-th movie, a fact
which becomes increasingly apparent
as the movie limps forward.

The no more than good subject mat-
ter is buffeted to pieces by a mise-en-
scene that compares favorably with
some of the greatest ever ac-
complished on film. Fellini is careful
to conceive of his form and his content
in one instant, but they fall apart
despite his pains,.for the content half
of the conception is almost invariably -
weaker than the formal half.

Only occasionally does the mise-en-
scene manage to brazen things
through on-its own or the content to
measure up to the demands of the
mise-en-scene. Fellini’s surrealism
more often settles below than above
realism-as in “Fellini Satyricon.”

Among those movies by Fellini that
I have seen, “Fellini Satyricon’ is ex-
ceeded in general lack of excellence
only by ‘Toby Dammit,” his
contribution to “‘Spirits of the Dead.”

As Stanley Kauffmann has pointed
out, “Fellini Satyricon” is the movie

Fellini might have made if he had not

done “81%.” A mindless spectacle by a

tired, fading artist, ‘‘Fellini

Satyricon” at least has the virtue of

not pretending’ to allegorical

Fellini Satyricon’

But in its attempt to make form pass
for content and in its rejection of
narrative structure, ‘‘Fellini
Satyricon” has large enough preten-
sions. Fellini seems to be one of those
directors who feel he has better
things to do with his time than to
make successful movies.

“The Clowns” is successful and
relaxed because Fellini made it for
television, yet on the large screen it
works better than any of his other
movies that I have seen.

“Fellini Satyricon” is an attempt to
luxuriate in images of a declining
society--Rome before Christ and after
Fellini, as the advertisements say—

' while making a few mock pretenses

toward condemning that society.

The movie fails because it is unable
to make ancient Rome look par-
ticularly seductive, or even in-
teresting. The film struts and fumes
and pretends to be a ferocious fan-
tasy, all the while revealing itself to
be the work of a courtly Falstaff in
naughty humor. Fellini is much too
bourgeois and “healthy” to throw
himself passionately into his films,
and where can a decadent film go
without passion?

It loses all sense of purpose,
becoming as limp as Encolpius’ un-
cooperative penis in the arena scene.
Sure, antuan love goddesses lum-
breasts, but can we believe that even
Fellini finds these creatures erotic?

The movie starts out in a singularly
unconvincing attempt to. simulate.
homo-eroticism and then rapidly
strays into hetero-eroticism, where
the director’s true interests lie, but
even here it fails.

-Fellini is in many ways a child who
has aged without growing older, and
wonderful effects are created in many

fau

of his movies becapse of this; in.
“Fellini Satyricon,’ however, his.
childlikeness comes close to turning
the film into a tittering obscenity.
Despite all its anal humor, four-
letter words, coy nudity, bordellos,
transvestites and so forth, ‘Fellini

- Satyricon” is as innocent as a new-

born aardvark. The characters in the

film do not take off their clothes when .

they make love. They don’t even fum-
ble at their clothes. They just sort of
wallow on top of each other and
assume that must be sex. In no way
does the acting suggest passion.
Fellini miscalculates in his direc-
tion of his actors; by having them
execute stylized movements that are
meaningless emotionally, he
alienates the film from itself. Fellini
can be a fine director of realistic ac-
ting but is usually a deplorable direc-

tor of frankly stylized acting.

Only a few actors are allowed to
give reasonable performances;
among them, Lucia Bose, a highly
respected Spanish actress whose
work other than in this film I have not
seen, is a standout. As the Suicide
Wife, she uses a few simple, well-
thought-out movements and her eyes

-and-if I may use such a term—her.
that she fully realizes ©

the. magnitude of her situation,.
creating the illusion that she believes

They are outrageously fan-

that are usually and unusually
mechanized, industrialized,
and .deviously designed for
dastardly destructive doings.
Nelson’s style is reasonably
consistent and well developed.
His imagination seems to be
held in check only by his

slavish devotion to clear

draughtsmanship and linear
sharpness.

While Nelson’s work is not
profound, it is certainly en-
joyable, strange and very en-
