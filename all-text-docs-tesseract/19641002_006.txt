Young GOP's Have

Rebirth, Pick New!

Student Leaders

The Young Republicans Club
was reborn Wednesday night
under the temporary leadership
of Roland Ejidson, J. Pinckney
Whitson, and Larry Noah.

With attendance at 35, the
neophyte Republicans first con-
cerned themselves with organ-
izational business. Committees
were chosen for nominations of
officers and formation of a per-
manent constitution. An ‘‘imme-
diate actions’ committee was
selected in order to facilitate
rapid retaliation to any asser-
tions issued by the liberal
camp.

Official business shall be ini-
tiated within the next week be-
ginning with a Conservative re-
ply to “this Patterson fellow’
by a local Republican candi-
date.

The club believes ‘‘that the
best government is that which
governs least.” The group sup-
ports a campaign “appealing to
no particular ethnic group,”
and they reiterate the “party’s
basic tenet this year — the
worthwhileness of each individ-
ual.’ After asserting that the
“American economy is now the
most progressive among world
powers,” the club reaffirmed
its belief in the necessity of
changing the present admin-
istration,

Davidson's Young Republicans
postulate that they do not com-
pose a purely Goldwater or-
ganization. However. they in-
tend to destroy the radical im-
age which the Republican nom-
inee projects. The club boasts
a few Eastern-style Republi-
cans, but “Barry's Boys’’ will
dominate the outfit's proceed-
ings.

Membership is open to all Re-
publicans for a mere S2 annual
fee, Besides next week's meet.
ing. Wednesday at 7 p.m. in
the Union, the club’s members
are participating in a Young
Republican Convention in Dur-
ham today and tomorrow.

Charles Mitchell
Will Speak Monday

Charles J. Mitchell, Repub-
lican candidate for State
Treasurer, will be Mondays
chapel speaker.

Appearing under the ausple-
es of the Great Issues Pro-
gram and the recently organ-
ized Young Republican Club,
Mitchell was a 1950 Davidson
graduate end a member of
Kappe Alpha Order.

Following graduation from
Davidson, Mitchell became
associated with a financial
institution in eastern North

supporting, according to Robert
A. Currie, College business
manager.

Currie reports that the laun-
dry opérated at a loss last year
and predicted a slight increase
in the laundry fees for students
next year. “We thought it best
to increase prices step by step
until the laundry operation
reaches the break-even point,”
said Currie.

some dismay that basic laundry |

charges to members of the fac-
ulty and administration have
also risen this fall. Currie ex-
plained that the faculty is
charged two rates for shirts.
The charge for rough-dried
shirts and other apparel is by
weight. Finished shirts are
more expensive. The price for
rough-dried laundry has been
increased this year with the re-
sult that finished shirts now are
not substantially more expen-
sive than unfinished ones.

Several factors have increased
the laundry’s cost of operation.
A three-per-cent sales tax on
services was levied a year and
a half ago by the state. In ad-
dition practically all employ-
ees of the college, including
laundry workers, have received
a pay raise of about five per
cent each year since 1957.

Cost of supplies has increas-
ed, For example, the cost of
dry cleaning detergent has al-
most doubled in the past three
years. Shipping costs for all
supplies have increased each
year.

Results of an independent
survey of dry cleaning estab-
Hishments in the Southeast show-
ed average price per suit to be
$1, so the college ‘price of 90
cents cash or 80 cents with
coupon is still less than com-
mercial rates.

Freshman Court Sentences

27 Violators To Hard Labor

By BRITT SNIDER
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Freshman Court, dispensing
justice with maximum dispatch
and efficiency. met Wednesday
night and sentenced 27 fresh:
man violators to various per-
iods of “hard labor’ in an ef-
fort to reconcile these ‘“‘rabble-
rousers’’ with the college com-
munity in which they find them-
selves.

Over forty violations have
been turned in thus far, accord-
ing to Freshmen Adviser John
Barrow, and those convicted
have deen sentenced to var-
ious menial tasks, such as work
on the cross country course, to-
taling student council question-
naires, or attending to needs of

Hindsley. Joe Peel, and ‘Vernon
Anderson. each with four
“squeals” to his credit.
Although Barrow has no fig-
ures on last year’s court oper-
ations, he feels that this year's
enforcement of these regula-
tions has been much better than
in years past. He is hesitant
to attribute this increased en-
forcement to the ‘Joe Jones
Award recognition, but this
seems to be the only explana-
tion. ‘Regulations this year are

actually more lax than in years
past (walking on the grass is
allowed), and it appears unlike-
ly.that upperclassmen have be-
come any more conscientious,

Indications are, however, that
it will not be all glory for the
Joe Jones winner. Rumbles
among freshmen have. it that a
tremendous shower-party is in
store for the upperclassman
gaining the dubious distinction.
Ah, well, the road to glory is
often a hard one.

BY HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Weiter

In a highly interesting
and occasionally amusing
chapel address Thursday
morning Dr. Roland M. Fry
expounded his theories on
“the problems of self-know-
ledge, self - understanding
self - acceptance” to the
Davidson student body.

Dr. Fry, a research professor
in the Fogler Shakespeare Lib-
rary in Washington, D. C., has
done considerable work on this
subject as is evinced by his
books relating the Christian doc-
trine to this problem of man.

‘In our early years,” stated
Dr. Fry, “We are told just to
be ourselves, Good advice, but
how are we to be ourselves if
we do not know ourselves? This
brings us to the most important
question of all; how can we get
to know ourselves?”

According to Dr. Fry, ‘‘Ed-
ucation is one way to get to
know ourselves. With a liberal
education one can gain insights
into bis problems through the
personal insights of those be.
fore him. But a man must be
careful in this process of self-
evaluation and realization, for
even if he is successful much
pain and toil is involved: if he
fails it could mean the destruc-
tion of his character and’ per-

”

son.

All of this brings up the ques-
tion of why man struggles to
realize himself when lower ani-
mals merely accept themselves
as being and nothing more. The
answer, in Dr. Fry's words, is
that man ‘‘wants to be more
than a merely human animal.
Man, from the time of the an-
cient Greeks, has generally
striven for the highest ideals.
But these ideals are persistent-
ly unobtainable.’ What then is
man to do when he can not
reach his goal?

Dr. Fry has given the two
major ways in which man has
always attempted to deal with
his failure and resulting guilt
by alluding to various literary
works. In one, Shaw's play en-
titled Major Barbara, man is
shown to react to this situation
of shame and failure by bear-
ing the pain of self or ‘‘other™
inflicted punishment, or by
somehow paying for it monetari-
ly.

Thus does Oedipus in Odeipus
Rex punish himself when he
finds out his guilt. In Milton's
Parade Lost Adam (Man) and
Eve (Woman) are shown to be
punished by God when they try
to change from their human
Status into gods, and they fail.
The pain they bear is not phy-
sical, but it fs nevertheless a

Zon Announces Two
Projects For DERE

The Davidson Civil Rights
Committee will begin its fall
program at the first meeting
at 7:00 Monday night at the
Davidson United Presbyterian
Church.

According to Chairman Calvin
Zon, the committee will soon
launch a_ two-point program
among. the town's Negroes to
get out the vote Nov. 3 and to
better “the deplorable living
conditions’ in low-income areas.

Other committee officers in-
clude Harold: Houston, first
vice chairman: Rev, William
Morris, second vice chairman;
Van Quinn, secretary-treasur- [
er: Steve Goode. corresponding
secretary; and Professors Phil-
ip B. Secor, Samuel D. Malon-
ey, and E. F, Patterson, mem-
bers-at-large of the executive
comunittee.

The 50 members of the DCRC
pay no dues eycept for a st
initiation fee which is used to
support their programs.

The get-out-the-vote project
will be a door-to-door affair.
Zon said, ‘‘We will visit every
Negro home in Davidson to urge
registered voters to go to the
polls on election day. We are
concerned with the Negro get-
ting the vote.’ When asked
about apathetic white citizens,

Zon remarked, ‘That's another
matter. We can't handle every-
thing.”

The housing project follows a
survey on housing conditions
made last year by the David-
son Mayor's Committee on
Rights. Zon’s committee will
make a more specific inquiry
into the problem and try to pro-
duce some solutions.

‘“‘Maybe we can get some
FHA aid," said Zon, “but we
will cross that bridge when we
get there,”

Charlotte Minister
To Speak Sunday

Rev, Thom W. Blair, rector of
Christ Episcopal Ctrch in
Charlotte, will conduct the
third of 14 vesper services this
semester on Sunday at 7:30
p. m.

Blair, who was educated at
the University of Virginia and

at Virginia Theological Semi- ~

nary in Alexandria, served in
several parishes before he came
to Charlotte in 1957.

After serving as chaplain in
the anti-submarine warfare
branch of the Navy during
World War II, he was rector at
Hanover Courthouse, Va., and
at St. Luke's Church in Salis-

very real pain of alienation from
themselves, each other, and
from. God.

Therefore, says Dr, Fry, man
always tries to solve this prob-
lem of dealing with failure and
guilt by either payment or the
bearing of pain, but neither of
these can absolve, as both are
‘bound up" with man’s self in-
terest.

In summary, the campus visit-
or stated that although an es-
cape from this problem of shame
and failure is not possible, a
“rescue’’ is possible. This rescue

man has no control over. Rather,
it is the spontaneous gift of an-
other to man. This rescue is
through the incarnation and
atonement given man by God.
This is precisely what man
needs to come to terms with
his guilt and failure, and this
is what Christianity offers him
as a way of dealing with his
problem and finding himself.

In short, concluded Dr. Fry,
we can recognize and accept
ourselves simply on the basis
that God himself has loved and
established us as individuals.
