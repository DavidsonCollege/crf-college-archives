Jackson & Warren
Exhibit In Charlotte
Gallery Crawl

By David Smyth

The Davidson College Art De-
partment had a banner day last
Friday night as two of its profes-
sors, Herb Jackson and Russ War-
ren, exhioited their paintingsin the
Gallery Crawl in downtown Char-
lotte.

Showing their works in the
Jerald Melberg and Hodges Taylor
galleries respectively, Jackson and
Warren represented Davidson with
two .artists for the first time in
Crawl history.

Jackson works entirely with
acrylics on canvas and creates
textural abstract pieces with the
help ofmixed-in pumice stone dust
and micacrystals. He has the dust,
an industrial abrasive, sent in from
Boston in five hundred pound ship-
ments to use with the acrylic paint.
The mica is mined in Burnsville,
North Carolina.

Both the dust and the mica help
tocreatea more three-dimensional
veneer and allow Jackson to scrape

away Dainlto reveal layers that
have been previously added. At
the same time the surface does not
become overly brittle because the
mixtureis still mostly acrylic paint.-
Each of Jackson's paintings have
between fifty and one hundred
layers.

He typically works with three
to four paintings at once which are
begun and finished at about the
same time. In the process of com-
pleting a series, one will usually
assert itself and cry for work be-
fore the others. Eventually all of
the paintings will come to finish-
ing pointsandanew groupisbegun.

When asked if he would likely
sell any of his works on Friday
night, Jackson replied: “Gallery
crawls aren’t really about selling,

they*reaboutcelebrating. But who
knows? Somebody might walk in
and decide they have to have one.”
Included among the paintings that
someone might have to have were
Sisyphusand Gathering, which had
already been shown in New York
and Moscow respectively. The
rest were being presented to the
public for the first time.

Warren reveals an Hispanic
and Latin American influence in
his paintings which are acrylics
done on canvas and paper. He
hails originally from Houston,
Texas and also raises Pasofino
horses whose «whole training
method is Spanish and Latin
American. Latin American folk
art, he says, has also helped direct
the general tone of his work.

His acrylics on paper closely
resemble watercolors, and they
nearly approximate that medium
in consistency. Fluid acrylics
mixed with water, though, gives
him a richness that he cannot al-

-ways find in watercolors ‘and is

more durable.

Female horses dominate War-
ren’s paintings, as in Fino, Fino,
Por Favor and Bellaza Hoy Dea,
Fino Manana. These works on
canvas present Pasofino silhouettes
as centerpieces in front of oddly
intriguing backgrounds.

Warren noted that he also works
on several paintings at a time,
usually three to five begun on the
same day and finished on the same
day. “It would be crazy to work on
one painting at a time,” he said.
“You need time to incubate ideas
in your mind before going back to
work on one painting.” It gener-
ally takes six to eight weeks of
constant work to finish a series of
five.

Steamrollin’ |
With Art Professor Andy Owens

By Will Montgomery and Jim
Carswell
On Saturday, October 19 a

crowd of students, faculty and
curious bystanders turned out to
Owens cre-
ate prints in
his unique
manner.

After pouring paint and water

over the pile, he covered it all with
paper and a blanket. Then it was
onto the steamroller to flatten it.
Reactions were mixed (“whatis he
doing?” to “that print really came
out good!™), but the whole crowd
did seem to enjoy witnessing the
making of art.

Owens’ method is not the fait

of sudden inspiration, but the re-

sult of years of artistic endeavor.

He began working with lithogra-
phy and etching at an early age,
learning much about printing from
aneighbor. After undergraduate
work at the University of Florida
he was asked to be a resident print-
maker in Wolfsburg, Germany,

where he lived in a castle and
During graduate work at the Uni-
versity of Arizona he travelled to
Mexico to study murals and large
drawings.

He credits a near death experi-
ence in adisgusting Mexican hos-
pital as impetus for his affinity for
the steamroller printing process.
Victim ofa bacillism from infected
shellfish, Owens recalls inserting
his own IV and humbly pondering

~ the Mexican slogan “mi vida no

vale nada.” This frightful experi-
ence impressed Owens with asense
of absurdity and meaninglessness
in life. This feeling and a back-
ground in printing and lithography
attracted him to art that seeks to
uncover order amid chaos. Owens
describes his
process with a
saying of Picasso
who expigined
that he “doesn’t
try tocopy nature,
but tes to work
. Owens doesn’t
know of anyone
in the world, ex-
cept for David

The steamroller
serves as a large and mobile print-

Actor Brad Griffin On The Kiss Me, Kate Experience

Being an actor at Davidson is
much like being a football player
ora member of the Honor Council
at Davidson: it takes time -- large
amounts of time -- which is why so
many would-be actors refuse even
to audition fora Davidson produc-
tion.

als for Kiss Me Kate did someone
ask me, “are you getting credit for
this?” The look of astonishmenton
their faces when I told them that
self-satisfaction was my only credit

ered questionable for having taken
on such an arduous task.

At times during rehearsal, I,
too, doubted my sanity. We prac-
ticed eighteen hours a week for
seven weeks and then moved up to
twenty-five hours during the two
weeks before the show.

And yet, I would not have

changed the system. The members

of the cast formed a truly tight-knit:

group (as the high number of cast/
crewromances which arose during
production will attest!), a group
three-hour rehearsals and made

one.

The road to the finished prod-
uct, however, was difficultat times.
If I were to estimate the number of
times Timisha Barnes slapped me
during the rehearsal of the fight
scene between Kateand Petruchio,
my guess would number in excess
ofone hundred. Timeafter time we
worked on théStap until she finally
hit me so hard that I fell to the
ground witha bloody lip. Hey -- no
pain, no gain! Right?

By the time opening night
rolied around, we had worked
through the slap so that we could

concentrate on creating the level

the stage and congratulate each
other on being so angry. Acting...
go figure.

As the opening night ap-
proached, tension and excitement
crept into the rehearsals. The first
dress rehearsal in our costumes
threatened to dip into the ridicu-
lous as we saw each other in those
ever-so-sexy tights for the first
time. The task at hand resurfaced,
though, and we all buckled down
to some serious “acting.”

At this point, no amount of

words and explanation could ade-
quately express the satisfaction
derived from working on a show
like this one, From the standpoint
of vanity, itis exciting to take that
bow during the curtain call as your
hard work isrewarded, —

From amore modest view, the
