THE DAVIDSONIAN, March 25, 1920.

E. E. HOUGHTON WINS
DECLAMATION CONTEST

EUMENEAN SOCIETY

Sixteen Aspiring Orators Deliver
Varied and Excellent Speeches.
Bailey, Ogden and Bitzer Win
Honorable Mention.

As regards both quantity and
quality of work, the Eumenean
Fresh-Soph’ Declamation
was one of the most hotly contested
events held in a long time. Sixteen
frenzied speakers, alternately fur-
ious and pathetic, came and went ere
the long program ended. There
were four grave-yard addresses, two
court-room speeches, three patriotic
orations, two “classical” pieces, a
war poem, and a number of others
that defy classification. The de-
cision was awarded E. E. Houghton
who gave a very thrilling court-
room address by Webster in which
he described a singularly cold blood-
ed murder scene and demanded of
the jury that they uphold the law.
Honorable mention was made of
Bailey, Ogden and Bitzer.

W. W. Moore began the program
with a humorous defense of a moon-
shiner. Richards then discussed the
home and Ogden eufogized woman.

H. H. Smith next delivered the “Flag
i Day Address.” This was followed
! by two funeral orations by McGukin
and HH. Morris on “Lafayette” and
“My Brother” respectfully. Two
| patriotic addresses were next, de-
' livered by P. D. Miller and Z. Morris
on the “New South” and “America’s
Entrance into the War.” Houghten
then gave his winning courtroom
address, followed by Dunn with a
war poem, “Flourette.” Sloan then
gave an interesting dicussion of
“Americanization,” McLaughlin fol-
lowed with a second rendering of the
“Death of Lafayette.” Two ver-
sions of “Regulus to the Cartha-
genians” were next given by Bitzer
and Price, separated only by Dick’s
excellent address on the “Death of
Jackson.” The program, was then
concluded by Bailey with one of the
strongest speeches of the evening on
“Shall the Statue of Lee stand in the
Hall of Fame.” On the whole, the
program was.a very fine one indeed,
and there is little wonder that the
judges had great difficulty in award-
ing the decision.

EUMENEAN SOCIETY.

Lyceum and Mary Pickford Triumph
Over Societies.

Again the Redpath Chautauqua and
Mary Pickford have arrived at
Davidson on the same Saturday

night, and prevented the Literary ’

societies from carrying out their ar-
ranged programs. For this reason,
neither society was able to hold a
meeting on last’ Saturday night
(much to the deep regret of all the
members).

The Eumenean Society will have
a joint meeting of its two sections
on the 27th, next Saturday night,
andthe same program will be given
as vas planned for last time. It is
urgent that all members be present,
and especially those who have not
been coming. They are given a cor-
dial invitation! The debaters are ex-
pected to have good debates, since
‘having two weeks of preparation,
| and the honored judges for the night

thropic Society. The meeting will
be held this time regardless_—.

, Polity Clubs throughout the South |

on International questions. Davidson
was fortunate in having him and his
address was both interesting and in-
‘ structive.

Speaking on the subject, “Consti-
tutional Obstacles to International
‘Comity,” Professor Kimball showed
the relation between the various
governments of the present day
‘democracies and the people who con-
stitute these states. He also showed
‘the relations between the govern-
ments of the sovereign independent
states and the obstacles in the way
‘of keeping this relation harmonious.

The lack of popular control in dur:
‘own and other democratic states was

also discussed. This discussion was
lin line with the regular work of the
Polity Club and it should be in-
, Strumental in securing a deeper and
‘more sincere Interest in internation-
al affairs.
