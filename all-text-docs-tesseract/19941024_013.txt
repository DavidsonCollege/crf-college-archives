‘Theater Review

Learned Ladies succeeds despite dated script

By Robert Ramsay

’ In Moliére’s culture, his play
The Learned Ladies was a biting
social parody. Today, at Davidson,
itis alittle dated. However, Rupert
T. Barber, Jr., pulled together a
group of actors and directed them
with such eptitude that the Hodson
Hall production made a fine trib-
ute to the wacky Frenchman. De-
spite slightly chauvanistic themes
and incredibly difficult ryhming
couplets, the performance was
well-received. Part of the reason
for this was Richard Wilbur’s ex-
traordinary translation, Ronnie
Higdon’s attractive, easy-access
set, and the actors, who all gave
solid performances.

The play focuses on a bour-
geois French family: father
Chrysale (Josh Gaffga), mother
Philaminte (Catherine Sauls), older
daughter Armande (Laura Seib),
and younger daughter Henriette
(Sarah Hankins). Armande and
Philaminte are similar in that they
both enjoy the study of philosophy
and science; Henriette takes after
her father, who would rather be in
the garden than ina library or labo-

ratory. Armande and her mother,
along with Bélise (Catherine
Rivenbark), an aunt, are so caught
up in their intellectual emancipa-
tion that they don’t realize they are
speaking foolishness. Most of the
men in the play spend their time
trying to find a way to stand up to

ous that Armande, after Clitandre’s
speech on love, does not agree
with what she is saying but is too
proud to concede. She is so frus-
tratingly in love with her own in-
telligence that, at the end, you want
to see her jump on someone.

The epitome of what Moliére

nicely and predictably with a final
quip by Chrysale to his now-sub-
dued wife. ;

Barber chose the cast excep-
tionally well. Josh Gaffga was
great as the flacid father and deliv-
ered his couplets with delectable
normality. Catherine Sauls as

The only serious topic of intellec--

tual debate in the play that does not
boil down to rhetoric concerns the
nature of love. Armande claims
that love which shows itself in
physical acts is shallow and mate-
rial; only love founded in philoso-
phy and spirituality can bond two
people together. Clitandre (Ben-
jamin Summers), suitor .to
Henriette, vehemently argues that
love is material, but it is this mate-
rialism and physicality that makes
it so special and so appealing.
Seib’s performance makes it obvi-

intended to mock is personified by
the wit, Trissotin (Andrew
Smitherman). He is a shoddy poet,
a inept romanticizer, and an arro-
gant prick. His speech is empty
and stale, most of his colorful epi-
grams stolen from classic writers
and rhetoriticians. By the final
scene, contempt and pity for him
have piled up so thick that his
departure is almost anticlimactic.
He is proven to be a greedy oppor-
tunist by Uncle Artiste’ s (Matthew
Smith) clever letter trick. Once
Trissotin is gone, the plot wraps up

scowl that will haunt your night-
mares. Laura Seib, once you got
used to the rythmic two octave
swells in her voice, did a decent
job, and positively shone in the
recitation scene. When she screams
in orgasmic ecstacy, “I’mravished,
quite!” you believe her. Sarah
Hankins gave Henriette a simple,
down-to-earth attractiveness that
was refreshing. The were many
other notable performances, in-
cluding Benjamin Summer’s lu-
minescent Clitandre and Sarah
Zogby’s tasty Martine, but the Ursa

"Marc LaFrance was elated

all bearded men, I’ve wondered
often what the non-bearded life

On other hair fronts, I cannot

campus earlier last month. Slowly,
one by one, the actual hair of many
men and women began to disap-

nants remaining.

covers it, unless you have any ques-
tions you want to analyze it.” I
thought about it, and then remem-
bered the absolute non-meaning
requirement in the fashion article
rulebook of writing and reluctantly,
et happily, declined.

Majors in the show were Catherine
Rivenbark and Andrew
Smitherman. Rivenbark, as Bélise,
had a face that you wanted to slap
senseless and then, a second later,
record to show at birthday parties.
And Smitherman’s Trissotin was
such a bundle of high-browed so-
cial contempt and condescension
that all you could do was laugh
until you lost bladder control. The
poetry recitation he gives was,
hands down, the highlight of the
show, and the rhetorical exchange |

between Trissotin and Vadius

(Patrick Brown) was good, too.
Ultimately, the biggest kudos
must go to Barber, who set sail on
a stormy sea by picking up
Moliére's script, but, in the end,

did not sink.
