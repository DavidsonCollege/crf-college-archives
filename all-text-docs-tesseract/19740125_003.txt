SGA Examines

The SGA Senate has recom-
mended a revision of David-
son’s Page as course
registration policy. If adopted
by the faculty, this change will

registration, The committee is
chaired by Registrar Richard
C. Burts Jr.; Canterbury is the
lone student representative.

The Senate recom-
mendation will be sent back to
Burts’ committee, where ap-
proval is expected. For final
approval, it needs to go to the
Educational Policy Com-
mittee, and then on to the
general faculty.

For the last two years, all
students have followed the
same registration procedure:
each student ranks six courses
in the order of his preference,
and he is given the first three
in which there are openings.
The Senate recommendation is
that this procedure be
retained as one _ option
available to students.

A second option would per-
mit a student to list one course
as his “‘primary’”’ first choice
and two as his ‘‘alternative’’
first choices; the first course
on his schedule would then
come from one of these three
preferences.

Following each of these first
choices would be listed a
primary and an alternative
second choice; the student’s
second course would become
either the primary or alter-
native second choice given for
the particular first choice that
was selected.

Finally, the third course is
chosen from primary and
alternative third choices in the

characterized the whole
process as an “inverted tennis
tournament’’.

This procedure was
developed by Professor of
Physics Locke White, one of
the faculty members of the ad
hoc committee, and it was
designed mainly in response
to complaints that the stan-
dard system in which a
student needs at least one of
two courses but does not want
to take both of them.

Canterbury pointed to the
example of a freshman pre-
med student who needs either
Bio 31 or Chem 31, but
preferably not at the same
time.

According to the current
procedure, if such a student
puts them both on his list of
preferences he will hopefully
get at least one of them, but he
may get the other as well; on
the other hand, if he only puts
one on his list he could end up
with neither.

Canterbury argued that
White’s procedure would bet-
ter accomodate such a
student.

However, there are dif-
ficulties with it. According to
Canterbury, with as much as
three times as many computer
cards required by this plan (as
opposed to the procedure
now), the school might need to
support a full-time computer
assistant for registration
alone.

Nevertheless, the Senate
recommended this method
over the status quo and one
other suggested alternative
without a dissenting vote.

SGA President Blain Butner
was pleased with the
decision. ‘‘It sounds more

complicated, but the new
procedure is feasible, and it’s
definitely an improvement
over what we have now.”’

Meager Enrollment Causes
Madrid Term Cancellation

By MARK DEATON
. Managing Editor

The Spring Term in Madrid
program planned by the
Spanish department has been
cancelled due to insufficient
enrollment.

The program as approved
by the Educational Policy
Committee (EPC) called for a
12 student minimum.
Although 11 people showed
various degrees of interest,
only six made the definite
commitment to participate.

“I’m very distressed by
this,’’ said Professor of
Spanish Lois A. Kemp. ‘‘We’ll
try to go through the steps
again to carry out the
program next year.”

Kemp indicated that earlier
recruiting for next year’s
program might help ensure
success in getting the
program under way. “I’m
hoping to start recruitment
this spring.’’

The Spring Term in Madrid
program was planned during
the past summer and presen-

ted to the EPC for approval in
November. Faculty approval
was not expressed until De-
cember.

Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan expressed hope that the
program could be_ im-
plemented next year.

“I’m very disappointed,”’
said Bevan. ‘‘We’ll just have
to do a better job in recruiting
in the future.”’

Approximately 100 different
students take one or more
Spanish courses during a
school year. Successfully
filling the Madrid program
would require one out of every
10 Spanish students to par-
ticipate. ‘‘This is rather am-
bitious,”’ admitted Kemp.

Students entering the
program would be required to
have the equivalent of Spanish
20. ‘‘Students have to be able
to survive in Madrid
language-wise,’’ Kemp ex-

The program which would
grant the student three course

credits was not intended to be
exclusively for Spanish
maiors.

In fact, only two of the 11 in-
tersted in the program were
department majors,” Kemp
said.

‘“‘When the EPC and faculty
approved this program, it was
only for a one year trial basis.
Then the program would be
evaluated to see if it were
worth making a regular fea-
ture of our foreign study pro-
gram,” said Kemp.

She hopes that
the Spring Term in Madrid
program would be offered
every other year with a Spring
Term in Latin America being
offered in alternative years.

“At this point my feeling is
that we’re not doing justice to
the area of Latin America,”
Kemp said. Mexico, Costa
Rica, or Guatemala might be
possible areas to hold a Latin
America spring term pro-
gram, she indicated.
