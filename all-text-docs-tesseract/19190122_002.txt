PRP,

Pep is the god of Gio0d Fortune, .the
Herald of Success, the Antidote for De-
feat, the Main Spring for Conquerors.
Caesar had it when he crossed the Rubi
con; Napoleon lost it on the field of
Waterloo; Bill Hohenzollern lost it
last November ot; some students iaag
ine they have it when they break out
window lights. [t's that which is. be-
hind the use of lasty lumps, whether the
team is winning or losing; it’s — that
which makes a fellow give ap his Sunday
morning sleep for a Bible class, it’s that
which makes a fellow gladly “lend a
hand” where it is needed for the, good
of the college: it's that which makes a
‘fellow keep driving in the game, altho
he is. completely: exhausted; it's that
which brings the grin, and has ‘nothing
in common with the grouch.

PEP is FREE: use it on all occasions;
betore big games: during big’ games;
atter big games; in your room: on the
campus; at home. Make vou life full

FOOD FOR THOUGHT,

The number of guld stars on the Da-
vidson College service tla is) sixteen.
Now that the war is aver, and we ture
to more peaceful parsuits, there natur-
ally occurs to many that there should be
some fitting memorial set up on the
campus to these sixteen, . Et is something
which should not be done hastily, as it
should carry with it the deepest consid-
eration and esteem of all concerned. But
it should be brought before students and
alumni alike and made subject to their
thoughts. and ideas. We hope some
action can be taken on this before the
end of the year.

PUBLIC OPINION,

There are some things which public
opinion alone can regulate, and one of
these is the- habit of “swiping” light
globes from public places, and of “bor-
rowing” articles belonging to some one
else and never returning them. It can-
not be denied that public opinion makes
no organized protest against this. Some-
how things have become so twisted that
such acts are not looked upon by many
as thefts. It would be interesting to see
how they argue their point. When a
remover of light globes begins to lose
something of his own, possibly he will
start going to Mr. Hill and start paying

The DAVIDSONIAN, January 22, 1919

a hard forty-five cents for his lights.
Another thing which will require pub-
lic opinion tu eliminate is the habit of
cutting pieces here and there out of
publications in the reading room. Look-

something which does not belong to the
clipper; and, too, it is not very courteous
after requests have been made frequently
to the contrary. Again, it is unfair to
others, as everyone has an equal right to
enjoy all the reading room literature,

How long will it be before the stu-
dent body loses patience with these prac-
tices and stamps them out?

A FINE RECORD,
_ Phe present Freshman class has made
a record for itself that it may well be
proud of. . No class for years has fur-
nished such a large number, and prob-
ably no better quality, of men for the
two Literary Societies than the class of
‘22 has done. Who knows but what it
is the work of this class to give the so-
cicties their long looked -for regenera-
tion? In any case a heavy responsibility
rests upon the new society men, and it
remains ta be seen whether they will
respond. “The war has diminished the
number of upperclassmen in. the societies
hy at least fifty per cent. Tt wont be
long before most of the sectety duties
will rest upon the shoulders of the new
nen, and it is up to them to begin a
new era, building the evo organizations
up to their former place of influence and
service on the campus.

You will find upperclassmen in’ the
societies, who do no work: and who act-
ually do harm by their indifference or
talk; but do-not judge these organiza-
tions by such men, and above all things
don't think gou are supposed to copy
them. Many a man never pretends to
prepare iw speech, cuts up fooltshtiess
most of the time, and then says the
suctety iS no good, because he hasn't
learned how to speak. No one can get
more out of the society than he puts into
it, That's ‘an established fact.

This spring there will be a number
of contests. Go into every one of them.
Don't get the idea that the only reason
for entering a contest is to win a medal,
because it's not, Work up loyalty for
your Literary Society and actively sup-
port it, Don't sit by and merely watch
it dritt along. Freshmen, it rests with
you, What are you going to do about

‘it?

SPANN PILOTS JUNIORS.

At a class meeting on Monday morn-
ing the Juniors elected the following of-
ficers to serve the rest of the college
year: Henry Spann as president : James
Witherspoon, vice-president; A. Foscue.
secretary and treasurer, and Chalmers,
Calhoun and as student coun-
selmen.

With this band of men in control, the
class of ‘20 will no doubt continue to
hold the place it should on the campus
of Davidson.

The Date of Junior Speaking was
also decided upon, being March 7-8-9.

The war's over now, so what about
those old good times on the campus.
Get your “bids” ready!
