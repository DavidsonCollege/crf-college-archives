Square Dance

Is Sponsored

By Civic Club

Attracts Many Students and
Townspeople; Club Has
Twofold Purpose

Davidson's Civic Club spon-
sored a real old fashioned
square dance last Saturday
night, Jan. 14th, in the high
school gymnasium.

Many high school and college
students attended the dance along
with many townspeople. Real coun-
try fiddlers were imported to give
the regular old fashioned tunes
that were popular when our grand-
mothers and grandfathers were
young: “Skit” McConnell called the
figures and had them demonstrat-
ed when anyone seemed to be in
dotibt.

The Davidson Civic Club has a
twofold purpose in sponsoring this
entertainment in the high. school].
gym. The first reason, is to pro-
vide entertainment for the high
school students and for those boys
from the college who like to attend.
The second reason is to carn money
to carry through the Civic Club's
building program in the Negro sec-
tion of Davidson.

Investigations were made con-
cerning the Negro’s housing condi-
tions and things were found to be
an appalling array. The Civic Club
started its campaign by buying four
lots and building a house on one
of them for Negro occupation.

Carolina Fiends

Fred Smith tells how he has
already gotten a permanent

several new plays, and also a
regular northern snowstorm.
“A snowstorm would catch me
about the third day in New
York,” he says, “It is now a-
bout 8 inches deep, but doesn't
look as pretty as it does around
Davidson.”
Sees “Hellzapoppin'’”

‘Fred tells about the play “Hellza-
poppin’ ” which he saw on the stage
the other night, and deseribes it as
“a rip-roaring story which has a
little bit. of any and everything in
it.”

“Peter Sees Christ’s Glory” Is
The Subject Of Address
Given in Phi Hall

Dr. C. K. Brown spoke for
the second time in Sunday
School last Sunday in Phi Hall.
His subject was the standard

j Sunday School lesson for this

week: Peter Sees Christ's
Glory _and_he took his text
from Matthew 17:1-5.

As Dr. Brown stated, Christ had
previously been révealed to his dis-
ciples op the: occasion of Peter's
great confession, However, he was
still, misunderstood by everyone.
Thus the transfiguration was for
the purpese of letting the inner
group of disciples gain a fuller re-
velation of Christ's purpose.

“Mountain Apart”

As Dr. Brown has imagined it,
Christ took Peter. James, and John
up into a “mountain apart” for the
purpose of spending the night in
prayer as was Christ's custom. Pos-
sibly the three disciples were dos-
ing off and on during the night
while Christ prayed that they might
gain a fuller knowledge of the pur-
pose of his mission on earth. And
then in the wee hours of the morn-
ing came the actual transfiguration.
Christ appeared to his three discip-
les in his spiritual form—“and his
face did shine as the sun, and his
_raiment—was—white as-the -light.”
Moses and Elias also appeared to
them. And again Peter’s habit of
saying the wrong thing at the
wrong time ‘is shown as he asks
that tents be built for the three and
that they remain in the mountain
top always. Soon afterwards, how-
ever, they left the place and went
down into the village.

This ought to be a lesson to all
