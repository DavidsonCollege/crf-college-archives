vices, instruction, and academic
support, which includes libraries,
computers, andadministration. All
of the statistical data given by each
college is from 1991.

Davidson fell eleven spots in
the category of faculty resources
fromnumber forty in 1991 tonum-
ber fifty-one this year. Thecollege
improved its standing in financial
resources from a ranking of fifty-
first last year to this year’s ranking
of twenty-seventh.

According to Robert Morse of
U.S. News & World Report
Davidson improved in the finan-
cial resources category because the
magazine changed how this was
computed. This year the survey
emphasized education programs
and de-emphasized other elements
such as scholarships and opera-
tions. He said, “We emphasized
what was spent on only student
education.”

Morse also said that one rea-

son Davidson might have dropped .

in the faculty resources category
was a difference in proportion or
percentage of full-time faculty with
doctorates or other highest termi-
nal degrees.

Morse said that Davidson
moved up three spots because of a
change in how they weighted the
major categories. Basically,
Davidson improved its ranking
because the magazine’s survey

emphasized areas in which the col-
lege was strong, such as student
satisfaction, and de-emphasized
areas in which the college was
weak, such as faculty resources.

This year Davidson is ranked
fifteenth in the student satisfaction
and academic reputation catego-
ries. The college is ranked sixth in
the category of student selectivity.

U.S. News & World Report
calculates Davidson’s mean SAT
as 1220 and lists the acceptance
rate at 35%. The student/faculty
ratio is listed as 12-1 and the gradu-
ation rate is tabulated to be 84%.
The survey lists freshmen reten-
tion at.97%. The number one
school in the survey, Williams
College, is listed as having a 9-1
student/faculty ratio, a graduation
rate of 94%, and an average SAT
score of 1335.

Davidson’s overall score was
85.3, compared with an overall
score of 82.2 last year. As the top-
ranked school in the survey, Will-
iams received an overall score of
100.

John Kelton, director of Insti-
tutional Research, provided U.S.
News & World Report with the
Statistical data on Davidson Col-
lege. He said of the survey, “In
general, we do not want to take too
much pleasure or displeasure from
rankings of this sort. (But), it gives
us some recognition, we’d rather
be ranked than not.”

Davidson Grad Discusses
Central American Experiences

By Christopher Edwards

On Wednesday, September
16, about 50 people gathered in the
900 Room to hear Minor Sinclair,
a 1981 graduate of Davidson Col-
lege, discuss his experiences at
Davidson, his work with opressed
Central Americans, .and his
expousal of “liberation theology.”

Sinclair’s experiences at
Davidson helped him to see the
world through the eyes of the poor
and the oppressed. He saw
Davidson as a priveleged, homog-
enous Culture, in contrast to_the
heterogenous, oppressed cultures
which one can find in Charlotte
and Kentucky, where Sinclair

‘worked to help the poor.

According to Sinclair,
education’s goal should be “the
pursuit of justice.”

After graduating from
Davidson, Sinclair had a desire to
travel, and hitchhiked across the
United States.

He later began working tohelp
appressed Central Americans, such
as plantation workers, Guatamalian
villagers who were often bombed
by the government planés, and
Central American townspeople
who organize themselves to fight
oppression.

According to Sinclair, “an in-
dividual can resist injustices but
only communities can bring about
change.”

Sinclair believes that Central
American poor people have much
to teach Americans. In Central
America, being poor has positive
connotations: a poor person works
hard, and is honest and decent.
Also, poor Central Americans are
much more devout than Ameri-
cans, whose churches Sinclair finds
to be “meaningless” and “hypo-
critical.” ceetge

Sinclair espouses “liberation
theology” to help oppressed Cen-
tral Americans. He tries to“givea
voice tothose [Central Americans]
who don’t have a voice,” In Cen-
tral America, according to Sinclair,
the Gospel is being lived out every
day; it is not just a collection of
2,000 year old writings.

Currently, Sinclair lives in a
communal living group home in a
poor section of Washington, D.C.
He tries to livea “lifestyle of resis-
tance” to oppression and US-
backed militarism in Central
America by supporting the home-
less and by earning too low a salary
to be taxed, as some tax money
goes to military aid to Central
American gountries. ° Sinclair
thinks thatthe USS. should cut off
military aid to El Salvador.

Sinclair hopes that we will
consider all of the world’s poor as
brothers and sisters. He feels that
itis wrong to put America first in
the world, since everybody in the
world is equal:

MY DEGREE GOT ME
THE INTERVIEW.
ARMY ROTC GOT ME
THE JOB.

. Things got pretty competitive for this job. I’m
sure my college degree and good grades kept
me in the running. But in the end it was the
leadership and management experience I got
through Army ROTC that won them over. _

Army ROTC taught me responsibility, self-
discipline and leadership. Those are things
you just can’t learn from a textbook.

I don’t know where I'd be right now if I
hadn't enrolled in Army ROTC, but I do know
one thing for sure...I wouldn’t be here.
