fast rounding their charges into shape

seen a larger number of candi-

About fifty men have been going
through the daily routine ever
since “first call’’ was issued on
Labor Day. Not in the last de-
cade and a half, and perhaps
longer, has there been a complete
team of lettermen to return for a
second year’s service on a Wild-
cat eleven, as is the case this fall.
The 1934 season is also going to
bring to a close that long period
of justified complaint that David-
son always put one of the best
first string outfits on the field but
there were never any substitutes to
relieve the worn out starters.
Aside from the excellent looking
lettermen that will wear the red
and black during the next few
months there is a host. of scrappy,
determined reserves that will not
only make worthy substitutes, but
will probably get the call to be
on the field for the opening
kick-off, a good many times be-
fore Thanksgiving Day.

Special attention has been turned to
Carolina and State because of the new
coaching staff at both institutions.

Carolitia, under the able direction of
Carl Snavely, has an abundant supply
of good material with which to work.
The regular backfield, which will con+

Freshmen will toe the mark on Thurs-

who are not out for football enter the

of the Richardson Memorial Stadium.
From there it runs down the golf course
to the road, up a grueling hill to Con-

Fraternity Court, the total length being

17 miles. First honors were carried
off last fall by William Cox. The all-

YEARLING COACH

According to custom, one grad-
uate member of the Davidson Col-
lege football team is selected each
year to assist Red Laird as coach
for freshman athletics.

This year, Francis Parks Harri-
son of Mt. Ulla, has been secured
to fill this position. Harrison, who
graduated last year, played at
guard for four years during his col-
lege career here at Davidson. He
was especially active in athletics,
having been a member of the foot-
ball, baseball, and wrestling squads.
He was also a member of the ‘‘D”
club. Harrison will succeed Bruce
Peabody, Charlotte boy, who served
as assistant freshman coach last
year.

Most of coach Harrison’s time
will be devoted to developing lines-
men, particularly guards, among
candidates for the freshman team.
Various other things such as block-
ing, drills in fundamentals, and sig-
nals will also be a part of Harri-
son’s job as coach.

Hopes Are Bright

Thirty-five First Year Men Re-
port To Coaches Laird
And ‘Harrison
Prospects for the freshman football
team this year are about the same as last
year, according to Coach Flake Laird.
There are about thirty-five candidates
so far, fewer than last year, but enough
of the men show previous experience to
indicate that a team at least equal to
that of last year can be developed. A
week's practice, however, is too short
a time to definitely size up the material

at hand, said Laird.

This year’s squad, as a whole, seems
to be lighter than that df last year. The
line, as a result, will probably be weaker,
although it is composed of several ex-
perienced men. ‘The backfield, on the
other hand, shows signs of
good or better than last year’s.

sum total of the backfield candidates
includes quite an array of good passers,

Wildcat Grid Schedule

Features Home Games

The Davidson College Wildcat grid-
iron aggregation this fall enters upon
the most difficult schedules of
any North Carolina institution, not  be-
cause there has been a change in the
teams to be played, but for the simple
reason the opposing outfits are greatly
improved over their last season’s lineups.

one of

Since the schedule was published in
the Davidsonian last spring two altera-
tions in the schedule have occurred that
will be of interest to Wildcat followers.
The Duke game has been changed from
the Duke stadium in Durham to Rich-
ardson Field, and the William and Mary
Contest originally scheduled to be played
on Saturday, November 3rd, will take
place on Thursday, November Ist.
Only three of the Wildcat engage-
ments will be played away from David-
son, consequently there are six encoun-
ters booked for Richardson Field. The
teams to be met on foreign soil are:
North Carolina State at Greensboro;
The United States Military Academy, at
West Point, New York, and The Cita-
del, at Charleston.

The schedule is as follows:

Sept. 22—Elon at Davidson.

DAVIDSON OPENS SEASON
AGAINST ELON SATURDAY

Elon Expected To Present A Very
Strong Team This Year

NEWTON OUT FOR YEAR

Davidson will. open its 1934 football
season on next Saturday, September 22,
against Elon College. With eleven let-
ter men returning for grid action, this
fall and with the strongest aggregation
Coach Newton has had in recent years
the outlook for the season is distinctly
promising.

The Wildcats, led by Captain Johnny
Mackorell, of whom much is to be ex-
pected in this, his last season, will be-
gin their 1934 crusade against Coach
“Pea-llead” Martin’s Little Six cham-
pions of last year. Coach Martin has
been drilling his men hard and it is ex-
pected that the, Wildcats will have no
little trouble staving off the fighting
spirit of little Elon.

Davidson barely emerged the 6-0 win-
ner in the close contest last year and
Elon can certainly not be taken lightly
in this first game. Elon was to open
thetr season last Saturday with Roanoke
College, but were rained out and the
Davidson coaches have not had a chance
to look over Coach Martin’s tactics.

Elon put out a fine smooth-running
eleven last year and they have very
nearly the same aggregation to take the
field against the Wildcats Saturday.
The Wildeats will be undoubtedly weak-
ened by the loss of John Newton, out-
standing end prospect, who, because of

hip injuries, has been forced to quit
football. It had been bothering him for
some time and the doctors advised

against football for the time being. Fol-
lowing are the lettermen returning and
who will probably see action Saturday
in the opening tilt and all season: Mor-
gan and Windham, ends; Siewers and
Cathey, tackles; Hand and Potter,
guards; and J. B. Lee, center. The back-
field will be intact with Mackorell,
Wingfield and Hutchins doing most of
the ball carrying.
