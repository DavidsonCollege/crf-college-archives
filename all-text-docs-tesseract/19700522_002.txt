Play-Right

The Davidson College Statement of
Purpose is a document of exceeding
wonder and inspiration. Not only does
it use over twenty religious words,
but it even dares to paraphrase the
Bible (e.g., “To it has been given
much, and of it much will be re- ®
quired.’’)

It seems however, that some stu-
dents are not to be allowed this same
freedom of expression with regard
to their own religious views. We re-
fer to the case of Will Ravenel. who
apparently will not be allowed to pre-
sent publicly an original play ex-
hibiting some of his views toward the
Christian experience. ,..

Even worse is the fact that the
student is being flagrantly denied
his full right of academic freedom —
a freedom supported in that same
statement of purpose. Although the
statement of purpose claims David-
son tries to teach students “to com-
municate freely with others in the
realm of ideas,” the actions of the
administration in limiting the perfor-
mance of Ravenel’s play border on
outright censorship.

The same right of academic freedom
is guaranteed in the Code of Responsi-
bility (or so we thought) when it says,
“Indispensable to the attainment of
this aim (the pursuit of truth) is a
spirit of free sedatey and expression
in which members of the college com-
munity are expected to develop the
capacity for critical judgment and to
engage in a sustained and independent
search for truth.”

Yet Ravenel will apparently be al-
lowed to engage in this “free inquiry

“and expression” only at a time and

place and under circumstances dic
tated by the administration.

Lhe logic behind the restrictions
on Ravenel apparently involves the
reaction which the “continuing col-
lege community” fears it would get
from persons outside the campus.

They apparently feel that college-
church, college-community, and to

‘be realistic, college-benefactor rela-

tionships would be damaged. Not only
are these fears petty, they ignore the
purpose of the college as a liberal
arts institution functioning to pre-
serve learning even in a community
where such learning may not exist.

The real reason behind the admin-
istrative repression of Ravenel’s play
seems to be the same sort of personal
morality judgments on the part of
some high officials who have used
this morality against similar issues
in the not so distant past:

It-seems quite true that the college
could allow many activities without
being blamed for supporting some of
the less desirous effects of these ac-
tivities. ~*

In summary this college should up-
hold its liberal educational ideals or
get out of the education business;
hypocrisy has no place in an educa-
tional institution. Either that or we
as students might turn to more inof-

fensive subjects — anyone for fin- .

gerpainting the Creation?

Faith In The System

We find it quite disheartening that,
as we have heard lately, a slight min-
ority of the Honor Court and some
few faculty members think that self-
scheduled exams -will put an undue
strain on the honor system. :

Not that the current SGA proposal
is perfect; in fact, it is somewhat too
rule-oriented. However, these many
rules will probably wear down event-
ually and be made more convenient:
as soon as the system is tried and
proven successful several times. And
it does indeed eliminate a system of
exam scheduling which is invariably
too concentrated or too spread out.

But the problem seen by most —
at least among those Who see a prob-
lem — is the possible effect on the
honor system. We find. the little
faith in the students and the honor
system that this argument expresses
very hard to accept at best and com-
pletely disillusioning at worst.

As far as the: system goes, we re
peat the statement of one of the more
enlightened honor court members:
“if we refuse to. put the Honor Code
to the test, the the only reason for

having such a code is for show.”
We are shaken even to draw the

* implications regarding some faculty

members’ faith in the students.

A majority of the Honor Court has
formally expressed its approval of
the proposed system. Moreover, simi-
lar systems—some even more loose;
ly controlled—have worked at many
other schodls and this evidence has
been cited by the SGA before the
faculty Educational Policy Committee.

We concur with the SGA in argu-
ing that seeking to avoid such situa-
tions as would be created by self-
scheduled exams “because they might
require greater reliance on the pled-
ges of the honor system” is “tacitly
admitting that the honor system is
unworkable.” This is diametrically op-
posed to the faith expressed in the
students by the Honor Code and the
Code of Responsibility.

Hopefully, the Educational Policy
Committee and then the full faculty
will see its way clear to reaffirming
its faith in the students and the phil-
osophy of a community effort towards
education as expressed in the Code.

Yet Another?

SGA President Ran Coble’s ombuds-
man proposal is an interesting new
way of effectively channelling stu-
dent grievances into significant ac-
tion.

The Ombudsman Panel, according
to the plan now under consideration,
will involve students, faculty and
members of the administration in an
effort to break-through red tape and
obtain the quickest possible action
on student complaints and sugges-
tions.

The proposal itself, however, con-
tains a number of weaknesses which
could severely hamper the effective-
ness of the Ombudsman Panel. In
the first place, the panel’s size and
composition may undermine its ef-
fectiveness. All is not always sweet-
ness and light between the various
facets of the Davidson community,
and it is not beyond the realm of pos-
‘sibility that the members of the panel
might disagree. Since the committee
has four members and no chairman
to cast a deciding vote, deadlock is
a very real possibility.

More importantly, the panel, -even
if it does agree, has no power to take
decisive action. It can only make
recommendations, recommendations
which still have to be taken through
the “proper. channels” ‘to attain’ real-
ity. Without strong aupport from.
above, red tape would still be an im-

B.C.

portant factor in the production of
change on the campus. This being the
case, the Ombudsman Panel would not
have fulfilled its promises and would
become another of Davidson’s bog-
ged-down committees.

It therefore seems that the present
proposal contains grave impediments
to its own success. \

Accepting the assumption that the
Ombudsman Panel might ultimately
bea force in-campus_life, the ques-
tion of the need for a student Senate
would certainly come up.

However, it is not only the struc-
ture. of the present student organiza-
tions that would be questioned with
the success of an Ombudsman Panel
but also. the structure of faculty, ad-
ministrative, and trustee organiza-
tions. Definite room for change exists
in these areas, a fact which seems
to have been recognized by the trus-
tees when they recently established
a committee. to review all forms of
campus governance.

Such a complete overhaul of the
entire present system seems to be
much more desired than the sort of
addition to already existing structure
that would be entailed, by the approv-
al of Coble’s plan. Students definitely
need a way to cut the red tape now
blocking change, but another com-
mittee-panel hardly seems to be the
answer.

But What Will They Think Of Your Play, Mr. Ravenel?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

HIRST

Students Favor Tenure;

Medical Policy Backed

To the Editor:

The recent report of the
Academy for Educational
Development recommends
that Davidson College re-
duce the percentage of fac-
ulty on tenure. We are con-
cerned about the possibili-
ty that Davidson will deny
tenure to highly qualified
teachers in order to achieve
the «recommended percent-
age as rapidly as possible.

It should be recognized
that the present situation is
the result of a tenure policy
that has been in effect for
years. To attempt to recti-
fy the situation in a short
period of time by denying
tenure to experienced and
qualified teachers certain
ly is not the solution. The
problem was created over a
period of time and it should
be solved over a period of
time. , :

An| additional considera-
tion is the recommendation
that Davidson increase its
student enrollment in the
near future, which might
occur as part of the intro
duction of coeducation. This
would provide an automatic
and natural way to reduce
the percentage of faculty on
tenure, as new faculty would
have to be‘hired.

Davidson should be more
selective in conferring ten-
ure than it has in the past,
but this does not mean it
should let. good men go
merely in order to achieve
quickly a particular percent
age.

To the Editor:

I read with great concern
the article appearing in last
week's DAVIDSONIAN -con-
cerning records procedures
for the college infirmary.

Nat only do I believe that
the professional duty of Dr.
Davis would be severely re-
stricted by a college policy
that requires indiscriminate
reporting of medical re-
cords of individual students
to the Dean of Student's
Housing and Chaplain's of-
fices, but I also consider
this a violation of students’
legal rights.

Though I can by no
means claim a legal exper-
tise, it seems that. ample
precedent has been estab-
lished to validate Dr. Davis’
position. To quote the Po-
licy Guide of the American
Civil Liberties Union: ‘In
their non-academic life stu-
dents should be free from
college control.

“In his private status a
student should not be sub-
ject to punitive measures
by the college, unless the
college can prove, in the
course .of a hearing with
due process safeguards, that
he has acted in a way
which adversely affects or

seriously interferes with its
normal educational function
or which injures or en-
dangers the welfare of any
of its other members.”

The infirmary is a col-
lege offered service to stu-
dents—an essential service
—but should not be confus-
ed in any way with the
formal academic life of stu-
dents.

Further, the argument
that the college has report-
edly never used medical in-
formation in a punitive fash-
ion toward students is in-
sufficient argument to main-
tain that making such in-
formation available to re-
cord keeping officials of the

Logic In CRC Decision

To the Editor:

Since the beginning of the
controversy that brought the
Ad Hoc Committee for the
Protection of Students into
being, a metaphor has been
running through my mind
which it now seems appro-
priate to express.

With regard to the incre-
dible rule on summer school
credit for summer 1968, it
seems that the students have
caught the administration

by Johnny hart

with their pants down, so to
speak.

We are reminded of old
Noah who emerged from the
ark with a dessicating thirst.
He planted a vineyard, and
when the fruit of the vine
was ready, he gratified him-
self to such an extent that he
was soon frolicking about
naked.

When his son saw him, he
quickly got a blanket to cov-

er his exposed father. In |

light of the fact that some-
one sinned in the encounter,
it was a question of whether
to punish the naked father or
the son who had discovered
him. In accordance with Old
Testament logic, it was the
son who was punished.
Compared to the Davidson
situation, this parallel seems
to be working out with the

ity winning out once again.

The professional compet-

“Critize, condemn, castigate, and callously cruci-

ng constructive for a change?

Though variously phrased, that is the message

friends and antagonists and people
I've never met are delivering to me «
personally and as a dissident stu-

dent.

Many of the things which con-
cern me and my fellows are ugly,
dirty, reprehensibte, and even‘ evil.
And dirty things have dirty names

The point is that we should call

ROWLAND

If that sounds hypercynical here

are a few suggestions:

Read, watch, and listen to the news and see if
you find the shape the world’s y thls

Or, if you’re an anti-medi

man, check out Paul

Harvey” Spiro Agnew, WBT and WIST editoréals, and
see if you find them sources of positive delight and

gaiety.

Ride a bus and talk to servicemen afraid they're

about to be shipped to their deaths. See whether body

counts bother you when they include your friends.
Try to get an apartment in Charlotte and when

they ask whether you’re white, say no and see how

fast they hang up.

Or ... Well, pick your own experiment and see
if you don’t find shockingly many Americans intoler-
ant and hostile to life styles even superficially different

from their own.

For example, the UNCC student body president
recently spoke to a Charlotte civic club on Cambodia,
Kent State and other things; his speech was followed
by suggestions from the audience that he leave the
country if he didn’t like things as they are.

As a reporter I once observed similar treatment
of a Quaker group at an Augusta civic club luncheon.
That same summer I heard the police department’s
public relations chief tell a similar group what good
relations they. had with the black community. The
businessmen left their lunch content that the local
big id knew their place and assured that riots were
a Northern plague. They labor under that illusion no

more. z
So don’t tell me ‘to

adopt the impercipient rhe-

toric of ‘the political positivist.

Synchatogormania, the attachment of “happy”
words to neutral or even morally reprehensible ideas
might make you feel better but it doesn’t do much

toward righting* wrongs.

Anderson Criticizes Dean;
Sweatt Petitions McNair

To the Editor:

Dean Johnston was asked
in an open meeting of the
faculty Monday by another
member of the college ad-
ministration whether it
might not be a good idea
to delay—the faculty vote on
the extended studies pro
gram until adequate publi-
city could“be given the pro-
posal. ps :
~ The dean of faculty re-
plied that he did think that
adequate publicity had been
given, that he was dismay-
ed at the low attendance of
students. at the faculty's
open meeting, and that edu-
cational policy should not
be made in THE DAVID-
SONIAN,

Apparently the dean
hasn't been following his
own ,committee proceedings
too carefully, for a commit-
tee member told me_ that
students were not invited to
the. meeting when the Edu-
cational Policy Committee
requested it. It was to be
an EPC meeting open to
faculty.

There was no_ publicity
for the meeting, and _ the
purpose of the meeting was
never stated to students.
Some of the students pre-
sent had come in without
even knowing the topic of
discussion.

To say that adequate pub- -

licity had been given is
about as credible as_ the
President's justification of
the Cambodian invasion.

But the dean also said he
did not think educational
policy should be made in
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

I wonder where he wants
it made. In closed faculty
meetings where a_ special
priesthood: deliberates over
the issue of students’ fate?

Sorry, Dr. Johnston, but
it is our lives, our educa-
tions that are at stake. If
anyone should know how
educational policy is form-
ulated, students should.

Your secret meetings,
your mystical ways of de-
veloping educational policy
through the priesthood of
faculty that you referred to
On page one of the Blue
Sky Report, have no place
in a liberal arts college.

If you want to run a col-
lege that way, go to Bob
Jones, or get a job with
the vice - president. They'll
welcome you.

The following statement
was sent to Governor Rob-
ert E. McNair of South Car-
olina after last Friday's sit-
in at the Union. Copies of
this expression of sympathy
were also sent to the presi-
dent of the student body and
to the student Newspaper at
South Carolina.

“We are staging a one-
hour sit-in here at David-
son this morning to em-
phasize our concern and
our sympathy for students
at the University of South
Carolina.

“We are appalied at
the arrsets of forty-one
students during a sit-in at
their student union last
week, We fail to see why
those students were forcibly
removed from their own
student union and then
charged with trespass.

“Also, we are unable to
accept Governor Robert E.
‘MeNair’s orders denying
students’ the right of peace-
ful assembly, a right grant-
ed by the first amendment
of the Constitutional of the
United States of America.
“Further, we condemn the
action of Tuesday night in
which more than one hun-
dred students were forced
to spend the night in state
prison following arrest and
harassment by law enforce-
ment officers.

“According to The Char-
lotte Osberver of Thursday,
May 14, ‘The men_ were

LETTERS

taken to the State Depart-
ment of Corrections and,
regardless of the length
of their hair, shaved and
then sprayed with disinfect-
ant and given prison uni-
forms.’

“Particularly offensive is
the fact that many of those
students so treated were un
involved in the alleged dis-
turbances, a grim reminder
of the senseless slayings of
four students at Kent State
last week.

“So we are staging our
own sit-in here this ‘morning
to. show officials in “South
Carolina that students have
a right to use their own stu-
dent unions as forums for
free expression.

“We hope that the pres
ence of national guardsmen
and state police on their
campus will not result in
yet another senseless
slaughter of students.”

An Associated Press story
written last Friday quoted
MeNair's press secretary as
having said that McNair
had received over 100 letters
and telegrams about the
events described above—all
endorsing McNair's actions
and urging elimination of
campus troublemakers.

If you feel differently
about this, particularly if
you are a South Carolinian,
please make your feelings
known to MeNair.

Tt was an unfortunate er-

To the Editor:
Perhaps you have heard
about the mysterious non-

play currently looking for a

a place to put itself on. It
is in difficulty apparently be-
cause it is felt to be blas-
phemous.

This criticism is too strong.
I admit that to parody Shake-
speare is in bad taste and
maybe even irreverent. But
blasphemous? Certainly not.
In the context of miscellan-
eous crimes against poetry
which are committed around
here year after year, this .
new one is surely tolerable.

As for the plot, it is an
innocuous thing about an ad-

‘olescent, his pimples, and his
