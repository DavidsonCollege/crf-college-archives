Wednesday, November 1, 1989 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Charlotte Knights to move to Davidson?

By GIGGY MAXWELL

In a couple of weeks we will be cele-
brating the opening of the new Baker
Sports Complex, the superstructure
that is supposed to send Davidson ath-
letics hurtling into the 21st century. If
you have seen the plans for the building
or had a chance to tour it, it’s hard to
deny that the Complex is anything less
than incredible. But is it practical?

For the Davidson baseball team, and
both soccer teams, the answer is no.
These three programs play and practice
in the most remote areas of the campus
and, for them, the Baker Sports Com-
plex will actually become a nuisance.

Now the lockerroom facilities for these
teams will be located even further from
their playing fields, which means more
time devoted tojust getting to and from
practice on a daily basis. Equipment
willhave tobe lugged a greater distance
as well. While every other sport enjoys
the modern confines of the Baker Sports
Complex, baseball and soccer will con-
tinue to pack fans on to pre-World War
II stands that have already proven
dangerous (one fan actually fell
through the bleachers last year). The
baseball and soccer press box will con-
tinue to consist of a table and refresh-
ments will continue to be served out of

10-19.

These programs have had a good
amount of success, yet they still have
facilities which are way below par in
terms of what the teams they compete
against have to offer. The bottom line is
that these programs need their own
facilities closer to their playing fields.

But building such facilities from
scratch would be both expensive and
impractical. The Charlotte Knights AA
baseball team has the answer for us.

Two years ago, George Shinn, also
owner of the Charlotte Hornets, pur-
chased the then Charlotte O’s from the
Crockett family. Crockett Park, which
had previously housed the O’s, had just
recently burned to the ground. Upon
purchasing the team Shinn decided to
move the team to Gold Hills, South
Carolina to a 10,000 seat multipurpose
stadium thathe was constructing. Since
this new ballpark would not be func-
tional in time for the 1989 season, a
temporary facility was built. Now the
renamed Knights are ready to move in
to their new stadium and the Knight's
brass is looking to unload their tempo-
rary facilities at much less than the
original cost.

Men’s soccer coach Charlie Slagle
and baseball coach Jim Stoeckel have
been working with a group of alumni
whoarea part of the Davidson Baseball
Interest Group in an effort to obtain
some, or all of these facilities for the
college.

Exactly what do these facilities con-

_ sist of?

— seating for 4,000 persons
—— a press box area
nit z= beth a, home and visitors club-

— Shower facilities
— a training area

7
— laundry facilities
— coaches offices
— bathrooms for men and women
spectators.
— storage areas
— lighting

— 2 portable concession stands

These are by no means expensive
buildiags but they would be very func-
tional for the aforementioned teams
and, according to initial surveys, would
fit well into the Davidson surround-
ings.

“Not only will these facilities help
out the baseball, soccer and golf pro-
grams,” reasoned Coach Stoeckel, “but
the student body asa whole will benefit
in a number of ways: We'll be able to
provide a more pleasant setting for fans
to watch a game; the outdoor IMAC
activities will have storage space-that is
much closer to their playing fields;
having bathroom facilities out there
will be of great benefit to spectators,
golfers and IMAC athletes alike.”

If Davidson (that includes you, the
student) decides it does want to pur-
chase some orall of these facilities, it has
to do so soon and make the Knights an
offer to start the ball rolling. Initial talks
with Davidson higher-ups have been
positive in this regard and more specific
details should be forthcoming in the
next few weeks.

“You've got to remember,” added
Stoeckel, “we're not talking about a $2.5
million-dollar stadium like Wake For-
est has, and we’re not asking for a rep-
lica of the Toronto Blue Jays Sky Dome.
Wejust feel that purchasing these facili-
ties would goa long way to completing
what the Baker Sports Complex has
started in updating and making
Davidson sports facilities some of the
nicest there are for a school this size.”
