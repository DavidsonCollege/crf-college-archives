Looking down the road: t

Rob Spach

he Davidson Trustee Dilemma.

Conristiansaren’tbetter than any-
body else. They’re not necessarily
more honest; they’re not more
moral; they don’t do more good in
the world than anyone else. So,
why would Davidson College in-
sist that its trustees be practicing
members of a Christian church?

I think the question is a good
one, one we’ve got to reflect on,
whether we decide to alter the
policy ornot. I’ve read the articles
urging the Christian trustees to do
unto others as they would have
others do unto them. I’ve met fine,
caring people who will graduate or
have graduated from this fine in-
stitution and would make good
trustees, but who are not Chris-

tians. On the face of it, it seems
unfair for them to be barred from
serving as trustees just because of
their religious beliefs.

So, why am I unsure whether
or not the policy should be altered?
I look down the road not ten years
but fifty years, one hundred years,
and I’m sure the character of this
college will change. That’s inevi-
table; it is, in fact, good and as it
should be. It would be a lousy
educational institution if it were
stagnant.

But in what directions will it
change? In large measure, the an-
swer to that question lies in the
hands of the trustees. I argued in
these pages not long ago that

whether we do so consciously or
not, we root ourselves in a tradi-
tion. Atthe moment, we are rooted
in the Christian tradition. Some—
many, perhaps—may not agree
with me that that is good, but that’s
the way itis. .

If we change the policy on
trustee membership in a Christian
church, we probably won’t see
much of an effect for a couple of
decades. But over time, the tradi-
tion to which most of the trustees
ascribe would probably change;
realistically, I would guess a larger
and larger number would be secu-
larists.

Inevitably, the tradition that
shapes the character of this college

would also change. If that tradi-
tion becomes secularist in nature,
as it has at many of the other schools
to which we compare ourselves,
then the Christian tradition which
has shaped our identity will be-
come merely ornamental.

Now, Iam not opposed tosecu-
larism from the get-go; in fact,
there’s no doubt in my mind that
secularism has benefitted the acad-
emy greatly over the past century,
promoting higher levels of profes-
sionalism than existed when most
college professors were clergy.
And there is no doubt that the con-
tributions of secularism are going
to continue to influence Davidson
in positive ways, no matter what.

But secularism also has its
shortcomings—areasin which it is
lacking. One of those areas is.
spirituality. The spiritual values
such as justice, charity, humility,
and service which underlie educa-
tion at its best are not inherent to
secularism, and if this college were
to become secular, those values
would lose the strong basis they
currently enjoy here,

Moreover, by shifting away
from the Christian tradition, we
will end up lessening th: diversity
that exists in higher education. I
look at academia in America and I
see a polarization occurring which

day, same outfit.

Oray, Davidson—you can brag
all you want about your 1300 SAT
scores and about how only 1% of
applicants get in this school, but
now the student body has really let
me down. Davidson students, you
may have IQs of 175, but you don’t
notice anything unless it will be on
a test.

Let me back up a bit. I’ve

already gone on record saying that
clothing is ridiculous and unneces- ©

sary except when it’s cold out.
I’ve yelled at the Forces of Fashion
who cause freshwomen to stick
keys in their back pockets. I wanted
to prove to myself that it was the
rest of the world who was crazy
while I remain in my tower of
sanity. I decided on an experi-
ment. :
I chose an outfit to my liking:
a garish plaid flannel (I just can’t
believe that grunge is dead), pre-
stained blue jeans, green Chucks
with Perma-Smell (from the mak-
ers of Dura-Shears), and, to top it
all off, (I just love puns) a black
Davidson Tennis hat turned around
backwards a la Dan Cortese. I
wore this outfit for a solid week.
Istarted wearing this outfit on
Saturday. My original plan was to
wear it until someone noticed. I
was prepared to go to graduation in
these garments if need be. I’msure
my parents would have been over-
joyed to be able to pick their son
out in the sea of black robes—the
Seay within the sea (I kill myself).
My plan of going until gradu-
ation was spoiled after going out
Thursday night to Backstreet. My
roommates informed me that I
“reeked of beer and cigarettes.” I
can smell you from twenty feet
away.” Unfortunately, they told
me this only after I sat next to my
professors in two of my classes on
Friday. This was a blessing in
disguise because I had to dress up
as Lorenzo Lamas on Friday night,
which only reinforced to me why
tight jeans are all the rage in hell.
I did nothing else unusual the
whole week. I went out as often as
I possibly could. I went to all my

classes and tried desperately to
think of witty things to say to feed
my need for attention. I tried to act
as normal as possible, bracing
myself for strange looks or at least
a great reluctance of people to sit
close to me. But much to my
surprise, nobody said anything to

‘me. There are three possible ex-
planations for nobody notifying

me of my extremely limited ward-
robe:

1) People are scared of me.
They’re afraid that I will break
anyone like a twig who even dares
to smile and say hello.

Although I am cut like Jean-
Claude Van Damme, I usually walk
around with a stupid-looking grin
on my face. I say hello to every-
body I can and generally try to act
as completely harmless as I actu-
ally am. Therefore, I discounted
my first explanation.

2) Nobody pays any attention
to me whatsoever. I could go to
class with my hair on fire and
wouldn’t get a response.

The first sentence is a given,
but I think that people would look
at me with my hair on fire. People
eventually pay attention to anyone
who does the same thing over and
over again. Just look at Jeffrey
Dahmer. It took dozens of repeti-
tions of his daily routine before
anyone noticed.

3) Davidson students are the —

least observant people this side of

Where is the real world?

Tpodentand that figuring out what
to do with the rest of your life is a
pretty important matter. But why
do people have to let it have a
detrimental effect on the current
life they are living?

I can name ten people off the
top of my. head that right now are
so apathetic about Davidson that I
hardly know they go here.

Some of them are on athletic
teams but barely give fifty percent
in practice. Oth-

no reason to try anymore in school
because there are many more im-
portant things to worry about—
like preparing for this real world
that everyone keeps talking about.

I guess this is where the apa-
thy thing comes into play because,
according to most people here,
apathy means sophistication.

I guess if all of this sophistica-
tion stuff is true then I am about as
immature as one can get. Maybe
it’s just me, but it

rience as they I like practicing

used to be. They
tell me that they have more impor-
tant things to do—like worry about
the “real world.”

Excuse me, but could some-
one please tell me what the real
world is? I think I’m confused.

You see, as I understand it,
once I graduate from Davidson,
I’m going -to be thrown into the
world of grown-up people and so-
phistication.

Henceforth, the later years of
Davidson are child’s play. There’s

I can so I can be the best player
possible. I like writing for the
newspaper to improve my writing.
I like studying and learning about
the world I live in.

The way I see it is that we’ve
got the entire rest of our lives to
figure out what we’re going to do
in the real world.

We only have these four years
to figure out how to enjoy college
and make the most of it. But maybe
that’s just me.

Gull's Nest:
Bill Gullan

Teach the ©
poor to bake.

The question is this: what was
Kim Kreiling thinking? In her
column of last week (immediately
above mine), she advocated “a sys-
tem of socialized housing” to com-
bat this homelessness problem ev-
eryone seems to talk about.

She begins by saying that the

- --problems of drug addiction, alco-

holism, and mental illness “are not
the issue here.” She perceives the
homeless problem as a shortage of
affordable housing. She goes as
far as quoting former Mayor
Dinkins of New York, that great
champion of the underprivileged,
who was booted out of office in
November for, among otherthings,
being out of touch with the con-
cerns of the voters.

Dinkins aside, Kreiling then
states unbelievably that the prob-
lem is “the failure of government
to meet that basic need” of hous-
ing. Is she actually saying that the
government is responsible for
housing the people? I suppose so,
for she says later that housing is a
“human right.”

Well, I remember when the
city of San Francisco produced a
videotape forhomeless men teach-
ing them how to eat out of
dumpsters. No joke, this was pro-
duced because many homeless
people’s “dignity” prevents them
from going to the numerous gov-
ernment shelters and soup kitch-
ens in every major city. I suppose
that a VCR mustalso be a “human
right” and a “need the government
is failing to meet,” since homeless
people must have one to view this
ironic videotape.

Kreiling, undaunted, contin-
ues. She states, “We cannot stand
by, watching the gap between rich
and poor increase.”

I would understand her con-
cern if the poor were actually get-
ting poorer, but why complain
about the gap? Why, if both ex-
tremes are benefiting, is this situa-
tion intolerable?
