Week in Washington
Dole fends off primary challengers

By Davip SANTSCHI
Washington Week Correspondent

Following a disappointing
performance in the Super Tuesday
primaries across the South, Steve
-. Forbes announced Friday thathe is
dropping out of the Republican
presidential race.

Except for Florida, where he
placed second behind Dole, Forbes
finished no higher than third in
seven primaries held Tuesday.
Forbes won 71 Republican del-
egates, less than 10% of the num-
ber needed to clinch the nomina-
tion. These delegates were also
expensive: Forbes spent a record
$25 to $30 million of his personal
fortune on the campaign.

Forbes was urged by several
friends, including New Jersey Gov-
ernor Christine Todd Whitman, to
withdraw and unite the party be-
hind Senator Bob Dole (R-KS),
the apparent Republican nominee.

Despite his harsh television
commercials that condemned
Dole’s record, Forbes endorsed him
Friday. ‘Senator Dole has truly
earned our support and help,”
Forbes said. Dole, having amassed
709 of the 996 delegates needed to
win the nomination, was relieved
that another challenger had with-
drawn.

“No doubt about it, it helps,”
Dole said.

Forbes’ bid’ showed the pres-
ence. of a large supply-side wing in
the Republican party that is un-
comfortable with the Republican
fixation on budget cutting. Forbes
railed against “root canal” Repub-

licanism with his upbeat message .

that promised renewed growth and
opportunity through revamped tax
code and a less conservative social
policy. While no longer in the
race, Forbes said, “I will work with
others to promote those pro-op-
portunity, pro-growth, pro-Ameri-
can ideals.”

In a campaign stop in Battle
Creek, Michigan, Dole urged Re-
publicans to “focus our attention
on what we believe we should do
in November, and that is to beat
Bill Clinton.” While portraying
himself as.“the undisputed oppo-
nent of Bill Clinton,” Dole also
hinted at the themes he will use in
the next few months.

First, Dole intends to make
character a major issue. Appear-
ing at the site of an army hospital
where he recovered between 1945
and 1948 from a World War II
injury, Dole obviously wanted to
distinguish his service with
Clinton’s protest against the Viet-
nam War. :

“It is about character. It is
about growing up in America.
About having made a little sacri-
fice for America,” Dole said.

Second, Dole will try to con-
vince blue-collar Reagan Demo-
crats that Republican proposals are
better equipped to ease economic
and job-related uncertainty. Third,
he will paint Clinton as an obstruc-
tionist to Republican efforts on
welfare reform and a balanced bud-
get.

Meanwhile, Pat Buchanan re-
fuses to pull out of the race.
Buchanan is comfortable with his

self-proclaimed role as a
“countercultural icon” and wants
to influence the policies and tone
of the Republican convention in
San Diego. He has spoken re-

cently about running again in the ~
year 2000 and drew parallels be- ©

tween himself and Ronald Reagan,
claiming that “what 1976 was for
Ronald Reagan, 1996 can be and is
to Pat Buchanan.”

In Washington, congressional
Republicans agreed to include a
version of the line-item veto in a
bill that would extend the debt
ceiling.

‘This action came largely
through the efforts of Dole, who
prodded House and Senate Repub-
licans to compromise. The issue
stalled because Republicans, the
majority party in Congress, were
reluctant to grant such authority to
a Democratic president.

The bill would allow the presi-
dent to reduce or remove any fig-
ures in a spending bill. A two-
thirds vote by hoth houses of Con-
gress would be required to over-
ride a presidential decision. There-
fore, each spending bill would be
broken up into hundreds of small
bills which the president would
consider individually.

Although 43 of 50 state gov-
ernors have a line-item veto, there
are concerns that it would compli-
cate the legislative process and shift
a great deal of constitutional power
from Congress to the president.

Global Perspective
Suicide bombings bring
peace-efforts to front doors

By Eric Sapp
Dean Rusk Adjunct Reporter

The most intimidating enemy
is the one that you cannot see.
There is an awful fear in the knowl-
edge that anywhere you go and at
any time of the day, a bomb could
kill you or your loved ones. While
Davidson students were on Spring
Break, four suicide bombings made
that fear.a reality for the people of
Israel.

HAMAS, the extreme Islamic
terrorist group, claimed responsi-
bility for the four suicide bomb-
ings which killed more than 60
people. HAMAS is the Arabic
acronym for “Harakat Al-
Muquawama Al-Islamia,” which
means the Brave Islamic Resis-
tance Movement.

The goal of HAMAS is
“Jihad” (holy war). Unlike many
of the pro-Palestinian groups (like
the PLO) who simply want an in-
dependent Palestinian state and are
willing to make concessions to get
it, HAMAS has stated that it will
not stop fighting until all land has
been returned to the Palestinians.

Israel, of course, is not willing
to do this, and so HAMAS has

attempted to everything inits power
to stop the peace process and de-
feat Israel and Arafat. HAMAS
believes that if an independent
Palestinian state is created, Pales-
tinians will lose their will to fight
and that HAMAS’s dream will not
be realized.

HAMAS has focused in on a
very effective way of getting what
they want: suicide bombings of
civilian targets. These attacks
strike at the heart of Israelis and
have had a major impact of the
popularity of Prime Minister
Shimon Peres. Before the recent
wave of suicide attacks which took
place a week ago, Peres had a very
comfortable lead over his Likud
opposition. By the end of the week
his lead had disappeared.

Peres was forced to respond
quickly or lose any chance for re-
election. His response was to
threaten re-occupation of land that
had: been turned over to Arafat if
Arafat did not immediately show
that he was willing and able to stop
terrorism.

Result was an incredible crack:

down on militants and the Pales-
tinian people as a whole. Move-
mentamong Palestinian towns was

denied, and Palestinian and Israeli
police conducted door to door
searches looking for terrorists. The
result was that 350 Palestinian sus-
pects were arrested. Among those
arrested were 4 of the 13 the men
on Israel’s “most wanted” list.

_ This success was desperately
needed by both Peres and Arafat,
but it in no way ensures Peres’
victory in the upcoming elections.

Some analysts contend that
Peres has no chance for re-election
and that the peace. process which
has come so far over the past few
years is on the verge of being de-
stroyed.

But one must keep in mind
that Rabin’s assassination and the
sacrifice he made for peace is still
fresh in people’s minds.

Furthermore, as is being seen
in Northern Ireland, once people
get a taste of peace after being at
war their entire lives, it is hard for
them to forget how much better
that life is.

When one adds this to the fact

that. the peace process has come so
far and has such international back-

. ing, it appears that the dove of

peace has been bloodied, but not
killed.

HAMAS attacks Israel

A string of suicide attacks by HAMAS against Israel has thrown
the peace process in the Middle East into disarray. There was a very
strong military and police response by Israel and Arafat’s Security
forces in a mass round up of Islamic militants. Family members of
those involved in the bombings were also arrested and their houses
were destroyed.

US warns China
The United States issued a strong warning to China about missile
tests off the coast of Taiwan and sent a fleet to patrol those waters.
China has been threatening Taiwan in an attempt to alter the outcome
of its upcoming Presidential elections.

Coalition government formed in Turkey
Turkey’s two main centrist parties finally formed a coalition
government. This government excluded the Islamic Welfare party
which had won the most seats in December’s election.

Australian elections held
Australia’s Liberal-National Coalition won Australia’s recent
elections, giving Australia its first conservative government in 13
years.

Spring Moisturizing Treatments with Eggs

Your hair, skin, and nails have been under attack. The dry heat
in your dorms, classrooms combined with the winter’s chilling
weather has caused your skin to become dry, itchy, and flaky.

It’s maddening to buy a product you think will be great and then
find out it doesn’t work at all. Rather than go through all that hassle,
why not make your own? Putting together a homemade treatment is
easy to do. All of the ingredients are found at the grocery store.

The advantages to making your own treatments is that you and
your friends can share the cost (and fun!), and you make only the
amount you need. Also, the products are natural and won’t irritate
your skin.
Smoothing Foot Mask:

This treatment softens rough calluses and makes feet feel wonder-
fully pampered.

She is interested in “the role
that women play by means of the
printed word in all sorts of publica-
tions and how it affects social, eco-
nomic and religious change.”

Although she will focus on

women in the underground press,
in Nicaragua she hopes to study
“the role of women in the official
press.” She will study political
leader and journalist Violetta
Chomorro.

She believes that it is impor-

tant to study “the mainstream press
in order to understand what the
alternative publications are react-

‘ing to.”

She also plans to study fash-
ion and beauty magazines and how
they contrast with the goals of the
women who create feminist publi-
cations.

“T am basically interested in
women’s rights and how these
countries address them. Many of
these issues, such as divorce, abor-
tion, and sexual harrassment, are
issues that are never discussed in
these cultures.”

Both will begin their studies
mid- summer.
