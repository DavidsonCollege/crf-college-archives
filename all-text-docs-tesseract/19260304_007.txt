Ancient Photos of Davidson Campus
Reveal Many Buildings Now Removed

Of the above pictures, only one is fa-}
miliar to the present student body, and |
that onevis at the top. It is a picture
taken from an old print of the two lit-
erary society halls, Elm Row, and the
Old Chapel. Just beyond the Philan-
thropic Hall, which is the one on the
right, may be seen Elm Row and an-
other building, which was once the home
of Professor Patrick Jones Sparrow, one
of the three who composed the first fac-
ulty of this institution. This building
was removed in 1901, and some of the
materials were used in the building of the
present chapel, Shearer Hall. The small
‘houses beyond the Society Hall, Oak and}
Elk Rows, were, with another, the three
dormitories at the founding of this col-
lege. They had four rooms each, and
four students to a room. The remainder
of the sixty-five stayed at the Steward’s
hall, which is the center picture. It was
of brick, and stood just west of the pres-
ent library, facing toward the south. All
public gatherings were held here, in-
cluding morning and evening prayers,
Sunday services, and the
meetings of the trustees.
