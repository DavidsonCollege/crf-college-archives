MINISTERIAL BAND
HOLDS FEAST FOR
NEW MEMBERS

Last Saturday night will be remem-
bered by every ministerial candidate of
Davidson College as an occasion of pleas-
ure and happiness. A large number of
ministerial students gathered in the
basement of the church to welcome the
new men with a feed.

The table was decorated with red and
black. Streamers hung from the lights,
giving the table an attractive appearance.
The menu consisted of Volstead drinks
with cakes, etc., to match.

After the meal had ben completed, each
candidate introduced the man to his
right, giving his full name, nick name
and home town. In this manner every-
body became acquainted with each other.
Yancy Bowie was the toastmaster for
the evening. His pep and wit kept ev-
ery person expectant to see how he
would introduce the next speaker.

The first speaker of the evening was
Ronald Wilson. His toast was full of
laughs, some at the expense of the
expense of the Freshmen who were pres-
ent. Simp Bryant’s phony choruses were
next introduced. These consisted of
many favorite songs of the band, led by
Bryant himself. A cordial welcome was
given the new men by Hayden Hollings-
worth, who brought out forcibly the
need for men who were able “to endure
hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
Christ.” Spoofy Moffett, president of
the band, gave the next talk. He dealt
directly with the ministerial candidate,
bringing out the characteristics that
should mark a man who is preparing him-
self for the Master’s service.

The last toast was given by Dr. C. M.
Richards. He gave an interesting talk on
the past work of.the band, its organiza-
tion and work in his-college days. The
duty of every candidate to himself, to
his college, and to his God was forcibly

‘Martin Succeeds Patton

Plans for Southern Tour Being Con-
summated—Milhous is New
Manager

Arthur Martin, more popularly known
as “Piggy” has succeeded J. H. Patton,
| resigned, as president of the Davidson
College Glee Club, and his plans for the
| club this year are even more extensive
than those carried to so successful a con-
| clusion by the club on its southern tour
last fall. In his first call for candidates
for the club, much instrumental and vocal
jtalent was discovered in the freshman
class. This new material in addition to
veteran talent promises to make the
club one of the south’s most successful |
college musical organizations. |

An effort is being made to secure Mrs. }
Coral *Hayner Baker, of Charlotte, to
direct the club again this year. Under
her supervision last season, the club was
heralded throughout the states of North
and South, Carolina and Georgia as an
exceptional musical organization, and it
played to packed wherever it
went on its southern tour. |

The usual ‘Stunt Night” will be staged |
in Shearer Hall within the next few
| weeks, proceeds from which will be de- |
voted to financing the organization on its
various tours to neighboring cities and
states. The southern tour, which the |
club expects to make again this fall, will |

expected, the number of Presbyterians great- |
ly exceeds that of the other denominations, |
there being 511 students who are members |
of that church. Of Methodists there are

154; of Baptists 14, of Episcopalians also 14, |

of A. R. P. 7, of Lutherans 5, and of Dis- |
ciples 3. The Friends, Reformed, Moravians
and Christian Church each have one mem-
ber in the student body.

Last year every Davidson man was a mem-

| In the pep meeting held Friday night
before the Elon game the student body
|started off the year with a rip-roaring
demonstration of peppy yelling and old-
time “Down ‘em Wildcat” spirit. It was
a cheer rally plus and old Shearer rock-
ed to the rafters with the cries of the
Wildcats and the Kittens. The Fresh-
men showed the results of the leaders’
efforts in training and large numbers of
upper-classmen were present to go the
new men one better in the point of en-
thusiasm.

The first name given by anyone, asked
as to who was on the hill over the week-
end, has been P. H. Biddle. Everyone
consulted was anxious that mention of
the name of P. H. Biddle be net omitted
from the Davidsonian so that those who

‘failed to greet him on his visit to the

campus may know what they missed,
