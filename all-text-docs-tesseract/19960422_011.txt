Swinging in the Rain

Student and visiting bands frolic in drizzly weather

Student acts take
Spring Folics by storm

While the sun disappeared
by degrees behind an ominous
block of rolling clouds, Richardson
Field slowly drew a crowd of care-
free students. Spring was in the air.
As the first of the student acts
began to set up the stage, air pumps
feeding the circus amusements
roared to life, and pugel-stick wars
and bungee races broke out every-
where. Soda, cookies, pizza, and
even beer found their way into the
hands of eager students. And the

party was only just beginning.
The festivities began at four
o’clock when Chas Victory and
the Desuaves took the stage. The
largest group of the student acts,
their set up included drums, bass,
guitar, harmonica, and vocals, and
it was obvious that their songs were
the product of complex jams. The
resulting sound hinted at both clas-

sic rock and indie-alternative in-

fluences. Without any formal struc-
ture, the songs meandered through
surprisingly tight chord changes
signaled only by a nod from the
guitarist. Occasionally, the lead
singer would retire the cigarette

from his-lips and pump out-a few-

lines of grainy lyrics before return-
ing, with a satisfied grin, to his
former pastime.

The act following was a study
in contrast. Miles Mowry decided
that a seat on the grass looked more
comfortable than any stage and
soon situated himself only acouple
feet from the lounging lookers-on.
With only a guitar and sitar, Miles
kept his music on the side more
mellow. His vocals carried an al-
most placable accent, his mouth
twisting with as much expression
as the lyrics, and much of the crowd
watched transfixed.

With two guitars, three voices,
and a cello, Moxie was next to
‘ grace the stage. Opening with
“Lucky Ball and Chain” by They
Might be Giants, the trio kept their
set fairly upbeat and odd. Guitarist
Nathan Summerlin occasionally
offered comments to the crowd...in
the middle of the songs. Confu-
sion peaked with a jumpy medley
composed of the Vaseline’s
“Molly’s Lips” and “Blister in the
Sun” by the Violent Femmes. The
set closed with a version of
“Cecilia” that alternated between a
cappella vocals and true-to-form
acoustic guitar.

The last act of the afternoon
was Ecdysis. Two voices and a
guitar was all they needed to fill up
their sound, The songs ranged
from self-proclaimed “sassy” (at-
titude in everything from rhythm
to lyrics) to straightforward acous-
ticnumbers. Almostevery melody
had a harmony, and the two wove
their vocals together in sometimes
off-beat, sometimes echoing forms.
Although there was only one acous-
tic guitar, the sound remained full
due to the strong vocals.

Spring Frolics
romps to ‘Da Zippas

Surrounded by the moonwalk
enclosure, tables for making your
own cookie, a beer hut, Q-tip wars,
rubber band racing, a giant game
of kickball, and crowds of frolick-
ing students, The Squirrel Nut Zip-
pers looked strangely at home.
They were dressed to kill (some
time in the mid-70s), and whether
they got their power from the but-
terfly collars or the grease holding
their hair back, something reso-
nated. They had chutzpa.

The stage was packed with
performers (seven to be exact), and
where a performer wasn’t stand-
ing, an instrument was. The drum-
mer sat in the back. Throughout
the show, he wore an expression of
worry, though I could never figure
out why. To his left, the bassist
stood as most bassists stand —ina
perpetual daze, their fingers pluck-
ing at the strings and crawling
across the neck with what looks
like a total lack of
acknowledgement. A female vo-
calist/banjo player (banjoist?)/tam-
bourine guru sat/stood in front of
the bass and spent most of her time
looking a lot like Natalie Mer-
chant. Next to her were the two
lead vocalists. Each played elec-
tric guitar and one of them wore his
only a few inches below his chin.
Trumpet came next, contorting his
face with every insistent note. And
in the back, next to the drummer,

-Sat a man on baritone sax.

Despite the chill and looming
clouds, students flocked to
Richardson as the band played on.

At first, only a small, skeptical
crowd gathered before the stage
but in the course ofa few songs, the
Zippers had collected a mass of
cavorting bodies. The quick beat
and playful attitude lent itself to
dancing. Those present could only
comply, and groups of one, two,
and three hopped this way and that
as if it was their last chance to strut
their stuff.

The music itself was a com-
plex weave of rhythm and style.
Someone told: me the technical
term; swing. Whatever it was, the
Zippers never broke stride. Most
of their songs raced along, horns
jumping in at odd times, guitars
chunking air-tight strokes, but that
didn’t stop them from slowing the
set down every once in a while.

As the sun disappeared, and
the stage lights took its place, the
crowd was tantalized with acouple
moody numbers. The vocalists
suddenly transformed into lounge
singers and I became thoroughly
transfixed. Their voices were in-
credible — dripping with charac-
ter and a twisted earnestness. The
crowd was obviously affected as
well.

After a short huddle, the Zip-
pers ended the show with a couple
more heart-stopping tunes, and the
crowd appreciated it. Waves of
applause from all directions erupted
at their departure.

While the crowd filed from
the field, scooping up free Spring
Frolics 96 mugs on the way out,
the announcement was made that
more fun and excitement was about
to get started with a Latino band in
the 900 Room. Will the fun ever
end?
