FRIEND OF WILSON

Graduated From_ Davidson
1879

On March 9, 1933, one of Davidson’s
most distinguished alumni passed
away. Col. Edward T. Brown, '79,
died at his home in the Mayflower
Hotel in Washington, D, C., from pneu-
monia which he contracted while at-
tending the inauguration of his close
personal and political friend, Franklin
D. Roosevelt, as President of the
United States. The Saturday before
his death Colonel Brown sat on the
reviewing stand with the new Presi-
dent. ©

Born in Gainesville, Ga., in 1858,
Colonel Brown began the practice of

law in Athens, Ga., following his grad-| Carolina Synod, when it held its 120tI*

uation from Davidson in 1879. He
later moved to Atlanta where he was
senior member of the firm of Brown
and Randolph. While there he was
made a lieutenant-colonel on the gov-
ernor’s staff,

A first cousin of Woodrow Wilson’s
first wife, Brown became a close per-
sonal friend of the wartime President,
as well as a political ally. He was
tendered several high governmental
posts, but refused them, preferring to
remain a private citizen. For” many
years he was chairman of the State
Democratic Committee of Georgia.

This distinguished Davidson alumnus
had a large part in the development
of the cave section of the Shenandoah
Valley. In 1919 he purchased Endless
Caverns, and developed it into a fa-
mous resort.

During Wilson’s stay at the White
House, Brown spent much of his time
there, and the two men were com-
panions on numerous golf expeditions.

Colonel Brown was buried in Ath-
ens, Ga. He is survived by a son, Ma-|
jor Edward M. Brown, and a daugh-|
ter, Mrs. Marjorie King. |

Davidson College figured quite prom-
inently in the recent meeting of the
Synod of North Carolina which was
held in Greensboro. The Church of
the Covenant, of which Rev. R. Mur-

host to the Synod, although most of
the meetings were held in the build-
ings of the Woman's College at
Greensboro, Many of the leading min-
isters at the meeting were members
of the alumni body. At the opening
of the assembly Claude T. Carr, ’98,
