Like Women? Apply
To Exchange Program

What's it like to be surrounded
by seven hundred or more wo-
men? It doesn’t happen at Dav-
idson but it does at Hollins, Ma-

ry Baldwin, Randolph-Macon
Woman's, and Sweet Briar.
These schools, and Davidson,

Hampden-Sydney, Randolph-Ma-
con, and Washington and Lee,
are members of Exchange, A
College Consortium.

The Eight College Exchange
allows students at these schools
to attend one of the other schools
for a year as a special student
while still being enrolled at his
home institution.

The purposes of the Exchange
are to broaden educational op-
portunities, to provide a diverse
campus environment for the
students visiting the campuses
and for the students who re-
main on their campuses, and
as an initial limited experi-
ment in co-operation among
these colleges.

The program began last year
as eight girls came to Davidson
and several Davidson men ex-
perienced a year at women’s
colleges. The co-eds in Grey
House are involved in the Con-
sortium.

The Exchange lis designed
for a student’s junior year, and
for a full academic year, but
sophomores are eligible for the
program and_ shorter periods
of time will be considered. Pre-
medical majors are advised to
go during their sophomore year.

Eligibility is determined by
the home schools and final ap-
proval by mutual agreement
between the host and home in-
Stitutions. Past experience in-
dicates that almost all appli-
cants for the program are ac-
cepted. No minimum §grade-
point average is needed.

Pee SRE at ha CR

approved in advance by the
home institution. The host
school assures him of enroll-
ment in these courses. All aca-
demic rules of the host ‘school
apply to exchange students.

Grades are accepted at face
value with the permanent re-
cord showing where the course
was taken. Pass/fail options are
recognized by Davidson.

A full program at the host
school is recognized as a full
program at. the home school
even if the courses or credits
are fewer or more than the case
at the home school.

The exchange student is ex-
pected to abide by the host
institution’s rules and regula-
tions, but there are exceptions
in some cases. The Honor Code
and Student Government Courts
of the host school are enforced
on exchange students.

Applications must be submit-
ted to Director of Instructional
Development Jay Ostwalt by 5
p.m. Feb. 10. The application
must be endorsed by the appli-
cant’s major advisor. A $15 ap-
plication fee is needed. For
freshmen who apply for a soph-
omore exchange year, the fee
will be refunded if he is not ac-
cepted in the program by Da-
vidson.

Financial obligations are ar-
ranged by the home school. Da-
vidson students pay Davidson
fees wherever they go. Charges
for special fees are billed by
the host school at their rates.

Enrollment in ROTC or the
Humanities sequence will not
impede an application. The pro-
gram is extremely flexible and
arrangements can be worked
out.

As of now only two students
from Davidson have applied,
but more are expected as the
Feb. 10 deadline draws near.
Ostwalt, as Exchange Program

Officer, says late applications
can be handled on a special ba-
sis but that it’s not wise to wait’
until later.

There is a danger that some
of the women’s schools involved
will drop the exchange program
if they don’t receive more stu-
dents. The number of women
who come to Davidson is indi-
rectly controlled by the number
of Davidson men the women’s
schools receive.

Ostwalt sees the program as
still at the evaluation stage.
More involvement by Davidson
and the other men’s schools is
needed to make the program a
success.

Ostwalt is quick to point out,
as are the Grey House women
and the exchange students back
at Davidson this year, that for
the individual, the program is
extremely successful.

The deadline for application
(Feb. 10) to the Eight College
Exchange Program is fast ap-
proaching, and members of the
college community are urging
students to consider its advan-
tages.

SGA President Ralph Peeples
convened a Senate ad hoc com-
mittee Monday, and stated its
purpose as “‘to get aS many Co:
eds as possible to come to Da-
vidson next year,” in the event
that coeducation on a_ regular
scale is impossible.

Peeples noted that the most
urgent problem connected with
the Consortium program is the
lack of information on the sub-
ject within the general student
body.

To remedy that situation, the
committee decided on several
courses of action: each member
of the rising Junior Class is be-
ing contacted personally by
some representative of the com-
mittee, presentations are being
delivered at the eating clubs, a
group of coeds is writing a let-
ter to be sent to members of
the rising Sophomore and Junior
Classes, and coeds will also
meet with each of the fresh-
man halls this week.

Director of Instructional De-
velopment Jay Ostwalt explain-
ed how the Consortium was
compatible with the necessity
for students to meet area and
major requirements.

“First of all, students plan-
ning to participate in the pro-
gram should concentrate on
their major requirements in the
sophomore year, and spend the
year away on filling area re-
quirements,” he said.

“Permission can be secured
from the Registrar’s Office to
defer the necessary area re-
quirements until the junior
year for added flexibility.

“Students should talk to pro-
fessors in their major depart-
ment,” Ostwalt continued, ‘‘be-
cause some courses offered at

other schools in the Consortium
will meet their major require-
ments.”’

Ostwalt also mentioned the
possibility of students taking a
heavier load of courses when
they returned to Davidson, if
they were already in some form
of an accelerated program, but
added, “In my opinion, it’s not
one of the better options.”

Dean of Students Will Terry
expressed his approval of the
program and said, “I think it
helps a student to get another
kind of educational viewpoint.
It’s good that we can offer this
opportunity through the Consor-
tium without a lot of additional
hassle.

“It may enable a student to
get course offerings which we
don’t have here,’ he continued,
‘for example, the fine film
courses offered at Hollins.”

President Samuel R. Spencer,
presenting his views of the pro-
gram, commented, ‘First of all,
I would say that it’s not for ev-
erybody, but for many, going
elsewhere for a part of his ed-
ucation will give a student a
kind of perspective that he
wouldn’t have otherwise.”

Clinical Psychologist Wiliam
G. Workman agreed with the
program and said, ‘‘The idea is
good; I’m enthusiastic about
anything that broadens a _ per-
son's experience.”

Consortium Veterans Give
New Program High Rating

By PHILIP BISHOP

Davidson veterans of the Eight
College Exchange Program en-
dorse it enthusiastically, both
during their year away from
Davidson and after they return.

Bill Davenport, a junior now
studying at Hollins College,
praised the completely different
atmosphere he found at a girls’
school. “‘The girls at Hollins
don’t write letters to the editor,
don’t put things on the Wailing
Wall, and don’t worry about
IMAC games. They study hard,
and, then they enjoy them-
Selves,” he said.

‘The Spartan mentality at Da-
vidson makes you do a lot of
things you don’t .need to do. At
Hollins, having fun is just as
important as studying,’”” Daven-
port added. ‘‘There is much less
academic pressure.”

Davenport felt this attitude
was a tremendous advantage of
study at Hollins. “If you don’t
spend a year at a girls’ school,
you don’t know what you're
missing,” he said.

“At Hollins, you can’t date a
girl and then sink back into

your ego-boosting peer group.
You have to face the girls every
day, and you learn to deal with
women on a one-to-one basis,”
said Bobby Allen, a senior who
studied in the Consortium last
year.

Allen: emphasized the oppor-
tunity for new personal rela-
tionships. ‘‘The communal atmo-
sphere at Hollins makes it much
less formal. The exchange stu-
dents can know the professors
on a first name basis.”

Hollins’ January semester is
“an excellent opportunity to
work intensively in your major,
or to break out of it and travel
abroad,’’ added Allen.

Senior Joe Turner praised the
academic benefits of his year
at Hollins. ‘‘It’s a chance to ab-
sorb a different approach to ed-
ucation. You can gain fresh in-
sight and round out your under-
graduate experience.

“So many people complain
about the situation at Davidson.
Study at a girls’ school is a tre-
mendous opportunity to do some-
thing about enriching and ex-
panding your education,” Tur-
ner said.
