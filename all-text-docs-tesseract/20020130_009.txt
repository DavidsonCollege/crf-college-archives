Fair weather and blue skies smiled
on the Davidson Wildcats last weekend,
as the men’s track and field team trav-
eled to UNC-Chapel Hill to compete in
the two-day Blue Heaven Rumble. After
withdrawing from the previous week’s
competition due to dangerous travel in
inclement weather, the Wildcats’ eager-
ness to compete led to several outstand-
ing performances on the track. It was a
strong opening competition for the team,
which competed in a field of over 60
teams from all over the East coast.

The weekend’s standout perfor-
mance belonged to senior co-captain Dan
Gibson. After breaking the outdoor
1,500-meter record last spring, Gibson
opened his indoor season with a stun-
ning record-breaking mile run last Sat-
urday. He crossed the finish line in a
blazing 4:17.38, placing 13th in a field
of 67 and finishing just seven seconds
behind the race-winning time of 4:10.83.
Gibson’s performance improves the old
record, held by recent graduate Brent
Farrell, by more than one second. He is
now the proud holder of four records for
Davidson track and field.

“TI think it was a good start to a long
season, but we certainly have a lot of
work left to do,” said Gibson.

In anear miss, sophomore Greg Scott
came within 1.5 seconds of breaking the
school record in the 800-meter dash. He
crossed the finish line in 1:57.97, a mere
1.2 seconds behind his indoor personal

best of 1:56.79. Scott placed 18th out of

73 runners in the event. Senior Jay Jahnes
was just behind Scott, finishing in a time
of 2:02.69,

Sophomore Ben Gaspar turned in
another impressive distance perfor-

mance. Gaspar placed 23rd in the 3,000-

meter run with a time of 8:54.30, just
under his personal best of 8:54.41 in last
year’s conference meet. In the 5,000-
meter run, sophomore Dave Bunge also
ran well, placing 27th with a time of
16:15.07.

Once again, junior co- captain Greg
Schernecke led the Wildcat sprinters in
the shorter events. Schernecke placed
64th in the 200-meter dash with a time of
23.71, a .08 second improvement over
his strong opening performance last
weekend at Appalachian State. He was
followed by sophomore teammate An-
drew Pratt, who finished with a time of
24.88 for 81st place.

In other sprinting events, John
Leverett finished the 60-meter dash in
7.35 seconds, and Drew Weber finished
the 60-meter hurdles in 9.69 seconds.
Freddie Bowie posted a 55.10 finish in
the 400-meter dash, followed closely by
teammate Johannes Norling with a time
of 55.38.

While strong individual performances
anchored the Wildcats last weekend, the
relay teams struggled against the stiff
competition. The 4x400-meter relay team
placed 24th with a time of 3:37.14, and
the 4x800-meter relay placed 10th with
a time of 8:41.43.

For now, it looks to be a season of

broken records and personal bests for
the men’s track and field team. Up next
for the Wildcats are two weeks of rigor-
ous training before their next competi-
tion. Davidson will return to Chapel Hill
on February 8 forthe Carolina Fast Times
meet on Feb. 8.

After a weeklong delay, the
women’s track and field team opened
their season this weekend at the highly
competitive Blue Heaven Track and
Field Rumble on the brand new Tar
Heel-blue lanes at the University of
North Carolina.

Freshman Sally Stanhope, a cross
country all-conference performer,
started the Wildcats on the right foot
Friday night when she set a new school
record in the 5,000-meter run in a time
of 18:14.22. Stanhope enjoyed running
in such a large and competitive meet,
saying, “It was a really cool environ-
ment for racing because there were so
many people and so many voices.”

In Saturday’s events, several of the
Davidson women posted good early-
season times. Freshmen Anna Brew and
Sarah Baxter competed in the mile, turn-
ing in times of 5:39.83 and 5:53.11,
respectively.

In the 3,000-meter run, sophomore Laura
Puckett ran a smart, confidence-building race.
of 10:56.86, while teammate Emily Einstein
put in a good opening time of 11:27.60.

Juniors Liz Gross, Jana Yee, and Jenny
DiCosmo rounded out the individual running
events for the ‘Cats, while sophomore
Amanda Yeck competed in the triple jump.
Sophomores McKensy Gruelle and Erin
Jacob and freshmen Lindley Swartz and
Genny Hanisek made up the 4x800-meter
relay team.

At the close of the competition, head
coach Jennifer Straub was optimistic about
the start of the season and where the team
is headed, saying, “I am very pleased with
the way the girls opened up this weekend.
It is obvious that their training over the
break has paid off, and I look forward to
seeing further results.”

Now that the "Cats have one meet
behind them, they will continue their in-
door season in Princess Anne, Maryland
this weekend on the track of Maryland
Eastern Shore in the Fighting Hawk Games.

ers ’05 placing first in the 400 and the 800.

Solo male diver Chris Wrobleski se-

sively and won many of their events.

°05 controlled the 400 medley relay,
winning in 4:34.18. In the freestyle
