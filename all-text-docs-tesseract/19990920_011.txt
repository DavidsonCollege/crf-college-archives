_THE DAVIDSONIAN

@ The Student Health Advisors

By ELISABETH SMITH
Health Advisor .

Recently, it was called to my attention that
many people don’t know the all the five Health
Advisors and so I thought I'd take the time to
introduce us to the world. Jenny Hapgood, Seth
Davis, Yolanda

Bill Giduz

this year, Yolanda Kirby, one junior, Jenny
Hapgood, and three sophomore, Julia Philpott,
Seth Davis and me, Elisabeth Smith. Look at the
picture above: Jenny is on the left side of the picture
in the front, Julia is in the dead center, Seth is the
only boy, Yolanda is in the back wearing a hat, and
I’m peaking out between Jenny and Yolanda. We
all participate in
lots of activities

Kirby, Julia
Philpott, and my-
self, Elisabeth

Smith, make up

oncampus sol’ Il
give you some
highlights.

the team commit-
ted to helping any
(and every)
Davidson student
deal with health
issues- alcohol,
drugs, sexuality,
birth control,
STDs, depresston,

“You (may)see us as you want to see us: in
the simplest terms, in the most convenient
definitions. But what we found out is that
each one of us is a brain, and an athlete,
anda basket case, aprincess, anda criminal.
Does that answer your question?

Yolandais one of
the captains of
the track team
and babysits for
almost every
child in the
Davidson area.
Jenny is a Hall
Counselor for
the lucky girls on

eating disorders,
etc. You may be
wondering how
we can help you
or why you should

Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.”

4th Little, works
in the writing
center, and tries
to ride her horse

come to us. Be-
fore becoming
Health Advisors, we all had to apply and inter-
view and were chosen last spring for this year.
During Orientation, we spent many exciting hours
with Georgia (she needs only one name- if you
don’t know who I’m talking about, go to the
Health Center and find out) and received training
in all the health issues I just mentioned. If we
don’t know the answer to one of your questions,
we definitely can find out and trust me, you can
call any of us whenever you want- we want to talk
to you!

Alright introductions....We have one senior

as much as she
; can. Julia is the
president of the Davidson Dance Ensemble (if you
see her standing on her face, don’t be scared) and
wants to be a marriage counselor someday. Seth is
an editor of the Davidsonian and volunteers for the
Ada Jenkins Center. I’m involved with the Rape
Awareness Committee and am the Chair of the
Films Committee for the Union.
And here are some for you to guess: one of us
had open heart surgery as a child, one of has a
webbed toe, one of us is talented with his/ her
tongue, one of us created some of the best Flickerball
cheers ever, and one of us loves falafel.
