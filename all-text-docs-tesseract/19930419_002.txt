Activities Tax Council Proposes $223,500 Budget for '93-'94
Allocations to be Submitted to SGA for Approval

By Chris Frampton

This, week, the A.T.C. ap-
proved a 1993-94 budget with
$223,500 worth of funds to be di-
vided among student run campus
organizations. As a branch of the
SGA, the council must now send
the budget to the Senate for final
approval.

The Activities Tax Council,
according to Chairman Jason
Bertsch, is mandated by the SGA
to “allocate and supervise the use
of student activity fees collected in
the comprehensive tuition bill.”
Funds are received by many SGA
chartered organizations, including
publications, club sports, F.L.A.G.,
and the Environmental Action

Committee.

Comprised of Chairman
Bertsch, Vice-Chairman Rachel
Worlds, College Controller Ed
Cania, Dean of Students Will Terry,
Union. Director William Brown,
and five members of the student
body, the committee met last week
with all groups petitioning for
money from the fund. After each
meeting, the council then debated
the proposed budget and allocated
an amount to be submitted to the
entire SGA.

Budgets allocations ranged
from the $130,000 proposed for
the Union tothe $300 for the Span-
ish Club. The $223,500 total bud-
get is an approximation from the

estimated 1,490 students expected
to attend Davidson next year, each
paying a $150 activities tax.

The fee itself has increased in

_ past years, up $20 from last year’s

$130. Effective for the 1994-95
year, it will be set at one percent of
the total tuition.

Although the entire budget
must be formally approved by the
entire SGA, the process usually
includes little debate, since the
ATC oversees each budget very
carefully. Bertsch noted, “The
ATC hada difficult job in making
decisions about allocations, but I
believe we fulfilled our goals and
purpose in allocating funds in a
prudent and fair manner.”

Honor Council Elects New Officers
Plans Already Being Made for Next Year's Committee

By Alice Felmlee

On Wednesday, April 14th the
Honor Council selected a new
chairman and secretary for the
1993-’94 school year. In a silent
vote Ward Davis, a rising senior,
was elected to replace Matt
Bumstead as chair. Sally Stone,
also a rising senior, was elected
secretary, and will assume
Catherine Milligan’s duties in the
fall.

The Honor Council elections
which took place in Phi Hall began
with positive discussion about each
of the candidates, who at this time

left the room, and concluded with
a silent vote amongst the remain-
ing members of the council.
While all of the thirty mem-
bers of the Honor Coucil are en-
couraged to run for one of these
positions both Davis and Stone
entered the elections with the most
experience. ie
When taking her seat in the
fall, Stone will bring with her many
hopes and plans. She commented,
“T look forward to working with
Ward for a productive and educa-
tional year.”
Current

Chair, Matt

Bumstead, commented when as-
sessing the year, “We have done
more this year to improve the sys-
tem than in any year since I have
been here but there are still many
changes which need to be made.”

Lookirly towards next year he
commented on the need for better
communication between the stu-
dent body and the Honor Council
in additon to better clarity on the
rules governing confidentiality.
“Ward and Sally are the best people
for the job. They will work hard to
accomplish these goals and oth-
ers,” he said.’

ter passing the “initial screening”
process, they were interviewed for
the positionsin February. Approxi-
mately.3,000 men and women from
ninecountries weré notified of their
acceptances by the end of March.

Each is looking forward to the
experience largely because of the
cultural advantages and differences
they will encounter in Japan. “It’s
one thing to know the language,
but without an understanding of
the culture, you’re still at a stand-
still,” Orta said.

“T really want to go off and do
something on my own without be-
ing overwhelmed by responsibili-

ties,” Milligan stated. “The JET
Program really fits in, andit will be
a great cultural experience.”

Both also felt quite confident

after their interview sessions. ©

Through extensive preparationand
tips from friends familiar with Japa-
nese culture, they obtained a more
complete indication of what would
likely be expected of them if ac-
cepted.

Milligan and Orta will be told
in which cities they will be teach-
ing for the two-year program within
the next couple of weeks; they will
begin working in the second half
of July.
