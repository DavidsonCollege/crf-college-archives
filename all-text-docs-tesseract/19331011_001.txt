RHODES SCHOLAR

Six Graduates of Davidson Have
Attended Oxford Previously

An illustrated lecture on Oxford Uni-
versity and the Rhodes Scholarships
will be given in Chambers Auditorium
at 7:30 Monday evening, October 16,
by Dean Wilburt C. Davison, head of
the School of Medicine at Duke Uni-
versity.

Doctor Davison went to Oxford in
1913 as a Rhodes Scholar from the
State of New York. Since the real-
lotment of the Rhodes Scholarships,
according to districts, he has had a
prominent part in administering the
new plan. He has served on state and
district committees of selection from
Richmond td New Orleans. Last year
he served in Virginia and North Caro-
lina and then on the district commit-
tee in Atlanta.

Davidson has had six of its gradu-
ates to enter at Oxford. Wilson Plum-
mer Mills of the class of 1903, Dr.
Benjamin Rice Lacy of the class of
1906, Shelby L. McCoy of the class of
1918, Dr. James McDowell Richards of
the class of 1922, Robert F. Davidson
of the class of 1923, and Dean Rusk
of the class of 1931, have been the
forttinate ones. Rusk is now entering
upon his third year at Oxford. He is
specializing in Economics, Philosophy
and Political Science, and spends his
summers in Germany studying the po-
litical movements there.

In our district (Virginia, North Caro-
lina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Tennessee) each state will appoint two
men on January 2nd or 4th. They will
appear before the district committee in
Atlanta. From the twelve state candi-
dates, four will be appointed Rhodes
Scholars. As all applications must be
in the hands of state committees by
November 18th, it will be necessary
for Davidson College candidates to be
approved by the Rhodes Executive
Committee of the college soon after
the first of November.

At the close of his lecture, Dr. Da-
vison will answer questions about ap-
pointments or studies in Oxford.

Concert Orchestra
Organized by. Pfohl

Makes First Appearance Before
Students in Chapel Friday

Mr. J. C. Pfohl, the director of mu-
sic, announced that the personnel of
the newly-formed concert band has
been selected from among the mem-
bers of the R. O. T. C. and regular
college band. The band expects to
play a concert during the month of
November, The numbers to be ren-
dered in this program will consist of
the highest type of band music. Mr.
Pfohl showed that although most peo-
ple associated bands with football
games and military events, that it is
really only“one of the phases of band
music, and that the concert band is
rapidly coming into prominence in the
musical field. This band will fill the
large gap which exists’ between the
regular band and the symphony or-
chestra. The band has a rather large
group of soloists of outstanding abil-
ity and these men will add greatly to
the variety and interest of the pro-
gram.

The concert orchestra was intro-
duced to Davidson when it played in
chapel Friday, October 6. The or-
chestra, under the direction of Mr.
Pfohl, played the “Migonette Over-
ture” by Baumann, and “Valse” by
Schmidt. Mr. Pfohl stated that the
“orchestra had stirpassed his expecta-
tion so far, although it is still ham-
pered by a lack of some very impor-
tant instruments, some of which are:
oboes, bassoons, alto and bass clari-
nets, string basses, and kettle drums.
Plans are being made.for a program
to be given in the near future which
will be entertaining and interesting.
Mr. Pfohl is confident that the orches-
tra will add a great deal to the mu-
sical life of the campus.

Debate Club
Has Meeting

Many Students Signify Desire to
Go Out for Varsity Team

The Davidson Forensic Council held
its first meeting of the year on Tues-
day, October 3, and organized its ac-
tivities as far as was possible so early
in the season. - The faculty approval
of the prospective debate rivals was
secured, and other matters of impor-
tance were discussed in detail.

President Ed Humphrey hopes to
arrange ten debates away from Da-
vidson, and six debates on the hill:
He hopes to secure debates with: Yale,
at New .Haven, Conn.; Lehigh and
Swarthmore, Pennsylvania; the Uni-
versity of Miami, at Miami, Fla; Cen-
ter College, in Ohio, and others. Se-
curing debates with these is by no
means certain, but twenty letters have
been written to schools in the North,
South and West for that purpose.

The tryouts will be held Tuesday
night, October 31, in Chambers Audi-
torium, unless further notice is given.
The subject has not yet been an-
nounced, but will probably be made
known in a few days.

At the.time of publication 35 men
had signified their desire to go out
for the varsity team. The Council
hopes to arouse the interest and sup-
port of the student body still further,
and to secure enough men to turn
out three teams, with their alternates,
capable of competing with any other
collegiate team.

The officers for the year 1933-34 are
as follows: President, Ed Humphrey;
first vice-president, Jack Williams;
second ‘vice-president, Skip Brown;
secretary, Hugh Hawkins; treasurer,
Rawling Pratt-Thomas; debate man-
ager, Bob Smith.

Dr. Walter Lingle
Makes Annual Tour

Davidson Head Addresses
Alumni,, Church Groups, and
Prep Students

Dr. W. L. Lingle left Saturday morn-
ing, October 7, for a speaking tour
on which he will visit Chattanooga and
Birmingham, returning by way of At-
lanta. ‘

On Sunday he preached at the Sec-
ond Presbyterian Church in Chatta-
nooga. Monday morning he spoke to
the students of McCallie School. At
noon he addressed a group of David-
son alumni and in the evening the
Men’s Club of the Second Presbyte-
rian Church.

In Birmingham on Tuesday he ad-
dressed the Synod of Alabama on

According to Jack Williams, editor-
in-chief of the Quips and Cranks, the
photographer will be in Davidson on
October 16 to take student pictures.
As this will be the photographer's
last visit to Davidson, a drive will be
made to get as many pictures made
as possible at this time. Members of
the Annual staff will personally inter-
view all men who have not as yet had
their pictures made and make appoint-
ments to have them taken at a con-
venient time. It is thought that this
will avoid delay and will be more effi-
cient than the method used hereto-
fore,

Annual Photograper’s Last Visit
Scheduled for October Sixteenth

Only Baseball, Basketball and Track Team Pictures Will Be Taken
When the Photographer Returns in the Spring

The faculty pictures, fall sports, fra-
ternity groups, and all other campus
activities will also be taken at this
time. The photographer will return
in the spring to take the basketball,
baseball and track pictures. However,
no student pictures will be made at
that time.

Owing to the added expense of each
additional trip of the photographer
from Philadelphia, it is hoped that all
remaining student pictures can. be
made on October 16 so that this sec-
tion of the book can be closed.

The pictures are being made this
year by Zamsky Studios of Philadel-
phia.

Sophs Ballot

on Councilman

Brown, Cathey, Dillard, Goslen,
Partridge, and Pittman Nom-
inated for Councilman

Due to the failure of Dick Parker,
Sophomore member of the Student
Council, to return to school at the be-
ginning of the fall session, it has been
necessary for a new member to be
selected by the Sophomore class to
serve in this capacity.

Accordingly, at a recent meeting of
the Student Council, four men were
picked from the rolls of the Sopho-
more class to be presented to the
members of that class for a vote. The
second-year men had the privilege of
nominating from the floor any man
in addition whom they wished to put
up.

Thus, after a meeting of the class,
at which two additional names were
entered, the following six men were
put to the vole of the class: Lamont
Brown, Henry. Cathey, Herman Dil-
lard, J. B. Goslen, John Partridge, and
Paul Pittman.

In the elections from which the re-
ports were available at the time this
paper went to press,yall nominees had
been eliminated but Partridge and
Pittman.

The other Sophomores who repre-
sent their class on the Council at the
present. time are..Harvey Glass. and
Bob Richardson, president of the
Sophomore class,

Smoker Given
by Sophomores

Plans Are Discussed for Annual
Class House Party

Plans were begun for the Sopho-
more house party last Thursday night
when the second-year men held a
smoker in the banquet hall of Cham-
bers Building. Bob Richardson, presi-
dent of the class, presided.

Before discussion was opened on the
house party, two men, Henry Cathey
and J. B. Goslen, were nominated as
additions to the list of Student Coun-
cil nominees formerly selected by the
regular members of the Council. This
election is necessary to fillea vacancy
left by Dick Parker’s withdrawal from
school.

President Richardson then presented
a plan, devised by the committee on
program arrangements. The proposal
was to have the usual two dances, one
on Friday night and one on Saturday
night, but the latter afternoon to have
an open house by all the fraternities,
during which time barbecue will be
served in the fraternity-court.—Consid-
erable discussion was rendered on this

ning, October 19, at 8:00 p. m. in
Chambers Auditorium. The recitals in
this series are to be given on the third
Thursday evening of each month and
it is expected that many persons will
avail themselves of this opportunity to
hear the best in musical-literature.

It is the desire of the Department
of Music, to present to the public sey-
eral series of programs throughout the

Praises ’Cats

Applauds Wildcat Spirit in Pep
Meeting for Wofford Game

A lively and well-attended pep meet-
ing was held in Shearer Hall Friday
night, in preparation for the Wofford
game Saturday, and was featured by
a talk by Professor F. L. Blythe.

The band opened the meeting. by
playing a sprightly tune, after which
several of the best Davidson yells were
given. :

Following this, Head Cheerleader
Hawkins introduced Professor Blythe.
In the course of his speech, Professor
Blythe praised the fighting and “never-

acterized the Davidson football team.
He stated that he has never seen a
Davidson eleven that was not a true
Wildcat team and added that this year,
in his opinion, the team is even
stronger and harder fighting than last
year’s. Professor Blythe ended his
talk by predicting a decisive defeat
over Wofford.

The strains of “O Davidson” fol-
lowed, the rafters shaking with the
vibration thereof. Several more yells
were then given, after which Hawkins
urged that the student body in singing
“O Davidson” at football games would
please insert the name of the Oppos-
ing team instead of singing “every
foe.”

The meeting was closed by Hawkins
asking that the students please be as
quiet as possible Friday night for the
benefit of the players.

“D” Club Plans
Big Welcoming

Student Co-operation Asked in
Giving Rival Teams Cordial
Reception

The “D"-Club is planning to take
care of the visiting athletic teams on
the campus this year in order that the
visitors will be made to feel at home
on the Davidson grounds. The organ-
ization, ably led this year by the pres-
ident, Mac Holland, and backed up
by Captain Norton G. Pritchett, hopes
to entertain the athletes from other
schools by the use of ‘the fraternity
houses, and by allowing the visitors
to go to the Davidson Theater free of
charge.

In order to carry out the plans it
is necessary to have the co-operation
of the student body. It has been sug-
gested that a button be placed on the
visitors so that they may be recog-
nized by the students and taken care
of, “This experiment will go into ef-
fect when the V. M. I. football squad

of the State Fall Council held in Char-
jlotte. A representation from ten col-
|leges over the section gathered to con-
sider filling the vacancy that will result
upon the resignation of Florence Mof-
\fett, president. The latter action be-
lcame necessary when Miss Moffett
found that she could no longer mect
the demands of the position as presi-
dent and‘maintain her previous work
in Queens-Chicora, where she is a stu-
dent. However, she has consented to
remain in office.until the last of the
Fall Institutes, at which time Francis
Scott will continue the work in her
stead.

The colleges represented were Appa-
lachian State Normal, Asheville Nor-
mal, Catawba, Davenport, Davidson,
Duke, Johnson C. Smith, Flora Mac-
donald, Guilford, and Greensboro Col-
|lege. Definite plans for the Fall In-
listitutes were drawn up. They will be
held in Asheville, November 4 and 5;
in Charlotte, November 6 and 7; in
Greensboro, November 8 and 9; and in
Raleigh, November 11 and 12. This
jis being done in order to centralize
the effort expended within these sec-
jtions to bring to the attention of
churches and other colleges the cause

| Contrary to popular opinion, the
Student Volunteer Movement is not
composed solely of those Christian

cludes all students in the colleges of
America whose interest in missions is
that of the investigator and supporter.

day Smoker

Blazers and privileges were the
items discussed at the Senior smoker
last Tuesday night in the Chambers
reception room,

The fourth-year men decided to ob-
tain navy blue coats with white in-
signia, and in two-buttton style. Three
men, President Fred Smyre, W. A:
Kirkland, and A. H. Manson, were
appointed on a committee to investi-
gate prices and to select a tailor.

Only two privileges were proposed
by the Seniors for presentation be-
fore the faculty for its consideration.
“Six excused absences for every
fourth-year man each semester in
each subject, and the right to keep
cars on the campus after the Easter
kolidays is all we want,” the Seniors

unanimously exclaimed.

Pan-Hellenic
Council Plans
For Homecoming

Nick Laney’s Orchestra to Fur-
nish Music for Social —

Events
HARRIERS TO RUN
Tickets to Go On Sale This
Week

Homecoming, always a red-letter day
in the history of Davidson, will be
celebrated on the week-end of October
21, and will be featured by the Duke-
Davidson football game and two
dances sponsored by the Pan-Hellenic
Council,

The first dance will be a formal af-
fair, held on Friday night, October
20, to be followed by an informal
dance on Saturday night. Nick Laney,
who recently completed a most suc-
cessful engagement at the Mayview
Manor in Blowing Rock, will furnish
the music for both occasions. Within
the past six months, Laney and _ his
orchestra, composed of Duke students,
have also played engagements at Char-
lotte and Greensboro, and their music
has been enjoyed by many people
throughout the state.

The Pan-Hellenic. Council has an-
nounced that tickets for the dances
may be secured this week from any
member of that body. Tickets for the
set will be three dollars, but taken in-
dividually, the price for the Friday
night dance will be two dollars, and
the admission Saturday night, one dol-
lar and a half. The Friday night
dance will be from 10 until 2; the
dance Saturday night from 8:30 to 12,

A number of girls will be here on
bids of the social fraternities, all of
which are having house parties for
the occasion. Also, many Duke stu-
dents attending the game are expected
for the dances.

The Duke-Davidson contest has al-
ways been a big attraction to both
Blue Devil and Wildcat supporters
alike, and the game is expected to
draw a capacity crowd. Another fea-
ture of Homecoming Day will be a
cross-country meet in which the Da-
vidson varsity and freshman runners
will encounter the teams from Duke.

Interest Increases

in Y.M.C. A. Work

First Freshman Feed Is Held in
the Social Center

Increased interest in the student ac-
tivities of Davidson College Y. M. C.
A. has been evident in the work of
the past week. A series of feeds for
the freshmen have been planned, and
deputation work to nearby points has
begun in earnest.

The first of the freshman feeds was
held in the Social Center last Tuesday
night at 9 o'clock, with about twenty-
five new men and a number of upper-
classmen present. Billy Northen, Geddy
Monroe and David McLean enter-
tained the freshmen with several songs,
These three musicians are known as
the Pills Brothers. After the music,
an informal feed was enjoyed. Sim-
ilar parties will be held at the Social
Center each Tuesday night at 9
o'clock. Invitations to the freshmen
are mailed weekly.

Y. M. C. A. deputations last week
included one to Banner Elk, one to
North Wilkesboro, two to Statesville,
and one to Cornelius,

The Banner Elk deputation included
Rufus Morrow, Duck Powell, Sam
Nickey, Ellis Oakes, and Moreland
Cunningham, All of these taught Sun-
day School classes in Banner Elk, and
Rufus Morrow conducted the regular
morning worship service in the Ban-
ner Elk Presbyterian Church on Sun-
day, October 8. Religious services at
outpost churches near Banner Elk
were conducted by this deputation on
Sunday afternoon. Duck Powell spoke
at-vespers in the Banner Elk Church
in the evening, and an important fea-
ture of all the services was the music
of Moreland Cunningham, who played
the trumpet.

Sam Wiley, secretary of the David-
son College Y. M. C. A,, led a num-
ber of services in North Wilkesboro
and other towns in Ashe County last
Sunday. Sunday night he preached
the initial service of a new church in
Laurel Falls.
