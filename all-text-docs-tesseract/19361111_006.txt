©1936, LIGOETT & MYERS TQBACCO CO,

Like fine wines, Chesterfield
tobaccos are aged for two
years or more to make them
mellow and better-tasting.

There is no higher standard
of tobacco quality than the
Chesterfield standard.

Few things that grow require all
tHe care and cultivation it takes
to raise the mild, ripe tobaccos
in Chesterfield Cigarettes.

Proper curing by the farmer
gives flavor to Chesterfield
tobaccos just as it does to
fine hams and bacon.
