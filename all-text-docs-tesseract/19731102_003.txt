Davidsonian To Make
Few Printing Changes

By MICHAEL TANNER
Executive Editor

The sale of the Davidson
Printing Company which
presently prints THE DAVID-
SONIAN to Banner Publishers
should not in any way affect the
publication of THE DAVID-
SONIAN according to Editor-in
Chief Alec Hoon.

“This issue will be the last
one published under the owner-
ship of Taylor Blackwell, who
turned over the operation
of his printing company to the
South Carolina publishers on
Thursday.

“Beginning next week, Ban-
ner Publishers will handle all
stages of the printing operation,
from setting the stories to ac-
tually printing the paper,”’
Hoon said.

When contacted about any
changes in THE DAVID-
SONIAN operation, President
of Banner Publishers Fred
Sheheen said, ‘‘For the present
there will be only several minor
changes. One of these will be
that the actual printing of the
paper will be done at our plant
in South Carolina, rather than
in Mooresville as it is done now.

“I would emphasize that this
will mean little or no change in
the deadlines, and that the
paper will continue to be
distributed on Thursday
nights,’’ Sheheen said.

One other change that

announced was that
the width of the columns would
change from 10.5 ems to 10.0
ems, which to the laymen
means that the columns will be
about 1/12 of an inch narrower.

This reduction in the width of
a column will not be as difficult
a transition as it would appear.
The only difference is that there
will be slightly less words per
column inch.

‘“‘We had to make a change
from an 11 em line to a 10% em
line when we went to offset prin-

ting last year. We had no
problem then, and so I an-
ticipate no difficulties now,”
Hoon explained.

He stated that one positive
benefit of the new operation
might well be that the printed
pictures would have better
resolution.

“THE DAVIDSONIANstaffs
have always had a very good
relationship with Blackwell
and his employees. Everyone
seemed more than anxious to
assist the staff in producing
the best paper possible.

‘‘Blackwell himself was
always especially willing to
help. Everyone involved with
THE DAVIDSONIAN has
always been very appreciative
of that,’”’ Hoon said.

“‘We fully expect to have as
geod a relationship with the
Banner personnel, '’ Hoon con-
cluded.

“I anticipate a smooth tran-
sition period for everyone in-
volved. The personnel working

What academic service at
Davidson offers courses at nine
other colleges, conducts
workshops with nationally
known writers, is free to stu-
dents and costs only $100 per
year tothe college? You guessed
it - the Charlotte Area Educa-
tional Consortium.

The organization is spon-
sored by 10 local colleges and
universities and is designed to
provide students, faculty, and
administration officials of the
member institutions a channel
for cooperation on educational
projects.

A major service provided
students by the consortium is

pany will basically remain the
same, except that a new editor
for The Mecklenburg Gazette
will be brought in,”’ Hoon said.

“I think that any problems we
face will be minor, and that the
staff has reached a point of
competency where they can
handle any difficulties,’’ he ad-
ded

This change in the location of
the actual printing operation
will work to everyone’s benefit.

The Mooresville Tribune,
which previously did the prin-
ting, is releived that THE
DAVIDSONIAN can now be
printed in South Carolina as

ting enough newsprint. Even
without THE DAVIDSONIAN,
they are overloaded with
newspapers.

“‘We are sort of sorry to leave
Mooresville, because they did
such a good job in printing our
paper. However, we fully ex-
pect to get the same high-

quality printing with Banner
Publications,’’ Hoon said.

unique to particular schools.
This service constitutes the
“central opportunity” of the
consortium for students, ac-
cording to Exchange Officer

Jay H. Ostwalt, the
organization’s representative
at Davidson.

Davidson records the grades
from such courses on the same
basis as all other transfer
credit, said Ostwalt.

Some of the major ac-
complishments of the -con-
sortium include common listing
of all science equipment
available on the several cam-
puses, common listings of the
schools’ periodical holdings,
sharing and exchanging of
professors, a study of com-
puters in education, and a

Davidson Plant Maintained
By Loyal College Employees

The white frame building bet-
ween Cannon dormitory and the
laundry bears only one sign,
“Shipping and Receiving’’.

Yet this insignificant building
is the headquarters for a large
group of Davidson employees
who keep the college’s physical
plant in order. These people
work in one of several depart-
ments: the shop, shipping and.
receiving, | groundskeeping,
custodial and utility. J

Under the control of the
Physical Plant Department, the
shop has the difficult task of
repairing damage done to all
college buildings.“ The

make any piece of equipment
needed by an office or depart-
ment.

Luther Honeycutt is in charge
of the Shop. He stated that their
biggest problem has been
damage done to the dorms by
students. ‘Several things go
against the grain, like when
students get mad and kick their
doors. That knocks the plaster
~ out and we have to fix it,”’
Honeycutt said.

He\added that many of the
repairs of that type have to wait
until the summer. ‘“‘By then
there is so much to do in some of
the dormitories that we can har-
dly do it all,’ Honeycutt said.

In addition to working on
school property, the shop is
responsible for the upkeep of the

The Shipping and Receiving
department works with the
shop. They handle all the ship-
ments that come in for use by
the school. They operate on the
ground floor of the building.

The Grounds Department is
also headquartered there.
Headed by Irvin Brawley, these
men cut the grass, prune the
trees, landscape, and help with
planning for such things as
drainage and development.

Now they are busy coping
with the leaves. They operate
the snow removal machines if

and when it snows.

There are several other
departments that serve im-
portant functions. The custodial
employees , under the leader-
ship of Junior Barker, perform
the thankless tasks of cleaning
planning for such things as
mess and after water fights,
etc.

The Utility Department is one
of the least heralded, but most
needed segments of the
Physical Plant. These em-
ployees keep the steam and
water pumps and pipes in or-
der. They also maintain the
heat, air conditioning, plum-
bing, purchase of fuels, lighting
outside, and electrical tran-
sformers.

Equipment such as audio-
visual machines fall under their
jurisdiction. Philip Cashion is
the man in command of this
operation.

Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze is
pleased with the caliber of work
that is done by these depart-
ments. ‘The men in the various
departments do an excellent
job. There may besome things
that don’t get done right away,
but they do the best they can.”’

job requests are never fulfilled,

Although owner Taylor Blackwell has turned over the ownership
of the Davidson Printing Company to Banner Publishers of South
Carolina, the printing process of THE DAVIDSONIAN will not be
affected. Pictured above are the typists.

Consortium Offers Diversity For Students

‘Readers and Writers Con-
ference’’ held each of the past
four years.

Particularly successful has
been the ‘‘Readers and Writers
Conference’’, which consists of
workshops at which students
submit manuscripts for ap-
praisal by professional writers.
Daphne Athas, author of the ac-
claimed novel ‘‘Entering
Ephesus,’’ was one of the last
year’s guest writers.

“The important thing (in the
workshops) is the close scrutiny
the manuscripts receive,’’ said
Professor of English James S.
Purcell.

‘‘The conference deserv
more consideration from
Davidson students,”’ Purcell ad-
ded, noting that the number of
participating students from

re averages around five or
six. Purcell is a member of the
English Professors Consortium,
an association sponsored by the
CAEC.

Ostwalt also explained that
the consortium can assist in
bringing together students who
share common interests or
responsibilities, such as
newspaper editors or student
government officials.

The consortium § differs

markedly from such
organizations in other areas by
virtue of its loose structure.
Major policy decisions are
made by a council composed of
two members from each school
which meets four times a year.

The council has considered
adopting a more heavily struc-
turea organization but rejected
the idea because of excessive
‘cost. The rejected plan would
cost $30,000 or more, as
compared to the present budget
of only $1000.

The consortium‘s pians for
the future include an expansion
into the area of ‘‘experiential
learning,’’ which Ostwalt
defined as ‘‘any kind of learning
situation involving on-the-job
experience.’’ As examples he
cited work with government
agencies, social work, and jobs
in hospitals.

The nine other institutions in
the consortium are Barber-
Scotia College, Belmont Abbey
College, Central Piedmont
Community College, Gaston
College, Johnson C. Smith
University, Queens College,
Sacred Heart Collge, UNC-C
and Wingate College.

... Pre-Med Program

(Continued from page 1)

The trouble with some
medicine-related fields is that
the Davidson graduate is
“overeducated before he
starts,”’ said Fredericksen.

‘“‘When you get to a certain
level in education, you can go

parallel but not down,”’
Fredericksen explained. He
pointed out that few Davidson
graduates would want to
become paramedics.

Fredericksen is convinced of
the quality of the Davidson pre-
medical student. He said he was
weary of. the pre-med being
“sterotyped’”’ as someone who
spends all his time in the
library.

“I don’t mind a bit recom-
mending 95 percent of the
students around here,’
Fredericksen added with a
wave of his hand.

“‘What tears me up is the boys
who are qualified and still don’t
get into med school,”’ he said.

Fredericksen believes the
pressure for admission to the
nation’s medical schools will
ease soon.

“The pressure cooker is as
high as it can go,"’ said
Fredericksen

, “and the pop
valve has to let loose soon.”
