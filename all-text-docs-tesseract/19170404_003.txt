held by Nesbit. Bullock, C. W. Worth,
Foscue and T. C. Stone, while the
negative was represented by J. K. Flem-
ing, McDonald, Roberts and Boney.

The debate as a whole was not up to
the standard, due to lack of preparation
and the Lyceum attraction. which’ im-
mediately followed the meeting.

On Monday morning Reese gave an
oration on “Moving Pictures as an Aid
in the School House;’ Webber on
“Sparticus to the Alligators; Mann on
“Capital Punishment ;” Finley on “Re-
forms Needed in the Examination Sys-
tem,” and R. H. Stone on “State Char-
acteristics.” Declamations were given
by Hart and Lacy.

In the Eumenean Society Saturday
night the subject of “Home Rule for
Ireland” was discussed. ‘The affirma-
tive was upheld by Liston, Patterson,
Jenkins and Flinn. ‘The negative was
defended by Morton, McCloy, Frier-
son and Brown, The affirmative based
their argument on the desire of Ireland
for Home Rule, and contended — this
would be the only way to bring peace to
the unsettled island. “he negative con-
tended that it would be unjust to Ulster,
and that it would disturb England's
political relations. ‘The decision was in
favor of the negative.

Monday morning the following ofh-
cers were elected for the first term next
year: President, R. W. Cousar; Vice-
President, Emery Flinn; Secretary, Wil-
liam Love; Treasurer, J. B. Woods;

Council, A. S. Potts and E. A. Woods.

DAVIDSON ‘TO HAVE
CLEAN-UP DAY TUESDAY

Tuesday, April roth, has been desig-
nated as spring cleaning day by the
Town Council.

All refuse that cannot be burned, if
placed in boxes or barrels at the edge of
the street, will be carried away without
charge. It is earnestly hoped that back
yards, barn yards, outhouses and alleys
will be gone over thoroly on Saturday
and Monday.

Drain all marshy places and see if the
guttering retains any water. Mosquitoes
breed in stagnant water and in stag-
nant water only. No standing water,
no mosquitoes.

If stables are kept clean there will be
no flies and no typhoid in Davidson.

Our death rate in 1914 was 23 to
1,200 people. In 1916 it was 12, with
some increase in population. Efforts to
have more sanitary premises have paid.
More effort will pay more.

Cut weeds. Plant flowers. Remove
unsightly fences. Lime is cheap—and
a purifier.

DAVIDSON DEFEATS ELON
IN EXCITING GAME

Davidson defeated Elon at Elon
Monday by a score of 9-7. The game
was a little loosely played. but exciting.
The playing field was in bad condition
and slowed up the playing considerably.
The feature of the game was Zeb Mc-
Millan's home run over the right field
fence with the bases clogged. Withers,
for Davidson, pitched nice ball and was
strong in the pinches. Line-up:

BOB BURDETTE’S ADVICE.

Young man, get away trom the crowd
awhile and think. Stand on one side
and let the world run by while you get
acquainted with yourself, and see what
kind of a fellow you are. Ask yourself
hard questions about sourself. Ascertain
from original sources if you are really
the manner of man you say vou are; and
if you are always honest; if you are al-
ways square, perfectly true in’ business
details; if your life is as good and up-
right at a1 o'clock at night as it is at
noon; if you are as good a temperance
min ona fishing excursion as vou are on
a Sunday school picnic; if you are as
good when you go to the city as you are
at home. if, in short, vou are really the
sort of a nan your father hopes vou are,
and your sweetheart believes you are.
Get on intimate terms with yourself, my
boy, and believe me, every time you come
out of one of those private interviews,
vou will be a stronger and purer man.
Don't forget this. and it will do you
gond.—The Knights of Pythias.

JILTED.

A lady's hand a man doth ccccc,
His fiery heart doth blaaaaaa ;

He crouches near her on his neeececec
And poured forth her praaaaa.

He woos her with a seeming cececee,

Says she: “Go ‘way, vou little ttttt,
You can’t fool me; I’m yyyy.”

Work in every hour, paid
see only that thou work, and
nat escape the reward. Whether thy
work be fine or coarse, planting corn
or writing epics, so only it be honest
work done to thine own approbation, it
shall earn a reward to the senses as
well as to the thought; no matter how
often defeated, you are born to victory.
The reward of a thing well done is to
have done it.—Emerson.

A weak mind is like a  microscdpe,
which magnifies trifling things, but can-
not receive great ones.—Chesterfield.

DR. OSBORNE SPEAKS
TO THE Y.M.C.A.

At the Y. M. C. A. meeting on last
Thursday night, Rev. F. M. Osborne,
D.D.. of Charlotte, spoke upon the text
Luke 10:27: “Thou shalt love the
Lord, thy God, with all thy heart, with
all thy soul, with all thy strength, and
with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as
thyself.”

The text was carefully expounded. It
was explained to mean that this was the
first and great commandment and that
every Christian should strive to reach
this ideal toward his Maker.

This love can be shown in different
ways. Each persons has some talent,
and he must do his utmost to use it in
the most effective way to show his love.
Everyone has the right to love God in
what he thinks is the best way:

Loving with all the heart is the emo-
tional love that is an essential part of re-
ligion. Loving with the soul is the high-
est. spiritual love. Loving with the
strength is with the entire being and
personality, while loving with the mind
is the calm judgment that comes after
careful consideration.

Loving one’s neighbor is a natural
consequence of loving one’s God. Tf the
first is done sincerely and truthfully, the
cecond will follow.

ACCOUNT OF ORCHESTRA
AND GLEF CLUB TRIP

The Davidson College Orchestra and
Glee Club left’ Davidson, Monday morn-
ing. March 26th, for its first spring trip.
Entertainment was provided for the boys
at different homes in the town at Lenoir,
the first stop. ‘The concert that night at
the opera house was well attended, and
very successful. The night was spent
in Lenoir.

Leaving the next morning about 7
o'clock, Asheville was reached at 4
o'clock: A very nice dinner of fried
chicken had been provided on the train.
From the station the Orchestra and Glee
Club proceeded at once to the Y. M. C
A. building, where a concert was yiven
toa fair sized audience composed mainly
of young people.

Entertainment had been provided at
Normal College, and after supper at the
college, a concert was piven to the entire
student body, whe proved to be a very
enthusiastic audience. After the concert
the Juniors and ‘Seniors gave a reception
to the club. ‘The next: morning, after
breakfast, a short entertainment | wa
given the children of the ‘Trainine
School. Dinner was caten at the col-
lege. after which they left for Marion.

Many evidences of the recent flood in
that section were seen, and the train was
delayed an hour and a half because a
bridge, which had been washed away,
had to be replaced. Marion was finally
reached, the boys going at once to the
different homes provided for their en-
tertainment. The concert that night
was scheduled for 8:30, but some delay
was caused on account of a missing fuse.

‘The best concert on the whole trip was

given at this time, tho it was not so well
attended.

The night was spent in Marion, the
train leaving for Davidson early Thurs-
day morning. Between Statesville and
Davidson, on the “last lap” of the trip,
the five new members of the Orchestra
and Glee Club were brought inte the
organization with fitting ceremonies.

A stranger entered a church during
the sermon. Getting tired, he asked his
neighbor, “How long has he been
preaching?”

“About thirty or
think.” replied the man.

“T'll stay, then,” said the stranger;
‘the must be nearly done.”—The Young
Man and Woman.

THE TOWN OF DON’T-YOU-
WORRY.
There's a town called Don’t-You-
Worry,

On the banks of River Smile,
Where the Cheer-up and Be-Happy
Blossom sweetly all the while.
Where the Never-Grumble flower
Blooms beside the fragrant Try,
And the Ne’er-Give-Up and Patience
Point their faces to the sky.

In the valley of Contentment,
In the province of I-Will,
You will tind this lovely city,
At the foot of No-Fret hill.
‘There are thoroughfares delightful
In this very charming town;
And on every hand are shade trees
Named the Very-Seldom-Frown.

Rustic benches, quite enticing,

You'll find scattered here.and there ;
And to cach a vine is clinging

Called the Frequent-Earnest- Prayer.
Everybody there is happy,

And is singing all the while,
In the town of Don't-You-Worry,

On the banks of River Smile.

—Keyv. J. 1. Bartlett, D.D.

A recent issue of the Christian En-
deavor World contained the following
clipping, which will interest all David-
son men, because Dr. Price is the father
of P. B. Price, 17, of Davidson:

“Dr. P. Frank Price, the editorial
secretary of the China Christian En-
deavor Union, has done splendid work
this year in the preparation of a Chinese
‘Endeavorer's Daily Companion.’ ‘This
follows the lines of the American ‘Com-
panion, but all of it is adapted to Chi-
nese needs. Dr. Price has supplied for
each Sunday a study of the Bible pas-
sage, as well as illustrations and com-
ments suited to Chinese Christians. For
example, there are many _ illustrations
from Confucius and other Chinese sages.
Dr. Price has alsu written a series of
brief comments on the Junior Christian
Endeavor topics.”

He had opened up a fish market and
he ordered a new sign painted of which
he was very proud. It read: “Fresh
Kish For Sale Here.”

“What did you put the word ‘fresh’
in for?” said his first customer. “You
wouldn't sell them if they weren’t fresh,
would you?”

He painted out the word, leaving just
“Kish For Sale Here.”

“Why do you say ‘here?’ asked his
second customer. You're not selling
them anywhere else are you?”

Su he rubbed out the word “here.”

“Why use ‘for sale?’ ”’ asked the next
custumer. ‘You wouldn't have _ fish
here unless they were for sale, would
you?”

So he rubbed out everything but the
word “Fish,” remarking:

“Well, nobody can find fault with
that sign now, anyway.”

A moment later another
came in.

“IT don’t see what’s the use in having
that sign ‘Fish’ up there,’ said he,
“when you can smell them a block
away.” .

And that’s why the fish market has
no sign.—Ex.
