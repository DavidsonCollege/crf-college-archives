Shaw Smith Set
For Magical Role

By MIKE

A light editorial in the Greens-
boro Daily News this week poked
fun at the high-sounding title of
Davidson's newest addition to the
staff. “Just what, pray. tell, does
a co-ordinator of student activities

edo? But the one at Davidson, we
understand, is also a magician . .
which might be a better name for
the ,job.” After talking to Mr.
Shaw Smith I wonder if the task
cut out for him isn’t one big enough
to make even Blackstone shrink.

He told me he wants the stu-
dents to think of him not as a di-
rector, but as an advisor. He is
the middle man, so to speak, that
is often necessary between stu-
dents and administration.

To me it seems to boil down

MYERS

to this: a guy has a problem—
maybe financial, maybe at the heart,
maybe a gripe about the college—
that he wouldn’r feel quite at éase
presenting to a faculty member.
Shaw's the man for the trouble, no
matter how trivial it may seem,

-| for once his office door is closed

you are in his strictest confidence.

He hastened to poist out the
fact that he was not replacing any-
one on the faculty, for if the matter
can't be adequately solved by him,
he will advise you where to take
it. Also note that he has no dis-
ciplinary authority. He is not even
honor bound to report student vio-
lations, as are the faculty.

He would like to teach English

President Greets Alumni

The Davidsonian is gracious in

allowing me space for a word of

affectionate greeting to you gentlemen—our alumni—at this Home-
coming season. Surely you need fo word from me, as happy as I
am to say it, to understand how heartily your Alma Mater receives

you upon every return to this familiar spot.

In this repository of

friendship and sacred associations there is already a spirit which you

must feel as you come and go.

These are strange and critical days in the fife of our nation. David-
son seeks now, as ever, to make her substantial contribution to the
life of the Church and the State. This we shall continue to do, sup-
ported by your confidence and aid in the years ahead.

May there be for each of you, as you return today, something of

healing and warmth in the associations :

which await you here. Be as-

sured that your presence is a joy and a reassurance to those of us
who labor in the College. We feel the impact of your interest and
your good will and your helpfulness every passing week.

Very Cordially,
J. R. CUNNINGHAM.

Union Dedicated Tomorrow

David Ovens Gave His
Fortune To Aid Others As Holiday Begins

Mr. David Ovens, who made
possible the student union which is
to be dedicated tomorrow through
his gift of $100,000 to Davidson, is
a man who has given away his for-
tune.

Within three months of the time
he made his gift to Davidson, he
gave away a total of $580,000 to

Queens, Duke, Presbyterian Hos-}and Davidson, which are sending

pital Nurses’ Home, Edgar Tufts
Memorial Association, Toccoa Falls
Institute, and Davidson,

In making these gifts Mr. Ovens
said at that time:

“It is my belief that the hope
of the future fies in the Church-
endowed colleges such as Queens

the man who made the Davidson College Union a possibility, is
expected to be on the campus for the dedication ceremonies,

Davidson, having given to each large sums in the past few years.
A number of his friends bave prepared a booklet on his life entitled,

“He Gave His Fortune Away.”

out all over the country young
men and women with that fine
type of religious, cultural, and in-
tellectual training found in these
institutions.”

Ontario, Canada, came to Char-
lotte in 1905. There he has long
been one of the civic and com-
munity leaders, as well as co-
founder of the J. B. Ivey Company
which now operates as a leading
department store in five cities.

ference room with its twelve foot

Spirit Seen High

Spirit among the students just
prior to the biggest fall celebration
of the season is high by alf the
usual indicators of that intangible

quality.

After Davidson's defeat of Pres-
byterian last Friday night, hope
of a second. victory for the Wikd-
cats has been running rampant.
Coach Dole has been priming his
gridders all week for one of the
hardest games of the year when
they meet Furman.

URGES SUPPORT

Head Cheerleader Howard
Proctor says the cheerleaders are
going all out to give their stellar
performance of the year in boost-
ing the cheers for Saturday's strug-
gle.

Proctor urged the same support
of the team that has been shown
at all the games this year and
promises new cheers, surprises, and
several added attractions before and
during the game.

PELIX REAPPEARS

Familiar to most all the alumni
but not so to more recent grad-
uates and present students, will be

the reappearance of Felix. Felix
was the name given to the wildcat
mascot the students in former days
kept for moral boosting purposes.
A grand entrance is planned for
the honored guest of the befuzzed
kingdom. -

GIRL CHEERLEADERS?

There had been some rumors of
gitl cheerleaders, but this has not
panned out. The usual bevy of
beauties for the dances, ballgame,

and parties will be on hand, how-
ever, and the one day holiday will
be put to good use.’

Old Gym Changes

Role, Retains
Founders’ Ideal

When the “Okt Gym” officially
becomes the David Ovens College
Union at dedication services to-
morrow morning, it will mark the
end, in a sense, of an_ historic
building on the Davidson campus.

The old gym was begun in 1914
and completed in 1917 at a cost
of $100,000. Funds for the erec-
tion of the building were donated
and collected by a group of indus-
trious alumni. After the gym was
completed a plaque was placed
there dedicated to those members
of Davidson graduatini: classes
from 1858 to 1918 who contributed
to the gym’s building.

At the time of its completion the
gym was considered by man to be
one of the finest jobs in the South.
Its facilities included the coaches’
offices, a student lounge, and, of
course, a basketball court. This
plant for over 25 years served
thousands of Davidson men.

With the passage of time, how-
ever, and the increase in the size
of the student body, it became
increasingly evident that there was
a pressing need for a larger physi-
cal education establishment.

Several years ago the new John-
ston gymnasium was planned, and
in the due course of events the
corner stone was laid and the
building completed, being dedicated
at Homecoming, 1949.

With the completion of Johnston
Gymnasium the old gym fell into
a short period of disuse. But when
in the fall of 1950, Mr. David
Oven contributed $100,000 to Da.
vidson College for the purpose of
converting it into a modern student
union, it became apparent that the

Dedication Marks High Point
In Development Program

By MOODY SMITH

Dedication ceremonies for

the new David Ovens Student

Union will begin tomorrow morning at I! in front of the

building.

On hand will be Mr.
Ovens of Charlotte whose gift of
$100,000 to Davidson Cotlege fi-
nanced the conversion of the old

gym into its present form.

The principal dedicstion
speech will be delivered by
President John R. Cunningham
who has been instrumental in
guiding the development pro-
gram that has resulted in the
erection of several new build-
ings on the Davidson campus
within the past few years.

The student union 1s a complete-
ly new structure with the exception
of the outside walls and roof which
housed the old gymnasium. Inside
there are three floors: the first,
which was the basement of the
old gym; the second or main floor
at which the main entrance opens;
and the third.

The first floor will include a
cafeteria, dining room for 60 peo-
ple, recreation room with ping-
pong and pool tables, provisions
for a bowling alley and workshop,
and a patio.

On the second floor there will
be a student ‘store, TV room, powder
room, ball room, and the office
of the student union director, Mr.
Shaw Smith.

Several conference rooms, of-
fices for all the student publica-
tions, and a faculty room will be
located on the third floor.

In addition there will be an ele-
vator, and a mail drop, but no
P. O. boxes, All lighting will be

indirect or fluorescent.

The student union will be
open to inspection by alumai,
visitors, and students through-
out the Homecoming weekend,
but will be closed Monday and
until it is ready for actual use.

Mr. W. E. Swain, who super-
vised the construction of the li-
brary, science building, Johnston
Gymnasium, and the new church,
was the superintendent of this con-
struction job also. When he began
working with the Davidson de-
velopment program, Mr. Swain
was living in Charlotte, but when
one project came on the heels of
another, he found it necessary to
move to Davidson.

pus here to join in Homecoming
