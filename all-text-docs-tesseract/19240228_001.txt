at the “Y" service last Sunday afternoon.
His address was impressive, forceful and
a fitting the

by King. This in
which he impressed the need of combin-

of service, was preceded by a song serv-
ice led by C. FL Monk. The seripture,
Acts 03-16, was read by EE. M. Regen and
followed by by Arnett Gamble,
a student from Columbia Seminary,
With the question, “What is the rela-
