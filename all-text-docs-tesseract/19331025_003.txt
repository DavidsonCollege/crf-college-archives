Featuring a beautiful selection of

Professor Bailey regretted exceedingly
their inability to participate. In this
skit, the part “Maudy Clemson”
Was played by Julia Hobbs; “Clem-

Rozy Rozelle.

One of the most appreciated parts
of the show was a clever contrasting
skit portrayed by Elizabeth Rhett and
Blanche Knox, Miss Rhett took the
part of the Flapper of 1933; Miss Knox
was the Belle of 1750.

The Womanless Fashion Show was
a hilarious gem in which Davidson stu-
dents, attired in the latest gowns, dem-
onstrated, with the utmost poise and
grace, the newest modes. The pul-
chritudinous gentlemen were Ed Gar-
rette, Carl Chapman, Blanton Little,
Baxter Moore, Rufus Sanford and Max
Williams.

The Cirele men of the Minstrel were

I keep coming back
to that word “balanced”
on the back of the
Chesterfield package

OU often hear the word balance —
something is out of balance — top-
heavy, not on an “even keel.”

What you read, “Chesterfield Cigarettes
are a balanced blend,” means that the right
amounts of the right kinds of tobacco are
welded together; that is, home-grown to-
baccos, the right kind, the right quantity—
are blended and cross-blended with tobac-
cos from Turkey and Greece.

When these tobaccos are balanced one
against the other, then you have a mild

When they are in balance, then you have
a better-tasting cigarette.

May we ask you to read again the statement
on the back of the Chesterfield package?

May we ask you to try Chesterfield?
