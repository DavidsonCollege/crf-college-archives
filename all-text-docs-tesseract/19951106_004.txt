Let them eat five times a week

Answering student demands, the Commons will offer all upperclassmen the five meal plan

By BiL_y RosBerts

Previous to the spring 1996
semester, the five meal plan at The
Commons has been available only
to residents of Martin Court and
off-campus students. For the up-
coming semester, all upper class
students may opt for the five meal
plan.

Freshmen, however, are still
required to register for either the 19-
or14-meal plans.

Eight months ago, when Ri-
chard Terry became the Director
of Auxiliary Services, he felt he
“needed a better sense of what was
happening,” in terms of the Auxil-

—

iary Services as a whole, before
changes were instituted.

Because of this administra-
tive change and the time needed to
learn all he needed to know, no
new options were made available
for the Fall 1995 semester meal
plan.

Terry states that one reason
for the installation of the five meal
plan as an option to all upper class
students is that there was no worth-
while reason to restrict the option
to a much more limited popula-
tion.

Terry admits that this change
was not on his agenda when he
assumed the office in March, but it
was brought up as a student con-

cern by the Student Advisory Com-
mittee to the Director of Auxiliary
Services.

Both Richard Terry and the
SAC feel that student input was the
important factor in bringing about
this change.

Senior co-chair of the com-
mittee Jill Dyer says, “We just

‘pushed them into checking it out.”

“The SAC put all the empha-
sis on making the Five Meal Plan
available to more students, and
consequently, if the new plan does
not work out, it will be all their
fault as well,” Terry says.

The economic motive for mak-
ing the Five Meal Plan available to
all upperclassmen is the theory that

the more people, the better. The
profit will be better, and so will the
quality of the food and more di-
verse the choice of what there is to
eat.

Terry also hopes that access to
the five meal plan by more stu-
dents: will satisfy their needs for
good and nutritious food, and at
the same time bring more people
together for a better sense of com-
munity.

Auxiliary Services is willing
to give this new option a chance,
but the bottom line is that if the all
upper class access to the five meal
plan is not justified by the financial
returns at the end of the meal plan
registration period, then the spring

semester will be the only semester
in which this meal plan option is
offered.

In fact, over the next few
months all of the meal plans will be
reviewed to see whether there is
the possibility of a more diverse
selection for meal plan options.

Other-items up for review are
bonus bucks, alternatives to bonus
bucks, declining balance and the
potential use of the Cat Card in
more places on- and off-campus.

Terry has said that as in the
case of the five meal plan, student
input will be instrumental in de-
ciding what to do in reviewing
possible changes in Auxiliary Ser-
vices.

Candidates

sound off

in debate

By MATTHEW EIRICH
News Editor

In a civilized discussion of the
issues facing the town of Davidson,
the candidates for the town Board
and Commissioners and for Mayor

. gathered in the 900 Room last

Monday to express their opinions
ona variety of topics from housing
to drug use to special sidewalks.

The debate was divided into
two parts. In the first, candidates
were asked one question from a,
pre-determined list of 17, which
they had been given ahead of time.
Each candidate was allowed no
more than three minutes to answer
this question.

The second part allowed the
audience to ask questions specifi-
cally to one candidate or generally
to them all. There was no time
limit placed on the candidates’
answers.

A reception, sponsored by the
SGA, took place afterward.: The
SGA organized the debate, helped
‘to write the questions, and Presi-
dent Bill Gullan moderated and
Vice-President Warren Buford
kept time.

Many of the questions and re-
sponses dealt with town-college
relations. For instance, many can-

didates cited the incipient arrival
of Cosmic Coffee as a perfect ex-
ample of where students’ and town-
residents’ needs coincided.

Other issues such as drug and
alcohol use in the community,
drunk driving, and the beliavior of

- off-campus students were raised in

the formal question period and the
discussion that followed.

For instance, a few candidates
agreed it was a good idea for the
SGA and the town to collaborate
on a plan to combat drunk driving.
One even suggested that the two
governments provide sober rides
to Back Street Cafe and the Corner
Pub.

Many candidates mentioned '
that the Land Plan just approved
by the town will establish low-cost
housing for students who would
like to live off-campus.

In the first part of the pro-
gram, one candidate -was asked,
“Do you think that creating ‘user-
friendly’ pedestrian sidewalks and
bicycling paths throughout all of
the Town of Davidson is a high
priority? If so, how would you go
about funding them?”

The response was shorter than
the question: ”No, they are not a
priority, and I would not fund
them.”

top of the stairs. Arrington called
this requirement “ludicrous,” be-
cause the policy already requires a

- risk manager to remain in the base-

ment.

Inresponse, Council members
suggested that entering the base-
ment during an open party be made
an Honor Code violation for un-
derage students.

For the past three months, the

Council has struggled to work
within the new alcohol policy,
while attempting to address the
problems the policy presents.

The policy established a stan-
dard which the Council claims is
unreasonable and, at times, unnec-
essary. After a night of witnessing
the frustration in the alcohol policy,
Shames concluded, “We must re-
vise the policy.”

Shames hopes to bring an ap-
peal to President Kuykendall who
has the power to overturn the
policy.
