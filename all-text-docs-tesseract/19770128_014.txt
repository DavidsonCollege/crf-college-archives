By DEAN EKLUND
Staff Writer

The Davidson wrestlers par-
ticipated in The Citadel Tour-
nament at Charleston with six
other teams Saturday.

Pembroke State with five
winners in their respective
weight classes won the cham-
pionship with Duke Univer-
sity placing second and The
Citadel third.

Davidson came up on the
short end, finishing seventh.

Davidson claimed two
bronze trophies. Pat Dulaney,
defending champion in the

142-weight classification, fin-
ished third in his weight
classification. Rob King
claimed third in the heavy-
weight division.

Monday night, Davidson
suffered a 32-22 setback to
Livingston College at Salis-
bury. Nevertheless, Dulaney
raised his record to seven wins
against two losses with a win.
Mark Scandling and Scott
Phillips also posted wins for
Davidson.

The next home match for
the wresting team is against
Hampden-Sydney February 4
during Midwinters.

“Scores inevitably came in.

“T think diversity is import-
ant. In a sense the school itself
will filter all that diversity
out, because someone who will
want to be really diverse-won’t
apply to Davidson,” he said.

“What I think about is the
diversity of the student body
when I vote,’’ said Cornwell.
‘“When I look at a folder my
intuition is at work.

“I’m also looking for the
way a person expresses him-
self, the scores he has and the
high school record.”
