DR. FRASER HOOD TO SPEAK
AT Y SERVICE NEXT SUNDAY

Dr. Frazer Hood, professor of Psy-
chology, is to be the speaker at the “Y”
service Sunday night. He will ‘in all
probability base his talk on some. phase
of the life of Christ.

Dr. Hood is the first speaker from the
faculty to address the “Y” this year, and
from past experience we know he will
bring a message to the student body
which will prove both helpful and inter-
esting.

OUTLINE OF DR. HOOD’S SUN-
DAY SCHOOL LESSON

Read Isa. 28 :1-13.

1.. There are a great many reasons
why the use of strong drink should be
condemned, but all can be classified un-
der three heads. What are they?

2. Let every man come with one spe-
cific objection to the use of intoxicating
liquors.

3. What does the prophet mean by the
phrase, “They have erred through wine,”
and “Through strong drink they are out
of the way?” (Ver. 7).

4. How is a drunkard like a “fading
flower?” And how does the fat valley
become a fading flower?

5. In verse 9 who speaks and what is
meant?

6. Why Ephraim rather than some
ether tribe in verse 1?

DWIGHT CHALMERS VISITS Y
AT ELON AND GUILFORD

In his capacity as acting State Secre-
tary, Dwight Chalmers visited Elon and
Guilford last week to confer with the
leaders of the “Y” work there. He re-
ports the Guilford Y as very strong and
active, being much similar to the one
here. The Elon Y is merely onevof a
number of Christian organizations
grouped together under a religious or-
ganization board.

At Elon, the Y. M. C. A,, the Y. W. C.
A. Ministerial Band, Volunteer Band,
and two Christian Endeavor Societies all
meet af the same hour just, after supper.
This gives everyone a chance to partici-
pate in a religious meeting, and there
is a further provision that—if any one
of these groups reaches as many as 40
members, it must divide. With two co-ed
Christian Endeavors on the hill, there
would seem to be little fear of divisions
in the ranks of the “Y.”

Elon, however, has a very active com-
munity service program. An excellent
night school is being conducted, ‘and
supervised playground work is carried
on in both the white and the colored
schools. One afternoon each week the
children are given talks on religious edu-
cation.

Local pessimists may be interested to
note that the Elon students are required
to attend both church and Sunday
School. Both colleges have a great -ad-
vantage over Davidson in) their: social

programs, in that they are co-educa-

to put on a social every month, while

On last Sunday, Layton Fraser and
Willis Booth went on a Ministerial depu-

Booth presented “The Call.”

of derogation. One of his best points
was that the leader of the forces attack-,
ing the Klan would not bring himself he-
fore the eyes of the country if he could
not substantiate his charges.

In completing the defense of the nega-
tive, Carr defined the Klan and quoted
its constitytion, showing that it recog-
nized its place in relation-to the govern-
ment. He also compared it favorably to
other organizations.

Judging from the behaviour of the au-
dience the debate was surely a success,
for not once did any sign of restlessness
appear among them nor did their atten-
tion once flag.
