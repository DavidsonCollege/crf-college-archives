Chambers Building.

The new band, under the di-
rection of sophomore Kurtis
Hess, made its first appearance
at the Davidson-Catawba foot-
ball game in Charlotte Satur-
day. Spectators seemed sur-
prised and delighted to hear a
repetoire which included more
than the customary marches.

NEW SPIRIT

“We'll be playing jazz, Dixie-
land, swing. and some popylar
tunes.” Hess explained. “We're
trying to build up morale and
spirit, and we think Davidson
students are tired of hearing
the same thing over and over.
The members of the band like
this kind of music instead of
usual marches.”

“The Wildcat Band will play
at all home games. and at all

but one out of town game. We

Oriental Salutations
Depict Respect, Love

By KOOKIE KAPOOR
Richardson Scholar

Every country has its

own traditional manner of

greeting; in the western world it is the handshake. The

countries of the east have

a more diversified nature,

with a greater accent on symbolical value.

The Japanese bow in greet-
ing; in India, the movements
and gestures are both complex
and simple, but no matter what
category they fall into each
conveys a deep and genuine
sense of respect and affection.
A proper understanding will
furnish a true insight into the
rich, significant meaning of the
typical Indian form of greet-
ing.

The “namaste” is the simpler
form of greeting; it parallels
the western hand-shake, usual-
ly being a rather cursory or
fermal gesture. The namaste
involves the joining of both
palms of the hands, the fing-
ertips pointing upwards to-
wards the tip of the nose.

The hands should be kept
in a rather hard-pressed posi-

tion, with no movement to eith-
er side or up and down; they
should be still and motionless,
the palms coming up to the
chest, the thumbs directly in
front of the throat, and the
joined fingers forming a can-
opy like barrier.

At first glance, the namaste
appears to be just another form
of greeting. However, there is
a deep symbolism and _signif-
icance of meaning in these ges-
tures. The grecting evolved in
the ancient days of feudal lords,
days of discord and distrust,

accepted and recognized fact.

The folded hands convey a
sense of physical helplessness
being placed high on the chest
in full view of the other per-
son. The finger nails pointing
upwards towards the nose pre-
vent a sudden lightning jab.
The elbows are turned inward,
touching the ribs; the same
principle of physical impetency
applies to this. The placement
of the hands and arms also

forms an effective safeguard
over the vulnerable parts of the

body.

Besides the physical aspects,
the namaste has a hygienic sig-
nificance. The hand shake
brings the palms of two people
together. If one has a skin in-
fection. he or she is liable to
convey it to the other. The
namaste overcomes this seem-
ingly insignificant, and, to
some, rather farfetched, dang-
er.

No part of the body is
brought into contact with that
of another person. Indeed in
the namaste distance is not a
barrier as long as one can see
and hear the other.

This is not a vainglorious at-
tempt to install meaning and
significance into a seemingly
insignificant motion; an under-
standing of the namaste will
give’ you considerable pleasure
if you should have the oppor-
tunity of seeing it performed.

IROTC Corps Revamps,
‘Cadets Get New Duties

The Davidson College ROTC Cadet Corps has undergone a major change with-
in its organization this year. The Corps will be composed of four companies, an
n semester there will be only twenty-seven
officers throughout the entire set-up as compared to the seventy or more officers

with a Cadet Captain in charge.
The company commanders for
this semester are Ed Kizer, Ted
Quantz, Tom Parker, and Bob
Denham.

The Honor Guard will re-
turn to its former size of only
one platoon, approximately
thirty men, with Cadet Ist -Lt.
Willlem' F. Deane as its com-
mander.

Cadet Captain Ervin Duggan
has been assigned the position
of commander of the Band
Company. The musical unit will
participate only in military
functions and will not double
as a pep .band as it has prev-
iously done.
