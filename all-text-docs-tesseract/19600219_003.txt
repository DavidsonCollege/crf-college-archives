THE DAVIDSONIAN

SIDE LINES
ON oPORTS

THE RANGY BETA took a tap-off at the foul circle,
faked, wheeled and hooked cleanly into the basket —
the Sigma Chi basket. The White Cross boys, stared in
comic incredulity — and a sports editor realized that
he had pulled off probably the most spectacular play of
the intramural season. One consolation — they beat us
by four points, not two.

TRUSTEES, BESET BY crusading integrationists
and special publications, must have thought the whole
darn place had gone to the — Wednesday afternoon.
A_ persistent nt reverberated from first-floor
Chambers, the heart of Davidson College. The heart was
beating a little fast, for Coach Heath Whittle had half a
dozen of his winter track boys running sprints up and
down the main hall.

With four or five inches of snow on the track, out-
door workouts had slushed to halt. Basketball players
teemed in the gym so Whittle moved over to Chambers.
Actually the hardwood floor in the downstairs hall is
the nearest thing Davidson has to an indoor board track.

JIM NUCKOLLS was réleased from Mercy Hospital
yesterday after undergoing an operation that may de-
termine whether or not he will ever play basketball
again. All indications, the operation was a success. It
seems that Big Jim didn’t have any ligaments in one of
his ankles and they had to fix him up with a few.

ast year, when they finally gave brother Red a diploma,

club. Not that that’s so unusual, but the other night,

artist, scored 56 points against another squad of future

THE SOUTHERN CONFERENCE wrestling tourna-
ment'to be held here March 3-5 is a first for Davidson.

Some of the finest wrestlers in the nation will be here—
the dollar admission charge for the entire three-day
tournament is peanuts when you consider the calibre of
competition on hand. The local contingent, having a
sonrewhat =, season, might be represented in the
winner’s circle by Milton Gee, who just missed last year,
or big Jim Alexander, who shows tremendous promise
as a sophomore.

AS ALWAYS, the quality of refereeing for the in-
tramural basketball games is lousy. The IMAC is vir-
tually powerless to do anything significant about the

roblem. The problem could become serious. Sporadic
ist slinging and unnecessary pile-ups are becoming
commonplace. At least one or two teams are winning
with rough-house tactics that make a farce out of the
rules book. It is not inconceivable that a full scale brawl
between rabid fraternity rooters could develop from
the impromtu skirmishes that get out of hand on the
court.

Until a better solution to the problem is worked
out, it is up to the fraternities to provide the most com-
petent referees available. Too often the chore is forced

Hot Catfish Host
Citadel Is Last

BY BILL GODWIN

mers will really have to shine
at the Citadel to break the rest
of the eight school records es-

If things came off this
afternoon as planned (by
Coach Dwight Shoe), his
Catfish now own an 8-1 rec-
ord on the season with a
single meet remaining —
at the Citadel next Satur-
day.

Before the Emory splash
here today, Shoe sized up the
relative strengths of the two
teams, noting that the Wildcats
had better average times than

tablished by the 1959 squad
under Coach George Tucker.

“But,” he said, “I -expect
Scott to come through on his
breaststroke. In the 50-yd. free-
style, Hellier is swimming close
to a 25 (seconds).”

The standing Davidson rec-
ord in that department was set
in 1956 by Tommy Rivers. Bob
McDonald and Tom Hudgins
have also cut their freestyle
times in recent weeks.

will be the meet of the South-

ern Conference! We're just as
good as they are, but they
have more depth.

“They have a little bit of
everything,” he added.

If the Wildcats..can pull a
win over the Bulldogs, who
rank with V. M. I. as tops in
the Southern Conference, they'll
be tied with V. M. I. for the
conference champio nship.
Davidson’s V. M. I. meet is the
lone blotch on their record.

in the 147-pound division as

With one-sided victories in

ized Alexander a point for

The Keydet’s Dennis Merk-
linger wound up the afternoon
with an impressive 5-1 victory
over Alex Porter.

He said the Georgia team
also had a slight edge over
the Cats in diving. This could
be, he said, since Davidson
diver Jack Rose has been suf-

from back strain. ;

“We seem to be pretty well
