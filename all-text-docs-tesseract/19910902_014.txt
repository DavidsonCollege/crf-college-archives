Davidson Soccer Ready For Season Of High Expectations

By TOM PRICE

The excitement surrounding
Davidson soccer has reached ‘an
all-time high. The success of last
year’s squad has caused expecta-
tions to soar as the ‘Cats enter the
1991 season.

Head coach Charlie Slagle is
thrilled by the enthusiasm sur-
rounding his program and believes
that the high expectations are jus-
ufied. Last year’s team posted a
15-7-2 record while gaining wins
over nationally ranked opponents
suchas Duke and the University of
South Carolina.

Slagle makes it clear that the
tcam’s goal for 1991 istoecarna bid
to play in the NCAA tournament.
Last year’s team received careful
consideration by the selection
board, but was not selected as one
of the 28 teams for the tournament
despite finishing the season ranked
21st in the nation.

The “Cats schedule is once again
a rigorous one. They will play 6
teams who were invited to the
NCAA tournament last year and
every one of their opponents is a
Division 1 school.

Slagle prefers a difficult sched-

ule for two reasons. First, he wants
to provide the fans with the best
soccer in the country. Second, the
quality of the schedule matters a
great deal to the NCAA selection
committee. Although certain wins
would obviously weigh more
heavily than others, Slagle believes
that if his team can win 14 games
this year they should have an ex-
cellent shot at being invited.

The first five games will pro-
vide the ‘Cats a tough test. Junior
stopper Matt Spear commented,
“Without a doubt, we have one of

the most challenging schedules in
the nation, which our first five
games clearly demon-
strate.”

On September 8 the
team opens the season at
the University of South
Carolina. The Gamecocks
are ranked #9 in the pre-
season national rankings.
Coach Slagle expressed his
hope that many Davidson
students will make the trip
to the Sunday afternoon
game. The second game of
the year will be in Chapel ¥
Hill where the ‘Cats will |)
take on the 10th ranked Tar yj
Heels.

It doesn’t get much eas-
icr after these first two chal-
lenges. Thenexttwo games ©
will be at a tournament in
Richmond where Davidson
will face 19th ranked Co- §
Jumbia and 17th ranked
Richmond. On September §
8, the Wildcats will finally
return home to face the 1 1th
ranked Duke Blue Devils.

This game, along with 5
of the other 7 home games, will be
played on the newly remodeled
Richardson field. Over the past
year lights have been added and a
segment of the track removed to
prepare the football field for soc-
cer action at night. At the Duke
game the athletic department is
hoping to break the soccer atten-
dance record of 1,357, which was
set last year during Homecoming.

Conference play in the Big
South will also be challenging.
While Radford, Coastal Carolina,
and Davidson appear to be strong-
est teams, other schools such as

Campbell, UNC-Asheville, and

Winthrop also figure to be com-

petitive. The Radford game should
be particularly fun for the fans
because it will feature two of the
most prolific scorers in college
soccer. Radford’s Dante Washing-
ton was the nation’s leading scorer
last year, while Davidson’s Rob
Ukrop placed third.

Ukrop will once again lead the
Wildcat attack. After his 22 goals
and his recognition as a 2nd team
All-American last season, coach
Slagle realizes that Rob will draw
a lot of attention from the oppo-
nent’s defense. Last year he had a
team-high 12 assists, but Slagle is

Field Hockey Will Keep Crown

By CHRIS HOOD

In 1990, Davidson’s Field
Hockey team enjoyed its most
successful season ever by posting
a 14-1-2 record and capturing the
Deep South Tournament.

Although the Wildcats could
easily kick back their paws and
enjoy the benefits of their outstand-
ing 1990 campaign, this year’s
squad instead faces what should be
the toughest season in school his-
tory.

Davidson’s 1991 schedule,
which begins at home against the
University of the South on Sep-
tember 8, includes powers such as
James Madison, Virginia Com-
monwealth, Richmond and Duke.

“You don’t get better unless you
play better teams,”’ said head coach
Betsy Pryor. “We’ ve gone as far as
we can in the Deep South; that’s

the reason for our tougher sched-

ule.”

With only two players gone from
last year’s squad, the 1991 edition
of the ‘Cats willrely onexperience
and leadership from ates
men.

“We have lots of weesieie'c on this
team,” said Pryor. “‘The girls are

very strong individuals and are a
very close team.” Pryoralso praised
the freshmen, who are adapting
quickly to the college game and
will add a great deal of depth to the
squad.

The club’s aim is to earn a spot in
the South Region rankings. But
because the South is regarded as
the most difficult region in the
nation, cracking the top 6 will be
quite a challenge.

“We want to hang with the best
teams to prove where our program
has gone,” said junior sweeper
Jennifer Roos, Davidson’s Most
Valuable Player last season.

“T think we have a great team,”
said sophomore goalkeeper Emily
Coleman, “but we will have to
make a lot of adjustments.”

For the ‘Cats, though, the most -

difficult adjustment may be an off-
field situation..

Coach Pryor has been forced to
remain at home due to complica-

tions with pregnancy since the day ©

before practice began. She will be
unable to see the team in action for
at least two months. “I hope to be
back for the Deep South Tourna-
ment,” said Pryor.

In the interim, assistant coach
Betsy Brown has taken over the
helm for Davidson. She runs prac-
tices and prepares the team on the
field in between video sessions
and discussions with Pryor.

“T talk with Coach Pryor every
day,” said Brown, who played for
Pryor in high school. “I know her
philosophy and style pretty much,
butit’s good to have her asa safety
net. I was pretty overwhelmed at
first, but we pretty much have the
situation well in hand.”

Especially considering the chal-
lenging and difficult. circum-
stances, Brown appears to be doing
an outstanding job.

“Coach Brown is doing a great
job of keeping the team together,”
said senior wing Mary Russ, who
shares the duties of team captain

with senior center Rpek/milbieier a

Beth Pharr.

On the field, the ‘Cats Gould
have a balanced attack. Roos (9
goals) and junior inside forward
Simone Plaisance (8 goals) will
help to-anchor the offense -while

confident that Robcan take advan-
tage of the double and triple-team-
ing of the opposition and
have even more assists
this year.

Despite his individual
achievements, Ukrop
remains focused on the
team goals. He explained
the keys to success this
year, “We need to build
on last season and main-
tain the team chemistry
that allowed us to over-
come teams that some-
times had more talent.”

More specifically,
Ukrop feels that Matt
Spear’s leadership on
i defense and Lance
Long’s ability to score
goals on the offensive end
| will be key elements in
+ the teams success.

Senior Co-Captain
Lance Long will be
| making aswitch from the
“sweeper” spot to play in
Sone of the offensive

midfield positions.

Long is a strong candi-
date for All-South honors this
season.

Robert Malinzak, David
Neiland, Phelps Sprinkle, Preston

Yarborough, Glenn Smith, Andy _

Haile, Mike Newton, and fresh-
man Zack Eastman will also be
significant offensive contributors.
Junior Lance Kinerk also figures
to make a large contribution if he
can recover from monocucleosis.

Senior Spider Wormuth and
sophomore John Sampers will start
in the midfield. Other midfield
players will be Preston Yarbor-
ough, Ben Hayes, Mike Newton,

Andy Schwab, and freshman
Tommy Sutter.

Slagle considers defense to be
the team’s strength. The defense is
indeed solid with All-South candi-
dates Matt Spear, Craig Omli, and
Cliff Castelloe returning. Sopho-
more Ed Denning will also play a
significant role in Davidson’s de-
fense.

The goalkeeper spot is still “up
for grabs,” but the “Cats are sure to
remain strong in this position.
Currently, Senior Doug Long and
freshmen Alex Deegan and Neal
Andrewsare all playing well. Long
has valuable college experience,
but both Deegan and Andrews have
excellent high school credentials.

Coach Slagle admits that he has
never been more excited about a
team entering the season. He ex-
plained that last year’s success
“kind of fell on us,” but this year
the players are aware of what they
can do.

Their determination has been
reflected in their off-season work.
Slagle says the players returned in
“the best shape I’ve ever seen.”

This allowed the team to skip
pre-season fitness tests.

Slagle explains, “They were-
n’tnecessary and all it would have
done was take away a day of prac-
tice?” or. ; tA
The ‘Cats seem focused and
Slagle doesn’t hesitate tocommend
his players. “The intensity during
practice’ has been superb,” -he
commented.

Matt Spear summed up the
team’s outlook on the ’91 season,
“Last season’s success gained us
credibility. I hope that success this
season will solidify our position in
the national limelight.”
