Once again, U.S. News and World Report has published their list of
the top colleges and universities in the United States. Unfortunately for
Davidson, however, we took an eleven spot nose dive on their score
sheets this year. Why the plummet? Have our admissions standards
fallen so sharply in the past year? No. Did U.S. News get wind of all
the graduate students in teaching positions? Doubtful. Do we just bite
this year? Of course not. Davidson’s drop from the list was based pri-
marily on our financial resources and spending per student and faculty
member. The qualification is, quite simply, numeric.

Many students have been perturbed by the U.S. News ranking, as they
can no longer claim affiliation with a “top ten” school: Several are even
more embarrassed at:our classification as the second “best buy” in the
country, joking frequently about Blue Light Specials: on nvolle ge ae
at Davidson. We needn’t be so upset.’ ~~

U.S. News bases their survey on such an odd range of data that quali-
fication stems as much from matter financial as academic. Let’s not
worry ourselves about a drop in popularity amongst the media. We know
our where our strengths and weaknesses lie without the help of a publi-
cation which needs to give away free radios in order to get subscribers.

Out of Line

’ Last week, four. Davidson seniors, (Annie Adams, Cammie Coving-
ton, Sterling Freeman, and John Howell), sent out a letter cautioning stu-
dents about alcohol abuse. However noble their intentions may have
been, their action came across to many as a shamelessly condescending
act of self-promotion. The “holier than thou” tone of the letter inspired
several to wholeheartedly hurl the offending material into the nearest
Post Office trash can, without reading past the third line.

Of greater concern than the tone of the poorly written treatise is the
presentation of the document under the SGA letterhead. The SGA never

approved the letter, nor did the Patterson Court Council, the Dean of .

Students Office, or any other official branch of the college. The initiative
of the authors might have been more admirable if they did not disguise
their individual action under the edifices of the SGA.

In closing, it is the distinct hope of The Davidsonian that individuals
will actually direct their philanthropic efforts through official channels
of college life if they are going to risk suggesting that their words are rep-
resentative of those organizations. We also hope that the individuals paid
for the mailing of this letter themselves rather than used funds derived

from the Activities Tax Council to deliver their message.

Is Davidson a Suitcase School?

To The Editor:

A strange practice has
recently become the norm
on the freshman halls at
Davidson this semester.
Every Friday afternoon,
three quarters of the class
pack their suitcases and
head towards rival schools
in order to find something
to do over the weekend.
The decision made by
Dean Terry forbidding up-
perclassmen from enter-
taining freshmen in the
weeks preceding the open-
ing of the Court has had
serious side-effects. For a
large proportion of the
freshman class, Davidson
has become a suitcase
school.

The past few week-

‘| ends have seen large

groups of freshmen leave
campus in search of things
to do. Groups have ven-
tured to rival schools in-
cluding Chapel Hill, as

wellas Duke, Durham, and
Salem. Some of the trips ap-
pear to have been successful,
but others have been less so.
Thirteen freshmen from Belk
travelled all the way to Wake
Forest last week simply to
discover that the rumor of a
free for all 27 keg party was
just that - a rumor. Obvi-
ously, some things were just
not meant to be.

However, on a more se-
rious note, the phenomena
can be seen as something
which is a little alarming.
The open house policy on the
Court, combined with the
small sizeof the student body,
has always prevented this
from happening at Davidson

in the past. Not only is ita |
practice which suffocates any.

social life that the school
itself tries to encourage, it
also alienates those people

who cannot afford to leave

campus each weekend, or
who simply lack the trans-

portation.

Whilst it is normal that
not everyone stays at school
over the weekend, the fresh-
men class has recently taken
this to an extreme. A fire

_alarm set off in the middle of

last Saturday night on Fourth
Cannon showed that less than
15 girls from that hall had
stayed on campus for the
weekend. All the others had
taken their suitcases as, far
afield as Atlanta and Char-
leston.

With the opening of Pat-
terson Court to the freshman

~ class this past weekend, it is

hoped that this practice will
cease tO a great extent.
Davidson has never been, and
does not try to be a suitcase
-Schgol., There should be more
than enough todoon oraround
campus; and one hopes that
the class of 1995 will realize
this before too long.
Sincerely,

JO BURROWS, '95

Humphrey Responds to Cartoon

To The Editor:

The cartoon in last
week’sDavidsonian shows
amisunderstanding of both
the Spencer House and the
fourth eating house which
is currently being organ-

ized. All three women’s ©

eating houses are currently

stable and in no danger of -

“sinking” as Spencer was
portrayed to be in the car-

toon. The intention of the
new women’s eating house
is to broaden Davidson’s
women’s eating options as
well as to increase their par-
ticipation on the PCC and the
SGA. About 60% of the
males at Davidson partici-
pate in Patterson Court while
nearly 90% of Davidson
females are affiliated with
eating houses. Obviously the

representation is dispropor-
tional The fourth house will
also help to ensure the validity
of the self-selection processand
alleviate some overcrowding.
It is up to the women of
Davidson to work together to
organize this house and to pre-
serve what is already estab-
lished.

Sincerely,

JENNIFER HUMPHREY, ‘94

To the editor:

Though last week’s
flyer was most likely of-
fensive to Davidson’s gay
community, we feel that a
much larger group was
wronged by the callous
words. - This prejudice
against the academically
oriented has probably ex-
isted on campus for a long
while, but we as freshman
are frustrated that such open
hostility exists in our col-
lege. We wish not to point
any fingers or to encourage
drastic action. We want
only toinstilla greater sense
of responsibility among
Davidson’s non- “Geek”
community members.

Many of us chose
Davidson because we were
searching for a place with

neat computers and the leg- .

endary Check CHAL center.
To reject any group on the
basis of questionable activi-
ties is surely in opposition to
the purpose of a liberal arts
education. How frustrating
itis for those of us who wish
to live in an open, supportive
environment when attitudes
such as these permeate our
campus. _ Xenophobia,
Geekism, homophobia, and
any other form of prejudice
stems from either fear or
ignorance. As we can safely
assume that most Davidson
students are not stupid, we

hallmates have deduced that
fear is at the heart of these
attacks. What is it that .you
people fear? Is it our pocket
protectors? Is it our horn
rimmed glasses? What can it
be???? Are youso insecure in
your programming abilities
that you have to degrade those
of us that camp out by the
keyboards? Though most of
us have no desire to rub shoul-
ders with “normal” people
down on the hallowed Court,
it would be nice to know that

we might be welcome (if there

was a late-Friday- night sys-
tem breakdown). How sad
that a community known for
