CHRISTIAN

ACTIVITIES

DR. J. M. WELLS TO SPEAK AT
“y” SERVICE ON SUNDAY

Dr. John M. Wells, president of Colum-
hia Seminary, is to be the speaker at the
Y. M. C. A. vesper service next Sunday
night. He is a graduate of Southwest-
ern University, Clarksville, Tenn., and
of Union Theological Seminary, at Rich-
mond, :

While a student Doctor Wells was a
football player and carries now the scars
of former battles on the gridiron. He
was pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church in Wilmington, N. C., for 20
years, from 1901 to 1921, during which
time this church increased with a rapid-
iiy that. was greater than the increase
in population of the city. For the year
1917-18 he was moderator of the Gen-
eral Assembly. In 1921 he assumed his
duties as the president of Columbia
Seminary, and is also professor of Pas-
toral Theology in that institution. Since
his arrival this seminary has taken on
new life. The students of the seminary
say such things as: “He is a prince,” and
“T would rather go on his class than
play a set of tennis,” which is saying a
lot, but Doctor Wells is just that sort of
man.

He is a thorough scholar, a forceful
speaker and a man’s man, and is recog-
nized as a real leader not only in the
Southern Presbyterian Church but
among ecclesiastical bodies generally.

While here Doctor Wells will conduct
several other meetings besides the Sun-
day night service, and interviews will
probably be secured for those who de-
sire them.

FIVE MEN COMPOSE THE “Y’
TEAM ON KINGS MT. TRIP

The Y. M. C. A. deputation which went
to Kings Mountain last week received a
hearty welcome, and an enthusiastic re-
sponse seldom met with in work of this
kind, The team was composed of Mc-
Kethan, Houghton, Sorrells, LaFar, and
Hillhouse, leaving Davidson Saturday
afternoon and returning Wednesday.

The team worked mainly in the High
School, especially among the boys. Four
meetings were held in the school during
the two days at which various members
of the team spoke on different phases of
the Christian life, especially as it related
to student life. The central thought of
the services was “Come Clean” in ath-
letics, in social life,.in school work, and
in religious matters.

On Sunday, the members of thé team
distributed themselves about *the various
churches assisting in the Sunday School
work, and meeting with the Young Peo-
ple’s Societies. Sunday afternoon a mass
meeting of the young people of the vari-
ous churches was held and the series of
incetings was inaugurated by a talk from
two of the Davidson boys.

Of especial interest is the athletic
work the members. of the deputation en-
gaged in. Monday afternoon the party
joined a group of High: School boys in a
game of baseball. Tuesday, the five Da-
vidson boys formed themselves into a
basketball team and defeated the Var-
sity team of the High School in a fast,
clean game. This game aroused great
interest and comment, especially as the
High School team is champion of the
surrounding district. Doc LaFar seems
to have been the star of the game.

On the whole, the trip could hardly
have been more successful, and several
decisions were formed as a result of the
meetings.

It was with very evident pleasure that
the Y. M. C. A. Board of Control an-
nounced recently that Buck Currie has
accepted the position of Davidson Y. M.
C. A. Secretary for next year. Buck, of
course, was president of the student
body last year, and our star baseball
pitcher. He is now principal of the Da-
vidson High School.

Buck was one of the leading spirits in
the Y. M: C. A. during his college ca-
reer, being on the cabinet two years as
secretary and vice-president, and having
charge of one of the Mission Sunday
Schools. There has never been any ques-
tion as to bis ability to fill the position
' of Y Secretary, and his decision to ac-
cept it came as a very pleasant surprise
to all concerned. -

C. E. TRAINING CLASS MEN
VISIT EPWORTH LEAGUERS
MOVIES SATURDAY NIGHT

Last Sunday afternoon the Christian
Endeavor Training Class sent a deputa-
tion to the Fairview Church, near, Mt.
Mourne, where they held a short con-
ference with the Epworth League lead-
ers of that place. The deputation con-
sisted of Gamble, McIntyre, J. L. Me-
Lean, and C. C. Miller. At the meeting
of the Junior and Senior League Gamble
and McLean made short talks, which
were well received and enjoyed.

For the near future the Training Class
is working on several interesting depu-
tations. J. L. McLean, chairman of the
training Class here, is in communication
with the leaders of Christian Endeavor
organizations at a number of points, and
states that a number of deputations will
be sent out soon. He is also in com-
munication with the State Secretary of
the Christian Endeavor and is making
arrangements to send delegates to the
District Convention at Belmont in April.
A small deputation to Center Church
will probably be arranged for the near
future,

Under the able leadership of Gamble
the class has decided to have a special
course for each phase of the work. This,
it is thought, will bring about the best
possible results» Although the deputa-
tion movement is a new one in the Chris-
tian Endeavor Training Class, much ac-
tivity along this line is planned for the
near future.

D.
R. O. T. C. HAS MUSEUM OF
CONSIDERABLE INTEREST

One of the novel features which added
much to the attractions of Junior Speak-
ing was the opening of the R. O. T. C.
museum to visitors on the last evening
of speaking.- Especially interesting was
the sand table reproduction of a see-
tion of the golf course extending across
the course in the general line of Hole
No, 2 and Hole No. 3 of the golf course,
from the negro cemetery across toward
Concord Road. This sand table map of
such a familar piece of terrain not only
gives an excellent opportunity to com-
pare the actual lay of the land with its
reproduction on such a map but is also
to be used in working out one of the
most practical military maneuvers ever
staged at Davidson.

A sham battle soon to be fought by
the different units of the Davidson Bat-
talion on this terrain is now being
worked out on this sand table by the
whole class of cadet officers. Company
“A,” under Cadet Captain Richards, with
the advice and assistance of Captain
Ellis, is to defend Cemetery Ridge
against an attack to be launched from
Concord Ridge by the other three com-
panies under Cadet Major Phillips, with

the advice and assistance of Major

Hearn. Both forces are to be fully
cquipped with machine guns and in ad-
dition light artillery and trench mortar
fire is to be assumed.

The rifle match with Georgia Tech to
he held Saturday promises to be a close
and interesting contest. Tech is reported
to have a record firing team and David-
son's best shots are to be selected to fire
this match,

Over 400 students and professors from
the universities in and around Vienna,
Austria, met at the University of Vienna
on January 17th for consideration of the
problem of alcoholism. The meeting had
been widely advertised and was attend-
ed by the President of Austria and many
cther prominent officials. A popular
professor spoke against alcoholism and
was followed by two students. Then a
resolution adopted by a of
3°5 to 15, asking the government to pre-
pare quickly a law prohibiting the use
of alcohol as a beverage.
