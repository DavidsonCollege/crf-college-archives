Henry Bucher, a sophomore, won the Davidson College ROTC
Motto Contest, it was announced Tuesday, February 14. The win- |
ning entry was “Parati Sed Paci” which, when translated means |

“Prepared but for Peace.”

offered to the winner. The motto will go on the school shoulder
patch, which will be worn by all cadets.

The selection committee was composed of Robert C. Stewart,

Downstairs, the student store
offers necessary school supplies
to its purchasers. Here one will
find “Modernage” nylon hose, “Sea-
Bee” swim fins. made-to-order
wedding tiles, prickly heat powder,
and baby booties at quite econo-
mical prices. Student store sales
for last year totaled $24,500.

Companion to the student store
is the smack bar where hot tama-
les, “bakon puffs,” and clam chow-
der provide refreshments during
study breaks and bull sessions.
Although busy fountain men are
not allowed to sell ice cream in
a cup. they may hand the pur-
chaser the ice cream in a cone
with an empty cup and the pur-
chaser may in turn preform the
cumbersome process of transfer.

The second floor of the Union
houses the Y. M. C. A. office,
student goverment headquarters,
and the offices of various campus
publications. Here also is located
the Music Room complete with a
three-speed phonograph bearing
the words: “Fixed—but not com-

pletely.” The most recent exami-
nation reveals that with the excep-
tion of the failure of the turn-
table to revolve, all parts are in
good working condition.

Mr. C. Shaw Smith, who has
served in the capacity of director
of the Union since its erection in
