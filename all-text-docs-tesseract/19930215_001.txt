Admission
Office Sees
Increase in
Applicants

By Sally Stone
Davidson’s class of 1997 may
seem distant to current students,

yet to the Admission office the . .
class of ‘97 is their priority. With
lications deadline of Febru-—

ary 1, the Admission: office is
“working literally around the
clock” to select Davidson’s next
freshmen class by.March 5, says
Dean of Admission Nancy Cable
Wells,

As of February 9, 2,331 regu-
lar decision applications had been
received. This is an increase of 95
applications from 1992. For early
decision, 227 students submitted
applications; 165 were accepted.
International student applications
rose 161 versus 153 in 1992.

The Admission office cur-
rently isreading these applications.
After each folder is read by an
admission member, he or she pre-
sents it to his or her colleagues,
where they work “‘torendera shared
decision.” If any questions arise
the faculty admission committee is
asked to make the final decision.
For the first time in several years,
the faculty committee is reading
approximately twenty percent of
random applications. The
committee’schairis Dr. Mahoney;
the other members are Drs. Barton,
Beeston, Serebrennikov, Foley,
and McCulloh.

While minority student appli-
cations have risen in the past year,
Dr. Cable Wells noted that minor-
ity recruitment and enrollment is
“among [the Admission office’s]
highest priority.” She stressed her
office’s goal to follow “the strate-
gic plan in continuing to diversify
the campus.” Asian students’ ap-
plications rose from 54 to 76; Afri-
can American applicants increased
by ten, from 36 to 46; in 1992, 33
Hispanics applied compared with
this year’s 39; and Native Ameri-

of Trustees in their recent meet-
ings this February. This was after
the Budget Committee, including
members such as the President,
Vice-President, Athletic Director,
Dean of Admissions, and College
Controller, came up with a recom-
mended budget to be approved by
the President and finally, the Trust-
ees.

Compared to the 8.9% in-
crease for the 1992-93 year, the
overall increase of 8.3% “repre-
sents a decrease in the increase,”

according to College Controller,
Edward Kania. : A letter. to
Davidson students and their par-
ents from President John
Kuykendall explained that “‘attract-
ing and sustaining the right
people—students, faculty and
staff— is the most important fi-
nancial priority of the College.”

The greatest amount of the
year’s increase will go to compen-
sation for faculty and staff as well
as to the increasing needs for fi-
nancial aid.

goods and services, operating costs,
and activity costs also account for
the annual increase in the total
charges.

Kania explained the “reality
of Davidson” is that “‘we are tu-
ition dependent.” There are two
reasons for this: the small student

‘body and the size of the College

endowment compared to other in-
Stitutions.

_ However, Davidson still ranks
79th out of 111 select private insti-
tutions in the country for total stu-

Davidson was placed 80th out of
108 schools. According to the
president, “our situation remains
virtually the same.”

According to Kania -and
Kuykendall, Davidson is commit-
ted to providing the students with
the best liberal arts education at the
lowest cost. Kuykendall stated in
his letter, “I will guarantee our best
effort, now. and in the future, to
maintain a prudent and stable ap-
proach to the determination of our
costs year by year.”

SGA Changes Guard

., «By Rachel Dunifon

On Tuesday, Davidson’sSGA
held an open meeting in Phi Hall to
hear the farewell remarks of former
President Anthony Foxx, and to
swear-in Alden Smith and Alice
Spivey as the student body’s new
President and Vice President.

At a SGA Senate dinner pre-
ceding the meeting, Dean of Stu-
dents Will Terry addressed the
senators, articulating some dreams
that he hopes Davidson will real-
ize in the upcoming years. These
include providing a wider range of
social options for students, which
involves expanded programs at
Baker Sports Complex, and the
development of what Terry be-
lieves is a much-needed new stu-
dent union. Other goals he has are
providing leadership development
programs to help maximize the
potential of Davidson’s student
leaders, involving more students
in cultural events and extra-cur-
ricular activities, and working to
improve the communication abili-
ties of students.

After the dinner, the meeting
moved to Phi Hall, where Anthony

Foxx made his farewell remarks to
the student body. He cited the hard
work of other campus leaders, as
well as of the SGA Senate, whose
“responsibility, diligence, and dis-
tinction” helped him to carry out
his duties. Foxx said that through-
out his term, he followed a “con-
stant philosophy that this campus
become:a more inclusive environ-
ment,” and believes that “Davidson
students must continue to say that
this school has something for ev-
eryone.”

Former Vice President Alden
Smith then took the floor, remark-
ing on Foxx’s diligent efforts at
community-building during his
tenure as President. Smith recog-
nized Foxx’s ability to communi-
cate and command respect from
faculty, students and trustees as an
essential component of Foxx’ssuc-
cess in his endeavors. Smith then
presented Foxx with acommemo-
rative chair, and Chancellor Leigh
Rawdon gave him a plaque honor-
ing his achievements.

After Foxx received these hon-
ors, he praised Rawdon’s service
to the SGA, and led the SGA ona

vote to approve Allison Sabel as
the new Chancellor. Sable was
approved unanimously.

‘Foxx then proceeded with the
swearing-in of Alice Spivey as the
new Vice President. In her re-
marks, Spivey noted her commit-
ment to bea strong liaison between
students and the SGA, and to work
on such areas as student-faculty
relationships, campus lighting, and
trustee contacts.

Foxx performed his final presi-
dential duty with the swearing-in
of Smith as the new SGA Presi-
dent.
