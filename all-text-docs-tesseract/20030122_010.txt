ming and diving teams competed in full force
against the College of Charleston last Satur-
day.

Senior Diego Marquez’s traditional senior
commemoration took place during the meet, a

celebration which swimmers comically nick-.

named “D-Day” due to the fact that Marquez
is the sole senior on the team.

His family, friends and brothers of his fra-
ternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, were all in atten-
dance, celebrating Marquez’ s athletic and aca-
demic successes throughout his four years at
Davidson.

The women’s team crushed the female Cou-

gars, 181-59.

119-107 defeat.

sisting of Sarah Laws ’04, Megan Perez ’05,

1:52.17.

free.

Casey Grimes ’06 pushed herself above and

* beyond in the 1650 free; her second-place

time of 18:32.11 in the 1650 free is now
ranked as the tenth fastest time in school
history.

The men’s team suffered from a slight loss
but managed to attain points in all levels and
with men from all grades.

Sophomore diver Chris Wrobleski led the
Wildcat men with a first place finish in both
the three-meter (197.25) and one-meter
(237.75) dives.

been outstanding additions to the Davidson
men’s team.

finish. He touched first in the 100 free with a
timé of 0:49.30 and second in the 200 free.

Taniors Sarah Laws and Vanesa Witt both a :

Runner of the Year in 1991, Kathy Beach was
one of the most prolific female runners in
Davidson history. Three times she was named
the Wildcats’ team MVP in both cross country
and track and field.

Beach was. the fastest Davidson runner in
every cross country meet in which she ran
during her four years save one, setting the
school record in the 5K in the conference
championships in 1991, a record which stood
for four years.

She was All-Big South in cross country both
years Davidson was a member of the confer-
ence. In the Wildcat record books, Beach still
holds four individual indoor track records
(1000 meters, mile, 3000 meters and 5000
meters) and four individual outdoor track
records (1,500 meters, mile, 3000 meters and
5000 meters), as well as two indoor relay
records (4x800 and sprint medley).

A four-year letterwinner in cross country
and track, Beach received the Goodwin-Exxon
Award in 1990-91, and earned the Rebecca
Stimson Award in: 1992.

Doug Cook was one of several terrific play-
ers for Lefty Driesell and Terry Holland from
1967-70. During his three seasons, he scored
1,221 points, which currently places him 20th
all-time at Davidson.

He never averaged below 13.4 points a
game in any of those three years, finishing his

career at 14.6 points per game.

He was an accurate shooter, hitting nearly 50
percent (49.6) of his field goal attempts. On the
boards, the 6-6 center averages 9.0 rebounds per
contest.

And when the pressure was on, Cook truly
rose to the occasion. As a sophomore, he was
named to the All-SoCon Tournament second
team. But in each of the following two seasons,
Cook earned SoCon Tournament MVP honors,
with the Wildcats advancing to the NCAA Tour-
nament all three of his seasons on the squad.

He was also a first team All-Southern Confer-

ence player his senior year when he averaged a
double-double for the season (15.6 points, 10.2
rebounds).

Jim Kelly had a brilliant career as a goal-

~ keeper forthe Wildcats’ soccer teams from 1983

through 1987. He was asecond team All-Ameri-
can in 1987 when he helped the Wildcats to an

11-7-3 record and a4-1 mark in the Southern
Conference.

He posted a school-record seven shutouts
in 1987 and was named to the All-Southern
Conference team for the third time.

Although his statistics for saves are in-
complete, Kelly still ranks third on the
Davidson career list in that category with
242.

He’s third in goals against average (1.36)
and third in career shutouts with 14.

Jerry Kroll was another of the basketball
stars from 1967-70, finishing his career with
1,165 points for 25th place all- time at
Davidson.

The 6-4 forward is still the most accurate
free throw shooter in Wildcat history, hav-
ing knocked down 83.5 (313 of 375) percent
of his free throws. A spectacular outside
shooter, Kroll connected on nearly 48 per-
cent of his field goal attempts.

Kroll’s best year came as a junior when he
averaged 16.0 points a game and missed just
19 of his 138 free throws, plus was named to
the All-Southern Conference first team.

He was also. named to the All-SoCon
Tournament second team in 1968, and first
team in ’69 and ’70.

On the defensive end of the court, he was
considered a terrific defender as well.. And
despite being listed as a forward, Kroll led
the team in assists as a senior with 81.

A banquet will be held prior to the men’s
basketball game against East Tennessee State
on Feb. 15 at 7 p.m., during which the four
honorees will be inducted.

The quartet will also be recognized during
the game in a halftime ceremony. For more
