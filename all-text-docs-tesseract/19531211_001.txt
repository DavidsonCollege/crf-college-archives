Group Holds Election;

Plans Christmas Dance

The Charlotte-Davidson Club to-
day announced that it will hold
its annual Christmas dance on
Christmas night.

Billy Knauff has been signed
to play for this yearly affair. As
yet a place has not been named
for the dance, although an an-
nouncement should be forthcom-
ing within the next few days. As
usual the dance will last from
nine til one.

At its first meeting last week
the club elected Floyd Feeney,
president, Tom Shaw, secretary-
treasurer; and Roy Palmer, dance
committee chairman. Tommy
Thompson will be in charge of
publicity, and Buddy Brown, Lacy
Keesler, Henry Faison, and Harry
Brownlee make up the remainder
of the dance committee.

The dance is one of the big
functions of the club each year
and has always been very much
of a success in the past. Generally
quite a few non-Charlotte students
attend and about 150 couples are
expected this year. Dance invita-
tions are now on sale by officers
and members of the dance com-
mittee; they may also be purchased

at the door.

One Special Service
ls Passed For 1954-55

The YMCA Board of Directors
passed this week on a decision by
the Special Services Committee of
the YMCA to have only one spe-
cial service during the school year
of 1954-55. The Special Services
Committee plan as passed by the
Board of Directors, will involve
having a religious emphasis week
of concentrated services during
early February of 1955.

Leighton Green, chairman of the
Special Services Committee, said
that there should be several ad-
vantages in having one service in-
stead of the traditional two. In
the first place, he said, it would
enable concentration of time, ef-
fort, and money into attaining one
effective week of services, with
more adequate preparation and
follow-up.

Second, he expressed a hope that
the committee can get help in
planning the services from the
University Christian Mission, a na-
tional organizations designed for
the purpose of assisting in col-
lege Christian emphasis weeks.

Green said that above ail, these
services, placed at the early spring
so that students would not be
crowded for time, should be con-
ducted with the single purpose of
bringing the Gospel to Davidson
students in such a way as to deep-
en their spiritual life and give
them incentive to study the Chris-
tian faith.

ROTC Gets ‘Superior’
In Lafest Inspection

A rating of superior, the high-
est ever received in the twenty-
three year history of the unit,
was awarded the Davidson ROTC
Department in the annual inspec
tion conducted the first of last
week.

Col. Jesse E. Graham, Chief of
the North Carolina Military Dis-
trict, headed the inspection team
and was accompanied by a team
of two officers.

Administration, training, and
supply, as well as the appearance
and drill of the Cadet Corps, were
covered in the thorough inspec-
tion. The cadre officer instructors
and the cadet officers conduct of
the drill were singled out for spe-
cial praise by the inspecting of-
ficers.

U. S, and Canada, is sponsored by
the Davidson College Artist Series.

Born in New York City and en-
tirely American-trained, Peerce
has shattered the belief that an
Italian tenor must come from
Italy. He is that rare singer whose
versatility makes him equally at
home in French and Italian opera,
oratorio, German lieder, and popu-
lar ballads.

Upon graduation from college,
Peerce decided to embark upon
a musical career. Following his
first concert with Toscanini in
1938 Peerce sang the special per-
formance of Rachmaninoff’s “The
Bells” with the composer conduct-
ing. In a remarkable debut with
the Metropolitan in 1941, he was
hailed as the first all-American
contribution to the great tradition
of operatic voices.

Star of opera, concerts, tele-
vision, radio, RCA Victor record-
ings and five motion pictures, the
noted vocalist holds an honorary
degree from the New York College
of Music. The first singer in the
75-year history of the school to
receive such an honor, Peerce
stands in worthy company. Other
recipients of the degree have in-
cluded Fritz Kreisler and Jascha
Heifetz.

Admission to the performance
of Toscanini’s “favorite tenor,” the
last concert of the series for 1953,
is free to all students upon pre-
sentation of their identification
cards. No seats will be reserved.

Highway 21 Bypass

A safe road to Charlotte
to be built next year.

‘Final determination of the route
of the Charlotte-Mooresville high-
way, bypassing Croft, Huntersville,
Cornelius and Davidson on the
west and costing approximately
$1 million, was announced this
week by the State Highway De-

is

partment.
This route will take the place
of the narrow’ and_= ragged

U,S. 21N, known as the Charlotte-
Davidson road. There have been
many accidents involving David-
son students on the old road, the
most recent of which was the one
involving Bob Brown and the boys
riding in his car.

This old road passes through
the four north Mecklenburg towns
and is badly overloaded with traf-
fic.

The plan for the new 21N calls
for acquiring right-of-way for a
four-lane highway, but the initial
project will provide only two
traffic lanes, according to M. E.
Beatty, engineer for the 10th North
Carolina Highway Division.

Construction will begin on the
northern section of the road ly-
ing in Iredell County. There will
be seven miles in Iredell and 14
in the Mecklenburg end.

4 Miles North

The new road leaves the present
21N four miles north of Charlotte
at the Hutchison homestead and
angles westward along the edge
of the Brockenbrough Airport. It
completely bypasses Croft, Hunt-
ersville, Cornelius and Davidson.
In Iredell, the new route connects
with N. C. 150 outside Mooresville
and therefore, actually, bypasses
the Iredell town.

The highway authorities  ex-
pressed the hope that the first con-
tract for the grading and struc-
tures on the northern end of the
road may be let by January or
February with the work to begin
as soon in the spring as weather
permits.

“Everyman, “A
To Be Presented

Drama comes to Davidson Mon-
day and Tuesday, Dec. 14 and 15,
when “Everyman” and “A Chron-
icle of Joe” are presented by the
Red and Black Masquers. Final re-
hearsals this week concluded four
weeks of practice.

The double performance will
utilize techniques similar to those
used last year in the Masquers’
production of T. S. Eliot’s “Murder
in the Cathedral.” Both plays will
use lighting effects rather than
scenery and most props will be
left to the imagination. The dress
will be modern. “Everyman,”
however, uses color as symbols to
portray the character of some of
its abstractions.

“Everyman” has a psychological
theme of man’s experience with
cold reality. A modern version, an
adaptation by Hugo von Hofmanns-
thal, will be used. The new ver-
sion is somewhat longer than the
original English morality play, and
one major difference in the theme

itself is that both Faith and Good
Deeds go with Everyman, and not
Good Deeds alone.

Everyman will be played by
Fred Summers. The rest of the
east includes: The Devil, Buddy
Beehler; Death, Tom Morgan;
Friend, Kerry Spiers; Paramour,
Mrs. Lamarr; Everyman's Mother,
Mrs. Daggy; Workman, Jack Gra-
ham; Steward, Phil Kukura; War,
Harold Hall; Mammon, Allie Cone;
Good Deeds, Page Hucklebee;
Faith, Ed Hadley; Prologue, Tom
Estes; Lord god, Bob Dunbar, Debt-
tor, Bill Berryhill; Thin Cousin,
Willis Briley; and Fat Cousin, Al-
bert Harris. Swain Loy is the di-
rector of Everyman.

“A Chronicle of .Joe,” written
and directed by Fred Myers, will
be presented following “Every-
man.” The theme of “A Chroni-
cle” is the futile attempts of a
little man with a small personality
trying to get ahead in the brutal
competition of the business world.

Solicits New Ideas

An an organizational mecting
last Tuesday night, the members
of the Student-Faculty Conference
Committee outlined the group's
objectives for the year.

The members hope to make the
committee one which will enable
students and faculty members to
cooperate in working out specific
problems pertaining to the college
life and program.

The committee is seeking ways
of increasing opportunities for
student-faculty contacts. It is be-
lieved that more contacts between
students and faculty members will
result in a better understanding of
their mutual problems related. to
the college.

As another of its objectives, the
committee wishes to serve as a
means for student expression on
various issues concerning student
life. .

Dr. Jay H. Ostwalt, the chairman
of the committee, stresseq that
the group will welcome sugges-
tions, opinions, and ideas from any
member of the student body. Any
student who has ideas to con-
tribute, or perhaps some project
to suggest, is urged to contact
some member of the committce.

Besides Chairman Ostwalt, the
committee is composed of Profes-
s8rs Ernest Beaty and Donald
Plott; Lyman Kiser, president of
the student body; Charlie Johnson,
president of the senior class;
Floyd Feeney, president of the
junior class; Jim Daughdrill. presi-
dent of the sophomore class; and
Max DeVane, freshman adviser.

Jim Daughdrill was elected sec-
retary of the group and the next
meeting was set for January 8th.
At that time definite projects on
which the committee will work
this year will be discussed.

came about because the present
route lies through sections which
have become densely populd#ed,
and also because the road is close-
ly paralleled on the -east by the
Southern Railway.

By

It illustrates what goes on in the
mind of the little man when he
reaches the inevitable limit to his
capacity. In Joe’s case his natural
timidity blocks any attempt to re-
lieve his frustration.

These heavy themes are relieved
somewhat by humorous scenes and
by the love story interwoven into
the plot.

Joe will be played by Professor
Ben H. Wilson, and abstractions
representing Joe’s self-confidence
are played by Dunbar Ogden, Her-
bert Russell, Bob Haywood, and
Ed Haley. Another abstraction
(who might easily be a real char-
acter also), Pam, Joe’s girl friend
representing happiness, is played
by Mrs. Sam Magill. The tragedy
is Joe’s irrevocable loss of self-
confidence and happiness.

“A Chronicle” also has _ real
characters: a milkman played by
Willis Briley; Phil Lee as a taxi-
man; a New York matron, played
by Mrs. Dole; and Alden Williams

MUSIC DEPT., YMCA
MAKE PLANS FOR
ANNUAL SERVICE

By CHUCK WRIGHT

The annual Davidson Christmas
Vespers service will be held on
Sunday night, Dec. 13, at 7:30 in
the college church. The Music De-
partment and the YMCA have been
concentrating their efforts toward
making this annual service as suc-
cessful as in previous years.

“Attendance for the service is
entirely voluntary, but everyone
should try to attend if at all possi-
ble. It is a wonderful opportunity
to worship God and to praise Him
for the wonderous gift in Jesus
Christ; not just an interesting pro-
gram to see and hear,” said Sam
Magill, secretary of the YMCA.

He also said that there is a good
possibility of the church being
full. If that is the case, chairs will
not be allowed to be put in the
aisles. The overflow crowd will
be put in Lingle Chapel, where
the music will be piped in by a
public address system.

The music program for the serv-
ice is as follows:

The prelude will be the ‘Christ-
mas Concerto,” Concerto Grosso,
No. 8. in G minor, Opus 6, by
Corelli.

1. Vivace; Grave; Allegro

2. Adagio; Allegro: Adagio

3. Vivace

4. Allegro

5. Pastorale

For the offertory, the Pastorale
Symphony (from “The Messiah,”
by Handel) will be played.

Both of the preceding selections
will be played by the Chamber
Orchestra, Kenneth Moore, direc-
tor.

The Prophecy will then be read
by Fred Summers, followed by
the following hymns:

1. O Come. O Come, Immanuel

2. The Hunter

3. In the Bleak Mid-Winter

Then comes the telling of the
Birth by the reader, followed by
the singing of “Alleluia, Christ

is Born.” “Gladly Sing This
Wonderous Thing,” and “The
First Night.”

The “Christmas Oratorio” comes
next, followed by the reading of

the Adoration. Then “When the
Savior Christ is Born,” ‘Noel,
Noel.” and ‘While Shepherds
Watched Their Sheep” will be
sung.

After the recessional, the
“Swiss Noel” will be played as a
postlude.

In past years, the Christmas
Vesper offering has gone as a
benevolent contribution for an
overseas cause. This year, however,
it will go directly into the service
the Y is doing on the campus and
in the community.

NOTICE

This week’s issue of The David-
sonian, the 1953-54 Safety Issue, is
the last issue before the holidays.
The staff takes this opportunity
to wish to those of Davidson a
Fine Christmas and a Happy
New Year full of all good things.

Motor vehicle accidents caused more deaths in 1943 than
any other type of accident among persons of college age.

Out of the 28,600 persons in this age group who died
last year, 7800 died in motor vehicle accidents. Twice as many
people died from motor vehicle accidents as from any other

type of accident, there being 4200 deaths from other accidents.

Marlin Announces
European Tour Plans

A great deal of interest in the
European tour being conducted
next summer by Mr. and Mrs. Grier
Martin has been shown by stu-
dents at Hollins, St. Mary’s and
Sullins as well as Davidson.

This Southern College Tour is
managed by the Brownell Travel
Bureau, the oldest tour service of
its kind in America. The tour
group of 25 to 30 students sails
from New York on the Italia on
June 4 and returns by the same
liner to New York on July 28.
Travel in Europe is by private
motor coach which permits a bet-
ter opportunity to see the native
homes, farms, villages, and out of
the way places on the way to and
from the great cities.

It is planned that the same type
of tour will be conducted during
the summer of 1955 by Dr. and
Mrs. S. R. Spencer.

Eight countries are visited on
the tour, with four days being
spent in London, four in Paris,
and three cach in Rome, Florence
and Lucerne. A professional tour
director stays with the group
throughout the European trip, pro-
viding effective arrangements for
living quarters, meals and other
services necessary to the comfort
and convenience of the group. Full
sightseeing trips are provided for
in the overall cost of the tour,
which is lower than any other tour
offering equal benefits.

The tour group will consist of
a maximum of 30 college age boys
and girls. Ten places have been
assigned to Davidson and these
must be reserved by January 15,
1954, or they will be subject to
use by any of the travel agencies
representing Brownell throughout
the country.

Further information about the
tour, including a fully descriptive
itinerary, may be secured from
Mr. Martin or Dr. Spencer.

The second ranking cause of ac-
cidental death among those of col-
lege age was drowning, claiming
1,650 victims.

Among diseases, which claimed
16,500 victims, tuberculosis was
the leading cause of death, taking
2,420 lives. This is less than a
third of the victims claimed by
automobile wrecks.

The second leading life-taker
among diseases in the college age
group was cancer with 1,980 deaths
This leaves 11,100 deaths caused
by other diseases.

These figures show one fact
clearly, that motor vehicle
accidents are far and away
the leading cause of death
among those of college age.

Here at Davidson the ratio of
deaths caused by motor vehicle
wrecks in relations to other causes
is infinitely greater.

According to information re-
leased by Dr. J. B. Woods, Jr.,
college physician, five or six Da-
vidson students have died in motor
vehicle wrecks within the last 10
or 15 years. During that time,
no Davidson student has_ died
from any other cause.

In connection with The Davidso-
nian safety issue, Lyman Kiser,
student body president, has made
the following statement:

“We have been fortunate in
having no one killed recently at
Davidson College, but there have
been several accidents that were
very serious and caused many
heartaches.

“As we leave for the holidays.
lets try to make safety a New
Year’s resolution.”

During the past year Davidson
College students have had one
close shave after another. Next
time we may not be so fortunate.
Now is not too soon to begin to
look out for the other fellow and
for yourself. The young mind is
quick, but death can be much
quicker.

Mary Sloop, Blythe
Given Literary Award

By DICK MOREHEAD

During the past week, North
Carolina’s highest literary award,
The Mayflower Cup, was awarded
to an already distinguished writer,
Dr. Legette Blythe, and to Dr.
Mary T. Martin Sloop for their
book , Miracle in the Hitls,’ a color:

ful story which is intimately asso-

ciated with Davidson College.

The Mayflower Cup is given
by the Society of Mayflower Des-
cendants for the best book of non-
fiction published by a North
Carolinian during the year. This
cup has been presented annually
since its inception in 1931 when
it was given for the best-judged
work from the entire literary
field. Since then it has developed
into the highest literary award for
non-fiction writing in North Caro-
lina.

Miracle in the Hills is the live-
ly personal story of Dr. Sloop, her
dedicated life and unique crusade
in the hill country of North Caro-
lina. She is a native of Davidson,
her father having been a profes-
sor of chemistry here. Her brother,
Dr. Wm. J. Martin, ably served
as president of the college in its
era of expansion from 1920 to
1929,

She attended Davidson as one of
its first co-eds. When she was a
girl, she had always desired to be
a missionary to China, but after
earning her medical degree, she
saw as great a need for medical
missionaries in the moun-
tains of North Carolina as in
China.

Immediately after her marriage
to Dr. Estace Sloop of Mooresville,
she and her husband left for the
mountain country.

They began their service in our
state when they rode on horse-
back into Crossnore, Avery Coun-
ty, North Carolina.

From the primitive conditions,
the poverty, “moonshining,” and
“lack of larnin’” which she found
there, a clean, forward, thriving

community has developed largely
through her untiring efforts.

She and her husband reinvig-
orated the weaving trade, built a
modern hospital and a new church,
and spearheaded a movement
which resulted in a modern 25
building school. This woman who
spent over forty of her now 79
years in this isolated community,
was honored with the — coveted
American Mother of the Year
Award for 1951.

The author or compiler of the
book, Dr. Legette Blythe. grad-
uated from UNC with high honors,
having distinguished himself in
writing and dramatics. After grad-
uation his varied life included
teaching in Greensboro, serving on
both the Observer and News staffs
of Charlotte, organizing and edit-
ing a small weekly newspaper,
The Mecklenburg Times, and a
period of travel and study in
Europe.

He began his creative writing
while working for the Observer.
Among his earlier successes are:
Marshal Ney: a Dual Life, Bold
Gallilean, Life-of Wm. H. Belk, ,_
and A Tear for Judas. He has also
written several locally-produced
plays.

Dr. Blythe is now a very active
and prominent citizen of Hunters-
ville, N.C., where he has devoted
his full time to creative writing
since 1950. Davidson College
recognized his outstanding
achievements by bestowing the
honorary degree of Doctor of Lit-
erature upon him in 1950.

The story of Dr. Sloop as com-
piled by Legette Blythe is in the
anectodal vernacular of the South-
ern Mountains of its setting and
is. full of the wry wit, steadfast
faith, and untiring service of its
worthy subject. There is a copy

of the book on the alumni shelf
in the Davidsonian Room of our
library.
