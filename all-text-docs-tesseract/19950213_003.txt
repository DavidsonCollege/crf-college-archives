Gullan gives goals, outlines plans for ’95

By MatTtTHew Eiricu
Assistant News Editor

This Tuesday the Gullan ad-
ministration will officially begin
when Bill Gullan takes the
president’s chair for the first time.
His goals are a combination of
short-term, daily needs, adminis-
trative re-organization within the
SGA senate, and philosophical,
long-range changes. Gullan says,
“I’m interested in the whole ball of
wax.”

Aggressive Leadership

According to Gullan, the
agenda his administration will pur-
sue is an amalgam of his vision for
the SGA and the vision of his Vice
President Warren Buford. Gullan
says that every goal is “what War-
ren and I have agreed to do ... I

view this as a delineated partner-
ship.”

Gullan says that both he and
Buford share an “aggressive lead-
ership” style which will aid their
partnership. Gullan recognizes that

his role in the SGA has changed

and he will have to modify his
behavior accordingly. “The tran-
sition from being a bomb-thrower
to being the president of the SGA
will be a difficult one. My main
job as president is to make the
SGA an organization the students
can be proud of and an organiza-
tion which is effective,” he says.
Changing the Committee
Structure

Some of the first changes of
the Gullan administration will not
be visible to most of the student
body. Rather, they will be what

Gullan calls “internal reforms” of
the committee structure; these re-
forms will be begun at Tuesday’s
meeting.

Gullan has created what he
calls an “Issue Network,” in which
every concern brought to the SGA
will be filtered through a system of
committees and general meetings
to be solved.

Atthe top of the network is the
student body, which will take its
concerns to the senators, who in
turn will forward the concerns to
the appropriate committee or coun-
cil. Committees and councils will
be composed of students and ad-
ministrators and will debate issues.

If a solution is found, the issues.

will never be brought before a full
meeting of the SGA, and 4 policy
change will be enacted at the com-

mittee level. If a solution cannot
be found in the committee, the
issue will be formulated into an
SGA resolution and presented to a
full meeting of the SGA.

Gullan also hopes to establish
a“follow-up mechanism” by which
the implementation of passed SGA
resolutions can be monitored. At
this stage the policy change begun
by the passage of a resolution will
become institutionalized. A reso-
lution passed by the SGA which is
not being implemented is labelled
by Gullan as a “problem,” and
“other means” must be sought to
solve the issue.

Issues: Admissions and Unity

One of the most innovative
issues of the campaign was
Gullan’s proposal to increase
Davidson student involvement in

the admissions process. His belief
that the students’ voice needed to
be heard stems from Gullan’s and
others’ perception that “we are
threatened with losing the people
who are the people who did not
excel in any one area but in many.”
Gullan also perceives an increased
emphasis on objective statistics like
SATs and class rank. Says Gullan,
“Numbers are not the only factor.”

Gullan fears that in the pursuit
of increasing the objective num-
bers of acceptees, the Admissions
Office is beginning to ignore other,
equally important, personal char-
acteristics. He cites ending the
official interviews with applicants
and plans to possibly scale back
the essay section of the applica-

student body) by Friday.

“Ideally,” says Whitehead,
“Recycling could become a for-
mal: part of the physical plant.”
She would like to see money go
toward an employee for sorting as
well as for an educational program
for students. “A big part of it is
education.” she says.

The petition was then submit-
ted with a letter to the trustees on

the Campus Life Committee. Re-.

cycling had not been on their

agenda, so there was little discus-
sion.

Former SGA President Eric
Rosenbach and current President
Bill Gullan both expressed that the
issue would be better addressed by
administration.

In the letter to the trustees,
Whitehead says, “Along with
Davidson’ s commitment to its stu-
dents, the college has an obligation
to the community.

North Carolina has passed leg-
islation prohibiting aluminum in,
landfills. Davidson has a legal re-
sponsibility to provide adequate
bins for aluminum cans (such bins
are not available in Baker or the
senior apartments).

In 1994, 4,062 pounds of alu-

minum were sold to students
through vending, the Union Café,
and Vail Commons. This figure
does not include the cans purchased
off campus. GDS reported that
1,045 pounds of aluminum drink
cans were recycled in 1994 by
Davidson.”

The SGA will also attempt to
increase awareness about recycling
through the new Campus Services
and Facilities Committee, created
to “investigate, research, and ad-
dress the problems that Davidson
students have with the services that
the college offers,”

Chairman Bob Bailey says that
the committee will focus on recy-
cling in residence halls because
that most directly affects the stu-

going to give her, and Anna asked
her for a clue. Anna’s mother
didn’t budge but instead told her
that onascale of one to ten with ten
being an engagement ring, her gift
was definitely a nine. After scor-
ing anine the year before, I figured
the only way to upstage that would
be to give her a ring.”

For the actual proposal Ruby
led Anna on a scavenger hunt
around Baltimore, leading her
eventually to a park where he met
her and proposed in song.

Mark and Anna plan to be

married on December 30 of this
year and will live in Baltimore
while Anna finishes school at Johns
Hopkins and Mark finds employ-
ment.
~ Senior Chad Huggins met
Molly Green in Dr. Lou Ortmayer’s
international politics class during
the fall semester of their sopho-
more year, and they have been
dating ever since. Says Huggins,
“Molly knew that anytime this se-
mester was fair game, but when I
actually proposed on January 20,
she had no idea it was coming.”
Huggins asked her out to din-
ner at the Village Tavern, building
itup all week long and meeting her
with a rose when he went to pick
her up. “She really didn’t think I

plied that I didn’t have a ring ear-
lier in the week. In reality I’d had
the ring since Thanksgiving.”

' Having-arrived at the restau-
rant, Molly went to get out of the
car, and Chad asked her where she
was going. He informed Molly
that he wanted his high school ring
back because he’d like to give her
something that fits a little better.
“Needless to say we were really
excited,” he says. “The restaurant
bumped us up in line so we didn’t
have to wait for a table, and the
manager provided us with a bottle
of champagne.”

When asked why he decided
to propose now, Chad says, “Well,
I’d been dying to ask her because I

figured, why hold off? It helps that
we have complimentary interests
since she will be pursuing further
training in health administration
while I will be going into medi-

Chad and Molly will both
graduate this May and planto marry
on August 12.

to Atlanta where Reid is currently
working and arrived a little early.
She was taking a nap when Reid
returned and awakened her.

wanted to know where we were

I’d rather it be a surprise. He then
told me to close my eyes, and when
I was told to open them, he was
holding two plane tickets. He then
told me that he wanted to have a
special dinner in Charleston be-
cause he wanted to marry me. He
got down on his knees and pre-
sented the ring. We then had to
race to the airport in order not to
miss the flight.”

Says Sarah, “To be honest we
have been dating for two anda half
years, and we were both sick of
being apart. I think we can handle
it. The timing just feels right.”
Sarah and Reid are planning a Sep-
tember wedding in Memphis.
