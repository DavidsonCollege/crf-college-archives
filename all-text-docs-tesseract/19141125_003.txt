DR. MARTIN REFURNS.

At a meeting of the student bedy ain
Shearer Hall last Wednesday night the
proposed amendment to the constitution
of student government providing that
the words “or affirm” in brackets be in
serted in the proper place in the oath
required of all members of the student
council, and that the concluding words
of the oath “so help me God” besbrack
ected and made optional, failed to pass.

An amendment to this amendment
was proposed which provided that the
concluding words remain the ‘same but
that the “or affirm” be inserted and that
a clause be inserted requiring every
member af the student council to take
the stronger form of the oath unless he
could show iw valid reason for not wish
ing to dose. “Fhis, which was rejected
as a part of the original measure, was
then proposed as a new amendment, and
is now under consideration for ten days,
as is required by the constitution, Un
less the meering is postponed, the matter
will come up again for final settlement
on next Saturday, November 28.

Dr. Martin has just. returned from
iuite an extensive trip in Georgia and
Florida. He first visited at Moultrie,
Giaa.. where he addressed the Synod.
After his address several business men
came to him and complimented him on
Davidson's good work. “Phe — pastor.
Rev. ‘E. Bo Meacham) (ie). and his
assistant, R. M. Pegram (11), are do-
ing verv cficient work in Moultrie.

Dr. Martin next visited Mr. “Phomas
Watt, at Thomasville. Mr. Will Watt,
Mr. Watt's eldest son, is a trustee of
the college. Sunday was spent at Val
dosta, where he gave two-sermons in the
Presbyterian church, ‘The pastor of this
church is Rev. Mr. Bitzer. From Val
dosta Dr. Martin went to Jacksonville,
Palatka, Deland and Sanford, spending
a.day in cach town. He spent Satur-
dav, Sunday and Monday in “Vampa.
He gave an address in the First Presby-
terian church Sunday morning. From
‘Tampa he returned to the Florida Synod
at Jacksonville. He gave two addresses
before this body, one on our own college
and the other on church work*in general.

Dr. Martin says-thar all the people
are very much interested in| Davidson.
and that they spoke to him especially on
the good success of our foot ball team.

NEW ENGLISH ‘TEXT BOOK.

Dr. M. G. Fulton, Professor of Mng-
lish, has just arranged and edited a new
English text-book entitled “College Life,
Its Conditions and Problems.” He has
compiled and edited this new volume.
which is a collection. of essays by college
presidents and other prominent educat-
ors of the United States and England,
primarily for use in college composition
work and as such it is being used in the
Freshman English course.

As an introductory to each essay he
has given a brief account of the author's
life and chief works, and immediately
following it he has carefully arranged a
number of thought-suggestive topics for
discussion and practice in writing. “The
new text-book differs from his “Exposi-
tory Writing” which was used in the
Freshman English course last year, in
that a majority of the essavs deal with
conditions and problems which relate di-
rectly to college life, which fact brings
the subject nearer to the every-day-life
of the student and adds a new interest
to the course.

KEW BOOKS IN LIBRARY.

The following new books have just
been received in the library: “The Fine
Arts, Brown: The Philosophy _of . the
Beautiful. Knight; Poems Outlines.
Lanier: Outlines of English Literature:
Vol. TI] Landmarks. Memorials and

tion of the Tramp, Kelley; The ‘Teach-
er, Palmer: American-Tapanese — Prob-
lems. Gulick; and Student Standards of
