This Tuesday students will
elect either Bruce Brown or
Lynn Langley as the next
President of the SGA.
Both candidates emphasized

the need for a more efficient
Senate, especially concerning
committee accountability.
Langley pointed out prob:
lems with the Advisory Coun-
cils. ‘“‘They’re under the total

control of the chairman,” she

said. ‘‘We should make sure our

Jackson, Peeples, and Stiefel

Asst. Assignments Editer

Jackson,
Bill Peeples, and John Stiefel
are the candidates for SGA
Vice-President.

Jackson emphasizes that the
Vice-President should become
more active as President of the
Residence Hall Council (RHC),
cooperate more closely with the
Senate, and provide students a
stronger voice in popular issues.

He feels that presiding over
the RHC is ‘‘one of the most
important duties’’ of the Vice-
President.

He would like to continue
present work towards improve-
ment of dorm lounges as well as

the student body.’’ For exam-
ple, he would like to publish the

monthly basis.

to have as large a number as

He added, however, ‘‘It’s
only a difference in degree, not
in kind.”

There are several reasons for
the problem.

One partial cause is errors by
students in registration. Burts
asserted, ‘‘In many cases where
people didn’t get a third course,
it can be traced to errors and
deficiencies.”’

The computer rejects re-

quests that contain an error.

Burts.

Another technical problem
with registration was the failure
of students to make full use of
the options on the registration
form. Burts emphasized that
students should fill out all the
spaces on the registration form
to insure they get three courses.

A third reason was the popu-
larity,of some courses. Burts
said, ‘145 people requested a
course that has a ceiling of 30.”

The most popular courses
were Math 23, Drama 21, Psych
101, Eco 101, History 101 and
102, Religion 163 and 161.

Both candidates will aim to
get student representation on

the Board of Trustees. Brown
will propose one student repre-
sentative to the Board while
Langley put one
student as well as one’ faculty
member on each committee of
the Trustees.

The issue is significant, re-
marked langley, because ‘‘the
Trustees influence the atmos-
phere we have to live under."’

Brown, in speaking of his
qualifications to serve as SGA
President, emphasized the im-
portance of ‘‘real experience.”

In addition to being Vice-
President of the SGA,

has served as a‘senator for two

Brown
vears, as the chairman of vari
ous committees, and as a mem
ber of the Council on Campus
and Religious Life.

“After all the time I’ve put
into the Senate, I'd like to think
that I know how it works,”’ said
Brown.

‘Through my experience I
know how to approach the
faculty and have worked exten-
sively with the Administration.
It’s very important to know
how the Senate functions best,”’
he explained. ,

“Through my work I had to
be efficient. The nature of the
office is organization because of
the bulk of work and the

necessity of clearly seeing prob-
lems and how to step-by-step
solve them,”’ he said.

Brown pointed out the impor-
tance of the President maintain-
ing a ‘‘good.and constant
energy level.’” He explained,
‘In fifteen months as Vice-
President my motivation would
have died if it were going to.
It’s important that I be ener-
getic and motivated throughout
the term and I will be.”’

Brown highlighted many as-
pects of Senate work which he
plans to act upon.

Brown would like to see an
expansion in the number of
courses offered at Davidson.
‘‘The need is very apparent
when over 400 people don't get
three courses. This is an im-
mediate and real need for the
academic community,” he said.

Brown

Brown also seeks to pursue a
change to a merit-based admis
Sions policy. He explained,
The benefit of this system are
obvious: a more qualified fresh-
man class and the elimination of
the social and psychological
problems that an unbalanced
ratio brings.”’

Brown sees a need for David-
son to increase the endowed
scholarship in accordance with
the rise in tuition. He finds it
‘an important responsibility of
the college that less than upper
middle-class students should be

causes problems

“Hundreds of people asked for

these

courses,” claimed Burts
Surts cited afyother cause of
the problem, *‘We’'re offerings
h in the first four period
the day that we're not utiliziny
the full day. There has been a
reluctance by professors to use

afternoon periods.”

He said this was because of
possible conflicts with labs.
“Labs have had control of the
situation. Lab people play the
trump card.’

Several other factors contri-
buted to the course shortage.

Fewer courses are offered this
term because several professors
are absent. Professor oi Classics
George Labbarf, Professor of
Art History Larry Ligo, and
Professor of Spanish Lois Kemp
each took ten students abroad
with them, but they usually
teach many more. Because of

heart trouble, Professor of Psy

Other professors have substi
tuted fall and winter terms for
Davidson Professor of
Religion Gordon Michalson who
has not yet been replaced, but
no one is filling in for him this
term. The only professor com-
ing back from a leave of absence
is Professor of Math Benjamin
Klein.

Another factor is that the
student/faculty ratio has risen
from 11 to 1 to 13 to 1, which is,
according to College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr., a result
of coeducation and the subse-
