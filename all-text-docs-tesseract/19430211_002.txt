>iudents, tacilty, and citizens of the

heartich and long subdued sigh of reliet

than to coneur with Dr. Cunninghain

Traditiondlly, an ambitious junior

fo tne Elections Board:
The basic purpose for for having the

Elections Board is to keep David-
son elections free from politics.

Since: the establishing of this body,

many bad practices have’ been im-
proved, many altogether climinated.
i should like to suggest another re-
iorm that T believe would even fur-
ther help-ecliminate politics.

The biggest —hetp—to~pserde-poli—
ticians in doping out their “slick”
campaighs—from—dty—to—tay during
elections periods comes about when
the election results: for the previous
day are posted. They see that John
Smith _of Rho Dammit and Sam
“Jones of Alpha Sig have . dropped

votes behind the leading man, and

that therefore they need to get the -
Rho Dammit and Alpha Sig votés.

Or Alpha Sig may drop out one day,
and oh the following day a Rho
Dammit gets a big jump in votes,
wherefore they figure how_many_

—__..._ votes_the Alpha Sigs gave the Rho

Dammit, where whose votes will go

the next day, etc., etc. In short, the
only way in which a pseudo-politi-

cian can operate at all-eflectively-is —¥idson man ‘ouglit to be: —

for him to know how many votes-
cach—-man -gets so that he can add
and subtract and figure how many
votes his inan needs, and so forth,—

Accordingly, T’ propose that the
Elections Board.do not post, from
day! to day, the number of votes that:

anyone gets, nor even that men be |

listed according to number of votes,
but rather alphabetically. Thus only -
the names of the men left in .the
race would be posted, and in al-
phabetical order.

For this plan to work at ail, of
course it would be necessary for

Board to keep secret who was get-
ting -how many votes. This letter

is~written-on-the assumption—that—

the Elections Board is really inter-
ested in keeping politics at a mini-
tum. I believe that this plan would

help to do so.
