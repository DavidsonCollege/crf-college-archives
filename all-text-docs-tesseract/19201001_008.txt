tractive title of “A Canary in a Coal
Mine.” He compared the effect of
poison gas ina cual mine to that of
venomous individuals in the social
group, urging the complete eradica-
tion of such disease- producing and
progress- arresting members, As a
means of doing this, and further, as
the only means by which the com-
munity in which we live cau be made
such that we shall nowhere be
ashamed to acknowledge it as our
awn, Dr. Darby advanced complete
co-aperation, the true sire of prog-
ress.

In the evening Dr. Darby spoke
upon “The Making wof an Amer-
ican,” dwelling upon the form of our
government, the basis of American- 7
ism, differentiating between true
jand quasi-Americanism, and insist.

Due to the unusually hot weather,

lightening information, Professor
Flue proved to be a master of his
subject. Most of the people of
whom he spoke were more or less
exotic in their customs, However,
he showed us clearly that they were
just “plain folks like you and me.”
While Mr. Flue was introducing
the Kraft trio, talented musicians,
Dr. Arbuckle arose and made a few
remarks on this and the next Chau-

pre miinent citizens.

Good music was next given by the
Kraft trie, and after this the pro-
gram was brought to an end. They
rendered several selections of popu-
lar songs and recitations,
were well received. Mr. Kraft and
his clarinet were especially appre-
ciated.

The “Star-Spangled Ranner” and
“O Davidson” were used as a fitting
close.

MESSAGE TO STUDENTS

of Hangchow there are five self-sup-
porting native churches, and in four
of these are pastors who have re-
ceived their training at Hangchow |
Christian College. This is some of
the part the college is taking in
meeting Ws opportunities.”

“Yet. it is net to the past, but to
the future that we are looking in
China,” .said Mr. Wilson. ‘The Chi-
nese love and respect education as —
probably no other people. Their
minds are open to, and their hearts
appreciate America’s efforts to help
them. Yet here at Hangchow is the

ponly college in a province of over

17 million people. Moreover, in the
pest, the Northern Presbyterian
Church has borne almost four-fifths

‘of the expense and work of this col-
Hege.

The opportunity lies now be-
fore the Southern Presbyterian
Church, it must awake and meet this
opportunity, or else God will have to
try again through some other
agent.”
