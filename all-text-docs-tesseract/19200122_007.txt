F, STUDENT.

For age and history, punting and
athletics, in the opinion of one of. the
American officers who attended lectures
there, Oxford University deserves un-
usual consideration. ‘There were some
two thousand men who were given an
opportunity to atter.d the British Uni-
versities in the spring term of 1919, and
Oxford received a quota. The whole
idea was, in a way, a matter of propa-
ganda, “Propaganda rules the world
nowadays, thev say.” as one of the stu-
dents, Lieut. Robert L, Wolf, C.A.. re-
marks. “but some forms of it are
pleasanter to take than others.  Cer-
tainly no protest was ever more success-
ful and agreeable than that which aim-
ed to increase the cordiality of Anglo-
American sentiment bv sending two
thousand members of the A. E. F. to
study at British Universicies.” Regard-
ing Oxford University, Lieut. John R.
Dyer, of the Coast Artillery, writes in
Liaison (Fortress Monroe, Va.).

The detachment arrived in England
the first week in March, and after two
weeks’ delay was assigned in grougs of
three to three hundred among the vari-
ous universities, Almost all the students
were given their first or second choice
of universities. 1. fortunately, drew
mv first choice and went to Oxford.
There were several other Coast Artil-
lery officers and men at the same school.

Oxford University is prouder of its
history and age than of anv other item.
Many of its buildings are old and
weather-beaten, and would not be con-
sidered a credit to the average American
campus, but To can only faintly imagine
the scornful indignation with which the
offer of an American millionaire to re-
place them with up-to-date buildings
would be reiected. Despite their build-
ings and their antiquity, or perhaps be-
cause of them, the school is progressive
and keenly awake to the great problems
of the day, such as history, both ancient
and modern. ‘Vheir work appeaied to
many of the students present. - One
series of lectures of especial value was
given by Prof. Grant Robertson upon
the problems of the Peace Conference.
Every British and American officer who
had time to do so attended these lectures
and followed the problems that were
puzzling the Paris statesmen at that
particular time. “Phe men participated
in the athletic life of the community,
and American students rowed on col-
leg crews, plaved on tennis teams, and
even attempted the mysteries of cricket.
Vhe particular American contribution
to the athletic life at Oxford was in the
formation of a baseball team. Cam-
bridge had a team also. and altho these
two universieies have been fighting cach
other some six hundred years in the
eridiron they met for the firs: time this
spring on the diamond. The British
enjoyed the sport, but | have no doubt
that they will still stick to their con-
servative game of cricket, leaving the
wild shouting of baseball for their less
civilized brothers in this side of the At-
nantic.

One of the characteristics of the
Britisher is his slowness to enthuse. At
a cricket game the average Brifsher
will sit quietly on a bench some distance
from the Scene of operations probably
with a pipe in his mouth. For a half
an hour he may say nothing, but at an
unusually brilliant play he is likely to
remove his pipe, turn apologetically to
his neighbor and say. “Ah! Jolly good!”
and then put the pipe back in his mouth
for another half an hour of quiet.

The thing that most imprest them
at the baseball games was the rooting
of the crowd, and, despite the technical
nature of baseball, the usual question
asked of the American bystander was
an excited, “What did he say?”

The British were exceptionally gen-
erous in their hospitality; almost with-
out exception their homes were open to
the Americans, and the invitations were
largely accepted there with no clique or
clannishness among the Americans—
they all tried to spend the maximum
amount of time with their British fel-
low students and the families in and
near Oxford.

Tho the War Department never said
so, many of us are inclined to think that
the entire scheme was a very intelligent

country, have come home warm ad-

mirers of a really great people whom work.

HOME DIETETICS

'

“Nourish your body thoughtfully,
And it will sustain your thoughts.”
Milk. eggs and the feafy vegetables
have been called the “protective foods.”
“In the city of B-——.” writes Dr.
E. V. McCullom, of Johns Hopkins

Hespital, “we have had no less than

seven institutions for the care of
homeless — children. One of — these

last February had not had a death in
sever. years. Still another had had no
death in 1917. At the other extreme
stood one institution ins which 23. per
cent of the inmates had died in’ the
past vear. Upon investigagtion of the
children’s diet here. 1 found the pur-

chase's of the three protective foods al-

most nil,

Do you realize why these foods are
of such importance? Do you know the
value of preen vegetables, of cereals
and eges as a substitute for expensive
meats? In the days of our forefathers
meat wa's the most readily procured
food. The raising of vegetables re-
quired the clearing of ground and. its
culture under hard and sometimes
dangerous conditions, since many a
pioneer at work in his field, was killed
by tomahawk or arrow from an unseen
foe. ‘These conditions led the carly
settlers to depend largely on meat, and
thus the habit was formed for their de-
scendents,

But now our mode of life, and par-
ticularly the cost of meat makes it
much less of a good bargain. A house-
wife with a family of five to feed, says
Lusk, should buy three quarts of milk
before buving a pound of mear. even
though the prices of both have leaped
skyward.

Intelligent cating is now recognized

as one of the chief factors in pro-
moring health and efficiency, | “Fhe
Red Cross offers a course in home

dietetics which aims to give every girl
and woman in. the United States ele-
mentary instruction in proper nutrition
for the well and ‘sick. Instead of using
a.text book, outlines will be prepared at
national headquarters in’ co-opera»
tion with the Department of Agricul-
ture, to puide instructors in) presenting
the course. ‘These outlines will include
a lecture to be given by the teacher,
topics for discussion by the class, with
suggested laboratory work wheruver
possible; home work, exhibits, demon-
strations, contests, etc.; extensive ref-
erences, bibliographies, and illustrative
material, Instruction will be given by
Red Cross dietitians, or by qualified
laywomen under — their supervision.
Particular emphasis will be placed on
the every-day problems in the home.

"Phe meals which should) be. offered
to a family of adults who are engaued
in sedentary work at an office differ
greatly from those suited to a house-
hald of farmers. The aim of this course
will he to make flexible enough to ap-
ply to every type of family.

“Aside from the question of physio-
logical need, cating has an immense
vogue as an amusement.” Do you
realize chat what you give your husband
and your children for breakfast, lunch-
con and dinner constitutes in large part
the measure, not only of their strength,
and their accomplishment. but also of
their dispositions during the day, and
also during their lives? Who knows
how far carcfully-balanced, econamical-
ly selected.- properly cooked,- daintily
served, and casily-digested meals might
go to keep the doctor, the wolf, and
even the divorce lawyer from your
door? Won't you let the Red Cross,
through its course in home dietetices.
help you to find out?—Red Cross Bul-
