Wildcat Game of
the Week

Saturday at 7:00 p.m.
Football vs. Lenoir-Rhyne

Behind the impressive performances of
cornerback Patrick Fitzgerald ’08,
Jonathon Hubbard 707, and QB Ryan
Alexander ’08, football looked solid
against GC. Now comes the next test.
The ’Cats will be looking for an encore
presentation against a team that beat
them last year 26-3.

Tennessee at Florida

Perhaps I should mix it up a little and
pick a baseball game, but Tennessee-
Florida is yet another match-up between
top-ten teams which promises to extend
an already exciting rivalry. After our
own game versus Lenoir-Rhyne, my
advice would be to find a TV and catch
at least part of this one. My pick, of
course, as a FSU fan is Tennessee.

I’ve previously stated that I don’t care
when professional athletes act like idiots. Let
me amend that: I don’t care when they act
like idiots and don’t mess with my team’s
record. This isn’t the NHL, Jeremiah Trotter,
and you should be ashamed of yourself.

It’s because of you that I will be getting
that hour-long call from my _ brother,

bemoaning his Eagles, cursing the NFC, and

praising Andy Reid for his ridiculously
opportune time out in the fourth quarter of
Monday’s upset. The time out that couldn’t
save Philadelphia from itself.

Even David Akers, who is 82.4 percent in
his career, went one for three.

At least it’s only Week One.

To explain my frustation to those who may
have not witnessed the pain and suffering
that was Monday Night Football this week,
two players, Jeremiah Trotter for the Eagles
and Kevin Mathis for the Falcons, had some
pre-game fisticuffs that ended in ejection
from the game. Trotter’s absence from his
starting middle linebacker position cost the
Eagles the win; Mathis’ absence couldn’t
have meant less.

According to’ Trotter, “[Mathis] threw a
punch first. When he threw a punch, I tried to
defend myself. I tried to grab his facemask. I
did get ahold of it. I guess the ref thought

Ice-T has told us, “Don’t hate the player,
hate the game.” If you watched any of the
2005 U.S. Open, you probably no longer
hate the game of tennis.

And there’s no way you hate the player,
Andre Agassi. In fact, you probably love
him. But if not, maybe you will after
reading this.

Many in the United States were
frustrated with tennis when Andy
Roddick got bounced in stunning
fashion from the U.S. Open in the
first round—they must have thought
35-year olds are too old to play ten-
nis.

Andre Agassi’s stunning ride to
last Sunday’s U.S. Open final proved
otherwise.

Agassi delighted the New York
City faithful by winning six grueling
matches before bowing out in the
championship to Roger Federer, the

Federer is already considered one of
the best—if not the best—player in
the history of the sport. His record
this year is an incomprehensible 71-
3.

Last week, the Swiss star lost only
three sets en route to his second U.S.
Open title. One of those was to the
Ageless Wonder himself.

Last Sunday, Agassi took the sec-
ond set from Federer 6-2, before
going down in four sets 6-3, 2-6, 7-6,
6-1.

On his way to the finals, Agassi
beat players of ages 28, 26, 20, 26,
25, and 24. To those removed from
the tennis world, the difference between
those ages and Agassi’s 35 probably does not
seem too significant. a

Consider, however, these statistics: Agassi
is the oldest U.S. Open finalist since Ken

- Rosewall appeared in the 1974 title match at

the age of 40.
The oldest player—other than Agassi—in
the top 10 of the current ATP Tour rankings

is 26.

that was a punch. He tossed us both.”

Oh, so you were just trying to defend
yourself. Sure. And the fact that the Eagles
danced on the Falcons’ image in the center of
the field a few minutes later, causing another
semi-fight, that was just self-defense too.

What began as trash-talking escalated into
a wild, pumped up, sold out audience taunt-
ing Donovan McNabb and his offense. You
wouldn’t believe how loud that stadium can

Agassi is the oldest player in the top 100,
and he’s at number six.

Have I even mentioned that he had to go
five sets in three consecutive matches with
those young guys? What Agassi did last
week would be the equivalent of Julio
Franco, the 46-year old Atlanta Braves’ first
baseman, winning MVP of the 2010 NLCS.

Agassi nearly pulled off the improbable last week.

The tennis legend’s run last week was
prgof enough to dismiss the other mistaken
idea that U.S. tennis is nothing without
Roddick.

As if to further scoff at such a notion, how-
ever, Agassi and fellow American James
Blake played one of the best matches the
U.S. Open has ever seen in the quarterfinals.
Blake, 10 years Agassi’s younger, led by two

get, and after a few false starts, you could see
that the atmosphere got to the Eagles.

I don’t know who said mental toughness
was 90 percent of the game, but he was
awfully wise.

The loss was especially painful if you con-

sider that Philly is from the weak NFC, who
only contributed one Superbowl champion in
five years.
* Said Trotter, “It was the first time I was
ever in a situation like this. It was tough,
being in the locker room, not being able to
go out there and make some plays, to try and
help my team.”

Stop, I’m about to cry. Putting aside
Trotter’s eloquence for a moment, I’m glad
he felt that way. I hope that he regrets what-
ever trash he talked about Mathis’ mother
that caused the fight. _

Michael Vick totaled 224 yards, almost
100 more than in the teams’ last matchup. He
ran for a touchdown. He got his revenge,
while McNabb and Terrell Owens couldn’t
pull off a TD. They may have come together
for 112 yards, but as Warrick Dunn said after
the game:

“The main thing is to win.”

If Philadelphia can start playing as a team
(read: TO, Trotter), then they definitely have
the ability to make another Super Bowl
appearance, and I won’t have to talk any
members of my family down from that slip-
pery ledge of Philly-fan-self-hate.

sets and had broken serve in the third when
Agassi began a miracle comeback.

Agassi won the next two sets, and then
stared defeat in the face once more when
Blake served for the match at 5-4 in the fifth
set. But the wily veteran broke and eventual-
ly triumphed in a thrilling tiebreaker.

Final score: the old American over his
young compatriot 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (8-

6).

After Agassi’s dream run finally
came to an end two matches later,
he was inevitably asked the same
question that he has been asked
after practically every tournament
since the start century: what next?

He said, “I’m unsure about what
I’m going to do in a month, let
alone a year from now. But as of
now, my intention is to keep work-
ing and keep doing what I do.”

But what does “doing what I do”
mean? As much as Agassi does on
the tennis court, he has done even
greater things away from the
game.

In 1994, he founded the Andre
Agassi Charitable Foundation in
his hometown of Las Vegas.
Dedicated to improving the lives
of children, the foundation has
raised more than $36 million for a
variety of projects such as summer
camps and a Boys and Girls Club.

In 1997, Agassi opened his own
school, known as Agassi Prep.

Located in one of the most eco-

' nomically-depressed and crime-
ridden areas of Las Vegas, Agassi

Prep is funded completely by the

Agassi Foundation. Tuition is free

for 300 lucky students selected by
a lottery.

Says Agassi: “I have been very blessed
and have had many opportunities available
to me. Children today face so many obsta-
cles. If I can make a positive impact on at
least one child’s life, then it has all been
worthwhile.”

You do not have to like tennis to appreci-
ate that.
