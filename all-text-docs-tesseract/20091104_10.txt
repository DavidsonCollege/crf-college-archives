Wildcats earn accolades at SoCon Championships

The Davidson Wildcats men’s cross
country team completed their 2009 season
with a great finish at the Southern Confer-
ence Championship. The 8k race was held on
the grassy trails of the Elon University Intra-
mural Fields in Greensboro, N.C.

The meet consisted of Davidson and the
other ten teams in the Southern Conference.
The Wildcats finished in 2nd place with a
score of 82 points, 38 points behind the vic-
torious team from Appalachian State Univer-
sity.

Even though the Wildcats were ranked
higher in the polls coming into the champi-
onship meet, Appalachian State was domi-
nant, winning their 5th consecutive Southern
Conference Championship.

“Tt wasn’t quite what we wanted, but our
top guys competed very well today,” head
coach Gary Andrew said. “We’ll certainly
build off this performance when we return to
Louisville for regionals.”

Even with these high expectations,
Coach Andrew must have been proud seeing
his team finish the best-ever for the David-
son men’s cross country team at the SoCon
Championship. The Wildcats had previously
finished no higher than third, last doing so in
1955. The other top-5 team finishers behind

ASU were the following: University of North
Carolina-Greensboro (83 points), University
of Tennessee-Chattanooga (109 points), and
Elon University (134 points).

The Wildcats were led by Lance Harden
710 and Ryan Hopkins ’12, who earned Ist
Team All-Conference honors with their 3rd
place and 8th place finishes, respectively.
Harden ran the race in 25:05 and Hopkins
followed him in 25:32.

Following Harden and Hopkins, were:
Tom Divinnie °10 (15th/ 25:50), Charlie
Schmitt ’11 (26th/ 26:27), Demetrios Pago-
nis 713 (30th/ 26:32), Peter Bruton ’10 (34th/
26:42), Thad Sieracki ’12 (55th/ 27:26), Greg
Marcil ’11 (S6th/ 27:26) and Ian Tupper °*12
(63rd/ 27:40). There were a total of 87 run-
ners who participated in this year’s Southern
Conference Championship. The Wildcats
will return to action on November 14th when
they compete in the NCAA Southeast Region
Championships in Louisville, Ky.

The Davidson Wildcats women’s cross
country team also traveled to Elon Universi-
ty for the 2009 Southern Conference Cham-
pionships. The Wildcats finished in 5th place
overall, but in doing so had three All-South-
ern Conference performers.

“TI am very proud of how we ran up front
today, being the only team to finish with
three All-Conference runners,” head coach
Jen Straub said. “I think we have a lot to be

proud of and a lot to build on in the future!”

One of those pieces to build on, Natalie
Atabek ’13, finished 9th overall with a time
of 18:58. With her impressive performances
this season, Atabek also garnered All-Fresh-
man honors.

The Wildcats other two All-Conference
runners were Danielle Ruggieri *11 and
Heather Connaroe °11 who finished 12th
place and 14th place respectively. This race
was against the other eleven teams that make
up the SoCon, so to finish 5th out of 12 teams
was solid.

Other top finishers for the Wildcats were:
Lauren Childs ’11 (36th/ 19:33), Jane Gay
712 (39th/ 19:37), Sarah Cline *11 (47th/
19:51), Anna Stockamore ’12 (54th/ 20:02),
Elizabeth Wilbur ’13 (55th/ 20:04) and Caro-
line Gecker ’13 (69th/ 20:36).

There were a total of 100 women who
ran in the event. The top-5 team finishers in
the field included the following: Samford
University (74 points), Elon University (75
points), Appalachian State University (83
points), Furman University (93 points) and
Davidson College (110 points). The individ-
ual title went to Appalachian State freshman
Brittney Caudle who ran the race in 17:47.
The Wildcats will hope to build on their im-
pressive showing when they head to Louis-
ville, Ky on November 14 for regionals.

Swimming and diving teams split weekend meets

The ’Cats had a double header this
weekend, starting with a dual meet Friday
afternoon against the Tribe of the College
of William and Mary. Both the men’s and
women’s teams fell short of a win, losing
131-87 and 149-90, respectively.

Individual winners for the men’s team in-
cluded Geoffrey Peitz ’12 and Drew Onken
°13. Peitz took the 200 IM and 200 fiy while
Onken continued his first year domination
with 2 wins in the 200 back and breast.
Bryan Droll ’11 also was an individual win-
ner, claiming the 50 yard freestyle in a time
of 21.96 seconds, swimming his way to his
first dual meet victory.

For the women, Emily Castle ’11 made
her career debut in the 200 yard fly. In her
first attempt, Castle dominated the field,
winning the race in a near school record
time of 2:08.13.

On the diving board, Kelsey Chisholm
”10 took home first in the 1 meter competi-
tion while teammate Linnea Buttermore ’10
claimed the 3 meter.

Davidson continued their weekend of
competition with an away meet Saturday
in Charleston, SC. The Wildcat Women
snagged their first season victory as they

won the rival cat fight against the Cougars,
151-89. On the women’s side, head coach
John Young purposefully “challenged the
team to demonstrate some versatility”.

The Davidson men’s team nearly over-
took the College of Charleston squad, los-
ing by only 12 points (124-112). Swimming
their off events, the Wildcat women still
swam an impressive meet. Lindsey Martin
711 swapped her standard sprint repertoire
for a taste of the distance races. Martin dom-
inated (per usual), claiming the 200 and 400
freestyles. Jessica Delgehausen *11 swam
her way to victory in the 100 free while
Castle took the 50. Lauren Kamperman 12
made her debut in the 200 back, winning
with a time of 2:29.67. On the board, But-
termore and Chisholm took the 1 meter and
3 meter competitions.

For the men’s team, Onken won another
pair of events, dominating both the 200 fly
and breast. Curtis Chaney 712, Droll, and
Peitz all were individual winners, taking
the 200 free, 50 free, and 200 back, respec-
tively.

The Wildcats return to competition this
Saturday with a decision against NC State.
Come cheer on the ’Cats as they take on the
Wildcats this Saturday, noon, at Cannon na-
tatorium.

Cats’ SoCon Tourney
hopes end with loss at
UNC-Greensboro

ZACHARY ZIMMERMAN
Staff Writer

Despite the amazing season and stellar
play of Davidson men’s soccer this year,
the team fell short when they dropped two
games back to back. After losing to No. 2
Wake Forest on Tuesday night and UNC-
Greensboro on Saturday, Davidson is effec-
tively tied for fourth place in the SoCon. Un-
fortunately, their head to head tie with Elon
puts them out of the playoffs, where only the
top four teams in the SoCon compete. On
a positive note, Charlie Reiter ’10 has been
named to the Academic All-American Team
for District 3.

Davidson fell by a score of 4-1 to Wake
Forest University in Winston Salem, N.C. on
last Tuesday night. Davidson posted its only
goal with 18 minutes left in the match when
Alex Caskey ’11 scored off a free kick from
25 yards out, putting it inside the top left cor-
ner of the goal. Chip Sanders 12 made nine
saves on the night but it was not enough for
Davidson.

Saturday night, things did not improve.
Defensive pressure on both sides character-
ized the first half as UNC-Greensboro and
Davidson went into the half scoreless. Not
until the 13:59 mark in the second half did e1-
ther team muster a goal, when UNC-Greens-
boro scored to take a 1-0 lead. Less than a
minute later, Davidson answered when Josh
Zipin ’11 chipped in a cross from Mark Mil-
lard 12 to even things up at 1-1. Failing to
convert on many scoring opportunities, Da-
vidson fell after UNC Greensboro added two
more goals to the total on the night to take
the match 3-1. Davidson’s record declined to
10-7-0 overall and 3-4-0 in the SoCon.

Davidson faced off in their final match
on the season on Tuesday night at Campbell
University, winning by a score of 5-2. The
Davidson offense performed well in their last
game, and hopes to carry that success into
next season.
