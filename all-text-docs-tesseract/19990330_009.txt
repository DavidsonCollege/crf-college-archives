THE DAVIDSONIAN

Wanted: Outspoken, outstanding advisors

By Jenny Hapcoop
Student Health Advisor

Maybe you saw the Butts for Bagels poster in
Chambers, maybe you reached into our purple
punch bowl of contraception, or maybe you lis-
tened to us discuss the dangers of drunken hook-
ups. If you found yourself interested in, or excited
by, any of these events, we may have a job for you!

Springtime again, and with the new season,
comes a new challenge for Georgia Ringle,
Davidson’s revered and loved health educator.
During the months of March and April, Georgia
will be hunting for her 1999-2000 health advisors.
Four students will be selected to work closely with
Georgia and the Student Health Center during
both-semesters of the next school year.

So, what does a health advisor do? As spokes
persons for Georgia, health advisors teach fresh-
men hall programs and some segments of PE 101.
The hall programs range from awareness of STD’s
and need for contraception to a discussion of the
varying proofs that different alcohols carry. Addi-
tionally, health advisors design posters and bulle-
tin boards seen in Chambers and residence halls.
This year, we co-organized the AIDS Awareness
Day luminaries that lit up the night sky around
Chambers, the Union, and the Library. Organiz-
ing Butts for Bagels and the Health Fair are great

activities that require enthusiasm and a desire to
get this campus thinking and motivated.

Here’s a fair warning to those who are inter-
ested in applying: This job is not for the faint-
hearted! You must be willing to discuss SEX and
DRINKING and other HEALTH ISSUES AT
DAVIDSON COLLEGE. Yes, it’s true. David-
son College does have its own set of problems; we
have students with STD’s, excessive stress, un-
planned pregnancies, alcoholism, eating disor-
ders, and drunk driving. While we do focus on
health concerns, health advisors are privileged to
more than reporting facts. Think about it: you get
your own trash bag of condoms! Who wouldn’t
want to be a health advisor?

The bottom line is this: a health advisor is one
who does more than talk about the problems and
wish things were better. To be a health advisor,
you must acknowledge that Davidson College is
NOT ina bubble; we have issues that can be solved
with the help of ambitious and compassionate
students. If you’re interested in joining Georgia
and the health educators, please pick up an appli-
cation at the Student Health Center or call Georgia
Ringle for further details. If you have questions
about the health advisors’ perspectives on the job,
feel free to obtain their numbers from Georgia.
Thanks and don’t let this opportunity to make an
impact pass you by.

Davidson Dance Troupe cel-
ebrates tenth anniversary with
‘The Beauty of the Woman”

By Setu Davis
Arts & Living Editor

This past Saturday, March 26, 1999, the
Davidson Dance Troupe (and a few friends) put on
a show entitled “The Beauty of Woman.” Set in
Hodson Hall, “The Beauty of Woman” not only
showcased the talents of the ten member dance
troupe but also the talents of various female fac-
ulty members and other students. The Davidson
Dance Troupe has been existent for the past ten
years—this ten year anniversary finds a program
devoted not only to performance, but also to teach-
ing the art that is dance.

Saturday’s performance employed the tal-
ents of Carey Arvin, Kate Bedinger, Laura Crim,
Candice Hall, Amanda Lanier, Julia Philpott, Emily
Snyder, Kristen Taylor, Laura Taylor, and Brooke
Weihe, The Dance Troupe is composed of these
ten students. Kate Scibal was the one additional
dancer in the performance. Poems were read by
Elizabeth Mills, Magdalena Maiz-Pena, Ann Culp
and Elizabeth Malphurs, and Ashley A. King.

The performance opened with a dance cho-
reographed by Dance Troupe member Julia
Philpott. The dance, entitled “Mercurial,” was
performed to the music of Tori Amos. The dancers
were Kate Bedinger, Laura Crim, Julia Philpott,
and Emily Snyder. “The Beauty of Woman”
opened with a strong and emotionally evocative
performance. The first dance was followed by
Kristen Taylor’ s reading of apoem entitled “Hips”.

Elizabeth Mills followed with a reading of a
poem entitled “Lady in Red”. The interspersion of
dance and poetry was an interesting and compel-
ling part of Saturday night’s concert. After the
first poetry reading of the night, Kristen Taylor
and Laura Taylor danced to the music of Ma-
donna. Their dance was followed by another
poetry reading. Ann Culp and Elizabeth Malphurs
alternated reading lines froma poem entitled “Step-
ping Westward”. Kristen Taylor followed with a
dance done to Shawn Mullins’ song “Shimmer”.

Intermission followed Kristen’ s performance.
Once the audience was reseated, the most interest-

ing combination of poetry and dancing came in the
performance entitled “BodySpeakArt.” In this
performance the dancing of Kristen Taylor and
Laura Taylor was combined with dancing and a
monologue performed by Amanda Lanier. Set to
the music of Deep Forest, the powerful delivery of
the monologue and the interpretive dancing by
Laura and Kristen made for a compelling perfor-
mance,

Poetry again took hold of the show after
BodySpeakArt. Magdalena Maiz-Pena recited La
Unica Mujer, reading line by line in Spanish and
English. Maiz-Pena read with enthusiasm and
feeling, really bringing the verse to life through the
power of her voice and expression. She was
followed by another dance performance, this one
entitled “Great Gig in the Sky,” in which Laura
Taylor danced to music by Pink Floyd. Her
performance was a true example of interpretive,
artistic dance that brought music into the realm of
movement. Her movements seemed filled not
only with artistry but also with a sense of joyful
spirit.

Ashley A. King then read a poem of her own.
Her poem was a strong piece, set in accessible
language that brought the poem’s situation into
reality. Set in free verse, her poem could have
truly been a telephone conversation. Ashley’s
poetry reading was followed by Amanda Lanier
and Kate Scibal’s dance entitled “What You Don’t
Know’”--a humoruous song combined with dance.
Their dance moved into the final poetry reading of
the night, this one by Elizabeth Mills. She read the
poem entitled “Plant”, which was about a breakup
but also about the workings of a woman’s mind.

The final dance piece of the night was done
by the entire dance troupe. It was entitled Woman
witha Blue Veil. Choreographed by Julia Philpott,
and using the music of Nine Inch Nails, Black
Sabbath, and Bjork, this dance was a fitting end to
the night’s performance. The show “The Beauty
ofthe Woman” combined different view on women

expressed in dance and in poetry. This combina- .

tion became a thematic whole that certainly shows
the creative side and talent of the women here at
Davidson College.
