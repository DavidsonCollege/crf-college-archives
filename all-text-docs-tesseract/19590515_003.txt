Retire I-F Sports Cup

The Phi Delts have retired the interfraternity athletic trophy, presented to

, that fraternity whose teams accumulate the greatest number of points in intramural
competition. The cup has been won for three consecutive years by the Phi Delts, who
thereby earn the right to keep it.

Throughout the year, they
found themselves in a tight
scrap with the Betas and the
Kappa Sigs, who finished two-
three in the overall race..

to the scene early, as the
greenies took the flickerball

and Phi Delts. The wrestling
tournament again found the
. Kappa Snappers supreme,
with the KA’s, Betas and Phi
Delts on their heels.

Phi Delt strength showed in
the swimming meet. as the boys
of blue and white stepped onto
the tank throne for the third
successive year, far outdistanc-
ing their closest rivals.

Perhaps the best balanced
competition of the year was
found in the basketball leaguc.
The SAE’s, Phi Gams, and Phi
Delts finished in a three-way
tie for the title as they knocked
one another off.

KA handbailers Dee Green
and John Heath West coast-
ed to @ 120 record, trailed

by ATO’s Roy Gilbert and
Richard Brubaker, to compile
the only perfect winning
mark of the year.

A Phi Delt victory in the
track meet shoved them into
a lead of over a hundred
points as the Greeks raced
down the spring sports
stretch. The Betas finished a
strong second fo stay with-
in reaching distance.

An 11-1. mark in volleyball
won for the Kappa Sigs another
championship. They finished a
game ahead of the Betas, who
held a similar lead over the
KA's and ATO’s. The Phi Delt
margin was now narrowed to
70 points,

A strong finish by the Phi
Delts in softball gave them
mathematical assurance of re-
tiring the trophy. Final stand-
ings found them a game be-
hind the winning Betas,
whom they defeated in the
season opener for the lone
blemish on the 11-1 Beta
slate.

With several matches yet to

be played in the doubles divi-
sion, the tennis tournament
shapes up as a battle between

(34), William and Mary (30),
Virginia Tech (214%), Davidson
