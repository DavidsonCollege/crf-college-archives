Forum tries to bridge
communication gap

By LYMAN COLLINS
Staff Writer

“One of the major problems
on campus is that students
rarely, if ever, get together in
one group. There is a real lack
of communication on
campus,” said Roger Brown,
newly elected chairman of the
Inter-Organizational Forum.

The Forum sets out to bring
together many campus organ-
izations including Patterson
Court Council, SGA Senate,
Black Student Coalition, the
Union Board, The Davidso-
nian, WDAV, and _ the
YM/YWCA.

“This group was established
to provide better means of
communication and organiza-
tion among the students on
campus. It was set up not to
be an action group because we
don’t have any powers, but we
can be a pressure group.

“We're really more or less a
group to bring about action or
recommend action,’’ said
Brown.

One of the Forums most
obvious accomplishments so
far this year was the coordi-
nation of homecoming plan-
ning between Patterson Court
Council and the College Union
Board.

Another matter brought be-
fore the forum recently was
student elections. Elections
here have been notoriously
low-keyed, with poor voter
turn out. Often the candidates
don't know what they are
getting into. The Forum has
arranged with The David-
sonian to run profiles on the
various candidates providing
their views as well as a
photograph of each candidate.

The SGA Senate suspended
its By-Laws, moving back
election filing dates to make
this technically possible.

WDAV has also been en-
couraged to interview them on
the air. Hereafter, the candi-
dates will gather before the
election to learn exactly what
the office entails.

“The biggest thing,
though,’ observed Brown, “‘is
having The Davidsonian give
publicity to everyone who
runs. That has already. been
agreed upon.” |

Plans are now under way to
discuss student evaluation of
professors. ‘‘There has. been a
lot of complaints about SIR
(Student Instructional Re-
port) forms as they stand
now,’’ said Brown. These
forms are filled out at exams
to evaluated professors.

The Union’s proposed new
Video-Beam Projector is also

‘slated to come under discus-

sion.

The Forum, brain child of
Karl Goodhouse, was formed
last year. ‘‘Karl talked to me
and several others and we all
thought it was a good idea,”’
recalled Brown.

Goodhouse recently re-
signed as chairman, mainly
because of a lack of time. After
a reorganizational meeting,
Brown was chosen to succeed
him. ‘‘Everyone has, a pretty
good spirit, about it. Everyone
feels like it’s useful,’’ said
Brown.

‘The thing we need now
most of all is acceptance by
the students and the organi-
zations we represent and just a
bit more time to discover what
kind of influence we’re going
to have,”’ Brown said.

Bond, Crawford challenge
extended studies ruling

By BILL BARNES
Copy Editor

The full faculty will review
at its next meeting a decision
made by the Curriculum and
Executive Committees. The
decision concerns whether an
Extended Studies project may
be used to fulfill an area
requirement for graduation.

So far, the Cu¥riculum and
Executive Committees have
refused to allow an Extended
Study done by seniors Bill
Bond and Rory Crawford to
fulfill area requirement.

Course content

Bond and Crawford feel that
this judgement was made, not
out of a consideration of the
content of the course, but on
its name. Originally concieved
as an Independent Study, the
two seniors’ work in computer
programming under Dr. Jerry
A. Roberts was labeled Ex-
tended Studies will not qualify
as an area requirement
course said Registrar Rich-
ard Clyde Burts, Jr. ‘“‘It
was concieved as a program to
be undertaken above and be-
yond course requirements, and

we cannot give area require-
ment credits for it.”’

Bond and Crawford main-
tain, with Director of Ex-
tended Studies Hansford M.
Epes, Jr., that this case
presents certain extenuating
circumstances which warrant
its review.

Physics 23

Among these are their ex-
clusion, first through lack of
places and later through a new
policy which bars seniors from
taking it, from Physics 23,
and the fact that nowhere
within student grasp does the
hard-and-fast ruling that Ex-
tended Studies may not count
towards area requirement ful-
fillment exist. According to
both Burts and Epes, the
ruling exists in the faculty
minutes only.

Both seniors and Epes find
this a failing. It is not stated
in the students’ contract with
the college, the catalogue
under which Bond and Craw-
ford entered, nor in the pre-

sent one that an Extended:

Study cannot be used as an

area requirement course.
course.

Bond and Crawford ques-
tion whether ‘‘students are to
be held to rules and decisions
written in records not open to

them,’ and question what a
student’s contract with the
College actually consists of.

Were the course name
changed from Extended Study
to Independent Study, as-
signed a number, or otherwise
declared an official part of the
curriculum, it would be al-
lowed to stand. It is this that
makes the seniors feel they
have been judged solely on the
“Catch-22” that the name of
their project was Extended
Studies.

Burts holds that the Regis-
trar’s Office ‘‘cannot accept
Extended Studies. It would
start a flood of requests, which
we already have too many of.
We've told, say, 300 students
this couldn’t be done. The
difference is that these two
aren’t satisfied.’’

“T have no control over the
decision of the full faculty,”’ he
continued, ‘‘BUT I expect
their conclusion will reflect
those already made. I don’t
expect any surprises.”
