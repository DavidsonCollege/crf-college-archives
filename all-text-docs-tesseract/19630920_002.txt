THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1963

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

Of Minds And Computers

In a recent interview with Rob-
ert Conn of the Charlotte Observer
Fred Anderson. Marshall Scholar from
the University of North Carolina, ex-
pressed the view that a study of math-
ematics, rather than the humanities,
produces the most well-rounded in-
dividual.

“If ] were starting my college
work again.” he said. “I would major
in mathematics. Almost every field of
knowledge is contained in higher
math. A major in any one of the hu-
manities. in my mind, tends to de-
velop a narrower individual than one
in such an’ all-encompassing field as
math.”

With no more available than
these few sentences, .it is difficult to

trace the line of reasoning which leads-

Anderson to this unqualified conclu-
sion. But taken at face value, his
opinion places too much confidence in
higher mathematics and not nearly
enough in the liberal arts.

Unquestionably, as it expands in
scope, higher mathematics is becom-
ing a more important and useful tool
in the areas of scientific discovery.
Indeed, it has been said that the
ultimate aim of the modern scientist,
be he a physicist or biologist or what-
ever, is to reduce his speciality to the
science of mechanics, thence to mathe-
matical formulae and symbols capable
of being programmed for use on com-
puters.

But to apply this line of reasoning
to all disciplines is to ignore some
basic differences between the sciences
and the liberal arts. For example, most
modern philosophers and theologians
would hesitate to reduce all their ut-
terances to IBM cards. Likewise, it
would be difficult, if not utterly im-
possible. to compare the sonnets of
Shakespeare with those of Browning,
or to express the emotional impact of

Underachievement

The principal argument we have
heard against the school’s new policy
on underachievement concerns the
right of an inétitution to temporarily
suspend a student who is doing pass-
ing work, and who has met-that insti-
tution’s written requirements as to
quality points and hours.

Rather than attempting a detailed

justification of such a policy, may we .

instead register some general com-
ments on the spirit we hope is behind
the letter which was recently sent to
some 80 students.

If, as some students fear, the
Executive Committee were to use the
underachievement policy as an axe in
a massive “clearing out of dead
wood,” the program would lose any
effectiveness and value. Such an ac-
tion would be unjustifiable to say the
east.

However, the official attitude as
we understand it involves a sincere
attempt to help underachieving stud-
ents help themselves. Underachieve-
ment in nearly every instance is tied
in with some sort of motivational prob-
lem. For many, the problem is a com-
plete dearth of vocational plans, and
therefore no particular incentive for
studying. For others, the problem in-
volves personal troubles at home or
with a girl. In some cases the problem
is one of immaturity—an_ unwilling-
ness to face the fact that the time is
coming when one must leave the ma-
ternal environment of home and
Davidson in order to build a life of
one’s own.

In any of these instances, a semes-
ter or year out of school could well

the Miller’s Tale in the form of num-
bers or other mathematical symbols

The reason for this is simple. The
humanities are, as the name implies,
concerned with human interests, with
feelings and attitudes and aspirations.
Numbers, or any other symbols (short
of conventional language) are simply
incapable of suggesting or describing
emotions, and as such are sterile of
human qualities. Leibnitz’s dream of a
universal symbolic language may yet
be realized. but it is certainly not on
the horizon today.

Perhaps Anderson is reacting
against the very real danger of pur-
suing the liberal arts to the exclusion
of science and mathematics. Such a
one-sided education would unquestion-
ably produce a narrow-minded . in-
dividual, especially in view of the tre-
mendous strides science is making in
today’s world.

But it is equally possible and
equally as dangerous to limit one’s self
to the study of science and mathema-
tics. for in spite of the advance of
modern technology, one must still
contend with the people, the human
element present in the application of
any new scientific or mathematical
discovery. To leave this variable com-
pletely unknown is to leave at least
part of the results of one’s work to
chance—a very un-scientific proced-
ure.

The running feud between science
and mathematics on the one hand and
the humanities on the other will no
doubt continue. It behooves the stud-
ent at a liberal arts college such as
Davidson, no matter what his field of
study, to become aware of the
strengths and limitations of both
points of view. and to keep his mind
open to the changes, both technologi-
cal and humanistic, which are taking

place every day.
J.R.W.

provide an invaluable thinking period
in which the underachiever might in-
deed find his feet. And ordinarily, the
suspension would be a step which the
student would not take by himself.
Suspended students could be encour-
aged to find a job, preferably away
from home, and perhaps the school
(through the Union Placement Service
or Dr. Hight’s Counseling Office)
could even take an active hand in
finding each underachiever a worth-
while temporary occupation.

The key phrase in the entire let-
ter was the one which guaranteed an
“intensive examination” of each case
considered for suspension. A sub-
standard grade point average could
reflect anything from a genuinely bad
attitude to the refusal on the part of
some student to take any of numerous
crip courses in order to pad his aver-
age.

In other instances, and this hits
awfully close to home with us, stud-
ents attempting to keep an extracur-
ricular organization going may be
found hurting in comparison accord-
ing to a computer’s account of their
grade potentials. Innumerable other
personal factors, including perhaps to
some extent the student’s own desires
on the subject, should be considered
in a suspension decision.

We trust these considerations
have been taken into account by the
originators of the underachievement
program, and if so, we hope the stud-
ents involved will take the letter as a
challenge rather than a threat. DTS

Students At Bob Jones

Skip Cuts For Church |

BY CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Managing Editor

Thou shalt not cut thy classes at Bob Jones University.

Nestled deep in the Bible
Belt of South Carolina, the
“world’s most unusual univer-
sity” proclaims that its purpose
is ‘to excel all other schools in
the thoroughness of its Chris-
tian training.”

To carry out the edict of
thoroughness, the rulers of
this Greenville citadel against
“all athiestic, agnostic, pagan,
and so-called scientific adul-
terations of the Gospel” have
made the campus a replica of
John Calvin’s Geneva.

While Calvin’s descendants at
Davidson are allowed to absent
themselves from 25% of their
courses in evolution and modern
biblical criticism, Bob Jones
pupils are confronted with
somewhat stiffer attendance re-
quirements.

“For the purpose of leaving
the city of Greenville. each
student is allowed. the equiva!-
ent of one full week of cuts per
semester, if the proper permis-
sion has been secured.

“No cuts may be taken at the
following times: (1) during
Bible Conference Week; (2)
within three weeks of Cari:

mas holidays; (3) within three
weeks of Commencement; (4)
within three weeks following
the beginning of any semester;
(5)-within three weéks following
a studént’s entrance; (6) during
mid-semester examinations.

“For each class absence, a
student will receive a grade of
zero.

“A student is required to
attend alf meals, classes, as-
semblies, efc., unless he is
otherwise excused, and he is
required to be on time.”

With such liberal cuts rules.
the BJU pupil needs a keen eye
to spot legal cut days.

For the 1962-1963 academic
year, the schédule ran ‘as fol-
lows: From Sept. 5 until Sept.
25. thou shalt not cut. Thou
salt not eut Nov. 1, 2, 5 and 6.
Thou shalt not cut from Nov. 29
until Feb. 14. Thou shalt not cut
March .14, 15. 18 and 19. Dur-
ing the week of March 31-April
7, thou shalt not cut. Thou shalt
not cut after May 3.

Bob Jones does allow its boys
and girls one week during the
springtime to escape the class-

Carrell Reviews

BY DANNY CARRELL
Student Body President
1962-1963
Gd. Note: The following is
@ record of the many trials of
lest year’s Student Council.
On minor issues the council
recorded successes. On major
issues the council collided
head-on with Trustee and Ad-
ministration opposition and
student apathy. Danny Carrell,
head of the council, is now at
Oxford on a Rhodes Scholar-

ship.

A main concern of the council
was to act as a mediator between
the students and the faculty and
administration. The council was
instrumental in having the
faculty repeal the holiday clause
of the new absence system. The
mass exodus that was feared by
many faculty members upon re-
moval of the clause did not oc-
cur.

SOBRIETY REIGNS

The council was not as suc-
cessful in its request for a re-
peal of the off-campus drinking
tule. As long as there is the
feeling among a majority of
faculty members that drinking
is morally wrong and/or detri-
mental to the educational pro-
cess, and as long as there is the
feeling that the existing rule
curbs excessive off-campus
drinking, progress in this area
appears impossible.

No concrete action resutted
from the student-administration
discussions on the parking prob-
lem or on the question concern-
ing three reviews on the same
day.

Student council By-Laws 2, 3,

8, 10, 13, and 15 were amended.
By-Law 2 was completely revised
to include the full set of elec-
tion procedures.

Most of the other changes
were also procedural, but. one
did provide for student repre-
sentation on the Faculty Com-
mittee on Fraternities, Clubs,
and Social Life. Representation
on the Building and Grounds
Committee and on the Reynolds
Lecture Committee is pending.

The council. attempted to
make its Monday assembly pro-
grams interesting not only for
the students, but also for the
faculty, administration, and
Davidson community.

Guest speakers included Rep.
Charles R. Jonas, Rep, Robert
W. Hemphill, Senator Thrustos
B. Morton, and James Farmer,
National Director of CORE.

NSA LAUDED
Membership in the National
Student Association proved

beneficial. Davidson was rep-
resented at the ‘62 spring re-
gional and at the 15th National
Student Congress.

Material from NSA on Euro-
pean travel, the Peace Corps,
and the U.N. was made avail-
able to the student body through
various campus organizations
or designated representatives.

Election Identification. Cards
were used this year. Although
there was no increase in the
number of ballots cast, the card
system proved to be a conven-
fence for those who did vote.
Provisions were also made for
two polling places, afternoon

room.

But unlike Davidson, which
releases its captives for a
week of beer-guzzling in Flori-
da, Bob Jones uses the valua-
ble hours to hold a Bible Con-
ference Week, which the cate-
log calis a “special advan-
tage.”

« .,. the Conference brings
to the campus America’s out-
standing orthodox Bible teach-
ers, pastors, and evangelists. All
regular academic work is sus-
pended for the Bible Confer-
ence, which takes the place of a
spring vacation.”

The hope. of course, is that
ministers will swarm forth from
Bob Jones to convert the infidels
at Davidson and other bastions
of 20th Century religion.

In the frank words of Bob
Jones’ president, religion is a
natural thing at Bob Jones. “It
is not stereotyped, strained, or
‘overly pious.’ It is simple and
unaffected. Every class is open-
ed with prayer, and our social
gatherings blend easily and na-
turally into ‘a little prayer be-
fore we go,’

voting, and absentee balloting.

There was other action taken
by the ‘62-63 council. It was
instrumental in having the
Trustees eat lunch at the fra-
ternity houses during their
February visit.

Upon request of the council,
a telephone was placed on the
third floor of Richardson. A
questionnaire concerning  rec-
reational facilities on the col-
lege property adjoining Lake
Norman was distributed.

The Student Council instigat-
ed the elimination of the lan-

guage lab fee. Moreover, it:

maintained supervision over alt
student organizations by means
of the Student Activities Com-
mittee. The usual appointments
of students to serve on various
faculty committees were also
made.
SABBATH DEFENDED

An attempt was made to have
the library opened on Sunday
night. This request was refused
due to the objection of the
Trustees against decreasing the
sanctity of the Sabbath.

Discussion was held on stand-
ardizing the Honor Court dis-
missal procedures and on decid-
ing what body has the power to
interpret the Honor System and
the Student Body Regulations.

A proposed amendment to
specifically give the Honor
Court the power of interpreta-
tion failed to receive the 2/3
majority needed in order to
present the proposal to the
student body. It received the
approval of a simple majority
both times it was voted upon,
however.

REPERSPECTIVE ==

Rabble - Rousing Wallace

Ignites Birmingham's Fuse

BY RICK von UNWERTH

The jingle ran like this: ;

“George Wallace, George Wallace, Alabama’s fight-
in’ judge....” ;

Alabama’s fightin’ judge came into office as an
astute, however small-time, crook. He is no longer small-
time. As an ambitious young jurist, His Honor had the
privilege of meddling with some property and with 30
days, perhaps, of a man’s earthly tenure. Now he is
dealing in lives.

Some call him crackpot, rabble-rouser, public
menace; others are calling him a murderer.

Three weeks ago school officials in Birmingham and
Tuscaloosa, Alabama, had resigned themselves to national
pressure and, in the interests of the public welfare, had
prepared for peaceful integration in the elementary
schools.

The public weal, however, is the province of
Governor George C. Wallace, and his interpretation
was a little different.

Whether from personal conviction or political ex-
pediency, Wallace threw his own bomb into Alabama’s
lap. The state survived the concussion, but the lethal,
fragments continue to pelt the streets and citizens of
the governor’s victim.

Excitement lends greater short-run pleasure than
tranquillity, and thoughtless people seek excitement
where it offers. Wallace is playing exciting music from
the State House in Montgomery, and two sixteen year
old boys took up the dance Sunday.

The death of a colored boy was not a result of out-
raged conviction. It was a macabre prank in keeping with
the spirit of Birmingham’s Race Festival.

Negro leader James Farmer addressed the Davidson
student body last spring, relating at one point the story
of his first meeting with his skin color. “Mother,” he had
said as a pre-school child, ‘that little boy got a coke in
there. Why can’t we get one?” Typical?

Four little colored girls came to the same re-
alization in Birmingham last Sunday. Their exper-
ience was somewhat harsher than Farmer's, and it
was something more than a lesson to them. They
didn’t hear it from their mothers; it wasn’t explained |
to them. A bomb isn’t very articulate; nor very
tender.

The backwash of Wallace’s. courageous stands, and
of his graceless withdrawals, has swamped the state of
Alabama with bilious resentment; in some cases flavored
with hemlock.

Something must be done; but how long can we let
George do it?
