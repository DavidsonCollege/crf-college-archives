Straight from England:

thoughts on alcohol at Davidson

By RORY T.C. CORNISH

I, as an international drinker of
some standing (mostly horizontal),
arrived at Davidson from a rigorous
campaign in the University of 'East
Anglia’s bar and numerous London
public house floors to experience the
delights of North Carolinian nectar. I
approached the 900 Room with Percy,
an intimate friend, filled with appre-
hension: I was the only person on the
other side of the counter. Assured
that the establishment was open I
purchased a beverage of dubious
content. The content, whatever it did’
contain, was of little alcoholic value to

an old war-lord and campaigner like
myself.

After a few hours I was surrounded
by self-confessed rednecks who
claimed to have alcoholic leanings.
They leant in the general ‘direction of
my pitcher! I bought another pitcher;
they leaned some more! Then the
asked ‘‘What do you think of purdy
bar?’’ I elaborated for another hour.

The first thing that struck me was
the lack of clientele. When we walked
up to the bar, numerous barmen
would rush up and ‘demand’ to serve
you. In England, the spending public:
usually outnumber the bar staff!

‘‘Why do so few students frequent
the 900 Room?” I asked. My redneck
friend, who claimed to be an intellec-

tual who had had too much sun,
maintained that it had something to

‘ott predicted each student

Although the 900 Room is
not the only place students
drink, the amount of beer sold
by ARA Slater is some indica-
tion of how much Davidson
students drink.

Ron Scott reports the 900
Room serves about 5000 glas-
ses or 450 gallons of beer per
week. ‘‘This is not really a lot
of beer,’’ reports Scott. ‘‘This
figure averages out to four
glasses of beer per student
each week.”’

According to Scott, the
amount of beer sold depends
on the programing. Friday
and Saturday nights are the
busiest: nights for the bar.
Scott says, ‘‘On a Monday
night when there is no enter-
tainment in the room we sell
about 1500 glasses of beer to
about 250 students. This aver-
ages out to be six glasses of
beer per person.

The amount of beer sold is

below the amount projected by
ARA upon opening of the 900
Room. Scott says, ‘‘We fig-
ured each student would spend
about $1.50 a week on beer.
We have never reached that
amount. It actually averages
out that the student body only
spends $1.00 a week.”’

Scott reports most students
spend their money on Strohs
beer. The most popular
‘*munchies”’ are corn chip type
foods such as Fritos and
Doritos.

The 900 Room employs four
to five workers on busy nights
such as Disco nights. On
quieter nights they employ
three. They always have at
least two people working: one
at the door and one behind the
bar.

ARA Slater also provides
kegs to Patterson Court par-
ties, ‘‘On a busy weekend,’’
reports Scott, ‘‘we sell an
average of 300 gallons of beer.
There are 15'% gallons of beer
in one keg which means an

Beer flows freely through ba

average of 150-175 glasses of
beer per keg depending upon
who is pouring.”

Scott provides an average of
two kegs for single house
parties and four degs for
combined house parties. The
combined house parties usu-
ally draw around 200-300 peo-
ple.

“Of course Patterson Court
does not always buy its beer
from us. There are other
distributors in the area.’’ adds
Scott.

THE 900 Room is not the only ‘‘bar in town”’.

do with the number of stairs. ‘‘They
just can’t make it up here, man,” he
said. ‘After all that studying only a
few of us die-hards have the stamina
to scale the steps to heaven. I put my
ability to be in the 900 Room every
night to my baseball training,’ Rick
further advanced.

Disappointed with the effect of
numerous pitchers, both to my meta-
bolic and mental processes, I asked,
‘“‘Why is your beer so weak.”’ ‘They
only brew it for seven days,’’ was the
reply. ‘‘But there are numerous
Scotch/Irish in North Carolina,” said
I, ‘‘and it is well known that although
some people die of thirst, the Irish are
born with one.”

It was approaching 10 pm, they left
me to study. Alone in my solitude I
continued drinking, wondering what
went wrong with Davidson. “Protest-
ant work ethic,’’ I thought. ‘‘God,
how glad I am to be Catholic, and an
Irish Catholic to boot.’’ I drank
another pitcher.

‘What's this, people are starting to
arrive in the bar and it’s only 11 pm?”’
The real hard-core arrived. As the six
of us drank and discussed topics
ranging from politics to the price of
beer, a thought struck me; ‘* American
beer must have a delaying effect, yet
Bacchus still lives, but not in David
son. Where the hell is the old Greek
gentleman?”

Point: If James Joyce,
Thomas, Winston Churchill or even
Dean Martin were at Davidson, they
would have withdrawal symptoms.

vas no definite

age control. The only way to
establish ‘‘a hard line of
authority’, as he put it, was
to demand that ID’s be shown
upon entrance.

‘*‘You have to have your
driver’s license to drive a car,
and an ID is required to get a
check cashed,”’ he said. ‘“This
same principle applies with the
900 Room.”

Scott is cognizant of the fact
that this new practice goes
against the Davidson ‘‘atmos-
phere of trust, truthfulness”’.
But he points out that if an
offense occurred and the beer
permit was revoked as a
resuilt....’’Then those alumni
and trustees who had initial

doubts concerning the privi-
lege of alcohol consumption in
the 900 Room could come back
and say, ‘I told you so!’. We
might never get the privilege
back.

As it is, the license is not
revoked for a thirty-day period
or something, but rather three
years. Also, a license revoca-
tion could possibly cause a
‘ripple effect’ in our other
Slater operations across the
state. We just don’t want to
take the chance.”’

Under the present I1D-check
system, if a student forgets
his ID, he puts his name and

rx

address on.# tatu. Tic card is
filed, and ‘upon the student’s

next visit to the 900 Koom, the
card is removed from the file
if he has his ID. If he forgets
his ID a second time in a row,
he is refused entrance.

Several students, however,
have pointed out the ridicul-
ousness of the situation. One
student frequently accompan-
ies a friend into the 900 Room.
She is ‘‘of age”, but does not
drink. One night, she forgot
her ID twice in a row and was
turned away at the door.

A similar situation occurred
with a group of ‘‘regulars’’
who visit the 900 Room night.
‘ly. Stated one: ‘Obviously,
the doorman: knows us by

now. If we forget our ID twice,
it seems a bit extreme for them
to turn us away.”

Moreover, the “card-sign-
ing’’ process does not intently
correct the problem of under-
age drinkers in the 900 Room.
If a student signs a card, is
admitted, and then is found to
be underage by an ABC Board
investigator, the simple sign-
ing of 'a card does not protect
Slater from having its beer
license revoked in any way.

An alternative plan has
been presented to Scott, in
which all students would sign
a list containing their birth-

date, address, etc. Hence, if he

ever forgot his ID, he would
sign a card, and signatures
would be compared.

When presented with this
plan, Scott insisted that indu-
cing students to carry 1D’s is
the best possible solution, yet
stated that he and the Union
Board might possibly make
refinements in the future. ‘‘We
are continually pursuing bet-
ter ways to work it,’’ he said.

In the meantime, students
will have to put up with the
inconvenience of proving their
identification before being
granted the privilege of con-

_gsuming their ‘‘favorite beve-

rage” in the 900 Room.
