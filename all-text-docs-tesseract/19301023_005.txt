the hub of Eastern Carolina, is located in

is the second largest bright leaf tobacco
market in the world.

This association is composed of represen-
tatives of the different news publications
from various colleges and universities in
North Carolina, and meets twice yearly.
Each year it convenes in a different city.
Two, years ago it met in Hickory, and last
year held its meeting in High Point. This
year’s convention at Greenville will be the
farthest east the association has met.

The Davidsonian, Year Book, and the
“Yowl”—the humorous magazine—will have
two representatives, probably the editors-in-
chief and the business managers. For the
past two years, Davidson has been repre-
sented on the official staff of the Press As-
sociation, having been represented last year
by Bob Jarratt as president, and this year
by Bob King as treasurer.

As has been the custom, the association
will probably hold its meetings in the form
of banquets, after which their business will

it was in the first of these that he made
this assertion. To quote him verbatim, he
says on page 187 of volume 1:

“The first record of a forward pass be

ing successfully used is on October 13,
1906, when Davidson defeated Georgia, 15
to 0. The reports of the game say that Da-

{vidson used a short pass over the middle
of the line with great effect. In fact, the

forward pass in the Tech-Davidson tilt:
“Hightower of Tech made 25 yards on a

The issue preceding, in, November, 1906,
has further enlightenment about the “new
rules.” It said: “The new rules certainly
have added ginger to the plays and as to the
roughness opinions are varied. But one fact
notice is that there are not so many
players hurt.’ This latter was probably due
to the epen game which football
started indulging in about that time.

Mr. Woodruff at the opening of chapter
13, entitled “The Forward Pass Arrives,”
had this to say: “In considering the football
1906, we must take into consid-
eration the fact that this was the first year
of the forward pass and that the game was

Cumming Helps in
Writing New Book

How would you like to be facing an angry
quartet of Alaskan bears, gnashing
their teeth within two jumps distance, with
no protection but a movie camera and two
cartridges in your rifle? Or dangle over two

huge

thousand feet above floating icebergs below
with nothing but a slipping left toe to sup-
port you? Or trek through the snow of an
Alaskan blizzard, your trail lost for days, and
cight out of eleven of your horses dead of
starvation and cold? Or catch a man red-
handed just after he had blown his partner
all over a five-acre lot with five and a half
cases of dynamite? Or talk by lone camp
fires at night with “Old Man Hasselborg,”
famous Alaskan trapper, who has lived the
life Robert W. Service writes about?

These and a score of other tales are to
be found in the new library book, “The Wild
Grizzlies of Alaska,” written by John M.
Halzworth with the collaboration of Prof.
W. P. Cumming of the Davidson faculty.
The book portrays the high adventure of
a hunter-naturalist in the wilderness regions
of the sub-arctic Alaska. Photographs of a
hundred and fifty bears taken at all sorts
of hair-raising close-up ranges, with vivid
accounts of the thrills experienced*in making
them, make this book a vivid first-hand ac-
count’of the Alaskan bear, the biggest car-
nivorous animal in the world.
