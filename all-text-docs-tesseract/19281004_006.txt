Rhodes Scholarship
Offers Opportunity
For Classical Study

By Mason Hammond
Former Rhodes Scholar at Balliol Col-
lege, Oxford; B.A. Harvard, Summa
Cum Laude; B.A., Oxford, Highest
Honors; Tutor in Classics at Har-
vard University

A course of study, or “School,” at
Oxford falls into two parts, each ter-
minated by a set of examinations.
Usually, though not necessarily, both
parts are taken in the same subject.
Of the two parts of the School of
Literae Humaniores, or what in Amer-
ica would be comprised under “Clas-
sics.” the first, called “Honour Mod-
erations,” requires five terms (there
are three terms of eight weeks each
in a year) and the second, familiarly
known as “Greats,” seven. While
Greats demands a knowledge of Greek
and Latin which is thoroughly tested
in the examinations by translations,
both sight and prepared, and by
prose composition (verse is optional),
the school deals primarily with an-
cient history and. philosophy. It may,
therefore, be omitted in this discus-
sion. A mere reference also is all that
can be devoted to the opportunities for
research in classical subjects, whether
for the easier degree of Bachelor of
Letters or for the more difficult Doc-
tor of Philosophy.

It is preeminently in “Honour
Mods” that one can Study the aesthet-
ic, grammatical, and archaeological
aspects of the classical World. For
such work the English undergraduate
is generally far better equipped than
would be his American contemporary.
The former has begun the classics
earlier and pursued them more thor-
oughly than is possible in most Amer-

ican schools. By the time that the
English public school (what we
would call a private school) boy

reaches the university, he has done
not only Homer and Xenophon, Cae-
sar, Virgil, and Cicero, but something
likewise of the Greek dramatists and
lyric poets, of Horace, Livy, and the
comedians; he has been drilled too
in prose and verse composition. Fur-
thermore, Greats today, since the de-
velopment of more modern schools at

Oxford, attracts mainly the abler
scholars.. In consequence of these
several factors, the five terms of

“Mods” covers in a more concentrated
fashion as much ground as a four
year classical course in an American
university. The detailed familiarity
with the “set” books, which all Oxford
schools require, here emphasizes their
textual and grammatical problems as
well as their meaning or importance.
One must, moreover be versed in the
environment of ancient literature
Homeric armor, or Roman society in
the age of Cicero—and, if one chooses,
more strictly archaeological matters.

There is one saving counterpoise to
the extent of subject which an Ox-
ford school treats, namely the latitude
of choice allowed among the questions
set in the examinations. Many Ameri-
cans, although they have done clas-
sics in their home university, are so
terrified bysthese formidable aspects
“of “Mods” that they take advantage
of their degrees to get senior stand-
ing. This enables them to proceed di-

rectly to the final school, “Greats,”
over which they can spend two or
three years. In_ reality, however,

while our classical courses may not
teach us to write sapphics or scan
Pindar, it certainly gives one an ad-
vantage over the English undergrad-
uate in so far as it provides a more
mature appreciation and a wider ac-
quaintance with the subject than could
be obtained in school. An American
who has had college Latin and Greek
ought, in fact, to find little difficulty in
doing well, if not brilliantly, in “Mods”
after two terms, especially with hard
work and some preliminary reading of
the texts during’ the preceding sum-
mer, such as is in any case expected_at
Oxford. This would leave the normal

seven terms out of a three year course
for Greats,

There is probably no better approach |

to classical literature than “Mods.” It
by no means slights the dull but in-
evitable drudgery in grammar and
textual criticism. But it does not, as
sometimes happens in Atmerica, stop
at the mere mechanics of the sub-
ject. Like all Oxford schools, it seeks
_ to teach not facts but thought; to de-
velop not the memory but the critical
and appreciative faculty.

At Oxford there are sound scholars,
men whose names are familiar to ev-
ery student of the classics; and at Ox-
ford there are good critics—men who
bring to the appreciation of ancient
literatures’ not only aesthetic taste
but ripe judgment. Nevertheless, for
scholarship alone one can go to Ger-
many, the’ land of the doctorate, and

GOLF TEAM PICKED
FOR FIRST MATCH

Four Men Chosen in Tournament
for Opening Match With
Concord Wednesday

Ts
and

Four men, A. Mills, J. K. Pepper,
J. B. Hutuff, W. L. Hart, were
chosen as members of Davidson's tempo-
rary golf team by reason of their victories
the recent golf tournament. This
teurnament open to all Davidson
students, and its purpose was to select the
men who met the Concord Country Club
yesterday.

This method of choosing the teams for
the various matches is to be continued
throughout the year. A tournament will
be held before each meet and the four

in
was

winners will constitute the team for that
match,

At a meeting of the Golf Club some
time ago A. L. Mills was elected manager
of the team and J. K. Pepper its secretary
and treasurer. Mills is also captain of the
team, having been elected last year.

The team left for Concord yesterday
morning in order to play a practiee round
on the Concord course and thereby to
fatniliarize themselves with the course.

It is thought that a return match on
the Davidson course will be arranged for
next week, A match with the, Gastonia
Country Club will probably be scheduled
for an early date.

It is not yet known whether or not Da-
vidson will enter the North Carolina in-
ter-collegiate matches ‘to be held during
the Christmas holidays on the Sedgefield
Country Club course at Greensboro.

Five hundred dollars has been donated
by the college for improvements on the
course. It is hoped by the Golf Club that
more interest will be taken in golf than
ever before. : .

The results of the match play to select
the members of the team are as follows:

A. L. Mills defeated R. L. Sutliff 8 up
and 6 to play.

W. H. Best defaulted to J. K. Pepper.

W. L. Hart defeated W. H. Lillard 1
up.

J. B. Hutaff defeated J. A. Cannon 9
np and 7 to play.

Twenty states, the District of Co-

enrolled here this year. This number
is distributed among the casses as fol-
seniors, 118; juniors, 116; sopho-
135 and freshmen, 230—with

one man doing post-graduate work.
North Carolina leads in the number
of students, having 356 to its credit.

the District of Columbia, Brazil, China
and Kérea, can furnish only one fa-

Of the twenty states, twelve are
Southern, five are Northeastern and
three are mid-western.

Of the denominations represented in
the student body, irrespective of state
lines, the Presbyterian Church leads
with 472 adherents, followed by the
Methodist, Baptist and Episcopal,
these latter three not having less than
15 followers, The Asociate Reformed
Presbyterian Church claims eight
members and the"Christian three, while
the Moravian, Luthern, Friends and
Catholic sects are content with a
single member each. Two students did
not signify their preference while 12
registered as non-church members.

It is of further interest, likéwise, to
note that 334 students are preparing
for the Bachelor of Science degree

for pure criticism, to France, the

home of the connoisseur. Oxford, how-
‘ever, combines with both of these an-
other rarer-element.. There, more than
in any other place, generations of men
have devotedly fostered the classics,
not as pedants or as dilettantes, But
out of love. of them for their own
sakes. “

Until recently in England, a gentle-
man of culture was marked more by
his familiarity with classical than with
contemporary letfers. This may have
been a narrow point of view; Oxford
may have been unduly hostile to in-
novations. But assuredly such a
leisurely and); cultured attitude to-
wards the classics has endowed its
scholars with a tradition‘and an at-
mosphere like the mellow bouquet of
a fine old port wine. :

REVIEW SCHEDULE MADE
FOR TERM

Conflicts Avoided Under New
System

A new plan of holding monthly reviews
and quizzes, formulated by Mr. F. W.
Hengeveld, registrar, at the request of
the authorities, has recently been inau-
gurated at Davidson. It holds promise
of relieving many of the conflicts hereto-
fore experienced by students. Hereafter,
in accordance with the newly accepted
method, no professor will be allowed to
give any written monthly review in his
subject except during a ten-day period at
the close of every collegiate month. Dur-
ing that time reviews in all subjects will
be scheduled, each day of the ten having
been assigned for certain non-conflicting
subjects. The arrangement
pletely perfected, it is understood, that in

is so com-

no instance will more than a single con-
flict occur the same day.
