Tennis and Golf Wins

This week saw the tennis and golf boys continue to win in inter-
the linksmen while the
court gang did likewise.’ This still leaves the golf team as the only
unbeaten varsity team of the year so far, but the tennis team, with only

: Friday the golfers tee off in the annual Southern Intercollegiate
Golf Tournament which attracts a galaxy of link stars from the
southern and other portions of this country. This tourney is getting
the reputation of drawing bigger and better players than even the
National Intercollegiates. With Pegram, Cooper, Pittman, Sharpe,
and Cox., swing for Davidson, the ‘Cats may see high honors return
on the shoulders of one of these lads. There is but one senior on the
team, Ray Pittman, and this makes next year’s golf team look good
now, with Jack Abels waiting to fight off opposition for the fourth

Finger Early in Game:

Hudson Scatters Lo-
cal Hits

In the first conference game for
both teams, the Tar Heels of Caro-
lina emerged the
Davidson nine last Saturday on
Richardson Field by the close score
of 4-1. The game was costly for
the Cats as they lost the services
of Third Baseman Sam Hemphill
for an indefinite period.

The hitting was about even with
the Tar Heels getting nine and the
‘Cats eight. The margin of the
Carolina victory lay in the fact
that while Bud Hudson was keep-
ing the Wildeat’s hits well scat-
tered, his mates were hitting with
men on the bases and _ fielding
faultlessly behind him.

Tar Heel Leads Hitters

George Nethercutt, Tar. Heel
catcher, was the leading hitter of
the day with a triple, double, and
two singles in five trips to the
plate. Eddie Steere, Davidson right
fielder, was the best hitter for the
Cats, with two singles in three
times at bat. He also turned in the
fielding gem of the day by making
a difficult shoestring catch of Mal-
lory’s line drive and rifling the ball
home to cut off Topkins.

Carolina Scoring

The Tar Heel’s opened the scor-

ning when Nethercutt’s first hit, a
double to center broughts Mallory

through Niven’s error. They scored
again in the fourth when Stern-

came home on Niven’s error on a
double-play ball,

Davidson scored their only run in
the fourth inning when Edmondson
singled, went to second on Vern-
er’s sacrifice, and camé home on
Niven’s single, In the fifth inning,
Nethercutt’s triple sent Topkins, on
first through a fielder’s choice,
home with Carolina’s third run of
the afternoon. Their last run was
scored in the ninth inning when
Rice doubled and came home on
Topkin’s double.
