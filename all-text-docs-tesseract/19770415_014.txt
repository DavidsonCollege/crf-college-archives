Soccer springing:
Patton keys team

By GEORGE STROBEL
Staff Writer

Even without next year’s
coach Davidson’s soccer team
is still very active. Davidson’s
Club seccer team is doing well
in the middle of this spring
season.

Paricipation with the club
soccer team is not mandatory
but many of next year’s key
players practice regularly. The
iron men of this year’s club
soccer team are Dave Patton,
‘Stott Wall, Jeff Jackson,
Mike Heinig and Kevin Ro-
bins.

Patton is the key figure on
the team, scoring three of
Davidson’s four goals in a
recent 4.3 victory over Apollo
soccer club in Charlotte.

The success of next’ year’s
soccer team, though, depends
on the selection of the new
soccer-track coach by Athletic
Director Cartmill.

Cartmill has stated that out
of 45 applicants he has nar-
rowed it down to about three
men. A’‘final selection is
expected in the next 2-3
weeks. ;

In any event next yeer’s
team is going to need amore
balanced attack to take somg
of the pressure off Patton, who
scored about half of David-
son’s goals last season.

To accomplish this, out-
going coach Chip Stone has
worked with the team to
perfect a set style of soccer.
This would tend to creat more

team play rather than indivi-
dual efforts.

Much to Coach Stone's cre-
dit is the fact that all four of
Davidson’s goals last Satur-
day were scored off of set
plays.

Patton should have plenty
of help next year from D.C.
Augustine, Joel Shirk, David
Harrington, Doug Shuessler,
Kevin Robins and several
good-looking recruits.

The team will still miss
departing seniors Paul Parker,
Gordon Maner and John

Swanson and the leadership
they provided the team.

Athlete of the Week

Attitude drives Blinkhorn

By MIKE LINS
Staff Writer

For two years now, Rick
Blinkhorn has stood out as a
leader on the Davidson
baseball team. However, when
he first tried. out last year, few
people suspected that the
sophomore would become
what many claim is the best
second-baseman in_ the
Southern Conference. For this
reason, he is our ‘‘athlete of
the week.”’

The reason few suspected
Blinkhorn’s talent is that he
did not even play baseball as a
freshman. Since he is a
chemistry major and plans to

go to medical _ school,
Blinkhorn wanted to establish
himself academically. He
seems to have done just that

Blinkhorn

as he has an impressive 3.6.
GPA and his prospects for
medical school look good.

As-a sophomore, Blinkhorn
not only made the team but he
became the starting second
baseman ffor the Cats.
Throughout the Southern
Conference last year there
were several fine defensive
second-basemen, and
Blinkhorn was certainly one of
them.

Even beyond his defensive:

prowess, Blinkhorn became
the best hitting second
baseman in the Conference.
He finished the seasom with a
.354 batting average, which
placed him ninth among the
best hitters in the Conference.
Blinkhorn made the second
team All-Southern Conference
and it was a shock to everyone
on the team, including Coach
Palmer Muench, that he had
not been named to the first

team. He was also elected
Most-Valuable Player for the
Cats in 1976.

This season Blinkhorn’s
defensive prowess _ has
continually been called upon,
to knit the Cat infield,
together. He started off this
season at second base, but has
had to intermittantly switch
to short-stop whenever

-problems have arisen there.

This ability to move around to
different positions of the
infield reflects Blinkhorn’s
versatility as an infielder.

Blinkhorn’s hitting this
season has not equalled last
Years: 0u0, 10 1s “still
imp-ressive.He’s hitting .278
at present, though for most of
the season he as hit above
.300.

His hitting has been
impressive in that he leads the
team in triples with three and
is tied for doubles with four.

So it is clear that Blinkhorn
is a leader for the Cats is all
facets of the game. Part of his
success must be accredited to
his dedication and his enthusi-
asm. Though the Cats have
been struggling this season,
Blinkhorn has continually
been enthusiastic about
playing.

Coach Muench has been
persistent in stressing the
importance of confidence and
aggressiveness in order to win.
Blinkhorn has both of these
qualities, and is a team leader
in instilling them in the other
players.

Blinkhorn is very optimistic
about next year’s season.
‘Since we had only three
seniors this year and started
four freshmen, we were lack-
ing a great deal in experience.

“Next year we'll be experi-
enced and that will give us a
lot more confidence.” Blink-
horn believes next year he
personally will have a lot
better season.

““As a senior I feel some
academic pressures will be
eased and that will give me the
time I need to work towards
improvement.”
