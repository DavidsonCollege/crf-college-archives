Women's Tennis Stays On a Roll

by Larry Dagenhart

As the Davidson women’s
tennis team took the Coo-
sawhatchie River exit 28 off of
Interstate 95 on their way to Hilton
Head Island for its spring break,
coach Caroline Price was con-
vinced that there was “something a
bit magical” about crossing a river
with such a name. She was defi-
nitely onto something.

The Coosa Indians, a disunited
but powerful tribe living in the
South Carolinalowcountry around
the mid-18th century, must have
spiritually conveyed some of their
tenacity to the tennis team in help-
ing them win six out of seven
matches during the break.

In the weeks before, the Wild-
cats had been playing what coach
Price had called “10 days of tired

tennis,” no doubt in part owing to
the effect of 11 straight weeks of
classes. The trip to Hilton Head
proved -to be the perfect remedy,
for, with some outstanding indi-
vidual performances, the team
came together and knocked off a
number of tough opponents.

Davidson defeated Cornell 6-
3, Cincinnati 7-2, and Marshall,
Bowling Green and Xavier each
by ascore of 8-1. Their only loss
came against Columbia, a team
which had been playing on the
island all of the previous week.

Still, the Columbia match in-
cluded three 3-setters in singles
and a couple of strong 2-setters in
doubles.

“Xavier and Bowling Green
should have been close,” said a
beaming Price. “But we were

stronger physically and emotion-
ally and we got 8-1 wins instead of
5-4. Collectively, everyone per-
formed well so the team reached a
new level. They were great to watch
and everyone was operating on all
cylinders,” she added.

The team continued to get
strong performances from Sarah
Melson and Mary Beth Ruth.
“Sarah has put together matches
emotionally. She’s improving in
her ability to focus, giving her
strong wins,” commented coach
Price.

“Mary Beth is consistently-
beating more talented players than,
herself. She has this tremendous
will to win which is physically
manifested. She will literally willa
match into the win column.”

before finishing the trip against
ACC opponent N.C. State.
Davidson went 2-3 for the week,
running their season record to"13-
12, 5-2 in Big South play.

The ‘Cats opened the week
with a 6-3 victory at Winthrop.
The Wildcats led 4-2 after thé
singles and. sealed the victory by
winning two out the three doubles
matches. Kurtis Zabell and John
Beyer, playing at number one
doubles, won. their match after
being down-5-4 in the third.

Davidson had an easy matchat
Augusta, posting a 9-0 shutout.
Strong performances were tured
in by Zabell atnumber three singles
and Dale Voeks and Patrick Jop-
ling atnumber two doubles. Zabell
fought off two match-points in
getting his win, while Voeks and
Jopling erased a 5-4 deficit in the
third set.

Coastal Carolina hie to be
a tougher opponent than Augusta,
and the Chanticleers defeated

Davidson 5-4. Coastal Carolina’s

lineup was strengthened by sev-
eral foreign players. Coach Jeff
Frank saw the match slip away
with a three set defeat of Zabell
and Beyer at number one doubles.
He was pleased with Albie
Varoski’s play in a tough three set

loss to Coastal’s number one

ments at UNCC and UNCG, the
squad notched wins against
Catawba and Liberty, while play-
ing to about a .500 record. “The
greatest problem this time of year

is inconsistency, .” explained Hawk-
ins, who allowed that the team’s

sparse practice schedule explains
much of that. Hawkins has noticed
particularly the improvement of
sophomore Jennie Wagner and

freshmen Amy Howard and Jen"

Guise.

Next year’s strengthened
schedule threatens to hand the
Wildcats some lumps, and Hawk-
ins says she would be “pleased
with a .500 season” next fall. But
all the elements are present for
another successful season, and it
won’ tbe very surprising if the team
spends a great deal of time receiv-
ing awards again next fall.

player, who has points on the pro
tour.

“They are having a tough time
finishing off their mathces right
now,” said Frank. “I think they
may have a lack of confidence.”

The match against defending
conference Campbell was not a
confidence booster for the Wild-
cats. Campbell defeated Davidson
8-1. “Campbell is an older, experi-
enced team and they have a lot of
talent,” said Frank.

“Joey Manibo turned in
Davidson’s only win at number six
singles, keeping his undefeated
conference record intact. Manibo
finished the season 7-0. Russell
Briggs had an excellent 6-1 mark

' in conference play.

seen the benefits because of Beth.”
Her presence is certainly im-
proving Davidson athletics, but
Manson still sees the difficulties of
Davidson’s situation. She com-
mented that “Davidson is Division
I but we’re not run like a Division
I program.” In addition, she spoke
of several improvements that are
needed; namely, a bigger weight
room, a complete fitness center
with bikes and stairmasters and,
finally, a separate weight room for
students and athletes. Manson also
urges students to have patience
with the weight room in terms of

‘hours. She knows the hours are not

the best but hopes students under-
stand the liability problems and

Team Returns

tion

Davidson Athletic Director
Terry Holland and Aquatics Di-
rector Ron Morrow announced
Thursday that the Wildcats would
begin fielding a Division I swim-
ming and diving team in the fall of
1991.

The team will compete in a
minimum of ten meets spread out
over the course of the school year.
Possible opponents include Duke,
Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech and
UNCC.

“Tt was really just a matter of
time,” said Holland, “before we
reimplemented the swimming and
diving program after we moved
into Baker Sports Complex. The
Cannon Pool gives us a top-notch
facility to compete in, and we’re
all looking forward to renewing
traditional rivalries and beginning
new ones.”

“We're all very excited about
the return of swimming and diving
to Davidson,” said Morrow. “We
had a very successful club team
this past year, and the addition of a
strong recruiting class should help
us return the swimming and diving
program to the most competitive

students.
Despite the desperate need for
improvements, Manson enjoys
many aspects about Davidson:
knowing mostof the hard-working
athletes, the people and students
we have here and, most impor-
tantly; the size-of the school. “I
went to both (small and large
schools) and would rather stay in

‘thesmall college atmosphere,” she

said.

_ Finally, Mansen hopes to
debunk the stereotype of the “de-
feminization” of women who hap-
pen to be weightlifters or athletes

in general. She commented that

“being muscular and strong doesn’t
make you less of a woman. I hope
that women will see that they can
