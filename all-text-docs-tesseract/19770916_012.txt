His specialty is human memory.
“Memory, I have found, is dependent
upon meaning I am researching how
people remember prose.’’ He has
published a number of essays in
various journals and plans to continue
researching and publishsing.
Brockway taught a year at the
University of Constance in Germany.
“Germany is more Americanized than
any other Europeam country. I was
amazed at the bureaucracy and

materialism there.” :

As economic conditions in Europe
worsened, Brockway chose to return
to the United States where he
assumed.a polition in the Pshchology
Department at Penn State.

“T either want to be at a very large
university which had exceedingly
good research facilities because I’
enjoy research or at a very small
university or college where I could
teach as well as research.”

“T enjoyed my undergraduate stu-
dies at Lafayette because it was small
and there was close contact with
students and faculty. At a large
university you have to get used to
anonymity.

‘‘You can go around for weeks
without having anyone talk to you as
they go by, or say hello or even
smile.”’

Brockway, 32, is married and has
no children. His wife is a systems
analyst. Brockway reads expensively
and is interested in photography,
working with wood and automobiles.

Timothy N. Webster

Timothy N. Webster recently joined
the Psychology Department. Web-
ster.a 1973 graduate of Davidson,
expressed his delight at again being a
part of the College community.

“‘T was interested in this sort of
teaching--working with bright and
motivated students,’’ he explained.

Webster said that the biggest
change since his undergraduate days
in the change to coeducation.

“I don’t know if coeducation is
necessarily responsible for this but
my impression of faculty-student
relationships seems to have im-
proved. Not to say they were bad

‘ when I was a student, but there seems
to be less tension and a more relaxed,
informal atmosphere.’’

Webster has a special academic
interest is clinical psychology and
psych-therapy. Another major thrust
of his studies include research in the
area of assertiveness and its impact
upon intimate communication.

The transition from student to
facutly member was somewhat dis-
arming, Webster said.

“It’s definately ‘a major change,”’
he explained. ‘‘I don’t have any
complaints. The faculty is very
receptive and view me as a col-
league,”’ he continued.

“it’s a difficulty I have to deal with
relating to these people on a peer
level.

“T still have a great deal of respect
but it’s a different thing when you’re
a colleague.”’

In-his new position as faculty
member Webster expressed the hope
that “the College will try to seek out
and achieve a greater diversity in

people’s background and perspective
on life.”’

In his spare time Webster likes to
“get out and get away from buildings
and people.’’ He especially likes the
North Carolina mountains where he
