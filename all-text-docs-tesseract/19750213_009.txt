Let me consider well upon what plane I will con-
descend to communicate with you this blessed
week. Simple parable, revealing allegory, or
through a burning bush?

You think of me as a rather inept Sports Editor,
gifted but erratic at best. Ah, I am indeed all of
that and so much more. Sports to me are merely a
diversion, a panacea for you unthinking, insensible
slugs.

I see you lounging in the lobbies on a Sunday af-
ternoon watching football. You dull your brains
with narcotic cathode rays, then you burn your-
selves out over twisting lines of print.

But not me! I have seen through this fatal trap,
and I know where Truth lies. And I, in a benevolen-
ce as Infinite as my wisdom, I lower myself to your
level in these, my attempts at aiding you in perhaps
Seeing. I hope, perhaps all too vainly, that maybe
there is someone, somewhere who is an equal,
someone who is worthy of comprehending the full
glory of what Ihave tosay.

And so I sit here, writing a few vague allusions to
football or b-ball to satisfy the title of this dipshit
job, hoping that someone will be raised out of the
slime that is mainstream Davidson by this, my
public forum.

If you are out there; won’t you please, please get
in touch with me? Take me away from this
stultifying task, this moronic collection of fools. I
deserve far better than this, and you do too.

Together we can make it. Let me know, okay?

‘OUIPS AND CRANKS”

Revised Standard Version

Now Available in the Union During
Exams And Spring Break

The Davidson women’s
basketball team has been
placed on athletic probation by
the NCAA Infractions. Com-
mittee due to an incident: in-
volving freshman guard Carol
Folger. The stiff penalty, stem-

ming from an episode in the

Wildcattes’ contest with
Augusta College, January 10 in
Johnston Gym, also bans the
Cattes from any post-season
tournament play this season.

The Committee’s decision,
released February 12, came as
a result of a complaint filed by
referee Jeffrey Frank.

Late in the second half of the
contest with Augusta College,
Coach Joe Duncan sent Folger
into the game to “get in the
way”’ of the opponent’s fast-
breaking guards. Folger, con-
centrating so intently on the
game plan, neglected to check
in at the scorer’s table. Referee
Frank, with what Coach Ken

Schmader termed a “gleeful
look in_his eye,” slapped a
technical foul on the diminutive
redhead. _

She was quoted as saying,
“But...” at which time Frank
charged her with a second
technical foul. Folger stared in
disbelief at her teammates,
then burst into tears and ad-
ministered a vicious driving
kick to the groin of the
astonished referee. As Frank
slumped to his knees, the errant
cager bolted off the court and
out of the gym.

As trainers from both ben-
ches worked to revive the prone
Frank, yet another altercation
broke out on the court. David-
son guard ‘“‘B.T.’’ Tanner ap-
parently went temporarily ber-
serk and blurted out loudly,
COS .%1*¢! ”

Interpretting Tanner’s en-
thusiasm as provocation, the

rushed en force on the Davidson
women. A ghastly battle en-
sued.

After order was finally
restored through the combined:
efforts of the coaches and Cop
Sherrill, Davidson trainer Pat
MacLeod attended to the in-
juries of the injured Cattes.
Sophomore front-liner Nancy
Matheny dislocated her right in-
dex finger in attempting to
gouge out the eyeball of an A.C.

‘player. Dea Booth also injured

her knee trying to run out of the
gym with the game ball.

Frank, still recooperating in
Preyer Infirmary allowed
Women’s Athletic Director,
Pam Drake to speak for him.

“I am really ashamed of our
girls,’’ said Drake. They deser-
ve anything they get from the
NCAA. I’m sorry about what
they did to Jeff. We all ought to
send him a card or some
cookies or something.’’
