Longtime SGA representative
Bill Owens ’06 recently stepped
down from his post amidst allega-
tions of corruption and misuse of
his political
power.

Owens’ resig-
nation comes

byist for the Gay

(GSA) and
Owens’ longtime

Owens’ political enemies say
that Bauer treated him to various
Covington Golf
Course outings,

favorable housing
lottery numbers
and constantly let
Owens cut in front
of him at the line
to Commons.
“What was
going on here was

to get his counterparts to vote
along college party lines and:

das like privatizing work study.
Owens has been constantly
under fire for most of his senior
‘year term for alleged misdealings,
and student government insiders
believe that he only stepped down
because he is facing Code of
Responsibility charges himself.
“There’s no question Owens got
out of there because he has his own
legal troubles to deal with,” said

Huff, as well as other political
pundits, believes that charges

against Owens stem from a shady

relationship with lobbyist Bauer
involving the GSA’s proposal to
inhabit the former CoHo house
next year, called the “Queer
Union” by the GSA.

It is alleged that Owens took
bribes from Bauer and other GSA
officials in order to push their
Queer Union proposal past appli-
cations for more popular ideas like
a new Outpost, an Alpha Phi Alpha

He was given numerous perks
because Bauer and his GSA cronies
wanted that Queer Union so bad

This is not the first time that
Owens has found himself in hot
water. He has repeatedly been
chided by the SGA _ Ethics
Committee for violations includ-

Glenn Huff ’07, editor of The
Davidsonian Politics section. “I
wouldn’t be surprised if this whole
thing erupted because of the Queer

stealing Chick-Fil-A sandwiches
from After Midnight for his own
personal consumption.

Although the charges against
Owens seem unquestionable,
College Republicans ask students
not to consider the problem of cor-
ruption as epidemic within their
party.

“What we have here is a strictly
individualized case of misuse of
political power,” said College
Republicans President George
Williams ’07. “There is no reason
to believe that problems like this
inflict any other member of our
party. In fact, Bill was the only
College Republican to vote in favor
of the Queer Union. Actually, that
should have been a tip-off to all of
us in the first place.”

“His ethical viola-
tions include gerry-_
mandering residence

halls, and ripping

down opponents’
fliers.”

As the SGA Constitution: dic-
tates, Regina Guild ‘o7, the presi-
dent of the Union Recess
Committee, has filled Owens posi-
tion. Owens will begin his Code of
Responsibility hearing sometime
in the next week.
