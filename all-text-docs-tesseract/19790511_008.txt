8—The Davidsonian—May 11, 1979

An’ when dat judgment day comes, yez

By PATSY DANIELS
Staff Writer

It was a cold, cloudy day in
Davidson and the water tower
an ominous.symbol—a symbol)
of what was and who was and
will you be next? I wrapped my
raincoat around me and shiver-
ed as Margaret Miles and Aida
Doss veered off Main Street to
meander around the tombstones
(it was a.Saturday night; what
else was there to do?). It was
then that we chanced upon the
headstone of him or her or
whoever Tunis Hood was.

The rain-streaked, worn
granite face read: Here lies
Tunis Hood. An' when dat
judgment day comes, yez suh,
when it duz come, Tunis is
gonna rise up an’ greet dé
Lawd. REST IN PEACE ‘TIL
THEN, TUNIS.

We tried to discern the
graven date, but could not
because ivy reticulated all over
the base of the gravestone.
Margaret said, ‘“‘Don’t pull that
stuff back, Aida, it’s poison
ivy. Let Patsy do it.” Well, I
don’t like to itch either, so I left
it alone. Thus, you will just
have to take my word for it
when I say that Tunis lived and
died in the nineteenth century.

I must say this now: My
account of Tunis Hood is ima-
ginative. Therefore, if anyone
reading this is related to Tunis,
just remember that I’m not
claiming to be accurate. I only
claim to be interesting, and if
you’re bored already then you
can just make up your own tale
about Tunis or you can com-
plain to my editor (but it won’t
do any good because this is the
last issue of The Davidsonian so
it’s too late for me to be
dismissed from the staff).

After considerable thought
and mnemonic irrelevancy, I
have come up with a possibility
as to who Tunis was, and yes,
who Tunis is. That’s right,
Tunis is with us yet.

First of all, “I believe that
Tunis was a man and probably
still is.. Tunis was once a
professor at Davidson. The
reason he still is is because ‘ole
Tunis had tenure. And all of us
know that tenured professors
never die.

Tunis taught philosophy. He
always wore a toga. He also
wore a garland around his
straight black hair. He believed
that the only thing a man can
know is that he exists. He also
believed that if one really wents
to know this then he must
experience it by climbing the
water tower.

On a bitter night in January
Tunis scaled the ladder of the
tower. The wind whistled
around his ears, his toga whip-
ped around his ankles, the sleet

‘bit into his neck and the bare
trees formed a silhouette a-
gainst the full ‘moon. An hour
earlier, Tunis had been drinking
Cutty Sark behind his lectern. -

As he groped in the dark for
invisible means of support, he
thought, “Only a drunk would
do this; only a drunk should not
do this.’”’ He coined a new

philosophy, which states in

"esoteric phraseology, ‘‘I's

_drank as a skunk an’ I ain’t

gots no bus’ness up here. But

|

how else is I ta knows I ’xist?”’
Tunis slipped on the twenty-
fifth rung and toppled headlong

to the turf. His toga did not ~

serve as a parachute nor did his
lofty ideals transcend the force
of gravity. He rested in pieces
until the Davidson police trot-
ted up on their horses and found
him. The captain studied the
gory heap and said to his men,
“All our horses an’ men ain’t
nev’r gonna put Tunis back
togeth’r gin. Plant ’im.”

After much debate about the
rising cost of pine boxes they
decided against burying him
and instead sold his carcass to
the premedical students. I dis-
covered that all that is left of
our hero is a bicuspid which was
donated to the Mayo Clinic in
1899. It-is preserved under
glass. Anyone can see it for fifty
cents. It is labeled: ‘‘The Tooth
of Tunis. Possibly a relic of
Aurignacian-Magdalenian Peri-
od. Actual date unknown due to
poison ivy.”

The spirit of Tunis is still
with us. And if any doubting
soul wishes to see him, all he
has to do is to sneak down to
the graveyard when the moon is
full and the town is asleep and
the cats are howling from the
broken windows of Gozinya
Palace. Tunis materializes out
of the fog (if there is no fog he
waits until no one is looking and
then makes his entrance).

He poses atop his headstone,
a voluminous black cloak
(stolen from the Drama depart-
ment while Dr. Barber was on
sabbatical) enveloping him from
chin to heel, a dark scowl upon
his visage, and his aesthetic
hands clenched around a tatter-
ed parchment inscribed with
Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations.
When Tunis is under the
weather or under the dirt or
under the impression that he
will have no visitors, Dr.
Cornwell serves as his replace-
ment.

In an interview with
Cornwell, I was told, “Yes, it is
true that I fill in for Tunis Hood
on occasion. With a mere seven
percent, pay increase I have
found it necessary to moonlight
when I can.”

This has been a worthwhile
experience for the famous
English professor. Broadway
has offered him five hundred
thousand dollars to star in their
adaptation of Jaws. Cornwell
flatly refused the offer, stating,

“Heck no. If they won’t let me
portray Henry James, then
they can just find someone else
to make rich.’’ The New York
talent scout then offered him

the opportunity to star as
Charlie Tunis in television com-
mercials. Cornwell also turned
this down, replying that either
role would make him feel like a
fish out of water.

Since we're on the subject,
I'll tell you that the scout than
offered the role to Dr. Cole (his
talent was made known to the
Drama world when he tried to
market a closet-play he’d writ-
ten on the secret. life of Bos-
well.) Cole turned the scout
down, stating, “They just don’t
make finny prey like they used
De: Daggy has a bit more
positive attitude. Says Daggy,
‘“T told them I’d star in the play
if they’d allow me to incorporate
my idea of giving a different
slant on the story: I’d like the
play to be about a vegetarian
shark. And I’d like the story to
be told from the point of view of
the victim. I’d call my interpre-
tation The Edible Wild Plant.”
~The results of this negotia-
tion are pending; however it is
certain that Dr. Randy Nelson
is publishing a critical essay,
his thesis being that Jaws is a
direct allusion to Huckleberry's
Finn.

Tunis became interested in
philosophy while he was an
undergraduate at Princeton. A
journal account unfolds the
epiphany: ‘‘I wuz trudgin’
through de snow one night in de
dead a wint’r, on my ways toa

suh, when it duz come, Tunis is gonna rise up

lecture called: .Washington
stoods up in de boat when he
done crossed de Del’‘ware—
FACT “R FICTION? An I
thinks to myself, ’De fella done
stoods up ‘cause it wuz hiz way
of risin’ "*bove hiz hum’n
condit’n. He musta shaked hiz
fist at the Un’verse and he
musta says, | *X/ST7."’ Tunis
published his philosophical
land mark and gained wide
recognition from the academic
world. He was immediately
offered a position at Davidson.

Let us commemorate Tunis
Hood—philosophos, innovator
of intellectual paraphrasing — he
was a brave and noble man. It is
my sincere hope that each and
every one of you will seek out
his spirit and listen to his sage
analyses of: 1) Life; 2) How it
Felt to Die Beneath the Sniffing
Nostrils of a Nag (Tunis has
written a book on this called,
The Existential Night Mare); 3)
I wish Dr. Bliss Had Been
Present to Tell the Horsemen to
Pass By So's I Wouldn’t Have
Lost My Tooth; 4) Was it
Decent For the Davidson Police
to be Riding Their Horses
Through the Cemetery? And, 5)
To Imbibe Cometh Before a
Fall.
