WILDCATS HAVE HARD GAME
AHEAD IN FURMAN CONTEST

Judging from former games of the sea-
son Coach Laval’s Purple Hurricane is
prepared to uncork a jugful of unex-
pected tricks on the Wildcats Turkey
Day.

Furman has, more than once this sea-
son;surprised its opponents by its for-
ward passing and trick plays. At one
time, in the Georgia game, Furman’s
quarter called for six forward passes in
succession and three of them were suc-
cessful, gaining 35 yards. Again, in that
game the men in purple tried 16 passes
and completed eight of them for a total
of 122 yards. Even against Tech’s pow-
erful defense the aerial route gained
Furman 39 yards. The gains through
Georgia’s line by the Furman backs also
shows that the purple line works well
on the offensive, and an Atlanta paper
reports that Furman’s® ends gave the
Staton brothers a lot of trouble in the
Tech game. These same ends starred in
the South Carolina game, which was
won 7-0 by a trick.

When on the defensive Furman’s line
also showed up well, especially in the
Tech game in which it stopped Tech's
drives until completely worn down, The
line also held South Carolina to five
downs, and results show that 90 per cent
of the tackles in that game were made
by linesmen. Taken altogether, Furman
promises to give the Wildcats a fight
on Thursday.

Comparative scores tell very little, but
from these Davidson has an edge on
Furman if we judge from the results of
the Wofford game, while if we judge
from the S. C. game Furman has the ad-
vantage, for South Carolina played
North Carolina to a tie, the same as Da-

vidson. Furman’s scores so far are:

Furman.---.------ Erskine ~-.----- 7
Furman--- Newberry ------ (1)

DAVIDSON SCRUBS TO PLAY

CLEMSON SCRUBS SATURDAY | .

Saturday afternoon at 2:30, on Sprunt
Field, the Wildkittens wil. meet the
Clemson Scrubs in what is expected -to
be the hardest contest the Wildkittens
have been in this year.

Clemson Scrubs have played the Geo-
gia Reserves, in ‘which game they held
that larger and more experiénced aggre-
gation to a 7-7 tie. Last week they held
the Georgia Tech.Freshmen to a 7-0
score. Clemson is unusually good on her
forward passing and with Reanus and
Turnipseed in the backfield, Davidson
ends and backfield men will have to be
on their toes. These two men are Clem-
son’s outstanding stars and are like
greased lightning on end runs and like
thunderbolts on off-tackle plays.

The Davidson Scrubs have lost only
one game this year and are it better
shape now than ever before, and a battle
royal is expected when these two teams
meet for the final game of the season.

ELSIE FERGUSON WAS GOOD
IN PICTURE “FOOTLIGHTS”

Elsie Ferguson gave a fine perform-
ance in a picture that stands out as one
of the first-rate film productions of the
year. So says Robert Sherwood, of Life,
in writing of “Footlights,” and the Da-
vidson fans heartily agree with him.

One reason advanced for the supe-
riority of this play is that Elsie Fergu-
son and the director, John S, Robinson,
were thoroughly in accord and worked
smoothly together.

[It is not often that such a high-class!
picture penetrates to the “provinces” SO}

quickly. “Footlights” has only been re-
leased about a monthand was shown at
_ Loew’s New York theatre November 5th

and 6th. a

N. C. STATE FRESH TEAM

(Continued frdm page 1)
teams seemed prepared for the aerial
game.
The Wildkittens received the ball at

line plunges, with Captain Crawford
leading the attack, carried the ball to
State’s one-yard line. Here the “Raleigh-
ites” held for downs and the ball went
over. State then punted out of danger,
Hendrix receiving the ball and making
15 yards. The Scrubs made a first down
and then punted. The Fresh returned
the-ball to midfield, where they were
held for two downs and then tried a pass.
One of the Scrubs broke through and
knocked thé pass into the hands of one
of the State men who ran for a touch-
down. Martin again failed to kick goal.

In the fourth quarter the ball see-
sawed up and down the field. Finally
the Kittens again placed the ball on their
opponents’ 15-yard line, where the Rats
obtained the ball. The punt which they
attempted was broken up by one of the
Davidson men, but a State man fell on
the ball. Here Jeanette ran 95 yards
over tackle for a touchdown. This ended
the scoring. In this half the Wildkittens
completed three of the five passes at-
tempted. ?

It would be hard to choose the indi-
vidual stars of the Davidson aggrega-
tion, but Jeanette seemed to be the whole
of the State team. When he had his
hands on the ball, his interference and
his own side-stepping and stiff arm
scemed to work to perfection.

EU. MEMBERS DISCUSS
. GIVING SUPPLIES TO RUSSIA

The program of the Eu. Society, for the
meeting of November 17th consisted. of
the regular debate, a declamation by
B. T. Team, an oration by T. H. Patter-
son ) the inaugural address of P. D.

“| Mille,

The query for debate read: Resolved,
That the U. S. should donate to Russian
relief societies such used clothing and
surplus supplies as cannot be advantag-
eously used by the army or readily dis-
posed of for cash. For the affirmative
J. M. McCutcheon and D. B. Walthall
showed the terrible need for aid in Rus-
sia and that our surplus supplies could
be used there with moral:and political
benefit to the world. On the negative
W. T. Elliott and D. L. Mahood present-
ed the ideas that Russia does not need
outside aid and that we could dispose of
these supplies more profitably elsewhere.
The decision of the judges as well as of
the house was in favor of the negative.

B. L. Team rendered a declamation by
James Whitcomb Riley, “The Old Man
and Jim,” in a very dramatic and ap-
pealing manner and was rewarded with
an outburst of applause at its conclusion.

T. H. Patterson, in an interesting ora-
tion on the Disarmament Conference
pointed out the tremendous issues at
stake in this world meeting and showed
its importance in preventing future
wars.

- The newly elected president, P. D.
Miller, made his ‘inaugural address at
this time. In a logical and spirited
speech he reviewed the past history of
the society, criticised its present situ-
ation, plead for a better allegiance ‘to
its best interests and pledged to it the
‘utmost aid and support of which he is
capable.

McKEITHEN AND BITZER ARE
RECEIVED BY SIGMA UPSILON

Last Wednesday evening in the S. A. E.
hall, the Sigma Upsilon enlarged its
membership by taking in two new men,
Rolston Bitzer and- Harold McKeithen.
These men have been chosen for the
honor because of the special literary
merit they have shown during their col-
lege career.

After the initiation ceremonies Prof. L.
M. Currie read a paper on “The Original
Short Story” and D. M. Chalmers gavea
teview of Elsie Canfield’s new book,
“The Brimming Cup.” Both of these pa-
pers were splendidly prepared and well
delivered. . ‘

At the close of the meeting light re;
freshments were served. f

EU, FRESHMEN STAGE DEBATE
ON JAPAN IN THE FAR EAST

Last Tuesday evening at 6:45 the
Fresh Eumenean Literary Society held
its regular meeting in the Eu hall. After
the reading of the Scripture by the pres-
ident, E. C. Moomaw led the house in
prayer. °° When the business had been
disposed of, an interesting program was
carried out.

The question for debate was, Resolved,
That the Japanese policy in the East
should not be discussed at the peace
conference. Those upholding the affir-
mative were H. M. Moss, F. A. Hopkins
and A. M. McGregor, while J. L. Steele,
P. B. Freeland and L. B. Gibbs argued
the negative. The speakers on both
sides brought forward splendid argu-
ments. The affirmative endeavored to
show that the discussion of the Japanese
policy in the East would be contrary to
the great Monroe doctrine, but L. B.
Gibbs, of the negative, quoting from the
Monroe doctrine, explained that it said

nothing about the nations of the far
East.

The negative argued that the recent
world war plainly showed that compli-
cations in one part of the world are a
ménace to world peace and that the
Japanese policy is a menace and ought
to be discussed at the peace conferenie.
But the affirmative took the stand that
the peace conference was called for the
purpose of discussing armament and not
any one cquntry’s affairs. The judges
decided two to one in favor of the affir-
mative, while the house, voting upon the
merits of the question, voted unanimous-
ly in favor of the nagative.

Declamations were given by J. R.
Earnest and T. C. McSwain. These were
perhaps the best yet heard in the Fresh
Society, and indicated a bright future

for the Eumeneans along this line.
