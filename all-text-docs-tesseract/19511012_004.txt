DR. CUNNINGHAM THEN
SECURED a contract from the Air
Force to train 500 Aviation Cadets
each five months; and, when this
program was curtailed, the way
was opened for the Army to place
an ASTP unit at the college. All
in all, more than 5,000 Army and
Air Force personne) received col-
lege training at Davidson during
the war.

At one point, the 1944-45 session,
the enrollment dropped to 162, the
smatiest student body at Davidson
since the turn of the century. In
only two years the enrollment
climbed to the highest point ih
Davidson's history when approxi-
mately 1,000 students enrolled for
the 1947-48 term.

PROGRESS AND EXPAN-
SION have been the keynotes al!
during the “Decade of Destiny.”
In 1941, Chambers was the only
adequate academic building on the
campus. However, a building cam-
paign was launched under Dr. Wal-
ter |.. Lingle’s administration which
Dr. Cunningham continued. and
four major buildings have now been
completed or near-completed under
the program, The Grey Memorial
Library was dedicated in 1942, the
Martin Science Building in 1944 and
the Charles Worth Johnson Gym-
nasium in 1949. A new college
church is expected to be completed
by January 1, the old gymnasium
is being renovated and remodeled
into a modern Student Union, and
plans for the W. H. Belk dormitory
are in the program,

IN ADDITION TO greatly. in-
increasing the facilities of the
physical plant, Dr. Cunningham has
led an ‘equally successful drive for
a larger endowment. The long,
ten-year fight, which is still being
waged, has brought in some two
and a half million additional dollars
as Davidson’s endowment today
stands at more than $6,000,000.

THE DEVELOPMENT PRO-
GRAM is the largest financial

campaign in which Davidson has
ever been engaged. Set up in 1948,
it was officially launched in 1949
with a goal of $2,500,000. Through
the efforts of Dr. Cunningham and
the other campaign leaders, seven-
teen large donations realized $1,-
600,000 of the goal on a few
months and the goal was success-
fully met and passed in June of
1950,

ALTHOUGH DR. CUNNING-
HAM has met great success as a
fund raiser, his academic and
spiritual contributions to the col-
lege surpass even the. great pro-
gress made during the building and
financial campaigns. The average
size of the classes at Davidson has
been reduced to approximately 25
students, while, the average number
of hours taught by the faculty has
been lowered to 12 per week.
Maintaining its progressive tradi-
tions, Davidson has added a num-
ber of courses to the curriculum,
especially in the fields of fine
arts, music, speech, physical edu-
cations and dramatics.

In 1948, Dr. Cunningham
secured the $50,000 George F.
Baker Scholarships for Davidson,
a recognition which only six other
institutions in the nations were able
to earn at that time. The scholar-
ships were renewed for another
three years last month with an ad-
ditional $50,000 grant.

DAVIDSON MAINTAINED A
long-standing tradition when it
selected an active minister for its
13th president, and probably the
greatest single contribution made
by Dr. Cunningham during the past
decade has been the deepening of
the spiritual life of Davidson and
the constant stressing of character

building.

A champion of the church related
college and all it stands for in ‘its
purest form, Davidson's president
has constantly striven and fought
for Christian education,

In addition to the major con-
tributions made to Davidson, Dr.
Cunningham has found time to
serve his church and nation with
equal distinction.

s e e
IN 1945, -HE SERVED on the
American Section of the World

Council of Churches. ohe of two

representatives of this body from.

the Presbyterian Church, U. S. In
August 1946, he was chosen as one
of ten American churchmen to at-
tend the International Conference
of Church leaders on the Problems
of World Order at Cambridge,
England.

In the summer of 1948, Dr. Cun
ningham attended the First Asz
sembly of the World Council of
Churches in Amsterdam, Holland,
as one of the three delegates. from
the Presbyterian Church, U. S. He
was the official representative of
the Southern Presbyterian Church
at the organization of the Presby-
terian General Assembly of Mexi-
co in 1947, and was chairman of
the North Carolina division of the
China Relief Drive in 1941.

The Presbyterian Church, U. S.,
bestowed it’s. greatest honor on
Dr. Cunningham in 1947 when he
was elected to the highest position
in the church, Moderator of the
General Assembly.

The trustees of Davidson paid
tribute to Dr. Cunningham during
Commencement fast spring when
they presented him a silver serving
tray and passed a resolution paying
tribute to his ten years of leader-
ship. The resolution, in part, de-
clared: “The Board of Trustees
wishes to express its deep appre-
ciation of the magnificent leader-
ship that Dr. John R. Cunningham
has given Davidson College during
the decade since becoming its Presi-
dent; years in which, despite the
tremendous changes and difficulties
involved, the college in many re-
spects has known its greatest ad-
vancement. We would record, too,
the joy and inspiration we, as
members ut the Board, have had

in our relationship with him.”

ULFS Schedules

Four Big Movies

A new drive for memberships to the United Literary Film
Society is planned by the Philanthropic and Eumanean Literary
societies, officers of the organization said today. The poor at-
tendance at the first presentation of the year, ‘““The Baker's
Wife,’’ was attributed by ULFS officials to inadequate promo-

tion with the resultant drive for
more members.

Four more films are scheduled
to be shown during the semester,
and tickets for admission to all
showings may be purchased for one
doar from Jack Hunter or Stuart
Shippey, or in the lobby on the
the days of the scheduled movies.

The purpose of the society is to
bring to the campus outstanding
motion pictures, U. S, and foreign,
that are ordinarily shown only
in larger citfes. It is an excellent

opportunity for students to become
familiar with films that, in the brief
history of this new medium of ex-
pression, have remained as master-
pieces in the literature. The society
has endeavored to present a well-
rounded program, including ex-
amples of both modern and early
filming techniques: “Chaplin Fes-
tival,” October 26; “Long Voyage
Home,” November 9; “39 Steps.”
November 30; “Ivan the Terrible,”
December 7.

Kicks Off Monday National Cup

With a town quota of $2,250.00, exceeding the amount
raised last year, the Davidson division of the Mecklenburg Coun-
ty Community Chest drive gets underway Monday morning
to run through Thursday, October 25. Chairman of the David-
son town drive and college student body drive is Lt. Col. J. L.

Ballard, Jr. Seventeen residential
area chairmen have been named to
{cover Davidson, with three head-
ing up the industrial drive.

Col. Ballard emphasized the vital
part- which the student body will
play in this drive, pointing out that
students who would give at home
can do as fine a work here in Da-
vidson and the surrounding com-
munities with their gifts.

Hines Program

Jerome Hines, whose concert to-
night opens Homecoming festivities,
has selected a program of classical,
religious, and modern compositions

jfor his waiting audience. ‘

Accompanied by Alexander
Alexay, the tall, big-voiced star of
Mephistopheles will sing six groups
of songs. Mozart's “Mentri, ti las-
cio,” the first presentation, will be
followed by selections from Wolf,
Strauss, and Beethoven. The third,
a special group of religious num-
bers, will include “The  [ord’s
Prayer,” by Molotte, “Agnus Dei,”
[by Boito, and a traditional Jewish
hymn “Eli, Eli.”

Hines then turns to “Son lo
(svirto from “Mephistopheles” by
Boito.

\
The remainder of the program

consists of three selections by the
French composers Ravel, Faure,
and Thomas; and a group of mod-

“She Walked in the Hand of My

Dreams,” written by Hines himself.

Cleveland Trophy, the highest
award a chapter can win, This
trophy, awarded by General Head-
quarters of Phi Delta Theta, is pre-
sented to the outstanding chapter
of iis class on the basis of high
scholarship, leadership and inter-
fraternity activities.

The Davidson chapter ‘leads the
list. of forty chapters in the smalt

first time, a chapter has won it

Oren Moore

To Be Honored

A highlight of the Alumni Con-
vocation tomorrow morning will be
the honoring of Dr. Oren Moore,
06, in a resolution from the Alum-
ni Association and written and read
by Dr. Ernest Beaty.

Until his death this sununer,
Dr. Moore was outstanding as one
of Davidson's most Joyal alumni.
As a member of the DBoard af
Trustees, past president of the
Alumni Association, and a member
of the Athletic Committee, he
served his alma mater well.

Particularly in athletics was Dr.
Moote close to the college. Always
identified by a bright red carnation
in his lapel, Dr. Moore never wit-
teased a football game from the
stands. He was always with the
team on the bench. One of the na-
tion's top genecologists and ob-
stetricians, Dr. Moore ranks as one
of the institution’s finest products.
Dr. Beaty, a long-time friend of
Dr. Moore is well qualified to pre-
sent the resolution. Wrote sports
editor Wilton Garrison in the Char-
lotte Observer, the repartee passed
between Moore and Beaty was “as
sparkling as the sunshine on Home-
coming Day.”
