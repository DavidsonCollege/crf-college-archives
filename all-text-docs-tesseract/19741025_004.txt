| Community-Wid Questions

By MARK WILENSKY agreed to arrange for the students to approach
Managing Editor the town committee charged with the
While it is apparent from recent news stories, _of land for future low rent housing.

editorials and letters that there exists a
housing shortage in Davidson, concrete action
has not yet been undertaken.

Numerous groups have taken on the problem
as something ‘‘to study.” At Monday night’s
town meeting, three committees referred to the
problem, with none advocating anything more
than further study.

The Community Relations Committee,
chaired by Charles Ratliff, the Downtown
Development Committee and the Planning
Board passed the problem back and forth. It
was continually pointed out by the committees
that necessary money exists, but that no

available land can be found.

THE DAVIDSONIAN contacted College
President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. about the
possibility of the’ college releasing some of its
land for sale to the town. Spencer indicated that
the college is considering the possibility of
releasing for sale some 100 acres of land. None
of the town committees have yet contacted the

college, a town’s largest landowner, to -
request the

purchase of land.

Mayor Tom Sadler met Tuesday with the two
students sponsoring last week’s SGA housing
resolution. Sadler reiterated the pointthat
money for low rent housing was available, and
that such a project was high on the list of town
priorities.

When asked about the progress of inquiries
into land purchases, Sadler indicated no
knowledge of any inquiries at all. Sadler poin-
sd oar tad Bay anit OWia Waid arid has been
neither a) for nor personally con-
sidered the selling of his land.

* At both the town and the meeting
with the students, Sadler expressed hope that
as “people of good will” Davidson would “ve

its housing problems in a positive way. \He

Student groups are also studying the housing
problem. The Eumenean society has spent it
last two meetings discussing pogsible action.
They have discussed the problem over lunch
with various student leaders, as well as with
Minister to Students Rush Otey and Town
Council member Nancy MacCormac. _

The group has considered petitioning the
town for a housing code (a move the SGA un-
sucessfully made last week) and also doing the
legwork necessary to relocate some of the
people living in the substandard areas. Otey led
a discussion on priorities in the housing area at
last Thursday’s lunch meeting.

The extent of the action on the housing
problem has come from the college. ‘‘Minor
‘Tepairs’”’ have been made, and the housing is
being upgraded. Three houses have been razed.

One employee of Davidson College whose
home was written of in the original DAVID-
SONIAN article, has aplied to move to
Lakeside, according to College Personnel
Director Robert J. Stephenson;-

“There have been people willing to move to
Lakeside and build homes,” Waymersaid. “‘The
college wouldn’t sell the land, claiming they
were saving it for employees. ‘“‘Not many
college employees who aren’t now living there
@ill be able to afford it,”” Waymer concluded.

Otey claimed that the college has indicated to
him that this policy may be changing. He cited
news media pressure as a reason for the
college’s change in its attitude concerning
Lakeside property.

Discussion continues, but quick action is not
anticipated. Mayor Sadler pointed out at the
town meeting that no action would be take until
the individuals concerned e their
desires. One of the two students at the meeting
claimed that ‘‘perhaps they just did.”

‘Servant Of Two Masters’

Opens New Drama

Season

By LYNNE KEENER
Staff Writer

‘The Servant of Two
Masters,” the drama depart-
ment’s first production of the
1974-75 season; Opens tnis
Wednesday in Hodson Hall.

The classic Italian comedy
will be presented for students
only Wednesday, with the
general public invited to per-
formances Thursday through
Saturday, according to
Professor of Rupert T.
Barber, the play’s director.

This 18th century comedy of
Carlo Goldini exhibits the
characters and techniques of
the ‘‘commedia del’ arte.”

The play is a complicated ;

tangle of disguises, mistaken
pia lost lovers, plots
and €ross plots, and “slapstick
humor.”

During , Homecoming
weekend, acrobats, jugglers
and costumed actors will
parade around the campus
muck like the original: com-
media troupes which travelled
from towh to town. Barber
said, ‘‘With carts loaded with
costumes and skimpy props,
they set up small stages in

streets or vacant lots, and per- §

formed with a great deal of ad
libbing.”’

Barber is pleased with the
way the actors are im-

provising to create an ‘earthy .

feeling.’”’ ‘“The students han-
dle the quality of the ‘com-
media del’ arte’ well,’”’ Barber
said.

“The servant in the title,
Tuffaldino, better known as
Harlequin, is the archetypical
clown—a lackey, a cunning but

inept fool,” Barber continued. |
“True to tradition, he preys on;
his betters and takes their
kicks to his pants.”

The stock characters are
masked. They include Scott
Reid. as_ stub old Pan-
talone; Frank Bencini as Truf-
faldino, the witty servant;
Graham Smith as Doctor
Lombardi, the comic scholar;
and Wayne Jonas as the in-
nkeeper, Brighella.

Drama professor Joseph T.
Gardner is designing sets

complete with a miniature
theatre wagon and old-
fashioned backdrops.
Professor Barber’s wife,
Carol, is designing period
costumes. Furthermore, with
student entertainment prior to
and during the performance,
the ab mood will evolve.

Other cast membes include:
Emilie Bryan, Sue Colan, Rick
Fay, Bill Holladay, Tony Mar-
tin, Wyndell Patterson, Frank
Rambo and Jayne Reich.
