On Oct. 2, after two years of
work, Davidson’s Board of Trust-
ees approved the Strategic Plan ini-
tiated by President Tom Ross at the
beginning of his presidency. The
plan had input from thousands of
students, faculty, staff, alumni, par-
ents and friends of the college.

This is not a regular enterprise
at Davidson, and when Tom Ross
arrived, no current plan was in pro-
cess; however, Ross recognized the
need for Davidson to “change in
order to remain the same.”

Davidson has a unique culture
with core values and traditions that
comprise the college’s identity.
These values include a focus on
teaching and learning, a commit-
ment to leadership and service and
an adherence to the reform tradi-
tion. The administration intends
to ensure that Davidson loses no
aspect of its traditional core phi-
losophy.

To preserve the integrity of
the college’s values, the Strategic
Plan seeks to gauge how the Da-
vidson environment has changed
over time. For example, research
now differs greatly from the re-
search measures of twenty years
ago. While the main focus of re-
search was once placed on finding
resources, the principle challenge
of contemporary research is to dis-

cover credible resources.

The strategic assessment allows
the college to interpret the current
state of Davidson’s academic and
social existence. It assists the col-
lege in evaluating the Davidson
culture and the needs of Davidson
students.

The strategic plan began on

being proactive about increasing

the primary focus of the Davidson
faculty should remain on teaching.

Survey participants also agreed
that Davidson’s central purpose

Last Friday night, students
and members of the commu-
nity gathered in Belk Arena

to see the fifth annual tip-off
of the men’s and women’s
basketball seasons. Events
included team competition
for “Davidson’s Best Dance
Crew,” as well as a 3-point
shootout and opening scrim-
mages. The seniors out-
stepped the competition,
winning the most applause
from the fans. On the men’s
side, Bryant Barr 10 claimed
first place in the 3-point
competition while Ashley

Lax ’11 won’s the women’s
shootout. The men’s team has
an intersquad scrimmage this

Convocation to honor students and alumni

KELLY WILSON
Staff Writer

Friday through Sunday this
week marks Davidson’s annual
Family Weekend, a formal invita-
tion to family members of current
Davidson students to experience
campus life through classroom vis-
its, athletic events, theatrical and
musical performances, and conver-
sations with faculty and staff.

Among the weekend’s major
events is Fall Convocation, which
will take place on Saturday at 10:30
a.m. in the Duke Family Perfor-
mance Hall in the Knobloch Cam-
pus Center. There will be a picnic
lunch following Convocation on
Chambers Lawn.

“Fall Convocation is an oppor-
tunity to celebrate the academic ac-
complishments of some of our stu-
dents and to recognize a member of
the faculty for exceptional teach-
ing,” President Tom Ross ’72 said.
“The Convocation is also the first
opportunity for seniors to march in
an academic processional in their
caps and gowns.”

While Ross will not be deliver-
ing a speech at Saturday’s Fall Con-
vocation, he will present an honor-

ary degree to President Emeritus
John Kuykendall ’59, who served
as president of Davidson College
from 1984 to 1997.

During his presidency, David-
son launched its Dean Rusk Inter-
national Studies Program and the
Medical Humanities Program. Un-
der Kuykendall’s supervision, the
College also completed a $160-mil-
lion campaign to fund the construc-
tion of the Baker Sports Complex,
the Belk Visual Arts Center, and six
upperclassmen apartments.

While he was a student at Da-
vidson, Kuykendall served as Stu-
dent Body President and was re-
sponsible for founding the Honor
Council. This year is the 100th
anniversary of a student-run honor
code at Davidson, hence the cam-
pus-wide Celebration of Honor
and Integrity and the timeliness of
Kuykendall’s honorary degree.

Recipients of several other
awards will also be announced at
the ceremony. The Alumni Service
Award will be presented to Will
Terry ’54, Dean of Students Emeri-
tus, for his generous service to the
College.

The Thomas Jefferson Award
recognizes outstanding personal in-

fluence on the college community, |
and teaching, writing, and schol-
arship that go beyond the call of
duty.

The College will also announce
recipients of the Goodwin Exxon
Service Awards, which were estab-
lished by Henry S. Goodwin of the
Class of 1930 and funded by the
Exxon Foundation. The awards are
presented annually to a sophomore,
junior and senior who exemplify
the highest standards of character,
good sportsmanship, friendliness
and consideration for others.

Other highlights of the weekend
include a legacy gathering spon-
sored by the Alumni Association
at the President’s House. There are
approximately 40-45 legacy stu-
dents in each class, and all students
who have at least one parent who is
an alumnus are invited.

“This is only the second year
we’ve done a Family Weekend
legacy event,” Peter Wagner °92,
Director of Alumni Relations, said.
“Last year was a huge hit, so we’ve
stuck with it.

“There is something very spe-
cial about the ‘sons and daughters
of Davidson’ entrusting their own
sons and daughters to us for the

four most important years of their
lives,” he continued. “Davidson
values every relationship that is
created here between students,
parents and friends, but there is
undeniably something particularly
special about the generational con-
nections that legacy families have
with Davidson.

“At these events, it’s so much
fun to watch the families come
together, to see alumni reunited
sometimes after many years apart —
all there because their children are
classmates at Davidson like they
were years before,” he said. The
turnout for the gathering is expect-
ed to be around 250 people.

This weekend’s cultural events
include the Davidson International
Association’s (DIA) Internation-
al Festival, which will be in the
Brown Atrium of the Alvarez Col-
lege Union from 12:00 to 3:00 p.m.
on Saturday.

“The International Festival is an
opportunity for Davidson’s inter-
national students, students whose
parents are not originally from
the U.S., students who have stud-
ied abroad, and even some parents
