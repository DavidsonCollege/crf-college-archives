Black Student Number Remains Low

Last year Howard Ramagli
conducted “A Study of the At-
_ titudes and Procedures Con-
cerning the Black Experience
at Davidson College."’ This fall
he presented his findings to the
faculty, and we have asked him
to write a commentary on his
study. A copy of his manuscript
can be found in the library's
Davidsoniana Room.

On May 5, 1972, the Davidson
College Trustees approved a
plan for coeducation. In 1968,
the Spencer commission stated
affirmatively that David—
son did not discriminate in ad-
missions on the basis of race,
color, or creed.

In September 1972, three

months alter the approval of
coeducation, Davidson has
enrolled 57 coeds and employed
a female admissions counselor.

In September 1972. some four
years after the Spencer Com-
mission's resolution, Davidson
has enrolled 21 black students
and has just recently employed
a black admissions counselor.

Why?

This question was put to me
by the black upper classmen as
they returned to begin a new
year. I had no concrete answer
to give them. I could quote
figures from an attitude study
which found positive attitudes
toward blacks on the part of
faculty, students, and ad-

ministration.

I could have cited the
problems that Davidson en-
counters recruiting high caliber
black students who could and
probably would go to schools
such as Harvard, Yale,
Howard, and Fisk.

I could have discussed studies
which pointed out the social
hardships a black student faces
when attending a predominan-
tly white institution.

But these students did not
need to be told of these things.
They were part of these ex-
periences. We had hashed over
these points before last year.
Perhaps they were hoping that
this year it would be different.

Coed Cartoon Brings Reply ;

Nixon’s Policies Analyzed

To The Editor:

I had originally written, in
response to Ms. Huntly’s suc—
cinct scathing article. However,
after discussing this matter
with several other students, I
decided that such a reply would
only widen the gap that - ap-
parently lies between her and
the majority of Davidson
students.

I came to the hopeful con-
clusion that her comments,
(and strong they were indeed)
rested entirely upon ignorance
of last year's slogans and car-
toon, namely the one featuring
a verile male Wild-Cat Stud-ent
with a caption reading ‘A
Davidson Man needs no In-
troduction."

I hope she will agree that last
week's complementary car-
toon, when viewed in this light,
held no chauvenistic overtones
or disrespect for our new coeds.
We've worked hard to make
women a part of this institution.

Hopefully, their years here
will be most profitable as well
as enjoyable. All we ask is an
equal amount of understanding.

To the Editor:

I could not believe my eyes
when I turned to the editorial
page of The Davidsonian (22
September p.4) last week and
saw the cartoon of the ‘‘David-
son Woman." It is undoubtedly
one of the most blatant exam-

es of human chauvinism |

ave seen in a long time.

Not only is the cartoon
humanist, but I also consider it
downright degrading to felines
everywhere.

The Davidson man is known
for his intellectual capabilities
rather than his physique. I am
only asking that the same treat-
ment be given to the cats of this
world.

Why is it then that cats in
your paper are pictured with
human qualities? And you even
have the nerve to portray the
catlike figure as female when
everyone knows that the female
is the inferior sex!

Sir, you are a cat owner's cad,
a leopard’s looby, and a pu—
ma’s petunia.

My cat is as intelligent as any
old woman here at Davidson
and I would appreciate your

treating him as such. Quit your
pussyfootin’.

To The Editor:
Rejoice, all red-blooded

American students who valian-
tly supported our great
President against the decadent
leftist freaks for McGovern. It
was a patriotic showing for the
red, white, and blue compared
to the embarrassing vote of the
men who profess to be our
educators and superiors.

It is a little disappointing to
note that we didn't quite reach
the national poll percentage of
61 percent for our President,
but we'll get another chance in
a few weeks to redeem this slip.
Meanwhile, men, we must
stand firm on our well-founded
convictions and reinstate our
man, ‘King Richard”.

Too many of us are “tricked”
into believing the deceiving lies
and contradictions inherent in
McGovern propaganda (his
program) Why should our hard-
working fathers have to start
paying taxes to support 6 per-
cent of the labor force for sitting
on their asses. They'll never go
to work if they get paid for
doing nothing. If the lazy
people, mainly black, would
just get ambitious and do some
work, they could move out of
the slums.

Every man has a chance to
move up in the free-enterprise
system, if he would only put his
mind to it. After all, is
organized labor is satisfied with
present wage and price control.
why should we complain?

You've got to admit. there's
nothing wrong with America:
it's a lot better than Com-
munism. Remember, ‘‘I'd

‘rather be dead than go red!" Be

glad we have the right to vote.
It's our duty to democracy to be
informed and intelligent voters.
It is important to keep bom-
bing the hell out of those Com-
mie-Gooks in North Vietnam to
keep the Thieu Regime in power
so the South Vietnamese people
can continue to live in freedom
and democracy. Don’t believe a
word about the “‘Thieu-
dictatorship” or dike-bombing.
or hospital bombing. or anti-
personnel bombs or that 200.000
Americans are stationed just
outside of South Vietnam.

You know how reliable army
figures usually are. The im-
portant thing to remember is:
Nixon's ending the war and he
said so. And in 1968 he said:
“Any President who has had
four years to end the war and
failed, does not deserve another
chance.” Men, we've got to
believe in our President, he
knows what he's doing.

Let’s talk some sense into
these misguided radicals. Just
don't listen to their phony,
idealistic, screwed-up
economics. It's our duty to God
and our country to keep
America a land of the Free and
home of the Brave with Liberty
and Justice for All!

think about it.

Care about it.

If you don't...who will?

Perhaps they were hoping
that they would not have to ex-
perience the alienation which
they felt last year. Or maybe
they are hoping that an attempt
would be made to solve those
problems of black social
alienation which they will have
to experience for four years.

Last year’s study of the black
experience at Davidson cannot
answer these inquiries. The
study is perhaps an exercise in
academic frustration, written
by a white (and the problems
that accompany being white).

This study presents and ex—
plores the problems that the
black student faces at David-
son. It presents possible
solutions to these problems, but
these solutions do not cover all
LA : .
of the possibilities available to
the college to help its black
students. ,

The three major areas that
the study encompasses are ad-
missions, curriculum, and
social life. Social life was the
most discussed of the three
areas, and the most crucial in
the eyes of the black students.

It is in the social life of the
college that the black students

seem to feel the most
alienation.
Recommendations for

solutions to the black student's
problems have come from the
study and from the Black
Student Coalition. How soon
these recommendations will be
acted on is not known.

However, any action the
college may take at this point
could be nullified by the present
state of affairs that exists bet-
ween the black students and the
security force. The study
showed on a paper and pencil
test, positive attitudes toward
blacks. Actions are more
telling of true racial climate,
and the present college actions
are not very positive.

From all appearances, there
is an underlying assumption

that all blacks on campus are
here to cause trouble. Thus we
must stop every black to ensure
that he is an official member of
the college community.

Then to assure that there are
no more mix-ups, we have the
black students meet with the
security force so that we can
point out the blacks who are our
‘‘good niggers’.

If white students have also
been stopped by the security
people, would it not be as logical
to have the security people
meet the white students? Or
aoes Davidson have two classes
of students?

Davidson has better solutions
to the problems of the black
students. They are perhaps lost
on the endless list of priorities
for improving the college.

Davidson's black students are
told one thing and experience
another. Is this the kind of
solution that Davidson has to of-
fer these students?

We need to resurrect these
solutions and put them into ac-
tion. If we don't, we face an
even more monumental task of
recruiting black students,
students who will hear that
Davidson has yet to put into ac-
tion the commitment that the
Spencer Commission made four
years ago.
