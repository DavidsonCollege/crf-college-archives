BOOK REVIEW

Twelve Against the Gods—William Bolitho, |
Simon and Schuster, New York, 1929.
“Twelve Against the Gods” is the story

of adventure. It considers that type of ad-

venture which has produced some of the
greatest characters in the history of man-
kind.

“To us of the white race,” writes Wil-
liam Bolitho, ‘‘the adventurer is the most
fascinating of our possibilities. Lucky and
accursed, we have the taint of adventure in
our blood. . . . In reality, the whole history
of human progress from the flint-jabber to
standing room in the subway .. . is the re- |
sult of two fornis of effort, the guard and
the search, made by the homestayer on the
one hand, and by the bold affronter of the
new on the other; that is, by the citizen and |
the adventurer.”

Bolitho takes the stand that the adventurer
is anti-social—that this is a part of his very |
nature. Perhaps he has carried this idea too |
far. However, when we examine the lives
of great adventurers, we see that there is
some very definite backing for the idea. In|
some it is more evident, and in others it |
is less. It is upon the all-inclusive side of his
statements with which we would argue.

In this study of adventure—and it is es-
sentially a study of adventure—Bolitho dis-
cusses twelve great characters. These char-

Cake Race Planned

For Frosh Nov. 7th

In order to get more Freshmen interested
in track and in athletics in general, the ath-
letic department has decided to establish here
at Davidson a traditional cake race. They
feel that a great many boys have the ability
to run and yet don’t realize this ,ability.
Through the cake race, it is hoped that such
persons will discover their ability, or at any
rate become interested in some form of ath-

jletic sport. These cake races will be held

annually for the Freshmen and a large num-
ber of candidates is expected to turn out.
Fifteen or prizes will be
from

more
ranging anywhere
checks,

awarded,
neckties to soda

The cake race here this year will take place
on November 7, and it is hoped that every
Freshman not out for football or not physi-
cally disabled will participate. Men are urged
to come out now and begin getting their
legs in shape for the two or two and one-
half mile course that will start at the sta-
dium, go to the fourth tee on the golf course,
then will follow the road leading to the
Concord road, and will take the Concord
road back to the stadium.

A glider club, membership of which will
be limited to about 24 undergraduates, has
been formed on the campus of Carleton Col-
lege at Northfield, Minn.

Dr. William F. Peirce, president of Ken
yon College, has entered a sanitarium at

Washington, Pa., to recuperaté from an ap-
pendix operation undergone in August. He
plans to take a vacation at Hot
Springs, Va., before resuming his duties at
Kenyon in December.

What this country needs is more of us

with the courage to say “yes” when fools

ask: “What's the matter, are you afraid ?”—
Collier's editorial.

There are lots of people who committed
crimes during the year who would not have
done so if they had been fishing —Herbert

Hoover.

acters are: Alexander the Great—the adven-

ture of youth and how philosophy tamed it;
Casanova—he who went furtherest into the |
forbidden country of extremes; Columbus— |
who proved that everything is true, if you
believe it; Mahomet—the bloody hunt for |
heaven; Lola Montez—the only adventure |
woman of the past could live; Cagliostro |
(and Saraphina)—the search for a phantom;
Charles XII of Sweden—and danger as an
ideal; Napoleon I—the only reason for Wa-
terloo ; Cataline—the rich young racketeer of
Rome; Napoleon I1I—the living serial: con-
sequences of the situation; Isadora Duncan—
the dance of life on a tight-rope strung over |
Europe, and Woodrow Wilson—single com- |
hat.

Bolitho permeates his writing with his |
personality—both brilliant lights on the |
horizon of a rather dull period. He might |
easily be called an adventurer—I hope we |
may use a different meaning from his.

Case-Reserve Merger |

Not to Be Complete |

Cleveland, Ohio—(1P)—Spurning a point-
ed suggestion of the Reserve Weekly that
the Case and football teams be
combined, in keeping with the spirit of aca-
demic co-operation recently announced for |

Reserve

the two institutions, whose campuses join
here, the Case Tech couched its reply in|
the following terms: |

“If football is first and last a municipal
spectacle, let's merge and be quick about
it. If it is a campus sport, part of a pro-
gram of ‘every man play his own game,’
why not stay in the Ohio Conference, where
some good frtignds, Oberlin and Wooster
among them—are working with us to ad- |
vance these ideals? Why not?”

Reserve, a traditional enemy of Case on
the football field, has practically deserted
the Ohio Conference of late years, in an
effort to bring “big time’ football to Cleve- |
land. As a consequence she has taken terrific |
wallopings from Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh,
and similar teams of national strength. |

Case has continued to keep its schedule |
mostly in the Ohio Conference, and looks |
this year to beat Reserve rather decisively. |

them, the Evangelistic Scriptures.” , |

Mr. Rimmer also quoted from Tatian’s
Diatesseron. Says Tatian, “While I was giv- |
ing my most earnest attention to this mat- |
ter, I happened to meet with certain bar- |
baric writing too old to be compared with
the opinions of the Greeks, and too divine
to be compared with their errors. I was
led to put faith in these by the unpretend- |
ing cast of the language, the inartificial char-
acter of the writers, and the foreknowledge
displayed of future events, the excellent qual-
ity of the precepts, and the declaration of
the government of the universe as centered
in one being.”

“The science of archeology has also found
that people living in the early Christian era_|
used in addition to the papyri, bits of broken |
pottery for writing material,” said Mr. Rim- |
mer. “Many of these have been unearthed
which bear upon them quotations from the
Scripture.” |

In closing, Mr. Rimmer made an appeal |
to Davidson men to keep their faith in the |
Bible and to believe in it without reserva- |

tion.
