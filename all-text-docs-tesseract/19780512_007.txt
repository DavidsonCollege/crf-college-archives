NCAA’s ahead?

Bondy ends brilliant career

By LISA JOHNSON
and
JAY GEPFERT
Staff Writers

It is time to pay tribute to
one of Davidson's finest and
most intense athletes, Chip
Bondurant. In his four years at
Davidson, one spent in Mont-
pellier, he has excelled in num-
erous athletic activities, but he
is most well known for his
outstanding performance on the
Davidson tennis team. Bon-
‘durant has helped guide the
team to at least three winning
seasons and has himself com-
piled an impressive winning
record.

Bondurant came to Davidson

_from Winter Park High School

in Florida where he played
tennis and basketball. His
freshman year he played num-
ber two for the Cats and
finished with a 10-10 season.

The following year as a
sophomore, Chip occupied the
top notch on the team and
terminated his 1976 season at
number one with a record of
13-14.

Bondurant decided to partici-
pate in the Junior Year Abroad
Program in Montpellier, France
the next year, so the team lost
“Cheep”’ to the French tennis
courts. He won several tourn-
aments while in Europe and
returned to Davidson ready to
go again.

The spring of 1978 epitomizes
the outstanding tennis record of
Bondurant at Davidson. Play-
ing the number two position for
the Cats, he was an extremely
consistent winner and never lost
a conference match. During the
season he dropped a mere three
matches and they were to
UNC-CH, N C State, and
USC.

His intensity continued in-
to the
tournament,

referred to as ‘‘Mooselle”’ by

Chip. Together they developed
into a dynamite doubles team,
playing number one for David-
son, and compiling a. 14-6 record
for the season.

Gepfert and Bondurant won
the Southern Conference by
downing Booth and McWaters
of the Citadel, 7-5, 6-2 in the
finals on Saturday.

Coach Jeff Frank, in com-
menting on Bondurant, said
that he never had a bad match
and consistency was the name
of his game. Bondurant is so
mentally tough, as well as tal-
ented, that Frank said he would
eveh bet his Jaguar on almost
anybody Bondurant played.

Bondurant is Known also for
his sportsmanship and Coach
Scarpa of Furman recognized
Babb and Bondurant as the
outstanding gentlemen and
sportsmen of the 1978 tourna-
ment.

Along with tegnis,

ve CSOT

Bondur-

ant has participated in various
IMAC sports at Davidson. He
played flickerball for the Bongs,
basketball for the SAE’s .and
even mariaged to squeeze in a
few volleyball and softball
games this spring.

He also is a member of the
marching ROTC crew, a French
major and a member of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fratern-
ity, the source of his incessant
social activity. He can generally
be found on the west end of
Davidson, near the tennis
courts or on the first floor of the
library, signing autographs for
friends.

The immediate future for
Bondurant points towards the
army, so look out tank drivers
and clear the courts, because
Bondy’s on the way. Bondurant
received a well-deserved stand-
ing ovation on Monday night at
dinner and we join the SAF’s in
praising him for his fine perfor-
mance at Davidson.
