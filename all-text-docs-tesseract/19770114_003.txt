Students encouraged
to participate

The new Davidson College Constitution calls
for the formation of a Media Board to govern
Student publications. This board consists of
three student members chosen by the SGA
Senate, three members chosen by the adminis-
tration and faculty, and three members chosen
by these six.

The SGA has approved a selection process
for the choosing of the three student members.
One member will be chosen by the Media and
two by an open process.

Students interested in the Media at Davidson
College are encouraged to apply for the Media
Board positions. Pick up an application in the

Dean of Students Office, and return it there by
Friday, January 14.
