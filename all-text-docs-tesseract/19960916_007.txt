Contagious?

The first time

Why is first night down often confused for first time down?

First time to gratify the impulse to lose control and to drink to the point of
vomiting. Let the frenzied rhythms of music and bodies invade and overcome. No
curfew, no rules, (not many if any). Free reign, free beer, freedom. No mother or
father to ask hg “Where are you going, when will you be home, whose house, whose

car?”

First night to party hard? Maybe not.

But first night at Davidson, with

upperclassmen, freshmen, and anyone else seeking the ultimate weekend experi-

ence? Yes. The first time..
Andis it first night to lie face down pressed into your bed with your hand behind :

your back, naked and scared? First time for terror? First realization that Davidson

isn’t a tourbook Utopia?

They say to move in packs. Take friends. Look out for each other. These are
the warnings. These are not mom’s warnings, these are the words of the terrified,
broken girl pressed face down into her bed. They are the warnings of the half-
conscious girl too weak to struggle. They are the warnings of the sober girl who
volunteered to take care of a drunken stranger.

Excessive drinking and partying, newfound freedom and “friendships” spell
rape for unsuspecting Davidson women each year on their first night down. There
are no statistics; there are only stories — stories told the next morning in tears to a
roommate, or revealed to a friend over a beer a couple of weeks later, or confessed
to a qualified professional in the first of ten free counseling sessions, or performed
four years later to an audience of hundreds at Take Back the Night.

Or perhaps there is no story to tell at all, just a hangover and homework that goes
unfinished that weekend. We hope so.

The Court is not necessarily a place to avoid or to tip-toe through with your
trusty 911 alarm in hand. But it is not a place to stumble into blindly either.

To the Editors:

In response to Joseph
Hayworth’s article entitled
“Safety or Tradition?” I
would like to make the fol-
lowing remarks. First, I am
shocked to find that some-
one who chose an instution
of higher learningbased on
the ambiance of doors can
actually write a complete
sentence, let alone an entire
article. I guess that it should
not surprise me that this same
person finds the marginal
benefits of increased safety
and peace of mind out-
weighed by the marginal cost
of loss of tradition by in-
stalling CAT-card accessible

ued ares

locks on the doors of Cham-
bers. But this does surprise
me,

I find your “solution” to
the issue of safety even more
absurd than your initial ar-
gument. Do you really think
that self-defense classes are
sufficient to protect all stu-
dents on campus from exter-
nal threats? Following your
line of logic, we should also
take the locks off the dorms
and all rooms as long as ev-
eryone knows how to knee
an assailant in the groin prop-
erly. There is absolutly no
reason for any student who
is even remotely concerned
about safety to object to the

ee a

new security measures.

I had been told that the
Students made the decision
regarding the locks, If this is
the case, youcould have been
part of the “‘powers-that-be”
that you referred to in your
article. By stating your case
to the appropriate council,
your argument could have
made a difference. Being so
new on campus, I guess we
really cannot blame you.

I hope I never have to
read one of your articles
again. I also hope never to
come into contact with you
in case whatever you have is
contagious.

The man looked angry I
thought. Very angry as a

matter of fact. Browsing the -

racks at the Little Professor
store in Corneluis, I won-
dered what had happened.
Someone was in trouble.
Would I ever find out? It
turned out that I found out
more than I needed to know.

“Why did you hit my
car?” he snarled behind me.
I spun around startled, and
found myself staring into
bloodshot eyes.

“Huh?” I queried.

“You hit my car!!!” he
screamed.

“What are you talking
about?” I asked, perplexed.

“You hit my car in the
lot” he yelled again. “She
saw you do it” he raged,
pointing at a middle aged
woman behind him.

“Yep, I sure did,” she
nodded.

“Yeah we saw you too “
agreed another couple com-
ing into the store behind
them. More people poured
into the store, all agreeing
loudly that I was infact the
dastardly villain responsible
for damaging this poor man’s
car.

“And You expect me to
believe that all these people
are lying?” ranted the man.
“They SAW you, and they

are ALL lying. Why?”

I turned desperately to
the bookstore staff to pro-
vide an alibi (I had been in-
side for quite a while), and
found that they had chosen
this precise moment to con-
vene an Annual General
Meeting on the other side of
the store. I began to feel like
the accused in a Western
when he peers out of the cell,
sees the lynch mob outside,
and finds the bobbling
sherriff has grabbed his hat
and headed out the back door
to inspect distant parts. -

Ultimately I managed
to shout my way out of the
rabble of suburbanites, and
emerged shaken but other-
wise unharmed from the in-
cident. It did however set
me thinking. In a court of
law, with so many witnesses,
I would have been convicted.
I could drag in a protesting
Brian (my roommate and
chauffeur) to testify that I
never drove cars or shoved
carts around, but a jury
would laugh him out of court.
Matter of fact, I began to
wonder how so many people
could have claimed to seen
me do something which I
notonly knew Ihad notdone,
but could not possibly have
done, (seeing as how I do
not drive, at least in
America). I even found my-
self wondering if I could

possibly have done it un-
awares, before the absurdity
of the whole thing became
clear.

What am I trying to say ~
here? Just this: sometimes,
it is just possible that when
“the accused” protests their
innocence, they just might
be telling the truth. There is
a reason why “innocent till
proven guilty” is an accepted
legal principle. While a ju-
dicial process may be clear '
and fair, people can and do
fall through the flaws in “‘the
system.”

If you follow the court
system at all (and no, OJ
don’t count) you are prob-
ably aware of some famous
miscarriages. The Marine
officer just released after 19
years, accused by his wife of
beating her into a coma and
murdering their children,
freed because of DNA evi-
dence. (The former wife,
now remarried, has not been
charged with any crime). Six
black men in Ohio out after
15 years of protesting their
innocence for a crime they
did’ nt committ. Many child
abuse cases — the modern
counterparts to the Salem
Witch Trials. And other
tragic cases.
