FENCING? No, rather it’s a bold defensive lunge during

flickerball action this week.

IMAC flickerball play

By THE
BODACIOUS TA-TA’S

Is it a SPE rush party? AY
re-enactment of the peanut-
popping, teeth-gnashing Car-
ter-Ford debate? A chimpan-
zee party with a single ban-
ana? A Pre-Cambrian Can-
aanite sacrificial ritual?

No, it’s merely an outburst
of flickerball mania that is
rampaging throughout the
campus, a phenomenon that
reduces normal, healthy Dav-
idson students to bumbling
idiots.

The first evident outbreak
occurred on field #7 as Porky
Pig routed SPE #2 18-13.

With thirty seconds remain-
ing, and SPE #2 on top 13-12,
Jim ‘‘Turkey’’ Wood turned
sideways propelled a five yard
punt out of bounds to give
Porky Pig the ball on the SPE
#2 23 yard line. The Pigs
squealed in delight as Profes-
sor Shi grunted and threw the

winning pass on the next play.
Another outbreak was ob-

served as Off Again came on é

again to bludgeon the Base-
ment Bangers 32-7.

Off Again will most likely
have an undefeated season.

The utterly disgusting Dog-
gie Style took on Pika in a
battle of the unbeatens. Led
by the dynamic Cory Young
and Speed Burner ‘‘Bowie’’
Andrews, Doggie style show-
ed a definite lack of couth as
they came out on top, 61-7.

Of course, the perenially
putrid Pika team is no stran-
ger to the bottom.

While Gang Bang was busy
Wednesday afternoon, PDT
#1 thoroughly emulsified them
57-0. Maybe next time Gang
Bang will turn their attention
to the game, at the risk of

losing crowd turnout.
That controversial team of

old, the Whizz Kids, once

again took advantage of a
freshman hall while sputtering
past 3rd Richardson 44-38.

Mike Knowles’ brilliant fly
patterns (who is Carroll Ens-
sley?) lent respectability to a
Whizz Kids offense that will
do anything to win.

PDT #3 wilted and set the

sun as SAE #1 fried the lifeless |

willies 52-0. The remnants of
PDT #3 can be observed in the
invertebrate section of the
Biology museum.

Moving on to the lighter |

side of life, we found only one
encounter involving young
lasses.
