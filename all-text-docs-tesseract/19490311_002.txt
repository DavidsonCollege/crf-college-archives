Rumor has it that next fall the faculty

A good many of the calls that come in are
important, some are emergencies. Most of the
people who call the dormitories have some
reasonable facsimile of a purpose for calling ;
it is reasonably safe to say that few of the
calls are of the party-line gossip variety.

So not only from the viewpoint of eliminat-
nuisance, but’ also a matter of

There are enough boys in school who could
use this added help so that a monitor could

A Course In Marriage

For the past several years at Davidson
there has heén some demandefor the addition
of a course in marriage and the family to
our curriculum, In recent years, the psychol-
ogy department bas not been fully enough
staffed for such a course to be offered. How-
‘ever, with two good men in that department,
now is the time for the students once again
to show an interest in it if they would like to
see it installed,

One of the inajor problems that faces our
nation and our Church today is the problem
of marriage and divorce. It is eommon knowl-
edge that our divorce rate is rising annually,
an indication.that our people are either not
taking marriage seriously, or that they are
poorly equipped to meet the problems that
it presents.

If the home is to be preserved, it is up to
the Church and the people of the Chureh to
put marriage back on a firm foundation.
Davidson men, who will be the leaders, both
as ministers and as laymen, in the Church of
the future, should have some knowledge of
the fundamentals of the institution.

Now, of course, just-to ask what the prob-
lems of marriage are and how to solve them
intelligently may not be the solution to our
high ‘divorce rate and the instability of mar-
riage, but surely it is a step in the right di-
rection, a step that Davidson men ought to
take.

With the exception of certain tropical
honey wasps, all wasps feed on animal food
—usually other insects.
