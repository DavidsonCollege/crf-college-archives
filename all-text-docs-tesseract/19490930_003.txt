It wasn’t until near-
ly mid-day that the
sun broke through the
overcast skies at West
Point last weekend, but
once the sky hed
cleared, the sun kept
shining and assured
the throng of fans
gathered for the David-. ,
son-Army football.
game of an ideal day
for the contest. The
majority of the fans
were late filing into
the stands due to the ¢
dress parade that the
eorps of Cadets was
staging on the parade ground which is some distance from
Michie Stadium.

Of the nearly 30,000 football enthusiasts present, approxi-
mately 10,000 of them were Boy Scouts who had been issued a
special invitation to the game. The Cadets were seated, below
the press box and took up a large portion of the west side of
the stands. Davidson supporters were across the field, and the
aumber of fans present to urge on the Red and Black was sur-
prising, to say the least. About four car loads of students were
oy hand from Davidsen and many alumni, now in Penn Med

. Sehool, made the trip for the zame. Who the others were, we
aon't know, but there was certainly a sizable group that let
out a whoop every time the Cats leoked good.

GOOD COVERAGE OF GAME

Press, radio and television coverage was the best obtainable.
NBC sent their portable TV equipment to. the vame and tele-
sed the entire scrap under the sponsorship of Lucky Strike
vigarettes. Ted Husing brought a play by play description of
the action via radios but it wasn't on a nation-wide huok-up
Reporters from some of the big New York newspapers were on
hand to write up the game us well as other writers from
widely scattered papers. Our own Ju Thigpen had a front row
seat in the press box to record a play by play account of the
game. With Jo-Jo was Buddy Cheek who was one of the alunini
up from Penn Med Sehool.

The Cadet cheering section was really something to see
and hear. Not only were the plebes velling their heads off, but
the leather-lunged upperelassmen were all trving to out-vell
exch other. With such spirit as the corps has, it is easy to
understand the part they have played in helping Army to win
over 140 games at Michie Stadium while losing only 8. The
famous mule mascots of the Cadets added to the color of the
gzame. During intermission a special veremony was held to re-
tire from ‘service’? Mr. Jackson, one of the mites, who has
had scores of différent cheerleaders on his back down through
the veurs, An honor guard placed a horseshoe of flowers around
his neck while the Army band slowly played ‘‘The Old Grey
Mare She Ain’t What She Used To Be.’’

RUNYAN BULLS ACROSS

Davidson received the kick-off and got off to a red-hot
start. Tailback Lambeth spread the Cadet line with &-coyple
of well aimed tosses and then C. L. Runyan bulled his/way
through the center of the line for ten-vards to salt awax the
second Cat first down. On the next play, a Lambeth pass Was
intercepted, but the Cats had gotten off to » good start. Army
worked the ball down field and scored after approximately: six
minutes of the first quarter. Davidsen had trouble the next time
they got the ball. Runyan, attempting to kick from his own goal
line was charged hard by Army's massive forward wall and
Captain John Trent pounced on it for the second Cadet TD,
only two minutes after the first one.

Army’s power prevailed until. the opening of the second
period. Then a fumble by Jim Cain on the Army 17 set up the
Wildcat score. Lambeth picked up four on a run and Turner
passed to Price on the three-yard line. Turner and Runyan
failed to crash the ball over on the next two plays, hut then
C. L. carried across on the next play from scrimmage. Davidson's
scoring was over for the afternoon, but more than one or two
“oohs’’ and ‘‘ahs’’ were heard around the press box when the
scoreboard showed Army 13, Davidson 7.

Too Much for Cats

By DAN McKEITHAN

In the opening game of the foot.
ball season, Davidson College’s
Wildcats went out of their section
of the country and ont of their
class to encounter the mighty West
Point Cadets. Although the fa-
vorites ran up an expected 47-7
score, there were some enlightening
statistics which give a truer picture
of the contest. The boys from the
South ate up a gross total of 277
yards, net of 233, against a team
which is known for its stout de-
fense. Another revealing fact is
that the losers rang up 16 first
downs to Army’s 14. The majority
of Davidson's gains came on for-
ward passes with Auburn Lam-
beth on the throwing end much of
the time.

After the Keydets had scored
twice in the first period on a 46-
yard march and a blocked punt, the
fighting Wildcats came back
strong. They drove all the way to
the Army 18, but it was a recovery
of a fumble on the 15 that set up the
lone Davidson score. Hard-driving
C. L. Runyan crashed over from
one yard out and after Hal Mapes’
conversion the. score stood 13-7,
Army leading.

However, at this point, Army
really began rolling. Heralded Gil
Stephenson scored his second TD,
followed by two pay.off tosses
from Quarterback Arnold Galiffa,
potential all-American. The scor-
