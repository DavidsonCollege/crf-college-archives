4 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Now is the spending season
on college campuses around the
country, as students purchase text-
books, notebooks, supplies for the
room, etc. And at Davidson many
students purchase these items with
the declining balance on their Cat
cards. But not many students are
aware of the $10 service charge
associated with depositing money
in their accounts.

The first deposit of each aca-
demic year carries with it the $10
surcharge (upcharge). According
to Director of Auxiliary Services
Richard Terrry, the upcharge cov-
ers “labor and other administrative
costs.”

The Campus Network, the
linking of the different services on
campus through the Cat card, is a
computer system which Davidson
leases through an outside company.

The Campus ‘Network rents
the phonelines used to carry the
information on the card and the
electronic readers which process
the information at acost of $30,000
a year. Additionally, says Terry,
the his department has to pay two
full-time salaries.

Tohelp offset the cost of oper-
ating the network several revenue-
generating steps are taken. First,
there is the $10 upcharge for the
first deposit of the year into a
student’s account. Also, the other
servers connected to the Cat card
pay a fee to the Campus Network.

The other services connected
to the Cat card are the laundry, the

Commons, the Outpost, the Union
Café, Baker Underground, and the
Bookstore. Each electronic reader
(the machine they slide the. card
through) is rented to the server at
the Campus Network’s cost of
$1,000.

Each server also also returns
one percent of the value of declin-
ing balance purchases to the Cam-
pus Network. According to Terry,
the Commons pays “a very big
cut” of the operational expenses of
the network.

Despite gaining revenue from
these sources, Terry says his office

still does “not break even.”

Students could avoid paying
the service charge by putting
money onto their cards in May
intending to use it for the next year.
But Terry says there is a trade-off
involved in making such a move
because, while a student avoids the
charge, he ties up his money from
May to September.

If a large number of students
began depositing money during one
academic year in preparation for
the next to avoid paying $10, Terry
says that his office would be forced
to look for other ways of meeting
their operating costs.

Terry mentioned the policy at
Duke, which requires all students
to make a minimal deposit into
their declining balance accounts.

He also stressed that he is not
threatening students with a change
in policy but alerting them of the
reality of the situation.

Terry says that the college does
not fund the Campus Network from
the general pool of funds because

it is unfair to charge non-users for
a convience used only by: some
students. Currently, there are 820
students with accounts holding five
dollars or more. :

“ Moststudents are unaware that
the service charge even exists.
Terry empathizes with students
when they feel angry about the
charge, but again says that declin-
ing balance is a trade-off.

Students pay $10 not to have
to carry cash around campus. If
they feel the charge is too great
compared to the convience a de-

clining balance account affords,
they ought not have an account.

Terry also says it is in the best
interest of the College that stu-
dents maintain accounts because it
will mean that they will spend
money on campus.

“We’re trying to provide a
system that is convienent and en-
courages students to spend money
at campus sites,” says Terry.

Terry views the Cat card as a
“symbiotic relationship” in which
both parties benefit.

Terry is also working on a

plan to allow students to use their
CatCards off campus.

He stresses that the plan is still
in a very formative stage. “If we
do something, it will certainly be
regarded as an experiment.”

, Terry mentioned Domino’s as
being very interested in the idea.

_ - Terry states that logistical and
legal questions need to be resolved
before a plan can be implemented.
“We will proceed carefully,” says

Terry.

Web

from page |

CSC records indicate over
1,200 people view the Davidson
page each day, and that number is
climbing. Most mail received has
been from alumni excited about
the presence of Davidson on ‘the
Internet. Gradually, though, the
responses from prospective stu-
dents and their parents are increas-
ing, and that, according to
Stockdale, is one of the primary

goals of the program.

While publicity and improved
communication with alumni are
two major benefits, Davidson stu-
dents will profit from it as well.
Senior and World Wide Web
Server Consultant Chris Edwards
foresees the Web page becoming
the primary source for student in-
formation. He expects that a full
sports schedule, a limited student
and faculty directory, and other
such references should soon be on
the Web.

Students can get the full Web
experience in any computer lab or
at any computer in Chambers, all

of which have been adapted to use
graphics-oriented Web browsers,
From their dorms students need
only type “lynx  http://
www.davidson.edu” at a POL-
LUX> prompt to read the text as-
sociated with Davidson’s home

page.

Edwards, along with others
who have worked to establish the
link, is hopeful that more will take
advantage of this opportunity to
communicate with the outside
world. “I’dlike to see more depart-
ments get on the page,” Edwards
says. “Most of the stuff on there
now is catalog text.”

varied. Sophomore Sally Cobey
feels uneducated about the policy.
“Treally wish I could read a copy of
the new policy,” she says. Senior
Terri Gordon agrees: “I just don’t
understand it.”

Others don’t have a problem
with it. Says Shames, “I heard one
senior say that she would rather
have a wristband on than have a
stamp on her hand that won’t rub

off for days.”

Senior Lexy DeVane, how-
ever, is concerned with the pros-
pect of the Court being viewed as a
place for only people who drink.
“T don’t doubt the wisdom of the
PCC nor do! want to speak hastily,
but one of the reasons I came to
Davidson was because Patterson
Court was marketed as being a
very open environment. I really
feel like this policy will alienate
people from the Court and sepa-
rate the student body.”

Future Changes

“We will be constantly ex-
ploring the possibilities for im-
proving our risk management
policy — the strengths and weak-
nesses” says Shames. “Ideas in-
clude giving students a completely
separate Patterson Court ID card,
having a different background
color for the picture, and finding
other sources of funding (possibly
even the student activities fee) but
because of timing last spring these
simply weren’t feasible options.
We will, however, continue to im-
prove.”
