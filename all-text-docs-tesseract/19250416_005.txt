Wit and Humor Galore
in Old-Time Minstrel

Saturday Night Entertainment Fea-
tured by Junior Speaking Play

“The Follies of 1926" presented by the
Junior class during Junior Speaking was
staged last Saturday night at the Gym
jby a real old time minstrel.
|strel was a complete exhibition of wit
jand humor, interspersed with solos to
‘give the audience time to recover from
| the side-splitting laughter.
| As the curtains were pulled the open-

jing chorus, “All About Girls,” was sung |

jby the gentlemen of the minstrel en-
}semble, and this was concluded with a
I volte by Ed Wilson.

Having finished the opening chorus
the interlocutor, Hayden Hollingsworth,
introduced “Sambo,” the Salutatorian,
impersonated -by Flake Laird, who in
his characteristic comical style welcom-
ed the audience with bits of humor which
immediately brought every into the
spirit of all the fun,

Following “Sambo’s” banterings with
interlocutor, Woodrow Wilson rendered
the very touching solo: “When You and
|I Were Seventeen.”

| Smith, gave a concentrated dissertation

on “Condensed Milk,” after which he
| demonstrated rate ability_in. putting ov-
er several jokes. Then Fred sang “Hot
| Tamale Molly,” much to the amusement
| of the listeners.

As the applause for “Hot Tamale Mol-
ily” died away the interlocutor introduced
\“Tobe,” the class poet, impersonated by
'Colin Murchison, who read the Class

“Pome,” funny because of its ridiculous- |

ness.

The reading of Class “Pome” was fol-
lowed by the solo, “Show Me the Way,”
sung by Frank Hudson. :

| Next, “Jethro,” impersonated by Harl-
|lee Branch, presented the Class Gift in
such a humorous way that none but the
| deaf could have resisted laughing.

| Now the above named endmen prophe-
| cied concerning the future prognosti-
{cations of each other with no tess humor
than characterized the other parts which
| was enormous and ridiculous. ;

| To conclude the program Piggy Mar-
tin sang “Oh Mabel” and on the chorus
the entire minstrel joined in and then—
the curtain.

The cast was as follows: Interlocutor,

S. C.; Margaret Walker, Farmville, Va.;/

The Min- |

Next “Bones,” impersonated by Fred |

up with the supervision of Professors
| Fleagle and Goldiere, will be equally in-
teresting. They will include: a musical
program, plays, and a feature act by
two Mexican dancers.

| Don't overlook the fact that the Queens
igirls will be to take part in the program.
| Everyone turn out to hear them! You
{won't regret it.

Watch our Spanish department !—it is,

lunquestionably becoming the livest in the
| state.

The will twenty-five
cents, a probable sacrifice in the pro-

admission he

jceeds, in order to give everybody the
{chance to take it in.
