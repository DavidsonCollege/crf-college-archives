College Cancels This Year’s Rush

By RICHARD WILSON

Asst. Managing Editor

The Davidson College
Board of Trustees voted Fri-
day to maintain a social sys-
tem of small groups accord-
ing to the principles of af-
filiation and equal participa-
tion in all activities on a
self-selection basis.

The board did, say, how-

ever, that national fraterni-
ties may stay on campus as
long as they conform. to
these principles.

“Weare not” abolishing
fraternities," said College
President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. after the meeting.
“They may remain, in fact
we hope they will stay, as
long as they adhere to these

Self-Exams
Approved

By GRAY WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor

The proposal for self-sched-
uled exams passed its last
administrative obstacle by
a faculty vote of 45-26 a week
ago last Tuesday and will be
instituted in the winter-term.

Student Senate President
Ran Coble hailed its passage
as ‘‘an example of the fact
that student government can
work; I am encouraged by
the initiative capacity of the
faculty.”

Vice President for Acade-
mic’ Affairs John M. Bevan,
chairman of the Educational
Policy Committee (EPC), pre-

(See SELF, Page Two)

is ‘remembered by most
alumni over a long period
of time as one of the really

significant personalities of
the. college.”’
The trustees .also_ desig-

nated the old Carolina Inn
next to the post office for
renovation and use by the
Honors College. Spencer an-

nounced a $50,000 grant from

the Surdna Foundation of
New York would be’used for
that purpose.

He: said a total of $80,000
would be needed for a com-
plete renovation, so work
would not begin until the
remaining $30,000 could be
raised.

After renovation the jinn
will house offices for the
Honors College dean and his
secretary, a lounge, dining
room ‘and kitchen, seminar
rooms and a bedroom suite
for special guests of the
Honors College.

The trustees did not’ give
final consideration to the
proposed recomposition of
the board. That measure is
now slated for action at the
trustees’ spring meeting on
campus.

standards,”’

The board outlined the fol-
lowing policy:

“1. The college will con-
tinue to make available the
present fraternity houses in
Patterson» Court for small
group dining, social and ex-
tra-curr:cular—purposes,

“2. After a possible _ jini-
tial period ,of random selec-
tion, affiliation with the
sroups occupying the houses
will be based on the choice
of the individual rather than
on . invitation— from — the
groups.

As a part of the phas-
ing process into the new ar-
rangement, which will go
into effect in September
1971, there will be no ‘rush
supervised by the college
during the current academic
year for fraternities occupy-

ing houses’ on Patterson
Court.

“4. The college will as-
sume responsibility in Pat-
terson Court for financial

obligations incurred prior to
the current academic year
by any fraternity chapter
which wishes it to do so, pro
vided that accounts receiv-
able are also turned over to
the college,

“5. The college will .as
sume responsibility for fur
nishing the houses in Pat-
terson Court. (It is proposed
that the college put into a
Furnishings Fund an amount
equivalent to the »rofession-
ally appraised value of the
furnishing of any fraternity
willing to leave its furnish-
ings in the house for curt
rent use,

“A chapter not wishing to
enter into this arrangement
would have the privilege of
disposing of its fupniinre as
it wishes.

“In the case where debts
are’ owed to the college or
where the college assumés
outstanding financial obliga-
tions of a fraternity, such
amount would be applied to-
ward a settlement involving
the furnishings.)

“6. That any fraternity
wishing ‘to continue ‘opera-
tion on Patterson Court in
‘accordance with the above

. principles of affiliation and

equal participation in all ac-.
tivities on a_- self-selection
basis will be able to retain
the house it now occupies.
“7. Any fraternity which
wislion: to leave Patterson

“Court and have its meetings

elsewhere may do so, so long
as its meeting place ...does
not include the operation
of living or dining facilities.”’

Both Spencer and Warner
L.’ Hall, board chairman,
hope that Davidson will
‘lead in a new type of fra-
ternity affiliation.."’

Genetic Would Ban
Selective Houses

By JEFF ALLENDER
Staff Writer °

Calling for ‘‘an immediate
change jin the social sys
tem,”’ the student senate
‘Monday night recommended
keeping national fraternities
which agree to operate on a
nonselective basis and con-
stituting nine houses as eat-
ing clubs. —

Juniors Cecil Burney, Dan-
ny Clodfelter and sophomore

Robert’ Dawson led the fight “

for the acceptance of the
Proposals, according to sen-
ate President Ran Coble.

The recommendations read

“In our proposal for a so-
cial system there are three
guiding principles:

“(1)- The most
concern is
adequate
everyone;

(2) An immediate change
in the social system is need-
ed

‘*(3) the specifics of the
change should be decided by
the students, faculty and ad-
ministration on campus with
the trustees in a yea-or-nay
saying capacity. The power
is’ theirs to approve or dis-
approve the. change, but
‘they should not dictate a
specific change.

“The student senate re-
commends a system of nine
eating clubs on a nonselec-
tive membership basis. Na-
tional fraternities which al-
low nonselective member-
ship should be allowed to
stay on campus.

‘With, three houses vacat-
ed, one of these houses
might be study-oriented, per-

important
to provide an
social life for

haps with seminar’ rooms
and faculty. offices.

‘Another house might be
used for snack bar or de-
licatessen. The third might
contain the pool tables, bil-
liard tables, and ping pong
tables from the Union, thus
providing a recreation house
with TV and card room and
also the opportunity to en-
large the book store.

“As far as the national
fraternities ‘off campus are
“concerned, rush would still
be regulated by the college.

“With regard to finances,
all members of student body
must pay a basic social fee
to support this new system
" whether they are members
of on-campus house or off-
campus matignal fraterniti-
es.

“Only those affillated with
the on-campus houses, how-
ever, would pay the housing
fee,

‘Boarding will be on an
‘individual vs. organization’
basis, that is, the individual
will decide with the organi-
zation as to what the
charges for that person's
board will be."’

“We also recommend the
