Davidson will officially inaugu-
rate Bobby Vagt as its 16th president
Friday.

Vagt is sincerely hopeful that stu-
dents will attend the cer-
emony and the luncheon af-
terwards. As one of only
sixteen days of its kind in
the history of Davidson’s
160 years, it is indeed spe-
cial.

The ceremony will be
conducted on the front of
campus where commence-
ment was held last May.
Afterwards, lunch will be
served in the area from Dana
to DCPC to Eu and Phi
Halls.

Eli’s of Charlotte will
cater boxed lunches to the
3,000 expected to attend.
There will be no standing
in long buffet lines.

On the eve of the inau-
guration, Vail Commons
will host a dinner for the
president, students, and
trustees.

Steak and vegetarian
dinners will be served on
the Commons Terrace from 5:15-7:30
p.m.

Students should check their post
office boxes for an invitation and meal
coupon.

In the event of rain, festivities will

disappointment to this point.

“T’ve probably had direct contact
with 40 or 50 faculty, but [haven't been
able to visit all of them,” he said.

“I’ve gotten out to see people who
work on this campus, but I haven’t done
a good enough job at that.

ration, which will open with an aca-
demic procession consisting of 70
present and former trustees, 80 del-
egates representing other colleges and
universities, over 125 faculty members,
and 50 student representatives from each

- class.

Several people will “bring greet-
ings” to the new president, including
former Chairman of the history depart-
ment and now president of Furman Uni-
versity Dr. David Shi.

The Davidson College mace, made
in 1988 by the late Jack
Ramseur ‘31, ‘will be pre-
sented for the first time as
a symbol of the office to
President Vagt, who will
deliver the only full-length
speech of the event.

Presiding over the
ceremony is W. Olin
Nisbet III ‘63, Chairman
of the Board of Trustees of
Davidson College.

At the conclusion
of the inauguration, the
Alma. Mater will be sung
and the Hattauer bells in
the steeple of DCPC will
ring an official welcome
our new president.

The Davidson Col-
lege Wind Ensemble and
“the Davidson College Con-
cert Choir will also per-
form.

“This has been an
amazing experience, pull-
ing this inauguration to-
gether in record time,” Inauguration
Coordinator Leland Park said.

“Working with the Davidson
family has made it fun and successful.
They have all wanted this to be a special
occasion,”

is a family get-together.’

“There is so much to do, that when

you try to meet the responsibilities of

the position as well as getting out to
develop relationships, you burn the
candle at both ends, and still don’t get it
all done.”

In preparing Thursday’s and
Friday’s festivities surrounding the In-
auguration, Vagt and the Inaugural
Committee tried to keep this idea of
community at the forefront of all plans.

“When asked how we wanted it
styled, rather than have all the pomp

and circumstance that some places do,
we decided we wanted to have short
ceremony, share a meal, involve stu-
dents as much as possible,” Vagt said.

“I think we need to keep empha-
sizing that this celebration, this cer-
emony, is really a celebration of tradi-
tion.

“The point is, this is a family get-
together.

“It’s nota celebration about Bobby
Vagt, it’s a celebration about Davidson
College.”

as part of the current Court system.

Barber cited three advantages of
bringing sororities to Davidson.

First, sororities offer excellent ca-
reer networking and post-graduate op-
portunities. Second, national sororities
will bring programs to campus on
women’s issues, alcohol abuse, and
academic skills. And third, sororities
would encourage inter-eating house
friendships and bridge the gap between
women on the Court and independent
women. _

But independent women Have, so
far, not expressed much interest in so-
rorities. Independents were left out of
the evaluation conducted last year, and
Barber acknowledged that there are no
independents serving on CEWOD.
“Participation of independent women
was sought, but there‘was little inter-
est,” he said.

Cost is’ another issue that has
sparked debate. CEWOD estimates
that joint membership in an eating house

and a sorority would be comparable to
membership in a fraternity. One-time
pledging and initiation fees amount to
approximately $200. National dues or
insurance fees are $50-$100 annually.
And typical eating house meal and so-
cial fees total $800.

The cost for membership in a fra-
ternity is about $1,100, equivalent to
what a first-year woman would be ex-
pected to pay for joint membership in
an eating house and a sorority.

Ideally, sororities would be float-
ing entities on campus, meeting like
other student organizations in the stu-
dent union. They would not have a
building on Patterson Court. But many
students are concerned that sororities
will gradually phase out women’s eat-
ing houses.

“Ultimately it is the President’s
decision,” Thornberry said. “But we
need to slow down and look at pros and
cons. As of now, CCRL is not prepared
to make a recommendation to President
Vagt.”
