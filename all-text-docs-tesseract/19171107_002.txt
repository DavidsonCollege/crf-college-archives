We know of no one of the official
college personnel who wanted to resign
because 2 Sophomore flag was floating at
half mast.

“It's nice to have money and the
things money will buy, but I find it far
more important to make sure I haven't
lost the things money can't buy.”—Ju-
lius Rosenwald.

Last weck we were incorrectly inform-
ed that the Freshman class did not buy
a Liberty Bond. We are glad to make
the correction and state that they have
hought one. Also, the - post-graduate
students purchased one. What a spirit!
Every class on the Hill aiding their gov-
ernment.

IN THE GLOAMING.

Realizing that there is a diversity of
tastes among the student body we have
added another feature this week which
we: hope will prove interesting. Some
students are interested largely in ath-
letics. Some are chiefly concerned with
the musical feature. Others have defi-
nite literary tastes.

This week goes back into the past and
brings to light some facts about college
journalism. This shows the point from
which THe DavinsoNian has evolved.
A comparative analysis is interesting to
those to whom this phase of activity ap-
peals.

Announcement is made in this num-
ber of Dr. Fulton’s new book, soon to
appear among the Fall publications. This
volume of Irvin Russell's poems has fea-
tures which have not appeared in other
editions of the work of the Mississippi
poct, This volume will be welcomed by
the student body and will be eagerly
read by those who have been introduced
to the charm of Nebuchadnezzar and
other poems by this master of the negro
dialect.

That Charlotte High is a plucky set.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, November 7, 1917

When are those uniforms coming?
Some have predicted that they would ar-
rive in time for a new Spring suit.

The New York ‘Times has an epitome
of the books relating to the war which
have been written since 1914, ‘The num-
ber totals 1,262—covering all phases.
‘The theme about which clings the great-
est number is “Germany.” Every maga
zine announces new books about the
struggle. What will the ultimate num-
ber he?

GRATITUDE TO ITALY.

Not only are we indebted to France
and Lafayette, but also we are indebted
to Italy. Now that she is being pushed
back by the Teutons, she is receiving
aid. She has never aided us in our
fights, it is true, but English literature
is indebted to no other nation as it is to
Italy.

Not only are we indebted for the clas-
sics which were engendered in Italy, but

‘lalso for the effect that the balm and

neace of the atmosphere which has so
influenced Byron, Shelley and others who
have gone there mad and found peace.
Many masterpieces have heen written by
almost formerly insane men who have
heen redeemed by the formative influence
of that country. May the diabolical
Teutons never ruin the literary shrines
and “grandeur that was Rome.”

COLLEGE HISTORIAN,

Nothing is the historian of the college
as is this publication. Then it is our
duty to record the change of customs
and idioms which come in and out from
time to time as well as to give the cur-
rent events.

One delightful custom which we ob-
cerve is the more intense seriousness.
Some students are taking six tickets
where only four or five are needed. This
has heen commented upon by Dr. Sen-
telle. who observed this tendency dur-
ing the matriculation of the students.

One thing which has delightfully
made its exit is the excessive use of
many slang terms. The term “bull,”
whith first meant a tendency exempli
fied by DeQuincey—rigamaroling; and
which later meant something akin to the
Elizabethan conceit — putting your
speech in a highly decorated vehicle—is
largely of the past. The term “horse”
which was once on the tip of every stu-
dent's tongue (its meaning we never
knew) is also going out. It is very sel-
dom heard. .

These items show that this year is be-
ing characterized by seriousness as has
never been ina long time. College men
are realizing that college is indeed an
efficiency training camp and that all are
D. C. Reserves.

Senior Speaking is an institution of
which the Seniors have had little practi-
cal experience. But they are seriously
facing the things now. The contact
comes the week-end following Thanks-
riving.

DR. DOBYNS
DOING HIS BIT

REV.

News comes that Dr. Dobyns, who
lives long in the memory of every Senior
and who has greatly endeared himself to
many of our alumni, has been chosen
from among three thousand ministers to
go to Camp Gordon, in Atlanta, where
he will have charge of the religious life
of the camp. Fifty thousand men will
give him a great deal to do.

Davidson's last four opponents in the
1917 season are as follows, and also here
is how they came out last week:

Auburn, 68; Florida, o.

COLLEGE JOURNALISM AT DAVIDSON IN EMBRYONIC FORM

Papers Antedating to 1884 and 1895 Bave Been
Reviewed and Give Mach Local Coloring of Past

Probably in the minds of most of us

there is an idea that THe Davipsonian
is the first attempt at college journalism
at Davidson. This is an error.

secing the light of this world.

The Library contains college maga-

zines going further back than the first

paper which is on record. The earliest

college paper which we have on record
is that of “The Davidson College En-
terprise,’” Volume I,
February, 1884.
plete file of this and there is one num-
ber only.

“The Davidson College Enterprise’
was edited by R. G. Sparrow. He lived
in Davidson, and before he entered col-
lege he edited this paper independently
and it had no connection whatever with
the student body as to its being repre-
sentative of it or being financially aided.
Mr. Sparrow is thought by some to have
one of the most brilliant minds of any
man who ever left Davidson. When
he entered college the publication of this
paper was suspended. It is said that he
would work geometric originals by the
scare at one time because they were in-
teresting. He translated Latin and
Greek almost as fluently as we read
Figlish.

This publication was a four-page,
four-column, twelve-inch sheet. It is
written in gond style. There are some
recipes (fillers) and there is wit and
humor to make it well balanced. It is
advertised as ‘fone of the cheapest week-
lies in the world’—being seventy-five
cents ner vear. The idea of his is a
necessity of tedav that “every gradunte
of Davidson College. should subscribe.”

Typical of his local column we re-
print:

A gentleman who lives just across
the river is happy over a recent ad-
dition to his family consisting of
three young persons.

The sunset Tuesday evening was
one of exceptional beauty, continu-
ing long after the sun had set.

As to the life of this paper we know
that it existed until February, 1884.
We can surmise that it was continued at
least thruout that vear if no longer.

TIMELY TOPICS.

‘The embryo of THe Davinsonian
came out June 7, 1895. This college
journal is entitled “Timely “Fopics.”
The Sophomore class of 1897 were the
editors, under the supervision of their
English professors—Dr. W. S. Currell.
now President of University of South
Carolina. We quote from the editorial
of the professor :

Every member of the Sophomore
class has an article in this paper.
and no member of any other class
has written for its columns. While
this mav not be the way to secure
an ideal paper, it is tht only way
by which the class can be fairly rep
resented. It is perhaps needless to
add that articles upon topics of the
day, selected with reference to the
tastes and special gifts of each mem-
her of the class, are likely to be bet-
ter conceived and better written
than stilted compositions “upon the
glory that was Greece and the gran-
deur that was Rome.”

As editors often get in trouble about
the product of their pen, we understand
that this paper was not immune. One
headline article is “Awful Collision.”
which is a graphic and vividly detailed
account of a wreck (probably

near Greensboro. In this fatality sev-

vividness and truthfulness to the real,
the company, we understand, threatened
to sue the writer of this article, ‘T'ran-

Hagan.

The articles appearing in this are
largely didactic, better suited for the
magazine. But it is the first attempt

posite authorship and being representa-

Observer Printing House, in Charlotte.

"l‘Timely Topics’ is modelled upon the

‘Charlotte Observer.’ If anything is
amiss in it, readers are requested to
blame the model.” In size it was about
the size of its recognized prototype, tho
having only six pages.

There is reflected thruout a great deal
of humor. There are lengthy discussions
of state and national affairs: “Fusion of
the Two Democratic Factions in South
Carolina,” and “The Outcome of the
Fusion in North Carolina.” There are
three poms in this paper.

It is a mirror of campus life of those
days. There is a column headed “Dav-
idson Doings,” in which a timely excerpt
appears:

Senior speaking was. held April

stage was well decorated, with the
class colors of 1895 and with ever-
greens (by the Freshman class) . .
The speaking was very good and
only one or two had to be prompt-
ed in their speeches. Messrs. Mar-
tin, Underwood and Wilson were
chosen as representatives to speak
at the Commencement.

Another items of interest is about a
nrember of our faculty:

The famous speaker [Dr.] A.
Currie, delivered an oration at the
Lyceum on Monday evening. At
one time both orator and audience
were entirely overcome with emo-
tion.

Another article reflecting the life and
spirit of the campus is a program of the
dramatization of the history of the edit-
ing class.
