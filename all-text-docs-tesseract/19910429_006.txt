Yet Another Article About Rape at Davidson

It seems these days that you
can’t sit down to dinner without
having to listen to someone com-
plaining about rape, acquaintance
rape, sexual assault, etc. So far,
however, coverage of the rape is-
sue has been very biased; the
Davidsonian has published only
ultra-liberal anti-rape articles. It’s
high time that the voice of reason
had a chance to be heard.

We have recently become aware
of the existence of the Rape Aware-
ness Committee, a self-styled group
of liberals that lectures eating clubs,
freshman halls, and fraternities on
the evils of rape at Davidson. This
group is promoting a dangerous
delusion - the delusion that rape is
somehow unnatural.

We believe that they are creating

an issue where no issue exists. Rape
is the norm in the animal world and
is considered to be a natural part of
the reproductive process, as any-
one who has witnessed the wild
vigor of animal copulation can
attest. Rape is also one of the old-
est known forms of man’s sexual
expression. It has existed since the
dawn of man and will probably be
with us until the end of civiliza-
tion. Furthermore, rape has only
comparatively recently acquired
“crime” status; until the 1980s, for
example, mandatory sex was con-
sidered a husband’s marital pre-
rogative, and in the majority of
states today, so-called “marital
rape” is legal and cannot be prose-
cuted. Finally, the fact that most
rapists go unreported and unprose-
cuted suggests that women who
are raped arc ambivalent about their
experience: is rape really acrimc?
Or have they brought it on them-
selves?

As Americans, we applaud our
liberal fellow-students’ willingness
to exercise their First Amendment

rights on this issue. However,
Davidson College is not doing

enough to financially and verbally
support those of us who feel other-
wise about this important topic.
The following proposals suggest
some ways in which Davidson Col-
lege can rethink its attitude and
offer institutional support to those
who see sexual assault differently.
1. The word “rape” carries ex-
cessively negative connotations.

vantage of reflecting the glorious,
civilization-founding role manda-
tory sex has played in founding
Western culture. What would we

2. Scientists have documented the
fact that women fantasize about
rape. Isn’tit time weclosed the gap
between fantasy and reality? Girls
will find that acknowledging their
deep-seated desire to be raped will
help them develop amore positive
attitude, which may lead to more

dates and marriage proposals. Stop
fighting it and start enjoying it,
girls!

3. It is not enough simply to
change our attitudes about sexual
violation; we must work to institu-
tionalize rape at Davidson. We
suggest adapting the traditions of
hunting (which offers a fine model
for regulating a revenue-generat-

ing blood sport) to ravishment:

a. Men should be
required to register their biological
weapon (according to calibre size)
with the Davidson police in order
to qualify fora yearly license (fee:
$10). Corresponding color-coded
registration stickers should be is-
sued, to be displayed in a promi-
nent place, and surrendered to the
campus. police in case of a rules
violation.

b. Official seasons
should be determined systemati-
cally by the breed of the quarry.
Fall, for example, should be open

raping season on brunettes andred-
heads; winter and early spring on
freshman girls, and late spring on
blondes. The latter girls (epito-
mized by the Sports Illustrated
swimsuit models) are the most
prized since they are the rarest at
Davidson, and therefore only men
of correspondingly great calibre-
size will be allowed to ravish dur-

c. Formalraping facilities should
beconstructed when necessary. As
most students know, Patterson
Court provides an ideal environ-
ment for ravishment, but it is high
time that the Board of Trustees
acknowledged the importance of
financing this tradition throughout
the campus. Outdoors, the exten-
sive wooded area behind the base-
ball field could be designated an
official ravishment preserve, as it
provides sufficient brush-cover or
“blinds” for ravishers to hide in as
they await their quarry. Or the Lake
Campus could be designated as a

quarry. Or the Lake Campus could
be designated as a raping preserve,
as it offers more space and natural
resources. Half the funds ear-
marked for erecting lights around
campus should be diverted for the
creation of darkened lurking-
places. Alternatively campus light-
ing plans should be cancelled and
the resultant savings allocated to
the construction of a grain alcohol
factory near Patterson Court.

d. Girls in|season
should report to the preserve or be
present on campus atall times, but
particularly from noon Friday until
noon Sunday. Rapists will be ex-
pected to observe a bag limit of
five girls per day, which should
suffice to protect the health of the
quarries (who will be defiled regu-
larly for four years) and to release
the uncontrollable hormonal ener-
gies with which Nature has gener-
ously endowed Davidson men.

Though we recognize the costs
of such an undertaking, we stand
convincéd that this farsighted pol-
icy would greatly improve. the
quality of student life at Davidson.
Abrasive feminist girls, who waste
valuable time and space with their
protests against the natural and
inevitable, would be too busy being
deflowered to write editorials for
primary function having been
usurped by Davidson girls, will
have more time to devote to what-
ever it is they study. More impor-
tant, in developing a positivé.atti-
tude towards ravishment, girls will
have gained back their freedom by
casting off their fearbeing “raped.”
Police escorts will be obsolete. And
Davidson men will no longer have
to expend herculean efforts to re-
channel their sexual dynamism. All
obstacles having been removed,
the sexes at Davidson will be free
to engage in meaningful relation-
ships.

Biology Professor Probes The Freshman Mind!

By Muck C. Raker

In what may develop into a
massive scientific and sociologi-
cal breakthrough, the Davidson
College biology department be-
lieves ithas isolated an actual neural
impulse from the cranial matter of
a living, freshman oganism. |

Neural impulses have long
been considered tricky entities. Are
only physical: interactions in-
volved? Or could there be some
spiritual side to the whole business
which science will never under-
stand? Disturbing questions such
as these left many of the greatest
scientific minds in history, includ-
ing Sir Isaac Newton and Oliver
Wendell Holmes,Jr., completely
befuddled.

The impulses of freshman
college students have proven espe-
cially problematic.
Spiritual? Worth the axonsthey’re
painted on? Only the brave have
entered into this delicate field of
study and most of them have gone
completely loopy. ;

Davidson biology professor
John Williamson, however (likely

Physical?

smarter, better, more organized and
larger than all who have gone be-
fore him), thinks he has data that
could change the way Man thinks
about Man,

Stated the Man for the
Davidsonian, “In a beaker, in my
office, hidden carefully where no
mortal would think to look, I pos-
sess aneural impulse, pale brown,
limpid and experiencing with-
drawal symptoms, from a fresh-
man student at Davidon College.

Wow!

Impressed, this reporter de-
cided to pursue the story in greater
depth.

Ten years ago, Williamson and
his biological colleagues realized
that more neural impulses likely
escape at Patterson Court than at
any other locale in Mecklenberg
county. This, they construed,
would be the best place to begin
the quest that could uplift the study
of Biology from glorified Sears
catalogue to actual science.

After nine years of develop-

“ment work to determine appropri-
ate costumes and strategy, the unit

felt ready to act.

Three weeks ago, unknown
the rest of the college community,
Williamson, clad in tie-dye shorts
and a shirt made out of cut up
Duckheads, led twelve cohorts to
the SAE house at approximately
four in the moring. In a comer,
half bobbing in a stagnant puddle
of Busch, there squirmed the
Motherload.

Acting fast, our hero whipped
out his special self-designed Im-
pulse Buster while twelve fawning
sycophants shielded him from the
tottering Hod who kindly requested
that if they had to shake-the-dew to
please use the side of the House.

Rushing back fora late nightat
the bio lab, the jubilant adventures
immediately commenced to poke,
plod, tiddle and scan until classes
began the next Monday.

Stated Williamson, “We feel
on the verge of something big. All
of us in the past have felt convul-
sions of riotous merriment when
we published ten pages of butt-
useless pap in some candy-ass
scholarly excuse for a Journal that,

according to the experts, someone
once flipped through before he
died.”

“Understandable,” I stated.

“Now we are on to something
big.”
Williamson also expressed his
glee at some of the potentially
practical consequences of this
study. :

“That little glob of thought
process just sits there and jiggles.
Inscientific terms, that’s ‘in-bulges
and out-bulges,’ and it has re-
sponded negatively to all our tests
for sentient activity.” -

“Sounds globular,” I offered.

“I feel confident the our pres-
ent experiments will reveal once
and forall how stupid students are,
especially freshman, and how smart
professors are, especially me.”

Paralyzed for a moment on
some sort of trance, Williamson
failed to notice the freshman pre-
med student who wandered into
his office behind. Looking for a
Place to stick his gum, the young
man shuffled over to a green file

_ cabinetand sereptitiously reached

for the vacant space on top. It
wasn’t vacant. A glass Peter Pan
Peanut Butter jar with the label
pealed off smashed to the floor
scattering stinky fluid and brown
gooy stuff all over the place.

“Dude!” confirmed the fresh-
man, “I didn’t know you dug elec-
tric jello!”

Williamson snapped outof his
reverie but too late. He lunged just
as the bare foot aspiring doctor
sucked down the last of the quiver-
ing mass,

Yeah, Yeah, we know... This
article really isn't much of
an opnions piece, but, it's
Sunday afternoon, and we
have to go to press, and I
have other crap to do, and
my feet hurt and I think I'm
getting hemmorhoids (or

_ however the hell you spell it)

so leave me alone and read
the damn thing again, and
laugh, ‘cause it's fanny!
