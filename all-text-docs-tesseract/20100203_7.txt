Compostable Cups: A
Saddening Tale of
Stolen Manhood

Patterson Court— All is not well
in the basement of Delta Kappa
Epsilon. The bartender weeps
openly into every beer he pours;
the brothers, arms around one an-
other, sip meekly at their Solos. A
faint chant of “bitch” echoes like
a dirge around the sullen room.
These boisterous, insensitive broth-
ers we came to know and love are
but shadows of their former selves.
The culprit?

The eco-cup is tearing a
sacred brotherhood apart

“It’s these damn eco-cups,” chap-
ter President S. Mydee managed to
tell me through his chokes and sobs.
“We in the Lambda chapter are
proud of our long tradition of either
ignoring or directly assaulting the
environment, but for this one we
can’t find someone to call a pussy
until he or she stops guilt-tripping
us.”

All facets of Kappa Ep life
have been influenced by the new,

“All facets of Kappa
Ep life have been
influenced by the new
‘hippie’ cups”
“hippie” cups. Beirut has ceased
because, as Mydee explained, “we
don’t want our balls in those;”
once-revered thrice-daily chuglines
have been discarded because “the
new cups don’t bend to the shapes
of our huge mouths.” Disputes
among brothers have also risen by
63% since the start of the semester,
relative sobriety revealing they
don’t actually like one another as
much as they thought they did.
When questioned about the
matter, the EAC had this to say:

The Kappa Eps were a mournful
sight last Friday night

Tringe Groep Uses
Acronyms in Attempt
at World Domination

New York, NY—In recent weeks
groups of angry protesters and dis-
gruntled members of the GLBTQ
community have been fighting just
about anyone in hopes to expand
their unchallenged stranglehold on
the concept of sexuality and, there-
fore, authority over more or less
every single member of the human
population. Their latest victories
have been additions to their snake-
like acronym, which is now grow-
ing daily: GLBTQABAFFPNGS5S0B
KLICPHP3%7S @8vB3t6H$GRE(
F)FOWP?QMJO.

“They snuck in an
‘A’ at the end, like no

one would notice...”

Advocates Monday snuck in an
“A” at the end, like no one would
notice. “A for Ally” rogue recruit-
ers innocently hang flyers, attend
massive assemblies and even smile
when you walk past them on the
street, all in a diabolical interna-
tional plot to transcend the lines of
sexual orientation and gender asso-
ciation as a means to better control
entire populations.

“You know, they kind of remind
me of the Yankees. With all these
recent acquisitions it seems as
though they’re just targeting every
free agent available. It’s really just
unfair to the smaller market organi-
zations that cannot afford to lure in
this kind of talent,” cried Michael
Jones shortly after he had been
bamboozled into becoming part of
the acronym.

The list currently reads Gay-
Lesbian-Bisexual-Transgender-
Questioning-Allies-Business
Associates-Facebook Fans-Parents-
Neighbors-Gays-50 Cent-Burger
King Employees-Lebron James-
Cute Puppies-Homeless-People
from Colorado and so on...

“Tell the Kappa Eps it’s our bad.
We originally made them for our-
selves so we could poop in them
and bury them behind the Eco
House to save toilet water. We’re
not sure whose bright idea it was
get fraternities involved.

“The boyz” refuse to go down
without a fight. “We’ve been
brainstorming and came up with
some very promising solutions.
We’re going back to the red and
blue guys, that’s for sure; and if
we have to keep buying the hippie
cups, if they’re so eco-friendly,
we can just melt them down and
feed them to pledges. Everybody
wins.”

Multiple Organizations Fail to
Heed Dean Shandley’s Warning

Davidson — Amidst a flurry of school-wide emails, Dean Shand-
ley, our Dean of Students, sent out what was supposed to be the
last of an inbox-filling breed. The email discussed the priveleges
Davidson grants us and how to respect them. However, many orga-
nizations have completely diregarded the Dean’s message. The Crier
continues to burden our Outlook Express© network by sending out a
nightly email telling us about random events that no one is even sure
occur. The Police Station (SOMETIMES IN ALL CAPS FOR EM-
PHASIS) tells us how to walk safely and even tries to start games
of musical parking spots in the Baker lot, forcing students to move
their vehicles. A recent study has shown that of the people on the
Ultimate Frisbee email list, only 5% are on the team. None of these
mass emails are sustainable nor are they what our college strives for.

Major Disappointment:
The Yowl’s Handy Guide

Major: Anthropology

Reasons people choose this
major: They want to know why
people behave like they do; It’s
sociology without the statistics;
Digging in the dirt reminds them of
happier days in the sandbox; Who
doesn’t love watching tribal life on
the Discovery Channel?

Where they study abroad: Pretty
much any place where humans
have wreaked havoc on their en-
vironment, particularly the senior
apartments. (Sorry, Antarctica).

Career options: Archaeologist;
Museum Curator; Forensic An-
thropologist; Journalist; Wearer of
monkey suits at children’s birthday
parties.

Why people avoid this major:
Creationism has a firm hold on
them, and an “America’s-the-best-
while-all-those-other-places-are-
messed up” ethnocentric approach
seems reasonable.

Description: Anthropology majors
are a rare breed of Homo sapiens
sapiens who constantly question
what it means to be human and
will yell at you for using words
like “primitive,” “ancestor wor-
ship,” and “normal.” Looking at
human biology, linguistics, and
culture from a holistic perspective,
they haughtily assume they can see
all sides of an issue. They love to
spend hours in front of the glass
cabinet of hominid skulls in the
basement of Chambers. Plus, they
generally get a kick out of the “It’s
so easy a caveman could do it”
commercials.
