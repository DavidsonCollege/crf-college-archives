Spring Services

Are Brought

To Close By John A. Redhead

Subject Of Final Sermon Of
Spring Services Is “Captured
By Christ”

Rev. John A, Redhead brought the
annual Spring Services to a close at 7
o'clock last Wednesday night, April 17,
when he spoke on “Captured By Christ.”

Light services in all were held by Mr.
Redhead, beginning with the church
service on Sunday, April 14, and lasting
through Wednesday, with a morning and
evening service each day.

Mr. Redhead's opening topic was “Life
in Four Dimensions.” The four dimen-
sions spoken of by the young preacher
were ideals, depth of conviction and feel-
ing, and height of aspirations. He com-
pared the life of Christ to these four
and stated that Jesus was perfect and
complete in these dimensions.

At the Y. M. C. A. vesper service his
talk was on “The Power of Sin.” Three
main points brought out about sin were
that our sins are greater than we are in
guilt and remorse, that our sins become
habitual, and that our sins not only affect
us but others.

“How to Make’ Religion Real’ was
a message of marvelous frankness and

usefulness delivered before the assem-
bled student body at chapel Monday
mornitig. The big question that “we

should ask ourselves when in doubt about
a thing being good or bad, ethical or
unethical, -was-*What would Christ do
in this circumstance?”

The main note struck in Mr. Red-
head’s talk Monday night was “How to
Make Religion Real.” The way pointed
out by God was: “The Word was made
flesh and dwelt among us.” To be right
in practice, it should conform to con-
fession,

At chapel Tuesday Mr. Redhead told
“llow to Be Good Without Trying.”
The example given here was the way
the man Paul stated it. “We are all
with unveiled face beholding as in a
mirror the image of Christ.” Tuesday
evening, “Making God Real” was the
formula by which one could be happy.
-Hestated_that we begin knowing God
as a formula of explanation, but that
it is up to one to know Him as a fact
of experience.

Wednesday morning Mr. Redhead
spoke upon “Playing the Game.” Rule
mist be adhered to, we need men that
will do this, and the men who do win
out in the end were emphasized by him.

Mr. Redhead, now a pastor of a Pres-
byterian Church in Tampa, F'la., gradu-
ated from Southwestern in 1926, He
received his B.D. and Th.M. degrees
from Union Theological Seminary in
Richmond. His record is outstanding
and today he is one of the most enticing
and interesting ministers in the South-
ern Presbyterian Church.

Dr. Lingle Speaks To
P. J. C. Student Body

Dr. Walter Lingle, president of the
college, went to Maxton, N. C., last Fri-
day, and was there through Sunday.
During these three days he spoke five
times before the student body .of the
Presbyterian Junior College, all of these
services centering around the thought of
the Easter season.

Friday morning Dr. Lingle spoke on
The Witnessing Church.” The theme
of this talk was the thought, “Ye should
be witnesses unto me.” Friday night
the talk was on “The Praying Church,”
and dealt with the importance of prayer
to the successful church,

Saturday morning Dr. Lingle spoke on
“Christ at the Door,” taking his inspira-
tion from the passage, “Behold, I stand
at the door and knock.” Later the same

day, at. the Junior College chapel hour,
he spoke on “Putting First Things
First.”

Sunday morning the topic was “Who
Was Jesus?” and Sunday evening the
last talk was made on the topic, “What
It Means to Believe in Jesus.”

The Rev. James Appleby; an alumnus
of Davidson College, is the pastor of
the church at Maxton; he was formerly
the secretary of the-Y. M. C. A. here.
Students will probably remember him as
guest preacher here in November.

Tonight Dr. Lingle will speak at a
dinner to be held at 6:30 at the Cham-
ber of Commerce in Charlotte. The
meeting will be made up of men and
women interested in a memorial to Alex-

Head Of Psychology Department
Addresses Alumni Group
In Gate City

Dr, Frazier Hood, head of the Psy-
chology Department of Davidson, made
an address to the alumni at their sup-
per meeting held at. the: King Cotton
Hotel, Greensboro, N. C., on April 15.
Dr. Hood's address
was “The Spirit of Davidson.” He as-
serted that the college does not accept
new ideas or new people without thor-
oughly trying and testing them. The
keynote was “The Spirit of Davidson
is the Spirit of Caution.” He also stated
that it was this thoroughness which often
enables its athletic teams to defeat the
teams of much larger institutions, and
he emphasized that students at Davidson
are not taught to win so much “As they
are taught to “play the game.” If* they
lose, all is not lost, the unconquerable
spirit still remains, he pointed out.

Dr. Hood jokingly explained that he
had quieted critics at who,
when he first came to Davidson 14 years
ago, had suspected him of being a Yan-
kee, a westerner, a “modernist,” and a
big bad “behaviorist,” by pointing out
that he was more of a North Carolinian
than they; since they had been accident-
ally born in the state, and he had come
to it of his own volition.

The subject of

Davidson,

He closed his
address with a plea for a well-equipped
psychology laboratory at the school.
