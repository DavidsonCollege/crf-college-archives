Baseball is a boring game. This is
what all of my non-baseball watching
friends perenially tell me. Towards the

ginning to believe them. Two weeks ago,
I wrote a column in which I whined about
the lack of excitement down the stretch,
and I said something like “Wake me
when the playoffs start.” I’m glad some-
one-did.

_ ing through ever since the Braves took a
nosedive in July are gone, and if they
' ever re-surface, I feel sure that I could
cure them by simply remembering this
week. Everything that the end of the reg-
ular season lacked — drama, tension,
and heroes, among other things — was
packed into two short series. In the space
of only thirteen games, the Mets, Astros,
Red Sox, and Angels elevated the game

World Series.

Game one.of the NL series set the
pace for the rest of the series when Mike
(Great) Scott stared down | Dwight

the strength of Glen Davis’ leadoff home-
run in the second. Scott was nothing short:

League’s best offensive ‘team look like
Little Leaguers en route to striking out
14. In game uae Bob Ojeda showed the

end of the 1986 regular season I was be- _

The baseball blahs that I had been liv-’

to a level not witnessed since the 1975:

Gooden and the ‘Astros and won 1-0on _

' of awesome as he made the National ©

Astros that he can pitch a a little too as he

‘scattered 10 hits on the way to a 5-1 vic-

tory.

In game three, things really started to
heat up. The Astros jumped out to a 4-0
lead and it looked like they were in con-

trol. Then something funny happened. ~

The Mets rallied to tie it at four and Hous-
ton got another run to push back ahead. It
stayed that way until the ninth when Len

Dykstra took Houston’s relief ace Dave -

Smith deep for a two run shot to put the
Mets ahead for the first time on the day
and win the game. “What a great finish,”
we all thought. Little did we all know that
it was only a warm-up for the heart-
wrenching events to come.

That same night in Anaheim, the
strange goings-on kept on going. After
three rather ordinary games that saw the
Angels take a 2-1 series lead, Boston and
California played a game that had all the
hallmarks of a classic. With Boston up 3-
0 and Roger Clemens on the mound it
seemed all -but over. But something
strange was obviously funny in the align-
ment of the stars that night, because the
Angels rallied for three and went on to
win in the 11th..

By now it was evident that this was no
ordinary week in baseball. Something
extraordinary was going on. The next
night confirmed this. This time it was

Boston’s turn. After David Mp eeioen ‘

helped a Bobby Grich vane over the
wall, the Angels opened a 5-2 lead and
were cruising towards the World Series.
Then it happened again. Don Baylor at

the plate. BOOM! 5-4 Angels. It still
looked bad. for Boston when Henderson ~

came to the plate with two ‘outs, one on
and the goat horns already beginning to
sprout from his head. With two strikes
the Angels were packing up the equip-
ment. Henderson’s two run shot got them
unpacking and put Boston up 6-5.

If you thought the game was over
then, you obyiously hadn’t been paying
attention. Rupert Jones barely beat a
throw to home in the bottom of the ninth
and we were back into never-never land.
Jim Rice stabbed a Gary Pettis drive that
seemed ticketed for the wall to keep Bos-
ton alive, and Henderson delivered again
in the 11th with a sacrifice fly that put the
Sox ahead for good, and effectively
broke the Angels’ back. The fact that

’ Boston won games six and seven easily

cannot change the fact that games four

_and five were two of the most exciting

ever played when it counts.

’ All of this time,
Leaguers must have been watching, be-
cause they came up with two games that
matched up heartbeat for heartbeat with
the Americans. Game five -was a pure
power pitching matchup. The best old
pitcher in the league saa the best

the National

_ Play-offs live up to expectations aise

_ young pitcher in the league. Gooden vs.

Ryan. Amazingly, it was everything it
was hyped to be, and maybe more. Ryan
K’ed twelve, allowing only two hits, one
of which was, unfortunately for Ryan, a
shot over the rightfield fence courtesy of
Darryl Strawberry. Gooden struggled
relative to Ryan but had it when he
needed it as he held them to one run for 10
full innings. Just as it seemed that no one
would ever score again, Gary Carter col-
lected his second hit of the series and won
it for the Mets.

How could they ever follow that up?

~All you had to do was watch. In game

seven the Astros scored three in the first
inning and held tight until the ninth. By
now you knew what Yogi was talking
about. Again the Mets rallied and’ the
game went into extra innings. In the 14th,

the Mets pushed ahead, but the Astros,

taking heart from Yogi’s presence on the
bench, got a massive shot from Billy
Hatcher (who?) to tie the score again. In
the 16th, the Mets got three more, but be-
fore you could relax, it was 7-6 and the
Astros had a runner at second base with’
two out. But there can be only so many
miracles, and it will be thie Mets and Sox
in the series.

If the World Series manages even

"half as many heart-stoppers as the League

Championships did, it will go down as
one of the best ever.

Field hockey team loses to Catawba, 3-0 |

By EDWIN PAGE

The Davidson women’s field
hockey team fell- to Catawba
Thursday by the score of 3-0 in
Davidson.“

The Cats came out looking
strong in the first half and man-
aged to hold the ball in their offen-
sive end for the first third of the
period. The Cats also managed to

get a few penalty corners during
the. stretch. They could not get
their timing to click, however,
and never succeeded in getting off
a good shot.

Later in the half Catawba
began to control the play, and the
Cats made only occasional forays
into their offensive zone. Catawba
took advantage of two corners to
forge a 2-0 lead. The first goal

came on a blast from the edge of
the circle and the second came
after another shot from the circle
hit the post. Catawba pounced on
the rebound and stuck it into the
net.

In the second half, Catawba
took the opening tap and raced
straight through the Davidson de-
fense. Only a fine save by senior
goalie Nana Lay prevented the

score. Davidson was never able to
manage a_ significant threat
throughout the rest of the game.

Late in the half a Davidsonde-
fensive breakdown resulted in a
one on one situation, and Lay was
beaten on a beautiful backhand for
the third tally. .

Coach Betsy Pryor said of the
game, “We came out very strong
and aggressive, but we were men-

tally tired. We didn’t play well to-
gether as a team.

“We were alittle too tight. We
have to relax a little morg and have
fun out there.” :

The loss drops the Cats to 1-9
on the season. Their next game is
tentatively scheduled for Tuesday
at Salem, and Thursday they re-
turn home with a4 p.m. game vs.
Wake Forest. -
