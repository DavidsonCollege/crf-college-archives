EDITORIAL.

TWENTY VERARS OF SENIOR SPEAKING.

Twenty vears ago, in L894. the first
Senior Speaking exercises were held at
Davidson. furior Speaking had existed
for some time before this. “The Senior
exercises then were held in’ April, and
the practice was continued until two
years ago, when they were moved — to
Thanksgiving, a decigled improvement,
which has doubled the gayety and pleas
ure of the eecasion.

Burt twenty years have not dimmed the
pleasure, nor lessened the Joys of this,
one of the three social events of the year.
Rather has cach year brought prettier
and fairer ladies from the Old North
State and her sisters to grace the festivi-
ties by their presence and laughter.

Mav this speaking be the crown of all,
and the timid, trembling Seniors who
“say their little pieces” find rich inspira
tion from the daughters of the Sunny
South who are our visitors this week.

DEPOT ETHICS.

The editor of the Alagazine came out
with a strona editorial last month on
Campus Ethics. He limited his field of

student hanor te the campus, however,

and failed to make clear what so many
failed to recognize, namely, that — the
same hiph gentlemanly standard ts ex-
pected of every Davidsen man, wherher
he be on the walks between the dormi-
tories, or out in the country; or in an-
other city.

Carelessness as to this fact has been
often noticed, but never called to the
attention of the whole student bedy, as
it was last week. when an article ap-
peared in a weekly paper read in Pres-
bvterian circles of che State, describing
the rewdy conduct of some Davidson
students at the train toward some ladies
in ane of the coaches, “Phis is no new
thine, but ir tack such a severe, yet
kindly-orded comment from one out-
side to bring it forcibly to attention.

The student body by a rising vote the
morning after the anpearance of — this
article, derided to place its heavy moral
stamn of disapproval upon what already
should come under student government.

Te is a thing eehich wonld never be
done at home or if the laly were on the
campus. Tet us hope for the honor of
Davidson, that it will never he noticed
again.

IMPORTANT NOTICE.

All persons havine bills against the
Athletic Association should see that they
get in to the treasurer immediately. as
final reports of the Fall business will be
made promptly following the Thanks-
giving game. Settlement of any invoices
after that time will probably be delayed

indefinitely.

The DAVIDSONIAN. November 25, 1914

URNER-KING.

The fallewing invitations have been
received by friends of Mr. Robert King
in this city:

Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Henry Urner
request the honor of your presence
at the marriage of their daughter

Ann
to
Mr. Robert King,
Wednesday evening,
November the twenty-fifth
at half after cight o'clock,
Centenary Methodist Church,
Richmond, Virgina.

The above is of especial interest to the
student body because of the fact that
Mr. King is a prominent alumnus of
Davidgon, being a member of the class
of ryu6. After graduating from Dav-
idson, with honors, he attended Union
Theological Seminary. Following — his
graduation from that institution he was
ippointed evangelist. in the Synod of
North Carolina.
until last year, when he was offered and
accepted the presidency of James Sprunt
institute, at Kenansville, N.C.

ALUMNI NO'VES.
The Junior class & Columbia ‘Theo

logical Seminary organized last “Tuesday,
electing Davidson men to fill every
office. ‘The officers were as follows: P.
W. DuBose (14), president; Neil Mc-
Innis (14), vice-president, and 5. B.
Hoyt ('13), secretary and treasurer.

In a letter from Chas. ivWontgomery,
Jr. (169), who is president of the Geor-
vin Alumni Association, he says: “The
Atlanta members of the Davidson Col-
lege Alumni Association of Georgia met
last Saturday at the Ansley Hotel. Mr.
I. Q. Pharr was present and presented
very ably the scope and aim of — the
Alumni Athletic Asociation, and secured
a number of subscriptions. “The Georgia
Alumni are anxious to see athletics at
Davidson go forward and will contrib-
ute their share teward the cause. “The
alumai hope that the managers for the
season of 1915 will arrange games with
teams in this section, some of them to be
plaved in Atlanta. We would like very
much to have a game with the Univer-
sity of Georgia here next year, and we
believe we could beat them easily. We
were all glad to hear of the good shaw-
ing made against Carolina. A number
of us had seen Carolina in action against
Georgia, and we were gratified with the
result of the game, in view of all the
circumstances.”

GAME IS: PLENTIFUL.

Many nimrods are out daily pursuing
the game that is new legal to kill, and
all report that game is very plentiful
this season. It would be well to note the
fact that the season is closed for quai
until the first of December, and there is
also a fine for hunting on posted land.
The game chat is now lawful to shoot
are rabbits, doves. and ducks, all — of
which have been found within a few
miles radius of the college.

ished and moved into its new hall, It
