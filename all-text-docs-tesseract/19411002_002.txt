One of the great mistakes of thought in the
student body is that every student is honor
hound to report-any-violation of the student
body constitution,
the laws.

This is not so written in
Violations should be reported to the
council so as to strengthen the code of laws
that Davidson men have chosen to enforce
for governing themselves, but there is no viola-
tion of the honor system when a student fails
to report a misdemeanor such as drinking.

ither the executive committee or the stu-
dent council is allowed to try cases which come
under the student body regulations, but in
cases of honor, the student council is always
the first to have the case. If a case in cheat-
ing occurs after examinations are near comple-
tion and there is no possibility of a student

council meeting, the case goes to the, executive
committee directly.

Cases of drinking off the campus have not
been handled by the student council in recent
years, unless the case occurs when a person is
officially representing the school—this offense
has some special ruling of the faculty.

Perhaps there are still some questions in
the minds of persons trying to understand the
system, and they should be answered early in
the year so that ignorance of the law will not
be offered as-an excuse of the person tried.

“Bumming Ettiquette”

Each year certain members of the new
classes take advantage of their newness in
being slow to catch on to the.rules of “bum-

PIPE. DREAMS:
Pursuant to dJast week’s “Ques-

tion of the Week” column, pray let
me add a few words to the prob-
lem of. what to do’ with the. old
library. First of all, let us admit
to the fact that Davidson College
needs a social center. All work and
no play makes Joe College as well
as Dan Draftee a,dull boy. Thus
the U. S.O. Thus the Social Cen-
ter. (I fear that the U. S. O. has
made more rapid progress in or-
ganizing and arranging for social
centers than we have, but look at
their resources). College students
who have nothing on the campus

ties. I'm not saying that a Social
Center at Davidson will have a
revolutionary effect on the Student
Body in that on Saturday nights
you would find ninety-five per cent
of the students in the Social Center
shooting pool, playing ping pong,
and generally lounging in semi-
sumptuous surroundings. Mistake
me not, for the process_of enticing
men to stay here on week-ends
would be a gradual process, Girls
would have to be provided for or-
ganized parties, and other -attrac-
tions, tod unmentionable to be num-
erous, would have to be introduced.
However, as I ‘see it, through my
special pair of rose-colored, optim-
istic lenses, the primary purpose of
social center would not be to
keep the students on the campus on
week-ends. The  primeiple reason
seems to me to be the providing of
a place where the students may
meet, play, relax, and take their
parents and friends. It is quite
obvious that we have no such place
now.

As to the specifications for such
a building, I shall list those which
seem most important to me:

naturally will tir to other tocali=y

(1) A large general lounge room
furnished’ appropriately with sofas
and comfortable chairs and ash
trays. (things uncommon here)
There should be a radio-phonograph
combination, newspapers and maga-
zines, and a piano.

(2) A recreation room containing
several pool and ping pong tables,
bridge tables, playing cards, check-
ers, etc,

(3) Offices of the Y.
DAVIDSONIAN,
pus publications.

(4) Meeting rooms for honorary
fraternities and other clubs.

(5) A ladies’ lounge and powder
room for the convenience of par-
ents and dates.

M5 G)7A;,
and other cam-

Of course these are merely the
most important items that should
be included in the facilities. Others
which have been suggested not only
by myself but by other students I
shall list briefly: (1) a large dormi-
tory room for men on visiting ath-
Ietic teams, (2) a nicely furnished
room to house the almost completely
disregarded Carnegie Record Set,
(3) a small “snack bar” equipped
to serve coffee and soft drinks, and
possibly sandwiches, and operated
by the Student Store, (4) an inter-
dormitory-inter-floor telephone..ex-
change, operated by N. Y. A. boys,
andcalculated to save freshmen a
four-flight leap to the telephone
booth and also to make the dormi-
tories more quiet by doing away
with the violent screams that
oftimes issue from the first to the
fourth floors.

Most of these items have prob-
ably already been discussed by the
Proper authorities and powers that
be, but I throw them out for what
they're worth, arid hereby look for-
ward to coming back to my class
reunion and sinking up tomy arm-
pits in the carpets in the general

lounge room of the Student Union.
