Welcome to the
Great Outdoors

By JoHN RoE
Staff Writer

Sometimes I just have to get away from it all, and in my case, this
usually involves a trip to the great outdoors. With. the increasing
amount of dammed and polluted rivers, and the disappearance of many
forest areas due to logging, it is getting hard to find a place to enjoy a
day on the water or in the field. There are still places where the stag’s
antlers grow thick with age, and the native trout seem to attack any old
fly with reckless abandon. This summer, I found that sometimes it takes
the extra effort to find such a place.

In July, I trekked to the Smoky Mountains with a backpack full of
three days gear and a flyrod, of course. My destination was unclear, but
I knew that there were two streaks of blue that met at the bottom of a
gorge on my map. I imagined the two creeks meeting to form a great
blue pool, deep and full of trout. There were no trails leading in, so I
followed a maze of game paths and creeks, tumbled through a tangle of
rhododendron and slid down a muddy bank into a small forest of
stinging nettle.

The journey down was difficult to say the least, but what awaited

at the bottom was well worth the hardship. For the next couple of days
I enjoyed fantastic fishing. Nearly every time my fly hit the water,
another eager brook trout exploded on the surface seemingly trying to
dismantle the combination of hackle, thread, and fur on the end of my
fly line. I caught brookies, rainbows, and browns, identified bear, deer,
and bobcat tracks, and even found time to explore other tributaries. The
best part of it all, however was that I had the whole place to myself. Not
many people were willing to put forth the extra effort to find this creek,
leaving me with the chance to enjoy fly-fishing in an unspoiled
wilderness setting.
There are many places similar to this one in the Smoky Mountains,
Wilson creek, and Linville Gorge areas and Stone Mountain State Park,
most of which I am still looking for. I will not tell you the name of the
creek I spoke of for reasons both you and I well know, but an
adventurous attitude and the right research can put you in a place where
the native brook trout still thrive, or where the buck dies of old age.
Sometimes a promising lead or hunch will lead to disappointment, but
when you find that magic, once in a lifetime place, it will be hard to
return to the crowded woods and waters that are easier to reach.

Men’s soccer routs Citadel,
splits two i in Las Vegas

After routing The Citadel on
Wednesday, the men’s soccer team
split games at the UNLV Coors
Light Classic in Las Vegas last
weekend.

The Wildcats proved to be too
much for The Citadel. Phil Julien’s
first goal, assisted by Robert Clarke
29:06 into the contest, ignited an
explosive Davidson offensive out-
put.

Julien followed with another

goal and assist, Robert Clarke.

added a goal, and sophomore
Carlos Bowen, who missed all of
last season with a knee injury,
notched his first collegiate points
with an impressive two-goal per-
formance.

“Our offense really gelled to-
day,” coach Charlie Slagle said.
“Tt was nice to rotate the guys and
see everyone perform.”

The Wildcats, riding a four-
game winning streak into the week-
end, were able to sustain the pace
Friday against St. Mary’s of Cali-
fornia.

After falling behind, 1-0,
Davidson quickly evened the game
at the half with a goal from senior
forward Bryce Jewett assisted by
Dennis Buck. After the teams
played a scoreless second frame,

the first overtime saw Robert
Clarke punch in a goal from 20
yards to give the Wildcats the 2-1
victory, their fifth in a row.

On Sunday, perhaps after a
late night at the casinos, Davidson
fell to the hometown Runnin’
Rebels. Vegas took advantage of
single half goals by Phil Detmer

and Michae
win.

The Wildcats, now 5-2, accel-
erate into the next portion of the
schedule.

Wins against App. St. and
VMI are key for Davidson to gain
confidence for their next big test
against UNC-Greensboro.

Last year’s stars test pro waters

Quinn Harwood, who aver-
aged 14 points per game last sea-
son and earned All-Conference
honors, was offered $165,000 to
play in Spain’s top professional
league.

But he was then invited to
play in the Chicago Bulls’ summer
league (8-10 games) in Salt Lake
City.

Men’s B-ball Notebook

’ Harwood’s agent advised him
to reject the original $165,000 and
try to up his European standing or
even get some NBA bites with a
good performance in Utah.

But according to coach Bob
McKillop, the versatile 6-9 post
player had a “so-so Chicago Bull
experience and as a result, passed
on the chance in Spain.”

Therefore, Harwood is in
limbo and has been working out on
campus with this year’s team, stay-
ing in shape until another opportu-
nity arises.

That copactinite will likely
come with today's CBA draft in
which he is expected to be chosen.

Brandon “Ozone” Williams
(18.2 ppg last year), who pulled in
All-Conference first team acco-
lades in his sophomore and senior

seasons, was flown to Greece last
month to negotiate a deal in the
neighborhood of $100,000 with an
Athens squad.

But Williams had an outstand-
ing Indiana Pacers summer camp
and Indiana coach Larry- Brews
took notice.

Brown told McKillop last
month that Ozone, -who played for-
ward at Davidson, has a future in
the NBA as a shooting guard, but
must first learn to play the position
at a high level in Europe.

Point guard Chris Alpert, the
school’s all-time assist king, has
seen interest from teams in En-
gland, Denmark, Finland, Sweden,
and the Czech Republic.

But earlier this year, the 5-11
court leader was cut by the Long
Island Surf of the U.S. Basketball
League.

“T’m still optimistic that he
will be playing pro basketball on
the European continent,” said
McKillop...

More on Minlend

When guard Ray Minlend did
not show up to classes, his transfer
to St. Francis (N.Y.) College was
made official.

According to head coach Bob
McKillop, the 6-3 Cameroonian
spent the first four or five weeks of
the spring period working out ex-
tremely hard, anticipating a promi-
nent scoring and leadership role
this season.

“But by mid-April his enthu-
siasm somewhat changed,” the
coach said. “He began investigat-
ing the thought of transferring at
the end of April.”

Minlend wanted to pursue a
more career-oriented education
than was offered here at Davidson
and apparently thought St. Francis
was the right place.

“I was shocked, very sur-
prised,” stated McKillop. “To this
day, I’m still puzzled. I think -
(Minlend’s decision) is a short-
term solution for a long-range is-
sue.

“St. Francis and Davidson are
in two different planets,” he con-
tinued, adding that both St. Francis’
academic and basketball opportu-
nities pale in comparison to
Davidson’s.

“He (Minlend) was very pro-

» ductive for us fortwo years, but the

team obviously will find somehow
to replace him,” said McKillop,
eager to look ahead. “Raymond is
replacable. Idon’t think the loss of
five seniors is.

“If we’re going to be in this
thing, we better be as united and
focused as possible.”

Especially considering this
year’s schedule, dotted with some

of the nation’s elite.

. The Wildcats face Tim
Duncan and Wake Forest in Win-
ston-Salem, Duke in Cameron In-
door Stadium, UMass over Christ-
mas Breakin Puerto Rico, and host
Ole Miss, Southern Methodist, and
UNC Charlotte.
