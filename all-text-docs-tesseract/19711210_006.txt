The Ravidannian

Local Players To Present ‘Superstar’

“Jesus Christ, Superstar” is
coming to Davidson.

Dr. Anthony Abbot, Professor
of English and temporary direc-
tor of the Davidson Community
Players, has announced that the
Players will perform the con-
troversial rock-opera for their
annual winter production.

The Community Players are
made up of those members of
the college community, such as
professors and their families,
who are not normally able to
participate in the dramatic pro-
ductions of the student body.
The community group augments
the three yearly productions of
the students with its own win-
ter and summer presentations.

Abbot said that the commu-
nity dramatists ‘‘should easily
respond to the mood and the
spirit of ‘Superstar.’ The David-
son community is overflowing
with latent musical and dram-
atic talent, a surprising wealth
of stage ability. This is a town
full of hams.”

The play itself demands such
talent, according to Abbot.
‘Superstar’ is a difficult play
to perform, for it involves in-
tricate technical, musical, and
dramatic work. It is, of course.

India Cancels
JYA Program

By DAVID HANIG
News Editor

The Jurior Year Abroad Pro-
gram at the University of Bar-
oda, India has been cancelled
by the Indian Government, ‘‘at
least for the academic year
1972-73," according to President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

In an airmail letter received
yesterday, Deputy Assistant
Minister for Educational Ex-
change S. N. Lohpia explained
“that relations between our two
countr.es do no: allow the in-
auguration at this time of the
exchange program between
Davidson College nad the Uni-
versity of Baroda.

‘‘We hope that conditions con-
ducive to the proposed ex-
change will be re-established in
time for the 1973-74 university
year,’ Lophia continued

Spencer expressed shock that
the Indian Government had de-
cided to cancel the program.
“T am amazed that the Indians
approved the program only a
few weeks ago and then de-
stroyed the work of both David-
son and Baroda personnel who
worked so hard to get the pro-
gram ready for next year.”

Assistant Professor Frederick
Gaige, director of the South
Asian Program, thought that
the cancellation was in retalia-
tion for the American Goyern-
ment’s freezing of uncommi:-
ted aid funds in the pipeline.
‘I think that it is quite obvious
that JYA in India is one of the
casualties of the Indo-Pakistani
War.”

Lohpia’s statement about the
relations between the U. S. and
the Indian governments seems
to refer to the air cut-off and
to statements by the State De-
partment critical of India’s
position. It’s a pity that they
chose exchange programs as a
means to retaliate, though.”
Gaige said.

one of the best pieces of drama
produced in this century, and
this is why we've chosen it for
our winter production.”

Cast in the lead role as
Christ is Dr. Earl MacCormac,
a member of Davidson’s phil-
osophy department and one of
the community’s foremost hand-
ball players.

‘“‘MacCormac is perfect for
the part of the Superstar,’ Ab-
bot commented. ‘“‘He already
has a feel for the role, a na-
tural portrayal of the Messiah,
and it appears that the role
was made for him and he for
the role.”

Judas, the antagonist in the

story, will be played by H. Ed-
munds White, Director of Ad-
missions. White, who played the
executioner in the stage pro-
duction of “A Tale of Two
Cities” and performed as Simon
Lagree in ‘‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin,”
is considered by Abbot as a
natural for the role of Jesus’
betrayer.

Sara Penland, a college secre
tary. has been chosen to play
the voluptuous Mary Magda-
lene. The role was given to
Mrs. Penland over the more
experienced Mary Earnhardt
“‘beause of the depth of feeling
and sensitivity Sara has dis
played in practices,’’ Abbot

said.

Pontius Pilate, the Roman
military governor, will be play-
ed by Dr. Sam Maloney, Pro-
fessor of Religion, while show-
man C. Shaw Smith, Director
of the College Union, will play
the mocking, prancing Herod,
the local king.

Caiphas, the Jewish high
priest who runs the country
from behind the scenes, will be
played by John M. Bevan, Vice-
president of Academic Affairs,
in his Davidson stage debut.
Dr. Charles Lloyd, Professor of
English, will play the disciple
Peter, while Drs. George Aber-
nathy, E. E. Brown, Lawrence

Kimbrough, Chalmers Davidson,
and James Reid will perform
as the rest of the disciples.

Ralph Quakenbusch will con-
duct the nine-piece orchestra
and the 79-member kazoo band,
while Dr. Ernie Patterson, Pro-
fessor of Economics, will be in
charge of costumes.

Because the play, by virtue
of its radical interpretation of
the life of a sacred religious
figure, will probably incite some
public protest, Abbot has ap-
pointed William Jackson of the
political science department
and Dr. Sandy McKelway, Pro-
fessor of Religion, to serve as
consultants for public relations.
