Davidson Instrumental Ensembles
blow through Southern stages

By JEFFREY CROMARTIE
Assistant Arts Editor

The Davidson Instrumental
Ensembles concluded their spring
tour with energy and style. The
group spent half of its spring break
performing in Rutherfordton, NC,
Hattiesburg, MS, and Mobile, AL,
before returning to Davidson, where
the group played last Thursday
night. 2

The ensemble opened with an
original composition by William
“Doc” Lawing entitled “Fanfare”
on All Hail, O Davidson which
presented Davidson’s highly en-
dowed brass section. ‘

The ensemble moved on to
skillfully perform works composed
by Armas Jarnefelt, Gustav Holst,

and Alfred Reed. The gifted musi-
cians delighted audiences through-
out the South with Holst’s Second
Suite in F Major, and Opus 28 B
(which has a great Green Sleeves
section). Although all the players
exhibited excellent skills, seniors
Mary Baxter on oboe and Jay
Hudson shined in several sections.

Following the Wind
Ensemble’s performance, the Jazz

‘Band took center stage, geared up,

and blew everybody away with quite
a few toe tappin’, get-down tunes.

The seasoned lungs of senior
Tom Vanderbloemen aided the
trumpets in taking the lead in sev-
eral tunes such as Brass Machine
by Mark Talor and a Mike Hammer
song.

And what woulda performance

be without a stunning solo by mas-
ter trombonist, senior Steve.
Duncan? Duncanis currently being
fought over by all the leading per-
forming arts grad schools. If you
have heard Steve play, you are miss-
ing out.

Derek Kverno also caught
everybody’s attention with a flow-
ing improv on his soprano sax.

Overall, the group was well
behaved on the road, so I couldn’t
dig up a lot of gossip. Although,
Lewis Hoffman did rather slyly
spike the punch at the Cromartie
homestead — heaven forbid!

All these folks invest a great
deal of time and effort into creating
music for everybody at Davidson to
enjoy, which is obvious from their
fine performance last Thursday.

Snap, Crackle, Pop!
U2’s new album makes fun new noise

By JAMES BERRY
Staff Writer

U2’s latest amalgomation, the
elusive Pop, isafarcry from Bono’s
early promise of a return to basic
rock. But no one knows what
these four are going to end up
with when they disappear into
the studio — least of all U2.

As a follow up to the
crowded sketchpad. that was
Zooropa, Pop has enough conti-
nuity to be dubbed a “musical
direction” and affirms that the
90s haven’t left the boys en-
tirely scattered. Like their first
forray into the realm of dance
grooves, this new record uses
technology almost to the point
of musical molestation. I re-
cently heard someone confess,
“T liked them when they played
guitars.” Surprise, they've been
playing guitars the whole time —
not that they’ ve been obvious about
it. Find comfort in the fact that Pop
takes one small step backwards.
While a lot of the sounds on the

album dodge identity like movie
stars ina mini-mall, the guitars have
returned. The second single, “‘Star-
ing at the Sun,” even puts an acous-
tic at the front of the mix. You can’t
ask for much more these days.

Give me a break). Some of the
images conjured by these two are
rather poignant. On “Gone,” Bono
laments “Goodbye / You can keep
this suit of lights / I’ll be up with the
sun,” presumably growing a little
weary of the rock persona he’s

Lyrically, Pop probably won’t
draw tears of reverence. But Bono
and the Edge (given joint credit)
still make more sense than most of
the alternateens currently clutter-
ing the radiowaves (i.e. Silverchair.
“Throw the sailors overboard”?

But Pop isn’t all disenchant-
ment. U2 survives on a healthy
dose of humor as well. On “The
Playboy Mansion,” the words
slide over an easy groove and
lightly funked guitar. “Ifbeauty
is truth / And surgery the foun-
‘tain of youth / What am I to do/
Have I got the gifts to get me
through / The gates of that man-
sion.” Bono’s still hung up on
the paradoxes inherent in every-
day existence (a style that first
appeared on Achtung Baby and
got so much worse by Zooropa),
and Pop doesn’t really ease up, but
the album has enough of a mix to
keep the resulting whole fresh.

The themes floating amidst the
album’ s processed waves, while not
overtly apparent on the first listen,
certainly converge on a few para-
mount ideas. Just about every song
has somerefernence to God or Jesus,
but don’t jump to any Joshua Tree
conclusions. On “Mofo,” the most
techno of the bunch, Bono grumbles
“Lookin’ for to fill that God-shaped
hole.” Maybe the most cynical of
the album’s collection is “Wake Up
Dead Man.” The title refers to the
2000-year-dead Jesus. An interest-
ing adendum to this doubting slant
is that Bono’s vocal delivery seems
to have lost some of its punch. It
lacks the earnestness that covered
the earlier recordings. It’s not bad,
just different, and makes one won-
der how connected Bono is to his
lyrics.

In terms of sound, Pop doesn’t
lend itself to simple definition. Most
production credit goes to Flood who
has gathered acclaim working on
earleir U2 albums and with groups
such as Nine Inch Nails and Smash-
ing Pumpkins. Most of the rhythms
are programmed or looped by Larry
Mullen giving an electronic
