OPINIONS

MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1993

Sunday night, the student body was
invited to sleep outside. The Inverse Com-
mittee, which is a division of Reach Out,
organized a campus-wide event focused on
raising the level of homelessness aware-
ness.

This sleep-out was a good thing. It was
not, thankfully, a representation of the cor-
ruption, hypocrisy, and stupidity in a great
deal of homelessness advocacy today.

_. One of the most infuriating aspects of
homelessness advocacy is the attempt to
make those who are well-off feel guilty.
Ethan McCutchen fell into this unfortunate
trap, inadvertently I’m sure, in his Letter to
the Editor in the September 27 issue of The
Davidsonian. *

Twice he states that the reason for the
condition of those in poverty is the condition
of those in affluence. “Ourascension tonew
paradigms leaves others with less than a pair
0’ dimes;” and again, “If every action hasan
equal and opposite reaction, then perhaps
we can consider that the same force which
has propelled us toward ease has knocked
these families and individuals gloomward.”

~ McCutchen fails to recognize the actual
action/reaction relationship here. It is hard

the homeless.

work, determination, and taking advantage
of opportunity [the action] which results in
success [the reaction]. The process is not
propelled by some ambiguous force.

McCutchen closes the letter with this
sentence: “If you are the slightest bit grate-
ful for your comfort, meet us by the steps of
Chambers.” This implies that those who
cannot or do not join the sleep-out are un-
grateful. This is not true. It is very possible
to recognize and assist in alleviating the
plight of the homeless without giving up the
comforts you or your parents have worked
for.

Another example of this attempt to in-
spire guilt appeared recently in The New
York Times. A religious homelessness ad-
vocacy group placed an ad that compared
not offering help to the homeless with deny-
ing Mary and Joseph a room at the inn.

This is not an accurate comparison at

all. Joseph was an employed carpenter,
whereas the homeless have no jobs. Mary
and Joseph were denied a room because
there were none left. Ifthe homeless were to
assimilate into society—acquire jobs and
living spaces—there would be plenty of
room for them. It is shocking that even
religious groups will go to such illogical
lengths to make people feel guilty.

There is a trait of mainstream
homelessness advocacy which is even more
maddening than the attempt to stimulate
feelings of guilt.

Itisillustrated by a gesture Jerry Brown,
a recent presidential candidate, made in or-
der to demonstrate his compassion for the
homeless.

Jerry Brown spent the night on a sewer
grate surrounded by homeless people. He
wanted to show the country that he cared so
that he might get elected. Yet this was done

under the ruse of homelessness advocacy!
There is no way that joining the home-
less for one night is going to solve any
problems. Surrounded by homeless people,
why would you want to become one? In-
stead of entering the ranks of the absolutely

" poor, Jerry Brown should have taught one of

them to read or helped one of them find a
job.
So many of the solutions that advocacy
groups come up with are not solutions at all.
Project Dignity is the worst of these groups.
The homeless people in Orange County,
California, were stealing shopping carts from
a nearby grocery store so that they would
have something to keepall their stuffin. The
grocery store finally had the police round up
all the stolen carts.

Project Dignity recognized this affront
to the rights of homeless people and took it
upon themselves to provide shopping carts
to all the homeless people who needed one.

How can this be justified as an answer
to homelessness? A homeless person who
knew that he was going to receive a free

increased awareness.

Sunday night, October 24,
there was an experience which took
place in front of Chambers on be-
half of the Inverse Committee. It
was nota night of drunkenness but
of necessary sobriety to raise
awareness for the homeless: no
sleeping bag, no electric devices,
no food, and no roof.

We’ve heard the comment that
direct action is needed, not simply
awareness,, True, direct action is
vital; the Inverse Committee has
already participated in soup kitch-
ens and is planning involvement
through several other means of
hands-on efforts. By expecting to
have sufficient action without in-
creasing awareness, though, we’d
be trying to compose a master-
piece with a pen lacking ink.

I recently heard a speech by
Juan Williams, who wrote a biog-
raphy of Thurgood Marshall en-
titled Eyes on the Prize. Williams
told a story of Marshall’s early
college days, in which he was not
only uninvolvedin the Civil Rights
movement, but was actually an
obstruction to the cause. During
college, however, he was more
aware of the problem and of its

roots, which was why Marshall

eventually became a true leader
for Civil Rights. What a shame it
would have been if Marshall were
allowed to complete college with-
out exposure to the heart of racist
problems of the time.

By taking you to the heart of
the problem of homelessness, the
Inverse Committee hopes to in-

spire actions as influential as those
of Thurgood Marshall. We main-
tain that we can’t possibly expose
the true feelings of homelessness
onthe “manicured” lawn ofacam-
pus where professors don’t even
have to monitor tests. We do wish
tomake youcontemplate the plight
of the impoverished, and thereby
to increase awareness of a world
that has been far more unfair to the
majority of the population of the
earth than it is to most of us,, We

hope October 24 was a night for
you to appreciate, not to feel guilty
for, what you already possess.

Most of us at Davidson have
at some time had the feeling of
being rewarded less than we felt
we deserved. How often do you
feel that hours of studying seem
unrewarding? Luckily for us, most
of our efforts throughout life have
been rewarded to some degree; we
have beds, we have friends, and we
have food. Still, having had feel-
ings of unsubstantial compensa-
tion, we should be able to recog-
nize the horror of those whose ef-
forts throughout life have gone vir-
tually unrewarded.

There simply is not always a
direct correlation between hard
work and success. Consider the
luxurious Biltmore Estate in
Asheville, North Carolina. George
Vanderbilt, who never worked a
day in his life, was able to con-
struct the mansion with the money
of Grandpa Cornelius Vanderbilt.
If itis possible for a person to beso
over-rewarded, then why can we
not conceive of hardworking
people being left out of the prizes
at the otherend? Don’t fall into the
habit of envisioning all homeless
people as lazy bums.

There are as many or more
types/of homeless persons as there
are of people in homes, so we can’t
suggest that all are healthy people

Okay, now that I have your
attention, and you are interested in
my opinions articles, I can write
what I really think about things. I
would like to start off by address-
ing Bobby Ramsay’s article con-
cerning homosexuals which ap-
peared in The Davidsonian on
October 11. ea)!

First of all, I agree whole-
heartedly with every point that he
makes, but I just wonder why he
hasn’t gone further. Bobby should
have also mentioned that all ho-
mosexuals

seconds closer to your eventual
death.

Gee, Rob, that’s really uplift-
ing.

As we all move rapidly and
uncontrollably towards the end of
out finite lives, I would like to
propose a different, more positive
view of time.

In the story of “The Three
Friends” by the ancient Chinese
philosopher Chuang Tzu, one of
the three close friends dies. Rather
than demonstrating sorrow or re-
morse, the two liv-

should and will

ing friends begin

pits of hell (just relived, and the future is and playing a lute,

for a second!),

with a transitory point
called 'the present.'"

met with disap-
proval by a wise
man of society.

AllIwillsay
about Bobby’sarticle is thank God
similar arguments were overcome
during the Civil Rights movement,
so that people cannot legally lose
their jobs because of their skin
color. Don’t worry, this article
will not be about homosexuality.
I’m sure there will be enough let-
ters to the editor concerning that
subject. What I want to talk about
is something much more trivial,
yet it conditions every aspect of
our lives. What I would like to
reflect on is the nature of “time.”

Okay, I just lost half my read-
ersto Chris Frampton’sarticle, but
for the few who remain, I hope this
will be your “Deep Thought” for
the day.

Before I came to Davidson I
used to view time as a straight line
in which the whole universe pro-
gressed from one point to another.
The past cannot be relived, and the
future is unknown, which leaves
us with a transitory point called
“the present.”

The time it has taken you to
read this sentence cannot be re-
trieved, and ‘you ‘are just'a few

Although Chuang
does not explicitly say so, I feel
that implicit to this story is a view
of time in which all moments, past
and future, are contained in this
present moment. The mere
memory of the departed friend is
as real to the two living friends as
his or her actual human body.

Celebrating your friend’s
death. Wow, what a concept, al-
though I do not suggest you do this
at your grandmother’s funeral.

For me, the implications of
such a view of time are fantastic.
We no longer have to worry so
much about the end result. The
end result is the journey itself. I
should study, not to get a “grade,”
but because learning itself is im-
portant.

I should play football, not for
the glory (which offensive line-
men don’t get anyway), but be-
cause I enjoy playing the sport.

Lastly, Ishould love my neigh-
bor and serve God and others, not
because I want to “get into heaven,”
but because my actions in the
present moment are of ultimate
importance in.themselves,.""— <>. .
