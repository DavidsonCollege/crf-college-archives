Week in review: Men’s tennis team
shines in league tourney tune-ups

The men’s tennis team wrapped
up the regular season Southern Con-
ference crown with a 7-0 shutout
over VMI Saturday in Lexington,
Va., and a 6-1 win against Appala-
chian St. Sunday in Boone.

Davidson will enter this
weekend’s league tournament here
at Covington Courts as the favorite

along with second-seeded Furman.

Men’s Track

The Wildcat runners did not
score a point at this. weekend’s star-
studded Duke Invitational, but coach
Gary Andrew hopes the fierce level
of competition in Durham will lead
to solid results at the upcoming
Southern Conference Champion-
ships Friday and Saturday in Boone.

“Based on the way this meet
went, they seem to be ready to go
and do. well,” he said yesterday,
citing a slew of seasonal and person
bests.

Stan Baker (60.5) ran a per-
sonal best in the 400-meter hurdles,
Addam Marcotte (53.76) in the 400,
and Jonathan Fly (4:25.5) and Steve

Johnston (4:29.3) in the 1500.

Freshmen William Isenhour
(15:44), Thomas McElveen (15:55),
and Brent Ferrell (15:55.6) all posted
personal bests in the 5000, while
Dave Foss recorded a seasonal best.

Karim Lawrence registered his
fastest time of the spring in the 400,
Ken Howard in the 800, and Keith
Gordon in the 1500.

“Overall, it was a really good
meet,” Andrew added. “The guys
are really upbeat and feeling pretty
confident going into the conference
meet.”

Women’s Tennis

Preparing for the Southern

Conference Championships this

weekend in Greenville, S.C.,
Davidson hit the road for three
straight matches, losing to Marshall
Tuesday in Huntington, W.Va., and
Georgia Tech Friday in Atlanta,
before topping rival East Tenn. St.
Saturday in Johnson City.

The defeat at Marshall, a 4-3
heartbreaker, left the Thundering
Herd as the only remaining unbeaten

team in the league.

Only Lynne Shore, playing at
No. 6 singles, won versus the 48th-
ranked Yellow Jackets, as the Wild-
cats fell 6-1.

Dana Casner, Ashley Maner,
Clara Marks, Claire Cheatwood, and
Lynne Shore all chalked up singles
victories in Davidson’s 5-2 win over
the Bucs in the Mini-dome.

Coach Caroline Price believes
five teams - Marshall, Furman,
Georgia Southern, Tennessee-Chat-
tanooga, and Davidson - have a
legitimate shot of winning the con-
ference tournament championship
this weekend in Greenville, S.C.

“T feel like we’ll take care of
business against Western (today),”
the veteran coach said yesterday.
“It’s now a second season for us.
We want to put three days back-to-
back-to-back at the championships.
It’s going to be all about who does
it for three straight days.”

The Wildcats wrap up the regu-
lar season with matches against
Western Carolina and North Caro-
lina - ranked 32nd in the nation -
today and tomorrow.

The women’s basketball
coaching staff, which has secured
nationally recognized recruiting
classes the last two years, is at it
again.

The Wildcats will welcome

Women’s Basketball

Notebook

two high-profile post players next
season, Jessica Heath and Kim
Taylor, both of whom committed
to Davidson during the early sign-
ing period this winter.

“They can both play the four
(power forward) and the five (cen-
ter) and are both relatively mo-
bile,” coach John Filar said Thurs-
day.

“They are great young ladies
and very, very talented. They
should be great assets to the team
and give us so much more depth
inside.”

Heath, from Monument,
Colo., and Taylor, from Ports-
mouth, R.I., are 6-foot-2 and 6-3,
respectively.

Filar has also received verbal
commitments from two more re-
cruits who will likely be non-schol-
arship players, but still have an
automatic spot on the roster.

In addition, a potential trans-
fer will be making a campus visit
this week.

Filar could not disclose any

Women’s hoops woos more talent

~ dedication on their (the players’)

further details.
Learning from the past

Davidson’s Southern Confer-
ence quarterfinal loss to Georgia
Southern Feb. 26 in Statesboro
was a harsh way to end a disap-
pointing season of near misses and
below-expectation results.

But Filar believes this will
only make his squad stronger in
the long run.

“There has been a renewed

part as to what happened this past
season,” he explained.

“Tt hurt really bad, and be-
cause of that, I think we’ ll be bet-
ter, more determined, and more
committed. They’ll come back
with one goal: to get to the
NCAAs.”

Demanding docket

After getting off to a fast start
early last season, the Wildcats
struggled throughout league play.

Filar points to arelatively easy
pre-conference schedule as one of
the reasons for the drop-off.

The solution?

Davidson will play UNC
Charlotte at Halton Arena and
Georgia Tech in Atlanta next sea-
son, and travel to a tournament in
Michigan.

Ga. Tech, UNCC, and
Clemson are all scheduled for vis-
its to Belk Arena in 1998-99, and
Wake Forestis ona list of possible
Davidson tournament participants.

Homer
from page 14
Ken Griffey Jr., who had six hom-
ers in nine games going into Saturday’s
action, and fellow Mariner Jay Buhner
(44 round trippers in ‘96) aren’t half-
bad either.
Andres Galarraga, Ellis Burks, and
Vinny Castilla hit 47, 40, and 40 hom-

ers, respectively, last season for the
Colorado Rockies. And Larry Walker,
another Rockie benefiting from the no-
toriously thin, mile-high air at Coors
Field in Denver, had six in the first eight
games this year.

It will be done. If not this year,
then the next year. If not the next year,
then the year after that.

The only question is who.
