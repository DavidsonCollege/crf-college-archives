Big Days In

_ THE DAVIDSONIAN

ife Of Davidson

ONLY A CINDERED SHELL remained of the once proud Chambers Building after that tragic
day in 1921. The destructive blaze was the biggest news story of the 20's.

A BIG DAY FOR AN OLD EDITOR, who made good and
moved up to the president’s chair. In April, 1958, D. Grier Martin,
“Our Man,” proudly took the presidential oath from Dr. J. Mc-
Dowell Richards, another old DAVIDSONIAN editor who made

aeee.

Long Debate Leaves
Race Issue Hanging

The decision of the Supreme
Court in 1954 and the endorse-
ment of it soon after by the
General Assembly of the South-
ern Presbyterian church pre-
cipited a discussion of the in-
tegration of Davidson which
has continued in THE DAVID.
SONIAN to the present.

A student poll in 1954 reveal-
ed that the student body (with
52 per cent expressing an opin-
ion) was evenly divided on the
‘integration issue.

THE DAVIDSONIAN sponsor-
ed a symposium on the integra-
tion of Davidson and, in the
same issue, favored compliance
with the policy of the General
Assembly in an editorial: “The
end of segregation is imminent,
what can we do to facilitate ad-
justment?”

NATIONAL SCENE

Later editions of THE DAV-
IMSONIAN remained silent on
the integration problem at Dav-
idson, preferring to speak to the
national scene: “It may require
years for the South to accept
the Court's ruling, but such ac-
ceptance will come.”

The “Trustee Special” of THE
DAVIDSONIAN in February of
1960 put the integration prob-
lem forthrightly in the laps of
the trustees.

Results were presented of a
highly questionable student poll
which revealed 297 absolutely
against integration and 121 for
integration at the earliest pos-
sible time. All told, 303 stud-
ents thought that the way
should be made clear for inte
gration now or in the future.

PALL OF SILENCE

An. editorial on integration
criticized the lack of any at-
tempt to justify the trustees’
statement that “it is not in the
best interests of Davidson Col-
lege to admit Negroes at this

time.”
The editor maintained that

in the U. S. He hit the “pall of
silence” that hung over both fac-
ulty and trustees.
SICKNESS

The next week, as one stud-
ent decried the use of the paper
for pure propoganda purposes,
J. McDowell Richards chairman
of the trustees commented on

the Board’s complete lack of
action. “This is not a. sign of
health, but of sickness.”

In February 1961 the issue
was reopened as the trustees’
meeting approached. “Student
Body President Henry Shue pe-
titioned the board to let him
present a statement asking them
to remove the discriminatory as-
pect of the admissions policy.
Shue called for. Davidson to take
the lead in the South as a Chris-
tian institution.

CONGOLESE

Later that month the trustees
voted to accept three Congolese
students in deference to an in-
quiry by the Board of World
Missions. No new action was
taken at that time on the inte-
gration question. A committee,
that is still in existence, was

formed by President Martin to}

deal with the problems _ that
would be involved.

That May it was announced
that Davidson would not be sent
any African students after all.
The Board of World Missions
felt that the language difficul.
ties would be too much for the
earmarked three and so sent
them to Switzerland to study.
The board stated that it still
planned to send us one if one
was found they considered qua-
lified.

This year, after considering
the positive polled opinions of
the faculty and the students, the
trustees set up a committee to
study the "best interests" in-
volved in integrating Davidson.
The decision of Agnes Scott to
end racial barriers has been
considered by many as a major
breakthrough in the realm of
private schools in the South.

EARLY ROOTS

Today's knotty issue of inte-
gration at Davidson began as a
vague feeling that perhaps there
was a Negro problem in the
South.

The Reverend J. Little, as
part of a Southeastern speaking
tour, was heard in 1918 urging
the students to set up a study
group. After he left 70 new ap-
plications were made to an exist-
ing study program on campus
swelling the number of sociolo-
gical researcher workers to 95.

Little was heard from this
group. For 20 years no signifi-
cant news on the problem ap-

SNAPPING BACK SPIRITEDLY with a “Million Dollar Cam-
paign,” the college went to work to rebuild an even finer Cham-
bers. It was a proud day in 1928 when the new cornerstone was

set in place.

Martin For President-
Did Davidsonian Help?

BY LAURENS WALKER
Editor 1958-59

Jim Batten, a tall, lanky
boy from the peanut fields
of southeastern Virginia
stepped out of the door-way
of Duke dormitory.

“Where you going?” Jim call-
ed.

“To PT,” I said.

“Better cut. Slick John’s
just resigned. We're going to
do an extra.”

Thus my Davidson generation,
THE DAVIDSONIAN, and the
college entered a period of
change and transition that just
now seems to be ending.

The resignation of President
John Rood Cunningham surpris-
ed almost everyone—even THE
DAVIDSONIAN. There was no
better explanation than the ob-
vious.

Dr. Cunningham, referred
to, though respectfully, by

students as either “Slick
John” or “St. John the Di-
vine,” had simply decided he
had accomplished what he set
out to do at Davidson. He was
ready to move on.

T he. extra was produced under
thedle adership of editor Batten
thouxylf\as I remember, almost
every One on campus knew about
the resignation before we-gauld

the late Mr. F

Our printer
Broyles, used the large type
kept for grocery ads to forn
|the banner head, “CUNNIN
HAM. RESIGNS.”

As I look back now—just five
years jater—the resignation of
Dr. Cunningham seems even

more of a turning point than it
did at the time

He had laid a foundation.
He had either built or plan-
ned enough physical plant to
take care of Davidson's needs
for many years. He had more
than doubled the college’s en-
dowment.

But the step toward what was
|} then ealled “Southern predomin
wnee and national eminence in
the fiel’ of liberal arts educa

FOUR LIVING. DAVIDSON PRESIDENTS GATHERED on an historic day in 1941 for the
inauguration of Dr. John R. Cunningham. Posing with him on this rare occasion were Walter L.
Lingle (1929-41), W. J. Martin (1912.29), .and Henry Louis Smith (1901-12).

peared in 1HF DAVIDSONIAN.

In 1938 an editorial asked the
footba!l band to be more dis-
creet in vaulting the musical
barrier between the races. The
position of a Negro in the band
was not contested as long as
he wore his “own ragged cloth-
ing,’ but when he appeared at
a game wearing part of the col-
lege uniform several students
complained.

GIFT FUND

In deference to the conserva-
tive majority the band was ask-
ed to remedy this situation. A
letter to the editor the next
week suggested a substitution,
of the words “narrow minded” |
for “conservative.”

The students and the YMCA
took action to better the com-
munity situation in 1939 when
the Gift Fund was earmarked
for the building of a colored
community center. The “Y" set

up a Department of Colored
Work which was active in di-
recting and improving this cen-
ter.

In 1948, terming the previous
nine years of work a “major
success,’ the center was turned
over to a Negro Board of Con-
trol.

Late in 1951 a student defend-
ing an O.D.K. program mention-
ed that a Negro. probably
wouldn't be a happy person
here since he would have little
or no social life. He said that
the Negro would come here be-
cause he believed in a cause
greater than himself. The real
question posed was whether we

For a while there was a ques
tion whether such a step would
; ever be taken
Basically, it was the decid.
ing of this question that THE
DAVIDSONIAN of my era at-
tempted to report and inter-
pret.

Government at Davidson after |
the Cunningham resignation was '

mostly by committee. Dr. C. J
Pietenpol, acting president, very
reasonably avoided making any
basic decision. But THE DAV-

several times if anyone was
making any decisions at all
Perhaps such comment was not
wise. It was a frustrating time
| for everyone who wanted to
“get moving again.”

Meanwhile the trustees’
president—hunting committee
looked and looked. DAVID-

SONIAN reporters asked: and
asked. There were no answers.
No new president was’ found
as the months passed.

The question we were report-
ing, however, involved much
more than just the new presi-
dent. Any real step toward
greatness had to begin with
curriculum, faculty, salaries, li

| ternity policy.
| We wrote about these things

had the right to exclude another | Sometimes we were right, some-

human being from our educa-
tional process.

MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES | as we could to those who could | ened out the mess that had been | —

A reply said that we should
drop this matter and discuss
more important issues since it
was “repugnant to the common
tenet.” The writer further rea-
soned that the exclusion idea
was ridiculous since a private
institution by its very nature
excludes.

The editorial flavor shifted a
little in November of 1953 when
a columnist maintained that the
South could solve its own seg-
regation problem if given a
chance by the Supreme Court.

It would be misleading, how-

ever, to paint a picture of a
deadly serious group producing
a deadly serious paper each
week.

There was a lot of fun in-
volved. Let it never be said
that Hattie didn’t do a good
business on Wednesday nights
after the paper was wrapped
up.

I think some mention is fit-
in understanding THE

intelligent, and remarkably

dedicated group.

There are too many to include

all, but the names of Bill Patton,
Charles Chastain, John Trask,

Ed Armfield, Dick Smith, Frog
Cole, Addison Bross, George
Ramsey, Lloyd Chapin, Frank
Bloodworth, and Dave Jordan
deserve noting.

But the story goes on. Late
in 1957, in typical fashion,
THE DAVIDSONIAN decided
if the trustees could not find
a president for the college, ‘it
could.

So we took a stand. No names
were used, but by careful fact

choosing we made it clear who

the “four leaf clover” was we

felt the trustees could find “in
,. the campus grass.”

Typically, he was one of our
kind—an ex-editor of THE
DAVIDSONIAN

He had always been a friend
of the paper and a..most co-
operative news source—as well

as a man of recognized compe-
tence and ability. All acknow-
ledged we had picked something
of a dark horse

The trustees’ Cadillacs pull-
ed onto the campus in May
of 1958, and with them came
word that a choice would be
made.

We got set for an extra
warning Mr. Broyles to have the
grocery. type ready again

On the day of the meeting

there was still doubt. We wrote
stories about Our Man and wor-
ried that we might lose the gam,
ble in the last hour.

Then came the break. Bill
Patton, whose hearing ability
was always a great asset to the
paper, happened to enter a door
in Chambers building just a
step behind Our Man end a pros-
perous looking trustee.

Said Our Man: “‘We'll need
twenty million.”

Said the trustee: “That's a
hell ‘uva lot of money.”

We knew we were in.

That afternoon the an-
nouncement was officially
made. D. Grier Martin was to
be the next president of Dav-
idson College. In his first in-
terview with THE DAVID.
SONIAN—given about a min-
ute after the announcement,
he said, “| didn’t believe them
when they told me.”

We managed to get two pages
of copy out of that statement
and by nightfall a special issue
of THE DAVIDSONIAN was in
the dorms, Mr, Broyles was re-
pairing his press, and the staff

exhausted—was at Hattie’s.

The decision for greatness—
though not immediately appar-
ent I believe, made that
day

was,

All was, of course, not en-
tirely sweetness and light.
THE DAVIDSONIAN squawk-
ed, kicked; prodded, and com-
plained. And Our Man had
several serious talks there-
after with His Boys. on the
subject of a responsible col-
lege press.

The turn was made, though.
The recent reforms in curricu-
lum, faculty improvements, ad-
mission standards, and the
spectacle of a Secretary of State
shooting basketball in the gym
attest, in part, to the fact that
the necessary decision has been
made

Elections Machinery
Grows From Frauds

The election of a DAVIDSONIAN editor in 1939

of the still-controversial,

When rumors of a cumbine
began to sweep the campus, the
Student Council held two trials
One was secret, and the results
were not divulged. But the re-
sults of the second trial were
enough to shake many stud-
ents’ faith in the council. Even
though opinion was divided in
the council, three fraternities
were convicted, yet not punish-
ed in any way.

TRIES SWITCH

The council tried to pull a
switch in election procedure
and throw the election to the
editorial staff of the paper. But
the student body refused to
vote for the switch, and many
expressed disgust that the coun-
cil would try to change the vot-
ing procedure during an elec-
tion. Many students were angry
that people were hurt by trials

| that in the end did not amount

to anything.
The next year (1940) the
Student Council finally straight-

precipitated the controversy which led to the formation
still-nebulous Elections Board.

It set up, after an amendment
was adopted to the Student
Body Constitution to allow it to
do so, the Elections Board that
we have today. It was the duty
of the board to set up election
rules, define terms used in them
so that everyone would know,
for instance, what a combine
was and to run the elections.

STEAL BALLOTS

The same year the Elections
Board was created, another
amendment concerning elections
was added to the constitution.
Up until that year, students
voted in chapel and then passed
their votes down the aisle. It is
a reported fact that some men
would actually put ballots in
their pockets and walk off with
them if they did not happen to
like the name on the ballot.

Thus “stealing” of baljots was
eliminated that year, as well as
the absentee voting in which a
friend would vote for another
if he cut chapel.
