Lack of interest hinders Miscellan y

By BETH LAWING
Staff Writer

It is a thankless job—lots of work,
little glamour.

But for new Miscellany editors Gary
Hart and Patsy Daniels, the task is but
an interesting challenge. These literary
enthusiasts are responsible for the
selection and organization of original
works published in Davidson’s literary
review.

The Miscellany, although dedicated
to publishing only quality material, ‘‘is
not a very good publication.’’ This
admission comes from Bill Barnes,
graduation senior and past Miscellany
editor. He believes “‘if there were better
support from the English department,
if there were more emphasis and
encouragement of creative writing,
perhaps it would improve.’’

Student involvement left without
such encouragement, ‘‘is rather low,”’
says Daniels. And Hart comments,
“The interest isn’t there...it fluctu-
ates.”’

The review survives in the midst of
the apathy through its position as a
national publication. According to
Daniels, ‘‘most of the contributors are
not from the school...We generally
get only three short stories and ten
poems from the kids (here).”’

The contributing authors are from
around the country, often college
professors and students interested in
general exposure, sometimes semi-
professionals.

The size and content of the magazine
is primarily determined by the number
of quality materials received from these

authors. According to Barnes, his last
issue, due out soon, will be comprised
entirely of poetry. ‘‘The fiction we
received was so bad,” he says he felt ~

they had no other choice. The Spring
1978 issue, Hart and Daniels’ first,
will hopefully be able to provide a
greater variety.

Hart and Daniels also have ideas for

improving the quality of the Miscel-
lany. Besides changing the cover, they
plan to alter the distribution procedure.

About the time the leaves on the
Tulip Poplars began to turn yellow
last fall, Sophomore John Donato
stopped me as I was walking towards
the library.

“T want you to get somebody to write
a story on the way that everybody
always trudges around campus with
their eyes on the ground. How they
never look up to see how beautiful
everything is; they’re so tied up in their
own little problems.”

He had the look of someone who had
just bothered to look up himself after
spending a month with his eyes on the
ground. The sky was blue that day and
he seemed happy.

We talked a while longer and then
parted. As I walked towards the
library, I noticed that a lot of students
were just watching themselves put one
foot ahead of the other. And the rest
seemed to be staring ahead with an
empty glare, pausing only to mumble
“Hi” whenever in danger of running
into someone else.

But I never tried to get anybody to
do the story. i

February now, the springtime of
springtime, and as I was trudging
across the asphalt walk in from of Belk
Dorm with my eyes to the ground, I
just managed to swerve aside fast
enough to avoid running into a blonde
freshman with a psychology book in her
hand.

“Hi,” I mumbled in apology.

“Hi,” she replied, furtively lifting up
her eyes. She viuucnea thebook ‘to her

side and walked on.

I heard a Song Sparrow singing. Not
very far away. Sounded as if it came
from the bare trees by Watts. Yes,
there in the top, almost the highest
twig.

The sky was blue.

As I approached my eating house,
there was a Cardinal singing on a
branch right over the road. I forgot
whatever it was that kept my eyes on
the ground and felt happy.

Just after somebody asked me to
pass the tea at lunch, I noticed that
everyone seemed to be in a somber
mood.

“This is one of the first days of
spring,” I said.

No one lifted up their eyes.

“T saw a Song Sparrow singing on
my way down,’’ I said. ‘‘And a
Cardinal.”

Somebody reached for the biscuits.

“You know, it’s really bad the way
we take so many things for granted,’’ I
said. :

setting up a table in Chambers where
interested students and faculty may

pick up their copies, thus eliminating
monetary losses on unused magazines.

The two have also ‘‘sent out several
hundred subscription notices. (They)
have never done that before,’’ says
Daniels, but hope it will renew interest
and generate more readers and contri-
butors.

So life as a Miscellany editor consists
of subscription notices, ‘‘bills, rejection
slips, and (reading) tons of lousy

material’ sighs Barnes. But there are
lighter moments.

Take for example the lady who sent
in her crowning achievement —a story
dealing with people who cut off their
‘private parts.’ Or take the time when
the files were in such a mess that some
important correspondence was lost.

A letter indicating ‘a small fire’ was
sent to the two institutions involved,
who kindly reciprocated with the
necessary copies. And then there was
