NYT columnist will teach next semester

By NARESH NAGELLA

After a long search, the college
has offered the James Batten Visit-
ing Professorship to Tim Wicker, a
New York Times journalist.

He will teach two new courses
next Fall which will deal with some
aspects of journalism.

The course credit will prob-
ably come from the Center for In-
terdisciplinary Studies.

According to junior Matt
Hobbie, a student member of the
search committee, choosing a per-

son for the position is very difficult.

“We put a letter in the
Davidsonian asking for suggestions
and maybe a hundred very qualified
people were looked at during the
process. We then ranked the top 10
and gave the final list to President
Kuykendall. Everyone we looked

at would have been excellent
though,” Hobbie says.

Wicker will be able to lend first
hand insight to his classes consider-
ing his high profile “On Press” col-
umn appeared for 23 years in the
New York Times.

He graduated from the UNC
School of Journalism in 1948 and
hopes to shape the course around
“public policy and fundamentals of
the press and how the two interact.”

He suggested a course dealing
solely with journalism would be
hard to teach at an undergraduate
level because of what he states are
the “varied results of a free press.”

But, by framing his journalis-
tic knowledge in some type of spe-
cific context.he “hope[s] to better
relate and help students understand
the principles of that same free
press.”

“I hope to emphasize the

changes in our politics and press
over the last of half of the century.”

Wicker has never had any pre-
vious college-level teaching expe-
rience.

Hobbie believes that will make

the class even better: “It will help
him to be able to teach from his
experience. It is important that he is
not a [traditional] professor.”
' The James Batten Scholarship
provides a million dollar endow-
ment, the interest from which pays
for the new professor’s salary.

The scholarship is reserved for
one new professor for a whole year
every other year or one new one for
a semester each year.

Wicker says, “I look forward
to being able to possibly teach at the
college inthe upcoming school year.
It will be nice to take on new chal-
lenges despite my professional ca-
reer having finished.”

Wingate hosts Secretary of State

Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright spoke at Wingate Univer-
sity as part of the Jesse Helms Lec-
ture Series two weeks ago.

Taking a few jibes at her own
party, Albright said, “The chairman
[of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Helms] and I get along

4 very well. Afterall, he can square

dance and I’ve done the macarena
and unlike the Vice-President, I can

actually move.”

Albright outlined her foreign
policy agenda as keeping people
safe by defending threats to America
and its allies, prosperity by increas-
ing global economy, and freedom
by promoting American principles
and values.

Albright stressed the impor-
tance of ratifying the Chemical
Weapons Convention (CWC). Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Helms has “ridiculed the

ODK nomi-
nations for
teaching,
staff, and
community
member

due April 11.

available in
the library.

treaty and kept it bottled up in his”
committee, but “will let the com-
mittee vote on the Chemical Weap-
ons Convention after the Easter re-
cess so the full Senate can decide
whether to, ratify it,” according to
the March 26 Charlotte Observer.

“The CWC helps to ensure that
others will never use chemical weap-
ons against us and make it harder
for terrorist states to build or buy
these weapons,” she says.

“If we fail to ratify the conven-

tion by~April; we tose the right to -

draft rules by which the convention

. will be enforced,” Albright says.

The Secretary of State high-
lighted America’s foreign policy in
Asia, the Middle East, and Europe
as reflecting “not altruism, but real-
ism,” frequently calling it “bothright
and smart.”

Albright urged President
Clinton to support international af-
fairs programs, claiming that it is
“1% of the US Budget which af-
fects 100% of the American people.”

“Our goal is to see American
workers have a level playing field
on whichtocompete,” said Albright.
“If countries want to sell in our
backyard, they had better let Ameri-
cans do business in theirs.” :

Albright also addressed world-
wide abuses against women. “

“Some say this is cultural... I
say it’s criminal, and we each have
the responsibility to stop it,” said
Albright.

Albright used God’s still small
voice in the»story of Elijali ‘in the

Hebrew Scriptures as a metaphor
for the strength of America’s for-
eign policy.

She emphasized America’s
ability “to separate right and wrong
and believe in its heart in the birth-
right of every human being to be
free. Republicans and Democrats,
old and young, rich and poor, heed
that voice. Let us build a future on
what is smart and what is right.
Toward that end, I pledge my own
best efforts and ask your help.”

Hitting the homepage

The revamped college web
page can now be accessed, and stu-
dents are happy about the changes
in the new “virtual Davidson.”

Now at http://
www.davidson.edu web surfers will

_be greeted by a web page with pic-

tures of students and aclearer, more
graphical interface that lets them
access different information about
the College. |

_ The old page only featured the
Davidson logo and offered a brief
history of the school. The links to
other areas of the college were given
in a simple bullet list format.

Junior Sean Keesee says, “It is
really nice to see how fancy the web
page has gotten. Prospective stu-
dents will log onto these pages and
get their first impression of the
school. It is important that we make
sure it is the best it can be.”

The new web page has a fea-
ture that lets web surfers see how
many times each different web page
that works off the college server
gets “hit,”

The college web page is ac-
cessed over 700 times a day.

Junior Dave Jackson who has a
picture on the web page is very
excited about it.

“Overall, the new page has a
multidimensional quality that only
the best web pages can get. I would
like to see more moving graphics or
rotating pictures though,” he says.

Sophomore Fahd Gul hopes the
new page will get students more
interested in the internet.

“Students now have more ca-
pabilities to access the power of the
internet. They can set up their own
web pages and make sure theirclub’s
activities or events will be publi-
cized in the ‘News and Events’ sec-
tion. The page can only better aid
the campus’ communications and
reputation,” says Gul. .

Web page coordinators Ron
Chapple and Bryan Skelton will
appreciate student comments about
the page and can be reached at
rchapple @ maui.net and
bskelton@ robnorris.com.

Jerry Stockdale, director of
college relations, can also field opin-
ions at webmaster@ davidson.edu.
