Book As Gift

At the Inaugural Exercises

Davidson student body presented a
gift'to the school’s new President.

The result of voluntary contribu-

tions by the students, the gift was |

formally presented to Dr, Cunning-
ham by Al Winn, student body
president, during the Inauguration,

The student gift to the President,
was a’very beautiful, rare copy of
Pilgrim’s Progress. It is a 1796 edi-
tion with the plate engraved by
Wooley. It is of full straight grain,
red Morocco, with gilt edges.
Cunningham has expressed himself

as highly grateful to the Student

Body for this expression, and as}

warmly appreciative of that partic-
ular gift since it is one which he
will keep always with happy asso-
ciations.

ningham in New York some time
