Kuykendall reports year’ S events to Trustees

REPORT OF THE PRESI-
DENT TO THE DAVIDSON
COLLEGE BOARD OF TRUS-

TEES May 1, 1987 :

The pressure of the schedule
for our plenary session on the
morning of Friday, May 1, has in-
dicated that it would be better for
me to circulate this President's
Report in written form prior to this
meeting of the Board of Trustees.
With the exception of a few brief
comments and necessary updates
on matters of special interest, I
will try to limit my report on re-
cent matters of significance to the
following pages.

Admissions:

On April 1, a total of 605 let-
ters of acceptance were mailed to
successful applicants for the Class
of 1991. This group was drawn
from a total application pool of
2,013, of whom 1,206 were male
and 807 were female. You will be

interested to know that as com- -

pared with this overall acceptance
rate of 30%, almost exactly 50%
of candidates who listed relatives
who are alumni were accepted.
(While this does not represent suf-
ficient evidence to validate certain
theories concerning _ genetic
superiority, it does indicate that
Davidson alumni are giving prop-
er encouragement to their brighter
kin folks to consider their alma
mater!)

It is still too early to provide
any realistic estimate of what the
yield from the. first group of ac-
ceptances will be, though we may
be able to give you a progress re-
port on May 1. As has been the
case in‘recent years, we have a
very talented group of young
people who have been placed on
the waiting list, and we are op-
timistic about the make-up of the
group of 350 young people who
will comprise the Class of 1991.

It never hurts to remind ourse-
Ives of the incredible effort that
goes into the recruitment and
selection of each new class. of
Davidson students. In the course
of this past year, six staff mem-

bers traveled the equivalent of 174

days in 29 states between Sep-
tember 15 and December 15 and
the Spring schedule for travel has
included an additional 25 days of
programming in 15 _ states.
Beyond the work of our own staff,
we are deeply indebted to over
200 alumni/alumnae who have
worked in the 25 cities. with full
DAAP Teams and in a number of
other areas with liaison groups or
in individual efforts. This ap-
proach to admissions continues to
be a significant and productive as-
pect of Davidson’s program.

The search for a successor to
Jim Hendrix. as. Dean of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid has gone
extremely well to this point. It is

my hope that it will be possible for —

me to announce the appointment
of the new Dean either at the meet-
ing on May 1 or shortly thereafter.

Student Life:

At the Spring Meeting of the |

BOard last year, you adopted a
new alcohol policy which was
necessitated in part by the change
in North Carolina law concerning
the legal drinking. Subsequently,
- a policy. for Patterson Court ac-

tivities which was designed to i
consistent with the Trustee policy
was put into effect. As we come to
the end of the first year under
these new regulations, let me give
you a brief summary of reactions
to date. Several aspects of the new
College policy fostered a better
environment: Alcohol has been
less visible around the campus;
the 900 Room in the College
Union has experienced a revival

in

Bird’s eye y
under the leadership of William
Brown and his creative staff; there
has been more responsibility
shown by student leaders on Pat-
terson Court; and students have
apparently not been leaving the
campus in order to drink. Cer-
tainly the most important result
seems to have been a highly raised
consciousness among our students
about drinking and driving.

Such favorable comments,
however, are not intended to con-
vey the impression that there is no
linderage drinking on the David-
son campus. There seems not to
have been any great change in stu-
dent patterns in this regard. Those
underage students who wish to
drink either buy alcoholic bever-
ages illegally off campus or have
drinks given to them by students

_ of legal age. While the Patterson

Court officers have apparently
been conscientious in abiding by
the letter of their policy, there
seems to have been some “slip-
page between the cup and the lip”
in terms of actual practices at par-
ties on the Court. We will be giv-
ing some thought to the continu-
ing implementation of the policy
over the Summer, and will be pre-
pared to report further on the situ-
ation at the Fall Meeting of the
Board.

You may recall that this year

for the first time we instituted a ~

moratorium for five weeks with
respect to freshman participation
in activities on Patterson Court.
The plan was controversial at
first, but proved to be remarkably
successful, especially from the
vantage of our upper class stu-
dents. From the faculty’s point of
view there was a noticeable differ-
ence in the academic adjustment
of the freshman class over last
year’s class. The moratorium did

. seem to increase both noise and

damage problems on the freshman
halls, particularly during the latter
part of the period. From this
standpoint, it was probably a
week too long.

For next year, the Dean of Stu-

Davidson College

: dents is adopting a somewhat

modified plan. Freshmen will not
be allowed to attend events on the

Court until October 2, and then

only on weekends for the remiain-
der of the Fall Term. Further, stu-
dents who do not have a 2.0 aver-
age at the end of the Fall Term will
not be eligible for self selection
during Winter Term. We hope
that these measures will enable
new students to develop better

study habits and become involved
in a wider variety of campus ac-
tivities.

Several other steps are being
taken to improve the quality of life
for freshmen next year. Freshmen
men will be housed in portions of
two resident halls rather ‘than
being housed altogether in Belk
Dormitory. The. male Hall Coun-
selors have been educated more
intensely in their obligation to in-
sure cleaner and quieter halls, and
more stringent measures will be
taken against those who “trash”
halls and cause more serious dam-
age. These measures should help
educate the new class more effec-
tively about the proper care of
College property and sensitivity to
the rights of others.

The new Patterson Court
selection policy which was des-
cribed for you in some detail at the
Winter Meeting is now in place.
The committee of students
charged with monitoring and en-

- forcing this policy has been estab-

lished, and Hall Counselors. for
next year’s freshmen have been
briefed on the policy in prepara-
tion for their duties.

I have recently concurred with
a recommendation from the Coun-
cil on Campus and Religious Life
with regard to a petition for admis-
sion to Patterson Court by a group
of students interested in recon-
stituting a local chapter of Kappa
Sigma fraternity. These young
men have spent the past two years
in preparation for “colony” status,
and will occupy a house on Patter-
son Court for a probationary
period beginning in September.
They have done an admirable job
of completing all of the tasks nec-
essary to make this application
and join with the national frater-

nity in a genuine willingness to |

observe both the letter and spirit of
‘the self selection process. We
welcome them to the Patterson
Court circle and the larger David-

son community.

Any report on student life this

year would be remiss if it did not
include a tribute to the special
gathering of leaders in this year’s
senior class. As you well know,
Mark Sandy has been singularly
effective as the President of the
SGA. I have never known a stu-
dent leader who has commanded
the respect of peers, faculty, ad-
ministration and Trustees in“quite
the same way that Mark has.
Much the same can be said for

ag «g << r

Dan Murrey’s leadership of the Y
Student Service Corps, Michael
Holt’s courageous and efficient
leadership of the Honor Council
and Lucinda Kellam’s work with
the College Union. The Presidents
of the Patterson Court houses,
too, are a most impressive group
of men and women, who have
done a fine job of managing com-
plicated situations under the able
leadership of Fran Houck as Chair
of the Patterson Court Council.

The people who are emerging

to take over these jobs for next
year seem equally fine. I will look
forward to introducing Conrad
Doenges, the President . of’ the
SGA for next year, at the Meeting
on May 1.

_ Athletics:

We will conclude the athletic
year 1986-87 with three men’s
teams repeating the feat of twenty-
win seasons which they accom-

plished in the previous year as.

well. Our basketball team, as you
‘know, came within an eyelash of
another trip to NCAA post-season
play as champions of the Southern
Conference Tournament. While
there was some initial disappoint-
ment, the dominant sentiment
both among the members of the
team and the rest of us is that the

. Season was very gratifying. Our
baseball and men’s tennis teams

are now past the twenty-win
mark, and the remainder of the
season holds the possibility of a
better record in baseball than we
have ever experienced before.
Our women’s tennis team, after
last year’s difficult decision to up-
grade to Division I competition,
has risen to the challenge in mar-
velous fashion. They have entered
the Conference Tournament fresh
on the heels of a remarkable vic-
tory over the University of Ten-
nessee — Chattanooga team,
which was last year’s Conference
champion. Thus, for several of

our teams, it has been a most satis- :

fying year.
Kit Morris and I continue to

Friday, May 8, 1987 THE DAVIDSONIAN

work on the project of finding a
proper conference home for
Davidson for 1988-89 and there-
after. My personal conversations
with Colonial Athletic Associa-
tion presidents thus far have been
moderately encouraging, and
Kit’s work with the Athletic Di-
rectors has also served to build a
good foundation for a probable fu-
ture application for membership.
We appreciate the efforts of sev-
eral members of the Board who
have given us response to the re-
cent inquiry, and will likely be in
touch with you as the plans for our
campaign develop.
Institutional Advancement:

As you will see by the
schedule for the Spring Meeting,
our plenary session on late Friday
afternoon is given over to our con-
tinuing work in preparation for the
major campaign scheduled to
begin in 1988. The Board will be
participating in the sort of “focus
group meeting” which will be re-
plicated in more than a dozen
locales around the country during
the next few months. This is anes-
sential component in the feasibil-
ity study which will eventually
yield the case statement and pro-
posed goal which we hope to pre-
sent to you at the October Meet-
ing.

Ihave received a thorough and
thoughtful report from a study
committee on radio _ station-
WDAV which was chaired by
Trustee Ross Smyth. That report,
together with my recommenda-
tions for implementation, will
come to'the Board for your con-
sideration through the Institu-
tional Advancement Committee.
WDAV continues to be a major
agent of good will for the College
in many homes in Charlotte and
elsewhere, and it is certainly .
timely to give some thought to its
future at this juncture of its life.

The Institutional Advance-
ment Committee will also be re-
ceiving a draft of the proposal we
intended to submit to the Olin
Foundation, requesting funding
for a new facility to house our
growing programs in biology and
psychology. The Olin Founda-
tion, as you may know, chooses a
handful of schools each year, to
which it gives all of the funding
necessary to construct and equip
facilities which will be essential
parts of the academic process. No
school in North Carolina has ever
been successful in application for
an Olin grant, and we would like

for Davidson to be the first.

Finance and Personnel:

Ralph Holt and the members
of the Finance and Budget Com-
mittee have been at work since
your Fall Meeting with the advis-
ory group comprised of students,

* faculty members and administra-

tors, in a thorough review of the
Board’s policy with respect to in-
vestment in corporations doing
business in South Africa. The
draft of their proposed revision is
included in this packet for your in-
formation. The Finance and
Budget Committee will be pre-
pared to make some recommenda-
tion to you with regard to this mat-
