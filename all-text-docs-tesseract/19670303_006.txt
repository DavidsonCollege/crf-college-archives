BORDERLINE ACCEPTANCES
Point System Favors Athletes, Alumni Sons

By ROBBIE HOOKER
News Editor

Athletes who would not be ad-
mitted to Davidson ‘‘in the: nor-
mal process of events’’ are ac-
cepted each year. according to
two members of the Admissions
Committee.

However, the committee mem-
bers—Director of Admissions H.
Edmunds White and Psychology
Professor J. H. Ostwalt — were
quick to point out that all ath-
letes so admitted have been
judged fully capable of academ-
ic success here.

Football and basketball play-
ers and sons of alumni are
grouped by the committee in a
“special consideration’’ cate-
gory, White said. And although
these applicants have been ap-
praised as having sufficient aca-
demic potential. ‘‘we accept

some that we ordinarily might we

not have.”

Both White and Ostwalt stress-
ed the initial academic specifica-
tions that must be met by any
applicant before his application
is studied further by the com-
mittee.

“In evaluating any applicant,
first, we try to determine what
he's likely to achieve academ-
ically.” White said. “If he does
not pass that first test. we forget
him.”

“If we think he probably will
be successful—last year we had
at least 800 of these—then we
evaluate other things. We look
at what I call ‘whatever-else-
we-can-find-out-about-him’, char-
acter, integrity. personality—any
specific contribution he may
make."

and a member of Alpha Tau

Omega, Jennings has served on,

the Social Council since its for-

given athletes,”
Ostwalt.

He also denied rumors that
the point system works. to ad-
nit athletes who are not aca-
demically competent. ‘This is
not a surreptitious thing—there
is nothing crooked about it. All
{t does is keep some balance in
the number of athletes. The
same thing would be used if we
had enough of another kind of
applicant, like, say, musicians."

White and another member of
the committee, Dean of Students
Richard C. Burts, refused com-
ment on the point system. White
said, ‘‘There are a certain num-
ber of details. of course, but be-
cause they. might be misunder-
stood they are better not dis-
cussed.”

White termed the special con-

Editorial Stand Taken

Boyle

THE DAVIDSONIAN is more
than a polling service. more than
a bulletin board. Its function of
providing the campus with com-
plete and fair news coverage
must be strengthened. but its po-
tential role as a means of im-
proving the college and broaden-
ing the worldly perspective of
the student body must not he
short-changed.

If THE DAVIDSONIAN is not
just a bulletin board, neither is
it. a polling service. My differ-
ences with the present editor on
his stands on topics such as ath.
letic subsidization were based on
my belief that they were wrong.
not because they did not express
any supposed mood. of the stu-
dent body. When the consensus
of student opinion is reported, it
shouid be done on the news
pages as the objective thing as
it is. Editorial positions must be
taken not on the basis of con-
formity. but on. that of an in-
formed attempt at proposing the
best possible alternative. At the

same time. the expression of -

what other informed individuals
believe must be encouraged
through the use of regular col-
umnists and the type of column
which is exemplified by the pres-
ent Quo Vadis feature.

A local. sportscaster had a
burst of unusual insight recently
in pointing out that newspaper
editors want to improve the
world. That. is exactly. what I
want to do, but I want to start
right now with the part that I
know and that can be effected
by student efforts. The same
sportscaster went on to charac-
terize college journalists as soph.
omores. The students who co-
operated with me in the smooth
ly-operated news side of this past
year’s DAVIDSONIAN can at-
test to the fact that I am no
sophomore in technical profi
ciency as a writer or as a man-
ager. Now I want the chance to
demonstrate that an editorial de-
sire for improvement is not just
a sophomoric ideal.

The strength of a newspaper
lies in the quality of its report-
ing and in the journalistic tolera-
tion offered to all opinions re-
gardiess of whether they concur
with the announced editorial pol-
icy of the newspaper.

A primary goal of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN will be to reflect
the prevailing views on campus
from students. administration
and facultv. THE DAVIDSON.
IAN will be synonymous with
“The News and Editorial Voice
of the Davidson College Student
Body,’' rather than always be-
ing a lonely voice crying out
from the editorial page.

Objectivity will be the major,
aim of THE DAVIDSONIAN.
Guest editorials will give stu-;
dents and other interested indi-
viduals the opportunity to con-
tribute on subiects important to,
them. Letters to the editor are
a vital part of a newspaper, and
ertitorial policies will be formed |
to encourage reader response,.
both positive and negative.

Desnite the relatively small
size of the student bodv. David-
son needs factual reporting of
campus events. THE DAVID-
SONIAN will feature interpreta-
tive reporting of events which
every student should understand.
These reports will be concise,
featuring the important subjects,
without insinuations from head
lines or reporter.

Other basic aims of next
year's DAVIDSONIAN include a
simplification of style in order
to present more news through
utilization of excess white space,
and integration of departments
so that important events will re-
ceive the notice they deserve,
regardless of the nature of the
events, be it sports, feature or
general news.

With proper administration
and toleration of all views, THE
DAVIDSONIAN can be the vital
campus element that it should
be. With the experience I have
had in both news and sports,
plus the extensive professional
experience I received during two
summers, I feel I can print a
newspaper that students will

according to sons of alumni “entirely right

and appropriate.”

“As for the sons of alumni,
their families have been asso-
ciated with Davidson for a good
many years and we have an ob-
ligation to them. Concerning the
athletes, there are several pro-
grams which this college is
sponsoring that involve a good
bit of the college’s money. We
think it appropriate that poten-
tial contributors to these pro-
grams be given special consid-
eration.”

The general policy and pro-
cedures of the six-man admis-

sions committee are reevaluated
each fall, White said. The other
three members are English Pro-
fessor Frank Bliss, Director of
Student Counseling W. B. Hight
and Math Professor J. B. Stroud.

He also stressed the commit-
tee's ‘“‘complete contro! of who
is accepted. ‘‘We have control,
regardiess of who the guy is,
who his parents are, how tall he
is, how far he can throw a foot-
ball.

“Not a single year has passed
that we haven't told both coaches
that we would not accept one of
their prospects, sometimes even

2 Represent Davidson
In Student Legislature

For the first time in three
years the Student Council has
sent delegates to the N. C. State
Student Legislature being held
in Raleigh this weekend.

Sophomores Fletcher Hartsell
and John Roe will represent Da-
vidson among the 32 other col-
leges and universities attending
the convention.

“Although we have been affili-
ated with the S.S.L."" Hartsell
said, ‘we have not. been able to
get students to go since the leg-
islature has met on the same
weekend as Midwinters..

“Since the student body de

cided to withdraw from the Na-
tional Student Association last
year,’ he continued, ‘‘we felt
that this was one way Davidson
could make contact with the
student governments of other
schools in the state."

The legislature debates bills
concerning such topics as low-
ering the voting age to 18 and
**brown-bagging."* the topics be-
ing suggested by each school at-
tending the convention. Bills
which are passed are sent as a
bloe to the N. C. Legislature for
consideration.
