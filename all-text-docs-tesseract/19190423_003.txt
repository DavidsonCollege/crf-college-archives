EU. SOCIETY.

The Eumenean Society held its reg-
ular meeting in the hall last Saturday
night. Those that were present seem-
ed quite conspicusus among so many
empty seats, ‘The election of officers and
the moving picture show made it neces-
sary to cut the program short. “Che sub-
ject for debate was: “Resolved, That stu-
dent government is better than faculty
government.”

The affirmative was upheld by R. R.
Craig and B. T. Liston, ‘Their argument
was sound and showed evidence of deep
thought, however not original on their
part. The points were: That student
government gives boys training needed
in later life; that the students are ca-
pable of governing. Most of their time
was spent trying to prove that faculty
government is not the best.

The negative was ably defended by G.
M. Robison, J. P. Price, W. P. Cum-
mings. Their principal points were:
Boys are not capable of governing them-
selves; that you cannot rely on or. trust
students on critical questions; that school
room honesty should be dealt with by the
‘faculty; that student government is in-
consistent; faculty government guaran-
tees to the student the standard of a di-
ploma, which by student government is
greatly lowered.

The debate as a whole was good. It
showed evidence of a little preparation,
which is quite uncommon for society pro-
grams. Very little authority was quoted
except that by Mr. Cummings who quo-
ted very frequently from Mr. Bitzer as
his authority.

After the program the house entered
into the election of officers for the fall
term of year 1919-1920, with the follow-
ing result.

President—A. S. Asque.

Vice President—J. R. Boulware, Jr.

Treasurer—C. A. McGirt.

Secretary—G. N. Atkinson.

Critic—W. B. Sullivan.

PHI SOCIETY.

At the regular meeting of the Phi So-
ciety Saturday night, the subject for dis-
cussion was: “Resolved, That student
government is superior to faculty form
of government.”

McCain and Long upheld the affirma-
tive by showing that it was democratic,
necessary and practical.

The negative. upheld by Howell, and
Garth, claimed that the faculty being
older and more experienced could carry
out a better form of government. The
judges voted unanimously in favor of
the affirmative.

Following the debate was a declama-

tion by Freeman. His subject, ‘Citi-
zenship"—by Roosevelt, was very ap-
propriate, but a lack of preparation was
evident.

T. R. Alexander gave a timely ora-
tion on Norsemen mythology.

Booker and Wool in an_ extempor-
ancous debate, Resolved: “That all stu-
dents. of Davidson College should be
compelled to stay for commencement,”
showed very clearly that they would
not remain,

‘The. affirmative, upheld by Booker
lost by a vote of three to nothing.

In the absence of the critic Dunlap
took his place, ©

‘Teach a girl to dance and she will
dance. Hence if you teach a man to
fight he will fight. While the Fresh-
Soph. debating teams were trying to
prove the truth or falsity of the state-
ment it was being amply demonstrated
on the campus. The R. O. T. C. may
be able to stimulate war conditions but
it cannot even reach the height of per-
fection reached by the Rumple-Georgia
feud.

General McCloy of the Rumpleite
army, acting under the international law
that any unclaimed land is -ubject to col-
onization, made claim to a bench in the
name of Rumple. he President of the
Republic of Georgia sent General Cul-
lum to investigate Rumple's claim to the
aforesaid bench, After investigation,
General Cullum reported that Georgia
could rule the bench better than the
Autocratic Rumple. The necessary or-
ders were immediately issued and it was
seized. Rumple retaliated by reoccupying
the territory and declaring war. Georgia
mobilized her forces and General Me-
Gloy made a strategic retreat to his for-
tresses and called on “Goliath” Sherrill
for aid. With one mighty sweep of his
hand Goliath broke asunder the innocent
bench which had caused so much dis-
tr actionfrom studies. He then challenged
any of the enemy to single combat. “Da-
vid” Douglass accepted his first challenge
and waded into him without waiting for
his slingshot. He found the weak place in
Goliath’s armor, then struck the fatal
blow.

Rumple, through her King, immedi-
ately sued for peace with status quo ante-
bellum terms which were accepted apd
the treaty signed.

LIBRARY NEWS.

This week's list of new books cover
such a wide territory that everyone
ought to be interested by one of them at
least. The list is led by two volumes on
history: “Economic Development — of
Modern Eurtpe.” by Ogg, and ‘‘Amer-
ican World Politics,” by Weyl. There
are two works on education, “Business
and Education,” by Vanderlip, and ‘“Vo-
cational Guidance.” by Puffer. Also
“The Bible and Universal Peace,” by
Gilbert. “Bible in English Literature,”
by Work, and “Juvenile Peace” by
Beebe. Lastly there is ““The Destinies
of the Stars,” by Arrhenniess, an interest-
ing work for students of astronomy.

CAMPUS IMPROVEMENTS

Along with nature’s touches to the
campus we are glad to see several good,
practical improvements. The drainage
of the walks has been cleaned out to
insure better walking during the spring
rains. The steady job of keeping cut
the vast expanses of grass has been start-
ed. To the delight of the many tennis
players, new back-stops have been put up
at several of the tennis courts. These
new back-stops were certainly put up to
stay and do good service. Iron poles have
supplanted the wooden ones and extra
heavy wire stretched upon them. The
paint brush has left its work here and
there, greatly brightening things up.

‘They were sitting in the parlor,
Where the light was low and dim,
She seemed to be contented,
And no murmur came from him,
“George.” she asked, “Are you report-
ing
For that horrid paper yet?
It is shameful how they publish
All the scandal they can get.”
“No. my love.” he answered softly,
And he winked unto himself,

“DT have. left” (in fact that morning
They had laid him on the shelf).
“But. he said and hugged her closer
She returning the caress,
“Just at present [am working
