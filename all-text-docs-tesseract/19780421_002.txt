Debate duo takes second

The team of Maria Patterson and Nancy Warren took second
place in the First International Women’s Debate Championship
held April 14-15 at Barnard College, Columbia University in New
York City.

Patterson, captain of the Davidson College Debate Team, took:
the second place speaker award with a total of 151 points, only
three points behind the first place speaker, a Berkley student.

Professor of Speech and Debate Team Coach Jean Cornell said,
‘Maria was funny, logical, a real wit. During her speech in the final
debate people were clapping and whistling. I’ve never been to a
debate where people got more excited.”’ ;

Three topics were debated and each team took the negative and
the affirmative position once on each topic for a total of six rounds.
One topic was that ‘‘the Federal Government should provide
assistance to any woman requesting an abortion.”” Also debated
were the resolutions that ‘homosexuals should be allowed to adopt
children” and that ‘‘single sex colleges are obsolete.”

The D.C. team had a 5-1 record going into the final round against
Berkley. The teams debated the abortion resolution with Davidson
taking the negative position. According to Cornell, the round was
extremely close.

Patterson commented, ‘‘The intellectual caliber of the debaters
was high. It was a lot less tense than on-topic tournaments and
there was a lot more camaraderie. The tournament was very well

Avinger
calls grant
‘adequate’

By DONALD CALDWELL
Staff Writer

The Center for Special Stud-
ies announced this week that it
has received a $6,000 grant to
fund a fifteen month study on
“the impact of business deve-
lopment on _ small town
growth.”’

The Center received the fund-
ing from the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company Education-
al Grant Program. Other recent
recipients include Brown Uni-
versity, the California Institute
of Technology and Williams
College. :

Professor of Economics and
Dean of the Center Robert
Avinger noted that the original
application requested $12,000
but that the $6,000 allotted
coupled with grants from other
sources would be adequate.

Additional topics for study
within the project framework
are racé relations, life styles,
the environment, education,
and government.

The central factor to be
analyzed is the effect of large
cities upon towns on the peri-
phery of the metropolitan area.
Although other towns will be
examined to some degree, the
Center chose Davidson because
of its proximity and relation-
ship with Charlotte.

Avinger pointed out that
‘Davidson is unique in its
problems but not unique in the
sources of those problems. We
hope to discover information
that can be published and made
available to other towns.”

He also noted the educational
aspects of the work. ‘‘Even
though this is relevant from the
point of view of what's going on
in our community, it is relevant
educationally as well. It affords
an opportunity for interdiscipli-
nary study by both faculty and
students.”’

‘We are not trying to take an
advocates role. We are attempt-
ing to look at things such as
housing, zoning, and political
participation and identify op-
tions that can be taken.”

Wellford addresses
Spring Convocation

By KIRBY OWEN
Staff Writer

Professor of Music William
Lawing sounded his trumpet
and the Class of 1978 proceeded
into Love Auditorium for the
Spring Awards Convocation of
1978.

The invocation, led by
YM/YWCA President Glen
Darbyshire, was followed by a
welcome given by SGA Presi-
dent Bruce Brown.

The convocation address was
delivered by W. Harrison Well-
ford, a 1962 graduate of David-
son. Wellford now serves as
Executive’ Associate Director
for Reorganization and Man-
agement of the Office of Ma-
nagement and Budget. In this
position, he is responsible for
Federal regulatory policy, ma-
nagement improvement, and
reorganization.

His address concentrated on
the problems he has encoun-
tered while directing the
streamlining of government
bureaucracy. He described the
problem of having so many
interest groups and the lack of
funds available to them.

He added that he was trying
to work from the inside to the
outside and that it was proving
very difficult.

Addressing the seniors, he
emphasized that he was invol-
ved in a service job that he
believed was very rewarding.
He encouraged them to include
this thought in their future
plans.

Following Wellford’s
address, an anthem was sung
by the Male Chorus. Then the
presentation of awards began.

..Meetze reveals
plans for changes

(Continued from page 1)

Regarding housing, Meetze
commented, ‘‘We will need to
add visible fire signals.’ The
lower rooms could be fitted with
ramps to make existing areas
available, he added.

Other areas to be looked into
are parking, and. the redesig-
ning of restrooms for Cham-
bers, Cunningham, and the
Lake Campus, Meetze pointed
out.

We'd like to begin installing
some of these devices even
before next term."

Meetze pointed to the fact
that accessibility does not mean
a handicapped student must get
to the upper levels of every
building. This can be accom-

plished by such means as the
reassignment of classes, he
said,

“If youtry to make the whole
campus accessible,’’ commen-
ted Meetze, “you'd almost have
to build a new campus.”

According to the Act, ‘An
institution is not required to
make structural changes in
existing facilities where other
methods are effective in achie-
ving program accessibility."

“We want to move cautiously
and not into a big program,”
said Meetze.

“It calls for close cooperation
between those planning the
academic program and the phy-
sical plant program.”

There were four honorary
degrees given: John McCorkle
Akers, Doctor of Laws; Romare
Howard Bearden, Doctor of
Letters; Charles Franklin
Myers, Jr.,Doctor of Laws; and
Benjamin Hill Thurman, Doc-
tor of Science.

Wellford received the Distin-
guished Alumni Award. The
Thomas Jefferson Award was
given to Professor of Education
and Psychology, J.H. Ostwalt.
