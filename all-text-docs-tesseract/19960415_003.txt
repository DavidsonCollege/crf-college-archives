recommendation will result in a
very minute change in our policy.
There were some Changes that we
had to make in order to uphold the
integrity of Davidson, decrease
liability, and maintain a safe envi-
ronment for Patterson Court —
and I think we’ ve done that. I am
happy with the recommendation.”
The CCRL also recom-
mended that shut-off time for
weekday parties be extended to
1:30 a.m. from midnight, and that
risk managers be provided by the
houses and serve “on a rotating
basis.” They also asked that po-
lice officers patrol the Court in
“zones” as opposed to one officer
attending each party — this would
reduce costs for each house.
CCRL members hope that, if

ment, including at least one course
at the 300-level or above.

Students may declare only one
minor and must maintain at least a
2.0 cumulative grade point aver-
age. It specifies that pursuing a
minor precludes pursuing a double
major or a concentration.

Not all students are pleased
with the result of the vote. Senior
Katie Tobin, who has been in-
volved in the minors debate
through her work with both the
Academic Affairs Council and the
Educational Policy Committee,
does not support the institution of
minors at Davidson. "I do think
[minors] threaten a liberal arts
education," she says. "I think
[minors] may threaten concentra-
tions... one of the neatest aspects
of our curriculum."

However, on the whole, stu-
dent excitement runs high. War-
ren Buford, President of SGA, calls
the vote a “great testament to hard
work and good open communica-
tion between students and faculty.”
Buford adds that “‘a lot of people
need to be thanked for their ef-
forts.”

accepted, this policy would please
most everyone involved. "We
haven't [recommended the ban of
kegs] without considering any-
thing else," says member Senior
Peter Vemney: "That is hardly the
case."

However, he stresses that this
is not the final word. “It’s not a
decision, but a recommendation.”

Before these decisions were
made, a well-attended open forum
was held on Tuesday, April: 2 con-
cerning the alcohol policy.

The forum offered an oppor-
tunity for those gathered to dis-
cuss the present alcohol policy and
address the keg issue and was
meant to be an informational ses-
sion about the findings and recom-
mendations of the self-study con-
cerning the alcohol policy.

Among the panelists were
Beth Bell, Assistant Director to
RLO and Advisor to Patterson
Court, Bart Landis, General Coun-
sel, John Cowan, President of
Patterson Court, and Sara Beth
Hamlin, Union Board President
and subcommittee member. Dean
Shandley, Vice President for Stu-
dent Life, arrived later to join the
panelists.

Many students seemed to dis-
credit liablity threats and blame
the banning of kegs in Courthouses
as amove to end Patterson Court.
Bell insists, “this is not about end-
ing the Court, but about saving the

Court. We must play by therules.”

She says many have misinterpreted
the administration’s intent, which
concerns the interests 0

Trustees will decide on tenure

By NaresH NAGELLA AND
KirRSTEN RECKNAGEL
Assistant News Editors

Among other issues at their
meeting this week, the trustees will
vote on whether to grant certain
professors tenure.

Each faculty member on a
“tenure track” contract must wait
six years to receive word on
whether they will receive the right
of permanent employment.

This guarantees the professor
to say what he or she thinks inside
and outside the classroom, “‘with-
out fear of reprisal or loss of em-
ployment,” according to guidelines
provided by the Dean of Academic
Affairs’ office. After receiving the
promotion, an Assistant Professor
becomes an Associate Professor.

Dean of Faculty Robert Will-
iams says, “There are two major
benefits to tenure: they protect the
academic freedom of the faculty
and the provision of job security
‘(for the professor).”

Six professors are up for ten-

ure this year. They are: Jonathan

Berkey, History; Mauro Botelho, —

Music; Scott Denham, German;
Vivien Dietz, History; Ken
Menkaus, Political Science; and
Janet Shannon, Anthropology/So-
ciology.

Despite its benefits and its al-
most universal use in higher edu-
cation, tenure has now become a
controversial issue in academia.

Some universities are having
problems with what are termed as
“deadwood” faculty, who, after
receiving tenure, simply let their
performance slide. 5;

When they can not be fired,
these professors might show little
interest in their students, not main-
tain current knowledge in their
field, or focus more on research
than teaching.

Davidson, however, maintains
the high quality of teaching by
creating performance-based incen-
tives for professors to keep up their
high standards after receiving ten-
ure. There are no automatic salary
increases at Davidson — all salary

increases depend on merit.
According to Dean Williams,
“The increases range from 0% to
15%. That's the one leverage that
we still have (to maintain the high
quality of teaching).” Theoreti-

- cally, it could lead to a ‘professor

with 30 years experience making
the same as one that has taught for
only 8 years...

'_.. Trustees.ultimately: award ten-
ure, but their decision is based on
recommendations from President
Kuykendall.

Kukyendall, in turn, hears
from Dean Williams and depart-
ment members. Excellence in
teaching (based in part on student
evaluations), maintaining a qual-
ity of scholarship, and service to
the community are the basic stan-
dards: which all. professors. must
show to receive tenure.

~ However, at’ Davidson most
emphasis is put upon the quality of
teaching. Dean Williams stresses
this. “You cannot get tenure at
Davidson without being an excel-
lent teacher,” he says.

national fraternity organizations, in-
surance companies, and the col-
lege.

Some students expressed con-
cerns about an end to the unique
Davidson social life, characterized
by open parties and free flowing
beer. Most agree that a ban on the
keg would spell closed parties anda
rise in pre-party drinking in resi-
dence halls.

Many feel uninformed and ex-
cluded: from..the: decision-making
process. As Rix Threadgill says,
“We need a clear line from the col-
lege. What control do students
have? It seems like we have none.”

Other students fear the many
committees, whose representatives
are mainly appointed, may confuse
and complicate the communication
of student concerns.

Although most students recog-
nized the probability of a keg ban,

many belive the school is being too

hasty in deciding an alternate policy.
Should the CCRL's recommen-
dation be accepted, most of the fears
expressed at the forum (except for
the keg ban) will be allayed.
Nevertheless, CCRL member
and Union Board President Sara
Beth Hamlin says, “This was a very
important forum and I’m very glad
to see such student input. All the
opinions were valid and in the wake
of minors, such student input and
action can be very effective.”
“This is a way to give the houses
leverage in making their own re-
sponsibilities.” he says, “Our re-
sponsibility was getting in line with
insurance.”

“The Conversion of St. Paul,” a translation and contemporary adapta-

formed outdoors on the front portico and grounds of DCPC. Like the
medieval original, the DCPC production is notable for its memorable por-
trayal of the comedy of evil and of erring human pride, for its use of dance to
mark scene divisions, and for its involvement of the audience who will
ptocess along with the narrator from “Jerusalem” to."Damascus" and who
