WEEK.

GAMES OF THE

All Davidson fans were very pleas-
antly surprised to learn that an extra
ball game will be played on the Hill this
week. Manager Shaw has obtained a
date with Weaver College for Vhurs
day afternoon, ‘“Vhis team is now on a
ten-day (il playing games with Oak
Ridge, Guilford and other teams of
equal strength. “Ding” Bell, a ‘13 man
and ‘a star pitcher while here, is coaching
the Weaver team, and reports have it
that he has a strong aggregation under
his wing. A large number of fans from
Concord are expected over to view the
game since both Coach Bell and Coach
Fetzer are from Concord.

Next Saturday will bring the second
scheduled base ball contest of the season.
The opponent met will be Horner Mili-

tary Institute, a preparatory school in],
Charlotte.
Although this school has a student

body of only about seventy- five men, the
report is given out that Horner has an
exceptionally strang team this — year.
‘Their greatest strength lies in the pitch-
ing staff. ‘he batting, of the team is
alsa far above the average and ta tact
measures up te a fine standard,  “Vhe
squad they bring with them will prob
ably number about twelve. “Chis team
has now been in training for over a
month under Coach Natress, and is ne
doubt in Hine form. They will) come
down on the 12:50 train fron Charlotte
and return th: " tight

Much to the disappointment of all.
the game booked with the Buffalo Feds} W
has been cancelled. “Phe game was to
have been played in Charlotte, but since
that city is in organized base ball and
the Federals are fighting organized ball,
the Charlotte management felt that: they
would be aiding the Federals if they
yave part of the gate receipts to Buffalo,
therefore they decided not to allow the
giune to be plaved on their field.

GYM TEAM 'FRIP.

The Gym ‘Team has been putting in
some hard practice since Christmas and
has finally arranged for a trip to Lenoir
on March tg. ‘The team is to go under
the auspices of the: Lyceum Rureaw at
Lenor and are to be entertained at the
homes of the good people of the city.
The Orchestra and Glee Club have
made several very successful trips to
Lenoir, and -it is expected accordingly
that the Gym T
well attended.

NEW DEBATING COUNCIL.

At a recent meeting of the new debat-
ing council the officers for. the next year,
‘TY. D. Sparrow, chairman, and J.
Patton, manager, were elected. “T he}
council is busy with plans for some good
debates for next vear. The new mem
bers of the council from the two. socie-
ties are: Neal, from the Philanthropic;
P. B. Price and Hagood, from the Eu-
mencan, good debaters who should make
a substantial addition to the council.
Although as yet nothing definite can be
known, the signs are favorable for a
debate with ‘Prinity and = Washington
and Lee next vear. Debates will be
arranged with these two colleges or with
some other colleges of Virginia, North
Carolina or Georgia. Under our three-
year contract we will of course have a
debate with Clemson next year. The
men on the teams have been working
hard for the past few weeks and have

nearly completed their . arguments, and
prospects are good for victories over
Clemson at Rock Hill next Monday

(April 5) and Emory at Agnes Scott
the following Monday.
