| Question

of the Week

What do you think of the method
used this year by the Y. M. C. A.
to raise the Christmas Gift Fund
for the Leper Colony?

As explained in Chapel Monday
-morning, the Y. M. C. A. this year
is placing the emphasis in raising
the money on the spirit in which
it is given. There is to be no can-
vassing or use of the pledge cards,
and no contest will be staged be-
tween the dormitories or between
the classes as in the past. The “Y”
wishes the donations to come from
a_ spirit of Christian generosity
rather than from any other motive.
Shorty Parrish, Sophomore:

I think that ‘it is a finesidea, be-
cause of the fact that it will leviate
some men of the embarrasement of

not being able to give as much as,

their next door neighbor. Also
this method will bring out the true
religious spirit of the "College; all
the hypocrisy and feigning will be
diminished, it will set forth that
quality which makes for a sincere
Gift Fund,

Bob Doty, Junior:

The idea. sounds very well, but I
hardly think that it is as practical
as the method used in the former
years. Of course one like»to think
that every man will give because
he wants to give and for no other
ulterior motive, but at the same
time, common sense says that if he
has a little more urging he would
be much more apt to give. If the
Y. M. C. A. board wishes to gain
its goal it would save itself a great
deal of trouble by abandoning this
idealistic means of achieving it.
Mack Otts, Sophomore:

Contrary to the past methods of
contesting between dormitories and
between classes, this new plan will
bring out a real giving spirit. Now
there will be no.“forcing” to give
just because of the boys on the
hall or your roomate have contri-
buted to this program. Every man
will know what he wants to give,
and therefore no pecuniary difficul-
ties will be involved in the spirit
of the gift. No one will be under
any obligation to give, the
whole plan should be a great suc-

and

cess.
Marshall Houston, Senior:

I think that the spirit of the gift
is vitally important, but that more

money would be raised by last
year’s method. Nor can I see how
theg goal that the Y. M. C. A. has

set for this fund can be realized
from such a plan. Every student
has that spirit that the “Y” wants
to bring out by this plan, but I am
dubious as to its outcome.

Many students, including myself,
will neglect or forget to contribute
unless canvassed. I feel sure that
the former plan has been successful,
and that there is no logical reason
for abandoning it. The true Christ-
ian spirit of Charity cannot be in-
stilled by this new method, and
cannot be harmed by the old.
Hunter Marshall, Senior:

This plan, while very idealistic
and all that, seems less practical
than the one used in former years
of canvassing. and contests. More
people would be likely to give by
this old plan too. I'd be much more
likely to donate if someone were
to come around to my room to see
me about the campaign and to tell
me about its purpose and its aims
rather than to just sit in chapel and
hear about it for a few minutes.

I do not feel that the spirit is
lessened in any degree by the for-
mer plan. The fund would be
larger if canvassers were used, and
speaking from a money viewpoint,
the other plan is far better. Of
course, if the whole program is to
be based entirely on a “spirit of
Christian generosity”, then maybe
the present plan as adopted by the
Y. M. C. A. board is more suitable.
John Withers, Junior:

The spirit giving idea is a splen-
did-thought-on the part-of the “Y”
cabinet, but I feel that it would be
better to keep the men reminded
of the fund and of its object in the
former way of canvassers rather
than by seeing the gift boxes in
the Student Store and in the lobby

At the regular meeting held on
Tuesday evening, December 6, in

reports on some phase of the sub-

fore the group. Various speakers
dealt with the religious, ethical,
moral, and social aspects of the
situation, basing their comments on
material gathered from the news-
papers and from other periodicals
such as “Time” and “Life.”

After this topic had been thoro-

Unexpected]

Cancellation Due To Lack of
Equipment, Poor Condition
of Gridiron

With interest, excitement, and

rivalry arising to fever pitch, with

temporary bleachers being erected
to take care of the capacity crowd,

and with the rival gridiron stal-
warts arming themselves to the
teeth for the conflict, the annual

football classic between the Watts
Tea Hounds and the Georgia Rats

for the second straight year was
| called off.
Lack of proper equipment and

failure of the gridiron to be in good
condition were given as the official
reasons for the cancellation of the
contest. However, staunch

NO CAPTAIN

Rumor has it that there will be
no permanent football captain of
the 1939 edition of the Davidson
Wildcats.

Dave Warden was captain dur-
ing the 1938 season. The election
of the captain is usually held at
“D” Club banquet,

time no one was

the annual
but at that
chosen to succeed Warden.

In the event that no one is
elected before next fall it
probable that a different captain
will) be chosen for each game,

thus giving more men a chance
at this honor.
