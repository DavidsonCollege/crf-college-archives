The grass on the campus as it stands
now was sown in 1877-78, but for several
years it was treated as a meadow and not
as a lawn. In 1884 the receipts show
$108 as having been received from hay
produced on the campus.

If the awarding of letters is conducted the

chase 35 acres of land adjoining the pres- |
ent college property. This tract is known
as the Cowan tract, and lies immediate-
iy north of the golf course, and will be!
used to improve the course. Agreements |
have already been reached concerning |
the purchase, and the land will be sur-,
veyed within a short time.

This land will enable two more holes
to be established, one of which will be
550 yeards long. It will permit number |
one to be cut out, making the present |
second hole number one, the first drive |
being 480 yards. One of the principle
criticisms of the local course has been
that it has no long holes, and the new
circuit will give Davidson two.

Hole number will used as

hack and forth between two holes, and
not interfere with other golfers.

Another improvement is that the golf |
course will be fenced. The fence has ar-|
rived, and it is expected that it will be
around it by April. The new course will |
not be ready for use this scholastic year, |
but those in charge state that it will |
probably be ready for use in the fall. |

be able to teach others also.” He ex-
plained that a minister is not a produc-
tive worker like a farmer, but he is like
a doctor or teacher. He does not raise
grain but still he is the most important
of all. Then showing that a minister
must have piety, a clear mind, a thorough
training and good education, he gave and
explained an outline of the courses
taught in theological seminaries and
closed with an explanation of the ques-
tion, “How can a man decide whether he
should be a minister or not?”
