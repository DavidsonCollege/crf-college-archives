Though Hood officials will

Keynote Speaker at Med Humes
Discussion on the "Rights of Death"

By Casey Otis

On Wednesday, guest speaker
Dr. George Keynote spoke on the
topic “What are the Rights of
Death?” as a continuation of the
Medical Humanities Series.

Keynote isthe chairman of bio-
ethics atthe Cleveland Clinic foun-
dation. He discussed the impor-
tance of bio-ethics concerning the
rites/rights of death. He stated,
“times occur when families must
make decisions between life and
death - literally.” The program
was highlighted by a half hour
VCR presentation called “No
Heroic Measures”.

The video presentation was a
fictional case study dealing with a
woman who was nourished and

treated through a nasal gastral tube.
The woman’s niece wanted to get
acourtorder that ordered the nurs-
ing home to disconnect the ma-
chine and release her aunt of suf-
fering. There were a lot of “gray
zones” in the case according to
Keynote, and the question of “best
interest” was the most essential to
him.

Before the presentation Key-
note raised three basic questions in
reference to the case study: “Who
do you find sympathy with?”,
“What is the moral question in this
case?” and “What arguments are
the most convincing?”. Keynote
called the ordeal “a judgement
process of value assessment.” He
also stated that most medical pro-

cedures are subject to the pitfalls
of ethics”.

The presentation was followed
by a provocative question and
answer
session. Keynote asked the audi-
ence what would be best for all the
parties concerned, and difficult
questions were asked on the rami-
fications of a decision. Keynote
stressed that “unfortunately, ev-
eryone finds that they will be chal-
lenged by the hardest decision in
the world.”

Keynote closed by saying that
he believed that these questions
and his field need much more at-
tention.
