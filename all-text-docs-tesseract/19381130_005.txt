Dr. Lyon Lectures On
Love In Final Speech

Takes Text From I. Corinthi-
ans In Third of Series of
Sunday Talks

Last Sunday morning Dr. S.
C. Lyon concluded his series
of lectures in Sunday School.
The subjects for the first two
lessons were “Faith” and
“Hope”: Last Sunday’s  les-
son was on “Love.” Dr. Lyon
took his text from I. Corinthi-

ans 13.
Faith Necessary
As Dr. Lyon stated in his pre-
vious messages, Faith is necessary

for a belief in all intellectual know-
ledge including a belief in God. Al-
though we can not prove the very
existence of God, we are justified in
having a rational Hope — of
through the observations on the or-
ganization of Nature.
The existence of Love
important that either Faith or Hope.

Him

is more

Although the existence of love is
impossible to be proved; its very
existence is doubted by nobody.

Nobody doubts the love of a mother
for a child. No scientist would dare
deny that love is more real and is
a more deciding factor that any of
the transendental facts such as
energy, space, matter, or time. The
properties of these elements are
measured by such devices as the
foot rule, the pound’or the minute:
The properties of Love are infinite
and can only be compared to a
beautiful picture or a symphony of
music.

In closing Dr. quoted I
Corinthians 13:13, stressing the use
of the word “abideth.” “But now
abideth Faith, Hope,
three; and the greatest of these is}
