Konert’s big day not enough for Wildcats Parity never more

Ray FRANCcIs
Staff Writer

The Davidson Wildcats football team was once again
plagued by turnovers Saturday, giving the ball away three
times and falling to Dayton 41-22. Davidson also dropped a
35-29 overtime decision to Valparaiso the previous week.

Flyers’ quarterback Rob Florian proved unstoppable as
he torched the Wildcat defense for 200 yards and two touch-
downs on 21-24 passing while adding 51 yards on the ground.
He also had a rushing and receiving touchdown.

Davidson was led by Ryan Alexander ’09 who threw for
394 yards on 32-49 passing, three touchdowns and a pair of
two-point conversion passes. He also threw two intercep-
tions. Kirk Konert ’09 had 10 receptions for 153 yards and
two touchdowns.

Andrew Aldrich ’10 added eight catches for 66 yards and
Justin Williams ’11 scored a touchdown on a 12-yard recep-
tion. Ben Sarver ’11 and Mark Hanabury *11 caught conver-
sion passes.

The Flyers raced out to a 41-0 lead by taking advantage of
turnovers and strangling the Wildcat ground attack. Davidson
was held to 37 rushing yards on 24 attempts. Wildcat coach
Tripp Merritt called the Dayton front seven the best he had
seen in the league. The Flyers got 10 points off of turnovers,
including a 77-yard return of Alexander’s fumble by Sean
Heenan to cap their scoring.

Alexander came back on the next offensive play to find
Konert, who broke several tackles and raced 66 yards for a
touchdown. The two then combined for a 10-yard score on
the next drive. After Alexander’s interception in the red zone,
his 12-yard strike to Williams ended the scoring.

“Dayton has been a consistent contender in this confer-
ence for a long time,” Alexander said. ““They’re well-coached
and execute very well. They just played better.”

Merritt was proud of the effort his team showed in the
fourth quarter to rally, but added that they need to play better
over four quarters. The defense, for example, did not force a
punt until nine minutes remained in the fourth quarter, and
did not force any turnovers.

The loss was particularly bitter because it came on the
heels of a heartbreaking road loss to Valparaiso. The Wildcats
held a 21-3 lead before surrendering 26 unanswered points
to the Crusaders. Davidson tied. the game on Kenny Man-
tuo’s ’11 one-yard touchdown run and Alexander’s conver-
sion pass to Konert, but lost in overtime when Alexander was
intercepted by Anthony Curry.

Despite Machel Turner *10 scoring the first goal of the
evening and securing a lead going into halftime against Fur-
man on Oct. 10, Davidson could not come out on top, eventu-
ally falling to the conference foes 2-1 at Stone Stadium.

Returning home the following Wednesday, Davidson
faced off against the Elon University. Going into the night,
the Pheonix had an impressive 5-0-0 SoCon record and would
improve to 6-0-0 after defeating Davidson 2-0.

At the 3:07 mark in the first half, Elon’s Erfan Imeni
struck with their first goal off a pass from Aaron Parker. After
the first goal of the evening, nearly 60 minutes went by with-
out another score. This period of the game was very defen-
sive with many scoring attempts by both clubs.

One of these scoring attempts for Davidson came right be-
fore halftime when Mark Millard ’12 led a fast break only to

Day against Radford.

Ryan Alexander ’09 passed for 394 yards and three
touchdowns in the Wildcats’ 41-22 loss to Dayton.
Bames ’09 added 75 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.
Alexander hit Williams with a 32-yard screen pass for a
score, but he was intercepted three times.

Aldrich led the receivers with four catches for 50 yards.
The Crusaders were led by Ross Weimer, who rushed for 170
yards and three touchdowns on 22 carries. Valparaiso rushed
for 351 yards on 57 carries.

Mantuo and Barnes paced the Wildcats in the first quarter,
each rushing for a nine-yard touchdown as Davidson took a
14-0 lead after the first period. Williams’ touchdown recep-
tion gave his team a 21-3 lead before the Crusaders added a
field goal to make the halftime score 21-6.

Weimer scored on runs of eight, 49 and 17 yards to give
Valparaiso a 29-21 lead in the fourth quarter. Alexander made
good on two fourth-down conversions as he drove the Wild-
cats down the field for the tying score.

Jake Riedel scored from two yards out on the Crusad-
ers’ overtime possession. The extra point was no good but
Curry’s interception rendered that point moot.

The two losses bring Davidson to 2-4 overall, and 1-3
in the Pioneer Football League. The league season continues
this Saturday as the Wildcats fly to Iowa to take on Drake.

Alexander said that practice for Drake would likely in-
volve focusing on “a recommitment to basic fundamentals,”
but is confident Davidson can compete, “(If) we stay disci-
plined and play consistently.”

Tyler Lemons °10, the leading tackler from the Dayton
game, agreed, adding, “We just have to cut down on the little
mistakes.”

have his shot blocked by Elon’s goalie. In the first half alone,
there were eight shots on goal combined for both teams. The
defense was so strong though that the score remained 1-0.

The last goal of the bout came at the 61:47 mark when
Elon’s Justin Wyatt performed a sideways bicycle kick to put
Elon up 2-0.

Although Davidson lost, goalie Robby Goldsberry ’10
registered five first half saves. Davidson outshot Elon 11-10
in the match including a 6-3 advantage in the second half
alone.

On Tuesday, Davidson welcomed the defending cham-
pion Wake Forest University Demon Deacons. This was a
tough matchup as Wake is ranked Ist in the nation this sea-
son. The Deacons boast an undefeated record (13-0-1), tied
only by Duke University. The Deacons improved their record
to 14-0-1 after handling the Wildcats by the score of 3-0 .

The ’Cats take on Presbyterian and Appalachian State in
the week to come, looking to get back on the right track.

I give up. It just does not make any sense anymore. Every
time I think I have it figured out, something happens that just
boggles my mind. How can the National Football League be
so unpredictable? The players are all professional athletes,
and fans have had years to evaluate them. It is truly amazing
how wrong the experts can be every week. I mean, it cannot
be that hard, right? Well, let’s recap the start of the NFL sea-
son and examine.

Quick, who’s been the best team in the NFL over the first
seven weeks of the season? Count me among those impressed
if you quickly answered with the Tennessee Titans, the lone
undefeated team at 6-0. The Titans cannot be considered an
enormous surprise, as they went 10-6 last season, but what
about the usual suspects?

The Patriots, I suppose, can be forgiven. Any team that
loses the reigning NFL MVP (Tom Brady) for the entire sea-
son can be forgiven for an unimpressive 3-2 start. The Colts,
though, have stumbled to 3-3 even with star quarterback Pey-
ton Manning. The Browns, who are coming off a resurgent
10-6 season? Try 2-4, with little to hang their hats on except a
35-14 throttling of the Giants, the reigning Superbowl cham-
pions.

Speaking of those Giants...expected by many to take a
step back this year after their incredible run, they have shot
out of the gate to 5-1. Dominant through their first four
games, they lost in the aforementioned blowout to the then
1-3 Cleveland Browns.

Make any sense at all? No. The Browns had been abso-
lutely awful to begin the season, and then blowout the pre-
sumed best team in the league at the time? It was borderline
inexplicable.

The best individual example of this season’s craziness is
the Washington Redskins. Breaking in a rookie head coach
and with an unproven quarterback, the "Skins were written
off in the preseason by many. The media blasted the Redskins
after a terrible close to the preseason, and even the devout
fans (like me) expected little from this season.

The Skins, though, are 5-2 and boast road wins over Dal-
las and Philadelphia. Even my beloved Redskins, however,
lost at home to the 0-4 Rams.

This brings us to Dallas, which has a 4-3 record that hides
their significant struggles. I confess, Dallas’ implosion could
be predicted. Any team that harbors Adam “Pacman” Jones,
Terrell Owens, and Tank Johnson in a locker-room with a no-
tably weak-willed coach is a disaster waiting to happen. The
Cowboys’ two straight losses to Arizona and St. Louis have
got me smiling, to say the least.

Many pundits had the Cowboys and Patriots as the two
best teams in the league. Others expressed their opinion that
it would be the Colts, the Chargers, or the Packers. None are
currently leading their division. They’ve fallen victim to hot
starts from the likes of Buffalo and Chicago, whom few had
expected to contend.

Here’s another example of just how unpredictable this
season has been. CBS Sportsline NFL writer Pete Prisco has
hit on 62.8 percent of his picks this season. Those have been
straight picks, meaning he did not pick against the spread. I
will be the first to admit that 62.8 percent is a reasonable av-
erage, if a bit low. But wait. There’s a catch. Prisco has by far
the best record of any major media pundit this season.

These experts did not suddenly lose their ability to ana-
lyze football. They have been reduced to simply average be-
cause of the general unpredictability of today’s NFL.
