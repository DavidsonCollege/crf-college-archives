T. E., Tom Downie, was elected president
for the coming year. President

A number of names of
juniors were brought before the club as
possible new members. In connection with
the discussion of new members the club
passed a ruling which makes it necessary
for all candidates to have an average of

ruled that only members of the Senior
and Junior Classes would be eligible for
membership.

of those men whose were sug-
gested at the meeting, and, if they have
an average of 85 or above, they will he
