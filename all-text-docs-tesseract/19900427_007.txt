David Thompson | Rude Notes & Scribblings

Students, Stand Up For Your
Rights: We Can't Have Firearms

I, like most of you, got a little
tired of the dead space in The
Davidsonian, and so I decided in
collaboration with the new regime
to,write a semi-weekly column so
that we might be spared further
documentation ofSig Eproad trips.
Thank me at your convenience.
Anyway, this column probably
won't please everyone. It’s cer-
tainly, not for Puckettheads (an
eloquent defense of the inner
beauty of smokers is planned for
the fall), and those who can actu-
ally say the words “President Re-
agan” with a straight face might
not find me all that funny. lintend
to direct my comments to rational
people witha slightly warped sense
of humor. Any of you who agree
thatbothof America’s Jesses should
be institutionalized for the public
good will, hopefully, enjoy what I

have to say. (Those of you who
would find a secretdelightin their
sharing a cell will definitely enjoy
itmore.) Now that I’ veintroduced
myself, let’s start with thoseissues.

The Residence Life Office of
Davidson College, as stated in our
housing contracts, refuses to allow
the students to keep firearms in
their rooms. You should be out-
raged! Have you no concept of
liberty? Howdare thecollegeclaim
that wearebeing taughtand treated
as adults if they won’t let us keep a
.38 in the closet? How do they
expect us to have any fun? Know
they not the joy that comes from
nailing the clock on the north side
of Chambers from the fourth floor
of Belk? Can they not understand
the thrill of squeezing off a few
rounds outside a fraternity home-
coming party? Obviously not. They

on’t even let us keep a puny .22
on campus. The R.O.T.C. people
get machine guns, while the rest of
us aren't even allowed the occa-
sional bottle rocket to relieve the
stress of student life. Stand up for
your rights fellow students! Buya
gun today!

Letter ofapology to follow each
installment:

Please forgive me for my
thoughtless and rather callous
remarks dated___. The'subject of
___is very serious indeed, certainly
not something to be taken lightly
or mocked. My comments were
made in jest, and I did not attempt
to offend any readers.

Sincerely,
D.A. Thompson

Questions, Advice
and Burble

SARAH BAYNE ‘90

Before | take the final walk
down the aisle that leads to the
“real world” I would like to take
this time to pass on a few words
advice, raise some questions, and
burble about life at Davidson...

* Why, if the student body is
obviously supportive of recycling,
doesn’t the Commons have any
recycling facilities? Ata dinner I
catered recently, the contents of
many, many wine bottles/were
imbibed ina spirit of jocularity, yet
Carleton Pritchard madeno effort
to recycle any of them. (And un-
fortunately Jennifer Longest was
not there to make sure that these
bottles found their way into a red
recycling bin, as shenormally does
when catering.) Come on
Pritchard, wake up and smell the
Diet Coke—recycle.

* Listen to your mother. And
your father. And your grandpar-
ents. And then figure out what is
right for you.

* Minus grades would bea bad
idea. Davidson students are neu-
rotic enough about grades as it is.

*Why is The Davidsonian edito-
rial board all male now?

* Learn and obey the Code of |

Responsibility.

*Why notnametheapartments
North, East, and South?

* Come to “Celebrating 18
Years of Women at Davidson”

FAC. Friday, April 27th, 2-5 p.m.

Union Patio. Free food and drink.
Dancing, music, and writings of
Davidson’s women,

* Support the arts. We’re en-
tering a visual age.

* Why are prospectives told
that the fraternities are self-se-
lected?

“Why do both the Commons
and the Union Cafe insist on using
styrofoam cups, trays, etc.? Even
McDonalds has paper cups. I’d
rather deal with a little condensa-
tion onmy Coca-Cola than have to
use a container that will not break
down until...well until our yellow
sun turns intoa big red star, swal-

|| lowing our disposable diaper, sty-_
rofoam infested world.

*Don’trun/walk/jog aloneat
night (male or female). Bring a
friend or stick to the track.

* Condoms can now be found
in the First Aid cabinets in the hall
bathrooms (for those of you who
have not yet noticed them).

* The existence of chocolate
proves there is a God.

* Study abroad for at least one
semester (preferably a year).

*One day, you too will gradu-
ate.

*When will the Bookstore start
selling. recycled paper products
(other than greeting cards)?

* Davidson: needs a female
police officer.

* Why was the minus grade

‘referendum scheduled for thesame

night as concert choir? Is the SGA
aware that suchscheduling under-
mines the activities of their con-
stituents?

* Ruth Pittard and Debby Sink
know just everything concerning
the college. If you have any ques-
tions one of the two of them will
usually have the answer.

*Will the Trustees ever divest?
Why aresome of them members of
country clubs that discriminate
based on race, sex or religion?

* What is Doug Jobe doing as
president? Is he really following
through on his campaign prom-
ises? Does he really and truly care
about student concerns? What is
he doing with the SGA budget?

*Will M&M Soda Shop ever be
open again?

* Will Baker Sports Complex
ever be a fully opened reality?

* Why is Tom Gattiker (a.k.a.
Mr. Union Cafe) reluctant to con-
tinue the great discount on soda

refilled in the recycling cup? Are
profit margins more important:
than helping the earth? Students
will not use the cups as often un-
less thereisa significantamount of
money at stake. Keep the 35 cent
(at the most 40 cent) refill price.

* Ray Thrower is doing a fan-
tasticjobas new DavidsonCollege
policechief. Everywhere you look
these days you see a Cushman on
patrol.

* Bring back the term system!

* Davidson needs a supermar-
ket.

* For the last time...girls and
boys, ladies and gentlemen, men
and women...,BUT NOT GUYS
ANDGIRLS.

* Don’t worry. Be happy.

Goodluck toall you Davidsoni-
ans and to quote the pop culture
icon Dennis Miller...lam outta here!
