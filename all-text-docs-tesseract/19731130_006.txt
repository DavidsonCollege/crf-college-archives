Energy Crisis

talk about all the ‘‘good’’
that’s going to come out of the
energy crisis and how it’s
really a ‘‘blessing in
disguise’. Humbug!

These Pollyannas looking
through their rose colored
glasses tell us that the energy
crisis will revive passenger
train service, cause us to
rediscover the joys of walking
and allow us to breathe clean
air again, since there won't be
any Cars around.

I agree that if the above
come about (and I have
serious doubts that they will)
then these will be beneficial
results, but look at the cost!

(as Gov. Holshouser put it),
many have seemingly forgot-
ten that not every family has
two big gas guzzling cars nor
does everybody have a
vacation retreat to go to every
weekend.

that a middle class family is
willing to ‘‘sacrifice”’ one of its
cars or is willing to drive less.
But what about the man
from the lower or lower-
middle class family who must
depend on his car to get to and
from work?

Unfortunately, thanks to the
highway lobby and the auto in-
dustry which has opposed
mass transit, the car is not a
luxury but a necessity to many
in our society.

But the poor like everyone
else must sacrifice in this time
of national emergency, and it
doesn’t matter if they don't
have anything to give up.

To those ecologists who see
the energy crisis as a once ina
lifetime opportunity to curb
the auto, a statement by the
president of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce should prove in-
structive.

Speaking on Monday after
Nixon’s speech, he said that
Nixon had not gone far
enough, and that what was
needed was the end to price
controls on gasoline and home

pollution regulations, the re-
institution of offshore oil
drilling (like off Santa Bar-
bara), more strip mining and
a number of other measures
that would aid big business.

Of course Nixon has asked
for a relaxation of anti-trust
and conflict of interest laws
against the oil companies,
theoretically because this
would help solve our energy
problem

It looks like Nixon will
finally get what he has always
wanted — business and gover-
nment in bed together. Big

government and big business
marching in lockstep, the
facists in Germany never had
it so .

In December of 1972 prior to
being inaugurated for the
second time, Nixon gave an
similar ilk, self-discipline and

“exclusive” interview to the
“‘Washington Star News’ in
which he said the American
people were just like children.

What we needed, he said,
was more self and
more sacrificing. Well, it looks
like Der Fuhrer will get to im-
plement his_ ill-conceived
value system despite the loss
of his ‘mandate’.

Naturally like all those of

It’s easy to see how Don Siegel’s ‘‘Charley

Varrick” could be made. The heroes are
super-studs and the women are pliable (ex-
cept for one militant old lady who spends
her dotage in valiant defense of her
chastity).

There’s enough sex and four-letter
language to satisfy the masses without

his creation.

He adds other details to make the visuals
more interesting such as an involved stair-
case, a set of swings, and a game of table
tennis

These are photographed with a nice open-
air feeling, but in the end we are left without
a movie.

Walter Matthau is miscast as Charley
Varrick and his comic talents wasted. The
supporting players, with two exceptions,
give rather bad performances.

Joe Don Baker is suprisingly good after a
miserable performance in ‘Walking Tall’’,
and Marjorie Bennett is well-cast as
Varrick’s senile neighbor. With a fine sense
of the absurd, she intones, ‘‘Roll me over, in
the clover. Roll me over, lay me down, and
do it again.”’

“Charley Varrick” is now playing at the
Village Theater in Charlotte.

or in his jet to Disneyworld
earlier (where he should have
stayed to save us from his fan-
tasies).

What is most unfortunate
about the energy crisis
(besides ing us to
Davidson for the weekend) is
that it comes at a time when
much remains to be done in
this country.

With the passing of af-

both at home
and abroad might as well be
thrown out the window with
the Christmas lights.

What is somewhat
remarkable about all this is
that the American people have
taken the bad news in good
cheer (probably out of
ignorance stemming from
believing Nixon’s lies, which
hide the true seriousness of
the situation).

We have been told in the
past that we get only five per-
cent of our oil from the
Mideast, but it turns out to be
more like 20 percent.

Nixon has said that within 10
years we will be totally self-
sufficient and will not have to
depend on oil supplies from
abroad (from our ‘‘enemies’’
as Nixon once put it in a
Freudian slip).

Hell! By that time I will be
31, and the best years of my

life will have slipped through
my fingers.

Henry K where are you

There is a Reverend Ike in
Boston who says, ‘‘I promise

That’s my kind of religion,
and my question is what is
Nixon going to do to keep me
from freezing this winter?

Those who continue to look
on the ‘‘positive”’ side (as if
there were one) remind me of
the Jews who thought the gas
chambers they were being
shoved into were showers.

While those who want to can
go dancing into the gas
chambers, I, for one, will go
fighting, protesting, and
yelling all the way.

Freshmen Criticize
Self-Selection Rush

To the Editor:

This letter is directed more
to the college administration
than to the eating clubs of Pat-
terson Court. We had delayed
peer it until all rush ac-

were completed in the
hope that something would
happen.

It was our overall im-
pression that the majority of
the houses lacked any basic in-
terest in attracting freshmen
members.

The house members were
very demonstrative during the
rush to the extent of offering
beer, PJ, grain and various
other niceties.

However, there was very lit-
tle follow-up to this initial con-
tact witha freshman.

A visitor to any given house
during rush could expect to be
asked his name and dormitory
but the interest in him, for the

‘Most part, seemed to end
there

We began to wonder where
the blame for this apparent
apathy lay. The answer
seemed to be the college ad-
ministration since the policy
of self-selective eating houses
was formulated there.

Members of houses do not
really care about rush, for the

most part, since they have no
Say in who becomes a mem-
ber of the house. Why should
they push for certain in-
dividuals to become members
when the only criterion for
membership is an individual's
place in line?

Despite the valiant efforts
on the part of the ad-
ministration to ensure that all
freshmen were exposed to the
Patterson Court , the
fact remains that all were not.

Granted students gravitated
to the rush parties where beer
“flowed —— like water’’ and
grain “like an everflowing
stream.” The point is that
nothing was accomplished.

To put it bluntly, it is the
fault of the system of self-
a that rush did not

ill its purpose. At least,
rush could have been like any
other advertisement for a
public restaurant.

It was, however, not even
— most cases.

houses go through the

motions and the freshmen are

no better informed than
before.
