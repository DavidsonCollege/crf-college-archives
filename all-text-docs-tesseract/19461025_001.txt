5. Students
Enjoy Hay Ride

At a gathering sponsored by the
Myers Park Presbyterian Church
and under the management of Miss
Eleanor Belk, D. R. E., fifty-five
Davidson students spent an enjoy-
able Saturday evening on an old-
fashioned hay

ride:

from Queens College and the fun
began when eight wagons pulled

couples moved out from the church.

Their destination was a spot in
the country where upon arrival
ample soft drinks and sandwiches
were provided for all. This, in ad-
dition to greup singing and- inei-
dental entertainment, gave impetus
to an ever-growing spirit of fun
and frolic.

The return trip was made with
no drop or change in the merry-
making and fond farewells were
bid to the girls after they reached

the set date.
