Flasher, larcenies add
to campus crime scare

By Jeff Kent

In the past week there have
been several larcenies and other
various crimes across the Davidson
campus. Residence Life recently
sent out a memo warning students
of suspicious characters and un-
registered solicitors.

Although this mini-crime
wave has not reached epidemic
proportions, police warn students
to be on the lookout.

The crimes include several lar-
cenies of wallets, book bags and a
bicycle, as well as an incident of
vandalism and even a flasher. Most
of the larcenies occurred either in
academic buildings or in the li-
brary, where unattended articles
were taken from offices or open
areas.

The police department stresses
that with these thefts, students and
faculty should take precautions to
secure their valuables and keep an
eye out for suspicious-looking
characters,

The flasher exposed himself
to an unsuspecting pedestrian on
Monday, April 11 at 9:15 a.m. on
Jackson Court. The perpetrator
remains unidentified, but there

have been no other reports of _

flashings since that time.

This week, Richard Terry of
the Residence Life Office sent out
a memo concerning solicitors on
Davidson campus. Dean William
Terry says that there have been
“more incidents of uninvited and
unwelcome solicitors” on campus
this semester than in years past.

He cites at least four such in-
cidents this semester and says that
police have had a few uncomfort-
able altercations with the solici-
tors.

of the students and their posses-
sions. The solicitors often wait
outside of residence halls until
someone lets them in, then wander
the halls unattended.

Although no specificinstances
have been reported, these sales-
men, who often work for “fly by
night” type of operations, have the
pvtential to enter dorm rooms and
remove items or harrass students.
Dean Terry stresses that any stu-
dents who encounter solicitors
should immediately call Residence
Life or the campus police.

The Dean of Students Selec-
tion Committee submitted its fi-
nal recommendation to President
Kuykendall after the three final
candidates for Dean recently vis-
ited Davidson.

The final candidates came “to
see Davidson life, meet the Presi-
dent, and meet the students,” says
committee member Eric
Rosenbach.

Dean of Students to be
approved by Trustees.

The long process in search of a
new Dean will draw to a close at
the meeting of the Board of Trust-
ees on April 21 and 22. The
President will make his recom-
mendation to the Trustees, who
will then vote on the issue.
Rosenbach says, “Ultimately,
it is the President’s decision on
who the new Dean will be. We
[the Selection Committee] only
serve as an advisory committee.”

Spring Frolics defies dreary forecast

By Phoebe Dean

Students, faculty, and staff
made “Much Ado About Nothing”
this weekend at Spring Frolics, in
spite of threatening weather pre-
dictions which materialized on
Friday.

The festivities began on Thurs-
day evening when acoustic guitar-
ist David LaMotte performed on
the patio behind Vail Commons.

On Friday afternoon, although
the start of the show was delayed
by a thunderstorm, Vertical Hori-
zon opened for Jackopierce at Ri-
chardson Field. People played fris-
bee, threw footballs, and hula-
hooped; others enjoyed eating,
drinking, and sitting in the sun.

The Human Gyroscope was a
popular attraction. “My friends on
the wrestling team paid the man

five dollars to try and make me

sick,” laughed Os Prioleau, who
had just eaten at the Waffle House.

Friday night, the Cultural
Events Committee and the Inter-

Houses do not serve food by rules

By William Robert

According to N.C. State Stat-
ute 130A-249, Patterson Court
houses would receive low marks
for food preparation and serving as
well as for general sanitation.

Section 2609 of the statute
states that food preparers “shall
use clean, plasticdisposable gloves
or sanitized utensils during food
preparation.” The cooks at most of
the houses rarely, if ever, use plas-
tic gloves when handling the food
throughout the preparation process.

Food served in a buffet or cus-
tomer self-service fashion must, in
order to meet the sanitary man-
dates, “be protected in such man-
ner that the direct line from the
customer’s mouth to the food be
intercepted by. glass or similar
shields.” These shields serve to
protect the contamination of food
“by customers’ coughing and
sneezing.” They can vary in style

from those in the hot meal serving
line at Vail Commons to those.

over the Commons’ salad and al-
ternative bars.
Such protections do not exist

at any of the houses on Patterson
Court; there, food is simply placed
on a table for public.consumption.
Members of Pi Kappa Alpha serve
themselves in the kitchen, which
violates Section 2610 of the North
Carolina Administrative Code.
Aside from Rusk and Phi Delta
Theta, none of the houses provides
covers of any sort for food contain-
ers in the intervals between the
serving of one individual and the
next. The statute also explicitly
states that at the conclusion of a
meal served buffet-style,
unconsumed food left on the serv-

ing line “shall be discarded.” This
mandate differs dramatically from
the policies of various houses. The
best “leftover policy” of the houses
investigated is that of Rusk where
they throw out all leftovers after a
24-hour period, Phi Delta Theta
keeps any substantial leftovers for
two to three days. Connor waits
until Sunday before discarding their
leftovers; others save theirs for one
calendar week. The most unsani-
tary scenario is at Kappa Sigma
and Pi Kappa Alpha, where left-
overs remain for unspecified length
of time.

“Tropical Paradise.” About 200
people enjoyed the South Ameri-

success.

“It’s great to see so many

On Saturday, the band Rear

sponsored a Midnight Breakfast at

‘ Davidson Outdoors organized
two trips this weekend in conjunc-

to Stone Mountain.

Enjoying the unexpected sun-

Spring Frolics “the perfect excuse
