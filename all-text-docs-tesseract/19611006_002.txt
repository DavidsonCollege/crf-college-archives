Concerning ‘Fresh’ Freshmen

In only a few weeks our “cocky”
freshmen .have stirred ripples, even
waves on the smooth, cool waters of
Davidson tranquility.

They have criticized our system
and tradition with an unusually fresh
eye and unaccustomed enthusiasm.
We, the Establishment, have replied
with the accustomed vigor that their
enthusiasm is unusually ‘‘fresh.”

Freshman criticism does perhaps
lack the depth of experience. It is
impossible to understand Davidson
tradition in three weeks. It is impos-
sible to know all the history or have
collected all the facts. Freshmen, be-
ing four years younger than Seniors
cannot be expected. to- criticize with
senior maturity.

But a man new io Davidson has
two great advantages in his vouth and
inexperience--the ability to criticize
independent of the system and en-
thusiasin.

The change from freshman to
upperclassman, the fitting-in to our
system, implies learning to live with

Needed: Cure For

The new Cunningham Building
is about ready for dedication. A rash
of “fine arts’ will mark its debut in
two weeks. But. after Oct. 27, what
happens?

Let's be honest. Unfortunately,
Davidson is “culturally” sick. True, we
have several fine lecture series. There
are an abundance of clubs and organ-
izations. But the “fine arts” overall
fare badly.

In the past year we have seen a
rejuvenation in one area, dramatics—
but only through a dedicated, prodig-
ious, back-breaking program. And la-
bors are being rewarded this fall with
renewed emphasis on dramatics, ‘a
new department, and an encouraging
student turnout.

Yet, still, art and music—with the
glaring exception of the Male Chorus,
which has a healthy reputation and a
week-long spring tour—are not in!
Playboy pinups are the extent of “art
appreciation” indulged in by most-
Davidson Gentlemen. And classical
music doesn’t stand a chance against
rock and roll.

If we expect the new building to
mean anything at all to the average
student, some ambitious plans and
programs must be initiated. The whole
student outlook and orientation to
“fine arts’ will have to be changed.
The cure and recovery will take time,
even with careful prescription.

Naturally, much will depend on
the nature and, quality of programs
presented. The concert band has a

good nucleus. In fact, each year there
is a promising freshman turnout; then

some of its incongruities, but we go
further. The incongruities, the injus-
tices become our accepted norms.

Having ‘fit in,’’ we settle into a
routine of lethargy, and indifferent
mediocrity. The enthusiastic fresh-
man becomes the tired senior.

The process of trimming down
the freshman has begun. He will be
honed to Sharpness, reduced to Cool-
ness, oiled to Smoothness.

Before the decay begins, the Es-
tablishment can learn from its neo-
phytes. We can gain from their new
look at us and their open enthusiasm.
Let’s at least give them an unbiased
hearing.

Davidson is embarking on new
seas of opportunity. It needs young
navigators.

To the Freshmen we can offer
the counsel. of experience: Change is
unwelcome at Davidson. We. can also
offer a challenge: Davidson can be
changed.

L. K.

‘Culture Anemia’

as the neophytes discover that the
band isn't “in”, they quickly fade out.

Perhaps improved facilities and a
new, enthusiastic director can alter
this trend. Yet a lesson should be
learned from the Vagabonds. A num-
ber of ambitious, well publicized pro-
grams should be begun as soon as pos-
sible with a “differ8nt” approach.

Charlotte is nearby with ex-
ceptionally wide and varied offerings.
which all too frequently go unnoticed,
or it’s tod troublesome to get tickets.

The new building could furnish a
ticket office that would publicize local-
ly all concerts, plays, art shows and
the like in nearby areas. Provisions
could be made with Ovens Auditorium
for this office to handle ticket sales
here on the campus. Most of these
series—Charlotte Opera, Symphony,
Oratorio Singers. Theatre League—
have special rates for students any-
way.

In the realm of art. a boost could
be furnished with a Davidson-sponsor-
ed state collegiate art contest. It would
Show off the new building, aid our
problem and furnish a real art serv-
Ice. Students from schools all over the
State would be invited to submit en-
tries with distinguished art personali-
ties judging. These could be displayed
and winners announced at a special
weekend. conference which would
feature noted art lectures.

We can’t step right into the Cun-
ningham Building and derive much
immediate benefit, regardless of how
fine the stage might be or how excel-
lent the acoustics. We have to cure a
“culture anemia.”

Faculty Votes Its Confidence

Faculty action was, taken this
week to implement recommendations
made by last year’s Honor Court (see
page one). These recommendations
Scott Lacy, past Court chairman, and
Harrison Weliford, present chairman,
presented to the faculty last spring.

Although the faculty at that time
unanimously accepted a statement of
policy concerning pledged work, there
were no indications that several other
proposals would be acted upon. Speci-
fically, the problem of using old re-
views or repeating reviews for make-
up sections was not tackled.

This week the faculty heard a
strong recommendation from its Judi-
cial Committee on this very issue.
When this proposal is carried out it
will provide a much-needed clarifica-
tion of a serious problem.

Last year's Honor Court report
ealled attention to these practices
which were called “encroachments on
the Honor System.” We think Lacy
and Wellford can be proud that the
faculty has been so willing to show its
faith in our Honor System to adopt
their statement of pledged woix and
their recommendations for improving
the test system.

Although this year’s Honor Court
has already drawn heavy fire, it has
shown its continued desire to develop
at Davidson a workable, effective code
of honor which will apply to all parts
of campus actlyity. We trust faculty
support will be ferthcoming on other
Serious recommendations — recently
presented by the({Court. Meanwhile,
the students and the Honor Court
have received a vote of confidence.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Trotter Protests Double Threat;
Spirited Frosh Not Frightened

Trotter

Dear Editor:

I had originally drafted a
very lengthy letter seconding
and defending Mr. Jan. Papra’s
letter attacking the Honor
Court. It would seem that a
modification is in order how-
ever, as both sides of the issue
have already been drawn to
such an extent that anything
further of value could not be
added by my feelings.

It need only be said his yiews
were set forth with much more
evidence of thought and serious
concern than is true with the
usual letter of vehemence. He
not only attacked his subject, he
suggested just and sensible
measures tu.remove the cause of
his displeasure — measures
which showed his sincerity.

His letter was a move of
courage and conviction. and as
such, was obviously destined to
be sniped and snarled at as soon
as it appeared in print.

There are, nonetheless, two
points—side issues if you like—
stenmming from this letter which
need airing. One: Naturalty Mr.
Pepra did not get to hear the
full story of the Honor Court—
of its attempt to teke into con-
sideration extenuating circum-
stances; none of us did.

The assembly talk by which we
freshmen were introduced and
indoctrinated. into this “tradi-
tion” was caleulated to terrify
us into shape. It seems to be
part of the system here. (At our
first Vespers, we were told in
the most positive and persua-
sively preachers-can-be-OK-guys-
too terms, that the coming years
would be “the worst of your
lives.””)

We were treated to a detailed
and carefully enumerated ac-
count of what would happen to
us if we were guilty of an hon-
or offence—point after point
was read in appropriately’ judi-
cially grim tones, telling us just
how useless it would be to con-
tinue living if we were dismiss-
ed from this school, just how
painful and horrible it would be
to face family, friends, life itself
under any conditions.

There was no mention of ex-
tenuvating circumstances, only a
rigid, monolithic Threat. Many
of us left that assembly think.
ing: Just what is Davidson Col-
lege that it should have the
power of God Almighty to wreck
an entire life by a simple, sur-
gically private amputation of a
man’s future?

Two: Some of the letters dis-
agreeing with Mr. Papra either
insinuated or openly stated that
he had no right to speak-out or
take the initiative. Who, pray,
does?

The act of writing that letter
demonstrates that this year's

Freshman class may not be as

susceptible to the Davidson
System as previous ones have
been. The ‘Davidson Gentle-
man” does not exist; he is «
myth. Thank God... .

But whet represents him? 1
belleve 1 can speak from more
than “three weeks’ experience”
for t have tived in Charlotte my
entire life and heave seen these
specimens meny times.

They fill our upper middle

class executive positions, they
are smart, (but. not too intelli-
gent), they teach our Presbyter-
ian Sunday school classes, ‘they
dress nicely, they are Clean-Cut,
and for the most part they are
hopeless mediocrities.

The secondary importance of
Mr. Papra’s letter is that it may
foretell the advent of a current
of fresh air, circulating through
the rusty verbal ivy of David-
son. It represents an open voice
of dissatisfaction.

Bob Stone has already intimat-
ed that this class shows too
much spirit sometimes. Might
this not be translated that we
are not above speaking out when
we feel like it? ;

Does not Mr. Papra’s letter
show that some members of the
Freshman class are not going to
let themselves be made into
symbols of a ragged concept of
“well-rounded”, “liberal (?)"
education? But perhaps it does
not—-indeed siready the stamp
of luke-warm similarity may be
seen on the faces of some who
were, a few months ago, almost
individuals.

Yes. it may be “unfortunate
that one who has been here.only
three weeks” speaks out violent-
ly against what he considers,
rithtly. to be awkward, unjust,
and sadly in need of reform and
clarification. But how much
more unfortunate that those
who have been here three years
speak out so seldom. And fin-
ally, how outright tragic, that
most of those who leave this
school as graduates, rarely
speak out about anything what-
ever.....

Maybe not this time.

Dear Editor:

I am ‘deeply concerned with
the health of the Davidson
student body.

Observing the sudden seige of
post-nasal drainage and throat
congestion at Sunday’s vespers,
one would conclude either that
we're_a very sick group, or that
there are certain students here
who are quite open with their
feelings about the length of
time a speaker should use.

I was, of course, delighted to
find that there are those among
us who know how to tell time.
Yet I was equally as disappoint-
ed at their very crude manner
of displaying this ability.

Although I seriously doubt
that ten extra minutes of ves-
pers would tend to make any of
us “over-religioned,” I’m sure
thy there is a more tactful way
of controlling the length of ves-
pers.

Having been a Davidson
“Gentleman?” only four weeks,
I am quite wary of expressing
my candid opinions in THE

DAVIDSONIAN. for fear of.
starting a schoolwide contro-
versy over vesper speakers, or
something.

Therefore, since I cannot com-
fortably assert the above views,
TI will at least say that I think
the Smith Brothers could’ve
made a killing here Sunday
night. Perhaps we can schedule
them for next year. . ?

Dear Editor:

1 would tike to express my
personal opinion—a little bit
late, 1 know—regarding the
editorial “Wandering in the
Wilderness” and especially the
following paragraph:

Foreign students naturally
want to become acquainted
with all aspects of Ameri-
can life, not just Chambers
and their dormitories. They
cannot be of service to us
unless they have ample
time to participate in our
activities, lead our discus-
sions or just sit down over
a cup of coffee.

No doubt that we do want to
get acquainted with American
life—after all that is one pro-
vision of the Richardson Schol-
arship Program—but it is quite
impossible for us to know all
aspects of American life in one
year's time.

Furthermore, “Chambers and
dormitories” are a piece of
American life, aren't they? Isn‘t
the college life interesting?

On the other hand, I dare say
that the phrase “ ... they can-
not be of service to us: ...”
sounds quite chauvinistic, to
such an extent that one is liable
to draw the conclusion that
there is absolutely no concern
for us and our future.

Before I came here I was a-
ware of what I was expected to
do. I do want to get acquainted
with American life—not merely
to be of service to you cut io be
of service to me and my coun-
try, too—but I don't want to get
behind in my courses.

1 haven‘t come here for the
sheer fun of ‘it. | interrupted my
studies for something better. !
came with the double purpose to
study and at the same time get
acquainted with this country, its
people and their way of think-
ing and living.

I expect this year to be profit-
able to me in many ways.

It is quite true that I—any of
us, I think—meet with lots of
difficulties so that I am ab-
solutely doubtful about the
final results. But at least I will
try to realize the expectations
based on me.

How can I get acquainted with
your educational system if I am
not a student?

Student Doubts Chances
For German Reunification

Editor’s Note: The following is the first of a series of
student political commentaries in cooperation with the
International Relations Club.

Kirby studied last year at the Free University of Berlin.

BY LEE KIRBY

The present Berlin situation has forced the West
to evaluate once again the whole German problem, in-
cluding the cries for reunification heard from both the
German Federal Republic and the German Democratic
Republic. ; ;

Most Germans in both these countries give at least
token expression to the belief that a permanent solution
to Berlin’s division can be found only in a peaceful and
permanent union of the two German nations. We are
forced to ask ourselves if such a union is now possible
in peace.

There can be no union if the German people and
the two German governments do not want union. There
can be no peaceful union if Germany’s World War II
enemies are opposed to it.

The first obstacle to reunification is the almost
neurotic fear of Germany which the peoples of Western
Europe as well as the eastern Europeans harbor. It was
this fear which divided Germany in 1945. The English,
French, Dutch, Scandinavians, and Slavs have forgotten
two world wars. We must assume that the grassroots
povulation of these countries will not favor German re-
unification for a long time.

We can say that most Germans want reunification.
It is only natural. Many refugees would welcome the
opportunity to return to their place of birth, families
could be reunited, Germany could once again be a proud
nation undivided. There are, however, undercurrents of
dissension.

Almost all of German Catholicism lies in West Ger-
many where Catholics number about 43 of the popula-
tion and control the Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
the political party which has been in power since the
foundation of the Federal Republic.

East Germany is almost entirely made up of Pro-
testants and Communists. If the two nations were united,
Protestants would outnumber Catholics almost two to one.

Feeling runs between Catholic and Protestant about
like that. between Southerner and Yankee here. Catholic
Adenauer has been known to refer to Protestant Berlin
as the “City of Heathens;” His near-slanderous reference
to Socialist Willi Brandt’s birth outside Christian wedlock
is now famous.

The rightest-Catholic CDU has, therefore, a vested
interest in the division of Germany, since unification with
the Protestant and traditionally “left section of Ger-
many would mean the loss of its present power.

The West Germans are proud of their startling
economic recovery since the war. Many of them resent
the prospects of another period of hardship to put East
Germany on its feet after the proposed reunification.

Bearing one of the world’s heaviest tax loads, the
West German is tempted to gripe about such a large part
of his.taxes going to aid.refugees from the East, many of
whom are suspected of seeking only a soft life in western
prosperity.

On the other hand, many Eas? Germans dislike being
referred to as “our poor brothers across the borders.”
They are proud of their own more limited recovery and,
in part, idealistic about the prospects of building a
Socialist state in the homeland of Marx and Engels.

They point to the number of former Nazi industrial-
ists, Judges, and government officials still in power in
West Germany. Many fear that reunification will en-
danger the success of their Socialist experiment.

There is, then, severe opposition to German unity in
Europe and even within Germany itself.

This article will be continued next week.

1958-59 STUDENT COUNCIL

Trask Cites Statement
About Court Function

BY GEORGE TRASK
Student Body President

I am quoting below a state-
ment by the 1958-59 Student
Council which I believe best
states the function of the Honor
Court in its relation to the
Honor System and the Student
Body Regulations. When this
statement was made the func-
tions of our present Honor
Court were carried cut by the
Student Council.

However it was this 1958-59
Student Council which conceiv-
ed the Honor Court. and spon-
sored its acceptance by the stud-
ent body.

I therefore feel that this state-
ment expresses the original in-
tentions of the Honor Court, and
I further feel that these inten-
tions have not changed during
the ensuing years,

The statement reads as fol-
lows:

“We, the Student Council of
1958-59, make the following
affirmation: having taken as our
oath of office a pledge to up-
hold the honor system and the
student body regulations, we do
now re-express our intention to
do so.

“Further, we believe firmly
in the spirit of these laws and,
though not at the expense of
neglecting a continual and cri-
tical examination of them, do

plan to maintain this spirit.

“We feel that the letter of
the law is robbed of its meaning
without the spirit. Specifically,
we shall endeavor to abide by
the innermost convictions of
conscience and to cease the ra-
tionalization, justification, and
gentle winking that often char-
acterize us as a body insofar as
is humanly possible.

“We are able to make this
Statement only for ourselves;
however, just as the letter of
the law is dead without the
spirit of the law, so we feel is
the conviction of the Student
Council empty without the ac-
companying and coexistant con-
viction of the Sfudent Body.

“Therefore, we make appeal
to you that you seek to grasp
the spirit of these regulations
to which we have subjected our-
selves and join with us in striv-
ing for a positive rather than a
negative interpretation of them.

“If you do not feel so inclined,
we very strongly urge that you
petition for the liberalization of
any of these laws by which our
conduct is now guided.

“We shall interpret a failure
to petition as a positive vote of
confidence for the stand which
the council has taken and as ex-
pression of a desire to enforce
the present regulations.” *

; There has been no petition.
