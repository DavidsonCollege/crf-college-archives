The Davidson library contains
115,000 volumes and is increas-
ing at a rate of approximately
10,000 volumes a year. accord-
ing to Dr. Chalmers G. David-
son, director of the library.

It was, however, only in 1959
that the total number of books
added per year reached 5,000:
since that time the rate has dou-
bled. Part of this increase has
been due to a grant from the
Duke Endowment.

Dr. Davidson stated that Pres-
ident D. Grier Martin was able
to secure this grant for the col-
lege library two years ago. The
grant, amounting to $40,000 a
year, doubles the purchasing
budget of the library.

Now in the third year of the
grant, Davidson said that next
year the college should be able
to increase the number of vol-
umes above 10.000 per year
mark, since in the past much of
this money has gone into buying
much needed expensive re-
search sets.

, BOOK CAPACITY

The actual capacity of the li-
brary in storage of books is ap-
proximately 100,000 volumes
above the present 115,000; how-
ever, actual operating volume
can include only about 55,000
more books. If this figure were
ever reached, there would have
to be a new library building.
Davidson commented.

The most remarkable im-
provement in the library has
been the increase in budget,
according to Davidson. When
Martin was installed in 1958, the

colleges in the nation, north or
south.” An increase of this size
in the next five years would
place the annual budget at
around $500,000.

The library also subscribes to
approximately 800 periodicals,
including gift subscriptions, but
this total does not include an-
nuals which are considered ser-
ials and government documents.

IMPROVEMENTS

Although a new library is
planned, improvements have
been made during the past year
to the present structure. Most
notable was the shifting of books
in the library in order to make
the top story in the. Babcock
Wing available for use.

All of the books (all 115,000
volumes) had to be moved so
that new books could be moved
in and the order of the books
kept correct. Space for new
books has been opened in all
parts of the library by the re-
arrangement.

RELIGHTED ROOM

Also over the summer the re-
serve room was relighted, two
new audio visual machines were
added to the micro-film room,
and three new offices have been
opened on the first floor of
the Babcock Wing.

Davidson concluded that the
administration does not want to
spend too much more in the
building. since the new library
is being planned.

A comparison of Davidson Col-
lege library facilities with those
of other schools reveals many
shortcomings as well as some
strong points, according to last
fall's Self-Study Report and va-
rious Davidson professors.

In a comparison of librariés
with 28 other liberal arts col-
leges that compare to David-
son in size and scholastics, the
Self-Study Report ranks Dav-
idson last in number of books
and near the bottom in other
categories, despite its endow-
ment which ranks in the top
half of the other colleges.

For example, Kenyon. College
with only 630 students and less
than half of Davidson’s endow-
ment, has a 165,000 volume i-
brary, compared with David-
son’s estimated 121,000.

BELOW AVERAGE

The report also show. Dav-
idson far below the average
of these schools in nw ber of
periodicals, library expendi-
tures per student, and per cent
of college budget allotted for
the library.

Suggestions in the report in-
clude increased expenditures for
books and journals (specifical-
ly asking for 25,000 books and
125 journals more each eight
years), starting plans for a new
ifbrary, a larger staff, and
more and better lighted seat-
ing and cartel facilities.

Several strengths were noted
in the library. For example, the
open stock system makes find-
ing books easier and more leis-
urely.

EXCHANGE SYSTEM

The library maintains an ef-
ficient exchange system with
other colleges. The college is
also buying many new books;
1,500 were bought last month
acaording to Miss Della Shore,
library cataloguer.

able from the library staff.

Dr. Frank Bliss, associate pro-
fessor of English, commented.
“The library does a fine job
with the facilities it has. We
simply need more facilities.”’

WANT MORE WORK

Bliss also noted a change in
the attitude of students toward
their studies, “More students
are more serious about educa-
tion than in the past, wanting
to do more work. They must
have access to a greater num-

ber of books and periodicals.”
he said.

“We have the responsibility of
having books on hand both for
bibliographical purposes and the
‘browsing’ needed in the pur-
suit, of learning.”

The needs for library expan-
sion will become more evident
with the expansion of the hon-
ors program and the new cur-
riculum, Bliss continued.

between that library and the
Davidson one: “Of course
Princeton is better. but we're
coming. We're moving in the
right direction, beginning with
its student and graduate library,
in fact, to move rapidly,”

Some of the possibilities he
listed for the new library in-
clude an improved microfilm
room, greater record possibili-
ties, microcards, paintings and
‘a poetry and other special in-
terests rooms.

“The new library should be
exciting.”’ he concluded.

By MASON STEPHENSON
Davidsonian Staff Writer

An expanded staff and a book
capacity of about 600.000 vol-
umes are included :in the plans
for Davidson's new library
which tentatively will be built
within the next eight years.

Dr. Chalmers G. Davidson, di-
rector of the library, said that
although a site for the new
building which was recommend.
ed in last fall's Self-Study Re
port has not yet been selected,
he has already planned the
architecture. for the library.

Davidson hopes that the front
of the building will be a ro
tunda, modeled. after the Jef-
ferson-designed Hotunda at. the
University of Virginia. This
part of the structure will be in
the neo-classical architecture
typical of the rest of the Dav-
idson campus.

BLOCK STRUCTURE

Behind fhe rotunda. his plans
call for a. “University of New
Mexico rear” consisting of noth
ing but a block structure with.
out windows. This building will
be “‘artifically Hghted, heat-
ed, cooled. and cleaned,” ac-
cording to Davidson, and will
have a capacity projected at
approximately 600,000 volumes.

The inside will be as dras-
tic a break with tradition as the
“New Mexico rear.’’ Tentative-
ly planned are faculty study
earrels, departmental seminar
rooms, a doubling of the library
staff including the addition of
a rare book curator, and an
archivist and an increase in
the reference staff.

CULTURAL EXHIBITS

The rotunda: front. will serve
as an exhibit room featuring
cultural exhibits of art and writ-
ing which would be of interest
to the entire college community.

Commenting on the chances
for the building of this new li-
brary within the very near fu-
ture, Dr. Davidson stated, ‘‘Con-
sidering the president we now
have, it is almost definite.”

The types of carrels in the
new library will range from the
closed type for faculty and typ-
ing to the open type which is
currently in use in the Nbrary.
Davidson said that seating for
one-third of the student body
is generally considered adequate.

added that although this pro-

great deal of crowding since
space is not utilized as effec-
tively as possible.

As undergraduate libraries go,
Dr. Davidson said that the seat-
ing at the library is well ahead
of most, for Davidson provides
far above the average number
of carrels for individual study.

PRESENT NEEDS

In listing the present needs

of. the library, Dr. Davidson
said that solution to most of
the library’s problems will be
included in the construction of
the new library. He added that
the seminar rooms in the base-
ment are too small and too
crowded, but improved seminar
facilities are planned for in the
new structure.

Further, he commented that
the «micro film and audio-visual
department néeds expansion
since it has been outgrown, Two
new audio visual machines have
been added, but this crowds the
present available space.

But the library's greatest. need
is to increase the number of
volumes in the library. Tach
department in the school is
given a budget with which to
purchase needed books and the
library also has a general fund
from which to purchase books.
