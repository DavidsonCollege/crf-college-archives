TO MEET WG&L

Unbeaten Matmen
Faee Stern Tests

What do you do if you're the
Davidson College wrestling team
and you've had miniscule bud-
wrestling scholarships
and a strcug schedule?

You go on out and start the
season undefeated, which is just
what coach Charlie Parker and
his charges have done this sea-
son.

Starting out this year’s slate
with three relatively easy op-
ponents, the mat-cats have roll-
ed up wins over St. Andrews
College, Catawba College and
UNC-C.

However, Parker is mo opti-
mist. With such wrestling titans
as VMI, The Citadel, N. C.
State and Chapel Hill on the
schedule, he knows that the
‘eam is in for some rough go-
ing.

Parker predicts about the
same finish this year for the
Wildcats as last vear, 6-2.

He expects to finish no higher
than fourth in the Southern
Conference, behind talent-laden
William and Mary, East Caro-
lina and VMI.

Parker sees

gel, no

a dogfight for

fourth place between Davidson
and The Citadel, which David-
son meets on February 4-5.

Despite the dearth of scholar-
ships, Parker’s matmen are re-
markably cosmopolitan. Only
two wrestlers are from North
Carolina—Ronnie Williams from
Fayetteville and Frank Shinn
from South Iredell.

Of the rest, four are from Vir-
ginia, with others from Tennes-
see, Maryland, Pennsylvania
and Washington, D. C.

This is a young group, the
only senior being presently un-
defeated captain Ron Williams.

Other starters are undefeated
freshmen Rob Benton and Rob
Jacobs, whose older brother
Jack was last year’s captain,
and sophomore John Scandling.

Parker's pessimism notwith-
standing, the 'Cats appear solid
in all weight classes, having to
forfeit only at 118 Ibs.

The team’s next match is on
Wed., Jan 21 against Washing-
ton and Lee at Lexington, Vir-
ginia.

The next home match will be
a tournament featuring VMI,
Furman and The Citadel on
February 4-5.

Three Thinclads Represent
‘Cats In Richmond Tourney

Three Davidson track stand-
outs have been invited to par-
ticipate in the Chesterfield Jay-
cees Invitational Meet today in
Richmond.

Tommy Richardson, Ray
Swetenburg and Mark Coonors
will represent the Wildcat thin-
clads at the Richmond Colise-
um.

The meet was described as

Nators

this gives them a decided ad-
vantage over Davidson.

Hobbs himself was a key fac-
tor in the ‘Cats win over De-
Kalb.

He earned two first place
finishes and swam on the med-
ley relay team which took
first.

Freshman Rusty Saylor also
took a first place, in the breast-
stroke event, while divers Eric
Vernon and John Knox added
to Davidson's thirty-point -mar-
gin by taking first and second
places, respectively.

“Everybody is finally getting
in good shape, and the times
aie coming down a lot,” said
Coach Tom Steve.

Hobbs is within one second of
the school record for the 200-

yard individual medley and
within three seconds of the
school mark for the 200-yard
backstroke.

“IT think I can break both of
these records before the = sea-

sen’s over,” said Hobbs, ‘I’m
geiting in pretty good shape
now.”

Saylor is also threatening a
college mark. His best time for
the 200-yard breaststroke is on-
ly four seconds away from the
school record.

The poolmen will have to be
at their best for the next five
days in order to maintain a
winning percentage.

The swimmers’ previous vic-
tory was over UNC at Ashe-
ville. Their only loss came in
the opening meet of the season,
when they dropped a decision
to Morris Harvey.

Stevens attributed this loss to
the lack of training over the
Christmas’ break, explaining
that the team had only four
days to practice for the meet.

“a real big event” in the track
competition, and coach Heath
Whittle was understandably
pleased by the invitations.

“We are yery happy that they
have been chosen", Whittle
stated. ‘‘This is the first time
we have had participants in this
event in five or six years.”

The thinclads will participate
in two other meets as part of
their winter track season, the
VMI relays on Feb. 5 and the
Southern Conference Champion-
ships on Feb. 19.

Both events will be held at
Lexington, Va.

Richardson will run in the
60-yard dash at Richmond. He
won that event last year in the

Southern Conference Indoor
Track Championships.
Swetenburg will participate in
the 60 yard high hurdles and
the triple jump. He placed third
in the SC indoor track tourney
and won the hurdles last: year.
Connors is a freshman from
Sulfern, N. Y. He will) partici-
pate in the 600-yard tun,
Connors ran a 48.7 in the 440
in high school, a time that ap-
proaches the Davidson record.
The team as a whole has im-
proved over last year, partic
ularly in the distance events.
Several freshmen, notably dis-
tance man Rick Bell, have add-
ed a great amount of depth to
the Wildcat squad.
