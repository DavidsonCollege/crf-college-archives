By BOB REID
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Lefty Driesell’s up-and-
coming Wildcats tangle with
five tough cage outfits dur-
ing the coming Christmas
holidays, highlighted by the
third annual Charlotte Invi-
tational Tourname=t.

The ‘Cats open their holi-
day slate on campus Satur-
day against Dartmouth, then
meet Ohio University, Navy.
William and Mary and either
Princeton or Mississippi State
in the 11,666-seat Charlotte Coli-
seum.

After the holidays. Driesell
takes his team to Richmond
for a conference tilt with the
Spiders on Jan, 4.

The opening game of the Char-
lotte tournament Dec. 28 pits
Mississippi State against. Prince-
ton, while host team Davidson
faces Navy in the nightcap.

The following evening the win-
ners of the Tuesday games meet
‘for the championship after the
consolation match at 7:30. ;

Princeton, second runner-up
for the NCAA National cham-
pionships last year, boasts four
starters from that squad. The

IFC Gives
Procedure
For Bids

The fraternities have
made their decisions about
the freshmen. As the 1965-
66 rushing period ends, the
freshmen must, in the next
two weeks, make their de-
cisions about the fraterni-
ties.

The IFC will mail bids to
freshmen on Saturday. Bids
must be returned to the IFC
representative of the selected
fraternity before the close of
the Christmas holidays.

Johnny Jeter, TFC Rush Com-
mittee chairman aid that in
order to avoid confusion, fresh-
men should make their decisions
as soon as possible and return
the bid that they choose.

Due to the possible confusion
in the holiday mail rush, Jeter
advised, “If any freshman has
received no communication at
all from the IFC by Christ-
mas, he should call me collect
at (803) 427-2665 in Union, S. C.”

He said that no trouble is an-
ticipated, but freshmen should
keep the above number just in
case. He also pointed out that
everyone who is still out for
rush will receive a letter from
the IFC, whether they receive
a bid or not.

Both freshmen and fraternity

men should note also that the}.

final period of silence begins at
the end of classes, at 12:10 on
Saturday afternoon and lasts
until 8 a.m., Jan. 3, 1966. During
this period, the only contact al-
lowed between fraternity men
and freshmen is a_ salutatory
greeting.

Navy.

The Naval Academy will bring
a seasoned team, led by 6-3
guard Bill Radcliffe. who holds
the Academy scoring record for
a single game with 41 points.
Assisting Radeliffe will be for-
wards Jim Snook and Chris
Reddingfon. Reddington. a 6-4
senior, has averaged 25 points
for the season.

Mississippi State is the big
question mark in the tourney.
According to Driesell, ‘We
haven't been able to scout Mis-
sissippi State yet. Frankly, we
don’t know a thing about them.

DARTMOUTH

This weekend the ‘Cats play
host to Dartmouth in the first
cage encounter between the two
schools. The Indians posted a
disappointing 4-21 record last
year but are a much stronger
team thjs season.

According to Assistant Coach
Warren Mitchell, ‘‘Inexperience
hurt Dartmouth last year, Just
about all their boys were sopho-
mores, but now, with a year’s
experience under their belts,
they should be developing into
a real fine ball club.”

‘The Dartmouth roster includes
seven returning lettermen, led
by forwards Pete Dunlop and
Gunner Malm, plus guard Steve
Schaffer. The lineup includes
sophomore guard Joe Coigan,
who stands only 5-9 in height.

OH10

On Dec. 21 Davidson faces the
Bobcats of Ohio University, co-
champions of the Mid-American
Conference, in the Charlotte
Coliseum.

Anchoring the Bobéat quintet
will be center John Schroeder,
a 6-9 junior from Norwalk, Ohio.
Schroeder has been averaging
16 points a game. while haul-
ing down rebounds to the tune
of 14 per night.

Topping Ohio's scoring charts
is forward Ken Folkes, a 6-4
junior from Columbus, Ohio.
Fowlkes has been averaging 16.3
points per game, while averag-
ing 10 rebounds every tilt. How-
ever, injuries sustained in a re-
cent auto accident have. cur-
tailed Fowlkes’ play. The junior
ior forward has been benched
for the last two games, but is
listed as a probable starter for
the Davidson tilt.

Alternating at the other for-
ward spot will be 6-3 junior
Russ Hamilton and 6-5 junior
Phil Williams. Starting at guard
will be 5-10 Mike Hammond and
6-0 Dave Brown. Hammond and
Brown have been averaging sev-
en and eight points per game.
respectively.

WM. & MARY

Mitchell expects a tough game
with William and Mary on New
Years Day. in the Coliseum. Ac-
cording to Mitchell ‘William
and Mary has a. real good club.
All their starters from last year
are back, and they have a real
good crop of sophomores to pro-
vide depth.”

Guard Walter Wenk returns
with a 14.3 scoring average. and
a reputation as a fine defensive
player. Seniors Larry Paffath
and Tim Walter will man the
front court positions, with 6-6
center Ben Pomeroy and 6-2

The change came out of a Fri-

Faculty Conference Committee.

At the Council meeting. John
Burks, Honor Court member

who has been active in trying to .

bring about a revision of the
Student Body Regulations, re-
ported, ‘‘I was very pleasantly
surprised at the reaction of the
faculty members toward the
idea. The new insertion will not
compromise our position at all."
“There was a sort of ‘wait-

the faculty and administration
members,’ said Chuck Matt-
hews.
_ Burks reported that in a Fri-
day morning meeting with Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin; Frontis

president; and Council members
Billy Clark and Dave Powell.

Jobs, Scholarships

Applications are now available for the 1966
newspaper internship program of The News-
paper Fund, which awards a $500 scholarship
to selected applicants upon completion of three
months of full-time newspaper work.

Last summer two Davidson students par-
ticipated in the program, which is supported by
grants from The Wall Street Journal. They are
John Todd and Walt Drake. Todd worked for
The News and Courier in Charleston, S. C., and
Drake worked for The Atlanta Constitution.

Position are available during the summer
months on a number of newspapers which co-
operate in The Newspaper Fund program.

The Fund is particularly interested in re-
ceiving applications from juniors in colleges
where students have no opportunities for formal
courses in journalism; this, however, does not
preclude members of other classes who are in-
terested in any kind of newspaper work.

Students who have worked professionally
as beginning reporters, photographers or copy
editors, part-time or full-time, are not eligible

for the program.

A winner must work a minimum of 10
weeks for the newspaper that employs him. In

addition to the salary earned as a newspaper
reporter, the journalist is awarded the $500
grant by The Wall Street Journal at the end of

the summer.

Interested students should contact John
Todd, editor-in-chief of THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Application deadline is Jan. 10, 1966.

BILL COUNCIL

Kuykendall
Proposals
Deferred

By JOHN BAILEY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

A. petition presented to Bill
Couneit, president of the Stu-
dent Council. concerning a re-
vamping of Honor Court policy
and procedure will not be voted
upon until second semester.

The petition, read. in chapel
Monday. calls for the Honor
Court to draw up ‘“‘a definite
procedure” and certain
changes in the organization of
the Court as regards defense
counseling and prosecutions.

It also proposes that the word
“ordinarily” be inserted in the
Honor Code, Article VII, Sec-
tion 5. so that this article would
read: ‘Every student found guil-
ty of violating any section of
this Article shall ordinarily be
dismissed from the college."

The last proposal in the peti-
tion calls for the addition of a
sixth section to Article VII which
would compel the Honer Court
to observe ‘'compassion and un-
derstanding" in dealing with de-
fendants.

George Kuykendall, organizer
of the petition, agreed to post-
pone. the vote upon the petition
until the second semester in or-
der that freshmen would be
able to vote upon the proposal,
especially since a number of
freshmen signed the petition.

NUMBER THIRTEEN

‘Plans New Referendum

Voting Irregularities,
Misinformation Cited

The Student Council decided yesterday not to count
the ballots on the Student Body Regulations referendum

held in Chapel Tuesday.

At a meeting held yesterday
for the purpose of tabulating
the vote of the student body
for revamping the reguations.
the Council discussed many as-
pects of the manner in which
the referendum. was held.

They determined that it would
be better to back up and go
through the entire procedure aft-
er the Christmas holidays in an
effort to abide more strictly
with constitutional provisions for
amendment of the Student Body
Regulations.

The referendum evolved from
a proposal made by John Burks.
senior member of the Honor
Court, that the student body vote
on what sections it would be
willing to enforce. The present
regulations make students ‘‘duty
bound” to report infractions of
Student. Body Regulations.

Bill Council, president of ‘the
student body, expressed regret
that matters had been hurried
to such an extent that the stu-
dent body as a whole was not
fully aware of just what was
involved in the vote.

He was quick to emphasize
that “the ballots were not .tal-
lied” before the decision of: the
Council to hold a new refendum
was made.

Council ‘stated that there was
“no precedent for doing it this
way."’ He was referring to the
fact that the proposal! for a ref-
erendum along with a com-
plete reading of the issue to be
voted upon and a discussion with
the student body of the situa-
tions. {involved was not present-
ed at least five days prior to
the voting as required in Article
XI, Section 2. of the Student
Body Constitution.

Council feels, and the Coun-
cil concurs. that ‘there is ‘‘no
sense in not making sure that
we do it exactly right.”

The decision to hold a new
vote was made on the basis of
the Council's feeling that some
students had turned in more
than one ballot. and also from
the belief that everyone was not
fully aware of the fact that the
vote was not a ‘‘straw vote”
but rather a genuine referendum
which would invoke lasting

UNION PARTY

Fabulous Five To Play

The annual Union Christmas
party, featuring the Karl Boxer
Trio and the Fabulous Five, will
be held tomorrow ri-** from
7:30 until 2:30.

Faculty Drinking Action
Gets Varied Response

The latest result of the
faculty’s action on the
drinking issue has been gen-
erally accepted as a more
realistic settlement than the
more restrictive earlier
rules.

Hansford Epes, German in-
structor, expressed satisfaction
in “taking the fraternity after-
parties out of a gray area in
which drinking was not known
to be legal or not.”

Dr. J. G. Martin, a member
of the joint Faculty-Trustee
Committee on Alcoholic Bever-
ages, which initiated the change,
explained the history of the Dav-
idson afterparty.

“In the early 1950°s the fra-
ternities thought of having birth-
day parties to evade the rule
outlawing drinking at events of
the college organizations. Then
the afterparty came into being
in the late ‘50s.”

“This rule is more realistic,”

Martin contained, “because it
will eliminate most of the irra-
tional regulations. It doesn't
seem likely that athletes and
band members will be begging
to get drunk on college trips.”

The chang was influenced by
complaints issued by Heath
Whittle, assistant director of ath-
letics, and Dan Campbell, chair-
man of the Social Council.

Whittle argued that although
there would be no problem in
controlling the discipline prob-
lem this year, it would be best
to guard against unforeseen ele-
ments in the future. Campbell
feared that the social council
would be pressured into having
all social functions off campus.

Ernest Patterson, economics
professor, argued that the rule
as it now stands is much less
satisfactory from standpoint of
facing reality of situation that
the October ruling. As it stands
now, if the facts were known,

a real problem could exist on
campus without anyone realizing
it.”

Athletic Director Tom Scott
felt that the change was a bene-
ficial one. “We wanted some
protection for the coaches,’’ Dr.
Scott said.

“There would be no problem
for football and basketball,” he
continued, “because they travel
in buses or planes, but minor
sports often use private cars.
Though we didn't anticipate any
problems, it would have develop-
ed.”

Dr. J. W. Reid Jr., professor
of geography. expressed sur-

prise over the change in fac-

ulty sentiment. “There was a
close vote on the first change.
but the second was almost over-
whelming.”

Reid said he had opposed the
first, change and voted in favor
of the second, which ‘‘didn’t
change the rules appreciably,”
he said.

The trio, a jazz group, will
play in the main dining room,
Boxer, who records on the Dot

label, has appeared at several

other schools in this area, and
has been very well received.

Along with his group, Boxer
will bring a comedian currently
playing in a Charlotte night club
to entertain during intermis-
sions.

For those who wish to dance,
the Fabulous Five will be fea-
tured in the Morrison Room
from 8 until 12. A student talent
show will be held during a break
in their performance, and door
prizes will be given away. Fol-
lowing the Five, the Aces Wild
will play until 2:30.

In the private dining room
next to the Morrison Room,
there will be performances
throughout the evening by Bill
Spooner, a magician and card
sharp. He will present at least
four shows, with the first be-
ginning between 8 and 8:30.

HOLIDAY ISSUE

With this special four-page
issue, THE DAVIDSONIAN
suspends publication until aft-
er the Christmas holidays. The
next Issue will be on Friday,
Jan. 7, 1966.

Only one DAVIOSONIAN
will be published in January,
with publication again ceasing
for first semester exemina-
tions.

‘changes in the Student Body
Regulations. ;

As the situation now stands.
Council. will read the proposed
referendum ballot before the
entire student body the Tuesday
after the Christmas recess.

The formal procedure of indi-
vidual _ balloting, involving
checking off each  student’s
name as he votes and the use
of ballot boxes, will be follow-
ed, The vote will probably be
held the Monday. and Tuesday
of the week after the referen-
dum js-read.

The referendum will still in-
volve a vote on each of the eight
sections of the Student Body
Regulations. Bach student will
cast his vote to retain or repeal
-the --sections—indlvidually. As
the Constitution states in Artiele
XI, Section’ 2: “ . A two-
thirds vote of those present’ and
entitled to vote shall be neces-
sary for an amendment to be
adopted."* Freshmen will still be
ineligible to vote.

Council believes that holding
a new referendum ‘won't affect °
the vote.” He assumed the re-
sponsibility for the problem and
the necessity of holding a see-
ond balloting.

Journalist Howe
To Speak Jan. 4

Russell Howe, African affairs
correspondent for the Washing-
ton Post, will speak in assem-
bly Jan, 4.

and white caricatures. These will

pionship Tournament.
