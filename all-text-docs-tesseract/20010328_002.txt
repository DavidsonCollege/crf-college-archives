out véry first meeting on Tuesday, April
10th at 8:30pm in the Heeesices of the

SGA and Honor
Council elections
show faults in
internet voting

MIKE ANDERSON
Editor Emeritus

It was brought to the attention of the Senate
Executive Committee on Monday that there
was widespread student confusion about the
Category III Online Ballots.

SGA President Joey Harris called an
emergency meeting of the SEC at 4:30 PM on
Monday—attended by the full SEC as well as
Elections Council co-chair Ian Willoughby—
to evaluate options for rectifying the election.

The body voted unanimously (7-0) to
take the following steps:

- Discount all ballots cast through the web
server on Monday

- Schedule a new election on Wednesday,
March 28

- Hold runoffs, as necessary, ASAP fol-
lowing the general election—most likely on
Thursday, March 29

- Insert an additional explanatory page
into Wednesday’s ballot page, reiterating that
students are to vote only for elections of their
own class and affirming an Honor Code re-
sponsibility to vote fairly and honestly
- Send out campus-wide voice-mails and
e-mails explaining the scenario
Confusion arose due to limitations from
ITS web servers. The office had no program
to facilitate multiple election pages—instead,
all ballots were placed on the same page with
no capability to restrict students from voting
in multiple races. Language explaining the
process proved insufficiently clear and many
students inadvertently voted in elections for
other classes.

Wednesday’s ballot will include clarified
voting procedures that will facilitate a fair
and accurate election. ;

“We were lucky to have caught this confu-
sion early,” said Harris. “When it came to our

attention, the SEC came together immedi-
ately to figure out how to handle the situation.

Because we caught it early, we were able to

sit down and make decisions before any re-
sults had been tabulated—that kept it from
getting political, we were able to make fair
and clear-headed decisions in the interests of
all concerned.

“The SEC really pulled together and
brainstormed some solid ideas about how to
deal with the situation at hand. It was atough
position to be in, but I think they handled it
perfectly.”

The SEC is proscribed by the SGA’s by-
laws and includes the SGA President (Joey
Harris), Vice-president (Beth Gardner), Chan-
cellor (Elder Gwen), Treasurer (Carla Bul-
lock), and four class presidents (Christopher
Brantley, Bobby Pittenger, Gray Patterson,
Charles Washington).

This was the second election in which the
SGA: had implemented online balloting.
Internet voting was inspired by a desire to
make balloting more accessible to students—
students could vote over the course of an
entire day from the privacy of their own
room, rather than stopping by a busy voting
booth in Chambers or the Commons. Ac-
cording to former Elections Council chair
Randy Skattum, voter turnout increased 67%
once Internet voting was implemented.

“The first election went a lot more smoothly
simply because everyone on campus was
voting in the same races,” Harris explained.
“But because different classes were voting in
different races this week, we ran into some
hiccups.”

“Any time you tread into new territory
there is potential for complications,” said
Harris. “But the SEC handled this with a
great deal of poise and we’ re back on track.”

Elections co-chair Ian Willoughby will
ensure that a new web program is in place by
Category I elections next fall that should
eliminate any future confusion. In the mean-
time, carefully-worded instructions and a re-
liance upon the community’s Honor Code
will facilitate a fair and even election process
over the course of this week.
