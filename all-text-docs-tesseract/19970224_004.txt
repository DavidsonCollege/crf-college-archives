Blachman aims to break America’ s drug habit

Morris Blachman, Assistant
Dean of Continuing Medical Edu-
cation at the University of South
Carolina, spoke on “America’s
Addictive Policy in The Drug War:
Breaking the Habit” on Thursday in
the 900 Room. He was hosted by
the Dean Rusk Program.

Blachman is the co-author of
Drug War Politics: Price of Denial.
In his book, he examines why
America’s war on drugs will never
work, why it persists as a failure,
and possible alternatives to its battle
tactics.

“The basic approach we have
had is going after [drug] supply.
The idea is to keep [drugs] from
getting into the country. If [drugs
do] get into the country, then we
take a punitive approach,” says
Blachman.

Problems occur in two areas,
according to Blachman. They are
what he terms the “profit paradox”
and the “hydro effect.” He says,

“The very process of making drugs’

[specifically marijuana, heroin, and
cocaine] legal also generates a profit.
We make it enticing for people to be
in the business. This is called the
‘profit paradox.”

Blachman outlined the life of
one kilo of cocaine to describe the’
“hydro effect.” The cocoa leaves
needed to make cocaine can be

1500. They are processed and sold
at a profit to someone who brings it
to the United States. Now the value
of the cocaine is at $20-30,000. By
the time it is sold in Detroit or
Davidson, it costs $250-300,000.

“If you think of this as a busi-
ness, understand it as a good, solid,
wide open capitalist enterprise,”
says Blachman. “Do you stop be-
cause the U.S. government is inter-
dicting some of it? Anybody can get
into this business and the amount of
money that you can get into one
briefcase is such that a lot of people
do it. So many people do it that
there is no way to control it.”

Blachman believes that drug
problems exist because the “profit
paradox” makes buying and selling
drugs too profitable and the “hydro
effect” makes too many people in-
volved. Yet, there is no solution in
more resources, better or more co-
ordination by officials, or more
emphasis on the war on drugs, ac-
cording to Blachman.

Moving in the direction where
funding is going to be available is
very good for agencies, he says.
There are currently 43 U. S. gov-
ernment agencies who are trying to
find their way into the drug war,” he
says. Blachman calls this problem
the Narco Enforcement Complex,
or NEC.

Without an overarching evalu-
ator, Blachman says, each agency is
responsible to its own mission. To

keceive funding, It must prove that _

the drug war is still there and that
the agency should still be involved
in the process.

No one in Congress would
stand up against this bureaucratic
process for fear of appearing “soft
on drugs.” With 74 different com-
mittees to deal with the drug war,
every Congressperson has his or
her claim in the war on drugs, how-
ever inefficient. The President can
always pick up the drug war as a
high-profile battle.

“Around 1900, you could turn
to your Sears Roebuck catalog and
order morphine. You could go to
your neighborhood store and buy
medicine with cocaine in it. Many
people used these drugs and had
normal jobs, families, etc. Then a
concern developed about addiction.
There was a belief that Chinese
brought opium, Africans cocaine,
Mexicans marijuana which all re-
sulted in the corruption of America.
The thought was ‘If those people
don’t provide it, then we won’t have
a problem. It’s a supply problem
and not a demand problem,’” says
Blachman.

Through ideas propagated by
organizations such as the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), drugs
and crime were interlinked. A movie
was created by the FBN called
“Reefer Madness” which said that
people who smoke marijuana go
crazy immediately.

“By the time we got to the 50s,
not only had we made drugs puni-

tive, but we began to raise prison
terms and make mandatory sentenc-
ing,” says Blachman. “Because we
have overcrowded jails, we release
people with armed robbery to make
room for someone caught with two
joints.”

In the United States alone, 12.5
million people admitted that they
have used heroin, marijuana, or
cocaine in the last month, 20-30
million used one or more in the last
year, and 2.5 million people are
fully addicted to one or more of
these drugs. Yet, when one goes to
a public facility for treatment, a
person is immediately stamped a
criminal. A pregnant woman can

have her child taken away and goto
jail for drug use while pregnant,
thus many women continue their
habit in private without seeking help
and produce addicted children.

“Reduce harm, reduce usage is
incompatible with the paradigm
we’re talking about now. This is
not a winnable strategy,” says
Blachman. He proposes a strategy
where needle exchanges are encour-
aged and reduced usage in levels is
encouraged as opposed to the zero-
tolerance drug policy now.

“This is a political struggle and
an issue of power,” says Blachman.
“It takes that struggle to remove the
paradigm.”
