FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1956

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

A Man's World?

The Davidson student’s recurring
complaint over the lack of coeduca-
tional classmates is not without cer-
tain advantages.

We take comfort in knowing that
we will not be faced with the predica-
ment confronting staff members of
the Harvard Crimson.

The recent appointment of Miss
Linda McVeigh, 18-year-old Radcliffe
junior, as managing editor of the
Crimson strikes fear into the hearts
of every male journalist who sees the
threat of female invasion into a pre-
viously all-male domain.

At least one colleague, John Roth-
child, managing editor of the Yale
Daily News, has become sufficiently
aroused to trv to regain what is left of
the male self-respect.

“| have become very upset at the
female assault on the male world. and
want to do something about it,”’ said

Rothchild in challenging Miss Mc--

Veigh to a game of jacks, which he
subsequently won. .

But Rothchild found his victory a
hollow one, commenting in a post-
match press conference: “Men, we are
lost. 1 won the jacks match, but my
truthful admission is that J lost the
war.”

Miss McVeigh’s reported rejoinder
showed a decided want of deference
for the male journalist’s superiority
at athletics: “He may have beat me at
jacks. but I saw him put together a
paper and I know I can do a better
job at that.” .

In the face of such presumption, we
count it a blessing that the present
host of female companionship on cam-
pus is only. temporary and that the
male sanctity on THE DAVIDSONIAN
remains intact. for the time being at
least.

The American Idea Of Justice

The Voting Rights Act of 1965, the
constitutionality of which has recently
been argued before the Supreme
Court, purports to aim at preventing
racial discrimination in voter registra-
tion. We endorse this aim.

Unfortunately, however, we find
little to applaud in the new law, which,
claims Attorney General Nicholas Kat-
zenbach, “operates fairly and reason-
ably” to achieve elimination of voting
discrimination.

The absurdity of the use of the
terms “fair” and “reasonable” in de-
scribing the Act should be obvious to
even Mr. Katzenbach himself. How
“fair” ig the paradoxical situation in
which a bill which has a purpose of
preventing discrimination and_at-
tempts to achieve this purpose with a
law in which enforcement results only
in those states in which less than 50
per cent of the voting age population
voted in the 1964 elections?

This excludes 15 northern states
with literacy tests, such as New York,
where only a small percentage of Har-
lem’s adult population has qualified
for and exercised the privilege of vot-
ing. The law is also enforced in those
states in which literacy tests exist, ex-
cuding LBJ’s Texas, where only 44 per
cent of the voting age population vot-
ed in 1964.

Are literacy tests considered un-
constitutional or necessarily discrim-
inatory? Obviously not. because the
law enables 15 states to maintain a
literate electorate.

Are states guilty of discrimination
if less than 50 per cent of their adults
vote in elections? If so, then how does
one explain states such as Texas,
where less than 50 per cent vote but
no discrimination exists, according to
the federal formula?

Only six states, all in the South and
all voting against LBJ in 1964. fall into
both categories and only in these six
states has the federal government
been impowered to abolish the right of
the people of these states to require a
literate electorate.

Thus an absurd situation arises in
which a moron could be granted by
federal authorities the right to vote in
Alabama, but if he moved to New
York, that state would deny him the
privilege of voting.

This irony, noted The Wall Street
Journal last year, “is not funny. Be-
neath the paradox lies a serious ques-
tion. Is it moral .that national laws
should apply one rule to one State and
another to.another, requiring that the
people of one State abolish qualifica-
tions for voters while the people of
another State may uphold their stand-
ards?”

The paradoxes of the bill reach the
absurd where the Act provides that
these six states are guilty of discrim-
ination unless they can prove them-

selves innocent. directly contradicting
the American idea of justice, by which
a person is innocent until proven guil-

ty.

y Further, the states involved have to
prove that no discrimination against
any individual has existed in the last
ten years. an impossibility even in
New York City, Chicago, or Johnson
City, Tex.

To argue against the law as uncon-
stitutional is somewhat meaningless,
although the unconstitutionality of the
Act is probably evident even to Mr.
Katzenbach. Although only a most
perverted view of the Constitution
could see the Voting Rights Act as
within its limitations, the question is
neither here nor there since for the
purposes of Mr. Katzenbach, Mr. War-
ren, and other eminent liberals, the
Constitution is dead.

The idea behind the law is express-
ed by Justice Hugo Black, who noted,
“It’s politically known to everybody in,
the country that these tests have been
used to deny people their right to
vote.” This no reasonable person de-
nies.

But the same logic behind this idea
—the idea that abuse of a principle
condemns the whole principle—could
be used to abolish police forces on .the
grounds the powers held by police-
men are sometimes abused.

The equal rights fight could be
pursued and the Fifteenth Amen4-
ment (preventing denial of suffrage
because of race) enforced with a law
requiring every citizen to renew his
registration and providing for federal
inspection to insure that every indi-
vidual is given equal opportunity to
register. regardless of race and sub-
ject to the same impartial literacy re-
quirement.

We have no doubt that the Su
preme Court will do what is political-
ly popular and assert that the ends
justify the means.

We lament, however, the influence
which civil rights groups have achiv-
ed with their bombastic statements
appealing to irrational emotion. We
also lament the passing of the idea
that popular government needs no
Constitutional limitations—which lim-
it a majority of the nation from being
just as discriminatory against a na-
tional minority as a white majority in
Alamaba is discriminatory against a
black minority.

We agree that federal action is
needed in a number of cases to rem-
edy racial discrimination in voting
registration, and we submit that the
proposal presented above would be an
effective remedy.

But if the Voting Rights Bill of
1965 is an example of Mr. Katzen-
bach’s idea of “fairness” and “rea-
son,” then we hope he never will sit
in judgment of us.

Former Soldier Calls Viet Nam War ‘A Lie’

A former American soldier
who was a member of the Spec-
ial Forces in Viet Nam, the first
enlisted man to be nominated for
the Legion of Merit, alleges our
men are dying for ‘a Jie’ in an
article in the February issue of
Raniparts magazine.

Master Sergeant Donald Dun-
can, who turned down a com-
mission and captaincy and left
the army last September after
10 years of service, tells in an
article, “The Whole Thing Was
A Lie.” of his evolution from
“militant anti-communist’’ to
the discovery that “it’s not
democracy we brought to Viet
Nam — it's anti-communism.”

“Tt has taken a long time and
a mountain of evidence but I
had finally found some truths,"
Dunean writes. “The world is
not just good guys and bad guys.
Anti-communism is a. lousy sub-
stitute for democracy.

“I know now that there are
many types of communism but
there are none that appeal to
me,"’ he asserts. ‘In the long

run, I don't think Viet Nam will
be better off under Ho’s brand
of communism. But it’s not for
me or my government to decide.
That decision is for the Viet-
namese.”

Some highlights of Duncan's
article include:

American Special Forces are
taught techniques of torture. “I
was later to witness first hand
the practice of turning prisoners
over to ARVN (Army of the Re-
public of Vietnam) for ‘inter-
rogation’ and the atrocities
which ensued," Duncan writes.

Special Operations Group,
composed of CIA, Air Force,
Navy. Army and Special Forces
personnel, is operating inside of
North Viet Nam. “The real
question was, whether commun-
ism is spreading in spite of our
involvement or because of it,”
he states,

Racial discrimination was
rampant in the Special Forces.
from the former Latvian who
was not interested in Viet Nam
(“I wouldn't. blend. There are

not many blue-eyed gooks’*), to
the captain who instructed Dun-
can: “Don't send me any nig-
gers. Be careful, however, not
to give the impression that we
are prejudiced in Special Forces
... " In the larger Viet Nam
town, ‘Negroes do not go into

white bars except at the risk .

of being ejected.”

Resentment of Americans by
South Vietnamese ‘‘runs all the
way from stiff politeness to ob-
vious hatred.”

Vietnamese soldiers were sent
into Loas on a secret mission.
without the Americans who had
trained them and trained with
them, because “‘it was an elec-
tion year and it would cause
great embarrassment if Ameri-
cans were captured in Laos.”
Says Duncan, ‘This was the one
thing, if I had to single one out.
that made me really start ques-
tioning our role in Viet Nam.”

This mission into Laos, from
which six out of 40 men return-
ed. confirmed ‘“‘that the Viet
Cong were getting the bulk of

POWERFUL ALLEGORY
Film Friends To Project
‘Woman In The Dunes’

By WILLIAM TROTTER

The highlight of this semes-
ter's Film Friends’ program,
Woman In the Dunes, will be
shown in the Morrison Room
Monday. This _ troublingly
beautiful film is the weird tale.
of a Japanese scientist who finds
himself lost in a remote marshy
coastal region.

He asks some fishermen for’
lodging for the night and is di-
rected to the home of a peas-
ant woman, a home which lies at
the foot of a vast pit walled off
from the world by sheer cliffs of
sand. In the morning, the rope
ladder by which he reached the
bottom of the pit has been pulled
up; he is trapped.

He and the woman must end-
lessly clear away the sand,
bucket by bucket: in return for
their labor, the villagers lower
food to them. It is soon appar-
ent that the man and the wom-
an are Everyman and Every-
woman. and the hell hole in
which. they are trapped is life
itself.

Allegory of this nature is un
fashionable. these days—one can
pretend to be profound. with

symbolism much more easily;
symbols, if obsscure enough, can
claim respect for the most mean-
ingless babble. That the film
is an allegory of terrific impact
is perhaps Its most outstanding
feature.

As Time magazine said ‘‘the
metaphor is grand, the allegory
clothes the powerful narrative
as patterns clothe a python
a luminous and violent existen-
tial thriller.”

Rarely, if ever, has a film.
portrayed so tangibly the very
texture of its meaning—the cam-
era. conveys the gritty terror of
the endless sands, the subtlest
tones and textures of skin, sand,
wind and driftwood.

The film is filled with sus-
pense and violent shifts of ac-
tion, and goes perhaps as far as
modern. cinema can presently go
in depicting the intimacies of
love and hate. Woman in the
Dunes is a daring. visually stun-
ning. and spiritually vibrant film
which will, most critics agree.

come to be regarded as a major:

classic of the art.

Coming later in the. semester
will be The Brig, by Jonas

‘See?.. . It's Only Paper... .

Mekas—a nerve-shatering essay
on brutality and sadism in a

their weapons from ARVN and
by sea. It was also one more
piece of evidence that the Viet
Cong were primarily South Viet-
namese, not, imported troops
from the North. One more thing
was added to my. growing lists
of doubts of the ‘official’ stories

“When teaching Special Forces

‘how to set up guerrilla warfare

in an enemy country, killing un-
popular officials is pointed out
as one method of gaining friends
among the populace. It jis re-
commended that special assas-
sination teams be set up for this
purpose. I know of a couple of
cases where it was suggested by
Special Forces officers that
Viet Cong prisoners be killed,”
Duncan asserts.

“Communist or not, the vast
majority of the people were pro-
Viet Cong and anti Saigon. I had
to accept also that the position.

are in sympathy with the aspira-

‘tions and desires of the Viet-

namese people, was a lie,” he

Marine Corps jail which has .

been hailed as one of the most
powerful films of the decade.

It is hoped that it will be
possible to have Mr. Mekas him-
self on campus this semester,
to deliver a series of discussions
and lectures on modern film.

It is also hoped that it will
be possible to show a film by the
man many regard as the great-
est living French. writer, after
Sartre, Jean Genet. The classic
Cabinet Of Dr. Callgari, a study
of horror and madness and one
of the most legendary films of
all time, will be shown in April.

Dog Star Man, a film which
has been called ‘‘one of the
greatest works of American
art,” will be featured in March.

Each feature-length film will
be accompanied by short sub-
jects. ranging from “La Chein
Andalou”’—a_ surrealist fantasy
by Salvador Dali—to ‘World in
‘Remembrance,”’ a poetic ac-
count of the funeral rites of
Winston Churchill.

Film Friends’ program for this
semester, will be the most va-
ried and interesting yet.

‘UNRESTICTED CONTACT’ CLAUSE

Marion Shows Weakness
Of CommitteeSuggestions

Dear Editor:

The Social Life Evaluation
Committee suggested in its re-
cent report that contact between
freshmen and upperclassmen be
unrestricted from Monday
through Priday, except after 7:30
pm. Although the I. F. C.
would be free to regulate week-
end contact, the Committee's
proposal leaves open the possi-
bility of many expensive and
time consuming rush activities.

For example, freshmen could
be invited to eat meals ‘and
spend the afternoons at the fra-
ternity houses. Freshmen could
be invited to off-campus frater-

nity social functions any week-
day or night, including Friday.
Fraternity men could invite
freshmen to double date or go on
road trips.

Although few fraternities
would want to participate in
these rush activities, all would
be forced into them after one
fraternity started. Upperclass-
men would have to spend half of
their year in active informal
rushing.

In order, therefore, to better
cope with these problems, I
would propose the following:

(1) The I. FP. C. will be free
to regulate contact between

freshmen and upperclassmen on
the weekend and Friday night.

(2) Freshmen will not be al-
lowed to eat meals in fraternity
houses from Monday through
Friday during the first semester
of 1966-67.

These minimum requirements
are necessary to prevent rush
from becoming too expensive,
time-consuming, and a nulsance
to upperclassmen and freshmen
alike.

While we view the Vietnamese
on our side as “cowardly” and

officers describe the Viet Cong

never out of the feeling that
they ‘‘are fighting for demo-

cracy ... freedom . . . the
people ....” according to the
writer.

South Vietnamese troops and
commanders ‘know that if they
don’t bother the Viet Cong they
will be safe from Viet Cong at-
tacks.”

In conclusion the much-de-
corated Duncan says that he has
no criticism of young American
anti-war demonstrators: ‘On the
contrary. I am relieved. I think
they should be commended . . .
They are opposed to people, our
own and others, dying for a lie,
thereby corrupting the very

UP

A trip to the P. O. is rarely fruitless for a Wild:

cat basketball player.

Fan mail comes in steadily

to them all season. Most letters are picture or auto-

graph requests,

although every now and then a

child’s or teenage gir!’s letter takes a different tact.

“DEAR MR. SNYDER”
The typical letter received by senior Dick Sny-

der reads like this:
Dear Mr. Snyder,

! am a great admirer of yours. | would be
deeply grateful if you would send me a picture
of yourself. 1 hope you have a good season; the
same goes for the whole Davidson team.

Your admirer,
Scott B.

Another letter, a bit more personal:

Dear Mr. Snyder,

| am nine years old and | have watched you
play basketball for two years and | think you. are
a good athlete to play basketball for two years.
1 would appreciate it if you would give me
your autograph. Say hello to Rodney (Knowles)

for me please.

If you can catch him, | would

appreciate it if | could get his autograph too.

Sencerly,
Steven

From a teenage girl came this one to the “Dav-

idson Athletic Board.”
Dear Sirs:

basketball team. I’ve been a fan ever since | was
old enough to understand basketball. And ! just
have to tell you that Dick Snyder is my “fella.”
i think the Wildcats will go all the way this year.
I know they will win the Southern Conference
Championship, | just know they will.

Could you send me a picture of Dick Snyder
by himself and autographed? | was at Davidson
the day of the free basketball clinic and if just
broke my heart that | wasn’t the lucky girl who

got the

asketball and kiss from Dick Snyder.

But my Mother and Father said that if it had
been me they would have had to bury me. |
hope you are not annoyed by me writing.

Yours truly,
Shelia

P. S. Good luck, Wildcats.
From Statesville came this one:

Dear Dick,
