Beanies Substitute
es
For Frosh Hazing
By BOS BUCHANAN
Staft Weiter
Beanle-wearing, Davidson's long-time freshman

tradition, was at first only a substitute for hazin
according to the man most responsible {or its found-
ing.

. Dr. Armand L. Currie, a 1921 graduate and now
a retired Presbyterian minister here. says beanies
were first put on freshmen heads as a “compromise
to upperclassmen when hazing was outlawed.

Prior to 1923, hazing was rampant on the Da-
yidson campus as it was on most other college cam-
ses, “Things were pretty bad,” said Currie. “The
reshmen and sophomores were fighting all the
time. There was a big chinaberry tree where the
Dana Science Building is now. The branches of this
tree touched the ground and all day long the fresh-
men and sophomores fought under the tree.

“The athletic teams and fraternities were the
principal proponents of hazing at initiations. Fresh-
men were badly beaten and sometimes badly in-
jured.”

As president of the Student Council in 1921
Currie was concerned about this hazing. ‘] thought
that the student body should grow up.’

The situation reached its worst point that year
when all the lettermen were expelled from school
as a result of the severe hazing. They were read-
mitted only after the D Club was abolished.

Currie remained in Davidson two years after -
his graduation as secretary of the YMCA, principal h
of Davidson High School, and coach of the Davidson
College baseball team. An underlying reason for his -
rematning was the hope that he could do something
to abolish hazing permanently.

“in the second semester of 1923 the student
body voted to discontinue hazing for three months.

“This experiment was very successful and at
the end of the period the student body voted to dis-
continue the tradition of hazing freshmen.

“This resulted in a new regime. From then on
freshmen were required to wear beanies as a com:
promise measure.”

To Currie's knowledge, Davidson was the first
school to initiate the practice of freshmen beantes
and one of the first Southern schools to reform the
hazing pdlicy.

Currie had pastorates in a number of states,
mast recently Nashville, Tenn., before retiring to |
Pine Road in Davidson. He is married to the former |
Eloise Martin, daughter of Dr. W. J. Martin, college

president while Currie was a student. .
