The Sweat Band Incident

I was cold last Saturday as I sat in the stands by
the tennis courts watching George Berner play his
number one singles match. The air had a chill to it,
and the wind was blowing. Everyone there was shiv-
vering. Everyone except George. He had just asked
Coach Harry Fogleman to bring him a sweat band for
his wrist.

‘Funny thing about that sweat band. “It will be
the turning point of the match,” said one fan as George
slid the band on his wrist. “But he’s putting the band
on his left wrist, and he’s right-handed,” commented
another. “That’s just it,” said a third. “His opponent
will be so busy trying to figure out why he has it on
his left wrist instead of his right, he won’t be able to
concentrate on his game.”

“Great story,” thought I, as I considered the in-
cident’s possibilities as column material. “I think I'll
stick around and see.” Now I know that you aren't
going to believe this, but the sweat band incident
proved to be the turning point of the match.

George had been having a rather rough time with
his opponent from East Tennessee State. The little guy
came into the match with his mind set on upsetting
George, and he had won the first few games to make
his intentions quite clear. And something was wrong
with George’s racket, too. Every time he tried to re-
turn a serve, the wood hit the ball instead of the strings.
Something had to be done. So George called on the
sweat band. It worked. His opponent was only able to
win one more game in the entire match, and George
had chalked up another victory.

Actually, George attributed his victory to another
factor and denied all knowledge of the sweat band
incident. “All I wanted the wrist band for,” he said
later, ‘“‘was to wipe the perspiration from my forehead.”
And why the left wrist instead of the right? “It just
happened that way,” he said, ruining a perfectly won-
derful story. The real reason for. the change in the
course of the match, as George saw it, was his oppon-
ent’s anger after a close call in the next game.

In that game, George called one of his opponent’s
serves wide. His opponent, becoming slightly upset at
the call, told George that he thought the serve was in
play. Being a good sport at heart, George replied that
he could have made a mistake, and that he would give
him two serves, the courteous thing to do. Not being
quite satisfied by George’s generosity, his foe jumped
over the net to see if he could find a vestige of his
serve on the “in” side of the center line. After the two
of. them searched in vain for several minutes, George
concluded that his call was correct, his adversary
grumbled and climbed back over the net and play con-
tinued. The next serve was good, and George, not wish-
ing to be outdone, smashed it back toward the net. The
ball lacked the height to clear the net entirely, but
managed to drop on the opponent's side, completely
unplayable. In his inimitable, ethnic manner, George
flashed a sly grin at the crowd and continued.

“After that,” George said, ‘“‘he couldn’t do a thing.
He just kept getting madder, and that made it funny.”

The likeable Finn, who plans to return, home in
June to play on his country’s Davis Cup team, cited his
opponent’s misfortunes as one of the funny aspects of
his game. “There is just so much to do in tennis,” he
said, “so much to think about, that you can’t afford to
get mad. He got mad out there; his playing showed it.”
The same thing had happened to George earlier in the
week in his match with Harvard’s John Levin. “I had
him at game, set, match point,” he said, “and then a
couple of simple mistakes caused me to get mad at
myself. I couldn’t concentrate on my game and I blew
it.” George had Levin 5-1 in the final set, and ended up
losing the set and the match 8-10. “That was the first
time I have ever lost on a match point,” he added.
“I guess it was sort of like the Davidson-West Virginia
basketball game.”

Not appearing to be terribly upset at his loss as he
reflected back on the match, George blamed his mis-
takes on over-confidence, and added, “I’m just glad
the loss came on a day when the team won anyway.”

individual’s racket.

Pitchers Shine, But
’Cat Nine Loses Two

By BILL BERRY
Sports Writer

Two Davidson pitchers
turned ‘in top performances,
Wildcat hittera topped op
posing team batting, and the
charges of Coach Tom Stev
ens were stil! unable to chalk
up a game in the win column
this week.

The Wildcat nine dropped
two shutouts in three days
this week, losing to Belmont
Abbey 4-0 on Tuesday and
to The Citadel yesterday by
a score of 1-0.

The team scattered six
hits yesterday afternoon, but
were unable to put together
an effective rally.

Southpaw sophomore Clark
Nickerson pitched eight in.
nings in the game, allowing
only one run and four hits, all
singles. The lone Citadel! run
came across from third in the
fourth inning as an attempt.
ed double play failed.

Davidson had an opportu-
nity to tie the score in the
eighth inning but a mental
error on the part of a ‘Cat
baserunner spoiled the rally.

The bases were loaded in
the eighth with one out when

Junior Greg Cox played the
role of super-star yesterday
afternoon as he placed in
seven events to lead the
Wildcat track team to an
easy victory over the Univ-
ersity of North Carolina at
Charlotte.

Hearon
Slowed By
Hurt Back

Dan Hearon, the number
three player on Davidson's
defending Southern Confer-
ence Champion tennis team,
is recovering from a back in-
jury, which he suffered in a
match against East Tennes-
see State University last Sat-
urday. ,

The injury. described by
Davidson tennis coach Harry
Fogleman as “a pulled back
muscle,” occurred While
Hearon was serving. He
was ahead 5.2 in the first set
of the match, but the injury
greatly reduced his effective-
ness. allowing his opponent
to overtake him for the win.

Since the match with East
Tennessee was a close one,
Hearon attempted to play his
doubles match rather than
forefit. His partner in the
doubles, sophomore Randy
Jones. played great tennis in
an attempt to compensate
for the crippled Hearon.

When David Jennings won
his match to ensure a David-
son team victory, Hearon and
Jones immediately default-
ed.

THE CELLAR

Davidson swept 14 of .17
events to demolish the UNC-
C team 113% -28%.

Cox picked up 20% points
as he won the high hurdles
in. 15.2, the broad jump with
a best effort of 21-44%, and he
ran a leg on the winning 440
relay team.

In addition he placed sec-
ond in the 100 and 200-yard
dashes, second in the triple
jump and third in the high
jump.

Teammates Rick Lyon and
Steve Kirley also were mul-
tiple winners in the meet held
on the Wildcat track:

Lyon swept the 100 in 9.8
and the 220 in 22.0, while
Kirley took the shot put and
discuss competition -with
throws of 42-6 and 128 feet.

The meet was the most
successful of the year for the
cindermen, as they were able
to combine depth with num-
erous wins to take the meet
with ease.

ee

Gordon Slade grounded -a
ball to the Citadel second
baseman. The player tag-
ged the runner going to sec.
ond and flipped to first to
double up Slade.

Several players noted after
the game that the double
play could have been avoid-
ed if the runner from first
had hesitated a moment.

Slade and Hank Strickland
each picked up two hits in
the game.

In Tuesday's contest, fresh.
man hurler Wade Shepherd
allowed only five Belmont
Abbey hits, but found them
all bunched together, arid
came. out on the short end
of a 4-0 score.

The runs all came in one

inning as Wildcat errors ac-
cented the hitting of the Cru-
sader players. Shepherd gave
up only one earned run in
the contest. while the ‘Cats
committed four fielding mis-
takes.

The Davidson nine once
again outhit their opponents.
as they collected six hits, but
as in the Citadel contest, they
could not put them together
for a rally.

Gordon Slade and Pat Reed
collected five of the six
Davidson hits. as Slade went
three for four and Reed turn-
ed in a two for four per
formance.

The team faced Marshall
University this afternoon in
trying to find their second
win in 14 games.
