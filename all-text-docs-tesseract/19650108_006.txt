Study Day

Scheduled

For Pre-Exam Work

A pre-examination study day
will be held on Tuesday, Jan.
19. the first time that such a
day has been included in the ex-
amination schedule at Davidson.

F. W. Hengeveld. registrar,
announced that the day will be
designed for the students’ bene-
fit. There will be no classes and
no required exercises. Although
originally listed on the Union
Calendar as scheduled for Tues-

day, there will be no chapel on
the pre-examination study day.

Hengeveld also announced that
the Tuesday - Thursday - Satur-
day classes will be held on Mon-
day, Jan. 18. the day before
the pre-examination study day in
place of the normal classes. This
will equalize the M-W-P classes
with the T-T-S classes for the
semester.

Dr. Joseph T. Drake. chairman
of the academie scheduling
committee, explained that the
committee had been consider-
day to the schedule for some
years. Many students had been
requesting it, and last year the
Student Council endorsed the
idea. The University of North
Carolina and Duke University
have scheduled similar days for
several years.

The cornmittee last year re-
ferred the suggestion to the fac-
ulty. who strongly approved of
the ided. Drake commented that
the professors likewise will ben-
efit from the study day by get-
ting a chance to prepare exams
or mark papers.

A similar pre-examination

Greek Week Planned

Greek Week — the last
step before initiation for
fraternity pledges—will be-
gin alongside second se-
mester classes on Monday,
Feb. 1 at 6:30 p.m. with the
customary banquet in the
Union and will continue
through 11 p.m. Saturday,
Feb. 6.

Activities will begin at 1 p.m.
each day except Monday and
must end by 10 p.m. Monday
through Thursday and by 11
p.m. Friday and Saturday.

Addeé to this year’s activi-
ties is a Pledge Class Field
Day which will begin at 1 p.m.
on Wednesday, Feb. 3.

Part of the pre-initiation cere-
monies of Greek Week include
some constructive project, usual-
ly a work project carried on off
campus. In the past these pro-
jects have included work at
the Lake Campus, repair work
at local churches, and painting
and repairs on schools, chil-
drens’ homes. and public health
buildings.

During Greek Week no form
of “hazing.” personal abuse. or
personel indignity will be al-
lowed. Included in the list of
prohibited acts are paddling,
forced eating. activities inter-
fering with digestion, “mud
wallowing,’ required stud run-
ning or other personal service,
shoe shining, and any obscene

1H

or vulgar activities. The com-
plete list of prohibited activi-
ties with the exception of “mud
wallowng’’ can be found on
page 75. of the Wildcat Hand-
book.

Also prohibited are any prac-
tices which would possibly re-
sult in physical harm or inter-
rupt regular classes. Violations
of these rules may incur up to a
$100 individual fine or a $500
fraternity fine, depending on

the seriousness of the offense.
The primary responsibility for
the enforcement of these regu-
lations is vested in the frater-
nity laison officer, Robert
Jones.

In charge of Greek Week ac-|
tivities for the IFC is Bill Alex-
ander, who must instruct pledge
trainers in the Greek Week reg-
ulations and must generally
oversee the activities of Greek
Week.

Committee

Arranges Calendar

Prof. Joseph T. Drake. head
‘sf the Academic Scheduling
Committee, has announced the
calendar for the 1965-66 school
year with classes beginning on
| Sept. 15 and Commencement set
\for June 4-5.

“In an effort to make things
easier for the Athletic Schedul-
ing Committee. tentative sched-
ules have been drawn up as far
in advance as the 1968-69 school
year,” said Drake.

Next year’s calendar retains
the pre-exam study days and a
spring vacation with two week-
ends. both of these being insti-
tuted by Drake and his commit-
tee. Thanksgiving vacation will
be Nov. 23-29 while Christmas
holidays begin Dec. 18 and end
Jan. 3. First semester exams.
following a reading day, will run
Jan. 19-27.

Second semester begins on
Jan. 31 after a three-day mid-
term break. Spring vacation is
stated for March 26-April 4 and

second semester exams last May
25-June 2. The’ two-day Com-
mencement ceremonies will be
held June 4-5.

As is necessary this year.
next year’s schedule calls for
the TTS classes to meet on
Monday. Jan. 17, 1965 in order
to give a total of 45 TTS class
periods each semester. There
will be 46 MWF class sessions
each semester of the 1965-66
term.

study day will be held on Tues-
day, May 2th. the day before
the second semester exams be-
gin. Also, these study days have
been included in next year’s
calendar. Drake further com-
mented that unless these days
are grossly misused and their
obvious benefits wastea by the

students, they will probably be
continued in future years.

Ticket Prices Criticized

Py HEYWARN CagTeco
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Recently various members of the student body have

expressed the opinion that Davidson students ought to
“home” basketball games free. By the}

be allowed to al

term “home games” they apparently mean those played
in the Charlotte Coliseum as well as those in Johnston

Gym on campus.

These students contend. that
home games should be free to
the student body no matter
where played and that the pres-
ent half-price Coliseum game
is unfair and is only a means
for the Athletic Department
to obtain extra revenue.

Dr. Paul A. Marrotte, chair-
man of the Faculty Athletic
Committee, has said,.“In prin-
ciple I believe that the students
should be admitted free to
every game,” although he makes
it clear that he realizes that
there may be circumstances
which would make this imprac-
tical as well as economically
unwise.

A suggestion which he feels
would do a great deal in sett-
ling this controversy is that a
group representing the student

YMCA

FORUM

Sex Attitude Changes
Topic Of Evaluation

Contemporary attitudes

on sex and ethics will be

examined in a series of forums during the next semester
under the sponsorship of the YMCA.

Under the planning of Jay
Federman, chairman of the For-
um Committee, five speakers
representing a variety of view-
points have been invited to the
campus to speak in chapel, lead
an informal discussion in the
afternoon, and give a lecture
the following evening. The series
will be oriented towards allow-
ing each student to develop a
deeper understanding of the
problem. especially in its rela-
tionship towards the church to-
day.

Since there nas been a revolu-

John Birch Group
To Be Discussed

Merits and demerits of the
John Birch Society will be the
topic of discussion at next Tues-

day's meeting of the Conserva-
tive Club. according to Presi-

dent Dan Campbell. This will be
the last meeting of this semester
for the club.

Next semester's plans include
having an outside speaker from
the faculty or elsewhere at least
every other bimonthly meeting.
Other programs will consist of
student reports and discussions.
The club will sponsor one more
chapel program.

This speaker will be sponsored
jointly by the club and the In-
tercollegiate Society of Individ-
ualists, a nonprofit student or-
ganization with which the club
is affiliated.

According to Campbell the
club intends to present programs
and discussions not only on poli-
ties, but also on such subjects
as education, economics, and re-
ligion.

During the first semester the
club had several outside speak-
ers at its meetings and also
sponsored a chapel program.
Program speakers included Per-
ry Morgan of the Charlotte News
and Alan Newcomb of WBT.

tion in sex values throughout
the Western World in recent
years, the YMCA hopes that the
forums will afford a clear pic-
ture of any ethical problems
which might have arisen along
with the breakdown of old norms
and traditions.

The topic will be explored
from anthropological. sociologi-
cal, psychological. and religious
perspectives in the course of
the series with a View towards
allowing each student to make
a choice of his position.

The first speaker will be
Ethel Nash. who will treat such
subjects as the current crisis
in masculinity and femininity,
and the sociological transition of
sex values in the Western
World.

Among the following speakers
will be John Rule, speaking on
the problems of college admin-
istrations in attempting to regu-
late sex, and Harvey Cox, speak-
ing on contemporary Christian
attitudes. A more liberal posi-
tion will be set forth by Paul
Goodman. while a member of
the Catholic clergy will explain
the conservative position.

body meet with the Faculty
Athletic Committee and present
the student views on the prob-
lem.

If such action were taken
the committee could then pre-
sent to Dr. Tom Scott, Director
of Athletics, whatever proposals
they had adopted from this con-
ference. Such action would
have to be initiated by the stu-
dents or the Student Council,
however.

In answer to the question of
free student
games, Scott stated that he
does not believe that such an

idea is practical. In the first]:

place, Davidson charges the
students no specfiic athletic
fee, as do many other colleges,”
but instead includes this in a
general fee encompassing such
things as medical expenses, the
yearbook and other publications.

Secondly, alt games played in
the Coliseum fimancially obligate
Davidson to the Coliseum for 10
per cent of the gate receipts
and to the visiting team for
some predetermined amount.
(In games such as William and
Mary, for example, the visiting
team receives 50 per cent of the
take. Scott pointed out.) Fur-
thermore combined student.
faculty and administration seat-
ing takes up approximately 20
percent of the seats in the Coli-
seum.

As a result. when the stu-
dents are admitted free to a
home game the school gets only
35 per cent of the gate, usually.

(An automatic 10 per cent to
the Coliseum, 20 per cent in
free seating. and one-half of the
remaining 70 per cent to the
visiting team.)

This leaves very little for the
athletic department, especially
when travelling expenses to
places like St. Joseph’s (where
Davidson received only $1500—
not enough to pay expenses)
and to Southern Conference
games (where the school re-
ceives no compensation at all)
are taken into consideration.

At present the student is guar-
anteed. 10 free games. Seven are
played on campus in Johnston
Gym and the remaining three
are in Charlotte. They are Wake
Forest (already played) and
George Washington and West
Virginia (to be played next
month). On: the schedule set up
this year, there is no one single
game in the Coliseum which the
students are required to pay for
during the regular school term
(excepting Christmas holidays).

FEARS BACKFIRE

Council Turns Down
Proposed Vow Study

Student Council has set aside,
for the present. its plan to ap-
poirt a -ommittee to formulate
a stand on the Faculty oath.

This move came at the Coun-
cil's weekly meeting Tuesday
after President Will Jackson pre-
sented a report on his investiga-
‘tion into the possibility that such
a stand might interfere with the
efforts of the faculty and admin-
istration in this area.

“Any effort on our part right
now would hurt their cause more
than help it.’ said Jackson. re-
lating the opinions of those mem-
bers of the administration he
had consulated on the matter.

The group had decided at
any earlier meeting to delay ap-
pointment of the committee
pending Jackson's investigation
in spite of the fact that the work.

of the committee would not be
presented until this spring.

Jackson telt that the mere ap-
pointment of the committee. not
just its decision. might damage
the efforts of the faculty or ad-
ministration.

At the same meeting, David
Powell continued to express con-
cern over the lack of a signal
at the railroad crossing on Grif-
fth Street. He said that a serious
accident occurred there during
the Christmas Holidays.

Powell further noted that
many other persons were becom-
ing concerned over this situa-
tion, and said that he would con-
tinue in his efforts to have a
signal installed.

Fred Sackett. Don Davidson.
and John Barrow were not pre-
sent at the meeting.
