Women split two in conference play

On their rigorous Southern Con-
ference schedule, the women’s tennis
team faced Appalachian State and UNC-
Greensboro earlier this month. The
team crushed App. State to bring them
closer
to the
.500
mark,
and
then
dropped.
a
match
to UNCG to leave them at 6-7 on the
season.

The Wildcats gave up only one
point to the Mountaineers. Dana Casner,
the perennial #1 player, and rookie
Kristen Koenig each won their matches
in straight sets, as did Lynne Shore and
Brenna Tindall at the #5 and #6 spots.

THE DAVIDSO? IAN

Claire Cheatwood, playing #3, won
her match after the opponent forced a

. third set. Cheatwood won the first set 7-

5 and lost the second 1-6. The final set
ended 6-4 in favor of Cheatwood to
give Davidson five of the six singles
matches.

The Wildcats swept the doubles
matches to ‘win the doublés point as
well. At the #1 doubles spot, Casner
and Koenig handily defeated their op-
ponents 8-1. Shore and Clara Marks
won 8-2 at the #2 spot, as did Tindall
and Cheatwood at #3.

Marks, at #4 singles, was the only
Wildcat to lose a match to the Moun-
taineers. She rebounded from a goose
egg in the first set to win the second 6-
2 and force a third set. However, Marks
could not complete the comeback and
lost the third set.

The momentum of the strong win
over App. was not enough to carry the
wonem past the Spartans of UNCG.

In a nine point match, Davidson

won four singles matches to tie the
Spartans, but lost the doubles point.
The final score was 54 in favor of
UNCG.

Casner lost the first match to
UNCG’s top player to put Davidson
down by a point. Koenig tied the match
up again with a 6-2, 6-4 win., and Am-
ber Bradford won at the #3 spot 6-4, 7-
5.

A Davidson victory looked likely
after the first three matches, but the
Spartans swept the next three matches
to go up by two points. Clara Marks and
Anna Holland, playing #7 and #8, re-
sponded by winning their matches to
once again tie up the match.

The doubles point would be the
difference between a win and a loss.
Lynne Shore and Marks won a very
hard-fought match by ascore of 9-8, but
it proved inconsequential. UNCG won
the other two doubles matches to clinch
the doubles point and victory in the
match.

Lady Wildcats tennis routes Pitt.,
road match to WVU

loses close

BY ALISON KALETT
Staff Writer

This past Saturday was a busy one
for the Davidson women’s tennis team.
At West Virginia the Lady Wildcats
took on both West Virginia University
and the University of Pittsburgh. The
University of Pittsburgh proved no
match
for the
Wild-
cats as
Davison
swept
all
singles

- matches
as well as winning doubles due to a
Pittsburgh forfeit. However, against
West Virginia University, Davidson en-
countered a much toughter opponent
and ended up losing the overall match
by a narrow 6 to 3 margin.

Against the University of Pitts-
burgh, all Davidson singles players had
relatively easy straight set ‘victories.
This was especially true at #1 and #2
singles where Freshman Kristen Koenig
and Junior Dana Casner each only

. dropped one game in their wins. The

remaining singles players: Bradford,
Cheatwood, Shone, and Marks also
cruised to their singles victories. Be-
cause Davidson led by an insurmount-
able 6 to 0 score after the singles, Pitts-
burgh chose to forfeit the doubles
matches.

Unfortunately, Davidson’s other
Saturday match against West Virginia
University was notnearly as easy. Three
of Davidson’s six singles matches went
to three sets. These included #1 seed
Dana Casner, who lost her match by a3-
6, 7-5, 6-1 score; #2 Kristen Koenig
who triumphed 7-5, 6-2, after dropping
the first set 3-6; and Lynne Shore who
lost her #5 singles match in a heart
breaking third set tiebreaker. Unfortu-
nately, #3 Amber Bradford and #4 Claire
Cheatwood lost their matches by re-
spective 6-0, 7-6 and 6-0, 6-2 margins.
However, Clara Marks won her match
in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4 improving her
personal recored to 2 and Oat #6 singles.
After all the singles matches were com-
plete WVU had 4 to 2 match edge.

Inorder for Davidson to come out
with a victory they needed-towin all
three doubles contests. This scenario
was not unlikey as all the doubles teams
had solid season records. At #1 doubles

the team of Casner and Koenig had a
tough and undoubtedly exciting match,
yet fell short of victory losing 9 to 7.
The #2 team of Bradford and Cheatwood
won their close doubles match 8 to 6,
while improving their season record to
Sand 7. Lastly, the #3 team of Holland
and Marks fell by a close 8 to 5 score,
giving them a 500 (2-2) record for the
season. Because WVU won two of the
three doubles matches they claimed the
overall match by a 6 to 3 score.

Although Davidson lost to WVU,
the weekend can still be deemed suc-
cessful. The match against WVU was
extremely close and could have gone
either way. Not to mention that the
route of the University of Pittsburgh
undoubtedly added to team confidence.
Individually, players such as Kristen
Koenig and Clara Marks had outstand-
ing matches. Koenig upped her record
to 9 and 3 at #2 singles and 10 and 4
overall, while Marks garnered her third
and fourth vicories of the season.

The Women’s Tennis team now
owns a solid 7 and 8 record. Upcoming
matches include a contest at Western
Carolina on March 31, as well as a
home match against southern confer-
ence foe East Tennessee State.

and a third inning.
In the bottom of the fourth, ASU
finally succeeded in knocking Davidson

starter Eric Bowers off the mound. They

scored three more runs. They crucial
blow was a triple by’ ASU’s
thirdbaseman Mike Berrier. He knocked
in two runs. Berrier later scored on a
sacrifice hit by. shortstop Travis Pit-
man.

After two quiet innings, Davidson
reached the top of the sixth facing a four
run deficit. Mike DeSimone reached
first on a walk. Taking advantage of a
wild pitch by John Anderson, DeSimone
reached second. Next, Sloan doubled
for the ninth time this season, scoring
DeSimone. Marshall Tyler made it a
one run game when he hit his first
homerun of the season.

DeSimone came in to pitch in re-
lief of sophomore Jamie-McDonald in
the same inning. After giving upa walk
to Berrier, he responded to the situation
by picking him off at firstbase. The
next two hitters did nothing.

This set the stage for a Wildcat
comeback. After Ben Brown flied out
to left and Joyce struck out, the Cats
were down to their final out. Luke

Goodwin refused to be the last out,
singling to left. Mike DeSimone, ahero
in past games, now stepped to the plate.
With a swing of the bat, DeSimone put
the Cats up 12-11 as he sent the ball

‘over the leftfield fence. It was his fifth

homerun of the year.

After walking righfielder Andy
Cheek with two outs, DeSimone forced
John Anderson to fly out. DeSimone
pitched two scoreless and hitless in-
nings. For the season, his record is now
2-1.

DeSimone, who went 3 for 4 with
4 RBIs, was obviously the hero of the
game. Still, many Wildcats had good
games. Goodwin, Tyler, and Sloan all
had two hits. With his homerun, Tyler
had two RBIs.

On Sunday afternoon, the Wild-
cats tried to complete the sweep of the
Mountaineers. It was not to be as
Davidson was never able to recover
from an early 8-1 deficit.

ASU managed eleven runs on thir-

teen hits on the game. Five separate
Mountaineer hitters managed two hits
each against three Davidson pitchers. B
Both secondbaseman Shane Sigmon and
catcher Matt Dalton each had solo
homeruns. Andy Cheek, John Ander-

son, and Stephen Crater all had 2 RBIs

each.

While the final was 11-7 ASU,
Davidson scored six out of their seven
runs in the last four innings. Jeremiah
Parvin provided some fireworks for the
Cats when he hit his third homerun of
the year. Drew Williams also hit the
ball well, managing two hits. DeSimone
went 2 for 5 with 2 RBIs. On the series,
he finished 7 for 14 with a game-win-
ning homerun and 6RBIs. He also had
awinandasave. Parvin also had a good
series. He finished with four hits, two
of them homeruns.

While the Wildcats hoped for a
sweep, at this stage taking two out three
games in conference is a very good
achievement. It gives the Cats confi-
dence, something they’ ll need the rest
of the way. Davidson put together three
of their best games this weekend. The
starting pitching was much improved,
while the relief pitching was strong.
Also, a very pleasant surprise came
from the defense. The Cats only made
two errors during the weekend. Hope-
fully, the Cats will be able to use this
series as a stepping stone for the rest of
the season.

Davidson’s next game is at home
against ACC power Wake Forest on
Wednesday. :

TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 1998

(Right field heckling-

just jolly good fun

Davip RosENBERG
Staff Writer

From afar, during these peaceful
spring afternoons, one can hear the
echo of the gentle ting of a baseball
against a metal bat. The dugout is
filled with baseball chatter and an
umpire’s curdling yell can carry fora
mile. But most opposing teams’ night-
mare isn’t the starting pitcher’s slider
nor the shear power of Davidson’s
cleanup hitter.

It’s the hecklers out by right field.

They are like wrecking balls with
vocal chords.

One may think of hecklers as the
ill-clad, jersey doning, drunken fans
that hide cries of complaint behind
smelly beer belches. Those hecklers
found at professional sporting events
might yell brutish and rash insults
regarding the brand of combat boots a
hitter’s mother might wear or insist
that the first baseman’s conception
occurred as the result of a serious case
of beer goggles. But heckling at such
a prestigious academic institution as
Davidson College is quite different.

280 feet from home plate, be-
yond the right field wall lie two rows
of worn, wooden benches, classically
pounded into the dirt by slightly over-
weight Davidson students.

On a perfect afternoon, the sun
can shine just right, and tan lines may
become ever so more distinct. And
while the competition of the game
attracts many, the humorous heckling
of the visiting team amuses the masses
almost as much.

Perhaps the most unkind punish-
ment a coach could hand a delinquent
player would be a starting position in
right field against the Wildcats. Upon
learning of a starting position, a play-
ers knees may quiver; he may ner-
vously forget to spit the shells off of
his sunflower seeds, or begin pro-
fusely spreading oil on his glove,
mumbling to himself why he ever
took up the silly game of baseball.

“Davidson Heckling” entails
deep research into the life of an inno-
cent right fielder. Students utilize the

. investigative skills that have brought

them to such a place and formulate
smart puns and plays on words that
leave home fans chuckling to them-
selves and.in wait of the next bout of
humor. Cries of, “I’ve seen better
swings in a playground!” and “I’ve
seen better cuts from safety scissors!”
bounce off the team bleachers as grin-
ning fans shake their heads at the
jolly-good pleasantry.

Though the puns may be énter-
taining, nothing can satisfy an audi-
ence better than bringing out old dirt
on opposing players, as was the case
with the starting Cincinatti right fielder
who will remain nameless but we will
refer to simply as “Bud”.

Through intense database re-
search and consultation of private
sources, the heckling crew learned
that Bud enjoyed videotaping himself
and his girlfriend in intimate settings.

Need we say more?

. Hearty laughs and backslapping
of fellow buddies filled the crowd
after each sly comment about Bud’s
private films. Unfortunately for the
Wildcats, however, Bud used the heck-
ling humor to springboard outstand-
ing five for six hitting for the day. Bud
found himself so perturbed by the
insults that in mid-stride towards sec-
ond base, the right field fans received
the gift of his middle finger.

Such a gift gave those Wildcat
fans their heartiest laugh of the after-
noon, and they returned their focus to
the game at hand, anticipating the
next chance to construct a clever pun.
Unfortunately that day, the baseball
team lost to Cincinnatti and the Wild-
cats returned to the showers with sul-
len looks on their faces.

However, with all due respect to
the Davidson baseball team, it need
not worry about a drop in fan atten-
dance. Whatever the outcome of the
game may be, and however many
games the team may lose in a season,
fans will always be quick to drop their
studies to catch a quick game - granted
the weather stay fair and the clouds
shy away from gamedays.

Heckling is just so damn fun.

12 runners set season bests at Emory

BY BRATTON HOLMES
Sports Editor

On a sunny, 82 degree day in
Atlanta, the track teams saw their first
true day of spring and had to deal with
it. Despite the balmy conditions, a
dozen runners set season best times,
and . seven of them were personal
bests.

28 teams competed at the Emory
Classic, including Southern Confer-
ence rivals Western Carolina, who

‘won the meet, and Furman. Thomas
McElveen was the first to set a per-
sonal best for the men. In the 1500,
McElveen beat his previous best time
by five seconds by finishing the race
in 4:07:92. This was also the team’s
best time this season.

Keith Chapman hada season best
time in the 800, finishing in 1:59.55.
In the steeplechase, the Wildcats had
two solid finishes from Tim O’ Keefe
and Scott Hutchins. O’ Keefe posted a
time of 10:33.67. Hutchins improved
over his previous time by almost 40
seconds, finishing in 10:51.46.

The 4x400 relay team had its best
time of the season by four seconds,
finishing with a time of 3:29.80. The
relay team consisted of Chapman, Ade
Artis, Mike Albert, and Karim
Lawrence.

For the women, several runners
set personal and season bests. Miranda

Todd had a personal best in the 100m,

‘second in the event.

as did Kathleen Shields in the 1500.
In the 3000m race, Kate Feldmeyer
and Clare Frey each had personal bests
and finished 11th and 13th: respec-
tively in the event.

Freshman Smyth Bitter ran her
fastest time ever in the 1500m with a
time of 4:46, good enough to finish
Her time was
three hundredths of a second shy of
the Junior National Qualifying mark.

Jamilah Sawyer, who continues
to make headlines with her ever-im-
proving times, had a season best time
in the 100 hurdles. Her time of 14.86
gave her second place in the event and
places her among the top runners in
the conference.

Junior Jenny Klotz had a season
best inthe 10,000m, finishing in 43:50.
Jill Neumayer finished ninth in the
800m with a season best time of 2:21.
Suzy Burr also finished 15th in the
event with a season best 2:26.

The 4x400 relay feam followed
suit from the men by posting a season
best time of 4:13, which gave them an
eighth place finish in the event. Bitter,
Burr, Neumayer, and Sawyer ran in
the relay.

In what Assistant Coach Tho-
mas Cason said was the team’s best
meet of the season, the runners set at
least a season best in almost every
event: The improvement was clear
and gives reason to be optomistic about

the Duke Invitational this weekend.
