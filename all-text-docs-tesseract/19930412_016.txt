Real Estate Broker Turned Mayor Talks about Davidson

By Leigh Rawdon
How did you become the mayor of
Davidson?

I entered the political arena in
1977 as a commissioner. I was
appointed to fillan unexpired term
of the ex-mayor in September of
1984 so I ‘ve been the mayor since
1984. I grew up in Davidson on a
farm just outside of town. My
grandfather and his brothers-built
about half the stores in downtown
Davidson so it has been in the
family.

It has been a long time ambi-
tion of mine to get some of these
buildings back in the family and I
probably am the largest property
owner in downtown Davidson.
Now along with Mr. Clark who
owns that whole block up there but
I own all these buildings here, the
two more where the dress shop is,
where my real estate office is,
where the antique store is, but
Davidson is home and other than
going away to school and the army
I’ve spent my entire life here.

What changes have you seen hap-
pen in Davidson?

Well, as a child growing up
here my daddy and mother worked
in a grocery store and at the time
there probably were five grocery
stores on Main Street, a drug store,
two barbar shops, a clothing store,
and a hardware store. At one time
where The Mecklenburg Gazette
is, there was a service station right
there with gas pumps right on the
side of the street. Where the Gulfis

as a child growing up there was a’

movie theater ‘til it burned. So
how Davidson supported four or
five grocery stores back then with
alot fewer people is amystery but
we didn’t have all the big shopping
centers and super markets and so
forth so back then if youcall upand
order the groceries by phone and
the grocery store would deliver the
groceries to you. That’s been a
long time ago.

How has the size of the town
changed?

The town has grown some
but not drastically. Ithas grown in
proportion really based on the way
the college has grown. Thecollege
has always been and continues to
be the largest employer in
town...either you have a spouse
working there or a parent working
there or your girlfriend works there;
three fourths of the people in town
are tied in some way with some-
thing that happens at Davidson
College.

How do you see the relationship
between the college and the town?

It is a good relationship. The
people don’t realize that the col-
lege in a town our size, better than
twenty five percent of the property
in our town is tax exempt becuase
itis anon profit corporations. And
that is an astronomical number,
percentage wise in a small town
and that lowers your tax levies to
how much money is coming in but

to live in.

over the years when the town has
really had a real need the college
has come forward and made con-
tributions they have helped us to
buy fire trucks, they helped us with
the downtown plan and they’ve
been good corporate citizens and
we have a good relationship.

How would you describe Davidson
to someone who has never been
here before?

I think it is a unige town in
that we are made up of quaint shops.
The tempois not very brisk, people
are not always in hurry, it is not as
hustle and bustle as a lot of big

the commercial development we
see in Cornelius?

It is two things. The number
one thing is the fact that this road
that goes out of Davidson, Griffith
Street, goes nowhere; it runs into
the lake. And when people are
building fast foods and businesses
like that they want traffic going
both ways where it passes there
and I think that is one reason.

But the other reason is that
our zoning has been very strict in
what you can and can’t do. Usu-
ally fast foods like to locate close
to interchange and unfortunately

if Shoney’s or somebody like that,
wanted to come as long as they
don’t have a drive up restaurant
there wouldn’t be anything keep-
ing them from coming. But I think
the biggest thing is the demand
and the fact that the road goes
nowhere,

What are the issues facing
Davidson right now?

A problem that is spiraling is
the cost of picking up garbage and
treating it is going sky high with
what it is costing us to treat it. As
McKlenburg county grows this
way, with itis coming more crime.

What sort of
changes do you
foresee in the
next twenty
years?

there have been

that I would say is
a problem con-

town of that has increased

Davidson than there have been in
in the past so I think that’s going to
be something for us to cope with.
Weare having more growth quicker
than we anticipated. I think with
what is happening in government
in McKlenburg county where they
are promoting growth to come
north and it is coming north. It is
selling here and on into Iredell
county.

I don’t ever see a lot of indus-
try locating in Davidson but I think
you’re going to find industry try-
ing to get just inside of Iredell
county to avoid Mecklenburg
county taxes and as a result and
that ought to create more jobs for
people who want to live in
Davidson but also itis conceivable

that it will create more traffic and ©

congestion for Davidson.

Why is that in Davidson there are
no fast food restaurants or any of

the same company owned all four
corners and they didn’t want fast
food to start on this corner for how
it might impact the other corner.
Unfortunately that same company
now has gone bankrupt, so now
the two corners of the interchange
on [the east] side of the interstate
have been foreclosed by five, six,
seven, eight different banks, so
that very well could be a problem
for us into the future as to what
happens out there.

Our zoning does not preclude
a fast food from opening in
Davidson; it does preclude them
from having those drive up win-
dows where you eat in the parking
lot and those kind of things. Sol
think there are some restricitons
within our ordinance that have not
made it appealing for people to
want to locate there. But to do
nothing with the land that is out
there, that is zoned for restaurant,

drastically this year as a result of
some of the things that have hap-
pened on campus that caused a lot
of them to come off campus, so
hopefully, we are having some
meetings now with some of the
students who live off campus,
meetings with some of the land-
lords who rent to students off cam-
pus and hopefully we can find a
solution that will be both compat-
ible for both the neighborhood and
the town government and the stu-
dents in the college.

Do youever address race relation
problems?

We have very very few. Cer-
tainly over the years there have
been a few but we have acommu-
nity relations committee. This is
one charge that they are given: to

-monitor race relations and that was

created, oh gosh, years: ago when

people, they are’

we did have some problems when
integration was just starting, but
now the function of that commit-
tee is more just a pulse of what is
happening in the community and
notnecessarily race because I mean
it’s, well, any problem that might
be happening in the community,
this is a sounding board for the
mayor and the town government
about what needs to be addressed.
We’ vehad very very few race prob-
lems in town.

How do you explain that the races
are still divided geograghically?

That is true...that is some-
thing that has been in existence
ever since Davidson has been in
existence. There has not been as
much movement into the white.
community or the white commu-
nity moving there. It is still some-
what divided.

Where do most people in the town
work?

The college is the largest em-
ployer now. A lot-of those people
at the college and Ingersoll-Rand
(being the numbertwo), come from
all around. They drive in from
Outside to work here. We have a
lot of people who commute from
Charlotte to work in Charlotte but

it is a pretty good mixture. Cer-

tainly a lot more people come into
Davidson to work than go to Char-
lotte to work.

Is there anything you would like to
add? —

Several years ago The
Davidsonian interviewed me and I
made a quote in there about my
philosophy on growth as the mayor
since I was in the real estate busi-
ness. Somewhere in Atlanta, an
alum read the thing and he tells the
Atlanta newspaper and the Atlanta
newspaper gets their reporter who
lives in Winston Salem to come
down here and interview me onmy
philosophy on growth.

A lot of people consider me a
threat as far as growth in that Iam
in the real estate business and
people think that’s all I’m inter-
ested in, and I do tell them that
after all I have to live here and I
want to see orderly growth but lam
not one just for the sake of selling
the houses to want to plug up the
streets where you can’t move and
enjoy a normal life so that is a
perception that I have had to work
hard so that people do not percieve
meas somebody who because Iam
the mayor and because I am in the
real estate business.that all I want
to do is to see how many houses I
can put in Davidson, that’s not the
case at all.

What would you like to particu-

larly accomplish as mayor of
Davidson?

I only hope we can retain our
identity as a small college village
where everybody willalways know
each other. The hustle bustle will
not come to Davidson like it has to
a lot of other towns.
