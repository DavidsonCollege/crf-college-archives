Sports Editor Emeritus Jason Richards ’08 led Davidson with 21 points and five

assists including five three-pointers as the Wildcats survived a
rare quiet night from Stephen Curry *10 to earn a road victory
over Big South Conference leader Winthrop on Friday night.
The game was part of ESPN’s Bracketbuster Event, which pits
some of the nation’s best mid-major programs against each
other. With the win the ’Cats improved to 21-6 (18-0 in SoCon)
on the season.

The Wildcat basketball team pulled off an amazing overtime
comeback against Wofford for an 84-76 victory but could not
continue its four-game winning streak against Furman, losing
77-66.

Julia Paquette "10 matched her career high mark against
Wofford, scoring 23 points to lead Davidson. Alex Thompson
and Mercedes Robinson ’09 also hit double digits, tallying 18
and 14 points, respectively. Robinson also collected 13 rebounds
to secure her league-leading twelfth double-double of the sea-
son. Wofford also boasted three players with double figures with
Natalie Gramblin leading her team with 15,

But individual performances fail to capture Davidson’s
resilience in the face of adversity. The Wildcats went into half-
time down 10 points after shooting a miserable 20% from the
field. Furthermore, four out of five starters fouled out by the end
of the game. Despite these obstacles, the team clawed its way
back. Down only 68-65 with 40 seconds left in the second half,
Paquette and Robinson both hit clutch jump shots to extend the
game to bonus basketball.

; pasketball scores two key victories

Despite the early foul trouble and being double-teamed for the
majority of the night, the sophomore guard still scored 12 points
and added eight rebounds as he extended his streak of double-
digit scoring efforts to 54 games.

Davidson continued to stymie the Eagles on defense and
cruised the rest of the second half on their way to securing the
60-47 victory. The Wildcats were able to survive a poor 36%
shooting night with an inspired defensive effort led by Max
Paulhus-Gosselin ’09, who led the ’Cats with three steals and
was particularly effective on Winthrop’s inbounds plays, forcing
five turnovers. Andrew Lovedale ’09 had another solid effort
contributing nine points and leading the team with 10 rebounds.

The Wildcats are undefeated since inserting Lovedale into the
starting line-up on Jan. 3 and with No. 2 Memphis’ loss to
Tennessee this weekend, Davidson now owns the longest win-
ning streak in the country at 17 games. The ’Cats will look to
extend their 28-game regular season Southern Conference win-
ning streak as they finish up conference play this week.

Tonight the Wildcats take on North Division-leading
Appalachian State as they play their final home game. The ’Cats
are riding a 16-game home winning streak and have won 40 of
their last 42 against SoCon opponents in Belk Arena. The home
finale is also “Senior Night” at Davidson as the senior tri-cap-
tains Richards, Boris Meno ’08 and Thomas Sander ’08 will be
honored before the game.

The Wildcats finish up their regular season Saturday at
Georgia Southern before heading to Charleston, S.C. for the
Southern Conference Tournament to be played March 7-10.
Although the ’Cats sit just outside both the AP Top 25 and USA
Today/ESPN Poll, they will probably need to defend their tour-
nament title to secure a spot in the NCAA Tournament’s field of
65.

Comeback SoCon victory key for ’Cats

In overtime, the Wildcats again found themselves with a dis-
advantage, down 75-71. After three made free throws by Monica
Laune ’10 and Kelsey Cary ’11, the ball found its way to the cor-
ner where Thompson drained the decisive three-point bucket.
After an insurance lay-up from Kelly Gassie ’09, who tied her
personal record for rebounding with seven, and solid free throw
shooting, the game concluded with the Wildcats ahead 84-76.

Unfortunately, the Wildcats could not maintain their momen-
tum on the road against Furman.

Alex Thompson ’10 led the "Cats with 13 points. Paquette and
Danielle Hemerka ’08 also broke into double-digits. With 11
points against the Paladins, Hemerka moved into seventh place
on the all-time on scoring list with 1,083 points.

A 20-10 run over a nine-minute stretch allowed the Wildcats
to shrink the lead to one, 63-62 at the 2:11 mark. After two
Furman free throws, Hemerka brought the Wildcats back to
within two at 65-63 with a free throw at the 1:17 mark.
Unfortunately, Davidson could get no closer to the Paladins.
Furman hit five of their last seven free throw attempts to seal the
victory at 70-66.

Davidson travels Thursday to play Georgia Southern in its last
road game of the season.
