Base Hospital, Camp Jackson, S. C.
March 11, 1918.
Editor Davidsonian:

Your recent request thar those of us
in service give you some idea of our ex-
periences in camp is cheerfully complied
with, but one is embarrassed by a ich-
ness of experiences and a censorship on
the recital of the same, so you will be
more or less disappointed in this note
which must deal with personals mostly.
] have been stationed at this hospital
since September t and have counted my-
self fortunate, for a camp could not be
better situated, since we are on a high
dry sandy ridge seven miles from Co
lumbia. We have had:no mud, though
the winter was hard even here, and at
tirst we did not have the heating plant
in good shape, for the buildings went up
so rapidly that the plumbers could not
keep up with the carpenters. We have
now 1,000 beds, and an additional 1,800
being built, and we have at present 110
nurses, 500 enlisted men and about 75
surgeons, so you may be assured that the
patients are well cared for in every way.
In fact there has never been a time when

-men were so well cared for as in this
mobilization. We have everything you

baths, plenty of amusements and sports,
all of which sounds as if | was writing
an ad. for a summer resort. It is all for
the business of war and things are stir-
ring at daylight every: morning. and as
I write I can hear the rattle of machine
gun fire and also the artillery thunder-
ing on the range.

I have a well-equipped ear. nose and
throat service and my building is as well
furnished as any private hospital and
there is plenty of work to do. ‘The old
Davidson days would he as a_kinder-
garten compared to the surgical work I
do here, but my associates are of the
finest and the work moves smoothly. I
see a great many old Davidson men and
have operated on quite a number of them
from time to time. I can give no infor-
mation in regard to the same. Ed Cur-
rie and W. W. Morton are around often
