ROTC Announces
Course Changes

Lt. Col. W. A. Adams, Jr.
announced this week that there
may be some changes in the
ROTC. course when students en-
roll for the fall term next year.

The two main changes that
would affect our present pro-
gram are, 1) the removal of
weapons instructions, such as
study of the crew-served weap-
ons, and 2) the reduction of
drill from two hours a week to
one hour.

_ To replace the hours lost in
these changes there would be
an increase in academic work in

the .classrooni. and possibly al.

requirement for certain aca-
demic courses. ,However, Col.
Adams revealed that about 99%.
of the advanced military stu-|
dents are already taking the
subjects that’ would be requir-
ed.
Col. Adams concluded, “Right |
now these changes are only
recommendations to the curri-
culum committee. The final de-
cision is up to them, and from
all indications, they will make
the changes effective next
year,”

interview Monday night.

“It will be the duty of. the

violations to the Interfraternity

pose fines upon those fraterni-

Council Conducts Poll:

Debates Own Suicide

By KNOX ABERNETHY

Last Monday night the Student Council met to revise the order of clections, to
conduct an accurate opinion poll on integration, and to discuss several other issues,
including the abolishment of the Student Council.

Elections will be run in five
groups this year, in the follow-
ing order: 1) Student Govern-
ment, 2) Honor Court, 3)
Y.M.C.A. and publications, 4)
Freshman adviser, 5) Class offi-
cers and Student Council repre-
sentatives. In the fifth group,
Student Council representatives
will be elected from each class,
and the representative receiv-
ing the most votes will be the
class president.

It was suggested that the
Student Council keep a bul-
letin board during elections.
On this bulletin board would
be posted pictures and infor-
mation on all the candidates.
Councilman Bob Avinger sug-
gested that the Council spon-
sor an open forum on the
opinions of each of the per-
sons running for office.

Council members Avinger and
Hudgins spearheaded a discus-
sion on whether or not to abol-
ish the Student Council. Avin-
ger suggested that, since there
is little or nothing for the Coun-
cil to do, representatives not be
elected for next year. He pro-
posed that the class officers

ns Renk: Equality,

Liberty And Fraternities

By HANS RENK

Coming from the very liberal and individualistic system of a European urban
University to a small, self-sufficiént College in the South of the United States is
quite a change, you will agree. But eight students from seven countries have taken
that step this year, trading many of the obvious advantages of their educational
systems for the bigger advantage of spending one year in the United States.

In order that the foreign stu-
dent can get most out of this
year, the program provides al-
most complete equality with the
Davidson student as far as
classes are concerned. The stat-
us of special student and ex-
emption from ROTC are the
only privileges. We accept all
this as a matter of course,
though many regulations must
seem absurd to students from
abroad, used to complete free-
dom in his studies.

Another, probably the big-
gest, difference between the |
two sysiems is that the stu-
dent in America lives on cam-
pus all the time, unlike his
European counterpart. For
this reason, the question of
equality does not stop on
the academic side.

It continues into all that is
known as the “Davidson way of
life”, especially the social life.
And this in Davidson means:

gram has provided for each
foreign student to be the guest
of a fraternity. How does that
work out in practice?

Naturally, a fraternity re-
quires a great amount of con-
formity. Even some American
students find it difficult to con-
form to this degree. It is fot
surprising that a foreign stu-
dent, with his different cultural,
educational, and social back-
ground should find conformity
harder than others. Although
not specifically required, he
feels somehow obliged to at-
tempt this. But is this the idea
of the program?

The official statement of
the Richardson Foundation,
the sponsor of the program,
lists as its main purposes:
“490 ~promote international
understanding ... “ and “to
broaden the horizons of the
Davidson Campus”.

Most of us find that the fra-

dents, tend to limit one’s ac-
quaintances to within the fra-
ternity. The amount of contact

depends to a large extent on the
individual fraternity. In a fra-
ternity with a strictly regional
outlook, for instance, a student
from a different country will
find less interest in himself as
a represenjative of foreign
ideas and culture,

In any case, the student
gets attention as a curiosity,
rather than genuine interest
for his own sake. This is
something perfectly natural.
The foreign student, on one
hand, has his strange “for-
eign ideas”, and on the other
hand, the Davidson student is
influenced by the ideas of his
traditional Southern society.
Can these two ever communi-
cate on a more significant level
than the arrangement of dates
and going up the road? The
“promotion of international un-

Fraternities. In anticipation of ternities, instead of promoting derstanding” means more than
this fact, the scholarship pro-,contacts with Americaan stu- this.

Question: Though the 1FC
has made specific rulings
against particular pre-initia-
tion activities such as the use
of brick or rock sacks, what
is to prevent fraternities from
getting around the rule by
making their pledges carry
books .instead of rocks in
sacks? How would this be
breaking a regulation?

Answer: Though

would say that it is a distastefu

practice, ana therefore, a vio-

jations.
Question: Where are you
going to draw the line be-
tween calisthenics and exces-

Question: To your know-
ledgo havo there been any
violations of the pre-initiation
regulations this year?

Answer: There were two vio-

lations prior to the release of
the regulations,. but the guilty
fraternitics will not be fined as
they did not know the regula-
tions, The IFC intends, though,
to talk to the officers of the
guilty fraternities.

Question: Has the 1FC made
any additional attempts,
other than the pre-initiation
regulations, to prevent this
year’s Greek Week from be-
coming anothor “Hell Week”?

—the fraternity system.

Goodykoontz invited Dave
Warden, viho has recently gone
inactive in his fraternity, to dis-
cuss at his Monday and Tues-
day classes the current fratern-
ity situation. As LFC president
Ward McKeithen was asked to
present his views on Wednes-
day.and Thursday.

DEVOTES CLASS TIME

Professor Goodykoontz ex-
plained that he was devoting
class time to the fraternity
question because he has fotind
that the academic performance
of the freshmen has fallen
sharply since they have started
eating at the fraternity houses
at the beginning of this semes-
ter.

“Freshmen performance has
taken this nose dive because of
the increased amount of time
they have to spend on the fra-
ternity,” he claims. “It seems
quite evident to me that the
fraternities are interfering
‘with the recognized goals of an

to the criticism the recent in-
actives have to offer, and I am
pleased with the strength they
have given the independents.”

The IFC voted in its fast
meeting to have the indepen-
dents elect a non-voting repre-
sentative to the council; the
presence of an independent on
the council will improve the
channel of communication ‘bo-
tween the independents and fra-
ternity members.

Question: Do you think the
fraternity system is in good
health?

Answer: Yes.

Question: Do you think
there are any signs of weak.
ness within the fraternity
system?

Answer: I don’t think the fra-
ternities have been living up
to their ritual, but 1 do believe
the fraternity organizations
are well worthy of their exis-
tence.

Qustion: There have been
complaints that the quality of
freshman work drops at the
beginning of second semester
when the freshman pledges
become more closely connect-
ed with the fraternities. Do
you feel that this is the fault
of the fraternities?

Answer: I wouldn't say that
it is the fault of the fraternities
for it is natural for everyone to
ease un at the beginning’ of the
semestcr. Also, fraternities do.
not emphasize grades as much
to the piedyes who have made
their grades, therefore the
quality of work. naturally drops

Warden procceded to list five
things which he thought were
indicative of Davidson's illness.

(1) There is a general lack
of spirit in sports, drama, de-

activity.

(2) The majority of seniors
are anxiously looking forward
to leaving the school after grad-
uation. Many say that they will
be glad to get out of this school
and that they are promptly go-
ing to forget about it.

(3) Freshmen come to David-
son with ability and motivation
to do a big job. Generally, first
semester motivation falls off.
This situation Warden attri-
butes to fraternity associations
