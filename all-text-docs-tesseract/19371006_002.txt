in our midst to conduet the annual Fait

finally a minister of the gospel. Dr. Barn-

been causing us to take spiritual inventory

At Football Games...

Re-it said to the great honor of the name.
oi Davidson College and to the eredit of its
controlling authorities, the public may be as-
sured of one thing when it attends foochall
games on Kichardson Ficid.

Jt will not see aeres of drunken spectators
lying out on the edges of the woods. nor,
for that matter, will the publie see ednspic-
nous evidences even of moderate. drinking.

Compulsory Chapel .. .:

A recent plea for voluntary chapel attend-
ance voiced in “The Johnsonian,” Winthrop
College news organ, made us cast a reilec-
tion or two in the direction of our chapel
period.

A Davidson College senior said, “1 be-
lieve our chapel is in reality the spirit of the

‘ school.” Although that may be a rather
broad statement, there seems to be a great
deal of truth in it. We may gripe about this
and argue about that, but, whether we real-
ize it or not, we have something in our daily
chapel period.

In the first place. the tiZteen minute in-
termission from classes is a welcome break
in the routine of study. The short service

This fool habit has apparentiy just about
been stopped by the authorities of the in-

stitution who for the past few years have -:

requested Spectators through a public ad-
dress system to desist trom drinking while
in the stadium.

Tits announeement of request and state-
ment of policy on the part of the Davidson
administration coming just prior to the
kick-off in games in its stadium has appar-
ently worked to the end for which it was
intended.

Drinking ax icooiball games, moderate or
exeessive, is to be deplored and denounced
and destroyed to whatever extent is possible.

There are always a vast majority of people
attending these events who disapprove of all
drinking and who especially dislike to be
hanrassed cither by the tomioolery of stim-
ulated Smart-Alecks and who, above, all
things else, are irequently enraged and out-
raged alike by those who have iorgetten to
count the number of times they have hit
the boitle. --

Out of decent respeet for the majority .of-
decent people, the authorities of all institu-
tions promoting these events should go to
every possible limit to discourage the use of |
intoxicants at football games.

It would in no sense be out of place for
these executives of cdllege and university
generally in North Carolina fe follow the
good example of those at Davidson whose
very friendly, courteous and gentlemanly
approach to this issue appears to have
brought its harvest of victory against these
common vulgarities.

It has always been a mystery to us, any-
way, that anybody should goto see a foot-
ball game and then get so blindly drunk
that they couldn’t see the Empire State
Building if it was standing on their toes.

every student. In the announcements and

Davidson spirit.

Maybe we do not always enter into the
spirit ot chapel as we ought. Perhaps we
tail to get the inl benciit of such a service.

“Let's think a little about it.

Let other institutions do away with their
compulsory chapel if taey can, but it should-
n't be any burden to us. On the other hand,
we ought to try to get the utmost irom it.

Taxes on Sports Events... _

A new dedjinition of football has
peared.

Iris 2 “function essential to governmental
iunctioning”’ and appears in the protest of a
number of colleges against the federal ac-
mission taxes on sports events.

The colleges contend that by this detini-
tion, the 10 per cent tax is uneonstitutional.

With the football season already upon him
Seeretary oi the Treastry Morgenthau is
preparing to take the issue to the Supreme
Court.

One out of every three boys and girls who

With The Staff |

We are oonvineed that every true foot-
ball fan who was iortunate enough to sce
the Wildcats serap the Blue Devils fast Sat-
urday went home with thoughts of Teeny
Lafferty and the nerve-racking goal line de-
fense of the “Cats.

There was one morose individual on
Richardson Field, however, who had pre-
viously deseribed Teeny’s three touchdown
exhibition in the Erskine game with yawns
and impatient sighs throughout his story
(which was a sporting news feature, not a
‘column). It is evident that she still chose
not to be impressed with last Saturday's
brilliant showing. .

Maybe this “second ‘Johnny Branch’ who
failed to, mature at U. N. C.” has memories
that dull his enthusiasm for other stars
when he looks over the gridiron here at
Davidson. At least no one could have writ-
ten a more unemotional account of what
appeared to 99 44-100% of the spectators
and opposing players io be talent of All-
American Calibre. 1t ts not good to play
up a person too much, but it is disturbing to
sec one not get the credit he so justly de-
serves.

Speaking of deserving causes ... Would
it not be fine if something could be done to
make a week-end on the campus more en-
joyable? At present there is very little in-
centive to remain on the campus when our
teams are on the road—except doubled cuts
and bad weather which are inevitable. An
enlarged recreation center has been the an-
swer for many years and is still years down
the list on the cdéntennial building program.
Yes, Davidson is growing and daily becom-
ing a bigger and better institution but may
it be a symmetrical, well rounded growth.

This year’s frosh class seems to have got-
ten off to a fancy start, but their high I. Q.
does not excuse the intolerable acts as they
have now found. The time is passing and
they should soon grasp that “old feeling”
which prompts in one the spontaneous greet-
ing of one man to another, the desire to
bobst Davidson wherever he may be, and
the sense of reality in being an integral part
of the widely known DAVIDSON SPIRIT.
