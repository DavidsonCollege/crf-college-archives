ball coach and instructor in
physical education; and Joseph
Conarroe, instructor in English.

ly students sincerely interested;

in student affairs would parti-
cipate, and that poor records
of incumbents would be brought
to light, thus eliminating dead-
wood or scaring it into work-
ing during its term.

The objections were that it
would create more hard feel-
ings than interest, that the pres-
ent policy put very good men
into office, and that public
speakers rather than good boys
would be elected.

Campaigning would bring out
into the open some of the sub-
tle popularity-building which is
practiced at present, but the
fear was expressed that it would
increase the competition in all
forms.

If any compromise form of
campaigning were allowed, it
would perhaps work best to
have merely debates or speech-
es by the candidates, under su-
pervision of the Elections
Board.

NO POSTERS, SLOGANS

Having no posters or slogans
or fraternity pressure would
perhaps lessen the commercial-
ism and underhanded dealings

lation which was offered by the
Peden amendment.

The committee was split as
to the value of these proposals,
and voted to refer them to the
entire council for discussion at
the next meeting.

sidered opinion of the matter

Davigison College faces a

On the other hand, we must

that his proposal will effective-
