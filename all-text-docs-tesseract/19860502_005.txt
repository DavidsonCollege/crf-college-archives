Friday, May 2, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Students build another shanty for protests

By HEIDI HOOKER

The Students Against Apar-
theid group led by freshmen
Kevin Dunn, Jay Barron, Greg
Busby, and Michael Schull have
continued their protest of the col-
lege’s South African investments
and the 1979 “Statement of
Davidson Trustee Endowment In-
vestment Policy” by constructing
four shanties on the lawn in front
of the Union.

The Students Against Apar-
theid group met Wednesday night
and decided to construct the new
shanties in demonstration to the
Trustees (visiting this weekend
for a board meeting) their desire
for revision of the seven-year-old
policy for South African invest-
ments. In this demonstration, con-
cerned students of the organiza-
tion have kept the shanties oc-
cupied all day while six students

even slept with them Wednesday
night.

Dunn commented that he is
annoyed by the students’ apathy in
general on this issue and hopes to
promote student awareness of the
controversy and what he perceives
to be “blatant hypocrisy” in the
school’s investment principles. In
the near future, Dunn hopes to ob-
tain an open hearing on campus
for students in front of the Trustee
Committee that will be responsi-
ble for reevaluating the policy and
reporting back to the general Trus-
tee Board by Oct. 1, 1986 for their
next meeting.

Dunn wrote an open letter to
the Board of Trustees, which is
posted at various major locations
on campus, expressing the stu-
dents’ desire for reassessment of
the policy. Only part of the or-
ganized Students Against Apar-

theid, including Dunn, are pursu-
ing divestment, but Dunn asserts
that the reassessment of the policy
is the first step for the general Stu-
dents Against Apartheid move-
ment.

Dunn points out that the
hypocrisy of the investment pol-
icy lies in its statement that ‘the
college’s investments should not
be made in securities or corpora-
tions or in other assets which are
used in ways which contradict or
violate the Christian commitment
of the college.” Dunn believes the
policy on investment does “con-
tradict and violate” the College’s
Christian commitment as well as
the “morals of the Trustees.”

The degree of investment in-
cluded in the policy is that “there
is certainly agreement. . . that
the South African government is
in violation of human rights as we

Sophomore Fudd McKinney and freshman Jay Barron

in America perceive these rights,
and also in violation of Christian
principles. But, so are the govern-
ments of many other major coun-
tries throughout the world.”
Dunn attacks the “false moral-

ity” of the Trustees and endorses
the request of the Executive Com-
mittee of the Faculty for the Board
of Trustees to renew the policy in
respect to Davidson's South Afri-
can investments.

Solidarity Celebration overshadows Klan march

By HEIDI HOOKER

Through the joint efforts and
organization of the Student Gov-
ermment Association and the
Union Board, a solidarity celebra-
tion was held behind the Vail
Commons on Saturday afternoon
from 1-4 p.m. while the Ku Klux
Klan marched on Main Street that
afternoon.

Student leaders stressed that
they organized the solidarity rally

as a response to the Klan’s march,
not a protest. Student Government
Association President Mark
Sandy originated the idea of the
celebration and commented, “We
decided we wanted to respond ina
positive way, not to have an anti-
Klan rally, but rather to have a
Solidarity Day as a positive ap-
proach.”

Funded by the SGA and the
Union Board, the Solidarity fes-
tivities provided entertain>ent
featuring folk singing by Ton.
Jennings, junior Bobby Houck,
and other students, and providing
free refreshments and helium-
filled balloons. Activities in-
cluded frisbee, volleyball, and
table tennis games. Approxi-
mately 500 people attended the
celebration.

The Klan marched on Main
Street from Town Hall to Griffith
Road between 2 and 3 p.m. ina
group of about 37 men, women
and children. Hank McKerman on
the Davidson police force com-
mented that the streets were “al-
most barren” and affirmed that the

college’s celebration was “instru-
mental in our not having a prob-
lem.”

Campus Police Officer Rick
Moore commented that there
seemed to be “more police offi-
cers than spectators at the march.”
While town police, the state high-
way patrol and the State Bureau of
Investigation patrolled Main
Street in uniform, campus police
were asked to stay on campus and

attend the solidarity festivities.

Despite the efforts of student
leaders, ten to 15 did attend the
Klan march. Senior Pat Millen ex-
pressed his disappointment shared
by other leaders that their goal of
100 percent solidarity was not
achieved but did explain that the
celebration was a “tremendous
success” overall. Millen felt that
the plan for the day was “well-
conceived from the beginning and
went forth so easily.”

Student leaders achieved a
two-fold purpose in the Solidarity
Day event. SGA Vice President
Vincent Knight explained that
though the celebration was signif-
icant in revealing the Davidson
community’s lack of interest in
the Klan’s statement by creating a
“ghost town” on Main Street, he
asserted the interest of the SGA
and Union “to unite the communi-
ty and the campus to learn more
about each other.” The making of
name buttons at the celebration
was to help identify people and in-
troduce them around.

Knight anticipates that the

SGA and the Union will hold this
Solidarity Day annually in the fall
as a means of orienting the stu-
dents to their surrounding com-
munity. Former Union President
Rob Vaughn commented that he
“hopes to establish the issue of
solidarity at Davidson in the foref-
ront of people’s minds.”

College President John
Kuykendall expressed his ap-
preciation of this student-or-
ganized effort to unite the students
with their community of profes-
sors, administrators, and town
folks explaining, “This is the
creativity of Davidson students at
their very best. . . It expresses a
lot of positive sentiments and
avoids the kind of negativity you
might expect in a small town ona
day like this.”

Kuykendall in his letter to the
student body expressed that the
Klan march was a “significant oc-

5 casion for the testing of our col-
8 lege community ... It) would
t have been an easy thing to give

their (the Klan’s) message an un-
warranted measure of publicity by
giving public expression to per-
sonal curiosity or animosity. It
was to the great credit of you as
Davidson students that our re-
sponse was set forth in much more
creative terms.

“T have had many occasions to
be gratified by the wisdom and
character of the members of this
student body. The Solidarity Cel-
ebration .. . was expressive of

the very best of those attributes.”

Freshman Harry Broome, Jr.
began the effort which resulted in
the Solidarity Day. He was one of
the first students to pursue a
means of student response to the
Klan. He and freshmen David
Rochford and Todd Young drew
up fliers concerning the Klan’s
march which were distributed
around the campus Tuesday night
a week ago.

Broome had originally desired
that these fliers let everybody
know about the march and an-
nounce a general meeting for all
concerned students in front of
Belk dormitory on Thursday after-
Broome commented that
their initial intentions in accord
with the anger and disgust aroused
by the anticipated Klan march
were to organize an anti-Klan
rally. The three freshmen re-
searched effective means of re
sponse by contacting the David-
son town council, the Chief of
Police, the area’s NAACP, and fi-
nally SGA President Mark Sandy.

Wednesday afternoon Sandy,
Assistant Chaplain and communi-
ty leader Brenda Tapia, BSC pres-
ident junior Rob Ellison, Millen,
senior Horace Manor and senior
Rob Vaughn discussed — pos-
sibilities for a student reaction to

noon.

the Klan and came up with the
idea for the Solidarity Day cele-
bration.

Sandy and Vaughn proposed
the idea of Solidarity Day at the

meeting set up by Broome. About
100 students attended the meet-
ing, and Sandy commented that he
was very impressed that despite
the variety of opinions and differ-
ences conceming student re-
sponse to the Klan, the students
were able to compromise their
reactions to establish one response
and act as a united student body.
Sandy had originally hoped that
whatever they decided to do, the
students would act as a unified
community.

Students did agree on the Sol-
idarity Day idea and Sandy, Vau-
ghn and Knight began organized
the event Thursday night.

Under Knight's leadership,
about 1000 leaflets were distri
buted Friday afternoon through
out the community, inviting mem
bers to join the solidarity celebra
tion. Knight was able to recruit
about 100 students to help with the
“leg work” and was impressed
with the student concern

In addition, Knight had the

town merchants contacted and

asked to shut down business that
afternoon to assist with the at
tempt to make Davidson's Main
Street a “Ghost Town.” Busines-
ses like the M&M Soda Shop did
in fact comply with the request.
Knight felt that the Klan

march had no ill effect at all on the
success of minority weekend eve-
nts but instead revealed an impres-
sive unity between campus and
community .
