THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 20, 1927

Fraternity Men Looking
Forward to Initiations

Approximately Eighty Men to be
‘aken in

A few weeks after the mid-year ex-
ams the various fraternities on the Hill
will initiate their pledges into full mem-
bership in the fraternities. This year,
the fraternities pledged 64 men on bid
day, and since that time they have ad-

ded at least 15 men to this list. The!

pledges, in order to be initiated are re-
quired to pass at least three major sub-
jects.
this requirement will be required to pass
three majors during the second semester
in order to be initiated.

The initiations this year will be held

a few days earlier than last year, the!

initiations last year having been held
about the middle of February.

The pledges have had it forcibly im-
pressed upon them that they will be very

melancholy during and immediately fol-,
lowing the initiations. Thus the report!
that the freshmen are looking forward |

to the initiations with a great deal of
pleasure, can hardly’ be verified.

Don’t knock the school or its compo-
nent parts. You may be wrong. If you
don’t boost Davidson, people interested
in the institution will look at you askance
and wonder what manner of place this

might be. Talk enthusiastically. People}

will continue to wonder, but for a dif-
ferent cause.

Alumni Secretary Visits Plans for New Athletic —

Conference Formulated

Professor W. W. Wood Elected
Head of Committee on
Organization

Prof. W. W. Wood, graduate manager
of athletics at Davidson, was elected
chairman of a committee to foster the or-
ganization of a new athletic conference,
at a meeting of athletic officials in
Charlotte last Friday, January 14th. Act-

ference to include many colleges in the |
Mid-Atlantic states, the Charlotte Cham-
ber of Commerce has taken the initiative
in calling together the coaches, and ath-|
letic officials, of this ‘district to take defi-
nite steps toward organizing an athletic)
conference that will be known as the
Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Confer-
ence.

Davidson College will probably enter
this conference, if plans for organization
mature.

“T think it would be a very good thing,”
said Prof. Wood, “and T would like to see
Davidson allied with other teams in the|
proposed conference. If it is limited to
include schools within an area that would
not be too large, I believe the Athletic
Council, composed of alumni and athletic
officials here, would sanction the en-
tranee of Davidson College into such an
organization,”

Coach Monk Younger is heartily in
favor of the new conference and favors
our entrance,

Since ‘acgreat many colleges feel that!
they are isolated because they do not be-|

of numerous teams of this section,

When this measure is brought up be-
fore the student body, it will very likely |
be passed, since from personal expres- |
sion, it has met with approval from |

|

many students.
At a meeting at Jacksonville, the first}
week in December, an athletic confer- |
ence was proposed and discussed.. No|
definite steps toward its formation were |
taken, however, antil the recent meet- |
ing in Charlotte. |
The number of colleges admitted will
be limited to 12 or 15. Among those con. |
sidered for membership are William and |
Mary and the University of Virginia, in|
Virginia; Duke University, Wake For- |
est and in North Carolina; |
Furman, Presbyterian College and Cita- |
del, in South Carolina; and Oglethorpe |

Student Council Moves

Into Office in Oak Row

Council Obtains Old Beta Hall for
\ Much Needed Office
The south end of Oak Row is the new
home of the Student Council. All meet-
ings of this prominent campus organiza- |
tion will be held there from now on.
Since the founding of the honor. system |

land the Student Council, as the official |

head of this system, the latter have been
forced to meet in the various Literary
Society halls, but since these halls did
not belong to the council they could not
be regarded as a permanent meeting |
place.

This new arrangement makes it!
very convenient for the Student Coun- |
cil for they now have what may be call-}
ed a.regular meeting place.

Since the social fraternities moved off |

the campus two years ago, the rooms in
Oak and Elm rows have been vacant |
until this year. During this year, how- |
ever, several organizations have made |
their offices in these rooms. The office |
of the Alumni Association, of; the “D" |
Club and the Student Council are now in|

these buildings. Before the fraternities | .,

used these buildings as halls they served |
as dormitories. |

The first official act of the Student
Council was to swear in the new presi-
dent of the Class of ’30, Allan Frew, who
with his election automatically became
a member of this organization.

The work “Dixie” originated from a bank-
note given out by a New Orleans bank in
early days. These notes wre printed in
French and English, and bore the French
word for ten, Dix. They became known as
“Dixies,” and the South as Dixieland.
