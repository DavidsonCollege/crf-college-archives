FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1965

Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect. the views of the editor.)

Bye-Bye, Paternalism

Several weeks ago we commended
the faculty action on the drinking
rule, which evidenced increased con-
fidence among the professors in the
maturity and responsibility of the
Davidson student body.

This confidence was not misplaced.

We are now concerned about the
current discussion over the new reg-
ulation and about the possibility that
the new rule may be repealed.

Such a rescission would certainly
be a step backward in the progres-
sive movement which is carrying
Davidson toward the position of a
truly superior institution among the
nation’s liberal arts schools.

Such a progressive attitude was,
of course, most recently manifested
in the abolishment of the antiquated
faculty oath.

That a college which intends to
produce responsible men possessing
sound judgment and high social ma-
turity should not retain. an extremely
paternalistic regulation which would
prohibit students’ freedom of choice
away from Davidson seems to require
no further explanation.

Last month’s faculty action exem-
plifies such intentions on the part of
the school.

Some further points may be con-
sidered before any future decisions
are reached. .

The freedom granted to the Social
Council to schedule off-campus affairs
is advantageous for obvious reasons.

The Strategic Line

We harbor a certain distaste for
clarifying the biased remarks of Bill
Trotter in his letter to the editor
this week, for the letter itself part-
ly exemplifies the very “rash and
foolish” comments of which we spoke
several weeks ago.

Such misleading and misinformed
observations by Trotter lead directly
to the confused conversations which
temper this campus so often.

We -have said before and wil] con-
tinue to claim that honest and sincere
criticism is a healthy part of any
academic community. But we sim-
ply have no patiénce with those who
would take advantage of the forum
of this newspaper to air their slug-
gish and confused feelings.

In the first instance, many stu-
dents failed to inform themselves of
the published trial procedure ({i.e.,
Wildeat Handbook, pp. 46-47) of the
Honor Court and jumped instead to
hasty conclusions about the recent
trial. What could be more imprudent
than complete ignorance of such per-
tinent details?

When the fact became known that
the student who was dismissed had ad-
mitted his guilt. several days after
the trial, many persons remained si-
lent concerning this “new develop-
ment” about which Trotter writes
and chose instead to watch the cam-
pus rumors perpetrate even more
viciously.

What is more, we did not call for
an end to all student criticism, by
any means. Instead, we ended the
specific editorial with an admonition
for all students to present their state-
ments and opinions through the prop-
er avenues of expression. _

Therefore, it is encouraging that
Trotter would use this forum to ex-
press his opinions to the college audi-
ence.

Perhaps it is “high time” that the
Honor Court comes in for some ser-
ious criticism, as he suggests.

But what misinformation it is to
imply that the court had anything
to do with the three cases cited. Only
one of the cases — the first —. was
brought before the Honor Court, the
other cases were not even tried by the
court.

Finally, we would point out that
our terms “rash and foolish” were
clearly applied to the statements, and
not to the students themselves.

The fact that nearly every U. S.

The recognition of drinking at some
Social Council functions will certainly
lessen the strangle-hold which frater-
nities still retain. over social life at
Davidson—a point which should be
more evident as freshmen pledge fra-
ternities next semester. .

The number of students attending
Social Council functions which conflict
with fraternity parties should be dras-
tically reduced next semester. ;

The matter of athletic trips is a
problem that should be handled by the
discipline of the individual coaches
rather than by a general college rule
pertaining to all students.

It is a poor commentary on the
authority of the coaching staff when
they lack so much the confidence of
the members of their teams. |

Perhaps the wisest decision that
could be reached at the faculty meet-
ing next week is for a study group to
be appointed to examine the implica-
tions of the present rule which ‘were
not brought out before the regula-
tion was approved last month. |

Such a body could work directly
or in an advisory capacity with the
joint faculty trustee committee which
has been given the responsibility of
studying the existing regulation.

We are confident that the faculty
will retain its progressive momentum
and not lapse further into this pater-
nalism. which is slowly—but ever
so surely—becoming a thirig of the
past.

daily newspaper devoted a lead edi-
torial recently to the anti-Vietnam
demonstrations by students is evi-
dence :to us of some concern by stu-
dents here, and Trotter has evidenced
that fact.

We never intended to hide the fact
that the opinions were not our own
but hoped instead by such a sam-
pling of editorial comments to stimu-
late some statements from the David-
son student on the demonstrations.

But, alas, Trotter is the only one so
far to fulfill our expectations.

Concerning the current demonstra-
tions of student concern all across
the country, we were interested to
read reports of the move afoot at the
University of California at Los Angeles
to close the obviously growing gap in
communication between college stu-
dents and administrators on the na-
tion's campuses.

Nearly all of the various activist
movements which are present on
UCLA’s sister campus at Berkeley can
be counted on the sprawling grounds
in Los Angeles. Yet, the absence of
a crisis atmosphere at UCLA is ob-
vious.

Also obvious is the reason for that
difference—the invisible but strategic
line of communication between stu-
dent and administration which is fos-
tered and always open at UCLA.

Similar to Davidson’s student-fac-
ulty conference committee, a group
composed of three students — the
heads of the graduate and undergrad-
uate schools and the newspaper editor
at UCLA—and three administrators
meet once a month to discuss the
problems of a school with 26 times
the enrollment of Davidson.

“We feel that the only way to deal
with this generation of students is to
talk with them. I won't talk with
an ad hoc group, but I will talk with
any legitimate group of its students.
any time. whatever, thelr mission,”
observed the UCLA chancellor, Dr.
Frank D. Murphy.

We believe that the administration
at Davidson shares such an attitude.

With demands and pressures on
students and college officials alike, it
may be easv for such unilateral state-
ments as Trotter’s to blurt out. In-
creasing'y it seems, progressive
changes can only be made through
a growing confidence shared by both
groups on campus.

THE EDITOR

Trotter Blasts Editor's Honor Court Stand

Dear Editor:

I arrived 6n campus about
midnight of the 26th and found
a message for me from the edi-
tors of this paper. I had several
days earlier given vent to con-
siderable spleen by writing as
vicious a letter as I could at-
tacking the whole reactionary
spread on the editorial page of
the next-to-last issue of THE
DAVIDSONIAN, especially the
pronouncements on the criti
cisms of'the Honor Court.

A new development in the
case around which this criticism
had generated, rendered por-
tions of my letter invalid and
‘the editors very decenfly. swarn-
ed me in time for me to either
tevise or retract it.

A- I had just finished driv-
ing 300 miles, had. slept five
hours in the past two and a half
days and had a tough review the
next morning. I was in no mood
to attemp: mucb of anything.
much less something as demand.
ing of calm thought as revision
of a letter. I tore the thing up.

That was a mistake. A re-
vision was necessary and the
main point of that first letter
is as Important as ever. Said
main point is this: That it {s
nothing short of outrageous for
the editors of this paper—a pa-
per which in the past has been
fairly courageous in its opposi-
tion to some of the things that
keep this campus in such a con-
stant state of intellectual con-
stipation—should condemn those
who criticized the Honor Court
as “rash and foolish.’

The most. embittered criticism
came not from the usual cam-
pus leftists, but from some usu-
ally quiet and solid students
whose reason. character and
‘academic achievement have
gained them wide respect on
this campus.

The student involved in this .

case was well-liked and admired
—those who. knew him, and those
who learned of some of the
inconsistencies and oh-so-strange
procedural aspects of the legal
function that “got” him were
upset and critical.

But can the editors honestly

say that placing a concern for *

simple human justice and the
entire future fate of a fellow
student above traditional ac-
quiesence to anything spoon-fed
us from The Top constitutes
a “rash and foolish’ action?
If enough people GOT concern-
ed, some of the crimes against
the human spirit which go on
here might be stopped.

at very least, have the guts and
energy to get up off their cans
and DO something in the name
of some cause bigger than them-
selves. No one around here ap-
parently does.

It doesn’t matter whether the

forty years or four hundred~
it’s high time it came in for
some serious criticism.

Dear Editor:

Much discussion has taken
place concerning how Davidson
will spend the money provided
by the recently announced Ford
Foundation challenge grant.

It seems to me that these dis-
cussions have not taken into ac-
count one of the most important
parts of the famous Davidson
College liberal education, name-
ly compulsory ROTC.

Most people seem to think that
the funds will be used for such
pedestrian matters as increasing
faculty salaries, adding to the
endowment, and releasing other
money for buying books and
perhaps, in the not-too-distant
future, building a more ade-
quate library.

What kind of talk is this? Are
we to infer that keeping a good
professor is more important
than expanding the military
science department? Are we to
infer that books for the library
are more important than tomes
for the ROTC reference room in

seat case, the spicy motel-bed-
Ttoom-case, and the somewhat
ludicrous *‘Red-Eye"’ case .
the whole dirty atmosphere sur-
rounding these and similar cases
should prove to anyone who
troubles to look, that Davidson's
system is set up to dispense jus-
tiee, but mainly to protect the
school’s bloated and fraudulent
public relations image. Any-
thing to keep that ol’ money
flowing in and those -occasion-
ally absurd DC Bulletins flow-
‘ing out. ...

The Honor Court is not alto.
gether to blame—it is hamstrung
bv a system which makes little
provision for mercy and the
exegencies of circumstance. But
the Honor Court has been guilty
o? Gestapo tactics in past years.

One remembers the student
who was physically taken by
‘two goons from the Court and
‘led across campus for question-
ing (one under each arm, in ap-
proved MP style): one remem-
bers the absolutely psychotic
way traps have been laid for
offenders. or in an attempt to
create offenders during a dull
season—money laid out on dress-
ers in plain sight, door left open,
spies gleefully waiting in the
closet to snag any culprit: one
remembers much more... .

I mean no slur on any Honor
Court member, past or’ present.
but let us admit that such an
office brings out those fester-
ing little streaks of megalo-
mania present inside all of us.

It is reported that John Cal-
vin, while watching preparations
for a mass burning-at-the-stake
of heretics, remarked ‘Use
green wood—that way they'll
have more time to repent.”

Dear Editor:

As an addendum to Mr. Gra-
ham's description of honor as
the death of a way of life:

Cheating is bad.

Why?

Because it is stealing.

How?

_ Because you are taking some-
thing. his thought, from, some-
one and using it for personal
gain.

Do we punish people because
they attemp: to attract atten-
tion or to be better than they
are?

Ne, but because they harm
the other person by unfairly ap-
pearing better than this other
from whom they have stolen.

How?

If the teacher grades on the
curve, the student who by cheat-
ing receives an unfairly good
grade raises the curve and
lowers the average grade. Well
(even if we knew that cheaters
always steal the correct infor-
mation), do we protect the re-
lative status of others by re-
moving the cheater?

No, not in the bad sense of the
word status. We rather allow
everyone to do his honest best
and to receive his honest due.

Being graded on the curve is
receiving one’s honest due?

When we leave the university,
the only way people will know
what we have done is by looking
at our grades and how they
stand in relation to the grades
of others.

Are these grades reliable?
There are many different col-
leges.

One must know the reputation
of the particular school; then
the grades from that school will
mean something.

What? There are many pro-
fessors.

“Grades are an indication, a
general one, of how a student

Yet, I have faith in Davidson
College. They put first things
first. So long as the college re-
quires more semesters of ROTC
than of mathematics, science,
political science, history, music,
philosophy, sociology, economics
or psychology, I will have faith
that ROTC will be perpetuated
in its role as a pillar in the

Dear Editor:

SOCRATES: Sergeant. per-
haps by this time you have dis-
covered some reason for requir-
ing two years of ROTC at David-
son. Have you, or not?

SERGEANT: Yes, Socrates, I
have. Davidson requires two
years of the course in order to
fulfill the national prrpose.

SOCRATES: Since the stv-

dent who takes only two years
of the course enters the army
when, and if, he does, not as an
officer but as any other enlisted
man, how can his taking two
years of the course “‘fulfill the
hational purpose?” It seems to
me that two years of ROTC is a
waste not only for the student
but also for the army and the
government. Do you agree, or
not?

SERGEANT: Yes, Socrates
that does seem to me to be true.

SOCRATES: Besides, David-
son's purpose is to be a good
liberal arts college. Can't it al-
so “fulfill the national purpose”
by being a good college? Is
slaughter of other human beings
the only way to serve the na-
tion? Is it not true that there
are other ways of service to
one’s country?

SERGEANT: Yes, indeed,
Socrates, it does seem so to me.

stands in relation to his fellows.
Or of how much particular
kinds of work he has done?
Yes, but this work is the ac-
quisition of scholarly method and
therefore perhaps the most im-
portant thing a student can do.
So a student works, is ranked,
then sent to a job on the basis
of his ranking, and ranked
again. What do they learn?
How to live in the real world.
People need to be told where

‘they rank in the real world?

Yes.

Why?

They need prestige.

Why?

So they will work.

Wit

There's no point in working if
it's not recognized.

Is the only form of recogni-
tion the right to economie domi-
ance? Is éconamiec power the
only reason people have for
working?

But they want comfort. not
dominance: they work for a bet-
ter life, but there's only a little
of that to go around.

How, though. do many com-
fortable people react to the not-
so-comfortable? And you will
tell me next that, on the con-
trary, there is a great deal of
the better life in the United
States, so much that real worry
about the not so comfortable is
an exaggerated reaction to an

important. but minor problem.
You study, then, free from
cheaters, to get at the good life,
which by definition is available
to everyone, almost?

No, ranking is important in all
societies, and besides I study
because I want to learn.

Cheating is therefore bad be-
cause someone is ranked un-
fairly, that is, higher than you
perhaps, and because his cheat-
ing lowers the level of your
learning?

No, the cheater is hurting only
himself.

Then why do you expel him,
or talk in scolding or disparag-
ing tones about him?

To show him that he is harm-
ing himself.

You mean you are convincing
him of the importance of the
ranking system, respect of fear
of which drove him to cheat in
the first. place?

But we have to have -a-way-of- —

knowing what capabilities a per-
son possesses, and the grading
system is the only way we have.
Grade-ranking. however,
shows the capabilities and de- —
sires of the individual in rela-
tion to one particular system of
economic toil. You punish the
cheater because he threatens
your place in the system. Or so
it seems. Thihk it over.

Davidsonian Associate Editor

A BUNCH OF US GOT TO TALKING over a cup
of coffee the other night — the talk went from sex
and dance weekends to metaphysics and statues back
to alcohol and honor courts. About the only point
we held in common was that it was good to see some
more controversy and discussion going on the cam-
pas again. What’s below is some of our comments

as:

* * *

WONDER WHY IT IS that girls from Northern
schools (particularly from the “Seven Sisters”) make
for much more interesting dates than do most of the
girls from around here? It’s dangerous to generalize
on 2 topic like this but there is really quite a dif-

Northern girls (at least the ones we had known)
usually have the same good looks and sophistication
plus a lot more wit and much more interesting con-
versation. Not only do the Northern girls fill all the
requirements for a good date; but these girls know
who John Lindsay and Ernest Nagel are and they
want to tell you what they think about Viet Nam (or
ney, ne ethics are inseparable from their condi-

Maybe it’s because these Northern girls read a.
lot more, take their education more seriously, or
maybe it's because they’re more alive and more a
part of things than are most Southern girls, Those
Northern girls can find out pretty quickly whether
you know what you're talking about, but it’s really
great to talk with a date instead of talking over or
at her about dippy little things.

Southern girls are a little prettier though —
maybe it’s because they use less make-up.
* *

ONE BOY SAID that the whole mess over
whether or not to show “Flaming Creatures” in the
Union reminded him of the story about that sculptor
who made a statue of horse manure: After all the
awards and controversy and misunderstanding
galore, it was still a pile of horse manure. The flick,
he said, sounds much like the statue.

But it is interesting to note that some of the
so-called liberal element on campus are actually
asking for an official censorship committee to re-
place C. Shaw Smith’s rather liberal (and unofficial)
censorship of campus flicks. What a Pandora’s box
that would open!

Incidentally we noted on the Wailing Wall that
there are still some people (mostly frosh) who think
that big words from little men (“. . . shut your petty
traps . . .”) and sneering phrases (“. . . no one else
agrees with him .. “) pass for ideas.

*

THERE WAS A RUMOR that Davidson’s Honor
Court is drawing up a set of proposals to amend its
trial procedure and that these proposals are to be
presented to the Student Council Monday night.

Behind all the recent controversy over honor
courts and their procedures seems to be the realiza-
tion that neither justice nor love was being served
very well by the present Honor Court procedures.
This realization was long overdue. Here’s hoping
that these new proposals are more than just a white-
washing.

¢ 6 e

SOME OF THE FRESHMEN complained that
they were tired of the prep school attitudes around
the campus and particularly the prep school atmosp-
here around their parties. Their main complaint was
why couldn't they have parties off-campus and drink
along with the upperclassmen instead of having to
sneak down to the soccer field.

The connection between alcohol, the fraternity
system and Davidson’s super-cool provincialism may
be a lot closer than qnost people think.

*

ONE LAST COMPLAINT: The idea that to be
intellectual around here requires a beard-briefcase-
and shoulder-length hair is about as absurd as the
idea that students who dress neatly and play football
are all stupid (therefore inferior) animals.

That some pretty-boy fraternity men and un-
washed independents have these font notions is bad
enough, but now some of the profs are trying to out-
do them in this crude arrogance. More on this later.
