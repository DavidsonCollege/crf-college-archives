A BAND,

From appearances most of the college
8. A. ‘I. C.'s of the country have a band
or musical organization of some kind, if
nothing more than a fife and kettle
drum. Every camp or army post in the
country has its band. ‘Strains of martial
music may be heard on almost every one
of the larger ships in the Navy. David-
son is now an army post and Davidson
men are full-fledged soldiers of Uncle
Sam, under special training. Then why
can't we have a band to make more im-
pressive any ceremonies which it may be
necessary to observe, and to shake a little
pep out of the crowds at ‘the games
which will be played on the Hill? Sure-
ly out of the body of men gathered at
Davidson there are some who can rattle
a kettle drum, toot a trombone, beat 2
base drum, blow a bugle. or manipulate
some other instrument. There's nothing
like a band for killing monotony and
putting snap and life in a fellow. One
could be built up around our rival
buglers as a nucleus. How about it?

THE FORUM.

For the last two years The Davidson-
ian has been running a department called
The Forum, .in which any articles sub-
mitted by students or alumni containing
any ideas or suggestions.of value or deal-
ing with campus problems have been
printed. The conditions on the campus
this year are of course greatly changed
from those of the old college days, yet
even now constructive criticism and the
expression. of one's opinions would not be
out of place. Being under military au-
thority, stricter care must be taken as to
what we print, and of course a reason-
able degree of censorship is observed in
all articles, but that does not prevent the
expression of views concerning the activi-
ties of the student soldiers themselves.
This department will gladly welcome
any such articles and we hope that The
Forum will prove a success.

“Discipline is the. desire, the eager,
earnest desire to obey all orders and to
see that they are properly carried out
regardless of consequence or danger.”

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, October 30, 1918

CIGARETTES AND BEDDING.

Almost every Tuesday and Thursday
afternoon when the bedding is brought
in from being sunned, some fellow finds
a round, charred hole in his sheet or
blanket and a burnt out cigarette or
cigar stub lying in the middle of it. A
cigarette carelessly thrown out of a
window on one of these days can’t help
but land on someone's bedding. It’s a
pity some fellow can't throw a cigarette
on his own blanket some day, so that
when he finds the remains, possibly he
will begin to have a little consideration
for others. It’s merely an act of thot-
lessness which should easily be controlled
with very little effort. Can't something
be done to stop it?

Let's turn out Saturday with some of
that old-time Davidson pep and make a
noise. Remember that the Wofford
squad will be visitors on the campus, and
let's cut out all personal talk. Show
that Davidson courtesy, but don’t fail to
let them know that our team has the sup-
port of every man on the Hill. Any
fellow who stays away from the game
without sufficient. reason, and hasn't
enough interest even to ask the score
when it is over, deserves to be run out of
town. Some say that Davidson can’t
yell; show them Saturday whether you
‘can or not. Coach and te team will do
it. Let them know the student body is
backing them.

WRITTEN 400 YEARS AGO.

Old Mother Shipton, an aged 16th
century witch of western England wrote
these jingling lines back in 1514—four
hundred years ago:

When Pictures look alive,
With movement free;
When Ships like fishes
Swim beneath the sea;
When men, outstripping birds
Do scorn the sky;
Then half the world.
Deep drenched in blood,
Shall die.

Some prophetess, wouldn't you say?

THE IDEAL SOLDIER.

The following cighteen characteristics
Wordsworth attributes to the ideal sol-
dier in his poem, the Happy. Warrior:
Generous, diligent to. learn, moral, self-
controlled, compassionate, controlled by
reason, honorable, faithful, likable, rises
to crisis, consistent in his laws of life in
battle and at peace, equal to the need, at
heart loving peace and home, plays a
square game, brave, optimistic, believing
heart and soul in his cause, faith in God:
“This is the hapy warrior; this is he
Whom every, man in arms should wish

to be.”

At last we don’t have to get up in the
morning and see the moon and stars
shining.

Those overseas addresses haven't any-
thing on us. Can you make this out?

The following is an extract from a re-
cent letter fror Dr. T. W. Lingle, for-
merly professor at Davidson, who has
won the badge of honor as a Y secretary
on the fighting front:

“Two days ago I spent a day with
Major McConnell. We surely had a
good time together. Last night I saw
Lieutenant Todd, ‘09. He had been
gassed and was very hoarse. He said
Joe Roddey got five shell wounds at the
same time and is in the hospital. ....
They were with the French in one of
the hardest pushes made this last week.

“I experienced some real war myself
just before leaving the French camp.
One afternoon the American officers (at
Werdun forts), sent an auto for me to
go up ta the batteries and report on my
recent mission. I stayed and took din-
ner in an abri with the lieutenant colonel
and a major. The thundering of the
cannon of various sizes at all sorts of
unexpected nooks and corners for the
two or three hours of my stay got on my
nerves, but I tried to act like a man used
to it all his life. It was interesting to

see three fired in succession and then to}

watch the explosions in succession away
over ona hill held by the enemy. I stay-
ed until 8:30 and the illumination of the
hills and the heavens was wonderful to
me. The enemy made only feeble reply,
the American and French batteries
thundered away all the time from all the
slopes and ravines. Of course aviation
was going on too. Guess I had better
not describe that in detail. When I got
home and tried to sleep, the artillery
was of course some miles away. But
there is one big old grandfather very
near me, overshadowing all others I
have ever heard. He ‘acts’ about every
half hour regularly during the night.
When he lets go, one grabs the rails of
his bed, the earth shudders, and the hills
re-echo for about thirty seconds. I ask-
ed the Frenchmen what the thing is like
when it lands over among the Germans.
‘Trois fois pire’ is the reply. ‘Glad I’m
not there in that case.’ ”
