though no doubt she will be represented at
Princeton by two or more students.

One of the main purposes of the confer-
ence will be to form a permanent organiza-
tion of American students for the purpose of
discussing topics of current national import.
The delegates will convene annually at insti-
tutions in various parts of the country for
this purpose. Among the prominent men
who have heartily endorsed the conference
are Senator William Borah, Vice-President
Dawes, and Chief Justice William Taft.

Warren Cox, who is supported by Davidson
A
campaign has been in progress throughout
the week which has resulted in sufficient
funds being raised among the student body
to support our China representative for an-
other year. The letter follows:

myself, hit it off together to catch a sight
of.the big places in the East. In the States
we couldn't hardly have traveled together for
six weeks without having been brought up
before a police court, but in far-away China,
it never even seemed strange at all, till the
trip was all over. Anyway we had a big
time. Left Shanghai on the Ist of July and
spent two weeks in Peking. Peking is vastly
different from anything else in China—every-
body seems to. think himself just a little bet-
ter than the rest of China—even to the rick-

Warren Cox Writes Interesting Letter tub
of Life and Work in the Far-Off Orient Form Association Soon

The following was received recently from!

South again to Fusan, and a big 12-hour
ferry across to Shimonoseki, Japan!
Japan the trains arrive on time and leave on
time. And there is a train for wherever
you are going, about every hour. We spent
two days in Miyajima, in a Japanese inn;
that is, Jake and I did—the girls decided it

would be better if they keep a la foreign |

style. We had some rare experiences, some
of which I'll tell you when I get back to the
States.

After Miyajima it was forward again to
Nikko, some 36 hours distant, the city of
temples and ‘cleptomaria trees. Nikko is
really an entrancing spot and one would be
almost content to settle down and spend the
rest of one’s dotage among its antique shops
and wooded hills.

Our exchequer was fast being depleted,
so we hastened back to Tokyo, and founda
cheap hotel for three days—having one look,
though, at the Imperial Hotel. Tokyo isn't
nearly as romantic as the story books make
one believe—it’s a modern city in almost
every way. Business rushing and banging
hither and yon, All cireling around the Im
perial Palace grounds which stand in the
middle of the’city, protected from all vulgar
contact by huge walls, and a deep moat, for-
bidding in the extreme; seemingly having its
walls placarded with, “None may enter save
the elect.”

We, not being of the elect crew, boarded
ship at Kobe for Shanghai and had a fine
trip of two days across to China, We left
the two ladies in Tokyo, as they were going
on back to Honolulu.

Broke? It was really pitiful, but we man-
aged to borrow ‘ten from a chance acquaint
ance on the boat, which put us through in
fine shape.

But now it’s school again.

The students are behaving fine after all
the trouble and are studying hard, except in
Peking, where they are still trying to run
the two thousand re-
cently tried to break up the Tariff Confer-
ence, composed of representatives from all
the foreign powers, in order to make the
Conferenee adopt they desired.
That's the way to get results in China ap-
parently but IT don’t imagine that such meth-
will influence much, Our
students, though, are studying hard. The
other day we had an interesting happening :
one of the students went down to Shanghai
and bought a bunch of athletic supplies,
among which were three dozen tennis balls,
in England.” The students being
rabid about the enforcement of the British
boycott, were indignant, and insisted that the
balls be exchanged. Unfortunately they had
been opened and their exchange was rather
doubtful. I suggested to them that they
have a bonfire and burn them to show their
contempt of England, and be patriotic
enough to stand the financial loss! That
didn’t take very well, though, so after about
a month of see-sawing the man who had
bought them made a special trip to Shanghai
and had them exchanged for cheaper German
goods,

By the time this reaches the States the
football season will be over, and to date,
I've heard from but one game! ‘We're a
long way away. I hope it’s been, or is being,
a successful season. I tried my best to get
some interest in American football here, but
the boys haven't reached that stage in their
education yet.

EIGHT STUDENTS GO

Lewis McColgan. Both of these speakers
urged their listeners to play the game of life
fairly and squarely, and their words were
received with enthusiasm.

On Monday evening Clanton Williams and
Harllee Branch were heard by the members
of two Salisbury Hi-Y clubs. Over 50 high
school students were in the audience, and
they seemed impressed with the ideas pre-
sented by the two speakers. The quartette
was called on again for a number of selec- |
tions. Later in the evening the quartette
went to the special night school conducted |
for employed boys, and received much ap- |
plause for their songs. |

This was the first large delegation to have |
been sent out fom Davidson this year, and |
their work at Salisbury has been the occa; |
sion of much favorable comment.
