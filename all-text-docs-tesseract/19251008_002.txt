Three Upper Classes Will Have
Strong Teams—Race to be
Close

As the fall comes on the thoughts of those
interested in the popular sport of. basketball

are now turning toward the class teams

which are making plans to start the ball to

rolling. Last year the then Sophomores

were the champions, but with the loss of

Tom Anderson and Andy Hewlett through
their having made a letter last year has
made the task of building another team of
the same caliber a somewhat difficult task.
Bob Faucette will be greatly missed also

shooting, and Simpson is ever steady at the
guard position. Killard Keerans as a guard
will be in there fighting. For the Seniors,
Hue, Parker, Cook, Moore and Lawson will
form the nucleus around which the Senior
hopes will rest. Last year this bunch made
a team that was hard to beat, and with the
added experience seem to be the logical ones
| to take the championship this year, although
| many strange things happen and they can
never be too sure that their chances will not
be swept away at a minute’s notice by the
better playing of a better team.

For this year’s Sophs, Mauldin, McColgan,
Wilson, Melton, McGeachy and Milner will
furnish a wealth of material from which to
pick a reliable team. This team was pre-
dicted to do great things before the season
starter, but as it wore on they did not seem
to be able to pull together and the inevitable
result was that they could not get the results
that were expected of them. With a better
knowledge of each other they should furnish
a better co-ordinated team and should land
well up in the scale when the season ends.
Brown, who last year was a start at the run-
ning guard position, did not return this year,
and his place will be hard to fill.

As to the team that this year’s Fresh class
will put on the floor there is only guess work
to be done for as yet no move has been made
to get a team together. The Fresh will have
to put a fast team on the floor in order to
do anything against the other classes, and
with this in mind they will probably put
out some extra time in the effort to show
the school a real Fresh team.

These games should furnish some thrilling
moments for those interested and it is hoped
that a great many will avail themselves of
this opportunity, for it is in this way that
Coach Monk is able to get a line on pros-
pective members of the varsity. There area
number of vacancies on the varsity this year
and it will pay every man striving for this
honor to put out everything that he has in
order that the coaches may see just what
kind of a player he is,

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

“Glory be to the Wildcats” said one sport
scribe Saturday, and rightly did he say that.
| Never before (at least not within the realm
of the memory of present students and many
of the faculty members) has a Wildcat team
| fought as the team representing Davidson
| fought last Saturday against Wake Forest in
Charlotte.

We outplayed them. There is no gainsay-
|ing that. Not only is this the viewpoint of
| the Davidson students, but of the entire 6,000
| spectators gathered on Wearn Field. It was
|a great game, and not a single person left

the field with a feeling that he had not re-
| ceived more than his money's worth.

Furthermore, we are glad that Hank Gar-
| rity admitted the superiority of the Davidson

{team when he walked over to Coach Monk

| afterward and told him that Davidson played
|his team all over the field that afternoon.

| We appreciate those words, and that admis-

| sion, coming from a man who is a recog-
| . . . .
'nized genius in football circles everywhere.

|

| SCR er Ore: :
Many attributes go toward making the

team lay as it did Saturday. First of all,
it was because they were working under two
| master minds—those of Coach Monk and
| Coach ‘Tex. It was these two splendid
coaches that imparted to the field the knowl-
edge of the minute points of the game, who
had drilled and labored for one month and
more of strenuous work. It was the cul-
mination of great training, and while to the
players goes unlimited glory, we must not
and we can not forget the coaches behind
that team. .

Occasionally you find the title “miracle”
man attached to some coach, And while we
do not care to make a public claim for our
coaches to be called that, still it seems to us
that it was something of a miracle to tie the
erstwhile declared state champions of North
Carolina,

In fact, one Charlotte fan, though he
slightly favors Davidson, said on Thursday
night before the game that if Davidson tied
the score that day it would be nothing short
of a miracle, and we believe that he would be
glad to call Coach Monk by that title.

So we say, save your shekls, if you can
ever find one; save your loose change, -and
be ready to buy a ticket to the Carolina game
—if we run the: special. If we don’t, then
you'll happen to have a little extra money
about that time.

Manager Regen Announces Definite
Dates and Places for Remaining
Games

That the students of Davidson would get
the opportunity to see three big football
games during this month and the first part |
of next was the outcome of an announcement
made by Manager Kelsey Regen, Monday. |
The scenes of conflict of several important |
contests had been arranged only tentatively |
until a conference held the first part of the |
week between representatives of Davidson |
and those of the other colleges concerned
completed all necessary arrangements.

Presbyterian College of South Carolina
will be played on the Winthrop College ath-
letic field, in Rock Hill. The Blue Stock- |
ings from Clinton have gotten off to a good
start this season, defeating the Tigers of |
Clemson in the opening game of the season. |
Later they handed Erskine a defeat by a
larger score than South Carolina did the
week before. This battle at Rock Hill will |
be on the 17th of this month.

Another dangerous foe hailing from the
Palmetto State is Furman University. The
Purple Hurricane from Greenville handed |
the Generals of Washington and Lee a 20 to
15 defeat last week. This game promises to
be the hardest game of the year for the
Wildcats. The people of Charlotte are to
be given another chance to sce the Davidson
team play this year as the game is to be
stagd on Wearn Field. Furman comes to
Charlotte to battle the Wildcats on the 24th.

Through this arrangement N. C. State will
be brought to the Hill on the last day of
| October. As State decisively downed Duke
Saturday they appear to be a very formidable ;
foe. It has been rumored around the campus |
| that the 31st is to be “Home-Coming Day”
| for all old Davidson men, so no doubt there
| will be a large crowd on hand to witness the
| Wildcats and the Wolf Pack grapple.

These games will have important bearing
on the championship of the two Carolinas as |
the Presbyterians and the Baptists have two |
of the strongest teams in the Palmetto State |
this season. In addition to these’ three con- |
tests with teams that are considered regu-
lars on the Davidson schedule, Hampden-Sid- |
ney is to play the Wildcats on the 7th of No- |
vember. The place of this contest is still |
| undecided, but indications point to the fact
| that it will take place either at Salisbury or
| Winston-Salem. The Virginians have an un- |
