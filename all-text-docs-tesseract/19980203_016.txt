Hey, Buzz, grow up

By DanieL Motz

BOONE — After a truly gut-
wrenching basketball game here on
Saturday, the postgame press confer-
ence should have focused on key'plays,
clutch performances, .and big shots.
Instead, the main topic of discussion?
Basketballs.

After fielding a few questions af-
ter his team’s 77-71 loss to Davidson,
Appalachian’s coach Buzz Peterson
went on a tirade, apparently providing
an excuse for the defeat.

App. St. has a Nike sponsorship.
The Mountaineers receive clothes, ap-
parel, and basketballs from Swoosh.
They practice — and previously played
their games — with Nike basketballs.

“T have never seen a bunch com-
plain about basketballs like they do,”
said Peterson, referring-to Davidson.
“There is no written rule claiming what
brand of ball to use in conference play.”

Actually, Buzz, you are wrong.

Wilson, not Nike, is the sponsor of
the Southern Conference. In a league
memorandum, dated July 1, 1996, it
clearly states, “The entire Conference
must adopt a Wilson game basketball
and use the basketball in all conference
games for three years.”

Perhaps if Buzz knew a rule ex-
isted, he would have ceased his com-

plaining. But he didn’t know and he
continued whining.

“Maybe they are envious because
we have a Nike sponsorship,” he
moaned.

“If they want a sponsorship that
badly, [can have them get in touch with
my old roommate (referring to his
former North Carolina teammate and
number one Nike sponsor Michael Jor-
dan).”

Classy, Buzz, very classy.

In fact, Davidson does have a Nike
sponsorship— iteven received the spon-
sorship before App. St.

The Wildcats just have enough
sense to practice and play with the brand
of basketballs that is sponsored by the
league. Apparently, Buzz, you don’t

men made such a difference.

Conference frontrunner Appalachian St.
at Varsity Gym.

“We've reviewed what we’re go-
ing to need to make a stretch run,” said
coach Bob McKillop after the gamé,
“and certainly pounding the ball inside
is going to be a key factor.”

So pound they did. And the Wild-
cats’ quartet of post players — Chadd
Holmes, Stephen Marshall, Landry
Kosmalski, and Ben Ebong — re-
sponded to the challenge.

Marshall, making his first start
since the Siena game Jan. 8, tied his

in just 15 minutes
of action.

“Chadd gave us a great boost off
the bench,” McKillop understated.

Kosmalski, who has struggled this
year to live up to the hype he created
with league freshman of the year hon-
ors last season, notched nine points,
including a three from the right wing
that tied the game at 60 with 6:49 to go
and a soft fail-away jumper in the lane
to give the Wildcats the lead on the
ensuing possession.

And Ben Ebong, Davidson’s
bundle of instant charisma off the bench,
led the squad with seven rebounds and
scored five points —the fourth and fifth
of which came on a monster dunk off an

70-68 advantage with less than a minute

“They were much better in the
post than I thought they were,” Appala-
chian coach Buzz Peterson said. “They
played a very physical game.

“Holmes and Marshall were the
keys to the game. We could not stop
them. They were exceptional down
low. Those two guys really kicked our
butts today.”

Something Holmes and Marshall,
along with Kosmalski and Ebong, as a
unit, are capable of doing to any South-
ern team on any night.

The key to that type of consis-
tency?

“Opportunity and confidence,”
Holmes replied.

And McKillop and his staff know
full well that with 50 points of produc-
tion from their can-be fearsome four-
some down low, the Wildcats aren’t
going to lose many more in Southern
play.

Wildcats send message
in 77-71 victory over
Appalachian State

By Daniet Morz
Senior Staff Writer

BOONE, N.C. — The men’s basketball
team made a statement here Saturday
afternoon.

Davidson — the winningest team
in the league for the past two seasons
and the preseason favorite to win the
conference again this year — is still the
team to beat in the Southern Confer-
ence.

“We haven’ t been playing our best
basketball, but I think we're starting to
now,” said Chadd Holmes, who scored
16 points on a perfect six-of-six shoot-
ing from the field.

“Appalachian has to know it still
has to go through Davidson to win the
Southern Conference.”

The Wildcats handed Appalachian
St. their first conference loss of the
season, 77-71, in a thriller.

Davidson fought back several

times in the final minutes to steal the
victory from the Mountaineers. Trail-
ing 68-64 with less than three minutes
remaining in the contest, the Wildcats
went on a 10-0 spurt to claim the vic-
tory.

“We made big plays all day,” said
Davidson coach Bob McKillop. “When
we were up, when were down, and
when it was even.” ,

And notwoplays were bigger than
a pair of dunks in the game’s final
moments.

The first was a Stephen Marshall
— who tied his career-high with 20
points — follow off of a missed Davor
Halbauer fastbreak layup. That tied the
game at 68.

On Davidson’s ensuing posses-
sion, the Wildcats’ ball movement dis-
sected the Mountaineers’ zone. The
result was a Ben Ebong throw-down off
of an assist from Ali Ton-to give
Davidson the lead for good.

“It was a slip and cross screen,”
said McKillop. “Ben was able to find a
seam and slip in.”

Ton, who finished with eight
points, nine assists, and five steals,
sealed the victory by intercepting a
Tyson Patterson pass and streaking in
for a layup.

After trailing 22-18 in the first
half, the Wildcats went on a 12-0 run to
seemingly take control. But the Moun-
taineers cut the Davidson lead to four at
the break.

The game was scheduled as the
second game of the week between these
two teams, but due to the snowstorm in
the western part of the state, App. St.
apparently was unable to make the trip
to Davidson.

The game at Belk Arena, origi-
nally slated for Tuesday, was postponed
until Wednesday. After Wednesday's
postponement, the game is now set for
Feb. 19.
