Chapel Conduct.

Once again the problem of deplorable
chapel conduct has come to our attention,
Once again the student body must be im-
plored to give some attention to this problem
and decide whether or not something rust
be done to remedy our chapel manners.

The other day in chapel an outside speaker
was not only allowed to ‘speak without the
dignity of catealls, newspaper reading and
studying—he was even listened to atten-
tively for one three-minute period. This sit-
uation is deplorable. It is not in keeping with
Davidson--Wildeat—chapeltraditions..

What is the student body coming to when
passers-by on the highway cannot tell by
sounds emanating from under the dome that
chapel is going on? How can tle student feel
that his'day is complete if he does not exer-
cise the mental side of his nature by think-
ing up bigger and better chapel sound ef-
fects?

Carl Pahl’s announcements must not be,

_heard! Rise up, Oh nten of. Davidson, and

make them inaudible!

taken by “Tustful John” to the
City of Sin, or the reverent  pil-

grimage of “Jake the Rake” to the
Holy City. “Mike” and “Buddy”
turned lovers while “Alex” didn't

even hold a feverish polin, “Double
Dip” looked like the ‘“!hin Man,”
while “Simple” looked like a kid;
“Shep” preached the gospel
the Kinsey report and “Gopher"
wrote a poem in the Keats’ flavor;
“Terrible Tun” Hopper and Hunter
went wild, while Dickie and Hurd
were peaceful, Liston and Potts
turned women-haters, while “Murd”
and “Bufe” fell prey to the fair sex;
Carl made a speech in the William
Jennings Bryan while John Lyles
stuttered and stammered.

As if this wasn't enough contrast
the Ata Bita Pi's snooted everyone
on the campus and the Snaper
Snifs rolled out the welcome mat.
The Morris Field Policeman's Club
Was reinstated after fire and police
raids two week-ends in succession,
one in secession. The Harbor Club
swept the bay into the river only
to uncover two broken fiddles, a
guitar, four jugs and one harmonica,
The Woman's Club boarded its
windows in preparation for a blast
next Saturday.

When the boys found themselves
on the way back, they happened to
remember that the blessed day of
hitch-hiking had cost them $57,000
It all seemed quite discouraging
to shell Git so much to delay their

sigh of “What price freedom?”

Bogus Money Running Loose

Washington — Two huge coun.
terfeit rings, one in New York and
one in Chicago, are flooding the
nation with bogus $10 and $20 bills
representing millions of dollars.

Disclosure of the existence of two
rings was made by the Secret Sery-
ice after the Federal Reserve Pank
of New York announced that a
“substantial number”-of nearly per
fect copies of bank notes were cir-
culated throughout the greater New
York area in the biggest counter-

feiting. operation in the United
States in 14 years.
Bank officials warned shoppers,

merchants and commercial banks to
watch sharply for the bogus bills.

The New York bank officials said.

fake money also had been found in
Chicago, but a secret service spokes-
man here said there | was no con-
wy ne.
He said the $10 and $20 bills passed
out by ‘the Chicago gang are not
like those discovered in New York,
If the two rings were working to-
gether, there would be no point in
their using different plates with
which to print their “money.”

The Secret Service said the
spurious New York bills had not
been circulated beyond the New
York area as far as it knew, but
the Chicago ring had outlets in
nearly all parts of the country. ;

The Chicago gang was said’ to

have been active for several months.
At first its product was found only
in the Midwest. However, evidence
of its operations has been found in
Pucific Coast States, along the en-

tire Eastern Seaboard and in the
South.
Relatively little of the bogus

money had turned up in Chicago,
Officials said. Two passers were
under arrest, but the ring cannot be
broken until the printing machinery
is discovered. While the New York
bills bear the symbol of the Chicago
Federal Reserve stamp, printed in
Chicago, a Secret Service spokesman
said,

The Federal Reserve Bank in
New York said commercial banks
were taking daily losses from re-
ceipts of the fake bills. Té coun-
terfeit currency first was detected
in New York when employes of the
Reserve Bank there were sorting
notes issued originally in Chicago
for return to Chicago.

Officials estimated the amount
of bogus money in the hands of the
public might run in to “millions of

dollars.” They said. the last big
counterfeiting ring, operated by
“Count” Victor Lustig flooded the

country with $2,500,000,
