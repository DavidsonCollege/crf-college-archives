Womens' soccer wins 5-1

By Shannon Lowrance
& William Robert

The women’s soccer team travelled to
Georgia Southern to collect their first con-
ference win of the season with a command-

ing 5-1 victory on Saturday.

The Wildcats dominated the game, play-
ing the majority of the game on their
opponent’s half of the field. Freshman Amy
Kanoff scored the first two goals, both of
which were beautifully executed and gave

the Eagles’ goalkeeper no chance of stop-
ping them. Junior Claudia Lombard then
took over the scoring, putting two balls in
the back of the net; both of her goals fol-
lowed excellent set-ups by senior Ellen
Sprinkle. Sophomore Kelly Ammann gave
the Wildcats their final goal before the end
of the first half. The second half was score-
less, as the Wildcats continued to control the

Hoops star joins pro team in Slovenia

By Traci Cliett

Following in the tradition of
Davidson’ s international basketball
players, Janko Narat (‘94) has ac-
cepted an offer to play in the
Slovenian professional league.

Coach Bob McKillop said
Litus, a lower-ranked team, signed
Narat in early August, making him
the highest paid player in the divi-
sion. Narat was offered a contract
with the top team in the league, but
he decided “he would have an im-
mediate advantage to play with
Litus,” McKillop said. McKillop
added that Narat felt “he had an
opportunity with Litus to help im-
prove the program.”

The Slovenian pro league be-
gins their season this week and will
continue into April. In his free time,
Narat will also play for the
Slovenian National team with
whom he has been playing all sum-
mer. The National team did not
qualify for the World Basketbnall
Championship this past summer,
but they have their sights set on
qualifying next June for the At-
lanta Olympics.

conference meet at Furman later
this fall.” Mens’ Coach Andrew
feels that it was important for his
young squad to get the first meet
under their belts. Of special men-
tion was freshman Josh Cookson,
who finished thirteenth overall but
also finished the ASU 8K course at
26:48, the third fastest time for a
Davidson runner on that particular
course. It should also be noted that
the Davidsonrunners who recorded
faster times were both seniors when
their records were established.
Both coaches feel that their
teams are close-knit ones with the
crucial understanding of team
chemistry, and blessed with se-
niors — in particular Bishop for
the women and Erik McMichael
for the men — who can provide
experienced leadership. In a sport
where there is a great deal of em-
phasis on the individual, the team
conceptis vital to success. “People
don’t recognize the effort cross-
country requires; it’s basically
- year-round training from cross
country in the fall on into indoor/
outdoor track in the winter nd
spring,” noted Coach Andrew.
Davidson’s next meet is at Vir-
ginia Tech on September 17th, and
should both teams should continue
to improve for the upcoming con-

ference championships at UTC and -

the NCAA Division I Regionals at
Furman.

player from Davidson to play in-
ternationally. Detlef Musch (Ger-
many), James Marsh (Germany),
and Frantisek Babka (Czech Re-
public) have each found their niche
inthe European pro leagues. These
four alumni will play against each
other during international games.

Each of them are either back
in school or. are considering it.
Marsh is at the University of Trier
for chemical engineering, and
Babka is studying international

law. Musch and Narat are expected
to return to school next year.
McKillop said their Davidson aca-
demic background affected their
desire for further education.
Narat, wholed last year’s team
with 17.7 points per game, is living
45 minutes from his hometown of
Domzale in ‘an apartment which
was included in his contract. He
may return to the United States
next summer to participate in the
Charlotte Hornets free-agent camp.

Game of the Week draws
smaller crowds than expected

By Randy Hartwell

Fewer fans than expected at-
tended the first game of the much-
anticipated “Match of the Week”
program, although attendance in-
creased for last week’ s South Caro-
lina vs. Rutgers game. Regarding
the August 31 Virginia vs. San
Francisco contest, Athletic Direc-
tor Terry Holland says, “We were
alittle disappointed with the crowd
(at the first match), but we hope
that we can build on each game, so
that it becomes self-supporting.”

Davidson established the
event to bring nationally-ranked

‘men’s college soccer teams to play

at Richardson Field.

Men’s soccer Coach Charlie
Slagle considered it a “decent first
crowd” but cites other circum-
stances that may have prevented
optimum participation. “Virginia’s
the furthest away of the ‘home’
teams, and there are not many local
alums. It was also the first one, and
an exhibition match,” he says.

Lack of publicity and high
admission prices may have con-
tributed to the relatively low 1,364
person turnout. Sophomore Tiese
Manigo says, “I was pretty unin-
formed—I only knew about it be-
cause I saw them setting up. Also,
it was five bucks, so that kind of
deterred me. If tickets were
cheaper, that would boost atten-
dance.” Officials are not relying
solely on Davidson student atten-
dance; however, they encourage
students to come to the games.

Special Projects Manager Lee
Sargent sees the game as a spring-
board for future success. “We’re
developing a good group of soccer
fans; we’re still neophytes at this,”
he says.

Of the September 7 South
Carolina vs. Rutgers match, fresh-
man Naresh Nagella says “my
whole floor was at the game.”
Slagle promises that those that do
come “‘will get the chance to see
some great soccer and be on TV.”
