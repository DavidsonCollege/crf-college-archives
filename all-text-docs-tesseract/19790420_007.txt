Paintings exhibit emotions, experiences

It’s difficult to walk past
Chambers Gallery these days
without slowing down and peer-

- ing through the doors. Colorful
paintings overwhelm you. The
paintings are part of the collec-
tion of Davidson’s art profes-
sor, Russ Warren. His exhibit.
opened April 3 and continues
until April 23.

Artist Russ Warren paints «
his imagination. The reds, yel-
lows, turqoises, oranges,
greens, and blues pull you like
magnets towards his paintings,
with curiousity and wonder.
Their brightness makes them
come alive. The winding
shapes, dotted expressions,
many-pointed stars, and animal
images work together to repre-
sent some personal experiences
and emotions of the artist.

Whether it be an emotion, an
experience, or a place, every
artist incorporates something
about himself in his artwork.
Warren begins all his paintings
with something personal or
autobiographical in mind.
Through the painting process,
the visual interpretation of the
idea may change, but the idea
itself stays the same.

Painting is a form of self-dis-
covery. Russ Warren’s paint-
ings clearly reveal this. The
skulls, the mountains, the cacti,
and the dogs represent a time
and mood in his life that he has
chosen to recreate and share.

Warren grew up in Houston,
Texas among musicians and art
museums. ‘I always wanted to
be a musician,’’ Warren says,

“so I started taking trumpet
lessons when I was six years
old, and then later learned &

play the bass and piano. When I
wasn't playing an instrument I
loved to draw and visit art
museums.”’

He found by the age of 18 or
19 that he no longer was
interested in pursuing music as
a career. He wanted something
he could do alone, and this
wasn't possible with music. Art
offered this release. ‘‘I wanted
to have total.control,"’ Warren
adds.

He entered the University of
St. Thomas in Houston, as an
art major; and then transferred
to the University of New Mexi-
co, where he developed his
techniques and skills in print-
making and painting from the
vast exposure to great artists.

‘The only way to grow as an
artist,"’ Warren explains, ‘‘is to
set up your own studio away
from academics."’ His studio
was a nice retreat from the
academic atmosphere. ‘‘As I
painted more, the exposure to
print-making at school made a
nice compliment to my paint-
ae:

While in New Mexico; War-

n became attracted to and
Gnbseated in the Mexican folk

rt. “It has a quality which is
both fierce and funny,’’ Warren
comments. He began to incor-
porate in his paintings colors
and images that characterize
much of Mexican folk art. A
funny, primitive, dog-like
sculpture intrigued him most.

“Once a friend of mine told
me I needed to use dogs in my
paintings,'’ Warren says, ‘‘so,

- he presented to my wife,

daughter and me a gift which
was a puppy. It was too young
to even recognize the breed.”
That was six years ago. The
dog, a golden retriever, grew up
as a second child for Warren
and as a new brother to his
daughter.

He named the dog, Zeke, and
began to use him in his paint-

ings, making the style a com-
bination of the dog-like Mexi-
can folk art sculpture and the
Style of one of his favorite
artists, Picasso. ‘‘An artist
critiqued my work once, de-
scribing Zeke as my alter- -ego. I
usually don’t agree with critics,
but the more I thought about
this the more truth I saw in it.
Zeke became a part of my
alter-ego,’* Mr. Warren Says.

The dog traveled everywhere
with Warren, to Texas, Florida,
and to Davidson, N.C., as his
paintings reveal, Zeke died in
January, 1979 and with his
death came a change in War-
ren’s paintings. A saddened
mood and images of death
began to haunt the canvas.

In the painting, ‘Zeke in
Florida,” finished before Zeke’s
death, Warren paints with
bright, summery colors. of
orange, ocean blue, sandy yel-
low, and green. Zeke's cream-
colored body, encircled by what
appears to be the arms of a
Mexican designed bracelet,
dominates the painting.
Beaches of sand, lanky palm
trees, and ocean-blue colors fill
the background. The bright
coloring and wavy-like characte
of Zeke’s bady suggest his viva-
ciousness and spirit. Warren
captures him in motion as Zeke
runs from one side of a roadway
to the other.

In ‘Memories of Fort Stock-
ton,’ finished after Zeke’s
death, Warren's mood and emo-
tion changes. No longer is there
a high-spirited, happy feeling
expressed. A mysterious, eerie,
almost frightful feeling pre-
vails.

The colors have changed to
shades of purple, deep, blood
red, and shades of blue-greens.
Zeke stands motionless by the
shadowing light of a campfire.
A deep red surrounds the fire
and the area where Zeke stands,
creating a powerful contrast

The Y Fund Drive begins
Saturday, April 21, with Y-Fun
Day, involving a variety of
activities.

The second annual frisby-golf
tournament will start off the
afternoon. David Huie, who is
in charge of the tournament,
will also be selling cokes all day
at the track meet and during the
tournament.

A variety of games such as
badminton, volleyball and
horseshoes will be held before
the barbeque.

The barbeque begins at 6:30
p.m. in front of Chambers. The
dinner will be $2.00 and in-
cludes chicken, potato salad,
cookies and iced tea. If it rains
the dinner will be held in the
gallery.

Village Green from 2:00 until
4:00 p.m. Faculty will be ser-
ving, and the price is $0.15 a
scoop.

The actual fund drive is
scheduled for Monday, April
23, through Friday, April 27.

‘*We’re changing our style
for the fund drive this year,”
said L.C. Brewster, president of
the Y Student Service Corps.
‘Instead of a door-to-door cam-
paign, we're issuing a challenge
between faculty and the stu-
dents to see who can raise the
most change.”’

Containers will be placed in
the Union, Chambers and the
Library for collecting the mon-
ey. Tables will also be set up
from 10-11-a.m., so that admin-

istration, faculty and students’

will contribute.

The Y Student Service Corps
depends entirely on contribu-
tions. The fund drive has been
moved from the fall to the
spring because, Treasurer Eli-
zabeth Medlin explains, “The
money we raise this spring will
be the total budget for next
year.”

Warren enjoys working with
images. As well as the one of
Zeke, he incorporates other
images into his paintings.

In “Rain Prayer’’, a comical,
dotted figure extends its arms
to the sky. Its seven-fingered,
imaginary figure is set apart
from the mountains and sky but
the many dots that wind around
to fill its body. The maroon,
brown, and gold mountains look
heavy and massive, contrasting
with the light and airy, almost
spiritual being that kneels and
prays to the sky for rain.

WDAV expands programming, staff

By ROBERT PAYNE
~ Staff Writer

‘Ina flurry of activity over the
past 2 weeks, WDAV has
expanded its programming,
hired a full-time chief announcer
and possibly corrected its signal
interference with TRANSCO.

The program expansion con-
sists of three hours of non-

classical. programming _ added
from 10-1 each night. Fitting

under the label of ‘‘non-clas-

sical” are jazz, réck and folk
shows as well as ‘‘contemporary
classical.’’ Each night’s line-up
breaks down to a speciality
show (focusing on a particular
contemporary genre) from:10-11,
followed by ‘‘Flipsides,’’ free-
form alternative ja#Z and rock,
from 11-1.

The shows are done on a
voluntary basis by students—
the exceptions are “‘The Ear of
the Beholder” done by WDAV
Director Ed McIntyre and a
jazz show by Phil Cunieff, a
WRPL deejay.

McIntyre says the programs
were added “‘first of all for the
listeners, as well as for the staff
who had interest in program-
ming.'’ Freshman Michael Kehs
who produces “*Jazz Archive”
sees WDAV as “now fulfilling
part of one role as an alternative

_ Seaton, an well asa fine arts

station.”

On the whole) ‘McIntyre _ is
“satisfied” with the new pro-
gamming, “but we can all do
better—both classical and non-

Ip Qu

——

classical. It is a matter of what
we can achieve with the record
companies and man-hours.”

In the coming year McIntyre
hopes both to expand. the
records and the staff.

- As part of that expansion, he
has -hired a full-time chief
announcer — Regina Scruggs, a

‘music major from Beloit. Col-
lege. She has had experience in
college radio both at Beloit and
at Northwestern.where she did
her graduate work.

As for other full-time em-

ployers, McIntyre would.like to
“eventually have four full time
employees”’ with the idea of ©
‘moving to National Public Ra-
dio status, “But that’ depends
on the budget,”’ according to
McIntyre.

WDAV may have avoided an
immediate ‘“‘major capital out-
lay”. on a new tower by shiel-
ding TRANSCO’s microwave
equipment. WDAY’s signal had
been interfering with TRANS-
CO’s gas pipeline microwave
relay system, prompting en-
gineer Frank Hall to ask
WDAV to lower power to 50
percent; producing a’ situation

that Mclatyre called ‘barely
tolerable. VDAV éngineer
Fred M 2 had shielding
