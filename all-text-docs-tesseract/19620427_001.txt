Arts Festival Sponsors
Artist, Sculptor, Plays

BY CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Staff Writer

James and Judy Bumgardner, experimental artists, visit Davidson Monday and
4 present two student-written one-act plays Wednesday

Tuesiay, and the Vagabon

and Thursday to near

y complete this year’s Fine Arts Festival next week. Only the

‘ormance of Mozart's Bastien and Bastienne by the Lenoir-Rhyne College music
department here on May 9 will remain after next week’s activities.

James Bumgardner, a pictor-
ial artist, teaches at Richmond
Professional Institute; his wife
Judy, a sculptor, teaches art at
the Collegiate School, also in
Richmond, Va. Examples of his
oil painting and her polychrome
sculpture will be displayed in
the Fine Arts Center from Mon-
day, April 30 until Wednesday,
May 16.

While on campus, the Bum-
gardners will work together
in their discussions with stud-
ents on exploratory § tech-
niques in painting and sculp-
ture. On Monday at noon, they
will lead an informal discus-
sion on contemporary Ameri-
can painting and sculpture

. and its relationship to the art
of other periods and cultures
in the Chorus Room of the
Fine Arts Center.

On exhibit in the Center from
April 30 until May 26, will be
paintings, drawings, and prints
created by Davidson students.
The Bumgardners will select

winners after offering criticism
on the works submitted in an
informal session beginning at
2:30 Monday afternoon in the
Studio Area of the Center.

The last scheduled activity for
the Bumgardners will be a dis-
cussion of the mainstream of
contemporary American paint-
ing and sculpture Tuesday eve-
ning at 8:15 in the Studio Area
of the Fine Arts Center.

The Vagabonds will stage '
two short one-act plays, one |
by William Moss and one by
Don Stowell, at 8:15 Wednes-
day and Thursday evenings in
Hodson Hall.

Prof. John Sneden, who with
Prof. Goodykoontz selected the|
two to be presented from the
ten submitted, characterized
both as “offbeat — symbolic
rather than realistic.”

Moss’s play, Beyond These
Walis, is a serious play, and
uses five actors. Stowell’s A
Morning After the Fig Tree
Bloomed, uses only three actors,
and treats its serious subject
more lightly, incorporating some

comedy. After the presentation

of each play, its author will be
introduced to the audience for a
discussion of his work.

Dr. R. S. Wilson,
Trustee, Succumbs

Dr. Ronald S. Wilson, a
Trustee and alumnus of David-
son College, died Sunday night,
April 15, in Miami, following a
heart attack.

Dr. Wilson, minister of
the Westminister Presbyterian
Church in Miami, was a member
of the Class of 1927 at Davidson,
receiving his AB degree here.

In 1930 he received his BD
degree at Riichmond’s Union
Theological Seminary, and his
ThD there in 1931. In May of
1945, Davis and Elkins College
in Elkins, W. Va., awarded Wil-
son:an honorary DD degree.

Born in Clarion, Penn. in
1902, Wilson was also a Trustee
of Florida Presbyterian College
and a member of the Assembly's
Board of Church Extension.

His son, Dr. Robert S. Wilson,
Jr., a member of the Davidson
Class of 1955, is Assistant Pro-
fessor of Psychology at the Uni-
versity of Towa.

The by-law for Section 15 of
the Student Body Constitution
calls for the Student Council to
appoint from its members a rep-
resentative to both the Academ-
ic Scheduling Committee and
the Non-Academic Scheduling
Committee. The new by-law al-
so makes provisions for the
council to appoint from the
Student Body at large a repre-
sentative to the Religious Life
Committee and two representa-
tives to the Athletic Council.

The second by-law was added
to Section 8 of the constitution
and defines the purpose. of
the Student-Faculty Conference
Committee. The by-law states
that the committee “shall have
as its purpose the promotion of
a free interchange of ideas and
viewpoints upon college matters
of general interest to the stud-
ents and the faculty ... Any
student or member of the facul-
ty has a full right and privilege
to meet with the committee to
express any ideas which he
might hold for the good of the
college.”

i Both of the by-laws received

Caldwell Wins 1962
Vereen Bell Award

Price Caldwell, author of
the short story ‘“Wildcat-
ters’’ is the winner of the
Vereen Bell Memorial -A-
ward for 1961-62. Bill Moss
and Bill Pruitt received sec-
ond and third places respec-
tively.

Caldwell will receive the $75
cash prize which is awarded for
the best creative writing in any
field that is submitted in the
competition.

The award, announced yester-
day in the chapel program, is
given in memory of Vereen Bell,
Class of 1932, who was killed in
action in World War II.

Bell was the author of the
very successful novel Swamp
Water and several short stories.
He was considered a very prom-
ising young writer in view of
the works he had written.

The English Department spon-
sors the honor award. This year,
less than forty authors submit-
ted entries to the contest. Of
these the English Department
picked and submitted seven en-
tries for final judgment.

The final judge for the best
entry was Guy Owen, PhD in
BPnglish, who was on campus this
past week on leave from Stetson
University. Dr. Owen, himself a
novelist and poet, is author of
the novel Season of Fear, and
founder of the poetry journal
impetus to help emerging poets.

Carrell’s Council Leaps
Into Legislative Action

After the first two meetings under President Danny Carrell, the Student Coun-
cil has two new by-laws to the constitution and a new Freshman Court to show for its
efforts. In addition, the council last week passed a request that the faculty strike the
holiday clause from the new cut regulations.

Festivities Flow Freely
FromFrolickers’ Spring

D Club, Torch Singer
Will Entertain Tonight

The last late date is made. The last shaft letter lies
shredded in one of the waste cans at the post office. This
evening the 1962 Spring Frolics weekend opens with
laughter, music, dancing, and off-campus parties.

“I have never had such a
slim dance weekend,” dorm su-
pervisor Mrs. J. B. Moore com-
mented Wednesday. If the con-
dition has remained constant
as she expected, about 80 of the
600 beds set up for dates in
Belk and Richardson dormitor-
ies will be. unused, making this
the year’s most sparsely-attend-
ed dance weekend.

First officially scheduled ac-
tivity is the D Club “Foolies”
in’ Chambers auditorium from 7
until 8:30 p.m. Following, from
9 until 12 p.m. is a semi-formal
dance in the gymnasium. The

Bryant Will Head
Wildcat Cheerers

‘by Bryant will head the
cheerleader squad next year.
Bryant, a rising junior from
Atlanta, was chosen by the other
cheerleaders after being elected
to the squad in student body
voting Monday and Tuesday. He
is a member of Phi Delta Theta
fraternity and plays on the soc-
cer team. Bruce Covington, an-
other rising junior, was also
elected to the squad. He is a
member of Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity.

“It is unusual for a junior to
be elected, but I think Bryant
is unusually capable of doing
a good job,” ex-head cheerlead-
er Joe Martin stated after the
election.

Next fall the cheerleaders
plan to work with the incoming
freshmen at the “Y" camp and
before Rush Week. They also
plan to use more tumbling with
their cheers next year.

BY DON STOWELL
Davidsonian Feature Writer

What does it take to make a film? If junior David Simpson were asked that ques-|
tion, he would probably respond with a string of very basic Anglo-Saxon terms, large-

ly unprintable, for he and a devoted crew have been making “Aurora”

weeks and it is still not ready for release,

Simpson's original screenplay,
written for Creative Writing,
was completed shortly after
second semester had begun. The
dialogue sections were some-
what revised and the cast select-
ed.

START FILMING

Even before the only girl in
the cast had been chosen, Pat
Douglas, Stuart Jamison and
Simpson began shooting — the
first scenes at a professor's
home. Two Saturday afternoons
and a Sunday morning were re-
quired to film the first ten or
fifteen minutes of the story.

The dialogue scene between
Pat and Stuart required that
both men be smoking. In the
five hours needed to shoot the
five-minute sequence, each used
a full pack of cigarettes.

After Dianne Harris of Char-
lotte was selected to play the
dream girl, Aurora, rainy weath-
er delayed shooting the required
outdoor and evening sequences.

PRE.DAWN SHOOTING

However, one Saturday at 2
a.m. filming was begun on the
two street encounters on South
Tryon Street in Charlotte in
front of the North Carolina Na-
tional Bank. The last sequence
in the film was shot first be-
cause the battery-powered movie
light borrowed from WBTV had
a life span of only 15 minutes.
It died out as the last scene was
being shot.

About 4 a.m. the street meet-
ing in the dream was shot and
Simpson secured himself on the
hood of his car to get tracking
shots of Pat driving through the
deserted city

EDITING AND SOUND
Another day was spent mak
ing incidental shots in the dor-
mitory, an office in, the College
Union, and in an exhibition
room at the Fine Arts Building.

shooting went along and the job

sound track music. One of the |
rolls of the dream sequence had
come back over-exposed and had
to be sent to the processors for
correction.
Finally, the roughly edited
film was sent to New York for

fraternity house.

Clemson Jungleers are provid.
ing dance music; Dakota Staton
will sing “torch songs” during
the intermissions.

The “Foolies,” annually
presented during Spring Fro-
lics by’ the D Club, is based
this evening on the differing
impressions a, Davidson stud-
ent returning home gives to
first his parents, then to a
prospective student, of frater-
nity life at Davidson. It will
be presented as a two act
play, in which D Club mem-
bers will play both male and
female roles.

The show features two musi-
cal groups from Queens Col-
lege, and two from Davidson.
Sarah Pollard and the Queen-

ston Trio have come from
Queens; Hub Knox's combo,
The Dimensions, and Alex

Bernhardt represent Davidson.
In the intermission, the trophy
for the year’s outstanding fresh-
man athlete will be presented
by D Club president Bruce
Usher.

The dance will have a figure
which will be used to present
the newly elected IFC repre-
sentative and the fraternity
sweethearts.

The only IFC scheduled ac-
tivity for Saturday is a con-

cert by Lester Flatt, Earl
Scruggs and the Foggy Moun-
tain Boys at 1 p.m. Flatt and
Scruggs, recognized as best
in the “bluegrass” music field,
play with unamplified instru-
ments, so the concert will be
held indoors in Chambers
auditorium instead of out-
doors as earlier planned.

New IFC president Johnny
Rogers noted this afternoon
that admission for the ‘‘Poolies,”

the dance, and the concert will

be under the new policy. This
policy requires fraternity men
to present a pin or card, and
Independents to present a tic-
ket.

Other events on campus will
be the Davidson Relays at 3 p.m.

John Kuykendall, Assistant
Dean of Students, noted today
that the curfew hours at the
fraternity houses will be 5 on
Saturday morning and 3 on Sun-
day morning, the same as on .
