Overconfidence

Ever since the Holland-Hetzel-Snyder era of Da-
vidson ‘basketball, a new season has been looked for-
ward to as an opportunity for national recognition of
the Davidson team. This year is no exception.

Davidson fans are looking for a change from the
mediocrity that has been present among athletics
since September. Everyone from the College adminis-
tration to the janitors in Belk Dorm expects the basket-
ball team to do marvelous things and sweep opponents
aside with relative ease. Observers talk about how good
the Davidson team is, but fail to mention the tough

schedule that we face.

No one is a pushover and the players know it. The
regular schedule is difficult, not to mention the two
Christmas tournaments which look tougher than the
Southern Conference tournament. When the renowned
team of Hetzel, Snyder and company played, they had
to “get up’ for only five or six games on their sched-
ule while playing teams like Jacksonville U. and Wof-
ford in between. No such luck this year. We have to be
ready for every game. True, we have some old grudges
to settle with Michigan, William & Mary, Duke, WVU,
VPI and Tulane, but these teams think they are the

«underdog, and the underdog has nothing to lose but
the game which has already been conceded by the

“experts.”

Having a good seat for the games, 1 usually feel
the moods and attitudes of the team. We are entirely
too overconfident for our own good. The two pre-
season scrimmages against N. C. State and Georgia
showed none of the all-important teamwork which
must be there if we are to be a good team. Sure, we
may run over Bucknell and VMI with our good individ-
ual play, but against Michigan and Vanderbilt it could
be different without teamwork.

The most asked question is ‘“‘who is going to start?”
The only positive answer I can give to this problem is
that I won’t. But even if the starting team is a mystery
it doesn’t matter. Lefty says, “It’s not the team that
starts but the one that finishes that’s important.”
Unfortunately, the finishing team is a mystery also.

It seems as though everyone from the townies at
Hattie’s to the businessmen in Charlotte have been
reading with breathless anticipation, those pre-season
basketball magazines, which rank us from third to 12th,
depending upon how much the magazine costs. The
players read these, too. (We can read, despite rumors).
Pre-season polls do little but to make the opposition
angry and give us a big head.

As Lefty says, “It makes us think we are better
than we are.” The pre-season AP poll has ranked us
10th, one behind Vanderbilt, which is the only team
on our schedule that is rated. This means that all the
other teams will be, as our coach said, “knocking down

the dressing room doors to get at us.”

Dr. Scott

better put in an order for some reinforced locker room
doors. Bucknell and VMI will probably be knocking
down more than doors to beat us.

With a much stronger team
than last year, the Wildcat
grapplers began their sea-
son this afternoon against
VMI. The meet, wrestied on
the Davidson mats, opened a
tough schedule of nine dual
meets for the grapplers.

Hatcher
Is Chosen
As Captain

Sam Hatcher. two year vet-
eran of the Davidson tennis
team. was elected by the
members of this year’s team
to be captain for the 67-68
season. Hatcher, known bet-
ter by his nickname Pinky.
has been outstanding on the
tennis team for the past two
years.

He played number two in
both singles and doubles com-
petition both seasons. Hatch-
er won the Southern Confer-
ence championship in both
these divisions both years
that he has played.

Hatcher, a native of Co-
lumbus. Gax, has been an
outstanding athlete and stu-
dent while at Davidson. Play-
ing a relaxed style of ten-
nis, he seems to win his
matches with ease.

Davidson’s tennis squad is
hoping to continue its suc:
cessses of the last two sea.
sons. The Wildcat fuzzballers
have won the Conference
championship.both of the last
two years.

The prospects of another
strong team appear to. be
good with many lettermen re-
turning to the squad. In ad-
dition to Hatcher, several oth-
er conference champions will
be playing for this year's
team.

Parker said. ‘‘We have nev-
er beaten them, though last
year we should have. We
hope to do better now.”

Davidson has strong per-
sonnel returning to thts year’s
team from last season's
successful squad. Senior
Lowell Bryan, captain of the
team, will be defending his
Southern Conference champ-
ionship in the heavyweight
event. Colin Hudson, last
year's champion in the 115-
pound class, will wrestle in
the 123-pound event this sea-
son.

Dean Cromartie was the
137-pound conference run-
ner-up last year. This sea-
son he will participate in
the 130-pound division. Ker-
ry Keith, who finished sec-
ond in the conference in the
167-pound class, returns to
wrestle in that class. Keith
was injured in the West
Virginia football game and
will be out for the first
three matches of the sea-
son.

In addition to veterans re-
turning from last year's
team, the grapplers will be
using several freshmen. ‘‘The
freshman eligibility rule is a
big aid for a small school
like us. We have several
frosh who should really
help,’ Parker said.

Seven freshman will wres-
tle for the Wildcats. Frank
Rader and Jack Jacobs are
expected to be strong addi-
tions to the squad. Rader

EXPECTATIONS TOO GREAT?
Basketballers Hope To Settle All Doubt

By DON SEWELL
Sports Editor

Davidson's ‘Darlings of

start at the new basketball
season, playing two games
this weekend. The ‘Cats open
tonight in Johnston Gym
against Bucknell. Then to-
morrow, the Keydets of VMI

West Virginia's Mountain-
eers spoiled the Wildcat's
hopes for an upset by defeat-

football game of the season

with a 4-5 record for the sea-

was an outstanding wrestler
in the Philadelphia area.

Although this Wildcat
team is stronger and much
larger than last season’s,

match past records. The
overall wrestling strength
of the schools of the ‘area
has improved greatly.

Parker said, ‘“‘The Southern
Conference is a much better
balanced league than it has
been. There are several
teams, notably West Virginia
and William & Mary, that
are really strong from last
year."

Coach Lefty Driesell is
cautious when he speaks of
the team's chances in both
these games. Although near-
ly all pre-season observers
tab his team with greatness,
Driesell feets that the success
of the team depends on how
it reacts to its first few
games.

Bucknell will not be a
pushover for the Wilacats.
Three starters return from
last year’s team to give
them a firm base of talent.
Although they finished with
an unimpressive 11-11 rec-
ord fast season, the ex-
perience of the veterans
and the ability of sopho-
more Jim Wherry should

make Bucknell dangerous
this year.

Wherry. a 6-4 forward,
could possibly be the hest
sophomore in the country.
Driesell said. Bucknell: will
probably play a pressing de-
fense.

“They are a good. well-
coached. team. I know they
will be out to get us.’ Drie-

sell added. He said ‘that he
was not sure ‘yet who will
start for Davidson. ‘‘The type
of game that they play will
determine who plays for us.”
When asked how the ‘Cats
have developed through the
pre-season workouts, Drie-
. sell again became cautious
in his replies. “t can’t
really say how ‘we have de-

son.

When asked about the game
Coach Homer Smith said,
“We got beat, 35-0, and we
have no excuses. It "was not
a day when Davidson ftoot-
ball was embarrassed by the
effort."

The weather's being ex-
tremely cold, windy, and
muddy hindered the ‘Cats.

and before Davidson knew
It they were out of the
game.

There were several bad

taineer score. The ‘Cats
were then down 14-0 without
the WVU offense running a
single play.

West Virginia's size and
strength were not the prob
lem, Smith said. The ‘Cats
outgained them and made
more first downs. Gordon
Slade played part of the game
at quarterback and complet.
ed 13 of 20 passes in the
game. Smith said of Slade,
“We have long known of
Slade’s potential and he has
played in all games but one.
Next year he will be an ex-
perienced quarterback.”

For the season, the over-
alt’ highlight from the
coaches point of view was
the way the defense pulled
together in mid-season for
several strong perform-

ances. Smith said, “I think
the sophomores got two sea-
sons worth of experience.
Next year we will be a bet-
ter football team.”

West Virginia rolled by the

the finals of the Southern
Conference tournament on
Nov. 18 in Williamsburg.
Va.. to take their second
straight league champion-
ship.

The Mountaineers. paced
by experienced veterans
from last yvar’s champion

game from the start as they
jumped off to an early lead
and held the Wildcats score-
less.

The Davidson offensive at.
tack was kampered by the
loss of Alphonso Carillo. a
Richardson scholar from Ec-
uador, who did not see any
action due to a leg injury suf
fered in the East Carolina
game.

The Wildcats reached the
finals by crushing East Caro-

veloped until we play some
games and see how we re-
act.

VMI is also expected to be
very strong. They have four
starters back from last year’s
squad. The Wildcats only
beat the Keydets by two and
four points in their two
games last season.

John Kemper and ‘John
Mitchell are two high scor-
ing guards who will head
the VMI attack. Steve Pow-
ers, a 6.6 center was the
nation’s eighth leading re-
bounder last year. He will
give the Keydets, - not par-
ticularly tall overall, much
rebounding strength.

Pre-season polls pick the
Wildcats for the top ten in
the nation, but Driesell is not
convinced. ‘I think we are
overrated. It’s nice that they
think we're that good. We'll
{ry to prove that we are. but
I'm not sure that we are.”

The Wildcats will try to
play a fast. running type of
game this season. They have
worked hard on defense and
will probably use the press

requently. The basic defense

will be a man for man.
After the openers this
weekend, the Wildcats face
Furman back on the David-
son hardwoods. The Pur-
ple Paladins have always
been a strong opponent for
the ‘Cats.

Driesell said that he hopes
that the student body will
support the team this year.
“I think the last couple years
schoo! spirit has been down.”

Virginia In Today’s Opener

Davidson's swimming team

the ‘Catfish, said that the
Cavaliers were favored to
win the meet, but that he ex-
pected several events to be
very interesting.

The Davidson swimmers
have been working out
since Oct. 15 in prepara-
tion for the season. “We
have 4 really good team.
The freshmen should help

said.
