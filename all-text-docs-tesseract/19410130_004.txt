The ’Cats started off-fine, but influenza floored
them. To date they have yet to break into the con-
ference win column, dropping games to a hot Duke
team, then a close one to State, and finally losing to
an improved bunch of Gamecocks from South Carolina.

Feuding and Drilling

Turning away from basketball to the diamond
world, we find a feud going on as to who is to be the
highest paid pitcher in history. Before things clear
up Bobby Feller or Bobo. Newsdme will make around
40°g’s straight salary. Whoever cooked that feud up
must have had the welfare of the two hurlers in mind,
since thirty grand is more than any pitcher has ever
been paid for five months chunking.

Speaking of the conscription, Hank Greenberg of
the Tigers and Morrie Arnovich of the Reds have been
selected for “Selective Service.” According to their

©draft boards both will trade bats for guns around June
1. Other top sport figures caught in the draft are Dan
Topping, backfield ace of the Brooklyn Dodgers pro
football team, and Dick Chapman, National Amateur
golf champ.

and held the Eagle's star, Earl Ruth, to 10:
