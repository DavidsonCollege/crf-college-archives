Loss On! Fluke Play

Furman Freshmen Win in Final
Minute of Play

While Coach Younger’s first stringers
were outplaying and losing on a fluke to
V. P. I. at Blacksburg last Saturday, the
Red and Black Wildkittens were dupli-
cating the act on Davidson’s new ath-
letic field by outplaying and losing to
the Furman Freshmen their first inter-
collegiate game. The game should have
been 14 to 14 tie, ended on the field a
0 to o draw, and was finally decided a
2 to 0 victory for Furman, when Referce
Bethel changed his decision.

Soth teams had excellent opportunities
to score two touchdowns, but weakened
in the shadow of the goal and lost the
ball on downs. In the final minutes of
play Sapp, of Davidson, grounded the
ball illegally on an attempted forward
pass, after missing a bad pass from cen-
ter and failing to punt, for which David-
son was penalized half the distance to
the goal. Sapp then kicked to safety

»and the game ended o to 0. Referee
3ethel, however, later ruled that an in-
completed pass from behind the goal
line was a safety and Furman won the
game 2too, As the decision now stands
the Furman Freshmen are victors by a
sinall majority, but the finaluling has
not been made and it nay wtimately de-
velop that the game was a draw.

The game was hard-fought and ex-
citing throughout. The Davidson Fresh-

defensive tightened in the
second half and the contest developed
into a punting duel, Furman getting the
better of the affair. After several ex-
changes Hewlett fumbled one of Arm-
strong’s long ones and Woodward re-
covered for Furman on Davidson's 40-
yard line. The Furman boys launched
their hardest offensive at this point and
advanced the ball to Davidson’s two-
yard line where they lost on downs. At
this point the mixup came over the un-:
usual play pulled by Sapp and immedi-
ately afterwards the game ended with
the ball in Furman’s possession on the
| 40-yard line, Woodward being downed
in his tracks after receiving a 50-yard
punt.

Sapp was in rare form throughout the |
game, and seemed able to clip off-:a nice |
gain at will. Shelton, Varnedoe and}
| Johnson were playing a great defensive
|game, Varnedoe and Shelton breaking |
through on several occasions. Arm-_
| strong, Beasley and Kerr were perform- |
| ing nicely for the visitors. The Red and
| Black Freshmen showed the results of
| good coaching, but were unable to de-!|
| liver in tight places... The Furman Fresh- |
,men put up a scrappy fight and with a)
| little more experience several of the men
will be good material for next year’s |
varsity.

“Davidson surprised the football world
last year by holding V. P. I., one of the
strongest teams in the South to a tie.

the performance of the Wildcats yester-

GRADUATE STUDENT IS MIN-
ISTERIAL SPEAKER

On Sunday afternoon the Ministerial Band
was addressed by Joe Walker. His subject
was The Ministerial Band and Its Relation
to Campus Life. He first took up the pas-
sage in Luke which says that the kingdom of
God “is like leaven, which a woman took
and hid in three measures of meal, till the
whole was leavened.” He showed Christ's
conception of the kingdom of God. He then
took the truth which was brought out and ap-
‘plied it to campus life.
