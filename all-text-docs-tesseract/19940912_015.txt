We've got Dallas Cowboy fans

By Mike Wang

& Dave Dwyer
The Washington Redskins.
The San Francisco 49ers. The AFC,
Even the Carolina Panthers. What
do all of these teams have in com-
mon? Simple. None will ever
achieve the famed glory of a cer-
tain team, from a certain state,
whose helmet has a certain star,

and whose stadium has a certain”

hole so that God himself can look
in a watch his team play.

Arrogant, you say? Ridicu-
lous? Ignorant? Maybe, but we
won’t stoop to that level. We’re
here, as part of your $23,000 tu-
ition, to educate you on the Dallas
Cowboys, in the case that you’ve
been living under a rock for the
past thirty-four years (or in Wash-
ington, for that matter). We will be
providing weekly updates and pre-
dictions, even though they’re re-
ally unnecessary because the win-
ner of Super Bowl XXIX is al-
ready a foregone conclusion.
Hopefully, our insight will spark
some interest in the upcoming sea-
son, which basically an eighteen
week coronation period for “da
Boys” down in Irving.

By the time you have read
this, the Cowboys have amassed a
record of 2-0, having stomped Pitts-
burgh 26-9 at Three Rivers and the
Houston Oilers 24-3. The next
victim is the Detroit Lions, who in

fs ace

1993 shuffled quarterbacking du-
ties between perennial All-Pros
Erik Kramer, Rodney Peete, and
Andre Ware. OK they have Pro
Bowler Barry Sanders, buthe can’t
carry an offense and he doesn’t
play defense. Our prediction: Dal-
las 32-12.

Because this is our inaugural
column, we will not enlighten you
this week on various players or
team concerns. However, look for
upcoming features as we sift
through coach Barry Switzer’s mail
and trash, and personally order the
1995 championship rings. We’ll
conclude with auseless trivia ques-
tion: What college did reserve
safety Kenny “the Shark” Gant
attend? Answer next week.

Soccer celebrates conference victory

Soccer continued from page 14

game and went on to snatched the
victory.

“This game was aturning point
for us,” says Lombard. She said
that the team was having a “down
season” due to a lack of both con-
fidence and healthy players. Now,
however, almost everyone who was
sick or injured is once again play-
ing, and after finally scoring some
goals, the Wildcats have gained
the confidence they needed to con-

tinue winning.

Women’s soccer Coach Kevin

Hundley was both pleased and ex-
cited with his team’s win over
Georgia Southern. Having a 1-0
conference record is an excellent
start and should set the Wildcats
up for an outstanding showing in
the Southern Conference tourna-
ment in November.

With their first conference vic-
tory and a good deal of confidence
under their belt, the women’s soc-
cer team gears up for its next game
next Saturday, when the Wildcats
will take on another conference
rival, UNC-Greensboro, in what
will be a heated contest.
