Kruse’s Cubby
Wildcat pride}

By MICHAEL Kruse
Sports Editor

SinceI came to Davidson three-
plus semesters ago, I have used my
posts as sports editor and DCTV
Sportscenter co-host to champion
increased support for our Wildcats.

Evidently though, my efforts to
this point have been insufficient, my
cries heard by few, for the invisible
man is still Davidson’s most promi-
nent spectator.

To tell you the truth, my hope
and inspiration was beginning to dim.

In the heart of ACC country (or
so the Observer seems to think),
where the Carolinas, the Dukes, and
the Wakes are lords of all they sur-
vey, how could teeny Davidson even
begin to expect fan adoration?

With the Hornets and the Pan-
thers (and you know how I feel about
the Panthers) hailed as local royalty,
how could teeny Davidson even be-
gin to expect fans period?

But three people raised my spir-
its in the last two weeks by writing
opinion pieces to the Davidsonian.

Two fine, upstanding students,
Josh Roberts and Marian
‘Woodworth, and one fine, upstand-
ing alum, Bill Ford ‘65, wrote ar-
ticles calling for students to abandon
their study hovels, poke their heads
out into the real world, and head
down to Belk Arena. -

“Tam very concerned now about
the lack of student support as well as
the general fan support,” wrote Ford,
a Georgian.

“Knowing the academic rigors,
Istill see no reason why a majority of
the student body cannot walk across
campus and remain in a seat for two
hours thirteen times a year... Davidson
College is not a household name, and
one way we get our name in front of
the public is through athletics.”

Mr. Ford, I salute you. You are
what every Davidson grad should
be.

Marian chimedin, saying, “Josh
said it last week. Mike and Dan and
Aaron talk about it on TV - the pa-
thetic attendance levels have got to
improve.

“Tt’s funny that people who
spend a few hours in class and then
have an enitre afternoon free can’t
seem to find the hour-and-a-bit of
time needed to watch some or all of
one of these games,” added Marian,
who, by the way, gets bonus points.
for mentioning my name.

“What do you do all day?” she
asked, sounding delightfully sassy.

Josh, Marian, Mr. Ford, thank
you for reassuring me that there are
indeed people out there who care.

But the painful truth is that,
while they are not alone, Josh,
Marian, and Mr. Ford are still part of
a minority, suppressed by a disturb-
ingly apathetic majority.

“We love playing at home, but
it’s nice to play on the road,” said
freshman sensation Jen O’Brien last
week. “Other places are packed even
for our games and they get a pretty
good showing. I mean, they’ re cheer-
ing for the other team, but we can still
hear the noise.”

The women’s basketball team
likes playing on the road, folks, be-
cause there is noise. Jeers and verbal
barbs from rowdy fans? Please.

Taking time out once or twice a
week to go and cheer for your class-
mates won’t irreversibly crush your
GPA’s will to live and kill your ca-
reer before it ever begins.

-Call it a study break, if you
must. I don’t care what you call it.
Just come. Just live.

DAVIDSON, Feb. 10 - The
men’s basketball team humbled East

Tenn. St.
in Belk Arena

in a perfor-
mance strikingly similar to those of
last year’s Southern Conference un-
beatable.

Frenzied defensive pressure led
to easy and frighteningly efficient
offense for the Wildcats (14-9, 7-4
SC), who seem to be peeking at just
the right time with the conference
tournament at the Greensboro Coli-
seum now two weeks away.

“T think we’ ve grown and got-
ten better and better,” said coach
Bob McKillop after the relatively
relaxing outing. “Our defense has
upped the ante every time we’ve
been out, we’ re getting a great flow,
feeling good about each other, and
our rhythm is good. I thought we
executed so very well.”

The game itself was. ridicu-
lously lopsided, as evidenced by
the 72-27 and 91-36 Wildcat leads,
but it showed the team and its fans
the kind of precise and energized
effort needed to avenge last year’s
tournament collapse.

And even if it was against the -

last-place Bucs (7-17, 2-10), the
victory moreover demonstrated that
this year’s squad is entirely capable
of putting forth that necessary ef-
fort and winning its way into the
Field of 64 with a ease tourney
triumph.

Coach McKillop preaches de-
fense, and the 50-point win was a
work of art.

Wildcats trounce Bucs in home rout

Davidson stifled the Bucs,
holding them to anemic 22.6%
shooting in the first half and 30.8%
overall. :

The Bucs - whose two confer-

,ence wins have come against the

top two teams - finished with more
turnovers (21) than baskets (16) and
managed only seven assists.

“The defense was, from start to
finish, as good as it’s ever been in
this building,” said McKillop. “Ev-

ery pass, every catch, every look-

became a difficult job for ETSU.”

The bench also played a cru-
cial role, something which will pay
dividends come tourney time in the
form of rested legs.

No starter played more than 23
minutes and the team’s two leading
scorers came off the bench, Davor
Halbauer with a career-best 18 and
David Burns with 16. Billy
Armstrong also had one of his best
ever outings, notching eight points
and five assists in 18 minutes. _,

The usual big guns of Narcisse
Ewodo, Landry Kosmalski, and

' Mark Donnelly played only 59 min-

utes altogether, scoring 15, 11, and
10, respectively.

“We didn’t do anything,” said
ETSU coach Ed DeChellis. “We
didn’t compete. They did whatever
they wanted to us all night long.
When we’re bad, we’re very bad.”

“That means so much that ev-
eryone took part,” noted McKillop.
“We didn’t get 33 great minutes and
seven mediocre minutes. We got

‘40 great minutes tonight.”

“Davidson is capable of win-
ning: the tournament,” added
DeChellis. “They were kind of
stung last year and I think ois team
is on a little bit of a mission.’

DAVIDSON, Feb.11 - Before
Western Carolina arrived at Belk
Arena on Tuesday, they suffered an
80-66 defeat to conference leader

Furman. In
that game,
head coach

Gary Peters
was ejected for throwing a chair
onto the court.

The Southern Conference rep-
rimanded Peters for his actions, sus-
pending him for Monday’s contest.
Perhaps he knew what was tocome,
as the women’s basketball team (13-
8, 5-5 SC) held Western (9-12, 3-7)
to just 12 first-half points in a 77-52
victory.

“It was nice to just win con-
vincingly for a change,” said head
coach John Filar. “We needed a big
win tonight going into the road
games this weekend.”

Tuesday’s game was somewhat
of an abberation - six of Davidson’s
previous seven games had come
down to the final two minutes.

On this night, however, there

were to be no close finishes. The
Wildcats stormed out of the gates,
building an early 9-3 advantage on
solid passing and defensive re-
bounding.

Davidson held Western to mis-
erable 20% shooting and forced 17
turnovers in the first 20 minutes.

The second half belonged to
the reserves, in particular Danielle
Mall. After the starters built con-
vincing 58-20 lead with eleven min-
utes remaining, Filar cleared his
bench.

Mall took over, hitting three
baskets from beyond the arc.

“Sometimes I have the green
light and I’m afraid to shoot, but
tonight I just had the shots falling,”
said Mall, who finished with a ca-
reer-high 12 points to go along with
five rebounds.

Katy Kamp added 12: off the
bench, while Kerry Brown scored
eight. Carolyn Kirsch pitched in a
game-high 13. Western was paced
by Pam Owens (12).

Karen Mason, the conference’s
scoring leader, had nine before foul-
ing out at the beginning of the sec-
ond half.

With seven points tonight in Chattanooga, Carolyn Kirsch (above)
will become Davidson’s all-time leading scorer in women’s hoops.

‘Single helps a N CAA soccer Final Four to Charlotte

By MICHAEL KRUSE
Sports Editor

Davidson has again landed the
NCAA soccer Final Four, returning
the event to where it first hurdled
into the national spotlight some five
years ago.

Along with UNC Charlotte,
Davidson will host college soccer’s
postseason party at Ericsson Sta-
dium in 1999 and 2000.

_Charlotte’s bid - presented by
Davidson athletic director Jim
Murphy, Davidson men’s soccer
coach Charlie Slagle, UNCC ath-
letic director Judy Rose, and Rich

Scheubrooks of the Charlotte Sports
Commission two weeks ago in
Tuscon, Ariz. - bettered that of Dal-
las, Richmond, Va., and Sacra-
mento, Calif., the NCAA announced
last Monday.

The tournament has tentatively
scheduled a Thursday-Saturday for-
mat instead of its customary Fri-
day-Sunday setup due to a potential
conflict with the Carolina Panthers.
Dates are Dec. 9 and 11 in 1999 and
Dec. 7 and 9 in 2000.

“This is another feather in the
cap for Charlotte and its corporate
community,” Murphy saidina press
release. “What this soccer champi-

onship does is demonstrate once
again that Charlotte has become a
national forum for athletics, both
professional and collegiate.”

“We (Davidson and UNCC)
were able to offer what I believe is
the best stadium in the world to
showcase college soccer’s premier
event,” added Slagle.

Davidson hosted the soccer
Final Four at Richardson Field from
1992-94, shattering attendance
records every year.

The two-day tournament which
had drawn just 6,128 total fans the
year before in Tampa exploded in
its tenure at Davidson.

Richardson attracted 16,378 in
1992, 20,812 in 1993, and 23,857 in
1994.

Richmond’s 22,000-seat facil-
ity sold out in 1995 and 1996, con-
vincing the NCAA that further
growth was a possibility and a wise
financial move.

Ericsson’s lower bowl can seat
up to 33,000 and the entire state-of-
the-art stadium has 72,500 seats.

“The possibility of growth is
obviously there,” said Slagle, who
miraculously led the Wildcats to
the Final Four in 1992. “The NCAA
won’t have to worry about running
out of seats - yet.”
