Netmen Sweep Florida, Win 6

By TOM COOK
Davidsonian Sports Writer
Picking up six victories
and only one loss through a
spring recess tour into Flor-
ida, the Davidson tennis
team, called by Coach Harry
Fogleman, “potentially the
best team since I have been
here,” ran its record to a
10-1 slate with Pfeiffer
College, their next foe.

Beginning the spring recess
with a match at Furman, the
Wildcats skunked the Purple
Paladins 9-0. Coach Fogleman
explained, “Furman is not up
to their usual team strength. In
other words, they're hurting.”
Stetson, another school without
any horses (just “‘Hatters’’), fell
9-0.

Hooking up with Rollins Col-

ee

a

lege. one of the biggest tennis
powers in the country,"’ accord-
ing to Coach Fogleman, David-
son suffered its only defeat to
date.

Splitting the singles matches
33 and the number two and
number three doubles matches,
the rains came, and the rubber
maich of the series, the num-
ber one doubles, was postponed
and finally played the next af-
ternoon' after Davidson had
beaten Hope College. whose
Flying Dutchmen were shot
down 8-1. A loss in the doubles
match to the Tars cost the ‘Cats
a victory.

In their third day at Winter
Park on the Rollins courts, the
Davidson netters rebounded to
defeat Columbia University 6-3
in a hard-fought match.

Moving on to Lakeland, the
netmen employed their manag-
er George Blount in the num-
ber six singies match. With
Blount dropping the only point,
Davidson slaughtered Florida
Southern.

After the script was repeated
against Florida Presbyterian in
St, Petersburg. Coach Fogle-
man recounted, ''The manager
decided to retire from active
duty and return to his manager-
ial duties.”

In their only match since the
break, the netmen journeyed to
North. Carolina State and trounc-
ed the Wolfpack 8-1. Taking all
six singles matches and two
doubles matches. Davidson lost
only the number one doubles.

Coach Fogleman. optimistic

about the season, commented.
“The trip to Florida did us a
lot of good. We are beg‘nning

to show our potential. There is '

going to bé some experiment-
ing with doubles combinations
because we have had our prob-
lems there.

“Bill Council is playing better
and Captain Bill Schutt looked
awful good against Staite. I
am real pleased with our sopho-
mores Esmond Phelps. Peter
Parrot and Geordie Mueller.

“We have two strong number
seven and number: e‘ght men
in sophomore Jimmy Davis and
junior Jeff Frank. A lot of our
success has been possible be-
cause theze boys. have been
able .to step in ,when others
colud not play.”

Trackmen Win One;

Prepare For Relays

By LARRY

_ Davidson’s tracksters outclassed Lenior Rhyne and
High Point College in a three-way meet last Tuesday
and have begun preparations for the News Piedmont.

Relays to be run tomorrow.

Wildcat captain Alan Turner
won three events and was an-
chor man for the winning relay
team in the meet which saw the
team score 81 points to Le.
noir Rhyne’s 54% and High
Point's 39%.

Turner anchored the 440 re
lay team and won the 100. 220,
and 220 low hurdles.

Bill Kendrick threw the jave-
lin 190° 11°" to take another first
place for the Wildcats.

John Barrow and Andy Little
took the top two positions in
the two mile run.

Denny Phillips and Ronnie

Reese ran one two in the 880.

The Wildcat track team will
spend the rest of the week get-
ting in shape for the News Pied
mont. Relays at Spartanburg.

Competing against: the Wild
cats are Wofford and Presby
terian.

Coach Heath Whittle ventured
to say that “We should do very-
well!"’ Davidson had no trouble
in disposing of Presbyterian
last year, and since track at!
Wofford has just started grew-
ing, Davidson may be able to
sweep the field.

The only dark cloud cast on |
Davidson's chances is that Dav-|
id Brown. ivho competes in five
events, will not be able to play
due to a pulled muscle.

On the 24th of. this month
Davidson will be host to the |
ninth annual Davidson College:
Relays. Fifteen colleges will
participate in the relays which >

Davidson has won all six years.

Slow. starting sophomore Skip
Waite, with a suddenly potent
bat, has taken over the catch-
ing duties from junior Jim Ter-
ry. Although Waite has little
experience, he is fast learning
the receiving trade, .

Shortstop, a most vital posi-

i tion to any team, has also been
plagued with inexperience. Ron-

nie Stone has had trouble ad-
justing to this key spot. Jim
Hyder has been moved to
shortstop and has responded
with his usual consistent and
dependable performance.

When Hyder plays short. Jake
Jacobson will handle the second
sack.

Pitching is a spot at which
little shifting can be done. and
little relief is in sight. Howard
Bryan, captain of the team and
ace of the staff. is pitching bril-
Nant ‘ball and should continue
to do so the remainder of the
year.

After Bryan the tempo falls
off with the remainder of the
starting chores resting on Dick
Suyder, senior lefties Dave
Johnson and Ronnie “Turkey”
Rudolph, and soph Gene Ben-
nett.

Snyder. probably the finest
outfielder to. attend Davidson in
many years, has been forced in-
to mound duty by the loss of
key players to Hetzel’s ‘‘money-
maker's,”

The remainder of the team
seems fairly well set. At first-
base Claude Owen is going
against righthanders and Sonny
Graves against lefties.

In the outfield strong-hitting
senior Lance Walker handles
left. Snyder plays center, and
soph Bryant Hinnant covers
right.

"Cats Test Three Foes

in Baseball Next Week

Davidson's baseball squad faces a full schedule
next week with five games in the six-day period. All
of the games willbe played at home. The ’Cats open
with Pfeiffer Monday, have a doubleheader with
West Virginia Wednesday, and finish out the week
with a Friday-Saturday series against East Carolina.

Stevens pointed out

that these three teams

would provide plenty of tough competition for his

Wildcats. The ’Cats have

When asked if EC would be able to repeat its
previous performance, Stevens tersely replied, “I

hope not.”
He also pointed out

that West Virginia has a

“tremendous team” and is favored to win the con-

again this spring.

Stevens has not picked his pitchers for any of
the games except the West Virginia doubleheader
in which Howard Bryan and Dave Johnson will start.
