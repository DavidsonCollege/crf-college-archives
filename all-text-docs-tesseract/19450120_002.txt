Au revoir...

Another semester draws to a élose and
another graduating class prepares to leave.
Five more boys have survived to the énd
of the stormy way of wartime college
work,
real battles are in progress, for here one
only feels the effect of outside turmoil.

With them go the best wishes of all
they leave behind in the student body and
faculty. We cannot wish them smooth-
sailing or paths without stones. Every-
one realized that success in life means fac-
ing reality, but today reality is harsh and
unpleasant. We would rather wish them
the courage to be brave no matter what
may be the road they follow, no matter
what the hardships of life may impose. ~_

Above all the wishes for them we have
this prayer: That the spiritual values
which have been so central in their lives
here around which all college life Tyne-
tions, may be their support as they enter
their new life and remain with them
through all its extent. :

The end of college life has always
signified the opening of a new, more
mature phase of life. For many it is
the first time they are ‘on their own”,
taking their place in society as contribut-
ing citizens. For others it is the time of
beginning of more serious advanced pro-
fessional study. Whatever course the
graduate may pursue they have behind’
them all the advantages of an education.
at Davidson.

These, however, are not: the only men
who are making their exit from David-
son. Undergraduates are constantly find-
ing it necessary to discontinue their edu-
gation because of the demands made by
military operations. To these men who
have gone or who expect to leave soon
we can only express our regret that they
have not been able to continue their col-
lege.

‘It is our sincere hope that all of these
men will look on this not as an end of

this education, but merely the continua-
tion of it. Men of these days and times
need a full college education in order to
meet the problems of life with the greatest
SUCCESS. The yeags of peace will bring
with them all the promise of a new era.
When all this has come to pass it is our
sincere desire to see all of the men who
possibly can return to finish what they
started. May the Sons of Davidson who
leave now remember the days they spent
here with the fullest pleasure. May
whatever experience they have had here
be, used to the best advantage possible.
May life give them the fullest it-has to
offer.

So to thes graduates we say farewell,
and to the other men who leave, good-
bye until we meet again at Davidson.

Dance Regulations .. .

PRO...

For a long time the students at Davidson have
had a great deal of difficulty in finding rooms for
dates at dances and functions, and the Faculty
Social Committee has taken. steps to remedy this
situation. They have made’ arrangements which
will permit girls to be comfortably lodged in one
of the dormitories at a price. The
Committee is to be congratulated upon recognizing
this problem and trying’ to help the students dur-
ing the coming dances.

reasonable

The forthcoming regulations which are to be
in effect at Mid-Winters rather strict in
comparison with past social rules, but the Faculty
is trying to find a suitable program of rules and
to improve the standard of our dances. The Mid-
winter’s rules are to be tried with a view of find-
ing the best way to regulate social functions, and
the standards set have been compared with those
of other colleges and are very similar to them.

seems

Instead -of complaining about the rules and
trying to get away with breaking them, the student
body will‘do much toward increasing the chances
of obtaining more liberal regulations in the fu-
ture if they cooperate with the Administration in
its plans for the dances in February.

CONT seen:

At a recent meeting of the Faculty Social
Committee it was decided that if Mid-winters this
year were to be held on the. campus, certain regu-
lations concerning these dances had to be made.

Naturally we have no objection to -the rule
that would open Duke dormitory to the visiting
girls. There has long been a need’ for such a plice
in Davidson as there has always been considerable
inconvenience in various

securing rooms in the

homes on and off the campus.

However at this same meeting a regulation
was proposed that would require all the girls to
be in the dormitory one half an hour after a dance
on Saturday night.

In General Regulations, Section Eight it is
thus stated: “Young men and young women are
expected to conduct themselves in social relation-

‘v ships in such a manner as not to reflect discredit

upon themselves or upon the college.” Obviously
the faculty considers the present student body
incapable of living’ up to this regulation as former
Davidson students have done. It seems to reflect
on the student body when the faculty finds it
imperative to institute a stricter rule which here-
to-fore has not been necessary.

The coming Mid-Winters dance, to be held
Saturday, February tenth, will be the biggest col-
lege function of the year; it should” be the hap-
piest time as it has been in previous years. We
hardly see how this could be possible with the re-

sentment that would be aroused by these unjust
restrictions.

Not’ only because these regulations are unfair,
undemocratic and childish, but also because it is
the only /big social event held at Davidson during
the entire college year, we appeal to the fair-
mindedness of the Faculty Social Committee to
reject such dictatoral controls.

‘What About
It?

This article was found on the ste}
of the
little

Davidson office. So with a

correction and reediting, we
are publishing it. There was neither
title nor name on it so the idenity
of the person who wrote it is un-
known.

“There™ts a school called The
Citadel, Oh yes, it is a good schcol,
but what the boys go through is
something for the books. We are
told the other day, / by one of them,
about an incident that happened
not so very long ago.

For weeks the student council had
been planning for a big dance.- It
was to be the biggest event of the
year. Several bands were considered
and then one was chosen from a
near-by town. It was to be held in

one would see boys

thumbing their address books, in
hopes of finding a girl who was the
better of the lot. For it was an honor
for a. girl to be asked to this par-
ticular dance and the boys wanted
to make sure that this honor was
bestowed on the best girl he could
find. Letters written,

were snap-

shots were once more pulled out
and shown to admiring males, and
plans were made for an evening
that they thought was going to be
a so-called “night to remember”.

then the problem? There would

up of mostly first-termers, they
were uncapable of handling them-

conveniently placed a time limit on

that nothing like that happens here
at Davidson?

It was a few nights before Christ-
mas eve and Joe was in a good

mood. But on this night he

was
minus a date. One of his pals, who
hated to see him in this predica-
ment, suggested a girl who he knew.
After a lengthy description Joe con*
sented to go. The hitch was that
his pal was unable to bring him
home, for he was going to a dance.
But he was told, that there were
busses that ran out to that part of
town,

Iinally they arrived at the girl's
house and entered. While being in-
troduced to the family, a tall, ‘wil-

Shakespeare), ‘her skin white as a
dove (is a dove white?), and—well
—she was a nice looking girl. Our
Joe's friend left and they were alone,
Whether to go to.a movie or not
was then the question? But after
a few minutes of debate they de-
cided to stay home and look at the
Christmas tree. A few records and
they were dancing on the smooth
floor, singing to each other, Then,
to the icebox where they got some
cookies and ice-cream. At this time
he looked at his watch and noticed
that it was time to leave, Joe went
to the ‘phone and inquired of the
bus company when the busses quit
ah yin that part,.of the city. He
was promptly told that the busses
were just driving into the garage.
Well, there was always a taxi, But
to no avail, even they had gone to
bed. There he was stranded with a
girl and no way to get home. He was
beginning to get worried. Finally
the girl thought of calling the par-
ents of the girl whom his pal had
dated, leaving word for him to call
back for our friend. After this was
done, they settled into the deep sofa
and looked at the family-album.

A few hours later his date com-
plained that she was sleepy. He be-
ing gallant suggested that she go to
bed and that he would be perfectly
comfortable reading a magazine un-
til his friend came. Much to his sur-
prise, she accepted this offer; alone.

‘The magazine proved fruitless. All

of the stories were about soldiers
returning from war to their wives,
who wore skirts and sweaters and
danced to Will Bradely, Benny
Goodman, and Glen Miller when
they left for the service. But now
that they had come home their Wives
had changed to up-sweep hair-dos,
intellectual readings, and Beethoven
and Straus. Result? He never got
to finish the story for some of her
family walked in. To be more speci-
fic, it was her brother and sister
who had been to the same dance
that his friend. The reader inust
realize that this was a very embar-
assing moment: for him, Here these
people walked in and found a er-
fect stranger sitting in their house
reading a magazine. Their eyes were
very skeptical as Joe introduced
himself to the assembled group be-
fore him. They stumbled through
a stinted conversation and during:
a moment of silence the door- bell
rang. His friend had finally come,

While riding home he thought
over in his mind the things that
had happened to hin during the
night. It was a night to remember.

But don’t laugh for “This Might
Be You.”
