THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1992

By Tony Tuntasit

I was Standing in a bookstore
in Thailand, perusing through a
magazine trying to look “cool,”
when I was stunned by a very
attractive female who was also
perusing through a magazine try-
ing her best to look “cool,” as
well. She was so “cool” that I
relieved myself of all inhibitions
and attempted to whisk her off
her feet with a spontaneous, in-
sightful and really “cool” ... pick
up line. For a little background,
my experience with “pick up

I.” I have never
been able to execute “pickup
lines” with a straight face,
For example, the Ricardo
Montabon/James Bond type
suaveness that you’re supposed
tohave when you say “Baby, your

shall I say, “coo

business” usually becomes some
Gilligan-like saying, such as,
“Baby, do you know that sugar is
the main export of Western Tan-

So I approached her with
charm, class and a pocket full of
(Kryptonite) Fruity Mint Certs
and tried to think of anything to
say. Enlightened by a novel, in-
genious, and solitary “pick up
line,” I approached her and was
supposed to say: “Oh, I see you’re
reading (name of magazine)” or

tive, eh? call

However, something was lost
in the translation and in the course
of my picking up, I said (in Thai,
of course), “Oh, I see you read.”
After seconds of intense silence, I
suddenly realized my apocalyp-
tic error. Instead of the “cool”
pickup line I was supposed to
deliver, I made a pseudo-social
commentary on literacy. Thus, I
strolled, meandered, OK, I flat
out ran to the comforts of my
friends who seemed to consider
the event quite funny, hilarious,
and worthy of hourly recollec-
tion,

Pick up lines at Davidson
seem to be more creative, of

mind you. When bored, I suggest

course. We’re all quite smart, .

you use the following lines to in-
troduce yourself to the diversity

the South.

1, Hi, where are you from?
(Very simple, concise but boring.)
Try this, instead.

-2. Hey, those 12 pound books
you’re carrying for Humes really
build BIG biceps.

3. Can I treat you to dinner at
the Student Union. I have 100
bonus bucks on my CAT card?

4. Is that what your S.A.T.
score was? I nearly doubled it!

5.:-You know the wrinkles un-
der your eyes from the six hours of
Philosophy reading really give you
that Marlon Brando look!

If all else fails try this:

6. Hi! I’m cool, I drink beer.

A major cause for celebration
among Davidson Freshmen is re-
membering somebody’s name.
Usually, there is a round of high
fives, cheers, and butt slapping
when a name correctly leaves the
realm of the collective subcon-
scious, follows some neural syn-
apse and is uttered out of the oral
cavity. (The oral cavity is your

reading this.)

- Names and faces are hurled at
you at astonishing rates, There are
names you try to avoid, faces that
leave residual images on your cor-

using “cool” pick up line number

However, I leave you with a
final thought... . The name game
can really backfire if not handled
with care. I recall the following
instance which really did happen
at the Union Store.

Him: Hey! You’re from
Zionsville, Indiana, right?

Her: Yeah!

Him: . You’ve got the 8:30
Calculus Class with Smith, the
12:30 Advanced Polyscience Lab,
and Anthropology 188, right?

Her: Yeah!

Him: It’s Natasha Mish

Her: It’s Joan!
Honestly, good luck.

demands. SMUD is also investing in new technologies to create a

diverse power base.

While renewable power has its disadvantages for landlocked, river-
free, windless, constantly dark parts of the country, the rest of the nation
can enjoy considerable gains without a loss in our standard of living. By
reducing our reliance on foreign oil and uranium deposits, we’ ll actually
become stronger and more independent of the whims of the international
marketplace. We won’t have to drill in the Alaskan National Wildlife

Refuge, either. Sorry, George.

~) Deep Thoughts: Kirby Shealy
Coles' Lecture Brings Memories

Dr. Robert Coles’s lecture last
Thursday evening reminded me of
a lesson taught to me by my high
school Chemistry teacher. Francis
Broadway was this man’s name,
and he had a unique approach to
his discipline.

For example, in addition to
the usual lab work and problem
solving common to most second-
ary school Chemistry curricula,
Broadway, who happened to be a
behemoth of a person, assigned us
to write a short story. The only
stipulation he attached to this most
unusual Chemistry exercise was
that the short story had to use the
Law of the Conservation: of En-
ergy as its theme.

As if creative writing weren’t
odd enough for a science class,
Broadway, who had become the
object of much ridicule by this
point in the year, next told us to
draw a picture that we thought
represented the poem
“Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll.

You can imagine our response. By
the end of the term, my entire class
thought Francis Broadway could
have done us all a favor by retiring
and spending the rest of his life
counting the raisins in his fruit
salad at one of those “special” hos-

pitals. Now I regard him as one of

the finest teachers I ever had.

Broadway’s lesson was
simple: don’t take any of this
Chemistry stuff at face value—
someone might come along one
day and figure out that our whole
way of looking at the science is
wrong. This idea is not so far-
fetched.

Consider the fact that youhave
never really seen an atom (unless
they’redoing thingsin Danal don’t
know about). Have you ever held a
polypeptide in your hand and pe-
rused its intricate surface with your
naked eyes? We really don’t know
what they look like— we’ve just
come up with an entire modelling
system to explain why they behave

the way they do. So far, thissystem
has been able to explain the way
we perceive atoms and molecules
to behave. But you never know
what we might discover tomor-
TOW...

Broadway’s lesson applies
equally well to all of academia. I
think he would agree with me that
we should take all of the facts we
are learning here with a measure of
skepticism, for who knows how
next week’ s revelation may change
our entire perspective on history,
art, philosophy, or science. Thus,
as Dr. Coles implied Thursday, it
is not what we know or even how
much we know that is ultimately
important.

The really valuable thing that
this school would like to teach us
(and that we should earnestly at-
tempt to learn) is the ability to
think and to make the kind of moral
decisions that make us good people
and the world we affect better for
our having been a.part of it.

College Scapegoated Fraternity

By Bryan Allison

Under the cloak of darkness
(better known as summer vaca-
tion), the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fra-
ternity was dealt a crushing blow-
a year-long suspension from
Patterson Court. Now while I am
not personally an SAE, I do con-
sider myself to be friends. with
some of them. That is the purpose
for my commentary. I feel the
punishment instigated was too
harsh.

What really irks me is the fact
that the school waited until after
we were gone to announce the sus-

pension. In my mind’s eye, I pic- -

ture a sort of demented scene from
The Wizard of Oz during that June
trustees’ meeting. I can see certain
deans who wrote certain biased
slander last year dancing around
singing, “Ding dong the hods are
dead! The wicked hods are dead!”

Now why do] feel the punish-
ment was too harsh? First, they
had already received their punish-
ment by Dean Terry, who at the
time said that the suggested two-
year sabbatical certain parties pro-
posed would slowly kill the frater-
nity. And a one-year suspension
doesh’t have a similar effect? The
reason for the added punishment
was disclosed as a pledge activity
in late April. lassume this “pledge
activity” is the traditional Milk of
Minerva trial that all SAEs every-

where experience. Was this truly
the “final straw” that necessitated
this more extreme punishment?

I may be naive, but I lived on
a hall with six SAE pledges last
year, and I do not recall hearing
aboutthis event in late April nordo
I remember anything out of the
norm. True it happened, but obvi-
ously it was quite discreet. Just
how hard were they looking? It
seems to me that unless I was com-
pletely out of it, the school had to
be looking pretty darn hard for
them to discover thisevent. Seems
kinda like a personal vendetta,
doesn’t it?

Ina letter to the editor I wrote
last year, l-implied that the school
was blaming the majority of its
problems on the SAEs as made
evident by the Select Committee’s
Report on Campus Intolerance. It
might as well have been titled
Davidson Good; SAE Bad. I pro-
pose that some of these gentlemen
take a road trip to any one of many
campuses ‘in the area. I suggest
they take a look at the fraternities
there and the pledging activities
that go on there.

I myself grew up in Texas
amidst the pledge horror stories
that seemed to go on every year at
the University of Texas- from guys
getting branded to guys getting
locked in car trunks filled with
beer or hard liquor and notallowed

to get out until they had finished.
There seemed to be at least one or
two pledge-related deaths every
year. My parents were not too
excited at first about me joining a
fraternity until I was able to dispel
the myth that fraternities were noth-
ing but a bunch of beer-guzzling,
skirt-chasing neanderthals.

The “unrest” that the SAEs
are guilty of here pales in compari-
son to what I have heard about
from my friends from high school.
Letme qualify this statement. Iam
not justifying some of the events
that happened here last year. Nor
am I saying that Davidson is any-
thing like a State U. I do think we
are different here in a lot of ways
from the typical college- we should
strive onward in pursuing what
sets us apart.

My pointis thata lot of people
on this campus need to lighten up.
Anal retentativeness is at an all-
time high right now. The handling
of this problem isa microcosm for
what is currently wrong with
Davidson.

After watching that humor-
ous anti-SAE “demonstration” that
transpired in front of the Com-
mons last year, my roommate and
I joked that we should get U2 to
come play a benefit concert.

I mean, they played benefits

The girl sees “the cheese” coming,
but like Indians running bulls off a
cliff (what?), the pursuer backs her
into a comer, and wets his finger.

_ He then rubs that wet finger along

the arm of the poor victim. Then
the line, “Let’s get you out of those
wet clothes.”

The third type of guy, and
really the scariest is “the
buttslapper.” Every guy knows

this one, though, only a few girls
know him. (He last hooked ) Of
course, he plays some manly sport
like football or rugby or table ten-
nis. He also listens to country
music, thinks you really spell
fantastik like that, and loves hunt-
ing. Given, he hangs out at the
Pub, shoots pool and absolutely
loves Budweiser.

- In fact, his entire life is one
giantBud commercial. He wears a
BUD hat, has BUD posters with
sexy women on his wall, and
memorized the entire BUD can.

(Why the hell is BUD in capitals?
Because this article is sinking into
the fourth pit of hell.) Oh,and he’s
called “the buttslapper” because
he loves to land a good square pat
on every male bum he passes,
which means he probably hasn’t
gotten any. play because he hasn’t
come out of the closet.

Alright, last guy, and then you
can get off the toilet. Basically, it’s
the rest of us boring schmucks who

don’t have any personality at all.
So there! See ya.
