bomb bay doors with two extended
fingers and hauled himself slowly,
painfully back into the fuselage of
the furiously burning plane. Realiz-

to avert tragedy, the young major
kicked the cravett cadet out into
space and bailed out himself. As
he passed down through the open
bomb bay doors a horrifying sight
was burned upon his brain: a para-
chute whose straps were inex-

Turnbull, ‘Jim Vann, and Easy
Rhodes heaving the discus. Buddy
Chandler, Bob Walker, Carl Eborn,
and Joe Richards are the heifties
in line to put the shot. Bill Robert-
son and Bill Walker seem to have
the javelin pretty well in hand.

With these as a nucleus,
Pete is forming a combination that
may bring some honors back to the

boys
