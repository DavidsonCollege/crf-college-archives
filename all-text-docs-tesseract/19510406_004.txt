THE DAVIDSONIAN

Exclusive Interview Lays Sordid Trail
Directly To Local Gambling Syndicate

In an exclusive interview with
Frank Costello, your Washington
correspondent gained valuable in-
formation relating to the preval-
ence of collegiate crime in North
Carolina. This report has been as
widely doubted as the Kinsey's and
just as avidly read. Up till now,
however, due to political pressure
from the godly as well as the un-
godly a virtual blanket of righteous
smog has cloaked the facts in the
swirl of the unmentionable, Con-
science, or whatever else psycho-
logists call parental repercussions,
won out and this interview is
being released.

Naturally in a publication of this
size and in order to give space to
other news of interest such as who
won the Nobel Peace Prize we are
limited to excerpts from the inter-
view. This interview was taken in
shorthand by our Washington Bu-
reau’s private secretary and trans-
lated into five different languages

In presenting the following dia-
logues we will refer to Mr. Cos-
tello as Frank and to the interview-

er as Int. The dialogues will be a
series of questions and answers
taken at random from the report.

Int: Mr. Costello—

Frank: Listen Buddy, don’t get
personal.

Int.: Who do you think you are,
Harry Truman?

Frank: Listen Bud, leave his
name out of this. Harrys a person-
al friend a mine.

Int.: Sorry, I'l! rephrase the
question. Once more—who do you
think you are the Secretary of the
Treasury?

Frank: Not so loud, he’s got
enough on me now without no
perjury charge.

Int.: Would you mind shedding
a little light on your alleged con-
nections in the State of North Ca-
rolina, particularly among colleges
and universities.

Frank: Well, you know how it
is. With the heat on and every-
body squawking about fixes there
ain't much doing. We’ve even had
trouble down there with people
trying to muscle in on the take.

Frinstance my southern director told
me. about somebody trying to run
a book in Davidson. It seems that
that territory ‘hadn't been too fruit-
ful until recently the ban on gamb-~
ling was lifted slightly. Now that
things are booming some foreigner
named Hugo or Adolph has got-
ten a race wire and is running a
parlay on the conference basket-
ball games. Just to show you we
don’t believe in force except in
tough cases T sent the college a
large donation to build a student
union. In that way nobody will
bother to go by this other guy’s
place and pretty soon he'll go out
of business. Of course the donation
was given in somebody else’s name
and we doubt that he'll deny it.

Int.: Mr. Costello how do you
manage to maintain headquarters
near colleges?

Frank: Most of these college
treasurers like to see us around.
We probably finance more educa-
tion and more government than in-
come taxes and the Duke endow-
ment. Frinstance, down there at
Davidson I got to know some
guy named Jackson—me and him
got together and I told him, “Cash
—that’s what I called him— “look-
a-here, you keep them preachers
off my neck and as far as money
is concerned I'll keep them off of
yours.” That worked all right until
the Student Council started some
kind of investigation. They almost
upset the apple cart until I had a
little -heart-to-heart talk with the
Bresident after which the case was
dropped. Now things are a_ little
more in the open and we're not
worried about that .portion of our
interprises at the moment.

The full report can be procured
by petitioning the executive com-
mittee or by contacting Frank Cos-
tello, whichever finds out who
wrote thin first.
