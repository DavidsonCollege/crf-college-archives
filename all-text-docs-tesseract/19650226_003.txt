‘MEANS BECOME ENDS’

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Buttrick Raps ‘Things’ |

By TED GLUSMAN
Davidsonion Feature Writer

Once again Davidson has en-:
‘joyed a visit from possibly the
most distinguished of its re-
gular visitors, Dr. George
Buttrick.

occurring during Freshman
Orientation.

Buttrick spoke first at Ves-
pers Sunday night, then. in
chapel Monday morning. His
topic Monday, which pretty well
summarized the topic of his
visit, was “What's the Matter
with Things?" He made three
main points, two in chapel and
Vespers, and one at the regular
coffee hour after chapel.

Air France Cancels:.

Chorus To Fly Saturn

Davidson's Male Chorus will
fly to Europe June 13 on a
Saturn Airways DC-7C instead
of an Air France jet as was
originally planned last fall.

Alumni director Bill Bon-
durant explained that Air
France had broken a contract
with the college late in Jan-
uary “for reasons of its own,”
making it too late for him to
charter dnother jet.

Bondurant described Saturn
as a “certified US supplemental
carrier” noting that it makes
regular trans-Alantic flights.

The DC-7C, a propeller-driven
airliner, seats fewer people
than the jet, but Bondurant said
said that this would make. his

job of filling it with alumni,
and students somewhat easier,

than he had originally expect-
ed.

Besides the Male Chorus, 30
alumni, and students have ask-
ed for places on the plane
and at least 60 more have ex-

Soprano

Evelyn McGarrity, mezzo-sop-
rano, be will presented in con-
cert at 8:15 p.m. March 4, in
Hodson Hall.

Miss McGarrity is a graduate
of the Curtis Institute of Music
and has served on the faculty
of Wesleyan College in Macon,
Ga., and the Opera Workshop
at Indiana University. At pre-
sent she is on the faculty of
Louisiana State University.

A winner of the 1957 Young
Artist Auditions of the Nation-
al Federation of Music Clubs,
she has toured the United States
with Gian-Carlo Menotti’s ‘The
Consul” and in Italy, on a Ful-
bright Scholarsh:p, she made a
highly successful debut as
Suzuki in “Madame Butterfly.”

Miss ‘McGarrity has made im-
portant solo appearances with
leading orchestras and choral
groups, including the Collegiate
Chorale under the direction of
Robert Shaw.

For her Davidson program
Miss McGarrity will sing a
group of Beethoven songs, art
songs by Richard Strauss,
Faure and Debussy, and selec-
tions by Vincent Persichetti
and Delius. The featured oper-

second was that things are
relative, and can be used for
good or evil. The third point
was that you should never treat
things as things!

Buttrick sums up his philo-
sophy on gadgets in a single
phrase, which forms the basis
for his whole theological sys-
tem. ‘There can be no progress
along the horizontal line," he
says, “in a world in which
every man. including the last
man, dies.’

Progress along the ‘‘horizon-
tal line’ is gadgetry and ¢ech-
nology. Man’s devotion to and

Those who attended the coffee
hour got an intimate glimpse
of Buttrick the man, comment-
ing on everything from. tele-
vision commercials (“They
pedal their spaghetti with

ianity (“I'm not a Christian-
there’s only been one-but I

and the second being ‘Men

combe proceeded to show what
each explanation leads to.
The latter theory, by doing
away with a creator ‘‘makes

audience by informing them
that the idea that “Man is

Founding Fathers, are all ob-

Soon after graduation in 1928,
Witt Hancock went ‘to work

several years in various AP

Hancock was sent to the

Moscow, Istanbul. Calcutta
and Iran were a ‘few of the

After the war, the picture

ters. When the office was. re-

familics.

In turn, the Hancock family
sent the portrait to Davidson,
where the young man had be-

Handbook Staff Named

The 1965 Whlidcat Handbook
will be much the same as it has
been for the past two years, ac-
cording to editor Britt Snider.

There will be a few minor

changes and a number of addi-
tions, but the format and the
outward appearance will remain
largely as it has been.

The miain addition to the
Handbook will be a larger quan-
tity of editorial comment on the

Our moral confusion is an- |

other problem tackled by New-
combe. Stating that ‘‘Morally
our menace lies in confusing
liberty with libertinism,” he
went on to say that if a society
falls below certain moral stand-
ards, “that society fails apart."
But it is said that human na

not change it, therefore what

are we to do to stop the moral |.

decay of our society?

The answer, according to
Newcombe is not to try to
“change” human nature, for
it is not a fixed thing, there-
for it can not be changed; but
we should try to steer it in
a worthwhile direction. This
direction is the upholding of
the Golden Rule in its true
sense.

This is to “love every hu-
man being whether you like
him or not," and to ‘Do what
you do to him for his own
good.” Thus we can “influence”

A short new section on the:

new members of the faculty will
cover what they have done, their
qualifications, and their degrees.

Another section, Snider said,
will include all statistics on the

new Freshman Class: the num
ber of class presidents, scholar-
ship winners, letters won, and
other similar lists of informa.
tion. This profile will be much
the same as the one put. out by
the Admissions Office each year.

The 1965 Handbook will again
come out in two. editions one
without room numbers. and one
with room numbers. “It takes a
litle more money,” Snider stat-
ed. “but it is more than worth
it."

Pictures of the student body
officers and college officials will
be action rather than posed head
shots of the past. Another pro
jected change will be the re:
placement of the cartoons which
separate the sections by photo
graphs.

The staff besides Snider will-
be Bill McGuire, business man

ager with Paul Marion, Wayne

Mangum, Thom Blair, John Cal
lender. Gary DeVane, Johnny
Jeter, Richard Little, and John
Sartorious as section editors.

New Hall Counselor
Selections Due Soon

Hall connselors for the year 1965-66 will be an-

nounced early next month, reports Dean of Stu-
dents Richard C. Burts, Jr.

Counselors are chosen from rising seniors who
have served this year as hall counselors, and from
a group of well-qualified rising Juniors and seniors
who have been asked by the Dean of Students to
consider the job.

Interested students should contact the Dean of
Students office.

Dean Burts commented that “Hall counselors
have an opportunity for leadership and responsibil-
ity.” Pay for the year is one-half room rent.

On April a training period will be held for the
new counselors. A preview of the role of hall coun-
selor will be given and discussed by the Dean of
Students, Supervisor of Dormitories, College Chap-
lain, Counseling Office, and Freshman Advisor.

Snider praised his staff, saying,
“YT just gave them their assign-
ments to work on, and they've
done them, If they come up with
any good ideas, and they have,
they'll be used.”

The only problem encountered
so far this. year has been that
of enough money. Last year's
handbook ran in the red, and
this year’s edition may need to
have more funds from the col
lege.

Snider concluded by saying.
“I don’t anticipate arly prob
lems. If the. guys keep getting

Davidson's International Re-

sor an on-campus session of
Great Decisions. . .1965, an an-
nual program on eight different
foreign policy topics, prepared
by the Foreign Policy Associ-
ation.

The program will run for a-
bout eight weeks, with at least
one mecting per week. Among
the topics to be discussed are,
“Red China-Menace or Paper
Tiger?’’, and ‘‘Vietnam—Is Vic-
tory Possible?"’

Jim Brindell, IRC President,
said the program is designed
“to make the individual more

j aware .of the issues involved

iin various critical areas of U.S.

{the discussion format allowed

had expressed an interest in
the program, but he was un-
sure as to the final number
of participations. “A small

YRC Squeiches Coup

Davidson’s Young Republicans, in
the midst of a breech caused by inci-
dents at the recent State Convention,
anticipate a more reserved atmosphere
at their March 3 meeting.

Joe Beard, a member

conservative element, said this week:
“{ plan to stay in my room during the
meeting. In other words, I do not plan

to attend.”

In way of an explanation for his ac-
tion, Beard said, “A certain conflict be-
tween the president and me, begun at
the convention, would make my pres-
ence at the meeting detrimental to the
best interests of the club.

Beard explained the origin of the

“conflict” by stating that,

two weeks before the convention, had
agreed to support my candidacy for dis-
trict liason officer. At the convention

he decided that he did
support the same.

“After he had spoken to Hal Clark,
who had also previously assured me of
his support,-Hal and he informed me of
Hal’s candidacy. I consider Mr. Edgar’s

i action to be detrimental to the unity of

the club.”
