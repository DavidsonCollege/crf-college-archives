KATHERINE WHITNEY is the epitome of contenttation as she

focuses in on the bullseye. The rifle team is shooting well and
should be ready to surprise opponents in the post season

tournaments.

The Davidson College swim
team absorbed two more de-
feats, losing to Citadel and
Appalachian by the scores of
54-59 and 51-61 respectively.
Davidson swam fairly well, but
was overpowered by a strong

and deeply manned Appala-
chian squad and then were

out-swum by a scrappy Citadel

gainst Davidson in the Citadel
meet, those being the 400
medley relay and the 200 indivi-

team showed tremendous desire

Coaches tap Florida talent

By DEAN EKLUND
Staff Writer

The entire Davidson football
coaching staff will be traveling
to Florida Monday seeking to
round out this year’s recruiting
effort. Although Davidson re-
cruits through much of the
south. Coach Dave Roberts ex-
plained why Florida receives a
heavy emphasis.

“The population is such that
in the Miami area we can get to
95 schools in a 55 mile radius.
Here in North Carolina there are
170 high schools that play
football. You would have to
take four weeks to cover the
area, but in a period of four
days, five coaches can recruit
from West Palm Beach down
and cover 90 schools. So we can
find a larger number of recruits
in the state of Florida with less
money.”

Roberts also pointed out that
regarding North Carolina tal-
ent, many North Carolina
schools concentrate their re-
cruiting in North Carolina be-
cause they can offer in-state
tuition which makes Davidson
recruiting efforts in the state
more difficult.

Roberts explained that in
Florida the coaches will be
getting in the players’ homes.
The coaches will seek clues to a
player’s character from his fa-
mily background in hopes of
ascertaining whether a particu-
lar player would fit in at
Davidson. ‘

Roberts indicated that the
recruiting priorities as far as
positions this season ranked as
follows: a kicker, a quarterback,
and linebackers.

Roberts elaborated, ‘‘the first
priority was the kicker. We
needed a kicker. We're going to
try to bring in two kickers
because what we’ve had in the
past is we’ve brought in a kicker
and it didn’t pan out so this
year we’re going to try to bring
in two, We’ve got one kicker
committed right now. He has
kicked a 53 yard field goal
which set the Florida record, so

we’re pleased about that.”

In regards to quarterbacks,
Roberts said, ‘‘the second prio-
rity was we wanted a quarter-
back. We had one come on
campus last night. He’s 6’6”,
200 Ibs. out of Miami and is a
very good thrower. We've had
another kid from Alabama on
campus, and a young man
named Brian Whitmire from
Jacksonville, Florida who is
6’4’’, 190 Ibs. All of these three
quarterbacks are very good. We
hope to get two or three to come
to Davidson.”’

“Our third priority was line-
backers. It’s hard for us to tie
up a linebacker who’s a very
good linebacker in high school
and who’s smart enough to get
in here. There are a lot of good
linebackers, but they’re going
to the Pittsburgh’s and the
Florida’s and their GPA’s are
2.0-2.2—nobody with a 3.4+3.5
and a 1100 on the SAT’s. What
we'd like to do is find a fullback
who has good size and can run
but looks like he’d hit you
pretty good. We’re close on a
few. We’re not talking to a
great number of linebackers.
We need to hit four out of six or
we'll end up starting to look a
little bit again.”

Roberts also explained the
yearly recruiting process, ‘‘we
send out about 8000 cards,
which is about “% of the high
schools in the U.S., and we get
a coach’s recommendation back
on a player we ask for—any
player in the top 10 percent of
his class: and with extremely
high SAT’s, 1000-1¥00, we
want them in that category.
Once we get a name back we
send out to the guidance coun-
selor for a transcript, which
immediately eliminates about
85 percent of them. So we get it
down to a working number of
about 500-700 names...Then we
hit the road recruiting.”’

Financially, Roberts ex-
plained, aid to football players
is handled the same as it is for
every student, by the family
filling out a financial aid form.

Roberts noted that there are 40
football players at Davidson
who receive no financial aid. He
also indicated that the only
advantage for a football player
is that the coaching staff can
supplement a player’s financial
aid with Wildcat Club money if
it desires.

Roberts said of recruiting
without the benefit of offering
scholarships, ‘‘I think its very
much an advantage here be-
cause of our academic reputa-
tion. We can talk to the very
best players if they can qualify
academically. We can go into
Florida and find a young man
that Florida’s recruiting or Ten-
nessee’s recruiting and if he can
qualify we’ll go right into the
home. We’re selling the acade-
mics, we’re also selling the
football because we think it’s
super, but why we’re in the
home and why we're allowed to
recruit the kid is because of our
academic reputation, and so

that’s helped us.’

“I think the system is the
right system, I think this
financial aid form very much
puts the emphasis on student
athletes rather than at some of
the larger schools now. Where
you're a football player first and
a student when time allows.
Here with this financial aid
form a football plater is just like
anyone, you're a student first
and an athlete second.”

in defeating Davidson's medley
team.

In the 200 individual medley
Bart Banks of the Citadel
narrowly defeated Jonathan
Washburn of Davidson by com-
ing from behind on the freestyle
leg of the race to out-touch
Washburn at the finish.

Davidson's record dropped to
8-5 with the two defeats, but
the team is not looking back.
Captain Washburn epitomizes
this positive and confident atti-
tude saying, ‘‘things should
turn out differently in the
Conference Championship. I
think that I’ll be able to beat
Banks and our team should beat
Citadel also.”’

This weekend the Cats host
two of their only home meets of
the year. Their shortage of
home meets is due to the lack of
diving facilities in the Johnston
Gym pool. The team must swim
away in order not to forfeit the
16 points for diving. Divers Jim
Kuster and Pete Neefus have

1333 pts. scored

done relatively well this year
with all factors considered.
Each of them must drive into
Charlotte in order to practice
and with limited practice they
have excelled.

The two meets this weekend
will be against the College of
Charleston at 4:00 on Friday
afternoon and Emory at 11:00
Saturday morning. The team’s
next action will be in the three
day Southern Conference
Championships to be hosted by
VMI in Lexington, Va.

“The meets this weekend will
be exciting and competitive,”
said Coach Pat Miller. ‘‘We
should swim really well here at
home after four weekends on the
road. We’re looking forward to
swimming in front of the home
crowd.”

As a special feature during
Friday’s meet against College of
Charleston, the divers will give
a ‘‘special diving exhibition”
which promises to be entertain-
ing.

Record shot down

By TOM NIBLOCK
Staff Writer

The Davidson College Rifle
Team, paced by junior Kather-
ine Whitney, set a new school
record in a narrow loss to the
powerful team from VMI at
home last Saturday.

The heavily favored Keydets,
shooting their best match of the
season, posted a 1333 to edge
out the Wildcats at 1325.
Davidson’s score, however, is
the school’s highest on record.

The match witnessed a group
of shooters scoring 270 or better
in match competition for the
first time in a very long while.
Whitney posted a 273 and
Senior Tom Miller came in at an
even 270. Sophomore John Par-
ham shot a 268, followed by
Junior Tom Niblock at 261.
Reed tilis, a freshman, rounded

out the top five with a 254.
Other Davidson shooters
were Robbie Kirkendol and
Nancy Cornwell at 244 and 239
respectively. Mike Pearson and
Pat Stuart posted 235’s and
Louis Williams shot a 225.
Highlights of the match in- |
cluded Kirkendol’s 100 in the
prone position, and scores of 87
and 86 in the standing position

_by Miller and Whitney.

The loss.to VMI drops the
Cats’ record to 13-6.

Earlier in the week Davidson
upset the Citadel and defeated
U.T. Chatanooga in a Southern
Conference postal meet.

This Saturday Davidson will
host NCA&T and U.T Chatta-
nooga in the last regular season
match. The team will then
compete in two post season
tournaments.
