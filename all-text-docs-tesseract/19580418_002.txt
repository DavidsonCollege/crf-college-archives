BILL REDDING

We have lost’a friend, and Davidson
College has lost one of its most like-
able and promising students. It is im-
possible to comprehend fully the
tragedy of Bill Redding’s death. It is
even more difficult to answer the in-
evitable “Why?”

We are reminded of the words of
Dr. Cunningham on another occasion
of sorrow to the College community.
He spoke of the “equation of eterni-
ty” and of the “reason of God,” and
explained that these cannot be un-
derstood by the human mind. for the
understanding would make us men
no longer.

Our sincerest sympathies go out
to Bill's family. With our sympathy
goes an understanding of their feel-
ing of loss, for Bill will be sorely
missed by his friends at Davidson.

Yet, with a.sense of loss there

comes to us a sense of remembering
and appreciating our having been as-
sociated with him here. We place a
value on the smile, the friendly greet-
ing, and the word of encouragement
which we received in the past, and
we are reminded of the qualities
which made him a gentleman in the
finest sense of the word.

Finally, our sympathy goes to the
other person involved in the tragedy.
This kind of accident has a way of
often taking two lives rather than
one. It is our hope that a spirit of
Christian love can prevent such a dou:
ble cost.

Words have a way of seeming in-
adequate on such occasions as this.
But they are all that we can use to
express a feeling of loss that many
of us will have throughout the years
to come.

Firearm Rule Change Urged

With the exception of the Honor
System, the general attitude among
students concerning most of the Col-
_lege’s rules has been one of laissez
faire: to regard violation of them on
the part of others as really of little
consequence, and (perhaps) even to
break them occasionally oneself.

Coupled with this attitude is an
underlying feeling of resentment to-
-ward the faculty, the source of and
final authority for these rules, for
many of us have fallen into the habit
of regarding most of the faculty regu-
lations concerning student conduct
and dormitory life as unnecessary,
annoying restrictions on trivial mat-
ters, as part of the red tape involved
in any bureaucracy.

This attitude has (within the
memory of the present Davidson gen-
eration) been strengthened -by a ces-
sation of enforcement by the faculty
of some sections of the Student Con-
duct Regulations and the Dormitory
Regulations, and by the fact that the
regulations concerning matters other
than honor offenses and drinking are
little emphasized during Freshman
orientation week and are presented
to the students in such a way that
prohibitions against playing ball be-
tween the dormitories and going bare-
foot on campus receive as much em-

phasis as rules governing the use of
deadly weapons.

This general nonchalance has re-
sulted in widespread violations of the
rule (contained in the ‘Regulations
for Students” handbook and posted in
the Dormitory Regulations notices in
every room) that “students are not
permitted to keep firearms except by
special permission from the Dean of
Students,” this practice has been con-
doned by all of us, nothing whatever
has been done about it, and as a re-
sult.a boy has been killed.

We begin to ask how this came
about and what can be done to in-
sure that nothing of this sort will
happen again. The answer seems
clear: the rule against having fire-
arms on campus must be made a part
of the Student Body Regulations, and
must be backed up by penalties that
are clear, definite, and severe, prefer-
ably suspension from college.

Such a move would bring the fire-
arms rule under the jurisdiction of
the Student Council, and council
members would then be honor-bound
to report offenders and bring them to
trial. Then, perhaps, the student body
—and future college generations —
wjll understand and guard against the
tragic consequences of handling guns.
irresponsibly. —C.H.C.

Seeking, Losing, Keeping, Casting

There is, according to Ecclesiastes,
“a time to seek, and a time to lose,
a time to keep, and a time to cast
away,” and here at Davidson we are
in the middle. of our own seasonal
round of seeking, losing, keeping, and
casting away: Spring Elections.

But when this process is at an
end, we well may finally ask with
the Preacher, “What gain has the
worker from his toil?” For dissatisfac-
tion with the political order one has
just willingly established, although an
inevitable concomitant of a democrat-
ic system, has been more widespread
than usual this year, and perhaps not
without justification.

On a campus regarded by its more
sophisticated inhabitants as being
without “movement” of any kind, a
hardened observer of election
promises might scoff at everything
said in election speeches as cynical
but highly strategic maneuvers in a
perennial game.

However, when a candidate pro-
poses to make (or even to ‘‘consider”
making or to ‘investigate”) basic
changes in the most important fea-
ture of student government, the
Honor System, he deserves careful
attention, faithful support if he is
elected, and strong reproach if noth-
ing is done. And, this year at least,

nothing — or next to nothing—has
been done, either in Honor System
revision or positive action of any
kind, for that matter.

This year the initiative and fore-
sight demonstrated by the LF.C., the
Elections Board, even the Union Book-
shelf Committee, all of them bodies
with no campaign promise commit-
ments and usually the recipients of
little attention or publicity has thrown
a shadow of doubt over the Student
Council and its leadership.

Once again, though, we have elect-
ed a young man as President of the
Student Body who states his inten-
tions of establishing, contingent up-
on student body agreement. an
Honor Council for enforcement of the
Honor System and the student body
regulations, and in addition § to
this a somewhat vaguer but no less
admirable plan for bringing about
greater rapport between the Students
and their Council.

His proposals for putting both
these ideas into effect have been
worked out in detail, appear accepta-
ble in principle, and take knotty prac-
tical matters into account as well. Our
congratulations, then, go to John
Kuykendall on his election, along with
renewed hopes for his Council’s work
next year.—C.H.C.

[Secrets Of Success At ‘Do You Know’ Game
Revealed To Liven Weekend Introductions

By TOM KERNAN

“You look beat. Fetlock,” I
said to my young friend, as we
sat in the Union humoring our
stomachs and watching the
usual philosophers and “Y”
executives guzzle coffee.

“Ive been routed.” he said
dejectedly, He had the look
of a man who had just crawled
out of a philosophy review.
“Hogwell’s date came carly and
I had to go into Charlotte to
meet her plane. All the way

back we played “do you know”,

and I feel like an idiot.”

I nodded sympathetically. “I've
only known one man who had
that part of dance weekends
licked. That was good ole
Charlie Hartug. He seemed to
have a radar-like sense for pick-
ing out “do you knowers" at
the dance; this always let him
get in the first. blow. Charlie
would spot one and the. con-
versation would go sort of like
this—” ..

Charlie: “Oh, so you go to

Swineford. Do you know Sheila
Slime? No? How about Portia-
Pig—you know, the South Caro-
lina “Pigs.” ‘No? That's too

bad; how about Cathy Clutch?”

Girl: (counter attacking vigor-
ously) “Oh. I've heard of her—”

Charlie: (with a suggestive
leer) “Who hasn't?”

Girl: (feeling unconifortable)
“Oh really—hah, hah—Oh yes,
now I know. Yes, she has quite
a reputation.”

Charlies: “Yes, I imagine so,
that wreck left her crippled for
life.”

Girt: (in a real sweat) “Oh—”
followed by nasty silence for
about a minute.

“Usually, though, Charlie
would get his opponent to rattle
on before sinking the harpoon.”

Girl: “Do you know Roderick
Raunch? He lives in Clodsbour-
ough, too.”

“Oh really, no I can’t say that
I do, but then people are al-
ways accusing me of being class
conscious, I imagine I really am
too choosey about friends.”

Girl: (obviously one of the
duller sort) “He has a sister
named Belle—"

Charlie: That's
musical!”

Girl: “Pardon.”

Charlie: “Belle — a lovely

nice; so

- hame.”

Girl: “D’you know Sam
Skoad? Oh you should meet him
if you haven't, he’s the sweetest
thing! He was such a big man
at State—football, baseball—
three years on the “Students
for Moral Earnestness Commit-
tee,” everybody at school was
just crazy about him. But they
say he married a perfectly hor-
rible girl.”

Charlie: (in an icy tone) “My
sister.”

(Girl—exit off stage, resemb-
ling badly wounded moose.)

“If Charlie was in a hurry
he'd cut the contest down a few
innings and go in for a quick
kil”

Girl: Oh, so you know Clara

girl. Have you ever noticed what

LETTERS TO EDITOR:

New Type Ot ‘Cold Virus,’
Dance Weekend Discussed

Spring Frolics
Dear Editor:

In view of recent develop-
ments on this campus it would
seem wise for the student body
to take an objective look at the
dance weekend as it draws
near. This is to be a crucial
weekend in the social life of
Davidson College. Of course,
all dance weekends are impor.
tant to us as individuals, but
the effects of this weekend and
our actions during it may weil
play an important part in mold-
ing faculty opinion which now
seems to be on the border line.

An accident that happened to
be connected with drinking, for
example, could bring about a

faculty reaction that might sce
the reintroduction of the ‘‘on
the breath” rule. If such an ac-
cident happened on the way to,
or at an after dance party, it
would surely mean the end of
such parties.

This is to be the weekend in
which we, the entire Student
Body, will have to prove to the
faculty that we merit the
privilege of unchaperoned par-
ties. Doubtless many of the
Student Body have already
heard rumors concerning dance
weekend regulations. Some of
these rumors may well become
reality, no matter what the con-
duct of the Student Body is this
weekend. But any unfortunate
occurence that befalls a fra-
ternity or even an individual
will be advanced as reason for

LU ae

the punishment of the entire
school’s social activities.

Let us all make this the best
dance weekend ever, and at the
same time let us be aware of
the responsibility that rests on
our shoulders.

—Penn Rainer

New Virus

Dear Editor:

The Davidson College Infir-
mary has ‘just recently come
into contact with a new type of
cold virus which is now present
on the Davidson campus. This
is an extremely contageous vi-
rus which spreads very rapidly.
It. was first noticed ‘by the col-
lege officials about 7:30 p.m. on
Sunday, March 16, 1958, and
again on the following Sunday
at the same time.

The Davidson College Biology

Give Blood
Monday

OR

Tuesday

College Gym

Department in cooperation with
the College Infirmary has been
working diligently to discover
the origin and the symptoms of
this new virus.

After days of determined
study and observation by the
above mentioned organizations
they have come to the follow-
itg conclusion. The virus is
characterized by a shallow, dry
cough and seems to be extreme-
ly sensitive to hymnals of any:
type. The basis for this state-
ment comes from the fact that
the cough produced by this vi-
rus becomes much more intense
and wide spread when the stu-
dent body as a whole is en-
closed in a room with these
disease activating books (for in-
stance chapel or vespers).

There definiely must be
something done about this vi-
rus to keep it from spreading
to other areas of the nation.
I recommend one of the follow-
ing three ideas to the adminis-
tration as a solution to this
problem before it affects those
who have not yet become weak-
ened by this virus. We must
either close school until the vi-
rus is overcome by each and
every individual, omit chapel
and vespers from the Davidson
College curriculum, or the most
logical approach of all, burn all
of the hymnals on the campus
of Davidson College.

ON CAMPUS

ADVICE FROM ANN |

By C. G. H. and C. G. D.
Dear Ann,

I am a Queens girl and I have a problem. I wore a
strapless gown to our Club 58 dance but it kept falling
down all night. I was so embarrassed. What should I do?

30-23-36
Dear 30-23-36,

Don’t worry, if you're from Queens that’s not the on-
ly problem you have. Just remember—when you grow up
to be a big girl you won't have to shoulder the respon-
sibility any longer.

Dear Ann,

I went to the Queens dance last night and boy, was I
ever disappointed! Girls put up such a false front these
days that a poor guy just doesn’t know what he’s up
against.

‘David Gent
Dear David,

You have evidently been dating some girls who just
don’t stack up. But don’t back away from your problem.
Try approaching it from another angle; put on the whole
armour of Ivy League tweed and try Randolph-Macon.

Dear Ann,

I am a Davidson Freshman and I went to my first
Queens dance last weekend. Boy, was I surprised! This
girl took me over to a dark corner and made love to me,
but she swore she had never been kissd before. She was
pretty and those kisses spoke volumes. What should I

0?
Frenzied Frosh
Dear Frenzied,

Beware of dark corners and just remember—a kiss

that speaks volumes is seldom a first edition.

Dear Ann,

I am a Queens girl and my room-mate wrote you
about one of her problems. I-wore a chemise to the same
dance. It was supposed to be the last word in women’s
clothes, but all the boys laughed at me.

Sad Sack
Dear Sad Sack,

It is a well known fact that the last word in women’s

clothes is often a gasp. Just remember—Confuscious say:

“Queens girl in sack
Look like pig in poke.”

COFFEE BREAK

Students Must ' *
Merit Freedom ¥:3

By JOHN BERNHARDT °

What is the position of leadership on the Davidson
campus at present? “T. Paine” in his recent and very well
written letter in the DAVIDSONIAN suggested that the
real problem at Davidson is the “maternal attitude,” and

that it is because the students are not allowed to act as ma-
ture individuals that they develop what is the Davidson
attitude today.

This reasoning is generally held, and theoretically
it make sense. However, practically it does not seem
to fit the facts. Both in participation in student con-
trol and in the intelligence of this participation, we
do not always justify the freedom we have already
been entrusted with.

We have a very tightly knit world here in the:David-
son community. Thus, we can judge ourselves only by
comparison with how we were recently; only a few ex-
ceptional individuals are able to get outside the system
to judge it objectively.

Recently the faculty gave the students a mandate
to improve their attitude and conduct. The objection
to Skit Nite and all the other disturbances was not di-
rected so much at the actions as at the underlying at-
titude. The faculty apparently felt the students could
correct this themselves, and left it with them.

Will the students now show that they merit this con-

fidence? We must soon begin being as objective as we
can about various “traditions” which have grown up with
us.

At present, our true leaders seem to be the loud and
vocal students who mold our opinions into acceptance of
the coughing and the fudging on legalities. If this type
of leadership is maintained, there is no grounds for com-
plaint when the faculty takes control, for this is dia-
metrically opposed to what the faculty and others out-
side our system believe to be good.

We must do two things: participate actively, and par-
ticipate with enlightened objectivity. When we do this,
we shall show that we are mature and merit further free-
dom. Until we do, someone must control our blind little
system, even the faculty.
