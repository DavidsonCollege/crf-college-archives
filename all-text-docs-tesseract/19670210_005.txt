Student Opinion Differs Over PE,,,

(Davidson’s physical educa-
tion program has been the
subject of sometimes harsh
criticism in recent years. In
this first article of a threo-
par) series, the writer presents
ond oxamines the prevailing
student opinions about David-
son PE.)

Physical education, that
much-criticized, little-chang-
ed hallowed tradition of Da-
vidson, promotes moré di-
versified opinions among
the student body than the
cliches from the sports pub-
licity office. For every stu-
dent who wants to change it,
there is another student who
wants to leave this required
venture into the caverns of
Johnston Gym just like it is.

Very few students actually fa-
vor abolishing required PE.
Those who do generally realize
that any campaign of this nature
would te fruitless considering
the. current emphasis on phys-

jeal fitness by various outhori-
ties. n

Many of the opponents of the
present PE activity are mem-
bers of the sophomore class, the
group which has seen the demise
of vespers ond Monday assem-

bly. A general gripe is the cut:

system which allows only five
free cuts and four additional
cuts which must be made up
before the end of the semester
for a student to pass the course.

Another gripe is the written
tests given at the end of each
quarter. One outspoken sopho-
more noted, ‘'The tests don't
serve any purpose and each
coach differs in the amount he
censiders the results.’ Another
sophomore told of being put in
softball after his soccer class
enrollment became too large.
After playing softball for the
entire spring quarter, he was
given a soccer test which he
initially failed.

Another student. noted that the
tests do not always cover the
material undertaken in class,

But some coaches give the an-
swers to atudents before the
test. :

Another grievance is the faul.
ty showers in the main Jocker
room plus a constant absence
of soap in the wall dispensers.

‘Perhaps a good sign is the ap-
proval given to their first se
meéster fn physienl education by
many freshmen. Most freshmen
lauded their quarter in soccer,
especially under Harry Fogle-
man. Many experienced their
first taste of tumbling and gym-
nastics and wrestling as well as
soccer this fall. Their enthusi-
asm indicates that they want a
basic PE program which intro-
duces them to sports their high
schools lacked.

The major criticism of most
freshmen is the attitude of some
of the coaches. One. noted. ‘In
the morning, their own sports
shouldn't interfere, but they do.”
Another said, “Some coaches
are great in their sport, but act-
ed uninterested in the others."

What kind of coach do PE stu:

dents want? Notable praise went
to Bob Brown who plays hand-
ball with one of his smaller
clasges and to Dick Short, who
Vreally shows an interest’ in
the progress of his small weight
lifting closs,

But in other sports, students
want to go their own way. In
basketball, a sophomore said,
“They ought to help the guys
who need help and let the rest
of us play.”

Another gripe of most sopho-
mores is the fact that other than
electing to take a quarter of ac
tivity at the Lake Campus, they
are entirely at the whims of the
Director of Physical Education
as to thelr activity. PE 21-22 ad-
verlises election of activities in
the college catalogue.

The two philosophies of stu-
dents are generally 1) the guys
who believe “if you are going
to sweat. why not get something
out of it,” and 2) the guys who
use PE ''to wake me up after
physics.’ Many of the first

Poole To Lead ’Cats Again

TEAM LEADER

Moser Adds Talent, Control

By DON SEWELL
Sports Writer

Dave Moser has been a
man the Wildcats have re-
lied on all season. Playing
the point position on of-
fense, Moser has been called
upon game after game to
use his fancy dribbling to
bring the ball up the floor.
Once in the front court,
Moser has set up many scor-
ing opportunities with his
passing.

The sophomore tri - captain
from Fort Wayne, Ind. has
shown great improvement this
season and now stands as an es-
tablished team leader. Only 6-1,
Moser hardly looks the part of a
rebounder, but he is the third
highest rebounder on the team,
close behind second-place Tom
Youngdale.

a

Moser also does his share of
scoring: Doing nearly al} his
shooting from the outside, he
averages nine points a game,
connecting on more than 40 per
cent of his shots from the field
and nearly 85 per cent of his
free throw attempts. Moser has
impressed both fans and oppon-
ents many times with his hard-
driving jump shot. Shooting
quickly, he often appears to be
off balance when he puts the
ball up, but his soft touch has
sent many through the hoop.

The hard-pressing style of de-
fense that troubled the Wildcats
early in the season put pressure
on Moser to spearhead the back-
court ntlack. Whether driving
hard acrogs the time line or
evading his defender with a
smooth behind the back dribble,
Moser can be counted on to

bring the ball up court.

Several of the presses the
‘Cats have met this season have
been zone presses, with a double-
team on the man with the ball.
Moser explains that he and his
teammates have been able to
beat this type of press -because
they have developed the neces-
sary teamwork. Still. it is Moser
who carries most of the back-
court load.

“We have confidence in Dave's
bringing the ball up court." said
teammate Wayne Huckel. “He
allows us to think more about
setting up the offense once he
wets Lhe ball to us.”

“T don’t use that behind-the
back dribble to show off or any-
thing.” added Moser. ‘It is just
something that TI have done since
high school when I have needed
to."

MOSER CRANKS UP 'CAT ATTACK
Cool Soph Shows Off Ball-Handling Talents

Couch Lefty Driesell praised
the tredheaded guard for his
brand of play. ‘‘Dave has im-
proved a great deal in handling
the ball against a press. He has
seen a jot of them now, and all
he ever needed was experience
to be able to beat his defend-
ers,”

Driesell added that Moser’s'
performances in the St. Joseph
and Richmond games have heen
particularly outstanding, He said
that the reason for this wns that
Moser has been driving for the
baskel more often, sharpening
the offensive threat.

the St. Joe game illustrates Mos

Moser has been 9 guest on the

several times this year, often
being called on to describe plays
or analyze Davidson's play. “1
teally enjoy being on Coach
Drieseil's show. I think it is good
experlence because it forces me
to think, then act immediately."

It ts this immediate action that
Moser excels jn. His lightning
fast passes and quick shots show
that he can react immediately
to a sudden opportunity. I have
always felt that the whole idea
of competition was to see wihio
could think and act the fastest,”
he said. ‘‘T lave to compete.”

Moser has been pleased by the
team's performances during Lhe
last two games, He olso said he
feels confident about the rest of
the schedule. “If we can gain
some momentum by winning our
last games, it will send us Into
