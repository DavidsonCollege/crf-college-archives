The affirmative was upheld by Johnsén
Potts and Orgain, and the negative .by
Humphrey, Jenkins, Burns and Brown
Vhe affirmative held that Hughes ought

Ou Satur-
the regular

to be elected because he has shown great
wisednr and ability as Supreme Court
iwdge > that he helped enact a great deal
of wise measures while governor off,
New York, and chat Wilson ought aor
to be elected hecause he has shown
weakness in dealing with England ove
the censorship of our mails, and that he
has failed in his Mexican policy. “Phe
negative on the other hand held chat
Wilson should be our next president
because his foreign policy in regard to
Germany has been a clear-cut success,

as shown by Germany's compliance with]!

our requests; that he has kept up out of
war; that his foreign policy as a whole
has been better than could have been
expected under the circumstances: that
his domestic policy has been a notable
success, as is shown by the enactment
of the Rural Credits Act, the Federal
Reserve Act and the Child Labor Laws,
and that Hughes ought not to be elected
because his efficiency as a Supreme
Court judge does aot at all indicate that
he will prove himself capable as an ad-
ministrator. Both the committee and
the house decided in favor of the nega
tive,

On Monday morning orations were
delivered by Bennett, 5. R. Keesler
and T. M. Mitchell. Bennett spoke 01
“Our Great Postal System: Keesler
on “The Summer Camp as an ideal
way for a college student to spend his
vacation,” and Mitchell's subject was
“The Origin of Davidson College.”

In the Philanthropic Society the
ouestion, “Resolved, “That Hughes
should be elected at the next) Presiden-
tial election,” was upheld on the affirm-
ative by Ratchford, Alexander, Spence

and Fowle. and on the negative by
Clark, Dunlap. Kornegay, Boney and
Webber. ‘The decision, both of — the

house and the judges, was in favor of
the negative.

The points broveht out by the affirm.
ative were, that Wilson's decision in the
Mexican situation, his inactivity in the
European war and the passage of the
Adamson Labor bill were detrimental
to the United States. ‘Their endorse-
ment for Hughes was for his — fight
against the gas and insurance monopol-
ies and his past record with his prog-
rams for woman suffrage and high
tariff,

The negative based their arguments
on the legal statutes endorsed by Wil-

son, such as that on the Federal Reserve
Bank sistem, the Eight-hour Law and
the Child Labor Bill.
