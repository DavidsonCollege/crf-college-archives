Yemen program approved

Students looking for an un-
usual and exciting study abroad
option may find it in the Davidson
in Yemen program, which was
approved by vote of the faculty last
week and will begin its inaugural
journey next July. Tobe offered in
the summers of odd-numbered
‘years, the six-week program will
offer 100 classroom hours of in-
tensive study in Arabic, as well as
a Middle Eastern political science
or history course, for which par-
ticipants will earn two course cred-
its.

On the southern tip of the Ara-
bian peninsula, Yemen is a coun-
try the New York Times has called
“the land of the Queen of Sheba
and the ancient Incense Route.” Its
capital, Sanaa, is where the pro-
gram will be based.

History professor Johnathan
Berkey, who conceived the pro-
gram with political science profes-

sor Ken Menkhaus, says he is “‘de-
lighted” about faculty approval of
the program. After noting genuine
student interest in the study of the
Middle East upon his arrival to
Davidson in 1993, Berkey says he
“started looking about for a
Davidson program somewhere in
the Arabic-speaking world.”

A year ago, Berkey met Sabri
Saleem, director of the Yemen
Language Center, touted in its bro-
chures as “the only language cen-
ter in Yemen devoted exclusively
to teaching Arabic as a foreign

language.” ‘ina lth
“[Saleem] was “quite orga-

nized, efficient, and impressive,”

Berkey says. “He managed to put
together a package that would in-
volve instruction in Arabic, lec-
tures, discussions, and field trips...
for a very reasonable figure, and

his institute came highly recom-

mended.”

Menkhaus, who will be lead-
ing the first trip, says Davidson in
Yemen will offer distinct advan-

tages over study in other countries:
“Not many people get to see this
part of the world,” he says. Sanaa
differs from tourist-filled Cairo,
Menkhaus says, in that “[students]
are going to be special— they’ll
have direct access to the Yemeni
people.”

Berkey says “the heart of the
program is the language,” and stu-
dents will have the option of con-
tinuing Arabic study on return to
Davidson in the fall. But
Menkhaus, who says he is “‘com-
fortable talking about regional dy-
namics,’;, will also.be Po-
litical Science 242, “Politics of the
Red Sea.” :

The course will be supple-
mented by guest lecturers, site vis-
its, and travel.

Applications will be avail-
able in the Office for Study Abroad
in December.

Cost for the program is esti-
mated at $3500, which includes
airfare, room and board, travel
within Yemen, and tuition.

Neigert leaves school

By Mary Care JALONICK

Executive Editor

Sophomore Robert Neigert
moved out of his room this week-
end, and it is not known for certain
when he will be back to Davidson.

On November 1, Neigert, in-
toxicated, left a life-threatening.
message on sophomore Robbie
Lee’s voice mail and later cut se-
nior Chris Machon with an illegal
butterfly knife. Lee has pressed
charges against Neigert for “com-
municating a threat”; Machon has
not pressed charges.

Referring to Neigert’s depar-
ture, Machon says, “what needed
to happen happened.”

Machon is still taking drugs
for the pain in his hand, and is
unable to do schoolwork. He says
his professors are “giving me a lot
of leeway, and are very under-
standing.”

Lee says that she now feels “a
lot safer.” She isn’t sure if she can
forgive Neigert for his harsh words,
but does acknowledge that he sent
heralong letter of apology. Among
other regrets and explanations,
Neigert said the night was a “night-
mare” for him, and that he was
“fully responsible” for his actions.

Ina police report released this
week, witnesses confirmed that
Neigert was violent throughout the
night of the Ist, repeatedly threat-
ening Lee. The problems started
after a problem arose between the

two at Phi Gamma Delta, in which
she shoved him and he’ became
angry. He was escorted out of the

fraternity and taken tocampus bya
person who said he made threaten-
ing remarks about Lee (who re-
mained at the fraternity) in the car.

According to the report,
Neigert remained violent when he
returned to his room. He then left
the threatening message to Lee.
Machon later found Neigert in the
Belk stairwell with a knife, talking
about Lee, and tried to calm him
down. Aftera few minutes, Machon

“unconsciously moved forward,”
and Neigert cut the top of his wrist
down to the bone.

Neigert immediately dropped
the knives and ran with Machon to
the Student Health Center, where
he was arrested for leaving the
message.

Lt. D.E. Mc Laurin, Head of
Investigations at the Campus Po-
lice, says that he would “have to
say” that the incident was “not
intentional ... with the pressure
students are under here ... they [go
out and drink], and alcohol changes
their personality ... [they] get car-
ried away sometimes, and do things
they might regret.”

He has talked to Neigert, and
he says that Neigert “doesn’t seem
like the kind of person'who would
[do this kind of thing].”

Still, he says, he has never
seen such an incident at Davidson.

After ten years here, “I’ve seen
a few fights, but nothing like this.”

Dean Leslie Marsicano, who
cannot speak about the case spe-
cifically, agrees. She says, “there
is not a Clear pi t-
involves all of these elements.”

Students interested in, and have potential, in careers
in mathematics, the natural sciences and engineering
(but not medicine) are invited to apply for the Barry
M. Goldwater scholarship program. It is open to
students who will be seniors or juniors during the
1997-98 year. It awards up $7000 per year. In
practice, only students with a good GPA and
research experience are eligible.
