LOCAL POST OFFICE

Real Campus Center
Is Slightly Off-Campus

Through rain, sleet, hail, snow and railroad cars the U. S.
Mail arrives at the Davidson Post Office; through rain, sleet,
hail, snow and regular cars the Davidson students meet it

there. ay

The little brick building beside
the empty parking lot on Depot
Street is frequented by far more
students than is any other single
off-campus landmark. Its age and

terize one of the greatest motivat-
ing factors of most Davidson stu-
dents it would probably be, “Let’s
go to the P. 0.!"

A slight disturbance was caused
on the night of November 2 at a
concert in Chambers when an
elderly lady became ill and had
to be taken from the auditorium.
Students who made inquiries were
told that she was a Miss Thompson
who lived in the town. The next
morning, .in the small-print obitu-
aries of the Charlotte Observer,
there was a notice of the death
of “Miss Thompson.”

Many are the boys who cross the
time-smoothed threshhold of the
Post Office in anticipation of a
letter from the same person from
whom their fathers had crossed
these threshholds years ago to
hear.

The volume of mail channeled
through the Davidson Post Office
is necessarily seasonal. Marked
runs are noticed on and _ around
Valentine’s Day, St. Bartholomew's
Day, Columbus's Day and the night
before dance week-ends.

Until the turn of the century
the P. O. was officially the Post
Office of Davidson College; it is
now named by the City of Davidson
rather than the College. The Post
Office serves 5,500 persons in the
community, renting 440 boxes to
the personnel of Davidson College
and receiving 60 per cent of its
gross income from them.

While the postmaster concerns
himself with the volume of the in-
coming mail, the students brush
past one another in the small lob-
by concerning themselves with the
content and source of each letter.

The sources may be Salem, Pied-
mont Bank. or the home-town Ar-
my Recruiting Office. The contents
would probably include checks,
statements for June’s Book of the
Month, and an “I'd love to come.
but .. .” reply or two.

Every morning after chapel for
over fifty years Davidson students
have moved en masse to the Post
Office for the morning mail. Then
again before supper and after
breakfast Postmaster Stough sees
more than just a few eyes peering
at him through the dusty box-
windows.

Filming Resumed
On ‘Davidson Story’

Filming of the ‘Davidson Story’
will be resumed in the very near
future according to Mr. Robert
Sailstad who has just returned
from a trip to the Protestant Radio
and Television Center in Atlanta,
Georgia.

Although the Center has not yet
announced a replacement for Mr.
Gunn who resigned as director
recently, one will be appointed
soon.

HELICOPTER

The next step in the filming pro-
cess will consist of general. shots
of the campus and buildings from
a helicopter. Mr. Sailstad said that
the obstructions to long range
shots caused by the numerous trees
on the campus will, thus, be over-
come.

Under the new schedule which
is now being set up, movie-making
will proceed at a somewhat slower
pace than previously planned. Va-
rious scenes will be filmed through-
out the school year.

‘The Davidson Story’ will be re-
leased sometime next year Mr.
Sailstad said.

Bridge Tournament
To Be Held Tuesday

There will be a Master Point
bridge tournament in the ball-
room of the College Union at 7:30
p.m. Tuesday, November 13. All
students, faculty members, and
townspeople are invited to partici-
pate. The cost will be 50c per per-
son.

Miss Hattie was not known to
the college men of the 1950's. She
was just another of the elderly

village. But the town and the col-

Palm Beach, Florida will deliver
the sermon this Sunday for Ves:

A native of Scotland, Dr. Lind-

wick, five miles from the birth
place of Robert Burns. There he
spoke the same dialict which
characterizes Burns poetry.

ties on Burns and his poetry. Au-
diences in both the United States
and Europe have heard his lectures
on the subject of Burns. His is one
of the finest libraries of the works
of Burns in existance,

From 1915 to 1922 Lindsay
served as pastor of the Hanson
Place Church of Brooklyn. From
there he went to serve the Brook-
line Baptist Church of Boston,
Massachusetts until 1952 when he
went to Palm Beach.

While in Boston he was selected
by the Boston Herald as one of the
ten great preachers of the United
States.

Monday night at 8:30 in the Col-
lege Union, Dr. Lindsay will .lec-
ture on the poetry of Robert Burns.
At this time he will dress the
part in authentic Scottish kilts.
Refreshments will be served at
