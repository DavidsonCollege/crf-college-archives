_ In Plaza Suite, currently.
being performed by the David-
son community Players, Neil
Simon present us with three
one-act plays all revolying a-
round the same suite in the
Plaza Hotel in New York. He
people his play with typical
stereotypes and leaves it up to
the actors to give life personali-
ty to the characters.

The Community Players at- .
tack this task with enthusiasm
and relish and ‘successfully —a-
void pasteboard representations
ultimately achieving a fairly
sophisticated, witty comedy.

Don Lovell’s direction: comes
across as crisply efficient which
keeps the play moving at a good
pace with only occassional lags.
He has put his actors at ease
and given them the fluidity to
develop. The comfortable set
also gives a sense of naturalness
so.that in no way do the actors
seem out of place.

Scotty Nichols gives an al-
most desparate sarcasm to her
character, Karen Nash, which is
entirely appropriate to a woman
whose marraige is fally apart.
She handles sublte mood shifts
nicely as Karen becomes in-
creasingly aware of the fruit-
-lessness of her existence.

Bo Brickles, as Sam Nash,
overcomes an initial stiffness
and settles wonderfully into his
workaholic role.. He and Nichols
both-present. a truely poignant.
portray! in the final minutes of
the scene as both characters
strive for false security to mask
their overpowering insecurity.

As Jesse Kiplinger, Donald
Kimmel undoubtedly looks the
part of the Hollywood producer.
He adequately achieves the
wolfish attitude and demeanor

Darby acts as assistant |<"

Interviewed by

FEATURES EDITOR

Jake Darby is a senior music
oummgajor who served ts" assistant
director for Plaza Suite, She
tried out for last year’s college
production of As You Like It to
combat severe stage fright be-
fore her senior piano recital.
Darby got the lead. Here she
talks about both types of Da-
vidson theatre from on and
Lf behind sta ge.
Devideonian—How did you get
fo be assistant director of Plaza
¥ Suite?
~ Darby: They just called me up.

Thet’s the neat thing about
egnomunity theatre; you just
call gomebody up and ask them
to help. It doesn’t work that
way. with Drama 21. You can
ask your roommete to come
paint sets for six hours but

they'll probably say they have ®
or something.

Speideonlan—What exactly
does an assistant director do?
Dorby: Everything. It’s a mec-
es job thet involves so

expected of him but somehow

leaves the audience wanting a

little something more out of his
character.

Meg Kello is simply marve-
lous as Muriel Tate, the star-
struck suburban housewife. Her
timing on certain lines ap-
proaches brilliance-and her co-
mic wit. becomes steadily more
apparent as Muriel slips into
drunkeness- =

But top acting honors must
go to Max Polley and Susan
Abbott as Roy and Norma
Hubley. They compliment each
other perfectly as the parents of
the bride caught in an untenv- -
able situation. Polley manages
to evoke pity for the crassly

Canty, Vusav ducsn t get done.
Davidsonian—So you did a lot
of the dirty work?

Darsy: 1 just helped hold
everybody and everything ,to-
gether. You néed to realize
you're dealing with satiething
very subjective. The assistant
director shouldn't direct.
Davidsonian—Did you try to
direct?

Darby: I tried to keep my
mouth shut. Everyone has their
opinions. I personally think
that if a director wants you to
stand on your head you should.
A play is good only if everyone
obeys the director, even if you
don’t agree with him.

materialistic hubby as he bel-
lows through the acts.

Ultimately the production
comes off with plenty of style
and polish. The three acts do
seem to lack surface unity other
than the same setting, but the
Community Players give the
play actual unity ugh Lo-
vell’s direction and tly

good performances by the ac-

tors themselves.

Plaza Suite will be presented
again tonight and Saturday at

‘Hodson Hal! in Cunningham

Fine Arts Building. Tickets are
available for $2.50 and may be
purchased at the door. Curtain ‘
time for both performances is
8:15 p.m.

cism taken seriously?

Darby: 1 actually think the

community - players listened to
me more. The average Davidson

student actor has had lots of.

experience and probably knows
more than me. I’ve only acted
once. I’ve worked behind stage
for lots of productions.
Davidsoniap—iow is it different
to work backstage, as opposed
to acting?

Darby: Backstage work is
neater. You know it’s good if
_ people don’t notice it. Back-
stage workers can’t be nervous

because the actors are. Bach-|

stage people always feel that

ferent to work with a com-
munity theatre group, rather
than a college one?

Darby: The smal} cast certainly
made a big difference. Plaze
Suite involves six actors and a
small dedicated back-up crew
that walks in off the street.
Drama 21 has about seventy
students who all participate in
productions. With an intimate
group it was easier to criticize
