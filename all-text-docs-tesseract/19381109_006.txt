trouble on North Carolina soil this year. They have played twice, |
once in Charlotte against Clemson and once in Raleigh against Wake
Forest. Both games have resulted in ties.

It will be a big day Saturday. Homecoming with all the old
grads pouring in from all parts of the country to watch the game.
As usual Davidson is rated as the Under-dogs, but ask members
of the varsitjr squad—they seem to think that there is a surprise
in store. The squad is in good shape, and in good spirit, and will
be in there with only one motive in mind—to win. Records: show

and Swede Johnson saw plenty of service last
year and can be classed as veterans. Iverson, Hicks, Tice, Cowan,
and Boyd earned their letters and should be the backbone of a
neat quintet. Norman Shepard, Ahletic Director, will again. coach
the squad. Davidson’s quint had plenty of tough luck last year
losing several games by one and two point margins. The year pre-
ceding last, the ‘Cats were kept out of the Southern Conference
tourney by a toss of a coin and last year by only 12 points. How-
ever, with the experienced men on hand, Davidson should rate

high in basketball circles before the-end of the season.

ROSE BOWL QUESTION: It looks like there are just about
three or four teams left that have chances for the coveted Rose Bowl
nomination from the east. Carnegie Tech's fine victory over Pitt’s

mighty Panthers lowered Jock Sutherland’s team chances considerably,

but they have a possible chance to receive the bid. Texas Christian;

with only apparent pushovers left on their schedule, are unbeaten and
untied and should rate high in the matter. Tennessee, if they can
push by Vanderbilt’ and Kentucky, will certainly be in the running,
but’ Duke, who has yet to be beaten, tied, or even scored upon,
seems the logical selection. Duke faces Syracuse, who are as hard
to keep up with as race horses.. North Carolina State, and Pitt, in
their Jast three games. Surely if they can hurdle over these elevens
for wins they should rate the bid. But Pitt, even if they did get
licked by Carnegie, looms as a barrier that will keep them out of the
running. Anyway, as Duke is our nearest neighbors, they ought to be
the student body's team for the Rose’ Bowl. (Maybe those Tennessee

lads disagree, but they can’t be blamed).

Duke has virtually clinched the Big Five top honors and also
the Southern Conference Championship as they have only one
game left—North Carolina State. North Carolina State can’t be
rated as a pushover even if Virginia Tech did give them a neat
7-0 licking. Look how they held Manhattan last week to a
measly 3-0 victory after they had beat out the New Yorkers
in nearly every department. They'll be heérd from in the Duke
game—louder than many expect.

Davidson's cross-country team certainly had some bad breaks last
week-end. First of all, regular runners, Bill Telford and Dick
Gammon, were out because of injuries. Then to top things off, the team
enroute to Guilford, had an accident that shook several, members of
the team up considerably.

two

They did as well as could be expected under
such conditions and gave the Quakers a good run for their money.
Probably more “misses” were recorded by sports writers’ in
selecting their weekly guesses last week than there has been in
a long time, because of so many major upsets throughout the country.
Carnegie’s win over Pitt was rated as the major upset of the
country. However, the loss proved one thing—that Pitt’ without
“Biggie” Goldberg doesn’t make half as much noise as they do
with him. Wisconsin’s win over Northwestern, who only the week
before had bowled over Minnesota 6-3, fooled many of the scribes.
Southern California’s win over California threw a monkey wrench
in the western Rose Bowl question. Many fans thought that Tulane
led by Bronco Brunner, would breeze through Alabama but they
were fooled. Fordham beat a strong St. Mary’s eleven after one
of the most exciting games played Saturday. South Carolina beat

Duquesne 7-0 and Villanova romped over Auburn 25-12 in two other

surprise wins.

With all these upsets gding on, it was certainly lucky that no pre-
dictions were made in this column last week and because of the pos-
sibilities of mort similiar upsets coming this week, no predictions, ex-
cept one—Davidson over V. M. I., will be made.

Capable and Steady

Ned Iverson, whose six-foot four-inch frame stamps him as a real
offensive threat, and George Richmond, sturdy little guard, have been
playing good football for the ’Cats to date. Iverson has figured well
on the offense with some brilliant pass-snagging to his credit. Rich-
mond, although light and small, is a sliding, slashing guard that has
