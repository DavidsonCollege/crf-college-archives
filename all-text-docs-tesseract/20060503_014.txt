Bobcats battle problems, stay in Charlotte

By WILSON McCrory
Sports Editor Emeritus

When the NBA returned to Charlotte in
2004 after a two-season hiatus when the for-
mer Charlotte Hornets skipped town for New
Orleans, I was convinced the new team and
its $265 million home were going to fail.

While I was personally excited to see the
NBA come back to a place it had once been

so successful, I didn’t think the Charlotte ©

fans would again support a team after being

so burned by a Hornets franchise the city’

once embraced by selling out 364 straight
games over six seasons.

In particular, I feared the backlash from
the new arena that was built despite the
Charlotte voters’ rejection in a 2001 city-
wide referendum would create a climate the
new Bobcats franchise could not overcome
- after the final difficult years with the
Hornets.

The Bobcats have certainly had some mis-
steps in their first two years as well, such as
when owner Bob Johnson tried to launch a
subscription cable TV network around the
Bobcats, or when he raised ticket prices sub-
stantially in the team’s second year as a
result of their move to the new downtown
arena.

Instead of generating the goodwill the
Bobcats so badly needed, those moves con-
tinued to push the fans away from the fledg-
ling team.

Despite opening a gleaming stadium in the
heart of downtown Charlotte this season, the
Bobcats were just 23rd in league-wide atten-
dance with 16,366 fans per game despite the
new facility. ;

Amazingly, though, the Bobcats have

somehow given themselves a chance in this ©

city because of their play on the hardwood.

Sure, they won just 19 games in their first
year, and the jump to 26 wins in 2006 was
hardly much to brag about.

The Bobcats still finished with the third-
worst record in the. league and hardly lived
up to rookie Raymond Felton’s preseason
prediction that the team would reach the
playoffs in only its second year.

But the Bobcats showed this April, when
most of the teams outside of the Playoffs had
given up and packed it in for the off-season,
that this group has a chance to be truly spe-
cial.

Charlotte went 6-3 over the final two
weeks of the regular season, including a 92-
91 overtime win over an Indiana team fight-
ing for its playoff life, and played each game
like it still mattered.

The effort was epitomized by Gerald
Wallace, the Bobcats’ leading scorer, who
refused to sit on the bench for the finale
despite Coach Bernie Bickerstaff’s insis-
tence that he call the season quits.

Instead, Wallace limped his way around
the court but somehow found a way to help
his team win one more in Charlotte’s seventh
sell-out of the year.

For all of the complaints fans today have
about the NBA — you can fill in the blank
here, as I will readily admit the NBA doesn’t
hold a candle to college basketball — the
Bobcats have demonstrated an amazing team
concept from start to finish that belies the
eternal NBA-bashing and have formed a
foundation that has a chance to be special.

From Wallace to Felton to Emeka Okafor,
the Bobcats have done a great job.crafting a
young roster that is hungry and committed to

Higher score.

team offense and even a bit of defense.

- Wallace is the first non-center ever to
average two steals and two blocks through-
out a season, and he played power forward
for most of the year despite a 6’7” frame that
is far better suited to the wing spot.

. Felton averaged 16.8 points and 7.3 assists
after the All-Star game, and he plays an
exciting brand of up-tempo basketball that
allows him to create his own shot or get his
team running.

Okafor was the Rookie of the Year over
Dwight Howard and Ben Gordon in 2005
because of his work on the blocks and the
boards, and he’ll return to anchor the
Bobcats’ front-line next year after sitting out
most of this season with persistent ankle
problems.

Throw in the workman-like efforts of
unheralded role players Matt Carroll, Sean
May, Brevin Knight and Melvin Ely, among
others, and the Bobcats are a blue-collar
bunch that is far better than their 26 wins
suggest.

Sure, the Bobcats are still short on a two-
guard that can allow Felton to play his natu-
ral point-guard position full-time, and a more
physical center to counter the finesse of
Primoz Brezec certainly couldn’t hurt.

In due time, the Bobcats are going to have
to transition from tough competitors to win-
ners, or the fans will leave the new uptown
arena as deserted as the former Charlotte
Coliseum was for the Hornets.

But for all of the mistakes Charlotte and
the Bobcats have made to make this new
relationship a failure, the franchise has done
the most important thing right: crafting a
team this city can allow itself toidentify with
once more.
