On Y Easter Gift Fund

Davidson students will decide
Monday how the YMCA gift fund
will be spent this year.

Chaplain Will Terry told THE
DAVIDSONIAN that offering will
be collected in vespers for the
next two weeks to supply the
money for the fund. One other
such offering will be collected
later in the semester.

There will be no dorm solici-
tation as in the past.

The amount of money to be
collected for the fund has not
yet been determined.

In Monday's chapel the pro-
posals will be made for different

ways of spending the money.

Walt McDonald. a 1964 grad-
uate, will present the case for
establishing a scholarship fund
for underprivileged girls in Char-
lotte.

was proposed by Ken Ander-

The ‘“‘New Friends for David-
son” drive has gotten off to a
very successful start. Over $7,000
has already been raised by
Davidson College students over
the spring break.

Three students — Bill Kend-
rick, Duff Armfield and Clyde
Timmons — raised over $1,000
apiece. The three contributions
came from three different
sources — one from a corpora-
tion, one from a foundation and
one from a private individual.

Another student who was
merely chatting with a business-
man in his home town about
Davidson happened to mention
the program to him and immedi-
ately received a check for sever-
al hundred dollars.

The drive was originated by

is unsure of how to approach a
person with this idea. Jelks said,
he should talk to any of the stu-
dents who have already raised
money or any member of the
Steering committee.

Kendrick, who collected his
money from a corporation, said:
“The experience of soliciting
money for Davidson from a cor-
poration that is in no way con-
nected with Davidson College
is both unique and interesting.
The student is given the chance
to sell both himself and his col-
lege, and, in my case ‘at least,
can be overwhelmed at the re-
sponse.”

tential donors at first.”’ com-
mented Timmons, ‘‘but I found
that this was a real opportunity
to meet and talk with people and
to make contacts with successful
businessmen.”

Armfield had this to say about
hfs experience: ‘Regardless of
whether one might wish to con-
tribute to Davidson, I was very
much impressed by the general
interest shown toward Davidson.
It became a matter of pride to
solicit for Davidson.”

Alumni Director Bil! Bondu-

with this remark: “It certainly
was a wonderful feeling to see
those three boys come in on
Monday morning with checks
for over $1,000."

Dr. Paul M. Sweezy, editor of
Monthly Review and former pro-
fessor of economics at Harvard,
Cornell, and Stanford, will speak
in chapel next Tuesday, April 12.

A native of New York, Dr.
Sweezy received his AB and PhD

so studied at the London School
of Economics.

Back Seat Love, Airplane Falls
Are Sources For James Dickey

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Editor

What does the modern
young poet find to write
about? If visiting lecturer
James Dickey is any indi-
cation, he writes about any-
thing that enters his mind,
from falling from an air-

lane to making love in the
back seat of an old junked
Pierce Arrow.

Invited to visit the Davidson
campus by the English depart-
ment, Dickey gave a reading of
several of his poems in Hodson
Hall last night. Standing around
6 feet 2 inches and weighing
about 210 pounds, Dickey cas-
ually kept the audience’s atten-
tlon with anecdotes about the
origins of his ideas, usually from
his childhood in North Georgia.

Dickey's poetry is marked by
powerful images, made even
more so by the poet’s rapid,
strong delivery. The picture of
stacked autos, inhabited by
roaches, black snakes and toads
is pounded at the listener, as
teenage lovers strive to meet
each other in the privacy of an
old Pierce Arrow, in “Cherry
Log Road.”

Another piece, “The Aura”
deals with the teenage fad, the
transistor radio. A father's son
is killed when in his early teens,
and the father is left with the
only reminder of his son, the
eternal music from the radio.

In such a subtle way. Dickey
lodges his protest againts a so-
ciety which would allow such a
terrible situation to exist.

In a critical work, Suspect? in
Poetry, Dickey makes the state-
ment. that poetry exists to be
experienced, and, likewise,
should come from the poet's
own personal expereince. This is
exactly the case in his own
poems: he waits until he is sure
of a theme and then writes
about it.

the violence of it.”

Dickey got the idea of the
poem from a news release in
the New York Times, describ-
ing the death of a stewardess
who was sucked out of the plane
at high attitude, falling into a
corn field. The most peculiar
thing about it was that she had
no clothes on when she was
found, and authorities said she
must have taken them off dur-
ing the fall.

What follows is his description
of what she must have felt while
plummeting to carth. What
seems to be a whole realization
of life passes before: her eyes,
exhilarating her to proportions
unknown to her before.

It is this feelimg that must
have moved her remove her
clothes so that she could in
every sense be iree. Dickey
seems to say that you haven’t
lived until you fall to your death.

since then.

Dr. Sweezy won the David A.
Wells prize in 1938 and was re-
cipient of the demobilization
award of the Social Science Re-
search Council in 1946.

Dr. Sweezy is a noted author.
His most recognized work is The

he has written three other books

collar construction is gently RIGHT. Do you want to hang
your shirt up? A trim hanger loop sees to that. Room to
