’Cat Cagers in Scoring

Davidson Quintet Wins Nine of the
Seventeen Games Played This
Season

TEAM SCORES 452 POINTS

Rusk and Goodman Also High
Scorers for Team

Two men on the Wildcat basketball team
this year ran a very close race for scoring
the most number of points during the en-
tire season. The high point man for the sea-
son was Grier Martin, who scored a total
of 110 points. Martin started out the season
at forward and also alternated at center
with Pierce, but when the latter dropped out,
Martin was shifted to the’ center position
for’ the remainder of the season, holding
down this post in great style. Mathis fol-
lowed close on the heels of Martin and was
second in the scoring with 108 points. In
more than one game Mathis was high point
man and his shooting was one of the high
spots of the past season. Rusk swapped from
center to forward this year, was next in the
scoring with 92 points. Next came Captain
“Sleepy” Goodson, who was out most of
the latter part of the season but still man-
aged to stay in fourth with 70 points. Other
scorers were: Proctor, 32 points; Pierce, 17
points; Peabody, 14 points; Boucher, 5
points, and Bernard, 4 points.

During the past season the team played
a total of seventeen games and amassed a
total of 452 points for an average of a frac-
tion over 26 points a game. Of the seven-
teen games played the ’Cats won nine and
lost eight; in the Big Five Davidson won
three games, two from Carolina and one
from State, losing two games to Duke and
one each to State and Wake Forest.

The summary of field goals and fouls of

Evans Leads Freshmen

Captain Bob Evans, star forward, led the
Freshman basketball team in points scored
during the past season. The Wildkittens’
leader scored 102 points, more than twice
as many as his nearest rival, to take first
honors in that respect.

In gathering the 102 points, Evans aver-
aged eight’ and one-half points a game for
the twelve Kitten contests. His total con-
sists of 41 field goals and 20 foul’ shots.
Rowan, Evans’ nearest rival, cashed in with
18 field and five foul goals for a total of 41
points; while Holland came in third with 13
field and eight foul goals, a total of 34 points.

Although the Wildkittens failed to break
even in games won, they had fair success,
winning games from Salisbury, Greensboro,

Annual Gymnastics

The annual spring gymnastic competition
was started last Monday, but as yet the re-
sults are not known.

Members of each of the four classes are
competing to give their class as many points
as possible. There are ten events on the
parallel bars, ten events on the horizontal
bar, eight on the horse, and eight on the
mat. The highest twenty scores will be taken
and the class which has the most men in
the first twenty will win, The man who com-
piles the largest number of points will re-
ceive a trophy. This trophy last year was
won by Frank R. Brown, of last year’s
Senior class.

At this time also measurements are be-
ing taken by Captain Pritchett to deter-
mine who in the student body has increased
most physically. The measurements which
are being taken now will be compared with
the ones taken last fall to determine the
winner. Anyone enrolled in the college is
eligible for this contest as well as the gym-
nastic competition. A beautiful silver loving
cup is to be presented to the winner of this
individual improvement competition. Last
year the cup was won by William J. Davis,
of the class of '33.

Both the loving cup for physical improve-
ment and the trophy for the gymnastic com-
petition along with athletic letters and other
rewards will be presented on Athletic Night
some time this month.

roster are

every afternoon down on Richardson Field |

now. The workouts are being confined at

present to warming up exercises, pepper ex- |

ercises, tossing the ball back and forth in
a lazy fashion, and some fundamental drills
in base runring. Captain Armfield has been

conducting practices recently, due to the ab- |

sence of both coaches, Younger and Laird.

But the coaches have returned now and the |

squad is expected to settle down into. stiff
workouts from now on.

Not much line can be, gained on any new
material as yet and so far the veterans seem
to have their positions pretty well sewed up.
But in the Sophomore ranks appear such
performers as Mills, Pearce, Peabody, Brad-

sher, and Bailey, who have been showing |

up well in the preliminary drills and show
promise of blossoming out as soon as real
work is begun. Mills especially has been ca-
vorting around like he is familiar with a
ball diamond and Jooks like he will live up
to all expectations. Pearce and Baily, pitch-
ers in the Sophomore ranks, have only been
warming up and as yet have not displayed
anything.

Among the veterans, Covington and Math-
is, outfielders, have been gauging long dis-
tance flys. Barnhardt and MeMillan have
been engaging in long pepper sessions, while

Indoor meet

With basketball season over, all that

Most of these came out last
Sunday. In looking them over, we noticed

state teams.
that Bill Goodson, flashy Davidson guard,
received high mention on nearly all of the
squads. Mathis made one second team,

as did Rusk.

Goodson was an almost unanimous
choice on nearly all the picks of the
sports writers we saw. He and Marpet of
Carolina were undoubtedly the two rank-
ing guards of the state. Of the two, it
| would be hard to make a choice for the

| first honors. Marpet had a little advan-
| tage in height over the Davidson captain,
but Goodson was a little better on down-
the-floor work and faster. Probably he
is a better shot from a distance, but Mar-
|ret would likely off-set this with his
‘height under the basket. The two are a
|nice working pair of guards.

|

| Rusk and Mathis were each mentioned
|as forwards .on second teams. Concerning
| Mathis, Wade Isom of the Charlotte
| News said he was the “most underrated
| player in the state.” He placed Mathis on

his “No. 2” team. Crowson, Gammon,
| Shaw, and Rose were the other men on
| most of the selections.

One of the changes in the new letter
requirements for all sports drawn up re-
feently by the athletic association is the
[granting of a minor sports letter to mem
| bers of the golf team. This recognition
}puts this sport on an equal basis with all

others at Davidson and gives it the spot

|which it has long been clamoring for.

|

| Golfers at Davidson have generally, in
| the last two or three years, been as high
‘ranking in comparison with their com-
petitors over the state as have the tennis
| players. Jack Pepper last year was medal-
list at the State tournament at Sedgefield,
and the Davidson team has always made
|a creditable showing

in their season’s

| record.
| The new requirements grant letters to
the four men who compose the team, pro-
vided their play has been such throughout
the year as to warrant it, and that their
general conduct has been satisfactory to
the chairman of the faculty committee on
| golf. We believe that this is a fair and
just settlement of a matter that has been
causing a

great deal of discussion ever

great extent upon how the present un-

ili not, and the Davidson staff becomes a
two or three man affair, things are apt to
be bad on some of the longer trips. It
may be so that the Athletics last

opinion that those two men had wonder-
