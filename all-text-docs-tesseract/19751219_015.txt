The Davidson Wildcats saw
the two faces of Lady Luck
this past week as they split
their games with Baylor and
East Carolina.

The Wildcats found out
what good luck was last
Thursday when they nipped
the Baylor Bears 88-86.

The game was close for the
entire forty minutes, with
Baylor’s eight point lead with
2:13 left in the first half being
the largest edge either team
could establish.

The Bears came out shoot-
ing in the first half, sinking
51.1 percent of their attempts
and dominating the offensive
boards. But the Wildcats,
although shooting an icy 39.6
percent, played aggressively,
and forced many Baylor mis-
takes. At the end of the first
half, despite their statistical
superiority, the visiting Bears
only led 48-44.

Davidson managed to

Freak predicts bowl results

(Continued from page 8)

Darrel Royal has problems
in bowl games just like the
Bear. Maybe he should have
picked his opponent also--
Southwest Baptist Teachers
College (almost as good as
Penn State).

With Marty Akins hurt,
look for Royal to bite the dust
one more time. Colorado sur-
vived the best conference in
the country with a 9-2 slate. I
like the Buffaloes by 8.

Gator Bowl, December 29,
Maryland and Florida. After
blowing it last year picking
Maryland over Tennessee in
the Liberty Bowl, the choice
here will be Florida with its
high-powered rushing attack.

If the Terrapins ‘can’t beat
Tennessee with Randy White,
without him, it’s the Gators
by 7.

Peach Bowl, December 30,
N.C. State and West Virginia.

The Wolfpack usually play
well in their frequent but
minor bowl games. In the last
two years, they have scored a

bundle of points in post-sea-
son action.

In his last college game,
look for Buckey to riddle WV’s
secondary time and time a-
gain. Since Buckey is the best
quarterback in the country
this year, I like the Pack by ll.

Sugar Bowl, December 31,
Alabama and Penn State.
Picking Bama by 21 last year
over Notre Dame was embar-
assing. I’ll stick with the
choke artists one more year,
but if the Bear loses this
hand-picked one, he ought to
join Shug Jordan in the retire-
ment ranks. Crimson Tide by
fe

Orange Bowl, January I,
Michigan and Oklahoma. To
many, this may be the nation-
al championship. That is, if
one is a Michigan fan. Aren’t
you tired of having a better

team than OSU and not going
to Pasadena?

-If Barry Switzer can cure
his team’s ‘‘fumblelitis” prob-
lems (13 against Oregon and 9
aginst Kansas), they should
squeak this one out. Oklaho-
ma by 3.

Rose Bowl, January 1, Ohio
State and UCLA. These two
have already played earlier
this season and the Buckeyes
swamped them 41-20.

If anything has happened
since then, Ohio State has

gotten better defensively. This -

predictor is not impressed at
all with John Sciarra. Ohio
State by 21.

(They wouldn’t dare throw
away an ice-cold national
championship. However, _ if
they do, look for Oklahoma
and Alabama to battle for the
first place votes.)

slowly edge out in front in the
final period, establishing a
60-55 lead with 13:57 left, but
the Bears’ Larry Spicer, a 6’8”’
freshman, personally erased
any thoughts of an easy
victory for the Wildcats by
scoring 12 points in just four
minutes, thus giving Baylor
back the lead, 67-64, with 9:35
to play.

Baylor maintained a slight
lead until Spicer’s tap in at the
2:32 mark, which gave them a
86-80 edge but turned out to
the last Baylor points for the
evening.

John Gerdy’s 20-footer and
an Eppa _ Rixey bankshot
pulled the Wildcats to within
two, and set the stage for a
steal and layup by Marvin
Lively with only :39 seconds
left. Lively was fouled on the
play and his successful free
throw put Davidson ahead,
87-86.

Baylor turned the ball over
on their last possession when
Sherman Patton committed an
offensive foul. Jay Powell’s
free throw with three seconds
remaining provided the final
victory margin.

Eppa Rixey and John Gerdy
both had 16 points for David-
son, while Jay Powell and
Marvin Lively scored 11
apiece and Pat Hickert added
ten. But the big key to the
Wildcats’ win was Tom Jor-
gensen, who not only pumped
in 12 points, but also had six
assists and no turnovers while
running the Davidson offense.
Rixey collected 11 rebounds to
lead the Wildcats in that
department. As a team David-
son hit on 43.5 percent of its

+

Wildcats split games

shots from the floor, and on
77.8 percent of its free throws.

In Saturday’s game versus
the East Carolina Pirates
Davidson ran out of luck as
the Wildcats’ late rally fell
short, leaving them on the
small side of a 85-82 score. The
loss gave Davidson a 0-2
conference record, and was
East Carolina’s first win of the
1975-76 season.

The first half was high-
lighted only by the sloppy
play by both teams, as be-
tween them they were guilty of
27 turnovers. ECU managed
to build up a ten point lead in
the opening period, but the
Wildcats battled back in the
final minutes before halftime
to leave the Pirates with a slim
39-37 lead at intermission.

Davidson, with two quick
baskets at the start of the final
period, jumped to its only lead
of the evening, 41-39, but the
Pirates did not let the Wild-
cats take control. East Caro-
lina ripped the Davidson de-
fense by hitting a blazing 70
percent of their second half
shots, many of which were
layups given up by the Wild-
cat press.

The Pirates controlled an
eight to ten point lead in the
last seven minutes before they
were challanged by the Wild-
cats in the last 59 seconds. At
that point, East Carolina led
by nine, 83-74, but Jay Powell
hit three shots to create some
excitement. Unfortunately for
Davidson the rally was too
little, too late. Tom Jorgen-
sen’s shot at the buzzer fini-
shed the scoring.
