Diplomat outlines Sweden’s view of superpowers

By AARON LEVINE

This week’s Open Luncheon
featured Erk Pierre of the
Swedish foreign service speaking
on “The Swedish View of Arms
Control.”

In explaining Sweden's neut-
rality, Pierre stated, “Small coun-
tmes are never happy with re-
lationships with big countnes. If
the major superpowers _ get
touchy, they could push a small
country about.”

Such a situation occurs when
the large superpowers get too
close to the small country. This
has been a problen for Sweden
ever since the early 18th century,
when Great Bntain and Russia
were the two big European super-
powers. Sweden has always tned
to keep her distance from super-
power conflict. The non-aggres-
sion pact between Germany and
Russia in which Russia was given

a “blank check” to take the Baltic
States and attacked Finland,
shows what can happen when a
superpower conflict comes into
contact with neutral areas.

This sense of neutrality is the
Swedish policy towards the arms
race. Sweden refuses to act in ac-
cordance with the nuclear policy
of either the United States or the
Soviet Union.

Realizing that only through
disarmament can neutral nations
have their rights respected, Swe-
den has taken the lead in arguing
far a comprehensive test-ban tre-
aty with an independent monitor
in Sweden. When this proposal
was first presented in 1977, both
the United States and the Soviet
Union rejected the idea saying that
such a treaty would prevent new
atomic weaponry from being
tested.

The Swedish involvement in
disarmament goes on. In the late
1970s a commission began to for-

mulate a plan, brought out in
1982, for a nuclear-free corridor
in Europe on the line between East
and West Germany. On each side
of the border, the free area would
be 150 kilometers wide.
Hopefullly such a plan would re-
duce the possibility of one side
triggering a nuclear exchange by
“not running a nsk of having a
local commander fire without pre-
vious political authorization.”
Unfortunately, the West Germans
deflated the idea by deploying nu-
clear warheads at the border with
East Germany, rendering the free
zone worthless. Yet the idea
sparked debate within NATO on
the nuclear free zone idea.
Sweden has also suggested a
similar zone in the Nordic area.
This would be beneficial for Swe-
den since they do not have a nucle-
ar force, and this plan, if put into
effect, would hopefully prevent
the Soviet nuclear fleet in the Bal-
tic from threatening Scandanavia.

However, as long as Denmark and
Norway retain their existing op-
tion of asking for nuclear weapons
from NATO if the need arises, the
plan would be ineffective. Swe-
den has no desire to criticize the
plans of the other Nordic coun-
tries, but hopes a final plan incor-
porating the desires of all three na-
tions can be worked out.

When asked of his opinion on
the progress of the nuclear arms
talks, Pierre stated, “I came to
Washington as an optimist; | saw
the Reagan Administration mov-
ing from-eaglier rhetoric. As I
leave Washington, I am pessimis-
tic and doubt an agreeement be-
fore 1988.”

Finally, when asked for the
Swedish view of Reagan’s “Stra-
tegic Defense Initiative,” Pierre
stated that it is considered to be
too costly, and would foil as a
population shelter. He believes
the S.D.I. talk will die down after
1988.

Public defender looks past crime to person

By LAURA GABEL
Isabel Day, public defender in
Charlotte, spoke on “How can you

Isabel Day

defend those people?” on Tuesday
night in the 900 Room.

“Who are these criminal de-
fendants?” Day asked. She
explained that “neighborhood
lynch mobs have a different idea ”
than she does.

Day said she has only repre-
sented one person who was truly
mean — a murderer. This is the
only person who has ever scared
Day. But her job is to look beyond
the criminal act at the person.
“Sheer meanness is usual,” she re-
called.

Day handles only criminal
cases where the defendant cannot
afford an attorney. Day pointed
out that the North Carolina Court
Commission did a study and dis-
covered that public defenders are
good, and perhaps even better
than private law firms.

Day categorized several crim-
inal defendants who are “poor in
terms of money, but not in terms
of spirit” as the “mercenary,” “the
one who got away,” “white
bread,” or “the Merita sisters,”
and “the life and death case.”

The “mercenary” is the guy
who makes as much money in a
week as Day makes ina year, and
tells her so. “The one who got
away” is the guy who, after she
won his case (he was accused for
driving with a revoked license),
drove off. The “white bread” is
the guy down on Kentucky Street
who sells drugs. She got him off,
and he went right back to selling
drugs.

“The life and death case” is
Beaver Camp, a young man much
like Helen Keller (he was retarded

and could not express himself).
He expressed himself by actions
and by crying. He eventually
killed someone and went to jail.
All he wanted was respect, and he
recieved that in jail because of the
attrocity of his crime, Day said.

Day said, “Long before the
crime is committed, we need to be
equally concerned with the people
like Beaver Camp as we are with
people like the president of the
college.”

Day’s reaction to “the one
who got away” was one of disap-
pointment: ‘He lied to me and |
was almost unaware of what was
happening. I certainly would do it
again. If they say they aren’t
guilty, I don’t have a problem
with that.” If Day knows that the
client is guilty, she tries to lighten
the sentence.

Eric Pierre

Pierre is the former political
counselor for the Swedish Em-
bassy in Washington, D.C. A
former journalist and an expert on
nuclear weapons and arms con-
trol, he worked for the Swedish
defense staff in security.

Some people attending the
talk were bothered by the fact that
Day defends even guilty people
Day explains, “I don’t act as a
judge over my client.” She said
she has never wanted to be a
judge.

“Prisons, to me, are useless.
but I think that this guy (“white
bread”) was out there with 100
other guys selling nickel bags of
marijuana to any white folks who
drive by. He’s non-consequential
compared to the big dealer in
Charlotte.”

Day feels that rehabilitation
programs are expensive in money
and in indivisualistic commit-
ment. She referred to a young ar-
sonist that has simply been
“warehoused” in prison with no
rehabilitation. “If he doesn’t get
noticed, he’ll set fires again.”

funding base for women’s sports
and addition of a women’s coach-
ing Position as two examples of
response by the Athletic Depart-
ment to the report presented to the
trustees. “The coaching position
in all likelihood will be a head
coach in volleyball who will have
additional responsibilities in the
department,” Morris said.

The Committee to Review the
Current Status of Women's Athle-
tics originated in Morris’ sugges-
tion to Kuykendall that the exist-
ing program be evaluated:
Kuykendall appointed the com-
mittee whose report the trustees
received. “Although itinitially fo-
cused on varsity sports, the com-
mittee broadened its comments to
include club sports and recrea-
tional sports. I for one view it as a
very good first effort in this area,”

The trustees approved an SGA
bylaws amendment replacing

dorm senators with eating house
and fraternity senators pending
SGA revision. “The trustees
asked that the senate clarify how
groups would be added to and re-
moved from the list of social or-
ganizations,” Sandy said. “They
(the trustees] liked the spirit of the
amendment but wanted to clarify
those two aspects.”

Informal discussion of current
self-selection policy led to the
Board's directing Dean of Stu-
dents Will Terry, the Council on
Campus and Religious Life
(CCRL) and Kuykendall to estab-
lish a 1986-1987 self-selection
calendar. “The Board gave the
Dean, President and Council
(CCRL] a green light on designing
a rush program for Patterson
Court,” Terry said. The board will
receive this program recommen-
dation at its October meeting,
Terry said.

In other business, the trustees
adopted the pr posed Strategic

Planning Document; they also
drafted resolutions honoring Busi-
ness Manager Bob Currie and
Zimmermann. Currie retired this
year after 28 years as business
manager, Zimmermann will be-
come Dana professor of History
after a sabbatical next year follow-
ing his resignation as vice presi-
dent for academic affairs and dean
of the faculty.

Students Against Apartheid
wrote an open Letter regarding
college investment policy in
South Africa, read by the trustees.
Chairman of the Board Ben Craig
said, “The Finance Committee of
the Board of Trustees will have an
Open meeting on campus at which
time they'll hear from students,
faculty, and administration about
their attitude toward the College's
investment policy.” Craig said
this forum will probably be held in
September, with the trustees’ re-
Ceiving response during the Oc-
tober Board meeting.
