Blue Devils End Cat Streak, 89-72

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Managing Editor

Davidson’s six-game win-
ning streak came to an abrupt
halt Wednesday night as the
Duke Blue Devils made a
strong surge in the late stages
to smash the Cats 89-72 in
Cameron Indoor Stadium.

Chris Redding, a 6-8 forward

from Bethesda, Md., came off
the Duke bench before the five

minute mark to replace Willie _

Optimism Runs High
For Outdoor Track

By TOM TORNEE

Although the Indoor Track
schedule has yet to be com-

pleted, preparations are now
being made for the outdoor

season.
Amidst wood and up-
turned dirt that mark the

the same as the 100, with each
sprinter adjusting to the extra
mileage.

In the quarter (the 440),
Martin will be relying again
on Connors for most of the
points. He also looks for Hal
Paul and a trio of freshmen,
Carl Crenshaw, James
Douglas, and Dave Wolter to
round out the scoring in this
event.

final quarter to take the win.
The Blue Devils are now 8-7 on
the year.

Duke's 999th all-time vic-
tory ended a winning streak of
six games for Davidson, who
had also won nine of its last
ten. The string included last
Saturday's 78-76 win over
Wake Forest.

Junior center-forward
Larry Horowitz led the Cats in
that win, scoring 22 points and
grabbing nine rebounds.

The Duke contest was
marred by fouls, as the Cats
were called for 28 violations.
Three players fouled out for
Davidson, including Jay
Powell, T. Jay Pecorak and
Larry Horowitz.

The cats led in the reboun-
ding department, 34-32, just
committed too many fouls and
too many turnovers, leading
the Blue Devils in the latter
category, 29-19.

The Cats also had one of
their worst nights from the
field as they shot only 44.2 per-
cent, hitting 27 of 61. Mean-
while, Duke hit 30 of 58 for 51.7
percent

Duke's center Bob Fleischer
picked up his third personal
foul with 8:53 to play in the
game. Sheldon Parker then

. tied the game, converting one

of two free throws, making the
score 63-63. But Fleischer
scored three easy baskets and
Kevin Billerman added a 20-
foot jumper and two free
throws in the next two minutes
for a 73-63 Duke lead.
Davidson called time-out to
try and cool the surging
Dukes. But the Blue Devils
kept driving, outscoring the
visitors 5-1 in the next minute
for a 79-64 lead. It was all
downhill after that.

Redding’s performance was
one of his best this season and
it came at a very opportune
time for Duke. He connected
on seven of 11 from the field
and 12 of 15 from the foul line
for his game-high total.

Fleischer was a dominant
factor under the boards as he
threw in 16 points, including
eight of eight from the charity
stripe, and hauled in 12
rebounds. Greg Dunn and

Mike Sorrentino paced in Cats
with 19 and 18 points, respec-
‘ively.

Foul shooting was a plus for
Davidson, tage-wise
anyway. The Cats hit on 90
percent of their free throws,
making 18 of 20 attempts.
Duke hit only 78.4 percent, but
that figure came from a 29 of
37 performance, which proved
to be quite a factor in the vic-

Duke led by as much as 13 in
the first half, but the Cats
came back, outscoring the Big
Blue 26-10 over the next span
of time before Duke settled
down and managed a three-
point halftime advantage at
41-38.

The Cats record slipped to
12-6 overall, which virtually
kills any hope of a top-twenty
ranking for them this season,
barring upsets over both
Notre Dame and N.C. State,
the number three and two
teams in the nation, respec-
tively. Davidson travels to
cnallenge the Irish in South
Bend tomorrow night.

Cat Female Tennis Prospects

Spark Frank’s Expectations

By TRACY CHARLES
Staff Writer

Even if it weren’t for the
unusually fine weather, the
women’s tennis team would be
out on the courts early next
week to start their official
spring practice.

Jeff Frank, coach of both
the men’s and women's
teams, finds it difficult to
give : the new women’s team
the individual attention and
coaching that they warrant.

first year team they are sur-
prisingly strong.”’

Referring specifically to
Mary Miller, Dea Booth, Bec-
ca Stimson and Sue McAvoy,
Goldsborough said, ‘‘the girls
are very consistent and have
amazing strength.”

Strong doubles com-
binations and an aggressive
approach are’ Frank's
primary concerns for the
women this spring. Although
Dea Booth sees the team ‘‘as
pretty umnaggressive on the
court”’ she herself is viewed as
a very physical and poten-
tially dynamic player.

“‘The seven members of the
team are very much in-
dividuals,’’ said Gold-

sborough. ‘‘We are all very
close and are good friends, we
simply need to work up a
cohesiveness of style, a team
relationship.’’.

WHAT-a-BURSER

MOORESVILLE, N. C.

Frank noted that one of the
big changes ‘‘will be changing
seven individual players into
three strong doubles com-
binations.’’ Frank counts on
aggressive doubles ‘‘to sur-
prise a lot of women’s teams
who are not used to this style

The team’s schedule is
initiated with a match with
Hollins, to be played at
Davidson on March 15. Other
schools to be played are
U.Va., Mary Baldwin College,
Furman, Duke, U.N.C., and
Queens.

Goldsborough is anxious
about the large universities as
their number and scholarship
funds outrank Davidson, but
says she expects ‘‘we will
walk over schools like Agnes
Scott, Pfeiffer and Queens -
Mary Baldwin and Hollins will
