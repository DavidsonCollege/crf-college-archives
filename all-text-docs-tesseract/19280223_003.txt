PROMPTED FROM THE BACK

SEAT _ 13 ONE PE cING

The driver of a Ford sedan, who
was plainly out of his element in
city traffic, attempted to tum
around in the middle of a block,
and was side-swiped and upset by
a hook and ladder fire truck on
its way to answer a call.

Striding over to the overturned
vehicle, a traffic officer poked his
head through the broken window
and ‘demanded, “What do you mean
by blocking traffic like this? C’mon
outta there; you’re pinched!”

“You let him alone!" said a fe-
male voice from the back seat.
“How did we know them drunken
painters| were going to run into
us?”

SORROWS OF A STONE AGE.
STENO

The boss came in with a peach
of a grouch. Tossing his club into
a corner he bellowed:

“Take a letter to the landlord.
‘Dear Sir: This is the last time I’m
going to ask you to get this place
fixed up period unless you have
that flock of saber-toothed tizers
chased out of the next cave before
the end of the week you can start
looking around for another tenant
semicolon I’m tired of trying to
get anything done with those this-

and-that cats yowling all day.
“Oh, Mr. Ug! Please don’t go
so fast! I’ve already broken my

best chisel and smashed three fin-
gers!”

very outstanding men on the campus in every
way. ‘fe was captain of baseball and has-
ketball, and was an all-state man in both
sports. He was all-South Atlantic in basket-
ball. Besides this, he was president of the
“Y” and an O, D. K. man. After graduation
he was coach for Gastonia High School, and
avas very successful while there. He iis at
present coach for Guilford College, this be-
ing his first year there. He has played for
both Charlotte and Greenville, in the South
Atlantic baseball league, and was sold to'‘both
Louisville and Chattanooga, but refused to
play for these teams because of Sunday
baseball. He is at present under pending
contract with the New York Giants, who are
very anxious to secure his services.

Pat is one of the best examples of fine
Christian manhood that could be found, and
the “Y” feels that vespers this week will be
one of the best ‘services of the whole year.
By all means hear Pat—without a doubt it
will be well worth your time. This is a
great opportunity, so make the most of it,
and turn out for “Y” next Sunday.

ENE,

There are still some books left from the
shipment that came in the other week, and if
you boys have not as yet looked over this
lot, do so. There are many valuable vol-
umes in them, that many fellows could use to
great advantage. Drop by and ask to see
them.

Just as a matter of statistics—150 men
heard Dr. Ben Lacy’s appeal for the minis-
try as a life work.

And over 100 men had interviews with the
various visitors during the week. Resu'ts
such as these are very gratifying to the “Y”
and its officers, and make them feel that the
“y” is meaning much to the student hosy.
