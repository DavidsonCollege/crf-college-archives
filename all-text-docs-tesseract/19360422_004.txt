BASEBALL vs. SOFTBALL

There is much discussion at pres-
ent about whether ‘fraternities
should play baseball or softball this
year. At present, the sport man-
agers from the various lodges are
conducting polls to determine each
fratern ty’s stand on the question.
Present standings that the
regular national pastime will be
in vogue for the fraternity man this
season,

show

Lamont Brown, who will conduct
this column next week, has just had
another honor bestowed on him. He
has been named in Grier Martin's
vacated post to supply the newspap-
ers of the state with Davidson's
news. He ought to have some swell
inside dope next week. Whew, now
for a two weeks’ lay-off while these

ex-editors work again.

In Athens, Wednesday, they meet
the University of Georgia for the
second time this season. For the last
three days of the week they will
be playing in the Southern Inter-
collegiate tourney, slated to be held
at Athens. This should be a highly
successful trip as the Cats have al-
ready proved that they are better
than Georgia and Wofford. In the
Southern tournament last year they
finished in sixth place and should
do better with the same team back
again. Besides the regular team of
Captain Bill Snow, Charlie Ross,
George Cowan, and “Jelly” McClel-
land, Hinson Maples is making this
trip and will play in the tourna-
ment.
