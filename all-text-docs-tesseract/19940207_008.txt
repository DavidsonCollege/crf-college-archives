sleep, and I see him. It’s almost
like he’s following me around.

His prom picture sits on my
desk, and in it he smirks the way
only heknewhow. Wehad doubled
to the prom that year, and remem-
ber how nervous he had been. On
my shelf sits a 5’x7’ of him. He
looks over his shoulder before a
soccer game; I didn’t know then
that his’soccer days were num-
bered. As I flip through:a photo
album, I see another picture of
him. This one makes my stomach
ache. He’s with the guys, smiling
and tan. The guy behind him has a
t-shirt on that says “Thy time hath
come.”

My last words to him were

terribly sarcastic. I had no reason
to say anything different; we were
always in the midst of a battlé of
minds. I happened to have the last
word this time. I didn’t realize a
simple sentence would haunt me
for the rest of my life. But it has.

The news came at five in the
morning. My brother, my strong
and self-assured brother, awoke
me with a spastic shake.. | couldn’t
focus for a few seconds.

As I came to, I saw he was
crying. And quietly, in a voice 1
could barely understand, my
brother said that he was gone. 1
shouted at him to shut up, to quit
lying, toleave my room. Heturned
and left.

I tried desperately to sleep
away the nightmare. I willed my-
self to ignore the news, but I
couldn’t. Finally, I got out of bed
and went into the room where my
brother sat with a list of people his
parents had given us to call. I sai
beside him, silent. And soon the
room began to fill up with friends,
teammates, schoolmates, and ri-
vals. I merely sat, observing. Fi-
nally, when I could take it nolonger,
I retreated into a small cornersof
my house to yell at him, to plead
with him, to make the pain go
away. It didn’t happen.

The day wore on slowly. I
went to his house to be with his
family, all of our friends, and many

people I didn’t know. We shared

stories, tears, and our fear of losing
yet another one of us to drinking
and driving. We were struggling to
grow up, and we were killing our-
selves in the process.

His girlfriend lay in my lap
crying helplessly. He died in the
midst of their first fight, a fight
because she couldn’t express her
love for him. She was screaming it
now. I had never heard such pas-
sionate tales of love. The thought
swirled around in my mind that
declaring love after the fact was
something no one should have to
face. My last words had been
sarcastic; hers had been bitter. We
were both battling with it now.

rang through the room. And boys,
forced to become men as they
donned the responsibility of being
their best friend’s pall bearers, wept
like infants. I walked up to his
open casket and stared at him. His
shirt was buttoned all the way up
and I fought the urge to unbutton it
the way he wore it. I bent down io
give him a final kiss and to apolo-
gize for the words I had last spo-
ken.

The funeral was on a beauti-
ful, cold winter day. The church
was packed; the mourners spilled
out into the yard. Girls sat with
roses in their hands and the guys
sat with tears streaming down their

I am woman.

As I’m sure all of you know, I
have very few conversations with
women on this campus. I’ve
thought about the reasons why most
women won’t give me the time of
day, and I cannot find an answer.
Since this is my last semester here
at Davidson, Idecided that it was
high time to find out why it is
impossible for me to hold the at-
tention ofa girl for more than three
words,

I tried to get an explanation
from a girl, but she just punched
me after she told me to stop staring
at her behind. I was desperate,
and, as they say, desperate times
call for desperate measures.

Horror of horrors, I decided to
do something that is more terrify-
ing to men than mice to an el-
ephant. No, more scary than an
elevator to a claustrophobe. No,
more scary than sleep to an insom-
niac. Oh, never mind. You get the
idea.

I attempted to get in touch
with my feminine side. Yes, I
know it’s horrible, but that’s just
how desperately I need to be loved.
I had no other alternatives. I was
confident that in doing this I would
be able to find out the answers to -
all my questions about women.

I started by watching Anne of
Green Gables. It didn’t take. Iwas
asleep before ‘the first tape was

while drinking pot after pot of cof-
fee. I made it the whole way
through this time. I didn’t under-
stand it, but I thought that I could
feel asmall spark of estrogen cours-
ing through my veins. It was the
beginning of something magical.
The next movie I popped in
was Pretty Woman. I knew I was
making progress because I could
tell that Richard Gere really did
care for Julia Roberts. The last
time I saw this movie, I thought
that it was one of the most over-
rated, silly, and—yes—anti-femi-
nist movies ever made.
Well, maybe I have seen a
movie or two with John Holmes
that could be construed as slightly

‘More anti-feminist. But you get
the idea.

I was so proud of myself that
I decided to take the next step. I
went to the library and got every

icssection, Istarted reading acomic,

that has been much neglected by
those of us with only one X chro-
mosome: Cathy. I couldn’t be-
lieve it. I was laughing out loud at
Cathy’s misadventures. I even oc-
casionally spoke to Cathy: “Oh,
Cathy, you ate all the ingredients
todinner again? Hahaha! You’re
killing me! Ho ho ho!” I could
really identify with her trying on
those bathing suits. You can tell
that men design those things.
After my experience with
Cathy, I decided that I was ready to
take that final drastic step. I picked
up a copy of Revolution From
Within by Gloria Steinem. That
book changed my life. My self
confidence improved, I found that
I was asserting myself much bet-
ter, and I no longer felt I had to
have a husband to define myself.
At last I did it!

‘me that !had come full circle. My

feminine side was alive and kick-

‘ing. I needed to celebrate.

I wanted to show the world
that I had accomplished what few
males on the planet ever have: I
understood women. I actually felt
emotions. I watched a whole epi-
sode of Little House on the Prairie,
(an accomplishment in itself), and
I didn’t once think of seeing Mel-
issa Gilbert’s pictorial in Playboy.

Anyway, I decided to look like
how I felt on Saturday. Yes, I
dressed as a woman. I found this
scrumptious dress and slipped it
on. I must admit, it looked stun-
ning on me; I just knew that I
would turn heads that night. I put
my hair in pigtails and hit the party.

My feminine side abandoned
me the second a girl touched my
arm. I guess it must have been the
fact that girls don’t touch me every
day. I was shocked. I was soon
reduced to a slobbering, insensi-
tive male. The change in sex
seemed to go unnoticed by the
women at the party. I am wearing

a dress to every party I ever go'to

for the rest of my life. I was
brushed, touched, hugged, talked

to, laughed at, and generally ac-
_-knowledged by more girls on Sat-

urday night than in my entire 22

- years of life.

my feminine side went. But the
‘important thing is I found how to:

get girls to talk:to me. While the
chances of my dress-clad body
enticing a girl back tomy room
remains as small as ever, I did get

Now if I could just get in touch ...

Nah, never mind. .

Drugs are
growing in
America.

“For the first time in more
than a decade, drug use among
junior and senior high students has
been rising rather than falling.”

This is a quote from the front
page of the February 1 issue of The
Charlotte Observer. Gary
Blonston begins what could have
become an inspired piece of jour-

~ nalism, but never goes much fur-

ther than base facts.
Many of these facts are sur-

, prising, nonetheless. Illegal drugs,

on the whole, are increasing in
popularity among teenagers. It
turns out that the one drug for
which esteem is still diminishing
is tobacco, and less high school
seniors smoke than did a year ago. °

Also, the group least likely to
experiment with controlled sub-
stances is blacks. According to
Donna Shalala, “They, more than
any other group of young Ameri-
cans, know what the consequences
are of drug use.”

The other young Americans
who are not as wise comprise 31%
of the total young American popu-
lation. This figure is significant
because it is an increase from last
year, but one must take into ac-
count the number of one-time us-
ers that figure includes—those ner-
vous rebels who drop acid once
and scare themselves. so'bad that

ally informative, but if you want a
