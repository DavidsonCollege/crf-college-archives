Prospects for Infield and Outfield
Are Good, But Very Few
Dependable Pitchers

With a long, gruelling schedule facing
them the Wildcat baseball squad has al-
ready begun workouts in the battery de-
partment and the rest of the squad is
expected to swing into action soon. A
number of pitchers and catchers have
been warming up stiff arms slowly, while
the sun has been bearing down but no
hard work is expected until the latter
part of next week or maybe further off
than that. The complete strength will not
report until spring football

staff held up fairly well under the strain

of trouble. Although there is a wealth of
infield material none are adept third bag-
gers. It remains to be seen how Coach
Monk will patch this up. The outfield
seems fairly well fortified but there is a
dearth of applicants for the job at pres-

Davidson Nine Will
Meet Fifteen Foes

The Davidson nine will meet fifteen op-
ponents this year on the diamond, six at
home and nine away from home with a
possibility of a game before the spring
holidays. This year the team will only
meet teams of the two Carolinas, making
four trips in all.

Game Cancelled

Failure to secure a sufficient num-
ber of contests to make a trip
through North Carolina successful,
has caused the William and Mary
College freshman basketball team to
cancel its engagement with the Da-
vidson freshmen.

The game, which was to conclude
the Wildkittens’ 1931 schedule, was
to be played on the local court to-
morrow night. However, with the
cancelling of this contest, the Wild-
kittens have brought their season to
a close in climatic win over the
strong Charlotte High quintet,
which has been undefeated previous
to its visit here.

The cancelled game would have
been the first meeting of the fresh-
man teams of the two institutions.

Without the service of Captain Bill
Goodson, Star guard, and Bruce Peabody,

cats invaded the Palmetto state, and were
able to win only one of the three engage-
ments. The first’ game of the trip, that
with the U. of S.C, was won 35 to 26,
but games were dropped on the following
nights to The College of Charleston and
to Citadel by a two point and then a one
point advantage.

Over Previously Undefeated
Team

A scrapping Davidson Freshman bas-
ketball team kept a strong Charlotte High
offense well covered to win by the score
of 17 to 11 last Friday. It was the first
defeat of the season for Charlotte.

The-Wildkittens put up the best game
they have played this season, particularly
on defense. They held Charlotte to two
field goals in three quarters. Charlotte's
passing game was well worth watching
but their men were too well covered to
shoot successfully.

And those are all the coming events
that will cast their shadows over David-
son’s campus for another two weeks or
so. Of course, there is the daily sandlot
basketball game, but one who calls that
a sporting event is, well, to say the least,
careless of the strict truth. It’s lots of
fun, however, _ :

Another thing’ to the
from their studies is the occasional-in-
vasion of Davidson by various girls’ bas-
ketball teams. But as.ave don't know who
and when they play, we'll have to leave
the chroncling of those events tg the
Drug Store window. You don’t see very
much basketball there, anyhow.

Varsity basketball had its finale last
week, Neither team has had a howlingly
successful season, but victories over their

final opponents would leave a good taste
it our mouths to carry over into the dry
month of March.

The varsity’s auspicious start back in
January was somewhat eclipsed by the
results of last week’s games. We can’t for
the life of us reconcile those defeats to
poor basketball. A team shot with injuries
as Davidson was on the South Carolina
trip can hardly be expected to play win-
ning ball..That, however, doesn’t go for
the Duke game.

The inspired game turned in by the
in defeating Charlotte High
School—the first time this year any team
has done that—was one of the best bas-
ketball games seen on the local court
this year. We say it was inspired because
the Wildkittens were certainly playing
far over any form they have shown at any
time previous. Bob Evans was all over the
court at once, it seemed, and deservedly
was the high point man of the game.
More power to Coach Laird for the fine
team that he has developed this winter.

admitted Davidson had the better team;
for the night at least.

You may take the scrimmage games of
football any way you like, but we prefer
to look optimistically at them. True, no
outstanding back has been uncovered, but
those lines don’t look so awfully bad.
There are three or four men in there who
were not on the varsity first string last
fall who are set on making it next year,
and they look like pretty good chances to
do so.

Backs, however, are none too plentiful.
Don King turned in two or three nice
plays Saturday, and handled the team in
a-manner that was satisfactory. McQueen
scemed to be in his old time form, and
backed up the line ina hard-driving man-
ner, West showed promise of futuredeeds.
The punting of Barrier, a lineman, was
high, wide, and handsome.

The decision of the Davidson coaches
to use a shift next year came as a surprise
to a number of the spectators. No inti-
mation of ‘the proposed hop in the signal
calling had been mentioned in pre-training
dispatches. Personally, we like it. Aside
from all tactical reasons and all that, it
looks good to see a backfield come out of
a huddle, bark out a few signals, shift
smartly to the right or left, and then
smash off tackle.

The addition of Davidson to those who
follow in the footsteps of Knute Rockne
—Rockne is the father, supposedly, of the
shift and is the most famous proponent of
it in the modern game—will mean that
at least three of the Big Five teams will
utilize it next fall. Chuck Collins of Caro.
lina has already said he will return to the
full Notre Dame shift. Clipper Smith, new
N. ©. State coach and former Irish All-
}American, already has his Wolfpack hop-
ping in order to get onto the idea.

Come to think of it, Wake Forest used
a shift last year, too. It is modified, we
think, from the true Notre Dame style.
Whether or not Duke Freshmen used a
shift with their wing-back formation has
slipped our minds at present, and we
don’t recall whether Wallace Wade used
it at Alabam’ or not. He will likely have
enough other innovations at Duke to keep
the customers talking without the added
necessity of whether his Blue Devils will
