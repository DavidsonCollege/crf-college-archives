‘to come out next

week after many delays

‘By ROY FULLER
Staff Correspondent,

. The College Directory, which
has been delayed for several
reasons is scheduled to arrive
next week for distribution, ac-
cording to Communications Di-
rector Martha Roberts.

Roberts is responsible for the
directory, which includes the
name, address, and phone num-
bers of all students, faculty,
and staff. Roberts admitted
that the publication is behind
schedule, but she said, “It is
not really substantially later
than usual.”

The Directory has usually
appeared sometime during fall
term.

According to Roberts, there
are three major reasons why the
directory has been delayed.
“First, the process of getting
the phone numbers is complex
and very time consuming,” she
said. A list must be posted for
some time in the Union to
gather the names of all students

~ using each phone.

Second, the process was ham-
pered when the list was torn
from the wall and lost. After
this incident, the entire proce-

dure had to be repeated.

The final factor causing the

delay involves the printing
company. Roberts said the
printers aré slower than usual
this year. She attributed their
slowness to a business slow-
down and layoffs at the com-
pany.

Roberts offered several sug-
gestions to allow earlier publi-
cation of the directory. She said
that a compulsory meetingcould
be held in which the needed data
could be collected. If that could
not be arranged, she suggested,
“Perhaps some service organi-
zation would volunteer to help
collect the information.”’

Roberts said, ‘‘Accumulating
the material is the biggest cause
of the slowdown. If we had a
faster way to collect the data,
the directory would be out much
earlier.”’

Union Director Shaw Smith
said he was very glad to hear
that the Directory will come out
soon.

Requests for students’ tele-
phone numbers keep the Union
telephone lines constantly tied
up, thereby ‘falsely making it
look as if we aren’t doing our
jobs,”’ Smith said.

Grades are out.

lish a comprehensive guide for
pre-medicine, pre-law, and pre-
ministereal students. Both the
course survey and the guide will
be mailed to rising freshmen in
the same envelope as the fall
term sign-up sheet.

The committee has designed
a form for the course survey

_ which will be completed by

department chairmen. The form
does not evaluate either profes-
sors or courses. Rather, it

describes course workload, spe- _

cifying the number of reviews,
the length of papers, and the
amount of studying to be
expected in a given course,
Odom said.
