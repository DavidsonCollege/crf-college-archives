Martin: ‘Lot About This|

Place I Don’t Know’

By CHARLES CHASTAIN
Davidsonian Associate Editor

“There’s an awful lot about this place that [ don’t know,” Davidson College/ gf

President D. Grier Martin told the DAVIDSONIAN staff in an interview in his of-

fice Tuesday morning, before answering their questions on the problems and ac- 7

complishments of his new administration. The following is the text of the interview:

ing of that kind necessary for
longer than a very temporary
period. We intended to have
this year about 890 to 895 stu-
dents. The way these things
work these days makes it im-
possible to know what you'll
have. We had to go by past ex-
perience and accept a_ large
number of applications.

Based on past percentages,
we would have had a freshman
class of 250 students. Another
factor in the number we now
have is the number of people
who come back out of the three

dormitory immediately.
Question: Does this have
anything to do with the

Trustees’ idea of increas-
ing enroiiment to one
thousand?

Answer: Yes.

Question: Then we made

a bigger jump than in-

tended?

Answer: Yes. We planned to
increase enrollment this year
to 895. Nobody had an idea of
going as high as nine hundred,
which would be thirty more
than last year. The plan was to

High Enrollment Fills

Classes Pa

st Capacity

By ERVIN S. DUGGAN
Crowded classrooms and lack of dormitory space

plagued college authorities and students as classes

opened on Wednesday. With the highest enrollment in
Davidson’s history, officials are faced with housing an

overflow 915-man student body. Classrooms are filled

all these factors worked out to Question: Are we going

930.

Question: Are the Trus-
tees thinking of going up
even further, say to 1200
or 1400?

Answer: You can’t speak for
54 men. The present limit of
one thousand was reached by
a joint committee of Faculty
and- Trustees, and we might
have gone higher without the
opposition of some of the. Fac-
ulty. The policy for the time
being is for one thousand stu-
dents. We are now planning
programs, including the Dana
Science Building and the new
dormitory, in that direction.

These programs all will be
co-ordinated to take care of
one thousand. If we go beyond
one thousand there are so many
areas to be changed that I don’t
think we would.

Question: Is anything go-
ing to be done soon ebout
the science building?
Answer: We are hopeful to

break ground on the science
building in the next two weeks.

Question: Has the loca-
tion of the new dormitory

beyond capacity.

Gymnasium showers and lock-
er rooms were utilized last
week to house over 30 upper-
classmen. The college guest
house and numerous private
homes are being opened to pro-
vide student housing, with 64
members of the student body
rooming away from the college
campus.

Mrs. Rethal Moore, supervisor.
of dormitories, expressed con-
cern regarding the lack of cam-
pus space. “I feel sure, how-
ever, that rooms will be avail-
able by the end of first semes-
ter,” said Mrs. Moore.

Crowded conditlons In class-
rooms brought sharp complaints
from students and faculty. Sec-
tion enrollment in some classes
went as high as 90, with some
students forced to find seats on
radiators and. classroom floors.

The overflow cnrollment, ac-
cording to college authorities,
was caused by an increase in
upperclass enrollment rather
than in the size of the incom-

ing freshman class. Freshman
class size is estimated. at 257,
three higher than last year. The
enrollment of exchange  stu-
dents and an influx of returnees
were said to account for the ov-
erflow.

A 1957 mandate of coilege
trustees called for an increase
in enrollment at Davidson to
reach 1000 students by 1960.
Proposed new facilities to meet
the demand, including a science
building and dormitory, are still
in project stage.

Both the scienee building and
proposed dormitory are sched-
uled for construction beginning
in 1959. Initial funds for con-
struction were contributed by
Charles Dana, president of the
Dana Foundation. ;

Meanwhile, faculty members
and college administrators at-
tempt to ease campus crowding
by shifts and balancings in class
enrollments and room _assign-
ments until all students are pro-
vided for.

been decided?

| Answer: No. The only ideas
seriously proposed are to have
it in the lot opposite Belk
across the road, in the area be-
tween the Union and Duke, or
in the present parking area
next to Belk.

Question: What about the
size of the faculty? If we
want to keep the same fac-
ulty-student ratio, wouldn‘t
we have to hire more pro-
fessors?
Answer: We will have to hire

new professors. Whether we
would have to. have enough to
keep the same ratio, I .would
fe The areas which would

have small classes could absorb
some additional students to
make up for overcrowded areas.
For example, geography — I
assume we would not have to
add another professor there.
Many people think that. the idéa
of faculty-student ratio is
exaggerated. and that somé sub-
jects could be taught as well
in large classes. That way pro-

Davidson’s 915-man enrollment forced over thirty upperclassmen into the gym. These
students attempt to study on their floor-level bunks in a shower room. College officials
hope to remedy the situation in the near future.

A real compliment was paid
by one of the freshmen who
commented that the parties
“seemed mighty good because,
like everything else here, they
have been planned to perfec-
tion."

Below are typical freshman
comments on this year's Rush
Week:

Jeff Couch--“Although they
have been pretty hectic and a
new experience for me, the par-
ties have been a lot of fun. I
find it hard to meet all the
members of’ the larger fraterni-
ties and to remember the names
that belong with familiar faces
when I see them again on cam-
pus.”
