Renee Hicks: Bald Ambition Tour.

Bald ambition floors the 900 Room...oe

Comedian Renee Hicks keep students laughing with her wit and humor

Renee Hicks is not bald. She
is not funny looking in the least (as
all the fliers suggested). Okay,
that was.a bit of a let down. But
there are some who call her ...
funny? Yes, yes! She WAS funny!

Renee Hicks, the mahogany-

American comedienne, (ooh that
sounds nice!) who stood up fortwo
and a half hours (give or take an
hour) and told jokes last Saturday
night, was, uhh, pretty good. Her
flights of improvisation blended
well with her bawdy, prepared
material and gave the evening a
feeling of spontaneity.

For instance while discussing
the way-out names our fellow ma-

hogany-American female counter-
parts give to their offspring, she
had only to ask Ms. Good’s first
name to prove her point. Next time
your Commons’ meal tastes bland
Hicks advises throwing in a pinch
of Nurica. We agree!

And her insights into college
life were harsh, if not entirely truth-
ful and painfully funny (would any-
one disagree that “frat” doesn’t

stand for “Fellows Reeks of Alco-
hol and Testosterone”? We cannot
find fault in this!)., ;

Her atypically long perfor-
mance was appreciated by all in
attendance, since there was not a
lot else to do in Davidson, as Hicks
reminded us throughout the
evening. How ironic then that she
provided us with such wonderful
entertainment.

Confessions from the H.O.R.D.E.

Rusted Root, Lenny Kravitz, Blues Traveler convene in Blockbuster Pavilion

By Mary CLiareE JALONICK
Executive Editor

I must confess — I enjoyed
the H.O.R.D.E.

Amongst the wanna-be (fill in
the blank) Dead-follower-grunge
fadeout-hippie-stoner-
teenybopper really-cool-13-year-
old crowd, I enjoyed the music.
An eclectic mix, the three groups
on the main stage at Blockbuster
Pavilion — Rusted Root, Lenny
Kravitz, and Blues Traveler —
gave the crowd enough variety to
stave off the usual all-day concert
burnout.

I had been to the H.O.R.D.E.
in Dallas this July, and the Char-
lotte concert proved to be much
better. Dave Matthews (who did
not play in Charlotte)had played
excellently, but the Dallas concert
was held on a drag racing track —
need I say more? It was also about
105 Fahrenheit, hot enough for
Kgavitz to begin the opening chords
of “Love” and then stumble off the
stage in a sweat-induced delirium.

Thus, my appreciation for the
cooler night at Blockbuster Pavil-
ion, not normally a standout venue
but appropriate for the occasion.
The grass was perfect for lounging
and chatting as the concert played
on, and the concession area was
big enough to purchase a gyro,
falafel, pork (“the other white

meat’) skewer, BoJangles sea-
soned fries (big hit with our group),
or beer without standing in line.

To the point: Rusted Root
was good, basically playing the
album as is and forcing us to all
confess that, yes, we really did just
wantto hear“‘Send me on my way,”
and that other song that all of us
knew. No one really got up and
danced, but it was fun anyway.

I have seen Lenny Kravitz
three times in the last year, and I
believe that he is one of the best
concert performers out there. His
sexy, on-stage hair thrashing is not
monotonous but entertaining —

adding to the screaming, whining,.

sensual affair that he has with the
audience. ;

His performance Thursday
was no exception — even though
we could only see him as a dot in
the distance, we were up and danc-
ing as he rocked the night away
with old favorites. He got through
“Love” this time, and went on to
end with “Are You Gonna Go My
Way.” Fabulous.

Blues Traveler does not play
radio at their concerts. They do
long sets with previously familiar
tunes, giving their music a fresh
sound. John Popper expels so much
air playing serious harmonica that
one expects him to keel over —
even watching him on the big
screen takes effort. But the har-

Lenny Kravitz.

James Calderaro

monica sessiohs often seem
drowned out by the excessive use
of guitar in the extended sets, caus-
ing me to lose interest after a while.
They were good, but when they
left the stage I wasn’t screaming
for an encore.

The second stage also hosted
some fun bands, most notably Taj
Mahal. Their acid-jazz sound was
a crowd pleaser and a good intro-
duction to the afternoon.

H.O.R.D.E. was cheesy but
fun, tiring but interesting. I
wouldn’t be surprised if these
superconcerts. (founded by
Lollapalooza) don’t fade out soon
— it seems like all of the novelty
has been extracted by the “been
there, done that” mentality (tatoos,
piercings, etc.) — even by the
teenyboppers. But whatever your
statement, your purpose, your hair
color — it was a fun evening.
