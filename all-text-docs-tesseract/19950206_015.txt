Women’s b-ball suffers wrath of Marshall

By Bryan ALLISON
Staff writer

With a tough loss at Marshall
last Monday night, the women’s
basketball team finished the first
half of its Southern Conference
schedule winless.

Butas the team moves into the
remainder of its schedule, it sees
many positive signs that should
point to better results in the future.

“What has been encouraging
is that we’ve played everyone in
the conference well,” coach John
Filar says. “‘What’s frustrating is
that we haven’t been able to get a
as ass

The Marshall game was par-
ticularly disheartening for the
Wildcats, as the Thundering Herd
was missing several players to
injuries. The Wildcats were led by
Kristen Ferrucci, who had the best
igame of her Davidson career with
23 points and 11 rebounds. Monica
Winter contributed 4 assists and 4
rebounds while shooting 3 for 4
from the field. :

At the half, Davidson was
down by 11 points. After falling
down 14 with 16 minutes to go in
the game, the Wildcats fought back
to cut the lead to just four with
eight minutes left before eventu-
ally losing 88-77. “It was an op-
portunity that we let slip away,

Wresters come home after weekend

By JOHN ROE
Staff writer

Last weekend, the Davidson
wrestling team traveled to Atlanta
for two days of intense wrestling
against some of the best teams in
the country.

Saturday, the team went up
against Duke and Georgia Tech
and hoped to get in some matches
against national powerhouse Ohio
State, which is currently one of the
top 20 teams in the nation. Sun-
day, the squad faced James Madi-
son and Georgia State.

“This is the toughest wres-
tling we will see all year,” coach
Tom Oddo says. “Georgia State
will break the top twenty this sea-

son, but if not, they will certainly
be in the polls by next year.”

Going up against teams of the
caliber of Ohio State and Georgia
State can only make the Wildcats
better.

Tough matches like these pre-
pare the team for the most impor-
tant part of the season: the South-
ern Conference tournament.

Davidson, however, is not
healthy right now. “Half of the
team is sick, and we have some
borderline injuries,” Oddo says.

Standout Jesse Kenner has an
injured foot, the extent of which is
still being determined.

“There is-a possibility of a
fracture, but we will see how it
feels this weekend and make a

decision next week,” Oddo says.

The team will hopefully nurse
itself back into shape for the tough
competition ahead. A full and
healthy lineup is essential for suc-
cess in the conference tournament.

This weekend, the Wildcats
finally return home to wrestle
Longwood and conference rival
The Citadel.

These conference matches are
especially important because head-
to-head competition records deter-
mine the seedings for the tourna-
ment. :

The wrestlers are looking for
some strong support this season so
they will be well on their way toa
successful season’s end.
