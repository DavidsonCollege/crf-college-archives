Adequate evaluation awaits instigation

By CHARLES ERWIN
Asst. Features Editor

Finding @ fair and valid
way to evaluate professors and
the courses they teach is a very
complex problem, not only at
Davidson but at other colleges
across the nation.

The student government is
not satisfied with its new course
evaluation forms because they
feel they are not receiving
enough response for statistical
accuracy.

They ‘‘want to in-
stitutionalize the system,’’
according to SGA President
Thom Young, so that students
will either have to fill out the
forms or signify that they don‘t

want to respond.
The Professional Affairs
Committee, a faculty

organization, is not satisfied
with this kind of form, ac-
cording to Dr. David Kaylor
who chairs the committee,
because they are concerned
about just what criteria
students use _ in _ their

evaluations.
He feels that important
factors such as_ student

motivation and the time of day
each class met were ignored in
the forms.

Also Kaylor is concerned
that the forms may have a
weakening influence on the
curriculum. He noted that many
reputed crip courses received
high marks on the last tabulated
evaluation and that professors,
overeager to improve their
marks, might make their
courses easier.

The administration, ac-
cording to Academic Vice-
President Frontis Johnston, is
not satisfied with using the new
forms as a means of evaluating
professors.

He frankly conceded, ‘I
think faculty evaluation is the
hardest job of this office.”

Despite the wide disparity
of interest, each of the three
spokesmen agreed that there is
a clear need for student input
into faculty evaluation.

Students are in many

respects the best sources of

evaluation because they are the
ones who are directly affected

_ by teacher quality.

Young listed three reasons
why an objective statistical
form can have value as a
student voice. It would be an aid
to incoming freshmen; they
should have help in. selecting
their fall term courses so they
know just what they’ll be get-
ting into.

Students already at
Davidson should have better
means of selecting courses and
a forum to air their feelings on
courses they’ve already taken.
Professors need to be shown
how to improve their per-
formance.

Kaylor said that the op-
tional in-depth SGA form was of
a bigger help to professors in
getting student input than the
statistical form. He recom-
mended that professors make
out their own questions to give
to students, asking for in-
formation ‘particularly ap-
plicable to their individual
courses.

Although he defended the
SGA’s right to distribute their
forms he was opposed to their
being adopted by the ad-
ministration.

The academic _ vice-
president needs _ faculty
evaluations to help determine
which professors deserve pay
raises, promotions, or tenure.
In many respects tenure is the
crucial aspect of evaluation.

Once a professor is given
tenure it is nearly impossible to
break it, although Young in-
sisted that professors could be
discouraged into leaving by
having their pay raises con-
sistently overlooked.

Evaluation, including
student input, should provide
the means of firing incompetent
professors on tenure, according
to former SGA President Bo
Baskin.

The new evaluation forms
are not the first used at
Davidson. Student Instructional
Report forms were used by the
administration up until the fall
of 1975.

Under this system a student
had to turn in a completed SIR

_student_ w.

course evaluation form before
he could take the exams.

According to Dr. Johnston,
in. many cases it was clear that
the students were not taking the
poll seriously.

On some forms, the same
result column would be marked
all the way down the sheet. For
this reason he did not object to
the SIR’s abandonment.

Students were never
allowed to see the results, since
Johnston maintained that
publication would make the poll
meaningless for his use.

Young was against the SIR
forms because he believed that
students should have been
allowed to see the results. He
was in favor of it being aban-
doned also.

It was Kaylor’s committee

which recommended to the
faculty that the SIR be rejected.
The faculty concurred. The
faculty was disturbed, he said,
that the purpose and use of the
form was never clearly stated
by the administration.

They were concerned that
the form might be carrying
undue weight in determining
their promotions.

The old form failed. There
is no assurance that the new
form will fare better. Perhaps it
will be better to wait and see
how the incoming Academic
Vice-President feels about
evaluation and then work out a
program.

But as Young said,
“Positive things are coming
about,” and they shouldn’t be
thwarted.

Proposal:
The Davidson College academic climate

lacks the freedom and. innovation to
guard agianst stagnation

Solution:
Upgrade the independent study programs

Re-evaluate the grading system
Re-evaluate the major requirements

Reinstigate effective course and faculty evaluations
Make Davidson students take their input

into decision- making seriously

Support the Center for Special Studies
Make area requirements meet liberal arts standards

To graduate, Davidson
College students must take at
least two religion courses. All
but four of the courses offered

_ are of Western religion.

This requirement came into,

-effect in 1968 when the college

adopted the new curriculum,
according to Registrar Richard
C. Burts. Before that time a
four semesters of religion to
graduate. .-

‘One objection sought’ in

the new curriculum was
flexibility,” said Burts. ‘In
order to provide this flexibility
the college butressed itself by
allowing people to take a
variety of courses in area
requirements.
_.. “I think everybody felt that
as a church related college
‘Davidson had an obligation to
help students achieve the study
of religion from a_ non-
_evangelistic standpoint.”

requirement of two religion
courses as “a reflection of our

past curriculum. We are trying
to hold on to something
Davidson had and something
they want now.’’,

He does not think the
requirement affects either the
application of non-Christians or
the satisfaction of non-Christian
students. :

“Davidson does not try to
convert a Jew here, so a Jew
does not feel put ‘upon. The

unoffensive because they are
academic and not persuasive,”
he said. — ee

Davidson is not a college for
everybody,’ Said Burts, “If we
were a college for everybody
and if we Were sponsored by
everybody the requirement
might not be in effect.

“But were sponsored by a
religious Organization.
Davidson has decided this is
going to be its pitch.
