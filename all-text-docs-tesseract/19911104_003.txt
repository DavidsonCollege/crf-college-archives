Jefferson award for this year.
Williams also announced the
formation of the Richard R. Ber-
nard Society of Mathematics.
Twenty-seven students were in-
ducted into this new honorary
society that is intended to bestow
a special honor on departmental
majorsand others with interest and
outstanding ability in mathemat-

to 100,000. Out of all of these
applications only 150 scholarships
are awarded.

Pritchett stressed the value of
a Davidson education in his ad-
dress and he pointed out the
“importance and great quality of
Davidson professors.” He said, “I
believe that Davidson has repeat-
edly challenged you (Davidson
seniors) and you have repeatedly
met that challenge.”

Pritchett spoke about the Coca-
Cola fowndation and its dedication
toeducation. Pritchett said that his

The Atlanta Project,a program
originated by former President
Jimmy Carter to help solve prob-
lems of the urban poor, was also
brought up by Pritchett during his
address. . Pritchett said that Carter
feels that “he must try” to raise
Americans’ conscious level and
increase awareness of the home-
less problem. Pritchett quoted
Carter when he said; “The failure
is if we do not try.”

Since Davidson students have
been blessed with opportunities that
others haven’ t had, Pritchett noted,
they must maintain a sense of re-
sponsibility for others. He said,
“Make the best of f your life and put
it to optimal use.”

Pritchett also did not fail to
mention Davidson students’ par-
ents and talked about how parents
have shared in the Davidson expe-
rience and will be grateful to the
college for launching their chil-
dren into a happy and successful
life.

In closing out his address,
Pritchett mentioned the book “Oh,
the Places You'll Go” by the late

~ Dr. Seuss. He commented on how

this book has special relevance to
graduates. He:then said, “Oh the
places you’ ll go,” and added to the
title by saying, “...and the things
you'll do.”

Pritchett then congratulated the
seniors and wished them good luck
in their future.
