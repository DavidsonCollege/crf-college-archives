THE DAVIDS

ONIAN

| Slants

-On-

By JOHN JOHNSON

Davidson sports fans want very much to back a team that
consistently wins and they should definitely have one in the
Wildcat track team.

The 1957 edition of the cindermen is missing two record
holders from last year, sprinter Phil Koonce and javelin man
Harley Smith, but still has enough able returnees and new-
comers to rank strong. Coach Whittle feels his boys are prob-
ably even stronger than last season.

UNOFFICIAL

hee om is in the unusual position of having men that
£55 d hold school records in four of the events.
In the weights Bill Gramley is putting the
shot and throwing the discus better than
ever before at this time in the season.
In the indoor track competition he putted
the shot 45 feet, just two feet short of
his record and well above the 43 mark of
this time in 1956.

GRAMLEY

In practice Gramley has already unofficially broken
the school record in the discus with a heave of 147 feet.

Pete Ashcraft, of course, is the big point getter for the
thinclads. Phe senior from Amherst, Mass., already holds the}
record in the 880 and the mile run and has been improving
every year. Coach Whittle referred to Ashcraft as ‘‘. . one of
the finest runners I have ever coached. He could have his
best season this year.”

TO WATCH

Whittle also picked soph Angus McBryde as a man
to watch, saying, “He wouldn't surprise me if he cracked
the two mile record.” McBryde, who placed third in the
Southern Conference cross country meet, also hurls the
javelin.

|

Sprinter Mel Armstrong who ran second to Koonce last
year has accepted the burden of responsibility that Phil's
graduation has laid on his shoulders and responded amazing-
ly well. Already Armstrong has run the 100 once in 10.1 and
once in 10 flat. The lean speedster has also been experiment-
ing with the low hurdles.

LOST AND FOUND

The Wildcats were hindered last year by the lack of a
high jumper but have found a bright ray of hope in John
Huie, a freshman from Albany, Georgia, who has cleared
over six feet in high school.

Last year’s record holding mile relay team of Roswell
Mallory, Al Elder, Pete Ashcraft, and Phil Diuguid lost the
fourth man but has picked up a freshman, Brownie Thurman,
who is reportedly faster than Diuguid.

Commenting on the coming season Whittle said, “We
ought to do as well as last year (7 wins, 2 losses). Richmond,
Clemson and N. C. State will be our toughest opponents.’’

ide Tub Coach McKee was enthusiastic |
in his -praise of the squad |
“They're really shaping up as ay
team,” he said |
McKee added that the |
team’s main forte was its
evenness. “No one is clearly

number one,” he commented.
“The boys all are about equal,
a solid team. The addition
of Mintz, who alternated at
one and two last year, later
on in the season will
strengthen us even more,”
he continued.

The Coach was particularly free
with his‘ praise for his number two

doubles team of Harry Broome
and Tom McCutchen, comment
ing that they are his best at this
time.

The team seeing action this
weekend will probably consist of
Robinson, Huffaker, Pearsall, Me
Cutehen, Broome, and Martin or
Hodel.

The netmen begin their spring
|tour March 29 when they journey
| to Columbia to meet the South
Carolina Gamecocks. The follow:
ing day they meet The Citadel
| and then travel to Jacksonville
for two matches.

;counters on the home court are:
March 23—George Washington.
March 25—Cornell.

April 17—South Carolina.
April 19—Univ. of Illinois.
