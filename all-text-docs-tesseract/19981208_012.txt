Women turn it up, capture tournament

By Mike: ANDERSON
Sports Editor

They’re back.

The Davidson women’s basket-
ball team reestablished themselves this
weekend,
rolling past
Bucknell
and Eastern
| Carolina
University
on their
way to a third consecutive Roundball
Invitational Tournament championship.

Jamie Brown captured the Most
Outstanding Player award for the tour-
nament, and junior point guard Jen
O’Brien joined Brown onthe All-Tour-
nament Team.

“Jamie Brown stepped up big in
both games,” praised Head Coach John
Filar. “She is so explosive. If I was a
coach having to defend her, I don’t
know what I'd do. She can hurt you in
sO many ways.”

Resounding answers.

The wins could not have come at a
more crucial time. “At this time last
week,” described Filar, “we were prob-
ably lower than when we came back
from the Southwest Missouri game. The
fact that we lost to Chattanooga (the
previous Saturday) the way we did, we
had a lot of questions to answer.”

Answer they did, knocking off
UNC-Charlotte before winning two
more games in tournament action this
weekend to piece together a three-game
winning streak.

Davidson faced Bucknell in the
semi-final game on Saturday afternoon.
The Wildcats jumped out to a 15-6 lead
in the first five minutes of the game and
built that lead to 50-36 by the half. For
the first time this season, all fourteen
players saw action, and thirteen of them
scored. Jen O’Brien led the team with
22 points, while Jamie Brown added 20

The right stuff.

O’Brien’s resurgence was a beau-
tiful sight for fans of Davidson'basket-
ball. “Jen was a lot more confident
today,” explained Jamie Brown. “In
this game, she looked for her shot more,

Hassel came off the bench to assume

and the offense didn’t miss a beat. “She
brought us a nice spark,” said Filar.
O’Brien added, “JoAnne came in and
really played well, she did an awesome
job. She’s such a solid player.”

E.C.U. entered the game with a

against E.C.U.

At times, though, the at-
mosphere at the game seemed
more along the lines of aWWEF
match than a college basket-
ball contest. E.C.U. Head
Coach Dee Gibson was
ejected with two technical
fouls, while almost poking
holes in our hardwood floor
with her stomping high heels.
The unsportsmanlike conduct
was not confined to the bench.
One E.C.U. spectator was es-
corted from the arena after a
verbal altercation that esca-
lated into a melee when the
man began choking a
Davidson senior. “It was a wild
atmosphere,” noted Filar.
“Two years ago as a younger
team, we’ dhave probably got-
ten so caught up in that. But
when all that junk was going
on, our players were so focused. They’re
avery determined bunch that have their
heads on straight and they did a great
job of letting those distractions go in
one ear and out the other.”

The Wildcats have remained per-
fect in the tournament, claiming the
championship in each of the three years
since its inauguration. “This was the

Team—all conferences that are ranked
higher than ours—I don’t know if we’ ve
ever had as good a week as we just had.”

Depleted ‘Cats roster struggles in Virginia

In their first meet since mid-No-
vember the Wildcat swimming and div-
ing team (2-5) took on Lehigh Univer-
sity, the University of Delaware, and

- William & Mary at Hargrove Military

Academy. For both the women and the
men the meet was characterized by
mixed results. While both teams de-
feated the University of Delaware by
61 and 94 points respectively, they both
experienced tough defeats at the hands
of Lehigh and William & Mary. “I
think we did very well considering some
of the team is sick and we are struggling
through exams,” said freshman Gra-
ham Gravely. “We tried to overcome
that and perform well.”

Individual standouts for the ‘Cats
included Graham Gravley, Terry Dolch,
Kurt Hirsekorn, and Sam Kuykendall

Va., took second in the mile, 66 lengths
of the pool, with a time of 16:38. “I feel
I’m progressing as the season goes
along,” said Gravely. Also, junior Terry
Dolch won the 100 and 200 yard back-
strokes. Sophomore Kurt Hirsekorn
and junior Sam Kuykendall also had
solid meets as Hirsekorn won the 400
yard individual medley while taking
second in the 200 breast stroke by .48
seconds. Kuykendall took second in the
200 fly.

On the women’s side junior Mary
Shell Broshe had an oujstanding meet
for the ‘Cats , claiming victory in the
200 and 400 yard individual medleys.
Junior Beth Wilson won the 100 breast
stroke, while sophomore Elissa Weddle
took first and third in the 50 and 100
