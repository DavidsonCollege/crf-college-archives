- Holmes

Continued from page sy

of it. Iam stuck with itas much as
the Court and the students, so we
have to learn to work through it
together. There’s a lot of stuff
about the policy and interpretation
that just isn’t clear and we’re all
going to have to work through it.

Davidsonian: Having worked at
other colleges, do you believe al-
cohol is a bigger problem at
Davidson?

Holmes: I don’t think its a bigger
problem by any means. My most
direct experiences have been with
institutions very similar (to
Davidson). Allegheny Collegeand
Washington & Jefferson are both
small, private liberal arts colleges
with aselective group. I have seen
that category of students.

Davidsonian: What role do you
foresee Patterson Court playing
this year and in the future? Do
you think student social inter-
ests will shift from Patterson
Court towards the Union or off-
campus?

Holmes: I guess I can’t answer
whether it will or not, its going to
depend on what happens in the
next year or so and that’s why I say
I would like to be pro-active in my
work with Patterson Court. Idon’t
think there’s any.reason that it has
toshiftandI don’tthink thatthere’s
also any reason that that couldn’t
be a good thing for the Court.
Having the Outpost down here is a
link, the statement can be made
that you don’t have to go exclu-
sively to Union eventsor youdon’t
have to exclusively go to Court
events. Youcan do some of each.
I would like to have an opportunity
to work with the Court more on
some of those all-campus things
sponsored by the Court (such as
Lunar Luau) so the Court can re-
main an integral part of the social
life. But, it will have to change. It
can’t be the place where people
say “When we want to getalcohol,
that’s the place to go.” I don’t
think itshould be that kind of thing.
As any house member down there
should fecl, and I’m not sure they
all do, you should be known for
more than just the place to party.
Each of the houses offers a lot of
leadership opportunities, and a lot
of other social interaction opportu-
nitics that you don’t get in many
other areas of campus life. Those
things ought to be what’s stressed,

encourage those things and those
kind of interactions. :

Davidsonian: Many people have
not really seen you and do not
you who you are, do you plan to
have a visible role on campus
and how much will you interact
with students?

Holmes: [hope to. I madea joke to
some people that all I’ve talked
about for three weeks is alcohol.
As soon as I get a chance to do
something else, I’ll be happy and I
think that people will recognize
me and see me a lot more. At the
same time, Davidson doesn’t have
a history of live-on staff members.
I come from an institution that has
five staff members and adminis-
trators living on campus. The last
thing I want to be perceived as is -
infiltrating or trying to stick my
nose in too far into what students
do. Ithink there’s a great history of
student autonomy at Davidson and
I wouldn’t want to be scen as im-
posing myself too much. So, I’m.
not racing to get too visible. I
guess visible is the wrong word,
visible yes, but you don’t want to
be intrusive.

Davidsonian: How do you think

the alcohol policy is working af- -

ter these past three weeks?

Holmes: If I had to do an evalua-
tion right now, I would probably
not give it more than about a 65 or
70 percent. That’s mostly because
we have had so much to adapt as
we go. The first party we were
probably down around 30% effi-
ciency or effectiveness. There are
areas that the policy, as it was
written, didn’ taddress because they
weren’t issucs of concem. The
whole area of BYOB wasn’t cov-
ered. So, when people were doing
BYOB parties, they were very hap-
hazard - we didn’t know what we
were supposcd to be doing, we
didn’t know whatkind of monitors
we should have or what they should
be doing. So those I think are the
Negative points of the policy be-
cause students don’t know. The
worstthing youcan have isa policy
that’s undefined and very cryptic
and no one knows exactly how
they are supposed to react to it. I
find that students really just want
to know what the system is, what
the rules are. They’!l finda way to
work with it, they’ll find a way to
deal with it. They may not be
happy with what it says, but they
are intelligent enough to know
what’s going on in society.
People’s complaints seem to be in

. out-of-class_ learning.

an arbitrary nature of it, and while
I don’t think its arbitrary it is kind
ofamorphosis rightnow. It is kind
of undefined in certain areas and
that’s the toughest problem. I fig-
ure another week or two and we'll

be running pretty close to perfect.

Davidsonian: What do you be-
lieve are the biggest problems
with the alcohol policy?

Holmes: Aside from a perception
that it is doing more than it is, I
don’t think that there is any one or
two that stand out. I think the
perception with the students right
now is that the policy is trying to
make the campus dry and in no
way is that true. But, that can lead
to a lot of antagonistic stances be-
tween the way people think its
going and the way Some of us who
are working with it are trying to
operate. Problems? There is prob-
ably a lot of inequity between how
closed house parties, open keg par-
ties, and BYOB’s are dealt with. 1
think right now there are so many
varieties of parties out there that
there are parties where you could
argue you get away with more, I’d
hate to think of one house pitted
against another saying ‘They’re
getting away with something that
we’re not allowed to,’ or “We're
being hammered when they’re be-
ing let go.’ I think its really just an
issue of types of parties. We’re
getting there and we’ll get those
inconsistencies worked out. The
other problem is the perceptions of
Student monitors by the student
body. That’s a real problem be-
cause the way tomake this work is
to let the students have control of
the system. If they don’t have the
authority, the responsibility, and
the autonomy to control their own
lives as a student body, then we’re
mitigating and taking away a lotof
whatacollege is supposed to do by
I_ would
much prefer to have all student

thonitors, but we know that puts’

too much pressure on students to
cite their peers, so we have to have
this mix. I’d hate to go to all
officers, because students wouldn’t
fcel comfortable in that position.

Davidsonian: Any other comments
about the alcohol policy?

Holmes: As much as I complain
about having talked about it for
three weeks straight, I’ve said to
Patterson Court and really to any
student group or the campus in
general that I’m available. If a
house wants to have me down for
dinner or post-dinner some evening

to talk about it or to get my percep-
tions of it, those are the kinds of
thingsI’dlike todo orneed todoso
that we are all working on the same
wavelength. I’ve suggested to a
couple of people that maybe we
need to do something along the
lines of a fireside-chat on a bigger
scale or forums of some sort. Re-
ally we need to do some sort of
information sharing. The door is
open if people have questions.

students back with her this sum-
mer. “I am delighted to be here. I
am looking forward to the small,
personal classes and educating un-
dergraduates.”

Coursen

Continued from page 1

Coursen asserted.

Other components of the ac-
cord failed, especially under the
country’s military umbrella. In fact,
Coursen fears that the greatest
threat’ to a continuing peace pro-
cess is the military. They “don’t
like the peace accords [and] may
even be plotting a coup d’etat.”
The immediate danger lies in a
growing “‘dirty. war” where death
squadrons are becoming common
aggressors.

Coursen reminded the audi-
ence that the government signed
the agreement with the FMLN,
ignoring the military and
landowning private sector. The
exclusion of these two important
groups within El Salvador’s polar-
ized society severely limits any
hopes for further peace initiatives,
The FMLN will next attempt to
earn basic human rights within such
a tense setting.

Returning to Central America
in October, Derek Coursen hopes
to monitor El Salvador’s progress
from his thission seat in Guate-
mala.
