The elections for these of-
fices will be held next Mon
day.

In addition. ali three de-
feated candidates for SGA
vice-president are running for
junior class senator.

Only two to six members
of the initial 12-man Senate
will be former Council mem-
bers, due to no incumbents
filing for junior class senator
and only one for sophomore
class senator.

Since each class will elect
three senators, this means
that at least five senators,
plus the freshman advisers.
will have had no previous ex
perience.

So far, only former council
members elected are the
president and vice president
cf the SCA.

Union, encouraging students
to sigh up. They were chosen
on the basis of interest and
acceptance of responsibility.

The Council had planned to
choose the court Monday
morning, but had to adjourn
for lack of a quorum.

The court will replace the
old Student Body Regulations
Court and will hear cases in
volving infractions of the stu-
dent body regulations. Mem-
bers serve for an_ entire
school year and are ordinar.
ily chosen in September.
There is one member from
each dormitory.

In a special ceremony pre-
ceding the meeting secretary
Sam Darby pinned a yellow
star on Peter Hobbie. signi-
fying the best attendance
record of any Council mem-
ber.

David Ginn then presented
a report on the role of eight
Davidson students at the
Model United Nations last
week. He called the assem-
bly of delegations from va-
rious colleges ‘‘very worth-
while for the students involv-
ed’ and said it ‘‘helped Da-
vidson's image a lot.”

He suggested that the dele-
gates be chosen in Novem-
ber next year instead of this
spring and that the official
literature be sent directly to
them. He said training in po-
litical science and economics
was very useful to those at-
tending.

After this report Fletcher
Hartsell presented an account
of the trip he and three other
students made to the State
Student Legislature in Ra-
leigh last week. He called it
‘ta worthwhile forum for stu-
dent government leaders
across the state.”

“We knew more than we

did last year about the pro
ceedings,” said Hartsell,
‘‘but we were unable to sub
mit a bill because of a com
munications failure.’ He said
many state political candi-
dates were present ‘‘because
it is election year.”

The Council was interested
in the two trips because
funds were provided for the
delegates from the Student
Council budget.

Freshman President Steve
Engstrom advised the Coun-
cil that the report on the Na
tional Student Association
Conference on Educational
Reform was being revised
because it represented the
partial opinions of the dele
gates. Engstrom, Franklin
Anderson and Harrison Hig
gins were the delegates.

22 Counselors

Due For Halls

Twenty-two rising juniors
and seniors were selected
Wednesday to serve as fresh-
man hail counselors next
year.

For the first time, the se-
lection committee ruled that
hall counselors mayfnot serve
as fraternity rush chairmen.

Mrs. Peter Nicholls, di
rector of student housing.
said that the committee tried
to select ‘the, best men for
the job. Fraternity affilia-
tion is the last thing consid-
ered.”

Student members of the
committee, with one excep-
tion, supported his selection
procedure. Mrs. Nicholls
said. She pointed out that
the committee made no at-
tempt to distribute hall coun
selor positions evenly among
applicants belonging to var-
ious fraternities.

A bbott’s Adaptation Of ‘Bartleby’
Is Image Of Man’s Loneliness

A REVIEW
By DIRK GALBRAITH

It was a characteristically
small house which saw the
Red and Black Masquers
present Herman Melville's
“Barbleby"’ Thursday eve-
ning in Hodson Hall. yet the
applause was large. and de-
servedly so.

In adapting Melville for
the stage. Dr. Anthony S. Ab-
bott got at the heart of what
that precursor of existential
thought was trying to say
about ‘man alone, and in do-
ing so presented the audience
with a superbly engaging
stage dialogue which was not
Melville’s but his own.

persons was the subject of a
meeting of the trustee com-
mittee and its 6-man faculty
advisory committee March 7
in Charlotte.

The student aavisory com
mittee of Tom Earnhardt.
Bobby Lane, Joe Kilpatrick
and Rich Cowart was not in-
vited to the meeting.

The trustee committee did
not receive the student
group's list of suggested
names until the day of the
meeting, Lingle said. and
therefore felt the students
“would be wasting their

time’ to come to the meet- —

ing.
' “The primary source of in-
formation about these people
is academic channels,’ he
said. ‘This is what was dis-
cussed at the meeting with
the faculty. But it's a route
not open to students.”

So far the student commit-
tee has submitted three
names, Earnhardt said. Sev-
eral names will be submitted
soon, he said.

‘; can assure you that
we're going to do our best to
get complete information
about every candidate that’s
being put up who looks like
a likely person.”’ Lingle said.
“But we're going to have to
make our own judgments
about how we're going to do

NOT 1
NOT 2

that.”

The student committee de
clined comment on not being
invited to the meeting.

The discussion over the
Presbyterian. requirement
was prompted in part by the
student committee, which has
said it favors dropping the
restriction.

The restriction, which is
contained in the trustee by
laws, narrows the field of
possibilities, Earnhardt said
this week, since Presbyter-
ians represent less than 20
per cent of all American
Protestants.

But Lingle, noting the large
number of current college
presidents who are Presby-
terians. said:

“I think if you've got a lot
who are already Presbyter-
ian presidents you must have
a lot of pepole who are Pres-.
byterians who aren't presi-
dents who are potential pres-
idents.

**Also I think anybody would

be hard put to say that the
college has failed to have
good presidents up to now be-
cause they've been limited
to Presbyterians.

“I think the Presbyterians
that they've had have been
pretty outstanding men and
very successful presidents.”

In focusing his drama upon

In Harcourt. he has created
the character of one who
