By ‘RICHARD WILSON
Asst. anaging Editor

Repre ntatives.’ from: five—

national fraternities decided
Tuesday night to hold a
rush program for freshmen
during the winter term.

:. The group also made an

unwritten agreement that
bids would not be given out
to freshmen until the ambi-
guilty of the present situa-
tion ‘is Clarified.

“The feeling is we want
to have a rush in order to
give freshmen the oppor-
tunity to join a fraternity,”
said Jim Cantrelfa spokes-
man for the group.

The five houses announced
that they will hold an_ in-
formal open house Nov. 5
and Nov. 18 during which
freshmen will be _ invited
down to discuss - fraternities

and the social system at Da-
vidson.
“Our purpose. in having

this open house is to explain
to the freshmen our opinions
on what the new system
would be like,” he said.

The. fraternities involved
are Alpha Tau Omega, Phi
Delta Theta, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Sigma Nu; = and
Sigma Phi Epsilon.

In a meeting with fresh-
men in Hodson Hall Wednes-
day, Vice President of Aca-

Buchanan Sees ‘Charity Economy’

By ‘DAVID HANIG
Staff Writer
““A-social- order- which al-
lows parasites to exist with-
in it faces destruction unless
it’ establishes limits on the
numbers of parasites. Mod-
ern man has been, thus far,

incapable. of preventing his —

exploitation by the parasites.”
Thus Dr. James M. Bucha-
nan, professor of economics

- .MODERN'

and director of the Center
for’ .the Study of Public
Choice at Virginia Polytech-
nic Institute, stated the pro-
blem of the charity-giver
and the recipient.

Buchanan spoke Wednes-
day on ‘The
Dilemma,” which dealt with
the problem of deriving the
maximum social value from
charity.

MAN AND P

Samaritan’s ~

The Samaritan-can either
give or not give; however,
his utility function (his na-
ture) requires that he give.
The parasite knows this and
will try to get as much as
he can,’’ Buchanan said.

The tendency in Western
culture, according to Bucha-
nan, is for the parasite to
live entirely off the charity
of the: Samaritan. ;

RASITIES

James Buchanan describes the plight of The Good Samaritan.

“The parasite knows that
the Samaritan could _ not
bear his starving to death,
so the parasite stops work-
ing and usually receives in-
creased charity,” he said.

The best situation, he sug
gested, was one in which
the parasite works and re-
ceives charity. To maintain
this situation, the Samari-
tan must decide to withhold
all charty if the parasite
does not work.

“Since the Samaritan can-
not stand the suffering of
the parasite, the only way
that he can resist the tempt-
ation to continue giving is
to rely on a rule which
would be invoked automati-
cally without thought,”
Buchanan stated.

Buchanan decided that
people directly involved in
the parasite’s situation, like
social workers, ought not to
decide who will’ receive
charity or not because they
are the people most actual-

’ ly caught in the Samaritan’s

dilemma.

“If the Samaritan sac-
ceeds in keeping the para-
site at work,”’ he said, ‘‘any
parasite .who follows the

“first one will know that they

have to work.”

Society, as a while, ac-
cording, to Buchanan, has
been unwilling ‘to force its
parasites to work.

vassing, as®’ we really don’t
have enough people to cover,
much bigger an area” Ayres
said. “By election time, we
will have been to just about
every house in Concord.

“We've had around 17
different guys working on
the campaign at different
times, and others have ex-
pressed an_ interest,” . coni-
mented Ayres. ‘Our. turn-
out has probably been hurt
by the lack .of a charismat-
ic liberal candidate—the is-
sue here is getting a real
arch-conservative out of of-
fice.

“Because of our limited
numbers and time, we have
stressed the brief approach,
where we hand out a pam
phlet, but do not push the
issues, We answer questions
if asked, but the most ef-
fective means of campaign-
ing we can contribute is that
of making as many people
as possible familiar with
Blue’s name and = candi-
dacy,” Ayres added.

‘*‘ Tt seems as though we've
having a good effect in the
campaign. The reactions
we've received have been
surprisingly favorable.

“T can count the cases on
one hand where we have en-
countered a bad reaction
from people,” Ayres said.
‘And in most of these cases,
the people, if hostile, were
hostile toward the political
system and candidates, not
toward the students.”
