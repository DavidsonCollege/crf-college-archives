The Water Engine’s study of a century of illusory progress

By JON BOLES

and SUZANNE CRAYMER
Take everything you hear in this show
with a grain of salt. Things are not what they
seem. David Mamet’s play, Mr.. Happiness
and the Water Engine, studies a century of

illusory progress.

The setting, a Chicago radio station in

1933 during the Century of Progress Expo-
sition, ties together the two “scenes.” Mr.
Happiness, Jim Dillon, and Miss Happi-
ness, Donna Peters, bring Dear Abby onto
‘the ‘airwaves. Mr. and Miss Happiness
glance over a few select letters and con-
clude that all of mankind’s problems boil

down to five simple-conflicts: traumas of —}

the heart. These two characters are insin-
cerity personified. The saccharine voices of
Mr. and Miss Happiness convey their lack
of concern for the people they are supposed

‘to be helping.

The Water Engine begins with a confus-
ing deluge of characters and skits. Charles
Lang (Carey Rowan) presents a mechanis-

Bill Cosby

By JOHN HARRIS

How refreshing it is to hear a
comic who doesn’t feel it neces-
sary to use the “f-word” every ten
seconds! Bill. Cosby’s concert
film, Bill Cosby Himself, pays
tribute to one of America’s best-
loved funny men and the fact that
you don’t need blue humor and
four- six- and twelve-letter words
to get laughs.

Unlike some other comics such
as Eddie Murphy, who quickly
shot to fame via his Saturday
Night Live exposure, his charis-
matic. presence, and the sheer
audacity of his colorful though
mostly substance-less material,
and Richard Pryor, who often re-
lies on his own faults and addic-
tions as sources for his tragic,
albeit often brilliant,‘ material,

man (Bill Sutton).

Cosby tackles primarily family
issues. He comments (lengthily, I
might add,) on the topics of natu-
ral childbirth, (“...but the father
can have all [the drugs] he
wants!’’) the ups and downs of
child-rearing, smoking, and his
various laugh-at-yourself views
on minoratrocities of Everyman’s
life. Most notable, however, is his
routine on the visit to the dentist.
You need to make a point of see-
ing that one particular bit, at least.

Which: brings us to my next
point, that of needing to see only
part of the film. Most of the
sketches in this film have been
repeated so often in various other
forms of media (books, The To-
night Show, various TV specials)

‘that there is probably little in this
movie that many of us haven’t.

himself from the insincere, faceless

actors, meanwhile, go from simple radio
voices to vivid portrayal of emotional ex-

It is, as the program warns, a play which
is difficult to follow, broken andatthe same ~
time held together by a series of statements
which recur at unexpected moments--”Do
not break the chain.”; “Take care.” These

This conflict between idealism
and self-interest brings home the

inane truisms as ““They’re all thieves, you

know” and “There is a way things are.” The

where else anyway.

Another problem with this
movie, as is the case with many
comedy-concert films, is the struc-
ture of the presentation as it trans-
lates into feature-film form (try
saying that three times fast!) All
of the Cos’ material is presented in
pseudo-anecdotal from, which is
fine, but it gets old. To a live

a theater audience could easily
grow weary of the monotony sur-
facing when he drags out some of
his longer monologues.
However, I speak with a certain
degree of admitted bias. By virtue

before this school year began, I

having seen over 400 (really!)
comedy acts in the last year-and-
a-half, I have come to expect a
great deal from the more estab-
lished and well-reputed stand-
ups. Cosby does, however, ad-
dress his topic material openly
without being too judgmental or
preachy. i

By the same token, he never
aborts his “family| material”
theme for stock material or cur-
rent:events-spawned attempts at

character assassinations. Much of”

his material is drawn from his own
family experiences. In fact, the
family structure on The Cosby
Show mirrors his real family struc-
ture quite overtly. I even believe
that his tensions about raising a
family was deliberately touched
on by the song that plays under the

film’s opening credits, “It Seemed
Like a Good Idea at the Time.”

Cosby never steps over the line
from gentle mockery to insult, and
that ina nutshell might explain his
wide appeal. That in itself, how-
ever, does not a concert film
make. This film has several good
moments, but the viewer must be
willing to wade through a great
deal of old and oft-exposed mate-
rial to hear them.

I don’t wish to:discourage any-
one from seeing this, but anyone
who does go may be wise to sit in
a seat in which occasional fidget-
ing won’t create too much per-
sonal discomfort.
