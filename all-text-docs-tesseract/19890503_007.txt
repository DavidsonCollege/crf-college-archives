displayed even more raucous

virginal Davidson €ars.

Carrington ‘then’ proceeded to
tell the cluster in front of her
exactly how the El Salvadoran
death squad she had hired would
dissect them if they took the
room she wanted. (Bridgers is
now advertising for a new
roommate.)

Housing for next vehbie is so

scarce that many are making

garbage cans as a precaution.
“Tt’ll be a new environmental

experience,” said Hilary Coman,
arising sophomore. “Ilike to be

Blaine John, another rising
sophomore, agreed with Hilary,
revealing that he and Hilary plan
to buy or rent adjoining cans
next year.

Many students returned from the mid-

massive rioting and violence among students.

By CAPTAIN KANGAROO

Donald Trump made good this morning on his pledge to immediately

install condom machines in all Trump University dorms.

The deluxe system installed is activated by slipping a Trump University I.D. card (a
specially modified platinum American Express Card) into a slot on the side of the machine.
A condom is then dispensed and the transaction is recorded in the main Computer Services

Center (CSC) computer.

Working on the new Trump “dollars for data” system, CSC divine being Lydia Lorenzin released a
printout of the heaviest users and locations. The David’ s Onion will print a “Top Five” list of administrators,

faculty and students each week.

Religion professor Trent Foley
topped the list for administrators
and faculty this week. “They
installed oneright outside my door,
and I was just trying to get the hang
of it,” said Foley. “I passed all of
them out in class.”

Puppet President John
Kuykendall also made the list with
17: “I was walking home from the
Commons one night and tripped
and scraped my forehead. Those
were the worst damn bandaids I’ ve
ever used!”

Political science professor
Mary Thornberry hit the charts with
15 condoms this week. “I justdidn’t
want men to sweep all the top
spots!” she said.

The student list was somewhat
skewed. Sources advised us to
ignore John Hutchinson’s

impressive 93 total: “He’s just
showing off,” said Leslie Urban.

“That’s big thinking, though,
said Trump. “I like thinking big. If
you're going to be thinking
anyway, you might as well think
big.”

Likewise, it was revealed that .

John Engel merely walked around

with condoms on his fingers and
toes. “No, really, try it,” he urged.
“It’s areally great feeling, I mean
it!”

Spencer House president M.K.
Myatt said at a press conference
that the house’s card had been
stolen by Hods and that they
weren’t paying for any of them.

SHOCKING David's

plans to gut

“J want the whole placed gutted out.” said Trump, “I see grand possibilities here. I’m not
sure if I want to add a fourth and fifth floor yet or not. I'might feel a little cramped with a

mere three stories.”

of Davidson College,

thrown out of the running. “It was
justtoo small,” commented Trump,
“T like to think big. If you’re going
to be thinking anyway, you might
as well think big.”

Apparently Belk came ina close
second, but, as Trump said, “I liked
the idea of living in a replica of
Thomas Jefferson’s famed
Monticello. I especially enjoy the
fact that it is about three times
bigger than the original. I like to
, think big.”

“T think the balcony off the
third floor professors’ lounge was
the clincher, though,” said Trump.
He likes the idea of standing outon
the balcony and giving speeches
while students, professors and
administrators watch from below,

-“sortoflike the Pope,” said Trump.

“The Pope is big. Real big. I like
thinking big. If you’re going to

“Just thinking about standing
up there while thousands of adoring
fans watch from below gives mea
rush,” said Trump. He says he
absolutely can’t wait to try it out.
“T can’t believe I never thought of
this before,” he said.

Costs of this huge undertaking
are as of yet unavailable. “It'll cost
ahell of a lot,” said Trump, “a hell
of a lot.”

be underway. Love Auditorium
will be converted into a huge
ballroom. “I’m not sure if I’ ever
use it,” said Trump, “but I want it
to look nice. I’m thinking about
lining the walls with oriental rugs
at the moment.”

personal suite. He commented,
“It’s nice and big. I like big.”
Some modifications could
include a removable ceiling for
nighttime star gazing. Trump said

that he wasn’t too much into “this

nature thing,” but he thought it
sounded like a quaint idea. *

One of the most controversial
changes Trump has in mind is the
removal of the Chambermaids.
“They’re just not up to date!” he
said. He plans to replace them with
dollar signs, the word “Trump” or
new maids that would be more
scantily clad.

“Nothing that is gratuitously
pornographic, however,” he
assured The David's Onion. “A

be a bad idea either,” he added.
