What The Davidsonian Is

You'd think we were beating up our
mother or selling the secret formula
for pork and beans to the Red Chin-
ese, judging from the criticism we've
been getting.

But actually all we’re doing is put-
ting out a newspaper, the way we
think it ought to be done.

That’s what THE DAVIDSONIAN is,
you know: a newspaper.

Forget that outdated motto under
the nameplate. Like a lot of other tra-
ditions around here. the name “The
News and Editorial Voice of the Da-
vidson College Student Body” ought
to be changed. It’s a misnomer, and
it’s time a lot of folks around here got
that .straight.

THE DAVIDSONIAN is not a public
relations mouthpiece for the student
government, the Social Council, the
Athletic Department, the CRAP Com-
mittee. or anybody else. If it’s a PR
man you want. try the College News
Bureau. They'll’ fix you, up’ with as
good a “white-wash” as you'll find.

THE DAVIDSONIAN is not a bulle-
tin board either. There are enough of

Editor’s Role '

The function of an editor is to
express an opinion which the
reader can judge. And that func-
tion is properly performed only
if the opinion is an honest one.
The minute an editor withholds
an opinion for fear that someone
may think “irresponsible” or that
he may be “out of step with the
times” he ceases to perform his
function.

Opening Up

The flap over who's to control Lin-
gle Manor now that it’s in disuse
brings to mind a rathér’ serious de-
ficiericy: there is no suitable place for
late night studying here.

The Union Board and Freshman
Council, both politicking for control of
the Manor, have indicated that they’d
like to use it, among other things. for
just such’a purpose. So far, though,
nobody’s won out.

The fact of the matter is, there are
other campus facilities infinitely more
suitable for. the role: namely, the Col-
lege Union.

As the Union itself says, it’s “for
the students.” Why not make it ‘for

those around already. Announcements
belong in the Union’s announcement
sheet, not this newspaper.

What THE DAVIDSONIAN is, is a
newspaper.

That means it prints the news—not
necessarily as the student government
or the Athletic Department or the
faculty would always like to see it
printed, but as the staff thinks is most
fair. appropriate, and appealing.

That means it is a public forum. Its
pages are a wailing wall for anyone
who’s concerned enough to take the
time and the brain strain to write a
letter to the editor.

That means it raises a little hell,
too. For as long as there is a Davidson
College. there will be things wrong

with it. And as long as there are things |

wrong, THE DAVIDSONIAN will com-
plain.

Just don’t get the idea that the
editorial views expressed in this col-.
umn are those of the student body as
a whele. They aren't.

Editorial policy is formulated by a
6-man board of upperclassmen, but in
the final analysis it represents the
opinipn of only one person: the editor.

That one person, in a month’s time,
has had a lot to say about the things
that he personally thinks are wrong
with Davidson College. He has criti-
cized just about everybody in the pro-
cess: students, trustees, faculty.

He will continue to do so, too, no
matter how people take it. THE DA-
VIDSONIAN is, after all, a newspaper.
It has a job — a compelling duty — to
print the news as it sees fit, to be a
wailing wall, to raise hell. .

To do anything less would consti-
tute treason to the principles of good
journalism and a disservice to David-
son College.

The Union

the students” around the clock?

It’s ideal. Students could study
there, type papers there, shoot the
bull there — without disrupting the
peace and quiet back in the dormitor-
ies. Furthermore, there would be
somebody on duty all night to take
any important phone calls that now
go unanswered.

The Union staff has indicated that
‘it’s willing to carry out the change.
Apparently all that’s lacking is a little
of what talks: money.

The change we ask is not much.
It’s just a little something the adminis-
tration ‘could do that would make stu-
dent life here a little more bearable.

The Fund Drive’s Flop

The disappointing outcome of the
Negro scholarship fund drive is as
ironic as it is tragic.

It is ironic because some of the very
students you would expect to support
it haven't.

It is tragic because the Davidson
student body is passing up a chance to
do what nobody else around here has
been willing to do: show a genuine
interest in having more Negro stu-
dents.

To the project’s surprising oppon-
ents and newly found allies of the
rednecks — a number of members of
the so-called activist wing — we say
this:

Sure, there are a lot of things
wrong with both the philosophy and

practicality of the project. It is hypo-
critical, in a way, to go out raising
money for Negro students when just
across the street a double standard
exists. And the idea does sound like
“buying a Negro,” in a way.

But we've got to start somewhere.
It’s abundantly clear that the college
is not going to doit. .

It’s not buying a Negro. Not really.

Admittedly, it will bring only one
Negro student at first. But it could
also prompt a recruiting program, con-
vince foundations to invest here, and
prod the Admissions Office into ac-
tion. If nothing else, it will show that
students really do want Negroes as
well as rednecks in the student body.

What have we got to lose anyway?

Dr. King’s Dream

Dr. Martin Luther King has been
dead a month now. The uproar has
died down. The newspapers and maga-
zines are no longer plastering pictures
of him and his widow on the covers
and front pages. But his cause and
ideas have not been forgotten, nor will
they be any time soon.

The true test of greatness lies not in
the publicity or emotion which sur-
rounded his death, but in the response
of the American public to the chal-
lenge he offered.

Dr. King realized ‘he was riding the

wave of the future, that he would have.

to change the attitude of a “racist
nation,” but he undertook the task
willingly and zealously.

The obvious question now for the
civil rights movement is, where to?
What next? Sadly enough, the initial

response was the same lack of restraint
which cost Dr. King his life. Instead
of uniting blacks and whites in “the
cause,” the looters provoked the

a.

alienation of many who want to help
them.

Before Negroes ever attain the
rights they demand, they must prove
that they are responsible. Just as they
were about to reach this point through
the work of Dr. King and his compa-
triots, a few radicals have begun to
change people’s minds by tearing
apart the cities.

Until ‘the power of the idea begins
to prevail over the power of the gun;
until the sincere majority learns to
control the rowdy minority, Dr. King’s
successors can expect to achieve only
a minimum amount of success.

“] have a dream... ,” said Dr.
King. It is up to all of us—black and
white alike—to see that the same
violence which wrecked our cities last
summer does not recur.

Only if we do this can we begin to
progress again along the road to the
equality and brotherhood of the races.

Martin’s Retirement Signals

Chance To Begin

By DAVID SWEATT
Managing Editor
Davidson College needs a
particular kind of man for
its presidency. It needs a
man of strong academic
background who can bring
creative guidance to the col-
lege as an intellectual com-

munity.

Dr. D. Grier Martin's of-
ficial announcement to the
faculty of his decision to re-
tire from the presidency
seems to call for such a
man. At that time Martin
cited the end of the success.
ful Ford Challenge cam-
paign and the approval of
the Blue Sky curriculum as
a fitting climax to his 10-
year presidency.

But more than just a cli-
max. those things signal the
opportunity for a new begin-
ning.

Speaking thoughtfully of
the future, Martin said:

‘Tam certain that David
son is on the threshold of
probably the frost: iinportant
period in its history. I am
deeviy confident, too that
you will more tian measure
up to the tasks ahéad. They
will involve, a3 yo. Enow,
the blending of all the tradi
tional strength that is Dav.c
son with the creati.e tle.«t-
bility needed to make Da-id-
son's future thé profoundly:
exciting: and inspiring story
it can and must te.”

It is to be hoped that next
year will be more than just
a shakedown cruise for the
new curriculum. When Mar
tin spoke of “creative flexi.
bility’ and a “profoundly ex.
citing’ future, it is unlikely
he meant that the status quo
was his idea of Davidson's
highest». point of achieye-
ment.

Davidson has been, and is:
now, a good college. The
good students continue to
come. though perhaps in
fewer numbers than in years
past.

The: faculty is generally
good, but considerably out
of touch with its profession,
out of touch with the ongoing
developments in its own dis-
ciplines.

In many respects David-
sons rep.tation is built. on
its students. while its teach-
ers fade into professional ob
divion in a Schedule of com.
mittee meetings and com-
munity and church contribu,
tions.

The faculty: basks in its
glory as a collection of great
teachers while its contact
with the acaderhic main-
stream wanes with the years.

If the right man is chosen
for the presidency, he will be-
a man of strong academic
background, a man who pos-

ED NOTE: This is the first
in a series of three articles
solicited from people leaving
Davidson at the end of this
school year. The writer this
week has been an instructor
of English here since 1966.
In June he becomes assistant
professor of English and edi-

versity of Georgia.

By GEORGE CORE

Let me begin by saying I
like Davidson College and
the immediate community a
great deal—and I regret that
financial and professional
considerations make it neces-
sary for me to leave. I am
especially fond of the stu-
dents here, despite my face-
tious remarks ta the con-
trary. and I shall miss my
association with them and
with the faculty.

I want to take this occasion
to comment briefly upon an
issue which will always be
extremely important to the
life of the college. It is per-
haps not quite so important
as issues Hke the increased
and serious encouragement of
faculty professionalism or

the role of the Board of
Trustees at Davidson, but I
will address mysélf to this
subject because of its current
interest. It is of course the
matter of what social rela-
tions are finally going to in-
volve at this school.

Traditionally the student
here has lived in an atmos-
phere of benevolent paternal-
ism which is based upon the
notion that the college acts
in loco parentis for the stu-
dent--and upon the very real
idea of a closeness between
student and teacher. There is
much to be said for this way
of doing things, and I for one
hope that these humane prin-
ciples will persist in a gen-
era] sense.

The college must continue
to take a vital interest in the
lives of its students, in their
behavior both morally and
intellectually. But the tone
and the texture of this rela-
tion has got to change: the
faculty must resist the con-
descension that is implied in
the word paternalism, and
the students for their part’
must resist the impulse to be
irresponsible and childish.,

Again

sesses a tough-mindedness
about his job and the job he
must require of others.

And if we are to be so for-
tunate as to get such a man,
(indeed there are several. on

the list of Presbyterian all...

stars being considered by
the selection committee of
the trustees) he will, by defi-
nition, not be a Davidson
graduate. :

It's not reasonable to ex-
pect the favorite nephew, no
matter how bright he is, to
go back home to tell his un-
cles how to run the family
business. -

For 50 years people have
been thinking that Davidson
was on the verge of really
doing’ something. If there
was ever a.time to live up
to the long-forecast predic-
tion, this: is it.

69 Reed Seniors
To Resist Draft

To The Editor:

Many of the students grad-
uating from college this
spring will be drafted by the
end of the summer. We, com-
prising 66 per cent of the
male seniors of Reed College,
Portland. Oregon, will not
serve in the armed forces of
the United States.

_ Our decision is irrevocable.

Our consciences do not per-

mit us to participate in this
senseless and immoral war.
We are sure that tens of
thousands of students
throughout the country will
join us in resistance.

Honor Bound

The results of THE DAVIDSONIAN’s Honor Code
survey should have come as a surprise to no one except
entering freshmen. Every system has its flaws, and no
doubt Davidson’s honor system is no exception.

But before some observers get overly shocked at
the findings, I think they should consider a few points.

For one thing, just because a substantial portion
of the student body has committed an honor violation,
critics cannot say the system does not work. Every stu-
dent knows that crip sheets and ponies do not flood
classrooms whenever a professor is absent from a re-
view. And there are not many schools where a student
can leave a room unlocked or a textbook unguarded.

An honor system cannot be judged lacking if it is
violated in part. Success need not be absolute. The best
criterion for judging success is whether or not the sys-
tem creates a climate of honor. I think it does here.

1 have an idea that a large number of violations
involve students’ failure to report suspects. The Honor
Code states that failure to report an honor violation is

itself.a breach of the code.

This portion, I feel, is in need of revision. For
one thing, I do not feel that a man is dishonorable if
he fails to report an offense. Society demands loyalty
to friends and condemns the stoolie. This indoctrina- .
tion begins in early life when children are admonished
not to be tattle-tales. Even police informers are con-

demned by the law-abiding.

I don’t think a student is dishonorable if he fails
to report an offense, But the witness is dishonorable if
he condones the violation. I think there are many stu-
dents here who have seen violations committed and
have failed to report them. But at the same time, I
think most of those students did not approve of what

they saw.

___ Perhaps the Honor Court ought to consider rewrit-
ing this provision to make students honor-bound only
to ask violators to turn themselves in. Students would
be duty bound to turn in the offender themselves.

; If anyone thinks this would-weaken the system, I
think he should’ realize that as long as such a difficult
point of honor is on the books, the code is being ser-
jously weakened. by the continued violation of this

requirement.

Sorry you didn’t like the last column, Tom.

Mature Conduct

Each attitude causes and ex-
acerbates the other.

To be more specific, I
would say that in many re-
spects the senior here is more
immature upon graduation
than he was as an entering
freshman. This is true for a
number of reasons, and it
certainly is not a situation
unique to Davidson College.
It springs largely from the
fact that the student here is
treated as an adult mainly in
an intellectual, not in a so-
cial, sense. (Unfortunately
many students are never
pushed academically except
in terms of pure drudgery:
assignments are often purely
mechanical.) On the other
hand, the Davidson student's
social life is a study in para-
doxes: in the college com-
munity he is treated like a
child, and he often reacts
very predictably by being un-
mannerly and by dressing in
a bizarre fashion; outside the
college community he tends
to become a citizen of the
world, and there more often
than not he deports himself

‘responsibly. (This latter gen-

eralization is supported by

the fact that Davidson stu-
dents rarely become involved
in the kind of sordidness and
even absolute corruption that
one finds today in many col-
leges throughout the land.)

One can say with great
justice that the Davidson stu-
dent can take his place as a
responsible citizen in the col-
lege community by conduct-
ing himself in a mature man-
ner; conversely, the faculty
can encourage this maturity
by treating the student as an
adult unless he shows him-
self otherwise. For instance,
the student who dresses and
acts like a gentleman is more
apt to be treated like one
than his shaggy. comatose,
boorish counterpart whose
state may suggest that he is
a bedlamite. If this example
seems trivial, let me say in
all seriousness that it is not
and that civilization depends
in large part upon such nice-
ties. To take an example of
great urgency at present, the
student who drinks at home
and abroad and conducts him-
self as an adult should be
treated accordingly. The stu-

dent who is rowdy and bois-
terous when he drinks. who
consistently drinks too much,
should be anathema to both
his fellows and his teachers:
there is no place for him in
this college or any truly hu-
mane community.

I see the proposed code of
conduct as offering the op-
portunity for a renewed and
honest social life for the stu-
dent here, and I believe the
possibilities of this change
ate appreciably more signifi-
cant than the curriculum re-
visions, important though
they may be. I am hopeful
that the Davidson student will
be accorded his place-as an
adult in the college communi-
ty—and that he will continue
to hold that place through re-
sponsible behavior. (In some .
respects he is getting it to-
day through mere assertion
of good faith,) The privilege
of status must always be
based upon sane conduct:
otherwise all wil] be chaos.
Only under these circum-.
stances can this college or
any other give a full educa-
tion with the idea of develop-
ing the whole man.
