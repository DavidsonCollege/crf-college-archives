Dr. Ben R. Lacy Preaches
At Sunday Night Vesp

Addresses Kadience on the
Subject “The Ministry
As A Vocation”

The feeling of responsibility
by the death of those who died
ignorant of Christ calls many
to the ministry, declared Dr.

Ben R. Lacy, president of the } |
ys 1

Union Theological Seminary
of Richmond, in an address
Sunday evening. |

The subject Dr. Lacy’s talk
was “The Ministry as a Vocation” |

of

and was in line with the addresses
brought here by the
Guidance committee. He gave the
qualifications for choosing the
ministry and listed five motives.
Ministry A Calling

The speaker explained that the

Vocational

ministry is not a profession but a
calfing. has a definite
religious experience and feels a di-
vine call, should not

by his to begin
preparation. Quoting Dr. Herbert
Worth Jackson, in a discussion of

profession, Dr.

a Lacy sug-
gested that prayer will help one in
his choice. But even after this

one must make a definite surrender
to God before accepting a call.

Dr. Lacy then gave five motives
which

are or are not to be con-
sidered. The first, one not to be
considered, is the thought of ma-

terial gain. The second in this class

is the desire to be an exhibitionist.

The thought of prominence and
pleasure must be banished,
Minister’s Life Full

The other three motives include

a desire for fullness of ‘life, feeling

of responsibility, and compassion |

for one’s fellow man. There are |

few restrictions to the life of a

minister; he comes in contact with

all classes and emotions of human
life. His full life finds fruition in

Ri flers Finish
Firing Season

Theiling Leads R.O.T.C. Rifle
Team in Final Match

The R. O. T.'C, rifle team com-
pleted its firing for the year when
it finished the four

Trophy Match on March 15th and
16th.

by all R. O. T. C. units in the coun-
try, including the University ® of
Hawaii. The conditions of the
match call for a five man team,
each man shooting five shots in
each of the four positions: sitting,
kneeling, standing and prone. The
team made an aggregate score of

901 out of a possible 1000. It is be-
lieved that a score as high as this
will place well within the first ten
of the thirty odd teams competing
in the Fourth Corps Area.

Bob Theiling led the team in this
match with a score of 185 out of a
possible 200. But for a bit of bad
luck in the standing position, Theil-
ing might have won the watch of-
fered for the high individual score
in the match, as he made an ex-
cellent score of 50. prone, 50 sitting,
48 kneeling. However in his stand-
ing he let one shot get away for
a miss, and this one shot ruined his
chances of winning the watch, Cap-
tain Springs Pharr was second with
183, W: S. Kunz third with 180, If.
Bolin fourth with 178, and Howard
Woodward completed the fifth man
with 175,

The marked improvement shown

scores made earlier in the season

Ballard and ‘Major Steele, who have

College rifle team was one of the
best in a number of years.

In addition to the above, David-
son fired sixteen correspondence
matches with individual institutions.
While the percentage of wins in
these matches was not as high as
could have been desired, the team
acquitted itself very creditably and
served warning that with another
year of seasoning and experience it
will be hard to beat.

Much credit is due to the fresh- |
