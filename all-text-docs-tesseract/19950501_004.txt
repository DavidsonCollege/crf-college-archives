WALKING AWAY |

Campus Police

By MatrTuew EIrRIcH
Assistant News Editor

After an African-American
visitor was stopped the weekend
before Spring Break, the Vice
President’s Committee for Ethnic
and Minority Concerns began
meeting to evaluate the campus
police’s treatment of African-
American visitors on campus.

The committee serves as an
advisory board to President John
Kuykendall and is chaired by Ex-
ecutive Assistant to the President
and Director of Institutional Re-
search John Kelton. Other mem-
bers of the committee include jun-
ior Latasha Jenkins and Assistant
Dean of Students John Eaves.

As Kelton explains, the com-
mittee privately makes recommen-
dations to the president and the
two communicate by personal cor-
respondence. These personal cor-
respondences are more like letters
than memos, and neither
Kuykendall’s, Kelton’s, nor any
other administator’s office would
give copies of any communica-
tions to The Davidsonian.

Kelton did reveal that recently
his committee sent a letter which
“made recommendations for pro-
cedure” to Kuykendall. In turn,
says Eaves, the president has asked
Dean of Students Tom Shandley,
Director of Auxilary Services Ri-
chard Terry, and Vice President
for Business and Finance Bob
Sutton to review the recommenda-
tions and respond to them.

The committee began work-
ing on the issue of the police stop-
ping African-American visitors,
because “what we heard reported
to the committee was of concern to
us,” says Kelton.

The committee was troubled
because “the frequency with which

African-American visitors are
stopped is much higher,” says
Eaves.

Eaves does not attribute the
difficulties between African-
American visitors and the campus
police to racism but to socializa-
tion. “Weare all negatively condi-
tioned in this society that A frican-
Americans, males especially, are
prone to illegal activity.”

He emphasizes that in the in-
stance of the visitor before Spring
Break and generally “there was no
blant, overt racism” by the offic-
ers.

“The types of things suggested
[by the committee to remedy the
situation] have primarily todo with
education, training, and sensitivity
to these issues and procedures
which will prevent the improper
halting of visitors to our campus,”
says Kelton.

Some kind of racial sensivity
is a priority for Eaves. Speaking of
the police stopping African-Ameri-
can visitors more frequently than
whites, he says, “Because of the
way we are conditioned, we may
do things unconciously.”

Eaves says he has good reason
to be optimistic. Four years ago
the police would sometimes

stopped African-American
Davidson students and ask them
for their IDs. This really is not a
problem anymore, according to
Eaves. “I commend the campus
police for trying to make them-
selves more.accéssible,” he says.

The committee’s recommen-
dations are only tentative and may
still be amended, deleted, or added
to by Shandley, Terry, or Sutton.
The final proposal must be ap-
proved by Kuykendall.

Eaves hopes definite changes
“will be activated by the next aca-
demic year.”

edged sword.”

“There are more commercial
outlets in Cornelius than there was
our freshmen year, as Cornelius
has grown into a small metropo-
lis.” says B.J. Rudell, “Also, there
is a closer male to female ratio,
better weather, anda growing squir-
rel population.”

Several seniors believe that

the students have gotten smarter
but are not as well-rounded.
Tommy Suter thinks that “the stu-
dent body has taken to the books.
We used to have crowds at away
soccer games. People are too con-
cerned about their studies and do
not concern themselves with ex-
tracurricular activities.”

Grady Alsabrook says, “The
people are smarter, but they are
lacking the other essentials, but
hopefully by the time they are se-
niors they will get it together like
our class did.”

“We're really looking for a
superman or a superwoman ... re-
placing Jack is a tall order,” adds
Williams.
