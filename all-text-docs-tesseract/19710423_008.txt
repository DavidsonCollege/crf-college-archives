plagued _ with innumerable
problems in the running
events, often dropping ba-
tons in the relays.

There were no Davidson
places registered in-the track
events. .

Pembroke impféved great-
ly from last year’s relays

an expansion of its track pro-
gram.

and field scholarships.

ern Carolina, 48; 3. Western

This is an advertisement paid for by
E. P. Thornton, Murrells Inlet, S. C.

_Editor’s note: This is the continuation of the ad-
vertisement which Mr, Thornton ran on the last page
of the April 16 issue.

My considered judgment tells me, now, that deing

,invited by persons holding socialist’ viewpoints, and

following a path parallel with that of the Chicago 7
and their bedfellows and podium pals, could not have
worked out well for my “Cause’’. It would be contrary
to human nature.for my erstwhile sponsors to support
me with enthusiasm if, as a result, I might be suc-
cessful even in a small way in adversely influencing
the plan of Rennie Davis, and that of Dr. Patterson’s
group of fifteer advertisers, to “bring America to it’s
knees.”’

__ In such endeavors, unfortunately, many non-
violent people have, like innocents following the Pied
Piper of Hamlin, lent their active support, their mind-
less marches, and their clenched fist communist
salutes. ;

There is considerably more to this episode, but
a skeletal recital seems to me to be in good taste. and
timely in view of the growing arrogance of those who
would join together in gang warfare against our Pre-
sident and his masterful handling of our disengage-
ment from combat in Southeast Asia. My entire file
on this subject will be copied and sent, if anybody is
interested, in the care of some. disinterested third
party, for all-to see.

So, not being a flamboyant criminal out on bond,
not being an advocate of giving up American sover-
cignty in favor of becoming a Socialist Soviet State

in a One World Government. it appears that I shall’

not be able to come before you in person, backed by
sympathetic sponsors. You therefore have been denied
what small contribution I might have made to the
“balanced viewpoint” I was led to believe Davidson
wanted.

May all of you, in America’s hours of trial, depend
on God and not on Madalyn Murray O’Hair. May you
depend on OUR CONSTITUTION and not on some
being cooked up by the Norman Cousins-Rexford
Tugwell axis. May you look for and follow better
leaders than violent anti-American anarchists and
their. star-gazing disciples.

May you have the courage to say: to both your
socialist teachers, and your friends of socialist per-
suasion, “Show me ONE SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT
on the face of the earth that has the personal freedom,
the abundance, and the opportunity that are the es-
sence of AMERICA, NAME, JUST ONE; put up, or
SHUT UP”. |

But if some of you must rush over the precipice
of history, like lemmings, then do so expecting the
suicidal death that comes to lemmings. It will be your
own choice if you prefer the Berlin Wall, the Iron
and Bamboo curtains, and the death of every freedom
that distinguishes YOUR AMERICA from Communism.
Expect the death of the freedom that makes a man a
human being in tune with his creator, rather than a
robot two-legged animal — a creature owned and
‘operated, body and mind, by THE STATE.

I may later discuss some specific issues in THE
DAVIDSONIAN. We will see.
