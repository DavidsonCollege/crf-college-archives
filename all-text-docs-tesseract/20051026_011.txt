Four-game streak snapped at Furman

By BRENT McCormick

As the regular season winds.
down to a close, the ’Cats look
like as if they’re right where they
want to be.

Coming off a 1-0 win against
Furman last Wednesday at
Alumni Stadium, Davidson
walked away. with their fourth
consecutive win in as many
games at home, improving their
home record to 7-1.

Despite losing a close game to
Southern Conference foe Elon on
Saturday, the Davidson squad is
confident they can recover and
insist that their record should
speak for itself.

“A 4-0 win streak toward the
end of the season shows maturi-
ty,” said Preston Davis 06.

“It is unfortunate to ose to
Elon, but these last two [regular
season] games can really help us
make large steps heading into the
conference tournament.”

The win on Wednesday was the
fourth straight for the Wildcats, and as they
improved to a 10-4-1 overall record, their
Southern Conference record stood at an
impressive 3-0, as they were undefeated in
the league.

Matt Allen ’06 scored the game-winning
goal in the 58th minute of play, leading the
Cats to a 1-0 win.

The ’Cats’ unbeaten streak was broken against Elon on Saturday.

Cass Baltz ’07 set up the goal, providing
a cross pass into the box for a waiting Allen.
It was Allen’s third game-winner this season
and the third assist of the year for Baltz.

The Wildcats barely outshot Furman 11-9,
but the seemingly impenetrable Davidson
goalkeeper Ben Ashton ’08 recorded three
saves, and he secured his fourth shutout of

the season.

On Saturday, Davidson
went back on the road to
Elon, to face yet another one
of their SoCon opponents.
Unfortunately for the
Davidson squad, all good
things must come-to an end.
After a tough 1-0 loss to
Elon, the Wildcat’s four-
game win streak was brought
back down to zero.

“The 1-0 loss to Elon is a
bummer, but I thought we
actually played well in the
first half. Things just didn’t
go our way,” said co-captain
David Sartorio ’06. “We look
forward to rebounding
against Appalachian State
with a big win on Senior
Night.”

Elon scored the eventual
game-winner late in the game
when an Elon offender con-
nected with a cross pass to
teammate Gabe Loducca for
the goal.

The loss drops Davidson to
3-1 in the SoCon, while Elon moves to an
undefeated 3-0-1.

The ’Cats will complete their 2005 home
schedule on Wednesday, October 26, taking
on Southern Conference challengers
Appalachian State at Alumni Stadium at 7
p.m. The match will also serve as the team’s
Senior Day.
