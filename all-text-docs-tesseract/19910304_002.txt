California Students’

Tuition Rises 40 Percent

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. (CPS)
- In what was perhaps the biggest
single tuition increase imposed
on any students anywhere, the
University of California’s Board
of Regents voted Feb. 15 to raise
in-state “registration fees” by 40
percent.

| “We are disappointed,” said

Susan Polan of statewide student

ous promise to keep tuition hikes
to maximum 10 percent a year.

In apress release, the regents
said they felt they had no choice
amid drastic cuts in state funding
of the nine-campus UC system.

Besides raising in-state fees
by $650 to $2274 and out-of-stu-
dent fees by $1282 to $9973, the
board also voted to cut 1000 non-
teaching employees from the
campuses’ workforce and to de-
lay the building of a new UC
campus in the San Joaquin Val-
ley.

Brown Expels Student

For Saying “Fighting Words”
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (CPS) -
Brown University officials con-
firmed Feb. 12 they had expelled
a student for drunkenly shouting
insults at black, Jewish andhomo-
sexual students during his birth-
day “celebration” on campus Oct.
18.

The student, identified by a
local paper as football player
Douglas Hann, reportedly ‘had
been disciplined once before for
calling a black student at a party
a “nigger.”

Hann is the first Brown stu-
dent, and perhaps even the first
student in the country, expelled
for violating “fighting words”
policiesadopted by scoresofcam-
puses during the past two yearsas
ways to combat college racism.

Hoping to helpcontrol annual riots
an rowdy behavior by visiting
collegians during spring break
each year, the Palm Springs City
council adopied a series of meas-
ures that make it a crime to wear
string bikinis, to bare breasts or
expose one’s buttocks in public.

Theordinances, in effect, will
give police the power toarrest and
get more rowdy partiers off the
streets.

Mayor Sonny Bonocalled the
new rules “courageous” in lightof
the money that visiting collegians
spend annually.

President Refuses

To Recall “Sexist” Video
MARQUETTE, Mich.

(CPS) - Northern Michigan Uni-
versity President James B. Apple-
berry refused to recall an 8-min-
ute promotional videotape that
some faculty member claimed was
sexist.

A 70-second introduction to
the video featured dancing teen-
aged girls wearing form-fitting
leotards.

While the controversy raised
“basic and contextual gender is-
sues” oncampus, Appleberry told
a Faculty Senate meeting the tape

as “‘very professional.”

He said that, while he would
not recall the tape from any of the
400 Michigan high schools that
already have received it, he would
not send it to any more schools.

Using Time and Sports Illus-
trated magazines, the Davidson
students hope to spark their sev-
enth to ninth grade learners with a
love for learning.

Faye Grasty, agency coordi-
nator and liaison for Davidson
volunteers, said Davidson students
have become powerful role mod-
els for the teenagers they tutor.
“Obviously they have had an in-
fluence on the reading scores,” she
said. “But going a step beyond
that, they’ ve also had an influence
through the relationships they’ ve
formed with the students.”

McGrady said she wanted to help
with this particular project because
it promised one-on-one contact

with an adolescent student. “The”

good thing about this program is
that it gives you a chance to build
agood relationship with astudent,”
Mcgrady said. “Some of them
aren’t involved because they can’t
read well, but because they are at
risk of dropping out because: of
other problems. It helps them to
have a friend to provide encour-
agement and support,” she said.
“There-are a lot of service pro-
grams where your don’t get to know
the person you are helping, but this
program is good because you can
look at your learners at the begin-
ning and at the end and see how
they’ ve progressed.”

ity, a spelling bee was held in the

by senior Melissa Garner, held a
preliminary round on Wednesday
night. The words that the spellers
tackled were given by Professor J.
Gill Holland.

“T'was really surprised to win
it,” related sophomore Bina Desai,
who won the first prize of 50 dol-
lars for her efforts. She won the
competition with the words
“slumgullion” and “traduce”.

Senior Steve Libby, who
tripped up on “slumgullion”, won
the second. prize of 25 dollars.

“Luck played a much more deci-

sive role than skill in the competi-
tion,” said Libby.

lighted with the recognition that
the presidential award brings to
students like McGrady. “Every-

“body is talking about the state of

education,” she said, “What seems

to be working is people from the

outside taking an interest.”
“Learning to read better could

give these ‘students the power to

change their lives,” Duttera said.
“There’s only so much we can ask
the schools todo, and then we have
to be willing to help outourselves.”

Caribbean Writer
Flanagan Reads at Davidson

By Hilary Coman

Caribbean novelist Brenda
Flanagan entertained Davidson
professors and students alike with
readings from her new novel and
older works on the evening of
Wednesday, February 27. Ms.
Flanagan, anative of Trinidad and
currently professor of Caribbean
literature and creative writing at
Eastern Michigan University,
came to Davidson College at the

invitation of Dr. Yoder.
Ms. Flanagan read primarily
from her novel, You Alone Are
Dancing. The novel is set on the

’ fictitious Caribbean island of Santa

Bella, its narrator a native of the
island. The author stressed her in-
sistence on having a novel about
the Caribbean where the protago-
nist does not leave, as is common
in many Caribbean novels.

Ms. Flanagan also read¢some
works of poetry which were pub-
lished in the poetry-journal Cala-
ban.

Both readings were especially

effective, as Ms. Flanagan read
aloud with a varying native accent,
and her impression of calypso
excelled.

On creative writing in general,
she had many insightfulcomments.
She stressed that although the au-
thor begins, the story, the charac-
ters soon are their own: “They tell
you almost what to do.” She con-
fessed that she often does notknow
the outcome of the story.

The future of this “Caribbean
novelist”, as she was advertised on
campus before her reading, ismuch
more diverse than the label would
imply. She informed her audience
of the publication of a book of
short stories, You Alone Are Beat-
ing next year. She also has ideas
for a another book of short stories
which would center on young
women from around the world who
come to the U.S. and become
domestics. This second book is a
departure from Ms. Flanagan’s
usual mode, but she seems to
embrace it enthusiastically.
