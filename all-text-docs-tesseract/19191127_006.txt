‘Phi Society.

The Phi meeting Saturday was
featured by the extemporaneous de-
bate: Resolved, That a special tax
should he placed on all bachelors in
the United States. The affirmative
was represented by J. F. Clark and
the negative by C. W. Robinson.
The hall was kept in constant
laughter throughout the debate by
the wit and sarcasm of the contend-
ing parties.

The regular debate was also
above the average, the subject be-
ing: Resolved, That the United
States should be made mandatory
power over Armenia for the next
twenty years. The affirmative was
upheld by F. V. Long and H. A.
Hill, the negative by T. H. Spence
and A. F. Fricker. The decision was
for the affirmative.

The last part of the meeting was
given over to a hearing of the re-
ports from the retiring officers and
the installation of the new officers
L. G. Calhoun, the new president,
made an inspiring talk in which he
urged the co-operation of all mem-
bers and officers in making the Phi
a better sociéty.

It was voted to bring the Junior
society into the Senior society at
Christmas. This action was taken
upon the recommendation of the
retiring vice-president, who has had
charge of the Junior society. ©

Eu Society.

The regular meeting of the Eu-
menean literary society was held
last Saturday night at 6:45 with a
goodly number of members present.

Before the usual program was be-
gun the newly clected president,
Mr. Sullivan, addressed the society
in a very forceful manner. He an-
nounced his strong desire to begin
an effort for better society work,
faithful to the duties of their or-
ganization and refreshing their
minds as to the real reasons for be-
ing literary society men.

The subject of debate was: Re-
solved, That the United States
should act as a mandatory for Ar-
menia for a period of twenty years.
The debates by both sides were very
good and did not lack touches of
humor. Those debating were: Af-
firmative: Price, J. P.; Boulware,
Doubles; Negative: Bitzer, Walker,
White.

The judges decided in favor of the
negative; but the house voted in
favor of the affirmative.

An excellent oration was deliver-
ed by S. H. Askew.

Goodly Number of Fair Visitors
Expected.

From all appearances this speak-
ing is going to be a humdinger both
in the number of public speeches as
well as those that nature = in-
tended only for the one. The list
of expected fair visitors is far be-
yond any previous event of like na-
ture, but this is only to be expected

when we are all working for a

Lend Us Your Aid—We Will Re-
turn It In the Spring.

Work on the Annual has started in
earnest and it is the purpose of the staff
to send in as much material as possible
before Christmas. The more material
sent in before the holidays the sooner
the Annual will come out in the spring.
While the Annual is gotten out by the
Senior class it is a student body publica-
tion and all members of the student
body are asked to contribute in any way
possible. All who can draw; write
poetry, prose, or jokes; take interesting
pictures; or offer any suggestion and
all who think they can do any of the
above are asked to hand their master-
piece to any member of the Annual staff
or to leave them in number 23 Rumble
any time between 7:30 a. m. and 11:59

OU’'LL smoke a WDC more than an ordinary pipe,

because it’s a sweet, mellow smoke. Follow the old
pipe connoisseurs and have three, four, or more W DC Pipes
on your rack. Smoke a cool one every time. Then you'll
know what a real smoke is. Any good dealer will furnish
you with several select shapes.
