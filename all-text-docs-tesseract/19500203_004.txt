Pretty Adele Castle is ‘featured
with Tony Pastor and his orches-|

tra. The winsone brunette has been|’

‘hailed by tradesters as one of the
finest girl vocalists in the. _ busi-
ness.

One | of the most coveted posi-
tions im; the world of popular mu-
sic, the featured spot with Pastor
was vied for by more than one
hundred applicants. All were test-
‘ed during Tony’s last stay in New
‘York and Miss Castle was selected
after one of the closest audition
series in recent memory.

A New Jerseyite, pretty Adele
has sung with Ray Eberle and his
orchestra. As a featured vocalist,
she has been heard on all major
radio networks and at leading thea-
tres and ballrooms. Before turning
to band work, she had achieved a
great deal of local success at su-
burban supper clubs and theatres
near New York.

A singer ever since her eleventh
birthday, Adele was featured on
local radio outlets as a child and
appeared at all benefits and civic
functions, While singing with
Eberle, she was feted by lier local
townspeople at the famed Meadow-
brook. Since getting her big break
as featured singer with Tony Pas-
tor, she has become the favorite
daughter of North. Jersey and one
of the most popular vocalists in the
land.

Heard on Tony's Columbia Rec-
ords, Adele Castle looks forward to
one-of the brightest futures in mu-
sic as a part of the Pastor team, a
formidable entry in the band sweep-

stakes,

Alumni Celebrate
Decade of Destiny

(Reprinted from the December 2

1049 issue of the Asheville, N.. C.
Cc itizen. )
Ajumni and friends of Davidson

College met here last night in ob-
servanee of what Davidson's Pres-
ident John R. Cunningham fitting-
ly speaks of as “Davidson's De-
cade of Destiny.”

When Davidson’s Centennial was
being celebrated in. 1937, the de-
tails of the present Development
Program were taking shape. At the
Homecoming exercises a few weeks
ago and impressive list of accom-
plishments was presented.

Among things done are the Grey

Memorial Library, the Science
Building. and the tremendous and
admirably equipped Gymnasium.

But the homecoming Davidsonians
were reminded once more that the
expansion program is only well be-
gun. They were also told that,
whatever the reason may be, the

Presbyterians in these latter years
have not devoted to Davidson the
earnest consideration, and the com-
parable material aid which the_col-
lege received between 1837 “and
1900,

Dr. Cunningham and his asso-
ciates who work together the bet-
ter to equip Davidson for its part
in the education of youth in these
troubled days are speaking out very
frankly.: They know that from the
very first days in America the Pres-
byterians were builders of schools
and colleges.

The President and his faculty be-
lieve that the old zeal for educa-
tion and character has not depart-
ed from the sons and daughters of
the Scottish Presbyterians who
came to America seeking and ac-
cepting larger opportunities. Da-
vidson's President and his advisers
are confident that they will have
the necessary support as they plan
for restoring the old section of the
campus as the Woodrow Wilson
Memorial quadrangle, for a center
of fine arts, and for the rest of the
Development program.

sure. they. tried to do their best;
but it is the fault of the system they
used, and that is used by so many
people today. Many articles are
written about other countries that
are based on somé minor observa-
tions within a short time and. not
upon a long. study of
and. groups of the people. They
claim to give a true picture and
are not more than the reflection of
the thoughts of a small group of
people that are in no way typical
for the rest. But these articles can
do more damage than can
make good again. They can destroy
more understanding and good will
between two nations that have mis-
understood each other for a long
and are now trying to create

It would be the same thing if I
would come to America, go around
and talk to all the members of the
communist party in this country,
then go back and write about
America. being a communistic na-
tion. Everybody could see, that this
system would be entirely wrong,
you may even say, dangerous.

I am writing this, not in order
to attack the two reporters of the
American Legion Magazine. I am
far from doing this. | am writing
this, because I want to try to point
out, how important it is that one
tries to acquire a right and true
picture by long and serious study
of the people, their institutions, and
their way of life, before one starts
to write about the country and
forms an opinion that might be-

his mates a 48-38 lead to coast. on.
Tt was: here Davidson broke out of
the Slaughter-styled zone into a
man-for-man defense only to drop
further behind 58-43 on South Car-
olina fast breaks. A crip by South
Carolina's Don Cox and 4 success-
ful Gamecock free throws inereas-
ed the margin, 64-43, with only a
very few minutes remaining. Cobb's
one hand push and Coleman's foul
shot ended Davidson's scoring as
Cox hit one more set shot to close

the scoring for the game, 66-46.

Davidson's zone seemed to work
fairly well on keeping Slaughter
down, although the Gamecock
center hit for 18 points. Don Cox
of Seuth Carolina was high pomt
man for the night with 20 points,
as Hengeveld led Davidson with 11
points. South Carolina converted
12 of 22 free throws and compared
to Davidson's 20 out of 30,

peace. And we must try to ayoid

reaching this aim.
