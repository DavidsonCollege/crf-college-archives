THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE FIVE

Ski Lights

BY ALEX BERNHARDT

'

If you have noticed an exceptional number of
crutches around the campus since semester break, vou
may not understand why the current rage is Skiing. None-
theless, Playboy, Sports Illustrated, Life, and even Time
run articles and innumerable advertisements on ski re-
sorts, ski clothes and skis. The recent Winter Olympics in
Innsbrook helped to put skiing even more in vogue. |
Winter sports, like Ivy clothes and folk music, have made |
their belated way to our locale from the big Eastern |
schools, and a temperate climate is no longer a good|

excuse for the Davidson student not to know a few |
stylish ski terms to drop.

}

_ In all defense to a great sport, however, skiing is as
exciting and clorful as any other outdoor activity I know,
and a good skier must have nerve as well as skill. The|
Davidson student now has access to several acceptable|
slopes, but to avoid crutches and empty wallets there are |
several things the aspiring skier should consider.

The most common reasons for accidents are poor
snow conditions and general ignorance about skiing equip-
ment and principles. In this area snow will often melt!
during the dav and freeze at night into a solid sheet of|
dark, ominous ice; in such a case you had better look at}
the girls and come home. If you are a beginner and are
renting equipment, be sure your skis are no taller than
vou are and that your boots fit very snugly, since good
boots are more essential than good skis. Most skis have
safety release bindings to protect your knees and legs,
but their purpose is defeated if they are tightened too
much. None of these pointers will be of much help,
however, if you insist on going to the top of the biggest
slope before knowing how to stop or turn. A little practice
and experimenting will help you master these fundamen-
tals, but the best and cheapest way is to eavesdrop on the
pro when he is teaching his classes.

The best way to learn to ski in a hurry is to go where
the facilities are the best, and in a surprising number of
cases these resorts will have the cheapest prices. I was

lucky enough to go with Dr. Clark to Stowe, Vermont, for |’
four days during the Christmas holidays, and we found |}{

the lift fees comparable to those in this area, and the

rentals were a little cheaper. Stowe has 28 slopes that:

are all longer than any run in the South, and the novice
slopes there would put some downhome “experts” to)

shame. One can certainly get in more skiing there in al!
day than in any two days in North Carolina, and conse-|*

quently one learns twice as quickly.

If you are not interested in driving a thousand miles,
however, the Blowing Rock Ski Lodge is only two hours|

from Davidson. Blowing Rock has a beginners’ and an *

intermediate slope and a 2500 foot main slope, the longest

in North Carolina. Rental fees for skis, boots, and poles My

is about $6.50, and the lift fee is $4.15 on weekdays and |
an additional dollar for the weekend; this $11.50 weekend |
rate is the highest I have encountered anywhere, and the
lifts only run from 10:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. If you want
to try to ski through a mass of sprawling plumbers, go to
Blowing Rock, but do not expect the snow to be always

good. When I was there last weekend, I saw six broken}

legs in two hours, and the victims had to wait in line for
splints and stretchers. Nevertheless, Blowing Rock is still
the most logical place to ski if you only want to go up
for the day.

My nomination for the best ski resort in this general|
area is the Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia. It is a
five hour ride to the Homestead, but the additional three

hours are well spent; this resort has far more class, better}

skiing and cheaper prices than any other place in the
South. The student rates are $4.50 for rentals, and the

lift fee is $2.00 on weekdays and $6.00 on weekends. The},

Homestead has a 3500 foot main slope, two intermediate
rope tows, and three back trails for skiing in natural
snow. Music on the slopes, a circular fireplace in the
lodge, and adequate ~~ attention also add to the
appeal, not to mention t the Homestead is centered
between Hollins, Sweetbriar, and Mary Baldwin. Consid-
ering the prices and the crowd, the ideal time to ski is any
weekday you can afford to take the cuts; you can possibly
afford more for your purpose if you have either Profes-
sors Clark or Wruck.

It would be impossible to describe every aspect of
skiing in detail since this sport involves not only a wide
range of technical aspects but also a gratifying amount of
color. This is one fad that is neither temporary nor unex-
plainable, for skiing has long been acknowledged as the
most enjoyable of winter sports by its devotees. Perhaps,
if the Davidson gentleman continues to show an interest,
the fad will become permanent here also, and ski sweaters

may come to Rush’s yet.

Indoor Track Season
Draws Near The End

The abbreviated winter track season arrived at Dav-
idson this month, despite the lack of an indoor track and
the miserable abundance of undesirable weather. In the
last two weeks, the Davidson Indoor Track team has turn-
ed in commendable showings in the Big Five and Southern
Conference Meets.

In the Big Five compe-
tition, held at UNC on Feb. 15,
the ‘Cats finished fourth—ahead
of hapless N.C. State. Alan Tur
ner took first in the 70 yard low
hurdles with a time of 7.9 sec
onds; his 6.5 second finish in
the 60 yard dash was good for
third place.

“These little
publicity and work under some

boys receive
terrible hardships,"’ said Whittle.
“I think they should receive rec
ognition for their hard work.”

Ronnie Reese got fourth in the
880 with a 2:02; Tommy Heff-
ner claimed fifth in the mile.
The real excitement came from
Steve Gill's finish in the quarter.
Running against four Blue Devils
and one Carolina athlete, Gill
moved from fifth to third in the
last 220, passing two Duke run-
ners in the process.

The Southern Conference Meet
saw the ‘Cats beat out Rich-
mond for seventh place. Only
Alan Turner produced points for
Coach Heath Whittle’s squad.
Turner took second in the 60 with
a 6.4 and cleared the six-hurdle,
70-yard course in a winning time
of 8.1.

Other members of the squad
include Greg Gates, John Bar-
row and Denny Phillips. The
latter combines with Gill, Reese
and. Turner to form the mile
relay team. In the Big Five
Meet, freshmen Jerry Kriebel|
and Steve Humphry accompan-

ied the squad.
