ATC Cuts Proposed Budgets, Lacks Funds

By TED WILSON

The Activities Tax Council
yesterday proposed next year’s
budget for student-run organiza-
tions. However, no final budget-
ary decisions will be made until
Tuesday.

“Just because we did better
than last year doesn’t mean we did
well,” said Peggy Pierotti, next

year’s editor of Quips and
Cranks. Pierotti said the ATC pro-
posed to give the yearbook

$26,000, which is $1,600 shy of
her recommendation.

She said “we need about
$1,000 more to produce a book of
Davidson quality as far as I can
tell now,” but she added “I
haven't decided what I’m going to
do” about obtaining the rest of the
money.

Pierotti said that, though the
ATC’s proposed allotment for
isn’t enough, “I realize that they
don’t have enough money” to
accomodate all the other organiza-
tions’ requests since the Student
Activity Fee has not been raised.

Pierotti said she plans “‘to have
paid positions on the yearbook

staff,” in contrast to-this-year. The _.

total staff salaries account for less
than $1,000 annually, and are less
than the salaries paid to the David-
sonian editors and the SGA Chan-
cellor, she said.

“The reason they cut them
[paid positions] out last year was
because they [the editors] made a
$2,000 addition mistake and they
got less than they asked for and
needed,” she said, adding salaries
were henceforth cut from the
budget.

Pierotti said while next year’s

book will be reduced in size and
will have an inexpensive cover,
the staff will not reduce the
number of color photos.

John Gathings, editor of The
Davidsonian, said the ATC pro-
posed to give the newspaper
$13,500, which is $1,300 short of
his reccomendation. He said the
proposed budget is “operable but
we won’t get a new addition to our
typesetting equipment which we
could really use.” He added, “I
was afraid of getting less than we
did, so generally, I’m satisfied.”

Martha Wilson, co-editor of
next year’s Hobart Park said,
“I’m pretty happy” about the
ATC’s proposal to allot $2,845 to
the publication. Wilson recom-
mended $2,900, adding: “it was a
really tight budget. We were care-
ful to keep it as low as possible.”

She said the main reason the
ATC came so close to meeting
Hobart Park’s proposal is the in-
crease in student support for the
publication. “There have been
more submissions and more
copies picked up,” she said.

Wilson said money will ‘be
savéd by “holding down Xerox
costs.” The editors will make
fewer copies of the submitted ma-
terial for their staff members to
read and evaluate. She said they
can also save by selectively
choosing the most competitive
production price.

Though the production fell
$55 short of its goal, Wilson said,
“we're not going to contest it.”
She said, “I don’t want to take $55
from another organization when
we could absorb the cost.”

Dana Lemon, co-editor of The

Wildcat Handbook also said she
would not contest the ATC’s
budget proposal. She said the pub-
lication plans to get $1,000 of the
$1,050 the editors asked for.

“We are pleased and we will
be able to run it with the [pro-
posed] budget” she said. “We ex-
pected to get the whole amount
but $50 isn’t that much,” she
added.

Lemon said the staff hopes to

obtain the rest of the needed
money from advertisement sales.
She emphasized there will be “no
cutbacks” from last year’s budget.

Lemon also said she was
“pleased about the Black Student
Coalition’s proposed alottment.
The organization plans to receive
$3,900 from the ATC. Though the
BSC requested $5,000, “we will
not be funding the Martin Luther
King Lecture Series next year

which is where the majority of our
funds were distributed,” she said.
The President's office will pay for
the events next year.

Lemon said the BSC “will
have no problems operating on the
$3,900 from the ATC.”

Other student leaders could
not be reached or had not yet been
informed of the ATC’s budget
proposal, which the SGA will
vote on at Tuesday's meeting.

The Davidson College Peace Coalition held a Die-In on Monday to
protest aggression in Central America. The statement, which lasted
only a short while, occured on Chamber's lawn,

TUF Tries To Retain Yearly Continuity

By DAVID VAN PELT

A year after the dissolution of
the Davidson Christian Fellow-
ship, its successor The Unknown
Fellowship (TUF) is struggling to
establish its identity and reach out
to the campus community, ac-
cording to program coordinators.

According to sophomore John
David Ramsey, one of six new co-
ordinators recently chosen for
next year, The Unknown Fellow-
ship has had to battle the stigma of
cliquishness, close-mindedness,
and alienation from campus life
which plagued DCF last year.

“The reputation we had wasn’t
purely fictitious,” Ramsey said.
According to junior coordinator
Ted Wolfe, “in the past The Fel-
lowhip has closed off a lot of
Christians.” The group, he said,
“had a certain way of doing
things” which alienated many stu-
dents. He said it was easy for Fel-
lowship members to associate
among themselves and appear
cliquish without knowing it. “The

Fellowship is only as good as the
people individually,” he added.

The primary focus of Fel-
lowhip activity this year, accord-
ing to coordinators, has been to
define its purpose and establish it-
self as a viable campus organiza-
tion.

One of DCF’s biggest prob-
lems had been a lack of continuity
from year to year. According to
senior Hank Van Deventer, each
year organizers have had to rede-
fine the scope and philosophy of
the Fellowship. TUF has underta-
ken several measures to combat
the inconsistency of DCF.

Van Deventer said TUF last
week finalized its affiliation with
Inter-Varsity, a national organiza-
tion of Christian fellowships. The
organization will advise TUF on
campus activities, sponsor confer-

ences and mission training pro-—

grams, and provide a staff worker
to operate on campus. The affilia-
tion with a national organization
will “hold consistency year in and

year out,”” Van Deventer said. All
students somehow involved in the
Fellowhip were asked to vote on
the affiliation, he said, which
passed overwhelmingly.

Another important aspect of
TUF’s reorganization involves the
formulation of a Statement of Pur-
pose, which Van Deventer said
expresses TUF'’s desire for “con-
crete goals.” The Statement of
Purpose, he said, originated from
a retreat in January which dealt
with what the purpose of TUF
should be. According to the State-
ment, “our purpose, through both
our words and actions, is to share
and encourage growth in Jesus
Christ as the Bible reveals Him
and as we experience Him in our
lives.”

Three subheadings are in-
cluded in the Statement of Pur-
pose. TUF wishes to encourage
missions through relevent
academic courses, small groups
devoted to the subject, and semi-
nars. Evangelism is another cen-

tral focus of TUF, according to the
Statement, which it hopes to
develop by emphasizing com-
munication — skills, workshops,
and Bible studies. Discipleship
and growth is the third TUF goal.
TUF encourages “personal and
systematic prayer,” knowledge of
the Bible, and involvement with
missions and evangelism to
achieve this end.

The TUF coordinators for this
year have also conducted a train-
ing program for next year’s coor-
dinators to ease the transition to
next year's leadership. This Sun-
day will make the final training
session before the coordinators for
next year take over, according to
Van Deventer.

Junior Stewert Cooper cited a
lack of communication between
large and small groups as harming
the effectiveness of the Fellow-
ship in the past. “We really want
to build a sense of common
unity,” he said. According to co-
ordinators, now that the Fellow-

ship has more clearly defined its
role, it can stress involvement
with the campus and commmun-
ity. It sponsored several activities
this year including a winterizing
project.

Ramsey said, “the outreach of
the Fellowship has not been that
strong this year.” The Fellowship
hopes by sponsoring activities
such as a Bugs Bunny-Charlie
Chaplain film festival Saturday
night, a square dance on May 2.
and a picnic at the Lake Campus
on May 10, it can appeal to a
broad base of students.

According to Ramsey, TUF
can accomplish none of its goals
without an open-minded attitude
on the part of the students. ‘The
campus is going to have to meet us
half-way,” he said. “I think it's
important for the campus as a
whole to realize that we're trying
to change what was wrong with
the Fellowship in the past.
