colleges and 99 all-men col-
Jeges; in the spring of 1968,
‘the figures had dropped to
97 women’s colleges and only
68 men’s colleges.

At present, to the know-
ledge of the Commission
around 20 per cent of the
remaining single-sex colleges
are considering becoming
coeducational. As the alter-
native to coeducation, the
single-sex college seems an-
achronistic.

The thinking of the Com-
mission about Davidson and
coeducation has been modi-
fied by financial and politi-
cal considerations, as well
as by social and education
al concerns and commit-
ments. . The Commission,
believes that Davidson can
become coeducational with-
out jeopardizing its healthy
financial situation, if, yin the
process of implementation
sufficient and capable plan-
ning accompanies the
change. Its reasons for think-
ing as if does are the suc-
cess of other colleges in
making the change, and the
relatively advantageous fin-
ancial position everyone
seems to agree that David-
son occupies at this time.

In regard to what the Cok

of, it may be-useful to paint
out here that the Commis-
sion’s not recommending a
coordinate ‘coilege is relat-

seems to be the extra cost

ty to recommend, the Com-
mission would have recom-
mended it. Men and women
sharing one campus, one set
of buildings, seems better
to suit the social and edu-
cational needs of ,our, time.

As for political considera-
tions, the Commission is
aware that much prepara
tion will have to be made
for the introduction of wo-
men to the Davidson cam.
pus.

Two reasons seem to rank
highest: one,. if coeducation
at Davidson is to become
real in fact and not merely
in name, a great deal of
planning, building, modify
ing and the like has to take
place not only in the physi-
cal plant and in the adminis-
trative offices, but also in
the minds of those affected

directly and indirectly by
the change.

The New, and Limited, Role.

of Social Fratecnities
With respect to social fra-
ternities there are wide dif-

- ferences of opinion and con-

viction among the members
of the commission. The ma-
jority of the Commission feels

. that institutionalized ex-
clusiveness of social organi-
zations has no place on the
Davidson campus.

The majority of the Com-
mission therefore believes
that every student at David-
son College should have equal
option for the kind of social

+ life he desires whether it be

in the residence hall,| the
College Union, or in a social
fraternity. -

In the light of the fore-
we recommend that
fraternities be allowed to
pledge and initiate students
from the three upper classes,
that the houses now furinsh- ,
ed to the fraternities be put
to other use, that the mem-
bers of the fraternities be
provided the same _ social
facilities as -are~ provided
for all students, that all resi-
dent students, whether mem-
hers of a fraternity or not,
pay the social fees for their
respective residential units,
and that no additional social
organizations with selective
membership be chartered by
the college or Student Gov-
ernment Association.

We further recommend
that the social fees be pro-
tected from diversions to any
other uses.

Campus-Wide Social
Activities

The natural center for
campus wide activities is the
College Union. ,

We recommend that a new
College Union facility be
constructed around the fol-
lowing provisions:

(1). To promote the func-
tion as the center of the
campus ommunity, there
should be 'a post office and
switchboard.

(2) There should be a
quality restaurant and
snackbar facilities.

(3) There should be office
space for student-run and
non-academic, student-orien-
ted, offices such as the
Union Board, the Union Di-
rector, SGA, RHA, DAVID-
SONIAN, Chaplain.

(4) Facilities which cannot
be provided for students in
residence halls should be pro-

4

room, game room, and
arts and crafts center,

(5) A guest house of good
quality should be included.

We also recommend that
efforts be made to insure that
the union program is directed
to meet the needs of all
the members of the campus
community, and that it also
make the best possible use
of the resources (in person-
nel and physical facilities)
available to it in that com-
munity.

MINORITY REPORT
Dissenting from Anti-Frater-
nity Section
The majority of the Social
Patterns. Commission has
concluded that fraternities
are anathema at Davidson
and must be exorcized. Jud-
ging from the recent past,
it is predictable that their
conclusions will be shared
(in advance) by the majority
of the Davidson faculty and
the minority —of- Davidson

students,

Perhaps this is the year
in which the steady anti-
fraternity pressure of the
past dozen ‘years will finally
claim its victim. The grounds
have been carefully prepar-
ed by the Commission and ‘its
predecessors, some of whom
are duly immortalized with
selected quotations in the
Report of the Majority.

lt has been most pleasant
fo dissent from the view of
the majority, because of
their personal graciousness
and patient tolerance of this
badly outclassed adversary
and it was determined
from the start that mv preju-
dices \deviated from the con-
sensus prejudice.

‘The obligation of somehow
expressing a minority view
is probably a_ futile one,
since in matters of opinion
one must either be a ma-
jority. or an authoritv. Being
neither, I feel further en-
cumbered by the thinly viel-
ed attitude’ of some Commis-
sion members and witnesses
that any defense of David-
son’s fraternity system must
be immoral. insensitive and
inhumane (and “‘evil’’).

I suggest that this defense
is probably futile, further-
more, because I recognize
that this Commission has

an

seized upon a tactical de-'

vice that escaped the designs
of earlier committees, Rather
than a frontal assault on the

, emascuiation

Constitutional (in the sense
of both-the U. S. Constitution
and the internal Ffaternity
Codes) membership practices
of the fraternities, this Com-
mission has concentrated its
recommendations toward
of the frater-
nity organizations.

In effect the
recommending: Let them
choose members any legal
way they prefer, but don't
let them perform any of the
organizational functions of
serving their members.

Fraternities, alone among
the organizations and pro-
grams of Davidson College
are to be relegated to 19th
Century status—if that! This
Is simply an indirect plan
for abolition. -

The Commission de¢rees
“stately pleasure dorms,”
whose magnificent programs
are somehow to bring a Uto-
pia of social activity for all
and acceptance for the under-
privileged. If the present stu-
dents thought they would fare
better with meais, parties,
teams limited to some ar-
bitrarily social-engineered
collection of fellow dorm-
tenants, they would surely
have taken bettér advantage
of their free opportunities
to do so.

That some few have chosen
not to join fraternities or to
deactivate their membership,
does. not per se prove that
these few are more percep-
tive than the others (insen-
sitive clods?) who thrive on
fraternity activities. It mere-
ly proves that there is no
serious barrier to a student
who chooses to bypass fra-
ternities.

I am unable to believé that
future generations of students
are going to develop any
significant degree of loyalty
to their random-assignment
Superdorms. The Commis-
sion’s prophecy that future
administrators will somehow
exploit such dorm-loyalty to-
ward the Purpose and Goals
of the College is rfore a
day-dream than a vision.

There is, of course, the
Possibility that the composi-
tion of future student bodies
will be altered markedly as
the fame spreads of this new
welfare state for the intelli-
gentsia.

Unfettered from the alle-
gedly inhibiting comfcrmity
of what a former administra-
tor, in a famous parlor-style
demonstration of -group psy-
choanalysis, diagnosed for the
Davidson, faculty as ‘‘the
Fraternity Mentality,” will
our future students somehow
not object to the New Con-
formity? ,

service to ‘‘greater self-de-

sion is proposing that in the

It is imagined that if we

can just de-emphasize fra-
ternities -into obscurity, then
those students who have  so-

cial inadequacies will be
protected from the brutality
of exclusionism long enough
to evolve socially.

It just might work if all
the other students will just
suppress their evil desires
to choose their own friends.
They must accept their as-
signed friends secure in the
knowledge that whom the
admissions committee
selected (small ‘‘s’’ — of
course), and the dormitory
assignment plan has group-
ed, must be the’ best of all
possible worlds for broaden-
ing, one’s horizon through
stimulation, diversified inter-
personal relationships, etc.,
etc. i

Early in the Commission's
deliberations T had support-
ed the concept of providing
more attractive options for
Davidson students, whereby
fraternities would have been
healthily and partially de-
emphasized by the advent of
Subsidized exciting alterna-
tives. Apparently this won't
do.

The Commission has judged
that-its proposal will be bet-

ter and more exciting than”

the present system and free
of Evil. It has judged, how-
ever, that the majority of
Davidson students won't ac-
cept the virtues of these pro-
posals if they are
alternatives, competing with
a fraternity option. (Where
did the admissions committee
go wrong?)

Therefore, the Commission
has concluded that the New
Age must be ushered in by
techniques of Prohibition and
Benevolent Paternalisrn.

The Commission majority
urges that if fraternity mem-
bership be not open to ALL
(which, | would suggest, is
an internally contradictory
concept), then must b<
open to NONE in any mean-
ingful way.

This latter resolution is ))

In reading through the re-

the Commission that those

alumni who wish to change
nothing are looking towards
the past, while those who
wish to change Davidson to
a coeducational college are
more conscious of the de-

apparently, of the future. As
one alumnus (in favor of
coeducation) wrote, ‘The

has put that eventually to-
gether with other social con-
cerns, and attempted to ar-
rive at recommendations de-
signed to anticipate oppor-
tunities which may be Creat-
ed, as well as _ problems
which may occur. Recom-
mendations 2, 3 and 4 reflect
a part of that thinking. The
healthiest ratio of men to
women, in the experience of
most of the colleges known
to the Commission, is three
men to two women. Because
women tend to be _ better
qualified for admission to

ed, will require active re-

The modification of the
present physicial plant
should be done, the Commis-
sion believes, with aware-

ness that it is perfectly pos-
sible for coeducation to exist
in name only, at Davidson

as it doés in some other
campus.
Informal contact in the

halls and in classrooms and
on the walks must.be sup-
plemented by informal con-
tact in a variety of situations
and places, made possible by
skilfull planning and _ build-
ing. At Davidson, for ex-

-ample,

the eating - situation
is one which needs to be
changed how, and will de-
mand to be changed before
coeducation can exist in
fact.

The Commission has some

‘reason to think that coedu-

cation does change,
ually for the better,
ards of dress, manners, and
the like on college cam
puses. Likewise, considering
Davidson's rural location,
coeducation seems desirable.

Commission is aware
that academically tal-

especially in a relatively
isolated situation, such as
that of the Davidson cam

sively, and to be difficult to

pens, the time comes for

As for the !seXual conduct
of students on a coeduca-
tional campus, the Com-
mission is aware that pro-
bably it will be worse than
useless to attempt to apply
old standards to control
sexual behavior, In all like-

lihood the students will en.

gage in a long war of attri-
tion, to the detriment of
everyone, as they press for
freedoms in line with con-
fYemporary morality. Per-
haps there is a paradox
here, that while the social
lives of the students are the
College’s responsibility to
foster, the sexual lives of the
students are their own re-
sponsibility. The experience
of other ocollegés suggests
that with increased freedom,
such as that provided by
open or coed dormitories,
students tend to need in-
creased counseling and other
help, and the college is ex-
pected to provide the help
needed, :

As for educational concerns
and. commitments, the Com-
mission is eager to ‘repeat
its belief that Davidson
should not become coeduca-
dional unless it can do sé
without jeopardizing those
programs now. in operation
and other programs (such as
those which form a part of

the Blue Sky Curriculum)
planned for the near future.
It would be remiss, jow

if it did not state here
also that the success of pre-
sent and planned programs
may be related to the im-
plementation of coeducation.
Those programs depend in
large part on highly quali-
fied and highly motivated
students; and it is these stu-
dents, the men especially,
perhaps, who seem to be
choosing the public, coedu
@ational institutions, and not
the private, single-sex  col-
leges.

One of the ways to secure
a highly qualified student
body is to become coeduca
tional; women may enhance
even the present high quali-
ty of students at Davidson.

The Commission believes
that coeducation will in-
crease Davidson's flexibility
in a number of areas. In ad-
missions it is common know-
ledge that the coeducational
institution has an edge on
its single-sex competitors be-
cause of its ability to at-
tract the students it wants.

Briefly, it seems that co-
educational colleges have a
Jarger number of qualified
applicants to work with. An
all) men’s college becoming
coeducational is also in an
exceptionally favorable pos-
ition these days; many well-
qualified women wish to at-
tend a prev iously all men’s
college.

In terms of the programs
a liberal arts college offers,
it appears that the presence
of women on the campus
may result in better use of
these programs. Men = and
women specialize, but not
in equal numbers, in the
same things. This statement
applies to the sciences and
to the humanities although
sometimes it is heard that
women endanger the situa-
tion in the sciences; they do,
if-they are present in such
large numbers that there are
not sufficient men enrolled
to give the sciences the po-
pulation they meed. Women
