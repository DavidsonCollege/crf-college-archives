S. H. Askew brought out in an ora-
tion “The Rights of the Southern Cot-
ton Farmer.” He defended their rights
vigorously and denounced the piracy in
the action of the Western wheat tarmer.

Under head of general business, the
society decided to make certain improve-

Cumberland branch withdrew, adapting
its government to its needs, ‘The next
break was between the present Northern
and Southern churches, due to canditions
arising in the Civil War. In t906 the
Cumberland united with the Norther
church.

After the introductory outline of the
histery of the church Roberts proceeded
to show that the only two remaining di-
visions of the . Presbyterian church ip
America should unite. His main  rea-
sons for this were: (1) ‘The old dif-
ferences arising from the Civil War
which have been set aside; (2) these
two branches are assentially one and the
same; (3) in union there ts strength:
(4) it is necessary for Presbyterians te
unite among themselves before they can
influence others to unite with them te
form the World church.

Following this Calhoun made a few
remarks carrying out the above thots.
He closed with a. striking appeal by
showing that it is the duty of — evers
Chistian to make good the principles of
Christian fraternity for which many
gave their all in the great world war.

Phi, Society.

Demonstrating their love fur the old
college, the Phi Society made an attempt
to aid the faculty in the solution of im-
portant and timely questions at— their
necting Saturday night. — Resolved,
“That a diploma from the literary so-
cieties should count as a credit towards
graduation from Davidson,” was the
query for debate. Poole, Foster and
Howell contended that this new custom
should be inaugurated, while Neal,
Holmes and Joe Story protested against
any such innovation. “The debate was
good—not peor, not excellent. The
judges saw fit to cast all three of their
votes for the affirmative.

T. R. Alexander gave a demonstra-
tion of his ability to assimilate Senior
English: in the form of an oration on
Edgar Allan Poe and the platform be-
fore the president's chair. His knowl-
edge of dates concerning this poet was
refreshing.

J. M. Dunlap and Spence next engaged
in a bush-pulling contest over: Resolv-
ed, That the study of German should be
abolished from American schouls and
colleges. The affirmative, debated by
Mr. Dunlap, lost by a three to nothing
vote. The critic wearied the audience
with a disclosure of his ideas of speak-
ing. After a discussion of attendance
on the Fresh-Soph debate, which was to
be held Monday night, the suciety dis-
banded.

PIANO TUNING

You notice those who play
a Violin, Guitar or other
string instrument always
tighten the strings and get
them in tune every time
they begin to play. For
similar reasons pianos need
regular tuning — though
not so often. Oncea year
is generally advised. The
spring is the best season for
this work — because the
weather conditions are
more uniform and favora-
ble.

_ With a full’ audience and an interest-
ing set of speakers on the program, the
Eumencean Society enjoyed one of its best
spring meetings. The house was full of
“pep” and those coming off delivered
snappy talks.

The subject for debate was: Resolv-
ed, ‘That a diploma from the literary
societies should count as a credit towards
graduation from Davidson, The affirm-
ative was defended by Gunn, Doggett
and Manning. ‘Their strong argument
was, that a man accomplishes as much
work and gets as much mental training
in, four years of society work as he does
in one year of any other. The negative
was upheld by Heizer, Sanders and Lis-
ton. Their main points were, that the
standard of a Davidson degree would be
lowered, and that a poor class of stu-
dents would be induced to Davidson by

the offer. The committee decided in/the one you think is the best
favor of the negative. The house did judge either at the Gym the
