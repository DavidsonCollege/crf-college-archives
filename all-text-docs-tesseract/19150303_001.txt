DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON. N. C., MARCH 3, 1915.
‘Charlotte Y. M. C. A.

Plays Here Saturday

With “Grcen Machine.”

In what promises to be one ot th
fastest and hardest tought games ot bas
ket ball ever played -in the State. the
Davidsin quintette will hook up next
Saturday with the “Cireen Machine.”
representing the VY. ME C. AL of Chat
otte. “his game, which will be played
at high noon, 12 o'clock, is the third ot
a series between these two teams, cach
having a victors to its credit. “The de
ciding battle will be bitterly fought toi
the last blow of the whistle.

Ir is hard to foretell the outcome ot
the game. bur the Davidson five will
have the edge on their opponents as the
game will be plaved on their home floor.
The Charlotte team, however, has one
af the strongest basket ball teams iw the

State, having defeated ‘Trinity, AL &
M., Union Seminary. Salisbury and
Statesville. Captain Stewart, af this

team, is considered one of the best tor
wards in’ North Carolina. Elis goal
shooting has won many games for Char
lotte.

The Davidson team has been under
going strenuous practice for this gare,
and when the whistle blows next Satur
da yit will be in the ping of condition.
The student body and visitors will have
the opportunity to see the Red) and
Black team in the best of form on the
local floor, Captain Somerville’s goal
shooting, Al Reese's floor work, and the
long boy, “Dutch” Hengeveld’s jump a
center, ase Worth seeing any day.

‘The success of basket ball next: vear
depends on the interest which the game
receives this veat. and it is hoped that a
hearty support will be given this last
game of this season.

TRACK MEFTS PLANNED.

Davidson has many good track men
on the Hill this vear. and it is sincerel:
hoped that some good meets can be ar
ranged for this Spring.

For various ‘reasons track work has
not aroused as much interest hitherto as
it should at Davidson. ft is a form oft
athletics which is availible to every man,
and which will bring rich returns to
every man who trains to the best of his
ability.

Manager fohnson announces that the
University of South Carolina will give
Davidson a meet at Columbia this Spring
provided that Davidson gives them a_re
turn meet at Davidson this Spring alse.

It is honed that the Athletic Associa
tion and the Student Body will support
this proposition in order that this excel
lent form of athletics may advance in
interest and not decline,

ANNUAL WORK PROGRESSING.

The rgra-rs volume of “Quips and
Cranks” will be ready. it is hoped, about
the 20th of April. Foote & Davies Co.,
of Atlanta, has charge of the printing.
and this year’s Annual will probably sur
pass all its predecessors. A novel feature
has been emploved in the Senior section,
the nature of which will remain a pro-
found secret until the Annual is publish-
ed. One fact especially is being stressed
by the editors—that this vear there will
be no extra copies left, and that evervone
who wishes to get an Annual had best
to sign up for one immediately.

Sympathvw is extended to ‘Jin’ Mc-
Ceachern (*12), who has recently lost
his mother.

Varsity and “All-

Stars” Meet Friday

Much Interest.

Arrangement have been completed
for a Varsity "AllStar game ot base
ball to be pulled off at Sprani Athletic
Field, Friday afternoon, the game to be
called prémpely at g:ae-p. im.

This will be an added teature to the.
Junior Speaking gaities and the game is
to he onerot the regular dates of the
occasion.

Phe “Al Stars” 1s 10 be made up of
good ball plavers, and several well
known base ball celebrities will be on
the nine,

Carl Cashion, an old Davidson star
in both foot ball and base ball, will hold
down the initial bag. Far several vears
Cashion was one of. - Clark. Griffith's

mainstays on the mound. Since leav-

ang the Wasiington Americans, he has

been plaving with Undianapolis.

Harry Caldwell (of Morganton
fame) will) play second. For several
stammers he has ptaved with this town,
where he is noted for his good fielding
and heavy slugging.

Everett Booe, another Davidson star,
will be seen on short. Booe plaved two
vears with Fred Clarke’s Pittsburg Na-
tionals. Tle jumped to the Feds last
season, and made an enviable — record
with Indianapolis. the peanant winners
of that league. Booe reports at. their
training camp in Valdosta, Ga.. ina
short time.

Vhird base will be held down by
‘ Pere” Cravton, last venr’s captain.
Cravton has) plaved with Morristown
in the Appalachian, and Dillon in’ the
Pee Dee League.

Coach Fetzer wall do the catching for
the “AU-Stars.” After plaving on both
the foat ball and base ball teams at
Davidson, he maniazed and plaved with
several teams ins the Virginia League,
where he bolds the record for the longest
ball hit. and with Charlotte in the Caro-
line League.

The outer garden will be filled by
Frank Stouph; Cashion, of Huntersville,
brotler of Carl Cashion, and Spencer
Cranford, who plived for Concord last
vear,

Donaldson will decorate the mound
for the All-Stars. He is a twirler of
some repute, and did good wark — for
Asheville last vear.

With such a team as this the Varsity
will have its hands full, “Phis ts the
first time the students have had the op-
portunity to see their team ine action,
and the bleachers will) doubtless — be
crowded. — Lawson, Henpeveldt, and
Groom will all probably work during
the pame.

Coach Fetzer has done unusually fine
work, and Davidson has the prospects of
a good season, It is up to every student
to be out and back him and the team in
this first game. Show them vow are he-
hind them and stick with then through-
out the season.

Under the direction of Manager
Shaw and his assistants, Finley and Hill,
the field is in unusually good condition
for this carly in the season.

Season tickets will be good for this’
game, and the admission for non holders
and for ladies will be twenty-five cents.

Jack McCaskill, who has been con
fined in the Charlotte Sanatorium for
same time, with serious throat trouble,
has gone to his hame in Bainbridge, Ga.
It is not known whether or not he will
be able to return to college this year.
