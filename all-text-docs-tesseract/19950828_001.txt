New freshmen provide wealth of talent

By WILLIAM RoBERT

Davidson students seem to
keep getting smarter and smarter.
With the Class of 1999 arriving
from 39 states and 20 foreign coun-
tries to begin their Davidson ca-
reers this week, upperclassmen
again wonder how they compare
to the newest class.

Academically, the Class of
1999 is top-notch. It includes 38
high school valedictorians and 19
salutatorians. Nearly 80. percent
graduated in the top 10 percent of
their high school classes. Their
SAT scores range from 1190 to
1270 for the middle 50 percent of
the class.

Outside the classroom, they
continue to demonstrate their tal-
ents. The newest group of
Davidsonians includes a nation-
ally ranked gymnast, a bagpipe
player, an architect and interior

designer, a newspaper reporter,
several extremely gifted musicians,
and a playwrite. They have show-
cased their talents as close to home
as Charlotte and as far away as
New York’s Carnegie Hall as well
as France, Holland, and Denmark.

Of course, the class includes a
number of students who served as
high school student body presi-

- dents, yearbook and newspaper

editors, captains of athletic teams,
and volunteers who have travelled
to Mexico, Brazil, Kenya, Saudi
Arabia, New Zealand, Poland, and
other countries doing mission
work. Others have performed thou-
sands of hours in community ser-
vice projects across the country —

. from preparing brown bag lunches

for the homeless to working at
local hospitals.

The Class of 1999 is a very
talented bunch that, all around,

should give bppstebesamen a run
for their money. -

Student Health Center
responds to student demands

By JosH BUCHANAN
Operations Manager

In response to student body
pressure last year, the Student
Health Center has enacted some
major policy changes for the up-
coming semester.

Dr. David Staton, Director of
Student Health Services, feels that
the changes strongly reflect the
general dissatisfaction that students

expressed near the end of last se-
mester. The primary focus of these
changes center around Staton’s
desire to see “more physician time
for students.”

“Last year, the Physician’s
Assistant (PA) came after 5:00,
basically for referrals and to fill
out charts,” says Staton. This lim-
ited contact time between students

The PCC Plan: What’s that on your wrist?

By MatrTHew Erricu
News Editor

When the first parties of the
year occur tonight or tomorrow,
only those students with the small
white “PCC 1995” sticker on their
Cat cards will be admitted. This
new policy is the result of the de-
bate about independents and the
Court from last year.

In order to pay for the risk
management required by the Col-
lege and the houses’ insurance
policies, the fraternities and eating
houses will be charging indepen-

attend parties. Freshmen and trans-
fers will be exempt from paying
their first semester.

The houses’ insurance poli-
cies require that they host only
“closed” parties. A closed party is
defined by the insurance compa-
nies as one having a set guest list
and one which prevents non-regis-
tered students from attending. In
the past, the Davidson directory
was considered the guest list, but
in the last year the houses have
learned that this policy would ne-
gate their insurance policies if a
lawsuit was brought against a

How the plan will work
At the first party a student
attends on a given evening, he will

‘be required to pass through the

front door and display his ID with
the “PCC” sticker. He will then be
given acolored wristband that will
signify that he is over or under 21.
Every house that sponsors a party
on the same evening will use the

same colored wristbands, so once ~

a student checks in at one party, he

will not need to do so at another.
Students already affiliated

with a Court house and indepen-

dent students $10 per semester to house. | See AA on page 3 The PCC Plan —- Rob Koscki
