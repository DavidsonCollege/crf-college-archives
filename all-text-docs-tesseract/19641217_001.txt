Alumni European Tour
Draws Early Attention

In. the past ten days Bondu-

interest from approximately 40
alumni who wish to take advan-

price. Having mailed out over
14.000 pamphlets on the trip. .he
expects to hear from many
more alumni during the Christ-
mas holidays. :

The $310 first-class round trip
will begin on June 13. A Boeing

it will return by way of New

In order to secure such a low

persons besides the 37 mem-

presently trying to encourage
the Class of *40 and the Class
of ‘55 to have a special reunion
on board the ‘plane.

The college is not arranging a

Evaluation |
Is Planned

Religious life among Da-
vidson students will be
scrutinized in the months
ahead by the Faculty _Re-
ligious .Life Committee,
Chaplain Will Terry reveal-
ed yesterday.

The general religious life of
the college — including the pres-
ent vespers policy and student
religious attitudes — will be ex-
amined during the study, Terry
said.

Results of the study will be
submitted to the faculty by the
committee, which can only make
recommendations.

Meeting Wednesday. the com-
mittee heard a request from
petitioners concerned with the
Roman Catholic students who;
are required to attend Protes-,
tant services contrary to their
church's dictates.

Headed by Hobs Allan, the
petitioners requested permis-
sion to fulfill their vespers -re-

one of the Catholic churches in
Charlotte, Mooresville, or -Con-
cord.

The faculty committee defer-

The committee will study the
religious policies of the last two
years and recommend whatever
changes of policy it deems nec-

The News And Editorial Voice Of The Davidson College Student Body

SPECIAL
HOLIDAY
EDITION

NUMBER THIRTEEN

‘Students’ Vote Defeats

‘Ambiguous’ Proposal

New Alternative Slated |r

For Post-Holiday Vote

Students voted 383 to 87 against one proposed drinking rule change today while
another, more precisely worded amendment to the Student Body Constitution lay

! on the table awaiting presentation in a post-holiday referendum.

The resounding rejection of the amendment was prompted by the presenta-
tion of the newer and more clearly wordedproposal Tuesday.

The defeated amendment was originally set forth by Student Council but
lost the support of that body Monday night. At that time Council decided unanimous-
ly to cast its lot with the more spécific proposal which now awaits a student body

referendum.

The new amendment would
be added at the end of Section
2. Article VIII of the Student
Body Constitution. and would
read as follows: *’For the pur-

‘| pose of enforcing this regula-

tion with specific regard to the
possession of alcoholic liquors.
the trunks of automobiles shall
not be covered by the term
‘campus’.”’

The Council decided to pro-
pose the new. amendment to
avoid what President Will Jack-
son called “the absurd Joop-
holes and interpretative weak-
nesses" of the original proposal.

in conjunction with the new
ly proposed amendment. the
Council adopted a new declara-
tion of policy in which the
Council and the-Honor Court are
pledged “to earnestly support
and enforce the provisions’’ of
Section 2. Arti¢le VIII of the
Constitution, cven to the extent
of “searching dormitory rooms
or fraternity houses.”

According. to Jackson, the
new policy would give the two
bodies “the actual power to
search.” If a member suspect-
ed that liquor was being kept
in a room, “this suspicion would
entail notifying someone else
(another member) for the sake
of clarification and surety” be-
fore a search would be made.

In an effori to further clarify
the newly proposed amendment.
the Council. entered into a live-,
ly discussion as to the exact
defination of the term ‘‘trunk.”
‘contained in the new rule.

Av first. Jackson contended
that the Council, should make
some definite statement con-
cerning what ivould be viewed
as a “legal’’ trunk and what
would not. Bill Council respond-
ed by suggesting thal no precise
definition. of trunk be formulat-
ed in. order that the Council
might. decide this issue if a
“test case” came up.

Council Tables Stand
On Professor’s Oath

“Dean (Frontis W.) Johnson
and (Chaplain) Will Terry are
of the opinion that this is a
legitimate area for student con-
cern,” said Fred Sackett Mon-
day as he reminded Student
Council of its decision made
earlier this fall to take a stand
on the Faculty oath.

At that time there had been
some debate as to whether or
not. it was the Council's place
to take such a stand.

Sackett suggested that a.com-
mittee be set up for relating the
Council to various other cam-
pus organizations in an effort
to investigate. and prepare a
statement as to the Council's po
sition on the loyalty oath. He
thought that this could be ac-
complished by March.

Bill Council. however felt
that the motion should be tabl-
ed pending an investigation to
determine whether or not the
Council’s stand might interfere
with the plans of ‘the faculty
or administration in this field.
The Council decided that his
suggestion was advisable ‘and
planned the investigation.

A unanimous vote 10 propose
a new amendment to the drink-
ing rule for approval by the
Student Body terminated the
main item of business at the
Student Council's weekly meet-
ing Monday night.

Essentially, the new amend-
ment would make automobile
trunks ‘‘off campus’ with re-
spect to the possession of alco-
holic beverages on college prop-
erty. Jackson emphasized. how-
ever, that this did not permit

drinking in one’s ear trunk.
He went on to have the Coun-
cil make it its policy to rigor-
ously enforce the drinking rule
under the new amendment. Also
with regard to enforcement, he

suggested that the Honor Court
be advised to make a concise
definition of *‘automobile trunk”’
so as to prevent confusion.
Don Davidson, David Walker,
and Charlie Marshall missed the
meeting. ‘

In. the. discussion which en-
sued, numerous suggestions for
a definition of “trunk” were put
forward. Fred Sackett felt that
“a covered area outside the pas-
senger area’ would be suffi-
cient. Tom Frist thought that}
“any compartment over a
stated size’ would adequately
definite “trunk” while David
Powell felt that ‘a trunk:-like
place would be o.R.”

STATION WAGONS

Tommy Heffner suggested that
“yehiclés without conventional

automobile trunks’ not be con-]:

sidered as having off-campus
trunks. Jolin Barrow moved that

‘Mstation wagons not be consid

ected as legal places. for alco-
hol-*

As none of these proposals was
satisfactory to enough. Council
members to insure its passage
President Jackson finally sug-
gested. ‘that the interpretation
of “trunk be leftto the Honor
Court.

This proposa) was generally
agreed to by the Council. and
Jackson afterwards expressed
‘his hope that the Honor Court
would formulate. a statement of
what “trunk” ;would be defined
as before the student body votes
on the new amendment. after
Christmas,

In an effort to explain the
Council's reason for asking
that the original amendment be
rejected in order. that the new
one might be adopted, Jackson
appeared before the student
body on Monday and Tuesday
in what he termed “the Coun-
cil's stimulating Artist Series
lectures.” ,
