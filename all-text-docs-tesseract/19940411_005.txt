Policies including pass/fail and minimum GPA studied by EPC

By Jeff Kent
The Education Policies Com-
mittee recently discussed arevised
pass/fail policy, changes in stan-
dards of progress, and a new ap-
proach to retaking classes.

_ The EPC consists of a group
of eight faculty members and two
Student representatives from the
SGA. All new policies discussed
by the committee will commence
in the fall semester of the next

academic year.

The committe is currently dis-
cussing a new pass/fail policy that
would allow students a less rigid
and binding system of choosing
classes for pass/fail credit. One
proposed idea would allow stu-
dents to change a class from pass/
fail to normal credit later in the
semester.

Extending the deadline for the
pass/fail petitions has been an is-

sue of some debate. Despite con-
siderable discussion by the SGA
and other related organizations, the
EPC has not addressed the petition
issue yet, as they are waiting for a
final decision from the SGA.
The EPC recently passed a
new standard of progress. Under
the new design there will be a
minimal GPA required for sopho-
mores and juniors. To en-
ter the second year at Davidson

with good standing, students must
now receive at least a 1.6 GPA. If
they do not, then they will be placed
on academic probation, during
which they will receive advice
and counseling by the college to
help them improve their perfor-
mance.

For entry into the junior year,
students must now earn at least a
1.8 GPA; without this minimum
requirement, no students will be
invited back to Davidson for their
third year.

Dr. LouisOrtmayer, a faculty
member of the EPC, says that all
students have the right to appeal
for their return to Davidson if they

- fall in this category.

A minimum GPA for gradua-
tion was discussed by the commit-
tee, but the members decided that

ment in the student’s major is suf-
ficient. :

The committe is still debating a
new policy for retaking classes. ©
Dr. Ortmayer says that to “add
some flexibility to meet the new
standards of progress” a new sys-
tem has been presented.

Under this proposal, when stu-
dents retake classes, they could
count only the second grade in
their GPA. The first grade would
still be recorded on the official
transcript, but would not figure
into the GPA.

Thecurrent system allows stu-
dents to average the two grades.
Many faculty believe that if the
results of the first course are com-
pletely wiped away from the
student’s GPA, then there will bea
rush to retake courses to boost

The WDAV spring mebership drive hopes to garner 1900 members this week.

Cyclists promote AIDS awareness

By Court McBryde

“AIDS is an issue that con-
cerns and affects us all, and that is
why for the second year in a row
Bike Aid has selected this issue as
the theme of its trip,” said Bike Aid
Coordinator Julie Reevy.

Thissummer cyclists will con-
tinue a nine-year tradition by bik-
ing across the United States pro-

wmoting ALDS.and HIV, awareness......,.

Each group of cyclists follows a
different route and makes several
stops along the way to give presen-
tations to a variety of groups. The
presentations aim to reach small
communities, church youth groups,
and individuals, educating them
about AIDS and warning them of

its dangers.

Five routes will be taken this
summer, each with a different point
of departure and itinerary, but all
five groups of cyclists will meet
together at their final destination,
Washington, DC, on August 22.
Three ten-week trips depart from
Portland (focusing specifically on

Texas, will serve as the starting
point for a six-week trip beginning

' July 6. A group will leave July 31

for three-weeks from Montreal.
Bike Aid is currently in the
process of recruiting students to
participate in the event, in which
cyclists cover an average of 70

miles a day. Riders must raise
$2000 in pledges for their trip, all
of which will go to nationwide
AIDS and HIV projects. College-
age students from diverse national
and international backgrounds are
well represented, but there is no
age limit for participation.
Reevy, who participated in
Bike Aid last summer, says, “The

AS.-L0_...)

provide community links and to
link the different perspectives that
exist from town to town.”

cerning Bike Aid call (415) 431-
