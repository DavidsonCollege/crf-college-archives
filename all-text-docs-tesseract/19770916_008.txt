Solar energy provides safest power

By ROGER BROWN

In general, the higher a nation’s
standard of living, the higher its per
capita energy consumption. This
correlation suggests that much of
what we consume depends on energy-
either for synthesis, manufacture, or
transportation.

Similarly, increases in productivity
have been found to correspond very
closely with the quantity of energy
expended. While business praises its
entrepreneurship and labor points to
quality worksmanship as causes of
productivity increases, a more impor-
tant factor is probable technological
advances which require larger energy
expenditures. ;

The implications of an energy crisis
grow more severe as we discover how
intricately industrialization is tied
with energy consumption.

If we continue to use the quantities
of oil we used in 1976, and if all that
oil is produced domestically, we will
exhaust our estimated oil reserves
within 27 years. If consumption
grows at about 5 per cent each year,
as it has over the last 40 years,
reserves will be exhausted within 18
years.

We will not run out of oil in 18
years. We will be forced to either cut
back consumption or pay what by
today’s standards are outrageous
prices. Natural gas reserves are
smaller than petroleum. As last
winter’s natural gas shortage illu-

strates, we must either pay higher
costs or do without natural gas. The
Federal Power Commission estimates
supply to be even shorter this winter.
Our primary energy options have
both large potential and technological
know-how to utilize that potential.

Using methane trapped from sew-
age decay for cooking sounds like a
worthy and “‘natural”’ idea, but only if
you are planning to cook once a year.
The potential of waste decay is just
not great enough. To fuse hydrogen
into helium (like the sun) does
represent an enormous potential, but
technology is not just at an infant
level, in the sense that fusion reactors
now use more energy than they
produce, technology could be called
fetal.

Coal, nuclear power and solar
energy are the options whose costs are
bordering competitive, whose poten-
tials are significant and whose tech-
nology makes them operable. Conser-
vation is always a legitimate alterna-
tive to higher costs and shortages.

Coal is more than ten times more

plentiful than oil in the United States. ,

Our use of coal has been restricted by
environmental standards which effec-
tively increase the cost of coal. As we
become more desperate for a cheap
energy source, environmental con-
cerns may carry less weight.

Even though our coal reserves are
comparatively large, they will not
serve for more than 50 years if coal

becomes our prime fuel and if con-
sumption continues to grow.

Solar energy and nuclear energy
both will require long research and
implementation periods, so we must
make a decision now about the kind of
energy future we wish to build. Given
our limited funds for research, even a
difference in emphasis will be signifi-
cant.

To make decisions about the kind of
research we fund, an understanding of
both atlernatives is important. Nuc-
lear energy uses the heat energy
released in the splitting of certain
atomic nuclei to generate electricity.
Two major types of nuclear power
plants are in operation today: the
light water reactor and the breeder
reactor. The light water reactor uses
uranium -235 as its active element.
The supply of uranium-235 is severly
limited; its energy potential is just
slightly greater than the potential of
petroleum.

As a long-range energy alternative,
light water reactors fail categorically?
They are expensive to build, and the

‘fuel they use is limited. Within the

last two years, the cost of U-235 has
risen over 800 percent.

The McGuire Nuclear Power Sta-
tion is located within five miles of
Davidson. Duke Power expects the
plant to begin operations by 1979.
The McGuire plant is located on Lake
Norman as is‘the Marshall Coal Fired
Plant.

The Marshall plan has twice the ca-
pacity of McGuire, yet is costing five
times as much to build. A recent
study at MIT indicated plant costs
are rising 15 percent each year which
added to the tremendous fuel costs
and limited fuel supply make light
water reactors an absurd investment.

No long term plan for waste
disposal has been developed. Duke
Power plans to store the wastes
created at McGuire on the site until a
plan is developed. Among the many
waste products of any light water
plant like McQuire is plutonium, a
highly toxic radioactive substance.

Five grams of plutonium are esti-
mated to contain the equivalent of
20,000 lethal doses. A plant the size of
McGuire will produce about 450
pounds of plutonium annually and
store it adjacent to Lake Norman.
Spills have occured at other plants
although no serious injuries resulted;
but aleakageof plutonium into Lake
Norman could contaminate the area
ee devastate almost every level-of

e.

With a half life of over 24,000
years, plutonium is not a temporary
danger nor could it be localized if a
serious spill occured. As an example,
in the early testing days, Great
Britian and the United States
dumped quantities of nuclear wastes
into the deepest part of the ocean only
to find traces of the substances at the
surface within hours.

Breeder reactors use a more intense
reaction to utilize uranium-238 as a
fuel by converting it first to plutoni-
um. Since uranium-238 is very abun-
dant, the energy potential of breeders
is vast--100 times that of light water
reactors. But the advantages end
there.

Breeders cost even more than light
water reactors. The intense reaction
increases the likelihood of meltdown
or leakage and increases the costs of
maintenance. Rather that merely
producing plutonium as a wastepro-
duet, breeders use plutonium as a fuel
which multiplies the potential danger
of an accident.

Congress is considering the com-

mercialization of the nation’s first

breeder reactor, the Clinch River

Breeder in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. °
Such policy decisisons will determine

just how we invest our research

funds. Already, over $6,000,000,000

have been invested directly in nuclear

research. Adding reprocessing and

other indirect subsidies, that figure

becomes even greater.

A powerful lobbying effort is being
exerted in favor of the project by
workers in the nuclear energy field.
They see the Clinch River Project as a
key to the direction of our nation’s
energy future. The alternative to
commercialization is deferral. Experi-
mentation could be continued, but
deferral would allow us the freedom to
invest more of our efforts into solar
research.

Solar energy is a broad title for any
of the various methods of using the
sun’s energy. Unlike any of the fuels
previously discussed, the sun’s ener-
gy is practically unlimited. Once sys-
tems are designed to utilize solar ener-
gy, fuel costs are zero. Unlike mineral
resources, solar energy is diffuse and
not restricted to a mine or a well

Principally, our use of solar energy
would by through space heating and
cooling arid hot water heating until

technology on other areas such as .

solar cells and windmills develops.
Space heating technology is ready
now. Over 20 per cent of all our
energy use is for heating so within the
decade significant progress could be
made towards solar utilization.

Environmentally, solar energy
would be cleaner than any of the fuels
we Currently use and would impose no
risks comparable to those of nuclear
energy. At present, solar heating is
just becoming competitive with tradi-
tional fuels. Had solar enery been
given 6 billion dollars in research
subsidation, the competitive thresh-
old would have been passed long ago.

A program of coal utilization and
solar space heating in the immediate
term, coupled with conservation, then
evolving into solar power generating
facitlites could provide us a clean,
safe and plentiful energy source.
