Students Ask to Attend Meetings

Students at Williams College in Williamston, Mass.,
recently met with the college’s faculty Steering Com-
mittee and discussed three proposals they had drawn
up having to do with increased student particiation in
college government. The proposals read:(1) All
students should be allowed to attend the faculty
meetings. (2) Upon recognition of the chair, students
should be permitted to speak at the meetings. (3) A
complete record of the minutes should be published
after each meeting.

The Steering Committee met with the students to
persuade them that their proposals would stand little
chance of passing a faculty vote. All past attempts to
get students into faculty meetings have failed.
Motions on this subject in November of 1971 and in
January of 1972 both were overwhelmingly defeated.
At this last meeting, the Steering Committee said
that, regardless of its opinion on the proposals, they
would be presented to the general faculty meeting if
the students presenting them still wanted them to be
presented. However, the students decided to with-
draw their proposals because of the unfavorable
‘‘political climate’’ they feel now exists at the faculty
meetings on the question of whether to allow students
to attend and speak at them.

Clemson Organizes Voting Service

The student government at Clemson University has.
organized the university’s first service for student ab-
sentee voters. The program is designed to enable
resident student voters to vote on campus in the up-
coming national election with as little red tape, in-
volved as possible.

Student government officials, notary publics, and
typists will help the student fill out a ballot request
form which will be sent to the voter’s home county.
The absentee voter then will receive a voting ballot in
the mail within about seven days.

P.E. No Longer Mandatory

Mississippi State Uiversity recently abolished man-
datory physical education. Coach Paul Gregory,
head of the physical education department, said he
was not shocked over the outcome. ‘‘Physical
education is purely a service of the University to the
students,’’ he commented.

Mississippi State decided to make P.E. a voluntary,
three-hour course and award credit like any other
course. ‘“‘Those going out for P.E. will receive better
instruction and ,opportunities to participate,’’
Gregory said. “The course will be handled like any
other class, academically speaking. The student will
be able to choose his particular sport.”’

Coed Dislikes Male
Chauvinist Cartoon

To the Editor: - 1, for one, would appreciate
being treated as such.

I could not believe my eyes
when I turned to the editorial
page of THE DAVIDSONIAN
(22 September p. 4) this mor-
ning and saw your cartoon of
the ‘“‘Davidson woman". It is
undoubtably one of the most
blatant examples of male
chauvinism I have seen in a
long time. Not only is the car-
toon sexist, but I also consider it
downright degrading.

Vilas Says Paintings
Primarily About Paint

A Review

By GARY GARVIN
Staff Writer

Anybody who thinks that the
campus is isolated from the
‘outside world’’ probably
hasn't seen the Sally Vilas
exhibit in the Stowe Gallery.

An instructor of studio art at
the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, Miss
Vilas’s paintings are most
readily characterized by her
technique of application of paint
- the relationship established
between thick paint poured
directly on to the canvas and
flat subtle stains on unprimed
canvas.

This is why she says her
works are ‘“‘primarily about
paint.’ These thick statements
flow over and control the can-
vas in rich undulations and are
at odds with one another.

The glossy surface is con-
trasted against the flat, the
amorphic shape against the
geometric, and the transparent
against the opaque.

The flat stains are developed
by openings and gaps in the
thick forms, by an overlapping
of these forms, and even by ac-
tual cracks in the paint.

In several of her works, the
stain is qualified by a thick,
transparent covering. Depth is
more a physical than imaginary
phenomenon.

Beyond this general ap-
proach, her works vary in treat-

. ment of subject matter. For the

most part they are formal ab-
stract compositions based on
hard line geometric patterns
governed by the free flowing

thick forms, as in
‘“‘Prologomenon”’ or ‘*2 Up 3
Down".

In her *“‘Baroque Landscape”
the demands made by the
large rigid white margins force
the forms off the canvas into ac-
tual space.

The battle in ‘‘Night’s Best”
is fought within the margins by
an interraction of aggressive
forms and pure contrasting for-
ms.

She uses a more represen-
tational approach in other
works with varying effects. In
‘‘Moon Form” a large circular
form cast in a pallid blue
predominates, and it is en-

Ina lighter mood, Miss Vilas
jostles our palate by strings of
glossy white and yellow over a
flat brown and white hard line
patterned background in a work

Receiving both her B.F.A. and
M.F.A. at the University of Nor-
