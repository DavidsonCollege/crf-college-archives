ing, Crawford, and Price Star.

The Davidéon scrubs had a pleas-
ant and enjoyable trip to Winston
last Thursday. They were welcom-
ed at the station by several of the
Winston players and J. T. Maddrey,
an old Davidson student.

The game was fast and interest-
ing from start to finish and ended
with the Wild Kittens victors, score
52 to 23." Here are some extracts
from the Winston Journal: “The
game opened with Crawford poking
the first one there. Back came
Cardwell with a long shot half the
distance of the floor. Much credit
of the afternoon goes to Cardwell of
the locals and Crawford of the vis-
itors. Capt. Davis is due much credit
as he. was there and made no friends
among the Davidson five. Moore
and Logan put up a fine defense
game.” King played an outstanding
game at guard, tho from the number
of goals he shot, one might think he
caged seven baskets, shooting them
was a forward. During the game he
from every angle. Price at
stationary guard also played a good
game, breaking up plays coming and

oing. Also he shot his goal be-
fore the game was over. Brake
was right in the game and did his
part. Ormand went in the last few
minutes and caged three goals.

Again the Journal says: “David-
son scrubs have won a home here at
Winston for their clean, sportsman-
like play, and they have a wonderful
team. They just had us outclassed,
that’s all, and don’t think Capt.
Davis’ bunch didn’t fight.”

The scrubs wish to assure the
good people of Winston that they
enjoyed their many kindnesses and
the good time afforded them.

“Funny” Fulton is due much credit |R

as he 1s the one who planned a nice
reception for the fellows, also saw
that they had a good place to stay.

The line-up was as follows:

TRACK PROSPECTS.

Although it is early in the season
to make any statement concerning
the kind of a track team that will be
turned out this year, the prospects
are that we will have a team that
will be above the average. At the
first call for track men about twenty
five candidates presented themselves
and are practicing faithfully every

ay.

As a nucleus for a track team this
year we .have four of last years
etter men, and around these men
the team will be formed.

Men who are showing speed in

the sprints are Murray, Brice, Den-
niston, McGuire, Adams, P. O., Bet-
hea, and Gordon. Men trying out
for the High Jump and Pole Vault
are Garrett, Carr “Bob” Davidson,
and J. C. McCaskill. These men
are showing good form and a winner
should be developed. Those trying
out for the distances are Sprunt,
letter man from last year, Price, J-
K,, Dick, L. W., and Covington,
E. McLeod is handling the weights
this year and is showing much im-
provement over last year, having al-
teady equalled his last year’s mid-
season record,

The annual class track meet will
be held on ‘March 27, and after this
meet there will be contests with
Clemson, South Carolina, Trinity,
State meet, and Southern Inter-
collegiate meet.

I men who are going to try out
for the class track team and those
who are thinking of doing so will
be very much interested to know
that plans are underway to bring

ueens College up to Davidson on
the Field day on March 27. Let us

. hope that these plans work out and

HIGH SCHOOL TEAMS
STAGE FAST CONTEST.

Friday afternoon Davidson’s bas-
ketball court was the scene of the
game deciding the High School
Champion of Western North Caro-
lina. Belmont and Charlotte were
the schools represented and they
staged an excelfent game which was
attended by quite a number of the
students from both schools as well
as a large representation of the
Davidson student body.

From the very first the Charlotte
boys took the lead and though at
times Belmont showed good form
they never succeeded in finding the
pace set by their opponents. Leeper,
center of the Belmont team played
an especially good game and was
easily the star for the loosers. Moore
one of the Charlotte forwards, was
perha s the most outstanding mem-

er of his team. The winners seem-
ed to have most of the fine points
of the game at their disposal and
when the last ten minute quarter
was over the score stood, Charlotte
47, Belmont 17.

fine showing.

JUNIORS AND SENIORS
ORIGINATE LONG
NEEDED CUSTOM

The authority has been given to
the Junior and Senior classes to
establish the custom of having class
tings. This has been agitated for
some years but no action has been

.{taken on the matter till this year.

Sometime ago the Junior class pass-
ed a motion to buy them and then
submitted it to the Senior class in
order that they might co-operate
in getting them.

The result is that the ring has
been selected and those in the two
classes who desire them have put in

their orders. The ring that has been|.

chosen is a 10 d wt solid gold seal
ring. The seal is the college emblem
raised and set with a ruby. On the
band to one side of the seal is a D.
C., and on the other side the class
numeral. On the inside will be en-
graved the degree for which the
owner is a candidate. If enough of
the men will order them a reduction
in price wil be made so that they

as Recognition of Their Service.

The faithful have been rewarded.
Dave Roberts, in the spring of 1919,
conceived the idea of substantially
rewarding the members of the Re-
porters Club who did work of out-
standing merit. The Golden Quill
was the result.

The Davidsonian offered, at the
beginning of the present term, a
gold pin in the form of a quill to the
men who did the best work for the
publication this year. Only seven
men may receive the award in one
year, and among this number the
resident of the Reporters Club is
included ; ex officio. Those selected:
T. H. Spence, President ; E. N. Book-
er, W. P. Cumming, M. R. Doubles,
R. T. L. Liston, D. L. Mahood, J. M.
Richards.
