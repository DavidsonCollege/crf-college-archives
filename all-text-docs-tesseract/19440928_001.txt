OWENS STUDENT PRESIDENT

‘Y’ Plans
Fall Work

YMCA Cabinet Without A Per-
manent President

The Y. M. C. A. Cabinet: has al-
ready begun its fall work, but is, of
course, missing the services of a
permanent president. Jim Alexander
has been acting in that, capacity
and thanks are due him for his fine
work.

The members of the cabinet as-

sumed new responsibility this year
when, at the request of ‘the college,
they acted as the Committee on
Orientation. Returning to school
when the freshmen -arrived, each
member acted. counsellor for a group
of freshmen. The work during the
orientation period was an.enjoyable
and a profitable experience for the
men,

Plans.; for the future have not
been definitely formulated as yet,
but work will be in full swing in the
near future. Mimeographed ques-
tionnaires will be distributed in an
attempt’ to ascertain the fields in
which each student’s interests and
abilities lie. It is hoped that the
student body will cooperate in this
line.

The Sunday School Department,
under the direction of Marks Und-
erwood, is one in which there is
opportunity for a great amount of
service. Every Sunday there isa
need for boys to-go out into the
surrounding country and teach Sun-
day School.If those who are interest-
ed in teaching, either in the morning
or afternoon, will contact Under-
wood, they will greatly aid the cabi-
met and the work of the Y.

Boys’ Work is another department
which needs volunteers. Boy Scout
and Hi-Y groups need leaders and
workers, and those who are interest-
ed should contact Herb Wyatt.

In addition to Underwood and
Wyatt, the new cabinet is made up
of the following men: George Ap-
person, Community. Work; George
Gunn, World Evangelism and Chap-

el; Bruce Fisher, Social; Sonny
Blain, Publicity ; Ed Golden, Deputa-
tions; Vernon McGehee, Spiritual
Life.

This and That
From the ASTRP

By EUGENE BAKER

On September 2nd, the ASTRP
boys took off for all parts unknown:
South, East, and West. The. fellows
were overjoyed at the thoughts of
not having to get out of bed early,
not hearing bugle calls, and last but

not least, not having to attend
classes eight periods a day. The
only regret that was universal

among the ASTRP’s was the thought
of missing P. T. for a whole week.
Many tears were shed over this fact.

On the way going home many of
us stared out of the train windows
with our mouths drooling at the sight
of the full Harvest Moon in all its
splendor as we thought of the fol-
lowing night under the same moon.
(It was a swell night for fishing.)
Oh! by the way the National Sales
Committee! has reported a.sales in-

Davidson
Receives

Donations

One Gift From Dr. Pender
Porter of Brooklyn; Other
One Anonymous

Two surprise gifts to Davidson
College totalling $58,000.00 were re-
cently announced by President John
R. Cunningham.

One comes in the form of a schol
arship donated by a prominent and
loyal alumnus who -has long been
closely associated with the work of
the college, but who requested that
his name be withheld. The income
from this $10,000.00 scholarship funded
is to be appropriated yearly ‘to a
worthy student above the freshman
class in need of financial assistance.
He will be selected on the basis of
outstanding promise, indicated
character, personality, intellectual
ability and scholarship. The agree-
ment covering this scholarship con-
tains the following significant para-
graph: “The beneficiaries of
fund are not expected to repay any
part of the money received, but it is
hoped that many of them will be-
come men of means who will
disposed to help other worthy young
men in their efforts to
education at Davidson.” °

The other gift is represented by
a bequest of $48,900.00 in the will of
Dr. E. Pender Porter, a famous
gynecologist of Brooklyn, N. Y., wh
died during the early spring of this
year. A graduate of Davidson
1896, Dr. Porter is credited wit!
having been one ‘of three Davidson
College students who, in 1896, pro-
duced the first X-Ray photograph
in America.

These gifts will be of material help
in the expanding program and en-
larging service of the college, ac-
cording ‘to Dr. Cunningham. “In
these days of high operating costs,
reduced enrollment, ard lower in-
comes from invested capital, the col-
lege doubly welcomes such generous
expressions of interest and con-
fidence”, concluded President Cun-
ningham. _

Cunningham, speaking of the
value of education and the need for
a liberally educated leadership to
day, the president said, “As we begin
today the 108th regular session of
Davidson college we enter upon what
would now appear as almost certain
to prove a fateful year in the his

It will be at this point where col

The necessities of this war have re-
vealed to our populace generally
the distinctive values of college and
university training as perhaps never
before. It is to college students of
yesterday and today, and even, to-
morrow, that we must look for lead
ership in business, in education, in
statecraft, in politics, in the home.

capacity; you have the opportunity.
