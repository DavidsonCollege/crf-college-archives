Hang Gliding Comes To Davidson, Safety First

By IDA PHILLIPS
People who are looking for a sport to
share with their dogs should not overlook
hang gliding. Those who think that our
canine friends are not capable of par-
ticipating in such manually dexterous ac-
tivities are sadly misinformed.

Tuesday night, Davidson Outdoors
sponsored a visit by Kitty Hawk Kites
(KHK), which introduced a group of
Davidson students to hang gliding dogs
and people. KHK is a hang gliding
school located in Nags Head, N. C. The
visit involved a brief synopsis of the his-

College Bowl Buzzes In

By TIM WAPLES

Things seemed quiet in the Union last
Monday night. Too quiet. Get Out of the
Way won easily, as usual. Skeetshooters
and Idiots Savants also looked good,
winning by comfortbale margins. The
Fighting Catatonics and King Cobra both
showed that they can rack up some
points. The Surrogate Mothers and Ab-
solute Values performed as expected.
And then came the news from the Morri-
son Room: Sid’s Kids 110, the Neon
Gerbils 105.

The Kids ran their record to 2—1 and
even overshadowed the sparkling victory
of See Rock City. City parlayed great
team play from Karl Lorenz, Lucy Eve-
rett, Jodi Kinnett, and Diana Bohrer into
a 270-185 win over First Yeast Belch in
one of this year’s best matches to date.
The hard-luck Belch squad is now 1-2,
despite averaging almost 230 points per
game. In fact, Belch’s explosive offense
may have division rival Get Out of the
Way biting their nails, but Get’s John
Munson is not letting on, stating, “I’m
not afraid.”

The come-from-behind victory of
Sid’s Kids was clearly the highlight of
the evening, however. The Gerbils were
highly ranked going into the game, but
cagey Kid’s Coach Steve Hughes in-
serted defensive specialist and Vatican

authority Carolyn Meier, who shut down
the Gerbil offense. Last-minute heroics
by Barbara Brooks iced the victory for
the Kids, who are just half a game behind
I Phelta Thi in the rough-and-tumble AL
West. Kids team member Jennie Branch
responded to the tight pennant race by
saying, “Isn’t it exciting? And we’re not
even any good!”

Fiery competitor Barbara Brooks
brings a different attitude to the Kids.
Her response to the news that the Kids
were not scheduled to play this Monday
was characteristically aggressive: “I hate
it. I hate every night we don’t play Col-
lege Bowl.”

Experienced College Bowl specta-
tors are not at all surprised to witness the
ascendancy of yet another Coach Hughes
franchise. The wily Coach keeps it all in
perspective. Well-known for his discip-
linarian methods and devotion to Nauti-
lus training for all his team members,
Hughes has adapted his style to suit the
freewheeling Kids squad. In anexclusive
interview, Coach Hughes revealed the
Kids’ game plan: “We’re goin to keep
buzzing in whether we know the answers
or not.”

Even without Sid’s Kids, there will
be plenty of action in the Union on Mon-
day night. The Gerbils will try to avenge
themselves against undefeated I Phelta
Thi, while Get Out of the Way, Buzz Al-
drins, Relentless Picnic, Idiots Savants,
and the Skeetshooters all put 2-0 records
on the line. Wrong stuff, Section Eight,
King Cobra, and Elvis, Beat, Etc. won't
let their record’s blemishes keep them
from typically strong play.

One team which is glad to have the
week off is the Abslute Values, who have
lost more games than any other team in
the league. Values starter Sid Jones sees
no correlation between the Values’ prob-
lems and the success of Sid’s Kids, but
he does have some advice nonetheless:
“Just tell them to ‘stay as far away from
me as possible.’ There’s only so much
room to hide at Emanon, but Sid’s Kids’
Jennie Branch has her own reasons for
the team’s success: “We're just funny
people.”

tory of hang gliding and a film.

Although hang gliding has gained
popularity only recently, the sport has
been around since before the Wright
Brothers soared into history. In fact, the
daring duo probably borrowed some
ideas from those first hang gliders.

With the development of the air-
plane, the popularity of hang gliding de-
clined until the 1960’s. At this time,
people began building hang gliders that
not only got you off the ground (like the
first hang gliders) but kept you off the
ground (unlike the first hang gliders).
The most successful‘ hang glider was
fashioned by NASA for spacecraft. Fol-
lowing the example of a thrifty Scarlett
O’Hara, this first modern hang glider
was made out of a curtain.

Hang gliding has gained popularity
recently because of the many advances in
the gliders’ safety. Hang gliding was
given a bad name in the 1960’s due to
some unfortunate accidents. Soon after
the sport caught on in California, some

daredevils were killed while flying
homemade gliders composed of bamboo
and plastic. Recent innovations in the
structure of gliders and equipment, along
with the formation of USHGA (United
States Hang Gliding Association), have
made hang gliding much safer.

Besides the obvious necessity of a
hang glider, a minimal amount of equip-
ment is needed for the sport. Besides the
glider, only a harness and helmet are
needed to fly. Tony Veltes from KHK
modelled his spaghetti harness, which
was a nifty black getup with a lot of
straps hanging off the back. (No, it did
not resemble Joan Collins’ prom dress.)
Besides the rainbow and_ clouds
emblazoned on the front of the harness,
its most noticeable feature was that it
made Veltes look pregnant. The audi-
ence was relieved when he revealed that
the hump was a parachute to be used in
case of structural failure. Veltes then as-
sured the audience that, in spite of the
parachute, hang gliding is as safe as ski-

ing.
