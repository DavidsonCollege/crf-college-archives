The only things he ever did
Were chase wild women, wine and song

He wouldu’'t take a girl to ride
In his car onor even talk

Of doing it— because he said
That all of them could walk.

He took very few of them out in his boat,
And those few sure do hate him,

He said that boating was no fun,
Most all the girls can swim,

But he had a little aeroplane
That went into the sky,

He carried all the girls up there fj
Because they cannot fly.
