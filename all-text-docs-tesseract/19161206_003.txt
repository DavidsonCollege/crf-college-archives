The James Sprunt Lectures for the
current year at Union Theological
Seminary will be given by Charles Al-
phonso Smith, A.M., Ph.D., LL.D., Poe
Professor in English in the University
of Virginia, and an alumnus of David-
son. His subject will be ‘Keynote
Studies in Keynote Books.” He pro-
poses to take five books from the Old
Testament and five from the New and
show what they mean to him as wholes.

This is the first time a layman has
ever been chosen to deliver these lectures.
but the choice is one that will commend
itself at once to the whole Church, for
Dr. Smith is not only an eminent scholar.
lecturer- and author, but also an
eminent Bible teacher, a ruling elder in
the Church and an evangelical to the
core. His work as profesor in the Uni-
versities of Louisiana, North Carolina
and Virginia and as Roosevelt Professor
in the University of Berlin has made
him famous on two continents as one of
the most delightful and illuminating of
living lecturers. He has heen also a
prolific author, having now some ten
volumes to his credit, one, “O. Henry
Biography,” just from the press. The
lectures wi] be given in March.

THE FETZER DYNASTY.

As Davidson owes much to Coach
Fetzer for the success of the past season
and to him belongs the greater share of
the credit for the great work of the Red
and Black machine, below is given a
tribute which appeared in an Atlanta
paper following the Tech game. The
thoughts expressed therein should find a
ready second in all Davidson students
and alumni. a

“Fram the first shrill pipe of the ref-
eree's whistle calling the warriors to the
kick-off. to the final. heart-breaking
drone of the time-keepers’ double-
throated call, the spectators in the stands
at the Tech-Davidson game Saturday
were asking questions about Bill Fetzer,
the crack coach of the ‘Little Red and
Black Machine.’

“No such form before mid-season, ant
rarely on Turkey day itself, has ever
been manifested as was the work of
Davidson Saturday. Up at Davidson, a
little college not far out from Charlotte,
N. C., the oldest inhabitant and the
youngest will tell you that Davidson
owes her prestige in football in the past
decade in a large degree to the Fetzer
dynasty,

“It’s the dynasty that never says die.

“Four Fetzers have gone down as
great players for the Red and Black in
the annals of college history at David-
son—Monk. Bunch, Bill and Bob are
the monosyllabic array. Just before the
nineteen-fourteen football season at
Davidson, the word went out that the
‘Little Red and Black Machine’ was on
the down-grade.

“The little college had plenty of will-
ing workers, but their coach had left.
and where were they to get a good one,
when every team in the country at that
time was in crying need of a coach who
could drill the new brand of ball into
a lot of willing, but green rookies. No
Fetzer had been in school for some
years, but their names were still spoken
whenever the Halcyon days were . re-
called.

“Finally, the idea was born that one
of the Fetzers might help them out of a
gloomy looking season.

“Bob Fetzer was secured, and Bob
brought them back with a vengeance.
They sprurig several mid-season — sur-
prises and walloped everything around
their own weight on the schedule.

“But Bob's business interests made it
imperative that he should go to Mont-
gomery. For all stock at Davidson took
a decided slump when the word went
around that Bob was leaving. Then
things took a rapid rise. Weren't there
three more Fetzer brothers? Weren't
they all masters of the art of kicking.
carrying or stopping the old leather ap-
ple?

“Hadn't Monk played great ball at
Davidson, then three years at Cornell?
Weren't Bill and Bunch both masters
at the game?

“So Bill Fetzer was secured to come
back and guide his Alma Mater, the
college that every year turns out a ‘Lit-
tle Red and Black Machine.’

“Bill Fetzer assumed the head of the
coaching staff for nineteen-fifteen. When
time came for Bill to leave, Davidson
wouldn't let him. So Bill Fetzer took
the bunch that he had already loved and
cussed and coaxed one season, and the
result was that Virginia was scared out
of wits early in the season; North Caro-
lina A. & ML, whose prestige in the
Tar-heel State was a tradition, was
humbled a week ago; and Atlantans
had an opportunity to see for themselves
Saturday why the Davidson = men

son.

““Suppose Bill won't come back next
vear?’ a trembling Freshman at David-
son asked early this season.

““Bumph.’ was the reply, ‘Boy, don't
you know that we have got two more
of them who have never even been used
yet.!"

Here are the sixteen books which ex-
Mayor Gaynor believes have had the
largest effect on his life. ‘They are men
tioned in the order in which the Mavor
thinks he has been affected by them. ‘The
list does not include certain works on
what Mayor Gaynor calls the “philos
ophy of history” and from which he has
also derived great satisfaction. The
Mayor says, however, that if he had
taken more time some other books might
have been included in the list.

Euclid.

Shakespeare.

Hume's History of England (espe-
cially the notes.)

Homer.

THE BIRTH RATE OF THE
FOOLISH.

It is an axiom in the vernacular of
swindlers that a ready victim for thei:
operations is “born every minute.” 1:
would seem that this understates th:
birth rate of the credulous. Friday, the
thirteenth day of October, was an un-
lucky day for fifteen hundred such who
on that morning read in the Chicago
dailies of the disappearance from that
town of a firm of brokers dealing in
beautifully-engraved stock certificates.
Their well-furnished offices were vacant,
and a good deal of nice-looking paper.
printed as certificates of stock in can-
cerns with pretty names, was left be!
hind them. The daily papers report
that “they left an imposing list of cred
itors behind them and a financial tan
gle, involving their dealings with clients
said to number 1,500, including the
usual ratio ‘of ministers, women, small
shop-keepers, clerks, and the run of in
nocents who dabble in issues not appiov
ed by the experts.”

“The usual ratio of ministers, women,
small shopkeepers and clerks!”

not like that arrangement of the groups
affected. We have often been tempted
to add a financial column to The Ad-
vocate, not for our own profit, but as a
protection to those who have small sav-
ings and who so readily become victims
of sharks. We may never get around
to do it: but, meantime, let ministers,

women, smail shopkeepers and clerks
take good counsel before they invest
their money with strangers not well
