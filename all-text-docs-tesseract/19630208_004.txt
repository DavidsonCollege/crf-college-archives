Free Cuts Adjudaed OK

After A Semester's Practice

BY BILL LOGAN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

‘This year's cut system.” reports Dean of Students

Richard C. Burts, “has proved generally successful. There
doesn’t seem to be an overall increase in cutting.”

Although there was an in- sences as they did last year; (2)
erease in the number of auto- there is now no extra penalty

matic failures for lower than
75% attendance (nine students
in the fall semester. 1961-62, to
17 students in the fall semester,
1962-63). Burts is not unduly
concerned.

He said. he had expected that
some students would have to
learn'the hard way in using
their added freedom. He hopes
that these 17 students won't
repeat and that others will learn
from them, so that the number
of automatic failures will stead-
ily decrease.

There are three principal dif-
ferences in this year’s cut sys-
tem and last year’s system.
(1) Attendance records now

for cuts immediately before or
after a holiday: last year they
counted as double cuts; and (3)
last year’s system called for the
loss of all quality points after
four unexcused absences; there
is no such provision now.

This provision took quality
points from 260 students last
year, and its being excluded
this. year is what caused. some
expectation of increased cut-
ting.

Burts said that officials at a
neighboring institution have
been examining Davidson's cut
system and are planning to visit
our campus to help decide on a
proposal to adopt a similar sys-
tem.

Dr. T. O. Pinkerton. who was
‘at Trinity College, Hartford.
Conn., when they inaugurated
their new system. said that stud-
ents so abused their freedom

After working for 25 years
in the same office, he has
been replaced by an adding
machine. The play is a story
of the results. He is never
satisfied, even when he
reaches paradise.

Because of the universality of
the characters, Mrs. Hampton
commented, the actor must
“lose his individuality. In reali-
ty, he does: not represent any-
thing.” “Although it was written
in 1923. the play describes a
kind. man that is still present
today.” Zero is the “slave type,
mediocre spirit.”

Three students—Jon Miller,
Neal Bushoven, and Walter Ed-
gar—are now working part time
as replacements for Don Stowell.
fsoodykoontz stated that there
is still a staff shortage. “It is a
problem of quality without
quantity.”

Sailstad Becomes

Robert J. Sailstad. director of
Public Relations and Develop-
ment at Davidson College, was

elected chairman of the new|,

Vagabond Governing and Plan-
ning Board at a general meeting
of the members of the drama
organization last week.

The new board, which will
have general supervision of the
Vagabond program at Davidson,
is composed of 11 members: six
student representatives, two
community representatives. and
one each from the faculty and
administration. The Vagabond
director is the eleventh member.

ago because of the oath, said,
“1 can see no reason at all for

refused to comment.

Two other professors do see

Davidson faculty have been hon-
ored recently. Recipient of a
Danforth Teacher Grant for
1963-64 is J. B, Stroud, IIT while
political science instructor Eu-
gene F. Miller has been invited

tation,” Miller predicted. “1
look forward to it.”

ematics at Davidson was one of
40 faculty members _ selected
from 461 nominations from col-

its place on the walls of the recently created Greek Honorary Room in Oak Row.

No one can deny that Profes-

as to his story of where he

was dusted away in the Presi-
