Campus Comment

Response Good
To Lefty’s Cafe

Wednesday head basketball coach Lefty Drie-
sell bought the building now occupied by the Col.
lege Restaurant on Main Street.

in reply to the question, “What do you think
of Lefty Driesell’s plans to remodel the building
and open a restaurant featuring pizzas, fried
chicken and a special sandwich menu?” these
students said:

John Pancake, junior: ‘‘It would be
unfortunate if prices are higher. since
so many students eat there regularly.
It will be nice to have a place to get
something to eat at night. Mrs. Pratt
(Mrs. Margaret Pratt. former owner) -
is a real nice person.”

PANCAKE

Julian Prosser, senior: “‘The idea of ai
the restaurant is a very fine idea. |
wish they'd serve beer there. I regret ,
that some enterprising member of the
community did not think of this soon
er.”’ ,

~ PROSSER

re

Steve Fielder, sophomore: ‘‘The
4 Davidson community is long overdue
in providing a restaurant that caters
to student tastes. The student body
deserves a clean sandwich shop with
atmosphere within walking distance
of the college campus.”

While a typical summer
course concentrates on teach-
ing methods, Davidson's pro-
gram offered challenging
courses of study.

The program is sponsored
by the Mary Reynolds Bab-
cock Foundation. the North
Carolina Department of Pub-
lic Instruction and Davidson
College.

The program was set up
in two three-week sessions,
which include 10 courses
each. The classes had a fac-
ulty-student ratio of five to
one. Classes were held all
morning. and one course was
taken a session.

Courses offered were:
American literature, French
literature, contemporary
ethics. debate, economics, ge-
ometry, music, western civ-
ilization and theater.

The faculty consisted of 12
Davidson professors.

“The forces of this state have not been completely
mobilized to help the people of this state and to create
a better society,” John L. Stickley said here Monday.

The Charlotte textile executive and a leading con-
tender for the Republican nomination for governor of
North Carolina in 1968 spoke at the joint meeting of
the Davidson and Queens Young Republicans Clubs.

Stickley said that he plans to have a coalition
government with “qualified and dedicated” men and
will invite experts from all fields to contribute to the
quality of state government.

Characterizing himself as
“just right of center,"’ Stick-
ley called for fiscal responsi-
bility and less government
regulation of business. He
said, ‘You are the ones who
will bear the burden" for un
balanced budgets.

Because of **a lot of fat and
waste and inefficiency in our
appropriations.’ Stickley
plans to bring in experts who
will examine the state’s bud
get and will eliminate the
waste.

Social reform, according to
Stickley. is a necessary duty
of the state. Rioting. how
ever, is not the answer if the
state fails in its role. Stick
ley feels that rioting is sim-
ply a ‘“‘silly- excuse for ‘oot
ing. robbing. stealitig and
beating.”

Though he is against a
ruthless labor. Stickley said.
“I wouldn’t change the labor
laws. I believe in the right to
work and in the right to
strike.”

On national issues, Stickley
recommends that part of the
money taken in by the gov-
ernment from income taxes
be returned to the states for
use in state government and
in state education.

On Vietnam. Stickley urges
that the war be pursued with
‘more vigor.”

Predicting a Republican
sweep in 1968, Stickley feels
that he can beat the Demo-
cratic nominee for governor
and that the Democrats will
end up with only 44 per cent
of the vote.

Car Regulations
Same As Before

Assistant Dean of Students
Jim Terry said this week
that the traffic regulations
will remain the same _ this
year and will be enforced for
the protection of each stu-
dent.

Terry calls the student
body's attention to the rules
as listed on pages 66-68 in the
Wildcat Handbok. He espe-
cially noted that “easy pay”
envelopes for uncontested vio-
lations are located on a table
just north of 101 Chambers.
The check or cash may be
enclosed and placed in the
slot in the door to 102. Initial
violation is $1 with subse-
quent fines amounting to $3.

Terry emphasized familiar-
ization with the distinctions
between permanent and tem-
porary permits, the latter be-
ing good fot periods of less
than’ 14 days.

Temporary parking may be
sought at the fraternity court.
north of the gym, south of
the football stadium. west of
Cunningham and on Concord
Road. Terry requested stu-
dents to note also the re-
stricted areas.

He went on to state that

the college provides more
parking spaces than needed
for all registered cars. By a
recent count, there are up-
wards of 525 car slots, while
the total number of cars reg-
istered for this year is only
360 thus far.

Faculty
Meeting
Uneventful

The faculty convened brief-
ly Tuesday for what Robert
Sailstad, director of public
relations and development,
termed “a very uneventful
meeting.”

Since this was the first
meeting of the academic
year, most of the time was
devoted to introducing new
members to the problems the
faculty faced at the end of
school last summer.

Dr. Jay Ostwalt, registrar
and associate dean of the
faculty, reported on the data
processing procedure for reg-
istration.

Sailstad said the general
opinion of the faculty was
that the computerized regis-
tration was a good idea, but
many problems ‘remain to be
ironed out.

Davidson Student Helps
African Church Project

By ROB KREHBIEL
Staff Writer

Last summer Lyn Monta-
gue. a Davidson junior, flew
to Africa with plans to build
a church in a remote village
there.

Montague was sent on July
3 by the. Presbyterian
Churches in Pennsylvania
with eleven other carpenters
and teachers to the Spanish
province of Rio Muni. Six
members of the group spent
four weeks in Ocong where
they helped the natives build
a cinder block church.

According to Montague, the
group's aim was to make
contact with the people of
the village.

Without the American help.
the church project would
have taken much more time.

Montague mixed the ce-
ment and helped carry and
lay the cinder blocks, but
lack of tools and material
slowed the work.

As the African language is
a unique ‘‘dialect based on
tones,” Montague. an Eng
lish major, talked with the.
natives only in Spanish. !

volat, dimidio preti soliti voles.

Unum hoc incommodum est: circumstare debes
expectans sedem tibi paratam. Ceterum charta “YOUTH
FARE 1.D. CARD” per paucos dies non valebit: diebus festis
Gratiarum Actionis et Nativitatis Christi. Quibus excep-
tis, quando et quocumaue volare desiderabis dimidio

pretio volare tibi licebit.
Quid cunctaris? Obtine chartam!

We want everyone to fly

However, communication
was no problem. Montague
could play games with the
native boys. Or he could stop
at any kitchen in the village.
“I could end up having four
or five meals every day just
by visiting.’ he said.

Montague said that the ma-
terials ran out near the end
of his stay. If the coffee crop
is good, he feels that the job
wil! be completed by next
summer.

Montague also commented
that the school systems and
the medical service are poor
in Ocong. Since the natives

depend solely on the coffee
and cocoa crops for their liv-
ing. poverty is a definite
problem.
