that arise About $4,000 a year is handled
by the “Y”" board. This money is spent
on the Hand Book, FEresh Keception,
Sunday School literature, the movies,
and various other minor expenses. The

rd is made up of three faculty mem-
bers and five students, who are as fol-
lows: Dr. Arbuckle, chairman; FE. L.

pecially asked the students to show their
corvoperation by backing up the cabinet
next year and helping them in their re-
spective hranches of Christian work.

Pat. Crawford recognized the work of

At the same time a ¥. M. C, A. team,

E composed of Lewis Schenck, Rooster

campaign was planned hy the loeal Y.
M. C. \. and High School authorities.
Gordon Oltman and John Moore, both
reced of Davidson, being the

d chief prome ters.

The trip was a great success in every
way. The mectings were well attended
and the messages of the Davidson men
were simple, clearscut and effective, be-
ing characterized by that carnestness
and very evident sincerity of purpose

‘which is the surest guarantee of success
‘in work of this kind. The men are well

On last Saturday night “Anne of Green

to meet him, what is his surprise and
