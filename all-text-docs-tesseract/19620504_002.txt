A Swiss, The South, And Culture

Culture is an activity of thought, and receptiveness to beauty and humane
feeling. Scraps of infermation have nothing to do with it. A merely well-informed
is the most useless bore on God's earth. What we should aim at producing
is men who possess both culture and expert knowledge in some special direction.
Their expert knowledge will give them the ground to stert from, and their

culture will lead them as deep as philosophy and as high as art. .

- the valuable

intellectual development is self-development, end that takes place mostly between

the ages of sixteen and thirty.

(Alfred North Whitehead in The Aims of Education 1916)

Rudy Glarner, Rotary Interna-
tional scholar from Switzerland, said
what few native Americans could have
said so well as he gave the farewell
address from fourteen 1961-62 for-
eign students. He was listened: to at-
tentively and even applauded vigor-
ously.

Armed with 4 very British accent
and a minimum of funny-sounding
Gallicisms, Glarner praised U.S. indus-
trial achievements, said there was still
a great future for agriculture, and
spoke of our “highest” standard of
living based on wealth and power .. .
and untilled land.

He expressed surprise at the
weigtity influence of the Church, its
continued popular importance as a
cloak lending respectability to many
aspects of American life. And he said
that while in this country he had
missed ‘‘culture’” very much, “the
opera, the concerts, the ballet...
you know.”

Glarner’s speech might have
brought to mind the diverse faces, ac-
cents, and reactions of many foreign
students at Davidson in the last few
years. It is ironically consistent that
Glarner, son of a member of the Swiss
Parliament, should seem to moderate
the wide spectrum of foreign reaction
to this country and this college. His
criticisms were not as harsh as some
have been, yet they seemed much
more honest and supportable.

We were surprised that in a
speech intentionally general and ob-
jective a European chose to observe
the lack of “culture” in this country,
or at least in this section of the coun-
try. In all fairness to this region we
must object that in most southern
cities at least there is no lack of cul-
ture but rather a pervading lack of
interest (by a majority) in what usual-
ly goes under the banner of “culture.”

This lack of interest can be traced
historically for two and a half cen-
‘turies—even in Charleston. More re-
cently it can be traced immediately
to nouveau riche homes where money
is not backed by wisdom, taste or sen-

sitivity. It can also be traced to the
South’s lack of a cultural heritage, a
sense of. rebellion against the Old
Order or history, as one finds it in the
intellectual history of New England.

And any lack of interest in cul-
ture must inevitably rest in education-
al resources which have been’ com-
paratively scarce and inferior. As Wil-
iam Cash concluded, there is also a
terrific current of anti-intellectualism
in the southern mind. There is an his-
torical and tragic refusal to admit the
power of ideas or to admit new ideas
for consideration.

But a southern revival is upon us
and now even Charlotte, long a
bastion of Puritanism, has several
assable drama groups, a middling-to-
air symphony orchestra. an artists’
league, its own opera company, and
several good choral organizations. And
the state of North Carolina now sup-
ports its own symphony. Education is
coming along—southern education is
now only about twenty years behind
New England.

Yet it was probably our very
wasteland of culture, culture in the
most effete sense, that in this century
produced artists like Thomas Wolfe
and William Faulkner. These were
artists undisciptined by a cultural
heritage who fell into an anarchistic
individualism—the form in their work
is a rebellion against form, a European
influence. But somehow they felt call-
ed to agonize over their native region
and to draw meaning from the agony.
They were fascinated by the arid
desert of the South and its sense of
defeat. Faulkner found in the sordid-
ness of Mississippi the courage to say
at Stockholm, before all Europe, “hu-
man striving will go on in the face of
any obstacle; the flame will not be
extinguished.”

We apologize for our lack of cul-
ture here in the South. We cannot
speak for the rest of the country. We
know somehow that we as individuals
and Davidson College are irrevocably
a part of the tragic night and the cul-
tural re-awakening of our southern
‘province.

A New Examination

A closed circle . . . This, in many
respects, would accurately describe
the way by which most courses are
changed at Davidson. A ‘professor
teaching a basic course year after
year makes only those improvements
which he, as one who is intimately
involved, can see are needed.

_ Of course many helpful sugges-
tions are received through channels
within the teaching profession. But it
is usually a long journey from the
generalized statement to the particu-
lar case; and few are the ideas that
can make it.

Colleagues are certainly a helpful
factor, but how can one know an-
other’s teaching method if he has
never visited the classroom? It is
essentially a problem of relevance.

A valuable source of suggestion
for effective change is in most cases
not being used — the students. In-
formal chats after class or vespers
seldom get down to handling what in
the student’s mind, may be a funda-
mental problem in a course. The rare
occasion where a professor get a glim-
mer of mass discontent is probably
only when a temper is lost. And gen-
tlemen don’t lose their tempers.

EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
BUSINESS MANAGER

We would like to suggest a form
of evaluation that would be incorpor-
ated with exam. Both the Psychology
Department and the Music Depart-
ment now distribute, with the final
exam, sheets of questions for students
concerning the nature of the course
and the effectiveness with which it
was presented. These are written
separate from the exam and consider-
ed by the professor after grades are
turned in.

Such a series of questions would
cover the student's conception of the
purpose of the course, whether he
felt it reached his reasonable expecta-
tions, comments on the material used,
and his opinions of the student-teach-
er relationship that existed.

Although there would have to be
a certain amount of critical weighing
of the results, we think the construc-
tive changes suggested would, without
a doubt, make such a series worth-
while. For this reason we hope each
department will consider using such
a form.

Many times there are two sides to
every question — even if they are
both subjective. BH

Carrell: NSA Merits
Further Consideration

BY DANNY CARRELL
Student Body President

Last weekend I had the op-
portunity to attend the Caro-
linas-Virginia Regional Meeting
of the National Student Associa-
tion. The conference was held
at Belmont Abbey and was well
attended by representatives
from schools such as Sweet
Briar, Randolph-Macon, Caro-
lina, Duke, and U. Va. I am
pleased to report that as a result
of the conference, I am very
enthusiastic over the NSA; how-
ever, 1 am going to reserve final
judgment of it untill after I at
tend the National Student Con-
gress in August.

In the last issue of THE DAV-
IDSONIAN, Al Edgar painted a
somewhat distorted picture of
the NSA. I feel I should im
mediately set the record straight
by providing a more open-mind-
ed view of the organization. It
is true that the NSA, because of
some of its political stands, has
projected itself, in the minds of
some conservatives, as an organ.
ization which is so far to the
left that it should be avoided.

OPEN FORUM

Many of the NSA leaders re-
alized that one of the key chal-
lenges facing the organization
today is to erase its political
and liberal label and to project
an image of an open forum of
Américan students. In other
words, the questions that NSA
must answer this sumnier are:
Should NSA concentrate on po-
litical education only or should
it also take political stands? If
it should take political stands,
which ones should it take?

Mr. Edgar seems to be against
the NSA for two primary rea-
sons: First, it is too liberal;
secondly, it is undemocratic. Its
liberalism cannot be denied;
however, I ask whether the fact
that it is liberal makes it bad.
Mr. Edgar's argument about un-
democratic contro] has no valid-
ity whatsoever. He is critical of
the National Executive Commit-
tee which, is composed of region-
al officers elected by delegates
to the regional conferences.

As elected representatives,
they have the right to make cer-
tain resolutions; however, they
are primarily concerned with
carrying out the Basic Policy
Declarations, both political and
non-political, all of which have
been passed on the floor of the
Congress. Resolutions of the
Committee itself are subject to
repeal by the Congress.

1 wish to point out that there
is a definite conservative trend
in the NSA. Tim Zagat, Vice-
President. of NSA and former
Vice-President of the Student
Body at Harvard, attended the
Belmont Regional; and I can
assure Mr. Edgar that Tim’s
political views do not “lean de-
cidedly to the left.” Further-
more, conservative spokesman
William F. Buckley, Jr. attend-
ed the Congress last summer as
a guest of the Student Body
President of Harvard College.

LIBERALS ORGANIZED

In the past. liberal policies
have been passed, and liberal
officers have oeen elected be-
cause the liberals have been
better organized, and the con-
servatives have had little or

PEANLES

nothing to offer to the Con-
gress. I feel that Davidson and
other conservative southern
schools should not turn their
backs on the organization but
should work with schools such
as Harvard to prevent the NSA
from going to the extreme left.

Mr. Edgar further states that
NSA “counts every Davidson
student as a supporter of its
policies.” This statement is too
naive for comment. He is criti-
cal of the Davidson Student
Council for joining the organiza-
tion. I would like to point out
that the Student Council re-
serves the right to use its allot-
ted funds in any way that it
chooses.

One very important point that
Mr. Edgar omits in his article is
that NSA’s purpose is only one-
third political. Mr. Edgar light-
ly passes over its educational
and service aspects. The NSA
offers many ideas on how to im-
prove student government. It
provides information on public

speakers and conferences. Its’

European travel program is very
extensive and offers tremend-
ous savings.

Also, two important service
projects are ‘currently being
worked out. One is a nation-wide

“student insurance program. An-

other is a system of youth hos-
tels set up at Howard Johnson
Motels which would allow stud-

* ents rooms for only one dollar

a night.
DECREASE PROVINCIALISM

On the whole, therefore, I
feel that the NSA merits further
consideration. If the Council
votes next fall to stay in the
organization, I will see to it that
the student body is kept fully
informed on NSA activities.
Futhermore, work with the NSA
will not be restricted to mem-
bers of the Student Council. It
is true that only about 400, or
one-third of the tolleges and
universities of the United States
belong to the NSA, but includ-
ed in this 400 are most of the
colleges recognized as leading
academic institutions.

The NSA gives Davidson an
opportunity to decrease its pro-
vincialism and to find out what
is happening on other college
campuses throughout the coun-
try. Since its founding in 1946,
it has been endorsed by Presi-
dents Truman, Eisenhower, and
Kennedy. Private foundations
such as Ford, Carnegie, and
Rockefeller annually contribute
$480,000 to NSA’s $500,000 bud-
get. Obviously, many responsi.
ble people are firmly convinced
of the value of the National
Student Association.

THE CONSERVATIVE MIND

Atkins Attacks 'NewDeal
Ideas’ In ECA Program

BY CLAY ATKINS

Most Americans imagine that the entire world stands
in awe of our way of doing things and that every nation
would mortgage its collective soul to duplicate our capa-
city for forging ahead. At one time this may have been
true. But the farther we move away from our constitu-
tional tradition the less we are emulated.

Our leaders must come to realize that the underlying
weakness of the American economy is the present quasi-
socialistic system. Our government cannot forever
promise more money to more people for doing less work,
or no work, and maintain the American standard of living
and production.

Let us look at West Germany. Over a decade
ago a report was framed for the Economic Co-opera-
tion Administration by Walter Heller, Alvin Hansen
and Richard Musgrave (all are now on Kennedy's
Economie Council).

After surveying the facts of the West German
economy, the American ECA team presented a series of
recommendations paralleling in many respects those
outlined by Mr. Kennedy as a means of stimulating full
employment and economic growth in the U.S. The ECA
proposals stressed the importance of “easy money.”

hey told the Germans not to worry about inflation and
advocated increased public expenditures.

At the time of the ECA proposals Germany had 1.3
million out of work and was only six-years removed from
the devastation of the war. Yet the Germans had the
vision and fortitude to reject the ECA program. Ludwig
Erhard (Economics Minister) cast out the New Deal ideas
and proposed reliance on ‘private initiative rather than
government planning. He kept Germany’s interest rates
high and placed importance on curbing inflation by
holding down wages and prices.

The result, of course, has been one of the most
remarkable economic booms in the postwar world.
Today Germany faces a labor shortage. Workers
are actually emigrating from Spain and Italy in
search of jobs.

It is curious, that the ECA should try to pass off a
New Deal formula and that the Germans should turn out
to be better “Americans” than those who come from
America to reshape the German economy. It is also
curious that those men whom the Germans were wise

enough to ignore should now be formulating our U.S.
cy.

economic po

Is the New Frontier’s economic outlook really new?
Far from it. This system is so tired and discredited that
civilizations as old as Germany have already rejected it.
The American free-enterprise system is working remark-

ably well — everywhere but

where it was born.

Southerners Deny
Justice To Negroes

BY WALTER CLARK

The film, “Judgment at Nur-
emburg,” brought to mind
startling similarities between
the educated German's attitude
toward the slaughter of Jews
under Hitler and our own atti-
tude toward injustice to Negroes
under Jim Crow. The suppres-
sion of Negro and Jew is not
parallel, but the attitude of the
educated professional men of
both countries seems strikingly
similar.

The film indicated the Ger-
mans’ willful oversight of atro-
cious war crimes and their de-
fense against world opinion fol-
lowing the discovery of these
inhuman acts. Many of their
arguments on their behalf seem
plausible. No doubt most Ger.
mans were human to Jews in
day to day contact. No doubt
there was a widespread fear
that the German nation would
be irrevocably lost if Hitler's
war machine were not support-
ed regardless of its abnormal
aspects. No doubt they did not
know exactly what was being
done to Jews in concentration
camps.

But one man’s confession of
guilt shattered all their argu-
ments. Their willingness: to
overlook man’s inhumanity to
man could not be justified.
But such an oversight is not
unique to the Germans.

We educated Southerners
have also overlooked injustice
to a minority. The crimes are
not as flagrant or as numerous;
we are not under the pressures
of a world war. But when a
white is sentenced lightly for
the rape of a Negro, while Ne-
groes are sometimes executed
for a similar crime against a
white, we turn our backs. This
is only one of the inequalities
which allow those who know no
better to take advantage of a
minority race.

There are also economic and

social injustices. In many towns,
Negro streets are left in ill re-
pair, city services are irregular,
and the law remains silent. We
‘who are educated know better,
but we allow these inequalities
to continue.

Now all of us are being
judged by the courts and Con-
gress. We are being forced to
defend our position, end de-
fense is easy. We fear that
state and individual rights:
will be swatiowed up by 2
monolithic government. We
fear that equality will tead to
inter.marriage which will be
genetically damaging. We
personally have committed no
crime to Negroes.

But this last defense is in
reality a confession. We who are
educated treat Negroes as hu-
man beings. I have never seen
a Davidson student act toward
@ Negro in such a way that
would imply that the Negro was
subnonmal mentally or less than
human. We know that these
charges would be psychological-
ly damaging. Thus, our personal
consideration toward the in-
dividual shows that we think the
Negro as human as we are, as
capable of suffering and fear.

But the world only reads of
the flagrant violations, the pub-
licized inequalities which our
law allows. We who know bet-
ter must side with the world;
otherwise we will be judged for
our oversights. The fears of
monolithic government and cul-
tural deterioration are no justi-
fication for allowing the less
educated, the narrow minded,
the perverted of our own race
to get by with injustice to a
minority.

We must admit openly and
publicly that our laws allow
crime in political, economic, and
social affairs, and we must move
to correct ourselves for the wel-
fare of the South.
