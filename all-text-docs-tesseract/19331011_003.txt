Dr. Raynal | Speaks
At Sunday Vespers

Inspires Students to Improve
Existing Conditions Through
Christian Religion

GOOD ATTENDANCE

Audience Hears Scholarly and
Inspiring Talk

At the weekly vespers service last
Sunday evening, a large audience en-
joyed a short talk presented by Dr.
C. E, Raynal, pastor of the First Pres-
byterian Church of Statesville. Dr.
Raynal, well known to many of the
Davidson students, proved himself to
be a profound scholar and a powerful
speaker,

Bob Coit was in charge of the serv-
ice and Tommy Phifer led in prayer.
The singing was conducted by Hubert
Morris, with special music being ren-
dered in the form of a piano solo by
Kenneth Scott.

Dr. Raynal chose as his text the six-
teenth verse of the fifth chapter of
Ephesians, “Redeeming the time be-
cause the days are evil.” Elaborating
on this text, Dr. Raynal stated that
conditions in this world are far from
ideal, “Our living conditions, our as-
sociations with

we would like them to be.” Stress is
placed on the word “because,” in the
text. Because things are not as we
would like them is more reason that
we should look to God and trust im-
plicitly in Him. A President of, the
United States once stated, according
to Dr. Raynal, that the recovery of
the world would not be due to eco-
nomic recovery, but to spiritual re-
awakening. In conclusion, Dr. Raynal
reiterated the words of his text, “ Re-
deeming the time because the days are
evil.”

The annual Davidson College ping-
pong tournament is now in full swing.
Forty-five of the students of this in-
stitution are battling it out in the ping-
pong room of the Y. M. C. A. this
week for the honor of champion ping-
ponger of Davidson.

The winner of last year’s tournament
graduated’in June and by so doing left
his title here to be won by the winner
of this year’s contest. Harry Mixon
was the winner of the last tournament,

Boys from the Freshman class to
the Senior class are listed in the play-
ing column. Football players, track
men, basketball players, and tennis
players aré to be engaged this week
in seeking after this honor, which will
show that ping-pong is the game by
which to prove what type of sport pro-
duces the best men.

A list of the pairings and the win-
ners of what few matches have been
played are posted in the hall of the
Y. M. C. A. By referring to this dia-
grammed form of the procedure of
this tournament you may see who is
ahead and whether or not football pro-
duces better men than the other sports.

The prize to go to the winner of
this year’s tournament is five free
passes to the Davidson picture show.

These interesting contests between
contestants for the title of champion
ping-ponger may be witnessed every
afternoon and night for the next week.

Fresh Game

As announced in The David-
sonian last week, the Davidson
freshman eleven will meet the
N. C. State freshmen on Rich-
ardson Field, Friday, October 13.
The game will begin at 3 o'clock.

State brings a powerful fresh-
man eleven here, and the Wild-
kittens expect a hard scrap.
Coaches Laird and Peabody will,
in all probability, use the same
line-up that started against Lees-
McRae.

Eu’s Discuss Hitler |

And His Intolerance!
|

At the regular meeting of the Eu-
menean Literary Society Tuesday night |
an extemporaneous debate on Hitler
and his actions toward the Jews was
the central part of the program. In
this spontaneous discussion it was
brought out that no nation could pros-
per when its intolerant actions were
disapproved of by her sister nations.
Speculation as to the future of Hitler
himself ranged from his starting a ma-
jor conflagration to his being assassi-
nated within a year.

Another portion of the program was
directed toward the installation of new
members. A large part of the Fresh-
man class intellect was inducted, much
interest evidently being shown this
year, |

The topics for discussion this year |
are unusually attractive and students
will find it worth their while to attend.

what makes

HAT makes anything taste
better? It’s what is jn it
that makes a thing taste better.
CHESTERFIELDS taste better be-
cause we buy ripe tobaccos. These
ripe tobaccos are aged two and a
half years—thirty months. During
this time the tobaccos improve—
just like wine improves by ageing.
CHESTERFIELDS taste better be-
cause they have the right kind of
home-grown tobaccos and Turkish
Tobaccos ‘‘welded together.”
We hope this answers your
question.
