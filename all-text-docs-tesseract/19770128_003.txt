Freeland bequeaths stamps

By ANTHONY EVERMAN
Staff Writer
The Reverend Paul Free-
land, a 1925 alumnus, who
died November 1, willed Dav-
idson College $500,000 from
the receipts of his stamp col-
lections, which has been val-
ued of more than $1 million.
“Since the grant is unrestri-
cted, we will place it in our
primary fund, the college en-
dowment, so that income from
it will benefit students for
years to come,’ said College
President Samuel R. Spencer,
dr.
In addition, Freeland has
also established a $150,000
trust fund which passed to

Davidson upon his death.
Freeland has always been
noted for his altruism. ‘Paul
Freeland has had a special
devotion to Davidson. He was
a most thoughtful person and

this bequest is characteristié’

of his thoughtfulness,” said
Spencer.

The $500,000 gift is the
largest that the college has
received since commencing its
$35 million fund drive:

Former North Carolina
Governor James Holshouser,
Jr., commented on the impor-
tance of the Freeland bequest.

what we hope will be many

community and the academic
community,” said Hampton.

College coriseivesenergy,
avoids shortage crisis

By GAIL MAYNARD
Staff Writer

No energy crisis will occur
at Davidson this winter like
the shortages other colleges
across the nation have suf-
fered.

‘‘No one needs to be con-
cerned about Davidson Gol-
lege running out of energy,”’
said Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze, Jr.

‘‘A good deal of time has
been spent in planning ahead
in case of an emergency,” he
said.

Other colleges across the
nation, such as Ohio State and
the University of Pittsburgh,
have had to either extend
holiday vacations or cancel

idson’s resources in the next
ten years.”

After graduating from Dav-
idson, Freeland studied at
Union Theological Seminary
and was ordained to the
ministry in 1928. He later
studied at the University of
Edinborough.

For 20 years he was a pastor
in Louisiana and Oklahomal.
He was named Secretary to
the Overseas Relief and Inter-
church Aid Department of the
Board of World Missions of
Presbyterian Church in 1950
and served until 1963.

Upon his retirement in 1963,
Davidson awarded him the
honorary doctor of divinity
degree. The citation read in
part: ‘‘Pastor, author, lec-
turer, serving in many lands...
A recognized specialist, in Ar-
ab-Israeli affairs...Life dedi-
cated to the glory of God and
the relief of man’s estate,
doing the truth of Christ as
opportunity offered through-
out the world...”’

An avid collector, Freeland
had assembled a number of
historic Abraham Lincoln ma-
terials, ecclesiastical commu-
nion tokens, Confederate mon-
ey and books.

Only Six Miles North —

classes until fuel could be
obtained.

Davidson College will not
have to resort to these meas-
ures, according to Meetze.

Meetze states that oil has
been stored as a standby fuel
for gas since the gas shortage
about five years ago. This

_ reserve will supply the col-

lege’s needs amply unless a
drastic energy-loss emergency
occurs, he explained.

To conserve energy, the
maintenance department em-
ploys an ‘‘on-and-off’’ system
of cutting the heat off in
dormitories while students are
in class, then turning it on
again the afternoon, said
Meetze.

Concerning future fuel shor-
tages, Meetze stated, ‘“‘Every-
one will have to be prepared to
exist under lower tempera-
tures.

“Tt’s not the shortage of fuel
at Davidson, but the rising
cost of it that is important to
consider.”’

Meetze stated that the

‘‘severity of this winter will
cause an increase in fuel costs;

however, the overall price of
fuei goes up every year any-
way.”

He said that the cost of fuel
has more than doubled in the
last five years.

The cost of heating the
campus for this winter will not
be known until the year’s end,
Meetze explained.

From last year’s figures,
Business Manager Robert
Currie calculated that each
student pays approximately
$117 towards the total heating
bill.

Davidson College possesses
a Honeywell Delta 1000 com-
puter unit in the library as ‘‘a
last phase in energy conser-
vation,’’ said Meetze.

Although the computer
won't be used until money is
available to operate it at full
capacity, the unit will event-
ually control the amount of
power béing used over the
entire campus, stated Meetze.

Meetze suggests that stu-
dents turn off the lights when
leaving dorm rooms and to
keep their windows closed to

conserve energy:
