_ Most students relied on the usual planes,
trains, and automobiles to transport them
home for the holidays.

For a change of pace, however, sopho-
mores Jay Clugston and Ed Matthews de-
cided to bike from Davidson to Gainesville,.

_Fla., Clugston’s home, over Thanksgiving —— a

break.

“T guess we first got interested i in cycling
last spring when we took the P.E. course,”
said Matthews. This introduction to the
sport, along with the opportunity to pur-
chase new bikes, sparked plans for the long
trip.

The five-day journey presented a definite
challenge. Both Clugston and Matthews
were in excellent physical condition from
running, cycling, and various other sports.
However, their daily biking distance had
rarely exceeded 50 miles, while they would
have to bicycle about 100 miles per day in
order to make their trip to Gainesville.
Also, they would be riding with the addi-
tional weight of supplies for the first time.

After finishing finals, Clugston and
Matthews began their adventure . . .

_ Thursday, November 19 -- The pair left
Davidson at around 1:20 P.M. and were
seen off by a small group of supporters.
Their route took them through Charlotte,
past the famous landmark of Heritage USA,
and finally to Winthrop College where they
stayed overnight with friends. They had
covered 49.4 miles on their first day.
Friday -- According to Clugston,
tough, tough day.” On their bikes at 7:25

Spoof O' the Week

A.M., the two had to ride through early
morning fog. Ridgeway, S.C., was their

first stop. They ate lunch with members of :

the crew from the movie “Boys’ Life”
which was being filmed there.

They spent the rest of their afternoon
riding uphill and directly into the wind.
Around, 11:30 P.M. they finally reached
Swansea. However, upon arriving they
discovered that there were no motels or
campsites in town.

After asking around, they were directed 8
miles further on to North, S.C. For $10 they
rented a motel room for the night and used
the small heater in the room to cook their
dinner. Distance for the day totaled 105
miles.

Saturday -- Off to an early start again at

7:30 A.M., Clugston and Matthews contin- —
ued through various small towns. They

agreed that talking with people they met

along the way was one of the highlights of
the trip. At one town, they stopped to help
a man with car trouble.

When Clugston and Matthews reached
Pembroke, Ga., they were again confronted
with the problem of having no place to
sleep.

After contacting local police tox advice,
they decided to go an extra 24 miles through
Fort Stewart, a military base. It was proba-
bly the longest 24 miles of the trip, for they
had to cross the woods of the base on roads
where bicycles were clearly prohibited.
The darkness provided an extra challenge.

But as Clugston put it, “We decided that
alittle nighttime undercover maneuevering
would make a memorable experience as
well as taking us to a warm Holiday Inn

room.” They managed to reach Hinesville

without being stopped, bringing their daily
distance to a very long 146.6 miles.

Sunday -- After Saturday’s journey,
Clugston and Matthews decided to sleep
late and hit the road at around 9:15. A
missed short cut, a strong head wind, and
aching legs and hands made for slow going.
Luckily, the roads were extremely flat.
After traveling 94.26 miles, the two

Refuge Campsite and spent the night in
tents they had rented from Davidson Out-
doors.

Monday -- On the final day of their
journey, Clugston and Matthews were on
the road by 8 A.M. After crossing the
Florida border, they traveled over some of
the worstroads they had encoutered on their
trip. They ate lunch in Maccleny, then
continued on to Gainesville, their final
destination. The last stretch covered 98
miles.

It was definitely amemorable 500 miles.
In retrospect, Clugston and Matthews said
ni wou advise others to undergo more

ining and to make specific plans in
advance for overnight stops. They also
recommended a third person to lighten the
load and for “safety in numbers” purposes. :

Why did they spend five days of their
Thanksgiving break involved in such
physical exertion when they could have
been enjoying the relaxation and comforts
of home? For Clugston and Matthews, fol-
lowing through on an idea and seeing it
become areality offered sufficient satisfac-
tion.

Matthews summed up the accomplish-
ment in simple terms: “We wanted to do it,
and we did it.”

What to do with Meleagris Gallopava: ? What else? Soup!

one day Americans will boil

By BILL SCOUTEN .
_ Welcome back! Doesn’t it
feel great to be back...really!? I
don’t know about you, but I
certainly am notin the studying

mood. In fact, I don’t even:

want to think about books,
school, or studying at all!
Certainly this time, the three
weeks between Thanksgiving
break and Christmas break,

' must be.a most relevant spoof,

bar none. The spoof, however,
concentrates not on these so
called “party” weeks, but on the
plight of the turkey in modem
America.

- Meleagris Gallopava,
known colloquially as Tom, is
the wild turkey which Ameri-
cans eat so much of during the
holiday season. Although once
numerous in America’s wood-
lands, wild turkeys have been

reduced in number. Thus, the

efficient and cheap growth of

Turkeys in large flocks has
enabled Tom to remain at the
forefront of the holiday fare.

_ Think back to your Thanks-
giving or Christmas of last

year. Remember Mom or

Grandes seis up at the
ungodly hour of 7:00 a.m. on
the festive day? Stuffing,
gravy, peas, cranberry sauce,

perhaps sweet potato pudding,
plum pudding, or pie was to be

- prepared that day. The aroma

of this feast would surely make
the mouth water.

But what of the turkey? What
about Tom? Poor guy! After
being poked, pushed, punc-
tured, plucked, basted, and
baked, the old turkey is cut,
carved, clipped, and meted out
to the partakers of the feast.
And after Tom is attacked and
brutally abused, he is left to lie

-about == a skeleton with bits of

skin and stringy pieces of sinew
hanging lifelessly.

What is there to do with
Tom? What else? Soup.

‘More food for more festivi-
ties -- the inter-holiday fast.
It’s a rather new concept, I'll
concede, but the principles
behind it are quite ane.
“Gluttony sort of goes with
end-of-the-year holidays -- the
more fortunate among us have
developed a Yule tradition of

stuffing ourselves with food,
fellowship and fun (let’s leave

- Shopping out of this, shall

we?)” The solution to the ir-
resolute stomach is quite ele-
mentary -- eat soup.

‘You may be asking yourself

what Tom, turkey, the holiday. -

season, or soup has to do with
the “Spoof” article at Davidson
College. (I know I am asking
myself that question right now
1#@$%)

The logic, the method to the
madness just presented, is quite
lucid, though. The paralellism
is quite bold. Tom, the soup
turkey, is suffering the plight of
the American society . . . its
binges and fasts, iruerest and
disinterest, its celebration and
commercialism. I knew there
was a parallel!

Tom, the tortured turkey, is a
victim of the holiday season.
He suffers from America’s pre-
occupation with business as
usual.

Rather, the appetite of the
