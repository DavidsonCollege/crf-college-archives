Bevan Talks At Phi Beta Kappa Meeting,
Says Students’ Preference Must Be Heard

Noting: the convergence
of student concerns and the
concerns of America’s most

depressed social groups,
newly’ appointed Academic
Vice - President John M.

Bevan said Wednesday that
it is time student  prefer-
ences were heard.

Speaking to Phi Beta Kap-
pa initiates and members of
the college community, aca-
demic vice president-elect
Bevan said that before stu-
dents can be heard it is
vital to Know their most
basic concerns.

Bevan outlined the student
situation as he saw

it and

attempted to show how they
presented an unprecedented
challenge to American edu-
cation.

The student scene, Bevan

said, is characterized by a
sense of ‘overwhelming con-
cern, '

Evidences of this feeling

banization, cybernetics, rac-
ism and armaments.

Unfortunately these con-
cerns have trapped students
in conflicts with the ultimate
powers in colleges and univer-
sities,

“The student was lead to
believe,” Bevan said, ‘‘that
learning in college would be
exciting, but he finds he has
to look for excitement in per-
ipheral activities.”

The student finds little in-
quiry, purpose and commun-
ity in higher education.

He is trapped between
dogma and skepticism , and
finds that he gets his degree
if he learns to play the prop-
er tune. The college does
not give him a chance to
develop a philosophy of life.

The problem of the student
is that he has learned. that
if he tries to change condi-
tions through proper chan-
nels his words are drowned
out by bigger and better
machines.” He fas learned,

The new purpose of the
student, Bevan said, is to
Strengthen the university.
The job of the community of
education is to heed that
purpose.

Bevan went on to outline
some of the most important
changes suggested by stu-
dents. First they demand a
revitalized educational pro-
gram including interdisciplin-
ary value dialogue.

If universities and colleges
are truth seeking institutions,
it is important to consider
what truths and values should
be sought.
It is the

concern of stu-
dents, Bevan stated, that
human _ relationships, prob
lems and destiny be actively
pursued in the course of ed-
ucation,

Students have found that ex-
isting course structures are
too restrictive for this quest
and are asking for reformu
lations of academic structure.

Second Bevan said students
see programs in community

involvement’ as part of any
academic revitalization.

Students think that they

about problems rather than
ignore “them. They want

guidance to help

“For instance, when John
Kennedy was killed, the peo-
ple turned to the church; the
same was true after the death
of Martin Luther King.”

Following this analogy,
Williams brought up the con-
cept of the American myth
of rational faith. He started
with. drawing out historical
perspective for the Ameri-
can myth.

“New England is the cen-

Plott. feels that finances is
the greatest problem that
confronts the Artist Series.

“We operate on a budget
of approximately $6000,” he
said. This figure is camposed
of $4.75 out of each student’s
fees, $1000 out of the, regu-
lar college budget (which
roughly covers the operation-
al expense) and the rest
from ticket sales.

“This,” Plott Said, ‘limits
our selection of performers
somewhat. The trend for Ar-
tist Series is now toward
larger groups of performers
instead of. individuals with
the possible exception of
guitarists. This tends to
make theprices even high-
er.”

Plott feels that the upcom-
ing campus radio station can

play a_ significant role in
generating student interest
in the Artist Series to the

level it ought to be.

As far as the next year is
concerned, several programs
are close to being formally

contracted. At this time
specific details are not avail
able, but several possibilities
include an ethnic troupe of
dancers, singers, and music-
ians; 4 baritone soloist,” and

an unusual theatrical group.

“As America further de-
veloped, the church accepted
the role of dealing with the
private faith of the Ameri
can people.

“For this reason, American
churches became individual-
istic and pluralistic. Because
the unity of the church was
not necessary for the unity of
the nation, the churches split
into multifarious different
factions.”

Williams noted that the
nation continued to interpret
the destiny of the nation
along religious lines. ‘

He ‘continued, ‘‘The church
worked with the — private
faith of the people, and the
church and the nation de-
veloped the public faith of
ihe people.

“America does not have a
national church, but it does
have a national religion, with
documents such as the Con-
sutition at the center.”
