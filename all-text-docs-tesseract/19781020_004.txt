From the Editor

In search of opinion |

Last Monday I realized that I
-was a bureaucrat.

Though I commanded my
staff to ‘‘get out there and find
out what's going on,” I myself
was content to remain in the
confines of my quiet Union

office working on. this special

project, .otganizing that little —

detail. I was a busy bureaucrat,
mind: you, for-there are count-
less projects to be undertaken
and details to be organized at
The Davidsonian. But a busy
bureaucrat is still a bureaucrat.

Enough of this, I resolved,
stepping from my massive desk
and exiting the isolated sanctu-
ary of the office in search of
opinion. Your opinion.

I slipped into the seat next to
the professor as the buzzer
sounded to begin class. Our
instructor, new to Davidson,
addressed-the class: ‘‘Tell me,
' have most of.the articles in the
newspaper ‘(The Davidsonian)
about WDAV been basically
true?’’ Several students shifted
uncomfortably in their seats,
one murmured something about
the editor being in the class,
then one student bravely volun-
teered a qualified semi-approval
of the articles in The Davidso-
nian.

Said the prafessor, ‘‘Well, I
just talked to an older professor
who said he. didn’t understand
why the students were so upset;
he said it was clear to everyone
from the beginning that WDAV
would be primarily classical.’’

‘“‘That’s bullshit’ slipped in-
voluntarily from the mouth
next to the professor—my
mouth. A brief hush, until
several agreed that the older
professor’s statement was. in-
deed what I had labeled it.
Before turning to the. lecture,
the class discussed the WDAV
matter. |Most seemed interes-

ted, a couple asked questions of —

Not since spring 1977, when
Davidson attracted national at-
tention by hiring and firing a
Jewish professor, could I recall
a classful of students discussing
a campus issue.

In 1977 we boycotted Convo-
_ cation in protest of the Coliege’s
action. What, if anything, will
happen this time, I wondered.

Spencer’s first decade at David-
son. She said she’d heard that
Sig Ep President Rick Kelly.
was going to write a letter to the
editor that “really burned —
Davidsonian.

President Kelly's letter i is on
the” opposite page. Take a

moment to read it. It is a .
-well-considered, carefully-writ-
“ten piece, and—I hope Kelly

isn’t disappointed—I don’t
think it ‘‘burns” The Davidso-
nian at all.

- The paragraph Kelly ques-
tions read: ‘‘Today, Sig Eps
still talk with bitterness about
the way Spencer is said to have
handled: the matter (of self-se-
lection).”” There’s. no sense in—
arguing my interpretation of
that letter vs. Kelly’s. Though
President Kelly insists that the
fraternity’s -official position is
that it deeply respects Dr.
Spencer, I believe I can find at
least one and probably more Sig
Eps who harbor ill will against
Spencer over the. self-selection
battle. But that’s trivial nit-
picking, and it misses the point
I want to make.

Kelly’s letter may take a
swipe at The Davidsonian, but
in large part it pleads a different
case. The letter seeks to dispel a
stereotype that has haunted the |
Sig. Eps’ for years—that the

- fraternity is a rowdy crowd of

off-campus isolationists who
can’t and don’t want to get
along with anybody on campus.
Kelly attacks that stereotype
vigorously, and, I think, con-
vincingly.

Kelly’s letter makes a specific
complaint, keeps The Davidso-
nain on its toes, and goes on to
add new information, a fresh
perspective. In my sleep I
dream that all letters to the
editor will be thus.

But we all have to put up
with nightmares. Rob Field’s:
letter is a nightmare.

Student points to
‘narrowing Scope’

To the Editor:

In the past few weeks I have
noticed a trend in The David-
sonian which causes me some
concern. The newspaper has
continually narrowed its scope
with each successive issue of
this term.

The articles which are pub-
lished increasing]. deal only
with the on-going ‘‘conversa-
tion’”’ between students and the
administration to the exclusion
of much newsworthy material.

Last week’s issue (October
16, 1978) illustrates clearly the
narrowing scope of the paper.
Until one reaches the sports
section, one cannot clearly con-
clude that more than a handful
of students and faculty remains
on campus. The articles and

editorials of the rest of this

issue deal overwhelmingly with
the administration and the trus-
tees in their relationship or
non-relationship with the stu-
dents and with non-campus
oriented issues such as low-rent

of the first floor of Chambers
and the Union are overlooked or
at most (two sentences on the
Mean Green/Wildcat Scene)
barely mentioned.

The newspaper is not serving
its proper function of being an
informative media when it fails
to report all newsworthy events
and thoughts—even those
which are not spectacular or
sensational. In addition the
student elected editor of the
newspaper is not fully fulfilling
his responsibility to the student
body, allowing the scope of The
Davidsonian to be narrowed in
this manner.

I sincerely hope that this
unhealthy trend can be re-
versed. With this reversal The

Davidsonian can once again»

serve as an active media in
informing the student body
and faculty of goings-on at all
levels—international, national,
community, campus, as well as
administrative.
