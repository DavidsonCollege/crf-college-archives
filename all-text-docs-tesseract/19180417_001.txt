store.

Dr. Martin in a recent letter to the
Government asked their advice concern-
ing this matter. As vet he has received
no reply. Consequently, this college.
with the other colleges of the country,
will take no further action unless new
conditions arise that would warrant such
a course. :

Last year “Phe Farmer Boys” were
permitted to leave college to farm  be-
cause our country had just declared war
and was in a state of turmuail and ex-
citement, but now that conditions have
become more normal and business has
seitled down to its usual routine, the
faculty does not deem it worth while to
break into the college term by permitting
a part of the student body to go home
before examinations.

LAST CHANCS FOR WOULD-BE
MAGAZINE CONTRIBUTORS

Despite the fact that the Fresh-Soph
issue of the Magazine has not as yet
come from the. press. preparations are
under way for the last, and what the
staff hopes will be the best issue. Some
material has been left over from the pre-
ceding issue eminating from the pens of
ambitious Freshmen and Sophomores.
and to this there are being added one or
two articles of more merit by the upper
classmen. The editor is contemplating
having a Collection of Student Poetry
grace the last issue if there is enough
forthcoming, and hence it is to the poets.
near-poets, and free verse writers that he
would now appeal.

On the outskirts of one of our pros-
perous Southern towns (of about 5.000
population) there stands a store bearing
this inscription, ‘Your Last Chance.”
Without enroaching on the trade-mark
of this worthy mercantile enterprise, the
editor would call to the attention of
those kind and well meaning voung gen-
tlemen who all the vear have ‘intended to
“work up something for the Magazine,”
that the next issue is their last chance.

Tt will be necessary that all material
be in by May 1.

DAVIDSON TRACK TEAM TO
MEET SOUTHERN COLLEGES

Manager Grev has just completed ar-
rangements with Georgia Tech for a
track meet in Atlanta on Saturday, April
20. This is to be a grand meet of col-
leges and universities in Georgia, Ala-
bama. and Mississippi. a half dozen
schools participating: That this will be
a really big meet is evident from the fact
that track is a far more popular branch
of athletics in these schools than in the
Carolinas.

The team leaves on Friday night, and
will be composed of Grey, Crouch, Fin-
ley. Brand and McQueen. Here's hop-
ing they bring off the honors for old

hours of unremitting toil spent in prepar-

Priday evening when Davidson's repre-
sentatives will nobly uphald the worthy
debating reputation pained in years past.
Davidson's spacious and beautiful forum,
Shearer Hall, will, no doubt, resound
with wonderful oratory and the rafters
will re-echo with the clash of arguments.

Vhe question of the railroads is an old
one, and vet, because it has been brought
to our attention very forcibly within re-
cent months, we are vitally interested in
the railroads as a necessary part of our
national life. Our well being as a pro-
gressive mation, in peace and in war, is
to a very large extent dependent upon
our common carriers.

Our other debating team defeated
Lakavette College in Greensboro on
March 22. With such a record, and
with such an interesting question for dis-
cussion, it is hoped that a very large at-
tendance will be present to hear the de-
bate.
