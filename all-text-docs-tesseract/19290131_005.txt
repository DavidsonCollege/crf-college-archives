WILDCATS VERSUS V. P. IL --- SATURDAY NIGHT

CAT TRAX
As They Follow the Red and
Black
By Zeb V. Long, Jr.
+- ann

Lenoir-Rhyne’s Mountain Bears
brought a hard playing quintet
over Monday night, and they gave
the local ball flingers quite a hand-
ful of action for the entire evening.
39-26 was a safe margin though.
We want to see a few more double-
deckers rolling into the hoops
when the Cats hit State, Duke, and
Wake Forest. We'll probably need

‘em.

Tonight Monk and his merry men
again invade the Queen City of Char-
lotte for a little fracas. The last time
over there the Cats bowed to Captain
Rufus Hackney and his Tar Heels from
Carolina. And in the clash tonight
with Charlotte Monograms the Cats
are likely to bow again unless they
watch their step. The Monograms
have a speedy, sharp shooting aggre-
gation. They have cleaned up pretty
well around these diggings, and will be
out to tame the Wildcats. There is a
special cause for vengeance, because
last year the Jungaleers pulled a big
surprise party to lick the Charlotte
lads.

Then Saturday night Davidson
will play host to a V. P. I. team for
the first time in several years.
fact, unless we are off in our cal-
culations, it was back in 1922 that
the last-crew from Virginia Poly
stepped onto this fair campus. That
was the time our own Monk
Younger brought his South At-
lantic Grid Champions down and
saw a fighting Wildcat team tie
them at seven all.

We look for the Cats to sail right
on through for a win over the Tech-
nicians. Elon put it on them
good margin a week or so ago.

It’s great news to hear that the
varsity trackmen are entering big
indoor meet at University of Vir-
ginia about the last of February.
There are several men on Captain
Pritchett’s ledger who will make
some noise at the coming meet, and
besides it will be invaluable train-
ing for the outdoor meets later in
the spring.

Every day sees Tex Tilson shoving
it to his footballers little harder,
and before:so many’ more moons have
passed away there will be the regular
Saturday afternon practice games.
That football team is going to be right
in there next fall and we're putting
our money on ’em now.

Looks Ike Old Georga Tech has
raked out a few good courtment as
well as gridiron heroes this year.
So far, the Ramblin’ Wrecks are
showing the way to all their Sou-
thern Conference rivals. Some-
body better step in before it is too
late. We are getting worried about
those eccentric Tar Heels. There
was nothing slouchy about the way
they romped on Tebell’s Red Ter-
rors from State. Can they cop the
Southern Title again? Don’t think
for a minute they haven’t a chance
to do that very thing.

The Charlotte Observer is up to. its
old tricks of consigning Davidson to
the cellar. “The Davidson Wildcats
have plenty of fight but at present ap-
pear to be no match for State, Caro-
lina or Duke,” says the Observer. Well,
we still say “there will come a time.”
Some of these nights, the Cats are go-
ing to get right to a man, and then
somebody is going to get upset.

Seems to us that this new “Y”
basketball team is going to fill a
need on the campus and furnish
more real action to boot. There is
a good prospect for games with all
leading “Y” teams hereabouts, and
there is good material out to cope
with the best of them. Everybody
in behind the “Y” cats and give
them the boost they deserve.

A rally by Elon n the final minutes of
the game with Davidson here tonight fell
short and the Cats won, 41 to 35, in a
fast cage battle.

Davidson held marked advantage
through the first half, leading 26 to 16
at the intermission, but during the second
period the Elon cagers speeded up the
play. Davidson had run the score up to
40 to 28 with only a few minutes to play
when Elon spurted to count seven while
the Cats only scored once.
