WITH OUR ALUMNI.

TO THE MEN OF 1913.

Three years ago we men of 1913
terminated what had been the happiest
period of our lives. It is a source of
satisfaction and great pleasure to know
that with this conclusion of our joyous
college days, altho we were soon sep-
arated from that blessed companionship

of the past four years, those bonds of

friendship which had been so pleasantly
made and carefully nurtured were to
continue forever. Let us unite again
this coming commencement season, to re-
view and renew, old acquaintances, ideas
and ideals, formed and developed at
old D.C.

Prof. Jno. L. Douglas. on whom the
responsibility of many such occasions has
devolved, has asked that T share with
him in this big undertaking, and begin
to lay plans for a reunion of our class,
the class of 1913. The success of any
reunion depends entirely on getting to-
gether those who are expected to unite.
and it is to this end that the columns of
THe Davipsonian have been so kindly
tendered, and shall be used in the re-
maining issues,

This is not’ going to be my reunion,
but T hope one of the class of 1913, and
you men who were ever to the call of
the “green and white” and achieved suc-
cess under the motto of “Labor Vincit
Omnia,” are requested and urged not
only to. be there yourselves, but also to
bring some other member with you.
Watch these columns for further an-
nouncements,

ing Hobson, of Cornelius, on the struc-

their share in developing and keeping
one healthy in bodv and mind.

The first part of the lecture was taken
up with an illustration of the structure

lowed by an outline of the service that
the teeth render taward keeping a person
in good health and at his best. “The talk

LECTURF. LAST WEFK.

An illustrated lecture on the “astern
Forest Reserve” was given in Shearer
Hall on last Thursday night by Mr. W
S. Hall. who is District Forester for th:
Appalachian Mountain section. “The
lecture was mainly on the work of the
government in preserving and caring for
the forests in this section.

Three reasons were given showing the
necessity for the preservation of the for-
ests; first. that forests hold the soil to-
gether and prevent erosion; second, that
the timber is valuable and will be need-
ed; and third, that these mountain for-
est tracts make good summer resorts.
Each of these voints was illustrated with
pictures showing the utility of the forest
areas and actual conditions in them were
portraved. A number of pictures were
also shown outlining the work that the
government is doing both in making
trails thru the forests and in the preven-
tion of forest fires.
