mately twenty-five students have
manifested interest in the organiza-
tion by attending its first two post-

war mectings.
McAlister President

A meeting was held on Tuesday,
February 26, for the purpose of re-
organizing the club, electing officers,
and laying plans for the semester's
activities. At that time Johnny Mc-
Alister was elected president, Leigh-
McKeithen
program chairman, and C. W. Scott
secretary. It was decided that the
club would mett on Tuesday, March
5, for its first program, and that
would be held
month thereafter.

Discuss UNO Charter

The topic under discussion last
Tuesday was the United Nations
Charter. Dr. Johnston prefaced the
open discussion with a talk on this
subject, with*the view in mind of
better acquainting those who had

ton vice-president and.

mectings twice a

not read the charter in its entirety
with its contents.

The purpose of the International
Relations Club is to give students
who are interested in current world
affairs an opportunity to share each
other's views and to keep informed
on international events. The general
plan of meetings is to have a de-
signated leader discuss the chosen
topic for twenty or thirty minutes,
and then to throw the floor open
to general discussion of the subject
at hand.

Members of the club are looking
forward to a very successful and
profitable semester, since there are
sO many matters of great inter-
national importance taking place at
this time. They hope to discuss in
the future such matters as the Bret-
ton Woods Agreement, Russo-Bri-
tish differences in Indonesia and
Greece, and the UNO meetings in
London.

Membership Open

This organization was formerly
operated under the bidding system,
but membership in it is now open to
all men who are interested. It is
believed that this method will en-
able the club to return more quickly
to its normal size,,and at the rame
time it will guarantee the organiza-

tion a group of men who are ac-
tively interested in current affairs.

Rifle Team
Wins Honors

It has been announced by Fourth

loping rifle team, coached by vete-
ran T/Set. B. R. Burton of the col-
lege KOTC, captured fourth place
honors in a ficld of sixteen clubs

competing for the annual

Trophy award.

Davidson's five top men, all fresh-
men, plugged out a score of 836,
trailing only N. C. State's 900 and
Georgia Tech's two team scores of
871 and 8148, while the Citadel and
Clemson came in for a close fifth
and sixth with 828 and 825. Taking
high score honors for the Wildcats
aggregation was Sam D. McDaniel
of Atlanta with 178 points, only &
below the highest individual score
of the entire competition.

Following McDaniel were Charles
M. Coffey of North Wilkesboro
with 175, Flynn V. Long of Austin,
Texas with 168, Walter P. Walker
of Collierville, Tenn. with 158, and
P. P. Deaton of Statesville with
157,

Sgt. Burton, whose prowess as a
rifle coach is a byword at Davidson,
was reasonably pleased with the
showing of his young team, and
states that the material now avail-
able should develop into a first-
class club by next season, Accord-
ing to Lt. Col. Howard B. Arbuckle,

mandant of the ROTC, negotiations

Recognized as a varsity team by
the campus athletic association in
1942, the Wildcat sharpshooters fired
a near-perfect season, defeating
Clemson, Wofford, N, C. State, and
the Naval ROTC’s at both U.N.C.
and U.S.C. and losing only to The
Citadel. During the next year, the
last season before the war closed

went on to win the Hearst Trophy
hands down.

Plans For Gym Are Complete;
Architect Sought For Church

President John R. Cunningham
reported to the Board of Trustees
on February 20, that though uncer-
taintics in the ficlds of labor and
materials make the exact date inde-
terminate, erection of the new gym-
nasium and church at Davidson Col-
lege will begin as soon as conditions
permit.
Dr.

iinal plans for the gymnasium were

Cunningham explained that

in the hands of the contractor for
the study of the possibility of secur-
ing materials, and that the college
was now considering sc¥eral out-
standing men in the colonial archi-
tecture field in connection with the
church building.

The gymnasium will face Richard-
son Field from the North end with
the swimming pool on the cast side
and the varsity tennis courts just to
the rear of the main building.

Designed by H. R. Weeks, the
architect who designed the Woolen
Gymnasium at the University of
North Carolina, the Davidson gym
will include a main floor which can
be converted into three _ practice
basketball courts, accordion type
bleachers, an auxiliary gymnasium,
a 75 foot pool, and other features
which will make it one of the most
modern and ‘best equipped buildings
of its type in the South.

There scem to be two schools of
thought on the location of ‘the

building on the south corner of the
front campus facing north and: re-
storing the old original quadrangle.
Another idea is that if the church
is placed on the front of the cam-
pus, it will obstruct the view ofthe
Chambers Building and should
therefore have some other !ovation.
At any rate, the location of, the
church has not yet been determined.

Funds for the new gym and col-
lege church were appropriated last
year by the college officials. Every-
one is looking forward to the large
swimming pool which will be located
in the basement of the gym: This
will certainly complete one of the
greatest needs of the campus ever
since it opened it doors to students.
The gym will carry a number of

volley ball courts,. The new church

Final Concert

Of Year Heard

Miss Sari Biro, Pianist, Gives
Excellent Performance
By Charles Hadley

Last week many students heard
season
Miss
Sari Biro. Miss Biro was also heard
last she

the final concert of the

given by the noted pianist,

in Chapel week, where
gave a rendition of a number of
scenes from “Pictures At An Ex-
hibition”. Her performance Monday
night was attended by a large num-
ber of musical interested people,
from all sections of the state around
Davidson. Following the chapel ex-
ercise I was very fortunate in seeing
Miss Biro for a few minutes at the
ey",

I had been waiting at the “Y”
for only a few minutes to interview
Miss Biro when she came walking
in so softly that I didn’t even sce
her. I introduced myself to her, and
before I could state my business,
she had led me over to the piano
thinking that 1 had come to play for
her.

“Now”, she said, “play anything
you like.”

“But Miss Biro,” 1 said, “I've only
come to interview you for our school
paper.”

She apulogized quickly, and we
began talking. Her quiet, demure
manner caught my attention from
the start, and I found that she
wasn't at all hard to talk to — in
fact, she seemed bubbling over with
things she wanted to tell someone.

Miss Biro told me that Davidson
is the first boy's college exclusively
that she has ever performed before,
and that it is truly one of the most
beautiful ones that she has ever
seen.

“I wonder.if the boys realize what
a wonderful opportunity it is to have
a place of education like this,” she
said. “I don't suppose ‘they will
appreciate it fully until they get a
little older.”

Miss Biro told me that she thinks
our auditorium is superb, and that
our library is very, very- striking.
“I think it is even better than the
library of Congress,” she said. “I
wish that I could just sit down in
there and spend the day reading
and reading.”

I laughed a little strangely, think-
ing of the hours I've spent in there
reading and reading.

I found that Miss Biro has studied
music for about twelve or thirteen
years in all. She has travelled all
over Europe and the ©, S, with her
concerts.

“Muise is my religion,” she said in
her quict manner. “A person who
really loves and appreciates good
music cannot be bad. And one
doesn’t have to be a concert artist
to really take part in it and enjoy it.
I do not do it only for making
money, but for enjoyment.”

Miss Biro told me that she is
Hungarian-born, but added quickly
and proudly that now she is an
American citizen. She said that it
took her three trying weeks to get
her citizenship papers. She said
that she doesn't think that Ameri-
cans realize how fortunate they are
to be Americans because they have
never known anything else but their
kind of life.

I asked Miss Biro which she likes
better, Europe or the United States.
- Quietly and earnestly she said,
“You are an Ameriéan by birth; I

am an American by choice.”
