FOR THE SAKE OF ART

Reicheck and Kardestuncer on display in VAC

By WILL RAGLAND
Staff Writer

Last week the Visual Arts Cen-
ter opened two new exhibitions in
the William H. Van Every, Jr. and
Edward M. Smith Galleries, show-
casing the work of Elaine Reichek
and Sermin Kardestuncer. This
past Thursday evening, a public
lecture was given by Reichek in
the Seamans Lecture Auditorium
on her exhibition Elaine Reichek:
Guests of a Nation on display in

the Van Every Gallery. Sermin
Kardestuncer’s exhibition is en-
titled Sermin Kardestuncer: Con-
suming Time and can be found in
the Smith Gallery.

Elaine Reichek’s work in-

volves a series on Irish culture,,.

Elaine Reichek: Guests of a Na-
tion, in which she uses photo-
graphs, fabrics, knitting, and em-
broidery to convey different mes-
sages through her art. Much of her
work focuses on the visual image,
represented by collected photo-
graphs and knitted objects. An

underlying theme that Reichek’s
emphasizes is the problem of iden-
tity and how identity is portrayed
and often created through visual
images.

Three of her works in particu-
lar involve enlarged photographs
of scenes claiming to be accurate
representations of the Irish cul-
ture: a touristy scene of men carry-
ing a large boat on their shoulders,
a “documentary” photo of the Pro-
visional gunmen, and a thatched
cottage. In each piece, Reichek
presents the enlarged photograph

and a knitted wool reproduction of
it. She reveals the staged nature of
the photographic images and how
they develop into icons, in this
case of the Irish culture. We are
manipulated by them in-that they
reinforce our fabrications.

Her approach involving jux-
taposition and alteration gives an
experience to the viewer that is
eye-opening. She gives us escape
from the images and a new way of
seeing things. We are free to re-
spond to the images in out own

way.

Elaine Reichek is known for
dealing with issues of cultural iden-
tity, having placed focus in her art
on Jewish Americans, Native
Americans, and South Americans.
She is based in New York and has
exhibited her work both nationally
and internationally. Herselection
on display in the Van Every Gal-
lery was exhibited’ at the Irish
Museum of Modern Art in Dublin

Supermodel NIGHTMARES

Marilyn Manson leaves stage early; crowd not pleased

Iam so All-American, I'd sell
you suicide/I am totalitarian, I’ve
got abortions in my éyes/I hate the
hater, I rape the raper/ I am the
animal who will not be himself.
These words raged forth from Rev.
Manson’s mouth furiously as hun-
dreds of purple (or pink, or green,
or evenred) haired people moshed,
yelled, and jumped only tow feet
below the stage, singing along to
the “Irresponsible Hate Anthem.”
Marilyn and Co., known collec-
tively as the group Marilyn
Manson, played at Charlotte’s
Grady Cole Center on November
10. They are currently on tour

“promoting their latest LP, Anti-
christ Superstar (presently no. 3
on the Billboard charts), along with
selections from their previous two
albums, Smells Like Children (EP)

and Portrait of an American Fam-.

ily. Mr. Manson, decked out in full
face-paint, proudly displayed his
many tattoos and scars tothe crowd,

who were ready to rock after a
disappointing opening act (NY
Loose). After a variety of songs,
including the MTV favorite “Sweet
Dreams,” the concert came to an
abrupt end and everyone inside
was forced to leave only 45 min-
utes after the head liners took the
stage. According to the latest issue
of Creative Loafing, someone had
precariously thrown a beer bottle
during one of the songs and injured
one of the band members. Many
fans left the building bewildered
and questioning the early depar-
ture of the group (although drugs
and alcohol probably contributed
to the fans’ loss of faculties). Ob-
viously, Manson’s set was unex-
pectedly cut short and many fans
disappointed.

Marilyn Manson, originally
from Ft. Lauderdale, began in 1989
as Marilyn Manson and the Spooky
Kids. Their current members each
possess the first name of a female
pop culture icon and the last name
of a serial killer (Marilyn Manson,
Ginger Fish, Madonna Wayne
Gacy, Twiggy Ramirez, and Zim

Zum). Rev. Manson named him-
self that way as a statement on
society’s interests and the deprav-
ity of individual freedom among
the young people today. Since
signing on the Nothing records,
Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails
fame) has exclusively produced
Manson’s lasttwo albums, and with
the departure of member Daisy
Berkowitz, Reznor played lead
guitar on three songs on Antichrist
and designed the music for two
others. This association with Nine
Inch Nails has cannonballed
Marilyn Manson into the public
eye, including appearances on
Donahue and three videos on MTV.
With lyrics that proclaim, “I am
the god of f**k,” and shirts that
read “Kill your parents, Kill god,
Kill yourself,” it’s hard to imagine
such a group so ingrained in the
music scene today. Even with this
propaganda and a recent appoint-
ment as a Reverend in the Church
of Satan, Mr. Manson admits in the
August 1996 issue of Spin, “I don’t
necessarily believe in the devil;

_it’s just that using that word ‘Sa-

Marilyn Manson in the morning.

Marilyn Manson

tan’ is the ultimate act of rebel-
lion.” And that is what Marilyn
Manson builds their music on the
stronghold that the band members
feel people lack today. Their mu-

sic about rebellion. As of yet, no .
plans have been made for after the
tour, although rumors persist of
Mr. Manson’s possible suicide in
the near future.
