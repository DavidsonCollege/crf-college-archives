On the rise of land between Jackson
Court and the Martin Science Buil-
ding, there is a circle of red brick,
perhaps 25 feet in diameter. Some
have speculated that this empty brick
terrace is a launching pad...when it’s
not obscured by leaves.

In reality, the circle is, or at least is
a part of, last year’s senior class gift
to the college. Despite the wide range
of campus jokes descrying the very
idea, class president Martin \Eakes
and the other members of the gift
selection committee sincerely meant it
as an outdoor classroom.

The classroom was originally de-
signed to include the existing circle,
13 benches, and 11 tables. But
problems have plagued the project
from the beginning according to
Director of*the Living Endowment,
Tom Bernhardt. Bernhardt is the one
administration figure who works most
closely with seniors in selecting their
gift.

When the class originally voted to
pursue the idea, their cost projections
were grossly underestimated. They
had raised $1753, which is about as
much as any class can hope to raise in
Bernhardt’s estimation. They went
ahead and had the terrace constructed
last spring on that cost appraisal.

But as it came time to purchase the
remainder of the materials, they
found that, with the approximately
$900 left over, they could only afford
three benches and no tables.

The seniors thought that those
benches, priced at $250 apiece, were
of low quality and would have made

the whole outdoor classroom a cam-
pus eyesore. They were ‘‘white and
powdery and not very nice to sit on,”
according to Bernhardt.

Nothing further was done. With the
graduation of the class, the money
and responsibility for the project

passed directly to Bernhardt’s office.”

“We've finally contracted with a

fellow from the F. Graham Williams_

Company to make us eight benches
like the 1926 benches in frant of
Chambers, only these won’t have the
class year inscribed on the top,” he
said.

‘“The benches have been ordered
and should be in sometime this
spring. There was no money for the
tables, and, besides, there are appar-
ently no suitable concrete tables on
the market. You can’t go down to a
concrete place in Charlotte and see a
table for sale,’’ Bernhardt added.

There are no plans at present to
ever complete the project the way it
had originally been designed. ‘‘But if
it is something really used by

, Students then the college might take
it upon itself to complete it, to buy
the tables and all. If we have any
money left over when we get in the
benches that have already been
ordered, then we'll send off for
another bench. All the money will be
spent,” he said.

There is still a lot of uncertainty
about who will use the classroom once
the benches are set up, or whether it
will really be used at all. Bernhardt
projects that it will be a good place for
classes, seminars, theatre and drama
groups, but mostly individual stu-
dents to go. If just a few people use it
that’s okay.”

IS DAVIDSON the Stonehenge of the South?

‘Many merchants who accept cre-
dit cards pay a percentage fee to the
credit card companies for rights to the
privilege,” Hedrick explained.

“The merchant passes this cost on
to the customer. The end result:
customers who pay in cash subsidize
the credit card companies.

‘‘We want the cash customer to
receive a discount.

“Sabra is contacting local leaders
and businessmen to enlist their
support for the idea. We hope to
publish a guide of businesses that
support cash discounting.

‘‘In connection with the Prison
Reform Project, we will be hosting
Jessica Mitford, author of Kind and
Usual Punishment: The Prison Busi-
ness. Mitford will be on campus
March 23 and 24.

‘‘On April 24 and 25 a founder of
the Fortune Society, David Rothen-
berg, will be speaking on campus. The
Fortune Society publicizes the con-
ditions in the prison system and helps

ex-convicts become full and capable
citizens.”

Hedrick plans to initiate a drive to
get more students involved in PIRG.

“We are scheduling an open meet:
ing Monday the 14th at 7 pm to
discuss how to increase student input,
and we welcome people and any of
their suggestions.

“In the past, we’ve had a faculty
advisory committee. We hope to
reactivate it so we can get the
faculty’s ideas on what PIRG should
be doing.

‘*For those who are interested in
working with PIRG, we are choosing
a new board this month. About half
the ten positions on the board will be
vacated by graduation.

“Elections, if they are necessary,
will be held March 22,” said Hedrick.

The next PIRG national conference
will be in Washington, D.C., during
June.

‘‘Chances are good that we will
have Jimmy Carter as our keynote
speaker.

would have about 72, the same
number as this year. She is
strongly opposed to increasing
membership beyond that
number.

“The Court is far too crow-
ded now. If the school plans to
retain the small-group eating
concept, it must provide more
room.

‘‘We need two more hou-
ses,” she said.

About fifty signed up to eat
at the new women’s house,
and representative Angie
Wright believes that member-
ship will be at about 60 after
fall term next year ‘‘when
people see how the house is
going.”

Representatives from PDT
and SAE houses were not
available for comment.

Dean of Students Will Terry
felt that self-selection ‘‘went
smoothly this year’ and spec-
ulated that ‘“‘next year should
be even more smoother’”’ since

the incoming freshman class
will be considerably smaller in
fall 1977.

This example explains the
decision on the waiting list
technicality: a freshman is on
waiting lists at Houses A and
B, but really wants to eat at
A. House B offers the fresh-
man a spot, but he refuses,

waiting out for House A. Does
the freshman lose his ranking
on House B’s list?

The Council decided that he
does not—he retains his rela-
tive position on the House B
list and unless and until House
A offers him a spot, he must
be contacted again if another
spot opens up at House B.

“‘A central dining service for
freshmen and others who
choose to eat with Slater
would allow for greater effi-
ciency in food production and
distribution.

“‘It would also ease over-
crowding on Patterson Court,
for Richards and Bailey Hou-
ses could be converted to
eating clubs.

beneficial to the community,
so the languages would have
been.”

The Council indicated that
its rejection of the language
houses pertained only to the
school year 1977-78 and en-
couraged a later submission of

the proposal when the housing
shortage problem is _ less
serious.

Rabil, however, is not opti-
mistic. ‘‘After this Council’s
vote, I doubt that a proposal
for language houses will pass
any time soon,” he concluded.

“I would hope the building
would be designed as a multi-
purpose facility, and that it
could be built to allow for
expansion in the future if the
need arises.”

The trustees hope for a 1978
completion for the Commons,
but raising money for it is a
major problem.

cer cited the figure of
$1 million as a ‘‘very rough
estimate’’ of the cost for the
Commons.

The Board’s fourth action
was the endorsement of the
revised master plan for the $35
million Development Prog-
ram.

“There were no significant
changes in the master plan,’’
according to Dittman. ‘The

goals remained the same,’’ and’

only: projected times and other
minor details were altered.
