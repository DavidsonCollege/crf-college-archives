dangerous from the outside. They love to run, so it should be an up tempo
game. They are also very experienced. It should be a challenging matchup.”

advanced to the conference semis last year...they shoot the ball from the field
at a 38% rate, good for last in the SC...Askew recently passed the 1,000-point
plateau for her career...Svetlana Trjeskal has established herself as one of the

Player to watch: Adrianna Wilson (5-8, Sr., G, 11.1 ppg)

Filar on the Bucs: “We really don’t know a lot about this team. They are
supposed to have a good transfer player, but they lost two key starters to
graduation and they have been plagued by injuries, so we don’t know who they
will have in their lineup.”

Against App. St., senior for-
ward Carolyn Kirsch sunk three
free throws to become first on the
career lead- x
ers list with

reer records
for points,
field goals,
and rebounds.

Going into this past weekend’s
contest, junior center Jennie
Vanlerberghe ranked 11th in the
nation in field goal percentage,
having made 56 of 89 shots for a
62.9 percentage. Against UMBC

Withits recent success, itis no
surprise that Davidson is currently
dominating many of the statistical
categories in the Southern Confer-

leading the league in field goal
percentage, Kirsch is first in scor-
ing with a 15.6 average while
sophomore guard Jamie Brown
ranks as the leader in free throw
percentage at an 86.2 clip. Asa
team, the Wildcats lead the confer-
ence in six categories (scoring
margin, FG percentage, FG per-
centage defense, blocked shots,
steals and rebound margin).

The only loss that Davidson
has suffered in a month and a half
was a 72-60 defeat to College of
Charleston on January 6th. The
Wildcats should beware of the
Cougars in the future, as they will
join the Southern Conference in
1997-98, becoming the ninth
school in the league to field a
women’s basketball program.

A personal note: Given the
magnitude of the team’s recent
success, it’s time that we put more
fans in the stands for the remaining
games. You can always count on
some community members and
Third East, but otherwise the at-
tendance is pretty poor. With their
11-3 and 3-0 start in conference
play, the Wildcats have a great
chance to earn their first Southern
Conference title and deserve more
fan support. Mark the following
dates on your calendar: Feb. 3,

Again the Wildcats rallied in
the second half. An Ewodo layup
from Landry Kosmalski gave
Davidson a 57-54 lead with 9:07 to
play. But the Mocs scored the next
eight points and did not look back.
A game ending 20-6 run secured
the hard-fought win for the Mocs.

Fatigue undoubtedly hurt
Davidson down the stretch. Davor
Halbauer (knee) sat out the entire
game and Marshall injured his left
ankle after only six minutes, leav-
ing the Wildcats thin.

“When you have to make shots
down the stretch, you need en-
ergy,” said McKillop. “Without
Davour and Stephen, we lost some
energy.”

Davidson split two other con-
ference games over break. On Jan.
8, the Wildcats lost their confer-
ence opener to Marhsall, 85-81,
despite a career-high 27 points
from Mark Donnelly. The Wild-

requisite suffering with the Hor-
nets.

With all due respect, no you
haven’t.

The Hornets became a fran-
chise in 1988, seventy years after
the Boston Red Sox’ last World
Series title. Chicago baseball fans
have suffered even longer - the
Cubs last won it all in 1908, the
White Sox in 1917.

And the day the NFL’s

Seahawks, Bucs, or Saints win the
Super Bow! will have been a long

doing. Seriously though, the Pan-
thers deserve all the praise they’ ve
gotten.

But my role here at Davidson
is that of the stereotypical Yankee
pessimist, and therefore I must
point out that this instant fairtyale
- and 13-win seasons - will end at
some point. For every 12-4, there
is inevitably a 4-12 down the road.

I don’t know when that will
happen. But when it does, then -
and only then - will you become an
honest-to-goodness fan.
