Two Gifts For A Library

It is always gratifying to thank contributors to David-
son, prticularly such men as E. H. Little, whose dedication
to higher learning has ‘helped make Davidson College the
school ‘which it is today.

His latest grant toward the construction of the library
which will bear his name brings the construction of this
important resource center closer to actualization. We feel
that we can speak for the entire student body when we
express our sincere gratitude for his interest in Davidson.

At the same time we want to thank the board of trus-
tees for their decision to reconsider the design of the new
library. It is seldom that the design of a building has
aroused such a degree of universal antipathy. The best
comment which we have heard about the proposed design
is that it isn’t all that bad,’ and that was said rather de-
ensively.

We can only hope that the committee can find a
more appealing design, the kind of place where you
wouldn't mind sending your sister’s book. Clearly the stu-
dent body has demonstrated that they wish to see a
library which is not only functional but also aesthetically
appealing. a octet

While we can see the point in not designing a build-
ing which will be partially hidden by Chambers and still
try to compete with Chambers, it should be more attrac-
tive than the back wall of Richardson Field.

For Lack Of Objections

Although we were looking forward as eagerly as any-
one else to the Wednesday night debate between the NSA
and STOP-NSA spokesmen to form our opinions concern-
ing affiliation, we would like to go on record in support of
continued NSA affiliation.

The organization offers a wide range of services and
information sources which would be advantageous to
Davidson in student government affairs. The real costs
of the affiliation are minimal, and our relationship is not
such that we must endorse all of NSA’s political activity,
although we do not personally find those activities count-
er to our tastes.

The Pressure Of Fun

That the Davidson social system, and especially its
“big weekends.”’ needs improvement is no revelation, even
to those few who direct the social life of the campus. For
it is a basic fact of existence at Davidson that some change
is definitely needed to make life in this socially stagnant
situation more tolerable.

The question, therefore, is ‘‘what” rather than “‘wheth-
er.” What changes are necessary? What direction should
these changes in social life go? Indeed, what can be done
with such a limited social budget? ;

We feel the answer is not to be found in the popula
notion of “bigger and better bands.” Besides being finan-
cially unfeasible, the big band syndrome would inevitably
promote an unneeded atmosphere of social intensity, which
coupled with the normal academic pressures would make
Davidson unbearable.

Moreover, the big-band-type social structure would
serve to reinforce the inability of many Davidson. students
to entertairr and enjoy themselves and those around them.
At a campus already sexually and socially isolated, the ef-
fects of the big-band syndrome could be drastically nega-
tive, for concert entertainment rarely lends itself to the
experience of interpersonal growth and relationships with
fellow humans.

Rather, the solution to the students’ social plight can
already be found in the philosophy of the Social Council,
though it has yet to be put into practice. Duff Bruce, chair-
man of the group, has said that ‘“‘we want to bring people
together to have a good time, to laugh and enjoy them-
selves.” Such a concept is healthy. especially at laughter-
less Davidson, for it allows for self-entertainment and
therefore self-enjoyment and growth. It also leaves the
door open for several varying forms of entertainment,
both cultural and social.

We urge the Social Council to strive to put these ideas
into practice, forsaking the glamorous and glorious (he it
vaudeville folderol or “big blast” bands) for a more real-
istic, complete, and enjoyable approach to Davidson social
life.

Offensive Colloquial Language

Forms Student Vernacular

In a column of a few weeks
ago, I used a colloquial expres-
sion in referring to two specific
areas of the female anatomy
(‘two tits and an ass"). I used
the phrase not arbitrarily, but
because I felt it fit the context
of my column and contributed
to the point I was trying to

‘make.

The column drew a response
from a Davidson faculty mem-
ber who was offended by the
use of phrase. I have no axe to
grind with Dr. Workman — he
was thoughtful enough to ex-
press his opinion about my col-
umn (he also said some very
nice things about the column)
and I feel I can justify my use
of “two tits and an ass.” -

His response to the column
does. however. touch upon a
very important issue: how much
freedom of expression can be
assumed by a college newspa-
per — or. conversely, how much
must a college newspaper re-
flect (in use of language. if
nothing else) the standards of
the college community.

The issue is only beginning to
be confronted here. but at other
area schools freedom of expres-
sion and standards of “taste”
have met head on. At Clemson,
for example, the student news-
paper carried a photo of a but-
ton the logo of which included
the word ‘‘fuck.”

Taking up three-quarters of
the front page of the next issue
of the paper was a letter from
the president of the university
to the editor-in-chief threaten-
ing to suspend publication of
the newspaper if that word (or
others like it) appeared in print
again. The letter ended with
“If there is another issue of this
newspaper, this letter must ap-
pear in total on the front page."

Mary Washington College in
Virginia ran a reprint of an
article from THE VILLAGE
VOICE which contained the
Same objectionable word. and
the college received threats
from several state legislators to
suspend funding of the news-
paper if further incidents oc.
curred.

Why the vituperative response
to the use of ‘‘four letter
words?" It has its roots in our
Puritan heritage.

The two most offensvie words
one could use, I suppose, would
be “shit” and “fuck.” Both have
to do in their root meaning with
‘private’ bodily functions
“fuck,” from the Germanic Mid-
die English verb fucken, ‘to
strike, move. quickly, pene-
trate”; ‘‘shit,” also from the
Middle English shiten, ‘to void
excrement.”

The nomenclature of these
functions — sex and defecation,
our Puritan fathers strictly
avoided.

To see the influence of~‘the
Purification” one has only to
go past the 17th century to, for
example, Chaucer. Geoffrey's
good Middle English word
*‘queynte” hardly translates in-
to 20th century English as pud-
endum.

We are also in the midst of
a vocabulary time lag. Words
such as the ones mentioned
above have been in use in fie-
tion for years.

Both words have even been
deemed respectable enough to
have been included in the Amer-
ican Heritage Dictionary. Most
people accept their usage in
fiction, but for some reason
flinch to see them in newsprint.

Finally, such stringent ob-
jections are symtomatic of a
general generation gap in speech
habits. Like it or not, words
which in our parent's college
days were muttered under one’s
breath and said aloud only with.
in the confines of the locker
room (and NEVER by ladies)
are now used openly and with-

CECIL BURNEY

out apology.

To the present college gen.
eration such words are accepta.
ble as part of everyday speech
and carry no more taboo than
any other four letter word.

So long as there are journal.
ists there will always be ques.
tions of journalistic taste. Any
word can be misused.

But the vociferous attack
against a few particular words
goes beyond a matter of taste,
however, and secks to deny stu.
dents the right to use the lan.
Ewage of students in their own
newspapers.

Jeffersonian Plan

Ignores Present

In this issue of THE DAVID-
SONIAN vou will find a pieture
of an architect's rendering of
the design of the proposed E.
H. Little Library. This library
will cost four million dollars
and is the most major building
project since the construction
of Chambers Building.

It will probably be the most
extensive building project for
the next lwenty years of David.
son's history. Because of these
factors, it is crucial that we
reflect carefully on tis propos-
ed design.

The design proposed is not a
piece of twentieth century arch.
itecture. It is a nineteenth cen-
tury building in design. It
is a fairly flat, rectangular
shaped box which, archectural-
ly, echoes designs from Duke
Dormitory, the front of Little
Dormitory, and parts of the
Cunningham Fine Arts Build-
ing and the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church.

What the architects have done
iS to choose themes from ex-
isting campus buildings so as
lo construct something which
does not clash with other cam-
pus structures.

In terms of local _ politics,
what has happened is that the
traditionalists have won out
again, and the new library will
continue the traditional Jeffer-
sonian style of the rest of the
campus.

Local library officials are
building in the twentieth cen-
tury, They are building a mon-
ument to the past and not a
creation for the present.

It is tragic that the library
planners have not responded to
the magnificent contributions
which modern architecture can
make to a campus such as
ours. The spirit of our times
cries out for imaginativeness
and freedom in the design of
our buildings.

It cries for new forms and
new structures which are con-
temporary and enable man to
expand his spirit and his con.
sciousness in new directions.

Sometimes in the future,
Davidson is. going to have to
break its architectural tradi-
tion to bring itscif up-to-date,
This library design docs not

achieve a new approach to
Davidson's architecture which
1. so very badly needed.

Ahhough this is Davidson's
big chanee to move into the
present and to prepare for the
future. the Library Planning
Commitiee has not taken ad
vantage of it.

Because the library plans
will probably be used as the
model for future buildings in
the next couple of decades, we
are essentially stagnating the
development of the campus.

It would be very much _ pos-
zitde io design a modern build-
ing for this campus which does
not clash with other arctitee-
tural forms. Other campuses
have effectively done this.

ll is a reai shame that some
people are trying hard to keep
the past so alive that it makes
then unable to live in the pre-
sent.

It is particularly unfortunate
heat so many of the trustees as
well as -college administrators
here have taken the attitude
now that we must “get moving
with the building regardless of
what the thing looks like.”

This is insensitive and irre-
sponsible. Building a major
building of this size and scope
necessitates more careful af-
tention to the aesthetic spirit
of the building than this.

Some time ago, Goethe wrote
“First we build buildings: then
they build us.” The unfortun-
ate thing about the E. H. Little
library design is that we
are an outmoded building- If
we build outmoded buildings.
they'll likely build outmoded
people.

The design of the E. H. Little
Library is out of date, unimag-
inative, and blatantly unattrac-
tive and if. the College is real
ly interested in having an ac-
tive curriculum in an_ active
setting which will attract stu-
dents and give them a chance
to grow in new ways, then it
had better junk these old plans
and start on the trail to new
plans which have some real
meaning.

1 will be a real shame if the
Davidson Community allows a
building of this old style to be
built.
