Ross Smyth said that single
units with a unified
boarding house and meeting
room would greatly improve the
fraternity system as a whole.
He felt that the difference in
cost is not enought to necessi-

Roger Powell, Charlie Drum-

that the single units would be
better for the fraternity system

Separate Houses Seem Best

(An Editorial)

The fraternity system at Davidson College is
faced with a fundamental choice: we can stand still
and dé nothing, or we can move forward by pro-
viding future Davidson men with adequate facilities
necessary for a dynamic fraternity system.

In making this choice, we should remember
that in all probability, only the present Freshman
class will enjoy the new fraternity court. Therefore,
it is up to us to leave behind the best that we can.
By all reason, we should weigh the financial cost
of the duplex and ‘the single units. But.in consider-
ing this cost, let us think of what will be most satis-
factory and most pleasant, as well as most adequate,

. for those who follow after we leave.

INDIVIDUALITY

For this reason, the single-unit plan with base-
ment seems to be the most desirable choice. Its ad-
vantages are great. With a single-unit house, there
need be no fear of one fraternity being identified
with another. The single-unit eliminates any prob-
lems that may airse when two fraternities live under
the same roof. .

Also the single-unit house will permit new: fra-
ternities to come on campus one-by-one. Under the
duplex, it would be economically necessary to have
an even number of fraternities, thereby necessitat-
ing admittance in pairs.

Perhaps, the greatest advantage is that every fra-
ternity wants to keep its own individuality. This is
understandable in that all chapters prefer to be
separate and in their own private house.

NOTHING HALF-WAY

The building of a completely new fraternity
court is too large a matter to be done in a second-
rate manner, If the new court is worthwhile, then
it is worth building right. Let us do nothing now
that me might regret later. Let us not go half-way
when we can have the best.

Davidson men of a past generation provided us
with the best that their time could offer, and we of
this generation must provide future Davidsonians
with the best that our time can offer.

7 ELECTION FLASH

Bob Huffaker and Charlies Rutherford won the race for
the two Student Council seats to represent the rising Junior
Class.

Runoffs will be necessary in the other Council elections.
Those remaning are:

ministration, and then to the
college trustees at their Da-
vidson meeting on May 16.

One of these plans would
call for the building of single
unit fraternity houses, one for
each fraternity, at a cost of
$30.000 per unit.

The alternate plan, an-
nounced earlier, (see David-
sonian March 8, 1957) proposes
duplex units, each housing two
fraternities. The cost of each
of these units would be $48,-
000, or $24,000 per fraternity.

Two ideas have been ad-
vanced which insure an equita-
ble part for cach fraternity in
the financing of this project.

The first plan would institute
