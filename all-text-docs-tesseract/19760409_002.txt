Faculty censures

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Editor

Tuesday, while the new basketball coach was collecting
his things at Maryland, and Davidson College students
were planning a march to protest the academic calendar,
the faculty met and passed resolutions.

These resolutions were wu. ‘d as protest measures.
The first protested the trustee decision. to pursue a
national level basketball program:

The Faculty hereby expresses to the Board of Trustees
its concern over the recent action of the Trustees
regarding the intercollegiate basketball program at
Davidson. Over a period of years, members of the Faculty
have questioned the wisdom of subsidized athletics at
Davidson. We affirm our opposition to the present
commitment to a “national level basketball program,”
both on principle and as a matter of economic practicality.
We believe that the stated assumptions on which the
Trustees’ action was based are of questionable validity.

Before taking a vote, which showed about two-thirds of
the faculty in favor of the resolution, the faculty heard
discussion from its members. One professor suggested
that the new basketball coach could make $60,000 a year.
He compared this figure with the average salary of a
professor at Davidson which is aobut one-third the
‘amount.

Other discussions centered on the claims that Davidson
will have to lower its admission standards for exceptional
athletes. The entire integrity of the athletic program was
questioned at one point when it was implied that Gary
Walters, the head coach at Dartmouth who accepted and
then declined the Davidson head coaching offer, had been
asked to go against his conscience and break his contract
with Dartmouth.

The faculty also passed a resolution protesting the
scheduling of Spring Frolics weekend:

Resolved: that the Davidson college faculty protests the
sdheduling of Spring Frolics on Maundy Thursday, Good
Friday, and the Saturday of Easter weekend as
inronsonant with the college’s religious commitment and
as offensive to the religious sensibilities of many in the
college communtiy and the town.

The faculty heard a statement on the situetion from
Union President Karl Goodhouse who defended the

scheduling of Spring Frolics on the basis that Easter
weekend seemed to be the least offensive to everyone
concerned.

The faculty voted in favor of the resolution by a voice
vote. It was not by an overwhelming majority.

Dormitory crime increases
Meetze laments repair bill

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Editor

Davidson college is suffer-
ing from an increase of campus
vandalism. The reparation of
damages will cost the college
over $5000 this year alone.

The college is not making an
attempt to increase discipline
of student vandals but is
instead appealing to students
and student groups to police
themselves.

In recent weeks a prankster
has removed the hinges from a
‘bathroom door so that the
next person to come in would
accidentally knotk the door
down and damage a urinal.
The urinal cost $4000 to
replace.

The doors and shower cur
tains in bathrooms in Watts
were removed forcing girls on
these halls to call the physical
plant to repair the damage by
working overtime. Two entire
windows were destroyed in
Sentelle. Reparation of this
damage will take extra time
because the woodwork must
be copied.

‘‘In the past three years
vandalism has doubled as far
as frequencies are concerned,”
said Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze, Jr.

‘‘Horseplay with fire ex-
tinguishers has doubled. Its
gotten to the point that we
can’t keep them in the build-
ings,’’ said Meetze. ‘‘It is
$1000 a year just to replace

fire extinguishers. It takes
about nine dollars apiece.”

Meetze said that it is his
philosophy that a building
should be maintained in as
good a condition ~s possible.
this makes it more ay-'
tractive to the students who
live there and do not take part
in destruction. According to
Meetze, however, competent
maintenence is not a deterrant
to vandals.

Dean of Students Will H.
Terry believes the problem of
current vandalism began with
a lack of discipline on fresh-
men halls.

“Vandalism is part of an
attitude we have allowed to
develop from freshman year.

mind. These include a display
area for Davidson’s own art
collection and student exhibits
and a home for the Davidson
National,’’ said Williams.

“By locating this art gallery
at the center of the campus,
we are symbolically and liter-
ally emphasizing the
importance of the arts at a
liberal arts college.

‘‘The Cunningham Fine
Arts Building is clearly inade-
quate for present and projec-
ted needs,”’ said Williams.

“The Department of Drama
and Speech needs new class-
room, production, and storage
facilities. No definite plans at
all have been made, but a
building of 20,000 square feet
should house the Department.

“Physical education facili-
ties and intramural needs are
becoming increasingly acute,’
said Williams.

‘‘Officials of the Athletic
Department are working on

plans for a sports complex
that might include additional
athletic fields, indoor tennis
courts, indoor track, addi-
tiona! handball and squash
courts, swimming pool, and a
non-spectator basketball
fieldhouse with several courts.

schools have suffered a loss in
enrolllment. We don’t anti-
cipate that happening here,
but if it should, we wouldn’t
be able to convert a traditional
dorm to any other use.

“The College owns about 60
houses in the area, in varying
states of repair, which it rents
to faculty, staff, and other,”
continued Williams. ‘‘Some of
the dwellings are on the fringe
of the campus, and we plan to
make these perimeter houses
available to students..

“I don’t think we’re
sacrificing our character as a
residential campus by not
building a new dorm as some
have charged. Many people,
especially older students,
prefer the unit-type living of
perimeter housing,’’ said
Williams.

Piecemeal renovation of
dorms will occur in the sum-
mers as funds become
available.

“The present food service
setup is inefficient,’’ said
Williams. ‘‘It is widely recog-
nized that so many kitchens
and cooks are not economical.

“The eating-house concept
works well with lesser enrol-
ments,” he continued, “but it
isn’t viable for the future,
especially if enrollment
increases to 1500.

“No new construction will
be undertaken until funds are
on hand to complete the job
and money is endowed to
maintain the  building,”’
concluded Williams.
