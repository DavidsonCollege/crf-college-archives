HAD TO MOVE

*.

Shown here is one example of the overcrowded class at Davidson; an English 81 class
taught by Dr. Purcell. This class had to move from Room 208 to 335 in order to seat the 45
students in the course. Even now, the class is overcrowded.

This is the first year that the Trustee’s decision has been implemented. If enrollment
continues to increase at this rate, then soon many more classes will be added to the already
alarming list of those containing over 50 students.
