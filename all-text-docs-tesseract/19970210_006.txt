Republicans receive Clinton
budget as good starting point

Vice President Al Gore called
it creating a Government fit for a
new century as the administration
revealed its plan to balance the bud-
get by the year 2002.

Republican leaders thought the
Clinton plan would not balance any-
thing by then or years beyond.

But, despite the partisan differ-
ences, it does serve as a starting
point.

Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott (R.-Miss.) said, “It’s alive, but
its definitely not kicking.”

To balance the budget, Presi-

dent Clinton proposed $252.1 bil-
lion worth of deficit reduction. But
75.3% of the cuts or $190 billion is
scheduled for the last two years,
well after he has left office.

The budget included tax cuts
for middle class families, college
tuition, and capital gains for hous-
ing sales. It would increase spend-
ing on education, the environment,
and state programs. It tries to re-
store some of what he saw were
harsh measures of last year=s wel-

fare bill by increasing some spend-
ing there.

The administration, along with
Congressional Democrats, also
wishes to expand health insurance
to half of the 10 million American
children who do not have it. It is
part of the President’s plan to slowly
expand healthcare provision to most
uninsured Americans.

Ironically, though, the largest
chunk of savings comes from cuts
in Medicare and Medicaid. The
president hopes to save at least $122
billion by decreasing payments to
hospitals and doctors.

Along with $98 million in tax
cuts, the President proposes increas-
ing tax revenues by closing loop-
holes and cutting some corporate
welfare. It should bring another $76
billion to the budget.

The biggest difference between
the two parties is the capital gains
tax cut. Republicans want the cur-
rent 29% rate on all investments to
be halved. They believe it would
increase investment since many who

gained in the stock markets advances
these past couple of years would re-
invest in other projects.

The President and most of his
party are against such large cuts,
however. The President only offers
the elimination of the tax on home
sales. They say they want their tax
cuts to go to more targeted areas
such as education and middle class
families with children. :

The President’ s proposal of the
budget is the first in a long step of
actually getting it put into action.
First, the interest groups have not
been able to start lobbying to save
their favored programs.

Second, both parties will try to
claim victory of advancing their
causes and agendas in the budget.
Finally, the economy must stay
strong for the numbers and cuts to
actually work, otherwise tax rev-
enues will drop.

Governors still debating welfare reform

Welfare reform was the hot
topic at the National Governor’s
Association winter meeting.

The governors were meeting to
discuss how the nation would cope
with the. new state power to admin-
ister welfare services via block
grants from the government among
other issues.

Several Republican governors
supported restoration of aid to legal
immigrants, a provision that used to
be available but was cut out of the
welfare reform bill as a politically

viable way to make savings.

The request caused some Re-
publican Congressional leaders to
question why members of their own
party now wanted to renege on a
crucial provision and savings mea-
sure needed to balance the budget.

Many commentators believe
that now that states actually have to
go through with administering ser-
vices, governors will have more
problems than expected.

An upcoming conflict over the
percentage contributions the state

and federal government over Med-
icaid payments was also signaled at
the conference.

The governors’ voices indicate
that possible disputes such as these
will continue in other areas, espe-
cially in ratifying a balanced budget
amendment to the Constitution.

One person died and at least 100 other were injured as mixed race
rioters caused unrest since they believed they had been denied much
participation in the new South Africa after Apartheid. Protestors said
they were not black or white enough to enjoy the benefits of the new
government. Mixed race people are usually caught between the black
and whites in the country. They were given a largely symbolic and
ineffective chamber of parliament during apartheid. Meanwhile, their
limited power spurned hatred from blacks for “selling out to white
interests.”

North Korea agrees to take nuclear waste from Taiwan

North Korea will accept nuclear waste from Taiwan in exchange for
much needed hard currency. South Korea was outraged, though, over
safety risks and because it wants to avoid liability for the waste in the
event of the North Korea’s possible collapse. South Korean insists the
North Koreans do not have the proper installations and housing
materials to store the waste.

Student proves that S.A.T. misgraded a question

Colin Rizzo, a 17 year old from Peterborough, New Hampshire, was
taking his S.A.T. test when he thought one question was strangely
phrased. He thought it could have been interpreted in different ways
and that the Educational Testing Service that administers the test
might have had the wrong test, so he e-mailed them concerning his
observation. The result was the first time since 1982 that the S.A.T. has
acknowledged a mistake in their test grading and will lead to score
increase of 30 points for about 13% of the test takers who answered the
right math question on the test.
