THE DAVIDSONIAN

Press RELEASE

F. Kim Hodgson, general manager of WAMU
radio in Washington, D.C., and chairman of the
board of National Public Radio (NPR), has been
appointed station manager of WDAV, Classical
89.9 radio, in Davidson.

WAMU is Washington’s major public radio
outlet ‘for news, talk, and traditional American
music programming. Hodgson will succeed John
Clark, who retired as WDAV's station manager
on June 30 following 17 years in that position.

@ F. Kim Hodgson

Arts & LIVING worn, ocrosess
NPR Board Chair will lead Davidson’s WDAV Radio

Hodgson will begin work in Davidson on Novem-
ber | with intentions of expanding the station’s
commitment to promote all fine arts in the region.
Jamie May, vice president for college relations at
Davidson, said the college will benefit greatly
from Hodgson’s decision to accept the position.
“Listeners in this area appreciate the high quality
of programming on WDAV, and Kim Hodgson’s
knowledge of public radio on a national level will

help us improve that service,” he said.

A New Perspective

Hodgson was elected to the NPR board in
1994, and its members selected him as their chair
in November 1996. That position has immersed
him in strategic thinking about the industry and

helped him develop relationships with public

broadcasting leaders nationwide. Hodgson has
one year of board membership remaining and says
that WDAV will add a new perspective to his
board service. “It is very important that stations
like WDAV be at the table in organizations where

the future of public radio is being plotted,” he said.
“Believe me, stations in major markets like New
York, San Francisco, and Washington don’t have
all the answers!”

Hodgson described WDAV as “ajewel among
public radio stations.” He praised its professional
staff, integrity of programming, and its commit-
ment to promote and support all forms of fine arts
in the area.

Revolutionary technological innovations are
making that commitment even more important,
Hodgson said. “The challenge to classical radio is
to avoid replacement by satellite broadcasting.
The key question for stations like WDAV is how

toremain relevant to the community in whichthey
operate so that people won’t opt to get their music

from a national satellite service. WDAV has to
offer its listeners something that compels them to
listen every day, while remaining true to its fine
arts mission.”

A Reputation of Excellence

He said the station’s excellent reputation in
the public radio world and its mission to serve the
arts community attracted him to the position. In
addition, he and his wife, Judy, look forward to
living in the close-knit community of Davidson
and relocating closer to Hodgson’s parents in At-
lanta.

Hodgson has worked in non-commercial ra-
dio since 1966, beginning as’ producer of educa-
tional programs for the University of Chicago. He
was program director for the nation’s first Native
American owned radio station, KTDB in Ramah,
N.M., and managed stations for Minnesota Public
Radio, the University of Washington, and WETA
in Washington before joining WAMU. During his
tenure at WAMU, the station budget grew from $1
million to $6. million, the number of supporting
members grew from 10,000 to 35,000, the full-
time professional staff more than doubled to 43
people, and the station built a new 10,000-square-
foot broadcast building. WAMU nowattracts more
than 450,000 listeners weekly, and produces more
than 15 hours of programming weekly for distribu-
tion to National Public Radio member stations
around the country.

An Evolving Score

WDAV began programming as a public
service of the Trustees of Davidson College in
1978. Under John Clark’s direction since 1981, it
grew from a 20,000 watt station whose signal
barely reached northern Charlotte to a 100,000
watt broadcast service that reaches a 22-county
area of the Carolinas. :

In addition to airing classical music 24-
hours a day, Classical 89.9 promotes cultural arts
events throughout the region on the air and on its
web site, in the monthly programming magazine,
through co-sponsorship of events, and with cre-
ation of new events like the Music Listening
Contest for young music lovers. The ultimate
expression of this philosophy occurred during
the station’s 20th anniversary celebration last
year. The station commissioned a composition,
“Voice of the Wood,” from North Carolina com- .
poser Russell Peck. The Charlotte Symphony
performed the world premiere, which was broad-
cast live locally by WDAV and syndicated na-
tionally.

Hodgson holds a master of arts degree in
speech-radio/T V/film from the University of Wis-
consin and a bachelor’s degree in drama from
Antioch College. When he is not working, he
enjoys reading, long walks, and listening to a
wide variety of music. He believes that, ideally,
every day should begin with a bit of Bach. He and
Judy have four grown children.
