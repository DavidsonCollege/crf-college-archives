Currie a announces re vision |
Of: accounting system

By PEG TRAVIS
Staff Writer

College Business Manager
Robert A. Currie, Jr. has
proposed a new system for
management of the houses on
Patterson Court in light of the
inconsistent bookkeeping pro-
cedures which have caused
difficulties in the past.

This new system should
provide an easier method for
the treasurers to maintain
bookkeeping efficiency.

Each year Currie and the
house treasurers m2et to dis-
cuss operation ind regulation
of the court. Last. spring the
group decided that the exist-
ing system of simply auditing
the houses was insufficient.

“This should be an ongoing
operation,’’ said Currie.
‘‘What the fraternities and
houses need is help through-
out the school year rather than
justa ‘summary of previous
years.’

Recently appointed Frater-
nity Liaison Auditor Harry L.
Albert, Jr. '77 is reviewing
last year’s budgets and re-
cords as well as determining

purpose and policies of the
College as set forth in the
Davidson College constitu-
tion.’’ This revision is expec-
ted to be approved in the
October Trustees meeting.

Opposes bids

Spencer also sought to head
off recent attempts by some
students to reinstate written
bids to fraternities on the
Court.

Spencer complained that
any such move would bring
Davidson closer to the old
social system (85% fraternity
membeship, 15% indepen-
dent) which, he said, branded
some as “social illiterates,’’
channeled loyalties narrowly,
insulated people, and pre-
vented students from making
broader friendships.

Spencer acknowledged that
all the eating housings “have
informal ways of letting a
person know that he or she is

which system will be most
satisfactory.

“One thing that Harry has
dong in working for us,”’
Currie stated, ‘‘has been to
prepare a uniform accounting
system for the six fraternities
or clubs that are not nationals.
The national fraternities have
their own forms requiring
periodic reports.

These non-nationals do not
have any uniform system.
That’s what we’re trying tp
do—to set up a system for
them so that they can keep
proper records.”

In his recommendations for
the new accounting system
Albert states, ‘‘Of course, we
hope that the four nationally
affiliated eating houses will
comply to the greatest extent
possible and still maintain the
procedures outlined by their
respective national offices.’

Currie emphasizes that with
this new system he is not
trying to direct the houses but
‘“‘to pinpoint for them any
trouble spots’’ that might
arise. ‘‘We try to advise them
about the variables that are

welcome or unwelcome’’ and
that ‘‘this sometimes involves
hurt and disappointment,’”’
but he insisted that ‘‘the hurt
is far less than that of a
student who is formally and
publically rejected.”’

‘“‘IT am strongly convinced
that it would be a serious
mistake to take even one step
backward toward a system
based on formal exclusion.”’

Spencer contended that the
current self-selection system
provides a place for fraterni-
ties and said that those frater-
nities are vigorous and
healthy.

Supports Women

Spencer said that he sup-
ported the efforts of the wo-
men at Rusk House is spite of
fears expressed by some that
the House could move toward
the practices characteristic of
many sorority groups.

He believes that the Rusk
House alternative i is a means

involved, such as utility rates,
food rates and the number of
members.”

Currie also emphasizes that
the treasurers themselves are
not to blame for the state of
the records. “Continuity is the
difficult thing here. We nor-
mally have different treasurers
every year. They only go
through a brief training per-
iod.”’

Currie commended the
house treasurers saying,
“Most people on campus real-
ly don’t realize the skill and
time it takes to do a good job
as fraternity treasurer.’’ Each
house has a budget that varies
from $30,000 to $50,000.

The treasurers’ duties in-
clude preparing a budget,
setting board and social rates,
collecting dues, complying
with wage-hour laws, making
payments for services, and
filing quarterly.and annual tax
reports.

Albert intends to meet with
the treasurers of the six non-
national houses individually
and present his recommenda-
tions for a uniform system.

of meeting the special needs
and desires of women on a
campus that still ‘‘betrays the
fact that we are a college for
men which has graciously
permitted women to join us.”’

Spencer underscored the
College’s genuine desire to
recruit and make ‘‘at home”’

more black students, staff,“

and faculty members. He pro-
mised that ‘‘special attention’’
would be devoted to the
recruitment of blacks.

Evaluation

Spencer pledged that the
new Academic Vice-President,
Price Zimmerman, would work
in cooperation with faculty
and students to devise proce-
dures of faculty evaluation for
promotion and tenure.

Spencer believes that stu-
demts do not have the profes-
sional qualifications or exper-
ience to make some of the
judgements that go into eval-
uation, but admits that -stu-
dents ‘‘are in a better position
than anyone else to judge
some of the aspects of good
teaching,’’ and thinks that

Lovell’s initial task will be

tant part in evaluation those

Budget

Spencer announced that the
College operated without a
deficit during its last fiscal
year, in keeping with his
Administration’s policy of. a-
voiding the deficits that today
plague some small colleges.

“There were ups and downs
on both sides of the budget,
but the over-runs onthe
expense side were balanced by
additional revenue on the in-
come side.’’ Major expense
over-runs were in Athletics
($110,000), Instruction
($77,000), Utilities and Repairs
($38,000), and Investment Ser-
vice ($20,000).

A _ larger-than-anticipated
freshman class, favorable in-
vestment earnings, and an
increase in gifts to operating
expenses from alumni all
brought unexpected revenue

that preserved the balanced.

budget.

Spencer reminded the au-
dience that he had last year
advised ‘‘that during the first
full year of the athletic pro-
gram directed by the Trustees,
there would be an over-run in
that area.

“IT also said that the athletic
budget this year would be
made a realistic one, and that
those responsible for the ad-
ministration of it--and all oth-
er areas of the budget—unders-
tand that the budget is a limit
which cannot be exceeded ex-
cept for reasons over which the
College has no control.”

to raise the necessary funds
for the power boost. His _
immediate goal is $70,000, and
he will contact foundations,
civic organizations, and invid-
uals seeking financial commit-
ments.

Last spring the college sub-
mitted an application for a
grant from HEW to fund the
shift to high power, but the
college has only been told that
the application is ‘‘accepted
for consideration.”’,

“The thing that is holding
us back is money. Once we get
the money, we know what
kind of equipment we want;
once we get the equipment we
can go on the air, once we go
on the air we can start
developing an audience, then
we can expand,”’ said Lovell.

In the meantime, Barrett is
gearing his staff for the shift
to high power by introducing a
training program. ‘‘I want
ours to be a very professional
staff, with each person li-
censed. We’re also striving for
an extensive knowledge of the
music being played, the tech-
nical equipment, and last but
not least, an awareness of
proper radio decorum.”’

Lovell, too, stresses the
need for a professional atti-
tude among student staff, and

_at the same time points out

that such student involvement
can be a big ‘‘plus”’ factor
when promoting the station :to
the public. ‘‘I want people to
listen and be able to say, ‘Hey,
those are students that are
doing such a remarkable job!’”’

The high-power WDAV will
emphasize educational and
classical programming, but
Lovell emphasizes that the
precise format will be deter-
mined after the station goes on
the air.

‘We have to try our product
on the community and then
get feedback from the com-
munity,’ Lovell said.

That feedback will be
weighed when determining the
format, ‘'so that. we finally
