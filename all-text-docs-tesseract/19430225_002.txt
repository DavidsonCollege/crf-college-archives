Dear Ed: _

There has been in the past so much
praise of the Davidson clections sys-
tem, which many fccl is the best that
could be operative at a school like David
son, that it seems almost a sacrilege to
suggest that all are not so heartily in
tavor of the “closed politics” system.

First, it must be admitted that such a
system has many important advantages,
particularly in dispensing with the politi

seems to be some need to create more
