Counselingsystem ensured,

Preventative work proposed q

By AMANDA HALL
Asst. Sports Editor

Davidson College psycholo-
gical counseling will continue
to operate at the same level on
which it is operating this year
in 1976-77.

The college employs three
part-time clinical psycholo-
gists, Dr. W. Gatewood
Workman, Dr. Amelia Dock-
ery, and Dr. Meredith Hall at
present. Their combined coun-
seling time equals that of a
full-time counselor.

Workman will be available
to counsel only during winter
term next year, leaving one
day per week without a coun-
selor on campus.

“We will be making adjust-
ments for the fall and spring,”
said Dean of Students Will. H.
Terry, “but we don’t have any
definite plans. There will be
the fifth day, but whether
there will be a third psycho-
logical we don’t know.”

Davidson initiated the coun-
seling program several years
ago, acording to Terry.

“A lot of people felt the need
for it, but the biggest pressure
for it has been from the SGA.
Student government has been
so convinced of its importance
in the past that they put some
money in it,’’ said Terry.

Workman counseled along
with his regular course load
originally , but Hall joined him
in 1971. Dockery joined the
staff in 1974, bringing the
counseling program to the
present level. :

Davidson College finances
the entire program now. The
counseling has good support
among the faculty and gene-
rally good support among the
administration, according to
Terry.

The counselors serve the
students basically for crisis
intervention but according to
Dockery, many students drop
in just to say, ‘I’m okay.’’
Most students meet with the
counselors three or four times.
“It’s productive to have well
trained people with whom the
students can have confidence
when the anxiety level gets too
high, or just to assure them

that they are okay,’’ said

Terry.

The most prevelant problem
among the students is a
feeling of isolation and inabi-
lity to relate to others, accord-
ing to Dockery. ‘‘Even stu-
dents who aren't in counseling
can’t relate,’’ she said.

‘I'd like to see our counsel-
ing experience in Davidson
move into a more touching
siebiate,69 Relating with a
person who is trained or who is
a good listener is a very
enriching experience,’’ said
Dockery.

Both Terry and Dockery

WDAV cans Watts,
sealy takes charge

By DANA BEACH
Staff Writer

WDAV station engineer
Jeff Watts was dismissed late
last week. His position has
been filled by thirty-year vete-
ran of radio Paul Sealy.

FCC regulations require
that radio stations maintain a
station engineer and in comp-
liance WDAV hired Watts in
September.

Jack Golden, WDAV sta-
tion manger, explained that
although Watts initially
proved adequate, he later be-
came guilty of negligence of
his position.

“Jeff was a. bit overextend-
ded,’’ said Golden. ‘‘He has
been responsible for four radio
stations at once. Since we are
not a commercial station we
can afford for things to go
wrong. That is, in his opi-
nion.”’

Last seen on December 1,
Watts repeatedly forsook his
duties to the station. Golden
cited a number of incidents
demonstrating the actions
that led to Watt’s dismissal.

Watts removed a small mo-
tor for repair early in the
academic year and has yet to
return it. A promise to procure

work, education, conferences
and lectures, with less empha-
sis on crisis intervention. The
school needs to use the coun-
selors better to help prevent
anxiety and problems from
arising and to train and to
advise the faculty and hall
counselors on how to counsel
or advise people, according to
Terry.

‘“‘We need these people who
are trained to deal with prob-
lems that occur that the
faculty doesn’t have the train-
ing or confidence to deal with.
Sometimes these people can

has, to Golden’s anguish,
never been realized. These
incidents, combined with
Watt’s truancy at the station,
convinced Golden that im-
mediate action was necessary.

“I doubt that I will ever see
that motor. In fact we have
ordered a new one. Since I
have not been able to look Jeff
in the face since December, I
have no idea what he has done
with it,”’ said Golden.

Paul Sealy, currently em-
ployed by WSOC radio in
Charlotte, has agreed to take
the post.

Golden feels that Sealy has
already accomplished a great
deal in station improvements.
He has replaced faulty tubes
in the transmitter and reposi-
tioned it in the attic of the
Union.

“‘He has been on the stick.
He’s already been here more
times than Jeff had, and he’s
only been here two weeks,’’
said Golden. The first time he
came here he decided that we
need to put our transmitter in
the attic. This has been most
helpful. He is also a good
source of equipment for us. He
has already located a lot of
things we can use,”’ concluded
Golden.

that occur that the faculty doesn’t have the
training or confidence to deal with.” -Leon Venable

Author blasts porno, prostitution

Author Susan Brownmiller recently spoke at Denison
University in Granville, Ohio and claimed that ‘‘rape can
be eradicated from our culture.’’ Brownmiller is author of
Against Our Will, which is a comprehensive study of rape.

Brownmiller claimed that rape could be stopped if ‘‘two
tenacious institutions, pornography and prostitution,’
were eliminated from society. Pornography, said
Brownmiller, is anti-female propaganda which depicts
“rape as an act of erotocism.”’

Prostitution gives men the idea that if ‘‘the right to a
woman’s body can be bought then it can also be taken
without payment,” said Brownmiller.

Brownmiller also said that reform of rape laws is
hindered by male fear of false rape charges.

NCAA challenges Title IX

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
has filed suit against the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW). to challenge HEW
regulations issued under Title IX of the Education
Amendments Act of 1972.

_ Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex

..under any education program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance.” The NCAA feels that HEW
erred in extending the regulations to college athletics,
since there are no intercollegiate athletic programs
receiving Federal financial assistance.

The NCAA also feels that several of the regulations are
unreasonable and arbitrary, including an ‘“‘illegal quota
system for determining equality of opportunity.’’

Trustees claim no involvment in Brickels firing

Fourthly, ‘in order to offer facili-

fire Brickels was a result of pressure
brought upon the administration by a
small group of influential trustees
and/or alumni.

“The trustees will back the Wildcat
Club and back the administration,’
said Cartmill. ‘‘The decision was not

that of the trustees,’’ he continued,’’

or of the Wildcat Club.”

Chairman of the Trustee Athletic
Committee Dr. Hugh D. Verner also
maintained that no pressure was put
on the administration by either
trustees or alumni. He categorically
denied any attempt to influence the
administration.

Brickels was not available ie

Brickels deserved another year as
head coach. ‘‘Coach Brickels was
never given a chance to defend
himself,’’ said Rixey.

‘“‘E can see the trustees getting
anxious,’ said Dore. “‘But I can see
improvement too, maybe to around
-510 or .520 next year.

‘‘I thought he deserved another
year,’’ he continued. ‘‘At least the
recruiting year. I’m very disappoint-
ed in our progress as individuals and

as a team but we really couldn’t put

the blame on the coaching staff.”’
Rixey indicated that there were ‘‘no
morale problems’’ on the team, even

In an attempt to initiate the
reconstruction of Davidson basketball

mously passed a resolution which
“strongly reaffirms the commitment
of the college'to a national level of
intercollegiate basketball program.”’

The trustees put forward five
points which they believe must be met
if Davidson basketball is to return to
its former, nationally competitive
level.

First, they believe that ‘‘a level of
coaching must be provided that is
experienced, dedicated, and with
demonstrated skill in. a winning
program,”

Secondly, ‘the budget (for basket-
ball) must be competitive with similar
successful programs elsewhere.”

Thirdly, “the College must asso-
ciate itself with strong level basket-
ball schools in conference alignment."

ties which will support a national level
basketball program, the development
and planning of a recreational athletic
facility (field house) must remain a
high priortiy item in the next capital
funds drive.”

How high a priority the ‘‘recrea-
tional athletic facility’’ holds seems as
yet undecided.

Lastly, ‘‘The cooperation of the .
Wildcat Club must be obtained to
provide supplementary funds to
achieve certain of these objectives.”

The creation of a competitive
basketball program will begin with a
search for a new coach. At the
moment, the College has no one in
mind, but has apparently received
indications that certain coaches at
major institutions may be interested.
