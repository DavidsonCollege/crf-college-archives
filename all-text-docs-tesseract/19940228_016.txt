Fi ebruary 24, 1994

How important do you think
the trip to Europe last summer
was to the team’s success?
McKillop:. The dependency and
reliance upon each other really
improved as a result of the trip. It
wasn’t Florence or Milan that we
traveled to, it was small cities that
were not accustomed to having
American tourists; and as a result

# of not having the English language
being spoken that frequently, we
really depended on each other for
all of our communication. All of
those (little things) helped form a
sense of trust and helped form a
sense of team unity. We shared the
highs and lows of the experience
we will all share for a lifetime.
Zimmerman: Coach didn’t men-
tion anything of the basketball as-
pect, and that was such a little part
of it. The basketball aspect was
important, but more importantly
than the basketball has been the.
unity. We started coming close
last year and in Europe we really
enhanced. When you're the only
fifteen people that can understand
and talk together you either grow
closer together, or there is dissen-
sion. We grew closer together.

What has been the most diffi-

cult transition from the Big South
Conference to the Southern Con-
ference?

McKillop: I think the players feela
lot more like Division I basketball
players because of the nature of the

, competition. The attention given
to the Southern Conference and
the natural rivalries that existed
prior to our return have helped our
team be a part of that Southern

Conference process, It has really
given a great deal of quality to our
product, and as a result our players
feel much better about themselves.
And in feeling much better they
have worked hard to improve.
What one thing has been the
biggest difference in the last two
years?
Narat: Confidence is a big factor.
“We just have a lot more confi-
dence this year.” We’re capable.
It started in Italy, and then we got
a couple of big
wins early in the
season. “You get
confident when
you start win-
ning.”
McKillop: Dur-
ing the European
basketball experience, we played
against pros, 28 year-old men, with
biased officials and hostile crowds,
and yet we still played well.
Zimmerman: I think another. as-
pect of that is our depth. Every-
body has confidence. We have

McKillop

confidence as a team, yet I have a
great deal of confidence in every-
one of the individuals. I think
everybody has confidence in each
other. I think that started last year
when we had six freshman. Now
they are sophomores. They have
more confidence in themselves,
which in turn gives the rest of the
team more confidence in them.
What players in the past have
served as the best role models?
Zimmerman: Sterling Freeman,

+ Jason Zimmerman plays the guard position.

“92. He was one of the first players
I met when I stepped on campus as
a freshman, and while practicing
against him for two years he gave
me a lot of licks. He was a person
I admired off the court as well. He
had it all together. Another player
was Paul Drobnitch, ‘92. I really
admired him too. He was some-
body I looked up to.

Narat: All of the guys that were
upperclassmen when I came here
as a freshman. They were all guys
we could look up to.

What has been the biggest
emotional boost for the team this
year?

Zimmerman: Emotionally, I think
the biggest one for us was the first
UNCC game, at least personally
for me. It was really the first huge
game that we had won. UNCChad
beaten us five times till this year,
and we had just been to Wake
Forest. We got behind by 20, and
we played close from there on out,
but we’ve played close against a
lot of teams. To get over the hump

e just have a lot more confidence
this year. We're capable.

against UNCC was a big emo-
tional boost for me personally and
for the team. It has been incredible
how it has built since then.
Narat: For me it was the Clemson
game because of the way we took
ittothem. The first half especially
because we were able to build a 20
point lead. It (the win) was a great,
great confidence boost.

What game this year do you
think the team has grown to gain
the most from?

Narat: I think it was the Marshall -

game because we came off two big
wins and we were just not ready to
play. They were ready for us and
we weren’t ready for them. It
reminded us that every team in the
Southern Conference is out to win
basketball games. They aren’t
going to just lay down.

Zimmerman: I think it was the
Citadel for the same reason be-
cause we thou ght we were going to
win the basketball game. From
then on, every other game we have
played since then, we have gone in
with the feeling we are going to
win, but we have to win the game.
In most of the games sirice then we
have gone out and played to win
the basketball game, not just going
out there with the attitude that we
are supposed to win. The game
played there last year sort of turned
our season around then also. They
took it to us, and we decided we

Jj. . would put an end to.that.

Road to the Tournament

With the final game remain-
ing in the regular season tonight,
Davidson could not be in a better
position. A win over VMI gives
us at least the second seed this
weekend along with the school’s
tenth 20-win season. For the past
four years seniors Janko Narat
and Jason Zimmerman have
played their hearts out at many
thankless times. The dreams they

_|had of playing basketball at

Davidson when they arrived here
are now coming true. Standing as
the only two remaining members
McKillop: I would say the Georgia
Southern game at Georgia South-
ern because it was a road game
against a very tough opponent. We
had gotten down by 18 points and
in the last 15 (minutes) there were
sO many turn-arounds, and we
could have packed our bags and
said we gave a great effort. But we
were not content to leave there
unless we were successful. For us
to maintain our perseverance and
come out with a victory was very
big.

What elements of the team’s
play will be focused on the mostin
preparation forthe Southern Con-
ference Tournament?

McKillop: We need to consistently
work on the little things whether it
is diving for loose balls, boxing
out, or stretching for deflections,
the little techniques that do not
show up onascore board or are not
the absolute high for a typical fan.
Those are the things that are going
to win ball games for us at this
juncture, and those are the things
we are getting better at.

After enduring the first five
years, Coach McKillop, what do
you think of the program nowand
its future?

ofa highly praised recruiting class
to play, they have been through
the highs and the lows. But they
will certainly leave on a big, big
high.

Regardless of what happens
the rest of the season, these two
along with Coach McKillop have
helped revive school spirit and a
winning attitude. -

Last Saturday night, 3,114
people showed up to watch the
Wildcats. I can’t remember that
many people coming to a
Davidson game since I have been
here, and if there were more, those
people came to watch the other
team. Now they are coming to
watch Davidson. That feels good
as a student, but it must be in-
credible for a player.
McKillop: Our seniors need to be
respected for what they have es-
tablished, and what they will leave
behind. They leave behind cher-
ished memories for themselves as
well as for our program. We need
to credit the efforts of players such
as the Jay Schmitt’s, the Paul
Drobnitch’s and the Sterling
Freeman’s that need to be com-
mended as a very fine group of
players. We are stocked very well
right now for any team, whether it
is Davidson or Duke, we are very
well covered right now in terms of
what is happening down the road.
I am very optimistic about where
we can go. When you achieve
something, it gives you a taste.
Last year gave us an initial taste,
this year we are getting a bigger
taste. In the years to come we'll get
a bigger taste.

Are. there any other com-
ments?

McKillop: Iam delighted that these
two guys can leave here feeling
that they have reached the point
where we can hang a banner that
will be a part of their experience
for the rest of their lives, so 25
years from now when they return
they can stand here and remember.
