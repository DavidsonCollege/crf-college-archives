Snack Bar Leads
List Of Changes

By Food Service

DOUG BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor
The establishment of a

snack bar and the availabil-

ity of unlimited second help-
ings are just two of the inno-
vations introduced this vear
by Ronald B. Scott, the new
director of the food service
for ARA Slater. ;

‘For a couple of vears stu-
dents have been asking for
snack bar service,” said
Scott. “‘We are presently
serving soup and sandwiches
at the snack bar, but we
hope to bring in some more
equipment which will enable
us to serve a greater variety
of food.

“We have extended the
operation to take the pres-
sure off certain periods of
the day,” commented Scott.
“This is part of our continu-
ing effort to give better serv-
ice to the students.

“One of the advantageous
features of our new program
is that unlimited seconds will
be allowed with the excep-
tion of steak and premium
entrees, he said. ‘‘All any-
one will have vo do is cuz in
line if they desire seconds.’

Many of the changes in
the food service are due
large part to Davidson's end-
ing of its subsidization of the
food program. ‘‘Now that the
college has ended its sub-
Sidization, we are operating
strictly on a profit and loss
basis,” commented Scott.

““Upperclassmen may elect
a 20 meal boarding  pro-
gram’. said Scott. However,
a 20 meal boarding plan is
required for freshmen, with
cighteen meals eaten at the
Student Union and two eaten
at one of the eating clubs.

One of the changes is that
those holding meal tickets
can no longer claim the con-
tinental breakfast which is
served from 8:30 gm. to 1l

a.m. In the past. meal tick
et holders could do this, bu

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. said the ori-
ertation received an over
whelming response from par
ents. “I received many fa-
vorable comments both from
parents directly involved and
from people off campus who
had heard about the  pro-
gram,” he said.

“IT think it was a good idea
to get parents involved in
campus life. It gives them a
sense of attachment to the
college and an interest in its
future,” commented Cannon
Hall Counselor Steve Suflas.

The main criticism of fresh-
men Was with the method of
course selection. Many sens-
