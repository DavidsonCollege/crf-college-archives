The next play, The Christian Slave, by H
K. Russell, was of a deeper and more trag- |
ic nature Medevah, played by the author, |
is prime minister to the Rajah, played by |
Ted Jones. He and the swash-buckling Cap- !
tain of the Guard, Henry Martyn White, |
lay a plot with the aid of Kadmiel, a Chris- |
tian captive, to kill the present Rajah, who!
is a usurper. The reward for Kadmiel, Joe,
Earnest, is to be the release of Romena, a |
Christian girl who has been but recently ta- ,
ken into the harem of the sultan. Kadmiel |
suspects that Medevah’s intentions are di-
rected toward keeping Romena, played by |
Susie Brady, for himself. Meanwhile, Ro- |
mena is brought before the Rajah, but re- |
sists his evefy blandishment. Soon Kadiniel ,
comes in aud reveals Medevah's plot to the |
Rajah, and the Rajah dies by Medevah’s |
treacherous knife. Medevah gloatingly tells |
Kadmiel how he will kill him and how his |
beloved Romena will be the slave girl of |
himself, the new Rajah. Kadmiel suddenly |
draws his knife and stabs the treacherous |
prime minister. Then he and his Romena}
flee from the Palace of blood to their form- |
er home in Christian lands. |

The acting of this play was unusually
well done. HH. K. Russell, who portrayed
Medevah, showed unusual power as he pre-
sented the fawning and scheming prime
minister of the Rajah, Susie Brady both
looked and played to perfection the role of
the Christian slave girl.

Ed, the professor's nephew, played by Al
Lake, comes in and reads from a newspaper
the startling information that many of the
beautiful women of the sultan’s harem are
to be turned. out because of the high cost
of living. The professor’s sympathies are
quickly aroused for these poor women. Soon
a knock is heard at the door and in walks
a feminine character who claims tobe Ha-
lide Khaled Zia Bey. A note which She
brings purports to be from Jack Allbright,
a former friend of the professor and at pres-
ent a member of a relief party in Turkey.
He asks the professor to care for this poor
woman as she has nowhere to go since bein-
sent away by the sultan. Numerous comic
situations arise in the horror of the profes-
sor at having a woman in his house and the #
delight of Ed at her loving nature. After | H
many laughs on the part of the audience, a
wig slips from the head of the supposed | #
female and she stands revealed as a col-| ii
legé student in the person of Jack Austin. | 6
The whole plan of Ed is then exposed and!
the anger of the'professor is finally subdued
and he is persuaded to forget his Helenic
culture long enough to enjoy a basketball
game with his nephew.
