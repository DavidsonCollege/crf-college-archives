Bible Study Rally:
Held Thursday Night

An Interesting Pregram Is Enjoyed
by Large Number.

The annual Bible study rally of the

Y. M. C. A. held last Thursday night
proved to be one of the most interest-
ing of such meetings held in recent
years. Asa result the outlook for a suc-
cessful year in Bible study is very prom-
ising.

Mr. C. W. Tillet, Jr., of Charlotte,
in presenting the cause, made a strong
and forceful plea to the students to en-
ter this work. He showed that a care-
ful study of the Bible would serve a
valuable purpose in all phases of life
and would develop character as nothing
else would. In addition to Mr. Tillett’s
address, the Student Body was favored
with an excellent musical program ren-

The moving pictures have been hailed
by many good people as an effective and
modern agency calculated to greatly as-
sist in education and healthy amusement.
It is a sad fact that every power for good

may be used for evil, and that seems to Spalding
be the present drift of the moving pic- Intercollegiate _

secular are the loudest in the cries
against the “menace of the movies.”
Everywhere the evil is growing, and pa-
rents and municipal authorities are
asleep. All are wide enough awake about
the physical menace of the infantile pa-
ralysis. For that cause, the movies are
closed to children. Why not close them,
because of the moral menace? Are the
bodies of men more important than their
spirits? Is physical paralysis any more
terrible than moral paralysis? Yet
there has been an increasing cry against
the fearful pollution. The Providence
Journal, in plain language, discusses the
subject and asserts that the movies per-
sistently stage rottenness which would
never have been allowed in the days of
the spoken plays. It goes on to say:

“A large proportion—perhaps eighty
per cent—of the films shown in this
country are of such a character that they
ought never to be displayed, particularly
to boys and girls in the most impression-
able period of life. They present crime
and lasciviousness under the thinnest
veneer or convention. They appeal to
the passions of those who gaze upon
them. They invite imitation. They put
dangerous or unclean thoughts into the
wholesome and unspoiled minds. They
work insidiously—and sometimes even
with startling frankness—to achieve
their improper ends. Conditions at
Providence are not substantially differ-
ent from conditions elsewhere. Any in-
formed and disinterested person will
testify to the rank and suggestiveness
and open vulgarity of much of the stuff
that is thrown on the screen in this city.
Millions of American citizens visit
movie houses every day. We cannot
afford to go on loosely and indefinitely,
indifferent to the menace. That it is a
menace is becoming plainer all the time.”

Surely the time for action, especially
on the part of Christians, has come.
They are commended to come out and
not to touch the unclean thing. If the
movies remain for the Church, they must
be purified —-The Presbyterian.

This is the one used in every big
college game, because it is the best
ball viewed from every standpoint.

Our foot ball line is complete in
everything needed for the player.

LINCOLN VS. SANTA CLAUS.

It was Lincoln's birthday and Miss
Nichols, the teacher, was giving a talk
on the hero of the day. Finally, one
little fellow asked anxiously: .

“Lincoln wasn't better than Santa
Claus, was he?”

“Santa Claus is good and so was Lin-
coln, There’s a great difference between
their sorts of goodness,” replied Miss
Nichols diplomatically.

“But, since Lincoln died, Santa Claus
has been the best man in the world,
hasn't he?” persisted Jimmy loyally.—
