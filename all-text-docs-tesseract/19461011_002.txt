clei To The
Editor...

Dear Editor:-

Though Eunice Bycupps is no BWOC at
Queen’s and I am no BMOC at Davidson, the
little publicity given to our union at the
Queen’s Square Dance seems to have caused
a small gap in the spiritual union of the two
schools,

The purpose of this letter is to rectify any
wrong which that article might have caused
and to make public my regard for the Queen
college of the south (the King college being,
of course, DAVIDSON). Please accept my
humble apologies, if you received any blows
from the girls (beautiful too!) upon your
visit last Saturday to their campus.

As is the usual custom in a letter of
apology, I shall try “to pass on the buck”.
I was told that I had to submit an article
to the Davidsonian before a certain time
Monday night and before yours truly had
time to grasp the horrible position in which
he was put, there were only two hours left
before the dead-line. As all students must

know, one has to grasp at the first subjec'
that pops into his head when put under such
a-stress. I did. However, my mind always
being. on girls, naturally I should jump on
Queen’s as my subject as that is the rumored
birthplace of Venus (I know - Botticelli put
her on the half shell).

As to the manner in which the column was
written, I have no excuse, except that in
order for anyone to date Eunice he must
have a great sense of humor. However, Eu-
nice has spurned me for Bill Cenjambre and
his bent Merdidies roadster. Hadies hath
no fury like a woman’s scorn — as the say-
ing goes.

patched with the putty of my apology.

COLUMN

By

JIM JACKSON

For the past week the David-
sonian office has been besieged with
frantic appeals from this year's
bumper crop of confused Freshmen.
The wise and friendly advice of
this column is sought by scores of
the perplexed and bewildered, Con-
sequently, future issues of “Robert
Rutherford” Sutton’s brainchild
will feature a guiding light for
those who find that they are un-
able to cope with the complex prob-
lems of campus and countryside
life.

One of the first questions comes
from a man whose problem is a
hangover from the mad stampede
of registration. This unfortunate’s
query reflects the confusion of
many:

Question: Dear—Counsellor, I’m
confused. When I got to the end
of that long line over in the gym
some funny looking old man gave
me a lot of white cards. What
can I do with them? Will you ex-
plore my mind? I can’t figure
out my schedule. I can’t make out
my schedule till I get a blue card.
I can’t get a blue card until I fill
out a pink card. I can’t fill ‘out
a pink card until I know what my
schedule is. Well?

Answer: See Mr. Hengeveld. He
doesn’t have very much to do and
can probably arrange to give you
crip courses that.meet on the first
floor on Tuesdays. Or better still,
forget those cards. They're just

printed to confuse you more, as-
suming the possibility of such in-
tent.

Question: Dear Counsellor, I’m
confused.. My eleven roommates
like to play bridge. I don’t know

how. I just like to eat. What can
I do?
Answer: Go ahead and eat. Eat

ycur heart out. Anybody can learn
how to play bridge. It takes a can-
n‘bal to throw up a hand,
Question: Dear Counsellor, I’m
confused. Why can’t I keep my
pet in my room? We've never been
separated. Sometimes people can’t
tell us apart. If I send him home
to Texas my keeper says he’ll shoot
him. Why don’t people like him.
Answer: Don’t worry. Davidson
isn’t cold-and heartless. You can
always put him back in Rumple.
He’ll find many friends there.
The state of South Carolina levies
a tax of twenty-five cents on every
ton of fertilizer sold in the state.
This tax is known as_the Fertilizer
Tax. It is used to support Clem-
son College. This is no reflection
upon the students. But there must
be a moral behind it, a printable
moral that is. Perhaps you can
suggest one, Send your sugges-
tions to the editor of The Tiger.
One more question has arisen.
How did “Bone” Jeffries” get his
nickname? Harvey Carrow (Wal-
ter Pidgeon, Jr.) can offer a color-
ful answer to this question.

“Centennial Summer”

Rich technicolor and good humor
together with Jerome Kern’s music
and the romance element make this
a very colorful movie. Such stars
as Jeanne Crain, Cornel Wild, Linda
Darnell, Constance Bennett and
Walter Brennan head the cast. A
very pleasing light musical comedy
and recommended to everyone,

October 14-15
“Caesar and Cleopatra”

Another spectacular technicolor
producti®mieagain emanates from
our own Hollywood. “Caesar and
Cleopatra” by George Bernard
Shaw stars Vivien Leigh and Claude
Rains in the title roles. Miss Leigh,
though no one doubts her beauty
and ability to be feline, fails to
render enough depth to her charac-
terization which will lead the movie
goer to believe that she will soon
ascend the throne of Egypt and for
posterity take her place along side
of Helen of Troy. But the Rains
came, Claude Rains seems to fail
in his portrayal of the great Caesar

in the fact that he lacks the mili-
tary bearing which we associate
with that conqueror, However let
us not overlook the brilliant dia-
logue of Mr. Shaw nor the several
million dollars worth of technicol-
ored Egypt. Historically speaking
and using a very literal sense of
the phrase, Caesar and Cleopatra
lived together.

“Perilous Holiday”

As to the information concern-
ing this motion picture, your re-
porter spent a perilous afternoon
in the files of the library trying
his best to find a write-up about
it, but try though he did, nothing
was accomplished. However, judg-
ing from the fact that Pat O’Brien
is the star and the title is “Peril-
ous Holiday,” this critic, if he may
be so called, recommends the
movie as a rip-snorting thriller for
a quiet day at Davidson.

Note: There will be matinees
at the Davidson Theatre on the fol-
lowing days for your convenience
providing there are no conflicting
lab. courses: Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

Outside of the Wildcats, things
were moving rather slowly in the
Piedmont vicinity this past week
end. Besides, with Sutton at the

r pinnacle of popularity and success,

we hesitate to clutter up his spot-
less rage-with cuttings from the
dead ducks on the “table.” . There
were some deals however, that sim-
ply can’t pass in the type. For
instance: :

GEORGE “HARKEY” ENNETT,
the Montreat Mouser, ambled up
Raleigh way to see to it that Ten-
nessee beat Duke and that the Sig-
mas got that new furniture they've
been angling for, To add insult to
injury, he bulled the bell boy into
putting it into the car for him:
(Note: Said furniture will be on
display at the Sigma house all next
week. See ENNETT for tickets.)

Dayidson’s own, the ALPHA SIG
chapter of the KKK, was reported
burning their weekly fiery cross
in the vicinity of Mt. Mourne C. C.

KAPPA SIGMA

Delta Chapter broke with its old
name “Limber” this week end and
sallied forth to initiate a fine and
festive season of deals.

Brothers Amos, Williams, and
Currie, alias the moose, the nose,
and the foots, respectively, took in
a large deal at the Mt. Mourne
Country Club. They were fortunate
to make it back for vespers. Broth-
ers Peters, White, and Ellis went
to see their respective Babies after
the big game in Charlotte. Speak-
ing of the game, we were mighty
proud of game captain Cheek, and
Rice, Bingham, Williams, and Mc-
Arn in our big victory. We were
also well represented atthe game
by Brothers Bryan and Powell who
escorted the beauty queens Miss
Asheville and Miss Nashville.

Brother Thompson, Little Swack,
had his Winston cutie down for the
week end, while Walker went to
Columbia to see his.

The remainder of the Chapter
were to be seen at fleeting moments
in Charlotte, rushing to the game,
dashing out of the Tavern, making
for the Bamboo, and falling back
to Davidson.

SIGMA PHI EPSILON

Epsilon Chapter of Sigma Phi
Epsilon opened what appears to be
a banner year with 37 actives on
hand, many. of them recently dis-
charged from the armed forces,

Brother Charlie Thompson, 1946
alumnus, accompanied several of
the fellows to the Wofford game in
that super de luxe Buick of his.
Glad to see him around. Last week
the fraternity held initiation and
four men were taken into the chap-
ter. They were Carlyle Moore, Bill
Plonk, Ed Watt, and Ed Coffin.
Plonk returned after about two
‘years in service as did Watt. Cof-
fin and Moore were pledges of the
summer session,

Extensive plans are being laid
for a banquet before the Friday
dance of Homecoming at which
time more than a hundred persons
are expected for the festivities.

PHI GAMMA DELTA

Egged on by frustrating years
in the United States armed forces,
Brothers Ragan and Snodgrass
joined army and naval training in
attacking so many women over the
week end that the operation was
immortalized in a more earthly sec-
tion of the current Davidsonian
(page 2, col. 5). As reported, they
staged a contest to determine who
would win the title of Most Extens-
ive Operator. Saturday morning
Snodgrass reported hopefully that
he expected to come out on top.

A study of existing socialogic and
economic conditions in the area of

the Southern States Fair, has been

inaugurated by the McKeithans, L.
and M. Questioned as to the pur-
pose of the work, Murdock explain-
ed, “After exhaustive, first-hand
study of European fairs undertaken
while spending some time on the
continent, we are determined to
uncover every possibility of fun, no
matter how low.” As an example
of the fine time to be had by all,
Leighton B. quéted the following
anecdote: Mother: “I'd like to buy
some gloves for my daughter.”
Salesman: “White kid?” Mother:
“Egad, Sir!”

Sunday night Fijis held a feed
at the house in honor of Mrs.
Campbell to express the chapter’s
thanks for her invaluable aid in
preparing food during rush week.
Highlight of the evening was the
dedication of a new verse of Old
Time Religion entitled, “Made a
Fireplug out of Fairly” to Brother
John L.

SIGMA-ALPHA EPSILON

Many members of the fraternity
journeyed: to the Queen City last
week end to witness the contest in
Memorial Stadium. Attending the
game were many guests of SAE in-
cluding Mrs. A. T. Port and Miss
Betsy Lang of Winston-Salem; Miss
Betty Yost, Mr. and Mrs.. J. W.
McAllister, Miss Watty McAllister,
and Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery Hill,
all of Greensboro, Pledge Bobby
Carson and Brother Dick Port an-
nounced the first and second halves
of the game, respectively.

Pledge Gil White and Brother Jim
McDonald went to Columbia to see
the S. C.-Alabama game. Brother
George Grimball attended the
Clemson-State game. John McAl-
lister and Ford Little traveled to
Greensboro after the game in Char-
lotte. Dick Port and his mother
left for Winston after the game.
Attending the game were Brothers
Powell, Patterson, Purcifull, Mc-
Gehee, Williams, Cambrell, Cod-
dington, Engle, Harris, Hatch, and
Pledges Faison, Kerr, Rodgers,
Carson, Hemby, B. Little, R. Little,
Warren, Cloaninger, V. McAllister,
and Sample.

Sunday night after vespers the
SAEs held an open house during
which refreshments were served.
Members of the faculty included
Dr, J. M. Douglass, Professor E.
J. Erwin, and Dr. John McConnell.
Also present were Brother Bill
Wood, class of ’43, Mrs. Junie Guy,
Mrs, Earle Bethea, and Mrs, Gene
Eskey.

Mrs. Bert Anderson and little
Judge were welcomed back after
being away for some time.
