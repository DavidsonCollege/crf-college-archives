The Davidson-Guilford game will go
down in history as the first intercol-
legiate game of the biggest year football
has ever had. So far as can be learned
no other college has attempted a schedule
game this early in the season. Accord-
ing to the theory that the early bird gets
the worm we've got the jump on every-
thing in this section.

The following games are scheduled
for this week:

Sept. 25—Davidson vs. Wake Forest
at Wake Forest, N. C.

Sept. 27—North Carolina A. and E.
vs. Guilford at West Raleigh, N. C.

Sept. 27—-Georgia Tech vs. Furman
at Atlanta, Ga.

Sept. 27—V. M. I.
Sidney at Lexington, Va.

Sept. 27—Clemson vs. Erskine at
Clemson.

vs. Hampden

“Monk” Younger, known above the
Mason Dixon line as the “Southern
Hyena” and one of the most brilliant
ends the South has seen in a long time
is this year coaching Hampden Sidney
team. “Monk” distinguished himself at
Davidson during the 1915-16 term by
making a letter on four different teams.
He has on hand ac Hampden Sidney a
big bunch from last year's squad and a
lot of good new material. Their season is
formally opened on Sept. 27, when they
meet V, M. I. in Lexington.

West Virginia is boasting of having
twenty seven regulars to draw from. If
this is only half true, the scrap that takes
place on Forbes field on October 11,
when they tackle Pittsburgh will be re-
membered long after Chateau Thierry
and St. Michiel have faded into oblivion.

Glenn Warner, the famous Pitt coach,
is grieving over the lost of two of his
stars of last year, although nine men out
of his first string eleven were back. on the
job. He has two full sets of backs known
as the “Flying Squadron” and the “Rock
Crushers,” either of which he claims can
score on any team in this country.

Washington and Lee began practice
last week with a squad of seventy out the
first day. Coach Roftery is working
hard preparing them for the first game
with Randolph Macon on October 4.
Among other veterans back are Pike
Johnston, Lindsey Moore, and Art
Cromwell of the 1916 team, besides Ed
Bailey and captain Bethel of last years
squad,

Coach Coleman of the University of
Virginia is being assisted this year by
“Robby” Gooch who is helping with the
backfield. “ Billy” Gooch his brother,

is also acting as one of the assistant] .

coaches. Coleman is giving mist of
his personal attention to the line which
with the exception of McGowan and
Wood will be composed almost entirely
of new men.

Georgia Teck is welcoming the return
of Brainard Adams who though a fresh-
man last year tore things up like an old-
timer, It is claimed by their boosters
that both he and “Buck” Flowers are
heavier and faster than before, and if so
they have a pair of backs that are hard to
beat. Hersman has cut the varsity
squad to thirty-seven men in order that
they might have more individual atten-
tion.

Bill—“]_ saw a woman hung. yester-
day.

Tom—"“Where?”

Bill—“‘Around her lover’s neck.”

Forest to Be
Our Next Foe

Game Friday at Wake Forest...

“On to Wake Forest.” ‘This is the’
next battle for the Wildcats. Playing
her second game of the season, David-
son will buck up against the Baptists
Thursday, Sept. 25. The old rivals
have not met in two years and the over-
whelming Davidson victory of 1917,
when she defeated Wake Forest by the
score of 72 to 7, is still burning in the
hearts of the losers. All this goes to
prove that the game ‘Vhursday will not
be lacking in fight and plenty of it.

After three weeks of gruelling prac-
tice, and a few hard scrimmages, Wake
Forest is ready to cpen up with every-
thing she has and surprises may not be
taken too light. The Baptist’s line is
strong and up to its standard, but the
aggressiveness ,and offense lies in the
backfield and there is where the main
trouble will lie for Davidson. Captain
Robenhorst is running wild through the
scrub line for consistent gains and this
is the man that the Red and Black line
must watch. Fulton also is hitting the
line hard.

However, with that reliable David:
son line from tackle to tackle consisting
at present of Hammit, Romfelt, Brady,
La Far and McMaster, the sailing does
not seem to be so easy for the speedy
Wake Forest backfield. There is a line
that will uphold the cilor$ of Red and.
Black without a flinch and it is going to
take the combination of a heavy line and :
fast backfield to get through it. With
Douglas and Miley on ends, the Baptists ,
will find little use of their trick forward
pass plays which it seems as if they are
especially proficient in this year, Pruette,
fleet Wake Forest warrior, is the man:
the Wildcat ends must cut down to;
break up these passes. . :

Henry Spann, crack quarterback will
be back in the game ‘Thursday, and this.
will not necessitate a shift in the back-
field as was the case in the Guilford
game. Black, Cassel and McAlister
will be at the halfbacks and Shepherd at
fullback.

The whole student body will turn out
to sée the team off as it leaves to play its
second game, Get down to the station
with plenty of “PEP.”

The affirmative, upheld by J.P.
Price, A. M. Mitchell and J. C. Bailey,
brought out the following points: First,
all other methods have failed; second,
there must be a league; third, it must

offer no better plan. The gentlemen
developed these points in such a way that
they won the decision.

The negative, upheld by J. C. Mc-
Caskill, R. L. ‘T. Liston and W. P.
Cummings, argued: First, that the
league has a tendency to violate Ameri-
can supremacy in Western Hemisphere;
second, the league is violated in spirit
by European nations; third, a league
without amendments is not necessary.

All the contests in the society have
heretofore been coming in the spring.
Some members think that it would be
advisable to have at least one of these
contests in the fall. The president
brought this matter up before the society |
and there was some discussion but noth-

FANCY GROCERIES
and

FRESH MEATS
A SPECIALTY

The first regular meeting of the Phil-
anthropic Literary Society for this year
took place last Saturday night. As on
the week previous, the meeting was given
over to the initiation of new members.
If the year’s work of the society can be
judged by the first meeting, the society
is assured of a successful year, for the
program was a good one, coming up to
all expectations.

The subject of the debate was: “Re-
solved, “That the League of Nations
Should Be Adopted Without Amend-
ments by the United States.” The af-
firmative side was upheld by J. C. Wool
and McLeod, who argued that the
“League” was a good thing and would
work as supposed to. The negative.
represented by A. L. Wilson and C. G.
Long, contended that the “League” was
a bad thing in its present form and
would defeat the very purpose — for
which it was formed. The judges be-
lieved that the bulk of the argument
was on the negative as was evidenced by
a unanimous decision.

The society was next entertained
with a declamation by F. L. Brown.

Thisdoubie breasted model is rather ex-
treme, becoming only to certain young
men, but there is‘a number of men in
