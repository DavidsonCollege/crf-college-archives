Campbell awarded Rhodes

By Manpy Curtis

After sitting in a room, dis-
cussing every article in The New
York Times, making paper hats with
the newspaper, and reading poetry
aloud with 12 other Rhodes Schol-
arship finalists for four hours Sat-
urday, senior political science ma-
jor Letitia Campbell first heard she
was awarded a Rhodes Scholar-
ship.

Davidson’s
timeless
tradition
takes a
twist

Nearly 700 expectant pairs of"

eyes were fixed on Chambers’ roof-
top Tuesday evening, as a spot-
light cut through the darkness, illu-
minating the form of a mysterious
red-suited character with a snow-
white beard peering down from
above the third story. But as he
swung his round belly over the
rooftop ledge, the strange fellow’s
identity soon became clear.

To the tune of “Santa Claus is
Coming to Town,” Davidson’s own
Santa repelled down the face of
one of Chambers’ distinctive col-
umns.

The mass of candle-bearing
students gathered on the lawn be-

Program, to Malawi as a Stuart
Scholar, and to China as a Presby-
terian Church delegate to the Fourth
World Conference on Women held

grant she will travel to Prague todo
research this summer. In the fall,
she will begin her two to three
years study at Oxford University,
England, in the School of Politics,
Economics, and Philosophy.
Campbell, this year, is one of
four from her region, one of 32

nationwide, and one of 75 world-
wide to re-
‘ceive a
Rhodes
Scholar-
ship, one
of the most
presti-
gious
graduate
scholar-
shipsinthe
world. Nominated as one of two
representatives from herhome state

of Alabama, Campbell went on to
the district level interviews in
Houston, Texas. Of the 12 nomi-
nees from the “Gulf District” in-
cluding Alabama, Arkansas, Loui-
siana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and
Texas, she and three others were
announced recipients.

Campbell becomes the 22nd
Rhodes Scholar from Davidson and
is the first from Davidson since
1983, when Hunter Monroe re-
ceived the award. Other Rhodes
Scholars from Davidson have in-

cluded late Secretary of State Dean
Ruskin 1930, former CEO of Time
Magazine Jason McManus in 1958,
and Elizabeth Kiss in 1982.
Away from Davidson for a
month at the start of the semesterto

RLO no longer moving sophomores

“It took a semester to get where | am now. | don’t want to start over.”

By JOANNA JOHNSON
& JASON McMULLAN ze
Asst. News Editor & Staff Writer

Last Friday night, Davidson’s
first and only co-ed hall received
some troubling news in a letter
from RLO — the male half of the
hall had to move due to the number
of women returning in the Spring.
Butaftera series of meetings, these
residents learned that they wouln’t
have to move after all.

Each semester, RLO hopes the
number of students leaving cam-
pus will closely match the number
of students coming back to live on
campus. According to Director of
Residence Life Kurt Holmes, stu-
dents wait until the last minute to
tell RLO of their plans to go abroad,
which forces RLO to quickly fig-
ure out housing assignments for
the next semester.

Holmes states that the task is
always difficult, but this year

proved to be especially frustrating.

“We track our rumor list dog-
gedly,” Holmes states, “and usu-
ally the numbers come up close,
except for this year.”

Holmes explains that this is an
“odd year” in terms of trying to
figure out housing because an un-
usually high number of women are
returning in the Spring. According
to Holmes, when RLO discovered
that they would be 20 beds short
for women this Spring, they thought

that moving the eight men off of
First Akers would be a good solu-
tion to securing rooms for return-
ing women.

For one, the hall represented
the highest percentage of students
already leaving second semester.
As Holmes states, there would be
“the least number of movements
for the best available space.”

Inaddition, there were already
four vacant rooms in dorms up the
hill, meaning that these eight resi-

dents could relocate in their room-
mate pairs.

In a meeting with First Akers
residents and Kurt Holmes, the
sophomores expressed frustration
notonly because RLO wanted them
to move but because they were
expected to move during finals.
Some thought that the decision re-
flected a desire to abolish the co-ed
hall, which they felt was unjusti-
