EVERYBODY CASTS A VOTE

Leading off with the election of
student body officers next week,
what is probably the most interest-
ing time of the year will have be-
gun—the time when leaders for
another year shall be chosen; the
time when aspiring upperclassmen
shall have their hopes and ambi-
tions crystallized or shall be thrust
into the discard; this procedure wil
be in order,

This most exciting period, for
some, always calls for the same de-
gree of indifference on the part of
others. Why students will not make
the necessary effort required in plac-
ing one’s ballot in the proper box
upon leaving the Chapel is strange,
to say the least. Indeed, it is piti-
able.

A second feature which might be
altered with profit is the matter of
placing nominations before the elec-
torate. Many times there are names
hefore students, especially is this
true of freshmen, that are nothing
more than names. If the nomina-
tions were announced and placed
before the student body for perhaps
three days, there would’be a suffi-
cient time for investigation.

There are many men who are en-
titled to vote in student body elec-
tions who do not attend chapel and
who are, therefore, unable to make
their preference known, Cannot a
central voting place be established
where those who have not voted at
chapel time may place their ballots ?

These suggestions, then:

1." The establishment of a cen-
tral voting place to be maintained
for several hours where everyone
may have opportunity to vote.

2. jouncement of nomina-
tions at least three days preced-
ing election.

3. Everybody casts a vote in
every election.

LET THE. FRESHMEN WEAR
RINGS

No, we don't mean that, but really
first year men might as well be given
the privilege of wearing their class
rings as sophomores and juniors.

This point of class rings, highly
protected as an honor which only
those who shall graduate shall have
at other institutions, is given no at-
tention whatsoever here. It’s a

" question of whether the students of
college want men wearing rings
which signify them as recipients of

“degrees when, in many instances,
they will not finish their college
work,

There are various rules as to
when a student may buy his class
ring, the best of which seems to us
to be the following: Students may
have the privilege of buying class

rings when reports from the Regis-,
‘trar’s office. show them as having

THE DAVIDSONIAN

March 7, 1929.

If anybody has any inclination to-
ward .expression about this matter,
the Open Forum column, starving
in recent issues, will welcome letters.

BROADENING SYMPATHIES

That world peace will be realized
not by a passive assent and an inac-
tive endorsement by the citizenship
but by “taking a practical part in
supporting all useful international
undertakings” is the opinion of
Herbert Hoover as expressed in his
inaugural address. He points out
the fact of “youth pressing more and
more into our institutions of learn-
ing; that our people are seeking a
larger vision through art, literature
science and travel; that they are
moving toward stronger moral and

. | spiritual life—that from these things

our sympathies are broadening he-
yond the bounds of our nation and
race toward their true expression in
a real brotherhood of man.”

Such a reaching out into strange
and unexplored fields must neces-
sarily bring about a more definite un-
derstanding of the probems of other
peoples. The student mind will be
quick to grasp the attitude of the
foreigner suffering from past wars
upon reflection and he will realize
that there is a distinction that is keen
hetween himself and those who were
more affected by the recent conflict
than was he.

The younger generation in Eu-
rope is overshadowed by the’ possi-
hility of future wars. Many of the
younger men are filled with a feel-
ing of utter futility. They feel they
are under sentence of death, and
that creative effort in those circum-
stances is worthless. :

Strikingly different is the Ameri-
can student's attitude. © This coun-
try thought it suffered during the
World War, but its sacrifices are
entirely incomparable to the Euro-
pean holocaust. Even though the
battlefields have been cleared there
still remain great clouds of smoke
hanging low to fill the hearts of
European youth with a secret fear
that the gruesome episode may he
tepeated.,

Fortunate American youth has no
such black tragedy to haunt it while
it is working toward higher ideals
and realizing unspeakable business
and economic progress. But in this
prosperity they should not forget
those very simliar young men and
women arcoss the sea, laboring’ with-
out privilege or encouragement,
working with no promised future,
offered only death in a bloody strug-
gle of nations by destiny. They
must strive to obliterate all sem-
hlance of further military oppres-
sion until, without thought of nation
or race, there shall be the knowledge
that life is secure, that war is no:
more, and that opportunity awaits
ach without discrimination,

CHALLENGE!

The next two or three years are
going to witness the most critical
time in Davidson's history, For
many years the college has been in
a process of building and founda-
tion-laying. In fact, since its found-
ing, the forward strides of the insti-
tution have been convincing. Now,
however, there is a new period in
the immediate offing. Times have
changed in methods of college oper-
ation as well as in business, profes-
sions, and industry, and Davidson
is doing her part toward meeting
this spirit of the New Age.

With Chambers Building rearing
its dome to a finish, a material sym-
hol of the college’s new life is in
evidence, The massive structure
carries in it the very essence of Da-
vidson’s ideals and hopes. It is a
tribute to all the men who have com-
pleted their courses here, and a hea-
con of light to all’ who will walk
these halls in the future. The ath-
letics of the college are on the up-
grade after a period of varying suc-
cess, and indications are that the
whole system of athletic training will
soon embark on a firmer basis than

Cosmic Chaos
By J. W. McCutchan

Collegiate Quips

Admirers of that excellent explorer
and gentleman, Roald Amundsen have
never ceased to wonder as to his fate.
It will be remembered that he was one
of a party to search for the Nobile
crew. Nobile was found, though most
of his crew and Amundsen were not.
Recently in Rome, the examining
board severely condemned General No-
bile for his conduct in the affair. In
disgrace he must now answer ques-
tions as to why he abandoned a. part
of the crew of the Italia, allowing him-
self to be carried to safety. A cap-
tain must be the last to leave his ship,
a leader should be the last to desert his
expedition. Yet psychologists will tell
us that Nobile only adhered to the in-
stinct of self-preservation.  Bestial
traits!

Another revolution is in progress in
Mexico, This time it is bloodless. The
Mexicans appear to be progressing in
the art of scientific and classic revolt.
Several states have quietly captured
or bribed the Federal troops, along
with their arms and arsenals. It is
hoped also that the United States, thus
far having refrained from sending
Marines there to control military tac-
tics, will also overlook the possible
entanglements in which our diplomats
could become fast.

For the first time in many years,
Congress held an active legislative ses-
sion on Sunday. Movements by blue
law advocates to postpone the meeting
were overruled and defeated by a ma-
jority.. Reformers were more success-
ful in the Senate, however, and being
led by Senator Joe Robinson from
Arkansas, adjourned while making
protest against legislative use of the
Sabbath. The question, which will
trouble many honest souls is, was the
meeting a work of necessity or mercy?

Doctor William Bregory of the
American Musuem of Natural History
has recently removed the chief cause
of worry from the monkey's chest.
His recent book, Theory of the De-
velopment of Man From Fish, essays
to prove that the human is of pisca-
tory origin. We wonder if his main

arguments are the way many of us
look, and the manner in which we
take the bait. But let the coconut

theory take a back seat.

(Item of interest or otherwise ap-
pearing in the college press).

Mercer University: To quote,
“Probably the most revolutionary re-
form in the history of the school was
enacted—when the student body—
adopted measures to regulate the time
and manner of election of student of-
ficers.” This change, briefly sum-
marized, is: Open politics to a certain
degree not permitted lyefore, a certain-
day to be set apart as election day and
all candidates to be voted upon at that
time, this change will include all elec-
tive positions within the student body,
a committee to be. appointed, of fac-
ulty members and students, to govern
the election, voters registration lists to
be used, and also a preferential ballot
substituted for the odd scraps of pa-
per. Of peculiar interest is the state-
ment, “Only 35 students attended the
meeting, but, since the student body
has no definite organization, this num-
ber constituted a quorum.”

The Daily Lariat of Baylor Univer-
sity, calls attention to the fact, in a
recent edition of that publication that
those who make the best grades are
not always the same types of persons.
We read: Two married women who
make biscuits and beds after school
hours, a freshman who commutes
twice daily to Oklahoma City, and a
wearer of a Phi Beta Kappa key who
dates and plays bridge too—such in
cross-section are some of the lives of
the nine students who received straight
“A” scholarship averages last sem-
ester.

Editors of the Chameleon staff need
not feel'so very bad over the review
which assailed the last)issue of their
publication. They are not alone. The
“Richmond Collegian,” of Richmond
University comes out with the head-
lines, “‘February Messenger Should |
Have .Been Drowned in its Early
Youth’—Reviewer.” He continues:
“T again find myself crouching fool-
ishly at my father’s typewriter—this
time to review, criticize, and slam the
last issue of our own Messenger. Let
me say before the tongues have wag-
ged too far that patriotism alone ac-
counts for this bit; the editor asked
me—not I the editor.” »And the gent-
leman proceeds with his damning bus-
iness,

OPEN FORUM

THE IMMINENT
CLIMACTERIC

Dear Mr. Editor:

During my four years at Davidson
I have ridden over eight thousand and
six hundred miles, exclusive of a trip
to New York and intermediate points,
at the expense of accommodating
motorists—mostly to and from home.
Being a student of moderate means,
this saving of around $322.50 (3 3-4c
per mile—current railroad rates) has
aided me in remaining in college and
has made possible trips which I could
not have made at my own expense.
Many boys have covered a far greater
mileage and hence, realized a greater
saving. With four years of medicine
ahead of me I wish to cover some 15,-
000 miles more by the aid of the friend-
ly motorist. It does not require ex-
cogitation to see that the friendly
motorist is a real philanthropist tothe
student who must meet his expenses
without his father’s checkbook.

But, the passage of laws in some
states prohibiting a motorist from
picking’ a person up on the public
highway, the vote of the Carolina

of accomplishment—a time when
the name of the college is being em-
blazoned deep on the ‘scroll of the
future.

In view of such a glorious pros-
pect, can any Davidson man fail to
catch and take to himself the notes
of personal challenge which ring
through the whole system of college
life? Can any man fail to make the
resolution to cast his best efforts in-

After discussing the matter with a
number of students and motorists, I
Propose that the Students’ Store ob-
tain cards with something like the
following printed on the face thereof:

“In profound appreciation of your
indulgence, I hereby waive any statute,
stipulation, prerogative or privilege
which might otherwise be pleaded by
me against the owner, driver, occu-
pants or any other person in case of
accident or injury while riding in this
velicleitin- Signed cease merece oe pisces

For the reverse side of the card, I
suggest something similar to the fol-
lowing:

“The person named on the face of
this card is a student in regular stand-
standing at Davidson College.”

Signed by the proper official.

Such cards may be secured for $1.85
per thousand. or less in larger quanti-
ties and sold"to the students at a very
small cost? They would, to my mind,
aid greatly in securing rides if pre-
sented to the accommodating motor-
ist. The idea would spread to other
colleges and soon a card would pay the
fare for any trip desired and the fear
of hold-ups, hoboes, damage suits, etc.,
would be dismissed from the mind of
the motorist.

It is not my purpose to renew any
fight anent bumming with the enemies
thereof, but merely to submit th
above for consideration. :

INTROSPECTION NEEDED

Indiana Daily Student: “School is
the bunk. I haven't learned a thing
useful to me since I’ve been here.”

The ‘above remark was made re-
cently by a junior student in the Uni-
versity, and is typical of the attitude
of a number of other students in the
University. Fortunately for the Uni-
versity, such students are greatly in the
minority. The remark brings out
certain significant characteristics, how-
ever, of some students who help to

make up the personnel of the student
body.

Students who feel this way about
school can blame no one but them-
selves for their failure to learn any-
thing. Abundant knowledge is here
if they would but seek it. Often, it is
true, little-can be learned solely from
attendance in classes, but much can
be learned by research work in the
Library. There, books of all de-
scriptions, containing highly interest-
ing and educational reading, can be
found. If a student so desires, he can
find- material enough on almost any
subject to make. himself thoroughly
famniliae with it.

about. “They lay the blame for this

In many cases, the student who com-
plains that school is the bunk is one
that can be found’ going to picture
shows in the afternoons ‘and nights, or
who can be found loafing with
“cronies” in various eating establish-
ments near the campus. He spends lit-
tle or no time in preparing lessons for
the next day, trusting that he will get
by without having to recite. He
ridicules other students who spend
time on their school work, and is al-
ways the first one to complain when
a term paper or a lengthy assignment
has. to be prepared. Naturally, with
this attitude, it is small wonder that
he and others of_his type fail in gain-
ing what they presumably desire, and
unless some change is made little hope
can be held that the desire for knowl-
edge ever will be completely filled—
