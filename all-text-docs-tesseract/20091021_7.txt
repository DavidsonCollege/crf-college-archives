ing Hits “A Night
With The ‘Cats”

It looks like Davidson College
has seen the last of its honored
tradition “A Night With the ‘Cats,”
the dance performances that high-
light the beginning of the men’s
and women’s basketball seasons.

On a jam-packed, festive night
that included tributes to Miley
Cyrus, Michael Jackson, Slumdog
Millionaire, rock n’ roll, Beyoncé
and even an enthusiastic President
Ross’s participation in the finale,
several problems arose.

“I am disgusted,” spat one
townie mother afterwards. “Those
could not have been the men’s and
women’s basketball teams; the
dancing was far too graphic and
professional. Those girls were gy-
rating and grinding as though they
were in a rap video! And the men
weren't any better — several groups
wore pants that were entirely too
tight and revealing. It was so vul-
gar, I had to cover my children’s
eyes! One group wore tattoos all
up and down their arms, while oth-
ers had dyed their hair pink! I must
say, these are not the kinds of role
models I expected my children to
find at Davidson.”

Another discrepancy is now be-
ing battled in medical court by one
basketball player whom, inflicted
with a severe concussion due to
a misstep in her dance, actually
passed out and vomited several
times due to exposure to the strobe
lights and overbearing sound
system at dress rehearsal and was
forced to participate despite her
condition.

ST Obama’ s Confession: eWorld:

2009

wide Recession Also A Hoax

Washington D.C.- Early Mon-
day morning President Barack
Obama announced in a White
House Press conference that the
global economic recession, just
like last week’s “Balloon Kid”
incident, has all been an elaborate
hoax.

“The global economic
recession has all been
an elaborate hoax.”

In light of the recent hype
surrounding the little boy said
to be floating across the Rock-
ies in a balloon, the Commander
in Chief decided it was time to
come clean about his own sophis-
ticated practical joke.

After nearly two years of eco-
nomic turmoil, Mr. Obama decid-
ed it was time to finally call it quits
on the laughs he had at the world’s
expense. He spoke confidently and
causally as he addressed the coun-
try from his playroom, formally the
Oval Office. Occasionally there
was a brief pause where he got dis-
tracted by the Lego set on his desk,
but Obama was mainly able to
stick to his heartfelt apology to the
United States and the world.

“My bad,” he nonchalantly
admitted. “I just thought it would
be pretty funny to convince people
they lost everything. In my experi-
ence as a public official I get no
better satisfaction than seeing my
constituents overreact to question-
able government policy. They’re
clueless! That’s funny to me.”

Mathematical pornography

“Surprise! Haha, fooled you!”
shouted Obama as he leapt out from
behind his desk in the Oval Office.

Obama’s confession is the
latest in a rash of presidential dis-
honesty. In his memoir, George
Bush admitted to rigging the 2000
election that put his son, George
W., in office. A new biography
argues that Ronald Reagan did
not, in fact, have Alzheimer’s, but
was simply bored with his job and
wanted to spend more time on his
bottlecap collection. When Bill
Clinton and Ms. Lewinski pulled
their famous prank on Hilary Clin-
ton, it nearly cost Bill the presi-
dency.

Obama was asked to comment
on whether he would enjoy be-
ing pranked in return. He turned
around and sharply replied, “No
one pranks me. I’m the f--king
President.”

Trash Talk

Davidson College highly val-
ues environmental sustainability
and cost-effective management.

One Dean who wishes to
remain anonymous conceded,
“We decided to send tuition bills
electronically this year to cut back
on postage costs and save trees.
Likewise, we are under a hiring
freeze and have eliminated some
of the maintenance staff to stretch
every penny.”

Yet when asked why tuition
has sky-rocketed despite the ma-
jor economic downturn, the Dean
was forced to concede huffily that
it “takes a lot of cash to build a
planetarium on the roof of the
president’s house and send all the
professors to Cancun each Winter

Break.”

This sustainability theme has
crept into the College Meal Plan
as well.

“You walk past the Union
Café tables now and all you see
are about a mile of buckets and
bins. You’ve got one for trash,
one for bottles, one for paper and
one just for composting. I mean,
do they really think that Davidson
intellectuals will take time from
pondering greater philosophical
questions to sort garbage?” ques-
tioned junior Bobby Owen.

According to a recent survey,
composting is the last thing on
any student’s mind. Ironically
enough, senior Rachel Connors
notes, “Before composting, the
Café gave away leftover food to
the homeless. But we can all take
comfort knowing it'll be properly
sorted and distributed to needy
worms and hippies.”

Major Disappointment:

Major: Mathematics

Reasons people choose this
major: Masochism, ambition

Why people avoid this major:

Life is worth living

Career options: Engineer, ac-
countant, actuary, physicist, hedge
fund manager, Wall Street mogul,
builder of time machine and other
jobs where there are extreme scar-
cities

Description: Math majors are
a strange breed. They get lost in a
world of 1+1=2 and triangles have
180 degrees. These people actu-
ally enjoy and/or are good at doing
math. They also grossly overesti-

mate the math skills of non-majors.

When math majors help non-
majors with their math homework,

The Yowl’s Handy Guide

majors assume laypeople under-
stand obscure and complicated
theorems and assume proficiency
in what we clearly don’t under-
stand (You don’t know what a de-
rivative is? Haven’t you ever seen
NUMB3RS?). Math majors get it
together. The whole point of tutor-
ing is because we don’t know what
the hell we should be doing.

Math majors are easily spotted
by their thick glasses, bad skin,
and mock turtlenecks. They have
an uncanny reverence for Pythago-
ras and rank well below physics
and chemistry majors in social
skills.

While these people are by all
accounts weird, we must respect
and befriend them as they will
likely be our bosses in the future.
