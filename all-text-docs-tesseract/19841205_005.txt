Anne Lambert

For the past year and a half I have
been involved in the Y Student Service
Corps in a variety of ways. Last year as
Publicity Coordinator and Community
Liason, I was responsible for creating the
Y-SSC bulletin board in Chambers, as
well as advertising the various activities
of the Y to students and the Davidson
community. My responsibilities as Sec-
retary have included not only the stan-
dard communications duties of letter-
writing and typing the Y newsletter, but
also working closely with the president
and vice-president to organize and carry
out projects such as Town Day, the Y-
SSC slide show and the Y brochure.

Although the majority of my involve-
ment has taken place on an adminisira-
tive level, I often have the opportunity to
participate in the individual programs,
helping to organize Hunger Awareness
Week and the CROP Walk and filling in
at the Day Care Center.

If elected, I hope to continue the pre-
sent growth of the Y as a viable campus
organization. I beieve that the current ad-
ministration worked to unite the various
Y-SSC projects under a service umbrella
that would provide a support group for
individuals and their programs. I saw the
Y grow in membership and campus rec-
ognition, partly due to my own efforts as
a Y officer. I want to strengthen the Y as
a cohesive organization, while continu-
ing to meet the service needs of the cam-
pus and community.

As president, I would hope to address
the immediate concern of the
Gethsemane Tutoring Program, which
will lose much of its funding next year,
and the possible alternatives to this pro-
gram. Through the acquisition of a tele-
phone and a typewriter for the new Y of-
fice in the Union, I hope to establish the
office as a service resource center within
the Davidson community and Mecklen-
burg County.

I want to increase campus participa-
tion even more by sponsoring more cam-
pus-wide social activities through the Y
such as parties, open retreats and service
projects, and leadership training for pro-
gram coordinators and participants. I
also see the need for an updated list of
specific community service needs and
suggested projects in the area that would
be distributed to eating houses and cam-
pus groups, thereby increasing direct
communication between the Y and the
other campus service leaders.

The role of the Y-SSC President is to
oversee all the individual service pro-
grams, targeting problem areas and sup-
porting the program coordinators in their
activities. The president is often called
upon to serve as spokesperson for the Y,
and is the representative who is most
often addressed by the community and
contacted with service needs. This elec-
tion, the first contested officer election in
more than ten years, attests to the in-
creased strength and validity of the or-
ganization. I am encouraged by my past
participation in the Y and excited by the
possibilities for next year. | would ap-
preciate your support on Tuesday.

Lambert, Reynolds Vie For Y-Student Service Corps Presidency

Dee Reynolds

The Y Student Service Corps plays
an important role in the lives of both
Davidson students and people outside the
campus. I wouldn't run for Y-SSC Presi-
dent if I didn’t think I could help it to
maintain the level of excellence it has
achieved during the past two years.

I bring to this opportunity to serve
Davidson's students and community a
familiarity with leadership responsibili-
ties and with the YSSC, but not a direct
involvement in past Y offices. As co-
chairperson of the Chapel Committee
this year, I have helped it to organize re-
ligious and service oriented activities for
the campus. I say helped because leader-
ship means more than directing people, it
means working side-by-side with them.
I’m also someone who has benefitted
from my involvement with the Y over the
past three years primarily in its Senior
Citizens and CROP programs. I know
what the Y does, but I’ve never served it
in a leadership capacity before.

The fresh perspective of an outsider
can be helpful though. I can come to the
Y without too many biases about “the
way things ahve always been done.” If
elected, I will have to talk to each pro-
gram coordinator individually about
their dreams and problems. I'll need to
visit each program in action. I am willing
to suggest changes if necessary, but I rec-
ognize that change for the sake of change

is bad.

There are certain goals which the Y
should not change. The Y should con-
tinue to seek an increased participation
by students. All of us are members of the
YSSC. We must continue to see the Y as
a training ground for lifetimes of service.
Learning to serve should be an integral
part of the “Davidson experience.” Most
importantly the Y must continue to be re-
sponsive to the needs of the students,
community, and world it serves.

The president cannot insure a suc-
cessful YSSC, but he or she can enable
it. Responsibility must be shared with the
vice-president and other officers, but ul-
timately it rests at top. Besides working
with the coordinators of the on-going
programs, the president and vice-presi-
dent help with special events. They serve
as liasons between community groups
like churches or charities and students
groups looking for service projects. They
organize Town Day each spring. The
President serves on various campus com-
mittees like the Chaplain’s Ecumenical
Council and represents the Y before the
Administration.

Most importantly, however, the
President must encourage. He must en-
courage officers and coordinators to take
their jobs seriously, but also to dream
dreams of a better Y. He must encourage
the community to let us help them. He
must encourage students to look outside
themselves to the needs of others. He
must also be willing to be encouraged by
others. Let me help you serve!

Reeves, deBeck And Dana Lemon
Seek Wildcat Handbook Editorship

Laurin de Beck And Alice Reeves

The Wildcat Handbook is most im-
portant and useful in easing the
freshmen’'s trasition into the Davidson
way of life. As editors of the Handbook
we believe that we can be of great help in
familiarizing the freshmen with David-
son. We realize the importance of the
Handbook to not only the freshmen, but
to everyone here on campus. We are
planning an exciting, different, and fun
handbook that will be filled with concise
and useful information.

We believe that as editors we are a
good combination of experience

(Laurin was editor and layout her high-
school literary magazine which won an
award in the Virginia High School league
competition, Alice serves as Vice- Presi-
dent of Warner Hall and is coordinator of
ail Freshmen Activities). We are both ar-
tistic and creative and have some won-
derful ideas for the handbook — and are
eager for anyone else's ideas.

We both will work hard to insure ev-
eryone will find the 1985-86 Wildcat
Handbook useful and informative. We
would appreciate your support on Tues-
day!
