My Little Girl...

i, my daughter, who is seven years
old, started to school as usual. She wore
a dark blue dress with a white collar. She
had on black shoes and‘wore blue gloves.
Her cocker-spaniel, whose name ts “Coot,”
sat on the front poreh aad whined his canine
belier in the folly of education as she waved
“good-bye” and started off to the halls of
learning. **

Tonight we talked about school. She told

me about the girtavho-sits in front oft-her—]-

—the girl with yellow curls—adnd the boy-
across the aisle who makes funny faces. She
told'me about her teacher, who has eyes in
the back of her head—and about.the trees

-in the school yard—and about the big: girl.

who doesn’t believe in Santa Claus. We
talked about a lot of things— tremendously
vital, unimportant things; and then we stud-
ied spelling, reading, arithmetic—and then
to bed. .

She’s back there now — back in the nur-
sery sound asleep, with “Princess Elizabeth”
(that’s .a doll) cuddléd in her right arm. You
guys wouldn’t hurt her, would you? You
see, I’m her daddy. When her doll is
broken or her finger is cut, or her head gets
bumped, I can fix it—but when she starts
to school, when she walks across the street,

———then she’s in your-hands.

She’s a nice kid. She can run like a deer
and darts about like a chipmunk. She likes.
