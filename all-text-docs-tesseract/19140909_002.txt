Chambers. A little colony of students
gathered at the college of which this
great building was the center, and with
the trees which were set up about it
then, grew up through the prpgress of
vears a number of college ways and col-
lege traditions. “Che college met the
war fearlessly and heroically, sending
some. of its best to the front, and when
it was over, bent its energies tuo the re-
construction of Christian education in

‘To this college of memorable and
proud past comes this year one hundred
and twenty new men. It would not be
natural if during the vears gone there
had not developed traditions peculiar to
Davidson. Some have been abolished as
useless and hurtful. But to the new
men who will soon all be our new
friends we would urge this word: When

A campus in the summer is lke a
heautiful corpse. “he buildings, the
halls, the trees, the walks, everything. ts
still there, stretched out over the cam-
pus in quiet repose, but the life is gone.
{t is the college, but not the college. It
is the same place, but aot the same place.
Me oiman can fail to notice it. Yet noth
ing could be more natural. We com-
monly say that the college makes men.
Mere buildings do not. A spacious,
green campus might be a delight to the
eve, but it lays no mighty grip upon a

‘elaborate equipment and fine campus.
When its pulse throbs with active, en-
thusiastic. purposeful men, then it is a
inaker and changer of men.

And <o not only does the college make
men. We are more than the lower tor-
mations of life, which respond instantly
to. very little influence, but exert none.
We wet, but we also give. Just as truly
as the college is making us, and shaving
our ideas and purposes, are we making
the colle’s, and determining what its
purpose chall be and what it shall stand
for. There is a continual influence both
ways.

Now that the campus has shaken off
its sumuner grave clothes, and the college
is alive once more, it cannot stand still.
It must move in some direction. The
‘trite. saving that a college is starting out
upon the bes vear of its history. has be-
come a joke, but the sentence has been
well-warn only because it should be well
true. Every year ought to be the best
to chat cime.

German generals as they are pressing
their soldiers toward Paris. “Vheir's is

have a beautiful campus, let us make it
more beautiful; we have a good student

good athletics, good literary work, a

Professors and students have noticed
a new teeling this year. There is more
earnestness, more purpose, more determi
nation to make evervthing count than
‘ever before. ‘Vhere is an air of hope-
fulness and courage with regard to every
phase of college work.

It behooves us to encourage this fine
spirit at the beginning. It should grow
dyring the year. We have constantly
talked in longing terms of the Davidson
dasses and Davidson teams and David-
son spirit that used to be once. The old
standard is good only as a mark bevoend
which to reach in the future. “Falk of
