Curtis Harper Notes
Change And Hopes

BY JOHN MOREFIELD
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Mr. Curtis Harper is a small, youngish man, a neat
and conservative dresser, with sincere eyes and voice,
and, incidentally, the new minister of the Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian Church. Harper is at present in the
process of adjusting to a new sort of experience for him,
that of being pastor of a church which is, ostensibly, very

closely related to a college.

“Its entirely different from
anything ['ve done. It's all new
to me.”

Harper is a Davidson man,
class of '50. From Davidson, he
went on to Union Seminary in
Richmond. For a time, he was a
Navy chaplain in the Philip-
pines, with the responsibility of
conducting five services a day
for sailors and Marines, in a
variety of structures from jun-
gle tents to abandoned Roma
Catholic churches. :

Asked if he found any ap-
preciable religious concious-
ness in servicemen at large,
Harper replied, quite frankly,
“Not much. Of course, | met
in the service some of the
most exemplary Christian
men I’ve ever met, and some
of the most devoted. But gen.
erally the men are not too

Special Film Fete
Features " Aurora’

“Aurora,” Davidson's first
serious attempt at film-making,
will be shown next week as part
of the Fine Arts Festival at the
College Union. This 35-minute
black and white sound film was
written, directed and filmed by
junior David Simpson at a cost
of $300.

The story of a young man

haunted by the dream of a love-
ly girl, “Aurora” has been in
the making about ten weeks. It
features Pat -Douglas as the
man, Dianne Harris’ as the
dream girl Aurora, and Stuart
Jamison as Pat's helpful friend.
The score was composed by Bill
Pruitt.
, The Experimental Film Festi-
val Tuesday and Wednesday will
feature “Inauguration of the
Pleasure Dome,” “Desistfilm,”
“Begone Dull Care,” “The
Cage,”
“Hoppity Pop,” and ‘Hurry,
Hurry.”

The Experimental Film Festi-
val has been set up to show the
type of work being done by
film-makers who have largely.
done away with plot lines and
put emphasis on the color, move-
ment and composition of the
film as an artistic medium.

The film schedule for the rest
of the semester includes a dou-
ble feature—“The Hustler” and
“Breakfast at Tiffany's.” Both
films were nominated for sev-
eral acting awards and “The
Hustler” was nominated for the
Academy Award as the Best Pic-
ture of the Year. “Viridiana”
is tentatively scheduled for May
7-9 and “Splendor in the Grass”
will complete the semester's
program.

“Flesh of Morning,” |

much interested in religion.”

Harper is married; his wife,
Betty Jo, he'met in high school
at their hometown of Lynch-
burg, Virginia. They have no
children.

At Davidson, Mr. Harper
played football. “At least till

. | got hurt,” he adds, with a

smile. He is still nominally
interested in sports. He finds
a little time for golf, and “t
swim up in the gym for about
fifteen minutes a day, just
for the exercise.”

Has Davidson changed appre-
ciably since he was here?

“Yes. I find a more cosmo-
politan, critical spirit now. Stud-
ents certainly question more,
because they are generally of
higher quality and intelligence
now, due to more rigid entrance
requirements." He sipped an
icy coke for a moment, then
added reflectively, “Of course,
responsibility has increased at
the same time. And this is
good.”

When asked about the re-
sponsibilities he faced as pas-
tor of a “combination” town
and college church, Mr. Harper
replied in positive terms.

“4 feel committed greatly to
the: pastoral ministry. | mean
by this that ! intend to ful-
full the pastor's duties of
visiting the sick and the poor
te as great en extent as | am
able. | also hope for a good
relationship with the stud-
ents.”

As the informal interview
drew to a close, Mr. Harper
added with sincerity, “I have a
hope that in this congregation
we ean transcend the bounds
between town and college, be-
tween the various natural group-
ings in the community—towns-
people, faculty, students—in
some sort of meaningful rela-
tionship.” One would hope that
he succeeds.

and (2) that the resolution does
not show a tendency to slacken
the punishment for honor of-
fenders.

Burts said, ‘Three years ago,
there was no expectation of re-
admission to Davidson after dis-
missal for an honor offense. The
offender simply went the other
way and kept on going. Some of
the faculty are concerned that
this may progress, the penalties
becoming increasingly lighter.
As of now, the faculty hopes
that this is not just one in a
series.”

HUMANITIES

If the new Humanities course,
‘which begins next year is elect-
ed by a student, it must be be-
gun in the Freshman year and
be continued through the Sopho-
more year. It is an inter-disci-
plinary course which enables a
student to fulfill in two years
the following requirements for

graduation: six hours in history,
the entire requirement; nine
hours of the required twelve in
English; and nine hours of the
twelve required in Bible and
religion.

Instruction will be by general
lectures to the entire group of
students, frequent discussion
sessions in small groups, and
individual conferences with in
structors. Stress will’ be laid
upon effective communication
in oral and written English; a
number of written reports and
papers will be required.

STAFF NAMED

The teaching staff for the first
year of the course consists of a
team of six representatives of
the disciplines interrelated in
the course; Professors Rhodes
and Polley (Bible and Religion),
Professor lLabban (Classics),
Professor Cole (English), Pro-
fessor McGeachy (History), and
Professor Abernethy (Philoso-
phy). , ,

Enrollment for the year 1962-
1963 will be limited to 100 fresh-
men,

Experimental Films Prove
New Emotion Experience

BY BILL TROTTER
Davidsonisn Fine Arts Critic

Men in sweatshirts sitting around ‘a’ beer-laden table, scratching, sweating, pick-
ing their teeth — you can almost smell them; they are playing poker with out-
sized arid ridiculous cards — in an instant they are snarling and fighting, jerkily,
savagely, while the overhead light swings and reveals their animal tearing and goug-
ing in shafts of hap-hazard light . . . This is the scene from the powerful and beauti-
fully composed film, Texture of Decay one of the experimental films brought to the

college this month as part of

Oreative efforts as diverse
as these may not be lumped to-
gether in a body by a reviewer.
But several things stand out
about the films as a whole. They
are art, as valid and as legiti-
mate as any other art. They
knock the viewer off base, force
him to feel as much as see
images which may repell, thrill,
frighten, mystify.

A program of them, especial-
ly one as well chosen as the
cufrent one, becomes a real
experience in emotion. Visually
they have an almost stunning
impact. Beyond generalizations
like these, the individual films
must speak for themselves.

IMAGES USED

_The first film, Begone Dull
Care, utilized images painted di-
rectly on to the film itself, and
somehow synchronized with
fantastic precision to a jazz
sound track. This blend of
music and film is nothing new;
Walt Disney and Stokowski did
it to Bach in Fantasia, but the
effects of the style seem infin-
ite.

It was like being caught in a
Jackson Pollock painting, of
suddenly waking into a world
like a third grader’s tempra
splashes—where color and
blocks of images take the place
of reality. Lines and vaprous
points shift and heave to frisky
music. The title is appropriate,
for the film has a feeling of wit
and zany joy which infects the
viewer.

WASTED FILM

A good example of wasted
film was the next item, Psyche,
a hodge-podge of abstruse classi-
cal and modern sets and moods,
telling nothing, showing almost
nothing. The people were alter-
nately ugly and too sharply
beautiful; the wiman in the
“title role’ was rather monoli-
thic-looking and scemed embar-
rassed to be where she was.

Even worse was the crude and
naive Mechanics of Love, where
coitus was represented by such
uplifting symbols as a cactus, a
dripping faucet, a madly stitch-
ing sewing machine, and a flam-
ing stove, If it hadn’t been so
laughable, it would have been
offensive—not to the viewer’s
morals, but to his mentality.

WEIRD FILMS

Far superior was the exquisite
Virapuru which captured the
dark and racial feeling of primi-
tive man in the vast forest. The
story is a Brazilian legend set

the Fine Films Festival.

to somewhat labored music in a
Villa Lobos tone poem, which
was played as a sound track. The
composer would have been
proud. The wonderful, unaffect-
ed Indian characters were su-
perb, the photography and
special effects were. a_ visual
banquet of lush color and fecl-
ing.

But the high mark of the
showings was the stark and ter-
Tifying Texture of Decay, a
surrealist pastiche of night-
mare images, sharply and ener-
getically filmed, which leaves
the viewer ina tense identifica-
tion with the character who goes

through it all. This film showed
a truely sensitive and shrewd
imagination, a loving hand at
the splicing table, and a crafts-
man's skill behind the camera.
The sound track—nasty pig
grunts, metallic gratings, elec-
tric tones—was fitted with tell-
ing effect into the shifting
dreamlike episodes.

The people responsible for
bringing these films deserve a

great deal of credit, fof™they7™

are something unique in modern
art, and something well worth
seeing. This reviewer does not
recall any single evening’s ex-
perience quite like them.

Communism In Cuba
Threatens Americas

BY TONY DIAZ
; Special Staff Writer
Through the eyes of a Cuban exile we looked at
Communism last Tuesday night. Cuba was one of the
wealthiest countries in Latin America before Castro took
over. It had one of the highest standards of living, not
only in Spanish America but also in the Western world.

Cuba ha
against Communism.

The Cuban “intellectuals,”
bred at Harvard, M.LT., Univer-
sity of Miami and University of
Havana, and the Castro thugs
and other communist gangsters
trained in terrorism in Russia,
with the blessing of the. New
York Times, made the Cuban
Revolution.

Cuba needed some reforms
but certainly not the revolu-
tion that has degraded and
destroyed her. The enlighten-
ed “Liberals” pontificated
about poverty, unemployment,
tack of food, poor clothing,
etc., making of Batista’s Cuba
a rich soll for Communism.

The wealthier the country,
the better chance for a republi-
can form of government. This
absurdity is the impact.of the
Communist Manifesto on the
Western mind. Communists are
winning the world by winning
ideologically. Americans try to
combat ideas by material means.
Freedom will not triumph with
material help. Man needs a re-
ligion, a faith, an ideal to fight
for. Communism offers that.

Communists never miss a

chance to use a disparity of
conditions for propegandse

a strong middle class. The working class was

purpo.¢s around the world,
and this was the case especial-
ly in Cuba. They would broad-
cast claims that the United
States is a “parasite living on
‘the rest of the world.”

After witnessing the Cuban
tragedy Americans should make
a point of allowing their foreign
friends to see not only the side
that makes rich propaganda for
communistic lies. We know how
active the Communists are at
this moment; seeking to widen
the gap between the United
States and Latin America.

The Communist drive to
dominate Latin America is a
full-fledged offensive based in
Cubs. (t's a do-or-die cam-
paign to take over every La-
tin American country.

Should we not do as much, if
not more, than the Communists?
Let us not neglect any source of
reasonable approach, for surely
the best antidote for these
troublesome times is ways and
means fur a better understand-
ing of each other’s way of life.

This is the cement that will bind °

us closer together; not only in
South America, but also
throughout the whole world.
