Freshmen might not realize
it, but they are not the only
ones sailing on strange new
academic seas. Davidson also
sports a handful of new
professors each fall. They too
must become familiar with fa-
culty, students, and the local
area.

Professor William R. Well-
nitz received his bachelors de-
gree from Cornell, his Masters
in Molecular Biology from the
University of Colorado at Boul-
der, and a Ph.D. from Cornell.

He was teaching some lab
courses when he was informed
of an opening at Davidson
College. “‘It had just the cour-
ses I wanted to teach.” The
letter concerning the opening at
Davidson was mailed in May
and Wellnitz had not been told
of it until July 11. He ‘first
checked to see if the job still
existed and then applied. .

Coming to teach at Davidson
was a special treat for Professor
George. W. Poe. He graduated -

from Davidson in 1974 as a.

French major.

He spent his junior year in
Montpellier so he is a strong
advocate of Davidson’s foreign
exchange -program. After
spending a year studying in
Paris, he received his Masters
from Middlebury.. He is.pre-
sently working on his Ph.D. at
Duke. Returning to. Davidson is
a special pleagure: for, his wife
Sylviane because she spent a
year at Davidson as an. ex-
change student.

Poe knew basically what he
was coming back to, but he
returned-to a few changes..
“There. have been.additions: to
the physical plant. The 900
Room was a very pleasant
surprise.” He'was very anxious
to see how the:coed system was
working because it was first
instated his senior year. “I feel
that it is a definite plus. . . It
has brought in new interest and!

acne in 1968 afer

then completed the Air Defense
and the Armor Officers course
of the U.S. Army. He gradeated
from the JFK Institute for
Military Assistants. He was
taught there to become an
advisor to the Vietnamese.

He took a Command Tour in
Vietnam for 12 months. Patton ,
then served as a Tank Company
Commander in the 3rd Infantry '
Division in Germany. He served
there for 20 months. It was
from Germany that he applied
to teach at Davidson.

“T asked meres 4 to come
to Davidson, and there were

two reasons involved. One is
that I prefer a school in the
South and two because David-
son has an extremely high
reputation and I wanted to be a
part of it.”

Patton was very impressed
with the openness and courtesy
of the Davidson students.
‘‘The are really honest and
cheerful. Southern hospitality
is alive and well at Davidson
College.”

His only disappointment was
and has been that: there is no
Masters program at Davidson
because he had hoped to attain
one in Business.

Professor Russ Warren is a
member of the Art faculty and a
resident artist. Orginally from
Texas, he spent two years at the:
University of St. Thomas in
Houston and then transfered to
the University of New. Mexico

at Albequerque to receive his

BFA.
He painted for two years, a

- period he called ‘‘truly. rewar-

ding, before going to the Uni-
versity.of Texas:at San Antonio
for his MFA.

, Warren then taught courses
at. the University .and at San
Antonio College before moving
to. Florida. where: he painted in
‘Tampa Bay..::

. He.first heard of Davidson
through the Davidson Print and
Warren found Davidson: “ex-

to learn and: eager to- grasp
things they don’t understand. I
hope -to generate a lot: of
pescapemae in. the ety Depart-
ment.

The Physics Department re-
ceived a new member this year .
in Professor Lawrence S. Cain.
Cain received his undergraduate
degree at Wake Forest and did
his Masters and. Ph.D. in
Physics at the University of
Virginia.

He. spent four years as a
Research Associate and Lec-
turer at Chapel Hill. His seat
here at Davidson is his first full
time faculty position. Lecturing ;
at Chapel Hill was quite differ-:
ent than teaching at Davidson.

“The whole: faculty here’ is
only three times larger than the
Physics Department at UNC.”
He heard of the opening at
Davidson through an ad run in
Physics Today, a popular phy-
sics journal.

“All teaching jobs must be
advertized in some journal that
is well read by that field of
education.”’

Professor James Swisher,
Davidson’s new man in the
Music Department, will concen-
trate on piano studies -but he
will also teach other general
music courses and work with
the chamber music group.

Swisher started his study of
piano at age five in Germany
and continued his studies

through high school at the St.

ehigh school, Swisher received
both his undergraduate and
graduate degrees in music at
Yale University. His previous
teaching experience includes
graduate assistant work at Yale
and a year of teaching at
Wesleyan College.

Swisher will perform at least’

two major piano concerts this
year and hopes to play some
other more informal concerts.

- Michael J. Root, the newest
member of the Religion faculty
comes to Davidson from Yale
where he earned his Ph.D. in
Religion. Root completed his
undergraduate work at Dart-
mouth College.

This is Root’s first..year of
teaching. When asked why he
chose Davidson he replied that
he “wanted to teach at a small
liberal arts college that had a
good reputation, that. was lo-

cated in a small town, and that-
was close to: North Carolina.”

Davidson obviously qualified. _

A new member of the Che-
mistry faculty, but certainly no
stranger to Davidson is Profes-
sor Benjamin C. Garrett, who
graduated from Davidson in
1971. :

He received his Ph.D. in
Chemistry from Emory Univer-
sity in 1975.

He has spent the last three
years:in the army, fulfilling the
ROTC obligation he acquired
while at Davidson. He will be at
Davidson for-one year, primari-
ly teaching Chemistry 21.

Garrett sees some definite
changes in life at Davidson, the
most notable being the admis-
sion of women. He sees this as a
“pleasant change” in a social
sense stating “I was here for
three years without.a car, which
made dating very difficult.’
Another change he noted. is the
abolishment of mandatory
ROTC. ;

Professor Lani Burnett is the.
newest member of the Psycho-
logy faculty. She received her
BA in Psychology at Clemson:
and has just completed her
work for her Masters degree in
Clinical Psychology at UNC-G.

While in school, she special-
ized in the Child Development
Cognate Area of Psychology.
She was elso a teaching assis-
tant while at UNC-G.

For enjoyment, Burnett likes
ballets, drama, reading and
kids. She has not decided yet if
she will stay in the field of

‘Clinical Psychology and go for

her doctorate, or if she will go
into the area of child develop-
ment.
