‘Seventeen Colleges Defeated in
Summer Military Competition

Representatives of Davidson College
won the General Proficiency cup of the
Clemson College R. O. T. C. camp this
summer when, in competition with 17
other schools and colleges in the South,
they received the greatest number of
points in comparative ratings of units
of the R. O. T. C. Davidson scored
a total of 790.4 points in the ratings to
come out ahead of Georgia Tech, of
Atlanta, which scored 788.84 points.

The 25 students there from the Pres-»
byterian school received the full al-
lowance of 100 points in athletic par-
ticipation, scored 339.2 points in pro-
fessional knowledge and 351.2 in dis-
cipline to accumulate the winning to-
tal. Their score for
knowledge was the highest made in

that grading, and their discipline grade |

was the third highest, Wofford College, |
of Spartanburg, S. C., rating first with |
354.6 and Georgia Tech second, .38!
points ahead of Davidson. |

The Davidson unit moved into first
place during the second half period
after being second to Presbyterian Col- |

IS PLEDGE DAY

Rushing Season Is Now in Full
Swing

Formal rushing season with the
Greek letter fraternities began on the
{Davidson campus with the opening of
lcollege last Thursday, September 14
and will end with pledging services at
9 p. m. Wednesday, September 27. Ten
national social fraternities are busy
with rushing possible members to
whom they hope to send bids Tues-
!day, September 26. :

All the social organizations have
planned feeds, smokers, and other for-
mal functions to entertain members of
the Freshman ‘class. A Freshman
‘house party has been scheduled for
Saturday, September 23, and will be
the main event of Davidson’s two
weeks of greatest social activity.

The Pan-Hellenic Council has deter-
mined to make the rushing season as
inexpensive as possible this year, it was
stated by Fred L. Smyre, president of
the organizaation. To carry out this
economical plan the fraternities have
agreed to accept the “Dutch” system,
which prohibits a fraternity member
|from treating a rushee to.a movie or

|a drug store set-up.

According to custom in the past at
| Davidson, the day of silence will be-
gin at 10 o'clock p. m. next Tuesday,
and end at 7 o'clock p. m. Wednes-

D. C. SUMMER
SESSION HELD

Zoology Class Studies at the
Seashore

The Davidson College Summer
School, with an enrollment of 75 stu-

dents, enjoyed a very successful ses-

sion during the summer months.
There were cight professors who
contributed their services and aided

the boys in making up back work in
addition to teaching advanced -courses.

The main feature of the session was
the class in zoology which was capably
conducted by Professor Porter. The
class took a most interesting and in-
structive trip to the eastern part of
the state on the Coast, near Beaufort,
N. C., in pursuit of learning more about
the study of sea life.

A high light of the session was a
group of lectures given by members of
the faculty during the chapel exercises.
Dr. W. L. Lingle spoke on “College

“The New Deal;” Dr. C. M. Richards
spoke on the topic, “ Christian Citizen-
ship,” and Dr. J. M. Douglas discussed
“New Movements in Science.”

Hugh Hawkins, of Charlottesville,
Va., was elected and served as presi-

ing the summer session.

Changes

This issue of “The Davidson-
ian” is somewhat different from
those published in past years.
Several changes have occurred,
the most important of which are
a difference in the number of
columns and the addition of an
alumni page. Six columns are
now used instead of five. They
are somewhat smaller in width
than the columns of last year,
yet greater in length.

The election of an Alumni
Secretary has brought with the
position more Alumni News and
for ‘that reason one full page is
to be devoted this year to those
who have gone before us.
| The student directory has been
;| withheld from this issue because
|| during the first few days of
I hool. many ch in roqm
assignments occur, thereby mak-
| ing an early directory incorrect.
The chart will be published in
next week’s edition. A faculty
directory will be found on page 4
of this issue.

DR. W. L. LINGLE
BEGINS FIFTH

Year as Successful Leader of
Davi

Dr. Walter Lee Lingle began his
fifth year as president of Davidson Col-

_|lege as school got under way on its

ninety-eighth session. During this
time Dr. Lingle has met with great

\Siccess and has co-operated to the
“\fullest extent in supporting Davidson

College athletic teams and activities.
He ‘has upheld to the highest degree
the ideals and spirit of the school.
Dr. Lingle is a prominent and po-
tential figure in the Southern Presby-
terian Church. As is his custom each
summer, he spent several weeks at
Montreat. The first week of July h
spent there taking part in an Educa-
tional Conference. He spent another
week there the latter part of August
speaking on the general theme: “Chris-
tianity and World Problems.” The
greater part of the vacation months,
however, he was at work in his office

here at school busy answering letters
and mating plans for this year.

In comparing the outlook for this
year with that of last year, Dr. Lingle

STUDENT BODY
REGISTRATION
ABOUT NORMAL

Six Hundred Ten Students on
Registrar’s List

THREE CO-EDS

Two Hundred Sixteen New
Students

Six hundred and ten students are
registered for the fall term at David-
son College, according to the regis-
trar's office. This compares unfavor-
ably with six handred and twenty stu-
dents at the same time last year, but
the difference is made up almost en-
tirely by the decrease in the number
of girl students.

Mr. F. W. Hengeveld, the registrar,
said that only three co-eds had reg-
istered this year, as compared with
ten at the same time last year.

The number of new students’for the
presént term exceeds by fifteen the
riumber who entered last year. Two
hundred and sixteen new students are
registered. One hundred and ninety-
four are Freshmen; fourteen are
Sophomores, and eight are Juniors.

The registration according to classes
are: Seniors, 108; Juniors, 136; Sopho-
mores, 150; Freshmen, 194,

Minute statistics on registration ac-
cording to states, cities, and denom-
inations, will soon be available, Mr.
Hengeveld: said.

With the announcement that one
hundred and ninety-four Freshmen,
comprising one of the largest first-year
classes in the history of the school,
have registered, the efforts of last
year’s student body to secure a rec-
ord class seems at least partially real-
ized. ae
