DAVIDSON RADIO
PROGRAM GIVEN
NATION'S PHANG

Letters Received From Thirty
Different States By Program
Officials
LAUDED BY BANDSMEN

Congratulations Extended From
New Hampshire To
Florida

The Davidson College radio broad-
casts from Chambers, Auditoritim, which
began Friday, November 3, have excited
considerable comment from all parts.
Station WBT, Pres. Lingle, and Prof.
Pfohl have received letters of praise
from thirty states.

The following night letter was received
from Houston, Texas: “Your entire
program enjoyed immensely. Band, Dr.
Lingle’s talk, orchestra, glee club, and
organ. You have a wonderful organiza-
tion, and one that Davidson can well be
proud of. We congratulate you and will
listen in each Friday evening. Recep-
tion excellent, better than CBS from
same station.”

This letter from a Davidson alumnus
in Lenoir: “We have just been listening
to the initial broadcast from the Cham-
bers Auditorium over station WBT.
‘While we had to contend with a certain
amount of’ static, the program came
through very nicely and we enjoyed it
very much indeed. It is indeed a far
cry to the music, or what passed for mu-
sic while T was a student at Davidson,

“and Prof. Pfohl has done the college a
service which we will be discovering new
benefits from for a long time to come.

“The entire program tonight was one
in which the college and its friends may
well take pride. Hearty congratulations
on the new move to broadcast direct
from the college. I feel that it will prove
a distinct step forward.”

The following word was sent from
Indiana, Pennsylvania :

“T listened to the broadcast of your
band tonight over station WBT. My
opinion is that you have one of the finest
college bands in the country. Davidson
College should be justly proud of its
fine band. As a bandsman, T am looking
forward to future Friday night programs
featuring the Davidson College Band.”

And from Laconia, New Hampshire:
“We heard your splendid band tonight
over the radio. Please accept our con-
gratulations for having such a fine out-
fit.”

From Tallahassee, Florida: “Davidson
Glee Club Program came through fine
in Tallahassee.”

And from Charlotte: “The program of

the” Davidson Coltege Departinent of 7;

Music recently presented over station
WBT was one of the very best I have
ever heard. Davidson College and _ its
friends should be proud of the splendid
efforts which you are giving to the school
in a musical way. I feel that such a
program will put Davidson College to
the front from every standpoint.”

From Leslie; Michigan: “I have just
listened to your band program from what
I think was station WBT. If I am not
mistaken you directed the University
of Michigan band at Ann Arbor last
summer. I was one of the “poor” bari-
tone players at the time. Best of luck,
and I will be listening for you next
week.”

Audition

A tentative list of twelve men was se-

thirty students who turned out for the
first competitive trial, Wednesday, Nov.
14, to fill the announcing position for
the coming year.

The twelve students selected by Cap-
tain N. G. Pritchett, professor of physi-
cal education, who is acting as judge in
deciding the representative, were chosen
as outstanding members of the prelimin-
ary trial. These students were chosen
on quality of diction, clearness of
enunciation of the adaptability of their
voice to the amplifying system.

A second audition will be held Wed-
nesday or Thursday afternoon of this
week, during the varsity and freshman
scrimmage hour. Other requirements,
which will begin then, are: rapid fire
talk, clearness of the voice and ability to
announce play by play of the Davidson
teams in action.

Captain Pritchett will select three stu-
dents from the second audition, who are
to take quizzes on rules and regulations
of football now in vogue. English test

Two cello solos by Professor ‘Warren
Babcock opened the program proper.
These numbers were “Chante Du
Minestrel,” by Glazounow, and “Jesu,
Meine Freude,” by Bach. He was ac-
companied at the piano by Louise Nel-
son Pfohl, wife of the Davidson Director
of Music, who accompanied all the so-
loists and the quartet.

The Davidson Concert Orchestra,
which has shown real development since
last year, played “Sanctus from St. Ce-
cilia,” by Gounod. The organ, played by
Kenneth Scott, combined with the or-
chestra in this number.

Frank Tucker, Baritone, rendered two
solos, “Somewhere a Voice is Calling,”
by Tate, and Cadman’s well-known “At
Dawning”. He was followed by James
Christian Pfohl at the organ, playing
two chorales “Fierce Was the Wild Bil-
low,” and “Thy Majesty, How Vast it
is.”

The College male quartet, ‘composed of
Hubert Morris, Paul McLanahan, John
Morgan and Frank Tucker, sang the old
English air, “Drink to Me Only With
Thipe Eyes.” A saxophone solo, “Sere-
nade”, by Gabriel-Marie, was rendered
by James Chrisman. “O Davidson”
played by the orchestra, concluded the
program.

The program was broadcast from

Robert Hall Morrison Believed In
Education Of Women; Had
Six Daughters

ALL MARRIED HIGHLY

Charlotte Observer Writes Un-
usual Story Of Morrison’s
Family

,

A story of unusual interest, both to
Davidson Students, and others, appeared
several weeks ago in the Junior League
issue of the Charlotte Observer.

This story concerned the life of six
daughters of Rev. Robert Hall Morri-
son, D.D., who in 1837 founded the

training school for Presbyterian minis-
ters and named it for the Revolutionary
General William Lee Davidson, who gave
the land on which
College now stands,

our own Davidson

In those days, the emancipation of wo-
men was a thing so little thought of that
very few even perceived the possibility
of its ever existing. Dr. Morrison, how-
ever, realized the important part that in-
telligent women play in the success that
great men achieve. He often said, “Edu-
cate the women and you elevate the whole
race of mankind.” No doubt, this was a
very bold statement for those times, but
he stood up for his beliefs in the edu-
cation of his six daughters, all of whom
married outstanding men in Confedér-
ate history.

Dr. Morrison gave his daughters all
Mf the religious, cultural, and intellect-
ual advantages that he knew to be es-
sential for a life of usefulness and en-
joyment, and these daughters reflected
the influence of his christian teachings
throughout their lives, and they left to
the world many invaluable gifts in the
way of their christian character and in-
tellectual attainment.

They were often

and rightly called
“the remarkable Morrisons,” and they
certainly lived up to this title. Even
when the time came for their formal
introduction into society, two were pre-
sented at a time, always one blonde and
one brunette. All were attractive in ap-
pearance and presented a very striking
contrast of types.

In regard to learning and Christian
training, the girls were very much alike,
but early in the life of each one, her own
individual characteristics began to form.

Johnny Long Will Play
For Sophomore Dances

The next dance set on the Davidson
social calendar will be Sophomore Week-
end, held on the 14th and 15th of next
month in Charlotte.

Johnny Long and his Duke Collegians
will band together to attempt to make
the three dances of the set a credit to all
second-year men.

Following Sophomore Week-end will
be the Pan-Hellenic mid-winters, sched-
uled for either the first or second week-
end in February; at which time it is
hoped to secure some nationally-known
orchestra (not yet decided upon) as an
answer to the much-heard prayers of the
student body.

Other Pan-Hellenic functions are the
Junior Speaking Dances in March, and
the Bowery Ball in April. i

As a special feature this year, the
local chapter of Scabbard and Blade
plans a “bigger-and-better” Military Ball
which they hope to make an annual af-
fair along with other traditional “week-
ends”. As yet, the date is undecided.

Approximately thirty menchave signi-

positions on the debating team this year,
according to Bob Smith, president of the
Forensic Council, and a member of last
year’s varsity debating team.

A general subject will be given to
every man and the candidates will be at
liberty to choose either side he wishes.

The subject on which the debaters will
speak in the preliminary tryouts will be:
Resolved, that the nations agree to pre-
vent the international Shipment of arms
and munitions. ‘The time for the first
tryout has been postponed one week and
will be held on the ev Sa of November

These men will supplement the list of
varsity debaters who will return this
year. In the tryouts on’ November 27,
each speaker will be given five minutes
apiece; preliminary eliminations — will

probably then be made before the team
will be formed.
The debating trips are now being ar-

Debating has taken its proper place in

the scope of this art to the highest pos-
