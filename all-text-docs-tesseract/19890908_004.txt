Upperclassmen share their lofty ideas

*“all summer.”

By TRENT STEVENS
The loft must be free-standing
and not fastened in any way to the
walls, room furniture, or ceiling.
All of the loft’s weight must rest
on the floor.”

So reads the first of the
Davidson College Residence
Life Office’s guidelines on loft
construction. Other variables
such as materials and height
are also covered.

Despite the restrictions, the
diversity of Davidson’s lofts is
as evident as the diversity of
its’s students. Each individual
loft is a response to a unique
set of needs and limitations.

Juniors Greg Grooms and
George Snead live in Sentelle
114. Certain unnamed sources
referred to their loft as the
worst on campus. Although
Grooms disagreed, he admit-
ted, “I wouldn’t submit it to
Home and Gardens.”

“I don’t think it’s that bad. It
serves its purpose...I’d say
there’s got to bea worse lofton
campus than ours.”

Grooms named _ several '

problems, including a stolen
ladder, warped wood, a rela-
tively small room and labor
inefficiency, all of which
added up toa completion time
of three days for the project.
Nails eventually had to be

used in the place of the more
easily removable screws, anda
wedge of wood was needed to
keep the frame solidly in place
against the wall.

However, Grooms empha-
sized the loft’s strengths, such
as its “steel-reinforced” frame.

The builders had to take
special precautions in two
areas. “We tied some string
on both sides to hold in the
supporting beams on both
the lights and the vents,”
Price said, alluding to the

danger posed by movement.

and put it back together.”

construction of their loft was
hampered by the low ceiling
lights and tiles found in base-
ment Belk.

They solved the problem by
moving the lights and the air
conditioning vents to one side
of the room and by removing
the panels and their supports
from their positions above the
loft.

of the ceiling fixtures. Also,
the supports on the sides of
the rooms had to be meticu-
lously chiseled out to allow
the opening of closet doors.

Sentelle 113 is shared by
Juniors Shannon Bennett and
Andy Burroughs and _ their
split-level loft.

“We had nothing to do
with. building it,” asserted

‘hunky-dory. “We didn‘t-ac--

count for the’ height of the
room and the height of the
loft,” Bennett recalled. “We
eventually had to saw off 11
inches off of each post.”
Despite this problem, the
loft stands securely. Bennett

“We got really lucky in find-
ing this one,” added. Bur-

The actual construction of a
loft was also avoided in Belk
329, the room of sophomores
Blaine John and Benjamin
Gilmer.

“We bought it from a guy
who was in this room last year
which was just great because
all the parts fit in,” John said,
referring to the square-shaped
loft overhead. “We had to
modify it a little bit, but it fit
nicely and we didn’t have to
cut any wood.”

They spent about eight
hours on the project, in which
they stained the loft with
cherry finish and created
matching speaker shelves.

Members of the Davidson class of
1993 were well on their way to gaining
the infamous “freshman 15,” despite
the 1.7 mile course they ran during the
annual Freshman Cake Race Thurs-
day, August 24. The athletics depart-
ment reported that 130 of the newest
Davidsonians participated in the race
this year, each filled with hopes of
winning ‘One of the delicious cakes
