As usual, Davidson failed to place a man on the first
team. In fact, the only Davidson player who received any
recognition at all was sophomore end Steve Heckard, who
earned an honorable mention from the balloting. Even
Richmond, the only other team not to have a player
named to the first team, placed three men on the second

uad.

7 Why this complete ignoring of Davidson? We know
that when a team finishes low in conference standings it
does not have as many top oa as the conference
champs, but just because we didn’t have a winning team
mean we have no players of top caliber? We do not
wish to question the decision of these men, for they were
had tough decisions to make, but we do wonder if their
choice of All-Conference ends wasn’t a little in variance
with the facts.

Four conference ends polled more votes than Hec-
kard. Why? The only reason we can see for this is that
Heckard is a sophomore, which is of course not a valid
reason, and the men participating in the poll picked nine
juniors to the first team, so they weren’t giving just the
older boys votes.

A look at the statistics will show Heckard’s claim to
the first, or at least, the second team. When Davidson’s
season ended on Nov. 10, Heckard was leading the con-
ference in most areas of pass receiving. His twenty-six
catches put him on top in that category, and, in total
yardage, he was in front of any other conference end by
over yards. If this wasn’t enough, then we might add
that he also scored more points than any other end, and
most backs, in the conference.

These are the facts—how do the sportswriters ignore
them? If they say that he earned much of his record
against inferior teams, it canbe pointed out that Davidson

catches, in a game were p. ,

Why was Heckard ovetieseed? Just because David-
son had a bad year in the conference?

GOOD LUCK!

There should be a mob of Davidson fans up at Duke
tomorrow night. Athletic Director Tom Scott reports that
all of the three hundred tickets he had for sale have been
taken. The ATO’s took fifty of them and are chartering
a bus to take them to the game. That's the kind of spirit
we like to see.

Good luck tomorrow night, Wildcats. There are a
lot of people rooting for you.

Frosh Basketballers
Open With Oak Ridge

BY DENNY PHILLIPS
Sports Staff Writer

The 1962-63 version of the
Davidson College freshman bas-
ketball team makes its debut
against Oak Ridge Military In-
stitute in Johnston Gymnasium
tonight at 6:30 p.m. Last year
the frosh trounced the Oak
Ridge squad.

Coach Joe Hunt said this
year’s team has looked good
practice, but “it takes a game to
really tell how good they are.”

He praised 65” Dick Synder
and 6'3" Ronnie Stone as being
the freshman stand-outs. “Syn-
der is a real good player,’ ex
claimed Hunt, “and we're really
impressed with him. He's the
one to watch. Stone is a good
shooter and we expect things
from him also.”

Friday's starting five will
probably be composed of Syn-
der, Stone, Rufus Adair, 6'4”,
Jim Hyder, 61", and Bill Tet-
rick, 63". Completing the
eleven man rooster are Cam

—oo

Harkness, Basil Hicks, Pat Hub-
bard, ‘Tommy Reams, Alvie
Steele, and Bill Walton.

Will they be as good as last
year’s Wildkittens, who wound
up with a 15-3 record? “Well,
we have a good schedule again
this year,” stated Hunt. “We'll
be playing ‘em one at a time
and hope’ for the best. With
practice we should develop a
good basketball team, and we
hope all the boys will improve
with experience so that they can
help on next year's varsity.”

They won’t be able to.repeat
all of last year’s victories,
though. For the Universities of
North Carolina and South Caro-

Tomorrow the ‘Kittens have
their first big test, meeting the
Duke freshmen at Duke. Next
Tuesday they take on the hoop-
sters of Gardner Webb Junior

The ATO’s finished third in
