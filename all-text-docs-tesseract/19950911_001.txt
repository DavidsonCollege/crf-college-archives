Davidson College learned
Thursday that in the forthcoming
edition of U.S. News and World
Reports (USNWR) its ranking
among liberal arts colleges will
drop from eighth to twenty-first.

Since administrators only re-
ceived news of the plummet on
Thursday, most had very little to
say and only offered preliminary
reactions and evaluations.

Thief takes off

with the

goods

from Sentelle

By MatrHEw ERICH
News Editor

On Tuesday morning some-
time between midnight and 6 am,
one or several thieves stole $230
worth of cash and merchandise
from five rooms on first Sentelle.

According to Chief of Police
Rick Moore, the police have no
good suspects as of Friday after-
noon and are not ruling out
Davidson students. “Wecan’trule
out anything,” he says.

Moore says the thefts seem to
have occured while the students
were in their rooms asleep. All of
the rooms were unlocked, allow-
ing the burglar easy access.

The cash was taken mostly
from wallets left in plain view. A

CD player which was out in the
open was also taken.
Moore and Head of Campos

say the rooms were easy targets
because they were left open. Both
men concede that outsiders can get
into any dorm, but if students
locked their doors, what happened
Tuesday morning could have been
avoided.

“Tt is nearly impossible to kick
in a door,” says Moore, and he
adds, even if someone tried, many
hall members would be awakened.

Moore urges students to be
more conscious about letting non-
Davidson people in the dorms.
Moore and Thrower encourage stu-

President and Director of Institu-
tional Research John Kelton
stressed late Friday afternoon that
he had not had much time to ana-
lyze why Davidson dropped.
“We're still in the midst of analyz-
ing this,” he said.

Director of College Relations
Jerry Stockdale wrote in a memo
released to administrators on the
seventh that “a quickie analysis
reveals the following about our
drop in the ratings. We fell from
27th to 33rd on ‘Financial Re-
sources’ and — here’s the big one
— we fell from 18th to 33rd on

‘Faculty Resources.’ This latter
category is a weighted compila-
tion of several factors including
faculty compensation, student/fac-
ulty ratio, percentage of faculty
with terminal degrees, and a: few
others.”

The “few others” are 2 percent:
age of part-time faculty and class
size which is measured by the ratio
of the percentage of classes with
twenty or fewer students versus
those with 40 or more students.

Dean of Faculty Robert Will-
iams said he is “puzzled” by

Davidson’s meteoric drop. He

could only offer speculative rea-
sons for the plummet.

Williams said Davidson may
have fallen behind in a few of the
areas in “Faculty Resources” be-
cause of over-enrollment.

According to Wiliams, the last
two classes to enter Davidson have
contained thirty more students than
were expected to matriculate. This
forced the College to hire more
part-time professors, who do not
have terminal degrees, and since
these professors have less teaching

Pond project sparks debate

Racial controversy rises out of the quagmire

By JoANNA JOHNSON
Assistant News Editor

The tangle of aquatic vegeta-
tion around the Davidson Pond on
Griffith Street has woven an issue
with social, economic and biologi-
cal threads.

In its sixth year-of discussion
and planning, the restoration of the
pond and the area nearby seems to
be a distant goal for the residents
around the pond. They initially
wanted the pond repaired because
its edge, masked by the aquatic
weed, was unsafe for young chil-

dren.

Residents then asked the town
to finance a plan that included
dredging the pond and building
several new recreational amenities
around it.

Plans for improvment will
soon be presented to the Town
Board, but that has not convinced
members of the pond community
that anything will eventully hap-
pen.

Because of the area’s
demography, many complain that
this is a racial issue. Ken Torrene

. states, “[The Town of Davidson]
and Davidson college will do what
they want, when they want to doit.
[But] It ain’t gonna happen”.

Another West Davidson resi-
dent is discouraged that members
of the Town Board presented plans
to the area’s African-American
Coalition but have not acted yet.
“They got everyone’s hopes up”
she said.

Susan Britt, Davidson’s Town
and Recreation Director, contends
that something will be done. “Yes,
there is a commitment to complet-

explains that the town never prom-
ised immediate completion.
“Somehow that community orga-
nization forgot that they recom-
mended it be done in phases.”
Phase one, to be presented to
the board on September 12, details
a plan to drain the lake in order to
remove much of the silt that has
entered the pond through two
streams and a pipe. This build- up
of material has invited the growth

pond, as it can only grow in shal-

A year ago, English Professor
Randy Nelson packed up his Cham-
bers office and moved to #7 Jack-
son Court. There, as the director of
Davidson College’s Self-Study he
began atwo-year process of exam-
ining the details of Davidson’s
operations.

Now marks the beginning of
the second year of the study, as
wellas the finalization of one of its
two major parts: the Compliance
Audit.

The audit is based on informa-
tion requested by the Southern
Association of Colleges and
Schools (SACS). Regional agen-
cies such as SACS operate on be-
half of the federal government spe-
cifically to outline the conditions
for re-accreditation.

The requirements are pre-
sented in the form of “must state-
ments” in the 1995 Criteria for
Accreditation. Nelson and his
Compliance Committee have spent
a year gathering data to find out if
Davidson meets the requirements
it “must” for re-accreditation.

Re-accreditation is essential
for each school every ten years.
