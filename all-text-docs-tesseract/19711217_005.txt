LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Foreign Students Criticize Davidson

To The Editor:

The first thing that struck me
on seeing Davidson College was
the classical-revivalist style of
architecture; a uniformity of
design that with regard to a
few buildings is harmonious, but
in others it becomes painfully
contrived.

However, the drawbacks of
the architecture, which of
course is only a matter of taste,
can easliy be tolerated unless
one considers what these may
symbolize about the life of the
College within those buildings.

As I became more acquaint-
ed with the life at Davidson I
found that the traditionalism
and conformity were not mere-
ly characteristics of the facade.

I found that a large propor-
tion of students here are sons
of Davidson alumni and also a
significant section of the faculty
are former Davidson students.

This of course maintains a
sense of continuity and links
with the past but also creates
an amount of in-breeding which
may not be healthy for the Col-
lege.

Many of the students are from
similar backgrounds, mostly
middle- and upper middle-class,
which gives the College its eli-
tist flavour. It was also notice-
able that there were only a
very few black students attend-
ing the College.

I found also that the atmos-
phere at Davidson was almost
Spartan. One soon realizes that
the paucity of social life is not
only due to the lack of women,
but that there are no facilities
provided in the town of David-
son and virtually none on the
campus.

By this time such pleasant as-
pects of being in a sleepy little
town as the unhurried and re-
laxing atmosphere, people al-
ways having time to say a few
words, the advantage of being

far removed from the dirt and
bustle of a big city, soon turn
sour as the unrelieved duliness
of College life makes itself felt.

The only facilities that are
offered are the fraternities,
which themselves are experienc-
ing a period of transition. It
seems a pity that these small
places, which are perforce re-
stricted in what they can pro-
vide, are not supplemented by
a more active program given
by the student’s Union.

The academic life also seems
to be lacking in stimulation
and vitality. It appears much
emphasis is placed upon lec-
tures that give little opportunity
for constructive feedback from
the students. When discussion
groups are used it appears that
both students and faculty are
unfamiliar with the technique
to derive sufficient benefit from
them.

In addition, the courses on
the whole are rigidly structured
owing to the importance given
to periodic tests and final ex-
amniations. This does not allow
for much digression and gives
students little opportunity to
pursue in depth particular areas
which interest them because it
is necessary to cover all the
required course work (unless
you are one of the fortunate
few in the Honors College).

It also leads in some degree
to a mirroring of attitudes of
the teacher because students
have to regurgitate in the ex-
aminations what has been
spoon-fed to them by the pro-
fessors, and there is little time
to cover controversial areas in
the subject or the incentive to
express unorthodox opinions.

Something else which I dis-
covered at Davidson was the
almost moribund state of stu-
dent politics. I found that stu-
dent representation on import-
ant policy-making committees
was small or non-existent, and

in many cases the students only
had observer status.

There are no meetings of the
student body to provide a forum
for debate about issues concern-
ing the College, nor an effectual
means of communicating to the
students what happens in the
SGA and in the College ad-
ministration.

THE DAVIDSONIAN appears
more like a church magazine
rather than a student publica-
tion. I was told how many of
the decisions affecting student
life were influenced by the opin-
ions and wishes of the alumni,
another means whereby tradi-
tionalism is able to become en-
trenched.

| am not trying to denegrate
tradition per se but when it
subordinates the needs of the
students then | feel it has a
deleterious influence upon the
College.

After a few weeks at David-
son I was introduced to the
cattle-market that goes under
the name of dating. I carefully
avoided the more blatant illus-
trations-of this which were the
“‘mixers” at the beginning of
the autumn term, where the
girls are loaded off the wagons
and paired off with the heavy-
breathing freshmen.

This artificial means of meet-
ing girls can prove to be un-
satisfactory if, for example, one
is thrown together with a girl
for a whole weekend with whom
one has absolutely nothing in
common. This is just sheer
agony for both parties.

For myself, I have been quite
fortunate, but this unnatural
state of affairs wil continue
until reason prevails and co-
education is introduced. How-
ever, what is more obnoxious
about the system is the attitudes
which it seems to generate. The
girls are hardly considered as
people but as sex-objects by the
frustrated monks of Davidson.

I should like now to say some-
thing concerning the interna-
tional students generally. While
eating in the Union one day all
of us were admonished for not
making an effort to mingle with
the American students instead
of remaining in a group.

This, however, is only symp-
tomatic of what has been hap-
pening overall, that many of
us have found it difficult to in-
tegrate with the rest of the
student body and thus have
formed our own clique.

The difficulty does not only
lay on our side but also with
the Davidson students them-
selves.

Maybe the Davidson students
have enough difficulty relating
to each other let alone with peo-
ple from different cultures? |
do think, though, that the prob-
lem is already being amelior-
ated, and it only takes time.

I would suggest, nevertheless,
that to improve the situation
further the Office of Interna-
tional Education should allow
each foreign student to become
a member of a fraternity, this
way he will meet more people
in more relaxing circumstances
and also relieve the common
complaint of there being little
social life.

To The Editor:

As all the International Stu-
dents were eating supper in
the marvelous school cafeteria
one day, a member of the staff
came up to us and told us that
he was going ‘to penalize’ us
for eating together and not
mingling with the rest of the
American students, and that we
‘should try’ to do it and not
just ‘stick together.’

There were quite a few reac-
tions among us such as—‘‘What
else is there to do when we

hardly know any of the stu-
dents that eat here”; ‘‘Do you
expect us to go sit at a table
and say Hi!, I'm from Mexico,
and I’m an International Stu-
dent,” (Big Deal), when there is
no hospitality, or when we get
a reaction such as ‘What is it
to me?”

The main problem is that we
all feel left out of the commu-
nity and with the only alterna-
tive of ‘‘sticking together’’ and
learning about the different
countries that we represent; not
that this is bad, but that makes
us realize that we simply have
to say ‘‘so much for the Amer-
ican cultural experience that I
was supposed to get here.”

It is hard on exchange stu-
dents to compare U. S. hospital-
ity to that of our own countries.
Phil Fleming and | went to a
party that was supposed to be
opened to anybody.

We got there and had to find
our way around as we were be-
ing looked down upon, and even
though 99 per cent of the peo-
ple there had seen us around,
or at least knew that we were
exchange students, nobody was
hospitable enough to give us
a remark of friendship.

Some of you might wonder:
“Why is he complaining since
all of them have a nice schol-
arship?”’.

This is my answer: | believe
that this is part of the ‘‘interna-
tional experience’ that | came
to get here, so | am going to
have to put up with it whether
| like it or not; therefore, 1
am _ not complaining, but | am
only trying to create some
awareness of what an Interna-
tional Student has to go through.

The solution? I do not know
one, but you as hosts, may think
of one (but please do not come
up with the archaic answer —

“vou don’t like it, leave!”).

Huller Deplores Damage
Inflicted By Snowballs

To The Editor:

During last year’s rioting on
the college campuses, not many
students seemed to care about
the property damage they were
doing; that is, until an inno-
cent student was killed in a
bomb explosion.

Here at Davidson, as evid-
enced last weekend, not many
students seemed to care about
the glass windows they were
breaking; luckily, no student (to
my knowledge) was_ seriously
injured. ;

Dormitories are not the places
to have snowball battles near.
Any person with common sense
(aparently lacking in quite a
few Davidson students) would
realize the potential dangers.
Under the right conditions, a

snowball could be as lethal (or |

as damaging) as flying glass.

Those who used the doors
and windows for protection to
throw snowballs from were just
as guilty as those throwing at
these students.

While freshmen may be “‘re-
strained” by their hall coun-

selors, the upperclassmen are
subject to no such “restraint.”

It hardly helps our image
when the town children see (and
participate in) this wanton and
potentially dangerous destruc-
tion of property by supposedly
‘top-notch students.”

Notwithstanding the fact that
tuition may increase ‘next year
to pay for this damage (though,
not solely for this reason), many
students were oblivious: to the
ramifications of their snowball
fights near the dorms.

One student was almost hit
by flying glass in his room.
There was a snowball fight out-
side, and one was thrown too
high.

Despite the fact that the snow-
ball was thrown some fifty feet
away, it sent glass flying ten
feet into the student’s room.
The glass missed the student
this time. But, next time?

Such crass conduct is disgust-
ing.
