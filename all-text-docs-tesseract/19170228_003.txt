A PREREQUISITE.

The editor of THE Davinsonian, in| 413 Realty Building

an editorial in the last issue, hits the nail
squarely on the head when he says that
the majority of college students lack
conviction on the questions of the day,
especially on those which confront them
in college life. But there is something
else lacking, something which must nec-
essarily precede conviction, and that is
thought. After a period of four years
in college a boy's head is full to over-
flowing with the thoughts of others.
The question is: Does he use these
thoughts in arriving at a conviction on
the great questions of the day or does
he follow the easier alternative of hold-
ing thoughts and facts until examination
time and then allow them to sink into
oblivion? To follow the first course is
.to train the memory; to follow the sec-
ond is to make the man which the Twen-
tieth Century demands—a thinking man.

After all jthe very purpose of college
is to train men to think. It is well to
know all the thoughts of all the great
thinkers; but there is something better
than all that—‘“to think vourself.” Tf
the man, with a college education, goes
out into the world and fails—and there
are many who do—it is_nat because he
does not know, but because has has not
been trained to think.

After the regular debate in the Liter-
ary Society an opportunity should be
given to any member to express his opin-
ion or conviction on the question which
has just been debated. After college
davs shall have ended we will debate
questions, not for the training which we
will acquire. but from a sense of con
viction. Hence, right here at Davidson,
after we have debated a question for the
practice which there is in it, for us, we
should debate it according as our convic-
tion may dictate.

So much for convictions orally ex-
pressed. But a college man, if he would
be symmetrically trained, must be able
to express his thoughts in writing as weil
as by word of mouth. The Freshmen
English course, as at present constituted,
is a good medium for constructive think
ing to the first-vear men. Much free
dom is allowed in the treatment of vital
auestions. It seems to me that there
should be one or two courses in. each of
the other vears which allows the same
freedom of treatment.

POLITY CLUB MEFTS.

At the meeting of the Polity Club,
last night, the book, “Japanese Expan-
sion, and the American Policy,” — was
discussed by W. C. Cumming.
ming made an interesting and com-
prehensive talk, his main topic heing the
probability of a war between the United
States and Japan. The author of the
book, Dr. Abbott, who was for several
years a professor in the Imperial Uni-
versitv at Tokio, thinks that such a war
is highly improbable. He advances sev-
tral strong arguments against such a
war, but declares that the most potent
influence for the war is the war talk in
our country.
