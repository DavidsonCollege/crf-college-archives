Intramurals .. .

For those who are incapable of making
varsity teams here at Davidson a program
of Intramurals exists. To those.of us who
participate in these contests between dorms,
fraternities, etc., it is an invaluable—pas-
time. To those who direct the program,
congratulations and thanks are in. order.

This year the program has been elaborat-
ed to a greater extent.and more boys can be
active along these lines. Not only does it
afford students a chance to improve their
physical capacities butt also creates friend-

ship, keen rivalry, and interest around the
campus.

For this new program to be_a_ success
more men must enter and take an interest
in it. Frankly if a person ever enters one
of the many contests (there are games that
every one can play or do) he will continue.
Again the proverbial orchids are due to our

much ashamed of hynself, if that exhibit
was placed on the stage in Chambers: andi-

and books before they have been used by
other students rightfully ought to b&asham-

free access to any reading matter in the

free access. Maybe somebody ought to put

There is a general feeling among colleg-

some two or three years ago seem to be
cropping up anew. Listen to the University

says we can’t stay out of war, say: ‘We

the Hall-Johnson choir.

It’s Bobby Breen again in this
film with better interest than most
of his preceding pictures. The ex-
tremely colorful atmosphere of New
Orleans just prior to.the Civil War
is reproduced, and this affords the
Hall-Johnson negro choir a chance
to render some beautiful spirituals
in true negro style. The setting is
in Louisiana Where Bobby’s father,
Ralph Morgan, is killed, and an un-

scrupulous lawyer, Alan Mowbray,

tries to wrest the great fortune
from Bobby. Of course Bobby's
singing is one of the highlights of
the show. ‘
