Observations From
Debate On Labor

* The following are observa-
tions made by Brooks, Guthrie,
and Haigler on the McClellan
Committee in their debate this
past Tuesday.

Haigler: There are barons in
unions just. aS there are in
business and. politics. There is
no excuse for them anywhere.
! There is no place in the trade
-union movement for Dave
Becks. .

Probably because of this com-
mittee’s activities (which are
admittedly biased) legislation
will be introduced into Congress
compelling: Union trust super-
vision, opening of their books.
jand the elimination of such
things as. paper locals.

These unions are moving. to

no need for federal interven-
tion.

Brooks: The MéClellan probe
has shown that labor is infil-
trated by elements of crime;
that it is capable of abusing its
power: that. it wields great
power over people: and that
tremendous money is involved

Legislation is necessary. I
“would expect a) minimum in|
cluding regutation of pension
funds and the establishment of |
safeguards in union clectians..

Guthrie:, Very likely. there
will be stréng agitation before:
the coming session of Congress;
for a federal right-to-work law

theme. Three performances

When the demand grew, the

Y.M.C.A, took over the service
as a part of its work. Since
its conception, the preacher-
supply service has grown until
more than a dozen churches are
served on Sundays by Davidson
College students.

At present, according to Dr.
Staples, there are about twelve
Davidson students who serve
regular charges, plus a group

longplaying discs and the stock
is growing all the time. This
collection contains a very large
number of contemporary works.

Work as a “part-time preach-
er” may carry a Davidson stu-
dent. as much as forty miles
one-way to reach a church.
Many of the churches are lo-
cated on far-removed dirt roads
in rural areas, while others are
small churches in. urban areas.

One student, Harry Pasohall,
regularly serves a church or-
ganized near a dude ranch. It's
an inter-denominational charge
known as “Love Valley
Church”.

Another rural church— one
with a congregation of eighteen
members—never knows who its
preacher will be until he stands
to hegin the service: students
alternate in serving this one.
