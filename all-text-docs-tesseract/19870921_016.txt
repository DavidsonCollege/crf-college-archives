ROTTEN, continued from page 15
single-sex houses.

I’m not trying to condemn this change. The Court of-
fers many opportunities for personal growth and
friendships. But I do feel that the emphasis on the houses
isolates individuals, the sexes, students’ energies, and gen-
erally de-emphasizes the college community as a whole.
But the Court is the most vibrant place on campus. Most
student organizations are hardly lively; indeed they must
struggle to exist. Ido not welcome or condemn the change; I

‘accept it as the will of the student body . I do feel that David-
son is much more boring than it was ten years ago. Think of
your own situation. Unless your are a heroic part of some
student organization, what can you specifically tell others
about you and Davidson? Other than our course work, most
of our thoughts regard specific social situations, not partici-
pation in an orginization.

The death of “Flipsides” points to the void in student
culture at Davidson. I ask you to pick up an annual or news-
paper of eight or ten years ago and try to imagine what the

school was like. Compare it with the current newspaper or
annual. The difference is dramatic. I wonder what students
who look at us in ten years will think about us after seeing
these publications. Finally; ask yourself what have, you
done at Davidson (other than course work) that you can re-
ally be proud of ten years from now. Unless we make an ef-
fort to improve the quality of our college community and to
enrich our lives, we can expect our memories of Davidson
to be a bland collage of half-read books and unconnected
social incidents involving people we might have known.
