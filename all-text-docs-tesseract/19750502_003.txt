Changing food service hopes |

‘optimistic return’ develops

Changes in the food service
next year include an increase in
the board rate , the closing of
Rusk House and no meal ticket
purchases past 7P.M. in the new
Union.

“It’s a very good possibility
that freshmen can buy a
reduced meal ticket plan,’’ said
ARA slater food director Ron
Scott. He added that there was
no chance of a money return

system.
Problems with the food
service include the lack of

centralization, inadequate
equipment and space and an
inability to show a fair profit.

“With a centralized food
service I can lower board rates.
offer better services and more
quality service,’ stressed Scott.
‘The board rate this year’ was
$710; another college of the
same size does it for $480 with a
“centralized food service.” .

Bo’ Baskin, who has been
investigating the problem for
the SGA Senate recognizes the
primary problem as being the
lack of a centralized food ser-
vice.

‘What we need now is to think
in terms of a long range
solution. The eating houses will
not be large enough if the
college continues with its
planned ecpansion.’’ said
Baskin before the Senate...

Scott added that if the college
goes to an enrollment of ‘1,500
there will have to be a cen-
tralized service.”

Scott added that if the college
goes to an enrollment of 1,500,
there will have to be a cen-
tralized service. ‘‘The luxury of
three seperate houses plus the
eating clubs will become
financially impossible.”

Scott also pointed out that this
year the Davidson branch of
ARA realized less than a one
percent profit. ‘“‘We are not
realizing the fair return that we
thought that we might get.” .

“Our board plan next year
reflects a more optimistic
return,’ added Scott. ‘This
year we did not even make
enough to meet our ad-
ministrative expenses.”

Scott added, ‘‘We feel that we
can operate at less than the
college can afford to and still
return a profit.”

‘In response to a question on
the feasibility of a nonman-
datory freshman _ dining
program, Scott said it was not

possible for two reasons, the
necessity of a mandatory
system for financial reasons
and the parents point of view.

Another major difficulty is
the lack of space for storage,
particularly refrigeration. The
equipment is also in poor
condition.

Scott feels that both of these
problems could be lessened by a
centralized eating service.

In a recent survey of 130 men
and 72 women Bo Baskin
discovered that if the average
amount lost by the resell or non
use of tickets is extended over
the entire freshmen class, over
$17,000 has been lost.

One possible solution would
be to extend two possible meal
ticket plans to freshmen next
year. This summer all of next
year’s freshman class would be
mailed a letter informing them
of their options.

They then would select one of
the two meal plans for the fall

term. After the fall term they
would be allowed to choose
between the two plans again.

Scott said that other problems
include the failure of the college
to warn him when people are

coming on campus. He stated, .

“This increases wastage in that
we have’ to cook extra food in
case there are unexpected
feople on campus.”

Scott also added, ‘‘We have a
problem with students stealing
food; of course it effects us. As
long as you have self-service
you will have this problem.”’

As a control of this problem
there will be no self service in
the Union next year. The new
Union will include a snack bar,
eggs, pizza and deli-type sand-
wiches. The operation of the
beer will be decided by the
Union.

Richards and Bailey will both
go to Cafeteria style operations.
One of them will feature an
enlarged salad bar.

. Fire excape routes remain out of sight

Printed maps for a safe
evacuation from the dor-
mitories in case of fire are
currently not available to
students.

Plans for organized escape
from the dorms in case of fire
are drawn up and sitting in the
office of Director of the
Physical Plant Grover C.
Meetze.

These plans were printed and
placed in the dorms five years
ago, according to Director of
Housing Scotty Nicolls.

“We have a fire plan that
somebody in the Physical Plant
office worked out. It was made
before the fire alarms were in-
stalled. A couple of students
have pointed out to me in recent
years that these plans are no
longer up.”’ said ‘Nicolls

Since the printing and posting
of the first fire escape plans,
“about five years ago’’ ac-
cording to Nicolls. the Physical
Plant is supposed to have a fire
plan on every bulletin board’in
every room. I used to remind
them every summer that this
needed to be done. But I don’t
believe it has,”’ said Nicolls .

Meetze believes that his office

has not been notified that the
plans were ever down from the

Blood goals realized

The Red Cross Blood Drive on
April 24 collected 240 pints of
blood. ‘‘The drive was a
resounding successs,’’ said
sponsor Captain William L.
DeVaughan.

“This result guarantees blood

insurance for all Davidson:

faculty,staff, students and their
families, even those who did not
give blood.”’

The results of the April 24th
donations brought | the year’s
total to 490 pints, well above the
Davidson College quota of 430.
241 donars participated in the
September drive, while nine
gave at the: Blood Center in
Charlotte during the year.

posted these in every dorm.
Mrs. Nicolls hasn’t spoken to
me lately. I guess if students
have torn them off the walls the
plans are down now,” said
Meetze.
Meetze expressed concern
that the escape plans were down
and plans to re-distribute them
as soon as copies can be made.
A primary cause of fire in the
dorms, and perhaps the easiest
cause to control is the misuse
of electric appliances. Some
appliances can burst into
flames if left on. These ap-
pliances, notably open-coil hot
plates: are forbidden in the

An over use of electricity can
cause an overload of the circuit
in a room. An overloaded cir-
cuit can cause an electrical fire.

iNicolls. has asked the
Physical plant to make in-
formation on the exact wattage
in each room available to the
inhabitants of that room. It was
thought that this information
might keep the student from
overloading the circuit in his
room accidentally.

“Each room is supposed to
have posted in it the amount of
wattage available to that room
so that students can tell when
they are reaching the limit. Mr.

Meetze decided to put the in-
formation in each room. I don’t
think it is anywhere at all,”’ said
Nicolls .

Meetze explains that Nicolls
wrote a memo to all students
telling the wattage available in
each of the dorms and including
a list of wattages for some of the
most widely used electrical
appliances in 1969. These
memos were never distributed,
but they can be duplicated now
and distributed, according to
Meetize.

“I think the wattage _ in-
formation was in the handbook
a few years ago, Mrs.
Nicolls; has a February 14,
1969 memo to all students on it. I
don’t know why it was never
distributed. I didn’t know we
were supposed to distribute
them,” he said.

“The list of wattages is with
Mrs. Nichols, she has them. She
could run some copies herself
and distribute them,’’ continued
Meetze.

“Simply, Watts, Cannon, and
Sentelle have 250 watts
available to each room. Duke
has 700. Belk, Richardson and
Little have 800 watts. I guess
these should be posted for the
inspection situation,’’ he con-
cluded.

‘Nicolls; expressed some
concern that Duke _ Dor-
mitory,because it only has one
exit is in violation of
regualtions.

“There are supposed to be
two ways out of a building. The
only building in violation is
Duke. It is our biggest fire
hazard.’’ she asserted.

Duke isn’t very tall, maybe
students could jump if there
was a fire,’’ she added.

According to Meetze, federal
officials have checked Duke

. and have never said anything.

He suggested that building
codes change and that Duke is
in compliance with the code
under which it was built.

‘‘When the building was
designed, it was designed so
that in case of fire, you could go
up to the third level, go.across
and then down. This gives it two
exits. As long as you have two
exits, that is all the state asks
for.’’
