(Letters to “he editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

T. S. Eliot

T. S. Eliot left this week the en-
virons which he pictured as bleak and
sterile in his classic The Waste Land.
Before us now lies a gaping hiatus in
the ranks of social critics and literary
figures.

While in theory a traditionalist and
classicist, Eliot attained literary fame
with the iconoclastic technique he em-
ployed in his pessimistic examina-
tions of the void and sterility of mod-
ern society.

_ Self-styled as “an Anglo-Catholic
in religion, a classicist in literature.
and a royalist in politics,” the Ameri
can emigrant warned dismally that we
are “destroying our ancient edifices to

make ready the ground upon which
the barbarian nomads of the future
will encamp in their mechanized cara-
vans.”

T. S. Eliot has taken leave of our
ever-changing society. But he has left
with us observations worth noting and
admonitions worth heeding: “The ten-
dency of unlimited industrialism is to
create bodies of men and women—of
all classes—detached from. tradition,
alienated from religion, and suscept-
ible to mass suggestion: in other
words, a mob. And a mob will be no
less a mob if it is well fed, well
clothed, well housed, and well discip-
ined.”

Addressing The Public

“A caravan will leave at 10 o’clock
...” blared the loud-speaker atop
Chambers during second period this
morning. The professor halted, then
continued his lecture. A few minutes
passed. Then again the loud speaker
vomited: ‘A caravan will leave at ten
o’clock . . .”” The professor halted his
lecture again, made a wry but bitter
comment, then continued.

Several more minutes, then the
sweet voice boomed across the cam-
pus: “Lawrence, Lawrence. Please
come to the Union desk. Lawrence.
Lawrence. Please come to the Union
desk.” Again the professor halted. His
comment was more wry and more bit-
ter. The lecture began again only to
be quickly interrupted by “A caravan .
will leave at ten o’clock . . .” An angry
professor quietiy retorted, “Class dis-
missed.”

A motorcade to meet the vic-
torious Wildcats merits applause. But
such planning—twenty minute notice
—is poor. Are we such fair-weather

Aid?

President Johnson in his State of
the Union message Monday night
promised a push for increased federal
aid to education:

“In addition to our existing pro-
grams, I will recommend a new pro-
gram for schools and students with a
first-year authorization of 1 billion
500 million dollars...

“For the preschool years we will
help needy children become aware
of the excitement of learning.

“For the primary and secondary
school years we will aid public schools
serving low income families and as-
sist students in both public and pri-
vate schools.

“For the college years we will
provide scholarships to high school
students of the greatest promise and
the greatest need and we will guar-
antee low interest loans to students
continuing their college studies.”

The prospect—indeed, the inevi-
tability—of additional federal funds
pouring into the nation’s educational
systems arouses mixed emotions. The
prospect of improving all-important

Action

Student Council tabled Tuesday
night a proposed study of the Faculty
Vow and the problems surrounding it.
Council acted on the recommendation
of President Will Jackson who—after
consulting with faculty members—
felt that any action on the part of
Council would hinder proponents of
changing the vow.

Apparently Council shares a mu-
tual goal with us, namely, that the

fans that a final score is necessary
before arrangements for a hearty re-
ception can be made?

But equally poor is the blatant
abuse of the community via the Cham-
bers loudspeaker. That the public ad-
dress system was useful in reaching
the student body is obvious. But equal-
ly obvious is the testimony to poor
planning given by the blaring speak-
er.

This morning's interruption re-
minds us of another that occurred re-
cently. While more than fifty people
were struggling with the strictly tim-
ed Law School Admission Test—the
law boards—on November 14, un-
bridled “school spirit” prompted an-
other Wildcat booster to play the Da-
vidson fight song for somewhat more
than seven minutes from the much
abused loudspeaker.

A bit of foresight in the future
use of the damn thing would be ap-
preciated.

education is heartening. But accom-
panying the perennial question of fed-
eral aid to education is the perennial
fear of federal control.

The administration made quite
clear the “power of the purse” only
Shortly before the President’s ad-
dress: public schools and colleges now
receiving federal aid were notified
that steps must be taken immediately
toward an eventual ending of racial
discrimination if and where it exists.

; This notification is in accordance
with the terms of Title VI of the 1964
Civil Rights Act.

Non-compliance would result in
the cut-off of federal funds.

Whether or not the cut-off of
funds is justifiable is nat our concern
here: the significance is that the fed-
eral government can and will exer-
cise financial pressures to accomplish
its ends.

We await further details of the
President’s program of aid to educa-
tion, a program which deserves care-
ful examination. We wish to see what
elements of control accompany the
proposal of the President.

vow should be changed. But our dis-
cussions with concerned faculty mem-
bers have not led to the conclusion
presented to Council.

Students — as individuals and
through Council — should express
their feelings on this matter, an ex-
pression which would hopefully be a
boon—not a hinderance—to working
out an acceptable solution.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Plea For More Toleration
Marks Latest Greek Letter

Dear Editor:

The fraternity question has
taken much space in this paper
the last several issues, and there
have been proposals and count-
erproposals made by the cor-
responding sides. As in any dis-
cussion of this type, some com-
ments have been well taken
while others have not been.
What we must realize is that
constructive changes should be
made in the present system of
fraternities; however. debating
the abolition of this fraternity
system is not the path towards
a constructive solution.

To use a popular. although
somewhat trite. expression, we
must all reason together in
searching for a solution which
will benefit the whole student
body, fraternity men, indepen-
dents, and faculty.

The’ proposal of one hundred
per cent bidding does not seem
to be an acceptable solution;
however, many evils of the pre-
sent system can be eliminated
by delaying rush until second
semester. Included in the rush
regulations must be limitations
on the amount of time a rushee
can spend at the fraternity
house during the first semester
should a delayed rush be adopt-
ed.

The main thing which the fra-
ternities can do to improve
their own position is to strength-
en the IFC. As stated in a re-
cent DAVIDSONIAN editorial.
the IFC must be more than
a “glorified booking agency.”
Such fraternity programs as
pledge training can be regulat-
ed by the fraternities themselves
through this strengthened and
broadened IFC.

There must .be developed a
definite alternative to the frat-
ernity. This could be done per-
haps through some form ‘of eat-
ing clubs or local fraternities.
There is a definite need for
help from the college itself, not
just within the student body.

Dear Editor:

The subject of fraternities has
again become the focus of a
great deal of discussion. Pros
and cons have been hurled back
and forth across the campus,

until one wishes the subject had
never been brought up. It seems
that all arguments have been
summed up for both sides and
that it is up to the individual
to choose. And there are cer-
tainly a number of sincere and
concernéd students on both sides
of the controversy.

But I would like to put forth
another thesis: that it is im-
possible for Davidson to retain
both her fraternity system and
her claim to Christian committ-
ment, that the ‘fraternal’ sys-
tem is so basically immoral as
to make any reconciliation be-
tween it and Christian morality
impossible.

Instead of proceeding from
unassailable basic propositions,
such as “love thy neighbor” and
the Christian insistence tbat
every man is his brother's
keeper. and disregarding such
obvious fallacies as “each man
has the right to choose his
brothers’ (as one of the na-
tional fraternity magazines pro-
claimed some years ago!), I
would like to relate an exper-
jence of my freshman year.

When I was a freshman the
bids were sent by mail Satur-
day morning. That morning,
after breakfast, there was a mad
rush to the post office to see
if “the” fraternity had come
through. if one would have fo
join “that” one, or -if. heart-
breakingly. one would have to
pledge Gamma Delta Iota.
Though by no means a highly
sought after freshman, I had
received a gratifying amount
of attention during rush and
joined this hopeful fearful
throng.

On the way across campus I
noticed a boy. another freshman,
standing beside Chambers
Building. looking at the seating
charts. I didn’t pay much at-
tention, but happened to see him
still standing there and looking
at the charts fifteen minutes
later. He wasn't a particularly
attractive boy. not well-dressed.
or personable. In fact he might
be termed a ‘‘clod.” I was too
excited at the moment, in the
rush of pledging and later in
the flurry of pledge activities.
to think much about him. Yet
later the image of that boy be-
gan to haunt me. And still does.
For he was one of the despised
class, that was not pledged or
perhaps even redated.

£0 IT WONT Go Our
BEFORE | GET THERE.

Whether the fraternities cor-
rectly applied their standards
to him or not is irrelevant. For
the simple fact of standards
based upon coolness, money, or
even brains, leadership, or per-
sonality is in itself immoral!
Regardless of what standards
are ‘instituted, these standards
insist upon the acceptance or
rejection of persons. And make
no mistake; it is rejection! Des-
pite, everything else which may
be said, the independent, parti-
cularly the underclassman, is
isolated, cut off from social. life,
from cars and from girls.

And the most significant factor
of all is the feeling of “unworth-
iness” which so often attends
the independent’s rejection. He
has been found unfit to belong
to a fraternity. This rejection
of persons is diametrically op-
posed to the absolute, radical,
and unconditional demand for
acceptance which Christianity

makes. Not only do the frater- |

nities isolate the independent in
a physical and social sense. but
they say quite clearly and dis-
tinctly: ‘‘You do not- meet our
conditions of acceptability.”
And this is immoral!

Nor let us hear more of 100
per cent rush nor of sophomore
tush. For while with the first,
all would be officially in a fra-
ternity, what is the advantage
of being in a “fraternity” where
one’s presence is resented? And
while sophomore rush would
assure that the “right” boys
got into the “right” fraternities,
what is the advantage for the
boys who are “wrong” for all
the fraternities?

And to speak of the ‘“‘inevi-
tability of social cliques” is bla-
tant nonsense! For, although
there will certainly always be
cliques, what reason is this for
formalizing and ‘putting the of-
ficial stamp of approval,” so to
speak, on these cliques and by
inference, on their rejection of
certain persons. These persons
are outside the pale; they do
not belong to a fraternity.

And finally, I assume that no
one will bring up the weary old
argument of ‘‘the greatest good
for the greatest number,” which
could be used just as effectively
by Hitler, from his point of view,
as by the IFC, from its point
of view.

The issue is clear-cut and well-
defined. The exclusive principle.
upon which the fraternity sys-
tem is based. is in basic con-
flict with the Christian impera-
tive to love. There can be no
compromise; the system must
be abolished, or so radically
altered that it is no longer, in
any way. exclusive!

With Feeling

By TIM KIMREY
Davidsonian Associate Editor

It is impossible to be profound, much less poetic,
about the coming of a New Year. The passage from
1964 into 1965 consumes only a fraction of a mo-
ment, and, despite all the thousands who await that
instant in Times Square each December 31, despite
the popping of champagne corks all over the world
at the arrival of the Mystic Minute, the sun will still
shine the same way this year that it did in 1964, the
twelve months will pass again in the same ordered

ion.

sneeand yet, despite the obviously unspectacular
nature of the coming of a new year, it is a most con-
venient time too for us to pause briefly for a glance
backward at the days since the last new year and to
stupidly wonder about the 365 unexperienced tomor-
rows that will pass before the next. It is a time for
ordering, for cataloguing, the joys and horrors of the
past year; it is a time for arranging, In some nebu-
lous fashion, one’s hopes and expectations and doubts
about the coming year. oo,

It is the moment of grieving and rejoicing in
what man has done within the constancy and har-
mony of God’s world. ;

Tt cannot be said that 1964 was either a good or
bad year—for this nation or for the world at large.
In some respects it was a most uneventful period
for the United States. A very dry, ridiculously shal-
low national election held the spotlight, and after it
was all over no one could say that he was looking
forward with great enthusiasm to four years under
Lyndon Johnson. Somehow LBJ and his Texan co-
horts just don’t seem to be the kind to lead a “Great
Society” that I want any part of.

And Barry Goldwater will probably spend all
‘of 1965 doing research on why he lost the election.

Ha.

On the world scene, old cuddly, toothy Khrushchev
got the boot, and Red China got her hands on an A-
bomb. Fine. Indonesia celebrated New Year’s with
the announcement that she would withdraw from the
U.N. And the old world seemed as shaky as ever
when the bells heralded the new year. But at least
we survived the year. No bombs fell. No grand-scale
racial war erupted. 7

And Mississippi emerged as the most pitiful ex-
cuse for civilization on this side of the Congo. Ironic.

s e s

The New Year came to a Davidson campus that
was dark and empty. The sons of Davidson were
spread across the land, arguing with parents, em-
bracing loved ones—missed too long, and realizing
that Christmas only lasts for one day now. Each one
dreaded the return to a cold, grey January, where
egg salad is the only bright spot.

It could be an interesting year for Davidson. A
national basketball championship is certainly not out-
side the realm of possibility. Within that same realm
is the possibility that Davidson will lose a consider-
able group of bright young faculty members if the
infamous Vow is not rescinded. To do away with this
ridiculous requirement should be the first New
Year’s resolution of every trustee. And we got Hom-
er Smith for Christmas. Could 1965 bring us a win-
ning football season? Could be. Princeton plus Air
Force plus Davidson is bound to equal something
better than last year.

And every man at Davidson will spend a great
deal of time wondering about his future and the part
his preparation at Davidson will play in that future.
Some of us will owe every success to the years here;
some might have succeeded if they had not come
here. 1963 will ruin some of us; others will finally
find some meaning in all this conglomeration known

as a “liberal education.”

And so, we do not wish you a happy 1965—just

an exciting one.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Greek Sophomore Calls
Recent Column ‘Tripe’

Dear Editor:

The discussion of Davidson's
fraternity system has, during
the last few weeks. brought ‘to
light some interesting opinions.
most of which have been logical
and well considered. But the
column written by Mike Har-
rington in a recent DAVID-
SONIAN was the most narrow-
minded, ill-conceived tripe 1
have ever read.

Harrington's idea of friendship
starting from a small group and
then growing by selecting and
rejecting is idiotic. Admittedly.
one cannot expect to be close
to everyone on the campus. but
it is only fair to give everyone
just consideration and an equal
opportunity. As Harrington said,
the fraternity has its basis in the
twin principles of selection and
rejection. Then for this reason
fraternities cannot possibly ad-
here to the principles of Christ-
ianity. How can one say that
this is ‘“‘a risky generalization
based on personal bias’? All it
takes to see this point is to be
acquainted with the ‘love ethic”
of Christianity and then sit
through a fraternity balling ses-
sion during Rush Week.

In his column Harrington said
that those students who want to
take part in campus activities
are going to do so whether they
are members of a fraternity or
not. This is not entirely true. It
is generally accepted among the
“cool” fraternity men that the
Independents are of little more
importance than the stray dogs
on campus. This, of course. is
exaggerated, but it still stand to
reason that those who are scorn-
ed by the majority of the Stu-
dent Body are going to keep
to themselves as much as pos-
sible. Needless to say, the num-

ber of students at Davidson who
will stand up for what they be-
lieve is very small.

That the majority of “suc-
cessful” Davidson alumni ar fra-
ternity men is. probably true.
But it is also true that the ma-
jority of the total number of
Davidson graduates were frater-
nity members while attending
school here. It would be inter:
esting to see a proportional
ratio of the successful Indep-
endent alumni to the success-
ful alumni who were fraternity
men.

My main concern over Har-

ington’s column lies in his con-

cept of rejection. That the pos-
sibility of being rejected is en-
countered everywhere in life is
undoubtedly true. But does the
fact that a man was rejected
by a fraternity make him any
better prepared to face rejection
later in life? Perhaps, but the
sting is always going to be great.
If one follows Harrington's logic
in its entirety, it is easy to see
that the sheltered fraternity
man is in for one really bad
time because he is not ready to
be rejected.

I have no sweeping proposals
to make regarding the better-
ment of the situation for every-
one concerned. That must be left
for someone with a better mind
than my’ own. I do recognize.
however, that the Independents
are in a bad social position. The
rest of us cannot afford to ignore
their problems simply because
they are in the minority here.
We owe it to ourselves as much
as we do to them to help them
out of their hole.
