SCHOLARSHIPS DOWN

Davidson Losing Standing
Where It Really Counts?

For years. Davidson has
been billed in academic cir-
eles as a prép schoo! for
graduate schools.

As this year’s Davidson Col-
lege Bulletin’ proudly points
out, nearly 70 per cent of the
college's graduates go on to
higher schools at one time or
another.

Significant. too. has been
Davidson's enviable record
in competition for graduate
scholarships and fellowships.

Recently, however. the
number of ‘‘big name’ schol-
arships won by Davidson's
sons has taken a_ sharp
downward turn.

In the competition for
Woodrow Wilson Fellowships,
for instance, Davidson still
holds the lead over the rest
of the Southeast's colleges.
But statistics indicate that
the Davidson student's prob.
ability of winning one now
is decreasing.

History Majors

Turn To Law

By JOHN PANCAKE
Copy Editor

“Law School” is the answer of many history ma-
jors to the question: What are you doing next year?

In a normal year. and this is a normal year, accord-
ing to Dr. Malcolm Lester, chairman of the History
Department, about half of the senior history majors
go to law school. Lester said only six to 10 of the 45
history majors in the class of ’70 plan to do graduate

work in history.

Other areas of graduate
study for history majors in:
clude business administra
tion, diplomacy and public
affairs, and theology.

Discussing the weight giv.
en scores on the Graduate
Record Examinations. as op
posed to recommendations
and class rank. Lester said
that although the graduate
schools varied, recommenda-
tions and cluss rank were
probably more important. He
pointed out that some. schools,
the University of Virginia be
ing one..do not even require
that applicants take the
GRE's.

Lester said that most Da
vidson graduates attending
Jaw school go to the Univer.
sity of Virginia, Duke - Uni
versity, Vanderbilt Univer.
sity or the University of
North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.

Schools attended by  stu-
dents doing graduate work
in history include Harvard,
Johns Hopkins, Princeton
and the University of South
Carolina. Lester said that
history majors generally
chose graduate schools in the
East: he could not recall
anyone applying to schools
farther west than Chicago or

He said that he did not

SENIOR PONDERS FUTURE

In the 23 years since the
program was begun. a total
of 49 Wilson fellowships have
been awarded Davidson
graduates. Duke University
has won the most in the
Southeast—127. The Univer-
sity of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill has accounted
for 117; the University of
Florida, 65: the University
of the South, 64; and Wash-
ington and Lee University,
35

Davidson graduates won 7
fellowships in the 12 years
from 1945 to 1957, Between
1958 and 1962, 26 were award-
ed to men with Davidson de.
grees. Butlin the next 5-year
period (1963 1967) only 14
awards were received.

This year two Davidson
seniors receiver’ Woodrow
Wilson Fellowships. At this
year’s rate the 5.vear period
ending in 1972 would yield
only. eight Wilsons. Duke ac-
counted for 9 awards, Chapel
Hill for 17, Sewanee for 5,
Washington and Lee for 3
and Florida received 9 this
year.

The Woodrow Wilson is not
the only fellowship which
Davidson students have had
less success in winning.
Though the college stands
ninth in the number of Dan-
forth Fellowships received.

none of the three nominees’

from this year's senior class

One senior was awarded a
Rockefeller Brothers Fellow:

in -succession there was no
Rhodes Scholar.

Davidson at present ranks
fifth in the Southeast in the
number of Rockefeller Broth-
ers Fellowships received: it
stands eighth in the nation.

among liberal arts colleges
in the number of Rhodes
Scholarships. Eight of the 15
Rhodes Scholarships have
been awarded since 1950.

Students are generally nom
inated for graduate awards
by. the Faculty Committee
on Graduate Scholarships.
This committee. chaired dur
ing the past year by Dr.
Richard C. Cole, considers
the applications of all stu.
dents interested in the
awards. and from the list of
applicants it selects a certain
number of nominees.

In some cases the commit
fee meets with the nominces
to help them prepare for the
interviews which they will
encounter in seeking to win
the award. The committee is

For Linguists

The German Department leads this year in the
number of senior language majors. According to Dr.
Thomas O. Pinkerton of the German Department, two
of the seven senior German students will be studying
German in graduate school next year.

Henry Wilmer has won a fellowship in German at
Yale. and Pete Gaskell has been awarded a fellowship
in German at Northwestern.

German major Bobby My.
ers is going to University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill
next year for graduate study
in anthropology. and Bryce
Glothlin plans to teach Ger-
man on the secondary school
level next fall.

Pinkerton said enthusiasm
created by the junior year
abroad had brought greater
numbers of capable students
to German studies in recent
years. Pinkerton offered as
proof of this the fact that
Davidson graduates are now

About 30 Graduates Face
Post-Graduate Army Duty

Based on past experience
Col. Fredrick B. Outlaw es:
timated this week that 25 to
30 newly commissioned Da-
vidson graduates will go on
active duty soon after grad
uation this June.

The remainder of the ap
proximately 140 to be com-
missioned at graduation will
be in graduate and profes
sional schools — deferring
their active duty for later
years. he said.

Many of the seniors have
not yet received notification
of deferment, according to

Outlaw, and some have
changed their minds after
receiving their deferments.

Outlaw said 42 of the sen-
jors got their first branch
choice and a small number
got their second choice.

“The. remainder for the
most part got their selected
third choice," Outlaw added.

ROTC Department figures
show that of the 14 branch
choices, medical service, in.
telligence, and adjutant gen-
eral were the most popular
first choices of the graduat-
ing seniors. Engineering. ar-

tillery, armor, and infantry
were among the least popu-
lar as first. choices. Armor
was the only branch not re-
quested by anyone.

“The Davidson graduate is
looking for a branch which
will allow him to work in his
preferred field of work,”
Outlaw said.

Outlaw added that David.
son graduates do better in
branch schools than most
other ROTC officers. He said
that the unit here has an
outstanding record for the
past four years.

Dr. Jobn B. Gallent said
that the average over the last
few years has been about
four per year going to grad.
uate school after majoring
in chemistry here. He said
last year students in chem-
istry went to Rutgers. the
University of Ilinois, and two
to University of North Caro
lina at Chapel Hill.

In. previous years gradu
ates in chemistry have gone,
to Johns Hopkins. Columbia.
Ohio State, Wisconsin and
Auburn.

The Davidson Chemistry
Department is on the ap
proved list of the American
Chemical Society, a list which
includes about 335 colleges.
and universities across the
nation. said Gallent. Only
about 90 of the approved de
partments are in liberal arts
colleges. he said.

Standards for the ACS ap.
proved list include staff load,
library, labs, general qual
ity, and success of students
who go on to graduate school
from the department, Gallent
said.

Gallent explained that there
are signs all over the nation
that liberal arts colleges are
producing fewer and fewer
graduates in the sciences. He
said that both the sciences
and the humanitics have
Claimed losses to the other
in recent years. but recent
studies indicate that the loss-
es in both areas may bé at-
tributed to greatly increased
attraction of economics and
tusiness oppportunities.

Though impossible to pre-
dict what will happen in the
future, Gallent said, “The
topflight liberal arts colleges
have produced in the past
the baccalaureate sources for
a major fraction of PhD's
in natural science.”

Dr. John I. Hopkins, chair.
man of the Physics Depart-
ment, noted a decrease in
physics majors at Davidson
in the last few. years. Hop-
kins said that a drop in phys-
ics majors in recent years
all across the nation may
help explain the reduction in
physics majors here.

“Science majors may be
applying to Davidson and
just not coming here,'’ said
Hopkins. He speculated that

more extensive lab equip.
ment at larger. universities

may offer an attraction to:

science majors that a. Hberal
arts college cannot afford.

Hopkins said that Davidson
used to produce seven or
eight’ physics... majors per

year. But that’ was 10 years -

ago. For the last few. years
only one or two -physics ma-
jors have come out of David.
son each year.

Yet. men who have gradu
ated in physics’ have done

Law Appeals To
In Poli Sci, Other Areas

By BILL SEIGLER
Associate Editor

Although several ‘seniors
have received fellowships or
assistantships for graduate
study in political science.

most of the students in this °

department. and many in va-
rious other departments plan
to attend law schools next
year.

Information «available at
this: time is somewhat sket
chy and tentative in that
many of the seniors interest-
ed in these fields have not
~et made up their minds as
to the school they will at.
tend.

According to Dr. W. P.
Minter, political science ad-
visor. several students among
the “unusually good bunch of
seniors’ majoring in polit.
ical science this vear have
received assistantship offers.

Sixteen seniors in all are
majoring in political science.
Gus Cochran, a winner of a
Woodrow Wilson Scholarship.
has been offered an assist
antship at the University of
Indiana.

Accepting assistantship cf.
fers at the ‘University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill

‘were Tom Peddicord and Ju-

lian Prosser. Peddicord will
do graduate work in political
science and Prosser in public
administration.

Art Abplanalp and Sam
Hiines, alsa political science
majors, will be doing grad-
uate work in that field next
year at Duke University.

An economics major, Mike
Powell, has accepted a schol
arship at Texas‘in public ad-
ministration.

The prospective law stu.
dents come from many de
partments besides political
science. including history.
economics and English.

_ Minter estimated that about
4 seniors were planning to
attend law school but said
that. information was incom.
plete as yet.

A tentative listing of stu-
dents and law schools they
will attend is as follows:

Chicago—Mason Stephenson

Columbia --Tim Rothermil

considerably better than the

boards, averaging about 20
points higher.

Although some students
have had @ifficulty getting
into the school of their first

that he had not “heard of
anybody that failed to get in

“The fact that. we have a
broad liberal arts background
here.” Minter continued,
“gives our students an ‘ad-
vantage over those at a lot
of other schools in general
