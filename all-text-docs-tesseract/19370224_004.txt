»Y YATES FAISON

Will our basketball team be ten-
dered a bid to the coming South-
ern Conference tourney in Raleigh?
That's what everyone seems to be
talking about. No one knows but
there are a few definite facts to be
considered,

Davidson is actually in tenth
place in the conference standings
based on conference games. The
Wildcats have won five games
against eight losses. The V. M. I.
Kaydets and Maryland’s Ole Liners
still have a chance to nose out
Coach Laird’s charges. Both have
won four games, lost eight. The
Ole Liners have a hope, as the
drawings are to be made on their
home grounds, but they must still
face the State Red Terrors. The
Cadets have games with two of the
tail-enders, V. P. I. and William &
Mary, and last of all, with Virginia.
Who can tell?

We started a campaign at the end
of the football season to get a
berth in this cage tournament, and
the outcome is still in’ the balance
It is unfortunate that there are so
many splendid teams in the Old
North State this year. We sti!l hope}
for those game Wildcats, but re-
member that old saying to the effect
that it matters not whether you won

or lost but how you played the
game,
Still A Sport
The unnerving climax of the
wrestling match Saturday with N.

C. State raised quite a furor. When
the match came to the final bout,
in the unlimited class, the score
stood at 12-11 in favor of State. Due
to illegal tactics the match was
awarded to Howard McFadyen, and
with it the match to Davidson, by
virtue of a 16-12 score. The State
entrant was in disfavor with the
crowd, but he did a sporting thing
in coming to McFadyen to apologize
and explain.

It seems that he was new to the
sport of wrestling and had only been
out for ten days. He wasn’t in tip-
top shape and knew he must pin
McFadyen in two minutes or lose
himself. He was ignorant of the
rules and he was doing the only
thing he could to win. You see,
here again, there are always two
sides to every situation.

Incidentally, I talked to this man
on Friday afternoon for a good
while about the State football’ sit-
uation. He chatted amiably and
seemed to ‘be a true gentleman. He
is from the north, but he has an
open mind about the “mixed ele-
ment” dispute at State. He is a
sophomore and is there on an ath-
letic scholarship. Some of his facts
were enlightening as to the true
state of affairs in Raleigh,

State Spirit
oie thing that was surprising was
his logical explanation, whether true
or not, of the difference in spirit
at State as compared with David-
son. He claims the work is harder
(hark, ye intellectual grumblers).
He went on to show in his case he
is studying engineering, and itis
virtually impossible for him to min-
gle with and know his fellow stu-
dents. Thus all spirit is crushed!
SPRING MANIA

Spring begins her invasion of the
campus sport life. -Soon the crack
of horse-hide against bat and those
raucous yells, so endearing to the
diamond fan, will become a regular
Part of campus’ activity. Coach
Laird is starting his season in a

drums. Pitchers are most needed,
so all you potential Hubbels and
Deans come on out and give your-
self a chance to develop.

Whew, after a month’s lay-off,
this col writing a hope-
less task. But we'll all be there in
Raleigh yet—to cheer for our team!

FOOTBALL SCRIMMAGE

Red Team Defeats Plucky
Grays By 12-6 Score

this year.

The first scrimmage game of the
spring season was held Monday,
Feb. 22, the Reds scoring a 12-6 vic-
tory over the plucky Grays.

The Reds were given the ball on
the first play and after Lafferty
picked up some yardage on three
line plays he punted to the Grays’
forty, where it was downed. Hand,
Gray quarterback, then punted far
up the field. Lafferty grabbed the
ball and started sprinting down the
field but was swamped by a wave
of Gray players. The Reds contin-
ued up the field and crossed the
goal on a pass from Lafferty to
Williams,

The pigskin then see-sawed back
and forth, the Reds having the up-
per hand most of the time. Both
teams pushed far down the field on
long drives but couldn’t break
through the other’s iron defense
for a score Then Johnny Sadler
ran wild on a 60 yard dash, slipped
past the out-maneuvered Reds to
score a touchdown. This blow en-
raged the Reds and they swept
down the field.| Lafferty scored a
touchdown on another 60, yard run.

CLOSING

CAREER

Shown above is MAURICE PEABODY, who is playing his third
year on the Wildcat Varsity. Although he is one of the quintet’s
leading scorers he is a fine team player and probably the best passer
on the squad. Peabody’s constant ringing of long shots at crucial
moments has been invaluable to the team.

Baby Deacons

Final Contest Dropped By
Davidson Frosh

The freshman basketball team
closed an in and out season in the
home gym last Saturday night as
they dropped a 27-46 decision to the
Wake Forest freshmen. This game
was a preliminary tothe varsity
Davidson-Wake Forest clash.

The Davidson frosh, led by Tho-
mas and Phipps, had flashed their
best form of the season up until
the last ten minutes of the game
and were trailing 23-24 at that point.
Then the Wake Forest attack be-
gan to click and the Davidson frosh
were unable to stem the Baby Dea-
con scorers, who had _ previously
gained a victory over the Wildkit-
tens at Wake Forest.

Although the season would be
considered unsuccessful from the
won and lost standpoint, Coach

Chet Chapman did some fine work
with the limited, green material on
hand, and doubtless helped some
freshmen along who will see var-
sity in to come,
Throughott the only the
strongest opposition was met, and
the play of the frosh was at times

Team To Be Built Around
Carlson, Kenney, Framp-
ton and Boggs

With the return of Harry Framp-
ton, regular on last year's varsity
netters, to school, the prospects for
the tennis team this year are ex-
ceedingly bright. Frampton, who
turned out to be the season’s find
as a sophomore, played in the fifth
position, and he is expected to reach
even greater heights this year, hav-
ing had a season of experience
playing as a regular on the varsity
team.

The team this year will be built
around such stalwarts as Captain
Carlson, Frampton, Boggs, and
Kenney and with these four play-
ers forming the nucleus, the varsity
racquet men should really go
places this season. The team will
not be chosen until after the spring
tournament. Carlson, winner of the
fall tournament, and Kenney, who
was runner up to Carlson, will be
seeded first and second respectively.
Other members of the squad who
are among the outstanding  pros-
pects for a position on the team are
Feuchtenberger, White, Herzog,
Sloan, Jones, and Woodward.

The courts are being prepared and
all the courts will be in perfect
shape for the tournament which is
scheduled to start around the first
of March. Five new nets have been
bought and courts are now being
reserved for members of the varsity
squad who wish to practice.

The tentative schedule for this
yeatis as follows:

Date School Place
March 18—N. C. State here.

March 22—Presbyterian there.
March 23—South Carolina there.
March 24—Emory there.

March 25—Georgia Teck there
March 26—Mercer there.

March 29—Rollins College there.
March 31—Furman there.

April 3—North Carolina here.

Iverson, Quick and Peabody
Lead Week’s Play

J

The Wildcat basketeers went in-
to a slump last week and came out
on the short end of the score in
two out of their three games.

Playing their last conference
game of the season, they met the
Deacons of Wake Forest here in
Alumni Gymnasium Saturday night
and went down by a 44-33 score.
Coach Red Laird started a combi-
nation composed of Iverson, Pea-
body, Hicks, Quick and Tice — the
quintet that downed the Deacons on
their home court the previous week.
For several minutes the two teams
played on even terms, but then
Wake Forest, led by its sensational
sophomore forward, Jim Waller, be-
gan ta forge ahead. Time after
time Captain Quick rallied his team
but the Lairdmen re unable to
stop the high-flying Déacons, who
led at half time by 26 to 1h

Cut Lead

In the second half the Cats could
not cut down the Deacons’ lead,
staying just eleven points behind
most of the time. Bill Quick played
best for Davidson’s quintet, scoring
8 points, Iverson and Peabody fol-
lowed him with 7 counters each.
For Wake Forest, Waller was out-
standing. Using a one-handed, over-
head shot that was impossible to
guard, the Deacon ace rolled up 14
points, shooting from all angles.
During the game he shot at the
basket seven times. Six of them
swished through without touching
the rim and the other rolled around
the rim several times. and finally

.dropped outside. His other. twe
points were garnered on free
throws.

Thursday night in Columbia the
‘Cats dropped a fast and _ well-
played contest to the Gamecocks of
South Carolina, 4Q to 29. Ned Iver-
son was high-point man for David-
son with 8, followed by Kiesewetter
with 5. Podge Hutto, dynamic
guard, led the winners with 12 tal-
lies.

Beat Charleston

In a non-conference game _ the
Cats defeated the College of Char-
leston for the second time this sea-
son here Wednesday. The substi-
tutes played most of the contest for
Davidson and rendered a very good
account of themselves.

By virtue of their losses to Wake
Forest and South Carolina, the Cats
slipped back to tenth place in the

conference. However, they are still

in the running for a bid to the tour-
