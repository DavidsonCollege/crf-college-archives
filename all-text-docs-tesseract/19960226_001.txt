Students react to

potential keg ban

Students speculate about reprocussions

By Apam HIcKEy
Staff Writer

“All that it’s going to do is
create more dispersion,” said one
freshman pledge about akeg ban at
Davidson. “It’s just going to move
the problem [of alcohol consump-
tion] to different areas.”

Such response comes on the
heels of a Self-Study Office report
which recommends Davidson ex-
pand the ban on kegs from the
Residence halls to encompass all
of the college property, fraternities
and eating houses included.

While no ban is in effect now,
most everyone from the Dean’s
Office to the Residence Life Of-
fice to Patterson Court Council
expects one to be in place soon.

Though not wanting to make
official predictions, Dean of Stu-
dents Tom Shandley “doesn’t ex-
pect that it won’t pass. I don’t
expect that if it happens it. will

happen before next fall.”

The Council on Campus and
Religous Life, chaired by
Shandley, would make a recom-
mendation for such an alcohol
policy change to the President, who
will choose whether or not to pass
it on to the Trustees for implemen-
tation.

Though one student called it
“a cover-up for gradually eradicat-
ing the Greek system,” most ad-
ministrators and students directly
involved with the recommenda-
tion see other motives.

“T think the general motive is
liability and a return to following
the guidelines set by national fra-
ternities,” said John Cowan, PCC
President and Phi Delta Theta
brother.

Currently, the national frater-
nity chapters forbid the presence
of kegs and the purchase of alcohol

presidential
search committee

Among many qualified appli-
cants, four Davidson students were
recently chosen to participate in a
unique opportunity to help shape
the future of Davidson College.

The group will be “working
with faculty and trustees to inter-
view nominees for [Davidson Col-
’ lege] president,” says Lucy
Sherman, Freshman Class Presi-
dent and member of the SGA com-

mittee which selected the students
from among approximately 23 ap-
plicants.

The four students nominated
by the SGA committee and ap-
proved by the entire SGA include
John Bell ‘99, Carrie Blackburn
‘97, Liz Sale ‘98, and David Wick
‘97. SGA President Warren Buford
will serve as the group’s fifth mem-
ber.

Although the group’s role is
currently “very ambiguous,”

OUT WITH A BANG

Brandon “Ozone” Williams led Davidson, tallying 20 of his 26 total points in the decisive
second half including this thunderous dunk, as the Wildcats (22-3, 13-0) moved one step
away from an undefeated record in the Southern Conference. The triumph marked the
last appearance in Belk Arena for seniors Chris Alpert, Quinn Harwood, Jeff Anderson, _
Mark McGuire, and Williams. The team plays tonight at Furman in the regular season
finale before heading to Greensboro for this weekend’s conference tournament. See

Self-study recommends more minority professors

By JONATHAN SIPLING
Staff Writer

Many colleges are cutting back
on promises of affirmative action.

Self Study Series

Davidson’s Self Study, however,
is recommending that the college
continue on its current path of re-
cruiting minorities.

Citing the low number of Af-
rican-American faculty and sala-
ried administrators at Davidson,
the recently released 1995-96 Self-
Study chided Davidson for not
aggressively pursuing qualified
black candidates for employment.

This academic year, four Af-
rican-American professors are
teaching at Davidson, and only one
has tenure. As of November 1995,
eight African-Americans held sala-
ried administrative posts.

According to the Focus Group
on Student Experience, which
authored the section of the Self
Study dealing with this issue, “The
dearth of black role models can
only perpetuate the idea that
Davidson is a ‘white’ campus.”

Recognizing that graduate
programs in certain academic dis-
ciplines, such as physics, math,
and economics, turn out a
disproportionally low percentage
of African-American PhDs, the

focus group suggested that the col-
lege take aggressive action to iden-
tify and hire available African-
Americans in these areas.

In other areas, including the
humanities and social sciences,
there are larger numbers of Afri-
can American PhDs, whom the
committee says the College sim-
ply is not competing intensely
enough to attract.

They say Davidson also should
be more active in its pursuit of

African-American professionals,
well represented in our geographic
area, for administrative positions.

The Self-Study also included
specific suggestions to help in-
crease the numbers of African-
American faculty and administra-
tors on campus.

The study says, “All academic
and administrative departments
should be continually reminded of
