By Sara Carlson and Jonathan
Harris

On Wednesday, March 25 over

two hundred people gathered in

the 900 room of the Union at“Take_

Back the Night,” an awareness rally
designed to educate the Davidson

community aboutissues.of sexual ~

assault and to empower: all assault

survivors.

Adriana Tavernise, a junior
English major from Northern Vir-
ginia, introduced the event with a
reading of excerpts from “Rape
Poem,” by Marge Piercy. Ms.
Tavernise, a rape survivor herself,
urged the audience to respect the
gravity of the issues about to be
presented. She invited those pres-
entto reflect on the courage neces-
sary to speak.

“What really makes me an-
gry?” the first speaker demanded,
“That nobody ever told me I was
right. Nobody ever took me aside
and said, girl, your body is yoursto
love and care for. You can not

entrust it to anyone else.” She

described in detail the conse-
quences of sexual assault in her
own life, emphasizing the silence
that surrounded and still surrounds
. theactofrape. She concluded by
saying, “I have changed. Ihave a
voice now, and I’m speaking. No
one can take me away from me
ever again.” 2

Director and

By Kevin Miller

Colin Shaw Smith, director of
Davidson’s Student Union for over
30 years, died Sunday, March 22
in his home in Davidson. Smith, a
mainstay in Davidson for most of
his life, was also known for his
traveling family magic act, Smcy
Sorcery.

A graduate of Davidson in

counseled other survivors to re-
member that they are not alone in
their pain. Ms. Richter, a senior
music major, performed two in-
spirational songs by pop artist Amy
Grant.

Laura Preuss, a survivor of
attempted rape by a Davidson stu-
dent, bravely-described herattack.
Though she prosecuted through
‘the Dean of Students office, she
and herattacker occasionally meet

‘accidentally, as he still attends
school here. Through her testi-
mony, she hoped to make others
aware that sexual assault exists at
Davidson.

The final speaker, a man who
feels victimized by sexual assault,
described his incapacity to bridge
the distance between himselfanda
woman survivor whom he loves.
He feels that her assault makes it
impossible for her to love freely.
Hecriticized a society whichoften
persecutes the victim more thor-
oughly than it does the attacker. In
closing, he said that all people are
affected negatively by sexual as-
sault.

Allthe speakers reiterated that
asurvivor has the right to be angry
and to be heard no matter what her
reputation, dress, or sobriety at the
time of the attack.

As they exited the Union, each
person who had been sexually

CCRL, Dean of Students
‘ Review Second Version of
Proposed Alcohol Policy

By Tom Koonce and Tom
‘Price

Currently the Committee on
Campus and Religious Life and
Dean of Students Will Terry are
reviewing a revised version of the
alcohol policy which was presented
by Dean Terry two weeks ago.
Like the: first version, this new
policy is still open to “review,
amendment, and suggestions.”

The CCRL will work with
Terry tocomposea policy that is as
simple as possible. The final ver-
sion of the new alcohol policy will

be sent to President Kuykendall .

for approval after being passed by
the CCRL. Kuykendall will then
send out the proposal to the Trus-

tees who will make the final deci-
sion on the policy in a mecting on
April 23.

This past Thursday night only
thirty-three students showed up to
discuss the alcohol policy in a fo-
rum sponsored by the SGA. A
panel that consisted of Eric Rosen-
bach, freshmen (and rising sopho-
more) class president; Ann Todd,
Union president; David Wright,
PCC chairman; Cris Edmonston,
chairman SGA ad-hoc committee
on the alcohol policy, and Alicé
Spivey, member of the CCRL
answered questions from students
about the new policy. SGA Presi-
dent Anthony Foxx mediated the
forum.

Sophomore Will Canu com-
mented that Patterson Court is not
the problem. He stated his belief
that the problem is that there aren’t
a whole lot of social options at
Davidson. Canu also asked the
panel whether or not this might
lead toa dry campus. Members of
the panel responded that this would
not happen because the Trustees
realize a dry campus wouldn’t
work.

Wright mentioned theneed for
student support and talked of the
low turnout at the forum. A panel
member said, “What would help
us is good ideas to reach the objec-

and Relief Efforts in Nicaragua

«= By: Will Boye

~~ Last Thursday, the Dean Rusk
program Welcomed ‘three distinc-
tive speakers. Reverend Bill Cal-
lahan, Ketxu Amazua, and Esper-
anza Cruz de Cabrera spoke in the
900 Room about the today’s state
of affairs in Nicaragua. Focusing
upon the work of the Quest for
Peace organization in the impover-
ished country, the speakers illus-
trated the need for peaceful rela-
tions between the United States
and Nicaragua by presenting those

conditions fis of living that continue

,.to demand attention.

Reverend Bill Callahan, ‘Na-
tional Coordinator for the Quest
for Peace organization, began the
evening by providing a brief back-
ground on the group. In 1984,
when the war between the Sandan-
istas and the Contras was gaining
momentum, Callahan and several
others worked for a temporary
program of emergency medical
service. In 1985, however, after
the U.S. administration launcheda

$27 million campaign towards the
toppling of the Sandanista govern-
ment, Callahan established an
organization designed to raise an
equal amount of money in opposi-
tion to this foreign policy - one that
would work towards friendship and
peace with the Nicaraguan people.
Reaching. $20 million in a
successful fund-raising campaign,
Quest for Peace continued to solocit
aid for its cause, following its first

and Predicts on Post Cold War Future

By John David Semones

On Tuesday March 24 the Dean
Rusk program sponsored former
Davidson Political Science profes-
sor Dr. Harold Ford in the 900
Room. Ford’s talk, “Tomorrow’s
World and the Enormity of its
Hazards,” focused on the present
state of the world and included
some of his own predictions for the
future. i

After teaching at Dayidson

from 1955-57, Dr. Ford began a30
year career with the CIA. In 1989
he won an award for his book Es-
timated Intelligence. Mostrecently
he testified against the nomination
of Bob Gates as head of the CIA
and against new legislation to re-
vamp the CIA.

As opposed to the first half of
this century, Ford said,“There is
no longer the relative certainty of
what we are up against.” How-

ever, Ford did cite the former Soviet
Union as a major target for world
dilemma. oe

“The White House’s task is a
necessary oneeven though thecold
war is over. The former Soviet
Unionis near Beruitism, and thatis
anarchy.” Ford expressed con-
cern that the West doesn’t have
billions of dollars to pour into the
