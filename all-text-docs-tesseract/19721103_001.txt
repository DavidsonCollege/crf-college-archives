Board Of Trustees
To Meet In Winter

On Financial Woes

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

The Davidson Board of
Trustees at its fall meeting on
Oct. 26-27 decided tu call a
special Trustee meeting in late
February to discuss. the
financial problems facing the
college.

According to Trustee
Chairman Warner L. Hall, the
Trustees are deeply concerned
about the steep climb in
operating costs during the past
few years. He said these cost
increases have necessitated
periodic increases in student
tuition and endowment.

At this meeting the Trustees
will attempt to formulate a new
policy in regard to the operating
budget, endowment, and tuition
increases.

Another reason for the
meeting according to Hall is
because, ‘‘Coeducation is going
to put a strain on the budget,”
and the Trustees will have to
take precautionary steps.

In other business the Trustees
gave approval for WDAV to
apply for an F.M. license.
WDAV will be allowed to apply
only for a 10 watt license, which
is less than what the station
had hoped for.

Hall said a_ Trustee
committee had recommended
this wattage because certain
administrators and Trustees
had voiced doubts about the
high cost of a radio station and
the danger of irresponsible
students gaining control of the

station.

The Trustees adopted the
recommendation of the
committee which had studied
the radio station, but Hall said,
“This does not preclude
expansion in the years to come.
I personally am gung ho about
the station.”

According to Earl W.
Lawrimore, WDAV advisor, it
will be at least a year until
WDAV will be able to broadcast
F.M. WDAV will then be able to
reach the towns of Davidson
and Cornelius, which is far less
than its original goal of
broadcasting to Charlotte.

The Trustees also heard a
report from the administration
in regard to blacks at Davidson.
Hall said the Trustees
encouraged the administration
to continue its efforts to
increase black students and
faculty members.

Hall said, ‘‘You' can't
legislate the number of black
students or faculty members.
Finding fully competent black
faculty members is a difficult
undertaking. Making a lot of
promises we could not keep
would not be in good faith."

The Trustees did not discuss
the controversy over whether
the requirement that all
members of the faculty be

‘Christians be maintained,

according to Hall. He said this
matter was referred to the
Executive Committee of the
Trustees, and it would be dealt
with at a later meeting.

Recess Begins Monday

Asst. Managing Editor

Freshmen will meet with
their faculty advisors on
Monday and Tuesday to review
their first six weeks at
Davidson and to plan how they
will spend the rest of their time
here.

Dean of Students Will Terry,
who orgnaized the Freshman
Conference recess, said, ‘‘It

For Fowarding Of Transcript

By MIKE TANNER
Asst. Managing Editor

Despite student government
protest, the administration
announced this week that the $2
transcript fee will not be
lowered.

According to the
administration, the cost of
processing the transcript is
$2.79, while the SGA maintains
that the cost should be no more
than $ .50.

From figures obtained from
the Registrar and released
through the comptroller's
office, the expense of the
transcript is the sum of the cost
of the materials and the work
hours of the secretary who
compiles the transcript forms

McGovern Over Nixon

mM McGovern defeated Nixon in the straw polls conducted
Wednesday by the Open End Committee of the Student
Union. Of the 4129 students voting, 242 voted for McGovern,

f 181 for Nixon and 6 for Schmitz. Among the faculty and staff,
McGovern won 35 votes to Nixon's 18.

Senior class, McGovern--78.6%, Nixon--21.3%,.

Last year, Kurt Geisener,
operating for the student
Senate, also evaluated the
transcript compilation process
in terms of material cost and
secretarial labor and found that
total cost came to roughly $ .50.

Student Body President
Ralph Peeples commented on
the situation saying that the
college's figures represent
inflated material costs and
exaggerated labor.

‘I don't see that the factor of
secretatial labor should be
included at all; their salary is
constant with or without
transcript work," Peeples said.

The materials include a letter
to the receiving institution

introducing the student,
envelope, an acknowledgement
postcard (heralding the
transcript itself), a form letter
explaining the Davidson credit
system and the reproduction of
the student's record which is
the transcript. The total cost of
these is $ .29. The cost of the
secretary's time to compile
cae 2S the total being
1.05.

The expense of the transcript
supplemental is the same as the
original transcript, putting the
overall price at $2.10.

In addition to this basic cost,
45.17 percent (according to
Federal Government
regulations) of the indirect
salaries of all employees
involved in the process is to be
included in the transcript price.
This indirect cost is $ .69, thus
making the total cost of the
transcript $2.79, for which the
college now charges $2.00, $1.00
more than last year.

But according to Peeples, “If
the cost of the transcript .were
$2.79, the college would charge
$3.00: it amazes me to what
lengths the college will go to in
order to make money off
students.”

do more in the area of academic
advising. This is an opportunity
for the freshmen to think in
terms of the whole four years.

“There is no point in spending
$13,000 6n an education and then
throwing a schedule together in
five minutes,” Terry said.

“I'd like to see the freshmen
and their advisors brainstorm
through the catalog and see just
what they would like to take,”
he said. “It's important to
emphasize that this recess is
not just for planning the Winter
Term schedule."

Professor of English Tony
Abbott explained that the
abolition of the quarter system
had eliminated the mid-
semester grade report which
had previously been a time
when freshmen and their
advisors worked out problems.

“This recess will serve as a
planning session for a potential
major and long-range goals,”
said Abbott. ‘‘Its primary
purpose is to help people before
it's too late."

The first item on the recess
agenda is a General Knowledge
Inventory Test. Vice President
of Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan explained that this test is
designed to give some kind of
picture of what freshmen are
like when they come to
Davidson.

The test will include material
on problem solving and decision
making. The test will be
repeated at the end of the
sophomore year so that the
college can determine what sort
of progress students make here.

A second test will be given at
the end of the sophomore and
senior years in the area of the
student's major.

‘I've been charged with
discerning certain things about
the quality of the academic
program,’ Bevan said.

*‘We want to get an idea of
how Davidson College taps,
strengthens, and weakens some
of the things that make up a

man’s humanness. We want to
see what four years here does to
a person,” he said.

Bevan pointed out that the
tests are purely for research
purposes and will not go into the
student's academic record.

One more aspect of the recess
is the freshman-advisor field
day. Intermural Director Chip
Stone said the events will
include tennis doubles, volley
ball, four-on-four half-court
basketball, handball, a two and
a half mile bike race, a run on
the cross country course and
flickerball.

Coed Letter

Nonexistent

Despite rumors to the
contrary, no letters
discouraging prospective coeds
have been mailed by the
Admissions Office, according to
Director of Admissions H.
Edmunds White.

Apparently several coeds
understood that the college was
sending out letters to coeds,
who had expressed an interest
in Davidson, that said that few
coeds would be admitted next
year.

“No letter even intimating
such a policy has been sent out
of this office,” said White.
“We've worked too hard to get
coeds. We certainly don't want
to discourage any."

White did say, however, that
the college was discouraging
male transfers for next year.
because they would cut down on
the number of women, the
college could house.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan said that
next week the college would
make a final decision on exactly
how many coeds and freshmen
the college will be able to
accomodate for next vear.

Bevan said that the main
problem in this regard was
finding enough housing in the
town.
