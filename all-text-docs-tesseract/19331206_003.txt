welfth Birthday

Physics Organization
_ Founded At Davidson

Dr. J. M. Douglas, Who Helped
Organize Fraternity, Is Still
Active in Group

FOUNDED DECEMBER 11

Fraternity Now Has Chapters in
26 Leading Colleges

When nine physics students and fac-
ulty members gathered at the home
of Dr. J. M. Douglas here twelve years
ago for the purpose of creating an
organization which would bring those
particularly interested in this science
into closer association for their mutual
benefit, little did they realize that they
were establishing a fraternity which
was to bring honor and distinction to
the school in which it was founded.

Monday, December 11, marks the
twelfth anniversary of the founding
of Sigma Pi Sigma as a local organ-
ization at Davidson College which has
since grown to be the only national
honorary physics fraternity having
chapters in the recognized colleges and
universities. At first the organizers of
Sigma Pi Sigma were not concerned
with the extension of their project,
but after three years, because the lo-
cal fraternity had been so ‘successful
in promoting its aims, a movement for
nationalism was launched.

The first expansion was to Duke
University in 1925, and in consecutive
years chapters were installed at Penn-
sylvania State and Centenary colleges,
until at the present time there are 26
chapters scattered over the United
States and in the Philippines. Among
the leading universities in which-chap-
ters of Sigma Pi Sigma have been
installed are Chicago, Perdue, Wash-
ington, West Virginia, Kentucky,
Oklahoma, and Colorado.

The membership of the physics or-
ganization classified into active,
alumni, and honorary, The fraternity
now has more than 1,500 members,
scattered over 37 different states and
in six foreign countries. The present
honorary membership includes such
notables as A. H. Compton, of Chi-
cago; K. T. Compton, president of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Cambridge; F. K. Ricktmyer, of Cor-
nell University; Carl K. Darrow, of
the Bell Telephone Company; Cor-
nelius Lanezos, of Princeton Univer-
sity; W. F. G. Swan, of the Bottle Re-
search Foundation; W. S. Lee, of
Charlotte, and other prominent physi-
cists.

is

Much of the success of Sigma Pi
Sigma, especially during the early
years of its organization and expan-
sion, is due to the efforts of Dr. J. M.
Douglas, head of the Davidson physics
department, who, besides aiding in the
foundation of the fraternity, has been
active and able creating interest
and enthusiasm since its beginning.

in

Sigma Pi Sigma has for its objective
the fostering and encouragement of
scholarship, research, and the creation
and stimulation of interest in physics.
It makes possible common ground for
the discussion and development of
physics by both faculty and students.
Recently the fraternity became affili-
ated with the Institute of Physics so
that members of Sigma Pi Sigma now
share in the publications privileges of

» the institute.

Several times each year a publica-
tion, titled “Radiations of Sigma Pi
Sigma,” 4s compiled at the national
headquarters and sent to members of
the fraternity. The journal usually
contains more than 60 pages of infor-
mation concerning the activities of the
chapters of the fraternity and of its
members.

It is now an established policy of
Sigma Pi Sigma to hold two national
conventions each year, to which dele-
gates from each chapter are sent.
These meetings are held in connection
with those of the American Physical
Society.

Much consideration has been given
by the fraternity to the finding of po-
sitions for graduates in physics, and
it will push the study of this problem
aggressively in the hope of being able
to place more of its members after
their undergraduate work has been
completed. Sigma Pi Sigma also makes
investigations and encourages its mem-
bers to enter such fields as the med-
ical profession, X-ray specialist and
technicians, bio-physics, and air-con-
ditioning. Each chapter of Sigma Pi
Sigma maintains a scholastic award
each year for oneof its graduating
members.

fic Company, is national president of

of R. C. Colwell,,of West Virginia
University; R. C. Young, of William
and Mary; D. W. Cornelius, of the
University of Chattanooga; F. A. May,

Douglas, of Davidson College. Dr.
Douglas is also chancellor of the
council.,

Every chapter holds two meetings
each month, at which time papers are
read and current developments in
physics are given and discussed by
the members. Each chapter tries to
have two open meetings each year,
before which groups some outstanding
man in his field is selected to speak.

The Alpha Chapter here has since
its establishment held a high place
among honorary fraternities at David-
Its present officers include J. -E.
Dill, president; E. C. Snead, vice-
president, and W. M. Bogart, secre-
tary-treasurer. Professor H. E. Ful-
cher, of the department, is faculty ad-
visor. Professor Fulcher, together with
Dr. Douglas, has been very active in
the organization. At the first national
convention of Sigma Pi Sigma, held
at Davidson in 1927, Professor Fulcher
was elected national executive secre-
tary, in which capacity he served two
years.

Faculty members associated with the
Davidson chapter include, in addition
to Dr. Douglas and Professor Fulcher,
Dr, J. L. Douglas and Professors W.
N. Mebane and W. W. Wood. Be-

Elrath, W. A. Parker, J. H. Powell,
A. S. Rachal, and J. W. White.

To obtain membership a sophomore
must have three semesters in physics
with an average of 95. A junior or
senior must have three semesters in
the course with an average of 90. In-
terest in physics is another require-
ment for membership. The organiza-
tion limits its membership to three per
cent of.the student body in any one
year.

Enoch, who is well over sixty years
of age, enjoys the distinction of being
Davidson’s oldest and most faithful
janitor. Every morning at seven, he
can be found busy at work, keeping
the many halls and rooms of Chambers
in order, and tending to countless
other things which fall to his lot. His
job is a hard one, but he never com-
plains, and goes about his work in
a cheerful manner.

Born at the close of the Civil War,
Enoch has seen many changes in the
life and customs of the people in and
around Davidson.

According to him, the present cam-
pus was at first a bare unenclosed plot,
dotted here and there by tall pines.
However, to remedy this,.the students
declared a holiday every March, and
this holiday was used to plant grass
and set ott trees. This custom con-
tinued for several years and the cam-
pus we have now is a gratifying re-
sult of this plan, A lake was also
located on the campus, at the site of
what is now the golf course.

During the burning of Chambers in
1921, he was sent to the roof of Geor-
gia to keep the sparks from burning
it. Evidently, this was a hard job be-
cause Enoch “wore out a whole pair

Besides being an all-round good

Honorary Fraternities
Begin Activities Again

The honorary fraternities on the
campus have resumed activity since
the recent interruption of their pro-
grams through the initiation of pledges.
A list of the presidents of these fra-
ternities appeared in the last issue of
The Davidsonian. However, a correc-
tion is due. Jack Williams, and not
James White, as it appeared on that
list, is president of Omega Phi Alpha.

Omicron Delta Kappa held its first
meeting since the initiation of pledges
last Tuesday evening, where objectives
for the year were discussed.

Sigma Upsilon met Tuesday evening
to discuss plans for the-titerary life of
the college and its publications.

Alpha Phi Epsilon will meet Thurs-
day evening to select new members, to
be chosen from those men who have
shown debating and oratorical ability.

Gamma Sigma Epsilon held a meet-
ing Monday evening to discuss the
of new members, selected
from those who have done unusually
well in the study of chemistry.

Delta Phi. Alpha held a meeting
Tuesday evening at the Social Center,

initiation

at which time James White gave a
book Wood dis-
cussed plays, from
which one will be selected for pres-
entation by the club at a later date.

Delta Pi-Kappa has arranged for a
meeting for Wednesday, December 13,
but no definite plans were available
for this issue. This fraternity is a lo-
cal one recognizing literary ability in
college -publications.

Sigma Delta Pi held a meeting
Tuesday evening to complete the plans
that had been opened for discussion
the previous meeting in regard to the
development of programs relating to
the language and customs of Spain
and Latin-America.
