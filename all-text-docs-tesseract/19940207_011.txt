Charlotte's Creative Loafing
names Brad Griffin '93

~ “Newcomer of the Year."

By Scott McLean

How many times have you
consulted Creative Loafing (that
almighty reservoir of what’s hot in
local entertainment) after sitting
around for lengthy periods of time
with nothing to do? Given the
workload here at Davidson, this
probably hasn’t happened as often
as you’d like, but if you checked

make it personal while simulta-
neously taking the personal and
making it universal as well.”
Kate Collie maintained in her
speech that her paintings have
helped some veterans cope with
their memories. Collie expressed
that one way to rehabilitate veter-
ans is to have them “describe what
they did to a higher good—instead
many of the veterans had trash
thrown upon them when they re-
turned to New York” and were
later ostracized. Furthermore, she
explained that some veterans, such
as Steve Piscitelli, used art therapy
in order to communicate to the
higher good. She pointed out that
Piscitelli makes sculptures “in or-
derto remove events from theself.”
In fact, Piscitelli later admitted to
Collie that her paintings have

helped erase memories.
The series, through its paintings
and texts, enables the viewer to
sympathize not only with Steve’s
condition but also with the thou-
sands of Americans who suffer
post-traumatic stress syndrome. A
member ofthe audience mentioned
that perhaps she should concen-
trate on conveying through the
medium of the canvas and ques-
tioned the necessity of accompa-
nying the paintings with texts.
Collie responded that the
paintings “do not require words —
they’re not attached by any type of
umbilical cord. The text merely
sheds light on the paintings.” Kate
Collie emphasized the importance
of the paintings over the text. Col-
lie believes that the viewers may
tend to distance themselves from

the text provided a documentary
style, making amore realistic story.

Steve Piscitelli's presence at
the talk made for a much more
emotional night. Steve appeared
as he has for many of her shows
and made himself available to talk
with students and staff at the re-
ception. During Collie’s lecture,
Piscitelli rose to answer questions
from the audience. Piscitelli de-
scribed how post-traumatic stress
syndrome had induced behavior in
his own life.

His fears during Vietnam of
rotting weapons and the need to
maintain the readiness of a soldier
continue to haunt him. To provide
psychological security, Piscitelli
must have a working weapon, a
loaded pack, and a clean uniform
at all times. His story opened eyes
to shocking realities of war.

This past year Brad Griffin, a 1993
graduate of Davidson, was named
"Best Newcomer of the Year" in
Creative Loafing's annual theater
awards.

Griffin has always been an
avid enthusiast of the stage, long
before he got his first break in the
tenth grade, playing Snoopy in his
high school production of You’rea
Good Man Charlie Brown. How-
ever, Griffin is better known for
his work while at Davidson which
has included playing the male lead
in Kiss Me Kate, portraying Pip in
last year’s production of Great

Expectations, and serving as both
director and music director of Jo-
seph and the Technicolor
Dreamcoat-his senior year. This
production received stellar reviews
throughout the Davidson commu-
nity, not to mention all of
Mecklenberg county as well.

After graduating, Griffin took
a job in the Development Office
where he now handles contribu-
tions made to Davidson, but that
doesn’t mean that he’s decided.to
give up acting.

Heiscurrently working on the
upcoming presentation of You’rea
Good Man Charlie Brown for the
college, but this time he’ll be di-
recting instead of playing Snoopy.

The play is scheduled to pre-
miere at Davidson on February 18,
so be sure to come out and support
this young talent and sce éxacuy
