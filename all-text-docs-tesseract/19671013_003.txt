albraith Articles Open

Year’s Stimulus Program

The year's first round of
Stimulus meetings used as
their topic three Atlantic
magazine articles by John
Kenneth Galbraith Monday
night. The articles were on
the relationship between
esthetics and efficiency in
modern societies.

“The meetings went really
well,” said Stimulus. Chair-
man Mike Bates, who heads
the YMCA committee respon-
sible for the program. He
praised the nine Group Lead-
ers, whose responsibility it is
to direct the activities of
their groups.

Each of the nine groups is

composed of five members of
the college faculty or admin-
istration and twelve students.
The groups meet in fraternity
houses to discuss literature.
tapes of speeches and musical

performances, films or other
matters of interest.

All of this year's upper
classmen were invited to ap
ply to participate in the pro
gram. At the beginning of the
year 108 applicants were
selected, including four Rich
ardson Scholars, and faculty
members were invited to take
part. All participants agreed
to attend every meeting and
do the required reading as
decided by the = individual
groups.

The three articles by Gal-
braith» were based on _ his
book The New Industrial
State. Bates said that the
conclusion of the book was
that ‘“‘we have to subordinate
technological values to esthe-
tic ones." He continued that
this conclusion meant the
substitution of beauty for ef.-

ficiency.

Of the Group Leaders Bates
said, ‘“‘These fellows are all
excellent for the job. Their
own initiative and dependa
bility will greatly affect the
activity of their groups."’ The
nine are Tom Hart, Paul
Schneider, John Warren,
George Purvis, Bobby Lane,
Frank Fleming, Pete Gaskell,
George Shaw and Bill Schmic
kle.

Dr. Louise Nelson of the
Davidson Economics Depart-
ment is serving as advisor to
the program. “‘She has con-
tributed tremendously to the
program,"' said Bates.

“The fraternities are sup-
porting the program in a
very important way,” Bates
continued. “‘They have al-
lowed us to hold many of
this year's meetings in their

“IT expected to find a mass
of beards and sandals. but I
found a rather diverse group
of people,"’ commented junior
John Pancake.

Pancake was referring to
the Durham Peace Rally,
sponsored by the Southern
Student Organizing Commit
tee (SSOC) Oct. 6 and 7.
Davidson was represented by
Geoff Seamans, president of
the Davidson SSOC chapter.
Pancake, seniors Bill Bar
nett, J. P. Shrader, and Jack
Woodall, and juniors, Jim
Curtis and Bill Hearn.

The rally was basically a
workshop, offering classes on
canvassing, draft counseling
and organization of vigils to

Vietnam,”’ said Seamans.
“For instance, I went on a
half-hour practice canvass,
and out of the five people we
contacted, three had pretty
eloquent reasons for opposing
the war. The other two would
not see us,” he continued.

“These were working class
people. However, with the
given electoral: process in the
United States, I'm skeptical!
of what can be done besides
electing a Hawk Republican,”
Seamans said.

“While what we are doing
might not have too much of
an effect on the present war,
I do believe it is important,”’
said Pancake.
