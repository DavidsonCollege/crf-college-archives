Side Line Shots
At the Wildcats on the Court
and Mat
By P. R. Alderman

Judging from that game last Saturday
night, it’s pretty obvious that the Wild-
cats are to be reckoned with before the
champion of the “Big Five” is determined.

There’s no victory quite so sweet as one

over our ancient foes, the Carolina Tar
Heels.

Here’s hoping that that bad foot of Carl
Pritchett’s is OK before very long. He’s
there in every game!

The Furman game is the only one in
the loss column of the Wildcats’ contests
so far. That’s not at all bad for this early
in the season.

peed One of the chief problems that David-
son foes must consider the rest of the
year is in the form of Bill Goodson. When
it comes to guarding he’s more trouble

than a hornet’s nest. he

With a two weeks’ rest, barring some
practice, for both the fresh and varsity
quintets during exams, they should be
ready to wax hot as more and stronger
foes are met.

The Kitten quintet seemed to have
found themselves in the second game with
Charlotte Hi. Their teamwork was far
from perfect in the initial clash.

Pritchett is again leading his teammates
in points scored. He and Captain John-
ston shuold have a pretty close race for
the title of high-scorer for this season.

Rogers, diminutive forward on the
fresh quintet is leading the scoring for
the Kittens with “Skinny” Pierce running
a close second,

Unless fate is extremely cruel;)-“Red”
Laird should have one of the best frosh
cage teams seen here in quite a few sea-
sons. As soon as they get to working to-
gether a little better they’re going to be
hard to stop.

Everything semes to be starting out
right this year—Coach “Tex” Tilson’s
matmen exhibited mid-season form to
overwhelm the strong men from Concord
last Friday.

It’s going to be up to the wrestlers to
revenge our loss to the West Point grid-
ders last fall—that’s going to be a tough
match but Wildcats are Wildcats on the
mat as well as on the grid.

The guarding of Wagner and the floor-
work of Peabody have been the outstand-
ing feats of the Kittens so far this year.
Pierce, Manson and Rogers have also
shown up well.

‘In spite of the onesided defeat of the
Concord “Y” wrestlers last week, the fight
and grit that their heavy-weight entry ex-
hibited against Captain Christenbury of
the Wildcats demanded the admiration of
all.

It was time for the roll call at the
Polish Institute. The professor sneezed
six students jumped to their feet and
cried, “Present.”

When I was a small boy, I was left an
orphan.

That girl is a mathematical impossibility.

Howzat?

She’s. half Spanish, half French and half
crazy.

Monty: ‘That careless iceman, I’m glad
he’s losing out all along his route.”
Friend: “No, it’s the new butcher boy.”
