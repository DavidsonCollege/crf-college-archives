Old Chambers’ Ghost

You'd never get a God-fearing
Presbyterian to admit it, of course,
but there is a story, whispered when
told at all, that old Maxwell Chambers
wasn't opposed to taking’a drink every
now and then.

Chambers, of course, is the man
who gave the college a cool quarter of
a million back in the 1850's. Those
were lean years for Davidson, and the
Mecklenburg Presbyterians weren't
about to trouble their consciences over
Chambers’ little sins. The devil had
had the money long enough, they rea-
soned sweetly; now it was time for the
Lord to have it.

Not surprisingly, Chambers’ money
made Davidson the richest college
south of Princeton, and his generosity
was rewarded by naming the main
campus building after him. Even when
that building, affectionately dubbed
Old Chambers, burned to the ground
in 1921, the college was so apprecia-

tive it promptly built another one in
its place.

Well, old Mr. Chambers is long de-
parted and presumed with Saint Peter
now, but according to’ local folklore,
he still comes back occasionally to
check up on us. Whenever the rains
subside and the grass in front of the
present Chambers Building dies, you
can see where the majestic columns
of Old Chambers were anchored. That,
the story says, is evidence of the ghost
of Maxwell Chambers returned.

Now we're not about to endorse a
ghost story, of course, but next time
you're in front of Chambers, take a
gander at the front lawn. So dry is it
that not only are the old column holes
visible, but also the outline of the en-
tire building.

Old Max's ghost is back for sure.
Could it be that he thinks the campus
has been dry leng enough?

Wanted: Helping Hands

Twenty boys need your help.

Boys, ages 11-15, all members of
Boy Scout Troop 75, which received
its charter this week at a ceremony
at Davidson United Methodist Church.

So if you have some special scout-
type skills, or even only a willingness
to help out....

Specifically, students can help by
acting as leaders on weekend hikes.
Scoutmaster James Raeford, who
works during part of the weekend,

says he can’t take off from work.

And assistant scoutmaster Lyn Mon-
tague, Davidson senior, says that stu-
dents who have special scouting skills
can help out as counselors by giving
a demonstration.

The troop meets weekly on Tuesday
nights at 6:30 at the Community Cen-
ter on Griffith Street.

Now that the troop is on a firmer
footing, it needs: some more helping
hands. Yours, maybe?

The Library, Again

Where to put the new library? For -

nearly two years now that’s been a
burning question, and the trustees
are still looking for an answer.

They have sought the opinion of
just about everybody—their own
Buildings and Grounds Committee,
the Library Planning Committee, fac-
ulty members, and an assortment of
architects and so-called experts. But
one group they seem to have over-
looked is the group having the biggest
stake in the matter: the student body.

We are hot going to attempt to
speak for the student body as a whole,
of course, but we would call to the
board’s attention some oft-ignored
statistics.

In a poll of the student body two
springs ago, over 80 percent of the
some 600 students returning ques-
tionnaires—507 to be exact—favored
a site across Concord Road. Only 47
voted for a Lingle Manor site—where
the trustee committee wants it—and
even fewer would put it in front of
‘Little Dorm. which the planning com-
mittee reportedly favors.

The Concord Road site has a num-
ber of factors in its favor. It is only 30

Gruesome

Pat Taylor, who’s running for lieu-
tenant governor in North Carolina,
isn’t exactly what you’d call a typical
politician. In a crowd, he looks uneasy.
When he talks. it's in a soft, almost
apologetic manner. And when he
smiles. his face breaks into a big
sheepish grin. ;

But even if Pat Taylor is no typical
politician. he can see clear through
the men who are.

Last week, for example, he was
speaking to a group in Fayetteville,
and on the matter of “law and order,”
a trite campaign phrase if there ever
was one, and the politicians who ex-
ploit it, he said this: “I've never raised
this issue in this campaign because
I've never met a person who opposes

it. e

“Everyone agrees we should have
law and order. But some would have
you believe that they will work some
kind of miracle and everyone will obey
the law, or that they would overturn
the Supreme Court and the Constitu-
tion and the President and everybody
else and the leave the enforcement of
law and the administration of justice
to some kind of supreme police force,

steps beyond the present library. It
would round off nicely a quadrangle
with Chambers, Martin. Science Build-
ing and the present library. It
wouldn't clutter up the campus. And
its behind—which is bound to be ugly
—wouldn't be bared for public view.

The argument most often offered
against the site—the danger involved
in crossing Concord to get to the build-
ing—simply won't wash. Virtually
everyone on camptis manages to get
safely across State 115 at least once a
day to get to the post office, and 115
has a lot more traffic than Concord
Road.

As far as we're concerned, in fact,
only one argument carries any weight
against the Concord site—and that is
the possibility of a coordinate girls’
campus to the north sometime in the
future. . ,

If the college’s future-planners are
serious about a girls’ campus and
therefore want to place the library so
that it would be in between the two
campuses, we hereby retract all our
arguments. Get us some girls, and we'd
be willing to have the library in Mt.
Mourne.

Twosome

when in the first place they couldn't
do it and in the second place, they
really wouldn’t do it if they could.”

The newspaper account didn't say,
but it’s likely that Taylor was thinking
of. candidates ‘like George Wallace,
Spiro T. Agnew (who?) and North
Carolina’s own Jim Gardner. To that
list of “fear preachers’—men who
worship the police, right or wrong, or
have implied they would have looters
shot, or both-—we would add the name
of Taylor’s Democratic running-mate,
Bob Scott.

From Scott and Gardner in particu-
lar we are tired of hearing about law
and order. They’ve been harping on
it for months now, to the delight of
Tar Heel right-wingers and to the neg-
lect of the real issues.

What Taylor said in addition applies
equally well to both: “There are those
who take the serious issues which con-
front us and turn them into superfical
issues, with which they appeal not to
your reason, your common sense, but
to your anger and reaction.”

What a pitiful pair of typical politi-
cians we have to choose between this
November.

LETTERS TO _ THE EDITOR

Whitfield Urges Rationality;
Mixer Dates Are Unrewarding

To The Editor:

Another year is upon us,
and it would appear, once
again, that blind adherence
to holy tradition has safely
ensconched myriad follies
within a panoply of ridicu-
lously tolerant administrative
leniency.

The infamous Davidson
Gentlemen have been in resi-
dence only a week, and al-
ready Belk’s first floor dis-
gracefully bears the ravages
of the annual water riot.

The CRAP proposals which
some of our numbers have
worked so hard to officially

establish as the new essence
of the Davidson behavior
code, will require, if they
are to be effective, that we as
responsible students first of
all abolish the several follies
such as the annual water riot
and the orglastic train-bomb-
barding insobriety which has
annually typified the Thurs-
day before Spring Frolics
(Dave's Night); and second-
ly that we take upon our-
selves the responsibility of
initiating strong disciplinary
action against those of us
who would abuse the free-
doms granted us by the
CRAP proposals.

We must accept not only
the new liberties to be given
us, however, but must accept
also the responsibilities which
accompany new freedom,
and must give genuinely ser-
fous consideration to the
manner in which we will deal
with those among us who
would only exploit our new
freedoms.

Should we not do this, then
we deserve no better than the
antiquated, une n lightened
policies which have formed
the basis for student govern-
ment at Davidson in the past.

Though I do not claim to

many freshmen would agree
that the present system per-
taining to the weekend mixers
is badly in need of reap-
praisal and subsequent re-
vision in order for it to be
a success.

Though there are some
good matches made at these
mixers, this year’s episodes
have, in the opinion of this
writer, demonstrated the
comparative scarcity of such

Reid Unfair,

To The Editor:

“The dull distinguish only
races ofr nations,” said
Thoreau, ‘‘but the wise man,

When Thoreau wrote the
above, ‘he was about the same
age as Mr. Bob Reid.

Mr. Reid, however, is still
busily distinguishing races
and nations, and, in the Sept.
30 edition of The Charlotte
Observer, he made some
comments on the present
freshman class of Davidson
College.

views and his own keen in-
sight. Reid has handily classi-
fied the new freshmen as a

security blankets while hab-
pily pursuing selfish, personal
interests.

Last but not least, Reid
accuses the freshmen of be-
ing so callous as to be at Da-
vidson for the prime purpose
of studying.

Such accusations as Reid
has made are unfair and ir-
responsible. They rank on a
par with such pithy bits of
superficial reasoning as ‘“‘Ne-
groes are inferior to whites."

Specious reasoning often
makes good enough copy to

I have longed to make my

okay but they certainly come
in second best compared to
the advantages of a snack

items which machines can-

Also, the atmosphere creat-
ed by a snack bar is more
appealing to the student. The

“It ‘is trae that there have
been difficulties running the
snack bar in the past. but I
feel certain that the student
body would prefer an im-
provement of old methods
rather than a_ wholesale
switch to automation.

One worthwhile reform
might be to let the new snack

bar be _ student-operated.
There surely is no labor
shortage with so many stu-
dents needing jobs to keep
scholarships. ,

I sincerely hope something
is done to correct the present
situation. The opportunity to

ones

at Davidson for a little more -

than two weeks. Quite frank-
ly, this class cannot have any
judgments passed upon it one
way or the other.

Whether intended as a barb
against Davidson admission
policies, or any other under-
lying purpose, Reid's article
is indefensible and unfair to
the freshman class.

Davidson, I believe. is one
place where militant student
activity is unnecessary. But
if the faculty of Davidson Col-
lege were to-treat the fresh-
man class as summarily and
arbitrarily as did Mr. Reid
in his article, I am sure that
the freshman would make
their dissatisfaction known by
actions that. would be very
inconsistent with Mr. Reid's
evaluation of the Class of °72.

Fortunately, in the case of

the administration of David-

son College,. it appears that
with age comes some wisdom
and understanding of the in-
dividual. so there may be
hope yet for Bob Reid.

To The Editor:

The editorial page of last
week's DAVIDSONIAN fea-
tured a letter of concern from
Dr. Charles G. Hamilton over
the student body's response
to the CRAP Report. I can-
not help reacting negatively
to Hamilton's letter.

Hamilton drives home the
point that Davidson is a
“church college.” He implies
that such a status means that
the college should decide for
its students what is right and
wrong. and should ‘hold
their hands” for four years.
compelling these students to
act accordingly.

He also claims that the use
of alcohol makes men “less
human.” But is he not for-
getting that to impose a four-
year period of unreality upon
the students would be to
make them less human?!

Hamilton exploits the fact
that students here take Bible
courses and should know bet-
ter than to partake of alcoho-
lic beverages. Well, I happen
to be majoring In Bible, but I

cannot agree with Hamilton.

Although I do not «person-
ally advocate the use of alco-
hol, nevertheless I realize
that drinking is a part of the
real world. Perhaps Hamil-
ton’s Mississippi is a little
less real than Davidson Col-
lege, but if so, perhaps he
too is ‘less human."

I feel that a Nberal arts
college should teach its stu-
dents about life in the real
world, Any type of imposed
reality. is detrimental to the
students who will later be a

part of the real world.

Hamilton warns of falling
“into the hands of the living
God." I would frankly be
more concerned about God's
wrath if I were causing stu-
dents to live in an atmos-
phere that was anything short
of realistic.

It is truly disturbing to me
that a member of my chosen
profession is so unrealistic in
his approach to this issue.

puter dates are unsatisfac-
tory, unrewarding, and spoil

-what could be a pleasant

evening.

There are several reasons :
why this is the case. First,
the questionnaire on which
the computer cards and
matches are based is un,
realistic when used with a
eomputer.

Second, the questionnaire
could be better planned to be
more indicative of specific
peculiarities or tastes. With
all the psychology and socio
logy majors and professors
on campus, surely it would
not be too arduous a task to
produce an insightful and
meaningful questionnaire.

Many persons familiar with
the nature of computers
would agree that the exist.
ing questionnaire is inade
quate with regard to its in-
tended use.

Third, the whole idea of
questionnaires is rather mis.
conceived. It can be safely
said that, with the exception
of Davidson honor and chival-
ry where nice persdnalities
and poor appearance are con.
cerned, most men are at-
tracted primarily by a pretty
face and tend to regard per-
sonality later. Since a ques-
tionnaire cannot accurately

‘be indicative of appearance.

it is outmoded and useless. _

As a solution to this prob- |
lem, may I suggest that we
do away with this futile
matchmaking and merely
arrange a meeting between
a classful of men and a class-
ful of women, en masse.

This arrangement would
enable students to establish
their own matches (which is
as it sould be), and many
unpleasant instances of hav-
ing been deserted or finding
that one’s computer date has
made other arrangements, as
well as the accompanying de-
spondency, could be mini-
mized.

In order for this to work
effectively, a problem which
is rampant under the present
system would have to be
eliminated altogether: the
problem of upperclassmen.
It would seem that a fresh-
man mixer should provide an
opportunity for freshmen to
get to know some women at
a time when they as yet have
no contaets in their new situa-
tion.

The upperclassmen have
been around longer and have
had. or will get, their chance:
they are older and probably
more experienced in the art
of capturing women; many
have cars and _ -fraternity
houses and contacts in wom-
en's colleges which facilitate
their dating.

Where Is The Prophet?

+O Oe 7: 5,

“Hey, Jude, don’t make it bad. Take a
sad song and make it better,’ urges The
Beatles’ latest hit.

The'Letter of Jude in the New Testament
warns the first century congregation to
whom it is addressed that false teachers
have made their way into the church and
must be rejected in favor of the truth of
God if the people are to be saved.

The destination of the letter remains a
mystery and the name Jude, that of Jesus’
brother, may be only a pseudonym: But
Jude, whoever he was, warned the people
against the false prophets of the age.

Today’s congregation of the American
people appears to be searching for its own
Jude. Indeed many have presented them-
selves and many have won large segments
of the congregation over to them.

But overall the group is split—no man or
idea or symbol has won recognition as “the
Word" for the burgeoning, bustling Ameri-
can congregation, despite that congrega-
tion’s deep yearning for the Jude-like dox-
ology of peace and happiness.

“We have found material wealth, and
government programs, far beyond our
dreams of a few years ago, yet perhaps we
count the wrong things—for the new wealth
and activity seem to destroy as many
pleasures as they bring us... “ wrote one
young, hopeful Jude in his search for “a

. newer world.”

But that young Jude figure, presidential
aspirant Robert F. Kennedy. was struck
down before the congregation heatd out his
full prophecy. They could only perch hesi-
tantly, blank and silent, while another long,
black train passed into the darkness.

Davidson students showed strong support
for presidential hopeful Eugene McCarthy
last spring. along with thousands of other
college students across the countty who saw

They lost.

Will they go back to the streets?

Some have said no: “What you saw this
year was the dying gasp of a bunch of
bosses. hacks and bums. Four years from.

now we'll be running that party,” asserted

one youthful McCarthy asssitant following
the rejection of the Vietnam “peace plank”
and the defeat of Senator McCarthy for the
presidential nomination at the Democratic
convention.

Others feel the political spectrum is not

wide enough for them. And while the old ‘

men bemoan “‘the Communist influence”
they miss the significance of, or refuse to
recognize, an indigenous anarchist move
ment bred in America by Americans.

Non-electoral institutions would foster
“creative disorder,” according to these
spokesmen of a new American politics of
non-politics. “Grassroots” gtoups would
control the nation’s political and social life.

The System” has failed, they say: almost
anything—even nothing—would be better in
its place. .

In the meantime Al America and his wife
sit before the tube waiting for the election.
just waiting. It appears that nothing can
happen, nothing can change, until a new
man ascends the national mass media
throne.

They are frustrated yet mesmerized by
the months that the United States must
continue to ‘‘strengthen its position” in
Vietnam with more American blood while
the bickering political game plays itself
out in pettiness and promises.
