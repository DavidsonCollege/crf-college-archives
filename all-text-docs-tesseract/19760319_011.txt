With the approach of spring
and warmer weather, David-
son club sports have begun
their seasons in football,
soccer and lacrosse.

Club football began their

season in novel fashion when
they confronted the Charlotte

Police last Sunday. The game
was billed as a contest be-
tween the ‘‘freaks and the
fuzz’’, and the. Davidson
freaks were easily able to
avoid the long arm of the law
as they rolled to a 14-0
victory.

Charlotte’s police helped the
Davidson cause considerably
with two fumbles and three
interceptions stolen by David-
son’s defenders. The police
also fell victim to further
thievery as the Wildcats put
the game away with a halfback
option pass to Bob Bishop
that left the detective squad
stumped.

The win was club football’s
fourth in a row counting the
last three games of the fall
season. Junior Tim Sellers
credited the victory to im-
proved line play.

“Tt’s hard to put your finger
on any one standout. The
running backs and defensive
backs did a fine job but in the
end it was the offensive line
that made it all go.”’

Thirty-one players showed
up for the game in one of club
football’s highest turnouts
ever.

‘*We got a lot more fresh-
men and even a couple of
seniors who will only be able to
play with us this spring,’’
explained Sellers.

Davidson will put its vic-

tory streak on the line in its
next game against a strong
Central Piedmont club. How-

ever, Sellers feels that David-

son may be able to surprise
CiPe

“Our record will be strongly
challenged but I feel that for
the first time we have the
potential to beat them.’’

Club soccer has already
started its season and present-
ly has a 1-2 record with two

one-goal losses to Charlotte -

and High Point. Their only
victory came on a forfeit from
Pfieffer.

“We've looked all right. In
team play we look better then
we did during the fall season,
but the skills aren’t at such-a
high level,’’ explained Coach
Chip Stone.

Club soccer has several
players from the Davidson
soccer team but Stone noted
that the program is open to all
Davidson students.

‘‘Anybody who wants to
play can. Right now it’s
mostly team members and
we're also trying to incorpo-
rate the soccer class into the
program.”’

Davidson is in the North
Carolina League that includes
36 other clubs. The Wildcats
will play a nine game schedule
in the Southwest Division and
then finish the season in the
state tournament.

Stone feels that the club
program is beneficial to the
regular season program in
several ways. |

‘It allows the players to
work on skills where in the fall
all concentration is directed

towards winning. It also helps
us in recruiting because When
a kid looks at us he sees that
he will be playing all year
round.”’

Club lacrosse under Coach
Martin is preparing to start its
second season with a greatly
expanded program.

This year’s schedule will
include at least five games and
several more people _ are
playing this year.

“Last year we had only one
game and I had to play
because we didn’t have enough
players otherwise. We were in
trouble when I got thrown out
of the game,’’ explained

Martin.

If enough interest can be
generated the Athletic Depart-
ment hopes to eventually
create a varsity lacrosse team.
For now however, the club is
allocated no funds by the
department.

“There is absolutely no

money available for club la-
crosse and our players will
have to transport themselves
and pay their own way,” said
Martin.
\ Martin is pleased with the
growth of the club and feels
Davidson can support a good
lacrosse program.

“In members we’ve grown
and the skill level is way up. I

don’t even have to play any
more.”

“The important thing this
season is to take another step
towards arousing interest. I
think Davidson is a good place
for lacrosse but they will have
to put a little more into the
program.”’

The team will open against
Georgia and then play VMI,
the Citadel, Guilford twice and
possibly Clemson and South
Car@lina. The ohly home game
will be against Guilford on
Spring Frolics weekend.

Gargoyles defeat ruggers,
player suffers head injuries

Penalties overwhelmed the
Davidson ruggers against the
Gargoyles from Charlotte in
what was otherwise a closely
played game.

Behind outstanding -scrum
play of Jeff Morrow, Paul
Henschen, and Bucky Banks,
Davidson played much of the
game in Gargoyle territory.
But more often than not,
crucial penalties kept the Cat
ruggers from converting theiz
excellent field position into
scores.

Davidson scored first in the
match when Eric Hendricks
recovered a loose ball in the

end zone. Morrow put the Cats
up by six with a point after
touch conversion.

The Gargoyles fought back
to tie the score at 6-6 and then
went ahead to stay on two
penalty kicks.

Comeback efforts by the

Cats were dampened by. the
loss of Joe O’Connor who
sustained broken facial bones.
This left the Cats playing one
man short for most of the
second half.

Next week’s game is here
against Charlotte RFC.
