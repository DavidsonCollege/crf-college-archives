JUNIORS IN CHARGE

Outdoor Services Draw Large
Crowd Sunday Evening

Don Brandon and Bob Smith were
speakers, at the “ Mother's Day” Y. M.
C, A. vesper services last Sunday after-
noon, The services were under the di-
rection of the Junior class, and Kk, D.
Weeks was in charge. They were held
outdoors on the campus near Phi Hall.

After a piano prelude by Douglas
Wauchope and a hymn, Warner Du-
Bose and Walter Sprunt led the meet-
ing in prayer.

jrandon, the first speaker, took as
his subject, “What Mothers Mean to
Us.” He said that God blesses us with
many blessings, friendships, sunsets,
and all the wonders of nature. These
blessings are manifold. But for each
of us there is only one supreme bless-
ing, our mother.

Many of the world’s greatest men
have given all credit for their success
to their mothers. This is true for each
of us. It is she who has stood behind
us and made us what we are.

“What | really think our mothers
mean to us,” said Brandon, “is this:
a complete, absolute, self-sacrificing
love, which lasts*from before our birth
until long after our death, expressed
every day in little things.

“No matter how the world may re-
act to a man, however much of an out-
cast he may be, he is still his mother’s
son, Mothers are a perfect solace and
encouragement. There may be sueh a
thing as a man without a country, but
there is no-such thing as a man with-
cut a mother.”

Following Brandon's talk, Dave Me-
Lain sang Kreisler’s—*Old
accompanied by. Wauchope.

Smith spoke on the subject, “ What
We Should Mean to Our Mothers.”
The question has often been raised
whether children should honor parents
who are not worthy, because of the
lives they lead. Smith's answer is yes.
Our love us when we do
wrong, and the obligation holds both
ways.

Our mother’s love is a trust wit}
which we start into life. It is a tre-
mendous debt. How can we even be-
gin to pay it?

Certainly it cannot be repaid merely
by material support. It must be paid
in the terms in which it was given,
devotion and self-sacrifice. This does
not mean sentimental outbursts It
means letting our mothers know, even
though we may be widely separated,
that we remember her with love and
gratitude. It is the tribute of our
hearts that will help to repay them,

However, this does not altogether
pay up the bill. We are in a way an
expression of our mothers’ personali-
ties. They have molded us as they
wanted us to be, they worked their
ideals into us. And the world will
judge them by us. In order to fully
repay our mothers we must liye as. they
want us to.

Refrain,

mothers

“Dover Road’’Soon

Local Dramatic Club Presents
Milne’s: Play Monday

A play, “The Dover Road,” will be
presented at Chambers Auditorium
Monday evening, May 21, at 8 o'clock,
by the Red and Black Masquers. The
play, the last of a series presented by
the student dramatic club, was written
by A, A. Milne, author of “Mr, Pim
Passes By” and “Winnie the Pooh.”

Miss Adele Arbu¢kle and Miss Ka-
lista Hood will take the prominent
feminine roles, both having appeared
in previous Red and Black Masquers’
productions. Nathan Wauda,. whose
imitation of the cockney dialect in the
play “Candida,” by George Bernard
Shaw, received so much applause a
iew weeks ago, takes a leading role
as Latimer, the innkeeper who harbors
the runaway lovers, Stuart Henry and
W. H. Higgins will take the other
leading masculine parts, playing oppo-
site Misses Arbuckle and Hood,

The plot of the play, a comedy, is
summatized: A runaway couple, some-
body else’s husband (Leonard, played
by Stuart Henry), and somebody else’s
wife (Anne, played by Adele Arbuckle),
find it necessary to stop at a so-called
hotel owned by Mr. Latimer (Nate
Wauda) on the road to Dover. Dur-
ing the course of the evening, Latimer
acquires an attraction for Anne and
emphatically belittles Leonard. After
the meal is over he explains to both
of them whyche has forced them to
stop at his house.

Leonard's wife (Eustasia, hy Kalista
Hood) and Anne’s husband (W. H.
Higgins) who also play the runaway
couple, are about to leave, and have
endured the romantic control by Lat-
imer for the past week. Leonard ap-
pears for breakfast with a very bad
cold and relates to Latimer a number
of very humorous grievances against
the hotel—his suit is dropped in tle
bathtub, his luggage is lost and his
razor is gone,

At this moment Anne’s husband ap-
pears—and what happens next will be
disclosed most dramatically at the per-
formance,

Other student actors in the play are
Dick Hillier, Miss Mary Louise Mof-
fett, J. D. Allen and Horace Small-
The play is being directed
by Prof. E, J. Erwin and Wills Hol-
hngsworth, president of the Masquers,

New French Cinema
Is Seen At Theatre

Cercle Francais Sponsors
“A Nous, Le Liberte”

Le

A French production, “A Nous, La
Liberte,” was shown at the Davidson
Theatre at 1 o'clock this afternoon.
the picture, “ ‘A Nous, La Liberte’ is a
cle Francais, which invited the student
body to attend, a knowledge of thé
French language not being necessary
for the understanding of the show.

The picture was essentially comic, al-
though it contained satire and romance,
Reviewers have welcomed it as a step
forward toward international pictures.
The “New York American” says of
the picture, “ ‘ ANous, La Liberte’ is a
clever stinging satire, capably directed,
well staged and competently acted.
Knowledge of the French language is
not essential to an adequate under-
standing of the picture.”

It is pointed out that in “A Nous,
La Liberte” there are only 1,500 words
of French dialogue while in the aver-
age talking picture there are about
250,000 spoken words. The “New
York Herald Tribune” says: “A pic-
ture not to be missed, no -matter what
your demands of the screen may be.
It is an enormously exciting and com-
pelling work of art.”

The story of the picture is that of
two convicts, Emille and Louis, who
decide to escape from prison, Louis
succeeds but the other is captured and
returns to prison. Louis becomes presi-
dent of a large phonograph company,
ruling his workers with an iron hand.
Emille, at the/end of his term, wanders
about Paris and follows a pretty fac-
tory worker into the factory to make
her acquaintance. He is set to work
and, being inexperienced, is brought
before the president, his old friend
Louis. Louis promises to aid his pal
in his love affair but the girl says
“No.” In the meantime Louis learns
that the police have discovered the
skeleton in his closet and prepares to
take French leave, taking a suit case
of money with him, He loses it, and
accompanied by Emille, takes to the

Dr: Brown Writes On
Trends In Education

Article Is Featured by the Amer-
ican Review

Dr. C. K,. Brown wrote one of the
feature articles for the May issue of
“The American Review.”

In his article, “ Education in Machine
Utopia,” he discusses the statement
made by Mr.—Walter B. Pitkin, who
says that a Utopia is in sight. “ Edu-
cation will be geared more accurately
to the demands of real life; everybody
will be trained to handle five or six
jobs well and to use leisure advan-
tageously and pleasantly.”

Pitkin’s prophecy had as its basis
the assumption that the machine
method would shorten working hours,
Thus, a man should be enabled to
work more jobs and have much more
leisure than ever before. So educéa-
tion must play the role in fitting man
to attain the most from his leisure.

Dr. Brown stated thas this predic-

tion for education has been the ideal
for years; but the success of prepar-
ing men to make a living and to live
abundantly has become more and more
meagre.
_ He points out the way machinery is
affecting men now. “If we are look-
ing for real life, we might be able to
observe that the machine method of
production has rendered the business
of making a living utterly distasteful,
and that our distaste-for it is respon-
sible for our attempt to reduce the
world’s .work to the status of a mere
mean$ existing for the furtherance of
some end held to be desirable.” He
states that the danger of this attempt
would destroy the unity of life.

He shows that life would refuse to
Le departmentalized to such an attempt
that work would be routine, “The life
that exists beyond the bounds of the
world’s serious work must be of a
piece with that which characterizes
men as they go about for their daily
bread.”

He furthers this view by saying that
Mr. Pitkiu’s future economic system
would crush the personality of man.
Men could not be enterprising—their
leisure taken up by art, music, litera-
ture, religious expression could not
subordinate the real business of life, —

Dr. Brown says that education can’t
make man in general capable of sus-
taining a high order of human expres-
sion, but only few can attain or could
attain a desire for the full appreciation
of art or contribute to art, Education
cannot undertake to dismember life’s
organic whole—the work for sus-
tenance and for enterprise and profit.

“If machine civilization is barren
and ignoble during the hours when it
exacts hum vitude, it must inev-
itably be so in the hours that remain,”
he stated. He furthers this conclusion
by saying that it is a conclusion from
which we shrink; and, having no other
power to call on, we promise ourselves
a soul-satisfying leisure which educa-
tion must make into a full life,

He sums the whole theme up by
stating that education should not be
sent on a vain search for a way to
escape from the machine method. It
should hunt. for a new principle upon
which a unified life could be achieved.
“Education has no right to its name
unless it follows its true pole-star—the
oneness of life.’ U

Dr. Lyon Gives Lecture
To Photography Group

The Amateur Photographers Group
held its fourth regular meeting Tues-
day, the 15th, in Dr. Lyon’s classroom.
Dr. Lyon, head of the Biology Depart-
ment, gave a brief lecture and a gen-
eral discussion and criticism of pic-
tures taken by club members followed.

Dr. Lyon’s lecture, “The Making and
Development of Pictures,” is one of a
series he plans to give in connection
with taking and developing pictures.
In his talk, he divided the developing
of pictures into seven distinct steps
and explained the chemicals and work
required in each,

A dark room has been set up in
Shearer Hall with running water and
the necessary lighting system for con-
struction of pictures. Pans and tubes
have been purchased and other essen-
tial equipment for development of pic-
tures is being bought by Dr. Lyon.

Several members of the Amateur
Photographers Group exhibited pic-
tures which were criticized by Dr.
Lyon and club members. Students in
the photographic club are encouraged
to bring pictures they have taken so
that their faults may be pointed out.

Davidson students, who own cameras
and take an active interest in taking
and developing pictures, are eligible
for membership. Many students have
taken advantage of this opportunity to
learn how to make and develop their
own pictures,

The organization plans to get special
rates on films for its members,
