“Has the Davidsonian gone broke? —_—_ Subseri e °
We have not seen a copy since before] Last week Davidson was visited by 3 ‘

Christmas, and we miss it very much.” | the landscape architect, Mr. Nolan, ot 3

—Robt. L. McKinnon ('14).
“Have just read in

to Davidsonian.”—Capt. M. H.

Brvde, Alumnus 1859.

“The first issue of ‘The Davidsonian
for this year came yesterday, much to my

delight. “To 'say the least, | devoured
every word of it and found the whole
most. delectable, indeed. Though =!
finally decide to cast my lot with the
Germans and join the Kaiser's forces,
simply must have “The Davidsonian to
peruse every week.”—"Dr.” Guthrie
(14).
“Am enclosing $1.00 for ‘The David-
sonian, which is about the most welcome
sheet that comes to the desk. It gives
me the: best substitute for the actual
campus fife among the fellows—the real
happiness of every week. Keep it up.’
TT. C. Bales.
“Tam quite sure that [Poam_ voicing
the sentiments of all the alumni when J
say that The Davidsonion is one of the
best things ever started at Davidson Col-

securing a closer unian of the alumni
with the college.”—Clifford F. Herrick

BASKET BALL. (FEAM
MAKES GOOD SHOWING

The basket ball team returned last
Kriday .from a trip to Statesville, Salis-
bury-and Greensboro, where they played
the respective Y. ML. C. A. teams. “The
team left the Hill) last ‘Tuesday — for
Statesville and engaged the Y. M. C. A.
of that town that night. Davidpon
clearly outclassed their opponents and
the game ended 39 to 21 in Davidson's
favor. .

On Wednesday morning the team
went to Salisbury from Statesville. In
the game that night they were defeated,
but the game was so hotly contested that
it was doubtful as tu how the results

would terminate, but it may truly be]

said that a streak of luck broke against
Davidson, and the game ended 39 to 38
in favor of Salisbury.

The last game was played in Greens-
boro on Thursday night. “Che team was
rather weary that night, having played|‘
the two nights previous, and they were
again defeated, but not until they had
proved that they were worthy oppon-
ents. “Ihe score was 39 to 16. The
team was guided by Manager Al Reese
in the absence of Captain Tom Somer-

ville. The following men went on the
trip: Al Reese, manager, Hengerveld,
Howell, Laird, Walker, R. B.. Austin.

Childs, Moore, Carson, and Wood.

ELECTION OF BASIE:
BALL CAPTAIN

Leslie Alford, of Chipley, Fla.. was
recently elected captain of the base ball
team for this spring. Captain Alford
was first catcher on Varsity year before
last and a good steady man to have be-
hind the plate. He did not return to
Davidson after Christmas last year, and
his absence was keenly felt by the Var-
sity last spring. This year Davidson is
expecting to put out a winning team.
and with Bill Fetzer coaching and Al-

ford field captain, the chances seem

bright indeed.

SPARROW ELECTED
MANAGER

At a meeting of the Athletic Associa-
tion held immediately preceding the
Christmas holidays. ‘Tr. D. Sparrow was
elected manager of the foot ball team
for the season of 1915. He succeeds
Lex W{ Kluttz, who for the past two
years has so admirably and successfully
managed the affairs of the “Red and
Black Machine.” Mr. Sparrow for the
past season an assistant manager, as-
sumes the important and responsible
duties of this office well qualified to
make the team of 1915 an efficient man-
ager.

a tentative plan representing his ideas
for the improvement and further de-

to the faculty for their criticism. He

rather old. ‘The old buildings are weil
placed. Davidson has something that
very few colleges have, and that is a
golf course, and an attractive one it is,
too. Another thing that [ have never
seen anywhere else is an outdoor eym-
nasium, a distinctly Southern institution
for January use, but [ saw it in oper-
ation yesterday. In fact | saw students
engaged in foot ball, base ball, basket
ball, tennis, outdoor gymnasium, and
running, a striking combination of sports
for the middle of January, and one that
would not be possible north of here.”

Serious damage to the home of Dr. J.
W.. McConnell was averted on last
Thursday just after supper by prompt
action in: extinguishing a blaze on) the
roof. “Phe fire was discovered before it
had made anv headway, and climbing
to the roof with buckets of water, pass-
ers by and several of the students who
happened to be within call, aided in
quickly putting it out. Owing to the
quick work, little excitement was caused
and only a few shingles burned.
