\ Bor the anual:
pd week-end,
Coach Charley and.
his. charges are off to

Lexington, Va., this
time for a game with =

the Keydets of VMI. Sconeneseneenel
and for the second tinie
they will take the field
in the role of definite
underdogs. It could
have easily been the
other .way around, but
recent performances by
the Wildeats have
‘given writers and
‘dopesters little or no
reason to think they
can produce a win.’

ANOTHER HOMECOMING GAME

There is something that ean be said both ways concerning
tomorrow’s game. On the dark side of the picture, the David-
sons will be playing their fourth straight homecoming game this
season. Three have resulted in defeat for the loeal gridders, and
as mentioned above, they will be in for another licking at the
hands of VMI unless the dope-bucket is upset. The fact that it
is the Keydets’ homecoming is bad enough, but there’s the added
truth that they are always hard to lick on their home field.

On the other hand, Jamerson expects to have the squad in
the best shape, physically, sinee the State game. Eborn, Sharpe,
Chandler and Richards will be back in the line-up. The back-
field is still a question mark. Sifford suffered a. thigh injury
against W&L which has been giving him trouble this week, and
he may be slowed down considerably. Lambeth is not in top
shape due to a shoulder injury, and Rimer aggravated his old
shoulder injury against the Generals. Runyan’s batk injury
hasn’t responded to treatment as well as had been hoped for,
but it’s probable that he will make the trip: This brief ran-
down shows that the Cats are still nursing a number of ailments,
but it’s a far ery from the situation that existed last week when
W&L waltzed over them. _

SUBS SHOW PLENTY OF FIGHT

Last Saturday, with six starters out and others added to
the list as the game progressed—some new faces were seen in
the line-up. Some .of these had played briefly in éarlier games,
but for others it was their first varsity competition. We're
speaking of Marvin Kelly, “Slimey’’ Sloan, Bob Turk, Brady
Osborne, Bill VanStery, Amos Camp, Johnny Gnuiton, Bill
Freeman. All of these. subs performed like
veterans and exhibited the fight and spirit that has been lack-
ing during the last few weeks. Their serap and determination
were a real inspiration to the handful of Davidson supporters
who followed the team to Lexington and labelled them as sure
hets to see plenty more action before the current season. fades
out.

BY FURMAN WARLICK

During half-time of the Washing-
ton and» Lee Davidson football
game in Lexington, Virginia, the
Davidson Cross Country team
downed the General Harriers by a
decisive 20-24 score. This was the
only bright spot for Davidson stu-
dents and fans in Lexington for the
week end.

Hansburger of Washington .and
Lee came in first with the good time
of 16:26. Before another General
crossed the finish lime, five David-
son harriers had come in. and. as.
sured Davidson of a win, Speedy
Blake Bradley.was. the first Davyid-
son man to cross, coming in thirty-
one seconds after Hansburger in the
time of 16:57. ‘Tom Stockton, Dave

Long followed Bradley across the
line. ’

team helped in keeping the week

Wildcat Of The Week

BY JACK

From viewing the score of last
week's 53-0 drubbing by Washing-
ton & Lee, one would think that
there could have been little for Da-
vidson supporters to smile about.
But those who saw the game will
disagree. We ‘refer to the defen-
sive tackle play of Jim’ Fasul,

We aren't stretching things when
we say that FPasul was in on: bet-
ter than one of every. two
tackles, and on many of these it
was the stocky sophomore alone
who. nailed the W&L. ball carrier.
From. his tackle spot, which
virtually the same as an end in an
ordinary défense, Fasul broke up
the General's interference time af-
ter time to sét up tackles for the
line backer arid secondary.

With the absence of many of thé
string offensive men, Fasul
was called on for duty in clearing
the way for Cat ball carriers. He
showed up as well here as in his
defensive play.

The Freshman Football. team én-
countered the hard hitting N. C.
State Wolflets last Friday and fell
before the onslaught bya 33 to 0
margin, This score does not indi-
cate exactly what went on under
the lights in Fayetteville that night.

In the first half, nothing seemed
to go right for the Red and White.
Their passes were intercepted and
the kicks were blocked, State had
a smooth running passing attack
and used it to a great advantage.
This was the real factor that
brought about State’s triumph,
since the running game of both
teams was about equal. When the
half ended, the score was 26 to 0.

Davidson came back on the field
in the second half a different team
and held the Wolflets to one addi-
score. The playing in this
period showed a marked improve-
ment over the preceding one. The
final score of the game was 33 to 0.

iously the whole way and kept

Of Much Needed Regulars to Line-up

q

Another Homecoming, another T or variation thereof, and
another appearance in Lexington are the orders of the day for
Davidson’s still-crippled Cats when they buck VMI’s Keydets
in the Virginia village tomorrow afternoon. No doubt the Lex-
\ ington football faithful will trek back this week end to see the

Wildeats in action again, nor be-
cause they were offensively impres-
sive last week in the loss to Wash.
ington and L.ee but to see for them-
selves that certainly the Presbyter-
ians can play ‘better than 53-0 foot
ball.

Realizing that full well and as
confident as the spectator that the
Cats can perform better than they
did last Saturday, Coach Charley
Jamerson has reaped the sowings
of leaving several men at home last .
week end and hopes it ill pay off
this: time; ;

Back into: the fold are brilliant
soph fullback C. L. Runyan, : the
line-buster who ripped State's wall
at will, Auburn Lambeth's tailback
alternate Cliff Turner, guard Bud-
dy’ Chandler and possibly Bob
Sharpe, and. tackle Carl Eborn,
none of whom made the jaunt last
week end. _

Still) question marks, however,
are Lambeth and wingback Jimmy
Sifford, while Hal Mapes. is prob-
ably lost for the season with the

shattered bone in his cheek. Robby

Turk has gained experience fast
replacing Mapes, and he and Tom .
Comer are developing into a fine
pair of soph flarikers to work on

defense while Pete Brown and
Mott. Price handlé the offensive
duties.

With Sifford sidelines, Jake Wade
will see double duty at safety and
on the wing, working the latter
spot with lil” Dave Erwin. Turner
will get the brunt of the tailback

‘duty.

The Keydets of VMI trimmed
Richmond 14-7 and bowed to Ar-
my this past Saturday by only 40-14,
Their top tosser, and they throw
the ball. around: plenty, is Joe. Vel-
tri, a boy who will vie-~with Lam-
beth for the honors in the airways.

The Tom Nuggent-coached Key-
dets operate from the split-T, a
formation that has caused the Cats
no ent of treuble all season long
N. C. State used the T but little,
and the Cats” solved their single
wing. The long drive late in the

;game which was halted by Wade's

TD interception was matiufactured
behind the T. If the Cats can ‘solve

that, they may be able. to enjoy

their first Homecoming this year.

Thus far they have been beaten at
St. Louis’, their own, and Washing-
ton and Lee's.
