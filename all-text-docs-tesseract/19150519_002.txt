spoke on the “Fall and Rise of Simon
Peter,” Luke 22:31, 32, presenting fou
definite lessons of warning and encour-
agement. He showed first that Satan
may fead good people to commit a great
sin: second, that this is brought about
by almost imperceptible steps down.
ward; third. that no matter how far the
Christian falls, Christ is always ready to
bring him back: and lastly. that, after
being restored Christ is willing to use
the Christian mightily.

At the second cervice Dr. Caldwell
took ‘for his text Mark to:t7-22, and
snoke on the “Rich Young Roler”—
the only man who ever came to Christ
as an earnest oeker and then went away
dissatisfied = He nointed out the one
reqacon——refiucal en out Christ first in his

life—and drew a strong lesson for every
hearer.

De. Caldwell is an able and forceful
sneaker. and the whole student hady en-
joyed his brief visit.
