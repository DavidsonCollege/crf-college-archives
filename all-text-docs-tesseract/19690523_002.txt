About Those Waterfights

One member of the administration
is reported to have said recently con-
cerning freshman dormitories, “1 just
don’t understand why the waterfights
continue. They (the students) wouldn’t
do thu. in their homes.”

Obviously, students don’t do it in
their own homes.

But the reason is simple. The dor-
mitories look no more like homes
than the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion
resembles Calvin Coolidge.

In one freshman dorm:

—The windows haven't been wash-
ed since the start of the year. Thev
add a grey pallor to whatever is seen
through them.

—The halis are grey and yellow.
long and bare. From the ceiling three
bare lightbuibs glare down. The rem-
nant of light that does pass through
the hall windows is reflected only
weakly on the dirty linoleum. The ar-
rangement may be appropriate to a
prison or a monastery, but not an
institution of higher education.

—Stairwells stink (yes, stink) dur-
ing the winter. The bare concrete ab-
sorbs and holds the air’s moisture, and
one wonders as he descends stairs if
he is about to enter some medieval
dungeon around the next corner.

—Shower stalls have a thick yel-
low-brown film on the wall, covering
the white tile. It can’t be washed off,

but with a bit of effort, you can
scratch some away with 4 fingernail.

—Closet doors can’t be locked, but
the chicken-mesh wire above them
does an admirable job of keeping
out foxes. (There hasn't been one re-
ported in the dorm closets since it
was installed.)

—Finally, there is this item. Though
it is not particularly bothersome,
it is svmbolic. The curtains in the
freshman dorms have on them planta-
tion scenes, complete with slaves out
chopping cotton.

The catalog could continue. It’s
amazing no one has applied for urban
renewal yet (overlooking Davidson’s
lack of urbanity) or called a rent

‘strike.

This is the environment in which
Davidson students spend their first
year, an environment which is sup-
posedly furthering education. since
that reason is, after all, the ‘college’s
only justification for requiring resi-
dence in the dormitories.

If the college is trying to train the
nation’s future plantation owners,
prison wardens and monks, perhaps
the dormitories are appropriate.

Otherwise, the time is long overdue
for a thorough remodeling, and we
wish to remind the college of this
need as it embarks on a summer of
work in the residence halls.

Poverty-Level Pay

While students are hammering
aw: ' at “administration and faculty
hypocrisy,” it might be well for them
to stop a minute and examine them-
selves, particularly in the area of
fraternity cooks’ wages.

Over the course of a year, begin-
ning with two DAVIDCONIAN articles
last spring, it has become evident
that cooks are underpaid. The figures
aré tangled, and the situation varies
from house to house, but the unfor-
tunate truth is now known for cer-
tain.

Fraternity treasurers have in some
eases forgotten to fill out proper In-
ternal Revenue Service forms, or pay
IRS taxes. Some cooks receive no
sick pay, and many are off during
the summer without pay because
fraternities don’t pay unemployment
insurance.

But the central point is that the
wager themselves are too low. Love
and affection from a fraternity don’t
feed hungry children at the cook’s
homes, and the dance weekend hours
are not the best in the world.

To say it bluntly, wages are below
poverty level.

The Student Life Committee’s sug-
gestion that the college supervise
cooks’ pay and taxes was a good idea,
but it would be better if students
could keep the initiative. Perhaps it
would be possible for the IFC to set
minimum wages and other basic re-
quirements on payment of cooks. At
least if. they don’t, the student Sen-
ate certainly could. -

But no matter who does it, wages
need to be raised, and minimum
scales set for cooks’ pay.

Letter
Dispute
Goes On

To the Editor:

I find it annoying to be told
that if I do not share Mr.
Tucker's precise perspective
I have either failed to un-
derstand or listen to (pre-
sumably) the Truth (Letter,
May 16 DAVIDSONIAN).°

He missed my point and
sprang to the defense of a
cause I didn't attack.

Who said the black posi-
tion was nut unique? It js
unique to itself. but not with-
in the human framework.

Why tell me again that
white America has_histori-
cally abused its black seg-
ment? The point is that lL.
a white person. have not wil-
lingly. abused a black per-
son Wecause of his race.

I am not ‘white America,”’
past or present. I am me.
If not accepted as individual
me, then I am a, created
enemy: since ‘I am not of
myself inimical.

Did I say the Negro was
shadow-boxing at illusory
enemies only? No. I merely:
stated my view that the il-
lusion that there is a hostile
white animal is pointless and
dangerous.

Bitterness against an ab-
stract body (Whitey) blinds
to the individual (concerned
white human).

There is no empathy deep
enough to apprehend the, pain
an American Negro suffers
due to real human or insti-
tutional enemies.

The only bitterness worth
sharing is that of being alive
as we are, understanding so
little. Can we never eschew
mutual whining, circular
colors and accents and
guilts? We are ali each
other's enemies exactly as
we are our own.

I never denied the real
problem of racism.

Rather, 1 affirmed the real
problem of black men let-
ting bitterness cause to be
“constructed at infinite cost
to themselves Maginot Lines
against this enemy they
thought they saw across the
frontier, this enemy who
never attacked that way...
if he ever attacked at all;
if he was indeed the enemy.”
(John Knowles. ‘A Separate
Peace").

Alumnus Criticizes ROTC,
Calls For End To Program

To the Editor:

. With compulsory ROTC
now dropped to the wayside
at Davidson it would seem
appropriate to consider
whether the entire ROTC pro-
gram as it now exists on a
nationwide scale should be
completely revised and ov-

-erhauled.

This is not just a David-
son problem but also a
problem for the Depart-
ment of the Army and the
nation as a whole.

Recognizing both that the
ROTC program is the Army's
largest source of officers and
that there is a definite need
for the college-graduate-ju-
nior officers within the Arm-
ed Forces since there is a
greater tendency for these
to represent non-profession-
el viewpoints, I would sug-
gest the following program:
simply do away with ROTC
as it now stands, substitut-
ing an expanded summer
camp program (perhaps two
or more summers) and de-
manding as requirements for
the commission the receipt
of the undergraduate degree
and satisfactory performance
at summer camp.

There are several reasons
for this proposed change:

Latimer Praises Spirit Of Change

The following was submil-
fed as an open letter to Pres-
ide~s Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

“o the Editor:

After four years as a stu-
dent at Davidson, I feel a
tremendous attachment to
the college and have a real
interest and concern for its
future welfare and develop-
ment.

Accordingly, I should like
to share with you some ui
the reflections which have
crossed my mind during the
past few weeks in the nope
that these thoughts may
prove helpful to you.

The first thing that comes
to mind in these days prior
to commencement is appre-
ciation, and I wish to thank
those many members of the
faculty and administration
who have worked hard to
teach, and understand us in
and out of the classroom by
precept and example.

In this 1 think I speak for
the entire class.

Neverthelcss, the main pur-
pose of this letter is not to
award kudos, but rather to
point out by constructive cri-
ticisms areas in which David-
son is seriously deficient and
in need of substantial change
and improvement.

The first area, the social
sphere, is large and includes
many problems. 1 shall not
beat the old fraternity horse
again, for it is already an
overplayed issue.

A second problem is the
lack of female companion-
ship. Despite the recent and
apparent disinterest in co-
ed week, I think most stu-
dents sincerely favor some
form of co-education on our
campus, and I shall await
with interest the report of
your commission dealing

Open Letter Challenges Spencer

To

with this subject.

These issues, however, pale
into relative insignificance
when compared to the dormi-
tory situation. To begin with,
we are force to live in drab
boxes which are not con-
ducive to any sort of social
life and were designed with
all the imagination of a
stable.

The sterility of their archi-
tecture is appalling (except
for Duke, whose architect
must have had an overactive
imagiantion). For most peo-
ple a dorm is merely a dirty,
noisy. overcrowded, ill-equip-
ed slum where one sleeps.

Two toilets for twenty-
five persons; no recreation-
al lounges: no cooking facili-

ties: dark, slippery, worn
stairwells; lack of  tele-
phones; undependable heat-

ing: antiquated furniture:
uncomfortable beds: rats:
and inadequate lighting do
not present a very attrac-
tive picture to a prospective
Student (nor 4 pleasant e11-
vironment to the residents).

And the catalog could go
on. Putting a lounge on each
floor will not solve the pro-
blem—which should take pre-
cedence over. the construc-
tion of a new library.

A second area of consid-
eration concerns athletics. Al-
though I am not particurlar-
ly skilled in athletics, I en-
joy watching our basketball
games as much as the next
guy.

What is at issue is institut-
ing a real physical education

Continue Reform

program designed to allow
for full: participation for the
proficient athlete and for in-
struction to those of us who
are not so endowed.

In keeping with this need,
the football program should
be desubsidized and David-
son's whole philosophy of
subsidized athletics, as well
as participation in inter col-
legiate sports, should be re-
examined (as your commis-
sion is doing).

This is not a proposal that
all subsidizstion of athletics
be abolished. Rather, it is an
attempt to restore perspec-
tive and equilibrium to our
judgment.

It is the recognition that
the qualified athlete has no
moropoly on contributing to
the college.

The whole question of sub-
sidized athletics is, however,
only symtomatic of a far
vaster problem. It is the
tip of the iceberg labeled
“admissions policies.”

This is so because the se-
lection of students will de
termine invariably the coim-
plexion of the school.

For this reason the admis-
sions office must concentrate
more on choosing students
whose qualifications are in
consonance with the avow-
ed aims of Davidson as a
liberal arts college.

Furthermore, David.
son should move to a po-
licy which will base financial
ald on need.

Even more important than
restoring sanity to our ath.

letic policy is the need for
active recruitment of black
students and minority groups
of all types.

If Davidson wishes to re-

flect and to prepare the stu---

dent for the increasingly
complex and pluralistic so-
ciety of which he is a part, it
must make a concerted ef-
fort in this direction. How-
ever, we should not recruit
these people unless we
seriously want them and are
willing to make certain sacri-
fices so as to make their stay
at Davidson rewarding.

This is not to suggest that
we lower our academic
Standards. It is suggesting,
though, that we admit, for
example, blacks in sufficient
numbers so that the indivi-
dual black can’ cease being
a curiosity and start being
a student.

In the administra-
tive realm the professing
Christian rule of faculty ten-
ure policy should be abolish.
ed (but not only because of
the exigencies of the acadc-
mic marketplace but as an
attempt to eliminate hy-
pocrisy and provide for a
free and open exchange of
views among persins of dif-
fering beliefs).

Personal belief, I feel, is
strengthened by  confronta-
tion. After all, a man does
not have to be a Christian
to be kind. compassionate,
and sensitive.

The last area I wish to
examine really concerns a
question of values and prin-

ciples.

it is the moral aspect of
the college education. David-
son has abdicated, quite just-
ly I think, its role of in loco
parentis while ‘simultaneous-
ly attempting to upgrade the
academic program to true
excellence.

‘This is highly commend-
able and I do not see how
anyone could quibble with
this policy.

Yet it strikes me_ that
academics should not be the
only emphasis of a college
education. This was especial-
ly inyoressed on me earlier
this year when someone in
chapel mentioned the ‘‘Chris-
tian democratic ideals’’ that
Davidson supposedly fosters.

His statement was receiv-
ed with hoots,” sneers, and
gales of derisive laughter. I
thought -at that moment how
far away we seemed to have
drifted from certain very
basic ideals of th. college.

Perhaps what I really wish
is an atmosphere or atti-
tude in which social con-
sciousness and social re-
sponsibility are encouraged
and in which good men as
well as good students can
develop.

Davidson should educate its
men to humane instincts as
well as learning, to service
and compassion as well as
to finding their places in the
corporate infrastructuré of
a materialistic society.

In conclusion, I want to
thank you for keeping the
channels of communication
open between yourself and
the students, and for not
fearing new and innovative
approaches to the complex
problems which face David-
son.

GRADUATION PLANNING CENTER

my “WELL, IF ALL ELSE
FAILS, WE CAN HAVE 1T AT
THE NEW LIBRARY SITE.”

“e —

(1) There is no good rea-
son why academic credit
should be given for ROTC
courses or why military in-
instructors should have pro-
fessorial standing—even West
Point cadets do not receive
academic credit for hours
spent at drill, and most of
their military training is
done during the summer.

(2) The classroom hours,
at least at Davidson, are
pretty much a waste of time
which anyone who has been
to summer camp knows —
everything taught in four
years at Davidson in ROTC
could be learned in two sum-
mers at Ft. Benning or Ft.
Bragg, if the simmer camp
program were so designed.

(3) If academic credit is
seen as an inducement for
enrolling, it is submitted that
pay increases could have the
same effect.

Such changes in ROTC
would deny to no one the
opportunity of participating
in an: officer candidate pro-
gram, and in fact, if all the
branches of the Armed For-
ces were to make such im-
provements, the student at
Davidson, who is now limit-
‘ed to Army ROTC, would
nave the opportunity of
participating in Air Force or
Navy ROTC.

If the loss from the curri-
culum of such cources as
Military History is feared,
the College can very easily
offer a course in the Theory
of War.

If the ROTC program is
going to be an issue of con-
flict on campus between ad-
ministration and students, e.
g.. Harvard, why should ad-
ministrators hold ground on
a program which is not worth
keeping anyway?

A Note Of Thanks

To the Editor:

As this school year at
Davidson comes to an end,
the internatidnals want to
raise their voices for the
first and the last time in
this paper.

Looking back on almost
nine months of “studying”
we all think that we learn-
ed a lot, ie. how to get a
date provided by the com-
puter, where we can meet
Hattie, and where we can
find all these wise books we
had to study.

But, honestly, we really
got to know American peo-
ple and “the American way
of life."

Several “foreigners” tour-
ed the country and have seen
the real face of the United
States with her good and
not so good parts.

We truly thank Davidson
College for providing such
a great scholarship for in-
ternational students, and we
hope that Davidson will con-
tinue this program in order
to help international under-
standing in the small world
of today.

Especially we want to ex-
press our gratitude to our
Foreign Student Advisor Dr.
Max Polley and his secre-
tary Mrs. B. D. Thompson
for all their advice and help
during the school year.

cooks did talk about their

On Violence And The Man

Much of the violent heritage of the people of the

United States has been preserved and passed on to
us today in the forms of aggressive militarism and
capital punishment. We relive the birthpangs of the
nation and its growth in the slaying of our foes, both
the foreigners to whose homelands we journey to
prevent the spread of alien ideology, and local crimi-
nals, whom we execute as seeming.also un-American.

The urge to go off on freebooting military ven-
tures is born somewhere in the depths of the collec-
tive psyche seeking virility symbols. The compulsively
inadequate self which seeks proof of its adequacy is
tellingly protrayed in Norman Mailer’s surrealistic
“Why We Are In Vietnam.” Mailer might cal] it the
LBJ complex.

Capital punishment has its roots in a more dis-
tant pseudo-religious yen for vengeance, the feeling
that there are certain requirements of retribution
that must be maintained for the structure of society
and the security of the individual. But the death
penalty also thrives on the feeling of power of being
able to take a human life in a socially accepted way,
even with a veneer of righteousness.

There is also a strangely regional and ethnic
character to the application of the death penalty, as
erhaps there is to violence in America in general.
ut the history of the death penalty shows that its
application has been far from impartial.

Between 1930 and 1962, 3,812 persons were ex-
ecuted in America, according to the U. S. Bureau
of Prisons. Of these, 2,049 were Negroes.

Georgia led the nation in executions with 362.
North Carolina had 263, South Carolina 162, Virginia
92, Florida 167, Kentucky 103, Tennessee 93, Alabama
133, Mississippi 151, Louisiana 133, Arkansas 117,
and Texas 288. All of these states executed for more
Negroes than whites.

Most were executed for murder. However, in the
whole United States 45 whites and 399 Negroes were
killed for rape. Of these, 42 whites and 382 Negroes
were executed in the South.

In this period Georgia liquidated 58 bla¢ks and 3
whites for rape, Virginia 21 blacks and no whites.
North Carolina 41 blacks and 4 whites, South Caro-
lina 37 blacks and 5 whites, Florida 35 blacks and 1
white, Tennessee 22 blacks and 5 whites, Alabama 20
blacks and 2 whites, Mississippi 21 blacks and no
whites, Arkansas 17 blacks and one white, Louisiana
17 =placks and no whites, and Texas 66 blacks and 13
whites.

cussed fears cf sexual inadequacy of the Southern
white, except to say that these figures ‘)
