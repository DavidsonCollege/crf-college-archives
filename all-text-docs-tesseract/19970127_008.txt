MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1997

Today, January 27, 1996, is
Black Monday. Since I was abroad
last semester Ionly recently learned
about it and why it is taking place.
The protest is a response to the
exoneration of Michael Marlow, a
white police officer, who shot
James Willie Cooper, a 19-year-
old black man, during a traffic
stop. Marlow shot the unarmed
Cooper because he believed Coo-
per was reaching for a gun.

A five-man review board
made up of police officers deter-
mined that Marlow did not violate
departmental procedures and that
his use of deadly force was justi-
fied. Some community leaders
were dismayed with the decision
and called for a civilian review
board to investigate future similar
cases.

In light of this decision and
the further deteriorating relations

between the police and the black .

community, black leaders decided
to hold Black Monday to demon-

happiness with the present situa-
tion. During Black Monday, the

how a boycott would improve re-
lations between people and po-
lice. I also believed that this boy-
cott might only widen the gap.
But as the discussion contin-
ued, my views changed. My pro-

problem. It would help people to
understand better the feelings of
the black community.

Black Monday would also
help black solidarity. One of the
students in the class said that in

their heads in and out of a bunch

meditational repose. Then the

two female librarians are standing
around giggling over the fact that
Playboy magazine is included
among the library’s microfilm ar-
chives. After a few minutes of
listening to their infantile banter,

such tradition. Seeing as there’s
nothing worse than a school with
an inferiority complex, I say let’s

these fanatical room-seekers are
dangerous creatures come exam
time, prone to fly off the handle at
even the tiniest of provocations.
They’re also extremely savvy
creatures and have been known to
set up smoke screens at the front
door of their “special” rooms to
shoo away any would-be room
sharers. Should anyone approach
their “little domicile” in the midst
of their taking anexam, they char-
acteristically fly into a rage and
give voice to a litany of (largely
incoherent) monosyllabic prattle,
of which the only translatable part
is “My room! My room! Bam
Bam! Bam Bam!”

“Ma’am,” I addressed one of
them, “T’ll have you know that the

You’re disturbing the Great Ones.
Incidentally, ma’am, everyone al-
ready knows that the best pornog-
raphy is foundin L’espresso maga-
zine (God bless the Germans!)
which is, after all, much more
readily accessible than Playboy. I

This got me to thinking about
nudity’s place in the. world of
academia. Former Opinions edi-
tor Jeff Kent 96 wrote an article
last year calling for more sponta-
neous nudity on campus. I think

his suggestion was indeed exem-
-plary but in need of.a little fine.

Center’s move from Main Street
to the basement of Belk? What
ambiance! It’s so invigorating to
feel like you’re typing up your
term paper amid the fiery fur-
naces of hell. I actually had to
throw a disclaimer on my history
take-home essay after I found my-
self concluding it with the state-
ment, “And furthermore Jimmy
Carter was a depraved, ego ma-
niac with no redeemable charac-
teristics whatsoever... so put that
in your pipe and smoke it.”

But what’s really got me
peeved about the Computer
Center’s move is that they’ve
taken away my legendary 200 yard
(4:59 p.m.) sprints. from Main
Street to Chambers to turn in pa-
pers due by 5 p.m My times on
some of those shuttle runs
would’ve embarrassed Michael

lent means to this end. Another
student agreed with her and re-
marked that it shouldn’t only be
for one day but continue indefi-
nitely until the problem is recti-
fied.

I found this very logical. Rev-
enues of businesses would surely
decline and the businessmen would
wake up and realize something was
wrong. Then they would fight
alongside the black community for
changes to occur. The increased
support for black businesses would
also increase the influence of these
businesses in the political sphere.

Undoubtedly, someone will
clamor that Black Monday is un-
fair. Why should white businesses
be hurt when the problem is with
the police? I would respond that
boycotting businesses is a much
more effective demonstration than
picketing in front of the police
station or town hall.

I agree that boycotting busi-
nesses unfairly causes harm, but
when you look at the problem of
racism, drastic measures are needed
in order to better this situation.
