Seven Days in the Everglades Makes One Great Week

By Jonathan Harris

The dawn of the storm of the
century was the last truly innocent
morning for some members of
Davidson Outdoor’s Everglades
expedition. As we piled into two
vans on a very early and dark Sat-
urday not one of the twenty-two
students and leaders could have
imagined the things we would learn
along the way. Ed and Marlys
Daugherty were the trip leaders as
well as the drivers of the van I rode
in. Without them, we would surely
have died or at least had some
reason to complain. But they
seemed to radiate a protective
Magic-Shell coating around us that
made the following Sunday and
the rest of the week the banana
split of all natural experience—
delicious, and not to be eaten with-
out the help of several friends.

Our fifteen-hour van ride was
recorded for therapeutic reasons in
several student diaries, “Saturday.
We left Davidson and made itabout
an hour or two down the road.
Then, as we pulled out of a BP
station something so horrible hap-
pened that I cannot even tell you,
my dearest confidant, what it was.”

A gustof eighty-mile an hour wind
caught the canoe trailer and turned
it on its side, stopping the Ever-
glades expedition just two hours
outside the North Carolina border.
It became the first time that our
group had faced danger and chaos
together. We held hands and
watched with sleepy fascination as
the giant green BP sign crashed
down in the wind outside.

Inside, the BP station was dark
and full of stranded travellers.
Macaroni noodles were slowly
uncurling and congealing without
refrigeration in the deli and the
electric toilets were not flushing.
Light is not always required on a
Davidson Outdoors excursion and
toilets are a rare luxury, but there
was something important, strange
yet hopeful about the deli’s maca-
roni, a prophetic voice bubbling up
to guide our journey that we could
not yet hope to understand. Two
days later some of us would hear
that voice again. But during this
first storm we were lost in innocent
and hopeful thoughts, reading the
messages on T-shirts and hats be-
ing sold inthe store and wondering
what the wind would blow down

next. ©

Half our group stayed in the
hotel that night and half went with
Eleanor Gray’s family who lived
nearby. The next morning, with
the trailer loaded again and the
group together, we set out for
Florida. At the Florida border we
had some fresh-squeezed orange
juice. Then, we found out that the
Everglades were open for busi-
ness. Our malfunctioning head-
lights guided us to another service
station where we cooked dinner
underneath a powerful fluorescent
street lamp. But we finally made it
to the Everglades, where our story
splits in two.

We divided into two canoeing
groups, scheduled a rendezvous
and said heartfelt goodbyes. Then,
we were on the water. The water is
long in the Everglades. Long
against the horizon and short
against the bottom: twoto five feet
deep in most places. And on the
long water, you can see the sky and
clouds reflected; youcan seeegrets
and Blue Herons; you can see fish
beneath that reflecting surface and
when you getreally desperate from
too much beauty you can look over

shooting stars and an occasional
passing satellite in the sky. But

Ain't Nothin’ Like A Country Song: These May Be The Best

It would be wrong to say that
country music has historically cor-
nered the market on good lyrics.
As a matter of fact, many of the
country songs of “old” had rela-
tively little to offer in the face of
offerings of its contemporary
genres. I mean, you choose: “Yes-
terday” by the Beatles or “On The
Bayou” by old Hank?

But today’s country has some-
thing to say. And, quite frankly,
today’s pop music has less and less
to say - when I can understand
exactly what it is they’re saying.
Don’tgetme wrong; this isasweep-
ing generalization to which artists
like Arrested Developmentor Sting
certainly appeal as exceptions.

A country song, “simple” as it
may seem, addresses real and fun-
damental feelings and concerns.
Of course we can’t all identify
with what it’s like to drive a truck

down to the pool hall and kick our
boots up on the bar; but we can all
identify with what it’s like to be
head over heels in love, to be jilted

and stung, to be ready to gooutand ~

party. What makes country differ-
entis thatit spells out whatever it’s
trying to say in a way that doesn’t
confuse us with abstractreferences,
but enhances its message with
clever references to a particular
state of mind or a particular action
with which we can all identify.

I guess it’s a nice, mindless
release of energy to chant along
with Pearl Jam (or whoever it is)
“Oh-ohI-I whoa-oh!'m still alive”
over and over again. But on the
(hopefully) average day in which
you are not under the effects of a
strong hallucinogen, it is some-
what difficult to obtain any kind of
significant meaning or message
from that drone.

But wait, I don’t mean “mes-
sage” in the sense that every song
should have a political message -
far from it. I’m only suggesting
how nice it is to be able to have
something interesting to think
about in a song. A country song
will either tell you a story or de-
scribe a situation in which you will
inevitably deposit yourself for a
moment. You will smile or you
will feel your heart sink just alittle.
But you will think, react, and en-
joy.

_ these songs a try sometime:

Progress Challenges Islanders’ Survival

Daufuskie. Developers have qui-
etly begun to partition the island
and security gates now restrict
islanders from roaming free on
land they thought belonged to
them. In his novel The Water Is
Wide, Pat Conroy describes this
island’s struggle between old and
new. “Itis nota large island, nor
an important one, but it repre-
Sents an era and a segment of
history that is rapidly dying in
America. The people of the island
have changed very little since the
Emancipation Proclamation. In-
deed, many of them have never
heard of this proclamation. They
love their island with genuine af-

fection but have watched the young
people move to the city, to the
lands far away. The island is dy-
ing, and the people know it.”

The tiny island of Daufuskie
is one of the last remnants of a
dying way of life. Itused to be one
of many islands like it, islands with
their own distinct cultures and
lifestyles. The other islands have
been turned into opulent vacation
spots and stripped of their rich
