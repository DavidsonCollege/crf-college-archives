'69 Team back for 25th anniversary

Courtesy of Sports Information
Davidson College’s basketball
history is studded with outstand-
ing teams, but for most Wildcat
fans 1969 stands out as the vintage
year in an era when every year
produced a bumper crop.

The ’69 team celebrated its
25th anninversary last. Saturday
night during the halftime of the
Davidson-UTC game.

Davidson College is proud of
its basketball tradition and prides
itself on the “small school with a
big heart” reputation, but no pe-
riod in Davidson basketball his-
tory stands out more than the fabu-
lous 60’s when the Wildcats con-
sistently ranked among the nation’s
top 10.

The ’69 team won 27 games
and only lost three. One of those

was an 87-85 loss to North Caro-
lina in the NCAA East Regional
Final. j
The ’69 Wildcats ranked as
high as 2nd nationally and finished
. 3rdin the final UPI Poll of coaches.
They finished 5th in the final AP
Poll by the media.

Mike Maloy was named to
several All-America teams and was
on the cover of Sports IIlustrated’s
basketball preview edition.

The 29th of January has been
officially proclaimed “Wildcat
Day” by the Mecklenburg Board
of County Commisioners. They’re
represented by Commissioner
Lloyd Scher, who presented each
of the returning Wildcats with a
momento of their special day.

Their play brought pride to
Davidson athletics.

This caricature of the 1969
team's star player, Mike
Maloy, appeared in the
program at Saturday's game.

what of an emotional let down
after the Georgia Southern game.
We were so pumped up for it be-
cause we wanted to make them
respect us. They expected to beat
us by fifty but they only wonby 16.
The intensity just wasn’t there for
the Western Carolina game,” said
DuBose.

A highlight of the Western
Carolina game was Tonya Sharpe’s
performance from the line. Hitting
five for five, she raised her season
percentage to 82.8 percent and

moved into the Southern
Conference’s top three.

Coach Filar wants to thank the
crowd at the Western Carolina
game, Thursday night. More than
twice the size of any other home
game of the season, the crowd was
described by Filar as “one of the
best ever.”

The Wildcats will next face
Gardner-Webb, Wednesday night,
hoping to avenge a 25-point loss to
the Bulldogs last year. Davidson
will face Furman on February 5 at
home to open official Southern
Conference competition.
