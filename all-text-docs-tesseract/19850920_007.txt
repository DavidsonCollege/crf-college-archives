X-Country Finishes First Meet ,Only To Finish Last

By RAND HARTSELL

The concensus? Not very
pretty but we’re glad it’s over!

On Saturday, from the
coaches on down to the freshmen
on Davidson’s men’s and
women’s cross-country teams,

there was a collective sigh of relief
that the first meet of the ’85 season
was behind them. The men
finished ninth out of nine teams
and the women sixth out of six.
Wake Forest and the Univer-
sity of Virginia dominated both

races, with Wake scoring a sur-
prising upset of pre-meet favorite
and nationally top-ten ranked
UVA. Duke, DePaul, Georgia
State, the Citadel, Furman and
Radford all victimized the men’s
teams. The women fell prey to the

Lady Cats Field Win Over Salem College, 3-1

By EDWIN PAGE

Davidson’s field hockey team
kicked off their 1985 season last
Friday in a disappointing but not
altogether surprising manner by
losing to the University of the
South 8-0. However the Lady
Cats evened their record by beat-
ing Salem College 3-1 on Tues-
day.

The University of the South
jumped on the inexperienced de-
fense of Cats for five goals in the
first half and added three more in

the second for an easy win. Des-
pite the lopsided score Davidson
coach Patty Daley was not frus-
trated by the loss. Instead of
dwelling on the defeat, the team
worked hard at improving the
weaknesses exposed in the first
game and readied themselves for
Tuesday’s contest at Salem.

The work evidently paid off.
In the first half the contest re-
mained scoreless, but early in the
second half the Cats pulled away
on goals by senior Suzy Klineman

and sophomore Janet Bitter. That
was all the offense the Cats would
need as Salem could muster only a
single goal late in the game on a
flick just out of junior goalie Nana
Lay’s reach.

In spite of the victory, Daley
sees room for improvement, even
in the defense that allowed only
one goal against Salem. The
halfbacks are hitting the ball better
and clearing it more quickly, but
she feels they committed too
many fouls. Sophomore Mandy

same teams, except the Citadel,
Furman and Radford who don’t
field women’s teams.

The Cats were far from psy-
chologically decimated, however.
“We knew we were stepping in
high cotton,” head coach Sterling
Martin said. “We weren’t at all
unhappy considering we had only
been practicing together for a few
days.” Indeed, on the men’s side,
team captain senior Frank Hague,
senior Bob Watkins and junior
Emil Cekada, all set personal best
times for five miles. That degree
of success has been encouraging
for the men.

The performance of the team
as a whole, however unencourag-
ing compared to the competition’s
performance, has spurred some
desire in Davidson’s Harriers.
“Even though we were defeated
badly,” explains assistant coach
Sarah Patterson, “everyone has
worked hard during practice since
the Wake meet.”

Hague was __sparticularly
pleased with freshmen Bill Whit-
field and Bob Carnish’s perfor-
mances. Whitfield placed fourth
for Davidson and Carnish sixth.
“It’s good that the freshmen are
running well,” Hague said. “It
gives them confidence and moti-
vated the upper-classmen to work
harder.”

The Davidsonian conducted
‘exclusive interviews with Whit-
field and Carnish, who tied for
first in the freshman Cake Race.
Carnish spoke for both himself
and Whitfield when asked about
their impressions of their first Col-
legiate race: “Scary as Hell. Bill
and I ran together until the last
mile and a half.”

Both runners explained that
the five mile distance is a bit for-
eign to them as the standard high
school distance is 5 kilometers,

Barrett has played well at left back
and Lay is continually improving
in goal.

Daley is also looking for more
consistent intensity from the at-
tack. At the early part of the sec-
ond half, the Davidson attack was
very sharp, cutting off Salem pas-
ses and carrying the ball upfield
very quickly and this is the kind of
play Daley would like to see for a
whole game. Freshmen Suzanne
Mauze played very well at left
outside forward and sophomore

roughly 3.1 miles. “I had trouble
pacing myself,” Whitfield said. “I
went too slowly; both of us had a
lot left at the end of the race.”

Both runners look forward to
tomorrow’s meet in Lynchburg.
The hilly course suits Whitfield
and Carnish who claim to run bet-
ter over such terrain.

Women’s captain, senior Judy
Dalton, summed up both team’s
prospects for tomorrow's race.
The women face Lynchburg Col-
lege while the men face Lyn-
chburg College and Roanoke Col-
lege as well. “Those teams are
more in our league.”

When told that assistant coach
Patterson expected the Cats’
women to win the meet, Dalton
agreed: “Kappa Peddy [sopho-
more] has recovered from her
spring injury and ran very strongly
last Saturday. I expect all of us
will improve our running as
teams, although, with the hilly
course, our times won't reflect
that improvement.” Look for both
Dalton and sophomore Laura Fan-
nin to be closer to Peddy against
Lynchburg.

The men also expect im-
provbed performances over last
week’s opening meet. Lyn-
chburg’s course is hilly and has
treacherous footing. Watkins and
Hague ran most of the race to-
gether at Wake. In order to have a
successful meet agianst Lyn-
chburg and Roanoke, junior Greg
Foreman will need to overcome
the nausea that struck him at the
two-mile mark in the Wake race.
Expect to see senior Taylor
Simpson, and sophomores Chris
Fisher and Bill Breidenstein,
move up in the ranks as their ex-
perience will be a valuable asscts
in upcoming meets. If so, the con-
census next week will read: Very
pretty, let's do it again.

Susan Roarke was solid at left
link.

The Cats put their winning
streak on the line against a tough
Pfeiffer team that plays the equi-
valent of run-and-gun hockey.
Daley is looking for a tough fight,
but believes the Cats have a good
shot if they can take Pfeiffer out of
their game. “I'm very pleased
with the growth we've shown in
two games and about where we're
going.”
