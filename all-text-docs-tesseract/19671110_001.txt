Faculty To Vote On Plans
During Tuesday Meeting

Revoll Celebrated
With Red Pastry

Dr. Norman Johnson's
European history class ate
red cake to commemorate the
fiftieth anniversary of the
Russian Revolution Tuesday.

Senior Bill Schmickle. who
was picked by the class io
arrange the party, said the
purpose of .the party was not
to celebrate the Communist
revolution but to remember
the conditions which led to
the overthrow of the Russian
czar.

A Queens College student
baked the cake. Students in
the class supplied armbands
and a Russian flag for the
party.

Several other students had
planned to carry a Russian
flag at ROTC drill Tuesday
afternoon in memory of the
revolution. but they failed to
show up.

Black Booking Conference.
held last spring in Columbia.
S.C.

“Phe audience at the four-
day conference was made up
of numerous social council
representatives,” said Jen
nings, ‘‘and they accorded
the Evans Trio a standing
ovation. They were the only
group to get such an
ovation.”

One New York columnist
has evaluated Lee Evans as
“undisputed king of pianists
in the lush pop field.’ The
trio consists of the piano, a
bass and drums.

The group has been on the
night club circuit, playing
such clubs as the Sands in
Las Vegas and Basin St-
East in New York. Evans is
currently the orchestra lead-
er at the Americana Hotel in
New York.

Jennings called the group
*“half-jazz. half-modern,"’ say-
ing that they have several
modern arrangements which
he said, ‘‘are really tremen-
dous."

Following the concert, the
Social Council will provide
entertainment into the early
morning. Running concurrent-
ly from 10 p.m. on will be a
movie, Destry Rides Again,
and a combo party.

Following the combo party
there will be a blanket con-
cert, featuring Gamble Rog-
ers, a former member of the
Serendipity Singers. Coffee
and doughnuts will be avail-
able in the College Union fol-
lowing the concert until 3
a.m.

we are part of a time in
which we need most to con-
front the moral issues of war.
we find ourselves more than
ever before tempted to ignore
these issues.”

“It’s quite possible.’’ said
Aiken. “that some people of
our college will be forced to
re-examine their positions—

a rather holsum posture for’

an academic community.”

“I think the planning com
mittee has done an excellent
job of selecting program ma-
terial.’ he added. “This has
not been done necessarily to
present a balanced or a
biased position, but rather to
present material which will
stimulate discussion and dia-
logue.”"

“There is even a chance,”
he concluded, ‘‘that someone
might stick his neck out and
make a decision! This series
of programs and its resulting
dialogue hopes to help pro
vide a basis for such a decis.
ion.”

ning committee for the pro-

Dean: ROTC Not
A Liberal Art

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer

The Blue Sky Committee's
recommendations. following
its attempt to create a cur-
riculum with. fewer required
courses, include the place-
ment.of ROTC on a voluntary
basis and the removal of aca
demic credit for the first two

years.

Dean of the Faculty Frontis
Johnston summarized — the
committee's viewpoint by
saying, ‘I don't object to the
program, but to giving aca
demic credit for it. It doesn't
belong in a liberal arts pro
gram."

The present contract be
tween Davidson and the Army
calls for ‘appropriate: aca
demic: credits’ to be given
for the courses offered and

for officers of the ROTC De:
partment to have the status
of faculty mémbers.

Johnston, who chaired the
Blue Sky Committee. explain
ed the college’s reasons for
maintaining the program as
‘ta way by which students are
helped in the military obli-.
gations which face them."

The benefits of the program
—such as commissioning as
an officer, greater safety
from financial renumeration,
are still regarded as valuable.

The alternative mentioned
by both President D. Grier
Martin and Dean Johnston is
that freshman and sophomore
ROTC be placed on the same
basis as physical education.
In Martin's words. ‘‘David-
son would require a course
without credit being given.”

Woodmansee Calls For
Fewer Chapel Periods

Chaplain Scott Woodmansee
has announced his intention
to propose a cut in the num
ber of chapel periods per
week at the next meeting of
the Faculty Religious Policy
Committee.

Concerned that he is not
always able to provide top
quality speakers. Woodman
see said that his proposal
would help him to do so, and
thus make chapels ‘‘more a
part of the academic life of
the campus.”

His proposal would cut the
number of chapel periods per
week to two, with only one
speaker a week. He proposes
that the same budget be
maintained so that he would
have more flexibility in ob
taining better speakers.

The second period each
week would be allotted to

student organizations, such as
Student Council, the drama
department. and the male
chorus.

He sttgssed. however, that
he would only be securing
one speaker a week. He add
ed that the second chapel
period would not necessarily
be used each week.

“The new idea,"’ said Wood
mansee, ‘‘would give more
assurance that we could ob.
tain better speakers on pre-
scribed topics. It is not a
matter of trying to do away
with chapel: it is merely a
method of getting better
chapel speakers."

Woodmansee_ is currently
allotted a $5,000 budget per
year for payment of speak-
ers. This usually includes
payment of two speakers per
week. The new proposal

Miscellany Rejoins Board;
Handbook Bid Unopposed

After almost a year's ab-
sence The Miscellany rejoined
the Publications Board Wed.
nesday when its application
was approved by the board.

In a later meeting on Thurs-
day, the board ruled that
junior Tom Baker was an ac.
ceptable candidate for editor
of the Wildcat Handbook.

Outgoing editor Mike Mooty
reported at that meeting that
Baker was the only student
who had filed with him to

run for the editor's position.

Bruce Weihe, Student Coun-
cil Elections Committee
chairman, ruled this morning.
however, that it would not be
necessary to hold an elec-
tion.

He said that the Student
Council could declare Baker
the new editor. Sam Boyte.
Publications Board chairman.
said that the Student Council
would probably have to ap-
prove Weihe's decision before

Baker could officially assume
the editor’s position.

The Miscellany had pulled
out of the board last year to
assume more control over the
selection of its editor. In re-
joining the board, the maga-
zine stipulated that candi-
dates for editor will have to
be approved by its own Board
of Advisers before their
names are submitted to the
Publications Board for fur-
ther approval.

would enable him to double
the amount he could pay each
speaker.

Woodmansee pointed out

that he had not made the pro.
posal to the committee yet,
so he could give no indication
of how it would be received.
