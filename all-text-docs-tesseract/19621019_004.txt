College Reveals Lease /

Of Expensive Com

BY BUCK LAWRIMORE
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Davidson College has approved a lease on an IBM 1620 digital computer which
could revolutionize many departments of administration and could wind endless
hours of red tape neatly out of the way into its circuits.

“This computer will be small
but powerful enough to give
users a meaningful insight into
the potentialities of the biggest
computers.” ¢ommented Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin.

“The computer is to arrive
in December on a strictly trial
basis. We hope to decide by
May 30 whether or not it
should be a permanent part of

Patterson To Talk
At U.N. Day Fete

Dr. Ernest F. Patterson, chair-
man of the economics depart-
ment, will speak on “The United
Nations in Today's World” at a
UN Day celebration at 8 p.m.
Tuesday. Oct, 23. in the Public]
Library auditorium in Charlotte. |

Patterson will be introduced
by Harry Golden, Charlotte |
author and editor. |

Martin added.

I'r. Locke White of the Dav-

idson faculty. experienced in
the uses and limitations of the
mechanical problem - solvers,
will teach a course in program-
ming for interested students and
teachers. Since the purpose will
thus be largely educational, IBM
has reduced prices by 60 per
cent to $40,000 should the col-
lege decide to purchase it later.
Rental will run near $625 a
month. White said.

“1¢ the trial is satisfactory,”
Martin remarked, “we may
find many tabor-saving uses
for the device, such as com-
piling statistics, keeping track
of alumni and of business
transactions, recording grades
and so on.”

The limitations of such a
computer .can be expressed as
20,000 decimal digits. White
said. What this would mean in

it an extremely worthwhile in-
vestment, he added.

Martin emphasized that the
main purpose of the computer
will be educational: “It is my
feeling that computers will in-
evitably influence thinking in

many fields, and therefore it is

highly desirable that Davidson
students have a first-hand ex-
perience with one.”

“Relative to a human being,
the 1620 is a blaze of glory,”
White noted. “But it’s down-
right puny beside the ‘stretch’
computers now developed.”

He pointed out that the ma-
chine wil use binary mathema-
tics, as do all digital computers,
thus greatly multiplying the
number of columns available.
Since numbers, operating _in-
structions and letters are all
programmed the same way and
since computers never tire of
repeated steps, the machine here
would be virtually unlimited for
practical tasks and computa-
tions. ’

Announcements will be made
later on classes for those in-
terested.

trol. So much scaffolding was
required at one point that over-
all work was delayed one week
because nothing else could be
placed in the room.

Stil another valuable week
was lost when a trucking firm
misplaced the fluorescent lights
then in transit. Minor difficul-
ties threw the schedule off by
yet another week.

These difficulties, however,
seem trivial when one realizes
that Meetze did al! the archi-
techural work himself, be-
cause there was neither time
nor enough money to employ
an architect. An acoustical
engineer helped solve the
echo problem, but all the
other plans were designed
principally by Meetze.

A major problem in design
was to make the room fit in na-
turally with the building rather
than have it seem makeshift.
Meetze solved this by arranging
the color scheme to blend in
with the colors of the stone-
work around ‘the sides of ‘the
walls; this arrangement makes
the room one of the most at-
tractive on the entire campus.

Consider some of the many
features of the new room: a
panel ceiling (to perfect a-
coustics) with lighting ar-
rangements built into it, loud-
speakers providing complete
and equal coverage of the

entire room, and an attrac-
tive lighting scheme. Add to
this the practical problems of
electrical wiring, air-condi-
tioning, and heating.

Finally, mix everything to-
gether in such a manner that a
movie can be shown while the
instructor adds his comments
and the students take notes and
refer to maps on the sides of a
room with just enough light for
all these activities. All this work
was planned and designed by
Meetze who made the dome
room practically a one-man
architectural exhibition.

Although he himself gives
much of the credit for meet-
ing the deadline to the Bar-
ger Construction Company—
without whose fine help, he
stated, the room could not
have been completed in time
—the major credit for this
outstanding task must go to
Meetze.

When Davidson College fresh-
men entered this room on Sep-
tember 13, he was still trying
to dry the shellac on the tem-
porary lecturn with rubbing al-
cohol.

Yet when he again thought
over the summer’s work, he
said: “It’s not very often that
you can take problems and make
them into real advantages as
was done in the building of the
humanities room.”

Young Republicans,
Democrats Organize

BY CHARLES RAMBERG
Devidsonian Assignments Editor
Attempts to start organizations of both Young Re-
publicans and Young Democrats are now in progress on
campus. Both groups would be affiliated with their re-

spective parties.

Amid a flurry of partisan ac-
tivity, John Cameron is begin-
ning a Young Republicans Club.
“Twenty-five people have indi-
cated an interest so far,” he
stated. “That’s about what I was
hoping for—something to work
with.

“We definitely plan to asso-
ciate with the Republican
Party,” Cameron said. “The
club will not be limited to the
conservative viewpoint. We
plan to bring speakers to the
meetings and to discuss party
issues.”

“The right wing is running
rampant on campus,” comments
Union Director C. Shaw Smith,

who is attempting to stem the
flood by starting a chapter of
Young Democrats. “If you want
to stop it, you rise up and rear
your head. If you don’t, crawl
back in your cubbyhole.”
Smith is not planning to
form a militant anti-conserva-
tive organization, however. “!
am not so interested in
squeiching them (the right
wing) as in bringing their sit-
vation into total focus. No
meeting, no taliding; that’s
what's wrong.”

to bring Charlie Smith, execu-
tive director of the Mecklen-
burg Democratic Party, to the
campus soon to discuss party
issues and candidates.

Equating his interests in
young Democrats and in stud- .
ents going into government
work, Smith stated that he
thought that interesting stud-
ents in the practical realities of
the two party system would
heighten interest in government
work. He noted that the Conser-
vative Club now on campus
