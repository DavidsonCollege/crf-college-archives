Tournament, which

By DICK LILES thus the big thing com-
ing up, the reporter failed to mention the most important thing
that has happened to Davidson wrestling in the past decade.

W&L DREADNAUGHT VANQUISHED

It was a gloomy day that faced the Cat grapplers on
their trip north to face the always-tough Generals of Wash-
ington and Lee on the mats. However, the injury-ridden
locals decided that they were better than theic record showed
and got set to prove it. And this they did in determined fash-
ton. And it was Gene Craven. the plucky Captain and un-
defeated master of the 136 class in the conference, and John
Buxton who along with the default in the heavyweight class
put the match on ice. (McNeely said it was really no match.)

The loss was the Generals’ third in 47 matches and the
first time that the Davidsonians have pulled the trick during that
time. It also proves’ that the perennial champs ‘of the SC can
be pushed out of their coveted spot and that they will have a
tough time taking the tournament this weekend.

SWIMMERS FINISH STRONG

The first winning team since the tennis season of last year
to grace the campus has been the Catfish of Coach Dick Redding.
The swimmers finished with a 6-4 record and had to really pour
on the steam to cop the last five matches after opening with a win
over South Carolina. Coach Redding says that the individual stars
were few and that the good season is attributable strictly in
a team sense. It was the last appearance for sprinters Aubrey
Miree and Captain Ken Taylor, who have bolstered the team
since swimming came to Davidson three years ago. Orchids to
the swimming team and their coach.

SENIOR CAGERS CLOSE BRILLIANTLY

On the trip north to Baltimore this past weekend,
four boys ended their basketball careers in the style which
has marked their play all through the four campaigns.
The ‘Flying Four’’ have meant much to basketball here
at Davidson since first putting foot here. Captain Bill
Brooks perhaps stands out as the leader of the pack, having
led scoring for three years and being named to the ‘’Ob-
server” second-team All Southern. Besides this can be
added his brilliant play as a Freshman.

Mac McLean also dribbled his last and collected enough
assists to put him in permanent possession of third place in that
department in the nation. Mac has been the floor player with the
‘cooling down” effect on his teammates. He is honorable men-
tion All-Southern.

Al Fitzgerald and Bobby Turk also closed out and these’

two represent “Improvement Plus’’ and “Old Reliable.’’ The
other senior who is far from being forgotten could not close out
on the basketball court, but nevertheless, while he was on the
court, made himself known with his driving power and rebound
prowess. “‘Moose”’ Lazenby is still fighting that sickness off.

WILDCAT OF THE WEEK -

There is little that the students
don’t already know about the Wild-
cat of the Week. Bil! McNeely or
“Big Blue,” as he is known on the
football field, has become quite’ a
figure on our campus during his
four years here. He has contrib-
uted much to the athletic program, | .
but this week our attention is drawn | |
particularly to his wrestling,

Weighing in at 240, he is al-
ways a threat in the heavy:
weight division, His record in
the conference meets points to
this quite readily. To date he
has lost only one match in |:
dual competition, winning four ||
others and tieing twice. In the

L

a)

recent AAU meet he was seeded
second behind the popular Bill
Norris from Lejeune, but things
did not quite turn out as an-
ticipated and Mac took a spill,
but came up second. There
still remains the annual South-
ern Conference Tournament to
be held in Lexington this week-
end and the Southeastern
Olympic tryouts the following
week in which he will be a
strong contender for heavy-
weight honors.
No One Sport Man
No article on. McNeely would be
complete without mentioning his
performance in other sports. He is
a three letter man, in addition to

V. Ball, Track
Slated Next
For Frat Men

By WALLACE ABBOTT

Two more sports will soon be
usnered in on this year’s interfra-
ternity sports calendar. The latest
schedules to be releasd show that
volleyball will begin next Monday
afternoon on both the courts inside
the gym and those behnd the sta-
dium, Also on next Wednesday and
Thursday the all-fraternity track
meet will be held at Richardson
field. .
Both of these sports have been
the cause of a lot of rivalry and
competition between fraternities in
years past. In fact the high tension
of last year’s volleyball season was
the one big item that caused the
fraternity sports managers to ele-
vate it to a major sport for this
year.

As far as the track meet goes,
well you can't have any more com-
petitive spirit shown than what is
seen when all of the groups get to-
gether for the big afternoon's com-
petition. Included. in the events
which are scheduled for the meet,
are the 100, 220 and 440 yard

Practice is now in full swing for
the nearing Wildcat track season.
The Cat Cindermen will open their
schedule against Florida State Uni-
versity on the. local track on April
§.The 1952 track card includes seven
meets, three, at home, besides the

Southern Conference meet on May

16 and 17,
Hampered by cold weather,
the Davdson tracksters will
have a big job ahead in whip-
ping themselves into shape for
the opening match as the Flori-
dians have been practicing in
their warmer climate since early
January.
Frosh Bolster Lettermen
Though it is still too early to
actually tell how well the team
will stack up, Coach Pete Whittle
predicts that the 'S2 team will be
a better balanced group than last
season’s cinder squad. It is, of
course, also too early to predict
the individual standouts of the
team, Coach Whittle will have such
returning stalwarts as Tom Bree-
don, sprints; Bill White and Jim
Fickeisen, hurdles; Bill Shipley and
Bob Henry, 440-880; Tom and Dick
Stockton, distance; Bill McNeely
and Gene. Pierce, shot and discus.

Outstanding Freshmen such as
Dan Landers, sprints; and Jack
Huffaker, high jump; are among the
leading new prospects. Over 50
hopefuls have entered the race for
squad berths.

The '52 schedule reads as follows:

April -5—Florida State—David-
son,

April
Macon.

April 19—Univ. of South Caro-
lina—Davidson.

April 26—The Citadel; Univ. of
South Carolina—Charleston.

May 3—Clemson—Davidson.

May I0—N. C. State—Raleigh.

May 16-17—Southern Confer-
ence Meet—Chapel Hill.

dashes; the 660 and 3-4 mile run;
the discus and shot events; the high
jump, broad jump, 120 low hurdles
and the one-half mile relay. Each
of these events adds up to one big
afternoon next Thursday.

The Kappa Sigs came through with a victory over the
Pikas this past week and it enabled them to dethrone the Sigma

Chis for the intramural basketball championship. Having led

in every week since the season started, makes the Kappa Sigs’
championship doubly impressive. Out of the entire eleven-game
session only one defeat, at the hands of the KA’s, mars their
perfect record.

The winners this year can’t boast
any individual stars, except possi-

teams boast many outstanding

proud of a team: that hustled dur-

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests
No. 36...THE OTTER

A usually mild-mannered and easy-going

lad, he really made the fur fly when he realized
the trickiness of most of the so-called cigarette
mildness tests! He knew there was one

honest test of cigarette mildness. Millions of smokers

everywhere know, too — there’s one true test!

It’s the sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try Camels
as your steady smoke — on a pack-after-pack,
day-after-day basis. No snap judgments! Once
you've tried Camels in your “T-Zone”

(T for Throat, T for Taste), you'll see why...
