Question For

Debate Trials

Is Announced

Try-outs To Be Held Early

In December

Joe Calvin, President of the For-
lensie Council, has announced that
debate try-outs will be held some-
time during the first week jn De-
cember. Around thirty-five men
have signified their intention of
trying for the varsity debating
team, which will be composed as}

usual of six regular men and three
alternates.

The question for the try-outs is
the same as the Pi Kappa Delta,
} national debating fraternity, stand=
ard. It is: “Resolved: that the
United States shall cease to use
public funds (including credit) for
the purpose of stimulating busi-
ness” A faculty committee compos- |
ed of Dr. C. K. Brown, Prof. E. A.}
3eaty, Prof. E. J. Erwin, and Dr.
W. P. Cumming will select the de-

bating teams after the try-outs next
months.

Four men have returned from last
year’s varsity; these are Neal Scott,
Sherrard Dick Kenyon, and
John Reisner. More
are planned for this year, and it is
hoped that during the spring one
meet can be held every two weeks.
