FordleadsCarterincampus survey

By KEVIN WHITE

To cover this election, the
Davidsonian will conduct a
series of bi-monthly polls aim-
ed at discovering the influen-
cing factors of this election.
These are the results of the
first poll, dealing solely with
President Ford.

President Ford controls a
formidable lead over his De

mocratic challenger Jimmy

vey conducted prior to the
Presidential debate of Septem-
ber 23. Asked for whom they
would vote if the election were
held today, 53 percent said
they would vote for Ford, 40
percent would vote for Carter,
4 percent were split between
Lester Maddox ahd Eugene
McCarthy and the remaining 6
percent were undecided.

In analyzing President
Ford’s support among the

more closely associated with
the Republican Party, 16 per-
cent considered themselves
Democratic and 19 percent

claimed to be Independents.
These figures, when compared
to the analysis of Carter's
support in the student. body,
between Ford and Carter's
political bases. 83 percent of
Carter supporters were Demo-
crats, 4 percent were Republi-
can and 13 percent were Inde-

Ford attracts more end
ent and Democratic voters
than Carter does Independent
and Republican voters. Car-
ter’s support is Demo-
cratic, while Ford naturally
draws much support from the
Republican ranks in addition
to 35 percent from other
parties.

44 percent of the students
said they felt more closely
associated with the Democra-

Davidson students are con-
scientious voters: 9] percent
said they had plans to vote in
November.

This first poll of Campaign
"76 concentrated on the var-
ious strengths and weaknesses
associated with President
Ford's candidacy. Asked to

student body, 65 percent felt rate Ford on a scale of one to

five, with five beitig the Righ-
‘est rating, Ford received the -
highest rating in restoring
trust in the White House.
Ford was rated the lowest in
his relations with Congress.
One of Ford’s possible weak
points is his association with
former President Nixon, rang-
ing from Ford’s domestic and
foreign policies to his pardon
of Nixon. 61 percent agreed
that Ford’s administration

was a continuation of Nixon’s
basic policies. 57 | 57 percent agree
with the pardon, 77 percent

felt the pardon was not an
issue in this campaign but 53
percent said they did not think
it would be unfair if Carter
brought the pardon up as a

_ An overwhelming 81 per-
cent felt Ford should not bear
the political responsibility for
Watergate. Thus, the Nixon
association and the pardon
seem to be negligible factors in
the voters’ minds, as indicated

by Ford’s 13 percent margin
over Carter.

results for other questions on
the questionnaire, The results
were calculated from a total of
455 returned questionnaires.

PIRG initiates new study,
emphasizes penal reforms

Pinding alternatives to be-
ing locked up and deprived of
social interaction, a pursuit
that hes captured the atten-
‘tions of Davidson students for
many years, has now become a
project for the Davidson
Chapter of NC PIRG (North
Carolina Public Interest Re-
search Group).

The prisoners PIRG will
concern itself with are not
persons in the North Carolina
State Prison System. PIRG
has begun a study which will
culminate in recommendations
for state-wide prison reform.

Minister to Students Rush
Otey and Professor of Sociol-
ogy Robert D. Ruth are assist-
ing PIRG in organizing the

=, prisoners in the Huntersville

unit for several years. Ruth
regularly holds a seminar on
Soe oad cabteal tases

in the spring term at David-
son.

NC PIRG State Chairperson
and Davidson Senior John
pea a to receive

————

wide support from other inter-
ested students at Davidson.
““We seem to have struck a
nerve in the students with
these issues,”” said Hedrick.
““Never before have we had
this many people attend an

organizational meeting like we
had September 20.”

Hedrick suggested that
the turn-out of Davidson stu-
dents had been so great that
he would push to make prison
reform a state-wide PIRG pro-
ject.

Monday, Davidson PIRG
members and interested others
heard from Jeff Campbell, an
ex-convict and director of
ECHO, a group of released
prisoners. Campbell suggested
some of the prison reforms
that were necessary in North
Carolina. He particualrly
pointed to overcrowding of the
state’s prisons as a problem to
be solved.

“There is always the bur-
eauctaey-of the system that is
very hard to deal with.’
advised Campbell. “There are
numerous roadblocks to edu-

‘now in the system,
‘only 900 felons. The others

these is public apathy. People
speak of ‘our roads’ or ‘our
state parks’ but never of ‘our
prisons’.” said Campbell.

If the prisons of North
Carolina do not recieve much
interest from the state’s citi-
zenry, the prisons do receive a
large number of the state’s
citizens inside their gates.
North Carolina has the largest
per capita prison population in
the United States.

“There are 13,600 people in
the North Carolina System.
There is only space for
10,200,” said Campbell. “‘We
are criminalizing so many
people in this state, it is about
time for somebody to become
aware of the situations,’’ he
continued.

Campbell advised against
the building of more prisons.
His contention is that propos-
als for new prison space come
from politicians seeking to run

on “Law and Order tickets.”
The election of such politicians
will only add to the problem of
criminalizing non-criminals,
according to Campbell.

“Of the 13,600 prisoners
there are

have been incarcerated for
driving without a license, or
missing an alimony pay-
ment,” said Campbell.

One system of education for
prisoners that is now in use is
the Street Academy. The

. Street Acdemy is a school in

Charlotte for juvenile delin-
-quents and others who are not
: able to fit into a regular achool
,Syatem. PIRG will have some
waggostions for continuing
expanding the Street Ac-
ademy idea so that it may in-
chads the state's prisoners.
