THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1991

Ever since the straps popped
on my father’s infant-toter and I
bounced onto the roof, off the gutter
(which he was cleaning), and out
into the crisp Autumn air, I have
loved Fall.

NextI remember watching the
house turn all the way around and
feeling Dad thump beside me.
Nestled in a downy cushion of
parti-colored leaves below our
eave, I wiggled my little arms,
flailed my little tocs, and began
cramming oak fronds into my
mouth.

In the front cover of her Bible
my Mother wrote that night,
“October 19, 1969... he squeaked
like a happy chew toy when he hit.
The chill wind brushed beneath
my hair, Father looked up at me,
and we smiled.”

Fall saved my life.

And Fall got my life rolling. I
counted backwards and nine
months before I took my first breath
was October.

If I ever get my colors done, I
hope I’m a Fall. A discerning eye
has informed me, however, that
fair haired people tend to be springs,
or some other such uncapitalized
season. I hope not. All that pollen

and reproductive imagery. Oocky
stuff. As some famous dead person
stated, “April is the cruelest
month.” Translated I think this
means, “Hmmm, every living

not frequent the Davidson campus
where winter means colder rain
(and some say colder honey buns
(a gender neutral term you’ll be

organism but me seems to be
getting some.” Tough times.

And cute little spring-bud-
ding green things don’timpress
me either, especially ones that
flower. You'd think the little
shoots planned to live forever.
Pretentious bastards.

Only summer could be
worse. The scenery’s like green
paint on a window, and adecid-
edly pale chest testifies to the
author’s backsliding reverence
for the sun. My cousin, John,
has a very wise, fat and happy
golden retriever named Erma
who knows what’s what. Each
summer John fills up a small,
plastic baby pool with water in

which Erma patiently awaits,

nox.

Winter’s OK, sometimes, if the
snowballs stick together. Warm
cocoa, blankets, and a fresh little
honey bun to enhance the meta-
bolic potential can be nice, too.
Unfortunately, such pleasantries do

Kyle Kinner:
Way Above and Beyond Birkenstock

Well, hello Birkers, its thattime
again. Time for another install-
ment in that hair-raising serial,
“Life in Hell--Washington Edi-
tion.” Too bad. It may be that time,
but that’s not what I had in mind.
What am I, Andy Rooney? In-
stead, Ill just tell you that abso-
lutely nothing interesting has hap-
pened since last week, aside from
getting to stand in the “rent-a-
crowd” on the White House lawn
and wave spastically as the Presi-
dentof the United States arrived in
a big, tax-dollar guzzling Marine
helicopter with the King of Mo-
rocco in tow. Of course, as a
Washington insider, these events
are old hat by now. Oh, I crashed
my firstreception yesterday as well.
Good salmon and free beer. Other
than that, . . . nada.

You'll be happy to note that
this correspondent doesn’t just sit
around the office and eat bagels
while musing over the Post (al-
though I mused for six hours yes-
terday). No, Davidson is always
on my mind (occupying the James
Taylor Memorial Lobe). Specifi-
cally, I’m always looking for ways
to impress you people. (Hey, so
I’m shallow. I’m the kind of per-
son that doesn’ tautomatically think
of the big, green expanse between
the obelisk and the Capitol when
someone mentions the “mall.’’)
Equipped with only aphone andan
infinite amount of free time, I

decided that the old back-page
wrestler interviews just won’t cut
it when the Davidsonian is lucky
enough to have a Washington
bureau chief based right here in the
“beltway.”

So I called Dick Cheney. Or
rather, I called the number listed in
the government phone book next
to Dick’s name. Of all Bush’s
coterie of cabinet secretaries,
Cheney seems most willing to
forego the “kick-ass” attitude in
favor of technical management
based on expert opinion. He’s not
James Watt, but hey . . . who is?
Anyway, would you believe that
Dick Cheney doesn’t even answer
hisown phone? Itseems to me that
such a down-to-earth kind of guy
would be happy to pick up the
phone, when it occasionally rings,
and talk to the folks back home.

One is reminded of the Civil
War general who despised the
media. He was convinced that if
he shot all the reporters following
his campaign, within twenty-four
hours there would be a morning
edition from hell. Perhaps the
Secretary is of the same mind.
Suffice it to say, Dick cannot be
reached by the real people who
made his appointment possible.
Supposedly, he was “very busy,”
or something. In any event, 1 ended
up talking to his secretary, who
wa very kind in transferring me to
someone else, who listened

pleased to notice (for that matter,
an objectneutral term (I don’t think
I want to touch this one further (not
that I’m a prude or anything (you
know, with a little effort anyone
can be politically correct)))))).
Now, at long last gentle reader,

thoughtfully and then transferred
me again. After the fourth trans-
fer, I was finally able to find some-
one able to confirm or deny the
rumor that there actually is a man

’ named Richard Cheney who may

or may not be Secretary of De-
fense. They’reacagey little group
down there at the Pentagon. Un-
fortunately, they’realsoa busy little
group. It doesn’t look like I’ll be
able to meet with Dick before
November. Apparently, such
dubious journals as the Washing-
ton Post and the L. A. Times have
first dibs on the Secretary (notice,
he gets a big “S”, while the woman
who makes his coffee gets a little
“s5.””)

That still leaves every other
official and bureaucratic minion in
the Washington area who, depend-
ing on schedule and availability,
would probably be willing to talk
to the press (even The
Davidsonian). Let’s throw theonus
on you, the reader. Who would
you like to get the Davidson per-
spective on, Birkenstock style?
Think of the possibilities . . . .

I know for a fact that Helms
would probably talk to me (sur-
prise). But what about Kennedy?
Or Tom Foley? Or the famous
“other” Jesse, who still resides in
the district? The alternatives are
literally endless, although, as in
the case of your mid-term grades,
don’ tget your hopes up. Lobbyists

with North Carolina as the typing
paper, Nature as the goocky pig-
ments, and God on the finger paints,
please welcome . . . Fall! Some
time in thenext month, dear reader,
climb to the top of your favorite
administration building and take
inthe most spectacular curtain call
the world will ever know -- 43
zillion green things kickin’ the
bucket with style -- goodness but
it’s inspiring.

Fall is like Ted Williams hit-
ting a home run in his last at bat or
Elmer Fudd slipping on the hunt-
ing plaids one more time in search
of Wabbits even though he knows
he will shoot himself incessantly
in the face. The fleeting glory and
grand failure of an orange leaf
makes life worth avoiding for a
day so you can rake up a great big
pile and jump in it.

Autumn afternoons unfold like
a La-Z-Boy with a well worn dent
for your butt, and the evenings
smell better. So some night when
the Union’s closed and the fog is
hovering low, step into the graying
eve and try to walk real slow. With
the misty curtain drawn enough to
fuzz the walkway lights, shim in
the glimmer, flinch in the glint,

are a different story entirely, how-
ever. They’ll talk to Noriega if
they think they can get some free
press out of the general. ACTUP,
Operation Rescue, NARAL,
NOW,NRA, Queer Nation, oreven
. .. the animal rights ilk (rhymes
with elk, wonderful fur). Every-
body’s got an angle.

“Ladies and gentlemen, chil-
dren of all ages... come one,come
all, to the greatest circus on earth.
See them posture and prevaricate,
disseminate half-truths, and even
outright lies. They can turn back-
flips that would make the great
Luigi blush, and they always land
on the right side of an issue, They’re
the famous, stupendous, colossal,
Washington politicians. Paid a
hundred thousand tax dollars year,
they accomplish less than your
average plumber, though both work
in the same medium. If your taste
tends toward the exotic, spend some
time in our Keating Gallery of
Rogues, where the old and the
‘scandal-ridden go to die. Or, if
rare and unusual is your fare, visit
the mysterious Larrouchsky, and
listen as he spins his web of con-
spiracy and fear (also available
from Scribner & Son, 22.95).”

Now, I don’t mean to charac-
terize this city as a latter-day
Gomorrah; Sodom maybe, but not
Gomorrah. Instead, to misquote a
dead Prussian, “Legislation is like
sausage, one would not want to see

and don’t pass up the sights.

Pardon me, I really like Fall
(and comma-splices, too, I dig
‘em).

If Nature leaves (getit? leaves?
... Nature? anyway) you flat may
want to turn to Art -- the new
sitcomscome in the Fall -- orsports.
Football! (I see you drooling) A
truly repulsive pastime redeemed
by the fact that some day I/may see
aman hit so hard that his cup flies
right out of his pants.

Seck out your niche and learn
to appreciate a season’s fade . . . or
is itaseason that fades? Whatever,

Tomorrow morning after
you’ ve slipped a musty flannel over
your duckheads and stepped out-
side, and it’s a little on the chilly
side .. . you begin to turn around,
and .. . Hold the Shootin’ Match
(as Gramps used to sort of say)!

Leave the pile jacket where it
is. Take twenty brisk steps into the
crispness and‘on the twentieth,
breathe deep. Suck in the chill.
Relax. Bend down and pick up a
shrivelled leaf --is it brown? or-
ange? notice the desiccated veins
and brittle stem, must be one of the
first to pass away this year -- and
cram it in your mouth.

it being made.” Which is essen-
tially true of the ‘entire cultural
milieu this city has built around
itself. Its probably necessary (or
inevitable) to governance, but its
not very attractive. Those pictures
you see of the Capitol dome and
the Washington Monument at the
end of the broadcast day on your
local PBS affiliate don’teven begin
to approximate what this place
really looks like. But that’s why
I’m here. And.as long as I’m here,
I might as well talk to as many
people as possible (the good, the

‘bad, and the Kennedys). What

better excuse than an interview to
get my footin the door? So, here’s
your chance. If there’s someone,
for whatever reason, you’d like to
hear from, and its not Bush or
Quayle, tell Dave Thompson and
I'll see what I can do. You never
know, maybe I’ll get to talk to
Dick after all.

P.S. I’m writing this while I
wait for a phone'call from a sur-
prise mystery guest. If he callsme
back before the deadline, I’ll inter-
view him, and you’ll never even
get to read this social diatribe 0’
mine. Hmmm.... :

P.P.S. And as for last week’s
column, no one need fear that they
risk not being offended by this
journalist. Vivé l’indépendence.

of us striving hardest for that ex-

cellence. One of the most coura-

undertake is to open our minds and
learn BASIC, in spite of the wide-
spread misconceptions about the
superiority of Lotus 1-2-3. Let us
not dwell on the standards we are
pressured to conform to in a larger
group. Rather, we should strive to
move forward and upward as tech-
