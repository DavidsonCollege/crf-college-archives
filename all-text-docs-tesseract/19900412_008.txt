Deeper Problems for the Planet:
Beyond Gripes and Moans

By DERRICK WILLARD '91

Gloom and doom. Gripe and Moan.
I guess many people feel as if thatis all
they hear today concerning the state of
the world environment. One cannot
open a news magazine, newspaper or
watch televisionnews without becom-
ing aware of atleast one environmental
disaster daily. The media have rallied
to the cause of environmentalists,
awareness is in vogue. And much of
this information, I fear, goes inone ear
and out the other. We are bombarded
and overwhelmed with the problems,
with the negative. It is one of those
facts of human nature--people tire
quickly of “bitchin’ andmoanin.’” We
all feel the frustration of not being able
to learn and live the answers, the posi-
tive.

With the rising tide of environ-
mentalism, it does seem that many
people feel they can make some posi-
tive impact on the problems. How-
ever, we all feel as individuals that our
actions can do little to affect larger,
world-wide problems like ozone de-
pletion. Steps can be taken, but they
oftenseem so futile or small. This is an
attitude problem, a problem of percep-
tion. This is a problem lying beneath
the problems we read of each day. We
have a very hard time grasping prob-
lems long term and globally. It is a
weakness of human nature that we
possess a temporal and spatial imme-
diacy which belittles the benefits of

individual action. If we cannot'see the”

immediate benefits, of our actions, we
tend to believe that they have had no
impact.

There isa solution, asimplechange
of attitude that can affect the things we
hear so much about as problems. You
have to believe in the importance of
individual action. Driving your car to
the post office does make a difference,
a negative one. Leaving you lights or
radio on when not around to use them
does make a difference. Buying
styrofoam does make a difference.
Small actions we can affect, we can
contribute to solutions by our individ-
ual positive actions. Unfortunately for
mostpeople this means thatnasty word,
“sacrifice.”

Yet another problem lies beneath
thedaily gripe and moan, another point
of perspective. Consider this, we have
been raised in the world’s most tech-
nologically advanced age, nurtured by
the comforts of labor saving machines,
and carried all over the Earth in record
times. We have been given almost
every “convenience” to separate our-
selves from “nature.” Houses separate
“inside” from “outdoors.” There are
air conditioners to keep the air the
temperature we want it, and heaters to
do the same. We have deodorant to
cover our natural smells and clothes to
cover our birthday suits.

Ofcourse, there a millions of prod-
ucts which have been made to improve
the human condition, to provide com-
fort, ease, to save time. We also have
watches to put the world in order and
boundaries and property to further
order it spatially (we own apiece of the

Earth, even after death). Yes, humans
have found uncountable ways to tame,
shape, claim, alter, build, mold, and
replant the resources of the Earth for
the benefit of humanity. And there lies
the crux of our dilemma. We have
been raised on the “‘inside”--we have
been taught that man is separate from
nature. We have seen nature oas atool,
a resource for our immediate benefit.

And today wesee the effects of our
attitude, they are apparent in the news
every day. Yousee, this is not another
gloom and doom session, but a call to
reexamine perspective, the deeper
problem. Perhaps a species that only
considers its own benefit, without
regard*for its kinship to the Earth is
missing a vital part of its own identity.
Wehave to realize that we are a part of

world around us at respect
and care for it prevents disaster. And
of course, some will wonder at such a
radical notion, but I believe that it is
the perspective that counts, that can
make a difference. Maybe this idea
will become more apparent one day,
when humanity has to start consider-
ing life in terms of survival instead of
comfort.

Natural systems gravitate toward
cooperation over competition, homeo-
stasis over expansion. Perhaps human-
ity will have to relearn cooperation
and kinship with nature, to gain a per-
spective that the natives of this planet
once possessed, in order to survive.

A Child in the
Dominican Republic

By JOE THOMAS '90

Her enormous eyes glared then
danced as she peered beyond the metal
gates that stood between us. She was
only a child, and because of this I
found myself touched by this poten-
tially hostile gesture and disarmed by
a winsome aura of tenderness about
her. She had marched up to the win-
dow very purposefully.

My own gaze seemed to be of
subtle amusement to her, and I imag-
ine it is because therein lay my prover-
bial soul, and my outright curiosity. I
hesitated to react lestI drive her away,
yet I longed to touch her somehow.
The setting was in the middle of the
small town of Los Minos, in a section
of Santo Domingo much like any other.
It was a peculiar scene.

Asmall, poor, dark haired, brown-
skinned girl, aged ten was cross-exam-
ining a well-fed, brown-skinned, dark
haired foreigner who blurted spanish
words unintelligibly in an effort to
“reach out to her.” It must have been
vaguely humorous to her, but she was
very diplomatic and instead of gig-
gling, gently reached out a small hand
to clasp mine. In a heartbeat she had
won me over completely.

As countless other children scur-
ried about on the streets behind her
playing the games that they do, I
couldn’ thelp but wonder what her life
was like here. There she stood on the
street, while I sat on the veranda of a
local man’s home. Speaking volumes
of the disparity between us] sat couched
in luxury, she stood barefoot and lean-
ing against the open air metal grating.
Yet despite this she managed to be an

-enchantingly beautiful little girl, and

for amoment the barrier was breached.
Very soon I discovered that the metal
barrier was ironically the reason she
could trust me.

We talked for a few minutes, and I
don’t know really what it was we said.
The words were not important.
Throughout our time I began to have a
very real sense of why it was she
allowed me to intrude upon her busy
day...

So ona hopeful whim, I asked her
if she would like to be my little sister.
It was a strange question, but I ex-
plained the bestI could thatIhadnever
had a little sister ( I felt certain she
would be anexcellentone). This caused
her to spill out an enormous smile
which she hurriedly retrieved lest I
should see it. ButI did see it and in that
instant I understood something about
that little girl.

More than anything else, this little
girl named Merinesa longed to be
cherished by the heart of a brother,
And for amomentremoved from time,
Thad offered to be just that. [know that
my heart had overstepped the bounds
ofreality, and there wasno way I could
really ever be her brother, but for just
that one moment I wanted to hug her
and hold her closely. And so I rose to
leave the veranda and join her on the
street. And then the moststartling thing
occurred,

Merinesa’s gentle eyes suddenly
became fearful. Bewildered, I precari-
ously stepped forward past the parti-
tion that separated us. She grew more
and more wary asI drew closer. Though
Itried tolether sense my sincerity, she
remained frightened. There was some-
thing else operating here besides the
fear of strangers, sol gestured to one of
the females on our trip to come over to

us. I returned to my place behind the
bars of the veranda, and watched as
Debbie gently placed her arms around
Merinesa and comforted her. The fear
was gone. Moments later, after Debbie
had left, Merinesa returned to stand in
front of me, and she gently placed her
hand in mine again. What had un-
nerved this little child?

And then it became painfully clear,
In all likelihood, this beautiful child
had probably been abused by a male
figure in her life. Behind the bars, Mer-
inesa felt that I could not threaten her,
and she could “trust” me. Without the
bars she could not express herobvious
desire for the strong touch of a male’s
hand.

From the change inhercomposure
Tknew it was true. As she continued to
hold my hand she refused to make eye
contact. I was absolutely helpless as
my emotions ran a complete gamut
from anger to sorrow. And I mostly
felt very unable to alleviate her suffer-
ing, unable to even begin to under-
stand what her life was like and all she
had faced. We soon had to leave that
place, and as I parted company with
this girl, we gave her money and told
her to hide it, hoping that she could get
something for herself later. As I left, ]
prayed for her and for children like he1

_all over the world, for in that moment

that was all that was left for me to do.
But something inside me told me that
my prayer would begin to be answered
as I changed, and realized: that is
where change should begin.

For starters, it is possible to make
an enormous impact with very little
sacrifice. For anywhere from 10:208 a
month through various organizations
like World Vision a little child like
Merinesa could be lifted out of poverty
and into dignity, as she receives basic
health care, education, and sustenance.
Amazing. Imagine for a moment, if
our entire student body picked up one
child per student. We wouldn’t have
to give up very much, perhaps a six
pack here and there, or perhaps not
even that. And a whole village of chil-
dren would have hope. We have so
much we can give.

To continue, you don’ thave to go
to the third world to find Merinesas.
Merinesa was a glimpse at a singular
truth: every woman that I am privi-.
leged to meet is a potential Merinesa,

"a beautiful, hopeful little girl, who

wants to trust the male figures in her
life. Every womanis somebody’ s little
girl, and deserves all the love and ful-
filled promises that entails.
Itmademe think ofevery girlThad
every taken advantage of, and every
virtue committee meeting I had sat in
on, laughing my loudest, as we de-
faced someone’s little girl, and de-
scribed what one of us had done with
her the night before in a drunken stu-
por. I willingly chose to participate,
and I neverreally ever gaveita thought.
I may have been creating Merinesas
out of little girls, who wanted nothing

‘more than the love of aman they could

trust.

Sure, many of these “little girls”
were grown up women making deci-
sions, governed by the same hormones
and lusts that drive men, but] think our
misguided sexuality is a societal ruse,
when all is peeled away. Deep inside,
we long to trust each other and offer
ourselves to one another in committed
love. In search of this, we'll endure the
games we must play, regardless of the
