Two Perspectives On
Mardi Gras In The Big Easy

By Rebekah Fanning
and Emilie Treumann

New Orleans is definitely not

your average American city and,

during Mardi Gras, itis almostlike ”

visiting another country. That’s
why it was so perfect to bring my
friend Emilie from Amsterdam to
my hometown for Carnival. As a
native New Orleanian, I was ready
to brave the crowds of crazed Mardi
Gras fanatics to get my hands on
all the beads, cups, and underwear
I could. (Worthless, plastic para-
phernalia seems to suddenly in-
crease in value during Mardi Gras
season.)

Today’s article is not so much
about health as it is about choco-

States wouldn’t be the same with-

Never having missed it before,
I could hardly wait to get home to
experience the unique atmosphere:
jazz bands playing Mardi Gras
music in the French Quarter, little
kids scampering everywhere shov-
ing and grabbing for beads, and
drunk adults shouting and dancing
in the streets (and also scampering
everywhere shoving and grabbing
for beads).

Although Emilie did not know

quite what to expect, she immedi-
ately felt at home in downtown
New Orleans, which reminded her
alot of Amsterdam, especially the
artists and musicians on the streets.

- country buys 11% of all beans

harvested. It has been estimated
that the average American eats
around 10 pounds of chocolate per
year, but the Swiss, Austrians, and
Belgians eat even more.

Cacao beans are shipped into
Philadelphia, and then on to vari-
ous manufacturers. Each manufac-
turing company has its own secret
recipe/variation on how to make
chocolate, but the basic procedure
is the same.

Cacao beansare fermented and
dried before shipment. Fermenta-
tion is a flavor-releasing process
which must be done at exactly the

right time; underripe beans which

are fermented will develop a
“hammy” taste, andoverripe beans
will not have enough flavor, Once
in the United States, huge machines
in a chocolate factory clean and
roast the beans, at which pointthey
are called cocoa. Then the beans
are shelled and ground, yielding a
substance called chocolate liquor.

International Night Features
students From 14 Countries

By Jay Chaudhuri

On Thursday evening, March
7 the International Committee of
the Union Board presented: the
second annual International Night.
The event brought together 52
students from 14 countries.

The evening started with the
traditional lamp-lighting cere-
mony. Afterward Sharon Cheah ,
Julie Tisha, Michelle Siee, Suz
Mathieson, Vincent Choo, and Ken
Lane performed a dance from
Southeast Asia. Then, Don Jayas-
inghe sang a Sri Lankan folk song.
Ugandans Philip Mone and An-
thony Mubiru also sang a tradi-
tional folk song from their home
country. The event also had an
Eastern European flavor when
Janko Narat on acoustical guitar:
and Irene Arsov sang a Yugoslav-
ian scout song, Christina Lopez
Tbanez of Guatemala and Beatrice

We both enjoyed a fantastic trum-
pet solo by a vivacious little eight-
year old jazz musician in Jackson
Square.

By the end of the trip, Emilie
had not only. learned how to say
“New Orleans” right (not New Or-
leenz), but-also learned not to be
surprised when men would yell
occasionally, “Show your $%$s!”
to passers-by (and that women ac-
tually responded to that!)

Basically, combining both in-

ternational and native perspectives, °

we. concluded that Mardi Gras is
just another excuse for Americans
to get drunk and have a good time.

unsweetened baking. chocolate.
Under pressure, a fat called cocoa
butter can be extracted. The dry
remains are called cocoa powder.

Chocolate as we know it con-
sists of chocolate liquor plus vary-
ing amounts of sugar, added cocoa
butter, milk, and vanilla. “Bitter-

sweet” chocolates have 35% .

chocolate liquor by weight. Dark
chocolates have 15%, and milk
chocolates have 10%. White
chocolates may not have any
chocolate liquor at all; they con-
tain mainly sugar, milk and cocoa

Lecithin is sometimes added
to smooth out chocolate’s texture.
Some manufacturers add salt; some
don’t use vanilla.

Health: Around the tum of the
century, all chocolate was consid-
ered “pure” and “healthful”. Per-

find chocolate so enjoyable, re-
search has continued to try and
find some proof that it is “good for

Jean-Philippe of France performed
a Caribbean dance.

Aradashir Dubash of India
played a jazz medley on the piano,
Afterward, Beatrice Jean-Philippe
and Jerome Lauck of Southern
France, Jorge Pardo of Puerto Rico
and Hein Dang of the U.S. per-
formed a French skit. Twins Rira
an Mira sang a variety of Korean
gospel songs. Then, Annette
Gutberlet and her partner per-
formed the famous German waltz.
Ema Yin sang a Chinese folk song;
and finally, Mika Nabeshima and
Asoka Yoshi of Japan, and
Marshall Adams of the U.S. dem-
onstrated the popular sport of Sumo
wrestling in a satirical way for the
audience. The evening concluded

with a fashion show in which par-
ticipants donned their native cos-
tumes.

Indeed, the evening was a
success. As Prem Manjooran, co-
chairperson of the International
Committee, said, “It is a perfect
example of how Davidson students,
irrespective of their background,
can come together in mutual en-
deavor and derive simple enjoy-
ment in eachother’s company and
from each other’s creativity.”

Co-Chairman Harin de Silva,
concurred,

“It brought together people
from all over the world and glori-
fied the diversity of Davidson.”

The masters of ceremonies for
International Night were Bob
Hornsby and Jay Chaudhuri.

Women are everywhere at
Davidson. Even Belk, that bas-
tion of masculinity, usually holds
afew at any given time. They are
students, faculty, maintenance
staff, eating and cooking in eat-
ing houses, secretaries and ad-
ministrators for whom they work,
-- women pervade almost every
facet of life here. Perhaps too
many appear in some of those
positions and too)few in others,
but they all make it impossible to

avoid seeing them constantly.
But do we really see them?
Ordo we just take their existence
for granted? Come on, they’ve
been here foralmosttwenty years
now; what’s the big deal, right?
- The Big Deal is that March
is National Women’s Month, and
that gives us an excuse to regain
our appreciation for them. Often
the only way to understand some-

thing so familiar is to remove it
and study it as extraordinary.

Allen Compton, a Davidson
graduate himself, has done this.
Nowinthe UnionGallery women
are everywhere at all times, but
in abstract form. Allen photo-
graphed “Women at Davidson”
and his beautiful black and white
prints will be hanging through-
out March. With photography he
has extracted women from the
everyday andcommonplace and
so demanded our attention and
respect.

Allen does not focus on only
one aspect of women, but in-
stead shows their prevalence in
all domains.

He reminds us that our pro-
fessor, a fellow student, and
perhaps the person who cleans
up after us in our dorms have a
common bond. They are all
women. i

_the way we do.

For a while it was thought that
stearic acid, a saturated fat in
chocolate and beef, lowered cho-
lesterol: levels. The study that
“proved” this, however, was
flawed.

Chocolate contains phenyle-
thylamine (PEA), a substance
similar to the hormone produced
“when people fall in love”. It was
hypothesized that people crave
chocolate after a break-up in order
to bring levels of this hormone
back up to par, but there is not
enough PEA in chocolate to really
do that.

Besides the taste and pleasant
memories associated with choco-
late, we probably have cravings
for chocolate because, like all car-
bohydrates, ithas acalming effect.
At the same time, the caffeine in

chocolate acts as a stimulator; the

chocolate consumer gets the best
of both worlds. For some people in
a Johns Hopkins study, chocolate

was a more effective mood eleva-
tor than a drink or a cigarette.
Chocolate is not addicting, in the
sense that no physical withdrawal
effects occur when it is not eaten
for a period of time.

Synthetic chocolates have not
been successful because the dis-
tinct flavor of cocoa beans -is
complicated and hard to reproduce.
Barat chocolates, found in some
department stores, are a halfway
attempt at synthetic; they contain
tofu in place of milk products, and
organic cane juice instead of re-
fined sugar.

Before you write it offas “junk
food”, know that chocolate con-
tains vitamin A, phosphorus, cal-
cium, niacin, riboflavin, thiamine,
potassium, protein and iron. Com-
pared to lowfat milk, of course,

of any of these nutrients. But it
