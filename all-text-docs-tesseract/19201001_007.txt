ton Irving.

He received his college education
at Davidson College being in’ the
class of 67. Later he went to the
Gniversity of Virginia and took
same special work there, and read
law under Chief Justice Richmend
Pearson. Fle entered politics early
in life, making his first speech when
only twenty years of age. He mar-
ried Miss Nina Deaderick of Knox-
ville. Tenu., in 1878. . In 1880 he was
elected tu the legislature from
Stokes County: and from Cleveland

in 1904, and served until 1909, Four
things during his administration
actively engaged his attention:

town, his fiative state and his coun- ;

his friends, his family, his
try. He kept. with fidelity. the oath
and covenant that he entered into
with his Mother State when he first
assumed the robes of a priest in her
templar Court of Justice, by giving.

absolutely giving, his life to the.ex-"

acting duties of a toilsame and
strenuous compliance with the reé-
quirments of that gift. According ts
the writers of the ancient law there
is but one word which of itself im-
plics 4 covenant whenever
wherever used in a convevance of

an estate and that is the verb “to,

give.”

“Day upon day, and vear upen
vear as he went to his work, with
joy and eagerness, ta be sure, we
saw him giving his suberb physical,
mental and moral strength, towards
the keeping of his covenant as a
lawyer, and after he retired from
the practice, giving its residue on
bchalf of the state and nation in
their striving for civic righteous-
ness and goud government, Ne son
of the state, of his day and genera-
tien, gave more of himself for the
upbuilding and couservation of its
best interests, We had an adeal of
usefulness that he coustantly kept

and never losing sight of the Polar

the best forces of human life.

erstwhile, grasped with fondness

North Carolina.

After he left the executive man-
sion, he hegan to practice law with
the frm of Glenn, Manly and Hen-
dren of Winston-Salem. He always
enjoyed a large practice and was
nated especially for his power be-
fore the jury. He was a forceful.
carnest speaker, belicving that the
handling of facts well told is more
convincing than mere cloquence.
While a student at Davidson College
he won several medals in the liter-
ary society for his wonderful gift
as a speaker.

Death came last Spring while on
a trip to Canada as a member of a
boundary commission for the U. S.
Government.

In a memorial service held by the
Forsyth County Bar Association
the following excerpt from the
resolutions adopted will give briefly
an estimate as given by his asso-
ciates, it follows:

“Before being called by the more
than 2,000,000 (two million) people
of North Carolina, to be their Chief
Executive, Robert Broadnaux Glenn
had achieved the distinction of be-
ing one of the ablest lawyers in his
native state, and he had been for
more than 30 years one of the most
prominent Gnd distinguished mem-
bers of the Forsyth County Bar.
This career as a member of the legal
profession, was characterized by

life.”

There is no other institution or
of her loval
aiumnus, Bobert) Broadnaux Glenn,
than Davidson College and it is the

must records and traditions that such men

ws these set. that makes Davidson
the noble and honored institution
she is. A
