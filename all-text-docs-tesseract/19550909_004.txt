Now that you are completely en-

probably think that spare time is
only a thing of the past. After you
become settled in your rooming
situations and class schedules, you
will find that there are a few

moments now and then that you],

may call your own. In the College
Union you have always close at
hand one of the finest physical
plants possible for taking positive
advantage of the spare time which
you have.

These past two days, many of
your orientation activities have
been centered in the Union and
by now you should be generally
acquainted with the facilities for
entertainment available — music,
books, games, refreshments, etc.
You have not, however, observed
the Union in a typical situation,
and it will be quite a while before
you do so, and before you will
really understand what the pur-
pose of the Union is—a place
where you can pursue leisure-time
education. No matter what your
interests are, you will be able to
find materials or equipment suita-
ble for your puposes. (If we don't
have it, tell us-and we'll try to get
it; if we can't get it, we'll make

During orientation, representa-

‘Y’ Doi
oings
By DAN WOODS

What’s going to happen in the
YMCA at Davidson this year? Here
are just a few of the things that’ll
happen the first part of the year.

At the first membership meet-
ing which will be held on October
4, there will be a speaker who is
well known and much loved in this
section of the country. This man is
Dr. Harry Moffett from the First
Presbyterian Church in Gastonia.
Dr. Moffett was raised here in
Davidson and went to college here.
He is still remembered by the men
who knew him.

Fall Services are next. The
speaker this fall is Dr. Paul Tudor
Jones. The Services run from
October 9 through October 11. Dr.
Jones is well known in the church
at large. He was at Grace Covenant
Presbyterian Church in Richmond
and now is at Idlewild Presbyterian
Church in Memphis. He received
his Bachelor of Divinity from
Union Seminary in Richmond and
his Doctor of Philosophy from
Union Seminary in New York.

The next speaker is a real treat
for us. The man is Nicholas
Goncharoff, a Russian. He is
speaking at the membership meet-
ing on November 8. Goncharoff
has led quite an exciting life. In
World War. 1 he was a Soviet tank
commander, was captured by the
Germans, and later set free by
the Americans. He is now work-
ing with the International YMCA,
studying Communist tactics and
making talks around the country.
We will certainly look forward to
having an ex-tank commander talk
with us.

Finally there is a special series
which will be directed by Seward
Hiltner. He is the author of Sex
Ethics and the Kinsey Report and
will be discussing “Sex Ethics To-
day” with us. Ho is the associate
professor of Pastoral Theology on
the Federated Theological Faculty
at the University of Chicago. Cer-
tainly he is well qualified to talk
on the subject at hand.

That's only part of what’s been
planned; there are many other
things that will be happening in
the “Y” this year, too. You'll hear

ball, handball, softball, and golf.| about them as school goes on.
