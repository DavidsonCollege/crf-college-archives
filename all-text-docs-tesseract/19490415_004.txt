they prove that. he is carrying on
the old Glenn Miller tradition of
giving the public the best in sweet
and ,the best in swing as well,
something which only Miller was
able to do successfully ‘throughout
the years.

Bandleader Benéke has played
the saxophone ror over 4,000
dances and shows, has played over
100,000 songs, and sung = more
than 30,000 choruses. Over 10 mil-
lion Beneke records have been
sold—not ‘counting those made
with Glenn Miller—and it would

take more than 60 years to play
them all if you spun nothing but
Beneke records twenty-four hours
a day. And at the end of that time

the needle would have traveled

the distance to the moon and

back. ‘
Beneke’s own vocals figure

prominently in the bands success.
Tex’s career as a vocalist began
when Glenn Miller heard him sing-
ing “Ida” to keep himself awake
while driving at night. In spite of

the fact that his recording of
“Chattanooga Choo Choo" holds
an all-time over-the-counter sales

figure of over 1,500,000 copies, he
still insists he cannot sing.

The success of Tex Beneke's or-
chestra is due to the fact that Tex
follows the’ Glenn Miller formila
of playing sweet ballads, in a sweet
manner and keeping his swing as
progressive possible without
losing his melody line—but melody
is all important.

With the band will appear one
of the smartest quartets in the land.
