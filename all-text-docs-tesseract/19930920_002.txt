PiIKA ready to get back to basics

By Mandy Curtis

The Pi Kappa Alpha house at
Davidson reopens this week after
having been closed due to repairs.
The PiKA house was closed by the
physical plant at the college forthe
first three weeks of school.

According to Patterson Court
Advisor Kurt Holmes, the PiKA
house was shut down due to a
series of repairs that needed to be
done after an “accumulative effect
of damages over the last year.”
Because PiKA tends to have many
parties throughout the year, there
are more damages that require regu-
lar maintenance.

The house was not on social
probation, as many people mistak-
enly assumed. According to
Holmes, closing the house was a
way the administration felt would
deter the situation from happening
again. Dean Terry notified PiKA

president Ryan Harper and trea-
surer Jason Bradley that the house
would be closed at the beginning
of school in the first week of Au-
gust. However, Terry did give the
PiKA’s the chance toremedy many
of the problems themselves.

Before classes began, broth-
ers of the house worked summer
nights and weekends doing vari-
ous work on the house.

Among the members helping
the physical plant was coordinator
Braulio Lopez who did much of
the work.

According to Holmes, the
PiKA guys have been very respon-
sible in their response to the prob-
lems; they have been prompt in
paying for much of the repairs, as
well as pitching in to doa lot of the
work.

Amongthe repairs that needed
to be done to the house were re-

painting the walls and putting down
new tiling.

Thebrothers painted the lower
portion of the walls in a combina-
tion of garnet and gold coloring,
giving the house a more personal
touch, according to Holmes. “The
building means something now, “
says Holmes.

Harper says that a lot of posi-
tive energy has come out of the
situation. “It was good for the
house; we needed to wake some of
us up and change our general atti-
tude towards the house and the
campus,” says Harper.

Since the PiKAs have been
out of their house, they have been
eating in the Commons and, justin
the last week, at Warner Hall.
According to Harper, this proves
that there is a lot of cohesiveness
on the court between the fraterni-
ties and-eating houses.

The PiKA house has been closed, but with a lot of work and
money, the brothers will begin eating there again soon.

PiKAs national charter re-
cently reviewed the house, and gave
the organization better ratings than
has been given to Davidson’s PiKA
house in the past 25 years, accord-
ing to Harper.

The guys have set up commit-

tees and will be doing more com-
munity service this year. Harper
says that they are very “enthusias-
tic.”

The PiKAs will be eating in
their house this week and plan to
have a party this weekend.

Thomas Schoenbaum aims to clear up popular misconceptions
Speaker discusses Japanese-U.S. economic, political relations

Thomas Schoenbaum, Executive Director of the University of
Georgia Law School's Dean Rusk center, spoke in the 900 Room
Tuesday night. He emphasized the need for cooperation and a
healthy competeive spirit between the U.S. and Japan.

On September 14, the Dean
Rusk program sponsored a talk on
Japan-United States relations by
Thomas Schoenbaum. The intent
of the talk was to educate the audi-
ence and clear upsome of the gen-
eral misconceptions about politi-
cal and economic relations that
exist in the minds of many people.

Schoenbaum is the executive
director of the Rusk Center at the
School of Law atthe University of
Georgia. This center is the only
other Rusk program in the U.S.
besides Davidson College. He has

spent time in Japan and through his

work in the legal field has been
kept informed on United States-
Japan economic relations.

Schoenbaum emphasized that
the United States and Japan must
work together on apermanentjoint
commission to resolve disputes to
improve the economic relations
between the two countries.

Ever since the early 1980s the
United States’ trade deficit has
grown significantly with Japan.
Most people see Japan asthe U.S.’s
biggest enemy in the world today,
according to Schoenbaum. He
described a “Mercantile Predator
State” to express the feelings of
these people. These same people

son Court symbolizes “the official
kick off to rush,” explains Petty.

Dean Terry feels that the ex-
citement of the freshmen’s pres-
ence on the Court will not encom-
pass any problems because “the
court is so boring...There is the
same format for every party and
play has become work,” Terry ex-
plains. He expresses that there has
been no momentum build up for
this particular weekend and there-
fore there is really nothing to worry
about.

However, hall counselors and
freshmen take a different stand.
Hall counselor, Christy Rikard,
says that, “this past week my girls
have been bored and they are ready
and excited to see what Patterson

Court is all about.” She and hall
counselor John Philpott agree that
the three weeks the freshmen have
had to wait have been helpful.

“This policy has allowed my
guys to get to know their hall and
form acommon community where
everybody is experiencing the same
thing,” Philpott remarks. Rikard
comments that this policy allowed
the girls to realize there are other
activities on campus besides
Patterson Court.

Freshman Geoff Eloge ex-
presseshis excitement for firstnight
down: “I am tired of the dorm
room social situation and ready to
meet and socialize with upperclass-
men.” Freshman Jay Parkinson
agrees with Eloge, “This freshmen
scene has just gotten old.”

Before the freshmen plunged

onto Patterson Court at 9:00 p.m.
the Union’s Freshmen-crew and
Intimate Performances sponsored
a Reggae Fest featuring “Swan-
the-ology” behind Vail Commons.
Freshmen gathered to hear the
reggae band and eat free food be-
fore venturing into “the mystic
unknown,” as John Philpott de-
scribed the freshmen perspective
of Patterson Court.

feel that Japan is very different in
the way they conduct their busi-
ness,

Japan is the United States’
largest overseas business partner
and is important for the economic
structure ofthe United States. Thus,
viewing Japan as an enemy is inac-
curate, according to Schoenbaum.

The joint commission will
serve the purpose of dealing with
problems as they arise and not al-
lowing the two countries to be-
come polarized. Schoenbaum
hopes that Americans will realize
that the trade deficit does not mean
as much as we think in the scale of
world economics.

The United States should hus-

band and cherish the Japanese re-
lationship according’ to
Schoenbaum. The competition that
the Japanese provide is essential to
keep American manufacturers hon-
est. In the early eighties, the U.S.
government limited the number of
Japanese imports.

The United States and Japan
have met often in the last decade to
try tocorrect the problems between
the countries.

Each time. an agreement is
reached, but the effects have been
very limited.

The agreements resolve the
small problems and do not touch
on the big ones, according to
Schoenbaum.
