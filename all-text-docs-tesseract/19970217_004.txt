THE DAVIDSONIAN

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1997

After one year of keeping
their store open late, Cosmic Cof-
fee owners Ed and Nancy Gray
have shortened their hours.

They would like to keep it
open later, but it simply wouldn’t
be profitable for them. “Business
was slow from 3 p.m. -9 p.m.,”
she says, “and if we got any busi-
ness at night it was from 9 p.m. -
10 p.m. It costs us $25 an hour per
person working the counter, so
we would have to get $300 busi-
ness in that one hour [to make
ends meet]. Some stores on Main
Street can make one sale and their
whole day is profitable. Our aver-
age sale is $1.87.”

The Grays have shortened
their hours to 7:30 a:m.-5 p.m.,
six days a week. Since this hap-
pened, they have seen a rise in
business. “We have seen more
students during the daylighthours,
and we have always had support
from faculty and staff,” she says.
We getclasses in here sometimes.
I think that’s good — it bridges the

gap of the unknown. If you can get
them to come once, hopefully they
will come again.”

However, she finds that a small
percentage of transactions each day
are made by students. “We average
15 students a day. That is about 1%
of the school.”

She feels that a negative re-
view that appeared in The
Davidsonian during their first month
of business was a determining fac-
torin student business. “I was naive
enough to think that this was just
one person’s opinion, but it really
hurt us.

we don’t

she says.
She . de-
fends her
choice not
to allow smoking because she says
the smoke would adversely affect
the coffee beans. “We are not a
bar,” she says. Aside from that point,
she is willing to meet with students

getting
a group
together with the Dean of Stu-
dents office. “Town people asked
us fora beer and wine license and
earlier hours. It took us a while,
but we finally got them.”

She and her husband opened
Cosmic Coffee after seeing a stu-
dent survey that unanimously
called for a coffee shop. “When
we opened the coffee house we
thought it would be good for stu-
dents. But we should have done
our homework. I was very sur-
prised at how few students come
here.”

Gray says that the shop has
been doing better in recent weeks,
but hopes that Davidson students
will become more of her business
base. “It’s a symbiotic thing. I’m
not angry, but frustrated. If not a
coffee house, then what? We
won’t close if we get business. I
don’t know what tomorrow will
bring, but it does take business to
stay open.”

Stopping junk mail

EAC leads attack on unsolicited mailings

By NARESH NAGELLA
News Editor

Most of the junk mail that stu-
dents receive will now stop taking
up space in their post offices boxes.

The Environmental Action
Committee (EAC) in an effort to
recycle unwanted trash at the post
office, has obtained cards from the
Mail Preference Service in which
students can request to delete their
names fromthe mailing lists of many
solicitors.

The effort came about in an
effort by the committee to put the
familiar recycling bins, seen every-
where else on campus, in the post
office.

But contractual problems did
not allow for the bins to be placed,

The hauling company that takes
care of recycled materials on cam-
pus was not obliged to do the same
for the post office.

Now, the plan is to “stop the
junk mail before it becomes an is-
sue,” according to Meredith Judy,
head of the EAC.

Junior David Jackson is happy
about the new option.

Each U. S. household usually,
averages 80 pounds of junk mail 4
year. Almost every bit is easily re;

So far 350 students have filled
out the cards that were offered.

Still, Judy warns, the system ig
not perfect:

She says, “It will only elimi,

still important to recycle.”

t the permit; Morrison, Howie,

d Mittelman voted to deny the
rmit.

In order to win approval for a
special use permit, fourcriteria must
be met: .

1. “The use will not materially
pndanger the public health or
safety.”
2. “The use meets all required
-onditions and specifications.”
3. “The use will not substan-
tially injure the value of adjoining
pr abutting property.”
4. “The location and character
pf the use, if developed according
o the plan...will be in harmony
ith the area.”
he debate

During a meeting of the Board,
oncerned parties are invited to of-
er their opinions on the proposed

rmit. Collinsrepresented the Col-
ege, because he was most familiar

ith the technical alterations made
to the house which other town ordi-
nances had required, such as the
Fonversion of a partial bath into a
full one. Several town residents,
both the owners of property adja-
cent to 507 Concord and owners of
property next to College-owned
property, testified at the meeting.

According to the meeting min-
utes, Director of Development for
the College Kevin McCarthy of 520
Concord Road and Ann Conger also
pf Concord Road, both owners of
properties adjacent to 507 Concord
Road, spoke in opposition to the
Bpecial use permit.
Other members of the commu-
nity voiced concerns about the Col-
lege moving students off-campus
d into the community, but the
eeting minutes do not recognize

any of them as being opposed to the
permit.

Their concerns focused on the
precedent granting the permit b y
the Board would set and the possi-
bility that the College would move
more students into College-owned
houses throughout town.

(The meeting minutes, com-
piled by Keane, paraphrase the state-
ments of those who testify. How-
ever, all quotations in this article

reflect the exact contents of the ©

meeting minutes.)

According to the minutes,
McCarthy “was sworn in to speak
in opposition to the special use per-
mit.” He pointed out that by mov-
ing eight students into the house
before having permission to do so
“the college was making the re-
quest after-the-fact.”

“Mr. McCarthy was concerned
that approval of this special use
permit would set a negative prece-
dent. He stated that the college
owns houses throughout Davidson
and may inthe future want to house
other students off-campus,” accord-
ing to the minutes.

McCarthy expressed his belief

that students could disrupt the quiet
nature of Concord Road in the eve-
nings. The minutes state that
McCarthy thought the presence of
eight students would alter the “char-
acter of the street.”

According to the minutes, “Mr.
McCarthy said that the college
should not be treated differently
than any other property owner in
Town. Ordinances should apply to
the college as they do to other resi-
dents.”

In two interviews, McCarthy
stated that he was not against the
students being allowed to stay for
the semester. “I don’t have any
problem with a four month stay,” he
says. “I think they should have
been allowed to stay.”

McCarthy says that each per-

son at the meeting was polled about
whether the permit should be
granted, and, McCarthy states, ev-

eryone including himself was for.

the permit. “I was not opposed to

_ the waiver, and I-went on record as

saying that,” McCarthy says.

McCarthy thinks the College
handicapped its proposal by request-
ing the special use permit after the
students were moved in. “When
you go to the Board after the fact,
that doesn’t look right,” he says.

He also wonders why other ad-
ministrators did not testify. Three
members from RLO, Assistant Di-
rector of Residence Life Beth Bell
Searcy, Residence Life Coordina-
tor Vicki Stellcup, and Facilities
and Housing Operations Coordina-
tor Debby Young, were all present
but did not get sworn in to testify.

According to McCarthy, they
had ample opportunity to do so. He
also thinks that they may have been
able to provide information the
Board requested with which Collins
is not familiar. Holmes was out of
town for the hearing.

Conger, according to the min-
utes, “was sworn in to speak in
opposition to the special use per-
mit.” The minutes note her con-
cerns as traffic, noise, and a poten-
tial for the devaluation of surround-
ing properties. Conger stressed in a
telephone interview that her oppo-
sition was “nothing personal against
the students.” She feared that grant-
ing the permit would establish a
“precedent” of the College moving
students into the community. “The
College should have notified the
residents and gotten permission
first,” she says.

Ward did note that McCarthy
and Conger made the “most objec-
tions” to granting the permit. Collins
and Keane also stated that these two
residents were against the granting
of the permit.

said in a phone
interview thatthe
testimony of
McCarthy and
Conger heavily
influenced his
decision. “My
first concern is

use.... If people

cerned, lam very

he says.

According to the minutes,
Howie also thought that not all of
the criteria for granting the permit
were met. Specifically, the minutes
state that he did not think “points
number 1, 3, and 4” had been satis-
fied.

Ward, on the other hand, was
not disturbed by the College’s ap-
plication. “It’s not uncalled for in
this situation,” he said in a phone
interview.

Ward dismissed the notion that
granting the permit would set a pre-
cedent. At the meeting during the
Deliberation phase of the proce-
dure, the minutes note him express-
ing that “precedence is irrelevant.
If the College returns later for an-
other special use permit at this loca-
tion or any other location, the Board
of Adjustment would be able to
deny that request if the circum-
stances and facts warrant.”

Inaphone interview Ward said,
“IT knew the College had done this in
tight spots before, and it did not
continue.... I don’t think this is a
trend. I don’t think there was a
better place to house the students.”

The miscalculations
- Holmes and Collins both ac-+
knowledge that they should have
spoken to more adjacent property,
owners before the students moved
in.
“Our mistakes were not talking
toall those neighbors,” Holmes says
“But I don’t know if that would
have changed anything.”
Collins confirms that Town
Administrator Leamon Brice sug;
gested to. him that the College anj
nounce to the neighbors that stu
dénts would be moving in before
January 13. However, Colling
feared that “door-knocking” would
“incite” the neighbors against the
permit. “Some folks don’t like to be
bothered,” he says.

Holmes spoke only with
Women’s basketball coach Jo!
Filar and his wife, Kay, who ive a
515 Concord Road.

Filar says that he “appreciated
being informed.” He was com4
forted to know that there would bd
an RA in the house and that thd
students would have to follow Col+
lege housing regulations.
