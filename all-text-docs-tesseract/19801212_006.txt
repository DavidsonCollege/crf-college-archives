6—The Davidsonian— December 12, 1980

It's for the kids, but Davidson actors like becoming animals anyway

Acting is hard work. Con-
vincing an audience you’re a 75-
year old man, for example,
is pretty tough for a robust
college student. It’s even harder
when you're playing an animal.

As Joyce Robinson complain-
ed, ‘“‘It isn’t easy being a
sheep.”

Robinson will in fact play a
sheep in the upcoming. student
production of the children’s one-
act. play “‘Aesop’s Fallables.”
I asked: her and two other cast
‘members why they have elect-
ed: to spend their time playing
sheep and other animals.

Robinson says she’s in a one-
‘act play because she doesn’t
have time for a five-act play.
The major plays require many
hours of rehersal time over sev-
eral weeks. One-acts take only
two to three weeks to mature.
At the same time, the one-
acts provide the same intensity,
concentration and dramatic
quality as a larger show, Robin-
son said.

Robinson plays one of the
sheep in the collection of fable
characters. The difficulty, she

‘says, is creating a believable
character. ‘“‘Sometimes I have
doubts about whatever talent I
may have...I think I’m lacking,
but I like trying....It isn’t easy
being a sheep.”’

I asked Joyce what she liked
best about being in plays, and
she said, ‘The excitement of
working to produce something
that other people can see before
them and enjoy them is what I
like.”’

‘Robinson said it sometimes
bothers her that she never gets

to see her performance. “I'd like
to experience the other side,”

she said.

When I asked her what she
thought of playing to an aud-
ience of children, Robinson said
she thought they would be a
tough group. ‘‘Children need
action and a feeling of partic-
ipation to keep their attention.
Also, the characters will need to
be a little more animated’’
than if were they playing to an
adult audience.

What do you need to be
able to try out for a play and
then hopefully perform in one?
“You need to be willing to make
a fool of yourself,’’ Robinson

said. ‘‘You don’t go out there
anticipating that, or wantin to
mess up, but you have to be
willing to take that chance and
goon.” :

Neil Sondov plays the wolf in ©

“Aesop’s Fallables’’ and says
that he’s in the play mainly
because he has always had an
interest in drama, even though
he has not been in a play for
a couple of years..

“I like the idea of trying to
entertain people,” Sondov said,
“especially children. They have
very vivid imaginations and not
much experience with the ‘real’
world.” Sondov chose a one-
act play so he could gradually
work back into the rhythm of
dramatics. Sometimes it can be
easier to work with a student
director, Sondov said).

Why did you try‘out for this
play? ‘‘Everybody has different
ways of expressing himself,’’
Sondov said. ‘‘It’s just a case of
‘different strokes for different
folks,’ I think. Personally, I like
being in plays because it’s fun.
If it weren’t fun, I wouldn’t
do it.”’

‘““At the end of the play
I'd like to feel relief! Hopefully,

I'll feel we did entertain the
audience. I’d like to see the
children smile and laugh. That’s
the most important thing,’’
Sondoy said.

John Boswell has been in
major productions at Davidson,
but this is his first one-act play.
The shortened time needed for a
one-act play helped Boswell de-
cide to try out, as it did for
Sondov and Robinson. More
than that, Boswell says he likes
“to meet new people and work
with new people: I get a lot
of fun out of doing something
with others.”

Boswell says he isn’t sure of
his musical talents. He thinks
he can hide in the sound of
those ‘‘better voices.’’ ‘‘The
songs aren’t like Rodgers and
Hammerstein’s. Everyone does
not know these songs, so that
may help.”’

How does the audience affect
your character? ‘‘I’m not sure
at this point. I look to Jack
(Hall-the production director)
to help me there; I guess I
don’t want my character to be
too subtle. But then a mod
mouse is kind of off the wall!”’

Boswell said, ‘‘I try to put
myself in the character’s shoes
and then look at the other char-
acters through his eyes. But
you've also got to go with what
sounds good in rehersal, just
trying him out in different

ways.’

Team work is one of the most
important ideas. College actors
have to be able to work with
one another, ‘‘to negotiate,
cooperate, or give up something
you might want for the sake of
the show,’’ Boswell said.

All three had different reas-
ons for trying out for the show.
Robinson liked the personal
challenges of doing a rock
musical for children. Sondov
liked the idea of getting back
into drama and entertaining
people. Robinson wanted the
experience of doing a one-act
play and meeting new people.
But the difference between aud-
itions and opening night is a big
one. As Boswell says, ‘“‘Open-
ing night you have something
to work with. In auditions it’s
just you,’’ and an empty
auditorium.

The drama workshop has

Saw’’(mini-major production)
