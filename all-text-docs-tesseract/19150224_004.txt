iterature in the library
upon the two queries has been transmit-
ted by the members of the two teams to
their respective headquarters, and from
now until the time that the contests are
held, April 5, the four debaters are go-
ing to make a united effort to land a
victory for Davidson in both of the
forensic battles.

This is the first time that Davidson
has ever debated either Emory or Clem-
son, and hence there is no means of com
paring the relative streneth of David-
son's teams with that of their opponents.
Suffice it to sav, however, that Davidson
is taking nothing for granted, and no
stone will be left unturned in the way

of preparation.

MEETING OF THE
BLUF PENCIT CLUB

At the regular meeting of the Blue
Pencil Club, held a few davs ago, many
new plans and ideas for the club were
discussed. It is expected that, together
with other matters, the questions rela-
tive to the different publications will be
one over, and it will act as a clearing
Rouse for some of these plans, as all: of
the different publications are represented.

The special subject for discussion was
the work of Kipling, and Kipling as a
mar.

Sandwiches and other things of simi-
lar nature were served, forming a most
important part of the evening's program.

DAVIDSON STUDENTS
ATTEND CONVENTION

The campus was deserted on Wedunes-
day and the town alse. Practically the
whole student body was in Charlotte at
tending the sessions that day of the Lay-
men’s Convention. A large number re-
turned that night on the special train at
1 o'clock. Others who had gone the
first part of the week and many who had
deft the -college Wednesday morning
stayed through the rest of the conven
tion.

The student hody assembled at the
Second Presbyterian church on Wednes-
day morning and marched to the Con-
vention hall in a body, sitting in a re-
served section of the balcony.

College work was not successfully re-
sumed till Saturday. But every man
who attended felt that he had received
a great help and inspiration from the
great meetings of the Convention and
the wonderful addresses of Mott. Speer
and others. (

L. H. SMITH PRESIDENT
OF THE EASLEY BANK

Loyd H. Smith, class of ‘12, was re-
cently elected President of the. Easley
Loan & Trust Co., of Easley, S. C.
filling the vacancy caused by the recent
death of his father. This is quite an
honor to be conferred upon such a young
man, but with the excellent qualities
which he has heretofer exhibited. his
friends are assured of his continued
success.

While in college Mr. Smith was
President of the Student Body and a
member of the debating team.

SPRING GOLF TOURNAMENT.

Arrangements are now being made
for the Spring golf tournament that was
postponed on account of recent bad
weather. Ten qualifying rounds will be
played by each competitor in order to
determine the handicap. The member-
ship of the club has increased consider-
ably this spring, and there will be many
participants for the championship.

Three new holes are being laid off on
the links, which will add greatly to the
appearance, and will also leave two holes
for beginners to practice on. The mem-
ernie fee for the spring term will be

3-00.

SADLER WINS IN
STATE PEACE CONTEST

The State Peace Contest was held in
Raleigh last Friday. ‘There were rep-
resentatives from nine colleges of the
State. Davidson was represented — by
Norman Johnson. ‘The contest started
at 8 o'clock Friday night, at Meredith
College, where was present an audience
of about five hundred people. The
Davidson representative had the misfor-
tune and handicap of drawing the place
of first speaker, while there was great
disturbance caused by people coming in.
The judges were residents of Raleigh.
After much deliberation they gave first
place to Sadler, of Atlantic Christian
College, and second to the representative
of Wake Forest.

“Tis not failure not to win, but not
to try.”

ANNUAL NEARING
COMPLETION

Judging from the optimistic statement
of the Editor-in-chief that he can almost
see daylight ahead, the Annual must in-
deed be nearing, completion. “Vhe ar-
rangement of all its details. has been
finally decided on and the dummy has
been returned to the publishers. Prac
tically all of the art work has been in-
spected by the faculty, and a good part
of it has been sent off. “The art. staff,
however, has had an unusually difficult
task this year, and there is a little work
vet to come in. ‘The greater part of
the written articles have been reviewed
by the faculty and sent.to the press. It
is confidently expected by the editor that
the last of the Annual will have been
sent off by Saturday. In the meanwhile
“Mac” and “Enoch” are tapidly recov-
ering from their arduous duties while
basking in the sunny smiles of fair col-
lege maidens.

Into the dining room of Stonewall
Hotel_bustled the Man From the City,
the Man of Business, “Shorty” Wil-
liams. ‘Three friends were with him,
and obediently they waited for a word
of experience and wisdom from him as
to the best method of getting a good
supper.

“ach man order him one dish, and
we will have a plenty of four things
for all of us.” said the Man of Business,
and there was instant and happy acquies-
cence,

“Shorty” ordered a meat, another po-
tatoes, and another a dish of peas. The
waiter hurried the order and the four
friends jovously ‘fell to.”

But alas the bill came, too. “Shorty”
gazed. Seventy-five cents for his dish of
meat. Friend One gazed. Seventy-five
cents for potatoes. Friend two likewise.
Seventy-five cents for a little plate of
green peas.

“American plan,” and the
bowed away.

“A dish of peas when I could have
gotten a whole supper for the same
price,” came a groan.

The Man of Business has been singu-
larly quiet lately.
