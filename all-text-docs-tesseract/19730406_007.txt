As Old-Time Blues Performer

“He as the kindest) human
being. without) exception.”
declared Susie Summers.
speaking of the Umon’s gentle
custodian.

Well-liked by all who meet
him, perhaps not many of the
students know that Fred Deese
Was once u blues singer. Char-
med by his mellow singing as he
works, however, the listener
soon finds out.

He takes his lunch hour in the
Union reading room, square
capable hands twisting a phant
rubber band. Fred Deese has an
excellent memory —distant
dates tumble out easily. The
rubber band snaps as he begins
to speak.

“ve lived in Davidson 32
years. Iwas raised on a farm in
Monroe. We'd get 50 cents for
12-14 hours of work. The band
was the only way to earn spen-
ding money.

“How it got started, I was
working for some people, and
their son was a guitar-picker.
Once I was out working and
humming, and he came up and
said, ‘Fred, I didn’t know you
could sing.”

“IT told him IT couldn't.”
laughs Deese in reminiscing,
“just in my own way. I
remember that as wel! as
if it were yesterday, and it was
35 years ago.”

His employer's son reminded
him that it would be a good way
to earn extra money. Deese was
dubious, and said that he didn’t
think anyone would pay to hear
him sing. Nevertheless. he
decided to give it a go.

“It took a month to get the
boys together good enough to
play at a dance. The first time
that we sung we didn't have
money enough for a guitar, so
we only had a flute and a wash-
board.

“We were paid $4 because we
didn’t have a guitar. We saved
it, and the four of us earned

another $3. and went out and
bought a guitar for $7

“The second time we had a
gullar, so we got $5. We'd sing
from 8 p.m. until 12. and yet $5
for four—a $1.25 apiece.

“Money wasn’t then like it ts
now, you could do gracious with
$1.25. We'd play the same
amount of time for coloreds for
$2. From ‘34 to “36 we earned $7.
from °36 to “39 we made $15." he
said.

“Wed play at the County
Frolics.. They had step and
buck dancing. and the two-step
and the Charleston. I would
have been a good dancer. but I
Was raised that it was a sin. I
Was raised that the bad man
would get you if you danced.

“Anyway, we didn't have any
Way to ride, so we'd walk eight
to ten miles while carrying our
instruments to play. There was
only a washboard, flute and
guitar.

“When we'd sing there'd be
roads of people, roads of them
coming to hear us sing. There'd
be roads of them as_ there
wasn't a way to get a ride.”

AN OPINION
Citizen

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Staff Writer

“Citizen, you have been ac-
cused of aiding and abetting the
rise of tyranny, caprice, and
autocracy in this fair land. How
do you plead?”

**Not guilty, Your Honor.”

“Citizen, on November 7 of
last year did you not enter an
electoral polling place for the
purpose of voting in favor of
Republican electors pledged to
support Richard Milhous Nixon
for the Presidency?”

I did so enter that place, Mr.
Prosecutor.”

And did you, further, so vote
for those electors?”

... Arrogance Infected

given an hour-long address, building to an emotional climax, com-
plete with lectern pounding and ending with the shout, “Victor
Hugo est le plus grand poete de la France!’’ To this Sartre was sup-
posed to have replied with wui.. vu vesignation, “Oui, monsier,
vous avez raison. Victor Hugo est le plus grand poete de la Fran-
ce...Helas!”’

The professor could say very very well that the student body of
Davidson is ‘the best in the South,” “the cream of the crop,’’ to
which he might add, like Sartre, ‘‘Helas!” If this be cream, spare
us please the curds and whey! But, indeed, we have been spared the
curds and whey and the schmierkase to boot! The student here is,
in truth, academically excellent, if not sartorially and morally So.
The Admissions Office proclaims the first fact, visual cognition
proves the second and student behavior, in and out of class,

- suggests the third. ;

Now, having said this in rotund terms, he proceeded to qualify

these observations so as not to apotheosize the student
academically nor to damn him morally. As for his sartorial state:
che sera, sera. ;

Academically and morally of what type student did the professor
most disapprove? He went down his list. Was it the athlete whose
only reason for being at Davidson was his proficiency at throwing a
rubber ball through a metal hoop? No! Was it the newly arrived co-
eds? Certainly not! The fruit of paradise was so new at the school
he had not had the time to appraise it, let alone taste it
(academically, of course). Was it the not-too-discreet acid-head
who, in class, nodded like a breeze-blown flower, like, perhaps, the
very source of his own inebriation? No! Was it the squeeky-voiced,
pimply-faced effeminate, one who always had the correct answer
to his most well planned, devious, questions? Frustrating as he
may be, the professor could not really disapprove of him either. Af:
ter all, academic excellence is what he is being paid to seek and he
had to take it where he found it. ;

Suddenly he hit upon it! The one type he most disapproved of in
the student body. Disapproved of? Despised! It was the student
who did not know something—some discipline, some art, and who
was grinningly proud of the fact that he did not know it. This was
the intolerable one. What single adjective could he apply to such a
student? The professor. thought a while. Proud? Conceited? No.
There really was only one word. A shudder ran down his back as he
penned it to end his column: *‘Arogant.”’

Deese recounted

Deese has sung in the Union
betore. Asonyg whichhe made up
about the Depression was per-
formed then, along with some
"30's blues

Asked for a sample of his
blues singing. Deese strokes his
grizzied head, and explains that
because of smoking. his voice
isn't hike iw was in the “30's. but
he'll sing. anyway.

Deese tells of the guitar
plucking that should ac-
company the song. None bemg

heavy, slow stomping. The
Ives come out in a mellow
voice. .

With a sigh, Deese looks up.
“Well, I guess that’s about the
end. Times now aren't like they
used to be.”

Tried For Nixon Vote

“Obiection, Your Honor.”

“Objection overruled. Ans er
the question.”

“TL dia.

“Now, Citizen. As a result of
your vote was not the sovereign-
ty of North Vietnam violated
repeatedly by one of the fiercest
air attacks in the history of
manking in the following
month?"

‘My vote had nothing to do
with those attacks.”

‘Do you presume to tell this
court that had that man not
been overwhelmingly elected
those attacks would have been
staged anyway?”

“I cannot engage’ in
speculation, Mr. Prosecutor.”

“Citizen, do you know what
one Senator of Mr. Nixon's par-
ty said of that move — that Mr.
Nixon seemed to have gone
temporarily mad?”

*Theard the remark.”

“Are you aware that no one
was consulted during that
period of attack who had been
duly elected by the people—that
the People’s Congress was
snubbed and ignored?"

“Twas soaware.”

“Citizen, can you claim
exemption from prosecution for
supporting the rise of a man
who gained his position through
fraud, spying, planted agents,
lies, and politica! espionage?”

“Those charges are un-
founded.”

**How can you claim they are
without foundation when cam-
paign staffers have been con-
victed in court for their part?
When one of those staffers fears
for his safety if he tells the truth?
When that President said
the previous January that he
personally ran his campaigns
and took personal control of
them? When the President's
personal immunity from
testifying to the people's
representatives has been ex-
tended to include his entire staff
for purely political reasons and
not for the national security?”

**Lobject, Your Honor.”

“Objection overruled.”

*‘Do you then deny that you
had any part in the rise of such
a man to such a position? Did
you not become personally
associated with that campaign
by monetary and time com-
mitments?”

“IT workeu vrienty with the
campaign.”

“Do you then deny that you
had any part in the creation of
the present situation of one man
rule, arbitrary impoundments
of allocated funds. and _ in-
timidation against the press?”

“I did not, when I voted, wish
to offer support to such ac-
tivities.”

**But by your vote did you not
give that man such power and
put your implicit trust in him?”

**T suppose I did.”

“Citizen, are you aware that
the President has impounded
funds specifically allocated by
the People’s Congress to aid
those in need. including the
poor, the sick. working
mothers, and students?”

“Tam aware of certain im-
poundments.”"

“Citizen. where is the money
for the December bombing of
North Vietnam to come from?
Was the money for that cam-
paign specifically allocated by
the People’s Congress?

“It was not specifically
allocated to my knowledge. It
will come from general military
funds, I suppose."

“Citizen, have military funds
been impounded?"

**Not to my know ledge."

“Citizen, what gave the
President the right to carry on

that war? Had Congress
declared war?”
“The Gulf of Tonkin

Resolution gave the President
power in place of a declaration
of war."

**Had that resolution not been
repealed?"

“It had. But the President as
Commander-in-Chief had to
give aid to our military men
abroad."

“In January, perhaps. No
troops now remain in Vietnam.
What is your justification for
continued heavy bombing of
Cambodia when the President
continues to tell the people
the war is over?”

“The war must be brought to
anend.”

“But has not the President
himself told the people the war
is over, that we must forget it
(though not forget those who
refused to give themselves for
nothing gained)?”

I believe he has “

“Ah, ha. Can you deny your
part in allowing this farce and
blatant lie to be perpetrated on
the American people?”

“My vote did not cause this. I
did so in good faith. I could not
see the results.”

- “Citizen, are you aware of a
nickname the President has
acquired over the years?”

“I believe so.”

“Would you tell the court,
please. what that nickname
is?”

“Objection, Your Honor.”

“Objection overruled. Tell
the court, Citizen.”

“Tricky Dick.”

“No more questions,
Honor.”

you wish to address the Court?"" |

Citizen, has not denied the act of
voting for Richard Milhous
Nixon and has claimed ignoran-
