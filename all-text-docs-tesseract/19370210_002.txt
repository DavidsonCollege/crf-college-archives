DOC NEWTON ... Is now head of the State
Football Coaching Staff. He has developed
excellent teams out of seemingly poor ma-
terial; he has acted as a necessary drive for
practices, and contests; he has served David-
son College in a laudable manner since his first
introduction to the college campus. So it is
with regrets that we see him ushered into
State College, although we realize the bene-
fits to him are considerably more than could
be offered by Davidson.

COACH GENE McEVER.. . Coach McEver
now pilots the destinies of the football team
for the approaching year. He has served as
an able backfield coach to Doc Newton, and
much of our past successes are due in large
part to his work. In the minds of the students,
he was elevated to’the Head Coach’s position
for Davidson, long before the official an-
nouncement was made.

The Red and Black Masquers are to be com-
mended for setting somewhat of a precedent
in sponsoring the Avon Players in “Merchant
of Venice.” There was but one obstacle to
mar the performance and that was not on the
part of the players, but may be attributed to
a small part of the student audience whose
idea of the behavior of the college man is mis-
interpreted, It is difficult to realize that there
are in our student body, certain persons who
feel that they must express their childish emo-
tions in typical prep-school fashion. It may be
to attend the local movie
house and conduct oyrselves as we please, for

excusable for us
there we embarrass none but ourselves.
at a stage production, where both the players
and the visitors are to be considered, cer-
tainly we should draw the line.

Also it can be noticed at the basketball
games and near the dormitories upon the ap-
pearance of the young ladies where the same
childish attitude sometimes regrettably pre-
vails. We never realize what embarrassment
we cause the recipierts of these “cat-calls”
until we ourselves are placed in a similar
position,

We've come a long way in the improvement
of our conditions on our campus and if we can
erase this undesirable obstacle it can be truly
said that we do live up to our tradition as
Davidson gentlemen.

| Cataous Comments

When The Davidsonian reporter suddenly
raps at your door and wants to know if the
proverbial Campus Comments are ready to be
edited before printing, you all at once recall
that you're without a subject. Then
you ask several friends for suggestions you
get no definite answer other than the standard
conception of what any campus commentator

when

might be expected to decipher from any well-
balanced college community—“Whatever it is
tear ‘em apart.” Don’t get the idea that at last
there has arrived one of those spineless won-
ders who can’t work up a good case of en-
thusiasm over a pet peeve and ring down a
sonorous Hail Columbia for the benefit of any
who might second the motion. Subjects which
range from the boarding houses to Senior
church seats usually furnish the best oil for
glib-tofgued sycophants who can well .af-
ford to write without fear of contradiction, at
least from students. The more gentle disser-
tations’on campus life which fill the bill from
being nice to freshmen to the budding rumor
rage may come closer to arousing the huzzas
of alumni and others but ledve much to be said
or unsaid where the rose blooms freshest.

Excuse me, therefore, if I indulge in a bit of
heresy and cross the fence by resorting to
making personal observations, for what gets
everybody’s gladhand and calls only for ver-
bal bouquets is the well-washed and ever-
No student,
prof., old grad, or friend gets any further than
dubbing that intangible glow as a “certain
something” and admitting that it just is and
that there’s no argument about it. So the man
who attempts to explain it gets little further
than the fact itself that it’s ineffable. Better
still, then, might be the plan of endeavoring
to trace at least one source of the whole.

During the exam periods such as the one we
just passed through school is out except for
toeing the mark whenever the tests come
along. To the lower three classes, therefore,
the practice of attending chapel is simply an
institution which keeps on after classes leave
off. It’s a Senior privilege (well founded),
that they be,excused from those exercises—
and undoubtedly rightfully enough. But that
fact furnishes the illustration I feel called on
to make, for it séems to me that I lost contact
with the school for those two weeks. It makes
little difference if I did except to realize that
if it weren’t for chapel, during the regular
term, with its organ selection, its hymn, its
moment of prayer, its announcements, its oc-
casional rumble of laughter or whistles, and
the chance to watch the entire student unit
back its every move in daily get-togethers
the Davidson spirit might not have the ‘cause
to run as high as it does. Few if any schools
around us or anywhere follow the same pro-
cedure. For the most part they’re too large
which is not their fault, yet, though they have
the power, all too often they don’t have the
spark which has made us famous. Maybe
then it can be traced in some part to our chapel
every day—at least my vote goes for it there.
Maybe you don’t think so but, anyway, think
it over.

We would like to add our voice
to those regretting the departure
of Coach Newton from Davidson.
He's done a great job while here
and the best wishes of Davidson
men go with him. We are very for-
tunate in having the new regime
under Coaches McEver and Chap-
man and the student body seems

confident of the future.

The Kappa Delta sorority of
Queens gave a delightful party Sat-
urday night at Martha Alexander's

tor, Miss Josephine King, escorted
by Joe. Hunter. The formal Phi
Gams and the S. P. E.’s were there
in a body. Gibb Smith, Johnny
Allen, and Dan Gilliam entertained
extemporaneously over the micro-
phone. The Phi Gams got stuck
in the elevator of the Wilder Build-
ing between their pig dinner and
the party and Hoxie Thompson’s
derby was the sartorial success of
the evening.

Newton left Sunday to take over
his position at State. Monday night
he was introduced to the students
at a huge meeting, presided over
by the president of the student
body. Newton and Bob Warren
will respond to the talks given™by
several alumni and officers of State
College.

Newton could not be _ reached
here since his acceptance of the po-
sition, but he told The Charlotte
Observer that he was hoping to
name a line coach in the next day
or so and that he would like to get
a man familiar with his system so
that he could start spring practice
at once. Chet Chapman, third as-
sistant and line coach at Davidson
was offered the job, but ‘he ac-
cepted the position as first assistant
here at Davidson. He also coaches
freshman basketball.

[OPEN FORUM

It’s too bad that the movie in-
dustry works its actresses so hard
because according to letters from
Misses Olivia deHaviland, June
Lang, and Martha Raye they just
won't have time to make the David-
son Mid-Winters. They don’t know
what they’re missing!

Martha Raye’s personal typed
letter to our own inimitable Sam
Ryburn follows:

Dear Mr, Ryburn:

You're a very nice boy to think
of me and you don't know how
much I'd like to be there for your
party, but they keep me so “gol-
derned” busy here in Hollywood
that I gotta say “no.” :

At any rate, I hope you all have
a perfectly glorious time, and if
you do happen to see Bing Crosby’s
newest picture for Paramount
(“Waikiki Wedding”), just remem-
ber that while you were dancing
around having a Centennial I was
being worked to death doing what
you'll be seeing!

And you know what you can tell
” in’ the house, eh?

Best wishes,
(signed) MARTHA RAYE.

Modest JUNE LANG’S letter was
written by hand personally and so
it is best not to reveal her admirer:
My dear Mr.—

I appreciate your kind invitation
to your midwinter dances on Feb-
ruary 12 and 13 more than I can
tell you, and regret that it is not
possible for me to be there.

I am starting another picture
soon, and am so busy in Hollywood
that I rarely get away for a vaca-
tion.

I appreciate your letter and your
invitation.

Apparently Miss deHaviland sent
a “dictated but not read.” “Maybe
she was indisposed at the time,”
says her correspondent. At any
rate, the recipient of her letter was
very. disappointed in the results of
his most gracious epistle requesting
her presence at the Mid-Winter

by it, that when requesting the let-

not find it anywhere.

it used to be, in spite of the low
rate at which power is now avail-

It was also revealed that a re-
cent survey indicated that the stu-
dents averaged using from 75 to 100
gallons of water per man each day.
This consumption of water has re-
sulted in the college paying a water
bill of more than $3,000 a year for
the past five years.

Despite these large increases no
extra charge has been made and
the school has only asked that the
students turn out lights when not
in use and be not wasteful in the
use of water.

It is expected that a more definite
announcement will be made later
upon the question of the damage
deposit. :

I don’t know if you remember it
or not, but in The Davidsonian of
January 13 this column made men-
tion to some extent of a strip in the
Queens Blues which, we thought,
dealt rather loosely with the dig-
nity of Davidson College, and, more
specifically, of this newspaper.
Well, we seem to have let ourselves
in for something. With an eye to
self-betterment, writers for the
Blues seem to make it a habit to
read The Davidsonian, with the re-
sult that Ima Heart-healer, who
conducts the column which came up

for discussion here, saw our com-
ments and let us have it right be-
tween the eyes for certain remarks
therein contained,

The following epistle came right
in the midst of the exam period,
with the result that Kernel came
through with some grades a hotten-
tot wouldnt have (punctuation and
other mistakes Ima’s):

SOK
“My dear Mr. Fant:

“In the last issue of The David-
sonian, you used some extracts from
my column in your ‘Davidson in a
Nutshell.’ Your comments on this
column were somewhat unbecoming
to a little Presbyterian brother (!),
(a relationship which the editorial
staff assumed in the above men-
tioned issue of your paper).

“In my own ‘quaint little way’ as
you so sarcastically put it, I wish
to defend:

“First . .. The Queens Blues
which is no yellow sheet printed
by a green staff. Second...
My own little column, which
was not intended to be used as
a ‘filler’ for your columu in
The Davidsonian.

“If you are still awaiting ‘with
outstretched (!) arms’ the said Al-
gernon whom you wish to add as a
feminine touch to your editorial
staff, I am afraid this will be quite
a blow to your fond hopes .-...
Algernon, Mr. Fant, is a boy’s
(Wow! Sure left myself
wide open for that one!)

“The error which you took such
fiendish delight in pointing out was
a typographical one and beyond our
control.” (Ima used the word “in-
ferior” for “inferiority,” and now
she’s trying to lay it on the printer).
“Our sincere apologies to X. Y.
Z. for any unjust criticism he might
have received for such a mistake.
“Any problems of General In-
terest which you might wish to ad-
dress to this column, Mr. Fant, will
be most welcome.”

“IMA HEARTHEALER.”

Let it be said that the exclamation
marks used above are not Ima’s.
They just crept in at the most
amazing parts of this truly amazing
letter. What'll she think of next!? !

-O-

An untold number of announce-
ments each year begin with the
words: “This student body takes
very good care of college proper-
rty,; BUT ...” If we may so pre-
sume, we wish to turn the tables
here and say, The administration
takes very good care of college
property, BUT there has been about
a foot of paint and plaster missing
between the second and third win-
dows from the front, on your right
as you go into the Auditorium, for
so long that most of us cannot re-
member when this part of the build-
ing was whole. While you're
counting up your Centennial proj-
ects, why not number the eradica-
tion of this blemish among them?

-O-

Stuff: Wonder how a certain
coach will feel when he gets beat
next year by a team he once coach-
ed? ... Hope the Pan-Hellenic has
seen to it that Jan Garber has an
arrangement of “O Davidson” for
the ean ealy ... By the way, if
you don’t gd to the Mid-Winter
dances, you'll be Forgotten Man
Number One (that is, unless you
happen to be on the basketball trip
—to all such, our sympathies) , . .
