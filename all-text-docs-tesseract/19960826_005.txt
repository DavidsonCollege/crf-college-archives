Registrar cites “human error” in schedule mix-up

By Asa HERCULES

Staff Writer

A short time after Fall class
schedules had been mailed home
to students, an enrollment roster
revealed that there were “full”
classes with no students in them —
and many Davidsonians were sur-
prised to find that they were locked
out of their first choice classes.

With a corrected schedule
mailed two weeks later, many stu-
dents began questioning the com-
puterized registration system.

The glitch, according to Reg-
istrar Polly Griffin was due to hu-
man error. In the spring, the ceil-
ings of some classes, including
sections of Organic Chemistry,
were “artificially reduced to test

the CATS Line telephone system,”
said Griffin.

This test allowed the
Registrar’s Office to simulate a
“closed” class, or a class that had
the maximum number of students,
without that class actually being
full.

When it was discovered that
the simulation was never reversed,

94-95 yearbooks in after long delays

By RANDY HARTWELL
Associate News Editor

When 1995 Quips & Cranks
Editor-in-Chief Amy Liz Betz
opens her editorial letter with
“Eventually the age old ‘why me’
question appears in everyone’s
life,’ one has some idea of the
extent of her anguish in producing
a yearbook. After long delays in
publishing, the annual which docu-
ments the 1994-95 school year is
available in the Union.

Betz and other Q & C staffers
blame the unusually long wait on
a lack of committed staff mem-
bers.

“T expected that some people
would flake out because it happens
every year and hey, life goes on,”
Betz writes. “What I soon realized
is that yes, people do drop their
responsibilities at the last minute,
but life goes on for everyone ex-
ceptme.”

Still, Betz is pleased with the

finished product and said that “I’m
really glad it’s done and I think it
turned out really well. What has
made it worthwhile is that I’ve
bumped into people. .. who said it
was well worth the wait and that
they were so excited about it. Just
hearing stuff like that made me
happy and I hope [this edition of Q
& C] encourages freshmen to get
involved.”

But while good things may
come to those who wait, some stu-

yearbooks at freshman registration. — .

New Q&C Editors Kerry Albright and Shelley

dents say the delay makes them
question the wisdom of paying up
front for a yearbook they may not
receive for several years.

Those who have doubts about
the capability of the incoming O &
C staff needn’t worry; co-editors
Shelley Elifson and Kerry Albright
have already sent many page lay-
outs to Quips & Cranks’ publisher,
Wadsworth Publishing, and ex-
pects the 1995-96 yearbook to ar-
rive sometime in November.
