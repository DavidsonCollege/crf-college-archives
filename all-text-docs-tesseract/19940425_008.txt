As the final chords of David

Bowie’s “Changes” float out my
down-the-hill window on the lat-
est in a string of glorious after-
noons, I cannot help but reflect on
the academic year that has (almost)
passed. This was my Sophomore
year; the one during which I de-
clared a major, did my watercredit,
and rushed for my fraternity. Al-
though the momentous and well-
documented changes that have oc-

lesson: truth and honor really are
more important than anything else
in the world. He made me proud to

that maybe we could have been

him the respect of having more
people in attendance—but that’s

night, he sacrificed
some of his time to come and speak
to our student body.

His message was simple but
powerful: “We can all be what we
want to be if we set our mind to it.”
The speech spoke to me, as a stu-
dent trying to figure out what I’m
going to do with the rest of my life.
He spoke of the importance of in-
tegrity and honor. He defined lead-
ership in terms of trust and cour-

Dean Terry for facilitating an en-
vironment that fosters such devel-

mended the students of Davidson
for making the wise decision to
come to such a fine academic insti-
tution. Finally, he repeatedly
thanked us, the college, for invit-
ing him to speak. (Which, inciden-

amazed by the opportunity to be
sitting three rows from a man of
such prestige. I had never been
more impressed with the various
opportunities that Davidson has to
offer. It was one of those moments
where I forgot about stress for a
while and was simply very, very
proud to be a part of the Davidson
experience.

people that you’ re drunk. Hug your friends.
Kiss your parents. Know the rules to at least
twenty drinking games. Say “I love you” to
five people and mean it. Always have a
sober driver.

Get drunk before noon five times. Crash
closed parties. See the sun rise seven times.
Listen to me tell my Boomsday story. Ask
someone out whom you’ ve always wanted
to, even if you’re sure they’Il say no. Go to
twenty concerts. Go to the bathroom in
every stall on campus. Regret doing things,
but don’t wish for them tobe undone. Watch
Mystery Science Theater 3000 after experi-
menting.

Don’t be afraid to vomit. Be interest-
ing, but don’t try too hard. Strive for a type-
B personality.

Most importantly: have fun.

Sorry if that got a bit too Robert
Fulghum-esque. I’m within one month to
graduation, so forgive me if I wax nostalgic
abit. I just want each and every one of you
to be able to look back on your college years
and think happy thoughts. In ten years you
aren’t going to remember that ten-page pa-
per, but you will remember driving to the

grocery store at nine in the morning to get

malt liquor, doing solo naked water slides in
front of fifty SAE’s and their dates, going

out in a dress, or telling some girl just how
attractive you think she is.

Ihad a wonderful year. [had a wonder-
ful college career. I don’t know what the
future holds for me. I don’t even know
where I’m going to be living in a month, but
I’mnot worried. I know that wherever I end.
up, I'll be happy there.

If I get super bored maybe I’ll even
come back here some day and tell you my
life story.

I’ve learned many things over the past
year, some of which are about women. And
if there is one piece of knowledge which I
can share with my male brethren, itis this: if
girls ignore you, if they spit on your face, if
they think you are crude and disgusting, all
hope is not lost.

Do one simple thing and women will
finally say “Hi” to you occasionally and
won’t always resist when you try to engage
them in conversation. My secret? Whine,
whine, whine.

You may not become the most popular
thing on campus, but at least they'll know
who you are. Again, I thank you all for
reading my stuff so loyally. It really makes
me feel good. Your compliments keep me
going. To quote Sally Field, “You like me!
You really like me!” Well, some of you do,
anyway. -

Farewell, Davidson. I’msure you’ ll do
just fine without me.

Chris continued from page 6

male banter abounds, everyone knows that
we are glad.

Girlfriends call, and everyone is glad
for that, too. None of them will come over
either. By now we are drunk, and girl-
friends, like boyfriends, tend to be afraid of
their belligerent partners. After they hang
up, the banter picks up a notch.

It is a scene familiar in the true sense of
the word. We are comfortable because we
are a family. We know everyone's weak-
nesses and, more importantly, strengths. We
know all of our sexual exploits, and to a
greaterdegree, failures. Weknow ourGPAs,
our parents, our sisters and brothers: We
know everything about each other.

And we will part soon. "Cheese" is not
the word for the expression, "but we will
never really be apart." "Velveeta" is the
word. And no one will say anything like
that. But after graduation, we will hug, and
there will be a sense of sadness.

More importantly, there should be a
sense of glory. Glory that, one, some of us
are graduating. (And even more of us may.)
Glory that, two, we are friends. Glory that,
three, we are family.

But that does not matter when Rod runs
back into the bathroom to puke, and Shores
and Freer can't stop laughing. In fact, they
are still laughing at-Dave, who made the

same run a little earlier, right after I made
him drink a Flaming Dr. Pepper.

Some of us are studying, and no one can
understand why. Dorks. Smarter than we
are, but dorks nonetheless. It is something
we have always resisted. And to calm the
fears of our parents, it is not because we
couldn't drink alone-- given the right cir-

‘cumstances, we could. Itis because we don't

want anyone to miss anything. A good story
is always best experienced first-hand.

Especially with a friend. (Velveeta!
Pronounced yoo-RE-kaa!)

So, to my friends in the senior class, I
bid you farewell. I know that I will not be
better off without you. I am, however, better
off because of you.

Yes, Harrison was the naked one, but
Wesley talked him into it.
