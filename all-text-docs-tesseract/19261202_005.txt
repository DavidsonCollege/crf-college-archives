Davidson Alumnus

Delivers Address

Mr. H. S. Richardson, '06, of Greensboro,
one of the donors of Richardson Field and |
Richardson Stadium, is becoming widely
known as a speaker upon taxation and its re-
lationship to business and manufacturing in |
North Carolina. He will speak at Wilming-
ton Thursday night, and an effort is being |
made to have him remain over for the ban- |
quet meeting of the Wilmington Alumni As- |
sociation, which the secretary is to organize
Friday night.

The Wilmington: Star of Sunday, Novem- |
ber 28th, has the following to say in regard |
to Mr. Richardson’s appearance in that city:

“H. S. Richardson, of the Vick Chemical |
Company, Greensboro, will deliver an ad-|
dress on taxation and its relations to busi- |
ness and manufacturing in the state, at a
dinner meeting of the Wilmington Real Es- |
tate board to be held Thursday night at 7 :00
o'clock, at the Cape Fear Hotel.

“Mr. Richardson, who is regarded as an
authority on taxation, having made a careful
study. of the subject in North Carolina, is an |
interesting speaker and a man who is closely
identified with the real estate business of the |
state.

“He will deliver thgsame address here
that was so cHectivetMclivered by himself |
at the recent state convention of the North
Carolina Real Estate board in Charlotte. |
The realty men then were greatly impressed
with the address, believing it be the base of |
a question so vital to the best interests of |
the state.

“City and county officials and the president
and secretary of the chamber of commerce |
have been invited to attend.”

Man-power

Four millions of the best man-power of Europe
perished in the Napoleonic conquests. Military con-
quest is non-creative, while industry is always

cre tive.

In the last ten years one American manufacturer—

the General Electric Company:

-has created machines

having a man-power forty times as great as that of
all the lives lost in the Napoleonic wars.

In the years to come, when the college men and women
of today are at the helm of industry and of the home,
it will be realized more and more that human energy
is too valuable to be wasted where electricity can do

the work better at lower cost.
