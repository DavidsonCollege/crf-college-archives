WOODROW WILSON CHAIR OF
ECONOMICS IS A BIG HELP

During the recent Million Dollar Cam-
paign the Gastonia, N. C., Presbyterian
Church made it possible to establish the
Woodrow Wilson Chair of Economics
and Political Science at Davidson. This
church by their $50,000 donation secured
for Davidson an everlasting benefit and
established a fitting to the
greatest alumnus of Davidson College,
Woodrow Wilson.

memorial

Mr. Wilson, when he learned that this
chair was established in his name, ac-
knowledged the distinction in a letter to
Dr. Martin. In this letter Mr. Wilson
voiced his appreciation of the honor
and his feeling of goodwill and affection
for Davidson.

Since the founding of this chair in
1920 it has been occupied by Prof. A.
Currie, A.B. (Davidson College, Columbia
University, Cornell University). Profes-
sor Currie has built up this chair until
now it is one of the most popular and
successful courses at Davidson.

WINSTON ALUMNUS SUGGESTS
LEAVING PLANS TO FACULTY

The following letter, dated December
5, has been received by the Alumni Edi-
tor from a member of the Davidson
Alumni Association of Winston-Salem:

Davidson alumni everywhere are deep-
ly grieved to learn of the fire which de-
stroyed the Chambers building and yet
we all believe that this is but the be-
ginning of better things for the college
and the dawning of the day of David-

sen’s greatest growth in progress and
efficiency. Every alumnus is almost |
brimming over with plans for the recon-
struction to come and the design of the
new buildings which shall start the new)
era. |

I have talked and written to numbers

of ‘the alumni all over the country and) a5 born at W adesboro, N.C, and WaS) Southern Power Company near Great
graduated from the high school of his) prays s. ©,

everywhere it is the same story. There
lies a danger in that very enthusiasm, |
however, which will doubtless cause
some embarrassment to the authorities |
unles we of the alumni see it and pre- |
vent it in time. Nearly every one of us
has his little pet idea of just what must |
be done to best work out the plan. Now|
there are so many of us that it will be)
manifestly impossible to do anything
that will not conflict wih somebody’s lit- |
tle hobby or some fellow’s most hal-|
lowed associations. Hardly any two of
us want exactly the same thing and very |
few of us know enough about the actual,
conditons to plan very wisely. Now
wouldn’t it be wiser for all of us to take
this position: Let the college authorities |
get the best advice and help in planning,
from the best architect in the United
States who specializes in college work.
Then when the plan is made, let them
work it out to the greatest extent their
means and our help can _ accomplish.
“Whatever that plan may be, we will back
it to the last ditch whether it fits our pet
associations or not. I have not consulted
the college authorities in making this
suggestion but I have talked to enough |
of the alumni to know it is necessary
and I should like to hear from some of
the other alumni through your pages in
this regard. I have enough faith in the
alumni of Davidson College to believe
they will see the point and be good!
enough sportsmen to stand behind the
college in any plan it may decide on.
Yours loyally,
James C. Harper.

HAROLD LLOYD COMEDY AND
LITTLE ITALY AT PICTURES

After laughing till the tears came at a
two-year-old Harold Lloyd comedy, the
spectators at the movies Saturday night!
settled back to watch Alice Brady in
“Little Italy.” Ordinarily such com-
edies as have been shown here have
been run after the main show, but for
a change this one was run beforehand.

“Little Italy’ would have been pretty |
good if there had only been a little less |
‘of it. A strange note in the play was an|
Irish priest in charge of an _ Italian
parish.

Saturday’s show will be Elsie Fergu-| proved himself

STONEWALL JACKSON CAME

HERE ON VISIT YEARS AGO

A Writer in the Baltimore Sun Gives the ‘© Miss Flora Jones, of Sanford, N. C.,

Following interesting account of a
Visit of General Stonewall Jack-
son to Davidson.

To the Editor of the Baltimore Sun—
Sir: Your account of the burning of
Chambers Hall, Davidson College, North
Carolina, November 28th recalls a most
interesting association of the institution
with the foremost military genius the
world ~has seen since the passing of
Napoleon.

When Major T. J. Jackson was paying
his Miss Anna Morrison,
the lady who became his second wife,
July, 1857,

addresses to

he visited the college while

on his way to the Morison home
in an adjoining county, and = was
the guest of his prospective broth-,

Major D. H. Hill, then in!
charge of the mathematical department.
‘The Chambers building was then in its
initial stage, 1857; the college was found-
ed in 1837, the Rev. R. H. Morrison, Jack-

er-inlaw,

son's second father-in-law being the
president.
The first Mrs. Jackson was Miss

Eleanor Junkin, whose father, northern
by birth and sympathy, was president of
Washington College, 1840-1861, casting
lot with the the Union.
Jackson was left desolate after a brief
period of married life. During Hunter's
raid upon Lexington, Va. Dr. Junkin
accompanied the Federal forces, June
1864, visiting the grave of Jackson and
his first wife in the historic cemetery
whose renown has circled the earth with
its glory.

DR. JAMES A. McLAUCHLIN
MAKING A FINE RECORD)!

Dr. James Argyle McLauchlin, 1887,

: ea |
native town. He then came to David-

son where he took the A.B. degree in
1887 and later came back and took his |
M.A. degree. ;

In 1900 he was given the honorary de-|
gree of Doctor of Literature by King)
College, Bristol, Va. His experience as)
«an educator has been of a broad and
liberal character. He taught in Kansas
for four years, and for five years was.
superintendent of schools of his native

town, Wadesboro, while he further!
spent seven years as professor of math-
ematics in Austin College, Sherman,
Texas. |

After leaving Austin College, Dr. Mc-
Lauchlin’ was for four years superin-|
tendent of schools at Mangum, Oklaho-
ma, where he met with splendid success.
So well was his work done at that place
that he was called to the presidency of |
the Central State Normal School at Ed-
For three years he}
directed the affairs of this institution, |
and as a result of his efforts the attend-
ance was increased from 1,100 in June,
1908, to about 1,700 in June, 1911, a gain
of about sixty per cent, and that during
the days of state construction, when
things were in a disturbed and unsatis-
factory condition. It is significant that
during this time President McLauchlin
was instrumental in arranging with the
proper authorities of 20 states to accept
the diploma of the Central Normal
School as liscense to teach in those
states without further examination.

For nearly four years, now, he has
been the head of the department of
Foreign Languages at the Southwestern
State Normal School, of Oklahoma. |
Here, as elsewhere, he has shown the
same scholarly, dignified, high-toned |
character and his work reflects the type |
of man he is. As a Latinist, his method)
of instruction is pedagogical and sound, |
while his technique, his feeling, for the |
heart and spirit of his work is eminent- |
ly correct. The same methods pervade
the other languages which he is called!
upon to teach, and he possesses in a}
large measure the faculty of leading}
students to feel and appreciate literature |
as well as master its mechanical ap-;
paratus. |

As a man Doctor McLauchlin
the highest

has
type of

|gentleman, while as a friend it can be{«

said of him as it was beautifully said in
the epitaph of the little New England
maiden: “Think what a friend should be:
she was all of that.”
