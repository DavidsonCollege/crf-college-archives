Council ponders club sport changes

By DENNIS McLAWHORN
Asst. News Editor

The Council on Campus and
Religious Life will soon consider a
report that recommends major
changes in the administration of the
Davidson club sports program.

The report, drafted by the Ad Hoc
Committee on Sports Clubs,
evaluates the program and includes
recommendations for the improve-
ment of the clubs.

The report deals with policies on
finances, insurance, the relationship
with the Athletic Department, access
to facilities, medical needs, and
authority over the sports clubs.

There is currently no authority to
whom the sports clubs report.

Club sports are not considered part
of intramurals, varsity athletics, nor
the physical education program. The
College has not officially recognized
them, and the clubs are not governed
by the Student Senate.

Vol. LXVI, No. FIFTEEN

WILL THESE RUGGERS get
more money? (Irv Wilson)

In most cases, club money comes
from three sources: (1) membership
dues, (2) fund-raising projects, most
of which have been ineffectual, and (3)
appropriations from the Athletic
Department.

The amount appropriated by the

_ Athletic Department to club sports

this year was $1200, as opposed to
$2000 in 1975-76. The total budgets of
the clubs for 1976-77 was around
$11,800. _

The Athletic Department has been
reluctant to allow sports clubs to use
its medical facilities. The Department
believes it has neither the time, funds,
nor the personnel to service the sports
clubs. Presently, most sports club
injuries are handled by the infirmary
or by local hospital personnel.

To deal with these and other
problems, the report recommends
that the Senate take charge of the
sports clubs, establish flexible
regulations for them, and provide
some financing for them.

Also, the report says that the
College should allocate sufficient
funds to the sports clubs through the
Activities Tax Council. However, the
report calls for each club to provide at

least one half of its own budget
through dues, fund-raising projects,
etc.

Another recommendation
prescribes the formation of a
committee responsible for advising,
regulating, and generally overseeing
club sports.

The report also suggests the
appointment of an administrator
within the Athletic Department. This
person would compile a schedule of
sports club activities, coordinate use
of facilities, and serve as a mediator
between club sports and the Athletic
Department.

The report recommends that the
sports clubs be allowed access to the
training facilities, and that a person
trained in first aid be assigned to
work with sports clubs.

The Ad Hoc Committee, chaired by
Assistant Dean of Students Mary
Lou Dietler, submitted its report to
the Council on Campus and Religious
Life, where it was approved before
Christmas.

The report then went before the
Advisory Council on Intercollegiate
Atheltics for a second opinion, and
will return to the Council on Campus
and Religious Life next week to seek
final approval before it is sent to

Due to a continued lack of
funding, Martin Science Buil-
ding still awaits renovation.

“Tt is a very hot issue with
us,” commented Vice-Presi-
dent for Development Dwayne
Dittman, ‘‘but it is so up in
the air at this point.”

Dittman explained that in
September it had been hoped
that a grant for the entire
renovation might be obtained
from Reynolds Industries.

Business problems within
the company, however, pre-’
vented Reynolds from contri-
buting a large grant.

Instead of turning the col-

. lege down completely Rey-
nolds contributed what Ditt-
man'‘termed a “modest grant”’
which has been put into a fund
with smaller gifts to be used
for the project.

The estimated cost of the
proposed renovation was
$750,000 last April but Ditt-
man indicated that a more
reasonable estimate today was
between $800,000 and

Martin awaits renovation,
Reynolds reconsiders grant

$850,000.

The renovation would in-
clude the construction of a
storage wing at the rear of the
present facility in addition to
modernizing labs and. equip-
ment.

Dittman did not completely
rule Reynolds out as a source
of funding. After the college
received the initial modest
grant it asked Reynolds to
reconsider funding the entire
project. Representatives from
the college and from Reynolds
will meet in March and make
the final decision.

Dittman praised Chemistry
Department Department J.
Nicholas Burnett’s work in
trying to secure money for the
project.

“Dr. Burnett has done a
fabulous job writing a propo-
sal to the National Science
Foundation for mostly pro-
gram funds, but including
$100,000 for space renovation
which could be part of the
total renovation objectives,”’
he added.

Dittman indicated that if

STUDENT DJ’s are wary of administration's efforts to
raise funds to change WDAV.

(Hunter Jennings),

these funding possibilities fell
through there would still be
another avenue open for con-
sideration.

“We could establish a cam-
paign for many smaller gifts,
but that type of campaign is
very time consuming and diff-
icult and Martin is our highest
priority in our $35 million
campaign,’ he said.

Dittman cautioned against
the word priority, however,
saying that it often is mis-
leading. A donor might only
want to contribute money for a
low priority item and of course
the college would not discour-
age such a gift.

“At the moment, however,
we have to pin our hopes on
the Reynolds Grant,’’ he con-
cluded.

Changes planned for WDAV

By AMANDA HALL
Managing Editor

Davidson College plans to
raise the power of WDAV to
18,540 watts pending approval
of the Federal Communica-
tions Commission (FCC) Feb-
ruary 15 and the college trus-
tees February 24.

The increased power will
enable WDAV to reach the
Charlotte audience in hope of

- raising money for the college
“there, according to College
- President Samuel R. Spencer

dr.

“This is money sent after
money,’ Spencer said. “(The
increase) will get you money in
the long. run.”

“(To get the money) we
have to raise it,’’ he said.

‘‘There is no question about
the fact that Davidson has lost
community impact in Char-
lotte. Charlotte is whére we
need to raise our money. We
lost the impact because Cen-
tral Piedmont and UNCC are
serving Charlotte in ways we
are not. We once had a
basketball program that drew,
but now we don’t. We need a
rejuvenated impact.”

Because the increased power
necessitates the station broad-
cast year-round an automation
system may be installed. Ac-
cording to Director of News
and. Photography Earl W.
Lawrimore this system will be
acquired sometime in the fut-
ure and the college will hire
DJ’s to operate the station

during the holidays before
then.

The station’s broadcast for-
mat will be altered when the
change takes place to cater to
the Charlotte audience during
the day. Sixty percent of the
broadcasting will be student-
oriented and forty percent will
be classical and educational
programming.

“With the (application for
increased power at the FCC)
we have contemporary. music
from sign on to noon, educa-
tional and classical from noon
to 8 pm, and from 8 pm to sign
off contemporary music ag-
ain,” said Jack Golden, former
WDAV station manager, who
