For an unusual break, try parachuting

By AURIE HALL
Staff Writer

“If man were meant to fly, God would
have given him wings.” Not long. ago
this would have been my response to
parachuting. What is the least bit
appealing about dropping thousands of
feet through the atmosphere with only a
small cord and some nylon material
between you and your Maker? Even if
your proceed at the anticipated gentle
pace through the air, there is: still
landing to contend with, as trees, power

lines, and church steeples. lie between |

you and terra firma. It all sounded -crazy
to me. But then, my younger siblings

always climbed trees, jumped off the:

high dive, and rode roller coasters before :

I did. I am a chicken at heart: .

So, when Elizabeth approached me
about parachuting for the Davidsonian,
I was understandably dubious. The
reason I eventually agreed was twofold.
First, I was one of the seniors who
checked ‘‘no’”’ on The Davidsoian’s
questionnaire beside the questions, ‘‘Do
you know exactly what you will be doing

next year?” and ‘‘Have you chosen what

you regard as your lifetime vocation? I
figured I had little to lose.
And second, I had jumped once, two
years ago, at the same place, so it wasn’t
entirely new to me.

Despite a few restless nights and
parachuting horror stories passed on by
well- “meaning friends, I found myself
cruising down the highway with Andy
Starnes and Dave Dusseault, who had
decided to take the plunge with me. My

housemates had bid me farewell by:
gleefully requesting certain possessions -

of mine in the event of my demise.
We arrived at the Paracenter just as

the training class was beginning. The
Metrolina Paracenter is run by the

Charlotte Skydivers Club, one of the
oldest operating clubs in the country.
Last year alone they trained 300 peonle
to parachute. Our instructor was Mi-
chael Morgan, who has made about 660

jumps himself. We were training with a

-group from Winthrop College who were

good natured and jovial. I was trying to
appear unconcerned and nonchalant. It
wasn’t working very well.

Throughout our training, Mr. Morgan
joked with us, answered our questions,
and patiently went over the drills. One of
his favorite quips was, “He who hesi-
tates inherits the-earth.’’ I was amused
in spite of myself. After he showed us
the exiting procedure, Mr. Morgan
asked if there were any questions. One
guy raised his hand and asked, ‘‘Who’s
gonna peel my hands off the strut?”” My
sentiments exactly, I thought. Just out
or curiousity, | asked how long it would
take to land if neither parachute nor
reserve chute opened. Mr. Morgan smile
and said, ‘If that happens, you'll be 25
seconds away from oblivion.” ‘“‘Not long
enough to say the Lord’s Prayer, it
that’s what you want to know,” another
student grinned. I felt a sinking feeling
in my stomach.

To prepare to jump, we suited up in
boots, jump suits, helmets, parachutes,
and reserve chutes, and boarded the
plane. Andy, Dave and I were jumping
together, with Dave jumping first, Andy

’ second and me last. Resigned to my fate,

I sighed depply and crawled into the
plane. Because it was small, it rattled a
lot when we took off. I looked out the
window and thought, ‘‘The earth can’t
look much different from the air than it

does in here. So why don’t I just stay in
here?” I vaguely wondered what my
Momma would do if she knew I_ was
doing this. I quickly dismissed t that
thought and everything was fine until
they opened the door for Dave to climb
out. As the wind whipped into the plane,
Andy and I grabbed each other simul-
taneously, I started saying ‘‘Hail
Mary’s”’ very quickly as I watched Dave
let go and fall away into space. Then we
circled around for Andy’s jump. When
the door opened and the jumpmaster
told Andy to sit in the door, Andy
grabbed his arm and said, ‘‘I really don’t
think I can do it, I really don’t.”’
Protesting, Andy climbed out and I
watched him drop away with tears in my
syes. Now it was my turn. As we circled
around for the last time, I inched up by
the door and tried to find the landing
target from the window. Before this
jump I felt nervous but not terrified. On
my first jump I thought I would
probably not survive, or at least was
reasonably assured that I wouldn’t.
When my chute had opened up above
me, I was so thrilled I was still alive |
felt that a miracle had occurred. But on
the second jump, when I let go of the
strut and arched back into space, I was

not so surprised to find that my

parachute had had opened and that I was
ting about in the air: I looked around

and saw farmland sweeping away. Lots
of churches and white farmhouses and
trees and plowed fields stretched out
below me and I thought I could see
Charlotte in the distance. It was quiet,
and I could feel the wind rushing against
my face. Suddenly, I remembered that I
still had to get down, and I began
turning in circles looking for the arrow
which would guide me down. After a
minute or so I found it and, occasionally
turning, I drifted down and landed, a
little hard, in a field pretty close of:
target. Andy had landed behind a
Holiday Inn sign across the road and
Dave had landed in a field nearby. We
greeted each other exhuberantly, glad to
see we were still alive. I queried the
beaming faces around me about their
first jumps, and the verdict was un-
animous: ‘‘It was incredible.” ‘“‘Marv-

elous.”” “‘Magificent.”” ‘‘Wild.’”’ Dave

‘announced that he wanted to go again,

immediately, but it was late, and we had
to go home. Andy has decided to go
again next weekend. Dave might, too. I

_ might hang my chute up for another two

years, but then again I might not.

Ice cream, cookies, and saris enliven Town Day

By JOHN KROTCHKO

It seemed like everyone in
Davidson turned out for Town
Day last Saturday. Folks lined
Main Street as the little parade,
led by the almost-majestic Dav-
idson College Pep Band, pro-
cessed toward the Village Green
for the annual festivities. All of
the important people were in the
parade: the mayor, the chief of
police, the volunteer fire depart-
ment and, of course, the chil-
dren. Old cars, equestrians, and
hordes of bike riders, a minia-
ture putt-putt antique auto,
and a lot of townspeople passed
by with smiles and: waves. It
was a healthy slice of small-
town American apple pie, and a
real treat for someone who grew
up in the general vicinity of the
New Jersey Turnpike.

The Village Green festivities
included bake sales, plant sales,
an old-time ice cream social,
and games for everyone. The
New Schoolhouse of the Arts

children brought their arts and

crafts to display, and set up
operations to turn ordinary
children into bright-faced
clowns. French Professor.

“Are you from the Charlotte

“Do you ‘every read it?”

“No, I always read the Ob-

“I'll bet that’s because
there’s comics in the Observer.

’ (indignant) ‘‘Huh-unh!”’

‘‘Well, what do you read
then?’’

“Uh...”

As I wandered over toward

‘Church women’s bake sale, the

sight of some home-cooked
brownies made me regret the

current state of my financial.

“If I had any money, I’d buy
somé of those brownies from

you,” I said. ‘“‘They sure look
good.”

“They are good! Only
twenty-five cents for two.”

“Twenty-five cents?’ (dig-
ging in my pocket) ‘‘That’s not
bad at all!”’

‘‘Look,’’ one woman said,
handing over a pack of cookies
with the brownies, ‘‘don’t tell
nobody I’m doing this. Take
it.”

suggest that it be turned into a
