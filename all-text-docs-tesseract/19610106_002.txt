THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO .

FRIDAY, JANUARY 6, 1961

(All Unsigned Editorials oy the Editor)
The Poor Man's Princeton

Resourceful John Horton’s persis-
tent press agentry has paid off in the
past few weeks with a bonanza of
javorable ublicity for Davidson Col-
ege.

In the same week that Dean Rusk,
who calls Davidson “the poor man’s

Princeton" eclipsed Woodrow Wilson

as The Most Famous Davidsonian (as

we all know, the President quit us
after a year), Henry Shue became our
138th Rhodes Scholar.

But even before that, The Charlotte
News ran an effusive full page fea-
ture with pictures on Davidson Col-
lege. And a lady reporter from The
Charlotte Observer came over and
was enthralled by Dr. W. O. Puckett
to the tune of a very flattering story
on page one, second section. It seem-
ed as if Davidson had indeed found
its place in the sun—at least in the
Charlotte papers.

All this fanfare was fine. but just

‘one little item stuck in our craw:

It was in the big News feature. hun-
dreds of copies of which are stored
in the basement of Chambers build-
ing waiting to be handed out to pro-
spective donors to the Living Endow-
ment.

The item was this:

“Young professors, who love to
teach and who are paid well, are

in the classrooms. New techniques

and ideas are constantly being ‘m-

plemented by a faculty 95 per cent

of which takes a dynamic interest

in the entire curriculum.”

We wonder if the voung reporter
who wrote this knew exactly how
many of Davidson’s professors can be
considered “young.”

We wonder upon what basis he
computed his percentages. We sug-
gest that if he’s going to lie with
3tatistics he should at least do it
subtly.

We wonder if he knew that most of
the English majors in the Senior Class
nave for fairly obvious reasons, never
taken a course in Shakespeare. The
course is only offered every other
year anyway, and most of them get
their Shakespeare on their own or do
without (it is known that some experts
consider Shakespeare to be a fairly

Coffee And Talk

The math department’s brand new
“Coffee and Talk” sessions are one of
the longest strides forward toward
more profitable faculty - student rela-
tionships made recently.

Coffee and Talk works this way:

Math majors, students taking some
math course and even students not
associated with the department are
invited to an open house at the Facul-
ty Club on old fraternity row on the
second Wednesday afternoon of each
month.

For an hour, the participants shoot
the bull and drink coffee with mem-
bers of the department. During the
next hour an informative program is
presented that strikes at a level which
would interest both the math major
taking advanced courses and the
freshmen taking a basic course.

erature).

We wonder if he knew that David-

We imagine someone told him
about the extravagant, elaborate roll-
away stage that is to be installed in
the new fine arts building, but did
anyone tell him that Davidson does
not employ a professor of drama?

Do you suppose he knew that 40
son still has six 1-man departments
Davidson graduates?

Did he know that Davidson pays an
economics professor: to teach who
claims that he has never read a word
of Karl Marx and never intends to?

And how about that oath professors
have to take before they can teach
here? How many fine instructors do
you suppose that thing has driven
off?

There is room for vast improve-
ment.

Davidson College need not he satis-
fied with a few fine. departments.
such as math, chemistry and the pre-
med program.

We would like to see Davidson em-
bark. upon a 10-year crash program to
veef units faculty. This project would
be similar to the highly successful
10-year building program just com-
pleted. .

We would like to see a sweeping
evaluation made, department by de-
partment, of our teaching personnel.
Professorial dead weight should be
hauled out of weak departments and
replaced by men who really do take
a “dynamic interest.”

We would like to see Davidson be-
come more choosy in its hiring and
tougher in its firing. We realize that
tenure regulations prevent the firing
of some professors merely because
But we
would suggest that moral suasion be
used a little more liberally. Some
men, to put it bluntly, cannot be
kicked out, but should be. urged to
find employment at some other in-
stitution.

Davidson may indeed be the poor
man’s Princeton.
~ But why be satisfied with second
best?

Dr. W. G. McGavock says that the
idea has worked extremely well so
far. Incomplete returns from a ques:
tionnaire sent to participants indicate
that they think Coffee and Talk is
well worth continuing.

We don’t see why it wouldn’t work
in other departments as well. The
student seldom has a chance to meet
with professors and fellow majors in
a department as a group.

Several departments, particularly
the languages, have honorary clubs
or fraternities, but these are not open
house affairs. The Business-Econom-
ics Association is about the closest
thing to Coffee and Talk but mem-
bership is still by invitation and dues
are charged.

We feel that the mathematicians
have the right idea. |

It might be worth looking in to.

In The Davidson Tradition

When it comes time to boast about
the excellence of its graduates, Da-
vidson College need not be modest.

This was proved again with the an-
nouncement that Davidson student

Henry Grayson Shue was one of four
undergraduates picked as Rhodes
Scholars by the Southern Committee
of Selections.

Rhodes Scholarships are among

the most widely sought-after graduate
study grants in the United States.
They provide two years of advanced
study at England’s famed Oxford Uni-
versity.
Since 1903, 13 Davidson graduates
have been recipients of these scholar-
ships. Seven of these were granted
since 1950, ranking Davidson among
the top ten American liberal arts col-
leges in the percentage of its gradu-
ates who have won Rhodes Scholar-
ships.

And the record does not end there.
In 1959, for example, Davidson rank-
ed ninth in the nation in its percen-
tage of Danforth Scholarship winners,
fourth in Rockefeller Brothers Schol-
arships, and third in Southern Teach-
ing Fellowships.

The Davidson Army ROTC unit that
year placed fourth among 210 Army
ROTC units in the country based on
the records made by graduates in
Army service schools.

Davidson also ranks among the top
80 colleges and universities in Amer-
ica in the percentage of its graduates
listed in Who’s Who in American Col-
leges and Universities.

More than half of Davidson's stu-
dents undertake postgraduate studies.

Davidson's athletic teams may not
be among the Top Ten every season,
but its scholars generally are. And
of the two, we'd say the latter are by
far the more important.

. Let's Keep ‘Em A Secret

By ERVIN DUGGAN

When will it all stop? ;

In Palm Beach on Christmas Day, Pierre Salinger
reported—with a straight face—that Caroline Kennedy
received a toy dog which delivers eight messages at the
pull of a string. .

“) can’t remember all the messages,” Salinger
said, as pencils scribbled and typewriters clacked. “Ill
leave them to your imagination. But one of them was
‘I'm tired.’ “

Well, so am I. - .

I'm tired of the slush which is being dispensed by
the journalists crowded around the Kennedy keyhole.

We have read what Mrs. Kennedy said upon the
solemn occasion of her son’s christening: “Look at those

eyes, Jack.”
So

We have been subjected to endless reference to
Mrs. Kennedy's Caesarian section, which Lord knows,
is a topic for her medical history but not for the front
page.

The CHARLOTTE OBSERVER has observed cooingly
that we now have—and this was in an editorial—‘‘a pin-
up president.”

Just what we need. ’ ,

This week, LOOK magazine tells us that John
Fitzgerald Kennedy takes four showers a day, cleans
his glasses with his shirttail, drives like the devil and
curses like a sailor.

The above tidbits appeared in a feature spread en-
titled. “What You Don’t Know About Kennedy.”

The article adds that the president-elect drinks milk,

' doesn’t carry cash...” and“. . . is seldom on time.’

The first round of interviews
were conducted on the state lev-
el the Tuesday and Wednesday
before Christmas vacation.
Eight men were chosen from
all the applicants, who had each
submitted a 1,000 word “intel-
lectual autobiography” and
provided eight references.

Tuesday night the students
and committee members held
informal discussions.

Wednesday, each of the
eight spplicants wes inter-
viewed by the committee,
which wes meade up ef past
Rhodes scholers with a non-
Rhodes scholar as chairman.

Shue said the first question
asked was why he depledged
from his fraternity. and after a
discussion of this ne was asked
about his involvement with the
Westminster Fellowship and.
the Church session over the
panel on the sit-ins last year.

This in turn led into a dis-
cussion of the responsibility of
the individual Christian to so-
ciety, as opposed to the
Church’s responsibility as an
“That was a topic
I thought I'd butchered.” com-
mented Shue. “They really
twisted me around on that one.”

Later in the day Shue and two
other students were called back
‘for a second half-hour inter-
| view.

The second interview was
opened with the question, “Do
you think the U. S. should
recognize Red China.” Shue
supported the position that
we should.

He was then asked who he
thought was the greatest lead-
ler in Western Civilization. He
‘said he stared at the floor a

alternative of listing what he
considered to be the qualities a
great leader should have.

The committee then asked
him whieh American presi-
dent he thought best embod-
ied these quelities, and Shue
chose Woedrow Wilson. A
committee member then pro-
ceeded to demonstrate that
Thomas Jeffersen fitted them

seid he had te admit leter te
the men thet he hed made

That night the state winners
were announced by the com-
mittee at a special dinner.

The final competition was
held in Atlanta, where 12 can-
didates. two from each South-
ern state. were interviewed.

Shue described the atmos-
phere of the final interviews
as “Extraordinarily relaxed, in-
formal. friendly. and sympa-
thetic.” The questioning was
aggressive, but there was not
hostile cross-examination. “They
seem to have a reai knack for
making you show yourself.” he
commented.

The interview was begun
by an anoointed questioner
whe inquired sbout a phrase

Shue had used in his auto-
biography, “The fear of un-
certainty.” This led into @
philosophical and religious
diz-u-sion, which was pretty

for.

as the truth of the Christian

Amateurs, infected by the zeal of the keyhole
journalists, are beginning to note that Mrs. Kennedy
is a bit bowlegged, a fact which the reporters have
somehow omitted, though they’ve doubtless noticed.

riod came whet Shue called
the worst pert ef the whele
process — waiting fer the
committee's decision. ;

Immediately after making
the decision, the committee an-
nounced the results. A Satur-
day night dinner then ended
the competition.

In conclusion, Shue- said that
they seem to be interested not
in sheer brilliance, but rather
in whether you know enough to
hold an opinion and are willing
to withdraw when your posi-
tion is proven untenable.

Athletics, he seid, seem to
be the jeast important of the
qualities sought for, although
athletic attainment is def-
initely an asset.

Shue reported that Dr. Cum-
mings’ urging had been the
deciding factor in his decision
to apply for the scholarship,
although he was the only ap-
plicant from Davidson this year.

What if Khrushchev offers him a dsiquiri?
Mr. Salinger, I protest.

NOSMO KING REPORTS...

Peons, ROTC Studied
By Amateur Pollster

This is the first in a series of spasmodic reports on
the contemporary Davidson scene by Nosmo King, David-
son student and amateur pollster. Although primarily
interested in predicting future movements and trends,
Nosmo will endeavor also to present current trends
which might otherwise escape notice.

... Biggest thing of the season ahead will be a
move by a violent group of warmongers to overthrow
and destroy the pacifist elements of the Peon Army.
| Attempting to present an organization dedicated to the
annihilation of the ROTC with appeal to every campus

He concluded on a note of | faction, the new group will inaugurate a series of tactical

appreciation to the college by
observing, “I do think this is
an award which reflects con-
siderably more on the college
than on the student due to its
broad basis of selection.” In
connection with this,
pressed the hope that in the
future more Davidson students
would apply for Rhodes schol-
arships.

LETTERS TO THE EDITORS

Ricks Lands Legislature
For Mature Discussion

Dear Editor,

This letter is being written to
inform the Student Body about
the activity of the Davidson del-
egation at the State Student
Legislature held in the Capito!
Building at Raleigh, December
8-10.

Our delegation (one of 27
.from different colleges and un-
iversities in North Carolina) in-
troduced an amendment to the
:SSL Constitution concerning
elections procedure which eas-
ily passed.

BILL PRESENTED

We also presented a bill pro-
viding for the setup of a com-
mittee to study the tremendous
problem of converting the U. S.
economy from the present de-
fense - spending basis to a post-
disarmament basis~in case dis-
armament should be :arried
out. Our arguments were: One
third of our nation’s economic
activity and one-tenth of our
labor force are now involved

President-elect Kennedy said
in March 1960 that “the entire
government staff currently en-

gaged in disarmament research
consists of fewer than 100 full-
time men, scattered through
four or five agencies with little
or no co-ordination.” We saw
disarmament as the major prob-
lem of our time.

After Davidson's speakers
presented other facts concern-
ing the problem, the combined
Senate and House of Represen-

tatives passed our bill with un-.

animous consent.
VALUE
We Davidson delegates felt
that we derived these worth-
while values from the Legisla-
ture: practical knowledge of
parliamentary procedure,

ma-

ture discussion with campus
leaders in the state, and a bet-
ter understanding of the intri-
cate processes of state legisla-
tion.

We also developed superior-
ity complexes, because the
pages treated us with the re-
spect due regular legislators by
waiting on us at all times dur-
ing the session. We feel that
the money and time spent on
this project were well - worth
while and hope that Davidson
will continue to show an inter-
est in this state forum of stu-
dent thought.
