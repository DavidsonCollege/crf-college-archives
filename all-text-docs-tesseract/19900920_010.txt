Duke Goes Down, Cats Soccer 7-1

With about five minutes and
forty seconds leftinaticd Davidson
soccer game against Duke, fresh-
man John Sampcrs turned from
about four or five yards outside of
the goal and hita shot between two
defenders.:The shot was good.and
it put us up 3-2.

That score would stand, and
Davidson would Icave Durham
with onc of its biggest soccer vic-
torics ever.

Davidson not only beat Duke
innumber of goals scored, butthey
also outplayed the Blue Devils up
and down the field.

Coach Charlie Slagle said that
the win: “Has to be the biggest vic-
tory , because we beat a big name
tcam on the road.”

Coach Slagle was very im-
pressed with how the team played
together. They out shot Duke 15-

13 and had seven corner kicks to
Duke’s one.

Davidson goals were scored
by Sampcrs and Rob Ukrop.
Sampers scored first and then
Ukrop added another goal on a
penalty kick to. put. Davidson up
2-0.

Duke then stormed back, scor-
ing two goals in a span of three
minutes to tic the game at two all.
Sampers then madc his miraculous
play to give the Wildcats the vic-
tory.

The victory over Duke is such
a tremendous win for a number of
reasons. Duke has a very strong
nationally recognized soccer team
that was ranked number fourteen
in the nation last week, ranked
ahead of the Cats in the South at the
number five position.

Such a win by a non-scholar-

ship team over a team that hands
out about eleven scholarships
underlines the fact that this was a
big victory.

Coach Slagle was very im-*

pressed with the huge turnout of
Davidson fans.

The crowd was extremely
vocal and much louder than the
Duke fans, despite the fact that
Dukc had the home field advan-

lage.

Football Making Gridiron History

In what Head coach DaveFagg
characterized as perhaps the finest
win of his coaching career, the
rejuvenated Wildcats handed
Johnson C. Smith a 17-7 setback
before 1,800 frenzied fans at
Richardson Field.

A gutty defensive effort won
the game for Davidson; four times
the Wildcat defense stopped the
Bulls on fourth down deep in
Davidson territory.

Entering the game, coach Fagg
had feared the Bulls’ powerful and
athletic offense, and Smith’s ini-
tial two possessions realized those
fears.

Led by all-CIAA quarterback
Maurice Flowers, the Bulls’ first
drive reached the Davidson 23-
yard line with relative ease. But
four downs later, when Alden
Smith knocked away a Flowers
pass, the drive stalled.

Their second drive began at
the Davidson 20 after a Mark
Wainwright fumble. Seven subse-

quent plays brought them to the
Davidson 3.

But LB Martin McCann’s
tackle of Smith RB Tyrone Corlew
at the 1-yard line on fourth and
goal kept the game scoreless.

Finally, with 4:47 left in the
half, the Wildcat offense struck.
Bryn Robinson punctuated a 58
yard drive with a 1 yard touch-
down run. The 7-0 score stood
until halftime.

The Bulls evened the score with
5:30 Ieft in the third quaricron
BruceGaillard’s3 yardtouchdown
run, but the deadlock was short-
lived. On the ensuing drive, the
Wildcats marched methodically
into Smith territory.

Freshman kicker Drew Fas-
sett’s 30 yard field goal gave the
‘Cats a 10-7 cushion. The Wildcat
defense then came on to preserve
the victory, and preserve it they
did. Twice in the fourth quarter it
stopped the Bulls on downs deep
in Davidson territory.

When, with 2:26 left, DB Lin-
sey Millsintercepteda Wesley Tate
pass and sprinted 42 yards down
the sideline to score, the game was
effectively over.

The 17-7 final was the ‘Cats
second straight win, and their long-
est winning streak since 1980.

Kicking Butt and
Taking Names

By BRUCE BALESTIER

The trophy sits prominently
on coach Rebecca Hawkins desk,
the first piece in Davidson volley-
ball’s trophy collection, a collec-
tion which could grow to be im-
mense.

Hawkins’ squad picked it up
by winning the College of Char-
leston tournament last weekend.

The Wildcats won five matches
over two days to take the title.
Davidson entered Wednesday
night’s contest with UNC-Grcens-
boro with a spouess 10-0 record.

Their 1-0 mark in Big South
play has them perched atop the
conference standings. Asexpected,
junior co-captains Mimi Plauche
and Holt Hathaway have carried
much of the load for the young
Wildcats.

Both were named to the all-
tournament teams at the Appala-
chian State and College of Char-

leston tournament, and Hathaway
was voted the MVP of the Char-
leston tournament.

“T was a little worried entering
the season with noseniors,” admit-
ted Hawkins, “but at the same time
I knew I had no reason to be.In
terms of talent, maturity and lead-
ership Mimi and Holt might as
well be seniors.”

“Outstanding” freshman Amy
Howard and “sparkplug” Christy
Knight have contributed mightily
for the “Cats, and the team’s depth
has made it a “good tournament
team.”

With the conference season
nearly in full stride, the Wildcats
are, according to Hawkins, “taking
it game by game.”

The long range goal for every-
oneis victory in the Big Southcon-
ference tournament.

The Wildcats lost Wednesday
night to UNC-G, winning the first
game, losing the next three.

Their record is 10-1,
