Of Suitcases and Alcohol

If one is to believe all the mad
rout about the new alcohol policy,
the long-stationary students of
Davidson now pack their bags and
head to “greener” pastures each
and every weekend. Many indig-
nant editorialists denoynced the
feared development of the “‘suit-
case syndrome” here; however, in
their exuberance they seem to have
missed the fact that, for decades,
Davidsonians have been. prone to
leave on the weekends, and that no
alcohol policy has kept them from
having a good time.

The re-establishment of the
rail line through Davidson in 1871
gave students the first real oppor-
tunity to leave the locality easily,
although they still had to gain per-
mission from a professor to léave
town (at least, until 1916). None-
theless, astudenteditorialist gushed
over being “no longer shut out
from the rest of creation.” Enter-
tainment and, for the adventurous,
alcohol, could be found in Char-
lotte and other nearby towns. Dis-
missal from the College awaited
any student caught having touched
the stuff, though!

Automobiles brought great
changes to Davidson beginning in
the early twenties. Robert Stowe
*24 had one of the first cars on
campus in 1922, and had quite a
time carousing about with his Bach-
elor Club (later Phi Gamma Delta)
friends. Actions of this sort, how-
ever, soon caught the disapproval
of ‘the conservative (meaning no
dainnctitiyi
ees. Fhey wrote iti 4924 “that the ’
students of the College are travel-
ling far and wide over the country
in automobiles and otherwise, and
thus bringing criticism upon them-
selves and the College. The Board
desires to call to the attention of the
Faculty this growing evil...”
Davidson President W.J. Martin
simply saw it as “a passing phase
of the automobile problem.”

By the late twenties, with cars

making entertainment like Char-
lotte dance clubs and women more
available, the strict Presbyterian
supporters of Davidson com-
plained of declining moral values.
Back then, they believed dancing
promoted promiscuity and impro-
piety. While the College did not
allow dancing in Davidson, stu-
dents freely held dances in Char-
lotte, where they also found easy
access to alcohol. Yet the admin-
istration, powerless to stop off-
campus dances, could not easily
restrict drinking off-campus either.
_ Students long knew, and College
Officials admitted by 1939, that
dances were a fact of life and that
to control drinking they had to
permit and chaperone dance func-
tions.

During the fifties and sixties,
big dances ‘were held four or five
times a year with Inter-Fraternity
Council sponsored bands like The
Lettermen playing, Belk dorm resi-
dents completely vacated the build-
ing, leaving it available for all of
their dates to stay the weekend. Of
course the college chaperoned the
female visitors, even though the
fraternity parties heldin rented off-
campus cabins ran after the offi-
cial dances from 12 to 4 in the
morning. The fraternities never
partied in their on-campus houses,
since after 1954 any student in
possession or having consumed al-
cohol on campus or at official
events would be dismissed. Be-
fore then, any studentcaught drink-

- ing anywhere would automatically

be dismissed.

For the remainder of the year,
however, the roadtrip dominated.
Boys will go where the girls are,
and they weren’tat Davidson. Stu-
dents: memorized the: milage to
women’s colleges like Randolph
Macon (205), Sweetbriar (210),
Converse (90), Salem (70), W.C.
(100), and others. Entire fraternity
chapters would pile into their cars
and descend upon a ladies’ cam-
pus, present themselves, and invite
those willing to join them fora date
(remember, in 1962, 85% of
Davidson was Greek). The women,
just as lonely and bored on their
own campus, lined right up. Up-
perclassmen arranged their sched-
ules so that they could make week-
day trips to'closer campuses ‘like
Winthrop (about an hour), or évén
to Randolph Macon, since the girls
there didn’t have any Wednesday
classes and could stay out ‘til mid-
night on Tuesdays. __

At least once a quarter, the
wilder men would attempt longer
trips to destinations like Washing-
ton D.C. While this might seem
tame today, remember that I-77
didn’t exist until around 1972; and
even until the late sixties I-85 to
Atlanta wasn’t complete: Every
spring they traveled to the Virginia
International Raceway, and after
graduation entire fraternities spent
a week at the beach. How did they
find the time? “Davidson was hard
back then,” comments Jerry
Blackstock 66; “but you could
manipulate it around. The guys
who played football avoided the
hard stuff... we bulled our way
through ethics and philo courses.”

Davidson had attractions of

‘its own. Up Main Street past the:

Anchor Grill you’d find Hattie’s
Truck Stop, a great one-room beer
and burger place. Students would
go for food and Pabst Blue Ribbon,
the popular beer since ‘lite’ beer
didn’t exist and it was a’ nickel
cheaper than Budwiser. When the

freight train came by about mid-
night, they would sit on the hoods
of their cars out in the parking lot,
throwing their used cans at the rail
‘cars. Unfortunately, Hattie’s
burned down some time ago.

Of course, no one can forget
Queen’s College, long a Davidson
mainstay. Queens had its own
dance weekends and parties’ just
like Davidson and other women’s
schools, and it was only twenty
miles away. Sooner or later, every
Davidson man dated at Queens,
and more than a few found wives

» there too. However, it never re-

placed the venturesome allure of
the roadtrip, since orie could date
at Queens anytime.

By 1970-71 thirty women at-
tended Davidson under an ex-
change program with women’s
colleges, and in 1974 women at-
tended as full students. At the
same time, radical changes-in ad-
ministration and student ideas re-
sulted in the 1968 Code of Respon-
sibility, with self-scheduled exams

(1970-71) and other unheard-of
freedoms. Alcohol was permitted
in private homes, the fraternity
court houses, and dorms, radically
changing the social structure of
Davidson. Fraternities left
Patterson Court with the imposi-
tion of ‘self-selection’ and the free-
domsof the late sixties hit Davidson
in full by 1972.

Even with all of the changes,
though, Davidson men still dated
elsewhere, and fraternities still held

mixers with Queens women. .

Slowly, as the excesses of the sev-
enties became the excesses of the
eighties, Davidson students
wrapped themselves ever more in
their academics and their own so-
cial scene, still laden with alcohol
but slowly ridding itself of the
heavy drug problems inherent since
the early seventies.

For many years students
roamed the county, state, and re-
gion looking for fun either banned
or otherwise not available at
Davidson. With the high peopel

of today’s student, we can hardly
‘say Davidson students do not get
out, although the social opportuni-
ties.on campus today outweigh
anything offered twenty or even
ten years ago, providing more in-
centive to stay here for the weck-
end. However, still reeling from
the shock therapy made necessary
by liability and risk management,
Patterson Courtcan’t immediately
offer the diverse social climate
found on more acclimated cam-
puses. Instead of rambling use-
lessly over the new policy, perhaps
those dissatisfied with Davidson
might wish to take up the road-trip
«, tradition, if only to find that many
other campuses are stricter than
ours. As President Walter Lingle
wrote in 1931 amidst the inane
debate over dancing, “I wish that
we could drop some of these extra-
neous discussions and get down to
the real work of the College.”
