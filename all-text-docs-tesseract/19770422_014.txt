“I’ve been in athletics for a
long time and I’ve had some
very fine experiences. But this
ranks right up there with all
the other good things that
have happened to me in athle-
CICS.

Scott, 69, is a native of
Pittsburg, Kan. He was athle-
tic director at Davidson from
1955 until his retirement in
1974.

He served.as a member of
the prestigious National Col-
legiate Athletic Association’s
basketball tournament com-
mittee from 1966 until 1975.
He-chaired the tournament
committee from 1969 until
1975

Although originally hired as
athletic director, Scott took
over the basketball coaching
duties at Davidson during his
first year when Danny Miller
resigned in mid-season. He
coached until 1960 when Lefty
Driesell was hired.

During the next decade,
with Scott as athletic director,
the Wildcats were among the
nation’s most successful major
college basketball teams,
ranking in the top twenty
seven times, going to four
NCAA tournaments and
posting seven 20-win seasons.

Scott also coached David-
son golf teams from 1955 until
1976. His golf teams won five
Southern Conference champ-
ionships—all the golf titles in
school history.

He often has been credited
as one of the strong influences
in attracting NCAA basket-
ball playoffs into the Carolinas
area. Greensboro hosted the
1974 NCAA finals during his
period as chairman of the
basketball committee and
numerous first round and
regional playoffs have been
staged in Charlotte, Raleigh
and Columbia.

The National Association of
Basketball Coaches honored
him twice. In 1968 he received

Scott

an Award of Merit for 35 years
‘of basketball coaching. In
1975 he received an Apprecia-
tion Award for contributions
to the NABC.

Scott and his wife,
former Bessie House,

the
still

reside in Davidson. They have
two children, Kristi Jo Boykin
of Charlotte and Thomas, Jr.
of Greenville, S.C. The young-
er Scott is assistant athletic
director at Furman Univer-
Sity.

fourth place. However, the
three conference losses have
been away and on hard courts.

Frank commented, ‘‘I feel
that any of the top six teams
in the conference have a
chance of winning the cham-
pionship. Since we will have
an advantage on our slower
clay courts, our performance
against the teams that de-
feated us earlier in the season
on their hard courts should be
greatly improved.

“Our chances will also be
improved if there is a strong
student turnout in both the
morning and afternoon. Stu-
dent support could be a key
factor for us.”

Several individuals have
been outstanding for David-
son this year.

Mike Barnhill has compiled
a 17-8 record playing #2
singles and Gil Kayton is 14-8
playing in the #5 singles slot.
The pair also plays #2 doubles
and_currently owns a 13-7
record.

The #3 doubles team, fresh-
men Rick Johnston ard Jeff
Lyle, have compiled an out-
standing record of 15-4.

Frank feels that there is a
strong probability that both
the #2 and #3 doubles teams
will win the conference.

Frank is pleased with the
overall performance of the
1977 team: ‘‘We have lost a lot
of close matches this season
and I feel we have done well,
especially with such a young
team. If we play exceptionally
well during the tournament,
we have a good chance of

winning.”
