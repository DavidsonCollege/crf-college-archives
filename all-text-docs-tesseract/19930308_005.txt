Too Much Negative —

In last week’s Davidsonian, an article ran on the round table discus-
sion held by members of the faculty, administration, and student body
concerning “cultural inclusiveness,” the new word for tolerance in the
Davidson community. The group found plenty of reasons for intoler-
ance, and specifically accused several groups for lacking diversity. By
meeting's end, however, the group had come up with little more than
trivial, uneffective ideas with how to deal with what they see asa growing
problem.

The Davidsonian is currently running a cartoon created by the Union
Board depicting two nuclear super heroes facing the forces of evil, the
primary evil being apathy (see opposite page). Though creative and
entertaining, the campaign accuses students of being uninterested and
unwilling to help create a better campus. It is a cliched attack on the
students. .

Though these two groups have certainly served a positive purpose,
they have also fallen prey to an all too common pattern on campus.
Again and again, letters to the editor accuse students of being unwilling
to attend meetings or hear speakers. Students don’t attend enough
basketball games or yell too much during them. The faculty is at the
athletic department’s throats and vice versa. People are infuriated over
the changes in teacher course loads. Nowhere, if you were to judge by
the general attitude of the campus, is anything good being done.

But there is. The SGA is making inroads with the Trustees on many
issues. The Reach Out program is, as usual, bringing its varied and
plentiful gift of service to the community. The Patterson Court Council
is well on its way to becoming an effective voice on campus. Students
‘are involved, and in fact, almost every student on campus performs some
sort of service outside of their daily routine. Be it in their fraternities or
eating houses, for the Union or for Reach Out, students are acting.

We need as a community to encourage this behavior rather than
always attack others. We need to Compliment each other rather than
accuse each other of being intolerant or apathetic. We need to lead by
example rather than accuse others of falling behind. Effective change
can be accomplished, but not if the community is divided, not if we are
squared against each other.

Enjoy your spring break. We’re going to the Bahamas. (Well,
actually one of us is going to Memphis, but she wants to go to the
Bahamas.)

major issue on campus.

_|Some may ask “Don’t we

have one already?” This
should not be a valid ques-
jtion. The questions that stu-
dents should ask about the
Union are:

1. Why doesn’t the Union
completely fill the needs of
the student body and the
community at the present
time?

2. What does the Union need.
to make it more attractive to
its students and the Davidson
Community?

The college union
should be a place where ev-
eryone in the community can
interact comfortably. Pres-

ently, this is not happening —

at Davidson. The Union
lacks the facilities to
accomodate this interaction.

Although the New
Union Planning Committee
has ideas of what'the Union

needs, the input of students,
faculty, and staff is ex- —
tremely important. To in-
corporate your idcas into *
the committee’s report, we
will be holding various fo-
rums and passing out sur- .
veys after spring break. In

‘the meantime, I would im-

plore you to think of what
we need in the Union,

Greiling Responds to

Ambroise

To the editors,

First of all, I wish to
convey that Ms. Ambroise’s
article had many good points.
Minorities aren’ talwayspre-
sented in favorable or factual
lights by the media. . “‘Nor-
mal” sadly seems to mean
“WASP,” and this is as un-
fortunate as it is xenophobic.
Atthe same time, before

trying to reach the largest

cally, of course, this means
the majority. I am not say-
ing that minorities aren’t
consumers, but I don’t think

Madison Avenue purposely:

excludes them: That would
not be good business.
Furthermore, television
news programs engage in
rapid reporting of facts. The
facts are that such-and-such

Lastly, many of the

major cities are by minority

Curran Corrects the Editor

To the editors,

The letter printed last
week in the Davidsonian
contains a paragraph that
was edited tothe point where
itcontaineda paragraph that
Idid not write and expresses
an opinion that I donothold.
It is not my view that
“our individual acts of self-
lexpression—including rac-
istand segregationistones—
ie to be valued and es-
teemed.”

My letter to you stated
jthat, “our individual acts of

self-expression—the flags
we fly, the bumper stickers
we use, the words and sym-
bols we choose to use and
display—take on a public
meaning that has a life of its
own and that impacts others
around us.

No matter how benign
our intentions are, we need
tolookat the “public” mean-
ings that the words and sym-
bols we use convey.”

My entire point in writ-
ing the letter was to express
the opinion that flying the

Confederate flag could rea-
sonably be taken to bea state-
ment in support of the rac-
ism of the old South, and
that therefore individuals
who do fly the Confederate
flag on this campus should
think about the impact that
such an action has on
Davidson’s goal of achiev-
ing adiverse intellectual and
social community.

Sincerely,

Windham Attacks Course Load Plan

To the editors,
Say itain’tso, Davidson.
Tell me Alex

that there’s a new plan to
reduce teaching time and in-
crease research and publish-
jing time for faculty was a bad
dream, orajoke. Tell me that
Davidson isn’t really plan-
ning to take a step down that
fateful road which leads to
incompetence in teaching,
shameless self-promotion,
and worthless “academic”

publishing. Other top-notch
colleges and universities are
plagued by problems asso-
ciated with the enormous
pressure on professors to
publish; at UNC, the teacher
of the year didn’t get tenure
because he didn’t publish
enough; at Princeton, grad
students teach most lower-
level courses so profs can
have time to do research.
Professors publish articles
thatare often worthless, serv-
ing only as tickets or green

stamps. Collect enough of
them, and you get tenure.
(Or a color TV if you pre-
fer.)

Davidson’s outstanding
professors are here because
they love to teach. Its fine
students are here because its
outstanding professors love
to-teach. Even as a fresh-
man, I had two widely ac-
claimed professors in 101-
level courses. They were
