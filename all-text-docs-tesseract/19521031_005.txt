Coach Bill Dole’s
Cats will go into action
against Harvard tomor-
row a fat forty-point
underdogs, but that’s
not the only reason
they've already got two
and a half strikes
against them. One big
reason for that is the
fact that scouts from
the Ivy League school
have eyed every game
Davidson's played so far
(Five—Count ‘em—
Five), and it won't be

~ anybody's fault but
By DICK ROPER their own if the Har-
vards don’t know more about the Cats than Dole’s men do
themselves.

Even if Dole can manage to pull something else out of his
bag of tricks, his team will have at best only an outside chance
of whipping the Yankee lads. It’s the old story of nothing to
lose and everything to gain, and Dole & Co., would dearly love
to upset the Harvard club. °

The big news of the week is that Henry Brown and Pete
Peterson will be playing tomorrow afternoon. Henry will run
from left halfback, since Fargason has pretty well staked his
claim to the fullback slot with some fine running in the last few
games.

Peterson, however. will be playing his first college
football game if he sees services tomorrow. Big Pete is prob-
ably as well known as any football player om the Davidson
roster, yet he's never played a minute of college ball. We
can't expect miracles from the Columbia, S. C., gaint, how-
ever. He’s had a rough time since he twisted a knee before the
season ever started last year.

Even Arnold Whisnant, captain and stalwart of the Cats
will be making the trip tomorrow, although it’s not certain
how much he'll play. Whiz, another Wildcat suffering from a
knee injury, has done a good job of backing up the line this

year, and he'll be missed if the leg isn’t strong enough by game

time.

As far as the Furman game is concerned, nobody could
have asked for more of a thriller. Although they allowed Fur-
man to rack up a two-touchdown lead in the first half, the Cats
roared back with everything they had. to come within a hair of
knotting the score at 14-all. When those buck-lateral plays
started clicking in the second half, the crowd came out of its
trance and became a wildly cheering mob. If Davidson had
scored again the stands might not even be there now.

It ts impossible to say that any one mistake or occa-
ston lost the game for the Cats. but it is certain that the
poor protection given quarterback Jack Ruth on passes was
one of the main reasons Davidson didn’t score again. Ruth,
who was really hitting on his aerials last Saturday, was
snowed under time and again, and it came as no surprise
when we noted he lost 57 yards during the course of the

game.

The heartbreaking aspect of the game is that actually Da-
vidson outplayed the Greenville boys in the major departments.
The Cats racked up 14 first downs while Furman got eight.
Davidson rolled up 215 yards from scrimmage, 15 more than
the Palmetto club got. Furman was penalized 60 yards. as com-
pared to five for Dole’s team. ;

When the final whistle of the Homecoming contest last
Saturday sounded, we couldn't help wondering one thing: Did
the alumni who came in for the game get just a little more dis-
gusted with their Alma Mater's football team, or did they feel
that the Cats played a hard game against what was theoretically
a better club?

We can't speak for all the alumni, but we like to think
that the reaction of Fred Holder, class of ‘51, was typical of
all the Sheepskin winners present at the game. Fred writes:

Dear Diok: _

It might be of interest to you to know how one
Davidson fan enjoyed Saturday’s ball game. No victory
came to break the Homecoming jinx but that is far out-
shadowed by the fact that the Wildcats played a game in
keeping with Davidson ideals. I for one thoroughly enjoyed
the game and I wish to congratulate Coach Dole, his staff,
and the players who showed us some real football. This
game is a clue to the fact that Davidson will be a winning
team in the near future. Hats off to the Wildcats!

Sincerely,
Fred C. Holder, '51

As long as Coach Dole and the Cats have support like
that, they won't have to worry about anything but pounding
the daylights out of their opponents. That, however, is quite a
large order at this stage of the game, with Harvard, Richmond
(no pushover any longer), George Washington, and The Citadel
looming up on the schedule.

Yes, We Have It Too!

Cats Invade Ivy League

To Meet Favo

By MOODY SMITH
A small but spirited squad of Wildcat gridders left Char-
lotte by plane this morning for Cambridge, Mass.. where they
will do battle with the Crimson of Harvard University to-

morrow afternoon.

The Cats will be several touch-
down underdogs against the big
Harvard team, which has won four
games while bowing only once.
Harvard lost only to Columbia, a
team which last week fought to
a 7-7 tie with mighty Army. Even
in losing to Columbia, the Crimson
did not look bad, going down by
a close 16.7 score.

Davidson has lost four games
while winning only one, and that
over Presbyterian. But the Wild-
cats have played some very good
football in spots. Last weekend’s
spine-tingling 14-13 loss to heavily
favored Furman was generally con-
sidered to be one of the Wildcats
best showings in several years.

The big news from the Da-
vidson camp this week has
been that Harry Peterson, the
220-pound sophomore tackle
from Columbia, S. C., has at
last recovered from an acute
knee injury and will be ready
to go against Harvard tomor.

fore the 1951 season began, and

Pikas, Kappa Sigs Hot On The Trail,
But Sigs Appear Headed For Crown

By JOHN HANDLEY

The undefeated Sigma Chis kept
rolling along this week, but they
got a real scare from the Sig Eps
in a real thriller last Tuesday. With
extra points being the deciding fac-
tors the Sigs eked out a 20-19
decision. Harry Wolfe provided the
point margin as he hauled in one
TD pass and the two extra points
which were completed by the Sigs.
The Sigma Chis also played the
Campus Club yesterday.

The Pikas stayed solidly in
second place this week as they
piled up a total of 62 points in
their two games. Led by the steady
backfield management of little Jim-
my Smith and the fine pass-receiv-
ing of Joe Pharr the Pikas rolled
to a 30-6 win over the Phi Gams,
and a 32-0 win over the SAEs.

Also fighting for second place
the Kappa Sigs downed the SAEs
25-6, the Pi Kapps 25-12, and played
the Betas yesterday.

The Sigma Chis who have played
only one of the four teams in the
top positions hit a rough week next
week as they go against the Kap-
pa Sigs and the Phi Delts. The
Pikas go after the Pi Kapps and
the Betas. With but two weeks left
to play in the season next week
should be a decisive one.

Sigma Chis 20; Sig Eps 19

With Tyler Berry handling the
backfield, Harry Wolfe snagging

Wildcat Of The Week:

Whisnant, Back For Harvard,
Really Racked Furman Boys

Playing probably his best game of the season and at a
new position fromthe center position he has played so well
for three years, Arnold Whisnant gets the nod for Wildcat of

the Week honors.

Whiz played magnificently
against the Furman’s Hurricane
from his backer-up position and
was one of the big reasons for
the fine defensive show of the
Wildcats.

Arnold is perhaps the man on the || "

Cat squad that has the most
“seniority,” having made the squad
in his sophomore year. For two
years he played offensive center
and was one of the most out-
aslanding blockers in the line.
Whiz was mentioned favorably

However, Coach Dole saw fit
