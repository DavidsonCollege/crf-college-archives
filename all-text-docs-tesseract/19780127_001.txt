Ice storm

campus,
fells tree

By MARTIN MCCOY

Head of Maintenance Irvin Braw-
ley said that last week’s ice storm
was the worst he has seen in his
eight years at Davidson.

No estimate was made of the
damage but the loss of the huge
willow oak near the Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian Church was cer-
tainly the primary casualty. The oak
tree was the largest on campus.
Estimates of its age ran from 75 to
200 years old. When the trunk was
cut, its rings revealed its actual age
to be 65.

Brawley knew that the tree had a
weak root system but said that
nothing could be done to prevent its
fall.

The weight of accumulative ice
broke limbs from numerous other

trees across the campus.
About 90 percent of the limbs
downed were elm or maple. These

‘types of wood break off with the’

weight of the ice more readily than
others. Because oak is’a strong
wood the big willow oak fell instead

of breaking.

The limbs of the big oak were
salvaged for firewood by the mainte-
nance crew. Several cross sections
will go to the Biology lab. The rest
will go for timber.

Brawley said he has received

several requests for pieces of the tree

from alumni who have sentimental

memories of studying or courting

beneath its canopy.

He said that paperweights or

Drawing set for February 16

CCRL alters self-selection

By STEVE AUSTIN
Staff Writer

Dean of Students Will H.
Terry and the Council on
Campus and Religious Life
(CCRL) have approved a new
approach to self-selection. The
date for matching freshmen
with the ten Patterson Court
houses is February 16.

Terry explained that the
new system discourages stu-
dents from joining houses in
which they have no interest
while maintaining the princi-
ple of self-selection. Above all,
Terry is committed to that
principle over group-selection.

By February 16, each inte-

rested freshman will submit to
Terry's office up to three
houses in his order of prefe-
rence. That. day, representa-
tives from the ten houses and
Terry will randomly draw the
preference sheets. The first
choices will be signed up until
the house lists are filled.

After the whole pile of
preference sheets is gone
through once, the drawing
order will be exactly reversed
and all second choices will be
given. Finally the remaining
sheets will be gone over a third
time giving third choices.

Those people not receiving
their first choice will automa-

Davidson Police Department divides;
Hughes directs college headquarters

By SALLIE SUMMEY

Davidson town and college
police forces divided into two
seperate departments today.

This decision, according to
Director of the Physical Plant
Grover C. Meetze, was ‘‘based
on the feeling that it is in the
best interest of all concerned
to develop a department of
safety for the College seperate
trom the town.

‘We began to have admini-
strative problems and 1
thought it was iiupertant to

form a separate group,” he
said. ‘‘To keep the needed
authority we had to make a
change.”’

The college force will be
headed by Captain Jackie
Hughes, with its headquarters
in the Precinct #2 building.

These officers will wear
lifferent uniforms and badges
than town officers, and the
Sollege plans to purchase a car
© be used only on the David-
son campus.

All emergency calls will
connect 2: atewn and. the

town force will support the
College force, if needed. This
wilk be the only connection
between the two departments.

The Student Government
Association (SGA) Security
Committee met today to ana-
lyze problem of security en-
countered in the past, and
discuss how these problems
might be connected with the
new system.

The committee stressed the
point that student cooperation
is essential for a successful

eoouwity. opagram. They ° em:

phasized the significance of
student alertness, and the
importance of locking doors
during ball games, big week-
ends, parties, and breaks.

“I would like to think this
will be the beginning of a new
kind of attitude of security to
students and students to secu-
rity,’’ commented Dean of
Students Will Terry.

“Tf we can develop this
program,’ Terry said, ‘‘we can
find enormous benefits. The
security of all of us will be
batten copyed.,”'

tically be put on the waiting
list for that house. For those.
students not receiving their
second or third choices, there
will be a lottery assigning
them to a waiting list.

Each freshman will have the
option of filling out a sheet by
himself of with a group of up
to six people. A group that
runs over a limit in the
selection process will be put
back in the pile if it has
another choice, and if it does
not, it will go to a waiting list.

Asked whether this system
represents an answer for fu-
ture years, Terry replied,
“Nothing dealing with this sy-
stem is eternal. The Council
has really tried to be consci-
entious...but we know that
we're dealing with a large can
of worms.’ The Patterson
Court Council will work with
Terry to- help carry out the
process. Z

Approximately 100 fresh-
men opted not to go through
the selection process last year.
The CCRL has not decided yet
what to do with those upper
classmen who wish to join a
house.

They will not go through the
selection process but will pro-
bably be added to the waiting
lists at some point. Many
houses have already taken
care of their waiting lists from
last year. Terry also hopes to
make special consideration for
the international students
next year.
