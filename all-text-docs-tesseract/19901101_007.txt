Lyle Lovett gave a sterling
performance to a neafly-packed
Love Auditorium. *

Who is Lyle Lovett? He was
born and now resides in Klein,
Texas, where he started his mu-
sic career.

After his firstattemptat form-
ing a band in highschool, Lovett
went on to Texas A&M Univer-
sity where he graduated with a
degree in journalism.

It took many years of playing
solo in bars to develop the unique
style he has today.

His music is mainly of the
country/folk variety with blues and
jazz interspersed toadd depth. Lyle
has released three. albums: Lyle
Lovett (1986),Pondac (1988), and
Lyle Lovett and his Large Band
(1989). Right now he is on a two-
week tour of college campuses to
promote his latestalbum. Davidson
was his first stop.

The concert was a good mix of
older country-western Lovett with
the newer, jazzier songs. Many
people remarked on the absence of
the Large Band which gives Lylea

‘Knows Me” seemed to have a

big, bluesy sound.

However, the acoustic trio
which accompanied Lyle in the
concert was simply awesome.

Acello, bass, anddrums were
justthe rightcombination tocom-
plementLyle’ scrystal clear voice
without overpowering it.

Actually, several songs
which are usually heavy jazz
numbers such as “Here I Am”
sounded great in an acoustic
version.

His country songs such as “If
I Had A Boat”, “L.A. County”,
“This Old Porch”, and ““Nobody

the older members of the audi-
ence.

The more upbeat numbers
like “Once Is Enough”, “What
Do You Do”, the requested
“She’s No Lady”, and the encore
“An Acceptable Level Of Ec-
stasy (The Wedding Song)” were
real crowd pleasers. The really
impressive thing about the con-
cert was that the songs had a
better quality live than in the
recorded versions.

Lyle Lovett and his smaller
acoustic band showed a love for

their musiéfiat- was contagious: 4... 32

Every song had a flair and
polish that was spectacular. When
the concert was over, everyone
knew they had gotten their
money’s worth, but they were
screaming for more.

Lyle Lovett proved himself
to be ahell ofan entertainer, with
an appeal for just about every-
one.

Review / Movie

Postcards Oozes Hollywood Sap

By JOE MARIS

As the year rolls on, and the
calendar marches closerto the next
Academy Awards ceremony, one
can begin to piece together a few
movies shown thus far that might
have a shot at carrying home Os-
cars next year.

Postcards fromthe Edge, based
on the life story of Carrie Fisher
and directed by Mike Nichols (Best
Director 1967,) rises above the
other movies of 1990 for the po-
tential of receiving the most Oscar
nominations.

Simply put, this movie was
made to win Oscar nominations.
Listen to the story line:

Suzanne Vale, played by Meryl
Streep (Best Supporting Actress
1979, Best Actress 1982,) is an
actress. She has a drug problem.
One night, she almost O.D.’s, but
she is brought to a hospital, and a
doctor, played by Richard Dreyfuss
(Best Actor naw
ach.

Then her mother appears. Her
mother is the famous actress Doris

Mann, ited by Shirley Maclaine
(Best Actress 1983). Her mother is
analcoholic. But, Vale hasa direc-
tor friend. He is played by Gene
Hackman (Best Actor 1971). He
helps her find a new lease.on life.
Butcan she cope with her mother?

~ Pay $5.00 and youcan find out
for yourself.

Obviously, this movie is satu-
rated with some of the Academy’s
favorite stars. However, just be-
cause a movie has a plethora of
award-winning stars doesn’t mean
it is an award-winning picture.

Don’t forget that the Academy
nominated Dead Poet' s Society for
Best Picture.

- The biggest problem with
Postcards from. the Edge is that it
completely lacks interesting sub-
ject material.

‘While Nichols does incorpo-
rate some effective directing tech-
niques to establish the various in-

~terpersonal relationships in the

movie, he leaves the movie with-
out much character development.

Mostofthearguments between
Vale and Mann follow this sort of

pattern:

Mother: You do drugs! I had
nothing, but I worked hard to en-
sure that you would have some-
thing. Now you wantto throw itall
away!

Daughter: You are an alco-
holic! Why don’t you just. let me
be? I am an adult now!

And so on, and so on, ad
nauseum.

Vale fights to distinguish,

movie life from real life, Mann
fights old age, and both of them
fight each other.

The ending of the movie at-
tempts to show the result of Vale’s
maturation, but it is so laden with
sap, that it falls flat on its face.

If one likes sappy parent-sib-
ling rivalries based in Holly-
woodesque environments, they
shoulddefinitely go see this movie.

If itis comparative realism that
the moviegoer is after, however,
he should go see Fantasia. The

colors are pretty and the characters .

are more real.

Missing Your Face?

Without A Net
The Grateful Dead
Arista Record

The flies were starting to lay
eggs inthe still bleeding flail marks
that ran the full length of my back.
My mouth was as dry as the sun
that was bubbling the few sections
of uncut skin left on my body. [had
been tied tothe whipping post since
last Monday when I wrote that sad
review of the Allman Brothers’
Seven Turns. Since then Gregg and
Duane had been taking turns mak-
ing me pay--ten lashes for every
sweet slide lick on Eat A Peach.

I was in bad need of someone
to cut me loose and spied a friend
I used to jam with. It was Chuck
Wyrick and when I appealed to
him for aid he said he would send
someone rightaway. An hour later
acouple bears danced up to me but
much to my dismay their lack of
opposing thumbs rendered them
unable to grip the wire cutters they
had brought to free me with. They
danced away and an endless ten
minutes later up walks Jerry Gar-
cia with four guys and a ghost.
“The Candyman’s in town,” he

like I’m dying.”

Without A Net was justin time.
All tracks are recorded live at vari-
ous shows between October, 1989
and April, 1990. There are four-
teen of them and they all show, in
case youdidn’tknow, thatthe Dead
can still do their stuff.

The two disk setis divided into
first and second set with seven
songs in/on each. They are even in
a feasible order for a live show.
The first set is solid but overshad-

“OhLord,”I whimpered,’Tfeel

owed by its roommate in the trippy
cardboard abode, set two. First set’s
“Mississippi Half Step Uptown
(Out-of-Town) Toodeloo” follows
acrisp “Feel Like A Stranger,” but
is missing the extended “Lazy
River” section which is usually the
best part. [It never has worked
without Donna (Godchaux) any-
way.] The crispness of these two
tunes is indicative of the rest of the
album which is conspicuously
devoid of space. “Althea” gets a
special Ed Thiedeman endorse-
ment and the Thiedeman thumb is
up for the rest of the album as well.

The second set I love. Itbegins
with a bouncy “China Cat Sun-
flower” that is really playful but a
little fast to allow the transition
into “I Know You Rider” to be
smooth. Phil saves this one from
drummers Bill Kreutzmann and

‘Mickey Hart (whose fingers must

have been tired from writing his
firstbook, Drumming On the Edge
of Magic) but he still doesn’t get to
sing. Speaking of singing, I hate to
talk dirt on the dead (meaning ac-
tual deceased people) but “Rider”
would have been much better off
without Brent chiming in. If he

- would have. just played it would

have been O.K. but when he opens
his mouth you can’t hear anyone
else. All I can think about when I
hear his voice is his pride and joy,
“I Will Take You Home, ”” also
known as, “I Will Ruin Your
Show.” By any name, it was, and
is, a buzz-kill.

I am told that there are three
factors by which you judge any

Interpreting food labels can be
frustration and confusing, if you
don’t know what to focus on. In-
complete and even misleading
labeling can be found.

Fortunately, legislation is
pending to improve nutrition in-
formation on food labels.

Until then, follow these guide-

lines:
Ingredients are listed in order of
amounts present by weight tin food
from most to least. Pay attention to
the first three ingredients. If you
are trying to limit fat or sodium
(Na), and either is present in the
first three ingredients, look for
more specific information on the
label. You may want to avoid the
product.

Serving size may be misleading.
For example, some cereals list the
serving size as 1/4 cup-much less

- than normally consumed. Note the

serving size first. Re

Fat is one of the most important

ingredients to evaluate in both
quality and quantity. Desirable fats
(low in saturated fat) include saf-
flower, soybean, sunflower, cot-
tonseed, corn, canola, olive, and
peanut oil. Less desirable fats in-
clude lard, palm, and coconut oil,
butter, shortening, and hydrogen-
ated oils (partially hydrogenated
soybean oil is okay). Generally,
food other than meat, cheese, and
fats should contain no more than
five grams of fat per serving.
Choose meat, cheese, and fat prod-
ucts with comparatively low fat

* contents.

Sodium content per serving should
be 400 milligrams or less.

Beware of “words” with no stan-
dard legal definition such as “light,”
“natural,” or “health.” Read the
label further. Think twice about
label health claims. “No choles-
terol” on vegetable oils, marga-
rine, and peanut butter should be
no’ surprise as cholesterol comes
only from foods of animal origin.
