for the National ' Cham-

pionships which will be held in
late August.

Duke University will spon-
sor this year’s conference
climax. The schools will be
supplied with eight Windmills
(six to sail and two for break-
downs); incredibly fast boats,
but with extremely awkward
rigging.

If it weren’t for the ‘‘Mills’’
great speed off the wind and
its ability to pop right up on a
plane, the contortions to which
the crew of two must submit
themselves would not be wor-
thwhile.

Duke hosted a regatta two
weeks ago which would have

pionships

proven to be a great op-
portunity to become familiar
once again with the ‘‘Mills’’
peculiar character, if it
weren't for a 35 mph breeze
that sprang up Saturday mor-
ning.

Due to its perverse nature,
the wind steadily increased
during the postponement - but
the B Division was sent out to
race anyway. Pandemonium
reigned as all but one boat
capsized and most were
damaged.

Daryl Douglas and Tracy
Charles will sail for David-
son’s A Division in the Cham-
pionships and Dave Francis
and d Tommy Lee will sail B.
