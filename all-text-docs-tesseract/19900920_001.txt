Scores Down on 1990
Freshman International
Geography Test

By CHARLES GRIER

Theresults of the International
Awareness test that freshmen took
during orientation are back. The
mean score for the group of 393
was 50.4, down from 56.5 last year.

Although the scores are down
from last year, German and Hu-
manities professor Hansford Epes
believes the results do not neces-
sarily reflect a decrease in aware-
ness.

“T don’t think that the lower
average means a whole lot,” said
Epes. "The test is different and
may have been a little bit harder. I
was kind of appalled that two in-
coming freshmen managed tomake
a 4, which is the lowest score-I
have seen in 9 years. There is no
excuse for freshmen to make be-

low a 12; The highrscore was 92;"»
Students performed better on’ -

the gcographical awareness sec-
tion of the test, compared to previ-
ous years, according to Epes.

“On the map part, relative to 8
and 9 years ago, there is some
evidence that people are coming in
with better knowledge of geogra-
phy. There has been so much

events." Pipe

screaming over geography that it
has effected high schools,” Epes
said.

Even though scores are above
average, the International A ware-
ness Committce will be visiting
with the freshman halls to promote
awareness.

“The International Awareness
committee will have teams of visi«
tors going to freshman halls ex-
plaining why international aware-
hess is important. The visits are
more important than the test,” Epes
said.

Freshman Chris Cobb believes
that involvementin groups suchas
the International Committee will
help increase awareness.

~~ “I’m a member of the Interna-
tional Committee," said Cobb, "so
maybe through that I will get more
people interested in ceneiomet

“Bpastchavedttinl hobo way
for students to become more aware
is by reading newspapers.

“The only thing we have found
to improve awareness is the habit
of reading good newspapers. It

’ should be part of what you should

do everyday,” Epes said. "Every-
day."

Fraternities Violate
Rush Policy

By LISA GERRARD

The month-long wait is over
for freshmen--this weekend they

party on the Court for the first .

time, and Davidson’s seven frater-
nities begin rushing new members.

Students atmostothercolleges
and universities have already be-
gun the rush season, but at
Davidson the process is a little
different.

Oris it? Officially, rush begins
this weekend, butin the pastmonth
the dean’s office has blown the
whistle on what many are calling
“pre-rush” fraternity parties.

“Basically it’s subversive ac-

tivity,” said Dean Will Terry. “It

all comes from the unwillingness —

to just leave freshmen alone for
four weeks, and from the fear of
somebody getting the jump on
them.”

Rush parties during the first
month of school are violations of
Patterson Court policy, butreports
indicate that every fraternity is
breaking the rule in some way.

The parties first attracted the -

administration’s attention a few
days after classes began, when a
so-called pre-rush party in base-
ment Belk got out of hand and the
fire alarm was pulled.

Magazines Praise t the College

By TRENT STEVENS

As if the numerous existing
rankings were not enough, two

‘more publications have reaffirmed

Davidson’s lofty standing among
the nation’s academic powcr-
houses.

This past June, Fortune maga-
zine conducted a survey of 1,891
CEOs of Fortune 500 and Service
500 companies, asking them where
they went tocollege and what they
studied. Out of 1500 replies, three
were from Davidsonalumni. When
the magazine compared the num-
ber of replies received to the aver-_
age size of the graduating class in
the 1950’s, when the majority of
the present CEOs are belicved to
have graduated, Davidson’s result-
ing “Power Factor” was the sev-
enth highest of any. American
school, behind only those of Yale,
Princeton, Washington & Lee,
Harvard, Dartmouth, and North-
western,

The Money Guide , whichis a
special fall issue of Money maga-
zine, took a different tack. The
authors determined how mucheach
school would be expected to cost,

* (42nd),

based on 17 academic portant:
ance measures, and then compared
that figure to its actual cost, disre-
garding possibilities for in-state
tuition breaks and scholarships.
The Money Guide rankings,

‘which divided the 100 top-ranked

public schools from the 100 high-
est-ranked private schools, placed
Davidson in 4 1stplace. According
to their analysis, the highest-ranked
public school is the New College
of the University of South Florida
and Cooper Union is the top-ranked
private school. Some of the other
schools that ranked higher than

Davidson included Bellarmine _

(10th), Duke (29th), Fisk (6th),
Wake Forest (25th) and Meredith
(19th). Some of the schools that
ranked lower included Stanford
Harvard (SOth),
Swarthmore (76th) and Pomona
(69th). However, the authors
emphasized that the college shop-
per should consider many other
criteria: before making a final
choice.

Otherratings, such as those by

Edward B. Fiske and U.S. News

and WorldReport ,alsocater to the
college-bound student. Butas John

Kelton, who is dircctor of Institu-
tional Rescarch and a Psychology
professor, notes, “My gucss is that
very few decisions to attend col-

lege are based on these surveys.”
He adds, “It (a survey) may bring

Davidson to the attention of some

who might not otherwisc know it,

but decisions that students make
about attending are madc on the

basis of more personal, first-hand

information.”

But this view is not totally
unanimous. “Pcople who have becn
herc have their own opinions,” says
Bill Giduz, director of College
Relations. “To pcople who have
not been here, it (a survey) leaves
accrtain impression.”

Despite their inherent draw-
backs, these rankings may have
become a factor in prospective
students’ decisions’ to apply to
schools. According to dean of
admissions Elcanor Payne, such
surveys have a definite impact on
the number of applications for
admission, “Positive articlesabout
the college always gencrate addi-
tional enquirics and interest, which
often are then turned into applica-
tions,” she affirms.
