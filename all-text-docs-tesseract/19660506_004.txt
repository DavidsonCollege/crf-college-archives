FALL TO ABBEY AGAIN

Basemen Split With Citadel

Last Saturday the Wildcat dia-
mondmen met The Citadel Bull-
dogs on “Gnat and Mosquito
Field" in Charleston for a South-
ern Conference doubleheader.
The first game saw Howard Bry-
an, the Big ‘Cat of the mound
staff, handcuff the Bulldog bats
for a 2-0 victory.

Misfortune plagued the ‘Cat
pitchers and batters in the sec-
ond game and they fell. 9-0.

Bryan allowed seven well-
spaced hits and kept the Bull-
dogs off balance at the plate
as he pitched the first shutout by
a Davidson pitcher in three
years. Jim Hyder was three for
four at the plate, and Dick Lind-
sey. Claude Owen and David
King had one hit each.

The Davidson runs were
scored in the fifth inning on
wild pitches by Citadel pitcher
Smitty Holland, who recorded
12 strikeouts against the ‘Cats.

SAD THING

The second game was a sad
thing which saw Henry Wil-
mer run into control trouble in
the third inning and allow four
‘runs after he had pitched well
in the first two innings. His
control trouble might be _at-
tributed to the vicious mos-
quitoes sucking his blood, to the
horrible odor which pervades

all of Charleston or to the sand
blowing in his face.

At any rate, Coach Tom Stev-
ens sent out the call for a fire-
man and Charlie Elliott came
on to retire the side. But the
Bulldogs got two more runs in
the fourth inning and three un-
earned runs in the fifth. El-
liott was finally able to re-
tire the side in, order in the sixth.

The ‘Cats’ bats most of which
were broken in the first game,
had only four hits to contribute—
two by Hyder, and one each
by Lindsey and Jack Smith.
Thus felleth the ‘Cats, 9-0, with
Wilmer being charged with the
loss.

ABBEY BAD NEWS

Tuesday afternoon at David-
son, Belmont Abbey brought
more hard luck to the ‘Cats.
Gene Bennett, who had pitched
well for 8 1/3 innings, suddenly
tired, as did the Davidson de-
fense. The score was tied 3-3
at the start of the inning, but

the Abbey pounded Bennett and 5

reliefer Bryan for eight runs,
which resulted in an 11-3 lead,
and the ball game.

The team managed only three
hits off two Crusader pitchers,
singles by Hyder, Lindsey and
Owen. Coach Stevens expressed
some displeasure at the way the

A LITTLE CONFUSED
Scott Signs With Carolina;
Driesell Looks To May 17

_ “We still expect Charlie Scott to show up at Davidson,” maintained Coach Lefty
Driesell Tuesday night. “He was accepted, signed a grant-in-aid, and put down
$100 as a binder. We just think’s a little confused, but we expect him to come here.

mour running the 880, Bobby
Myers and Johnny Flowers in
the 440, and Andy Little in the
3 mile.

Coach Whittle said that he
thought Hill would do well in
both his events. He also men-

tioned that the mile relay team -

had a chance to pick up some
points.

When asked about the fresh-
men, Whittle’s outlook changed
considerably. ‘‘We should have
a much stronger team next year
with right much depth. Several
of these boys are really going
to help us out,"’ he commented.

He especially cited Greg Cox
in the jumps, Charlie Cam-
eron and Mike Thornton in the
sprints, Tony Orsbon and Eddie
Rice in the 440, Randy Phillips
in the milé and 2 mile. Mike
Moats in the 880 and George
Rogister in the hurdles.

In the field events, Whittle
noted the performance of Roane
Cross and Tom Baker in the
shot, Cross, Kerry Keith, and
Wayne Huckel in the javelin
and Bill Bryan in the discus.

To date the team holds a 2-3
record, with victories over
North Mecklenburg High School
and Carolina Military Academy,

ers Park and Gardner-Webb.

demanded immediate improve-
ment. He said, “We just’ give
too many ball games away. We
kill ourselves much more than
the other team ever could.”

FULL WEEKEND AHEAD

This weekend the ‘Cats travel
to West Virginia to take on the
Mountaineers, a team with an
overall batting average of .322,
and four hitters batting over
.300.

They also have a good RBI
man in centerfielder Don Hetzel
and two good pitchers in Vaughn
Kovach (ERA: 0.32) and Jerry

’ ~~

Meadows (ERA: 2.29). They are

‘always tough, but, oddly enough,

they have not scored a lot of
runs this year.

On Monday the team goes to
William and Mary to play the
Indians in the ‘Cats’ final road
appearance of the year. The In-
dians are second in the confer-
ence and have surprised a lot of
people this year.

Coach Stevens has expresesd
the fear that a shortage of man-
power could hurt the team on a
long trip like this, but the "Cats
are going to bow their necks and
try to improve their 4-6 con-
ference mark.

The Citadel and the University

sixth place with 49, followed
by the College of Charleston
with 29. .

Yates Fletcher, took two sec-
ond places, one third, two
fourths and a fifth. Skipper
Chip Robertson and crew Chip
Bellamy finished first three
times, second once and third
twice in the B Division.

Chip Robertson said that the
Davidson team has by far the
best record of any team in the
Association. This was the first
meet that the ‘Cats have not
walked away with, and in this
case they were “just pushed
out.” He added that home wa-

ed the Old Dominion chances.

All day tomorrow the ‘Cats
will host the S.A.LC.S.A. Sin-
gle-Hand Championships at Lake

sent the Association at the na-

the six competitors in the as-

formances, Davidson has two in
competition for the champion-
ship.

Golfers Eye Championship

By CLIFF DUKE
Davidsonien Sports Writer -

On Sunday the Wildcat golf-
ers will embark for North Car-
olina’s golfing paradise, South-
ern Pines, in quest of the
school’s fourth conference cham-
pionship. Every conference
member. including the recently
added East Carolina Pirates,
will furnish six golfers for two
days of medal play.

The teams will compete over
the 7,000 yard long Country Club =
of North Carolina. This tough
course will demand long hitting
to break its par of 72. Dr. Tom
Scott, who coaches the golf
squad in addition to his duties
as Athletic Director, said, “I'll
wager we won't see many sub-
par or par rounds.”

From the top ten places of
a year ago, six men will return
to tee up on Tuesday morning.

This fact, however, does not
establish the Wildcats as pre-

“I haven't seen West Virginia,
and the only comparison is that
we beat GW 4-3, and they beat
them 6-1. But we've played
this course before and they
haven't.”

The golfers will play practice
rounds on Monday. Starting time
for the first foursome on Tues-
day—the first day of competi-
tion—will be 9 a. m. The
groups are arranged on the
basis of their average scores
and team ranking as submitted
by each school. Six men are
entered, and at the end of the
two rounds each school counts
the scores of its lowest four
men.

Jelks plays number one, and
is averaging only 73 strokes per
round. McKeever, Champ Cov-
ington, Johnny Giles, George
Leight and George Brewer fill
out the line-up, with Walter
Daniels the alternate. Covington
and Leight are the second and
third low scorers, although
Leight has participated in only
three matches.

CONSISTENCY CITED
Dr. Scott commented that
“George has been hitting the

ball well, even though basket-
ball kept him out of several
matches. Everyone, though, is
capable of playing good golf.
They have played ‘consistently,
and we have faced mostly ACC
teams. Giles and Brewer had
a bad spurt, but they’re com-
ing up now.

“It is good that they play
consistent. golf. The best thing
that can happen to you is to have
all your golfers bunched up alt-
er the first day. That way you
have a better chance to win
more team points, and not have
to depend on one or two men.”

Jelks reiterated Dr. Scott's
confidence in the Wildcats’

chances. “We're pretty confi-
dent. Of course, we don’t know
how tough West Virginia is, but
I think everyone is hitting the
ball well.”

PASADENA NEXT STOP

Giles voiced the same opin-
ion, and added, “Everyone is
looking forward to this. The
winner will get to go to Pasa-
dena, Cal., for the NCAA cham-
pionships.”

With this goal before them,
the Wildcats seek their first title
since 1960. They have placed
second twice in the dry spell
since then. They also captured
the crown in 1954 and 1958.
