Dunn Talks On Vietnam
At Davidsonian Banquet

“J do not know why we are
in Vietnam.” said J.A.C. Dunn,
reporter for The Charlotte Ob-
server Tuesday at the annual
DAVIDSONIAN banquet in the
Wildcat Room. Presented at the
same time was the David Grier
Martin Award for the outstand-
ing beginning reporter.

In recognition of his notable
writing this year. Franklin An-
derson received the award from
Sam Boyte, editor of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN. Anderson, who is
now assistant managing. editor.
has written many articles, in-
cluding the coverage of the ban
on the playing of ‘Dixie’ at
football games this year which
received recognition in several
area newspapers.

“You always forget what Viet-

nam looks like—how big it is... |

and how small it is." said Dunn
as he began by passing around
a map of the country.

Making his own position clear.
he explained. "I don't know if
we are winning. I don't know
whether. we can win. I person-
ally am neither for nor against
the war in Vietnam.”

Dunn said that a judgment
cannot be made because the war
is “too big for one human brain
to comprehend.’’ The people of
Vietnam are aware of 500.000
people ‘either killing or build-
ing.’ but they are unable to
grasp it.

One of the distinguishing char-
acteristics of the war in Viet-
nam is the lack of a front line.
“You can walk the length of the
country and live. or step out on
your doorstep and die.” Dunn
remarked.

Of the 400-odd correspondents
in Vietnam, approximately one-
fourth leave Saigon. ‘People
who go somewhere else do not
travel by road. If you travel,
you travel by plane.” An accred-
ited correspondent can travel
anywhere by plane without pay-
ing fare.

Those who do not travel “sit
there in Saigon and take the
handouts.”’ which is the reason
for the preponderance of Saigon

Cause $150 Damage

Davidson students were re
sponsible for $150 damage as ap
proximately. 300 turned out for
the traditional Thursday night-
before Spring Frolics celebration
at Hattie’s on April 13.

Proprietress Hattie Morgan
reported that the students broke
a neon sign. smashed several
Windows, pulled down a fence
and. knocked holes in the ceiling
of the poptlar beer outlet. With
her. beer license’ up for renewal
soon. she was disturbed by the
possibility that the incident
might place that renewal in
jeopardy.

A complaint was issued by her
with Dean of Students Richard
C. Burts. but as yet no other
complaints have been filed with
the dean's office or with the
State Alcoholic Beverage Con-

trol Board in Charlotte.

In an interview with THE DA-
VIDSONIAN Burts stated that
the administration did not plan
to take any action concerning

the incident. He did express the} Pfitzner. James M. Reinoehl,! (Continued From Page One) ‘lar paper on Pakistan that they

tion demonstrated that they |
were not aware of the delicate:
conditions under which a beer

commented that the student be
havior was a bad reflection up !
on the school.

Student Body President. Tom
Earnhardt and several. other
campus leaders circulated a
leaflet early last week informing
students of the aggravaied sit
uation and calling for more re-
sponsible student behavior.
Earnhardt was out of town,
however. and could not be reach
ed for further comment. |

session, known as the “five
o'clock follies.” is always well
attended.

At the “follies.” the briefer
speaks very rapidly. The re-
porter’s game is ‘“‘get the brief-
er,”’ Dunn said. “‘“Game. set, and
match is when you trap the
briefer into telling you how
roany people were killed.’ Ac-
cording to Dunn, the only reli-
able casualty data is that “‘peo-
ple are, killed and wounded.”

The press {is well treated by
the military, and briefings with
General Westmoreland or Am-
bassador Lodge are secured with
little difficulty. ““When you want
a briefing with the CIA, it’s a
lot harder.’ Dunn added.

There is no censorship wy the
military or the Vietnamese on

press and the incoming mail are
censored. Dunn noted. “They

don't show it.”

Dorm Council Report

President D. Grier Martin will
receive a briefing on the propos-
ed Residence Hall Association
Monday.

Mrs. Peter Nicholls, supervis
or of dormitories, will explain
the functioning of the associa-
tion to Martin at that time.

The groundwork is being laid
for the inception of the dorm
organization possibly by the
opening of school next year.

Approved this week by the
Student Council. the associa-
tion’s constitution defines all

ny dents who reside in the resi-

dence Halls as members of the
association. These students will:
elect a president in the spring |
when the Social Council presi.

dent and president of the Stu. '

dent Union are elected.

The primary legislaiive bodv
of the organization, the Resi-
dence Hall Council. will consist

of representatives elected from —

each dorm.

The only change in existing

dormitory regulations will be the
additien of rules concerning the
opening of dormitories to wom-
en visitors during certain hours.

during the same period. Spen-
der and Auden had become
friends at University College,
Oxford, where they were both
undergraduates at the same
time.

Later, all three men associat-
ed themselves with a strongly
anti-Fascist attitude during the
1930°’s. Spender went to Spain
where he took the side of the
Spanish Republic during the
Civil War,

Since 1947, Spender has made
frequent visits to the United
‘States. He has taught at Sarah
Lawrence College, the. Univer-
sity of Cincinnati, the University
of California and Northwestern
University.

As a critic of tne literary
scene, Spender holds that the
visual arts show a type of mod.
ernity that the more tradition-
ally-oriented literary arts do not
show.

Auden is also a chronicler of
the current writers for the new
English theater, as well as the
young poets such as Philip Lar-

kidded the Davidsonian photog.
rapher who was taking his pic-
ture.

“Of the 12 living religions of
the day.” he said, ‘‘all but 1
claim that there is a truth. Bud-
dha was still searching when he
died,”

There are several ways. of
looking at truth as a quality
proposition, according to Shin-
nock. One can look at the life of
Christ to determine His authen-
ticity and consistency.

First. he said, the deeds of
Jesus such as associating with
the leper and cleansing him, and
His walking on the water prove
that He knew His identity, and
the knowledge of these deeds
proves His identity to us.

Second, to those who say that
Christ was “a nut."’ Shinnock
answered: ‘‘My best friend at
UCLA was a Jew. He would
say that Christ was the greatest
teacher and man that ever lived.
Christ did too many loving deeds
to be called a maniac.”

Third, the Christian religion is
consistent, he said. “I discov-
ered Christ in my freshman year
at UCLA. Before I had believed
in Him in the head. but not in
the heart and soul.”

Shinnock cited as an example
of conversion Lew Wallace. He
was working on a book with
Robert Green Ingersoll that was
to disprove Christianity. By the
third chapter. however, Wallace
had found Christ. and he later
wrote Ben Hur.

; it’s H | t possible that Happenings haven’t reached your campus
| sient. l yet. Be assured they will because Happenings are the big-

gest college craze since mononucleosis.

A Happening, in case you don’t know, is the first form-

less art form. Things just happen. For example, eighty

naked men come out and squirt each other. with fire hoses
containing tinted yogurt. Then eighty more naked men
come out and light birthday candles in the navels of the
first eighty men. Then one girl, clothed, comes out and
pulls three thousand feet of sausage casing through her
pierced ear. Then eighty more naked men come out and
eat a station wagon.

There is, of course, a musical accompaniment to all
these fun things. Usually it is “Begin the Beguine,’ played
by 26 trench mortars, a drop forge, and a rooster.

There used to be, some years ago, still another require-
ment for becoming a hippie: a man had to have a beard.

But no longer. Beards were worn in the past not so
much as a protest, but because shaving was such a painful
experience. Then along came Personna Super Stainless
Steel Blades.

Today if you don’t want to shave, well, that’s your
