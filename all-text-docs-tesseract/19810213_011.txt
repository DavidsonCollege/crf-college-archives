Black perspectives

(Continued from page 1)

“Of the 31 black males here
now, 24 play sports.”

“I think we need Black
athletes but we need students
who aren’t involved.in sports as
well,” Parker added.

Mingo felt that while black
athletes may remain in their
own groups, this is not a

problem limited specifically to

Blacks.

“This isn’t just a Black
phenomenon. White athletes
stick together, too.”

Several of the panelists ad-
mitted that they often felt
uncomfortable because of their
small numbers.

‘‘Sometimes you feel like
you're somebody's education.
We are constantly on display,
and I think we get tired of being
our education,” Mingo said.

Freshman Harriett Gaston

“T realized when I came as a
prospective student that it
wasn’t going to be easy.”’

_“T do feel uncomfortable so-
metimes, especially at mixers.
Because of the small number of
Blacks you realize you’re meet-
ing people just for friends.”’

Silvia Navarro-Jimene of
Spain asked if Black students

felt they had the same oppor-

tunities as whites in the job
market.

Parker replied, ‘‘I think I do.
Coming from Davidson will help
a lot. A Black. student from.
Davidson has a better chance of
getting a job in many areas then
a student from a majority black
college.

‘‘There are those who say
that we’ll have an easier time
getting into law schools for
example, than whites. That’s
not. true.-”

“For one thing we don’t have

the contacts that white stu- |

dents do. In this sense I do feel

I have to work harder to gat a

job than ‘a white guy.”

Harriett Holshuijsen of Hol-
land asked if Blacks ‘tended to
remain in one group tt David-
son.

Walker. said. “We do have a”

tendency to stick together,
mainly because we need to be
around others with the same
problems.”

Mingo felt that Blacks should
not avoid contact with whites.

“There’s a danger of alienat-
ing ourselves from the rest of
the student body. Where we get
to the outside world, in law,
business, or medicine, this is
the way its going to be. We’ve
got to get used to it.”

’ Amr el Kadi, an Egyptian,
asked if Blacks felt any ties to
Africa.

“I think unless you are well
read you have a hard time
identifying with Africans,’ said
senior Terry Knox.

“There is some distance be-
tween American Blacks and
Africans but I can’t deny that
there is some connection.
Myths such as Black masculini-
ty and so forth perhaps could be
traced to old views of Africans
the way white society views
us.”

“Yet I think the Afro-Ameri-

can has a hard time identifying
with white America. Africa is a
very rich historical background
for us, a sort of Motherland.
Africa doesn’t provoke the idea
of oppression as America has so
naturally there is an attrac-

tion.’

Navarro-Jimene asked if the
students felt any feelings of
hostility around them.

Parker said ‘‘I don’t feel

- there’s any hostility but there is

a lot of pressure on me when I’m
the only Black in a classroom of
whites to bring: ‘the Black
peispectve. "

Mingo agreed. We're indivi.
duals. We don't represent all

Black

spielen asked if any of
one Blacks. ‘when they ven-
tured outside of their peer
group.

“We're here as a group of 46
out of 1300,” said Parker. “‘We
can’t avoid the rest of David-

-son ”

Knox said, ‘‘I don’t think
there is any explicit pressure
but interracial dating, for
example, is difficult. Being a
fairly conservative place it
doesn’t occur that often.” —

“In this respect Davidson is.a
microcosm of society in general.
There is some interracial dating
yet, while there is nq, pressure
that it is wrong, many don’t feel
comfortable with it.’’

Asked what advice she would
give to Blacks coming to David-
son in the future. Mingo said ‘‘I

_ would tell them to be strong and

not to lose themselves here.”

Knox agreed that it is impor-
tant that Blacks not lose their
sense of identity at Davidson.

“‘When I left to spend a year
at Howard University in Wash-
ington I felt disillusioned about
Davidson. I felt I was losing
myself in the Davidson exper-
ence; I was living assimulated.
But I didn’t want to lose my
Black identity.”

“While I didn’t leave just to
be immersed in Blackness, Ho-
ward was one of the best
experiences of my life. There
were competent Black profes-
sors there as role models.
Courses were taught giving the
role of. blacks in history, for
example. From this I was able
to see what can be done at

Davidson.”
Responding to how Davidson

could better meet the needs of

Black student, Dockery said,

“We need more Black students

here to achieve a critical mass.”

‘The problem is that the
Black Scholar is in high demand
right now. Finding qualified
students is a problem.”

“There is also the problem
of Davidson’s image as an
ultra-conservative, lily white
institution.”’

“This will change with time,
but, to make life here more
tolerable for Black students, we
need greater numbers.”

Dockery cited administration
awareness of the problem as
cause for hope.

‘The administration. has
made a committment to in-
creasing the number of blacks
here. We are doing a great deal
of work now on the Committee
on Minorities in terms of infor-
mation gathering.”

“The whole situaton of think-
ing Black-White is distress-
ing,’’ Dockery said. ‘‘Once you
accept that, though, the impor-
tant question is what can be
done to foster the notion that
these differences are superficial.
How does one get beyond
physical skin color? Shared
experience is the only way.”

“The situation here is transi-
tory and circumstantial,’’ he
added. ‘‘Many problems for
Blacks are due to history and
not specific obstacles. Again,
it’s a matter of changing David-
son’s image.”’

“There is a problem of
equating minorities with insig-
nificance. A group’s signifi-
cance cannot be judged by its
size,” he said.

Mary Thornberry said Reagan
wilf modify Carter's proposals
to conform to the Republican
platform.

According to The Chronicle of
Higher Education, the Reagan
Administration indicated. that
GSLs ‘‘will be one of the prime
targets of their efforts to cut
federal spending.’’ Thornberry
said Reagan’s speech on the
economy Thursday night
should specify the programs to
receive budget cutbacks.

Stevenson suggested that
concerned students write their
congressmen about the future of
the GSLs program.
