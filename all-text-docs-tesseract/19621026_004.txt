_ The Department of the Army has armounced that
it will accept a limited number of non-ROTC graduates
for enlistment in the United States Army Security Agency
Reserve and language training at the United States Army
Language School in Monterey, Calif.

Enlisting as a private under

the college graduate will com-
plete eight weeks of basic train-

and ing, followed by comprehensive
istudy of a European. language.

Upon completion of the study,
which includes history and cus-
toms of the country, the grad-
uate will then complete the re-
maining portion of the six year
reserve obligation in the 297th

ment in the post-Homecoming audience.

In little time Jonas exhibited
his sly delight in making the
government of the Democrats
damn themselves by their own
words. After both blunt and
painfully satiric remarks, a
definite portion of the audience
erupted with wild applause.

Others, later identified only
as A-students in economics,
were heard mumbling some-
thing about a “cross of gold.”
Obviously incomplete, Jonas’
speech ended with the bell, but

1a few of the students heard it
_begin again at the coffee and
continue along the path to his
car.

He had said, “I am willing
to bankrupt the nation for
national defense.” Suddenly,
this fragment of his own mood
of fiscal generosity became
relevant; it may force Jonas
to revamp a campaign prev-
iously focused on national
monetary irresponsibility.
Everywhere Jonas appealed

to the instructive belief that he
who values money lightly will
soon have’ none to value; he
must now consider the reaction
of his constituents to the threat

communications practices.

To qualify for the program,
students must be Seniors or
must be the recipient of a
bachelor’s degree; men with
prior military service and those
in Advanced ROTC are not eligi-
ble.

Students interested in this
program should contact Cap-
tain D. H. Threlkeld in the
ROTC Department. Seniors
should see Capt. Threlkeld as
soon as possible.

The Cuban crisis and the
voters’ worry may well re-
duce the problems of the local
textile industry to near ir:
relevancy; the people may
make a more subjective choice
of representative than they
have done previously.

What, then, can Jonas do to
counter sympathy for a Demo-
erat if that sympathy seems to
rally the voters to his opponent?
He, too, can only hope, pray,
and shake hands, because this
crisis is not the first in his eam-
paign.

Congressional district and left
him a constituency half of
which had never witnessed his
campaigns.

So that he would have the
time to effectively cover these
new areas, Jonas planned an
intense schedule for the first
weeks after the adjournment of
Congress. Into October, how-
ever, “biased and inept leader-
ship” compelled Congress -to
remain in session that it might
complete its business.

Now there is time for only
the most superficial campaign-
ing, and Jonas has to hope that
Mecklenburg County will not

King.

| Among the youn le being graduated fron
college in these times, there are some who thinl
and feel—perhaps a little more deeply than the
others—about the world we live in, the future
; we face. They ask, “How can I make my career
' really meaningful? More than just personally

rewarding?”

And many of today’s most successful young
deople are finding a fulfilling answer to these
questions as officers on the Aerospace Team...
the United States Air Force. They can tell you
that no career could better combine the oppor-
tunity for achievement—and the deep inner

satisfaction of knowing that they are helping
preserve the very future of America.

How can you become an Air Force Officer?

If you are a college senior and not currently
enrolled in ROTC, Air Force Officer Training
School provides an opportunity

a wide variety of career fields.
this three-month course receives a commission
as a second lieutenant. As the Air Force
continues its technological advance, officers
with college training will move into positions
of increasing importance.
