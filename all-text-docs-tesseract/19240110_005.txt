Outstanding Productions
Booked During Spring

McCain Announces Varied Program
of Pictures for Students

The pictures that the Y. M. C. A. has
booked for showing this spring exhibit a
wide range of theme and treatment. Among
them are some of the best pictures obtainable
at any price and the general tone of the pic-
tures this spring will be as good as that in
the best theatres in the country.

The outstanding productions that will have
a place on the spring schedule are:

First, “Scaramouche,” the much-talked-of
Metro feature that was directed by Rex In-
gram. Ingram also directed “The Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse,” the sensation
of. several years ago, but this picture is said
to eclipse even this stupendous production in
power of theme and brilliance of presenta-
tion. “Scaramouche” stars the beautiful
Alice Terry and the new leading man, Ramon
Navarro. It was only through a streak of

luck that the Y. M. C. A. was able to se-
cure this picture at this time.

Another outstanding feature of — the
spring's, entertainment is “Enemies — of
Women,” by Blasco Ibanez, adapted to the

screen by

principal

Goldwyn-Cosmopolitan. The
Alma and
Lionel Barrymore, and the picture was film-
ed in Paris. It is heralded as a stellar pro-
duction in every sense of the word.

actors are Reubens

Mary Roberts Rinehart, probably the most
popular woman writer in the world, is the
author of “Long Live the King.” This novel
was one of the best sellers of the year and

as a picture it makes by far the most pow

erful vehicle that the diminutive star, Jackie
Coogan, has ever had.
There haye been many requests for pic-

tures made by Viola Dana, This demand

will be met this spring by the Deen ition of

several of her pictures, The fir st, “Rouged

Lips,” will be shown here this week.

Other pictures scheduled inelude “The
Steadfast Heart.” Buster Keaton’s latesi;
Hospitality.” and Harold Lloyd in “Why
Worry?” At every time, when the length
of the feature will permit, there will be

comedies and other interesting features.

Efforts are being made to provide ade-
quate seating arrangements for the
this spring, and the Y. M. C. A. hopes to
have some good seats soon,

Viola Dana Saturday
In “Rouged Lips”
Miss Dana Stars in § in Screen Adapta-

tion of Rita Weiman’s
“Uustage”

Saturday night Viola Dana will be seen in
her newest Metro picture, “Roughed Lips,”
a story of the stage and stage people from
Rita Weiman’s story, “Upstage.” It

is a

picture that gives Miss Dana an excellent |

opportunity to display her vivacious charm
an{l extraordinary talent. Miss Weiman, the

author, is thé most delightful of all chroni- |

clers of life behind the footlights and her
stories have won millions of readers,

Supporting Miss Dana is a superlative cast
of players. At the head is Tom Moore,
famous in his own right and thrice famous
as a brother of two other noted Moores,
Owen and Matt. In the cast also are Nola
Luxford, Sydney de Grey, Arline Pretty,
Francis Powers, Georgie Woodthorpe, and |
Burwell Hamrick.

“Rougher Lips” is the story of a little girl |

who is a member of a musical comedy |
chorus. She meets her Prince Charming
who recognizes her innate sweetness and in-
nocence but who is led astray by false!
rumors and fails to realize the secret wishes |
of every woman’s heart. In the end Norah
wins her Prince Charming, but how she
succeeds in doing it against terrific obstacles |
forms as interesting a story as the local
theatres have ever presented. It was di-!
rected by Harold Shaw from the scenario
by Thomas J. Hopkins and photographed by
John Arnold.

One of the most interesting features of
“Roughed Lips” is a devil’s chorus of
“thirty under twenty.” This expression has
become famous in theatrical circles and sig-
nifies a collection of beautiful girls, perhaps
thirty in number and all under twenty vears
of age. In “Rouged Lips” several of the big
scenes are laid inside of a theatre with the
performance in full progress before an au-
dience. This chorus was picked out cf hun-
dreds of California beauties.

Admission 15c and 25c.. “Bring a : hair.”

Dr. and Mrs. Harding spent a few days
last week with their daughters Mrs. Mc-
Geachy and Mrs. Brenizer, of Charlotte.

Sigma Upsilon Chapter
Due Credit for Work

Since Organization as Blue Pencil
Club Literary Work Here Has
Been Bettered

The January issue of the “News Letter.”
publication of Sigma Upsilon National Lit-
erary Fraternity, has a story of the history
of the Blue Pencil chapter, located at David-

son. The following is a summary of the
article :
On January 18, 1915, seven men met and

formed the Blue Pencil Club to promote lit-
erary work, At this meeting a committee
Was appointed for seeking affiliation with
Sigma Upsilon Literary Fraternity. The
charter was granted the following April and

the Blue Pencil chapter was installed May
10, 1915,
Ever since the organization was formed

it has been very active. In 1915, upon the
invitation. of Odd Number chapter, of the

University North Carolina, Blue Pencil
chapter entered a short story written by G.
W. Gignilliat, in the Sigma Upsilon conest.
Mr. Grgnilliat won the Sigma Upsilon prize
for 1915.

In the beginning meetings were held
monthly, but since 1917 they have been held
fortnightly, The programs have consisted
partly of critical work and partly of original
work, At every meeting several papers are
read and general discussion of current topics
takes place.

In addition to its regular work in the
meetings, Blue Pencil has done much to
promote literary work throughout the stu-
dent body. Every effort is made to keep in
touch with the work of the ‘“Davidsonian,”
the “Magazine,” and “Quips and Cranks.”
Membership is determined largely by con-
tributions to the publications and by interest
in the work of the literary societies and
Dramatic club.

Besides these activities the chapter has
taken part in bringing lecturers on literary
topics to the college. Included in these are
Vachel Lindsay, Dr. Metcalf, and Professor
;Lomax. They have also co-operated with |
the librarian in collecting books written by
Davidson men, |

For the past two years Blue Pencil has |
worked very closely with the Dramatic club. |
Last year a study of the one-act play was
made and much of the original work was in
dramatic form. Several plays, written by |
its members, have been presented lately.

E, J. Erwin, Professor of English here, |
is national president of Sigma Upsilon.

The Blue Pencil roll includes the follow- |
ling active and associate members :

LIBRARY NEWS

———EEE |
| Two new books have recently been)
added to the Davidson College library, |
both of which were written by alumni.)
| One of these is by Dr. Edward Mack,
'86, professor in the department of}
Hebrew and Old Testament Interpreta- |
tion at Union Theological Seminary,
Richmond, Va. This work is entitled
The Preacher’s Old Testament. The
book tells in a very interesting way the
historical and literary value of the Bible,
its moral influence upon the world, and
how it prepared the Jewish nation for
| the coming of the Christ.

| The other is by Dr. W. S. Plumber
Bryant, ’75. Its title is Prayer and the
Healing of Disease. A very striking con-
trast is made, in this book, between the
old and the new classes of miracles.
Dr. Bryant shows how fakirs have
shaken the faith of many people in this
age.

Fire Hazard Eliminated
By Building Fire Escapes

Safety of Students Enhanced -by
‘New Additions to Shearer Hall

Steps are being taken to reduce to the

least possible degree the hazard of life
caused by fires at Davidson College. Closely
on the heels of the installation of night

watchmen have followed improvements on
Shearer Hall that will be completed within
the next few days. Upon the completion of
these improvements, this old building, a gift
from our late president, J. B. Shearer, to
Davidson College, will be rendered far less
dangerous in case of fire.

These improvements, made under — the
supervision of D, B. Van Sant, engineer of
buildings and grounds, consists of modern
a width of three feet that
extend from the second floor to the ground
on the north and south sides of the building.
At present the fire escapes are completed
except the protecting rail that will he
put in place within the next few days. Mr.
Van Sant says that plans are being completed
to convert the windows at the landings of the
fire escapes into doors that will comply with
the state laws. 9 This
will provide two other three-foot exits from
the auditorium.

as entrances and exits

The days in which Old Shearer will be
considered «nothing more than fire trap
seem to be dying a slow death, With the
addition of the two fire escapes there will
be four large exits from the auditorium of
the building. This arrangement will supply
sufficient room to allow the entire student
body to pass out of the building in a com-
paratively short time, and, coupled with the
fact that escape from the ground floor
already will render ungrounded any
fear of hazard of life from fires in Shearer
Hall in the future.

For centuries before Franklin flew his kite

about the nature of lightning. With elec-

the laboratory and the stupendous phenom-
