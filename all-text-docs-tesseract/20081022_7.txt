Victims; Dozens Are Frat-less
Kappa Alpha party out of hand; house under water

In the wake of the most punish-
ing Hurricane Hugo party to ever
hit the Kappa Alpha Order, SGA
officials have yet to respond with
adeqaute relief efforts.

The storm made landfall at ap-
proximately 9:45 p.m. Friday night,
assaulting the house with gale-force
winds and a torrential downpour of
Busch Light. Although the SGA
has promised to send hovercrafts
with food, fuel, and construction
supplies to the partially submerged

Strikers Write

A year after the Writers Guild
of America went on strike, a shock-
ing number of mine strikers have
taken up writing.

The concensus among the min-
ers is that someone has to do the
writing, despite its challenges.

“Don’t get me wrong, writing
500 words-a-day from home over
the New York Times crossword and
a nice latte isn’t easy, but someone
has to do it,” says Earl Savage,
former president of the Bluefield

Student Forgets to

Michael Seymore ’11 has done
it again. After describing his sec-
tion of a study guide in three un-
necessarily long paragraphs, Mi-
chael simply sent the email without
attaching the appropriate docu-
ments. Fellow students noted he
was seriously embarrassed as he
sent a follow-up email two min-

Michael Seymore ’11, moron.

fraternity, no help has yet arrived.
When Lennea Buttermore came

‘Monday morning for her weekly

house cleaning evaluation, she re-
alized the extent of the damage.

“There was nothing left to eval-
uate. The house had no windows,
ceilings, or doors. I had to give
them a 14,” she said.

In the void of any leadership,
looters have ransacked the kitchen,
while bandits made off with the TV
and several composites. Surviving
brothers have taken to canoeing
through the basement, looking for
lost pledge brothers.

Aside from sending a box of
umbrella bags, the SGA President
Greene has yet to react to what may
become the most difficult challenge
he faces in office. Last at KA for
an informal Wednesday night party
several weeks ago, Greene’s aloof-
ness has raised questions about
how “in touch” he actually is with

Minors Union, now working on
his second novel, a sweeping pe-
riod piece. For many, penning hai-
kus and memoirs has proved gritty
work.

“Do I miss risking roof collapse
and gas explosions during 12-hour
work days for minimum wage.
Of course. But I’ve got to pay the
bills.” Savage says he may some-
day return to mining, but for now
he’ll keep writing.

“Just the other day I told my
son, ‘Boy, the world needs writers

too.’ I just hope he’s not ashamed.”

Attach Attachment

utes later with the subject heading,
“Wait, I’m a moron.”

Michael is what social pscholo-
gists refer to as a “detacher.” By
failing to attach his document as
planned, he has also alienated him-
self from an increasingly email-
savvy society.

The sophomore Classics major
is a technologically troubled indi-
vidual. He also sends Youtube vid-
eos without clickable links, refers
to the internet as “cybertown,” and
thinks WiFi is the genre his Star
Trek DVDs fall into.

Due to his inability to recognize
that other members of his Club Bad-
minton don’t care about his dinner
plans with “Jimbo,” Michael also
has been labeled a severe abuser of
the “reply to all” button.

He has since been removed
from the Club Badminton email
list.

Finally, it has happened. Since
freshman year I’ve been petition-
ing student deans, club leaders,
and really anyone that wouldn’t hit
me when I suggested it, for the one
thing that could skyrocket my start
to a day at Chambers. Free bagels
and juice? Not a chance. Someone
falling into a dunk tank? I don’t
succumb to childish laugh tactics.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I’m talking
about the Umbrella Bags ®.

One of the 35 umbrella bag stands
located throughout Chambers.

Never before has man been able
to manage the paradoxical situation
of a wet umbrella in a dry setting.
But now, with the best use of our
tuition money that this school has
seen in years, Davidson College’s

SGA Ignores Hurricane Hugo Opinion: Umbrella Bags ®

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2008 7

has directed us to the Mecca of wa-
ter residue safety.

When my umbrella slips effort-
lessly into that clear plastic sheath,
I breathe easy. The scoreboard
reads:

Steve: 1, Nature: 0.

Besides, the normal match-
ing covers that all umbrellas come
with usually fall apart after one
use. Also, the way they match the
umbrella can make you look pre-
tentious. These Umbrella Bags®
are light and great for travel, but
probably the greatest part is that
the mass quantities at every door of
Chambers notifies me that I can use
and dispose of three a day without
worrying about finding a new one.
Furthermore, since they’re not bio-
degradable, every rodent seeking
shelter in your local landfill now
has a new home providing an un-
obstructed yet protective view to
the outside world.

So this is really about match-
ing your needs with that of those
in your surroundings. Please, kind
citizens, use an Umbrella Bag®,
and give back to your community.
