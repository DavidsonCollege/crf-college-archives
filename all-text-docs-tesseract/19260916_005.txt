Absence of Black
Dims Team’s Hopes

Wildcat hopes for a 1926 state football
championship received a rather severe jolt
when it was announced last week that Wick
Black, back years and
captain of last year’s eleven, is suffering
from Jober pneumonia.

varsity for three
This announcement
of Black's condition came asa shock to the
student body who had hoped the ex-captain
would be seen back in harness.

At the last report Wick was getting along
very well and his doctors said there was a
| possibility of his playing in the last two
games of the season, but Wildcat backers
are not pinning too much faith on this an-
nouncement.

This year would have been Black's fourth
jas a varsity player, and he is the oldest
Wildeat player in regard to experience. This
veteran's place will be hard to fill capably,
although there are many promising aspirants.
Men who can smash a line on the offense and
back it up on the defense as Black did are
few and far between.

Black came to Davidson straight from Da-
vidson High School and ever since his face
has been a familiar one to sports followers
throughout the state. He has always been
dependable and led last season’s team through

a most successful season,

Yes, Black will be missed and Wildcat fans
are wishing him a speedy recovery and that
he may be able to get into the Carolina and
Duke games and wind up his already splendid
