Stavrides Instructs Students
In Study Of Okinawan Karate

By DAVID MELTON
Asst. Sports Editor

Pete Stravides is a_ very
traditional person, and he
teaches a very traditional sport.
Shorin-Ryu Okinawan Karate.

Three times a week. Tuesday
and Thursday nights and Sun-
day afternoons, Stavrides
meets with his class of ten to fif-
teen pupils in order to train his
students in the art of karate.

Stavrides noted that “The
course is designed in such a way
as to prepare the students tor
promotion to their tirst rank ot

karate, the green belt, by the
end of April.”

Keith Bowen, Gray Robinson
and Jack Barbour, among
other, are some of the students
who are making great progress.
They have more been prac-
ticing since September.

Stavrides, a senior with a
Black Belt in karate, has
trained with Sen-Sei Ansei
Ueshiro (the head of this style
of karate) for six vears and Sen-
Sei Joseph Johnston for four
vears. Ueshiro is a seventh
degree Black Belt and Johnston
is a third degree Black Belt

Of this style of karate,
Stavrides said. “It's a very,
very family-like thing and all
have allegiance to Sen-Sai An-
sei Ueshiro.”

There are about seventy
Black Belts presently in the
United States.

The class at Johnston Gym is
divided into three parts. The fir-
st is dedicated to attaining en-
durance and stamina. The
students are required to do 100
sit-ups and 100 push-ups to at-
tain this endurance.

The second part of the class is
devoted to Kata, or the very
pure form of karate.

The third part is dedicated to
Kumite ctighting: and selt-
defense training.

Stavrides stated that. “When

students first) begin to) study
karate, them intentions and
aspirations are simply to
become the best 9 tighter

around

“However, when the student
has had one-half vear of ex-
perience in traming, he realizes
that karate is more than just
learning how to fight. Karate
then becomes a means for a
student to gain sell-confidence
and an inner sincerity.

Stavrides is quick to point out
the many differences in karate
and judo. He also added that,
“Students who wish to join now
are eligible to qualify for
promotion to the rank of green
belt.”

Sometimes a student
becomes discourage and won-
ders if it is really worth it. When
this happens, Stavrides tells the
student what his own “sen sei"
(teacher) told him when he first
began.

He told us that nothing in life
that is worthwhile comes
easily,’ Stavrides recalled. -
“Everything good in life is
gained through hard work,
sacrifice, and perhaps some
blood.’
