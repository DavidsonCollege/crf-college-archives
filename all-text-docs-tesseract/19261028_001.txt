In all probability the N. C. State-Davidson
football game will be played at Greensboro
in 1927, according to a recent. announcement
by athletic authorities of both institutions.
This was not made as a definite statement;
but it is well understood that negotiations
are under way for the contest to be played
in the new Municipal Stadium of the “Gate
City.” Up until the last two years the two
teams have met at the annual State Fair at
