A socialist, a Nazi, a vege-
tarian: all of these answered a
voter registration poll circulated
among the student body last
week by THE DAVIDSONIAN.

As far as parents are con-
cerned, Davidson students fe-
flect the national trend of regis-
tering along similar party lines

within the family.

In overall figures, however,
students showed a preference
for the label ‘Independent rath-
er than the Deimocratic or Re-
publican parties of their par-
ents.

What the poll of’ Davidson
students indicated fo us was
that many students were more
interested in voting by judging
the candidates on the basis of
their individual merits, rather
than by affiliating themselves

Of the 250 students who an-

County Registration Poor

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor
Although the voter registra-
tion for Davidson students is
not numerically impressive, it
far surpasses any percentages
that Mecklenburg County can
boast for its 18-2l-year-old pop-

ulation.

Out of 18,500 legal residents
under 21, the county has regis-
tered since January 1 a total
of 2,542 or about 14% of the
group.

Of these regist-rved, the Dem-
ocratic party is well in the lead
with 1543 or 61% of the group.
The Republicans are next with
623 or 25% of the total, and the
Independents follow with 375 or
about 15% of the group. There
is also one voter registered
with the American Party.

In North Carol.na there are
actually five different ways in
which to register: Democrat,
Republican. Independent, Amer-
ican, or ‘No Party.”

This last designation is legiti-
mate, and serves one extra
function which the indepedent
category deos not apply to. In
case of a primary, Democratic
or Republican, a member of
the ‘‘No Party” group has the
option of declaring for one par-
ty or the other on the day of
the primary with very little red
tape. A registered Independent,
however, does not have this op-
tion and cannot participate in
any primary.

The American Party, headed
by Alabama Governor George
Wallace, was established in this
State by a petition of 10,000
signatures, It will remain on
the books until the party fails
to poll 10% of the vote in a
gubernatorial or presidential
election, which it did back in
1968 in the national election.

Elections Board official Bil!
Culp described the 18-21 voter
registration as ‘‘moderate” so
far this year. He said that it
is natural that most people re-
gister with the Democratic par-
ty since it does control the state
and since its primaries often
decide who will be the next
elected official.

He commented on the regis-
tration of young voters thus far
by saying that more than 2,000
of the 2,542 registered have
s.gned up only since mid-July.
This was because the state did
not allow 18-21 year olds to par-
ticipate in local elections until
this July. Only about 500 people
had registered in the half year
s.nce the 26th Amendment went
into effect January 1.

Culp urged, ‘‘Students inter-
ested in making changes should
get involved directly on the
grass roots level. Yelling will
not change anything.”

In the entire county, out of
200,000 eligible voters, 131,951
are registered. The breakdown
is as follows: Democrats, 92,-
783: Republicans, 34,915; Inde-

Drive Mounted Statewide

By ALEC HOON
Asst. Managing Editor

Greg Scott! Assistant to the
President, is presently engaged
in contacting people to serve on
a steering Committee to or-
ganize voter registration drives
in Mecklenburg County.

Committee members present-
ly include students from J. C.
Smith University, Piedmont
College, and UNC-Charlotte.

The first meeting is scheduled
for sometime next week.

Similar groups are being
formed all over the state. Chap-
el Hill students are presently
engaged in “Operation Inter-
face,” a drive to register peo-
ple in the 18-24 year old age
group.

There was also a group at
Appalachian State University to
register in-state students when
they enrolled for classes.

Many of these committees
stem from a conference in mid-
August, called the Student Ac-
tion Conference ‘71-72, which

sought to initiate voter regis-
tration.

Davidson SGA President Dan-
ny Clodfelter and Scott attend-
ed this meeting.

Davidson students Bo Phil-
lips and Don Parman are con-
tinuing their fight to have an
Elections Board decision which
forbids students to register in
the district where they attend
college overturned.

Phillips said that he hoped to
circumvent the state courts be-
cause he feared an adverse rul-
ing, and take the case to fed-
eral court.

The two students are being
financially backed by ‘‘Com-

mon Cause,” a group similar .

to the American Civil Liberties
Union.

Their lawyer is George Daly,
an ACLU lawyer.

Phillips remarked, “‘At least

fifteen states, including: Califor-. -
nia and Massachusetts; have .
ruled that students can tegis-.

ter and vote where they go to
school.”

Javidson Voters’ Pick Party Of Parents

whereas in Pennsylvania, regis-
tration was required under one
of the two major parties.

The _ statistics themselves
would not seem to lend them-
selves to broad generalizations
phout the way the average

avidson student will cast his
ballot.

Some points can be made
however.

In the Davidson poll, 62% of
the group were either register-
ed in the same party as their
parents or unaffiliated with any
party as their parents were.

Conversely, 38% of the stu-
dents were registered in par-
ties other than those of their
parents or unaffiliated when
their parents were- members of
a specific party.

As the poll relates to parents,

ed as Independents provide the

Che Davtdsonian

Report

week, the company broadcast
an editorial opposing the en-
franchisement of students in
areas where they are only tem-
porary residents, such as a col-
lege campus.

The editorial warned against
the danger of a ‘transient stu-
dent body” which could over-
rule a local population on bond
issues that only the local peo-
ple would ‘have to finance.

The editorial granted the
right of students to vote in
their home towns or in cases
where they had established lo-
cal residence and paid property
taxes.

Yet the editorial concluded:
**But just because a lot of stu-
dents don’t like the local mayor

or think there should be acres_

upon acres of additional parks
doesn’t give them the slightest
right to vote the parks out or
vote the parks in.

“They themselves won't be
around much longer to feel the
effects of either. But the per-
manent residents will, which
makes it obvious that the run-
ning of, the town should be left
to the people who stay there,
work there, and pay their taxes
to keep things going.”

Dr. John Robbins, Professor
of History at UNC Charlotte
responded the following night
to the editorial, refuting . the
argument of ‘‘transience” as
applicable to plenty of voters
out of college.

He pointed out that the 1970
census counts students as resi-
dents of their university com-
munities.

Robbins concluded: “It is im-
portant that the young voter
take an active interest in the
affairs of his community as he
defines it.

“Maybe if we allow young
pepoie meaningful participation
in local government, they will
see the importance of seeking—
and indeed will seek—solutions
to problems on a local level
rather than constantly looking
to the federal government.
That’s a result I'm sure WBT
would applaud.”

Of those students registered
as Independents, 56% of their
parents are either registered as
Republicans or as Democrats.

Absentee
A Voting

AN ANALYSIS
‘By ALEC HOON

Asst. Managing Editor

The absentee ballot is a deter-
rent to those students who wish
to exercise their voting rights.

Students should be permitted
to vote in the election district
where they attend college.

The reasoning behind this
logic is that the amount of pa-
per work one has to fill out to
get an absentee ballot could
effectively discourage many
students from voting; who other-
wise might have done so if it
only required going to a polling
station to vote.

Take for example the proce-
dure ito get an absentee ballot
in Pennsylvania. (It must be
done before every election to
get a ballot for the election.)

Before the election, one must
go to the board of elections and
complete a form requesting
that an absentee ballot form be
sent to one’s college address.

Presumably, if one is at col-
lege at the time preceeding the
election, someone else must
pick up the form and mail it
to him ito fill out. They cannot
complete it for him.

Upon receipt of this form, the
board will send him another
longer form to answer. After
completing this and mailing it

‘back, one receives an absentee

ballot.

It is amazing how few peo-
ple will bother to go to the polls
to vote. It would be hard to
imagine how many students are
going to take the time to file
for an absentee ballot in Penn-
sylvania.

are Republicans, and 16% are
Democrats, leaving 10% of the
parents in which couples con-
sist of a Republican and a
Democrat.

The balance shows that 44%
of those Independent students
have parents who are also In-
dependents, which is less than
a simple majority of the Inde-
pendent group.

From the above we see that
a large minority of students,
primarily sons of Repvhlican
parents, have broken family
party lines to register as Inde-
pendents in order to cast their
votes for the individual rather
than the partisan group.

Approximately two per cent
of the registered students have
switch from the partisan group
of their parents to another par-
tisan group. That is, three of
the students who answered the
poll are registered Republicans
where their parents are Demo-
crats and two students with Re.
publican parents are registered
Democrats.

This small percentage of par-
ty switching gives only a light
indication of a tendency of chil-
dren of Southern Democratic
parents to register with the
other party because the Repub-
tican party offers a more con-
servative platform in national
politics. This ideological shift

Ballots:

Deterrent

On top of this, in some states
in certain elections one cannot
vote by absentee ballot. In
North Carolina, for example,
one cannot vote in the primaries
by absentee ballot.

Nevertheless, at the present
time, in all of about fifteen
States, out-of-state college stu-
dents attending college in that
state will be forced to vote by
absentee ballot.

The only hope for these stu-
dents, is that through court
cases in which individuals ap-
peal the ruling on student resi-
dency requirements, the pre-
sent rulings will be overturned.

However, those opposed to
this would cite the argument
that such a change would per-
mit students at large colleges
and universities to control
many of the surrounding local
elections.

This simply would not be the
case. As College President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr. remarked,
“We are a small community in
which students might outnum-
ber the local voters.” But fears
that students would ‘‘take over
the town’s direction” are un-
founded.

“Students are individuals
enough to split on issues in the
town just as tthey do on other
issues,” he said.

Two Davidson students are
presently appealing the ruling
made in North Carolina by Alex
K. Brock, the Executive Secre-
tary of the State Board of Elec-
tions, that students are ‘eligible
to register and vote in the coun-
ty or state of his legal residence
only.”
