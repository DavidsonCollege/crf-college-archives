ers handle a broom gingerly, we cannot
help but saw “hats off” to the profs. No
man now confined to the campus will
soon forget the work of our sincere
friends, the residents of Davidson, and
the spirit which prompts them. ™M. E.

Every American soldier who has
fallen in France, every American sailor
who has died for his country’s cause has
given his life for his people. Surely we,
their people, can lend our money to our
Nation, their country.

The Fourth Liberty Loan is the fight-
ing loan. Its great success will bring
comfort and encouragemént and a deep
sense of pride to our Army and our
Navy, and to our Allies; it will bring
discouragement to our enemies. Its suc-
cess means American victory, Prussian
defeat.

The fourth loan is the fighting loan,
the soldiers’ loan.

THINK IT OVER.

With the inauguration of the Student
Army Training Corps at Davidson,
many changes have taken place.
were glad to see some of the changes and
had been hoping that they be brought
about. However, there is one change
which we regret to see. This is that
the blessing or grace is no longer said
before meals.

father of William Farnum.

not prescribed, so far as is known, but it
is often done at army mess shacks. Shall
we Davidson students neglect this mat-
ter while soldiers in the regular army do
not. Let us hope that it will not be
necessary to mention this matter again,
for we are sure that everyone will be
willing to comply with this suggestion.

Ever since we turned over our money
to Mr. Jackson and our time to Uncle
Sam, The Davidsonian has been “up
against it.” With only four staff men
back on the job and a depleted reporters’
staff, the first issue was attempted. How-
ever, with the aid of post-graduates and
several new men, the first issue came
from the press on time. Before we could
recover our breath, the “flu” (Spanish
variety) struck the campus in force.
When the roll was éalled we found our
editor-in-chief, business and circulation
managers and six staff men occupying
cots in the South Wing. The obstacles
overcome in presenting this issue to the
public, should, therefore, commend it to
its readers, M. BE.

Lieut. Ervin D. Shaw, ex-’15, was an
aviator of no mean ability. He had re-
ceived his training in the air service at
camps in Ohio and later had worked at
Oxford and in parts of Scotland. When
flying with the British airmen over the
front line he had already brought down
twa enemy planes and gave promise of
doing more good work in the future.

Lieutenant Shaw was the eldest son
of Mr. D. C. Shaw, of Sumter, S. C.
He was a member of the football squad
at Davidson and was noted for his driv-
ing in a little Ford. He was popularly
known as “Molly” during his college
career.

Lieutenant Shaw went out on July 9
with an observer on a single machine
reconnaissance. He was downed by
three enemy scouts after a long, hard
struggle. His major wrote that he was
one of the bravest and coolest in the
squadron and that he was always cheery
and stout-hearted, no matter what work
, was wanted,

It was with much regret that we
learned of Lieutenant Shaw's death, and

Davidson College has reason to be
thankful for the friendly ties that exist
between the students and the townspeo-
ple. Under ordinary circumstances some
of us fail to realize how close to the
heart of the town the college really is,
but who has not been stirred by the
splendid response of the community to
the present needs of the college? The
ladies of the town are giving the sick
boys care that only a mother can equal.
The Red Cross has donated sheets, pa-
jamas, handkerchiefs, face masks and
other necessities. There is being oper-
ated a kitchen and dietary from which
-are issued such delicious dishes, that
convalescents are loathe to get well.
How can one help but be proud of the
work the faculty is now doing? Every
professor is doing all in his power to
help in this situation. Even though some
make rather awkward waiters and oth-
