‘Informal Rush Nets

Over 100 Freshmen

% Bq RICH WILSON

Asst. Managing Editor

Approximately 40 per cent
of the freshman class pledg-
ed one of four fraternities
as a result of the rush held
last week, according to
Lyman Parrigit}— rush
spokesman for the frater-
nities. oy

“The figures speak for
themselves,’ said Parrigin.
“Out of a class of 290 fresh-
men, 112 pledged a frater-
nity. As far as.I am con-
cerned this leaves any
editorial criticism invalid.
When one considers” that
only one third of the frater-
nities were participating, I
think. we could consider this
rush successful."

Parrigin also noted that

Faculty Adopts One Week
Extension Of Drop Period

The faculty has adopted a
proposal extending the
‘‘drop-add’’ period. Effective
with this winter term, stud-

McKelway Joins
Theologians In
Honor of Barth

‘Alexander J. McKelway,
associate professor of Bible
and religion and author of
the award: winning book
“The Systematic Theology
of Paul Tillich,"’ recently
joined several of the most
noted theologians in Ameri-
ca for a colloquium honor-

ing the late Karl Barth in

New York City..

Barth, a German theolo-

gian whose voluminous work‘:

“Church Dogmatics’’ is con-
sidered one of the great-
est theological masterpieces
ever written, died in Decem-
ber of 1968, The~colloquium
at Union Theological Sem-
inary commemorated his
contribution to theology and
the world..« .

(McKelway was to speak at
8 p.m. Friday night on ‘How
Karl Barth Changed My
(Mind"’ along with Dr. John
C. Bennett, president emeri-
tus of the seminary.

Other . noted theologians
participating included ‘Mar-
cus Barth, John Deshner,
Hans Frei, Frederick Her-

zog, Paui ‘Lehmann, J.
‘Brooke ‘Mosley; J-ames
Smart, Gabriel _Vahanian,

James Wharton, and others,

a course within two weeks
(ten academic days).

This is an extension of
five academic days to the
old ‘‘drop” arrangement.

It will be required that a
student add a new course
within five academic days.
Those who drop a course
after five academic days
will be unable’to add a new
course to their schedule. For
the remainder of the term
they will be without a third

_ course, and this course will

be paid for although they do
not take it.

According to J. H. Ost-
walt, registrar, very few will
probably take advantage of
the new procedure. Only in a
few crucial cases have major
problems developed because
of the old ‘‘drop-add’’ me-

thod.

However, Ostwalt feels
that. it will be beneficial
overall despite a few minor
problems. The counting
process will be slowed down,
class rolls will be made
available at a later date,
and the revised schedule will
not be compiled as soon as

previously.
The Edugational Policy
Committee originally pro-

posed a five week ‘‘drop”’
period, but this was not ac-
cepted by the faculty.
Ostwalt: was unable to give
a definite reason why a five
week ‘“drop™ period was
unacceptable to the faculty,
but he did theorize that the
faculty felt that a two weck
period was long enough.

_ In this two week period it
is felt that a proper assess-
ment can—be—made of a
course,..and_ additional time
will serve no beneficial pur-

pose. Ostwalt stressed the
point that a studerit. will
be unable to pick up a new
course after the first week,
and that caution should be
exercised in this area.

tors joined fraternities
including the Freshman Class
President and Vice Presid-
ent, who were both members
of the Committee of Eigh-
teen. ;

“The figures are very en-
couraging for the four
fraternities,’ said Parrigin.
“It seems that the strength
of the selective fraternity
group may have been under-
estimated.

“What fraternities
asking for is a reasonable
chance to operate as they
choose and then stand dr fall
on their own merits h in
philosophical and economi-
cal terms,” he said.

“These four fraternities
will_continue—to—-press_—for
modifications of the college
program or if necessary
possibly move off campus
and withdraw from the plan
entirely,’ said Parrigin’

Dean of Students Richard
C. Burts Jr, said, ‘As it
stands now, this rush will
have no effect on the ran-
dom assignment of freshmen
over Christmas. Freshmen
will be randomly” assigned
to houses whether they have
accepted a bid from a par
ticular house or not."

Burts refained from com-

are

menting, however, on the
implications of the rush.

When asked whether the
recent rush was successful
or unsuccessful, Assistant to
the President Peter H. Hob-
bie said, ‘I think it was
irrelevant; I don't believe it
will have any effect, I per-
sonally feel this will be one
of the last rushes we'll see
on this campus,"’ -he said.

Hobbie also said that the
figures from this rush would
very likely have no effect on
the trustees. ''The new plan
hasn't . even © started, yet
some fraternities are looking
for reasons why it will not
work. It staggers my imag-
ination that the trustees will
make—a-change.”’

‘Hobbie also said that the
fraternity situation has been
debated by the trustees and
a decision, has been made.
I don't believe there will
be any basis on which to
judge the new system by the
spring meeting of . the
trustees,’ he said.

Freshman Class President
Bill Ralston said he felt the
rush was successful. ‘I was
surprised at the number of
boys that went ahead and
pledged,”’ he said.

Most Fraternities Adopt —
College’s Affiliation Plan

AN ANALYSIS
By GRAY WILSON

Asst. Managing Editor

With the December 15
deadline this week, all of
the twelve fraternities on
Patterson ‘Court have re
sponded to the recommen-
dations of the Committee of
Eighteen.

Only two houses were still
undecided. last week, ‘but
(Monday Pi Kappa Alpha
egies unanimously to accept

e college plan, keep their
charter; “ahd remain in their
housé.

This decision came after
a meeting last week with a
representative from the na-
tional fraternity, who agreed
to let the house keep its
charter under the college
plan.

The only other house un-
decided at the end of last
week was Sigma;Phi Epsilon
which has taken three votes
this week in an effort to de-
termine the future status of
the fraternity.

On (Monday, Sigma Phi
‘Epsilon voted to reject the
college’s random _ assign-
ment plan. However, a group
within. the house petitioned
for a second meeting ‘on
Tuesday.

_ overturned,

At the Tuesday meeting,
Sigma Phi Epsilon voted to
accept the college plan, re-
tain their charter,
main in their house at least
until the end of the year.
Further plans were delayed
for later consideration,

Sigma Phi Epsilon voted
Wednesday afternoon to nul-
lify Tuesday's vote and to
reinstate the decision of
Monday:

Sigma Phi Epsilon will re-
ject the college’s plan by re-
fusing to accept random as-
signees.

The reason the vote was
according to
fraternity. president Dave
Shepler, was that a national
representative notified the
fraternity that they would
lose their charter ‘‘as soon
as a random assignee set

; foot in the house.’’

It was also notéd that the
fraternity would lose their
furniture soon thereafter.

(Phi Gamma Delta, which
had originally accepted the
college's plan, reversed. its
decision also after a_ visit
by a national representative.

At present Phi Gamma

Delta intends to. move , off

campus.. The national re-

and re-

presentative reportedly told
the fraternity and the col-~

_M€ge_ dean of students that

legal precedents: wduld_ in
sure the success of such a
move.

Kappa Alpha is the other
fraternity so far which has
decided to give up their
house, keep their charter,
and move off campus. A
verbal agreement has been
made to lease a house off
campus beginning next fall.

Phi Delta Theta was the
only fraternity to complete-
ly reject the college plan.
They have decided to keep
their house and charter un-.,
til the end of ‘the school
year, during which time they
will consider a plan for the
future.

Sigma Chi rejected the col-
lege plan, but they plan to
cease all. operations“at the
end of the year, which in
effect is statement IV of the
proposal.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon has

found itself in a particular

dilemma because it is under
the college plan on campus
and bas successfully parti-
ttipated in rush’ The house is
determined to keep its
pledges.
