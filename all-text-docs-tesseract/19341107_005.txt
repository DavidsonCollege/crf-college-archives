WILDCATS, DEVILS WIN

Davidson Overpowers Catawba;
Duke Rally Defeats Auburn

Big Five teams won three out of five
last week. Carolina, Duke and David-
son drew wins from Georgia Tech, Au-
burn, and Catawba respectively, while
State and Wake Forest were losing to
Clemson, and Emory and Henry.

Carolina took their cue from Sher-
man and completed their march through
Georgia with a smashing defeat over Ga.
Tech, 26-0. Two weeks ago in Georgia
territory, they upset the University of
Georgia Bulldogs, 14-0. Montgomery,
understudy/for the great Charlie Shaffer,
ploughed through the Tech line twice
in the opening period for touchdowns.
Don Jackson and Jim Hutchins ac-
counted for the other two Carolina
scores. Tech was outclassed in every
respect and their only threat was stopped
in the second quarter.

The Duke Blue Devils recovered from
the Tennessee downfall enough to trim
the Auburn eleven 13-6 at Birmingham.
The only pass of the game—Parker to
Cornelius—put the game on ice late in
the fourth period after Scarborough had
scored in the second. The Plainsmen
scored in the second quarter after a
gallant “back to the wall” stand in the
first. The field was slippery and each
touchdown made was indirectly the re-
sult of a fumble. Ed ‘West, right-end,
and Parker, Duke’s versatile back, were
the Devil stars of the day.

Davidson, after sending a _ valiant
Catawba team home with an 18-0 licking,
lies in wait for Carolina next Saturday.
What will happen this Homecoming Day
we leave for Felix to predict, but for
the first time since the State game,
Davidson will present a squad unbroken
by injuries.

State and Wake Forest were the less
fortunate of the Big Five teams. State
dropped its homecoming game to Clem-
son 12-6 and Emory and Henry defeated
Wake Forest 13-0.

Indians Downed

By Wildcats

(Continued from Page 4)

The Wildcats ‘made their first score
late in the second period when Mackorell
ran back a punt from the midway stripe
to the Catawba 29. Hutchins and Ver-
ble picked up a yard each through the
line. A pass, Mackorell to Morgan,
placed the ball on the 15 yard stripe.
Mackorell gained 6 at end and 3 at tackle
to place the ball in “scoring position.
Hutchins then crashed through tackle to
cross the stripe for a touchdown, the first
time that the Indian goal had been cross-
ed this season.

The first half ended with the Wildcats
hammering the ball deep into Indian ter-
ritory on another threat to score.

In the third period, Wingfield caught
a punt on his own 30 yard line and side-

DEFEATED 10-44

High Point, State High School
Champions, Defeat Freshman
Cross Country Team

The High Point High School cross
country team defeated the Davidson
Freshman cross country team, 19-44, last
Saturday morning over the Davidson
two-mile course.

Although the score was rather heavy
against Davidson this defeat was not dis-
graceful as High Point had the state
high school championship cross country
team last year. During the course of
last year's season High Point beat the
freshman team of every Big Five school
and some observers proclaim this year’s
team better than that of last year.

Davis, of High Point, led the way
covering the course in 10 minutes 26.5
seconds but he was closely followed by
Parcell of Davidson. The next four
men were of High Point, finishing in
the following order: Ellington, Chaslin,
Balton, and Hadrick. Other men fin-
ishing for Davidson were Gilks, Dowdle,
Rainey, Bryant, Isler and Gilbert.

Parcell’s work was particularly out-
standing as this was his first attempt at
cross country running and he covered
the course in 10 minutes, 32.5 seconds.
This is the best time a freshman has
run the course in since Earl Frazier set
his mark in 1932,

As this was their first meet, higher
hopes are held for the future freshman
cross country engagements.

stepping a host of Catawba players,
raced 51 yards to the Indian’s 19 where
Dinges brought him down from behind.
This threat ended on the next play when
Guy recovered a fumble by Yarborough.

A repetition of the Mackorell to Mor-
gan pass combination in the fourth period
drove the ball deep into Catawba terri-
tory. A series of drives by Hutchins,
Wingfield, and Mackorell put the ball on
the visitors’ 12 for a first down. Verble
picked up a yard at center, followed on
the next play by Mackorell who went
around left end on a weak sideplay for
the second touchdown of the game.

The last touchdown was made late in
the game when Morgan recovered a
fumble on the Indians’ 20 yard line. A
line run by Verble and a Mackorell to
Morgan pass put the ball on the 6 yard
marker. Wingfield and Verble each
gained through the line, On the next
play, Mackorell went around left end
and over the goal line standing up to ring
up the final score of 18-0,

MACKORELL, MORGAN
GIVE THEIR OPINIONS

(JIM MORGAN)

“Big Jim’ Morgan, stellar end on the
Wildcat eleven, will make his last ap-
pearance before a Homecoming crowd
next Saturday against the University of
North Carolina. Morgan hails from Al-
bemarle and has made an outstanding
reputation in his three years of var-
sity football at Davidson.

Last year Morgan received a berth
on the second team of the mythical All-
State eleven and is a strong contender
for first place honors this season. He
plays a*smart, roving type game and
his ability to follow the ball and wreck
opposing plays has made him feared by
all Davidson opponents. “Big Jim’ is
especially adept at pass-receiving and oc-
cupies the receiving end of the famous
“Mackorell-to-Morgan” pass combina-
His speed and height make him
extremely difficult to bottle up.

In addition to his ability on the grid-
iron, Morgan holds letters in two other
major sports. Ie holds down the cen-
ter position on the basketball team and
is a hard-hitting outfielder on the base-
ball nine,

Morgan
several

Was interviewed regarding
phases of the football season
and, because of his experience and repu-
tation, his views should carry a great
deal of weight. In regard to the Home-
coming game with Carolina next Satur-
day, Jim feels that the team is showing
good spirit and he reminded your re-
porter that “a Davidson team is never
beaten until they leave the field.” The
whole squad is training faithfully and
hope to furnish quite a pleasant sur-
prise for the Davidson Alumni and sup-
porters,

Jim praised the work of Guy, right
tackle on Catawba’s team, and believes
that. his ability to diagnose plays\makes
him the most formidable lineman that
he has played against this year. Mor-
gan says that he has “learned a lot of
football at Davidson” and thinks that
the Wildcats have a fine coaching staff.

Bogart Returns From
Physics Frat Meeting

Bill Bogart, a member of the Senior
Class, recently attended the National
Convention of Sigma Pi Sigma (hon-
orary Physics Fraternity) which was
held at West Lafayette, Ind., at Purdue
University, where he represented the
Davidson chapter of Sigma Pi Sigma.
This was the third annual convention
and the first one to which Davidson sent
a representative,

The Davidson chapter is the Alpha
chapter of the fraternity, it having been
founded here in 1921. It was founded
by Dr. J. M. Douglas and several others
who were interested in Physics.

The convention lasted from Oct.-11
to Oct. 13. During this time there were
several lectures given to the delegates
on problems of especial interest to those
interested in Physics. Many problems
concerning the business of the national

(JOHNNY MACKORELL) .

Johnny Mackorell, captain and triple-
threat back of the Wildcat squad, will
lead a hard fighting Davidson team on
Richardson Field Saturday. In addition
to his excellence in running, passing,
and punting, Mackorell has proven his
ability as a field general and can always
be counted on to play a brilliant, steady
game.

Mackorell received a_ well-deserved
place in the All-State backfield last year
and has been a consistent contender for
All-American honors. New York sports
writers said that he was among the
greatest backs that had come under
their observation and the Army game
officials said that he was as good as
any back they ever saw. Walter Skid-
more, Carolina scout in the press box
at the Davidson-Catawba game said that
he could be All-American easily on a big
college team. The Harvard scouts even
went further in their praise and called
Mackorell- the greatest back they had
ever seen,

In regard to the Homecoming game
with Carolina, Mackorell thinks “they
will be the best team we have met this
season with the exception of Army.
However, if we play like we are cap-
able of playing, we should give them
a good fight. Our present team, as a
whole, is better than the one of last year,
and with the exception of the Citadel
game we have played much harder foot-
ball.”

“The Army,” in Johnny’s opinion, “is.
the hardest blocking and tackling team
that we've met yet, but I don’t think
they excell Davidson by as much as the
41-0 score indicates. Simons, of Army,
impressed me as being the outstanding
back that we have been-up against.

“Looking at it from ‘my own point of
view,” Johnny said, “I will consider this
a successful season if we beat Caro-
lina. This has been my ambition ever
since I have been at Davidson. I be-
lieve that we will wip at least two of
the remaining three games on our sched-
ule. I want to take this opportunity
to express my appreciation to the entire
squad for the spirit and cooperation they
have shown this year. I can truthfully
say that this is the hardest working squad
that I've been on in my four years at
Davidson, Regardless of the outcome of
the next three games, I am confident
that the squad will deserve the praise
and support of the student body for
their earnest efforts and I feel sure that
the students» will back them, win or lose,
in every way.”

fraternity were discussed and several
reports were given,

It was not decided:where the conven-
tion was to be held next year. The dele-
gates were to discuss the past conven-
tion with their respective chapters and
get the various chapters’ reactions to
the good of the convention, before set-
ting a meeting place for next year or
even deciding whether or not to have
a convention,
