Elections Are Here

This week saw the beginning of the annual spring elections,
the annnal spring Student Elections. In the next few weeks
will be decided who is going to lead the Davidson Student Body
during the coming year and who will head the ‘various organiza-
tions, publications and classes. This week saw the beginning of
the end for some of us as student leaders, but it also saw the
beginning of new careers, new leaders, and new ideas. In less
than a month the leadership of the students will be in new

hands, the hands that will guide them for a year. We must all
become familiar with those hands because we want the best pairs
at the helm.

"We owe it to ourselves to participate 100 per cent in all the
elections we are eligible to vote in, The privilege of choosing
whom we want to lead us is one of our most cherished freedoms.
To forget to cast your vote or to entirely lack interest in the
elections, your elections, is to show your lack of appreciation
for this privilege that we have of choosing our own leaders.

In the years before the war, students here took a great deal
of personal interest in Student Elections and as a result our
student government and our entire campus
strengthened. However, since the war, student interest has not
reached that prewar level for various reasons and that feeling
of Davidson spirit has not existed here on the campus as it
used to.

I sincerely hope that the elections this year will see a re-
newed interest on the part of the students in their elections and
that this interest will be manifested at the polls. SLECTIONS
ARE HERE SO CAST YOUR VOTE TODAY !—Whit Cobb.

Make Room For John Doe

By means of a poll of the entire Student Body we have
been able to establish three facts concerning Student Body
opinion regarding our athletic program.

‘ A substantial majority indicated that if we must choose
between high academic rating and athletic renown the good
academic standing is to be preferred. However, as may have
been expected, over 90 per cent of the Student Body chose both
a strong athletic program and a high academic standing as the
goal for which we should strive.

The importance of the first. point—that most of us were
wise enough to realize that our primary purpose in being here
is to learn to educate ourselves—should. not be overlooked. The
Student Body as a group indicated that they believed a certain
basic amount of subsidization is necessary if we are to continue
to compete with schools of. the State, W. & L., Citadel, Rich-
mond and Furman calibre.

While it is obvious that some subsidization must be made,
we would Jike to see the athletic program made more a function
of the average member of the Student Body. A program could
be devised which would give us a team capable of holding its
own against such schools as have been mentioned, and at the
same time include a larger number of students of average
ability. Such a program would make room for those who wanted
to play for no other reason than for the fun of playing.

If on the other hand the athletic program is not to be a
student program—with the accent on the students—if it is to
be formulated without taking into consideration the matter of
making it possible for the maximum number of students to
participate. but to be dominated by alumni funds and interests,
then why not allow those interested to assume financial responsi-
bility for the entire program. In that case the portion of col-
lege funds now earmarked for subsidization purposes could be
invested in building up our intramural athletic program by
means of which a larger number of students of average ability
could more equally participate.

An Open Letter. vee

We, as a Student Body, were shocked and saddened on our re-
turn from Spring Holidays to learn of the death of one of our closest
friends, Scott Verner. We address this letter to his family and to those
members of the Student Body who knew him best with the hope that we
can, to some degree, let them know how much we valued his friendship

We are proud of the fact that he was a member of this Student
Body. In many little ways—unknown to most of us—~he helped to create
here the kind of environment that is Davidson's most treasured at-
tribute—that intangible quality about this school that will be David-
son to us when another gym replaces the one we now call new. It is
by virtue of men such 2s he that our lives are enriched and by lives
such as his that we are able o see the Spirit of God in our affairs,’

To remember him is a privilege we are fortunate in being able to
share, for in so doing we may to some extent make his honesty and
friendliness ours.

American history, is designed to
prevent the outbreak of any future
war by creating sufficient force to

the policy of the United States and
the other democracies from 1931

continued aggressions of the Axis
nations but doing nothing to op-

CONCERT REVIEW

By HENRY E. HANSEN

On April 5, at 8:15 p. m., “Mr.
William Whitesides, tenor, and Mr.
Alfred Neumann, pianist, were
presented in concert by the David.
son College Department of Music.
To the fifty or more people as-
sembled in Chambers Auditorium
the program was a rewarding and
an enjoyable experince.

trace of rough Hansen

quality and this was shown in one
of his swell passages. They were
delivered in a restrained and sim.
ple manner with an impression of
great feeling which suited the char-
acter of Handel's music perfectly.

Mr. Neumann's first selection
was the Sonata, Opus 10, Number
1 by Beethoven. In the allegro
molto e con brio the tempi were
occasionally uneven but the dy-
namic contrasts and the cleanness
of delineation were excellent. The
adagio molto displayed exception-
ally good technique in the arpeg-
gios and runs and this movement
was played with a fine feeling for
the quality of the work. The last
movement, prestissimo, also occa.
sionally showed uneven tempi, but
here as throughout the sonata, the
playing was clean and the tech-
nique was wholly adequate to the
requirements of the work.

Mr. Whiteside’s second group

“| consisted of four songs by Johannes

Brahams. Mr, Whitesides is evi-
dently perfectly at home with Ger-
man lieder. From the first song
to the last, he displayed a quality
of diction; a feeling for and an
ability to convey interpretation; a
tone, powerful, yet constantly in
control;. and a oneness with the
emotions conveyed by the songe

liefs; and that they should avoid

Communists. To my mind, a world
dominated by a nation that has
‘publicly renounced Christianity,

gard for the rights of man, and
that has suppressed all freedom
such as we know it, is far worse
than the possibility of war, bad as
that is. I thoroughly agree with
Woodrow Wilson who once said
that “the right ... is more precious
than peace.”

Mr. Shriver's third point is that
the colleges should devote them-
selves to a more “positive” ap-

these songs most enjoyable to the
audience and the best sung of ‘any
of his selections. Mr. Whiteside’s
ebuilience is refreshing and_ this
quality helps to create rapport be.
tween himself and the audience.
Mr. Neuman’s second group
consisted of two pieces for piano
by Chopin: Berceuse, Opus 57 and
Polonaise in C-sharp minor, Opus
26, Number 1. Both were well
played with the technical and ex-
pressional competence which were
displayed so well in the Beethoven.
Mr, Neumann's feeling and expres-
sion could undoubtedly equal his
technique if he were not hampered
by the necessity of playing with the
music. This cannot but diminish
an over-all feeling for any work
of length. .

Mr. Whiteside’s last group con-
sisted of three songs by Purcel,
Monro, and Young. These are
numbers which, like the Handel,
gain nothing from the operatic
technique; they are simple, and
Mr. Whitesides rendered them in
a simple manner which heightened
their ingenious nature.

The concert was excellent. Mr.
Neumann, with the reservation
noted above is an excellent pianist
and a superb accompanist. At no
time in his accompaniment did he
detract from the feeling which Mr.
Whitesides -was trying to convey.
He was at all times complementary
to Mr, Whitesides and this is a
quality not easy to obtain. Mr.
Whitesides’ is a voice which is
instrinsically excellent. Endowed
as he is, he has, in the opinion of
this critic, only to polish and per-
fect his technique and improve his
stage presence to become a singer
of the very first rank. It is often
said that we do not appreciate our
own, but the size of the audience
testified to the fact that an increas-
ing number of people are becom.
ing aware of the exceptional talent
which does exist on this campus.
This trend is encouraged and it is
only to be hoped that these stu-
dent recitals will see an ever in-
creasing attendance.

I can’t, by any stretch of the
imagination, understand why the
colleges and universities should not
be concerned with preparedness as
the U..S. Government is, unless
these institutions are devoted to
pacifism. The job of the military,
as Mr. Shriver indicates, is ob-
viously to prepare the defenses of
this nation. And it is just as ob-
vious to me that, since the colleges
are a part of the Unied States and
will be protected by the military in
the event of war, they should be

If the colleges are devoted to
pacifism, however, then there is
logic to the argument that they
should not lend their support to the
objectives of the military estab.
lishment. As I understand the con-
cept of pacifism, war is considered
the greatest evil to befall mankind,
and resistance is never to be of-
fered under any circumstance, The
pacifist position, of course, is recog-
nized as a legitimate one in the
United States; and conscientious
objectors are not forced to take up
arms. I might point out here that
Pacifism was not recognized by
the Axis nations, nor is it recog-

proach to peace. I would agree
most heartily with him that the
institutions of higher learning
should devote themselves to the
problems of world peace in the
most positive sense. Certainly the
colleges should offer their students
the fullest opportunity to learn the
problems confronting the contem.
porary world, and should lend all
their resources to securing amity
among the nations of the world.

The one example Mr. Shriver
cites, however, as being the “posi-
tive” approach to peace—the Mc
Mahon plan—appears to me to be
basically sound.

The McMahon plan summed up
briefly calls for the U. S. to shift
the billions of dollars now being
spent on arms to projects that will
cultivate friendship with the Sovict
Union. The theory behind the idea,
of course, is this: the U. S. is
building up its armed forces there.
by threatening the Soviet Union.
If we discontinue this, we would
prove our good will to the Rus-
sians who are just waiting for such
a sign from us to become friendly.
In other ‘words, we are the po-
tential aggressors, and the Sovier
Union is the menaced nation.
The theory would be a good one
if it fit the facts; but it doesn’t.
Senator McMahon apparently
doesn’t remember that from the
years 1943 to 1947 this nation did
just what he is now proposing fo.
it to. do. We furnished them with
lend-lease aid. We assumed they
wanted to cooperate with the wes-
tern world, The Tehran, Yalta, and
San Francisco conferences attest to
that fact. The United States even
went out of its way. in the spring
of 1945 to persuade several Latin
American nations to establish rela-
tions with Soviet Union because it
appeared to us that there could
be genuine cooperation between
the east and the west. It was only

plan in essence has beem tried and

was not the power that failed to
cooperate. It was the Soviet
Union, which is also a matter of

Discrimination is obviously a
prime characteristic of the David-
son gentleman. The recent appear-
ance of the Robert Shaw chorale
was well attended (a big name
helps), while at the annual concert
of the Davidson male chorus there
were 43 students on the stage, and
3S in the audience. This shows
the delicate musical perception
among us, a quality evidently lack-
ing in the outside world. For in its
recent tour the chorus played to
packed houses and elicited such
naively enthusiastic reviews as “the
best we've heard,” “superlative,”
“finished artists of a near-profes-
sional calibre.” But at sophisticated
Davidson only one student in
twenty was interested enough to
turn out for the same program
‘Is this proof of our discrimination
or just another illustration of the
old adage, “A prophet is nowhere
without honor . . .” Or could it
be evidence of our cultural illit-
eracy?

It seems a little ironic if the
latter is the case, since Davidson
is a liberal arts college. and since
music is far and away our most
emphasized art. The general apathy
toward such things as dramatics,
speech, painting, and the various
forms of writing might be in some
measure excused; to date we've had
small opportunity to become ac-
quainted with them. But music is
another story. Our concert series,
our chorus, our band, our little
symphony orchestra—all are ex
cellent and have been excellent
over a period of years. And a very

regarded as one of the most valu-
able and indispensable advantages
of the democratic system. We hold
it in awe, and wonder what we
would do without it. We cannot
conceive of a government in these
United States that would not be
duly elected by the people whom
it would govern. We say that the
right to vote allows us to put men
whom we trust and respect in po-
sitions of authority, and thereby
indirectly we spend the taxes that
we pay into the public coffers and
we make the laws by which we
govern ourselves, And so we re-
gard this inherent right of ours as
sacred, and we will always fight
to keep it from being taken from
us.

But unless we wake up, we are
in danger of losing the free ballot,
not by having it denied us, but by
letting it wither and die from lack
of application. The specter of this
danger is very real. For the life
and virility of the suffrage varies
directly with its use, and we use
it all too little.

segment of the student body has
become aware of this program.
Maybe most of us are simply un-
educatable. If so, it is absurd to
speak, even in the future tense, of
having “a liberal arts college.”

Also a bit ridiculous, viewed in
this light, is our condescension to-
ward state institutions as “trade

The Will of the
Minority

By GABRIEL LOWE

But that purpose
can only be realized if all or nearly

; all who have the suffrage exercise

it. Otherwise, a minority, some-
times a very small one, will fill the
office for the whole electorate. For
example, in a local election in Jack-
sonville, Florida, several years ago,
only twenty-one per cent of those
eligible voted. This meant that the
issue at stake was decided by
eleven per cent of the voters, in-
stead of fifty-one per cent. It
amounted almost to a mandate is-
sued by one-ninth of the’ peopie
to the other eighth-ninths. In Vir-
ginia the notorius Byrd machine
is able to maintain its control over
the politics of the State by con.
trolling some 6-7 per cent of the
vote, since only about eleven per-
cent of Virginians -vote in local
contests.

The franchise cannot last long
in a society that pays no attention
to it. For it is a living creature,
and it thrives on use. Deny it that
use and it will starve to death.

The lesson has a local applica-
tion in the student body elections
now beginning. Last spring, in an
