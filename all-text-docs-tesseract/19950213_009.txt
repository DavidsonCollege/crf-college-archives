THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1995 9

Picture the typical Davidson
Wildcats’ men’s basketball game.
There you are sitting down to a
nice enjoyable evening of enter-
tainment when something a few
rows below catches your eye. At
first glance, it appears to be a huge
red undulating blob, writhing up

and down making hideous noises..

Startled, you take a closer look and
as things come into focus, you re-
alize it’s the Crazy Cat Fan Club.

You all know the scene. The
last couple times I’ve found my-
self in this situation, I been dis-
turbed by the behavior of this amor-
phous cheering monster. Rude is
one word that comes to mind.
Tasteless is another. But imma-
ture is probably the best word to

Valentine's Day
projects for the
romantically
impared

Being in the solitary state that
I am, I have more time on my
hands than most. Instead of spend-
ing my hours ina state of paralyz-
ing anguish about the impending
arrival of that day singles detest
most, a.k.a. Valentine’s Day, Ihave
compiled the following Top Ten
list of activities. Enjoy.

Ten things -to do on
Valentine’s Day to keep yourmind
off the fact that you’ re not getting
any loving:

1) Buy yourself a silk rose from
the Union Café,

2) Wonder about the homoerotic
undertones in last week’s karate/
concrete breaking half-time show.
3) Send love letters on Pollux.

4) Talk to St. Stephanie; she al-
ways makes you feel better.

5) Go to Kohé alone and tell them
its your birthday; not only will you
get to sit at’a table of people you
don’tknow (potential valentines?),
but you’ll get a great “happy day”
card,

6) Joke with David Valentiner
about his name (I’m sure the nov-
elty has yet to wear off).

8) Wear corduroy - it’ll make you
feel good.

9) Sit around with friends and play
some games I’ve found amusing
recently:

What name would you choose
if you could have only one name (a
la Cher or Madonna)?

During dart games at the Pub
bet your friends to smooch a par-
ticularly drunk barfly if you hit the
bullseye (match-making poten-
tial?).

Sit around Saturday afternoon
drinking Bloody Marys and watch
Dazed and Confused (not techni-
cally a game unless you count see-
ing whocan yell out the lines first).

Insult your friends in Old
English: “‘Fie, you wanton hussy!
A pox on thee,’ spake Kate. Ex-
eunt.”

10) Just to be spiteful of your own
lonely condition, leave messages
on people’s voice mail that they
have flowers at the Union.

11) Finally, be thankful you don't
have a significant other-what if
they wore underwear like the guy
on page 53 of the new J. Crew
catalog?

Settle down, Crazy Cats!

describe this beast. Now don’t get
me wrong; cheering is a wonderful
thing. Division I athletic programs
exist in large part because people
like to cheer for their favorite team.
And the Crazy Cats do a good job
of trying to raise fan support for
Davidson’s basketball team.
However, cheering for one’s
favorite team is distinctly different
from maliciously taunting an op-
posing team or the referees. From
my observations, I believe several
-members of the Crazy Cat Club to

be much more adept at the latter
than the former. As a fellow Spec-
tator, it revolts me to see a class-
mate wait till the crowd is silent
and then yell at the top of his lungs
(among other things), “Frankie,
you suck!” No, Frankie King does
not suck. Nor does Randolph
Childress. Nor do any of the other
highly trained athletes who have
graced Belk Arena. Each of them
represents hours and years of hard
work honing their skills to a level
where people will pay to watch

How aware are we?

Have Davidson students learned anything

since the freshmen geography quiz?

I thoroughly enjoyed Africa
Week and your recent coverage of
it. Mulling over the issue, how-
ever, certain thoughts came to mind
that have plagued me since I ar-
rived a semester ago as an interna-
tional student.

How much one actually be-
comes aware of the world and
events occuring in itis largely up to
the individual at Davidson Col-
lege, and rightly so. Information
cannot be forced on people. At the
same time,:I’ve been rather taken
aback by how unaware Davidson
students are of the globe spinning
underneath them, considering that
we do constitute one of the finest
colleges in the nation. An over-
used but appropriate example
would be our scores on the fresh-
men geography-current events test
taken during orrientation.

Ignorance, however, is not the

issue here. My point is, how many
of us regularly choose to familiar-
ize ourselves with the places and —
events surrounding us? If you took
the freshmen test with next year’s
class, how much better would you
fare? How many of us attended
one of the Africa Weeks events?
Toured the Chambers Gallery?
Could cite new facts we learned
from the Toilet Paper? Name the
city in which Japan’s recent earth-
quake, killing 5000, took place?

I find such questions worri-
some. Davidson College’s State-
ment of Purpose (1994-5) reads:
“The loyalty of the College ex-
tends . . . to the whole human
community.” Last year’s version
expressed similar sentiments, “the
College... would seek to’serve the
world.” How can we be loyal to
what we do not know, and serve
that which we do not understand?

comments at the edge of the page?

them play. A level of skill that can

earn them an education worth '

$20,000 a year (much larger a fig-
ure than the ten dollar Crazy Cat
membership fee). It sounds to me
like these guys should be praised
and applauded for their dedica-
tion, not ridiculed.

As if it’s not enough that the
opposing team has to hear every-
thing the Crazy Cats say (and be-
lieve me they do), the club goes so
far overboard that they consistently
elicit reciprocating taunts and

expletives from the victorious op-
ponents as they leave the court ©
after the game. Now as a final
insult, Davidson’s athletic depart-

ment must issue a spectator code

of conduct at the game because of
complaints to the Southern Con-
ference commissioner. Whata dis-
grace! Such despicable behavior
is a source of personal embarrass-
ment not only to me but to the
entire Davidson College commu-
nity.

Here’s some advice for you
Crazy Cats who insist on belittling
the other team. If not for the sake
of opponents, Davidson’s reputa-
tion, or my eardrums - for your
own sakes do yourselves a favor:

act your age and SHUT UP!

The force of Higher Learning

Today, violence pervades tele-
vision shows and video games.
This trend can be deadly because
there is a possibility of becoming
desensitized to violence. The lat-
est fad is trying to make money

-from our growing concern over

violence. This can be unnerving
and threatening because this sug-
gests an utter disregard for the ef-
fects of such atrend. Yet, violence

can be used effectively when nec-

essary.

In John Singleton’s latest
movie, Higher Learning, | believe
that violence is portrayed ina real-
istic manner, which allowed him
to deal with the issue of race in a
constructive way. Sometimes our
best, maybe only, weapon against
apathy and complacency is real-
ism.

The movie is set at a fictional
college, Columbus University, and

<< depicts the racial tensions at this

predominantly white university.

= Singleton touches on unforced seg-

regation, hate, sexuality, fear, ig-
norance, date-rape, and other is-
sues. These topics are given power
and life through realistic portray-
als. Because he deals with so many
topics, some might suggest that
this takes strength out of the movie.

Isee this as one of the movie’s
strengths. Having such a wide

range of topics, he is relieved of

~ Davidson student cracks under pressure and

the burden of trying to solve our
racial problems in atwo-hour film.
Singleton pursued those topics ina
way that the audience could see the
confusion and challenges of the
characters. We, the audience, are
so consumed with reality, we are
forced to think. We are forced to
think about our lives and our views.
We are forced to see our flaws and
those of others. We are forced to
see the need to solve.

The audience feels the anger
and realizes the difficult situation
of each character. Singleton does
not allow one to take sides on many
of the issues, because each charac-
ter has major flaws that cause ten-
sion. He shows the extent of their
thinking and the depth of their an-
guish. i

Near the end of the movie,
Singleton paints a clear image
about the future of such continued
hate and anger: a white guy and a
black guy, full of anger, run along
a stairwell towards one another;
when they finally meet, there is an
explosion of violence. You decide
the meaning of such a scene.

Higher Learning is important
because it is a realistic and ines-
capable picture. It forces us to
think about the need to end such
senseless violence and makes us
realize the possible effects of con-
tinued violence.
