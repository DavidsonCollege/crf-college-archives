Good Morning, Vietnam: something away from usual

By BRUCE PLOURDE
What is the first rule of economics?
Supply and demand. The populace creates
a demand, and it is met by a sufficient
supply. This rule applies to films as well.
Hence, Disney has abandoned Dumbo and
the Absent-Minded Professor in favor of
Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah. Hollywood
has succumbed tothe demands of its public,
too, by accepting that Vietnam is no longer
a taboo topic, but in fact a vastly popular
and highly profitable one. So it is that
somebody like me, who slept through one
{of the most dramatic periods in American
history, will run out to see any movie on Vi-
etnam on premiere night, regardless of its
faithfulness to truth or its romanticization.
‘So far the supply has been of limited vari-
ety. The innocence of youth dies in ‘Nam
as the frustrations of mediating a civil war
escalate. A monopoly has been established
which, though it meets a demand, offers no
alternative. °
For those with more exquisite tastes,
those whosnack on Brieand white wine, the
deficit has finally been resolved. A Viet-
nam movie has come to satisfy the urge for
something away from the usual. Good
Morning, Vietnam does not take place on a
battlefield, but in a military radio station in
Saigon. It follows the capricious life of
Adrian Colnauer, a radio announcer pulled
frem his assignment in Greece to entertain
the troops in Vietnam with his shocking,
swift wit. He violates every rule quoted to
him by his superiors to bring to the soldiers

grades, social rejection, death,
break-up of a relationship, or
missing home), the normal reac-
tion is depression.

It may look like everyone you
see is well adjusted and has a large
circle of friends, but this is often
not the case. Living with peers
and comparing oneself to others
can be stressing. It is possible to
lessen your isolation, but it will
take some emotional effort. Ask-—
ing someone to have coffee with

the humor and good music that help them
forget where they are. Yet it is not another
MASH, which ignores the war going on
outside the borders of prank-pulling army
hospital # 4077. It has all the force and
dementia of the blood and guts films, shown
from a different angle.

Yet another demand is met by drafting
Robin Williams in the lead role as Adrian
Colnauer. Not only is he cute as a button,
but he puts his own stray variety of comedy
to a practical use in this portrayal. A
demure and subtle serviceman under the
guise of his superiors, he transforms into a
joke consortium behind the microphone.
His witrushes forth at 78 RPM while all the
audience is set for 33. When the audience
stops laughing at one joke they realize that
they have already missed four others. His
speed in delivery is matched only by his
ability to assume other personalities. He
slips into the voice of his black, uptight
weatherman, his helicopter traffic reporter,
or Walter Cronkite as easily as a Yuppie
slips into his Porsche 944. Moreoutrageous
than Howard Stern, more daring than
Chuck Boozer, his popularity surpasses all
demand, limited only by the number of
soldiers the U.S. sends there. _

Hence the army’s dislike of him. The
Sergeant Major, who takes exorbitant
pleasure in reminding everybody that he

works for a living and is not to be called Sir,

tells Adrian from the first not to meddle
with him. The Lieutenant, who fancies
himself a semi-professional comedian, es-

to go for a bike ride may not be
easy at first. You may not find a
“best friend” right off, but you'll
probably begin to feel better.
Joining a club or taking up an
exercise can also sometimes help
to lift your mood. It’s not too late
to join and there are many organi-
zations, clubs, groups on campus
needing new members.

If you find your down mood is

tablishes for him the military definition of
humor. The military definition of humor?
Yup. “Y’know, slapstick, the Keystone
cops, that kind of thing.” They also rever-
ently suggest that he play such tunes as will
content the troops and keep them happy --
polkas, for instance.

Lastly, they assign him his own personal
pair of censors, who cut the readable news
items down to local clam bakes while
avoiding all mention of hostilities in Viet-
nam. These superiors (in rank only), serve
quite adequately to explain the General’s
Statement that military intelligence is a
contradiction in terms.

With so much forbidden on only the first
day on the job, what would any grown child
do? Adrian ignores all that he’s told and
sets up his enterprise of fun with a high-
energy vendetta, Every day he’s told.to
clean up his act, and every day he pushes the
army’s patience a little closer to the brink.
Fan mail and phone calls pour in from all
over Vietnam praising the ribald radio
announcer. The army find that they can’t
discipline him without instigating another
civil war. So the Sergeant Major and Liev-
tenant clench their teeth and wait, hoping
his liabilities will soon overshadow his
assets.

Robin Williams is not the only celebrity
asset to make his appearance in “Good

Morning, Vietnam.” Floyd Vivino also has —

a role, although insignificant, in this, his
first motion picture. What? Who is Floyd

Vivino? Obviously you haven’t spent:

If you know what’s causing
your depression,- you still may
find talking to someone helpful. It
can also help you to look at things
differently, to get some relief.
Often your situation may not be as
overwhelming as you perceive it.
Talking to an objective, trained
counselorcan help you notice this.
If you can pinpoint when the de-
pression or symptoms started and
possibly what’s causing it; then it
will be easier to start working on

nearly enough time in New Jersey if you
don’t know who Floyd Vivino is. In the
style of Pee Wee Herman, Floyd Vivino
spent upwards of ten years working on a
kiddie program called The Uncle Floyd
Show. It was carried on a local station that
probably didn’t carry outside the county,
yet it was humor defined.

He and his crew of amateur actors, while
entertaining the kiddies, filled their dia-
logues with so many high-yield innuendoes
and double-entendres that soon it attracted
the attention of a more mature audience,
too. In spite of its local popularity, The
Uncle Floyd Show faded into syndication,
rarely to be seen again except as fill pro-
gramming in the wee hours of the moming.
Yet, from out of New Jersey’s wasteland of
would-be actors comes a ressurected Uncle
Floyd, playing the cigar-puffing announcer
Eddie, looking every bit as Italian and
funny as Irememberhim in my early forma-
tive years.

With such an excellent cast, such a sub-
jectand such humor fleet of tongue and lip,
how can I tell you to stay away from this
movie? By all means, get into Charlotte
and take part in the fun. Laugh, cry, and
estimate your diminishing marginal return
over donuts.
