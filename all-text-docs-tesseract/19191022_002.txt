The University of Virginia eleven se-
cured a 7-0 decision over the V. M. I.
Cadets last Saturday. Leech and In-
gram,, V. M. I.'s fast backs, were stars
of the game. V. M. I. executed sev-
eral pretty forward passes and frequent-
ly threatened Virginia by this plan of
attack,

Georgia Tech eliminated Vanderbilt
from the Southern football championship
titles by defeating the Commodores 20
to o.. Flowers proved to be the particu-
lar star of the day, making all three
touchdowns and at times running thrir
the entire Vanderbilt team, on one oc-
casion for 70 yards and a touchdown.

With six varsity men out of the game
the’ University of North Carolina de-
feated Wake Forest by a score of 6 to o.
The game was played in a sea of mu
and rain. .

Washington and Lec defeated the
Norfolk Naval Base 78-0. N. C. State
a week ago defeated the Sailors 100-0.

Clemson was defeated by Auburn 7 to
0, but she deserves much credit for her
splendid playing and hard fighting spirit.

The University of Georgia defeated
the strong Sewanee eleven by a score of
13 to 0.

Possibly the biggest surprise of the
week in the realm of football was the
Syracuse defeat of Pittsburgh by a de-
cisive score of 24 to 3.

Furman defeated P. C. 6-0 and Wof-
ford the Citadel 12 to 0. Georgetown
33, U. P17.

N. C. State College downed Roanoke
College by a score of 78 to 0. Coach
Fetzer’s eleven used only straight foot-
ball and on only one occasion, with
nine substitutes in the game, did she fail
to make first down. Roanoke did not
make a single first down.

Great interest is being centered on the
N. C. State and Univ. of N. C. game
which is to be played in Raleigh, Thurs-
day, October 23; Both teams are in the
best of trim and are centering everv ef-
fort on this game. The teams are very
evenly matched in weight as may be seen
from statistics :

A Sunday School principal was trying
to make clear to his class the fundamen-
tal doctrines of the Declaration of In-
dependence. ‘

“Now, boys,” he said, “I will give
you each three ordinary buttons. Here
they are. You must think of the first
one as representing Life, of the second
as representing Liberty, and the third
one as representing the Pursuit of Hap-
piness. Next Sunday I will ask you each
to produce the three buttons and tell me
what they represent.” .

The following Sunday the teacher
said to the youngest member:

“Now, Johnnie, produce your three
buttons and tell me what they stand

for.”
“I ain’t got ‘em all,” he sobbed,
holding out two of the buttons. “Here's

Life, an’ here’s Liberty, but mommer
sewed the Pursuit o’ Happiness on my
pants.” —Ex.

CARELESS COOTIE!

A top sergeant called the doughboy's
attention to a cootie crawling up the
front of his coat.

The doughboy carefully picked the
animal off and placed it in side his coat.
“Get inside, you little fool!” said: the
private. ‘Want to catch pneumonia an

GEORGIA STILL MAINTAINS
LEAD IN DORMITORY
BASKETBALL.

North Wing, 24—Louisiana, 22.

North Wing Chambers defeated
Louisiana in a hard fought and_inter-
esting basketball game ‘Tuesday after-
noon by the close score of 24 to 22.

Although the Chambers team by
shooting many pretty shots from every
corner of the floor led their opponents
by several baskets, the younger dormi-
tory by good passing and team work re-
duced Chambers’ lead to one basket by
the end of the first half.

The second half opened with plenty
of “pep,” each team determined to
win, but neither team could top their
opponents’ score by more than one
basket. When the final whistle blew
Chambers led by one field basket.

Georgia 16—Rumple 10.

On Thursday afternoon Georgia add-
ed another victory to her list by win-
ning from Rumple 16 to to. The game
was characterized. by hard and rough
playing and inability to locate the bas-
ket. The game started with a rush and
Rumple caged the first three goals. Then
by a rally Georgia overtook her rival and
until the latter part of the half led them
by only two points. Then by stellar
work in the last half Georgia obtained a
safe lead.

Watts 31—Rumple 28.

Rumple threw a scare into Watts on
Tuesday by coming within three points
of winning, the score heing 31-28 The
combination of Rumple’s fighting spir‘
and Watts’ lack of teamwork made the
game exciting. The outcome of - the
game was in doubt until the end for
Watts had only a one-point lead thru
the game. As fast as Rumple took the
lead Watts would get it back with an-
other goal.

George Washington Johnson was
rather an obstreperous patient in an Eng-

“Don’t know why it is,” complained
the exasperated nurse, “but you colored

put together,””

“Yassam,” the patient agreed, “dat’s

Class of '23, are you homesick ?

Make up your minds, my boys, and stick.

Six weeks have passed and you're here
yet,

And at the end of the year you'll still be,

et,
Cause old D. C. has her charms and
her powers,
To keep you here ‘bout a million hours;
Don’t be yellow, boys; stick;
Pass vour work and never kick,
Hard lessons are only a part;
Make up your minds to toe the mark.
When you’re homesick and blue,
Know there's plenty more just like you,
And when you think of that girl, and
are sad,
Just think what D. C. is, and.be glad.

bly but expressed the will of the State,
and, since this will is so wisely recorded
in the establishment of this work of col-
lecting war records, it is the presump-
tion of the Historical Commission that
_the people of the State are going to give
the materials essential to history.

The fine success already attained by
_the public spirit of individual donors of
material shows that North Carolinians
want their State fully represented in
history.

Almost every person in the State has
a letter, a picture, or something that
would be of value. Whatever he has,
he should communicate information
about it, or send it to R. B. House, Col4

lina in the World War. R. B. House,
Collector of war records for the Histor-
ical Commission, is conducting this can-
vass by going to the sources of such offi-
cial records as Red Cross Chapter
Histories, Local Board reports, etc., by
organizing volut.teer committees to
assist him in various counties, and by
going himself from community to com-
munity all over the State.

These materials canvassed for, val-
uable as they are, will perish very rapid-
ly unless they are stored where fire, rats,
and other destroying agencies cannot
get at them. Practically the only safe
depository for such things is the fire-
proof Hall of History in Raleigh, builu
to preserve just such things as these.

Realizing the necessity of preserving
these valuable records, the last General
Assembly appropriated money for the
work, and directed the Historical Com-
mission not only to collect all data pos-
sible about North Carolina in the
World War, but to prepare a complete
