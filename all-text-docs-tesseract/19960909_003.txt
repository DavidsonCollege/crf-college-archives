Committee discusses new Union

By ALEX OBREGON
Staff Writer

One of the most frequented
buildings on campus, Davidson’s
College Union is the placé to go to
find friends, food, and entertain-
ment, and it’s a primary meeting
place for campus clubs and organi-
zations.

Since 1985 proposals have
been made to raise funds for a new
and improved union to better ac-
commodate the growing and
changing needs of students. Now,
eleven years later, these proposals
are finally becoming reality.

Organizing efforts to construct
new buildings or to renovate and/
or remodel old ones is a tedious
process. Planning for the new
Union, which will be located where
Johnston Gym now stands and
which will eventually replace the
current Student Union, is the job of
the Union Planning Committee,
which includes two students and

several members of the faculty. and
staff,

Committee member William
Brown says that construction of
the new union most likely will not

start for another five years, when it —

is estimated that there will be suf-
ficient funds for the project.

According to a policy of
Davidson’s Board of Trustees, in
order for a building or renovation
projectto begin construction, 100%
of the funds for that project must
be committed and 50% of the funds
must be in hand.

Fundraising efforts for the new
union are scheduled to begin next
summer, when fundraising efforts
for renovations and additions to
the Dana Science building will be
completed.

Plans for the design and lay-
out of the new Union are already in
the works.

This past summer, the Union
Planning Committee visited Duke

University, Elon College, and Ap-
palachian State University, to study
recently constructed or renovated
student unions.

Committee members say they
will visit several other colleges
this year and will meet with an
architect in order to finalize the
plans for the new union, so that
they will be ready once fund rais-
ing begins.

Rightnow, the committee says
it still unsure about how much the
project will cost.

Along with Brown, members
of the Union Planning Committee
include sophomore Jonathan
Sipling, senior Sara Beth Hamlin,
History Professor Sally McMillan,
Art History Professor C. Shaw
Smith, Richard Terry, Director of
Auxilary Services; and Davidson
College Trustee Gretchen
Johnston. Dean of Students Tom
Shandley serves as Committee
Chair.

Davidson-in-India departs

By ANN HATFIELD
Staff Writer

Last Thursday, fifteen students
left for the Davidson In India se-
mester abroad program. Held only
every other year, the program,
which takes place entirely in India,
consists of two months of study
and one month of travel. |

For the past two weeks,
Davidson In India participants at-
tended an on-campus orientation
which included two classes each
day during which students studied
India’s sociology, religion, and
economy. :

Professors Appleyard,
Mahoney, Sabaratnam and Martin
lent their experience and knowl-
edge to this orientation. In addi-
tion, students were debriefed on
food and hygiene and watched sev-
eral films.

Renu Jain, a student from
Brown University, says, “this week
was so relaxed. . .we got to know
each other and meet the Davidson

New science center to
break ground i in spring

~ Inanattemptto raise the stand-
ing of Davidson’s life sciences fa-
cilities, classes may begin in anewly
constructed Life Sciences Build-
ing, the future site of both the biol-
ogy and psychology departments,
as early as fall 1998.

According to the Office of In-
stitutional Advancement’s “Life
Sciences Report”, the Dana Sci-
ence Building has not been “seri-
ously upgraded” since the 1960s, a
time when Davidson was attended
by only about a thousand men. In
order to keep pace with the increas-
ing numbers of psychology and
biology majors, as well as rapidly
advancing technology, construction
of the building is considered a nec-
essary step for the college.

Biology was the second most
popular major of last year’s 384
graduating seniors, 54 of whom
majored in biology. Thirty-six se-
niors graduated as psychology ma-
jors, the fifth most popular major
choice.

The new Life Sciences
‘Building’s projected cost includes
$8.9 million for construction and a
$3 million maintenance endow-
ment. To date, about half of the
project cost has been raised in the
form of gifts and pledges from
alumni, parents, and friends of the
college.

The new building will bear the
name of Wayne M. AndCarolynA.

Watson, parents of Davidson
alumna Bryna Watson ‘82, who
gave generously to the project in
1995.

Toby Bethea, Vice President
of Institutional Advancement, says
that the project has received “‘noth-
ing but positive reaction. A lot of
students come from high schools
where the lab facilities are very
strong, and they expect that
Davidson, because of its strength
both in the sciences and pre-med,
should have strength in its science
facilities.”

Bethea expects that the new
building will help draw first tier
students sought by Davidson.

According to Bethea, con-
struction of the Life Sciences
Building will begin in the spring
of 1997, when the Trustees’ fund-
ing criteria to begin construction
should be met. Bethea states that
“hopefully, classes will [be held
in Watson] in the fall of 1998,” if
construction goes as planned, *

’ The 32,000 square-foot fin-
ished building will run parallel to
and in front of Dana.

Watson’s architectural style
will be consistent with that of
Dana, and the two buildings will
be joined by two covered walk-
ways and an esplanade.

Faculty expect that Watson
will provide a place where stu-
dents and professors of psychol-
ogy and biology will be able to
conduct research together as the
future draws those two fields closer
together.

will teach me about my Indian

‘Students will live at Madras

classes in Indian history, the In-

Indian issues. Each student will

tion. During the next several
months participants will travel to
