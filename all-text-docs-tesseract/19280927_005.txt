were rash enough to favor the Guil-

apparently angered at the way folks
low-rated them, tore into their guests
in typical Davidson fashion, mostly in
the final half, and ripped them wide
open. Some twenty-five hundred de-
votees of the game went away shaking
their heads wonderingly, for, after
reading Mr. Eddie Breitz for a week
or so, they had fully expected to see a
bunch of babbling babes take the field.

With the weather more suitable for
baseball than football, the Davidson
College Wildcats won their first game
of the season “from the Guliford
Quakers, 27 to 0.

Featuring the contest were several
long runs by the Wildcat backs and
the all-around work of ‘Sam Black,
acting captain for Davidson., Out-
standing for the visitors was the work
of their forward wall with’ Murphy
at left tackle showing the way.

Substitutions for Davidson were
frequent; while Guilford used only
four during the affair, Nine sopho-
mores saw service for the Wildcats
and gave promise of developing: into
valuable players before the season is
lover.

The score was ‘satisfying, since
it has been eight years or more
since a Wildcat team has put over
more than thirty odd points in an
opening game. As it was Tex used
nearly every warrior he had, and
in the general muddle the local
heroes passed up several good op-
portunities to score again.

“Sheaffer Pens and Pencils

Once again the cry comes out
for more track candidates. It’s
hard to see why Davidson can’t turn
out more than 30 men for pre-
liminary training at least. Now
is the time for all good men to
come to the aid of their coach and
prepare themselves to serve with
their feet. A man never learned
to run by parking them on the
radiator forever.

STRONG TEAMS
FACE DAVIDSON

After the game with the Citadel on
October 20, the fireworks will truly be-
gin for Monk Younger’s Wildcats. Not
depreciating the prowess of teams to
be played before this date, for there
is not a weak spot on the schedule, the
fact still remains that Davidson's chief
interest lies in games with the other
members of North Carolina’s Big Five.
Contests in this group are carded to
be played on almost successive dates,
only the clash with V. M. I. breaking
into the schedule of state games. Ey-
ery single melee will find the Wildcats
on their toes fighting hard for victory,
and in every case they will be pitted
against tremendous odds.

The first scrap comes on
27, when the Cats find
matched with Wake Forest at Char-
lotte. The Deacons are expected tobe
somewhat stronger than the eleven of
last year which tied Davidson at 13
