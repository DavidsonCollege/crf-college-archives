Joe “Big Dawg” Biggs
Davidson Football #66

Some of you may have noticed the
plans for the renovations that they put
up in Commons. I think they’re trying to
impress us or something, but let me, Joe
“Big Dawg” Biggs, tell you that the plans
suck. If they had asked the football team
how to design it, then we would have the
best damn cafeteria in the world. But
they hired some nerd, who designed it
for the dorks at Davidson who don’t
even need protein at their Commons
meals and probably. can’t even squat
200 on their max.

The first thing I noticed is that they
got rid of the football table. Now, I know

you all read my first essay or whatever,
but if you were too dumb to read it then
let me repeat: the football table is for
football players.

Use your brains, Commons design-
ers. If you get rid of the football table,
then where is the football team going to
sit? I'll tell you what, we're sure as hell

need. How about they just do whatever
they want to the rest of Commons, but
leave the football table where it is.

Heck, I don’t care if they paint the
whole place pink, as long as they leave
our table like it is now and don’t do any-
thing stupid to ruin it like they want to.
Also, maybe they can move the televi-
sion to the end of the football table, so
we can watch our competition on
“SportsCenter.”

While I was coming up with that plan,
I also thought of some other things they
should do in the renovations. One good
idea is to make a serving station just for
meat. If I know that I need to load up on
protein, then I don’t want to have to
look through a bunch of steamed cauli-
flower or something to get my meat that
I need. It would also be good if they had
special student-athlete lines so we could
get our food first, because we need it a

brother Reggie Foreman ’06. “The party

lot more.

Here’s another tip: make a Powerade
station. Then we wouldn’t have to wait
behind some out of shape dork getting a
Coke to fill up with the blue Powerade. If
they really want to be smart, they could
make it so that only athletes can go to
the Powerade station on the honor code
or something. Or, maybe .they can just
make it that you need to wear your foot-
ball sweatshirt to use the machine.

And, they could use new employees. I
want them to look into hiring the wait-
resses from
Vinnie’s.
That little
change
would make
Commons a
whole lot
better.

Speaking
of hot
chicks,
since we
have the
football
table and
the baseball
table, we
should have
a hot chick
table. I’m
sure the hot
girls would
like it,
because if I were a hot chick, I’d find it
disgusting to watch some ugly girl stuff
her mouth with corn dogs. Plus, sitting
the hot girls together would remove the
temptation to eat too much or visit the
ice cream machine. I’m a Sociology
major, so I know all about peer pressure
and temptations.

That brings me to. my next point: if
you're not a football player, then stay
the hell out of right field. It’s fine if a
couple non-athlete Phi Delts or some
hot chicks are out there, but it really gets
me pissed when there’s some dork
drinking our beer who probably doesn’t
even know the difference between short-
stop and center field. If we wanted to
watch the baseball games with dorks,
then we'd sit in the stands.

That’s all I’m going to write, because
there’s a “Dice Man” special coming on
that I want to watch. :

one after spring break. Everyone who
usually comes from other houses was off
working, and the freshmen were only
here because of pledging.”

Another brother agreed that, after the
first two or three drinks, Thompson and
Charles became the center of attention.
“First of all, British accents get a party
started in a hurry. Hearing some foreign
voices laughing drew a bunch of chicks
in and somebody put on the music, and

the next thing we knew there was the
best party of the semester,” according to
Brian Bradley 'o07.

With the party going, the guests
reportedly decided that it would not end
until nobody remained at the house.
While they admit to having been forced
to spend the night on the couch at two
different Martin Court apartments
Wednesday night, Thompson and
Charles otherwise declined to comment
on the situation.

Said Peter Cranz ’06, “I'll tell you
what, those Brits can flat out drink. At
first, I was confused seeing all these
European looking guys around who def-
initely didn’t go here, but when I found
out that they were the RSC actors, I just
wanted to talk to them and hear their
crazy party stories. They’re legendary, I
mean, they have those parties every
night in the 900 Room and empty the
taps.”

Jane Denton, the actress playing
Calpurnia, claimed that while many of
the cast members may be _ heavy
drinkers, they had never let it interfere
with their acting duties until this time.
“The two of them weren't at breakfast
Thursday morning, which was unusual
but hardly a concern: Then they still
weren’t at lunch, so I called both their
mobiles and got only monosyllables in
response. When they finally stumbled in
together, they were still wearing clothes
from the night before and looked
exhausted.”

Other company members agreed with
this description. Qne member, who
wished to remain anonymous, claims
that he overheard Charles on his phone
having the following conversation:
“Another party? Tonight? Oh, I don’t
think we can, we’ve got a show to do.
Well, I understand you're blowing off
psych but, yes, well, all right, we'll be
there, but keep it quiet, I’m supposed to
be working.”

About 40 minutes before showtime,
director Althea Vincent-Hughes
received a phone call from Thompson
effectively informing her that the two
actors were “unavailable” for the per-
formance.

Cast members from “Two Gentlemen
of Verona” made a hasty search of the
Davidson campus, but when one finally
found Charles and Thompson, each with
a case of Milwaukee's Best Light in their
arms, they were apparently not recep-
tive to the idea of returning to the play
and so continued down to the senior
apartments.

Study: cable in
dorms ameliorates
Searing pain of
Davidson life

According to a recent study by the
Davidson College Psychology
Department, the addition of cable to
dorm rooms has increased student sat-
isfaction by taking students’ minds off
the misery of their Davidson lives.

Said Associate Professor of
Psychology Chris Meetcher, “Through
our use of a student survey and with
interviews, we found that students use
the cable to enjoy some sort of mindless
entertainment to forget the personal
hells that are their lives at Davidson
College.”

He continued, “At many schools, the
exciting social scene, nearby city, or cul-
tural events provides a release from the
pressures of academic — work.
Unfortunately for Davidson students,
there is nothing to offset their enormous
workload. Thus, television becomes the
means for escape from their miserable
existence.”

Many students echoed Meetcher's
sentiments. Said Perry Markintosh ‘06,
“Before we had cable, I used to just sit in
my room and mope because I was so
unhappy. But now, for 30 minutes a day,
I can watch ‘The Real World’ and pre-
tend that I’m somewhere else fun, like
Arizona State.”

Lisa Siragusa '08 agreed, “The hour
of ‘The OC’ gets me through my week.
Watching beautiful people like Seth
Cohen reminds me that not everyone is
a cretin like the boys at Davidson. Plus,
for just a little bit, I can even forget thot
I probably have three 15-page papers
due the next day.”

Added Evan Crest '07, “Sometimes
I'll watch the Food Network and pretend
that I’m eating good food rather than
Beefaroni from Commons. Or, I'll watch
some cryfest on Lifetime or coverage of
the Iraq war, to remind myself that it
could be worse.”

Also popular among students are the
E! Network, for watching exciting par-
ties, MTV’s “Pimp my Ride,” and ESPN,
for watching other colleges’ sports
teams.

Many in the administration are
extremely happy with the results of the
survey. Said Dean of Students Kenny
David, “This survey proves that cable in
the dorms is working as advertised. Now
that students have a legitimate outlet for
relieving their stress at Davidson, there
should be a decrease in drinking alone
in the dorm rooms, crying in the Union,
running on the cross country trails, and
pleasure reading. I cannot imagine that
any parent in his or her right mind could
be displeased with the introduction of
cable in dorm rooms.”

Some students are unhappy about the
installation of cable. Said Sherie
Anatolia ’07, “My damn roommate is
always watching some crappy show
when I’m trying to work. If I have to see
another ‘Judging Amy’ I think I might
crack.”

The reliance on cable has also led to
some problems. For one, the nature of
the cable set-up, a satellite feed, is noto-
riously unpredictable, and can go out at
any time, especially in inclement weath-
er.
Remarked Lionel Smith ’06, “One
time it was raining and the cable went
out. After the initial confusion, I just sat
on my bed for 30 minutes crying about
how much work I had to do for that
week. In the past, I’d go socialize with
my friends or something, but at this
point, I’m just too dependent on televi-
sion to do anything else.”
