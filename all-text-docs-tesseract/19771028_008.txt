Drinking and alcoholism:
how do you swallow it’?

By PHILIP DUNCAN
News Editor
Do not deduce all-encom-
passing truths from the fol-
lowing comments of nine Da-
vidson students. I have con-
ducted no scientific poll on
alcoholism at Davidson.
Consider instead the locus
of your personal opinion on
this spectrum of diverse, ran-
domly-selected viewnrinte

‘When I was in high school
I did not_drink much—alcohol
was just not available. Then I
came here and went ape.”

This student explained that
since his freshman year he has
moderated his drinking habits
(which ‘‘definitely hurt me
academically’’) and now aver-
ages about two beers per night
six nights a week.

He views drinking as a form

of social interaction, ‘‘the easi-
est way to talk to people.’’ He
and some friends, several of
whom have ‘heavy drinking
habits’’ are the prime movers
of a new social organization on
campus. They gather infor-
mally in the 900 Room with a
special title.
“First there is ‘Mellow
Monday’,”’ he explains, ‘‘then,
‘Tranquil Tuesday’’’. In order
from there are ‘Wipeout Wed-
nesday,’ ‘Thoughtless Thurs-
day,’ ‘Fry-Day,’ and Satur-
day--well, Saturday’s the
weekend.’’ (And you know
what. that means.)

‘‘T’m a reformed alcoholic. I
used to drink a fifth of
whiskey every week--now I
drink about twice a week,
usually with meals.

“Why did I drink? Escap-
ism. At Davidson if you can
not have fun you can always
have alcohol. How and why
did I slow down? Stopping

* was not a single conscious
decision. It was a slow process
as I realized that I did not
enjoy waking up feeling like
shit, that drinking cost too
much money, and that my
problem did not go away.”’

a “moderate drinker” (as he
labeled himself) agreed that
“freshmen go wild--getting a-
way from home, blowing it
out, but insists that most
drinkers then taper off to
moderation. He revealed that
a friend of his was at one time
a problem drinker.
‘Depression over the two
g's--girls and gredes--drove
him to drink up.to a case of

beer a day.’’ Through personal
will and peer encouragement
the drinker conquered his
problem.

Another student does not
drink because his circle of
friends in high school never
started and because ‘“‘it’s not
something I want to do.”’ He
does not feel his social life is
missing anything because of
his abstinence, but he main-
tains that ‘‘you have to have
alcohol’”’ to stage a successful
social event on Patterson
Court.

“T think most people go to
those parties to drink...there
always seem to be more lined
up at the keg than on the
dance floor.

He complains of the distur-
bances and vandalism, perpe-
trated by some who drink too
much. ‘‘Being drunk is used as
an excuse to get away with
things.”

Another teetotaler who de-
scribed himself as ‘‘tolerant’’
of drinkers believes that use of
alcohol increases at college
because people ‘‘get excited
about the thought of doing
things you can not do at
home.”’

‘‘Freshman year I did not
drink much. Sophomore year I
drank heavily to relieve ten-
sion. Now I drink from habit.
I enjoy the social aspect and
continue to go to the 900
Room because my friends are
there.”’

She drinks six nights a
week, sees herself as a “heavy
drinker moving to modera-
tion,’’ motivated partially by a
desire to improve academical-
ly.

She too has friends who are
or were problem drinkers, ‘I
had a friend who was a very
heavy drinker until he woke up
one morning and the first
thing he said was ‘I want a
Scotch.’ That scared him.”

ey

‘“‘I do not see what the

problem with alcohol is. I just _

have a few Scotch and waters
after I get up and I do not
even think about alcohol until
after lunchtime.

Then on the weekends I go
through a few cases of Jack
Daniels—but I don’t feel that
it’s any big problem. When-
ever I get worried about it I
whip up a few daiquiris, sit
down and talk it out with my-
self.’

eh?

“Now you want to know
what I really think? I consider
myself a social drinker. I very
rarely drink during the week,
primarily because I can’t
spare the money or the time.
Maybe an occasional beer at
dinner after a flickerball game,
but that’s it.

‘“‘On weekends, I usually
enjoy a few drinks at a
cocktail party or a few beers in
the 900 Room because I like
the taste and because it rela-
xes me. But it is a means to an
end, not an end in itself. They
key to unwinding is the com-
pany of close friends and not
the alcohol.

‘‘T drink for two reasons.
First, because I like the taste.
Second, to get the tension out
of my body fast. This place

has contriputed to my drink-
ing—the tension gives me
another stimulus to drink.

“‘T’ve been drinking since
the eighth grade. My parents
were moderate drinkers; they
didn’t mind that I drank. It
was never a big deal for me—I
drank beer at family cookouts,
Jack Daniels—spiked eggnot
at Christmas parties, etc.”

In her early Davidson days
she went on ‘‘binges’’. ‘‘I’d
start with a couple of mixed
drinks, then follow them with
a few beers. Next I’d share
bottles of wine, pitchers of
beer, and fifths of bourbon
with a few friends.

‘I think my drinking is
more of a habit now. I don’t go
on binges like I used to.’’ She
now drinks every day; some
days one beer, some days six
or more. And that doesn’t
count special occasions when
mixed drinks, wine, and whis-
key supplement the beer.

“I spend about three times
more money on alcohol than I
do on food. <.. -vempege of
about $20 a week.

A

“There are stages of being
an alcoholic, level of alcohol-
ism.’’ She considers herself at
the lower end of the ‘‘alcoholic
scale; but believes she has a
healthy attitude towards drin-

king. ‘‘I’m aware that 1 could
not continue at this pace for
more than a year. People who
ignore their habit are in troub-
le. I tell myself now that I’m
an alcoholic so that when I’m
40 I won't be.

Her close friend at home
was killed by a drunk driver.
Contrary to expectation, how-
ever, she does not launch into
a tirade about the evils of
alcoholism. She is reflective,
wary, and not reactionary.

‘Drinking on campus is
pretty harmless, I suppose.
But I worry that it is breeding
bad habits for later in life.”’

She drinks sporadically —
once, maybe twice a week,
though ‘‘to be quite honest, I
wonder why I take a drink.”’

She knows friends who use
drinking as acrutch. ‘‘They

seem to be under the impres-
Por shy aga

sion that you need a false
stimulation to have a good
time. I wonder if it is a myth
that you have to have a drink
to have fun.”’

She doubts that a Court
party could be successful
without alcohol. ‘I think that
is a sad commentary. I don’t
go because everyone sits ar-
ound half-drunk.”

Recalling the memories of
people sick after drinking too
much, passed out on the floor,
suffering from hangovers, she
is baffled by those who OV-
ERIMBIc&. “> just-don’t
understand why people do it.”

BEFORE the 900 Room epened Scott predicted eac

would spend $1.50 on beer.

Query

When Davidson upperclass-
men returned to campus in
September, they discovered,
to the indignant surprise of
many, that one of their favor-
ite haunts, the 900 Room, had
undergone a modification. No
longer were they allowed to
come and go as they please;
positive proof of age was
required, either in the form of
a Driver’s license or a college
ID.

Ron Scott, director of ARA
Slater Dining Service, which
holds the beer and wine license
for the 900 Room. gave the
reasons for theach=-22 in
policy *.; aumittahce. ‘From
the inception of the 900 Room,

rises oO

we intended to have a door-
man present on nights that we
anticipated crowds. However,
for the past two years, neither
the Union Board nor myself
were satisfied.”

Scott said that the former
policy was simply inconsis-
tent. ‘“There was often a slack
attitude among some of the
doormen, Who would let_in
some without carding them,
and then turn others away if
they couldn't show proof of
age. It was Just an unfair
situation all the way around.”

Scott pointed out that he
