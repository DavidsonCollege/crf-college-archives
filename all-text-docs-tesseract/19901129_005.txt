D.A. Thompson | Rude Notes and Random Scribblings

Ho Ho This For Christmas Time

Yippee tie yay muthasanta! It’s
almost Christmas time again. I
love this time of year! Really,
what on earth could be better than
having to write a buttload of pa-
pers and taking far too many ex-
ams, but spending all the money I
don’t have buying presents for
people I don’t like? Damned if I
know.

How can one make this holiday
season bearable, then? I happen to
have an idea or two, but if I didn’t,
there wouldn’t be much of a col-
umn. Sohere they are, ten sure fire
ways to spice up a Christmas vaca-
tion with the family:

1) Order Dad a year long subscrip-
tion to Hustler, sign the card
“Candi”, and watch Mom have a
conniption.

2) Teach your little cousins to sing
“I Saw Mommy Doing Santa
Claus”,

3) Go to department stores in your
finest animal rights suit and throw
Reindeer blood on Santa. ~

4) Boost morale in the Persian Gulf
by sending our boys several thou-
sand copies of All Quiet on the
Western Front as a holiday treat.
5) Get a Christmas morning Strip-

O-Gram for Grandma.

6) Stand out on the sidewalk ask-
ing passersby if they’ve found
Jesus.

7) Make a present of your little
brother’s dog t6 that Cambodian
family down the street.

8) Have a Teenage Mutant Ninja

‘Christmas with Debbie Gibsonand

The New Kids.

9) Spit on your antiquated Auntie
Esther.

10) Worry about your rapidly
approaching grades.

I hope these tips come in handy.
But let’s not forget the highlights
from those Davidson those wish
lists!

Dr. Kuyukendall writes asking
Santa for aspothigher than 10thon
next year’s U.S. News survey,
unlike the former president of
American University who'd like a
little help with his phone bill.

Dean Terry is hoping for sev-
eral little devices, the description
of which good taste prohibits, and
anew kegerator for his office.

Junior Andrew Baker, along
with most of the male members of
Davidson’s faculty, wants a free
membership in the Hair Club for

Men.
Dr. Kuzmanovich has asked for
anew copy of Beach Blankef Bingo.
Senior Jeff Fraley is jus\dying
to win that New Kids look alike
contest,

Before I go, I’d like to share
this little anecdote from W.C.
Fields: "I believed in Christmas
until I was eight years old. I had
saved up some money carrying ice
in Philadelphia, and I was going to
buy my motheracopper-bottomed
clothes boiler for Christmas. I kept
the money hidden inabrown crock
in the coal bin. My father found
the crock. He did exactly what I
would have done in his place. He
stole the money. And ever since
then I’ve remembered nobody
onChristmas, and I want nobody to
remember me either."

If that’s not enough to put you
into the Yuletide mood, just re-
member the words of Kin Hub-
bard: "Next to a circus, there ain’t
nothin that packs up and tears out
any quicker than the Christmas
spirit.”

Merry Merry Folks! I'll be
back next term!

(Both quotations from: The
Portable Curmudgeon).

An Alumni's
View Of The Middle East Crisis

By DUNCAN MCBYRDE "33

As the Mideast imbroglio
began, one’s first impulse was to
laugh : having lived and worked in
the area for a few years, nothing
seemed surprising. One asked
jokingly “Hussein and Who’s In-
. sane?” “Is the Bush League really.
" going to try to play in the Saudi
sandlot?” “Is George really going
to interrupt his vacation to tee off
intothe Arabian sandtrap?” It must
have been anightmare: “I dreamed

‘I'd been taken by the Thief of
Baghdad, but then Iran!” “Well,
there’s no disputing about tastes:

_ what’s one man’s Mede is another
man’s Persian, on might say.”

however, by the bitter outcry with
a Palestinian accent: “They tell
Irag to get out of Kuwait, but they

won’t tell Israel to get out of the |

West Bank!” But we kept trying to

chuckle, hoping thechimera would "

vanish. To keep smiling, we even
dredged up Willard Espy’sancient

joke that an Arab would plyays 2

win in a camel race against a Jew,
because no matter how good a
camel driver a Jew was, the Arab

-would be a Bedouin.

But humor turned out to be
nothing but whistling in the dark,
and the chimera didn’t vanish but

‘Have we forgotten

Dean Rusk's warning

‘that we can’t forever

play den mother to the

world?

grew more homs and hoofs. Unan-

.  swerable questions took over: have
Our laughter was ‘interrupted,

we forgotten Dean Rusk's warning
that we can’t forever play den
mother to the world? Have we
forgotten Vietnam.. Grenada..
Libya..Panama? Inourimpulsive-
ness, have we abandoned all possi-
bility of negotiation, burned our
bridges, beaten our ploughshares
into swords, already passed the

pointofnoretumn?  .

Publisher Rolfe Neill of the
CHARLOTTEOBSER VER (Aug
19) points out that “Our ‘noble’
Mideast Venture Depends on
Who’s Defining It;” that in our

~ one-sided pro-Israel policy wehave |

tragically misunderstood and ne-
glected the needs of 200 million
Arabs inthe area; that we are send-
ing thousands of young military
personnel intd what they think is a
mission of honor and rescue, but
they are not prepared for the recep-
tion awaiting them, and needing a
better understanding of why in
many places they are booed in-
stead of cheered. And we shudder
to add to this the parallel hospital-
ity-in-reverse awaiting our civil-

jan countrymen in involuntary

exile. Since it seems a bit late to
say “with justice for all,” or “teach
us to understand,” or “teach us to
love,” maybe we'd better ask,

2?

“teach us to pray!
