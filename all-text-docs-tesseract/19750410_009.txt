The Davidson tennis team
fashioned a 6-3 victory over
Atlantic Christian College Wed-
nesday afternoon to run their
record to 8-6 for the season.

“I thought it was a very well-
played match and a very good
win for us,” commented Cat
mentor Jeff Frank. “It cer-
tainly is good to have this one
before going to Furman this
weekend.”’

The match with Furman
Saturday will be a key point in
the season for Davidson, as the
Palidins are rated as the second
best team in the Southern Con-
ference.

In the contest with Atlantic
Christian, Rick Quinby, the
senior team captain, took a
tough three-set match at the
number one singles position by
edging Bill Kent 6-1, 6-7, 6-2.

This was the third season that
Quinby and Kent have met,
previously squaring off at the
sixth and second spots the last
two years.

John Mitchell also took three
sets to win at the third singles.
He beat Asad Nizz 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, in
what Frank called ‘“‘a very good
win.”’ 1

Playing at the fifth singles
position, Stuart-Boswell gained

a victory over Gee Souls, 6-3, 7-. .

5, while Steve Holman crushed
Kevin Umstaedter 6-1, 6-0 at the
sixth position.

Chip Bondurant and Mike
Barnhill suffered losses for the

Cats.

In the doubles competition,
the Cats dropped the top slot as
Quinby and Boswell fell to Kent
and Pat Taylor by a score of 7-6,

‘6-3.

The other doubles were more
productive for Davidson. At the
number two position, Bon-
durant and Barnhill teamed to
take. a 6-4, 6-2 victory over
Rocky Peed and Nizz. The win
clinched the match for David-
son.

The third doubles match saw
Mitchell and Greg Dunn
emerge victorious over Souls
and Umstaedter, 6-4, 6-2.

On the overall play of the
team thus far this season,
Frank was full of praise and op-
timism.

“I certainly am_ not
discouraged with the play of our
boys at this point,’ he com-
mented. “‘Of our six losses, four
came to Dartmouth, Harvard,
Duke and UNC, all of which are
very goodteams.” __,

Noting that his squad was
primarily filled with young
players, Frank realized that
inexperience would be a
problem early in the season.
But he feels that the team is
maturing at a proper pace.
Naturally, he is concerned
about the conference situation.

“Right now, Appalachian
would have to be considered as
the top team since they have
beaten Furman and have most
of their top six players retur-
ning,”’ Frank explained.

Last Saturday the Davidson
College Rugby team faced both
Wofford and the Citadel in Spar-
tanburg. .In the noon game
against Wofford Peyton
Prospere started the scoring
with a 4-point try. The defen-
sive effort of the Cats, led by
Tom McKenzie. was fabulous.

Later, with a strong wind ad-
vantage, Wofford got. off a
tremendous kick. The ball
sailed past most ofthe David-
son. scrum, and only Carlton
Cooke, Bill Kelly, and Joe Craig
were left to face. the Dog on-
slaught. ‘They tried. but force of
numbers gave Wofford the try
and éxtra points and a 6-4 lead.

Davidson ‘was pushed in the
second half to contain a con-

taste victory

stant Wofford pressure, but the
Cats held on. Sheldon Parker
stopped a seemingly sure Dog
goal. Chris. Young raced
through Wofford’s line to score

the last Cat try. The field goal . ie

was good and Davidson won 10-
6.

Mike Stick broke the 4 o’clock
afternoon game with the Citadel
wide open in the early minutes.
He made a great try but it was
ruled no good.” Then the Cats
wavered and the soldiers grab-
bed a 6-0 lead. Marty William-
son played superbly at this
point and Pete Alford managed
the Cat's. scrum = with
precision. . He engineered a
long Cat try scored by Young.
Mark Armstrong — scored
another and Young made. the
third Davidson trv of the game.
giving the Cats a 16-6 victory.

“Since we lost to William and
Mary and beat Richmond, who
beat William and Mary, we

would look headedtoward a tie ©

for third in the conference.
Then everything would hinge on
the draw in the tournament.”’
The importance of the match
with Furman this weekend

becomes very apparent. Frank: ©

indicated that he thought there
was a good possibility that the
Cats could take the Paladins,
which would provide tremen-
dous momentum and con-
fidence for the remainder of the
season.

Frank emphasized that the
“kids are playing well right now
and are thinking positive.”’

He feels that the scrappy
mental outlook and aggressive
nature of play that the players
are exhibiting are instrumental
in the progress the squad has
made this season.

In assessing the performance
of the team thus far, Frank
made a very interesting ob-
servation. Whereas most teams
will have certain’ strong points
and other weak points, the Cats
do not seem to have any con-
sistently strong of Weak areas.

Frank clarified this
somewhat by saying, ‘We are
never sure ona given day e

our match points are coming
from. We have just been getting
good play from different people
at different times.”’

Individually, he has been im-
pressed with the play of Bar-
nhill and Holman who have won
the most matches.

‘Barnhill has been our
toughest and most consistent
player thus far,’’ Frank said.
‘But the real tests will come in
the tournament, and that is
where all the marbles really
are.”’

Regarding the conference
tournament, the Southern Con-
ference will be going to a new
format, similar to the one used
by the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference.

Each of the four first round
winners will move into the
semifinals, as has always been
the case. The losers will,
however, continue into a con-

solation bracket. They have

been eliminated in the past.

What this means is that the
victories in the first round are
more critical than in previous
years. A first round winner will
score five team points, even if
he loses both his semifinal and
consolation matches, placing
him fourth in the particular
seed.

A first round loser, on the
other hand, will tally only four
team points if he wins both his
ensuing matches, which would
