lack of scholarships blamed

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Davidson's womens’ bas-
ketball team lost a pair of
decisions to Pfieffer and North
Carolina State during the
week, dropping their season
record to 4-9.

N.C. State, ranked number
one in the state, completely
dominated the smaller Lady
Cats in rebounding and used
strong shooting performances
to win easily 91-62.

Donna Sherrill had an ex-
cellent night for Davidson as
she connected 12 out of 19
shots from the floor and hit
five of six free throws for 29
points.

She also led the team with
seven rebounds, seeing over 37

minutes of playing time.

Assistant Coach Ken
Schmaeder was very pleased
with Sherrill’s effort and, feels
that she is the key to the team.

“Donna Sherrill is figura-
tively and literally. the center
of our team. She plays very
hard and very solid basket-
ball,”’ he noted.

No other Davidson players
scored in double figures but
Beth Tanner had eight points
and Cindy Morrison five. Nora
McNeill, Renee Soos, Nancy
Matheny, Kat Morton, and
Babs Pattan all added four
points apiece for Davidson.

N.C... State was led ‘by
Christy Earnhardt with 22
points and 14 rebound and by
Susna Yow who had 18 points
and 15 rebounds.

State shot’ 49.3 percent
against Davidson's 41 percent
and out-rebounded the Lady
Cats 64-29.

‘‘We got totally out-re-
bounded and that really hurt
us. They've got a very talent-
ed team but I don’t think they
are the number one team in the
state,’’ Schmaeder com-
mented.

Earlier in the week David-
son lost to Pfeiffer for the
second time this season. Pfeif-
fer used steady play and took
advantage of a poor Davidson
second half to win comfortably
67-56.

Schmaeder felt the girls
played much better than in the
first meeting of the two teams
and was encouraged by the
improvement the team
showed.

‘It was. another one of
those games where we played
relatively well in the first half
and not so well in the second
half. They just slowly edged
ahead and broke our backs
with about ten minutes left in
the game,” he said.

Both Pfieffer and State are
scholarship teams, the type of
team that have handed the
non-scholarship Davidson
team a 4-9 record this season.

As a private school, David-
son is not required by Title IX
to give scholarships and
Schmaeder feels that this will
make ever winning at David-
son difficult.

‘‘We will not be able to
compete with the better teams
unless we also get scholarships
and it’s that simple,” he said.

The Wildcat track team
ended its regular indoor sea-

Lynchburg, Va., Saturday.

Davidson carried only an
eleven-man team to the Wake
Field House. The team defea-
ted Campbell College 55-36,

the Cats’ undoing, as by the
time the track events began
the score was 48-12 in favor of
Lynchburg.

Lynchburg swept the pole
vault and took three places in
the 35-lb. weight throw, the
shot put, and the long jump.

Davidson’s only victories in
these events were a first and a
third place for Milt McCurdy
in the shot and 35-lb. weight,
and a second for John Stan-

third for Carl McPhail in the

Distance events saved the
day for the Wildcats, who took
firsts in all individual races
above 440 yards. Mark Post-
ove won the 600-yard run with
a time of 1:18.7. Senior Fred
Borch won the mile run at
4:26.8, with freshman Doug
Horne a close second.

Horne took the 1000-yard
run a little later, and team-
mate Ed Anderson won the
880 with a time of: 2:08.5.
Borch claimed another victory
in the two mile run at 9:43.9,
and John Barksdale followed
in third place.

In shorter distances, Carl
McPhail led the 60-yard high
hurdle field at 8.0 seconds,
and Steve Justus took second
in the 440-yard run.

Davidson did not field
teams for the 440 or mile relay,
but a team of Horne, Justus,
Anderson, and Borch finished
far ahead of Lynchburg and
Campbell in the 2-mile relay at
a.time of 8:40.

The track Cats’ next action
will be the Southern Confer-
ence Indoor Meet at VMI
February 20-21, and they will
host Lynchburg in their first
outdoor meet March 18.
