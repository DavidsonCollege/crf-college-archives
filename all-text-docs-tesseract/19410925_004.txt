Administration Makes
Many Improvements

Anonymous Benefactor Gives

Robes To The College Choir
OFFICES REDECORATED

Inter - Office Communication
System Added

Among the chief improvements
the college noticed by upper-
classmen on their return to school
are the new furnishings in the
chapel and administrative offices.
Subdued green draperies have
been hung full length in all the
chapel windows. Each drapery is
caught back twice to effect grace-
ful lines and pleats. Most of the
money for the draperies was do-
nated anonymously by a patron of
Davidson College.
New Vestments

In addition the V@®&pers Choir
members are-now~ robed-in-maroon
vestments. These vestments were
also an anonymous gift to the col-
lege,

Venetian blinds, flowing draperies,
new and carpets
are the main additions to the ad-

in

furniture, plush

ministrative offices in Chantbers

Suilding Those offices’ redecor-

ated inelude that of Dr. Cunning-

ham, President of the college;
Prof. Bailey, Dean of Students;
Dr. C. K. Brown, Dean of Faculty;
Mr. Hengeyeld, Registrar; Miss
Steele, Secretary to the president;
Mr. Jackson, Treasurer of the col-
lege; and ~~ Miss¢s Jackson and
Brown, secretaries to the dean and
treasurer, respectively

In addition an inter-office com-
munication system has been set up

in the administrative offices. There-

much time and confusion are

| reported saved, creating more effi-

ciency.
