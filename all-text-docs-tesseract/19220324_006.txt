period the fair sex rules “the Hill,” and
even the honor roll grinds forget their

continually with the joyous call of.“Fire”

| REV. J. E. WOOL CALLED
| BY DEATH LAST SATURDAY

Last Saturday morning Rev. J. E.
Wool, father of James C. Wool, of the
laid down the sword of
Christian warfare and received from the
Master's hand the palm of eternal vic-
tory.

With heartfelt sorrow the students of
Davidson learned of the death of Mr.
Wool at Jackson, Miss. Death resulted
from influenza and the pneumonia into
which it déveloped.

Until only a few weeks ago Mr. Wool
was pastor of the Pegram Street Pres-
byterian Church, of Charlotte, where«he
served for three years, endearing him-
self to all who knew him. Recently he
and Mrs. Wool mpved to Jackson, Miss.,
where he went to become Superintend-
Missions in Central Mis-
Presbytery. He had just en-
tered into his new duties when he was
overtaken by sickness.

In addition to serving as pastor of
the Pegram Street Presbyterian Church
he was stated clerk Mecklenburg

(sears Also he
f Mallard Creek

Presbytery for severa
in Mecklenburg

had served as pastor

Presbyterian Church,

County, for three years and had been

pastor at Cornelius before coming to the

Pegram Street Presbyterian Church.
Mr. Wool was born at Nyack, N. Y.,

and had reached his sixtieth year when

death came. He was licensed to preach

»y East Hanover Presbytery, in Vir-

Senior class,

sissippi

| cinia, in May, 1886, and in October of

the same year was ordained a minister
by Roanoke Presbytery. His first pas-
terate was with Briery Church, in Prince
Edward County, Virginia, which he serv-
ed from 1886 to 1890, He was evangelist
of Abingdon Presbytery for six years

of the Synod of Virginia. He then moved
to Oxford, N. C.,, serving as pastor there
for five years and at Wilson-N.\C, for
a time, before coming to the Mecklen-
burg Presbytery. During the past seven
years he had served as pastor at the
churches of Cornelius, Mallard Creek,
and Pegram Street.

Mr. Wool was regarded by his asso-
ciates as a truly honorable, upright,
straightforward and God-fearing man of
highest Christian character. He was
known to a large circle of friends, all of
whom held him in the very highest re-
gard. His association with the people
of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County
won for him a warm place in their hearts
and it was with deep regret on the part
of his congregation, the Presbyterian
and other ministers, and the people at
large, that he left Charlotte to go to the
work which he was engaged in in Mis-
sissippi, a work which he felt offered
hitn a greater field for good.

The deepest sympathy of the entire
student body of Davidson goes out to
J. C in his great bereavement.
