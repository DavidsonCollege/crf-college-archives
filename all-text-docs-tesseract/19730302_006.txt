Union Officers Attend Session

By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

College Union President Joe
Earle and Vice Presidents Bon-
nie Hennesy and Tom Tornee
visited Cincinatti during a
recent weekend National En-
tertainment Contest.

The trio left Davidson on the
Sunday of Mid-winters and
returned on the following Wed-
nesday. At the convention they
saw a series of acts, exhibitions,

and seminar ideas that will be
considered for possible use in
future Union programs

Earle indicated that the time
at the convention is split bet-
ween actually viewing the acts
and meeting with other colleges
to discuss new ideas for en-
tertainment and programming.

‘‘We had hopes that we could

join with a few other North
Carolina schools and block-book
an act. This makes a more at-

ASU Discusses Calendar Change

Department chairmen at Appalachian State
University have discussed various curricular
systems at several recent open hearings on a
proposed calendar change. The advantages and
disadvantages of the 4-1-4 and the five-day quarter
systems were major concerns.

One chairman pointed out that a fatigue factor must
be considered in adopting the five-day system. Ap-
palachian now has a day off in the middle of the week.
Another faculty member said that the five-day quar-
ter system would cause a definite lab problem.
‘‘Students would be expected to attend labs whenever
they could fit them into their schedule, and this is
unrealistic’ he commented.

In discussing the 4-1-4 system, the department
chairman emphasized the economic problems that
Appalachian would face if such a system were adop-
ted. One professor said, ‘‘For small universities this
plan is perfect. But when the student enrollment ex-
ceeds 2000, such as ours does, it becomes increasingly
difficult to finance such a program. Appalachian
would lose a lot of money in the interim period, since
many of the students would probably be at home
working instead of attending the classes held during

this time.”

Dean Dudley, chairman of the Economics Depart-
ment, commented that several students had asked
why the university doesn't just have a big election on
the calendar change. However, Dudley emphasized
that this election ‘‘would reflect, perhaps, the most
popular, and not the most effective, system for our
university. Our task is to find the most effective

calendar for ASU," he said.

Campus Crime Rate Reduced,
Police Praised For Efforts

By JIM JERNIGAN
Staff Writer

The Davidson Police are hap-
py. Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze is hap-
py. The majority of the students
are happy.

Despite a nationwide boom in
campus crime, Davidson
College has drastically reduced
its reported crime rate. Only
$100 has been reported in theft
this year. Last year $3000 worth
was taken.

Many attribute this drop to
the presence of the Davidson
Police Force. Two officers are
on campus during the critical 10
p.m.-2 a.m. period. Statistics
show that most crime occurs
during this period, and on
weekends.

Officers Terry E. Springs and
J. M. Griffin feel that the anti-

police attitude expressed by
Gray Wilson in last week's

tractive proposition for the per-
former, and it cuts our ex-
penses,’’ Earle stated.

After the three returned from
Cincinatti, the entire Union
Board met to discuss the
coming year's social offerings.
They approved a thematic ap-
proach to scheduling of the
various programs and concerts.

The three themes for the year
will be a massive approach to
comedy, a study of the future,

and an investigation into
changing values.
“These programs will

hopefully involve all the dif-
ferent aspects of the campus
from the ROTC department to
the chaplain,” said Earle.

“The Union is primarily a
collection of funds for students
to spend. They can make
proposals, or offer criticisms.
There is no reason why we can-
not have anything that we want,

A REVIEW

By ROBERT BOLICK
Staff Writer

You say you've got the blues,
feel rundown, iron-poor blood?
Don't spend your two and a
quarter on Geritol; take it down
to the Charlottetown Mall and
see ‘‘Steelyard Blues,”’ perhaps
the funniest movie since
*M.A.S.H."’

Donald Sutherland registers a
beautiful performance as
Veldini, a loser with a penchant
for grabbing the nearest vehicle
and entering the first
demolition derby he can find.
His ultimate goal? Why, his own
derby track with events for
campers, busses, pick-ups,
Macks, and even mobile homes.

The conflict centers around
Jesse Veldini's knack for get-
ting in jail and his brother
Frank's (Howard Hessemann)
desire to become attorney
general of the state. The scan-
dal won't do, so dear brother
Frank sets Jesse up in business
as chief cage cleaner at the
local zoo, but that doesn't pan
out for Jesse who has other
things up his pant's leg.

DAVIDSONIAN was not shared
by the majority of students.

Both Springs and Griffin
believe that the operation is
much smoother now that they
know many of the students.
And most students report little
or no police harassment.

The police are authorized to
enforce any state law. They will
not however, enter a dorm
unless specifically requested to
by a student. But recently they
apprehended three outsiders
stealing tape decks in Belk
Dorm after a student had called
them into the dorm.

The police are sensitive to
any form of property damage
and to careless driving. Often
they stop cycle riders without a
helmet.

They are easy on beer laws
and drunks. Unless a flagrant
exhibition of marijuana is
shown, smokers will not be
bothered.

provided that we can afford it,”
he said.

Earle said that the Union
board was hopeful that they
could enlist support from the
Reynolds lectureship to bring
some speakers to campus who
are clearly worthwhile from an
academic standpoint.

‘Ramsey Clark was a good
example of this. The entire
Corrections Symposium was
engineered outside of the Union
by an interested student, Bob
Wallace. It was funded by the
endowed Reynolds Lec-
tureship,"’ he said.

Earle revealed that the
Keynote Speaker at the Cin-
cinatti convention was Artie
Shaw. Others who made ap-
pearances were Christine
Jorgensen, who is available for
public addresses and the
February bunny from
‘Playboy Magazine’ who was
selling subscriptions.

No major problems have
resulted from the increased
presence of females on campus.
However, several local Peeping
Toms have been evicted from
the bushes surrounding Little
Dorm.

Meetze felt that the lack of
complaints and the attitudes of
both students and police are im-
portant indicators of the
program's success. He said that
the slight rise in the security
operating budget is more than
justified.

Some problems did come with
the daytime use of student
patrolmen earlier in the year.
A few student cops were
threatened, kept awake by ob-
scene phone calls and were spit
upon.

Meetze gives full credit to the
Student Security Council under
the leadership of Mitch Purvis
for making the system work.
The Council meets once amonth
and promptly considers all
complaints.

‘Student participation is the
best thing that ever happened to
this college,"’ declared Meetze.

“With the 18 year old vote,
students are citizens. The
college is not off-limits to the
laws we all make. Without
regulations people will not
discipline themselves ,"’ he con-
cluded.

Besides being better trained,
the town cops are fully equipped
with walkie-talkies whenever
they leave their patrol cars.

They have just completed a
course covering all aspects of
police work offered by Central
Piedmont Community College.
It is now required by state law.

Officers Springs and Griffin
expressed the desire for more
student concern over outsiders
in the dorms. ‘‘The fewer unin-
vited outsiders allowed in the
dorms, the better off the
inhabitants will be," they
declared.

To ‘Steelyard Blues,’
Funniest Movie Since ‘MASH’

These other things involve the
rest of a hilarious cast. Enough
cannot be said for the Eagle
(Peter Boyle), who is a nut of
all trades. Boyle's Brando and
John Wayne impersonations
are full worth the price of your
seat.

Garry Goodrow as Duval
Jack displays considerable
comic talent and more than
holds his own with Boyle and
Sutherland.

Jane Fonda, one of Veldini's
true loves, gives an uneven per-
formance as the stereotype
“fallen woman with a heart of
gold."’ In one superb scene,
however, she smoothly puts bad
guy Frank on ice, rather she
puts the ice on him via an open
fly.
‘“Steelyard Blues"’ is not
much more than a gag movie
though, making asides to the
audience about infringement on
personal rights, the right to
privacy and to be different.

For the characters of this
movie, those rights amount to
the right to be crazy, to be a
whore, to steal cars, and,
generally, raise hell.

The gag nature of Steelyard
Blues stands out as one of
Sutherland's major debts to
“M. A. S. H."' in directing this
film. Sutherland has, however,
made a move away from the

comedy that put him in the top
bracket of actors.

That move consists of
warmth. The warmth in his own
characterization and the
warmth that seems to havebeen
directed into the performances
of Goodrow and Fonda set this
movie apart from the cold
zaniness of ‘‘M. A.S. H."'

This warmth seems to be a
new trend for comedy these
days. For instance, there is a
great deal more humanity in
the television version of
**M.A.S.H.” than in the movie
version. It's also manifest in
“Sanford and Son" and ‘All in
the Family."

At any rate, Steelyard Blues
gets a ‘‘see it twice” rating
from this viewer. Look forward
to strong performances by the
male cast, Ms. Fonda's being
there, and good, corny, country
music by Bloomfield, But-
terfield, and Kahn.
