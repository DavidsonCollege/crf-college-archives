Alexander’s “Rising, Shining America”

The citizens of New Hamp-
shire and Iowa can now return to
their normal lives, having per-
formed the quadrennial function
of whittling down the field of presi-
dential candidates. The field, eight
strong just two weeks ago, is now
composed of three: Bob Dole, Pat
Buchanan, and Lamar Alexander.

Most Americans are familiar
with Dole, in his third presidential
campaign, and Buchanan, in his
second. The voting public has
formed opinions about these can-
didates, and for many those views
are negative. Dole’s inability to
achieve his very modest goals. of
receiving 30% of the vote in lowa
and winning New Hampshire by
any margin indicate his lessening
popularity.

Buchanan’s isolationist, -and

- sometimes prejudiced, rhetoric
plays well with only a minority of
Republican voters and repulses
most mainstream conservatives.

For these and other reasons,
many Americans have decided to
examine Lamar Alexander as a
possible candidate. While many
already have discovered Lamar

_ and his vision to lead the nation
into the 21st century, others are
still trying to learn about the man
and his beliefs. For those just
discovering Lamar Alexander, I
would like to share with you
Lamar’s background and his vi-
sion.

Lamar Alexander served two

terms as governor of Tennessee.
During that time, he balanced eight
consecutive budgets while main-
taining the nation’s fifth lowest tax
rate. He recruited companies such
as Saturn and Nissan, thus creating
jobs by changing Tennessee from
a state which had never produced a
car into the

date with the strongest vision of a
rising, shining America.

While other candidates for
President embrace the 1920s no-
tion of isolationism and trade walls,
Lamar Alexander sees the value in
an internationalist approach. As
governor, he encouraged foreign

can America flourish in the next
century.

Lamar Alexander also be-
lieves that the federal government
must show greater responsibility
in its budgeting process. This is-
sue holds particular importance for
college students who will inherit

administration.
He created a child care business
that now employs over 1,200 work-
ers. Lamar Alexander balanced
his service in Washington with gov-
ernance in Tennessee, and work in
the business and academic worlds.

Experience is an important
quality for any candidate seeking
the presidency; however, vision
and ideas are equally desirable.

to fiscal responsibility, internation-

can people make him the candi-

Stop the

whining

“Ugh; [have so much work to
do.” Gee there’s a phrase I have
never heard before. It is often
followed up by something like, “T
have eight papers, five reviews,
and three problem sets due tomor-
row, and I haven’t started any of
them.”

Davidson students have mas-
tered the art of complaining about
their workload. The biggest prob-
lem with this is that they practice
this art on other Davidson students.
It is rather useless to complain
about all the work you have to do to
someone who has just as much, if
not more, work. Yet, not a week
goes by without overhearing
someone’s long, drawn-out list of
torturous tasks they have yet to
accomplish.

This is most definitely one of
my biggest pet peeves about
Davidson. I really do not care to
hear about all the work you have to
do. I understand completely what
you are going through because I,
like every other Davidson Wild-
cat, have been there, too. If sym-
pathy is your goal, this is the wrong
way to go about attaining it. How
can I really sympathize with you
when I am busy worrying about
how I am going to research my
psych term paper when the library
~ closed half an hour ago?

Using extra-curricular activi-
ties as an excuse is equally weak.

Every student seems to be involved
is some club, activity, or sport.
After all, twenty percent of
Davidson student play a varsity
sport. If you think you are the only
one being picked on by your pro-
fessors, you’re wrong. Everyone
here gets picked on indiscrimi-
nately.

I especially dislike it when
people complain when it is their
own fault that they have so much
work and so little time. We stu-
dents like to watch our Must See
TV, attend women’s basketball
games, run to the Union, and so on.
We doeverything we can to put off
our projects until the very last
minute. Procrastination is not a
good thing, but it almost inevitably
occurs. When it does, please do
not come crying to me about all
that you have to do before five.
Just be a big girl or boy, dive in,
and get it done.

The next time someone asks ©

how much work you have, just say,
“I am a Davidson student” and
then refer to ourrating as the school
with second heaviest workload in
the nation. Instead of wasting en-
ergy griping, channel it. Whip
through thatchemistry problem set,
or burn it off by reenacting Self-
Selection Night inthe library. And
realize that going to Davidson and
having an insane workload go hand
in hand.

investment in Tennessee, creating
high skilled, high paying jobs.

His trade beliefs also benefit
the people of America by opening
foreign markets to American
goods. The Saturn cars made in
Tennessee will now be sold in
Tokyo.

Like many Americans, Lamar
sees the burden placed on Ameri-
can society by illegal aliens. How-
ever, contrary tosome of the party’s
extremists, Lamar realizes that this
nation benefits from the contribu-
tions of legal immigrants.

He feels that by controlling
the illegal immigration, prejudice
against all immigrants will be less-
ened. Only through a policy of
free trade and openness to others

Fi -
nally, Lamar supports the continu-
ation of college loans as outlined
in the Republican balanced budget
proposals. Contrary to White
House claims, the proposal would
increase money for college loans
by 50% over the next seven years.
By exercising fiscal responsibil-
ity, Lamar Alexander will reduce
the burden of massive debts and
higher taxes which awaits our gen-
eration.

Perhaps Lamar Alexander’s
most exciting idea, and the most
important of his campaign, is re-
turning responsibility to the states
and the people.

For instance, Lamar laments
the recent welfare reform bill,
which replaced Democratic fed-

eral regulations with over 800
pages of Republican regulations.
He realizes that Washington can-
not adequately reform welfare,
because solutions for Washington,
DC, or New York do not always
work in North Carolina. He thinks
‘that the states should have the flex-
‘ibility to solve their unique prob-
lems with their unique solutions.
Lamar also recognizes that local
groups can better serve their neigh-
borhoods than the federal govern-
ment.

He would provide a tax credit
up to $500 for contributions to
charitable organizations, allowing
the money to be injected straight
into local communities rather than
being sent to Washington. This
principle rests on the sound as-
sumption that $500 given to the
local soup kitchen will feed more
people than the same amount of
money thrown into the federal bu-
reaucracy.

Lamar will help shape an
America where we expect more
from ourselves and less from Wash-
ington, DC.

The Republican nominating
process comes to the South in the
next two weeks. Voters have three
choices: the status quo, change
based on fear and anger, or change
based on hope and promise. _—

Lamar Alexander is the can-
didate of hope and promise with
the ideas to improve the lives of all
Americans. I invite you to “come
on along” and join the campaign
with the vision to restore America’s

prosperity.

The meritous keg

The passing of the keg. Cer-
tainly, this devastating news
brought many a tear to the eyes of
Davidson students, faculty, and
alum who enjoy sipping a cold
beer in a non-threatening social

environment. The keg, indeed,
holds a certain esteemed place in
the hearts of the Davidson com-
munity, as well as colleges and
universities the world over.

The self-study proclaimed,
“The college should ban the use of
common containers, including
kegs, for any student social func-
tion on campus.” Outlawing the
beer barrel on the court will surely
reduce the college’s liability, ap-
peasing the insurance agents sip-
ping their ‘Zima and Bartles &
James. I only hope that they have
weighed the consequences of rid-
ding this common and convenient
method for dispensing ale.

Kegs inspire academic and in-
tellectual growth. So much of what
we study here at Davidson is em-
bodied in the concept of the keg.

Asa matter of Economics, the
purchase of kegs demonstrates a
comprehensive knowledge of stu-
dents trying to apply such prin-

ciples as supply and demand, cost-
benefit analysis, and smart invest-
ing. Chemistry and Physics virtu-
ally flow from the kegs tap —
giving direct examples of the Ideal
Gas Law, Bernoulli’s Principle and
Chemical Equilibria.

One can barely comprehend
the Math wrapped up in the keg:
adding, multiplying and deducing
the numbers representing people
served, beers remaining as well as
conversions between ounces,
quarts, and gallons of alcohol.

Many have found Religion
while pumping the plunger of a
keg.

The big, silver barrels also
have played the role of match-
maker to many longing a signifi-
cant other. Cupid’s arrows have
pierced students’ hearts as they
wait in line for their beer, eyeing
the girl they’ve seen in class, too
scared to speak, the guy they’ve
seen down at Baker trying hard to
improve that physique. It is doubt-
ful such romances are kindled
across a frosty mug of Busch Light
Draft.

Athletics will also be severely
affected with the keg’s extinction.

Keg softball, a virtual institution,
will never'be the same. Running
the bases isn’t as motivating when
all that awaits at second are some
warm cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon.
Such Rugby mainstays as “‘shoot-
ing the boot” and “naked keg toss-
ing” will be replaced with seeing
who can throw a bottle of Colt 45
the farthest. Certainly something
will be lost in the keg’s absence.
Possibly the most overlooked
asset of the keg is its versatility.
Kegs can be fantastic furniture
additions. The aesthetically pleas-
ing unfinished metal complements
any decorative setting. Beer kegs
are also great ballast for hot air
balloons. Flying too low? Just
toss a barrel over the side. The
empties truly make great gifts. My
roommate was pleased the day he
found an empty keg in his bed.
Possibilities abound with the
money from the keg deposit.
Davidson, speak up and fight
back. Let’s save the keg and our
right to drink from acommon well.
The time will come when we no
longerhave the opportunity to share
beer with our brethren. We must
savor what little time we have left.
