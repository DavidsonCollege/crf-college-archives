There will be no admission
charged students for any bas-
ketball games played at the
Coliseum next year, THE DAV-

In addition, Dr. Tom Scott, di-

student seats would be concen-

Free Tickets For Coliseum Seating Brings Controversy To

There will be no balcony seats.

Faculty seats will be on the
opposite side of the Coliseum.

Scott's decision apparently
terminates a _ three-month-old
controversy which arose over
students’ being charged to at-
tend games with St. Joseph's
and New York University,
earlier this year.

The News And Editorial Voice Of The Davidson College Student Body

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., FRIDAY, APRIL 29, 1966

In February, Dr. Paul A. Mar-
rotte, chairman of the Faculty
Athletic Committee, pointed out
that in February, 1965, that the
committee agreed that student
tickets to the Coliseum should be
free when school is in session.

But Marrotte told THE DA-
VIDSONIAN this week that con-
trol over policy of charging for

tickets rests with Dr. Scott.
“The committee can only rec-
ommend policy.’’ Marrotte said.
However, Marrotte pointed out
that the committee does have
final approval over such mat-
ters as scheduling.

Scott said that his department
had always previously gone on

the policy that students should
be admitted. to 10 home games
free, classifying Coliseum games
as home.

“Dr. Scott had been working
under this 10-game rule, and
that is his authority,” Marrotte

said. ‘However, the committee
didn’t realize that he was work-

ing under this.”

There are currently 10 home
games set for next year, includ-
ing five in Johnston Gym and
five in the Coliseum.

There will also be two games
during Christmas recess in the
Charlotte Invitational Tourna-
ment, but students will have to

pay full prices for adniission to
the tournament.

Marrotte pointed out that there
is an open date in February on
the schedule and that Scott has
been authorized to schedule a
game in the gym for that date.

If this date were filled, there
would then be 11 home games,
which under the old policy would

force students to pay admission
for a Coliseum game.

But under the new guidelines,
students will see the 11th game
free, should it be scheduled.

Dr. Scott pointed out that half-
price date tickets will be sold at
gym games, but that students
will have to pay full price for
date tickets to the Coliseum.

Dr. Burns

Justifies

Vietnamese Policy

“U.S. intervention in South Vi
et Nam is fully justified.’ stated
Dr. James MacGregor Burns
Tuesday. Burns made this state-
ment during and. following the
chapel in which he discussed
U.S. foreign policy from Viet:
Nam to Africa and Cuba.

Dr. Burns described the inter-
vention as an effort to maintain
the pragmatic strategy of hold-
ing lines between the great op-
posing world powers which was
the “implicit assumption and ex-
pectation of the Geneva Accord
of 1954." Burns stated that the
Communist backdown from the
Berlin blockade and the Cuban
missile crisis prove the effec-
tiveness of ‘such a temporary
strategy.

From agreement with the U.S.
military program in Viet Nam,
Burns went on to a critique of
the socio-economic program of
aid to foreign countries. Again
using Viet Nam as an example
Dr. Burns stated that in many
situations, military victories in
certain sectors were cancelled
by the ineffectiveness of subse-
quent social and economic pro-
grams in these areas. He said
that, despite ‘‘big talk by Eisen-
hower, Kennedy and Johnson,
the “economic aid program to
South Viet Nam is still falter-
ing.”

Speaking about aid in general,
Burns said that “in our aid pro-
gram we should be hard-headed
and revolutionary.’’ The fact that
the Peace Corps has been such
a success both abroad and in
terms of Congressional approval
is éncouraging, but wholesale
student exchanges and commu-
nications between the different
social groups (i.e. professional
and labor) in a wider variety of
countries should be encouraged.
He would also support a multi-
lateral aid distribution agency.

Burns stated that the belief in
a “Why should outsiders inter-
fere?"’ philosophy has caused an
immense amount of misery. He
said that nations are not always
successful in solving their own
problems without the help of oth-
ers. While agreeing that U.S.
policy in the ‘banana repub-
lics’’ of South America may

have been exploitative,. Burns
nevertheless believes that a
country can maintain several
mutually exclusive strategies.

being exploitative yet humani- ; :

tarian in a country such as
India.
Burns characterized America

as ‘a basieally revolutionary .

country” as a result of our own
political revolution against Bri-

tain and the many peaceful revo- g

lutions which have occurred
Since then. Too many people
have a “terribly narrow view of
revolution which doesn’t include
a: lot which doesn’t come under
the Marxist aspect of revolu-
tion,” stated Dr. Burns. He said
that we must learn not to fear
revolutions but instead attempt
to influence them for the good
of the people involved as well
as that of the United States.

James MacGregor Burns, his-
torian, author, politician, and
professor, spent Tuesday and
Wednesday on campus lecturing
and discussing his strategy for
peace and its application to Viet
Nam, the revolution in Amer-
ican politics, and his own ca-
Teer.

Speaking in chapel Tuesday,
Burns introduced his analysis of
the contemporary world situa-
tion and the basis of future
world peace. He stated that the
three plans for permanent peace
introduced in contemporary his-
tory, Hitler’s Nazi plan of world
conquest, Communism and pac-
ifism, have all failed.

Instead, a plan for temporary
peace was developed at the Ge-
neva Accord of 1954. Although
not implicitly stated, the major
powers in effect agreed to main-
tain peace on the basis of fences
between the different spheres of

Releases Rush Rules

Second semester rush and
“fairly unrestricted’ contact be-
tween freshmen and fraternity
members highlight the 1966-67
rush regulations drawn up Mon-
day night by the Interfraternity
Council, fraternity presidents
and fraternity rush chairmen.

The meeting, acting on the
premise of dissatisfaction with
the former set-up, as well as on
several faculty recommenda-
tions, shortened and overhauled
the rush schedule and specified
measures to promote more ‘‘nat-
ural contact.”

David Westfall, newly-appoint-

ed chairman of the Rush Com-
mittee, announced that copies of
the rules would be available for
distribution next week.

Bill Rikard and Bobby Vagt
were named along with Westfall
to the Rush Committee; Tommy
Cox, chairman, and Rick Mild-
ner.and Tommy Caldwell to the
Planning Committee; and Ben

political control and “real es-
tate deals.”

PRAGMATIC STRATEGY

This policy was not designed
as a plan for permanent world
peace but instead is a pragmat-
i- strategy which thus far has
w. ‘ked.

Although he does support a
ground war, Burns opposes the
area bombing of North Viet
Nam because both its effective-
ness is disputed, and it is incon-
sistent with the hold-the-line
strategy.

In the coffee hour Burns cited
precedents in other crisis condi-
tions where the, “fence” strat-
egy has worked in Berlin, Cuba,
and Korea. He stated that the
U.S. needed a hard-nosed but
revolutionary outlook in foreign
policy.

Tuesday evening Dr. Burns
spoke in Hodson Hall on the sub-
ject of the American Political
Revolution, taking issue with the
popularly accepted notion that
America is in two party poli-
tical situation. He said that in
fact. both the Democratic and
Republican parties are further
divided into Presidential and
Congressional parties.

PROGRAMS THWARTED

Burns said that while Presi-
dent Kennedy was able to push
some very significant legislation
through Congress, some. of his
most important programs were

thwarted because of the rival-

ries between the Presidential and
Congressional factions of the
Democratic party.

The reason that President
Johnson has had suf cee
with his legislative program is
that the Democratic Presiden-
tial party is in the majority. The
results of this majority have
emphasized a trend in American
politics, the emergence of a
strong presidential government.

Dr. Burns does not see this de-
velopment as a threat to person-
al liberty. Instead, because the
Presidency more than any other
governmental body expresses the
consensus of American opinion,
it is one of the primary defen-
ders against encroachments on
personal freedom. Instead of the
former checks and balances,
Burns stated that three external
checks have arisen outside the
governmental system.

Burns cited the Bill of Rights
protection of free speech and the
excellence of journalism, fair and
honest elections, and a strong
opposition party as newly
emerged checks.

FUTURE PREDICTIONS

Burns ended his lecture with
three hesitant predictions on the
future of the American political
system. He stated that. Congress
will remain Johnsonian through
1966. However, “‘unless Johnson
intervenes dynamically in the
1966 campaigns.’ he will not
maintain the necessary control
over Congress ‘to continue the
state of Presidential power which
exists today. This will cause the
reappearance of muti-party pol-
itics and the subsequent dead-
locks for perhaps the next 10
years.

Eventually, Burns feels that
America will revert permanent-
ly to Presidential power and
eliminate 4-party politics. Asked
about the future for federalism.
or state influence in the coming
system, Burns replied that such
influence would decline, but the
pluralism which federalism has
formally represented will be
expressed in different ways.

Tuesday morning Dr. Burns
spoke to the History 74 class on
the subject of writing histories
and the difference between the
long-term influence of history
books as opposed to novels.

Students To Vote

About Rules Court

Monday
Vote
Disputed

Paul Marion, Senior Class
President. announced yesterday
that students will vote again on
the proposed Student Regula
tions Court because the exact
extent of the power delegated to
the Student Council to establish
such a court in Monday's refer.
endum was unclear.

In the vote to keep or repeal

was repealed 426 to 110, while
the hazing rule was kept by a
vote of 283 to 258.

According to Marion, the re-
sult of the referendum gave the
Student Council authority to
make the necessary changes in
the Student Body Constitution
to establish a Student Regula-
tions Court.

Questions about the constitu-
‘tionality of the exact nature of
the authority have led the Stu-
dent, Council to interpret the
vote as giving power to draw up
proposals for the court which
must then be approved by the
student. body by a_ two-thirds
vote as any amendment to the
constitution.

At its Monday night meeting
the council .will determine the
specific amendments that must
be made to legally form the
court. Students will vote on the
proposal ‘‘about a week later,”
according to Marion.

The court will consist of the
presidents of the three upper
classes, the Freshman Advisor,
and the Vice President of the
Senior Class. The Senior Class
President will serve as Chair-
man.

The new court will use the
same system as the Honor
Court. The Investigating Com-
mittee will look into the facts
of any violation, and the defense
of the accused will be directed
by the Defense Advisor.

From anybody else it would be

There was a long silence.

“Well, maybe you've heard of
