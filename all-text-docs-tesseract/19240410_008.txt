THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 10, 1924 :

INTEREST INCREASES

(Continued from page 1)
overshadow the cabaret feature of last
year’s Speaking.

Sunday will be devoted to especially at-
tractive religious services, which include
a special “Y” meeting in the evening. At
this service, the newly elected “Y” of-
ficers for next year will be publicly in-
stalled.

The Junior Class started arrangements
for the gala occasion several weeks ago,
and the plan has steadily gained im-
petus, until now all signs point to four
days of unexcelled joy for all present.
All fraternities are planning special social
functions and receptions for their guests,
a large number of whom are expected.

Mrs, F, L. Dendy and little sons have re-
turned to Davidson,

RACE PROBLEM IS AGAIN
TOPIC FOR STUDY GROUPS

The topic for the discussion group mect-
ings last Sunday was “The Negro Problem
in the South.” It was pointed out how the
negro question affected the whole South, and
some of the means whereby conditions could
be bettered were discussed.

These discussion groups. meet every Wed-
nesday night on each hall of the dormitorics,
and some part of the racial question is dis-
cussed. The men attendingthese meetings
become better acquainted with the means of
handling the important questions brought up.
The topic for the next meeting is “The Im-
migration Problem.”

Professor Fleagle has charge of the class
of leaders, and each leader learns all he can
about the topic before he attempts to teach
it to his group.

There will be no meeting of the classes on
Wednesday, the 16th, as many of the men
will be away for the spring vacation.

|MINISTERIAL BAND HEARS
DR. LINGLE ON SUNDAY
| In opening his talk to the Ministerial
| Band last Sunday evening, Dr. T. W. Lingle
stated that he had not come there as an or-
|dained minister of the Gospel but as one
|who had had the privilege of hearing a
| great many sermons from a great many
| preachers. He then went on to distinguish
between the three types of preaching into
| which he believed most of these sermons
| fell.

| The first of these was evangelistic preach-
ing—appealing to sinners and unbelievers to
laccept Christ through fear of hell. This,
| he thought, was the cheapest and easiest way
| of leading them to Christ. His life was not
| influenced much by fear of hell, he said, but
|rather by a desire to strive for a higher
| goal; just as the honor roll student at col-
|lege applies himself, not, from fear of fail-
}ing his work but from a desire to do as well
}as he can.

Appeals to the intellects or to the aesthetic
natures of a congregation constituted the
| second type. This type of sermon was used
|to please the congregation and make the
| minister popular, for people could enjoy it
without feeling any pangs of conscience or
‘undergoing a spiritual awakening. Preach-
ing of this kind is used a great deal in the
| North, especially in Unitarian churches, but
such preachers fall short of the great doc-
trines of Christianity, such as Paul preached
in his ministry. From the Bible we know of
only one intellectual sermon ever preached by
| Paul—the one on Mar’s Hill. And as far as
| we know, not one soul was brought to Christ
hy this sermon. So Paul went to preaching
the simple Gospel in a simple way that
reached the hearts of thousands.
| Paul later said to preach Christ and Him
crucified, That is what Dr. Lingle classed as
jthe third type of preaching—to preach
| Christ's ‘life on earth with men, His resur-
rection, His intercession at the Throne of
Grace—to hold up all that Christ was, all
that He taught, all His service to men, as
an example for us to follow. The minister
that preaches these truths, messages that
come from his own heart and life, will have
the most consecrated and spiritual congre-
gation.

The great work of the minister, Dr. Lingle
said in closing, is to comfort God’s people,
to open to them the source of comfort and
strength they need, and to build up their
spiritual lives.

Who Knows?

That porporal punishment was once re-
sorted to at Davidson College to enforce
discipline. A student from Salisbury and
one from Chester, S. C., were once vic-
tims, and the next morning all the stu-
dents from these two towns saddled the
horses on the college farm and rode sev-
eral miles toward their homes and left
the horses grazing by the roadside.

That in 1853 two students were definite-
ly suspended for starting a fight with
negroes. They had demanded of some of
the country servants that they remove
their hats, which they refused to do. The
hats were knocked off and that started a
free fight for all.

That in the spring of 1861 it was voted
to read the punctuality and honor roll at
commencement, a custom which has sur-
vived until now. Punctuality and moral
conduct were counted as one-fifth in
grading honors,

That burial expenses of deceased mem-
bers of Philanthropic,and, Eumenean Lit-
erary Societies were borne by the soci-
eties, and that appropriate headstones
were furnished by the society of which
he was a member. Some of these are seen
in the Davidson cemetery now. The halls
were draped in black for members who
died at college.

That the first prize recorded at David-
son was offered by the Latin professor in
1860 to that sophomore who was “best
skilled in the Latin tongue.”

That the law forbidding a student to
leave the campus during study hours
was not repealed until 1889, and it was
necessary to have permission to go to
the depot at train time until 1894.

That until 1889 the sexes divided on en-
tering chapel at commencement, sitting
on opposite sides of the hall during the
exercises. The students petitioned for
the revoking of this and their request
was granted with the understanding that
if the order should be unsatisfactory the
change would not be permanent.

That Maxwell Chambers day was first
celebrated in 1890 to do honor to David-
son’s benefactor. It was also that same
year in which the Senior oratorical con-
tests began.

That the ten men who preceded Pres-
ident Martin held office on an average
of seven years six months each.

That the date of the organization of
the Y. M. C. A. at Davidson is not defi-
nitely known.

That since 1902 the handbook has been
published annually by the Y. M. C. A.

That the first query chosen for debate
in Literary societies was Is slavery a
blessing or a curse? In 1837 subjects for
debate were stated in the form of a ques-
tion,

A novel means of cheating during re-
cent semester examinations was carried
out at West Virginia Wesleyan by a fair
co-ed, who inscribed certain useful for-
mulas on her ankle, underneath chiffon
hose.—Ring-Tum Phi,

An Exceptional Value!

It requires notechnical knowledge of automobiles to appre-
ciate the outstanding value of the Ford Touring Car.

Not only is it the lowest priced five-passenger car on the
market, but it is also a car that costs little to operate, little
to keep in condition and has an unusually high resale value
after years of service.
