YMCA Revenue

Running Short |

“Students have not been
as receptive as could have
been hoped,’’ saidy “Lester
Strong of this year's YMCA
fund drive. Strong is vice
president of the YMCA and

head of the drive.

This “year’s goal was
$3,500. About $2.50 per per-
son is collected each year,
but Strong does not feel it
is unreasonable for each stu-
dent to contribute $4.00. The
drive was held on Sept. 29

* and 30.

The faculty and admin-
istration has in the past
fiven strongly to the drive
according to Strong. .‘How-
ever, the North Mecklen-
burg YMCA fund drive and
the United. Appeal are cur-
rently underway, and _ the
contributions this year may
be smaller.

Consequently, the drive
has» depended more this
year on student support. The
Davidson College YMCA is
supported entirely by funds
raised at this time.

What we have here is a
documentary of the begin-
ning of the end of the Great
American Nation.

The central thesis is that
old class distinctions based
on economics are being re-
placed by division based on
the polarity between capita-
lists and the emerging youth
drug culture.

Radical post-Marxian so-
ciology is thus the subject,
and | think in this situation
we have the makings of the
great American epic.

Faulker thought the Amce-
rican saga was the Civil
War and subsequent desola-
tion of the South. A.B. Gu-
thrie found it in the rape of
the Indian nation.

But I think the definitive
American experience is to be
plucked from the scenery in
which men like the charact-

The YMICA fund drive has
been highly successful in
past years, but has suffered
this year from competition
with other YMCA. fund
drives. All financing for col-
lege YMOA projects will de-

drive.

to make sure that no_stu-

ers in ‘Joe’ live.

The hero, Joe, is a mythi
cal figure: the quintessen-
tial Middle American, — in
Richard Nixon's sense of ‘the
term and also Norman Mail- ~
er’s. His problems are those
of the nation, and his actions
reflect the innermost, secret
horrible social program - of
our nation’s “leaders.”

Well, ‘“‘Joe"’’ explores the
political and psychological
union of the American work
ing man with his political
and economic bosses,

The union is based on
their common hate for the
youth drug cult, which they
see as a privileged class
having all the fun without
suffering the scurge of law
and moral custom.

The plot: advertising exe-
cutive William Compion, in
a fit of rage, kills a junkie
who has been living with
his daughter and has. sent
her on a bum trip. In a bar
later that day he inadver-
tently gives himself away to
a blue-collar worker, Joe,

“who surprisingly does not
“use the knowledge for black-

mail, but instead openly ad-
mires Compton for this con
summate act: of . political
bravery.

In fact, Joe is eager to
fraternize with Compton,
he dreams of going around
killing hippies and blacks,
if an excuse could be found.

I refuse to recount any
plot details. It is too power-
ful. See it for yourself,

The movie's power de-
rives from careful charac-
ter studies of Joe and Comp-
ton. We are made to feel
that Joe, the hard hat mo
ral monsier of Spiro Agnew's
dreams, lives and walks
among us. He is America
personified.

Moreover, Joe’s leaders—
Compton, Nixon, Agnew—
are of one spirit with: him—
in bloodlust, sexual prever-
sion and_ selfishness. The
outward respectability which
demarks them into ‘‘sepa-
rate’ classes is dissolved by
the powerful hate which
they share.

Peter Boyle's performance
as ,Joé€ is the central
strength of the movie. Beer
gutted and lumpy-muscular,
Joe is the. archtypical work
er whose drive “to express
his own standards and mas-
culine” pride has been re-

routed into perverse — and
murderous channels.
The  care-worn face of

Compton reveals a tortured
spirit which can only be
soothed for a time by the
pleasure of discovering his
own bloodlust.

Who is saved?

The main thrust of the

,_ movie is toward analysis of

the union of worker and the
ruling class, but this fusion

is catalyzed by the new hip-

pie cult. :

diences as being one notch

the youth drug cult.

In a two-hour movie there
is no time left to explore
the drug cult too, but some

of “the glaring errors of
“Easy Rider’ have been
avoided,

their fixes, pure and simple.
I think this is a_ realistic
portrayal,

Neither is there an at

| do not mean the ‘‘crime’’
of possession and use, |

murderous as the last. reel
of ‘‘Joe’’ when the capital-
ists run shotgun wild.

I call ‘‘Joe’’ an ‘honest
movie, “serious jin its intent
to artfully recreate the radi-
cal’s social analysis of
America. It is not yet a
personal work, except as it
delineates Joe.
