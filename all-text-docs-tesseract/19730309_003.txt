Cartography Scholar Presents

British Museum Map Treasures

By MARK DEATON
Asst. Managing Editor

Helen Wallis, superintendent
of the Map Room and deputy
keeper of the British Museum,
presented an illustrated lecture
on the history of the British
Museum, highlighting some of
its most interesting treasures,
in the Philanthropic Hall Wed-
nesday evening.

Wallis, one of Britain's most
distinguished scholars in the
fields of historical cartography
and the history of exploration
and discovery, is presently
visiting Dr. and Mrs. W. P.
Cumming.

She spoke at Davidson after
a lecturing tour of the west
coast of Canada and the
United States and before
visiting the Library of Congress
and speaking in Williamsburg,
Va.

“I was always interested in
geography and history,”’ said
Wallis. ‘I chose a field com-
bining the two."

She came into contact with
the British Museum while
writing her doctoral thesis on
“The Exploration of the
Pacific.”’ After receiving her D.
Phil. from Oxford University,
she began work at the museum.
As superintendent of the Map
Room, she now refers to herself
as a ‘Museum Piece."

Wallis explained that car-
tography serves both the arts
and the sciences.

“The technical side of maps is
a scientifically studied field,”
Wallis explained. “Sometimes a
map is the main means of scien-
tific advance.

“Another aspect of mapping
is more in the line of serving the
humanities,’ she said. “Many

|_wea~

maps, of course, show cultural
landscapes.

“Another side of car-
tography, especially in early
maps, lies in the consideration
of maps as works of art. Many
artists occupied in doing fine
paintings were also engraving
beautiful maps," she indicated.

“A well produced modern
map is considered a work of art
in its own way,” Wallis ex-
plained.

She cited relatively new
methods of mapping such as
ultimated mapping, computer
mapping, and mapping from
satellites as being responsible
for very fine productions.

‘These days, one doesn't look
for the same kind of antiquity in
maps;"’ said Wallis. ‘It would
surprise people today if we put
cherubs around a map title.

“Of course all maps don't
need to be literally accurate.
For example, there is a certain
London underground map
which is not artistic, but is very
effective. While the directions
and distances are not accurate,
all relationships are true, she
explained.

Wallis, who serves as the first
woman president of the British
Cartographic Society, cited
several of the most interesting
treasures of the British
Museum.

She mentioned a map in the
King George collection marking
the boundary between the then
new United States and the
British territory.

“This map was used in 1782,
in the Conference in Paris,”
Wallis indicated. ‘It is a
fascinating map as a part of
political history."

Wallis expressed particular
enjoyment in setting up
exhibitions. She cited an
exhibition celebrating the bicen-
tenial of Captain Cook in 1968,
and an_ exhibition com-
memorating the 1473 birth of
Copernicus.

Wallis explained that the
oldest map in the British
Museum was a_ Babylonian
tablet showing the world and
cosmos dated 500 B.C.

Wallis also mentioned Egyp-
tian views of the fields of the
dead.

“These show what Egyptians
thought of life to come, and
while not themselves maps,
they fall into the same
category."’ Wallis explained.

The researchers. headed by a
husband-wife team from Har-
vard University, are in the area
to study the effects of the
pecuhar Haitian family struc-
ture on the death rate of infants
and small children

Common in Haiti today is a
marriage arrangement known
as the placage marriage.
Gregory explained that this is
very similar to the common-law
marriages found in the United
States, only they appear to be
much more transient.

The unusual feature of the
placage marriage is the man-
ner in which involved children
are dealt with once the relation-
ship is broken, as most
inevitably are.

When a placage family
breaks apart in Haiti, the sons
are required to go with the
father, who usually returns to
his home village. The daughters
are then left in the care of the
mother. However, if the mother
later wishes to remarry, the
daughters are then left with
another relative, usually a
grandparent.

According to Gregory, this

In an unusually |

resulted
high number of
displaced children in the im
mediate vicinity of the Schweit
zer Hospital due to its) work
in medical and hygiene
education, which have
drastically reduced the mor-
tality rate of newborn babies

“The interesting thing is that
despite the increased survival
of the newborn in the area
around the hospital, the mor-
tality rate of children under five
is nearly 50 percent,’ Gregory
said.

“What the study is really
looking for then, is a picture of
the effects of the widespread
displacement of children on
their availability for medical
care and treatment.”

Related to this, the project is
studying the migration patterns
of young males, most of whom
leave their home village for
marriage but often return, with
or without wives, by their mid-
twenties.

Gregory will be involved en-
tirely with the compilation of
data as reported by native
Haitian workers who do all of
the actual field work.
