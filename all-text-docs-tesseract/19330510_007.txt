WILDCAT TRACKMEN
LOSE TO DUKE FOR FIRST
DEFEAT OF SEASON

THE SPORTS PARADE

‘CAT NINE BREAKS
HAMPDEN-SYDNEY’S
WINNING STREAK

RA CASKIE NORVELL 32.

Ole Man Jupe Pluvius again inter-
fered with the Davidson-Wake Forest
imbroglio. It looks as if the game will
have to be definitely set aside, and only
‘one contest, that in the Deacons’ back-
yard, will be played between the two
Big Five favorites. The game will have
a decided bearing on the championship.
Junie Barnes will undoubtedly be the
D hurling choice, and either Charlie
Harris or Lefty Pearce should get the
call to fling them over for Coach Laird’s
boys.

The nine got into a hotbed of trouble
when they tried to spank V. P. I.’s Gobblers.
Jule West held the Techmen to four bingles
in the second encounter, while his mates
were garnering six, but even so the Virginia
team came out on top, 4 to 1.

Hampden-Sydney’s string of eight con-
secutive victories was definitely nipped
in the bud when the ’Cats won an over-
time thriller in Death Valley, 3 to 2.

Feeble play ‘in the field, and poor base
running served to completely rout the fresh-
man nine on its eastern invasion last week.
Louisburg, Carolina, and State were met on
the trip, and the co-eds at the first men-
tioned school proved very popular with the
freshman aggregation. Take a tip from ye
ed, it was a swell place.

Davidson's track team met their initial
defeat, losing to the strong Duke team.
Cochran, with an injury, tied his college
record in the shotput to win this event.

Johnny Brownlee, Blue Devil flash, took
first in the furlong and the low hurdles,
beating Fleagle, Davidson speedster, in the
former. The Devils swept the 800-yard run,
and the ’Cats finished one, two, three in the
high hurdles, McCallie, McPhail, and Pratt
finishing in the order named.

Carolina upset the dope, and defeated
the illustrious Peck Luck, to bump the
Cavaliers in their annual diamond classic
in Greensboro last Saturday. The Tar
Heels hit their stride, and got on the
formidable slow ball artist to rout Vir-
ginia 11 to 1 in a leading upset of the
past week.

The Davidson diamondmen leave this week
to take on Duke and Wake Forest. The
Deacons’ record is known to all students,
and Duke has just returned from a most
successful northern invasion, numbering
Princeton, Fordham, and Manhattan among
its victims. These games will go a long
ways toward determining the state cham-
pionship.

Fraternity baseball is progressing, with
the Pikas already in the finals of the
upper bracket, and the Phi Delts, Kappa
Sigs, and the Phi Gams still in the race
in the lower division. According to ad-
vance dope, and the predictions of some
of Davidson’s leading amateur prognosti-
cators, the Kappa Sigma nine will be the
team to oppose the Pi K. A. boys for the
title. However, the Phi Gams and the
Phi Delts may have something to say
about this.

The golfers hit the road this week, minus
the services of the long-driving Jack Wag-
ner, and Johnny Thompson. Bob Gregory
and Tom Bowles have been added to the
team to replace these men who are unable
to compete further because of an over-
abundance of cuts. Emory, Georgia Tech,
Clemson, and Furman will be met on this
southern trip.

The tennis team meets Wake Forest
here in their only engagement for the
coming week. The team has been ma-
terially strengthened by the return of

Gobblers Tale Brace
Of Ball Games From
Davidson Aggregation

V. P. I.’s Sluggers Whip Into Action
to Lick Wildcats Twice, 7-0
and 4-1

Davidson's varsity baseball team suffered
two straight defeats at the hands of a strong
V. P. I. aggregation on May 3 and 4, the
scores being 7-0 and 4-1. The games were
played on the Gobblers’ diamond at Blacks-
burg, Va.

In the first encounter, V. P. I. played air-
tight ball, being led on the mound by Suth-
erland, who allowed the Wildcats only three
scattered hits.

The Techmen hit well to secure nine bin-
gles off Baily, Davidson southpaw, including
triples by Cottle and Casey, and circuit swats
by Downing and Morgan. Batting honors
went to Downing, who had two hits out
of three trips to the plate.

It was Davidson's turn to hit well in the
second contest, and the ’Cats secured six
bingles to V. P. I’s four. However, the
Techmen bunched their hits in the pinches
to win.

The lone run for the Wildcats came in the
eighth inning, while the Gobblers’ tallied
two in the third, and onein’the fourth and
seventh innings. West pitched the entire
game for Davidson, while Mitchell went the
route for the V. P. I. nine.

Over ’Kittens

Davidson's freshman nine returned Satur-
day night’ from a disastrous eastern inva-
sion, on which they met defeat at the hands
of Louisburg College, and freshman teams
from North Carolina and N. C. State., A
game with Wake Forest, scheduled for Fri-
day, was rained out.

Louisburg 8; Davidson 4

Burgess, Louisburg left fielder, slugged out
a homer with all aboard in the initial canto
to rout the Wildkittens in their first en-
counter of an eastern road trip, by a score
of 8 to 4. George Cathey was on the mound
for the freshmen and allowed eight bingles.

Although outhit by the Davidson fresh-

at Chapel Hill last Thursday.

Jack Jenkins pitched for Davidson, and
allowed seven hits, while his mates garnered
ten. Partridge, with three for—five;-led-the
hitting. Irwin, Carolina shortstop, starred
afield, making eight..putouts.

Davidson made two runs in the second

fell short as Glasgow eased three fast ones
by Burns for the final out.

Climaxing their tour at Raleigh, the fresh-
man nine again went down in defeat, losing
to the Wolflets of N. C. State, 6 to 1. Free-
man, State southpaw, turned the ’Kittens
back with three scattered hits, two singles
by Burns and a home run by Moore, which
was Davidson's only counter.

Poor fielding and shoddy base running
were largely responsible for the margin of
Davidson's defeat. Womble of State hit three
circuit clouts in four trips to the plate.

First Defeat for Virginians in Eight
Starts Dealt by Locals

Invading Hampden-Sydney'’s formidable
“Death Valley,” the Davidson nine, behind
airtight pitching of its little southpaw,
Charlie Pearce, licked the Tigers, 3 to 2, in
a twelve-inning fracas on May 2.

The overtime contest was a slab duel be-
tween Mann and Pearce, with the latter com-
ing out on top, although he gave up seven
bingles to Mann’s six. The victory of Da-
vidson brought to an end a winning streak
of eight contests for Hampden-Sydney.

Pearce, besides pitching a whale of a
game, also led his team at bat, getting two
hits out of five trips to the plate. Mock,
Peabody, and the Morrison brothers count-
ed for Davidson’s other safeties. Humphries,
Hampden-Sydney shortstop, led his team’s

‘Jattack with the willow, getting two for five.
