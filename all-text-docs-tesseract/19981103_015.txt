Mission accomplished: men’s cross country make

By Kerru Gorpon
Staff Writer

The 1998 version of the men’s
cross-country team knew it had wit-
nessed an incredible season when it
stepped on the line of the Southern
Conference Championships this past
Saturday, evident in a number of per-
sonal records, unprecedented team fin-
ishes, and a new school record set thus
far. But the nine harriers also knew that
would mean nothing without a strong
performance against the league’s best.
Entering the season as the No. 8 pre-
season pick, the men accepted the chal-
lenge despite many letdowns and dis-
appointments in years past—only to
come through with the greatest perfor-
mance in the history of Davidson men’s

cross country.

Led again by the incredible legs of
junior Brent Ferrell, the men finished
fifth at the 1998 Southern Conference
meet, with last year’s eighth-place fin-
ish as (not-yet-forgotten-but-now-dis-
tant) a memory in the minds of the
runners. The men scored 126 points,
narrowly beating the Furman men by a
single point to secure the defeat of seven
scholarship teams, UT-Chattanooga,

.taking six of the top 10 (and AIll-

Conference) places, easily won the title,
running away with 24 points. East Ten-
nessee State, still feared as a power-
house despite their uncharacteristic sea-
son, finished a surprising second with
45 points, with their top 5 all finishing
among the first 15 competitors. Appa-
lachian State, last year’s champion, was

third (99 points) while Western Caro-
lina finished in fourth (108 points).

In lieu of the temperature at race
time (81 degrees and very humid) and
the challenging home course, Ferrell
finished in 17th place with a time of
26:49 over the 8K hilly course. He
proved yet again why he is the best
Davidson College male XC runnerever,-
leading the team for.the sixth straight
time this season and guiding them to
their record-breaking performance. Jun-
ior William Isenhour continued his late
season tear, following Ferrell in 22nd
place in a time of 27:08. No doubt
Isenhour’s ability to regain the form
evident in his freshman year helped the
men the past few meets, including his
performance Saturday, Senior Josh
Cookson once again supported the team

Although the Wildcats would have
liked to have ended their season with a
win, their loss last Thursday to UNC
Ashville (10-5-1) was a great warmup
for the kind of competition they will
face in the upcoming Southern Confer-
ence Tournament which starts this Tues-
day night at 7pm at home against Sth
seeded Wofford College. In their last

regular
Wildcats 1|season
UNC Asheville 2| game the
‘Cats fell
to a solid

UNC Ashville team by a close 2 to I
margin.

When junior Ginny Dye scored
her seventh goal of the season 10 min-
utes into the game, it appeared as if the
‘Cats might be headed for a victory.

Dye, the Wildcats leading scorer, net-
ted the goal off an assist by fellow
junior Kate McKnight. Overall,
Davidson played an outstanding first
half, forcing the UNCA goal keeper to
make five tough saves while the solid
play of the defense prevented Wildcat
keeper, sophomore Winnie Corrigan,
from having to make a single save. The
‘Cats headed into the second period
with a 1-0 lead.

Davidson continued their solid
play in the second half and held their
opponent scoreless for over 15 minutes.
However, at the 61:52 mark, Amanda
Wilkinson of UNCA tied the game.
Neither team was able to score for the
remainder of regulation and the game
headed ‘into overtime tied at one. In
overtime, the ‘Cats fought hard, but
three minutes into the extra session
UNCA scored off a long shot. UNCA
won the game 2 to 1.

Despite the loss, the Lady Wild-

After the dust had settled on the
trails behind Baker Sports Complex
Saturday morning, only one question
remained for the Lady Wildcats. Had
they, in fact, finally outraced Furman,
earning a 4th place finish in the South-
ern Conference Cross-County Champi-
onships? Had they accomplished a goal

in strong fashion, running 27:21 and
placing 25th. Junior Pat Burchett out-
sprinted two Furman runners to finish
in 31st with a time of 27:34, providing
the team with the necessary places to
escape with a victory over the Palladins.
Junior Thomas McElveen rounded out
the top 5 in 27:55, finishing in 35th.

Nic Crider of UT-Chattanooga was
the individual champion, running an
eyeopening 25:24 to claim his third
straight title. This feat is surely evident
of his prowess in the conference, and
lends support to his chances of qualify-
ing forthe NCAA Championships later
this month.

Freshman Dan Gibson and Senior
Keith Gordon ran 28:09 (39th) and 28:53
(Sist) respectively for the Wildcats.
Gibson closes out his season as the best

recruit in head coach Gad Andrew’s
tenure since the arrival of Cookson in
1994. Junior Scott Hutchins ran 29:16
to place 61st, while senior Davey Ba-
con ended his career as a Davidson
harrier in 29:48, placing 72nd to round
out the team’s competitors.

The men close out the season at the
NCAA District If] Championships No-
vember 14 at Furman University in
Greenville, SC. This meet acts as the
district’ s qualifying meet for the NCAA
Championships, covering 10K as the
distance. Many of the mid-South’s best
teams will be present, including repre-
sentatives of the ACC, SEC, and South-
ern confererices. The men look to end
their incredible season on a high note
and complete the foundation that has
been laid for future teams.

Appalachian State, and Western Caro-
lina, This finish is by far the best
Conference result in the program’ s his-
tory. In fact, the previous best perfor- ~
mance for the Wildcats was in 1992,
when Davidson placed Sth out of 8
schools.

Perhaps the winning recipe for the
team this year has been the combination
of senior experience and young talent,
and a passion for racing highlighted by
individual efforts Saturday. Wildcat
frontrunner sophomore Smyth Bitter
ran another incredible race, finishing
14th overall with time of 19:41 for the
5K. Freshwoman Lucy Billingsly im-

‘proved 50. seconds on this course and

ran an impressive 20:11, finishing 2nd
for the Wildcats and 23rd overall, earn-
ing Athlete of the Week in the process.
Senior Suzy Burr, freshwoman Caroline
Little, and sophomore Clare Frey epito-
mized team cooperation, motivating
each other during the final mile to finish
25th, 29th, and 32nd respectively. Fol-
lowing Frey were sophomores Jill
Neumayer, seniors Beth Brewster,
Jenny Klotz, and Kelly Kiefer for
Davidson. In cross-country, the top 5
runners’ places are added for the team
score, and Davidson ended with 113
points with an impressive top 5 split of
48 seconds.

Commenting on Saturday’s achieve-
ments, Coach Thomas Cason said, “In
August at pre-season, our team mission
began as we set out to become a
top 4 team in this conference. Saturday
was magical. All the miles and hard
work finally paid off. It was an awe-
some team effort. Together everyone
achieves more, and this team is living
proof of that!”

With spirits still high, the team will
continue training these next 2 weeks for
the Southeast Regional Championships
at Furman University. Words have
already been exchanged as Davidson
aims to repeat and even improve on
Saturday’s performance, and perhaps
rewrite mage once again. i
