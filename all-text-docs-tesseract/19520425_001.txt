formed service fraternity, will
operate a used book store for the

Explain Symbols
In College Church

As the College Church nears completion and the public gets
a peek at its interior, questions have been raised over the sym-
bolism of the chancel furniture used in the edifice. Explanations
were made by Dr. Cunningham this week.

The divided chancel consists of
the pulpit and lectern, the latter
being the rostrum from which the
Scripture is read. Symbols and
meanings on the pulpit include:
Wheat, Bread of Life; Lily, Purity
and Innocence; Olive Branch,
Peace; Vine, Our Savior; Lyre,
Sacred Music; and the Torch, Na-
tivity of our Lord. |

The Lectern contains three sym-
bols—the Messanic Rose, Love;
Butterfly, Resurrection; and Palms,
Victorious Christian's reward in
afterlife.

The Descending Dove on the
communion table signifies the Holy

Spirit.

The Font is adorned with the
Eagle, St. Johm; the Scallop Sheil,
Holy Baptism; Descending Dove,
the Holy Spirit, and the Five-
pointed Star, Epiphany.

Contractors Thompson and Street
have requested that the church be
visited only during working hours,
as it must be closed in the work-
men’s absence.

Costing close to $800,000 at
present, the newest campus struc-
ture is scheduled for dedication
at the baccalaureate sermon of June
2. .

Mac Bulgin’s Vereen Bell prize-winning story ‘“The Latin
Scholar,” will be published as a featured article in the forth-
coming Scripts ‘n Pranks. The award, announced Thursday.
brings Bulgin a $50 cash stipulation.

The Vereen Bell contest gives
this honor each year to the author
of the outstanding peace of crea-
tive writing in memory of Vereen
M. Bell who was graduated from
Davidson in '32. He became a high-
ly successful novelist before losing
his tife while a naval lieutenant in
the Second Battle of the Philippine
sea (1944),

Dr. James Southall Wilson made
the official presentation, having
served as final judge in the contest.

In making the presentation
he took a moment to speak on
the fact thar this award
furnishes “a great opportunity
both for the remembrance of
an eminent writer and for the
reward to a promising literary
mind. It is a living monument
sather than one of stone or
marble.”

When contacted after the award
had been presented, Bulgin stated
that he was “very surprised” and
smilingly commented that the idea
for his MS had originally come to
him while he was being forced to
work in a corn field. (The story
itself involves a young man work-
ing in a patch of corn.)

He had been thinking it over for
four or five months before com-
pleting his final draft.

Dr. Wilson said that “The

Pi Kapps Vote In
Chapter Leaders

Pj Kappa Phi Fraternity elected
officers for the first semester of
the coming year. They are as fol-
lows: Jesse Fisher, archon (presi-
dent); Don Baucom, treasurer;
Jinks Jervey, secretary; Charlie
Murray, historian; Winston Wright,
chaplain; Chuck Babcock, warden;
Mitchell Patton, rushing chairman;
Clark Remsburg, alumni secretary;
Lawrence Erwin, Interfraternity
Council representative and Bob
Southwell, cuss-out reader.

Le Circle Picks
New Officers At
Formal Meeting

Le Cercle Francais has elected
Mac Bulgin as president for the
coming year. Norman Johnson will
serve as the new vice president,
and Moody Smith will take over
as secretary. Dr. Goldiere will con-
tinue to be the treasurer of the
group.

The mesting which was held
in the home of Dr. Goldiere,
was presided over by the out-
going president, Jack Hunter.
The past vice-president, Mac
Buigin, had charge of the pro-
gtam which included two read-
ings by Bob Crutchfield and
Norman Johnson, and two
chort skits.

In the first skit “Le Mari Dis-
teait,” Stuart Shippey and Alden
Williams were the actors, while
participating in the second “Un Peu
Exaggere” were Fred Alexander,
Moody Smith, Ashley Hayward,
Buddy Lamon, Hal Davis, Holmes
Rolston, and Norman Johnson.

Refreshments were served by
Mrs. Watts and Mes. Goldierc
after the meeting.

For its last meeting of the year,
the Cercle will meet at Chez Mon-
tet on April 29. There the members
will be served a typical French
dinner.

Latin Scholar,” which is the
tragedy of an individual swept
away in the flowing tide of his
environment, succeeded in its
intentions, in that it “gives a
sense of frustration that still
has satisfaction of ite own in-
spiration.”

Dr.’ Witson stated that there were
five very excellent papers in the
final judging. A play by Dick Per-
kins, he said, “showed great skill
in dialogue. I feel that if Mr. Per-
kins keeps on writing, especially
in the field of drama, he may
someday be a success.”

Dr. Wilson said he believes that
young men’s writings so often are
unconscious repetition of what they
have read. Successful writing comes
when one can get himself into the
work and can develop a technique
of easily expressing himelf.

Davidsonian Gets
Honor Mention

On Safety Edition

Honorable mention for editorial
excellence in the 1951 College
Newspaper Contest on Safe Driving
has been awarded The Davidsonian,
it was announced this week -by
James S. Kemper, chairman of the
contest, sponsored by the Lumber-
men’s Mutual Casualty Company.

The editorials—“Dear Governor:
This One’s Been Forgotten,” and
“Highway 21 Continues Its Toll
Awaiting Overdue Repairs’—pub-
lished in the December 14 issue,
were to direct the attention of
Governor Kerr Scott’s road-build-
ing and repairing regime to the de-
plorable state of U. S. 21 between
Charlotte and Davidson.

The issue also carried a six-
photograph layout of hazardous
conditions on the highway, an in-
formative feature on the accident
total on the road, and a safety car-
toon by Don Mahy.

Winner of the over-all safety
effort by the paper for non-daililes
was The Transcript, Ohio Wes-
leyan. Of fifteen honorable men-
tion awards, The Davidsonian
placed sixth. Last year the paper
finished in second place among non-
dailies, winning a prize of $250.

ULES Is Planning
Bonus Film Night
With New Movies

The United Literary Film Society
will present a bonus program at
7:30 on Friday night, May 2. A
series of outstanding documentary
‘films are scheduled to be shown, in-
cluding the prize-winning “Rive”
of Pere Lorentz.

This film, made in 1937, was one
of the first short informative movies
to demonstrate that skillful direct-
ing and camera works can make a
documentary as dramatic and ex-
pressive as the costliest riollywood
product.

The success of well-made
films like “The River,’ soon
led to the adoption of the pop-
ular semi-documentary techni-
que in Hollywood.

“River” dramatizes
moods of the mighty Mississippi
and brings to life the social prob-
lems it creates as well as the many
valuable tasks it performs. A spe-
cial score has been composed for
the film by Virgil Thompson.

The program also includes a
March of Time film entitled
“The New South.” It depicts
the rapidly changing social
scene of the South brought
about after the Civil War and
in the first half of the twentieth
century.

Two special films on Sweden
will be shown: “Darlane Heart of
Sweden,” and “Life in Stockholm.”
The first depicts costumes, customs
and handicrafts in one of Sweden's
most colorful provinces.

The second affords an intimate
glimpse into the capital of “The
Well-Stocked Cellar.”

Showing these documentary and
news films will be the last activity
of ULFS this school year. The
joint literary society committee was
headed by Stuart Shippey.

Masquers Hard Labor Produces Biggest Theatrical
Operation Ever Presented By Davidson College Group

When the curtain rises tonight
on the Red and Black Masquers’
Fine Arts Week Production of
“Macbeth,” many hours of labor
will be culminated in the biggest
production ever undertaken by a
Davidson dramatic group.

The play, which has been in re-
hearsal since late March, features
a cast of over 20 and requires a
great many scene and lighting
changes.

Heading the cast in the title role
of “Macbeth” is Dick Perkins who
last year appeared as Brutus in
“Julius Caesar.” Dick is a junior
and before coming to Davidson
served in the army with a special
services unit at Fort Jackson where
he did sports announcing for the
post radio station.

Dick is president of his social
featernity Alpha Tau Omega,
a member of the football team
and vice president of Alpha Psi

Omega national honorary dra-

matic fraternity.

Playing opposite Dick as Lady
Macbeth is Mrs. Mary Lou Daggy
who is making her first appearance
on the Davidson stage although
she has appeared in numerous col-
lege and little theatre productions,
Mrs. Daggy has taken over Mrs.
Holly's post as Dean Bailey’s sec-
retary and this along with her
family really keeps her busy.

Bob Crutchfield makes a return
appearance on the Davidson stage
to play the part of Maicom, the
eldest son of King Duncan. Bob
last year appeared in“Julius Caesar”
and since then has confined his
dramatic work to doing make-up.

Howard Proctor continues his
busy dramatic life as he plays

the role of Duncan, the ill-

fated King of Scotland.

Howard has appeared in all

three productions this year and

just last week did a skit in
the D-Club Foolies. Bill Phifer
plays the king's other son Don-
albain and also appears in the
final scenes as Young Siward.
Vance Mizelle returns to create
the role of the Lord Ross and does
his usual fine job. Vance makes
this his fourth role this year, a
record also held by Tad Currie
who plays Macduff. Both Vance
and Tad are officers in the Mas-
quers and Alpha Psi Omega.
George Walker makes his David-
son debut as the faithful Banquo
and has been doing an A-1 job. Bill
Gordon also makes his debut as
the Lord Lennox. Mac Doubles
and Sandy McGeachy portray the
murderers as well as several other
minor roles.

Mrs. Martha Lee Hull re-
turns to the stage after her
tole in Ten Little Indians to
play the part of Lady Mac-

duff and Bob Mims plays her

son. Betty Bradley and Bob

Dunbar play the Gentlewoman

and the Doctor in the famous

sleepwalking scene.

Others in the cast include Luther
Yaun, Tom Dove and Dick Wil-
liams as the witches; Vereen Bell,
Paul Alexander, Martin McGirt and
Frank Renfro as messengers.

The play is being directed by
Prof. Raymond W. Tyson of the
Speech Department. Before com-
ing to Davidson Prof. Tyson
taught at Columbia University and
did radio work in New York. He
has also been connected with the

Cleveland Playhouse and played:

Shakespeare with the Globe Thea-
tre.

Heading the stage crew is
Tad Currie who is once again
acting as assistant director and
technical director. Tad designed
