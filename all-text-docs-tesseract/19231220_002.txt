CAT GRID RECORD

In the Thanksgiving Football Ex-
tra, The Davidsonian printed the Da-
vidson football record from 1897, when
Davidson played her first intercol-
legiate game, to the present time.

Owing to ill-kept records, breaks
occurred in the list, in the years 1903,
1905, 1912, and 1913. An appeal was
made to alumni for correct scores and
for corrections which might be neces-
sary in other years.

The Davidsonian wishes to thank
Mr. James C. Harper, of Lenoir, N.
C., for the scores of the following
games:

Oct. 18, 1912, at Davidson, D. C.,
125; Mt. Pleasant, 0.

Oct. 18, 1913, at Raleigh, D. C., 6;
N.C. State, 26.

Any other information which alumni
can give in regard to the missing
games, or any corrections in the scores
as tabulated, will be greatly appreci-
ated. Please address all communica-
tions to C. M. S. McIlwaine, Box 263,
Davidson, N,. C.

Johnny Bachman Lowers
College Course Record

Negotiates Nine-Hole Course in 33,
Two Strokes Under Former
Record

On the afternoon of Saturday, the 8th,
Johnny Bachman established a new
record for the Davidson golf course.
His score. of 33 broke all previous
records for the course and showed that
Davidson has a real golfer in Johnny.
Throughout the afternoon his play was
featured by strong drives and accurate
putts.

In only one case did he let his mighty
drive run wild and that was in driving
from the seventh to the eighth green,
when the little white ball went far be-
yond the green and across the road.
Only those acquainted with the course
can appreciate what it takes to make
such a drive. The best play of the af-
ternoon was made at the fifth hole. Af-
ter a long drive and a 150-yard mashie
shot the ball was on the green. With
one putt the ball was sunk. Hard luck
follows the best of players, for Johnny
missed a 32 score by rimming the cup
on a 3-foot putt at the last hole.

The previous record of the Davidson
course was 35, which was established
by Woodrow Clark, ’18 Johnny has
tied that record three times and broken
it once with his late 33.

Last year Johnny was made captain
of the golf team and because of his
ability he retains that position this year.
Not only has he won distinction on the
campus but also in the circle of cham-
pionships as he was low medalist in the
| Georgia State Tournament last year. To
jadd to his list of laurels he has won
several loving cups at his country club.

Last summer Johnny was engaged in

Now that the football season is over,
the public eyes is on the other sports
that have to do with the colder days.
Among these other sports is one that
the ancient Greeks indulged in during
the days of old, namely, wrestling. This
is a comparatively new sport at David-
son, but last year the team came out as
well as could be expected, and with all
of last year's team, with the exception of
two, back, a victorious team is expected
to be turned out,

Captain Weems, once the captain of
the West Point team, is planning to have |
an elimination contest as soon as every
one returns from the Christmas holi- |
This contest was to be had be-
fore the holidays but the fact that most
of the men were not iti a good enough |
physical condition, warranted the put- |
ting off of the bout. With a month to
get. in condition after they come back
and before the first mect, it will take |
hard training on the part of the grap-|
plers to get in shape but it can be done
succesfully, without danger of
training.

The letter men back this year are, |
Lindamood, captain; Selser,
and Cromartie, last year’s captain.
addition to these men are two
men, White and from last
year’s team, who are showing up well. |
There are several men going out for)
each position and there will be some}
strong competition going on for each |
weight especially the lighter weights.

practice is moving
The number of men who
came at Coach Rawson’s call exceeded
the maximum number hoped for. The
material is exceptionally good, there be-
ing an abundance of players for each
position except forward. 4

Now, there are two practices a day,
in the afternoon and the other at
night. This was made necessary on ac-

one

, count of the large number of men trying

for the team, The number is divided in-
to two squads, there being about 20 in

'each squad,

The practice for the first ten days
was drill in the foundamentals of bas-
ketball, close shooting, passing, pivot-
ing, reversing, longshooting, etc. Thurs-
day, Friday and Saturday of last weck,
the practice has consisted of scrimmage.
Defensive material is plentiful, but of-
fensive material is scarce.

In the Fresh squad there are six for-
mer high school basketball captains.
R. E. Faucette, Bristol, Va.;
Hewlitt, Wilmington, N. C.; C. G.

They are

The squad will be cut immediately af-

IN FAVOR
THIS FALL

Short,threebutton,
half-belted ulsters
are to be greatly
favored this fall.
You’ll see many
of them; but none
-like the Society
Brand Hampton.

The difference is in
the cut. There’s an air
about this overcoat that
you will find nowhere
else; it’s smartly cut;
every detail—the roll of
the lapel, the spacing of
the buttons, the placing
of the pockets-isexactly
right.
