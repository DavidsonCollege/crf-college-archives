nied it permission for the dis-
cussion to be held on campus
this past Tuesday.

“The session of the church
voted to deny permission be-
cause of an apprehension lest
the church was being used as
a sounding board for prepa-
ganda,” Dr. Sam Newell, pas-
tor, explained. As a part of
the church, WF activities are
under the jurisdiction of the

session.

The discussion had been
originally set for Wednesday,
March 9. A heavy snow forced
cancellation that afternoon.
The program was then sche-
duled for last Tuesday. On
both occasions the WF re-
quested permission from the
session.. However, it did not
meet between the request and
the first scheduled program.

“In both instances, Dr. Newell
had given us permission and
any action by the.session was
considered routine,” Shue com-
mented. “He gave permission,
feeling there was a precedent.”

On numerous occasions in
the past joint meetings have
been held with other racial
groups, “! cannot recall any

church body from other stu

“It is a pretty basic question
of whether the Christian church
is going to try to handle hot
social, economic and political
questions, or whether it will
draw a line between the secular
and sacred and leave those in-
terested in the secular to figure
out their own answers,” voiced
Shue.

Dr. Marrotte called the meet-
ing to order at 8:00, and Dr.
John Snell, German history
scholar from Tulane University,
gave the first presentation. Dr.
Snell, who also served as mod-
erator for the panel, represent:

He stated, “We cannot com-

Snell recommended that
there be two goals, or theses,
for U.S. policy in Germany, and

that the United States should
try to balance on the knife-edge
between respecting the Soviet
defensive position and guarding
against communist aggression.

The second speaker was Dr.
Clifford Foust of the University
of North Carolina, who is a stu-
dent of Imperial Russia and
Asian affairs. Dr. Foust defend-
ed the Soviet position on the
three major issues.

He first pointed up Soviet
power and growth, and assert-
ed that the sim of the
U.S.S_R. was to achieve peace
and friendship.

Concerning German reunifi-

cation, Dr. Foust claimed that
this problem must be solved by
the Germans without outside in-
terference. He also insisted that
Berlin remain a free city, since
there are two German states
and there are no negotiations
between them.

The Soviet Union, declared
Dr. Foust, is actively seeking
general disarmament. The
U.S.S.R. has reduced its army
by one-third, and has accepted
the inspection proposals.

According to the Soviet po-
sition, Dr. Foust concluded,
the West is the side that is

Racial Difficulties

Henry Shue, student body

student conferences on the
problem of race relations in a
DAVIDSONIAN interview this
week. Both conferences will be
held next week, one being at
