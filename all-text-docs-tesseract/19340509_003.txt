“Prayer” Is Subject of Talks by
Humphrey and Morrow at
Vespers

LED BY SENIOR CLASS

Vocal Duet Furnishes Music for
Meeting

The natural beauties of the Davidson
campus were the setting for the an-
nual Senior class vesper services last
Sunday evening, as members of the
student body gathered under the trees
between Chambers and the Phi Hall.

The services were presided over by
«red Smyre, who introduced the two
speakers, E. J. Humphrey and R. C.
Morrow. ‘The group was led in prayer
by A. H. Manson. Immediately after
Humphrey spoke, Mrs. G. R. Vowles
and Mrs, N. G,. Pritchett rendered a
vocal duet, by A. D.
Wauchope.

accompanied

The general theme for the service
was prayer, which was first discussed
by Humphrey, who spoke on “ Living
Prayer.” He sketched first the founda-
tions which most of us have for our
prayer life, saying that it was largely
due to the influences we received at
home from our parents, “ Prayer,” he
said, “is not like a cloak, which is to
be put on and taken off at will, only
when we need it. Neither is it to be
regarded as a ceremony useful only
on Sunday or when we feel that we
have some special need for it. Prayer
is rather living in fellowship with
God.” The speaker stressed the need
of faith in prayer as his final. point,
closing by quoting a short poem on
faith,

Morrow, following the general theme
of prayer, spoke on the answers to our
prayers. He cited several specific in-
stances of very definite answers to
prayers with which he was familiar.
He brought out the fact that God did
not always answer our prayers as we
would like to have them answered, be-
cause we are incapable of always
knowing just what is best for our-
selves. . Rather than regret, we should
be glad that some of our prayers are
not answered. He reminded us that
God cannot be coerced as the heathen
sometimes try to force their gods: to
help them. Morrow characterized
prayer as “the sharing of your feel-
ings with God at all times.” Emphasis
was laid on two-way prayer, or God's
speaking to us as well as our speaking
to God. We should seek the guidance
of God on all questions which con-
front us.

“Y” Cabinet Will Hold
Party at Montreat

Professor and Mrs. Schenck Will
Chaperone Outing

Members of the old Y. M. C. A. Gab-
inet are leaving Saturday for Montreat,
N. C, where they will have their an-
nual house party. Professor and Mrs.
L. B. Schenck will act as chaperones
for the affair, and each member has
invited a girl,

For several years it has been the
custom of the retiring “Y.” Cabinet to
have a last get-together at the end of
each school year. Last year the Cab-
ient also gave a house party in Mon-
treat, inviting, girls for the occasion,
and such a good time was had that
the members of this year’s Cabinet de-
cided to try the same plan. Professor
and Mrs, Schenck also acted as chap-
erones last year.

The Cabinet is composed of the fol-
lowing: W. M. Thompson, president;
Tom Phifer, vice-president; Bob Coit,
vice-president; Sam Wiley, general
secretary; Rufus Morrow, who is in
charge of plans for the house party;
Lynn Huie, Bill Johnson, Alec Mc-
Geachy, Sam Nickey, E, L. Powell,
Francis Scott, Fred Smyre, W. T.
Thompson, and Julian West. Members
of the party will return some time
Monday morning.

Student Registrations
Rapidly Approach Limit

According to a statement by F. W.
Hengeveld, registrar, made—last-Mon-
day, the registrations for next year
appear very encouraging. Already 425
old students have signified their in-
tention to return to the college for the
1934-35 session, and the registration for
first-year men is far above the num-
ber registered at this time last year.

Mr. Hengeveld said that at the pres-
ent rate, the limit for the Freshman
|class for next year would be reached
toward the early part of the summer
vacation,

Dr. F. C. Brown Ends
Annual “Y” Services

Subject of Last Address Is “What
Lack I Yet?”

The final session of the Y. M. C. A.
spring services was brought to a close
last Wednesday night, May 2, by Dr.
Frank C, Brown, of the Bream Me-
morial Church of Charleston, W. Va.

This vesper service, which was the
last of a series of eight, had as its
theme, “What Lack I Yet?” In his
own illustrative style, Dr. Brown
brought forth that no matter how
many virtues a man had, if he failed
to follow Christ, he was infinitely lack-
ing. He ended by asking, “When
Jesus calls, what answer will you
give?”

An account of the first two days’
services appeared in the last David-
sonian, The Tuesday morning service
had as its subject, “What I Am,” This
talk was concerned with ‘“masquerad-
ing,” fooling yourself and others by
playing a part rather than being your
real self. He urged everyone to be
true to themselves,

The subject of the Tuesday night
service was “the danger of losing sight
cf God.” He cited as an example Lot's
choice of the fertile side of the Jordan.
In this choice he and his family lost
sight of God and he failed because of
the lost communication,

Wednesday morning Dr. Brown
talked of the race of life and the con-
stant comparison of life to a race in
the Bible. “Life,” he said, “is an en-
durance race,” and preparation is nec-
essary, This preparation is training,
discipline, and self-control, and is es-
sential for the mastery of the race.
The starter is Christ, and we must rid
ourselves of besetting sins that impede
us. The runner must also have com-
munion with God,

Beside his regular talks, Dr. Brown
held numerous individual conferences.
All students confronted with problems
were invited to make appointments
with him,

Le Cercle Francais Entertains

With French Program

The annual festival of Le Cercle
Francais, known as the Le Grand
Restaurant du Chat qui Dort, was held
Tuesday evening at the home of Pro-
fessor A. V, Goldiere. The affair was
under the joint direction of the own-
ers of this well-known establishment,
Professors Watts and Goldiere, aided
by assistants selected from the mem-
bership of the French club,

With an atmosphere of a Parisian
cafe, with French spoken exclusively
by the staff and patrons, the evening's
performance was a realistic imitation
of life in the gay French capital. The
guests were greeted at the cafe en-
trance by the proprietors and were
escorted to the desk of the Cassier
(Lanier Pratt, president of the circle),
who gave them an adequate supply of
French money, Tables were assigned
by Le Maitre d'Hotel (Professor Gol-
diere), Before the meal was served,
the guests were entertained by an all~
star cast which playd the well-known
classic, “Les Martins au Restaurant.”

Monsieur and Madame Martin were
impersonated by Professor and Mrs.
Goldiere. The part of their youthful
and ill-mannered son was played by
Prof; H, T. Lilly, Professor Watts, as
Le Garcon, demonstrated how French
food should be served, and Madame
Watts, as Lise, la Vendeuse, sold pro-
grams, “newspapers, cigarettes and
flowers, The staff then served an eight-
dinner of imported French
One of the most appreciated
of these was the French pastries, an
enormous tray of genuine Paris deli-
cacies,

dishes,

At the conclusion of the festivities,

tion of the moving picture presentation

on May 17, and for the last meeting
of the circle, to be held shortly before

cers will be elected, diplomas awarded,
