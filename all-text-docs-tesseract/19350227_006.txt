To Charlotte Jaycees

Norton G. Pritchett, director of ath-
letics at Davidson, spoke to the Char-
ldfte Junior Chamber of Commerce at
their regular weekly meeting Jast
Wednesday.

Captain Pritchett's talk was in prep-
aration for the indoor track meet which
was held Monday.

Pritchett said in hiS talk that he be-
lieved that track is the cleanest and, finest
of all sports and that he had seen men
work out their own salvation on the track
and who otherwise would not have par-

| ticipated in athletics.

Aiter expressing interest in the indoor
meet, Pritchett said that it would be one
of the most worthwhile events that the

Discusses Music

“How did you become interested in
the band?”

“When the American Legion donated
band instruments to .the high school, I
was delegated to supervise the use of the
instruments. I became so interested in
the work, that I took it on as a perma-
nent sideline. Eventually it took so much
time that, rather than give up the band,
I gave up my business interests. I've
been with the band for ten years.”

“What part of your band do you stress
the most?” Sy

“T have always emphasized sight-read-
ing as absolutely essential. At every
practice. I give the band one unfamiliar
selection to read through. To this, I
attribute the fact that many of our. boys
have secured first chairs in college
bands.”

“What is your greatest difficulty with
the band?”

“Tone, probably. any band the
ultimate aim is to acquire a perfection
of tone, which is never quite reached.”

After more or less informa] discus-
sion in a lighter vein, I left, knowing
that Mr. Harper had to return to Lenoir
that night.

er returns to his Atma Mater, showing
himself one of Davidson's staunchest sup-

experience, then listed the three major
problems which must be faced once re-
covery is begun. “While the depression
is not at an end, we are pretty safe in
believing we are on the road to recov-
ery,” Dr. Nathan stated.

Saturday morning the, interest cen-
tered around a discussion group on the
question, “Should Munitions Industry
Remain in Private Hands or in the
Control of the Government?” This group
meeting was conducted by Dr. C. B. Gos-
nell, Emory University, and Dr. J. M.
McConnell, Davidson.

This question provoked a very hot dis-
cussion, as it has been chosen by most
collegiate debating teams for their reg-
ular debates this year, and as, in view
of recent investigations, it has become
a matter of universal interest. At the
close of the discussion period,.the group

voted 141 to 7 in favor of government
control.

In the regular annual business meet-
ing which followed, these officers for the
coming year were selected: William Bo-
mar, Wofford College, first vice-presi-
dent; Peggy Birch, Randolph-Macon, sec-
ond vice-president; and Edward Sell,
University of Georgia, recording secre-
tary. Other officers will be chosen by
the host college of the next conference.

Tentative invitations were received for
the convention next year, but a definite
decision as to the next place of meeting
was deferred until a later time.

The meeting closed with the luncheon
session Saturday.

Officers of this conference were:
Charles Lucas, Davidson, president;
Arsen Yakoubian, University of Ala-
bama, first vice-president; Zuline Mor-
ris, Brenau College, second vice-presi-
dent; ‘W. C. Neill, Davidson, correspond-
ing secretary; Mary Lou Klauber, Ran-
dolph-Macon, recording secretary; War-
ner DuBose, Davidson, treasurer.
