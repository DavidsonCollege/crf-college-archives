Major Weems, a former instruc-
tor in R. QO. T. C. here at David-

son, revisited the campus during
the past week.
When he first came here as an

instructor in R. O. T. C,, in 1923, the
officer corps was not functiohing
very strongly, there being at that
time only two senior officers and
three junior ones. We had in 1927,
however, when he left, an increased
staff of officers and four men em-
ployed. teaching and working
around the Armory. In the 1927 an-
nual there is a picture of the fresh-
man wrestling team of which Cap-
tain Weems was coach, and a men-
tion of the fact that they were un-
defeated.

While here, Major Weems ex-
pressed a very favorable opinion of
the college as follows: “I take ad-
vantage of-every opportunity to re-
turn to Davidson College and have
come back during all my vacations

Christmas Magazine
To Appear Tuesday

The of the
“Scripts 'n Pranks” will appear
in the local mail boxes about
December 15, This edition will be
full of Christmas news, Christ-
mas jokes, Christmas joy and
what not, according to the edi-
tor, Hal Overton, and the maga-
zine will be full of its usual hu-
mor, plus satire and rhyme.

When the first edition of the
“Scripts 'n Pranks” appeared on
the campus, there was much in-
terest shown. The interest for
the second = edition is running
even higher than for the first
one.

The front page was planned
by Overton and will consist of
something new dealing with
Christmas. The inside will have
a different effect for this issue. It
is planned to have cartoons in
color, which will be a new at-
traction. The cartoons will be
contributed by Richard Vowles,

Professors Will Go
To Language Meeting

The 53rd annual meeting of the
Modern Language Association of
America will be held December 29,
30 and 31 at Richmond and Wil-
liamsburg, Va. Hosts will be the
College of William and Mary and
the University of Richmond.

Associated with these meetings
will be those of several local asso-
ciations, including the South Atlan-
tic Modern Language Association,
which this year gave up its regular
November meeting in order to
merge for this year with the na-
tional body.

@ Of the Davidson faculty it is
probable that the meetings will be
attended by Professors F. L. Blythe,
W. P. Cumming, H. T. Lilly, E. J.
Erwin, A. V. Goldiere, G. R. Vowles
and G. B. Watts and perhaps oth-

Imaginary Debate on Sub-

FOREMAN vs. THE DEVIL

Minister Speaks "For Both
Devil and Himself

Dr. kK. J. Foreman, Professor
of Bible and Philosophy Here,
presented an imaginary de-
bate on the subject of morals,
between himself and the Devil,
in the vesper service last Sun-

day evening

He introduced the novel sermon
in this manner: “L have asked to
this service a guest, one who has

been here often before, but never
in an official capacity. He, an ex-
perienced debater, will try to dis-

to those persons who did not choose
to aceept the idea of personalized
sin that they depersonalize the idea

which he chose to personalize

Then Dr. Foreman ‘summarized
the arguments, “part lies, part half
truths,” advanced by his opponent
and answered them. He coneluded
by reading the parable of the house
built onothe sands “beyond good
and evil” and the one built on the
rock of sound morals.

Dr. Foreman has been at Day
idson for the last two years when
he returned from a leave of ab
sence during which he studied at

Yale.
