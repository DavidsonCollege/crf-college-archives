The Eyes of Her Essence

None will usurp his height

The magnitude achieved
Squalor will remain at his feet
For his eyes deny it sight

The giant agony of the world

Is but a stone bruis

Is but a stone bruise

To his talented Turkish flesh
Dazzling a thousand

But taking only one -

And binding her with fierce desires
Cutting her feet with rope burns
Tying aclean rag over her mouth

Separating her sad face with a streak of white.

He comes in healing

And goes to purer healing

Hoisting from one plateau

To the next--just an armâ€™s reach above.
She sits is state

Upon a captive throne.

She no longer remembers

That this burly man

Who speaks softly if foreign words
Was her choice.

She did not have to make it

But she saw in the eyes of the doctor
The eyes of her essence

And the home of her soul.
