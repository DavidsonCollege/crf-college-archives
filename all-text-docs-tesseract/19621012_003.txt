THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE THREE

HIGHLIGHTS

and

 SIDELIGHTS

BY BILL PRIDGEN

WELCOME FORMER FOOTBALLERS

Dick Grey, Teeny Laferty, Olin Nisbet—these names
mean a lot in the history of football at Davidson College.
These men will be sitting in the stands tomorrow, watch-
ing the game with the same interest with which they
used to play.

There will be many others—Dr. Ledyard Decamp,
Dr. Thomas Sparrow, Price Gwynn, Allen Mills, Dr. Jim
Hendricks, Jim Grey, Dick O'Hair, and Dr. Paul Maulden.
These men, and others who will be here tomorrow that
we have not mentioned, while perhaps not as great as
the three mentioned above, filled out the squads of some
of the best teams Davidson ever produced.

The important thing, however, is that these men,
although they have left their playing days behind them,
have not forgotten Davidson or lost interest in its
athletic program.

All of them are members of the Wildcat Club, of
which Dr. DeCamp of Charlotte is currently serving as
president. This club, in addition to its other activities,
once took over the providing of athletic scholarships to
the team when other sources were unavailable.

Several of these men have benefited Davidson's
athletics in other ways than seperti the Wildcat Club.
“Doc” Lafar, George King and Armfield, all of whom
will be in the stands tomorrow, are each responsible for
one of the trophies presented to selected senior football-
ers each year.

Some of the men mentioned above are trustees of
Davidson, and they also form the athletic committee of
that organization.

We are grateful to these men for all they are doing,

and all they -have done for Davidson's athletics. We
would like to extend our thanks to them.
CRYSTAL BALL TIME AGAIN

Too much dust has been stirred up in tomorrow’s |

big homecoming tilt for us to see the outcome through
the crystal ball. We'll have to forego making any predic-
tion on that one.

All attempts at predicting victories for West Virginia
have turned out successfully for us, so. we'll use the same
formula this week. Another win for the rampaging
Mountaineers.

Prediction: U. of West Virginia 15, Pittsburgh 7.

Nothing could stop the young Gobblers from VPI if |

they play like they played against tough Virginia. last
week, while supposedly strong. Richmond didn’t. farc
well at all against VMI two weeks ago. Most of the glory
tomorrow should go to VPI

Prediction: VPI 28, Richmond 7.

VMI takes a wounded tiger by the tail when they
play host to Virginia. The Cavaliers will prove too much
for the Kadets, even though it is their homecoming game

Prediction: U. of Virginia 21, VMI 13.

The Citadel’s jaunt up into Tennessee will prove
fruitless as Vanderbilt will be able to turn back the
Bulldog attack.

Prediction: Vanderbilt 28, The Citadel 0.

In a hard-fought contest between George Washington
and Boston U., Boston should emerge on top. Still smart-
ing from a loss to Southern Conference strongman West
Virginia, Boston wants to take it out on G.W.

Prediction: Boston U. 13, George Washington 0.

Furman, although weaker than last year, still has
enough power to take Howard, a team not too well known
in these parts.

Prediction: Furman 14, Howard 7.

Whittlemen Take On
The Citadel's Thinclads

BY FORREST ROLES
Sports Staff Writer

Tomorrow morning at 10:30 Davidson's cross-coun-
try team places its 1-1 record on the line against the
harriers of Citadel. This will be Citadel’s first meet of
the season.

Coach Heath Whittle eval-
uates the Citadel team as slight-
ly better than the team which
lost 22-33 to the ‘Cats last
year. “We expect plenty of
competition,” he warned, also
expressing concern about the
condition of his team as they
will be running during a dance
week-end and may not get
enough sleep.

On the other hand, Whittle

said that he expects sophomores
Ronnie Reese, Denny Phillips,
Chester Davis, and John Bar-
row to improve their pacing
with the experience they have
gained in the last two meets.

‘He feels that they have been

finishing too fresh.

Whittle also said that he looks
ior Sterling Martin to lower the
course record of 22 min. 35
sec. which he set against Pem-
broke last week, because the
course was slow that day.

The 'Cats’ next meet will be
with the powerful Paladins of
Furman, whom Coach Whittle
considers the team to beat in
the conference. This meet will
be held at Furman Oct. 19.

The triangular meet schedul-
ed with VPI and Catawba at
Salisbury was called off because
Catawba could not field a team.
A meet has been rescheduled
with VPI on Nov. 13.

W&M Homecoming ‘G

Headlining tomorrow after-
noon’s homecoming tilt will’ be
a band of wild Indians, William
& Mary style, imported from
Williamsburg, Va.

The game, starting at 2 p.m.,
should prove to be an exciting
one, perhaps matching last
year’s 31-30 thriller that David-
son took in the final minutes.
Both teams possess the poten-
tial to come out with a victory.

A look over the teams’ rela-
tive strengths would seem to
give the Indians an edge this
year. So far this season they
have two conference victories
under their belt, VMI and The
Citadel, and stand a good chance
of copping the Southern Confer-
ence crown. In their two -non-
conference games they lost to
Virginia and Navy, but not with-
out throwing a scare into both
teams, and dropping the Navy
game by only 20-16.

The Davidson squad can’t be
counted out, however. The ’Cats
carry an impressive 3-1 record
into the contest, and adding on
to the 'Cats ferociousness is the
fact that it will be their home-
coming. They'll be fighting to
come out on the long end of the
score.

Dole doesn’t expect to be at
full strength tomorrow, having
had several players shaken up
in the P.C. game that might not
be able to return to the lineup.
Dole also said that Tom Worrell
will be playing a lot more at
halfback this week.

One point that Dole did make
was that the team “has got to
play better ball this week than

last, if they plan to take this
one.”
P.C. GAME CLOSE

Although not unhappy about
the outcome of last week's game,
saying “We're happy
anytime we can get a win from
P.C., he pointed out that the
team‘s performance was not
what he thought it should be.

The Wildcats took that game
from the “Blue Hose” in a 13-9
thriller which looked bad fer
the ’Cats until they were able
to mount a scoring drive in the
