Trustees

Members of the Davidson
College Board of Trustees
will arrive on campus
Thursday for their semi-an-
nual spring meeting. Prior
to the Thursday session, a
meeting of the executive
committee has been sched-

..,/uled for the preceding eve-

ning
The faculty oath issue will
|again be fn the limelight. Th:

} commit ~ducation, headed

by Dr. M Hall of Char
lotte, has met to consider th
probleta and will report its find

ings to the board.

President. D. Grier Martin
states, however, that on the
basis of the prior meeting, he
does not expect the board to
to any substantial conclu
without further time to
study and discuss the matter

The board will hear reports
from its five standing commit
tees: buildings and grounds,
education, finance, religious and
social life, and student health;
and will take action concerning
the adoption of a new budget
and the addition of new mem-
bers to the faculty.

An important item on the
agenda is the adoption of the
, budget for 1963-64. Each office
| end department has made a re-
| quest for appropriations for the
coming year, and these requests
‘are now being studied by the
budget committee. With Mar-

come

sion

|tin’s recommendations, they
will be presented to the board
at this time.

The building and grounds
committee will discuss possible
action regarding the widening
of Main Street (NC 115) by the
town of Davidson. This would
{involve the gollege property
bordering Main Street from
Concord Road to Glasgow Street

Two final items on the agend1
will be the approval of new
| members to the faculty, and a
discussion concerning the fe-
| lease of a long-standing mem-
ber of the faculty.

Presiding at this semi-anaual
meeting of the trustees will be

ticle IV, Section 84: “Ordinarily
no resignation may be effected
during a session of the College,
and never without the consent
of the Education Committee.”
Dean Johnston said that he
felt that the Goodykoontz affair
was not “an ordinary matter
However he had no direct an
swer for the last clause except
to say. “I have been in contact
with the
through chairman, and
they have in that way been in-
formed of all action that has
been taken.” This committee has

had no meeting since Goods
koontz resigned last Tuesdays
Their last meeting was on April
22 eight days before Go nly-

oontz resigned. (For the thre

‘ports of What-happened at that
eting see related story.)

According to the chairman
of the committee, Dr. Warner
L. Hall, the meeting led to
“a recommendation to the ad-
ministration concerning Dr.
Gcoodykoontz.” From the facts
that have been gathered about
the meeting, it is clear that no
recommendation was made
concerning the resignation of
Goodykoontz from the faculty
at that meeting.

Last week in a signed state-
ment to THE DAVIDSONIAN,
Johnston assumed responsibility
for the action which the By-Laws
clearly indicate he was not at
liberty to take:

“This (accepting the resigna-
tion, effective immediately)
my best judgment and I am will-
ing to take responsibility for it.”

Goodykoontz expressed his
feelings on the matter in the
following statement:

“Unfortunately this bold as-
sumption of individual respon-
sibility (on the part of the
dean in accepting the resigna-
tion without a meeting of the

Education Committee to
specifically empower him to
do so) was not under the
terms of the Charter. His ac-
tion is a reflection not only
upon the dignity of the Board
of Trustees, but an unwarrant-
ed assumption of their author-
ity.”

Goodykoontz also commented
that the decision of the meeting
eight days before he resigned
(but after he had put up
controversial display in the Fine
Arts Building), if it actually had
concerned his resignation from
the college, would have amount-
ed to punitive action on the part
of the committee. “This would
