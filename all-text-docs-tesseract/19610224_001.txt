thor Of ‘Exodus’ Felt

He Had A Best Seller

By KNOX ABERNETHY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Wednesday afternoon. Uris was in the Guest House. THE DAVIDSONIAN staff

trapsed across the campus to meet the bi

g guest. As they were introduced to Uris,

two strangers wandered into the room. They were not introduced but sat down on

the sofa anyway.

Everyone was seated, staring
at Uris, who looked tired and
bored. A tall man in shirt-
sleeves came in, introduced by
Uris as his friend, Mr. Leshem,
from Israeli consulate in At-
lanta.

SMALL TALK

The small-talk began. Why
did Uris accept the invitation to
come to Davidson? Uris replied
that he had busness in the east
and also wanted to see Leshem.

Then one of the strangers
started in — a short, dark,
curly-haired student, What
about the reviews of Exodus,
that the book is a distortion of
history?

“Which reviews? There were
900 reviews of Exodus and they
were a hundred to one favor-
able,” came Uris’s reply.

ATTACK CHANGED

The attack changed; don’t the
Zionists view the Jews as a race
instead of a religious group?

Marlin Gives Details
On Congo Students

President D. Grier Martin an-
nounced Wednesday that the
three Congolese students who
may attend Davidson next year
will not be Richardson Scholars.
They will be sponsored by the
Board of World Missions, who
will secure scholarships for
them.

Martin indicated that their
applications would be processed
“more nearly the way we pro-
cess any foreign student” when
they apply. He said they have
not applied yet.

When asked to comment on
the speculation that the stu:
dents would be white mission-
aries’ sons, Martin stated, “No,
these are not missionaries’
sons.”

Martin told of a letter he re-
ceived several days ago from
nine Davidson alumni in the
Congo approving the action of
the Trustees and stating their
“eonviction of its importance.’

Mrs. Moore, Supervisor of
Dormitories, indicated that the
Congolese students will prob-
ably be placed in upperclass-
men dormitories. She said that
she has “had three students al-
ready volunteer to room with
the Congolese students.”

Leshem replied while Uris
drummed his fingers. Jews are
an ethnic group, he stressed.

After Leshem had traced the
development and history of
Judaism and the state. of
Israel, there was opportunity
for an interruption. After a
few barbed coments, the fight
was put eff until that night's
panel, and the small talk re-
sumed.

Concerning Uris's quote in
Time, in which he is reported
as citing Exodus’s sales record
as proof of its literary merit,
Uris replied, “What I have to
say is between the covers of a
book.” He professed no argue-
ment with Time, though he
considered it less than objective.

‘EXODUS’ INSPIRATION

Uris explained that Exodus
was not inspired by any particu-
lar incident, but had been trig-
gered more by the Declaration
of Independence of the State of
Israel than by anything else.
“They took their guns in their
hands and solved their own
problems.”

He used the phrase “a good
piece of fiction at the right
time” in reply to a question
about the impact of Exedus.
“I felt like I had a big book all
the time,” he commented,

MOVIES

In reference to movies, he felt
that he got more satisfaction
out of writing a book than from
turning out a film, because it
was more of an individual ac-
complishment. Nevertheless, he
commented that he found film
work very exciting.

Exodus Revisited, he said, was
the result of a trip through
Israel with a Greek photog-
rapher friend, and they just
happened to take pictures. They
later realized that they had ma-
terial for a book, and Exodus
Revisited was the result.

“I always had a yen to write;
it’s my way of expressing my-
self.. Other people steal; others
rape: I write," Uris responded
to the question of why he be-
came a writer.

FUTURE BLANK

He then got on to his future
plans. which involved going to
Europe shortly after he left
Davidson to start work on an-
other novel about post-war
Berlin, particularly the airlift,
'twhich he felt was “one of the

most important battles of the
twentieth century.”

He explained that he had to
make all sorts of contacts with
the Air Force, interpreters, and
government officials, and then
do very extensive research in
books, films, and. travel, He
pointed out that research for
his books generally took much
longer than the writing.

NEW NOVEL

His new novel, Mila 18, will
be published in June. The pro-
duct of several years’ work, it
concerns the Warsaw Ghetto.

Uris was now ready to lie
down and take a nap. The party
broke up; the strangers turned
out to be two students from
William and Mary — the editor
and associate editor of the Col-
lege newspaper.

They had a special bone to
pick with Uris. They were
representatives of American
Council of Judaism, an organiza-
tion bitterly opposed to Zion-
ism. They kept picking through.
out Uris’ stay.

Highlights
Uris’ Visit

By BILL RUTH
Davidsonian Staff Writer

“Tl give you my attor-
ney’s name,”’said Leon Uris
to an Arab man questioning
the noted author in last
Wednesday night’s Book-of-
the-Year discussion. When
the Arab suggested a pos-
sible law suit, Uris replied,
“You'll have to stand in line,
there are others ahead of
you.”

This panel discussion was one
of the highlights of Uris’s two-
day visit. It was followed by a
coffee and open discussion dur-
ing which Uris and Moshe Les-
hem, Israeli consul in Atlanta,
answered questions concerning
Arab-Israeli relations in the
Middle East,

The Arab viewpoint on this
subject will be presented on
March 2, when Hussein
Kamel Selim, Director of the
Arab information Center, will
speak in assembly. Selim was
to have participated in Wed.
nesday’s discussion, but cer-
tain issues of international
diplomacy prohibited this.
The discussion or ‘“disputa-

tion,” as it was termed -by Les-
hem, brought an overflow crowd
to Chambers Auditorium. Par-
ticipating on the ‘panel along
with Uris and Leshem were
Dean Frontis Johnston. Dr.
Ernest Patterson, Rabbi Israel

- Gerber of Charlotte, Edmunds;

Hanauer of Washington, D. C.,
and Dr. Daniel Rhodes.

After an hour and one-half
of preliminary discussion by
the panel, a limited number of
questions were asked from the
audience.

When Hansver was asked
by @ woman in the audience
te prove the existence of The
Americen Council of Judaism,
of which he is an official
representative, he gave its
15th St, headquerter’s locetion
in Washington and stated,
“I'm giving the address in
case you want to picket it.”

urer must. be _ rising sopho-
mores,

saying, “I signify my willing-
ness to be a candidate for the
office .for which 1 have been
nominated and to abide bv the
regulations concerning this elec-
tion.” The nominations will be
closed at 12 mdnight.

The board also adopted the
rules which will govern the
elections this year. They read
as fo}lows: “Open discussion of
candidates and issues shall be
legal and is encouraged. How-
ever, combines or efforts to
encourage bloc voting or vote
swapping. along organizational
lines, e.g. fraternity or inter-
fraternity agreements to sup.
port or oppose a candidate shall
be illegal,

NO FINANCES

“Any financial support for
any candidate.in any form shall
be illegal.

“The penalty for violation of
any of these rules shall be the

have always been hurt by Da-
vidson's ‘disinterested majority’;
not enough people have taken
the time to cast ballots.

SPEECHES

“We hope to have everyone
participate in the '61 elections,
however. Everybody will be in
Chambers sometime during the
morning. It shouldn’t be any
trouble to stop in the lobby for
a minute and vote. If a person
doesn’t vote he’s got no right
to gripe about the officers he
let someorie else put in office
for him.”

Run-offs for the elections will
be conducted throughout the
week, As soon as no more than
five candidates for each office
have obtained at least 51% of
the votes, speeches will be made
in a student assembly.

The Elections Board is con-
sidering proposing a change in
the student constitution. Under
consideration is a plan to have
each person announce his own
candidacy for office, instead of
having someone else place his
name in nomination. This plan

will not effect this year's elec.
tion.

Board with the council at its
meeting Monday night.

The proposal for a Judicial
Board was rescinded by a vote
of six to five at the meeting last
week. Because of the close vote,
the subject was re-opened for
discussion this week.

The two professors were
asked to give their gpinions
and comment on the present
Honor System and enforce.
ment of the Student Body
Regulations. Both men ex-
pressed a desire to have a
more thorough education of
students ir the Davidson
Honor System.

“Some process of orientation
in the Honor System is neces-
sary before a student can place
himself under its jurisdiction."
McGavock suggested “If you
don’t have the support of a
great majority of the students,
you won’t be able to make the
system work.”

“But,” he said, “you would
run the risk of making the
Honor Court fairly inactive,
and a two-court situation may
be too complex, because a
question may arise as to
which court has jurisdiction,”

McGavock further stated that
“pressure on a five-man court
of the. type suggested might
make difficult an objective at-
titude on a decision that might
result in unpopular action.”

On the issue of a two-court
system, Thompson said “There
is little difference in the form
of the court. It is the will of

the student body, not just the
Student Council that makes it
work.'

He went on to say that “the
fact that you draw such a dis-
tinction between honor-bound
and duty-bound, Honor Court
and Judicial Board would make
the rules difficult to enforce.
The main question is how to
strengthen the desire on the
part. of the students to enforce
the rules.”

After long, discussion, the
council agreed that a separate
court would not be practicale.
It was suggested, however, that
the name “Honor Court" be
changed to indicate a wider
range of jurisdiction. This wilt
be discussed at ‘a later Student
Council meeting.

Jack Taylor suggested that
the Student Council propose
a three-stage program to
strengthen the existing Honor
System. This would include
a defination of the rules, in-
doctrination of incoming
freshmen in the principles
and regulations of the system,
and a strong enforcement pro-
gram,

The Student Council met in
a special session this morning.
The purpose of this meeting,
according to Henry Shue, was
“to decide whether Student
Council! members should con-
tinue to be honor-bound to en-
force both the Hoaor System
and the Student Body Regula-.
tions.”

“We're concerned because the
distinction between the council's -
being honor-bound and the stu-
dent body being duty-bound
tends to make ‘duty-bound’
meaningless.”

Sneden, who recently com-
pleted graduate work at the
University of North Carolina,
will be coming to Davidson
from Lenior-Rhyne College in

The new professor will as-
sume duties in e department
which has never existed on
the campus before, His com-
ing will coincide with the
opening of the new Cunning-
ham Music and Fine Arts
Building.

“With our new facilities this
is something we want to point
to more and more,” commented
Dean Johnston. “We will grad-
ually add more work in drama,
but that is for time to tell.”

During his first year, Sneden
will be teaching one course in
the English Department in addi-
tion to his drama duties. Present
plans also call for hm to con-
duct a two-semester course in
the history of drama.

that this nature of drama
would ever be incorporated |
into the program here.
