be given to me by Davidson col-
lege. 1 then was one of the luck-
iest boys I ever met. Now time
passed by rapidly. On August
29th I passed the last part of my
examination, concluding my high
school education (the school sys-
tem in Germany is different from
yours, but let that be a subject
for a future article.) On Sept. 4th
1 left Frankfurt, en route to Bre-
merhaven. Sept. 7th we. all (22
German exchanche-students) step-
ped proudly on board the US Army
Transport General Rose and on
Sept. 16 we disembarked from the
ship in New York, feeling very
happy to be in strange new land
of which we had heard so much.

BIDDING—CON .

(Continued From Page Two)
ject matter and selling points of
the different fraternities were prac-
tically the same. I think the period
of informal pledging (the last two
days) only tends to confuse minds
which are already congested.

The two.day high-pressure sys-
tem which was used for the first
time in a long while this year, not
only steals from the “getting-
acquainted’’: time in the already
short rush week, but, also makes
for hasty decisions based on snap
judgments and first impressions
which can be very misleading. ‘Too
often the smiles and manifest
friendliness shown during the rush
week days disappear, and, one may
wish after joining he had scru-
tinized that fraternity with more
care. We owe it to the rushee, who
is. sometimes naive as to the ways
of’ fraternities, to give him time
to make his own decisions about
joining a fraternity. If the rushee,
by his own uninfleenced
choice, joins the wrong fraternity,
then, he cannot blame those who
“hot-boxed” him for his mistake.
Also, when- he voluntarily (with.
out cutside persuasion) joins a fra-
ternsty, he wiil feel more obligated
to get in and work and cooperate
with that fraternity.

I think also, that the high-pres-
sure sessions tend to work on the
emotions, which are too ephemeral
to base a long range, four-year
choice on.

I think also, that it is a reflec-
tion on the judgement of the
Davidson freshmen to subject them
to the “hot-box” system of in-
formal ptedging. A boy 18 years
old and supposedly having enough
character ‘and mental alertness to
be accepted in Davidson is capa-
ble or should be capable of choos-
ing his own companions without
outside persuasion, which is more
often than not, on such short ac-
quaintance, disinterested in him
personally.

‘Therefore, I kay give the rushee
uw fair chance*to look over the fra-
ternities which manifest an interest
in him, and let it go at that, with.
out any two-day period of in-
iormal bidding, which will clim-
inate the breaking of impromptu
pledges and strained relations be-
tween fraternities. by this method,
the rush week, I beileve, will
terminate with more beneficial re-
sults for both fraternity and rushee.

BIDDING—PRO .

the informal bidding all frater.
nities have a good many fine boys
already pledged and are not 100
per cent in doubt: as to the final
outcome. It seems to me that the
fraternity and the boy can know
more exactly where they stand with
each other, and this should be help.

body was duly taped, impressed.
and afraid, we were greeted by a
chorus of boos and derisive re-
marks from numerous small boys
at the gate. This made everybody
who'd ever played baseball in a
southern mill town feel more at
home, As to the game, I will refer
you to the N. Y. Times, Sunday,
October 25, sports section. It tells
what happened. After the game
a few bold souls spoke. of going
to N. Y. City, but they ended up
at the movie in Highland Halls.
The rest were refused admittance
to the Cadet’s dance because they
neglected to bring evening clothes.

Sunday was cold and clear. We
were taken back over the Catskill’s,
beginning to blaze with autumn
fires; flown down the Hudson and
over the great city itself; back to
Washington, Charlotte, Davidson,
and so to bed.

CAT TALES....

(Continued From Page Three)

As expected, it was. Army’s
superior depth in manpower which
had a big hand in their win. Their
offense was practically unstoppable
when the starting backfield was in.
Another important part of the
Cadet victory was played by Jack
Mackmull, their extra point and
kick-off — specialist. Mackmull’s
kick-offs were long and wobbly
and the Cat backs’ had a_ hard
time handling them. The length

of his kicks kept the Cats repeat-|°

edly backed up,in the shadow of
their own goal post.

As the statistics show, the’ game
was far from all. Army. Lambeth
completed almost two thirds of his
attempted passes and Turner and
Sifford livéd up to advance - notice
by turning in beautiful pitching
periormances. Sifford’s bullet
passes shot through the Army de,
fenders several times for. goad
gains. . The running of Lambeth
and Sifford was good but several
times big losses cut down the net
yards rushing to 17. One thing
that Coach Jamerson won't spend
any sleepless nights over is the
fullback slot. Runyan looked like
a battering ram against the Army
line ahd should cause plenty of
trouble against teams in this con-
ference. Rhea Adams played the
best bali of his college career,
handling the fullback duties while
Runyan was out.

Though the 47-7 score doesn’t
look too good for Davidsn, just
take a look at the statistics and
then maybe talk to some of the
boys who saw the Cats scrap the,
mighty Cadets. If you don't agree
that Coach Charley and his boys

did themselves proud, we'll go out
on a limb and say that you're sad-
ly mistaken.

half on passes by Galiffa and a
final one by Bob Blaik, son of the

West Point coach.

The Wildcats threatened again
early in the fourth quarter, but
they were held for four downs on
the Army 15.

Auburn Lambeth, not only great
in his passing, looked very good

running, while the other halfback,,

Jimmy Sifford, received and passed
superbly. Chff Turner also threw
well and it was glue-jingered Mott
[rice who continually pulled in
aerials. Another bright light is that
there were no injuries to the squad.

Although the Cadets’, were too
powerful on offense, the large mar-
gin camt from passes to crack ends
that were too big for the Davidson
backs to handle.

The Wildcats did a more than
creditable job against the team that
won the eastern championship last
