At Oswalt’s Home

The after-vesper discussion group
for this Sunday, April 22, will ,be
led by Dr. William Harris at the
home of Dr. Ostwalt. The subject
is “American Influence in the Far
East" and will be discussed pri-
marily from an educational point
of view.

Dr. Harris is quite qualifted for
such a discussion in that he was
the director of a mission school in
Siam for forty-one years. When he
first came to the school, there
was only one four-room building
and two small dormitories. Now
pictures of the campus show four-
teen well-kept buildings with a
beautiful and spacious campus. The
school has an enrollment of over
nine hundred boys.

Dr. Harris is the father of Mrs
W. H. Kneedler and has now re-
tired here at Davidson. His home
is filled with many hand-careved

cording secretaty with Sam Cum-
ming corresponding secretary. Bill
Freeman captured the historian’s
post, Jim Fickeisen Pan-Hell rep-
resentative and Dick Liles rush
chairman.

Top man for the ATO’s next year

Grigsby as vice-president assists
him. Roland Englehart takes over
as secretary, Dick Perkins treasur-
er and Bob Boyd Pan-Hell. John
Neisbett will guide the ATO’s in
intramurals as sports manager,

Pete Kalogridis takes over the
Betas as president for 1951-52. Stu-

Crady, who was also fined $25
and costs in Recorder’s Court for
his part in the attacks, took the
stand only as a witness. George
Crady, brother of Brackett, proved
to be a surprise witness in the case.
He testified that ‘he had been
“slapped around” by police offi-
cers while on his way to visit his
brother in the police station .

Judge Hatch, who presided over
the trial, said of the whole inci-
dent, “There has been a lot of
talk about this case and the actions
of young. men of Duke University.
It is a rather dangerous situation
when 50 or 100 or maybe 300 men
get together. They create a psycho-
logy of mob violence.”

who will be remembered for his
interpretation of the “Holy City”
for the Easter chapel service. The
minstrel program then got under
way, and featured one of the most
spectacular events ever to be seen
around here—the lights go com-
pletely out, and all that can be
seen by the audience is a great
number of hands swinging back and
forth in front .of its eyes, keeping
time with the music. This is done
by having——oh ‘well, why spoil the
fun? It is something entirely new
and different, and should prove a
high spot of the entire program.

At the completion of this part of
the show, a full-scale minstrel just
like grampa used to see down at
the local burley-Q-house, your re-
porter, weak with laughter, was
carried into the halt for abreath of
fresh air ands a shot of Hadacol,
whereupon he returned to the audi-
torium, expecting any moment to
see Slick up on the stage playing
the washboard. He took his seat,
the lights dimmed, the curtains
opened, and lo and behold what to
iis wondering eye should appear
but a perfect replica of an old-
fashioned barsroom. This reporter
sat dumbfounded at the talent and
capability of the entire cast. Among
other campus notables were such
persons as Vance “Pavlova-has-
had-it” Mizelle, and Co., gracing
the stage with their interpretation
of the “Ballet Red Shoes”; Neal

In commenting upon the coming
event,, director Lambeth said: “I
think everyone will be surprised
at the talent and really good voices
among that bunch of beat-up ath-
letes, and ['m really hoping for a
big turnout, because I feel that it’s
going to be well worth it. Tickets
will be available at the door at a
cost of twenty-five cents stag, fif-
ty cents couple. The Foolies start
at 7:30, before the informal dance,
and I'm hoping to see everyone
there.”
