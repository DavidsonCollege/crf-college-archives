Gang warfare hits Davidson College

Many Davidson students feel as if
Davidson College is a bubble. Tucked in
the small hamlet of Davidson, over
twenty miles away from the crowds of
Charlotte, many Davidson students feel
safe enough to leave their dorm rooms
unlocked. But, beneath the placid surface
of the bucolic college, lie roiling waters of
turmoil. Violent street gangs, formerly
found only in large cities, have made their
way to the Davidson campus.

In their last report to the Mayor of
Charlotte, the Anti-Gang Office of the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg police depart-
ment outlined areas around Mecklenburg
County where they had seen large in-
creases in gang activity. Included in the
mostly poverty stricken areas of the larg-
est gang growth was the wealthy commu-
nity of Davidson College. According to the
report, chapters from both the Bloods and
the Crips have been extremely active on
campus since last fall.

Though there is a good deal of rumors
floating around campus about how the
gangs arrived at Davidson, according to
Campus Safety, they first came when

members of a Blood posse from Myrtle _

Beach, South Carolina matriculated at
Davidson with the class of 2007. Said
Mike Trelist, the officer in charge of the
Davidson College anti-gang task-force,
“We had the first indication of gang activ-
ity on campus at a party at Warner Hall
last year. One of our officers tipped us off
that there were gang signs being ex-
changed, and many students were wear-
ing what is considered to be ‘gang ap-
parel.’ Later on that night, the first gang-
related altercation broke out when a
group of students from the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity, which is populated by
Bloods gang members, challenged mem-
bers of the Crips affiliated Kappa Alpha

Black Eyed Peas ticket sales suffer due to
popular Campus Outreach meeting

Last Wednesday night, Davidson
College held its annual fall big-stage
concert in the Belk Arena. Despite ex-
pectations of a sellout crowd, there
were still more than a thousand un-
sold tickets at the time of the concert.
Said Concert Committee chair Jenni-
fer Ross ’05 about the poor ticket
sales, “This was totally unexpected.
We were definitely expecting a capac-
ity crowd for the Peas, otherwise why
would we have booked them? Early
ticket sales for the concert were so
high that we even thought we would
have enough money to give away free
airline tickets.”

What, then, was the cause of such
lackluster ticket sales? Ross thinks
she has a good idea. “There was a
Campus Outreach meeting scheduled
to meet at 8 p.m. at the Davidson De-
pot that same Wednesday,” said Ross,
“which happened to be the exact same
time the concert was starting.” Ross
thinks that students who were 4 part
of the Campus Outreach organization
were probably torn between which of the
two events to attend. “The main Campus
Outreach demographic of white conserva-
tive Christians, also happens to be the
major demographic that the Black Eyed
Peas would potentially attract.”

Students who are a part of Campus
Outreach agreed with Ross’ speculation.
Dave Lee ’07 said, “It was a tough decision
whether or not to skip Campus Outreach
last week to watch the Black Eyed Peas. I
mean I like the message the group pre-
sents with their lyrics and the effort they
put into their musical composition and

performance, but the message at the
Campus Outreach this week was life-
changing. Like I said, it was a tough deci-
sion, but I think I made the right one by
going to CO.” In fact, Campus Outreach
had their largest attendance of the year
for their program entitled: “Let’s Get It
Started (for Jesus). They hope to follow
up the successful meeting next week with
the program: “Where is the Love (of
Jesus)?” : :

The Concert Committee hopes to avoid
the problem of underselling concerts in

This large group of freshman girls chose to attend the Campus Outreach
meeting rather than the Black Eyed Peas concert.

the future. Ross stated, “Next time we'll
try to avoid scheduling the concert on
days when other major student activities
are going on.” In addition to the Campus
Outreach meeting, there was also a
Davidson International Association meet-
ing and a Concert Committee meeting.
Ross added, “We really expected that even
if the Campus Outreach meeting drew
away as many of the students as it did, the
community sales would be high enough to
still sell out the show, especially with this
particular band.”

Order fraternity to a
fight. Thank goodness no
shots were fired, but
since then, we’ve’seen an
increase in gang related
activities across the
board.”

Trelist went on to de-
scribe the effects of the
gang activity. “Gangs at
Davidson are involved in
any number of illegal en-
terprises. For example,
we have reason to believe
that members of gangs
are behind a wave of bi-
cycle thefts around cam-
pus. We believe that both
gangs have what are
known as ‘chop shops,’
where they take the bi-
cycles to be dissembled

* and sold overseas. More-
over, we also have evi-
dence that gangs.are in-
volved in what are
known as a ‘money-

underage student gives a
gang member money in
order to purchase alcohol
for his or her consump-
tion. On the whole, we
blame gang activities for
the forty percent rise in
campus crime over the
past year.”

Signs of gang mem-
bership vary, but accord-
ing to Trelist, the most
common include “the
wearing of gang colors,
which is red for the
Bloods and black for the

booze switch,’ where an.

Crips. Also, gang members often can be
found sitting in large groups at Commons
at special gang designated tables.”

Dean of Students Clark Restler is ex-
tremely disturbed by the developments. “I
would like to make it very clear that gang
activity is a violation of the Code of Re-
sponsibility and will not be tolerated.
Whether it is wearing gang attire or steal-
ing food out of Commons to resell, we will
prosecute gang members to the fullest ex-
tent possible. I do not want a repeat of last
year’s Self Selection night, when as part of
gang initiation, the new members had to
run around Patterson Court in their un-
derwear and slash someone at each
house.”

Most students are not members of
gangs and are bothered by the gangs’ in-
fluence on campus. Said Claire Willis ’07,
“I find it hard to sleep in Akers with all of
the machine gunfire going off outside of
my window, And, I can’t walk to class any-
more without seeing people outside of
Chambers selling drugs.”

Peter Cohen ’05 agreed, “A lot of my
friends are members of gangs, and it’s re-
ally tough, because I can’t throw parties
anymore or my friends in the Bloods will
get into a knife fight with my Crips
friends.”

Dean of Admissions Lisa McGill was
more optimistic. “I don’t think this will
hurt our US News and World Report
ranking one bit. If we can survive the
goose thing, and the ‘Skull in the Cem-
etery’ incident of ’93, then prospective
students clearly will look past the fact that
the town of Davidson has become an ur-
ban war zone. Hey, it never affected
Yale.”

Is the Union Café Health
Inspection sign doctored?

Even though the sign in the
Union Café indicates that it
received a 100.5 on the most
recent health inspection, thus
making it the cleanest place on
Earth, the Yowl wonders how it is
possible to be cleaner than 100%.
Using advanced imaging software,
we have created a model of one way
that the sign could have been
changed to read a higher score.
