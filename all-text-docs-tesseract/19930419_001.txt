WALT Radio to Broadcast Next Year

Station Receives Charter, Go-Ahead to Begin Programming

By Leigh Rawdon

Ever since WDAV wentclas-
sical, Davidson students. have
sought to fill the void left for stu-
dent run radio, Finally a group of
organized students made a con-
vincing proposal to recreate the
latent WALT, an alternative radio
station run for Davidson students.

WALT isnota new idea. Stu-
dents in the past have tried without
success to get the station off the
ground. Difficulties continually
arose including an extremely lim-
ited broadcasting area and inad-
equate student support. The last
efforts to begin WALT died in
1990 leaving little leadership and a
locked station in the basement of
Belk dorm.

Finally this fall junior Vincent
Choo broke into the station. Com-
bining energy with other interested
students, Choo played akey role in
organizing plans for the rebirth of
the alternative radio station next

fall. The group received a charter -
from the SGA last week. The ATC
denied funding because the finan-
cial support will most likely come
froma Union fund. ences tans

The executive board AIMS pis
marily to provide students with
musical entertainment. They have
been disappointed with the music
selections available on radio sta-
tions in Charlotte, which is “the
largest city without an alternative
station,” according to the program
director, Todd Bowman. The in-
tent of the organizers is to feature
alternative selections including
progressive, college rock, and lo-
cal music.

The station will also promote
groups which are scheduled to play
in the Davidson area. Bowman
specifically mentioned the bands
that play in the Union’s IPC (Inti-
mate Performance Committee)
concerts. He believes student at-
tendance to these concerts is lack-

Beetle-Infested Trees Chopped

By College Relations

Work to remove pine trees
infested with Southern Pine Bark
Beetle from about 20 acres of col-
lege forest land is now under way.

Thearea is located tothe north-
east of the main campus, roughly
between Grey Road and the col-
lege baseball field. The decision to
remove the trees was made on the
advice of North Carolina Forest
Service agents who inspected the
damage. Many pine trees in the
area are already dead, and others
are hopelessly infested.

The affected trees, and a 100-

foot buffer of pine trees around |

them, is being removed by a forest
products contractor in an attempt
to keep the beetles from spreadin g
to other college and surrounding
land. Only affected pine trees are
being removed, leaving many

smaller young pines and all hard-
woods standing. The area will be
replanted with pines next fall.

The larger trees being cut will
be turned into saw timber, and
smallerones will be converted into
pulpwood. Many of the trees that
are being removed were planted
by the college in the 1940’s in the
fairways of a former nine-hole col-
lege golf course that was located
on that land.

Alton Hipp, a N.C. Depart-
ment of Forestry ranger, said
Davidson College is not alone in
its battle with the pine beetle. He
said there are many areas of heavy
infestation currently in
Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, and Lin-
coln Counties. One explanation
for the current infestation may be
that pines were weakened by Hur-
ricane Hugo, according to Hipp.

encouraged to enjoy the up-and-

The smell from the grill, blue
frisbees, and great tunes filled the
airatlastFriday’s first Spring Fling
at the lake. As Julie Petty put it,
“Who could’ ve asked for a better
day?” Petty, Patterson court Presi-
dent, played an essential role in
organizing the event.

The day’s activities focused
on environmental action, and in
support of this, several Patterson
Court houses sponsored booths
promoting such thingsas recycling
and decreasing pollution by not
driving on campus.

SGA President Alden Smith
commented on the “Day at the

Lake” by saying, “Beside the fact
that the weather cooperated with
us, this is just another indication
that we need more campus-wide
events. The only disappointing
aspect of the afternoon was the
lack of faculty participation.”

. Most everyone who attended
enjoyed an afternoon of sun, games,
good food, and music by the lake.

Chris Edmonston agreed, “As
a college, we should do this more
often rather thanonly once or twice
a year. It should be more like four
or five times a year.”

Thanks to all who came out
and made the first “Day at the
Lake” such a success.

Spring Convocation

~———Knother concern ofthe WALT

initiators involves increasing cam-
pus awareness of events and perti-
nent issues. This would include
broadcasting actual campus events
such as athletic events and choir
concerts. By doing so, they hope
to enhance campus life by provid-
ing a diverse outlet and adding
another facet of variety to the col-
lege. Possibly, WALT would be-
come another outlet and voice for
students,

Union Outpost Director Pizzo Quits

By Mary McCrory

Since the Union Outpost
opened in September, students have
gathered there for evening meet-
ings and late-night camaraderie.

Until April 8th, Richard Pizzo,
the Union Outpost Manager, was
there to do more than take orders
for pizza and nachos. Through the
course of the year, he became a
familiar face and friend to many as
well.

What students liked about
Pizzo was his relaxed attitude and
generosity. “I went there really
late before my Humanities mid-
term to get a cup of coffee, and he
gave me a free omelette because I
lookéd so stressed,” said sopho-
more Shelly Mott.

According to Pizzo, it was nec-
essary to quit because, "I have a
real estate career, and working at
night was interfering with it.” As
the manager of the Outpost he had

to open and close, and was respon- |

sible for money in the cash regis-
ter. Frequently Pizzo would be at
the Outpost until 4:30 a.m., mak-

ing it exhausting to return to work
by 10 a.m.

Pizzo is originally from Chi-
cago, but moved to the Davidson
area four years ago. Before work-
ing for Davidson College, he was a
salesman for a photographic com-
pany, then started his own busi-
ness in Charlotte. He obtained his
realestate license last summer, and
now works for Lake Norman Re-
alty. He decided to take on two
jobs to help pay for his sons’ edu-
cation. His older son Tony is a

senior at UNC-Chapel Hill, and
his other son Tom is a juniorat the
University of Georgia.

Pizzo regrets having to leave,
because he liked working with stu-
dents, and very rarely had prob-
lems with anyone. “I enjoyed it, it
reminded me of my boys and it
helped me understand what they
were going through with their ex-
ams,” he explained. As for
Davidson College, he said,
“Davidson is very demanding, but
it will pay off in the future.”
