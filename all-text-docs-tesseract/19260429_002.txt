THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 29,

1926

Varsity Ball Team

Plays Four Games

The Wildcat baseball team left Tues-
day on a week’s trip through Virginia,
with four hard games facing them. Af-
ter playing Guilford Tuesday afteroon
in Winston-Salem, the Wildcats opened
the Old Dominion
against Washington and Lee Wednesday
V. M. I. will be the oppo-
nent today and Roanoke College at Sa-

their invasion of

at Lexington.

lem Saturday will close the Virginia

stand.

If the Wildcats cop the Guilford game
they will leave the state firmly entrench-
ed in first place in the race for the state
honors, this is probably the most im-
portant game of the trip. The Wildcats
will spend Tuesday night in Martinsville,
Va., and go to Lexington Wednesday for
the tilt with W. & Lee. The General’s
baseball team this year is one of the
best they have produced in recent years
and Captain Alford and his mates will
have a tough time in winning a decision
over the “Minks.”

The game with V, M. I. today is a
formidable one as the Cadets also have a
winning club. Little is known of the
comparative strength of Roanoke Col-
lege who will take the Davidson team on
tomorrow.

The squad will enjoy a two: day lay-

Wildcats Are Smothered Under an
Avalanche of Hits and Effective
Pitching

The Wildcat sluggers met with defeat
in the games with Furman on Wednes-
day, and Clemson off Thursday. The
Purple Hurricane made a total of ten
runs to the Wildcats’ three, while Clem-
son Tigers overcame the Cats, 9 to o.

In the first game the Davidson nine
fought hard, but the invincible Furman
batsmen seemed to take all the breaks,
which, together with excellent fielding,
gave them the victory. Huie and Oden
pitched for Davidson but they seemed to
have an off day and the Furman team
getting 15 hits.- Wood and Minnick,
pitching for Furman, allowed the David-
son nine only 7 hits.

Last week was a busy one for David- |
son athletes. Two varsity and four fresh- |
men baseball games, track meets for both
the varsity and fresh, and the state tennis |
tournament, combined to make up a
rather full six days.

Perhaps we talked too soon about Da- |
vidson having a comparatively easy time |
with South Carolina teams. Furman and |
Clemson put it all over the Wildcats in |
the sand-lot pastime, while the Tigers |
won a, triangular track meet last Satur- |
day at Clemson in which Davidson and |
Georgia Tech took part.

The farmers-to-be garnered 57 and 1-3
points, the Yellow Jackets 43 and 1-3,
while the local Presbyterians could amass
only 25 and 1-3 markers. However, in
Goodykoontz, who won first in the cen-
tury and 220 yard dashes and finished
only half a stride behind the Southern
champion Roy in the 440 Davidson had
the high point man of the meet.

Down at Greenville the Purple Hurri-
cane of Furman continued its winning
streak in baseball in spite of the storm
warnings hung out by Coach Monk's
players. In copping this contest Furman
ran the number of consecutive victories
up to 11,

In winning the state championship in
doubles Davidson’s number one team con-
tinued to keep the Wildcats in the lime-
light of the tennis enthuiasts of the state.
McCutcheon and Carr ran through their
Duke opponents in the finals in straight
sets. Davidson has claimed four singles
and two double champs since 1921 when
Hugh Bradley started the ball rolling.

Clemson surprised even its most ardent
supporters when with Lefty Smith in the
box for the first time this year due to
an injury received during early practice

Goodykoontz broke his own record in
the 220 last Saturday in the Clemson-
Georgia Tech meet when he stepped the
distance in 22 seconds flat. In a pre-
‘vious track encounter this spring he low-
ered the old mark, 22 3-5 seconds, by I-10.
His remarkable run was made in spite |
of a stiff wind which blew continuously |
during the entire meet. |

Although the Wildkittens didn’t win a |
majority of their games on a four game!
joint about North Carolina, they suc- |
ceeded in trouncing an old rival in the |
Tar Babies. Coming from behind in the |
last few rounds of this encounter, the |
yearlings pounded the opposing pitchers
for enough hits to push seven runs across

the pan.

With Goodykoontz, Brand, Flynn, Kell |
and possibly John Currie here next year |

PLAYING THE GAME Freshmen Win One Game

and Drop Three on Trip
Through North Carolina

Effective Pitching and Loose Play-
ing Cause Wildkittens to Lose
Three Games

The Fresh baseball team returned Tues-
day night from a trip over the state that
resulted in one victory and three defeats.
They won the game with Carolina, but lost
to Wake Forest, State and Duke.

The first game with Wake Forest was
lost, 5 to 0. McClure pitched a good game,
but Davidson was unable to score any runs.
Harper played the best game and his fielding
was the sensation of the tilt.

The second game was won from Carolina,
7 to 4. Meadows pitched a fine game and
Littlejohn was the star of the infield. A
home-run and triple by Murray were the high
lights of the game. Ratchford and Adams
also showed up well. Carolina had the big
end of the score until the eighth inning, when,
Davidson came from behind and scored four
runs in the eighth and three in the ninth.
Murray’s home-run’ came with the bases
loaded. 0

The third game was lost to State with a
score of 13 to 8. All four of Davidson's
pitchers were used, Meadows being the only
effective one. State’s hitting won the game.

The fourth and last game was lost to Duke
10 to 7. Davidson led 4 to 0 up to the fifth
inning, and then Duke scored five runs. Mc-

Clure was knocked out and Meadows was
sent in. Davidson again got the lead, but
lost it when Light, who played on Davide|
son’s Fresh team last year, knocked a home-|
run with two on bases. Light was the star
of Duke’s team, with his effective pitching.

The bright lights of the trip were the
playing of Ratchford, Murray and Littlejohn.
Meadows was the most effective pitcher on
the trip, hurling three of the four games
played.

Junior Oratoricals. Pullen has likewise
been very active in oratorical circles.

Dr. T. W. Lingle is in charge of the
program arrangement and the entertain-
ment of the speakers. This is the first
time that this event has ever been held at
Davidson, and will be the last for some
years to come, being shifted to a differ-

ent school each year.

NETMEN COP TITLE

(Continued from page 1)

Bradley won the championship in the
singles. In 1924 Harry Price won this
championship and again brought the
honor to Davidson. Last year McCut-
chen and Price won the championship in
doubles and this year McCutchen paired
with Carr repeated winning again.

A match with Wofford will be played

on the Davidson ‘courts Saturday May

~

The Wofford netmen were the cham-
pions of South Carolina last year and
the Wildcats will be hard pressed Sat-
urday. ss
