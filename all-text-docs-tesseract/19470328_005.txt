Underelass Honor Society In-
creases Size

At a special meeting on Monday
night, March 24, the Beaver Club,
honorary society for underclassmen
elected new members from the ris-
ing Sophomore class, The Beaver
Club, whose chief purpose is the
entertaining of visiting athletes, is
normally made up of ten Juniors
and ten Sophomores. However,
this year, due to the greatly in-
creased size of the student body,
the members thought it necessary
to elect twelve men instead of the
usual ten. The members of the
present Freshman class who were
given this unique honor were: Whit
Cobb, Jake Wade, Bob Carson, Bo
Roddey, Carl Shepperd, Billy Rich-
ardson, Joe Warner, Dave Erwin,
Jim Sifford, Louis Bingham, Nor-
man Whiteheart, and Bill Alexan-
der. These men will serve with the
Beaver Club during both their
Sophomore and Junior years.

Another one of the purposes of
the Beaver Club is to sponsor any:
drives or other projects of public
service which Omricon Delta Kappa
does not sponsor. In accordance
with this policy, the members are
currently backing a clothing drive
which is also under the auspices of
the Y. M. C. A. The drive which
is being held here on the campus
is a small part of a world-wide
drive whose ultimate aim is to pro-
vide clothing for undressed Euro-
peans. As a part of this clothing
drive, the baseball game with North
Carolina State on Thursday after-
noon was turned into a benefit. The

Gets Letter

TO HOOD NORTON:

It was just a year ago today
That I called at your place;

I had had a sore taken away
That same day—from my face.

Your shop was always neat,
Your courtesy was fine;
Your service was complete,

Even to a good shoe shine.

You gave me a shave then
That I shall never forget,
Right at the time when,
I could not shave myself yet.

I may never come that way
In all of my life again;
But if I do I will say,
I would love theré to remain.

No matter if in your shop
Or out upon the main street;
You always took time to stop,
Any stranger there to greet.

I never lived anywhere yet
That brought memories to me;
That I could not forget,

I think of you and your son
Away down in the Southland;
And the town-of Davidson,
My visit there was just grand.
