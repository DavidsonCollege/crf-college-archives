there was much cheering when our opponents

Because we have lived a hundred years of
enviable growth does not mean we have
reached the full statue of possible advance-
ment. We can not be fair to those who have
gone on before, to those of iis who are here,
now, and to those who will walk these paths
long after we have gone on to let Davidson
be anything but the best it is possible for her
to be.
