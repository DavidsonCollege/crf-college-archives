CABARET SCENE

ling featured, made a big hit with the guests.

In the midst of the program Harllee}
Branch, who was chairman of the Junior
Speaking Committee, created quite a bit Bf
excitement by asking all who were in favor |
of pushing the tables back and dancing, to’
say aye. He got a loud and favorable re-
sponse from the crowd, but it all proved to
be a false alarm, and offered in fun alone.
The program ended with a toast to “The
Ladies,” proposed by Branch.

The gay chowd of beautiful girls, the
music, the tango dancing, and the brightly
lighted and decorated hall made the cabaret’
seem very real. The entertainment was a
success in every sense of the word, and set a
high standard for future classes to uphold. |

viously flied out.

Mackie almost broke up the game when
he crashed a long triple against the top of
centerfield fence, scoring Young and Webb.
Oden went to the mound and struck out
Jones, pinch-hitting for Dodderer, to end
the game.

Mackie, with a triple, double and_ single,
and Sides, were Carolina's star hitters! Harry
Vance did the best with the stick for David-
son, getting a home run and a double.
