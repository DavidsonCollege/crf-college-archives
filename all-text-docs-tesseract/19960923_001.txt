SGA watchdog committee to inspect “monopolies” on campus

By ANN HATFIELD

Staff Writer

Junior Class President Lucian
Dervan plans to introduce an SGA
bylaws change that will result in
the formation of a Consumer Pro-
tection Committee (CPC) for stu-
dents. This committee will seek to
explore the businesses used on
campus and determine whether stu-
dents receive the most for ‘their
money.

Students have complained that
telephone, refrigerator, and micro-

wave fees are too high and that
‘service is not good.

Dervan says that though many
questions are already under the
jurisdiction of Student Advisory
Committees (SACs), he hopes to
one day consider prices at Vail
Commons and the College Book-
store.

Dervan says that the duties of
the committee will be primarily
research, analysis, and making re-
ports to the Dean of Students, the
Office of the President, and the
business in question.

He charges the committee to
“examine those businesses which
hold monopolies on campus, and
act as a means by which to report
student and committee recommen-
dations on a bi-annual basis.”

He adds, “The first reports
should come out at the end of the
school year and every two years
thereafter. I hope that this will be
a means by which students will be
able to report any complaints about
businesses and have a more paw-
erful voice when it comes to mo-
nopolies on campus.”

Student viewpoints: many say companies
like BTI shouldn’t ‘pass GO’

If you're like most students, you’ ve probably resigned yourself to
the'use of companies like BTI and University Programs, whether or not:
you like their service, simply because they’ re the businesses sanctioned
by the College. But many students'feel they shouldn’t be held hostage
to corporate decisions they had no part in making, particularly when
they’re not satisfied with the offerings of College approved companies

Freshman Debbi Berry holds nothing back when asked about Erie,
PA-based University Programs, which rents appliances such as refrig-
erators and microwaves to students nationwide: “I’m really fed up.”

Joslyn Ogden, and Kevin Smith
were all elected freshman sena-
tors. Ideas for the coming year
range from Plant A Flower Day for
Earth Day, creating a shuttle sys-
tem to Charlotte, to making as-
sorted projects more centralized.

' The top vote getter among all
independent senators, junior Mat-
thew Hobbie, will assume the role
of head independent senator.
Hobbie’s decision to run for a po-
sition on the SGA was in part a
reaction to decisions made by the
Student Government in the past
and a desire to change things by

becoming a part of the Student
Government himself.

Also elected as independent
senators were junior Sandy Neblett
and sophomores Bob Lonergan,
Kirsten Recknagel, Kurt
Fesenmyer and Chris Tuttle.

The independent senators’
current project concerns an inde-
pendent Homecoming Dance.

“T would like the dance to be a
place that the students can go just
too hang out without any pressure.
It is especially important for the
freshmen to know that there is a
place on the Court that they are

welcome to come since they are
new to Patterson Court,” says
Hobbie.. ;

Sophomore John Bell, Chair
of the Student Government
Association’s Election Council,
says roughly 75% of first year stu-
dents voted in the first election
witch incuded 24 candidates.
Aproximately 71% voted in the 13
candidate run-off.

“To have that narrow of a gap
is fantastic,” says Bell.

Haselden says, “The class ran
a tough campaign. We were very
competitive, but we all got along.”

Town of
Davidson to

charge for Main

Street parking

By DouG PENHALLEGON
Staff Writer

The enormous growth of the
Davidson area has forced town
administrators to enact anew park-
ing policy for Main Street.

Beginning September 30, only
merchants with special permits will
be allowed to park in the majority

of ‘spaces between Concord and

(or,

' The new law will be enforced
only between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on
weekdays.

On the college side of Main
Street, the boundaries will be from
the intersection of Concord and
Main north toward Griffith Street.

On the storefront side, per-
mits will be required only for spaces
between Depot and Griffith streets.

The two hour limit will re-
main in effect on the storefront
side between Concord and Depot,
but will be eradicated for all permit

- spaces.

“Basically, it’s going to take
spaces away from the students”
says Butch Parker, Assistant Po-
lice Chief for the town of Davidson.
The merchants want students to
park on campus, and claim they
are losing business because of the
current strain.

Despite new lots built behind
the VAC, post office, First Union
and Cairn’s Wood Crafts, mer-
chants still complain they have no
place to park. They plan for their
customers to park in the 2 hour
zone between Concord and Depot.

The two hour limit was en-
acted three years ago to cope with
the “tug of war between students
and merchants,” says Parker, “I’ ve
been here for ten years, and its
been a mess ever since I got here.”
