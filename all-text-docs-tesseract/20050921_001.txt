CAT-TV adds
trial channels

By JILLIAN BARTELS
Staff Writer

CAT-TV added two Davidson-
specific channels for a six-week
trial basis that will end on
September 30. If these channels are
popular with students and the idea
is approved by President Bobby
Vagt and Dean of Students Thomas
Shandley, the hope is to have them
on the air permanently by the
beginning of next semester.

The new channels, channels two
and three, are being used as a TV
Guide channel and a movie chan-
nel that runs movies in the late
afternoon and evenings.

Last spring, Shandley tasked a
committee of Residence Life
Office (RLO) staff, Information
Technology Services (ITS) staff,
and students from the Student
Government Association (SGA)
with deciding what to do with two
local channels provided as part of
the cable services of Campus
Televideo, Davidson’s cable televi-
sion provider.

The committee, unsure of what
programming options Davidson
students would prefer, contacted
two companies that provide servic-
es for channels such as_ the
Davidson local channels. Both of
these programming providers said
they would be happy to allow
Davidson to run demos of the pro-
grams they were offering.

One of these companies is Zap-
2-It, which provides scrolling
channel line-up for any cable or
satellite system, regardless of
provider. According to student
members of the committee this
service was strongly desired by the

P.S., the new student-run restaurant, prepared for its opening on
Friday with a soft launch on Monday. Eleven student cooks prepared
a four-course Indian meal all day in the kitchen of Vail Commons and
then served 20 guests in the DuPont room at 6 p.m.

“[The soft launch] went wonderfully,” said Matt Hassett ’08, the chair
of the restaurant committee. “It really felt like home. We had some no
shows for the people invited, so we just grabbed people on their way
to dinner at Commons and offered them a four-course Indian meal. We
had a good crowd, and everyone was really excited.”

Students can purchase tickets at the Union Ticket Office.

Movie-viewing in Chambers not
Code of Responsibilty infraction

By MIKE TELLIS
Staff Writer

Davidson’s Honor Code allows
Chambers to remain unlocked dur-
ing non-academic hours as a place
for students to study, but recently
the administration has learned that
many students are using the tech-
nology in the classrooms for other
purposes, especially movie-view-
ing.

Rather than adding classroom
misuse to the list of infractions in
the Code of Responsibility, the
administration expects students to
voluntarily stop using classrooms
for non-academic purposes.

“We discussed early on whether
classrooms should be locked. at
night, and decided against it, trust-
ing in the sense of responsibility of

the Davidson community, not in
locks or in detailed regulatory

additions to the Code _ of
Responsibility,” said Registrar
Hansford Epes.

The administration feels

Chambers is equipped solely for
academic purposes and that student
misuse hinders these original pur-
poses.

“Not only does the equipment
get worn out, but the misuse of
classrooms causes lots of incon-
venience when these classrooms
are being used for academic pur-
poses. Often, students will leave
equipment on the entire night,
unhook wires and reconnect them
incorrectly and sometimes even
leave the equipment disconnected.
Precious class time gets wasted in

Gruber named
Dean of Admission

Gruber brings
fresh, compelling
vision to Davidson

By JOHN WATKINS
Staff Writer

Last week, the Board of Trustees
endorsed the recommendation of
Chris Gruber as Dean _ of
Admission and Financial Aid.

A search committee selected
Gruber from two other candidates
who made it to the final stage of
the selection process.

While the applicant pool for the
position was exceedingly strong,
there were a few things that set
Gruber apart from the rest.

“Gruber has particularly effec-
tive management and _ leadership
abilifies [and was able to] present
his vision in a precise and com-
pelling manner,” said Professor of
Psychology Julio Ramirez, mem-
ber of the executive search com-
mittee.

Gruber will be responsible for
managing enrollment, recruitment,
and merit scholarships here at
Davidson.

Given that the Dean of
Admissions is a vice president
level position, it will also be neces-
sary for Gruber to serve on the
President’s cabinet for “college-
wide planning, budgeting, strategic
initiatives and-enrollment.”

Gruber’s admissions plan con-
sists most notably of a process in

which grades and test scores are a
reflection of a student, not the
things that define him or her.

In shaping each class, Gruber
wants to find students who can
contribute to the overall student
body experience.

“Mr. Gruber was able to broadly
articulate not only an enthusiasm
for but a fairly specific plan for
Davidson admissions, electronic
and otherwise, with respect to per-
sonal engagement. Also, he listens
well,” President Bobby Vagt said.

The committee was looking for a
candidate that would preserve the
personal touch of the admissions
process and continue to target cer-
tain skill sets or underrepresented
groups, not just in terms of ethnic-
ity, but also in terms of socioeco-
nomic status, musicians, or science
majors to name a few.

Gruber hopes to cast an image of
the school that makes clear the
uniqueness of Davidson.

He believes that there are certain
threads that run through the faculty,
staff, and students that are unique.

He wants these to be explicit in
the admissions process and for
applicants to immerse themselves
so they can truly know what it is to
be a Davidson student. Hi)

Gruber came to Davidson as ‘
Director of Admission from the
University of Richmond last
January.

That position assisted the previ-
ous Dean of Admission and
