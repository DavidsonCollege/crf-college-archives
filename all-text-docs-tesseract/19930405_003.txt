Jessica Reinertsen Come on Down, You're the Next Contestant

By-Ceci Combs

A Davidson senior was both
shocked and excited to hear the
familiar call of “Come on down!
You are the next contestant on
'The Price Is Right!” Jessica
Reinertsen, accompanied by se-
niors Anne Sjostrom and Elaine
Bell, drove several hours and spent
the duration of the morning stand-
ing in line at a Los Angeles studio
in hopes of being chosen as con-
testants on the popular game show.

view for the show because she was
one of the few members of the
audience chosen to participate in
the first round of bidding.

Jessica had recently discussed
the costofbikes with fellow Warner
Hall member Lindsay Boozer and
was thus able to estimate the exact
price ofthe bicycle up for bids. She
won $100 in addition to the bike for

this move and got to kiss Bob -

Barker in the process.

Jessica played a pricing game
in which she had to estimate the
total price of five grocery items
within five cents of the actual total.
She overestimated the price of a
bottle of bath oil by too much, but
was not overly dismayed to lose
her prize, a bedroom set.

She made up for ‘her slight
overestimation by spinning well in
the spin-off.

Profs. Holland, Jones Receive Grants
NEH and NSF Sponsor Studies of Other Cultures

Dr. Gill Holland of the En-
glish department will spend next
summer studying the causes of the
1989 student protests in Beijing’s
Tiananmen Square. TheNational
Endowment for the Humanties
gave Hollanda $3000 grant for the
study which will begin with six
weeks of reading at Davidson.

Holland maintains that attrib-
uting the demonstrations to a call
for American democracy and
Western ideas ignores deep seeded

Chinese traditions. Instead Hol-
land believes that the students mo-
tivation involved anger about gov-
ernment corruption
andalove for China.

says that the students
were stirred up by
Western ideas and
were seeking to im-

Holland pose a US style de-
mocracy, but I don’t think that’s
true. I believe there were indig-
enous motives for their actions.

funded archaeological project to

reconstruct the political organiza- —

tion of the last unconquered Maya
kingdom. Jonesand his colleagues
from Southern IIli-
nois recieved a
$194,000 grantfrom

The project
evolved from Jones’
ethnohistorical
work about the
Spanish conquest in 1697 of the
Itza Mayas. of northern Guatemala.
For nearly two centuries after the

Spanish landed in Central America,
the Itzas remained free from Span-
ish rule maintaining their political
and social systems long after other
Mayan groupshad been conquered.
His research has garnered enough
information to make possible an
archaeological search this summer
for several capital and provincial
towns around Lake Peten Itza.
Jones and his collaborators believe
they can locate the ruins of other
Itza habitations around the lake
and in surrounding jungles even
though Noh Peten is the site of the
modem city of Flores.

Tones

Though the wheel is appar-
ently very heavy, Jessica made us
all proud by avoiding the tradi-
tional booing given to those who
do not spin the wheel all the way
around on their first try. She spun
an amazing 90 cents and (yes, it’s
true) made it to the Showcase
Showdown.

Though Jessica overbid by
$700 and lost her showcase, in-
cluding a ranch vacation in Ari-
zona, her bid was certainly impres-

sive. .

She would have had to pay a
steep 30% tax on the prizes, any-
way, so perhaps it is best that she
just got a great story out of the
whole event.

- Being on "The Price Is Right"

is literally a once in a lifetime
experience, because contestants are
not allowed to return. For those
who would like to see Jessica’s
adventures in T.V. land, the show
airs April 15.

Proposal to Put Responsibility on Court

Alcohol continued from page 1

police officer stationed outside the
house. The two “risk” monitors
would be similar to the former
“sober monitors” of years past.
They would be at the parties to
insure safety, deal with intoxicated
persons, and call upon the police in
the event of an emergency. The
hired alcohol monitor would be
there to enforce the one-cup rule
and to make sure that people show
proper identification before going
downstairs. The police officer
would be called upon to handle
emergencies or disturbances and
would have the official capacity to
give citations for alcohol viola-
tions.

Holmes stated that the “risk”

monitors would allow “students to
take care of themselves.” He added
that people would be more coop-
erative with house monitors, as
guests are to their hosts. Holmes
described this as a “shift in respon-

sibility” back into the hands of the
students.

PCC president Julie Petty ex-
plained that “more responsibility
would fall upon the houses.” She
stressed the importance of the
“risk” monitors and hired moni-
tors working together to support
each other.

The second aspect of the alco-
hol policy that the PCC would like
to see change is the necessity to
close down a party as soon as the
flow of alcohol has stopped. In
keeping with the encouragement
of a responsible atmosphere, the
PCC feels that this is a contradic-
tion. Instead of sobering up in a
“contained, monitored social en-
vironment” this policy forces stu-
dents out of the houses only to flee
off campus or to cause other dis-
turbances on campus. Petty feels
that “as soon as the monitor prob-
lem is solved this problem [the
clos.ag of parties] will be also.”

The third proposal of the PCC

allows for more weekday parties.
Currently the policy provides for
only two weekday parties per se-
mester per house. This amounts to
a possibility of 18 weekday events
for the semester. This small num-
ber, Holmes says, creates the “feast
and famine” cycle which includes
many parties in one week and none
in others.

The PCC would like to see the
policy change to allow for two
weekday activities per week for
the entire semester. According to
the PCC proposal, this would dis-
courage students from drinking and
driving to and from off-campus
activities and would allow them to
godown to thecourtat their leisure
rather than planning entire evening
outings.

According to Petty, everyone
on the PCC has been working to-
gether in a positive manner to help
benefit the entire student body. She
said, “We really want this to work
out for the good of everyone.”
