Flyers show insecurity and inferiority

Give them what they want:
co-ed dorms

The SGA has spoken once again. Tuesday night, those chosen to represent our
student body said “yes” to optional co-ed freshman housing.
This proposal is no passing fancy. This is the second year in a row that the

To the editors,

We would like to
respond to the individual
who feels he can speak for
“all the men out there.” As
many of you know, the
women of this campus
received a letter from this
man, which described his
feelings of sexual tension
and repression. As we were
touched by this show of hon-
esty, perhaps the use of
“howdy bitches” and “what
the f— is up, babes?” shows
why this guy isn’t “getting
any.” Simply put, this
anonymous letter is crude

and unwarranted. How this
man féels he can speak for
men in general amazes us.
He masked his personal feel-
ings under the umbrella of a
majority opinion because he
did not have the courage to
express them as his own. Our
distinguished gentleman in
question cannot accept his
own inferiority. Instead, he
choose to blame it on the
women of Davidson. He has
obviously forgotten that re-
lationships are investments,

not outlets forsex. The point —

of college is notto “get laid”;
we didn’t ‘see that in the

viewbook. Perhaps this man
should re-evaluate his rea-
sons for attending Davidson.
This man is shallow in more
ways than one—otherwise,
he would have signed his
name. If this letter is a plea
for us to “put out” more,
then he has failed in his mis-
sion to charm and disarm us.
What we have been trying to
say nicely without insulting
the other men out there is:
go to hell.

Sincerely,
Ashley Menger ’98

students have mandated a change in the single-sex freshman residential policy, and
it is time that the administration and the trustees listen to the students on this issue.

India group plea for mail

We hope that the proposal is not ignored this year by the CCRL and other
committees that it must pass in order to be put into effect.

Anyone on these committees, even if they disagree with the reasons to want co-
ed freshman dorms, should heed the students’ call to pass the proposal and improve
gender relations on campus. It’s the students who do the living on campus, and it’s
the students who know best what their living situation ought to be. They have asked
for this change twice now. If the students consistently say it’s what they want, what
more reason could you need?

To the editors:

As many of you may be
aware, there is a group of
sixteen Davidson students
abroad in India this semes-
ter. You might also have
heard that various forms of
plague are sweeping this vast
subcontinent, and the death
toll rises daily. Despite gov-
ernment travel warnings, this
stoic group, in its never-end-
ing quest for knowledge and
cultural enrichment, presses
onward.

However, living in the
shadow of impending doom
is taking its toll; the one
bright light in this fearful
darkness is MAIL! Our only
request is that you take a few
minutes fromyour rigorous
academic and social sched-
ules to drop a line of encour-
agement or support. Per-
haps KA could organize a
letter-writing party, or
maybe the student body
could gather on B.J.’s new
basketball courts. We en-

courage you to write now
because tomorrow could be

too late. Letters may be sent
to the following address:

Soccer brought to

May to May

a national level

On Thursday, October 20th, Davidson defeated Georgia Southern giving
Charlie Slagle his 150th career victory. We here at the Davidsonian would like to
congratulate both the team and its leader on this momentous achievement. In just
the past four years, Slagle and those involved in the soccer program have helped
bring Davidson and college soccer in general to national attention. Their partici-
pation in the NCAA final four, the USA’s World Cup team’s exhibition match, and
this year’s Game of the Week, have drawn sports coverage at Davidson unknown

To the editors, .

I would like to sincerely
apologize to Nat May and
the Union Board for the mis-
understanding caused by my
last article (“Whose Home-
coming?”). The offense
taken at this article was com-
pletely unforeseen and un-
intended by myself. Every-
one at Davidson College
appreciates all the hard work
that is put into the many

events that the Union pro-
vides, including the future
appearance of the AIDS
Memorial Quilt. In calling
the Homecoming Dance for
Indeperidents “weak,” I was
referring to the student turn-
out and not to the quality of
all Union-sponsored events
in general. However, I feel
the point of my article would
remain unchanged by elimi-
nating the offensive sen-

tence. No matter who the
organizer is, acampus-wide
dance must have the support
of the entire student body,
which is simply not the case.
The challenge forthe Union,
SGA, Dean of Students, and
all willing is to make this a
reality. Again, my humblest
apologies to Nat May and
others thus offended.
_ Sincerely,
Ken May

your cap and good luck in the future.

To the editors,
Over-experienced???
In response to Kimberly
Kreiling’s article, “The gi-
ant feast of Experience,” I’d
say she could use some more
experience. She is not en-
titled to deem herself “over-
experienced” merely be-
cause she grew up in (heaven
forbid) New York City. I
wouldn’t exactly consider

-observing tattoos and body=

piercing as a life-changing
process, nor would I find it
unusual for someone to read

foreign language billboards

in a subway.

I’ve grown up in seven
different countries, gone
abroad for a semester, and
traveled all over the world.
However, I would hardly
consider myself “over-expe-
rienced.” Experience is not
measurable, nor is it con-
fined to one’s observations
ina big city, as Kreiling sug-
gests. She needs.to realize

that Davidson, like any other —

college, is also an experi-
ence. Our school should not

be seen as an oversimplified -

“blue-ridged haven” or an

escape from “what felt like a

lifetime of shocks to the sys-

tem.” Experience is not ob-
serving “weird” things. It’s
taking advantage of life and
appreciating the environ-
ment you’ re in, realizing that |
everything is an experience,
life-changing or not.
Whether you like it or not,
life is an “experience,” and
coming to Davidson does not
Telieve you of your imag-~
ined experiential overdose.

Sincerely, .
Courtney Gilbert ‘95
