Question ‘of
The Week

What's

wrong with our pep
meetings? Why don’t we have
more pepper in our pep-ups?

Freshman! Freshman! That's the
cover—all accusations: but can that
be all that’s wrong? Is there
something the upper classmen lack,
or is it the place the meetings are
held? Should there be more shirt
tails? what some of the
representative students think about
it.

Here's

David Huffines, Senior:

Pep meetings have meant a great
deal in keeping the Davidson Spirit
alive. The game on Saturday night
was a fine example of what a fine
team and a lot of pep from the
stands can do. Our enthusiasm must
be kept-to-a peak, and it shouldn't
be left solely to the freshmen to do
all the yelling. Much encouragement
can be given to the freshmen by the
presence of upper classmen at pep
mectings.. Hlow many of us really
know ‘all the organized yells?

Dick O’Hair, Sophomore:

As a whole the pep meetings
seem very good and the Wildcat
spirit surely being developed.
Yet we still need 100 per cent con-
tribution to the yells, etc. and a
few dead pans can make pep meet-
ings a lot less successful. Also we
need more upper classmen there to

he was President of the Glee

with a commission as second

show the freshmen how to give
their all for the Wildcats.

Joe Martin, Junior:

The main thing I see wrong with
our pep meetings is the absence of
upper classmen. We all should at-
tend, thus helping to support our
team and not try to put the entire
load of producing pep on the fresh-
men. Besides more upper class-
men make better shirt tails.

Tom Brown, Senior:

Personally J think that the pep
meetings have been much more of
a success this year than last. I
think that the Freshman Class has,
as a whole, shown good peppy
spirit. Perhaps this. is because of
the cheer leaders.

Suggestions for improving this
spirit would include more bon-fire
pep meetings, more meetings
front of Chambers, and in chapel.

C. T. Daniel, Freshman:

The pep meetings would be more
of a success if there was something
to stimulate them. The “shirt-tail”
is a good idea because it is a harm-
less game (unless some more fresh-

men fall in holes) and a lot of
fun. This gives that needed pep
because it arouses the spirits of

the boys. There is much more fun
in having these meetings out of
doors as the students feel freer. We
have excellent cheer leaders so the
meetings should be successes.

C. C. Morehead, Junior:

I think the pep meetings are help-
ful for the football boys; they give
the boys a feeling that the student
body is behind them. The only
mistake I can see is that when the
football team is winning there is
plenty of yelling but when they
have a little tough luck there is
less cheering. This is the time they
need more pep—when they are not
doing as well as you would like.

Ed. Currie, Sophomore:

Pep meetings are great, especially
for the Freshmen, because it is im-
portant that they get school spirit
in the beginning of their first year.
A peppy Freshman class is a great
asset to college life in every way;
however, I believe the pep meetings
could be improved upon if more
upper classmen attended them and
joined in the yells. Pep meetings
don’t take very much time and if
the whole student body could get
together and yell ‘and sing “Oh
Davidson” once in a while it would
be fine, for not only the Freshmen
but for everybody.

Ross’ Parks, Junior:

The freshmen as yet don’t seem
to have learned what the true “Da-
vidson Spirit’ means, There are
entirely too many who are indiffer-
ent at the pep meetings. The most
glaring offense is the failure to re-
move caps when “Oh Davidson” is
played. There should be more and
livelier pep meetings with a few
shirt tails thrown in.

Hank Crane, Junior:

It's-an old Davidson tradition that
each upper class gripe about the
poor spirit shown by the freshmen
every year at pep meetings and

The staff headed this year by

Editor Hodges declared that the

in hand a long list ‘of choice new

ern Colleges.

is true, then freshmen from year
to year have become progressively
worse... But, why should the burden
of keeping “the ole’ Wildcat spirit”
at fever-pitch from Saturday to
Saturday rest solely upon the fresh-
men? It’s our Davidson too, and
it should seem that we owe it to
the team and to the school to
participate in these pep meetings
