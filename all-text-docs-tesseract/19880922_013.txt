This week: Shaping Up the Stomach

By MARK PUCKETT
I have been working my stomach
muscles every day for over two years. I
gan by doing 50 situps a day. I moved up
500 a day after a couple of months. One
day I did a thousand situps without rest.
Eventually, I figured a less time-con-
suming way to work my abdominal and
oblique muscles--crunches and leg raises.
Now, my workout takes under eight min-
utes and it works the muscles much harder.
I have read in Legendary Abs that you
should not do situps. They can have an ill-
effect on the psoas muscle which assists in
‘bending the thigh or the lumbar portion of
the trunk on the pelvis. Situps take too
much time and don’t give half the burn of
crunches and leg raises. :
The following workout is partly mine,
partly Mark Findlay’s in Joe Weider’s
September 1988 Issue of Mens’ Fitness,
_ and partly the author’s of Legendary Abs. It
works.
Leg Raise: Raise your legs together as
high as you can. Crunch tightly and lower

them making sure not to touch the ground:

with your heels. BESURETO USE ONLY
YOUR ABDOMINALS. Do not use the
muscles in your legs. Concentrate on using
your stomach. Place your hands (palms
down) by your sides or under your but-
tocks.

‘Crunch: With knees bent and hands
clasped lightly béhind your head; flex up

with your stomach. BE SURE TO USE
ONLY YOUR ABDOMINALS. Only your
shoulders and head shOuld come off the
ground.

Twists: Rest an unweighted bar behind
your neck on the back of your shoulders.
Twist in both directions using your
obliques and serratus (side muscles).

These are the basic stomach exercises.
Do the following repetitions if you are
beginning:

10 Leg Raises (Rest 10 Seconds)

10 Leg Raises .

15 Crunches

100 Twists ,

If you have been doing abdominal work
for some time I recommend that you in-
crease the repetitions and add the following
exercises:

U-Seat Crunch: As you do a crunch
bring your knees up to meet your elbows.
BE SURE TO USE ONLY YOUR AB-
DOMINALS.

Reverse Situp: Lying on your back.
Arms by your sides. Knees bent. Feet flat.
Use your abs to raise your hips and buttocks
off the floor. BE SURE TO USE ONLY
YOUR ABDOMINALS. aj

Twisting Crunch: Raise your legs.
Keep them straight up. Do twisting
crunches to the left and right. Findlay says
that this exercise only requires a small
range of motion.

Hanging Leg Raise: These are leg raises
hanging from a chinup bar. Hanging from

the bar use your abs to raise your straight *
legs. BE SURE TO USE ONLY YOUR |

ABDOMINALS.

Side Crunch: I can’t explain this one as
well as Findlay. He says, “your knees
should be bent as you lie on your side, most
of your weight supported by your buttocks.
With one hand behind your head and the
other across your stomach, use your abs
and obliques (side muscles) to‘raise your
upper torso. Repeat on both sides.”

* The following workout is the one I do
everyday:

25, Hanging Leg Raises (Rest 10 Sec-

onds)

25 Lying Leg Raises (no rest)

30 Crunches (no rest)

25 U-Seat Crunches (no rest)

20 Twisting Crunches (no rest)

25 Reverse Situps (no rest)

40 Side Crunches on each side (no rest in
between)

100 Twists (optional)

You may modify the repetitions, but I
recommend this order. Beginners--10 to 15
repetitions. Intermediates--15 to 20 repeti-
tions. Advanced--20 to 30 repetitions. If
you don’t feel comfortable doing hanging
leg raises, substitute another set of lying leg
raises.

Do not feel that you have to do every
exercise at first. Start slowly and gradually
increase repetitions and add exercises.

Remember to concentrate on your mid-
section throughout the work out. Feel your
stomach muscles burning. As Findlay con-
cludes in his article, “Visualize them be-
coming tighter, harder, and stronger,.and
keep that goal in mind. A ripped midsec-
tion is the epitome of physical fitness.”

If you think you are having trouble with
technique, write to “In Good Health” c/o

FOOTBALL, from page 11

high school basketball, but is not known to

‘be a high school football power. South

Carolina has good high school football, but
Davidson has not been successful in re-
Cruiting there, as there is only one South
Carolinian on this year’s roster.

Is there any hope for Davidson in the
Colonial League? Yes, there is. The team is
much improved over last year’s squad and
has only 5 seniors on the squad. However,
in order to continue this improvement, the
coaches are going to have to doan excellent
job of recruiting, and the players are going
to have to dedicate themselves to making
Davidson football competitive.

More Football!

Soccer Team Stuns South
Carolina be:

The Cats played. their best
game of the season so far as they
handed U.S.C. a 1-0 loss yester-
day. Davidson (3-5-1) and the
Gamecocks played to a 0-0
halftime score, and the game
remained a tie until the 9:57
mark when Curtis Ott scored on
a direct kick from 35 yards out.

Carolina put tremendous
pressure on the Cats in the clos-
ing moments, but was denied a
goal On superlative plays from
Frank Bricio and Jim Walker.

Sports Shorts

Both of these players saved balls
which were right on the goal line.
Doug Long made his Davidson
debut a memorable one in record-
ing the shutout. vs
The game was an especially big
one for the Cats, who were com-
ing off losses to The College of
Charleston (3-0) and South Ala-
bama (5-2) in the Lake Norman

Golf Team Off To Impressive

lock led the team, and earned
medalist honors, with a 75.

This week’s picks

By PHIL PRESCOTT
Oklahoma at Southem Cal:
Oklahoma is ina rebuilding, more
like reloading, year after losing
five All-American starters from

‘last year’s team. The only team

Oklahoma has lost to in the last 3
years has been Miami. Look for
U.S.C. to be the next team to beat

them. _ Oklahoma has trouble

beating passing teams, especially
teams that can run and pass, and
U.S.C. poses this problem. Rod-
ney Peete, quarterback of U.S.C.
is the key, his running ability will
negate any Oklahoma. blitz.
Prediction....U.S.C. 23-17.
Georgia at South Carolina: The
game of the week down South.

COME

7

Both teams have explosive of-
fenses. Todd Ellis at quarterback
& Harold Greene at running back
form the passing & runnidg duo in
for South Carolina. Georgia
vounters with a triumvirate of

. greatrunning backs: Tim Worley,

Keith Henderson, and Rodney
Hampton. Georgia’s depth at
running back should wear down
the South Carolina defense in the
fourth quarter. Prediction...
Georgia 35-31.

West Virginia at Pittsburgh: A
traditional big game up East and
both teams have their best squads
