First Scrimmage Held Friday;
Team Rounding Into Form

Scrubs Are Giving Varsity Plenty
of Hard Work-Several
Promising Freshmen

With a squad of nearly fifty working
out daily on Sprunt Field. Davidson
football prospects are rising. For the
past week the candidates have been put
through a most gruelling pace but the
practice is having its results clearly
demonstrated. The men are getting
“hard” and have gotten that old D. C.
fighting spirit back of every play.

During the first of the week. practice
censisted of blocking, hitting the dum-
mies, and signal proctice. Scrimmage
began Friday. Picking up a fumble
Martin, scrub full-back ran twenty
yards for the first touchdown, and was
kicked. A good scrub team means a
yood Varsity team. ‘The, Varsity evi-
dently realized the fact and proceeded
to score on the scrubs in eight minutes
of play, after Cassel, playing quarter in
place of Spann, who was out on minor
injuries, ran back the kick-off go yards.
“Red” Miley carried the ball over on a
forward-pass play.

Of course the Varsity eleven has not
been picked yet but the following men
have been playing more or less regular-
ly on Cooch Pete's Wildcat selection.
Miley and Douglas, ends; Hammit and
Me Master, tackles; La Far and Rome-
felt, guards; Brady, center; Black and
McAlister, halfbacks; Nimocks — full-
back and Spann quarterback. “Those
everlastingly scrappy scrubs have been
lining up as follows, Harris and Black.
ends; Currie and Carter, tackles;
Hamer and Fairy, guards; Long,
center; McFaden and Shephard, half-
hacks; Martin, fullback and Cassel,
quarterback,

Besides the regular applied laboratory
three hours each afternoon, the squad is
being instructed in black board talks
several evenings a week. Coach Crayton
is surely making the fellows play, cat
and sleep football and it’s “Watch Out
Guilford” when they buck. up against
the Red and Black on Saturday in
Winston-Salem.

‘he basket-balls have arrived and the
fellows are enjoying the privileges of
the “gym"floor these afternoons, Come
cn out Fresh, it’s free and you'll learn
to like a lot more fellows if you mix in
and rub backs with them.

“The tennis court” is being used each
day to its capacity, four men at a time.
“A” court has a ditch through it and so
far no work on the other courts has been

begun but it is hoped that soon there |}

will he room for every one all the time.
Here’s hoping the courts get some of
Davidson's quota from the Million
Dollar Campaign.

COURSE.

This course is given for students who
have a special aptitude for composition,
with a view to improving their talents
and make them fitted for writing fit
essavs, shert stories, and other such
writings for publication. The plan of
the course is not exactly made out yet,
but the aim is to let each student follow
his natural bent; that is, those who are
primarily interested in the writing of
essays to work especially for the goal to
become preficient in the writing of es-
says that interest and uplift the read-
ers. They will go back and read se-
lections from the old English essayists
for their foundation, and study different
ones on down to the modern writer.
The short story writer, on the other
hand, will study with a view to making
himself able to write stories that will
interest those who like the first-class
short story, by studying some of the
best of the modern stories. These writ-
ines will be criticised mercilessly, as
Professor Shewmake made it clear, both
the outside writers and the writers of
the class. The course will require a
very great amount of. work, but any-
thing that is worth while must be paid
for with a great price, and the cost
should be lost in the enthusiasm, be-
cause the courte has the brightest fu-
ture to those “who will put their shoul-
der to the wheel” of any in college.

Football Gleanings

Live .News About Our Opponents

As other colleges are opening up we
find that we are not the only one that
has bright football prospects for the
ceming season. Every report which we
receive carries additional evidence that
we are facing the greatest football sea-
con in the history of the sport. The
teams which we hit this year are among
those looking for the old men from the
army and their new recrujts to build up
a winning machine.

Practice has already begun at A. &
E. with more than a full team of for-
mer stars returned. The last year's
back field is intact, consisting of Gur-
ley. Murray, Hudson, and Faucette.
Among the large number out for line
positions are ‘Texey, center; Whitaker,
Powell, Stacy, Weathers, Lawrence
and Ripple. “The last named was .cho-
cen as tackle on one of Walter Camp's
all-American teams of last year, On
end McMurray and Black are now con-
sidered the pick for the varsity, though
they are hafd pushed by the large oum-
ber out for this position, “They are
placing great confidence in Coach Fet-
ver and are expecting the best team
they have had in a number of years.
‘The first game which they play is
against Guilford on September 27. This
game will help to give a fine on how
we will stack up against them on No-
vember 8.

Although the University’ of North
Carolina does not begin its collegiate
vear until September 30, Coach Camp-
bell has already begun to assemble his
squad. ‘hey are enthusiastic over the
return of such former stars as Brown,
Nichols, Kernodle, Pharr, Lowe, Fear-
rington, and others. On October 4
they are scheduled to play Rutgers at
New Brunswick, N. J. and on the fol-
lowing Saturday Yale at New Haven.
The annual Virginia-Carolina game,
which has always been played at Rich-
mond, will be transferred to Chapel
Hill to give the Carolina students a
chance to see one big game without so
much additional expense.

A big feature of the stason will be
the A. & F.-Carolina game. “These an-
cient rivals severcd = relat‘ons several
years ago and this game therefore is
looked farward to by both sides as one
cf the big scraps of the season.

‘The Georgia Tech team is being fast
assembled, ‘The “Golden “Fornado”
will put out an unusually strong team

but will greatly m‘ss the work of such |
wizards as Strupper, Guyon, and Hill.
They have, however, an abundance of
material, including’ such stars as Finch-
er. Staton, Dayal, Flowers, Adams, Da-
vis, Phillips, and many others who in
former years made such a sensational
showing.

The University of ‘Tennessee has
been given a new $75,000 athletic field.
From the present outlook it seems prob-
able that they are developing a team
equal to the championship cleven which
they put out several years ago.

The University of Alabama has been
fortunate in securing Xen C. Scott for
coach. It will be remembered that said
Scott is the man who was running the
Cleveland Naval Reserves when they

stopped the famous Pittsburg machine.

CHOICE OF READING.

(Continued from page 1)
One has only to glance at the life of

Mr. Page to see how genuinely South-
em he is. He was born on the Oak-
land plantation in Virginia and was ed-
ucated at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity and the University of Virginia.
Since then many universities have hon-
ered him ‘and he has become ca member
of the American Academy of Arts and
Letters, President Wilson appointed
him Ambassador to Italy in 1913, a po-
sition which he has held until this vear,
when he asked to be relieved.

Mr. Page is master of two fields of
literature, the dialect) poem and the
novel. ‘To the lover of shart stories
perhaps the “Burial of the Guns” is the
most appealing, and te those fond — of
longer books, “Red Rock” holds much
of interest. His poems portray the life
of the negro in the South as only the
works of a student and one who has
had the original as a model could do.’
With such artistic taste and skill, with
all the humor, force, and pathos of the
ald: Virginia “quality.” Thomas Nelson
Page has been rightly called the “bright-
est star in Southern Literature.”

Instead of reading the nondescript.
novel, why not store our minds with

something of use and instruction as
well as interest, When in the library
next time, look over the works of
‘Thomas, Nelson Page.
