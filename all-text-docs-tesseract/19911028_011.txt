In one of those darksome pits he would hide him,
From such a grave he could never come back.
_ So, without worrying more on the matter,

‘He tied poor Archibald up in a sack.

Down in that column he dumped him headforemost;
Laughed he with glee when the bones hit the ground;
Thought that his worries and troubles were ended,
But stop! Say, what was that horrible sound?

It was a wail, long drawn-out, and expressing
The untold agonies of a lost soul,

Trembled and thrilled like a shriek of the dying,
Rose up and swelled from the mouth of the hole!

But the scared mortal had waited no longer,
Down the dark staircase like lightning he flew.
Parted forever from Davidson College,
But--just think of it--he took the gold, too!

Where he had gone they could never discover,
Where he stopped running they never could tell,

Bhe one thing that all people agreed on
Was, that forever in terror he’d dwell.

But even now in the arcades of Chambers

We may hear, sometimes, the hollow-voiced tones
Of that sad Shylock that.asks for his ducats.

That is the spirit of Archibald Jones! yes, in truth
there’s no rest for the weary.

He cannot sleep, now his treasure is gone;

So every night when the lights have been lowered
Wanders he, ever alone and forlorn.

Some night perhaps, when you’re walking through
Chambers,

You’ll feel a wind that is icy and cold.

Something will touch you--’ twill be wetand clammy;
Something will whisper: “Oh, where is my gold?”

Then friend, delay not, but run like the dickens,
Get yourself quickly to fire and light,

Cross yourself fervently--Heaven will help you,
Spirits, at that sign, will leave you in fright.

But if you question the truth of my story,

Down in that column you’ll find all the bones

Of that bad mortal, whose name, as he told them,
Summed up in toto was Archibald Jones!

Condom Rankings

With more and more people
relying on c@ndoms for disease
protection, and with so -many
brands on the market, it can be
very difficult to determine which
condoms are the most reliable. In
March of 1989 Consumer Reports
magazine published the results of
its own investigation of latex con-
doms.

Consumer Reports used “air-
burst testing” to determine the
amount of pressure and volume
the condoms could withstand be-
fore breaking. These results were
then adjusted to account for the
number of condomsand lots tested,
and a failure rating was given to
each brand.

Two kinds of latex condoms
performed extremely poorly, show-
ing a projected failure rate of more
than 10 percent. These two types
are LifeStyles Extra Strength with
Nonoxynol-9 and LifeStyles Nuda
Plus. Both of. these condoms
showed thin spots, making the
condoms more susceptible to

- breakage in the airburst tests.

Of the 37 varieties tested, 32
latex condoms came out with a
projected failure rate of only 1.5
percent. The top fifteen of these

condoms are listed below (differ-
ences between closely rated con-
doms were not significant):
1) Gold Circle Coin
2) LifeStyles Extra Strength
Lubricated (without spermicide)
3) Saxon Wet Lubricated
4) Ramses Non-Lubricated Re-
sevoir End
5) Sheik Non-Lubricated Re-
sevoir End
6) Excita Extra
7) Kimono
8) Sheik Elite
9) Koromex with Nonoxynol-9
10) Excita Fiesta
11) Embrace Ultra-Thin
12) LifeStyles Stimula Vibra-
Ribbed
13) Ramses Extra with Spermi-
cidal Lubricant
14) Lady Trojan
15) Trojan Plus 2
Heat, light, and air pollution
can all damage latex condoms.
Condoms should not be opened
until they are to be used, and con-
doms should be stored in a cool,
dry, dark place. If condoms are
stored properly they can last as
long as five years. Most brands
print the expiration date on the
individual packets.
