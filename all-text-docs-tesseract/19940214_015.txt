Women's tennis hangs tough, takes 6th place in invitational

By David Dwyer

When the Eck Sports Pavilion
opened on the campus of the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame some years
ago, the inaugural event to be
hosted there was a twelve-team
women’s doubles tournament. The
women’ tennis teams from twelve
universities were invited to enter
one doubles pair in each of four
ranked flights. Noting the success
the tournament achieved over the
years, Davidson women’s tennis
coach Caroline Price decided to
copy the Notre Dame format and
establish a similar tourney in the
Knobloch Tennis Center. Over the
past weekend, the fifth annual
Davidson Women’s Doubles Tour-
nament was held, with a total of
eight regional teams in competi-

tion.

Entering this year’s field were
Davidson, UNC-Charlotte, Vir-
ginia Tech, James Madison, N.C.
State, Winthrop, Louisville, and
the University of West Virginia.
The field was split into two brack-
ets, and each played the three mem-
bers of their bracket, On Sunday,
the top teams from each bracket
played for first, the second ranked
teams played for third, the thirds
for fifth, and so on.

Davidson was grouped with
JMU, WVU, and NCSU, and
played West Virginia first. Be-
cause West Virginia only entered
three pairs against Davidson’s four,
an NCSU pair was added to play
Davidson’s fourthseed. With wins
in the first and third flights,

Davidson defeated WVU 2-1,
though the match went into the «
books as a 2-2 tie because the extra
NCSU team defeated Davidson’s
fourth pair.
Davidson lost 1-3 to both even-
tual champion N.C. State and JMU
in their remaining bracket matches,
and went into Sunday’s final pair-
ings facing Winthrop University
with fifth place at stake. Despite a
strong final effort, Davidson fell to
Winthrop, settling for sixth place.
“We got into a hole on the first

day and had to work from there,” .

commented Coach Price. “We re-
covered nicely with astrong match
against Winthrop, but it was just a
matter of execution. Kim Nance
and Cindy Hess (the #2 seed)
played their best doubles of the

year, but lost. We had some oppor-
tunities, but just missed them.” It
was, despite the outcome, a solid

effort by the Davidson players, the
type that could result in a victory
over N.C. State this Saturday.
