Davidson Falls In Big South Semis, Finishes 10-19

By Bruce Balestier
Coastal Carolina 58 Davidson
55 (Semifinals Big South Tour-
nament)

It was hard to believe for a
while Friday night in Anderson,
S.C. Not only had Davidson out-
played Coastal Carolina for the
greater part of 40 minutes (taking a
32-24 halftime lead), they had
forced a critical turnover with
swarming defense and taken pos-
session of the ball down 56-55
with 11.5 seconds left. Coach Bob
McKillop called timeout, and dia-
grammed a play for Janko Narat to
take his defender one on one. But
when the Chants’ Brian Penny
intercepted the inbounds pass in-
tended for Narat, it all went up in
smoke.

The ‘Cats, forced to foul to
stop the clock, fouled Coastal’s
Robert Dowdell with 4.5 seconds
left; he calmly sank both free
throws. Still, the “Cats hadachance
to tie, down 58-55 with the ball and
4.5 seconds to work with. But the
ball was knocked away from Jason
Zimmerman as he tried to get a
three-pointer off, and Davidson fell
to defeat. The ‘Cats 6-13 perform-

ance at the free throw line may
have cost them the game.

Still, it was an incredible ef-
fort. The Wildcats dominated the
conference’s number one team in
the firsthalf, taking acommanding
32-22 lead with 1:20 to play be-
hind 58% shooting. They were
supported by a busload of rowdy
fans who were verbally assaulting
the Coastal Carolina bench with
vulgarity appropriate to the occa-
sion and supporting the “Cats with
unheard-of vehemence.

Their 8-point halftime lead was
erased by a speedy Coastalrun, but
Paul Denmond drilled a three-
pointer with 10:55 left and vaulted
the ‘Cats: back into a 42-39 lead.
From there, it went down to the
wire. A tough jumper by Pat Hol-
loway and a two huge put-backs
from Detlef Musch pulled the ‘Cats
within 56-55 before the disappoint-
ment of the final seconds.

Jason Zimmerman and Detlef
Musch, both 2nd-team All-Big
South selections, led the Wildcats
with 15 points apiece. Musch, who
has now clearly loosed all of the
critics from his back, shota perfect
7-7 from the field and thoroughly
outplayed the Chanticleers’

Davidson baseball returned
to Big South conference play on
Saturday against Augusta _
College with ace Dave Williams

time all year as the Jaguars rolled

game at Wildcat Park.

After falling behind 7-0 after
two and a half innings, Davidson.
rallied to tie the game at 10 in
their half of the seventh inning.
The Jaguars responded with three
runs in the eighth inning off
reliever Andy Paul to clinch a
13-10 victory. Paul took the loss
to fall to one and three on the
year while the'team’s record
dropped to 6-9 (4-6 in pihe Big
South).

In building up their lead,
Augusta knocked Williams for
five solo homers, including three
in a row in their five run second
inning. Augusta’s seventh, °
eighth, and ninth batters had all
five of the homeruns.

- Rick Bender and Joe "
Azzolino put the Cats on the
board in the third with back to

back hits,

The Cats then rallied for
five runs in the sixth and four’
runs in the seventh to even the
game, Again, Azzolino (4-5, 3

The Cats’ hopes for revenge
were doused as Sunday’s
doubleheader was rained out.

In previous action, the
Wildcats split a pair of noncon-__
ference games, topping Belmont
Abbey 10-5 and falling to N.C.
State 12-6 on Wednesday.

Paul picked up his first win
of the season by holding
Belmont Abbey scoreless for
seven innings after giving up five
runs in the first two innings. Paul
also held the Crusaders hitless in
the last five innings.

The 20th ranked Wolfpack
racked up 17 hits off three
Davidson pitchers, handing
freshmen Tim Sobon (0-1) his
first collegiate loss. Davidson
hitters managed only four hits,

but scrapped for six runs, four of .

those coming in the second |
inning.

On the season, Rick Bender
leads the team in batting,
homeruns and RBIs (.379, 3, 17).

Bender is currently in the middle

of an eight game hitting streak.
Additionally, four other Wildcat
hitters are batting over .300.
They are Ralph Isernia (.377),
Jay Dalton (.320), Dan Cotton -
(.308), and Joe Azzolino (.300).
Davidson continues confer-
ence play as they visit Winthrop.
for three games this week.
The Cats return home next
weekend to do battle with James
Madison and | Lafayette.’

Davidson 63 Winthrop 48 (ist
round Big South Tournament)

Davidson’s first visit to tour-
nament play since the 1988 South-
ern Conference Tournament
proved to be a successful one.
Detlef. Musch’s. authoritative 2-
handed jam on the ‘Cats’ first
possession set the tone for the game,
and fine man-to-man defense held
the Eagles to 33% shooting from
the field as theAWildcats cruised to
a 63-48 win and advanced to the
semifinals to meet Coastal Caro-
lina.

Four straight points by senior

‘co-captain Darry Strickland, the

final two on a fierce diving layup,
pushed the ‘Cats to a 20-10 lead
midway through the first half, and
Jeff Chapin’s tip-in with 1:50 left
gave Davidson their biggest lead
of the half. The Wildcats settled
for a 27-18 halftime lead.

Five straight points to open the
second half by Detlef Musch, now
clearly established as an intimidat-
ing presence in the lane, gave the

“Cats their biggest lead to date at
34-22, but by thetimehe picked up
his fourth foul and left the game
with 16:29 left, the complexion of
the game had changed. A 13-4 run
brought the Eagles within 38-35
before the Wildcats responded.

A jumperanda fast break layup
by Pat Holloway were followed by
a Zimmerman runner, a Chapin
tip-in, a Janko Narat pull-up
jumper, and 5 straight from Paul
Denmond. All in all it was a 13-1
tear, and the ‘Cats led 51-36 with
8:28 left. Though Winthrop
scratched to within 55-48 with 2:52
remaining due to horrendous
Davidson foul shooting (12-25 for’
the game), the ‘Cats were never
seriously threatened.

‘Ina balanced scoring effort,
Zimmerman paced the team with
13 points. Narat pitched in with 12
and Musch added 10.

A dedicated crowd comprised
mainly of Athletic Administration
personnel cheered the team to vic-
tory at the Civic Center of Ander-
son, S.C.

Davidson 71 Liberty 67. (OT)

Jason Zimmerman’s 5 straight
points and 4 free throws by Paul
Denmond in the overtime spurred
the “Cats to victory over the Flames,
despite blowing a 16-point first
half lead. The matchup with Lib-
erty, an independent, was
Davidson’s final regular-season
tilt.

A 16-foot jumper and a three-
pointer by Zimmerman early in the
extra session metamorphoseda 60-
58 deficit into a 63-60 Davidson
lead, and the ‘Cats never looked
back. Two from the charity stripe
by Detlef Musch and a layup by
Pat Holloway gave Davidson a67-
62 cushion with just over a minute
remaining, and Denmond’s free
throws provided the final margin.

The Flames fought back from
a 36-25 halftime hole to take the
lead at 49-47 with 4:08 to play, but
a hoop from Zimmerman (13
points) tied it.

A three-pointer and a basket
by Denmond (14 points) gave the
‘Cats leads of 52-51 and 54-53,
anda basket by Holloway sent the
game into overtime tied at 56.
Detlef Musch dominated. the
middle with 20 points and 10
rebounds to lead the Wildcats.

Cheerleaders Spark Wildcat Spirit

By Lee Pennington
Cheerleaders, I thought as I
trudged over to Baker Sports
Complex this past Monday night. I
have to take pictures of cheerlead-

- ers. Dim recollections of high

school girls hopping around in front
of our football team came to me,
and I remembered that there’ are
cheerleaders here at Davidson as
well. Cheerleaders, I thought while
I carded in at Baker.

Thirty minutes later, I walked
out of Baker thinking Cheerlead-

_ ers! Wow! Highschool stereotypes

had been crushed. While speaking
to the Davidson squad, I had been
impressed by their dedication and
perseverance. The team, under the
directionof Jeanette Scire, has had
atough yet rewarding year, and is
anticipating good things to come
out of next year’s commitment.
“We're looking really good,
and that’ Soe an.part,to our size,’

said junior Tina Smith. “The team

is bigger this year. We’ve tried a
lot of new stuff that we haven’t

done before.” 3

Scire feels that the team’s po-

tential is just beginning to be
tapped. However, she also feels
that the student body’s recognition
ofthe squad’ sassets has been slight.
“No one really sees how much
they do and what they accomplish.
They were responsible for the spirit
contest that we had at the last
[basketball] game, and you saw
what kind of turnout we had.”
__. Scireis justifiably proud of her
charges. “We do all the dirty work
for all the sports,” she said with a
smile. “The coaches recognize our
support.” Added junior Katherine
White, “It’s.a lot easier to give
support when you're given sup-
port back.”

Scire plans to capitalize on this
needed supportnextfall. She hopes
to see new additions to the squad
from the class of 1995 as well as
from upperclasmen. The team plans
to recruit a number of male cheer-
leaders to bolster their strength as
a performance squad. “We are

iaoking at a larger coed squad,
which is one reason we invited the
UNCC squad to perform at the last
home game,” said Scire. “We’re
hoping to grab theattention of more
guys.” Scire also wants to organize
adanceé team to perform at halftime
and during timeouts.

' Through support from - the
WildcatClub, plans are being made
for the introduction of new Wild-
catmascotcostumes, which would
be designed by an artist in Califor-
nia. “We’vereceived some designs
which give the mascots more of a

Disney-like appearance,” Scire

noted.

The entire squad expects next
year to be fun as well as challeng-
ing. The cheerleaders plan to con-
tinue their extensive practices in
the hopes of more dynamic rou-
tines, while they also plan to keep
their,job fun. “We don’t try to be
too serious,” said freshman Sarah
Berry. “Youcan’t gooutthere, fall
down, and try to act serious about
it. It’s just fun!”
