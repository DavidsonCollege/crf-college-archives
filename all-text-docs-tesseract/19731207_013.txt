Young Anathematized

Davidson College, Davidson, N

For Heretical Proof

Yesterday the Vatican an-
nounced that John J. Young of
Davidson College’s philosophy
department has been ex-
communicated.

The Pope took this action
following Young’s refusal to
retract an article he wrote for
a philosophy journal. The ar-
ticle purported to prove that
God is a giant prune.

Pope Paul VI in a press con-
ference answered a question
concerning this action by
saying: “I can’t have my
sheep believing that God is a
fruit!”

The response at Davidson
College has been chaotic.
Young told this reporter in a
private interview that he
would never recant. He said:
‘I know God is a prune.

‘‘My proof went something
like this: God created the
world in his image. The earth
is round. God has existed for
all time. Those things in this
world which are old are
wrinkled, for instance, old
people. The Pope tells us that
this world is as evil as the pits
of hell.

‘‘Now, the only thing in this
world which is round,
wrinkled and which has a pit is
a prune. Therefore, we can
conclude beyond a shadow of a
doubt that God is a prune.
Q.E.D.”

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. responded to
this action with a decision that
Young be dismissed im-
mediately.

Spencer said,‘‘I don’t care if
he still claims to be a
Christian, we can’t have
someone teaching at Davidson
who is determined to go to
hell.

“The main reason for the
Christian Commitment, that
is, the reason for all
professors being Christians, is
obvious. The professors are
bound to die before the studen-
ts. If they’re in heaven, they
can hold heaven’s door open
for their students.”’

Spencer believes that Young
would not help his students get

PETER SISTERS

Assistant Director of Student
Affairs Duff Bruce announced
that he has procured the
much-sought Peter Sisters to
perform in the Rathskeller next
week.

The Peter Sisters, Fonda and
her little sister Anita, are
presently touring the East
Coast with the staph of their
magic show.

“Their trickery is bringing
down house after house,”
Bruce said. “They're a very
tight pair.”’

to heaven even though he is an
excellent teacher. He might
even take all his classes to hell
with him.

The Christian Commitment
does not concern itself with
good education but rather with
giving Davidson students a
headstart on heaven, Spencer
felt.

Davidson's religion depart-
ment was lobbying in the
president’s office yesterday.
They demanded that Young be
burned at the stake for his
heresy.

They argued that with the
present fuel shortage, Young’s
burning to death would serve
two purposes. The heat from
the fire could be used to heat
part of Chambers Building.
And God might look more kin-
dly upon Young’s past classes
if he were made to pay for his
crimes against God and
humanity.

Professor of Chemistry

James M._ Frederickson
favored a different form of
death so that Young's body
could be studied to see if some
chemical imbalance had
caused his heretical views.

The psychology department
was in favor of keeping him
alive. They wanted to perform
classical conditioning ex-
periments with Young.

One member of the depart-
ment exploded ecstatically:
‘“‘We’ve never had a human
subject to practice on. We
think J.J. would be perfect for
the position since, as a heretic,
he can’t be trusted to do
anything.”’

Spencer would not comment
on which, if any, of these
proposals he would accept. He
was adamant, however, that
Young be dealt with.

He said, ‘‘We cannot afford
to have a biased professor on
this campus!”’

Jeff George presents format of the '73-'74 yearbook. This ex-
citing format promises to be a real beaut.

Frigid Chambers Chill Profs:

(Ed Note: Is a cold shoulder
worse than a cold room? Is the
lack-of-heat issue a_ hot
potato? Several members of
the Faculty think so, and con-
tracted THE DAVIDSONIAN
to cut through the red tape and
cold air. This is the third of a
two-part series dealing with
this problem. The first in-
stallment will be printed
sometime in the future.)

The nation-wide energy
crisis and fuel shortage struck
again at. this placid college
community causing an in-
crease in sluggishness, book-
burning, and bundling.

The latest appearance of the
Shivering syndrome has at-
tacked the faculty, who com-
plain that their offices are
becoming increasingly colder.

After a diligent search of
Chambers this correspondent
finally discovered an occupied
office, whose professor was
shaking either with rage or the
dread disease. His warm
welcome could not temper the
cold office.

Director of Physical Plant
Grover C. Meetze commented,
“We have to conserve fuel
somewhere, and professors
are so seldom in their offices
we didn’t think they would
mind.

“The heat was turned off
three weeks ago. lt was sim-
ply a matter of flicking a swit-
ch here and turning a valve
there.”

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. said, ‘‘Me too.”’
Professor of Philosophy
Earl MacCormac logically
deduced that since his office
was colder and the window

was Closed, that the heat must
have been turned off.
‘Somebody did it,’’ said Mac-
Cormac, noting that heating
was an administrative, not a
faculty responsibility.

Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David
Cornell, in a short interview in
the heated garage attached to
his office explained, ‘‘Now
don’t think this has anything
to do with the Governance
situation. Just because the
faculty are so stubborn.... If
there wasn't a fuel shortage
we would not have done it.”’

Faculty spokesman Alexan-
der McKelway outlined his
strategy. ‘‘Right now we're
not trying to get the heat tur-
ned on as much as the air con-
ditioning turned off.”

McKelway also suggested, if
fuel was so scarce, that the
college resume cutting peat
from the college peat bog.
“You know, the one where the
new dorms are not going to be
built.”’

Professor of Physics Robert
Manning prophesied, ‘‘It’s a
matter of entropy. The world
is old, and is being run down.
The comet Kohoutek is a sign.
Some of us will be as warm as
toast soon. Sooner than you
think.”’

Dean of Students Will Terry
rebutted the faculty com-
plaints saying ‘‘It is the kind of
forthright decision that the
Davidson College ad-
ministration has always made
for the future satisfaction and
gratification of all involved.

“The faculty will be able to
say with some degree of pride
that ‘they did their part’ to
ease the energy crisis. And af-
ter all, that’s what Davidson is
all about, giving generously of
oneself for the happiness and
comfort of others.”’

Meanwhile, the students,
odd man out in Governance,
are stoicly studying Seneca
and burning the couplets of
Alexander Pope for warmth.

Quoth one second-year
Humanities student, warming
his hands over a dying fire,
‘‘What ever is, is best.’

Lame Duck Student Body
President Bo Phillips, in his
last official quote, said,
‘Despite the fact that some of
my best friends are on the
Davidson faculty and I hate to
see them suffer, sacrifices on
their part are necessary. After
all students have suffered cold
shoulders for years from
faculty members who insist
that students have no right

making decisions
Educational Policy.”’

But most students, blissfully
unaware of the _ bitter
magnitude of the crisis, were
calm. One freshman co-ed
commented on the lack of heat
in the faculty offices, ‘‘It’s a
small sacrifice for them, and I
don’t think it's too great a har-
dship. They are a hardy bunch
- they ll survive.”’

Yet the Faculty is adamant
in their stand to ‘turn the heat
on.’ One professor who
wished to remain anonymous,
said, ‘‘This’ isn’t an
ultimatum, but if the
negotiations on the 60 yard
line of Sprunt Field are not
satisfactory we'll be forced

Lawrimore Receives

1973 Pullit Surprise

News sources announced
this week that Director of
the News Bureau Buck
Lawrimore has been awarded
this year’s Pullit Surprise for
his outstanding contributions
to literature.

The Surprise was formally
awarded yesterday by
Professor of Philosophy Ear]
MacCormac, the campus
representative for ‘Pullit
Now,’ the nationally-known
literary syndicate.

When asked if he approved
of Pulit’s selection of
Lawrimore, MacCormac an-
swered, ‘‘Yea.”’

However, despite Mac-
Cormac’s approval, much
hullabaloo followed the an-
nouncement. Telegrams from
all over the country flooded
Davidson’s mail room this

morning. ‘“‘Who the hell is
Buck Lawrimore?’’, many
querried.

Nevertheless, MacCormac
remained adamant. ‘‘I’m
right, I’m right, I know I’m
right,”’ he said.

According to MacCormac,
Lawrimore was selected for
his screenplay adaptation of
an earlier novel, ‘‘Back Door
Barney”. The film will star
Lawrimore himself and a Ger-
man

At a reception this morning,
Lawrimore answered
questions and kissed babies of
well-wishers. ‘‘Aren’t you sur-
prised?’’ he commented.

Lawrimore is currently at
work on his second novel,
a poignant story of his pet ass
“Odie”. The book is ten-
tatively titled ‘Donkey Odie.”
