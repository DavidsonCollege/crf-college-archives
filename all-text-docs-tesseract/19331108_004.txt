Fortune Magazine Tells
Story of Cannon’s Rise

Famous Magazine Has Article on
the Rise to Prominence of
C. A. Cannon, Class 1915

A very interesting article appeared
in the November issue of the Fortune
magazine concerning the history of
the Cannon Towel Mills and a run-
ning sketch of the life of Mr. Charles
A. Cannon, '15, who is president of
the mills. Along with this article was
a similar article relating to the rise
of the elder Cannon to prominence in
the manufacturing and financial world.

Fortune gives the World War as the
break that started Mr. Cannon on the
road to higher success. Before the
war, bath towels were used sparingly,
but when the war came and took all
the hand towels, the people were
forced to use something else, Flour
sacks were out of the question as the
war took most of them; this left the
only alternative—bath The
American people began to realize that
bath towels were far superior to ordi-
towels, drank
lip more water, and due to this fact,
coupled with their softness, they rap-
idly became popular. Fortune says
that the to’el question finally becaine
merely a Question between Mr. Charles
A. Cannon and the American people.

At present Cannon Mills manufac-
ture-more than half of all the towels
in the United States., They have de-

almost every towel that
bought. It is an inoffensive looking
gun sitting on the name “Cannon.”
\iter a satisfactory machine for the
sewing this trademark each

to determine a Cannon towel.

When the

war was over there were
too many towels. Therefore the towel
decreased and Mr. Cannon
realized that something had to be done
in order to keep the business going.

He finally arrived. at the conclusion
that style was lacking in towels, He
called on Miss Virginia Hamill for

help and she came with many sugges-
tions. But at the first the majority of
her ideas were thought to be expen-
they would necessitate
the installation of many new machines,
-Miss Hamill thought that towels
should be full of color, carry futuristic
designs and many polka dots. Mr.
Cannon agreed with her and they com-
promised by border
So the first
of the fancy Cannon towels were man-
ufactured, coming forth in colors of
green, pink, and other pastel shades.
Two or three years passed and Mr.
Cannon tinally decided that Miss Ham-
ill’ original suggestions were good, so
once more the towel industry was rey-
olutionized. Towels were made with
polka dots, triangles, arrowheads, and
in colors to match with “ Crane.Plum-
