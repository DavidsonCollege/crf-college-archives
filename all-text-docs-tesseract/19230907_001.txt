PRESIDENT MARTIN
WELCOMES NEW STUDENTS

AND NEW PROFESSORS |

It is a pleasure to extend a cordial wel-
come to the students—old and new—of Da-
vidson, as they take up the work and re-
sponsibilities of the new session, I trust that |
your year may be so satisfactory that each |
one of you may look back upon it at its close |
with unalloyed pleasure and pride.

To this end I pledge you all the resources
of the institution, all the service and good-
will of teachers and officers, and the prayers

parents and a host of loyal lovers of
Davidson boys.

Remember, however, that success depends
primarily upon you. You can easily throw
your chances of success to the winds, but if
you are determined to succeed and give your
best to that end, all other forces will find it
hard and difficult to bring about your de-
feat. The rather, when it is known that you
“dead in earnest,” the great majority of
all influences will be found decidedly in your
favor,

are

All the teachers of last year, with three
exceptions, will be back to guide you in your
work. Mr. Wagner, of public speaking and
debate, does not return, To succeed him, Mr.
Fred L, Dendy, of Alabama, comes to join
our forces, As a student in three universi-
ties and a teacher of considerable experience,
he comes to us with excellent recommenda-
tions. Mr: L. M. Currie is on leave for one
year to do graduate work at Cornell Uni-
versity. Mr. W. M. Mebane, of Virginia,
takes Mr. Currie’s place in the Physics de-
partment, and Mr. C. K. Brown, of North
Carolina, does his work in the Mathematical
department. Both are Davidson meh, Mr.
Brown is a Master of Arts of the University
of North Carolina, and Mr, Mebane has his
Bachelor Degree from the Virginia Poly-
technic Institute. Mr. F. L. Blythe comes
to help in-Spanish. He is also a Davidson
graduate, a Master of the University of
North Carolina, with a,number of courses
in other universities, has had quite a good
deal of teaching experience in school and
college and has been spending the. passed
summer in Spain in study and travel.

Captain Wetherby, of the R. O. T. C.
Department, has completed his work in this
line and is ordered to Panama by the War
Department. Capt. George H. Weems, of
the Infantry, with large experience in this
country and overseas, takes his place.

Mr. Jno. P. Williams, 1916, comes to us
as Y. M. C. A. secretary, taking the place
of Mr. A. L. Currie, who made such a mark-
ed success last session. Those who knew
Mr. Williams as a student and especially as
the Student Body President, will expect him
to prove his ability to do the work called
for. He was noted for his interest in col-
lege, activities and his organizing power.
We will give him and his family a cordial
welcome as we do to all the new instructors.

The old students will recognize a number
of campus improvements. We have not
done all we had hoped to do, but have done
as much as we had time for.

Much grading has been done around the
new heating plant, and the new dormitories.
The new Watts Hall (dormitory) ap-
proaches completion.- The work has been

_ pushed as fast as it should have been, but it

\,,is physically impossible to complete it. by
‘the opening of college and do the work
weil. I am sure all the students will join
in making the men who are to room in New
Watts comfortable until they can get into
their own building. It is hoped that two
floors Will be Yeady at the opening and the
other two floors will be tees in SOE
hwo seeks,

The Richardson Athletic Field is expected
‘to be ready for use by the opening. I ven-
jture to predict that every one will be pleased
with this improvement. .If it serves as well
as it promises to I doubt if there is a better
college athletic field in the South.
| ¢l give you every one a cordial welcome ;
\1 offer you my utmost personal service; “I
urge you*to do your best the year through,
| and I wish for you a year of great satisfac-
lien and of a happy life.

Wm. J. Martin,
President.

GREETINGS FROM THE “Y”

A GOOD YEAR IN PROSPECT
Atlanta, 28, 1923.

Well, fellows, just a few more days until
we assemble at Old Davidson to take up our
college work, and I suppose every heart
quickens with joy at the thought of it. Of
course we hate to leave Mother, and Mary,
or Dot, or whatever her name may be, and
the car and: all that goes to make Bingville
our home, but we'll appreciate them more
when we return, And then we shall have a
grand time at Davidson, for there we
are all good friends: there are no factions

Ga., Aug.

too,

and everybody loves everybody else.

Now, as we approach the opening day, the
Young Men's Christian Association greets
you and desires to extend to you a most
cordial weleome to “The Hill.” To those
who have never been with us before we
want to extend a special welcome. You will
find upon your arrival not a lot of bullies
waiting to intimidate and embarrass you be-
cause you are green, but a bunch of big
brothers to help you in every way. Even
the light hazing that existed at Davidson for
many years has been voted out by the stu-
dents. We want you to feel that the “Y”
is your personal friend to help you in any
difficulty. We shall have a reception com-
mittee to meet you at the train and show
you_around, helping you to arrange your
jcourse, A copy of the “Y” Handbook will
| be given you, and on Monday night will be
the annual Freshman Reception given by the
Y. M. C. A.

Upon enrollment as a student at Davidson
you become a member of the “Y"; always
lconsider yourself a part of it and attend the
weekly Vesper service on Sunday evenings.
The first service will be one of welcome to
you. Don't miss it.

The purpose of the Y. M. C. A. is pri-
marily to lead men to Jesus’ Christ and to
keep them in fellowship with Him. In ad-
dition we try to provide all possible forms
of amusement for the students. Our pro-
gram includes a weekly picture show on
Saturday nights, at which we run only the
{best and latest films at a very reasonable
|price to cover expenses.

The “Y” also cordially greets the old men
who are returning. We have lost a fine
group of men in the class of '23, and it is
up to you to fill their places even better
than they did. We are sure you will co-
operate with all organizations on the Hill to
make a “Bigger and a Better Davidson.”
The “Y’’ needs you and you need the “Y,”
so fall in and give your best.

Yours for Old Davidson,
W. Ted Jones,
President of the “Y”.

DAMAGE FEE REGULATIONS

a deposit of $2.00 to cover miscellaneous

of his room it is repaired and bill is sent
out and it is expected that the student will
pay this, leaving the original $2.00 to be re-
