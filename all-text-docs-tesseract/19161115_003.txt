DR. McGEACHY SPEAKS
AT Y. M.C. A. MEETING

Dr. A. A. McGeachy, of Charlotte,
spoke at the Y. M. C. A. meeting last
Phursday, his subject being “The Tow-
er of Babel.” “The life here in college
was shown to be a. preparation for the
life hereafter. tdeas and impressions
made now will be retained thruout the
rest of the livelier career. Every one
ought. to live for the common good in-
stead of for selfish ends. Instead of
working merely for self, one should be
more useful. “Vhe greatest problem to-
dav building moral architecture.
When the ancients tried te build the
‘Tower of Babel they failed because they
tid not uve the proper material. “This
ss aowarning that itis impossible to build
omethiag tmoerishable out of something
yerishable. Something that will last
cannot be built of brick and slime. Stone
‘s needed for such building. “The perman-
ency of what is built depends oa what
‘s put into it. Good character is one of
the essentials in building up something
that will last. Christ in) choosing His
Aisciples chose those that He knew were
stone, One of the main reasons that the
old “Vower of Babel was not. finished
was on account of the confounding of
languages. It is the same wav today.
People showd understand each — other
better, Words will not tell the truth.
Something is needed so that cach one
will be understood by the other, Work
is better understood than words. Work-
ing for self crowds out working for

Is

others. More moral enthusiasm is need
ed. A man will never build anything
unless he loses himself in helping others.

The old Vower of Babel was not fin-
ished because the builders were not
hutlding for the right purpose, and the
people of today will not succeed unless
they build on Calvary and in the name
of Jesus Christ,

At the Y. M. C. A. meeting tomorrow
night at 7 o'clock the speaker will he
Rev. Mr. Erwin, pastor of the local
Methodist church. ‘This will be the
first time that Mr. Erwin has address-
ed the students, and all of the members
of the Student Body are requested and
urged to be present.

Price

15.

Ace from the price feature, which is of course, our
strongest bid for your patronage, the ability to clothe
young men—and particularly college men—with the
style Suits and Overcoats they revel in, is the most ap.
pealing attribute of this shop.

We know what the young fellows like to wear, we
know their tastes—their ideas of style—and we know
what hard service their clothes are usually put to.

Our prices are the same, year in and year out, and
in addition to the style and service obtained in these
clothes, you have the satisfaction of saving, at least, a
five dollar bill on every purchase.

We solicit the patronage of the boys of Davidson
College, and promise in return more

" than value received.
