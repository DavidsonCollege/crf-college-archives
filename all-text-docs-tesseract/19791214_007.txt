Davidson spread the point
total over almost the entire
bench last night in as 83-64
victory over Eckerd to up the
record to 4-2. Rich Wilson and
Todd Haynes were the top
scorers in the effort while Jamie
Hall snatched down 12 re-
bounds. The team as a whole
shot 57% from the floor, 65% in
the first half, which provided a
spark of offense that could have
been used in other games.
Rich DiBenedetto, David-
son’s leading scorer and the
prime figure in Davidson’s
offense thus far, was out of last
night’s game because of an
illness. Coach Eddie Bieden-
bach took this opportunity to
allow his entire team to sée a
great deal of action.
“Sometimes along the way,”
Biedenbach said, “‘we’re going
to have to play without some-
body and not suffer. Tonight we
just let everybody play for us to
see how much they could con-
tribute. I’m very pleased with
the game, but our defense is
still not good enough.”
Although DiBenedetto miss-
ed this game, he received two
awards during the week for his
effort in the first five games. He
was named Southern Confer-
ence Player of the Week and
also received the Most Valuable

. Player Award in the First

Union Invitational. .

Southern Conference oppo-
nents Furman and Marshall
come up back to back this
coming week and are important
to see if Davidson has a chance
to get into the upper level of the
Southern Conference. The Fur-
man game is Saturday night in
Charlotte With a 7:30 p. m.
tip-off. The Marshall game is on
the road Monday night.

Baylor is the next opponent

The Davidson Wildcattes
played their first divisional
game Tuesday night against
Methodist College but the
Cattes lost, 64-44. This was the
fifth game of the season for
Methodist, but only Davidson’s
second.

In the first half the two teams
had identical shooting percent
ages, 42%, and although
Davidson was never at the line,
they were only behind by one at
halftime, 31-30. In the second
half Methodist slowly pulled
away although they didn’t blow
open the score until the last 4
minutes when they ran fast
break after fast break.

The leading scorer for David-
son was guard Mitzi Short who
had 12 points. Also for David-
son, Carol. Heppner and Anna
Hutchinson both had 6 points,
Jeanne Womack had 4 points
and Mike Frankhouser and
Sarah Womack.had 8 each. The
Cattes never went to the foul

The Cattes picked up a win,
however, when the Owls: of
Warren Wilson came to David-
son Tuesday night and were
devoured by the Cattes, 64-45.

the Cats and waltzed to a 104-82
win, There were numerous rea-
sons for theloss such as superb
shooting by UNC-C (36 for 40 at
the foul line) and relatively poor

shooting by Davidson.

Biedenbach pointed to the
transition defense as being one
of the main’ problems. He said
the team was not recovering
quick enough after missed shots
and turnovers to provide an
adequate defense against a run-
ning and talented team like
UNC-C. - - i

SC foe Western Carolina also
took advantage of the transition
defense as well as other David-
son mistakes to hand ere
what Biedenbach ‘called ‘

disappointing losses. I’ve ever
had.”’ Western Carolina won
74-62, Three Davidson starters
personified the outside shooting
problem facing the Cats. Hall/
went 1-8 from the field, John
Carroll went 1-7, and Ernie
Reigel went 1-4.

“We have some good ania
ers,’’ Biedenbach said, “but:
we have to be more selective i in”
our shots. We have to be more
aggressive in our offensive play,
Our defensive effort is better,
but we have too far to go.”
