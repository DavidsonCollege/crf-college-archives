Concept Of Honor

Our editorial last week urging that
students be allowed to attend services
at any church in lieu of vespers at
the College Church has prompted re-
sponses from a number of concerned
students. Inevitably, they say: “It's
fine here in town, but it won't work if
you get out of this vicinity. It'll put
too great a strain on the Honor Sys-
tem.”

Balderdash.

An honor system is based on the
asssumption that the majority of
those living under it are honorable
men. If such an assumption is false,
we may as well forget an honor sys-
tem. However, if such an assumption
is true (and we believe it is at David-
son), then: we have the base for an
honor system..

False is the tdea advanced that the
Honor System loses significance as
the distance between the student and
‘the College increases. The person ad-
vancing such an argument is not
speaking of an honor system: rather
he has in mind a system of fear and
intimidation, overshadowed by the
“axe.”

_ When the student leaves the Col-
lege, he escapes the reach of the
“axe.” But on the other hand, when
the College and student are separat-

ed, the strength of an Honor Code
does not diminish, for the basis of the
system lies in the moral fiber of the
individual. No matter where the indi-
vidual goes, the concept of honor is
always with him.

We have always thought that the
system at Davidson was one based on
personal honor. If our understanding
of the Davidson system is incorrect,
if the system is in actuality based on
threats of punishment, then we should
Stop dignifying it with such a respect-
ed name as “Honor Code,” we must
acknowledge its foundation as one of
fear of punishment.

However, if we are to consider our
code a system of honor, then we must
be willing to put our faith in the hon-
esty on the part of the vast majority
of our fellow students. This is the con-
cept Davidson has nurtured through
the years; this is the concept David-
son should continue to nurture.

And one last. remark—Let us cease
this contradictory chatter of “strain-
ing” the Honor System. A man may
live by a system of honor; or a man
may violate a system of honor. But
never does a man “strain” a system
of honor. The concept is self-contra-

dictory. CLD

The Oath In Committee

in February the trustees approved
a greatly modified faculty oath. Yes-
terday, to comply with their regula-
tion that charter changes be approved
at two consecutive meetings, the trus-
tees were expected to “rubber stamp”
their February action. They didn’t.

Normally, the faculy would howl,
the newspaper would howl, and per-
haps even some trustees would howl.
But the action yesterday referring the
oath back to the Education Committee
was not a “referral to committee” in
the American sense of the phrase
“pigeonhole.” Rather it was a sincere
attempt to arrive at a more accept-

able solution to the oath issue than
the February decision.

Trustee President J. McDowell Rich-
ards indicated that the discussion be-
“ween several trustees and about a
dozen faculty members Wednesday
night influenced his thinking on the.
subject. We are delighted that the ses-
sion was a boon, arid we are confident
that further consultation between
trustee and faculty will lead to a solu-
tion from the trustees which will be
better received than the February ac-
tion.

‘Beyond The Academic’

Professor Bradley D. Thompson
would not have wanted a eulogy. And
he slashed enough platitudes from
enough papers that to be even slightly
platitudinous would be a discredit to
his memory.

This was his method. He was not a
flashy lecturer or a classroom per-
former. But he had the scrutinizing

eye of a true scholar and one of the
keenest, quickest, most perceptive
minds I have ever encountered. If I
remember anything from my four
years at Davidson, I will remember
the evenings we spent in his home,
poring over documents of early Eng-
lish history, piecing together primary
sources, quietly marveling as he cor-
rected the mistakes in our translated
‘versions from his Latin text.

_I will remember the feeling he in-
fused into English constitutional his-
tory, the meaning he could squeeze
out of dry, dessicated facts, and, above
all, his warm response to a bright ob-
servation. He always seemed to enjoy
his work, but he would respond best,
teach best, when you yourself, the
Student, were at your best. And he
gave the finest reward a student can
have, the professor’s appreciation of
his ideas.

Professor Thompson detested “soft”
thinking. He had little patience for
the student who began sentences with
unsupported subjects of the “I feel”
variety. He seldom asked for the nar-
rative recounting of facts. In a three-
hour lecture course, he was teaching

a way of looking at history, critical
analysis, sensitive thinking.

This was why Brad Thompson never
cared to cover all the material in his
lectures, and it is also probably why
he opposed comprehensive examina-
tions. The student who understood
Prof. Thompson’s purposes in teach-
ing found his classes much more than
just another history course and gained
from him a new understanding of
scholarship.

Professor Brad Thompson's contri-
bution was the unheralded one. Few
really know how much he did to es-
tablish the Richardson Scholarship
program as one of the best-adminis-
tered foreign student programs in the
nation. He did a solid job in every-
thing. with never-ending devotion for

etail.

_ Looking back over four years at Da-
vidson, I realize that a great part of
the Davidson education is simply the
men who give it to you, their integ-
rity, their concern, their value pat-
terns. Prof. Brad Thompson was one
of those professors whom it was ex-
perience merely to study under.

His influence reached beyond the
academic. I will probably remember
longer than English constitutional his-
tory Brad Thompson’s great personal
and scholarly integrity, his solid hon-
esty, his simple dignity.

Professor Bradley D. Thompson
touched the lives of uncounted. stu.
dents. His inspiration lives on in

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Liberal Vespers Policy
Blasted As ‘impractical’

Littrell

Dear Editor:

I would like to suggest with
regard to your editorial, ‘‘Ves-
pers Revisited,” of May 8 that
your opinions are in some cases
impractical, and in others irra-
tional.

First let us examine the prac.
tical aspects of your statement.
I gather that it is your opinion
that a system of (almost) com-
plete freedom should be institut-
ed by the college in the matter
of church attendance .. .

The problem of a ‘‘forced”
and therefore ‘antagonistic’ re-
ligion is not- eliminated, but
made only slightly more ‘‘op-
tional.”

In addition, your proposed re
vamp would create very defi-
nite problems for the Davidson
Honor Code. Specifically, the sys-
tem creates yet another tempta-
tion for the student. If. as you
suggest, the ‘‘average’’ student
thinks of Vespers as a ‘‘mock-
ery,”’ then it follows that there
would exist a tremendous temp.
tation to oppose this ‘'rnockery™
by ignoring it. This. despite the
traditional honor of the David.
son Gentleman, would be espe-
cially true if the student were
divorced from the Davidson
community both by distance and
by fellowship.

The second problem which 1
see in your editorial {s involved
in your statement to the cffect
that “. . . only a cvnic weld
dare label the episode (of Ves.
pers) ‘spiritually moving’:’
Cynical in itself, the statement
can in no way aid iw the elimi
nation of the problem. There Is,
T admit, a problem. However, it
involves more the Vespers con-
gregation than. the institution of
Vespers itself. The ‘ideal of
community worship’’ which you
seem to feel is being sought ts
in fact a myth—perpetrated only
by our ignorance, and our fail-
ure to respond.

We must hold ourselves re-
sponsible. Worship of ‘any kind
becomes ‘'. . . a mockery of re-
ligion - . .” only when the par-
ticipants themselves are mock-
ers; Vespers becomes “’. . . the
most entertaining hour of the
week . . .”’ only when the con-
gregation is seeking entertain-
ment.

A religious service becomes
meaningful only when one de-
sires more from it than a

“farce.” This is true no matter -

how the Administration chooses
to regulate attendance at relig-
jous functions. We too have a
responsibility—to ourselves if to
no one else; before we can rea-
sonably hope for college under.
Standing, we must meet this re-
sponsibility.

Dear Editor:

From time to time I have ob-
served casually but with consid-
erable respect the service ren-
dered by members of Alpha Phi
Omega, the national service fra-
ternity. Last week I observed it
fairly intimately, when Alpha
Phi Omega helped extensively
with registration for the meet-
ing of the North Carolina Acad-
emy of Science. To the best of
my knowledge, most of the
members who helped with the

registration had no direct in-
volvement with science: yet
they helped just the same. For
their voluntary service they
have my sincere gratitude and
respect.

Dear Editor:

The recent outrage on the
part. of the ROTC department
was. highly uncalled for since it
interfered with the performance
of David Richey's string quar-
tet in the Fine Arts Building.
Perhaps the ROTC department
could do a better Job of schedul-
ing next time.

Before leaving Davidson I
would like to make clear my
feelings about the college and
the criticism I have occasion-
ally voiced in this column. I
do not want to leave the im-
pression that my letters were
the efforts of a misguided stud-
ent attempting to undermine
the institution.

My letters were the expression
of a very deep love for David-
son and for the individuals who
make het life possible. Our
lives here are deeply affected
by associations from janitors to
the president. Every act on this
campus is felt by these individ-
uals: we are all emotionally
bound to this undefined object
we call Davidson. All of us
work within our spheres here in
an effort to add our mite of
wisdom to this object we love
so much.

Criticism in such a context is
inevitably taken personally. It
is this aspect of my thoughts

which I would like to make

clear. It often is very difficult

to question the actions taken
by individuals without creating
the feeling that the critic is at-
tacking the individual persona)-
ly. I have tried to maintain
the painfully thin line between
constructive criticism and per-
sonal attack. Where I have
failed I am sorry.

1 cealize that most of my
letters were neither needed nor
heeded. My purpose was not
to provide any answers but
to raise questions. My feel-
ings like those of every indiv-
idual change from day to day.

If my thoughts have served to
disturb the waters of minds on
this campus then they have
succeeded in their purpose.

Seoregationist Finds
Northern Supporters

By SEABORN JONES

In this season of presidential primaries something a
little out of the ordinary is taking place. This ‘“‘some-
thing,” of coprse, is the appearance of Alabama’s Demo-
cratic, but states-rightist and segregationist, Governor
George C. Wallace on the scene.

I do not mean to praise Wal-
lace personally in this article,
but Ido believe his showings in
Wisconsin and Indiana deserve
some comment.

President Johnson chose not
to have his name entered in
either the Wisconsin or Indiana
primaries and left the supposed-
ly routine task of securing for
him the two states’ convention
votes up to the Democratic gov-
ernors (both Johnson support-
ers) of the two states. Neither
Johnson nor Governor Reynolds
of Wisconsin nor Welsh of Indi-
ana counted on Wallace.

In Wisconsin, a month ago.
Wallace rolled up a total of
264,000 votes after Governor
Reynolds had stated that if the
Alabama Governor got as many
as 100,000 votes ft ‘‘would be a
catastrophe.”” In Indiana last
week Wallace grabbed off near-
ly thirty per cent of the votes
cast in the Democratic primary
and probably carried the cities
of Gary and Hammond.

Exactty what does this
prove? Liberal Democrats in
both states are quick to at-
tribute much.of Wallace’s suc-
cess to Republican cross-ov-
ers, but Wisconsin’s Governor
Reynolds probably came near-
er to the truth when he said,
“All that Mr. Wallece has
demonstrated is whet we've
known all along. We have a
tot of people who are preju-
diced.”

Undoubtedly, many of those
who voted for Governor Wal-
lace did so because of. racial

prejudice, but I believe that a
substantial amount of his sup-
port came from people sincere-
ly opposed to the pending Civil
Rights Bill (or portions there.
of).

Watlace’s avowed purpose in
running In these primaries has
been to give the Democratic
voters a chance to register
their displeasure concerning
the bill. tn Indiana he sald,
“You have a good opportunity
to kill the bill by voting for
me,”

I personally do not think that
the Civil Rights Bill will or
ought to be ‘killed’, but I do
think that the measure of suc-
cess Wallace has attained in
Wisconsin and Indiana _ should
cause the Senate to at least seri-
ously consider modification of
certain sections of the bill.

tt seems fo me that the opin-
tons of a considerable numb-
ber of people as registered by
their votes in the presidential
primaries of Wisconsin and
Indiana should carry as much
weight as civil rights demon-
strations and the threat of
more of the same.

Northern liberals really ought
to be thankful that they only
had to contend with Wallace—a
man who at best has a bad
“image. As Time magazine
noted in its April 17th fssue,

‘what might have happened if .

a man with a ‘good image’—
Virginia's Harry Byrd, for ex-
ample, or Georgia's Dick Rus-
sell—had run in Wisconsin and
Indiana instead?”

"64 ‘Quips And Cranks’:
Reviewer Disappointed

By JOHN B. McCLATCHEY

The 1964 Quips and Cranks has resulted in a disappointment for me. Assum-
ing there is at least a modicum of creative talent, it shows a marked lack of imag-
ination and, in my opinion, reveals a deficiency of staff work and perseverance.

In the field of photography
there seems to have been some
ability existent; however, in the
spaciousness and forced crea-
tiveness -of the introductory
pages any chance for aesthetic
appeal is lost in expanses of
blank white paper. These spots
could have been much more ef-
fectively used by art or pictures
than by the copy editor's explor-
ations of Eastern philosophy
and his conglomeration of ‘‘po-
etry.”

The layout as a whole reach-
es, at points, peaks of strained
adequacy. The sections them-
selves are very like those of the
run-of-the-mill high school pub-
lication. This only shows the in-
ability of the students to choose
the best creative talent to lead

the staff.

If there is a saving grace, it
must be the excellent photo-
graphic work in the introduc-
tion and division pages. What-
ever aesthetic or stimulating ef-
fect this achieves is demolished
by the copy. As soon as one
tries to read the poems aloud,
he is struck by the tongue-twist-
ing impossibility of such an un-
dertaking. The meter and mean-
ing are not readily apparent to
me. They seem to be lost in
euphemistic attempts at senti-
ment, which is not actually pres-
ent in the thoughts of the stu-
dents.

The division pages appealed
to my sense of aesthetics. They
were used very effectively in
presenting the season as a

theme: and again the photog-
raphy added a good deal.

The number of pages devoted
to each section is rather strange.
Admittedly Davidson was able
to field an extremely good bas-
ketball team. but this does not
justify the allotment of almost.
as many pages to the athletic
section as to the activities sec-
tion. From this we could infer
that athletics are as important
as all other school sanctioned
activities combined.

Stephen Crane has an interest-
ing thought in his contribution
to the annual. He says in a tone
of defeat, ‘Doubtless there are
other roads.’ I hope the staff
searched for some of the more
interesting roads, but I ‘think
they chose the wrong one.

‘There Is Going To Be Violence’

By JOE HOWELL

Last Monday a civil rights speaker was met with a rather harsh reaction by a large number of Davidson stu
dents. Granted, his aggressive tone and critical attitude concerning the South were not appealing. Granted, he
spoke in emotional generalizations and challenged white liberals to speak out.

Granted, he drove im one
point: ‘'. . . the reason for the
militancy movement in the Ne-
gro community today is the lack
of responsibility of white liber-
als.

“If you don't become invoived
there is going to be violence
. .° Hill's message was met
with whistles, laughs and cyn-
ical applause.

Before we write Herbert Hill
off as one who does not know
what he is talking about, we
might look over his record. In
his role of labor secretary for
the NAACP, he travels through.
out most of the fifty states each
year.

After leaving Davidson, he
went directly to Detroit where
he had a conference with the
president of General Motors Cor.
poration concerning their hiring
policies. From Detroit, Hill is to
‘go to Berkeley, Calif., where
he is keynote speaker for a con-
ference in the graduate school of
political science concerning the
racial crisis.

During the afternoon, he re-
ceived Jong distance telephone
calls from a civil rights leader
in Chicago, a labor leader in
New York, and ABC-TV, asking
him to appear on a_ network
broadcast.

Hill has graduate degrees in
history and economics from
NYU, and besides being a full
professor at the new school of
Social Research in New York.
he has lectured recently at such
schools as Harvard, Princeton.
MIT, Yale, Columbia, UCLA,
Berkeley, and the University of
Chicago. In the South, he has
been to Emory, Vanderbilt, and
Duke.

Hill has made many reports to
congressional committees con-
cerning the Negro economic sit-
uation, has written three books
and numerous articles, and has
served as special consultant to
the United Nations Conference
on Eradication of Discrimina-
tion.

For many, Hill's delivery left
something to be desired, but
there is one thing he did do. He
expressed the feelings of de-
spair and frustration that so
many people in the civil rights
struggle today feel. He spoke in
a tone of urgency and issued a
challenge. He did’ not try to be
a good guy or present a digni-
fied image, for like so many
leaders in the Negro movement,
Hill is fed up with trying to
maintain an image. When he
made an emotional plea for our
support, he was not simply be-

ing dramatic.

The fact is, whether we think
he is right or not, the present
leaders in the civil rights strug-
gle have almost reached the
breaking point. For twenty years
Hill has been involved in a
struggle which now, from his
point of view, seems to be at a
standstill. The Negro unemploy-
ment rate is almost four times
greater than that of the white
and is not being diminished.

Only one per cent of the South-
ern schools have been desegre-
gated since 1954. More and more
Negroes are losing faith in men
like King. Roy Wilkins and
James Farmer and are joining
the Black Muslim movement.
More and more Negroes are
tired of waiting and are tired of
white promises. Hill more than
anything else wanted to impart
this sense of despair and frus-
tration. Our response was one
of ridicule and hostility.

Perhaps Hill needs more
faith. Perhaps more faith and
patience is what is needed on
the part of the entire Negro
community. After all ‘300 years
is but a tick on eternity’s
clock.** Yet. listening to Mr. Hill:
and hearing of the times he and
his colleagues have been spit
upon, have been thrown in jail,
have been promised concessions

which were never granted, I
can't help wondering what I
would do in his position. I can't
help asking myself how much
a human being can endure.

When Mr. Hill left Davidson
he was very disappointed.
“Don't they believe me?" he
said. ‘‘Don't they understand the
critical time we are in?” He
sadly ‘mentioned he had never
talked with a group of more un-
informed students anywhere in
his twenty years of work in col-
leges and universities all over
the country. He was appalled by
the lack of concern, the hostility,
the lack of understanding of the
situation. He could not under-
Stand why people reacted the
way they did.

Sure, it was because of his
attitude and his delivery. Sure,
he Is expecting too much from
Southern college students.
Sure, he should have been dip-
lomatic and should have met
us on our level. The sad fact
Is that neither Hill nor the
other leaders in the Negro
struggle are any longer will-
ing to meet us on our ground.
We don’t like this. It Is very
frightening and does not pre-
sent a very happy future.

Hill came here making a final
plea. He is desperate.
We gave him an answer.
