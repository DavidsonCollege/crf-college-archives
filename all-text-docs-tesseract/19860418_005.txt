Former economics majors lend advice on careers

By NELLE MCCORKLE

Economics majors graduating
in 1981 indicated the ways they
found jobs, described their past
and present positions, and advised
current Davidson students in re-
sponse to a Davidsonian question-
naire.

Davidson’s 1981 graduating
class included 59 economics
majors; 18.6 percent responded to
the questionnaire. Three of the
eleven alumni responding hold
MBAs (an additional three are
now in business school); two
others have eared law degrees.
One graduate went directly to
business school from Davidson;
both lawyers went straight to law
school.

Two respondents found their
first jobs through the Davidson
Careers Office. Both worked for
commercial banks in the
Carolinas. One of three alumni,
who has since eamed an MBA,
called commercial banking “a
great place to start. Consulting
would probably be equally as
good. An analyst on Wall Street is
ideal but grueling.”

Asked what jobs or industries
present economics majors should
consider, another alumnus wrote,
“More Davidson students should
be going to top management con-
sulting firms or Wall Street invest-
ment banks. When I was at David-
son I did not know these industries
existed, but most top students at
Ivy League or other top schools
who go into business start in these
two industries.” A second year
student at Harvard Business
school, this respondent called
commercial lending ‘excellent
preparation” for those expecting
immediate entrance into business
school. He considered line man-
agement or sales positions valu-
able for two to three years.

Specific course advice in-
cluded recommendation of philos-
ophy from a corporate lawyer, En-
glish from a computer program-
mer, and mathematics from a
Ph.D. candidate in finance. This
last respondent wrote, “You

would be well advised to take all
of the mathematics that you can. It

looks good and if you have any
ability at all, you will be at quite
an advantage.”

“A big problem here at UNC
with people coming out of both
the MBA program and (to a lesser
extent) the undergraduate Busi-
ness Administration program is
that they cannot write and cannot
think critically!!”

“Because of the fine liberal
arts tradition at Davidson, I am
sure that this problem is not as se-
vere. Employers are typically at
least ten years behind the times in
realizing educational trends, but
are now finally realizing that both
MBA and undergraduate BA de-
grees are no guarantee of a good
employes 48 fact, they can con-
tributeto narrow-mindedness and
a lack of creativity. What is
needed is an education that pre-
pares the student to think critically
and orginally and provides the
tools to utilize ideas. Thus it is im-
portant to take: literature classes
(and maybe art history, religion,

Humanities) and as much
mathematics aS you can
stomach.”

In the economics department,
courses graduates considered

helpful in getting and holding jobs
include, macroeconomics, micro-
economics, and introductory and
intermediate accounting. One
alumnus wrote, “Take both ac-
counting courses. Extra outside
school if you're really ambitious.”
Now employed in Charlotte in-
vestment banking, this alumnus
called accounting the “single most
important subject” for finding a
job in his field. He wrote,
“Economics is the best prepara-
tion for general business at David-
son, especially financial manage-
ment. A lot of companies dis-
criminate against liberal arts
people — which is not to say lib-
eral arts is not great preparation
for business. Think about an
MBA.”

Brooks Harvey, the real estate
branch of Morgan Stanley, and an
alumnus who will be employed by

“Other courses and summer,
part-time and intern experiences
graduates advised present David-
son students to consider are,
“Anything that is enjoyable and
indicative of a well-rounded per-
son,” according to an Atlanta
lawyer. He wrote, ‘‘The personal
relationships and contacts that you
develop at Davidson will gener-
ally prove to be much more valu-
able than anything you will get
from class.”

“For summers and part-time,”
another graduate wrote, “do any-
thing that interests you, but the
more initiative required to get the
job and the closer it parallels what
you want to do later, the better off
you will be later.” The graduate of
the Daiden School now working
for Brooks Harvey wrote, “Sum-
mers are best spent outside or in
some entrepreneurial job. (1 cut
trees.)"

A second-year student at the
Wharton school who will be em-
ployed by Merill Lynch Capital
Markets as a corporate finance as-
sociate upon graduation called it
“critical to get some relevant work
experience (even if you have to
volunteer or work for virtually
nothing!) with a large company
prior to starting your job hunt.”
He wrote, “Start interviewing
over Christmas of your senior
year. Work on that resume! Use
Davidson alumni contacts in New
York City.”

Summer inteming at North
Carolina banks for exposure was
suggested by a First Atlanta com-
mercial loan officer. He wrote,
“Don’t be afraid or appear timid to
take the initiative in setting up
contacts . . . also the sooner the
better (i.e. freshmen and sopho-
mores). Employed by Wachovia

Bank & Trust after eaming an
MBA from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, this

A defense
against cancer
can be cooked up
in your kitchen.

Fruits, vegetables, and whole-
grain cereals such as oatmeal, bran
and wheat may help lower the risk
of colorectal cancer.

Foods high in fats, salt- or
nitrite-cured foods like ham, and

alumnus advised “contacting
Charlotte or Winston-Salem
banks and inquiring about inter-
view schedules . . . perhaps set-
ting up your own interview with
out-of-state banks particularly in
Virginia and Atlanta.” He also
wrote, “Use Ken Wood's Office
to the fullest; he has and knows a
number of people who can be used
as contacts.”

In addition to course and work
experience advice, graduates of-
fered other suggestions to current
economics majors related to prep-
aration for careers while still at
Davidson. A lawyer wrote, “Do
well enough at Davidson to get in
law school and bust your fanny
once you get there.” According to
the second-year Wharton student,
Davidson students seeking careers
in investment or commercial
banking need “strong grades (yes,
grades do matter), strong leader-
ship abilities (elected positions),
and hustle and persistence.”

Among industries to consider,
alumni mentioned airline/travel/
transportation, construction/de-
velopment, corporate law, sales
and “industries that are growing or
in a state of major change (tele-
communications, transportation,
banking).” A Norfolk Navy sup-
ply officer responsible for man-
agement of thirty people and a
several-million-dollar budget
wrote, “Don't rule out govern-
ment as an initial ‘industry’ to
work in, particularly the military.
No matter what anybody tells you,
there are never enough good
lawyers. The compensation is
good, and the work is exciting.”

Only two of the eleven respon-
dents work currently at the first
job they held after graduation: the
Navy supply officer and Delta Air
Lines computer programmer have
continued with their original em-
ployers. Others report having held
several jobs, as in the case of the
Charlotte investment banker with
Bowles Hollowell Conner &
Company. who worked as a North
Carolina National Bank Credit
analyst before earning a Univer-
sity of Virginia MBA.

Respondents reported plans

fish and

for jobs or positions they hope to
hold in twenty years, including re-
tirement ownership of a small
manufacturing concern, venture
capitalism, independent construc-
tional development financing,
policy-making for a_ federal
agency, Navy government con-
tracting/program § management
and economics/finance/mathema-
tics college professorship.”

One graduate found her Delta
Air Lines job through “a neighbor
who told me they were hiring.”
Asked about ways to find a trans-
portation industry job, she re-
sponded, “Unfortunately, it’s re-
ally being in the right place at the
right time. It helps to know some-
body and you have to be persis-
tent.”

For students interested in
areas other than banking or con-
sulting, the Harvard Business
School student advised, “Learn all
you can about the industry. Write
to firms that interest you and send
a resume, follow up with a call
and an offer to come interview at
the company’s convenience.” A
Dalias developer wrote, “Be pre-
pared to cope with a rapidly
changing economy. Be innova-
tive. Look for the up-side of any
situation.”

Several respondents em-
phasized the value of economics
specifically in today’s job market,
but many spoke of the value of lib-
eral arts in general. The Brooks
Harvey financier wrote, “Enjoy
the liberal arts while you can. It's
an enormous hidden asset which
improves with age.” The graduate
writing computer programs for
Delta Air Lines wrote, “It's tough
to get started on a career with a lib-
eral arts education, but it is true
what they say that you'll be better
off later on. I think Davidson
teaches you to be self-reliant and
really think things through. In any
career you choose you can use
some knowledge from Davidson.
Preparing for a big presentation,
researching information, produc-
ing new ideas are all things we've
done at Davidson that you do in
