Picnic Held on Campus as Part
Of High School Junior-

With the arrival of Spring,
both young and old begin to
think of picnics and other sim-
ilar outings. The well of the
Davidson campus served as the
center of a picnic held by the
Junior and Senior Classes of
Badin High School last Wed-
nesday afternoon from two-
thirty to seven-thirty,

It is customary, as a part of the
Junior-Senior Reception of Badin
High School for these classes to
take a trip with one of the athle-
teams. This year they chose to
witness the Freshman-Badin Base-
ball game.

Ninety in Party

After the game they had picnic
supper at the well. Davidson lays
claim to three boys from Badin who
also attended the affair and are now
with us. These are: Johnnie Clark,
freshman; Norris Erb, sophomore;
and Bill Davis, a teacher in the Da-
vidson High School. There were
ninety in the party which
was composed of about half boys
and half girls, all ranging from a-
bout fourteen to eighteen years of

about

age. Also with them were their,

Literary Societies Picnic With
Dates at Club House
Thursday Evening

Charlotte Shriners’ Red Fez
Club was the scene last Thurs-
day night of a joint party of
the Philanthropic Literary So-
ciety and the Spectator Club
of Queens-Chicora College.

Due to limited facilities, only
thirty-five members of each group
were able to be present. The trip
to the Red Fez Club grounds and
back was made in hayfilled trucks,
which left Davidson at 4:30 P.CM.,
stopping in Charlotte to pick up the
girls, food, and chaperons, the lat-
ter being Dr. Stout and Miss Har-
old of the Queens-Chicora facul-
ty.

Entertainment

After the consumption of the pic-
nic supper, which was provided by
the Spectator Club, the group gath-
ered on the porch of the clubhouse
for a program of entertainment or-
ganized and conducted by Mr. J.
Daniel Walker, chairman of the
program committee of the Phi soci-
ety. A large number of those pres-
ent took part in the entertainment
features, many extemporaneously.

At an appropriate time in the fes-
tivities announcement was made of
the presentation of a miniature gold
gavel to Rod Williams in recogni-
tion of his long and faithful ser-
vice. The retiring president of the
Spectator Club, Olive Croswell, was
likewise honored by a gift from the
members of her organization, Fran-
ces Hunter is the retiring secretary-
treasurer,

Ceremonies Discussed

A committee appointed by the
society’s executive committee met
last Saturday afternoon with the
professors of the English depart-
ment and Professor C. G. Davidson
to discuss the reviving of the tra-
ditional commencement ceremonies
in connection with the literary soc-
iety, and the collection of the
cream of student literary efforts
from year to year. These would be
kept in the form of a permanent
anthology in the library, being
bound every five years. The mem-
bers of the committee were Ivan
Stafford, Lawson Withers and Rus-
sell Smith.

Don Hott has recently been doing
extensive research in the archives
of the society.
