Dean of the Faculty Fron-
tis W. Johnston revealed
Wednesday night that he
voted against Davidson’s
participation in the National
Invitational Basketball Tour-
nament to be held in New
York this month.

Johnston was one of the five
members of the Southern Con-
ference Executive Committee
who voted Tuesday on whether
or not the Wildcats should play
in the tournament.

The executive committee turn-
ed down a request by the col-
lege after an NIT invitation to
let its team participate. The fi-
nat breakdown of who voted for
or against participation was not
released: however Athletic Di-
rector Tom Scott said that four
of the five members of the com-
mittee would have to approve.
The committee was polled by
Conference Commissioner’ Lloyd
P.- Jordan on a telephone con-
ference hookup.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C.

Johnston gave four reasons
for his vote against participation
in the NIT by the Wildcats.

“As a former NCAA council

member,” said Johnston, ‘I
know how it frowns upon par-
ticlpation by its member
schools In the NIT. The NCAA
guarantees the Southern Con-
ference champion a piace in
its tournament every year. |
would not want the conference
to do anything to jeopardize
this treatment.”

Johnston gave as a second rea-
son the fact that he did not want
to antagonize other coaches who
might not approve of David-
son's playing in the NIT. The
fact that the conference has a
guaranteed place in the NCAA
tournament aids their recruiting,
he said.

“I also do not believe partici-
pation would be in the best in-
terests of Davidson College,"
Johnston said. ‘I realize that
this is a personal viewpoint and
that many here perhaps believe

Dual Concert Heads
IFC Weekend Plans

The IFC spring concert weekend kicks off tomorrow
afternoon in a rather mild departure from previous func-
tions with a double-barreled program in Chambers Audi-
torium, featuring Oscar Brown and the Brandywine

Singers.

Brown is remembered by most
Davidsonians for his successful
concert in the fall of 1962. He is
recognized as one of the better
actor-singers in the folk-music
field today, because of his dif-
ferent characterizations to fit
his original songs,

Most reviews describe his
songs as “electrifying.” and
Brown himself refers to his lyr-
ics as ‘“‘verses about feelings
T've felt and scenes I've dug.”

The Singers, five of them. orig-
inated at the University of New
Hampshire and are rising fast on
the concert circuit. IFC presi-
dent Haynes Kelly reports that
on a recent meeting of 30 col-
lege representatives, the Bran-
Gywines were booked through
the end of this year. _

Known for their ‘‘button-down
singing,” they always put much
preparation and research into
their performances. Never-
theless, folk music is their busi-
ness and that is what they sing.

In preferring two lesser-known
attractions in an afternoon se-
sion for $3000 rather than a big-
name “bomb,” Kelly has opti-
mistically referred to this as one

of the IFC's better ‘‘darkhorse”
weekends.

The concert begins at 2 in
Chambers. The two may follow
each other or alternate during
the three-hour, two-intermission
performance.

For those with other prefer-
ences, the campus is full of other
activities for the weekend.

French Week ends at Davidson
tonight with the performance of
“The Lark’, by the French na:
tional touring company. Stu-
dents from many high schools
and colleges in the area will be
on campus for the play.

For the more avid fans, the
Southern Conference Wrestling
Tournament began this after-
noon in Johnston Gymnasium.
It will end tomorrow night.

Also, the college administra-
tion is courting its scholarship
finalists on campus for the week-
end, Most of the high-schoolers
arrived yesterday and will have
the entire weekend to evaluate
the college propaganda.

At any rate, review-worn Da-
vidson students are facing one
gf the college's more varied
spring weekends.

Johnston Votes Against
‘Cats Accepting NIT Bid

we should play. But the NIT
does not have the prestige of the
NCAA Tournament.”

Finally Johnston said that
he did not believe Davidson
should be permitted to enter
the NIT when other Southern
Conference teams have been
turned down in the past by
the conference.

Johnston cited the Furman
team of the mid-50s as a prece-
dent for the committee's deci-
‘sion. That was the season of the
great Frank Selvy, and Furman
received a bid to exhibit its star
in the NIT. The conference's ex-
ecutive committee turned down
Furman's request to play.

“You must realize, too. that
the NIT did not even invite the
runner-up in the conference this
year, George Washington,”
Johnston added.

Council Debates Use
Of Book Spot Check

By RON SNOW

In a meeting with Dr. Chal-
mers Davidson and Howard Ar-
buckle, the Student Council de-
cided that a spot check will be
held in the future as the second
in a series of moves to correct
the library situation. Not to be
confused with a secret police ef-
fort, the check would be an in-
centive to return the missing
books.

Reporting to the Student Coun-
cil on the library situation, Dr.
Davidson said that last year a
check of the library stacks and
cards revealed that 250 books
were missing.

Suggesting various solutions,
he cited the fact that one can‘t
always appeal to the ‘‘Davidson
honor” in cases like this, be-
cause there are no specific rules
covering it.

pose rules, the students would

who wishes to become a candi-
date for office must personally
file a statement (see Sec. 2d,
Student Council By-Laws) with
the Elections Chairman in 13
Duke. showing his willingness to
tun. This may be done any after-
noon or evening of the days
designated for filing by the Elec-
tions Committee. No person may
become a candidate who does
not file within the appointed
deadline.

The positions which are to be
filed for by candidates are: each
classes’ respective Student Body
Officer (President, Vice-Presi-
dents, Secretary - Treasurer),
Honor Court. Freshman Advisor
from the rising Senior Class, and
Student Council positions.

Once a candidate has filed, he
shall be allowed to submit a
platform to the Elections Com-
mittee. The committee will then
return 200 printed copies of the
platform to the candidate for
his personal distribution. The ex-
pense of those statements will
be paid for by the Student Coun-
cil.

Common ballots will be given
to each class with all positions
being voted on that day. This
means that there will be three
groups of elections requiring a
maximum of nine voting days.
The only exception is the office
of the President of the Student

Body which will not appear on
the ballot on Mar. 19, but which
will appear on the runoff ballots
of Mar. 20 and 23, if necessary.

This is done because Presiden-
tial speeches cannot be made
until Mar. 19 chapel period. The
day's delay will allow the Stud-
ent Body enough time to discuss
the candidates and their plat-
forms.

The seemingly early deadline
for filing will enable THE DAV-

IDSONIAN to publish a complete
list of the following week's can-
didates and offices. For the first
time, the Student Body will be
aware of who the candidates are
before picking up their ballots
to vote.

It should also allow greater
discussion of each candidate
before the voting starts. THE
DAVIDSONIAN will also carry a
brief description of each office
and exactly what duties that of-
fice entails.

Also for the first time, it is
hoped that each candidate will
be introduced in chapel on the |
day of voting. This will help the
Student Body to associate faces
with names of the candidates
that they may have heard of or
seen but without their knowing
who the person is.

The opirdon voiced by Spratt

dent Council. The council! defeat-
ed Spratt’s suggestion of organ-

make the request were precipi-

and I plan to write a formal re-
quest to the Executive Commit-
tee asking them to reconsider
the entire matter of campusing
and to review their whole pol-
icy of meting out punishment.”

Spratt said that he and Ar.
buckle had already discussed
some substitute punishments and
some ways to modify the penal-
ty of requiring students to re-
main within the town limits of
Davidson for a specified period
of time.

“We are going to meet again
fo select more alternate penal-
tles 0 campusing,” Spratt
sald. “We have already de-
cided to suggest that, instead
of campusing students who
overcut chapel or vespers, the
punishment be changed so that
those who overcut will tose a
certain portion of thelr cuts
the next semester.”

“Of course; if a senior over-
cuts the second semester, then
campusing may be the only al-
ternative for him.

‘Another concrete proposal
that we have decided to make
is that if a student breaks cam-
pus and confesses immediately,

more days from the time he
broke campus, rather than being
campused for another month
after his first month of campus-
ing runs out.

“What we are trying to do,”
Spratt continued, “fis to devise
punishments more applicable to
the offenses and to make penal-
ties more constructive. We be-
lieve punishments should have
more than just a negative ele-
ment.”

Spratt said that he and Ar-
buckle would also ask the Dean
of Students to confer with the
Student Council President and
the Honor Court Chairman be-
fore students are formally tried
by the Executive Committee for
disciplinary matters.

“If this is done,”’ Spratt said,
“then we can consull with
him and register student opin-
ion with the committee be-
fore they moet.”

Spratt pointed out that he us-
ually did not know what action
was taken on students until after
they had been tried and pun-
ished. “Then. it is too late for

“If I can register student opin-

The case of the Kappa Sig sen-

statement. He was surprised by

The senior was tater tried

-He was campused for the re-

The usual pénalty for bredking
curfew is a $25 fine from the
IFC. The senior also paid this
fine.

The Kappa Sigma fraternity
was also punished for the actions
of members in the house. On
both nights of the weekend,
members were caught breaking
curfew. [t was the third straight

violated rules during the week-

General Probation means that

that if any of the provisions of

Jazz Combo Gives
lts Second Concert

The Contemporary Jazz Trio,
playing. a program of all new
music in the modern jazz vein,
will give its second concert of
the year Friday evening, March
13,at 8:15 at Hodson Hall.

The group, which includes Sid-
ney Farrar on piano, Stanley
Kerr on bass, and Dave Hoag on
drums, has been playing togeth-
er since the first of the school
year and has performed various
parties and programs over the
past months.

Since their first concert in the
Morrison room of the Union the
group has graduated to the fa-
cilities of the Cunningham Fine
Arts building and has broadened
its program to include the music
of Henry Mancini, Thelonius
Monk, Duke Ellington. Johnny
Williams, and. originals by the
group.

There will be no admission
charge.

according to Bob Young, As-
sistant Dean of Students.

Both Spratt and Arbuckle
feel that the punishment given’
to the Kappa Sig is too harsh
for the offense committed.
They have already written a
letter to the Executive Com-
mittee stating this fact: “We
believe that the punishment ex-
ceeds the offense, that it is an
undue restriction,” If says.

The letter also suggests that
the senior be released from the
campusing restriction at mid-
semester, if his grades rea¢h the
average that the college feels he
should have: Dean Richard C.
Burts said ‘that the committee
would take action on Spratt's let-
ter at its next meeting and
would also consider the new pro-
posals that Spratt will request.

“TI cannot say when the next
meeting will be, however,’’ Burts
said. “The committee only
meets on call; we do not have
regularly scheduled meetings.”

Spratt said that he thought the
punishment of the Kappa Sigma
fraternity was also out of line
with the offense committed. ‘‘I
think that only General Proba-
tion would be perhaps more re-
alistic."’ he said. Spratt said that
he had talked to one member of
the Executive Committee and
that he felt that there may be a
chance that the fraternity will
be released from its restrictions
after spring vacation. “I just
have a feeling that there may
be a chance, but I really have
little to base it on."

Spratt cited two other cases
this year that he felt were
handled unjustly by 1:.e com-
mittee. Both involved = the
breaking of campus and help-
ed form the basis of one of
Spratt’s intended requests for
changing of the penalty.

**Bill Council and Decker Faw
broke campus unintentionally
and were both campused for
thirty additional days. even
though they confessed immedi-
ately and stated the circum-
stances,"’ Spratt said.

“Faw went to teach Sunday
School in Barium Springs and
suddenly realized after he had
gotten out of town what he had
done. Council went to Moores-
ville to play tennis with Dr.
(James Y.) Causey. accepting
the invitation without remem-
bering that he should not have
left town.”

Spratt said that he and Ar-
buckle objected to each of the
campusing cases during Student-
Faculty Conference Committee
meetings. “‘We also stated oral-
ly that we hoped the Executive
Committee would review its en-
tire policy of campusing and
made recommendations for
changes. Since no action has
been taken. we felt it necessary
to write out specific proposals
and present them formally to
the Executive Committee.’
