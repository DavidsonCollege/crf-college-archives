Stone Modifies P.E.

For Juniors, Seniors

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Senior News Editor

The physical education
program next year will differ
from the present program in
several respects. Director of
Physical Education Chip
Stone has decided to modify
some of the course offerings,
and to require all juniors and
seniors who have not fulfilled
their P.E. requirement to par-
ticipate in a scheduled
program.

In the past, juniors and
seniors had been able to take
proficiency tests to fulfill the
requirements. As of next year
this will no longer be the case.
The tests will be open only to
freshmen and sophomores.

Those juniors and seniors
who have not demonstrated
proficiency in four individual
and one team sport as
required for graduation, will
have two options. They can
either enroll in classes of in-
struction in various activities,
which will be offered next
year on the same basis they
are offered this year, or take
one of the two new seminars
which are planned.

Those who
requirements could gain
credit by completing a
seminar covering such topics
as ‘‘the psychology of sport,
and the value of sport.’’ Stone
indicated that both of these
courses would meet on a
regular basis and attendance
would be required.

Those who lack only one
credit can enroll in what
Stone refers to as ‘‘a program
of assorted activities.’’ It
would meet three times a
week and include such ac-
tivities as weight lifting and
other conditioning programs,

lack two

fencing, and other indoor
sports.

Stone hopes that such a
program will eliminate the
last minute rush to fulfill
requirements which became
traditional in the last several
years. As of the beginning of
this term 36 seniors had not
completed their requirernents.
However, all but eight have
made arrangements to do so.
Approximately 70 juniors

have not completed their P.E.
requirements.
Vice President for

Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan indicated that he in-
tends to support the P.-E.
requirement for graduation as
stated in the College

catalogue. “‘If they don’t fulfill
the requirement, they don’t
graduate,”’ said Bevan. ‘I’m
going to be as firm as can be.”
Only the President and the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty have the power to
override a decision by the
Vice-President for academic
affairs.

Next year will also see some
changes in P. E. course of-
ferings. Stone said he plans to
expand the most popular ac-
tivities, and points to sailing,
jogging, and ballet as those
which will most likely be af-
fected.

Some of the less popular of-
ferings such as squash may
not be offered.

following. The committee is
also considering the merit of a
year-round program at David-
son, but this question was not
pursued at the meeting.

Two semester systems, a
traditional one beginning Sep-
tember 15 and February 2 and
an early semester plan begin-
ning September 2 and January
12 were discussed. Young
cited such student benefits as
an extended add-drop period
and increased time for resear-
ch, experiments, etc.

Also, faculty members
could have more time on their
sabbaticals under a semester
system. Young added that he
thinks the general atmosphere
at Davidson would be more
relaxed under this system.
There would also be an op-
portunity for shorter, more in-
tense courses within the 15
week semesters.

Possible problems with the
system include how to work in
sequence courses like the
humanities program, how
many courses should be
required each term, and how
to schedule lab periods for
larger science classes.

The four-one-four system in-
volves having two 14-week ter-
ms in the fall and spring and
having a one month term from
January 5 through February
3. Taylor cited the advantages
of this program.

Students could concentrate
intensely on a_ single
class.Groups could work on
current political, social , and
scientific problems. Taylor
said that he would benefit
from a current affairs class
because it is difficult to keep
up with events under the

under the pressured workload
at Davidson.
Also the four-one-four

system offers possibilities for
internships and short-term
foreign study which would be
in the range of more students
financially. He suggested that
the four-week period might be
used to give students practice
in independent study that they

may not otherwise get.

Many of the objections to the
semester system also apply to
the four-one-four vlan. and
Professor of Physics Robert
Manning added that one mon-
th may not be enough time for
certain in-depth research or

experiments. Possible
variations on the four-one-four
systems include a four-four-
one (with the short term at the
end of the school year ) and the
one-four-four (with the short
term at the beginning of the
school year. )

SGA Settles Overdue
Affairs With Aplomb

By STEVE BELL
News Editor

The Senate realized a
quorum at its meeting
Tuesday night and was able to
clear away a backlog of items.
In major business, the Senate
passed a motion from Senator
Bob Corlew recommending
that federal tax deductibility
be extended to college tuition.

Corlew’s motion argued
that. ‘“‘Whereas education is
no longer a luxury for the
few, but it is a necessity for all
the young people of America,”’
educational tuition up to $500
per year should be made tax
deductible. The motion passed
10-3, with two abstentions, and
will be forwarded to North
Carolina's U.S. Congressmen
for their consideration.

In other major business, the
Senate heard a report from
the SGA Psychological Coun-
seling Liason Committee
(SCC). The college adminis-
tration recently announced
that its support of Meredith
Hall, the school’s clinical psy-
chologist, will be reduced next
year.

This leaves the SGA
in an uncomfortable position,
as the Senate reaffirmed its
own subsidy of Hall's ac-
tivities just last year.

John Munce, parliamen-
tarian of the Senate, is
chairing the PCLC. Munce's
committee is seeking a
redefinition of the SGA’s
position in the light of these
developments, and is con-
sidering the possibility that its
funds for Hall will need to
be increased next year.
.The.Senate also considered
a motion calling for a re-
organization of the Campus

Tax Council(CTC) to include
five students, the co-ordinator
of student activities, one
member of the faculty, and as
co-chairmen, the College
treasurer and a member of the
Senate Executive Committee.
The motion passed 15-1.

Steve Smith, current chair-
man of the CTC, went on to
propose Dana English, John
Randolph, Todd Eades, Bob
Corlew, and Duncan Moore for
the student positions on the
committee. All of Smith’s
Suggestions were confirmed
by the Senate.

In other business, the Senate
revised some __ tentative
decisions that had been
reached the week before. Ten-
tative appropriation of funds
enabling Karl Goodhouse and
Laurie Dunn to attend a
Student Health Care Con-
ference was confirmed.

However, full support for
the National Student Asso-
ciation Southern Area Con-
ference was extended to
Mark Rabil and Bo Hunter
only.. Vince Rabil and Bo
Phillips will receive partial
support, and Janet Whitehurst
Lynne Keener and Steve Bell
were cut off completely.

The Senate also passed a
motion from Senator Alan
Blakley requesting that North
Carolina Governor James
Ho! review the “Lazy-
B Stable Case”’. It also heard
reports from Blakley and the
SGA Admissions Committee,
Ed Willingham and _ the
Security Committee, Jim
Goodloe and the Self-Study
Committee of Students, and

Bob Meyer on the Food Con-
ference
