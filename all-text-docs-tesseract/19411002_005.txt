game.

Greensboro wasn’t enough for
Hobbie. After the game he head-

ed for the fair city of Spartanburg

where he spent a “quiet’’ Sunday at
Converse.
Sunday night, after everything

had calmed down, there was a feed
at the house.

Phi Gamma Delta

Practically the entire Fiji, band
left the campus and headed north
for the city of G-boro. Phi Gams
were to be seen on every bumming
corner between here and that fair
city.

The Brothers who were present to
witness the Wildcats hold the Wolf-
pack to a 6-6 tie were: Amos Ragan,
“Butch” Pharr, Howell Morrow,
Reah Dabney, Bob Crowell, Bill
Campbell, Rufus Nimmons, “Hank”
Crane, Pete Cavert, Arch Taylor,
Bill Summers, Dan Hodges. and
Tony Darby.

Most of the remaining Brothers
found their way to Charlotte be-
fore the week-end was over. But
some few spent a miserable time
fiere on the campus.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon

The S.A. E.’s took in the State
game at Greensboro Saturday night
With almost évery” brother and
pledge present with the exception
of the chapter’s honte-loving little
group, the Campus Kids, who en-
joyed a barbecue at Mrs. Baird's.

The highlight of the weekend
was a delightful barbecue supper
Saturday afternoon at the beautiful
home of Mr. and Mrs. E. F. Lucas,
father and mother of Brother Ed
and Pledge Jack. A number of
brothers and pledges further enjoy-
ed the gracious hospitality of the
Lucases, spending the night at the
Lucas home, lo¢ated just outside of
Greensboro, while still more stayed
with other members there.

The week-end was further en-
liveiied by the presence of Brother
Bill Grosse, who has-been a visitor
on the campus for the past few days.
Bill capably officiated at a gala
party at the Boar and Castle after
the game.

Kappa Sigma

With the exception of three boys,
the entire Chapter journeyed to
Greensboro for’ the game. Among
the remaining three was Alston
Thompson who just had to visit
the Queen City. Pledges Gault
and Henderson talso limited their
excursions to Charlotte.

In Greenfboro the brothers and
pledges with their dates were enter-
tained by Brother Carter with a
buffet supper at his home. That,
coupled with a sensational game,
made the week-end an exceptionally
successful one.

Brothers Booth, Amos, Phillips
and Taylor remained in Greensboro
Sunday night. Brother Dick took
a quick trip to Sumter, S. C, Sun-
day. Brother Kelly went to Lynch-
burg after the game. Brothers Man-
ning and Conyers found time to
visit their home in Spartanburg, S.
C. Brothers Amos, Simmons, and
Marsh and Pledges MiWis, Ellis,
and Short visited their homes in
High Point accompanied by several
Brothers and Pledges.

PHI TO MEET

Pritchett Speaks On Man’s
Need For Divine Friendship

At the vesper service last Sunday
Gur pastor, Rev. C. R. Pritchett
spoke about “The Friendship of
Jesus Christ.” Mr. Pritchett gave
to each of those who attended a
realization that the greatest friend
a man can have is Jesus, our Savior.
“One of the assets of college life,”
he asserted, the formation of
sincere, lasting friendships.” One
ought to begin at his very first
entrance to college to choose his
friends with care. Taking his text
from John 15:1-17, the speaker en-
larged upon the way in which we
can make friends with Christ. “Ye
are my friends if you do whatsoever
I command you,” the Savior said,
Mr. Pritchett pointed out that Christ
enjoined us as Christians to love one

“is

another. “This,” he said, “would
discriminate our affection from
everyone, to those who are. the

friends of God.”

Our pastor closed his sermon by
telling of a former Davidson stu-
dent who, in attempting to rescue
a friend in this community was him-
self drowned, “Greater
no man than this,

love hath
that a man lay
down his life for a friend.”

The congregation was urged to
uphold, to the highest degree, the
great Davidson tradition of Friend-
ship, and the custom of speaking to
