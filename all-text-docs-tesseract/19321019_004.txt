giving a great amount of aid to the hospitals
there. Another main purpose of the .organ-

where small children whose parents are un-
able to give them the proper attention they
need are well provided for.

The Junior League makes its money to a
great extent by sponsoring various activities
in and around Charlotte and by contribu-
tions from all those who are able to help.

Each year they undertake a various num-
ber of things to make money, and this year
one of them is the sponsoring of the game
State and Davidson. This game
will be played in Charlotte at the Central
High School Stadium. Certain proceeds
from the gate receipts will go toward the
maintenance of the league. In return for
getting proceeds from the game, the league
is trying to interest as many people as they
can to come to the game so that a big crowd
will be in attendance.

Miss Bowles declared that there is pres-
ence around us, and we see a picture of
Christ with His crown of thorns, and’ He is
saying, “I came here that you might be
saved.” Christ is the God of the living. As
everything fades we come back to real
things; from thought to -actuality. The
teachings of Christ are a philosophy that
We realize that we must live an

when Christ was crucified, His fellowmen
called Him King.

Miss Bowles concluded her talk by lead-
ing the congregation in prayer.

FIVE YEARS AGO

Five men from among the student body
received the highest honor that can be
| awarded in collegiate circles when they were
extended bids last Saturday by Phi Beta
Kappa; national scholarship society. The
{men so distinguished were: ‘D. H. Howard,
Lynchburg, Vaes-H. B. Arbuckle, Jr., David-
son, N. C.; C. G. Davidson, Chester, S. C.;
| J. S. Grey, Richmond, Va,, and J. S. McAllis-
ter, Greensboro, N. C.

Captain.“Dick” Grey and his red and black
! teammates ran roughshod over Elon Satur-
poay afternoon on Richardson Field to ring
up their fourth consecutive victory of the
season. Elon brought out trick play after
trick play in an effort to cross the Davidson
goal line, but all. in vain. Grey and his ’Cats
came out on the long-end of a 27-0. score.

Again members of the Davidson faculty
have published books. Dr. Frazer Hood's
“Every Man’s Insurance,” and .Dr. C. K.
Brown’s “State Movement in Railroad De-
velopment,” are the latest works completed
by Davidson men. Both these’ books are
on ecohomic questions. Dr. Hood's “Every
Man’s Insurance” has been off the press for
some time, while Dr.-Brown’s work is ex-
pected off the press during the middle of
December.

TEN YEARS AGO, OCT, 19, 1922

New Chambers, for months a_ beautiful
dream to the students and alumni of David-
son, has emerged from the infant, stage of
fancy, and is now a concrete, tangible thing
toward which the eyes of Southern Pres=
byterians are focused.

The new building will be situated on the
site where historic old Chambers stood and
in general make-up will resemble. the old
structure from the exterior view. An ef-
fort will be made to use the four old col-
umns that now stand as a relic of the early
days of the college, but in case this cannot
be done they will be reproduced as nearly
as possible.

The Davidson Wildcats were held to a tie
on Wearn Field last Saturday afternoon by
Wake Forest when Heckman shot a 30-yard
pass to Johnnie Johnstone, who raced down
the field 45 yards to a touchdown. The final

The tobacco that is +

cut best for pipes might
be termed “whittle cut” or
“rough cut,” like Granger.
It requires a type of tobacco

: different from the tobacco
used for chewing tobacco
or cigarettes. Then again,
Granger is made by Well-
man’s Method.

Granger has a pleasing

aroma. It is slow burning
and cool. Just try it!
