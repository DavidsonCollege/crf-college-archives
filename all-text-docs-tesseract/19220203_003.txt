spheres of service.

In speaking of the need of the Chureh
the speaker showed plainly the need for
more and better service at home which
would result in an increased zeal and a
more efficient work for Christ in foreign
fields.

Turning toward the real meaning of
Christ, Doctor Reavis told of Christ's
simplicity, His great sacrifice, and His
wonderful moulding influence upon the
of those whom He has touched,
‘both in their person and in their spirit.

Finally, discussing the different
spheres of service, Doctor Reavis com-
pared the various professions to the
ministry, ,teaching, medicine, and bus-
iness, showing that each man. should
serve Christ where he knows that he
can serve Him with the best use of his
ability.

ing of 500 men of the highest tvpe of
character.

The new members of the club, the
Freshmen, have pledged their earnest
support to the drive, and many of them
are corresponding with the most promis-
ing young men of their high schools with
the idea of bringing them to Davidson
next year as students. The upper-class-
men are also taking an active interest
and have turned in, as prospective stu-
dents, the names of many men of the
type of character that Davidson stands
for. i

A definite goal always adds a certain
stimulus and interest to a campaign, and
with such an excellent one as the Greater
Davidson Club has chosen, together with
the undying loyalty of cach Davidson
student, the best of results are assured.
