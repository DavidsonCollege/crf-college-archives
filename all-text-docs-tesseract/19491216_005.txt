CAPTAIN-ELECT BLAKE BRADLEY

Bradley Chosen by Team Mates to
Captain 1950 Cross Country Team

By WOODY McKAY

Blake Bradley, the trim runner
from Decatur, Georgia, has been
elected unanimously by his team-
mates to serve as captain of the
cross country team in 1950.

Blake in his nonchallant way has
been running with the cross coun-
try team,since his freshman year,
and continues fo improve each sea-
son. “He’s improved a great deal
this year and we’re expecting even
greater things from him in track.”
This is what his coach, Pete Whit-
tle, has to say about him, and he
seems confident that Blake won't
let him down.

Stig htly overshadowed by
“Gunder’’? Grey, during the past
two years, Blake has come into
his own this year and has con-
sistently made better time than
Grey did. He added another feather
to his cap by placing eighth in the
Southern Conference, and that was
against some topnotch competition.

Not only is Blake outstanding on
the cross country team, but is an
outstanding letterman in track. His
slim, but strong frame will be re-
membered from his good work last
year as a distance runner. Having
completed a successful season in
cross country and aiming for big-
ger and better things next year,
his senior year, it ig only fitting
that he be selected to head up the
°S0 cross country team.

A preministerial student, Blake
always gives all-he’s got in a track
or cross country event. During
the past season, he took first place
in several meets and wasn’t far
behind in those in which he didn’t
cross the finish line first. He had
a tough break in one meet in
Raleigh when he got a cramp in
his leg and was forced to drop out.
Besides this one instance, he has

seasons in the future, because he
will probably be near the front in
any running event he participates
in,

U.N. SOCIAL...

(Continued From Page Three)

In a country like the Philip-
pines, she commented, all these
were concrete steps toward social
progress and human welfare in av
actual practical way.

Now, she said, there is a new
United Nations building in Mani-
la. It houses the technicians who
come and go with the world’s best
experience, texts and equipment to
help a small, poor country to lift
itself owt of the shackles of war,
and find its future by releasing its
own resources.

Mrs. Murphy mentioned Albania,
Austria, China, Czechosolvakia,
Ecuador, Greece, Guatemala, Hun-
gary, Italy .and Poland, among
other countries now receiving
similar assistance from the United
Nations.

The countries who are “giving”
advice and assistance are Austra-
lia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Den-
mark, France, the Soviet Union,
the United States, and the Union
of South Africa.

She pointed out that approxi-
mately one-half of the total num-
ber of United Nations member
countries are asking for experi-
ence and help from the other half,
but what is really gratifying to
note, she said, “is that in this non-
political field of human welfare,
there have been no_ hindrances.

JOHNNY RICHARDS

Covered Armfield Blocking Trophy Given
To Johnny Richards at Football Banquet

A center who realized the dream
of all linemen in his last collegiate
football game by lugging the ball
for 74 yards and touchdown, won
a trophy at the annual Davidson
football banquet Wednesday night
for never laying his hands on tlie

ball as a carrier.

Converse though the two above
statements seem, the Wildcats’
senior ball snapper, Johnny

Richards, became. the fourth man.
to win the Ed Armstrong blocking | ¢
trophy, awarded annually to the|d
best blocker on tlie squad as ascér-
tained by the coaching staff. Mr.
Ed Armfield of Greensboro, a Da-
vidson graduate, has made the
award for the past four falls.

In Mr. Armficld’s absence
Wednesday night, the trophy was
presented by Dr. William (Bill)
McGavock, member of the faculty
athletic committee. As usual, there
was an air of expectancy as to the
recipient of the award, but when
Dr. McGavock came to that point
in his introduction which _ re-
counted the 74-yard touchdown trip
by a center to score the first touch-
down in the Thanksgiving Day
battle with Citadel, the Cat was
out of the bag.

Richards, a Portsmouth, Va.,
husky who played four years of
football at the pivot spot for -the

‘Cats, becomes the third lineman |%
first/s

to win the trophy. The
award went to Earl (Red) Bethea,
now coach at Porter. Military
school in Charleston, S. C., a
blocking back. The two following
years the trophy went to E. T.
(Buddy) Chandler, then a sopho-
more guard, and Bob Sharpe, who

By BILL WHITE

had just completed his junior year
at guard, .

After running behind Mitton
(Bronco) Bailey last fall, Johnny
moved into the starting post this
year as a ball snapper, Late in the
season, however, he was. moved
to the lincbacking post and turned.

in an outstanding performance
there. Counted on as.a leading pivot
man on the basketball -ourt this
winter, Richards has currently
benched himself to catch up with
his studies, He hopes to rejoin
the crew after the Christmas holi-
days.
