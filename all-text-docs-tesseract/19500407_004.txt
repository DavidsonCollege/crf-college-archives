Davidson’s baseball
team, after suffering
four straight defeats
at the hands of New-
berry and Erskine, had
the honor to be on top
of the Southern Con-
ference—for 48 brief
hours — by virtue of
their win over UNC at
Davidson Saturday aft-
ernoon. Carolina
promptly juggled the
standings by thumping
® the local diamond men
in Chapel Hill Monday.
Anyhow, it looked good
to see Davidson at the

GORDON SCOTT
top in at least one sport, though short the time may have been.

CATS WIELD WEAK WILLOWS

Althouch the baseball season has just gotten into full swing,
one thing has already become apparent—if Davidson is to post
anything like the record expected of them in pre-season specula-
tion, someone is going to have to inject some dynamite into
their heretofore impotent bats, With six games behind them
‘through Monday's game with Carolina) the Cats have been
able to garner a total of only 19 hits among the whole team. It
doesn’t take much exertion of the brain cells to figure out that
this is an average of just 3.2 hits per game. No ball team can
win consistently on an average like that. Even in winning
ugainst Carolina, it was an unearned run in the bottom of the
eighth that salted away the win for the Cats.

This failure to produce at the plate can be attributed par-
tially to lack of practice. Rainy weather has of course kept the
team indoors for 4 number of days, and even when the skies
were clear, cold winds have prevented any hard work-outs. We
don’t expect this batting slump to be long-lived, but then it im-
mediatel¥ comes to mind that most ball clubs do their heaviest
slugging in the first part of the season. Not a few of us will be
anxiously following the Cats in the hope that they will upset
this axiom before many more games have gone by.

CINDERMEN EXHIBIT WARES

About all that can be said concerning Saturday's track
meet with Furman is that local fans got a glimpse of the po-
tential of Davidson’s ’50 cindermen. In piling up 113 points in
the meet the Red and Black trackmen completely dominated
the scene with the exception of the 220, 440 and shot events. The
Raptists forfeited: three events, the pole vault, javelin and mile
relay.

Coach Whittle was hesitant about commenting on the meet.
About all he would say was, ‘‘We hadn’t expected much com-
petition from Furman, but we thonght it would be more than
this.’ It was obvious that he was disappointed in the showing
Furman made, but he hastened to remind us that football is
king at the South Carolina school and that spring football drills
had prevented a serious concentration on the cinder sport.

GOLFERS STILL UNBEATEN

Following Wednesday's win over South Carolina on the
Charlotte Country Club course, Davidson's golf team remains
undefeated. To date the linksmen have driven by Ft. Bragg.
Catawba and South Carolina twice. This is particularly sig-
nificant in view of the fact that golf is the only varsity sport
at Davidson which doesn't have a coach from the Athletic De-
partment. The record that these men have posted ‘‘on their
own” is good in itself, but it’s interesting iu speculate just how
much better it would have been or will be if there was a regular
golf mentor from the Athletic Department. At present there is
no one particularly qualified to. fill this vacancy, but it would
be well for the administration to keep this need in mind when

Recently Selected

Athletic Director
To Assume Duties

According to a letter received by
Dr. Cunningham this week, Paul
Scott, new athletic director of Da-
vidson College expects to arrive
in Davidson on Monday April 10
to take up his new duties. In his
letter Scott stated that he was
bringing his family and moving
his household furnishings imme-

diately, which is contrary to ear-| ”

lier reports about his plans.

Scott revealed that after getting _
settled here in Davidson for two +

or three weeks, he would return to
Cornell College the first week in
May for spring matches in golf,
track, and tennis which he appar-
ently has a big -hand in. It will
probably be necessary for him to
remain in Iowa for about a week
and then he will return to David-
son to devote his full time to his
new position.

Thus, Scott will be the first full-
time athletic director at Davidson
since Norman Shepherd resigned
to take over the head basketball
coaching job at Harvard Univer.
sity. He has been director of ath-
letics at Cornell College in Iowa
and in addition has coached cross
country and wrestling teams which
have been undefeated in the Mid-
west. Only fast week, his wrestling
squad placed second in the Nation-
al AAU grappling meet.

In 1946 Scott was president of
the National Collegiate Cross
Country Association and from
1946 to 1948, he was a member of
the National AAU Wrestling Rules
Committee.

Davidson has been eagerly await:

staff of the Davidsonian is glad to
be among the first to extend a
hearty welcome to- Coach Scott, hi:

Cindermen Run Away from Furman
In Initial Meet By 113-17 Count

By JIM FARRAR

The Red and Black of David-
son had very little trouble in run.
ning over the Furrnan track team
Saturday afternoon by the huge
score of 113 to 17, Furman had
little or no track team, and it turned
into more or less a workout for
the track squad. The times for the
events were over what they should
have been. Of course, this may
be blamed on the very cold weather

land the lack of competition.

The individual star of the day
was Tommy Haller. Tommy got

almost enough points vo deféat Fur-

man, He was high point man for
the meet’ with sixteen points. Tom-
my placed first in the low hurdles,
and second in the broad jump, pole
vault and high hurdles.

Perhaps the most exciting race
of the day was between Thomason
of Furman and Klein of Davidson.
In the 440, Klein was behind over
ten yards on the last turn. How-
ever, he caught Thomason and
nearly> passed him, but couldn't
quite make it. The race had every-
one on their feet.

Much credit should be given to
the Furman boys, who, hopelessly
outclassed, never quit until they
had finished their race.

High winds were responsible for
the high scores turned in by some
of the participating golfers, and the
deciding factor in the match proved
to be Davidson's superior putting.
Hill, Cooper, and Vernon all sank
long puts when the chips were
down to give them their winning
margin.

In addition to Hill, other win-
ners for the Presbyterians were
Ben Vernon, Jim Sloan, and Bill
Cooper who halved with Westec-

By virtue of the brilliant hurling
performance he turned in against
the University of North Carolina
last Saturday, Fred Hengeveld has
been selected as Wildcat of the
Week.

In pitching the Presbyterian
squad to their first: win over North
Carolina since before the war, the
strapping righthander let down the
Tar Heels with .only = six hits,
struck out nine and issued no free
passes,

Hengeveld relied on his fast-
breaking curve slants to set the vis-
iting sluggers down. After the in-
itial innings of the game when the
Carolinians were able to push
across a pair of runs, Dutch settled
down and had them biting out of
his hands. Only once was he ser-
iausly threatened, thereafter, When
pitcher Henry Schact led off with
a triple. However after striking the
next batter out, Dutch saved his
own ball game by throwing
Schact out as he raced for home
after a slow roller had been hit to
the left of the mound.

Hengeveld is generally regarded
as the ace of the Cat hurling corps

Hengeveld Pitches
Win Over Tar Heels

By DAN McKEITHEN

After losing four straight balt
games on a holidays trip the Da-
vidson Wildcat baseball team re-
turned home last Saturday to beat
out the University of North Caro-
lina, 3-2, in its first conference
tilt. Due to extremely cold weather
the game was scheduled. for seven
innings, but it was tied two.all at
the end of that time. In the bot-
om of the eighth inning, shortstop
Chartey Pearson ted off with a
two-base blow and the stage was
set for the pay-off. Doug Rice,
Wildcat leftfielder, sent a hard
grounder to second. Carolina
Hesmer
stopped the ball, but when he
failed to field it cleanly, the alert
Pearson broke for the plate and
scored ahead of the throw.

Dutch Hengeveld pitched very
nice ball as he allowed the Tar
Heels six hits. He did very well
in the clutches and struck out nine.
In onc inning, opposing pitcher
Harry Schacht, who formerly
pitched for Davidson High School,
led off with a three-bagger, but
Dutch threw him out at the plate
by good fielding of a slow roller.

Only man to get more than one
hit was Carolina catcher Gurganus,
who got two of his team’s six, in-
cluding a double. Davidson's five
hits were gotten by Pearson, Bill
Bird, Auburn Lambeth, Henge-
veld, and Hal Mapes, who was
credited with a two-bagger.

Hengeveld, in winning his. first
game of the season, looks like he’s
ready to have his best year. He
has plenty of stuff and he failed to
walk a single man Saturday. With
a little hitting to back him up, he
should be very tough to beat.

tious game against Berney Segal,
but the latter was too consistent
for Teddy and finally won a hard-
fought match in three sets.

Roddey teamed with Whit Cobb,
who extended his man to three
sets in singles, to,form a good dou-
bles combination. After losing the
opening set 6.4 they were in com-
plete control and chalked ‘up 6-1
and 6-4 sets to win.

After the sun was pretty well
gone and all spectators ‘well, gone
Fanjoy and Palmer got down to
business, They capitalized on their
opponents’ errors and played good
enough tennis themselves to win
in three sets.

Davidson number six won out 4.6,

Keesler and Strand, Dawvidson’s
three and four men, couldn’t cope
with Prior and Windham, Florida’s
one and two, in the doubles.

It was definitely too cold and
windy for‘tennis and anything else
outdoors. However, you can’t take
anything away from these boys
from Florida. It was just their day,
but éveryone who braved the
weather agree they can have have it.
