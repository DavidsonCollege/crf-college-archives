The Student Council is seek-
ing non-votmg student repre-
sentation on
“Blue Sky Committee,”’ ac-
cording to council president
‘Chuck Matfhews.

Matthews said the student
tbody should have a member
an the committee, which is
«charged with considering all
saspects of the college, ‘‘due to
‘the value of our unique per-
spective on Davidson College
‘life. our interest in and re-
sponsibility toward the  col-
lege and to insure communica,,
tion between students and fac-
tulty.”

- Thus Student Body President
Chuck Matthews summarized
reasons why the Student Coun-
cil is seeking to place a stu-
dent on the faculty committee.
The Student Curriculum Re-
vision Committee, which par-
allels the faculty committee.

the faculty's,

t

met with the faculty commit-
tee Tuesday afternoon to dis-
cuss the proposal.

A decision by the faculty
committee is expected next
week. Earlier the committee
had voted not to allow stu-
dent representation but agreed
to discuss the matter with the
Student Council committee
and reconsider its decision.

“The faculty committee has
expressed a desire to receive
student opinion on curriculum
revision,’’ Matthews comment-
ed. ‘If they want student opin-
ion they should have a non-
voting student member of the
committee."

At the invitation of Dean of
Faculty Frontis W. Johnston,
the Student Curriculum Revi-
sion Committee has met and
decided to organize on the
same lines as the faculty com-
mittee.

If student representation is
not allowed on the faculty

committee, the student com-
mittee will serve as the indi-
rect student voice with the
faculty committee and wilt
pass along suggestions made
by students to the faculty
committee.

The Student Curriculum Re.
vision Committee believes that
there are no “sacred cows",
that there is nothing so good
at Davidson that it can’t be
improved, Matthews remark-
ed. They will consider three
areas for improvement.

First, courses, graduation
requirements, major require-
ments and other academic
standards will come in for.
careful scrutiny, according to

Matthews. “We will examine
required courses especially
hard," he said.

The committee will ask ques-
contimued: Are students pam-
pered at Davidson? If they had
more seminars and independ-

Davidsonian Solicits
$1 Study Donations

THE DAVIDSONIAN will ask
every student to give a dollar
next week to a fund for the Stu-
dent, Council Curriculum Com-
mittee, to be used to finance
research by the committee.

The faculty's Curriculum Com-
mittee has promised the stu-
dent committee funds to carry
out their independent work. but
Student Body President Chuck
Matthews. is convinced the com-
mittee will need additional funds
to do a thorough job.

Such activities as deputations
to schools experimenting with
currriculum.r e form s, visiting
speakers meeting with students
and exchanging ideas and cor-
respondence with institutions
and individuals involved in aca-
demic thought will require finan-
cial independence by the com-
mittee in order to be effective,
he said.

A secondary motivation for the
drive is to serve as an indica-
tion of student interest in the
work of curriculum reform. ac-
cording to DAVIDSONIAN staff
members.

“One of the main ideas of the
drive is to get as wide a range
of student participation as pos-
sible." according to Managing
Editor Bob Travers. ‘‘This is the
reason we aren‘t going to pres.
sure anyone into giving any
large sums—we'd rather have
600 people giving $600 than 200
people giving $600.”

Staff members will contact ev-
ery student on campus during
the first part of the week. and
results will be tallied in time ‘to
be recorded in next week's news-
paper.

“We're hoping to get 100 per
cent participation in the drive,”
commented Kern Parker, assist-

ant managing editor. ‘It would!

be a tremendous moralé booster
to be able to start off this proj:
ect with the knowledge that the
entire student body was behind
it.”

Matthews pointed out that it
would be important for the stu-
dent point of view to be pre-
sented in the curriculum study.
Members of the faculty commit-
tee will be making their own

Four Seasons Coming
For Concert Weekend

The Four Seasons with its
“Gold Vault of Hits’ will per-
form on campus Nov. 19 for
Concert Weekend.

Vince Foster, chairman of the
Social Council, said that the Sat-
urday of Concert Weekend wauld
also feature a varsity football
game against Wittenburg at :2
p.m. in Charlotte and a varsity-
freshman basketball scrimmage
in Johnston Gymnasium at 7
p.m.

Saturday night, ‘the Four Sea-
sons will perform from 8:30 un-
til 10:30 and will sing with their
own back-up group,”” Foster
said. The concert will be held
in Love auditorium and will be
open only to Davidson students
and their dates.

“We must have the concert
where the audio will be good.”

Foster added, but because ‘we

just can‘t seat all those who
want to attend,"’ the concert
will not be open to the public.

trins. to schools, Matthews ex-
plained, but their findings could
possibly differ from those of the
student.

“It would be unfortunate if
the efforts of the student com-
mittee were hindered by some.

ent study courses, might they
not become creative thinkers
and scholars rather than mere
regurgitators of facts?

What's wrong with the fac-
ulty-administration and the
students where so much em-
phasis has to be placed on the
artificial apparatus of grades
to make the educational sys-
tem function?

Second, methods of presen-
tation will be examined. ‘‘We
feel that the lecture method is
vastly overused,” Matthews
stated. ‘More seminars and
independent study courses are
needed.”

Third, everything else in
campus life will be discussed
by the committee. Dormitory
life, social life and fraterni-
ties, adequacy of the physical
plant, the library, subsidized
athletics and ROTC will be
among topics for scrutiniza-
tion. ‘

Matthews delineated three
reasons the Student Council
feels that there should be non-
voting student representation
on the faculty committee.

“First, this committee has
such a wide range of study
that what it decides will
change the lives of future stu-
dents. Because we do have the
perspective of students we
think we should have a voice.
Also, students think that they
have some good ideas.

“Second.” he — continued,
“students are interested in
making Davidson College a
better place. We don’t ask ‘for
student representation just be.
cause we exist at. Davidson,
but because we exist respon
sibly. and care about David
son.

“This interest is illustrated
by the 40 students who will
speak to high schools to which
the admissions office wouldn’t

have time to go.”

“Another example to prove
student interest is that the
Student Council will launch a
mammoth drive to help with
the Ford Foundation Chal-
Jenge Grant program. Over
the Christmas holidays we will
ask each student to make five
new friends for Davidson Col-
lege.” said Matthews.

The Student Council is now
preparing a course evaluation
for the end of the semester.
The results will be given to
each professor.

The council is also preparing
its own fund drive to raise
money, to do research and
visit other campuses about
curriculum revision.

Third. Matthews explained
that one of the stated purposes
of the faculty committee is to
improve relations between fac-
ulty and students. “The com-
mittee is neglecting one of the

goals it could most easily ac-
complish,”” he said. “Is it
tight for the means of the
evaluation to be immune from
the goals of the evaluation?”

“The committee is literally
considering the whole school.
We do not have the years of
experience of the faculty, but
we do have the immediate ex-
perience of the joys. sorrows,
and frustrations of Davidson
College educational experi-
ence which gives us a unique
perspective which would be
valuable for the committee.’

The Student Curriculum Re-
vision Committee is begin-
ning its research by reading
the Danforth Report on 800
colleges, last year’s self study.
and the reply of the Southern
Association of Colleges and
Universities to Davidson's self-
study.

The student committee plans
to use the results of its fund-

raising drive to bring speak-
ers from such schools as An-
tioch, Reed and other progres-
sive liberal arts colleges to
Davidson to discuss curric.
ulum. The faculty committee
is considering placing some
of its funds at the disposal of
the student committee for this
purpose.

After the student commit-
tee's fund drive, it will break
up into subcommittees which
will parallel the faculty sub-
committees. These have been
promised access to the facul-
ty. committee research ma-
terials. The ‘student comriii-
tee will do research and visit
other campuses.

Dean Johnston is chairman
of the faculty committee
which includes Professors J. H.
Ostwalt. Joe Embry, Charles
Ratliff, Earl MacCormac, Jim
Martin, Locke White. Frank
Bliss and Max Polley.

IF C To Contemplate
Total Affiliation Offer

|

The Interfraternity Council an-
nounced at its meeting Monday
night that it has set up a com-
mittee to consider a plan for to-
tal opportunity social affiliation
as a part of rush in 1967.8.

The committee plans to meet
once a week until they have
come up with a workable plan,
but they hope to have formu-
lated such a plan by the first
week: in December so that they
will have time to discuss it with
several other committees and
iron out any difficulties before
it is presented to the faculty.

The plan which the IFC com-
mittee is working on is designed
to give all freshmen in the class
of 1971 who desire to be in a
fraternity the opportunity to be
affiliated with one for at least

a year.
' The report of the Social Life
Evaluation Committee _ states

_that such a plan must be pre-
| sented: to the faculty by March
1, 1967.

If the faculty adopts a plan
for total opportunity social af-
{lliation, it will be the first of

The committee is composed of
Tom. Covington, Fraternity Li-

sistant Dean of Students: the of-
ficers of IFC: five fraternity
presidents: and an independent

This. answer is merely one
more answer to the larger ‘fra-

past few years. In early 1960 the

Parents
To Visit
Tomorrow

Parents of Davidson freshmen
come to campus tomorrow to
find out how the fine young men
they sent off two months ago
are holding up under the experi:
ence of living on their own.

The Freshman Council has
planned a host of activities for
them with the idea that the col-
lege will project to the parents
the daily life and environment
of their son at Davidson.

The activities begin with pa-
rental registration in the College
Union throughout the morning.
From 9:30 to 11:45 a.m. guided
tours of the campus will be pro-
vided by members of the Fresh-
man Council. Also available will
be visits to the freshman dorms
and visits to various classes al-
lowing for parents’ attendance.

The afternoon activities begin
with a buffet luncheon after
which will come an assembly
program for parents and sons
in Love Auditorium.

At 3 p.m. the formal agenda
ends with a faculty reception al-
lowing parents te get acquainted
with their son’s professors.

‘be new things,

He added that while there will
“these changes
have been in our minds for a
good while.”

LEARN ROPES
Newsom, also a junior and a.
psychology major from Corpus
Christi, Tex’, said, “I person-
ally see a lot of value in Ted
and I. getting the position this
early in the year, because we'll
have Charlie Vick around to

help us learn the ropes.”'

He addded that ‘there prob-
ably won't be much change in
format. We would like to work
more closely with contributors
to help them and encourage fu-
ture contributions.”

The changes in The Miscel-
lany started with the Student
Council meeting Monday before
last. This past Monday the Pub-
lications Board voted to remove
The Miscellany’s editor and busi-
ness manager from the board.

CONTROL LACKING
Board Chairman Louis Le-
sesne said, ‘‘The feeling of the
board was that since it had no
control over the selection of the
editor. it would make any sort
of financial control awkward.”

Members of the board, which
supervises the finances of the
student publications and nomi-
nates candidates for their ed-
itorship, are the editors and
business managers of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN, Quips and Cranks
and Wildcat Handbook, the col-
lege treasurer and one faculty
member.

Under the new arrangements.
The Miscellany will be under the
control of its Board of Advisors,
both editorially and financially.
The editor will be selected each
year by the board.

The Student Council changed
its By-laws concerning the elec-
tion of the editor of The Miscel-
lany because of ‘the urging of
Vick.

He’ stated last week, “An edi-
tor appointed on the basis of
editorial talent and dedication
would be superior to a popular-
ly elected editor.”
