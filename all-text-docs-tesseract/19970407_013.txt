Real life Studio Theater class
subjects unwitting audience to
extraordinary circumstances

By JAMEs BERRY
Staff Writer

“Guess What?” The question
was posted across campus and left
little clue as to the answer. Only the
slightest hint could be gleaned from
the sub-heading: Studio Theater
121/221, Thursday April 3 and Fri-
day April 4. If you wanted to know,
you’d have to go. And judging
from Friday night’s packed house,
the flyers did their job exquisitely
— making the production another
stop down the line of Frolic events.
j The idea of the Studio Theater

series relies entirely on student in-
vention. Each of the 15 scenes
performed was penned by a student
and revised as aclass. In addition to
scripts, the class is responsible for
most aspects of any theater produc-
tion: sound, light, and set. And then
there’s the acting. So, backstage
and on stage, students flaunted their
talents — and really, flaunted is
appropriate.

Unlike most Davidson Theater

(whether they be black box produc-
tions, mainstage productions, or the
upcoming student directed one-
acts), the Studio Theater class works
with a number of mostly unrelated
scenes. I say “mostly” because
many of the short skits were con-
nected by several through-line gags,
and all fell within the framework of
some twisted “Current Affair”
parody. The first and final scenes,
with everyone on stage, established
the context. What we were about to
see were short glimpses of real life—
under extraordinary circumstances
[insert X-Files title theme here].
The skits themselves varied
from serious to silly but certainly
tended toward the latter. One of the
openers, “Kindergarten Capers,”
was about a new girlinclass. Along
with her we meet a girl still afraid of
the dark, a boy with chronic nose-
picking tendencies, anda bedwetter
extraordinaire. Later, we learn the
truth behind the bedwetter’s claim
that the teacher is actually an alien.
Another skit, brilliantly per-

formed, centered around the love
affair between (female) Cupid and
the (male) Tooth Fairy and the con-
sequences of such passion. My
favorite of the bunch explored a
revolution (led by Leslie Greiner)
intending to return the South to the
seat of power.

A nice addition to the produc-
tion was a series of slides projected
between scenes that either put the
previous scene into context or
caught the cast in compromising
positions. More often than not they
drew as much laughter from the
crowd as the scenes themselves.

Everyone I talked to loved the
class to no end. Josh Buchanan,
playing everything from a dis-

‘ gruntled alien father to the fanatic

leader of the “Bopping Uncle Sam”
contingent of the Revolution, said
of the Studio experience: “I espe-

cially enjoyed the chance to work.

with three of my roommates — it’s
always fun to make fools of your-
selves as a group instead of indi-

vidually (like we usually do).”

David Wilcox sings his philosophy
“This is not Pollyanna, but it is definitley a way to
feel hope i in this world despite its imperfections.”

By Carrie Morris

David Wilcox, a singer/
songwriter from Asheville, NC, got
into music because, “music got into
me...it was the first place my heart
felt right...so I followed it like a
compass.” This reliable guidepost
has enabled Wilcox to produce five
albums, the most recent release (ac-
tually a re-issue of his first album)
entitled The Nightshift Watchman,
along his journey.

His upcoming album is due out
May 23, and he is calling it his
favorite one to date. It is called
Turning Point. Other collections
include East Asheville Hardware
and How Did You Find Me Here.

These five albums will provide
the material for Wilcox’s concert
here at Davidson Thursday, April
10th.

Not only is Wilcox a talented
musician, he is a poet. His clever,
honest lyrics speak clearly about
base human desires and revelations.
I asked him to name an artist who
inspires him, regardless of the me-
dium. The question proved bland
and conventional, but his response
was anything but ordinary.

“You know, you can’t hold a
person up and say ‘this person has
all the stuff.’ They’re just human
like us. When their heart is right,
they can show the light that is within
them.” As for the source of inspira-
tion, “there is something in the
unknown that pulls me. Inspiration
is always there if you let yourself be
open to it, it comes in the strangest
forms ... but the timing is always
right, we get what we need.”

These un-
expected
flashes of in-
sight are al-
ways the
places from
which we
learn the most,
Wilcox main-
tains. His be-
lief in the im-
portance of
these surprises
and random
moments of
clarity in life
is a part of
Wilcox’s phi-
losophy which
makes his mu-
sic and its mes-
sage so rich
with honesty.

can all under-
stand because he is working with
what we all know and wish to fol-
low; “a deeper level of joy and the
sorrow that is in the empty space.”
He believes in the fact that despite
all outside forces, we must learn to
sustain and be full with what is
within us.

My few moments speaking with
David Wilcox proved to be one of
these random moments he spoke
about. This interview exposed his
easygoing and faithful outlook to-
wards life and gaye me a sense of
peace that I was not expecting.

Wilcox is a dynamic and pow-
erful personality and just as mucha
poet offstage as he is in his music,
but he still likes for his music to

stand on its own. When asked for
any last words for his impending
performance here at Davidson, he
wanted to “stress the content” of his
work. “This is not Pollyanna, but it
is definitley a way to feel hope in
this world despite its imperfections.”

Thursday at 8pm in the 900
Room, for just $3, David Wilcox
gives us a chance to experience
his work and I encourage every-
one to take a break and soak up
his motivational music.

Wilcox also will be giving an in-
terview and performance on
