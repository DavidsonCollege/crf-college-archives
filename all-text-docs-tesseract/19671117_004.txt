bate at the University of
Georgia Novice Debate Tour-
nament last weekend.

Davidson finished fourth

The negative team. Gil Ter-
riberry and Joe Smith, won
four rounds and lost two.

The College of William and
Mary won the tournament,
which included 29 novice de-
bate teams from throughout
the South.

“This was a tough tourna-
ment."' debate coach Ray Mc-
Millin said. ‘I'm very pleased
with the novice. team’s per-
formance. This is only their
third tournament. of the
year.”

Varsity debaters are pre-
paring for their next tourney.
Nov. 30-Dec. 2. The Dixie
Classic at Wake Forest will
feature teams from through.
out the eastern United States.

Tom Wheatley and Mac
Hobby. together with Fietch-
er Hartsell and Windy March,

baters at Wake Forest.

The novice team members
take only one side of the de-
bate topic at their tourna-
ments. while varsity debaters
are required to debate both
sides. ‘

“The varsity should be well

prepared for the Dixie Class- -

ic.’ said McMillin. “The ex-
perience we gained at Em-
ory two weeks ago has helped
us and we've expanded our
research.”

Man Has Lost Style In Life

“Man has lost his style of

Sigma Alpha Epsilon on the
topic of “Order and Society.”

“MacCormac contrasted the

Student Council
Drops Evaluation

The course evaluation
forms which were used both
semesters last year by many
faculty members will not be
provided this year by the
Student Council.

After recommendations
from Sam Darby and Clay
Ford. that. the service be dis-:
continued because it is ‘‘re-
latively useless." the council
voted Monday to abandon the
forms.

The council also continued

discussion on the purpose of
the Committee. for Evaluation
of Rules and Punishments
and elected Mike Carroll.
Woody Faulk and David
Clemmons as __non-council
members of the committee.
‘ After John Williams pre-
sented a report recommend
ing that the evaluation forms
be shortened and used again
this year, Darby and Ford
argued that those professors
who wanted to have their
courses evaluated could pro
vide their own forms.

They said that the student :

response was poor last year
and that a recent survey
among faculty members was
inconclusive. They intimated
that much of the council's
work in this area was being
wasted.

After the. council voted
down the forms, Bill Watson
recommended that a letter
be sent to all faculty mem-
bers explaining in detail why
the council was discontinuing
the service. President Tom
Earnhardt, and Darby drew
up the letter.

Earnhardt suggested  thct
committee on rules and pun.
ishment might consult ‘sever.
al faculty members to help
in preparing their report. He
recommended. that the final
draft of the report be pre-
sented not only to the faculty

Trustees.

He showed several slides
of Mohenjo-daro and of scenes
in the U.S. to illustrate his
lecture. The slides depicting
the plan of Mohenjo-daro
showed that the city streets
were oriented to the points
of the compass.

“The idea was that if you
can capture ine orientation of
the cosmos in the orientation
of your city streets. you can
control the choas outside the
city.’* MacCormac said.

some aerial photographs of

Three Discuss Leadership

By JIM LEE:
Staff Writer

Two members of the col-
lege administration and a
professor agreed that at least
some potential leaders here
never develop.

Jim Terry, assistant dean
of students, Dr. William
Hight, director of student
counseling, and Dr. W. G.
Workman reached a consen-
sus in their opinions in gen-
eral, but each mentioned dif-
ferent peripheral matters re-
lating to student leadership
and frustration.

Terry said that he believed
Davidson upperclassmen had
displayed a genuine interest
by effectively filling positions
of leadership on campus.

He pointed out that although
only a limited number of stu-
dents can obtain these posi-
tions. leadership can be and
is displayed by other mem.
bers of the student body in
other ways.

Terry pointed to student
participation on the Blue Sky
Committee, student presen-
tation of such events as the
“Why War?" series and the
“Blow-Up ‘67° programs
sponsored by Sigma Alpha
Epsilon as cases illustrating
his point.

Terry said that he realized
that at Davidson the excep-
tionally capable student con.
stituted the norm rather than
the exception. He said that
instead of being frustrated
by the competition, many. but
not all, Davidson students

have responded to the chal-
lenge. ;

While a student may have
been a leader in high school.
he comes to Davidson and
realizes that he is in a much
more competitive situation,

look for the lime-green can

where his performance comes
under the close scrutiny of
the students.

The result is the develop-
ment of a “cool” attitude,
Hight said. The student at-
tempts to make acceptable
grades while giving the ap-
Pearance of exerting very
little effort in doing so.

Hight said that all elected
campus leaders do not have
the ability to lead effectively.
However, a part of campus
student activity is maintain-

3 Choirs

A three choir concert of
modern church music this
evening climaxed the opening
day of Davidson's eighth an-
nual Convocation of Sacred
Music.

The concert, held this eve-
ning in the college church,
featured members of the
Trinity Presbyterian Church
choir of Charlotte, the
Queens College Choir and
the Davidson Male Chorus.

Directing the group was
Alec Wyton, past president
of the American Guild of Or-
ganists. His anthem, ‘The
Vision of Isaiah,’’ was one of
the presentations in the con-
cert.

The convocation will con-
tinue tomorrow morning with
a workshop on ‘‘New Ideas
in Church Music.’’ to be led
by Wyton. This will include
a reading through of - new
works and a discussion of
electronic music, serial mu-
sic and other modern tech-
niques with recorded exam
ples.

ed by capable non-elected
leaders, he said.

Workman made a clear dis-
tinction between academic
and extracurricular achieve-
ment. He said that in high
school there normally is a
correlation between the aca-
demically successful and
those capable of assuming
positions of authority.

Since all Davidson students
have intellectual. ability,
leadership must be based on
other criteria, Workman said.

To many students, Work-
man said, learning has be-
come a means rather than an
end—they are primarily mo-
tivated by a desire to receive
recognition and reward for
learning. rather than by the
desire for learning for its
own sake.

In respect to the develop.
ment of leadership. he said
that some students were frus-

FOOTBALL FOR SHUT-INS

At next Saturday’s football game while you are sitting
in your choice student’s seat behind the end zone, won't
you pause and give a thought to football's greatest and,
alas, most neglected name? I refer, of course, to Champert
Sigafoos.

Champert Sigafoos (1714-1928) started life humbly on
a farm near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both
named Walter, were bean-gleaners, and Champert became
a bean-gleaner too. But he tired of the work and went to
Montana where he got a job with a logging firm. Here the
erstwhile bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. After
a month he went to North Dakota where he tended the
furnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted to
Texas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe-wiper). Then to
Arizona where he strung dried fruit (fig-rigger). Then
to Kentucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oat-
toter). Then to Long Island where he dressed poultry
(duck-plucker). Then to Alaska where he drove a delivery
van for a bakery (bread-sledder). Then to Minnesota
where he cut up frozen lakes (ice-slicer). Then to Nevada
where he determined the odds in a gambling house (dice-
pricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted camera
lenses together (Zeiss-splicer).

Finally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a tan-
nery, beating pig hides until they were soft and supple
(hog-flogger). Here occurred the event that changed not
only Champert’s life, but all of ours. .

Next door to Champert's hog-floggery was a mooring
mast for dirigibles. In flew a dirigible one day, piloted by
a girl named Graffa von Zeppelin. Champert watched
Graffa descend from the dirigible, and his heart turned
over, and he knew love. Though Graffa’s beauty was not
quite perfect—one of her legs was shorter than the other
(blimp-gimper) —she was nonetheless ravishing, what
with her tawny hair and her eyes of Lake Louise blue and
her marvelously articulated haunches. Champert, smitten,
ran quickly back to the hog-floggery to plan the wooing.

To begin with, naturally, he would give Graffa a pres-
ent. This presented problems, for hog-flegging, as we all
know, is a signally underpaid profession. Still, thought
Champert, if he had no money, there were two things he
did have: ingenuity and pigskin.

So he selected several high grade pelts and stitched
them together and blew air into them and made for Graffa
a perfectly darling little replica of a dirigible. “She will
love this,” said he confidently to himself and proceeded to
make ready to call on Graffa: ,

irat, of course, he shaved with Personna Super Stain-
less Steel Blades. And wouldn't you? If you were looking
to impress a girl, if you wanted jowls as smooth as ivory,
dewlaps like damask, a chin strokable, cheeks fondlesome,
upper lip kissable, would you not use the blade that
whisks away whiskers quickly and slickly, tuglessly and
nicklessly, scratchlessly and matchlessly? Would you not,
in short, choose Personna, available both in Injector style
and double-edge style? Of course you would.

So Champert, his face a study in epidermal elega:
rushed next door with his little pigekin dirigible But
Graffa, alas, had run off, alas, with a bush pilot who spe-

in dropping limes to scurvy- -

ages (erachuter) , rvy-ridden Eskimo vil

ampert, enraged, started kicking his little pigski
blimp all over the place. And who should walk by juat
then but Jim Thorpe, Knute Rockne, Walter Camp, and
Pete Rozelle! a ,

ey walked silently, heads down, four dis d
men. For weeks they had been trying to invent football,
but they couldn’t seem to find the right kind of ball. They
tried everything—hockey pucks, badminton birds, bowling
balls, quoits—but nothing worked. Now seeing Champert
kicking his pigskin spheroid, their faces lit ‘up and as one
man they hollered “Eureka!” The rest is history.
