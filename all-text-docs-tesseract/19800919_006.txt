Welsh’s Schoolhouse provides culture for the young

By JOHN KROTCHKO
Asst. Features Editor

Whether it's Livingston Tay-
lor or Gertrude Stein, the Ohio
Ballet or Mummenshanz, Ro-
berta Peters or The Police, or
yea, even last year’s Dada Day,
there’s always something with a
cultural twist going on at
Davidson College. You can
almost take it for granted that
the arts are alive and ever-wel-
come on campus.

But there’s a touch of irony
here according to Constance
Welsh, Executive Director of
Davidson's New Schoolhouse of
the Arts (NSA). Welsh says
that for all the College offers to
students and adults, there is
little in the way of culture for
the young minds attending
grade schools in Davidson and
environs.

The Schoolhouse, which be-
gins its fifth year next week at
the Davidson Community Cen-
ter, manifests Mrs. Welsh’s
longtime efforts to bring the
fine arts to children. A former
faculty member of the UNCC
Creative Arts Department,
Welsh has extended experience
in teaching Creative Dramatics
professionally .

When she moved to Davidson
with her family 17 years ago,
she noticed a ‘‘terrible lack’’ of
cultural influence in the public
school system. Seven years
later, in an effort to give her two
children better cultural expo-
sure, she put her talents to
work, recruited other children of
like-minded parents, and or-
ganized her first Children’s
Drama Workshop.

For years she taught itiner-
antly, moving her class from
living room to church basement
tocommunity lodge. Despite
these makeshift conditions, her
classes grew in size and she
invited other teachers into the
workshop.

Then in 1968 integration
emptied the old Ada Jenkins
School as its black students
settled with white students into
the Davidson Elementary
School. Welsh, with parents

Nancy MacCormac and Randy

Kincaid, successfully petitioned
the city to make it a community
center. At last Welsh was
granted a permanent ‘“home”’
for her workshop. C

The NSA still follows the
same philosophy with which
Welsh began. The point is not
to train artists, she explains,
but to let them ‘‘explore,’’ free
from competition, the ‘joy and
fun of the fine arts.

This cause has never been

less.than crucial to her. ‘‘I
believe that the arts are a soul
need,” she said emphatically,
adding that, ‘‘not all children
are book-oriented.’’
’ This semester’s offerings con-
sist of nine twelve-week courses
that meet once or twice a week
for one to two hours. Fare
includes such diverse courses as
Creative Movement, Puppetry,
Painting, and even Suzuki Vio-
lin for pre-schoolers. The
Schoolhouse is offering its’ first
course for adults this year,
Acting.

NSA boasts a professional
staff which operates on a rela-
tively modest income. The
Schoolhouse's biggest expenses
are covered by yearly grants
from The Arts and Sciences
Council of Charlotte.

“ This financial support has
resulted in low fees, which are
adjusted according to family

size and income. A course such
as Art, for example, with all
materials included, may cost as
little as $3 per semester and no
more than $30. Profit is mea-
sured in outreach alone.

Yet even this type of profit
has not completely satisfied
Welsh. She laments that al-
though the NSA could handle
500 students per semester, only
200 are expected next week.
She pointed out that there are
about 5,000 children in Moores-
ville alone. |

Welsh considers Davidson’s

cultural offerings for grade
school aged children minimal
and typical of the Southeast.

Fledgling brass quintet
debuts in Hodson Hall

By NEIL SONDOV
Staff Correspondent

‘‘Carolina Brass,’’ a brass.

instrument quintet consisting
of Davidson music professor
William Lawing and four mem-
bers of the Charlotte Sym-
phony, debuted in Hodson Hall
September 11.

“The first concert was very
important to the five of us.”
commented Professor Lawing.
’We had been rehearsing for the
debut for quite a while, and the
enthusiastic reaction we receiv-
ed was thrilling.”

In addition to Lawing, who

"plays trumpet, the quintet con-

sists of trumpeter Robert Jack-
son, Robert Blalock on: French

horn, Derl Sanderson on trom-

bone, and David Mills on tuba.
The five men have been playing
together for some years, and
decided to begin performing
professionally last spring.

“Once we became really ser-
ious about playing as a quintet,
rehearsal time and places to
perform became difficult to
find.’’ Lawing said. ‘‘We do not
have an agent, so we handle all
those responsibilities ourselves.
It was very time consuming,
yet very rewarding.”

The future of ‘‘Carolina
Brass”’ is not set at the mo-
ment. The quintet does plan to.
continue rehearsing, and is
scheduled to perform on campus
in late spring as part of the
Vesper Concert series.

Welsh predicts that the school
system’s new ‘‘back to basics”
drive will take away even more
arts exposure.

Paula Kelton, a teacher at
Davidson Elementary, agreed,

saying, ‘‘Unfortunately, when
you get back to basics, you
forget the fine arts, which are
considered frills.’’ To Welsh,
however, they are ‘‘an intregal
part of learning.”

Welsh said she is frustrated
by a complete lack of success in
reaching the black community.
Although she regards the col-
lege’s and white community's
‘‘paternalism’’ as cause for a
relatively higher standard of
living among blacks in David-
son, Welsh feels that this same
paternalism has discouraged a
desire among black parents to
have their children culturally
educated.

She illustrated her point by
recalling the year a black teach-
er offered a Black Experience in
Drama course at the NSA.
Registration day came, and no
one signed up.

Welsh would still like to see
black participation in the
NSA—and cites her reasonable
fees as proof—but adds, ‘I’m
not a social worker. I’m an
artist.”’

Welsh recalls without ill will
the lack of tangible support the
College has given NSA. She
seems to think, however, that
correlating the Y Student Ser-
vice Corp’s STEP child tutoring
program with the NSA in some
way would be an excellent
innovation, and she patiently
awaits the innovation.

In the meanwhile, she hopes
that the Schoolhouse will con-
tinue to grow and broaden its
influence. .

Well, who knows? The next
child violinist to play Carnegie
Hall may not be Japanese at all,
but instead might stand up at
the end of the performance and
say to his audience in a strange-
ly familiar accent, ‘‘Thank
y’all!”’
