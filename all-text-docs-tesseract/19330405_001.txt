BEARD TALKS ON MODERN
THOUGHTS ABOUT HISTORY

ieee of David- |

Students and faculty
son enjoyed the privilege of hearing a very |
interesting lecture, given by Mr. Charles A.
Beard, one of the most prominent historians |
in the United States, on Wednesday, March |
29, in Chambers Auditorium. The subject of |
the lecture was “Contemporary Thought
About History.”

Mr. Beard was introduced by Professor |
John P. Williams, who has long been a per- |
sonal friends of the noted scholar.
sor Williams presented Mr. Beard as a teach-|
er, administrator, adviser, and writer. He
told of the international reputation and the
widespread interests of the speaker, who is
the author of many of our best textbooks
on history. Mr. Beard, he said, is one-of the
few men today who are willing to defend
their beliefs in the face of strenuous oppo-

sition. Professor Williams also expressed _the,

enthusiasm with which Davidson greeted the

long hoped-for visit of Mr. Beard.
Mr. Beard announced that his lecture
would concern “Contemporary Thought |

About History.” Before beginning, he made
a special point to differentiate between con-
temporary thought and modern thought,
which are often confused. History, he said,
has three aspects: (1) history which is actu-
ality; (2) history which is record; and (3) |
history which thought about the other
two aspects of history. The first group in-
cludes everything thought, said, or done. It |
includes all the sciences, arts, etc, Out of |
this group are made all departnients of
thought. The second group includes all doc-
uments in history. The third group is made
up of all men’s thoughts about history.

The speaker explained that written history
is thought about history, which thought in-
evitably changes. He announced that the!
purpose of his lecture was to sketch the |

Debating Team

The varsity debating team, composed
of Gordon H. Brown, Leland McKeith-
an, and Tom Caldwell, which set out
on a northern trip last Friday, should
soon be returriing from what started
out as a very successful trip.

By the latest report received from
the debaters, the University of Rich-
mond lost the decision to Davidson’s
orators last Friday night. The judges
awarded the verdict to the Davidson
team by a unanimous vote. \

Continuing the trip north, the var-
sity met the Rutgers University team
Monday night, and Haverford College
Tuesday in an Oxford style debate. No
verdict was’ rendered at the conclu-
sion of this novel style debate. The
decision of the Rutgers debate was
not known at the time of publication
of this issue.

Tomorrow, the Davidson team will
meet Bucknell University, thus com-
pleting the northern trip, and will re-
turn Sunday. In all this series of de-
bates, Davidson has taken the nega-
tive. The subject discussed was: “Re-
solved: That the United States should
cancel the Inter-Allied war debts.”
