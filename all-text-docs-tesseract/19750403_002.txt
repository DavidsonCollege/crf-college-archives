Scott rejects changes in ARA services
following proposal toclose Rusk House

By MATTHEW COVINGTON

Director of ARA Food Ser-
vices Ron Scott, in conference
with administrators, ARA
Slater executives, and David-
son students, decided not to
change the food service at
Davidson drastically during.the
remainder of the present
academic. year.

The decision came after Scott
had suggested that he would
close Rusk House immediately
to fight his existing revenue
deficit of $10,000. :

“It’s a bite the bullet
situation,”’ said Scott.

Scott had suggested Monday
that he would be forced to resort
to one of three.alternatives if he
were to meet his budget for the
1974-75 school year.

He had suggested one of the
following three proposals:

1.) An across the board 10 per- |

cent price increase on all food.

2.) An elimination of
unlimited portions at Rusk
House. with a _ simultaneous
price range increase from 25 to
30 cents a meal.

3.) An immediate closing of
Rusk House as a dining facility.

Scott indicated that he
favored the third proposal, the

closing: of Rusk House as the
best alternative.

“The expected savings for
closing Rusk House are $700 a
week. We would maintain the
help that has been with us the
longest, but the more recent
workers would be laid off. This
would effect three people. The
same plan applies to student
help. We would lay off two stu-
dents,’’ Scott explained.

The duplication of facilities
and labor in running three in-
dividual dining houses are the
basis of Scott’s financial
problems.

In addition, the all-you-can-
eat plan at Rusk House, with
costs estimated at one-and-one-
half portions per person, has
been operating at a 90 percent
food cost rather than the projec-
ted 50 percent.”

‘‘Bailey and Richards Houses

are having to subsidize Rusk,”’
Scott said.
“By offering longer hours at the
other two houses, we could ac-
comodate the people who now
eat at Rusk.”’

Following college ad-
ministration objection to Scott’s
proposals and student disfavor,
Scott abandoned his ideas for
meeting his budget.

“After talking with my bosses

at ARA, the college and studen-
ts. we’ve decided not to do
anything now.

“We'll continue as we are
through this year and do the
best, we can to operate, We’ll
just try to come out ahead next
year,’’ Scott said.
