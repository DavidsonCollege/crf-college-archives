Kellogg Elected

Last Monday the track squad
elected Robert O. Kellogg of
Brooklyn, N. Y., to captain Da-
vidson’s track team for the 1940
season.

A member of the track and
cross-country teams for the past
three years, Captain-elect Kel-
logg has been turning in con-
sistently good miles all season.
As a freshman he won the an-
nual cake race, but the next
spring a bad heart forced him
to drop track—fortunately only
temporarily. Last fall he alter-
nated with Gammon for third
and fourth slots on the cross-
country team.

Kellogg is secretary and treas-
urer of the “D” club and a mem-
ber of Phi Gamma Delta social
fraternity. He belongs to Alpha
Phi Epsilon, honorary forensic
fraternity. He succeeds T. E.
Walker, ace 880 man.
