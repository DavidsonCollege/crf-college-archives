SAT Scores
on the Rise

CPS—Standardized test scores for
college-bound seniors rose again after a
19-year decline, but educators are still
uncertain what caused the two-decade
decline or why this year’s scores sud-
denly went up.

When test scores leveled out one
year ago, experts were hopeful then that
it signaled an upturn in the long-running
decline, but few were ready to predict
scores would increase this year.

Yet performances on a variety of
standardized tests—the Scholastic Apti-
tude Test (SAT), the Test of Standard
Written English, and the 15-subject
College Board Achievement Tests—in-
dicate test scores may finally be on the
path to recovery, the College Board re-
ports.

“This year’s rise, combined with
last year’s holding steady, is a welcome
sign for educators, parents, and students
that sreious efforts by the nation’s

schools and their students to improve
the quality of education are taking ef-
fect,” says George Hanford, president
of the College Board.

Hanford remains non-commital,
however, on whether the rise is an ongo-
ing trend or only a temporary interrup-
tion in the test score decline which be-
gan in 1963.

_ “There are several signs we think
are encouraging,” notes Fred Moreno,
spokesman for College Board. Teachers
have been reporting for some time that
students are more interested in academ-
ic subjects and in good grades. And we
know that the class of ’82 had more
math and physical science courses than
ever before. Since most of the tests deal
with these subjects, we think students
were better prepared to answer the ques-
tions in these areas.” ,

Schools have also “tightened up in
terms of basic academics,” says Dr.
Larry Loesch, president of the Associa-
tion for Measurement and Evaluation in
Guidance. ,

“T think there’s a growing emphasis
on __ traditional + §academics—math,

. science, and English—from the ‘back to

basics’ movement,” Loesch says. “In
the *60s and ’70s, we had a more liberal
attitude towards education. But as times

have gotten tougher we’ ve moved back
to traditional courses.”

Indeed, a recent study from the Uni-
versity of Iowa noted that in larger high
schools where. more traditional courses
were offred, students also scored higher
on standardized tests such as the SAT.

U:-S: Arboretum
Director to Visit

ered

United States National Arboretum
Director Dr. Marc Cathey will visit Da-
vidson College on 12 October to present
a Slide show and lecture titled, ““A Capi-
tal Experience,” which begins at 8:15
p.m. in Love Auditorium.

During his visit, Cathey will also
give the College 1,000 seeds from Ja-
pan’s famed Yoshino cherry trees.

The seeds—the first to be distribut-
ed by Cathey and his staff—are part of a
gift of one million such seeds gathered
last summer by Japanese schoolchild-
ren. He plans to distribute the seeds
from Michigan to Northern Florida. In

return, Cathey has asked American
schoolchildren to collect a million dog-
wood seeds this fall to be sent to Japan.

The cherry trees will begin to bloom

in three or four years and will reach full -

maturity in eighteen to twenty years.

A native of Davidson, Cathey at-
tended Davidson College and graduated
from N. C. State University. He holds
master’s and doctoral degrees from Cor-
nell University and joined USDA as a
research horticulturist in 1956. Cathey
is.well known for his televised horticul-
tural presentations and has been a fre-
quent guest on NBC’s “Today Show.”
