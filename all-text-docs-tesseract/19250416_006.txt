THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 16, 1925

Wildcats to Meet

Jacket Golf Team

The Davidson golf team will meet Georgia
Tech in a match today at the Charlotte
Country Club. The teams will consist of
five men each. Eighteen holes will be play-
ed in the morning and eighteen in the aft-
ernoon. The Tech team has several stars on
it and the Wildcats will have to fight hard
to defeat them. :

The Davidson team will consist of Reeves,
Milhous, Jones, Trotter, and Malloy. There
is a possibility that Malloy will be unable to
play as the track team meets South Carolina
in Columbia the same date and Malloy is a
member of both teams. If he is unable to
play the teams will probably only consist of
four men, The Tech team has two strong
men in Rip Farnsworth and Bill Spalding,
who. have proven their ability many times
over,
pion, is also on the team and should prove a
hard man for anyone. There is a chance
that Johnny Bachman, who attended David-
son last fall, will also play against the Wild-
cats.

DAVIDSON NINE TO PLAY IN
GREENSBORO TODAY

The Wildcat baseball nine traveled to
Greensboro this morning to encounter the
Duke University team this afternoon. This
is the first game between the two teams this
season and will be hotly contested as are all

the athletic contests between these two in-!

stitutions,

The State nine, which beat Davidson only |

a few days ago, also defeated Duke by a
closer margin than the Davidson-State game.
Wake Forest has also defeated the Wild-
cats and Duke. The Duke nine beat Elon in
their only victory, while Davidson has been
unable to scratch on the winning side of the
score book, The Wildcats will fight hard to
score their first win of the season and Duke
Will put up a strong showing to keep the
baseball team from being the third aggre-
gation representing Davidson to defeat Duke
this year,

The team made the trip this morning in a
large safety bus.
after the game. Approximately 14 players,

Coach Monk and Manager Briggs made the

trip.
