few years, if that was agreeable to all
parties concerned. The Reserve Officers’

| Alumni Deaths

ROBERT F. PHIFER, ’69

Robert F. Phifer, '69, native of Con-
cord, but for many years a resident of
New York City, died Tuesday, October
17, at Battle Creek, Mich., where he
had been for about a year undergoing
treatment. The body was brought to
Concord where interment occurred.

Mr. Phifer was 79 years old, and a
member of one of the best known
families in this section of the state.
He had extensive real estate holdings
Concord and other of
North Carolina and was a large stock-
holder in the Southern Railway Co.

The deceased entered Davidson from
Concord in 1862, but did not graduate.
While here he was a member of the
Philanthropic society. He left here
and began his career as a planter and
cotton buyer in Winston-Salem, later
transferring his interests to New York.

In commenting on his death the
Charlotte Observer remarked: “Old
days in Concord and old memories of
the town and its departed citizenship
are. recalled with information of the
death of Mr. Robert Phifer. * * * Mr.
Phifer was representative of the or-
iginal stock of Concord citizenship, be-
ing the son of a man who was a con-
temporary of the pioneer families who
were commercial kings of Concord
and the agricultural leaders of Ca-
barrus, all associated citizens in the in-
tegrity of the community and royalty
of the pioneer days. Mr. Phifér was
a man of genial traits of character.
He was one of the best types of ‘the

Big Scores

East Lansing, Mich., Oct. 24—(1P)—
Michigan State University’s gridders
have made an early bid for recogni-
tion as high scorers in the 1928 foot-
ball by defeating Kalamazoo
College 103 to @ This is the highest
score which has been made this year
by a well-known college or university

season

eleven.

The highest score in one game made
last season was credited to St. Xavier,
at Cincinnati, which defeated Lee Uni-
versity, in Kentucky, to the merry
tune of 132 to 0, a score estimated to
be about the limit possible in a regu-
lation time game.

St. Xavier last year piled up a total
of 411 points, granting their oppo-
nents only 64. The team won eight
games, tied one 6 to 6, and lost one
I4 to 13. :

St. Xavier last year defeated West-
ern Reserve University at Cleveland
53 to 7, the latter team turning about
early this season and whipping Kenyon
College 70 to 6,

Onty twice before in the history of
the college has Michigan State piled up
such. scores, once in 1912 when it de-
feated Hillsdale College 104 to 0, and
in 1920 when it walked over Olivet
College 108 to o.

Smith and his brown derby—Hoover
and his brown study.

A leading New York journal recently
published an article giving the opinions
of college executives regarding tem-
perance conditions jamong_ students.
Excerpts from some of the opinions
were as follows:

President A. A. Brown, University
of Chattanooga: “To my mind, the
conditions with reference to drinking
among college students are better than
they were in the pre-prohibition times.”

President R. L. Wilbur, Stanford
University: “There is'‘no doubt that
there has been a marked decrease in
the use of alcoholic beverages among
the college students with whom I come
in contact. Compared with the period
before the present laws were put into
effect, I should say that we have only
one-tenth of the problem that we had
at that time in connection with liquor.”
- “A changed mental attitude, which
has brought university students to the
realization that ‘gentlemen don't get
drunk,” is the outstanding effect of
prohibition noted on the University of
Iowa campus by R. E, Reinaw, dean of
men for 15 years,

In a column adjacent to these state-
ments was a news article telling of the
death of two day students of New
York University caused by the Grink-
ing of liquor. How do drinking condi-
tions on the college campus before
prohibition compare with conditions as
they are today?
