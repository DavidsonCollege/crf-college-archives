AN UPSETTING DAY AT THE FIELD
Confusion reigns in freshman flickerball.

Far From The Madding Crowd

The crowds at Davidson’s soccer matches nie
dwindling constantly, angehave reached the point where
only a handful of students, STEP tutees, a few faculty
members and the coach’s wife show up to watch the
game.

Occasionally a few football players cease their
wind sprints long enough to cast a glance at the match,
and a cross country runner or two happens by every
so often.

But for the most part, no one comes to Davidson
soccer games. And it seems strange, especially since
the team has a winning season and has a good chance
at the Southern Conference crown.

| guess it’s only natural. Crowds have been bad for
two years, and anything that happens for two years
around Davidson becomes a tradition.

But the team keeps improving, and being made up
of mostly freshmen and sophomores, future hopes are
extremely bright. So it seems a real pity that students
can’t find time to support the squad.

Soccer is growing in America at,a tremendous
rate. Crowds at professional soccer games this summer
surpassed most of the baseball attendance marks, and
more and more high school conferences are adding
soccer to. their fall sports picture.

At some colleges the turnouts for soccer rival
other sports in size. When Davidson played at Belmont
Abbey two weeks ago, over 1,000 students jammed
the sidelines to see the Abbey play. The Abbey is un-
defeated this year, and Davidson almost won. Certainly
the team deserves better than 10 or 15 students at its

home stands.

After all, Davidson soccer is exciting.

There's Cliff Patterson, who seems to be able to
stop the ball no matter where it is on the field or how
fast it’s going.

There’s Bill Horton, and there’s Roger Peterson;
the former a sharp-shooter with power in his toes, the
latter a dribbler who leaves defenders sprawled all
over the field. ;

Then there always is a freak play or two to spice
up the game-plays like Dave Dilley’s head-shot goals
or Alex Neisler’s bounce-it-off-the-defender’s-back

‘slam shots. .

To add flavor to the game, there’s “Salt” and
“Pepper.” The names belong to the small men, John
Bruner and Randy Carter. Bruner intercepted a pass
from a fullback to a goaligfa few weeks back and walk-

ed it into the goal.
The team plays tomorrow morning. The outcome

could decide the conference title. So why not go out
and watch. It could be a rare opportunity to see a win-
ning Davidson team in action.

BERRY POLL
IMAC ANALYSIS
By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor

Phi Delts

The Phi Delts continue to
roll on undefeated in IMAC
flickerball, although they sur-
vived a scare by the Pikas
last. week, 14-13. The Delts’
main strength is defense, and
they lead the league with the
least points scored against
them per game. The key to
the defense has been the fine,
made up of rusher Bill Trax-
fer and ends Hartan Day and
mammouth John McCammon.
Frank Murphy stands out in
the defensive backfield.

The Delts are almost as
good at scoring points as at
preventing them. They are
second in the league in this
category. Tailback Jack Caild-
well and a tricky play selec-
tion keep the offense moving.

Sigma Nu

The story of Sigma Nu in
this flickerball season has
been Bruce Weidner. Without.
Weidner the Nus are just a
fairly good flickerball team.
With him they are great.

With Weidner passing to
‘Steve Hayes, Toby West-
moreland. Tom Skinner, Dale
Vash, and John Lambert, the
Nus have mounted an explo-
sive offense. Perhaps the of-
fense’s only real weakness
has been a tendency to rely
on the long pass to too large
an extent. This weakness
was particularly noticeable
in- the loss to the Pikas, the
only team to beat the Nus
with Weidner playing.

The only other real weak
ness of the Nus is a, lack of
depth. .With most players
forced to go both ways, they
tire easily in the game.

Kappa Sigs

Offense is the word to de-
scribe the Kappa Sig flicker-
ball team. They easily lead
the league in points scored
per game. With Terry Millar

The team was stalemated
by a rugged defense which

like Greg Cox, the Sigs have
bullt a potent attack which
has scored over 30 points
seven times thus far. Their
biggest point output was in a
72-12 dance over the Pi
Kapps.

The defense of the Sigs has
been more than adequate.
They are second in the league
in fewest number of points
scored against them per
game. Their biggest problem
this year has been Bruce
Weidner.

Sigma Chi

Sigma Chi has a young but
good team, consistent on of-
fense and steady on defense.
However, their offense is not
quite potent enough and their
defense is not quite tight
enough to beat the top teams
in the league.

The key to the Machi of
fense has been tailback Pete
Norton. He is tricky and sets
up most of the Machis’ suc-
cessful plays with an initial
dodge of the rusher.

Most of the other Machi
players are sophomores. Herb
Clegg. John Saunders. and
Doug Haynes are some of the
better ones.

Pikas

The Pikas have come on
strong this season behind a
containing defense and have
given the top feams in ‘the
league all they could handle.
The Pikas came the closest
of anyone to beating the Delts
and are the only team to beat

The top players for the

Ken Crews, Bud Couser. and

ATO’s

The ATO’s could have been
high in the final flickerball
standings if their defense had
developed. Unfortunately for
them, the defense has not
been strong. In fact, only the
hapless Pi Kapps and Inde-
pendents have allowed more
points per game.

The offense has been rela-
tively good, however, and has
enabled the ATO’s to do as
well as they have. Mark

players.

tively strong. The Gamms
have been beaten badly only
once, and only two teams
have managed to score more
than 20 points against them.

Sig Eps

The Sig Eps have used a
large number of sophomores
and juniors to put together
one of their better flickerball
teams of recent years.

The SPE's do indeed have
a poor record, but no team
has really run over them.
Tailback Gary Sigmon and
halfback Jim Cantrell lead
what could be a good offense
if more speed were present.
Speed is also a problem on
on defense.

KA‘s
The KA’s are the big disap-
pointment of the league this
season, after winning last
year’s championship. Neither
the offense nor the defense

has been particularty good,
‘as the KA’s rank near the

bottom of the league in both
categories.

Romey Fisher, the tailback
and one of two returnees from
last year's team. is a fine
passer, but he has a definite
lack of good receivers. Nel-
son Abell. the other returneée,
anchors the defense. but
there is no other help there
either. Even the return of
Dave Dunn to the starting
lineup after being red-shirted
last year failed to strengthen
the team.

Indies

This looks like the year the
Indies will finally climb out
of the cellar and win a game.
When they have all _ their
players, the Indies are actual-
ly a presentable team.

The offensive is fair. but
the defense needs lots of
work. More speed is needed,

backfield.

Pi Kapps

it is difficult to find ad-
jectives to describe the Pi
Kapp flickerball team. In
the first place, very few peo-
ple have ever seen the team
in action, for rarely do they
show up for thelr games.

When they have played it
has been somewhat of a car- ;
nival affair. The Pi Kapps
combine the worst offense.
the worst defense. and quite
appropriately the worst rec-
ord in the league. They aver-
age 6 points per game while
their opponents average 50.
Yes, that is 50. To. avoid em-
barrassment, no names of
members of the team will be
mentioned.
