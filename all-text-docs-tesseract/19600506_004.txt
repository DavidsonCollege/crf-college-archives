“You are not allowed to prac-

dent of Judo must not only
know how to fall, but must know
how to revive an opponent
should he lose consciousness.”
“Judo was introduced to Ja-
pan by a Chinese in the seven-
teenth century ... experts then

¥ Clothing Drive

Starting the ninth and run.'

the YMCA will conduct its an-
