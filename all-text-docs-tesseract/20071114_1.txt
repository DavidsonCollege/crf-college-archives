global perspectives on philanthro-
py in the non-profit sector during a

Associate Professor of Political
Science Ken Menkhaus, President
Tom Ross and Tim Ogden ’95
spoke on the trends and challenges
within the field.

Menkhaus will teach his course,
“Philanthropy in the Non-Profit

Menkhaus spoke first to frame
the broader issue.

He defined the difference
between philanthropy and the non-
profit sector by saying that “one
gives and one receives.”

Non-profit organizations are pri-
vate and self-governing. They
serve a public good by raising
money or seeking government
funds.

According to Menkhaus, the
downside of these organizations is
that some “promote their narrow
interests at the expense of the larg-
er good.”

Non-profit organizations today
face greater pressure to raise
money and produce measurable
results for their donors. There is
also a corporate approach to man-
aging these organizations.

Menkhaus said that another
characteristic of the non-profit sec-
tor today is the “blurring of the line
between the non-profit sector, the
for-profit sector and the govern-
ment sector.”

According to Menkhaus, these
partnerships provide opportunities
for non-profits to become more
sustainable.

Indian festival celebrated with

food, fun and performances

By Curis Moore
News Editor

Last weekend, Davidson stu-
dents joined together to celebrate
Diwali, a festive, Indian holiday.

Diwali has historically been a
religiously significant event in
Hinduism and other Indian faiths,
such as Janism and Sikhism .
Today it is celebrated by Hindus,
Jains, and Sikhs across the globe as
the “Festival of Light,” where the
lights or lamps signify the victory
of good over evil within every
human being.

The Sanskrit word “Deepavali”
means an array of lights that stands
for the victory of brightness over
darkness.

In India, Diwali is now consid-
ered to be a national festival, and
most Indians enjoy the aesthetic
aspect of the festival, regardless of
faith.

Over the course of the five-day
festival, homes are thoroughly
cleaned and windows are opened to
welcome the goddess of wealth.
Candles and lamps are then lit as a
greeting to Laksmi, gifts are

exchanged and festive meals are -

prepared.

As a part of the college celebra-
tion, a group of Davidson students
went to the’ Hindu Center in
Charlotte on Saturday. Interfaith
organized the trip

Mr. Thakur Topiwalla, a teacher
at the center, met with the students
and showed them around.

On Sunday, Curry Club,
Interfaith and the Asian Cultural
Awareness Association organized a
Diwali celebration on campus.

Approximately 130 students,
faculty and community members
attended the event, which began
with an interactive ritual demon-
stration in which students gave
offerings of flowers, rice and
sweets to the deities.

It continued with Indian snacks,
chai and a classical/devotional
dance performance by artist Pallavi
Penumetcha.

Nafisa Isa ’08, one of the student
leaders behind the event, said, “We
tried to incorporate basic elements
of Diwali, such as the religious rit-
uals, candles and flowers into our
celebration.

“We also wanted to add more
celebratory elements, ones that are
feasible at Davidson, such as
Pallavi Penumetcha’s dance per-
formance, food, and folk dancing.”

Isa, who is Muslim, said, “I like
the idea of helping promote inter-
faith awareness and understanding
at Davidson.”

“As President of the Muslim
Students Association,” she added,
“I was very impressed by the num-
ber of non-Muslim people who
helped us make the Fast-a-thon a
success earlier in the semester, and
I think both these events indicate
the amount of cooperation among
students of different faiths at
Davidson.”

Isa added that she was “really
glad we. were able to hold this
event on the Courtyard of the new
Duke Dormitory. It’s a great central
location on campus and I hope that
more international-oriented events
take place there in the future. “

Former head of USAID talks foreign policy

By Monica JAMOUNEAU
News Editor

In the second Bank of America
lecture on Nov. 7, Andrew Natsios,
former Administrator of the United
States Agency for International
Development (USAID), spoke at
length about the United States’
approach to international develop-
ment.

Natsios, who held his post at
USAID from 2001 until 2005, is
now a Professor of International
Studies at Georgetown University,
his alma mater. He received his
Masters of Public Administration
from Harvard.

For the last 18 years, Natsios has
been involved in international
assistance work and in 2006, he
served as special envoy to Sudan,
where he focused on the crisis in
Darfur. He has written two books
on American foreign policy.

Natsios began his lecture on
Wed. night by recalling a fateful
meeting in September 2001, when
he was called into Condoleezza
Rice’s office to discuss what he

called a “radical shift:” an increase
in the importance of international
development to American foreign
policy.

For the first time in history, the
U.S. had a development officer
write the national security strategy
following 9/11.

“America is no longer threatened
principally by strong states but by

a

PRON vb

weak states,” Natsios said, explain-
ing how leaders such as Osama Bin
Laden could have such a strong
affect from third world nations like
Afghanistan.

It is these “ungoverned spaces,”
Natsios said, to which we should
pay attention. There are now 42 of
them according to the Pentagon,
