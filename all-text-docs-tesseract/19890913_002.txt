history.”

Immediately following the meeting‘s
adjournment, Helms talked to The
Davidsonian about minorities at
Davidson. Asked about the SGA’s po-
sition on this issue, Helms stated that,
because it affects all students, a lot of
concern is being raised by the student
body--minorities as well as non-mi-
norities. SGA will “determine what the
problemsare and identify which can be
addressed by students,” said Helms.

Asked if there is racism at Davidson,
Helms candidly replied “yes.”

“A lotof it has to do withignorance,”
he said. According to Helms, the SGA
has already begun reducing ignorance
by creating the ad hoc Student Minor-

Also discussed was junior Class
President Josh Hickman’s concern that
some rising juniors will be able to draw
senior lottery numbers next spring.’
These rising juniors were moved from
Knox to Belk this summer as a result of
a housing crunch. Hickman’s primary
worry is that these 12 rising juniors will
have access to senior apartments.
Senior Class President William
Brewer expressed students’ difficulties
with the CAT cards. Students feel the
initial $5 fee is unfair because the card
itself already benefits the college mone-
tarily. Another difficulty with the card
is that refunds on the remaining bal-
ance take up to three months to receive.
Along with the minority situation,
Helms identified student health issues-
-specifically AIDS, condoms and
health education--and campus security
as the three main issues facing SGA in

1989-90.
