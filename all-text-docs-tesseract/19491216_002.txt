The: Football Poll

The recent poll uf the student body in chapel brought some
very interesting coment as well as the anticipated answers to
the questions.

First, let us hasten to explain the purpose %£ the question-
naire. Its main purpose was to stimulate interest in the student
bods and to arouse the latent protests which rested in that group
concerning athletics at Dav idson. Secondly, it was designed to
prove to certain elements among the hierarchy that the students
do not have the one-sided view of stressing all athletics at the
exclusion of academic rating.

From the answers to the poll and the comments received,
it is evident that the student body realizes that a college’s first
daty is scholastic. But at the same time the students were very
outspoken in pointing out that academic standard does not
have to be sacrificed in order to have an athletic program.

The questions were deliberately worded in a one-side man.
ner. One could not take a middle of the road course in answer-
ing. He either had to appear to be all out for athletics or he had
to vote for a curtailed athletic program in order to maintain
Davidson’s scholastic prestige. The answers were obvious to
the pollsters when the questionnaire was made. These answers
were also obvious to a large part of the student body and for
that reason seemed very silly.

We feel that the poll has served its purpose in that it has
created a great deal of interest and has shown student views
pretty well..However the way in which the questions were
worded has rather over: emphasized the academic viewpoint.

The idea that the two views could live together prevailed |’

throughout the comments. This is the point that should be
stressed.

A check of the records in the registrar’s office will show
that the averace grades of members of any athletic team is
higher than the average grades of the student body. No one
may participate on a Davidson team unless his grades are above
any danger of failure. There is at Davidson no set courses de’
signed to keep poor struggling athletes from flunking out. At
some schools a ball player can take physical education courses,
forestry, animal husbandry, ete. He will get a liberal arts di-
ploma without ever seeing an English or a math book.

But: not so here. Everyone must take the required courses
his first two years. If he can not pass them, he flunks out re-
gardless of who he may be. For this reason, if none other,
Davidson's academic standards will never be lowered because
of athletics.

There is another reason. The faculty has the final word
on all admissions to Davidson College. No matter how much
alumni pus! a boy, or how good a football player he may be, the
faculty will not adinit him if he is not prepared to stand David-
son's curriculum.

Below are ihe results of the football questionnaire :

1. Do you favor: (check one)

(a) Continuation ‘of present policy of limited subsidiza-
tion program—9 per cent.

(b) Largest and most complete policy possible at risk
of curtailing building and educational program—10 per
cent.

(c) Largest and most complete policy possible without
making use of furds alloted for academic and construc-
tional improvenenis—81 per cent.

2. Would you prefer that Davidson be best known for its:
{cheek one)

(a)—Athletic standing—1l1 per cent.
(b)—Academic rating—62 percent.
(c)—Both—27 per cent.

& In your opinion: (answer yes or no)

(a)—Does Davidson's merit asa college hinge upon the
calibre of its football team: Yes, 21 per cent; No, 89
per cent.

(b)—Would the acquisition of a winning team necessarily
jeopardize Davidson's academic standing: Yes, 3 per
cent; No 97 per cent.

(e)—Is a first class team an essential element in making
Davidson an outstanding educational institution: Yes
39 per cent; No 61 per cent.

+L Of the following, which would most interest you in re-
turning to Davidson Homecoming after graduation :
(check one)
(a)—Renewal of old student friendships—42 per cent,
(b)—Visiting friends among the faculty—1 per cent.
(c)—Seeing the campus and visiting library, Chambers,
dormitories, science building, gymnasium, and fraternity
houses—4 per cent.
(a)—Prospect of watching a spirited Davidson team in
action—38 per cent.

(e)-—-Combination—15 per cent. —J. H.

The Darker Side

By DON W. SHRIVER

A recent ad in a church paper
describes Davidson as “A Strong
Arm of the Church.’’, Most people
do indeed identify Davidson with
the Church, but some do so not to
Davidson's credit. To them the
Church is something between a
company of well-meaning  do-
gooders and a safe refuge for the
unprogressive.

This type critic usually believes
that society needs changing and
that Church people are uninterested
in changes. We do not mect him
often at Davidson. But every now
and then we run across the proof
texts of his criticism. For example,
at the most recent meeting of the
Synod of South Carolina this reso-
lution was adopted: “We believe
that genuine Christian capitalism
is the trie biblical doctrine regard-
ing possessions.’

To this ine critic is likely to
reply, “Peddling into your ‘King-
dom’ on a capitalistic vehicle is
putting a lot of stock on one means
of transportation.”

The Church has its other spokes-
men, of course, In his provocative
chapel talk, Dr. R. J. McMullen
recently said that the Church
means to support Christian colleges
in China hot as bulwarks of the

‘American government or American

capitalism, but as expressions. of
a Christian concern for PEOPLE
—Communists or what-have-you.

We who have so often been
dubbed “future leaders of the
Church” have discussed the ques-
tion from bull session to bull ses-

sion: At what’ point should the
Christian Church cease being leaven
and become part of the lump?

When _ shall society » reflect the
Church, and when the Church
society?

While we ponder, the critic con-
tinues: »“You go about thinking
that vou’re the leaven in the lump
when other people are really pro-
ducing the ferment, Your theme
almost is:

‘Come weal, come woe,

My status is quo.’
The churchman speaks of brother-
hood.. So does the labor unionist.
Infact, down South unions have
found that Negro men HAVE to
organize with white for the union
to be effective. But a colored man
walks into one of your churches
and you ask him to sit in the bal-
cony.”

Anyone in Davidson concerned
for the Church will probably be
concerned with this critic, utili-
tarian and visionary as he. may be.
Some may even borrow one of the
critic’s graces: the grace of im-
patience. They may believe firmly
in the Church and its Gospel and
still be disturbed at the degree of
truth in such statements as Eleton
Trueblood’s: “Once a church was
a brave and revolutionary fellow-
ship, changing the course of his-
tory by the introduction of dis-
cordant ideas; today it is a place
where people go and sit on com-
fortable benches, waiting patient-
ly until time to go home to their
Sunday dinners.”

This Day In Time

By C. J.

Great men make great colleges,
and great colleges make great men,
The process goes on and on in an
cndless cycle, with individuals and
organized society reaping the great
benefits.

It would have warmed the heart
of all good citizens to have wit-
nessed the demonstration of this
truism last Thursday night at the
Davidson College alumni dinner in
the Seminole Hotel. And it would
have provided them with a much-
needed boost in their confidence
in the security of American ‘ideals
and principles. It would have given
them’ assurance that there are still
strongholds in America’s educa-
tional system that cannot be pene-
trated by that evil element that
carries on its ceaseless attack
against this Nation's cherished in-
stitutions under the guise of
“academic freedom.’’

Davidson's glorious place in the
educational progress of America
was paraded before the alumni,
parents of the college’s students,
and friends that all might sce and
evaluate its great worth—worth to
the cause of education, to the Na-
tion as a whole, but particularly
to the Southeast, with special em-
phasis on Florida.

The spirit of the alumni t was aptly
expressed by Joseph McConnell,
who came all the way from New
York City, to have his say.

Mr. McConnell, who was reared
at Davidson, where his father was
for a long time dean of the faculty,
and married Miss Elizabeth Bar-
nard of Jacksonville, daughter of
the late D. Meade Barnard, a be-
loved educator of this city for many
years,

After practicing law briefly in
West Palm Beach, he went to
Washington for a couple of years,
then to New York City where re-
cently he became president of the
National Broadcasting Company.

It is obvious, therefore, that he
is an extremely busy executive, but
not too busy to take time out to
pay tribute to his Alma Mater,
and to do his part in raising a
$2,500,000 development fund in
order that the school may broaden
its services to the young men of
America and especially to those
of the Southeast.

And what -does this still com-
paratively young business executive
think of Davidson? The answer
to this question gives penetrating
insight into the chamcter and great-
ness of the school. He says:

“The student gets from David-
son spiritual entity.’’

This statement is supported with
these additional unqualified words:

“No greater thing can be done
for anyone than Davidson does for
its students.”

Full appreciation of Mr. McCon-
nell’s opinion may be realized only

when the definition of the word | on the days of visiting speakers,

K., SR.

“entity” is understood.

Entity is defined by Webster as
“being, existence’? It means “a
real being : .. that which has reali-
ty and distinctiveness.” °

It is seen, therefore, that the
student who stays at Davidson for
his four-year course comes away
with the most cherished possession
that is achievable by man—"a
spiritual being.’’

How this is done is another
story. Suffice it to say for thie
recital that the two-year course in
the Bible that every student must
take is probably responsible for it.
For as one graduate of Davidson
says, “that intensive course in the
Bible does something to you.” Ad-
ditional evidence is the great num-
ber of ministers turned out by
Davidson.

Is it any wonder therefore, that
the educational foundations—-those
agencies that are handling huge
sums of money left by wealthy men
to be given to ‘worthy iristitutions

Jefferson Military Academy, a
small (48 students) bankrupt mili-
tary school in Washington, Mis-
sissippi, recently turned down a
gift of $50 million offered by mil-
lionnaire George W.- Armstrong,
because it did not care to accept
the teaching of white supremacy
as the foundation of the college
curriculum. Since that time the
academy has received more than
$5,000 in gifts, including a gift of
ten dollars from a 72-year-old
paralytic Negress (daughter of a
slave) who hobbled up to the col-
lege to make her gift...

According to the National Stu-
dent Association News, college ad-
ministrators are tightening up on
alcoholic regulations, and for good
reasons: 1, Students were getting
younger on the average: 2. A Ohio
State University student com-
mented that “When I get drunk, I
get trigger-happy” after shooting a
fraternity brother during an illegal
party; 3. Chemistry-wise students
at Purdue University were attenipt-
ing to boot-leg their own concoc-
tions.’’ Brown University officials
cracked down on its rule barring
alcohol from the campus, and the
Harvard “Crimson” prophesied the
downfall of Brown fraternities with
the removal of the bars. The dean
of the University of Michigan con-
ducted an “If I were Dean’’ con-
test to secure suggestions, but few
students seemed to indicate that
they would like the job...

Christian Pfohl.

Reading, we believe, should give
us joy. Some of it, at least, can be
done for that purpose alone. The
reading that really becomes a part
of us is that which attracts .us
back time and again because of the
richness or perfection or depth of
the works. A suggestion for the
two-week vacation — read some-
thing, no matter how short, not for
information, nor for parallel or
a test, but simply for joy. That's
the beginning of a liberal educa-
tion.

“The most powerful poet who
has appeared in England or Ameri-
ca for some years,’? Robert
Lowell, won the Pulitzer Prize -in
1947 for-his second book> “Lord
Weary'’s Castle.”

Most of his works shows in one
form or another a conflict between
two opposite forces—“the conpla-
cent self... everything that is
closed, turned inward , . . that
blinds or binds .. . struggling with
this and falling to it like light is
everything that is free or open,
that grows or is willing to change.”’
The poetry is dramatic. Compres-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

WE ARE HYPOCRITES

Dear Editor:

Are you ever ashamed that you
go to Davidson? This question may
shock some students, but there are
times when I’m ashamed to be,
student at Davidson. At these
times, I should like nothing better
than to be a student at State. That’s
a horrible fate, but I would liked
to have been in Raleigh this morn-
ing during Chapel.

Davidson, supposedly a bulwark
of Christian education, is practicing
the cardinal sin of hpyocrisy when
a speaker cannot make a serious
speech on Christian work without
having half of her speech twisted
into channels of questionable and
susposedly humorous character.

This perverting of meaning illus-
trates that we are hpyocrites as
we call ourselves Christian students,
and yet seem to derive extreme
pleasure in mocking Christian
ideals.

Maybe I’m on the wrong track,
perhaps this element is not real-
ized by most students, perhaps it
isn’t a conscious element, but there
is one element in the shame of
Chapel of which cach student must
be aware,

This second element jis the rude-
ness of an entire student body to
visiting speakers, Davidson men are
known for being gentlemen outside
Chambers Auditorium. Why is it
that the institution of Chapel can
turn these gentlemen into a group
of ill behaved baboons for 25 min-
utes each day?

Personally, I should like to see
Chapel attendance made voluntary

paralleled in Davidson history.
al If, however, this cannot be ac-
complished, I propose that the Ex-

for it would be less embarrassing
to have three people in the audi-
ence, than to have the whole school
show collective rudeness  un-

ecutive Committee set up a Purple
Heart award for speakers who brave
the horrors of a Chapel speech.

One more point and I'll shut up.
I was dismayed to see the Fresh-
men following the example of the
“Upper Classes, (Ha).

The Upper Classes are leading
them astray. The salvation of Da-
vidson’s battered manners rest
squarely on their shoulders. If
they would but realize their re-
sponsibility to set a good example,
the rest of this year and the three
following years, we could re-
establish some element of basic
courtesy in Chapel.

How about it Freshmen? The up-
per classes are too far gone. “It’s
tradition with them.” Only you can
save the finest of Davidson insti-
tutions.

“DAMNATION

Dear Editor:

Abominable! Disgusting! Inde-
corus! Damnation, do we, a body
of supposedly “comparatively ma-
ture men, not know how to sit
quietly for a mere twenty-five min-
utes and listen to a man relate
soul-stirring experiences which he
has endured. Is it not possible to
at least give a decorous attention
to such a man as E. Stanton Tur-
ner even though there be a cer-

tain skeptical feeling as to the
veracity of his statements? (Be-
lieve me, we in the Davidson stu-
dent body know, we have had wide
and varied experiences—we know
the existing conditions everywhere.)

I experienced feelings of abhor-
rence and disgust at the reaction
to Mr, Turner’s address on Mon-
day when I observed about me the
supercilious smiles of certain of my
classmates, I could not help stlip-
ping as low as possible in my seat
with a very red face and a feeling
of ragé and chagrin at the in-
cessant buzz and hum of what, I
am sure, were very enlightening
conversations that acted as an un-
welcome accompaniment to the ad-
dress of one, whom I am convinced,
is as devoted and sincere a per-
sonage as ever spoke from a Da-
vidson rostrum.

There is no justification for the
conduct of our student body at its
chapel exercises. You can be sure
that the deplorable situation exists
in view of the fact that one sunk
as low as I in the senile lethargy
that prevails in the immediate en-
virons, should take it upon myself
to vent a bit of my spleen in writ-
ing to the “medium of communica-
tion” of which you are the editor.
Of course the several minutes em-
ployed in the construction of this
—you name it—were, to all prac-
tical purposes, wasted; but I think
it every Davidsonian’s duty to
write at least one missle within
his four years residence,

I hope that I’ve stepped on some
toes. 1’m not being presumptious,
and if I am, so what?

is in Charlotte. Charlotte, once
defined by one our faculty as
“Neither a village nor a city, hav-
ing all the disadvantages’ of both
and none of the advantages of
either,” has never had a really
good symphony orchestra. Many
godd intentions have been lavished
on the orchestra, but as often as
not only a musical hell has been
achieved down the road thus paved.
This year, however, Mr. Pfohl as-
sumed the conductorship of the
Charlotte Symphony, good inten-
tions have been replaced by good
musicianship, and for the first time
Charlotte has a symphony orches-
tra of which it can:justly be proud.

So when next you see Mr. Pfohl
in an official capacity, don’t think
of him as “the man who leads the
band,’’ but instead as a man whose
high qualities of musicianship and
character have enabled him to serve
not only our own college com-
munity, but also a great many
others, the list of whom now in-
cludes grateful Charlotteans who
give him thanks for their first com-
petent symphony orchestra.

We might well follow Charlotte's
example and give vocal expression
of our gratitude to Mr. Pfoh! him-
self.. He is not: hard to talk to and
will welcome critical comment as
well as lavish praise. This is so
because Mr. Pfohl, like any good
musician, is constantly striving to
improve the quality of any musical
undertaking in which he has a part.
