Ratchford laid down a perfect bunt |
on a squeeze play. In the sixth Poe |
idoubled to left and advanced to
third on Crawford’s sacrifice. Ratch-
ford again came across with a per-
fect bunt and Poe scored. The'
lucky seventh produced four tallies
for the Wildcats. Cassell, E., drew
a pass and stole second. Poe also
walked. At this juncture the two
[pulled a double steal. Crawford’s!
single scored Cassell and advanced
Poe to third. Ratchford struck out,
,but on another squeeze play begun
‘by Cassell, F., Poe scored and Craw-
| ford moved up to third, from where .
‘he scored on a passed ball. Cassell,
‘F,, stole second and third and also
