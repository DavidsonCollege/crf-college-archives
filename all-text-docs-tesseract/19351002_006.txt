This year’s Wildcat Handbook has
several additions and improvements to
the publications of former years. The
handbook has been enlarged, and a new
binding used. A fraternity date card and
a directory of class rooms and offices
have been added.

Paul Harlan is the editor of this year’s
edition, and Hoke Robinson is the busi-
ness manager. The handbook is dedicated
to Professor Ernest A. Beaty, of the
Latin and Italian departments. ©

The table of contents, as usual, in-
cludes the following chapters: general
information to freshmen, Y. M. C. A.
activities, student government, athletics,
fraternities, and songs and yells.

There are also messages to the stu-
dents from Albert McClure, “Y” Secre-
tary, President Lingle, Dr. Moffett, of
the Davidson College Presbyterian
Church, Professor Williams, dean of
freshmen, and Harvey Glass, president
of the Y. M. C, A.

Other helpful features are a who's
who at Davidson, a map..of the cam-
pus, and of fraternity court, a college
calendar, pictures of campus leaders and
personalities, a copy of the constitution
of the student body, and a class schedule.

The Wildcat Handbook is published
annually bythe Davidson Y. M. C. A.
This year’s publication is the twenty-
eighth. Anyone who has not yet pro-
cured his handbook may do so by calling

will carefully read this book, and keep
in mind the rules and
forth in it.

since the issue of the Journal, and that,
while no official check has been made,
indications are that the church and the
gymnasium lead in the voting to date.

The latest issue of the Alumni Jour-
nal, in addition to containing a detailed
account of that, mentioned above, also
includes a message from the president
of the Alumni Association, in which he
stresses the need for all alumni to sub-
scribe at once to the Journal, and other

important matters. There is an article
devoted to a disctission of the line-up
of the Davidson Wildcats for the new-
born season, with a schedule of games to
be played. Regular departments include
“With the Faculty,” “With the Alumni,”
and “Alumni in the News.”

On the front cover of this issue is
found a picture of Oak Row, .and on
the rear, one of the present Alumni
Gymnasium.
