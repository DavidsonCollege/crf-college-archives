THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 20, 1927

PLAYING THE GAME
With Withers

Win and Lose
Matmen Defeated
Spring Football

The Wildcat basketeers took on two op- |
ponents during the past week, losing a close |
decision to Salisbury “Y,” the conqueror of
Carolina, and winning from Union Theologi-
cal Seminary. The first of these games was
hard fought, while the
away.

second was a walk- |

Although the Salisbury “Y” affair was a

tough one to lose, consolation is to be had in |

the. fact that Anderson, of Davidson, tossed ;
what would have been the winning goal just |
after the final whistle was blown.

There was an clement of the unexpected |
in the defeat of the matimen at the hands of |
State College. Indications before the match
had pointed to a Davidson victory, as did
also the result of the first few matches, but
the State grapplers showed great improve-
ment in the heavier weights and deserved
their win.

The superb exhibition displayed by Captain

Frierson in the first match of the evening

brought to mind his record and that of Bill |

Cox, of last year’s mat team. Both of these

men went the season through without defeat
and were placed on several all-Southern
teams.

Coach Mattox led his first year yearling
quintet against Catawba College last Thurs-
day and came from the fray victorious by a
score of 23 to 15. Pritchett and Bz iker |
starred for the Wildkittens in this contest, |
the former registering 8 points to lead the |
field, while the latter guarded ly |
throughout. |

Coach Younger has announced that spring
football practice will commence’ about the |
first of February. “Tex” Tilson, after a
somewhat extended wedding trip, will return |
to the campus within the week and take |
charge of the squads. Spring training has
proven popular at Davidson and extremely
worthwhile. Last year, several new stars
were discovered during this regime and the
coaches are given an opportunity to see who's
who in the freshman class.

There is an increasing demand among. the
leading colleges of the South to organize
fencing teams. Some time ago a group of |
men on the campus proposed such a squad,
but since then we have heard nothing of the
subject. Have those interested become dis-
couraged? Don't let the interest drag!

making long trips, as in other branches of

Wildcat Quintet Plays
Two Games With Union
Seminary and and Salisbury

Drops Exciting Game to Salisbury

Smother Union Theologi-
cal Seminary Saturday

ON Fae

The Davidson Wildcats won their third
basketball contest of the season Saturday aft-
ernoon, from the Union Seminary team by
the overwhelming score of 42 to 16.

The game was slow and in some parts un-
interesting, due largely to looseness in pass-
ing of both teams. The Seminary showed
their lack of practice, missing many “snow- |
birds,” and making several wild passes.

For the Davidson team, McAuley, forward,
and Anderson, guard, were the features in
looping, McAuley being high-point man with
13 points, closely followed by Anderson with
12. Calhoun, center for the visitors, was the
outstanding player for the Ministers.

The line-up and summary follow:

Seminary (16) Position Davidson (42)
i Redhead (5) ~----- RBs cies Harrison (4)
| Bradley (2) ------ LF _--- McAuley (13)

Calhoun (4) ---- Center --.-- Wilson (2)

Substitutions — Seminary: Lynn (4), Og-
den. Davidson: Crawford, Calhoun (1),

Referee: Mattox (Washington and Lee).

Myers’ field goal that swished through the
nets from a difficult angle in the last few
seconds of play gave the Salisbury “Y” a
34-33 victory over, the Davidson College
cagers last Thursday night in Salisbury.

The game was a thriller from beginning
to end, and neither team accumulated a de-

last Saturday night by the close score of 15
to 11. Davidson started out in fine style,
| winning three out of four of the first
| matches, the other being a draw in the 128-
| pound class, but met disaster in the latter
| bouts when three straight falls were regis-
tered by State. Superior weight and ex-
perience were the telling factors in these
last tussles. ;

The matches were hard-fought throughout,
with the result of the meet in doubt until the
last fall. Results were as follows:

118 pound class—Smith, State, lost to Cap-
tain Frierson, Davidson, by fall in one min-
ute, eight seconds.

128 pound class—Ginn, State, and Flythe,
Davidson, draw, in two extra periods.

138 pound class—Leary, State, lost to
Davis, Davidson, by four minutes, 52 seconds

ciding lead at any time: The half ended
19-1 dado of Salisbury, but Davidson
came back with renewed strength in the sec-
ond period and quickly swung into a 22-20
lead.

The Salisburians tied the count, took the
lead, and the advantage alternated throughout
the rest of the game. ,

McAuley was the high-point scorer of the
game with 12 points, while Myers and Dun-
ham were high scorers for the, “Y’”. Close
guarding was a feature of the tilt, with
many exceptionally good shots adding to the
interest of the contest.

“Thy sins be forgiven thee,” is ready to for-
