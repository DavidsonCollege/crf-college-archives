nomenon further, our visitor turns
the corner and comes face to face
with none other than: Bugs Bunny,
or a reasonable facsimile thereof,
pointing to a tree on which is
tacked a newspaper bearing the
headlines: “Davidson hit by ATOm
bomb!" Judging by the prominent
first three letters of the word
“ATOm” that this is the newly
organized ATO club, he glances
further to see a miniature football
field underneath the tree, and,
glancing up, spies a Wildcat,
ATOm bomb in paw, ready to drop
the dreadful weapon upon the field.
Recovering from this terrible fright,

Any visitor to this campus
toward the last of the week
would doubtless have wondered
about the mentality of the Da-
vidson student, if he were to
have passed through fraternity
court and watched the loyal
brothers hustling about with a ham-
mer in one hand, some crayons in the
other, and a large caricature bal.
anced precariously on the head. He
would no doubt have looked twice,
scratched his head in amazement,
and tried to decide just what phe-
nomena was present to cause such
a scene. Next he might conclude,
from the array of wild animals, that
Davidson college had been convert-
ed into a zoo (with professors
serving different purposes than
those they now have), or that a
movie company was “on location”
for the newest Tarzan picture.
Wiping these thoughts from his
mind as a bit unreasonable, how-
ever, he might then just accidentally
have remembered that this is
Homecoming weekend and that all
the Greeks are going whole-hog
over this idea of winning the prize
for the cleverest House decorations.

Deciding to investigate this phe-

Bands Share In
Gridiron Glory

It may be Charlie Spivak and
company on the dance floor this
weekend, but it will be the David-
son and Lenior football bands on
the gridiron.

Davidson's football band will
make its third appearance of :

he sees a W & L General teaning
over with hands on ears, waiting
for the explosion. Which all adds
up to the fact that the W & IL.
generals will inevitably be blasted,
now that the ATOm bomb has ar-
rived on the campus.

Marvelling over the apparent sign
of genius among the Davidson
ATO's, our friend slowly winds his
way next door, when what to his
wondering eyes should appear but
two W & L Generals— one of them
none other than General Robert E.
Lee, (who appears on this program
by special arrangement with U. S.
Grant); fast ascending a tree, with
added ventilation entering through
a large jagged hole in the seat of
his pants and with the culprit, a
Wildcat, clutching said seat between
his teeth. The other general (who
else but George Washington, com.
plete with hatchet in hand) is head-
ing for the bushes to escape the
wrath of the Mighty Wildcats.

Leaving the scene of these esca-
pades, the Beta house no Jess, our
visitor proceeds to.the Fiji house
where the White Star shines down
upon a large boiling caldron, lo.
cated conveniently in the front
yard. A large Wildcat sits by this
caldron, holding in his mouth the
dangling figufe of a not-long-for-
this-world W & L General.

Moore, who plans and directs the
colorful half-time maneuvers.

Led by Capt. James C. Harper,
the Lenior high school band, rep-
resenting the visitors from Wash-
ington and Lee University, will also
perform at Saturday's game with
Davidson's band. This is a nation-
ally famous high school band with
approximately 60 pieces.

Pre-game band maneuvers wilt |
be led off by Davidson with a
short greeting for the visitors and
alumni. After this the two bands
will join together for the Star-
Spangled Banner.

Lenoir will perform first during |

the half-time intermission with ring |
cision drill formations. The half
will be concluded by Davidson's
giving a salute to Washington and
Lee—playing the Washington and
Lee Swing and forming the letters
WL. The last half-time maneuver
will be a special homecoming salute
with the band spelling out David-
son, one letter at a time, while
playing “Oh Davidson.”
’ The Davidson band will also fur-
nish music Saturday morning at
the pep rally scheduled for 11:00
in front of Chambers Building.

vious appearances this year it has
done well, indicating the high cali-

Spaniards Convene
To Discuss Policy

Discussion of plans and policies
for the coming year occupied the
attention of the smail number of
members present for the first meet-
ing of Sigma Delta Pi and the Span-
ish club. At this meeting, held on
October 4, a project for policy was
presented by the President, Mr. C.
S. Lewis: the various points in the
paper arroused quite a bit of com.
ment. Because of the differing view-
points of those present, it was de-
cided that Sigma Delta Pi should
hold a business meeting after fur-
ther consideration and come to a de-
cision. The meeting was held at the
home of Dr. A. V. Goldiere. This
year’s policy concerning meetings,
membership, programmes, etc., is to
be announced at the next meeting.

The recurrence of gorgeous October days has come to spell
Homecoming at Davidson. It is my satisfying delight to extend
the heartiest welcome to you—one and all—for this happy occa-
sion. This greeting is extended on behalf of the entire Davidson
family, resident here and working in and for the College. We are
exhilirated by the coming of our friends and guests and stand
ready to do all within our power to make your visit pleasant and

rewarding.

To the ALUMNI, we say “Welcome Home.” It is our desire
thae every former student should continue to feel a sense of at-
home-ness here. The victorious conclusion of our Development
Program which has claimed our attention at the last two Home-
comings adds to the joy we feel in your presence today. May the
renewing of the ties of friendship and the inbreathing of the
spirit of this beautiful old campus prove a balm to your spirits.

And to our Visitors, we are glad you have come. To Welcome
you is a pleasure. We shall be happier in our own Homecoming
because of your presence with us. Especially, to “the bevy of
fair women, richly gay” would the Faculty and Student Body
say “thrice welcome” as you join us in our festive season. May
it prove a rare, happy time for us all.

Cripple Creek Boys
Descend On Chapel;
Classic Music Bows

All apprehensions regarding Fri-
day the 13th were lifted last week
when on that day the comparative
ly serene atmosphere of Chapel was

shattered with the season’s first:

public appearance of the “Cripple
Creek Boys,” one of the more
Spirited musical organizations on the
campus. Sporting the latest in mu-
sical entertainment, the boys were
received with wild enthusiasm by
the student body.

According to self-acclaim, the
ringleader of the outfit is Ansel
Moses; bat quite naturally the rest
of the boys disagree violently. Ansel
hails from the capital of Tenness-
see, Lookout Mountain, and special-
izes on the banjo. Another boy
from Lookout Mountain is Fletcher
“Fidlin’ Flutch” Bright, who tears

ments. Next in line is the crooner
of the bunch, Louie “Pretty Boy”
Runge from Greenville, S. C., where
he has a band of his own, “The
Rungleers.” Aside from his singing,
Louie does a little guitar playing,
too. A second guitar specialist is
the composer of the “Hogan Rag”,
“Tiny Jim” Hogan from Lenoir,
N. C. The fellow with the mean
but mellow mandolin is Milton
Craig, a stringbean from Mt. Holly.
A man with considerable variety ia
Kennett “Uglier-tnan-I-am” Smith
who picks the banjo, plays the har.
monica, and tapdances (not all at
ope time). The last (but not the
least important) is Bob “Kat’’? Mc-
Pheeters who claims Greensboro
as home. A moosic lover of the
first water, “Kat” not only is an
ardent Dixieland fan, but is a clas.
sical addict of Prof. Pfohl’s. How-
ever, he reaches his highest point

educated).

literary-minded young thing
in *Rumele was taking notes for a
forthcoming novel. She claims it
will make “Thirty Days in a Nazi
Death Camp” seem like a children’s
tale. This same girl awoke Satur-
iday morning with a terrible cramp
in her spine. Complaining to her
date later, she was told she must
have forgotten to put a brick under
the short bed leg.

The young ladies have indeed

she didn’t sleep.

A sharp, piercing scream rang
out, and the girl dashed out of
Rumple. Sobbing, she told her be-

et flashlights, they managed to find
their way back to the outside world.
They forgot to tell one girl about
that tricky third step, but it’s not
everyone who can go to a dance on
crutches. Another date couldn't
imagine why there were so many
little nicks in her floor. It turned
out they were where boys throw-
ing knives at rats had missed,

As a special favor to the girls
Mrs. Little insisted that the col-
lege install hot water taps. The
hot water itself is expected next
year.

In Duke all the girls were afraid
to leave their rooms for fear of
never getting back in the right
section. It seems the architect
wanted to prove to his firm he
could design a building with his
eyes clused. As a matter of fact,
that’s about the best way to get
where you're going in the place.
One ingenious lass unravelled a
ball of string from her room to be
sure and find it after the dance.
When she returned there were forty
balls of string on the stair.

PHOTOGRAPHERS MEET

The Photo Club met last Tues-

theme, FUNDAMENTALS IN

Under the direction of Dave
Mathewes, the Club’s president, Al-

of developing a film. Those who
were new in the Club and young
in the knowledge of photography
peered through the darkness with
interest as Allen worked the film
wp and down in the ‘simple tray

The Student Body is again
reminded of the American Red
Cross Blood Drive to be con-
ducted in the basement of the
College Infirmary between the
hours of 11 a. m. and 5 p. m.
On Thursday, the 26th. Colonel
Ballard, who is chairman of the
drive for the College and the
community, states that plans
are moving along well. More
student response is needed,
however, and it is hoped that
many more appointment per-
dods can be filled before the ar-
rival of the Red Cross Person-

It is emphasized again that
blood saves lives, and that a
great deal of blood is needed
in Korea for the fighting forces,
and even, to a lesser degree, in
the community around us:

Film Society Makes
Plans for Expansion

Since the celebrated birth. of the
United Literary Society recently,
the society, founded by Eu and
hi to bring classical films to the
campus, has grown by leaps and

Pbounds; but it has experienced a

few growing pains in the process.

Irving Stubbs explained that the
dea was conceived last spring
while the two literary societies were
searching for a worthy joint proj.
ect. A committee consisting of Ken
Gooupasture, Irving Stubbs, Watt
Jeffries, and Jim Campbell, with
Professors Roberts and Cummings,
explored the possibilities of such
a project, and their favorable re-
port- was accepted by both socixties
early in the fall. This committee
worked long and hard to secure de-
sirable films and select a time and
place to show them. Their decision
was to show five movies this semes-
ter on Friday nights in Shearer
Hall. To avoid Federal tax, a sort
of Film Soceity was set up, with
$1.00 membership cards admitting
students to all five films.

The plan evoked enthusiastic
support from the student body, and
all tickets were sold within 15 min-
utes. This inspired the committee
to find a larger theater than Shearer
Hail (seating capacity: 250), and
efforts are now beirig made to
secure Chambers Auditorium. If
these efforts are successful, tickets
for the entire student body and
faculty will be available; if not, the
society will try to arrange for two
showings of the film in Shearer
Hall. The committee is still in the
process of securing pictures and a
