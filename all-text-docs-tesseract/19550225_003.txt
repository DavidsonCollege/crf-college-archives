Precise Center of
Universe Discovered

Columbus, Ohio-—(ACP)—A pre-
cise position for the center of our
island universe or Milky Way sys-
tem has been announced by radio
astronomers at Ohio State Univer-
sity here.

“Position of the nucleus has
long been sought by optical as-
tronomers,” the Daily Lanter re-
ports, but it is hidden from view
by vast clouds of interstellar dust.
However, the nucleus is a potent
transmitter of radio waves, which
are unhindered by the dust clouds
and ore readily received by radio
telescopes.

“Our own sun and billions of
other stars revolve at great dis-
tances around this hub, forming
a gigantic wheel turning slowly in
space.”

“In a new report entitled ‘The
Radio Position of the Galactic
Nucleus,’ Dr. John D. Kraus and
Research Assistant H. C. Ko, of
the electrical engineering staff,
pinpoint the position of the hub

to a hundredth of a degree. Here-}

tofore it has been estimated not
much closer than the nearest de-
gree.”

DONALO PLOTT

Prof. Plott Chosen as
Guest Conductor for
Toledo Music Festival

Prof. Donald Plott, Director of
Music at Davidson, left Wednesday
for Toledo, Ohio, where he will be
the guest conductor of the Toledo
All-City High School Choral Fes-
tival.

The Festival will be held Sunday,
Feb. 27, in Toledo Museum of Arts.

Each of the seven Toledo high
schools, with their directors, will
perform separately on the pro-
gram, after which the massed
choir of 300 students, directed by
Prof. Plott and with orchestral ac-
companiment, will present the
three closing selections.

The Davidson College Male
Chorus sang in the De Vilbiss High
School in Toledo while on a recent
tour.

Mr. Plott, a native of Winston-
Salem, was graduated from the
University of Michigan in 1948
with a Bachelor of Music degree,
and in 1949 with a Master of Music
degree. In addition to college choir
directing and teaching posts, he
has had experience as church
choir director, soloist, and in radio
work. He has appeared in six
operas, in three of which he had
the title role. He has been a fre-
quent guest conductor for choirs
and choruses in this area. He is

28 per cent answer the split will
make no difference, and 3 per
cent held no opinion.

There are no appreciable sex
differences on this question, but
some answers show a distinct party
loyalty, such as the freshman coed
from New York University who
answers that “Southern Demo-
crats wilt not help the situation.”
Other students feel that Ike has
received more help from the Dem-
ocratic party than from his own.

“Ike has Democratic leanings, so
the split will not make much dif-
ference,” answers a senior coed
from St. Catherine’s college in
Minneapolis.

A pessimistic junior from Colo-
rado A.&M. says he believes “No
matter how hard they may try, the
harmony needed will never be
reached.” A number of students
qualify their answers by stating
that the split will help foreign
policy but will hinder domestic
policy.

Some students indicate a very
deep grasp of political intricacies,
as is indicated by the sophomore
from El Camino College in Call-
fornia when he answers, “I believe
that the two parties actually differ
very little in their platforms and
basic programs, therefore, the split
should make little difference.”

A male sophomore attending the
Richmond Professional Institute in
Virginia considers the problem
from a stightly different angle
when he states “No matter which
party is in power, ‘bloc’ votes can
help or hinder any legislation.”

Student Group Urges

End to Hydrogen Tests

New York—(ACP)—A “Students
to Stop the Bomb” movement has
been formed by eight. students at
Columbia University, the Barnard
Bulletin reports,

The purpose of this group,
recognized by the University Com-
mittee on Student Organizations,
is to urge the cessation of atomic
and hydrogen bomb tests by the
United States. A spokesman of the
student group said that similar
groups are being formed at City
College and New York University.

By Functionalism

Urbana, 11.—(LP.)—At the col-

demands in history teaching have
been the various “new ap-
proaches,” according to Professor
Raymond P. Stearns of the Uni-
versity of Illinois. “These include
a variety of names: ‘integrated
courses,’ ‘fusion courses,’ ‘prob-
lems courses,’ ‘laboratory courses,’
‘core curricula,’ ‘world history,’
and ‘general education,’ at least
as general education is often in-
terpreted outside the Ivy League.”

Professor Stearns points out
that in the eyes of the functional-
ists in education, these “new ap-
proaches” are generally ineffective
as instruments for education in
democratic citizenship . . . “Those
members of the historical profes-
sion who believe that the nub of
the controversy between historians
and educationalists is a question
merely of ‘methods’ in the class-
room would be well-advised to take
another—and a closer—look. More-
over, in spite of ‘new approaches,’
history is found wanting by those
very functionalists who have been
so instrumental in bringing about
these novelties.

“And history has been affected
by the functionalists’ demands,
fortified, as the latter have been,
by the crises of the past half cen-
tury. Broader treatment of human
affairs, especially horizontally may
be accounted an improvement both
in teaching and research; but the
widespread ‘present - mindedness’
of historians, as exhibited by their
increasing preoccupation with cur-
rent affairs, destroys perspective,
belies historical-mindedness, and
tears to bits the seamless garment
of Cito.

“Aas the functionalists seem dis-
posed to consign history to ob-
livion anyway, perhaps those his-
torians who have striven so man-
fully to meet the functionalists’

back to teaching history for his-
tory’s sake.”

Pittsburgh, Pa. (1.P.)—Pennsy}-
vania College for Women has a
challenging opportunity to be “the
finest liberal orts college in the
land.” This is the conclusion of
an evaluation team that has been
making “A Survey of General Col-
lege Policy and Curriculum” here.

The committee, in their inten-
slve study of the entire college,
pays high tribute to the PCW cur-
riculum, student body, and faculty.
In particular, the basic curriculum
courses come in for special praise.
“The basic program opens the door
for all students to obtain a general
understanding of important areas
of knowledge, and prevents their
taking hodge-podge and _ iil-bal-
anced programs so characteristic
of the old optional systems.”

The tutorial program in which
each student does a special re-
search problem in her senior year
is rated as one of the strong fea-
tures of the curriculum. It is
further suggested by the commit-
tee that the already excellent stu-
dent-faculty ratio of one faculty
member to every ten students be
augmented by an increase of eight
new faculty members, who would,
in addition to teaching responsi-
bilities, lighten the tutorial and
counselling loads of the present
staff.

The contribution of the college
to the Pittsburgh community is
also examined... The committee
recommends that PCW should re-
main a center for citizenship and
leadership training, and that the
college should continue to bring
outstanding lecturers and artists to
the campus who may be appre-
ciated by the entire community.

The PCW Opera Workshop,
Lyric Theater, and the Laboratory
School of Music are endorsed as
major contributions to the cul-
tural life of Pittsburgh. At the
same time, however, that the col-
lege is strengthening its role in
Pittsburgh, the commtitee feels it
should also strive to become more
national in scope.

The evaluation committee is
comprised of Dean Emeritus Harry
Carman of Columbia University as
chairman, Dr. A. J. Brumbaugh,
former vice president of the
American Council on Education,
and Dean Stanton Crawford of the
College of Arts and Science at the
University of Pittsburgh.

The committee is one of several
that has been appraising the col-
lege. In addition, survey teams
are examining the college’s admin-
istrative management procedures
and its overall public relations.
These committees are all making
confidential reports to the Board
of Trustees of the College.

Marriage Seminar

Under Restrictions

Storrs, Conn.—(I.P.)}—The Uni-
versity of Connecticut is extending
an invitation to national fraterni-
ties to affiliate with the locals
now on campus, according to 3
recent issue of the Interfraternity
Research and Advisory Council
publication. Mr. Reuben B. John-
son, assistant director of student
personnel, stated the prerequisites
for establishing a chapter. These
include:

1. The Constitution and By-
laws of the national] must not con-
tain clauses which restrict mem-
bership because of race, religion,
or national origin.

2. The national organizations
should have chapters located on
campuses in New England and
the mid-Atlantic states, preferra-
bly at institutions with which this
University has intercollegiate com-
petition and other inter-change of

activities.

Down With Darwin:

Colorado State Legislature to Vote on
Ban in Teaching Evolution in State Schools

Boulder, Colo — (ACP) — The
question of the teaching of- evolu-
tion is headed for the state legis-
lature, the Colorado Daily reports.

Rev. Gladden William James,
head of the Foundation for the
authenticity of the Bible and for
Religious Liberty, has presented
to a state representative a resolu.
tion seeking to ban the, teaching
of evolution in state-supporte
schools.

The basis of the James resolu:
tion comes from the First Amend-

stitution banning the teaching of
evolution.

“However,” he concluded, “we
don’t mind having books by Dar-
win and the other evolutionists in
the library, because that is follow.
ing the idea of freedom of speech
and the press. Our complaint is
lodged against actually teaching it
in the classrooms, or using those
books as textbooks.”

J. G. Mackie, a state legislator
from Boulder, took the opposite

ment of the U. S. Constitution,| view of the issue, according to

dealing with separation of church
and state powers.

When asked whether he co
sidered the teaching of evolution
@ subject of religious nature, Rev.
James said, “I! certainly do. The
teaching of evolution is a ques-
tion of religion; it is not one of
science.

“If we don't get legislative sup-
port,” Rev. James added, “we will
submit an initiative to the people
of the state, and try to push across
an amendment to the Colorado con-

Jenk Jones, Colorado Daily re-
porter. Mackie stated, “I for one

n.| Will, fight the James resolution.

We would not even consider such
a resolution in the House; in fact,
it would probably be buried in
committee.”

Mackie added, “This is not some-
thing for the legislature to de-
cide. The University should have
its choice of what subjects it
wishes to teach.”

New Study Groups

UNC Making Progress! Organized by YMCA

In Achieving Goals

Chapel Hill, N.C.—(LP.)—The
University of North Carolina is
making substantial progress in
most phases of its program and is
gradually achieving many of the
goals set by the two State of the
University Conferences, Chancellor
Robert H. House reported .here re-
cently.

Among other things, he pointed
out, greater efficiency and clear-
ance has been achieved as a result
of reorganization of the Univer-
sity’s administrative set-up: that
closer personal relations are being
established between faculty mem.
bers and students; that Saturday
classes apparently are an achieved
fact, and that more full-time pro-
fessors are being placed in charge
of undergraduate instruction.

Although enrollment has in-
creased, classroom loads have been
reduced, and steps are being taken
to bring the University into closer
touch with the public schools, the
Chancellor added.

The admission of Negro students
to the professional schools has not
produced any friction so far, and
none is anticipated, he said.

Mr. Sam Magill has announced
the formation of two new study
groups to be sponsored by the
YMCA. The subject of the first
group will be “Contemporary
Theology.” and will use as a source
hook What Present-Day Theolo
gians Are Thinking by Daniel Day
Williams. This group will meet
once every two weeks on Sunday
afternoon in the faculty lounge
ofthe College Union.

The second group will study
“Christianity and Contemporary
Social Problems,” using Christian
Ethics end Sociel Problems by
John S. Bennett. This group will
meet on the second and fourth
Tuesdays of the month. Both
groups will have a qualified faculty
member as a leader. All students
interested in these groups are
urged to come by the YMCA of.
fice and sign up.

Mr. Magill also announced the
beginning of a new course of study
by the Freshman’ Fellowship
Group, which has been in existence
since November. The group meets
the first and third Thursdays of
each month at 8:30 under the

leadership of John Fenton.

The Converse College chorus from Spartanburg, S. C., will present the chapel program at David..
son next Thursday. The 60-voice ensemble under the direction of Mrs. Alia Ross Lawson of Con-
verse’s School of Music faculty, will feature sacred and secular selections as well as American

folk tunes.

Work Toward Quick [Proposal Announced

End of Discrimination|4! ¥. C- State Coleg

Boulder, Colo. — (1.P.)—The
Faculty Senate of the University
of Colorado recently recommended
to the Bourd of Regents that it
adopt the SOSL (student organiza-
tions and social life) policy on dis-
crimination in fraternal organiza-
tions instead of the controversial
Austin (Regent H. Vance Austin)
anti-discrimination bill.

The SOSL recommendations are
also designed to end discrimina-
tions in fraternal organizations on
this campus, but they differ from
the Austin motions in these re-
spects: in the SOSL policy there
is no deadline for ending dis-
crimination, nor is there a pro-
vision for notifying potential
pledges about the discrimination
policies, if any, of their prospective
fraternal organizationg. It does,
however, include a clause exempt-
ing religious groups. which is not
part of the Austin motion.

President Ward Darley, stressing
the fact that there was no debate
on whether or not discrimination
should be permitted to exist but
on the means toward ending it,
said, “Our objective is to eliminate
discrimination in the University
community. The
question we have here is whether
a terminal date will help or hinder
in reaching a true solution to this
problem.”

At the faculty senate mecting
proponents of the terminal date
said that it was necessary so that
the so-called educational process
would not drag on endlessly. Oppo-
nents of the terminal date said
that the fraternities still having
discriminatory clauses would not
cooperate if a deadline, such as
the 1960 himit set by Austin, were
imposed upon them. In that case,
the opponents argued. the anti-
discrimination bill would have. ad-
verse effects.

At the meeting President Darley
said that he personally would meet
with the presidents of all nine
fraternities that still have dis-
criminatory clauses and urge them
to do everything possible to get
rid of these clauses.

We Got Troubles?

Michigan Chapels Make Us Liberal

Alma, Mich.—(1.P.)—A report on
the first student counci) workshop
of church-related colleges of
Michigan, held on the Alma Col-
lege campus, disclosed that
chapel programs at the various
schools ranged from one to five
a week, and the number of cuts
from two a month at Alma to
three a semester at Kalamazoo.

At Adrian College, one-hour
chapel programs are held three
times ao week, and students are
allowed three cuts per semester.
Students must attend chapel for
two years of the four or read
twenty selected books. Five honor
points per semester, making a total
of twenty for four years, are given
for chapel attendance.

Albion’s chapel meets two times
a week and three cuts per semes-
ter during the four years are al-
lowed. For each overcut, one-half
hour is added to the graduation
requirement. One of the two
chapels at Albion each week is

religious in nature. The chapel
committee is composed of student
members. .

Calvin College presents three
chapels per week and allows three
cuts per semester.

Each faculty member must speak
in chapel at least once. Chapel
programs, which ore broadcasted,
last about fifteen minutes.

Hillsdale College holds one
chapel a week, with three culs
per semester. The vice-president
of the college is chairman of the
college chapel committee, which
selects the chapel speakers. Stu-
dents are responsible for the wor-
ship services. Programs vary in
content and usually last about
forty-five minutes.

Chapel is held five days a week
at Hope College, and the services
last about twenty minutes. Five
cuts per semester are allowed;
alter ten cuts the student is called
Before the dean and may be sus.

pended.

Kalamazoo’s chapel is held twice
a week, and three cuts per semes-
ter are allowed. The programs
usualy last about half hotfr.

OISCIPLINE

The report also disclosed how
each of the church-related schools
handles discipline. At Adrian,
each student must sign a morals
card before gaining admittance to
the college. This card is a promise
that he will not smoke or drink
while attending college. Smoking
is limited to the fraternity houses.
Students may be suspended for a
semester or expelled, or put on
social probation, for drinking.

At Albion, the student council
has no power in student discipline,
and smoking is allowed only in
specified areas of the campus. At
Calvin, student discipline resides
in a faculty board. Minor prob-
lems go to this board, and serious
problems are taken wp by the

faculty board.

At Hillsdale, there is a dual
probation system whereby a stu-
dent on social probation is pro-
hibited from attending social func-
tions, and certain conduct will al-
low the student to attend two
dances of his choice.

Discipline at Hope resides in a
committee consisting of the col-
lege president, two deans, and
president, vice-president, secretary
and treasurer of the student coun-
cil. This committee has the power
of suspension or expulsion. On
his first offense, a student goes to
the president and deans; for the
second, he is called before the
student committee.

Kalamazoo has a judicial council
made up of four students and
faculty advisers, who decide on dis-
cipline problems, including drink-
ing, and have the power to put a
student on social probation for the
first offense, and to expel for the
second offense.

Raleigh—(LP.)\—A modern new
fraternity housing center — de-
signed for group living and
equipped with a wide range of
social functions—has been pro-
posed at North Carolina State Col-
lege. The proposal, college authori-
ties disclosed here recently, has
received the endorsement of the
institution's Development Council.

Moving toward the establish-
ment of the center, the council
has authorized the appointment
of a committee to obtain the serv-
ices of an advisory group to aid
the college administration and fra-
ternities in implementing the plan
and in arranging the necessary fi-
nancing for the houses. The pro-
posed center was advocated by the
Development Council’s Plans and
Projects Committee.

Under the terms of the tentative
proposal, the fraternity center
would include buildings planned
especially for group living with
approval of the individual chap-
térs, college authorities, and the
Interfraternity Council.

The college's 17 social fraterni-
ties are now located in Raleigh’s
residential areas and occupied
buildings originally designed as
family living units. A new zoning
ordnance limits the fraternites to
the downtown business district or
to less desirable residential areas.

Senior Placement

Seniors are reminded to keep in
contact with the schedule of place-
ment conferences so that they may
take full advantage of opportunities
for jobs after graduation.
