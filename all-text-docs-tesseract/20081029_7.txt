Dow Jones Party C Causes Court-wide Panic:
“Get up, get up, and get down” theme deemed worst since Depression

There was mass confusion on
the floor. Papers, frantic shout-
ing, strange hand signals. What
had started four hours earlier with
hushed tones and vague specula-
tion had turned into the blackest

- hight in Patterson Court history.

By the time the lights came on
32 cases of beer and countless good
memories had vanished from the
Sigma Nu fraternity. For the last 45
minutes the music was extremely
sporadic, as students swayed their
bodies awkwardly, unsure of what
would come next.

“I was just getting into M.I.A.’s
‘Paper Planes’ when a Creed/Nick-
elback remix came on.” comment-
ed Jody Kellogg 709. “Good God.
What can you do?”

At 12:30 a.m. fraternity bar-
tenders Steve Hoogland and Owen
Zinaman began to vote on a $70
beer-bailout. The plan was passed
at 12:31 a.m. but was then vetoed

by risk manager Leroy Stevens at
12:33 a.m. when it became appar-
ent that neither party was sober
enough to drive the quarter-mile to
the local Exxon station.
Frustration, then panic coursed

Party Level

“Will we have to drink punch?
Will the Outpost raise quesadilla
prices again? Will my father finally
love me?” questioned dazed sopho-
more Tyler Kaplan.

A graph of party energy level versus time. As beer ran out and music
became more erratic, partiers panicked. Within hours, parties around

the world were in a frenzy.

through the dance floor. Partiers
feared the decision would imperil
the party as well as the broader Da-
vidson social scene.

Phi and other fraternities, as treasur-
ers began discussions about how to
avoid a similar fate, nervous guests
poured out from every possible

exit. At Appalachian State parties
sank in size by an average of 15%.
In Tibet, where they do not even
have fraternities, even more young
men turned to monastic life.

Although the crash has affected
parties at univerities and colleges
across the nation, some analysts are
saying this is in fact the best time
to party.

According to NPR fratologist
Robert Gillespie, “With nobody on
the dance floor or at the bar, cheap
beer and hot girls should be easy to
come by. That sure beats hot beer
and cheap girls. In times like these:
party low, study high.”

How to Talk About Your Unique
Semester in [insert country here]

I spent last semester in [insert
country—if your listener is well
traveled, name a place like Dji-
bouti, where the Capital is also Dji-
bouti].

I chose a [insert unselective
Midwestern university] program
because I wanted a [unique, alter-
native, unchallenging] adventure.
Plus, when’s the next time I'll be
able to goof around in [Rio, Flor-
ence, Darfur]?

While you were losing sleep
over Davidson classes, I was losing
my [summer savings, mind, reli-
gion] at really cool [discotheques,
rave parties, soirees, tribal sacrific-
es]. The relaxed schedule gave me
plenty of time to explore the local
{culture, women, hashish]—if you
know what I mean. [Insert provoca-
tive gesture].

One night we went [clubbing,
slumming, samba-dancing, yo-
deling] in the center of the city.
Those [French, Swiss, Swahili]
go out much later than Americans.
Even though I remember the [club,
beach, ghetto, mountain-top] be-
ing only a short [metro, taxi, tram,
rickshaw] ride away, after fourteen
shots of [limoncello, sambuca, fire-
water], I had no idea how to get to
my [apartment, hostel, adobe hut,
mistress’s penthouse].

The only [French, Portuguese,
Sanskrit], phrase I knew was

[“Don’t shoot,” “Three beers,” “Do
you have herpes?”), so instead of
asking for directions I walked un-
til I saw the [embassy, obelisk, arc,
prostitute].

Clockwise from top left: the soccer
match/riot/execution; local; some-
thing cultural; pretty girl.

Don’t be fooled, I did some
cultural stuff as well. I went to the
{parliament, national gallery, fish
market] and the birthplace of [Mo-
zart, Cezanne, Tintin].

[If your audience challenges
you, remind your listener that he or
she, in fact, did not go abroad.] I
also went to a [soccer match, riot,
ritualistic sacrifice]. Now that was
an experience! Abroad was a blast.
I learned a little, and had a lot of
fun. Coming home, I felt not only
privileged, but unique.

Baseball. Our national pastime,
one that promotes tobacco, pin-
stripes but most of all, utter failure.
Why do we continue to create role
models who have the success rate
of the No Child Left Behind Act?

If you ask me, it’s bad for our
children. My kid came home with
a 45% on his addition quiz last
week and couldn’t stop smiling.

“That’s better than even Manny

+ would’ve done on that test, Daddy,”

he said.

Does that send the right mes-
sage to our youth? Is it okay that
Jeter Jr. is batting .350 in Pre-Calc
and still thinks he’s going to make
the honor roll?

Furthermore, in what other
facet of life are you presented with
three clear chances to not screw
up? “Oh, no honey, I don’t mind
that you slept with her. Just don’t
do it two more times.”

So in regard to my relationship
with a sport that rewards one’s abil-
ity to observe someone else screw-
ing up four times, thank you, but
Pll find a different way to pass my
time.
