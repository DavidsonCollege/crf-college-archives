Davidson Boys Don’t Want Compulsory —
Physical Drill Questionnaire Reveals

“We Don’t Want to Exercise,” Stu-
dents Declare—“Just Leave Us
Alone!”

of Interest

questionnaire reveals further.

These and other interesting facts were re

vealed by answers to a questionnaire, recently
distributed among the Davidson students by
a sub-committee of the general fact-finding
committee of students and faculty members
appointed by the president of the college last
fall to investigate social conditions on. the
local campus. Only 331 students responded
to the inquiries contained in the question

In answer to the equestion, “How much
money--aside from blanket fee—do vor
spend attending athletic contests?” the stu

dents gave various estimates. Members «

the Freshman class are the most thrifty in

th’s-respeet, the average expenditure for the |

first-year men aggregating only $8.58. The
Juniors proved the most extravagant, with an
average expenditure per student of $14.70

per vear for athletic contests. The average

expenditure for the entire student body was
only $11.84.
