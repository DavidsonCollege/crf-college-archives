THE DAVIDSONIAN

Bluebird houses,

tropical forests
& the EAC

By Court McBryde

Tropical deforestation, the
plight of African honeybees, and
the condition of raptors are issues
which will be addressed by
Davidson’s Environmental Action
Committee this semester. The
committee is composed of students
who wish to make a difference in
today's global environment.

Last semester, the EAC com-
pleted a variety of projects includ-
ing an insulated mug sale intended
to promote recycling and reduce
styrofoam use on campus.

Bluebird houses, built by
members of the committee, are in
the process of being installed in
woody areas around the campus.
The committee hopes to encour-
age the nesting of bluebirds on
campus and to further the bird
population in the Davidson Col-
lege area.

One of the most successful
EAC projects was a letter-writing
campaign in protest of the statute
which allows road building through
National Parks and other protected
lands. Catherine Rideout, presi-
dent of the EAC, said that it was
“exciting to see people taking the
time to get involved. There were
certain people I was surprised to
see stop and ask questions and
write letters.”

Rideout emphasizes that “itis
important for people to realize that
participation is essential in terms
of the environmental movement
succeeding.”

A letter-writing campaign
scheduled for this semester will
address tropical deforestation.

Marrow donors
dine together

By Julie Ferguson

On Tuesday, February 15,
Davidson hosted the fourth annual
Marrow Donor Celebration, which
was sponsored by the Red Cross.
Over 24 marrow donors and re-
cipients from around the Carolinas
gathered at this dinner to celebrate
life together. :

Davidson was chosen as the
site of this gathering because of the
success of its own marrow drives.
Davidson has added over 1500
people to the National Registry
over the last three years, three of
whom have become actual donors.

Also in attendance at the din-
ner were Dr. Craig Howe, Chief
Executive Officer of the National
Marrow Donor Program; Dr. N.

Rebecca Haley, Chief Medical -

Officer of the Red Cross Blood
Services Carolinas Region; and Dr.
David Hurd, Director of Bone
Marrow Transplantation at NC
Baptist Hospital.

After dinner, Lee Albrecht, a
recent bone marrow recipient,
spoke to the group about his battle
‘with leukemia, his transplant, and
the emotional and spiritual impact
of the gift he received. The evening
was a special one for Albrecht,
who had met his donor Steve Willis

Rideout explains, “One of the most
important issues we face is tropi-
cal deforestation. Ifthe remaining
forests are not managed properly,
we face an incredible loss of bio-
diversity.. Many people do not
realize the importance of this bio-
diversity in our lives.”

Biology professor Linda
McNally will make a presentation
in early March concerning research
she has done on African honey-
bees and other environmental is-
sues in Kenya.

The EAC also plans to sched-
ule a presentation with the Raptor
Center, a Charlotte facility which
houses rehabilitated raptors, large
birds of prey. “Their presentation
includes the use of permanently
injured or non-releasable raptors

hopes to involve the community
kids in the planting process as a
part of educating them at an early
age,” Rideout explains.

Rideout has been very encour-

aged by the participation in the
EAC this year. “There has been
more interest in the EAC and more
people have been coming to the
meetings.”
