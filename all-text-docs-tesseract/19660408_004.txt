Netters Grab Three Wins
On Spring Vacation Tour

Coach Harry Fogleman ex-
pressed satisfaction in a large
portion of the ‘Cats’ play and
was impressed mainly by their
performance against Columbia.
“We did a good job against a
fine team in that one,"’ he noted.

The trip was concluded on a
sour note, as the netters went to
a heartbreaking 5-4 defeat at the
hands of Kalamazoo. The dou-
bles games decided this one,
with the third set of each dou-
‘les match played in near
darkness. Fogleman termed it
“a bad match, just one of those
things.””

The ‘Cats only Florida loss
came from a very strong Rol-
jins team, 7-2. Only Pinky
Hatcher could break through in

Linksters Lag
In Fla. Tourney

The Wildcat golf team spent
its spring vacation representing
Davidson in the Florida Invita-
tional Golf Tournament at Cape
Coral, Fla.

They placed lth among -18
of the top teams in the South
in the field. The University of
Florida took top honors, but was
closely followed by Louisiana
State and Florida State.

Medalist for the tournament
was National Amateur Cham-
pion Bob Murphy of the Univer-
sity of Florida. Champion Mur-
phy demonstrated just how tough
the gusty Cape Coral course

was by averaging two above the
par 72.

Of the six players Dr. Tom
Scott chose to accompany him,
Doug McKeever holed the low
score for the four-round tour-
ney with 315. He was followed
by Joe Jelks with 321 and Champ
Covingtotn with 330.

The ‘Cats next meet N. C.
State Thursday at the Charlotte
Country Club. Davidson has al-
ready beaten the Wolfpack ear-
lier and will meet them on the
fairways this second time sport-
ing a 4-1 record.

EMPHASIS ON THE FUTURE

Colonials Succumb, 7-1

The Wildcat baseball
team suffered four losses in
five games on its Florida
tour during Spring Break.

All was not in vain, how-
ever, since some of the play-
ers did manage to soak up
some good rays.

The baseball ‘Cats left Dav-
idson following a doubleheader
with VMI on Friday afternoon
and arrived at Statesboro, Ga.
at 1 p. m. Saturday afternoon.
The ‘Cats took on Georgia South-
ern in the second game of a
doubleheader for Southern, the
first of which Southern had
dropped to Wake Forest.

Gene Bennett pitched the first
six innings and was charged
with the loss. Bennett’s pitching
was not as bad as the 12-1 score
would indicate, since several
gross errors cost several runs.
Charlie Elliott relieved Bennett
and finished the game. Paul
Brown was Davidson's only

Davidsonian Sports Writer

Future athletic hopes for Davidson are
growing as four freshman spring sports,
baseball, track, tennis and golf, are under-
way with emphasis on developing help for
the varsity teams néxt year.

The freshman baseball team has start-
ed slowly, with no victories and three de-
feats, but Coach Tom Stevens is undaunted
and optimistic. The defeats, at the hands
of West Mecklenburg, Lincolnton and Gar-
inger high schools were not nearly as
crushing as past years’ losses.

Stevens said that there are several good
prospects for next years’ varsity squad and
emphasized the individual players. “We
have a lot of experience this year which
has been a great help to us. These boys
have played a lot of ball before coming here.
Usually we end up doing too much teach-
ing and don’t get to what we'd like to.

“Until this year there were not too
many who had played Legion ball or ball in
high’ school, but this year we have several
with high school and prep school experi-
ence. I’m sure that fall practice has helped
this year and will continue to help in the
future.”

Stevens spoke of several players who
could be of assistance next year. “Bill Love
and Macky Reavis are the only two players
with a lot of pitching experience. Pitching
will really be needed next year. Hank
Strickland is a good. possibility for a catch-
ing job. Ray Logan shows a lot of promise
as a hitter.’

Stevens said that Ronny Brown, Stew
Rrown, Hal Young, Tommy Poston and Dave
Fearnbach all have a chance in the infield,

but the team is mainly defensive and lacks
hitting. “We've had trouble with hitting
because of lack of batting practice. Time
and space limit us,” Stevens explained. The
outfield is dominated by Frank Murphy,
whose speed, range and throwing arm were
praised by Stevens.

__ The next scheduled contest for the
Wildkittens is against West Mecklenburg
Wednesday on the. Davidson ‘diamond.

The freshman track team holds a per-
fect 1-0 record as it defeated its only op-
onents, North Mecklenburg High, before
pring Break. Coach Heath Whittle’s group
will face their second contest tomorrow
when they travel to Greenville, S. C., to
compete in the News-Piedmont Relays.
Schools from throughout the area will be
competing as the Wildkittens will face other
college freshman teams and teams from
junior colleges.
Whittle hopes to place high with Greg
Cox participating in the 100-yard dash,
the broad jump, the 880 relay and the
‘print- medley relay. Roane Cross will throw
the discus and the shot. Bill Bryan will
throw the discus and Wayne Huckel will
throw the javelin. Mike Moats and Eddie
Rice will run legs of both the 880 relay and
the sprint-medley relay. ,
Hopeful of doing well, Whittle said.
“This should be a real interesting meet.
Soon we'll meet Myers Park which has a ter-
rific team this year and they'll be our tough-
est competition until we meet Wake Forest.”
Whittle had especially high praise for
Cox, who scored 214% points against North
Mecklenburg. Cox won the 100-yard dash,
the 220, the broad jump, the low hurdles

TENNIS

The freshman tennis team has had two
matches this year, being the victor in one
match and the victim in another.

Woodberry Forest defeated the David-
son netmen, but Belmont Abbey submitted
to the Harry Fogleman-Jeff Frank-coached
team. Steve Faulk, Judson McKellar, Al
Varner, Dale Vash, Bruce Weidner, Frank
Spence, Bert Cushman and Kim Nelson give
promise of continued success for Davidson
tennis, as experience is a major factor this
year.

Fogleman said that the biggest match
in the near future will be against the West-
minster School of Atlanta. “They're real
good, tennis-wise, and we'll be looking for-
ward to that one.” That match is next

Saturday. GOLF

The freshman golf team lost its first
match to Ashley High School of Gastonia.
Dr. Tom Scott said that Carey Hite, Mike
Spann and Dave Moser have shown excep-
tional prowess.

In their second match Wednesday, the
freshmen linksters gained a measure of re-
venge by beating Ashley 17-10 at the Gas-
tonia Municipal Golf Course. K. D. Weeks
and Hite defeated their opponents 7-1 as
Weeks shot a 73 and Hite fired a 71. Chip
Clark also won his match, and Spann ‘split.

The success and failure of the team
may depend on the number of participants.
Thus far only six have tried out for the
team, so the competition is not as rough as
it should be. Dr: Scott urged other fresh-
men who are interested to try out for the

Trailways mansion on wheels.

ROMP STETSON

Monday afternoon, the team
pushed its way through throngs
of retired wrinkles seated on
park benches, and finally ar-
rived at Stetson's ballpark. May-
be because Stetson is Baptist,
maybe because of the Daytona
Beach trip, maybe because
everyone was nice to the wrin-
kles, maybe because of a de-
sire to impress the honeys in
the stands, but undoubtedly for
some good reason, the ‘Cats
thoroughly demolished the Stet-
son Hatters.

Buddy Durham started on the
mound, and Charlie Elliott again
relieved in the late innings.
Durham received credit for the
11-4 win but true credit should
go to Skip Angelo “Jet Stream"
Waite who, when the ‘Cats had
yet. to score, lifted a pop-up into
the strong gale blowing out to-
ward left field and _ trotted
around the bases with a two-
run homer.

Angelo was assisted at the
plate by Bryant Hinnant who
went 3 for 5 with a triple and
4 RBI's and by Claude Owens,
whose two hits also included a
triple.

Sadly, the scheduled game for
the next day was cancelled be-
cause of rain. The ‘Cats, reluc-
tant to leave such a wonderful
place as Hotel. Putnam, hopped
on the wonderbus and rode to
Lakeland for two games with
Florida Southern.

KING HOMERS

Howard Bryan pitched the
first game, which was played
under the lights in Henley Park,
former spring home of the De-
troit Tigers. David King’s three-
run homer kept the ‘Cats ahead
until the bottom of the seventh
and eighth innings when a com-
bination of luck, scratch hits,
and Davidson errors enabled.
