"Remember Two Things" about the Dave Matthews Band

By Jon Sands
& Mandy Curtis

Finally, after almost a month
of waiting, the first Dave Matthews
Band CD was released. But where
is it available? The quest contin-
ued from Home Town to Repo,
until we were able to get our hands
onit from The Record Exchange in
Charlotte. ;

Now the fun part: Listening to
the band from Charlottesville, Vir-
ginia in the car on the way home to

Davidson. We’d all seen them
play this fall a bunch of times; but
to hear them on CD was something
different.
tracks and four in the studio with a
stereogram CD cover that you will
have to figure out yourself. En-
titled “Remember Two Things,” it
has live recordings done at Trax in
Charlottesville, the Flood Zone in
Richmond, and The Muse in Nan-
tucket, Rhode Island.

The members of the band in-

It consists of six live,

clude Dave Matthews, guitar and
vocals; Stefan Lessard, bass; Boyd
Tinsley, violin and vocals; Leroi

Moore, woodwinds and vocals; and.

Carter Beauford, percussion and
vocals. Truly, the unique sound, a
combination of instruments and
vocals, is captured on CD; but it is

_ also true that the CD can not possi-

bly do them justice as performers.

Anyway, ‘the two most dis-
tinctive features about the band,
besides Stephan, the hot bassist

Junior Mary Beth Crawford finds that the best way to make a contribution to the school is to
paint on the wall. In the Northeast stairwell of the Union, Crawford is currently placing a well-
crafted mural of the Union patio on two perpendicular walls. Although the painting is only half-
finished, it is easy to see that the artist has captured the spirit of a lazy sunny afternoon between

(Mandy speaking, of course), are
Boyd’s violin and Dave’s voice.
Boyd graduated from UVa, where
most of their following is located,
and can play a violin like never
seen or heard before.

For us, he brings new mean-
ing to an instrument we’ve always
thought sounded like something
you were forced to play when you
were in the little elementary school
band, Dave’s voice is the most
amazing because he’s got this
funky South African accent that
you can hear in his music. Okay,
okay; he’s pretty hot too. (Accord-
ing to Mandy)

What’ separates Dave
Matthews. from the rest of the
cheesy Velveeta-crap cover bands
(Did someone say the Root Doc-
tors?) is Dave’s skill as a lyricist.
He mocks society and brings a
cynical tone of humor to his music
that makes it extraordinary. In the
first track of the CD, “Ants March-
ing,” he states, “Candyman teas-
ing the thoughts of a Sweet tooth
tortured by weight loss.” Then he
goes on to remind you of the im-
portance of always being who you
want to be as he saysin “Seek Up,”
“Forget about the reasons and the
treasons we are seeking. Forget
about the notion that our emotions
can be swept away. Forget about
being guilty, we are innocent in-
stead. For soon we will all find our
lives swept away.”

There are many songs that
Dave fans might not have heard on
this debut CD. Due to the fact that
Dave has over forty songs, he is
practically ready to.put out a Box
set. But the truth is that he and his
gang are currently negotiating with
RCA for a contract. So the simple
fact that songs like “Grannie,”
“Warehouse,” and “Typical” did
not make the CD is that they are
waiting for a big studio and lots of
money to serve the songs justice.

The CD is a tribute to their
amazing live performances but
don’t think you can listen to the
CD and expect you know what the
show will sound like because the
ams J intros are cut out. So go

see them live. When Boyd Tinsley
lowers his cowboy hat over his
eyes and leans back and smiles his
grin of grins and electrifies the
crowd with his fiddle, it is a mo-
ment to be treasured.

When we saw them play at

’ The Vanripers Music Festival last

spring, which was held in the coun-
tryside outside of Charlottesville
with Allgood, Everything, The
Samples, they were hands down
the crowd favorite. Of course, this
is because it was held in the Dave
Matthews Mecca of the world.

Therefore, it was no coincidence

that the local band blew the others
out of the water.

. If you try to categorize them,
you can’t. It is a group that is
almost completely acoustic with-
out the electric bass. Clearly, they
have a message in their music.
There is the continuous theme of
“free spirit,” “free will,” and ap-
preciation for life.

But it is also important to note
that these guys aren't so bogged
down with sentiment and symbol-
ism that they don't have a good
time on stage with each other and
in interaction with the audience.
Much of what they are about, al-
though difficult to discern from
one CD, is that it all comes down to
the fact they are fun and a blast to
See, :
And if you do remember two
things about this article, one should
be to.get to Charlotte and buy the
CD and the second should be to try
to see them live.

They sometimes play at
Vanripers and Ziggy’s, they are a
sure thing at Trax in Charlottesville
every Tuesday, and the Flood Zone
in Richmondon Wednesday nights.
The lines in “Tripping Billies” are
a good summary of what kind of
spirit the band brings to the stage
and to the audience every time
they play.

It is simply stated: “So why
would you care; To get out of this
place; You and me and all our
friends; such a happy human race;
eat, drink, and be merry for tomor-
row we die.”
