Faculty, students reconsidering Humanities

By ANN CuLp
News Editor

Like most courses in
Davidson’s liberal arts curriculum,
the two-year interdisciplinary Hu-
manities program is intended to
“encourage and reward clear think-
ing, speaking, and writing,” accord-
ing to the course catalogue.

Long a Davidson academic
comerstone, the program’s reading
list encompasses Greek and He-
brew texts, the New Testament, lit-
erature from the Renaissance to the
American and French revolutions,
nineteenth-century diatribes and

twentieth-century manifestoes.

The 224 freshman and sopho-
mores who participate every year
receive course credit for religion,
philosophy, literature, history, and
compostion, with the participation
of 19 professors in 9 different de-
partments.

Now, particularly with the re-
cent release of an external study of
the program, some faculty and stu-
dents think that with so many dis-
parate resources and intentions, the
Humanities program is not able to
accomplish even a few of its goals,
much less all of them.

The program, which was be-

gun 27 years ago and has not been
evaluated for 15 years, was evalu-
ated by outside reviewers this year.
An official report was sent to Dean
of Faculty Williams on Thursday
and will be discussed by Humani-
ties staff on April 25.
“Any program needs to con-
tinue to reflect the interests, priori-
ties, and goals of the staff, and that
changes,” says Professor of English
and Humanities Gail Gibson.
Because Humanities embraces
so many departments, it is difficult
toconduct acomprehensive review.
“What is frustrating is that Humani-
ties is so large and bureaucratic. It

makesit more difficult than it should
be for the program to reflect current
interests, current staff,” says Gibson.

Over the summer, faculty will
be able to respond to the reviewers’
report and a strategic plan will be
drafted in the fall. Any potential
changes will be presented to the
Educational Policy Committee
(EPC) in December and the faculty
next March.

“Humanities is something you
have in common and there is some-
thing to be said for that. Folks who
have had Humanities have a new

Is FLAG in trouble?

Cancellation of Sexuality Forum leaves future of FLAG in question

By SARAH TEACHWORTH
Staff Writer

The last-minute cancellation of
the annual FLAG Sexuality Forum,
scheduled for March 27, was a big
surprise to the many students who
were planning to attend. The Col-
lege community is left wondering

_why the popular event was can-
celled and, more broadly, what the

cancellation means for the future of
FLAG.
Rob Knight, who was the chair-
man of FLAG for a year and a half,
explained that the five students who
intended to “come out” at the Fo-
rum changed their minds after care-
fully considering the consequences
of such a big step. The students
who were to speak determined that
concerns about their social interac-

10

tions and future careers were too
great to warrant going public with
their sexual orientations.

Knight says he found the can-
cellation of the forum to be "kind of
discouraging."

FLAG’s current chair, Valerie
Hansard, hopes that FLAG will be
able to re-organize the Sexuality
Forum for April 20. This time, she
says, they would like to get away

from the “coming out” aspect of the
event and bring in other types of
speakers. She hopes that the three
open gays on campus will speak
about how they have been treated
and she would like students who
have gay friends or family mem-
bers to speak about their experi-
ences. There is also an alumnus
who has agreed to speak about what

The last of three open forums
on the tuition benefits plan for chil-
dren of Davidson employees was
held this afternoon in Perkins Audi-
torium. It was the last opportunity
for members of the community to
voice their feelings publicly about

‘the policy before an advisory

council’s formal proposal will be
sent.to President Kuykendall rec-
ommending cuts of up to 30% in the
compensation package.

78 dependents of College em-
ployees take advantage of the
present tuition benefit plan. As of
now, what is termed the “Tuition
Waiver Program” “provides tuition
only for dependent spouse or chil-
dren who meet all admission. re-
quirements to Davidson College,”
according to the Faculty Handbook.
The “Tuition Grant Program” “pays
tuition and standard fees applicable
to all students for dependent chil-

__dren_attendin; accredited educa-
tional institutions other than

Davidson College, but in no case
more than 70 percent of the
Davidson College tuition cost for
that semester.” :

More simply, if the child or
spouse of a College employee who
had been working'at Davidson for
the required “vesting period” of
three years was admitted to
Davidson, 100% of -their tuition
would be waived. If they attended
a school other than Davidson, the
lesser of 100% of that school’s tu-
ition, or 70% of Davidson’s cost
could be applied toward fees at that
school.

The Advisory Council for Fi-
nance, Personnel and Development
(which is composed of six faculty
members, including Epes, two stu-
dents, the SGA President as an ex-
officio member, and an advisory
board made up of heads of related
administrative divisions) is now
proposing to limit tuition benefits
to full-time employees hired on or
before March 14, 1996 to 70% of
Davidson’s tuition for dependents
admitted to the College. For depen-
dents at other schools, 70% of
Davidson’s tuition or 70% of that
school’s tuition would be covered,
whichever is less.

In keeping the percentage the
same, even when costs are differ-
ent, the College reduces pressure
