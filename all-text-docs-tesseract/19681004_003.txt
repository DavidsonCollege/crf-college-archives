dents more aware of the

The program includes two
phases — the orientation of
freshmen and new, faculty
members and_ continuing

Research work for the
booklet is based on the re.

to schools. These schools
were asked to define lying -
cheating and stealing.

Williams said that he was
“very happy with the letter
response.”’ Some 30 schools

Fr University students
must be interested in learn-
ing for itself, according to
Free University Chairman
Rich Cowart.

Cowart. who sees the pro.
gram as ‘“‘the ideal educa-
tional setup," got the idea
from two University of North
Carolina students. The cur.
riculum consists of non cred-
it courses offered by quali-
fied faculty and student in.
structors.

Two courses are student-
inspired. Stagg Newman has
organized a poverty seminar
and sophomore Jimmy Trus.

ception,’ a study of birth
control.

In the political science
area, Jon W. Fuller discuss.
es ‘Temporary Affairs Week
by Week." and William
Jackson offers ‘“‘The Presi-
AMential Campaign Week by
Week.”

Dr. Frank Bliss heads a
photography course, and Rob-
ert Williams discusses ‘Art
Of The 60's."

Dr. Alan B. Brinkley will
lead a section in ‘‘American
Civil Liberties.’ Other class.
es include Dr. Ernest Patter-
son's course, ‘Revolution,’
and Dr. T. A. Williams’
course, **Parapsychology."

College chaplain Scott
Woodmansee will head a dis.
cussion in. ‘‘Group Dynam-
ies.”’

Boyte, Davidson, Hyder
Fill Administrative Posts

Three men, two of them
recent Davidson graduates,
have joined the college's ad-
ministrative staff.

Robert W. Davidson of
Mooresville holds the new
post of comptroller. James
W. Hyder, '66 was appointed
assistant dean of admissions
and Samuel F. Boyte assist-
ant director of the College
Union.

Slade announced that a

night before Homecoming, at
which time each freshman

Queens cheerleaders offer-
ed to reward the producers

The advisers also encour-

be worn by a cheerleader.
The cost was reported to be
about $400.

Ernst of Charlotte, was a
Phi Beta Kappa graduate of
the University. of North Car-
olina at Chapel Hill in 1952.
He received his Masters in
business administration there
in 1953.

The new position of comp-
troller was created in a re-
organization of the business
office in an effort to cope
with the college's expansion
and the bind that private col.
leges face in the future, said
Robert A. Currie, treasurer
and business manager.

“We are extremely fortu-
nate to have an administra.
tor of Mr. Davidson's abil-
ity,’ Currie said. “‘His rec.
ord and experience guaran-
tee continued progress in
Davidson College's adminis-
trative needs in the future.”

He said Davidson's duties
will include responsibilities
previously charged to Myron
W. McBill, bursar and as-
sistant treasurer for the past
46 years, who retires next
week.

Hyder joined the Admis-
sions Office staff last month
when his Army hitch ended.
During his undergraduate
days here, he was head bas-
ketball manager, an All-
Southern Conference baseball
player and a Dana Scholar.

Before his graduation from
Davidson last June, Boyte

committee to the class.

Handouts listing the funda-
mentals of the honor sys-
tem. definitions of terms,
court procedures and the
names and addresses of
court members, the defense
advisor and the chairman of
the investigating committee
were distributed to all fresh-
men.

“It's been unfortunate that
in the past, at least one
freshman has been dismiss.
ed for an honor violation
each year,’ Williams said.

‘“T don't know whether it's
been a lack of orientation (to
the honor system) or a lack
of cooperation,"’ he said, ‘’but
that's behind the work we're
doing right now.”

In addition to the freshman
orientation activities, Wil-
liams met with new faculty
members last week to pre.

esent the honor system and
court policies and procedures
to them.

Williams said that two
members of the court will
be meeting with all depart-
ment, heads and will attend
department meetings to ac-
quaint faculty members with
changes brought about by
the new student body con-
stitution.

The court will also ask
faculty members for their
policies of honor require-
ments for written assign-
ments and lab work.

in preparation for the pub-
lication of the honor court
booklet, members of the
court are, heading commit-
tees to prepare certain sec.

“NOT THAT WAY, IT’S OVER HERE”
Players rehearse for “The Bald Soprano.”

Tonesco’s ‘Anti - Play’
To Be Staged Thursday

The Davidson Community
Players will present Eugene
Ionesco’s comedy, ‘‘The Bald
Soprano,’" Thursday night at
8:15 in Hodson Hall.

“The Bald Soprano’ —
which Ionesco calls an ‘‘anti-
play’’—is a short work which
is one of the classics of the
modern theatre of the ab-
surd. By using apparently
empty conversation in a very
comic fashion, the author
deals with the tragedy of
failed communication among
people whose lives offer lit-
tle of variety or excitement.
* The production is directed
by Constance Welsh, wife of
Professor Wilmer Welsh of
the Davidson Music Depart-
ment. Featured in the cast
are Lucy Johnston, wife of

Dean of Faculty Frontis W.
Johnston; Ellen Winkler
(Mrs. J. S. Winkler): Win-
fred P. Minter and Charles
L. Cornwell, professors of po-
litical science and English:
Ralph Quackenbush, proprie-
tor of The Hub; and Bar.
bara Fagg, wife of Coach
Dave Fagg.

The Davidson Community
Players were organized in
the summer of 1965 by peo-
ple in the Davidson com-
munity interested in drama.
It bas since produced sev-
eral short plays and read-
ings.

The group originally per-
formed “The Bald Soprano”
in summer, 1966. and has re-

Few Opt
To Skip
ROTC

‘When the ROTC battalion
forms next week there will
be few freshmen missing
who are eligible for the army
program.

Col. Frederick B. Outlaw,
head of the ROTC Depart-
ment, said that ‘‘a half doz-
en’ freshmen have given
him a letter from their par-
ents requesting that they be
exempted from the required
ROTC program.

This method of being ex-
cused from ROTC was add-
ed last spring to a previous.
ly existing list at the Board
of Trustees meeting. The list
also includes those students
who have had previous mil-
itary or ROTC training, are
conscientious objectors or are
transfer students classified
as sophomores or higher..

Outlaw said the new oppor.
tunity to be excused from the
program was well publicized
by both. the ROTC Depart-
ment and the college. It was
mentioned in the Wildcat
Handbook, and Outlaw sent
two letters to freshmen ex-
plaining that parents who
objected to their sons’ re-
ceiving military training at
Davidson could have them
excused by simply writing a
letter to him before regis.

Lang Arraigned
In Double Arson

Jordie Lang, an organizer
for the Fayetteville Area
Poor People’s’ Organization,
has been charged with ‘‘con-
spiracy to perform felonious
burning and attempting ito
burn a building in at least
two indictments,’’ Fayette-
ville Superior Court Solicitor
Doren Berry: said last week.

Lang is a former Davidson
student.

Berry said the case would
probably be tried sometime
during the uperior Court ses-
sion beginning October 14.
There are five other. defend-
ants in the case.

Lang said he had been
working on improving hous-
ing and getting the city gov-.
ernment to do more for the
poor people in Fayetteville.

The indictment charges
Lang with throwing what
Berry described as a ‘‘Molo-
tov cocktail" against the of-
fice of the Cross Creek Hous.
ing Authority and with being
involved in a conspiracy in
which a similar firebomb
was thrown against the side
of a grocery store across the
street from the housing proj-
ect.

“It's an obvious frame.
up.’’ Lang said. He said the
city government has _ been
harassing him as long as he

had worked there.

“I didn’t think Davidson
boys did things like that,”
Berry said. ‘It really shock-
ed me."
