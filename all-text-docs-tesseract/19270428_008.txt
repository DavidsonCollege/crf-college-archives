Interprets Christianity

Workman Answers Question of |
“What Is Christianity?”

Dr.

Last Sunday evening the “Y” vesper

man, Dean of the School of Religion at |
the University of North Carolina. Dr.
Workman is himself a young man and, as |
such, had a forceful message to deliver
to the student body.

Dr. Workman was formerly of Henry’s

| College in Arkansas, of Emory Univer-
| sity, in Atlanta, Ga., and of the Southern ,
| Methodist University at Dallas, Texas.

He became noted for his ability in reli-
gious wofk, and in 1926, he was secured
by the University of North Carolina, to

| be head of their School of Religion. Dr. |

Workman took his text from the 16th
chapter of Matthew, the 15th and 16th
verses. He gave “The Birth Hour of
Christianity” as the subject of this pas-
sage, and “What Is Christianity,” as the

that the average man of today has a
mistaken conception of Christianity, and

Jesus’ day. Therefore the Lord had taken
them aside to teach them more about his
work and to prepare them to carry it on

Safe-guarding tobacco’s
priceless asset

PIPE
TOBACCO |

Tosacco that’s a veritable treasure, a
wealth of rich mellowness, worth its
weight in gold... deserves every possible
protection to assure its safekeeping. So,
the utmost precaution is taken to safe-
guard Granger’s priceless properties.

To prevent the loss of one bit of its
freshness, Granger is first packed in a
heavy-foil pouch... Then to be 100% on
the safe-side, this is sealed ‘am-TIGHT’ in
an extra outside-wrapper of glassine—
keeping the tobacco ‘factory-fresh’ till you
break the seal to load your pipe!

=> ~ ~% ~S SSS = S a. = % % SS SS

Our chemists say it is ‘an almost perfect
seal for tobacco condition’— protecting
tobacco better than any container except
the vacuum tin. Then, because it is much
less expensive than a. costly pocket-tin,
Granger's pocket-packet sells at just ten
reatest value ever offered

to pipe-smokers! Setueg:®
