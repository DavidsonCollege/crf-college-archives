Sanders has given previously
a rare edition of the works of
Shakespeare. His gift of fifteen
incunable leaves was received
by the Library just before
Thanksgiving.

While all these pages from
old books have diverse back-
grounds, the most interesting
leaf is from the first edition of
the King James Version of the
Holy Bible printed in 1611; ard,
it contains verses from the
thirty-first chaoter of Numbers.

Bishop’s Bible, printed in 1572. ;

along with a leaf from the
quarto edition (1612) of the
King James Version of the Holy
Bible. Both these sheets are in
good condition. although they
are somewhat yellowed.

The other leaves come from
many. different books, all print-
ed before 1600; with the ex-
ception of one. There is a leaf
printed by John Gutenberg,
credited with the invention of
the first printing press in 1460,
from the Catholicon of Baldus,
an early medical work.

Another page was printed by
one of Gutenberg’s pupils in
1476: this ieaf is a page from
Pliny’s Natural History, a book
believed to be the first printed
ia the Roman type now used in
modern printing Other leaves
are hand-colored'and have wood-
block cut pictures on them: the
colors have remained constant,
giving the entire leaf a very
attractive look.

The leaves are printed in
English, Latin, and German
and come from books about
religion, medicine, philosophy.
There is even a leaf from the

first dictionary ever printed— |

one of philosophy, put out in
Venice in 1482. The authors
of these leaves range from
lesser known men to writers
such as Petrarch, Boccaccio,
and Pliny.

There was some excitement

over the leaf from Boccaccio. It|
was printed in English in 1527,

and ,was from a book entitled
The Fall of Prices.
Since Boccaccio was so well-

known for his expositions. into,

the morals of the period. some
people reasoned that anything
translated into English so soon
must have a vivid and racy text:
these same people argued that
‘the harmless-sounding titlé was
an attempt to get by the roval
censors. As of yet no one has
read the leaf.

The donor of these leaves, Dr.
Charles B. Sanders. is the Di-
rector of the Sanders Diagnostic
Laboratory of Houston, Texas:

Nickel Introduces
YMCA Giff Fund

Dick Nickel, head of the
YMCA Gift Fund committee, in-
troduced the first ‘of ‘three
choices for the annual YMCA
gift fund project during as-
sembly Monday morning,

Nickel spoke of a proposed
contribution to the Internation-
al Christian University in Japan.
This university is expanding its
graduate program and needs

funds for faculty salaries. David-.

son contributions would help
supply these funds.

Two alternative projects are
these: (1) providing an anesthe-
sia machine for a Cambodian
hospital through Medico, a sub-
sidiary of CARE, and (2) con-
tributing toward a new dormi-
tory fer the University Concep.
cion in Chile. The old dorm was
destroyed by recent Chilean
earthquakes.

The gift fund committee of
the YMCA presented two of its
proposals, the Christian Univer-
sity faculty fund, and the Medi-
co project, during assembly
Monday and chapel Thursday.
The third recommendation will
be made next Tuesday. On that
Tuesday the student body will
vote on ‘its preference for this
year’s project.

On Wednesday, Dec. 5, the Y
will begin making collections
for the gift fund. This year’s
goal is $4,000. The two most
recent gift fund collections have
averaged about $3,400.

The annual gift fund sponsor.
ed by the Y is over 25 years
old. The 1961 collection bought
science equipment and library
books for Taejon College in
Korea.

Concerning this year's pro.
ject, chairman Nickel stated
“Considering the high quality
of the project and the larger
student body, we anticipate good
results.”

HAPPY TALK

As we all know, conversation is terribly important on a date.
When lulls in the conversation run longer than an hour or two,
one’s partner is inclined to grow logy—even sullen. But oc-
casionally one finds it difficult to keep the talk going, especially
when one is having a first date with one. What, then, does one do?

“If had it to do over again,
would | take Army R.0.1.6.?

My wife and I are in Panama at the moment. She likes
it. You know, Officers’ Club, dances—that sort of thing.
1 like it, too. But whether I stay in the Army or not, the
question is: Would I take Army R.0.T.C. if I had it to
do over again? Yes, I certainly would. In spades, I
didn’t realize how lucky I was. At the time I figured:
Okay, so I’ll get my degree—get an Army commission,
too, and pick up some extra money along the way! I
wasn’t the leadership type, I thought. I was wrong. Boy,
was I wrong! Looking back on it, I wouldn't trade the
leadership training I got for anything! Take my word
for it, leaders are made—not born! Whether I stay in

the Army or not, nobody

can take away what I’ve

learned. And let's face it, where can anybody my age
step out of college and walk into a standard of living this
good? Look, if you have already invested two years in
college ROTC, take it from me: Stick i out! It'll be
one of the smartest things you ever did. J say a0.”

Harlow Thurlow prepares. That is his simple secret: When
Harlow is going to take out a new girl, he makes sure in advance
that the conversation will not languish. Before the date, he
goes to the library and reads all 24 volumes of the encyclopedia
and transcribes their contents on his cuffs. Thus he makes sure
that no matter what his date’s interests are, he will have ample
material to keep the conversation alive.

Take, for example, Huarlow’s first date with Priscilla de
Gasser, a fine, strapping, blue-eyed broth of a girl, lavishly
constructed and rosy ns the dawn.

Harlow was, as always, prepared when he called for Priscilla,
and, ‘as always, he did not start to-converse inmedi:tely. First
he took her to dinner because, us everyotic knows, it'is useless
to try to make conversation with an unfed coed. Her attention
span.is negligible. Also, her stomach rumbles so loud it is diffi-
cult to make yourself heard. ,

ash yur cand Te ty Jae!"

So he took her to a fine steak house where he stoked her with
gobbets of Black Angus and mounds of French fries and thiok-
ets of escarole and battalions of petit fours. Then, at last,
dinner was over and the waiter brought two finger bowls.

“T hope you enjoyed your dinner, my dear,” said Harlow,
dipping into his finger bowl.

“Oh, it was grandy-dandy!” said Priscilla. “Now let’s go
someplace for ribs.”

“Later, perhaps,” said Harlow. “But right now, I thought
we might have a conversation.” .

“Oh, goody, goody, two-shoes!” cried Priscilla. “I been
looking everywhere for a boy who can carry on a intelligent
conversation.” .

“Your search is ended, madam,” eaid Harlow, and pulled
back his sleeves and looked at his cuffs to pick a likely topic to
start the conversation.

Oh, woe! Oh, lackaday! Those cuffs on which Harlow had
painstakingly transcribed so many facts—those cuffs on which

e had noted such diverse and fascinating information—those
cuffs, I say, wero nothing now but a big, blue blur! For Harlow
—poor Harlow!—splashing around in the finger bowl, had gotten
his cuffs wet and the ink had run and not one word was legible!
And Harlow—poor Harlow!—looked upon his cuffs and broke
out in a night sweat and fell dumb.

“I must say,” said Priscilla after several silent hours, “that
you are a very dull fellow. I’m leaving.”

With that she flounced away and poor Harlow was too
crushed to protest. Sadly he sat and sadly lit a cigarette.

All of a sudden Priscilla came rushing back. “Was that,” she
asked, “2 Marlboro you just lit?”

“Yes,” said Harlow. .

“Then you are not a dull fellow,” she cried, and sprang into
his lap. ‘You are bright! Anybody is bright to smoke such a
perfect joy of a cigarette as Marlboro which is just chock full
of yummy flavor, which has a Selectrate filter which comes in a
soft pack that is really soft, and a Flip-Top Box that really flips,
and which can be bought wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty
states and Duluth . . . Harlow, tiger, wash your cuffs and

be my love.”
“Okay,” said Harlow, and did, and was.
