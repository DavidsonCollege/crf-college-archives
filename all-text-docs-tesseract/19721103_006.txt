The Davidsonian

Novel

By TOM BRUCE
Contributing Editor

The opportunity to study in a
foreign setting while attending
Davidson is being planned and
packaged in a number of novel
ways

Davidson's standard Jumor
Year Abroad program was
started in the early 1960's
Today 14 students are studying
at the University of Montpeher
in France. while 14 others are
working at the University of
Marburg in Germany

Besides these well-known
options. there are a number ot
planning-stages offerings. plus
some other programs already
In operation at Davidson

The history and English
departments offer courses at
Saint Anne's College in Oxtord.
England under the advisorship
of a Davidson faculty member
The Classics department offers
a seminar taught on location in
Greece and Italy

Possibilities for the
immediate future include the
expansion of the Junior Year
Abroad program to include a
vear in India at the University
of Baroda. According to Paul
Fisher. Director of
International Education. “We
are at a temporary impasse
with with the Baroda program

“Every step toward final
approval ot the program has
been made The  Vice-
Chancellor in India is quite keen
on the program

“We dont want to be too
traditionally oriented toward

. Western Europe We are willing

to negotiate programs in
Africa. Japan, Latin America.
and in other places

“Sometimes we tend to look
farthest away when we talk
about foreign study. We might
want to look into Mexico .or
Canada. since they. are known
to be worthwhile as well as
accessible.’ Fisher stated.

A study of urban civilizations
abroad is also a possibility. This
program would emphasize
comparative aspects’ of
development in cities in Europe
and the United States.

The Religion department is
seeking to investigate a short-
term seminar in Israel that
would focus on the Christian

tradition and cultures

Bevond this. students are
planning semesters and vears
at schools where Davidson does

not offer programs. The
African-American Institute in
New York currently places

students in various universities
in Black Africa. It is a non-
profit organization specializing
in Africa) Atrican languages.
social science. and natural
sciences are ottered

At) this) point the two
programs in Europe in France
and Germany are at a low point
as tar as numbers of student
participants) Fisher attributes
this to routine changes in
attitude from class to class

“Some ot the students seem
caught up in isolationism. Many
of them are quite-career-
minded and are trying to
compile the best grades that
they can at Davidson and they
don't teel that this is possible
through toreign study Some ot
them don't teel that they
possess much __ linguistic
ability.’ Fisher said

Certain academic majors are
difficult to pursue in European
universities The French and
German schools have limited
laboratory resources and they
feel obligated to offer first dibs
on them to their native
students. Next in priority come
students trom developing
nations. Americans planning
majors in pre-medicine.
biology. physics. or chemistry
probably cannot be
accomodated

“students at Davidson work
around this by planning their
sophomore vear schedules very
caretully and even attending
summer school in some cases

“They use the credits they
earn in France and Germany to
meet area requirements and to
enrich their records.” Fisher
remarked.

Some veterans of the Junior
Year Abroad in past years have
suggested that it be made a
“sophomore year abroad” suv
that students can devote their
final two years to very close
work with the Davidson faculty
in their major areas of study.

“I can think of some good
reasons to change it.’ Fisher
said. *‘From our point of view at
Davidson it might be very

valuable The European
universities want American
transfers to have reached at
least the jumor vear. though
They feel that this gives them
more equivalent experience to
compete with French and
German students

“We are making exceptions
to handle seniors and students
who have only one semester to
study abroad. in some cases.”
Fisher added “We want the
programs to be tlexible and. in
some respects. custom-made ~

Davidson has no current
plans to establish a Davidson
campus permanently in some
international setting Some
universities such as Stantord
have set up extension Campuses
in European cities

“The branch-campus tormat

reduces the incentive to
integrate into the foreign
culture.” Fisher explains.

“Students congregate with
other Americans and live in a
style essentially like the one to
which they are accustomed in
the United States.

‘Under our system the
students ‘go native.”’ mixing in
with the local inhabitants and
observing French or German
customs and life styles."

Davidson might consider
establishing a branch-campus if

short-term foreign studies
became more popular “This
might be feasible if the whole
junior class intended to study
abroad. They could go over with
a minimum of language
preparation and then make
learning the language and

culture a main objective.’

Fisher re-emphasized. “We
want to stay without current
programs and at the same time
broaden the various opttions so
that more and more students
will be attracted to studying
abroad.”

Expense And Course Credit
For Foreign Study Explained

By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

Director of International
Education Paul Fisher last
week explained the details on
course credit and finances for
the JYA programs in France
and Germany.

Fisher said that up to this
point, all who have requested
credit for their courses taken
under the JYA program have
received credit. He explained
that all evaluation of the
students’ work is now done here
at Davidson after they return in
the fall. Fisher admitted.

however, that the present
system is awkward

“Of course. the most logical
person to evaluate a student's
performance is the teacher.’ he
said. However. because of their
different structures. French
and German universities are
not used to evaluate students
on each course. Fisher
explained.

According to Fisher, under
the present system. after the
student enrolls at Montpellier
or Marburg. a letter is sent back
to Davidson listing the courses
he is taking.

The chairmen of the
appropriate departments either
makes suggestions to the

complete. or will place the

The corresponding figures for
Germany are $130 to $160 per
month. The total cost for
Germany is higher because
students stay there for 10 to 11
months, as opposed to eight and
a half to nine months in France.

“The amount we've
suggested has always been
adequate. usually with some
left over for travel,’ Fisher
said. He pointed out that the
total cost of either program is
close to the cost of a year at
