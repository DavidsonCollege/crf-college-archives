Social Council Slate

Tan and Sylvia, the Righteous
Brothers, Dionne Warwick and
the Four Seasons will headline
two concert weekends and Home-
coming dur‘ng first semester.

Sponsored by the Social Coun-
cil, entertainment for concert
weekends and the Homecoming
weekend varies the program of-
fered by the College Union and
its social committee. The Social
Council has also scheduled com-
bo parties and local ensertain-
ment which will supplement the

Thornton Sisters,
Buffet Featured

A buffet supper and a combo
party will open the fall social
activities of the College Union
tomorrow.

For freshmen the day will in-
clude a computerized mifter with
Converse.

The Thornton Sisters, a com-
bo composed of a mother and
her five daughters, will play
from 7 until 11 p.m. in Cham-
bers basement.

A buffet supper at the Union
will follow the George Washing-
ton game. Tickets, at $1 each,
are available to any Davidson
student at the Union desk
through tonight.

For the mixer, many fresh-
men will be matched with their
dates by the college's IBM com-
puter, which was also used for
the oreyious mixer with Queens.

big-name groups.

Ian and Sylvia, who sing both
modern and traditional folk mu-
sic, will star on the first con-
cert weekend Oct. 1. Their con-
cert will be preceded by a buf-
fet supper and followed by a
combo party featuring Casper
and the Ghost Riders.

On the afternoon of the Ian
and Sylvja_ concert, Davidson
students and groups from area
colleges will sing at a hootenan-
ny and folk music contest. Vince
Foster, chairman of the Social
Council, stated that a cash prize
will be awarded to the best folk
or bluegrass group.

Homecoming. the biggest
weekend of the semester, will
offer the Righteous Brothers
show and Dionne Warwick on
the nights of Oct. 28-29.

For the first night’s entertain-
ment, Foster explained that
“this is not just the Righteous
Brothers. They will be bringing
their own band and a three-act
show.” A combo party with the
Manhattans and later a break-
fast in the Union will follow the
show.

Diorne Warwick will appear
in a concert Saturday night. Fol-
lowing her concert, there will
be a combo party featuring the
Entertainers.

For the Righteous Brothers
show, an admission fee will be
charged. The yearly $30 social
fee that each student pays is
inadequate to cover the cost of
top recording stars such as the

Righteous Brothers. Tickets for
the cencerts will be sold to 42a-
vidson students ‘‘at a reduced
price,”’ Foster said.

When asked whether the So-
cial Council planned to charge
admission to any other concerts
during the year, Foster said,
“It depends on how well this
goes off. If we lose a lot of
money on the Righteous Broth-
ers show, we'll probably have to
charge admission to a concert
next semester.”

The Four Seasons will sing at
the second concert weekend, No-
vember 19. A combo party will
follow the concert.

Hike Blamed On Plants

College Business Manager R.
A. Currie this week blamed a
highly competitive labor market
for an increase in students’
laundry fees and a decrease in
‘dormitory jenitorial services.

Currie said these two changes
came about as a result of rapid
industrial growth in the area
which has forced the college to
revamp its wage structure for
non-academic employees.

“The industries around here
were paying their employes
more money and requiring them
to work fewer hours than we
were,” Currie said. ‘Naturally

Three basketball players with
“other, more important activi-

:| ties’” have dropped off Coach
Charles (Lefty) Driesell’s inex-

perienced and already-thin var-
sity. .

Bobby Lane, Cecil Clifton and
Sam Hatcher—all juniors—this
week made official their inten-

:| tions of quitting the squad, which

begins practice Oct, 15.

Another junior, George Leight.
declined comment on rumors
that he, too, will quit.

Responded Driesell: ‘‘We cer-
tainly won't close up the bas-
ketball program.”

Lane, from New Orleans, La.,
was the only starter in the group
last season, averaging slightly
over 10 points a game. Hatcher,
from Columbus, Ga., and Clif-
ton, of Avondale Estates, Ga.,
were reserves.

Both Lane and Clifton will
forfeit full scholarships. Hatch-
er did not hold a_ basketball
scholarship, and neither does.
Leight.

Driesell dismissed as a ‘‘nor-
mal turnover’’ the loss of the
which diminishes the
ranks of his defending Southern
Ccaference champions to 12, in-
cluding the doubtful Leight.

He said that a turnover in per-
sonnel is to be expected each
year and noted that last year's
squad fost four potential play-
ers, too. ‘I’m confident we'll be
able to fill these guys’ places,”
he said.

With Leight’s status uncertain,
Driesell is left with only two def-
inite holdovers from last year,
juniors Rodney Knowles and

there was a real danger that
we would lose some of our em-
ployes to them."

Faced with this competition,
Currie said, the college began
work last fall cn a formal wage-
salary program for non-academ-
ic employes. This program in-
volved job analyses, job evalua-
tion, and job pricing, and includ-
ed. three different employment
classifications: maintenance and
custodial, laundry, and office
and clerical.

The program resulted in an
over-all salary increase for non-
academic employes and a re-
duction in the work week from

Tom Youngdale. The only other
player with any Davidson var-
sity experience is Scott Sinnock,
who did not play last year. Sev-

ed. Maybe he will change his
mind. I don't care—that’s up to
him. He had a lot of talent, but
we've got a lot of boys who

are eager ‘to take his place."

In a brief, prepared state-
ment, Lane said:

“I appreciate the experience
I have had in the years I have
played basketball. However,
there are other activities to
which I want to devote more of
my time and energy which
would be impossible to do if I
continue playing basketball."

He did not elaborate.

Clifton said, ‘‘I don’t enjoy

Sixteen Newcomers
Join College Family

Nine new teachers and seven
new staff members have been
‘added to the faculty and admin-
istration for the 1966-67 academ-
ic year, according to Dr. Fron-
tis W. Johnston, dean of the fac-
ulty.

George E. Core and L. P. Per-
cy join the English department.

The ROTC department has
added Capt. Donald A. Johns
and Maj. R. H. Schuessler.

P. C. Fisher joins the German
department as an instructor. J.
P. Traywick is a new instructor
in classical languages.

H. D. Woodfin joins the His-
tory department.

R. H. Williams will be an in-
structor of art.

Returning from _ sabbatical
leaves are T. F. Clark in the
Bible and religion department
and C. E. Ratliff in the econom-

45 to 40 hours.

Coupled with these changes,
Currie said, has been the neces-
sity in recent years of increas-
ing the college's maintenance
and custodial staff in order to
cover the needs of an expanding
physical plant and to provide for
the increasing demands of the
instructional program. —

“Our budget wouldn't allow us
to pay an expanding non-aca-
demic staff according to the
new wage saale. Therefore, in
order to keep tuition and fee in-
creases at a minimum during
this period of increased labor
cost, we have tried to eliminate

“One of these appeared to be
janitors making beds in the dor-
mitories. Consequently, we laid
off some of the dormitory jani-
tors.”

Some fee increases, however,
appeared to be necessary, he
said, such as the laundry fee in-
crease from $12.50 to $50 per
semester.

Currie said that the tight la-
bor market caused the cost of
laundry operation to increase
out of proportion to laundry
prices. The college considered

President D. Grier Martin an-

riculum revision committee at
a faculty meeting this week.

The four are Professors Joe
Embry (French), Charles Rat-
liff (economics), Earl MacCor-
mac (philosophy) and James G.
Martin (chemistry).

Four other members of the:
faculty, Professors Locke White
(physics), Frank Bliss (Eng-
lish), Max Polley (Bible and re-
ligion), and Jay Ostwalt (psy-
chology and education) were
elected to committee member-
ship after the curriculum’ study
was proposed by Dr. Frontis W.
Johnston, dean of the faculty,
early in April.

They have completed their ori-

this system.

“a great group of boys,”’ said
the class was well characterized
by “their firm handshakes and
their friendly manner.”

He cited the lack of interfer-
ence with the orientation pro-
gram by returning upperclass-
men as a helpful factor. He also
menticned that hall unity, a very
important part of this classs,
was exhibited especially in the
boys’ enthusiasm about the
freshman intramural program.
Explaining the low number of
freshmen, Dean Burts said that
there are more returning uper-
classmen than usual.

On the negative side. Fresh-
man Advisor Bill Rikard men-
tioned that perhaps the orienta-
tion was a little too long this
year. There are possible plans
to combine it with the ‘Y"' camp
next ‘year.

“Freshmen have been ready
to go to class since Sunday
morning,”” he observed, ‘‘and

serve as chairman, plans to
study the present curriculum
and recommend changes in
what Dr. John Kelton, professor
of psychology. has predicted will
be a ‘‘major overhaul of the cur-
riculum.”

The committee ‘has not even
met yet,’ according to John-
ston, but ‘‘exploraticns have be-
gun."

“As a committee, it will get
under way this fall,’ he con-
cluded.

Johnston's original proposal
grew out of the college's self-
study report which was publish-
ed last year and the subsequent
visit by representatives of the
Southern Association of Colleges
and Universities.

When he presented the pro-
posal, Johnston said that all
areas of the curriculum will be
subject to study and possible re-
vision.

CHECK REQUIREMENTS

He mentioned that major-mi-
nor requirements and gradua-
tion requirements in general will
be examined with particular
care.

The committee will begin work
this fall and work throughout
the academic year. Any changes
will not go.into effect before the
fall of 1967, according to John-
ston.

The result will be that while a
change in major-minor require-
ments could affect both the
present freshman and _ sopho-
more classes, any change in
graduation requirements could
affect only the freshmen.
