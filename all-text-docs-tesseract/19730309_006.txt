Borch has always been in

studies project. he decided to
tly to San Diego. Calif. via U.S.
Army to study dolphins.

“My goals.’ he said. ‘were
first of all to get to San Diego,
and then to get inside the
laboratories controlled by the
Navy and find out first hand
what is being learned about the
dolphin."

Borch had all his
arrangements taken care of for
him by the Davidson ROTC
Department.

“The officers wrote letters
and made phone calls and cut a
lot of ‘red tape’ for me,” he
reported. ‘‘Finally, I was
cleared to fly to San Diego on a
military transport plane-slow,
noisy, but free.”

Borch was involved in a week
long experiment with the
dolphin at the Naval Undersea
Research and Development
Center: Bio-Science Facility.

“This experiment,’’ he con-
tinued, ‘‘was the study of the
dolphins’ echolocation
threshold. Echolocation is the
sonar process of the dolphin.

“The threshold," Borch ex-
plained, ‘‘is the point at which
the dolphins echolocation is no
longer accurate."’

“This mamma! tinds it easy
to recognize any logical pat-
tern. The scientists had to be
caretul to not set up any pat
tern which the dolphin could
see. because if he found the pat
tern. he would stop using his
sonar and just follow the scien-
tific routine.

Borch said. ‘‘Their brain is a
kind of ‘computer-inventors’
dream. They can send out sonar
waves and have them analyzed
before one one-hundreth of a
second has passed, which is
much faster than any com-
puters rate of analyzation."

Ten years is a long time. In
the world of popular music,
where trends, stars and for-
tunes can be made or broken in
weeks, it is an unbelievably
long time.

Only one group has been able
to hack it for 10 years in the
limelight. Other bands have
been around as long, but so far
only one band has survived
their first recorded efforts by a
full decade. The Beach Boys.

The Beach Boys had records
on the charts a year before the
Beatles made it in America.

Borch is planning another ex-

they are still with us.

The Beach Boys have been
able to ‘‘stand the test of time’
both because they have been
producing a fine musical
product which is as close to
“‘timeless’’ as pop music can
be, and, more importantly, they
seem to have an uncanny in-
stinct for survival.

After the first British in-

popular favor; they were

Hail Richard, Full Of Grace,
Have Mercy, We Have Sinned

By MARY HOBBIE
Contributing Editor

Hail Richard, full of erace,

have mercy ©. us for we
have sintieq.

I wish to propose a new
organization to be formed im-
mediately. Following a glorious
precedent, I propose to support
the manufacture of silver and
copper bracelets.

Each bracelet will have in-
scribed on it a name and a date.
The bracelets will be worn for
memorial purposes.

The bracelets will remind all
who wear them or see them of
the plight of 68,000 Americans.

These are the young men who
left the United States, or serve
time in prison, or deserted
rather than fight in a war which
they believed to be immoral.

These men are the POWs of
today and tomorrow. They are
prisoners of war because they
acted according to conscience.

The name of each POW vill
be inscribed on the bracelet.
Underneath the name will be
the date on which the POW left

the U. S.. or the date he left the
armed forces. ;
If he is serving in prison, the
date on which he was sentenced
will be inscribed.
The organization should give
out bracelets bearing the names

only of those men who wish to
return to the United States. It is
for thein that the organization
would exist.

Contributions to the new POW
organization will be used to
defray the costs of manufac-
ture, publicity for the
organization, and expenses for
an amnesty’ lobby in
Washington.

The people who wear the new
POW bracelet will engage to
wear the bracelet until their
POW returns to his family, or
until their arm falls off.
Whichever comes first.

This is an effort which must
be made. We can't allow these
patriots to be forgotten. The
POW organization will promote
interest in the plight of these
courageous citizens.

The organization may even-
tually expand to production of
bumper stickers. ‘Don't forget
our POWs" is a possible slogan.
The color scheme will be red.
white and blue.

Unless this effort is made. the
American people will continue
to believe that the ends in Viet-

nam have justified the means.

They have not.

The wholesale bombing of
North Vietnam was not and
could never be morally right.
The murder of civilians is not
‘‘honorable."’

When ‘‘peace with honor"’ is
so glibly claimed, I cringe for
the honor of my country.

It is impossible to have a war
that has continued dishonorably
and immorally for years end
morally and with honor.

Therefore, I propose this new
POW organization to show sup-
port for those men who refused
to accept a role founded on a
sham honor.

If amnesty is not granted to
those men who acted according
to their consciences, we may
find ourselves mouthing
prayers to our nation’s plastic
honor.

There will soon be a hot
business in such prayers as the
one with which this article star-
ted:

Hail Richard, full of ****,
have mercy on us for we
have sinned.

TAKING DAVIDSON IN STRIDE

Mrs. Frankie Hutton, professor of freshman English at Johnson C.
Smith University has introduced an extended studies course in
journalism winter term at Davidson.

Beach Boys Endure Time Test

mindless lyrics and dancing, so
few people paid any attention to
them after 1966.

Sometime around 1967, the
Beach Boys became, of all
things, underground stars with
albums like *“‘Wild Honey" and
‘Sunflower ’”’.

The album ‘Pet Sounds,”
along with band leader Brian
Wilson, achieved mythological
Status.

The band persevered, and
during the past two years they
have produced two albums that
put m back on top of the
rockpile—‘‘Surf's Up"’ and now
‘‘Holland"’.

The former album brought
some media attention back to
the band and turned a new
audience onto their music;
‘‘Holland"’, their most recent
work, continues the Beach
Boys’ experiments with their
unique approach to popular
music.

There has always been a
‘‘Beach Boys’ Sound’. It was
not the ‘‘West Coast Beach

Music” it is lumped with—the

primitive rock and roll of Jan -

and Dean or the Surfaris.

Rather it was an approach to
rock that emphasized clean, in-
telligent production, heavy on
group vocals and laid-back,
emotional music.

After their early Chuck Berry
ripoffs, very few of the band's
songs had reference to dance
ability or the “car music" of
Top 40 radio.

Instead, they were ex-
periments with a blantet of
vocal and instrumental sound
that enveloped and seduced the
listener.

Only the Motown performers
of the mid-sixties, Phil Spector,
and Harry Nilsson have been
able to use human voices as ef-
fectively, and as lushly, as the
Beach Boys.

Luckily, the Beach Boys

managed to avoid the sacharine
stylization that inflicted the
Detroit producers, and most of
the excesses of Spector.

They kept their music firmly
rooted in rock aad roll, and
never sacrificed rock in-
strumentation or rhythmic
punch for the effect of layers
of strings.

‘‘Holland’’ continues the
band's experiments with this
type of music. It features all the
best of the Beach Boys’ style,
especially their fine vocal har-
monies and_ instrumental
arrangements.

Like any Beach Boy album,
Holland” is not without fault.
“Mt. Vernon and Fairway", a
short fairytale scored by Brian
is a throwaway, a mildly in-
teresting production piece that
loses interest after a couple of
listenings.

Despite this egocentric ‘‘ex-
tra"’ (it is packaged as a single,
and removable), the rest of
‘Holland’ is an enjoyable
record, that bears repeated
listenings.

‘Holland’ is essentially a
peaceful album. It is as quiet
and dignified as the Dutch canal
on the cover or the lone cow on
the back. This album won't
save the world or turn the rock
world upside down, but the
music is as good as any I've
heard recently. Sail on, Beach
Boys.
