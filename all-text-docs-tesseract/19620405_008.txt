New Campus Vision Rises
From Old Chambers Ashes

Davidsonian Staff Writer
So much has Davidson changed in 48 years, that the

ca

si cant buildings still stan
are Phi and Eu Halls, Oak and

us of 1914 would be unrecognizable today. The only

that were present then
Rows, and the guest

house, a gift of Andrew Carnegie, which at that time

housed the library.

The old Chambers Building,
built by a $250,000 bequest of
the late Maxwell B. Chambers in
1858, burned to the ground on
Nov. 28, 1921, after it was dis-
covered on fire at 5 a.m. that
morning. THE DAVIDSONIAN
of Dec. 2, 1921, states that, as
Chambers burned, “with heads
bared, and with the fire°of de-
termination in their spirits, the
students sang ‘O Davidson’.”

KICK-OFF FUND

Wnder the leadership of Presi-
dent W. J. Martin, the college
immediately kicked off a fund
raising campaign for a bigger
and better Davidson.

On Oct. 19, 1922, THE DAV-
IDSONIAN printed the first
artist's concept of New Cham-
bers. The picture shows the pro-
posed building to be very simi-
lar to present day Chambers,
with the exception that the
north and south wings are
drawn without their ‘‘T’’ shapes.

At this time, a student com-
mittee was chosen to head a
$600,000 fund drive, $400,000 of

which was to go towards financ-
ing Chambers. By 1924 the col-
lege was able to start construc-
tion of the south wing, and by
1928 the north and central por-
tions.
WATTS FIRE

In the meantime, Watts, East,
and West (Cannon) Halls were
constructed. On Feb. 25, 1923,
Watts was razed by a fire and
rebuilt the following summer.

Construction began on Rich-
ardson Stadium in 1926, with
the construction of the central
portion. In 1931 the south side
was added, and in 1936 the East
section was built to complete
the stadium.

BIG PLANS

In May, 1937, a centennial
program committee of the col-
lege listed the following build-
ings as being necessary and
their approximate costs: infirm-
ary, $25,000; library, $100,000;
field house, $150,000; social cen-
ter, $75,000; science building,
$125,000; dormitory, $100,000;
and a church, $225,000.

During Dr. Walter Lingle’s
administration the Martin
Science Building, Preyer Infirm-
ary, Gray Memorial Library, and
Duke Dormitory were construct-
ed. In 1941 Dr. Cunningham be-
came president, and during his
term the campus as we know it
took shape. Five major build-
ings were built: Johnston Gym-
nasium, Belk Hall, the David
Ovens College Union, Little

Hall, and the Church.

In 1957 construction was be-
gun on the Patterson Fraternity
Court. There had been much dis-
cussion whether to build single
units or cheaper duplexes, with
THE DAVIDSONIAN fighting
for the single units: “If a new
court is worthwhile, then it is
worth building right.”

DANA GIVES

By 1958 the new court had
been built, along with the Bab-
cock wing to the library and the
present Post Office, which the
college leased to the federal
government.

On Oct. 2, 1958, work was be-
gun on the Dana Science Lab-
oratories, in 1959 on Richardson
Dormitory, and in 1960 on the
Cunningham Fine Arts Center.

The vision of Presidents Cun-
ningham and Martin have
heourht Davidson a long way
from the smoking ruins of Old
Chambers in 1921.

Paper Wages Long Fight
To Abolish Faculty Oath

: BY TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonian Steff Writer

The faculty oath—Is it
right? Is it a wise require-
ment? This has long been a
controversial topic in THE
DAVIDSONIAN pages.

Each member of the faculty
must be a member of an evan-
gelical church, according to the
requirements for the faeulty
which Part II, Article IV, Para-
graph 81 of the Charter and By-
Laws of the Trustees of David-
son College spells out.

THREE ‘YEAS’

The “commitment to evange-
lical Christianity” requires each
full professor to give an affir-
mative answer, when he is in-
augurated during the annual
commencement, to each of three
questions:

“Do you acknowledge Jesus
Christ as Lord and Savior, and
do you believe in.the fundamen-
tal teachings “of evangelical
Christ'anity? Do you. believe
the Scriptures of the Old and
New Testaments to be the word
of God, the only infallible rule

faith and practice? Do you

in the humble reliance

the grace of God, which

by the Holy Spirit, so to

live and teach as to give expres-
sion to the Christian faith?”

In 1958, the newspaper polled
62 faculty members about the
rule. They favored three to one
the rule that all the faculty be
members of some evangelical!
church. They also favored 22-18
the oath at commencement. One
noted, however, “These ques-

tions could be put to a man at
the time of initial employment.
They certainly do not belong at
a commencement exercise be-
fore a strange audience.”

FIVE PROPOSALS

THE DAVIDSONIAN of Oct.
24, 1958, followed up with five
proposed changes. First, the
paper felt that the rule requir-
ing the college president to be
a Presbyterian should be modi-

stand in order to keep closely
related to the church.

The paper argued back,
“Many professors can take the
oath only by interpreting it in
such a way as to fit their parti-
cular beliefs,” making them
hypocrits. Moreover, “right and |
freedom are different . . . David-
son has the freedom to require

any oath it sees fit, but it does |
not necessarily have the right.” |

Athletes Of The

(Continved From Page Seven)
which stood at Davidson for
many years.

One of the oldest sports at
Davidson is wrestling, and
Harold “Westy” Westervelt
stands above all Davidson mat-
men. Undefeated in three years
of varsity competition, “Westy”
was Southern Conference
champion in the 157 pound class
in 1957, 1958, and 1959. He was
157 pound champ in the Caro-
linas AAU meet in 1957 and
1958, and in the Georgia AAU
meet in 1958. Westervelt was
named “most outstanding wrest-
ler” in all three meets. He was

‘Finest Rank’

also a fine end on the football
team, and was named to the All-
Conference Academic team two
years.

There are many other great
names in the annals of David-
son's sports history, but space
has not allowed us to mention
them all. A few of these other
notable stars are Dick Grey
and Thad Brock, both gridiron
greats, and Hobbie Cobb and
Witt Cobb, outstanding basket-
ballers of the past 20 years. It
is easy to see that sports writers
could always find something to
write about with these boys
around.

fied to become only a statement
of policy that could be changed.

Secondly, the evangelical
church membership rule should
be altered and made more flexi-
ble to allow men of other relig-
ions or none at all to teach here.
Thirdly, the college should not
require that 75 per cent of the
professors be Presbyterians. |

As a fourth point, the paper)
wanted the special rules for the |
Philosophy and Bible Depart-|
ment revoked to allow broader
religious and non-religious af-
filiations.

NO OATH

|

Finally, THE DAVIPSONIAN |

advocated doing away with the |

faculty oath because, “Such an/

oath is a standing barrier to!

many well qualified men who!

otherwise woul? come to David- |
son.”

The oath had also been hotly
debated in THE DAVIDSONIAN
of 1952. Dean C. K. Brown sup-
ported it for two main reasons,
tradition and “right.” He em-
phasized the oath dated from

the earliest days of the college
