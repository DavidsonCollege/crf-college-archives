This is another in an ongoing se-
ries of articles commemorating the fifth
anniversary of the men’s soccer team’s
miraculous run to the 1992 NCAA Fi-
nal Four at Richardson Field.

Some championship-caliber soc-
cer teams have a great striker. Some
have a great midfielder. And some
have a great defender.

But all championship-caliber soc-
cer teams have a great goalkeeper.

And that’s exactly what Alex
Deegan was for the Wildcats in 1992.

Probably even more than star se-
nior striker Rob Ukrop — the most
prolific scorer in all of college soccer
that year, certainly the greatest soccer
player in Davidson history, and perhaps
the finest athlete, period, to have at-
tended this school — Deegan, a rather
undersized, 5-foot-9-inch, baby-faced
dynamo, and only a sophomore that
season, was the single most important
facet in the. Wildcats’ surreal march
through the national tournament brack-
ets.

Simply put, without Deegan’s he-
roics —particularly his almost unthink-
able penalty-kick-saving — Davidson's

- captivating postseason run never would
have gotten off the ground, let alone
soared to its ultimately miraculous
heights.

“Ukrop was the star of the regular
season,” coach Charlie Slagle said in an
interview this summer. “But Deegan
was the star.of the playoffs.”

In the first round against
Mecklenburg County rival UNC Char-
lotte, Deegan made two stops on five
49er penalty kicks, as the Wildcats ad-
vanced with a 4-3 edge in PKs.

Against a Coastal Carolina pen-
alty kick assault in the second round,
Deegan did the near impossible, stop-
ping five of the Chanticleers’ 10 at-
tempts — a virtually unheard of ratio
for a goalie in such situations.

Three of those shots — Nos. 5, 7,
and 9 — would have ended the Wild-
cats’ season had they gotten by Deegan.
No. 5 was a mind-boggling left-handed
stop on a ball earmarked for the corner
on Deegan’s right.

On the seventh, he guessed wrong
— diving left when the shot went right
—but deflected the Coastal blast with
an outstretched leg.

And the final game-saver was just

THE DAVIDSONIAN

pure anticipation, as Deegan confidently
smothered a low rocket at the post to his
left.

“T just couldn’ t believe we were in
that situation,” Deegan said in August
via telephone from Richmond, Va. “I
was struggling to keep myself in check
emotionally. My mindset was just.to
make the save to keep the team in the
game.

“Luck was on my side. Maybe I
made my own luck, but luck definitely
played a great part in that.”

But his teammates were not con-
vinced Deegan’s actions represented
nothing but dumb luck — or at least
now, five years later, that’s what they
claim.

For Matt Spear, the thought of
losing because of Deegan’s inability to
stop a penalty kick never crossed his
mind.

“There was something about it,”
Spear said this summer over breakfast
at the Soda Shop. “I think he sensed our
strength and we sensed his.”

“That was the best he (Deegan)
played all year,” Ukrop added in an
August interview in Richmond. “There
was this feeling that we were going to
win games.”

Said defensive stalwart Craig Omli
in a recent telephone interview from
Winston-Salem: “There was that confi-
dence that we were going to win some-
how.” :

And they did when Deegan pushed
the Chanticleer’s 10th and final attempt
up and over the crossbar.

Deegan’s reaction, other than re-
lief and sheer ecstasy: “I was amazed at

what had transpired in
the past 30 minutes.”

And although the
Wildcats’ _ national
quarterfinal matchup
with North Carolina St.
in Raleigh was not de-
cided by penalty kicks
— Ukrop’s goal in triple
overtime broke a score-
less tie and sent a deliri-
ous Davidson team and
fan corps back home for
the Final Four— Deegan
made eight saves in the
first overtime period.

“That first over-
time, they just took it to
us,” Slagle said.
“Deegan was once again
God-like. He made save *
after save, one of which *
he made with his foot.”

A Wolfpack striker
unleashed a so-called
knuckler — a shot that
has no spin and there-
fore travels in the air in
an abnormal and unpre-
dictable trajectory. It
fooled Deegan com-
pletely.

But similat to his
second game-saving ef-
fort versus Coastal, the
superstar keeper stuck
his leg out in despera-
tion and got a piece of |
the ball, redirecting it
over the net.

“That save,”

@ Star goalkeeper Alex Deegan is interviewed after stopping five
of ten penalty kicks in the Round of 16 against Coastal Carolina.

Deegan said, “when you

talk about lucky, that will go down as
the luckiest save of my life. That’s
when I said, ‘I think we’re probably
going to win this game.’”

In professional soccer circles,
Deegan’s penalty-kick-stopping prow-
ess is widely known. Since the fall of
1992, it has become his specialty.

“T watch their hips,” Deegan said
of his expert strategy.

“Their hips give you the first clue
as to where they’re going. So I guess
it’s an educated guess.”

“He just has instinct, and that is
what’s.so good about Alex,” Spear ex-
plained. “People say he’s short, but he
has such great instincts that he can make
up for that.

“T would rather have a keeper that
makes the big play. Not that Alex isn’t
solid, but he would make the extraordi-
nary play, as would Rob Ukrop.”

Deegan. graduated in December
1995 — by then, a living legend on
campus, a carry-over of sorts from a
bygone era of glory — and signed his
first professional contract with the
Wilmington Hammerheads.

He secured a starting position in
June and led the Hammerheads to a
berth in the Division III (American pro-
fessional soccer’s version of AA base-
ball) national semifinals.

Following his rookie season, he
moved up to the Richmond Kickers,
with whom he still plays — fittingly,
alongside Ukrop.

in Rtehmond — it is hard not to look
back on 1992.

Even though Deegan is clearly a
better goalie now than he was five years
ago — after all, he has been honing his
game ever since — the 1992 season,
and postseason, especially, will always
be his ultimate athletic experience.

“Alex has never had a season like
that since then,” Spear explained. “I
don’t think he ever will. And the thing
is, he’s getting better and better and
expanding his game as a professional.”

“It definitely doesn’t seem like
five years ago,” Deegan said. “It was
such.a memorable experience, it just
sort of lives there in your mind,

“T will never really forget it. You
just can’t.”

Nor would Deegan, or any other
member of the 1992 squad, want to.
