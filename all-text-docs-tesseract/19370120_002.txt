OPEN FORUM

There is a condition existing in
the school which is certainly not to
the benefit of the large number
concerned. Among a number which
feels in every respect the same way

I think it lamentable from the
standpoint of consideration for
others and deleterious in view of

the scholastic standing of the stu-

dents as a whole, that those in au-,

thority allow and promote by as-
signment the continuance of re-
views or monthly tests ‘and recita-
tions requiring much time on new
material right on through the day
preceding examinations.

Just because I have the privilege
of goading my team of oxen when
it is five minutes before quitting
time is no sign that I must. If I
have a few feet more of ground to
cover would it not be better to
leave the furrow straight but a
little short rather than to make it
crooked at the last minute? Why is
psychology taught in the schools—
because it is interesting? Of course,
there are exceptions and we thank
the professors who make it possible
to say that there are. “If the shoe
fits—etc.” Though there are oth-
who doubtless benefit from
they institutions pri-
marily for students. Could not the
exceptions hefe be made the rule?

The Editor:

Judging by the applause that
greeted the announcement that a
member of the student body be al-
lowed to play the organ it seems
to be the wish of a great majority.
The students seem to get in a more
religious mood when one of their
own number plays.

Here’s something that may or
may not be true, but that struck
us as an interesting bit of irony:

A certain recently married pro-
fessor has spent nine hard months
of preparation on papers which
were to be submitted for a coveted
degree, and had them in order for
presentation. Going to his desk to
secure them, this young doctor was
disturbed to find them missing, dis-
tracted to fintt that a too-zealous
servant had burned them for trash.
His subsequent remarks

We hope that’s just another case
of unfounded rumor.

In a country whose statute books
contain so many laws that even the
lawyers laugh about it, it’s unbeliev-
able that the most important anti-
social act of them all should have
been overlooked. All the petty
crimes like murder and burglary
are covered, yet this heinous of-
fense goes on right under all noses,
and we sit idly by and do nothing.
I refer, of course, to this. morbid
tendency on the part of so many of
our number to use their new elec-

Duke puts a man in the unlimited

This being the last Davidsonian
before exams are over, here are a
few inside tips straight from psy-
chology department on “How To
Make An A—In Ten Easy, Lessons.”
(1) On the morning of an exam,
sleep until about five minutes be-
fore the exam begins: you don’t, it
seems, forget while you sleep (of
course, you don’t learn either, but
why bring that up?) (2) Don’t eat
breakfast before an exam; a full
stomach, while pleasant, makes you
stupid. Personally, I’d rather flunk
than pass with hunger gnawing at
my vitals. I’m going to have to
flunk anyway—all my exams come
in the afternoon. And I’m darned
if I’ll sleep all morning and then
do without mys lunch. A Phi Beta
Kappa might do it , but not the
Kernel!
