Field Hockey
Ends Season

By ANDY BARRON

Davidson ended the 1984 field hoc-
key season with a 2—1 overtime win over
Wake Forest Wednesday. The victory
ended a year full of 1-0 losses and in-
numerable injuries on a high note. It.also
allowed seniors Kara Gilmore, Paige
Marsh, and Lou Hamilton to leave the
field for the final time as winners.

“It’s the culmination of everything
we worked for,” said Hamilton, who un-
fortunately had a short season due to a
knee injury. “This team has improved a
great deal over the year.”

Before beating Wake Forest, David-
son played in the Deep South Tourna-
ment. Davidson lost to both High Point
and Wake Forest |- 0 before beating the
Duke Club 1-0. :

“This team had to adapt so frequently
due to injuries,” said Coach Patty Daley.
“No matter how many people were hurt
or how bad things looked, the team never
let up. When we finally got some people
back into form, our tremendous im-
provement was allowed to show. We im-
proved all aspects of our game. It was a
good season.”

Though Davidson’s season is over,
three players from the team (as well as
Daley) were picked to play for the Deep
South team. Gilmore, Jannetta, and
sophomore Heather McKee will all com-
pete in the Southeast Tournament in
Washington, D.C. This team will play in
the national tournament in Long Beach,
California.

— From The Consessian Stand

Can Steve Get Anything Right?

By STEVE BYERS

So much for my predictions. Geo-
rgia Tech hasn’t played a good football
game in a month, and the Washington
Redskins have lost their last two. I’m
not about to venture a guess as to the
Southern Conference champion;
Western Carolina is the best team, but
apparently, that doesn’t mean any-
thing in the league. I’m surprised I
didn’t pick the Davidson All-Stars
over Wofford in flickerball.

Oh well, at least Doug Flutie still
looks solid for the Heisman. Knock on
wood.

What happened in the flickerball
game Saturday? Wofford was good,
but we shouldn’t have allowed SO
points. The Terriers played football
(i.e. throwing deep on almost every
play), but they got away with it. Their
cleats did give them an advantage, but
I don’t think we had our best players
out there. Davidson should have sent
the KA Gold up against them — a team
that has played together for a long time
makes a big difference.

Or maybe we lost for another
reason. Like All-Star center Jim
Brueggeman told me later Saturday
night, “We just weren’t hungry.” Any-
way, I think it only mght to acknowl-
edge the performance of senior Clint
Farabow, who was one of Davidson’s
few bright spots in the game.

It’s also time to recognize and
applaud two other Wildcat athletes.

The men’s tennis team id surprisingly
well in a tournament in Durham two
weeks ago. And senior Sedge Gray,
playing number one singles, was a big
reason. He beat the best players from
both North Carolina and Wake Forest.
Freshman Bill Young won his divi-
sion, knocking off his Carolina, Wake
Forest and N.C. State opponents. That
is quality competition, folks.

This past weekend, in Davidson’s
own Jim Causey Tournament, Gray
won the singles title, defeating the ten-
nis pro at Myers Park (Charlotte) in the
finals. If Gray can carry this momen-
tum into the regular season, the
Wildcats may be more than a spoiler in
the conference race.

While I’m handing out congratula-
tions, the soccer team won a big game
at Marshall Monday night. The 1-0
victory makes the game against Ap-
palachian State — here, Wednesday
afternoon — do or die for the Cats. The
winner will face Furman for the con-
ference championship, but there is a
catch. Davidson must win by at least
two goals to ensure itself a spot in the
title game; otherwise, a coin flip will
decide who goes. That’s Wednesday
afternoon. Be here, aloha.

Other sports goings-on: Rick
Sutcliffe and Willie Hernandez, this
season’s Cy Young winners, have both
filed for free agency, which means the
Cubs and the Tigers may be without

pitchers next year... . Sure,

Monday Night Football has had pre-
cious few good games this season, but
who cares? According to sophomore
Jim Kelly, “It is the best comedy show
currently on TV” so come laugh with
us or at us every Monday night in the
900 Room.

I’ve got a bone to pick with these
Friday afternon street hockey players.
This is the South. We don’t play hoc-
key down here — witness the Atlanta
Flames. You people are monopolizing
the outdoor basketball courts which in-
terrupts Gray House’s big games (usu-
ally combination of rugby, football
and the Keystone Cops). Come on, fel-
lows, while the weather is nice, show
some compassion. Isn’t hockey sup-
posed to be a winter sport anyway?

Believe it or not, pro basketball is
back. Pro basketball has what you
might call a rather lengthy season,
from mid-October to mid-June. If you
don’t consider yourself a fan of the
game, I encourage you to catch a few
games on cable sometime in the near
future. Arguably, this league boasts
the best athletes of all professional
sports. You have to work not to ap-
preciate the skills of players like Dr. J,
Magic, Michael J, James, Isiah,
Ralph, Larry Bird, etc.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK:

“He is the truth, the whole truth,
and believe me, nothing but the truth.”

teammate Michael Jordan
