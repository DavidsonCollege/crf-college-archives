Zamsky WillReturn
To Make Individual
Year-Book Photos

Many Students Express Desire to
Have Photographs Made
During This Visit

WILL COME IN FEBRUARY

Class Pictures to Be Sent to Pub-
lishers Soon

Jack. Williams, editor of the 1934
year book, has definitely announced
that the annual photographer will re-
turn to the campus in February to take
individual pictures of those students
who responded to his announcement
in chapel last week regarding the pos-
sibility of a return visit by the camera-
man.

The original plan was to have the
photographer make only one visit to
the campus, and at this time to take
all the: pictures that were to go into
the annual. Owing to the large num-
ber of boys who have come to mem-.
bers of the staff requesting the return
of the photographer, the editor has de-
cided to have one more day devoted to
individual pictures.

Williams stated that in a year book
it is most important to have individ-
ual pictures of all seniors. The ma-
jority of these pictures have been
taken, and others have signified their
intentions of making an appointment
in February, but the staff feels that

_it is necessary for at least a score more
to apply before it will be financially
worthwhile to take those pictures
which are held over until February. If
those who are given appointments will
keep them promptly, it will be a great
help to the, staff as well as the pho-
tographer,

oe Phe
ing the first semester has been more
or less in a formulative stage. Plans
were made last spring, and the work
so far has been the carrying out of
these ideas. The individual pictures are
to be sent to the engraver, and then
work is to begin on the features.

Letters have been sent out from the
business department to the various so-
cial. fraternities and honorary groups
upon the campus asking them to de-
cide about their page in the book.

It will be a great help in arranging
the financial side for all fraternities
and clubs who expect to be represent-
ed in the publication to pay one-half
-of their fee the first semester. This
will help to meet current obligations
and in turn aid the organizations by
making the payments in two inStall-
ments instead of-one sum in the spring.

The editor: wishes to request that
all orgaizations decide as soon as pos-
sible if they are to have a page or a
section.

is now one of the features of his pro-
gram.

Other of his broadcasts have taken
place from the renowned Pavillon
Royal on Long Island; the Steel Pier
in Atlantic City; the Mount Royal Ho-
tel, Montreal, and Norumbega Park,
Boston.

“Doc* NEW TON -Hean CoACH

William “Doc” Newton, head
coach of Davidson's football, whose
work here brought favorable com-
ments from a Birmingham writer.

Coach Doc Newton
Lauded by Paper

Birmingham Newspaper Writer
Calls Him a Rare Specimen

Panegyric words were dished out to
“Doc” Newton, head coach of the Da-
vidson football team, by Jerry Bryan,
Birmingham news writer, recently.
Newton used to coach football teams
in the southern metropolis before as-
suming duties here.

Part of the news story, which was
headed, “Here’s One Coach Who
Wasn't Fired, But He Got a Raise,” is
here reprinted:

“A specimen of genus homo as rare
in_ this unstable postasoaton football

iron coach whe fe no duals about
his job. So we give you a man marked
among men—William ‘Doc’ Newton,
head football coach at Davidson Col-
lege—he got a raise!

“Newton several years ago chunked
horsehide pellets for the Birmingham
Barons. He coached the freshman
teams at both Birmingham-Southern
and Howard and won victories with
the frosh on both sides of the city.

man numerals.

bers of the Freshman class would be
allowed fifteen minutes off the campus

Greek department, attended the sixty-
fifth annual meeting of the American
Philological Association, held there in

bers of their groups from all over the
United States, sometimes meeting
jointly and at other times conducting
their discussions in separate groups.

Both Dr. Harding and Professor
Bailey are members of the Philological
Association. This association is con-
cerned with the study of the science
of languages, and during the period of
the convention a great many interest-
ing and instructive papers were pre-
sented to the members on this sub-
ject. —

Aside from_.attending this conven-
tion in Washington, Dr. Harding also
spent a good deal of time while there
in examination of the types of archi-
tecture embodied in various important
buildings in Washington, and also Vis-
ited several art galleries in the Capital
City.

A special feature of the convention
was offered on Thursday evening,

Many Books ‘Added
To College Library

Recent Additions Represent Wide
Variety of Subjects

Many interesting modern books have
been added to the Davidson College
LLibrary...To those students who like
books concerning theology, “The
Christ of the Christian Faith” by Doc-
tor W. Douglas MacKenzie, and “The
March of Faith” by Winfred Ernest
Garrison would appeal. The changing
picture of the churches and of their
theology, the record of the men and
women who made them, and the sum-
mary of religious impact on our na-
tional life comprise this story of relig-
ion—this “March of Faith.”

“World Prosperity” by Wallace Mc-
Clure, “Tammany at Bay” by James
E. Finegan, “Humanity Uprooted and
Red Bread” by Maurice Hindus, and
“Gandhi versus the Empire” by Hari-
das T. Muzumdar are invaluable par-
alleled books for history students. Doc-
tor Muzumdar, in his book on Gandhi,
is a supporter of .the Gandhi principle
of non-violent revolution and is very
sympathetic in his writings on him.
The soul of India, of the deepest and
gentlest people known to history, is
found in this book on Gandhi.

“The Way of a Bee,” one of George
Rendl's books, is.a story of the ant’s
strange cycle of bee-life. “The Art
of Whistler,” by Elizabeth Robins Pen-
nell, is pleasing to those particularly
interested in painting. “My Friendly
Contempories,” by Hamlin Garland,
“The Facts of Fiction,” by Norman
Collins, “A Tale of Troy,” by John
Masefield, and “The Puppet Show,”
written by Follansbee, are some of the
new English books. The latter was
dedicated to the belief that there can
be peace-time as well as war-time pa-
triotism.

teresting data was revealed concern-
ing the monetary policies of various

ties, Captain Pritchett stated that ath-
letic competition between the classes
of colleges and universities in the
United States had shown an average
