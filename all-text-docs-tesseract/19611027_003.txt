BMIC

MUCH TO THE disappointment of many Davidson
fans, this year’s BMIC award no longer belongs to oni
own Bill Shumaker. °

For the unenlightened, BMIC stands<for “Biggest |
Man In Conference.” For several years, Shumaker, a
245-lb. senior tackle, has been the distinguished holder |
of this title. His closest competitors last year included
Mike Zeno, 240-lb. guard for VPI; Bill Sizemore, 239-lb.
tackle for West Virginia; John Candler, 238-lb. tackle for |
VMI; and Joe Monti, 240-lb. tackle at Furman.

But, alas! What do they feed these young boys now? |

CITY STADIUM IS SCENE OF 2 P. M. BATTLE

Dole Installs New
Strategy For Spiders

BY BILL PRIDGEN
Davidsonian Sports Writer
Coach Bill Dole’s Wildcats meet the University of
Richmond tomorrow at 2 p.m. in Richmond, Virginia's
City Stadium.

The 'Cats will be attempting
to avenge a 35-6 Homecoming
loss at Davidson to the Spiders
last year. The Davidson-Rich-
mond series currently favors the
Spiders, 9-7-1.

CHANGES

Dole and his staff have plan-
ned some definite changes for
tomorrow's game. The game will

we play. Mel Rideout, their
quarterback, is one of the best
in the conference.”

Last season, Rideout complet-
ed 85 passes for 904 yards—15th
best in the nation. In this sea-
son's opening game he picked
up where he had left off by
throwing three touchdown, pass-
es and running another over as
the Spiders swamped West Vir-

The new influx of players from last year’s freshman | mark the first time in two years

fourth in the conference—aimost in the dwarf category!

This year’s BMIC award goes to Richmond's sopho-
more tackle, Buddy Waite, who at 265 seems pretty well
assured of a three year reign. Following Waite are George
Hinds, 257-lb. sophomore tackle at Furman, Bunky
Brooks, 247-lb. sophomore tackle from West Virginia,
and, alas, our Shumaker.

A-C, AN EASY CHAIR, AND A FLICK

FOR THE BENEFIT of those who are already looking
forward to the basketball season, we dropped into Lefty
Driesell’s air-conditioned (A-C) office the other day to
find out the good word.

He and his assistant, Joe Hunt, were busy watching
some films of one of this year’s opponents, so we dropped
down in an easy chair to watch a thrilling game. (Our
future opponent won the game by one point.)

“I believe that’s a 2-3 they’re running, Joe,” Lefty
stated as he jotted down a few notes. “Man, they're let-
ting that guy have that corner shot. Joe, I swear we can
a these guys. Look how they loaf back down
court.”

And so on went the comments. We got the feeling
that this man, who lives basketball 24 hours a day, is
going to surprise some more people again this season.
Where or when we don’t know. But either the Wake For-
est or Duke game would be good for a starter, while the
Southern Conference Tournament at Richmond in March
would be good for a nightcap.

So far Driesell has just been trying to round his boys
into shape. His main concern right now is the game with
the freshmen on Monday night, November 27, in the
gym. Admission will be charged, with all proceeds going
to the Living Endowment Fund.

THE CRYSTAL BALL

Another disastrous weekend last week (2-4) put our
record at 22-13, but we peeped again into our crystal
ball and saw the following:

Richmond has played a lot better ball than their 2-4
record indicates. Their tremendous recruiting program
a couple of years ago has given them more personnel
with the potential to be the most explosive in the con-
ference. Foreseeing another possible VPI, we’ll have to
stick with Richmond’s manpower though. Pick Richmond,
21-14.

Xavier (Ohio) over The Citadel, 14-7; Furman over
Wofford, 21-13; George Washington over Boston U., 15-6;
VMI over William & Mary, 13-46; Florida State over VPI,
12-0; and Army over West Virginia, 26-13.

UNC Dumps Booters;
Gamecocks Here Today

BY JOHNNY SPRATT
Davidsonian Sports Writer

With a touch of flashing speed, the North Carolina
soccer team pushed over two goals in the second half to
deal Davidson’s scrappy Wildcats their first loss here on

Tuesday.

Coach Harry Fogelman, ed well and tried hard.”
though not exultant over the JUST MISSED
loss, was nevertheless well In fact, under closer analysis,

the victory was rather fragile.
Twice in the first quarter and
once in the third, ‘Cat boots just
|missed the Tarheels’ nets. In
| addition, both UNC goals came
'on breaks and not set up plays.

“They were just too fast,”
said Fogelman. “Our wingbacks
and halfbacks had to drop back
' |for defense and we consequent-
lly couldn’t get our offense
| started.”

The Carolina coach had high
praise for Wildcat goalie Jamie
McCutchen following the game.
® | MeCutchen made several beau-

| tiful saves that prompted the}

| visiting mentor to compare him
with last year’s All-American
Claude Finney.

Also outstariding for Davidson

were forward Allen Jonés,

pleased with his team’s play.
“We played a good game,”
said Fogelman. “Everyone play-

back Frank Tulloch, and: half-
back Gary Lane.
TEMPERS FLARE
Tempers flared several times
during the heat of battle much
to the delight of the estimated

Richardson scholar from Eng-|
land, forward Fred Schoen, half- |’

j}under a two platoon system.
|Dole will be substituting two
j units, but each will stay in on
| offense and defense.

| “There will be no offensive
{or defensive units as such,” re-
marked the Dole. The reason
|for the change is obviously to
| boost the ‘Cats’ sagging offen-
| sive play of the past few games.
| Following last week's 13-0 loss

| to VMI, Davidson carries a 2-3

record to Richmond. The Spid-
ers are 2-4, and have been hot
and cold all season. They have
beaten West Virginia (35-28)
and George Washington (16-15).
Losses have been to Army (7-24),
VMI (6-8), The Citadel (6-24),
and Florida State (7-13).
MORE OFFENSE
The Spiders sport a multiple
offense, which is potentially as
good as any in the conference.
Comments Dole, “They have
more offense than anyone else

12-6 victories over the Kappa

Sparked by Andy Sherrill, Nat
Harris, and John Harris, the
Delts clipped the Sigs on Mon-
day, when Sherrill threw a last
second, deciding TD pass to
John Harris. Trailing 6-0 with
a couple of minutes left, the
Kappa Sigs began a last ditch
drive. All-Star tailback Johnny

off, and a few plays later the
Delts scored the winning TD.

On Wednesday, the regylation
SAE-Phi Delt game ended in a
66 tie. In the overtime (during
which each team gets 4 plays to
score or gain the most yardage),
the Delts scored on a 4th down
play as Nat Harris hit Sherrill,
who flipped to Hill Wellford,
who flipped to John Harris, who
outran the SAE secondary for
the score. The SAE’s, sparked
by Mac Smythe, J. D. Simpson,
and Tommy Tuttle, stormed
right back to the Delts’ 9 in two
plays. But two straight incom-
plete passes ended SAE hopes.

Other scores this week: Mon-
