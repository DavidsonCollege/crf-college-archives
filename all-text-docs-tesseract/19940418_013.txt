Women's tennis finishes 2nd in Southern Conférence

By Tracy French

The Davidson women’s ten-
nis team headed into the Southern
Conference Championships with a
strong 6-1 conference record, fin-
ishing second in the Southern con-
ference regular season behind
Furman.

Coach Caroline Price said ear-
lier in the season that Davidson
looked to challenge the Paladins in
the Southern Conference Champi-
onship. “Although in our head-to-
head competition Furman won 8-
__ 1, we felt we were competitive at
six of the nine positions. So we
feel with a few adjustments we can
position ourselves for arun at them
at the Southern Conference cham-

pionships.” ’
The Davidson women were

- seeded strongly in each flight.

Cyndi Hess was seeded 4 in flight
1, and Kimberly Nance, Nicole
Wilcox, Jennifer Beahm, Natasha
Ruth, and Susannah Cobb were
seeded 2 in their respective flights.
In the doubles, our number 1
doubles team of Tasha Ruth and
Barbara Grooms was seeded 4, our
number 2 doubles team of Cyndi
Hess and Kimberly Nance was
seeded 1, andournumber3 doubles
team of Nicole Wilcox and
Susannah Cobb'was seeded 2. ©

Going into Sunday, after two
rounds of singles, Davidson was
tied with Furman. Due to some

upsets, both Furman and Davidson
were going to play for third place
in both the number 1 and 2 flights.
In flights 3, 4, 5, and 6, Nicole
Wilcox, Jennifer Beahm, Natasha
Ruth, and Susannah Cobb all ad-
vanced to the finals.

InSunday’s finals, Cyndi Hess
(4) played a solid match to defeat
Katherine Price (2) of Furman 6-1,
1-6, 6-2 for third place.. “I wasn’t
expected to beat her, so I was ex-
cited,” said Hess. Kimberly Nance
lost a tough match, however, to
Erin Powell (1) of Furman. Nicole
Wilcox, who plays third for
Davidson, was defeated by Amy
Ditty of Furman 6-2, 6-1. Number
6, Susannah Cobb, also lost a rough

match to Tara Hardin of Furman 7-
5 in the third, but Tasha Ruth hand-
ily defeated her opponent 6-2, 6-3.

The biggest upset of the day
came when Jennifer Beahm (2)
defeated senior Sadie Ellen

Maynard (1) of Furman 6-3, 4-6,

6-1. Beahm handed Maynard her
first conference loss ever.

“It was a great, great match.
She won 6-1, 7-6 during the regu-
lar season, and since that match
I’ve been working on my game

hoping to beat her,” said Beahm. ©

The taste of victory was especially
sweet for Beahm since this is her
last year at Davidson.

In the doubles competition,
the number 2 Furman doubles team

beat Cyndi Hess and Kimberly
Nance 6-2, 3-6, 6-4. Tasha Ruth
and Barbara Grooms finished fifth
in the number 1 bracket.

Coach Price seemed very
happy. “All of them played tough
matches, mentally tough and solid
matches. It’s the team working
together, supporting each other,
and working their skills. It’s being
consistent and staying intense and
staying focused and staying posi- —
tive. It’s problem solving on the
court when you need to and mak-
ing adjustments. All those types of
decisions are being made and be-
ing made consistently well by
Davidson.”

What is happening to the National Football League?

Can somebody please explain
what is going on in the. National

Why are long-time veterans of one

Men’s tennis streak
ends at 9 VS. Furman

By Will Cobb

The men’s tennis team lost to
Furman yesterday 5-2 in a match
that determined the regular season
champion of the Southern Confer-
ence. The Wildcats finished the
season with a 15-6 record and now
will compete for the conference
title here this weekend.

The team started the match
strong by sweeping Furman for the
doubles point. Russell Briggs and
Ryan Harper won 9-8, Holt
Vaughan and Dan Parham won 8-
5, and Chris Parker and Bill
Mitchem won 8-5.

This was the first time all year
Furman suffered a sweep in
doubles. Unfortunately, Davidson

would not enjoy the same success
in singles, as Russell Briggs was
the only player to earn a victory
with a 6-3, 2-6, 6-2 victory that
will guarantee Briggs the #1 seed
this weekend in singles and
doubles. —

Junior Dan Grinnan ended up
ina three-way tie for the first seed,

‘and all other players like Vaughan,

Parker, Perham, and Harper ex-
pect to be-seeded between the sec-
ond and fourth seeded positions.
The Wildcats have positioned
themselves well enough to make a
serious attempt to win this week-
end. Competition for the Southern
Conference Championships will
begin here on Friday.

agency. With the new collective
bargaining agreement, players now
can jump all around the league.
This year, the second with unre-
stricted free agency and the first
with a salary cap, teams are no
longer able to pay every member
what he wants. Thus, they aban-
don ship and sign on with the high-
est bidder.

Now, fundamentally, this
should not be a problem. After all,
what is more American than get-
ting paid as much as youcan? But
there isa problem to all of this. The
NFL is changing into something
nearly unrecognizable. If this dis-
turbing trend continues, a fan will

.do little more in the off-season

than keep track of which players
went where.

This whole situation came es-
pecially to light this past week
when in one astonishing day three
top-rated, or formerly top-rated,
quarterbacks either switched teams

.or were cut primarily because of

money. The Houston Oilers traded
Warren Moon to. Minnesota be-
cause they didn’t want to pick up
the 37-year-old’s $3.25 million
contract anymore. The Washing-

ton Redskins released ex-Super
Bowl MVP Mark Rypien due to
his $3 million deal that they just
couldn’t afford to support under
the new cap.

Some people will argue that
Bernie Kosar’s jump from the
world champion Dallas Cowboys
to Miami was not money-based. In
Dallas, he was the backup to Troy
Aikman. In Miami, he will be
number two behind Dan Marino.
That’s hardly improving your situ-
ation. Marino did miss nearly all
of last season to injury, but he is
expected to return this year at full
strength, and he has shown atypi-
cal resilience for an NFL passer.
Aikman, however, has missed at
least a couple games each year to
injury. If Kosar simply wanted to
play, he could have done it on a
better team, but Miami simply
offered him more money.

Maybe Kosar wanted to re-
turn to the site of his glorious col-
lege days, but he leaves behind a
very good shot at another Super
Bowl ring, as have a number of
other Cowboys. Consider Dallas’

Golf

finishes

year 9th
at So.
Con.

By Neil Marks

The golf team ended its sea-
son with a ninth place finish at the
Southern Conference Tournament
at the Council Fire Country Club
in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on
Monday and Tuesday.

Playing under difficult windy
conditions the team was in eighth
place after an opening round of
322 and had hopes of moving up,
but a disappointing second round
of 342 was too tough to overcome.

The team played an inspired
final round, shooting an impres-
sive 315 as a group, but it wasn’t
enough to get them out of ninth
place.

Sophomore Sean Mercer was
the team’s most consistent player,
shooting an 80 on Monday and 79-
78 0n Tuesday. Senior captain Will
McDaniel shot a 90 in his first
round on Tuesday but came back
strong with a three-over-par 75 in
the final round. He was one under
over the last nine holes.

. The rest of the tournament
team included junior Kevin Miller,
junior Hal Fogleman and sopho-
more Bob Bailey.

With Will McDaniel as. the
only graduating senior in the top
five and a couple of promising
freshmen joining the team next
year, coach Joe Mark likes the
team’s chances next season.

“Next year looks good. We’ve
shown lots of improvement over
the fall and through the spring as
well. All of the returning players
will have valuable tournament ex-
perience and I’m sure they will
improve a great deal over the sum-
mer as well,” said coach Mark.
