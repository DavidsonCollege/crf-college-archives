Promiscuity demands responsibility

By PATRICIA McMURRAY
Staff Writer

Mecklenburg County is the ‘‘clap”

capital of southeastern United States; .

pregnancy is the single leading cause
for young women dropping out of
high school in North Carolina; the
birthrate in North Carolina has
dropped in all age groups except
among teenagers.

The increase of pregnancy fre-
quency has been most noticable
between the ages of eleven and
fifteen; approximately twenty percent

‘of all pregnancies are planned.

These are only a few of the facts
Laurena Page,'a representative of
Planned Parenthood of Charlotte,
mentioned in an hour and half
presentation this last Tuesday.

The truth is that unplanned parent-
heod and the effects of today’s
‘Looser morality’’ can be tragic.

The organization feels that people

must learn about their bodies and how -

to control their fertility so as to avoid
the misfortunes of sexual ignorance.
Planned Parenthood works to solve
some of these problems.

The Planned Parenthood of greater
Charlotte has a mission. It hopes to
‘‘enhance the quality of life in
Charlotte and elsewhere by helping
people manage their fertility.”’

Page commented that “the organi-

zation has approached this mission
through three different program
areas: educational, medical and coun-
seling.”” Tours, lectures, advertise-
ments, brochures, television shows,
etc., are all a part of thé’educational
program, where the how’s and why’s
of planning families are discussed.

The medical services offered by
Planned Parenthood include the
issuing of contraceptives, pregnancy
diagnosis and testing, venereal di-
sease testing, first trimester abor-
tions, Pap smears, and vasectomies.

The counseling services include
group visits, individual sessions and
telephone counseling. This program
provides information concerning con-
traceptives, abortions and other areas
of human sexuality. It is Planned
Parenthood’s belief that it should
provide an opportunity for a person to
understand his sexuality through
information on birth control, family
planning guidance and high quality
medical service.

The. lecture discussion session in
Perkins Auditorium on Tuesday was
a part of the community education
program that works within schools,
public housing developments,
churches and clubs as well as colleges.
Page traced the history of the organi-
zation, described its medical services
and discussed several contraceptive
methods in detail.

Since the average female client of
Planned Parenthood usually has
néver been to a. gynecologist before,
the lecture also included an explicit
description of a pelvic examination:
‘It’s one of those necessary evils that
a woman shouldn’t fear. Once you
understand the procedure it will
minimize the trauma that is often
associated with a ‘visit to the gyneco-
logist.’ ”’

Originally Planned Parenthood of
greater Charlotte was a telephone
clinic that merely provided contracep-
tive and abortion information. In
1972 the organization expanded to
include a small clinic for pregnancy
diagnosis and problem pregnancy
counseling, with an average of six to
eight clients a week. Now there are
four to five thousand telephone calls
and over 1500 patients per month that
use the outgoing patient clinic for

prescribing low cost birth control
preventatives, pelvic examinations,
pregnancy tests, vasectomies and
abortions.

The clinic does not handle such
sterilization procedures as tubal liga-
tions since the anaesthesia lends itself
to complications that a hospital is
better equipped to control. The
organization has done everything
possible to make the less complicated
medical and counseling services avail-
able to everyone.

Human sexuality is Planned
Parenthood’s business. It is a volun-
tary, non-profit agency supported
primarily by contributions from the
community. And, aside from its
intrinsic merit, the organization has
accomplished some great things in
terms of making people become more
aware of the responsibility of ‘‘sexual
literacy.”’
