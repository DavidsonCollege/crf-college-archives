The Great Davidson Fashion Debate

Hardly a
minor issue

Liberal arts. What’s in a name?

By coming to a school like Davidson, we sacrifice diversity. Should we attend a
larger university, most of us would be able to take classes such as “Business in the
Cyberworld,” or “An analytical approach to Madonna’s videos.”

We came here knowing that. We also came here knowing that we would have core
requirements to fill and a hefty major requirement. We came here knowing that we
would have to work hard (4 hours.a night average, right?) and that a balance between
academics and, well, anything else would be a struggle to maintain.

So, the faculty have voted, we should not have minors. A minor would only give
each student a more limited exposure to elective classes in many different departments.
A minor would only add pressure to an already intense course load and life.

Maybeso. But the truth stands: we are going to take what we want to, with or without
the option of a minor.

We are students first because we.want to be, not for transcript credit. The courses
we take here are principally for us, and whether or not we receive additional titles or
honors for our work, we will take them. The number of students who (officially or no)
audit classes serves as testament to this.

Offering minors would only be giving a name to the limits and pressure we already
place on ourselves.

The Careers Office tells us that a minor would look good on our resumes. Countless
students travel abroad and receive no real credit for it; most abroad programs will only
accept those who have completed basic requirements, and not everyone wants to major
in a language. Minors would give students credit for what they are already doing.

Most importantly, those who are really dedicated to two different fields are now

- double majoring. Electives and pressure, then, are obviously not real issues. Double
majors don’t sample electives, for they have to taketen more classes instead of just five. '

So, we ask, why no minors? It seems silly.

Talk to professors about it. Some faculty say that they have not received much
student input on the issue, that they are not sure that students really want minors. Is that
really why? Are the petitions and SGA resolutions not enough? Then what are they
waiting for?

Here it is: we want minors.

Vogelbacher responds

To the editors:

Eric Sapp. was right.

Ihave never felt the heat
from a star far away, never
seen acarbon atom up close,
or ever sailed around the
world. I’ve never even been
to Chicago.

But if someone were to
ask me whether I believed
that Michael Jordan was re-
ally playing 600 miles away
while watching the game on
TV I would reply, “Yes.”
Yet I would be hesitant to
claim that this belief is faith.

It would be difficult to
prove that MJ is actually in
Chicago from my palatial,
imitation dorm room in Ist
West Belk. I probably
couldn’t even prove that
Chainbers was smack in the
middle of campus from my
room. But I digress ...

As an aspiring intellec-
tual, I don’t blindly acquire
information from books, pro-
fessors, or pastors. The fact
that Icandiscriminate, ques-
tion, and choose enables me

to accept some explanations
and reject others. “A choice
in God is our decision,” as
Eric suggests, “and we will
make it for our own rea-
sons.” Personal justifica-
tions and first-person ac-
counts of people “‘discover-
ing” God doesn’t give le-
gitimacy to this belief.
Surely the bigot has his
own reasons for being rac-
ist. Many have seen and
heard personal narratives re-
counting UFO abductions,
out of body-travel, and
sightings of Elvis at Harris-
Teeter. Just because thou-
sands of people believe’ in

and ‘can “understand” the.

Bible as opposed to the
theory of relativity doesn’t
provide validity to either
claim. Many people used to
think the sun revolved
around the earth.

I never once declared
that a rational person
couldn’ tacceptthe existence
of God. Nor did Iassert the
non-existence of God.

In .

my article, I just tried to show
that life could have “mean-
ing” without belief in a
Higher Being. I merely as-
sume this position by de-
fault, as sort of a null-hy-
pothesis. In no way do I
think that there is no evi-
dence for a belief in God, I
simply feel that this evidence
is confounded and inconclu-
Sive.

I have never stuck my
head inside the nuclear reac-
tor at McGuire power plant.
But I'll believe the techni-
cian who tells me that ura-
nium atoms are being split —

that’ matter is being con-
time I switch on my lights,
my support for Einstein’s

‘hypothesis grows a tiny bit

stronger. I am still looking
for that convincing evidence
with God. Maybe some day
I will find it.

Sincerely,
Rob Vogelbacher, ‘97

Talk

about minors

To the Editors:

Last Tuesday, February
13, the SGA passed without
Opposition a resolution in
favor of the current proposal
by the Council on Academic
Affairs (CAA) for academic
minors at Davidson.

As many students and .

faculty may know, this is not
the first time that the SGA
has discussed the issue of
minors; in fact the Academic
Affairs Council has spent the
last year working on this is-
sue.

During the course of last
year, three proposals (includ-
ing this one) have been writ-
ten, hours of research con-
ducted, and numerous meet-
ings held with the Educa-
tional Policy Committee
(EPC). Indeed, tireless ef-
forts have been put forth by
several students and faculty,
all for the sake of bringing to
Davidson yet another aca-
demic benefit.

The resolution, there-
fore, is not a new attempt to
bring this issue to the fore-
front.

Rather, it joins a peti-
tion signed by over 50% of
the student body and two
surveys conducted by the
CAA as a solid reminder of
the demand by students to
have minors at Davidson.

Furthermore, the reso-
lution symbolizes the sup-
port that SGA members give
tothe current proposal, a pro-
posal written after much
compromise and tremendous
amounts of research.

There are reasons why
we support this proposal. It
recommends that “minors
will remain optional for de-
partments to offer” and that
“departments may exercise
their own discretion con-
cerning declaration of mi-
nors and advisors for mi-
nors,”

- Also it states that indi-

vidual departments will
choose courses which con-
stitute minors, that students
must maintain a minimum
GPA of 2.0 to pursue a mi-
nor, and that students may
not pursue two minors ora .
minor and a double major.
We reiterate that the
SGA finds no flaws in this
proposal which should keep
it from becoming college
policy. Furthermore, .we
findnoreason why Davidson
should fail to offer minors.
While we are encour-
aged by the overall student
support and by the passage
of this resolution, we realize

that bringing minors to

Davidson requires even
more action.

On behalf of the SGA,
we ask students who sup-
