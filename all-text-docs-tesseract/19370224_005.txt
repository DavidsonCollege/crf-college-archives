MEMBERS OF ‘D’ CLUB
PLAN TO ABOLISH ALL
INFORMAL INITIATIONS
IN RECENT MEETINGS

Traditional Comical Initiation
Will Be Replaced By
Formal

PLANNING ATHLETIC DAY

Proposal Made For Promotion
Of Minor Sports

The “D” Club held its regu-
lar meeting on Tuesday night,
Feb. 16, in the “D” Club room.

The outstanding feature of the
meeting was the decision to abolish
all “horseplay” at initiations: The
traditional comical initiation will be
replaced by a strictly formal pro-
gram of initiation at chapel, more
on the order of O. D. K. tap day
programs. From now on, there will
be no more skirts, no more molasses
slinging, and no more fashion pa-
rades. Freshmen will be permitted
to safely leave their rooms on oc-
casions of “D” Club initiations in
the future. The day of torture has
been ruled out.

In addition to this step, a pro-
posal was made for the promotion
of minor sports at Davidson, includ-
ing the establishment of B teams
in the minor sports. Efforts will
be made to extend coaching facili-
ties in these sports. Managers and
captains of the specific teams are to
more or less collaborate in an ef-
fort to bring more stress to bear
on their particular sports.

Further discussion followed, con-

cerning “D” Club activities, in an
effort to extend the influences and
actions to a broader field during
the coming year.

The organization is making plans
for the coming Athletic Day pro-
gram in chapel, at which time
medals and awards will be made
to students for merit in athletics
at Davidson.

CHEMUREGCOUNGL
WL HAVE MEETING

To Plan Advancement of In-
dustry -In South

Mr. Carl B. Fritsche, managing
director of the Farm Chemurgic
Council, visited here last week to
announce to members of the faculty
a conference to be held in Macon,
Ga., on April 9th and 10th. Mr.
Fritsche talked to a group of the
faculty and was invited by
Prof. J. P. Williams.

This conference, said Mr. Fritsche
is to take up industrial problems
and to look forward to the ad-
vancement of industry in the twelve
southern states. He showed the
four most important and interesting
methods of advancement of indus-
trial progress in the south.

Mr. Fritsche gave as the four
coming industries of the south:
First, the growth of the tung tree.
One hundred million acres of these
will be planted in southern states
and will yield about $60 an acre
after six years.

Second, he said that the slash pine
paper industry, as ¢stablished by
Dr. Herty, of Savannah, Ga., would
help the farmers of the south, Forty
three million dollars will be spent on
these, and they will yield the south-
farmer approximately $40 an

LaRoque Journey to Ashe-

Jan Garber seems to have
made quite an impression on
the Davidson students at the
Mid-Winters dances. In fact,
four of the Davidsonians were
so impressed that they follow-

last Monday. These four boys
were Bill McLean, Bob Nich-
ols, Ben Nash, and Dick La-
Roque. ;

Part of the fun of the little trip
was due to the spontaneity of the
idea. It was already past 7 P. M.

The home was one of the original

Elm Row, Oak Row, Stewart Hall
and the old Chapel, better known

as Shearer Biblical Hall. These
buildings and their arrangement
was planned by Dr, Robert Hall
Morrison, first president of Dav-

Dr. Morrison was the first oc-

Dr. W. J. Martin, the precessor
