October air brings baseball fever

Athletes become heroes
again in postseason

It gota little chilly this week. Perfect fiming. -

As division races come toaclose
and the baseball playoffs begin,
the air of mystery that swirls in
with that first crisp hint of autumn
brings with it the first feelings of
the impending excitement on the
orange and yellow horizon.

Who could help but reminisce.

The aura of anticipation that
surrounds the Fall Classic, like
most things, seems proportionately
larger the farther we travel back in
time to remember it.

No matter how big we get or old
we grow, the magnitude and
history of the event are enough to
make anyone feel small again.

It allows us to bend down and look through
the wide eyes of that awestruck little kid and
see the Series for what it was then, and, in this
sense, still is.

Athletes become heroes again, larger than
life because of the home runs they hit and the
uniforms they wear, not. the steroids they
inject or the dietary supplements they ingest.

The cork they use fills only the champagne

In high school football, acts of both heroics

and hazing can turn up frequently . .. As for
heroics, a Bishop-Hoban senior, Gerry
McGroarty, kicked a 64-yard field goal on
Saturday. This record not only crushes any
high school record, but it beats the current
- NFL record. Jason

». Elam was the last player
| to kick a 63-yard field
| goal inthe NFL... And
| for hazing, at Luke-
| Lehman High, ‘a junior
varsity quarterback was
E tied to a chair and plas-
| tered with pain-relieving
| ointment on his face.
| After a practice on
| Wednesday, four line-
men in the team felt the
need to harass this QB
for his interception-
throwing performance in the previous game.
The chair ended up slipping and Adam Har-
ris fell to the ground and cut his head. He
commented afterwards, “They told me this is
what happens when you throw interceptions”
. The Detroit Tigers did everything they
needed to do to finish out their season the way
they wanted. They won five of their last six
games, their best six game stretch of the sea-
son, and avoided making history. With two
more losses the Tigers would have held the
MLB record for losses in a season. The 1964

bottles that await the winning team in the
locker room. Broken bats warrant attention
only if they happen to head in your direction.

Spit has only two destinations: the mouth
or.the ground.

Batters run out every fly ball because they
want to win, and pitchers throw inside to
inflate the strike zone, not their egos.

The players on your team are your guys and
always have been, whether they’ ve been with
the organization for a decade or a year.

Memories of past teams, trades, and signings
disappear the moment he gets that first

postseason hit or strikeout for the home team.

Mets currently hold the record with 120. The
Tigers finished with 119 losses and a good
taste in their mouths as they break for the
winter . . . The Yankees, having already
clinched their home-field advantage playoff
spot, decided to have some fun on Sunday. As

And the ugly ideas of labor disputes and
strike dates disappear with them.

These heroes receive their pay from the
affection of fans and the acclaim of their
teammates, not to mention the thrill of
postseason play.

Complicated complaints of
ludicrous contracts and
skyrocketing payrolls fade away
into, the world of adult concerns,
where they belong, along with talk
of television deals and sports
sponsorships.

Network Associates Coliseum
and Pacific Bell Park are simply
Oakland and San Francisco
Stadium. Yankee Stadium--hey, it’s
always been Yankee Stadium, and
that will never change.

And through this child you can
once again walk into one of these
stadiums and feel dwarfed by the
size of the field and sound of the crowd,
instead of crushed by corporate control.

Suddenly, the six-dollar hot dog in your
hand becomes a simple ballpark frank again,
as if your father had silently paid for it while

you were staring intently a ction on the
field.

Take a bite and enjoy.
This is what makes it classic.

with homecoming more than football. The two teams are
playing each other for the first time, and the “Cats are

a state judge that his one-year suspension is
being upheld. He had requested that this
suspension be cancelled, but the request was
dismissed by Judge Rosemary Cedet. Back in
January he was suspended for “not doing his
best” at the Delta Downs with his horse, Clean-
ing House. During the race, the horse stumbled
twice, acquired a hoof injury that was discov-

be the second game if the series, the Braves, winners of the NL East

are giving the nod to Mark Prior.
