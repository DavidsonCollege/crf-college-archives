Who's Who publishes names of 43 Davidson senior leaders

By Sarah Teachworth

Here at Davidson students can
easily get the feeling that his or her
life is nothing but an endless quest
for a higher GPA. So it’s a wel-
come change of pace when stu-
dents are recognized for their other
achievements. Forty-three extraor-
dinary seniors were recently se-
lected to be profiled in Who’s Who
among American Colleges and
Universities. a

Each year, Who’s Who allots

a certain number of students they
can choose to be represented in
their publication over 1800 institu-
tions. It is then the responsibility
of the school to seek out those

students most qualified for the
honor. At Davidson, the Dean of
Students office undertakes this
task.
Recommendations are taken
from faculty, heads of student or-
ganizations, resident advisors, and
others. The final decision is based
on factors such as students’ leader-
ship abilities, community service
efforts, academic achievement, and
potential for future leadership roles.
The Dean of Students couldn’t
have been happier with the list his
office produced. Dean Shandley
says, “It tends to show that this
represents a diverse group of stu-
dents that are considered outstand-

ing.”

Cat Grimmel says that “It
makes me feel really good about

the school that there are so many _ therecould be forty-three seniors

people active enough that represented in Who's Who.”

Cornwell creates second
writing scholarship

By Randy Hartwell

Few interviews have probably
gone as well as sophomore Sean
McGrew’ s did with crime novelist
and 1979 Davidson graduate
Patricia Cornwell. The best-sell-
ing author decided to create an
unprecedented award for
McGrew’s writing after her 1993

meeting with him as part of the .

final selection process of the then
newly established Cornwell Prize
for Excellence in Writing.

The Scarpetta Prize, as the
award is called, was named for
Cornwell’s imaginary principal
character, Dr. Kay Scarpetta. It

honors McGrew’s ability to syn-’

thesize skillful, writing ,with a
knowledge of science and technol-

ogy, a quality that makes Cornwell |
a much celebrated author.

McGrew says of Cornwell,
‘What she liked about my writing
was my conviction that [the ability
to] write skillfully and clearly is a
necessary tool no matter what field
you’re in, whether you’ re a biolo-
gist or a politician.”

Cornwell intends to offer the
prize, which carries an annually
renewable award of $10,000, ev-
ery year. Dr. Anthony Abbott,
English professor and chair of the
English department, says, “This
prize, especially in combination
with the Cornwell, will bring to

Davidson a group of young writers
whose presence will affect the
whole campus.”

Freshmen self-select eating houses and fraternities

issue of policy, it’s an issue of
care.”

One widespread rumor was
that Shandley’s office would treat
pledges’ streaking as a Code of
Responsibility violation. This was
not true. Shandley said, “We
haven’t said anything about that.
That has not come from this of-
fice.”

Shandley stressed personal
responsibility in regard to Self-
Selection night. He says a signifi-
cant problem had been that “people
are not held accountable for their
actions” which helped to perpetu-
ate reckless behavior. He also said,
“If bad things happen, people can’t
continue to duck their heads in the

sand.”

Shandley is sympathetic tothe
pressures of pledging, especially
hazing. He offers this definition of
hazing: “The difference is if you
choose to do that (a pledging activ-
ity) or are forced to do that. If you
are forced to do that, that’s haz-
ing.” He also says, “If a student
finds [a pledge activity] offensive,
he has every right to bring a Code
of Responsibility charge.”

Holmes believes the cause of
many of the rumors may lie in a
letter written by Holmes and dis-
tributed to freshmen men and
women on their return this semes-
ter. Holmes’s letter contained a
general outline of permissible
pledge and new member activities
on one side, and Davidson’ s defi-

Double majors approved

Major continued from page |

Some Davidson students had
likewise expressed an interest in
the option of double majoring. Says
Registrar Polly Griffin, “It seems
to be more of a desirable option for
those students who either know
exactly what they want to do or for
those who came to Davidson with
many Advanced Placement cred-
its.”

The EPC recommendation
met some debate when it was
brought before the faculty at the
beginning of December. Dean of
Faculty Robert Williams says,
“There are some faculty members
who have a fear of excessive spe-

cialization and who really want to
protect breadth by core require-
ments.” ie

Despite objections, the rec-
ommendation passed with the con-
sensus of the faculty. Griffin says,
“There are very few students who
actually want to follow through
with the requirements for a double

major.” Williams adds, “We are -

not trying to encourage double
majors but to allow students to
receive that recognition.”
Inorderto complete the double
major students must complete all
requirements for both majors as
they are. stated in the Davidson
course book in addition to the
completion of core requirements.

nition of hazing and prohibitions
on pledge activities on the other
side. Holmes says partially in jest
that students this year have read
the letter more closely than in pre-
vious years, and that has caused
some of the confusion.

No clustering for women
Not allowing freshmen
women to cluster created its own
difficulties. This meant some
women entered an eating house
feeling they knew no one in the
house. This was a source of con-
cern for many women Friday morn-
ing and afternoon, but after the
festivities in the evening many
women were optimistic. One fresh-
man women when asked if she had

many friends in the house she had
just joined said, “No. But I defi-
nitely think there are some poten-
tially very good friends.”
House distributions;

vast majority self-select

The distribution of freshmen
women into the three eating houses
was also an issue of concern. Many
freshwomen were not placed in the
house they chose first. The final
tally showed that 71 women were
placed in each Rusk and Connor
and 42 in Warner. A total of 184
freshman women out of 228, or
80.7%, chose to self-select.

One hundred thirty-four fresh-
man men out of 220, or 60%, chose
to pledge a fraternity. Twenty-

three chose Kappa Sig, 12 KA, 20
Phi Delt, 7 Fiji, 17 Pika, 20 SAE,
and 35 Sig Ep. Asaclass, 70.5%,
or 316 of 448 freshmen, chose to

join an eating house or afraternity.

Although some administrative
changes were made, activities on
Self-Selection night were not very
different from previous years.
There was no lack of tradition.

Fraternity pledges still let
loose their exhibitionist sides,
some several times: One pledge
ran through Rusk twelve times.
Women who self-selected into an
eating house enjoyed champagne.
Said one gloriously happy
freshwoman, “Oh my God, all the,
champagne!”
