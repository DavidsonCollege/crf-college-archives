CD:

Phish: Lawn Boy, Capital Rec-
ords
By Joe Binns

Ican’ttell youalotabout the
history of Phish. All I know is
what Leslie J. has told me. They
are from Vermont and have a
large following up on the north-
ern college circuit. They’ve put
Out two albums on their own
label, the most recent being
Lawn Boy and their drummer,
dressed as Captain Zero, has been
known to play an old style Elec-
trolux vacuum in concert.

And while this may seem a
little odd it is well within the
bounds of normalcy for Phish.
Their music is an aggressive
blend of jazz and rock very
reminiscent of Frank Zappa. The
four man band is a group of
musical over-achievers and their
product is steeped in theory and

technique. Itis asimprovisational
as Improvisation can sound on

an album and even after hearing
certain tunes ten or twelve times
they can still manage to lose you.

I would venture to guess that,
though the bulk of their tunes are
played from the hip, there is a
good chunk of reading going on.
Every one of the ten tunes on
Lawn Boy has sections way too
complex to be played without
notation.

They frequently change time
signatures, syncopated melodies

jerk a listener off balance. Make
sure you are seated when you
first hear this group.

The lyrics are nonsensical.
The following is atypical sample.
It is from Bathtub Gin:

Where is the Joker?

and bizarre instrumentation that -

Phish Are Not Fish

Have you seen him around with his
three coned hat

That he wears like a crown

Have you seen his striped stock-
ings and heard his sad tales
About the kids under the carpet
and the purple humpbacked
whales.

That’s as normal as it gets.

For musicians of Phish’s cali-
ber and creativity there are a lot of
doors open and the best thing about
this band is that they go through a
different one every time. Fee, the
story of a Buddhist weasel in love,
has a tropical color. My Sweet One
isconvincingly westem. Split Open
and Melt is a sublime jazz funk.

But these guys don’t just
sample styles, they have created
their ownand display it ferociously
in Reba, Run Like an Antelope,and
The Squirming Coil. Descriptions

of these styles would take at least
another three or four paragraphs

and I have to get a plug in for the
IPC [Editor’s note: Intimate Per-
formances Committee] before Ican
do any Spring Frolicking.

Just buy the disc and check it
out. You won’ tregretitif youhave
any affinity for jazz or creative
progressive music.

SHORT SHOW REVIEW
Colonel Bruce Hampton and the
Aquarium Rescue Unit, 900Room,
4/6/91

Once again Brad Reddick,
a.k.a. Guitarzan, (working on a
hint from a very dear and rhythmic
friend) did this campus incredibly
right and only a few musically on-
the-ball students took advantage

it. No one in the 900 Room last
Saturday will ever be quite the
same after Colonel Bruce. A great
show full of jazz/blues like
you’ve never seen, unless, of
course you saw the Unit in Char-
lotte the last time he was there.

I’ve seen this band a few
times before and I assure you
they were in rare form Saturday
night. Bassist O’Teal said that
the Colonel really loved the room,
its character and size, and espe-
cially the sound :system. This
made me very proud of our dear
old alma mater. The Colonel
himself, who insisted on calling
me Wayne, slurringly gave us
his personal seal of approval.

The group did acouple Dead
covers, a couple of traditional
blues tunes, unique and highly
creative and theatrical solos but
mostly justrocked old Unit tunes
like “Arkansas” and “Donkey
Song.”

My condolences to those
who missed it and let this be'a
warning to you. IPC is under
new management next year and
don’t let the opportunities that
they create pass you by.

Two ambitious and knowl-
edgeable youths, Sweet Pete
Jackson and Chris Hoveland have
taken over and are working on
bringing you theaforementioned
Phish (missing this show, if it
materializes, should result in ex-
pulsion), Stream of Conscious-
ness, getting Taj Mahal back and
many other treats. Eat them;
they’Il be good for you.

Restaurant:

Munching At Manzetti's

By Jeff Revis and Preston
Yarborough

Variety is the spice of life. From
the outskirts of Mooresville to the
innards of Charlotte, the
Davidsonian Restaurant Review
Team keeps a watchful eye for yet
another unheard-of eating experi-
ence. On the advice of this week’s
guest critic, Preston Yarborough,
we headed into Charlotte in search
of Frank Manzetti’s Bar and Grill.
Steve Sturm, an avid fan of Man-
zetti’s, also wanted to come along
and provided transportation.

We headed down I-77 toward
Charlotte. Taking the Tyvola exit,
we turned left at the light and
headed east on Tyvola. About 15
minutes and seven lights later, we
arrived at Southpark Mall. Driving
through the tunnel which runs
under the mall, we emerged on the
other side. We turned right, then
left onto Morrison Boulevard im-
mediately afterwards. Manzetti’s

was in the little shopping center on
the corner to our left, beside the
Park Hotel.

Preston said there were lots of
great cars in the parking lot. Both
Steveand Preston had already been
to Manzetti’s several times, but I
didn’t know what to expect. From
the first glance in the huge. win-
dows of this indoor cafe, I could
tell that Manzetti’s was tailored to
the Davidson student who would
like to practice his or her yuppy
skills before leaving college.
Manzetti’s Bar and Grill could be
renamed Manzetti’s Bar and Polo
Outlet. Even our waitress with the
great eyes wore a white Polo with
her green tartan Polo tie. When she
asked if we wanted anything to
order, we got into the mood of the
restaurant and answered, “Yup.”

"As we waited for the appetiz-
ers, I took the opportunity to look
around. The atmosphere was one
of style. Open and airy with its

high ceilings, miles of windows,
and brass railings, Manzetti’s is
certainly “California Dreaming” as
a picture on the wall suggests. We
especially liked the moose head
near the bar. Preston said the
mountain goats’ heads on the wall
reminded him of home.

Our appetizers came. Preston
and I got the onion-ring loaf and
Steve got the potato soup. Those
with heart conditions may want to
stay away from this greasy treat.
Steve liked-the homestyle soup.
Next came the salad, which came
topped with an interesting house
“honey-mustard” dressing. Instead
of a roll, croissants were served.
Our tea was refilled, actually re-
placed, whenever it dipped below
the halfway-mark. (Manzetti’s is
the type of restaurant which re-
places every fork or glass you use
during the whole meal.)

The steak came next. When I
heard the name Manzetti’s, I natu-

Concert:

Grateful Dead:
In Greensboro, NC

By Chip Petree

On March 31 and April 1, the
Grateful Dead returned to Greens-
boro Coliseum after two years on
their Spring Tour 1991. The band
was returning to the area for the
first time since they played in
Raleigh this summer, and thus it
was the first time in this area since
the death of keyboardist Brent
Mydland.

The shows were everything
people expected them to be. The
carnival atmosphere in the parking
lot of the Coliseum was less re-
stricted than in Charlotte in the fall
of 1989, and the crowd was al-
lowed to celebrate the occasion
pretty much as they pleased.
However, the parking lot scene
was merely a prelude to the two
shows.

The Easter Show was consid-
ered by some to bea Bruce Hornsby
spectacular. The firstset began with
Mississippi Half--Step Uptown
Toodledoo that featured Hornsby,
followed by Wang Dang Doodle
and Friend of the Devil. The first
set also included West L.A.
Fadeaway, Cassidy, and a closing
Might as Well.

Following the intermission was
Samson and Delilah and Eyes of
the World before Drums/Space.
The Eyes was almost 25 minutes
long and featured two immense
solos by Hornsby on his grand
piano and former Tubes’ keyboar-

- dist Vince Welnick on the key-

boards.

Thesetconcluded with Playin’
in the Band, The Wheel, Around
and Around, and a scorching
Johnny B. Goode, instigated by
guitarist Bob Weir. For the en-
core, the band played a mellow but
sort of cheesy Knockin’ On
Heaven’ s Door.

The April Fool’s concert was

considered by most to be the best
of the two. Jack Straw led off the
first set, followed by Peggy-O, All
Over Now, Candyman, TomThumb
Blues, Picasso Moon, and Bird
Song. All of these tunes sounded
excellent (as the Dead always do),
but the real excitement came in the
second set. China Cat Sunflower/I
Know You Rider opened the set,
followed by Looks Like Rain.

The strength of Weir’s voice
and Jerry Garcia’s guitar playing
worked in perfect harmony on this
last tune. Still, the crowd in the
Coliseum could sense that some-
thing special was going to happen,
and it did on the next song when
the band played Dark Star. This
rare treat mesmerized the entire
audience (except for the fifteen-
year-old Caboose fans behind me)
and set the stage for the entire
night. To close out the set from the
night before, Black Peter, (Turn
on Your) LovelighI, and encored
with Baby Blue.

Needless to say, the two shows
were quite exhilarating and ex-
hausting. The parking lot scene
continued on into the night after
both shows, with many people
commemorating the Dark Star
event.

One glaring difference be-
tween these shows and those of a
year ago is the absence of Brent
Mydland.

The Dead have successfully
replaced him with the (sometimes)
duo of Welnick and Hornsby, who
sound like they’ve been playing

‘together since birth. Maybe. the

Grateful Dead has found a perma-
nent solution to their keyboard
position. Hopefully, the chemistry
of the part-time Hornsby and the
full-time Welnick will keep. the
Dead rocking for years to come.

rally thought of Italian food. This
is definitely a steak house. Preston
and Steve wouldn’t let me order
anything but the house specialty.
Each vouched for the Mama Man-
zetti’s Chicken, which was very
similar to cordon bleu with melted
monterey jack and ham on top. I
opted for the filet mignon, which
was pretty reasonable at $12.95.
Preston decided on the 17 ounce
Kansas Strip and Steve got the 22
ounce Pittsburgh Cut.

The restaurant suggests that ev-
eryone order their steak a little
more well-done thanusual because
all the steaks run rare, Preston and
I really enjoyed our steaks which
were slightly blackened on the
outside and delicately pink in the
center. Steve couldn’t decide
whether to spit out his steak or
swallow it, but said that he’d had
good steaks all the other times he
had come to Manzetti’s. The fet-
tucini alfredo that’ came with our

steaks was fantastic.

Save room for desert if pos-
sible. Steve and I had the chocolate
mousse pie and Preston chose the
Kentucky Derby Pie, which was
an ice cream pie topped with pea-
nut butter. Both were extremely
good,

Overall, Manzetti’s. Bar and
Grill is a very good restaurant and

eared a four star rating on our
scale of five.

The decor was good and the
steaks are excellent. The service
was exemplary. ct

We recommend the’restaurant
for semi-formals and Saturday
Nights on the town. The prices
were reasonable, ranging from $4
sandwiches to $15 steaks. .

Keep your writing skills
sharp and write for The
Davidsonian in the Fall!
