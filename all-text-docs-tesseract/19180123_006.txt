did come down I was lost and after fly-
ing around a while I landed in a farm-
er’s field, found my direction to the
camp and set out again. Just as I got
in sight of the hangars my motor stop-
ped and I thought at first that my mix-
ture of air and gas was bad, but couldn't
get the engine started, so I knew my gas
was gone. I picked out a smooth field
and made a safe landing just about a
half mile from the camp and the mechan-
ics brought my machine to the hangar.
I arrived here, though, in time to sign
the payroll.

“Yesterday morning we started acro-
batics and I did my first ‘vrille’ (pro-
nounced ‘vree’). It is performed by
stopping the motor and when the ma-
chine has lost its speed, by means of the
controls throwing it over on its back.
Tt then falls nose down spinning like a
top with the fuselage (of body) of the
machine as an axis. It’s lots of fun and
a great sensation. Tomorrow I am to
learn to ‘tonneau’ or ‘barrel roll’ and
the ‘renversement.’ The tonneau is noth-
ing but a vrille performed straight in-
stead of down and the renversement is
almost the same as a loop except the
idea is to come out in the opposite direc-
tion. ‘They are not trying to teach us
the loop, as it is very easy to do and of
no value to us in air-flying. I’m going
to try it though, for the fun of it.”

he said, he has a $10,0v0 building, the
equal of any three times as costly in this
country.

The few words that Dr. Bradley
spoke concerning the Famine — Relief
Work of the missionaries vividly pictured
the poverty and need of the mass of the
people. ‘Ten per cent, he said, were the
property-holders and the remainder were
the poor, ignorant populace who were
asking what was the “Jesus Chtirch”
that was aiding them in their need, not
because they wanted to know Christ but
because they were interested in the ‘‘for-
eign devils” who helped them when even
their own government did nothing.

After this inspiring address blanks
were distributed to be signed and hand-
ed to a special committee that collected
them later in the evening. These blanks
were to allow the students to sign up
for the various mission study classes to
be held this spring. These classes cover
conditions and countries that should at-
tract the attention of every man in the
student body and they contain informa-
tion that every educated man _ should
have. Instead of 100 there should have
been nearly 200 men to join these classes.

They met for organization last Sun-
day morning at 10 o'clock, and anv other
students. wishing to join any of them
may still do so.

LARGE AUDIENCE HEARS

(Continued from page \)

used 1,026 ships, each capable of carry-
ing 1,600 tons. The toll taken by the
breweries far exceeds the toll of the
dreaded submarine. We should use every
ounce of strength, every possible dollar
and, if need be, every drop of blood for
the twofold purpose of defeating the
Hun abroad, the menace to the world.
and the “Hun” at home, the breweries
and distilleries. To get rid of the brew-
eries is to destroy the buzzard roost of
traitors and treason.

The breweries claim that beer is a
temperance drink, but a person who
drinks beer drinks so much that he gets
as much alcohol as the one who drinks
whiskey. If anything, beer is even worse
than whiskey, for it brutalizes the drink-
er. Beer has been the bread and meat
and milk of the Germans, and this fact
no doubt helps to explain their cruelty
and utter lack of kindness.

May the time soon come, and it will
come, for it is right, when the liquor
traffic no longer exists under the folds
of “Old Glory.”
