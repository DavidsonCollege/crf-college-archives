Cagers gird for Notre Dame

By DEAN EKLUND

Have the Cats come far
enough to compete with Notre
Dame? Davidson, fresh from a
62-60 victory over The Citadel
which extended its winning
streak to two games, runs into
Notre Dame Saturday at
Greensboro. The game is be-
ing televised by NBC-TV,
starting at 4 pm.

Coach Dave Pritchett does
not feel the Cats will suffer
any let-down going into the
Notre Dame game. ‘“‘There is
no problem getting up for a
team like Notré Dame. But
we've (Davidson) been up
pretty much the whole year.”

Coach Pritchett said about

the effect of the William and
Mary game on the players,
“They'll take a look at them-
selves and see how much they
have improved. It’s a question
of self-confidence.”’

Pritchett is aware of how a
good game against the Fight-
ing Irish will affect his team,
“Tt instills pride in our people
when we show we.can be
competitive. against any team
in the country. It is also
something extra for our kids
to face players from a national
standpoint, for Pat Hickert, to
play against Toby Knight: or
Bruce Flowers and. for Ernie
Reigel to play against: Durk
Williams.”’

Pritchett plans no major
surprises-in preparing for the

game against Notre Dame,
“We will have to be extremely
disciplined on offense and play
great defense—only allowing
one shot, preferably an outside
shot.

“We'll start out in a man-to-
man defense so our people will
know match-ups in case we
press or there is a last-second
shot. If they (Notre Dame)
hurt us on a mismatch
because of our size we'll try to
give help inside by going to a
zone..”

Owens’ rebound
secures Cat win

By DEAN EKLUND
Staff Writer

Davidson won its second
game of the week, barely
getting by The Citadel 62-60
last night.

Davidson led most of the
game, but the contest was
never secure until Rod Owens
pulled down the rebound from
Robert Hoak’s missed shot at
the buzzer.

Davidson was led by John
Gerdy who was 12 for 18 from
the floor and 4 for 4 from the
line for a game high 28 points
and Rod Owens who had 16
points on 8 field goals in 14
attempts.

Rod Owens finally put the
Cats out in front with 9:16
remaining in the first half with
a follow of his own miss to put
Davidson ahead 19-18.

Gradually adding. to the
lead, primarily on long range
jumpers by Gerdy (who was 8
for 10 in the half), Davidson
hit its biggest lead at halftime
29-24, when Owens hit a shot
with 0:02 left in the half.

The margin separated the
two. teams in the second half

fluctuated between an 8 point
Davidson lead, 39-31 with
15:25 remaining in the game to
a one point Citadel lead, 48-47
with 8:30 remaining in the
game.

The Cats appeared to have
the game won with 1:22 re-
maining as Owens hit 2 free
throws to put Davidson ahead
61-56. However, Citadel hit
two quick baskets to cut
Davidson’s lead to one point
with less than one minute
remaining.

Pat Hickert hit one of two
free throws to give the Cats a
62-60 lead with 10 seconds
remaining.

The Citadel got the ball to
Hoak, and Hoak drove on
Reigel. Reigel explained his
defensive strategy, ‘I wasn’t
going to give him (Hoak) a
lay-up,-I wanted him to shoot

. 4s far away from the basket as

possible and to make sure |
put a hand in his face. “But I
didn’t want to foul him and
give him a three point play. It
was a good shot.”

It didn’t fall through, and
Davidson had its fifth victory

of the year.

IN WOMEN’S IMAC action, Susan Reid heads down court as Paula Kadison husties
to the defense.
