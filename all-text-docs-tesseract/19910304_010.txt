The Incredible Ease Of Well-Being

Avoid Fat With These Facts

By Marlo Cobb

Fat is necessary in the body, in
certain percentages (around 9-21
percent for men; 15-25 percent for
women). Bodyfat is an insulator,
and itcushions the internal organs.
It is the body’s greatest source of
stored energy, providing for the
muscles after other energy sources
are depleted. It helps absorb vita-
mins A, D, E and K, and provides
moisture to the skin.

Going below ideal body fat per-
centages will cause hormonal
imbalances, and for women this
means that the menstrual cycle will
stop. People with too little body fat
will feel generally hotter during
the summer, and colder during the
winter, and their hair and skin will
be dry. Too much fat in the body,
however, causes deficiencies in the
immune system, and increases the
risk of hypertension and heart dis-
ease, and diabetes.

So, why is fat so tempting? It is
a flavor carrier in food. Fat adds
richness and texture:to food. This
is a hard property to manufacture
artificially. As one employee in-
volved with the newly marketed
fat substitute Simplesse says, “It’s
good-tasting, butit’s justnot good.”

The problem with fat is that too
many Americans eat too much of
it. No more than 30 percent of the
calories we eat each day should
come from fat, and this is a lot to
ask because one cup of fat (short-
ening) can contain up to 17 times
the calories of a cup of carbohy-

Theatre Review: The Merchant Of Venice

By Kate Dunlop

The Merchant of Venice, a
Shakespearean romantic comedy
with the underlying theme of ra-
cism, opened last night in Hodson
Hall.

Under the direction of Dr.
Joseph Gardner, the story of Portia
(Keely Schneider), a young heir-
ess, and her friends and foes un-
wound.

In his will, Portia’ s father stated
that three caskets, one of gold, ope
of silver, and one of lead, were to
be laid out for would-be suitors of
his daughter to choose from. Only
one of the caskets would be the
right one, containing within it the
blessing of Portia’s hand in mar-
riage. While Portia and her maid
and companion, Nerissa (Marya
Howell), are testing eligible bache-
lors, high-powered merchant-
gangsters are making deals in the
city.

Antonio (Ed Cunningham), a
young business man_ borrows
money from the bitter, yet success-
ful Jew, Shylock (Guest. artist,
Graham Smith). The condition
states that if Antonio does not pay
themoney back intime, he isbound
to give Shylock a pound of his
flesh.

The two stories come together
when _ Bassanio (Bryan Kirtley),
Antgnio’s best friend, chooses the
casket which promises him Portia.
Immediately after, he receives
word that Antonio’s time is up and
that he must deliver to the merci-
less Shylock. Adding to Shylock’s

“wrath is the flight of his daughter,

drates (like potatoes).

Mostly what needs to be
watched are saturated fats, thatis,
animal fats like butter, plus coco-
nut oil and palm oil, all of which are
solid at room temperature. (Un-
saturated and monounsaturated
fats include vegetable, olive, and
peanut oil.) When you are trying to

keep blood cholesterol level down, :

it is more important to avoid satu-
rated fats than dietary cholesterol
itself. Any food item marked “No
Cholesterol” may still be high in
saturated fat, so read labels before
you buy. A meal high in saturated
fats will temporarily raise blood
cholesterol levels. Metabolic rate
is also raised slightly higher aftera
high-fat meal than after a high-
carbohydrate meal.

After a diet, pounds of fat are
regained three times faster than
pounds of muscle, and muscle tis-
sue at rest burns more calories than
fat tissue does, so any regained fat
essentially lowers the metabolism.
Dietary fatis converted more read-
ily into body fat than carbohydrates,
and then fat is not burned during
the first 12 minutes (some say 20)
of aerobic exercise; carbohydrates
are what is being burned during
that time.

At least two separate studies
show apositive correlation between
the amount of saturated fat in a
person’s diet, and how fat the per-
son is (bodyfat percentage).

The first places women tend to
lose fat are the waist and thighs,

Jessica (Allison Wright), who runs
off with Lorenzo (Michael
Crowley), a friend of Antonio and
Bassanio. The denouement is
brought about by Portia’s ingenius,
and everyone lives happily ever
after in the end.

The sets and colorful 1940s-
like costumes
gave off a.
wonderful at-
mosphere of
fun, romance,

then the buttocks and upper arms.
The hardest bodyfat to lose for
women is on the hips, shoulders,
chest, and calves.

You may have heard of a way to.
figure your body fat percentage by
using acalculation involving height
and weight. I don’t recommend
this; it doesn’t take into account
that muscle tissue weighs 10 per-
cent more than fat. Try the skin-
fold/caliper method instead. It’s
pretty accurate, when done by a
professional.

On to a topic that may be of
interest to those of you who are
“stuffed up.” On the back of a
bottle of Afrin nasal spray, it says,
“Do not use this product for more
than three days.” Using nose drops
or nasal spray for more than three
days causes a “rebound effect”
which actually increases conges-
tion.

And if you have a sore throat,
drinking either hot or cold liquids,
gargling with warm salt water, and
breathing in moist air will help.
Try this: while running very hot
water in the sink, lean over and
breathe in the steam for a few
minutes. Put a towel over your
head to trap any escaping steam.

Anesthetic sprays and drops
temporarily numb. a sore throat,
but that’s all; they won’t kill cold
germs.

. Now more than ever, student
involvement and cooperation with
recycling efforts are essential to
insure a successful transition to
the institutionalization of recy-
cling. Members of the Recycling
Committee, including new com-
mittee coordinators, Sarah Sadow-
ski and Bina Desai, faculty spon-
sor, Dr. Dan Boye, and service
coordinator, Beth Duttera, are
working with the physical plant to
institutionalize Davidson’s recy-
cling in the near future. This tran-
sition should provide much needed
relief to the all-volunteer recy-
cling committee which has
struggled to meet the demands of
increasing campus-wide partici-
pation in recycling.

Despite such efforts towards
advancement, the committee asks
that students remain aware of the
importance of their cooperation
and consideration. Under the cur-
rent system, student volunteers

is greatly facilitated by students
who sort their recyclables, empty
their containers, and refrain from
placing garbage and other refuse

mittee also asks that the bins be
used for recycling only and be left

pecially for sorting at the shed on

tee are urged tocome to organiza-

walked on stage. Her attention to
detail, down to every last gesture
and expression was magnificent.
Her scenes with Nerissa and
would-be suitors, The Princes of

_ Morrocco.and Arragon were hi- |

larious.

Michael C. Brooks as the arro-
gant, yet “cool” Prince of Mor-
rocco strutted about the stage

dressed as a “Rap King,” and had

played by Bryan Kirtley, had abso-

lutely no chemistry with Schnei- ;

der’s Portia.

Of course, every scene with
Schneider shone, but the lack of
connectedness between the couple
was disappointing. When paral-
leled with Jessica and Lorenzo,
played by Allison Wright and Mi-
chael Crowley, their love story
faded into the background. Every

seemingly light-
hearted play to troubling dimen-
sions which forced the audience to

~ look at the implications of racism.

After his. daughter, Jessica, runs
away, Shylock rages and gives the
famous “Hath not a Jew eyes?...”
speech. Smith completely blew me
away.

The courtroom scene in which
Portia, dressed as a man, tries to
convince Shylock to spare Anto-

nio, was one of the strongest scenes
in the play.

The tension, generated mainly
by Smith, Schneider, and Cunning-
ham, as Antonio, literally poured
off the stage. Smith’s defeated exit
was brilliant, and completely be-
lievable.

As an audience member, I felt
lucky to be watching him, so I can
only imagine what working with
him must have been like for the
cast.

Other noteworthy perform-
ances included those of David
Tweedie as Shylock’s cocky ser-
vant, Launcelot, and Miles Louria
and Russ Felker as Stephano and
Balthasar, Portia’s attendants.

Tweedie was both adorable and
strong in hisrole, receiving a lot of
laughs from the audience for his
energetic performance.

Louria and Felker gave a new
meaning to the old saying, “There
is no such thing as a small role;
there are only small actors.”

Both of them were wonderful -
to watch, adding humorous touches
tocharacterize their smaller roles.

Overall, the cast gave a good
and highly enjoyable performance
of one of Shakespeare’s classics.

- Although there was a lack of
unity and connectedness amongst
the cast as a whole, certain strong
performances carried the play.

I will forever be haunted by
Portia’s strength, Shylock’s pitiful
defeat, and the beauty of Jessica _
and Lorenzo’s love story. Si
