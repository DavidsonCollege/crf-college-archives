Bicycle Thefts Plague Davidson

By Virgina Mischen

One Sunday nighta few weeks
ago, sophomore Alden Smith left
his $500 mountain bike
in the bike rack behind
Belk dorm. When he
went to ride it early the
next morning, it was
gone.

Bike theft has be-
come a common occur-
rence on today’s college
campuses, especially as
students purchase more
sophisticated-- and more
expensive--bicycles.
Already this fall over 19
bikes have been stolen
at Davidson.

According to Ray Thrower,
Director of Public Safety and Po-
lice, bike theft could be prevented
“if everyone practiced good crime
prevention techniques.”

He encourages the use of the
horseshoe locks, which can only
be cut with a blow torch. Cable
locks are apparently not very se-
cure. Campus Police is seeing a
growing number of cases in which
these locks have been cut and the

register their bicycles with Cam-
pus Police. Thestudent simply fills

Most of the manufacturers of | out an information card with the

the horseshoe locks guarantee their
locks with a warranty covering the
cost of the bike if it is ever stolen.
Thrower stresses, however, that
this warranty is conditional upon
the correct use of the lock. If stu-
dents lock the wheel of their bike
to the rack and not the frame, a
thief can easily remove the frame
which is the most expensive part of
the bicycle.

Thrower also urges students to

bicycle make and serial
number, and his or her
driver’s license number
is then engraved on the
bike.

Many times
thieves immediately
paint or “fix up” a bike
to make it harder to rec-
ognize. If the police have
a record of these num-
bers, they can identify a
stolen bicycle.

~~ them tothe Public Safety
office at any time. For student }.
convenience, officers have been
registering bikes at different sta-
tions on campus. On Monday,
September 30, they will be at the
Senior Apartments.

If astudent’s bike is stolen, he
or she should immediately reportit
to Campus Police. An officer will

Physical Plant Joins Students
In The Recycling Campaign

From the Recycling Committee
This year marks a new era for
recycling at Davidson. The Physi-
cal Plant has institutionalized re-
cycling in the dorms and provided
‘dumpsters for the removal of re-
cyclables. Students no longer need
to remove the recycling buckets
from the dorms. Students simply
have to carry their to the recycling
centers Jocated in the dorms.
Recycling centers are located
in the following areas: the lounges
of Little, Watts, Cannon, and Sen-

telle; the trash closets on the first
and second :floors of Duke; the
trash closets in Richardson; the
first floor storage closets in the
wings of Belk; and the second floor
trash rooms in Knox, Akers, and
Irwin. Recycling in the dorms re-
lies on student willingness to carry
their k the few extra feet to the
recycling bins.

The rest of the recycling pro-
gram is the same as last year. The
apartments must put their re-
cyclables out by 12:00 pm on Fri-

day to be picked up. The recycling ;
committee is currently. working |”

with the Physical Plant to build

permanent recycling bins by the |

apartments. Students also pick up

office paper from all the academic |
buildings on campus on a weekly |

basis.

Patterson Court houses can |
place their recyclables on the curb
by 12:00pm on Friday tobe picked |

up. Anyone interested in helping | yp,
