This section of The Davidsonian is strictly
devoted to the funny doings of funny people
and those who try to be funny. To the new
men we wish to give the following tip: “If
you don’t know how, to be funny just act
natural and your name is sure to appear with
astounding frequency in these columns, that
is, if you all are as green as those who have
been unfortunate enough to have their green-
ness discovered the first week. ‘

We place the funniest joke first—Fresh-
men !

Westbrook—What an ugly Freshman!
Bordeaux—People who live in tin houses
should refrain from casting can openers.

Pete says that the funniest thing he saw in
Georgia this summer was a hen sitting on an
axe trying to hatchet.

Aesop 13.

Once upon a time a college boy returned to
college and his best friend met him at the

station. He didn't ask him if he’d had a nice
summer.
Moral: Always tell them before they havé

time to ask.

PRINCE ALBERT has been the campus favorite
since the days of long-haired fullbacks, high
button shoes, turtle-neck sweaters, and hand-
painted dormitory cushions. This same won-
derful tobacco is even more popular in these
days of plus-fours.

And no wonder. Throw back the hinged
lid of the familiar red tin and release that rare
aroma of real tobacco! Tuck a load into your
pipe and pull that fragrant P. A. smoke up the
stem! That’s Prince Albert, Fellows! Nothing
like it anywhere,

When problems press and your spirits slip
over into the minus column, just get oft your
jimmy-pipe and load up with this really friendly
tobacco. P. A. is so kind to your tongue and
throat and general disposition. Buy a tidy red
tin today.
