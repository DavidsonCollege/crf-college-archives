Alumni Giving Vital Part
In Strengthening College

Alumni giving has become a pivotal factor in financial
strengthening of colleges and universities, the Council for,
Financial Aid to Education. Inc.. asserted in releasing a cost-
of-education survey report of 753 American colleges and
universities.

ends thé year in the blue or red:
institutions which trained them is
a criterion used by an increasing
number of corporations to deter-
mine their own support.

Students at’privately supported
colleges and universities pay from
40 to 60 per cent. of the costs of
educating them: students of state-
supported institutions pay 20 per
cent of the educational. dollar, the
Council's survey, showed. According
to a tabular summary ending the
report, the gap is widening be-.
tween. income from tuition and in-
stitutional costs in spite of tiution
increases. | .

Rising costs of education have
far outstripped tuition increases in
all institutions of higher education
excepting the professional and
technological schools, according to
the survey. These specialized
schools increased their tuitions
roughly in direct proportion to
cost increases. .

But in the privately-supported
colleges and universities, the cost
of educating each full-time student
rose 39 per cent at 84 Catholic col-
leges. 45 per cent at 66 independent
universities, 46 per cent at 184-in-
dependent liberal arts colleges
(mondenominational), 49 per cent
at 125 church-related (non-Catho-
lic) colleges, 58 per cent at 26
church-related (non-Catholic) uni-
versities, and 61 per cent at 21
Catholic universities. These  in-
creases were over the five-year-
span ending with the academic
year 1952-53.

Respective tuition increases for
these institutions were only 29, 30,
24, 23, 26 and 27 per cent during
the five-year span ending with the
academie year 1953-54. In the com-
parable five-year periods, 113 tax-
supported colleges found that their
costs rose 44 per cent but they
raised tuition only 25 per cent; and

The highest average cost of op-

full-time student per institution;
and at the 80 professional and tech-
nological schools which averaged
$1065 ‘per fulltime student per in-
stitution.

Privately-supported colleges and
universities therefore attach in-
creasing importance to the annual
giving by alumni. the Council
stated in the survey report. Gifts
to the alumni fund area form of
repayment of a loan by society, it
said. These are. not only a means
of supplying a person's alma mater
with badly needed funds for cur-
rent operations but they are a
means of repaying the costs of
education.

Gifts by alumni to their colleges
have double force, the -Council
pointed out. Business concerns,
now being asked increasingly: to
help support the nation’s colleges
and. universities, have a clearly
stated preference for those whose,
alumni already are helping in a
substantial way. They regard their
gifts as a supplement to, not a
substitute for. alumni giving. Sev-

eral companies, led by General]

Electric. are now offering to match
(up to $1,000) annual gifts to the
respective alumni funds by col-
lege graduates in the Company's
employ.

Sigma Pi Sigma Hears
Geometry Program

Sigma Pi Sigma Physics Honor
Society held its regular meeting on
Tuesday, 20 March, in the physics
classroom in Chambers Building.
Ralph Long presented a program
on “Non-Euclidean Geometry,” in
which he gave special emphasis to
Riemann geometry. He stated that
there could easily be a fourth di-
mension in our universe, even
though we are unable to realize it.

To illustrate this point Ralph
proposed the example of a creature
on a spherical universe. To him
his universe consists of only two

}Tdimensions but we who are look-

ing on easily see his third dimen.
sion. Perhaps the same thing is
true with our universe—we realize
only three dimensions, but. a spec-
tator outside our universe could
possibly see a fourth.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Biology Department
Offers Field Trip to
Far Western States

Recently a new course has been
placed on the curriculum of the
Davidson Summer Session. Bi-
ology 82, field biology, has been
placed on the schedule for those
students who wish to further
their study in biology.

This is a course designed to
broaden the biological horizons
by offering first hand contact
with plant and animal life in
physiographic provinces and
biological life-regions remote
from the student’s ordinary edu-
cational program.

Biology 11 and 12 will be pre-
requisite for the course. The
credit due at completion of the
course will be three hours. A
final examination will be given
at its termination. The proposed
time for the course will be the
three weeks immediately follow-
ing the first six-weeks term of
summer school or the last. three
weeks of the summer session.

The emphasis of the field
course will be the southern
Rocky Mountain region and por:
tions of the arid southwestern
and south-central part of the
country. Since travel is to be
done in either two or three cars,
the enroliment will be limited to
either eight or twelve.

The route of travel will be
from Davidson to the Ozark
Mountains, across parts of Okla.
homa and Kansas, to southern
Colorado; southward through]:
western Colorado to southern
New Mexico; eastward across
southern New Mexico and central
Texas to coastal Texas and Loui.
siana; thence back to Davidson.

Since the students will be camp
ing out for the entire trip. there
will be no lodging expense. An
estimate of the trip is $150.00
which includes transportation,
food, and the college fees.

Anyone interested in this
course should see either Dr.
Daggy or Dr. Brown before June.

DAVIDSONIAN SALUTES COACH CLEMENTS| Daaveal| Wildeat of Week

By JOHN JOHNSON

One of the best known smiles
on the Davidson campus belongs,
to a star member of the athletic
department—head baseball coach
Chuck Clements.

Under the tutorship of genial
Chuck, the Wildcat baseballers
have reached their highest point
of success in recent years; their
1955 record of twelve wins and
five losses was the best since
1933.

The key to his ability as a men.
tor is his thoroughness; he knows
exactly how to coach each posi-
tion on the team. His cut-off pat-
terns are so effective opposing
coaches have made personal re.
quests for them. Few people who
have watched the Wildcat bunch
have failed to be impressed by
Clement's antics in giving signals.
He is a magician in that skill.

The most avid fan of Chuck's
team is his wife, a devoted sports
follower and particularly of base-
ball. The Clements, as anyone
who has frequently visited “Se
gym knows, have a three year old
son, Chuck, Jr. With the bound-
less energy which little Chuck
possesses he could, in a few
years, be the greatest athlete
Davidson ever had. Little Chuck,
who has no small amount of ath-
letic knowledge “himself, aroused
considerable attention last year!
when he followed his unknowing:
father out to the mound during a
game to talk matters over with a
faltering pitcher. |

Upon his release from service
in 1943, he entered Catawba Col.
lege where he lettered in foot-
ball, basketball, and baseball. He’
was proficient ‘in all three and
versatile enrugh to play ‘tackle,
guard and enc on the football:
team. After graduating in 1947

late Coach Kirkland.

In the fall of 1947 he joined
with Bill Dole at Fayetteville
High School where the pair pro-
duced two consecutive — state
champion teams. When Dole
moved to Eastern Carolina, Chuck
transferred to Gastonia . High
School and continued his winning
ways. Four of the five starting in-
fielders of the current Univer-
sity of North Carolina baseball
team were proteges of Clements
at Gastonia.

Coach Clements rejoined Bill
Dole at Davidson in 1952.

Chuck coaches the line and
works particularly with ends. He
is recognized. as one of the best
scouts in this region of the
country. Scouting for weakness
in opposing teams is the work
Clements enjoys most and con-
sequently he studies most of the
Wildcat's gridiron opponents.

Dave Pearsall Displays Backhand That Has Aided Him In Victory March

By CHARLES McGOWAN

The ‘freshman netter, David
Pearsall, receives honors this
week by being chosen Wildcat of
the Week. This young hustler
looked good at the very begin-
ning of the season and has been
‘improving ever since.

Pearsall came to Davidson from
Myers Park High in Charlotte.

There he was a top-notch, all-
round athlete, but found that
tennis was his real game. Two
years ago he won the State High
School Singles championship and
last year he was No. 1 on the
Mustang squad. .

After a few weeks of ‘practice
plus a few place matches, Pear-
sall found himself holding down
the No. 2, spot at Davidson. He

he remained at the college to as:| Coach Clements, Astute Baseball; has also joined hands with Semi

sume the job of assistant to the

Mentor

Mintz to form the No. 2, double

team. In both of these positions
Pearsall is doing his job well.

Pearsall’s record so far in the
season is an excellent one for
a freshman who has had no ex-
perience in college competition.
He made the entire southern
spring tour and all of his oppo-
nents vwerc tyrned away in defeat.
Michigan State is the only team
who has matched Pearsall with a
victor. His best match was in the
Colgate meet when he beat Abra-
hamso.

With a career in chemical engi-
neering in mind, Pearsall plans to
be at Davidson only three years.
He is, and will be as long as he
is here, one of the stronger men
of the Davidson Netters. David-
son feels fortunate in having him
with her and wishes him success.
