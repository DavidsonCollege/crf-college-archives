Dear Ed.:

We think not. Ii we recollect rightly, it
was the same thing that the Whale said to
Jonah, that Eve said to the apple, that the
Wolf said to Little Red Riding Hood, and

This department has lately been installed
for the information of all the students. It is
their privilege to ask any question, and if
we can’t answer it, we'll find one who can.
Several interesting queries in this week's lot.

Dear Mr. Kugler: baby’s milk in. Unele Bud.

We suggest that you paint a black spot on
the end of a log. The rabbits will think that
this is a hollow log, run against it and dash
their brains out. All you have to do is rake
them up. Another good method is to get
under a brush pile with your gun and make
a noise like a turnip. Rabbits dearly love
turnips and they will come running. You
should get a lot of them this way.

I knock them any distance. What can I do
to remedy this?

begin now, saving that if they neglected
put off, there would atime
when they would be unable to accem-

He advised them to begin meeting and

Dear Mr. Bachman:

A good plan is to rub a little asafoetida on
the ball and with a little practice you will be
able to run them down no matter where they
are, Another good way is to tie an end of a
string to the ball and let the string unwind
as the ball travels. All you have to do is
follow the string. Q. RB.

Plots and Personalities, by Edwin
E, Slossom and June E. Downey, leads
the group of new books recently obtain-
cd by the Union Library. “Queerest
book ever published” the way one
critic describes it. Another epitomizes
its contents in his statement: “A fas-
cinating book about fiction-making; not
only the sort of stories that are publish-
ed in magazines and boks, but such aec-
tivities of the imagination as day-dream-
ing, plain lying, gossiping, creating a
companion to talk to, ete. It is humor,
philosophy, what not; it is one of the
Most interesting boks ever published,
and one of the queerest.”

Another of the group, Some Aakers
f American Literature, is from the pen
of the popular literary critic, William
Lyons Phelps. The tithe gives the gist
the bok. Accurate estimates of our
greatest literary men are embodied in
Professor Phelps’ work, The Man

dramatically contrasted in the study of
