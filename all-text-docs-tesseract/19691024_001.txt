cording to its author.

John Baker, President of
the Beta Thet& Pi frater
nity, presided at several pre
liminary meetings and led
the fraternity presidents into
making the resolution, which
supported: the ‘spirit of the
Interfraternity Council

This proposal for united
fraternity contributions to
the community includes plans
for a lecture’ series sponsor
ed by the IFC and a special
weekend

o

The statement said in part
that ‘‘as a co-ordinator for
the efforts of soyge 70 per
cent of the student body, the
IFC should assume.a new
role of importance as a func
tional and representative
student organization. This is
not intended to herald a re
surgence of ‘fraternity poli
tical power’ or ‘fraternity na
tionalism.’ "

Baker. said that the state
ment was conceived in par
tial response to the rather
unclear definition. of | the
IFC's’ base of power.

The proposal has been ap
proved and endorsed by all
the presidents of the twelve
fraternities at a meeting of
the house presidents last
Thursday, October 16.

NUMBER FIVE

i ‘é ‘
' Presidents’ Letter
We, the undersigned fraternity representa-
tives, do hereby reaffirm our unqualified sup-
port of and respect for the Interfraternity Coun-
cil at Davidson College. We wish not only to in
sure its viability but also ot promote it as a
dynamic and functional part of the College Com

gcc

munity.

er cc manna aa et

We sincerely believe that the time has come
to end the IFC’s passive role on this campus.
The IFC can and should function as a much-
needed ‘“‘liaison’’ not only .between the frater-
nities but also between fraternities and the Col-
lege Community as a whole. Such a positive re-
lationship between the ‘Hill’ and the “Court”
would be’ beneficial to all concerned. The IFC,
with the united support of all fraternities, could
enhance this relationship,

> The present “authority” of the IFC is ill-
defined, Lack of support for the IFC has placed
its usefulness and even its existence in a very
questionable light. We only wish to assure the
College Community that henceforth the IFC,
with the support of the fraternity members, will
play an active part in the social and academic
life of Davidson College. This is a promise which

will be kept.

We promise that the fraternities, through
the IFC, sponsor social and educational activities

for the entire College Community
end” and an “IFC Lecture Serie

An “IFC Week-
s’’ have already

been discussed and approved by the undersigned
representatives. Such functions would be open
to the College Community as, a whole.

As the

“co-ordinator” for

the efforts of

some 70°c of the student body, the IFC should
assume a new role of importance as a functional

4

and representative student organization. This is

+ not intended to herald a resurgence of “frater- |
nity political power’” or “fraternity nationalism.”
Rather, it is a united effort on the part of con- ~

as useful as possible.

cerned individuals to make the present system

We, the undersigned, therefore-resolve to ©

© support, our words with actions. We feel that —
our efférts will be in the best interests of the ©

entire College Community. This is our positive
contribution-to Davidson College.

Threats To M-Day

‘Protesters Denied

By JOHN McLEAN
Managing Editor

Col. Virgil Foster Wednes-
day denied that the ROTC
Department had’in any way
Threatened Advanced ROTC
students who participated in
the Vietnam Moratorium
Oct. 15. ;

Foster was commenting on
widespread rumors” which
intimated that ROTC per
sonnel had taken names of
MS IV studéefts* who partici
pated in Moratorium activi-

ties, called them to confer
with the professor of, mili
tary science, adyised them

not to participate in further
peace protests and threaten

‘ ed, to report their activities

on permanent military re-
cords.

Some elements in the many
rumors could not be either
confirmed or denied.

Foster said that ROTC
personnel had indeed ‘‘ob-
served’ the Moratorium pro
ceedings, and that he had
later held informal discus-
sions’ with three MS IV stu-
dents who had taken part in
Moratorium services. ~

But these discussions in
cluded, in Foster's word4,
“no criticism of ‘(the — stu
dents’) self-expression,” and
“absolutely no coercion not
to participate in any more
Moratoriums."

According to Foster, the
purpose of the discussions
was to inform the students of
the consequences such pro
test might bring if done
after the students induction
into the Army ‘and if they
protested in uniform

Foster said that“his coun

sel to students was under

‘taken “from the standpoint

of their eminence in the
Army” in the future. But,
he added, reports of stu
dents’ political activities are
not included in any file which
is passed on to the Third
Army

There still
grounds for

appears to be
doubt as to
whether ROTC personnel at
tended activi
ties for the purpose of spot

ting and identifying students
there.

Major Thomas Dixon said
“this wasn't purpose,”
but that they were present
