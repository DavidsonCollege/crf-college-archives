Visiting Deans Discuss Plans

By ROBERT PYEATT
Staff Writer

Part of Davidson's competi-
tion in the small NMberal arts
coNege field laid its drawing
cards on the tables in front
of generally impressed stu-
dents and faculty members
during a campus visit Sunday
and Monday.

Leroy Greason, Dean of the
College at Bowdoin College in
Bowdoin, Me.. and Robert
Ward. Assistant Dean of Stu-
dents at Amherst College in
Amherst, Mass.. discussed pro-
grams at their schools and
possible curriculum innova-
tions at Davidson with the
Blue Sky Committee and its
Student Life Subcommittee
Monday.

Greason explained a ‘‘senior
center’ program Bowdoin in-
itiated three years ago, in

which senfors live in a spe-
cial residence hall with class-
room facilities and take one
or two seminar courses in sub-
jects outside their major field.
Ward discussed the new cur-
riculum AmherSt has initiated
this year.

‘*In the senior center at Bow-
doin, seniors are somewhat
separated — they are not ac-
tive in fraternities, the school
newspaper and yearbook. and
other busy activities. There is
more concentration on what
lies beyond college.’’ Greason
said in a Stimulus discussion
group Monday night.

“We are introducing them
to sophisticated topics outside
their major field. applying the
method and outlook they have
gained from three years of
liberal education,‘’ he contin-
ued. ‘‘The application of the

insights gained from the lib-
eral education is the basis of
our senior center program."

Ward characterized a liber-
al education as ‘‘an, attitude
of mind. a particular set of
mind. Our curriculum changes
are to allow more freedom to
let students turn to what in-
terests them."'

Both Greason and Ward
were brought to the campus
at the instigation of the Blue
Sky’s Student Life Subcommit-
lee.

Greason remarked that the
typical undergraduate course
is highly structured. The sen-
jor center program provided
experience in reading and ob-
taining basic information with
minimum direction, as a kind
of “pre-adult experience.'' The
program corrects the contra-
diction of a senior doing high-

ly sophisticated work in his
major field having to take a
tightly structured introductory
course in something that in-
terests him.

The senior center program
is expressly tailored to Bow-
doin, Greason emphasized. He
said that he would probably
not advocate this same pro-
gram for all other colleges.
It is also being constantly re-
examined, and several prob-
Jems have been noted in the
areas of faculty time and
course loads.

A pass fail grading system
is used in the senior center,
and part of its success can be
attributed to this, Greason be-
lieves. ‘It has helped to re-
duee tension between profes-
sor and students,"’ he explain-
ed. There is no longer the
pressure for a good grade."

“At Amherst we have inde-
pendent study programs on a
pass-fail basis,"" Ward said.
“This is the only reasonable
system. Freshmen and soph-
omores must take inter-disci-
plinary courses for an educa-
tional tooling process. This is
to illuminate questions and
procedures and give them
preparation. After this we féel
they can function in less struc-
tured courses.”

Neither Amherst nor Bow-
doin is seriously contempiat-
ing inaugurating a system
with no grades whatsoever,
Greason and Ward pointed out.

There has been little criti-
cism of the senior center pro-
gram from the seniors them-
selyes, according to Greason.
However, he believes it has
caused criticism of other areas

‘Faculty Committee Urges
: Social Club Establishment

40 Must Now Agree jf
To Join For 1 Year

Establishment of a social
and eating club was approv-
ed and recommended to the
faculty by its Committee on
Fraternities, Clubs and So-
cial Life yesterday.

The recommendation depends
on 40 students agreeing to re-
main members for one year.
The deadline for this commit-
ment is April 15.

The group, which has adopted

the temporary name of Campus

Club. will be open to all stu-
dents.

Approval of the construction
of one or two houses for an or-
ganization like the Campus Club
was given by the Board of Trus-

UNLOCKING A NEW DOOR
Earnhardt Tries Out His Office

Earnhardt

Enthusiasm, Energy

Enthusiasm and energy seek-
ing any outlet from floor-pacing
to politics characterize Tom
Earnhardt, recently elected Stu.
dent Counci! president.

The tall, thin junior who can
best be found late at night work-
ing in his room in faded yel-
low ski underwear was describ-
ed by out-going council presi-
dent Chuck Matthews as one of
the hardest workers that the
council has ever had.

Earnhardt’s rise in student
government was fore-shadowed
in his first year at Davidson
as he became known for his
ready freshman-like salutation
of “Greetings” and for his de-
termined drive to raise suffi-
cient funds for an active debate
program, a goal which he ac-
complished despite the claim of
some that he antagonized some
of his benefactors by his per-
sistence.

This year he has_ initiated
more student participation in ap-
plicant recruitment by arrang-
ing for students to represent the
school at highschool College
Day programs. a project which
relieved pressure on the Admis-
sions Office as well as allowing
the school to he represented
more widely.

A second program in conjunc.
tion with the Admissions De-
partment has sent teams of stu-
dents out to high school assem-
blies to present general infor-
mation about post high school
education.

These two efforts have won
Director of Admissions H. E.
White's enthusiastic backing for

the balding history major from
Thomasville. ‘The most astound-
ing thing about Tom.” said
White. ‘‘is that he has carried
out the projects almost entirely
on his own, with a minimum of
help from me.

Earnhardt's detractors point
to his tendency to act in a scat-
ter-brained manner unless he
has a direct outlet for his ener.
gy. and they fear that his char-
acteristic ‘friendly dog’ manner
may limit his effectiveness in
driving for student goals.

Matthews asserted, however,
“One of his main contributions
is to show that some students
do have an interest in the col-
lege as a whole and do not gripe
to the administration. He should
do a tremendous job next year.”

forts to organize a group until
now have been unsuccessful.

“The total social affiliation
program should have little det-
timental effect on the club,”
according to the chairman of
the group's steering committee.
Franklin Anderson, ‘‘because
the Campus Club will be differ-
ent enough and offer enough
that it should have no trouble
gaining members.”

About 30 students sparked the
recommendation with a request
for eating facilities for the club.

The effort to organize started
six weeks ago. mainly among
freshmen. but now is composed
of more upperclassmen than
freshmen.

The proposal presented to the
committee called for an exten
sive remodeling of Lingle Man.
or, with the addition of a dining
room and kitchen facilities.

However: the committee de:
cided to leave to the faculty a
decision of whether to construct
a house or renovate Lingle Man.
or.
The group of students behind
the effort has chosen a steering
committee of nine members.
and occasionally eats together
in Wildcat A or B in the Union.

Under the plan approved in
principle by the faculty commit-

New Davidsonian Staff
To Publish Next Issue

A new staff will take over to
put out the next issue of THE
DAVIDSONIAN which will ap-
per two weeks from tomorrow.

The new staff appointed by
recently-elected Editor-in Chief
Sam Boyte will be headed by
Managing Editors Ed Embree
and Robbie Hooker and Sports
Editor Bob Reid. Bill Watson
will be business manager for
the coming year’s operations.

Charles McEwen will take
over the position of copy editor.
while Franklin Anderson and
Robert Pyeatt will become as-

sistant managing editors. Bob
Dunhain will be news editor.

Mike Johnson will be assistant
business manager. and Jack
Wellman will be advertising
manager.

Boyte expressed extreme
pleasure with the staff, pointing
to the professional experience
held by the majority of those
handling the coming year's
news and to the competence
which all have demonstrated in
previous DAVIDSONIAN opera-
tions.

tee. the club would receive a
seat on the IFC and participate
in rush. They would also re:
ceive Lingle Manor’s seat on the
Social Council.

Present members of Lingle
Manor would be guaranteed a
continuance of their present
privileges if they did not wish
to join the Campus Club.

However, the present Lingle
Manor group would be dissolv-
ed as a separate group.

Tentative plans worked out
by the steering committee call
for a variety of activities next
year. from off-campus parties
to student-faculty retreats on
campus issues.

The cost of membership in the

Campus Club is projected by
the steering committee to be less
than that of most fraternities.
An initiation fee will be re-
quired, but most of it will be re-
turned to a member in the form
of his last month's board when
he graduates or leaves the col-
lege. According to George. Cre-
tekos, treasurer for the group.
the fee is mainly for capital with
which to begin the group.

The steering committee is now
circulating copies of a statement
of commitment for students
wishing to join for next year.

The statement requires a $10
deposit by April 15 as an assur.
ance to the college of more than
passing interest in the club.

IFC Elects 5 Members
For New Social Council

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer

The Interfraternity Council
elected five members of the new
Social Council and postponed
Greek Week activities until April
17-21 in its Tuesday night meet-
ing.

Representatives of ten frater-
nities submitted 19 nominations
for the five Social Council posi
tions. Social Council chairman
David Jennings was present at
the meeting to discuss the qual-
ifications which members should
possess. ;

After remarks by each repre.
sentative about one of his nom
inees and recommendations of
specific candidates by Jennings,
the IFC chose rising sophomore
Sid Cottingham: rising juniors
Hal Young. John Durham. and
George Rogister and rising sen
ior Steve Sands.

The IFC agreed to postpone
selection of its official delegates
to the Social Council until after
all fraternities had completed
elections of new IFC representa.
tives; however. Sid Cottingham,
newly - elected IFC représenta-
tive of SAE, was chosen among
the five at-large delegates.

The decision to postpone Greek
Week was made because of a
number of complications with
the Apri! 3-7 date—difficulties in
arranging for the Monday night
banquet and securing a good
speaker, the need for additional
time by the IFC’s Greek Week
Committee. and the desire of
several fraternities for more
time to make preparations for
the week.

Additional business included a
discussion of possible pledge
projects, particularly assistance
with a kindergarten project for
underprivileged children, and a
decision not to award a Best

Pledge Class Trophy. An appeal
was also made by President Gus
Cochran for a halt to the pilfer-
ing of trophies and other items
from fraternity houses and for
return of those items taken.
Vice President Bobby Vagt an.
nounced that the IFC Judicial
Board would consist of Steve

Couch, Jim MacNair. Chip Vo.

gan and the presidents of Beta.
ATO and KA.

FULL HOUSE

Smith (L) and Driesel! Field Questions

Coaches Claim Subsidization
A Benefit To Whole College

By SOB REID
Assistant Sports Editor

The present policy of athletic
subsidization is necessary if Da-
vidson is to continue competing
with-better quality teams. coach-
es Homer Smith and Lefty Drie-
sell argued Tuesday.

Speaking at Open End. the
coaches also maintained that
subsidization does not channel
telling amounts of money from
academic considerations. The
program, they added. is also
useful to the college.

“We can't win unless we re-
cruit good boys.’’ said Driesell
before a crowd of about 250 fac-
ulty and students. ‘We're not
doing anything illegal or dam-
aging to Davidson College.”
Smith added. ‘‘We’re here to
clear the air on this issue."

However. several students and
faculty. lamented that the dis-
cussion did not serve to clear up
any issues, but merely revealed
the complexity of the problem.

“It comes down to a question of
values,"* said senior Ed Dwelle.
“The auestion is do you value

athletics at this school or aca-
demic fields?”

Driesell argued that subsidiza-
tion is necessary to compete
with good teams. He stated that
he was hired to build a success-
ful basketball program at Da-
vidson, and that scholarships
were necessary for this.

Smith and Driesell then main-
tained that subsidization does
not present the college with a
financial burden. Gate receipts
from basketball and football pay
virtually all the expenses of the
two programs, they said. but if
the college desubsidized these
sports, such action would erase
these gains.

Without these receipts, the
coaches argued, the college
would be forced to pay for basic
expenses of the sports from oth-
er funds. This, Smith and Drie-
sell maintained, would increase
the drain on the college's budget
by the athletic department.

Dr. J. G. Martin, professor of
chemistry and member of the
Davidson Self-Study Committee,
noted that the expenses of the

athletic program in 1953 stood
at 13% per cent of the net oper-
ating costs of the college. In
1963-64, that, figure had declined
to 10. per cent. Martin also noted
that the percentage of instruc-
tional expenses had risen from
38.8 per cent of the operating
budget in 1953 to 43 per cent in
1963.

The coaches also maintained
that subsidization does not
strain the college admission re-
quirements. ‘‘We have a boy in
Carlisle, Pa.. who is a cham-
pionship wrestler with 1500 col-
lege boards.”’ said Smith. ‘‘He
will come here on a football
scholarship.”

Widespread recruiting helps
publicize the college, Driesell
said, and therefore benefits the
academic side of the institution.
“When I go see a boy in Mary-
land, New Jersey or Oklahoma,”
Driesell said, “I give the coun-
seling office a profile of our stu-
dent body. They are always im-
pressed by our standards."

Admissions Director H. Ed-

munds White concurred that in
the last. six years the number
of qualified applications has ris-
en ‘phenomenally.

However. he stated that a va-
riety of factors may have con-
tributed to this rise. He declined
to credit any one consideration
as decisive.

Both coaches admitted. how-
ever, that they are unable to fig-
ure the financial cost of their
two sports. They argued that
problems like stadium deprecia-
tion, payments to ushers and
policemen and travel expenses
are often difficult to account for
in the budget and make assess-
ing total costs almost impos-
sible.

Both coaches denied any vio-
lations of NCAA regulations in
their recruiting or training pro-
cedures. “I don't see why, peo-
ple here complain.” Driesell
said. ‘‘when the head of the
NCAA complimented us on our
practices. Neither I nor Coach
Smith has ever done anything
in violation of NCAA rules.”
