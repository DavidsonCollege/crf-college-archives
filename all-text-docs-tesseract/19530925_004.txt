Cats Clash With Richmond’s Spiders Tomorrow Night

THE DAVIDSONIAN

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1953

Toss-Up Struggle Scheduled|F
As Cats Invade Richmond

Coach Bill Dole’s hustling Wildcats departed this morning for the stamping grounds of
the University of Richmond Spiders to meet the Spider footballers tomorrow night. Richmond,
one of the Cats’ two victims of last season, are a veteran aggregation, having lost only two
men via the graduation route last June.

FLEETEST FIELD
FEATURED ANNUAL
FROSH CAKE RACE

The fastest field in the history
of the Freshman Cake Race
finished the grueling 2-mile course
last Friday as the old records fell
before the present freshman ath-
letes. Pete Ashcraft took first
honors in setting a new record
of 8:34.5 minutes.

Ashcraft shaved almost 20
seconds off the old record held by
Archie Joyner of the present
sophomore class. Ted Baker who
finished just a few seconds behind
Ashcraft’s winning time also sur-
passed Joyner’s record.

The first twenty-five finishers in
order of their position are as fol-
lows:

Asheraft, Baker, Kiker, Bon-
durant, Fountain, Kimbrough,
Holshouser, Sharp, Campbell, Mal-
lory, Williams, Brown, Batten,
Hunter, Shaw, Hill, McCree, Har-
less, Rivers, Barringer, Walther,
Snider, Brown, Hunter, Jackson.

The Spiders opened their season
last weekend by trouncing the
Randolph-Macon gridders to the
tune of 28-0. The Virginians seem
to be much improved this season
and all indications point to a close
ball game.

The wildcats took the measure
of the Richmonders by 38-19 last
season for their only “at home”
victory of last year’s campaign.
Deke Houlgate, “Observer” sports
predictioneer, gave the Spiders 6
points over the Cats in his weekend
predictions.

Difference in Opposition

While Richmond rolled to vie-
tory over Randolph-Macon the hap-
less Cats were taking a soggy
trouncing at the hands of Bobby
Dodd's great Georgia Tech ma-
chine.

In Coach Dole’s own words to the
“Wildcat Club” in its most recent
bulletin, “We did receive valuable
experience, and the lessons we
learned under game conditions
will be much more impressive than
they ever could have been in prac-
tice sessions.”

In the Tech game Coach Dole
divided the squad into two teams
with the first-stringers well dis-

Opener

Last week Davidson's freshman football squad swung into
action with some 50 boys out for the team. As the week's
work progressed that number decreased by ten, but the real
football talent of the freshman class is still on the roster.

The freshmen have no regular

coach with varsity staff members! Coach Carroll Hambright will serve

working the coaching on a rotation
basis. Coach Carroll Hambright,
however, is the game coach for
the four games on the frosh sched-
ule.

in particular had some kind words
for the frosh.

Said the Wildcat mentor, “The
fall of ‘54 will see depth in the
Davidson football squad—some-
thing that is noticeably lacking
this year.”

Four-Game Schedule

The yearling team will compete
in a four-game schedule this sea-
son with their first game sched-
uled for October 10 against the
gtidiron forces of McCallie Prep
School in Chattanooga. The. second
game on the slate and the first
home game is scheduled for Octo-
ber 16, against the Little Purple
Hurricane of Furman University.

On October 31, the Wild Kittens
go against Georgia Military Insti-
tute here at Davidson while they
wind up their season with a con-
test against the freshmen from the
Citadel. As was mentioned earlier,

Work With Varsity

The Little Cats have held sev-
eral joint dummy scrimmages
with the varsity, but during the
course of next week there is a
full “live” scrimmage on tap.

There has been a great deal of
comment about the freshman
squad and the coaching staff will
back up the delighted words of
praise of Davidson fans. The line,
for instance, averages almost 200
pounds. Phe backfield is trim and
fast and the quarterback, Barney
Poole, has shown himself to be
a fine passer. All in all prospects
are good not only for the fresh-
men to be a great asset to the
varsity next year, but for a very
successful season for the little
Cats this season.

Here is a list of the men who
reported for workouts last week:
Belton, Brewer, Brooks, Cathey,
Campbell, Conger, Comer, Connell,
Campbell, D.M., Firor, Foil, Fret-
well, Finnegan, Gramley, Gaither,

There were no injuries. Said Dole,
“We plan to play our best team

Spiders Want Revenge
The Spiders will definitely be
out for revenge against the Cats

and Coach Dole expects a very|_

close battle. This tilt will give] |

Davidson fans some indication of
the course of Wildcat football for.
tunes for the remainder of the
year.

Leading the way as usual for
the Cats will be such stalwarts
from last season as Ben Craig,
captain, and Neil Graham, alter-
nate captain. Such other linemen
as Dickle Davis, Tom Owen, and
Bob Patton will brace the forward
wall.

Such men as Henry Brown, Jim
Thacker, Jim Shelton, and Johnny
Gray will probably lead the Cat
offensive attack.

‘PT’ Testing Plan
Used To Correct
Frosh Weaknesses

The recent freshman physical
tests of the in-coming freshmen
conducted by the Physical Educa-
tion Department resulted in the
successful completion of the tests
by about 50% of the class. This
number, of course, excludes all
those freshmen who are out for
frosh football and cross-country.

Mr. Paul Scott, director of ath-
letics here at Davidson, recently
summarized the department's
reasons for the administerings of
the test in disclosing the fact that
the tests were designed to detect
the part of the body of the testee
which most needs building-up.

By studying the various failings
of the various parts of the test
the instructors were able to de-
termine what type of class the par-
ticular freshman needs.

A new feature in Davidson sports

%y | life is about to come into existence

on the campus in the reality of the

Just to the north end of the
freshman football practice field
work has been begun on the much
awaited improvement. It is now
in the process of being grassed
and will probably be ready for

It is conveniently located and
is within easy access to the cam-

great help to the varsity and the
freshmen golf teams when their
seasons get under way again next
spring.

As yet no work has been done
on the proposed driving range
which -was to be built in conjunc
tion with the putting green. With
the golf course in the shape that
it is, this is a much needed and
desired improvement.

Pete Ashcraft stepped into Davidson’s sports limelight last Fri-| nothing but violenes as is so often

day as he set a new record in the annual Freshman Cake Race. ¢ci¢) Bullstin.

Ashcraft shaved almost 20
seconds off the old record held
by Archie Joyner of the sophomore
class. Pete's time was 8:34.5 as
compared to the old 8:52 mark.

Track and Cross-Country are no
new words as far as this friendly
frosh is concerned. Pete graduated
from Tennessee Military Institute
last year where he was one of the
most outstanding men on their
track squad.

During his last year at the Ten-
nessee school Pete won the Mid-
South title in the isile event as
well as placing sec nd in the 880-
yard run. In his pace-setting mile
in the Mid-South meet Ashcraft
was timed at 4:49.5.

Pete participated in the 440,
880, and the mile in his prep-
school days. Coach Whittle looks
forward to the time in the future
when the freshman can run with
both his varsity harriers and his
varsity trackmen.

Ashcraft has been a member of

the freshman Cross-Country team
since he arrived at school and will
probably be one of Mr. McGillis’
finest prospects for a successful
season for the frosh.

Cat Harriers Prepare
For Maryville Meet

Coach Pete Whittle’s Cross-Country team has been work-
ing out for the past two weeks with several of the ochtet
showing some great promise. The harriers open their season
on October 9, when the Maryville College runners journey

to the local course.

The team will face William and
Mary, Richmond, W & L and VPI
before the state and the confer-
ence meets which are all away
games.

When asked about the prospects
for his squad, Coach Whittle com-
mented very favorably about sev-
eral of his returning lettermen
who compose over half of the
squad, and revealed that he is very
enthusiastic over the Cats’ chances
of a fine season.

The men who are out for the
gruelling sport are Bill Shipley,
Homer Sparks, Floyd Feeney,
Andy Turner, John Handley, Dick
Lovette, Joe Caudell, Paul Alex-
ander, and Hershel Allen.

Shipley, Sparke Captains

Bill Shipley and Homer Sparks
serve as co-captains and along with
Floyd Feeney and Andy Turner
comprise the meat of the team.
The other four positions on the
squad are still, as yet, undecided.

Rush week has hampered the
workouts of the squad considera-
bly as sleep is an all-important
quantity in the endurance sport.

Next week will mark the begin-
ning of really steady training to
get ready for the first meet com-
ing up soon.

McGillls Coaches

Sam McGillis is the freshman
coach in Cross-Country. Mr. Mc-
Gillis has some fine boys on his
squad who Coach Whittle could
well use on the varsity squad.

First on the list of freshman
prospects is Pete Ashcraft who set
the pace for the recent Freshman
Cake Race. Another boy who has
looked good in early workouts is
Ted Baker who placed second in
the race.

Other members of the squed
include: Joe Brown, John Hill,
Russell Barringer, John Hols-
houser, Steve Huntley, Bill Jack-
son, and Gordon Bondurant. Great
thiags are expected of this team
who open their season the sam
day as the varsity.
