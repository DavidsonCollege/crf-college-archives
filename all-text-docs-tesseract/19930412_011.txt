Give & Take Relationship

In 1937, seeing the inequity created in the local schools by desegrega-
tion, Ada Jenkins asked Davidson College to donate the bricks from the
burned down Chambers Building to erect an improved school for A frican-
American students. (See page 6.) That school now serves as a center for
the community and as an example of how Davidson can give to the town.

But the school also takes. The entire Housekeeping Staff is made up of
members of the community, and most of the grounds keepers are local
residents. Without their help, Davidson would be strapped for services.
. Last week, Patricia Cornwell again added herself to the college’s long
list of scholarship donors. It was the second time she had done so in as many
weeks. What the successful author saw in the school was what she had taken
from it: a place of learning and growth. (See page 1.) In essence, she has
made an attempt to give something back to the school that has given so
much to her. -

What these specifics show may be the essence of Davidson College’s
relationship with the outside world. On an idealistic level, the college
molds men and women who can make a difference, people who can adhere
to the lofty standards learned during their careers here. On a realistic level,
Davidson provides its students with the skills to make a difference in their
communities.

Unfortunately, we sometimes forget that. Issues such as a new Union
and the alcohol policy take precedence over the needs of the community in
which we live. Though these issues are important to what we learn here at
Davidson and effect the experiences of future students, they tend to
overshadow the bigger picture. Davidson students are part of a global and
local community.

What we need to remember is that we are being provided with an
invaluable opportunity. We are being given the skills and education to
make a difference. As future lawyers, doctors, politicians, business men,
and teachers, Davidson students will give to their communities. In fact, this
could be the purpose of oureducation. But, we can also give now. The town
of Davidson is our home and that means it is our responsibility to make it
an even better place to live. This responsibility calls for action. Hopefully
we can remember the actions of people like Ada Jenkins and Patricia
Cornwell and use them as inspiration to give back to the community.

Diversity and Free Speech Incompatible?

To the editors,

With dismay and shock
we read the minutes of the
March30SGA meeting. The
proposal, discussed by SGA
president Alden Smith, to
“add an essay question that
addresses issues such as
open-mindedness and inclu-
siveness to the application
for admission to Davidson”
aptly demonstrates the dan-
ger of such reactionary and
radical sentiments which in
recent weeks have graced the
pages of The Davidsonian
and have empowered God
knows whom with those
double-edged words such as
“inclusiveness” and “open-
mindedness.”

The implications of
such a question on our appli-
cation are paramount.

If an applicant answers
such a question with hon-
esty, will his beliefs shatter
his chances of admission? If
an applicant is not open-
minded, would he be weeded
out of the applicant pool in
favor of one who writes posi-
tively about such trite eu-
phemisms as “diversity?”

Will the Davidson ad-
missions office, at the urg-
ing of those in the SGA, be-
come thought-police, admit-
ting only those applicants
who express whichever idce-
ology is currently en vogue
oncampus? Willapplicants,
having doubtlessly read
about the rise of Political
Correctness on American
campuses, lie about their
feelings and beliefs in order
to gain admission into

Davidson College? |. Is it
ironic that those who espouse
the virtues of “inclusiveness”
want to exclude those who
do not?

We urge those people
who will attempt to mold the
beliefs of future Davidson
students to consider seri-
ously the implications of
your “fix-it-all” actions.

At worst, your awk-
ward, hyper-sensitive ques-
tion will filter the applicant
pool, blocking admission of
those applicants who fail to
sce meritin “inclusiveness.”
At best, those who value the
freedoms of speech and
thought will know not to
apply.

With Concern,

Figlio'Impressed with Campus Attitudes

To the editors,

The last time I wrote
The Davidsonian, 1 was
pissed off. Ihad spent hours
running-all-around-campus
putting up flyers for FLAG
only to have most of them
taken down before I was
done. I complained that
Davidson was a conserva-
tive backwater, that most
Davidson students seemed
to want to keep it that way,
that the tewntieth century
had passed us by. I saida lot
of harsh things last spring,
all of which I meant at the
time, andall of which would
now like to take back.

Two weeks ago FLAG
held its second annual fo-
rum. Two men and three
women, one of them a cur-

rent Davidson student spoke
on their experiences and
hardships on being gay or
lesbian in an uncompromis-
ing-world.-Several- hundred
people came to hear them
speak. Their show of under-
standing was overwhelming.
Idon’tthink Ihave ever been
this proud of my alma mater.
Other leading “liberal arts”
colleges make Davidson
look like Bush-Quayle Land.
But who cares? Time after
time, the FLAG forum be-
ing themostrecentexample,
Davidson has demonstrated
an underlying capacity for
acceptance and understand-
ing. No, we are not a cam-
pus of activists. Maybe we
should be. Maybe we don’t
behave enough like students

of the sixties. Maybe the
Causes just don’t seem im-
portant enough.

When the open-minded are
silent, the only ones making
noise are the backwards and
the narrow. To‘ be open-
minded students, to be good
Christians, we don’t have to
advocate; we just have to
accept. Last year, I didn’t
think Davidson was capable
of that. Once again, I would
like to apologize to my col-
lege for my comments last
year. Davidson may not be
the shining star of my brand
of liberalism, but liberal or
conservative, no one can
rightly accuse Davidson of
being backwards.

Sincerely,
Rick Figlio

To the editors,

The world we live in is
a dangerous place. One
needs only turn on the
evening news to be greeted
with that reality. Terrorism,
drug-related violence, sexual

‘| crime— all of these are fre-

quentoccurences and adaily
fear for too many people.
With suffering and threat so
common, it is all too easy to
become numb to their pres-
ence and desire safe havens
where one can escape these
horrors. Often times the in-

rates are available upon request. Copyright is held by the Trustees of Davidson College.

sulated, idealistic world of a

college campus can seem to
be just such a haven, an es-
cape into aclose community
of supreme ideals, great
thoughts, andcodes of honor.

The unfortunate reality
is that no such safe havens
exist. Whether we like to
believe itornot,collegecam-
puses— the Davidson Col-
lege campus among them—
are not islands. The high
ideals and standards of con-

duct that make them good —

places for learning also of-
ten make them good places
for crime, especially sexual

crime. Here at Davidson
College, the highly empha-
sized Honor Code and the
casual habits it engenders
make it all too easy to slip
into the false complacency
that everyone is bound by
similar standards of conduct
and that nothing bad can ever
happen. The Davidson Col-
lege community must rec-

-ognize the reality of the dan-

gers whichit faces. Although
we live in a small town, the
college is not unknown and
