THE DAVIDSONIAN

Page Three

Question

of the Week

“What should Davidson’s future
athletic policy be,-especially with
regard to féotball?”

During the year there has been
much talk by students and others
connected with the college concern-

ing the possibility of a change in
athletic
appear to be four alternatives:

ed

Davidson's policy

subsidization for athletics; sec-
ond, to adopt an open subsidization
as a policy such as Pitt and some
other schools have done; third, to
drop out of a conference in which
there are schools which have direct
subsidization and which invariably
beat in football;
fourth, to drop football from our
intercollegiate schedule. All of these
methods have been tried by several

Davidson and

schools, each has its own particular
advantages and disadvantages. Be-

because of various con-

nections with the school who do fot

because of* finances. If there weré

some way to help deserving athletes
such it would
help the teams, while not hurting
school spirit such as hired athletes
would.”

Bill Hickman, Senior:

“T think that Davidson should do
other athlet-

ics, but do this carefully so as to

as these, I believe

as schools—subsidize

ranking.”

Rea Tenney, Junior:

“T think that’ Davidson should
drop out of the ‘Five’ and into a
smaller conference made up of

teams such as Sewanee and Florida
in the

preserve high standing
both in scholarship and athletics.”

“Under the present policy of
wholesale subsidization practiced by
most colleges Davidson cannot hope

Karl Jonas, Sophomore:
“Considering the calibre of com-
petition that Davidson meets and
the open subsidization of her op-
ponents, I believe that Davidson
should also go in for it in a modi-
fied their athletes

high standards established here.”

way choosing

Chase Brenizer, Sophomore:

“Davidson every year has some
very good talent from its student
body, but being a small college we
cannot possibly. get a team from
this source that will be comparable
to those of larger schools and uni-
versities. Since practically all schools
do subsidize their players and since
we ourselves do that to a limited
extent, I believe that Davidson
should continue her present policy
of limited subsidization. As to com-
peting with larger schools, I think
that Duke and Carolina might be
left off our schedule; plenty of good
teams of strength could still
be on the schedule.”

Jack Abernathy, Junior:

Of course no single student could
attempt to formulate an _ athletic
policy for Davidson, but it is my
honest belief that Davidson has two
alternatives: either open subsidiza-
tion as practiced by other South-
ern Conference members, or ath-

our

letic competition with schools of our
size. Definitely the present
system of playing “the Big Four”
cannot continue on its present basis,
and on the surface at least, it would
seem that to play smaller schools
with no “reputation” will mean prac-
tical financial ruin. Personally, I
still believe that, rather than pro-
fessionalize athletics any further,
Davidson should attempt a reform
movement.

Toni Casali, Junior:

A losing football team hurts a
college in many ways, and certainly
if Davidson expects to play the out-
standing teams that dominate their
schedule they will have to do some-
thing quick to have a winning elev-
en. The only way seems to be thru’
subsidization. Other schools are do-
ing it—Wake Forest, N. C. State,
and even Appalachian—so why not
Davidson. Of course it would be
nice if the subsidized players could
be not only football stars, but also
good students/and the *type men
that Davidson wants.

Three Divisions Discussed

The content of the sermon, as out-

on three divisions. The first point,
what God said about the miracle of
faith, was illustrated by three in-
stances from the Bible: The pic-
ture of birth—which showed that
God is the responsibile person with
whom ‘we must become right;
The picture of the blind man re-
ceiving his sight—which showed
physical and spiritual awakening;
and the picture of resurrection from
death unto life, of which God is
the only one capable of doing.
