The volleyball team had a dif-
ficult time Saturday in its final two
matches of the regular season, drop-
ping both.

VOLLEYBALL

In the morning, the Wildcats
fell to Marshall 15-6, 15-9, 15-5.
Also defeating the Wildcats was
James Madison in a tight five-set
match, marking the last regular-
season match for Wildcats senior
Michele Augustin.

Against Marshall, Davidson
showed signs of their progress
made during the year, but the Wild-
cats lacked consistency. Marshall
stormed out to an 8-3 lead in the
first set and cruised to 1-0 set lead.
Despite taking a 6-3 lead in the
second set, the Wildcats could not
take control.

The Fighting Herd, led by se-
nior outside hitter Jessica Braga
from Brazil, went on"in eight-point
run and took a 2-0 set lead. The
tired Wildcats could not overcome
a9-0 deficit in the third set, leading
to the Marshall rout.

The first two sets against the
Dukes were much the same
for Davidson. The Wildcats fell
behind early in each set, losing 15-
8 and 15-6. Looking like a James
Madison rout, Davidson coach Lisa
Radford urged her team to lighten
up and have fun.

“After that second set, I told

the team a joke ... It was getting
way too heavy out there,” Radford
said.

The Wildcats responded. Led
by Augustin’s spirited effort,
Davidson won the next two sets
15-10, 15-8. But in the end, the
experienced James Madison club
was too tough for the young Wild-
cats as the Dukes captured the
match with a 15-7 fifth set win.

Augustin was honored before
the James Madison match. The
Wildcats captain has been a sig-
nificant player on the Wildcats’
squad for four years, winning
Freshman of the Year honors in
1992 and consistently leading in
the Southern Conference in sev-
eral categories. Her versatility and
leadership made her very valuable
to Davidson over her career.

“She has been the most versa-
tile player I have ever worked with

... She is truly a leader. When she.

is up, the team is up,” Radford
said.

With a full week to practice,
the Wildcats look to do well in the
Southern Conference tournament
at Belk Arena this weekend. The
Wildcats have made great improve-
ments this season, and Radford
and the squad obviously hopes that
they are demonstrated next week-
end.

Neither Davidson’s. seed nor
opponent has been determined yet,
but whomever the Wildcats face,
Radford feels confident.

“T feel our team can play with
anybody in the league,” she said.

First-round matches will be
held Friday, and the tournament
will continue Saturday before
Sunday’s final at 2 p.m.

Southern Conference
could add three schools

Associated Press

CHARLESTON, SC—The
Southern Conference could soon
be adding three new schools.

The current presidents of the
conference, which includes
Davidson, recently voted to invite
UNC Greensboro, College of
Charleston and Wofford to join the
league.

“Tt was aunanimous decision,”
Claudius Watts, president of The
Citadel, told The (Charleston, SC)
Post and Courier. Watts also said
the presidents voted at the league’s
annual winter meetings to amend
the conference’s constitution to
allow schools that do not play Di-
vision I football to join the confer-
ence.

Davidson is currently the only
school in the conference not to
play a Southern Conference sched-
ule. The Wildcats are classified in
Division I-AA for football, but play
a Division III schedule.

The College of Charleston
does not have a football team, and
the school’s president, Alex Sand-

ers, said he doubted the college
would create a team soon.

“T understand we have been
considered for (Southern Confer-
ence) membership,” Sanders said.
“However, under the league’s by-
laws, I don’t think we’ re eligible to
become members because we don’t
have a football team. If it takes a
football team to become a member
of the Southern Conference, we
will never become members.”

The Charleston newspaper
also reported that the presidents
voted to extend the invitations next
month and ask the new schools to
begin competing in the 1998-99
season.

The conference formed a five-
member committee to conduct on-
campus visits to the three schools.
The group will be headed by assis-
tant commissioner Geoff Cabe and
will hold the visits in the next few
weeks.

“It’s not a done deal,” said
College of Charleston athletic di-
rector Jerry Baker. “We have not
been extended an official invita-
tion, but we have talked with the

Southern Conference about join-
ing the league.”

The College of Charleston is
currently in the Trans America
Athletic Conference and was re-
cently selected to host the
conference’s basketball tourna-
ment in 1997 and ‘98.

The school’s basketball coach,
John Kresse, said the college would
have to look seriously at any invi-

‘tation.

“The Southern Conference has
a great tradition,” he said. “There
would be a lot of natural rivalries
for all our teams.”

UNC Greensboro is likely to
leave the Big South Conference
soon, and Wofford, which is lo-
cated in Spartanburg, SC, remains
an independent.

Other Southern Conference
members are: The Citadel, Ten-
nessee-Chattanooga, Furman,
Georgia Southern, Appalachian
State, Western Carolina, Virginia
Military Institute, Marshall and
East Tennessee State.

Marshall will leave the con-
ference in 1997.
