‘Slumping Defense’ Plas gues ° Wildcats

By CHARLIE SLAGLE
Staff Writer

Davidson basketball coach Bo
Brickels feels that his players
need to ‘concentrate defen-
sively” if they are going to get
out of this slump which has
resulted in losses 11 out of the
last 12 appearances.

This non-concentration was
evident in Davidson’s last two
losses. The first came to the tall
and talented) Gamecocks of
Sough Carolina 85-68, while the
other was to the smal] but quick
East Carolina Pirates 110-78.

The East Carolina loss was
the worst in Johnston Gym sin-
ce 1955 when Duke beat the Cats
107-75.

The loss was also the only the
third defeat in the last 75 games
on Davidson’s home court.

Davidson has thus far this
year not controlled the pace of
many games. Brickels com-
mented that ‘‘we are doing
whatever people want us to do,
we have to our own thing.”

The coach pointed out that the
Cats have let Virginia control
the tempo and score 58 points
and then let E.C.U..control the
tempo and score 110. Brickels
says that there has to be
someplace in between where
Davidson can control the game.

a

Davidson did a good job in the
first half of the South Carolina
game in controlling the tempo
of that game. Davidson played
a 2-1-2 zone and despite.poor
shooting, were only behind five
points at halftime to the
nationally ranked Gamecocks.

In the second half, South
Carolina started quickly and
pulled Davidson out of their
zone and from then on it was all
South Carolina as' they built up
leads as big as 20 points.

The margin of victory for the
Gamecocks was 17. Leading
South Carolina’s second half
charge were center Tom
Boswell and guard Mike
Dunleavy. Boswell and
Dunleavy finished the game
with 22 and 18 points respec-
tively.

Davidson was led by its two
Youngstown players, Greg
Dunn and Jay. Powell. Powell
shot well from very long range
and ended his 18 points on
drives and short jumpers. off
drives.

Part of Brickels overall
defensive plan which the Cats
have not done well this year is
“to take away from a player
what he does best.” This. was
definitely missing in the East
Carolina game.

Davidson allowed East
Carolina to run up and down the
floor at will. The Pirates got hot
and did not miss.

The big men for East
Carolina were Dennie Owens
Greg Ashorn and Bucky Baum.

These three players coming
into the game were averaging
less than 23 points a game but in
this one they scored 79.

Owens had 30 on 15 for 16 from
the floor, Ashurn had 26 and
Buman who was a substitute
had 23. All coach Brickels could
say is that ‘‘we let them get
started.”

East Carolina shot 62 percent
from the floor in the game and
at one stretch only missed three
shots out of 27.

Dunn, Powell and Kevin
Doherty were the only Wildcats
in double figures in the game.

Davidson now finds itself 0-3
in the Southern Conference with
only seven games left. It is very
important for Davidson to be in
the top four in the conference
this year.

__ The first four tLams will host —
the first round games in. the

Southern Conference Tour-
nament on March Ist.

Brickels feels that the Cats
will have to win 6 of their last
seven to get in the top four. He
did add that if they were at .500
they might be able to do it but it
would be a long shot.

Winning all these games will
certainly not be easy, as David-
son has to play Furman twice
and East Carolina away in
those seven games.

Davidson’s next two games
will be against conference op-
ponents. The first will be
tomorrow at 2 p.m. against
Citadel at Johnston Gym. The
Citadel will be led by guard
Rodney McKewen who Brickels
calls a “‘great talent.’’

- McKeever is averaging 24
points a garne this year.
Then, Monday night the Cats

-will travel to Greenville to play

last year’s conference cham-
pion Furman. Furman is a
rugged team and is led by
Moose Leonard and Clyde
Mayes who are both demons on
the boards.

Brickels will be looking for
defensive efforts similar to the
St. John’s game against those —
two teams.

Brickels felt that the St.

John’s game was the closest
thing that he has seen this year
to the type of defense Davidson
should be playing.
