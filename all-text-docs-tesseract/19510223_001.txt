Royal Chaplain

To Give Lectures

The 58-year-old Otts Lecture
Series at Davidson College be-
ginning Sunday night features
this year five addresses by Dr.
James Hutchison Cockburn,
outstanding Scottish minister
and theologian.

The former moderator of the
Chureh of Scotland will speak

on ‘‘The Church and State in
Europe” during Feb. 25-28.
Emile Calliet, French Scholar,

J. H. COCKBURN

delivered the tenth and most re-
cent lectures in the series in 1946.
Other recent speakers have been
Dr. John R. Mott in 1940 and Dr.
John A. Mackay in 1942. The se.
ries was opened in 1893 by Dr.
J. M. P. Otts.

The 1951 speaker was invited
partially because of his world-wide
experience.in Christian service. Un-
til recently he was director of the
department of Reconstruction and
Inter-Church Aid of the World
Council of Churches and his du-
ties took him to eighteen countries
in Europe, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand.

Dr. Cockburn, (pronounced “Co.
burn”) who is also chaplain to
King George VI, will arrive in
America this month, and plans to
travel through the South, Eastern
Seaboard and Mid-West. He has
visited America before, receiving
the honorary degree of Doctor of
Divinity from Yale University in
1948.

Dr. Cockburn spent four months
in America last winten filling a
speaking schedule which covered
the country from the East Coast
to the West Coast. He spent three
weeks in Florida as a leader on the
Chain of Missionary Assemblies and
Jed preaching missions in Lynch-
burg, Virginia and Hagerstown,
Maryland. He also delivered le¢-
tures at a good many colleges and
seminaries. .

The trip which brings Dr. Cock.
burn to Davidson will carry him
also to other points in the South,
Mid-West and the Eastern Sea-
board. He will be in the United
States from mid-February until
mid-May.

Dr. Cockburn’s warmth of man.
ner and genial personality, as well
as his striking presence and dis-
tinction as a speaker, have made
him a welcome guest in whatever
part of the world he has visited.
Few men would have better right
to be called “Ambassador of Good-
will.”

NATIONAL FRAT

Sigma Upsilon, Davidson's “ha-
tional honorary fraternity recog-
nizing student literary talent, held
its regular meeting last Thursday
evening at nine fifteen in the Phi
Gam house. Don Shriver pre-
sided over the meeting, guiding the
main discussion, which dealt with
the issue of whether the Davidson
chapter should rejoin the national
organization of Sigma Upsilon. The
chapter received its original charter
as a member of the national frater-
nity, but when the parent organi-

Student Council
Cracks Gambling

Next Tuesday, February 27,
the student body will meet to
discuss a proposed amendment
to the Constitution of the Stu-
dent Body with respect to
gambling. Because of compli-
cations in dealing with a re.
cent case of gambling on the
campus, the Student Council
has acted in proposing an
amendment to the constitution.
A special committee of Stu-
dent Council members, ’ com.
posed of Ray Cunningham,
Ken Goodpasture, and Larry
Dagenhart, have met and dis-
cussed this matter, and their
proposal will be ‘presented to
the student body next Tues-
day. As the constitution now
stands on gambling: Article
VIII, Student Body Regula.
tions, Section Three, “No stu-
dent shalt be guilty of gamb-
lmg."” This can be interpreted
to mean any type of gambling
whatsoever, and in a_ recent
student body meeting, it was
proposed that a group be ap.

-|STUDENTS HAVE

CHANCE TO AID
MEN IN KOREA

The American Red Cross will
conduct a Blood Drive in Davidson
Community on Friday, March 9th,
between the hours of 11 a. m. and
5 p. m. Place: Basement of David.
son College Infirmary. This is the
second such drive conducted in the
last few months, the other having
been October 26th. The March
Drive is particularly important be-
cause of the large number of casual-
ties sustained recently in the in.
tense fighting in Korea. A greatly
increased blood quota has been as-
signed Mecklenburg County for
this particular reason. It has been
indicated that there is a_ critical
shortage of blood for the fighting
forces especially.

It is planned to-cail upon the
Student Body, all Civic groups of
the town, individual citizens and
college personnel for support. The
national college leadership frater-
nity, Omicron Delta Kappa, in.
tends to give active encouragement
to the Student Body’s participation.

Those persons who desire to don-
ate blood will be given a .conven.
Solicitors
will have appointment blanks with
them at the time of their calls. Ap-
pointments may also be made dir-
ectly with the ROTC office at the
College, phone 2791, between the
hours of 8 a. m. and 5 p. m. It is
intended that, by close. adherence

P.C.,,GM.C. Victims
Of ROTC Rifle Team

The Wildcat Rifle Team defeated
Presbyterian College and Gordon
Military College in a postal match
this week. Scores were: Davidson,
1868; Gordon Military College,
1858; and Presbyterian College,
1800. Ten men fired for each team,
the high 5 scores counting. Possible
team score was 2000. High scorer
for the Wildcats was W. W. Ab-
bott with 379 out of 400. The other
four students who placed were, in
order of score: A. S. Miree, F.
McCutchan, J. P. Thompson, and
W. L. Morris.

The victories gave the local team
a seasons record of 15 matches won
and 4 lost. Two postal matches re-
main on the schedule, both to be
fired at an early date: with St.
Thomas College and a return match
with Gordon Military College. Three
slioulder-to-shoulder matches also
remain on the schedule, as follows:
VMI, at Lexington, on 3 March:
Clemson, at Clemson, on 10 March
and Wofford, at Spartanburg, on
16 March.

The scheduled shoulder-to-shoul.
der match here with Wofford Sat.
urday afternoon has been cancelled,
due to the fact that the Wildcats
will be firing an invitational match

in Charlotte on that date.

Last night, Chamber's audi-
torium echoed ‘with fine tones
of the dulcimer and the male
alto voice of John Jacob Niles,

the world renowned ballad
singer.

The program he offered was
composed of many different
types of ballads. He asked the
audience never to forget that
a ballad is a song that tells a
story. Before he sang each ballad
he related the history and origin
of each. Most of the ballads he used
were either of English or local
origin, although even the text of
many local ballads was English.
Some of the better known ballads
he rendered were “I Wonder as I
Wander,” “Barbara Allen,” “John
Henry,” “The Sea Witch,” “The
Black Jack Gypsy,” and many other
entertaining selections. He also
sang and gave the history of sev-
eral English carrols which are re-
ligious ballads about Mary and
Jesus.

Mr. Niles, who hds sung in Paris,
Mexico City, and many other fa-
mous cities of the world, comes
from a long line of musicians. On
his father’s side, ballad singing
goes back five generations, and
his mother is descendent of a long
line of musical instrument makers.

He started singing ballads when
he was fifteen years old, and he
told the audience, that his voice,

NOTICE

The PMS&T has been in-
formed by Headquarters
Third Army that the annual
formal inspection of the
Military Department will
be conducted by the Gov-
ernment on Monday and
Tuesday, 30 April & 1 May,
respectively. Such an in-
spection is given every
ROTC unit toward the
close of each school year,
and is normally made by
a party of at least 3 offi-
cers, all of whom have the
rank of at least major. Nor-
mally the officer in charge
has the rank of full Col-
onel.

D-Clubbers Still On
Job, Still Plugging

The bays who stay “with the
batl during the athletic year have
been “on the ball” lately in other
activities on the Davidson campus.
The D Club's members Wave been
taking up ducats and ushering .at
all home basketball contests. These
guardians of Davidson's athletic
powers have becn faithfully yuid-
ing the spectators to their respec.
tive seats on the east side of the

a °
J} gyim-and in the balcony.

At the recent Mid-Winter's. dan.
ces the cloak room was under .the
care of the D Club with Bill Lee
directing the exchange of coats,
checks, and change. The conven-
ience offered by this service was one
integral part of the proper func.
tioning of the dances.

A matter of interest to those
members of the student body who
are athletically inclined is the fact
that the letter men have been in-
vestigating the possibilities of a
physical education major here at
Davidson. The club members have
been attempting’ to work out a
plan with the faculty, whereby the
college would’ be able to offer such
a course. The problem of setting
requirements for a physical educa-
tion major is being worked out,
and it is hoped that in the near
future such a course will be possi-
bie.

guests were entertained by pledge
skits referring to Task Week. Bud-

very interesting as it told how
mixed dancing was once forbidden
at Davidson,

Most of the other fraternities
held open hodse during the weekend
to furnish a place to go relax and
cat.

The. second annual Miami Triad
Banquet was held in the college
