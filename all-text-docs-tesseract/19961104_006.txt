Prediction from PoliSci Professor Susan Roberts and her crystal ball

Turnout = 49.7

Clinton over Dole with Clinton winning FLA, AZ, NC, CA

52% Clinton
42% Dole
6% Perot

£

GOP will retain control of Senate, losing one seat with total 52 GOP- 8 Dem

Helms will win over GANTT

Bruggere(d) will win over Smith(r) in open seat in OR
Johnson (d) will win over Pressler (incumbent -r) in SD

Governor Hunt re-elected over challenger Robin Hayes in NC

In House races, Democrats need to pick up 19 to gain control of Hous, and they
will do just that (maybe even 20 seat gain)

Senate Races

If the presidential race seems
boring, then look no further than
the Senate races. Several races
— particularly in the South —
are hotly contested. -

North Carolina

Jesse Helms and Harvey Gantt
are running a close race. They
ran it six years ago, but many
argue that the demographics of
the state have changed since
then, with almost 700,000
people moving into the state.
Gantt is the former mayor of
Charlotte, and Senator Helms
is head of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.

Alabama

No clear favorite. Republicand
thought they could easily pick
up Alabama, but the candidate,
Attorney General Jeff Sessions,
has not run a strong enough
campaign to be sure. State Sena-
tor Roger Bedford is the Demo-
cratic nominee. They are run-
ning to fill Democratic Senator
Howell Heflin’s seat.

Arkansas

No clear favorite. Republican
Representative Tim Hutchinson
and Democratic state Attorney
General Winston Bryant are
running neck in neck. The race
seemed likely to go to Republi-
can Mike Huckabee, but he had
to replace Governor Jim Guy
Tucker, who resigned as a re-
sult of the Whitewater scandal.

Georgia

No clear favorite. Democratic
nominee and former Georgia
Secretary of State Max Cleland
is running a close race with
Republican and _ former

Gubenatorial candidate Guy

Millner. Cleland, a Vietnam
war hero, is a triple amputee in
a wheelchair.

Kentucky
No clear favorite. Incumbent

‘Republican Mitch McConnell

is fighting his third difficultrace
against former Lt. Governor
Democrat Steven Beshear.

Louisiana

No clear favorite. Republican
State Rep. Loius “Woody”
Jenkins is running against
Democratic Former State Trea-
surer Mary L. Landrieu. They
are running to fill the seat va-
cated by retiring Democratic
Senator J. Bennett Johnston.

Mississippi

Likely Republican. Thad
Cochran, Republican Confer-
ence chairman is considered an
easy win for his fourth Senate
term. His opponent is little-
known retired farmer James W.
“Bootie” Hunt.

New Jersey

No clear favorite. Democratic
Representative Robert G.
Torricelli, the most wellfunded
congressional candidate in the

publican Representative Dick
Zimmer.

South Carolina -

Old favorite Republican Strom
Thurmond, age 93, seems likely
to win. If he does get elected to
a seventh term, he will have the
longest record of Senate ser-
vice ever six months into his
term. Democratic challenger
Elliott Close wants South Caro-
linians to “send him home,” but

it doesn’t seem to be working. :

Tennessee

Republican likely. Incumbent
Fred Thompson seems to have
few negative ratings, and chal-
lenger attorney Houston Gor-
don is not well known.

Texas

Republican likely. Senator and
‘Republican Primary candidate
Phil Gramm will most likely
crush opponent Victor Morales.
Morales, a hispanic school-
teacher, was once a promising
candidate but his inexperience
has proven to be a liability.

West Virginia

Democratic safe. John D.
Rockefeller IV is a legend to
West Virginians, and is a shoo-
in for the race. Republican op-
ponent, Nurse Betty A. Burks,
is not campaigning and said that
she is running to make sure the
GOP ballot line was filled.

Japan's LDP unable to form a coalition

Political experts believe that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party will be unable to form a
coalition to attain majority status in Japan's lower house of Parliament.
The LDP has held power in Japan from the second world war until
1993. In the October 20 elections, the LDP won 239 of 500 lower
house seats and is now apparently stalled in non-majority status.
Japan's smaller parties are rejecting the LDP's offers of forming a
coalition in fear of begin dominated by the LDP's near-majority
number of seats.

Mexican kidnappings rise, frighten international investors
A surge in Mexican kidnappings has aroused fear in international
investors. Mexican officials cite several reasons for the increase in
kidnapping cases, most of which do not appear to be politically
motivated. Officials say drug traffickers, leftist guerrilla groups, and
the near-devastation of Mexico's economy two years ago are to blame.

Air raids in Afghanistan capital kill three children

Three children were killed in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, last

amonth ago and immediately began to convert the city to strict Islamic
law. Women are no longer allowed to work, and girls are no longer
