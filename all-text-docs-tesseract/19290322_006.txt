ATHLETES HONORED

*(Continued from page 1)

“That torth’ is “none” orftér than” your
coveted ‘D’'—Be it yours, then, to hold
it high” were Captain Pritchett's clos-
ing words.

As a token of recognition for what they
had done for Davidson, and as a symbol of
appreciation of the student body, Pro-
fessor Fleagle presented gold footballs to
the following 1928 letter men: Thad
Brock, Barium Springs; Warren David,
Wilmington; W. N. Middleton, Mobile,
Ala.; Captain A. W. Baker, Stony Point;
D. O. Leftwich, Conyers, Ga.; W. C.
Archie, Salisbury ; Sam Smith, Charlotte ;
Captain-elect H. Y. Harper, Oak Hill,
Ala.; A. L. DeCamp, Boonton, N. J.;
Riggs McConnell, Davidson; Walter
Fraley, Barium Springs; Dick Flinn, Jr.;
Atlanta, Ga.; R. E. Kell, Pascagoula,
Miss,; T. W. Brohard, Grafton, W. Va.;
Sam Black, Davidson; C. H. Mauzy,,Jr.,
manager, Harrisonburg, Va.; J. T. Kerr,
Wilmington; J. R. Covington, Raeford.
Football certificates were presented -by
Dr. J. M. Douglas to the same above-
named men,

Dr. Hood awarded certificates to the
following Wildcats for basketball: R. G.
Calhoun, C. R. Pritchett, Dean Rusk, F.
W. Johnson, W. B. Goodson, L. C.
Wadsworth, and M. L. Crawford.

A very amusing but interesting talk
was made by Dr. Arbuckle, in which he
commended the work of Captain Pritchett
as physical director. He emphasized the?
fact that although Davidson's teams have
been somewhat fearfully handicapped
sometimes by physical weight and power,
every member has taken it upon himself
to put up a one hundred per cent fight
all the way through the game. He told
the students that Captain Pritchett had
no easy task before him as ‘physical di-
rector, and that the director had promised
a stronger and better student body. More
than sixty men had been measured up,
at the first of the fall, to participate in
the eontest of physical development which
had been offered by Captain Pritchett.
However, a few weeks later, approximate-
ly thirty men were remeasured, and eight
of these thirty showed a minimum of
six and four-eighths inches in physical
improvement.

Splendid improvement was noted in the
physique of H. L. Carr, Freshman, who
obtained, out of ten measurements taken, a
record of nine and three-eighths inches
in improvement. In recognition of this
he was-presented a silver cup by Dr. Ar-
buckle. A. W. Cowan was next, showing
an improvement of nine inches.

Following this, Colonel Scott and Pro-
fessor Blythe presanted certificates for
tennis and wrestling respectively. Those
who were given tennis certificates in-
cluded the following: F. W. Johnson, J.
T. Roddey, A. N. Haverstadt, R. W.
Carr. For wrestling, certificates were
presented to Captain T. FE. Hill, Thad
Brock, Romney Herriott, W. H. Flythe,
John Christenbury, Alex. Warren, L. H.
Cowan, Charles Marrow. A. N, Myers,
varsity cheer-leader, was also awarded
a certificate.

Professor Currie then made a com-
mendatory speech to the students, using
as his subject, “A Real Wildcat.’ He
defined a “Real” Wildcat as the custodian
of what is called the Davidson Wildcat
spirit. He stated that a’ “Real” Wildcat
is the precious guardian of Davidson.
Three men who were designated Real Da-
vidson Wildcats were Dr. J. M. MeCon-
nell, Professor of History at Davidson,
who has always shown an intense and
never-failing interest in all athletic ac-
tivities; Mr. J. A. Cannon, Concord, N.
C.; who was mentioned as having done
a great deal to safeguard the Wildcat

spirit; and Mr. Joe Johnson, Barium

» Springs, who was a loyal Wildcat on

Davidson's team years ago.

To conclude the exercises, Dr. Oren
Moore, Davidson alumnus, and medical
doctor of Charlotte, introduced Judge
Fred Helms, Charlotte, judge of the
county recorder’s court, who gave an in-
teresting and forceful talk on his personal
views of athletics; how he had noticed

ish parentage. He attended school in

Prof. LaCalle was in the employ of
the United States government in Ma-
nila as translator of Spanish docu-
ments.

He is also an author of note, having
written a number of textbooks for
Spanish students, and numerous ar-
ticles treating with methods of teach-
ing and conducting classes for mag-
azines.

Professor LaCalle will remain on the
campus for several days orienting him-
self with Southern manners and cus-

several of the Spanish classes and will
give talks to these classes in Spanish.

Myers Will Speak
On “Ministry” Wed.

Dr. Charles F. Myers, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church in Greens-

Guidance ‘program with ‘a talk on the
subject of “Ministry.” Dr. Myers will
be on the campus Tuesday and Wed-
nesday and he will conduct a series of
discussion groups with the students
on Wednesday morning.

Dr. Myers conducted a service here
three years ago. He is a minister who
is popular with boys and is well known
throughout the state and Presbytery.

These discussion groups worked very
successfully when Dr. Brenizer was
here. Aubrey Brown is in charge of
these interviews, and all students de-
siring to talk with Mr. Myers through
one of these groups, will see him.

the Davidson football team as being al-

lived up to their example as true Wild-
cats. He mentioned the fact that ath-
letic sportsmanship in . America could
never have reached the point where it is
now, except through influence in Ameri-
can colleges. “People have come to real-
ize that two things have to come together,
a sound mind and a sound body. We
have.come to the point of developing the
brain qualities of sportsmanship. The
spirit dominates in the representatives of
There is a
value of education to the institution and
a value to the individual. We need the
discipline that we get in the training of
athletics,”’ these were some of the inter-
esting facts brought out in his talk.
The singing of “College Ties” marked
the concluding number for the exercises.
