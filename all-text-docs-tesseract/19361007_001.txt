ADDITIONAL PUBLICITY

Designer of School Seal Be- |:
lieved Marshal Ney

— Peter Stuart Ney, designer of the
Davidson College seal, who pre-
pared young men for Davidson in
the 1840's, and used the college li-
brary, was once more dragged into
the ‘limelight this summer by en-
thusiasts in Charlotte, N.C. Again
an altempt is on foot to prove once
and for all that Peter Stuart Ney
was Napoleon's great general, the
Marshal of France, Michel Ney.
Marshal Ney was supposed to have
been executed before a firing squad
of his own troops by order of a
court martial, December 7 1815.
Early the next month an un-

known Frenchman, calling himseli
Peter Stuart Ney, landed at Char-
leston. S. CC. He finally settled

“down in Iredell county where he

execution.

taught school. A number of in-
stances during his tife led many to
believe he was the famous Mar-
shal, and on his deathbed he made
a statement to taat erfect.
Davidson has in its library one
of the most important pieces of evi-
dence’ in this aifair, a book in
which Ney drew a sketch of him-
self and wrote a number of remarks
in French.. This is on display in
the_College Library, with the 1927
Quips and Cranks, which used Ney
for'its theme, and a book about the
historic doubts as to Marshal Ney's
Mr. Allison, of Char-
lotte, has promised to lend the li-
brary for its display. the plaster
cast, mentioned in the article fron”
Time, which is also in the case. ,
The seal was designed. by Ney
in 1840, at the request of a commit-
tee, and has been pronounced. by
numismatists to be one of the finest
in the country. The motto is un-
derstood to be a reference to the
Mecklenburg movement for [Inde-.
pendence, and reads, “Let light be

— cherished where liberty has arisen.”

that is choosing the plays.

Because of the large group of
freshmen turning out for dramatics
one of the plays will be entirely in
the hands of the new men. Eager-
ness and willingness to work on the
part of the freshmen is expected to
develop quite a few competent ac-
tors

It was announced that plans are
under way to make possible sev-
era] full-length, three-act dramas
to be presented at intervals during
the coming season. More definite
information on this will be given
out when the casting directors have
a chance to look over-thetirew men
and see what talent is available.
The dates and names of these plays,
however, will not be announced un-
til some later time.

‘Last year the Masquers produced
two three-act plays which were
highly praised by critics and equally
successiul shows are expected this
year. “Three-Cornered Moon" and
“The Queen's Husband” were
among last season's outstanding
successes.

SUDDEN BLAST

—___.

The home of Mrs. Hengeveld, our
registrar's wife, was the scene of a
terrific explosion Saturday morn-
ing. -An old laundry stove “being
used t6 heaf the kitchen this par-
ticular morning was the cause of
the accident. Some water left in
the jacket of the heater turned to
steam and blew the stove to bits.
The shock of the explosion shook
plaster from the ceiling, blew two
doors completely from their hinges
andawrecked all the kitchen furni-
ture Fortunately, né one was in
the room when the explosion oc-
curred,

Five minutes before the blast,
Mrs. Hengeveld was seated a few
feet from the stove. Luckily she
went out of the room and shut,the
door, for a few minutes later—af-
ter the explosion—the frame of the
chatr upon which she had been sit-
ting was hanging on a p:ece of the
stove-.driven—so deeply into the
wall that it took two men to tear

it out. Whewltll!
Said Mrs. Hengewveld, obviously
an optimist, after the accident

which had completely weecked her
kitchen, “Well, I've. wanted a new
kitchen for a long time; now: I'll
get one.”
