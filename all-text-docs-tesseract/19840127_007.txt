Love Tractor Harvests Psychedelic Porch Funk

By TITO FINCH
and JOE JAWORSKI

Love Tractor, a relatively new band
from Athens, Georgia played F & M
Monday night. Along with opening act
Other Bright Colors (catch ‘em at the
Milestone tonight), they put on a show
that kept the house rocking until! past the
time your mom retires on weeknights.

The band plays a novel brand of lis-
tenable and danceable guitar pop that
guitarist and vocalist Mark Cline calls
“psychedelic porch funk.” The band was
sympathetic to our entreaties for an inter-
view, Since they were waiting for a sound
check. They had nothing better to do, so
they gave us a chance to talk with the
band.

Mark began the interview by inform-
ing us that he is a Leo, bom in the Leo-
Virgo cusp with Gemini rising, and that
he gets his hair cut by an Italian barber on
Ist and 76th streets in New York (Joe
wanted to know this). The conversation
which followed these inanities is as fol-
lows:

Tito: Just to get started, could you iden-
tify all the members of the band for us?
Mark: Sure. 'm Mark Cline, on guitar,
bass, and vocals. Armistead Wellford is
the bassist, and he also plays the clarinet
and sings. Michael Richmond plays
guitar and sings, and the drummer An-
drew Bierne Carter. Woody Noss is our
sound man.

Joe: Where did you get the name “Love
Tractor’?

Mark: I] don’t know, it just came natur-
ally to us, I guess. A lot of people try to
put meaning into it. When we were play-
ing at Brown, a girl came up to us and
told us that it was the grossest name for a
vagina that she had ever heard. That’s
crazy. It doesn’t mean anything.

Tito: Where did you get the idea to do a
song called “Fat Birds?”

Mark: Well, after R.E.M.’s “Wolves,
Lower’ came out, we decided to spoof it.
We were just screwing around and came
up with a song called “Birds, Lower.”
The joke was aimed at [R.E.M. bassist]
Bill Berry, and he would have gotten it,
but everyone else would have thought
that we were ripping them off or putting
them down, so we changed it to “Fat
Birds, Lower,” and then just “Fat Birds.”
Joe: Do you travel with just five people?
How do you support yourself?

Mark: Yeah, just us five. Sometimes
someone from the record company [dB
Records] will come with us, but not
often. We're completely subsidized by
our music, both gigs and sales.

Tito: What’s your opinion of the PWTB
Syndrome? You know, that crowd that
gets a charge out of “partyin’ with the
band” backstage.

Mark: Those guys’re really weird.
[Laughs.] Really, we don't get into those
kinda people. We love to drink a few

beers and have a good time, | mean,
we're normal guys, but there are so many
people out there who want to hang out
with us just because we're in a band, and
not because we're nice guys. It gets
kinda old. I mean, you wouldn't believe
how many “best friends” musicians
have. I’ve had at least five different girls
tell me that they're Bill Berry’s best
friend. [Interview stops while everyone
laughs at everyone else’s favorite PWTB
stories.]

Joe and Tito: Would anyone else like to
say anything?

Armistead: Hi.

Joe: What do you think about the “musi-
cal hierarchy”?

Mark: There’s a lot of guys on the
periphery of our thing who try to tell us
which direction our music should take,
and that bothers us. Otherwise, we
realize that all the production and man-
agement and executive-level crap is nec-
essary, and we've learned to live with it.
Tito: What's your favorite kind of place
to play?

Mark: We really like playing small par-
ties like this, We're looser on stage, and
that makes for a better sound. Also, I like
to be able to see the crowd dancing and
having fun.

Joe: At what point did you make the
“crisis decision” to keep the band to-
gether? How hard was it?

Mark: Actually it was a pretty simple de- ~
cision. P'm an art.major, and I don’t want
to be a graphic designer right now. You
just reach a certain point in your music
when everything is really clicking, and
you don’t want to stop.

Tito: Did you go to the University |of
Georgia]?

Mark: Yeah, all of us except Andrew.
We still live there. Athens is a really
great place to live. It's got a really super
music community. Everyone is really
supportive. I€s really cheap to live there,
too, with the students there and all.
