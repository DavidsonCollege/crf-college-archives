It was announced Thursday
evening that Edward L. Palmer,
chairman of the psychology de-
partment, is the recipient of anew
endowed professorship.

The announcement of Palmer
as the first holder of the Wayne M.
and Carolyn A. Watson professor-
ship was made Thursday night
during the annual meeting of the
Board of Visitors. The focus of the
meeting was a “Professorship
Celebration” to. highlight the im-

portance to the college of its 128 .

full-time faculty members, and of
the named professorships which
20 of them hold.

Wayne Watson is a Life
Member of the Board of Visitors.
The Watson’s daughter, Bryna,
graduated from Davidson in 1982
“magnacum laude” with honors in
psychology, and is now involved
with social work in Kansas.

The Watson gift will count
toward the $150 million goal of the
Campaign for Davidson, a five-
year fundraising effort that seeks
todouble thecollege’s endowment,
build new facilities and raise $40
million forendowed professorships
and other faculty programs.

Palmer, a member of the fac-
ulty since 1970, is spending this
semester at UNC-Chapel Hill
working on a book he has tenta-
tively titled Children’s Pied Piper:
Television Advertising A long-
time student of the effect of televi-
sion on children, Palmer said the
new book willconsider theareas in
childrens’ lives that are most af-

fected by television advertising.
He will emphasize the pre-school
years, when children first become
socialized, and the puberty. and
mid-teen years, when adolescents
become more conscious of how
they look in relation to their peers.
He is author of a 1987 book,
Children in the Cradle of Televi-
sion which chronicles the evolu-
tion of programming since 1950,
when only onein 10 families owned
a television set, to the present.
Wayne and Carolyn Watson

are native Georgians, and have

shared in founding and develop-
ment of The Wayne Watson Co.,a
sales agency and a light manufac-
turing and warehousing business
representing the athletic industry.
In recognition of his exceptional
achievement in salesmanship and
industry leadership, Mr. Watson
was honored with the Hall of Fame
Award given by the Sporting Goods
Athletic Association.

President John Kuykendall
said the college is gratified to re-
ceive such a major gift from par-
ents of a former student. ““We are
deeply grateful for this gift from
the Watsons. Their generosity
reminds us that our care and edu-
cation of students is not only an
important job for the sake of those
students, but that parents are giv-
ing us a sacred trust when they
send their sons and daughters here.
We are happy that Bryna got so
much out of her Davidson experi-
ence and we intend to work hard to
make sure all students feel like-
wise when they graduate.”
