A veritable sea of girls flooded the campus

during the past week-end, as seven of the
eleven fraternities represented on the campus
centered their attention on a post-exam sea- |
festivity. Multi-colored frocks of
delicate and shimmering materials, and new
spring hats to match, vied with each other
in producing a scene of color and beauty.
It seemed as if “Junior Speaking,” with its
usual revelry and casting its

The Wake Forest team defeated the Wild-
catse on Wednesday night by the score of
48 to 36. At the end of the first half the
Wildcats were leading by one point, the
score being 21 to 20, chiefly through the
work of Staley, who scored 14 points in this
half. They were not able to hold the lead
during the second half, as Wake Forest
scored 27 points to 15 for Davidson. Staley
was high point man of the game, getting 16
points during the game. The whole Wake
Forest team shot well, not a man getting less
than eight points to his credit, while two of
them gathered in 11 points. It was due to
the superior: work in the second half that the
Wake Forest team was able to win.
