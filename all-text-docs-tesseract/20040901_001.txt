Davidson keeps
seventh place
national ranking

By BEN WHIGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

U.S. News’ latest collegiate rank-
ing guide reaffirmed Davidson’s sta-
tus as one of the country’s premiere
liberal arts colleges. For the second
straight year, Davidson earned sev-
enth place in the national rankings.

U.S: News ranked Davidson num-
ber one for faculty resources, which
was determined based on factors in-
cluding class-size and the student-
faculty ratio.

“We're seeking quality,” says
Dean of Faculty Clark Ross, “and we
appreciate the fact that it’s recog-
nized.”

Despite its high rank, Davidson
placed 24" in financial resources,
well behind other schools populat-
ing the top ten.

_ “If you really look at the other
schools on that top ten list, the finan-
_cial difference is stark,” says Dean

“of Students Tom Shandley.

First years tire quickly
of orientation activities

By Mary KATHERINE EVANS

Staff Writer

Freshman Orientation smoothly
guided 466 first-year students
through their first week at Davidson,
though some of those students tired
quickly from the continuous activi-
ties.

Dean of Students Tom Shandley
and Associate Dean of Students
Kathy Bray-Merrell both spoke
proudly of this new class of Wildcats,
boasting their statistics, both of geo-
graphical and ethnic diversity.
Shandley especially noticed their
“outstanding enthusiasm about be-
ing here.”

Bray-Merrell agreed wholeheart-
edly, saying, “I love this class. They
are such an energetic, engaged,
bright, and curious group of young
people.”

This enthusiasm, however, was not
always present when the first years

remembered their orientation expe-
rience. Rather, several of the first
years voiced their dislike for the re-
petitive meetings and information
sessions.

“Keep the speeches shorter and
more lively,” Karina Todd ’08 said.
“T do understand the need to get the
information across; however, with
the exceptions of Dean Shandley and
President Vagt, they got rather pain-
ful.”

Bray-Merrell said that the “issue
of balance is the key challenge of Ori-
entation. Itis important to keep new
students busy but not too over-
whelmed.”

The Orientation service project,
which is programmed for each en-
tering class, was alittle different this
year.

Accompanied by members of the
faculty, the first years participated in
a 6.2 mile CROP walk and luncheon

Honor Council holds open trial
Student found guilty of cheating in first open trial in two years

By Davip Crow
Editor-in-Chief

Last Thursday the Davidson Col-
lege Honor Council held their first
open trial in two years. Dr. Job Tho-
mas brought charges against Thomas
Powell ’04 of cheating on his final
exam in History 331.

Powell was ultimately found guilty
by the Honor Council and given'a
failing grade in History 331 and au-
thorized withdrawals in his other

courses that semester.
The trial began with the six mem-

bers of the Honor Council who would
act as the jury in this trial each re-
ceiving a packet containing a copy
of Powell’s final exam along with
copies ef websites Dr. Thomas had
found which he believed Powell had
used to cheat on his exam.

Dr. Thomas was the first witness
to testify. He stated that he became
suspicious about Powell’s exam
given the extremely high level or
accuracy, both factually and gram-
matically, of atest that was supposed
to have been conducted in only three
hours.

“This amount of accuracy is not
possible,” Dr. Thomas said. “I could
not get all these names right myself.”

Dr. Thomas went on to explain
how after he became suspicious of
Powell’s exam he conducted a
Google search for websites relating
to the topics on the exam.

The websites he found contained
texts virtually identical to what
Powell had written on his exam, right
down to the British spellings of cer-
tain words. ‘

A report from the Faculty Com-
mittee on Admission and Financial
Aid last April alleged that President
Vagt broke Faculty Bylaws by ad-
mitting a student to the class of 2008
who had already been deemed in-
admissible by the Committee.

In response to the report, the
Board of Trustees approved new
guidelines last month to improve
cooperation between the Commit-
tee and the President during the ad-
missions process.

The report signed by the six fac-
ulty members of the Committee
stated, “...we regret to report to the
Faculty that the President circum-
vented the admission process by
admitting to the Class of 2008 an
applicant who was denied admission
by a majority vote of the voting fac-
ulty serving on the Faculty Commit-
tee on Admission and Financial
Aid.”

The report was sent to the entire
faculty, and was subsequently
leaked by an unknown source
through email to many students,
raising questions as to whether or
not Vagt had in fact exceeded his au-
thority.

According to the Faculty Bylaws,
the Faculty Committee has “the au-
thority to determine by majority vote
the admissibility of any applicant.”
The Committee passes only the ap-

Trustees approve new

admission guidelines
Committee finds Vagt did not violate bylaws

plicants who meet a certain bench-
mark of admissibility to the Office
of Admission and Financial Aid. The
incoming class is selected from this
pool of ‘‘admissible” students.
The student referred to in the re-
port had not received a majority vote
in the Committee but had been
granted admissions by Vagt.

Incident highlights discrepan-
cies in admission protocol

While information on the incident
could not be obtained for legal rea-
sons, President Vagt said, “In the
course of the admissions process for
the class of 2008, a situation came
to the front that uncovered some
misunderstandings of the respective
roles of the Dean of Admissions,
Faculty Admissions Committee and
the President.”

“This was exacerbated by lack of
clarity and consistency in official
documents,” he continued.

The two inconsistent documents
Vagt mentioned were the Faculty
Bylaws, which were the basis of the
Committee’s complaint, and the
College’s Constitution.

According tothe Faculty Bylaws,
six teaching Faculty members and
the Dean of Admission and Finan-
cial Aid sit on the Committee. The
President and Dean of Faculty are
also members but do not have vot-
ing privileges.

Yet the Committee’s report
claimed that Vagt overstepped his
