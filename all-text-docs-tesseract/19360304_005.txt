made while standing on the
ofethe Eumenean Hall during his visit
to Davidson while he was President
of the United States.

Wilson made this visit twenty years
ago this May, while he was in Char-
lotte for the twentieth of May cele-
bration. He didn’t make up his mind
until that morning that he was com-
ing to Davidson,, and ‘as he wanted
the visit to be very informal, he
wouldn't even let Dr. William J. Mar-
tin, President of Davidson, precede
him to the college.

In some way the news leaked out
that he was going to visit Davidson,
and when he arrived here that evening
by motor, quite a crowd of students
and .townspeople had gathered — to
meet him

His party, consisting of himself, his
wife, Dri and Mrs. Martin, and sev-
eral secret service men drove up the
street facing the campus and around

He pointed out of the window to the
place where he chopped wood to heat
his room. This room was then occu-
pied by A. L. Young and H. B
Craig.

Tradition says that ofie of these
men was in the

room when he i

rived, and when he knocked on the
door, the man in the room asked him
who was there. Wilson answered,
“Woodrow Wilson,” and the boy yell-
ed back, “You can't fool me, but
come on in.” .Wilson entered, and it
is said when the boy saw who it was
he jumped out of the window. How-
ever, no documentary evidence to this
can be found.

When Wilson left Chambers, he
went to the Eumenean Society Hall
where he had received his first train-
ing in public speaking. He said of
this hall that it was substantially what
it was when he knew it, except that

of this his grades were a little high-

the entire year was 91.50%.

His sickness during the second
semester caused him to be out of
school quite a bit, for the record
shows that he had 44 excused ab-

church, and 66 from classes. Dur-

ancient

These cones found in the
ruins of a temple wall at Mugheir.
They are made of clay and are
about six inches high. These were

buried with several duplicates to

serve as a cornerstone for the tem-
ple so that people could tell who

built it. These cones were taken
from the temple built by Libit-
Ishtar, a prominent king of Baby-
lon, who was ruling at the time

of Abraham

The writing on the cones is the
best that has been discovered to
show the exact writing and civiliza-
tion.of the time of Abraham and
for this reason these small pieces
are extremely prectous-and-import-
ant to archaelogists the entire world
over.

Also there is in the museum a
household god taken from the tem-

2000 B.C. This made of
clay, is about two inches wide and
three high, and takes the form of
a woman with her hands crossed in
front of her breast.

This image is typical of the ones
made by the priests and sold to the
pilgrims who took them home and
put them in their prayer niches.

STANDARDIZED
UNIFORMITY

The simple mechanical details of cigarette
manufacture are of surprising importance.
Upon them depend the physical properties
of the cigarette, such as weight, size, firm-
ness, moisture-holding properties, uniformity
of fill—uniformity of product—all of which
have a far-reaching effect on the character
of its combustion and the constituents of
its smoke.

In the manufacture of Lucky Strike Ciga-
rettes all of these properties have been
standardized with care for the perfection of
A LIGHT SMOKE.

Recent chemical tests show” that other

popular brands have an excess of acid-
ity over Lucky Strike of from 53", to 100%.
