SEEK YE THE LIGHT

DR. TOM SCOTT, our easy going Athletic Di
sunk back in his swivel chair behind his prt age vo ag
long drag off his cigarette, and stated, “We've got to get
some new lights in that stadium if we expect to play
Catawba in the opening game next fall. If we don't, I
guess we'll just have to play them in Charlotte again.”

Scott has made it clear that he doesn’t want to pla
Catawba in Charlotte again. It just isn’t very fun slenton
in a 20,000 capacity stadium in front of 4,000 fans. But
even that's better than playing in the dark, which is al-
most the situation in Richardson Stadium.

We see no reason for the school to hesitate putting
in a better lighting system in the stadium. The school has
practically enough money in the Living Endowment Fund
and all the other funds to make the payroll stolen at the
famous Brink's Robbery look like chicken feed. Seriously,
the hill can afford to buy some new lights to replace the
present candlesticks.

The advantages of getting a better lighting system |

in the stadium are numerous. We all know how hot the
weather is around here in September and early October
(Remember the Furman game?), and our early home
games could be played under the lights. This would be
beneficial to both players and fans.

Another advantage point is the fact that we might
draw a few extra fans. Carolina, Duke, N. C. State, Clem-
son and Wake Forest are all within striking range of area
football fans, who prefer to watch the bigger schools
play. Since most all of these larger schools play afternoon
encounters, a few people might decide to try to make it
back to Davidson for a night game. For years many area
fans have witnessed a big time game in the afternoon,
and have hurried back to watch Lenoir Rhyne, Catawba,
Wofford, or Newberry at night.

There are other advantages such as better practice
conditions, better conditions for North High when they
play here, etc. We won't elaborate here, but simply make
a plea for a better lighting system in our stadium. Dav-
idson is progressive, isn’t she?

DEACS ARE HOPPING MAD

IF YOU THINK Wake Forest is taking the game with
us tomorrow night lightly, you’d better think again. The
Deacs will be trying to run us off the court, and they
have the team to do it. At the Wake Forest Tipoff lunch-
eon this week, co-captain Billy Packer served the ’Cats
the following warning as he spoke to Deacon alumni and
fans.

“We're proud to be rated number 3, but
won't be satisfied until we're number 1. But one
thing that annoys us is all this talk about Ohio
State. (The Deacs play the Buckeyes, currently
No. 1, next Saturday night.) We want people to
come out for all games.

“Saturday night, for instance, we play
Davidson. We were really humiliated after they
beat us last year. If don’t think 13 boys are
Se r revenge Saturday night

re, just don’t throw any raw meat out there.”

That’s right, Billy, a real.live Wildcat might gobble
it up.

FINAL CRYSTAL BALL RECORD: 41-20 (.672).

The Davidson College swimming team opens the
1961-62 season by meeting Clemson this Wednesday in
the first of two pre-Christmas meets. A third meet with
South Carolina was cancelled due to the elimination of
the swimming program at that institution.

Davidson's matmen began at
7:30 tonight in Johnston
Gymnasium. The Wildcats
played host to the Pfeiffer
Falcons.

Coach Charlie Parker stated
that he had little information
on the Pfeiffer matmen since
they have only three boys re-
turning from last year’s team.
Parker did, however, indicate
that it would be a “pretty good”
match.

Last year Davidson met Pfeif-
fer twice, taking a clean sweep
in their second match, 30-0.

tomorrow night by attacking

It’s an ambitious start for a
team that features three sopho-
mores in its starting line up; but
after last year’s opener with
Wake, few will tag it outright
foolhardiness, especially Coach
Lefty Driesell.

“We're going up there to win
it,” he asserts unhesitatingly.

Still, Driesell must spearhead
his invasion with a club molded
around a series of pre-season
question marks. He expects

D Club Initiates

The Davidson College Mono-
gram Club, better known as the
D. Club, held its fall initiation
this past Tuesday night Presi-
dent Bruce Usher announced.

D Club one must have a mono-
gram, either for participation in
or for managing of a varsity
sport and one must be invited.

New initiates numbered 34
and included the following:
Frank MecPhillips, Tom Tuttle,
Kent Tucker, Morris Williams,
Fred Schoen, Jerry Sheffield,
Tom Hamilton, Michie Slaugh-

ter, Jimmy Young, Andy Glar-
ner, John Sharpe, Dave Lopp,
Russell Walls, Bob McDonald,

Clark, a 6-1, 195-Ib. senior |
from Statesville, N. C., is the
only Wildcat to receive recogni-
tion on this year’s All-Confer-
ence team. He is highly re-
nowned for his hard-nosed brand
of football, and he is regarded
by many as the best defensive
end in the conference. In addi-
tion to his defensive ability,
Clark was one of Davidson's top
pass receivers this year, and he
pulled down 3 _ touchdown

Booker Clark Rates An
All-Conference Mention

Booker Clark, end and co-captain for the Davidson
football team this fall, was named to the honorable men-
tion list of the 1961 All-Southern Conference squad, an-

year’s squad. The Citadel, con-
ference champs, placed two men
on the first team as did George
Washington, Richmond, and
West Virginia. The team was
unique in two ways: for the first
time since 1955 VMI. did not
place a man on the first unit,
and there were no quarterbacks
on the first team.

The team is chosen in ballot-
ing among conference coaches,
members of the Southern Con-
ference sportswriters associa-
tion, and area sportscasters.

mermen will be in good shape
for the meet and says, “Each
man will give 100 per cent ef-
fort.”

“Although we are lacking in
depth,” Shoe continued, “the,
boys seem more interested and |
are more willing to work than)
last year’s team. }

Last year the Wildcat swim-
mers won pretty handily over
the Clemson team, but with the
help of some good sophomores,
the Tigers are certain to give a
better showing this year.

The Davidson freshman team
also looks very good in practice
and is considered to have more
depth than previous freshman
teams. Looking exceptionally
well are Jim Alexander, Jim
Grey, Steve Davidson, and Purk

Purkerson.

freshman and varsity teams will
travel to Boone to meet Ap-
palachian in another non-con-
ference meet.

Soccermen Finish
Winning Season

The soccer team closed its
season on a winning note on the
Saturday prior to Thanksgiving
with a 43 overtime victory over
Emory in Atlanta.

Walt Eckman booted in the
winning goal, but Greg Wink-
ler’s two penalty kicks had kept
the "Cats in the game prior to
Eckman’s clutch kick.

Thus Coach Harry Fogelman’s
men closed out a hot and cold
5-4-1 season, hampered by in-
juries and other difficulties.
