NORRIS TROPHY VOTE

The first of a series of student
body ballots, being taken by, the
Athletic Association in an effort to
pick the winner of the Norris Ath-

letic Trophy, resulted Wednesday
morning in the nomination of a
vast number of Wildcat athletes,

with Harrison, Bohannon, and Dick
Grey leading the nominees
by safe margins. These three men
will compete in a second election
to be held in a few weeks, these
elections being continued until one
of the three candidates secures a
sufficient majority to win the cup.
The Norris Trophy, in the form
of a beautiful silver loving cup, is
awarded each year by the Norris
Candy Company, of Atlanta, to the
most outstanding Davidson athlete
of the year. The cup becomes the
permanent property of its winner.
