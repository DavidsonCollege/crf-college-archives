Who, What and Where Among the Alumni

Prof. A. Currie Great Factor in
Developing Davidson's
Debating Teams
Has Great Gift as an impressive

Teacher—Came to Da-
vidson in 1901

Archibald Currie was -born at Hills-
boro, N. C., in 1876. He entered David-
son College in 1893, graduating in 1897
with the A.B. degree, having won the
Debater’s Medal. He then taught for
one year at Coleman, Texas. For three
years following, he was principal of the
Davidson High School. In 1901, he was
elected adjunst professor of Mathemat-
ics, Latin, and Greek at Davidson. In
1912, he became Professor of Elemen-
tary Law, Public Speaking, and Politi-
cal Science,

Prof. Currie is a past master in the
art of teaching. He imparts knowledge
with singular thoroughness. His facility
of illustration, his incisive directness in
discussion, and the clearness of his every
utterance, make him a professor always
able to add clearness and sharpness of
definition to the so often blurred images
in a student’s mind.

It is not to be forgotten that a very
large part of the success of Davidson’s
debating teams is due to Prof. Currie.
As chairman of the committee of the
faculty on inter-collegiate debates, he
takes an active interest in the work of
these teams, advises them, and superin-
tends generally their work in preparation
for these contests. In the same field is
his supervision of the Oratorical ex-
ercises of the junior and senior classes
each year.

E. B. Burns Cited for Bravery.

E. B. Burns, ex '19, Co. K. 118 in-
fantry was cited by General Pershing.

“for distinguished and exceptional gal-

lantry at Villeret, France, on Septem-
ber 26th, 1918.” During the operations
near Villeret this soldier acted as stretch-
er bearer and never hesitated during the
heaviest enemy shell fire and for four
days and nights worked almost continu-
ously administering to the wounded. On
‘one occasion, when a comrade was
wounded in an advanced outpost, about
250 yards in front of the line, Burns
volunteered to go and get him through
very heavy shell fire and in plain view
of the enemy, carried the wounded man
to a place of safety; saving his life.” A
shell exploded so close to them that Mr.
Burns’ watch was torn from his arm.

R. 0. T. C. NEWS.
Who Will Get the Trophy?

An increased desire to do the best pos-
sible work in the drills should move all
‘of us: Major Hall authorizes the state-
ment that at all parades the drill is close-
ly observed and the platoon performing
its part best is picked and a record kept.
At the end of the session the platoon
which has been picked oftenest will be
awarded an appropriate trophy, one of
which the members of the platoon may
be proud. Every platoon should do its
best , for all have an equal chance to win.

At the parade Friday afternoon the
and platoon of C company, under Lt.
Doubles, was chosen as the best. Which
will be next?

Purchase of Clothing and Supplies.

Army clothing and supplies may be
purchased at the quarter-master’s prices
by students in the R. O. T. C. This
clothing is very serviceable, and is much
cheaper than civilian clothing, and it
may be to your interest to look into the
matter,’ Anyone desiring prices or other
information should see Sgt. Carroll at
on

ce.
After the supply now in the armory is
exhausted no overcoats will be issued to
students. This is a recent ruling, and
men who are not now fitted and who
cannot get fitted are advised to buy a
‘regulation overcoat, price $13.50, and
thereby obtain the full outfit. It is pos-
sible that overcoat will be needed for
parades when the colder weather arrives,
and it will spoil the appearance of the
outfit to have two or three men not
fully equipped. If you are not supplied
investigate the matter at once,

At the end of one year the uniforms
issued to R. O. T. C. students will be-

come their own. The student will
then be entitled to a new issue. The
Davidson R. O. T. C. will no¢ be sub-
ject to a new issue before February.

No more overcoats will be issued.
The ones already out, however, will not
be taken up, but will become the person-
tal property of their owners after one
‘year.

The extra shirts, hat straps, and in-
signia that have never come, will be
issued on their arrival.

L. A. Chambliss, ’19, is Advertising
copy writer in the Publicity Department
of the Guaranty Trust Co.. of New
York. He is living at 200 W. 1ogth
Street.

Rev. R. C. Long, '13, has been elected
State Chaplain of the American Legion
of West Virginia. Mr. Long entered
the service as a private and left it as
Chaplain, ranking as first lieutenant.

FACULTY EXTENDS
CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS

Christmas holidays have been ex-
tended four days longer. Exams

are over on Friday, the 19th, and.

college opens again Friday, Jan-
uary 2nd.

This decision was reached by the
faculty after considering the , fact
that many students live so far
away. Many boys would not get
home before Christmas day if school
did not close before the 23rd. Ev-

erybody can now reach home in
time to help Santa Claus in his great
work,
