““T’'lebe seeing Germany a way
no tourist can. From the cockpit
of an Army Chinook helicopter.

“T’m being assigned to a Chi-
nook helicopter unit in Germany
as a test pilot and maintenance
officer, and I’m proud that I'll
be the first woman to haye that
assignment over there. It's a real
thrill for me. |

“So was learning how to fly
a helicopter. It takesalot more
skill than an airplane. If you think
college is demanding, flight
schoo] is even tougher. It's not
only academically demanding,
it’s really mentally demanding as
well as physically.

“In Germany, I'll have a
chance to use some of the leader-
ship and management techniques
[learned in ROTC. It’s going
to bea real challenge having com-
mand responsibilities.
