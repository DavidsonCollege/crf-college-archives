Soccer team beats VMI, ties Erskine

By ANDY BARRON

Davidson’s soccer team did
not have a blockbuster week equi-
valent to their previous week’s ef-
fort. Yet the Wildcats showed tre-
mendous poise in coming back to
tie Erskine 3-3 last Saturday and
determination in beating VMI 3-1
on a rain-soaked field on Wednes-
day.

Davidson is now 4-4-1 on the
year and 2-0 in Southern Confer-
ence play. The Wildcats are the
only undefeated team in their half
of the conference.

After the great success of the
week before the Erskine game, a
let down loomed as an ominous
threat to Davidson’s rapid tur-
naround of fortune. Erskine was
the perfect opponent to lull David-
son into a lackluster performance.
Though Erskine is 16th ranked in
the NAIA and gave defending na-
tional champion Clemson all they
could handle, it isn’t easy to get as
excited about playing Erskine as it
is when playing Duke.

At first, Davidson’s fears
were realized as Erskine jumped
out to a 2-0 lead in the first half.
“Erskine got some great shots,”
coach Charlie Slagle said. “We
weren't playing that badly, they
just happened to be playing well.”

Momentum made a quick shift
to Davidson's side just before the
first half ended. Senior Sean Au-
stin got clear on a break away and
beat the goalie to get a open shot
on goal. Before Austin could
shoot, however, he was tackled by
Erskine’s goalie. The referee
awarded a penalty kick which
senior Wallis Goodman deposited
in the back of the net., The goal
long. Erskine scored again to knot
the score at three. Neither team
was able to score again despite
twenty minutes of overtime.

Slagle was not disappointed
with a tie. “I look at the game
thinking we came back from a 2-0
deficit, not that we blew a 3-2
lead,” Slagle said. “They were a
tough team. Both sides played
well and I'm glad we got out of
there without a loss.”

Davidson’s game with VMI

last Wednesday could not have.

been played on a wetter field.
Despite playing on a surface that
bore a closer resemblance to Lake
Norman than a_ soccer field,
Davidson scored quickly and
never trailed. Senior Tony Cab-
rales rammed a crowd pleaser off
the post that landed, conve-
niently, at junior Bran
came with nine seconds remaining
in the first half. Halftime score:
Erskine 2, Davidson 1.

In the second half Davidson
gave “a clinic in set plays,” in the
words of assistant coach David
Flowers. Junior Steve Stith
launched a rocket shot in to the
upper left hand corner of the goal
on an indirect free kick to tie the
game. Later, sophomore Steve
Ott, who tapped the ball to Stith
on the second goal, gave David-
son the lead on a direct free kick.

“I knew we’d have to do well
on set plays to score consistently
against the caliber of competition
we scheduled this season,” Slagle
commented. “Lately, we’ve been
executing set plays well and it’s
helped us a lot.”

Unfortunately, Davidson
wasn’t able to hold the lead for
Shockley’s feet. Shockley took
advantage of the situation and
scored an easy goal to give David-
son a 1-0 lead. Shortly afterwards,
sophomore Tracy Hankins made
the score 2-0.

In the second half, junior
sweeper Chris Jones headed in a
goal on a corner kick to make the
score 3-0. VMI also added a
header on a corner kick to make
the final 3-1.

Davidson hosts defending
Southern Conference champion
Furman tomorrow at 11:30 a.m.
This could be a preview of this
season’s Southern Conference
championship game as Furman is
the clear favorite in the confer-
ence’s Southern Division. On
Monday, Davidson hosts cross-
country rival UNCC.

Cross country team

By RAND HARTSELL

To the victor go _ the
spoils . . . (or some such thing as
that). Afternoon shopping trips to
Charlotte? Beach Boys tickets?
Getting the coaches’ ears pierced?
Hot-pink running tights? What
kind of workouts are these? After
cruising to victory for the second
straight weekend, Davidson’s
women's cross-country team evi-
dently feels it’s entitled to a few
frivolities. Davidson scored 16
points to Furman’s 39.

Apparently, however, the
Cat’s afternoon excursion into
Charlotte has resulted in a lapse of
mental focus. When asked how
she expected the team to do in this

weekend's NAIA regional meet at
Pembroke State, senior captain
Judy Dalton, suffering from acute
psychological — unpreparedness
claimed, “Well, if we get our of-
fense together, I think we score
two touchdowns.” More likely,
however, is that Dalton was
merely delirious from Monday’s
strenuous workout. None of the
team members. seemed too ad-
verse to Coach Sterling Martin’s
recommendation that everyone
“take it easy.”

The workout will have served
its purpose by this time next week.
The women should continue their
winning ways. With all the run-
ners improving every week and

Soccer team scrambles for control of the ball.

Gridders now 0-4

Newberry thumps Davidson

By MIKE ADAMS

Newberry College ran and
passed over, around and through
Davidson to hand the Wildcats
their worst defeat of the season,
41-0, on Saturday.

Newberry outplayed the Cats
in every aspect of the game. They
piled up 452 yards of total offense
while holding Davidson to 103
yards. Newberry had 26 first
downs while the Cats could man-
age only seven. Newberry gained
more yards rushing and more
yards passing than Davidson.

Offensively, the Cats seemed
unable to generate anything.
Davidson’s longest drive of the
day gained only 40 yards in eight
plays.

Sophomore Charlie Winborne
got his first start at quarterback,
but was ineffective. He completed
only three of ten passes for 19
yards. Winborne also handled the
punting chores for the Wildcats
and had nine punts for a 33-yard

average. Winborne was forced to
punt because the Wildcats’ regu-
lar punter and leading receiver,
senior Jay Poag, missed the game
due to an injury.

Juniors Steve Bradley and
Jack McCollum also saw action at
quarterback. Bradley was I 1 of 18
for 67 yards and McCollum com-
pleted five of ten passed for 46
yards.

The Cats were again hurt by an
ineffective ground game. The
rushing attack actually lost 28
yards in the game.

One positive offesive note was
the play of freshman Brian Over-
cash. He led the Cats in receiving
with six catches for 40 yards.
Davidson has little depth and it is
encouraging to see contributions
from freshmen.

Davidson's defense gave up a
lot of points and a lot of yards to
Newberry. Head coach Vic Gatto
spoke well of their effort, how-
ever. “Our defense really stayed

with it at Newberry, but we were
on the field too long,” he said.
Davidson has little depth at almost
every defensive position and
Newberry was able to wear them
down.

Sophomore noseguard
Emanuel Burch and junior defen-
sive end Marcus Allen played well
on defense for the Cats. Accord-
ing to Gatto, “Burch has had four
good games in a row.”

The struggling Wildcats will
try to improve their 0-4 record
against the Paladins at Furman ina
1:30 game at Richardson Stadium
on Saturday. Furman may be the
toughest opponent of the year and
they are coming off of a big win
against North Carolina State this
past weekend.

Poag will probably be avail-
able for Saturday’s game, but
senior running back Horace
Manor will not be able to play.

optimistic about regionals

with the addition of sophomore
transfer Sarah Longley, the Cats
should have little trouble with
Campbell University or Pembroke
State. Should Davidson win the
meet, they will travel to Kenosha,
WI in November to compete in the
NAIA National Championships.
It would be the women’s team’s
fourth consecutive trip to
Kenosha.

The men’s team hopes to
accompany the women to the
championship. While the first two
races of the season left much to be
said in terms of the men’s team’s
overall performance, Saturday
proved to be their best effort to
date. Even though the Citadel was

far and away the class of the field,
Davidson’s men’s team nearly av-
enged their early season loss to
Furman. The final tally showed
the Citadel the easy winner with
17 points. Furman squeak by the

cats 56-61.

One reason for the Cats’ im-
provement was junior Greg Fore-
man’s long-awaited return to
fame. Foreman followed senior
captain Frank Hague by only 16
seconds as Hague set another per-
sonal record for 5 miles. Senior
Rob Watkins, freshman Bill
Whitfield and junior Emil Cekada
fill out Davidson’s — scoring.
Davidson will again need strong
performances tomorrow. Their

only competition will come from
Pembroke State. In order for the
Cats to qualify for the National
Championship, they must win the
meet. Senior Taylor Simpson's
return from an injury hiatus will
aid the Cats’ cause. The flat
course will be to the team’s liking.

With good running, both the
men’s and women’s teams will
have the good fortune of of enjoy-
ing the spoils of victory — the ex-
cursion to Kenosha and the frivol-
ity of taking their exams early.
The NAIA National Champion-
ship has a penchant for coinciding
with the weekend of fall term
exams.
