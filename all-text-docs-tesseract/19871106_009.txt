Alcohol use and abuse: :
What do you really know?

Alcohol use on campus is a fact.
Let’s test your knowledge on the
subject with a true-or-false quiz
from the people at Brown Univer-
sity:

1. Blacking outiscommon after
drinking and is no reason for con-
cern.

2. Liquor taken scainhe will
affect you faster than liquor mixed
with water.

3. Alcohol is a sexual stimulant.

4. The most abusive drinkers
are men in their early 30s and
women in their early 40s.

_ 5. Taking cold showers, getting
fresh air, and drinking milk or
black coffee can be effective ways
of sobering up.

6. Eating a substantial amount
of food before drinking slows
down the absorption of alcohol.

7. Women using birth control
pills metabolize alcohol more
slowly than women who don’t use
them.

8. Responsible drinking can
result in relaxation and enhanced
social interaction.

Chambers Gallery Exhibit:

9. After ingestion, it takes from
3 to 20 minutes for alcohol to
permeate every body cell.

10. To prevent a hangover, one
should sip one’s drink slowly,
drink and eat at the same time,
space drinks over a period of time,
and’ avoid “exceeding one’s
limit.”

Answers:

1. False. Often one of the first
signs of an alcohol problem is a
blackout.

2. True. Straight liquor reaches
the brain more quickly because it
is absorbed into the bloodstream
more readily than diluted liquor.

3. False. The more you drink,
the more your sexual capacity is
reduced, Alcohol may stimulate
your interest in sex, but it will also
interfere with your ability to per-
form.

4. False. The most abusive
drinkersare men in their early 20s.
Women tend to drink most heav-

A look at the human unconscious

By CAREY PICKARD

Artis a highly personal form of
nonverbal communication in
which visual images serve to
conjure up emotions from within
the human. soul. Because art. is
such an intensely personal. me-
dium, there is no single “right”

»way to view a work of art.
Herb Jackson, in his exhibition
of Monotypes currently being
- shown inthe Chambers Gallery, is
offering the students of Davidson
an opportunity to explore emo-

tions which sometimes are not.

dealt with on a daily basis ‘at
Davidson.

Jackson’s work is an attempt to,
appeal to the unconscious within
us all, His work does not offer

~ specific concrete images, but

rather it offers a chance for each, |.

viewer to find his own meanings
within a particular work.
Jackson’s art is a search for indi-
vidual meaning, his works are not
merely decorative, for each work

-has.an inner _life of its own. ‘

While it is presumptuous to
give a single factor or group of
factors credit for the level of per-

-sonal intensity achieved in

Jackson’s work, his choice of
medium--the monotype--plays a
great role in what he achieves, A
monotype is made by applying
paint to a surface and transferring
the image to paper through the use
of pressure.

The result is unlike any other art
form. Itis more similar to drawing
than painting for there is no real
layering involved, although a
print can be run through a press

Spoof O’ the Week

Big Boy on campus:

a new

Davidson restaurant franchise?

‘By BILL SCOUTEN
and CHIP SEIDEL

Satire still has a place in Ameri-
can society. The staff is happy to
report that in response to last
week’s column, “Mysteries of the
salad bar revealed,” the arrange-
ment of the salad bar has seen a
change. In orde? to cut down on
crouton and bacon-bit immersion
in salad dressings, the two con-
tainers are now placed in the salad
pit itself,

Since the change, the salad bar
has seen a marked surge in clean-
liness. One Commons worker
commented on the change saying,
“It’s the best thing since diced

* onions; now hungry students have

no trouble at all getting croutons
or bacon bits. There’s room for
two hands under the plexiglass
protector....more hand room
means less mess.” However, the
Commons is again in the news....

Has the Vail Commons become
a restaurant franchise? It would
seem so....Friday morning, Octo-
ber twenty-third, as the sun was
rising, frost on the ground, We
were jolted by the sight of
Shoney’s Big Boy onthe top of the
commons.

Amused, but still wary of an-
other one of Mr. Pritchard’s en-
trepreneurial gimmicks, we went
on our way. Later we were in-
formed that meal cards were no
longer being accepted.... “This is
Shoney’s!” the cashier said.

4 + Threatened with the prospect of
competing with the new Food
Lion (oops! I mean the Union
Cafe), the Davidson Food Service
feels it may be time to look toward
a greater operation for the

more than once.

This time element does several
things. First, it adds an element of
spontaneity. Jackson does not
have any preconceived ideas

.when-_he_begins_a picture. What
appears flows forth from his un-
conscious. The technique is more
similar to drawing than painting,
as each individual stroke is impor-

tant to the overall création. This
time element also adds a degree of
tension to the work. Because of
the quick nature of the medium,
and the great expense of using a
press, there is little time to medi-

tate and ponder each piece. Each .

creation is an expression of a par-
ticular moment.

The intensity involved in re-
leasing one’s soul on paper is a
very draining process. Jackson

Davidson campus. It is rumored
that the Commons has been ac-
cepting bids from numerous fast
food franchises nationwide.

Idle gossip around the campus
suggests that some of the prospec-
tive franchises are the renowned

Davidson student favorite) What-

the platform party, and unveil the

the ceiling, covering the Sesqui-
centennial banner. '

tion is the. Massachusetts based:

Fong’s Manchu House of Pizza.
Lately, however, it seems that
all of these franchises have fallen

by the wayside. The new front- °

runner appears to be Shoney’s Big
Boy. Just as the Stay-Puft marsh-
mallow man attacked NYC in
Ghostbusters, the giant Big Boy
could become the new Davidson
College terror. Already, work-
men have been spotted attempting
to install a Shoney’s sign on the
Commons roof.

Centered perfectly, the colors
of the roof and building seem to
complement Big Boy’s checkered
trousers. One student com-
mented, “the combination is a
wonderful blend of passionate
reds coupled with a mellow green,
which results in an aesthetically
pleasing arrangement.” The
sign’s removal was mandated,
however, due to what is termed an
alleged display of favoritism dom
to a final decision.

It has been brought to the atten-

tion of the staff that the supporters
of the Shoney’s franchise would
not stop with an answer of “no!”
Rather, they planned to sponsor a

This inward pain is often the
catalyst which brings anew. di-

the creation process, s/he is still
able to experience some sense of

It is this final emotional

open mind, not a discerning eye to
appreciate what Jackson has cre-

However, the plan was discovered -
prior to the ceremony. The
Shoney’s sign was removed from
the auditorium, and Convocation
proceeded as planned.

Indeed, the Shoney’s buy-out i is
still in a preliminary phase, but it
could occuras soon as Thanksgiv- |
ing break. When consulted about
the possibility of Shoney’s in the
place of the Commons, students -
generally responded favorably.
However, several students were
tentative. Jon “Blackbird” Giles,
famous student guitarist, re-
sponded, “I hate it!.Shoney’s is a
grease pit!” He also added that
Shoney’s would lack the variety
that the Commons currently pro-
vides.

David Spong(e) enthusiasti-
cally commented, “they have the
best breakfast bar anywhere...”
however, Ellen Morrissey be-
lieves that “the food resembles
and tastes like pre-chewed card-
board.”

When asked about the impact
that the new franchise would have
on the Davidson community, an
anonymous student suggested
that the new food service would
not be noticed. However,.a statue
would stand tall, a beacon to
hungry Davidson men and
women. “Shoney’s is good,
man..:. they’ve got the Big Boy.”
