THE FACULTY finally made itself clear on the |
inactive eligibility question in a written recommenda- |
tion to the IMAC last Wednesday. The faculty athletic
committee presented its resolution to the general faculty |
and it was passed in the April 5 meeting.

The resolution, briefly, advises that inactive fra-
ternity members should be allowed to participate on
the ~—— a teams in the Intramural Athletic
league. The faculty admonished the IMAC to “act as
you see fit” on the question.

IN THEIR scheduled meeting Wednesday night, the
IMAC voted to re-affirm their first ruling, which declared |
inactives ineligible for the spring sports ag basket-
ball and handball. President Tyree Finch, however,
stated that the IMAC has taken positive action on the
faculty recommendation, which has been turned over to
the Rules and Regulations committee for study. The
IMAC will take definite action on April 20, at their next
scheduled meeting.

He emphasized that his group was treating the facul-|
ty’s advice with careful consideration and respect.

Finch said that the IMAC would probably end up|
taking the following action: .

1. Inactive fraternity members will be eligible to |
play on the Independent teams only after waiting out |
a full semester of ineligibility. This provision will go |
into effect at the beginning of the fall semester this |

ear.
2. The ruling that is now in effect will remain
binding until the end of this semester.

WE AGREE with the IMAC in its decision to stand
firm on their present ruling until the end of the semester.
This is a young organization—only in its second year of
operation. It has yet to gain the respect of the students
—even those interested in athletics—as an important
administrative body. But its operation is essential to an
organized intramural program. If it backs down now,
its decisions will always be thought of as the products
of a vacillating, indecisive group and it will have no
firm control of the program.

Early last month Davidson's
netters were looking forward to
three matches—with The Cita-
del, M.LT. and N. C. State—be-
cause these promised to be the
ones which could make the dif-
ference between a winning and
a losing season.

The first two matches have
come and gone. The Citadel,
here March 25, outlasted the

which Coach Keesler says was
“the real test,” produced a
second Wildcat loss, 7-2.

HE MEANS IT

So when Keesler talks about
the Wolfpack who play here to-
morrow and says “that’s one
match we're counting on win-
ning,” you know he means it.

Davidson had a 3-5 record
going into the Wofford scrap
here today. Victories’ over the
Terriers and the Wolfpack
would put the Cats where they
want to be (or where they have
to be) with a rough and tight
wind-up schedule ahead of
them.

FROM ONE FRONT

State succumbed to the Wild-
cats last spring,

Davidson's early season ef-
forts were: Pfeiffer, 60; George
Washington, 3-6; Presbyterian,
0-9; Mercer, 9-0; and Richmond,

The road ahead looks rough.

day. Miami netters, tops in the
South, will be here.

Davidson's varsity baseball
team, which stroked the win
column for the first time this
week. will stay at home this
weekend for games with Ober-
lin College and William and
Mary.

Oberlin, meeting the Wildcats
this afternoon, will engage
them again tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. William and Mary arrives
Monday for a doubleheader.

Information on Oberlin was
searce around the athletic de-
partment this week, but Coach
Tom Stevens said the team is

. in “about the same class we are

-—no scholarship help.”

Oberlin holds a win over Bel-
15-8.

Presbyterian College broke
the Wildcat losing streak—six
straight—on Wednesday. David-
son's Dee Green held the hosts
to half a dozen hits, five of
them after the sixth inning.
Green, pitching the entire
game, got batting help to the
tune of five in the first inning
as the Wildcats romped, 9.2.

Leading batsmen for’ David-
son were leftfielder Ed Hines
and rightfielder Harry Cline,
both of whom collected a pair
of hits and RBI's.

For the Oberlin game today
Stevens was planning to start
sophomore southpaw Nick Daves
on the mound. Another sopho-
more Graham Showalter, hard
throwing righthander, will prob-
ably pitch tomorrow.

Said Stevens, “Showalter is

Davidson Walks Off
With State Title
In Rifle Tourney

The Davidson rifle team, pac-
ed by stellar performances from
Stan Gaines and Don Harper,
breezed to its second champion-
ship of the year in winning the
North Caroline Invitational lest
week.

The locals were first (with
3692 points) in a field of 10
ROTC squads frem all over the
state. The win gave Davidson
the state championship. Wake
Forest was second with 23674
points, followed by the Care
lina NROTC and State ROTC.

Stan Gaines posted the second
highest overall score and was
first in the kneeling position.
Harper was third overall and
first in the prone position.
The Davidson team, coathed
by Sgt. Jim McCurry, finished
the season with a 22-10 overalt
record and an 8-1 record in the
Western Carolina Conference.
They had earlier won the West-
ern Carolina tournament. The
locals placed sixth-in the South-
ern Conference meet which was
held here in early March.

Coach McCurry commented
that his boys had made consid-
erable improvement over last
year and predicted a good year
to come, in spite of the loss of
Co.captain Joe Wearn, a con-
sistant scorer. “We need to pick
up some depth,” he said. “This
year we only had about five
men we could really depend on.

| There are three or four fresh-
Imen who might come through,
| though.”
