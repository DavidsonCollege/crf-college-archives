If it is possible for a game to
determine the conference
championship without involving
the league front-runner, the

ais

contest between William and
Mary and _ Davidson at
Richardson Field Saturday
could be just that.

“William and Mary should be
undefeated.’’ said Davidson
head coach Dave Fagg. “They
lost a couple of close ones. They

Sporting only a 4-4 record. the
Indians are coming off a big win
over VPI.

“They have an exceptionally
fine secondary.’ warned Fagg.

who said he was ‘‘one of the
better defenders in call the
South.”

Scotty Shipp will have to be at
his best tomorrow. if the Cats
are to be able to penetrate the
tough Indian defense. Shipp has
passed for 1279 yards, hitting on
56 per cent of his passes.

“They will change their
defense on almost every play.”
Fagg commented. “It will
really be a challenge to see if we
can get going offensively.”

With Dave Ingold, the
premier Wildcat running back
still suffering from a_ foot
injury, Davidson will have to
rely on John Webel for most of
the work in the backfield.

Fagg said that Alton
McCallum should be back in
action. Freshman Jeff
Heinicka, Steve Still, and Greg
Love will provide the additional
running strength.

Walt Walker will be trying to
pad his Southern Conference
lead in the receiving
department. The _ all-SC
candidate was praised by Fagg
for his tremendous showing
against Bucknell last week.

inet Walker Lead Conference

By JIM SITTERSON

Davidson currently has one of
the best quarterbacks and
receivers in the nation.

Quarterback Scotty Shipp is
ranked ninth nationally in
terms of total offensive
yardage. Flanker Walt Walker
is sixth in pass receptions.

Both Walker and Shipp are
leading their departments in
the Southern Conference at the
moment.

Complementing these two are
split end Andy Davis and tight
end Mike Harding.

Offensive backfield coach
Ernie Tall works with the
receivers and quarterbacks on
the team. In Shipp. Tall feels
the team has a dedicated
leader.

“Scotty has really worked
this vear. He's studied and
really wants to play.” Tall said.

Tall. Davis. Walker. and
Harding all expressed
confidence that Shipp will be
selected as the All-conference
quarterback this vear

“He's certainly the top
contender.’ according to Tall.

Davis and Walker were less
reserved in their praise of
Shipp.

‘*He’s the best in the league,”
said Davis while Walker felt
that, “Scotty's one of the most
outstanding plavers in the
conference.”

Walker was mentioned as
another All-conference
certainty. “He is the fastest
man on the team.” according to
Shipp. Tall said that, ‘Walt has
good speed and can't be covered
one on ene by anybody.” Shipp
added that, “Walt is the best
flanker in the conference.”

Walker's favorite pattern is a
down and out with several
varitions. He operates best
from a slot formation.

Walker feels that some of the
praise directed towards him is
undeserved.

“Early in the season most
teams concentrated on Andy
and not me. They might try to
double team Andy and_ this
would leave me open.”

Davis is currently second in
receptions in the conference.
right behind Walker. He has an
excellent chance of making the
All-conterence team.

According to Tall, ‘‘He has
good speed and runs his
patterns really well.’’ Shipp
feels, ‘Andy has deceptive
speed and great hands."

Shipp and Davis have worked
together for four years and
Shipp finds this a definite asset.

‘‘l can pretty much read what
Andy's moves will be and that
lets me get the ball there a split
second sooner,” he said.

Davis credits coaches Fagg
and Tall with a lot of success.

“Coach Tall is always helping
us out and working with us.
Coach Fagg works with us a lot
too. He’s constantly picking up
a lot of little stuff that helps us a
lot.” he said.

Mike Harding is the third
starting receiver. He is not at
the top of any statistics, but he

has earned respect for his
blocking.
Tall. Shipp. and Walker all

agreed that Harding is the
strongest and best blocking end
on the team.

Harding views his blocking as
a challenge.

“T like to get a chance to get
in and mix it with the big boys.

You really get a teeling of
accomplishment) when you
move one of them = out.” he
stated.

Harding is a very good runner
alter he has caught the ball. and
Tall expressed regret that
Harding does not get thrown to
that often

“Their success depends a lot
on if can run my pattern and
clear a space for them to get
open.” he said

Saturday will be the stiffest test
yet according to Fagg, because

has faced all year.

in 143 carries. Tailback Doug
Gerhart has romped 536 yards

in 99 attempts.
“They have a fine
quarterback who runs the

option really well,” said Fagg.
“We will probably see a lot of
drop backs on the play action
pass.”

Bill Deery directs the Tribe's
attack. He has completed 35
passes for 604 yards. But the
story is his running on the
option. He has carried 99 times
for 538 vards. This will be the
best executing team on_ the
option that the Wildcats have
faced this season.

Receiving most of Deery's
flicks will be David Knight, one
of the Southern Conference's
premier receivers, ranked not
far below Walker. He has
hauled in 29 passes for 534 yards
or 18.4 yards per reception.

“They have one of the best
receivers in the South in
Knight," said Fagg. ‘‘He is
probably just behind Walker.”

In rating the Indians with
their last victim, Bucknell,
Fagg typified the Tribe as
‘‘appreciably stronger and
quicker than the Bisons. Their
offensive unit will be a sever
test for our defense. They have
a big, strong and aggressive
line. They will really be tough,’

Notably, there should be
some adjustment in the
defensive alignment to attempt
to contain the option. Fagg said,
‘‘We will try to take our forcing
unit and make adjustments
versus their strong running
game. We will have to be tough
the entire game to contain
them.”

With East Carolina leading

the Southern Conference,
this game is crucial for
William and Mary.

“William and Mary will be
coming in here looking for a
brush-up for ECU,"’ said Fagg.

“They will be out for blood.
Coming off two big wins, they
will be ready.”
