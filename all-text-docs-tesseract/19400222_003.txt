THE DAVIDSONIAN

Question

aA ‘hie Week

Due to the approaching elections

and to the controversy stirred up
by the recent discussions in the
Davidsonian, the prevailing ques-
tion of the week is again in re-
gards to politics on the Davidson
campus. Last week in an editorial
The Davidsonian offered a_ plan
which it believed. svould help to
solve some of the problems that

have arisen during student elections
the The
section of opinion was received in
answer to the question: What do
you think of the plan for a board
as outlined in The
Davidsonian last week?

Tom Fry, Senior:

in past. following cross-

of elections

I think the plan offered by The
Davidsonian is far superior to the
one offered by ODk. It is, how-
ever, by no means perfect. A fra-
tefnity man is not going to in-
criminate his own fraternity, and
Will” hésitate to incriminate—other
fraternities if—hisis guilty in any

are an
Karl Jonas, Junior:

The plan as outlined by The Da-
vidsonian seems to be a good rem-
edy for a situation which has long
been in need of improvement. This
plan for a board of elections, I be-
lieve, is the second best of the
plans submitted. I personally am in
favor of open politics, but as that
seems to be such a remote possibil-
ity as to be a lost cause, this board
of elections has my vote if it ever
reaches the polls. However, one
point which has been omitted and
which I think is important, is an
efficient and impartial set of pro-
visions for the election or appoint-
ment of a capable, serious-minded,
board of elections. When this has
been added, I think the plan should
be adopted.

Julian Squires, Sophomore:
I think that as long as there

are
elections at ,Davidson that there
will be combines, outside as well’as
inside the fraternity. If the stu-
dent council cannot handle voting
properly,a board of elections would
seem to be a good thing, but I do
not think they can break the tra-

ditiogal: combines.
Bill Hamilton, Junior:

I am heartily in favor of The
Davidsonian’s proposed plan for a
representative board to govern poli-
tics. It seems to me that board of

this ‘type would eliminate much~of+}

“dirty” politics that is constantly
coming before us and would do
much to avoid hard feelings be-
tween the fraternities in the sup-
port of different candidates.

As I it, the board should

have entire control of elections and

see

the student council relieved of any
say so or control whatsoever. They
have enough to keep them busy
without this. I think that the board
should publish before elections
their interpretation of cliques
combines and have some rule apply-
ing to group “understandings” a-
mong non-fraternity men. They
should also publish their entire set
of rules and prohibitions with the
corresponding penalties and these
should be subjected to the vote of
the student body before they be-
come final.

It seems to me that the com-
plete and entire attendance of mem-
bers should be required before any
action on the part of the board
be undertaken. They should also
keep .records of all actions
these be open to investigation
when questioned.

Kyser Wilson, Sophomore:

If the honor system works
completely as we think it does we
Should need no ballot-box guards.
Nevertheless, I think %t is a good
idea. Seriously, I believe it is a
good idea to have one board to
check the ballots, prevent combines,
and otherwise supervise elections
all the way through.
Herbert Codington, Junior:
~The plan as proposed by The
Davidsonian for a board of elec-
tions appears to be a satisfactory
means for curbing any evils of the
old system. This committee will
not have powers in the sense of
the student council, but will be a
committee for the prevention of
any acts in violation of the present
system of elections. This commit-
tee could “nip in the bud” such
evils as cliques and combines by
being in closer contact with the
various fraternities and groups to
a much greater extent than the
student council could possibly be.
It could not hurt to try such a plan
and through cooperation of the
student body may prove to be the
solution of all problems that have
freed so far in connection with
student elections.
