there was anything that Charlotte could
do for Davidson, please to make it
known to him.

Mr. Bryan had motored up from
Charlotte for a couple of hours to sec
the campus, and as he had an appoint-
ment to speak in Charlotte at 11 o'clock

present to hear the statesman, who was
given a rousing cheer by the student sol-
diers as he departed.

Every week some of us are hearing
from the fellows who are in the camps
or overseas, The Davidsonian is vitally
interested in all Davidson alumni who
are “With the Colors,” and it proposes
to publish from week to week interesting
extracts from the letters of these alumni.
Fellows, The Davidsonian is your pa-
per, to be kept up to its motto, ‘Good,
Clean and Snappy.” You can help make
it such by handing in such extracts to
the editor or any of the staff members.

The following lines are from a letter
written October 2 by William Love, ex-
’20, who enlisted in May i in the Marines
and is now “over there.” They remind
us of William’s humor of old:

“We sailed from a certain port in the
U. S. and after a certain number of days
we arrived at a certain French port and
thence to a certain. camp where we now
are. France is a pretty nice place when
the sun shines, but when it rains you
get lost in the mud. This i is the dry
season now, it rains only six days i in the
week, In the rainy season it rains eight
days in the week.”

Corps, American Expeditionary
Forces, France.

Mrs. Spink was ushered by Jane into
a friend’s house for an afternoon call,
and, as she stood in the hall a voice call-
ed softly down from somewhere above:

“Jane, if that’s Mrs. Spink, I’m not
at home.”

The caller lifted her head sharply. “It
is Mrs. Spink,” she shouted, “and she’s
mighty glad to hear it.”—Ex.
