Today we are gonna ‘take a walk

through our college campus:
Colaba Rides “Dan ‘xen "way ”

that? Sure you can, Now isn’t. it
a wonderful day!

Do you notice all the wooden
stakes that are driven in the
ground? Sure you do. There are
some over there. These stakes
have been placed there by the
little men who work for the
college. The purpose of the
stakes is to trip students who
try to run on the grass.

See over there, a young
freshmint has just implanted
his face in the soil after making

contact with the_little wooden.

peg. You must realize that these
stakes were not just driven into
the campus earth in a hap-
hazard fashion, but: the men
who placed them there looked
through baby ‘telescopes to
determine the most strategic
locations.

Did you see those bushes by
the walkway in front of the
dorms? Sure you did. But
please do not stare at them, for
they have had their photosyn-
thetic heads shaved by the men
who work for the college cam-
pus. Now these poor monoco-
tyledons stand naked in the
cruel winter mornings, after-
noons, and nights. And for
what reason? Did you ask
yourself for what reason? Sure
you did. And now we will tell
you as we continue our walk
through the college campus.

Hey, did you see that leaf fall
to the ground? Well, I guess
you missed it. What happened
was that a small leaf from that
tree over there (you know, the
tree in front of the Fine Arts
Building with the distinguished
masculine look) fell to the
ground and was picked up
instantaneously by one of the
little men who work for the
college campus.

If you will look closely, then
you will see this occurring time
and time again. But, you will
never see a leaf on the floor of
the college campus unless it is

in a pile with other leaves and -

placed there by the little men
who work for the college cam-
pus.

Well, boys and girls, we sure
did enjoy our little walk. But,
we are really becoming bored by
all this crap, and our Bic is
about to run dry. So, rendereth
unto the IMAC report.

This week’s IMAC report
centers on basketball (not ba-
bies, Tom-TSEB-s.). Most of

If you're starting to look at life after
college, try our “basic” outlook. Apply
for the special Two-Year Army ROTC
Program during your sophomore
year. Attend a six-week Basic Camp
this summer and earn $500. It's
tough. But the people who can
manage it are the people we want to
serve as officers in the active Army
or Reserves. Do well at Basic and
you can qualify for the Army ROTC
Advanced Program in the fall. You'll
earn $100 a month for 20 months
your last two years in college. And
the opportunity for a two-year full
tuition scholarship. You'll also receive
the extra credentials that will
distinguish you in whatever career
you may choose. Try our “basic”
outlook on life.
