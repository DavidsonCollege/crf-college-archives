Hero's honey hopes,
longs for lover's lips

By JACK GOLDEN
Staff Writer

Looking out over the vacant
sea, her longing grew deeper.
The months they had been
separated seemed to pass more
quickly than did this day. She
dreamed of letting herself fall
into his arms as soon as his
ship was berthed.

Why did he not return to
her? He was due in port
yesterday. Doubt started
creeping into her conscious-
ness. No, she mustn’t think
like that. Whirling on her high
heels, she went into the house
and up the steps to her room.
She must not think of him
until he has returned. Besides
she must hurry if she is to be
ready to find another lover.

Those poor unfortunate cre-
atures of the silver screen are
our subjects.

Kathy Black and Catesby
Jones, a married duo from
Boston, will bring their show
of music and conversation to
the 900 Room this week,
playing two shows tonight,
Friday and Saturday nights.

The pair, who also played a
show after the game last night
and who gave an impromptu
concert in front of Belk Tues-
day afternoon, describe their
act as consisting of ‘original

Black and Jones perform this week

music and innovative versions
of other musician’s work.”’

They also stress a good audi-
ence rapport in their program.

Featuring just their two
guitars and voices, Black and
Jones have been playing at
clubs in Boston for over a year
and have recently begun a
national college tour.

Black, who hails from Mich-
igan, has a voice which is
equally at home in folk, blues,

and funkier styles of music;
her husband, originally from
Kentucky, is mainly a guitar-
ist, but his voice is also
impressive and blends well
with his wife’s.

About their music, the pair
says “through our music and
performance we are trying to
help others to find the freedom
of expression that enables one
to attain self-acceptance and
fulfillment...a goal we seem to
be chasing eternally.”’

Old and new ways conflict in ‘Lies’

By PATRICK COVINGTON
Staff Writer
The conflict between the old way

many twentieth-century stories, as it
illustrates the disorientation of mod-

ern man brought about by rapidly

advancing technology. This theme is’

often personalized by showing the
relationship between two people rep-
resenting different generations and
different ways of looking at things.

This conflict is the basis of Lies My
Father Told Me. The film is based on
a short story by the Canadian writer
Ted Allan, which, since it first
appeared in print, has also been
transformed into a radio play and a
television show. This latest incarna-
tion as a film was directed by the
Czech filmmaker Jan Kadar froma
screenplay by Allan.

At first the film seems to be a
typical, almost stereotyped piece of
modern romanticism: a young boy
and his idealistic grandfather are
trapped in the environment of Jewish
ghetto in Montreal in the 1920’s. But,
as the film continues, the idyllic mood
becomes undermined by a squalid
realism which becomes more and more
assertive, and the degree of its
strength ultimately leaves one quest-
ioning the motives of the artists and
the integrity of the film itself.

The problem could be stated in
terms of the title: who is actually
lying? The title refers to the feelings
of the young boy, and it is primarily
from his viewpoint that we see the

action of the film. The father “‘lies’’ to
the boy (or so the boy thinks) through
his pragmatic, capitalistic nature.

He is an inventor, which in itself is
not pragmatic, but he thinks of his
inventions in terms of money. His
negative image is reinforced through
the somewhat ludicrous nature of his
inventions: things like creaseless
trousers and expandable cufflinks.

The house in which the boy and
grandfather live along with the father
and mother (the latter the grandfath-
er’s daughter) is a drab environment
of differing shades of brown; the film
takes on an almost monochromatic
aspect in the interior scenes. Family
life is frantic: nobody listens to
anybody else, and there are few
sentences completed without an inter-
ruption.

In contrast, the scenes in which the
boy and the grandfather are out alone
on the grandfather’s wagon (he is a
rags-and-bottles merchant) are filmed
in vibrant color. We see long shots of
the wagon rolling through a park
while, over the soundtrack we hear

the grandfather answering the boy’s

Lies My Father Told Me

metaphysical questions in Talmudic
language.

Kadar and his cinematographer
Paul Van Der Linden have a strong
feeling for the idyllic, and it is these
scenes with their visual richness and
brightness which are the highlights of
the film.

But reality encroaches, and, as it
does, the film’s basic conflict becomes
clear. In a moment of euphoria the
grandfather capitulates to some de-
gree to the father, and the boy’s faith
begins to crumble. It is renewed for a
short period, but then suddenly, the
grandfather is gone.

However, if the grandfather’s way
of looking at things is the true way,
then his influence on the boy should
be strong enough to keep his spirit
alive. But that is not the feeling which
is conveyed: as the film ends, the boy,
who is hiding, sees a tableau of the
grandfather and his wagon that fades

from brilliant hues to the dull brown,

of an old photograph.

’ In addition, the stable where the
grandfather keeps his horse has been
changed, notably, into an antique

shop. The father’s last line is,
“There’s going to be some changes

\ made around here’’; one gets the

feeling both that he means it and that

ithe changes are not of a positive

nature. The boy, hiding in a loft and
looking at the harsh, snow-covered
streets through a swinging door, is

’ left utterly alone.

Perhaps all this is just Allan and
Kadar attempting to be realistic. But
even so, the ultimate mood of the film
clashes with what had earlier been the
dominant mood. It is as if we had
been seeing the harshness of the world
through a filter that. had been
suddenly taken away, and that the
view had not enriched us but rather
deluded us, leaving us frightened and
ineffectual.

Whatever the motive for this effect,
the film has to be counted as a
powerful and high-quality work. The
performances are excellent, with
Yossi Yadin very convincing as the
grandfather. The performance of Jeff-
rey Lynas as the young boy is notable
for its frankness: here we have not the
lovable Shirley Temple-style tyke,
but rather a realistic six-year-old who
is sometimes selfish and hateful.

As I’ve tried to indicate, Allan and
Kadar have undertaken a risky ende-
avor with this film. Perhaps my reac-
tion to its content is highly arbitrary
and unfair; at any rate, Kadar and
Allan should at least be credited with
facing the issue which they raised
instead of hiding behind pure ideal-
ism.
