Poll Examines Opinion
On Religious Activities

Through the expressed interest
of UCM and YMCA council mem-
bers and particularly emphasized
campus meetings, the problem of
religious emphasis among the stu-
dent body was chosen by the
Oavidsonian as the subject of this
month’s student opinion poll.

This poll was conducted by 23
reporters from all four classes,
gathered cross-section opinion from
approximately 50% (400) of the
student body, and covered all six
dormitories, the Village, Carolina
Inn, Guest House, and six town
residences.

ODK Plans Program
To Inform Students

Leighton McCutchen, president
of Omicron Delta Kappa, has an-
nounced that this honorary frater-
nity is implementing a program to
inform Davidson students about the
uthletic policy of the college.

ODK is presenting this informa-
tion in the hope that the student
body, with a better understanding
of Davidson's athletic policies, will
be able to think more intelligently
and responsibly about the problem
of subsidized or non-subsidized
athletics.

In order to carry out this pro-
gram, ODK has accumulated facts
revealing the Davidson athletic
policy and those responsible for
making it. These facts will be
presented soon to the student body
through panels, fact forums and
newspaper articles. ODK will also
act as a channel through which
student opinion, now better in-
formed, will be carried to the
policy-makers.

This plan by ODK is to fulfill
its purpose as an organization
which attempts to make students
think more clearly and wisely
about Davidson problems.

Wagoner Designs Shrine

Harold E. Wagoner, architect of
the Davidson Presbyterian Church,
has another laurel added to his
growing reputation as a leading
designer of churches and religious
edifices in America today.

Avizones Highways devoted its
March 1954 issue in toto to the
proposed construction of a Shrine
of the Ages to be located on the
south rim of the Grand Canyon.

Shrine of the Ages—the canyon
itself has long stood as a silent
witness to the forces of eternity
and God, where men and women
of all faiths have worshipped God
in the splendor and beauty of the
natural expanse of the yawning
chasms.

The chapel to be constructed
under the direction of Mr. Wago
ner will hold in reverence the land
of mountains as a place for wor-
ship, for meditation, and for in-
spiration in finding answers to the
problems of life that confuse men.
It will stand as a monument to
the birth of a new devotion to
religion and as an example of a
new understanding of human
brotherhood and the fatherhood
of God.

This is more than another reli-
gious shrine. The chapel situated
op the edge of this vast horizon
symbolizes America’s godliness,
reverence and her respect for hu-
man personality.

Unique problems of design

his task. National Park Service

only in the summer months and
consequently contribute only when
at home.

On the basis of figures obtained
from the Y office, students gave
an average of $3.00 to Vespers in
1953-54 with certain allowances
made for faculty and visitors.

policies prohibit the separation of
individual retreats of religious
worship. Therefore it was neces-
sary to abolish the outward sym-
bols associated with Protestant,
Catholic, and Jewish churches. In-
stead one finds the clean lines of
a circular auditorium and adjoin-
ing studies, conference rooms an
lounges composing the modernistic
structure. One senses the graceful
elegance of this shrine to a house
of God in which brothers of all
faiths may assemble as he ap
proaches the main entrance where
a granite statue of Moses and the
burning bush will set apart the
essence of a common faith and
heritage.

Inside the chapel the problems
of dealing with sacraments and ar-
rangements of three faiths were
ingeniously solved by hydraulic
lifts located beneath the main floor
of the auditorium. At the touch
of a switch, the attendant may
shift altars as the occasion arises
to facilitate the mechanics of ful-
filling the needs of all worship

serves the dual role as an extra

OR. CARL PRITCHETT

Dr. Carl Pritchett
Speaks af Vespers

Dr. Carl R. Pritchett, pastor of
the First Presbyterian Church in
Anderson, S. C., will speak at
vespers this Sunday night.

Born in Salisbury, he was reared
in Reidsville, N.C. He received
his A.B. degree from Davidson
College in 1930. Following his
graduation, Mr. Pritchett remained
at Davidson for two years to serve
as YMCA secretary. :

In the fall of 1932, he entered
Union Theological. Seminary at
Richmond, Va., where he took the
regular three-year course. He was
awarded the Hoge Fellowship and
studied there an extra year, receiv:
ing his B.M. and Th. M. degrees.

He accepted a call to Smithfield
in 1936 and remained there until
1940 when he came to Davidson
to become pastor of the Presby-
terian Chirch.

Serving as pastor in Davidson
until the summer of 1952 when
he accepted hi8 call to Anderson,
Dr. Pritchett had a fruitful minis-
try both to his congregation, made
up of town’s people and college
administrators, and also to the stu-
dents .attending Davidson College.

Dr. Pritchett is married to the
former Miss Anna Montgomery of
Reidsville. They have four daugh-
ters: Mary Anna, Peggy, Dorothy
and Betty.

Library Janitress,
Percy Scales, Dies

Perey Scales, janitress of the
college library when it was lo-
cated in the present Guest House,
died last week in Davidson. She
had reached an advanced age and
was widely respected by both her
white and her colored friends.

For nearly a quarter of a cen-
tury, Percy was in the employ of
Davidson College. She did her
work in the library before the
students arrived so that few of
them knew her, but it is the
opinion of those for whom she
worked that the college never had
a more faithful and loyal employee.

Union to Show More
Movies In the Future

In a meeting yesterday after-
noon the Film Committee of the
Union voted to increase its film
presentations as a result of the
burning of the local theatre and
the sincere request by a large
number of students that more films
be shown in the Union.

It was decided that films will be
shown on Tuesday, Wednesday,
Friday, and Saturday of each week
when nothing else has been sched-
uled on the college calendar for
these days.

The film committee operates on
a volunteer basis, with each mem-
ber contributing his time. To
avoid having anyone spending too
much time working with the
movies, Jerry Helms, committee
chairman, announced that the size
of the committee will be increased.
He requests that anyone who is in-
terested in helping the committee
contact him or the Union Office.
Several boys have already offered
their services.

The committee plans to continue
its present type of films. There
is to be no increase in admission.
The presentations will be open to
any member of the college family
and his guests.

Helms said yesterday, “We will
continue to act on this basis, show-
ing two films on four days each
week, unless too much time is in-
volved by the students on the com-
mittee. We do not want ahy mem-

Lt. Col. B. C. Hassett \Loy States Changes | 46
‘Visits ROTC Dept.

Lt. Col. Burrell C. Hassett, of
the Department of the Army, Of-
fice of the Executive for Reserve
and ROTC Affairs in Washington,
D. C., made a tour of inspection
of the Davidson College Reserve
Officers Training Corps last Wed-
nesday.

On hand to welcome Lt. Col.
Hassett to the Davidson campus
on behalf of the college were Dr.
John R. Cunningham, President,
Dr. C. J. Pietenpol, Dean of the
Faculty, Dr. Samuel R. Spencer,

_| Dean of Students, and Lt. Col. John

D. Sapp, Professor of Military
Science and Tactics.

The purpose of Lt. Col. Hassett's
visit was to discuss ROTC matters
with the PMS&T and college ad-
ministration. At the same time he
conducted an informal inspection
of the operation, training and ad-
ministration of the Davidson
ROTC unit.

The tour of inspection began at
8:45 a.m., Wednesday morning in
the office of the ROTC Depart.
ment with a briefing of Lt. Col.
Hassett, Dr. Cunningham, Dr.
Pietenpol, and Dr. Spencer on the
operation, training’ and administra-
tion of the Davidson cadet corps
by the regimental staff. The regi-
mental staff is composed of Cadet
Col. Cortez A. Cooper, Cadet Maj.
Robert Kimbrough, Cadet Maj.
Jeter H. Abernathy, Cadet Maj.
Floyd Feeney, and Cadet Captain
Austin Strand.

To Be in Annual

Swain Loy, editor of Quips ‘n
Cranks, says that this year’s an-
nual will contain some striking
changes from Davidson annuals of
the past.

The entire book has been recon-
structed with the idea of present-
ing events in both a logical and
chronological order.

The book will have an archi-
tectural theme and will contain
many examples of modern design.
The sections will be arranged to
present events in such a way that
the reader ten years from now will
be able to remember what went on
during the year and not simply
the organizations he was in.

YOUR YEAR

One of this year’s innovations
will be a thirty-five-page section
entitled, “Your Year.” It will pre-
sent the events of fall, winter, and
spring, as they occurred, without
separating such things as sports
into separate sections, as in the
past.

The annual will be divided into
seven sections as follows: Faculty
and Administration, Your Year,
Beauty Section, Activities (YMCA,

Literary Societies, Davidsonian,
ete.), Honorary Fraternities,
Classes, and Social Fraternities.

The purpose of this arrangement
of the sections is to give more
emphasis to the events of the year
than to the sections which ore
filled with rows of individual pic-
tures.

Philanthropic Initiates
51 Into Membership

The Philanthropic Literary
Society held its meeting Monday
night, Feb. 22, for the purpose of
initiating new members. After
the initiation, President Malcolm
Williamson spoke briefly to the
new initiates about their responsi-
bilitics as bearers of the ancient
and honorable tradition of the
Philanthropic Society.

In the following order of busi-
ness, President Williamson ap-
pointed Allie Cone as chairman of
the Graveyard Committee. An im-
portant committee which has not
functioned since 1892, this group
has as its duty the preservation,
protection and defense of the tradi-
tions interred in the Davidson
Cemetery.

Jim Kuist was appointed chair-
man of a committee to investigate
the contents of the Philanthropic
Society’s desk which has held
the records of the society ever
since its inception in 1837.

INITIATES

The new members, initiated in
the shadow of the flickering
candies of the Napoleonic chande-
lier, are: S. Curtis Patterson,
Samuel B. Mendenhall, James G.
Boyce, Dewitt F. Roper, James C.

Blood Drive Dates
Set for April 6, 7

On April 6 and 7, the Davidson
College student body once again
has an opportunity to contribute
its blood to the Red Cross blood
drive.

In Mecklenburg County alone
approximately 900 pints of blood
are donated through the Red Cross
to those who need it. The Red
Cross assures us that the blood
will be used in the county.

Last fall only 210 pints were
given and the  Interfraternity
Council is requesting a better turn
out for this painless process.

All students under 21 must have
signed releases from their
parents. To speed up and expedite
a somewhat awkward process, the
council is sending out double post-
cards. The parents will tear off
the unused portion and return ft,
allowing the student to give blood.

Constitution Passes

The revised Constitution of Student Government was
adopted in this mornings balloting by a vote with outside mar-
gins, of 547 to 39, and 565 to 20 on the various articles. Stu-
dent Government President Floyd Feeney released these
figures at noon today as the Committee on Constitutional Re-
vision completed its work of several months.

There was but a smattering of con votes on an issue with
which the Student Body showed amazing familiarity. President
Feeney indicated that he was well pleased with both the in-
terest shown on the part of students and with the outcome of
the voting.

In a statement to the Davidsonian early this afternoon
Feeney said that he was hopeful that the Constitution would
provide for more effective student government. Its opera-

tion, however, will depend upon the continued interest and
cooperation of the Student Body, he pointed out.

The revision, which has been in progress under a com-

mittee headed by Perrin Anderson since September, involved
major changes in such articles as Number Nine on student
body regulations, in additions of such articles as Number Ten
on Trial Procedure, and omission of several outdated articles,

including those organizing the Student Store Board of Di-
rectors, the Point System Committee, the Student-Faculty Con-

ference Committee and the Student Sports Publicity Office.

CONTRAST TO ARMSTRONG:

Modern Jazz Concert Set

By BILL RAWSON

With the announcement of the
Dave Brubeck Concert for March
10, the Interfraternity Council bas
provided an interesting sequel and
contrast to its presentation of
Louis Armstrong on February 14.
These two artists are at opposite
extremes in this music called jazz.

Louis represents the free-
wheeling, hot jazz commonly called
Dixieland, while Dave Brubeck is
a “king pin” in the progressive or
modern movement. The former is a
loud emotional type of improvised
music performed from the heart
by musicians of talent but little
training; the latter is a more sub-
dued music which retains the free
improvising but which is per-
formed by highly trained tech-
nicians who often borrow techni-
ques from the classical field.

There are those who prefer one
of these types of jazz to the ex-
clusion of the other, but it would
be hard to deny that much en-
joyment can be had from either.

While similar in some respects
to the jazz of Armstrong, the music
of Brubeck is in other respects as
different as night and day, so let's
take a look at what is coming up
on March 10.

NATIVE CALIFORNIAN

Dave Brubeck was born in Con-

cord, California. His father was a

mother taught piano. As a result
of the later, music lessons came
early for Dave and he earned his
first money playing hymns in a
school. He wanted to follow his
father’s footsteps as a rancher and
went to the College of the Pacific
intending’ to be a rancher; but
music soon got the best of him.

After a tour in the Army, Bru-
beck enrolled in Mills College,
where he studied under France's
{famed Darius Milhaud and received
his M.A. Teacher Milhaud filled
him with counterpoint (a melody
added to a given melody as ac-
companiment) and _ polytonality
(two or more simultaneous keys)
and fired him with the conviction
that improvisation of jazz was as
valid for him as the improvisation
of toceatas and fugues was for
Bach.

“He told me,” says Dave, “If I
didn’t stick to jazz, 'd be working
out of my own field and not tak-
ing advantage of my American
heritage.” Thus Brubeck has
undertaken to show that jazz is
music.

QUARTET FORMED 195)
The Dave Brubeck Quartet was
formed in 1951 and has survived
with few changes in personnel.
Dave is at the piano, Paul Desmond
plays alto sax, and Bob Bates is on

Presbyterian cattle-rancher and his poss, with Joe Dodge on drums.

Sean O'Casey Play
Scheduled Tomorrow

By 0. 4. OGDEN

Friday and Saturday, February
25 and 26, the Dublin Players will
give two performances here in con-
junction with the Davidson College
Artist Series. Friday at 8:15 p.m.,
they will present Noel Coward's
most famous play, “Blithe Spirit,”
and Saturday afternoon at 3
o'clock “Juno and the Paycock”
by Sean O’Casey will be performed.

Noel Coward is considered to be
the most representative of the
British playwrights that emerged
after World War I. “Blithe Spirit”
is a hilarious comedy, set in the
home of novelist Charles Con-
domine, when he is living happily
with his second wife. By accident
a medium conjures up the ghost
of Elvira, Charles’ first wife, whom
Charles can see. How Charles copes
with his two “wives” gives us the
smash hit of London, Broadway,
and Dublin stages which has be-
come a classic in the modern thea-
tre.

Sean O’Casey is recognized as
the greatest living dramatist of
the Irish theatre and his “Juno
and the Paycock” is one of the
finest dramas of this era. The
play deals with the everyday life
of the Boyle family in Ireland dur-
ing the 1922 terror of civil war.
We have their hopes and disap-
pointments, their laughter and
their tears in this picture of the
couroge, imagination and faith of
the Irish people—". . . poetic, high.
voltage realism.”

Students will be admitted to
both performances upon presenta-
tion of their identification cards.
Admission price is $2. Both plays
will be given in Chambers Audi-
torium.

The Dublin Players performed at
Davidson last year, at which time
they presented George Bernard
Shaw's “Pygmalion.”

In connection with this presen-
tation of the Artist Series, there
is a showing of drawings by John
Rembert in the lobby of Chambers
building. For full details of this
exhibition, please turn to page
three.

SVM Discusses Religion

Sam Magill, general secretary
of the YMCA, will lead off in a
discussion of the place of Chris-
tianity at Davidson in an SVM
meeting to be held after Vespers
Sunday ‘in. the Student Lounge at
the Church. Students are urged
to attend the discussion. ‘

The going was slow at first, but
in a matter of four years, Brubeck
fans have grown from a small West
Coast clique to a coast-to-coast
crowd—particularly on college
campuses.

Today, the Quartet confines its
playing to night clubs and occa-
sional concert tours, with a large
percentage of the concerts being
presented at colleges. The world-
ly success of the group can be
measured by the fact that ‘Dave
Brubeck at 33 made $100,000 last
year.

In regards to the music the
Brubeck Quartet puts out, Dave
himself once remarked that ‘the
challenge is to improvise on 2
known theme, using with taste the
most advanced ideas of our times
without losing the drive and
rhythmic complexity. of early
jazz." Thus Brubeck’s music goes
to the head and heart more than
the feet, and demands the atten-
tion of the audience. It is tre-
mendously complex, but free. It
flows along, improvising constant.
ly, and yet it is held together by
a firm pattern. .

Whether it be “Stardust” or “On
the Alamo,” the melody usually
appears only in the opening and
closing with Brubeck and Desmond
buifding from there while Dodge
and Bates lay down the rhythmic
foundation.
