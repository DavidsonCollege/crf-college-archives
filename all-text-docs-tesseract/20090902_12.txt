Wildcats step right into
fire in opener at #11 Elon

Ray FRANCIS

The Davidson College football
team will open its season on Sep-
tember 5 when the Wildcats travel
up Interstate-85 to challenge the
Elon Phoenix.

The Wildcats will look to elim-
inate the memory of last year’s
4-7 (3-5 in the Pioneer Football
League) campaign, a season that
was largely undone by injuries and
turnovers (19 interceptions proved
especially costly).

The Wildcats have a chance to
set a program record for victories
in a decade. Davidson has won 47
games since the year 2000, and
three victories this season would
set a new standard of excellence
for the Wildcats. The decade was
started on a note of perfection as
the 2000 team went 10-0, and this
year’s team will look to finish the
decade on a positive note.

The main question on offense
will be how the Wildcats will re-
place last year’s starting quarter-
back Ryan Alexander ’09. Alexan-
der obliterated the school records
for career passing yardage and
touchdowns last season, setting fig-
ures of 9,376 and 72, respectively.
Michael Blanchard *1] appears to
have the inside track to take over
the starting position.

With Blanchard taking the
snaps, the Wildcat offense will
show a spread-option look at times,
taking advantage of Blanchard’s
abilities as a runner in contrast to
Alexander’s pocket-passing per-
sona. Also figuring into the mix is
Matt Heavner 712, a more station-
ary gunslinger.

The Wildcats will return two
powerful weapons at running back
this year in Justin Wilhams 711
and Kenny Mantuo °11. Mantuo,
the stronger of the two, scored
10 touchdowns last season while
the speedy Williams averaged 5.6
yards per carry. Williams, whom
Coach Tripp Merritt has compared
to Reggie Bush, will also return
kicks and be featured as a slot re-
ceiver. He had a 98-yard kickoff
return for a touchdown against San
Diego last year.

The Wildcat receiving corps
will look to offset the loss of Kirk
Konert ’09 and Myles Potter ’09
from last year’s team. Konert led
the Wildcats in touchdowns, receiv-

ing yards and receptions last year
with six, 692 and 53, respectively.
The team will look to fill the void
with the contributions of Andrew
Aldrich 710 and Mark Hanabury
11, who combined for 77 recep-
tions and 978 yards last season.

The offensive line will be an-
chored by four seniors, including
Mark lafrate °10, who was named
to the Preseason All-PFL First
Team. Joining Iafrate will be Jason
Perillo ’10, Joe Tabler ’10, Shane
Purvis ’10, Marshall Ellis ’11 and
Zenus Wilson 11.

The Davidson women’s field
hockey team opened their season
with two games this weekend on
Belk Turf Field against the non-
conference opponents of Ball State
on Saturday and Sacred Heart on
Sunday. ‘

The team looked strong in both
match-ups. Unfortunately, they lost
against Ball State who defeated the
Wildcats 2-1, with a game-winning
shot late in the second half. David-
son returned to the field on Sunday
and achieved its first win of the
season by defeating Sacred Heart
2-1with impressive defensive play
and a dominant offense.

In Saturday’s game, Brooke
Macgillivary of Ball State was first
to score, but less than one min-
ute later Davidson’s forward Ellie
Szykowny 11 tied the game with
her first goal of the season. The
game remained tied until the end of
the second half when Hannah Jones
of Ball State scored the game win-
ning shot in the 47th minute.

In the match against Sacred
Heart, Finley Amato ’13 scored her
first and game winning goal off her

own rebounded shot. Throughout
the game, Amato had four shots on
goal topping all other teammates in
shot attempts. “Finely is an excel-
lent athlete and will come in with
one of the strongest hits on the
team. She plays a fast paced game
and is a great presence on the field.

With a relentless attitude, Finley
will undoubtedly be an impact
player for the Wildcats,” Coach
Sutton commented.

The women’s soccer team
opened their 2009 campaign with a
trifecta of tough road games against
top-notch Division-1 competition.
In the first contest versus Win-
throp, the ’Cats pulled out a solid
3-1 decision, but they fell short
last weekend against NC State and
UNC-Wilmington.

The squad ventured to Rock
Hill, SC on Aug. 28 to face the
Winthrop Eagles. This Big South
conference team shares several
opponents with the Wildcats this
fall, and thus provides an excellent
gauge for the team’s position to
open the season.

And fortunately, after a 3-1 vic-
tory, that outlook looks promising.
Just four minutes into the first half,
Stephanie Gerow ’12 found Aman-
da Flink ’11 with a lofted volley in
the six-yard box following a corner
kick from Lauren Conner 710. It

would be the first of two corner set-
ups from the senior.

The ’Cats pounded the Eagle
keepers with 10 shots during the
first period, but when the halftime
whistle sounded, the score still
held 1-0. Still, the Davidson team
maintained all the momentum and
energy heading into intermission.

The Wildcats came out of the
second-half gates with a fury, send-
ing two shots into the back of the
Eagle net within the first ten min-
utes.

For the first score, near the 48th
minute, Gerow knocked another
Conner comer directly into the goal.
Just six minutes later, Blakely Low
’10 ripped a header off the touch of
classmate Kyri Bye-Nagel 710. In
the week prior, Bye-Nagel earned
all-SoCon preseason team honors
for the second year running.

To Winthrop’s credit, the home
team did manage a response goal
in the 58th minute, but it wouldn’t
be enough. The Davidson defense

regained its composure and held
the Eagles to three shots in the sec-
ond period, after only three in the
first. For keepers Jessie Baxa °12
and Loring Ward ’10, the afternoon
provided minimal activity in the
box, each recording one save.

Against the balanced attack
of the Winthrop Eagles, the “Cats
maintained a consistent and domi-
nating presence. But facing a one-
woman assault laid on them by the
NC State Wolfpack, Davidson was
forced to take a defensive stance.
In the game’s first 45 minutes, led
by career performance from Tanya
Cain *12, the Wolfpack unleashed
a 3-0 lead.

It was clearly a different atti-
tude that entered the locker room
from the Saturday before, but for-
tunately, the game didn’t count
for much more than the preseason
preparation. With that perspective
in mind, the ’Cats held their own to
