This Week in Washington | |
Congress turned upside down

By Andrea Short

Political analysts have been
predicting a strong Republican
showing for weeks, but regaining
both the House and Senate major-
ity was beyond even Rush
Limbaugh’ s wildest dreams. Capi-
tol Hill is in flux as incumbent
Democrats receive notice that they
and their staffs must clear out by
December 15, and the Democrats
who remain face a party that lacks
any obvious leadership.

Senator Bob Dole from Kan-
sas is expected to become the new
Senate majority leader in Decem-
ber. He will control only a slight
majority, however, with the Re-
publicans holding 53 seats to the
Democrats 46 (one seat is still un-
decided). His counterpart in the
House will most likely be Repre-
sentative Newt Gingrich from
Georgia.
teacher will preside over 227 Re-
publicans and 199 Democrats
(eight races remain undecided).
Neither the Senate nor the House
contains a Republican majority
strong enough to override presi-
dential vetoes on most issues, but
the Republicans do have the num-
bers to make President Clinton’s
relationship with Congress even

The former history ~

more difficult.

Top Republicans are rejoic-
ing over their new power and
wasted no time in making prom-
ises to the American people. The
chairman of the Republican Sen-
ate campaign committee, Senator
Phil Gramm from Texas, said, “The
American people have given us
the ball. I don’t intend to see us
fumble.” Many of the victorious
Republicans had signed the highly
publicized “Contract with
America;” Republicans designed
this issue platform of tax cuts, a

. Stronger military, a balanced bud-

get, stricter welfare policies, and
term limits to serve as a guarantee
of accountability to the American
people.

While the Republicans eagerly
plan for January, Democrats are
pondering how the party will look
by then. Having lost the majority
leader, George Mitchell, to retire-
ment and the Speaker of the House,
Tom Foley, to a Republican chal-
lenger, the Democrats are doomed
to some interfighting. Tennessee
was ‘the sight of a major Demo-
cratic defeat as both Rep. Jim Coo-
per and Sen. Jim Sasser, both ris-
ing stars in the party, lost re-
election bids. Sasser had been in

NEWS”

the running for the Senate Major-
ity Leader with Senator Daschle
from South Dakota. Without
Sasser, Daschle may actually face
more opposition than before; some
moderate and conservative Sena-
tors have expressed concern about
handing the leadership to a liberal
Senator, especially in the after-
math of a solid defeat of liberalism
in the election.

The Democratic party is not
only hurt by losing individual lead-
ers, the Democrats that remain in
Congress are decidedly more lib-
eral than the last Congress. This

liberalism, coupled with Republi-

can majority control, could spell
even more gridlock than Congress
experienced last session. Senator
John Breaux of Louisiana, a con-
servative Democrat, said on
Wednesday, “We’re in the same
position in this Congress as the last
Congress. Nobody has 60 votes in
the Senate. we can veto things, and
they can’t override them. They
can block anything we want to
pass. It’s a recipe for gridlock.”

Dean Rusk Program

Refugees visit as part of series

By Graham Ernst

On November 1 in the 900-

Room, a panel of three foreign
refugees from Vietnam and the
former Yugoslavia led an hourlong
discussion with Davidson students
about each refugee’s experiences
and outlooks for the future. The
event was part of this month’s se-
ries on global refugee issues spon-
sored by the Dean Rusk Program.

Nedzad Beciragic fled the cur-
rent civil war in Bosnia-
Herzegovina. ‘He initially went to
Denmark, where he was not al-
lowed a job and was forced to live
off that nation’s welfare system.
He has been in the United States
for two months and is currently in
training to be a pharmacist.

Beciragic provided a power-
ful impact to the discussion when
he said that even after the war was
over, he would never return to his
homeland. He was also skeptical
about the ability of foreign forces,
including the U.S. and the U.N., to
resolve the conflict.

Natasa Mahmutovic also left
the fighting in former Yugoslavia
to come live in the U.S. While she
said she misses her friends, Natasa
claimed that there is no way. to
describe the horror and true suffer-.
ing taking place in her country
today. :

Hung Si Le had been a mem-
ber of the South Vietnamese Army
before he was arrested and impris-
oned by the Communist regime.
With no option to continue living
in Vietnam, Hung is thankful to be
in the United States which has be-
come his “only choice.”

Sponsors were pleased with
the event. Ambassador Jack Perry

Che Davidsonian

was impressed by how the forum
“brought the problem (global refu-
gees) down to three living human
beings.” Ambassador Perry added
that listening to and speaking with
the panel provided a “powerful
emotion” that can not be obtained
by simply reading newspapers or
watching television.

SGA President Eric
Rosenbach, who visited Vietnam
this summer, said that hearing the
real perspectives of people who
are there adds to his understanding
of the current situations in Bosnia
and Vietnam.

Dean Rusk Assistant to Di-
rector Kate Crosman thought the
panel was effective in showing how

past and current tragedies do affect
real people. Furthermore,
Crossman hopes that this series
will raise the general awareness of
Davidson students about the grow-
ing global refugee crisis. With
more than 23 million refugees
worldwide, it is clear that this is an
issue that is not going away in the
near future.

The Dean Rusk Refugee Is-
sues series continues with William
Lee from the UN Relief and Works
Agency, who will speak about his
work in the Middle East tonight.
The series wilf conclude on No-
vember 21 when field workers from
the Red Cross share their experi-
ences in working with refugees.

Pygmy Hedgehogs

Since pygmy hedgehogs have passed pot-bellied pigs as the new hog
on the block, pet-store owners predict a rush of Christmas sales. And
animal shelters expect a springtime rush of returns.

The worries the U.S. Humane Society’s Ken White. “Hedge-
hogs,” he says, “are somewhat burrowing animals that are nocturnal.
They are not well-suited to a 15-gallon enclosure in your kid’s
bedroom.”

His concern: “Exotic (animals) are given up (when) people get
tired of the novelty and are stuck with the responsibility.”

Imaging Labs of Vancouver, Canada, is a service that scans a photo-
graph into a computer and then alters it electronically. The gap can
then be filled by a new partner. The technology can also make people
thinner, younger, and can remove double chins or scars. according to
company president Keith Guelpha, one customer was a man about to
be married. ‘“‘He had gone traveling around Europe before becoming
engaged. There was a different girl in each photo and he wanted them
all removed.”

Reagan

Former President Ronald Reagan has Alzheimer’s disease, an incur-
able brain disorder that causes senile dementia.

Reagan’s doctors said today that the 83-year-old ex-president is
entering the early stages of the progressive brain disease.

“Over the past 12 months, we began to notice from President
Reagan’s test results symptoms indicating the possibility of early
stage Alzheimer’s disease. Additional testing and an extensive
observation over the past few weeks have led us to conclude that
President Reagan is entering the early stages of this disease,” the
doctors wrote. °

Alzheimer’s is a progressive, irreversible neurological disorder.
Symptoms include memory loss, impairment of judgement, disorien-
tation and personality change, among others.
