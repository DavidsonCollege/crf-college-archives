Last year an attempt was
made to form a lacrosse club,
but poor organization caused
it to fold. This spring, the
program has been well organ-
ized and its enthusiastic mem-
bers seem anxious to make it
succeed.

Last Friday, the Davidson
club lacrosse team lost a 5-0
decision to an experienced
Guilford team.

Davidson was without a
coach, but nonetheless fought
hard in a scoreless first half.

In the second half, most of
the Davidson players seemed

THE RIFLE TEAM is aiming for the top.

best finish in recent years.

Davidson narrowly defeated
a psyched up William and
Mary team by a score of 2,625
to 2,621 points. The Wildcats
also defeated Eastern Carolina
University and Southern Con-
ference newcomer, the Univer-
sity of Tennessee at Chatta-
nooga.

Led by Team Captain Tom
Miller with a 267, Davidson
set a team record with four
shooters in the 260’s.

Senior Ben Simms posted a
264. Sophomores Tom Niblock
and Katherine Whitney shot
scores of 262 and 261, respec-
tively.

Rounding out Davidson's
top five was freshman John
Parham with a 258. Senior
Rob Mitchell captured the
number six slot with a 253.

The Wildcats came away
from the match with a season
record now at 18-8-1, already
well past last year’s 13-10

mark.

On Saturday, April 2, Dav-
idson will host the Western
Carolina Conference Tourna-
ment. The eight participating
schools will be: Davidson,
Appalachian State, Clemson
University, South Carolina
State, Furman, Wake Forest,
Wofford and Presbyterian.

Bolstered by the emergence
of several outstanding fresh-
man shooters»the Wildcats
expect to do very well.

to tire and Guilford was able
to capitalize on their mistakes.

Midfielder Alex Evans com-
mented, ‘‘Guilford has a coach
and practices every day. I
think their conditioning just
wore us down.”’

But it was obvious that the
team's spirit was not dam-
pened after the game. In fact,
most of the players seemed
quite pleased with their ef-
forts.

Freshman Bill Mebane re-
mirked, ‘“‘Although we would
have liked to have won, I
think our defense was strong
and if we can generate a little
offense next time, we could
win.

‘‘As it was, we only prac-
ticed five times before this
game with the whole team
together.”

Evans added that the game
was especially enjoyable for
the players, who were eager

for the chance to play, having
run into a lot of red tape before
the season started.

Senior Mike Robinson men-
tioned that problems such as
scheduling, uniforms, refer-
ees, and field conflicts dis-
couraged the team a little at
first. Some were not sure it
would all work out.

These problems are mostly
behind the team now, though,
and the players are ready to
play.

Against Guilford, several
players turned in stellar defen-
sive performances. Both
George Cornelson and Mark
Armstrong provided the
needed muscle, while fresh-
man goalie Tommy Thompson
turned in a tremendous game
with 18 saves.

Commenting on the crowd,
Evans pointed out that the
team really appreciated the
fine turnout.
