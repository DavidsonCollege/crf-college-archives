Side Line Shots

By P. R. Alderman

There are many All-State teams picked
by all sorts of people on one basis or an-
other according to their particular fancy.

Some men are chosen for flashes of bril-
liant play throughout the season while
others are picked for consistent playing;
some for outstanding work in several
phases of the game, others for superiority
in one department, etc. Needless to say,

’ prejudice plays its part in naming these
teams also.

On the team named by the writer in
the latter part of this column there
will undoubtedely be names that will
probably not appear on other All-
State squads, but originality counts—
unless it’s too original. And indeed,
there have been some very original
choices in the papers the past few
days; in fact, almost freakish ones.

As far as the pivot position is concerned
there is very little to say in favor of any
candidate but Lipscomb of Carolina. He
has ably taken the place of the Tar
Heels’ outstanding center of last year—
Schwartz. Of four men eligible for one of
the flanks, Jordan, Holt, Fenner and War-
ren, the latter would be my choice. He
has been handicapped this year by playing
on a losing eleven but was one of the best
in the State.

There is something radically wrong
with the All-State team that leaves
Captain Brock of Davidson off of it.
Either somebody failed to read the
newspapers or else didn’t see this
stellar flankman perform. Otherwise
his failure to place on an All-State
pick can only show unusually poor
football judgment, or any kind, as far
as that goes.

Koenig of Carolina is the best tackle in
the state with Williams of Wake Forest
having the edge on Kistler of Duke and
Lepo of State for the other tackle. Far-
ris, Carolina’s All-American candidate,
was not his best this year but is easily
All-State, while the consistent work of
DeCamp of Davidson entitled him to the
other guard. “Shorty” Branch of the Tar
Heels gets quarter without much dispute.
His playing was outstanding.

Joe McCall, high-scorer for the
Wildcats did some of the most spec-
tacular broken-field running seen in
the state this year, while Buie, Duke’s
sensational passer, was probably their
mainstay. Magner, one of Carolina’s
Hundred Backs, gets the Fullback
position. Williams of Elon also de-
serves honorable mention. Following
is the position and school of the

players:

Prospects For Present
Cage Season Bright As
Candidates Begin Work

Four Regulars and Strong Fresh-
men of Last Year Report for
First Practice

With the Duke game and the 1929 grid
season now in the realm of history, the
eyes of all are focused on the coming
cage season, preparation for which has
already been started by capdidates under
the supervision of Coach "Red” Laird for
the present. The latter will have charge
of varsity practice until it is turned over
to Coach “Monk” in the near future.

The first call for varsity prospects found
only one regular missing from last year's
quintet—Calhoun, whose shoes will be

Forty Freshmen Report
To Basketball Practice

Squad Divided to Help Coach Give
__.Men Special Attention
{
When Coach “Red” Laird issued the call
for freshmen basketball aspirants, approxi-

hard to fill although there will be strong
bidders for his vacancy. A veteran on last
year’s team, his work was a_ consistent
and important factor in the successes of
the season.

In view of the potential reserves of a
strong Fresh team of last year, every in-
dication points to a wealth of material on
which to build a quintet that will make
a strong bid for state championship hon-
ors in the race against other state con-
tenders. Captain Johnston, Pritchett, Rusk
and Goodson are regulars who will defend
their positions against about a score of
other aspirants to regular berths on the
quintet,

The first game on the schedule will be
more of the nature of a practice tilt than
anything else, when the Catawba College
squad will be met here on the night of
December 17th. While definite
predictions can be made on the basis of
the “Cats’” work in this contest, it will,
nevertheless, afford an opportunity to
make a brief survey and estimate of their
the future holds

no very

power and what for

them. More important games will be an-'

nounced in a schedule to be published in
a later edition,

mately forty men answered his call, assuring
him a wealth of material as the season draws
near. Due to the unweildiness of this large
squad he was forced to divide it in half, with
practices at different. times. Coach Laird
plans to keep both these squads working
until the Christmas holidays before cutting
either one, assuring each candidate an ample
time to prove to the coach his worth.

Conditioning exercises and simple passing
and shooting plays are the order of the day,
closing the practice with foul or free-throw
practice. former high and _ prep
school stars are showing up well, and there
will be a close fight for every position on the
team, :

Several

After several days of practice Coach Laird
has picked two squads, the decision resting
on their work so far. The following .men
make up the first squad at present: Pierce,
Fleagle, Manson, Wagner, Pearce, Thoma-
son, Baughn, Creech, Mills, Peabody, Clark,
Myers, Bettis, Bernard; Boucher, Rogers,
Steel, Enochs, Coble and Hartsell.
