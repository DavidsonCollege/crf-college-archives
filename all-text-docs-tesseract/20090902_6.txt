Best-selling author Dorothy Allison serves and the McGee Professor of Writing for

Arts & LIVING

the school year. She delivered a lecture Monday night.

By AMELIA MONTGOMERY
Staff Writer

Dorothy Allison, Davidson’s 2009-
10 McGee Professor of Writing began her
reading on Monday night with the following
quotation from one of her novels: “Tell me
something I don’t know.”

Penn, a character in the unpublished
story, utters this phrase with one hand cuffed
to a bench in a Florida police station for
attempting to murder her mother.

Penn’s aunt, who is in the room with her,
listens to her niece’s proposition, and begins to
recount a tale Penn already knows, but swaps
the comical outcome of a trip gone awry in
California to a haunting nightmare. The new,
supposedly factual version provokes Penn’s
realization of the consequences of taking the
wrong path and transforms her anger and
indifference into fear. Her aunt’s powerful
storytelling will hopefully induce Penn to
save her own life.

The aunt in the story and the author that
created her have much in common; Allison’s
words captivated the occupants of the 900
Room just as the aunt’s did Penn.

Her six books include _ bestselling
novels Bastard Out of Carolina (1992) and
Cavedweller (1998), have fascinated readers
across the globe. Allison has accrued such
awards as the ALA Award for Lesbian and
Gay Writing, the Tanner Prize in Ethics from
Stanford University, two Lambda Literary
Awards and the Robert Penn Warren Award
for Fiction.

Allison grew up the daughter of a teen
mother in Greenville, SC and was the first
in her family to graduate from high school
and college. The early feminist movement
highly influenced her writing and gave her
the affirmation she needed. She now lives in

Sonoma County, CA with her partner Alix
and her son.

“I make [my family] into stories all the
time. Sometimes they forgive me,” she said.

It is clear from her standing as a prominent
southern, feminist, queer and working class
writer that her own life experiences highly
influence her work. Allison stresses the
importance of true passion in writing.

Her writing is full of candor and audacity.
In fact, her readers know she often touches
upon uncomfortable subjects, including
Daddy Glen, a brutal stepfather from Bastard
out of Carolina.

Allison asserts that, though she relished
including elements of her own stepfather into
the novel, revenge alone does not make a good
story; a writer must understand a character’s
motives more deeply than a singular focus on
revenge will allow.

The brilliant insight seen in Allison’s
lecture is certainly only the tip of the iceberg
of what her English 204 students stand to
receive this semester.

If you are not fortunate enough to have
add/dropped your way into her class, do
not fret. Allison’s most important advice to
aspiring writers should be relatively easy
to follow: “Write! Make it a source of joy.
Make it a place that you’re happy to go to,”
she said. Also, Allison praises Davidson
students, whom she describes as “passionate
about justice” and “hot and engaged.”

Despite her compliments, it is certain
that the Davidson student body is to have the
privilege of experiencing Dorothy Allison
this semester. Allison unquestionably knows
how to engage both readers and listeners, and
Penn’s reaction at the end of her aunt’s story
could also be used to describe the audience’s
reaction to Allison’s reading: “A hell of a
story, A hell of a story.”
