OFF FROM DAVI

‘Leslie Jacobs, Betty Parks, John
Umhau, Bob Grizzard, Karl Schlot-
terbeck, and ‘Sally Bondurant—saw

away from college.

Furthermore, time away from Dav-
idson often cleared up student career
confusions. While some students fear

returned, it was not very difficult for
most when they weighed the advan-
tages of increased experience against
the minor problems of reorientation.

Most of the students knew what
they would do outside of school before
they left it. The Office of Experiential
Learning helped them with job ar-
rangements, places to stay, and
connections.

- John Umnau

John Umhau visited the Koinonia
Communes of Americus, Georgia,
during fall term 1975. The organiza-
tion is a farm commune located six
miles from Plains, Georgia, and has
long been instrumental in fighting
racism in its area.

Umbhau worked in a peanut factory.
‘I met whole segments of the

American people I wouldn’t have |
(©) otherwise; there is no way for me here
z to meet farmers as another farmer.’’
LL] He summarized how his perceptions ©
of American society had changed. ©

“Through the media we've created in
ourselves expectations for high life-
styles, high living, beautiful women,
happiness all the time without any
hard work. I think we’ve degraded the
joy we get out of a hard day’s work.”’

Bob Grizzard.

Bob Grizzard left spring term 1976
to work in a food processing factory in

X<. Jamaica. He recalls feeling like ‘‘a fish

STUDENTS SP

in a bowl’’ when he first arrived,
because he was one white man among
so many black faces. He listed
wanting time to himself and curiosity
as the two major reasons for leaving
Davidson in the first place. The Office
for Experiential Learning (then the
Career-Service Office under Randy
Kincaid’s direction) helped him set up
the job and living space in Jamaica.

Grizzard commented, “I got a lot
out of it, realizing how minute
Davidson is. It makes it easier to be
content here—not complacent —but
happy here, because you do realize it
is a small place, and that it has its
limitations. By seeing its smallness
you see its qualities; you can take it
for what it is. It’s when you ask
Davidson to be something it’s not
that it gets frustrating.”

Sally Bondurant

Sally Bondurant-went JYA-Eng-
land for a year and then extended her
leave for two. more terms to work as a
barmaid and play semiprofessional

about myself and operate indepen-

" dently, but to get back to the places
and people I'd’been with in a'much |
“ mote objective way.
“T was very confused as to what'my —
own goals were as opposed to others’ |
expectations of me. I wanted to make |
sure I was following my own pur- |
poses. It’s rather selfish I suppose, ”
but I want other people to stop

mucking us over, preaching this un-
selfishness business: we’ve got to sort
ourselves out before we have a firm
basis to give anything to anybody.
And unfortunately anything having
to do with ourselves is labelled as
selfish and seen tively.”

Karl Schlotterbeck

This past winter term, Karl Schlot- n
terback got three independent studiesGetting back into academics?

courses through the Honors College
and a job through the Office for
Experiential Learning. He worked in
Durham, N.C., ina service agency
dealing with the problems of the aged.
This supplements: his interdisciplin-
ary major on aging. He came back on
the weekends to confer with his

_ professors.

He lived in the office building in
which he worked and described his

| existence there as very quiet and

tedious. ‘‘While I was able to cope
quite well with the demands of my life
there, it’s real nice to be back. I
appreciate the chance to interact with
people on all different levels. Out in
the ‘Real World’ I felt I had to
establish myself with a person. There
is more of a time period you have to
spend to get comfortable with them,
to trust each other, to be intimate.

It’s nice to have organized things to
plays, etc. This

Betty Parks worked winter term
1975-76 iri Philadelphia as a part of
the Great Lakes College Association.
Getting full credit for her work, she
spent four days a week in the Center
for Preschool Services with develop-
mentally delayed children, and one
day a week in seminars studying
urban problems.

She found she enjoyed being on her
own. ‘‘Whatever got done I did it. I
found myself wanting to do much
more. Here you’ve got a paper due
Friday. There it was more like I
wanted it done by Friday. It was
totally different not having al! the
external pressures. It really made you
grow up in a hurry...here at Davidson
we are very sheltered.”

Leslie Jacobs

Leslie Jacobs also worked in Phila-
delphia through the GLAA with kids.
She decided on a hospital setting,
working with convalescent children
trying to make the hospitalization
less traumatic. ‘‘A lot of the kids had
parents who worked and couldn’t
visit. When a child can’t move around
much, and he can’t see his own
parents he really needs something to
keep his mind occupied. Our task was
to gain the child’s trust and give him
something fun to do.”

When asked why she left Davidson,
she said, “I was just sick and tired of

hig . There are other kinda of
people in the world, and sometimes

art, who like to
dance, who are not sitting around
reading, who may be into a whole
non-verbal type communication. Peo-
ple like words here. That's one thing I
got out of, being with the children.”

Some students find it hard or
undesirable to adjust to the academ-
ics at Davidson. Leslie Jacobs neatly
summarized, ‘‘Academics meant little
before I left and means less now.”’
Betty Parks said, “It was the realiza-
tion of how much more there is to
learn besides what is in books.

“‘The importance of grades has
dropped for me,”’ said Sally bondur-
ant. ‘‘Not that I am less concerned
with mastery of the content. I am
simply less success-oriented in the

_academic field than I had been.”’

On the other hand Bob Grizzard
didn’t find it hard to orient himself to
academics. ‘‘I knew more of what I
had to do and I did it.’’ John Umhau
found that academics had become
easier for him he had gotten most of
his premedical course work out of the
way before leaving. Karl Schlotter-
beck took three independent studies
while working in Durham, N.C., and
found less difficulty when he dropped
his job and returned to cantpus.

Vague plans crystallized

Most felt very strongly that leaving
had helped them clear up vague career
objectives. Betty Parks was torn
between a business career and her
desire to work with children. Her
experience in Philadelphia working
with developmentally delayed child-
ren decided her for business.

John Umhau was a pre-med before
he left. ‘‘I wanted to make sure that
my education didn’t. steer me in one
track. A lot of people go into med
school without really thinking ‘Am I
going to be useful as a doctor? Do I
need to boost my ego, or is it going to
help other people?’ You don’t admit

that you do things for status.’’

Umhau is planning to attend Bowman
Grey Medical School next year.

Bob Grizzard said, ‘‘I was thinking
about: pre-med, and decided to take
some time off to make a strong
commitnmient either way—to that or to
an English major.’’ Grizzard now has
plans to teach English in a Charlotte
high school beginning next Septem-
ber.

Leslie Jacobs found play therapy
tremendously exciting in her work in
Philadelphia. She had never heard of
it before leaving to look for a job.

What about social life?

Social readjustment to. Davidson
was easy for most, but difficult for
some. Those who were away for only
one term found it reasonably easy to
come back and feel comfortable.

Jacobs said living off-campus made
it easier to come back because, ‘‘You
aren’t packaged into the dorms that
way.” Umhau said, ‘Fall term is the

missing fall term last year I’ve missed

))

:
knowing a lot of freshmen.” Grizzard
came back after a spring and a
summer away to be a hall counselor.

-“Phat really helped me reorient

myself to campus life.”’

: -. Parks and Schlotterbeck noted that
relationships hadn't changed much.
_ Bondurant noted, ‘‘Even if you go
| through straight in four years the
. number of people. you know and
- associate with diminishes after fresh-

man year. Freshman year is the
critical year when you know all the
upperclassmen and your own class;
thereafter it gets more and more
difficult to meet underclassmen. As
the upperclassmen graduate the num-
ber of active friendships you have
declines.”

77 Do it ” they say

When asked whether they would
make recommendations or give advice
to students considering leaving, four
of the six simply said, “Do it!’’ and
then said no one should attempt to
stay at Davidson for four years
straight.

Jacobs and Bondurant recommen-
ded their trips very highly, but felt it
was not necessary for everyone to
leave, particularly those who ‘‘are
able to maintain a strong sense of
their selfhood already.” ‘‘I think a lot
more people should drop out,’’ Bon-
durant-said,“‘If you-drop out and
return to Davidson, .do not be
egotistically fooled into the idea that
you are the only one who has changed
and grown in the period. Because in
spite of all the restricting forces in
Davidson, the same thing happens to
those who stay behind as the ones
who go. They just do it in a different
way, and they’ve done it here.’’

Friends draw them back

Every person questioned said that
one of the most important reasons he
cathe back was because of friends.
“I’m not sure you can really make a
correlation, a cause and effect, but for
some reason Davidson has the unique
ability to attract exceptional people to
it. I don’t know how, but I value the
opportunity I have here for making
really honest relationships. The dou-
ble edge to that is being able to stay
above all the gossip and murk which
stays around the base of thése honest
relationships. A sense of perspective

can prevent you from getting really

too upset over that—the murk just
isn’t that important,’’ Bondurant
commented.

“The people are what Davidson is
to me now, rather than some name
and the associations that come with
that name,” Jacobs said.

Other reasons were also listed for
coming back: parental guidance,
pragmatism, wanting to finish what
had already been begun, not wanting
to go through the hassles of trans-
ferring to another university.

Perspectives sum it up

What people gained most from the
experience can be summed up in a
single word: perspective. ‘‘I began a
much healthier, but detached, feeling
toward Davidson,’’ Bondurant said.

“I'd definitely get away from this’
place, just so you can get your
bearings on life. I am so high now,”
Umhau commented.

Jacobs summarized, ‘‘I don’t want
to fit in what Davidson is supposed to .
be about. And yet I feel most of the
people here feel that. way, too—they
don't want to fit in either..So what is

vuchimne people get. ta.know.one another, Davidson, this outside thine. or gbat.

people are feeling?’’.
