Gym Hours Remain Same,
Bevan Says Money Available

By HUGH HENNIS
/ Staff Writer

Athletic Director Tom Scott
said this week that the current
gym hours will not be extended
unless the Physical Education
Department receives more
money to hire additional staff
members.

“I would like to see the gym
open longer on Saturdays, but
unless we are given the proper
staff to do this, such an idea is
both impossible and_ un-
feasible,’’ Scott said.

“As to extending weekday
hours, there is no need in such
an activity. The student has
plenty of time to utilize the
facilites during the day, and
keeping the gym open even
later at night would not be wor-
th paying the electric bill.”

The gym is currently open
from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday
through Friday: from 2 p.m. to
5 p.m. Saturdays. and from 7
a.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays.
During important athletic even-
ts. the gym is locked to all ex-
tracurricular activities.

“It's absurd.”” responded
SGA President Ralph Peeples.
“The issue of these gym hours
is just another example of the
bureaucracy in the offices of
Davidson College.

“It seems such a shame that
when the President and staff

challenge."

Bevan and other faculty also
commented on the in-
terpretation of the rule. How is
‘Active’ to be defined, and how
is “church” to be defined?

The Board of Trustees is the
interpretive body, but Vice
President Bevan is responsible
for hiring faculty, and he repor-
ted difficulties with this rule.

McKelway maintains that the
rule “does not by itself guaran-
tee the Christian character of
the college. It tends to create a
fortress mentality.”

Chairman of the Board of
Trustees Warner L. Hall defen-
ded the rule in a telephone in-
terview saving that the college
since its inception has been
Christian oriented and that the
only way to be so is to have a
Christian faculty.

Hall also said that a
college is) to maintain
Christian stance it will do so not
by courses but by people who
teach in the Christian stance.
“Davidson College does not try
to be all things to all men. It is
trying to understand the world
in the light of the Christian
faith.”

In the middle of October, the
exact date has not been con-
firmed yet, the Trustee
Education Committee will meet
with Patterson. who is
president of the Davidson chap-
ter of the American Association
of University Professors. and
other faculty to discuss prin-
ciples of tenure. and the issues
of religious restriction will be
probably be brought before that
group.

another group) which will
discuss this problem as it
studies the Trustee by—laws in
fulfilling its charge to develop a
plan for governing the college.
The wording concerning
religious restriction for tenure
was altered after the Spencer
Commission Report = was

recieved. The old rule required

the Trustees “to satisfy them-
selves as to the Christian faith
of every individual eligible to
receive tenure.”

It was changed to its present
form, requiring active mem-
bership in a Christian church in
order to make it' a less sub-
jective definition, according to
Patterson.

are so interested in opening up
new areas to the student, little
details such as these are neglec-
ted,”’ he said.

“Last year we were bounced
around from the Director of
Athletics to the coaches’ office
to the Comptroller's office. This
year we again are trying to
bring about some productive
results."

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan said that
students could request funds
from the budgets of Buildings
and Grounds, Physical
Education or Student Life.

If money is not available in
these areas, Bevan suggested
that students petition College
President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. for money from the college
contingency fund.

This fund covers areas not
generally anticipated when the
college budget was drawn up.

“The problem concerns one of
two things--either there is a lack
of relating funds, or there is
found to be no need among the
students. If the facilities are to
be used, we ought to meet the
needs of the students,‘* Bevan
said.

Freshman Bill Reed felt that
as the situation stands, the best
and cheapest solution would be
to have responsible volunteers
who could assume the task of
supervising gym activities as
well as closing up at night.

Another freshman said he felt
the gym should be open longer
on Saturday--since this is the
day the student has more
leisure time.
