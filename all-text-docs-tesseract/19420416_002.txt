Tradition ...

Possibly the most hallowed part of the
heritage of every Davidson man is the
sum of ‘the traditions which over the
passage of one hundred and five years
have been acquired, cherished, and
handed down from one student gener-
ation to the next.

The unwritten. customs ‘constitute the
code which makes Davidson, in fact-any
school, different from the rest. They
form the basis. for that intangible known
as atmosphere, the bonds for those cele-
brated ties of fellowship, and theeurrent
tor that kinetic force, spirit.

Perhaps the theme or patriarch tradi-
tron ‘here is that of “The Davidson
Gentleman: At least it has existed
longest. Under it are catalogued many
sma
ing thé exchange of a friendly greeting
with anyone encountered on the campus.

The traditional courtesy to strangers,
which untortunately does not extend to
younger members of the opposite sex,
is a part of this tradition. The custo-
mary behavior at the college dances is
m a real sense included. ° The ‘honor
system and efficient student government
are tangible evidences of the same tradi-
tion. 7

At some time during’ our history,
however, several conflicting traditions
have emerged, For example, a David-
son student can be instantly spotted in
any crowd when a girl passes within
saltuting distance. He is the adolescent

“fiyah.” Kor a sure-fire alma mater

what. follows-Alenda~ Lux,” -arm the
same with two hard snowballs and a
whole window pane and await proof.

But-these-might possibly be excused
by a-broad-minded fair sex and a cop-
ious damage fee. There is another trad-
ition that if not started recently has cer-
tainly become exaggerated during the
current scholastic year, and which prom-
ises to blackball the school’s untarnished
name unless checked. It concerns the
growing of whistling and cutting up
generally during the devotional portion
of the chapel program.

This has finally been accepted by re-
signed and patient student body pres-
idents as the expected accompaniment
for the announcements, but to visiting
service such conduct comes as a rather
‘chilly shock.

One of Davidson’s oldest and best
friends was once heard remarking,
“Davidson students are gentlemen-indi-
vidually, but taken collectively they are
a bunch of hoodlums.” This, it would
appear, is not exactly the reputation we
would like.
