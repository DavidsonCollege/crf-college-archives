PANTOMIME ARTISTS show their flexibility of facial expression.

Goslar’s Pantomime Circus

promises wagon of laughs

“It’s trite to think clowns are sad,”’
heralded pantomime artist Lotte Gos-
lar once said.

She isn’t.

_As director, choreographer, and
costume designer of the Pantomime
Circus set to appear in Love Auditori-
um next Monday night at 8:15, she
doesn’t have time to be.

Her troupe has appeared in com-
munities and colleges across the
country. They have participated in
the major American dance festivals
and have toured across Europe.

The National Endowment for the
Arts gave Miss Goslar four grants to

create new works.

Forced to flee Germany, Goslar has
accumulated a string of critical ac-
claim during her 40 years in America.
She was once a friend and teacher to
Marilyn Monroe.

Her nine member circus will per-
form several scenarios probable con-
taining a conversation with an ant, an
impersonation of a flower or a
mushroom, and a demonstration of
aging.

As part of the Artist Series,
Goslar’s show is available free to any
student willing to walk by the union
desk and pick up a ticket.

Tribute
toa

Earlier this year The Davidsonian
featured an article on an elderly
couple living in the Davidson com-
munity, Mr. and Mrs. George Goudy.

Last Thursday morning George
Goudy died.

Those that knew and loved him will
miss him immensely, since he had
such a deep impact on our lives. For
George Goudy came to Davidson, not
to retire in a peaceful, slow moving
community, but rather to get in-
volved, especially with the students.

His involvement touched many of
our lives, as he helped us struggle
with difficult questions arising from
our courses (many of which he
audited), as he supported DCF every

week with his encouraging presence,
as he was actively involved at DCPC,

and as he invited us to visit him and

his lovely wife in their home.

I remember George Goudy as a

man sincerely committed to an intelli-
gent and uncompromising Christian
faith.

For Mr. Goudy openly claimed that
ther need be no compromise of reason
to be acommitted Christian, and with
this conviction Mr. Goudy lived his
daily life with true faith.

In addition to his sincere, uncom-
promising faith, Mr. Goudy displayed
the mark of a sincere believer by
loving each of us with gentleness and
kindness in his actions towards us.

His faith challenged us to greater
faith, while his love comforted and
encouraged us along the way. And
now that he is gone, our community
will never be quite the same.

And so I write in honor of George
Goudy who has left this world and has
gone to live with the Lord he claimed
to serve,

May we remember his faith and
love, and may we often give thanks
for the deep impression his friendship
has left upon our lives.

The Davidson Christmas
Crafts Fair is going back for
seconds.

In the wake of what they
considered to be avery suc-
cessful first try last December,
student organizers have de-
cided to hold a second bazaar
this Saturday from 10 to 5.

Students and area residents
are expected to pack the tables
in the Union’s Morrison Room
with jewelry, home-made
quilts, needlework, leather
purses and other hand made
goods.

Student Manager Ginny
Newell said that the fair will
be an excellent opportunity for
“the community to get toge-
ther with the college.’’ Coffee
and cake are free for the
asking.

Newell demanded that those
who want to sell items get in
touch with her immediately so
that there will be enough
tables ready. She said that
there was no entrance fee for
potential customers.

Newell said she thought this
would be a good opportunity
for people to get part of their
Christmas shopping out of the
