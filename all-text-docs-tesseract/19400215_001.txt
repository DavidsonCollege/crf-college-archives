Omicron Delta Kappa, at its last
meeting _ February
6, received a report from its Com-
mittee on Campus Politics, com-
posed of Karl Hudson, Jack Hol-
land, and Sam Spencer, and, after
going on record in favor of ‘the
report, passed it on to the Student
Council as a recommendation.

The principle suggestion put
forth in this report to the Council
are as follows:

(1) That a fundamental system
of closed politics be followed and
that there be -strong.opposition a-
gainst any form of open politics.

(2) That the present system of
politics and order of running off
elections should be followed pro-
vided that elections are speeded up
and are not allowed to drag out
over an indefinite period of time.
It was also suggested that alk elec-
tions not beheld on one day:

The committee decided against
speeches stating the qualifications
of candidates.

(3) That the present system of
voting in chapel be abolished in
favor of voting by ballot.
Two ballot boxes would be placed
in Chambers under the constant
supervision of Council members,
and a registration list would be
kept in order to check off each
student as he votes.

(4) That a plan be favored which
would place the curbing of pos-
sible fraternity combines in, the
hands of the Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil, because:

(a) Each Pan-Hellenic Council-
man is an officer of his fraternity
and has more influence in the
group; (b) some fraternities are
not even represented on the Stu-
dent Council; (c) it would enhance
the importance of the Pan-Hellenic
Council in making it more than a
campus organization to sponsor
dances.

The above reforms were accepted
in full by the Council in addition
to some supplementary material
that was added by the Council it-
self, and it will serve to govern
future elections.
