(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

A Realistic Approach

We welcome the faculty change in
acadegpic regulations.

Abolition of the academic probation
system, easing the restriction of max-
imum class hours per semester—we
are extremely pleased to note these
new changes as assumptions of stu-
dent maturity. Likewise, we regard
them as challenges to individual stu-
dent maturity. Ultimately they place
more responsibility for intellectual
achievement on the invidual student.

Overhaul of the academic probation
system has been overdue for some-
time. Required attendance at all class-
es and labs supposedly has sought to
provide “aid by exposure,” but the
system in practice seems to have been
more punitive than helpful.

Certain nebulous phrases in the reg-
ulations of academic probation were
also confusing. For instance, the stu-
dent on AP was allowed to leave the
campus and thus represent it in an
unofficial capacity but was not al-
lowed to represent it in any official
capacity.

The regulation concerning the max-
imum number of semester hours a
student was permitted to take was
also in need of change. The original
ruling that a student have a “B” aver-
age for the preceding semester to
take more than 15 hours had already
been modified in enough ways so as
to make a new ruling imperative. This
old regulation also penalized a stu-

Vespers Revisited

A year has passed since the faculty
granted students the option of attend-
ing the morning service of any David-
son church in lieu of the regular ves-
pers service at the College Church.

The news was happily received last
spring by the Student Body .. . and
justly so. The faculty granted the stu-
dent the liberty to select which church
in Davidson he would attend.

The step, we believe, was essential-
ly an attempt to allow students more
freedom. But in allowing more free-
dom the faculty also paved the way
for more meaningful worship: A lim-
ited amount of choice takes some of
the bitterness out of a system of com-
pulsion. And the elimination of bitter-
ness makes possible a more receptive
attitude toward religions.

No longer is the student compelled
to attend vespers which is little more
than a mockery of religion. Granted,
vespers is one of the most entertain-
ing hours of the week, but only the
cynic would dare label the episode
“spiritually moving.” Even .outstand-
ing preachers can do but little before
an antagonistic “congregation.”

In vespers one does not realize the
“community worship” ideal which is
sought. Rather one finds a maze of up-
side-down collection plates . . . the lat-
est novels . .. snores . . . the buzz of
conversation . . . upside-down hym-
nals. ...

dent whose grades had slipped below
the required average for even one
semester, with no consideration for
his overall college record.

But what these changes in faculty
regulations constitute is an assump-
tion: If the average student is given a
greater share of the responsibility for
fulfilling the College academic re-
quirements, he will show his maturity
by living up to this responsibility.

There is a paradox in this College-
student relationship. The College re-
ceives a young man deficient both in
his intellectual and emotional capac-
ities and in four years is expected to
turn out a mature person. But this
transformation cannot be accomplish-
ed unless the student is given a chance
himself to handle part of the responsi-
bilities for his education. At the same
time he is generally not mature
enough to handle the entire load him-
self. Hence, there is always a thin line
which must be continually redrawn
between College discipline and respon-
sibility and student freedom and re-
sponsibility.

We commend the six members of
the faculty committee for their work
and. salute the faculty for taking this
Step.

We also hope that students as in-
dividuals will take note of these new
responsibilities and meet them in a
mature manner. MLH

The optional worship system which
has been in effect for the past year
permits the student to escape the ves-
pers’ farce by substituting a more
meaningful service.

v * *

We believe the college should not
only retain but also should broaden
the scope of the present vespers rule.
Attendance should not be limited to
Davidson churches; rather it should be
expanded to all churches. Such an
expansion of the rule would enable
the student to attend his hometown
church on Sunday morning rather
than vespers at Davidson.

Further. changing the requirement
would enable the student whose faith
is not represented by a church in Da-
vidson to attend a service of his faith
in lieu of vespers at the College
Church.

Such a change would be in keeping
with the policy—carried out by the
Admissions Office — of disregard for
religion in accepting a student for Da-
vidson. Such a change would be in ac-
cord with the concept of toleration ex-
pounded throughout the course of a
liberal education. And finally such a
change would aid Davidson in its goal
of developing spiritually mature men:
for religious opportunities would be
greatly expanded while the compul-
sion so harmful to religion would be
minimized. OLD

‘WrongNumber, Ring Again

Strange, how the idea of room
phones struck some people — one
might have thought that we had recom-
mended sign-ins and sign-outs night-
ly for the student body, rather than
mere room phones. At any rate, since
both proponents and enemies of the
proposal have attacked us, we feel we
are headed in the right direction.

The response of the student body
with respect to room phones being
somewhat less than overwhelming, ob-
viously we have erred in our presenta-
tion of either the idea or its practice.
Feeling inexorably determined to car-
ry through this idea of room phones,
we, of course, see the fault lying with
the explanation that appeared on page
two of last week’s issue, although we

do admit a strong vase can be made
for additional pay phones or a switch-
board.

_ A few misconceptions over the sub-
ject: (1) Room phone service would
still be strictly optional. No student
would be forced to wallow in such lux-
ury. (2) Room phones would facilitate
inter-dorm communication—currently
impossible by phone after 11 a.m.
Wasted time could be cut in half or
used in more original ways. (3) Costs
for room phones would still not be
prohibitive. If two students share a
room, it is assumed the cost would be
split. Two or three rooms could share
a phone—total cost per month could
be less than a dollar per student, less
than the price of one coin call per
day. MLH

New Militancy Invades
Civil Rights Movement

By CALVIN ZON

The following is an attempt to deal with some of the basic questions which have
arisen regarding the civil rights movement, and which the recent trend of events,
is bringing increasingly into focus.

namely, the new militancy,

CivIL VS. CRIMINAL DIS-
OBEDIENCE: The abortive
World's Fair stall-in was, I be-
lieve, both morally and tactic-
ally wrong. It posed a needless
threat to public safety. This kind
of action only serves to alienate
the ‘white liberal’ on whom the
success of the civil rights move-
ment depends.

Criminal disobedience, which
is not aimed at ending a spe-
eific discriminatory practice,
and often involves unruly ele-
ments, is a far cry from civil
disobedience.

Responsible people in the civ-
il rights movement must stand
firm against this type of action
even at the risk of being labeled
“white liberal’? and “Uncle
Tom’. just as moderate leaders
like Martin Luther King have
been branded as ‘radical’ and
“extremist.”

On the other hand, the whole
civil rights movement should
not be judged by the actions of
a few hotheads.

LEGISLATION: Compromise
is the essence of the American
system of government and civil
rights legislation offers no ex-
ception to the rule. One should
not confuse a political compro-
mise’ with a compromise of
principle.

However, Congressional fail-

ure to enact meaningful rights”

legislation in the face of a

Southern filibuster would spell
disaster for social justice and
social peace. The angry young
men who are appearing here
and there in the rights move-
ment.might no longer be in the
minority.

“FREEDOM NOW”: This by-
word of the Second American
Revolution is a good slogan but
makes for a dangerous harden-
ing attitude if taken too serious-
ly. Ideally, ‘freedom’ should
have existed in America from
the beginning and we should
have no need for such slogans.

Three hundred years may be
“but a tick in the clock of eter-
nity’’ as Kilpatrick phrased it,
but for a nation it is a long
time and for an individual it is
meaningless.

Yet it will be a matter of dec-
ades before full equality of op-
portunity is attained. In the
meantime, the, Negro must pre-
pare himself. especially in edu-
cation, for the new worlds open-
ing to him.

DE FACTO SCHOOL SEG-
REGATION: Demands for an
end to school segregation resuit-
ing from discriminatory housing
patterns have been behind re-
cent school boycotts and even
violence in Northern cities. Al-
though these demands are un-
derstandable, I believe that too
much emphasis is being placed
on schemes to achieve “racial

balance’ by which school chil-
dren are often ‘bussed’ long
distances, being assigned on the
basis of race.

More attention should be giv-
en to raising the quality of edu-
cation under the existing sys-
tem, and effecting integrated
housing, the root of the school
problem.

“OUTSIDE AGITATORS”:
This derogatory label has often
been placed on Northerners who
involve themselves in ‘“South-
ern” racial problems. Yet one
should remember that we are
all American citizens and. in a
sense, citizens of the world.
This term could rightly be ap-
plied, however, to those who at-
tempt to capture local leader-
ship from responsible rights
leaders, or who adopt hit-and-
Tun, free-for-all tactics.

COMMUNIST IN FIL TRA-
TION: J. Edgar Hoover has
stated that Communists have
entered the ranks of the rights
movement, but that no leader-
ship positions are held by Com-
munists. This is not surprising
since Communists can be ex-
pected to try to exploit situa-
tions of unrest.

What is remarkable is that
Negroes have almost wnani-
mously shirked the appeals of
Communist and other extremist
groups despite a history of white
suppression.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

‘Davidsonian’ And Sex:
A Separation Urged

Editor’s note: Joon Yoo is a
1963-1964 Richardson Scholar
from Seoul, South Korea.

Dear Editor:

In last week’s THE DAVID-
SONIAN the “playmate” was
given an unusually large spread.
Though not’ an acccomplished
journalist. I have been on the
Board of Editors of a Korean
student newspaper and have at
least been introduced to some of
the principles of good journal-
ism,

To please the tastes of the
student body is undoubtedly
important, but | submit that
to be a mirror of campus Ife
and. a stimulant to student
thought is by far the most im-
portant task for a newspapér.
As far as student life is con-
cerned the appearance of on2
of the “famed” playmates is
a trivial event.

If a noted authority had enme
to campus or the paper was be
reft of material to print. I cowld
understand the lavish spread for
the “‘playmate™’, but as the pa
per should be a voicebox of the
intelligence of the Davidson stu-
dent and a channel of communi-
cation between the school and
alumni, parents, etc.—I can see
no reason for such publicity.

Though I am admittedly a neo-
phite to the Davidson way of life
and come from a more conserv-
ative milieu, I feel that journal-

istic standards of excellence are
more similar than not through-
out. the world.

Dear Editor:

‘*., . . I choose to ignore those
people (who are not) broad-
minded,"’ said Naney Jo Hooper.
And most of us don’t choose to
listen to those who aren't
‘broad-minded’’ either. Per-
haps. though, it is not a matter
of being broad-minded, but a
matter of choosing what we're
to be narrow-minded about, even
‘f that is narrow-mindedness.

There is no one without prej-
udice, so, prejudiced, I write.
And I'm a hypocrite too, but if
no one who were a hypocrite
protested. all would be sileat.
Of course, that fact is no ex-
cuse for hypocrisy. but neither
is it an excuse for silence.

The Playmate came and kiss-
ed and now has left us “nice
college boys.’' And by now the
covers have been worn off of
most of this month's Playboys
distributed to the fraternities
“Courtesy of Rush Wilson Ltd.”
Surely Rush is a good guy and
therefore we should buy lots and
lots of Gold Cup socks.

Moreover, since Burlington
Mills was gracious enough to
bring Miss Hooper to Charlotte,
we should naturally infer that
they must be worthy of our pat-

Group Notes Nothings

The Omega Chapter of Who's
Nothing inducted 30 proven
nothings into Its ranks at chap-
et this morning.

The tapping followed an ad-
dress on “Nothingness” by Er-
nie Patterson, who, In addi-
tion to a BS and PhD, holds
an honorary Litt. D. from The
Charlotte Observer.

Conducting the tapping were
perennial nothings Johnny Ari:
all, Dick Merchant, John Bour-
deaux, “Tank’’ MacDiarmid
“Barret” Adams, “Basement”
Fuller, “Rat Lowery, and
“Pinhead” Payne.

Tapped were “Jaw” Bla-
lock, “F.H.H.” Harrison, ‘’Di-
no” Nemir, “Tram-Tram”
Trammell, “Dumbo” Rhyne,
“Jocko” Willilams, “’Gnome”’
Covington, and “Perpetual
Freshman” Holland.

Also included were Hill Well-
ford, R. R. Nickel, “Machi’’
Barron, “Skinny’’ Compton,
‘John Sink, “Wishy-Washy’”
Jones, “Slick Ben’ Moore,
and “Moose” Hendrix.

Too much of nothings to at-
tend the ritual were B. J. Mor-
gan, “‘Mad-dog” Hughes, and
“Dibble” Dibble.

Overlooked in the nothings’

solemn haste but sought later,
alas, too late, was Bob Greg-

Dear Editor:

Looking at the stage of Cham-
bers after the so-called ‘‘Who's
Nothing’ farce today, I some-
how got the impression that the
“zeroes’* on stage are the real
campus leaders. Many of the
group have over a 2.0 average
(really not very bad!). There
are three fraternity presidents
and four captains of varsity ath-
letic teams among them.

Now I! would like to know how
these ‘‘zips’’ were so honored
and I was not. I rank 195th in
my class of 224; I have never
handed in a paper on time: and
my only campus activity was
my brief tenure on the basket-
ball team before the glory days.

My top endeavor of four
years here was to apply to take
the Graduate Record Exam
April 25. But due to a social
confliet I slept through it.

Understand, of course,.I'm not
bitter, I realize I've tried too
hard.

J. Ken Briggs °64

(Editor's note: True to form,
the author turned in his letter
three days late. However, con-
sidering his remarkable record,
we walved our deadline in this
case.)

Trontage too! Davidson seems
none the worse for the encoun-
ter.

However, this form of adver-
tising used by Mr. Wilson and
Burlington Mills is symptomat-
ic, indicating some fundamental
value judgments on the part of
the advertiser as well as the
consumer.

It seems to me that, if for no
other reason than to do some-
thing about getting along with
people in these chaotic times,
human relationships must be
based on something other than
exploitation.

STRAUMANN

(Editor’s note: Ben Strau-
mann is a 1963-1964 Richardson
Scholar from Erlinsvach, Swit-
zerland.)

Dear Editor:

I'feet rather personally attack-
ed by former Richardson Schol-
ar Gerritsen’s remarks in his
letter of May 1 about this year's
foreign students in connection
with the Charlotte civil rights
march...

Gerritsen questions my “right
to show open condemnation of a
society into which I have only
recently been hospitably ac-
cepted.”” I question his right to
attribute. false and stupid mo-
tives to my participation in a
demonstration about which he
admittedly does not have any
information except through the
college newspaper.

Also I have some doubts as
to whether Gerritsen is in any
better position to give me ad-
vice and to pass judgment after
his “few months in North Caro-
lina’ than I am to make deci-
sions as I see fit.

Furthermore, Gerritsen’s im-
plication that the expression
of my opinion in favor of a
bill which has passed the
House of Representatives and
Is filibustered by a minority
of senior senators is an “open
condemnation” of American
society is absolutely ridicu-
lous.

It is certainly a very valid
proposal ‘‘to read about the sub-
ject and talk our views over
with American students and
friends’ ...

Perhaps he (Gerritsen)
would understand then that
the racial situation is changing
fast, that the peaceful march
on Washington has been fol-
lowed by bloodshed in Jack-
sonville, and that in view of
this situation some people get
sick of talking” ...

As to Gerritsen’s conclusion, it
seems to me that whether a
quiet, peaceful demonstration in
favor of the Civil Rights Bill is
‘improper conduct™ to ‘make
heroes out of us,’ ... “an in-
sult to Americans and beneficial
to nobody,”’ is not up to his opin-
jonated arrogance to decide.

AN URCHIN’S WAY |
Social Revenge:

‘Life’ Or

‘No Life”?

By DUNCAN D, NEWCOMER

“The bell tolls even on each man’s individual is-
land .. .”, That is life. With it we can do one of two
things—get involved in the blood and sweat or forget

the whole thing called life.

Yet a voice says blood and sweat mean tears. Surely
there is a life worth living without blood, sweat, and
tears. So we build fences. But. good fences mean no
neighbors, and we are left alone—tall and lonely, pine

trees that cast no shadow.

The voice says give one damn reason why it is
wrong to cast no shadow! Why not be socially irrele-

vant?

I will not say because the world needs bright, young

Davidson graduates

to lead on to sunlit uplands. We

don’t believe in sunlit uplands. I will not say that social
relevance pays off. It is largely foolish to think that if
I help you across the street you will later help me.

Even if we did help each other, Why? Nor will 1
say that social relevance makes one warm and mushy
inside. Real social involvement can kill. When the warm
glow turns hot and the mush turns to muck then we
turn in our Salvation Army tambourines.

Social relevance then is not found in the bread
basket of altruism, nor does man live on that unleavened

bread alone.

So, forget altruism. Forget social relevance. Culti-
vate the “It.” Gaze upon the navel. When Time maga-

zine asks you to say somethin

about your generation,

roll over and grunt, “My book, my bed, my girl, my

bottle.”

But then something happens. A president gets shot
or a New York City girl gets stabbed before the sleepy-
eyed view of 38 witnesses—horrified consciences cry
out—two weeks later another New York girl gets raped
before 40 people. Something happens and darkly we see
that a cultivated “I” leads to a cultivated “It.”

No altruism. No introspective gaze. No life? Only
say “No life” if your fate is worse than Oedipus, or Jesus
of Nazareth, or Kennedy. Only say “No life” if never
once has the mystery of “I am” struck you. Only say
“No life” if the word love means nothing to your world.
Only say “No life’ if the words beauty, joy, suffering,

and justice are to you just

hollow echoes.

But if you affirm life at all, then you affirm blood,
sweat, tears. If life has grasped you at all, then by the
grace of life you will grasp it. You will not be able to

keep from involvement.

Even as life has first loved you—in response—you

will love life. Because Life

has come:you will become

socially relevant, come life or death. For it is all in the

package of Life.

Former Student Body Exec
Supports NSA Retention

By JOHN SPRATT

The atmosphere for Monday's referendum on NSA
is not quite so charged as that of last fall. Now, with even
the DAVIDSONIAN edging into our ranks, it appears that
NSA will be favorably endorsed without so much as a

single pink poster waged in

Nonetheless, I wouldn't want
to inflate my optimism with too
much unfounded hope. It might
well be timely to present a sy-
nopsis of some of the benefits
of NSA affiliation which have
accrued over the past year. It
would at least offer some evi-
dence that
completely talking through our
hats to keep some pet project
on campus.

On several occasions over the
past school year, the student
government has been able to
make use of the Student Gov-
ernment Information Service.
Information has been obtained
on honot systems across the
country, student regulations,
freshman regulations, etc.

S 0 me information coming
through NSA has been made
specifically available to certain
campus organizations, such as
the civil rights group. Much of
the other information — pam-
phlets, circulats, bulletins, an-
nouncements — has been made
accessible to the student body
in the lobby of the college un-
ion.

In a similar vein, a campus
travel committee under the di-
rection of John Carson has been
able to make available to the
student body the resources of

objection.

Educationa) Travel, Inc., a sub-
sidiary of NSA.

The student council has also
acted on several NSA recom-
mendations, such as the recent
letter concerning the Tougaloo
College charter suspension pro-
posal. On the regional level, we
have participated in a compre-
hensive survey poll of the role
and relevancy of student gov-
ernments on campuses in the
Carolinas and Virginias.

Also, the regional has re-
solved to take action to make
NSA a more politically accept-
able group in the South, by
making ft less political. An-
other benefit coming indirect-
ly from NSA is MODERA-
TOR magazine.

By far, however. the major
contribution of NSA has undoubt
-edly been the appearance of the
Israeli singers and dancers here
on our campus under NSA’s
sponsorship. The cost to the
student council was only thirty-
five dollars, For those who saw
the program, I need not men-
tion any more.

NSA admittedly (and we've
admitted it all along) hasn't
changed the face of Davidson.
But it is hardly a deadwood or-
ganization. And it's worth your
vote of approval on Monday.
