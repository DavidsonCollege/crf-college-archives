main reason for this is the work done
by Prof. Wachter in forming these ac-,

INITIATED FOUR MEN TO
SIGMA UPSILON

On Wednesday night the Blue Pencil
chapter of Sigma Upsilon, national liter-
ary fraternity, initiated its four recent
electates from the rising Senior class.
The initiates were: S. W. Brown, C. F.
Monk, E. P. O’Connor and R. B. Parker. |
Each of these men has shown unusual |
brilliance in literary achievement thus
winning election to Sigma: Upsilon, the
highest honor bestowed for literary
prowess.

_S. F. Brown has gained recognition as
one of the premier short story writers
in college and has also been a frequent
contributor of poetry and essays to the)
Magazine. Brown has only recently |
be en appointed Short Story Editor of |
the Magazine. He is also a leading mem- |
ber of the I. R. Club.

His recent election as Editor of the
Magazine sufficiently bespeaks Monk's
ability as a writer. Monk is one of the
prominent members of his class. He has |
been a member of the Davidsonian staff, |
assistant cheer leader and member of
Board of Control.

E. P. O'Connor is undoubtedly one of
the most gifted writers at Davidson. He
is perhaps the poct-laureate of the col-
lege. As Poetry Editor of Magazine,for
the past year, he has acquitted himself
creditably. O'Connor, too, is a member
of The Davidsonian staff, and of the|
I. R. Club.

Roland Parker has won recognition
in literary circles in various departments.
He is Essayist Editor of the Magazine
and Associate Editor of The Davidson-
ian. He has also won prominence in
other lines, being President of the ris-
ing Senior class, a recent electate of
Omicron Delta Kappa, an Honor’ Roll
man, member of Alpha Phi Epsilon, the
“y”" Cabinet and the I. R. Club.

C. F. Smith is the only other Junior
who can claim membership in Sigma
Smith, who was elected last
fall, is the most versatile writer in
Davidson, and is one of the leaders in
the student body. He is Editor-in-Chief
of The Davidsonian, and a»member of
Omicron Delta Kappa. Since his fresh-
man year, Smith has been recognized as
the literary genius of his class.

Davidson seems to have promising
material in the line of tennis. With most

Carolina team composed of Mogulescu, '

of the-varsity graduating next year some

one is going to be needed.

Comparative results of meets by both
schools with Wofford, and time in the
cvents, foretells a heated contest—not
only in running, but in the field events,
too.
