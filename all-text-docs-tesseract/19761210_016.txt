Students’ heroes defy consistency

By MARIELLEN SAWADA
Staff Writer

The traditional hero image of days
gone by has taken new shape at
Davidson College. No longer are there
a few control figures seen and
acknowledged as heroes. Instead,
there are many personalities that
obtain admiration rather than wor-
ship.

Ina recent survey, students were
asked if they had heroes. The major-

ity of the seventy students question-’

ed, did not.

Of those questioned, thirty-three
had at least one hero, thirty-six had
no heroes, and only one person did not
know.

‘‘A hero is someone admired and
respected and put on a higher level. I
know people who would fit in the first
category but not in the second,’’
reasoned one freshman for not having
a hero,

Another student explained that she
didn’t have a hero because, ‘‘...I am
myself and I don’t want to imitate
someone else. A hero is someone that
you'd like to see yourself become.”’

There seemed to be the consensus
of those interviewed that there are not
as many heroes as there used to be.

One junior reasoned, ‘‘Maybe we've
become so sophisticated and idealistic
that no one wants to be a hero—you

must be under a lot of pressure to be a
hero.”’

Others suggested that perhaps
people are no longer looking for heroes
or even thinking about them.

The question, then, is, are there
heroes to be had in this world?

“‘In as much as a person allows
himself to make goals for himself,
heroes are to be had,’’ answered a
senior. He, however, would not tell
who his hero was.

Of all the heroes named, only one
name was mentioned twice. Abraham
Lincoln was named by a Texan and a
Georgian.

Said a Texan freshman, ‘‘I liked his
values, his action in a crisis, and his
way of standing up for his decisions...
he tried to do what was best for the
country even though (he was) cut
down. He was gentle but strong and
so wise. He’s been my hero since the
fourth grade.”’

The Georgian stated that he ad-
mired Lincoln’s humanity. ‘‘He was
gentle and kind. He didn’t try to
bully people. He was very wise.”’

The heroes that were named by
others polled covered a full scope of
subjects. Thirteen of the heroes feel
into the actor/entertainer category.
Those admired for acting talents were
James Bond, Charles Bronson, John
Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, and Char-

tarian Bob Hope. Only one woman,
Cicely Tyson, was mentioned. Those

Characters from books were Prince

he tried to realize his dreams,”’ and
Holden Caufield.

Sports stars named as heroes were
Bert Jones and Bart Starr.

Other answers were:

my father and my Lutheran mini-
ster.’’ Only one person said that Jesus
was his hero. ‘‘...because he was so
able to love and to forgive.”

William Buckley's ‘‘sharp wit and
conservatism”’ won him an admirer—
the same admirer of the ‘‘bald and
innovative’’ Milton Friedman.

‘Martin Luther King is my hero. I
liked his idea of nonviolent protest.”

Other heroes were Churchill, Ben
Franklin, and ‘‘my mother’’. :

For some, a hero is someone whose
characteristics are admirable and thus
are those th&t are coveted. A hero
isn’t ‘‘the perfect person’’ but is a
person who succeeds even in the face
of mistakes. Said a sophomore, ‘‘A
hero fills an inadequacy that you find
within yourself.”’

For other, a hero is someone that
one patterns his life after. However,
this is the hero worship that most
students back away from.

“T like the way I am: but I also have
heroes. I think that it’s healthy to
strive for better characteristics and
that’s easier to do when they’re in
someone you admire...After all, any-
thing worth having is worth better-
ing.

Of all the heroes named, most were
heroes because, as one student put it
when speaking of his, ‘‘...their ability
to stand up for what they believe and
to put into actions their beliefs.’’
