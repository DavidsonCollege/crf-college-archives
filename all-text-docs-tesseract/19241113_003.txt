But this picture of apparent hate was con-
trasted to the real thoughts of the soldier as
he pictured in his mind how this land where
war was raging could be turned into a land
where peace reigned and war was forgotten.
The speaker then described the soldiers as
making a solemn promise that they would

come true.

Mr. Lockhart said it was not true when

what ideals of government the founders of
Davidson had. He spoke of the courage of
Dr. Morrison and his associates in the early
days of Davidson, and the rich heritage
which they have left the students of today.
“American needs as never before, leader-
ship ’midst such surroundings—leadership of
patriotism, of visions, and of courage,” so
said the speaker. He called on Davidson
men to take the ideals of Wilson and Dr.
Morxison. aed ether men who have had great
ideals of government and life in general and
‘to strive to carry out these ideals) and make
life better with them. With these words, Mr.

Dr. C. M. Richards, pastor of the Preshby-
terian Church at Davidson, made a short but
interesting talk on “Davidson.” He put spe-
cial the Davidson — fighting
spirit. He called the audience's attention to |
the part the founders of Davidson took in
the Revolutionary War, and the action of the
Davidson student body in the Civil War.
Dr. Richards then very briefly told of Da-

To Prof. C.K. Brown was given the task
of telling the part Davidson men played in
the World War. He read the names of 19
men who gave the supreme sacrifice. — But
instead of speaking so much of the war ree-
ord of Davidson, Mr. Brown said that he
would rather consider the part Davidson took
and is taking in peace, He preferred that
“the Muse talk to Minerva, rather than
