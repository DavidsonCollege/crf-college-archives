CLASS BASE BALL.

The inter-class base ball season prom-
ises to be one of unusual. interest. Each
class has succeeded in putting out a
good, well rounded team, and the race
for the championship is exceedingly
close.

The first game was played last Tues-
day between the Sophs and the Fresh,
the Sophs winning 6 to o. The batteries
were J. Fowle and S. Fowle for the
Sophs, and Nimocks and Burns for the
first year men. The feature of this
game was the pitching of Fowle, who
succeeded in striking out eighteen of his
opponents.

The second game was between the
Juniors and the Seniors and was won by
the former 7 to 3. T. White and B.
White for the Juniors, and Cashion and
McIntire composed the batteries.

The Junior-Fresh game was a run-
away for the Fresh. They piled up 24
hits and 28 runs, while the Tuniors made
12 hits and 10 runs. Smith and Bonev
pitched for the Juniors, while Nimocks
was on the mound for the Freshmen.

The next game, between the Sophs
and the Seniors, was the best game of the
series, and was not won bv the Seniors
until the ninth, when McIntire brought
in the winning run with a timely sinele.
The final score was 5 to 4. The bat-
teries were Daffin and Kine for the
Sophs. and Cashion and McIntire for
the Seniors.

In an. exciting twelve-inning game
Mondav afternoon, the Juniors won
from the Sophs 7 to 6. Bullock won the
game with a two-bagger after two men
were out. Fowle pitched a good game
for the Sophs., White and White for the
Seniors, and Fowle and King for the
Sonvhs, were the batteries.

aided by two misplays of the Davidson
team, Spencer won Saturday from Dav-
idson by a score of 3 to 2. The game
was fast and interesting thruout. Law-

the most part well scattered. Davidson

choice and a double by Alford, and one
again in the fifth when E. Poole allowed
Lawson’s single to get thru him for
a home run. Spencer did not score un-

over the left field fence for a home run.
Then came the unlucky ninth. Poole.
