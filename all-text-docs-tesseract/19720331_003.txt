How can the Davidson student

with the problems of de-
humanization and personal ad-
justmient in an intensely com-
petitive academic atmosphere?

‘Glinical © psychologists, hal!
counselors and faculty all play
an important part in counseling
BPavidson students, according to
Psychologist Meredith Hall and
Dean of Students Will Terry.

‘How. a college deals with
maladjusted or unhappy stu-
dents depends upon its values.
If, Davidson students are to have
more than the ability to re-
spond. intellectually, then some-
cne must be there to meet their
emotional needs,” said Hall.
-“Many students just don’t
know. who they are or what's
going on inside them. They are
looking for a feeling of self,
and they need someone whose
main concern is dealing with
those feelings,” Hall stated.

Hall remarked that an all-
male. school often lacks emo-
tional outlets for students. * With.
out girls, the display of emotion
is less accepted. I think coedu-
cation would give the male stu:
dent permission to experience
more feeling,” he said.

Lack of diversity in the stu-
dent body tends to make David-
son “culturally isolated,” ac-
cording to Hall. ‘Because most
students are from the same
background, there is little inter-
play of the forces present in
séciety.

**Students tend to think they
know what to expect frorh their
friends. This fosters an ar ificial
atmosphere 2nd reduces person.
al exchanges,” Hall added.

Hall denied that this climatc
necessarily ‘leads to an increased
us® “of diugs. He remarked.
*‘Many people who come to me
experiment with drugs, but drug
ubuse is:the greatest problem
of only: a minority.”

Hall emphasized the role of
the psychologist as a listener.
‘“My counseling ability comes
not from formal education, but
from my willingness to concen-
trate on the student’s emotional
needs,” he said.

The college psychologist pro-
gram will be strengthened next
year. According to Vice Presi-
deni for Academic Affairs John
Bevan, the college will employ
Hall and Psychology Professor
W. B. Workman on a half-time
basis, giving the equivalent of
a full-time psychologist om cam-
pus.

With the expanded program,
psychologists will be able to see
only the more seriously disturb-
ed students, Hall said. “I saw
about 90 students last year and
probably reached just part of
those with significant psycho-
logical concerns.”

Hall denied that better train-
ed hall counselors could counsel
studcuts nédw seeing him. ‘Hall
counselors can cave for many
s udents, but I doubt they would
feel comfortable with someone
experiencing serious problems,”
he added.

Great myths and misconcep-
tions have arisen ‘1 the last
few years concerning psycholog-
ical encoun.er groups. They
are viewed by some with con-
tempt as being a pait of the
new liberalism and by others
as being an experience that will
solve all their problems.

During the past four years,
some Davidscu students have
been able to make their own
decision on the mat er by par-
ticipating in encounter groups

have limited effectiveness with
personal problems, according to
Hall. ‘‘It’s a misconception that
faculty must be interested in
people. Professors focus not on
students’ personal lives, but on
their academic work.

‘‘We shouldn’t ask a professor
to be a helping person unless he
is excited about it,” Hall added.
“Then we should pay. the ad-
viser to make that role mean-
ingful.”

Terry also emphasized the
need for people trained to list-
en. ‘We want to concentrate on
teaching hall counselors and
faculty advisers to relax with
students and feel competent to
listen,” Terry stated. .

Terry said the ~relationship
between the hall counselor and
faculty adviser needed to be
strengthened. ‘‘Faculty advisers
should be able to work with hall
counselors. Then we need some
feedback on how effective facul-
ty advisers are,” remarked Ter-
ry. .

Terry included academic coun-
seling in the college’s over-all
program. “‘The main problem

Various Counseling Services

Work Toward Common Ends

‘By THOM NICOLL

- “Asst. Managing Editor

A survey of several area col-
leges indicates that counseling
services vary widely, though
stated purposes are nearly iden-
tical:

U.N.C. at Charlotte provides
a Counseling center for its stu-
dents staffed by three profes-
siéhal counselors, a psychome-
trist and a secretary. Though
each counselor teaches one
course per semester, his pri-
mary role is that of a counselor,
according to Dr. R. B. Simino,
director of the counseling cen-
ter.

“Small, selective —_ schools
seetii' to’ conceive of every fac-
ulty member to be a r'rofes-
sional counselor. Put faculty
interests and concerns don't
always:run in that direction,
and they can't meet students’
needs adequately,’ he said.

Simino did admit that tthe fac-
ulty can be useful in counseling,

=" if they are given some

seems, to fit .Simino’s analysis.
According to Dean of S.udents

Diane Del Pizzo, no conrseling
is provided at Queens in a for-
mal sense.

‘‘We do have two interns from
UNCC, but we primarily de-
pend on our faculty, particular-
ly the psychology and ieligion
departments, to informally help
students who ‘:ave needs.” she
said.

Del Pizzo said that her office
acted as a referral service for
counseling available outside of
the college, but that more help
should be provided within the
college itself.

Wake Forest University has
available for students a coun-
seling center staffed by the equi-
valent of two and a half full time
counselors.

David Hills, the only full-time
counselor in the cenier, said
that, ideally, the center should
provide general, preventative
assistance to the entire student
body, but that lack of time re-
quired that the counseling cen-
ter concentrate on the serious
and specific problems of uw re-

latively small number of stu-
dents.
Hills said, ‘‘We are now try-

ing to train the graduate stu-
dents who serve as _ residence
hall counselors in some coun-
seling techniques.

Hills referred to a study that
the counselors had made in 1e-
gard to where most siudents
turn for help. The general put-
tern was to first seek help from
fellow students,
ulty members or parents, then
at last resort to come to the
center.

Winthrop College is planning
a counseling center which will
place primary emphasis on the
health of the community as a
whole rather than on lengthy
individual analysis and counsel-
ing.

According to the Winthrop
student newspaper, the college
will hire one -Ph.D. to direct
the program, who will be sher-

ed with the psychology depart- .

ment, and a full-time, 12-month
counselor.
The center plans to work in

conjunction with a group .of pa-.
raprofessionals, many. of them.

have had 35 hours of intensive. ;

training in counseling.

er group. Personally, he tries
not to pin down a ‘‘name of the
game” in the groups he facili-
tates.

Hall uses the word ‘‘facilitates”
rather than ‘‘conducts” because
he likes to emphasize that he is
as much a part of the group as
anyone else.

“In my groups, we may get
angry, but that’s not the pur-
pose of the group. I try to have
a group where the potential for
people to be what they are with-
out facades is there, so they
dont have to pretend to be
what they aren't.”

There ‘have been five of the
groups. so far this year and sev-
eral girls from Queens, Johnson
C. Smith, and Davidson have
participated. Each group is com-
prised of eight to 10 peopie.
They are conducted at Hall’s
home near Salisbury and run
from Saturday until Sunday af-
ternoon. °

Hall's groups are run with a
wide-open, almost non-existent
format. Rather than set subjects
of discussion, everyone simply
sits down in a room until some-
one says something. As Hall de-
scribes it, ‘“At first you just sit
there looking at each other, but
then people try to do things
and you just bump into each
other for a while.

“Everyone wants to be open
and relaxed because they feel
that’s a good thing to do. It
comes about sometimes in an
ungainly fashion and you event-
ually get to a point where you
realize you're at an entirely dif-
ferent point than you started
from,” he said.

Sophomore Todd Eades ex-
plained it as “feeling closer to
the people in the group and peo-
ple in general. You tend to see
people as regular people like
yourself with problems and de-
sires..and goals and frustra-
tions. ” .

Cecil Burney, chairman of the

SGA psychology fund, added, ‘‘It
is a feeling that encourages peo-
ple to be more flexible and spon-
taneous. It gives you a chance
to express your real feelings
and meet people on a deeper
level.” ~

Most of the Davidson students
who have attended one of the
groups seem to feel that the ex-
perience was worthwhile but
does not cause any dramatic
turnabout in life style.

Senior Steve Cross said ‘‘No
one was in any sense cured of
anything that was wrong, but
we were at least able to face
up to our problems and we re-
solved to do something about it.
I came away feeling that I got
a load off of my chest.”

While admitting its overall
value there were also some res-
ervations among Davidson stu-
dents.

The imtensity of the group
Freshman Ken Fabert was in
disturbed him. “‘It got almost
laborious because it was so in-
tensive and extensive. You felt
forced to talk so a lot of times
the talk was contrived. You had
to say things about people when
you had nothing to say.”

The future of encounter groups
at Davidson is somewhat uncer-
tain. This year they were fund-
ed by the student government
and the Union Board.

Next year’s funding is expect-
ed to come partially from the
college as well as from the
Board and Siudent government.
Hall is quite willing to continue
Zroups here, and he sees their
value as being especially great
at a school like Davidson.

“At a school like Davidson
you have an overabundance of
intellectual demand, you cater
to the intellect in almost every- —
thing. A place is needed where’
people can experience. tha:.they
have feelings. I'm completely .'
commifted to the idea of en-
counter groups.” .
