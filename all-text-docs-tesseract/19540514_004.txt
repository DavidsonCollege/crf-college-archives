FALL PLANS STATED

The first meeting of the 1954-55
Student Council was held on May
12. The election of the Court of
Control for the coming year was
undertaken first. Elected to be
the judge was Harry Peterson, and
the recorder will be John Buxton.
The senior class representatives
will be Harley Smith and Henry
Brown. Representing the junior
class will be Dick Adams and John
M. McLauchlin, and chosen from
the sophomore class were Dick
Belton and Bill Gramley.

President Feeney outlined his
plans for the coming year. Com-
mittees were set up to start work
immediately on the program which
Feeney set forth in his campaign
speech. The Constitution Commit-
tee was appointed to study the
Constitution article by article and
see what changes and improve-
ments should be made. The chair-
man of this committee will be
Perrin Anderson. The members ap-
pointed were Charlie Rankin,
Linny Baker, John Child, Clark
Reed and Swain Loy. __

A second committee was ap-
pointed to study the problem of
student-faculty relations. Chairman
of the Student-Faculty Relations
Committee is Kiki Lewis, and the
members are Hobby Cobb, Stuart
Vaughn, and Corky King.

Two other committees were set
up. On the Chapel Committee are
Charlie Cousar, chairman, and the
members are Joe Conaroe and
Buddy Dye. This committee wil)
see what improvements if any can
be made in the present chapel
situation. Tom Newton was ap-
pointed to work on the infirmary
problem. His job will be to see
what improvements are needed and
to see what can be done about
carrying them out.

EAST, WEST DORMS

mer. Mrs. R. A. Little, supervisor

fortable quarters, the larger dormi-
tory has been opened instead of
Georgia. West Dormitory, as pre-
viously scheduled, will also be
open.

The action of the Trustees at com-
mencement, after hearing the re-
port of their committee on ath-
letics, will be interesting to see.

(5) The active pursuit of the
spirit found in the proposed
amendments to the Student Body
Constitution. Now is not the time
for half-way measures, but a full
investigation should reveal what
the students and the college want
and need.

(6) Investigation into the advisa-
bility of second semester or sopho-
more year rushing. This is not the
advocacy of that change, but now
we can begin to see the effect of
not having the freshmen in the
boarding houses.

() An analysis into the pay
structure for student offices on
the campus. Money-wise the presi-
dent of the Interfraternity Coun-
cil, the Editor and the Business
Editor of the annual come off
pretty well. No one else gets any-

thing.

My final conclusion on Davidson
is possibly more prosaic than
pragmatic, At Davidson there are
no revolutions—only revelations.

Reports

On Year’s ¥Y Work

By PRES. CHARLIE WILLIAMS

Let me preface this report with
two comments:

First, this is simply to inform
the student members of the year’s
program and to give it thereby a
note of finality.

Secondly, I trust that the report
will be read in the context of
evaluative remarks presented by
me in chapel, Thursday, May 6.

New Activities

Both the cabinet and board have
sought to gear the program more
directly to the needs of the col-
lege community while continuing
the program to the larger Church
and secular community. To that
end, the following has been done:

1) Organization of a Freshman
Y Council to provide more con-
crete means for participation in re-
ligious activity and for self ex-
pression through study and work.

2) Adoption of the Student Vol-
unteer Movement into the Y to
provide expression of the mis-
sionary enterprise of the Church.

3) Establishment of a Summer
Placement Service to locate stu-
dents in work situations providing
both educational and spiritual ex-
periences.

4) Enlargement of the social pro-
gram to. provide planned and
leisure time entertainment at little
or no cost in such forms as dances
and dinners.

5) Planning of forums to enhance
student understanding of socio-
political, economic, and religious
problems as well as for discussion
of pertinent campus issues.

6) Invited the University Chris-
tian Missions to help in the plan-
ning and sponsoring of a week of
religious emphasis in early 1955 to
replace the traditional spring and
fall services. This new program will
utilize educational and study ap-
proaches and a larger force of com-
petent leadership.

Reguler Services

In addition, the regular activ-
ities of the posts chairmen have
continued:

Gift Fund: Netted $3800 in the
1953 drive to move, entarge, and
equip the Y “hut” located in the
Negro community. The work will
conclude this summer.

Special Services: Sponsored the
Fall Services, headed by Dr.
Dockery, the Spring Services
headed by “Chuck” Templeton, the
special Christmas Vespers and the
Easter Sunrise Service.

Scouting and Boys Work: Organ-
ized two new troops, one new cub
den and sponsored four boys’ clubs
and one older boys basketball team.

Chapel: Planned the Y's Thurs-
day morning worship services,
utilizing student leadership, and
the voluntary worship services dur-
ing exam periods.

Bible Class: Experimented with
systematic and purposeful Bible
study and group discussion.

Publications: Printed the 1953
Wildcat Handbook and is complet-
ing the 1954 book with complete
renovation.

Spiritual Life: Sponsored the
Wednesday evening hall prayer
services; prepared and distributed
the devotional booklet, Daily De-
votions.

Deputations and Sunday School
Extension: Placed men in preaching
and teaching positions every week
in near-by areas, using a large
number of students.

Community: Performed some
of the most promising work of the
year in its activity with the
Negroes of the community.

The Cabinet

The cabinet has met twice
monthly and in a large number of
informal sessions to plan and dis-
cuss the program. It is presenting
to the Board of Trustees a formal
resolution calling for a definite
statement of college policy regard-
ing entertainment of interracial
groups on the campus. The Y sent
11 men to a United Nations semi-
nar in New York last fall; one stu-
dent will be working after school
in a Summer Service Project also
in New York, and from 4 to 6 men
will be attending the Southern
Area Conference at Blue Ridge in
early June.

The program for the year has
been full but inadeyuate in many
areas. Yet I commend, and ex-
press profound gratitude to each
man of the retiring cabinet for his
contribution to the program.

sibility than Amendment One.

Its defeat will be a frank avowal,
of the frequent faculty taunt that
we are incapable of shouldering
responsibility. Its passage, with
the others, will be a challenge of
no little significance to those
whose apparent conviction it is
that the Davidson student cannot
or will not think for himself.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

In conclusion, let us frankly ad-
mit that we cannot legislate away
our human tendency to err, and
that we cannot make any “system”
perfect or perfectly pleasant, but
let us also assume our obligation to
do the best with what we have and
to make improvements where we
can, and quickly, lest with a “dying
controversy” dies student govern-
ment as well, and it and a student
year come to an end, “not with a
bang, but a whimper.”
