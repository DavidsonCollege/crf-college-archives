Men’s basketball tops Elon for fourth straight win

Erege, Bree score 16 as Wildcats muster just enough offense to hold on

By Matt GarFIELD

Emeka Erege has seen more than his
fair share of Davidson basketball games
over the years—but too often from the
bench.

The fifth-year senior from-Nigeria has
missed parts of four seasons with inju-
ries. But with Erege, a 6-5 forward,
healthy through the first five games of
the year, the Wildcats are on a roll.

In Tuesday night’s 66-59 win over
Elon at Belk Arena, Erege scored 16

points, grabbed 11 rebounds and made
three steals to lead the Wildcats (4-1) to
their fourth straight victory since a sea-
son-opening loss to Charlotte.
“Emeka’s healthy, put it that way,”
said senior point guard Michael Bree,

‘who added 16 points and five assists.

“The healthier he gets, the better we can
be. [have no doubt that if he stays healthy,
he’s going to be a force in the confer-
ence.”

Several Davidson players were still
banged up after Saturday’s grueling 81-

79 home win over Navy, leaving David-
son coach Bob McKillop concerned that
fatigue might come into play.

“I was very frightened coming into
this game,” said McKillop. “Navy wore
us down. That put me in a bit of a tizzy
knowing how athletic this Elon team is.
We struggle when we’re outmatched
quickness-wise at all five spots.”

The Wildcats mustered just enough
offense to hold off the Phoenix (3-5),
converting four straight free throws in
the last 22 seconds after Elon closed the

lead to 62-59.

With the loss, Elon drops to 4-31 on
the road since joining the. Division I
ranks in 1999, The Phoenix played with-
out leading scorer Brendon Rowell, a
former Charlotte Providence Day star
who is suspended indefinitely for violat-
ing team rules.

Davidson opens Southern Conference
play at The Citadel at 1 p.m. on Saturday
and travels to St. Bonaventure on Dec.
15. The next home game is at 7 p.m. on
Dec. 17 against Washington & Jefferson.

Despite four individual
wins, Wildcats not able
to notch team victory

Individuals can’t win team competitions.
The Davidson wrestling team learned this
lesson on Saturday, after opening its regular
season with a frustrating 30-13 loss to Ander-
son College. Despite four individual wins,
the Wildcats couldn’t put the finishing
touches on a team victory.

Senior Jeff Bender explains, “We gave up
too many points to win. With a forfeit, a
disqualification, and two pins, that’s 24 of
their 30 points. We won 4 of 9 matches, but
it looks like a blowout.”

Senior Jeff Storms began the match in the
197-pound division against Josh Hawkins.
Though suffering from a knee injury, Storms
prevailed in the third period, using a rever-
sal to score two points, winning the match,
2-0.

“We are impressed with Jeff Storms,”
said Bender. “Coming out of an injury,
