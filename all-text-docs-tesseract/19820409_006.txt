Women‘s Center to

Be Union Committee

Next Year

The Kimmel House, currently the site
of the Women’s Center, will be just
another perimeter house next year. A
proposal to form a Women’s Concerns
Committee on the Union Board to take
its place was accepted at the Board
meeting on April 2, according to Lisa
Brawley (’82).

Lisa was the informal head of the
Women’s Center this year. She submit-
ted the proposal for the new committee
after discussing the matter with Asso-
ciate Dean of Students Sue Ross and
other interested people, she said. “They
expressed earlier in the year that they
thought there might be a better way to
serve the needs of the campus.” She
continued, “It was decided that a Union
Board Committee would be more effi-
cient for communication reasons.” In-
terested students include Sherburne
Laughlin, Betsy Thomas, and Elizabeth
McMillan. The Women’s Center was

originaly formed in response to a desire
to discuss issues pertaining to women,
as well as the fact that “women did not
have as many chances in the housing
lottery ,” according to Bill Bolding, Stu-
dent Housing Director. “I don’t think
women will be losing very much by los-
ing the Kimmel House at this stage,” he
added.

There were so few applicants that
the house was not filled at the beginning
of the year, Lisa said-The Center was
started in 1980 and first recieved fund-
ing from the Activities Tax Council this
year, she said.

If it had not been replaced by the
committee, there was a good chance
that it may not have been funded by the
Housing Office. next year, Lisa said.
The committee will obtain funds by
virtue of being a part of the Union
Board.

“Originally, the idea of a Women’s

Center excited me because it is so unlike
Davidson College — usually Davidson
is a very conservative place — but now
I’m somewhat frustrated,” Lisa said.
There were five active members at the
beginning of the year, and the Center
published two newsletters entitled “Air-
borne,” she said.

The Women’s Center “was ignored”
by the campus, and after a time,
members “lost their motivation,” she
said. “As a building, a place where peo-
ple live, the Women’s Center does not
meet the needs of the campus. A Wom-
,en’s Concerns Committee: has more

“credibility, ” Lisa said.

“Publicity and visibility are very im-
portant. If the committee gets interest
generated, then maybe there could be a
full-time thing” in the future, she said.
“T think there might be enough interest
later. I'd like to see it as a community
center (rather that solely College spon-
sored). That would be more exciting-

... There is so much more to being a
woman than being a student.”

“It is funny that at Davidson Col-
lege, the people still ask whether we
need a Women’s Center, but at other
campuses, it is assumed,” she said.

ATCto Set Budgets Next Week

The Activities ‘Tax Council (ATC),
which allocates money from the student
activities tax to various organizations,
will meet April 22-23 to discuss how
this year’s funds will be distributed, ac-
cording to Business mianeaee Bob Cur-
rie.

Twelve organizations receive their
funding from the ATC. These include
student publications and student organi-
zations: such as the SGA, BSC, and
DCF...

The heads of the organizations must
submit last year’s approved budget

along with their actual expenditures for.

the year for the Council to determine
how this’ year’s funds are to be allocat-
ed.

Despite complaints frotn Quips and
Cranks and the Davidsonian that they
were underbudgeted, the. ATC will not
increase the total amount of allocations
this year, according to Mr. Currie.

» Danny Waddill,. chairman. of. the

ATC, said that although there would be ©
no increase in the tax this year, there

might be one next year:

There will be some other changes in

the distribution of funds, however. Ac-
cording to member Lisa Brawley, the
Women’s Center will no longer be
funded by the ATC and will become a
Union committee instead. Brawley said
that since it will be funded by the Union
Board it will not ask for any money from
the. ATC. The Women’s. Center re-
ceived $750 last year.
Also the student carrier current radio,

WDSR, has folded and will not:receive
any’ money. WDSR received $1,000

‘last year.

The activities tax, which is paid by

" students’ in their tuition, amounts to
$48,500 or $45 per student, according ..

to Currie. A reserve of unused funds

that has accumulated over the years is —

available if necessary, Currie said.
As for the various organizations, most

plan to request the same amount of

funding or more than last year. Except
for the last few years, the Quips and
Cranks budget has. been. very small in
the past, according to co-editor Jim
Reese. He would like to see the ‘in-

creased funding continue. Reese also
noted that the yearbook facilities and
supplies are less than adequate. “We on-

ly have one typewriter, and it doesn’t

work.”

_ Hobart Park editor Dave Banks is also ~
concerned about the funding situation.

He said that although Hobart Park ended
up-in the black this year, it needed to
borrow money left over from last year.
He said he turned away about 50 per
cent of the material he received and next

. year the magazine may have to turn

away as much as 70 percent if it doesn’t
get enough money to put out two issues.
He concluded, “I don’t think that’s what
we want from a college literary maga-
zine.’
SGA president Tim Johnston, was not

gure if the SGA’ s request would be

larger than last year but he was sure that
it wouldn’t be less. The Residence Hall

Council, accordng to Burt Taylor, re- .

ceived no money last year and they will
ask for some this year, calen| he is.

- not sure how much. . =.
