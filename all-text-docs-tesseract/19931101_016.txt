Serebrennikov lectures about images of women in art and ads

By Kristin Garris

Before phone directories were
even printed this year, the Com-
mittee for Women's Issues had
planned a lecture to discuss picto-
rial images of women.

Art History professor Nina
Serebrennikov led a discussion of
“Images of Women in Art and
Advertising” on Tuesday, October
26.

The event, held in the lecture
hall of the new Visual Arts center
and sponsored by the Committee
for Women’s Issues, attracted 43
students and one professor.

Dr. Serebrennikov began the
discussion by juxtaposing an im-
age of a woman photographed by
Walker Evans in the 1930s with an
image of model Kate Moss in a
well-known Calvin Klein adver-
* tisement.

She spoke of the underlying
messages relayed by the images,
of what these images say about
women, and of the control em-
ployed by artists in the ways they
choose to convey images of

women.

In describing the ways. in
which women have been portrayed,
predominantly by male artists,
throughout the history of art, Dr.
Serebrennikov used images of
paintings by Raphael, Titian,
Caravaggio, Fragonard,,Courbet,

] Renoir, Picasso, de Kooning, and

others.

She contrasted two portrayals
of the same Biblical scene of Judith
and Holofernes; one was painted
by the male artist Caravaggio and
one was painted by the female art-
ist Artemisia Gentileschi.

The female artist deliberately
portrayed a strong female figure,
while the male artist portrayed a
seemingly timid and weaker fe-
male figure.

Advertisements for products
such as men’s cologne, handbags,
haircolor treatments, and clothing
were discussed concerning their
portrayals of women and the mes-
sages conveyed to both male and
female viewers.

Finally Serebrennikov com-"

pared examples of the pop art of
Roy Lichtenstein with the image
found on the front of the 1993-94
Davidson telephone directory.
Some in the Davidson community
have found the image offensive to
females at Davidson; some feel it
is inappropriate, but not offensive.
Others do not see any problem
with the picture.

A few students noted that they
were neither aware of the style of
Lichtenstein’s pop art nor of the
reference to Dr. Sam Spencer, who
was president of Davidson Col-
lege in 1973 when the college first
admitted full time female students.

Some students who were both
aware of the pop art style and the
meaning of “Sam” still found the
directory image offensive because
they believe it does not present an
acceptable image of women at
Davidson and does not connote
respect for the celebration of twenty
years of women at Davidson.

Editor's note: The directory issue
is discussed in opinions.
