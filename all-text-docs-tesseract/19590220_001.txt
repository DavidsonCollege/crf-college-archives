LAB SUCCESS MEANS LEARNING

So commented white-haired
philanthropist Charles Dana as
he sat outdoors in the warm
February afternoon on a stone
bench in front of the Guest
House and conversed in an easy
manner with a DAVIDSONIAN
staff member last Wednesday.

The new Dana Seience Build-
ing was his chief interest.

“The contractors are doing
a very good job. The drainage
and sewage are completed

in about a week they’‘ll be
able to hang the electric
wiring after a few more bas-

ie fixtures are laid.”

“The next thing, of course,
is getting the new dormitory
under way. Then, there are the
details of furnishing each
building.” Dana also expressed
interest in the Cunningham
Fine Arts Building to be erect-
ed near Shearer Hall.

Mr. Dana then -zgave his
views on Davidson College.

Highlight of his stay was
the presentation of a cita-
tion given to him by the
Trustees and Faculty ex-
pressing their appreciation
for the service he is render-

ing to the college.

The citation, composed
by Dr. Ernest Beaty, com-
mended Mr. Dana on his
many varied achieve-
ments and  accomplish-
ments, praising him as a
lawyer, industrialist, phil-
anthropist, humanitarian,

cognized as a friend of

terested in scientific and

Elections Amendments

Go To Student Body

The student council has proposed changes in the/turned out at the Saturday eve-
student body constitution which are designed to stream-
line elections procedure and boost lagging student inter-

est.

President John Kuykendall,

in a special student body meet-
ing at chapel on Tuesday, out-
lined proposed amendments
which would authorize the
grouping of elections in some
areas, eliminating the long pro-
cess of separate elections, and
to make two offices appointive
rather than clective.

The changes would establish
a new five-phase order of elec-
tions. Student body officers
would be elected first. followed
by members of the Honor
Court, as in the present pro-
cedure.

Following respectively
would come three elections
phases: class presidents in
the third phase; freshman ad-
viser, publications editors

and YMCA officers elected
simultaneously in the fourth

phase, and student council
representatives in the fifth.
Cheerleader and athletic
council representatives would
in the new system be appoint-
ed by the student council.

The recommended changes, '
which will be voted upon by
students after a ten-day wait-
ing period, were recommended
this
month. Last fall, with the ap-

dall appointed a student com-
mittee to study and recom-
