celebration at PAX

By JIM DILLON

Two purses _— containing
cameras and a total of $400 were
stolen during a party last Friday at
PAX. .

PAX social chairman Kendra
Carré hid her purse which con-
tained $300 of PAX social money
budgeted for homecoming
weekend, $100 of herown money
and a camera under a box in a stor-
age closet in the basement of the
house after partially paying the
band present at the party at 2:15
a.m. last Friday, according to
Holly Sparks, PAX president.

At 2:30 a.m. Carr went to get
her purse to pay the band the rest
of theic money but discovered that
the purse was gone. It was also
discovered that a jacket, a mug
and Sparks’ purse which con-
tained a camera were missing.

The robbery at PAX was one
of a number of robberies that oc-
curred on campus during
Homecoming weekend. Chief se-
curity officer Jackie Hughes was

unavailable for comment on the
robberies.

The college police were con-
tacted concerning the. incident at
PAX, and all of the stolen items
were reported. Currently only
Sparks’ purse has been found. It
‘was discovered behind the Black
Student Coalition house, and her
camera was missing.

“I'm positive it wasn’t a

.Davidson student who did it,”

Carr said. “J have some clues, but
there’s no way of proving it.”
Carr said three people, not
from Davidson, were seen in the
storage closet, but it was thought
that they were looking for a ping
pong batl. Carr said she suspects
people from Lafayette College
who were present at the party were
actually guilty of the theft, hat she
said the number of people on cam-
pus for Homecoming weekend
makes it hard to identify. the
people.
“There was just less control on
who was where, and people were

less aware than usual,” Carr said.
“We had 22 ahimni come back,
and some people didn’t know who
they Were, and there were people
from Lafayette there, and so there
were just lots of people who were
unidentifiable. They could have
been alumni. They could have
been Lafayette people. They
could have been townies. Who
knows?"

The sole money should not
‘affect the PAX social budget be-

cause the $300 of PAX’s money
was intended for Homecoming
and was money that had not been
spent, according to Carr. Sparks
said mohey was gathered to pay
the band the remaining portion of
their fee.

“It wasn't like. I left it lying
about,” Casr said. I¢ was under-
neath a box under a chair in a re-
stricted past of the house which
means that everyone down there
was 21, “That eliminates most of

_ Davidson. It’s just frustrating.”

East German parliment members visit campus

By NELLE MCCORKLE

Five East German parliament
members visited Davidson Mon-
day as part of a cultural exchange
tour sponsored by the U.S. Infor-
mation Agency through the State
Depariment.

Elected to the German Demo-
cratic Republic Volkskammer, or
People’s Chamber, these par:
liamentary members belong to an
East German young leaders’
group and tange in age from 29-
39. They represent different geo-
graphic areas of the country.

Arranged by Charlotte’s Inter-
national House through Dean
Rusk Program. di Jack
Perry, the Davidsarr’visit. consti-
tuted part of a three-week. Ameri-
can tour including stops in Char-
lotte, Minneapolis, New York
City, Sacramento,
"Washington, D.C. The group tra-
vels with a State Department

and.

translator/guide.

While in Davidson, the East
Germans toured campus infor-
mally and attended a reception
with German-speaking students
and faculty at the Carolina Inn.

Political science professor
Louis Ortmayer, who helped
Perry plan the visit, said, “Our
Purpose was to introduce them to a.
small private college, a type of
education they don't have in East
Germany, where all higher educa-
tion is state-funded and state-
ren.”

Orimayer invited seniors who
participated in Davidson’s Mar-
burg jonior year abroad program
during 1985-86 to mect the East
Germans. He said, “From my per-
spective, it was particularly fortu-
mate that we have the type of stu-
dent wha can do this on Sport
notice — meeting foreigners and
conversing with them in their lan—

guage.”

Senior Mike Ladd traveled in
East Germany last year while a
student at Marburg. He said of
Monday's visitors, “Although
they may have been a little ap-
prehensive, we were able to talk
very frankly and on a wide variety
of subjects. Both sides enjoyed
the afternoon tremendously, and
we were at complete ease with one

-another. They were very friendly

eo

and eager to keep in touch later
on.”

“Conversations were gener-
ally one-on-one, including every-
thing from our college education
system to the price of attending
Patterson Court to the nuclear
arms race to the mini-summit to
the role of women in socialist
coumtries,"" senor Sonia
Daugherty said,

The college released no cam-
pus-wide advance publicity an-

nouncing the East Germans’ visit.
“We wanted them to stroll around
just like they were visitors to the
cmapus, not like some staged
event. That's why what we did
was successful. They seemed very
grateful for the chance to converse
openly and informally with stu-
dents and faculty at the college,”
Ortamyer said. .

Regarding East Germans’ im-
pressions of Davidson, Ortmayer
said, “I think they found it inter-
esting in its contrast to what
they’re used to and fascinating in
its almost rural setting. They were
also very impressed by the facili-
ties — like the Commons which
they just couldn’t get over as a stu-
dent cating place.”

None of the East German dele-
gation visiting Davdison had pre-
viously traveled to the United
States, except one cross-country

skiing gold medalist at the 1980
Lake Placid Winter Olympics,
Ortmayer said, “Their perceptions
of us are conditioned by the Cold
War, the Berlin Wall, by the ten-
sions in Europe over nuclear arms
and simply by their different sys-
tem, their communist system
there.”

Conversation occurred in Ger-
mun because only one Gast Ger-
man visitor spoke ‘Enplish.
Ortmayer said of Perry, “In the
end, he found himself conversing
with one visitor in Russian.”

Other faculty purticipants im-

cluded German professors Doug-

Jas Stott and Mark McCulloh, his-
tory professor Earl Edmondson,
and Vice President for Academic
Affairs, Dean of Faculty and
hisotry professor Robert Wil-
liams.
