Director of the Union William Brown says that, “In the days when this building was a library, the floor that is now the balcony went

Decimal system.” : 4
When the Grey Library was being converted to what is today’s College Union, “they knocked out the floor to open the room up
___and to create the space we haye now,” Brown says. aia sinaiamiahiaiasamminiciaaiaaaiacieaiiini eae
Then when it came time to dedicate the new space, Brown says “some great soul had the idea that we call it the 900 Room." as ne

is known today. — Compiled by Randy Hartwell
