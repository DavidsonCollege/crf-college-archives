Freshman hall deemed unpractical

By MARC MENCHEL
Guest Columnist

At Davidson College, the institu-
tion of-the freshman hall is as sacred
as the Presbyterian Church. A slight
exaggeration? So what?

The point is that, at Davidson,
members of the college community
often blindly accept various compo-
nents of the status quo, which, upon
reflection may not make sense. The
concept of the freshman hall is such a
component which makes no sense.

The freshman hall supposedly
makes the transition to college as
easy as possible. In fact, one might
find the freshman hall a debilitating
agent, perhaps responsible for several
problems which plague our campus.

When a student comes to Davidson
he is greeted by two ‘“‘highly trained’’
hall counselors. These people are
neither highly trained nor counselors.
In fact, the best service they perform
is to bullshit Mom and Dad about
Davidson during orientation.

Most hall counselors would be in
trouble if they had to rely upon their
sparse training when dealing with
freshman problems, surely, most rely
on common sense. Common sense is
something that many, if not all,
students bring with them to David-
son.

The majority of freshmen don't
need counselors when they come to
Davidson. Ah, but what of those
freshmen who do? First, I shall

Opinion

Freshman hall concept advantages outweigh criticism |

Defending a college policy demands
more than attacking that policy.
Human nature continually ‘accentua-
tes the negative in reality and the
positive in the ideal. The grass does
seem greener on the other side. We at
Davidson intuitively perceive the
disadvantages of the freshman hall
and hall counselor programs while
often ignoring the very real advan-
tages of our present set-up.

discuss the debilitating effects of the
freshman hall. Secondly, I shall
outline the alternative living situation
for freshmen which, I submit, will
take care of everyone’s counseling
needs.

The freshman hall is a womb-like
environment. Some hall counselors do
everything but burp and tuck in their
boys and girls. Freshmen need make
no effort to find out anything about
Davidson once here, all one need do is
simply ask your friendly hall coun-
selor. Hall counselors are told to be
the paragons of virtue.

The hall counselor will take a
freshman by the hand to the dean, a
professor, and to his first mixer.
What is wrong with this panacea?
There are three things wrong. First of
all the womb-like hall creates the
future apathetic student.

During his freshman year, the
student is hid from some of the
ugliness that exists at Davidson.
Everything is cushioned for the
student during his first year here,
therefore a freshman develops this
apathy because he is rarely confron-
ted with any controversy which exists
even at our campus.

Secondly, the calm of freshman
year makes sophomore slump that
more pronounced for many people.
The halo effect of being a freshman is
quite a contrast when one returns to
start the second year at Davidson.

There is no ‘more hall counselor who

can serve as a crutch for those weak of
character.

Finally, I suspect the freshman hall
to be the culprit for some very strange
patterns of socialization here at
Davidson. During your freshman year
you tend to socialize with people
primarily on your own hall. The
problem with this is that many people
fall into the habit of socializing only
with the people that you live with.

Upperclassmen, ask yourselves if
there are not people you once lived
with, who you were once friendly

with, but whom you don’t see much
anymore because you don’t live in the
same dorm with them. Now ask
yourselves if that is not strange in
light of how small Davidson College
is.

Is not the lack of cohesiveness of
this campus of 1300 amazing? Not
really when you consider the cohe-
siveness of the freshman hall which
fosters this attitude, that is, the
attitude of socializing only with those
with whom you live.

“There has always been a -
myth that I have chosen the
hall counselors,”’ said Dean of
Students Will Terry. ‘‘That is
not true.”’

A committee of Terry, As-
sistant Dean of Students
Mary Lou Dietler, Director of
Housing Scotty Nicholls, the
freshmen advisors for the up-
coming year and five students
selected by the freshmen ad-
visors choose the hall counse-
lors, according to Terry.

““Ourmain objective is to
get thekinds of people who
will set the kinds of examples
that help freshmen learn and

Surveys were distributed
this week to four of the eating
houses— Richards, PAX,
ATO, and Emanon—concer-
ning the freshman hall. Al-
though the survey was not
representative and the res-
ponse was not overwhelming,
we feel that the results are
worthy of consideration.

One hundred and fourteen
students responded. .

Those in favor of freshman
Halls: 91

Those in favor of mixed
class halls: 15

Those in favor of one-sex
freshman dorms: 76

Those not in favor of one-
sex freshman dorms: 35

Those who liked the hall

Small sample surveyed

counselor program: 100

Those who used their hall

Those who felt they needed
hall counselors: 77

Those who felt they didn’t
need hall counselors: 26

There were a variety “of
responses to the question,
‘What did you ‘use your hail
counselor for?’’ Most students
said that they used their hall

counselor as a source of infor- ©

mation about academics.

For many, the hall counse-
lor became a friend the student
could turn to for advice about

_ personal problems. A number

of students said that the hall
counselor provided a means of
meeting upperclassmen.

Uther comments included:
‘‘My hall counselor helped
protect us against irate upper- :
class pre-meds when we made
too much ndise,’’ ‘‘My hall
counselor got|me drunk for the
first time,” ’My hall counse-
lor taught me to hate SPE’s,”’
‘“‘My hall counselor taught me
how to spike watermelons with
rum,” ‘‘I used my hall counse-
lor for entertainment,’’ ‘‘I
used my hall counselor as a
target for water balloon
fights,’’ ‘I used my hall
counselor for unnatural acts,”’
“T used my hall counselor to
buy dope,” and “‘I can’t
remember what I used my hall
counselor for—it was certainly
nothing monumental.”

Freshman halls bring fresnmen
together.. Admittedly some very real
disadvantages to such an arrange-
ment exist, but the advantages are far
more significant.

Consider your first few weeks at
Davidson. How many students did
you know before you came? The
adjustment from a home environment
to the widely acclaimed ‘Davidson
Experience’ will continue to be a
mixed bag. Leaving a family and
long-time friends can be as difficult as
it is exciting.

Such an adjustment requires the
support of others who are having to
face the same set of-issues. Freshmen
have nothing in common with each
other than with upperclassmen. They
need each other to grow. There is
value in facing hardships together
and in sharing the good as well as the

bad.

The greatest help for an adjusting
freshman is the example and support
of other freshmen. Very seldom will
all the freshmen on a hall be facing the
same problem. The similarity of the
situation, however, allows them to
work together for one another.

The second important aspect of the
freshman hall is the hall counselor.
Hall counselors will remain essential
if Davidson continues the freshman
hall. A freshman hall occasionally
illustrates quite nicely the parable of
the blind leading the blind with
predictable results. Here the hall
counselor can comprehend and inter-
pret the vast unknown to the fresh-
men, steering them clear of the many
ditches along the way.

Hall counselors serve as traffic
controllers directly freshmen with

problems to areas of help and problem
freshmen to Will. The complex pro-
cess of socialization into Davidson
culture is primarily facilitated by the
hall counselor who provides informa-
tion and comfort for the freshman,

Perhaps the most important func-
tion of the hall counselor, however, is
to initiate and integrate the freshman
class into the rest of the college
community.

Freshman halls serve to bring the
freshman together, giving them the
opportunity to develop relationships
that can last the remainder of their
time at Davidson. Hall counselors
initiate the freshmen into the main-
stream of college life. The two work
together to help each class develop its
own sense of identity and to integrate
that class into the rest of the college
community.
