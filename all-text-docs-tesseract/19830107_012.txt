ROXY MUSIC: Avalon (Warner
Bros./E.G.):

- Bryan Ferry writes some of the
most lush and moving melodies re-
corded today. Yet he is equally adept
with more rhythmic sounds that must
propel the listener to dance. And that
is the key to the Roxy Music sound for
the 80’s — fantastically lush melo-
dies sustained by driving danceable
polyrhythms. On “Avalon”, this
combination should garner the group
the success it’s never found in Ameri-
ca.

Roxy Music broke up in 1977, af-
ter a “trial separation” that allowed
each member to pursue individual
projects. They reformed one year lat-
er to record “Manifesto”, a good ef-
fort that showed, albeit with little
flair, that the group had not changed
its musical format. Change was soon
to come, though. In 1980 the band re-
leased “Flesh & Blood”, and left the
raw energy of rock behind (emphasis
on raw). They infused their material
instead with an energy that comes
from complex rhythms defined by a
sion rather than competing with it. In
fact, on some songs the bass line is its
own distinct melody which still helps
maintaini a surging rhythm. Roxy
Music’s customarily compelling ma-
terial became even more pleasant to
hear when the album was remixed at
New York’s Power Station studios

Method):

Hard core punk from Jerry’s
Kids, the Groinoids, the F.U.’s,
Gang Green, Decadence, and the
Freeze. This is a compilation of thirty
tunes that blew the roof off my mobile
home. The unavoidable crap is more
than compensated for by the incredi-
ble energy level here, and by the spe-

ific contributions of the F.U.’s (4
:.ongs), the Freeze (8 songs), and the
Proletariat (3 songs). ‘Options’ (Pro-

stariat), ‘Green Beret’ (F.U.’s),
‘Sacrifice Not Suicide’ and ‘It’s Only
Alcohol’ (both, the Freeze) are minor
classics of modern punk. “Trouble if
You Hide’ is a classic in any genre.
(It’s by the Freeze, and establishes
them as the best band on this record.)

If you want to get in on what's
happening on the edge of East Coast
American rock, get this album. High-
ly recommended, but not for every-
one.

Brian Ferry Surges Again

(something which had never been
done). Every beat, every note is crisp
and clear. “Flesh & Blood” became
one of the few rock records that could
overwhelm the listener with the beau-
tyof its sound.

“Avalon” is much the same —
different only in that it may be a little
more seductive. Guitarist Phil Man-
zanera can deliver a fiery instrumen-
tal attack, but here he is lyrical, and
occasionally haunting on such cuts as
‘More than This’ and ‘Take a Chance
with Me’. Equally moving are the
rhapsodic solos by saxophonist Andy
Mackay. But the real star (of course)
is Bryan Ferry, who wrote seven of
the ten tunes here and co-wrote the
other three. His keyboard work is
governed throughout by a subtle in-
tensity that suggests fantasy and an
ethereal sensation, particularly on the
title cut. His clear tenor voice is well
suited to the material, which Ferry
sings in his customary cool, man-
nered style.

Ferry once failed an audition for
King Crimson. Fortunately, he went
on to found Roxy Music, which even-
tually became one of the most in-
fluential bands of the 70’s. With the

' release of “Avalon” and its predeces-

sor “Flesh & Blood”, the group may
find itself repeating that act in the
80’s. One may hope.

THE JIM CARROLL BAND: Dry
Dreams (Atco):

This album proves that “Catholic
Boy” was no fluke. Jim Carroll is a
genius. While there’s nothing here as
immediately ear-grabbing as ‘People
Who Died’, the entire LP is a stronger
effort than was “CB”. No filler, and
maybe five excellent songs. ‘Barri-
cades’ is the album’s tour-de-force,
and it’s better than ‘City Drops into
the Night’ from “CB”. ‘Still Life’,
“Work Not Play’, ‘Evangeline’, and

New Dylan

is almost

commercial

maybe ‘Dry Dreams’ are the other
great tunes.

The band is essentially new with
only the rhythm section still intact. It
might be argued that “DD” rocks a lit-
tle less than did “CB”, but if so the
music is a litthe more mature — as is
Carroll’s lyricism and voice control
(both devastating).

(Carroll’s neo-Dylanesque vocals
and pseudo-hardcore stance may be
the only factors keeping him from a
major breakout in the commercial
sector.)
