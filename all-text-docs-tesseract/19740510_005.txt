In Spite of reassurance
(“The co-eds look like they
tried to kiss a Wells-Fargo
tank which was going West,

our place in the community.

Hopefully, the acceptance of
women students will be easier
every year. The housing shor-
tage has highlighted the
problems of co-education. Put-
ting women on 4th Belk is nice
for us, but hard on the male
students who are finding that
all the best rooms on campus
are now designated female
housing. Giving women the
advantage of housing may be

the easiest administrative

move, but it’s hardly fair.

If I had known what co-
education meant at Davidson,
would ‘I still have come? Yes.

take any particular skill
beyond being able to oc-
casionally lie without flin-
ching. Eating is an experience
common to all of us, and like
the weather can be discussed
by any moron. Higher minds
talk about people, and great
minds discuss ideas.

Basically, the column has
been a fun one to write, but I
get so (expletive omitted)
tired of people talking to me
about nothing but food. To
publicly answer the most
popular question, ‘‘No, the
restaurant do not give me free
meals.’’ On the financial end, I
have been aided by a research
grant that has picked up the
tabs on the forty-plus road
trips I have taken since Spring
Break.

But now back to food.
Eating for its own sake
generates hedonism (and
gout) faster than anything I
can think of. The three meals
plus snacks consumption
schedule that most of us fall
into tends to keep us from
thinking about what it means
to be able to eat.

hungry. And among

over twice the national
average. This is not a remote
situation. North Carolina is
probably second only to Texas
in the acuteness of the
problem.

But now back to eating. As a
human ritual, mealtimes
provide an inadvertant setting
for social interaction and
reflection that could never be
intentionally assimilated on a
massive scale. What all of this
means for anyone assessing a
restaurant is that the physical
and social environment is
primary, and the quality of the
food relevant mainly to the ex-
tent that it lends itself to this
environment.

With this in mind, any
would-be food critic needs
only to be willing to eat out a
few times each week. That can
really get to be a drag, unless
you are careful to always take
some friends along.

Most food critics end up
writing for the same audience
that scans the society column
looking for familiar names.
The sort of restaurant reviews
they write simply will not cut
it here. At Davidson, the

readership spread is much
broader, ranging from truck

to. You ain’t never seen one of:

Sometimes it is hard to work
irrelevant messages into the
context of a review. Take, for
instance, the cops down in
precinct 2, who have it among
themselves that we in North
Main House are growing
opium poppies in our garden.
We do have a little pokeweed
and several species of
leguminosae, but the only
opium I know of is
about 13 miles out Concord
Road. How do you relate that
to Sally’s Grill in Mooresville?

in terms of lives lost. On the other hand, the commission decided
not to locate a nuclear plant too close to the large urban center of
Philadelphia. What to believe about the safety asspects?

Studies by the Ford Foundation and a Senate subcommittee
have pointed out the grave dangers of radioactive materials in
the hands of people who could use them for bomb construction
and threats. The unsettled state of the world, with frequent
violence, skyjackings, and kidnappings, does not inspire con-
fidence in the proposals to greatly increase the availability of
the lethal matter.

For longer than man has had any culture, those 17,000
generations, the atomic wastes will persist into the future.
There is no way to dispose of them adequately. In the burial
vaults they refuse to die. In the light of this grim heritage for
future generations we question the wisdom of the agencies
making decisions for the world and its peoples.

But what about the objective scientists who can tell us the
facts in such matters? It all depends upon which scientific
testimony it pleases one to accept, and the AEC chooses to
believe the scientists who hold the views they do. Sweden elects
to believe those who see a grave danger in fission reactors,
declaring a moratorium on all such plants. The credibility gap is
everywhere evident.

Among the agents controlling developments in atomic energy
are the power companies. Our local company is asking for
higher rates, essentially to finance building nuclear plant
building. It projects future needs as doubling by the end of the
century and sees no way of supplying electricity other than
through fission plans. The position is clear but the credibility of
the company’s policy would be greater if much money were not
spent in assuring the public that all will be well with our own
friendly nuclear plants. An honest statement on business in-
terests and calculated risks to the public would be more
believable.

As a footnote we should observe that federal law gives power
companies large relief from legal responsibility for nuclear ac-
cidents, a law without which they would not consider getting into
the nuclear accidents, a law without which they would not con-
sider getting into the nuclear business. How credible are in-
dustry strtements?

Decisions are being made right now by a combination of
governmental agencies and a sector of private business which
will shape our future as nothing else probably ever has in world
history. Energy policy is a matter of life and death, for us and
our environment. The citizens are simply being told what is
decided for them, and this citizen for one, cannot believe that the
decisions are wise and true.

Credibility runs two ways, of course, and the government and
industry must try to decide what public sentiments or ut-
terances are believable. In the long run the people express their
beliefs through their actions, and in the matter of energy policy
their actions will tell the decision makers much about public

temper.
If credence is to be given to expressions of public concern,
ther. must be concomitant evidence of public

words. In to tome oe or the agents

tive protests are heard in places we will be committed to a
