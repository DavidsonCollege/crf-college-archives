“There are individuals in

needs people like this and will
benefit from their contribu-
tions.”

Included in this year's
freshman class are a greater
number of scholarship final-

“Many of these students,”
White said, ‘‘were accepted at
Eastern schools and faced
tremendous pressure to at-
tend there, but. they chose
Davidson instead.”’

The members of the Class
of ‘71 represent a broad geo-

boy is from England. and an-

Summer’s Toils
Add Innovation

By BOB DUNHAM
News Editor

The thoroughly modern Chambers Building was
unveiled to. Davidson students this week as they re-
turned to studies in the completely renovated main

classroom building.

The interior of the 40-year-old classroom building
was completely modernized. The wooden floors have
been replaced by multi-colored terazzo hallways;
acoustical tile has been installed on the ceilings; and

College Restaurant

a central air conditioning
and heating system has
taken the place of steam
radiators.

The changes in the central
college building are numer
able, and more changes will
be completed in the near fu-
ture. All the classrooms will
be furnished by early next
week: the air-conditioning
will be completely installed in
October: and a new elevator
will be installed in the rear
of Chambers by the first of
next year.

Classes promise to be much
more comfortable this year.
The new flooring will pre
vent the squeaking: new
fluorescent lighting will re-
place the old light fixtures;
and desks have been refinish-
ed.

Faculty offices have been
also remodeled. Carpeting.
new furniture and individual
telephones have been install-
ed. In addition. a new cen.
tral switchboard has been in
stalled to link all faculty and
administration offices.

The new Chambers is a
bullding of many colors.
Hallways on the first and
second floors are painted
mustard yetlow, while third
floor halls are lemon yel-
low. Offices and classrooms
are painted lemon yellow,
lime green, or turquoise.

The doors are painted a
bright red, and stairways
are with covered red rub-
ber treads.

your expressions of sympathy

“Work on éach publication
was beguh on an early enough
schedule to assure a proper
delivery.”’

The reference catalogue
was “crucially, critically
late."’ according to one ad-

ministration official. Director
of Admissions H. Edmunds
White said he had promised
to mail catalogues to incom-
ing freshmen in June. but
was unable to do so until
jate August.

According to Director of
Public Information Rassell
A. Strong, however, the
catalogue is not on a defin-
ite schedule.

He pointed to other com-
plications. “Every academic
department and every admin.
istrative office contributes to
the catalogue. We are. just
the collecting agency.”

Mike Mooty. -editor of the
Wildcat Handbook, said he
thought the handbook was
tardy because its cover, done
separately, was not ready
when the boek itself was fin-
ished.

Davidson Nears
Challenge Goal

Davidson College has rais-
ed $5 million of the $5.5 mil
lion needed to qualify for a
$2.2 million challenge grant
from the Ford Foundation.

This is the final year of
Davidson's participation in
the Ford Challenge program.
In a report issued recently
from the challenge program
co-chairmen, Walter L. Lin-
gle Jr. and William A. White,
it was stated that Davidson
needed only an additional
$433,088 to receive the grant.

The final deadline is June
30. 1968. All gifts must be
made and all pledges paid
by that date in order to meet
the terms of the challenge.

One visible result of the
progress made in the chal-
lenge is the recent renovation

of Chambers Building. Funds

from the grants have been
employed to remodel and air.
condition the 40-year old
classroom and ad a
lion building.

ready first and that type
setting was the chief prob
lem.

“I’m sorry that it was not
on time.’ Mooty said. ‘‘But
I still think it will be quite
helpful to both freshmen and
upperclassmen—we went to
great lengths to improve it.”

Both Strong and White
blamed the printer for the
admissions brochure’s de-
lay. They sald the printer
told them that he did not
have enough paper for the
Job and further, that the
printer could have checked
his supply a month before
he did.

“Something like that really
burns me up,” White said.

In the case of both the cata.
logue and the handbook, the
production was handled by
more than one printer, there-
by adding to the complica-
tions. Strong said.

According to the challenge
report, faculty members and
administrators are proceed-
ing with the preliminary
plans for a new library-learn-
ing center to fit the changing
patterns of teaching and
learning.

In a statement made early
this month, President D.
Grier Martin announced the
amount needed to meet the
challenge and said, ‘“‘We are
hopeful that our alumni and

‘friends will join efforts to

help us reach and exceed our
goal.”

A number of positions are
still open, according to Edi-
tor Sam Boyte, and the
purpose of the meeting is
to brief prospective staff-
ers.

There are openings for
reporters, copy readers and
sports writers.

Assuming that the sale is
made, Driesell said that he
plans to remodel thé build-
ing and reopen it as a ‘“‘col-
lege atmosphere" restaurant
featuring pizzas, fried chicken
and a special sandwich menu.

Driesell said that he plans
to ‘serve the best pizzas and
sandwiches in the South.” He
said that the menu may be
changed and expanded once
the restaurant begins opera-
tion.

He hopes to open his res-
taurant by the first home
football game on Sept. 30.

Renovation plans include
refinishing the floors. paint-
ing the interior, a probable
facelift for the front and pos-
sibly several other changes.

The coach said that he will
probably change the name
of the restaurant, (he men-
tioned ‘‘The Wildcat Den’ as
a possibility). and that he
may decorate it with David-
son sports pictures.

“I've been talking to a
couple of people about run-
ning thé restaurant,”’ Drie-
sell said. In addition to the
manager, Driesell said that
