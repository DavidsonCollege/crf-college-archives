DAVIDSON JUNIOR: ’
Poole Moves Up

In Pro League

DICK ROPER

When Coach Frank Packard
fields his Wildcat basebaliers in
the spring he'll be without the serv-
ices of one of the most promising
athletes in Davidson College, and
there won't be a thing he can do
about it.

Said athlete’s name is Dave
Poole, and the reason he won't ap-
pear on the Cat diamond is that
he's already playing baseball—for
a living.

Dave, a Winston-Salem na-
tive, attended Davidson for
three semesters before he signed
with Cincinnati of the National
League in the fall of 1948, Since
then he has spent ‘three sum-
mers playing for Columbia,
S. C., and Charleston. West,
Va., interspersing a little college
here and there in pursuit of a
B. S. degree in business.
it hasn’t been easy trying to mix

college with playing pro ball, Dave
will. be the first to admit. Now in
his junior year in scholastic stand-
ing, Dave plans to atténd both

semesters of school this year and ]|™
next until he gets his diploma, |’

playing only during the summer
months.

Not quite sure of himself yet as
a professional athlete, Dave is mak-
ing secondary plans in the way of a
proposed business career. He ad-
mits that sports is his first love,

however, and hopes to be called a

up to Tulsa in the Class AA Texas
League this summer.

During his three summers as a/@

pro, Dave has steadily improved
as a catcher and is working on his
hitting. His batting average has
fluctuated between .250 and .260
for two class A teams, Columbia
in the Sally and Charleston in the
Central.

Dave hasn't always played be-
hind the mask. When he plajed
for Reynolds High in Winston-
Salem, he was an infielder. It was
only when the team’s regular catch-
ers were injured that Dave stepped

in, doing such a good job that he
has stayed at that position ever
since, ‘

Although he is looking forward
to the coming baseball season, Dave
is at present enjoying his “rest’’ at
Davidson, living off campus with
his wife and sixteen months std
son.

Ex-Three Sport Star for Cats

W. & L. Brings
Hanlan, Crew
To Visit Cats

By JOHN HANDLEY

Hoping to even up their season’s
record at 2-2, the charges of Coach
Boyd Baird will entertain a strong
cage crew from ‘Washington and
Lee University. The varsity scrap
will get under way at the usual
8:15 on the Johnston Gym floor,
with a preliminary squad clash
scheduled for 6:30.

The Virginians are led by their
top scoring ace Jay Hanlan who
sparked the club last year, and has
a good start in the games in which
he has played this season. Some
' other names to watch on tonight's
‘program for the Generals are:
Hedge, Osborne, Rich (a sopho-
imere), Topp and Bean, Fresh from
;an easy 75-53 triumph on last Tues-
day over the Cavaliers of the Uni-
versity of Virginia, the Generals
are out to make it a repeat per-
formance of last year's two wins
over the Davidsonians.

Captain Bill Brooke, although
twisting his ankle in last week's
Furman encounter, is expected
to lead the Wildcats’ scoring
attack as usual from his forward
position, Forward Al Fitz-
gerald, center, Joe Dudley, and
guards Mac McLean, and either
Don Lazenby or Jerry King will
probably round out the list of
starters for the Wildcats.

Atter dropping their last two
starts to powerful N. C. State, 74-48,
and to a surprising Hurricane squad
frbm Furman University, 82-66, the
Cats would like to make the fa-
vored Generals their first confer-
ence victory of the current cam-
paign. The lone Red and Black vic-
tory was a thrilling 65-62 win over
Catawba.

After tonight’s battle the Wild-
cats will face the strong Blue Devil
squad of Duke at Durham on Tues-
day. After this encounter the cagers
will be idle until after Christmas,

Sigma Chis Team |WILDCAT OF THE WEEK - ---- Vail

To Capture Meet

By WALLACE ABBOTT

For the second straight year the Sigma Chis “‘swam off’
first in the intramural swimming meet. However, this year
it wasn’t done in the same manner as it was last year, because
their victory last year was a one-man affair, while this time

it was a team win. Two of the
Sigma Chi's three first places came
in the two-team swimming events,
the 150-yard relay and the 200-
yard relay. The third of their first
places was won by Montgomery in
the breast stroke.

In second place, and close on the
heels of the victorious Sigma Chis,
were the Kappa Sigs. Going into
the last event of the meet, the 200-
yard relay, the Kappa Sigs were
leading, but a first place by the
Sigma Chis turned the tide, and
they gained a hard carned victory.

In the third and fourth places
came the SAE's and KA's, with 12
and If points respectively. It was
in the last event of the night that
the relative positions of these two
teams also was decided, the SAE’s
winning a third place spot in the
relay.

The high point man and individ-
ual star of the meet was Charles
Haigh of the Pi Kapps. Winning
both the 50 and 75 yd. freestyle
events he was able to gain 10 points
and thereby become the high scorer.

By BILL BRADFORD

In our choice for the Wildcat of
the Week, we turn in this issue to
the gym and pick him from one of
the indoor sports. The sport is
wrestling and the boy is Morley
Vail.

Morley is no newcomer to the
mats. He won a letter ‘last year and
seems to be heading for a bigger
and better year as one of the more
experienced members of the squad.
Last week in a match with the
grapplers from Chapel Hill, the
Wildcats lost by 32-15, but Mor-
ley came through and won a close
and hardiought match, 8-7, from
one of the best wrestlers in the
state in the tough 147 Ib. class.

Morley hails from Virginia and
from a little town, Rosedale, stuck
up on the side of the Blue Ridge
Mountains. He started his wrestling
in high school at Augusta Military
Academy and in the state inter-
scholastic meet he was runner-up
in the 137 Ib. class. But Morley
moved on down from Virginia and
enrolled in Davidson.

During his freshman year he
didn’t have too much luck and it
was not until the second semester

Jof his sophomore year (ineligible | .
for the first semester) that he real-|-:
ly found himself and became the |‘

adept grappler for Coach Parker
that he is this year.

Morley is a member of the Kappa
Alpha Order and is also in the D
Club. He rooms down at Mrs.
Hamilton’s and at present is taking
pre-med work. Morley has really
started off the wrestling season
with a bang and if he keeps it up
will do much.toward a vastly ime

proved schedule for the Wildcats. |’

This nimble-minded nutcracker almost
tumbled for those tricky cigarette mildness tests.
But he worked himself out of a tight spot when
he suddenly realized that cigarette mildness

just can’t be judged by a mere puff or one single
sniff. Smokers everywhere have reached this
conclusion—there’s just one real way to prove the
flavor and mildness of a cigarette.

It’s the sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try
Camels as your steady smoke—on a pack-after-pack,
day-after-day basis. No snap judgments. Once
you've enjoyed Camels for 30 days in your
“T.Zone” (T for Throat, T for Taste),

you'll see why...
