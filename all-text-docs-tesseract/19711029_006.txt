DELT REIGN ENDS

Sigs Topple Delts
For IMAC Title

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

The Delts lost their third game
in the last five years last Mon-
day, and it was a big one.

The Sigs ended the Delts quest
for their sixth title in as many
seasons with an exciting 26-20
triumph.

Wet and muddy playing con-
ditions had the field looking like
the Dismal Swamp, and the ad-
verse weather had a noticeable
effect on the play of both
squads.

Lanky Frank Clark tallied
twice for the victors, once on
a pass from Bobby Kelly who
had fielded a punt. John John-
ston and Grey Smith added the
other Sig scores.

The Sigs relied heavily on
their strong defense, which had
carried them most of the sea-
son. Kelly, Randy Webster and
Cooper Geraty were standouts
as they kept pressure on Delt
tailback Bick Halligan all after-
noon.

Drew White. David Mast and
leaping Jim Brown were the
touchdown makers for the Delts,

success with
consequent

who had much
short passes and
flicks.

The game was a nip and tuck
affair, with each side threaten-
ing throughout the afternoon.
The Delts, for example, had one
touchdown called back because
of an offside penalty and had
another drive end on the Sig
one-yard line. -

The loss of Mitch Purvis with

a tendon injury crippled the
Delt attack for much of the
game.

Leading the Delt defense were
end Greg McCall. lineman David
Mast and backs Hugh Gaither
and Jim Wright.

The Davidson soccer team

Booters Roll Over St. Andrews

The booters defeated St. An-
drews 3-0 in a game that mark-
ed their gradual return to full
strength after losing several
key players to injuries.

This was the first defeat of
the St. Andrews team _ since
1965. Over the last six years,

Davidson has either lost or

Kittens Defeat Deacs 14-13

By SCOTT McMICHAEL
Staff Writer

Coach Stevens was pleased,
student-coach Jeff Lynn was
pleased, forty-odd freshman
football players were pleased.

Everyone was pleased except
for a handful of Wake Forest
fans clutching umbrellas as the
Davidson Wildkittens defeated
the Baby Deacs, 14-13, last Mon-
day in the rain on Richardson
Field.

Two interceptions thrown by
Davidson in the first quarter
stirred cries of ‘‘Here we go
again,” from the sparse home
team crowd. However, the 'Kit-
tens buckled down to solid foot-
ball after that and_ sent. the
Baby Deacs back to Winston-
Salem with another loss.

The victory set the freshman
record at 2-2. Whether or not
the Wildkittens have a winning
season will be settled on Nov.
5 when they meet The Citadel.

A first-quarter score by Wake
was neutralized in the second
by a Davidson touchdown.
Bruce Baker, subbing for reg-
ular frosh quarterback, David
Harper, passed the team to the
three yard Jine and then sent
Feney Mullins in for the score.

End Gary Pomeroy caught
three passes in the 60 yard
drive but it was Lin Potts who
set up th plunge by Mullins with
a 25 yard catch on a third down
and long yardage situation.

The Davidson defense held
off the Baby Deacs and the
score remained 7-7 until late in
the third period when the Wake
Forest quarterback pushed over
from the one yard line. A bad
snap foiled the extra point at-
tempt.

Even though ‘all three fresh-
man quarterbacks saw action
in the game (each throwing an

interception) it was Baker again
who carried the team to its sec-
ond score. His 12 yard pass to
Pomeroy in the fourth tied the
game. The conversion attempt
made it 14-13.

Interceptions by George Wiec-
ker and Tom Fleisher in the last
minutes of the game prevented
the Wake team from mounting
a threat to Davidson's lead.

Student defensive coach, Jeff
Lynn, praised the team effort
and excellent hitting of the ’Kit-
ten defense, which forced four

turnovers. He was quick to
point out, however that their
play marked no _ significant
change.

WHEN IN DOUBT 3

Lynn maintained that the de-
fense has usually played well
and had been responsible for
keeping the ‘Kittens in several
previous games.

The slippery condition of the
field caused the Davidson team
to go to the air, where they
found reasonable success. Alert
receivers often made the quar-
terbacks look good. Jim Schoon-
over made an_ exceptionally
good diving catch, pulling the
ball out of the mud on one play.

The ’Kittens’ performance was
especially good in the light of
the fact that the Wake Forest
team averaged about 20 pounds
heavier on both lines.

Freshman gridder Gordo Watson punts to Wake Forest.

tied, including a 1-1 tie last year.

Seraphin Gbari saw his first
action in several weeks against
St. Andrews, and returned in
good form, scoring one of the
‘Cats’ three goals.

Gbari had been sidelined due
to a leg injury in the Furman
match two weeks ago.

‘‘We played Gbari sparingly,”
said soccer coach Harry Fogle-
man, ‘“‘because of his leg. He
played about one half of the
game, and after a three week
layoff, he has gotten out shape.”

Dick Spinner scored the other
two Wildcat goals. Spinner is
leading scorer for the booters,
and Tuesday’s action raised his
total to 11 goals thus far for
the team.

The first goal of the game,
according to Fogleman, was
actually scored by a St. An-
drews defender. While trying to
kick the ball out of the goal
area, he accidentally put it
straight into the corner of the
goal, scoring for the Wildcats.

Spinner got credit for the

point, being the last attacker
to touch the ball.

The other injured  booters
were checked by the doctors
and trainers yesterday. Johnny

Robison is expected to return
to play tomorrow, but goalie
Charlie Heiner may be out for
another week.

Tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. the

Wildcats tackle the  booters
from East Carolina.
The ECU team _ presently

leads the north half of the con-
ference, and will likely be the
team Davidson will face in the
conference finals.

‘‘ECU has strong team,” Fog-
leman said, ‘“‘and we expect
quite a contest. Soccer is a big
time sport to them.”

The East Carolina team tied
NC State, a team that defeated
UNC, 2-0, a team that is usual-
ly a national power though re-
mains unranked this year.

ECU edged out St. Andrews
1-0 several weeks ago, but sev-
eral of the St. Andrews’ play-
ers predicted a Davidson vic-
tory.

St. Andrews dominated the
offense in their match with
ECU, but were unable to con-
nect for a score.

After playing ECU, the David-

son booters will host NC State.
The State game will be at 3
p.m. next Tuesday.

injuries Slow Cats
As Season Closes

A plethora of injuries have
reduced Davidson's chances of
a high finish in the Southern
Conference cross-country cham-
pionships to nearly zero.

Those same injuries were a
major problem in last Tues-
day's meet here at Davidson,
when the ’Cats took on Appala-

chian State, Furman, Pem-
broke, High Point and Wake
Forest. Davidson finished last

in the six-team contest, mainly
due to physical problems.
“We had a good chance of
beating High Point and Wake
Forest Tuesday, but Joe Shibley
had a pulled groin muscle, Paul
Mitchell had a knee’ problem,
and Howard Boyd was hurting
from the leg problem he has
had all year,” said Martin.
These three runners are nor-
mally the second, third, and
fifth finishers for the Wildcats.
