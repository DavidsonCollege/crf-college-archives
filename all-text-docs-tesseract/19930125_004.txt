THE DAVIDSONIAN. ELECTION '93 MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 1993 _

1993 SGA ELECTIONS

SGA PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

Editor's Note: The Davidsonian asked the candidates for Student Government President to respond
to four questions regarding their candidacy.
(1) What are your qualifications for the job of SGA President?
(2) If elected, what will be your primary interests/goals as SGA President?
(3) The SGA President is the leader, but still part of a team. If you are elected, how do you
plan to pursue your own personal agenda as well as work with the SGA body as a whole to get

things done?

(4) Why do you want to be SGA President?

Jennifer
Humphrey

Initiative, action, experience,
commitment, and dedication to
students and their needs are just a
few of the qualities an effective
SGA president should possess. I
can offer these to Davidson. Three
years on the Senate, two years as
class president, involvement in
various Campus groups, as well as
work with several SGA commit-
tees qualify me for this position.

I have experience in many as-
pects of student life. Within the
Union, I have worked with the F-

“Crew and Davidson Outdoors. I

have participated in IMAC and
was a member of the Track team. I
helped to start Student Health Op-
tions and Concerns (SHOC) which

- has functioned as aliaison between

students and the infirmary and will
be setting up a hot-line this semes-
ter. [helped initiate Connor House
to increase women’s choices and
representation on the court, a goal
not yet achieved. I also have intro;
duced visitors to the campus as a
tour guide with Davidson Ambas-
sadors. My past involvement with
these groups has given me an in-
formed view of activity at Davidson
and of student concerns.
Committee work is nothing
new tome. I have worked with the
Activity Tax Council to reorga-
nize the way your $130 activity tax
is divided between campus groups.
As a result, student groups may
now petition formoney atany time,
not just in April. Recipients are
also held accountable during the
year for their expenditures, some-
thing not previously done. Asa
member of the Student Conduct
Council this year, sexual harass-
ment and assault have been my
major concern. I am helping to

establish a system that deals spe-

cifically with these sensitive cases
on a separate sub-committee..

Asa co-chair of the Council
on Academic Affairs, I have
worked on the calendar and am
pleased to tell you that, beginning
this semester, students will have
eleven periods instead of ten to
take their exams. This committee
is also looking into reducing cum
laude graduation requirements in
response to minus grades, improv-
ing drop/add, evaluating optional
class days, and getting student rep-
resentation on the calendar sub-
committee of the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee. With this work, I
have learned the various avenues
through which changes may be
instituted. I have worked hard for
students the past three years and
hope to continue doing so as your
SGA President.

Some of my primary goals as
SGA President are to increase co-
operation and efforts between vari-
ous student groups, improve the
effectiveness of SGA Committees,
and continue successful projects
that the SGA has already initiated.

In the past, there has been little
coordination and communication
between the Union, PCC, andSGA.
Though each of these groups have
different roles on campus, in-
creased interaction between these
will better serve the student body.

the campus. Perhaps a coordi-
nated effort between these three
groups could have effected a
slightly different outcome and
mighthave made the transition toa
new policy easier. This was a
lesson we all learned the hard way.
Let’s work to prevent this from
happening again. The only way to
get student concerns heard and re-
ally do something about them is to
organize effectively and work to-
gether.

I feel that the SGA has not
fully utilized the greatest resource
on campus; the students. SGA
Committees have not consistently
met their potential to work for stu-
dents. It is my hope to involve
more students in these groups and
work with the chairs. Reach Out
At Davidson has shown that sev-
eral committees under one um-
brella can all be effective if prop-
erly organized. I would like to
reorganize the way committees

have worked within the SGA and.

have Chairs meet collectively.
More focus among SGA Commit-
tees will not only get more accom-
plished, but also involve students
in a position where they can make
a difference in Davidson. A more
effective SGA is my major goal.

This year the SGA has worked

to “rebuild community” through
increased contact between students
and other parts of the college.. I
hope to continue Student/Faculty
Roundtables and invite adminis-
trators and other faculty to SGA
meetings to further relations and
communication between all
“Davialsonians.” The Committee
on Minority Affairs has worked
hard this year to promote discus-
sion surrounding race, gender, and
religion in freshman halls. This
has met with success. Aspresident
I will encourage these discussions
to include all students, not just
freshmen. I also wish to push for
curriculum dealing with cultures
outside of Europe and America.
There are, forexample, weaknesses
in Latin American and Afro-
American Studies. A greater vari-
ety of courses should be provided
to enrich the academic experience
of students.

I feel I have much to offer the
student body as the SGA presi-
dent. Iam sensitive to the needs of
the students and have worked hard
for the past three years to have
their concerns heard and acted
upon. Since coming to Davidson I
have been involved in various

1. Ihaven’t always wanted to be
President of the SGA. Asa Fresh-
man, I was frustrated with student
government. There seemed to be a
limit on what we could do. Sure
we could hand out exams and talk
about lighting and kiosks, but I
never felt like the SGA could ever
really make a difference — until

~ last year. The long overdue emer-

genceofF.L.A.G.as an SGA-char-
tered organization functioned as a
signal to me that we as Davidson
students were beginning to open
our minds.

I believe in a new vision for
the SGA — a campaign platform

’ based entirely on inclusiveness,

diversity, and open-mindedness. I
offer two qualifications for the job
of SGA President: the passion to
make Davidson appeal to every-
one rather than a certain type of
person, and a plar to get us headed
in that direction.

2. It has been said that a commu-
nity is only as strong as its weakest
link. I often think of organizations
in these terms — especially in re-
gard to an athletic team or even a
team of SGA Senators. What about
Davidson College? There is acer-
tain part of Davidson that I believe
is particularly weak. It is the issue
of diversity.

Because of our lack of diver-
sity anda general discontentamong
minorities at Davidson, minority
concems are my priority as a can-
didate for SGA President. If there
is one positive message I wish to

_ get across to other students, it is

that a strong effort to diversify the
faces on this campus as well as the
curriculum would be a benefit for
everyone in the community, not
just minorities.

My intent is not to criticize
Davidson’s past, but to assert my
conviction that we have arrived at
a time when some headway can be
gained. After talking with many
Freshmen during CoMA discus-
sions about race relations, I am
convinced that a lot of students are
frustrated with Davidson’s lack of
diversity. Having fulfilled his last
year’s campaign platform of Com-
munity Building, Anthony Foxx
has paved the bridge of communi-
cation between the trustees and a
SGA President who concentrates
on diversity. The trustees are more
receptive now to the students’ con-
cerns than they were a year ago.
They need to hear that the students
want diversity. I know I caneffec-
tively deliver that message.

To the trustees, I plan to em-
phasize the need for more support
towards financial aid and minority
scholarships. I plan also to follow
through on Anthony’s efforts to
convince them of the need for a
new student union. I believe

Davidson desperately needs an al-
ternative social outlet — a place
where we can all hang out when
court parties start getting a little bit
old. Tothe faculty, I plan to pursue
the addition of an integrated stud-
ies curriculum — something along
the line of humanities, but linking
ethnic, gender, and international
studies. To the students, I plan to
focus on aredirection of attitude as
it relates to open-mindedness and
unfair stereotypes. This last chal-
lenging goal does not involve a
process of actively seeking to con-
vert opinions to the “right” view.
Rather it involves opendiscussions
about race relations, both in and
out of the classroom. I would like
to see the model upon which
S.E.A.R.C.H. was founded intro-
duced into the eating houses and
fraternities.

I do not believe that defining
minority concerns as the priority
translates into a neglect of other
important issues. If I am elected,
the SGA will still challenge the
existing alcohol policy signifi-
cantly. We will still strengthen
efforts to offer alternatives to this
backhanded business of optional
class days and 5 exam days. In

fact, these kinds of issues will be |
pursued no matter whom youelect.
I believe it is the issue of diversity
that is the key factor in this elec-
tion. Diversifying Davidson and
redirecting attitudes are not over-
night processes, but they are con-
cerns that must be pursued with
more energy and dedication.

3. The Davidsonian is wise to
ask this question. In the past three
years, I have often noticed that the
President’s personal agenda can
be quite different from the SGA
agenda which is defined often by
the immediate concerns of ‘the
Senators. I realize that, if elected,
I may be challenged with this task
of both pursuing my own priorities
(as they are detailed in the previ-
Ous answer) and responding to the
various other concerns of the Sena-
tors. :

If I am elected, the SGA
agenda will be formed largely ac-
cording to what the senators want,
even if I am not personally inter-
ested in some of their concerns. In
