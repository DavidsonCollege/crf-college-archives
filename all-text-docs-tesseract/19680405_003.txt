By RICK MILDNER

Tt is difficult to look back
now and determine the basis
on which I decided not to en-
ter he advanced ROTC pro-
gram in my junior year at
Davidson. I'm tempted to dis:
miss the entire question by
replying “it seemed like the
thing to do at the time”.

Nor would this be inaceuw-
rate, except by omission. for
it describes exactly how I
approached the question.

As little as I may have re-
alized it at the Ume, how-
ever, many considerations—
some significant, others triv-
inl—ontcred into my (inal de-
clsion.

I did not refuge to enter,
the program because of the
‘morality question involved in
our position in Vietnam. But
I must admit that our posi-
tion in Vietnam seems more
immoral daily as the possi-

bility of my participation in.

it becomes more immediate.

In fact. J don’t believe I
even allowed the possibility
thut I might be forced to
serve in Vietnam enter into
my decision one way or the
other.

The Tower Test?

It provided little more than
a vivid backdrop, impressing
me with the importance of
my decision.

My Initial objections con-
sisted of such apparently
trivial things as my natural
aversion to marching. talcdng
orders and jiving “hy the
tumbers."’

But most of all, I found
myself overwhelmed by the
monument] wasle of time it
all seemed to be. The mast
attractive aspect was the
60 dollars a tmorth, every
month for two whale years.

In the end I decided thut
although I may have wasted
my time for money in the
past and would no doubt do
sn in the future. the waste of
time the Army sepresented
wos worth decidedly more
than 50 dollarz cuch month.

Such reasons seem trivisl
even Lo me. In the end, my
decision rupresented deeper
thoughts and feelings.

f Found that [ objveled to
the very concept of tha citl-
yens army raised by con-
seription. 1 resented wastlng
two very important yeltrs,
not in the service of my
country, but in the service of
an organization whose way
of life I despised.

I do not mean to shrink
{ram my responsibilities to
ty country or my fellow

man, Nor do I expect this
obligation to consist af tut
two years service in the
armed forces.

I intend to serve my cout
try for the rest of my life
but have no desire to do £0

moth United State, Army.

In the end I chase the ‘se.

curity of freedom and uncer-
tainty over that of comsnit-
ment to an organization and
cause I found opposed to my
own way of life. ;

behalf of a compulsory ROTC
program with credit tor both

Outiaw snid he was not
permmaily inflexible alsout
changes in the program, but
that be felt that a good ROTO
program at Davidson te pos-
ftble only if it remains com-
plibsary.

On the question of academ-
Ie credit. Outiaw snid, “The
military acience pragram of-
fers on sicil whioh can be rel-
evant lo a person's ilfe, and
therefore. thosgh not part of

academic credit and should
remain 9 compulsory port of
the curriculum.”

Qutlaw cited learning to
speak on their feet and ac:
ceptance of responsthility
through lendership as the
LUsings students could Jearn in
the ROTC program.

“Many Davidson graduates
have written me in the past
saying they had benefited
from their completion of
‘the ROTC program and were
glad they had had the oppor:
tunity to be in it,” Outlaw
sald.

Regarding the course ma-
terial, Outlaw sald that as
Professor of Military Science
he has the frecdom to change
25 per cent of the course con-
tent prescribed by the Army.

Outlaw outlined centative
plang for the ROTC program
under the new curriculum.
The basic course would de
one hour per week for five
of the student's first six
terms. Completion of the en
tire basic course would carn
the student academic credit
for one course.

the Blue Sky proposal. Pat-
terson sald he fecis no col-

Patterson snid that military

Puckett expressed strong
