Students support Ada Jenkins program for Latinas |

Katie VOEGTLI
Staff Writer

In response to the difficulties fac-
ing the community’s Latina women,
the Ada Jenkins Latino Development
Services is making an effort to meet
the need for services with their Lati-
na Empowerment, Achievement and
Development Program (L.E.A.D.).

“Whether a family has to face ill-
ness, job loss, or other life situations,
we know that all people have the abil-
ity to improve their
lives, and we are
here to help them
do so,” the center’s
website states.

One of the more
recent initiatives
targets one of the
most underserved
groups in David-
son and at large, Latina women.
Latinos and Hispanics are the most
underrepresented minority in the na-
tional workforce, and Latina women
often must clear the hurdles of gen-
der and racial biases to land a spot in
the work force.

Targeted at Latina women across
the North Mecklenburg area, this
program strives to equip its partici-
pants with the skills and confidence
necessary for participation and suc-
cess in the job search. Besides pro-
viding resources for professional
training, L.E.A.D. gives clients the
necessary tools to conquer their job
interview.

“We are very excited for a
great year, and continue to
take new volunteers.”

-L.E.A.D. President
Marianne Daniels ’12

One of the first steps for clients
participating in the program is ac-
quiring appropriate clothing for the
job search.

All participants are encouraged to
browse Ada Jenkins’ closets, which
are lined with professional business
attire donated by sponsors and com-
munity members. Women are free
try on clothes until they decide on
two power suits for interviews and

job-seeking.

"12 said that de-
spite the vandalism
and destruction of
L.E.A.D.’s closets
over the summer,

they have since
made positive prog-
ress.

“We were lucky enough to re-
ceive the Sunshine Lady Grant,
which will allow us to make signifi-
cant improvements to the program,”
Daniels said. “It came as a real bless-
ing after the vandalism, because we
had to purchase a lot of things over
again. This time around, our closets
are indestructible!”

After deciding on their business
outfits, volunteers help women cre-
ate and polish their resumes and give
them tips for presenting themselves
and their experiences in the most ad-
vantageous light before the day of
their job interview.

sometimes-stressful event by partici-
pating in mock interviews followed
by debriefings with feedback and
suggestions for improvement. The
English skills of clients vary, but all
are encouraged to bolster their pro-
ficiency by registering for free Eng-
lish classes.

All programs at the Ada Jenkins
Center welcome volunteers, and
L.E.A.D. especially needs those with
Spanish language skills. Volunteers
may choose to assist in any branch of
the program — fashion, resume, job
interview or general client services.
L.E.A.D. also accepts donations of
gently used professional clothing.
The organization’s special events
throughout the year include holiday

fundraisers around Thanksgiving,
Christmas, Easter and Mother’s Day
as well as the Annual Gala.

Over the course of the summer,
Ada Jenkins compiled a list of over
100 women interested in taking part
in L.E.A.D.

“[We have] plenty of catching up
to do!” Daniels said. “We are very
excited for a great year, and continue
to take new volunteers. If anyone
is interested in learning more about
the program, we meet every other
Thursday at 9:00 pm, and we volun-
teer every Saturday from 1-3. Any-
one is welcome, even if they only
want to give it a try, they can e-mail
madaniels or kafahy for more infor-
mation.”

Tomorrow, Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, a schol-
ar specializing in Middle Eastern cultural
and political development, will visit David-
son to address the campus on her work and
experiences.

“One Woman’s Sto-
ry of Captivity in Iran”

Lives: Women and Iran’s Islamic Revolu-

Esfiandiari served as the Deputy Secre-
tary General of the Women’s Organization of
Iran and has also worked at Princeton Uni-
versity, where she served as a professor of
Persian language and literature, and is the re-
cipient of a MacArthur
Foundation Grant.

Esfiandiari claims
that during subsequent

pressured into making
a false confession of anti-government activi-
ties, a confession which she later withdrew.
She was released after 110 days of solitary
confinement in Evin Prison.

Esfiandiari is the Director of the Middle
East Program at the Woodrow Wilson Inter-
national Center for Scholars in Washington,
D.C., where she received that position after
serving as a fellow from 1995-1996.

Woodrow Wilson Cen-
ter last summer.

“I think this is a
really special oppor-
tunity for students because Haleh’s story is
so unique,” Van Hollen said. “Her story of
being imprisoned in her home country is as
informative as it is moving. Every time you
turn on the news these days there are people
talking about Iran, but it is really rare that
you hear from someone that has actually
grown up there or actually been imprisoned
there and Haleh has done both.”

The lecture will take place in the C. Shaw
Smith 900 room at 5:30 p.m. and is free and
open to the public.
