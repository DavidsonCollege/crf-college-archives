A so-called Waking Life

By Derek Lou
Arts and Living Editor

It’s that time again, boys and girls. Paper
after take home after paper afterexam. And
then the lucky ones have more on top of that:
baseball practice, laying out The Davidsonian,
work-study, tanning at the Lake. So, fellow
crammers and self-scheduling examinees, I
have for you a suggestion. When the going
gets tough, and you don’t get going, in what
useless activity will you partake? Don’t
reach for your roommate’s PS2 controller.
Don’t select Donkey Kong for another match
of Mario Tennis. And stay away from the
spiced rum.

“But Derek, if I can’t do those things, what
can I do when my poor, overworked body
succumbs to procrastination?”

Well, I'll tell you, and of course, it’s watch-
ing a movie. Get your hands on this quaint,

wonders how she feels younger and more

alive everyday even though the passage of ‘

time only brings her closer to death. Remem-
ber though, with philosophy and movies like

2001: A Space Odyssey and Mulholland Drive, _

enjoyment and appreciation do not necessi-
tate comprehension. =

In terms of thought provocation, Waking
Life has as much as possible, which is pre-
cisely why it makes the perfect study break
movie. There’s little plot anid much meander-
ing, not only between characters, but also
between reality and the dream world. You
don’t have to worry about what’s on the
bottom of a coffee mug, why Tyler Durden
only talks to Edward Norton, and how
Leonard’s wife dies. No, no, Waking Life is

not some cheap gimmick of film that clings to °

silly details and plot reversals like they’re.

little film called Waking Life. It hits Block-
buster on Tuesday. Richard Linklater wrote
and directed Waking Life, and he’s also the
guy responsible for Dazed and Confused.

“Oh my god, I LOVE Dazed and Con-
fused!”

Yeah, that’s right. I know you love Dazed
and Confused, and you'll love Waking Life
more. Wiley Wiggins — that’s Mitch Kramer
— leads us through a series of interlocking
stories and ideas, somé that blow our minds,
some that make us laugh, and some that go
right over our heads. ;

“Dude, this organic chemistry stuff is fly-
ing over my dome as we speak. I don’t think
Ican handle any more academic who-na-na.”

Don’t fret, little one. Indeed, Waking Life
is the stuff of philosophy. and intellectual
mumbo-jumbo. For example, one character

The Usual Suspects is the best movie ever

You’regwrong. Very, very wrong. But
back to &,
break. Of course, attention must be paid, but
each scene stands, to some degree, on its own.

You could very well close up The Heart of
Midlothian, turn off your brain, press play ory
the VCR, and then head back to Sir Scott after
fifteen or twenty minutes of the Linklater
film. —

Also, Waking Life looks like no other movie
you’ve seen. It’s been animated using a
technique called rotoscoping.

“Hold on, Buck-O. I don’t have time for
“Under the Sea.’”

Trust me on this one: there are no talking
crabs. Linklater filmed the movie using hand-
held cameras and then, using computers, he
and his team animated the footage. The effect
is hard to describe, but if a dream could be put
on film, it would resemble the images in
Waking Life.

Also, Linklater’s Tape was recently re-
leased on video. Unlike with Life, plot drives
that movie: it is all about what happened and
who knows what happened during a high
school party. I highly recommend that film,
but not for this coming week. Stick with
Waking Life: it’s a refreshing, challenging
film that provides relief without insult. Wak-
ing Life could also provide hours of contem-
plation, but if your week is as busy as your
peers’, just pop it in, sit back, and enjoy.
