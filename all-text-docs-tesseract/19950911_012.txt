Faculty exhibition mystifies viewers

By Laura BENoIT
Staff Writer

In search of amyth big enough
to do an ongoing series, Herb Jack-
son stumbled upon St. Veronica,
who wiped Jesus’ brow with her
veil. This resulted in 118 works,
the most recent of which are dis-
played.

They were made using many
layers of acrylic — between 15
and 100 to be exact. They are all
the same size and refer to the veil in
the same way: usually with a rect-
angle which comes down from the
top.

This suggests the veil to be
suspended in space, so his works
tend to focus more on the mysti-
cism of the myth rather than the
actual literal image, i.e., look
closely! It’s amagic image! Each
painting has its own rationale with
color, not relative to some sym-
bolic else.-

When questioned about when
he worked on his pieces, Jackson
chuckled and stated that it de-
pended on how one defines “spare
time” (by now, even the freshmen
know all too much about that topic
at Davidson).

There are two sets of prints in
Glenn Ligon’s exhibit. The first,
titled “Runaways,” is 10 litho-

graphs in the format of slave fly-
ers. Ligon had his friends write the
descriptions of himself that appear
on the flyers.

The second set, “Narratives,”
is an ensemble of nine etchings
with chine collé and refers to con-
temporary experiences of escaped
slaves and refugees from the law
using the fonts and language of the
19th century.

His exhibition is very per-
sonal; it reveals a lot about himself
and handles issues of diverse real-
ity. He is an individual who must
deal with racial passage — the
identity and freedom found in his
African-American heritage. Al-
though he did not experience it,
this past is a part of him, and he
struggles with it.

The title of his exhibition, “To
Disembark,” does not necessarily
have reference in itself; it most
probably originated from the idea
of the Virginia slave Henry “Box”
Brown, who escaped and shipped
himself to freedom in 1849.

Eight wood and mixed media
boxes fill the room and contribute
to the atmosphere of disembark-
ing. Ligon creates a legend about

himself in this series of runaways
and narratives.

of barrels hanging from a ceiling”

that expose descending ladders
when a person enters the display
room, triggering a complex con-
cealed mechanism and initiating a
series of movements.

When the ladders are fully

extended, an immense amount of
time seems to elapse before they
ascend back to their origin. It may
surprise you, but it is actually only
20 seconds! In order for the move-
ment to make sense, it is necessary
for it to be contrasted by the totally

static. When the ladders come
down and stop, you’are waiting for
movement but just not getting it.
During this period of time phe are
frozen.

The mental experience defi-
nitely exceeds 20 seconds, espe-
cially if you are waiting for some-
thing to go wrong. When they are
static, you take the time to look at
them and realize that they are lad-
ders.

Barrels are utilitarian refer-
ences which give entrance into a
new context, a new environment.
What is offered by the peace is an
opportunity for escape, but when
they close (clamp shut) they can be
a prison or a trap. The barrels are
human scale — you can almost
imagine fitting inside of it.

This exhibit is about breaking
physical barriers, driven by the psy-
chological, the mental.

The table with a hole in it is an
example of this theme: a ladder
goes through it. Transition is im-
portant, whether froma physical to
a spiritual experience or being ina
place and transcending it to an-
other.

You do not have to under-
stand it or know it in order for it to
appear significant. In this context
though, you don’t know what to do
with any of it: table, barrels, or
ladders, .

In search of a masterpiece

Students study art in England and France

By WILSON BunTIN
Staff Writer

_ Forthe spring semester of last
year, 13 Davidsoncollege students
and one faculty member traveled
to England taking the study of art
history to new-found heights.

This was the first trip to En-
gland that Davidson has offered to
those interested in the study of art
and architecture. Both art history
majors and non-majors participated
in the program receiving full credit
for the spring semester.

Dr, Larry Ligo, Chair of the
Art Deparment, helped to create
and structure the trip to England
and served as the sole faculty mem-
ber on the trip. Ligo designed the
entire program so*that students
could reap the benefits of studying
beautiful works of art on location.
“There are no slides. When we’re
studying a particular artist’s work,
we’ re standing in front of the artist’s
work,” he says.

Such a-program might recall
memories or perhaps dreams of
passing sunny spring days in a
small, cozy pub or browsing
through a side street art exhibit, the
rich, sweet taste of beer lingering
on the lips.

This program is not designed
for those that harbor such notions
amidst a busy junior year. The
students that traveled to Europe
were there to learn and see first-
hand some of the most beautiful
and intoxicating works of art in the
world.

This overwhelming desire to
learn and experience set the pace
for the program from the onset.

within the three courses.

Ligo describes the semester as “in-
tense.”

Three courses are taught dur-
ing the semester: Norman and
Gothic Architecture, 19th century
painting, and Survey of Artin Brit-
ain. The fourth course credit is an
independent study done at the end
of the semester based on the
student’s topic of choice.

tually serving as a lecturer and tour
guide to the group in the chosen
area of research.

The semester began in Lon-
don, where students spent two
weeks writing two of the required
papers. Numerous libraries were
in walking distance of the group’s
quarters in the Bloomesburg Dis-
trict. The work during this period
was critical to the success of the
rest of the semester.

Next, the group traveled to
France, spending three weeks in
the heart of Paris. Students fre-
quented the Louvre studying the
renown David.

The more modern Musée
d’ Orsay allowed the group to view
post-impressionist works as well
as masterpieces by. Paul Gaugin
and Vincent Van Gogh.

Paris also offered the group an
in-depth look at the birth of Gothic
architecture which was later trans-
ported to England. Chartre, Notre
Dame, and Saint Chapelle were
important in tracing the develop-
ment of Gothic architecture to En-
gland.

There was a general consen-

sus among the group that Mont
Saint Michelle, which sits majesti-
cally along the Norman coast was
a highlight of the semester. Ligo
agreed that “it offered a Ro-
manesque and Gothic summary of
the entire evolution of these styles.”
The group then returned to
England via the Chunnel under the
English Channel, an architectural
masterpiece in its ownright. From
Paris to London, it took a brisk
three hours as opposed to the five
hour ferry ride also available.
After two weeks of study in

London, the group proceeded on
its first road trip to Southern En-

gland visiting six cathedrals in two
weeks.

The second expedition was to
Northern England shortly after a
10 day stay back in London where
students worked on an indepen-
dent study of choice. The northern
trip lasted three weeks as the group
visited six more Gothic buildings.

. Thesemester winded toaclose
in London with as much intensity
as it had began. For two to three
weeks, students took final exams.
Ligo was very pleased at how the
semester progressed: “It went very
well. I would change very little.
The students worked very hard.”

Davidson is continuing to dif-
ferentiate itself from peers by pio-
neering such beneficial programs
abroad.

Ligo supports Davidson’s ef-
forts, adding, “I don’t know of any
place in the country that duplicates
this program to England. It isa
rare opportunity, and I hope more
and more people will take advan-
tage of it.”
