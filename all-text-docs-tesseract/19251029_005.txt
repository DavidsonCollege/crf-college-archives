The leaders of the Glee Club announce
that the tone quality and voices of the
jclub, this year are better than in’ pre-

vious years, there being an abundance of

} good material from which to choose.

The Mandolin and Guitar Club, an im-

portant feature of the club, has been in-

creased from three to five members and
are this year making a specialty of pop-
ular music.

Tootie Crayto and Count Davis are in
charge of the Jazz Orchestra which is
reputed to be better than that of last
year. This orchestra will make certain
that jazz music holds its place on the

programs,

Only one quartet will be used this year,
this quartet to D. G.
Wilson, M. M. Lockhart, R. S. Lowrence,
and D. M. Calhoun. Besides this quar-
tet will be a double quartet, composed of
these and four other members of the club

The Concert Orchestra will be under
the supervision of Tom Barr, who is well
fitted for this position by his former work
