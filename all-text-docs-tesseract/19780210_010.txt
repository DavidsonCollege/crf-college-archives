Eulogy ie

“That was the prettiest damn tree on campus.”
they said that day.

Oild?—Not so very; not as old as some men | know,
nor perhaps even displacing as much dirt at death.

Yet ending brings its eulogies
and slightly colored memories
and times we all recall.

How Strong and Silently it soared

Carrying our eyes upward toward the sky and beyond.

And in the evenings when its constant arms

Embraced the wandering moon and stars,

Its image touched the passerby for just that quiet second
looking so permanent.

It never had to say, ‘I’m here’
We never thought to say, ‘I know’

Drinking the rain and bearing the snow of seasons, the ice;
We were impressed with age and height
in retrospect.

And yet like weak and stunted roots,
how little lies beneath the surface.
