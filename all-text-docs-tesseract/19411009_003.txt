Mac Jeffries, Sophomore:

The peace plan of Woodrow Wil- |
son was a noble undertaking, based
on‘noble ideals. It might have work-
ed had all the nations of the world
co-operated. As it was, his own
country, the United States, run by)
an isolationist bloc in the Senate,
failed him in its support. One thing
seems certain—the new peace, if and

when it comes, must be so severe!
that Germany will never be able to}
lift a single finger again, or else it
must place her on an absolute parity |
with her erswhile enemies, with a
provision enforced, for preserving |
such a parity. The fault of 1919 was

not’in the plan, but in its en-
forcement. [think it can work
again evidently Churchill and

Roosevelt think so from the similar-
ity of their “Eight Points” to Wil-
son’s “Fourteen Points.”

Monroe Bush, Jr., Seliior: |
Woodrow — Wilson's Fourteen |
Points were:ja’ noble gesture to-|
ward that “Federation. of the],
World” which Tennyson spoke of;|
however, Mr. Wilson was playing |
the old game of walking the fence

this compromise was his undoing.

Let me explain: These Points, ideal-
istic as they may have seemed to the
“typical” American, were not true
idealism in a spiritual sense. Some-
failed tostrike that all im-

of the earth's hectic population are |

to be inspired. And on the other
hand, they were not realistic enough
to satisfy »the historical politician

who deals in'‘terms of which he can
see and write down in figufes.
In the faint hope, ever growing

dimmer, that our present statesmen

will sincerely attempt to remedy
these two gross mistakes, my
thought takes this course: Let |
the vernments of man devise |

a treaty which embodies power in
every profound sense of that word
