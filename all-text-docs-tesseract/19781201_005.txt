Letters To The Editor

‘Sell out’ too cheap?

To the Editor:

I have followed with interest
the WDAV affair in recent
issues of The Davidsonian. : I
feel that all your articles and

letters have neglected to judge -

Dr. Spencer and the Trustees’
actions in the light of pure
pragmatism. Consider for a
moment...

Surely the raising of funds
through contributions is a legi-
timate activity for any college
administration. The Admini-
stration was only using WDAV
to further this purpose. The
purpose was noble.

Safety poses problem for motorized bike

By STEVE AUSTIN
; PIRG Columnist
That peculiar hybrid of mo-
torcycle and bicycle, the motor-
ized bicycle, is literally sweep-
-ing the country off its feet.
Getting 100 to 200 miles to the
gallon, the bike is undoubtedly
one answer to the energy short-
age. As a second ‘“‘car’, the
motorized bike can be_used for
around-town errands and com-
muting to work.
Motorized bicycles are not
suitable for long-distance travel

or foul weather trips. Passen-

gers are strictly illegal. With’ a

one to two. horsepower, one-cy-

linder engine, they must run at
full throttle to break twenty or
thirty miles per hour. © -

In; Europe. after. World War
II, the motorized bicycle. be-
came popular very quickly.
Inexpensive and energy-saving,
the bikes today constitute a
third of France’s motorized
vehicles. Yet up until 1974, the

motorized bicycles could not be

sold in the United States ‘be-
cause it could not achieve the
standards required: of the mo-
torcycles with which they were
classed.

Four years ago, partially in
response to the energy crisis,
-the bikes were put under a clas-
sification of their own. Since

then, sales have rocketed; :

150,000 were sold ane

A more legitimate question
for consideration in The David-
sonian:is: Realizing that the
Administration ‘‘sold. out”’
WDAYV for money .. . Did they
sell too cheaply?

As in the old story of the lady
of easy virtue, we have already
established the nature of the act
in question. Now it is time to
quibble over the price. . .

Do you dare ask, just how
much did the Administration
get in gifts and pledges for the
action?

they would thereby be safer.
The most.frequent cause of
accidents, though, has been the
vehicle’s inability to keep, up

with city traffic:

Statés, such as North Catal.

mph make city driving in heavy

_traffic hazardous: other cars, ir-.

ritated by a slow bike blocking
the way, try to edge around the
bike, creating a potentially fatal
situation.

Particularly with drivers

weighing over 150 pounds, the
vehicle is slow to accelerate. at
traffic lights. Hills of any sort
strain the engine considerably;
pedaling helps some, but some-
times. the easiest solution is to
get off.and jog alongside.

To the Editor:

In a recent edition of The
Davidsonian there appeared an
article entitled ‘‘Nestle Corpo-
ration Under Fire For Third
World Marketing” written, by
Steve Austin. Unfortunately,
the author never contacted Ne-
stle for its position and the
article..contains an inaccurate
portrayal of the Nestle policy on
infant feeding in developing
countries.

As a manufacturer, Nestle
recognizes its responsibility to
educate mothers on the proper
use of formula products and to
encourage mothers to continue
breast feeding as long as pos-

- sible, even when supplementa-

tion is necessary.

Nestle educational programs
begin with the product labels
themselves which contain de-
tailed written instructions on
the use of the product together
with step-by-step illustrations.

Nestle medical representa-
tives work closely with local go-
vernment health authorities to

the driver’s anatomy but can
easily cause a bike to overturn,
Unlike many states, New Jer-
sey not only requires a driver’s
license but also registration and
insurance. ‘‘Moped-ed’’ is now

available in many of the state's—

junior high schools.

The bikes dump more hydro-'
carbons into the air than many
cars. As:with motorcycles,. the
Environmental Protection Ag-
ency has been more. lenient on
the bike emission because they
are so few in number.

Traction is generally not

good—one more reason why .

driving in rough weather is not
recommended... :

Motorized bicycles are equip-
ped with buzzers. (not horns)
and the noise produced is
inadequate for defensive dri-
ving. The volume of the buzzer
and, the brilliance of the head-
light are: affected by how fast
the motor is running since a

All of those interbeted in im-

Creativity silenced

To the Editor:

It was with disbelief that I
learned of the actions of the
Davidson College Board of
Trustees to silence the creative
voices of Davidson students

associated with radio station
WDAV.

Obviously, the Trustees.

bowed to economic pressures

of a battery. Both horns and
signal lights are recommended
additions.

New Jersey is taking the

initiative in requiring more:

stringent ‘safety measures ‘for
the bikes and their: drivers.

The bikes cost between $300
and $700. More information on
different models can be ob-
tained by writing the Moped
Association of America (1001
Connecticut Ave. NW; Wash-
ington, D.C. 20036), a ‘manu-
facturers’ group, or by consul-
ting Consumer Reports (June
1978). Don’t be in any hurry to
drive off though; manufacturers
recommend breaking in a bike
