Dispatch plays The Ritz in Raleigh last weekend

By MICHAEL GALDO
Special Contributor

Dispatch played at The Ritz Theater in
Raleigh on November 10th to a packed house
exceeding two thousand people. The band
has been playing together at schools across
the Northeast since they formed at Middlebury
College in 1995. A college favorite for a long
time, the band has recently been gaining
more popularity across the nation.

If you are one of the few who have never
heard a Dispatch song (or have only heard
“The General’), the band has released four
albums that exhibit a wide range of influ-
ences and their immense talent. Originally
called “One Fell Swoop,” the band switched
their name to avoid copyright issues with a
little-known West coast band of the same
name. Their first album, Silent Steeples, was
originally released in 1996. Bang, Bang, the
group’s second attempt, came out in 1997
and showed that the band was more than just
soft acoustic rock. In 1999 Four Day Trials
was released and, aided by 2000’s Who Are
We Living For?, widened the band’s fan
base. According to the band’ s official website
(www.dispatchmusic.com), “Despite their
variances, every Dispatch recording displays
the seasoned songwriting, infectious melo-

dies and ambitious three part harmonies that
define Dispatch’s signature sound.”

Assassin, from page 5

At first, it seems that The Blind Assassin
will be a fairly typical (if well-written) recol-
lection of an elderly woman’s life and the
circumstances surrounding her troubled
sister’s unexpected death. Only pages later,
however, the novel completely shifts genres
and introduces us to Laura Chase’s posthu-
mous work, The Blind Assassin. This novel-
within-a-novel narrates the affair between a
fugitive and his married, upper-class lover.

When the two meet, the man weaves astrange .

story about a doomed city on a distant planet.

Part sci-fi, part romance, part family drama,
part memoir — sometimes it seems as if The
Blind Assassin has too many aspects for its
own good. It is very tempting, especially at
the beginning, to ask why Atwood added this
second novel into the mix - despite the tenu-
_ ous connection of being written by Laura
Chase, the two pieces of the book don’t seem
to add much to one another. Just when
you’re becoming absorbed in Iris’ tale the

book shifts gears to the unnamed lovers, and
vice versa. Without revealing too much, Ican
only promise that the two are, in fact, inti-
mately connected, and as the book moves on
Atwood’s purpose becomes increasingly clear
until what we’ve come to suspect is vividly
confirmed.

The Blind Assassin, while not overly mo-
rose, is not a particularly cheerful book ei-
ther; Iris is repressed and passive, Laura
never quite seems to operate in the same
world as everyone else, and the relationship
between the two lovers teeters between affec-
tion and deep frustration. Even the sci-fi tale
is not typically silly escapist fare. In other
words, this is not a good book for someone
looking for a quick emotional pick-me-up
after a traumatic final exam ora boring
Thanksgiving dinner. For someone looking
to indulge a love of skilled writing and ab-
sorbing literature, however, The Blind Assas-
sin is a perfect choice.

In an attempt to describe the band’s so-
called “variances,” some have called their
music as a mix between rock, reggae, and
funk. Personally, I feel that their music is’
more than a simple combination or mix. At
times the band’s songs are best characterized
as a pleasant mix of all three music genres.
However, Dispatch also possesses the skill
to write a song like “Hey, Hey,” demonstrat-
ing their acoustic musical talent and their
lyrical skill, which contrasts their rock songs,
such as “Headlights.” This ability to per-
form both songs that encompass genres, as
well as to write specific types of songs, gives
Dispatch an added edge in eliciting listener
response while putting out an album and
performing on stage.

Also separating Dispatch from other groups
is their ability to switch instruments during
live shows. Nota cheap gimmick, each band
member actually plays a variety of instru-
ments on each album as well as when the
band is on tour. At their recent performance
at the Ritz, I witnessed the drummer get out
from behind his drums and plug in an acous-
tic guitar. Taking the main spotlight and

leading several of
the best songs of the
night, this move
kept the audience’s
attention on the
band’s music in-
stead of on any
single “front man.”

As for the show
itself, everyone, in-
cluding myself
came away thor-
oughly impressed.
According to Julie
Hwang (02), “I re-
ally enjoyed the
show... You could
tell that they were
having a good time
up there, which
made the audience
have fun, too... I
also really liked the
variety of the show,
from the way they
changed between
electric and acous-
tic, the fact that each
member of the group
could play all of the other instruments, and
the way that everyone sang lead at some
point... it was justa great show!” Dave Coffey
(02), who has been to several Dispatch
shows, saw the show as evidence of the
band’s growth. In his own words, “By blend-
ing their original acoustic sound with electric
sound, Dispatch has redefined themselves as
a true music force that will not flourish only
in preppy college communities.”

Holding onto their Northeastern fan base,
while at the same time expanding into new
markets in the South and the West, Dispatch
is a talented band on the rise. If you get the
chance, pick up any of their albums (my
personal favorite is Four Day Trials) or, even
better, go see them live. Despite their unique
sound and skills, do not be surprised if you
hear them on your radio stations back home
or see them in your friends’ cd collections.
Dispatch is here to stay and will only get
bigger over the coming years.
