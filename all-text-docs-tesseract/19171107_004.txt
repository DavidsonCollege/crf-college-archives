A LETTER FROM KOREA.

Pyengyang, Korea, Sept. 3, 1917.
Dear Davidson Boys:

August has gone by even more quickly
than usual, it seems to me, and school
work has begun in earnest. ‘The Acad-
emy opened last Wednesday, and Col-
lege opens Thursday next. There are

almost three hundred students in thet

Academy, and we are still busy register-
ing and examining them, tho classes be-
gan at once. Since I am the treasurer
of both College and Academy, this has
made me pretty busy the last few days.
The rush has let up a little today, but
will begin again day after tomorrow
with the college boys. This term I have
six hours per week in the Academy in
English. Have met my classes there,
and they are a nice lot of boys, and seem
to be very bright, tho English is very
hard for them. Besides this I have my
same subjects—English (one class), An-
alytic Geometry, Trigonometry, and Al-
gebra—with the possible addition of
Calculus in the college. I say the pos-
sible addition of Calculus because that
study is optional, and Koreans are not
strong enough on Mathematics to always
want to choose a course as hard as Cal-
culus. After this year, however, I shall
probably have more students in the high-
er classes.

I have written you of Mr. Reiner's
illness, I believe. He went to Sorai
Beach the middle of July expecting to
stay two weeks, but became very sick and
had to stay at Sorat all the summer,
and is still there. ton weak to take up
any work. Mrs. Reiner came home last
week, but is going back tomorrow, as
they expect to be in Sorai two months
longer, as the doctors advise Mr. Reiner
that he certainly cannot take up work
before that time. Mr. Bernheisel, in ad-
dition to his regular classwork in the
college, has had to take Mr. Reiner’s
place as principal at both the Academy
and the college, and he has all he can
do. Mr. Bernheisel has thirty country
churches to oversee (tho many of them
have native pastors), but he cannot pos-
sibly get to them this fall, and the sta-
tion will have to make some other pro-
vision. In consequence of President
Reiner’s absence we are all a little busier,
of course, and his classes will have to be
looked after, too. We are expecting
Mr. Soltau this week to help out until
Mr. Erdman, who is assigned to college
work this year, gets back from Amer-
ica. Mr. Bolling Reynolds, of our mis-
sion, got in last week, and most of the
Japanese teachers have come now.

In the return of the Academy boys |
have gotten back my regular Sunday
school class, all of whom I am glad to
see. 1 enjoyed the various substituting I
did during the summer, and some old
men I had were very attentive and in-
terested, but the boys last Sunday were
so responsive that it did me worlds of
good, and we were mutually helped, 1
do believe. How these people do crave
Bible teaching. Up here they have had
much more training than they have had
yet in the South, and are more advanced,
of course, but they are the same people
in their eagerness for study. And we
have to prepare and study well to have
a message to give them. But oh, what
an inspiration it is to see their response!
Last Sunday the lesson was on the riot
at Ephesus, and there were many things
in regard to the heathen beliefs and wor-
ship at that city in Paul’s time that could
be understood most readily by these
people who have themselves so recently
had many similar beliefs. As all traces
of that false worship of the Ephesian
Diana have now completely disappeared
from off the face of the earth, so we
know, and these believers know, that all
traces of the false religions and super-
stitions of this land will disappear, and

crumble to the earth before our coming|THE SOUTHERN SERVES THE SOUTH/L. C. BRAND. 2

King. It was a great lesson for mission-
aries as well as for the. Koreans.

We all keep well here. As you have
probably heard, Mr. Venable is having
to take Mrs. Venable home, as she has
become worse instead of better, and is
now in a very bad condition. He hopes
to put her in an institution, and return
to keep on with his work here. The
children will be left at Chunju. Word
comes from home that Mr. Wilson has
a tumor and that he can never hope to
be any better, tho by frequent tapping
the doctors say he can live. We are
much saddened by this news from the
South.

Remember the work and the mission-
aries in prayer. Our prayers go up
for you especially at this time. Miss
Gittens, who has just come out from
America, says that seeing the boys go off
to war now, brings the fact home to us,
and we realize it more and more out
here.
soldier boys as they go into training or
into active service, and may He speedily
bring peace to the earth again.

May this year be the best for you
each one.

With all best wishes, as ever,

Yours in the Master's service,
Wo. P. Parker.

THE MINISTER, A MAN TOO,

DISCUSSED AT MEETING|Phe Bank of Davidson

At the Ministerial Band meeting last
Sunday the subject discussed was ‘“The
Minister, a Man “Too!” W. B. Knox,
D. M. Orgain and W. C. Frierson led
in the discussion. They emphasized the
fact. that the minister's work was to
reach men, and that he would be unable
to accomplish his purpose if he did not
mingle with men and catch their view-
point. ‘The minister is not, and can not
be a superman, and he will fail miserably
in his task if he thinks of himself in that
light or allows others to think of him
in that light.

The question for the next meeting
was announced as “The part Ministerial
