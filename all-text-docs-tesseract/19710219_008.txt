SGA Vice-president’ Bill
Alexander, who _ introuced
DuRant’s motion. onto the
floor, expressed concern
over the method of balloting
and the 2/3 ruling. ‘‘We have
enough trouble just getting
2/3 of the student body to
vote.

“This interpretation of the
2/3 vote absurd, and it would
give’ the -senate unlimited
power because a- referen-
dum would never pass. The
method of voting iteslf has
a lot of discrepancies.’ '

After DuRant’s was re-
corded, a subsequent motion
from Sittler to reopen price
negotiations with Davis was
defeated 17-2.

Burney. then brought up
another’ motion to censure
Presdient Spencer for his
Statement on Davis. ‘tHe is
saying on behalf of the col-
lege,’’ “Burney stated,
he does not feel his speaker
is fit to appear on campus.
He has said something that
is not in his position to say.”

Golden Leads Discussion
On Venereal Disease

By ALEC HOON
News Editor

“Syphilis is very demo-
_ cratic. . .anybody can catch
it.”

Thus spoke Ed Golden, a
field worker for the North
Carolina State Board. of
(Health, to the honorary pre-
medical fraternity: Alpha
Epsilon Delta and interest-
ed student on the problems
of venereal disease.

Golden cénducted an_in-
formative discussion on all
aspects of the problem,
highlighted by a film deal-
ing with the diagnosis. of
syphilis.

The talk was” directed™ pri- a
marily “toward the premedi-

cal. students-the future doc-
tors who. would e ntually

be responsible for treating
venereal diseases.

Outlining his job as a field
worker, Golden stated that
‘‘my assignment is present-

ly in the Charlotte area. I

conduct clinics. wherever
an outbreak of venereal dis-
ease occurs.

‘It is also, my responsibi-
lity to track down possible
carriers of the disease from
information supplied to me
by persons afflicted 2: ve-
nereal disease.

‘This is why doctors iat
report cases immediately
upon diagnosis. Otherwise,
it is jmpossible for field
workers like myself to lo-

—¢cate —and—treat those who

either contracted the disease
from or who infected the re-
ported ‘case.”’

* Cornell Seeking Possible

| Develagiantal Appointees

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

In an exclusive interview
with THE DAVIDSONIAN
this week, Vice President of
Finance and Development
C. David ‘Cornell hinted that
a major appointment would
soon to made to fill the pre-
sently vacant position of Di-
rector of Development.

Since. Robert A. Currie is
the director of the Financial
Department * of the’ College,
Cornell ifelt that there should
be a comparable position in
Depart-
ment. These two _ positions
will be directly responsible
to Cornell.

The Director of Develop:
ment will primarily be in-
volved in activities concern-
ing fund raising and public
relations. ‘‘Davidson College
is ‘grossly understaffed in

have to use it, and then only
as a last resort. Its purpose
is to convey the idea of a
time sequence to emphasize
the importance of the reso-
lution,”’

The resolution passed 14-5,
and.another motion to strike
the boycott from the pro.
posal failed 10-7. Turner
said he intends to bring it
up -for further discussion
next week,

campus ‘as a fraternity it
will be a fraternity indepen-
dent of (Daidvson College
and it may not use the name
of Davidson College.”’

Terry emphasized that ‘‘I
didn't say that ,they could
eat off campus.”’

‘President Samuel 'R. Spen-
cer said that his office has

‘“nbt been approached offici-

ally with any request by a
fraternity to eat off cam-
pus. :
““TIt's of course my respon-
sibility to see that college
policy is carried out,’’ Spen-
cer said. ‘‘As far as I’m
concerned the question is
still a hypothetical one.”’
Spencer said that he hop-

ed that. the, nationals would ~

work with the . administra-
tion and stay on campus un-
der the new social system.

The proposed action by
the Gamms will affect: more
than just that particular
house. At Jeast five other
houses will be watching the
administrative reaction -to
the Gamm attempt to ope-
rate off, campus.

Spokesmen for the Kappa.

Alpha, Sigma Phi Epsilon,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma
Chi, and Phi Delta Theta
fraternities have indicated

“that their’ houses are very

seriously considering mov-
ing off campus and. that
they are interested in the
possibility of setting up eat-
ing facilities away from the
campus.

Besides the plunge taken

by the Gamms, recent ac-

tions of the town council
should have much influence

this area,"’ said Cornell.

“*A 1967 study of schools
about the size of Davidson
reported that the average
school employed five  pro-
fessional fund - raisers,” he
said. ‘It is a proven fact
that schools that employ
men in a development de-
partment repay their invest-
ment of salaries several
times over.”

Cornell said he is still in-
terviewing people for the
job. He noted that the. job
of Director of Development
at Davidson is a very desir-
able position and that a
number of people have ex-
pressed interest in it.

Concerning the issue of co-
education, Cornell said that
if Davidson is to retain its
present ceiling of 1,000 stu-
dents, it would be unecono-
mical for this college to ad-
mit women on a full time
basis.

“The minute we say ‘wo-
men,’ =we have introduced a
variable,”’ he said. ‘‘If_.wo-
men are to become student's
here we must review the en-

tire scheme of academic
and social life.
‘‘Coeducation would re-

_ quire more emphasis on the

creative arts: drama, music,
and art. It would also neces-
sitate a beefing up of
courses in the fields of so-
ciology and psychology.

on upcoming moves from
the fraternity court.

It had been assumed by
many fraternities that the
town of Davidson would

frown on the prospect of

¢ fraternities moving off cam-

pus into the community.
However, in the meeting
of the town council Monday
night town officials were re-
portedly very receptive to
the idea of fraternities ob-
taining housing within the
town. ’
Presently, there are cer-
tain zoning laws for the
town of Davidson, passed
years ago when the first col-
lege fraternities left the

Student housing would be
another consideration.”’

Cornell said that at pre-
sent the issue of coeducation
is ‘kicking around in the
minds of various admin-
istrators;'’ however no for-
mal investigation is planned.

The Vice President of Fin-
ance and.Development also
said that he is concentfating
on persuading corporations
and foundations; to grant
money to the college.

Cornell and College Presi-
dent Samuel (R. Spencer Jr.
traveled this week to Flori-
da to meet with the execu-
tives of a foundation as well
as to talk with ‘‘special
donors.”’
