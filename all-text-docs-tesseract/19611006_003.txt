Harriers Visit Citadel:

The Davidson cross-country team trav els to Charleston, S. C., tomorrow afternoon

‘for a meet with The Citadel.

The harriers are looking for
a repeat of last year’s 22-33
victory over the Bulldogs. Com-
ments Coach Heath Whittle,
“They have been Conference
track champions for the past
two or three years, so they have
some good runners.

“I'm looking for a real close
meet,” concluded Whittle.

Wednesday afternoon the
‘Cat harriers lost to a strong
Wake Forest team, 24-31 (low
score wins). Despite the team
loss, Co-captain Sterling Martin

fort that left the first Wake run-

ADVERTISING PAYS

The old cliche, “It pays to advertise,” applies to
colleges and universities as well as business. Prospective
students must know something about a school before they
will enroll, just as prospective buyers must know some-
thing about a product before they will buy.

Davidson is no exception. We must continue to ad-
vertise if we want to continue to enroll top high school
graduates. Despite our high academic rating and our
extreme popularity among educational circles of the

South (notably Converse, Salem, etc.), we are quite un- |

known in many parts of the U.S. A.

This past summer, we told an Oregonian where we
went to school. He looked puzzled for a second, and then
replied, “Oh yea. That’s in Rhode Island, isn’t it?”

To enlighten those unfamiliar with our school, the
college has hired Mr..Taylor Blackwell, our new publicity
man.

One of Blackwell's most important jobs will be to re-
lease athletic news and pictures to the wire services. We
have felt all along that Davidson has needed a full time

man in‘this capacity, and we're glad that the college has |

taken such a step. A sports publicity man is just as im-
portant to an athletic system as the players, coaches,
and trainers.

We also feel that one of the best ways to advertise
our school is on the athletic field. By this we don't mean
that we should devote all our money and efforts to build-
ing an invincible athletic machine, which is the case in
many of the nation’s larger schools.

What we do mean is that we should constantly be
striving to improve our athletic teams, just as we con-
stantly strive to improve our academic program.

If this means giving more scholarships, then let's
give more scholarships. If it means a more extensive re-
cruiting program, then let's get one. If it means paying
our coaches more, then let’s do so.

However, we are not in favor in anyway whatsoever
of a laxity in our academic standards. We simply be-
country today to fill up fifty Davidson’s. So why don't we
go after them a little harder?

THE CRYSTAL BALL (13-5)
Davidson is the only idle team in the conference to-
morrow as inter-conference action really gets underway.
We predict: Richmond 21, The Citadel 8; Furman 35,
William & Mary 6; VMI 14, George Washington 7; and
West Virginia 21, VPI 14.
