Sunday in the Park with George entertains and challenges

By Jacob Abraham

Sunday in the Park with
George is by no means an easy
show to perform: the music is too
complicated to be memorable, the
storyline is fragmented and often
surreal, and the theme of the show
is hard to grasp. James Lapine’s
complicated story examines the
lives of George Seurat and his
great-great-grandson, as they
struggle with various forces which
would pull them away from their
work and restrict their artistic vi-

sion.

Although comedic elements
are present throughout the show,
Sunday in the Park does not set out
merely to entertain, but to chal-
lenge its viewers to consider the
price of making great art. The
spectacular orchestra pulls off
Stephen Sondheim’s carefully
crafted score with brilliance, and
several outstanding performances
from cast members make the mu-
sical work.

The show opens in the late

nineteenth century, as young
George Seurat is struggling to
breathe life into his fledging career
as a painter. Seurat is a visionary
who refuses to be bound by con-
ventional techniques, and conse-
quently never finds much success
during his life.

Nevertheless, George’s bru-
tally obsessive personality arouses
strong emotional responses from
everyone around him. His peers
both envy his ability and despise
his refusal to use established paint-
ing approaches; meanwhile, his
curious drive and good looks at-
tract the attention of women all
around him.

The first act focuses on the
relationship between George and
Dot, his mistress. George’s obses-
sion with finding the intrinsic har-
mony in his surroundings, and
translating that harmony into art,
make him a neglectful and irre-
sponsible lover. -

Dot, who is drawn in by
George’s unique talent and per-
sonality, must nevertheless aban-
don him to seek a husband with a
more stable, sensible way of life.
George’s conflicting emotions are
portrayed masterfully by Adam
Karsten, who displays the passion-
ate intensity which simultaneously
destroys his relationship with Dot
while birthing his pointillist mas-
terpiece, “A Sunday Afternoon on

the Island of La Grande Jatte.”

The other characters, each
taken from the “La Grande Jatte”
painting, rarely interact with
George beyond serving as —
for his paintings.

Several of the actors, particu-
larly the Southern tourist couple

.playedby Ty Stoverand Tari Fitch,

provide hilarious comic relief.
Wendy Brown, however, steals the
show as Dot. Her pristine voice
and emoting make the audience
sympathize with her frustrated at-
traction to George. “We should
have belonged together,” she wist-

fully sings, before running off to |

America with her new husband,
Louis the baker.

Dot carries with her an acci-
dental token of her relationship
with George, their unborn daugh-
ter Marie.

Marie forms the bridge be-
tween the two acts, as the story
jumps to America in 1980s. Many
ofthe actors return in parallel roles
for the second act.

Karsten gets more of the spot-
light as Seurat’s distant grandson,
also named George.

Like the first George, he is
obsessed with innovation, creat-
ing bizarre laser art with a device
known as a “chromulume.”
Brown’s witty performance as the
elderly Marie again outshines the
other characters.

Attempting to create an artis-
tic memorial to “La Grande Jatte,”
young George must also struggle
with the expectations of others.
On one hand, the curators and crit-
ics who put pressure on George to
make conventional, marketable art;
on the other hand, Marie, whourges
him to marry and have children
while pursuing his art.

In the final scene, George is
eerily revisited by Dotand the char-
acters from the first act, who in-
spire his work by introducing him
to the central harmony and ideal-
ism of Seurat’s painting.

The musical illustrates the
various contending forces which
can pull an artist away from his art,
while underlining the sacrifices an
artist must make to preserve his
vision.

The production succeeds in
making the audience consider these
themes, while providing enough
comedy and interesting music to
keep the audience amused. The
Stage is an exact replica of the
background of “La Grande Jatte,”
and the props, including a huge
transparent reproduction of the
painting, are effective without en-
croaching on the actors’ perfor-
mances.

Sunday in the Park is hardly
light entertainment, but this un-
usual musical succeeds in spite of
the difficulty of its subject matter.
