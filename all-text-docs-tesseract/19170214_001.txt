Vol. IV.

Local Floor.

ELON GAME.

In an exciting, but rather poorly play-
ed game, Davidson defeated [lon last
Wednesday night for the second time
this season, the final score being 28 to 19.
The game seemed a little. rough, espe-
cially in the latter part, and many close
and easy shots were missed by both
teams. Elon’s passing was good, but
when it came to shooting goals they
were decidedly off-color. The score was
close at all times, with Davidson holding
the lead thruout.

“Eddie” Childs lead in. the field work
with five goals to his credit, while “Al”
Reese had a perfect score, caging all
eight of the fouls called on Elon. “Bob”
Walker, besides plaving his usual good
guarding game, shot another goal and

received an ovation. Franks and Sorrells,

were Flon’s leading contenders.
The line-up was as follows :,

ever seen on the local court, the States-
ville team defeated the Davidson quin!
Mondav night by the score of 30 to 28
Altho the game was hard fought thru-
out, the Statesville team managed to
keep the long end of the score all the
time. Both sides plaved excellent ball.

Debating Finals Held
On Last Monday Night

Two Teams Are Selected For Con-
tests This Spring.

On Monday night the finals for the
inter-collegiate debating teams were
held in Shearer Hall. Eight men, prev-
iously chosen by means of a preliminary
The
subject was, “Resolved, “Phat the United
States should adopt a policy of uni-
versal compulsory military service.” A
committee from the Faculty, composed
of Dr. J. M. MceConnetl, Dr, Sentelle.
Professor Fulton. and Professor Reed,
eelected the following to campose the
two teams that Davidsyn will have this
Soring: G. C. Bellirerath (Bud. W.
H. Neal (Phi) R. HH. Ratchford (Phi),
and J. A. Thames (Phi. RoW.
Cousar (Eu), and L. HL Fikel (Eu),

were chosen as alternates.

The debate was spirited thruout. es
pecially the rejoinder, and cach man put
up an excellent effort. G. C, Bellingrath
was the first speaker far the afirmative.

and elaimed that the present defense of

the United States was inadequate. and
that the pronoced system would mect
the present deficiencies.

Cousar, the first speaker for the nega

tive, denied the necessity for universal
military service, as our defense must be
navel, He alco maintained that the pro-
nostl was incompatible with democratic
principles.

W. H. Neal. next for the affirmative
argued that universal service was con-

sistent with democratic principles, and
thar it did nor lead to militarism.
H. Fikel aleo claimed = that the

United States did not need a large mili
tary force and it) was undemocratic
and would surely lead to war.

T. A. Thames. continuing | for the
affirmative, attacked the present military
policy of the United States as heing in-
adequate and fallacions, and shawed the
physical and economic value of military
training.

R. H. Ratchford follawed far the
negative, and said the cost of fhe pro
posed system made it prohibitive, and
pointed out) wherein it) was undemo
cratic and unnecessary.

The last sneaker for the affirmative
was C. FEF. Patterson. and he argued
that the dav for peace had not vet ar
rived, and that the United States wae

unprepared to enter anv war: He also
claimed universal service was demo-
cratic.

G. F. Weber closed for the negative.
and denied that the United States wac
in danger, and claimed that the adontior
of compulsory service would lead te
militarism and war.

The composition of the two teams has
not heen decided vet. but will be in the
course of the next few days. Davidson
dchates Emory at Decatur. Ga.. and
Roanoke. at Salem. Va... this Spring.
Both debates will come in April.

Dr. Martin will speak at the First

No. 18

Is Nearing Its Close

Juniors Defeat Fresh, and Fresh
and Sophs Tie.

JUNIOR-FRESH GAME

Last Wednesday afternoon in the
third game of the class football series.
Juniors defeated the Fresh by the
score.of 7 too. “Phe game. was close
and hotly contested at all stages.

An the second quarter, after a. long
end run by “Bob” Jones, Patterson
carried the ball over for a touchdown
for the luniors, and Therrell kicked
goal, The hall then sec sawed from
25-yard line to 2§-vard line, with  fre-
auent exchange of punts, until the last
few minutes of play, when the Fresh re.
cavered a punt and by a series of line
plunges carried the ball to the Tuniors’
to-vard line, when the whistle blew.

For the Juniors, Armstead, Tones and
Patterson wert the outstanding stats.
while Harris. Sizer and McMaster did
exceedingly well for the Fresh,

‘The line-up was as follows:

FRESU-SOPTE GAME.
Last Saturday in perhaps the most in
teresting game af the class fanthall series

olaved so. far, the Sophs battled the
Fresh to a no-score tie, The plaving
conditions, contrary. to the rule, were

most excellent, and this added much. to
the class of the contest. From the
first kick off. it was evident to the spec
tators that the Fresh. strengthened by
the return of Captain Cgawford, had the
edge on their strong opponents. The
sncedy little quarterback seemed ‘ta gain
almost at will and- kept the ball in Soph
territory for much of the — tine.
Toward the Jase part of the — secand
auarter, the Fresh carried the ball to
their appdnents’ s-yard line and a score
seemed certain, but the Sophs held on
the first three downs, and just as a plas
was being called for an attempt ata
field goal. the whistle blew for the end
of the half,

The Fresh threatened to score several
times in the last two periods. but were
unable to make gains at critical stages.
The last few minutes of play proved
esnecially exciting, freauent passes being
effected and intercepted in rapid succes-
sion,

For the Fresh “Frankie” Crawford
was the outstanding star, while Harris.
Moore and McMaster put un esorcially
strane games. For the Sonhs, White.
Worth. Clark and Roswell were laroely
responsible for the good work of their
team. ,
