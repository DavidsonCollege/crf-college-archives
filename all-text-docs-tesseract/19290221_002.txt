AND WHAT HAVE YQU?

A Vocational Guidance Editorial

Charles M. the
Steel magnate, gives his plan of
succeeding in the business world
in a book entitled “Succeeding
With What You Have” in words
which are of interest to college
students, a part of which follows:

Schwab, great

“We are all salesmen, selling
our ideas, our plans, our energies,

whom we come in contact. [have
always felt that the surest way to

work a little harder than anyone
else on the job that one is hold-
ing down.

“The man who has done his best

fatal to success than taking one’s
job as a matter of course.”

Mr. Schwab says very striking-
ly, “If more persons would get
so enthusiastic Over their day’s
work that someone would have to
remind them to go out to lunch,
there would be more happiness in
the world and less indigestion,”

As to how to win he
says, “If a young man entering
industry were to ask for advice,

afraid of imperiling your health
by giving a few extra hours to the
company that pays your salary!

say

Bare hands grip suc-
cess better than kid gloves. Be
thorough in all things, no matter-
how small or distasteful. The
man who counts his hours and
kicks about his salary is a self-
enacted falure.”

All of which reminds us that
very soon we shall have the op-
portunity of hearing words of ad-
vice and suggestions from many
and varied lines of vocational ac-
tivity when the Vocational Guid-
ance Institute is conducted under
the auspices of the local Y. M. C.
A. from more angles than simply
the one as suggested by Mr,
Schwab.

Leading men in the several vo-
cations have been secured/to come
here for this period to aid that
large group of undecided men in
choosing a life work and to ad-
vise with those who have already
determined upon vocation. And
then, there is another great bene-
fit to be derived. Each student,
although he may know much
about his own vocation, will
usually be unfamiliar with the
others which are to be represent-
ed. Would this not be a splendid
opportunity for every man to
catch the point of view of the

_ doctor, the lawyer, the manufac-

turer, the minister, the teacher,
and the others, as the different

professions are represented by

A CHANGED SCHEDULE.

, Three motives seem to have
prompted the recent adoption of
a new schedule of classes for next
term by the faculty, and criticisms
of varying * natures upon an-
houncement of the change calls
for an attempt at explanation,

Hirst, the change of the chapel
hour from 8:30 to 10:20 is evi-
dently a good one affording a bet
ter chapel service in itself and an
hour or two of sleep—if one has
no first hour classes. The latter
will be the most important item
in student eyes. The chapel serv-
ice will he at a time of thé morn-
ing when the attitude will be more
attentive and when there will be
less of distraction in the Way of
lately procured mail.

The second notable change is
doubtful as to its advantage. The
idea back. of the shift of the lunch
hour to 12:30 seems to have been
that there was too long an inter-
val between breakfast and the
1:30 meal, but the feeling on the
part of students has been that of
preferring to wait until later if
there is the likelihood that there
will be no afternon classes. There
will be the long. period between
the noon and evening meals in-
stead of in the morning, and so it
seems to bea matter of choice.

In the shifting of classes from
the morning to the afternon in
order that the present congestion
may be relieved and that more
courses may be available ‘to a
larger number there is an evident
improvement even though the
idea of afternoon recitations may
not meet with immediate ap-
proval.

It should be ‘realized that
schedules of any kind are difficult
to arrange and especially is this
true when there must be the ap-
proval of such a large number as
faculty and students constitute.

A NEW SONG?

Davidson need a new
The question is broad, a
new song for what
The answer is, Davidsom does
need a new song. -Davidson needs
anew song, for the student gathr-
ings, for all occasions where the
college is concerned. At present,
“Oh Davidson” is a spirited march,
it is suitable for the football field,
both words and music; but in oth-
er lines of sports, the words of the
song mean nothing. The present
song is something to stir a man
when he sees a football team upon
the field. But is it something that
will stir a man whenever he hears
it?

Does

is

The song “Alma Mater” has a
good lyric, but the tune is old, it

is not: owned by Davidson, many
other colleges and universities
use it. After a man leaves David-

son the tune as he hears it will
mean the to many other
men, It might be played as his
“Alma Mater,” or it might be
played as the song of some other
school.

same

This tune is sometimes to
move the listened, but it has» no
personal appeal to just one stu-
dent body.

\ song or tune is needed by Da-

vidson, a song that will sweep
everyone to his feet when it is
first sounded. A song that is

original, one that will be individ-
ual. Not a marching song for the
football field, not an old tune with
merely words full of meaning, but
a new lyric And music. Of course
such a song cannot be born merely
out of the air, for it must have
ome emotional feeling behind it
when it is written, but surely there
is someone in school that is able to
combine the musical ability and the
emotional desire to write a song that
will be for Davidson, of Davdson,
and part of Davidson in years to
come.

BOOSTER OR KNOCKER

In all colleges the majority of the
men can he divided into two main
classes. The boosters or the knock-
ers. Some will not come under
either class, but they are few in
number. .\ll colleges are full of the
eternal gripers, the ones that are al-
ways willing to kick about some-
thing, to unload upon the faculty
and the college the full burden of
anything that goes wrong, Also the
colleges are full of many men that
are doing theif part to make the col-
lege a better place in which to live,
to improve the college, and if any-
thing goes wrong, to place the blame
upon themselves, rather than upon
the long suffering administration.

Vo which class do most of the
Davidson men belong? Such is the
“esprit d’corp” at Davidson that one
is led to the observation that the
majority belong to the class of
hoosters. There are knockers at
Davidson, there always will be, for
it is human for some men to gripe at
nothing, But that class can be cut
down, There are enough boosters
at the college to outnumber the
knockers in noise, and that’s what
the knockers mainly do, raise a lot
of fuss about nothing The boost-
ers of Davidson can out-weigh’ the
knockers, but they must make them-
selves heard. Too often the real
supporters of the college say too
little, they allow the gripers to say
too much to hurt the college, for
where a knocker is loud, the booster
is generally silent.

The only way that this can he
overcome is for the real boosters to
come forward and say a good word
for the college. Too long have the
real men kept silent while the others
criticised everything in sight. Many
men say nothing in defense of mat-
ter when someone is attacking them
unjustly. The time for the booster
is anytime. Any time that someone
is hurting the college by word or ac-
tion, then it is the proper time for
the constructive man to do his part
for the good of the college.

OPEN FORUM |

Mr. Editor:
Doubtless the tentative schedule for
next year has been carefully considered

by both faculty and students. Never-
theless in various discussions among
campus members, several points: have

mentioned both for and against the new
regime.

Five minutes in the morning does not
make any great difference, But how
will sick call be arranged? Either those
students who are sick must attend two
classes, miss breakfast, or else they must
practically all miss the entirety of the
first class period. There is a question
as to which is the more advisable course,
to miss one class, or chapel.

Then, please consider the case of the
boys who have boarding house work,
Tt is all many of them can do to get
to class hy the first period now, In
addition to having class immediately af-
ter breakfast, as provided for under the
new plan, many of those who do not
have classes will sleep late and go to
breakfast | at a later hour. It takes a
hardhearted man to refuse a friend his
breakfast.

As usual there seem to be arguments
both pro and con, but many members of
the student body are in doubt. Also many
Sophomores who were contemplating en-
rolling for advanced work in the R. O.
T. C. department have declared that they
are reluctant to do this since all the
drills are in the afternoon.

Hopefully, yours,

SCHOLASTIC DELINQUENCY
CRITICIZING THE SCHEDULE

University of Washington Daily—Dur-
ing the course of the scolastic year con-
cluded last June, some sixteen hundred
students acquired grades sufficiently low
to convince the University their presence
at this school was quite unnecessary,
Hence the compilation of the names of the
aforementioned group to form the flunk
list.

“You didn't study,” professors told the
majority of the students dissatisfied with
their fate. To which accusations the
students usually retorted with the re-
butalS of illness and over-work.

These causes, as well as several others
Were responsible for the size of the flunk
list. A faculty member has compiled a
plausible list of reasons for unsatisfaz-
tory work, including the following nine
suggestions :

1. Insufficient high school training.
Students who lack the solid foundation
of a thorough preparatory education are
seriously handicapped. They have not
learned to study effectively, to concentrate
on their work,

2. Mental incapacity. In some cases
students are unable to grasp their studies,
to think and work under pressure. As
a rule these students have comparatively
poor memories. '

3. Wrong mental attitude.

4. Physical handicaps.

5. Outside work or campus activities
are emphasized too heavily,

6. Schedules ate too heavy.

7. Failure to study.

8. Poor quality of instruction.
9.

Fitancial or family difficulties,

An interesting list, and one that ex-
plains for’the most part a list that in-
cluded sixteen hundred names.

’ THE MODERN STUDENT
AND RELIGION

S. M. U. Campus—It is no secret that
a large percentage of modern young peo-
ple have turned away from organized re-
ligion because of skepticism as to its
sufficiency. In a recent address before
the Forum of S. M. U., Rabbi David
Lefkowitz advised: “Tf Wwe “possess doubts
on certain things, my advice is to go and
study the matter out.”

Herein lies the failure of many students
in their dealing with religion. The slight-
est doubt and uncertainty leads to the
hasty conclusion, that religion is a mere
fancy and the c hurch a hypocritical
agency. There is no “studying of the
matter out” with them: no thinking t he
thing through. Even the profoundest of
churchmen have honest queries concern-
ing mysteries which they never expect
to hear answered, but their faith is none
the less staunch. Happy would youth be
could it learn that truth.

The youth today possesses a most ad-
mirable critical faculty, Such a posses-
sion is valuable, provided it is used sin-
cerdly. We find youth using it in rela-
tion to literature, art, the stage, and
the home—and often with laudable results,
But youth itself—rather than the church
Plays the hypocrite by scientifically fer=
