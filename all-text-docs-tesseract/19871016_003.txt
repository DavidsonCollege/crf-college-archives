Automobiles can be lots of fun, if Dad is paying for the damages

By BILL SCOUTEN .

Did any of y’all read the “Liv-
ing” section of Tuesday’s Char-
lotte Observer? No? It’s a good
thing. I was really bored with
what should have been an article
about an “unusual job” or “weird
job stories.” Instead, I was intro-
duced to a rather dry, almost
pointless article about raising
chickens for a pharmacology pro-
fessor’s research. How mundane.
Who cares about chickens any-
way?! Come on, Alan Norwood,
get a real column! You want real
excitement, real stupidity, or just
plain teal humor? Take a look at |

what Davidson College can
offer... our students never run
out of it.

Take, for instance, the girl
that drove to The Pantry in_Cor-
nelius to do some shopping and
found her key stuck in the igni-
tion. This is really dumb! “Oh
well, I'll just shop and leave the
keys in the car,” she thought. —
After shopping, she returned to
her car to find that the keys were
still lodged in the key slot . . .did
she really think that the keys
would miraculously become “un-
stuck” while she shopped? Need-
less to say, the car remained in
The Pantry’s parking lot over-
night. Is this not enough for you?
We have more!! Why is. it that au-
tomobiles always have something
wrong with them?!

Do you remember the first
time you got in a car and actually
drove it? Most students seem to
remember. (I know, I remember.)
In fact, many related stories of
dismay to me and mused about
their aftermath.

Figs. As

It’s really sort of funny to
think that Davidson students boast
of above-average SAT scores and
high intelligence when, in the car,
many of-us act like neanderthals.
We're not talking about tame
apes, either. No! I’m referring to

fhe hard core, atavistic student/

driver with the “don’t pass me or
Pll show you who’s boss” at-
titude. The type of driver who re-
sides in the backwoods of Tennes-
see on Hickscut Road . . .sort of
like Cary Murrey, who said “you
know I don’t pay a lot of attention
while driving, but I can park acar,
and I haven’t gotten a ticket yet!”

You know, the kind of driver

who, when first learning to drive,
backs out of a driveway taking
two other cars with him. Come
on, I bet you were in the same
boat! When you were parking the
car, you probably ‘hit the ac-
celerator instead. of the brake and

‘took the back half of the garage

with you. Or what about the one
that passed (or was passing)
another car, when the other car all
of a sudden hung a left? (By the
way, the driver is ok — well, he’s
at Davidson — but the mailbox
he hit is no more.)

After $1600 damage. and a
sheepish grin, all that Dad can say

(with gritted teeth) is: “it’s al-.

right.” Come on, who is he trying
to fool? You know as well as I that
he is hoppin’ mad. But, as a
father, he keeps it inside and
writes the check out to the body
shop with a shaking hand. Parents
are almost all alike im this respect.
But poor Helen Bell, a new
driver, was given her Dad’s car to

drive to school one day because it
looked like rain. Yes, it rained al-
right. And, when it rains, it pours!
Helen switched on the windshield
wipers, and before long a high-
pitched whine was heard which
quickly became a really loud
noise. Helen said that she had to
yell just to talk in the car. Her yell
was nothing compared to her
father’s when she arrived at home,
though. The rubber had worn off
the metal windshield wipers that
had, therefore, scratched the
windshield. Her father was quite
‘irate from what I understand.

Now you're in college,
though. You don’t have these “ac-
cident” problems anymore.
You've moved up in the driving
world. . . you worry now about
mechanical problems. And how
frequently they occur!

Ask Gagan Singh about her

— go-in with the good old automo-
tive engine. It must really be frus-
trating to be driving a friend to
Charlotte (in search of garters?)
when all of a sudden the oil light
blinks on. Oh, no! What now?
(personally, I would be showing a
bit of concen.) Gagan drove on,
though, until she found an Amoco
station. Smoke, smoke, and more
smoke came billowing out from
under the car’s hood. How embar-
rassing! After two more stops, the
prognosis: new radiator. Well,
they did get to Eastland Mall via a
taxi, found the garters, and re-
turned to the station to pick up
Gagan’s car. Five hundred dollar
later, Gagan told me, with a
smile, the car “works perfectly

now.” Dad must have loved that!

Many college students just
don’t have enough money to af-
ford a really nice car. In other
words, some of us just have
“bombs”, like the old station
wagon that you and your friends
converted into a large convertible
for high school homecoming.
Yes, they get us around but the
circuitry is crossed, the body is
bent out of shape, or the car just
won’t start. Robert Austell’s VW
rabbit seems to fit this description
perfectly — especially on first

‘dates!

Picture this. Freshman year,
Robert asks Susan Roberson to go
with him to get donuts at Krispy
Kreme in Charlotte. (Real nice
first date, Robert!) The date was
fine until his car wouldn’t start.
Oh, but things got worse! At-
tempting to roll start- the car,
Robert ran into a truck and bent
the right door all the way back. It
would not close. Fortunately the
car did start later, and both re-
turned safely to Davidson. When
asked to comment on the alleged
date, Robert said, “it [the car]
never starts on first dates.”

You’ ve really got to watch out
for Robert’s car, though. This last
summer his car was the cause of a
major highway backup. During
five o’clock rush hour traffic on
one of South Carolina’s “‘not so
major” highways, Robert’s car
decided to stall out on a two-way
bridge, compounding the traffic
problem caused by an earlier

. wreck. Five police cars and

twenty minutes later, Robert got

out of the car and kicked it. The
next thing he knew, the car was re-
vving and ready to go. So, he left.
If you'd like to see this (in)fa-
mous, puke-green car, I'll direct
you to Main Street in front of
DCPC — it’s always there.

But once Davidson students
master the skills of driving and
have an able means of transporta-
tion, other forms of entertainment
on the street have to be found. |
was informed by Tom Larson that
there exists a rather challenging,
sometimes rewarding game
known as “picking up a girl or a
guy while at a stop light.” This
game should be played by people
above the age of 16, though.

The point of the game is to
“pick up” a member of the oppo-
site sex within a. time fraine of
thirty seconds. What’s the key?
Tom, speaking from experience,
suggests that the surest way of
picking up someone is to ask for
their phone number. As if you
don’t hear them, repeat the
number with one or two incorrect
digits so that the target person can
hear you. If the person corrects
you, then you’ve won the
game — he/she wants you to
call! What a challenge! Yandell
Wood suggests that you also in-
vest in a “Mr: Microphone” to fa-
cilitate the hearing of yout\yoice
from the car. I don’t know about

‘you, but I think that I'll try to
