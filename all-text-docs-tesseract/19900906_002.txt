Davidson and the World: The Middle East Crisis .

Davidson College’s Tom

Norwood has had a closer look at
ahe Iraqi crisis than anyone else at
the college. Immediately after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in early August,
Norwood reported for Air Force
reserve duty as pilot of a KC-10
refueling jet tanker.

For two weeks the college’s
director of corporate giving and
his crew flew missions over the
eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean
oceans, carrying up to 60,000 gal-
lons of fuel for air-to-air refueling
of jet fighters travelling from
America to Saudi Arabia. Nor-
wood landed cargo once in Saudi
* Arabia and spent a few hours on
the ground there, but flew most of
his missions from American bases
elsewhere. He was surprised by
the immense stretches of sand in
the area, and confirmed that, the
weather on the ground is very hot.

The crew stayed aloft for as
long as 24 hours ata stretch, fuel-
ing fighters and receiving fuel from
other tankers. The work could be
tricky, he said. “Air-to-air fueling
is always challenging. Then you

do it at night and throw in a little
weather...There were also lots of
airplanes in a close space.”

Because tankers are basically
flying gas tanks they are extremely
wulnerable to hostile fire.““Wedon’t
even carry parachutes because we
wouldn’tneed them,” he said. “But
because of what we do the Air
Force keeps us out of range of
enemy missiles.”

When the crisis broke, Nor-
wood knew thathis services would
probably be needed. So he called
his unit at Seymour-Johnson Air
Force Base in Goldsboro to volun-
teer, and they asked him to report
thatevening. He used his Davidson
vacation time to perform the duty.

He said morale among the US
troops he met was high, but that
Vietnam veterans like himself were
more serious about the US mission
and its possible consequences.
Norwood flew C-41s toward the
end of that conflict, carrying in-
jured and dead soldiers from Viet-
nam back to the states. “The main
impression I got then was the tre-
mendous human cost of the war,
however necessary it may be,” he
said.

He was also impressed at how

dangerous the current situation in
the Middle East appears. “It really
isatinderbox,” he said. “There (is)
atremendousamountof armaments
there, and a lot uncertainty about
who’sdoing what. Everyone knew
that if fighting broke out, it wasn’t
going to be a field day like in
Grenada and Panama.”

And while he and other troops
in training exercises habitually
complain aboutcarrying bulky and
heavy chemical protection suits,
Norwood said people on the way
to Saudi Arabia were happy to
have them.

Though he’s homenow, if war
breaks out Norwood expects to be
called back to duty. He said he
appreciates the support and con-
cem the community showed to-
ward his wife and family while he

need it even more if he is called
back to duty. He is a 1970
Davidson graduate who learned to
fly during his senior year at col-
lege, trading work hours at the old
Brockenborough Airport near
Metrolina Fairgrounds for flying
lessons. He gothis Air Force wings
in 1972 and is currently a captain
with the 77th Air Refueling group.

Activating Military \
Reserves Could Affect Up.
F To 187,000 Collegians

College Press Service

As many as 187,000 college
students across the country had
their fall term plans cast into doubt
Aug. 22, when president George
Bush said he would soon call up
military reservists to support and
replace troops already sent to the
Middle East.

If and when the call comes, the
students would have to leave school
abruptly, sometimes unsure if they
will have a place when thay return
or if the tuition money they paid
will be wasted.

“J don’t know what frame of
mindI’ll be in for my studies,” said
Junior Waldron, an Army reservist
who is a sophomore engineering
major at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in New York.

No one knows exactly. how
many of the reservists subject to
being called to active duty are
college students.

Joe Hanley, spokesman for the
U.S. Army reserves, estimated that
61 percent of his group’s 579,000
members are full- or part-time
college students.

The other branches of the
military do: not keep figures on
how many of their reservists are
students.

Colleges themselves typically
don’t know how many of their
students are subject to the military
call-up.

To find out, Drexel University
in Pennsylvania set up a hotline
Aug. 23 for any students or staff
who could be affected. by the
Middle East crisis, but received
just four calls-only one from a
student reservist- during its first
week of operation, reported Vice
President for Student Affairs Rich-
ard Woodring.

small but oil-rich neighbor Aug. 2,
life became uncertain for both
students and their schools.

Soon after, President Bush sent
40,000 U.S. Troops to Saudi Ara-
bia to defend against a possible
Iraqui invasion of that country.

Originally Pentagon officials
thought only 100,000 soldiers
would be needed, but raised the
figure to 250,000 a week later.

On Aug. 22, Bush said he
would activate 40,000 reservists to
support and replace the troops he
had already sent to the Persian
Gulf region. It was the first time
reservists had been called to active

“duty since the Tet Offensive in
Vietnam in 1968.

Suddenly campuses were

f6rced to ponder a significant

number of students and staffers -

leaving mid-semester to serve.
Course sections could lose their
instructors, School finances could
be disrupted if fewer students were
around to pay tuition and dorm
fees.

Students themselves could |

have their studies interrupted, with-
out a guarrantee of being able to
resume them when they return to
civillian life.

Although there is a federal law
that protects the jobs of workers
who are called to duty, there is no
law protecting students, Hanley
said.

To ease uncertainty among
student reservists, Purdue Univer-
sitypublished a detailed letter as-
suring students they would get their
fees refunded and earn a certain
amount of credit, depending on
when they withdraw.

“The department of personnel
services was getting a lot of calls,
and student services was getting
calls as well,” said Tim Newton,
an editor for Purdue’s news serv-
ice.

Newton said the school didn’t
know how many ofits students are
reservists.

“T think it’s a pretty small per-
centage,” Newton said,. “At this
point we don’t know.”

Whatever the number, the fi-
nancial impacton campuses proba-
bly would be minimal, added John
Huie, Purdue’s Vice abe geen for
state relations.

If students were missing from
school when the state surveys the

~ campus to determine its appropria-

tion, “it could potentially have a
modest impact” on state funding.

However, Huie added, “any
change inenrollment doesn’tshow
up, (in terms of fu sing), for two
years. We’re not talking about a
sufficient number of students “ to
cause funding problems.

Smaller schools said they will
deal with the situation on a case-
by-case basis.

If any (students) were-called

make their re-entry after serving

said Edward Macias, provost at
Washington University in Mis-
souri.

Meanwhile the student reserv-
ists and their families try to pre-
pare for what may lie ahead.

Andy Wilson, a senior politi-
cal science major at Purdue and a
student reservist, “wouldn’t hesi-
tate at all if a call went out.”

However, while Wilson would
have no reegrets about leaving.
school, he admitted it would be
hard to leave Kathleen , his wife of
a month and a half.

Being married “doesn’t make
it any easier,” Wilson said.

Renssalaer’s Waldron, joined
the Army Reserves “more to pay
for college” than to fight a war.
When he enlisted, he didn’t think
he might be sent to battle.

However, Dean of Students
Eddie Knowles assured Waldron
he would get an automatic leave of
abscence if he is called to active
duty in the middle of the semester.

“If I get called, I can just pick
up where I left off,” Waldron said.
