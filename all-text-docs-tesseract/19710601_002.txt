The Governance Report

Written by. Trustee Dixon Phillips, Dean of the
University of North Carolina Law School, the gov-
ernance report at long last clarifies what was pre-
viously a tangled web of courts and jurisdictional com-
mittees. The lines of authority now are distinct as are

the lines of appeal.

The question as to whether the Dean of Stu-
dents’ can function as both a counselor and a dis-
cipliniarian is still to be decided. Although the trus-
tees included a section allowing the dean to dis-
qualify himself in certain situations, the burden re-
mains on the shoulders of Will Terry. Will’s perform-
ance in the past demonstrates his ability to juggle

these roles, but what hapeens

longer the dean?

when Will is no

The signifiance of this report, though, is that the
policy-making function of student conduct is now to
be shared by the students, faculty and administra-
tion on the Student Conduct Council. No longer does
the faculty have to bear the burden of student con-
duct. No longer will the faculty be damned by the
students for legislatmg a morality.

The burden now falls in large measure on the
shoulders of the students, who are equal in repre-
sentation with the faculty on the council. This is
a milestone in that this is the first time the students
have been equal with anybody on anything.

Rejoicing, however, will be only momentary. With
increased power comes increased responsibilitv. It is
important that the students demonstrate that they can
handle this power responsibly.

What makes this report a breath of fresh air in
the foul-smelling history of Davidson documents is
that a great deal of thought has been given to the pro-
tection of student’s rights. The rules are codified, and
the sanctions enumerated. That judicial proceedings
will not appear on academic records is also encourag-

ing

The governance committee now begins the ‘se-

cond phase of its work, that dealing with the re-

lations between the faculty, students, ad

nsistation

and trustees. Let’s hope the present attitude of the

trustees continues.

WHERE IS DAVIDSON GOING?

College Means Choosing Together

By HANSFORD EPES
Asst. Professor of German
Having been an accessory

to asking students to de-
scribe where Western civili-
zatian4s going. I can't very
well turn down responding
to the trivialization of the
question: Where is Davidson

going? .
Of course, the accom-
plished bull artist knows

that the question must be
answered by describing
where Davidson has been.
This shows off knowledge,
and also shows the pant of
the profile most clearly dis-
played by someone backing
into ‘an answer.

Nl avoid talking about
where Davidson has been. |
don’t reaiwy know; I’ve only
been here, off and on, for
14 years. That’s not a long
time.

If 14 years — or four —
aren't much in looking back-
ward, they aren't much in
looking forward either.

If you're going to ask
where Davidson is goimg, you
should be talking about a
long time. If we talk about
where Davidson will be
fonty years.,from now we
make a shaky assumption,
that there will BE a David-

son forty years from now.

I'm not sure we can assume
that.

After all: how much longer
is someone going to pay a
lot of money to be educated.
or polished, at a place in the
middle of nowhere which can
be of only limited service
to him — or, hopefully, to
ber?

Let's get rid of the as-
sumption, because it may be
a bad one. That gets rid of
the question, and replaces it
with new ones: who are we,
and where can we go?

Who are.we? We are a
Small liberal ‘arts college
which is located in the rural
South. That's one definition.

Another is that we are
something ike 1250 ‘people
who happen to come togeth-
er in ia common purpose,
though rarely with a com-
mon understanding as to
how to achieve it.

Or we are a name, and a
set of buildings, and many
people who have passed
through before us. And we
are ‘all of these things: in-
stitution, ‘and immediate
community, and forerunners.

Then again, it might be
helpful to say what we
aren’t. We aren’‘t large, or
urban; we can’t help you
pursue your researches to
the frontier.

We can't provide an ex-
periment near at hand for
every possible stretch of the

Davidson Still Lives In Past
Despite Innovative Change

To the Class of 1974:

You may remember thar
at the beginning of th:s past
school year. 1 spoke W you
at an assembly which was a
part of freshman orientation.
Now. the the veat whieh we
szarted together is over,

Do you remember whnt 1
said at that ume! The fob
lowing is a sammary of the
text of my commen.s:

“| want to welcome you to
Davidson — ‘a strange sort
of place in the country. A
place steeped in history,
drenched in Southern culture,
and washed over with a con-
servative heritage and a very
old tradition.

“Davidson is aiso a. piaec
in trouble, Caugh: in a dy-
namie and moving eime,; this
school still moves ai a snail's
pace.. The world looms a-
round it: the schooi is being
hemmed in.

“Th recent years. che story
of Davidson has become a
story of a tragedy. This col
lege has stowed t a stand.
suill. Whether this place will
come out from thai tragedy
is up to all of us — io you
and to me. and to ail ol
those associated with this
school.

“These are some of the
problems which | see before
us:

“1. Too many people ai
Davidson are hung-up im
archaic roles. Too many
people separate their aca-
demic self from. their per-
sonal self, and they tend

curiosity. A.J we can do is
hope to siretch that curiosny
so that it knows how to d.-
rect self and how to crit-
cize itself,

These are some of our
limits: they are geographi-
cal, they are financial, they
are inherent in tne decisian
to try to do some things well.

The limits should aiso pro-

vide possibilities: the possi-

bility to be an individual in
a tribe, a member of a
community with shared
totems. That is, in so many
words, the small - college
cliche — but if the words are
empty, then let’s give up.
The oppor:unity not to be
lost is the main advantage
we have. Notice: the oppor-
tunity, not the inevitability
you can get lost here, too.
But it's sort of your decision.
That is where I start worry-
ing about ‘“‘where we are go-
ing.’ The last few years
have.secn.an upsurge in the
use of language about com-
munity and cooperation. Too
much rhetoric, I suspect —
because. the reality hasn't
really matched it.
Community is possible only

with mutual trust. and we've .

got a lot of groups which
don't trust each other -- and
on occasion have pretty good
reasons not to.

No flow chart in the world

to hide their personal lives
from view: People could do
that 20 vears ago, but now,
its deadJy and damnable.

tp. This institution _ stilt
thrives on too many Tittle
Mickey Mouse and pedantic
pules. The institution is fro.
zon and inflexible. We see
a bnd case of what might be
calied institutional rigidity.

“3. The dorms must be
opened. There is no place for
antiquated morality in the
1970's,

“4. The Code of Responsi-

bty is an archaic doeu
men’ and 15 based on views
and valves of a fonmer gen-
cra ion, it sets up a potice
like State. on the campus
wth i)-s:naffge set of rules.
rega:ations, and punishments.
We should get rid of this
tertible document.
“3. Thre Church = reiation-
ship must go. For too long
this sehool has been a school
not for people, but for Pres-
by.crians. The Presbyier-.
ians don't contribute enough
to support this plaec, and we
would do better as a center
at: freedom and learning if
the church affiliation — is
dropped.

"6. The catalog is hypo-
critical and a farce. Many
illusions are put forth by
this College in that docu-
ment,

“7, ROTC must go. This
program ha§ _ traditionilly
been a program designcoa to
impose discipline on tfe
campus. Its goal is not to

produce that sense of
pulling together. No codes,
no constitutions, no gover-
nance committees cah force
into community a group of
people unconcerned for each
other and for the common
goals.

Somcimes. the image [
naye of Davidson ‘is of a
gnoap calling itself a com-
mune, but in whieh mo one
is willing to wash the dish-
(S$, Or cook the food, or touch

One oi my vices is that I
ike words — a vice whose
pleasures 1 recommend to
everyone. ‘College’ is a
word. It means, losely.
“choosing together."'

Look at both parts of the
meaning. “‘Chosing:” to ac-
cept some things and deny
others, but to do it yourself
— and maybe freedom is
the..right to limit yourself.

“Together:"’ to exercise
that freedom wish a genuine
regard for what'you do for
others. .

We can talk: about where
we are going when we can
get together about where we
are and why we. are tkavel-
ing with each other.

And we aren't going! any
where until we: find agree-
ment on that question.

can

seck peaee. bul to. prepare
people for war. lt is a dan-
gerous program.

"8. Generally, the place is
just no: wery exciting. The
college is too structured. too
formal. and many of its
ideas are too old and cum-
hersome. No one around
here seems very interested
in doing anything about it,
and apathy reigns.

“As for suggestions for
this coming year, | hope
you will realize several

ihings. This is not like high
school. You don’t have to
wait until your senior year
to do something to change
your school so that it méets
your needs, and you don’t
need to wail any time at all

to be somebody. It’s time
for you to get involved
NOW.

“Reach out to the people.

next to you. Get to know
everyone here as well as you
ean. Become personally in-
volved in others, and be sure.
to begin to become aware,
aware of who you are, your-
self, There is nothing more
important than responding to
people and becoming aware
or yourself.

“Join together with your
fricnds 10 press for changes
that will make this school
the besi school you can im-
agine. You must remem-
ber that Davidson will move

only as fast as you push: #..

“You may have a hard
time here trying to be your-
self, to say what you really
feel, to bcome the person
you want to be. But don’t
give up trying to make your
personal life a good one, for
that may be the most im-
portant thing you will) do
here.

“-y will always be interested
in wha. yor are doing. 1
want 10 get to Imow cach of
von .veny, wetl, and 1 hope
tha you will get to know me.

“F nally. L want to remind
you that Davidson is a pro
duet. of the past and suiill
fives in the past much of the
ume. You may become frus-
trated ip your work here.
but always know that what
you are able to do to bring
Davidson to the present will

benefit this place in the
future. .
You bring great talent,

skill, and some spontaneity
to this place. Let’s hope that.

your stay at Davidson will ..

stimulate this school in. new
ways.’

I think you will now see, .:

after a year at Davidson,
that the school still dives in
the past in many ways.
There have been some chan-

ges at Davidson in the pasl:~

ue

year which are worthy of:

some praise, but it will be
up to, all of us next year to

seek for those central chan-:

ges which will bring David-

1971.

As ‘long as: Davidson re-':
tains its old ideas, students‘ ’

son to where it should be for

here will be wasting ‘heir’

time, and once time is spent,
it is hopelessly lost.
