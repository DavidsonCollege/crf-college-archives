Joining Maloy on this
year’s squad are UCLA's
Lew Alcindor, LSU's ‘*Pistol"’
Pete Maravich, and another
area star, Charlie Scott of
North Carolina.

So far this season, Maloy

has scored at a 23.8 rate
while averaging about 14
rebounds a game. He is con-
sidered to be one of the best
all-around players in college
today.

Several coaches who have

Often called’ by his team
mates ‘‘stick'’’ or sometimes
“fat man,"’ his slight build
would seem to make it hard
to withstand the punishment
of rebounding. But a set of

Frank to grab an average of
eight rebounds a game.

Basketball in high school
was particularly gratifying in
as much as he won All-Coun-
ty honors two years and
gained the MVP award in

year.

Having to make the transi-.

utes his success to his
coaches. ‘“My coaches were

are just a few of the many problems facing the inter

What happens to the high school stars that come to
Davidson to play in a minor sport? What needs to be
done to alleviate the dismal seasons that several of the

These questions and others that arise will be explained

FROM THE

BENCH

By
ROCKY CROSSWHITE

The Game To Watch

Watching people and their reactions to certain
situations has always seemed very interesting to me
This is not to say that the late TV program “Candid
Camera,” was one of my favorites, but try observing
the spectators sitting around you at our next game
if you can pry your eyes from the court action for
a few minutes

Sitting on the bench, | have come to regard specta
tor-watching as a game just like the sport they come to
see. Not only do the bench boys have a good seat to
watch the action on the court, we can also observe
what is happening in most areas of the coliseum. At
times the action off the court tends to be more inter-
esting than what we sit there to watch

The upper reaches of the domed building in Char-
lotte are usually occupied by either high schoo) couples
or last minute ticket buyers. The former group could
care less about the action on the court while the latter
group seems to search the rest of the coliseum for
better seats. This upper group disappears from sight
in the second half of our games when a thick cloud
of smoke forms as it always does. I never thought about
it before but I guess likewise, we can’t be seen either

Moving down the aisle, you find the balcony and
mezannine sections which are occupied by many season
ticket holders and their families. It is from this sec-
tion that most of the young tykes who ask us for our
autographs originate. Many of these people are long-
time Davidson. fans for some reason or another and
they can recall stories of past teams which would take
three days to tell

These people are the funniest to watch when Da-
vidson is playing sloppy as on occasion we do. They
start shaking their heads and leaning down the row
to tell someone else how Fred Hetzel. and his gang
never looked this bad. These fans live and die with
the outcome of our games and I'm sure they set up
some of our starting players as examples for their
sons.

Immediately below are the box seats where the
soft and comfortable spectator’s life can be purchased:
The individual padded chairs provide an ideal posi-
tion to view a game. These fans even have better
chairs than the skin team.

Across from us in the box seats sit different mem-
bers of the administration and faculty. 1 am not sure
whether all the professors are given soft seats here
but I know President Spencer, Dean Johnston, and
others reside in these preferred thrones..Maybe only
the department heads get chairs in the box seats be-

cause of tenure or something élse, but whatever it is.
these people sit throughout the game making sure
they clap and stand up at the right times

Across on the other side, the box seats hold the
wealthier Davidson alumni who help support the bas-
ketball program. This group of fans are quite vocal
and are continually yelling down helpful hints to
Lefty and the players. The girls swoon over’ Wayne
Huckel when the men marvel at Maloy’s latest move

On the floor, in the end zones and the parquet
are the students and their dates: These are mainly the
people we watch when sitting on the bench. There's
always a good show going on on one side or the other

The girls brought in as dates are the most humor
ous to watch. A certain percentage sit and yawn, all
the time watehing the clock, while others are contin-
ually jumping up and down yelling at the refs and
players

Every once in a while a girl sitting on the front
row who has been very vocal will c atch you staring
at her. She will then sort of put on_an embarassed
smile, subconsciously pull down her skirt, and whisper
something to her date. We all laugh, sink lower in
our chairs, and watch the game.

Swimmers Face Difficult Task
In Tourney After Wake Loss

By ALEX GORDON
“ Sports Writer
“We're going to have to do
a lot better to get anybody
to qualify,"’ declared David
son swimming coach Tom
Stevens.

This statement reflects
Coach Stevens’ thoughts both
on the upcoming Southern
Conference Swimming
Championships and the sea-
son as a whole.

All season the squad has
been fighting lack of man.
power and poor conditioning.
However, after losing their
first two meets badly, they
came up with five straight
wins, all against schools
with swimming programs
comparable to Davidson's.

Tuesday Coach Stevens
saw his squad's five-meet
winning streak shattered by
Wake Forest, 60-44.

“They could have beaten
us worse than they did,”
mourned Stevens.

Only seven of the nine
swimmers on the squad were
able to make the trip to
Winston- Salem, and, as
Ceach Stevens noted, ‘seven
is not enough." In fact the
Wildcats started the meet by
being forced to forfeit the
400 yard medley relay.

“It was the worst we have
swum all year. Our times
were terrible," revealed
Coach Stevens.

Coach Stevens actually
felt that the only bright spot

in the meet was John Corin-
in’s third place finish in the
200 yard individual medley,
an event which was new to
him.

The Wildcats managed to
take only four first places.
Jim Newton, although hamp-
ered by a chest cold, took
the 100 yard freestyle and
swam a leg in the 400 yard
freestyle relay.

Bill Woodson was also a
double winner as he captur
ed the 500 yard freestyle and
swam in the 400 yard free-
style relay. Jack Steele and
Mac Davis rounded out the
400 yard freestyle relay
team. Jim Winn took the
butterfly.

*‘We swam really well un-
til Tuesday. The whole squad
did not swim as well as it
could,”’ observed Coach Stev-
ens.

The loss was especially
dissappointing since it came
right on the heels of an ex-
citing victory Friday over
The Citadel. After seven e
vents in the meet, the Wild-
cats were down 24.37. Yet
they came back to win
55-49 by virtue of a victory
in the 400 yard freestyle
relay, the last event of the
meet.

Steele again captured three
victories. He won the 200
and 500 yard freestyles and
swam on the 400 yard free-
style relay team with New-
ton, Woodson, and Davis.

pionships on’ March 6-8 go,
Coach Stevens is not very
optimistic. He points out that
East Carolina will easily
come out winner, with VMI
and William and Mary fol
lowing way behind.

Newton won the 100 yard
freestyle, Woodson took the
1000 yard freestyle, and Davis
captured the 50 yard free-
style. John Cronin won the
victory in his specialty, the
200 yard backstroke.

The Wildcats have two
meets remaining, against
VMI and Duke, in the regu
lar season, and Coach Stev

Coach Stevens sums up his
feelings about the conference
championships in the follow-
ing way: ‘‘In order for us to

IMAC Handball
Tourney Begins

It's five down and six
to go in the IMAC handball
tournament.

Already the ATOs, KAs,
Pi Kapps, Machis, and Betas
have been eliminated due to
two losses.

And come next Wednes
day, only one team, the
champion, will be left. At
least four teams seem to
have a chance for it.

The Kappa Sigs, defending
champions, appear to have
the best chance. Led by

Scott Cutting and William
Brown, the Sigs have swept
past their first opponents
into the semifinals of the
winners’ bracket.

However, the Delts, Snus.
and Pikas all appear to be
in the running, too

So far forfeits have domin.
ated the tournament. Of the
advancements thus far, only
four have been by way of
victories on the court, Eight
have come about when one
of the teams failed to show
up.
