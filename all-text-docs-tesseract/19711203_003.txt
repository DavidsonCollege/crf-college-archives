SGA By-Law Revisions Proposed

AN ANALYSIS

By TOM BRUCE
Steff Writer

The latest attempt to revive
the SGA by-laws could have a
telling effect on the future of
the Residence Hall Association
(RHA), and the election of
campus officials.

If passed by the Senate, these
by-laws would also give increas-
ed power to student body mem-
bers who will be able to serve
greater numbers on SGA com-
mittees as well as overturn Sen-
ate action with greater ease
than in the past.

The effect of the new guide-
lines will also be to reduce the
amount of obsolete verbage in
the by-laws and to abandon
some of the old rules that ‘‘pro-
moted inflexibility," according

Bookbinder Dazzies
As Bandolero Hero

A REVIEW
By TODD HOBBIE

Bandolero or Why Rosco Book-
binder Is a Good Boy begins in
Valverde Texas in 1867 and goes
down hill from there.

Raquel Welch is her usual
silicone self in this movie and
no doubt her ace writers were

quite pleased with the lines they |

produced for her. She plays the
part of a woman who was ‘‘a
whore at thirteen” and whose
“family of twelve never went
hungry.” She is also a Mexican
who finally gets back to her
native Mexico after such a long
time away, or as she puts it,
“This is the first time I have
been in my country since I left.”

Raquel is not the central char-
acter in this drama of the Old
West. She is definitely over-
shadowed by whoever it is who
plays Rosco Bookbinder, a young
man shot through the waterbag
wiping out his chances of ever
saying ‘I rode all over Mexico
with July Johnson.”

George Kennedy and James
Stewart are OK in Bandolero,
and sometimes one finds him-
self wondering when _ things
were so hard up for them that
they took this movie.

Dean Martin is cast way over
his head in Bandolero. One
wonders if he ever gets over
Raquel’s penetrating question,
‘How does a man become an
animal like you?’ The -question
is asked at the first of the
movie and Martin seems to be
in a fog for the duration.

Bandolero is not all bad, how-
ever. The color is by Delux and
there is some mean Jew's harp
music which seems to reach
out of the Morrison Room
speaker system and grab for
your very soul.

I really guess I should stop.
I wouldn't want to ruin the show
by telling you too much about
it. I’ve already given all the
best parts and for that I apol-
ogize.

Bandolero is definitely a good
movie to see an a Tuesday night
when all you. have to do is
study. It seems like a person
could find better things to do
on a weekend, though.

to Bill Ralston, Chairman of the
Constitution committee.

The most major change seems
to be that the new by-laws do
not specifically designate the
SGA Vice President as presi-
dent of the Residence Hall Asso-
ciation. Ralston stated that this
move was intended to define the
positions of SGA President and
Vice President a little more
closely and to bridge the way
for a separation of the legisla-
tive and executive branches of
student government.

Ralston said that he person-
ally favored a plan that would
“test the RHA by fire.’’ He

said that under the new guide-
lines, the assembly would either
succeed or collapse.

The new by-laws will also
widen the field of candidates
for various campus Offices if
passed. The old by-laws speci-
fied that the SGA vice presi-
dent be a member of the rising
junior class, but the new by-
laws allow for a rising sopho-
more to run for the office. The
SGA President and editors of
THE DAVIDSONIAN, the Quips
and Cranks, and the Miscellany
however will still be drawn
from the rising senior class.

Furthermore, YMCA offices

which were formerly pigeon-
holed in explicit classes will now
be open to and voted on by
the entire student body.

The new by-laws will also not
designate exact meeting dates
of various boards and councils
but will leave these decisions
to appropriate student officials.

Provision was made for the
Seating of two new voting rep-
resentatives in the Senate, sel-

ected among the residents of
Gray House and the off cam-
pus students.

The new rules will also al-

low proxy voting in the Senate
under certain specialized cir-
cumstances. Proxies will not be
accepted if candidates are nom-
inated from the floor in an elec-
tion, for instance, since the
proxy would not reflect the full
voting slate.

Another substantial change
that the new by-laws would af
fect is the conducting of refer-
endums. At present a two-thirds
majority of the entire student
body is required to overturn a
senate action. In the future a
two-thirds majority of those
voting would be sufficient to
pass a referendum.
