Davidson sends acceptances for Oass of 91

By SUSAN PEARSALL

Now that the Admissions Of-
fice has completed its list of ac-
cepted applicants for the Class of
1991, the usual wild speculation
about the new freshmen has begun
on campus. To help alleviate
some of the tension produced by
such speculation, The Davidso-
nian has chosen to publish a pro-
file of the acceptees, the fortunate
thirty percent of.2,012 applicants.

Of these 605 students, 362 are |
males, and 243 are females. The
median composite SAT score for
the accepted students was 1270,
while this year’s freshman class
had a median score of 1230. Their
median ACT score was 29, while
this year’s freshmen’s median
score was 28. The median class
rank of the accepted students is in
the top five percent.

It is interesting to note that .
females had higher Verbal scores
(620) than males (600), but that
males had higher Math scores
(670) than females (650). The
mean ACT scores were slightly

higher for females (28 to 27.8),
and the mean class rank for males
was 11th to the females’ 6th. Only
twelve students had ACT scores in
the 31433 range, but 89 of them
werd in the top one percent of their
graduating classes, 68 in the top
two percent. Twelve students had
Verbal SAT scores in the 750-800
range, sixty-three had scores in
the 700-740 range, and 117 had
scores in the 650-690 range. forty:
two of them had Math scores in
the 750-780 range, 147 in the 700-
740, and 149 in the 650-690
range.

As far as géographical distri-
bution is concerned, more stu-
dents were accepted from the At-

‘lanta area than from any other .

metropolitan area; while forty-
two come from Atlanta, forty are
from Charlotte. While there has
been a general trend toward a
greater concentration of Atlantans
at Davidson, admissions directors
were still surprised that Atlanta
had surpassed Charlotte as a
supplier of students. One possible

explanation, according to Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid
James Hendrix, is that there may
be more alumni living in Atlanta
who are helping to spark local in-
terest in Davidson.

All in all, 186 students were
accepted from North Carolina, 65
from Georgia, 54 from Florida, 41
from So.ith Carolina, 38 from Vir-
ginia, :'4 from Tennessee, 23
from Te cas, and 22 from New Jer-

sey. Three foreign students were
also accepted — one each from
Japan, Kenya, and Switzerland.
The final listing of all accepted
students will be posted by the Ad-
missions Office today at 3:00.

Davidson student and professor visit Central America

By NELLE McCORKLE

A Central American fact-find-
ing trip organized by Mecklen-
burg Presbytery included a David-
son student, professor, and two
local residents.

The group spent two weeks in
Costa Rica, Guatemala, and
~ Nicaragua, returning Wednesday
night. “The purpose was to
broaden our understanding of the
issues in Central America, to
study the role of the churches in
Central America in light of the
political situation . . . with the
intention that we could come back
and share our perceptions with
people in churches and com-
munities here,” according to Reli-
gion Professor David Kaylor.

Participants visited the United
Nicaraguan opposition headquar-.
ters, the U.S. Embassy in Man-
agua and met a delegate of Latin

America’s only cardinal, Nicara-_

guan Cardinal Obando y Bravo.

None of the four Davidson
participants had visited Central
America before this trip. Asked if
the region were as he expected,
Kaylor said, “The material condi-

tions in Nicaragua were worse
than Iexpected . . . . The suffer-
ing of the Indian population in
Guatemala was worse than I an-
ticipated, because there’e no way
you can anticipate that.”

One particular visit which af-
fected junior Jody Hart involved
the group’s tour of a Managuan
hospital. Hart said, “I met a
Nicaraguan government soldier
who had stepped on an anti-tank
mine on a road in the northern part
of the country. The mine had been
placed by contra forces. He had
his right leg and his right arm
blown off and one of his eyes so
damaged it had to be replaced with
a glass eye. I would estimate he
was my age. I guess it stood out in
my mind because he wasn’t even
in battle, and he was my own age,
and I saw and felt and I guess ex-
perienced for that one moment the

plement his independent study of
liberation theology’s political as-
pects conducted under Political
Science Professor Brian Shaw.

Shaw and Kaylor plan to teach
“Religion and Politics in Central
America” during Winter Term
1987-88. Kaylor said, “I’m explo-
ring the possibility of enabling
students to go on a similar trip
next year.”

Visiting Central America
strengthened, but did not change
Kaylor’s views of America’s role
there. Kaylor said, “My opinions
remain pretty much as they had
been, that the U.S. needs to play a
different role in Central America
than it has played in the past. I
think supporting the contras, for
example, is a morally bankrupt
policy, and I’m more than ever
convinced of it, because we are

pain he had felt, and I couldn't
help but feel sorry my government
was responsible for it.”

Hart, a political science
major, did not receive academic

_ credit for making the trip, but

noted that the experience will sup-

among the Nicaraguans.”
Kaylor and Hart emphasized

_ the diversity of opinion they en-

countered. Kaylor spoke to an op-
position party member

Nicaragua’s parliament, the As-
sembly. Despite disapproval of

of °

government policies, this parlia-
ment’ ‘member maintained that
U.S. support increased Soviet ten-
dencies within the Sandinista gov-
ernment, Kaylor said.

Central American govern-
ments permit religious freedom,
Kaylor said. He noted govern-
ment expulsion of two Nicaraguan
priests, one for possession of con-
tra weapons and the other for ad-
vocacy of U.S. aid to contras. The
Catholic Church has dismissed 35
priests for Nicaraguan political
activity. “Most seem to think
there is enough religious freedom.
One could question where religi-
ous freedom is most in danger,
from the church or the govern-
ment,” Kaylor said.

The Nicaraguan Catholic
hierarchy maintains close govern-

He cited Obando y Bravo's claim
that the revolution increased re-
ligious repression. The Cardinal’ s
accusation contrasts with remarks
made by other clergy: “We spoke
with several Catholic priests and

Protestant leaders who were very

sympathetic with the revolu-
tion... . They felt the Nicara-
guan people had benefitted from
the revolution. They felt that they
are able to carry on their work
without interference,” Kaylor
said. .

Nicaraguans appeared curious
about potential escalated conflict,
Kaylor said. “There’s real con-
cer in Nicaragua that the war
games’ joint military manuevers
by U.S. and Honduran troops with
Honduras in April and May will
become an invasion. The war
games tend to increase the hostil-
ity in the region.”

“Geographic and cultural sep-
aration can distort Americans’
view of Central America,” Hart
said. “A lot of the facts and the _
way the situation is presented to us

causing __enormous___suffering__ment_associations,—_Kaylor—said———overlooks the-human-side-of Cen-—

tral American society,” he said.
“With all the reading and studying
Thad done I was at a real distance,
and [visiting] brought to my con-
sciousness a sense of desperation
and urgency that I had not had be-
fore.” a :
