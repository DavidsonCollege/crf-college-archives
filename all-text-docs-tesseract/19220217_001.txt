Columbia Seminary Quartette and
Speakers Spend Week-End on Hill

Music Furnished at Chapel, Movies, Church, Volunteer Band, Ministerial

Band and “Y”—Searching Talks Made.

During the past week-end Davidson had as her guests the Columbia
Seminary Quartette, composed of Messrs. Belk, Barber, Batchelor and

Yandell, assisted by Messrs. Hay an! Beatty.

The majority “of these

men visited Davidson last year, making a profound impression upon the
students both by their songs and by their speeches, and it was with the
greatest of pleasure that they were welcome back this year.

The quartette, recognized as one of
the best college quartettes in the South,
furnished music at the chapel exercises
Saturday, at the movies Saturday night,
at the church services Sunday morning,
at the Ministerial Band meeting Sun-
day aftenoon, and at the “Y” meeting
Sunday night. z

While on the Hill these men, mingled
and talked with the Davidsonians-and
came to be known by the entire student
body. Their songs were heard from
time to time during the day, wherever
a request was made, but even above this
they will be remembered as the Colum-
bia Seminary men who stand for clean,
moral, righteous living.

The-entire party seemed to be per-
fectly at home while on the campus and
were loud in their praise of the Davidson
spirit and morale.

.A short sketch of each of the young
men is given below.

George W. Belk, Jr., of Henderson-
ville, N. C., attended Presbyterian Col-
lege for three years. He is a well-known
athlete and played against Davidson in
football, baseball and basketball. He
made All-State in each of these sports.
He is now taking his A.B. and M.A, at
the University of South Carolina. He
sings first tenor in the quartette. This
is his second year at the Seminary.

Ernest L. Barber, of Columbia, S. C,,
is a graduate of Westminster Prep
School and of P. C,, finishing at the lat-
ter institution in 1919. He is now a Se+
nior at the Seminary and fills the pulpit
of a church in Edgefield, S. C. He sings
baritone in the quartette.

Alex. R. Batchelor, of Geneva, N. Y.,
studied agriculture at Cornell and is a
graduate of the Pittsburgh Bible School.
After finishing at the latter school he
picked out Columbia Seminary as the
place to secure his B.D. degree. He is
an active Student Volunteer and sings
lead in the quartette.

B. Frank Yandell graduated from Da-
vidson with the class of '13. He later
graduated from Moody Bible School. He
supplies at the Wilmore Church, in Char-
lotte. He sings bass in the quartette.

Sam B. Hay, of Allendale, S. C., gradu-
ated from Davidson in ’16. During the
war he served with the Navy. After se-
curing his discharge he held a position

Greater Davidson Club is
Getting Into Trim to Work

Plans for Getting Full Number of
Best Men Possible Made.

The Greater Davidson Club held its
first meeting of the year on last Monday
morning in Shearer Hall. Extensive
plans were laid for the coming year,
which, if matured, will far surpass any
in the history of Davidson,

Dr. J. M. McConnell opened the meet-
ing with a short history of the club and
its work during the last few years. He
told how it was organized four years ago
with the purpose of perpetuating the
ideals and traditions of Davidson and of
propagating them throughout the length
and breadth of the country. The slogan
adopted at that time was, “A Bigger and
Better Davidson,” and since then the
entire student body and alumni have
been working with this sole aim in view
and the fruits of their labors can be
readily seen. Two years ago the goal of
the club was set at five hundred stu-
dents, and the mark has been attained.
Last year three-fourths of the new men
who registered were those who had de-
cided to enter Davidson through the ac-
tivities of the Greater Davidson Club.

The mark set by the club was reached
last year. For the coming year a new
slogan has been adopted, “Five Hundred
Again but Quality First.” The present
rooming capacity of Davidson does not
permit of an increase in numbers, but
next year’s Freshman class is to be a
selected group. Only those men are to
be chosen who are capable of lifting high
the ideals of the college and who can
reach the scholastic and moral standard
set. by former student bodies.

Dr. McConnell cited several high
tributes which were recently paid to the
institution by prominent men who are
in no way connected with the college and
it can be readily seen from the few facts
given above that the Greater Davidson
Club is reaping a great harvest.

Mr. F. L. Jackson next gave, in a icw
short sentences, the plans which have
been made to meet the loss of Chambers.
A contract for a new concrete, fire-proof
dormitory has been let and it will be
ready for occupancy next September.
This’ building is to be four stories high
and will furnish rooming space for 180
men. It will be situated on dormitory
row just next to Georgia. A new central
heating plant is also to be erected. On
the 22d of this month the trustees will
meet to discuss funds for several more
improvements.

The meeting was brought to a close
with a few pointed words from Sam
Story and Walter Knox, which voiced
the sentiment of the entire student body
and expressed its determination to make
the coming year the best in the history
of Davidson.

SEMINARY MEN MAKE STRONG
TALKS AT THE “Y” SERVICE

The query reads:

The “Y” vesper service last Sunday was
conducted by five students from Colum-
bia Theological Seminary. Messrs. G.
W. Belk and A. R. Batchelor gave strong,
convincing talks on the subject of com-
plete consecration to Christ. About
ninety per cent of the students were
present.

Mr. Belk plead the cause of Christ just
as if he were a judge, the audience the
jury, and Christ on trial. His talk was
based on Roman's 12:1, “I beseech you
therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
God, that ye present your bodies a living
sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service.”

Christ, to whom all belongs, can take
anything except our sefvice, which must
be given of our own volition. He asks not
only for our hands or our lips, but our
all as living sacrifices. =

Christ was the most perfect man who
ever lived. Yet, from a’ broken heart,
caused by our sins, the most perfect man
of history completely. gave way under
the burden of the cross and died as aj
propitiation for our sins. The terrible
agony that comes through death from a
broken heart is inconceivable. Still.
Christ underwent that for us, and in re-
turn for His sacrifice He only asks that
He be permitted to be ‘the dominant
power in our lives.

The speaker was not trying to force

surrender to His will. No limit can be
placed on the value of a surrendered
life. Christ gave Himself for you. What
will you give for Him?
