Looking at Her
Facebook Profile

Senior Reid Schneider was casu-
ally surfing Facebook before class.
Julie Simmons was scoping the

-boy scene at the library computers.

In an awkward alignment of
voyuerism, each caught the other
simultaneously, and they haven’t
made eye contact since.

Stationed in the library’s glassed
-in “fishbowl” computer lab,
Schneider noticed that one of his
fraternity brothers had written on
the wall of a freshman girl.

“My first thought was, bold bro,
bold,” he said. “I’d never heard of
this dolphin, but her thumbnail
looked pretty smoking, so I had to
check it out.”

Julie Simmons is enthralled by her
creepy facebook stalker.

According to several eyewitness-
es, Schneider didn’t just “check
out” Julie Simmons’s Facebook
profile.

“He was balls deep in that page,”
onlooker Nelson Schwab said.
“Full-on lean-in, mouthing her
interests and activities, nodding his
head, grinning. This dude was all-
world creepball.”

The worst part about it? Julie
Simmons was sitting right next to
him, and until she realized he was
facebook stalking her, she was
checking him out with oogling, las-
civioius eyes. Then she changed her
mind.

“He was totally sketchy,” she
said, “like Jack-the-Ripper mixed
with Christian Slater. I can tell my
own profile from the corner of my
eye, so I noticed immediately.

“But I didn’t say anything until
he lingered on a picture from my
senior beach week. I watched him
for maybe five minutes.

“T noticed he is left-handed, near-
sighted and has a tattoo of the
Endless Summer poster on his
upper back.

“I found out that he lives in
Jamieson 201, room D. He has 342
facebook friends at Davidson. I
watched him watch me, and, you
know, I got this weird satisfaction
from it. I thought about following
him home.

“Then, after I had surveyed him
for a while, I told him what a creep-
er he was for Facebook stalking

”

A | Girl Looks at Guy Nintendo

Nintendo salesman and long-time
loser Bruce Halloway now refers
to himself in the “royal wii.”

After a record-breaking sales
quarter for Nintendo Wii distribu-
tor Bruce Halloway, his family has
been forced to accomodate a
Bowser-size ego that Mr. Halloway
has never before possessed in his
somewhat mediocre 43-year-old
life.

“He used to have to ask me to
twist the cap of the container of
jelly because he was both physical-
ly and mentally too weak to open
it,’ Sheila, his wife, commented.
“Now he just throws the jelly con-
tainer on the floor, and, as it shat-
ters, he yells, “VICTORIOUS!””

One night at dinner, Mr.
Halloway told his family he was
immortal and therefore would
henceforth be referred to as “The
Wiiternal One.”

But his family complains that the
most disturbing change of all is
that Mr. Halloway now only speaks
to his family using “The Royal
Wii.”

“Dad took us to Home Depot last
week and declared that “Wii need-
ed four screws to repair our remote
control airplane.’ When we tried to
tell him it sounded stupid because
it was only his plane, he yelled,
‘SILENCE, THE WIITERNAL
ONE HAS SPOKEN!!” ;

Apparently an outing to
Bennigan’s last week also ended in
tragedy as Mr. Halloway declared:
“Wii would like a quarter-pound
cheeseburger wiith a milkshake,
NOW.”

His son, Bobby, who is lactose-
intolerant, was forced to drink the
milkshake and subsequently had
stomach cramps for the remainder
of the night.

Mr. Halloway uses The Royal
Wii to speak for himself and his
family at soccer games, cocktail
parties and, most recently at par-
ent-teacher conferences. As he
says, “Wii’re showiing no sign of
slowiing down.”

Davidson Town Police Cars More

Effective than Davidson Town Police

Officer Chase Pickle has only made one arrest in three years, but his

empty patrol car slows down dozens of speeding drivers every day.

According to a recent survey by
a Charlotte consulting firm,
Davidson Town police cars are
more effective, diligent and hard-
working than Davidson Town
police.

The Department’s fleet consists
of 10 robust, well-oiled Crown
Victorias, each equipped with a
many-horsepower V-8 engine, a
radar gun, two drink holders and a
fancy gizmo that detects radar gun
detectors.

The Davidson Town Police,
however, is staffed by three trained
officers, one secretary and a three-
legged Rotweiler with a nonfunc-

tional olfactory nerve.

“Our cars are so good, some
days I don’t even go to work,” offi-
cer Chase Pickle said. “But don’t
you folks worry, our empty cruisers
are keeping Davidson’s streets
even safer than occupied cars
would.”

Empty police cars, it is estimat-
ed, reduce average traffic speed by
6.75 miles per hour. Bloated police
officers, ironically enough, play
three games of Miami Vice per
hour. But together, as the officers
are proud to say, they constitue the
third most effective police force in
the tri-county area.

Salesman Uses Royal Wii

Sober-free Housing
Not So Successful

A semester-end report by the
Residence Life Office (RLO) indi-
cates that the highly anticipated
sober-free housing option that was
available to select students this past
fall semester has failed miserably.

To address the concerns of stu-
dents not comfortable with sub-
free housing, campus leaders
joined together this past summer
and created a new alternative in an
attempt to give all students an
appropriate living option.

“Sometimes I feel like there’s
just too much pressure to not drink
on campus and instead do some-
thing worthwhile with my life. It
got to the point where I didn’t real-
ly have any options to drink on the
weekend. I needed a lifestyle
change,” Sammy Barlow reflected.

This change came in the form of
a few run-down shacks constructed
from plywood and aluminum on
the outskirts of the cross-country
trails.

“We didn’t want to put them near
anything with architectural integri-
ty on the route of campus tours, so
this location seemed appropriate,”
Dean Pandley commented.

Members signed an agreement
stating that they would not drink
Gatorade or Vitamin water, but
instead would strictly follow a diet
of Crown Royale and Busch Light
while in the house. However, tem-
pers flared as no one could hold
coherent conversations and the
trash never got taken out except
when it blocked the path to the
fridge.

“It was a good idea,” junior Will
Torrins remarked, “but it looks like
all that lame pressure to go do
something culturally respectable
will return next fall-” ‘

Honor Code No Longer
Applies in Library

In a drastic move by the Honor
Council and the SGA, students will
now receive amnesty from the
school’s brutal honor code in the
E.H. Little Library.

SGA vice-president Taylor
Pierce remarked, “For some rea-
son, no one ever abiding by the
Honor Code there anyway.

“Besides, making it a free-for-all
location where books and ipods
can legally be stolen at any
moment is a great safeguard
against complacency.”

“For example, one vandal report-
edly rolled a copier outside and
load it into his pick-up truck. Now
the copiers are chained to the wall!

“I myself just had three plasma
TVs taken last Thursday. I was
annoyed at first, but it motivated

- me to go out and take someone’s

$85 textbook from their carrel the
following day!”
