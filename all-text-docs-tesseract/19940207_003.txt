Future of new
eating houses -
still up in the air
By Beth Lindsay

For a couple of weeks last se-
mester, loud promotional flyers for
a new co-ed eating house made
bold claims and covered every
dorm door and bathroom wall, but
talk of creating a new house died
away as quickly as it had come.

Supporters of thu new house

were left wondering why the two
separate proposals for new eating
houses on Patterson Court disap-
peared so quickly last semester.
Sophomore Samantha Hackett
says, “there was simply a lack of
interest” in a new eating house.
Yet there is still much talk about
continuing with plans for a co-ed
eating house.
Hackett and other organizers were
disheartened by the low turn-out
at a McKee House organizational
meeting held at the end of last
semester. McKee hoped to offer
an eating house option that “does it
better.” Proposed enticements in-
cluded catered food services, so-
cial theme parties and mixers, and
a self-selection option for men.

When asked about the prob-
lems with her effort, Hackett re-
sponds that organizers “were ham-
pered by the alternative stereotype
of the former co-ed eating house,
PAX.” She adds, “people are re-
ally scared of commitment and of
Starting something new. People
need to be willing to put their
money where their mouth is.”

Sophomore Allison Sabel ex-
perienced many of the same prob-
lems as Hackett in her attempts to
organize a second new house.
Sabel held several organizational
meetings to arouse interest in an-
other option for women on Patter-
son Court.

She hoped that the new house
would be smaller than the existing
women’s houses and planned to
provide nutritious food with veg-
etarian options. She found, how-
ever, that “people were afraid to
commit to something that they
weren’t sure about."

The task-of both groups of
organizers was made more diffi-.
cult by the fact: that two houses
were attempting to form at the same
time. The college agreed to, re-
model PAX as the location for a
new house if organizers could get
40 upperclassmen to commit to the
house financially and 20 freshmen
to self-select the house. The num-
bers were not there.

According to Sabel, interest
for the new women’s house has not
died: “There is still the need for
another house, and the interest is
there."

A strong core group aims to
continue to spread the idea of a co-
ed eating house on the court. Their
goal is to make use of the “friend
network” --publicizing their cause
via person-to-person conversation.

While the co-ed eating house
proposal is still in the planning
stages, the group feels very opti-
mistic that “there is more interest
than ever before." They would
like to try to reach independents
with meetings on freshman halls.

A skunk invaded the outside
heating system of an off-campus
home last week forcing the four
Davidson juniors who live there to
evacuate.

“We were skunked out of our
house,” explained one of the
house’s inhabitants, Rhen Otts.

Otts and her roommates,
Angie Williams, Shelly Baker, and
Amanda Lesesne, had been living
in t’.cir home only a week and a
half when they awoke early Satur-
day, January 29 to the smell of
skunk spray circulating through

their house via the heating vents.

According to Otts, “the smell
invaded everything in the house—
clothing, beds and sheets, and
school books.” She said that their
“cars smell justas bad as the house.”

Early in the week the women
began hearing complaints about
the skunk smell from neighbors.
By Tuesday, the women, whocould
tolerate the foul smell no more
than their neighbors, packed up
and moved to a hotel in Cornelius.

Before leaving, Otts and her
roommates attempted to lessen the
smell by placing fans, bowls of

Chlorox, and baking soda through-
out the house. They attempted to
rid their clothes of the smell by
washing them two or three times,
but their efforts were to no avail
explained Otts who has, “been in
the same clothes for a week.”

A Pest Control representative
placed traps in their yard to catch
the pesky skunk, and the women
hope to be back in their house by
the end of the week.

George Morris, Grounds Su-
pervisor for Davidson’s Physical
Plant, explained that Davidson,
with its numerous drain pipes, is a
suitable habitat for skunks.

The influx of skunks onto the
campus in the last few weeks can
be blamed on the warmer weather.
The animals, which were hibernat-
ing during the hard freeze in mid-
January, are now emerging to
search for food.

When the grounds crew re-

'-campus abode

ceives reports that there are a large
number of skunks inhabiting a par-
ticular area on campus, they at-
tempt to capture the skunks with
“Have a Heart” traps which do not
harm the animals. Captured skunks
are transported by Mecklenburg
Animal Control to uninhabited ar-
eas.

Morris advises students not to
act alarmed when they see a skunk
on campus. The chance that a
skunk will spray increases when it
feels threatened.

Morris notes that an encoun-
ter with a skunk is more likely to
occur at night, at dusk, or in the
early morning because skunks are
nocturnal animals. He reassures,
however, that “if you won’t bother
them, they won’t bother you.”

For those who are unfortunate
enough to be sprayed, Morris rec-
ommends a tomato juice bath as
the best remedy for the smell.

Junior Sara Withers speaks with Bhikkhu Dhammavihari.

Buddhist explains global faith

By Carrie Blackburn

Although many people envi-
sion the Buddha as a fat laughing
man found outside of Chinese res-
taurants, the Venerable Bhikkhu
Dhammavihari calls such an im-
age “ridiculous.”
: . Addressing a’ crowd on Feb-
ruary 2 as a part of the Dean Rusk
Program, the Buddhist monk lec-
tured on “Buddhist Spirituality

‘and the Global Community."

A bust of the Buddha and the
scent of incense in the 900 Room
enhanced the atmosphere as the
Bhikkhu spoke on the basic pre-
‘mises of Buddhism. Is Buddhism a
philosophy or a religion? UIti-
‘mately, he says, the label is irrel-
evant: “as long as love comes into
the community, the brand name
doesn’t matter.”

Buddhism, which Siddhartha
Guatuama, “the Enlightened One,"
discovered in 600 BCE, spread
from India, across Asia, and into
the Middle East. Followers car-
ried the message along the silk
route, reaching China in 50 CE.

The Bhikkhu attributes China
with contributing greatly to the
spread of Buddhism. He says that
in Asia, “you can still see the con-
tribution Buddhism has made to
enrich the lives of the people.” For
instance, in Japan the tea ceremony
and tradition of landscape garden-
ing emerged from Buddhist cer-
emonies.

One of the appealing themes
of the Buddha’s message is his

sex, age, race, or caste. The
Bhikkhu comments that he “has
been a guiding force of numerous
people, not one nationality or race.”

The Bhikkhu Dhammavihari
decided to become a Buddhist
monk after teaching Buddhism and
Pali (an Indian language) for over
60 years in both his native country
of Sri Lanka and at the University
of Toronto in Canada.

Hespent6 monthsin the jungle
studying with other monks. Ad-
hering to an extremely austere
lifestyle, the monks ventured into

the village only once a day with.
just a bowl in which to receive ©

their daily meal.

After his ordination in May
1990, the Bhikkhu slowly moved
back into the community to find a
receptive audience. He still be-
lieves strongly in the Zen Buddhist

practice of remaining close to na- -

ture and tries to return to the jungle
every couple of months.

The Bhikkhu serves as the
editor-in-chief of the Encyclope-
dia of Buddhism. His work, A
Correct Vision and a Life Sublime,
has received much acclaim. He
has residedin amonastery in Wash-
ington, D.C., since June. There he
serves as a teacher and a guide to
his Buddhist followers.

Dr. Mahony felt honored to
have this “world-renowned
scholar” speak to his Buddhist tra-
ditions class, and he feels that ”the
fact that he was here helps us to see

, that we're talking about:a real tra-

dition.”
