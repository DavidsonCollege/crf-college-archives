Randoiph-Macon
To Host Symposium

‘Individual Ideals and Social
Reality’’ will be the theme of
“Focus 1964,"" Randolph-Macon's
second annual symposium on the
American nation to be staged
March 6-8 at R-M Woman's Col-
lege.

The opening address will deal
with the individual's place in
society. A panel will discuss the
relation of public morals to leg-
islation.

The second panel, composed of
scientists, will discuss science
and ethics. Four panels will deal
with the role of a writer in so-
ciety, business ethics, twentieth
century religion, and news cen.
sorship.

Any students interested in at-
tending the symposium or in
gaining more information on it
should check with John Burks.

$100 For Tuition
Due On March 15

M. W. McGill. the college bur-
sar, has reminded students that
the $100 deposit on tuition for
the 1964-1965 fall semester is due
on or before March 15, 1964.

Every student except seniors
will receive an invoice from Mc-
Gill before the end of this month.

Each. one of the three rising
classes pay different rates for
tuition. The rising senior class
pays $700 per year, the rising
juniors pay $800 per year, and
rising sophomores pay $900 per
year.

The drama, “L‘Alouette,” is
the story of Joan of Arc, by one
of France's leading playwrights.
Jean Anouilh. For this produc-
tion by Le Treteau de Paris,
Anouilh even hand-picked the
cast, many of whom are famous
actors in the French theatre.

The troupe, partially subsidiz-
ed by the French government as
part of a cultural exchange, has
been playing on Améfican col-
lege campuses for several years.
With each tour its popularity and
schedule have expanded.

Already this year’ the group
has performed in many cities
from Miami to San Francisco.

Anouilh has chosen Luce Vin-
cent to play the leading role of
Joan. Pierre Le Rumeur has the
supporting part of the Inquisi-
tor. Both actors are among the
leading representatives of mod-
ern French drama.

According to the French De-
partment at Davidson, a large
audience should receive the pro-
duction here. Groups from sev-
eral high schools and colleges
in the area have already made
reservations. All second- and
third-year French students here
are reading the play.

Tickets from $1.50 up are still
available at the College Union.

Roberts

Roberts is in the Insurance
business in Charlotte, where
he has resided since 1931.
He is an ordained minister in
the Evangelical United
Brethren Church, which is
the thirteenth largest denom-
ination in America. He was
graduated from Indiana Cen-
tral College, which he de-
scribes as a church-related
schoo! about the size of Dav-

idson, affiliated with the
Evangelical Church.
Roberts has never had a

regular congregation to which
to speak, but he has done
some substitute and guest
preaching. He served as an
officer for the YMCA’s in
both Charlotte and Indianapo-
lis for a total of 11 years.

Roberts has a son who at-
tended The Citadel and a
daughter who went to Win-
throp. Asked if he would be in
favor of sending his grand-
children to Davidson, he said,
“Davidson College is no worse
off than a lot of schools that
are having the same trouble
as you. About the only thing

people can do if they send -

their kids to school fs to teach

them the Bible before they
leave home.’’)
Mankind today, including

many leaders of the visible pro-
fessing church of Jesus Christ,
is in rebellion against God. Such
people refuse to accept the fact
that this Age of Grace in which
we live is a fulfillment of past

March 14
New Date
ForMarch

The proposed civil rights
march from Johnson C. Smith
University to the post office
in Charlotte, formerly sched-
uled for March 2, has been
postponed, it was learned from
Joe Howell, Davidson  co-
ordinator for the march.

The march, now set for Sat-
urday afternoon, March 14,
will coincide more with the
time that Congress will be de-
bating the bill. The new date
also allows the marchers more
time for preparation and pro-
vides a more convenient time
for neighboring schools which
have afternoon classes.

The purpose of the march,
Howell reiterated, is “to show
that in general we favor strong
civil rights legistation.“ He
stated also, ‘Though we cer-
tainly favor passage of the
bill presently before Congress,
we do realize that there is a
probability for changes in it
as it now stands.”

Pointing out the fact that the
campus civil rights committee,
with professors Philip Secor,
Max E. Polley, and E. F. Pat-
terson as advisors, was in no
way connected with an official
campus organization, Howell
added, “We as_ individuals
simply feel that this is a time
fo express our beliefs in ac-
tlon.”’

Copies of the controversial
bill will be made available to
the student body within the
next two weeks.

SPRATT ON ELECTIONS:

In a sense, the elections changes for this year are a care-
fully contrived case of discrimination. Hopefully, the dabbling.
undependable student will be at a distinct disadvantage. And
hopefully, the new regulations will be a deterrent to those
who are vying for a nice rush week title or a glossy picture in
the annual or another statistic to fatten up their grad school

JOHN SPRATT

Notes on Election Changes

applications.

The Student Council has done more than to jettison a
few of the old encumbrances. It has tampered with the tender
philosophy that since everyone knows everyone at Davidson,
elections need only to be mild and passive balloting. We have
junked the old nominations system, fot instance, in favor of
a procedure that emphasizes individual initiative.

We are allowing written

statements of a candidate's

platform to be circulated in the interest of promoting those
candidates who have ideas and programs. We are requiring
that a candidate make a decision in offering for student body
office or honor court. We have compressed the elections period
into a smaller space of time in order to encourage greater

participation and discussion.

It is hoped that these changes will! favor the hard-working.
well-informed, resourceful candidate. There will probably
be men still elected to offices who care very little for the
responsibility and who are unwilling to fulfill the obligations.
of their position. Elections will probably also remain mild and

generally inhibited.

But the man who wants the job will have a better chance
than ever; the odds for the candidate who has ideas and

wants to implement them are

much improved. And who

knows? Maybe we can cut down on some of the driftwood that

floats in with every election.
