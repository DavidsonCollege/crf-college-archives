Buddy Morrow Plays
For Gala Midwinters

Buddy Morrow's popular orches-
tra will supply-the music for the
Davidson Midwinters Dances which
begin a week from tonight. The
weekend will get under way with
a formal dance from 9 until 1 on
Friday, February 18.

Trombonist Morrow, who fea-
tures glamorous Dorothy Kae as
vocalist, will present a concert Sat-
urday afternoon in Chambers Audi-
torium. The events of the week-
end will be rounded out Saturday
night with an informal dance from
8 until 12.

Two years ago when Morrow
played for the Homecoming activ-
ities, he pleased his audiences
with his renditions of “Night
Train,” “One Mint Julep” and “That
Old Black Magic.” Since that time,
his orchestra has played at col-
leges throughout the country, in-
cluding Cornell, Princeton and
Vanderbilt.

The orchestra leader’s musical
@areer has included experience
with Paul Whiteman, Artie Shaw,
Eddie Duchin, Vincent Lopez, and
the Dorsey brothers. His early
triumphs in the musical world in-
cluded his recording of “Rose,
Rose I Love You,” which hit the
top of every best-seller list across
the country. This record helped
boost his young group into the
position of one of the top bands
in the nation.

One of the reasons for Buddy
Morrow's extraordinary success as
a bandman is his policy of “play-
ing the type of music the public
wants to hear.” He is currently
recording for Mercury Records.

Ted Andrae, chairman of the
decoration committee for the
dances, has stated the decorations
will center around a specific
theme. Plans have been made to
begin decorating the gymnasium
early next week.

Independents, alumni and others
who wish to bny tickets to the
dances can purchase them from
any Interfraternity Council repre-
sentative.

Dublin Players’ To Give
Two Plays Feb. 25, 26

By DUNBAR OGDEN

The Dublin Players will give
two performances here on Feb-
ruary 25th and 26th in conjunction
with the Davidson College Artist
Series. “Unparalleled,” said one
critic of this troupe which is to
give Noel Coward’s famous “Blithe
Spirit” at 8:15 p.m., Friday in
Chambers Auditorium. Saturday,

the 26th, at 3 p.m., The Dublin] try

Players will perform “Juno and
the Paycock” by one of Ireland's
finest ‘playwrights, Sean O’Casey.

The Dublin Players was original-
ly formed by Ronald Ibbs in 1947
under the name of the Ronald Ibbs
Company. It has come to be made
up of the outstanding actors from
Ireland’s famous Abbey and Gate
Theatres. Previous to 1947, Mr.
Ibbs had for nine years been lead-
ing man at the Gate Theatre in
the Earl of Longford’s Company.

After two years of playing in
Ireland, including a controversial
production of “Hamlet” in modern
dress, Eric Bentley, critic, author
and dramatist, persuaded Mr. Ibbs

to take the company to America
to tour under the auspicies of the
International Theatre Exchange.
Ibbs divided the company into two
units, one of which was to tour
America under the title of The
Dublin Players, directed by Mau-
reen Halligan, his wife.

The original tour of this coun-
was so successful that The
Dublin Players are now making an
extended tour to encompass more
than one hundred major cities of
the United States and Canada.

Playing with great skill and
style, characteristic of these two
classic Irish Theatre, The Dublin
Players have given new meaning
to the masterpieces of the modern
drama by such men as Bernard
Shaw, Oscar Wilde, J. M. Synge,
and Ibsen. “. . . the finest company
to come to this country in twenty
years,” said Ed Sullivan of them,
and/ Variety, the trade paper of the
theatre, rated the group as “top
entertainment.”

Phi Installs President;|Gehring Returns
Elects New Members/ To Davidson Campus

The Philanthropic Literary
Soicety met Monday night, Feb. 7,
1935, for the inauguration of the
new officers.

Stein Wilson, outgoing president,
expressed his appreciation to the
members for their cooperation and
support during his term of office.

Malcolm. Williamson, the new
president of Phi, delivered his
inaugural address in which he em-
phasized the importance of Phi in
developing the intellectual facul-
ties of a man and how inseparable
the literary society and liberal arts
college are in developing the com-
plete, as well as the scholarly man.

The business consisted of the
election of new members. An hon-
orary membership was extended to
President Eisenhower, who was
considered for this honor because
of the high caliber of his speeches
and public writings, which have
contributed so much good to the
society in which we live.

William Henry Harrison was the
last president to become a mem-
ber of Phi.

Professor Philip Gehring re-
turned to Davidson last week after
a semester’s leave of absence to
complete work on his master’s de-
gree in the field of music, which
he obtained at the University of
Syracuse. He studied under Arthur
Poister, who was also his instruc-
tor at Oberlin where he received
his bachelor of music degree in
1952, Professor Gehring resumed
his duties as college organist Jan-
uary 30 when he played for the
Vespers service.

Mrs. Gehring, who was at the
same time working for her mas-
ter’s degree in musicology, has re-
mained in New York where she
will play the lead in the Katchet-
urian Violin Concerto with the
University of Syracuse Symphony
Orchestra this month. She is vio-
lin teacher at Davidson.

During Mr. Gehring'’s absence,
Mr. John T. Fesperman of Cataw-
ba College filled the position of
college organist. Mr. Fesperman
has returned to Catawba College

‘where he is Professor of Organ.

FIRST PROGRAM ON

CAMPUS

U.C.M. Termed Success

Davidson College's first visit by
the University Christian Mission,
jointly sponsored by the YMCA
and the National Council of
Churches of Christ in the U.S.A.,
formally ended Thursday evening
with the celebration of the Lord’s
Supper at. the College Church. For
a great many students, the dis
cussions centering around the prob-
lem of “The Mature Christian in
a Changing South” have stimulated
their thinking, promising for the
future a keener appreciation of
the forces and changes acting upon
the South and each individual's
participation in these transmis-
sions.

Under the chairmanship of Dr.
John Bevan and vice-chairmanship
of Jason McManus and Cortez
Cooper, the campus committee met
each morning for breakfast with
the mission team to examine the
campus’ response to the previous
day’s activities. Every possible ap-

mittee in planning the program
to provoke thought and the ex-
change of ideas among the stu-
dents and faculty of the college
and the team: chapel talks, class
discussions, afternoon, seminars,
evening bull sessions, and personal
conferences.

The concensus of the committee
was that the five-day Mission pro-
gram was highly successful in its
purpose—"“To examine what our
response to the love of God in
Christ means, what social impera-
tives and claims upon our culture
that response involves, and what
each of us can do as Christians to
transform culture in the name and
nature of Jesus Christ”—and in its
objectives—“to present an ade
quate interpretation of the re-
sponse of the Christian faith to
racial tensions in the South, eco-
nomic problems in the South, the
South as a member of the world
community, and the role of the

proach was utilized by the com-| Christian in politics.”

Chambers wiil rock to the music
of Louis “Satchmo” Armstrong this
coming Monday evening, Feb. 14,
at 8:15 o'clock, as the incompara-
ble “Satchmo” and his trumpet
make an appearance similar to the
one which had Davidson students
ranting and raving last spring.

Louis brings, in his all-star
troupe, a group of jazz men each
of whom is notable in his own
right. Trummy Young is the fea-
tured trombonist, Barney Bigard
clarinetist, with Billy Kyle at the
piano, and Barrett Deems and
Arvel Shaw at the drums and bass,
respectively.

Velma Middleton returns and
will have the auditorium rocking
before long, a fact to which will
be attested by anyone who saw
her perform last year. The sight
of her clowning on the stage is
worth, by itself, the price of a
cket. She and uis make a
world-shaking pair, a better-known
modern musical pair being perhaps
only Rodgers and Hammerstein.

Louis is noted for his hometown
type New Orleans jazz and is a
“natural” as a musician as well
as a showman. He plays without
written arrangements and has had
the acclaim of all, even the “long-
hair” critics for as long as many
of us can remember. This two-hour
“Valentine” will be a tremendous
show and should have jazz en-
thusiasts up in the clouds for sev-
eral days.

Tickets for this performance
have sold very well, but there are
still some remaining. They are
priced at $2.00 and are available
to students from any LF.C. repre-
sentative.

Freshman Car-Owning
Privileges Suspended,

Effective Next Yeor

Freshmen will not. be allowed
to keep automobiles on the campus
next year, as a result of a ruling
by the faculty this week.

The problem of student-owned
cars has been the subject of much
discussion in recent months by
the faculty. .

Dean Spencer pointed out that
many other colleges forbid stu-
dents to have cars at all and that
those that do permit them usually
have strict regulations.

One of the principal reasons for
the faculty's ruling was the com-
plaints received from parents over
freshman ownership of automo-
biles.

Eu Society Initiates
Thirty-Six Members

The Eumanean Society met on
Monday night, February 7, 1955,
and 36 new members were added
to the roll.

The meeting was called to order
by President Tommy Dove, who
appointed Messrs. Crouse and
Marshall as committee chairmen
for “Phi-Eu Day,” which is to be
held in the near future.

Joe Conarroe outlined to the
new members the process of writ-
ing papers. Jim Batten re-read a
paper which he wrote and
presented before the society his
freshman year. Maurice Crouse
read his new creation, “Telling the
Bees,” which received favorable
comment.

As an opening to the invitation,
Mr. Dove gave an historical sketch
of the society. The new initiates
then signed the roll book and of-
ficially became new members.

The following were initiated:
Harry Heinitsh, John Bernhardt,
Andy Hamilton, Dan Woods, Ken
Forester, Grant Sharp, Fred Hayes,
John Shaw, Ross Smyth, Tony
Guiles, Bob Oliver, Peter Eller,

Dave Brubeck Quartet |
In Concert Here Soon

By BILL

id

“They'll flip for this far-out
jazz,” is the considered opinion of
the Interfraternity Council which
has loosed the scoop that Dave
Brubeck’s Quartet will soon rock
the Davidson campus with the
coolest of its renowned reportoire.

Brubeck, now atop the roster
of modern jazzists, has agreed to
add Davidson as his final appear-
ance, following Duke and UNC,

;Jon this short Southern tour. The
S}IFC has inked March 10 at 8:15
as the date for this production.

Jazz is currently enjoying the
greatest surge of popularity in its
history, The West Coast has be-
come the country’s most avid pa-
tron of jazz of the “cool school”
which has originated as a reaction
to the “hot school,” a blatant, but
essentially simple, musical in-
terpretation epitomized in Dixie-
land.

Dave, a son of northern Calli-
fornia, is a product of this,
America’s newest center of synco-
pation. He has long evinced an
inquisitive musical talent by his
deviations from the recognized
piano curriculum.

As a student at the College of
the Pacific, Brubeck proved him-
self a true Bohemian by retreat-
ing to a cellar “bomb shelter,”
along with his roommates, to main-
tain a continual jam session. Fol-
lowing an army special services
enlistment, he studied under
France’s Darius Milhaud from
whom he mastered the art of im-
provisation of jazz.

In 1981 Dave organized a quar-
tet, soon developed his own re-
cording company, Fantasy, and has
now won acclaim in capturing the
popularity polls of “Down Beat”
and “Metronome” trade magazines.
Since then he has been shuttling

Faculty Group Makes
Chapel Changes

The faculty voted this week to
limit secular presentations in as-
sembly to Wednesday and to make
the Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
meetings exclusively worship serv-
ices approximately 15 minutes in
length.

The move is designed to increase
the spiritual value obtained from
the worship services and is a re-
sult of the feculty’s endeavor to
improve the overall chapel pro-

gram.

Wednesday services will hence-
forth be called ‘convocations” and
will include various types of pro-
grams, including lectures and
music recitals,

Important announcements will
be allowed following the service
on chapel days.

The ruling will probably not
be effective until next year since
this semester’s schedule has al-
ready been completed.

Simplified Regulations
Effective This Semester

Effective immediately, a new system of absence regula-

son students. Cuts already taken this semester will be counted
under the new system. Fundamental differences include the
distinction between academic and non-academic college

Revised Constitution
Goes fo Student Body

The revised constitution of the
Student Government of Davidson
College was presented today to
the entire student body for inspee-
tion and ratification. Perrin Ander-
son and his committee have la-
bored dilligently since September
in order to overhaul the present
Constitution.

In revitalizing the present Con-
stitution, Anderson and his com-
mittee studied the Constitutions of
Princeton University, University
of Virginia, and Washington and
Lee University. From the Consti-
tutions of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity and Princeton University,
the basic organization of our
Constitution was molded. The
Faculty Committee has already
passed the new revised Constitu-
tion; and, after and if the student
body ratifies it, the whole faculty
will have an opportunity to pass
judgment.

The revised Constitution has
been logically and pertinently re-
worded in various places, enabling
the reader to understand more
clearly the meaning of the dif-
ferent articles. For instance,
Article DI was doctored in this

evolved into a series of fantastic] manner. Article MI provides the

most glaring example of this type

point and polytonality but bearing|o¢ revision, but in other places

no semblance of the old standard
from which each rendition derives
little but fts title. “Stardust,” as
played by Brubeck and his group,
retains nothing of the original
except the mood.

The essence of this “cool” jazz,
as differentiated from “hot,” is the
tension between order and im-
provisation which grabs the audi-
ence, holding it in a spell as the
performer “invents” his selection.
It is in this impromptu composing
that Brubeck reaches his state of
trance which is to him an hypnotic
ecstasy which he terms “breaking
through.”

words and phrases have been like-
wise altered.

Completely new additions com-
prise the second manner of re-
vision. Article IV, Section 3, calls
for candidates for office “to sub-
mit a written statement” signify-
ing their “willingness to run” and
adherence to the “regulations gov-
erning elections.” Article VI, Sec-
tion 2, adds to the previous oath
for office an explicit clause com-
pelling the officers to be “honor
bound to report violations of the
Honor System and other provisions
of the Constitution.” Under Article

exercises, and the division, for the
purposes of application of regu-
lations, of the student body into
underclassmen and upperclassmen.

Important differences from the
old regulations include the num-
ber of cuts allowed students and
the penalties for overcutting
classes. Henceforth, every student,
regardless of his years in college,
will be permitted one unexcused
absence for each semester hour in
the course. The major penalty for
excess absences in any course will
be loss of all quality points earned
in that course.

In addition, significant revisions
were made concerning the number
‘of absences permitted in vespers,
chapel and convocation, and physi-
cal training.

Termed as a type of “personal
responsibility” system, the new
set of rules came as a result of
recommendations by a _ special
faculty committee in conjunction
with the Student-Faculty Commit-
tee.

The new set of absence regula-
tions reads as follows:

L
A. All students are expected to
attend classes and other required
college exercises regularly.
B. Excused absences will ordi-
narily be granted for:

1. College
participation.
2. Tiness as certified by the
college physician.

3. Death or critical iliness in
the immediate family.

4. Weddings in which a mem-
ber of the immediate family is
a principal.

When possible, the student
should obtain permission for
such absences before they oc-
eur, but in any case he must
present his request to the Dean
within a week after the occurrence.

C. A student who for any
reason is absent from more than
25% of the scheduled meetings
of any class will receive no credit
