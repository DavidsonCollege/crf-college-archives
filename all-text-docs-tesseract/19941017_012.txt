Stasack spends time exploring the music of the East

by Geordie Schimmel

Remember those burning
questions from childhood about
Korean music? Professor Jennifer
Stasack answered them all last
Monday evening ina beautiful lec-
ture and recital in the Visual Arts

Center.

Stasack, who has recently re-
turned from South Korea, was
awarded several grants to further
her composition work in Seoul.
While abroad she studied numer-
ous musical forms, butamong these

the most fascinating is Pansori.
Pansori singers must com-
mand a considerable vocal range,
and in training will retreat into the
mountains, singing from
mountainpeaks until heard far be-
low, or will go into waterfall caves,

singing against the back of the
falling water. But, lest you be rhis-
led, Pansori is not all vocal. A sort
of sleepy sideways harp called the
Kayageum or a barrell drum is
sometimes played in accompani-
ment-and the effect is impressive.

When the exquisitely honed sing- ©
ing meets harp and drum the sound
i$ [very] unlike anything you have
ever heard. The music becomes a
yin and yang, moving between ten-
sion and release, tension and re-
lease — always evocative and deep.

Fiction writer Mark Richard:

Southern writer reveals simple Truths about humanity

By William Robert

“Start with a simple thing and
just open it up.” Mark Richard
gave this advice to a gathering of
students and professors at a read-
ing of his fiction held last Wednes-
day in the 900 Room. In fact, this
is exactly what Richard is a master
of and what makes the content of
his prose simultaneously rich and
unpretentious.

Richard, currently a visiting
professor of writing at Ole Miss,
stressed his maxim of keeping
things simple as he explained that
the story he read, “Gentleman’s
Agreement,” is about “a boy and a
rock, and that’s pretty much it.”
But through this elemental premise,
he was able to reveal things about
the world and the individuals who
live init. i

“Gentleman’s Agreement”
centers around the “covenant” a
child makes with his father after
throwing a rock and breaking the

windshield of the family car. The
child’s intentions are completely
innocent and noble when he real-
izes that the other rocks are jealous
and that they want to be “tossed” —
which is different from being
“thrown,” and therefore does not
break the covenant. Eventually,
the child attempts to toss arock too
large for tossing, and the rock splits
the child’s head open. After his
head is stitched and his father re-
turns from the hospital after being
severely burned while fighting a
fire, the two have a surprise en-
counter in the story’s final words.

The style in which this un-
complicated plot is delivered adds
the richness characteristic of
Richard’s prose. His insight into
the mind of the child is wonderful;
the child’s thoughts and actions
are both realistic and realistically
depicted, which makes them not
only credible but humorous. For
example, the naive notion that in-

* classics:

animate objects have emotions and
the description of the child poking
at the rock with his feet are both
common occurrences in the world
of children.

Richard’s text is also charged
by his frequent use of poetic allit-
erations, religious symbols, and
magical descriptions of natural oc-
currences: he describes the fire the-
father fights as “a mad dog
fire...barking.” Also, the charac-
ters in the story have no names
which makes them more universal
and more believable at the same
time.

When asked about his fiction,
Richard said that in writing, “It’s

_not the agenda; it’s the people”

that matter. He encouraged young
writers both to “write what you
don’t know because it’s a discov-
ery process” and to read literary
“as a writer, you want to
know where you are on the con-
tinuum.”

Made to look beautifully:

told me about the star-and-moon
affair I'd picked out. “So you want
to be a little kid, I’m gonna treat
you like a little kid.” He giggled. I
wasn’t sure what that meant. _
Pm gonna open up my own
place someday. Not photography |
like this—real photography, pto-,
fessional photography,” hetold me.
“Look pouty,” he commanded
when I had on the red sequined

cowboy jacket. From time to time °
he’d shake his head and make a_ ,

“tsk tsk” sound, as if I looked dan-
gerous in my outfits. After we
finished it was time to choose a
pose from the video monitor. It
was tough to decide between the

cowgirl look and the biker look, °

but I settled upon the leather jacket
with the turned up collar. I won-
dered if I looked like I was getting
ready to hop on a Harley, big hair
and all.

While I waited for him to print
outa proof sheet, I browsed through
other people’s Glamour Shots. A
photo album proudly listed the ages

_ of the women in the pictures— the
general trend being that they could

make 16-year-olds look like 30,

and vice versa. The stylist told me
that'men often give their wives or
girlfriends a sitting for a gift.
Women like to surprise their men
by presenting them with a slick 8 x
10 for their offices. I did Glamour
Shots out of curiosity for this ar-
ticle— it’s not something I would
ever do normally.

Before I left, a mother came in
tugging a little girl, no older than
six or seven. The girl was beauti-
ful—long, curly strawberry-blonde
hair, wearing cute little overalls.

Her mom went through the rack of
clothing for kids, picking out small
frilly blouses and the same se-
quined vest I’d tried on. The kid
looked as if she really didn’t un-
derstand why she was there. While
I watched, they sat her in the
stylist’s chair and began to put
makeup on her. She was very quiet
and didn’t smile at all. I wondered
what Glamour Shots could do fora
six-year-old that school pictures
couldn’t. Granted, dressing up isa
lot of fun, especially when you’ re
young; But to have it sanctioned
by your mother? To put such a
premium on beauty at a young age
might be harmful.

It’s hard to decide what to
make of this phenomenon. Glam-
our Shots are extremely popular—

dangerous

they were booked up a week in
advance. A sitting only costs ten
dollars, but the actual pictures start
at 30. It would seem strange to
someone from another culture to
see how we shell out lots of money
to pretend to be someone else for a
while. It can make you feel pam-
pered, tohave people spending two
hours slaving over your appear-
ance, making you beautiful for the
camera. With Glamour Shots you
can“be somebody you are not in
reality— a mild-mannered student
by day, diva showgirl by night.
After all, with the lofty status ac-
corded to models in our society,
who wouldn’t want to try to look
like one? On a mass level, that
says a lot.

He believes that his fiction
appeals to readers because of its
universal descriptions about the
human character. He justified this
by saying, “We’re all going to
throw rocks...let that be the human

leneone who cares"

thing.” Indeed, it seems that there
is something distinctively human
about Mark Richard, his fiction,
and the relationship of the two—
and perhaps that is what makes all
three so marvelous.

Dear Terry,

There is a guy in one of my
classes who is always touching
himself. I don’t think he cares if
people notice, because he winked
at me the other day. I want to tell
him I have a boyfriend, but I also
don’t want to have any contact
with him atall. I don’t know what
to do, but this touchy-feeley busi-
ness is getting way out of hand.
Please help.

Signed,

Rubbed the Wrong Way

Dear Rubbed the Wrong Way,

I believe you may be jump-
ing to conclusions by assuming
that he is interested in you merely
because he winked at you. Weare
talking about a person who touches
themself in public—an obvious
pervert. He may just be trying to
get a reaction out of you.

You should give him one.

tion women are compensating for
their insecurity and sexual inad-
equacy. None of them actually
expect aresponse. By sitting there
like a prim duck you are making
yourself a prime target. What you
need to do to combat his
harrassment is to scare him.
Next.time he winks at you,
wink back and smile invitingly.
Next time he touches himself for
you to notice, touch yourself, too.
Let him know that you think his
forwardness is incredibly sexy.

Most men who ogle and proposi- —

You might even want to go the
extra mile and begin to come on
tohim without provocation, When
you walk into class, drop your
pen in front of his desk and then
bend down slowly to retrieve it.
Smile at him, and snarl like a she-
wolf,

If his offensive actions per-
sist, you may want to resort to
something drastic. Go up to him
after class and say, “Hey, big guy.
I’ve noticed that you have been
sending me signals, and I just
wanted you to know that I find
you very attractive. I think it was
your delicacy and exuberance at
first that turned my head, but now
it is something deeper—a feeling
that rises from my insides, a feel-
ing I can’t put into words. If you
are not doing anything right now,
could we go to my room, because
I don’t think I can stand it any
longer.”

If this does not send him run-
ning away with his perverted little
tail between his legs, nothing will.

You will want to be careful,
though, about people overhear-
ing you. You would not want to
ruin your reputation (remember
image!). And let me know how
my method works. I’m having it
published ina psychological jour-
nal next month, and am really
curious to know if I guessed right.

Love,
Terry

Stories provide insight in
to the lives of others

on arpilleras, a form of folk art that
emerged in Chile in 1975.
Arpilleras are colorful scraps of
cloth that are arranged to tell a
story. After many men protesting
bad working conditions and the
lack of free speech simply disap-
peared, their mothers began creat-
ing the arpilleras as a means of
income and an avenue for expres-
sion’of their grief.

Marjorie Agosin has written
the first book on the subject, and
her presentation proves to be in-

formative as well as provoking.
Davidsonis also privileged to have
an exhibit of arpilleras from
Agosin’s private collection in the
Wilson Room. The exhibitis spon-
sored by the Union Gallery com-
mittee.
