I would like to do is to dispel the illusion under which
most Americans live. It is not difficult to obtain a place

t Oxford or Cambridge.

The reason why it is difficult
{for Americans to go there to
study is the different type of
education they received in this
country.

ln England we specialize in
one subject — science, langu-
age, and so on — from about
the age of fifteen years.

Education in England is com-
pulsory between the ages of
five and fifteen, and the child
may be sent by his parents to
either a Public (or State School),
or a private school.

The local authorities are re-
sponsible for the provision of
adequate public schools. Nine-

“There was this Negro with
a big gold tooth. and we dug
him up and took him over to

“A couple of days later they
had him all stripped down

victim s relatives and they made
the college bury him again. “I
think they sued the college for

BODY-SNATCHING

Most, of their body-snatching
seemed to go unnoticed. except
for one night when their Negro
driver. was surreptitiously deliv-
ering a corpse from the ceme-
tery to the Medical Building.

As he drove past some men
on the road, they saw the body
in the moonlight slumped in the
back of the buggy. Thinking
quickly. the driver turned to
the corpse, gave ‘it a firm shake,
and shouted for all to hear,
“Come on and sit up now!
You're not THAT drunk!” The

“I was running against this

‘Dr. W. J, Martin said to me,
‘Thompson. you've got the big-

man." '

His college days were a half
century ago, but he sfill likes
to talk about them.

LIKED CHEMISTRY

Thompson said. that although
chemistry was his favorite sub-
ject. he liked French, Latin, and
Greek. He graduated in 1904
with a,Bachelor of Arts degree
by making a high score on the
rigid. A.B. exam shortly before
commencement.

“I've never regretted not be-

ing a doctor.” he stated flatly. ,

“T’'ve made just as much money
as they do.”

A charter member of the Dav-

Students initiated Tuesday
were as follows:

children attend free _ schools
maintained by public funds.

Primary education from
five to eleven is taught to
boys and girls together but
after that age most schools
are for boys or girls, but not
for both together.

At the age of eleven these
children move on to one of
several types of secondary
school courses, having taken a
most important public exami-
nation which can decide the life
work of the child.

If he fails this text he is more
than likely committed to some
manual job after his secondary
education; if he passes, he has
the opportunity of going to Uni-
versity after going to Gram-
mar school.

The private or ‘Public’
schools, as they are called, the
“national heritage of Eng-
land,” are onty for the few
who can afford to pay the
equivalent of $1100 each year
for the education.

This may seem very little to
some Amerticans, but it is a sub-
stantial part of an Englishman's
income.

Boys .who go to these schools
do not: live in luxury but have
to contend with deplorable
conditions in archaic buildings.

These schools find it diffi-
cult to contend with the
Grammar schools which are
being built today, and which
give the student a good edu-
cation, but which do not build
up the qualities of the stu-

dent as in the “Public”
schools.

Bob Rea has been selected as
the chairman of the 1960 YMCA
Christmas Gift Fund Project,
Jimmy Richardson, ¥Y President,
announced this week.

Rea and a committee of five
assistants are presently study-
ing material from about 15 or-
ganizations in search of suit-
able projects to present to the
student body for acceptance.

Within the next week, they
will narrow their suggestions
to three. These three proposals
will be presented to the student
body through chapel programs
jin early December.

Aiding Rea in the program
are Al Jones, Joe Eifort, Kookie
iKapoor, Bert Keller and Tom
Patrick.

Last year, the student body
raised funds for new operating
room equipment to be used in
the Bangkok Christian Hospital
in Thailand.

Rea urged that the Student
Community begin thinking

about the coming financial drive
for the Christmas project, and
stated, “This is the time when
we students need to consider
‘our table of. vatues and sacrifice
something for ourselves so that
,we can give to those: who are
not as fortunate as we.”

Zeroing in on the future

At Gen Tel, our aim is to develop the supercommunica-
tions. system that will be needed to meet the demands
of tomcrrow. And we're constantly shooting new ideas
at this target.

In our 24 research laboratories, more than 3500 scien-
tists and engineers have their sights set on entirely
riew concepts in order to achieve these results.

Example: a task force of General Telephone & Elec-
tronics scientists, working in the unexplored areas of
eiectroluminescence and photoconductivity, have
Geveloped an operating model of a switching device
with no moving parts, that may revolutionize telephone
communications. It is a thin wafer only 3 inches square
that may someday connect and disconnect up to
10,000 telephone lines.

Meanwhile, this new discovery holds promise of having
numerous applicetions in other fields, including switch-
ing and read-out devices tor electronic computers.

Research is but one of the mary areas in which General
