Davidson
Be Mice Kus

DANVILLE, Ky. — A 15-
play, 90-yard touchdown drive late
in the fourth quarter proved too
little too late, as Davidson fell to 1-
8 with a 21-6 loss at the hands of
the Centre Colonels on Saturday.

FOOTBALL

After an opening-week win

drops 8th straight

over Sewanee, the struggling Wild-
cats have now dropped eight
straight.

Heading into their last colle-

giate contest this Saturday at 1:30
p.m. versus Bridgewater at
Richardson Field, senior captains
James Cassidy and Bo
Bartholomew, both with 11 tack-
les and a sack, and Will Robinson
(7 tackles and a sack) anchored the
defense in one of its best outings of
the season.

With the exception of two
quick, back-breaking touchdowns
in the first seven minutes of the
second half, the defense pitched a

shutout.

Along with dheinonbeesodis
panions, they effectively contained
touted Colonel tailback Kris
Garrett, who has rushed for a thou-
sand yards in all four of his college
seasons. :

Garrett picked up 127 yards
on the ground, actually a sub-par
effort for the powerful runner, and
his only score came on a 14-yard

screen pass from quarterback :

Jonathan Pruitt.

' The quality effort went for
naught though, as the Wildcat of-
fense could muster but 175 yards,
more than half of which came on
that last drive.

An athletic Clif Henry
scrambled 18 yards with 25 ticks
left averted a third shutout loss for
Davidson.

Centre defensive lineman Matt
Chambers returned a Dan Jonas
fumble 10 yards on Davidson’s
first offensive play of the game,
accounting for Centre’s other tally
and the only scoring in the first 30
minutes.

Hoping to establish their of-
fense from the get-go in the second
stanza, Davidson instead gave up
two swift strikes, essentially end-
ing any hopes of victory.

SPECIALTY SHOPS ON THE PARK, CHARLOTTE

And the entire team clicked
together in a way that made reach-
ing the goal so much easier. Amy
Kanoff had an excellent weekend
with two goals and two assists,
setting up many offensive chances
off free kicks and set plays. Lucia
Plosser, who was doubtful all week
with an injury, came out and helped

lead an offensive effort that over-
whelmed the Eagles and Paladins.

Inthe back, Lowrance was the
clear leader of the defense, scram-
bling and knocking away almost
every loose ball in the Davidson
end of the field, despite feeling the
effects of a separated shoulder she
suffered a couple weeks ago. In the
net, Allison Noznesky, who led
the league in goals-against-aver-
age, played solidly again, making
big saves when necessary.

But in the midst of the all the ‘

hugs, some tears and the camera-
toting parents and friends after the

' game, the talk once again turned

back to beating Furman to stake an
honest claim as the best team in the
conference.

“I wanted to play them to-
day,” Hundley said. “If we were
going to claim we won. this title,
we knew we had to beat the regu-
lar-season champion. ... Icouldn’t
have asked us to play and to dem-
onstrate how good we can play any
better than we did this weekend.”

Clarke buried into the back of the
net.

However, Northington usually
takes penalty kicks for Davidson,
but Clarke said he was “100 per-
cent sure” he was going to score
and asked to take this one. “He
(Northington) can take all the rest
of.them this year, but I wanted that
one,” Clarke said. Northington had
a different reason for letting Clarke
take what proved to be the game-
winning shot.

“{Furman’s] coach [Doug
Allison] was at the game Friday [a
first round 6-1 victory over the
Citadel in which Northington
scored a goal on a penalty kick],

|< and he knew which way I would

go. He [Pascale] did in fact dive
that way,” Northington said.

After the 6-1 win over the
Citadel on Friday, Davidson up-
ended Georgia Southern 2-0 in the
semi-finals on Saturday evening at
Richardson field. The semi-final
game was marked by fouls, and
according to Slagle did not win the
‘Cats any “style points”.

“This is a tournament,”

Deegan said after the win over
Georgia Southern. “It may not have
been the prettiest game, but you
have to do what it takes to win. We
played as a team today and got the
result. That’s all that matters.”

Slagle used different line-ups
throughout the tournament, start-
ing Julien, who spent most of the
season at striker, at outside mid-
fielder in the first round game and
giving him significant minutes
there in the semi-final.

John Eckman, a senior mid-
fielder, and Isaac Stewart, a junior
sweeper, were held out of the win
over the Citadel due to nagging
ankle injuries, and the Wildcats
were also without Ian O’Brien, a
senior mid-fielder, who was in-
jured against South Carolina in the
second to last game of the season.

In addition, Davidson used a
three forward line-up for much of
the final to put more pressure on
the Furman back line, playing

Then I didn’t do much for a while,
but I got two assists in the Citadel
game, and it looks like it was the
right move,” Kleeman said.

Slagle said they wanted three
people up front because Furman
plays four people on their back
line, and three strikers would get
Davidson more one-on-one oppor-
tunities.

“We had moved Keith up ear-
lier in the year, and this week in
practice Coach Colenstein sug-
gested that we work with three
forwards. I was a little nervous
because we hadn’t got to practice it
much since Tuesday because of
the bad weather, but we used it
Friday against Citadel after we got
up, but that was nothing like what
we did today. Today we played our
normal game with it,” Slagle said.

The win avenged a2-1 regular
season overtime loss to Furman at
Richardson field, and gave the

Kleeman, who had played
mid-field the entire season, was
moved to forward for the regular
season game against Appalachian
State to help fill a hole left by
Julien’s injury, which the sopho-

didn’t like it, but it worked in the

“This was the first time we
really came together,” Troiano said.
“You could tell how close we were,
and that we had come together as a
team. That has been our biggest
obstacle, but things are just start-
ing to click. We have had some
people that were injured and now
they’re healthy and we’re happy
about it.”
