Outsourcing hits Davidson

IBM, Dell, Microsoft, Davidson
College. What do these organizations
have in common? All four are among
the growing number of institutions
that “outsource” various jobs within
their corporate structure overseas.

This past Thursday, George Will-
iams III, head of the Davidson Col-
lege Board of Trustees announced
that most non-vital workers and
non-tenured professors will be laid
off, and their positions moved to
Bangladore, India.

Said Williams, “We have signed a
four year contract with an Indian
company called Infosys, the same
company that handles the College of
Charleston’s administration. All of
the current jobs that fall under the
heading of ‘administration’ will be
handled in India. We are confident
that Infosys employees will handle
their duties efficiently and compe-
tently, at a highly competitive price.”

While the outsourcing of manu-
facturing jobs has been common-
place for many years, companies
have only recently begun to move en-
tire departments of “white collar
jobs,” such as customer service or ac-
counting, to developing countries
such as India or Bangladesh in order
to increase profits in this competitive
market.

In Davidson’s case, almost the en-
tire administration is being sent off-
shore, including all of the Deans and
their secretaries, Business Services,
Information and Technology Ser-
vices, and the Student Counseling
Center.

Not affected by the move are the
College President, the Physical Plant,

Commons to feature
international lasagnas

As part of an effort to cater to what
Dining Services director Sherri Lehman
calls “increasingly globalized taste buds,”
Vail Commons will start serving multi-
ethnic versions of lasagna starting next
week.

“Our Mexican lasagna has always
been a big hit, but we’re looking beyond
Mexico for inspiration these days. I’m
thinking Peru, Russia, maybe even Viet-
nam. Heck, these kids weren’t alive in
the ‘60s,” said Lehman in a recent inter-
view.

With food provider Sysco increasing
its Asian product line last fall, it was only
a matter of time before Vail Commons
produced such variations on their menu.

In the 10,000 square foot test kitchen
buried deep beneath the Belk lawn, chefs
consistently work on new recipes for the
hot food buffet at the Commons.

Recently much of their time has been
devoted to exploring varieties of rice and
new burger patties with creamy ketchup
centers.

“Students here don’t realize how
many varieties of rice are out there,”
feels one chef who wished to remain
anonymous. “Sure they can add and sub-
tract, but when it comes to rice, these
kids are living in a bubble,” he said with
concern.

- Lehman was hesitant when the con-
versation shifted to Chicken Parmesan,
a very popular dish among Davidson
Students. But, she ensured that the new
lasagnas would not interfere with its
customary appearance on the menu, but

also insinuated that the test kitchen
was experimenting with new
Parmesan recipes.

Speculation among students has
led to rumors about new Commons
Parm recipes using water chestnuts
and grapefruit.

Other rumors on campus have
linked Vail Commons’ food with
Davidson’s high percentage of stu-
dents choosing to study abroad.
Lehman called such claims, “un-
true.”

Testing on lasagna culminated
over the summer, resulting in three
new recipes: Bangkok Lasagna with
peanut sauce, “Get Lei-d” Hawaiian
lasagna, and Canadian noodle-free
lasagna. Davidson’s first ever Lasa-
gna Week begins September 27.

Patterson Court chefs feel that La-
sagna Week is the latest sign that
Vail Commons continual offers vital
competition. .

“I don’t know where we would be
without the Commons,” said one
longtime eating house chef. “They're
consistently raising the bar, always
staying one step ahead. But,I know
that most of the houses are empty
when Taste of Japan rolls by.”

“We're really excited about the

-coming week,” said Lehman, “I

couldn’t ask for a better job. Seeing -
the looks on students’ faces as they
pass through the [buffet] line and try |
what we've come up with... well, it’s
simply a blessing.”

Dining Services, the Laundry, and Campus Se-
curity. Furthermore, all classes formerly taught
by non-tenured professors will now be run from
India.

According to sources within the Board, they
have been considering this move at differing
levels of severity for over a year, stemming from
the need to drastically cut costs following huge
infrastructure improvements such as the reno-
vation of both Chambers and Belk Dormitory, as
well as the costs incurred from the new soccer
stadium, Alumni Field.

Explained former Assistant Dean of Students
Dr. Walter Joyner, “While I clearly am not
happy about losing my job, I do understand why
the college made the decision. It’s just too hard
to stay competitive while paying the high sala-
ries and benefits demanded by American em-
ployees. I can’t say that I didn’t see it coming.”

Most students were both upset and surprised
by the news. Complained Anthony Gwynn ’05,
“This ruins the close knit community feel that
was the reason that I chose to go Davidson. I
just can’t feel that comfortable talking to my
‘advisor’ who I’ve never met and she is halfway
around the world. And I can’t imagine being
disciplined by some ‘Dean of Students’ who’s
some dude sitting in India.”

Agreed Christina Miller ’08 “I already called .
the Registrar to make sure that I got credit for
my AP’s, and I didn’t understand a word he said.
Honestly, I don’t think he knew to give me credit

for my Bio AP. Plus, we need
to submit our Pass-Fail forms
two weeks early to allow for
mailing to India, and my Soci-
ology class gets cancelled ev-
ery other period because the
satellite feed from India keeps
freezing.”

Sophomore Gary Gallego
was troubled by the human
cost of the move. “This is just
another example of corporate
greed. These people were our
friends, our mentors, and our
confidantes. Now they are out
of jobs.”

Some students see positives
from the outsourcing. “I must
say, the new Dean of Faculty is extremely

tremely polite

polite and his English is outstanding.”
Said Steven Balboni ’06. “And when I call
ITS around midnight, there’s always
someone to talk to now.”

The President of Davidson College also
has an upbeat view of the outsourcing.
“Granted, many of my friends are no
longer working for the college, and this
saddens me greatly. But, I agree with the
Board of Trustees that this was a move
that the college needed to make in order
to stay competitive with our peer institu-
tions.”

“Plus,” he added, “we're always looking
to have a more international focus.”

~ Steve Brahms ’07 had
quite a weekend down at

the court. Not only did he
hook up with a freshman girl
on the dance floor at

Turner, he brought another
freshman back to his room
to watch “Gone in 60 Sec-_ -
onds.” Suffice it to say, they
hooked up as well! But,
Steve wasn’t done. The next
night, he hooked up with a
Junior lacrosse player in
Connor, and went back to
her place.

Commons _
incident rocks
campus

As Section VII of the Code of Respon-
sibility states, “It is the responsibility of
students to respect the property and
rights of others. Therefore, students will
not engage in any form of activity which
results in or might naturally result in (1)
damage to property, (2) interference with
the rights of members of the community
or visitors, or (3) interference with the
normal activities of the College.” Last
week, however, two or even all three of
these clauses may have been broken dur-
ing an incident at the Vail Commons. At
around 12:15 PM on Thursday a glass fell
from the tray of a masked student to the
floor, shattering on impact. The student
then dropped his tray and sprinted out
the back doors towards Patterson Court.
His identity has not been discovered as of
yet.

Many are distraught over this incident.
Dining Services employee Robin Steele,
who was swiping CatCards at the time,
was taken aback by the student’s behav-
ior. “Sure, sometimes students will break
a glass or spill some cereal,” said Robin,
“but they’re usually always responsible
about it. They'll pay the $1.04 that it costs
to replace the glass and some even offer to
help clean it up.”

Honor Council member, Chris
Martinez, stated, “This unknown
student’s disregard for the Code of Re-
sponsibility is nearly unprecedented. If
his identity is ever revealed, he will prob-
ably come before the Honor Council on
the charges of: ‘engaging in an activity
that resulted in damage to property, inter-
ference with the rights of dining guests to
aclean floor, and interference with the ac-
tivity of a normal lunch.”

Members of the faculty and student
body are upset about this event as well.
Professor of Anthropology, Dr. Warren
Rawlings, is considering leaving his ten-
ured position because of it. “I decided to
teach here,” Dr. Rawlings declared, “be-
cause I thought the students were of the
highest honor. If a student cannot be
trusted to take responsibility for minor
vandalism, how could I possibly’ ‘im
not to photocopy an entire éssay for, my fi-
nal exam?” Jenny Bishop ’07 has decided
to take higher security precautions after
hearing of the incident. Jenny informed
us, “I lock my doors every time I leave the
room now. I just don’t feel safe anymore
knowing someone that’s capable of such a
dishonorable act is roaming unchecked
around campus.”

Not just those on campus were affected
by the vandalism, but the entire commu-
nity of the town of Davidson. Local com-
munity activist, Linda McDonald, was
outraged that this could happen. “I just
can’t believe that someone who signed the
Honor Code has the capability to commit

_such a heinous act,” Linda is on record

saying. “I’ve sent two or three ads to the
Crier reminding everyone how serious
this episode is and demanding that the
perpetrator turn himselfin, My kids are
coached in soccer by a Davidson student,
and I’m not sure if I’m going to take them
to practice anymore with the knowledge
that their coach could be a Code of Re-
sponsibility breaker.”

Some students, however, feel that the
whole occurrence has been exaggerated a
bit. Said Benjamin Titus ’05, “Who
cares?” Karen Stiles ’08 explained, “They
had too many glasses at Commons

anyways.” Furthermore, one masked stu-

dent commented, “I’m pretty sure who-
ever dropped the glass has already fled to
Canada by now, so we should probably all
