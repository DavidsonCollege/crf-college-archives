more than compensate for everyone
else around him. His mien is bullish,
yet endearing and easily makes him
the most enjoyable, and genuine,
character of the film.

While it is the director who con-
trols the flawless visual presentation
of The Untouchables and the actors

who draw out our catharsis, the lion’s .

share of this film’s success has got to
go to Pulitzer Prize-winning play-
wright, David Mamet. Donning the
mantle of screenwriter for The Un-
touchables, he has created such finely
detailed characters that they cannot

help but be fully realized by the ac-
tors. Even more noteworthy is the
fact that no screen time is wasted for
this. All of the personalities are evi-
denced by dialogue thatserves only to
move the story along and/or increase
our involvement. Mamet’s writing of
this film is the perfect compliment to
director, Brian De Palma. The tight-
ness of the script allows De Palma to
focus his talents on the images that
have made him one of the foremost
directors of our time.

Brian De Palma, long rebuked as
the bad-boy of the director’s set, is in
rare form. Not since Blow Out has he
managed to create a film of the power
and scope of The Untouchables. The

long, drawn out camera pans and
stolen Hitchcock angles that, ironi-
cally, have become De Palma’s own
hallmark have never been as carefully
exploited as they have been in this
film. Infamous for his blatant plagia-
rism of: other’ movies and directors,
the stolen Odessa Steps sequence
from Eisenstein’s .Potemkin is re-
made with utter brilliance by De

Palma. It stands out as the piece de

resistance of what is an already gour-
met, cinematic smorgasbord.

Playing this Friday at 9:45:p.m.; in

the 900 Room, The Untouchables is a ;

landmark film by a landmark director
of a landmark era.

of the level. This is a self-conscious
way of bringing home to the audience
‘the unbalanced nature of the relation:

ship between Cal and his father. -
Ultimately,. Kazan pulls together
the qualities of this production that
make it extraordinary. With the
screenplay, the acting, the filming,
and.the direction, he creates a monu-

Admission $1.50. And do remember
