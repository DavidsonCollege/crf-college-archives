Sharing Of Power

Protest after protest continue to mount against the
comprehensive fee. In addition to the Student Life Com-
mittee’s memo to the president last week, two more pro-
tests arrived on the president’s blotter this week, one in
the form of a petition and the other in the form of a re-
solution passed by the fraternities. .

As the battle against the comprehensive fee pro-
cedes, however, it becomes increasingly clear that the
fee itself is a rather insignificant issue. For the majority
sf the students, they will be paying exactly what they
ire paying now. With alterations such as the exclusion
3f the board and social fees, the comprehensive fee would
be satisfactory.

The real issue ai the basis of all the controversy is
that of governance: who makes the decision and how
is it made. Considered from the standpoint of college gov-
ernance, the comprehensive fee has been a disaster.

In short the fee was imposed by administrative fiat.
Neither faculty nor students were consulted or even ad-
vised of this decision. The administrative triumverate made
the decision, the letters was sent out and that was the end
of the matter as far as the president and vice presidents
were concerned.

Such actions cause both faculty and students to won-
der as to how much trust they can really place in the ad-
ministration. It is no small wonder that the faculty and
students are suspicious of the administration’s motives
on the Governance Committee. They ask themselves how
it is that discussion of the issue of coeducation and the
union should be open to imputs from all constituiences,
yet the comprehensive fee is closed to such suggestions?

Even after initial protests were made, no attempt
was made to include students or faculty members in the
final decision of the fee. Although we have confidence
that the vice presidents will not try to impose the com-
prehensive fee as it is proposed upon students, we still
believe that if the administration truly believes in shar-
ing of power, they will share power on all decisions, not
just ones they choose.

Campus Security

The problem of compus security is one which must be
met with all due speed, for the safety of all students. If
the college entertains any hopes at all of continued junior
year coeds on the Eight College Exchange Program, or
if the college expects any coeds to become regular stu-
dents in the near future, improved security is an absolute
necessity.

If the quality of life at Davidson is to be maintained,
students must feel safe in leaving their rooms unlocked,
and must feel secure in the fact that when ‘they return
from Christmas vacation all the furnishings of their fra-
ternity house will still be there. No more empty holes in
the walls on Jackson Court. No more petty thievery in the
dorms. The college must hire more security personnel, es-
pecially at night.

But the problem cannot be met by the administration
alone. Students must become concerned about the security
of their campus for two reasons. They must exercise their
right to ask strangers if they have a destination and an
invitation—those “no trespassing” signs are for real. They
must use more caution in looking out for strangers and in
helping, rather than laughing at, the security force.

They must secondly become concerned about campus
security to insure their own freedom. They must stay at-
tuned to administration proposals, exploring all the im-
plications of those plans. Over breaks it is important that
town police patrol the campus; during the term it is im-
portant that they not enter the grounds and inhibit stu-
dent activities by their presence as law enforcers on cam-
pus.

The line between a safe, free campus and a police
state is pencil-lead thin. We hope that students will be-
come actively involved in the search for solutions to the
security problem, for their own protection. The administra-
tion has no plans for instituting a police state, but it is up
to the students to protect themselves from a time when
such a system is necessary.

Well, as I sit before my fine-
honed instrument of destruc-
tion, a tank of a Remington.
courtesy of the Carolina Inn
Gang, I ponder what to do with
my new-found position of pow-
er. I’ve never been in a position
of power before. Experience, vi-
carious though it may be, tells
me that I should consider how
or whether-or-not to offend
whom, but perhaps I should
leave that to the veterans.
(Should a journalist use a “‘per-
sona” for safety's sake?)

I could begin a series of con-
fessions. ‘‘Confessions of a Cat-
Keeper: Stunning Exposes of
Flagrant Disregard for the Foun-
dations of Order in the Continu-
ing College Community!” ‘‘View
from the Widow's Walk: An In-
side Look at the Lives and
Loves of the Elite Corps of Hon-
ors College Subversives—Frank,
Raw, Brutal!” ‘I Ran With the
Pack: The No-Punches-Pulled
Stary of the Student Who Train-
ed a Marauding Band of Strays
to Rend Campus Security Offi-
cers into Itsy Bitsy Little Piec-
es!’

Of all these indiscretions or
variations thereof, I am guilty.
But do these matters capture
the public’s (that’s you) imagi-
nation? More important, will
they fill up an eighty line (fifty-
five space) column as per or-
dered?

I could stay within the bounds
of my forte and keep Davidson
abreast of all the most recent
literary events. Faulkner died.

On the other hand, I could
ferret out scoops about current
events around the campus po-
litical circles. An unnamed but
completely reliable source has
exposed a plot to overthrow the
Peebles administration. The
band of fierce guerrillas (guer-
rilae?) will be led by a famed
revolutionary and military lead-
er known only as ‘The Eel.”

The purposes of the coup, the
source said, were to reinstate
the old values of ... well, to
reinstate the old. Anyway, it
will be back to rhythm for the
Davidson student. When asked
to comment on the possible
changes in sight, the popular
off-campus senator, the Honor-
able William Rowland, said
‘Prepare ye the way of the
Lord!"

Perhaps wise suggestions for
improving Davidson life would
best suit my unfamiliar posi-
tion. Gee fellas, let’s go com-
pletely co-ed, huh, huh? And
about that Union food: why
can’t I ever get any whortle-
berries out of the machines?
Answer me that, Establishment
Flunkies!

I suggest we have a vending
machine with nothing but whor-
tleberries. And free lunches,
dinners. Furthermore, all of the
colege's financial troubles would
be solved if we channeled all
funds previously used for schol-
arships into a ‘‘jai alai” team.
We haven't had a good ‘‘jai
alai” match in years.

Alas, all these things have
been said before time and again
and better. I should strive to
give you (if you're still read-

ing) a fresh viewpoint on some-
thing I know as no other. There
is only one such subject: Post-
night Davidson. Yes, David-
son as I really know it, in the
hours beyond those of conven-
tional nighttime, in the hours of
three a.m., four, five, yea even
into six.

1 realize that the average Da-
vidson student knows as much
about daytime Davidson as the
next. You all know, for exam-
ple, that the post office boxes
at eight, eleven, and four each
day. You all know that L. Din-
kins built the Helper Inn in
1837. And that it's thirty-eight
paces between Phi Hall and Eu
Hall. These are all facts of the
nocnday life.

But how many of you know
that the traffic light at Concord
and Main changes every thirty
seconds or that the Duchess

bread truck drives by at four
each morning? Two lonely stran-
gers, flashing and passing re-
spectively through the oblivious
night.

All too well do I know these
outcasts of day, seen only by
the hollow buildings of the cam-
pus, resplendent in dew and in-
adequate lighting. E’en so.

My calling, then, to right a
wrong, to give the dark side of
Davidson a chance to shine.
Nor will the campus itself be
the sole beneficiary, for at last
I can do my part to help each
Davidson student use his college
to its fullest capacity, under-
standing his (or her for you few
and far between) campus at all
hours. Perhaps the administra.
tion will wake up to the wasted
potential and schedule some
pre dawn classes! Think about
it.

Lack Of Motivation
Cuts Both Ways

To the Editor:

As ore of the members of the
class of 1975 who has already
left the hallowed confines of
Davidsen College, I feel com-
pelled to reply to Dr. Spencer's
“explanation of the rather ab-
rupt departure of four fresh-
men. The reknowned President
of the illustrious ‘‘Princeton of
the South” has claimed that
these students (myself includ-
ed) left due to a “lack of aca-
demic motivation.”

Being able to speak only for

myself, I am forced to agree
with Dr. Spencer. Lack of aca-
demic motivation did play an
important part in my decision
to transfer.

However, Dr. Spencer should
be extremely cautious when cit-
ing ‘lack of academic motiva-
tion” as a reason for student
transfers. Surely he must real-
ize that such a statement casts
at least as much blame, if not
more, on the school than on the
individual student! ‘Lack of
student motivation” is merely
the effect of a much more seri-
ous problem which, if not cor-
rected, must have disastrous ef-
fects on the entire college com-
munity.

This problem is the failure of
the Administration and Faculty
to stimulate and sustain aca-
demic motivation in the stu-
dents.

A word of advice, Sam: Heed
the cries of ‘frustration and
disillusionment’ among the stu-
dents. After all, they are the
ones who support you and
yours, and who will continue to
do so as alumni, if they don’t
drop out or transfer duc to
“lack of academic motivation”
before they graduate. Think
about it, Sam. Remember, “lack
of academic motivation” is a
handy phrase, but it cuts deep.
ly both ways.

To the Editor:

In the latest student govern
ment electicns there were sev-
eral offices filled by unopposed
candidates. Election reforms
are needed to assure that in
the future students are given
the opportunity to approve or
disapprove every candidate.

Not every student who regis.
lers as a candidate is qualified
lo carry out the duties of his
Selected position, mor is he al-
ways Supported by the majority
of the students. To allow a can-
didate to assume an office with-
out student approval is a great
injustice to the school.

A means of correcting this
Siiuation is to allow students to
check for or against every un-
opposed candidate. A majority
is needed before the candidate
can assume his office. If he
does not gain a majority of the
vote, then the position will be
filled by the student govern-
ment.

The present system allows any
student the opportunity to gain
an office by simply registering
immediately before the final
deadline. He is not required to
present a platform: his  opin-
ions are not challenged: and he
may not represent the best in-
tcrests of the majority of the
Davidson students.

If Davidson is to have a pro-
ductive student government, then
it must be responsive to the
wants and needs of the stu-
dents. It cannot be responsive
under the present system, as
unopposed candidates do not
hecessarily reflect the views of
the majority.

Personal interests can easily
mar the organization’s produc-
tivity. Election reforms are
needed.
