Varsity Debaters
Will Hold Tryouts
Beginning Tonight

Eliminations to be Held on
Wednesday, Thursday and
Monday Nights

MANY ARE COMPETING

Finals to be Held Night of No-
vember Fifteenth

The tryouts for the Davidson debat-
ing team, which has the prospects of
being one of the strongest teams ever
to represent Davidson, will be held in
Chambers Auditorium tonight, Thurs-
day night, and the following Monday
night, with the finals scheduled for
Wednesday, November 15. The time
for each tryout is at 7:00 p. m.

An immense amount of interest has
been shown in debating this year which
was exhibited by the large number of
boys who responded to the call for
tryouts made by Ed Humphrey, presi-
dent of the Forensic Council. Forty-
two men announced their intentions of
trying out for the debating team,
which made it necessary to divide the
tryouts into three elimination contests.
Fourteen men will debate tonight and
tomorrow night, respectively, and the
same number will debate the following
Monday.

Four men will be chosen from each
group, and the final tryout for these
twelve men will be held'on Wednes-
day evening, November 15, From these
men the nine best debaters will be se-
lected who will compose the debating
team of six men and three alternates.
The judges of the debates will be Dr.
C. K. Brown, Prof. E. J. Erwin, Prof.
A. Currie, and Dr. P. H, Gwynn.

Subject of the debate is “ Resolved:
That the Powers’ of the President of
the United States Should be Substan-
tially Increased as.a Settled Policy.”
Each speaker is limited to five minutes
and must develop only one point on
either side of the argument. The con-
testants will be judged on the con-
clusiveness and the persuasiveness of
the argument presented, the oratorical
ability and stage conduct of the speak-
er, and the use of the English language
with special emphasis on the construc-
tion of sentences.

With indications of an excellent de-
bating team to represent Davidson,
three extensive’ trips have been
ranged by the Forensic Council.

ar-
The
team will meet leading colleges and
universities in the North, South, and
West. These meets are scheduled for
the early spring. The team will de-
bate Lehigh University, Washington
and Lee, University of Richmond, Cen-
tre College, Southwestern University,
College of Charleston, University of
Georgia, University of Florida,
University of Miami.

and

It is the desire of the Forensic Coun-

to stimulate much interest as
possible the campus toward the
debating team at Davidson. Ed Hum-
phrey, president of the Council, stated
that he would like to urge the mem:
bers of the student body to be present
at the debating trials, and particularly
on the final night,to constitute an au-
dience for the speakers. The subject
of the debate is ‘a’ topic of. national

Library Displays
Oriental Curios

Examples of Japanese and Rus-
sian Arts Are Shown

The coin collection in the library
has been replaced this week by an
exhibit of Russian and Japanese art.
This exhibit includes a Russian ikon
and two Japanese household gods.

The Russian ikon, an,image of the
Grand Duke Alexander, was bought
by Dr. Frazer Hood while, he was in
Italy, where it had been brought by
a, Russian emigrant who took it from
the Cathedral of Minsk. It has been
blessed by a patriarch of the Greek
Orthodox Church, and therefore is
considered by orthodox believers to
have special sanctity and the ability
to perform miracles.

The Japanese household gods are
gifts to Dr. W. P. Cumming from a
converted Christian. They are paint-
ings of great antiquity, and have been
worshipped for generations in the pri-
vate shrines of the homes of the do-
nor’s ancestors.

Last For Nine

Nine members of the Davidson
football squad will make their
final home appearance when the

Committee Chooses
Rhodes Applicants

Seven Seniors and Three Juniors
Selected to Compete for
Scholarship

The committee on Rhodes Scholar-

ships, composed of Professors H. T.
Lily, W. P. Cumming, and. G. R,
Vowles, have recommended the ap-

plication of ten Davidson students for
the Rhodes Scholarships. G. H. Brown
will appear before the examining com-
mittee in New Jersey, Odi Casali and
Gordon Wood in West Virginia, W. B.
Ravenel in South Carolina, W.. T.
Thompson in Virginia, J. A. McGeachy,
Rufus C. Morrow, Francis H. Scott,
W. M. Thompson, and E, J. Hum-
phreys in North Carolina.

Careful consideration was given to
all applicants, and a written report to
the executive committee of the faculty
Wes made and passed on by them.
Two from each ‘state will be selected,
and at’a district meeting a choice of
four will be made from the twelve
candidates from six states.

There were ten applicants for the
North Carolina scholarships. The com-
mittee found it very difficult to re-
duce the number to five, the number
allowed any one state. Applications
were sent the recommended candidates
and must’be in the hands of the state
committee by November 18th.

System of Selecting
Managers is Changed

At the meeting of the Davidson Ath-
letic Council last Friday night, the
method of electing football managers
was somewhat altered. Prior to this,
only lettermen have been allowed to
cast votes for the three Junior and
three Senior managers. In the future
all men out for varsity football will
have a vote in filling these positions.
Because varsity managerships are such
important posts, one major and two
minor letters being given to the three
Senior managers, more of a popular
vote was desired in picking from the
candidates. Because of this the sys-
tem of election was changed.

Vesper Speaker in
Armistice : Address

To Talk on “Possibility of World
Peace in Our Day”

STATE-WIDE PEACE MOVE

Sponsored by Executive Commit-
tee of College “Y’” Cabinets

In place of the regular program of
Y. M. C. A. vespers, this Sunday, No-
vember 12th, will bring a special type
of procedure to the students of Da-
vidson College in the form of an Arm-
istice Day address.

This program will follow out the
spirit of a resolution, made at the fall
meeting of the North Carolina Stu-
dent Y..W. C.-A. and Y. M.-C. A.
Cabinet and Executive Committee,
which met in Greensboro October 15th.

The resolution, in part, was as fol-
lows: “In the past the major emphasis
has been on war, and it is the purpose
of this body to promote the idea of
peace in the commemoration of Arm-
istice Day this year.”

Thus it would seem that this body
is striving, by the devotion of this
time to a program concerning world
peace, to avoid, in the greatest degree
possible, the usual spirit of war on
that day, and to have a spirit of peace
on the campuses of the colleges of the

son committee, for the carrying out,

of this project, is Dr. D. P. McGeachy,
of the Decatur Presbyterian Church
in Decatur, Ga. Dr. McGeachy plans
to speak to the vesper group on the
subject,’ “The Possibility of World
Peace in Our Day.”

The speaker has announced that he
will make his appeal to the stude ts
constructive rather than critical. Since
Dr. McGeacliy is recognized in the
South as an authority on the subject
of world peace, the program will carry
an added weight.

Dr. McGeachy is quite well known
in ministerial circles in the South, hay-
ing been the pastor of the Decatur
Presbyterian Church for some years.
He has had three sons to graduate
from Davidson College, and one of
these sons is now preaching in a near-
by pastorate.
A special effort is being extended

the Y. M. C. A, leaders to have
a full attendance at the vesper service
this Sunday, and the students are urged
to co-operate with the Y. M. C. A. in
the carrying out of the Armistice Day
program,

North Carolina Formerly Called
Rip Van Winkle

Last Monday night, A. R. Newsome,
of Raleigh, delivered a lecture on the
history of North Carolina before Da-
vidson students. After serving as sec-
North Historical
Commission, he taught at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina. He is now the
of the State Literary and
Historic Association. He was intro-
duced by Dr. J. M. MeConnell, dean
of the faculty.

The title of the lecture was “North
Carolina 1815-1935, Awakening of Rip
Van Winkle.” Newsome said that in
1815 there were many more slaves
than white people in North Carolina.
The population of over half of the
counties decreased and the population
of the state as a whole decreased. In
the middle east portion of the state
the people were more educated and
more cultured than in the west. The
land valuations decreased very much,

Goblins and Ghosts Offer Thrills
as Halloween Night is Celebrated

Lack of Color and Costumes of Davidson Cz:npus Spooks Does
Not Detract From Audacity of Pranks

Halloween night proved a source of
much merrymaking and hilarity in Da-
vidson and the neighboring towns,
Warm weather combined with the
spirit of the crowds placed this year’s
celebration far ahead of recent ones.
No one shivered from cold, but there
were goblins and ghosts enough to
produce cold shivers, particularly
among those of superstitious Nature.
Noise makers converted the usual
quiet of the evening into a veritable
din, and costumes lent a spookish air
to the scene.

Several boarding houses on the col-
lege campus were attractively deco-
rated with corn stalks, pumpkins, and
Halloween accessories, while many de-
lightful parties were given for the
younger boys and girls.

What struck the close observer with
more force than the costumes, the
noises or anything else, however, was
the wholeheartedness with which the
people entered into the fun. There
seemed to be a different spirit in the
larger towns, from the previous cele-
brations held last year. More people
participated, when before they had re-
mained on the curbstones and, whether
due to frozen fingers or frozen assets,
seemed content to let the other fellow
put on the show.

Davidson’s celebration was fairly
quiet when compared with larger
towns, but there are many freshmen

here, whose peaceful nature was some
what imposed upon in the early hours
of the morning. At 2:00 a. m., a long
wail from the siren brought many stu-
dents down to the Student Store in
their pyjamas, to learn that it was only
a false alarm. This ceremony was
immediately followed by a mid-night
round of several upperclassmen to
freshmen’s rooms, apparently for no
good reason (taken from the fresh-
men’s point of view). .

A few freshmen who boasted that
they had no fear of the “Big Black
Bear,” were terrified in the dead of
the night by the appearance of a seem-
ingly huge monster, which gleamed
grotesquely at them. However, upon
investigation, they found that it was
nothing but a gentle calf, which had
been led around by two sophomores
to inflict terror upon the freshmen.
Several men who had the ill fortune
to be out of town at that time, re-
turned to find their personal belong-
ings piled at a ridiculous angle in the
halls or any other place which ap-
pealed to the humor of the movers.

The numerous opportunities of stir-
ting up the anger of the football man-
agers was taken into consideration by
certain mischievous boys of the town,
and the signs over which the managers
so patiently struggled were found in
various foreign places.

Armory Rifle Range

Sergeant B. R. Burton, of the R. O.

pleted several internal improvements
on the Armory building, the major
part of his efforts being concentrated
on the rifle range in the basement.

In place of the old lighting system
on the range, a new and improved
one has been installed, in which, un-
like the old, those firing are not at all
blinded by exposed bulbs and at the
same time they are unable to shoot
the lights out.’ The windows have
been securely closed to allow better
vision.
