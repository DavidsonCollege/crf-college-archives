a strain or two of this selection Mon-

day night, because its melodies have been
borrowed to make a theme song for a
musical comedy, a popular song, and a
stirring march. These latter composi-
tions are simple and hence available, but
the symphony can onl ycome to us thru
such mediums as the symphony orchestra
or a great pianist. Thus Davidson
will haye the opportunity of hear-
ing masterpieces played by artists as well
as having them discussed by an interest-
ing and appealing speaker. During Pro-
fessor Steckel’s lecture-recital, numerous
selections will be given on the Steinway-
Duo-Art Reproducing Piano, With each
oach one he will give a short talk about
the composer and the selection. In the
course of the program, the following
numbers will be given:

The Music Box—Leadoff; (Played by
Leginska. )

Unfinished Symphony (First Move-
ment)—Schubert; (Played by Albert
Stoessel. )

Fantasie—Impromptu (Opp. 66) Cho-
pin; (Played by Harold Bauer.)

Ave Maria—Schubert; (Played
Robert Ambruster.)

Hark, Hark! the LLark—Schubert-
Lizt; (Played by Paderewski.)

by

Turkish March—Beethoven; (Played
by Harold Bauer.)
Ase’s Death (Peer Gynt)—Greig;

(Played by Percy Crainger.)

Day Break (Peer Gynt)—Greig;
(Played by’ Percy Crainger.)

The recital is to be presented through
the courtesy of Parker-Gardner Company,
Charlotte, N.C.

We all ought to be thankful,
says Felix, that we are not taken
seriously by our friends.

Vatied Professions
Call Davidson Men

Number of Undecided Men Shows
Large Decrease

A comparative study of the profess:ons
which Davidson College students intend
to pursue as a life work reveals the in-
teresting fact that aver a period of five
years, those intending to enter the busi-
ness world and medical profession have
heen increasing, candidates for the min-
istry have remained practically the same,
the law profession has added a number
of future attorneys, and the teaching pro-
will claim) double the number
specifying their intentions in 1923.

fession

Perhaps the most interesting observa-
tion, however, was the decided decrease
in those students who stated they were
undecided. In 1923-1924 the total was
223, the following year it went up, to
236, but had been gradually diminishing
since that time until the comparatively
smal! number of only 142 expressed in-
decision this year.

Comparative figurdy wr 1923-1924 and
192-1929 for the leading selections of pro-
fessions follow: Medicine, to 96;

LITERARY SOCIETIES

Philanthropic

The feature of the program of the Phil-
anthropie Literary Society was the sec-
ond debate in the class debatingtourna
ment now being held in that society. The
juniors upholding the affirmative of the
query “Resolved that trial by jury should
he abolished,? eliminated the seniors who
had the negative. The Junior team was
coposed of Jasper Black and Frank Er-
win. Helm and B. F. Brown represented
the seniors.

Eumanean

In the Eunemean Literary society the
program was devoted to an open forum
on the query, “Resolved that Congress
should adopt the Crusier Bill.” The fol-
lowing men spoke, Dumas, J. C. Matt-
hews, Bird, T. FE. Hill, J. A. Ward, and
J. F. Preston. A vote of the house was
in favor of the affirmative.

Dr. Chas. Young
Dies At Albany

Dr. and Mrs. J. W. MacConnell have
received news of the sudden death of
their brother-in-law, Dr. Charles
Young, Director of the State Labora-
tories at Albany, N. Y. Dr. Young re-
turned from Peking a few months ago
where he had been head of the
Pathological Department of the Union
Medical College. He has been
China for a number of years, and was
recognized as one of the world au-
thorities on plague and kala-azar and
other oriental diseases. He was an
honor graduate of the University of
Illinois and of Johns Hopkins, and has
been with the Rockefeller Foundation
for Medical Research for several years,
having made several trips around the
world investigating plague at different
points and was decorated by the Im-
perial Chinese government for
work in Manchuria. His death is a
distinct loss to the medical work. He
was enroute to Harvard University
to prepare for the publication of his
latest investigations when he died sud-
denly from heart disease. Dr. McFad-
yen, of Davidson, was associated with
him in his work in China.
