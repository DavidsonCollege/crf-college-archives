IFC Moves Toward
Unique Homecoming

By BOB MOORE
Davidsonian Managing Editor

“I am very happy with the progress of the Inter-
fraternity Council in making Homecoming a better dance
wéekend,” IFC president Ward McKeithen stated early
this week. “The council wants to promote a Homecom-
ing weekend directed toward more student participa-
tion and is taking “steps to make it unique from the

other dance weekends.”

The IFC announced ifs plans.

for a “bigger and - better”
Homecoming several weeks
ago, when it indicated that the
Tommy Dorsey Band under the
direction of Warren Covington
had been secured for the .two
dances. “We feel they will add
a great deal, for the band’s
style is definitely different
from previous dance weekend
Yands,” McKeithen continued.

HOMECOMING QUEEN

One of the new -additions to
this year’s Homecoming will be
the presentation of a Home-
coming Queen at the half-fime
ceremonies of the {football
game. Each fraternity will se-
lect a representative to com-
pete for the crown.

The queen will be selected at
the formal dance Friday night
by Warren Covington and mem-
bers of the faculty and student
body. The presentation of the
fraternity queens will replace
the traditional figure of the
IFC members and their dates,

The IFC is placing more em-
phasis this year on the fraterni-
ty Homecoming exhibits. The
fraternity with the best exhibit
will receive a trophy and $25.
Second prize will be $15 and
third prize will be $10. The
exhibits will be judged Satur-
day morning.

GIRL CHEERLEADERS
A_ special addition to the
Homecoming will be four girf
cheerleaders,

The council is still trying to
find someone to serve as the
Davidson Elder for the football
game. If anyone is interested,
he should apply to the IFC.

Prior to the football game
the Honor Platoon will give a
precision drill performance.
During halftime the ROTC
band and the Lenoir High
School band will march.

The IFC is sponsoring a spe-
cial chapel program the Friday
of Homecoming. The exact na-
ture of the program cannot be
announced at this time, but it
will be in keeping with the
light atmosphere of the weck-
end. A pep rally is also plan-
ned for Thursday night.

DORSEY CONCERT

The Dorsey Band has re-
quested that it be allowed to
present a concert following the
game Saturday afternoon. The
IFC had originally planned to
eliminate the concert to avoid
excess expenses. The concert
will be held in Chambers Au-
ditorium.

The IFC plans to recommend
to next year’s council to investi-
gate the possibility of having
a fraternity stunt night on Fri-
day before the formal dance.
If a stunt night is not possible,
the Council hopes to have an
Artist Series program of a light
nature.

This year’s Artist Series pro-
gram for the Homecoming

Semester venture.

During his two day stay here,
Packard, who has been termed
a “social critic of. the first
rank”, will address the student
body, participate in panel dis-
cussions, hold question and
answer forums, and attend
classes, all in an effort to dis-
cuss and elaborate upon his

of the New York Times. He will
speak on the subject “A New
Look at the Soviet Challenge”.

Student Describes Stay

into the hands of the enemy. This nineteen year old
South Korean, co-chief of the anti-communist movement
in his home town of Mokpo, had been studying at the
University of Korea in Seoul for only one month when
the North Korean invasion began.

Nam Young had relatives in
Seoul and was hidden in the
home of friends of his grand-
parents when the Communists
captured him. He was kept at
a prison in Seoul where he was
subject to constant questioning,
carried on primarily at night.

Questioning would begin at
about 10:30 p.m. This would
last about fifteen minutes; the
prisoner would then be allowed
to go back to bed, only to be
wakened about an hour later.
This continued every night.
Any time there was any con-
flict in stories, physical and
mental torture resulted.

The prisoners were ‘given on-
ly one meal a day, consisting
3£ very poor barley. New pris-
oners were unable to stomach
this horrible diet for the first
few days of their tenure. How-
ever, they soon came to the
realization that it was barley
or nothing. Many prisoners died
ag a result of the poor food.

After a month in this
prison, Nam Young, along
with other prisoners, was
ordered to march to a’prison
across the town of Seoul.

“ready and enthusiastic accept-

by saying, “It’s good to see the

and relevant program .

tinue to stir and disturb us.”

Nam Young knew if he re-

breaking ranks; so he decided
he might as well try to escape.
He was successful and, after
holing up in Seoul for a day,
returned to Mokpo. Communi-
cation between Seoul and Mok-
po had ceased; so Nam Young
was not sought for a time.

He acted as an American in-
terpreter for about ten days
and then joined the South Ko-
rean army. In 1956 Nam Young
was able to leave the army and
shortly afterwards his passport
and visas came through, enabl-
ing him to come to the United

“Scripts ‘N’ Pranks’’
Adopts New Policy

On October 27, the firstyi

e of this year’s Scripts

‘n’ Pranks will appear. The (magazine will offer a brand
of humor new to the Davidson student body, just-in tbe
to charm the girls over Homecoming. In addition, this

will be the first issuc after
editor Charles Cornwell.
According to this change in
policy, all members of the stu-
dent body are invited to write
material for Scripts ‘n’ Pranks.
Editor Cornwell stated, “It is
essentially my belief that this
is a student publication and
that the students should be giv-

| en every opportunity to contri-

bute.”

Editor Cornwell pointed
out that afl types of material
are welcomed: essays, short
stories, poetry, and anything
else, with the possible ex-
ception of five-act dramas
and Medieval epics. “Our ba-
sis of selection for what is
published will be quality
and readability,” he sunt
marized.

The dead-line for material to
be published in the Christmas
issue is noon, Thursday, No-
vember 5. By that time, all con-
tributions from the student

body should have been handed s
‘class. We hope that this year

in to one~of the staff members.
The editor reiterated his de--
sire to publish in Seripts ‘n’

the -policy changes made by

Pranks as much student writing
as possible. He further stated,
“It is my hope that the Christ-
mas issue will ‘be filled with
material from contributions
outside the staff.”

In reply to a question
about the rumored “question-
able” contents of this first
issue, Cornwell said, “There
have been somo slight
grumblings, but the Publica-
tions Committee has ap-
proved the October 27 issue.
Let me say thet this Com
mittee has in no way acted as
an = arbitrary = censorship
board, but has been most
helpful to us in every re-
spect.”

Cornwell stated that the de-
tails of the freshman contest
would be announced in the
first issue. Urging all interest-
ed freshmen to contribute, he
said, “Last year we had about
ix articles from the entire -

will bring us more and better
material.”
