he said, citing as an example,
“when some one gives an en-
dowment and a student writes
him and thanks him for it.”

Dittman believes there are
two benefits in using students
as fund raisers: ‘‘One, the
most obvious, is to raise
money,” he said. The second
is that people outside the
college will notice that stu- :
dents are involved, and will
improve their opinion and
sympathy for Davidson.

Stahmann suggests that CROP
does more than simply attempt to
alleviate hunger in the world. Accord-
ing to her, CROP deals also with all
the problems of world hunger, includ-
ing population problems.

“Surveys show that birth rates do
«not decline until basic social needs
| have been satisfied, including an
assured food supply and at least
rudimentary health services,” said
Stahmann.

“People naturally want offspring to
‘survive them; if they live in a
situation where food is scarce and
where children die of disease, starva-
tidn or malnutrition, they will feel
that they must have as many children
as possible in order to assure themsel-
ves that some will survive.

“Future oriented hunger relief must

... Student-faculty rapport

that there is always room for
improvement.

Dr. Max Polley, a member
of the group, feels that the
desire to improve faculty-stu-
dent relations is an ongoing
process. “I think that every
generation of students senses
a need for closer ties with the
faculty. It’s very good to get
students and faculty who
share common interests to-
gether, but we must remember
that both students and profes-
sors often engage in hobbies
as @ means of temporarily
escaping from Davidson and,
if that is the case, their
privacy should be respected. I
doubt that informal academic
gatherings would be of much

interest since the pressure here
is a result of assigned academ-
ic work.”

Polley also feels that faculty
relations are weakest with the
sophomore class. ‘‘We really
pull out the stops with the
freshmen each year and jun-
iors and seniors are in close
contact with their. major de-
partments, but the sopho-
mores are left out.’’ He went
on to express regret that large
activities such as student-
faculty golf and tennis tourna-
ments and fish fries fell out of
favor in the 1960's. “This type
of gathering was ideal for
relating to each other as
individuals and I'd like to see
a return to it.”
