Living through far away
matches, spacey bus rides,
after dinner entertainment,
and supermarket doors (you
can ask Tatum), they’ve all
had a lot of fun, and are
expecting next year to be even

Finally, the team would like
to thank graduating seniors
Becca Stimson, Sue McAvoy,
and Ruth Murphy, who each
played a large part in founding
the women’s team, and also
coach Pat Drake, for her work
and support, which the team
couldn’t have done without.
