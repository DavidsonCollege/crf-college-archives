Concert For Large Home-
coming Crowd

The Davidson College Sym-
phonic Band presented a Bene-
fit Concert in Chambers Au-
ditotium on Friday evening,

November 5, at 8:00 o’clock, ;
wThe concert was presented as

a part of the Homecoming
program, and a large number
oi the alumni and friends of
the college attended the con-
cert.

The Symphonic Band was led by
James Christian Pfohl, Director of
Music and the following program
was presented: The Overture
““Zampa” by Herald was the first
number of the concert and this was
followed by “The Miracte Suite” by
Humperdinck, played by the band.
The prelude was the next number
and this was an organ solo played
by Thane McDonald. The Proces-
sion and Children’s Dance was the
following number. The finale con-
sisted of eight numbers, “Under the
Polar Star,” from “Looking Up-
ward Suite.” by Sousa; “Dance
Hongroise” by Ring, Hager, Hirsch,
played by Bernard Hirsch; “Cabins”

cert was concluded by the playing

concert was very successful finan-
clally. The money obtained from

. Harvard football game on Novenr
ber 13. ° .

The Benefit offered to many of
the alumni their first opportunity
of hearing the new alma mater of
Davidson, “The Red And Black.”

. Visualize a Homecoming Day
when we might play a team more
nearly oxy equal: Alumni arriv-
ing on the seene would be = sur-
prised to find that the “old spirit”
was not the same but had grown
and risen to greater heights. They

would join in with the student
body in helping that team along
with their shouts of encourage-
ment. And when the game is over,

no matter whether they are able
to sing the victory march or not,
they could go back home for an-
othey year happy to know that
Davidson teams still fight hard and
play fairly°and that Davidson stu-
dents still have tha fighting spirit.

The thing that we should do for
these returning alumni is give
them a good show for their money.
it isn’t that we lack spirit but that
we have our guests at the wrong
time—when we're already liexed
and we know it. We have to be
able to make Davidson men proud
of their school.

Jake Houston of The Observer
Entertains Class With Talk

The second meeting, of the new
Journalisnttlass started by Fred
Smith was held in Chambers last
Wednesday with “Professor” Jake
Houston, Observer staff photogra-
pher, as the lecturer for: the night's
program,

Tonight, Jaxe Wade, the capable
Observer sports editor, is scheduled
to speak on the subject of sports-
writing, and he promises to be very
interesting.

Professor Houston spoke a full
hour on news photography. and
when he finished, the students ask-
ed for more. He obliged by telling
the stories behind a group of news
pictures he had on display, and
was applauded by the class, who
asked him to appear on a iuture
prograni.

“The pubhe is getting more and
imore picture conscious,” said Mr.
Houston, in speaking ef journalis-
tic development. “Photography has
made more progress in the last ten

years thap it did in the fifty years

previous., Some of the carly por-
traits made in the early days of the_
art are still hard to beat. bur news
photography and ‘the work done by’
the so-called teandid’ cameras are
getting better every day.”
Members 01 tthe Davidson Photo-
graphie Club were special guests of
the class.
