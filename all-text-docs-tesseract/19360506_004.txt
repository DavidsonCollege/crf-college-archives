Fielding Clark, a sophomore

outfield, stole the show, and his
feats afield and at bat were
worthy of high praise. His four-

Wildcats this year. However,
Wood Burns almost gained

membership in this select circle,

to Rabb to the catcher cut him
away at the plate. This hit
scored a man, and had there
been any pause or bobble what-
