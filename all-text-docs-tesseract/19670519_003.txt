A_ NEW FUTURE OUT OF THE BLUE SKY
dited Text Of Report Submitted By The Committee

To The Faculty:

The origins of the Blye Sky
Committee are well known to
most members of the Faculty.
Triggered by the recent Self
Study, the assignment of a
thorough restudy of our aca-
demic program reflects the
long-standing conviction of
many of us that it is time for
a change. The suggestion of
this restudy was received by
the Faculty with enthusiasm.

Enthusiasm has aiso char-
acterized the work of the Com-
mittee. It has worked steadily
and faithfully throughout the
year. Many different sugges-
tions and a great variety of
proposals have been official-
ly and unofficially before it.
But many months of discus-
sions and arguments have end-
ed in a remarkable degree of
agreement on both aims and
means. Most of the recommen-
dations have been adopted with
unanimity: there are no minor-
ity reports.

We have been accused of
unnecessary secrecy and our
silence has been interpreted
as a deliberate attempt to,
create a conspiratorial psycho-
logy. We. have had better rea-
sons ‘than these for not saying
much until now. From the be-
ginning, the Committee agreed
that no pronouncements would
be made until we had a rela-
tively cohesive whole to pro-
pose. We further agreed that
announcements, when they
were ready, would be made
first to the entire Faculty and
not piecemeal to individuals.
Perhaps the principal reason
for our silence has been the
fact that, until now, we have
had nothing to say. Perhaps
an old adage wil! apply: ‘‘It is
better to remain silent and be
thought a fool than to speak
and remove all doubt.”

This is a progress report.
The Committee realizes that
more work remains and that
more decisions will be requir-
ed. There are a number of sub-
committee reports which will
require attention in the im-
mediate future. But we believe
that the recommendations con-
tained in this report are suf-
ficient in scope to expose to
the Faculty the main structur-
al features of the new curricu-
lum. The Committee realizes
full well that the quality and
content of what goes into the
structure will be the crucial
determinant of any excellence
it may produce. This will be a
matter for the entire Faculty
rather than for the Commit-
tee, A more complete report,
with more elaborate back-
ground explanations, is plan-
ned for early fall.

Someone has reminded us
that a text without its context
is a pretext. With this warning
in mind, we have tried to
ground our proposals firmly in
educational realities as they
exist both in higher education
in general and at Davidson in
particular.

As for higher education, we
recognize that many though-
ful critics now seriously raise
the question as to whether or
not the liberal arts college can
survive, much less prosper, in
the generation or so immed-
iately before us. The tremend-
ous quantitative increase in
public education presents ad-
ditional challenges. The ‘‘ex-
plosion of knowledge’’ has cer-
tainly complicated the former
simplicities of liberal learning
and has suggested that the tra-
ditional liberal arts may be
obsolete because such an edu-

cation may now be irrelevant.
In addition. we recognize that
this church college now exists
in a world of unusually rapid
social change and in the midst
of an increasingly secularized
society. Finally, we are. con-
scious, at least in part, of the
technological advances which
are beginning to change the
face of education.

As for Davidson in particu-
lar, we have been most con-
scious of one glittering fact
which we feel is of the great-
est importance in planning
the future. This fact. crucial
to our recommendations, is the
high quality of intellectual
ability among the students.
The raw material for an ex-
citing educational experience
is here. This conclusion can be
proved from data publicly
available. Our conclusion is
that, by the standards of the
very best liberal arts colleges
who already have them. we
can launch flexible programs
of intellectual challenge based
on individual initiative without
fear that we shall demand too
miuch of our average student.

Another aspect of reality at
Davidson involves the nature
and needs of the Faculty. It
will not be enough for David-
son to continue its compensa-
tion program into the immedi-
ate future. This surely needs
to be done, but the College
must also recognize and plan
for the professional needs of
its Faculty if the talents and
promise of the students are to
be matched by the Faculty. A
challenging new curriculum
will hold many and attract
others, but only if teaching
loads can be reduced, research
opportunities increased, and
exciting chances for perpetual
self-renewal provided.

These are some of the chal-
lenging realities that make up”
the context in which the Com-
mittee has worked and plan-
ned. The recommendations we
propose constitute our recog-
nition of these realities and of
the challenges inherent in
them. But educational com
mitment, if it is authentic,
will be not only to the reali-
ties but to the possibilities of
our age. One thoughtful edu-
cator has reminded us that
the principal task of our col-
leges is to educate man to see
reality as the God of Genesis
saw the chaos: as clay to be

worked; and above all to re-
cognize that the working of the
clay is a part of the reality:
Your Committee would like to
have us dwell more, on the
clay than on the chaos and
proceed to mold what is at
hand.

A curriculum is a combi-
nation of information, techni-
ques, and attitudes whose
proportions must constantly
change. But it is more than
that — it is an act of faith.
It is an expression of a con-
viction that the tone, style.
and skills connected with li-
beral learning can make one
more sensible and more re-
sponsive as well as’ more
knowledgeable. It insists that
a truly liberal human being
can be produced by the yen
for excellence.

In such a context, and with
such a hope. your Committee
is proposing a new curriculm.
acknowledging that it is al-
ways a means to an end and
that it should never become
an idol but remain a tool.

Calendar, Teaching Loads

The question becomes what
will we need to hold our own
in quality and still reduce fac-
ulty loads to approximately 9
hours? The Committee pro-
poses that we abandon our re-
quirements of semester hours
and set the graduation re-
quirement at 32 courses.

We propose, further, that ve
adopt a new calendar of 3
terms, to be arranged within
the traditional academic year
of September to June. Details
of such a calendar remain to
be worked out, but the Com-
mittee proposes a 3-3-2 plan.
Ordinarily each student would
take 3 courses in each of the
first two terms, and 2 courses
in the third term. Thus he
would take 8 courses a year

We will be able to change
the teaching load of the fac-
ulty so that about 22 faculty
members can teach 3 courses
for 2 terms and have 1 term
off during the academic year:
the other 67 faculty members
will teach 2 courses in each of
3 terms. This is not more than
a 9 hour load per academic
year for anyone.

Area Examinations

The Committee recommends
that area examinations be re-
quired of all students except
those in the Honors College.
These examinations must be
successfully completed before
a student may enter the junior
class. Students may take area
examinations at any time they
may be scheduled. If a student
should complete all area ex-
aminations by, say, the end of
his freshman year, he must
continue the core and distribu-

FABULOUS DINING

tion requirements unless he is
admitted to the Honors Col-
lege.

It is not anticipated that any
student will be totally prepar-
ed for these examinations by
taking the specified number of
courses ‘in each area. The ob-
ject is to make him go beyond
the course requirements and
obtain a portion of his learn-
ing from his own study of sug-
gested materials. By means
of this requirement, the Com-
mittee intends to demand a
breadth of lberal learning
which will exceed in scope the
sum of all the regular courses
he may have taken.

Core Requirements

The Committee recommends
as follows:

That academic departments
at Davidson College be separ-
ated. for purposes of delineat-
ing distribution and core re-
quirements. into four areas, as
follows:

AREA 1

LANGUAGE, LITERATURE
AND THE ARTS

a. Language and Literature
b, Fine Arts, Speech, Drama
Requirements: 3 courses in 2
departments,
least 1 course in group a. and
1 course in group b.

For credit in I a.. courses
numbered 11, 12, 13 (accord-
ing to the present curriculum)
will not count.

AREA ti

RELIGION AND PHILOSO.
PHY

Requirements: 3 courses. at
least 2 in Religion

AREA 111
NATURAL SCIENCE AND
MATHEMATICS

Requirement: 3 courses chos-
en from at least 2 depart-
ments.

AREA iV

SOCIAL SCIENCE

a. Anthropology. Economics.
Education, Psychology, So-
ciology.

b. Geography, History, Politi-
cal Science.

Requirement: 3 courses, in-
cluding at least 1 course in
group a. and | course in group
b.

GENERAL
MENTS:

12 courses as specified above,
of which at least 2 courses in
each of the 4 areas must be
taken by the end of the second

REQUIRE.

_year.

An area examination in each
of the 4 areas must be taken
before the student may enter
the junior class. A student may
elect to take area examina-
tions at any time they are
scheduled between his en-
trance into college and the end
of this second year. Grades on
area examinations shall be
honors, pass, or fail.

GRADUATION REQUIRE-
MENTS:

Thus, requirements for grad-
uation for all students except
those in the Honors College
will be: successful completion
of 32 courses which meet the
major. the area. and the dis-
tribution requirements. For-
eign Language proficiency.
Successful completion of 4 area
examinations.

A student may elect to ful-
fill these requirements by
choosing one of three tracks,

including at’ by a combination of them.

He may be admitted to the
Honors College. where parti-
cular requirements for him
will be specified by the Facul-
ty of that college. He may
choose to follow a course of
independent study in whole or
in part, electing those courses
in some areas, or in all areas,
that are designed for the in-
dependent study track. Or, he
may choose to take all of his
core requirements through
regular courses. All students
except those in the Honors
College will be required te
take area examinations.

Career Service Program

That Davidson College es
tablish a non-credit Career
Service program. on a_ vol
untary basis, for one term of
junior year. This program is
to be directed by qualified ad.
ministrative personnel who
shall report to the Dean of
the Faculty.

Foreign Study Program

That the full year forcign
study ‘program be continued
essentially as presently estab.
lished, and that a student be
permitted the alternate choice
of one term in foreign study
during his junior year, with
a maximum credit of one
foreign language course.

Freshman English

On arriving at the College
all freshmen would take an
examination in written Eng:
lish. A committee would then

The Davidsonian

determine those who pass and
those who fail. Those students
who passed would then be
come the responsibility of
every professor in the Col-
lege: if at any time a stu-
dent’s writing was deemed
unsatisfactory he would be
remanded to the remedial
program. Those freshmen
who failed the examination
would be required to meet
with members of the staff,
to submit written work as of-
ten as required. and to do
whatever outside reading and
exercises as were assigned.
The student would be releas-
ed from the program when.
ever the instructor became
satisfied that a minimum
level of proficiency had been
attained. The students would

receive no credit for their
work in the remedial pro
gram.

That the interdisciplinary Foreign Language Requirement

course in the Humanities be
continued in the new curri-
culum under the following
conditions:

That the Humanities Course
be a two year program, taken
as one course: each term for
three terms in each of the
first two years of college.
That the classes meet no
more than five times per
week.

That enrollment be limited,
as it presently is, to a maxi-
mum of 100 students in each
year, and that the present
ratio of 6 faculty to 100 stu
dents be maintained. __
That. the two-year work {in the
Humanities be accepted as
satisfying two of the three
courses required in each of
the following three parts of
the proposed curriculum: 1}.
Language and Literature, 2.
Religion and Philosophy, and

3. Geography. History, and
Political Science.
That opportunities for the

choice of the third course re-
quired in each area be speci
fied by the College.

credit for ROTC.
That. any ROTC program at
Davidson College be on a vol
untary basis.
That the College. take the in-
jtiative in attempting to se-

in several different commit.
teee sessions, and sub-com-
mittes had also wrestled with
the issue on several occa-
sions. It was the conclusion of
the Committee that Military
Science and Tactics, as a sub-
ject matter in a curriculum.
is not compatible with the li-
beral arts and ought not to
be a part of its program of
academic credit. While some
members of the Committee
also feel that Military Science
and Tactics is not desirable
with credit or without it, in
a church-related college, the
Committee has taken the
position that we would lke
for Davidson College to take
the lead in exploring the pos-
sibilities of establishing a
more efficient method of
training officer potential out-
side the curriculum than we
now have in the ROTC pro-
gram.

That a proficiency exami.
nation in one foreign language

be required for graduation. —

the minimum proficiency to
be set at the level of achieve.
ment necessary for the com-
pletion of a three term. col-
lege course (what is present
ly second year level).

Learning Center

The Committee recom.
mends the establishment of a.
Learning Center directed to-
ward independent study and
programmed learning. —

The basic purposes of the
Center would be to provide
expanded opportunities where-
by the student could educate
himself to a greater degree
than is possible at the present
time. The materials in the
Learning Center would pro-
vide supplementary work in
in areas or on concepts not
covered in normal classes:

furnish materials for remedi-
al work by which students
could make up individual de
ficiencies: provide opportuni
ties for independent study in

subjects or in courses not of-
fered in the regular curri-
culum: and help students pre-
pare themselves for area ex-
aminations.

Non-Western Program

The choice of the area of
non-Western, studies to be of.
fered at Davidson is made on
practical rather than theore-
tical grounds. It is not a judg-
ment on the quality or signi-
ficance of other cultures, but
a conviction that the use of
the English language in high-
er education in India and Pa-
kistan, the presence of the pro-
gram in Comparative Stu-
dies on Southern Asia at
Duke, and the training, re-
search, and experience of
some Davidson faculty mem-
bers make the choice of South
Asia a natural one for us,

Honors College

The Committee recom-
mends the establishment of
an Honors College for a
limited group of students who
show exceptional intellectual
ability and maturity. More
detailed descriptions of this
proposal have already been
circulated to the Faculty. and
only a summary will be in-
cluded here.

Students admitted to the
College would be retieved of
all regular requirements and
their individual academic
programs would be specified
by decisions of the entire fa-
culty of the Honors College.
The program of a student in
the College would formally
consist of both independent
study in depth and broad dis-
tributional requirements, per-
haps through the medium of
regular courses. Admission
to the College. which will be
determined by the. Faculty of
the College. could come at
any term during a student's
career, and any student would
be permitted to leave the
Honors College. without dis-
honor or penalty, whenever
he desired.
