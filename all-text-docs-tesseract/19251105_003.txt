| OF THE PEANUT PARCHER
It’s great to be an editor,
To sit up late at night,
And scratch the wool,
And shoot the bull;
| And write, and write, and write.

that creature that just passed.”
“IT hope you didn’t, m’dear,”

FIVE DEMERITS

| Last Saturday at the Home Coming
|Day parade Fresh Mug Mauzey pulled
lout his watch when the captain yelled,
“Mark time!”

“There’s always room at the top” yell-
led Vern Broyles as he opened a half-
filled bottle of Coca-Cola.

HEARD AT THE GAME
Fair One—‘Oooh, I'll bet that fellow
that calls the numbers gets A in his math
jevery month, doesn’t he?”

Last week a freshman got a lettter
from home telling him that if he couldn't
'make more than 1 on all of his work
| that he would have*to come home. His
dad wanted to know where the other 99
points went to.

WILT THOU?
Red Anderson—‘Sweetheart, you are the
\ flower of my heart.” And ‘she wilted into
his arms.

Fresh Pope — “Who is that homely
looking girl that fellow is dancing with?”

Fresh Biggers—“That’s my sister.”

Fresh Pope—“She sure can dance.”

“Excuse my dust,” said the goldminer as ,

Irate Parent—‘Hey, young fellow, set

what that empty quart milk botttle is do-

Smith as a fellow looked on his paper.

Soon the smoke stop-
Not a blaze was to be
seen,

In a few minutes the man walked out,
loosening his belt, and seeming altogeth-.,
er happy and uncharred,

People stood about, their mouths gap-
ing open in amazement at this man, On-
ly seven people fainted, however, when it
was learned that he was a champion fire-
eater, and that was the first square meal |
he had had in a month,

“Ah, good morning, Mrs. Blank. And
how is everything?”

“Oh( it is a grand time T have between |

Isadore—“Oh, Abie, do you know that
on Sunday night the fire insurance runs

Abie—Yes, and do you know that on
Saturday night the fire-engines run out?”

the girl who is doing the strap-hanger
act.

Hobo—“Dis must be a college town;
they ain’t a cigar butt on the street any-
where.”

AND HE FLUNKED
The professor told the freshman to
sign his pledge at the end of his review
paper, and he wrote Sigma Chi.

Purcell—“Here’s this quarter I
rowed from you last year.”

McRae—“Well, you’ve kept it so long
I don’t know whether it’s worth while
for me to change my opinion of you for
two bits. Lend me five dollars.”

MIGHTY WEAK!
Joyner—T thought you said an Irish-
man could fight.”
Crinkley—“Yes, I did; why?”
Joyner—“Well, Harry Vance, and Tom
Baker, and three other fellows and I just
licked one.”

The speaker of the day was Rey. Jesse C.
Rowan, ’04, president of the Alumni Asso-
ciation and pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church in Concord, N. C. “I wonder,” he
began, “if we have a conception of the glori-
ous opportunities presented to us here at
Davidson. Personally, I did not until more
than a decade after I graduated. I asked
people in Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
Maryland, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada,
Washington and many other state, ‘What
leading colleges can you name in the South?’
Everyone that named at least one named
Davidson College. It is up to the alumni
and also the students to maintain this repu-
tation that has spread throughout the country.

“Davidson College,” he continued, “is the
personification of Christian education. When
I say Christian education, I mean learning to
know and to love the principles of righteous-
ness as enunciated in the Bible and taught by
Christ. The things that have split nations
are different thoughts and ideas. . If the
world could be brought under the influence ;
of one literature, one source of inspiration,
there would be no discord. That is what you
are learning here at Davidson, to love and |

“In conclusion, I want to advocate my pet |
idea, a loyalty fund. This would not conflict |
in any way with any other funds of the
college. It would be only $10.00 from each
alumnus every year, I am sure they would
all be willing to give that much. It would
be used for three different thinks: to main-
tain the beauty of the campus, to be used in
pure alumni work, and for a_ professional
travel fund, 1 would like to leave a question
with you in conclusion, as alumni and stu-
dents of Davidson College, what shall we do
to make it the best school in the South?
The answer is up to you.”
