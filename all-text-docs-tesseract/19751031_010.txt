Schmader to assist

Janaro assumes position
as new girls’ cage coach

By DAVE WILEY
Staff Writer
Mrs. Rosa Lee Janaro, the
wife of Wildcat assistant foot-
ball coach Phillip Janaro, has
been named head coach of the

Davidson girls’ basketball
team.
Mrs. Janaro has had no

coaching experience, but
played for a couple of years at
the Philadelphia College of the
Bible.

Last year the team was
coached by three Davidson
students, Joe Duncan, Ken
Schmader, and Charlie Sla-
gle, but under the rules of the
North Carolina Association of
Intércollegiate Athletics for
Women, the head coach must
not be a student. —

The Wildcattes were almost
put on probation at the end of
last season, but were spared
under the condition that a
non-student coach be hired.

Schmader, who will help the
team again this year, ex-
pressed displeasure with the
handling of the situation by
Dr. Thomas Cartmill, the
Athletic Director.

“Dr. Cartmill told me last
spring that he had _ several
candidates in mind, and that a
coach would be hired shortly
after the end of school,’’ said
Schmader.

“When I returned to David-
son this year, no one had been
hired yet. He said he was still
looking into some _ possibili-
ties.’’ About three weeks later,
Cartmill admitted to
Schmader that he had no one
in mind. ‘‘He asked for my
suggestions,” said Schmader.

Mrs. Janaro was _hired
shortly thereafter. Schmader
will. handle the _ technical
aspects of coaching, since he is
familiar with the team and its
offensive and defensive pat-
terns from last year, but Mrs.
Janaro made it clear that she
is the boss.

“T’ll be in complete charge,”’
she said. ‘“‘Ken will run the
drills at practice, but under
my supervision. We do not
want any more trouble from
the NCAIAW.”

The girls will officially begin
practicing on November 10,
the earliest starting date

under NCAIAW rules.
Schmader sees that as an
advantage for schools on a
semester schedule.

“Those schools will miss
only a few days for Thanksgiv-
ing,”’ he said, ‘‘but we can
practice only a week before
exams come up, followed by a
week vacation. That leaves us
less than a week after we
return to prepare for our first
game.”

The girls will be sharing

gym time with IMAC and the .

boys’ team, which has already.
begun workouts. The guys will
use the floor in the afternoons,
while IMAC has reserved the
nighttime slots.

The girls, therefore, will

practice from 5:00 to 7:00 PM

each weekday.

Davidson Rugby Football
Club was dealt another defeat
this weekend by the Hampden
Sydney ruggers.

The teams were well-
matched, with Hampden. Syd-
ney outlasting the ’Cats for a
10-6 victory.

The first try put Davidson
ahead, as Mike Stick touched
it down for the ’Cats. John
Lovett pounded through the
Hampden Sydney defense
leading to that score.

But Hampden Sydney came
back to tie the game at 6-6
before the first half ended.

Ruggers drop 10-6 decision,
Begin 3-game home stand

Another try early in the
second half put Hampden
Sydney ahead to stay.

Davidson missed several
opportunities to score late in
the game, largely due to injury
and fatigue. Most notably,
Mark Connors, Southern Con-
ference 440-yard champion,
raced 50 yards before being
dragged down just short of the
try line.

Defensively the ’Cats
played soundly with Lovett
and Paul Henschen excelling
at the wing forward positions.

Three home games await the
Davidson ruggers after a long
road season. Wake Forest
University, Camp Lejeune,
and UNC-Chapel Hill will
meet the ’Cats in Davidson the
final three weekends of the
term.

Belmont Abbey tied the
game quickly. Perz stopped a
shot but could not hold on,
and the rebound was booted
in. The first half ended with
the score 1-1.

Blackwood got the Cats off
quickly in the second half as
he placed a perfect shot into
the corner of the net, with a
beautiful assist from Joe
Duncan.

About midway through the
period, Belmont Abbey scored
when a wing got by the
Davidson defense, caught
Perz off balance and slipped a
shot by him. Another break-
away gave Belmont Abbey a
3-2 lead.

Patton tied it up for the
Cats when he headed in a
corner kick, but a defensive
lapse cost the Cats the game.
The ball was in front of the
Davidson goal and Perz hesi-
tated before going after it, just
long enough to have it blooped
over his head.

“Our mental errors were the
difference in the game,”’ said
Barringer. ‘‘We played very
well, but a few mistakes cost

”

us.
