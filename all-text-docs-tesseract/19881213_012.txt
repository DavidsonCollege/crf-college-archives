From ALTRUISM, page 10

I read some harrowing statistics the other day in my
biology textbook concerning the future with regard to
‘feeding the world population. The book states that ‘‘the
first and most necessary step toward global prosperity is to
stabilize the population.’’ But, ‘‘even if the policies that
most tropical and subtropical countries have established to
limit their owh population growth...are carried out consis-_
tently for decades, the populations of those countries will
continue to grow well into the twenty-first century.’’ That
means that by the time the population explosion stabilizes,
we will be sharing the earth with between 12 and 18 billion
people, the vast majority of whom will be living in the
areas where hunger and other problems are already bad.

This does not presenta very hopeful picture. For example,
the country of Brazil will need to ‘‘double all of its food
production, water supplies, fuel, housing, educational and
medical facilities, and more during the next 30 years just
to stayeven.”’ And Brazil is probably very nice compared
to someplace like Ethiopia or Bangladesh. So it is easy to
see that the crisis. of world hunger is avery serious problem
(probably more worthy of attention than Star Wars re-
search) and it is only going to get worse as we move into
the 21st century. Being up against statistics like these, it
doesn’t even seem like it’s worth trying to solve the
problem, so maybe we should just let nature take its course.
Or should we?

This is certainly not an attempt to be another whiny
article complaining about student apathy, for I believe that
what a person does or does not do is his or her decision, but

I am asking everyone to simply ask themselves the ques-
tion “‘What constitutes doing enough in helping others?’’
(and more specifically, the hungry) with as much honesty
as they can muster. Is doing a CROP walk once a year
enough or going to CROP lunch once a week, or participat-
ing in a one-day fast for hunger awareness?

T hope that at an ‘‘elite’’ insitution such as Davidson
College, there are tons of people out there who would be
able to elucidate our duty to our fellow man (or whether it
even exists), because this article is not intended to state any
concrete opinions, but to generate them. Don’t let Christ-
mas break be a barrier of forgetfulness that yee you
from responding. I’m waiting.
