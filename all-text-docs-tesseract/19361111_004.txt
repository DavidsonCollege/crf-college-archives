CAROLINA TOPS DAVIDSON
IN HOMECOMING FEATURE

WY/ATES FAISON

They foaght ~- they last! That's
the story of Saturday's defeat at
the hands of Coach Woli's powerful
Tar Heels. Picking up after med-
iocre—performanées against Citadel
and Furman, the Wildeats were un-
fortunate enough to hit the Caro-
lina gridders in the finest iorm they
have shawed this year. They were
teally keved up to a peak. With
Duke facing them this week ina
“crucial contest, the question arises
as to whether or not they reached
their peak too soon. Will they be
in a spirit to repeat their gerform-
ance?
