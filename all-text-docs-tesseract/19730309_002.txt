Hall Plans Encounter Groups
For Three Spring Weekends

By MARK DEATON
Asst. Managing Editor

Dr. Meredith Hall will con-
duct three encounter groups for
Davidson students on the
weekends of March 23-25, April
6-8, and May 4-6.

These groups, designed for
between eight and 12 people.
are being funded by the Student
Government Association.

Hall, a part time Davidson
psychologist. feels that these
encounter groups allow par-
ticipants to gain a deeper
awareness of their emotions
than can be discovered in an in-
tellectually oriented college
process.

‘|. think encounter groups are
a helpful part of the college ex-
perience,’ said Hall. ‘This is

other places at Davidson,’ he
added.

An encounter group provides
an atmosphere in which an in-
dividual hopefully can better
understand his emotional life
as he relates to others and to
himself without a facade.

Hall indicated that he has
conducted many of these groups
in the past five years with
Davidson students. His ex-
perience has been that most
people find the encounter group
worthwhile.

Hall's leadership is focused
upon facilitating com-
munication with the group.
rather than by directing it
through gimmicks.

“IT like to think of an en-
counter group as a natural, free
flowing experience.’ said Hall.

swaemets Myths About China’s Image

Disputed In Whiting’s Lectures

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Asst. Managing Editor

Chinese-United States
relations was the subject of
Piedmont Lecturer Allan Whit-
ing’s address last Wednesday
morning. His enlightening
comments contrasted sharply
with the usual opinions one
hears on China and her policies.

In his morning lecture, he
outlined five main points of con-
tention between mvths adhered
by the American public and
the realities that exist in China.

1) Themonolith myth” or
alleged coalition between
Peking and Moscow is baseless.
according to Whiting. He cited
several Chinese attempts to
establish economic and political
relations with the United States.

Whiting said that the Chinese
accepted Russian aid primarily
because of lack of support from
the United States. He added
that the Chinese and Russians
are by no means on similiar
idealogical grounds, despite the

experiences which develop a
style peculiar to the particular
group one participates in,”
Hall added.

The groups have little direc-
ted style or formal operational
procedures.

“I open the group by in-
troducing myself and asking
others to do the same. From
then on, we just try to find out
what we're supposed to be doing
there. and go about doing it.”
Hall indicated.

‘People in my groups have
the right to refuse to take part
in anything the group decides to
do.’ Hall added. *‘That's about
all the structure there is to it.”

Hall's past experience in-
dicates that a fairly even
division of sexes makes possible
more varied expression of
feeling and experience.

“I hope to have many David-
son coeds participating in the
groups this year,” he said.

Hall does not believe that all
members must love or hate
others in the group. While many
such feelings might be ex-
perienced, Hall does not de-
mand any emotional response.

“These groups can have a
tremendous impact or very lit-
tle impact whatsoever,”’ said
Hall.

“A person may become
aware of himself either as a
deeply feeling person or as not
having any at all." he added.

“An encounter group may be
an uncovering of emotions {for
some, but I don't try to
manipulate a person's emotion.

‘I don't like to use gimmicks
to ‘conjure up’ emotions, but
many people do display intense
feelings in the course of a
group.” Hall added.

The groups will be in session
from Friday evening until Sun-
day afternoon

“Weill probably take time to
sleep. but otherwise they Il be

much

frequent “communist” label.

2) Whiting said that China has
been ‘‘defensive and con-
servative’’ with her war
policies and has only entered a
war when there has been a
threat to her security.

Shattering the myth of
Chinese aggression in Korea,
Whiting explained that China
had not entered the war until
North Korea was invaded;
China had previously warned
the United States several times
against invading the country.

In 1958, the Chinese
unilaterally withdrew from
Korea---an action that seems
curious for a nation interested
in aggressive warfare.

3) Speaking for China's in-
terest in non-aggression wars,
Whiting said, *‘The Chinese have
never sent a force across their
borders for this purpose.”

The United States, according
to Whiting, has been respon-
sible for much of the problem.
American hostility and military
troops in Indo-China and in
Taiwan have forced the Chinese
into a defensive position.

He added that ‘‘the in-
terlocking and locking’’ of
American and Chinese forces
have served to keep Indo-
China's political freedom sup-
pressed.

4) Whiting admitted that
there is indeed a good deal of
Chinese paranoia against the
U. S. Our hostile attitude
and aid to Nationalist China has
caused much of it. He cited
numerous specific instances in
which the United States had
(through the CIA) attempted to

Photo Club

A group. of Davidson
photographers and editors met
recently to establish a Davidson
College Photographers
Association (DCPA).

Its purpose will be to provide
a means for all students
working in photography on
campus, or interested in
photography, to meet once a
week to discuss needs,
problems, and ideas.

The initiator of the meeting,
News Bureau director Earl W.
Lawrimore, explained that ‘in
the past few years I've become
increasingly aware of the fact
that there is a lot of needless
duplication of photography at
Davidson.

“THE DAVIDSONIAN, the
annual, and the News Bureau
often assign a total of three
photographers to cover one

event. In many instances one’

capable photographer could
cover for all three publications, "’
he said.

“The DCPA will allow all
publications needing
photographs to pool their ef-
forts, while photographers can
make more money by selling
more pictures. We all stand to
benefit ."’ he said.

Lawrimore stressed that
while the main purpose of the
DCPA will be cooperation
among campus _ publications.
the organization can also serve
to) coordinate the
darkrooms on campus

upset China's domestic policy.

‘We were not only assisting
the Nationalists, we were per-
petuating civil war,” he added.

5) In regard to China's
possible threat as a_ nuclear
power, Whiting tersely
declared, “‘China has shown
prudence and caution in all
relations.”

Whiting was realistically
hesitant in his analysis of
United States-Chinese
relations. President Nixon's
trip to China has created a
superficial movement. ‘I don't
think there’s any deep change
of attitude,’ Whiting said.
‘*Change must come from the
United States Government.”

He added, ‘‘I think that there
are some real confusions in this
country.”

Whiting does not foresee
any significant turn-over of
China's” present political
system. It is basically an
agrarian country with 4000
years of history. China has no
navy to speak of and has few
real defenses.

Whiting commented that Mao
Tse Tung has given the Chinese
a sense of identity and pur-
posefulness. The government is
working for the welfare of the
society.

He summed up the country's
character---‘‘A China that’s
arrogant, proud, conceited--
almost American, you know.”’

Whiting, who teaches at the
University of Michigan, has
held numerous government
positions and has written
several books, including ‘*‘China
Crosses the Yalu."’

‘We would encourage anyone
so interested--student, faculty
or staff member--to attend our
next meeting. 10 a.m. Monday.
March 26, in the College Union.
We will meet every Monday at
10 thereafter."’ Lawrimore in-

dicated.

Debate Team
Successful

Davidson College's forensics
squad gained second place
honors in the 40th Annual South
Atlantic Forensic Tournament
held at Lenoir-Rhyne College
March 2 and 3. This tournament
is the longest consecutive such
event in the country, having
begun in 1933.

Points in the sweepstakes
race were given in all events
held: debate, radio broad-
casting, impromptu speaking,
oral interpretation, and after-
dinner speaking. University of
North Carolina-Greensboro won
the sweepstakes award.

In debate Davidson's varsity
team of William Eskridge and
Paul Mitchell were the only
team with a perfect 6-0 record
in the preliminary rounds. In
the final round they were
defeated by a UNC-Greensboro
team which had had a 5-1
record
