“Textbooks and the Living |

article by Dr. Guy R. Vowles|
in the April number of the |
“Modern Language Journal,” |
a publication of the National |
Federation of Language |

Dr. Vowles, who is professor of |

Davidson, states in his |
that

German at

opening paragraph “anyone |

in

who reads at all extensively
modern German cannot but be im- |
pressed by the linguistic particu |

larism of many authors, as well as |
by certain general tendencies which
cannot be classed as particularisms.
Many of phe-

these grammatical

nomena, searely touched upon in

our beginners’ texts and annotated |
books, are puzzling and = discon-
certing to such at least of our stu-
dents as are sufficiently alert. to
discriminatingly.” |

Use of Indicative |

In the remaining paragraphs of |
the article attention called to}
the use of the indicative

is
in con-

conditions, the choice of tenses in

indirect discourse, the use of the
conditional in the if-clause of an
unreal or “less vivid future” con-

dition, and other details of German

usage found in the works of dif-|
ferent authors.
