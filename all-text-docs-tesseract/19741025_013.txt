Vets Swell Ranks. Of Basketball Cats

Pre-season basketball is in
full swing at Davidson College
as new head coach Bo Brickels
prepares a team returning
four of five starters to meet a
rugged schedule which in-
cludes the top three ranked
teams in the nation last year.
Anticipation on the team has
begun to grow for whiat the
coaching staff believes will be
a successful season for the ex-
perienced Wildcats.

of this year’s team with last
year, coach Brickels com-
mented that they could be ‘‘fif-
teen points better.” Seven
veteran players are back this
year providing a solid base on
which the team can stand.
Brickels is also pleased with
the incoming freshman group,
saying that “they have been a
pleasant surprise.” -
Included in the group of
returning veteran players is
Steve Gacaire, who started
periodically in his sophomore
and junior years, but missed

Pending Reversal -

~ To the Editor:

This is an open, unabashed, yes, even im-
passioned plea to all of us associated with Davidson
College. A plan for what? We are bombarded daily
with exhortations to buy, believe, contribute, sup-
port, etc., etc. So what else is new?

My cause is the Davidson Wildcat football team.
‘This is not my only cause or the most important
‘one. Why not Davidson soccer? Rugby? Club foot-
ball? IMAC flickerball? Sure, those, too. In fact,
‘my plea applies to these and all pursuits--athletic
and otherwise--which are college-sponsored or
college-connected.

Okay, Liston, get on with it. Now that you’ve
mounted your soap box what are you going to say?

-Simply this--presumably the question is no longer
whether intercollegiate football at Davidson, but
what kind. We can feel, ‘‘Oh well this is.up to Coach
Farrell and his boys and the rah-rah 50’s types who
dig this pigskin stuff. If the team wins, we’ll start to
support them; but, after all, we are a basketball
school. Ho-hum.”’

But what if we reversed things? What if we felt |
our own responsibility to the Cats and coaches and

said, “If all of us can rally around this team, let
them know we care, and show our support for
them; then, they will want to win.”’ And if they
want to win and do everything they can to win, they
probably will win. And, if not, all of us can feel good
anyway at having done our best.

What a wonderful thing it would be if this football
team could be a catalyst in generating some good
old-fashioned school spirit at Davidson. It won’t
just happen, but we can make it happen-together--
which, after all, is what the word ‘community”’ is
all about, isn’t it? Do we really care?

As Balanced

By BILL LLOYD
Staff Writer

Following a 49-7 | fo
Lenoir Rhyne Saturday gight
in Hickory, Wildcat head
coach Ed Farrell still had
some reason to smile.

“I think that we are finally
doing some of the things that
we will have to do to become a
respectable football team,’’
said Farrell..

Statistics, though awesome,
did not explain the true nature
of the game, as was pointed
out by Farrell. “Lenoir Rhyne
capitalized on about five big
plays and penalties. They
seldom sustained a long
driye,’’ stated Farrell.

last year with an ankle injury.
Freshmen additions include
Mark Sumwalt and Kevin
Doherty, both of whom were
recruited, and Brian Coffey
who has reportedly been sur-
prisingly impressive.

” When asked to comment on
the’ schedule this year,

‘Brickels stated that, “Our

schedule has got to be one of
the ten toughest in the coun-
try. I don’t know of anybody in
the: country who plays last
year’s one, two,. and three
ranked teams in nineteen
days.” However, Brickels is
not dismayed with the
schedule, but sees it as ‘‘an un-
believable opportunity. It’s
the best possible schedule we
can have to prepare us to do
what we plan on doing, and
that’s winning the Southern
Conference Championship and
playing in the N.C.A.A. Tour-
nament.’’

Brickels sees post-season
play as not only desirable but
necessary, because it would
allow Dayidson to attract the

kind of athletes it needs to con-
tinue to be competitive.

In past games this season
Lenoir Rhyne had been

“For the majority of the
first we had their

iginal offensive
well defensed, but shifted
to the inside and we never

“fully adjusted,’’ explained
Farrell.

Offensively, Farrell was a
little more enthusiastic. “‘We
have been trying to build a
more balanced rushing and
passing attack.

“Though the stats showed

only 64 yards rushing we in

been primarily on. the con-

How long Davidson can
maintain that edge remains to
be seen, but Bri plans not

to waste any time in the six:

weeks of pre-season practice.
He said that the team ‘‘can’t
wait for anything to happen.
We can’t let a day go by when
we don’t think we’re im-
proving.” At the moment,
Brickels is convinced that the

while the ck was at-
tempting to pass,” hestated.
Farrell added, “‘Actually we
balanced out our offensive at-,
tack to about 160 yards
rushing and 181 yards passing.
This balance is what we have
been working on all season.’’
Farrell was also pleased
with the individual. perfor-
mances of Junior halfback
Steve Stec and Senior quarter
back David Harper.
Harper passed for 117 yards
and Stec rushed for 88 yards.
Davidson’s lone touchdown
came on a 10 yard pass from
Harper to Senior receiver’
Gary Pomeroy in the fourth

quarter.

Soccer-football player Joe
Duncan converted for the ex-
tra point.

Farrell saw no motivational
problems with the Wildcat
squad. Saturday night. “We
were really up for Lenoir
Rhyne and getting beat like
that has quite a‘ deflating ef-
fect,” he declared.

Farrell hopes that the Cats .
will be able to bounce. back
Saturday against -Hampden-
Sydney for homecoming.

Hampden-Sydney comes in-
to this week’s game with a 5-1
record and the best small
college defense in the country.

Hopefully some of the im-
provement seen by Farrell
last Saturday night will ma-
terialize and result in a Wild-
cat victory Saturday af--
