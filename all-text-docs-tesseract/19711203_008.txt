Author-eSsayist James M. Cox,

Wednesday with a paper on two
novels by Henry James, The
Golden Bowl and The Princess
Casamassima.

James attempted to lift the
middle-class novel to an, art

sciousness. Cox explored this
metaphor in depth, concluding
that the failure of The Princess
Casamassima lies in the fact
that James was so committed

kncounter Groups
Found Successful

By MIKE TANNER
Staff Writer

Vers much

times, an

Vogue in our
age which is putting
creasing emphasis on inter
personal and intrapersonal un
derstanding and honesty as a
possible step toward tne alle
Viation of some of the ills that
effect our society. is the en
counter group.

Although the ends of | such
groups are often hard to pin-
point, most participants agree

that the attainment of some de
gree of understanding of one.
self or of others or perhaps
simply compassion for the other
members are the projected re
sults.

One weekend this fall,
hall counselors Johnny Robin
son and Bruce Batten. together

with clinical psychologist Dr.
Meredith Hall organized a ses
sion for interested freshmen

The group met at Hall's home
from Saturday morning until
Sunday afternoon in an attempt
to familiarize the participants
with the encounter group con
cept through an actual experi
ence.

When it was over. the group
members, the organizers includ
ed, expressed hesitant satis-
faction.

They all felt that it had been
both stimulating and enjoyable,
but that inasmuch as the ses-
sion could inflict serious psy-

chological scars if mishandled,
it is not for everyone.

Batten added that in his un
derstanding, the session's pri
mary asset was in allowing the
group members to think and

express themselves as they
wanted, not as they felt) they
should

Dean of Students Will Terry

expressed approval of the ven
ture and said that he hoped that
in the future the college would
provide the opportunity for more
members of its community to
participate in groups of this
sort,

“The college has the oppor

tunity to provide facilities to
increase effective interperson
al Communication,’ he said. *'I

do not however, think that it
should be confused with an ef-
fort for Davidson to provide
total mental health service to
ill students. We cannot do this
and it is not part of our func-
tion as an educational institu-
tion.”

and could not accurately por-

tray revolutionists and anarch-
ists which are involved in the
plot.

Novelist Walter Sullivan, pro-
fessor of English at Vanderbilt
University, chose Under West-
ern Eyes by Joseph Conrad to
show this author's ‘‘politics of
despair.” :

He believes that Conrad ac-
cCurately depicts the anarchists

in his novel but that he has
littke sympathy for them. Nor
does Conrad have any kind

words for the morality of fam-
ily, church, or state.

Former Davidson professor
George Core lectured on Par-
ade’s End by Ford Maddox
Ford, in which this author at-
tempts to merge personal ex-
perience with the historical
events of World War I.

for SGA president and vice pre-

urer, class senators, off-cam-

Council. vacancies on the Hear-

Students must also elect a
president of the Union Board
president of the Social Council.
and editor of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN, The Quips and Cranks,
The Miscellany, and the Wildcat
Handbook.

Since the student Senate is
presently revising the SGA by-
laws, minor changes in these
dates and offices may be made.
Lear said.

One of the
present by-laws
ate is considering -erns the
date for elections. fhe old by-
laws prescribe that these shall
be held the second Tuesday of

inges in the
at the sen-

the winter term; however, these
by laws were written three
years ago when the winter term
was not split by Christmas va-

cation. The present calendar
clashes with the election pro-
gram because the Elections

Board does not have sufficient
time after the Thanksgiving va-
cation to publicize its event,
and also the election of class

senators would have to take
place after Christmas, Lear
said.

Consequently, the board has
deemed it necessary this year,
as last vear, to postpone elec-
tions until after vacation.

The senate is also considering
the manner in which such can-
didates as the editors of the
yearbook and the Wildcat Hand-
book are to be nominated. Pre-
viously this has been in the
hands of the Publications Board,
but it may be expanded to in-
clude nominations by the gen-
eral student body.
