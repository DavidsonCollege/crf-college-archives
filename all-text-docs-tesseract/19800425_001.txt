The SGA,this week endorsed
a positive checkoff for NC-
PIRG on student tuition bills.

College President Samuel
Spencer, Chapter PIRG chair-
man Susan Marynowski, SGA
President David Waddill, and
State PIRG co-chairman Elisa
Wolper will meet next week to
discuss the tuition bill checkoff.
The final decision lies with
Spencer, Waddill said.

A positive checkoff means
students wanting to support
PIRG would add approximately
$5 to their bills. Under the
negative checkoff used in past
years, PIRG funding was al-
ready included in the tuition.
Students not wanting to sup-
port PIRG had to subtract the
$5 from tuition bills.

The SGA decided that the
tuition bills of incoming fresh-
men would be included in the
positive checkoff. SGA senator
Dave Roberts opposed the
checkoff for freshmen, calling it
a “funding out of ignorance”

since incoming freshmen do not
know what PIRG actually does.

SGA senator John Eley said, .

however, ‘‘The exclusion of
freshmen would be an unfair
double. standard.”’ PIRG sends
a brochure describing its activi-
ties along with each tuition bill.
The SGA also decided to have
annual meetings with PIRG to
discuss the contents of the
PIRG brochure and to review
the yearly PIRG activities.
Waddill said, “The action

Frat members lose shirts;
Salesman flees with $3,000

A con man has cost unsuspecting Davidson students over $3000.
Posing as a representative of a South Carolina sportswear firm,
E.H. Byrd, Jr., took orders at fraternities and eating houses early

last month. Since that time he
has disappeared with close to
$10,000.

The money came from the

* Davidson theft and other North

Carolina Schools, as well as
$5000 he appropriated from the
firm at which he was previously
employed, Specialty Sports-
wear International, Inc.

Restitution may be possible if
the sportswear company can
recover the lost order forms,
PiKA President David Barkley
said. The company’s president,
Mike Lunsford, refused to com-
ment on the issue when contact-
ed by The Davidsonian. David-
son’s PiKA chapter is filing a
claim with the South Carolina
Attorney General.

Shortly after spring break,
Byrd, nicknamed ‘‘Ottie,’’ came
to Davidson to stay a few days
with some friends he had made
at the PiKA Regional Conven-
tion earlier this year. He “‘tag-
ged along,”’ Barkley said. Byrd
was introduced to the other
houses on the court; because he
offered low prices on sportswear
such as t-shirts and jerseys.

Housing waiting list 80 students long

By TIM WHALEN
Staff Writer

Eighty students were put on
the campus housing waiting list
after last week’s housing lot-
tery, according to Housing
Director Bill Bolding.

The situation is “‘much bet-
ter” than last year’s, when over
ninety students were on the
waiting list, he said.

Bolding added that most
dorm lounges will not be used as

rooms again next year.

Bolding expects the waiting
list to drop for several reasons.

First, there is student attri-
tion each summer.

Second, Bolding thinks sev-
eral people have reserved rooms
on campus as insurance until
they find off-campus housing.

Finally, students seem to be
more willing to live off-campus
this year than they were last
year. Only 75 people chose
off-campus housing this time

last year, while 145 have opted
for off-campus housing this
year.

The Housing Office is helping

students find off-campus hous-

ing, Bolding said. The Office
has a list of available rooms
that is revised daily.

Although Bolding does not
intend to use the lounges for
dorm rooms again, the rooms in
Duke and on third Little that
were formerly lounges will not
be reconverted.

Of the approximately 100
professors who teach at David-

next year.

English Professor Charles

Professor Norman Koller, Polit-
ical Science Professor Joseph
Retzer, and English Professor
Georgianna Ziegler were denied
tenure last year.

Economics Professor Randy
Kincaid, French Professor Lau-

Mark Davies, and French Pro-

Economics Professor Robert

have already left Davidson. -

Chemistry Professor Benja-
min Garrett, Math Professor
Kay Smith, History Professor
Maarten Ultee, and Philosophy
Professor John iter are also
leaving.

College President Samuel
Spencer ‘said the number of
professors leaving is ‘‘not too
large.’’ Many colleges are ‘‘ten-
ured in with little turnover,” so
that a significant turnover can
be an advantage, he added.;

Lloyd is retiring after 24
years at Davidson. He said he

Last week, Davidson athletes discus-
sed basketball and football policy. While
their views on the major sports differed,
all emphasized the gap between support
for major and minor sports. Now, the
athletes voice their opinions on minor
sports and women’s athletics policies.

Minor Sports: Insufficient Funding

All of the athletes considered support

of minor sports insufficient. ‘‘I can.

understand why people are upset,’’
Wilson said. Perkey added, ‘‘Minor
sports do unbelievable things with no
real funds.” All that many of the teams
need, Schuessler said, is ‘‘a pittance” to
aes improve their performance. “The
minor sports have a much better chance
at success at Davidson,” Marshall said.
“If there were small scholarships,"’

None of the minor sports at Davidson
receive scholarships, although they com-
pete with scholarship players in other
Division I teams. ‘“‘You could really be
good in soccer,’’ team member Chris
Moore said, “‘with much less money than
football receives.” ‘“‘I don’t think the
baseball team can be a consistent winner
in Division I,'’ Marshall said. ‘Some
winning is necessary to any athletic
program. If Davidson is going to stay in
Division I they're going to have to
supply us with the proper facilities and
funding to succeed.”

One of the areas of funding most
deplored by the minor sports players is
coaching. ‘“‘There are so many assistant
football coaches,”’ Schuessler said, “‘and
in minor sports there is no coach for
several sports."” Hoots added that track

Money is not the only problem for
minor sports players—other complaints
are less tangible. ‘“‘The only reason we’re
here is for basketball,’’ Moore said.
“There is a lack of genuine caring for
soccer in the athletic department,”’
Schuessler said, ‘“We don’t receive much
mental reinforcement.” Marshall agreed.
“It hurts the team mentally,, worrying
about things like where you're going to
stay on trips. You're hindered from
concentrating on your playing,’ he
explained. ‘‘There will be a student
reaction if something isn't done,’’ Hoots
said. ““Things could easily be pointed out
to the NCAA. For example, Davidson
does not have a legal indoor track team,
which we need for Southern Conference

’ status. We are supposed to run 6 indoor

track meets. This year we only ran 2.”

pleased with the growth of women’s
athletics, see many similar areas of need.
Publicity support for women “‘is nil,”
Ashley said. ‘‘Some alumni have no
conception that we practice every day.”
Care of facilities such as tennis courts for
women is “secondary,” Ashley said.
