Women’s tennis finishes tumultuous season

By PAM HARMANN

The Davidson women’s tennis
team finished its season last week
with a very successful 12-9 re-
cord. Taking into account the de-
cision to move women’s tennis up
to the Division I level, the season,
though successful, was disap-
pointing for many team members.
This is especially true of the up-
perclassmen who had counted on
having another national cham-
pionship under their belts. The de-
cision to move up to Division I re-
ndered Davidson ineligible to
compete for the National Cham-
pionship in Kalamazoo, Michigan
at the Division III level.

At the start of the season, the
goal of the team was to finish with
a 21-6 record. This included, of
course, winning the national
championship. Thus a successful
12-9 record is a bit disappointing
after such high hopes. Coach
Caroline Brown feels the team
would have cruised through the

national championships.

Once the decision to move to
Division I was made, the team
spent a lot of time and energy in
examining the decision and sub-
sequently lost some matches they
could possibly have won. The re-
cord was 11-5 when the decision
was made and Davidson lost its
final four matches, (It beat Winth-
rop by default, thus the 12-9 re-
cord.)

A further disappointment
came after the move to Division I
when Davidson was not permitted
to compete in the Southern Con-
ference tournament either. This
left the team without a tournament
or any type of post season play.

The final match of the season
came against Guilford College.
Davidson lost 6-3, but they put up
a good fight. Guilford is number
five in the country in NAIA Divi-
sion I, and Davidson has never
beaten them. It seems the only
teams Davidson can’t beat are the

big ACC schools like Duke, Wake
Forest, Chapel Hill. and then
Guilford.

Sophomore Amy McNelis lost
at number one 7-5, 6-2. Freshman
Marion Stone lost as well at
number two, 6-3, 6-7, 6-0.
Number four, junior Debbie
Podolin lost 6-4, 7-5, and number
five, freshman Martha Johnson
lost 6-3, 6-4. The only singles
wins were by senior Lolly
Johnson at number three 6-2, 5-7,
7-6 and by freshman Jane Price at
number six, 7-6, 6-3.

This put lots of pressure on
Davidson going into the doubles
matches. First and second doubles
lost, but the number three doubles
team of Podolin and M. Johnson
won 6-4, 6-3. Davidson knew it
would be close at the start because
Guilford is always a difficult
match, but everyone played well.

Number one McNelis finished
the season 10-8 and number two
Stone finished 10-9. Captain

Lolly Johnson was the best per-
former with a 14-6 retord. This
successful record is a tribute to her
concentration. Several times dur-
ing the season she was down 5-2
in the third set and’ she came back
and won. She is the strongest on
the team inthat aspect. Podolin at
number four finished 13-5, again
thanks to her ability to concentrate
and her mental skills. Number
five M. Johnson and number six
Jane Price finished 8-8 and 13-3
respectively.

The combined freshmen re-
cord of 31-20 reveals the excellent
contribution of this class. Addi-
tional freshmen who contributed
were Angela Rupert, Alice Stubbs
and Flora Robinson. Upperclass
contributions in singles and dou-
bles were made by juniors Libby
Sanders and Stephanie
Townsend, and sophomores Kris-
tin Malone, Lucy Spragins, and
Emily Berman. A strong number

Men’s tennis takes third in conference

By SUSAN WILKINS

First the bad news: David-
son’s men’s tennis team’s season
is over. Now for the good news:
they look stronger than ever for
next year. Now the great news:
Davidson, playing extremely
well, placed third in the Southern
Conference tournament, a mere
two points behind the University
of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and
only twelve points behind confer-
ence power Furman.

Big winners for the Cats were
sophomore Bill Young at number
three singles and the doubles team
of junior Trip Caldwell and
sophomore Jim Thompson at
number two. Ali of these players
won the championship at their

playing spots.

Young, a winner of the

number six championship last
year and two-time winner of the

NCICI tournament, was seeded
third going into tournament play
with a 5-2 conference record. His
two regular season losses came to
the number one and number two
seeds in the tournament at number
three singles. Young started with
an easy match against a Citadel
player. He won quickly 6-1, 6-4.
He then had to play one of the
players he had lost to during the
reguluar season. Young played
hard and won. Onto the finals.

In the finals, Young was up
against the number four seed, a
player from Appalachian State
whom Young had already beaten.
The ASU player came out looking
for blood, but Young refused to
bleed and won the finals with his
powerful returns and superb
ground-strokes, 6-2, 6-1.

and Thompson is usually mag-

nificant, but on Saturday they out-
did themselves. All season long
they have played well together,
but only had a 4-3 conference re-
cord due to several close matches;
they were seeded fourth. They had
a tough match in the first round,
winning 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.

In the second round, Caldwell
and Thompson were up against
the number one seed, a Furman
team with lots of experience and
were undefeated in the confer-
ence. Earlier this year, the Fur-
man team had trounced the Cats.
Thompson and Caldwell entered
the match confident and played
the match of their lives. They won
4-6, 6-4, 6-3. Another Davidson
team in the finals.

In the finals, the Cats had to
play the second seeded team —
ASU. Caldwell and Thompson
also had lost to the ASU team ear-

from 6-8 pm.

lier this year. But that match had
been close, and the Wildcats were
ready to play. They won the finals
with strong net play and spec-
taculuar serving, 6-4, 6-1.

The rest of the team also did
well. Thompson, seeded fifth at
number one singles, won fourth
place. Junior Hayes Dallas at
number two, seeded fourth,
finished third. Senior Craig Hall
at number four, seeded third,
placed third. Junior Michael
Meyer at number five, seeded
third, won third place, and
freshman Sebastian Koch at
Number six, seeded fourth,
finished third.

The number one doubles team
of Dallas and Young, seeded fifth,
finished fifth, while the number
three doubles team of Hall and
Meyer, were seeded fourth and
finished third.

end of the season was made by
Townsend and Robinson.

Coach Brown is extremely
pleased with her team. She feels it
was “without question the best
team Davidson has ever had.
thanks to the great chemistry be-
tween freshmen and up-
perclassmen.” A major highlight
of the season was winning the
Emory Tournament for the second
year in a row. It was a fitting
farewell to Division IIT.

The outlook for next year is
promising. Davidson should be
successful as far as the won-loss
record goes. Brown claims to
have lost her number one recruit
but has two other strong recruits
coming with state high school
rankings. She is looking to future
changes for women’s athletics
that must be made for Davidson to
be competitive at the Division I
level. Thus, hopes of an improved
women's tennis program help les-
sen the disappointment of this
1986 season.

Because of their fantastic
play, the Wildcats ended up third
overall in the tournament with a
point total of 55. Furman finished
first with 67 points, while UTC
was second with 57.

Coach Jeff Frank was ex-
tremely pleased, saying that
Davidson “couldn't have played
better.” He expects great things
next year with addition of sopho-
more Rick Hodge to the team.
Hodge has been out all year with a
bad knee and is expected to re-

place graduating senior Craig Hall
at number four singles.

Along with Hodge, Frank says
that the top two high school
players in South Carolina are join-
ing the Wildcats next year. With
five returning starters and lots of
bench strength, Davidson could
be creating a dynasty and look to
be contenders for the Southern
Conference title next year.
