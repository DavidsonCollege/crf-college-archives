Seattle Seehawks offer contract to senior Airial

By T. Sorensomebody

Senior Mills Airial gota phone
call last week from a very impor-
tant gentleman. It was a scout for
the Seattle Seahawks. “Mills,” the
man said, “you made it. You’re
going to play in the pros. We’re
going to beat the living shit out of

ou.”

Mills was excited, to say the
least.

“Well, they’re going to really
beat the shit out of me at first. But
I’m going to work hard all sum-
mer, and if I do well enough they’ II
let me stay on for the season, and
then they’ Il really start beating the
shit out of me. I'll work out, I'll

On any normal night at
Davidson College, a few
hundred Davidson students
and faculty members partici-
pate in the electronic revolu-
tion. Whether checking their
EMAIL or sailing into
CYBERspace for games or
conversation, Davidsonians
are privileged to have access
to one of the most hallowed
modern institutions of our
college: the VAX.

Recently, information has
surfaced leading to the
discovery that some students
are abusing their Pollux
Privileges. A group of
Davidson students have been
involved in a ring of smut and
sex that has been going on for
almost four years. At the
center of this ring isa mysteri-
ous figure known as Blade
Runner. Under his leadership,
these students have been
spending their Saturday nights
having anonymous sexual
encounters with unseen
partners using only their
pseudonyms for protection.
Each weekend the students
choose a different partner,
sometimes two or more, who
might be sitting only thirty
feet away in the computer

play hard, and hopefully, one day
I'll start. Then people from all
around the country will beat the
shit out of me. Have you ever seen
Rudy? Imagine him beating the
shit out of me.”

But Mr. Airial was disap-
_ pointed days later, when he got his
contract in the mail.

“Yeah, I was reading the let-
ter, andI noticed something strange
in the letter head. It said ‘The
Seattle Seehawks.’ That was when
I got suspicious: Then I realized
on the contract that I had to send a
$500 “lineman’s fee” to this place
in New Jersey. Then I talked to my
old roommate Philpott, and he said

he’d gotten a contract from the
Seehawks. For kicking. All the
KA’s got one. Then I was pretty
sure it was all a setup.”

Mills took action. He reported
his suspicions to the police, and
days later blue play-doh started

only requirement is a “test run”
with the Blade Runner.

The ring was uncovered by
VAX watchdog professor
Alexander McKelway. “I was
outraged that this sort of filth
was going on at a Presbyterian
campus,” he said. “This is
socially irresponsible behavior,
plain and simple. What about
viruses?” While he would not

safe, 90’s way to interact with
people. While our peers are out

Mills announces breakthrough publication

Professor on the cutting edge with feminist cookbook
The Feminine Mesquite

By A. Licks

Professor of English Elizabeth
Mills is proud to announce her
latest publication, a barbecue cook-
book titledThe Feminine Mesquite.
On Friday, she began a moving
reading with the comment, “It’s
about time women moved out of
the kitchen and learned how to
work the grill.”

Mills then read about fifteen
sumptuous recipes to her women
writers class.

Among the recipes she read:
“Grilled pork shoulder and
smashed weiner dogs,” “Susan

Libby's giddy.

Faludi Tutti Frutti Teryaki
Weiners,” “Catherine McKinnon
Sure Would Be a’Grinnin’ Muti-

lated Weiner Dogs,” “Camille Pig-
lia Smashed ‘Porn’ Sausage,”
“Glorious” Steinem Ribs (and
shredded weiner dogs), and
“Naomi “Howlin’” Woolf Burgers
(with a side of crushed weiners).”
Mills responded to criticisms
that her menus are overdependent
on hot dogs. Friday she said, “The
hot dogs . . . I just like them.
Morning, noon, and night, I just
find myself wanting one. I mean,
T always really, really want one.”
A touching tribute to Mills’
hero, “Sylvia Plath’s Favorite
Oven-Roasted Boar’s Head,” has

met some controversy, but Libby
stands by her recipes. “I usually
cook that one for my daddy,” she
said in one interview, “and he al-
ways gives me the tongue.”

Mills’ book has also been criti-
cized for the overabundance of salt
peter called for in many of the
sauces. Mills declined to comment
on this problem, saying only, “Just
taste it. It’s potent stuff.”

But most reviews have been
glowing. Said Julia Child, “Mills’
recipes are all right.

"Too many weiners, but all
right nonetheless.”

Another

relgious
debate
opens on
campus

By Barclay Turnstile

Recently a religious display
placed near Chambers sparked the
fury of campus Christians. The
display consisted of a giant wooden
cross covered by Roses’ Fliers and
a small bunny papered with pages
of the New Testament. Efforts to
uncover the identities of the cult
members were unsuccessful until
recently. Withthe help of Davidson
Professor Dr. Robert Ruth, the cult
has been discovered operating out
of Huntersville. Worshipping Jesus
H. Christ, the lesser-known prophet
from Huntersville,, the cult cel-
ebrates Easter by systematically
constructing rabbit icons and plac-
ing them in prominent locations
around Mecklenburg County.

“Finding them was arelatively -
simple matter,” said criminology
expert Dr. Ruth: “When the bun-
nies came to Davidson, I knew that
these fellows had left a trail we
could easily follow. It was almost
toooooo easy.” Mentioning that
he frequently drove by the mobile
home of the cult leader in an un-
marked car, Ruth said that he “had
been observing their movements
for some time now and was just
waiting for them to make a blun-
der.”

Cult member Martha Octel
states that the group is neither anti-
Christian nor Satanic. When asked
whether the group defined itself as.
irreligious, she replied “I’m sorry,
that is not the correct password.”
She added that the cult only wanted
to increase awareness of the many
different meanings of Easter. ‘“Eas-
ter is a time of renewal, and these

. fabbits symbolize that process.”
