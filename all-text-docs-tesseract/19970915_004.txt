A new building, a new viewpoint, and a set of new rules

By Laura CRAVER
Staff Writer

This week marks the 30th an-
niversary of the unveiling of one of
the most familiar structures on cam-
pus. The “thoroughly modern”
Chambers Building was presented
to students the week of Sept. 15,
1967, following a summer-long
renovation project.

Under the headline “Chambers
Loses Tombs of Gloom,” the
Davidsonian reported the cosmetic
changes and commented on the
“completely modernized interior.”

The renovations replaced the
steam radiators with a central heat-
ing and air conditioning system.
The walls were painted in an array
of vintage 60s colors, including mus-
tard yellow, lime green, and tur-
quoise.

While most of Chambers’ cur-
rent daily visitors remember little
of its past, they can all be grateful
that this most popular building was
spared the fate of typical and irrepa-
rable 5Os- and 60s-influenced de-
sign. Chambers has been preserved
as a stately building, well comple-
mented by and in accordance with
Davidson’s rich history.

On a more somber note, the
editorial page featured a letter from
a 21-year-old freshman, continuing
atheme that would prevail through-
out many more issues of that year’s
Davidsonian — the Vietnam War.

A Mr. Sigman had just com-
pleted four years of service in the
Marines, including a tour of duty in
Vietnam, when he began his aca-
demic career here. Few, if any,
current Davidson students have a
first-hand knowledge of war or the

subsequent stress engendered by
uncertainty, violence, and blood-
shed. Mr. Sigman articulated his
opinion of service, writing, “Atbest,
a tour of Vietnam can be described
as a hard job with conditions and
pay below union standards, and not
as a practical exercise in philoso-
phy. Now that I am at Davidson I
can formulate some sort of opinion
about ‘Nam...WAR IS BAD.”
Students today are very fortu-
nate to have avoided such tumultu-
ous times. But many argue the
possibility that such experiences
tend to make students more appre-
ciative and mature concerning their
education—but what a horrible rite
of passage. In fact, evidence exists
everywhere on campus that attests
to the high degree of maturity and
dedication of Davidson students.
Handling an issue which at-

tested to the latent immaturity
within each Davidson student,
though, the Davidsonian dedi-
cated ample space to deal with
the “freshman problem.” Fol-
lowing a freshmen raid on Belk,
“water stood as much as two
inches deep” and “wet toilet pa-
per, shaving cream, and confetti
littered the “dormitory and
grounds.” The damage prompted
the Student Body Regulations
Court to ask for an erid to dorm
raids.

Furthermore, the Freshman
Court passed regulations requir-
ing freshmen to “wear beanies
and name tags, speak to upper-
classmen, and create a class cheer
by Homecoming.” With respect
to the wearing of nametags, some
traditions die hard for Davidson
freshmen.

Spirituality and Service

By MIkE Brapy
Staff Writer

As service opportunities at
Davidson seek consolidation and
new foci this year, students and
organizations are making sure reli-
gion does not get lost in the shuffle.

“Religion is the relationship of
people to people,’ says Liz Clasen,
chapel committee coordinator, “it
is about treating people kindly.”
For Clasen and many other students
on campus, religion is one of the
major forces that motivate them to
serve. |

For many, spirituality and ser-
vice go hand in hand, “It’s a human
need to understand people’s situa-
tions,” said Brent Gilbert while com-
menting on how spirituality and

service mesh together.

For Gilbert, spirituality and
religion provide his need to under-
stand and, service is the means to
quench his thirst.

The chapel committee, coordi:
nated by Liz Clasen is an example
of one of these groups. The
committee’s purpose this year is to
combine Christian fellowship with
community service. The group

. meets every Thursday, and alter-

nates meetings between faith and
the organization of service projects.

Clasen says that the committee
already has a couple of major
projects in the works for this semes-
ter.

The first of these projects in-
volves spending fall break in At-
lanta, Georgia in a homeless ‘shel-

to seek a closer relationship

ter, working with the homeless and
manning soup kitchens. The com-
mittee also will be sponsoring the
Alternative Gift Fair, which gets

‘gifts and items for the needy during

the holidays. Lastly, the chapel
committee will sponsor Room in
the Inn during January, February,
and March. This project will, feed
and house homeless from Charlotte.

_ The group is also interested in any-

one who is interested in getting in-
volved. They group meets in the
union homeroom at 8 PM on every
Thursday.

Another of Davidson’s active
service organizations that combines

service with spirituality is ['VCF or -

Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship.

Chaston relishes helping students

By Davip KANG

Kelly Chaston joins the faculty
of the Economics Department this
year.

A native New Englander,
Chaston attended Rhode Island
College where she earned a B.A. in
economics, Graduate studies in the
same field earned her an M.A. from
the University of New Hampshire
and a Ph.D. from Boston College.

While immersing: herself in
applied economic research, Chaston
has not forgotten her first love fi
teaching. She has experience at
Merimac College and Wellesley
College, two all girlsf liberal arts
schools in Massachusetts. Chaston,
who “loves the tradition of a liberal
arts education,” knew she would
teach as she began doctoral studies.

“lve been given the opportu-
nity to do exactly what I set out to
do, and that does not happen to a lot
of people,” she says.

Chaston’s fields of specialty
are public finance and industrial
organization. These interests, which
involve government and taxation
policies, often provide ample op-
portunity forin-depth research. This
involves the application of eco-
nomic theories to the real world.

“T was very lucky to work with
(in research) very good people. I
would like to think that eventually I
will give students that same oppor-
tunity.” she says.

Dr. Chaston does not let her
status as the only female economics
professor hinder her work. She
views herself as an economist, re-
gardless of gender, while maintain-
ing a strong concern for gender is-

sues. She believes that the opportu-
nities available to female academ-
ics today are attributable to the de-
termination of those from many
years ago.

“T do not feel the difficulties of
being a woman in economics, but
only due to the efforts of women
who came way before me who had
it very, very rough.”

Chaston’s favorite part of be-
ing a Davidson professor is the in-
teraction with students. In two
weeks of classes she believes the
students here “certainly live up'to
the reputation she heard of.”

“The best part of what I get to
do is when someone comes into my
office with questions, and I not only
get to answer their questions but
talk with them one-on-one. That’s
the best part of my job.”

IVCF. The basic principle of 1VCF
lies in the relationship between ser-
vice and faith. For this year IVCF is
looking at more long-term projects,
interspersed with one-time events.
The group plans to repeat last year’s
projects, “the 30 hour famine” and
the gleaning project, which. both
work to provide food for the needy.

program are another set of organi-
zations, which bridge spirituality
and service. With, just the four
service organizations mentioned
that combine service and faith, it is
obvious that for a school of
Davidson’s size, that there is a defi-
nite connection between spiritual-
ity and service. Gilbert puts it sim-
ply by saying, “(When it comes to
spirituality) service is not an op-
tion.”
