In the midst of work, students still find time for community

Service programs at Davidson
provide opportunities for students
to help the community and the
world in a variety of ways, from
volunteer programs like Reach Out
to financial assistance like the
Bonner scholarships which allow
students to pursue projects of in-
terest.

Approximately 75 percent of
_ Davidson students have been in-
volved in a service activity at least
once. Some of these projects in-
clude yearly events such as the
Crop Walk and Project Life, the
bone marrow drive.

Reach Out is the largest orga-

nizer of service projects, acting as
an umbrella for many different
projects. Members of Reach Out
tutor children, recycle, offer free
day care, and do the things that the
community needs to function.

Director of Reach Out Samitha
Dontamsetty. says she volunteers
because “I just love to help others
because I have grown up helping
others and] feel a genuine desire to
serve. It really completes your
liberal arts education.”

A majority of Davidson’s ser-
vice projects are local, but as Ser-
vice Coordinator Catherine Turner
points out, “‘ Many students have
combined the Service Program
with the Dean Rusk Program and
have traveled all over the world.”

Reach Out also organizes trips
during breaks in the school year.
__ Davidson provides the oppor-
tunity for some students to pursue
service interests through the
Bonner Scholarship program.
Bonner scholars volunteer a mini-
mum of ten hours a week and two
hundred-forty hours during the
summer. However, many students
exceed the minimum.

As Assistant Dean of the pro-
gram Ruth Pittard says, ““ The im-
portant thing is not the exact num-
ber of hours, but rather that each
student accomplishes a certain
goal.
There are eighty four Bonner
Scholars at Davidson. Each stu-
dent is allowed to choose his or her

own project, and that project is
evaluated and updated with the
Assistant Deans throughout the
year.
The scholars benefit from the
experience by having direct con-
tact with staff members and the
community, and sometimes gain
some preparation for their career
goals.

For example, students major-
ing in education can get experi-
ence as a tutor. Students interested
in wide-ranging national and inter-
national issues have been able to
travel throughout the country and
the world.

In general, Bonner Scholars
do not volunteer just for the finan-
cial assistance. As Pittard explains,

“We see the Bonner Scholarship’
not as payment for volunteering,
but as a way of allowing students
who would have to work at a part
time job to be able to help the
community. It is a way of freeing
up those people who would like to
volunteer but would not normally

‘be able to.”

Cook adds, “These students
are not here to brag about what
they do. In fact, some students
don’t want people to know that
they volunteer because they don’t
want a lot of praise.”

A calendar will soon be avail-
able to alert students of service
opportunities and Reach Out will
continue to post fliers throughout
campus.

The second day of Davidson’s
“Women’s Weekend,” began at
1:30 on Saturday with a series of
skits. Each of the three eating
houses performed for a crowd of
curious freshmen girls, in hopes of
_ giving them a sense of what it
means to be involved in an eating
house at Davidson.

Warner Hall began the series
of three skits by explaining first
their unusual nickname,“Wappa
Happa” as the manifestation of their
vitality and spunk. They contin-

ued to describe their important
commitment to community ser-
vice, both in Davidson and be-
yond.

Warner Hall explained their
parties with one member acting as
a freshman, questioning a Warner
Hall member. The two girls then
“visited” each party. Warner Hall’s
explanation of their two casual
parties, “Crush Party” and “Oyster
Roast,” were of great interest to the
freshmen women, as the Warner
Hall members explained them as
great ways to get involved, make
new friends, and meet guys.

Included in the Warner Hall

its inspire freshmen women

party scene is the annual “Senior
Men’s Champagne Party,” which
involves Senior men, Freshmen
women, and the ladies of Warner
Hall only. The “Wappa Happas”
ended their skit by boogying to
“YMCA,” and showing their wild
side by performing the Warner Hall
dance to “Wild Women”’.

Nextin line was Connor House
with their rendition of the “Facts of
Life,” and “Entertainment To-
night,” including their own John
Tesh and Leeza Gibbons. The
Connor girls showed their style,
and their love for having fun.
Through their skits, they described

how each new Connor girl, after
self- selection next semester, will
have her own upperclass “big sis-
ter” to show her the ropes. Follow-
ing the pairing of freshman and
upperclass Connor girls is “Screw
your Sister Weekend” in which
each girl finds a date for her sib-
ling.

Rusk, the largest and oldest
eating house on the Court, took the
stage last. The “Ruskies” began by
acting out some of their casual
parties: “Cheeseburger in Para-
dise,” where all the girls eat cheese-
burgers ‘on the patio and jam to
Jimmy Buffet: “Destination Un-

known,” in which Ruskie big sis-
ters fix up their little sisters with
hot studs, keeping the date and
final destination a secret; “Heaven
and Hell,” and their annual spring
“Longneck Redneck Party.”
Self-selection will take place
the first weekend next spring.
Freshman. Ann- Strauser
showed much enthusiasm, saying,
“They all look like so much fun! I
don’t know which one to join!”
freshman April Edlin expressed a
similar sentiment, “I feel like I
know a lot about each house- their
similarities and their differences. I
really enjoyed them [the skits].”
