THE DAVIDSONIAN

I should start by thanking both
The Davidsonian and the faculty
of Davidson College for outlining
the problems many professors have

- with our fraternity system — prob-
lems apparently resulting from an
unhealthy distance between fac-
ulty and fraternities.

Fraternities are at fault for any
faculty misconceptions and preju-
dice. We expected our actions to
speak for themselves. The signifi-
cant service to both the school and
the greater community, the consis-
tently above average GPA of fra-
ternities, and the overwhelming
support within our student body
has apparently failed to broadcast
a positive image of our greek sys-
tem.

We cannot expect the faculty
to understand or accept anything
as foreign to them as our fraterni-
ties. We can no longer neglect our
duty to grant professors more than
“skewed perceptions” and “sound

bites.” We must convince them in
more than letters and good deeds
that our brotherhoods add to this
institution.

If professors believe that mem-
bership in a fraternity should be
universally granted, we must in-
vite them to our houses and talk to
them, not just as individuals, but as
representatives of our respective
fraternities and the system that sus-
tains them. We must convince
them that our practice of selective
membership ensures (much like
Davidson College’s acceptance
procedures) that we admit broth-
ers that will add to our organiza-
tions, brothers that have far more
to offer than a high tolerance. We

Half & Half

We all know that the optimist
perceives the glass of water to be
half full and the pessimist sees it as
half empty. This is all well and
good, but how about people who
cannot be labeled as simply opti-
mistic or pessimistic? How do
these people view the same glass
of water? I recently came across a
list in Wireless of various classifi-
cations of people along with their
interpretations of the glass (e.g.,
the feminist: his glass is more full
than mine). Reading that list in-
spired me to come up with some of
my own, so here they are:
Mathematician: Assume the glass
is a perfect cylinder. V = []rh/2
Statistician: The distribution of
water in the glass is heavily skewed
towards the bottom.

Antirealist:. The glass is only half
full of water in so far as we per-
ceive it to be half full of water.
Bill Clinton: “1 did not inhale half
a glass of water,” or “My glass of
water is also half empty. I

feel your pain.”

Party animal: The glass is half full
of water and entirely empty of beer.
Pragmatist: The glass is twice as
large as necessary.

Republican: The glass would be
full if not for wasteful spending by
big government on chronic wel-
fare recipients and public televi-
sion.

Democrat: The glass would be full
if the wealthy did their fair part to
help fill it.

Someone on a bad acid trip: Both
half full and half empty because
the water keeps moving around.
Ignoramus: What glass?
Hypochondriac: I\'m sick of the
glass only being half full.
Nymphomaniac: The glass is half
full. The glass is half empty. Ei-
ther way, it turns me on.

XYY male: The glass is half empty,
and that makes me very, very an-
gry.

Narcoleptic: .The glass is half—
Grumpy, rambling, senileman: We
never had fancy glasses in our day,
no sir-ee. If we wanted water we
had to make a cup out of our bare
hands after walking five miles,
uphill, in the snow from the house

to a well that was probably frozen.
anyway. And if the well was fro-

‘zen we'd have to walk uphill back

to the house and drink saliva from
the dog. And we liked it that way!
Thirsty person: The glass contains
half the water I wish it did.
Platonist: The glass is neither half
full nor half empty because the
volume of water in the glass can
only imperfectly imitate the form
of halfness.

‘Zeno: In order to fill a glass half

way, ‘you. must first fill the glass
one quarter of the way. In order the

fill the glass a quarter of the way, it
must first be filled one eighth of
the way. If we add 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16
+ 1/32 and follow the pattern ad
infinitum, the sum will never be 1/
2. The same is true for any
fraction of water that could be in
the glass. Therefore, the glass con-
tains no water at all.

Thomas Aquinas: Someone had to
move the water into the glass. The
cause of this motion can ultimately
be traced to a prime mover, namely
God.

‘Agnostic: I cannot say for sure
whether the glass of water is half
full or half empty.

Provada (official communist party
newspaper): The glass of water is
entirely full:

Person with multiple personality
disorder: The glass is half full,
half empty, half empty, half full,
half empty...

Anorexic: This glass makes me
look fat.

Hydrophobic: The glass half scares
me. : ;
My brother Eric Bean contributed
the following descriptions:
Pangloss: It’s the best possible
amount of water to have in the best
of all possible worlds.

Julius Caesar: 1 came, I drank, I
urinated.

ALE officer: What’s in that glass,
boy?

Easy-E: Oh. Never mind. He’s
dead.

Revision to Mathematician: The
volume is that of a frustrum: (2 pi
rl [1) - (2 pir2 I2)

Homer Simpson (after hearing
mathematician):
Mmmmmmmmm pie.

must convince them that exclusiv-
ity discourages apathy-and encour-
ages bonds of friendship and car-
ing. If professors can “wonder
why students have not attempted
to change the current system,” we
must convince them that our only
motivation for complacence is sat-
isfaction.

If professors believe “students
involved with Patterson Court seem
to be absent or falling asleep in
early morning classes,” we must
convince them that our fatigue,
more often than not, results from
long nights behind desks spent

ensuring that our GPA’s remain
above that of the average student’s.
We must convince them that our
social life in fraternities does not
detract from our education in
Chambers.

If professors feel our relation-
ships with women are “not neces-
sarily natural,” we should allow
them into our social lives. We
should convince them, as we
seemed to have convinced at least
one professor, that our relation-
ships are surprisingly healthy.

Professor Denham should not
possess an opinion of us based on

unfamiliarity. Professor “Beasley
should not need to ask for an invi-
tation to our houses. .We limited
our horizons by opening our social
doors to all members of the student
body. We neglected a crucial part
of the Davidson family, our fac-
ulty.

Invite professors down to din-
ners and cook outs. If they feel
comfortable enough, invite them to
parties. Enlighten them to more
than rumors and half-truths. For
too long we neglected our duty as
evangelists of a constructive, ben-
eficial, and vital system.

We cannot blame our faculty
for possessing twisted ideas of our
fraternities. We know our system is
not “fundamentally flawed,” and if
we show them the merits of our
houses, we can end all antagonism
stemming from simple ignorance.

Who are heros?

Michael Jordan was a hero.
At least he was a hero until people
turned on him. People wanted him
to quit the game of basketball. He
was so good he was boring. “Give
other people a chance,” we said.
So he did. He walked away from
the game and left it for the David
Robinson’s and Shaquile “I can’t
makea 700 onthe S.A.T.” O’ Neal.
People then got bored with these
guys and wanted Michael “God”
Jordan back. “The game needed
him back,” we said. So on Tues-
day night, 3.2 million of his big-
gest fans tuned into TNT to watch
him score fifty-five points against
the New York Knicks. And the
hoopla began; he was everybody’s
hero. :

Coca-Cola was boring once.

Pepsi was selling more because it
was newer and the “choice of the
newer generation.” Coke decided
to take Coca-Cola off the market.
Then, all of asudden, people were
enraged. We picketted fences,
made nasty phone calls, and wrote
our congressmen. So, Coca-Cola
came back and so were its fans. It
has been our hero soft drink ever
since.

I have a dog. She isn’t. my
hero a lot of times. She uses my
bed at home as a urinary deposit
source. She barks when I want to
hear the television, and her odor
contaminates my entire house.
But, to be honest, if something
ever happened to her I know I
would miss the heck out of her.
Even dogs can be heros, I guess.

It’s unfortunate the way we
don’t appreciate our heroes until
we don’t have them anymore. In
sports, it seems like you always
appreciate your teammates more
after they graduate. As for teach-
ers, you always look back and say
how wonderful s/he was after you
have had him/her. The fact is, we
take our heros for granted when we
see them every day.

Whether that hero is a friend,
classmate, teammate, teacher, pro-
fessional basketball player, or fam-
ily we still take them for granted.
We take for granted things that we
expect to see the next day. Then,
when they retire, move on, or quit,
we want them back. And when
they can’t come back, we call them
a hero.

explore the worlds of others. Ev-
ery student needs to do this.

The truth is that we, as stu-
dents, just are not taking advan-
tage of the resources we have here
at Davidson. There are too many
cliques and separate groups that
are making few attempts of ex-
panding. Communication difficul-
ties and sour relations exist within

. dents, as well as

the minorities, within the major-
ity, and between the majority and
the minority students. This hap-
pens on all levels, causing us to
neglect our resources and forcing
us to get less out of the Davidson
experience than we should. It
needs to change.

Our answers about issues re-
garding race, denomination, gen-
der and sexuality will be answered
when we explore distinct views.
So too will questions about
Patterson Court. Independent stu-
fraternity and
eating house members, have opin-
ions that need to be heard. Our

answers come from truly tapping
into all of our resources. They
come from us.

Weare all students at Davidson
struggling to find out who we are
first, but while we sail those muddy
waters, we explore — or at least we
should. We learn from those who
teach us in a class, and from the
notes we scribble. But also, we
learn from those who sit next to us
everyday.

Sincerely,
Warren Buford
SGA Vice President
