Belk Dormitory stands as a memorial to the
phenomenal success and character of busi-
nessman and Davidson College trustee Wil-
liam Henry Belk.

Armed witha talent for buying and selling,
the ability to take risks and a strong belief in
moral character, Belk built an empire of 400
departmentstores. He strongly influenced the
Charlotte area through the foundation of over
300 church buildings, public service build-
ings and contributions to colleges.

Merchants became vital to the Southern
economy in the years following the Civil
War. While growing up in this environment,
Belk chose his future career: “When I grew
up and got into business for myself I was
going to be a merchant,” he later said of his
childhood dreams.

At the age of 14 he set about fulfilling his
vision, Belk took his first job at the B.D.
Heath general store in Monroe, where he
worked for a “decent” wage of about five
dollars a month. At age 25, his responsibili-
tics had increased to the point where he was
in charge of ordering merchandise for the
store and was considered indispensable to his
employer.

But Belk didn’t stay around much longer;
he decided that it was time to go into business
for himself. With $1250 he rented a space,
‘bought goods and opencd his first storc, the
New York Rackct.

Belk’s success sprang from his hanpticn of
policics which were virtually unknown in the
post-Reconstruction South. He announced

Pop Film

that the New York Racket would accept only
cash, and he put price tags on each item,
refusing to change his prices no matter how
much the customer argued, pleaded, or
begged.

These sorts of practices were unheard of in
days when farmers were accustomed to buy-
ing on credit and haggling over the price of
every tin of biscuits or ten-penny nail. It
turned out that people did like knowing ex-
actly how much they’d have to pay for some-
thing, and Belk’s risks paid off: the store grew
to be an enormous success, making 400%
profit in its first year.

Belk slowly expanded his operations, cre-
ating a chain of stores called Belk and Bro.
Each store functioned on its own under a
trusted head appointed by Belk himself. By
the time of his death in 1952, Belk’s had

become “the largest family and management

owned and operated retail organization in the
country.”

Belk was a great philanthropist, and one of
his greatest contributions was the gift which
led to the construction of Davidson’s Belk
dormitory. The donation was announced in
1949 at the opening dinner of the Davidson
College Development Program’s campaign
for $2,500,000 (a not inconsiderable sum in
1949) toenlarge Davidson’s endowment fund
and greatly improve its physical facilities.

Irwin Belk, one of Belk’s sons and a
Davidson alumnus, addressed the dinner: “It
is my privilege to announce that the Belk
family and business associates are making
plans to sponsor the project for a new dormi-

William Henry Belk, a very, very rich man.

tory at Davidson College to be known as
Belk Residence Hall, and are actively
seeking the favorable consideration of
the several Belk store corporations in the
furtherance of this needed addition to the
campus.”

The gilt, estimated to be worth at least

from Merchant of the South

$300,000, was by far the largest single
contribution to the development pro-
gram. The building, which now houses
freshman and upperclassman males and
the college’s Residence Life Office,
remains the largest residence hall on
campus.

Good-guy Gibson makes surprisingly good Lethal Weapen

By FLORRIE SNIVELY
‘ Isn’t it strange that that at the
movies, the protagonist can shoot
everyone who opposes him (shoot
them dead, mind you—not just in
the leg), make off-the-wall witty
comments, eat a hot dog, and

come off as a really sensitive,

deep-down nice guy?

Seems like a complicated role:

to play. Clint Eastwood never

managed it. But somehow, Mel |

.Gibson does. Guess that’s how
-you know his character, Martin
Riggs, is the good guy.

Riggs’ partner, Roger Mur-
taugh (Danny Glover), is also a
nice guy. His kids bring him his
birthday cake while he’s in the
bathtub, and he doesn’t yell at

them. He’s gentle with Burbank,

his cat.

yo’

And he isn’t even espécially
fond of killing people (well, .ev-
eryone has a weakness).

Of course, even sensitive, nice-

guy hero types have their prob-
lems. Riggs is a little unconserva-
tive. He refuses to worry about his
own continued existence when
used as a hostage during drug
busts. He jumps off tall buildings
to prevent strangers from commit-
ting suicide.

You might say he’s extremely
well prepared to die in the line of
duty. Murtaugh (rather fond. of
life himself) doesn’t quite know
how to handle his new, possibly
unstable partner.

Atfirst he doesn’ tact like a nice
guy to Riggs. After a while,
though, he realizes Riggs isn’t
going to self-destruct, and their

The plot seems a little dis-
jointed at first, but elements
quickly relate. In fact, the ele-
ments tie together so well that I
suspect the plot was written back-

wards—from the final solution to —

the initial clues.

After the first forty-five min-
utes or so, when everything starts
to make sense, there are no real
surprises—but the movie holds
together anyway.

The writer, Shane Black, plays
a game of suspense with his audi-

ence and does an admirable job.

At the first shootout, you expect

the good guys all to win and the —

bad guysall to die. .

So you go on the the next scene,
expecting the good guys to win

obvious the good guys will win
eventually—after the requisite
car chase and the requisite shoot-

_ Out, worrying about when and

how generates plenty of interest.

What makes the movie great,
though, is the humor. The devel-
oping trust and friendship be-
tween two unlikely partners on the

‘homicide force could easily be-

come sappy; Riggs’ “insane”
comments save it at the last
moment. Riggs’ frivolity is re-
served for non-crucial moments,
and often serves to point up a
dramatic or exciting ceveloy:
ment.

Only one aspect of Lethal
Weapon was really bothersome. It

“seems a little too coincidental that

so many characters, good and bad
alike, had all been in Vietnam.
Murtaugh doesn’t act as though

he’s been in a war at all.

Riggs’ insanity is blamed on
another source--the death of his
wife. Obviously, the movie isn’t
supposed to be a heavy one, and
that’s fine. But since all the impli-
cations of all other elements in the
movie are drawn so well, it is a
little tough to suspend disbelief
over the one that wasn’t.

What, exactly, is the Lethal
Weapon? Well it’s hard to miss—
it’s Riggs. The allusion is made
early, hinted at once later,-and
then dropped completely.

Riggs moves away from being a
hair-trigger,and Murtaugh moves
toward it. The movie is about a lot
more than methods of killing.’ I
think it deserves a better title.

Lethal Weapon will be shown
on Friday, January 8 at 7:30 p.m.
and 9:45 p.m., in the 900 Room.
