bers then met privately and de-
cided to call back two witnesses.
Lopez was the first person brought
back. Carter Payne asked that the
message be replayed and asked
Lopez to explain his specific reac-
tion to the wording of the message.
Lopez said, “I was pissed off man,
just the way he called me nigger.”
He said, “I didn’t see racial tension
at this school, when I got the mes-
sage it opened my eyes that there
was a lot of tension at this school
that a lot of people didn’t see.”
Atchison was then asked to
answer more questions from the
council. He was asked what he
believed his staying on campus
would have on black students. After
a long silence, Atchison said it
would give him an opportunity to
convince them that he wasn’ ta bad
person. He said he would do this

Fraternities

By Towner Blackstock

The history of Davidson’s
Greek-letter organizations is cer-
tainly acolorful one, spanning from

* the ante-belliim days and the Civil
War to the present. During that
134 years, Davidson has seen fif-
teen national fraternities and at least
eight local ones. ‘With such pro-
lific organization, one would think
fraternities have been very popu-
lar; however, secret societies at
Davidson have had to survive an
interestingly mixed life.of rejec-

ion, opposition, or support from
students, faculty, administration
and elsewhere.

During the period before the
Civil War, the Eumenean and
Philanthropic Literary Societies
had provided the bulk of social.
interaction for the isolated men of
Davidson. However, the societies
focused mainly on academic pur-
suits like public speaking and es-
says, and really constituted an
addition to the college curriculum,
albeit one run by the students. A
social gap existed that longed to be
filled. s

At this same time, fraternal
groups all over the nation were
seeking to expand their member-
ships to other colleges. A repre-
sentative from Beta Theta Pi at
Chapel Hill arrived at Davidson in
1857, and apparently initiated three
students the following January.
These were not men disenchanted
with the literary societies. On'the

‘ contrary, two of these three were
presidents of Eu and Phi. They
simply wanted an alternative, and
they were not the only ones, as Chi
Phi established a Davidson chap-
ter in 1859. These organizations
grew to about 13 men each, but
they were apparently kept very
secret. The 1858 Betas were not
even mentioned in the first official
history of the college, written in
1923!

It was for good reason that
these groups stayed underground.

The times and the religious affili-.

ation of Davidson were not espe-
cially receptive to secretive organi-
zations, hidden from the rigid eye
of the faculty, or to their tendency
towards undesirable conduct. An

by talking to them and explaining
what happened in the trial and on
November 23. He also said. he
would be a responsible member of
the community and would work to
keep friends with the minority
students that he knew.

Atchison said, “My call wasn’t
directed towards the student body.
I feel that by it being played (at the
forum) I’ve been tried for spread-
ing racial slurs.” He said, “I did
break the Code of Responsibility
and deserve sanctions.” Atchison
also stated that by remaining on
campus he could go about recon-
ciling himself with the people he
has inadvertently hurt. He said he
would maintain a high character
and would be open toconversation
‘with others.

Atchison was asked if it would
be beneficial for him to be absent
from the Davidsoncommunity. He
said it believed it would notbenefit
him or the community because it
would allow the slander placed on
his character to stand. He said that

at Davidson, .1858-1938: A Colorful

1861 letter to a Beta’s friend read,
“wecelebrated our anniversary not
long ago in a grand style... wound
up with some choice Scupernong
wine with which I became glori-
ously oblivious of the cares of this
world.” Such activity, if exposed,
would have surely brought a score
of anti-fraternity rulings, and in
fact it did after the Civil War.
With the secession of South
Carolina from the Union, many
students purchased guns and be-

gan to drill. In April of 1861,.

President Lincoln called for vol-
unteers, and nearly the entire
campus left for war and home.
One Beta lowered the minutes and
constitution down the hollow col-
umns of Old-Chambers for safe-
keeping. The only Davidson fra-

ternities became almost instantly _

dormant.

Although some of the students
returned after the war and Beta’s
books were retrieved, the groups

were not to be reorganized right °

off. The faculty, in July 1866,
made it illegal “to form or unite
with any Secret Club or associa-
tion, other than the Literary Socie-
ties already established. Beta tried
to reorganize both in 1866 and in
the early 1870’s, both times to.no
avail. Chi Phi returned in 1867,
but became inactive within just
two years. When the Pi Kappa
Alpha chapter in 1869 was estab-
lished and showed its badges, the

faculty immediately disapproved, —

and according to the college his-
tory, “the Chapter cheerfully ac-
quiesced and returned its charter to
the home Chapter.”

In 1880, however, Kappa
Alpha established a chapter, fol-
lowed three years later by Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. Another frater-
nity, the Mystic Seven, colonized
at Davidson in the Spring of 1884.
Abouta year later, the faculty ended
the ban on secret societies, and
promptly granted rooms in Old
Chambers for use as meeting areas
by the groups. This seta precedent
for previously unknown coopera-

tion between college and student

fraternities-- and established a good
basis for faculty control of the
groups, if ever needed. One must

if he was suspended people would
say, “They kicked him out, he was
a racist.”

The trial was heading into the
early hours of Saturday morning
when the defense and solicitors
presented their closing statements.
Mimi Plauche stated that the so-
licitors’ sought a sanction that
acknowledged Atchison’s respon-
sibility for the phone message.
Plauche explained how Lopez’s
initial reaction was one of hurt
which ‘then transformed into a
feeling of anger. She said, “The
content (of the message) is neither
excusable or tolerable.” They
repeated their call for immediate
suspension and asked that he be
required to complete 150 to 250
hours of community service in the
fall. They also suggested that
Atchison undergo alcohol coun-
seling. ;

Brendan O’ Sullivan presented
the closing statement for the de-
fense. O’Sullivan stated five im-
portant aspects which he believed

remember that Davidson was a
strict Presbyterian school, with
drinking, gambling, cards, pool,
and (sin of sins) dancing all banned.

But in the 1890’s, the fraterni-
ties seemed to bloom and evenslip
from the gaze of authority. A
chapter of Kappa Sigma was es-
tablished, while the Mystic Seven
group had taken up the old Beta
Theta Pichapter. Big socialevents
were held about twice a year, with
some groups even holding dances
in Charlotte. Most entertainment,
however, took the form of “‘feed-
ers” and athletics. The Greeks
formed a Pan-Hellenic committee,
which studied rushing tactics,
which were at thé time completely
unrestricted. Some freshmen were
bidded (and initiated-- there was
nopledge period then) the day they
arrived on campus, anda few even

before! Upperclassmen could and .

would arrange to room with fresh--
men rushees. With such tactics, it
is hardly surprising that42 percent
of Davidson’s men were members
of fraternities in March, 1892.
There was, however, opposi-
tion to the fraternities from a few
parties. 54 students signed a peti-
tion to the faculty in 1894 calling

for abolishing fraternities, but

nothing came of it. Four years
later the Albemarle Preysbytery
requested “the Board of Trustees,
under the advice of the Faculty, to
consider the removal of the Evil of
Secret Fraternities from. the Col-
lege.” The Trustees promptly listed
that as “‘inexpedient.”’

_ Change didcome to the frater-
nities, but slowly. The Pan-Hel-
lenic council decided that no bid,
in fact not even the mention of
fraternity, was to be issued to
rushees until the Monday follow-
ing Christmas holidays. Rushing
went unrestricted otherwise, with
dinners and other entertainments
given by the various competing

' groups. The basis for Davidson’s

current system can be traced to this
first setof regulations. Yettheall- |
out efforts continued, with social
activities, especially informal ones,
increasing in number and magni-
tude yearly. Beta Theta Pi even
had its own tennis court for the

were the focus of this case. He said
that Atchison admitted his guilt
and was not forced to confess to
leaving the message. O’ Sullivan’s
second point was that Atchison
was on trial for this single call only
and should not be a scapegoat for
campus tension. ' He said that
Atchison’s action was not moti-
vated by racial considerations. His
fourth point was that Atchison’s
action was focused on one individ-
ual and the two have made steps
towards reconciliation. O’Sulli-
van’s final point was that Atchison
asked for an open trial because he
was aware of the problems his
message has caused in the commu-
nity. He said Atchison wanted a
chance to get the lines of commu-
nication open again.

O’ Sullivan said that the Code
of Responsibility stated there
should be “noexcessive penalties.”
Therefore, he stated. that the de-
fense believed that Atchison should
not be suspended and that the
council should impose sanctions

T

purpose of rushing.

By this time, the fraternities
were tired of the cramped rooms in
Old Chambers, and so was every-
one else. Because the meeting
rooms were amidst dorm rooms,
the “incessant” player pianos and
phonographs kept people up at
night, or from studying in the day.
The faculty and the trustees de-
cided in May of 1914 that the
downstairs of the literary halls, Oak
Row, and Elm Row would be
opened up for use as meeting and
social halls. By 1917, the halls
were occupied and furnished quite
comfortably, justin time for World
War I.

The Great War did not dis-
place the fraternities at all like the
Civil War did. The Student Army
Training Corps did, though. Atthe
opening of school in 1918, every
able student was required to be-
comean active duty soldier in train-
ing. Classes continued only for the
60 who did not qualify for this
enviable position. The comman-
dant enforced strict military rules,
including the restriction of rush,
bidding, pledging, and initiation to
just two days! He also shut down
the fraternity halls in October.
Fortunately, the Armistice allowed

‘the SATC to disband in December,

much to the relief of all.
But many students returned
from overseas duty, and the frater-

nities picked right back up in an

upward movement. Only. one
group; Pi Kappa Phi, folded during
the war; it had been established in
1912, but would returnin 1924. A
couple of local groups folded in
°22and’24, butthree others quickly
replaced them. The Bachelor’s
Club, founded in 1913, petitioned
PhiGamma Delta, and was granted
acharter in 1923. With all of this
growth, many changes were
wrought.

Rushing took another turn,
when the bidding date moved back

to December 15 in 1923. Every

following year, the date moved
further and further up in order to
make room for a longer pledge
period. The rooming of freshmen
and upperclassmen ended at the
same time, which was timely con-

that are completely just. “He real-
ized he transgressed the spirit of
the Code. We need to teach him
tolerance, “ said O’Sullivan. He
said, “Kicking him out won’t ac-
complish this, it won’t benefit Phil
or the community.”

O’Sullivan said that the de-
fense believed that Atchison should
have to learn responsibility. He
then listed six sanctions that he
believed Atchison should receive.
These penalties were the same ones
that the council decided to enjoin
upon Atchison, except that the
Council added more length to his
social and alcohol probation and
recommended that he write the two
articles for the Davidsonian.

The public part of the trial
concluded at 12:45am early Satur-
day morning after O’Sullivan’s
closing statement.

History

sidering thatOld Chambers burned
tothe ground in 1921. Inthe social
scene, the oration of the big week-
ends finally ended, and dances took
their place, becoming more and
more common as the twenties
progressed. But perhaps the big-
gest change came with the deci-
sion to let the groups build their

’ own houses. Well, sort of.

Allof the fraternities wentnuts
when they heard they could move
into their own houses. Many al-
ready ate in local boarding houses,
so this was very well received,
especially when the faculty an-
nounced in May of ’24 that the old
halls had to be empty in one year.
But then in’ the fall, the faculty
limited board in the houses to jun-
iors and seniors and required the
houses to be on Davidson property
and 75 percent of the construction
money to be held when building
commenced. Then the trustees said
they only needed 60 percent of the
funds if the building would be lived
in, but that they could borrow
money for a social and meeting
hall witha topcost of $5000. In the
meantime, most fraternities rented
out whole boarding houses, which
soon proved expensive, rowdy, and
tiresome after a couple of years.
Needless to say, everybody grew
tired of the division and the indeci-
sion, yet the wait proved worth-
while.

The Board of Trustees adopted
a plan in February, 1928, to build
and rent houses to the fraternities
on land situated between Concord
Road and the gym. The college
would own the property, the houses
would bein the same style of archi-
tecture (with minor differences),
and there would be no real dining
orliving facilities. Although noth-
ing shocking to today’s student,
the idea proved innovative to the.
collegiate world of the time. Many
advantages sprang from the ar-
rangement, All students lived in
the dorms and the fraternities were
allinclose proximity, which proved
to keep relations amiable and
improve Davidson spirit. Plus, the

fraternities were nearly debt-free;
