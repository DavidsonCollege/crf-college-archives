A ‘REVIEW
By DON PARMAN

If you get to this week's
Hungry d before the show
starts, .it wlil look like a lot
of the Hungry d's that you
have seen before. |

To look at the stage you
will have to suspect that the
Argir Group will be a lot
like all of the other groups
that you have heard at the
‘Hungry ad. Three or four
guitars and a tamborine.

Education ‘Stifles’ Potential Teachers

By ALEC HOON
Staff Writer

“The American education-
al -system: stifles those in-
terested in teaching,’’ Leo
McLaughlin told Davidson
students on Tuesday, Nov
ember 3rd.

McLaughlin, who recently
became Director of Fresh-
man Studies at J. C. Smith
University, criticised the
length of time a_ student
spends in the educational
process, saying that the stu-
Ments, whom he termed
(“young adults’ wére treated
as ‘‘second-class citizen.”

Focusing in on the black
educational ‘experience, he
emphasized that “it wi:l be
a great day when black col-

ESP Talks
On Monday

Dr. J. B. Mhine, an au-
thority on  parasychology,
the study of ESP and relat-
ed psychic phenomena, will
give two talks on the sub-
jeet Monday.

Rhine will deliver both
lectures in Hodson Hall, the
first at 10 a.m. and the se-
cond at 8:15 p.m.

A retired professor of
parapsychology at Duke,
Rhine now works for the
(Foundation for Research on
the Nature of Man, where
he heads the parapsychology
branch.

He is the originator and
co-editor of the journal of
Parapsychology and _ has
written a number of sub-
jects on the subject.

Rhine ‘will be accompanied
by his wife, also an expert
in parapsychology, who will
participate in her husband's

‘formal presentation and in
the discussion which will fol-
low.

(Mrs. ‘Rhine has also writ-
ten on parapsychology, in-
cluding two books, ‘‘ESP In
-Life-and-Lab"and-‘“‘Hidden
Channels of the Mind."’

The lectures are sponsor-
ed by the Psychology Club.

leges stop imitating the mis-
Wakes that whites — have
made, and begin to show a
real educational process.”

These statements were
part of the lecture that Mc-
Laughlin. gave on the sub-
ject of the President's Com-
mission_on Campus Unrest,
known as ‘“Phe Scranton Re-
port.”’

He used the introduction,
second, and third chapters
of the Scranton Report as a
‘ake-off point for giving his
opinion of the American edu-
cational system today.

The introduction was char-
acterized as a plea for un-
derstanding. He. said that we

should) examine our own
fears as a_ solution to the
situation, !

“Our problem might well
be to fiid ways to use our
fears for constructive - pur-
poses” in resolving the dile-
mma of student unrest, he
stated.

Turning to the second
chapter, he summarized
what the Report found to be
the causes of the unrest on
campuses today. The pri-
mary cause, the Report in-
dicated, was the formation
of a new youth culture.

The »Commission added
that the issues of race, the
War, and personal freedoms
were contributing factors to
campus unrest.

(McLaughlin noted that one
cause that the report reject-

oxalarge our

ed was that the disturbances
were largely caused by out-
side agitators which many
people suspect.

‘He stressed the: fact that
“much good can be done by
more understanding ... . It
can reduce the clashes and
violence.”’

“We must strive to en-
own perspective
as we try to enlarge the
perspective of others,” he
said.

An interesting point that
(McLaughlin mentioned was
that the Report stated that
those principally ‘involved in
campus’ disturbances and
confrontations were the sons
and daughters of affluent
parents.

He said that ‘‘students
were trying to live what
their parents preached" and
to avoid ‘‘the ‘good life of
the suburbs’ which meant
more time to the job, and
less time to the family.”

McLaughlin went on to
say that the Commission
stressed the importance of
teaching. That the degrad-
ing attitude towards the -pro-
fession of teaching must be
altered was his strong con-

viction. ey,

“If one doesh't publish,
the tendency to get fired is
good at the higher educa>
tional level’ was one of~his
barbed criticisms of tthe
whole educational system.

experience was his present

cencern at J.C. Smith Uni-
versity (a college primarily
for blacks), he chose to con-
clude his talk with a few
remarks on the third chapt-
er of the Report which dealt
specifically with the black
student movement. :

Quoting the Commission,
he said “Black pride . .
and black survival are. not
idealistic (slogans) to black
students. They give mean-
ing to the black struggle."’

Whites must, he said, try
to understand the meaning
of ithe bjaek— experience
through love, since they are
incapable of directly  ex-
periencing it.

McLaughlin-remarked that
he had come to Smith Uni-
versity. to ‘' learn as much
as to teach."

A brief question and an-
Swer period followed in
which he affirmed his belief
that” commissions such as
the Scranton, Commissign
should” continue. to exist,
even it they seemed to do
' little apparent good.

gry d and they're right.

The group is named for
leader Fred, Argir, who com-
bines with’ Betsy Bernard
and David Kendrick to
make beautiful music.

The group plays original
material, not the kind of
stuff that you know ‘and can
sing along with back at your
table. That's nice because
they can sing it a lot better
than you or I.

Argir and Miss Bernard do
‘the singing for all of the
numbers: with Miss Bernard
handling most of the solo
work. .She has a beautiful
voice, not quite the same
as Judy Collins’ but the
similarity is there. Miss
Bernard uses her voice as
an instrument better’ than
‘anyone since ‘the Rotary
Connection was here.

If you're. not completely
engulfed in the sound of the
group you can listen to and
appreciate the words of the
songs. All the notes are in
the right places. Even with-
out the drums, Kendrick’s
bass play maintains the
rhythm.

The songs take you on the
travels of the group across
the country. Fyom Boston
to Alaska to Hibbing, Min-
nesotia’s' Dan the Dinosaur
Man.

‘Miss Berrard and Argir
both have excellent voices
for their solo work, and
sound good together too. In
the numbers that the two
sing ‘together her. voice
tends. to dominate as Argir’s
is a little more mellow.

The group is fun to listen
to when they play songs for
fun like “Tutty Fruity’ Sali-
ca_ Pill Rag.’’ Miss Bernard
is without a doubt the best
kazooist ‘to ‘hit Davidson
since the invention of the
instrument.

Come out and listen -to-
night or tomorrow night in
the Morrison Room; you'll
like it.
