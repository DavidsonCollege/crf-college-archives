flutes for humanity

By Wes ey H. GoLpsBerry

World-renowned flutist Wissam Boustany
and piano accompanist Greg McCallum gave one
of the year’s longest concerts in Hodson Hall on
Monday night, March 23. The concert served as a
tantalizing hors d’oeuvre before yesterday’s
Amadeus Trio performance.

The program opened
with a performance of.
Mozart’s Sonata in B-flat Ma-
jor, K.317. Boustany’s over-
whelming profiency emerged
in his playing of this difficult
work, serving as a prime ex-
ample of the amount of virtu-
osity that Mozart’s concerto
repértoire-can demand. His
completion of the piece was
met by a warm ovation from
the modest yet appreciative
crowd.

The next piece,
Hamilton Harty’s (1879-
1941) “In Ireland,” provided
a welcome contrast with its
idiomatic jig-like passages. Boustany added much
stylistic flair to this pleasant work. Cecile
Chaminade’s (18571944) Concertino, Op. 107
could be described as “‘cutesy,” but did not at all
undermine the soloist’s capabilities. This piece

_ utilized several very ornate and difficult flour-
_ ishes, all of which Boustany played flawlessly.

The twentieth century trend continued with Eldin

- Burton’s (1913-1985) Sonatina, whose last move-

ment, Allegro giocoso quasi fandango, was quite
challenging. Boustany had clearly mastered the
“quasi fandango” idiom.

Following intermission, the soloist tackled
Tarek Younis’s (b. 1976) “Rising from the Ashes,”

@ Wissam Boustany

apiece written for and first performed by Boustany
on his tour of the United States. Whatever was
rising from the ashes in this song definitely took its
time doing so, as this piece seemed to last for
almost fifteen minutes. Fortunately; Younis’s
composition could have been less palatable, as it
made skillful use of parallel fifths and traditional
Middle Eastern melodic motifs.

Schubert’s Variations on Trockne Blumen
rounded out the concert. Itis
difficult to say exactly how
many variations there were,

- but there were more than
enough to satisfy. By the
‘time the concert had reached
its bitter end, I found myself
dazed and had begun think-
ing in a language made up
solely of- flute noises.
Boustany and McCallum
earned a well-deserved cur-
tain call, the audience clearly
impressed with the soloist’s
surpassing endurance.

Wissam Boustany

was born in Lebanon and
moved to England in 1977
where he studied flute at several music schools.

Within six years he had won several competitions

and was performing recitals worldwide. Boustany
is also the founder of “Towards Humanity,” an
organization decidated to helping communities
suffering from the aftermath of war. His experi-
ences of war in Lebanon have led to his humanitar-
ian philosophy, which he shares through his mu-
sic: “Music opens the Doors of Inspiration and

helps us reflect on our Common Humanity.” As a

wise man once said, “True dat.”

Boustany’s stellar performance featured a

wide range of repertoire and performance styles, a

most unique gift for the campus at large.
