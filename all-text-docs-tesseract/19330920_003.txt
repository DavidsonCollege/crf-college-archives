Executive Committee and Alumni |
Council Met |

Over three hundred and fifty alumni |
returned to the Davidson campus for|
the Ninety-seventh Commencement ¢x-)
ercises of the institution. The exercises |
were held on Monday and Tuesday, |
the 29th and 30th of May.

Alumni activities began with the!
meeting of the Executive Committee |
of the Alumni Council, which met at |
five o'clock on Monday afternoon. |
That night at eight, the Alumni Coun-|
cil met and reports by the various offi- |
cers were made, and the recommenda- |

tions of the Executive Committee
were brought before the body and
voted on. The attendance at this

meeting was rather large, considering
the situation in which the Alumni As-
sociation was.

At ten o'clock Tuesday morning,
members of the Alumni Association
met in Chambers Building and divided |
into groups which were led by mem-
bers of the graduating class. The va-
rious groups discussed different angles
of college life, such as athletics, re-
ligion on the Davidson campus, social
life, and publications. Following these
meetings the whole body convened in
the auditorium, where reports from
the individual conferences were made.

Dr. Ben R. Lacy and Mr. Jos. B.
Johnston were re-elected president
and vice-president of the Alumni As-
sociation. S. Clay Williams, Dr. W. T.
Thompson, and Mr. Scott Candler were
elected alumni trustees following the
-presentation-—of—_twelve—names to the
association. Toe—the Athletic Council
were elected L. Richardson, Dr. Oren
Moore, Mr, L. H. Wilkinson, with Mr.
I. P. Graham as alternate. Six new
members of the Alumni Council were
chosen. They were J. R. McGregor,
Norman Johnson, Eugene Neisler, R.
E. Abell, McDowell Reid, and Ernest
Milton.

Following the adjournment of this
meeting, the entire body retired to the
banquet hall for lunch, where a few
talks were made, gifts presented, and
food consumed.

Alumni Meet at
Virginia Hotel

Fifteen Davidson men who were in
Massanetta Springs, Va., this summer
gathered at an informal luncheon on
July 14, in the dining room of the
Massanetta Springs Hotel. These men
were in the resort either as members
of the conference faculty or in con-
nection with the management of the
hotel. The Wildcats entertained the
public in the dining hall with David-
son songs and yells, and an enthusiastic
spirit was manifested. Representatives
of classes from '05 through °'36 were
present at the party.

05; J. J. Murray, ’09; Robert W.
Miles, ‘11; Z. V. Roberson, ‘14; D. T.

If the alumni page is to be a
success this year, the alumni
must support it by making con-
tributions to it. If you know of
anything that has happened to
a Davidson man, let us know
bout it. If thing has hap-
pened to you, don’t be bashful—
write the secretary about it, so
that others who are interested
may know.

Dr, Lingle professed a great deal of
interest in the prehistoric paintings in
the cave’ of Altamira, probably the
most striking single object to be seen
in Spain.

Journeying next to the Scandinavian
Peninsula, they spent some time
among the peoples of Denmark, Nor-
way, Sweden, and England. Dr. Lingle
was impressed especially with two
characteristics of these-northern peo-
Their desire for good literature
and reading seems’ to be universal, and
bookstores can be seen everywhere.
The economic, social, cultural and
moral plane must be remarkably high.
Dr. Lingle reports that he saw not one
beggar during his entire stay in this
region.

In Copenhagen they were enter-
tained by the American Minister, Hon.
Ruth Bryan Owen, whose son once
studied at Davidson and is now a
writer of note.

In Finland the Lingles visited the
famous Russian monastery of Valamo
in Lake Ladoga on the Russian border,
returning by hydroplane from Finland
to Stockholm.

Germany was the next place on their
route, and they spent a ore observ-
ing political conditions srider the Hit-
ler regime. Young Nazis seemed per-
fectly willing to talk politics with
them, Dr. Lingle reports, but they all
seem to have one line—“ Hitler— the
Savior—Hitler, the only way.” All
other people, if they have any ideas
on the matter, fear to. speak them.

| Positions in Roosevelt’s Re-
covery Administration

Davidson men have played a large
part in President Roosevelt’s recovery
act; how large a part may never be
known. Some of the names of the
alumni who have done a great deal in
the recovery have appeared in the
headlines of the newspapers of the
country,

William F. Stevenson, '85, was ap-
pointed chairman of the Federal Home»
Loan Board by President Roosevelt.>~.
Mr. Stevenson is a former Congress-
man from South Carolina. He has
been so successful in his :work that he
has been appointed to the “recovery
board” of the President.

Roosevelt appointed a number of
business men to committees to.aid in
the re-employment drive. Prominent
among these was Charles Cannon, ‘15,
manufacturer of Concord, N. C.

Mayor George Coan, ’'11, Winston-
Salem, was appointed re-employment

employment Committee.

spent several years as students in Ger-
many, and have made several visits
there since.

The character of the French people,
bright, cheerful, and agreeable in man-
ner, was evident to the Lingles as they
stopped off in Paris for the few days
before they sailed for the United
States.

Dr, Lingle states that he enjoyed
his trip no end. “I hope to visit the
Balkans some summer in the future,”
he noted. “That will be my next trip.”
