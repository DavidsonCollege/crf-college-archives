Ah,

days

Pull up a chair. Relax. Allow
me, a wise and learned senior, to
spin you a yarn about one of
Davidson’s time honored tradi-
tions: her sports.

Nowremember, as an old man,
my memory may be foggy and I
may not get all the details right.
This is the story as best I remember
it.

There was a time, recently,
when a Davidson sports team hit it
really big. We were mentioned in
Sports Illustrated. Dick Vitale him-
self lauded our accomplishments.
Wecompeted against the very best
in the country, and more often than
not, we won. We had aright to be
cocky.

It was 1992, and Davidson
soccer was the story in college
sports.

Our fame was originally just
because we were hosting the col-
lege soccer final four: a beautiful
campus, some nice facilities and a
brilliant sales job by then-athletic
director Terry Holland and coach
Charlie Slagle got us that. But then,
out of the blue, the plot thickened.
The Davidson soccer team itself, a
forgotten entity amidst all the final
four talk, began to win games.

We had no scholarship play-
ers, all ‘“‘walk-ons,” even if they
did come here to play soccer. De-
spite our reputation as a “soccer
school” we’d never actually been
in the NCAA tournament before.
Maybe it was the pride of hosting
the final four that got our team
going. How could we possibly host
the party and not even show up?

We started to pile up victo-
ries. Senior leader Rob Ukrop was
scoring goals and we were win-
ning, but the student body wasn’t
yet interested. It would take more,
and the team provided. We returned
from Fall Break that year with notes
on our doors announcing that over
the weekend Davidson had beaten
UCLA, the No. 2 team in the coun-
try, on its home field, and we our-
selves were now in the top 20.
WOW! What had we been miss-
ing? The stadium started to fill, the
wins kept coming and before long,
we were one of 32 teams in the
NCAA tournament. Four of those
teams would win the prize of a trip
to Davidson for the final four.

Once in the tournament, we
were the total underdogs. Nobody
expected us to advance to the sec-
ond round, much less get to enjoy
the ultimate home field advantage
in the final four. (Any other seniors
getting chills yet, just remember-
ing this stuff?)

Our first opponent in the tour-

Saturday, the men’s soccer
team opened up their much antici-
pated season against Stanford in
the Wake Forest Classic in Win-
‘ston-Salem.

Men's Soccer

The whole team was looking
forward to strutting their stuff after
several weeks of tough practice
and hard work, but the results
weren’t what was hoped for as the

- Cardinals beat the Wildcats 1-0.

Davidson came out fired up
and dominated the first ten min-
utes of the game.

Unfortunately, the offensive
rush put forth by the team was
fruitless as Stanford turned away
the pressure.

The momentum changed
shortly as Stanford kept the ball in
the Davidson end for the rest of the
half.

Despite the rush, though,
Davidson turned away Stanford.
Alex Deegan and the defensive
trio of Isaac Stewart, Steve Tho-
mas and Chad Lagérwey success-
fully fended off the Stanford at-

Women’s varsity soccer practices against ex-JV male soccer players.

tack and by halftime the score was
knotted at 0-0.

At halftime, the team realized
that they were not playing up to
their potential and came out of the
break looking like adifferentteam.

“We really couldn’t get the
offense going in the first half,” said
Ryan Northington.

"We were lucky to get out of
the first half tied, and we knew we

were going to have to pick up our
level of play.”

Davidson dominated most of

the second half and had several
shots, but it was Stanford that broke
the tie in the 60th minute.

Aftera give-and-go, a Stanford

forward ended up with a one-on-

one against Deegan and finished
nicely for the game-winning goal.
From there on, the Wildcats

Rob Kosicki

really turned up the heat looking
for the tying goal.

“We turned it on looking for
the equalizer, but unfortunately we
came up empty,” Deegan said.

Up front, Phil Julien and Rob-
ert Clarke were forcing the ball
deep into the Stanford end and

‘kept the pressure on the Stanford

backs. Ian O’Brien had a great
chance but also was denied.
With four minutes left Keith

' Kleeman had Davidson’s best

chance when he blasted a shot on
goal.’

Again the Stanford goalie
made the stop, and the Wildcats’
hopes were dashed.

“We played better in the sec-
ond half yet it still wasn’t the level
that we have to play.at if we are
going to have the season we want
to have,” Northington said.

‘Davidson played College of
Charleston Monday in their sec-
ond game of the tournament.

Charleston is a tough team
which made the round of the final
eight in the 1994 NCAA tourna-
ment and will be a formidable op-
ponent.

But with a win, Davidson will
be able to get back on track and on
the way to their goal of a berth in
the NCAA tournament.

Women’s soccer loses to Asheville, 2-1

By Krissy Ford

On the road Sunday, the
Davidson women’s soccer team
suffered a 2-1 loss in their season
opener against UNC-Asheville.

Women's Soccer

UNC-A, having already got-
ten the first game jitters out the day

’ before in a winning performance,

took the lead with eight minutes to
go in the half.

Returning to the field after
halftime, the Wildcats dominated
the rest of the game.

Junior midfielder Melissa
Moser scored onacorner kick from
senior forward Claudia Lombard
just four and a half minutes into the
half.

But UNC-A countered with a

breakaway goal. In the last 38
minutes, the Wildcats continued to
play well but couldn’t convert on
the opportunities they had.

Also, the defense did an ex-
cellentjob of keeping UNC-A away
from the goal in the second half.

“We dominated the game,”
explains coach Kevin Hundley.
“The final score just happened to
be 2-1 them.”

UNC-A’s speed seemed to -

cause problems for the Wildcats.
The team was only outshot 15 - 12.

“They just had the edge in
quality shots. We got plenty of
shots off, we just needed to finish
them. We had two shots hit the
posts and two hit the crossbar,”
said Coach Hundley.

With such a young roster, the
team now has one game under its
belt and is looking to come out
even stronger Wednesday against
UNCC.

The Wildcats first home game
is Saturday at 4:00 p.m. against
Wofford.
