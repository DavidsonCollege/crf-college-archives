THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1994

Richard to give reading at Davidson this week

Writer continued from page 11

Bottom of the World, and in the
spring of this year, his first novel,
Fishboy was selected to be the
subject of a two-part essay by The
New York Times Book Review. His
short story “Strays” was included
in The Best American Short Sto-
ries in 1988, and a new story was
featured in Esquire’s Summer Fic-
tion Special this summer. He has
received the Jean Goodhart

Shapriot Fiction Prize, a Pushcart
Prize, and a New York Foundation
for the Arts Fellowship. _
Richard is a Southerner (his
degree is from Washington and
Lee), and his fiction is typically
placed in the South and peopled
with Southern characters. And he
is a very “contemporary” writer, a
student of Gordon Lish with a pen-
chant for experimentation. But he
is a typical example of neither the
southern writer nor the contempo-

rary experimental writer. His sto-
ries, collected in The Ice at the
Bottom of the World, engage none
of the stereotypical effects of

Southern fiction (unless it is to~

blow them wildly out of propor-
tion, reinvigorating them by mak-
ing them outrageous) and reach
more deeply into emotional terri-
tory than most experimental or
contemporary fiction ever begins
to do. His first novel, Fishboy,
begins strange and gets stranger

as it tracks the experience of a boy
(half-fish) on a boat with a crew of
freaks, murderers, and miscreants.
Though it may be gothic and South-
ern, this is not the stuff of Faulkner
or Styron rehashed, nor is it the
kitchen-and-bedroom. sort of fic-
tion so popular among too many
writers of Richard’s generation. His
writing is truly of a new sort, and it
is fascinating. Richard will be read-
ing Wednesday at 7:30 in the 900
room.

Page is even more brilliant than
‘before, and John Paul Jones shows
a stronger compositional input.
This is definitely Zeppelin’s peak
performance.

Appetite for Destruction: This
Guns-n-Roses instant classic is
robably in 90% of all Davidson

male CD collections (and 1% of
female collections). It’s the album
that rescued me from the horrors af
Top 40. This is most assuredly the
number one kick-butt album ever
released. The incredible level of
energy, style, and virtuosity car-
ries for twelve full songs, an ex-
treme rarity.

in the same ranks

bums deserve to be placed on this

list, but I have to limit myself. ~

There are four main factors that
make these albums great:

1) Great songwriting. These guys
can write a tune containing more
than three chords and a verse-
chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-

2) Great musicianship. With the
possible exception of the Beatles,
all of these bands are or were
among the best at their respective
instruments. The Beatles didn’t
need to be virtuosic, because they
were so revolutionary.

3) Depth: These albums simply do
not have songs on them that make
you press the skip button. They’re
all great. I only listen to Dark Side,
for example, if [have time to heari it
all the way through.

4) Influence: Each of these works
is a landmark. Sgt. Pepper’s was
one of the many Beatles’ albums
that redefined rock and roll. Dark
Side’ s influences are immeasurable,
ranging from whispered back-
ground voices to an obsessive dedi-
cation to production. Zeppelin, as
mentioned, spawned an entire fam-
ily of musical styles. Synchronicity
was instrumental in the break from
the heavy guitar crunching sounds
of the seventies.

Finally, Appetite’s influences
cannot yet be measured, but it defi-
nitely helped rescue us from techno
and pointed towards the grunge
movement of the early nineties.

Cause

Show continued from page 10

a mockery—exactly what they
wanted, The crowd ofice again
erupted into laughter and applause
as loud as any other time in the
evening.

Dr. Shelley Rigger and Beth
DeSonbre sang two folk songs,
one of which was in honor of the
victims of AIDS and the Quilt.

Next, Dr. Tony Abbott recited
the first poem from his recently
published collection of poems, “A
Small Thing Like A Breath.”

’ Drs. Garrett Fagan and John
Wertheimer performed a folksong
created by Irish immigrants in
Texas. j

The final performance was
given by Dr. Ed Palmer who per-
formed three blues songs in adeep,
resonant voice.

The evening concluded with
Assistant Chaplain Brenda Tapia
thanking all of the volunteers for
their help in coordinating the show.
She dedicated the show to Gary
Mason, Assistant Dean of Admis-
sions from 1987-89. Mason died
from AIDS in September of 1989.
Tapia noted that during his time
nearly everyone on campus had
been touched by Mason in some
way or another and marked with
sadness his tragic passing,

It was Mason who organized
the first faculty/staff talent show.

One hundred percent of the
revenue from the sale of the six
dollar tickets went to the AIDS
Memorial Quilt. Meg Kimmel said,
“We are having fun in the name of
a cause we believe in.”

Registration begins today
for SPADES FOR AIDS,
Monday, October 17

Dear Terry,

I have a small problem.
There’s someone I like, but the
only problem is that he is my
boyfriend’s good friend. I think he
likes me too, and things haven’t
been well with my boyfriend lately.
What can I do? I don’t want to
control myself.

Signed,

Dazed & Confused

|Dear Dazed & Confused,

I think I see your first prob-
lem—you don’t want to control
yourself. Let me ask you a ques-
tion: What happens when people
don’t control their hunger? They
getfat. Whathappens when people
don’t control their anger? They
kill people. What happens when
people don’t control their sex
drives? They get reputations.

Being mature members of this
society, we all know the impor-
tance of image. Without it we are
no one—just another face in the
crowd, just another silhouette in

the mist, just another bump on
the proverbial log. With an im-
age we are Mr. or Ms. Every-
thing, the eighth wonder of the
world, the latest guest on
Letterman, the guy who makes
such a stir at high school re-
unions.

But it can work the other
way, as well. A bad image can
turn you into Joe the pathetic
crack addict, or Mary the histri-
onic child abandoner; or in your
case Dazed & Confused the two-
timing nymphomaniacal whore
of Mecklenburg.

So watch out. Feel out the
situation carefully and decide be-
tween bachelor #1 and #2 on the
basis of what is right for you, but
more importantly on the basis of
what would make you look best
among your peers. And remem-
ber—happiness is important, but
image is everything.

Love,
Terry
