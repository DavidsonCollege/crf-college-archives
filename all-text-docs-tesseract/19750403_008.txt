Pitching propels Wildcats to 2 wins

By Bill Lloyd
Staff Writer

After a slow start the Wildcat
Baseball team boosted its
record to 9-6 with a 5-2 win over
Furman University on Monday.

The Cats are now 4-1 in the

Southern Conference with only
one loss to The Citadel.
__ “It was a tough game yester-
day but our big bats came
through when we needed them
and Joel Tew pitched an out-
standing game,’’ commented
Wildcat baseball coach Junior
Wade.

Last Wednesday The Citadel
came to Davidson and got off to
a quick lead in the early going.
A late inning Davidson
comeback did not prove to be
enough as the Cats dropped
their first conference game 6-4.

The Citadel played well but
Davidson’s personnel looked
more experienced in the losing
effort.

Thursday’s game was a
double-header against Califor-
nia State from Pennsylvania.
Sophomore Tim Barr pitched
the first game which the Cats
won 3-0.

Bill Todd slides into home on a wild pitch in the second inning of the Hamilton game

last Tuesday.

Sophomore Jim Nichols hit a
double to bring in two of the
runs and freshman third
baseman Dale Horner singled
in the third run of the game.

In the second game of the
double-header sophomore Tim
Peck pitched an impressive
nine strikeouts to win the game

3-2.

‘We looked tough both defen-
sively and offensively in this
win,’’ added Wade

Dale Horner hit an inside the
park homerun to start the
scoring for the Cats. With the
score tied 2-2 in the bottom of
the seveth inning, the Wildcats

loaded the bases on Stone’s -

double and walks to Gary
Pomaroy and George Weicker.

Senior catcher Mark
Rodgeman then picked up his
third hit of the game by drilling
a shot over the left fielder’s
head to knock in the winning

First baseman Weicker and

: were impressive at the plate in

% the double win.

Friday brought a game

against Williams College which
resulted in a 14-2 crush by the
Wildcats. Everyone hit well
especially Weicker and Nichols
who were 3 for 5 at the plate.

Junior Mike Hall pitched the
game and Davidson’s pitcning
depth is looking better as the
season continues.

Monday’s action had the Cats
traveling to Furman University
to win another important con-
ference game 5-2. Junior Joel
Tew pitched well and increased
his record to 3-1 in the con-
ference and 3-2 overall.

According to Wade, ‘‘Tew’s
pitching was just fantastic. At
one point Furman had the
bases loaded up but Joel
managed to pitch himself out of
the tight situation. That pretty
well ended it for Furman right

there.’’

Furman’s pitching resulted
in several walks for the Wild-
cats. Ever-consistent slugger
Weicker hit a home run and
was 3 for 4 at the’ plate.
Weicker has hit 4 home runs in 5
conference games.

Junior outfielder Ed
Willingham contributed a two
run double off the left field wall
to contribute to the win over
the Paladins.

This week the Wildcats face
Hamilton College, New York
State University and Wake
Forest here.
