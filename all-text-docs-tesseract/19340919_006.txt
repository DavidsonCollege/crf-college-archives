ROTC OFFICERS
WIN AWARDS IN
SUMMER CAMP

Local Military Unit Sets Camp
Record In Wall Scaling
Competition

P. C. AWARDED TROPHY

The annual R. O. T. C. encampment,
concluded July 18 at Fort McLellan,
near Anniston, Alabama, saw the local
military representation win numerous
awards and second place in the efficiency
cup rating. Forty Davidson Cadet Offi-
cers and Capt. F. M. Cochrane, who
served as head ‘of the military police,
were those of the local unit who spent
six weeks at the camp.

The local unit walked away with the
baseball championship on Field Day,
broke the camp record for the wall scal-
ing competition, and followed these vic-
tories with second places in the machine
gun tests and tug of war battles. The
record-breaking time made by the local
unit for getting eight men over an eleven
foot wall was 32 seconds,

Presbyterianism ranked highly. in the
race for the efficiency cup as Davidson,
leading until the last two weeks, was
overtaken by the unit from Presbyterian
Junior College. Although there were no
competitive matches for riflemen, David-
son men did well in that department, two
achieving the rank of expert riflemen.

Starting at five o'clock in the morn-
ing. the cadets went through training
on the automatic rifle, machine gun,
trench mortar, 37 millimeter gun and
the United States army rifle. They re-
ceived lectures on Anti-Air craft guns
and gas attacks,

Kach day there were
problems to be solved.

Practice in va-
rious methods of laying down fire, us-
ing actual bullets, was held and often
the cadets were afield taking instruction
in making and breaking camp and in out-
post duty. A plan of rotation of Offi-
cers was followed, thus giving each stu-
dent experience in various positions.

A, J. Potter, Battalion Commander for
the coming year, reports excellent morale
for the entire six weeks. Dances were
by various colleges every
week, Davidson and P. C. jointly spon-
soring the first.

Opportunity to attend the R. O, T. C.
training camp is given every year to
those rising Seniors who are officers in
their military unit. Colleges and thili-
tary schools from all over the South send
their Cadet R. O. T. C. officers for sum-
mer instruction. The camp this year was
directed by Commandant MacGruder, of
Fayetteville.

Dr. Lingle Makes Many
Tours During Vacation

Dr. W. L. Lingle, President of David-
son College, made several speaking tours
this summer in addition to his regular
duties at the college. He spoke for a
week at the Young People’s conference
at Camp Smyrna, Georgia, and for a
week in Jefferson, N. C.

Dr. Lingle also had Sunday engage-
ments from time to time which included
the Myers Park Presbyterian Church
in Charlotte, The First Presbyterian
Church of Hickory, The First Presbyter-
ian Church of Atlanta, The First Pres-
byterian Church of Charlotte, The First
Presbyterian Church of Asheville, and
The Third Presbyterian Church of Pitts-
burgh. i

On Friday, Sept. 21, Dr. Lingle will
make the opening address at Hollins Col-
lege in Roanoke, Va. He will address
the Junior Chamber of Commerce in
Winston-Salem the following Monday.

Freshmen Match Wits
With President Brown

According to a little incident as told
by “Skip” Brown, President of the
Davidson student body, the incoming
class of Freshmen have at least two keen
wits in their midst.

In the first few days of this session,
Brown, amongst his numerous duties, had
the pleasure of showing the new men the
high spots on the campus. At the par-
ticular instance under observation, he
had two of the members of '38 in tow,
and was proceeding up from the Y. M.
C. A. building toward Chambers, point-
ing out the interesting buildings as he
went.

Pointing toward the sleeping quarters,
Skip continued, “And here is the dormi-
tory row. Now to your right over
there you find new Chambers, where we
hold most of our classes.”

At this point, one of the Freshmen,
who had been silent for some minutes,
impulsively blurted out, “Aw, we know
all about that.”

Skip remarks that after this he sur-
rendered the point. Perhaps these
Freshmen aren’t so dumb as they're set
forward as being.

Treasure Island

This great work of Robert Louis
Stevenson with which we are all familiar
is produced very colorfully. Jackie
Cooper in the role of Jim Hawkins does
some splendid acting. The role of Billy
Bones is played by Lionel Barrymore.
Wallace Beery plays the role of Long
John Silver. The cast also includes
Lewis Stone, Otto Kruger, and Dorothy
Peterson. This show has received much
favorable criticism and should afford en-
tertainment for all.

This is a very enjoyable picture and
brings us again that diminutive and
sparkling star, Shirley Temple, who came
into fame during the past year, Gary

Cooper, Carol Lombard, and Shirley
Temple compose the cast.

Monday, Sept. 24—The Affairs of Cellini

This is a Twentieth Century produc-
tion, appearing in it are Frederic March
and Constance Bennett. It is the story
of the loves of the great lover Cellini
(Frederic March). According to re-
ports this should be an interesting pic-
ture.

Tuesday and Wednesday, Sept. 25, 26—
The Scartet—-Em press

The Scarlet Empress is a very color-
ful and spectacular picture. The scen-
ery and costumes are very scrumptuous.
It gives a very thorough and colorful
picturization of the Russian court, and
the conditions of that time. It takes
Marlene Dietrich from an innocent prin-
cess to the empress of Russia by win-
ning the affection of the army. Marlene
Dietrich is at her best in both looks and
acting.

Student Identification
Simplified By Pictures

Following the policy of several insti-
tutions of large student bodies, for the
first time, Davidson College is undertak-
ing to take pictures of every student.
These pictures will be attached to the
students’ ledger cards in order that they
may be more easily identified. This serv-
ice is done free of charge for the stu-
dents.

Students Welcomed By
Negroe’s Usual Appeal

This fall, as usual, it has been a com-
mon sight with the Davidson students to
see the younger among the colored pop-
ulation in the town haunting the grounds
and the campus in the hope of procuring
some type of work.

The fact becomes apparent from the
moment the student enters the college
for the first time to start the new ses-
sion, When a student stepped off the
bus—or train—there is no distinction, he
was immediately hailed by at least a
half dozen lusty young voices.

“Hey, mistuh, lemme ca’y yo’ trunk
up to the dormitories.” Although the
object of their pleas is very doubtful
of the ability of such a small coon to
“tote” such a large trunk, he invariably
either gives in in amusement, or, hard-
boiled, tells Hurdle to clear out.

For little Hurdle, known to every old
Davidson man, is sure to be among the
foremost in the crowd. His lower lip
sticks out in advance to warn you that
he too totes trunks with abanddn and
skill.

His two;sizes-too-large al-
most trip him in his eagerness. His
shoes form an added hazard. You find
it hard to refuse him, unless, as some
suggest, you are inured to the ways and
forms of begging among the little
negroes of Davidson's campus.

Dr. Lingle Addresses Body On
History And Future Of
Davidson College

EXPANSION STRESSED

The Synod of North Carolina held
their yearly meeting the sixth and sev-
enth of September at Davidson college.
The principal speech was rendered by
Dr. Walter §. Lingle who spoke on
Davidson College and Christian Educa-
tion,

Dr. Lingle traced the development of
the College from small beginning ninety-
seven years ago to its present develop-
ment. “Like all good things Davidson
began in a small way. I wonder if you
men realize how small it was? The Col-
lege in the very beginning was only a
small quadrangle. It was bounded on
the South by the two Literary Society
Halls, on the North by the old chapel,
which is now known as Shearer Hall,
on the west by Oak Row, on the East by
Elm Row. ‘That is just how big or how
small the original College was.”

Davidson's president at this point of
his speech tells of Mr. Maxwell Cham-
bers gift of a quarter of a million dol-
lars and explains how it was spent to
build old Chambers which was burned
in 1921, and of the various improvements
made on the campus.

With the growing college well out of
financial difficulties and with what was
thought a secure future Lingle con-
tinues. “But the Civil War ,soon came
and gave an almost fatal blow to the
Most of its endowment was
swept away. Its students and faculty
joined the army and for several years
there seemed little left.” .

college.

The speaker explains how the college
began to rebuild its faculty and student
body and -how with the turn of the
century an education revival was felt
in the South, Campaigns for raising
money were launched and nearly a mil-
lion dollars was received. Almost one
third being given by the General Educa-
tion Board.

The World War came, old Chambers
burned and the outlook was dark, but
through numerous campaigns enough
money was raised to build New Cham-
bers. Dr. Lingle goes on to say, “In
1926 in the midst of the campaign for
the new buildings their came another

engagements?

Having the games so nicely set up in
that way is mighty fine, but the real
nice part about the schedule is that all
but three of the games are to be played
on Richardson Field, right in the Wild-
cats’ own pasture. The Rose Bowl
could not furnish a more perfect set-
ting for Davidson to play in than the
beautiful little stadium that has been
erected by those liberal hearted alumni
of the institution, Lunsford and Smith
Richardson,

There is nothing in the world
that can give a team inspiration -
like the spirited yelling of David-
son’s “‘six-hundred”, and, too,
there is no place like home, even
to a bunch of tough, hard-fighting
football warriors.

Felix is planning to start making his
prognostications on football games in
the next issue of the paper, so be ready
to check his predictions and see how ac-
curately he’s scratching this season.

In the second section of his speech the
president tells the members of the Synod
what the college is attempting to do in
the way of Christian Education.

1, First of all our colleges are trying
to store the hearts and minds of our
students with a rich store of informa-
tion from a Christian point of view.

2. Our Christian Colleges are trying
to develop in their students an apprecia-
tion of the finest and best in the world
in which we live.

3. Our schools are trying to tedch our
men to think.

4. Our Christian Colleges are trying
to awaken in their students a holy am-
bition to be and do something.

5. Our Christian Colleges are attempt-
ing to develop Christian character.

The North Carolina Synod drew up
a resolution giving their sincere thanks
to Davidson College, to President. Lingle,
Dr. H. H. Moffatt, Mr. F. L. Jackson,
for his handling the details of the recep-
tion and to Dr. R. B. Lacy for the ex-
peditious way in which he presided over
the bession of the Synod.
