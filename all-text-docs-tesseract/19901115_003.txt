Our New Directory

If you haven't seen the new college directory that took :

_awholesemester toarrive under your door, you really are
missing a treat. On the cover is a personified answering
machine spewing cartoon bubbles with messages like:
“Welcome to the Lifestyles of the Poor and Unknown.
Josh, Tom and Mike are out ona caper with Joan Collins
and Roger Moore. Leave your name at the beep and we'll
get back to you. In the meantime—-champagne wishes and
caviar dreams.” Pencils, memos, and strewn papers adorn
the surroundings. Graphically, it is eye-stimulating, but

‘sérhs FiVvOl6US for the Davidson image.

In charge of the design was Mike Van Hecke, Deskidg

Design Manager of College Relations. “It looks more like —

a student directory: light-hearted, pleasant, visually dy-

namic. Something that won’t get lost under the clutter of ©

a desk.” On this point, one can not plausibly confute Mr.
Van Hecke, for the style is certainly energetic. Downright
aggressive. Butisit in the conservative, subdued, yet clas-
sic tradition of Davidson? When asked about campus re-
action to thedirectory, Van Hecke said two mons: “Gen-
eral delight.” Perhaps he is correct.

No Joy in Mudville These Days

To the Editor:

We are writing in re-
sponse to the letter written
by Seth McLaughlin and
Jeremy Kinner regarding the
Harvey Gantt-Jesse Helms
race, entitled “Gantt Article
Devoid of Truth.”

They trivialize an elec-
tion that sends a racist man
back to Washington. Jesse
Helms exclaimed in his vic-
tory speech last Tuesday,
“Well, there’s no joy in
Mudville tonight.”

Senator Helms knows
only one way of campaign-
ing and operating in Wash-
ington; he thrives by play-
ing on the fears of the elec-
torate.

In the recent election,
Helms masked: a racist
campaign under the themes
of Gantt supported tax in-
creases, gay and lesbian
rights, and racial quotas.
Gantt explicitly denied sup-
porting racial quotas, but

Helms decided to air televi-
sion ads to that effect.

The fact remains that the
largest civil rights bill ever
to go on the floor of the
United States Senate failed
by one vote, with Senator
Helms vehemently oppos-
ing the legislation. Harvey
‘Gantt stated his support for
this bill that would help
control job discrimination
and mentioned nothing of
quotas.

Are Mr. Kinner and Mr.
McLaughlin prepared toex-
plain the truth behind what
Senator Helms’ vote will do
to end racial bigotry to dis-
criminated employees?

Senator Helms has spo-

ken of the traditional North .

Carolina values he possesses
to combat the liberal Wash-
ington establishment.

Is it a North Carolina

value to disregard the 15th .

Amendment by demanding
that predominantly black

voting precincts close their
polling places promptly at
7:30 while others were left
undisturbed until everyone
had voted? Helms’ sup-
porters resorted to such
measures.

November 6 was a bleak
day in the history of North
Carolina.

The opportunity pre-
sented itself to send a pro-
gressive man to Washing-
ton who would have become
a strong advocate of civil
rights.

Maybe Mr. McLaugh-
lin and Mr. Kinner should
reflect on the missed oppor-
tunity to help put an end to
racial bigotry in North Caro-
lina’s. senatorial represen-
tation instead of Harvey
Gantt’s relevance to a
Monty Python movie.

Sincerely,

Maybe Mr. Hecke should ask himself if the new direc:

pes is of the college and for the college.
