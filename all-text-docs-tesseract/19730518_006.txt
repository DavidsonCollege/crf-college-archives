FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
One of many civilian war victims at Quang Ngai.

ea Davidson Future Safeguarded

With Adjacent Land Holdings

By BRUCE CORSER
Asst. Managing Editor

The campus of Davidson
College presently includes some
465 acres of contiguous land.
This compares favorably with
other campuses of similiar
schools.

President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr... commenting on_ this
acreage said, ‘“‘We are for-
tunate to have what we have.”
He added that the college owed
a debt to Grier Martin. past
president. for nearly doubling
the area from a previous total of
250 acres.

Spencer noted that the college
was “pretty well fixed’ and
that he ‘‘couldn’t foresee a time
when 465 acres would be
inadequate.’ He further poin-
ted out that acquiring land in
the vicinity was difficult both
because of the extreme expense
and unavailability of such land.

Quakers To Solicit Assistance

For Civilian War-Ravaged

By MICHAEL TANNER
Managing Editor

In early 1973, the American
Friends Service Committee
(AFSC) initiated a million-
dollar fund-raising drive in or-
der to finance further aid to the
civilian sufferers of the Viet-
nam war.

Next week, AFSC will can-
vass the dormitories of David-
son College. Sophomores
Dickson Phillips and Russel
Carter, the volunteer represen-
tatives of AFSC on campus, will
conduct the fund collecting on
Monday night after the showing
of ‘Once Upon A War’’, filmed
at the Quaker Rehabilitation
Center in Quang Ngai, South
Vietnam.

AFSC, founded in 1917, is a
Quaker service organization
which offers aid to areas of
strife, particularly those where
high civilian casualties are
present.

The organization, though
founded and administered by
Quakers, is presently non-
denominational and __in-
ternational with current pro-
jects in 18 countries abroad.

In Vietnam, AFSC operates a
prosthetics and rehabilitation
center at Quang Ngai, where
maimed civilian victims of the
war are fitted with artificial
limbs.

AFSC established the center
at Quang Ngai in July of 1967, to
meet the needs of ever-
increasing numbers of injured
civilians.

According to a study con-
ducted by Senator Edward Ken-
nedy’s Subcommittee’ on
Refugees, civilian casualties in
Vietnam from 1965 through 1971
number 1.1 million. This figure
includes 335,000 deaths and
80,000 surviving paraplegics
and amputees.

The film to be shown, ‘‘Once
Upon a War’’, is a documentary
which seeks to make known the
terrible human cost of the
American involvement in Viet-
nam.

The creation of British film-
maker and journalist Patricia
Penn, the film is a study of what

becomes of the many civilians
caught in the crossfire of the
never-ending conflict.

The 30-minute film will be
shown in Perkins at 3:30 p.m.
and in Love at 10 p.m. on Mon-
day.

Commenting on the activities
of AFSC, Carter and Phillips
emphasized that it is im-
perative that the American
people be constantly reminded
that the civilian need in, Viet-
nam still exists, despite the

recent signing of the cease-fire
and the myth of the war's end.

“The most important point to
be made about the project is
that is gives the donor an op-
portunity to make his own
peace over there. A donation is
a direct effort to help. It will
give someone a new limb,” he
Said.

‘‘We have a moral obligation
to help these people. This isn’t a
political drive of any sort, it
rises above all that mess,”
Phillips added.

likes to keep such land for
protection purposes. That is, to
be able to exclude industry or
other undesirable develop-
ments from blighting the cam-
pus area.

Spencer added that ‘“‘we
would be very reluctant to sell
any contiguous land that we do
have. No one knows what our
future plans might be.”

The college also owns two
other areas not a part of the im-
mediately adjacent campus
area. The section on Lake Nor-
man extends 96 acres and the
McConnell farm district com-
prises 107 acres.

Spencer remarked that the
McConnell farm tract might be
developed for faculty housing

purposes. This is presently
being studied by a land use ex-
pert.

Notably, two other sections
were used for similar projects
in past years. That space behind
the infirmary and also some
land on the road going south to
Concord are now the sites of
faculty housing facilities.

As for the improvement of
contiguous campus land, such
as around the cross-country
course, Spencer observed the
possibilities of a golf course or
more athletic fields.

However, something like a
golf course would be a large
capital expenditure and would
probably have to come in the
form of an alumni gift.

Another hope for the future
might be what Spencer termed
an ‘‘additional participation
gym.” This might be simply a
field house with three to five
basketball courts and added
handball and squash areas..

“ll these dreams are possible
yet Spencer emphasized that
they come _ behind other

priorities such as paying for the

library, and building a new

Union, chemistry, and fine arts
facilities.

Moreover, Vice President for
Finance and Development C.
David Cornell declared a
definite reluctance to become
involved in the real estate
business in managing either
present land holdings or new
acquisitions. He said that David-
son was simply not equipped to
become a ‘‘quasi-real estate
operator.”

Cornell related that in one in-
stance three years ago the
college sold land 10 miles out of
Charlotte donated by E. H. Lit-
tle, rather than speculate on its
value. Davidson does now own
land inside Charlotte. However,
this land was a bequest that
fobids the college to sell it. So
the land is now being leased for
annual profit.

Davidson also owns five acres
on I-77 on which it hopes to at-
tract a prospective high quality
motel.

Cornell said that the ad-
ministration had been in con-
tact with a number of people
though, as of yet, there has been
no affirmative response.

He stated that this was due to
the delay in the completion of
Interstate 77. “It’s this in-
definite quality that scares our
contacts,”’ he said.

Yet he declared that he was
still hopeful that someone would
see the wisdom of putting a
motel at that site.

Spencer summed up the
college land situation when he
observed that he was ‘‘glad that
we don't have any problems."’

He added that the expanded
enrollment will not have an ef-
fect on Davidson's real estate
holdings.

Students Explore Ageless Island

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Contributing Editor

(Ed. note: Romeyn is presen-
tly engaged in a_ biological
study at the Sapelo Island
Marine Institute for the en-
tire Spring Term. The following
is a description of an afternoon
spent on that remote unspoiled
island.)

While the concrete turkey
stood on his pedestal above the
fountain, the red _ roofed
buildings lay basking in the sun.
A decrepit jeep squatted
alongside the largest, and its
engine sputtered and died.

When momentarily two
young men appeared in the
doorway, a loud ‘‘damn it’’ was

. heard to echo within the court-

yard.

‘“‘Have you got the nets?” I
asked. —

“Yah.”

‘And the boxes and stuff?”

“Yup, and I checked us out."

“Ok, let's roll.”

The 1949 Willeys was missing
a fender and inclined rather
sharply to starboard. Although
it had been junked twice on the
mainland, it is one of the most
sought after vehicles on the
island, and so we complimented
ourselves on being able to grab
iton a weekday afternoon.

Reliable it was not. Two days
before its right front wheel had
fallen off along the dike road
Causing its two surprised oc-
cupants to veer madly into the
marsh. But she was fixed now.

There were gaping holes in the
floor, and no brakes.

When I rammed in the clutch,
the four cylinders roared, and
we fled northward along the
narrow dirt road dragging a
cloud of dust.

The north end of Sapelo
Island is a jungle. Moss hangs
in heavy drippings from the live
oaks and cedar, and marshes
and streams crisscross the
island at random.

Bristling acres of palmetto
trees make cross country
travel impossible.

Like the rivers and the deer
trails, what roads there are
wander aimlessly in a pattern
of right angle turns and blind
alleys.

Rolling northward over
Raccoon sluff, the altitude peak
of the island at 16 feet, wemean-
dered among the abandoned
churches and brush-choked
cabin sites where a fragment of
the island's black population
once lived.

There are about 200 blacks on
the island now. However, there
were more in past years, and the
island abounds with the colorful
names of their former set-
tlements: Chocolate, Hang Bull,
Long Tabby, Drink Water, Hog
Hammock, Bell Marsh.

Suddenly, as the trails
branched, our pathendedinasea
of liquid mud. With the ac-
celerator to the floor, we slid
through as I looked through the
floor at the foaming mud and
water below, a layer of cold

mud slithered down my leg to
form a coating on my shoes.

Finally the jeep swept out into
a clearing of dense palmetto
scrub with an impressive roar,
causing two turkeys to flap
reluctantly over the hedge.
Across the creek was the dense
forest of Blackbeard Island,
separated from Sapelo by a few
hundred yards of impassible
salt marsh.

Like Sapelo it too is a wildlife
preserve, famed for the size of
its alligators and diamond back
turtles, and as the one time
haunt of the pirate Edward
Teach for whom it was named.

A fortune in treasure is
reputed to lie buried
somewhere among the scrub
that rises behind the marsh in a
wall.

The sun was resting on the up-
turned branches of the live oaks
when we bounced around the
last turn and drew up beside the
duck pond. The duck pond is the
symbol of wilderness on Sapelo.

The small freshwater lake,
fringed with reeds, its glass
sheet broken by coasting
alligators and wading birds, is
at the island's northern most
end.

We spent several hours ex-
ploring the unspoiled reaches
and coves of the pond. With the
approach of dusk and hordes of
mosquitos we returned to. the
Jeep for the return trip.

I gazed out over the bay, and
waited for the usual roar and
blast of fumes. But none came.

There was silence as the engine
was dead. As we walked off into
the forest, the mud dried on the
hood where we had written
‘walking to Chocolate."’

Chocolate (a corruption of the
original name of La Chalet), is
the ruin of a once fine plantation
where a few ancient pecan trees
shade the tabby skeletons of the
island's by-gone era. Where
once Geechee (the Negro dialect
of English still widely spoken
on the island) rattled in the
breeze, only the rustle of leaves
prevails.

Two hours, and six miles
passed.: The sun had disap-
peared and we were deep within
the forest. Unconcerned deer
browsed in the open places as:
we hurried by the rustle of
leaves suggested that untold
millions of rattlers stalked us
from the underbrush.

We felt no better when two
large vultures appeared and
kept pace with us for several
miles, flying along from tree to
tree.

The forest absorbs noise well,
and the truck was almost upon
us before we saw it. It was our
8roup truck filled with guys who
laughed when we yelled and
waved. We clambered in amidst
a barrage of questions.

‘‘Where have you been?"

“Get stuck?"

I contemplated the mud and
nat bites on my legs. ‘‘Naw”, |
said, “we just spent some time
exploring!“
