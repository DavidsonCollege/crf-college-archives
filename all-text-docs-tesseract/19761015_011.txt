“Yomen-score 5-0}

Over Wake Forest

By MEGAN GALLAGHER
Staff Writer

Tuesday, the Davidson Wo-
men’s Field Hockey Team
finished its first full game of
the season with a 5-0 win
against Wake Forest.

Scoring twice within the
first five minutes of the game,
the girls established a strong
offensive strike that domina-
ted the game.

First to score was Lynn
Elliot when the ball was
involved in a tight scrimmage
at goal. Martha MacGill’s
score followed close behind in
the same-sort of play.

Later in the first half, Beth
Tanner scored from a corner
hit by Elliot.

Second half scoring was
dominated by Bunny Horine
who first intercepted a corner
pass from Belle Erdman and
later used a push pass to
knock a ball in that had
deflected off the opposing
foalie’s pads.

Coach. Susan Roberts said
she was ‘‘very pleased with the
cohesiveness of the forward
line. The front girls have been
consistant in their pressure
upon the goalie and watching
for deflected shots.’’

Roberts went on to say she
was ‘‘happy with the estab-
lishment of the new defensive
stratagy. Only fifteen minutes
of the hour game was spent in
our defensive territory. That
indicated that our defense had

got control of the new plan,
can clear the ball effectively,
and the speed to get back to
the goal and defent it.”’

“Goalie Cindy Curtis was
great in her ability to handle
one on one play. Several times
she was put in that position
and managed to get the ball
out to the side.”’

‘‘The overall play of the
team is greatly improved and I
will concentrate on condition-
ing and some fundamentals for
the remainder of the season
and theDeep South tourna-
ment in November,” conclu-
ded the new coach.

Monday the women will
take on Converse College in
Spartanburg, S.C.

Chance to work outside brings three
gym, athletic fields

to service Wildcat

By MARK SCANDLING .
Staff Writer

The upkeep of Johnston
Gym, Richardson Field, and
all the practice and intramural
playing fields is not an easy
task. It requires a great deal of
time and effort.

Three men are involved in
this year-round job. Buddy
Robbins, David Reid, and Don
Kistler are the men respon-
sible for maintaining the qual-
ity of Davidson’s athletic faci-
lities. Their duties range from
preparing the stadium for

Wildcat football games, to
lining the intramural fields for
flickerball.

Fresh air and the opportun-
ity to work outside attracted
each of these men to David-
son. Buddy Robbins left his
job at the Lance Cracker
Corporation in 1967, and came
to work at the gym. David

Reid has been working on the::-

campus for eleven years, the
past five in the gym.

The newest. member of this
close-knit group is Don Kistler
who left his job at the Moores-
ville Mills in 1975 in order to
begin working at Davidson.

They all enjoy their various

tasks and jobs. None are too .

distasteful or boring. When
asked if he had any favorite
job Robbins replied, ‘‘They are
all my favorite, or I wouldn’t
be here.”’

This shared love of the
outdoors, also, carries over
into their personal hobbies.
Both Kistler and Reid like to
hunt and fish, while Robbins
is a golfing enthusiast.

all are staunch sup-
porters of the Wildcat teams.
'Robbins, who was faised in
this area, recalled how he
“used to sit in the trees, and
watch the football games forty
years ago.’’ His enthusiasm
and interest has not waned.
He still enjoys watching all
the sports, and getting to
know. the members of the var-
ious teams.

Reid is a basketball fan. He
has followed the team’s for-
tunes and misfortunes over
the past. eleven years. Al-
though the quality of the team

has slipped since the days of
Mike Malay, who is his favor-
ite player, Reid says, ‘‘I’m
still looking at them and
hoping...”

Until he began to work in
the gym, Kistler was not a
follower of Davidson athletics.
However in the last year and a
half, he has become a solid
supporter and fan.

Unlike their gym compat-
riot Pops, each of these men
plan to work quite a while
longer. They are enjoying
themselves too much to quit
