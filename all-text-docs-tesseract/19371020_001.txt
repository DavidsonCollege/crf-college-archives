- +Davidson—has— seven—men
who will try out in their re-
spective states for the Rhodes

Scholarship appointments, ac-;

cording to Dr. G. R. Vowles,
head of the Rhodes Scholar-
ship, committee.

Wade Boggs, Heywood Hill,
Watson Street, Bill Kiesewetter,
Richard Vowles, Jim Reinhardt and
Pete McKnight, have all made their
intentions known to try out for the
famous scholarship. Dr.~ Vowles
stated that this was a small num-
ber of applicants in accordance to
the number_applying in former
years,

He also stated that the executive
committee has, in writing, these ap-
plications, and would pass on them
at their next meeting. After the
executive committee has passed on
them, the men must appear be-
fore their respective state commit-
tees on either December 16 or 18.
If any of these men pass a state
committee, they will then have to
appear before a district committee.
Two men are selected to act as
Rhodes Scholars from each district,
making a total of 32 Rhodes schol-
ars per year, *

Boggs will appear before the
committee in Louisiana, Street in
Alabama, Kiesewetter in Pennsyl-
vania, Hill in Virginia, and Vowles,
Reinhardt and McKnight in North
Carolina.

Davidson’s most recent Rhodes
scholar was Carleton B. Chapman,
who won the distinction in 1936.

Dr. E. Smith
Talks Sunday

Retired Foreign Missions Sec-
retary to Discuss Orient

The Rev. Dr.rEgbert W. Smith
will be the speaker at the chapel
services next Sunday evening. His
subject will be on Japan; in the
morning he will be heard at the
Davidson Presbyterian Church dis-
cussing mission work in China.

Mr, Smith is an authority on ‘the
Far East, having been the secre-
tary of Forcign Missions of the
Southern Presbyterian Church for
many years. He has written wide-
ly on mission work in the Orient,
and his book, “The Creed of Pres-
byterians,” has sold by the tens of
thousands,

He has been heard on the cam-

pus in previous years and his re-

turning is largely due to popular
request. Since Dr. Smith has re-
tired from an active pastorate, it
is a privilege to secure him.

Dr. Smith, who graduated from
Davidson in 1882, is a member of a
very distinguished family of five
brothers. One of them is Dr. Henry
Louis Smith, former president of
Davidson. It is an interesting fact
that al of. them are named in
“Who's Who.”

Dr. Smith resides_.in Nashville,

Tenn., where he continues to take)
in Church work

a great interest:
and world affairs. He has devoted
more of his time to writing on mis-
sions since retirement from active
service. Lunsford and H. Smith
Richardson, nephews of Dr. Smith,
made possible the Richardson stad-
ium and Davidson's fine athletic
field.

YMCA Office Hours

As many students have inquired
as to the hours when the ‘“Y” sec-
retary will be in his office for con-
ferences, the following office hours
of the “Y” secretary are published.

Evety morning from 9 until 12,
except during the third period and
in the afternoon from ,1 until 2.

Oh

Not many Davidson students are
aware of the fact, but Colin tine
Magician is living right here on
the Davidson campus! Although
you might not think so just to talk
to him, Colin is none other than
Shaw Smith, a member of the jun-
ior class who transferred from Oak
Ridge Military Istitute this year:

Shaw has been practicing the
black arts of magic for a gogd
many years, having given his first

professional performance when on-'

ly ‘15 years old. Ef his petition to
the faculty for the use of his car
is granted, he plans to earn a part
‘of his college expenses by putting
on shows in the neighboring towns.
Later on Shaw expects to give a
sample of his tricks to the Dawid-
son students here in town. .
It seems that he has, with a few
-exceptions;-“picked up” the ma-
gician’s trade. “I've liked it
since I was little,” he said. “There
was a professional magician in my
home town, Mt. Olive, N. Cy and I
learned a good deal from him by
helping him in performances around
there. Then, with Lem Kornegay
as my first assistant. I started put-
ting on backyard--shows when I
was about fourteen years old.”
Classroom Performance
Shaw's first “break” came when

failed to appear on
Program in scheel. From that time
on. he became known locally as a
magician, and appeared profession-
ally for the first time when fifteen.

“At first I wanted to quit school
and take magic as imy life work,
but my mother objected to
idea,” he laughed. Because of the
fact that he has been attending
school, Shaw has worked most of
the ‘time-in-the summer, although
he gave several performances in
towns near Oak Ridge last year.

According to Shaw, magic is a
very expensive business. "Rgsides
talent and liking for the work,” he
said,'“a great many costly mater-
jials are required. And then it takes
a lot of practice, too.”

Although people are always ask-
ing a magician to tell the secret’;

Another integral part of the
college’s Orientation progtam
for the class of ’41 will begin
Friday night with the first of
a series of receptions for the
freshmen.

The class was divided up into
groups of fifteen during Oriertta-
tion period, with cach group hav-
ing, a student and faculty member
as advisers. Watson Street, class
adviser, and Professor Gwynn have
decided to combine several groups
at each reception, thus saving a lot
of time and effort, besides giving
the various groups a chance to get
better acquainted with cach other.

Napoleon's General
There is a well authenticated
story about Ney that says he was
the same person as Peter Stuart
INey, country school teacher here
in North Carolina. The main basis
of this story is Peter Stuart Nev's
claim on his death-bed that he was

Napoleon's. famous general.
Added to this fact is Peter Stuart

ed teacher, set up a classical school

linas. He died in 1864 claiming
that he was Marshal Ney.

Tt is a definite fact that Peter
Stuart Ney was called on to de-
sign the college seal, and that he
did so. It was he who selected the
words “Alenda Lux Ubi Orta Lib-
rertas” and designed the seal. This
is the reason for Davidson's in-
tercst in the tives of these two men
whom, we believe, were one and
the same person.

James Jetton Killed

lames Jetton, 24-year-old son of
Mrs. E.-P. Jetton of near David-
son, was killed instantly last Fri-
day afternoon > about 1 o'clock
while repairing a telephone wire
leading into his home.

While attempting to tighten the
telephone wire, Mr. Jetton broke
it and the wire fell on a charged
electric wire. The shock knocked
Mr. Jetton from his Jadder and he
fell into the tangled telephone wire,
which was heavily charged.

He is survived by his mother and
a sister, Miss Bettie Virginia Jet-
ton of Charlotte, and two brothers,
Hughes, of Davidgon, and ‘Lewis of
Charlotte.
