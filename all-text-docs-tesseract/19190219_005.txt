DR. RICHARDS DECLARES
A VISION 1S NEEDED

The “Y” vesper service last Sunday
was conducted by E. G. Lilly, as Mr.
Miles was off on the trip with the bas-
ketball team. After a short talk on the
coming evangelistic campaign by Dr. C.
F. Myers, of Greensboro, Lilly intro-
duced Dr. Richards, who made the talk
of the evening.

Dr. Richards chose as his text Acts
26:19: “Wherefore, O King Agrippa,
I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
vision.” Lt was this heavenly vision that
enabled Paul to do the wonderful work
that he did; and it is only by having a
vision that we will be able to be a power
for Christ in the world. Alexander and
Caesar conquered the world around the
Mediterranean with the aid of — their
armies. Paul converted, directly or in-
directly, the world around the Mediter-
ainean, with no army at his back. He
laid a foundation of a permanent empire
much greater than either Alexander or
Caesar dreamed of. Paul accomplished
this because he was an__ indefatigable
worker, because he had a wonderful per-
sonality, and, above all, because he had a
vision. Paul received his vision on the
way to Damascus. It was strengthened
during his stay in Arabia. And it re-
ceived its final impetus when he return-
ed to Jerusalem and talked with those
-wH6 knew Christ personally. This vis-
ion that Paul received was the power
that moved his life.

The world still needs.the man with a
vision. A light. from heaven is not a
necessary clement of a vision. Paul's
vision was not of that, but of Christ,
the Lord of the redeemed man, and the
Saviour of the lost man. It is necessary
to have this vision continually before us.
to become the dynamic force’ moving
our lives if we are to do our duty in the
world.

NEW PLAN FOLLOWED
IN POLITY CLUB

The Polity Club had .a most interest-
ing meeting on the night of Friday, Feb-
ruary 14. The topics under discussion
were the part England and Turkey took
in the great war, and the new constitu-
tion of the League of Nations read at
the Peace Conference.

W. T. Dunlap gavesa comprehensive
outline of the many ways in which Eng-
land did more than her share of the
fighting. She furnished the all-important
navy that kept Germany bottled up. and
convoyed’ the soldiers of the United
States safely to France. She put a
splendid army in the field, and took
charge of the situation in the Holy Land
as well as holding the Hun in his tracks
in Flanders.

W. M. Currie gave his views of what
England hoped to get out of the war.
He stated that England had little hope
of getting much money or territory as a
payment of German's indemnity, but had
already attained the greatest object of
her conflict. her peace of mind and free-
dom from German attacks,

XN. Y. Pharr and Emery Flinn fol-
lowed these discourses with some state-
ments regarding the entrance of Turkey
into the fight. She did so because Ger-
many influenced her to believe that she
was winning the war, and Turkey want-
ed to get on the side which was expected
to be victorious. Remarks concerning the
Peace Conference were next on the pro-
gram and were found to be instructive
and entertaining. The next meeting
will be held on Friday, February 28.

Lieut. J. W. Stuart Gilchrist, '15,
was on the Hill Saturday. He has just
recently returned from overseas. His
brother “Pat” is in the class of ’22.

BRIG.-GEN. R. D. JOHNS

Brig.-Gen. Robert D. Johnston, aged
83. died at his country home, Whitepost,
near Winchester, Va.. on February 1.
As General Johnston was, for two vears,
President of the Board of ‘Trustees, and
widely known thruout this section of the
country, the foregoing will be received
by the Davidson alumni and — friends
with a feeling of deep regret.

The General entered the Confederate
army as a private, at the age of 28. He
advanced rapidly to head of his brigade,
and had the honor of being the youngest
general in the Confederate army,
courage which he is reputed to have dis-
played in the service of his country was
manifest thruout his long life.

ston was actively connected with David-
