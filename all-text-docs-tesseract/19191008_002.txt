The scores Saturday indicate that it
is either too hot for college football or
else the big teams have not been put in
good shap. Out of the forty or more
games played in the South and East,
‘only two went above fifty points. West
Virginia beat Westminster 55-0 and!
‘Pennsylvania beat P, M. C. 54-0. Both
of these teams are just opening their sea-
son and naturally had very light oppo-
nents.

North Carolina State suffered a terri-
ble defeat at the hands of the Navy.
Although they took with them what was
considered to be a formidable line-up,
the Navy piled up seven touchdowns.
The North Carolinians were not able
to put across a single first down during
the entire game. ‘This should not be
considered too much as an indication of
hweakness on the part of the losers, as
the Navy this ycar has one of the strong-

est teams in the country.

The University of Virginia again dis-
appointed its supporters by failing to
score on the Richmond College Spiders.
“At the first of the season the Spiders
had only one letter man around which
to build a team. Virginia had two good
chances to score but failed to make the
necessary gains. Just before the game
ended the Spiders made two first downs
‘and were gaining consistently when the
whistle blew, the game ending with the
ball in their possession on Virginia's
twenty-yard line.

One interesting factor in Saturday's
games was the comparatively poor show-
ing made by the teams we face this sea-
son. With the exception of Washing-
ton and Lee, who beat Randolph-Ma-
con 21-0, none of them put up their best
brand of ball. South Carolina beat Ers-
kine only 6-0, Georgia Tech beat Wake
Forest less than we did and N. C. State
was walloped by the Navy.

* ¢

Georgio Tech staged a rather un-
usual feature by pulling off a double-
header Saturday. In the first game
they beat the Camp Gordon team 48-0.
The soldiers’ line averaged two -hun-
‘dred pounds and they depended on line
tucks for their gains. Injuries, how-
ever, prevented them from making any
headway. Their second game was some-'
what of a disappointment, Wake Forest
holding them to two touchdowns. Judy
Horton, the big fullback, made both of
these scores.

The University of Georgia opened
their season with Citadel Saturday, de-
‘teating them 28-0. The lighter Citadel
eleven was able to hold until the fourth
quarter when they became worn out and
allowed the Red and Black four touch-
downs... This is the first game Georgia
has played since before the war.

j. Auburn has a new linesman very fit-
tingly named Sizemore, who, it is said, |
weighs 285 pounds. It is also claimed
that this young giant has this corpulence
well distributed over his anatomy and
is not at all slow. If all this is true,!
we should hear more from Mr. Size-
more before this. season is over.
ee

Outside of the game in Lexington,
about the biggest thing in football this
week is the West Virginia-Pittsburgh

game. Coach Warner has been prepar-
ing for this game since early in Septem-

ber and has some new plays which he

expects to uncork at that time. With
their twenty-seven letter men back West
Virginia hopes to defeat the champions
or at least hold them to a close score.

INTER-DORMITORY BASKET-
BALL SCHEDULE AN-
NOUNCED.

Mr. Miles has formed a series of bas-
ketball_ games between the dormitories,
to stimulate dormitory spirit and to give

mitories as soon as possible, as there is
little time for practice:

ARE WE GOING TO SEE THE
A. & E. GAME?—I'’LL SAY
“WE ARE...

The game with A, & E. is to be
played in Charlotte on November 8.
Every man on the hill mav as well be-
gin to save his pennie$, for everyone
must be at the game. By that time the
band will probably be in shape to turn
out in good style and the other students
must help back the team. Plans are un-
der way to get the whole student body
down on the eleven-fifty and back again
that night on a special train.

Manager Hall says that he is plan-
ning a big parade through the principal
streets of Charlotte to get up interest
just before the game. In the afternoon
everything will move toward the field
where the last act is to take place.

Look out, A. and E.

MOTHER.

Jest a sittin’ by th’ fireplace,
In th’s warm light’s cheery glow,
En a watchin’ dreams en visions
In th’ firelight, come en go.

Oh, th’ joy th’ dreams kin bring ye!
Oh th’ hopes we dare not name!

As we sit thru magic hours

Seeing pictures etched in flame.

When I’m feelin’ sorter weary,
Sorter pine fer sympathy,

Then I see my truest friend

A. lookin’ frum th’ flames at me.

Eyes so tender like en lovin’,
With a message pure en clear,
Send my worries all a humpin’
En plumb fill me up with cheer.

Face thet's kinder lined with wrinkles
Caused by worries not her own;
*Cause th’ cares thet tumble on me

Air never born by me alone.

Hair thet’s jest a lettle silver
Shows th’ sterling o’ th’ heart
Thet hez been my guidin’ Angel
Since my life fust made its start.

Lips that sorter smile approvin’
When I'm sailin’ right along;
En thet droop in grief en sorrer
When I go a leetle wrong.

It’s th’ face o’ one I'm lovin’

Like I’m lovin’ nary other;

Cause I'm lookin’, en I’m dreamin’,

En I'm longin’ fer—my+Mother.
