"TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY

If you have been reading this column—and I hope you have; I
mean I genuinely hope so; I mean it does not profit me. one
penny whether you read this column or not; I-mean I am paid
every week by the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes and my
emolument‘is not affected in any way by the number of people
who read or fail to read this column—an act of generosity
perfectly characteristic of the makers of Marlboro, you would
say if you knew them as I-do; I mean here are tobacconists gray
at the temples and full of honors who approach their art aa
eagerly, as dewy-eyed as the youngest of practitioners; I mean
the purpose of the Marlboro makers is simply to put the best of
all possible filters behind the best of all possible tobaccos and
then go, heads high, into the market place with their wares,
confident that the inborn sense of right and wrong, of good and
bad, of worthy and unworthy, which is the natural instinct of
every American, will result in a modest return to themselves
for their long hours and dedicated labors—not, let me hasten to
add, that money is of first importance to the makers of Marlboro;
all these simple men require is plain, wholesome food, plenty of
Marlboros, and the knowledge that they have scattered a bit of
sunshine into the lives of smokers everywhere; if, I say, you
have been reading this column, you may remember tbat last
week we started to discuss Christmas gifts.

Jo Wu Kitow Someone who 15 teheresled wedmericas Kislory ?

We agreed, of course, to give cartons of Marlboro to all our
friends and also to as many total strangers as possible. Today
let us look into some other welcome gifts.

Do you know someone who is intercated in American history?
If so, he will surely appreciate a statuette of Millard Fillmore
with a clock in the stomach. (Mr. Fillmore, incidentally, was
the only Anjerican president with a clock in the stomach.
James K. Polk had a stem-winder in his head, and William
Henry Harrison chimed the quarter-hour, but only Mr. Fillmore,
of all our chief executives, had a clock in the stomach. Franklin
Pierce had a sweep second hand and Zachary Taylor had
seventeen jewels, but, I repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Fillmore
alone had a clock in the stomach. Some say that Mr. Filimore
was also the first president with power steering, but most
historians assign this distinction to Chester A. Arthur. How-
ever, it has been established beyond doubt that Mr. Fillmore
wes the first president with a thermostat. Small wonder they
called him Old Hickory !)

But I digress. To get back to welcome and unusual Christmas
gifts, here’s one that’s sure to please—a gift certificate from the’
American Chiropractic Society. Accompanying each certificate
is this winsome little poem:

Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,
Joyous sacro-tliac!

May your spine forever shine,
Blessings on your aching back.

May your Lumbar ne'er grow number,
May your backbone ne’er dislodge,
May your caudal never davdle,

Joyeux Nocl! Heureux massage!

The makers of Marlboro, who take pleasure in bringing you
this column throughout the school year, would like to Join,
with Old Max in extending greetings of the season.

sailboats, dinghys and canoes.
Nearby is an excellent picnic
area with seven charcoal grills,
a boat loading ramp, and a
large parking area.

The desolation of the area
two years ago and the changes
ft has undergone are incom-
parable. In addition. refine-
ments of existing facilities are
being rapidly carried out.
Lighting standards are being
prepared in the College work-
shop for immediate installation.
The lights will be spread over
the grounds with underground

An aluminum and = redwood
railing designed by Grover
Meetze, director of the physical
plant, is also being constructed
for the pier. Meetze says that.
there will ultimately be slips
for twenty boats around the pier
with additional room for light-
er craft.

of development, has stated the
ultimate goal of the project: ‘‘to

Mysterious Ways Of Wonderland

Leave Innocent Young Alice Agape

(Editor’s note: The follow-
ing article by that quasi-leg-
endary campus character Er-
vin Duggan first appeared in
the Midwinters. 1960 issue of
THE DAVIDSONIAN. Inces-
sant requests have led to its
republication.)

1. DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE.

Alice went down, and
down, and down.

‘How curious!” she
thought. “I cannot remem-
ber when first I started to
go down like this!”

Suddenly it. ended. Thump!
Thump! Down she came upon
a heap of sticks and dry leaves,
and her fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt; in
a moment she jumped up and
looked around.

The White Rabbit had fled,
She was standing in a muddy
wood. apparently on a high hill.
She looked up. but. it was dark
overhead; in the distance she
could faintly discern a cluster
of domed and columned build-
ings.

“How exciting!” exclaimed
Alice. “I may be in ancient
Greece! Or Rome! ! wonder

.. oh! .. .” Just at that
very moment, a great Pig,
clad in billowing tulle skirts
and a tiara, secampered up the
hitl and galloped to a halt
before Alice.

“Is this Rome?’’ cried Alice
to the Pig.

“Naw, dearie,"’ moaned the
Pig. ‘but it's hell on Christians
all the same."’ The Pig began
to ruffle her skirts. “Darn.
Lookit that. My tail is a mess."

“Why are you running away?
Is this place perilous?” asked
Alice.

The pig snorted. “Well, It’s |

Itke this, honey. They say It’s
a safe place for sons, and 1
say the hell with it. It’s rough
on daughters.”

“Oh!" cried Alice, frightened.
“But who are you?”

The Pig adjusted her tiara.

‘I,’ she said with great dig-
nity, “I am the Queen of
Queens.”’

Alice dropped a deep curtsy.
which fhe Pig acknowledged
with a nod. “Your majesty,”
queried Alice, ‘‘what has been
happening down there?°’

“You'll hafta see it to be-
lieve it,” said the Queen,
lumbering off across the hill.
“G'wan down there. But
watch out for the blond guy
tn the waistcoat; he's pretty
raunchy.”

b Alice started. The White Rab
it!

She began to run down the
hill. “How curious!" she
thought.

tl. THE MAD TEA-PARTY

The columned buildings were
deserted. Alice could hear mu-
sie and voices in the distance,
but she knew not where they
were,

She stopped before the larg-
est building. Inscribed above
the columns were some curious
words. ‘How curious!” ex-
claimed Alice.

Suddenly she heard a voice:
‘Hiya, baby. You unattached?”

AALVIVESIII IID, Utd 2 cere
°

The White Rabbit, clad in a
Madres waistcoat, stood behind
her.

‘‘Where—where did you come
from?" Alice cried.

“Beautiful but naive,"’ mut-
tered the Rabbit—and then to,
Alice: “You wanna go to the
party with me? My date-—damn
pig—ran off somewhere.”

Alice could say nothing.
Before she knew what she was
about, the Rabbit had taken
her arm. They were walking
foward an immense object
which tooked fSike a white
beetie with shining eyes.

“Corvette,’’ said the White
Rabbit, and Alice nodded, mute-
ly. How frightened she was!
They climbed into the thing.
The Rabbit was. singing.

“Oh, it’s RABBITS — RAB-
BITS - RABBITS, that teach
you—"’ His voice was drown-
ed by a muffled roar, and the

curious machine began to
move forward.
“How extraordinary!’’ Alice

thought. ;

Presently they stopped. They
had come to a.low hall, hung
outside with lights. From _ in-
side came shouts. and the
thumping of great drums. The
Rabbit led her inside. The hall
was dark, and deserted but for
a cluster of Nubians or Ethio-
pians about the drums.

“Are they Hottentots?”’
quired Alice.

“Right,’’ said the Rabbit, and
began to sing again: "*.. . Get
‘em atta peanut stand, yeah,
yeah, yeah... "Alice was sil-
ent.

Presently they walked to
a table upon which rested a
tall bottle. Tiled round the
neck of the bottle was a pa-
per label with the words

“DRINK ME” printed in large

tetters.

“How curious!" said Alice.

“Aw, g'wan,”’ said The Rab-
bit. ‘Live a little.’

“No, I'll look first.’’ she said,
“and see if it's marked poison
or not."

“Christ,” moaned the Rabbit.
“‘How foggy can a girl get?"

However, this bottle was NOT
marked ‘poison’, so Alice ven-
tured to taste it, and finding it
very nice, she very soon finish-
ed it off.

“What a curious feeling!”
said Alice; “I must be shutting
up like a telescope!*’

“God forbid,” said the Rabbit,
and he took a drink from the
bottle.

Alice felt very queer indeed.

Finally her eyes focused
again and she looked about
the hall. Many people were
arriving. She looked at the

Rabbit. He was chuckling

now, and there was a curious
gleam in his pink eye.

“How curious!"
thought. . .

i, ALICE’S EVIDENCE

The next morning Alice
awoke to find herself upon the
wooded hill again. She was
alone, and she felt terribly
queer.

“Oh!’’ she cried. ‘I feel as if
there's not enough left of me
to make ONE respectable per-

in-

Alice

son!’’ She sat up and looked
about curiously.

Soon her eyes fell on a little
box that was lying nearby.
She picked it up and read
upon It the words, “EAT
ME”, and beneath, in small-
er letters, “A combination of
ingredients. Will not upset
your stomach.””

“Well, [cll eat it,’” said Alice.
“I scarcely care what happens,
I feel so queer.”

She opened the box. popped
the little pill inside into her
mouth.

Something curious ‘began to
happen.

“Curiouser and curiouser!”’
she cried, “Now | am opening

feet!" For suddenly, when
she looked she could not see
her feet at all. And still she
grew — more and more and
mote.

Alice sat down.

“How horrid!’ she thought.
“Whatever could have happen-
ed?"

In the silence of the wood, no
answer came... only the chirp.

And then she heard it. A

muffled Iaugh rose from deep
in the brush, and the sound of
running feet.

That horrid rabbit.

Alice began to cry.
