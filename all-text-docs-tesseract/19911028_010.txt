she thinks it is “A-OK. We need
something in the Union to bring a
sense of humor to the Cafe, and
make it not so boring.”

Other students, like Gail Ruff,
are not pleased with the new addi-
tion. “I think it’s a useless noise
maker, but a good foot massager if
you re upstairs studying-- the floor
vibrates.”

Noise is a concern, Brown
notes, and some have commented
that the noise is irksome when in
the Wilson Room, located right
behind where the jukebox is in the

says that the Union may look into
moving it to a place in the Cafe
where it would not disturb meet-
ings in the Wilson Room.

Does the jukebox infringe upon
auditory rights? According to Paul
Tong, “the good thing about the
jukebox is that you can sit down
and listen to music whenever you
have the money to do so; however,
when you sit down for some quiet
you have to listen to whatever other
people want to listen to.”

Marshall Smith pointed out the
jukebox’s total lack of treble/bass
balance and suggested that holes
need to be put into the mechanics
in order to compensate for the

dominant bass tones.

The selection of songs cur-
rently in the machine has not
pleased all students, but there is a

“suggestion box which students are

encouraged to indicated their
musical preferences.

Junior Wilson Hardcastle
commented that he’s glad the juke-
box is here, “but it needs less 70s
Pizza Hut songs.”

Some students have noted the
capitalist tactic of the jukebox to
speel out unwanted tunes at ran-
dom intervals in order to catalyze

‘people into inserting money to hear

music slightly more pleasing. Will
sucha tactic encourage students to
invest their money into this noise-

Faust “don’t think it’s important
enough to spend actual money on.”

Whatever the current problems
might be, Rudell said that he was
pleased with the way that the fresh-

get the administration to consider
this idea.
