Blues Traveler & Rush

Release New Compact Discs

By Chip Petree
Blues Traveler: Travelers &
Theives

The biggest fad at Davidson
College last year wasn’t the moun-
tain-bike-boom or the suddenrush
to get into a pair of roller blades,
but it was the music of Blues Trav-
eler. One could hear the jangling
beginnings of the band’s song,
“But Anyway”, from any party on
the courtat least three or four times
(along with Widespread Panic’s
everpresent “Coconuts”).

The concert in Johnston Gym
on December 8th of last year fi-
nally opened Davidson’s not-too-
choosy ears to what Blues Trav-
eler was all about: downright funky
blues with the overpowering wail-
ing of John Popper’s harmonica.
Well, Popper and the rest of the
Travelers are back with their sec-
ond album from A&M Records
entitled, Travelers. and Thieves, a
work that provides a deeper look
into the band’s unique style of rock/
funk/blues songwriting.

The album begins with “The
Tiding”,aspacey barrage of sound
that leads into the first real track
entitled, “Onslaught”. This tune
opens with a funky exchange be-

tween Bobby Sheehan’s bass gui- _

tar and Brendan Hill’s drums, but
the funk is soon melted by a no-
ticeably heavier guitar sound from
Chan Kinchla. The song remains
quite heavy until an acoustic gui-
tar break ends the track.

The next track, “Ivory Tusk”,
exhibits a Led Zeppelin influence
in a very heavy chord break with
Popper’s harmonica filling in the
emptiness in the tradition of Jimmy
Page. ““What’s For Breakfast”, is

very reminiscent of the firstalbum
in both the mix of the instruments
and the interplay between all four
musicians. “I Have My Moments”
features an acoustic guitar and Pop-
per’s vocal skills in an upbeat,
jangling tune that is neatly fol-
lowed by “Optimistic Thought”,
another cheerful song in which
Popper exclaims “We’ re just spin-
ning on some granite/ that we’d
like tocall a planet/and if youneed
to contemplate/ well here’s an
optimistic thought.”

Theeighth track, “SweetPain”,
and the tenth track, “Support Your
Local Emperor”, both follow in
the mold of “Crystal Flame” from
the first album, yet they, like much
of this record, lack the build-ups to
the high-speed jams that are easily
the highlights of the first CD. The
final track, “Mountain Cry”, is a
slow blues song that features a
guestappearancc on the Hammond
organ and vocals by Gregg All-
man.

Two tunes on the album,
however, seem oddly out-of-place.
“The Best Part” sounds like a typi-
cal, formula song that is quite
boring and uncreative, while
“Bagheera” sounds like a bad out-
take from Paul Simon’s Graceland
album.

Blues Traveler’s debut was one
of the strongest to come out in a
few years, and even though this
effort is good, it does not quite
measure up. Those people wanting
to hear “But Anyway” will find
some solace in the ninth track “All
In The Groove”, which features a
nice little vocal break, but overall,
this album will not appeal to the
casual BT listener.

Rush: Roll the Bones
I have been a fanatical Rush
fan since I was in the fourth grade,

and have since watched the band ,

progress from the rocking Hemi-
spheres and Moving Pictures al-

bums to the much tamer sounds of |

Hold Your Fire and Presto. Ru-
mors would always precede each
new album such as “Neil Peart
(the drummer) has cancer” and
“Yeah,man, this album is gonna
have lots more guitar on it.” But,

nevertheless, Neilnevercontracted | —
a fatal disease (thank god) and the J.

albums grew weaker and weaker
with the constant infusion of key-
boards by bassist/keyboardist
Geddy Lee and the gradual disap-
pearance of Alex Lifeson’s once-
Strong guitar playing. Yet, no

rumors were heard before the re- &

lease of the band’s seventeenth
album, Roll the Bones, meaning
either thatno one cares anymore or
that something has changed.

Once more under the produc- :
tion of Rupert Hine, Bones sounds | —

much like the. previous album,
Presto. The first track, ““Dream-
line”, is an upbeat song that does,
in fact, exhibit a slightly heavier
sound than previous efforts. This
is followed by “Bravado”, a slower,
light. song that unfortunately is
reminiscent of weaker works. The
title track sounds similar to some
of the work on the band’s 1984
release, Grace Under Pressure.
Lee and Peart exhibit the tightrela-
tionship between the bass and
drums that has long held them as
the best individuals in their fields.
Lifeson’s acoustic guitar alsoadds
a nice touch that is accented by a
