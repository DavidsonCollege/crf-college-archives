Ease senior anxiety with a
trip to the Careers Office

BY ELIZABETH HOWE

Lurking in the back of most
Davidson students’ minds is a
troubling question—”What am
I going to do when’! finally
graduate from this place?” The
anxiety resulting from this
question is perhaps most bur-
densome for seniors, but it af-
fects freshmen, sophomores
and juniors as well. In the
search to resolve this problem,
a good place to start is the
Careers Office, located on the
lower level of the College Un-
ion.

According to Carol Jordan,
director of the Careers Office,
her staff focuses its efforts on
three main areas to help stu-
dents make _ vocational
choices--testing, career plan-
ning and placement. The writ-
ten tests that the office admini-
sters include the Strong-
Campbell and Myers-Briggs
tests, which are designed to
provide students with infor-
mation about their personali-
ties and their career interests.
Testing is also the function of
the computer program known

as SIGI-Plus. Its purpose is to
determine a student's “career
interests based on his or her
values,” Jordan explained. The
results give provide “hard evi-
dence” of the role values will
play in the selection of a career.

To further aid in career plan-
ning, the Careers Office has its
own library consisting of
books on such varied topics as
resume writing, job and in-
ternship hunting, interviewing
and securing virtually any
type of job, whether it be serv-
ice-oriented or for profit, in
America or abroad.

In this library is also located
what Jordan refers to as the
“jewel” of the Careers Office--
a print-out of the Alumni Net-
work. This network is made up
of over 500 Davidson gradu-
ates who have volunteered to
help the Careers Office. Cur-
rent students can look up their
city and locate the names of
alumni to whom they can write
concerning employment op-
portunities.

For those Davidson students

“Gimme Shelter” and “Sym-

choice of songs represented
very well the different phases
of the Stones career. It in-
cluded the psychedelically-
influenced numbers like
“Paint it Black” and “2000
Light Years From Home,” and
paid tribute to their blues in-
fluences with “Midnight Ram-
bler’ and a cover of the blues
standard “The Little Red
Rooster.” There was even a
nod to country with “Dead
Flowers.”

short break near the end,
though Jagger left the stage for
a while to let Richards sing on
“Before They Make Me Run”
and “Happy.” After the break
they came back to really get the
crowd going with “Jumpin’
Jack Flash” and “Satisfaction.”
A fireworks display followed,
allowing the band to get out of
the parking lot while everyone

Throughout the concert the
band members seemed to be

ing.

Although this may not be the
Stones’ finest hour, they
proved they can still play and

istill are rock n’ roll.

THE GROUND

Peee
ttt t

ate school (this applies to a
majority of the student body),
the Careers Office has a print-
out of alumni presently pursu-
ing graduate study. These
print-outs are updated twice
each semester. In addition
there is a library of books on
graduate schools and sources
of financial assistance.

One of the main responsibili-
ties of the Careers Office is to
administer the LSAT, MCAT,
GRE and GMAT. Counseling
for test-taking is also pro-
vided.

While much of the Careers
Office staff's time is allotted to
helping seniors, there are a
multitude of activities tar-
geted at freshmen, sopho-
mores and juniors. According
to Jordan “It is beneficial for
students to take advantage of
the testing opportunities as
early as freshman year,” so as
to help students attain a sense
of direction for their college
experience.

Jordan recommends becom-
ing involved in college activi-
ties “as soon as possible,”
adding that not only will this
help students develop them-
selves and their interests, butit
will also begin to fortify their
resumes, which becomes in-
creasingly important as stu-
dents approach graduation.

Sophomores are encouraged
to explore the resources of the
Careers Office in their quest to
determine a major as well as to
secure an internship if desired.
In the junior year, the Carcers
Office becomes more “action-
oriented,” stated Jordan, as its
staff seeks to help juniors nar-
row down their career inter-
ests.

Finally, for those about to
graduate, senior seminars and
workshops are. offered, re-
cruiters come to the campus
and seniors begin to see the
proverbial light at the end of
the tunnel.

An appointment with the
office staff will hopefully dis-
pel some of that anxiety which
all students experience as they
realize that there is indeed life
after Davidson.
