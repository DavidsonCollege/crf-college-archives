Camera Club Members Bible Class Elects
Enjoy Being Shutterbugs Tony Dick President

The picture of a dog lying in front of an ROTC officer
may have caused some Davidsonian readers to think of a

canine show. But to members

of Davidson’s “‘Camera Club,”

that picture was a humorous sign of photographic skill.

Hank Daniel, the author of that
picture, is the president of the
Camera Club this year. Judging
by the time that he spends in the
Watt’s basement dormitory, he is
a very busy member; and judging
by the fact that he was recently
reelected president of the Camera
Club, he is a very important mem-
ber.

This year, the Camera Club has
sponsored a national photographic
exhibit (which was on display in
the Union) and a photo contest. A
third school project was to take
pictures for Quips and Cranks.

However, if you can push your
way through the mess into Swain
Loy’s office, you'll find that some
of the late-deadline mess he is in
was caused by the negligence of
would-be staff photographers of
the Camera Club. Perhaps if stu-
dents want their annual in time
next year, they had better join

tion of her as one of the ten
Women of the Year for 1945.

In 1948 Miss Tnebom was again
cited for her accomplishments,
this time by Upsala College, which
awarded her an Honorary Doe-
torate of Letters.

In the summer of 1950 Miss The-
bom also appeared abroad at the
Glyndebourne. Opera festival in
England, playing Dorabella in Mo-
zart’s “Cosi Fan Tutte.” While
there, she received word that she
had been chosen Best Female Vo-
ealist on the air in Musical Ameri-
ea’e poll of 700 critics in the U.S.
and Canada.

Recently Miss Thebom has been
heard in her world premier per-
formances with the Philadelphia
Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy
of “Medea,” a dramatic cantata
written especially for her by the
noted composer Ernest Krenck.

She also scored resoundingly in
the role of Baba in the Metro-
politan’s American premier of
Stravinsky's “The Rake’s Progress,”
and appeared as Herodias in the
New York Philharmonic's _ per-
formances of “Salome.”

Harriet Johnson, New York Pest,
wrote, “To say that Miss Thebom
is magnificent is to give her no
Jess than she deserves,” and Vir-
gil Thompson in the N.Y. Herald
Tribune called her “One of Ameri-
ca’s most voluptuous voices!” In-
deed, Blanche Thebom may be con-
sidered one of the great singers of
our time—or of any time.

Dormitory Bandit
To Be Executed May 6

Jennings Fields, celebrated dorm
bandit who terrorized the Davidson
campus during February, 1954, has
been sentenced to die in the elec
tric chair for the murder of a
DeKalb County (Ga.) patrolman
during a dramatic flight from the
law in March of last year. The date
of the execution will be May 6 in
Atlanta.

Fields was apprehended by 9

long arm of the law and fled across
the North Georgia countryside un-
til seized in the suburb of Cham-
blee, whereupon he assassinated
one of his captors and critically
wounded another.

French Lady Is Guest .. .|Dr. Benfield . . .

~ Starring in this comedy were
Fred Summers as the slick-tongued
gentleman thief, Bill Kuykendall,
his sticky-fingered valet, John
Harmon as the drowsy victim, and
Albert Harris, the excitable and
indignant police inspector. The
piece was exceedingly well done
and provided several good jaughs.

Next, Joe Conarroe read a paper

on the contemporary § French
author and philosopher, Jean
Sartre, and - briefly explained

his idea of existentialism, a sub-
ject few understood, but which all
proclaimed to understand, ob-
viously in an effort to impress our
delightful guest.

“The Contemporary French
Novel” by Henri Peyre, Sterling
Professor of French a Yale Uni-
versity, was then discussed by
Frank White with comments by
Dr. Watts.

After a brief interval, the room
and its occupants were jarred as
John “Carmen” Harmon bounded
in, dressed in a reversed bathrobe
and rose, and proceeded to bump
and grind his way through “Ha-
banera” from the opera “Carmen.”

After everyone had laughed
heartily at his asinine antics and
distressingly off-key voice, all
settled down to listen to Sabine
as she talked informally, in French,
about the differences and similari-
ties of France and America.

When the discussion turned to
dating and boys and girls in gen-
eral, everyone’s ego was considera-
by bolstered as we learned that
there wasn’t any real difference
between the French and American
male, ;

Alter several stilted questions in
French from the students, the
Madams and Madamoiselle retired
to the kitchen and election of of-
ficers for the coming year was
held with Fred Myers, Larry
Trotti and Steve Huntley being
elected president, vice president
and secretary, respectively.

Refreshments were then served
and everyone gathered around
Sabine to query her in not-so-
stilted English about various things

tioned at Gary Air Force Base in

and Dr. Sam Newell will also be
available to answer questions pro-
posed by students attending.

Following the banquet in the
dining hall will be a formal élosing
worship in Lingle Chapel con-
ducted by Rev. Harry Moffett,
from Gastonia. The closing exer.
cises will be over at 7:30 p.m.

The entire program has heen
planned to yield practical results
for those students who are plan-
ning or thinking toward a profes-
sion in the ministry; it will offer
the chance of conversing with out.
standing churchmen of varied
faiths.

The meeting should prove in-
valuable as a means to draw pre-
ministerials closer together Jn a
relationship with one another in
Christian love.

Those who have not signed up
or have not been contacted and
wish to attend, please see Harry
Petersen, Joe Greer, or Jim Cov-
ington by 12:00 Saturday for a
reservation.
