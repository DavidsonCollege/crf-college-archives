Faculty Meetings Stay Closed
A motion to open faculty meetings to students
as observers at Lehigh University has been referred
to the Educational Policy Committee there for study.
The motion also included statements that. obser-
vers could be granted the floor by majority vote and

‘

that the meeting could be closed at the discretion
of the chairman or by a majority vote of the faculty

members present.

Meanwhile at Hofstra University two seperate
organizations of black students crashed a faculty
meeting. As the students entered the room, there
were cries for immediate adjournment, and a philoso-
phy professor who tried to use the microphone was
prevented from doing so by the black’s leader, who
said he was dissatisfied with the progress made in
meeting the groups’ demands.

Vanderbilt Asks Abolition Of Blackballing
The Fraternity and Sorority Committee at. Vander-
bilt University has recommended abolition of the
blackball and sophomore rushing in its recent report.
The committee recommended that fraternities
either persuade their nationals to allow them to elimi-
nate the blackball or else obtain an extension until
the next year’s national convention. The report said

i

that fraternities forced to go local would be urged to
remain as local fraternities on the Vanderbilt campus.

However, the SAE representative at a meeting
of fraternity presidents and others at the SAE house
where the report was read said, “We're going to
fight this thing pretty hard, and we hope other fra-
ternities will join us. The recommendations here will

really weaken our system.”
One Sigma Chi also

pointed out that getting a

blackball waiver from his national “would take a

generation.”

Taxes, Sick-Leave Rapped
As Cooks Air Grievances

Eleven of 2 fraternity
cooks, treasurers from sev-
eral fraternity houses and
members of the committee
trying to raise cooks’ salaries
met May 8 to catalogue
grievences.

The purpose of the meet-
ing was to hear the griev-
ances of the cooks directly
from them.

Randy Phillips, one of the
heads of the committee. said
that there were four main
grievances brought up by
the cooks.

One of these. complaints
concerned the nature of the

withholding procedures of
some of the houses. Several
of the cooks at the meeting
said that they were unaware
of their gross pay. Some
said that they did not know
how much the fraternities
were taking out of their pay-

checks for various taxes and

Social Security.

Another complaint center-
ed on the sick leave policy
of some of the fraternities.
A few cooks said that they
were not paid for time-olf
due to illness. Others ex-
plained that the fraternitics
which employed them re-
quired that they find substi-
tutes if they were sick and
that they themselves pay
their substitutes.

Several cooks, however, ex-
pressed much satisfaction for
the sick leave policy of their
respective fraternity.

Phillips said that a third
complaint raised by some
cooks related te their ‘inabi-
lity to find employment over
the summer.

was that several of the cooks
did more than just cook. A
few said that they also wash-
ed dishes and cleaned up the
basements in their respective
houses.

The cooks did not mention
anything concerning the ade-
_quacy or inadequacy of their
salaries. °

bers of the committee last

The possibilities of stan-
dardization, through the col-
lege. of sick leave policies,
of clear statements of
salaries, gross and net, and
of vacations was discussed.

The standardization would
enable the cooks {o know
how they stand with their
own fraternity. .

Phillips said he doubted
that ‘the purely moral ap
peal would work’ at some
houses, but that such recoim-
mended guidelines: might be
more effective.

The pulsing rhythms, blaz
ing colors. and counterpoint
of images of ‘Butterfly’
combine with the recurring
butterfly motif to give a
sense of epiphany in which
common objects and patterns
take on a_ surreal signifi

The film sometimes pre
sents 8 frames at once, push-
ing the viewer's perception
to its limits.

“Cayuga Run" paints the
Hudson River's moods in
grainy film and unnatural
greens and purples. The
nervously jumping camera
work which characterizes
Miss de Hirsh’s style gets
in the way of the calmer
moods, although it strength-
ens the more lively ones.

tie the images together in a
sort of stream of sub-con-
sciousness.

Insights are at times pro-
found. A scene of expanding
concentric circles and ma-
chine rhythms cuts to an
eastern mystic and mechani-
cal human chants, and back
to machine rhythms and an
array of candle flames: the

End, said that he felt that
the small number of David-
son students on hand was
indicative of the general
amotnt of interest in the
international students on
campus.

Britisher Michael Lunn
commented that he thought
the college ought to provide
more opportunities for the
students to give information
about their homelands.
“After all. that’s what we're
here for, isn't it?" Lunn said.
“to broaden the Davidson
student's experience."

“We can come to classes in
sociology. geography and
political science. for example,
and tell about our home
countries. said Norkela.
“The professors would con-
tact us and ask us to come
if we could be useful to thair
classes."'

German Ralf Schaefer
came up with the idea of
having coffee hours during
chapel period to meet with
interested students. which
would be similar to the Ger.
man department's Stamm.
tisch.

“The fraternity assign-
ments have worked out very
well,’ said Schaefer, ‘but
the international students
should be rotated among the
fraternities once or twice a
week, with some kind of
bull sessions after supper.
These would be at houses
other than the student's home
fraternity,"

Norkela also advised that
the roommates for interna-
tional students be more care-
fully selected, in particular
that they be ready to help
the students adjust to David
son. °
“It would be better if the
prospective roommate be a
brother in the fraternity to_
which the student is to be
assigned,” said Norkela,
“and if he had a car, that
would help a lot with our
transportation problem."’

Schaefer suggested that the
prospective ropommate read
the foreign student's bio-
graphical sketch and write
him a letter, so that the
foreign student would know
someone when he got here.

Norkela ended the evening
by saying that while fresn-
man camp might be good
for Davidson students, it was
not ‘really very helpful to
foreigners.
