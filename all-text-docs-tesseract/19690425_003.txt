Labor Mediator
Aids Penn State

Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity is experimenting with
labor mediation techniques
as a means of mitigating dis-
putes on ‘campus.

Nationally known labor me-
diator Theodore W. Kheel
was invited to the campus
by economics professor Ja-
cob Kaufman and spent a
day talking with students,
faculty, and the president.
Eric A. Walker.

At Kheel’s recommenda-
tion, Penn State instigated
an office for student discus-
sions last week which Kheel
described as an organ “to act
as a commission agent be-
tween the student body, fac-
ulty, and administration.”

The function of this office
would be to “channel the stu-
dent demands to appropriate
decision-making authority for
prompt action,” he said.

Kheel also suggested the
appaintment of, a mediator
acceptable to all interests
who would assist the flow of
dialogue between them.

Other proposals have been
made to solve campus dis-
putes. Washington education
consultant George Arnstein
encouraged the foundation of
a “campus consulting coun-
ell to advise college admin-
istrators who are under fire
at a meeting of American As-
sociation for Higher Educua-
tion held in Chicago last
month.

President Nixon has ‘in-
structed the Department of
Health. Education and Wel-

fare to plan some program to
ease campus disputes.

Legislation establishing fed-
eral mediation procedures for
campus disputes is now be-
ing drafted by the staff of
Rep. Edith Green (Dem.).
chairman of the House Spe-
cial Education Subcommittee
studying campus violence.

With the aid of a Ford
Foudation grant, the Amer-
ican Arbitration Association
will soon open a center for
dispute settlement, which
would take on all types of
public conflicts.

Barlier efforts by labor ne-
gotiators in the feld of stu-
dent conflict: have had mixed
results. They were unsuc-
cessful in efforts made at
San Francisco State during
the recent four month strike
there. .

Mayor’s
Board
To Meet

The Mayor's Community
Relations Committee of Da-
vidson will hold an open
meeting at the Community
Center on West Griffin St.
Monday evening. May 5. at
7:30.

The Mayor's Committee, a
biracial reconciliation board,
will listen to any complaints
or questions members of the
community wish to present.

“We hope that holding the
open meeting in the black
section will make the people
more willing to speak out,’
said Mrs. Mildred Lowery, a
Committee member. “Too of-
ten they just gripe to thern-
selves and when anybody
asks them what needs to be
done, they say. ‘Oh, we can
put up with things like they
are, I guess’.”

Mrs. Lowery said the Com-
mittee also plans to investi-
gate housing problems in the
community and to provide
information on home finac-
ing and open housing laws.

A talk on preparing chil-
dren for college and obtain-
ing loans and scholarships
will also be presented at the
meeting.

Blood Drive
Closes Gym

Johnston Gym will again
close its doors to physical ed-
ucation students and open
them to blood donors next
week, as the Red Cross con-
ducts its second blood drive
of the school year.

The blood drive will take
place Monday and Tuesday
of next week, with hours
scheduled from 11 a.m. to &
p.m.

The ROTC department,
which annually sponsors the
drive, will offer merits for
all students giving their
blood, and fraternities will
compete as in the past.

and 11 and 12:15 on Friday
and Saturday nights.

ers. ‘‘In fact, they’ve just cut
a record for Decca and have
high hopes for its success,”
Krehbiel said.

“Erica, Eros, and Young”
is a relativeiy new name for
the trio, which used to be
known as “Sounds Unlimit-
ed.’ ‘They dropped _ this
hame because they felt it sug
gested a hard rock musical
group.”’ Krehbiel said: ‘They
like to classify themselves as
harder than folk but not hard
rock.""

Erica Schmitz is the solo
vocalist, of the trio. She is
an experienced singer whose
voice, according to Krehbiel.
has ‘‘a sweet. crystal clar-
ity.” The two men in the
group are Jon Adelson, lead
guitarist, and Dick Seale.
bass guitarist and composer.
They stress the vocal rather
than the instrumental aspect
in. their music.

They have performed re-
cently at the University of
South Carolina, Lenoir ‘Com-
munity College, Appalachian
State, and last week at Gas-

ton College where according
to Krehbiel, ‘‘they were very
well received.”

“They'll do a lot of origin-
al material as well as some
original arrangements by
some well’ known groups.’
Krehbiel said. And they'll al-
so combine humor with their
music.

“We're hoping that this
last Hungry d of the year will
be a big success. A big prob-
lem though will be Spring
Frolics coming on the last
two days of the act. We hope
that students will bring their
dates to one of the shows at
the Hungry d before going
to their respective fraternity
parties.”

CAMPAIGN SHIFTS GEARS

The voluntary ROTC campaign took to
the walis of Chambers recently as posters
lined the halls. Slogans such as “ROTC is
good business. Invest? your son,” and “‘Peace

is not possible on earth. So quit trying,”
may be seen. The ROTC issue is currently
pending before the faculty. (Staff Photo

Lehmann Cuts Schools,
Student Protest Tactics

While defending the de-

during their protests against
college administrators, Dr.
Paul Lehmann, who spoke

Princeton Adds Women
To Undergraduate Rolls

Princeton University trus-
tees voted to admit women
to the undergraduate school
for the first time in the
schools 223-year history last
weekend, and also decided to
add recent graduates to the
university’s board of trustees.

The new trustees, who are
to be elected by students and
recent graduates for four
year-terms, will join a board
whose median age is above
60.
Two trustees are to be
elected this spring.

At Vanderbilt University
in Nashville, Tenn., sentors
ate preparing to elect a
trustee who will take office
after graduation.

The class is to choose be-
tween three nominees ‘for

board of trust approved the
additional trustees last fall.

Classes of °66, ‘67 and °68
will alse alect one trustee
each. since the trustee ac-
tion was retroactive to the
class of ‘66.

Norainees are chosen by
a nominating committee ap-
pointed by the president of
the Vanderbilt Alumni As-
sociation.

California universities.

He claimed that the uni-
versities are not “doing the
human business.”

However Lehmann said of
the students that the tactic
of taking over campus build-
ings to make points and to en-
force their demands was
wrong.

“Fr can tolerate interrupticn
but not disruption.’ he said
of the student takeovers. Leh-
mann expressed part of his
concern over student take-
overs of campus buildings by
criticizing their conduct once
inside the buildings. He noted

as especially nefarious the
destruction of college files by
students.

In spite of his dislike of stu-
dent disruptive tactics Leh-
mann did not place all ‘he
blame for campus disruption
on the students. He also crit-
icized the way in which ad-
ministrators have dealt with
the students in the past.

“We need to find some bet-
ter way out other than clob-
bering people with police
clubs." Lehmann said. Ue
added, “That doesn't help

. calling the police is not
the answer... I don’t know
what is.”

Essay Hits ABM

Davidson (professors Wil-

the ABM system in the latest
issue of the natfonal maga-

sis.” ~

Both men agreed that ar-

be effective, liad to speak to
the merits and demerits of
the defensive system as
claimed by its proponents.

The purpose of the article,
according to Jackson, is to
“take apart the anti-Chinese
rationale’ offered in defense
of the anti-missile system.

Jackson and Fuller argue.
that the reactions from Rus-
sia and China which are apt
to follow the deployment of
the ABM offset the value of
going ahead with the pro-
gram.

Jackson said the Chinese

ly resort to building ‘‘more
exotic’ offensive weapons, a

There is, he said, some log-
ic to keeping the contest on
the ICBM level of sophistica-
tion, which the U.S. has mas-
tered.

The article which appeared
in “Christanity and Crisis’
was actually written some
time ago, but day to day
changes in the ABM debate
have forced continual rewrit-
ing.

Jackson said they had to
extensively rework the piece
in order to counter Nixon's
new rationales for the ABM.

Both Jackson and Fuller
have written for national
journals before. Jackson
writes occasionally for the
“New Republic,’ and Fuller
has appeared in “Orbis,”’ a
journal which discusses the
issues of arms contro! and
