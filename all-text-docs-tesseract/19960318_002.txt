result of Independent Senator John Hollan’s resignation, which was

many draws on my time that some of my activities had t to fall. SGA
was one of them.”

was named Honor Council Chairman, and Charlotte Hildebrand was
named Secretary for the coming year. Hatfield ran for the position

I look forward to my duties as chairman,” she says.

Students and faculty discuss the
future of recycling on campus

By KirstEN RECKNAGEL
Assistant News Editor

The recycling effort at
Davidson has had its ups and
downs, according to the current
Reachout Recycling Coordinators.

But Meredith Judy, one of
three new coordinators appointed
this semester, is “convinced that
[campus recycling] is going to grow
from here.” Her optimism is due,
she says, to the fact that “so many
students are interested in environ-
mental issues, and everyone is be-
coming more focused and in-
volved.”

Ifthe results of the recent Earth
Summit, held in late February, are
any indication, the recycling orga-
nizers can afford to make such
predictions.

The Summit drew a number
of student and faculty attendees,
including Bob Collins, Director of
the Physical Plant and Kurt
Holmes, Director of Residence
Life.

Students in attendance in-

cluded Recycling Coordinators
Seth Clippard, Tom Guthrie, and
Judy, as well as SGA President
Warren Buford and Reach Out
Coordinator Catherine Turner.

Organized by Helen
Robinson, last year’s Recycling
Coordinator, the Summit was de-
signed to provide an opportunity
for direct discussion between stu-
dents and faculty involved in
Davidson’s recycling efforts.

Of the meeting, Robinson
says, “I thought it was very suc-
cessful. It wasn’t all good news,
but the people from the Physical
Plant let us know the logistics. We
learned that we’d have to go in a
different direction [in terms of re-
cycling] than we’d thought.”

“We discovered at the meet-
ing,” says Judy, “that we actually
weren’t making that much money
[off of recyclable material] because
our recyclables are often contami-
nated.”

Contamination might include
the presence of non-recyclable ma-
terial mixed in with recyclables, or

improperly prepared recyclable
materials. For example, in order to
earn money on recycled alumi-
num, all aluminum cans must be
crushed. Likewise, all cardboard
must be flattened, or no money
will be earned.

Asaresult, explains Robinson,
“we plan to head toward a smaller
and better-run recycling effort.”

Next year the campus will re-
cycle only four items, aluminum,
plastic, paper, and cardboard. The
recycling committee’s focus will
be on maintaining the quality of
these recyclables, resulting in
greater earnings. Only uncontami-
nated aluminum and cardboard will
be worth money.

“Hopefully,” says Judy, “the
money will eventually go back into
recycling toimprove the program.”

Also among the long term
goals discussed at the Summit is a
reduction in the use of glass, which
will still not be recycled next year.
Students and Patterson Court
houses will be encouraged to use
aluminum instead.

SGA
prepares
to storm
dorms

NARESH NAGELLA
Assistant News Editor

Students should expect to run
into their SGA representatives a
lot this week — the senators will
be coming to the dorms.

It is all part of Dorm Storm
96, an SGA initiative that ifftends
to help foster a more direct and
definite means of communication
between the student body and the
SGA.

“An important factor about

. Dorm Storm is how it is a means

for writing a report for the use of
other student organizations and the
administration which clearly out-
lines issues important to students,”
says President Warren Buford. .

Senators will be assigned a
specific dorm to “storm,” and will
talk with students about their con-
cerns. Then they will write a report
which will be reviewed by the Poll-
ing and Response Committee of
the SGA. That committee will
then come up with a comprehen-
sive report.

“Tt should result in an effec-
tive means of ensuring the student
voice will be heard,” says Sopho-
more Senator Robert Knight.

He adds, “I know it will make
sure I talk with people other than
my friends allowing for a more

_ complete student voice to be

heard.”

After the week ends, the SGA
will go over all the concerns raised
by students and to try to incorpo-
rate as many of them as possible
into their official agenda.
