American Energy For Our Future The Persian Gulf
War: "This Is The

By David Smyth '92

I hope that our government,
including both the executive and
legislative branches, is learning the
indisputable lesson from the crisis
inthe Persian Gulf: Thatlesson, in
case ithas escaped anyone with all
the hoopla over the war, is that
dependence on foreign oil is fatal
to our citizens in several ways and
that a decent energy policy is ur-
gently needed.

The United Statesi is ina quan-
dary right now because of precau-
tions we have not taken. Our in-
volvement in the Middle East at
least partly results from a need to
protect our oil interests there and,
thus, our fragile economy. Itis no
secret that we are in the midst of a
full-fledged recession these days.
Even the George Bush and Alan
Greenspan have started to aban-
don the euphemistic “temporary
lull in activity” for more realistic
terms. So.there we are, slugging it
out in the desert to. keep crucial
oilfields:in friendly hands.

Yet, this is not the only reason
forasensibleenergy policy, though
it may be the most immediately
compelling one, Our natural envi-
ronment would benefitimmensely
if we were to switch our focus to
alternative fuels such as natural
gas and solar and wind power.

Also, huge amounts of American»

capital would be staying in the
good old.U.S. of A. rather than
feeding the proverbial hand that is
getting ready to bite us.

_We sit in-the middle of mas-
sive, «untapped. energy sources
every time we go out to the Lake
Campus to read or throw a frisbee.
The sun that draws us out there in
the first place is an endless supply
of heat and light even with no
human intervention. With tech-
nology that is already available,

is this: if the U.S. were able to

unity.

We spend inordinate amounts
of money on petroleum no matter
how much a barrel of crude oil
costs. Throwing energy dollars
outside the country is folly when
our Own economy so desperately
needs internal stimulation. Does it
make sense to anyone to pay exor-
bitant prices.for oil to dictatorial
states thatcould be assembling their

a novel idea to search for energy
resources within the bounds of our
own nation, hiring our own people
who need the work? This argu-
ment should not be misconstrued
as a xenophobic reaction to non-
‘Americans, but merely as a com-
mon sensical approach to making
America stronger.

be in the long run. Obviously we
should play the role of the media-
tor in conflicts if invited to do so.
But we are generally disliked and
sometimes hated in the region and
would do well to stay out of harm’s
way by intervening ofly when we
absolutely must. We cannot do so
while we are forced to pander to
the producers and controllers of
crude oil. We could save the lives
of real, live people if we only had
asensible energy policy.

That the United States should
be able.to empower itself is so

“obvious that it should not require

substantiation. The lack of discus-
sion aboutthe subjcct is even more
disconcerting when one considers
that we will revert to our old habits
once the war is over if basic atti-
tudes arenot changed in the people

now to prevent environmental

suffocation and a repeat of the.-

Real Thing"

By John Burns '92
It is 12:30 in the morning,

around one wee, after the begin-

ning of the Gulf War. I have just
last

opinions, both for and against
military action. Everyone has an
opinion. But it seems to me, that
amid all the prognosticating, pos-
tulating, threatening and opinion-
ating that went on before January
17th, one thing was overlooked . .
. that this was going to be a real
war, with real people really dying.
This is no Ortmayer poli-sci game,

no Nintendo, or even Libya. This -

(Coke theme, please) is the real
thing. This fact is clearer now that

. the shooting has started. It wasn’t

that clear when you look back on
editorials ofeve2 short weeks ago.

Saddam has proven himself wor-

_thy of his reputation, and his de-

struction.
However, my two jubilant

_ hawks, let us not forget who made
this tin-pot bully into a “world

menace.” Oh yeah, the very coun-
tries, almost to the man that are .
now fighting him (except, of
course, cowardly Germany). My,
butdoesn’ that moral ground begin
to feel soft.

There are other moral issues
on the agenda. What a nice ally we
have in Hafez Assad--if you hold
him up to a light and look real
close, you’ll see Saddam glaring
back at you. And the Palestinians-
-like it or not, Hussein achieved
“linkage”--something will havc to
be done for them.

But more importantly, and I
think this is much more casily scen

Kyle and Seth, your moral ground which you
so trumpetingly hold, will quickly turn into a

sink hole.

I, like many others, find ithard
to put down thoughts on an event
sO momentous. But one of the
pieces in The Davidsonian struck
me to write. :

Seth J. McLaughlin and Kyle
J. Kinner (just how do you both
hold a pen at the same time?) once
again proved themselves quite
capable of taking someone else’s
thoughts, rolling them around in
their heads a little, and spewing
them back out again in hardly-

altered form. Yes, Kyle and Seth, .

for once your beloved right wing
has found moral ground it is ca-
pable of holding. As Time maga-
zine (Jan. 28) said, “If there is such
a thing as a just war, George Bush
has unleashed one on Saddam
Hussein.”

Fine and dandy. But a war of
any magnitude, especially one this
big, isnot something to gorushing
into with a “hooray, now we fi-
nally get to do it right!” attitude. I
find myself wondering if anyone
has seen our two editorialists in
line at the local recruiter’s office.

As I write, there are millions of
gallons of crude oil flowing into
the Persian Gulf. Itis adisaster 12

times the size of the Exxon Valdez

spill! Buteven this tragedy palesin
comparison to the human loss. This,
my friends, is a terrible war.

_ By opening those oil faucets,

. by torturing American pilots, by.

forcing 4 million Jews to don gas
masks (think of it . . .) and by
_ continuing to fighta hopeless war,

‘outside of the States, Amcrica has
justdonea 180-degree turn. “Since
when,” peopleare asking overhere,
“has the U.S. been on the side of
International Law?”

Ahem ... Kyle and Seth... do
you recall a certain World Court
decision that was ignored by the
White House? Do you remember
U.S. support for El Salvadoran
death squads? Pinochet? Duvalier
[sic]?

Boy this ground is sinking fast.

One thing isclear.George Bush
has: seen fit (and it can only be
weakly disputed, rightly so) to go
to war--real, horrible, ugly, brutal,
bloody, cruel war--to enforce the
will of the United Nations ata time
when it corresponded with the
economic interests of the United
States. The next time a defense of...
the “new-world order” comes
about, the U.S: had better once
again be on the front line of the
struggle. Whether or not it is eco-
nomically good to do. so. Whether
Or not there is oil at stake.

If not, Kyle and Seth, your
moral ground, which you so
trumpetingly hold, will quickly tum
intoa sink hole. And youcan crow
loudly while we watch you sink;
with all of the post-war hopes of
American moral leadership, and
all of the gallons of sacrificed
American blood.
