Elections

One of man’s greatest failings is that he too
frequently critizes his fellows, usually unjustly
and always behind his back. Being far from
perfect, we are quite often guilty of that*here
at Davidson. But the condemning feature of
it here is that the objects of our criticism are
campus leaders whom we have put into office, or
whom we have let someone else put into office.

Yes, you’ve guessed it. Elections are coming
soon. In about two weeks, to be exact, some
six hundred men will be filling out ballots in as-
sembly every morning. And in all probability,
a large per cent of these will be voting just as a
matter of routine instead of a. seriously con-
sidered duty.

In our election system the feature about which
we boast so much—the absence of politics
in one way a disadvantage. The qualifications
of the candidate are not presented to the student
body. Therefore the only way in which a voter
can get this information is on his own initiative.
If you have not done so already, look around,
see what goes on, ask those who are in a posi-
tion to know, and from your observations, make
a serious, conscientious attempt to discover the
best men to carry on next year.

system a force of prime importance in carrying
on our student government, which has long been
one of our foremost claims to being a great col-
lege. At the bottom of that student govern-
ment, as democratic and complete as any that
can be found, is the honor system.

From dormitory life to classroom to off-cam-
pus dealing the honor spirit has characterized
the Davidson man. The graduate of Davidson
knows that he has left something behind which
he may never find again. He remembers it as
the greatest contribution Davidson made to him.

Exchanges coming into the Davidsonian Post
Office box show that many schools, once proud
of their honor system, are beginning to note
signs of decadence. Editorials are being
written, y ideas and set-ups are being tried,
and in a few the honor system has been entirely
discarded. Occasionally we hear someone say,
“The school is going to the dogs,’ or, “The
honor system is breaking down,” but we are
glad to note that these are decidedly in the
minority. There are violations of the rules, yes,
‘and always will be, but these are even fewer
than they were a year ago, thanks to the work
of a strong Student Council, headed by Fred
Stair.

This editorial isn’t intended to support any
cause or bring about any sweeping reforms. It
is just a deserved pat on the back of the student
body. We are justly proud of a fine student
government and honor system. Let’s stay that
way.

The appreciation of the whole community goes
to Coach Norman Shepard for the way he
handled an overflow crowd at the Wake Forest
game. It is a difficult situation dt best when
some fifteen hundred people want seats in our
“cracker-box” gymnasium, but it is only fair
that students and faculty members have first
choice.
Also thanks to the basketball team for giving

such a splendid game and congratulations
to the student body for holding in check most of
its impulses to boo the officiating and opposing
players. Considering the circumstances and the
fact that as the game progressed the tension
in the atmosphere could not only be felt but
almost seen, our conduct was very good.

Campus Comments

This coming Monday spring elections will get
under way with the opening of’ nominations for
the presidency of the Student Body.

Members of the three upper classes who have
witnessed such elections before have undoubtedly
been duly impressed with the privilege and duty
of their right to select their leaders for the com-
ing year. It seems to be traditional with David-
son that politics be kept at a minimum, thus
securing the election of officers on the basis of
their qualifications for the job.

However these approaching elections will be
somewhat different since an amendment to the
Constitution last year conferred freshmen
the right to vote in all elections held during the
second This means that some two
hundred votes will be added to the former total
of previous elections.

on

semester.

The main objections forwarded last year
against extending the vote franchise to the fresh-
men class in the spring elections was that as
first-year men they were unfamiliar with many
upper classmen eligible for offices and, in ad-
dition, that they would be too easily influenced
in the casting of their ballots.

Consequently in the coming elections the freSh-
men will be saddled with the heavy responsibility
of meeting and disproving these criticisms. In
this first test it is particularly urged that each
member of the class of 1942 consider his vote as
an individual right and duty appraising care-
fully each choice on as impartial a basis as pos-
sible.

The success of the next school year is de-
termined, to a great extent, by the outcome of
these spring elections. May everyone cooperate
by giving his attentive deliberation in each elec-
tion, and let the common good of all be the
guide of each!

With peace as their keynotes,

earth and good will to men,” as the University of
Wisconsin “Daily Cardinal” said.

Thes“Cowl” of Providence College put it this

Letters To The Editor —

Dear Bill,

I wish to make a brief statement to
those in the catagory of Mr. Fun-
Lover, and also to suggest that if Mr.
Fun-Lover-were not in the minority,
perhaps he would not mind backing
up his ideas with his signature.
Personally, I don’t think he has the
right idea concerning our chapel periods,
although, because I am new here, prob-
ably no one will take me_ seriously.
Nevertheless, I don’t believe that a
worship of God can be a_hali-way
affair. It must be all the way or not
at all. Listening to the readinz of a
few verses from the Bible one minute,

and then theowing some person across
seats the next is my idea of a half-
way worship of God. If we are to
receive any true benefit from a Scrip-
ture reading, we must give it a care-
ful, quiet, concentrated thought, and
not throw carefully prepared advice to
the four winds merely for the’ sake
of keeping in step with a few of our
impulsive neighbors.

At present I feel that our daily serv-

ices are of a half-way nature, and
surely this isn’t the true Christian
spirit.

Sincerely,

Bill MacLauchlin.

BIG YEAR...
few of the older annuals just the other

night, we happened to pick one of the
year 1918. Aside from a military con-
flict which terminated along about that
time, there are a couple of other items
which make the year worth recalling

for today’s students, we found. For
one thing, this was the class that
graduated no less than four of the

present faculty. Maybe you can identi-
fy them from the following extracts
taken from those brief sketches such as
were wont to appear under each sen-
ior’s picture—one of the hazards of
graduating in those days. See end of
column for the correct names, and don't
expect to get them all.

(1)“...1f the celestial universe for
gets to follow its orbit some day, just
ask; .And as for his puns
it’s dangerous to get within range of
them.”

(2) (Editor of the Annual)

It gets by us here he can read so much

and “camouflage the profs on

class.”

(3) (Business manager of Davidson-
ian) “Did you ever notice that straight
path from the front steps of Georgia
to the Chemistry Lab? Well, here we
have the perpetrator of it... Some day,
however, DEON is going to find that
missing atom.

(4) “Shades Oe Apollo Belvidere!
What a good looking man!... has been
caught glancing at a book three times
this year... rival of Christy Mathew-
son.”

Something else you might like to re-
call, doubt, is the
score of a football game of that school
year: Davidson 73- Wake Forest 7.

WORD TO THE “UNWISE”..

with a sigh, no

There’s an interesting article in the
latest Reader’s Digest, taken lfrom
Scribner's, on the subject of hitch-

hiking, which, of course, is a sort of

minor sport at Davidson. This is

from the Driver’s viewpoint, and the
thing that caught our roving eye was
the author’s expressed preference of al-
most any kind of bum, from sword-
swallower to religious fanatic, to the
college youth. The author, Mr. Ber-
gen Evans expresses himself thus:

“College boys, on the other hand, are
rarely interesting. They spoil the nat-
ural charm of their ignorance by trying
to be charming. They are little Dale
Carnegies and proceed to put you at
your ease.”

There’s enough truth in that to cut
a little, we suppose. Still, after all the
nice people who have told us they
wouldn't think of picking up anybody
but a Davidson boy, this comes as
something of a shock. It’s sort of
discouraging, when you think it over.

SUBTLE...If you wandered around
the first floors of the dorms on “visit-
ors’ day” last week, you probably en-
joyed yourself. Even the most near-
sighted guest could probably have dis-
cerned, though, that things had a slight-
ly unreal, staged appearance. We are
thinking, aside from the general tidi-
ness of the apartments, of the texts
left stragetically open on numbers of
desks, evidently just layed aside. Per-
sonally, though, we thought the boy
who let himself be caught typing Latin
poetry and his roommate who dis-
played a neat sign, “We Love Our
Faculty,” might have been overdoing it.

CONCLUSION ...Somebody suggests
for the offertory selection at vespers
“Penny Serenade”... Then there’s the
boy who says he plans to go over to
Charlotte Saturday and take in “To-
bacco Road” and the Holy Land Ex-
hibit. Says he thinks it will leave him

and culturally.

Oh, yes, the faculty men are: (1)
Prof. W. N. Mebane, (2) Prof. H. T.
Lilly, (3) Prof. O. J. Thies, and (4)
Mr. F. W. Hengeveld.

You have probably heard of the
student who went to school several
years and lost so many hours by
cutting classes that he came out in

the hole, but here is an authentic
case in which the collegian actually
broke even for one semester,

It seems that a Texas Technologi-

cal College student enrolled for a
total of 11 hours. Finding that his
load was too heavy he dropped one
of these. When the semester was
over he had flunked nine more and
received so many cuts that he lost
the one he had passed. And so
he was back where he started, even
with the college! :
