n to Davidson staff

Yet with the demise of the frater-
ity system as it was and the
bolishment of compulsory vespers, a
iajority of professors have noticed a
ecrease in friendliness among stu-
ents.

“We never get together anymore,”
aid Dr. Charles Ratliff. ‘‘And there is
loss of the small community of
‘jiendliness. It was an unwritten rule
hen I was a student, we never met
nyone without speaking.”

Dr. Locke White voiced a similar
pinion: ‘Compulsory vespers and
1apel were the common. experience
mong students that is just not
resent now. Asaresult, thereisa
iarked difference in the community
‘eling at Davidson.”

In expressing concern over the

“THOMAS THOMPSON, LIFE

diminishing religious commitment of
the college, Dr. White noted, ‘‘There
was, it seemed to me, a missionary
commitment of the place and I

wonder, I worry, whether Davidson
is so successful that it has lest the
seeds of its success.”

However, many professors cited
the importance of the college’s ties
with the Presbyterian Church. Dr.
Dan Rhodes characterized this senti-
ment: “I really believe—and it’s not a
front, however it may appear on the
surface—that the association between
Davidson and the Presbyterian
Church has been a wholesome rela-
tionship, for the profession of faith or
recognition of the part faith plays
goes hand in hand with intellectual
endeavor and curiosity. Each stimu-
lates the other and makes for well-
rounded growth.”

In addition to these religious ties,
the unique student-faculty relations
were characterized by some professors
as ‘‘distinctly Davidson.” ‘“‘Davidson
makes the most of its smallness,’’
said Dr. Charles Cornwell.

“This has been accomplished in the
very real and important relationship
between faculty and students that has
stressed belief in our respect for other
people and a commitment to the
discussion of ideas.”

Dr. Rhodes reiterated, ‘‘At the
heart of what I see as Davidson is a
genuine concern of faculty members
for students as people—and it works
the other way too.”

Yet the most striking aspect about
these professors who have returned to
Davidson is that, despite some simi-
larities, each views Davidson diffe-
rently in relation to their own
individual experiences.

“You mustn’t look at Davidson
idealistically,’’ said Dr. Epes, ‘‘then
you can’t view change objectively. If
you can’t look at Davidson through
the students’ eyes, it’s time to retire.
That doesn’t mean that you must give
way to every student’s whim, yet try
to see things as they do.”’

Previe

T & M Express, reminiscent
of the intimate coffeehouse
performers, evoke ‘‘the time-
warped beginnings of prede-
cessors Simon and Garfunkel
or Peter, Paul and Mary...”

Tim York and Michael
Hawthorne, both native Tex-
ans, combine their musical
talent to create their own
sound. It reveals people, their
own lives and the country with
a “synthesis of the essence of
folk, country, and rock mus-
ic.

The Expressmen exhibit ex-
ceptional talent as separate
musicians. Hawthorne’s facil-
ity to write songs won hima
$5,000 award at the American
