The Art Tatum archives have
finally been expanded to a number of
volumes which is proportionate to the
greatness of the jazz artist. For too
long the selection has been slim and
the recordings poor.

But Pablo Records has released a
set called The Tatum Group Master-
pieces, consisting of several records
exhibiting the talent of Tatum on the
piano and featuring many other jazz
greats.

* Two of the records feature alto
saxophonist Benny Carter in quartet
with Tatum. These records contain

traditional blues like ‘‘Blues in C’’ and »

numbers that were becoming classics
like ‘‘S’Wonderful” and “A Foggy
Day” by George and Ira Gershwin.

Ben Webster joins Tatum on one of
the other albums. He maintains a
smooth sound on the tenor sax as
Tatum lets loose on some of his
amazing improvisations. Outstanding

cuts on this record include Cole
Porter’s “Night and Day”’ and Will-
iam Rogers’ ‘‘Have You Met Miss
Jones?”

One of the most interesting in this
masterpiece collection is the record
which teams Buddy de Franco with
Tatum. De Franco rose to greatness

favorites like ‘‘This Can’t Be Love’’
and ‘‘Makin’ Whoopee..:’

Another album matches Tatum
with the superb trumpet of Roy
Eldridge. Eldridge played with many
groups including the Duke Ellington
orchestra. He and Tatum play Elling-
ton’s ‘‘In a Sentimental Mood” as
well as more Cole Porter and ‘You
Took Advantage of Me,’ a song
Tatum mastérfully plays on the solo
album put out by Capitol.

Finally there are the trio albums -
Tatum on piano backed by drums and.
bass, Red Callender plays bass and Jo
Jones the drums as Tatum astonishes
with his skill that begins to make
things sound simple they are executed
so smoothly.

Any of these new albums is worthy
of being added to a jazz collection.
The sound is actual stereo, and is very
clear, much more so than the sound
on some of the other Tatum record-
ings. The combos are small enough to
feature each musician and the indiv-
idual tone of his instrument.

The mood conveyed on all of these
albums is one of confident relaxation,
perhaps a smoke-filled studio and
shirtsleeves. All the songs were
recorded in the early fifties.

With the release of this library of
Tatum’s music perhaps he will grow
in popularity and more people will
come to appreciate him as one of the
greatest pianists in jazz.
