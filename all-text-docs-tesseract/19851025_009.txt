Friday, October 25, 1985 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Tennis Center opened, plans revealed

By EDWIN PAGE

Last Saturday Davidson Col-
lege took its first step toward con-
structing a complete sports com-
plex with the dedication of the
new Louise and Carl Knobloch
Tennis Center.

The Knobloch Center contains
four synthetic polymer surface
courts which provide space for
year-round play. The glare-free
indirect lighting coupled with ad-
vanced heating and air-condition-
ing makes the courts amenable to
play at any time — day or night,
winter or summer. The facility
also includes student locker areas
and showers, an enclosed viewing
area, and office space for
women’s tennis coach Caroline
Brown.

The new tennis center was
named in honor of Louise and Carl
Knobloch, grandparents of
Eleanor and Emmy Knobloch of

the classes of ’82 and '84, respec-
tively and parents of the principle
donors, Mr. and Mrs. Carl Knob-
loch, Jr. of Atlanta. Another
major donor is the Stowe family of
Belmont.

“The Knobloch Center is a tre-
mendous addition to already out-
standing Davidson tennis facili-
ties,” men’s tennis coach Jeff
Frank said.

Brown agrees, “From a re-
cruiting standpoint I have already
seen it as a positive influence on
prospects. It’s one of the best col-
legiate facilities anywhere.”

Just as exciting as the opening
of the new Knobloch Center was
the announcement of plans for a
total sports complex that will con-
tain, in addition to the tennis cen-
ter, a 6,000 seat arena for basket-
ball, a natatorium with olympic-
size pool, a diving tank, and spec-
tator seating area; a multipurpose

floor area for everything from
aerobics to weight training; and
administrative space for the
coaching staff and other depart-
ment personnel.

The seats of the arena will be
retractable, providing much-
needed space for intramural and
recreational uses. The extra floor
space will also make it easier for
Davidson to establish women’s
volleyball, currently a very suc-
cessful club sport, as a new varsity
sport.

Along with providing David-
son with a more attractive facility
to aid basketball recruiting, the
6,000 seats in the arena (up from
2,500 in Johnston gym) will help
the college in many ways. The
arena will allow the Cats to bring
attractive Division I opponents to
campus, playing the big games at
home and not in the relatively un-
familiar confines of Charlotte.

Also, the proposed arena
would alleviate the question of the
feasibility of Davidson using the
new 20,000 seat coliseum in
Charlotte. Finally, it provides for
the needs of the college for now
and into the next century.

The natatorium will allow the

"college to reestablish swimming
and diving teams that, despite
their success, were discontinued
because the school lacked an ade-
quate facility.

Chairman of the Board of
Trustees Ben Craig said that the
Knobloch Center is evidence of
Davidson’s “commitment to
men’s and women’s sports, to
providing the finest facilities and
to providing the opportunity to
participate in lifetime sports to all
students.”

Davidson athletic director Kit
Morris concurred. “Plans for con-
struction of the new sports com-

plex at Davidson are a continua-
tion of a predominant theme on
campus — commitment to excel-
lence. I think the Board feels a
strong sense of timeliness and a
deep commitment to move for-
ward.”

While delays in this type of
project are certainly not unheard
of (i.e., the new basketball arenas
at both UNC and Westem
Carolina), Morris expressed op-
timism that the project would be
ready for use by the fall 1988
target date.

Although fund raising is still
largely in the organizational
stages several major contributions
have already been received.
Along with those mentioned
above, The Belk Foundation of
Charlotte, and Mx. and Mrs. John
Baker of New York City have
contributed significantly.

Who's On First ?

The Condon, Leibrant conspiracy

By ANDY BARRON

There’s a conspiracy going on
in baseball right here at peaceful
Davidson College. A conspiracy
the NCAA would love to hear
about and will after this reporter
spills the beans. Junior pitcher
Steve Condon has been pitching
professionally for the past several
years under the assumed name of
Charles Lei brant.

Neither Condon (Leibrant)
nor Davidson baseball coach Geo-
rge Greer could be reached for
comment.

Though NCAA rules do not

allow an athlete to participate in
college and professional ranks
Simultaneously, the athlete must
be playing a different sport profes-
sionally than the one being played
at the college level. This loophole
might be applied to Condon’s case
since Condon throws right-han-
ded for Davidson but left-handed
as Charlie Leibrant for the Kansas
City Royals.

The NCAA refused comment
until their pending investigation
has been completed. However,
one long-time baseball observer
said, “I don’t see any problem

with Condon’s situation since he
approaches professional ball as a
lefty and college as a righty. It has
to be okay that way. As long as he
doesn’t want to hit like he did in
the World Series, I think he’ll
continue to fit in at Davidson.”

The left-right discrepancy be-
tween Condon and his alter ego
also explains why he hasn't been
too tired to pitch at practice every
day and in the World Series. Con-
don’s means and schedule of tra-
vel between Davidson and the var-
ious locations at which the Royals
play has yet to be explained.

The amazing aspect of this
story has to be how Condon has
been able to keep his secret for so
long. Fortunately for Condon,
Davidson's low profile nationally
and the Royals’ obscurity to
people in North Carolina make for
a very smal! number of people that
would see both Kansas City and
Davidson in action.

Unfortunately for Condon (or,
should we say, Leibrant), the
Royals made both the play-offs
and the World Series. In addition
to extra schedule juggling, Con-
don/Leibrant exposed himself as a

Royal to local fans and it didn't
take long for the bubble to burst,

The consequences of Con-
don’s actions could be far-reach-
ing in their effect on Davidson
baseball. Condon most likely will
be ruled ineligible to play
baseball. In addition, Davidson's
baseball program could be put on
probation, a horrid prospect that
would darken the previously
glorious outlook on the 1986 sea-
son. Such is the price of a scam as
complicated and devious as Con-
don’s.
