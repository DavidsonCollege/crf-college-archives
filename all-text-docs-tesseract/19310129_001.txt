Physician

Large Field is Open

Lawyer, Engineer, and Doctor Tell
Greatest Thrill They Have Known

At Y vespers, on January 18, Dr. Oren
Moore, baby specialist of Charlotte, deliy-
ered a straightforward and inspiring address
to the assembled students. His subject was
“Choosing One’s Life Work,”

In his introduction, Dr. Moore explained
that his choice of the above subject was
perhaps a surprising one to’ most of his
listeners, because it was used by so many
lecturers. However, this has not lessened the
need for instruction to students along this
line. There are so many fields of work ly-
ing before the young man of today that he
is flustrated when a definite choice has to
be made. Even the outlook on life work has
changed from what it used to be. The sub-
jects of medicine, law, and the ministry are
no longer considered the only outstanding
and the best of the various subjects, but

Wrestling Team Meets
N. C. State on Saturday

Is First Appearance of Coach
Unger’s Team This Season

On Saturday night, January 31, the first
edition of Coach* Doe Unger’s Wildcat
wrestling squad will make its initial appear-
ance in a tilt with the Wolfpack of State
College. As yet, the capacities of Coach
Unger's team are ‘unknown, while those of
State are comparatively indefinite. In a re-
cent match with Washington and Lee, State
won out in only three weights, but this is
considered very good since W. & L. won
over the Army wrestling team by the score

of 34-0.

This year’s varsity wrestling team includes
four men from the Freshman wrestling team
of last year, the rest being men who have
wrestled on previous teams. Coach Unger
has been working with his squad night and
day since the first of December, but will not
hazard as prophecy as to the result of. the
coming match with State. He does say that
the wrestling schedule is one of the most
difficult ones he has ever seen, and probably
the hardest this college will ever face.

In the 118-pound class, Vick, weighing
120, will start off the. match, Gorham,
weighing 126, will wrestle in the 125-pound
class. In the 135-pound weight, etiher Hous-
ton or Preston will .wrestle, to be decided
by Coach Unger. Either’ Tyack or McDavid
will fight in the 145-pound class. Captain
Conway, intercollegiate state champion of
last year, and defeated only by Packard of
the Army with a time advantage of 5:29
minutes, will wrestle in the 165-pound class.
McFayden will wrestle in the 175-pound
class, while Boyle will wrestle in the unlim-
ited class.

Indicative of the treatment that is to fol- |

low, Dr. C. K. Brown's latest book, “The |

State Highway System of North Carolina,” |
starts off with this story:

!

“Some years ago,” said General William
R. Cox, speaking before a convention at
Raleigh in 1902, ‘I was traveling on a stage- |
coach in Western North Carolina and was
favored with a seat by the driver. I asked |
him whether he always traveled that same
road, He said: “Not in the winter; then [|
travel the lower road.’ Upon my inquiring
of him where that road was, he answered:
“About two feet under where we are travel-
ing now’”,’” :

Beginning thus with the highway condi-
tions as they were in North Carolina in the
nineteenth century, Dr. Brown brings the
story up to date, telling of the first “Good
Movement” the subsequent
struggle for modern highways, ending in the
program undertaken in 1921 and carried for-
ward in the next eight years with the lib-
eral issuance of state’s bonds.

Seniors Partial To

Phi Beta Kappa Key

Athletics Hold Chief Interest and
Are Deemed Most Valuable

The results of a Senior Questionnaire
which was held some time ago are now be-
ing made known, They show the attiutde of
the part of the student body which has been
here the longest, to outside activities, R. O.
T. C., compulsory courses, ete.

The results of the question, “Which extra-
curricular. activity holds your chief inter-
est?” are: Athletics, 29; religious, 6; pub-
lications, 4; literary societies, 3; bulling, 2;
honorary fraternities, 2; music, 2; sleeping,
2; debating, 1; fraternity (social), 1;
1, and rifle team, 1.

The activity deemed most valuable to the
college is: Athletics, 16; football, 15; Y. M.
C. A., 9; literary societies, 3; publications, 3;
golf, 1; fraternity, 1;
and study, 1.

The next question has to do with that

much discussed problem: “Do you consider
Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, or
Varsity ‘D’ the most valuable?” Forty-four
gave first place to Phi Beta Kappa, 18 gave |
first place to Omicron Delta Kappa, and
3 considered the Varsity ‘“D’’ most valuable. |
To the question, “For which one would you
work the hardest if starting over ?” 42 named
Phi Beta Kappa, 13 named Omicron Delta
Kappa, and 7 named Varsity “D”. While the
results of this may be rather surprising, still |
they show that Phi Beta Kappa is recognized |
as the supreme achievement of four years
of study. Also as noted in the second ques- |
tion, if the four years could be begun again, |
college could be started afresh, 42 would |
strive for Phi Beta Kappa in preference |
to the other activities. |

In answer to a questionnaire on R. O.|
T. C., 60 considered it an asset while 5 con-
sidered it a detriment. This may give many
of the Freshmen and Sophomores a ray of |
hope since it shows the fact that almost the |
entire Senior class considered their two
years as an asset.

New Courses

It will be of interest to students
to learn that six changes have been
made in as many semester courses
for the spring portion of the ensu-
ing term, which have not been noted
in the College Bulletin.

Doctor Archibald Currie will take
over Economics Five, heretofore
taught by Dr. C. K. Brown. Dr.
Brown, in turn, will offer a new
course in “Transportation.” Cap-
.tain Norton G. Pritchett will teach
a class in Physical Education again
the second semester, similar to that
taught the first semester, for the
benefit of Junior students, since the
course is an alternate one, and will
not be available next year.

Besides these, Dr. P. H. Gwynn,
new Education and Sociology pro-
fessor, will offer courses in the
Methods of Teaching Mathematics,
and similar courses in Physics and
History. Such courses were men-
tioned in the catalogue, but no
| definite professor was listed as in-
structor, except in two

Valued By Seniors

University of North Carolina is
Favorite Among Other Schools

At the last smoker held by the Senior
class, at which most of the: members were
present,.a questionnaire was submitted to the
group. The questions covered a large field
of diversified subjects. Very interesting re
sults were obtained, one of which showed
that political science is the most popular
course among the Seniors. Some of the ques
tions with the results are:

“What would be your choice of schools
now, outside of Davidson?” The University
of North Carolina was the first choice with
23 votes. Georgia came next with four. Ala-
bama, Dartmouth, P. C., Vanderbilt,
W. and L. next with three each.
the “2” class was Duke, Harvard,

BARIUM SPRINGS
PLEDGES

Nex Monday, February 2, 1931,
the pledges for the Barium Springs
campaign will be collected. This
campaign was initiated last Fall by
the Y. M. C. A, and a goal of
$1,000 was set. Although a great
deal of money has already been
collected, not all of the pledges
have been paid. It is expected that
the full amount will be paid soon
after the effort is begun.
