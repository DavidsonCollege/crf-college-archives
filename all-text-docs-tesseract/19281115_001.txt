Dr. Cumming Editor
Of Old Manuscript

“Revelation of St. Birgitta” a
Critical Study

Dr. W. P. Cumming is the author of a
hook to be published soon, concerning the
discovery of an old manuscript and a copy
of this manusmript. The book will be a
critical study of the manuscript and also
the story itself. The title of the book is
“The Revelations of St. Birgitta,’ and it
is to be published by the Oxford Univer-
sity Press. It was first published during

the fifteenth century by an early English |

text society.
Robt. Garrick, head of a large corpora-
tion, who is also a bibliophile of note, St.
Birgitta was one of the famous saints of
the Middle Ages, one of the few feminine
saints that attained much popularity. Her
native land is Sweden.

“The Revelations of St. Birgitta” is a
discovery of note. It is a fine manuscript

boat in the air is $125 per hour. Another
plane of the same type, owned by the
Texas Oil Company, was at the Char-
lotte field Saturday and was scheduled to
Hp for Houston, Texas, on Sunday. This
plane placed second in the transcontinental

In the flight Saturday, the passengers
included 14 adults and two children. The
colleges were well represented with two
men from Davidson and three girls from

| Winthrop. Misses Zelma and Naney
| Phillips, and Miss Buchanan were the

| Winthrop representatives. With a speed
of about 80 miles per hour, the plane
leasily rose above the trees and headed
ltoward Charlotte. In a trip lasting 15
| minutes and covering a distance of 25
miles, the passengers obtained a good view
!of Charlotte. First the plane circled the
outskirts of the city and then cut across
the business section. The highest speed
was a hundred miles per hour. One time
the plane hit a little air pocket and gave
the passengers a slight thrill, but no harm
resulted. Soon the nose of the plane was
headed toward the field and the flight was
finished with an even landing.

Flights of this plane have stimulated
much interest in Charlotte. Many promi-
nent men of the county have been guests
of the plane’s operators within the last
week and all have been very much pleased
with the safety and comfort of their ride.
With its excellent landing field and with
several of its prominent citizens actively
interested in the business, Charlotte is rap-
idly becoming an aerial center.

posed of W. K. Pritchett, chairman; R.

Definite plans have not yet been worked
out by the committee, but at present the

Aubrey Brown, head of Delta Pi Kap-

was not only partly to stimulate interest in
journalism, but, if possible, to bring out
any latent talent along journalistic lines
that even the man himself does not know
that he possesses. He added that the fra-
ternity is sponsoring this in order to try
to accomplish something on the campus,
that the chapter is trying to remove the
stigma of uselessness placed upon the hon-
