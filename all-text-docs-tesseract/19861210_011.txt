Wednesday, December 10, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

9 season -

around him better.

Billis essentially a freshman because he
didn’t play at all last year. He’s coming
along well and demonstrating an ability to
rebound.

D: Who among the non-starters should
see significant playing time?:

_ Hussey: Dean Keener is easily our most
improved player. He came in more ready to
play this year than any guy who hasn’t
played in the past. He’s going to play a lot
of off-guard and occasionally some point
guard.

Todd Scott will back-up Anthony Tan-
ner. He can put the ball in the basket for us.
He’s worked harder on his defense and be-
come more of an aggressive player.

Dave Fitzgerald is really adding a lot to
our team in practices because if you play
with him or against him or around him
you're going to have to play hard.

D: What about the freshmen?

Hussey: We’re really fortunate to have
talent and athletic ability in our freshman
class. Some of them are more ready than
others; some are not ready at all. Whether
the freshman accumulate a lot of minutes or
not is certainly not indicative of whether
they ’re‘contributing to the program because
they always contribute in practice...

At this point, I think that Maurice Gray

is making nice progress in the fact that he -

has a pretty good grasp of what we’ re doing
offensively and defensively. He’s a good
athlete as well.

Jay Schmitt, a 6-8 inside player, is fun-
damentally sound. He, was well taught in
high school and that’s really helped him a
lot from the offensive .and defensive
standpoints. :

Dick Seidel struggled early, but in re-

4

Class of 1990

Sporting a 35-inch vertical
leap and plans to major in political
science, Hunter’s goals center
around both athletic and academic
ends; however, he said, “I want
our team to go to the NCAA tour-
nament again.”

Maurice Gray

After a memorable high
school career, the 6-5, 205 pound
Gray is ready to “make an impact
on Davidson.” The all-time lead-
ing scorer for Hawken High
School in Warrensville Heights,
OH, Gray was also the Ohio
Player of the Year and named to
first team All-State and All-
County teams. He averaged 28
points a game in both his junior
and senior years with 10 rebounds
per game his senior year.

Hussey said, “Maurice should
have an outstanding career be-
cause he has excellent size,
strenght and quickness.”

Dick Seidel

At 6-6, 230 pounds, Seidel is a
new forward on the Davidson
team. Copming to Davidson from
Flossmoor, Illinois, Seidel was an
outstanding high school player

and shows a great deal of potential
for the Wildcats.

‘ute significantly to the team with

cent practice sessions he has come to life. _

D: How do you feel about the three--
point shot?

Hussey: I think it’s exciting. I don’t
know if its the best thing for basketball or
not. I think basically it’s taking away from
percentage basketball. I think it’s good be-
cause it allows a guy whose short to play
who may not have been able to play before.

D: How important are the Davidson
fans and Johnston Gym to the team’s suc-
cess?

Hussey: I think the fans are terrific. I re-
ally do. We played the Irish National Team
when the students were gone and we played’

the University of the South when the stu- ©

dents were gone and we had pretty good
crowds, but it was like playing at a funeral.
When we pack the students in Johnston
Gym, it really does have an effect on our
team. These players are good representa-
tives of Davidson. They are good students;
they go to classes. They mix and mingle
with other students and they realize that
those people up there in the stands are their
peers.

No one likes to come here and play us.
They really don’t. Especially conference
teams. They hate coming in here. But that’s
the way it should be. It’s important that we
have our fans here, because it really does
mean an awful lot to us.

We've really tried hard to develop a
basketball program that truly represents the
student-athlete. That’s a person whom we
expect to attend classes and work hard as a
student. We’re proud of the fact that all our
players have graduated. They also play bas-
ketball pretty well. We have the type of
player that we hope our students, our facul-
ty and our alums will identify with because
of the type of school we are.

“He has very good athletic
ability and strength and is versitile
enough to play inside or outside
the perimeter,” Hussey said.

Seidel played for Homewood
Flossmoor High School where he
was named MVP his final year as
well as being All-Conference for
three seasons, All-State top ten
and MVP“in Centralia Holiday
Tournament. In his senior year he
averaged 21 points and 12 re-
bounds per game while serving as
team captain.

Jeff Harris

The final addition to the Cats’
team this year is freshman. Jeff
Harris. At 6-7, 230 pounds, Har-
ris will be a back-up center.

Harris is expécted to contrib-

both good size and strength, athle-
tic ability and an outstanding high
school record.

Coming to Davidson from
father Ryan High School: in
Nashville, Tenn., Harris was
selected as an academic All-
American. In his senior year
alone, he averaged 17 points and
12 rebounds a game and blocked
114 shots during his high school
career.
