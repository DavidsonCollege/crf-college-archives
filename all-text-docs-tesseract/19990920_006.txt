MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1999

Turkish Earthquake relief efforts at Davidson

the Red Crescent soon followed.

Housing has proved to be a much bigger problem.
Within days, makeshift camps of tents and tempo-
rary shelters popped up all over the countryside.

The International Student Association (ISA)
held a weeklong fundraiser to aid victims of the
devastating earthquake that hit Turkey in the early
morning hours of August 17, Responding to cries
for help from the Turkish government and em-
bassy, they began by setting up a booth at the
Opportunities Fair on September 1. After a strong
initial reaction, members decided to extend their
efforts. They kept the booth open in Chambers all
the following week, collecting donations and
pledges from students and faculty. During that
time they were able to ‘raise more than $2,800,

crucial to the Turkish economy. Not only were
many large factories destroyed, but thousands of

those who survived have not been to work in
weeks. Rescue efforts and the search for separated

effects on the overall economy of the country are
incalculable.

In contrast, the international response to the
crisis has been timely and extensive. A spokesper-
son for the Turkish embassy in Washington re-
ported that sixty-three different countries have
delivered aid of some kind. However, rebuilding
will require more than just immediate assistance
for the injured and homeless. The Turkish govern-
ment is expected to request loans from the U.S.
and other western countries, from the World Bank,
and from the IMF. In the wake of this tragedy, the
road to recovery will be a long one.
