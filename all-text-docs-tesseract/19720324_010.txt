Synod Launches Fund Drive
_ For Davidson, Queens College

By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

At the present time a cam-
paign sponsored by the Pres-
byterian Synod of North Caro-
lina is underway to solicit funds
for Queens College and David-
son.

The campaign will seek dona-
tions from individuals, Presby-
terian-related foundations and
selected Charlotte businesses
s:arting Jan. 1, 1972, and from
Presbyterians in N. C. from July
1, 1972 to June 30, 1973.

A joint statement released by
Davidson President Samuel R.
Spencer and Queens President
John E. Smylie stated that
“Queens and Davidson share a
joint heritage, a joint purpose,
and joint constituencies. Both
institutions were initiated by
the Presbyterian Church and
maintain their basic Church
commitment.

“At this time in their his-
tories, both institutions need
millions of dollars of capital in
the form of permanent endow-
ment and new facilities if they
are to continue to provide a
liberal arts education of highest
quality.”

eee Faculty Power Monopoly

no effective

(Continued From Page 1)
The body is so amorphous to
begin with. there jis no real
possibility to hold it resnonsible.

This is especially true in the
current debate over the value
of Extended Studies. J- was the
faculty that anoroved this pru-
gram and that presently is ad-
ministering it: yet they blame
the administration and students
for the lack of quality wor! pro
duced in the program.

For all intents and purposes,

his subcommittee, so he has ac-
tually had as much time to pre-
pare a report as we have. It's
clear that they have done very
little work, if any.”

The EPC also took up several
other issues in that meeting.

Bevan said that the EPC
would like to broaden the defi-
nition of a “‘student cn leave”
from just being a student study-
ing at another institution, to a
definition giving some consid-
eration to students who with.
draw from Davidson. He said
Navidson should keep in touch
with students who withdraw and
encourage them to return if
they want to.

“Students who drop out feel
that they may be lost in the
shuffle with freshman applica-
tions if they try to return,” he
said. ‘‘We want to see that, as
former students, their applica-
tions are given special consid-
eration.”

Action was taken on the prob-
lem of transfer credits also. As
it now stands, Bevan said, any
course from any accredited in-
stitution which is equal in qual-
ity and of the same type as a
course which ‘might be offered
at Davidson,” will transfer as
a “«p" or oom

the faculty has
leadership which can pilot pieces
of legislation through; conse-
quently the faculty abdicates
its role as a legislative body
and becomes a mere debating
society. Meanwhile. Davidson
stagnates.

A fourth side effect is
the lack of communication
and persistent inisunderstand
ing among the constituencies.
The present governunce system
encourages after-the fact con-
sultation as well as confusion
as to who is to make what de-
cision.

The result ol chis monopoly
has been a lack of taith and
loyalty in the college not only
from students and administra-
tors. but also from many facul-
ty members as well. There is no
longer any common interest
among the constittiencies, no
productive morale, no mutual

real thing.

Instead of a governan:‘e sy

CERTAINLY THE FACULTY
AS A BODY OF MEN IS NOT
TO BLAME FOR THIS COX.DI-
TION, BUT IT IS THE FACUL
TY CONSTITUTION THAT FAS
CAUSED THE FACTIONALISM.
As long as this set of rules re
mains in effect, the administra:
lion and students will continue
to challenge and whittle away
at faculty monopoly of authori-
ty.

And as long as this process
of king of the mountain con-
linues there will be no happi
ness or progress in Davidson.

‘ Development

Davidson College Director of
D. L. Winston
summed up the campaign by
saying ‘‘The scope of the cam-
paign is to approach friends in
North Carolina who are inter-
ested in Davidson and Queens.
The primary objectives are to
complete funding of the E. H.
Little Library, to increase en-
dowment and to secure funds
for union facilities.”

Winston went on to state that
“This does not necessarily mean
that these funds will be used to
build a new union; depending
on our needs that become ap-
parent in the next few years,

an existing building mighi be
renovated.”

Winston further stated that
an increase in endowment was
essential to hold the line against
tuition increases, since the cost
of an education has been rising
at 10 per cent per year for the
past four or five years.

Chairman of the’ fund is
Graeme M. Keith of Charlotte,
executive vice president of the
First Unica National Bank of
North Carolina. Keith chaired a
committee that promoted a
$13.9 million bond issue in Char-
lotte in 1966. Keith is a David-
son alumnus.
