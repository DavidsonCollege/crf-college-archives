By ERNIE SHIPE
Sports Writer

Before the Christmas holi-
days John Pecorak must
have been a pretty disap-
pointed boy. In his first two
games the 6-6 center had con-
tributed only 14 points and
had been in constant foul
trouble.

Tuesday night was a com-
pletely different story. John
poured in 25 points and rip-
ped off 18 rebounds. John’s
quick rise is quite symbolic
of the entire team’s meta-
morphosis.

“Before the holidays we
were a _ disappointing ball
club," commented Coach Bo
Brickles. ‘‘The team really
changed after the break and
we're beginning to look like
an impressive team. We're
more stable now, particular-
ly on’ defense.”

According to Brickels this
change has beén common to
him in his work with fresh-
men at Rice. ‘‘'The hardest
adjustment a kid has to make
is changing from high school
to college basketball,’ added
Brickels, ‘‘The team really
a boy up for a game in high
school. but when he gets into
college more things enter into
his life.”’

The 100-76 win over Wingate
placed all fivé of the David-
son starters in double figures.
Ray Brown leads the. Wild-
kittens With a 19.3 average.
Brown has been deadly from
the field as he has connected
on 50 per cent of his shots,
The 5-9 guard from New
Orleans was Davidson's first
and it appears the
coaches have. found a_ boy
who can direct the Wildcat's
offense in the future, In all

recruit

the games Ray has shown
considerable adroitness as. a
ballhandler.

Following Brown in  scor-
ing is. Joe Sutter, This highly
touted forward from Marion,
Indiana, has been one of the

most consistant and all-round

member of the squad. Joe
has hit on 22 of 44 shots while
averaging 19 points and 11
rebounds,

“Although he only scored
14 points against Wingate
Joe had his best game of the
season,” commented  Bric-
kels. ‘‘He played a_ particu-
Jarly strong game on defense.

In high school Joe led- his
team to a 28-1 record while
earning all-state honors for
himself. He was also a mem-
ber of the Indiana-Kentucky
all-star game and was re-
cepient of the Trestle “Award,

the second best award an
Indiana basketballer can
earn.

A wing with striking simi-
larities to Jerry Kroll, both
in appearance and_perfor-
mance, is Gordon Graham,
This freshman from Pella,
Iowa, boasts a 13,7 average
with most of his field goals
coming on long jumpers shots
much like .Kroll,

“Gordon has not been shoot-
ing that well, but has shown
he is an excellent shooter,”
adds Brickels. ‘‘His shot se-
lection has ‘not been that
good and he also needs to
improve defensively.”

Davidson has to compete
with Iowa and Drake for
Gordon's services. In high
school Graham scored at a

28 point clip. He is also a
top-rate tennis player.
With his perféfmance

against Wingate John Pecor-

ak brought his average to Mp.

points per game. The strong
center from Farfax, Virginia,
is an excellent rebounder
as he is averagins 10 per
outing. Also his 60 per cent

shooting ability has been
quite impressive.
Bo Brickels hopes John

has now found himself. *‘Tues-

day night we were getting
the ball to him which we
hadn't done before and he

was going to the boards real
well,” commented Brickels.

Clearing The Desk

BY DON PARMAN
Sports Editor
The basketball season has proved to be an ex-
citing one so far, with all the experts, and even myself,
looking forward to a wide open scramble for the top
spot, a refreshing change after the way Lew Alcindor

and UCLA dominated

e game the last three years.

South Carolina started off as number’one and that
lasted precisely until they met Tennessee on the Game-
cock’s home court. Tennessee parlayed a tenacious
zone defense and only five players (hadn’t South Caro-
lina seen something similar to that recently?) into a
one point win. USC rooters were back to calling their
team number one after stopping North Carolina, but
most people still need a lot more convincing.

Meanwhile old Adolph Rupp had his own brand
of Wildcats all set for another shot at the national
title. But then Adolph Rupp always has his team all
set up for another title. The Kentucky boys led by
Dan Issel beat North Carolina earlier to pass South
Carolina when the Gamecocks were toppled by the

Vols.

St. Bonaventure showed the nationwide television
audience that there really are good big men left,
even without Elvin Hayes and Alcindor hanging
around. Bob Lanier, big from the words size 19 shoes,
dropped in 50 points in crushing Rick Mount and
Purdue. St. Bonny’s is unbeaten.

Then there were the “up and down’ clubs. Da-
vidson climbed toward the dizzying heights before
losing to St. John’s and then nipping Georgia by only
two. Ohio University cashed in on Big Ten teams to
rise to number five before getting gunned down by
Texas. Marquette and Dusquesne dropped out of
sight after early and frequent losses. Tennessee was
dropped from the unbeaten ranks and the top ten

with their first loss.

Just when it seemed that the sports writers would
have to throw up their hands in dispair and concede
that they might have to name a new number one
team every week, along came Johnny Wooden and
his merry band of UCLAns to save the day.

Meanwhile the South Carolina Gamecocks have
taken all the chances they intend to take. No tickets
have been made available for Davidson fans in the
game between the two teams in Columbia on February

11. :

Gordon Slade, who has been on the receiving end
of a lot of coaching there at Davidson, will take a
crack at giving the instructions himself this spring.
Slade will serve as baseball coach in February until
head coach Tom Stevens finishes the swimming sea-

son.

Slade will be shooting for his second Southern
Conference batting title when the season gets under

way.

Three Key Losses Mar
Stevens’ Swim Outlook

By BILLY COBB
Sports Writer

The Wavidson College swim-

ming team __begins—its—fifth
season under Coach Tom
Stevens with a home meet
against Clemson University
on Jan. 23 attempting to
match last year’s recerd, an
even 5-5 slate.

However, Coach Stevens
will be without the services
of several important individ-
uals. Junior Bill Woodson,
who was the top scorer last
year, is still recovering from
a bout with mononucleosis
and may miss the entire sea-
son. Also, the Wildcats ‘will
be without diver John Braw-
ner and senior letterman Ed
Bartle who both have decided
not to participate this sea-
son:

“Even though we will be
weak in depth and experience
as a result of these losses,
captain Mac Davis returns
and will give us added
strength in the freestyles,”
commented Coach Stevens.
Davis a senior from Jack-
sonville, Fla., holds the school
records in both the 50 and
100 yard freestyles.

Doug Stott, junior letterman
returning from a year
abroad, will offer strength in
‘the butterfly. Other key re.
turnees include backstroke
man John Cronin, breast
stroker Kurt Geisinger, in-
dividual medley man Jim
Wins, and sprinter Jim New-
ton. According to Stevens,

job.” :
Meanwhile Smith is looking
ahead to next fall's football
team with a great deal of
optimism. The biggest strong
points in the Wildcat out-
look are the defensive unit,
the experience of the offen-
sive linemen and the speed

that next year's squad pro
mises. Despite the loss of
several senior standouts

Smithy said, “We could be
better at every position next
year.”’

cats are in the—offensive

While Smith said, “We can

with no sophomores,” a
strong freshman team is be-
ing counted on, at least for
depth.
