THE BIG ONE

TUESDAY NIGHT is the big one for Davidson’s out-
standing freshman basketball team.

That's the night the Duke frosh tip into Johnston
Gymnasium at 6:30 for a return match. Back in Decem-
ber the Duke yearlings clipped our Driesell-recruited ex-
perts, 77-71, in Durham, and ever since then the Wild-
kittens have seen red whenever the name Duke has been
mentioned.

The frosh have been pointing to this one for so long
that they are somewhat like assassins, who have thorough-
ly plotted the murder of some famous celebrity, and are
now just waiting in ambush for the right moment to kill.

In a sense, the Blue Imps are celebrities; and in a
sense, they are in danger of being killed some Tuesday
night. Ask freshman players from Furman, South Caro-
lina, North Carolina, Wake Forest, etc.

Actually, this will be the third time this season that
the ’Kittens have been out for revenge. In the two prev-
ious revenge bouts against Wake Forest and UNC, they
were successful.

The importance of the game may be seen in the
following three statements: if the Kittens win, they will
have an 11 game winning streak; if they win, they will be
able to say with pride that they beat everybody on their
schedule; and if they win. they will undoubtedly be con-

sidered the best freshman team in these parts, and pos:

sibly the whole South.

The Blue Imps, sporting a 7-foot giant among their
talented cagers, are considered the best freshman team in
the basketball-minded Atlantic Coast Conference. Since
we are regarded as the cream of the Southern Confer-
ence crop, Tuesday night would be as good a time as
any to disprove Wake Forest freshman coach Jackie
Murdock’s theory that Davidson College ‘is still not
ready to compete against ACC teams.”:

We suggest that everyone in the student body be on
hand for this big one Tuesday night, regardless of re-

views, writs, etc. We think you'll enjoy this planned mur- ,

der, and we don’t think Duke will return to Durham
known as the big one that got away.

CANTY CHOOSES CANADA

Furman’s talented quarterback Billy Canty has sign-
ed a contract with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian
Football League.

Canty, who hurled four touchdown passes against
Davidson in this past fall’s game in Greenville, was the
fourth leading passer in the nation’s college ranks this
past season, and was instrumental in the South’s victory
over the North in the Senior Bow! Gamé at Mobile, Ala.

Following a 83-65 loss at
the hands of Furman last
night, the Davidson Wild-
cats strive to get back on the
right track tonight in Gas-
tonia’s Wray Junior High
School gymnasium, where
they meet Erskine for the
second time this season.
Tipoff time is slated for
8:15 p.m.

The ’Cats travelled to Green-
ville, S. C., last night, and were
beaten by Furman for the sec-
ond time this season. D. G. Mar-
tin was high for Davidson with
18 points, while Terry Holland
and Haywood Evans contributed
13 and 10, respectively. Suffer-
ing with the now prevalent “flu
‘bug,” top scorer Bill Jarman
managed only 7 points.

The Paladin attack was pac-
ed by everybody's All-Con-
ference Jerry Smith, who
tossed in 36 points, and by
the league's top rebounder,
Gerald Glur, who scored 21
and havted in 21 rebounds.
Tonight's foe, Erskite, was

victim number ten of the now
historical twelve-game winning
streak, which VMI ended last
Saturday night, 68-66, on All-
Conferenee Norm Halberstadt’s
last second whirling jump shot.

This past Monday night
Davidson recovered from the
VMI loss with a 61-55 upset
ever Clemson on the local
court. Four Wildcats hit in
double figures against the
Tigers including Jarman (17),
Holland (16), Martin (14), and
Bill Beerman (19).

Duke's Depth Dunks
"Cat Mermen, 48-47

BY CHARLIE SHAPARD
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The Wildcat mermen
were touched out by the
Duke paddlers, 48-47, in a
non-conference meet held at
the Blue Devil pool this past
Tuesday afternoon.

Going into the last event, the
400-yd. freestyle relay, the ’Cats
held the lead, 47-41. However,
the Blue Devil relay team prov-
ed too much for the ‘Catfish,
giving Duke 7 points and the
meet.

Following the meet, Coach
Dwight, Shoe said, “The boys did
a good job, but if depth ever
-hurt us, it did so today. You
don't usually lose too many
meets when you win 6 out of 11
events.”

‘ The freshman team also met
defeat at the hands of a power-
ful Baby Imp team, 53-23, as the
Wildkittens did not receive any
first places.

First place winners for David-
son in the meet included the
following: Carter Mebane, 220-
yd. freestyle and 440-yd. free-
style; Jack Hollenbeck, 100-yd.
freestyle; Tommy French, 200-
yd. backstroke; Stefan Young,
200-yd. breaststroke; and the
Davidson 400-yd. medley relay

Big Jim Fuller, Kappa Sig
mainstay, jumped into the in-
dividual scoring lead on the
basis of 21 and 16 points in his
last” two outings. Independent
Mark Dunn, last week’s leader,
dropped to second after a 12
point performance.

This week's I-F checklist in-
cludes the following:

Last Friday, Andy Boggs and
Andy Sherrill pumped in 17 and
15 points, respectively, as the
Phi Delts trounced the Sig Eps,
73-31. Earl Cole’s 21 points
paced the Independents as they
nipped the Sigma Chis, 52-51,
despite freshman Paul Reich-
ardt’s 15 point effort.

This past Tuesday, the deadly
duo of Jim Fuller and Johnny
Rogers hit 16 and 19 points, re-
spectively, as the Kappa Sigs
whipped the Keith Fraser (17)-
led Pikas, 57-45. Ip Roberts hit

They have compiled a 5-7 loop

They have recently been involv-
ed in some cliff hangers, includ-
ing the three point loss to the
‘Cats last week. a one point vic-
tory over VMI, 82-81, and a one
point loss to The Citadel, 58-57.

[Frosh Warm Up For Duke;

Wallop Furman, 70-37

The classy Davidson freshman basketball team rolled
over the Furman frosh last. night, 70-37, in Greenville,
S. C., just prior to the varsity game with the Paladins.

The win, which ran the Wild-
kittens’ win streak to 10 straight
and their overall record to 13-3.
was the frosh’s second triumph
over Furman. They bombed the
Baby Paladins here back in De-
cember, 110-54.

WARMED UP

Thus the ’Kittens warmed up
for their big game this coming
Tuesday night at 6:30 in John-
ston Gym when they face the
Duke frosh in a revenge bout,
which will preeeed the varsity
clash with Richmond.

Back in December, the Duke
yearlings clipped the ‘Kittens,
77-71, in Durham. The Blue
imps are undoubtedly the best
team on the freshman schedule,
and a victory over them would
be quite an accomplishment for
Coach Joe Hunt's club.

In two home games prior to Phil Sqvisr
the Furman contest, the frosh Paul Briggs
rolled over the South Carolina Barry Teague

Big Five Meet On Tap
For Wildcat Trackmen

BY BILL
Davidsonian

PRIDGEN
Steff Writer

Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, a hopeful band of
Davidson trackmen meet Duke, UNC, Wake Forest, and

N. C. State in an indoor Big
N. C.

Coach Heath Whittle express-
ed regret that the meet could
not be scheduled some other
time so as not to conflict with
our Midwinter’s dance weekend.

Whittle commented, “Num-
bers will get us this year. We
can’t expect to do very much
with the number of boys that
are going.” .

in fast year’s Big Five mest,
Devidton took a third place,
beating Wake Forest and
N. C. State, but losing to Duke
and UNC.

The cindermen who will make
the trip include Bob Cordle and
John Sharp, running the 440-yd.
dash and Andy Boggs and Randy
Austin, throwing the shot.

\

Five track meet in Raleigh,

Several freshmen will also
make the journey. They are
Terry Williams, 70-yd. low hurd-
les and 60-yd. dash: Dennis
Phillips, 880-yd. dash; Chester
Davis, two-mile run; Fred Heff-
ner, mile run; and Tom Watson,
60-yd. dash. In addition, Watson,
Williams, Heffner, and Phillips
will run in an eight-lap relay.

Whittle, although realistic
about his team’s chances in
Raleigh, had some real praise
for the boys who will make
the trip, especially Sharp.

Says Whittle, ‘Tm expecting
great things of Sharp this year.
He’s been working very hard,
and he should win the 440 at
Raleigh.”
