SAE senator Will Cowan
updated the SGA on his efforts
to find a place for students who
hunt during the school year to
keep their guns. It violates
school policy and state law to
possess a gun on campus so
students used to keep their guns
at Dean Terry’s home. This is
no longeran option, and Cowan
has been working with the Cam-
pus Police to resolve the prob-
lem. :

Cowan proposed letting
students keep their guns in the
evidence room of the police
station, but according to Cowan,
Director of Public Safety and
Police Ray Thrower “wasn’t
real receptive to it [the idea].”
Cowan has also been working
with the College’s General
Counsel Bart Landes as well.
The old policy of storing guns
off campus is still in use, but
Cowan et al. are seeking other
solutions.

Davidson and the O.J.
Trial

1992 graduate Michele
Carswell has found herself in
the intership of a lifetime.
Carswell is a clerk for the now-

Lance Ito. Working on the O.J.
Simpson case has been the ex-
perience of lifetime, says
Carswell: “It’s an incredible
experience. Every facet of law
is part of this trial. I thought it
would be interesting to be part
of history, but it’s turning intoa
real education. We’re dealing
withconstitutional issues, DNA,
evidence, and procedural mat-
ters in this trial.”

Carswell has also interned

Computer Services to expand

By Jay JENNINGS
Staff writer

In response to the growing
number of colleges that have ex-
panded computer facilities,
Davidson’s Computer Services
recently made a move to modern-
ize Davidson’s computer network.

Coordinator of Academic Fa-.

cilities and Services Lydia
Lorenzin says the “college and the
Computer Center recognized the
need to expand networking.”

She says that the Computer
Center hears questions from cur-
rent students about the possibility
of having network capabilities in
dorm rooms.

To address these requests and
others, Davidson hired Trellis
Communications.

Trellis will assess the current.

network in the next few weeks to
look for the most cost effective
way to update and set up the sys-
tem while allowing for future ex-

pansion. They will implement a.

master plan that will encompass
the next ten years.

Assistant Dean of Students
Leslie Marsicano says that
Davidson is behind other campuses
in computer facilities and is look-
ing for ways to catch up in a hurry.

She says that the College has
already put aside funds for the up-
dating, which will be a very expen-

sive process. The cost is second-
ary, Marsicano says, because there
is “general agreement that the cam-
pus needs to be networked and
students need access from their
dorms.”

The Residence Life Office and
Physical Plant will work with the
Computer Center to update the
network. Installing network ac-
cess in dorm rooms would involve
extensive rewiring and changes to
the dorm rooms.

Lorenzin sees the network
expanding into all academic build-

ings, hopefully providing faculty
with access from their offices.

Marsicano is a member of the
Web Oversight Committee which
will address new issues and poli-
cies that need to be set regarding
the network. Issues such as honor
code concerns on the network and
freedom of speech will be dis-
cussed.

A need has developed for
these new policies because of the
expanding applications and in-
creased use of the network. To

accommodate the increased use of

the system, the Computer Center
recently expanded the number of
modem lines from 13 to 16. Net-
work access in dorm rooms, how-
ever, would make the modems
obsolete.

Lorenzin sees the possibili-
ties of network printing, software,
and other applications. These ser-
vices are now offered in the com-
puter centers.

’ Withthe new system, the com-
puter labs might become more spe-

cialized to offer services students
cannot receive throughthcirrooms.

The faculty has tabled the
Educational Policy Committee’s
proposal to allow students the op-
portunity to minor citing disagree-
ments with the policy, specifically
the need for a minimum GPA to be
attached to the requirement.
“(The mimimum GPA] is
something that the (SGA) Council
on Academic Affairs is very op-

posed to,” says Council Chair Clair
Freeman. According to Freeman,
a limit would prove to stifle rather
than help a student interested in
minoring.

SGA President Bill Gullan
agrees: “I feel that ... taking a
minor ‘in another area of interest
will help students’ overall aca-
demic standing.” He says that pres-
sures from society and parents “‘of-
ten serve to dissuade students from

particular majors because they feel
their interest in a particular course
of study doesn’t look as good in the
eyes of employers and graduate
schools ... The opportunity of a
minor may satisfy the creative
longings of the student while ap-
peasing the external factors that
dictate his or her choice of major
and choice of career interest.”

In support of the implementa-
tion of a minor system, Carol Jor-

dan, the Director of Career Ser-
vices, feels that “any uniqueness
that a Davidson student can present
to a graduate school or an em-
ployer” would increase the
student’s chances to be consid-
ered.

The proposal will be sent back
to the Educational Policy
Council, which will decide what to
propose to the faculty at their next
meeting in May.
