A Little
Respect

By MIcHAEL KRUSE
Assistant Sports Editor

The Davidson men’s
basketball team is in the
midst of one of its best sea-
sons in history and seems to
be well on their way to an
NCAA bid (via victory in
the conference tournament
or otherwise), but the pa-
thetic Belk Arena turnout
still hovers around a thou-
sand fans every game.

Granted, Davidson
scholars comprise a busy
bunch, but two hours on
game night is not going to
make the definitive differ-
ence between success and
failure as a human being.

The Wildcats have four
more home dates this sea-
son, two of which will be
televised live on SportSouth
(Feb. 17 vs. The Citadel and
Feb. 24 vs. Marshall).

Consider them oppor-

tunities to show some school
spirit.

Make signs. Utilize
body paint to the utmost.
Heckle. Be loud, be obnox-
ious, and most importantly,
be there.

Speaking of basketball
teams that don’t get the re-
spect they deserve. The
women are on track to have

their best campaign in his- —

tory and their attendance is
even worse than the guys’.

You’ve. already been
instructed how to remedy
this situation.

While we’ re on the topic
of R-E-S-P-E-C-T, let’s talk
about UMass. Althoughthey
are #1 in both major national
polls, the so-called experts
still address other schools as
potential Final Four mate-
rial before finally discuss-
ing the Minutemen, if ever.
UMass is the country’s only
unbeaten team at 21-0.
Hence, they have so far lived
up to their team motto,
“Refuse to Lose:” And that
mentality, let alone the un-
blemished record, should
count for something. Talent
alone doesn’t win champi-
onships.

On the subject of ridicu-
lously masterful basketball,
the Bulls are 41-4, Through-
out the first half of the NBA
season, Jordan andcompany
have dropped just enough
games to lose a single play-
off series. I’m going to go
out on a limb at this early
juncture and propose that,

mountain and burns in ablaz-
ing heap of destruction, Da

Swimmers
race phantoms
from Emory

By WILL BRADSHAW
Sports Editor

The final swim meet of the season against Emory was
thrown a curveball by the weekend ice storm.

The team was scheduled to leave for Emory on Friday
afternoon, but their departure was delayed by the storm. On
Saturday, it was decided that it would be unsafe to travel, but
that would not keep the ingenious and inventive swim team
from still having their meet.

The two schools decided to swim in their own pools,
and fax their results to each other so they could be compiled
and a winner declared.

“Tomorrow we will know the results,” head coach Rich
DeSelm, said. “We tried to put a positive slant on a difficult
situation. We got some good out of it; anything that we can
get to help people achieve their goals is good. The weather
was just not in our favor this weekend.”

Davidson started their meet at 11, and the Wildcats
were finished by the time Emory had started at 3.

“Tt’s unique to swim a meet like this because of the
weather. It’s a very personal test and it requires a lot more
focusing because you don’t have the other team there,”
senior Churchill Hooff said. “Some people stepped up and
swam well today despite that and when you can do that it

builds a lot of confidence in your ability.”

Many of the team members said it was difficult to get
prepared to swim and to motivate themselves.

“Sitting around all weekend wondering if we were
going to have a meet made it difficult to prepare,” senior

Rion Smith said.

Freshman Jay Rosenquest added “It was difficult for

Fish still run
the river wild

By JoHN Rog
Outdoors Columnist

Looking down from a high bluff, I could see where
the river used to run wild and free. I could picture where
every shallow, fast run would be, and I could see where a
small inlet would fill with water and flood the cypress
trees. I could imagine the patchwork of deep pools and
undercut banks that would hold many hungry trout and
bass, and I saw a small sandy flat near the canopy of
sycamores that would provide a perfect place to pitch a
tent. All of this was in my imagination because, much like
many rivers, this one was plugged by a hydro-powerplant.

The age of water generated power took off in the mid
1900s, and unfortunately, the environment was the big
loser. Not many thought of the environmental conse-
quences at the time, but when biologists reported a mas-
sive drop in the spawning of the Pacific Salmon, some
eyes were opened. Not only were the dams an eyesore, but
they had altered the river ecosystems in a drastic and
sometimes deadly way. The salmon spawning runs may
never be the same, but we can still salvage some recre-
ational value from these waters.

Fishing behind these dams still provides many qual-
ity opportunities for every type of fisherman. In times of
low water generation, flyfishers and spinfishers alike can
probe the deep pools and shallow runs by wading or by
canoe. -At low water, the rivers are much like they used to
be, and the fish will hold in the obvious places. Look for
trout in shallow, rocky runs and in the front of pools. Cast
for walleye, smallmouth or Kentucky bass behind boul-
ders in fast current, but try drifting a crawdad or
nightcrawler through the deeper pools. Pay close atten-
tion to undercut banks in these areas, for if you can cast
your fly or lure above the undercut and let it swing

Wrestlers still
fighting despite losses

Despite the bandages
and black eyes, the wres-
tling team continues to per-
form very well as individu-
als, but the team is still try-
ing to find a winning combi-
nation.

Wrestling

“We are the battling
walking wounded,” said
coach Tom Oddo of the
Davidson wrestling team
after last weekend’s compe-
tition at the Lancer Duals.
“We went into all of our
matches beat up and banged
up, but that didn’t keep us
from fighting hard.”

In last weekend’s tour-
nament, Davidson went.0 -
4, losing to PSU (18 - 26),
Norfolk State (19 - 28), Vir-
ginia Tech (9 - 36) and
Gardner Webb (9 - 37).

“We continue to give
up too many points by for-
feit, so we are fighting an
uphill battle the whole
match,” said coach Oddo.

the gap might not be shut.
“Those that are wrestling are

said coach Oddo. “But until
