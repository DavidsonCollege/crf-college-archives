Housing
remain adamantly opposed to
constructing new dorms. They
insist the situation is under
control, that temporary units
are not counterproductive, and
that the anticipated enrollment
decline will remove the problem
once and for all.

On the other side, however, is
the curious and puzzling statis-
tic of the rising percentage of
students coming back to live
in the dorms, instead of seeking
off-campus housing.

“There are less rules about
alcohol and bringing women to
your room. Many rules are now
options. Many left because they
wanted to do things in their
apartments that they couldn’t
do in the dorms, but that’s:no
longer true,” said Fredricksen.

“That is certainly a factor
housing officials had better look
at instead of just the enrollment
predictions,’’ cedes Dale Mea-
dor, director of residential facil-
ities at Western Illinois Univer-
sity.

Davidson’s field hockey team
scored their sixth victory aver
High Point yesterday with a
score of 2-1.

Less than three minutes into
the game, Cathy Inabnet car-
ried the ball downfield shooting
for the left outside but was
blocked by High Points goalie.
Their clear was redirected by
Beth Davidson as the Cats were

_on the offensive again.

Davidson was in command
80% of the time with hard
drives and leading passes but
could not seem to get the hall
in. Sally Craig had a beautiful
stop off a defensive drive and
passed to Inabnet, but still no
goal.

Two minutes 40 seconds later
High Point’s wing broke wide
and to the left. Cathy Morrel in
a one on one situation drove her
to the right but could not stop
the shot.

As High Point gained posses-
sion after the bully, Davidson’s
defense was ready. Katie
Dagenhart intercepted and the
Cats were again on the offen-
sive. Not for long, however,
because High Point again broke
loose. This time Beth Davidson
had doubled back and was in
position to force the ball wide,
preventing a potential goal.

With 20 seconds left in the
half the Cats decided to even
the score. Inabnet dodged three
close defensemen for a beautiful
shot placed in the left hand
corner.

The score was tied at the half
but the Cats went back out
determined to seal the victory.
It took 28 minutes with David-
son on the offensive most of the
time to do it. With 6 minutes
left to go the Cats executed the
picture play. |

Carol Heppner broke loose at
midfield and passed wide to
Courtney Hall who proceeded to
not only dodge her opponent
but jump over her and carry the
ball to the circle and pass to
Inabnet. Cathy’s shot was so
well placed that the goalie was
on the ground and the specta-
tors were on their feet cheering.

Men’‘s CC

_ dedicated souls permeated the

Davidson backwoods Saturday
morning in the 10 kilometer
European Cross Country Cham-
pionships. Incorporated into
the open division was a David-
son-UNCC men’s dual meet,
won by the Wildcats 18-45.

John Davis (34:00) and Jeff
Morrow (35:13) finished 1-2 for
the squad, nudging UNCC’s
Mark Price (35:28). The next
seven collegiate places were
taken by Davidsonians Randy
McManus, Terry Morrow, John
Rees, Danny Armistead, David
Barnes, Dave Stosur, and Tim
Ritchie, in that order.

Also braving the course,
complete with wooden barriers
and water obstacles, were the
Women ’Cats, competing only
among themselves. Victorious
Marian Hill and second place
Carrie Nunn were followed
closely on the 5 kilometer path
by teammates Melissa Peacock
and Merris Hollingsworth.

Both the men’s and women’s
end at the State Cross Country
Championships to be held in
Raleigh. The men, now 7-4,
will face a tough assortment of
15 or 16 schools, including
favorites North Carolina, Pem-
broke, Appalachian State, and
Duke. Only the top seven
Wildcat runners will compete in
the championships. The wo-
men’s division, with favored
North Carolina State, will be
run at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday,
with the men to follow at 11:00.
Runners not in the top seven
will compete in an earlier open
meet.
