Friday, November 17, 1989 THE DAVIDSONIAN

LANDLORD, from page 1

tee,” said Wood, “found that Burton did
notfitthecriteria.” He doesn’t haveany
children and habitat homes are usually
built for families. Yet Wood also said
that Habitat offered to negotiate with
the college to see what could be done
about Burton’s housing situation. The
college is not officially involved with
Habitat.

Both Wood and Craig expressed frus-
tration over the fact that Burton’s home
had been condemned. “We don’t mind
the college coming to us saying that
they know of a person who is desperate
for housing,” said Wood.

The problem was the fact that the col-
lege had allowed the house to reach a
state of total dilapidation. “They don’t
choose to use their finances to keep the
housing up,” said Craig. She specu-
lated that the college might not have put
the money into the house originally be-
cause it wanted to get out of lowincome
housing.

The decision was finally made to
renovate the house to meet building
standards. “Kicking Herman out was
unacceptable,” said Hoke. “The whole
thing rested on what he wanted to do.”

Hoke said that the cost of repair was
estimated at $30,000. “It should be
somewhat cheaper than the estimated,
since we’re doing the work ourselves,”
said Hoke. Director of Facilities Plan-
ning Grover Meetze refused to com-
ment on the situation.

Asked about how much it will cost the

college to renovate the house, Mainte-
nance Supervisor Allan Thompson
said, “we just went to work and are still
buying materials, so I don’t know how
much it will cost.”

The college does not have a definite
policy which details its role as a land-
lord, as Wood pointed out to the trus-
tees in a speech a year ago. He spoke
about the first family accepted by
Davidson's Habitat program, former
Eden street tenants:

“Brenda lives with two of her chil-
dren and four others in a two bedroom
house. Brenda has had a stable work
record at the college on the housekeep-
ing staff for over 13 years. Last year
during one month in the winter, her gas
bill was $172. Brenda rents her home
from Davidson College . You may want
to look into that.”

The trustees have started investigat-
ing Davidson’s housing policy. In the
1989 Financial Report the market value
of Davidson’s faculty and staff housing
investments was $3,744,309. By gifts or
purchase, Davidson owns property on
Concord and Lorimer roads. President
Kuykendall said that a task force has
been appointed to study the entire
question of Davidson’s role in provid-
ing housing for staff and faculty.

“We're not intentionally in low in-
come housing,” said Kuykendall. “It’s
pure happenstance since those lots
were acquired through a gift. We don’t
need to be involved.” Kuykendall also
mentioned, however, that the college

treasures the idea of a residential col-

lege community.

East Germany tears
down the wall

By CAROL GATEWOOD
BERLIN: Last week East Germany
opened up its borders to West Ger-
many, allowing its citizens free pas-
sage to the West without any restric-
tions.

Germans gathered along the Berlin
Wall and engaged in a massive cele-
bration as they scaled one of the last
symbols of the old Iron Curtain.

Many East Germans spent the
weekend shopping and enjoying
Western luxuries to which they are
unaccustomed; their government
even opened up more passages
along the wall to accommodate the
traffic of citizens.

Egon Krenz, the new Communist
Party leader in East Germany, stands
behind this open action in the hope
that free movement to the West will
encourage East Germans to merely
visit and not emigrate.

Before the country lifted its bor-
ders last week, more than 200,000
East Germans had left permanently.

. The Communist Party in East Ger-

many also announced that it will
totally| restructure its Council of
Ministers and that a Party Congress
will be held in December to rewrite
political goals.

ELSALVADOR: On Sunday rebels
in El Salvador launched a new offen-
sive against the U.S.-backed govern-
ment in the capital city of San Salva-
dor and other points throughout the
country.

' Several -hundred people were
missing or injured, and the New York
Times reported on Monday that at

eo

least 78 had been killed.

San Salvador was placed under a
curfew. Therebels’ attack came after
talks between the right-wing gov-
ernment, and the FMLN brokedown
due to the Oct.31 bombing ofa leftist
labor confederation.

A rebel commander admitted that
the offensive was partly an act of re-
taliation, and stated: “This govern-
ment has shown it wants to escalate
the dirty war.and we will meet them
head on.”

Though the rebels lack military su-
periority through firepower and
other supplies, as reported by the
New York Times, they are considered «
to be one of the best mobilized ar-
mies in Latin America.

CHINA: Deng Xaioping, the 85-year
old leader of Communist China re-
signed from his last official post in
the government. He stepped down.
from his chairmanship of the mili-
tary body of the Communist party,
and Jiang Zemin was named as his
successor.

Deng’sresignation came as sooner
than Western analysts had expected,
but it was probably done in aneffort
to ensure a stablesuccession. Jiang
wasrelatively unknown until he was
selected to head the Communist
party five months ago.

It is expected that if Deng dies
before more. appointments are

made, Jiang will not fare well in the.
transfer of power; Jiang lacks mili-
tary experience and does not have
internal allies to help himina pone

struggle.
