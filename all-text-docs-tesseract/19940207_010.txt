Flip Side
Junkies: a
bit of rock,
pop, folk...

By Tom Bavis

No Cowboy Junkies album has
captured as much attention as The
Trinity Session, their major label
debut from 1988. That album ap-
peared amidst a late-1980s burst of
brilliant folk-rockers like the In-
digo Girls, Suzanne Vega, and
Tracy Chapman. Like those acts,
the Canadian Cowboy Junkies --
consisting of siblings Michael,
Peter, and Margo Timmins, and
Alan Anton -- have persisted in
making great music. Every one of
the albums since The Trinity Ses-
sion has satisfied but failed to cap-
ture the spotlight.

The third of these unnoticed
lessons in persistence, and their
fifth album overall, is entitledPale
Sun Crescent Moon. The group,
led by guitarist, producer, and main
songwriter Michael Timmins, con-
tinues to drift away from The Trin-
itySession’s hushed, ethereal coun-
try in favor of grinding blues
grooves. As always, though, their
sonic melting pot overflows witha
bit of everything: country, rock,
blues, pop, and folk. The result
defies easy classification.

“Crescent Moon” is an un-
likely introduction, its groove
crawling along at a numbing pace.
The guitars that open the song are
simultaneously distorted and
muted, gritty yet restrained. They
soon fade into the back as Margo
Timmins’ angelic voice interprets
the words of her songwriting
brother: “I know I’m not part of the
life you had planned / But I think
once your body feels my hand /
Your mind will change and your
heart will lose its pain.”

“Ring on the Sill,” the album’s
third track, proves that the band
still soars over others at making
the touching and simple ballad.
Over a gentle, rolling rhythm with
bass, drums, guitar and organ floats
Margo Timmins’ voice. Ponder-
ing a dedicated but strained mar-
riage, she sings, “They’re thinking
of the long road ahead / And the
strength they will need just to get
to the end.” Margo’s voice has
always been shaky and expectant
in a similar style to 10,000 Mani-
acs’ Natalie Merchant. But unlike
Natalie, Margo milks an amazing
number of nuances out of a voice
that develops continuously. Her
throat is the perfect instrument to
take the lead over her brother
Michael’s songs.

As asongwriter and producer,
Michaelhasalsocontinued to grow.
The lyrics have achieved an al-
most Falkneresque sophistication.
The sound of Pale Sun Crescent
Moonisaddictively consistent. As
a cohesive and beautiful whole,
the album gives me hope for the
Cowboy Junkies; not hope that they
will finally capture the fame they
deserve, but that they will keep
scooping great songs out of their
- musical melting pot...

Artist Collie explores mental aftermath of Vietnam

By Jonathan Brooks
On Tuesday evening, ‘Kate

-Coltie enlightened Davidson stu-~

dents and staff in her talk “Viet-
nam: Notes and Echoes,” as she
explored the nightmarish effects
of American veterans’ experiences
in Vietnam.

Collie, whose paintings are
currently on display in the Visual
Arts Center, provided insight into
her series entitled Soldier’s Heart
and related her experiences with
the subject of that show, Steve
Piscitelli. Soldier’s Heart relates
the experiences of veteran Steve
-Piscitelli from his enlistment dur-
ing the Vietnam conflict to his
recovery twenty years after the war.

The composition of eight panels of

text and seven panels of paintings _

deals with the such psychological
problems as sleeplessness, fits of
rage, depression, and flashbacks
which have destroyed Piscitelli’s
life.

The viewer inevitably asks
why Kate Collie has chosen to
paint passionately about Vietnam
and post-traumatic stress disorder
when she herself was not active in
the conflict. According to Collie,
she was inspired by a personal
need to understand the long-last-
ing effects of war which have
caused many veterans to commit
suicide. In fact, her research has
found that of the men who saw

combat in Vietnam, the number of
veterans who have committed sui-
cide is greater than the number of
soldiers who died in warfare. Col-
lie expressed that she “became in-
terested in the psychological after-
effects of warfare on warriors by
getting to know some men who
fought in Vietnam” and began her
paintings long before the release
of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket,
two films which signified the be-
ginning of a trend in the arts to
convey the experiences of veter-
ans. Additionally, Collie began
her exploration before the govern-
ment had officially recognized
post-traumatic stress disorder and
other psychological after-effects “

first had Soldier’s Heartdisplayed
at a Spirit Square show. Collie
related a story to the audience con-
cerning a Vietnam veteran who
observed her work. The man ap-
proached her with tear-filled eyes
and simply said, “Thank you for —
trying to understand.” Collie ex-
pressed that she has felt rewarded
not only by the responses of veter-
ansbutalsoby the curiosity, aware-
ness, and enthusiasm that she has
evoked in non-veterans. Dr. Herb
Jackson commented that Collie’s
paintings “take the universal and

Exhibit: a
medium for
art and a
tool for
communication

By Josh Larned
Ernst August Quensen with-
out a doubt conceived the idea for
the Big Print—a stunning exhibi-
tion now on display in the Will-
iam Van Every Gallery of the Vi-

view that regards art as a medium
for thought as well as a tool for
mass communication in the mod-
ern age. According to critic
Leonard Lehrer, “Quensen be-
lieves there is no future without
art, that art is not a luxury, but a
necessity, that art is an integral
part vital to our existence.”

With his experience in the
tradition of lithography and his
knack for visual arts production,
Quensen set out to employ a vast
array of artists into his workshop
in Lamspringe, Germany. The
result is the exhibit you now see at
the VAC.

“Big” is truly the operative
word here, as most of the works
reach a maximum size of 100 x
140 cm. There appears to be no
common message uniting the
lithographs themselves, save their
inescapable ability both to startle

Modernism dismantled 1 in Quensen 'S ie Print

and titillate the viewer on a grandi-
ose scale. :
Davidson Professor Shaw
Smith in his essay entitled “Going
Big: Scale as Hype, Heroicism,
and Historicism,” asserts that
Quensen’s vision is the result of a
continuing evolution in print-mak-
ing juxtaposed with the “Heroic
Tradition.” Moreover, not only
does The Big Print draw upon
modernist trends developed by Jas-
per- Johns, Helen Frankenthaler,
Vito Acconci, and even former
Davidson visiting professor Andy
Owen, but it also has roots dating

back to past masters such as Jacopo
de’ Barbari, Albrecht Diirer, and
Titian. In Smith’s opinion, these
influences collide in this display to
forge bolder artistic styles: “The
big picture of this exhibition re-
minds us that if we look behind the
dazzling curtains of the eighties,
the ruins of modernism continue to
be dismantled and replaced, stone
by gigantic stone.”

Standouts in this exhibit in-
clude W.P. Eberhard Eggers’s
“Divina Proportione” (1989)—a
profile composed of facial traits
taken from an array of ethnic

groups, Frank Schult’s “Der
Siindenfall” (loosely translated
“The Fall of Man”) (1990)—a
nightmarish rendition of Eve’s
confrontation with Satan in the
Garden of Eden, and Gerd
Winner’s “Times Square II”—:

layering effect of different colors,
textures, and shapes that aptly por-
trays the neon urban euphoria that
is constant in a post-modern me-
tropolis.

The Big Printtruly is an over-
whelming feast for the senses. It
will remain on display until Feb-
Tuary 28.

Attenborough's Shadowlands delights and instructs

By Matt Smith

Potential viewers should be
warned: be prepared to watch a
great deal of Shadowlands with
misty eyes.

Again, Richard Attenborough
has directed a beautiful, emotional,
and at times heart-rending film that
must be ranked among the most
inspired of the past year. Even
among such powerhouse produc-
tions as The Piano, Philadelphia,
and Schindler’s List, and
Shadowlands undoubtedly holds
its own.

The plot of this film, which
tells the true story of author and
Oxford professor C. S. Lewis’

‘marriage ‘to.. American poet Joy’

Grisham, holds no surprises for the
viewer. In fact, it’s fairly simple:
Lewis (played by Anthony
Hopkins) befriends Grisham
(Deborah Winger) as she runs with
her son from an abusive and alco-
holic husband; Lewis marries
Grisham so she may legally re-
main in England; Grisham is diag-
nosed with cancer; Lewis falls in
love with Grisham. The true power
of the film, its primary concern, is
the transformation Lewis under-
goes as his secure, self-assured
world suddenly is shaken down to
its foundations by these occur-
rences.

The beginning of the film
shows ‘Lewis instructing students. .

in literature, explaining his phi-
losophy on suffering, and rational-
izing his Christian beliefs. His
world is structured, logical, and
very safe, very risk-free. He seems
to know all the answers, and he
hides himself behind his knowl-
edge. Even in the initial stages of
his relationship with Grisham, he
manages to remain at arm’s length
from her, never taking the chance
to express the feelings for her which
are. growing within him. Sadly
enough, it takes the prospect of her

- imminent death to scare him out of

his shell.-
That is the real action of

SL. Lewis’ ee :

Hopkins gives his finest perfor-
mance to date as he sheds his cold
and calculating Hannibal Lecter
mask and learns to allow himself
tolove. He uses everything froma
pleasingly original script to subtle
facial expression and bodily move-
ment to convey the dynamics of a
man coming to terms with himself,
his life, and the necessity for his
own self-transformation. When
he clenches his jaw and fist, you
feel his frustration; when he looks
about nervously, you feel his dis-
comfort; when he weeps, so do
you.
