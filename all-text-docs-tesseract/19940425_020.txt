summer's World Cup.

THOMAS DOOLEY
Defender/Midfielder
co-captain

What were your feelings when

you scored the first goal in America’s
2-0 victory over England?
Dooley: Scoring my first goal for the
United States was the greatest feeling
forme, and then afterthe game I thought
about just how important the game
was for the team. To beat England and
to be right there in the game was very
special.

What are your feelings about

playing on the American team after
playing in Europe solong and was the
transition?
Dooley: I grew up in Germany and I
never thought I would get the chance
to play for the United States. It was
lucky that a lady from the soccer part-
ners came to Germany, watched our
game, and someone introduced me,
inquiring my name. I saidI was Dooley,
and, since my name was not aGerman-
sounding name, she asked me if I was
interested in playing soccer for the
United States. Of course, I said I was
interested, and now I have this great
chance to play for this beautiful coun-
try this summer.

ALEXI LALAS
Defender

What were your first feelings

when you scored the clinching goal to
beat England in Foxboro?
Lalas: Basically, when I score, I usu-
ally don’t really know what the hell is
going on. I just sort of blacked out and
when I came back, the crowd was
going wild and people were passing
me and hugging me. It was a really
important goal and a great moment in
my life and a great goal for the U.S. I
haven’t watched it many times lately,
but maybe some years later I’ pull it
out and show it tomy kids. I want to be
given the chance to score an even
bigger goal, and that, hopefully, will
come this summer.

How excited are you about play-
ing in your hometown for America’s
first game against Switzerland?
Lalas: I was really excited when I
found out the U.S. got a game in De-

troit. To find out you get to return ©

home and play just ten minutes from
where you grew up playing, itis a very
surreal and emotional thought. I don’t
know yet what will happen, but I know
[the game] will be a very special mo-
ment.

How do you compare playing for

the Olympic team to having the possi-
bility of playing on the World Cup
team?
Lalas: For me, people are really im-
pressed when you say you played on
the Olympicteam, butin reality Iwould
trade every Olympic thing I ever did to
play on the World Cup team. It is that
much more important. The difference
in style and the level of competition is
dramatic. I had a good time and expe-
rience playing for the Olympic team,
but the World Cup is where it’s at.

TONY MEOLA

Goalkeeper
co-captain

Can you tell me how you first felt
when you took the fieldin Italy against
Czechoslovakia in 1990?

Meola: Well, you finally realize you
represent millions and millions of kids
in America, soccer players in America
and know you are a part of a World
Cup. You also realize there’s not much
mental preparation you can do be-
cause when you get to [the World Cup]
it is a totally different situation than
what you thought it would be. It was
exciting for me, and Ill never forget it.

How do you think the first expe-
rience.will help this time around, es-
pecially being one of the few players
returning from that squad?
Meola: The biggest problem in 1990
was that we didn’t have any experi-
ence. We can’t complain about that
this time. We have a staff that has been
through it, players that have been
through it, an organization that has
been through it, a coach that has been
through it, and we didn’t have any of
that in 1990. Now, we really don’t
have to worry about those things.

What would you consider your
greatest moment as a soccer player?
Meola: Probably the November of 1989
game when we qualified for the World
Cup by defeating Trinidad & Tobago
and then three weeks later, I came back
and was able to be a part of a National
Championship with the University of
Virginia. To be able to juggle the two

| > was probably the most difficult thing I
have ever done.

COBI JONES
Midfielder

How does it feel to have gone
from being anon-scholarship college
player to playing second in minutes
for the U.S. National team?

Jones; It has been a pleasant surprise.

By Will Cobb
No other sporting event in
the world evokes more national
pride than the World Cup. This
summer, America will be taken
by storm from June 17 through
July 17. The World Cup is the
largest single sporting event in

the world, featuring a 52 game
tournament that will end at the
Rose Bowl on July 17.

The 1990 final in Italy drew

a television audience of over one
billion people. This summer’s fi-
nal expects a viewing audience of
over twice that figure. In 1990, the
United States ended a 40-year
drought when we defeated Trinidad
& Tobago 1-0 to qualify for the
World Cup. The expression on ev-

ery player’s face was that of relief.
That 1990 squad was inexperienced
and fortunate just to participate.
The 1994 team has a different plan.

‘soccer to the next level.

With the awaited return of the
players still competing profes-
sionally in Europe, the U.S. na-
tional team is ready to raise U.S.

This summer __ holds
America’s best chance to reach
the second round of the World
Cup in almost 50 years. With the
current level of talent and coach-
ing, the long awaited dream may
come true: On June 18, the quest
will begin when the U. S. faces
Switzerland in the Silverdome.
The first ever indoor match in
World Cup history will hopefully
be remembered as America’s first
step back into soccer prominence.
Now is the time to prove how far
soccer in the U.S. has come.

Year after year, my gamehas increased,
and I have gotten more and more rec-
ognition. I am very happy with it and
owe it all to Mike Lapper.

How long did it take you to ad-
just to the international style of play?
Jones: I would say it took a month or
so. It is just a matter of building
confidence and getting used to playing
against some of the top players in the
world every time you play. I have
gotten the chance to get some minutes
and play against those teams that are
pretty decent.

STEVE SAMPSON
Assistant Coach

What will be the most important
part of the team’s game to advance to
the second round of the World Cup?
Sampson: I think if we stay within the
organization Bora has structured for
us. Defensively, we must play very
well, and I think we have to be able to
counter-attack and take advantage of
the opportunities that we have on goal,
because in the World Cup you don’t
get that many opportunities. We have
tobe very well organized and effective
on free kick situations andcornerkicks.
Team organization is the most impor-
tant part, because if we fall out of that,
then a lot of gaps can be created, and
opponents in the World Cup will take
advantage of those opportunities.

Whatare your feelings about the
team’s progress thus far with roughly
two months before the World Cup
begins? « i
Sampson: We’re making individual
progress much faster than we are as a
team. I think the team has plateaued

right now, and the reason I say this is
because a lot of people are anxious
about being selected for the final 22.
But I think certain individuals have
made tremendous progress, like
Claudio Reyna and Tony Meola, who
in the last two to three months has
really focused in on his game. He is
playing very well, and I think he will
peak at the right time for the World
Cup. As a team, it will be able to make
the next step when the European play-
ers are here and the cuts are made.

CLAUDIO REYNA
Midfielder

How much different is it return-

ing to Davidson as a member of the
U.S. national team as opposed to be-
ing a collegiate player?
Reyna: It is extremely different be-
cause this is a different level of compe-
tition and pressure, especially since I
am competing for a spot on the World
Cup team.

Your coaches have praised your
progress. Do you feel your game has
improved since joining the team in
January?

Reyna: At my first game against Nor-
way, I was really nervous. But as the
matches and practices have progressed,
I have become much more confident
and comfortable with my game. I think
my game has also improved because I
feel more relaxed on the field when I

play.

MARCELO BALBOA
Defender

What work habits are required
to play at this level?
Balboa: Training with the team is great,
but you need extra training. On club
teams you may practice Tuesdays and
Thursdays, but to get to this level you
have to practice on your own on the
other days. It takes a lot of dedication
and a lot of hard work, but it is not
impossible to get here. It just depends
on how hard you work and where your
goals are set.

A year ago you suffered a knee
injury, but you came back in Decem-
ber and have scored three goals since
then. How does that make you feel?
Balboa: I was just happy to return so
early from my injury and be able to
play again. Everything else that has
happened then, like scoring the goals,
I’ve just been in the right place at the
right time. Going forward and scoring
goals is one of my strengths. If I can
score more goals to help the team, then
that is what I am going to do.

You were in Italy in 1990; how
do you think having that first experi-

‘ence will help you this summer?

Balboa: I think when we went into ’90,
we were a team that was really happy
to be in the World Cup. We weren’t
expected to do much, but now we are
much more experienced and know what
the World Cup is all about. Now we
want to go out and prove to the world
America can make it to the second
round .
