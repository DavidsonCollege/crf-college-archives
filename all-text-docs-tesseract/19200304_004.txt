There must be something mystical about five Sundays in February
coming once in forty-eight years, for we had snow instead of rain for

Junior Speaking.
M sion of the Treasury Department, last week delivered a lecture
on the “Dollar Education” in which he outlined and discussed
what he considered one of the biggest problems before America today.
Out of the experiences of the war has come the realization that financial
roblems are to become an increasingly important factor in American
life The need for educating the future business men in the economic
problems and in the principles of working and saving has become in-
delibly impressed on the financial leaders of our nation. ;

Various means have been used in other countries for the promotion
of thrift. In this country it has been propagated through the wide-
spread advertisements of the treasury department. Now it is proposed
that courses be carried on at all institutions, either compulsory or elect-
ive, for the study of economics withemphasis on the necessity of cultiv
ating the habit of saving. . ;

It happens very opportunely that some of the donations which were
received in the recent campaign were specified to be devoted to the es-
tablishment of a chair of Economics. This department is expected to fill
a long felt need in the curriculum. Of course it is not definitely known
what the course will include nor how extensive it will be, but such
courses as are urged by the treasury department will naturally be in-
cluded. oo,

Davidson is not a college which is expected to prepare a man
for a special business or profession but the vocations which the grad-
uating classes pursue vary widely from those of former days. It is sur-
prising to consider the number of the class of '19 who are now in the
cotton mill or some other form of business. _In any profession even the
knowledge of economic principles and conditions should prove an in-
valuable asset. This privilege therefore should be cherished and appre-
ciated by the classes which are to follow.

CO-OPERATION.

DOLLAR EDUCATION. :

R. WILLIAM MATHER LEWIS, Director of the savings divi-

murings have been made against the faculty on some of their rul-
ings. Before making such protests we should first take into consid-
eration what the results may be. It can be said with little fear of stc-
cessful contradiction that kicking helps very little the cause for which
the complaints are made. The byproducts of such a spirit are the far-

reaching and the dangerous results, ; -
At this time when Davidson is in the midst of a transition, absolute

[: the past few months many public criticisms and more private mur-

harmony and co-operation between the faculty and students is essential |

to success. Our adherents are nobly responding to our demands in the
campaign for money. They are expecting on the other hand a just re-
turn from their investments. For their hopes to be fully realized every
member of the faculty and student body must work wholeheartedly for
the building up of the college. .

Wherever Davidson representatives have gone they have added to
her reputation of having an unexampled spirit of co-operation and love
for their Alma Mater. This is a reputation to be highly honored and
cherished by any college and certainly one that no loyal Davidson man
wants to see destroyed. . ; .

The faculty may be wrong in some of their decisions, but why con-
tinue to complain and whine over’su h items as credit for military work?
Do all that can be done and if unsuccessful take it like a man and forget
it. It is a student’s privilege to stand up for his rights and no one
would desire to deprive him of it, but constant complaining which often
takes the form of unclassified but familiar words is not conducive to his
own realization of the future Greater Davidson.

MOVIES DELIGHT LARGE
AUDIENCE FRIDAY NIGHT

appeared in a fight, until the very
end, when he jumped from the burn-

It is-rumored that the occasional
representatives of the fair sex kept
a large ntmber of the fellows from
seeing the picture last week. Nev-
ertheless it was a very good one.
“The Parson of Panamint” was
shown and William Farnum acted
his role of “the parson” in the most
excellent manner. He held the au-

ing church steeple. Although the
end was a little pathetic, the movie
was full of pep and action and was
much enjoyed by those present.

The band entertained the audi-
ence during the changing of reels
with several selections. This music
is one of the best features of the
weekly movie shows and everyone
appreciates it.

Most Mighty Sanhedrin:

Despite the many warnings of
your executive to the fellows on the
hill to let there be light in our cor-
ridors and baths, the lights continue
to disappear. It can certainly be
said here that. Davidson men love
darkness rather than light—at least
there are a few who believe this.

Should these few petty light lifters

fellows grope around in the dark?

And, still, there are a lot of per-
will read it, and take it all in, and
fectly * well-meaning persons who
nod their heads in sweet accord, and
vow by their lives that a parable has
certainly been spoken and _ their
sentiments exprest toa “T.” I re-
fer to those anti-R. O. T. C. articles
that are beginning to get on the
nerves of a lot of us, just as it gets
on our nerves to have to listen to a
dog whining all day, or a baby cry-
ing all night. In either case most of
us would like mightily to heave a
brick at the offender.

What on earth do the gentlemen
hope? Do they never stop to think
that the R. O. T. Cis a part of the
armed protective force of the United
States? Do they never stop to think
that they are howling and kicking
against one of the safe-guards ofour
Nation? Can’t they see how ridi-
culous and despicable they make
themselves by their feeble little
convulsions over an institution that
they apparently have no nower to
comprehend in its broad scope?
Don’t they realize that the R. O. T.
C. is vastly more than a mere col-
lege activity, and that their com-
plaints are unpatriotic? “It should
he kicked out,” they cry, in effect.
Do they think so highly of their
wisdom and insight that they can
prescribe what is best for them-
selves, the college, and the Nation?
Hadn't they better, instead, guard
themselves, lest they be kicked from
the R. O. T. C. and disregarded? If
they let words govern their actions,
and if their words continue in the
present tone, they might as well be

icked out, for all the good they can
ever be to the organization.

“We voted it in, and we can vote
it out,” they say. Then why don’t
they vote it, out, and say nothing
more about it? Better to do that,
than to keep it here, and continue
to be a disgrace to the organization,
the uniform and the Flag. But by
so doing, are they going to make
confession of the fact that they are
so lazy of body, so stunted of mind,
and so void of desire to become use-
ful citizens, capable of bearing arms
for their country’s defense that
they are unwilling to give of their
time and energy to serve the land
their forefathers and their very bro-
thers have given their lives for? But
why not stiffen up the backbone a
little, and determine that, if the
Government thinks there ought to
be an R. O. T. C. unit here, we will
see that it is the best unit that we
can possibly make it? Most of us
did not serve in the recent war, from
one cause and another. Isn’t it
about the least we can do to take
advantage of every opportunity to
prepare ourselves for military ser-
vice, and determine with a great
determination, that, if at some fu-
ture day we shall hear the call of
duty, we will not be found lacking?
Duty calls now: it calls to prepara-

E’en the flowers seems to love you—
And smile as you pass by;
The birds sing with a melody
Unheard till you are nigh;
The trees all bend their leafy

And bow in courtly grace;
The sun more brightly sends its rays
To shine upon your face.
I'm glad when all these worship you

For none can love and cherish you

BUY A PIPE.

God made him a creature of infinite
wit,
As cautious and canny as sin;
He gave her the powers of him in
the pit
To deceive and beguile us poor
men,

When Adam was lonely and be-
moaned his hard lot,
Sweet Eve sprang out from his
ribs
Suggested to do those things he
should not, .
And enslaved the wise scamp with
her fibs.

By a chasm of time, we are lost from
that day;
New customs we find, and new
styles.
But the daughters of Eve, in an up-
to-date way
Continue to practice their wiles.

A flash of bright eyes, soft gurgles
of glee,
Play their part in setting the
snare ;
Beware, my son, of the ladies you

see,
Blue eyed, with pale blond hair.

The devil made dimples to wreck
man’s career,
That implacable foe of man
Becomes of good cheer, and draws
quite near
When you gaze at her “lily white
hand.”

Be strong, my son; success shall be
thine;
Stop holding the bag for snipe ;
Don’t whine like a pup at a “fair
one’s” shrine,

For solace, go buy you a pipe.
Ex.
