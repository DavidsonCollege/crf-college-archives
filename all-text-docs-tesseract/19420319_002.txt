Why Not Have Dances Here?

* The Pan-Hellenic Council: might well
be congratulated on the last set of dances
sponsored by Seabbard and Blade and
the “-D” Club, as it-was truly-one-of the
finer sets.

ffowever, it was rather disheartening
to note how few. persons attended due
to lack of transportation and various
other reasons. It looks to us like the
time has come to make it a necessity for
the students to ask for dances on the
campus. “Impossible,” say some, “and
weve thought out all the angles.”

But there must be some angles that
haven't been thought out.

The fact of the presence of Joe Barn-
weil’s band performing ‘between the
halves of the senior-varsity basketball
game the other night put ideas into

quite a few heads---ideas that consisted ©

of-the newer gym;-decoratedtothe raft=
ers, swelling with the tunes of a Pan-
Hellenic signed band here in Davidson.

But there are arguments against hav-
ing dances in Davidson. ‘There's no
place to have them!” scream those same
persons, “The gym’s too small and the
banquet hall is out of the question,”

We agree on the fact that the gmy
is too small for a regular dance set for
the whole school---but a Junior-Senior
dance is not out of the question---also,
it seems that fraternity’ dances might
be better attended with less expense per
person if they could possibly be held
in Davidson.

Tire shortage has tended to make last
minute rides almost impossible to secure
---you just can’task a date without hav-
ing a ride arranged for in advance---
and if this transportation element could
be eliminated, the expense would be
split down to the cost of the dance ticket
plus,a few incidentals. ;

But, there is still another problem to

-solve. We arn’t allowed to have dances
in Davidson. Everybody seems to real-
ize that they take place, yet the’ ban
