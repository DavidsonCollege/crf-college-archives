Still Whistlin' Dixie

Getting Drunk and country music, a tradition

By Geoff Graham

I met my Davidson “little sis-
ter” last week. She hails from the
great state of New Jersey. She’s
very sweet and, although I’ve
known her for a short time only,
she appears to be an exceedingly
fun person. Her accent is hardly
noticeable.

Before I continue, let me men-
tion that, aside from the past few

weeks, she hasn’t spent much time.

down South. With that said, let me
surprise you. She told me (I’m
dead serious) Country music isn’t
that big up North. That’s not all.

She’d never heard of Garth Brooks!
Idon’t mean she’d never heard his

music. When I mentioned the im- .

pending Garth Brooks concert in
Charlotte, she asked, “Is that a
local band?” I laughed. “Good
joke,” I said. She didn’t laugh.
Apparently Country really isn’t
popular up there.

I’ve been wondering about this
for a few days. Why isn’t it appre-
ciated? Why isn’t Country the
musicof choice for all self-respect-
ing Americans? — Without listing
all the possible reasons (I might
offend a great many of you ifI did),

Pll get down to it. I finally con-
cluded that Country just wasn’t
properly introduced North of the
Mason-Dixon line.

To make up for this unfortu-
nate discrepancy, I’ve compiled a
short list (in no order but that in
which they came to mind) for my
little sister and the possible hun-
dreds more like her attending the
great institution of Davidson Col-
lege. These aren’t particularly the
best songs, but perhaps the best
representative. They will give the
listener a sense of what Country is

all about. Here is your heartache, —

here is your joy, here is your wis-
dom.

Clint Black’s “Killin’ Time”
definitely has some key ingredi-
ents ofa true Country song: Gettin’
drunk and missing someone who’s
left you. The latter is certainly the
most frequent theme in Country,
but frequency by no means signi-
fies importance. The former is
every bit as notable. In fact, the
two generally go hand in hand. To
quote Doug Stone: “If you’re
drinkin’, you’llstart thinkin’, ‘bout

Body
Piercing

More and more
students are
putting metal
into their bodies

By Rachel Newcomb

I can’t remember a time when
Ididn’twant my ears pierced, Prob-
ably the main reason I wanted them
pierced so badly was because I had
been forbidden by my parents to
get them pierced until I was eigh-
teen. At the age of eleven, I de-
cided I was tired of waiting. Un-
fortunately, Ihad no money and no
parental permission.to get my ears
pierced at the mall. So I decided to
do itmyself. Luckily someone had
left a pair of gold starter studs at
my house once before, andI’dkept
them for a couple years, thinking
someday I could possibly use them.
I numbed my ear with ice, stuck a
needle through, then pulled it out
quickly and put in the starter stud.
No problem. I waited until school
the next day to pierce the other one
in front of a crowd of admiring, or
probably aghast, sixth graders. I
didn’t even use ice this time. They
were all impressed.

Fora few days, I didn’t tellmy
mother. I had fairly short hair, but
I tried to keep it over my ears as
much as possible, and even went
through a charade of making ear-
rings out of construction paper and
telling my mother I was making
jewelry. The construction paper
was nice, and it covered my ears
pretty well, but I realized Icouldn’t
. wear paper earrings forever. So
one morning, I told her. Of course
I got in trouble; I couldn’t watch
my favorite T.V. show “What’s
Happening” for a month and I had
to wash the family cars. But I got
tokeep them. “If you wanted your
ears pierced that badly that you
would do it yourself, then I guess
you can keep them,” my mother
sighed grudgingly.

This was all a very big deal to
an eleven year old. Compared to
the things people are getting pierced
nowadays, my personal experience
palesin comparison. But Iremem-
ber the rush I felt at having pierced

ears. I wanted more, soa few years
later, I double pierced one ear. I
even pierced the ears of some of
my male friends when that became
the rage in high school. This is by
no means an endorsement of the

African tribes. I spoke with Jen
Guise, a senior psychology major,
about body piercing in Nepal.
Guise participated in an experien-
tial study abroad program in which
she was encouraged to acclimate

that doing it yourself isn’t very
smart. If you’ re thinking of having
something pierced, visit a profes-
sional.

It was a few: years after my
own sixth grade experience that I
realized people often pierce parts
of the body other than the ears. In
the past few years, there hasbeena
greater acceptance of body pierc-
ing. A recent article in Creative
Loafing newspaper entitled “Body
Piercing Finds the Mainstream”
attests to this fact. However, body
piercing isstill the exception rather
thanthe rule. —

The concept of body piercing
is not new. According to the ar-
ticle in Creative Loafing, the Egyp-
tians pierced their navels as a sign
of royalty. Techniques such as lip
piercing are a tradition in some

dress, eating with my hands,” she
said. “At about the age of three or
four, practically every person gets
their nose pierced in Nepal. The
family I was living with encour-
agedit, andI just wanted to. By the
time we left, all the girls onthe trip
had gotten their noses pierced.”
She had never thought about hav-
ing it done before going abroad,
but felt like it would be a good
experience in participating in the
culture of Nepal.

I asked her about the proce-
dure that was followed in Nepal
for piercing the nose. “It was ina
jewelry shop; they used a gun. It’s
not like they took a spear or any-
thing and drove it through. It did
get alittle bit infected and swelled
alot. The mother I was living with
took a tiny branch from the garden,

and put it where the post had been.
The infection went away.” Wasit
painful? “No, it didn’t hurt that
badly. It looks painful, but it isn’t.
For me, earrings are more uncom-
fortable. They get caughton things,
whereas having your nose pierced
is very low maintenance.”

She mentioned that she didn’t
pierce her nose to make any sort of
statement. “It’s avery natural thing
in Nepal. It’s part of the culture. It
was something I just wanted to
do.” In the Creative Loafing ar-
ticle, a professional body piercer
from Charlotte mentioned that
body piercing is a ritual, some-
thing that makes people more spiri-
tually aware of their bodies. It is
possible to pierce almost any body
part, from tongues to nipples to
belly buttons, even to genitalia. At
Davidson, several students besides
Jen have pierced body parts other
than the ear. One student has a
nipple ring. Another sports a
pierced tongue. Both wish to re-
main anonymous. Thestudent with
the pierced tongue told me, “It
didn’t hurt that bad. I really don’t
even notice that it’s there.” Ac-
cording to Wendy Propst, the body
piercer in the Creative Loafing ar-
ticle, there are some special tech-
niques that must be followed, and

Movie Review

"Hard Target"
is "The
Real McCoy"

By Scott McLean

Asa special added bonus, this
week’s “critic’s corner” will fea-
ture a double billing: “The Real
McCoy” with Kim Basinger and
“Hard Target” starring Jean Claude
van Damme. Now y’all may be
asking yourselves, “Scott, what did
we do to deserve this royal treat-
ment— two movies in one week?”
Well folks, the pace was a little
slow in McLeanland this time
around so I was able to squeeze an
extra flick into my schedule. I
work tirelessly so I can give you
the latest word on as many current
films as possible in order to broaden
your entertainment horizons. You
know, I think that may be my prob-
lem— I give ‘til it hurts.

Anyway, first up is “The Real
McCoy” in which Kim Basinger
plays the title character Karen
McCoy, a bank robber out on pa-
roleand forced back into burglaring
in order to save her kidnapped son.
To begin with, you know
something’s up when Kim emerges
from prison after six years looking
like she was ready to do.a Vogue
cover. Not that I particularly
minded this, but it didn’t exactly
do wonders for the credibility of
the film. Child, ifthat’s what prison
will do for a woman then I can
think of several individuals that
need to be serving life.

However, that’s just the tip of
the iceberg as the movie goes from
bad to worse (and I’m talking re-
ally bad) and I think all that needs
to be said is that I can nap at home
for free, you know what I’m say-
ing? I feel for Kim here though,
because she is probably looking
for every bit of work she can get in
order to pay off the $9 million fine
she owes the producers of “Boxing
Helena” for breaching an oral
agreement to star in that film.
Maybe new hubby Alec Baldwin
can give her a loan so that we will
be spared this and any other future
stinkers she feels forced to do.

Moving right along, next is
the action/adventure thriller “Hard
Target” with Jean-Claude van
Damme as a down and out soldier
hired to investigate the deaths of
homeless victims. I had heard ex-
cellent things about this film and
I’m glad to say they were all true.
Acclaimed director John Woo pre-
sents the action as an art form
through slow motion photography
whichis really pretty nifty to watch.
And as if that weren’t enough, he
also makes the most interesting
use of a snake I have seen in the
movies since “Conan the Barbar-
ian.” Sufficed'to say that I thought
“Hard Target” was too Damme
bad (sorry, I couldn’t resist) - a
definite thumbs up.

That’s all for this week, folks,
but stay tuned ‘cause in subse-
quent weeks I'll be tackling some
pretty heavy pictures that you won’t
want to miss. ‘Til next time, so
long!
