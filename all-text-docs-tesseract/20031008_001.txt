SGA violates
its own bylaws
Procedure and timeline

not followed in recent
committee appointments

By Caro ine K. HAUSER
Managing Editor

After weeks of requests from school ad-
ministrators, the SGA has submitted a list of
student appointments to faculty and trustee
committees. The list, which the Davidsonian
obtained from President Bobby Vagt, does
not adhere to SGA bylaws.

While the committees are now complete
and moving ahead, some appointments were
made late and all appointments failed to
comply with prescribed SGA procedure.
Most notably, the general student body was
not invited to apply for the positions.

SGA leadership says that a lack of com-
munication with committees and one
student’s decision to go abroad derailed the
process. :

Committee appointments were supposed
to have been made last spring by a process
detailed in the most recently approved SGA
bylaws. According to Article 4, Section D, a
list of student positions to be filled should
have been published by the Chancellor—at
the time, Mabe Garcia—’05—and posted in
each dorm. Students would then be able to
sign up for available positions.

Within a week of signups, senate commit-
tees would have interviewed interested stu-
dents, then presented their nominations for
Senate approval. A majority vote of the
Senate is required for appointment.

This process was not followed.

ALL HAIL THE KING & QUEEN

Homecoming. 2003,

Njie and Ward win King and Queen; alums look back

By Rucut TURAKHIA

Amidst the excitement surrounding this
year’s Homecoming, the close football game
and the crowing of Homecoming King Mbye
Njie ’04 and Queen Courtney Ward ’04 , one
might have noticed a few older faces—the
faces of alumni who are back at Davidson for
their reunion, or simply returned to visit their
alma mater.

With 309 alumni in attendance for Home-
coming weekend, official reunions were held

for the fifth, 10th, 60th, and 65th, or those for the
classes of 1998, 1993, 1943, and 1938.
Thirty-one men attended the class of 1943’s
60th reunion Homecoming weekend.
According to Matthew Merrell, Director of
Alumni Relations, this is the largest 60th re-
union Davidson has seen. Among the class of
43 are names such as John Belk, the founder of
Davidson’s John Montgomery Belk Scholar-

‘ ship, and John McGee, who has given over a

million dollars to the Dean Rusk Program for
International Studies and from whom the

What does

17% mean?

CORE survey reveals
the other side of drug
and alcohol use

Pd

Most students have noticed the “17%”
signs prevalent throughout campus, now
present on posters, pens, and mugs.

The “17%” signifies that 17 percent of
Davidson students drink once a year or less,
a figure based on the 2002 Core Alcohol and
Drug Survey which many of us filled out
last year.

Along with the “17% fact,” the CORE
Survey results reveal several other surpris-
ing statistics about drug and alcohol use on
Davidson’s campus.

According to CORE data, seventy-seven
percent of all students and seventy-five
percent of underage students (younger than
twenty-one) reported that they have con-
sumed alcohol in the previous thirty days.

Forty-four percent of all students reported
binge drinking in the previous two weeks, -
where a binge is defined as consuming five
or more drinks in one sitting, and 14.7
percent of students describe themselves as
current marijuana users, “current” meaning
with at least a “30-day prevalence.”

Many Davidson students have also felt
the consequences of drug and alcohol use;
thirty-one percent of students reported some
form of public misconduct, such as trouble
with the police, fighting, receiving a DUI,
or vandalism, at least once during the past
year as a result of drinking or drugs. Like-
wise, over thirty-two percent of students
