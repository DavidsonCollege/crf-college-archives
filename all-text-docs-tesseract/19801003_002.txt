Wood explains placement policy

By DONALD CALDWELL

A recent issue of Esquire
devoted its cover story to a
question of great, if furtive,
concern to Davidson students:
“Who will make money in the
80s?”

To show that the baby boom
of the 1940’s and 1950's will
result in a glut of over-educated
job seekers in the mid-1980's,
Esquire printed the story of
*‘Harold’’, a hypothetical corp-
orate executive with immacu-
late credentials stuck in this
future squeeze. Frustrated by
the seeming impossibility of
scaling the corporate ladder

DAV,to face

When WFAE, UNC.-Char-
lotte’s radio station, starts
broadcasting next year, it will
not draw substantially from
WDAV's audience, according to
WFAE station manager Bo
Pittman.

WFAE, which is now off the
air, used to be a 10 watt station
broadcasting primarily classical
music.

In January, Pittman said,
WFAE will boost its power to
100,000 watts and begin broad-
casting music provided by Na-
tional Public Radio (NPR).

The NPR program covers a
wide variety of material from
which WFAE plans to choose
mostly jazz and some classical
music. In addition, WFAE will
broadcast local news and other
non-musical programs.

“We are looking to jazz for
our basic music format,’’ Pitt-
man said, ‘‘We don’t want to be
in direct competition with pub-
lic radio provided by Rock Hill
and WDAV.”

WDAV Station Manager Ed
McIntyre admitted that
WFAE’s programming could
hurt WDAV but said most of
the loss would be from the south
side of Charlotte where the
signal from WDAV is not
strong anyway.

‘When given the choice be-
tween two similar programs at
different signal strengths (the
listeners) are going to choose
the higher signal,’’ McIntyre
said. .

WDAV now broadcasts at

complete and mail back.

Hairston described a simpler
way. A blood relative can
obtain an absentee ballot from
the student’s home county elec-
tion board and mail it to the
student.

of their hometowns. However,

However sensational Har-
old's story may be, the article
does reflect an undercurrent of
desperation among many col-
lege seniors perparing to enter
the job market.

Graduate schools, once a
haven for 80 percent of David-
son's graduates, are now ap-
pearing far less attractive than
in the past. With the value of
graduate degrees falling due. to
the sheer numbers of people
having them, many seniors will
choose to enter the job market
directly.

Even the professions are no

18,500 watts, one-fifth the pow-
er of WFAE'’s future signal.
However, McIntyre said that
while WDAV’s wattage will
probably not increase, the sig-
nal will improve with the in-
stallment of a new transmission
tower.

The new tower will be 50 feet
higher, increasing the signal
range by about five miles. Also,
the tower will be closer to

Charlotte, where WDAV’s au-

dience is concentrated, McIn-
tyre said.

Construction of the tower
awaits FCC approval.

WDAV's current range is
about 20 miles. WF AE hopes to
have a 30 to 40 mile stereo range
and about a 60 mile mono
signal broadcast at 90.7 on the

FM dial.
WFAE was also one of the

reasons for a recent WDAV
late-night programming
change, according to McIntyre.

About a month ago WDAV
began playing a mixture of jazz,
classical, and rock after 10p.m.
Earlier, McIntyre said, the

‘station had switched at 10 from

all classical to jazz or rock.

Since WFAE will broadcast
“nothing but jazz,’’ McIntyre
said, this new programming will
differentiate between two -sta-
tions. “‘We don’t want to be
duplicating what they’re
doing.”’

McIntyre admitted that reac-
tion to the change has been
‘“mixed.”’

‘We're after the music lovers
— people willing to try different
kinds of music,’’ he said.

sonian poll show the following
about students’ political inclin-
ations:

—43% plan to vote for Rea-
gan; 22% for Anderson; 19%

for Carter; 2% for other candi-

dates; and 13% expressed no
preference.
—28. of those polled are

registered Republicans; 26‘

are Democrats; 6v are register-
ed with other parties; and 38‘

—42‘~. described themselves

tive; and 15% as liberal.

longer safe. A report submitted
this week to the Department of
Health and Human Services in
Washington predicted a surplus
of 70,000 doctors by 1990, a
surplus expected to double by
the end of the century.

Such figures have predictably
increased career anxieties on the
nation’s campuses. At David-
son they have increased interest
in present activities of the
Center for Experiential Pro-
grams and Life Work Planning,
which handles career study and
job placement.

“I’ve heard a lot of concern
from some upperclassmen that
not enough corporations are
coming to Davidson to inter-
view students,’’ SGA President
David Waddill said. ‘‘One guy
asked me why Reynold’s Tobac-
co doesn’t send anyone down
when the president of the
company is a Davidson grad-
uate."’

Junior Elliot Stottler, chair-
person of the SGA committee
on Internships, Job Placement
and Corporate Relations, noted
that ‘In not having recruiters
here, Davidson students are a
step behind students from other
schools. I don’t particularly

‘think we should push students

to recruiters but we do need
more of them to increase the
choices available.”

“Davidson has traditionally
had a good reputation with grad
schools but given the present
job situation we need to estab-
lish the same reputation with
corporations.”’

The SGA is now conducting a

survey of the senior class to

determine their placement
needs, Waddill said.

Ken Wood, Director of the
Center, responded that ‘‘Stud-
ents have to understand their
interests, values, and skills
before they look for a specific
job. Too often people look at
what’s available and then mold
themselves into it. This is
putting the cart before the
horse.”’ ;

Dean of Students Will Terry
agreed. ‘‘A senior has to know
himself and see his strengths
and weaknesses. The advantage
of this approach is not just to go
through placement but to learn
to sell yourself to companies,

- which is especially important if

you don’t find something right
away.”

Wood pointed out that too
many students begin. thinking
about careers too late. ‘‘Sopho-

more year is the best time to

begin thinking. At that point
there's plenty of time to explore
your interests through extern-
ships, internships, etc.”

“This identification of inter-
ests can’t be overemphasized.
Recruiters are interested in
students that have a sense of

themselves and can: demon-

strate that.”

Wood disputed the charge
that the Center has not devoted
enough attention in the past to
recruitment. ~

‘‘According to the Depart-
ment of Labor only 9°v of
college graduates find jobs
through placement offices. The
vast majority, 84° , find work
through contacts, friends, rela-
tives, and direct inquiries.”

There are two new faces at WDAV this year. Henry Doss took
over three months ago as director of community relations. He will
work to increase the station’s audibility.

Joining Doss on the WDAV staff is Jan Weller, the station’s new
production director: Weller is from Oxford, Ohio, where he worked
at public radio station WMUB-FM. In addition to being
program director, Weller will be WDAV’s weekday morning

Clarification

Last week The Davidsonian reported that the Board of Trustees
will meet with the Educational Policy Committee (EPC) to
“discuss possible curriculum changes and arrange a schedule
for future tenure decisions.”’

The meeting will actually serve only to inform the Trustees
of meeting times with tenure candidates during winter term,
according to Vice President for Academic Affairs Price
Zimmermann. —

In addition, Zimmermann said the EPC will present their
proposals for curriculum changes to the Trustees. The
Trustees will make no decision, however.

“The Trustees have delegated responsibility for educational
policy to the faculty,’’ Zimmermann said.

The EPC will present its proposals to the faculty sometime
next week, according to Zimmermann.

The proposals, which Zimmermann said are ‘‘not major,”’
call for changes in the Area Distribution Requirements.

“At the present moment there is no clear rationale, (for the
requirements)'* Zimmermann said, ‘‘We think our proposals
make them more systematic and comprehensive.”’

The proposals would have to be passed by late February,
the deadline for the College catalogue, in order to affect next year’s
freshman class. They would not affect present students.

Zimmermann said he expects there will be several open
meetings within the faculty before any vote is held.

“The EPC will certainly hold a hearing under the auspices
of the SGA if there is student interest,’’ he added.
