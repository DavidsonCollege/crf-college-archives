SOUTHERN CONFERENCE TOURNAMENT SPECIAL

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1997

Men poised for NCAA run in Greensboro

In what was supposed to be a rebuilding year, Wildcats again enter tourney as one of favorites

A swarm of press surrounded
Bob McKillop’s table at the pre-
season media tip-off some four
months ago.

The team

Davidson’s men’s basketball
team, 25-5 overall and 14-0 in the
Southern Conference a year ago,
was horribly undermanned and
maybe not even .500 material.

The Wildcats, NIT participants
in two of the last three seasons,
were finally going to experience the
sting of defeat, something it had
dished out so mercilessly last year.

That was the main story. Not
UT-Chattanooga’s NBA prospect
Johnny Taylor. Not Western Caro-
lina and its near-miss against top-
seeded Purdue in last year’s
NCAA’s. And not the league’s
three new head coaches. Davidson
was going to be bad.

Gone were four starters, three
all-conference selections, 72% of
the points scored, 65% of the min-
utes, and 55% of the rebounds.

How could the Wildcats possi-
bly succeed, led by a bunch’ of
unprovens and unknowns staring at
one of the toughest pre-conference
schedules in the country?

“Looks like a rebuilding year,
Bob,” one reporter said, virtually
on behalf of all the others.

“That’s what everyone says,”
replied McKillop with a sly smile
and a sort of suave confidence.

He did, however, admit, “With
what we’ve lost, the expectations
would be a real question mark for
us.

“This isn’t a year that’s going
to make or break the program, but it
is going to influence the future.”

If that’s the case, the forecast
for Davidson basketball has NCAA
written all over it. And perhaps
sooner than later.

“T believe we have talent and
that talent matures and grows,” said
McKillop at the time. “Whether
that happens in February or March
or not until next season, who
knows?”

Well, then is now.

Those questions have all been
answered, and the Wildcats are 17-
9, 10-4, heading into the winner-
take-all league tourney having won
six in arow and nine of their last ten.

Point guard Ali Ton has stepped

right into the shoes of last year’s
court leader Chris Alpert and is
among the nation’s assists leaders
at 6.8 per game.

The power forward void left by
superstar Brandon “Ozone” Will-
iams has been filled beyond all ex-
pectations by Landry Kosmalski,
almost a sure shot for league Fresh-
man-of-the- Year.

Mark Donnelly, an inconsis-
tent bench player last season, has
become atrue game-breaking threat.

Narcisse Ewodo, the lanky,
soft-spoken slasher and the lone
senior starter on this year’s young
squad, has quietly. - in his own way
- led this team.

The bench, an essential part of -

any Bob McKillop squad, has come
on strong lately, adding quality
depth to the roster and giving the
starters rest that should pay divi-
dends if the Wildcats want to win
three games in as many days to‘earn
one of the 64 coveted NCAA slots.

And McKillop, who was put

on automatic pilot by last year’s
runaway freight train, has demon-
strated just what a superior instruc-
tor and motivator he is, molding an
iffy bunch into a rock-solid unit —
every individual on the same page,
the same mission,
_ “Bobby’s an outstanding
coach,” lauded Duke’s Mike
Kryzyzewski after his Blue Devils’
85-58 victory overthe Wildcats Dec.
11 at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
“T’m surprised we won by the mar-
gin we did. They’re a team where
the sum is greater than the total of
its parts.”

Co-favorites Marshall and
Chattanooga have struggled lately,
leaving the door wide open for
Davidson, which has—as McKillop
had originally hoped—becomea dan-
gerous team playing its best basket-
ball at the best possible time.

Through what are becoming
Davidson trademarks—intense de-
fensive pressure leading to easy of-
fense, and fundamentals and court
savvy-the Wildcats are right where
they want to be and have estab-
lished themselves as a perennial
player in the conference elite.

“I think we’re working on
something special here,” said
Kosmalski after the Marshall loss
Feb. 3 at Huntington, W.Va. “Ev-
eryone here, we can kind of feel it.
We’re going to get stuff done.”

The Wildcats haven’ tlost since.

And this was supposed to be an
off year.

Donnelly’s unselfishness, hot hand lead way

When Mark Donnelly spends

ten minutes after each game talk- ~

ing with young Davidson fan Chris
Hathcock of Belmont, he exhibits
the same unselfishness that has

The shooter

made his junior year so success-
ful.

“I am not a selfish person,”
said the New Jersey native in an
interview last week. “Coach al-

ways says that when things aren’t
going well with you, help some-
body else. As a leader, I try to
contribute anyway I can.”

The 6-foot-5 shooting guard
averages over 13 points, four re-
bounds, and two assists a game, all
career highs.

A big jump for a guy who last
year scored six points a contest.

Still, along with senior Narcisse
Ewodo, he was given the reins to
pilot the Wildcats this season. And
Donnelly’s shift in duty was, at
first, a bit intimidating for the co-
captain.

“Most of the’ pressure came
from myself. I had to get into the

right mindset.”

’ But numbers cannot begin to
convey Donnelly’s true impact on
this Davidson squad. f

“Mark contributes to this team
in so many ways, whether it is
making the big shot or doing all of
the little things that he always
does,” said coach Bob McKillop.
“His unselfishness is amazing.
Quite simply, he is Saint Mark.”

“He keeps us going in prac-
tice everyday. When we need the
big play, he’s always there,”
Landry Kosmalski said recently.

McKillop would prefer you

his own, though what he and his

is certainly front-page news.
