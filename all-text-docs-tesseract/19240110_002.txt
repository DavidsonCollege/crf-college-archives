Names of Men Pledged

Freshmen to be Initiated After Com-
pletion of First Term’s Work |

A revised list of the fraternity pledges
and initiates taken in during the fall at Da-
vidson College shows that 4 total of 63 stu-
dents, the majority of them freshmen, have
heen or are to be received into membership
of the Greek letter organizations.

Rules for Bids to fraternities have been
changed recently by the college faculty, thus
moving the rushing period up several weeks
earlier than in former years.

The following is the revised list, includ-
ing several upperclassmen: |

Pi Kappa Alpha—J. M. White, L. M.
Ham, R. H. Buckner, L. D. Elkins, T. G.
McSwain.

Kappa Alpha—R. L. Mitchell, J. H. Me-
Connell, E. F. Bohannon, T. F. Anderson,
Z. Varnedoe, J. W. Keerans, A. S. Robin-
son.

Kappa Sigma—V. Williamson, R. R. |
Glenn, J. D. Malloy, J. A. Simpson, F. L.
Wyche, J. I. Groover, H.'O. Sapp, R: B.
McConnell, J. C. Bernhardt.

Beta Theta Pi—T. E. Gray, J. A. King, |
A. S. Farnsworth, O. M. Farnsworth, W.
H. Branch, R. L. Lincoln, W. R. Sparrow,
J. F. Pinckney, Perry Priest.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon—J. E.

Trinity has licked a couple of Virginia teams
already and is looking good.

We saw Va. Tech. play Xmas. They have
a big hard veteran team that rings anything
in sight but is slow on their feet.

We could have seen Georgia too but our
date didn’t like basketball. Perhaps we'll
have another girl next year.

Tech beat the Protestant Club of Savan-
nah 39-9; Georgia licked them 31-19.

Albany (Ga.) “Y” seems to be the best
yet. In about 10 days they licked the At-
lanta Athletic Club (8 points); Ga. Tech
(5 points); Georgia, Wofford and Spar-
tanburg “Y.” That looks like the Southern
championship in a week.

Carolina only beat Charlotte “Y" 31-29,
That means that first game will be a corker.

500 Wildcats in Charlotte for the Carolina
game. What do you say, fellows?

Get the “Billy” Sunday special busses and
trot out the U-push ’ems.

Walking is good in the nice, brisk weather,
too.

Americans lick Canadians.

Mercer’s Trail—Spartanburg “Y,” States-
ville Athletic Club, Greensboro “Y,” N. C.
State, Trinity. (maybe). Those are all we
have heard of.

Guilford has the two Frazier lads back,
which means an interesting time for the
’Cats.

And Carolia. Don't mention it. McDon-
ald, Carmichel, McDonald again, Green and
Cobb. That is something else interesting.

Kentucky 33, Vanderbilt 13. Kentucky
has a Sophomore team. Two years ago they
won the National Prep. Tourney. Perhaps
Vandy has a good team after all.

And say, fellows, how about dropping
those basketball scores by 31 Georgia. We
can't keep up with them all.

tance from the goal, and will force them to
take long shots.

Who the other two of the quintet will be
has not been decided. Nappy Davis (cap-
tain), Speck McConnell, Mac Beall, Dan
Mallory, Liston Elkins, Ed Morrison and
Litch Huie are all contenders for these po-
sitions. The first four are already letter
men, while the remaining ones. showed up
well in class games. In addition to the above,
Hewlett and Sapp, at guard, and Hudgins,
at center, all of whom are Freshmen, have
been showing an art in the cage game in
their practices at the gym, and Coach Monk
has intimated that he may use one of these
three to fill one of the gaps.

The first game of the season will be Mon-
day night, when the Wildcats meet Char-
lotte “Y" at the City Auditorium. The
Queen City team is considered one of the
best “Y” teams in the state, and the relative
strength of the Wildcat fighters may be
estimated after this fracas. It will be of
interest to many students of the upper
classes to know that Alex McMillan, Wild-
Kitten player last year, is occupying a for-
ward position on the Charlotte team, and is
playing a fast and creditable game with that
quint.

Only one or two sliglit changes occur in
the schedule. A survey of the
card shows that eight games will be played
on the local court, and three in Charlotte,
with the possibility of more at these two
points. Only one trip will be made, includ-
ing three games, one each at Wake Forest,
{Raleigh and Guilford. The date of Feb-
lruary 9th is open, but a game for that night
will be scheduled within the next few days.

Efforts are still being made through the
officials to get the team in the Southern
tournament in Atlanta. If this fails there

HEARD AT INDIANAPOLIS

Mr. Roberf\P. Wilder, general secre-
tary of the Student Volunteer Move-
ment, who has attended every one of
these conventions said that the one just

held was the best convention in the
history of the movement.
The first report of the registration

showed that there were 7,400 delegates
representing over 30 countries.

By an overwhelming majority the con-
vention went on record as supporting
the following proposal:

“We believe war is un-Christian an

that the League of Nations is the best |:

means of preventing it, but’ we would
resort to war in case an inevitable dis-
pute has been referred to the:League or
War Council without successful settle-
ment.”

With Crawford and Mauze gone, the cen-
ter and floor guard positions present a prob-
lem, but notwithstanding this, the Davidson
cagers ought to have a successful season, and
the student body is going to have a chance to
give them their full support at many of the
contests.

| STUDENTS BACK AT WORK

| (Continued from page 1)

studying remain before the one great event
of the scholastic year. The examination
schedule has: not been given out as yet by
Professor Wood, chairman of the com-
mittee, but it is thought that it will follow
materially the order of both exams held
| § car, allowing a maximum of time be-
| Sen successive examinations to allow for
preparation.

The southern wing of Chambers will be
started this spring, according to all reports
'from officials, and this work, together with
other campus improvements, will see the
‘campus once more in a state of hurried ac-
tivity, approximating the work done in con-
structing the three new dormitories that now
grace Davidson’s grounds. The new Rich-
ardson Athletic Field will be ready for
spring football and baseball practice. Al-
though the proposed stadium has not been
erected, the field itself offers an attraction to
all athletes and lovers of outdoor sports
with its two fine gridirons, cinder track, and
turfed baseball diamond.

Much interest is being manifested in the
coming basketball season, which offers a
heavy schedule for the Wildcat cagers,
nevertheless the prospect of many hard-
fought games with colleges of several
Southern states. Coach Younger has an ex-
perienced bunch of players rounding into
form and a winning team will no doubt be’
the outcome from the squad that is practic-
ing daily on the gym floor. Wrestling will
soon narrow down to a select squad of the
many competitors now practicing. Captain
Weems has a husky bunch at work on the
mat, all putting forth effort in anticipation
of meeting grapplers from Virginia and
the Carolinas during the coming months.

The college heating plant, finished last
year, is giving good service in spite of the
cold wave which is the coldest snap enjoyed
by Davidsonians since the phenomenal -winter
of 1917-18. This plant was made with room
for the accommodation of the proposed
buildings when they are built, thus doing
away with all inconveniences due to lack of
centralized heating units.

The spring term of 1923-24 session bids
fair to eclipse all previous terms as. regards
athletics and scholarships. Only limited
equipment prohibits the taking in of a much
larger number of new men next fall than
ever before. Future improvements will no

doubt see the increased enrollment that has
been the dream of both students and faculty
alike.

THIS FALL

Short,threebutton,
half-belted ulsters
are to be greatly
favored this fall.
You'll see many
of them; but none
like the Society

The difference is in
the cut. There’s an air
about this overcoat that
you will find nowhere
else; it’s smartly cut;
every detail—the roll of
the lapel, the spacing of
the buttons, the placing
of the pockets-is exactly
right.

ther mixtures, colorful

you like, we have it.
