Music Review

Woodstock,
the Eagles
make for a
summer of
remakes

By Tom Bavis

Musically, the summer of
1994 may stick in peoples’ memo-
ries as one of the most important,
alongside such greats as the sum-
mer of 1967 and — dare I mention
it so soon — 1969. Much hap-
pened inall realms of popular music
as we experience it.

Through our presence at con-
certs, purchases at stores, turns of
the radio dial, and guilty minutes
in front of MTV, we witnessed the
rise of new groups, the resuscita-
tion of old ones, and endless com-
parisons between the summer of
Woodstock ’69 and Woodstock
94.

The Rolling Stones, Pink
Floyd, Traffic, and the Eagles

jumped upon the summer band-
wagon this summer after years of
seeming inactivity. The Eagles
deserved much of the criticism
hurled their way for gouging ticket
buyers.

Among their convincing jus-
tifications was Glenn Frey’s claim
that they did not charge as much as
Barbra Streisand — logic one
should expect from a singer who
was last seen pumping iron on
Holiday Fitness Center ads.

Old-age jokes about the now
Bill Wyman-less Stones came
harder -than ever with the
Nationsbank-sponsored ‘Voodoo
Lounge Tour.”

Probably the best jokes thrown
their middle-aged way appeared
on David Letterman’s “Top Ten
Things Overheard at the Rolling
Stones Opening Show at RFK Sta-
dium,” which included, “Start me
up; no, really, this is not part of the
song.”

As those groups counted their
increasing millions, one of the best
Lollapalooza tours to date
screeched and blasted its way
across the nation. Headliners
Beastie Boys and Smashing Pump-
kins deserved every cent they
earned promoting their excellent
albums. The medium-sized Breed-
ers and Green Day also put in stel-
lar sets.

All the noise Smashing Pump-
kins and company made from the
Lollapalooza mainstage, alas,
could not compete against the deaf-
ening hype — surrounding
Woodstock ’94. At this summer’s
Woodstock, performers both
young and old climbed on stage
before about 300,000 ticketholders
and freeloaders alike. Sometimes
it seemed as though the people
who were not actually there, camp-

Wine has been a part of
civilization for thousands of
years. Archaelogical evidence
shows that wine was being made
as early as 12,000 years ago.
Organized vineyards were found
in Mesopotamia around 2000
B.C., and by the time of the
Phoenicians, viniculture had
spread throughout the Mediterra-
nean. In the Roman era, wine
was associated with decadence
and magic. During the Middle
Ages, the church kept up wine
making, and monks bred grapes
that eventually evolved into
today’s grape varieties.

Since 1875, France has led
the world in wine commerce,
followed by Italy, Spain, Algeria,
Portugal, Argentina, Greece, and
the United States.. Approxi-
mately 90% of the United States’
wine comes from California.
Because grapes can be cultivated
in most temperate climates, wine
production takes place on almost
every continent

About an hour’s drive down
I-77 in rural Chester County,
South Carolina, one can visit the
Cruse Vineyards. A tour of the
vineyard can be a fascinating
experience if you’re curious to
see the procedures involved in
wine making. Owners Kenneth
and Susan Cruse have operated
the vineyard since 1987, and they
have five acres of plants, mainly
two types called vanifera and
French hybrid. These grapes are
quite different from the table
variety and are made exclusively
for wine, with a high acidity and
sugar content.

The vineyard is set back in
the woods down a long, gravel

road. During August, the grapes
are harvested, and Kenneth
Cruse says that-it is important
that they be processed as soon as
possible. An Italian-made
machine known as the Stemmer-
Crusher separates the juice and

. pulp from the leaves. Another

machine removes 80% of the
juice from the pulp, and the
remaining pulp is placed in a
basket press, which collects the
last 20% of the juice. Cruse
Vineyards feeds the remaining
pulp to its livestock. Interest-
ingly enough, in Spain and
Portugal grapes are still tread
upon to extract their juice.

Now that the juice has been
isolated, it must be analyzed for
levels of sugar and pH, total

- acids, and carboxylic acids. This

determines how the juice will be
fermented. For six to eight
weeks, the juice rests in steel
tanks, where it ferments at 56
degrees Farenheit. Yeasts
present after the juice is pressed
release enzymes which change
sugars into alcohol and carbon
dioxide. The oxygen supply
must be regulated or else bacteria
could form that would change
the alcohol into acetic acid.
After fermentation, the wine is
then pumped off the sediment
several times. Before he bottles
it, Cruse chills it at 26 degrees
for four to six weeks to remove
cream of tarter. The wine is
filtered and then placed in
sterilized bottles.

This entire procedure from
harvest to bottling takes two to
three years for white wine and

three to five years for red. After
bottling, the Cruses wait approxi-
mately three to six months to
release it. The date that appears
on wine bottles is the year the
fruit is harvested.

Mr. Cruse says that.this year
has been particularly rough for
wine making in this area. Deer
have gotten into the vineyards
and devoured a lot of the fruit,
and the rainy summer hurt the
grapes, which prefer a dry, sunny
climate.

‘ Once purchased, a wine can
“turn” easily, and the consumer
must take care to prevent this by
protecting the wine from extreme
femperatures, drafts, and light.
Wines should be stored in an

* area with an even temperature

between 45 and 70 degrees.
Once opened, be sure to store the
wine on its side to prevent the
corks from drying out, which can
cause oxygen to turn the wine.

Before serving a red wine,
remove the cork and allow the
wine to “breathe” for at least an.
hour at room temperature. Chill
white wines, champagnes, and
rosés at about 50 degrees; a
lower temperature will kill the
flavor.

After a tour of the winery,
visitors are allowed to sample the
wines, which are also available
for sale. The Cruse Winery is
open to the public from 3:30 p.m.
to 6 p.m. on Fridays and from
noon until 6 p.m. on Saturdays.
It’s about an hour’s drive from
Davidson. To go, take the
Highway 9 exit off of I-77. Turn
right and go a few miles until
you see a sign on your right for
Cruse Vineyards. Take another
right, and follow the signs.

Thumbs up for Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers

By Tammy Tiska

First I saw Platoon. For
months afterwards, I had recurring
dreams that I was killing people. In
his latest effort, Oliver Stone once
again draws us, unwillingly, into
the almost implausibly violent
world of Natural Born Killers.

modern-day serial killers who be-
come media celebrities after a three
year killing spree down a western
highway. Stone’s use of animation
and his grinding music sequences
redefine sensory overload, but af-
ter the initial:disorientation wears
off, we realize that we are con-

~ fronting the very concept of real-~
ity. Is it Micky’s nightmarish drug -

trip, or Mallory’s twisted memo-
ries, or something we all just de-
cided on, like the evening news?
Stone gives life to the irrational
side of the human psyche, suggest-
ing itis perhaps more real than that
