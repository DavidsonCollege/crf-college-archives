FREEDOM OF THE PRESS

Two students at the University of Cal-
ifornia, Fred C. Foy, editor of the Daily
Californian, and Brooks Darlington, pres-
ident of a journalistic society, have been
subjected to presidential discipline for
suggesting that high finance may not be
unknown on a university campus, The
Daily Californian gave impetus by a news
item to a charge developed in Razberry
Press, vermillion-hued organ of the jour-
nalists, that a member of the faculty had
palmed off onto the University his home
for a price far beyond its worth. Dean
Hart was chairman of a faculty commit-
tee that recommended the purchase of his
residence for $45,000, to be used as the
new Rockefeller International House. The
Razberry ‘Press insisted that the dean’s
house was valued at $20,000, and suggested
that the academician had made a nice
deal. President W. W. Campbell denied
the insinuations, and said the price had
been fixed by appraisers. He then pro-
ceeded to threaten censorship for the out-
spoken paper, and punishment of the edi-
tors involved.—_The New Student.

Geo. W. Coan, Alumnus

Resigns As Bank Head

Davidson Alumnus Withdraws to
Devote Time to Private Interests

Word has just reached Davidson
through the press of the state that George
W. Coan, Jr., 11, pioneer industrial bank-
er of Winston-Salem, will resign from the
presidency of the Morris Plan Bank of
that city on February 15th to devote his
entire time to the private interests of his
father and himself.

Mr., Coan, assisted by his father and a
local boatd of directors, organized the
Morris Plan Bank in Winston-Salem in
July, 1927, with a capital stock of $40,000,
This was the first industrial bank to locate
in Winston-Salem, and its progress has
been hardly short of phenomenal. From
a capital of $40,000 ten years ago, the bank
under the direction of Mr. Coan has
grown until it today boasts capital stock
to the amount of $100,000, the increase
having been occasioned by the demands
of a growing city. The surplus and undi-
vided profits of the bank, according to
its December statement, totaled $17,576.81,
after deducting 10 per cent in dividends
paid for the year 1927.

Mr. Coan, who was graduated from Da-
vidson in 1911, has been honored several
times by the National Association of Mor-
ris Plan Industrial Banks, having been
elected twice to the Board of Governors
of the national association,. At the last
meeting Mr. Coan was clected one of the
seven members of the executive commit-
tee, being the only southern man elected
to the committee in several years.

Book and Stationery Co.
is Latest Concern Here

Operated by Former Students of the
University of North Carolina

On January the twelfth the Davidson
Book and Stationery Company was open-
ed in the store owned by W. S, Hender-
son. This store will be managed by K,; W.
Mosely, L. H. Gooch, and G E, Ashley
who were former students of the Univer-
sity of North Carolina. Before coming
here they had a store similar to the one
here at Chapel Hill.

This store has already become popular
for many of our students. It’s purpose is
to cater to the needs and whims of the
students and the motto is “Service and
Quality.”

The Davidson Book and_ Stationery
Company will handle all the popular mag-
izines, kodaks, victrola records, and a
complete line of student supplies.
