Davidson College has
raised its tuition deposit fee,
due April 1, from $100 to $200.
The $200 deposit is partially
refundable—that is, students
who pay the fee, then decide not
to return to Davidson in the fall:
will receive $100 back if they
inform the college of their
decision by August 1.
“In the past, if a student
— sure he would be back in

the fall, he’d make the $100
deposit anyway,’’ said Director
of Admissions and Financial
Aid H. Edmunds White, who
proposed the larger refundable
deposit. —

Many of those who were
undecided about their. plans
would never tell the college if
they did decide not to come
back, or they would tell us just
before school started, White
explained.

“When the college is not
certain until school starts
exactly how many students are
returning, it is difficult to

Linden is 29.

David Rice will teach
history and humanities next
year. Rice received his BA from
Boston College in 1966, his MA
and Ph.D. from Yale. He is
presently teaching at Williams
College.

Rice’s specialty is ancient his-
tory. He has had several articles
and papers published, among
them ‘Agesilaus, Agesipolis and

Spartan Politics, 386-379 B.C.”,
“Diodorus, Xenophon and the
Year 379/8 B.C.: Reconstruction
and Re-appraisal’’, and ‘‘Some
Remarks on the Trial of Timo-
theus’’. He also has two books in
progress: Sources for Greek Reli-
gion, From Lysander to Alexan-
der: Greek Politics and Policy in
the Fourth Century B.C.

A member of the Davidson
class of 1968, Robert Myers will
be the new Sociology teacher.
Myers did his graduate study at
UNC where he earned his Ph.D.

Myers, who specializes in
anthropology, has the following
papers in preparation: ‘‘Cleft
Lip and Cleft Palate in NC:
Interracial Incidence and
Possible Increase’’,
‘*Ecological and
Ethnohistorical Explanations:
The Case for Dominica’s

Carbils’’, ‘‘West Indian
Migration as a Rite of
Passage’’, ‘‘Dominican

Migration in the Late 19th

Century”’ and Dominica: A Com-

us for the right to rebroadcast,’
Lawrimore explained.

“T don’t know at this point how
many dollars any of these can
bring in, but I don’t think it’s
unreasonable to assume that we
can raise enough for the $28,000
operating budget.”

The WDAV Board of Directors
is holding meetings to discuss
Lawrimore’s proposal and other
plans for the station.

“‘We held a meeting last Thurs-
day to discuss programming,”
Lawrimore said.

‘Projections now are for clas-
sical music from mid-afternoon to
mid-evening—about four to ten
pm, but that hasn’t been decided
yet.

“The Board agreed that we will
have to get on the air and make
ourselves known before we can get
a reliable reading on dane people
want.

“The Board will continue to
have meetings to discuss more
definitely staffing, and to set
down more specific objectives and
purposes.

Lawrimore commented on the
role of the Media Board—the
body set up by the Trustees as an
overseer of the student media— in
determining the plans for the
radio station.

“The radio station will require so

much attention and thought that
it needs its own board (at this
time).

“When things are running
smoothly, the Media Board could

be expanded to include the radio
station.

“Tf the Media Board had to
tackle all the radio station's
problems now, it might never get
anything else done,"’ Lawrimore
said.

The psychology department
still has two vacancies to fill,
one in abnormal psychology and
one in cognitive experimental
and human learning. No
decision has been made as yet,
according to Dr. Jay Ostwalt.

Overall there has been very
little student participation in
the selection of the new
professors. A few informal
meetings were the extent of it.
Holland reasoned that students
should not be allowed to see the
letters of recommendation.

Purcell added that the
candidates were not asked to
teach any classes because,
“The college professor is above
student teaching.”’

achieve maximum enrollment

-with all dorms filled.’’

“In effect,” said White, ‘‘we
are offering (the student) a $100
incentive to inform us of his
plans by August 1.”

By learning early of a
student’s intention not to return,
White says he can accept ap-
plicants from the waiting list for
entry to the freshman class.

White acknowledged that
raising the fee substantially
only two weeks before it is due
might work a hardship on some
families.

“T’ve talked about this plan
with students, Dean Terry, and
other administrators since
October,’’ explained White,
“but there were always other
decisions that were more
pressing.”

“I guess it’s my fault
because I didn’t push for it,’’ he
admitted. |

“Anytime you can give
people more warning you have.
an improved situation. If we
could have announced this
(increase) in October, it would
have been better.’’

White indicated that past
policy of his department has
been to consider hardship cases
on an individual basis.

“If somebody had a serious
problem coming up with the
extra $100 right now—such as
those on full financial aid—this
office would be willing to listen
to a request for an extension on
the payment,’’ White said.
