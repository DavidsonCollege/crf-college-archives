Looking For
A Bargain Breakfast?

By Meredith Boone |

For the past three years, Cof-
feehouse has been providing an
opportunity for students, faculty,
and staff to mingle while they
partake of breakfast food at bar-
gain prices. Each Tuesday morn-
ing from 8:30 to 11:00 in the 900
Room, the Union offers coffee,
juice, tea, and doughnuts for 10
cents apiece. While Coffeehouse
will occasionally seek variety by
featuring muffins, croissants, or
bagels, doughnuts are the staple
menu item.

Three years ago, in response
to student complaints about the
increasing decentralization of
Davidson, the Union Board con-
ceived of Coffeehouse as a way for
the college to remain in contact.
Currently, many Davidsonians do
enjoy Coffeehouse, as the Union
typically goes through 36 dozen
doughnuts every Tuesday.

However, many pcople, espe-
cially freshmen, aren’t aware of
this Union-subsidized social and
eating event. As Junior Ann Todd

said, “I wish someone had clued
me in to Coffeehouse when I was a
freshman. It took me an entire
semester to figure it out. You buy
two six packs of Coke on your
meal card in the Cafe, and then go
spend 30 cents on two doughnuts
anda glass of orange juice. What a
bargain!”

Currently, tapes are played
during Coffechouse, butthe Union
hopes to eventually have student
musicians provide the entertain-
ment. Anyone interested in per-
forming or who has suggestions
for future food features should
contact Missy Anderson or Julie
Dixon, the Chairs of the 900 Room
committee.

So, be sure to stop by the 900
Room tomorrow morning between
your Classes and grab some suste-
nance to help you make it through
the day. It’s a greatchance to listen
to music, mingle with friends, and
eat great food at discounted prices.
What more could a Davidson stu-
dent want?

To Diet Or Not To Diet? That Is The Question

Liz said...

DIETS RARELY WORK. Ask
Oprah Winfrey. Ask anyone who
thinks they are overweight. They
will tell you how many times they
have tried to diet, all the different
diets they have tried, and most
importantly, how many pounds
they have gained back.

People who goon diets remind
me of people who cram for tests,
but do none of the reading before-
hand and miss a lot of class. They
are always amazed when they don’t
get the grade they had hoped for.
Liquid diets, special programs, and
low calorie foodarea lot like cram-
ming. If you starve yourself for a
few weeks, you will lose weight.
But don’t be shocked when you
gain it back. Just as a night of
cramming can’t make up for a
whole semester of studying, a few
weeks of dieting can’t make up for
a whole lifetime of eating wrong.

There isan intrinsic difference
between how fat people and thin
people eat. People always say
things like, “I have gland problems
or a low metabolism. My room-
mate eats all day and doesn’t gain
a pound. I eat half what he does,
and I gain weight.” First of all, a
very, very small percentage of the
population has gland problems. As
for.a low metabolism, that might
be acontributing factor, but not all
people with low metabolisms are
fat. The reason thin people eat and
don’t gain weight is because they
eat right. If you are overweight,
‘don’t “go on a diet”; change your
eating habits. Start eating like the
thin person you want to become.

Thin people eatonly when they
are hungry. For the thin person,
eating is a biological function that
satisfies hunger. The thin person
enjoys eating, but realizes that there
isa time to eat anda time notto eat.
Even sitting at a dinner table, you
can tell the difference between
someone who eats right and some-
one who does not.
Someone whoeats right

Balloonists Take To The Air
In The Statesville Balloon Rally

By Richard Wharton

The Eighteenth: Annual Na-
tional Balloon Rally took place
this weekend at the Statesville
Municipal Airport in front of an
estimated 50,000 spectators from
all around the Carolinas. Over 100
hot-air balloons from around: the
country participated in the event,
held for the D.A.R.E. to keep kids
off drugs charity fund-raiser.

The festivities began on Fri-
day evening when wind conditions
became favorable enough for a
mass-ascension from the airport.
All balloons inflated on each side
of the runway, making a “Balloon
Canal” that, once launched, filled
the skies with all types of colors
and designs. The balloons lifted at
random and flew in the direction of
the setting sun before setting down
in nearby fields to pack up for
Saturday’s events.

Saturday morning began with
a CNT, or Course and Naviga-
tional Trajectory competition. For
this type of contest, a telephone
poleis placed at the apex of the two
runways with a ring keychain on
top of it. A 30 foot X is then placed
around the pole. Balloonists then

time you stop yourself, you’re a
step closer to developing good
eating habits.

People who overeat often lose
their ability to gage their own
hunger. They know they want the
food, but they have no idea whether
they need it or not. This is why
changing bad eating habits is hard

use their navigational skills (and a
little luck) to leave the airport, find
a direct path toward the marker,
and launch, hoping that the winds
will take them directly over the X.
If they are successful, they can
either try for the Key ring, which
contains a set of keys to a new car,
or drop a baggie attached to a
streamer to get as close to the X as
possible. Points and awards are
given for cumulative and individ-
ual competitions.

On Saturday evening, the bal-
loonists flew in what is called the
“Hare and Hound” competition.
One balloon, being the hare, lifts
off and the other balloonists, after
ashort period of time, launch after
the “Hare.” The “Hare”, once it
lands, lays out an X on the ground,
and itis the job of the balloonists to
subsequently drop their baggies as
close to the X as possible. This
requires exact timing and knowl-
edge. of the winds, as even the
slightest change in wind or altitude
can send a balloon off course.

Sunday morning ended the
competition with half the balloons
launching out of the Airport for a
“Hare and Hound” and the other

was eating. It became second na-
ture for me to eat whenever food
was around. When my. clothes
started to get too small, and I real-
ized I was embarrassed to wear a
bathing suit in front of anyone, I
decided to be more careful about
what I ate. I didn’t go on any spe-
cial diet, but lost the weight and I
kept it off. Now,
eating seems as

doesn’t try to control
the amount he or she
eats. This individual
simply eats until he or
she is satisfied, whether
this means five helpings
or four bites. These
people often leave food
on their plate, because
they don’ teatafterthey
feel full.

Thin people also do
not eat excessively
when they are upset or
stressed. out. They do

natural and easy to
me as brushing my
teeth or taking a
shower. I don’t
deprive or indulge
myself, and my
weight remains
pretty constant.
If you are over-
- weight, don’t be
discouraged. True,
diets don’t work.
Buteating correctly
does. Once you’ve
mastered this, you

nothead for the refresh-
ment table at parties so
that they will have something to
do. When food is in the room, they
do not feel compelled to eatit, any-
more than you would feel com-
pelled to go to the bathroom if
there was a toilet in front of you.
In the beginning, changing
your eating habits involves self-
discipline. People constantly jus-
tify over-eating by saying, “What
will two brownies hurt?” or “I'll
starve myself tomorrow.” It is not
the actual brownies that make the
difference. It is the eating habit.
Every time you let yourself over-
eat, it gets easier to do again. Every

in the beginning. It requires con-
stant thought. Each time you grab
something to eat, you have to
consciously: ask yourself, “Am I
hungry? Do I need to be eating
this?” If you aren’t sure, put the
food back. Wait a while. Eventu-
ally, you will honestly feel hungry.

This process of forcing your-
self not to overeat is tedious at
first. I know. I gained a lot of
weight my sophomore year of high
school, because! got into the habit
of eating whenever I was bored
(and I was bored a lot). I began to
realize that I hardly even noticed I

will stay thin for-
ever. Hungeris your
body’s way of telling you it needs
to be fed. Following your body’s
natural cues is a lot more effective
than’ drinking artificial protein
shakes.

Dair said...

Okay, so once you've got the
technique down you’ve got to
decide what to eat. That’s my half
of the deal this week. You’ ve heard
about the four food groups since
your embryonic stage so I won’t
go on about how each one of them
attributes to your overall well
being. Alright, alright. . .so I’m

half coming into the airport for a
CNT competition. Spectators were
thus able to observe the full com-
plement of balloons in the sky at
one timé. For many, it was an
unforgettable sight.

Ballooning has been around
since the time of the sixteenth
century, when the Montgolfier
Brothers designed balloons in
France. Though modern balloon-
ing is inherently safe, inthose days,
landing balloons were thought to
be smoking dragons landing in their
fields. Scared and confused, they
attacked these balloons in order to
kill them. In order to end such
confusion, the brothers began to
take along champagne in order to
appease their public. This tradition
has been followed as balloonists
maintain their values of “Cham-
pagne and Propane-- Breakfast of
Balloonists!”

Several Davidson students
participated in this weekend’s rally,
working as assistant launch direc-
tors, in order to gain their first
involvement in the sport. Balloons
and their pilots are’ great entertain-

The number one point to re-

not talking about switching from
Little Debbie Swiss Cakes to Moon

still need to keep your energy up,

Six servings of breads- - whole
wheat, brown rice , corn, potatoes
(they’ll do the trick), pasta, cereals

it often keeps people from having

breads and white bread itself is a
refined food that contains signifi-
cantly less fiber. Bagels are awe-

vegetables- - once again, the idea
here is variety. As much as you
possibly can (and I realize how

places available to us) try to eat

don’t give you the same vitamins

be good for fibrous pectin, it’s not
