the notice of the smallest withdrawal

Under the leadership of Allen Frew
in the freshman year the class began
a number ,of new ideas which have
been carr out in great fashion. The
first class in the history of the school
to be guests at a Freshmen banquet,
entered the college in 1926. The Char-
lotte Chamber of Commerce through
Mr. Clarence Kuester extended an in-
vitation to the Class of ’30 to banquet
and permission was granted by the
Court of Control for the exodus of the
fresh. Following soon after the first
achievement a motion was presented to
Prepare the treasury for the onslaught
of this Junior Speaking. With. the
passage of this motion the Class of '30
became the first in. the history of the
school to look ahead in preparing their
treasury by taxation of the members

However, time continued to fly by
and others dropngd from the roll of

the class of 1930. Returning from the
summer holidays of 1928 the Junior
class had one hundred ahd sixteen
members out of the one hundred and
eighty-four of the preceding year. This
aided in the decrease of the college
roll when there was a drop from six
hundred and forty-two to six hundred.

With the -entrance into the Junior
year came ‘recognition and reputation

McGuire Frew,

In September Nineteen Twenty-Six
the class of ‘30 was born. Over two
hundred was this class in its very in-
fancy, before the days of the grim
reaper; examinations. The first sem-
ester rolled by and the clase of 1930
had no guiding hand to lead it through
the many treacherous pitfalls of cam-
pus life. Then on a bright morn in
the month of February the Court of
Control trooped in and announced that
class officials were to be elected, im-
mediately the class went into a huddle,
votes were taken, and out of this bal-
loting came the first class officers.
Alan Frew, of Charleston, W. Va., was
chosen president; .Ben DeArmon, of
Charlotte, was chosen vice-president,
and Z. V. Long, of Statesville, was
elected secretary and treasurer.

Thus the year rolled along, the class’

with a leader now, prospering as it had
not done before, Soph Day. with its
dire. happenings came and became a
thing of the past, and suddenly the
class awoke to the fact that it was
time to elect another group of officers.
This time a group which would pilot
them through sophomore year. Again
heads went together and out of the
melee care Carl Pritchett, of Reidsville,
N. C., president: Tom Brohard, of
Grafton, W. Va., vice-president, and
Frank Brown, of Greensboro, secre-
tary and treasurer.

A whole year roils by—Soph Ban-
quet—Holidays—Exams — More Holi-
days—and Soph Day — and fortunes
and misfortunes together under the
guiding hand of these capable officers.

turned to elections, and through the
dust and smoke, came Z. V. Long, of
Statesville, to serve as president, Heath
Whittle, of Atlanta, our new vice-pres-
ident, and Bill McGuire, of Franklin,
N. C.. as secretary and treasurer.

The year is nearing a close and these
men who have served our class so
faithfully in the past must go on to
higher positions on the campus. It is
with pride that the class of Nineteen-
Thirty looks back on its officers; the
men who have_been chosen, and their
capability at handling the trust placed
upon them by the class. One more
group of officers will lead the class
through the mysteries of the senior
year, and out into the mysteries of the
outside world. May they be as effi-
cient and capable in the future as
they have been in the past.

The only one, the lonely colunm stands.
Today it stood with comrades three—
Their years were one and seventy; the sands
Of Time’s great hour gifs could see
No change except in growth of majesty.

Once were they portals of an edifice
Which had been built with eager hands
That worked with fervent purpose not amiss,
And reared a dome ere volunteering bands
Went. North to give themselves to war's demands.

Beneath that dome, between. those columns four,
Those who in later days were shown

To be true men, for three score years and more,
Trod in and out, at times in cap and gown,
Unknowing of their future name’s renown.

But devastation came—that stately dome
Was seen no more; but firm and fast
The columns stood in night and day and gloam—

A mighty remnant of a glorious past,
An inspiration to the very last.

No earlicr than this morn with solid. shafts
They stood together; now the night ~

A single column hides; a breeze now wafts
The others’ dust abdut thé one who's plight
It is to stand alone till morning's light.

And then, ah, then, it too is doomed to fall,
And mingle then with their debris—

Four relics brought to ruin at hasty call.
But hasty? No! for look beyond and sec!
Not the old—the new foremost shall be!

The duty of. the old was but to stay.
To lead, to guide, inspire the few

To see beyond, and mammoth plans to lay.
And now they have fulfilled their purpose true,
And so—Down with the old, up with the new!—
