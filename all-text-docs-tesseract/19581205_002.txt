Will Faculty Leave The Ivy Tower?

Last Saturday two hundred and

fifty members of the faculty of Emory

University released a signed state-
ment condemning the closing of pub-
lic schools for any reason.

The statement read. in part: “To
close the public schools in any city,
county, state, or region of America
at this critical stage of world history
is to play directly into the hands of
Communists.”

Such a statement. coming from
the conservative waste lands of
Georgia is worth noting — and prais-
ing.
It is refreshing to see a faculty
climb down from, the ivy tower's to
take a stand on a current and import-
ant issue.

It's high time that the tradition
of the retiring intellectual’ be kicked
out of the American social pattern.

This problem is especially critical
here in our South. For too long the
demagogues and political hucksters
have formed and voiced our public
opinion.

Courageous action by thinking
men might go a long wav toward
averting social tragedy in our land.

The DAVIDSONIAN congratulates
the faculty of Emory. and commends
them for setting a worthy example
for their colleagues throughout: the
nation, and particularly the South.

Would the Davidson faculty be
willing to take a stand on this issue

. or any issue?

The Emory statement did not con-
sider the question of integration. A
similar statement by the Davidson
Faculty need not raise this question.
but we fail to see how any conscientt-
ous man of education could feet un-
willing to speak out against the seem-
ingly imminent cessation of public
education in the South.

The objection may be made that
Emory is a ‘different type school.”
Actually the similarity with Davidson
is striking. Both are comparatively
small. church affiliated. and “South-
ern’ by location and inclination.

Again we ask: Is the faculty. any
part of the ‘faculty, or any single
faculty member willing to speak on
the school closing issue?

The pages of this paper will be
open next week or any week to a
statement on this question.

We wait with anticipation.

Action Asked On
Unlimited Cuts

Faculty response . to this week’s
opinion poll (see front page) was, as
usual, rather sparse, since fewer than
one-half of the professors took the
trouble to answer the questions sub-
mitted to them. In spite of this, a
clear trend of opinion is evident
among those who returned the poll:
nearly one-half favor some form of
unlimited cuts, and several more
would prefer some changes; only one-
fourth of those questioned were sat-
isfied with the present system.

Because of the poor response to
the questions, it is impossible to make
any sweeping conclusions on the mat-
ter. However, the existence of such
widespread dissatisfaction, with the
present system, along with the rather
large number who would establish un-
limited cuts, “makes a re-examination
of our cut system advisable. This
might have some surprising results;
certainly it is a hopeful sign that on-
ly one academic reactionary came out
for no cuts at all.

We realize that any change in the
cut system could come only gradual-
ly, after searching self-criticism on
the part of the faculty. Furthermore,
any change at all should be at first
on an experimental basis.

Therefore, the DAVIDSONIAN
wishes to make the following propos-
al: that the faculty study the matter
of liberalizing the cut system, and
that—if a majority of faculty mem-
bers vote for it — an experimental
change in the cut system be institut-
ed for. next semester: all juniors and
seniors with academic averages of 1.5
or better should be given unlimited
cuts.

In our opinion, the benefits from
such a change would far outweigh
any difficulties involved. It would

certainly be better than the present
system.——C.H.C.

Faculty Needs
Own Secretary

At the beginning of last summer,
President Martin appropriated a size-
able amount of money for furniture
in faculty offices, to be spent by each
professor in whatever way he saw fit.
This was the first such action by a

Davidson administration since several
carloads of army surplus chairs.
desks, bookcases, and filing cabinets
were distributed among professor’s
offices after the end of the war.

President Martin’s action shows
that. unlike some college presidents,
he comprehends the problems —
however seemingly minor or trivial —
of his faculty, and is willing to move
quickly to alleviate them. We would
like to point out another possible
area in which a small change could
be made that would eliminate a num-
ber of inconveniences, for faculty
members.

At the present time, there is one
half-time secretary to do typing and
stenographic work for the entire
faculty, with the exception of the
Physical Education and the Music De-
partments, who have fill time secre-
tarial help. As it now stands, this is
inadequate to meet the needs of the
faculty.

We realize that fiscal. considera-
tions often limit expansion in areas
where it is not an immediate neces-
sity. However, if at least the full-time
Services of one secretary could be
made available, faculty members
would have their work load consider-
ably lightened in routine matters —
such aS mimeographing tests and
writing letters of recommendation —
freeing them for tasks more directly
connected with their teaching and re-
search.—C.H.C.

Wanted:
One Nickname

Recent campus ‘bull sessions have
been impaired by a rather serious
semantic problem — as of now, we
have a President without a nickname.

Realizing that nicknames are a ,

cannot be hurried, the DAVIDSON-

title for our new President.

However, when the Student Body
is ready, we surely would find it a
help.

Dee Lide

Dear Editor:

I have finished re-reading the
editorial page of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN of November 21,
1958. I must admit that I am
throughly disgusted with the
whole thing. I feel that it is
time for one of the lower intel-
ligensia. or shall we say one
of the unenlightened ones of
this student body to speak out.

L should like to discuss the
quality of the material written
in such columns.as “Salmagun-
di’ and “The Philosophes” to
begin with.

J heard a fellow say the oth-
er day that the.mark of true
genius and greatness of a writ-,
er.or teacher is the art of he-
ing able to express his thoughts
simply. in a way which every-
oné can understand.

UTOPIAN SOCIETY

.Now I realize that this could
never pertain to Davidson Col-
‘lege, Davidson, N. C.. because
this is a utopian society, a sort
of ‘never, never land" in the
intellectual world; but it's

worth thinking about anyway.

Now I ask you, who in the
world wants to take time to
read the woes of an intellect
who trics to order a grilled
cheese in the Stud? I hate to
secm. unsympathetic but I just
don't care to read the plight of
this poor wronged fellow in his
quest of getting no mayonnaise
on his grilled cheese.

OUT TO LUNCH

Could it be that the author of
this column centers his story
around food because he is con-
tinually out to lunch? I really
thought everything tasted the
same when procured from the
inner sanctum of the Stud.
mayonnaise or no mayonnaise!

You have another type of
writer on your staff I should
like to mention. Ue should like
to be called the “friendly”
philosopher, I imagine. He real-
ly doesn't bother us because we
are of the opinion that nobody
can understand him anyway.

TYPICAL COLUMN

The title of a typical column
caught my eye. In bold black
type. it snid, “Fraternities Are
Now Meaningless.” ‘Well. says
I. “Ill read this and see why
fraternities are now meaning-
less.” No use. The author still
has the secret locked in his
head.

He does a good job of filling
up space with dictionary type
words though, 1 must admit.
Even we simple. fellows can do

The Golden City .

that. For example: see if “bell-
wether bedlamities” doesn’t de-

scribe you and your staff ade-
quately.

NO BUCK PRIVATES

Now to get down to more
serious and important matters.
You stated that President

Broyles answered questions con-
cerning the YMCA vaguely.
Have you ever stopped to con-
sider that the support given the
YMCA on this campus is very,
very vague. If the YMCA is a
student body organization, how
can you blame one man for it's
alleged shortcomings? No ef-
fective army can be run without
back privates!

I think President Broyles
should be commended on hav-
ing the intestinal fortitude to
attempt to reorganize the struc-
ture of the YMCA, It’s a hard
thing to do around here be-
eause we are opposed to
changes. We are conformists, or
haven't you heard?

Mr. Walker, I ask you to use
your power to help this re-or-
ganization be a success. I'm

sure you can find enough to

write about constructively with-
out slandering a fine campus
leader. Just remember that
miracles don’t take place over-
night. I ask you not to throw
stones until you get somcone
to help you move out of your
own glass house.

BOOK REVIEW

Critical Commentary Is Termed
“Surprisingly Bad” By Reviewer

By CHARLES CHASTAIN
Davidson Associate Editor

Some of My Best Friends Are
Professors: A Critical Commen-
tary On Higher Education, by
George Williams.

This book is surprisingly bad,
in view of the qualifications of
its author which are listed in
the preface: “I made absurdly
good grades in college, was the
second-highest man in my grad-
uating class... Iam known and
respected in my city and my

state ... I] have published four
books . . . I am in excellent
health . . . my salary is well

above the national median for
my academic rank.”

ANTI-CLIMAX

After this generous self-ad-

vertisement, Mr. Williams’ book

comes as an anti-climax. Rath-
er than a “critical commentary
on higher education” one finds
an irrational diatribe filled with

sweeping
platitudes.

AND So PENCIL-PAL,

T MST CLOSE NOW,
AS EVER.
CHARLIE BROWN

Mr. Williams’ scattered at-
tempts at reasoned argument
arc based on two rather shaky
assumptions: first, that the col-
leges should attempt to educate
nearly everybody (“at least four
fifths of all the nation’s chil-
dren"); and second, that the de-
ficiences of individual profes-
sors are responsible for prac-
tically all of the shortcomings
of American higher education.

The first of these assump-
tions is supported by some
rather curious beliefs; for exam-
ple, he states that “if it is true
that virtually all the children
of wealthy parents go to col-
lege, we may assume that, in a
nation in which all parents were
prosperous, virtually all chil-
dren would be college materi-
al.” Mr. Williams’ reasoning
rarcly rises above this level.

WHIPPING BOY

The second assumption pro-
over-generalizations, vides him with a whipping boy

likes about today’s colleges. For

example, we learn that “the pro-
fessor’s personality results from
some quite fearful pressures
and tensions that have warped,
suppressed, or misdirected
many an element of character,
and made the typical professor
at last a quite abnormal person-
ality,” who is “underlain with a
deep sense of. inferiority, fear,
and maladjustment, yet over-
lain by an almost frantic sense
of superiority.”
NOT BAD MEN

He does concede a certain
residue of humanity to the
teaching profession (“the ma-
jority of professors are, not
actually bad men; they do not
want to do evil"), but ultimate-
ly they do not have “as much
morality as elephants, cattle,
and baboons,” and “the only
way they could be more im-
moral would be to commit mur-
der.”

All in all, Mr. Williams’ mani-
festo has a certain amusement
value, but it cannot be taken
seriously.

Sad Story Of The °
i

‘Shaft - And Sorrow
I was coming back from the Post Office, struggling

By TOM KERNAN
to make a little headway against. the gale sweeping across
the Davidson Tundra. when I encountered my young
friend, Harry Ferlips. His adolescent countenance bore
the look of a man who has just finished reading Crime and
Punishment.

“Bombed.” he said “Blitzed, smashed, ruined—”

“Trouble?” 1 asked intelligently.

“Shafted! Two days till our fraternity function; Kip-
ling was right, all women are—” (a blast of wind drowned
out his last few words.)

“That’s too bad, Harry,” I said. “It’s a pity you never
knew Good Old Chaflie Hartug; there was a man who real-
ly knew women! He was almost a legend before he grad-
uated. Charlie used to say that being successful with wo-
men hinged on the employment of two basic techniques.

The first he named “Hartug’s Little Boy Lost.” Half
of the women you meet, said Charlie, want to mother
you; they feel the urge to take your tousled head in their
hands and wipe away the tears. I know for a fact that
Charlie was going steady with three girls at the same
time, each of whom thought that she was the only thing
keeping him from jumping off Chambers some dark night.
Of course, he always did tend to over-do things. He used
to pull that stunt about being just a forgetful kid; you
know, couldn’t keep his clothes straight, things like that..
Well, he even went to a dance one time without his shoes
and socks — just his bare feet, being very careful not to
cut his toenails either. Made a tremendous impression;
touch of genius in that boy.”

“The other technique he called “Hartug’s Be a Heel,”
or “The Blonde Brute.” The rest of the women you meet,
said Charlie, have a desire to be punished; the meaner
you are to them, the more they like it. There was a rumor
around here that Charlie saved as many as seven dif-
ferent girls from the psycho-ward. He dished out so much
punishment that each of them was cured of a case of ex-
treme guilt complex. He had a lot of minor troubles, too:
told me most of them, and they’ve really helped me.

it.”

“I thought you were going to the function.”

“Shaft,” I muttered softly, pulling a crumpled letter
out of my pocket. ,

THE PHILOSOPHES

Seen From A Bus...

By DABNEY STUART

On either side of the narrow
macadam road the flat, low,
grassy farmland of the Nether-
erlands stretched out into the
morning sun. Interspersed
canals intruded their fingers in-
to the coastline, bearing sun-
light in their currents like dia-
monds scattered from a_peas-
ant’s wheclbarrow.

Occasionally one could see
protruding from the long reed-
ed canal banks a fishing pole
of plain wood, and, as the bus
sped by. a round dark-blue cap
would betray the presence of
the fisherman.

But there were appear-
ances in this bright Dutch
morning to mar the pastoral
placidity. At regular inter-
vals concrete pillboxes rose
out of the banks like smooth
rocks raising their humped,
rounded backs out of the sea.
The sond-colored domes, con-
nected by a labyrinth of un-
derground passages, dotted
the sides of the canals with
silent reminders of days that
are not foo long past to be
forgotten.

The bus slows as it approach-
es a small village whose clust-
ered buildings form a U around
the end of a fingernail of one of
the probing canals. Two men

dressed in dirty white coveralls
pause in their painting of a
small store and look as the pon-
derous vehicle passes them by.
Their looks are not of welcome.

At the center of the village,
by a little monument, the bus
draws to ,a halt, its motor
idling. (One learns that ‘it isn't
general practice to stop in these
small villages for very long.)
Around the base of the stone
figure, not much taller than a
grown man, three children are
gathered, playing together in
the morning sun. As the bus
stops, so does their activity, and
they look up at the faces look-
ing down at them. They smile
young smiles.

in the doorway of the yel-
low stone house next to the
monument appears a woman,
calling something to the chil-
dren. Her call is urgent and
@ look of suspicion and fear
masks her blond face. The
children turn reluctantly and
the woman comes to them to
hurry them along inside. She
glances at the bus over her
shoulder as she carries the
littlest one in her arms.

Nearby an old man lays his
Shovel against the side of a
building and watches. His face
and clothes are covered with
dust from the coal he has been
shoveling from the Street to a
truck. His frown is coal-hard be-
neath the dust.

These people are plain peo-
ple. They live a simple life.
They work hard. They work
everyday and their wheelbar-
rows carry coal. There is much
to learn from these people.
