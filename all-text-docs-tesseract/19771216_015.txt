~ Davidson athletics:a reflection

It is common for a senator
or president, when his time of
service comes to an end, to
recall events and give his
opinion.of what i is to come.

Although. only self-elected,
I, too, wotild like to make
some comments, not on polit-
ical happenings, but on some-
thing eloser to home - Da-
vidson athletics.

‘When I first strayed from
the banks of the muddy Mis-
sissippi in September, 1973, I
did not know what to expect

from Davidson except football .

teams that passed almost. e-
very down, but seldom won,
and basketball teams famous
for their success.

Things changed.

Having come from a part of
the country where football is
the king of college sports, it
was a new experience to come
to a place where football’s role
was limited to being some-
thing one put up with until the
start’ of basketball season.

The team in 1973 was like
the others Dave Fagg had
coached - few victories and
lots of passes. But that year
was more important to the
future of Davidson football
than the past had been, be-
cause of a decision by the
trustee.

While the Wildcats were in
Colorado to face the Air Force
Academy, it was decided that
Davidson would no longer be
the smallest school playing
major college football, but
would slide down to the more
realistic Division -II level.
The trustees had tried to do
the same thing a decade earlier
to Lefty Dreisell and the
basketball program, but the
Lefthander broke the meeting
up by leading his squad to an
on the road win over Ohio
State, a national power at the
time.

Fagg was ‘not so lucky -
Davidson lost to Air Force.

Fagg left his alma mater
after that decision for a spot at

Transfers and a late start

' But the Wildcats need to

_ are meaningless. when one

With so:

Still, several raat in the .

line- -up remain, and if Pritc-

- with new players this year, it

could ‘very well be happy days

- again, .

But the coaching staff is.
going to have to learn what.
qualifications Ed White ex-
pects from recruits, work with
him, and realize that it is
useless to waste time on
players like Zam Frederick,

now at South Carolina after.

signing with Davidson but ‘not
getting accepted.

The conflicts between the
athletic department and the
administration are unnecess-

_ary.

The future success of minor
sports at Davidson is limited

‘by. having non-scholarship pr-
_ograms. I am not saying that

scholarships should be given,
but it should be realized that
dominance in the conference
cannot be expected.

. Good, hard-working coac-
hes, which Davidson has now,
will be able to field competi-
tive teams and achieve some

“success, but,.for example, the »

days of annual conference
tennis championships. are-Ov- |
er.

Occasionally, a i. tern |

_in a minor sport: will arise, but |

on the whole, the. value of
third and fourth. place confer-

_ ence finishes’ against scholar-

ship programs. ‘should be 8p:

‘ preciated.

Davidson has - finally, reac-

hed a point where the years of

rebuilding might always. say- -
ing wait until year will be able
to point proudly to the season
at hand. .

I hope- I'm right.
