QUOTABLE
QUOTES

(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“E know of no way in which a
semi-ready preparedness can be de-
veloped with less militarizing effect
than when it is mixed with all the
forces of a.curriculum on a univer-
sity campus.” The University. of
Rochester's Chancellor C. W. Flint
makes hié¢ defense of the R. O. T.
C. system,

“No patriotic teacher should ob-
ject to taking the oath of allegiance.
It is an honor, not a reflection, upon
her character. Tt does not carry
with it interference with the right
of educators to determine the
courses of study. Courses of study
will be safe in the hands of loyal
teachers...” But the D. A. R.’s
Mrs. William Becker forgets that
those who promote the oath also
promote interference with studies.

into the brakeman’s eye;" and
“trains so fast they. reached the
station before the whistle sounded
there.”

Quaint proverbs and epigrams
kept the atidience chuckling for
the next few minutes. Some of the
more unique statements were these:
“AN T knowl hear: all I know I
tread in newspapers: all I know
you can put in a thimble; all T
know 1 keep forgetting :” “He that
makes himself an ass men will
ride;” “When pups bark. old dogs
go on doing whatever they were
doing.”

To close, Sandburg chanted a few
folksongs to the accompaniment of
his guitar, just “to take the high-
brow curse off the evening.” In
concluding, he said. “Your faces
have been kind-to me. I thank
you.” ~

Whatever may be said of Sand-
burg’s poetry, his own oral inter-
pretation of it is a powerful argu-
ment in its favor, it was the opin-
ion of a large part of his audience

As Kernel writes this week's
chore. the identity of our new
columnist is still a mystery. For the
benefit of the freshmen (if any)
who can read, it might be well to
state here that Nozy Broom is not
his real name; in fact, you might
even say it’s fictitious, or phony.
Kernel has an inkling, however, and
he passes it on to you. He has
very good reason to believe that
the perpetrator of this column is
(now don't say Kernel told you)
Walter Winchell. Therefore Ker-
net has put adhesive tape over his
key-hole. Go thou and do like-
wise.

—o—

The one just past has been by
far the biggest week-end this cam-
pus has seen since the last Bowery
Brawl. What a pep meeting! What
a game! What a dance! What a
headache!! But let’s take ‘em one
at a time: :

What Kernel would like’to know
is, Why do they call it a shirt-tail
parade? There were a good many
of the latter in evidence, but -not
many shirts. This business of grab-

‘| bing belts instead is no doubt less

destructive, but what Kernel would
like to do is hear some good healthy
rips as the line rounds corners. One
poor freshman wore his own belt;
now he’s using safety pins. Only
an army belt can really take it.
Kernel can hardly wait until home-
coming. As the parade winds
around the fire the belts are like-
ly to be in different hands. What
a tail that will make!

—-o—
When the
speak, the
éntire chapel audience was silent
until he had finished.

—o—

The game next day was great, but
Kernel was disappointed in one
thing: he didn't learn how to pro-
nounce the name of this fellow
Traqkgl. or whatever it is, who
tried to pull the Cats whiskers-for

Correct this sentence:
cheerleader got up to

awhile. Everybody said it differ-
ently. Suggestion: Why doesn't

the band play “The Man on the
Flying Trapeze” while those stooges
are leading yells?

—o—

Now we come to the dance, just
as everybody did come to it Sat-
urday night. By great puffing and
blowing, the orchestra managed to
do pretty well, but they really
weren't necded. Every girl Ker-
nel danced with, except one, sang
in his ear the whole time. The ex-
ception whistled.

-—-Oo—

Kernel is for an addition to the
Pan-Hellenic rules that would pre-”
vent more than one girl from wear-
ing a dress of a certain color. It’s
mighty embarrassing to dance with
the wrong green dress. And that’s
about the only way to recognize
these girls you meet at the rate of
about ten per minute. But the
girls can’t tell the boys apart eith-
er, so what's the difference? Ker-
nel just danced with 'em all, intro-
duction or no introd. .

—o—

Something Kernel forgot to say
is that he’s all for this idea of spon-
sors for the_ball. games. The stu-
dent body was warned at chapel
Saturday against amusing itself by
throwing pop bottles and kisses at
these comely lasses, so there was
a good bit of restraint in the stands
that afternoon. Still, we could all
look, and that was something. Ker-
nel’s going to take some field
glasses next time. Maybe he'll
watch the game a little, too.

i —o— «.

When Kernel gets to this part
of the column each week, his brain
runs as dry as a Davidson football
game, and those last ten lines just
won't come out. Next week he can’t
use this method to fill them ‘out.
Don’t know what he'll do then.
But it’s all done now, so he'll close
the typewriter for a week.

li she isn’t offered a job and with
it the opportunity to pass the final
test, she has to be content with say-
ing: “Heck, I didn’t want the darn
old thing anyhow.” Ja, so geht’s.
