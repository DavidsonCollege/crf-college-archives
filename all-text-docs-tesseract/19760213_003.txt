Da vidson blacks blast college, town

By MARK WILENSKY
' Staff Writer

At a community meeting held last
Thursday night, Town of Davidson
blacks verbally blasted the Town
Council and Davidson College.

While airing grievances to Legal
Aid Society of Mecklenburg County
Attorneys, about 40 members of the
town’s black minority depicted Town,
Council’s decision-making process as
dominated by Davidson college.

The meeting was called by Mrs.
Annie Mildred Lowery, to give town
residents an opportunity to discuss
their problems with the Farmer’s
Home Administration, with the Legal
Aid Attorneys.

Legal Aid Director Terry Roche,
Attorney Don Gillespie and Para
Legal Arthur Griffin all attended the
session held at the Ada Jenkins
Community Center.

Roche began the meeting by asking
those present if they had any quest-
ions or problems they would like to
discuss. Immediately the question of
a proposed Algae Pond Park became
the chief topic of the meeting.

“What about the-people on Sloan
Street?’’’ one elderly gentleman
asked. ‘‘Will they have to move to
build this here park?”’

Algae Pond

It was explained that the Town of
Davidson had plans to build a park in
the area known as Algae Pond.

The Pond is that body of water on
the right side of the road as one enters
Davidson from I-77 began Griffith
Street.

The town has received federal

Union investigationto begin,
committee sets procedures

funding for site improvement on the
land. Town residents explained the
park was to be built beginning in the
spring of 1976.

According to those attending the
meeting, the town plans to acquire
Sloan Street (a residential street of
four homes) as spi of the overall park
plan.

““According to Nancy MacCor-
mac,’’ said a member of the Town
Park and Recreation Committee,
“Sloan Street will not be taken yet. It
is part of a long range plan, and
nobody will be forced to move until
other places are available.

“I’ve been told that they are
already rezoning Sloan Street and
Griffith. We’re all gonna have to get
out,” another woman replied.

Legal right

Roche interrupted to explain briefly
that a municipality has the legal right
to obtain any land from its owner for
public use by paying fair market
value for it.

He explained that ultimately the
owner of. land desired by a munici-
parity for public use could be made to
sell.

Roche suggested it might be possi-
ble to _ persuade the town to change its
plans if the community was ‘t
against the park.

There was a clear consensus against
negotiating with the Town Council.
One lady explained that appealing to
the town was futile, suggesting that
Town Council was not interested in
the black community.

“Look,”’.a' man said, “everybody
knows that this town is run by
Davidson College. Nothing else mat-

ters bi what the college says.”’
Others in the audience agreed.

‘‘Davidson College runs the town

all right,’’ a woman added. Roche

inquired as to the makup of the Town —

Council and was told it was made up
of one college administration (Grover
Meetze), a retired professor (J.W.
Reid), a faculty wife (Nancy Mac-
Cormac) along with two non-college
related members (Bill Mayhew, and
Burl Narramore).

“The reason that the park is being
built is because the college wants to
make its entrances look better. Let
them build it somewhere else. 7 hese
people have nowhere to go. They
worked hard for their land,” a
resident said.

““Davidson College owns all the
land anyway. They keep buying
everything up and always say they
can’t sell because they need to hold it
for their people. Let them build their
park by the Interstate. That lot is
empty,” he continued.

Motel site

For some years the college has
owned a large land tract near the
Interstate with hopes of selling it as a
motel site. At present the site remains
unsold.

Town resident Ron Donalson took
the floor and read an open letter to
Davidson residents from their peers,
urging residents to think carefuly
before selling their land.

“Let these people build some place
else,’’ he said. ‘‘Why ‘not at the
entrance of I-77 into Davidson; the
property Davidson College has
bought, just as they are still buying
all around us.’

“For years we couldn’t get the town
of Davidson to keep up the land by
Algae Pond.: We asked them to mow
the lawn and they never did. I finally
borrowed Mrs. White’s mower and
mowed it myself,’’ said Donaldson.

“Now that we got all the weeds out
they want it, just when we got it
looking all right,’’ continued Donald-
son.

-‘In the past two years they still
only been out to mow the grass four
times.”’

College runs town

“We all know that Davidson college
runs this town,” interrrupted a man
in the front; ‘‘What Davidson college
wants, Davidson College gets. David-
son College runs.the Town Council,’
he concluded.

It was decided that Legal Aid
would investigate exactly what the
plans for the park were, and whether
or not the town of Davidson had were
officially adopted them.

The residents were told that there
may well be legal ways to insure that
the residents of the area have an
opportunity to protect their interests

After the discussion of Algae Pond
Park, The Farmer’s Home Admi-
istration (FHA) rent collection pro-
cedures in Lakeside were discussed.

Residents claimed that Farmers
Home was confusing residents as to
payment procedures, and many resi-
dents felt the FHA collection was not
entirely clear.

Roche explained that alee could
be done without the lawyers having a
chance to review the FHA contracts.

Arthur Griffen arranged with indi-
vidual residents .to meet- with them
and review their problems with FHA.

Union President Karl Good-
house has appointed a Com-
mittee on Finance and told it
to unravel the Union’s budget
problems.

Committee chairman Brad
Swalwell said his. group will
have two goals. ‘First, we will
audit the Union’s books to
locate any discrepancies such
as unrecorded expenditures or
receipts.

Then, we will try to develop
a system that the Union can
use to keep its books in good
order in the future.”’

The Union received: $49,000
this school year from the
Students’ Activities Fee. This
sum is depositied in a single
account. The Comptroller’s
office handles all voucher re-
quests and receipts from the
Union and insures that the
account remains balanced.

The Union Board deter-
mines how the money. will be
allocated between its eight
social committees and ten
co-curricular committees. In
addition the vice-presidents of
the social and co-curricular
committees and the union
president are allocated contin-
gency funds to cover unex-

pected cost overrruns in their
departments.

Each committee is instrict-
ed to stay within its budget,
and the Board attempts to
monitor expenditures by
maintaining ledgers for each

Goodhouse

committee.

Swalwell cited an example
to explain the problem. “‘The
pop film is shown on Friday
night and $100 in gate fees are
collected. That money is taken

. in a bag to the comptroller’s

office with an attached note
that it is to be deposited in the
Union’s account.

“The money is credited to
the account, and the Board
gets a receipt'on the transfer.
However, if the receipt does
not say who made the deposit,
the board doesn’t know which
committee to credit it to.

Auditing the Union’s books
is ‘a two-step process, accord-
ing to Swalwell. ‘We will look
at each committee’s ledger

card and determine total mo-
ney spent and total re-

maining,” he said.

“Those figures will be total-
ed and compared the comp-
troller’s figure for the Union
account., Next, we will see if all
receipts have been properly
credited. This will insure that
no committee is credited with
expenditures it never made.

“After the present financial
status of the Union has been
determined, we’ll devise a
system to keep Union finances
straight,’ said Swalwell.

‘Presently, the Campus
Tax Board receives the other
half of the Students’ Activities
Fee. Each of its committees
has its own account and
budget. If the Union operated
under that setup, committee
expenditures might be much
easier to monitor.

“Or perhaps the committees
can required to adhere to strict
accounting procedures. Car-
bons of receipts and vouchers
involving funds from’ the
Union account could be made.

. Then the Board would have a

record of each committee’s
spendings.”’
