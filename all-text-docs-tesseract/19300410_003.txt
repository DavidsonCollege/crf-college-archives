Side Line Shots

At Wildcat Victories Over

: Strong Opponents
By P. R. Alderman

The Diamond and Track teams took ad-
vantage of the holidays to chalk up a
string of victories in’ spite of being on
foreign territory all the time.

That loss to Wake Forest surely
was an unexpected set-back for the
baseball squad after two welcome
wins over Elon and State. It was the
first time a nine from Elon had been
defeated by the 'Cats in many a moon.

There was somewhat of a tendency to
credit the first win over the Wolfpack to
Dame Luck, but this atitude didn’t last
any longer than the second clash with
State when Captain Kugler and his mates
were in great form to turn the visitors
back by the decisive score of 8 to 2.

Two South Carolina track teams
were able to furnish very little com-
Petition to the fast-stepping Wildcat
squad. Captain Heath Whittle, David-
son’s fleet dashman, is rapidly gaining
nation-wide recognition, his most bril-
liant performance taking place a
couple of weeks ago when he gave
Sol Furth, national champ, a close run
for his title.

Joe McCall is still turning in points for
the ’Cats by taking honors in the broad
jump against all opposition. He broke the
school record against the Gamecocks at
Columbia,

The Fresh nine started off the sea-
son like they really meant business.
When a team piles up over 20 runs
in one game it’s a pretty good indica-
tion that they’re going to be hard to
beat. Keep it up Kittens!

Unless the tide turns the outlook is ex-
ceptionally bright for the Wildcats both
on the Diamond and Track asewell. The
latter have no defeats as yet while the
former have lost three contests against
five wins.

“Sleepy” Goodson, stellar second-
sacker, has turned out again to be a
tough proposition for any pitcher. His
three doubles in the second State
clash had a lot to do with chalking up
such an overwhelming victory.

“Doc” Kugler, after getting off to a
bad start against the Georgetown squad,
settled down to accomplish the difficult
task of twirling against the same team
twice in sucecssion. That he did this well
is quite obvious.

“Red” Parrish and John McGinnis
continue to sock the old apple far
away at least once during a game.
Judging from past performances it
looks like the ’Cats are going to be
pretty hard to hold to a low score
very often.

Nab Armfield is still playing his usual
consistent game behind the plate, besides
showing marked improvement over his
last year’s hitting to turn in the high
average of .307.

It sems that we're expecting a little
too much of the ’Cats, especially at
the baseball games. They’ve been
playing great ball in spite of the fact
that comparatively few students at-
tend the game, many arriving late and
leaving before the contest is over.
There are some hard games.ahead so
let’s be out! there 100 per cent to show
that we're right behind them. They
deserve it and will appreciate it.

Wildcat Nine Divides Two
Game Series With State

’Cats Easy Winners in First Game
But Drop Second at Concord 6-4

The Wildcats divided a double bill with
the N. C. State Wolfpack, Friday and
Saturday, the first played on the home
field and the second on neutral territory,
Concord,

Davidson was complete master of the
first contest, winning in easy fashion, 8-2.
A disastrous sixth inning in which the
Techmen made five errors and the Wild-
cats the same number of hits gave the
Wildcats and an easy victory.
Captain Kugler pitched tine ball, only al-
lowing eight scattered hits and fanning
seven men. Bill Goodson, stellar second-

six runs

sacker for the ‘Cats, hit three doubles in
the afternoon and led both teams in the
batting averages for the day. Turner and
Gerock were best for State each garner-
ing two hits out of four attempts.

N. C. State, however, showed a com-
plete reversal of form at Concord the fol-
lowing afternon, and sent the Davidson
boys back on the small end of a 6-4 count.
Captain Shore did good work on the
mound for the Wolfpack, allowing but
five hits. McInnis allowed nine hits to the
Techmen and was the only man on cither
team to get an extra base hit

Three State men, Brake, Snipes, and
Furtado, were successful in base stealing
attempts, while Miller of Davidson was
the only Wildcat to pilfer a bag.

McInnis and Shore both struck
three men. The State fielders remained
errorless for the day while Parrish and
Covington cach committed one error.
