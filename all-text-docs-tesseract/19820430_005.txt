Faculty to Vote on EPC Grade Proposal

Student opinion has been strong and
varied concerning the Educational Poli-
cies Committee’s “proposed new
4—point grading scale, which the facul-
ty wilf vote on this Monday. ~

“Davidson students spend more than
enough ‘time thinking about grades.
Why spend any more time thinking
about something that doesn’t make any
diffetence?” Asked sénior John Hart-
man: ae
- ‘Many students fear that the reporting
of course grades as numbers between
0.0 and 4.0 would increase competition
and grade—conciousness by multipy-
ing the number of possible grades. In-
stead of letters (A, B plus, B, etc.), one
could receive a 3.7 or a 2.9, for exam-
ple.

“This is just going to make people
more wrapped up in their grades,”
freshman Mike Tantillo warned. So-
phomore Sally Hughes reflected, “The
fewer divisions the better.”

Not everyone is opposed to the
change, however; some students see the
finer distinctions between grades as an
advantage. As sophomore, Mike Blake
explained, with numerical grades “it’s a
little easter to bring up a low GPA.”
Another sophomore, Charles Wiley
predicted, “It could increase competi-
tion, but I don’t think it will.”

Others think numerical grades are
more fair than letter grades but would
rather not change systems. midstream.
Junior Dean Withrow suggested that the
class of ’86 be graded on the proposed
scale while those of us here now con-
tinue using the letter grade scale. “I
guess I’m just used to it,” sophomore

_ Andy Leeper said.

Psychology Professor John Kelton,
who devised the EPC’s plan, denies that
replacing letters with numbers could ag-
gravate “grade—grubbing.” Because
the proposed scale would eliminate the
1.0 point difference between a high D
and a low C, for instance, he maintains
that it would have “just the opposite” ef-
fect. .

The difference between a 1.7 and a
2.0 is less sevére than between a 1.0 and
a 2.0. Although he considers the plan “‘a

_ very fair and adequate. way” of allowing

professors more flexible grading, Pro-
fessor Kelton says the confusion in so
many students’ minds is understanda-
ble. “They’re not sure what it means. I
don’t blame people for that.”

The possibility. of a new grading scale

has caused a number of students to ques-

tion-the importance of grades to educa-
tion, When asked “What would happen
if we had no grades at all?” most people
laughed and said. “Nobody. would
study.” John Hartman was more specif-
ic:“People who wanted to study. would.
People who didn’t wouldn’t.””
Freshman Wilson Lowrey agreed:
““You’d have to take another type of stu-
dent into Davidson College if you did

that. It wouldn’t work with this group of |

students.” Mike Tantillo felt that it
might be wise to report all freshmen’s
grades as Pass or Fail as some other
rather competitive schools do, but he
called abolishing all grqades “too much
of an extreme.”

Tim Whalen, a senior, felt that,“Any
grading system can be fair if the person
administering it is. fair.” The EPC’s

aan
aN

proposal will come into effect in the fall
if the faculty votes to accept it in Mon-
day’s meeting, the last of the year. Talk

gestions or questions before they make
their decision.

ing approved” because both parties (the
college and the town) agreed by consen-
sus that it is a “reasonable ordinance.”

‘She .anounced that objections to the
ordinance should be brought up at the
7:30 p.m. open town meeting. “If con-
cerns show us that we need to re—study
the ordinance, we will not pass it,”
MacCormac said.

The noise ordinance would restrict off
caqqmpus parties more than on campus
parties, says Ford, because their noise
readings would be taken closer to the
source. | :

Ford says the Davidson police have

- been taking noise’ level readings since

mid—March. They measured the 900
Room's output at 60 db from Concord
Toad and Patterson Court parties below
70 db fromthe edge of campus. A Fiji

band party registered 80 db at the prop-
erty line, however. The Davidson, po-
lice also measured the noise level inside
the party at 100 db, says Fod.

“T think it’s too bad that it (the noisy
controversy) had to come down to an or-
dinance,” said Fiji President David Sho-
emaker. “We will try to be more careful
and work within it as well as possible.”

SPE President Frank Clark does not
foresee any problems with the ordi-
nance. “I don’t see how it will affect our
fraternity. muchg at all,” says Clark.

- “But I do think it will give the town-

speople a little peace of mind,” he

The SPE’s have been working to have
“better relations with the community
ever since their Chairmen of the Board
party triggered objections from neigh-

bors. After the loud party thirty local
residents signed and submitted a peti-
tion calling for noise regulation. At first
the town chose to turn the matter over to
the college, but then decided to inter-
fere.

The Police Committee recommended
that Davidson adopt a noisé ordinance.
The town formed the Noise Study Com-
mittee to draft a proposal. The commiit-
tee includes student representative Joe
Ford, Dean of Students Will Terry, two
members of the Town Board, two
members of the Police Committee, and
two Davidson citizens. The Committee
has also invited Shoemaker and Clark to
attend their last three meetings.
