Cunt. Coochie-snorter. Vagina. These are
not words heard in the daily conversations at
Davidson. But on February 16, 18, and 19 the
sound of vaginas did not only underlie the
hum of small talk, but it resounded from the
walls. of Love Auditorium.

This buzz was the result of the Vagina
Monologues, a play by Eve Ensler. The
Vagina Monologues, directed by sophomore
Bill Neville, were performed at Davidson as
part of a 2001 College Initiative.

Nearly 250 colleges and universities across

Laura Waddle ‘01

the world participated in this effort to spread
the Monologues and their message. They
were also performed this year in Madison
Square Garden in New York City on Febru-
ary 10, where 18,000 women attended to hear
the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Glenn Close
perform.

Here at Davidson they were performed by
a different cast each night, fifteen to eighteen
women, staff and students, dressed in black

’ with red boas, bringing their stories, energy,

and compassion to each piece that was read.

The Vagina Monologues are the visible,
marketable sign of a greater movement called
V-Day. V-Day is technically Valentine’s
Day, but the fourteenth of February simply
serves as a marker around which all the
energy of the movement can be focused.

It is a movement to stop rape, childhood
sexual abuse, battery, and genital mutilation
against women. It isamovement to celebrate
women’s bodies, to
talk about them in full
voice and enriching
terms. It is a move-
ment to recognize all
the varied experi-
ences women have
within themselves
and with the world.

V-Day demands
the opportunity for
safe and creative
growth, not shame
and recovery. It
raises ‘money for lo-
cal organizations
working to stop
sexual violence
against women. It
raises awareness, the
catalyst by which
change can start.

Bill Neville
brought the mono-
logues to Davidson
this year after work-
ing at the New York
Stage and Film’s
summer residency
program at Vassar
College. He was as-
‘sistant director for
three plays directed
by Michael Greif (of
RENT fame). While
he was there he met
and got to see Eve

Christina Pike

Ensler at work as she
workshopped her
newest play Necessary
Objects.

For Neville, the play
provided a “construc-
tive, unintimidating
way to shed light on
the violence against
women.” It was a
way tounite the David-
son community for the
safety of women here,
but to also be part of a
national effort that de-
pends upon each indi-
vidual school. The V-
Day College Initiative
is headed up by Karen
Oble, who took
Ensler’s V-Day brain-
child and saw it as a
powerful mission at a
collegiate level.

’ This idea of unity is
present throughout the
production. There
were three different
casts for three differ-
ent nights so that in-
clusion was empha-
sized. This way many
people could contrib-
ute, and at whatever
level they were com-
fortable; be it saying

one line to performing a whole piece. Neville’s

purpose was not a “well-crafted theatrical
production” but rather instigating a force and
awareness.

This integrating vision of the Monologues
was reflected the composition. There were
monologues that covered many spectrums,
including age, race, and sexual orientation.
They addressed coming of age, pleasure, and
violence. They were diverse so that people of
all types could relate, and the message would
be that much more personal.

Neville and many others hope that V-Day

will be an annual tradition at Davidson. The
performers this year reveled in their experi-
ence, and more than one audience member
left feeling proud of her vagina. There were
400 to 900 people at the shows each night,
and that was only at our one college.

As the director’s notes in the program state,
“The dream of a world without violence has
survived, endured, and become an unstop-
pable driving force throughout the world. . .
. This is only the beginning. . . . The world is
changing.” :

nights to raise money for local efforts to stop violence against
