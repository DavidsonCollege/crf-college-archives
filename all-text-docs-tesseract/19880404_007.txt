Ford excels as Frantic doctor but Quaid and Fuller are DOA

By BRUCE PLOURDE
I know what you’re think-
ing. “Oh great! Another

Harrison Ford movie. Just

what I and the entire civi-
lized world have been wait-
ing for.” Harrison Ford,
like many other actors, has
lost the initial freshness and
charm which made his roles
in Star Wars and Witness
stand out in sublimity. His
gestyres, in the main, have
become hackneyed; that
sarcastic curling of the right
half of his lip, for instance,
and that faraway, Thoreau-
vian look of quiet
desperation.Frantic,Ford’s
latest film, gives him a
chance to re-enact all his fa-
vorite poses and facial con-
tortions which, having
Jaunched, seem now to be
giving berth, to his career.

But Frantic offers more
than Harrison Ford’s tried
and trite ability. The direc-
tor, Roman Polanski, has
given Ford achance.to play
a character who is by and
large an average American
put into an explosive situ-
ation. Although at first the
audience must deal with the
burden of Ford’s past as a
portrayer of hero types, the
plausibility of his role im-
proves as the tale pro-
gresses.

Ford plays a surgeon, Dr.
Walker, who travels to Paris
with his wife Sondra (Betty
Buckley) to read a paper
before a medical conven-
tion and, in the meantime,
enjoy the possiblities of-
fered by the City of Lights.
When Sondra seeks to
change herclothes she finds
she cannot open her suit-
case, and they soo discover
that she has taken someone
else’s. Dr. Walker calls the
airport to rectify their mis-
take, and then takes a
shower in an attempt to
shake off his jet lag. While
in the shower his wife re-
ceives a phone call and
steps—out—of the--room:
Walker prepares for their
meal in bed while awaiting
her retum.

But she never returns, and
thus begins Walker’s odys-
sey to find his wife. Myste-
rious occurrences lead him
on a trail of intrigue and
violence. His path leads
him to all the places tourists
miss, for some reason or
other. He encounters all
sorts of colorful characters
from the underground of
Paris. In particular, he takes
special pains to introduce
himself to Michelle (Em-
manuel Seigner), the sweet
little French girl whose suit-
case bears a marked resem-
blance to his wife’s.

In all honesty those ad-
jectives don’t properly fit
Michelle. Yes, she is petite,
but douce, non, pas du tout.
This girl represents her
country well in that she is

‘ beautiful, amoral and ego-

tistic. She would fit well
into the silhouette of a brick
outhouse. One would ex-
pect that, like in Fatal
Attraction, such a sensuous
woman would entice the
husband to‘temptation. But
Walker remains resolutely
loyal to his wife, haggard as
she looks, arid becomes at-
tached to Michelle only so
far as she can help him bring
his lady to liberty.

Polanski has done his
homework well, and suc-
ceeds in approximating
Alfred Hitchcock’s style.
The very title, Frantic,
suggests something Hitch-
cockian, akin to Psycho,
Frenzy and Vertigo. Polan-
ski, like Hitchcock, has to-
tal control of the set and the
perspective.

He also reveals the story
as that rotund master of
mystery might. Although
one does not consider mur-
der mystery the genre of

Polanski, here he succeeds -

in flattering another great
director by imitation.

Also, in the Hitckcock
connection, whereas one
film critic has called Harri-
son Ford the new
Humphrey Bogart, I would
suggest that Polanski has
made him the new James
Stewart.

The film’s only short-
coming resembles Michael
Douglas’ character prob-
lems in Fatal Attraction,
i.e., Walker’s unswerving
fidelity tohis wife. Michael
Douglas has no reason for
the liaison between himself
and Glenn Close because he
is married to a very lovely

and sensuous woman. By .

indulging in his weekend
fling, he denies himself the
audience’s sympathy and
affection. Having just seen
such a film, the audience
might very well anticipate
such an encounter to occur
between the gaunt, hand-
some Walkerand thesultry,
erotic- Michelle. But -it
never happens. Part of
Walker’s strength is his ad-
herence to old ideals while
all around him languish in
corruption and vice. De-
spite the beauty and will-
ingness of his young ac-
quaintance, the good doctor
remains steadfastly loyal to
his dear, albeit homely,
wife of twenty years.
Polanski deserves a big

‘bravo for bringing such tal-

ent to sucha good project as
Frantic. I give him an unre-
served “A” for his study of
an American in Paris.

DOA stars Dennis Quaid
as‘a college English profes-
sor in an out-of-whack
“publish or perish” di-
lemma that would surely
put Dr. Engellathisease. A
string of murders occurs,
involving one of his bright-
est students, his wife, and
himself. He must find his

murderer in the twenty-four
hours before his impending
death, which, in the movie,
seems to drag through that

entire twenty-four hours. .

Some tension arises in the
fight scenes, during which
Dexter Comell (Quaid),
who has felt dead for the
past four years but now, on
the edge of death, feels reju-
venated, has to confront
murderers such as the very
butch butler Bernard or the
invisible nail-shooting
maniac. But, incomparison
to Frantic, this movie,
through its dragged-out ex-
plorations of potential solu-
tions, offers very little in the
way of suspense.

But wait: there is another
Star in the movie. Meg

Ryan plays Sydney Fuller,a
college freshman with an
ivy-league crush on her

favorite professor.

Sydney Fuller is more
than just the love interest in
the story, though: she is the
archetypal coed, the quin-
tessence of college life, a
role model for freshmen
girls everywhere. What
more could a college girl
ask out of life than blonde
hair, a cute body, an inno-
cent face and acomplete set
of hormones? The dumb
blonde of yore has not gone
the way of the dinosaurs,
she has only changed her lo-
cale from gin joints to cam-
pus dormitories.

Before he is poisoned
Sydney thinks of Professor
Cornellas anice guy, some-
body with whom she would
like to share free love. But
even in his drunken state
she can’t convince him that
what he needs is some good

Downtown

MON.-THURS.
9-5

All programs include 16 semester-hour

rough premarital sex.
After he is- poisoned,
however, they become in-
separable. She can’t keep
up. with him, and so tells
him as much as “Thanks for
the date” but “Drop dead.”
Full well knowing that he
will die within hours, she
can’t bear to be with him.
So they part company, and,
to console herself, she puts
on a new dress and goes to
the Christmas festival.
Fortunately, Davidson
girls are not like this girl at
all. They break the stere-
otypical mold. Every girl
who is in the Pre-Wed pro-
gram knows, after all, that

all that premarital stuff is a
no-no. They don’t need to
give their bodily pleasures
40 suitors, after all, because
they have more than a modi-
cum of grace, charm and,
most of all, sincerity. In
other words, Davidson girls
are like frozen yogurt: cul-
tured and frigid.

So Davidson girls might
get a kick out of seeing the
other side of the street in
DOA. People with amorbid
sense of humor might get a
yuk out of the many death
and ‘dying jokes. For all
others, DOA is just too
played-out and unsuspense-
ful to appreciate.

HEALTH, from page 4

Should it be determined that herpes poses a risk to your
baby, delivery by caesarean section may be recommended.

7. (b) Although theoretically there are other possibilities,
the experts strongly believe that the only way to contract
herpes is through sexual relations with an individual who
has active lesions. Some individuals may not be aware that

‘they have active lesions.

8. (b) Condoms do not offer total protection against either
transmitting or contracting herpes. Men and women with
active lesions should abstain from sexual activity.

9. (e) No one knows exactly what triggers recurrent out-
breaks. But all the factors listed may play a role. Tight
clothing, for example can cause heavy friction and irrita-

tion to the genital area.

In addition, physical conditions such as poor nutrition,
cold or other respiratory infections are associated with
recurrences. In some cases episodes appear to be unrelated

to any trigger event.

10.(b) False. Herpes does not lead directly to any of these
sexually transmitted diseases. However, risk of multiple
infections increases with increasing numbers of sexual

partners.
