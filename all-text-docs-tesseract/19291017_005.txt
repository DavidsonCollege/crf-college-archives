Davidson Alumni Received
Many Thrills During The
West Point Football Game

Alumni Interest of Men Residing
at Many Points in Northern

HAVE VIVID MEMORIES

United Demonstration of Ten Thou-
sand Fans Looms As Outstanding
Thriller

No event happening within recent years
has so served to cement and solidify the
interest of Davidson College alumni up
north as the football game last Saturday
between the U. S. Army and: Davidson
Wildcat elevens at West Point, when sev-
eral hundred former students of the col-
lege residing within three hundred miles
of the military training ground, came to-

and when the game was over, they were
perfectly willing to hoist them on high,
and display to the thousands of fans the
knowledge that they were alumni of this
comparatively unknown North Carolina
college, whose team had so valiantly and
gloriously fought with the eleven of Uncle
Sam,

It is doubtful if ever a group of David-
son alumni were prouder than these sev-
eral hundred men that day. Their loyalty
was evident. in the cheers that rent the
air, and when the game was finally over,
many were unable to speak above a

Davidson College alumni have always
assumed positions of prominence in the
educational world, and one of the most

graduate school of the University of
South Carolina; following the retirement
of Dr. Williams Spencer Currel..

educator, and went to the University of

his Ph.D. degree from the same2 univer-
sity in 1909, to complete his academic
preparation,

He delayed the obtaining of his last
degree by teaching English in the Ala-
bama Presbyterian College, 1905-1907, and
after leaving Harvard Dr. Smith went
immediately as an instructor of English to
the University of Cincinnati, remaining
there one year before accepting a position

Dr. Smith has always been a prominent

EACH

IS A HIGH-SPOT

OF PLEASURE

CAMEL

Camels are either a solitary pleasure g

or a companionable custom

g As you pass

from one activity to the next g or meet one

friend after another g let

Camels mark the

transitions g and lend their cheerful aroma

to each new circumstance g To punctuate

each day with high-spots of

to yourself now and then g

pleasure g say

ll have a Camel!

Camels are mild, mellow and smooth . . . refreshingly cool
. .. an expert blend of the choicest tobaccos grown. That's

why they bring you an extra measure of pleasure . . . why
they never tire your taste, nor leave an unpleasant after-

taste, no matter how often you smoke them.
