The importance of training today
is to meet this increasing need of
leadership,

The kind of man necessary to
fill this need will have to have the
following qualifications: Compre-
hension and understanding; more
creative men; real thinkers; true
statesmanlike men; vision, and un-
erring principles must be present;
foresight is necessary—one must be
wise in time; cooperative leader-
ship; unselfishness; confidence; and
convictions. These qualifications are
the most necessary ones for the
formation of that calibre of leader
that is needed to meet the needs

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

[Continued from Page Two]
FRESHMAN ATTITUDES
Dear Andy:
you noticed the attitude
which the freshman class has taken,
and how it has gone-from_bad_ to
worse, especially since spring holi-

Have

days?
First, there is the matter of speak-
ing to people you meet on the

campus. Not all are guilty, but it
seems that two out of three fresh-
men you pass on the campus go on
by as if they are in another, world.
Then: in chapel they are beginning
to act like a bunch of sophomores.
This not entirely their fault,
since Davidson students in chapel
are the most disrespectful group of
so-called gentlemen we have ever
seen—assembled, but it seems as if
they could see these faults, and be
distinctive acting like gentle-
men,

Of course we realize that quite
a few freshmen were “big shots” in
their high schools, and that others
went to prep school, but we think
it’s high time that they take a turn,
and if they do it, it could only be
for the better, since it would hard-
ly be possible for them to get much
worse.

Hoping with all for a betterment
