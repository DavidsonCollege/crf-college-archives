“A TURNING POINT”?

Furman had the triple misfortune Tuesday night of |

being the first team to play the Wildcats after the St.
Joe game, the first to meet the ’Cats in Johnston Gym,
and of having handed Lefty’s charges their worst defeat
of the season last year. They left Davidson Tuesday
night, fully aware of their misfortunes.

The ‘Cats were great and Hetzel was never better.

“| think we all sort of wanted to redeem ourselves aft-|

er the St. Joe game,” Hetzel noted.
Redeem themselves they did with an offensive show

that managed 50.5 per cent of the field goal attempts, |

72.4 per cent of the free throws, and 113 points, while
out-rebounding the Baptists 62.35.
- Furman managed to hit
47.8% of its shots, which is
pretty good considering that
a majority of the Paladins’
"mad were on outside shots.
rman Coach Lyles Alley
can be thankful that his
team didn’t have a cold
night—the match was hard-
ly a contest as it was, but
if their shooting eye had
failed them, they would
have been run out of the

gym.

Further reflecting on the
game, Hetzel noted that “all
of us were really up for
this one. The fact that Fur-
man beat us last year had a
lot to do with it too, and it
also helped to be playing in
Johnston Gym.”

Hetzel was surely up for
the match. His 53 points, 27
rebounds, 71% field goal
average, and 81% free
throw average were noth-
ing short of phenominal.

B-BALL NOTES

Furman’s thrashing made the ’Cats’ 23rd straight vic-
t in Johnston Gym. ;
es one the nedening of the 1962-63 season, David-
son’s record at Davidson and in Charlotte is 30-2.

record of 25. The performance
is the best individual scoring
effort in college basketball this
season, topping a 52-point out-
burst by Miami's Rick Barry.

Driesell, whose favorite topics
are winning and defense, re-
viewed his feelings by
menting. ‘“‘We won and that’s
what counts.”

When reminded that after a
series of outside shots by Teague
and Marcon with 16:01 to go in
the first period he shouted, |
“Take your time,” Driesell ex-~|
plained that he was ‘‘a little)
concerned” about the missed
shots. }

Final totals showed that Tea- |
gue had 12 points, Davidson, 15 |
Dick Snyder, 13. and Charlie
Marcon had 10 points.

“We were out-shot, out-re-
bounded, out-hustled. and out-
everythinged,” said Driesell of
Saturday night's game against
St. Joseph.

The 77-64 game margin does
not begin to tell the true story
of the game. The ‘Cats led three
times in the first five minutes
at 8-6, 10-6, and 12-6, but the
next seven minutes left them

Before Falling To Duke

By STEVE BROWN

Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson's wrestlers fliatten-
ed Pembroke last Friday by a
score of 31-3, but fell 23-12 to
Duke Monday.

The Pembroke captain. Roger
Barbee, defeated Davidson's
Duff Armfield for the visitors’
only score Friday.

“Lack of depth and lack of a
heavyweight are our two chief
problems at this time.” stated
Coach Charles Parker concern-
ing his matmen.

“Even so," he continued, “I
think we have looked quite good

so far. somewhat better than I
had expected. Wrestling is a
tough sport, and at Davidson
we have always lacked depth
because few boys want to come
out and really work hard if they
are not assured of a position on
the first string.”

Parker cited several of his
charges as showing promise and
skill in contests this year. ‘Joe
Buffington is looking good, and
Mike Bisard. a senior and cap-
tain, and Eric Nichols, a junior,
are both looking fine with their
