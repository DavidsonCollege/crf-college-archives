most exciting plays we’ ve had in
the last few years.”

During the sixteen dates listed
in the ad below, the Davidson ath-
letic department needs students to

‘ move their cars out of the first two

bays of the Baker parking lot. They
must be empty for the athletic de-
partment to meet contractual agree-

ments.
“Baker wants to be a parking
remedy on 349 days of the year,

but on those other 16 days we need .

the student’s help,” game manage-
ment director Lee Sargent said...

Student seating at basketball
games will be different this year,
due to a change in conference

policy.

The first three rows behind
the visitors bench are ear-marked
for visiting team parents, but to
make up for the lost seats, a new
section will be left open for stu-
dents. Students will be asked to
choose whether they want to sit
near our bench or near the visitors’
bench.
