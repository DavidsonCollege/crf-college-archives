“COLLEGE LESSONS
THAT COUNT”

W. Tillett, Jr. of Charlotte,
Shows That ‘Character H lelps a
Man to roti

At the “Y” meeting last Sunday even-

‘ing C. W. Tillett, Jr., of Charlotte, spoke

on the subject, “College Lessons That
Count in a Man’s Life.” He told of those
things which experience in after life
taught him were most worth while in
college. Coming, as he did, a layman,
from a lawyer's position in Charlotte, he
made a strong appeal to every student
present.

“You students, looking out upon life,
are interested in success,” said Mr. Til-
lett. “So am I. I was at first skeptical
as to character, and its value in a man’s

But let me telt you right now, it’s
K.’ I thought more of being on the
alert, catching the big opportunity as it
passed, and being a good fellow among
one's associates. These things are good,
but as I have seen more of life, and
studied those things which make for
true success, I have found that the fun-
damental basis of such a life is true
working character. We see it every-

where, in business, and all around us to- |

day, those who forge ahead, and who
gain success, are those whose lives are
founded on this basis of character that
holds true. This is no pretense or sham,
but rather like, after a cold shower and
a good rub-down, that thrill that runs
through every vein of your body, and
you feel clean all through. ,
“But how do we get this character?

then that will guide us. In every crisis
we move by reflex, and it is our past ac-

alone can guide us right. Every day will
have its contest, and every day we are
building character. Watch the little

turer on English literature.

He will deliver an address at the Sec-
ond Presbyterian Church in Charlotte

ferent English classes Monday and Tues-
day and give brief talks to the students.

VERY STRONG SERMON

Dr. Richards delivered one of his
strongest sermons last Sunday morning,
urging his people to “line up” with
Christ. With a force born of conviction,
Dr Richards said: “If the church would
do its duty the whole |, Blobe would be
covered in three years.”

His text was taken from John 6:29 and
16:9: “This is the work of God, that

ing Christ, taking him as our Redeemer
and friend for life. We do not hesitate
calling in a physician when we are sick,
yet we put off calling the Great Physi-
cian who died that we might live.

In closing Dr. Richards pointed out
that we have no option on life for “we
know not the day nor the hour.” But
the great test is, “Will you accept him
whom he has sent?”

November 16 is the date of the next
number of Redpath’s Lyceum given at
Davidson. This number will consist of
a musical program given by the Original
Swiss Singers and Yodlers. In this
company Redpath offers its patrons a
unique musical organization that com-
bines novelty with real musical merit.

. This company was organized original-
ly in Innsbueck, one of the most pic-
turesque places in the Swiss Tyrol,
which is the summer haunt of many
royal personages and is the very heart
and cradle of the music-loving, music-
living Tyroleans. From their Alpine
homes these singers and instrumentalists
have been selected by their © famous
directoress, Mrs. Otto Fiechtl, are train-
ed and rehearsed in their world famous
folk and inimitable yodel and warbling
songs. They appear in the picturesque
and beautiful national costume of these
people, and two complete changes of
costume are made durin g their program.

Mrs. Fiecht!’s family has for genera-
tions been known as leading folk-sing,
ers and yodlers among their own people,
holding unquestioned rank as master
artists in their craft. A few years ago
in a six days’ yodle and song contest in
Innsbueck this family made good the
claim by winning first prize from rep-
resentatives of the entire Tyrol land.

Davidson is fortunate in securing this
company for one of the Lyceum num-
bers and a real treat is in store Novem-
ber 16.
