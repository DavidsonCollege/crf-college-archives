Page Four. THE DAVIDSONIAN
° ; Te Ver)
Music News Y
By Frank Barr
The Concert Series was opened Cornet...

with one of the best concerts ever

to be present at Davidson, To the
surprise of many new students there
were many out-of-town guests from
Charlotte, Concord, Kannapolis, Shel-
by, and Rock Hill. ‘This helps prove
how good our series really is.

“Many students were complaining
about having to buy tickets to the
Concert Series. The members of Phi
Mu Alpha hope to remedy the situa-
tion. If a majority of the students
desire it, the concert Series Fee can
be included in the tuition. For several
years, the athletic fee has been paid
for at the beginning of the year ‘as
part of the tuition. The plan has been
successful, We hope to try it with
the Concert Series. There will soon
be a petition circulating about school.
If you agree with us in our efforts,
please sign the petition so that we will
be able to have this fee included in the
catalogue for next year.

The members of the student body
have been taking advantage of the
Carnegie Set since it has been moved
to Phi,Hall. You can find the records
in use during the week and especially
on the week-ends. Phi Hall is always
open on Saftrday and Sunday after-
noons. If you have nothing to do,
drop by then. I’m sure you'll enjoy
yourself.

At a recent rehearsal of the David-

son College Concert Band, an election |

of officers for this year was held.
The officers chosen are as follows:
Sam Lineberger, President; Carroll
Herrion, Vice-President; Harry Mc-
Lean, Secretary-treasurer ; Frank Barr
Jr., Business Manager; Spencer Mur-
ray, Band executive committee mem-

ber.

VISIT COLE’S

By Newt Spencer

Have you ‘taken advantage of your
opportunities at Davidson? What op-
portunities? One, for instance, is that
of visiting faculty homes Sunday even-
ings. This is a golden opportunity to
get to know your professors on the
“out-of-classroom” side. From the
early days of the college the homes
of the Faculty were open to the
students and a very cordial welcome
has always greeted all who were will-
ing to accept the generous hospitality
extended. A taste of home is offered
to you—also a taste of delicious food.
Make it a point next Sunday—to put
your last minute studies off-a few
hours longer — and visit a faculty
home.

It was great to see four buses load-
ed with charming young ladies from
Queens stop at Davidson. It was
greater still to watch Ed Golden»per-
form, Everything was handled expertly
—and Queen’s-Davidson Day may be
marked up on our list of successes.

Fall Services are to be held Nov-
Lember_6,/7, and 8. For you new men
this will be an, experience you shall
long remember. It is our religious em-
phasis week. Something different is
being done this year—instead of one

|| guest speaker, there will be four. In-

formal” discussion’ groups—“bull ses-
,sions’—are being planned so as to
reach everybody more personally than
has been done in the past. Mark these
special dates on your calendar.

Mr. Roy Cooper, representative of:-
the Regional Office of the National
Y.M.C.A.,_ visited Davidson Campus
October 23rd, and 24th. He brought
some valuable information to our “Y”
—and left some constructive sugges-
tions for bettering our local Set up.
During his short visit, Mr. Cooper, in-
terviewed Dr. Cunningham; and he
addressed the Wednesday night meet-
ing of the “Y” Cabinet. :

Boy’s Work is well under way this
year. Football practice for small boys
is held every afternoon, except Wed-
nesday, at 2 o'clock on the Freshman
Field. Herb Wyatt is heading up this
particular Department which is in-
cluded in the “Y” Cabinet. Herb Glad-
den, and Gene Linton are doing com-
mendable work with these small
friends. Harry McLean, who is in
charge of Scout Work on the “Y”

Davidson, N. C.:

Cabinet is doing a fine job re-organiz-
ing troops in the area that have died
out in the past year or two,

The pool room is still in good shape.
No rips—no tips..Alan Cameron used
a special receipe—and succeeded in
gluing tips on the cues that didn’t ;
drop off for almost two weeks.

The history of our local Y.M.C.A.
is interesting. According to Miss
Shaw, author of “Davidson College”
—the date of the organization the “Y”
is not definitely known. It was men-
tioned in a catalogue for the first time
in 1878-79, Collections of funds were
made in 1889—and building was erect-
ed and completed in 1891. This build-
ing was noteworthy from the fact that
it was_the first one erected on a
southern college campus for Y.M.C.A,.
work, That building has served David-
son students for a half a century—
but it has recently disappeared. The
“Old Gym” which toppled over with
little resistance was also the old “Y”
building. Have you stopped by to see
what_a fine building the Y.M.C.A.
now has. Do it today. Everybody at
Davidson is a member of the “Y’’. Re-
member! The most important letter
in Y.M.C.A. is the “C’ for Christian.
Live like a Christian,

Trust in yourself and you are
doomed to disappointment; trust in
your friends, and they will die and
leave you: trust in your money, and
you may have it taken from you;
trust in reputation, and some slan-
derous tongue’ may Dlast it. but
trust in God, and you-are never
confounded in time or eternity.

—Dwight L. Moody.
