See Ya’ in the Tourney
Wildcats take Charleston (19-2) to the wire

Could it get any better?

Could it get any worse?

Davidson’s men’s basketball team
had the perfect opportunity in front of a
conference home game record crowd

@ Ton dropped in 22 points.

(5,499) to show the world why they are
the defending Southern Conference
champions.
And they did it. . . for 33 minutes.
Unfortunately, Davidson still had
to play 40 minutes last night against the
College of Charleston Cougars.

Davidson seemed poised for the
challenge from the opening tip. In the
first half, the Wildcats hit 65 percent of
their shots while jumping out to a 15
point half-time lead on a deep three
point bomb from Ali Ton. As the ball
fell crisply through the net, Ton pumped
his fist and pointed toward the student
section.

Charleston—like a tired and worn

; out heavy weight boxer—

appeared in shock as they
took Davidson’s hardest
punch. But twenty minutes
remained and the Cougars
were still standing.

“Bob McKillop
had them hitting home runs
tonight, especially in the first
half. In the first half we
couldn’t stop Davidson,”
proclaimed Cougar coach
John Kresse.

In a performance remi-
niscent of earlier match-ups
against Navy, Wake Forest,
Colgate and UNCC, the
Wildcats played nearly flaw-
less basketball until a cover
was put on the basket.

In fact, Davidson only
scored two baskets in the last
eight minutes of the game.
Tocompound Davidson’ s of-
fensive frustations, Charles-

, ton scored on all nine of their
Anna Judy attempts from the floor in the
last seven minutes.

Tied at 78 all, Charleston’s Danny
Johnson sealed the deal when he pulled
down an offensive rebound offa Sedric
Webber missed free throw and then
made a long three in front of his coach,
John Kresse.

“If we had a drought in the last six
minutes, we wouldn’ thave hadachance.

27 points in eight minutes, that’ s in-
credible,” said Kresse.

Coach McKillop was as elated with
his team’s performance as he was dis-
appointed. “I thought our effort tonight
was outstanding.”

But the tides turned after a
breakaway lay-in by junior forward
Landry Kosmalski.

“At that point, I thought we
couldn’t give them any easy shots and
we did,” said Coach McKillop. “They
were then feeling that little breath of
confidence. Bottom line, we had to get
stops and we didn’t get them. We got
caught in the mud in the second half.”

Ali Ton led the way for the Wild-
cats as he scored a new career- high 22
points to go along with his team high
nine assists. But his performance was
not enough as Davidson took quick
complacent shots down the stretch.

Webber led all scorers with 24
points. Webber and mates only turned
the ball over two times in the second
half, hit 60 percent of their shots, and
pulled down seven offensive rebounds.

The Wildcats know that save for
the conference tournament, one game
does not a season make.

“I'd rather have this experience
now than in February,” declared Coach
McKillop.

And what an experience for both
teams, the crowd and everyone in the
building.

“T have never been on any other
campus in the Southern Conference with
this kind of atmosphere,” asserted Coach
McKillop.

John Kresse took it even a step
further: “The atmosphere tonight was
fantastic. It was an ACC type atmo-
sphere. It doesn’t get any better at any
place, even at Cameron, at the Dean
Dome, or at Maryland.”
