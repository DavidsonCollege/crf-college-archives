Field hockey looks forward to another successful season

By Mandy Curtis

The field hockey team won
their first official game of the sea-
son on Sunday, September 5
against Appalachain State Univer-
sity.

~The Wildcats traveled to
Boone, North Carolina to defeat
Appalachain with a score of 2-0.
The Cats dominated the game 35-
7 in shots.

Senior Jill Bennett, a defen-
sive player, scored the first goal of
the game in the first half. Sopho-
more Holly Kledis, an offensive
player, doubled the score with an-
other goal inthesecond half. Goal-
ies Emily Coleman, a senior, and
Mary Ferguson, a junior, both saw
time in the game and had twosaves
each.

The game against Appalachain
was the first of several turf games
that the Wildcats will play this

season. According to Captain and
senior Suzanne Hardesty, the team
hada “really shaky start because of
the turf” on Sunday. However,
with some adjustments, the team
started “playing their game” using
many small passes.

According tosome of the play-
ers on the Davidson team,
Appalachain was very “cocky”
about the game on Sunday because
they thought Davidson had lost
their entire team with last year’s
senior class.

However, Davidson proved to
be the better team with much expe-
rience.

The Appalachain players were
not the only people who did not
know what to expect of the
Davidson hockey team this year,
according to Hardesty.. With the
loss of five starting seniors last
year, Hardesty thought the year

would be a “rebuilding year” for a
younger, less experienced team.
However, Hardesty reassessed that
the starting line-up is very strong.

“We work well together; we’re an ©

experienced team.”

According to Hardesty, the ©

hockey team, including the newest
nine additions, has many things to
work on for the many turf games.
Hardesty said, “We need to take it
one game at a time.”

This weekend the Cats will go
to Washington, D.C. where they
will play Georgetown University
and Towson State University.
These two turf games will give the
hockey team three games experi-
ence before they play Duke away
on September 15.

The hockey team began the
season with three sessions a day
during pre-season. Then on Satur-
day, September 4 the Wildcats

than junior Neal Andrews. Slagle
comments that “nobody works
harder at his craft than Neal
Andrews... Heis ready to play and
the players are ready to play for
him.”

Other set starters will be se-
niors Ed Denning at sweeper and
Andy Haile in the midfield along
with sophmores Ryan Northington
at left midfield and Ian O’brien,
who does not have a set position
yet, but will start. This leaves three
starting slots open for grabs. Two
other players to note are junior
Zack Eastman and senior Bryce
Smith. Both are recovering from
injuries, but should see a lot of
playing timeonce they are healthy.

Those competing for these
spots include a strong freshman
class, that has five players on the

Varsity roster. Slagle believes that
this may be the best class ever at
Davidson, but this cannot be deter-
mined until 1997.

junior John Olin looks on during a pre-season practice.

The freshmen include last
year’s leading high school scorer
in Florida, Robert Clarke from
Pensacola. Other freshmen from
Florida are Fernando Campos from
Miami and Coley Dominiak from
Ponte Verda Beach.

The remaining freshmen are
Keith Kleeman from Cincinnati
and Chad Lagerway from
Elmhurst, IL. From impressive
results ‘in practice, Campos and
Kleeman have strong causes for
starting positions.

Anchored by junior Mills Ariail, the
footbal team's defense should remain solid

Football contined from page 13

there are some very capable wide
receivers in Kelly Shirley, Ward
Davis, Del Turner, and Ike Bailey.
Junior running backs Bruce Ban-
nister and Shane Mills will carry
the ball for the Cats this year. Last
year, Bannister was second on the
team with 353 rushing yards.

Reserve quarterback Kevin
Holzworth will play a lot this sea-
son; many times in the same
backfield as Howell. Landis com-
mented, “we want to get the maxi-
mum out of their talent and could
use both of them in the backfield at
the same time.

"Our basic offense will be the
same as last year. We’ll continue
to throw the football a lot, but we
want to get the option going a little
more.”

With eight returning starters,
Davidson’s defense remains solid.

Seniorsafety Frank Houghton, who
led the team with four sacks last
year, will join Smith in the defen-
sive backfield.

Junior Jason Branch will man
the same corner spot as he did a
year ago when he racked up 43
tackles and three interceptions.
Davidson also expects help from
junior Andre Ferree.. Davidson’s
linebackers this year include John
Dalton, Bill Evans, Mark Hemby,
and Chris Leak.

Dalton leads the team with
195 career tackles and Evans led
the team the past two seasons with
84 tackles each. Leak makes the
big plays for the Cats. Last year his

‘statistics included 78 tackles, two
- caused fumbles, and three inter-

ceptions.

~" Davidson’ front four willcre-
ate havoc on their opponents this
season. They are led by Mills Ariail,
who at 6-4, 285 pounds, is hard for

any offensive line to contain. Coach
Landis described this years de-
fense: “Defensively, we have a
great small college player in Mills
Ariail, He’ll anchor our defensive
line. Mix in Chris Leak and Alden
Smith and you’ve got the makings
of an effective defense. Chris and

Alden are both outstanding ath- .

letes.” .

Curtis Burns, Bo
Bartholomew, James Cassidy will
join Ariail on the defensive line.
Seniors Chris Freer and Tim
Carrigan contributed in the past
and their experience will come in
handy.

Allin all, 1993 should turn out
tobe an exciting year for Davidson
football. With the fresh ideas of a
new coach and the experience of a
team loaded with seniors, the Wild-
cats expect to improve on last year’s
record of 5-5,

As usual, the Wildcats have
one of the toughest schedules in
the nation, facing 7 of the top 20
teams in the nation. This stiff com-
petition should help the young play-
ers mature quickly. The home
schedule is excellent for soccer
fans, featuring matches against
UNCC, Duke, Furman, Wake For-
est, NC State, Appalachian State
and Marshall. The Southern Con-
ference should be more balanced
this year as the the top three teams
all lost seven or eight starters.

Also new is the guarantee of
an automatic bid to the NCAA
Tournamnet for the Southern Con-
ference tournament champion. This
honor makes the conference tour-
nament all the more important.

With the loss of star Rob Ukrop
in the middle of the front line, fans
should expect more play from the
sidelines to exploit Ben Hayes’
talents at finishing crossed balls.
Slagle expects a very offensive
team with a pressure zone defense.

n high expectations and new players

There are two new rules this year
that affect play. The first prohibits
the keeper from picking up a ball
passed back to him by the feet (no
passes from midfield for punts).
The second gives the keeper only
five seconds to release the ball
once he gains full control (no stall-
ing). Both should make the game
faster and more offensive.

There is a great deal of opti-
mism surrounding the 1993 sea-
son. The team is primed and strong
enough to defend their Southern
Conference title and make an ap-
pearance inthe NCAA tournament
for the second year in a row. A big
factor in the success of last year’s
team was the outstanding fan sup-
port at every meet.

This fan support is essential
for the team’s success and will be
needed for the 7 home games this
season. While it will be very diffi-
cult fo outdue last year’s ‘sensa-
tional performance, the ‘Cats are
exicited about the year’s prospects.
