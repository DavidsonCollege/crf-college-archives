HABITAT FOR HUMANITY

Just in case any of you have
been wondering what happened
to the excitement that was build-
ing last semester about the Wild-
cat Habitat project, get ready be-
cause it's just the beginning. to
date, we have raised $25,002.
Even though the goal is in sight,
we’still have the last leg of the
fundraising effort to go.

Some of the fundraising ef-
forts that will be taking place this
semester is the continuation of
the Hammerhead campaign, the
selling of t-shirts, and a Battle of
the Bands. If you have any ideas
for fundraisers or would like to be
a Hammerhead please contact
Amy Hawfield (6636), Kurt
Holmes (2188), Magdalena Maiz-
Pena (2245), or JD Dupuy (6646).

The site for the house has
been chosen: 537 West Side Ter-
race, Davidson. The ground has
been too wet for the foundation to
be laid, but with the right condi-
tions this week building can be-
gin on January 27. Building days
for the semester will be on Thurs-

days 12-5 p.m. and Saturdays 8-12
a.m. and 12-5 p.m. If you are
interested in helping with the build-
ing of the house, look for volunteer
forms in the Union or in the Li-
brary.

Brian Andrews of Interna-
tional Kitchen and Bath has of-
fered free installation and delivery
of all the cabinets in the house.
Andrews read about the project in
the Mecklenburg Gazette and de-,
cided to help. He says he is sup-
portive of the community and hopes
this project will bring together the
community and the college.
Andrews is also letting us buy the
cabinets at the manufacture charge
which well help us with the overall
cost of the house. The estimated
cost of these cabinets is $800.

To anyone who has been
abroad or would like more. infor-
mation on ways to be involved in

. theis project, please contact Smita

Donthamsetty (6730) or Catherine
Turner (2460).

Chess

from page 2

New York loomed nearer. Refus-
ing to give up the match, Benn
finally secured a victory with no
time to spare. Teammates handed
him his coat and suitcase as he

sprinted to a waiting taxi.

With a tournament record of
5-0-1, Ballard shared a first place
individual ranking among “first
players” with a Russian-born
grandmaster from New York.

A competitor in ranked com-
petitions for the past eight years,
Ballard won the U.S. Junior Open
Championship in the under 17 di-

vision in 1990.

Thomas, Benn, and
Gospodnetic all have high school
chess team experience.

Davidson’s representatives at
the Pan-American Championships
were selected from among 17 par-
ticipants in Davidson’s campus-
wide championships held in No-
vember.

The team has high expecta-
tions and many plans for the future
of Davidson chess. Members are
interested in organizing a regional
league to increase opportunities
for competition.

Ballard, founder of chess club;
explains that the club meets every
Thursday in the Union Conference
Room at 9:30 p.m.

WALT
back on
the air

After several years of plan-
ning, WALT will finally broadcast
to the masses of Davidson, North
Carolina starting next week.

The station will feature pro-
gramming 6 a.m.-2 a.m., seven
days a week. According to
Churchill Hooff, station manager,
WALT willconsist of “college type
broadcasting ... we will play mu-
sic that students at Davidson don’t
get on Charlotte stations.”

Several students will host the
shows, which will range from jazz
to 80s music. A phone line has
beenconnected to the studio, which
is in basement Belk.

The station has become a real-
ity after years of hard work. Hooff
has been working on resurrecting
the station, which has not broad-
cast in at least 10 years, since his
freshman year.

After working with several
different committees, WALT re-
ceived a charter from the Union
and the Activities Tax Council.
“We were lucky to get the money
we asked for.”

The station operated for about
two weeks at the end of last semes-
ter, and will air practice broadcasts
this week.

Sitting in your room wondering what to do with that Michael Bolton CD your aunt gave you for
Christmas? Well, we certainly don't want it. But we do buy CD's (just not swill like that). And we
have lots of new CD's. And we do special orders. And we're a Ticketmaster outlet. And blather,
blather, blather, on and on and on.....
