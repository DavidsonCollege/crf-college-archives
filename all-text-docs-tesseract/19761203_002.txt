Emergency in

By DOLLY PARTON
Mostly Hair

Following Davidson’s first
confirmed case of swine flu,
doctors gathered quickly at
the Infirmary Thursday and
set up an emergency innocu-
lation program aimed at halt-
ing further spread of the
disease.

Nurses would not release
the name of the freshman who
has the dreaded flu. One
commented, ‘‘He won't be the
only one. Kids have been:
coming in since Wednesday
complaining about various
ills, and several of them show
preliminary signs of the swine
flu. We only have a few beds
left here.’’

One doctor stated: ‘‘We
don’t want to cause undue
alarm or panic, but the disease
is upon us. We are concerned
because less than half the
students and faculty came by
this week to receive their
shots. There is nothing to
prevent an epidemic of swine
flu at Davidson College.

‘We are requesting that all
students and faculty gather at
the Infirmary at 8 am Friday.
We will then begin shooting
everyone up.

‘‘Those who have not yet
been innoculated will be al-
lowed to go in first—they. are
in the most danger.

‘Even those who were inno-
culated earlier this week
should come to the Infirmary
—they too are in danger. We
didn’t expect any problem
until January, the peak of the
flu season. So we've been
giving only mild doses this
week —doses that would stim-
ulate the body to form anti-
bodies but would not cause
harmful side effects. Since
these people were only innocu-
lated this week, their bodies
have not had time to build up
immunity,’’ continued the
doctor.

The shots to be given Fri-
day are much more potent
than earlier ones. Doctors
admit that most who are inno-
culated will come down with at
least a mild case of the flu, but
one doctor says, ‘‘It’s either
that or—well, let’s just say
that taking the shot Friday is
the only viable alternative.”’

tions. with innoculations.

The Davidsonian went to
College President Samuel R.
Spencer's office to get his
comment on the emergency
innoculation plan. Spencer's
assistant, Peter Clark, said
that ‘‘he is discussing impor-
tant admissions matters with
Director of Admissions H.
Edmunds White, and cannot
be reached for comment.”’

Following a hunch, this
reporter went to the tennis

STUDENT CHANCES complica-

courts where Spencer and
White were discussing admis-
sions over a heated tennis
match.

Said Spencer: ‘‘Swine flu?
Well, no, I haven't heard
about it— ACE! — What are we
doing about it? Well, I don't
really know—OUT? What do
you mean .-OUT?.. HD,
YOU'RE A TURKEY!—Say,
this hasn't happened at Wil-
liams College yet, has it? I

believe we've finally beat them
to the draw on something.

‘T'll tell you my opinion,
son— Davidson was a good
college before the swine flu,
and, by golly, she'll be a good
college after it.”

White was puzzled at the
reports of swine flu. ‘I know

—we've been expanding our

recruiting eiiorts, but I’m
almost certain that we haven't
yet accepted any pigs at
Davidson,"’ he said.

Professor Alexander J. Mc-
Kelway is circulating a peti-
tion amongst the faculty re-
commending that classes be
dismissed Friday to encourage
students to participate in the
emergency innoculation - pro-
gram.

“There are so many Repu-
blicans in this student body,
I'm afraid they may be too
backward and morally dull to
know that it’s good for them
to take the shot. We have a
responsibility to encourage
and educate them.”

Registrar Richard Burts
was asked if classes might be
cancelled on Friday so the

ulation attacks flu

students and faculty could go
to the Infirmary.

‘‘No, I’m afraid not—I
mean, we can't let something
like the swine flu halt acad-
emic progress at Davidson. I’d
like to help, but my hands are
tied.”

The Davidson Christian
Fellowship was the first stu-
dent organization to publicly
endorse the emergency pro-
gram. A DCF leader outlined
the group’s plans:

“Part of our people will be
combing the campus,. passing
out ‘You need it!’ buttons and
stickers and encouraging all to
take the shot. Others will give
each student an ‘I’ve had it!’
button after he is innoculated.
We'll also be supplying coffee,
hot chocolate, and divine pat-
ience to those braving the cold
weather to stand in line Fri-
day.

Ron Scott, hosting a pork
barbecue at Rush House, took
time out to comment: ‘Well,
they can’t blame this one on
me. The students always say

Center studies river’s meager beaver

By HELEN BEDD
Staff Writer

Dr. Robert Avinger, Dean
of the Center for Honors
Studies, announced a new
interdisciplinary program in-
volving all members of the
Center.

The project will be a study
of why there are no beaver in
the Rocky River. This follows
the Center’s study of pollution
in the Rocky River during
which it was discovered that
the college was the major
polluter. That, of course, was
smoothly brushed under the
rug and the blame was affixed
on the broad area covered by
Acts of God.

The team heading the study
will be Professors Charles
Cornwell, Robert Avinger, D.
Grant, and Robert Palmer.
Avinger explained, ‘‘The de-
tails have not been worked out
and we’ll wing it as usual.

... P.O. shutdown

ing as student housing. Nich-
olls is optimistic about the
prospect. “The building has
such a convenient location in
relation to campus that it
would make ideal housing.
The costs would be minimal.
We would have to move in
beds, but besides that, stu-
dent needs would. be taken
care of by the @xisting internal
structures. For example, stu-
‘dents could roll up their
clothes and stuff them in the
post. office boxes.”’

The ‘loss of local ‘postal
service will undoubtedly be
troublesome, but Davidson
residents can draw comfort

from the fact that small town
residents all over the country
will be confronted with similar
problems, including students
at Williams College. As Will
Terry puts it, ‘‘Sure, it’s an

inconvenience, but these are .

hard times financially for the
government and we all need to
tighten our belts, so to speak,
and help them out a little.
Students will be very disorien-
ted at ten in the morning with
no post office to rush to so
we're attempting to organize a
daily morning march on the
laundry to deal with their need
to congregate during ten
o'clock break.”’

What we hope to find out is
why there are no beaver
currently in the fiver and why.
Possibly we'll try and reintro-
duce beaver to this area.
What's a river without beaver
anyway?”

When asked if there have
ever been beaver in the river,
Avinger responded, ‘‘There’s
no conclusive evidence either
way. There have been uncon-
firmed reports of fossil beaver
finds but there definitely
aren't any live ones out there
because I looked myself.”

Avinger also explained why
another field project involving
the Rocky River was chosen,
‘“We had such a good time

ivity in Rocky River.

COUPLE examines biological act-

running around in the mud
last time we said ‘why stop?’
We social science types don’t
get a chance to get out in the
field much and a beaver hunt
seemed just right. We don’t
want to become. intellectually
sterile over here. Besides,
since we don’t have any Phys.
Ed. requiremerits we thought
it would be good exercise. We
want to get our students out of
the academic closets and after
beaver.”

_Dr. Cornwell, Professor of
English, sniffed the air broad-
ly and then explained his role
in the project. ‘‘We’d like to
bring in related texts about
beaver. I realize Henry James

did not write about them but
I will endeavor to find out
something about them any-
way.

Dr. Mr. Grant, the husband
of Dr. Mrs. Grant, feels that
most of .he empirical study
will fall to him. ‘‘After spiders
it was natural that I move up
to beaver. Why I remember
seeing.a species of aquatic
beaver on the Galapagos Is-
lands...’’ Grant added, ‘Don
Kimmel -is also going to help
out. We were going to use him
as a lure until he shaved his
mustache. He’s still interested
though. As Don always says,
‘If it has sex, I'll study it.’ Of
course we're not sure if beaver
indiginous to Davidson have
any sex at all.”

Robert Palmer of the psych
department envisions making
up tests. ‘‘I love tests. Never
can have enough statistics,
especially when you're not
sure what you're talking
about. You've heard of the
Thurston scale? We're going
to use a slightly modified
version called the Thurstin
Scale to see if there really is a
need for beaver in the area.

Oh, and it will be multiple
choice, of course.”

Avinger explained his role
as coordinator, ‘I’m supposed

j to coordinate this thing.

That’s my job. That’s what
they pay me for. So that’s my
role. I’m also going to demand
ounces because I get off on
them. Even though beaver are
the best dam builders I doubt
if there is:much of a desire for
them around Davidson. But

_ then again if we manipulate

the statistics properly we

could probably fake a demand.
Who knows what we'll find."’
