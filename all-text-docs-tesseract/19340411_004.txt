CINDERMEN MEET.
TENNESSEE SATURDAY

e:

Well, I must admit that I never saw
a place so changed in such a short

period in my life. Before we went
away for the holiday period, it was
cold. and dreary on the campus, and
the trees were bare and wintry. The
students went about their, work with
a certain amount of pep and vigor.

Then, look at it now.
ing an advanced shade of green, robins
everywhere, and the students lolling
around the campus in a state of sus-
pended animation, with thoughts of
everything else but in their
What a change!

Trees show-

lessons

minds,

The boys in the light clads are
noticing it, too, and things are pick-
ing up all around. Wildcat sports
are showing up in an excellent
manner this spring so far. We
might go so far as to say that
prospects look very bright for two
teams finishing an undefeated sea-
son this spring.

Congratulations to the tennis
team on the fine showing they
have made for themselves thus far.
Seven victories in a row are not
to be sneezed at. And they weren't
made against any puny teams,
either. Take Georgia Tech, Emory,
South Carolina—oh, any one of
those teams rates well.

Captain Halverstadt and his team-
mates have a fine aggregation there,
and one which will be hard to beat.
I'd like to see them fight the Carolina
bunch this spring, and we'll probably
get a chance, because they are sched-
uled to meet here. It will be worth
watching, and the outcome will be in-
teresting.

_ The boys of the cinderpath have
rendered a rather full account of
themselves so far, too, by the way.
Those of you who saw the meet
with Richmond last Saturday will
agree with me that they will be
standing up for their rights also
That Richmond team
was a good one, in fact, one of the
best in the history of the college,

this year.

and that adds to the Wildcats’
glory.
With Captain Cochran consistently

turning in sterling performances in the
weights, a pair of speedsters worth
‘Watching, and at least two distance
men that can push anything in the
state, this issue of the Davidson team
will bear watching.

The fréshman squad was outclassed
this week by a splendid Richmond
irosh team, The Virginia lads simply
had the best of the deal on all turns.
We notice that in one weight, event
they actually beat the varsity distance,
throwing the javelin about two feet
farther.

Well, it seems that the baseball
team, reorganized by Coach Laird,
has at last come into its own. They
came out handily to win the second
game from State by a stirring
eighth-inning rally. The boys have
a lot to measure up to if they fol-
low the example set them by last
year’s state championship team.

But they should be able to go to
town now that they have the winning
spirit. They miss the figure of Shrimp
Morris standing behind them a little,
I believe. They have some good boys
in there this year, though, and ought
to do some good playing yet.

Congratulations to Mack Holland

on winning the basketball trophy.
Mack was one of the driving mo-
tives behind the Wildcat play this
year, and surely deserves praise
for his reliability. That trophy will
be something to fight for in the
future,

Although the Wildcat golfers have
yet to play their first match, we feel
that something should be said as to
prospects, Their first match will be a
hard one, They meet Furman, which
reputedly has a whale of a well-round-
ed team. Luck to the lads in their
initial venture, You may be sure they’ll
do their best.

As this page goes into new hands,
for good probably, for the first
time, we'd like to ask your toler-
ance until the editor gains more
experience, and your aid in making
sports what ‘they should -be.

CAT BALL CLUB
DEFEAT PACK IN.
BIG FIVE GAME

Davidson Nine Shows Spurt After
Losing Two to Carolina

STATE WINS ONE

Bumgarner and Mock Drive
Homers in Victory

The Davidson Wildcat baseball team,
Big Five champions last year, got off
to a slow start this season, losing two
games to Carolina, and breaking even
in the series of games with State. The
lone victory with the Raleigh team
came as a result of a shift in line-up,
with Wingfield in centerfield instead
of behind the plate, McLean on first
base, Smyre at third, and Ravenel as
catcher. The revamped combination
presented by Coach Laird enabled the
‘Cats to click for the first time this
year.

Carolina, 15; Davidson, 4

The Tar Heels, led by Ernest Me-
Keithan, pitcher, and Tommy Irvin,
shortstop, collected 16 safe hits, most
of them solid and resounding smacks
otf of Coble and Jenkins who. pitched
for the ‘Cats. Wingfield, Mock, Mor-
gan, and Ravenel weré responsible for
Davidson's four runs.

Davidson Trackmen
To Meet Tennessee

Pritchett Expects Hard Fight
From Strong Foes

On Friday morning the Davidson
track team will make its way to Knox-
vilfe, Tenn., where Saturday it, will
engage the strong University of Ten-
nessee team on its home field.

Tennessee has a strong team this
year, having just recently defeated
Maryville College by more than 20
points. Davidson showed up well in
the Southern Indoor Conference meet
at Chapel Hill, and has recently over-
come the Furman and University of
Richmond trackmen here. The latter
institution is said to have one of its

strongest teams in recent years.

The spirit of the school and the team
was expressed recently by Captain N.
G. Pritchett, who said: “ Tennessee has
a strong team, but we feel that we
should be able to take them.”

Davidson Netmen To
Make Virginia Tour

To Visit Charlottesville, Wil-
liamsburg, and Richmond

Davidson's first six ranking tennis
players left this morning on a tour
through Virginia. Tomorrow the team
will play a match with the University
of Virginia at Charlottesville. They
Will meet William and Mary College on
Friday at Williamsburg, and Saturday

pose the Wildcats at Richmond.

Those players making the trip are,
in order of their rank, Captain Halver-
stadt, Tee Thompson, John Lafferty,
Martin Barnett, Francis Scott, Carlyle
Lewis, and Manager Wee Thompson.

The Country Club of Virginia is ex-
pected to furnish very strong competi-
tion for Davidson's netmen, as they
are credited with having the best ten-
nis team in the state, The University
of Virginia probably has the first rank-
ing intercollegiate team in ‘the state.

The Wildcats have made an excellent
showing this season and, if they can
come--through this series undefeated,
they will be well in line for champion-
ship honors,

Golf Team To Play
First With Furman

The Davidson varsity golf team will
open its season Thursday afternoon
when they meet the Furman Univer-
sity golfers on the Carolina golf course
in Charlotte.

While this is the first match for Da-
vidson, Furman has the advantage of

this season, losing only to Georgia
Tech. In one of these matches they
defeated the strong University of Rich-
mond team, |

The team now composed of
Barnes, Bowman, Bunn, Cannon, and
Hamrick. From this group four will
be selected to compete in the match,
the other serving as alternate.

On Friday afternoon the Davidson
