All That

By JIM HAMILTON

Davidson won’t make the Rose Bowl or the Sugar
Bowl this year, but come Saturday they will meet Fur-
man in the first Carrousel Bowl.

The affair has grown to considerable proportions.
Many of the princesses and bands in the parade will be
at the stadium and will participate in the pre-game and
half time entertainment.

There seems to he a lot of interest in the game
in Charlotte. At present advance ticket sales are
approaching 6,000. The distributor ordered a thous-
and more over the original 5,000 he requested.

In view of the support given the game by the peo-

THE DAVIDSONIAN

i

at

a,

ple of Charlotte, I think it is fitting that the students

should also back this event which promises to be an an-
nual affair.

I missed the Richmond game Saturday due to the
press convention, but when I got back there was still
blood on the field.

The injury list sounded more like the result of a
free-for-all than a football game. John Watwood and Dan-
ny Voigt were sporting big black eyes. George Hart and
Danny House both had cuts that required stitches. Char-
lie Benson had as many bruises as the bottom tomato in
a bushel basket. Alex Porter, Lynwood Mallarc, Jim
Bloomfield, and Craig Wall also were on the list, Wall
with an intercostal tear in the cartilage between his ribs.
Both Wall and Mallard had to be treated at Durham.

Coach Dole, even though he retained his usual
composed manner when ! talked to him, was in-
censed. “We took an awful beating,” he said. He
cancelled all contact work scheduled for this week
in practice.

Dole had prepared a series of photos that were print-
ed in the Charlotte Observer Wednesday, showing in
particular the rough house mauling of quarterback Char-
lie Benson.

“The game followed the same pattern as the Rich-
mond game five years ago,” said the coach, “when Da-
vidson quarterback Johnny Gray had his shoulder torn
up so badly he never played again. They were doing
the same thing to Benson, hitting him from the blind
side after he had handed the ball off and was relaxed.
He was just luckier than Gray.”

We've got one consolation, however. The Richmond
team must have a sore bunch of knuckles and elbows.

Coach Scott has announced that family basketball
season tickets are available in the gymnasium. The price
of these tickets is five dollars.

The All-Fraternity flickerball team was chosen this weck
with eight men on each of the first two teams. Donny McQueen.
who received the most votes is honorary captain.

increased their lead in the

I-F sports competition this week, scoring a decisive vic-
tory on the mats Monday and Tuesday nights. The win-
ners posted 63 points and were followed by the Ka’s,

Betas and Phi Delts.

Ervin Funderburk (KS) pin
ned Butch Zimmerman (KA)
and Pat Rush (Phi Gam) to take
the lightweight honors in the
123 pound division.

The 130 pound class was
dominated by the Beta'’s Mike

Van Doeren. a very stylish and

aggressive freshman who out-
pointed Tommy Lucas (SAE)
6-2 for the championship. Wes-
ley Weeks boosted the Betas
point column, pinning John Mc-
Queen (KS) for the 137 pound
class in a very fast-moving con-
test.

John Poindexter repeated his
victory in the 147 pound divi-
sion. beating Tommy Parker
(SAE) and pinning Joe Kelley
(KS) in the finals.

The 157 pound finals ended
in a default ceding Forest Wil-
kerson (KA) the title as his
opponent failed to show. .

The 167 pound class surprised
many fans as Bobby Street (KS),
last year’s champion, was elimi-

nated by Tim Cloninger (Phi.

Gam) who in turn fell to fresh-
man Butch LeDoyen (SX). Le-
Doyen pinned Dick Dalton
(Beta) in the finals.

Freshman

(Phi Delt) and Joe Weld (SPE)
to lead his class.

Cats are still limping a bit from the no-holds-barred
donney-brook with Richmond last week.

The Spiders thwarted a Da-

vidson bid for the most suc-
cessful won tost record in its

history as they tallied a pair
of touchdowns in the final sev-
en minutes of play to pull
ahead 27-22.

The Cats broke the ice
in the first quarter on a
four yard run by Charlie
Benson. Richmond came
back with a TD and the
extra point to make it 7-4.
Davidson carried a 9-7 edge
into the dressing room at
the half on the strength of
Bruce Usher’s 26 yard field
goal.

In the second half the Spiders
scored first but a running at-

tempt ‘for the PAT failed. Da-
vidson then pushed across two
TD’s in three minutes to open
a seemingly comfortable lead
at 2213. Benson heaved a 25
yard pass to flanker Danny
and Craig
snagged a “Tee” Redding
pitch and slammed over two
Spider defenders for the final
Davidson score.

Richmond took over and
drove 81 yards to a TD on the
phenomenal passing ‘of Dick
Curl and Jerry Landers. The
Cats bogged down when they
got the ball and were forced
to kick, whereupon Richmond
sliced out 80 yards in ecight
plays, almost entirely through
the air, to barge ahead by 27.

The Furman game tomor-
row looms as perhaps one
of the toughest of the sea-
son. The Purple Hurricane
has played such teams as
Penn State, Alabama, and
South Carolina and their
poor 2-7 record is no indica-
tion of their ability. They
boast a potent passing com-
bination in quarterback Bil-
ly Baker and end Ray Si-
minski. Davidson has not
beaten a Furman team in
ten years, losing fast year
by a close 6-2 score.

Dole hopes to have most of

They said it couldn't be

U.N.C. GAME

On Friday, November 14, the
Davidson soccer team clashed
with the University of North
Carolina in what Coach Me-
Cutchan labeled “the hardest
game of the season.” The final
score indicated a 4-1 victory for
UNC. but the showing was any-
thing but discouraging. The ex
ceptional passing and team co-
ordination of the UNC team
were hard to equal.

Dave Irvin scored David-
son's lone point on a drib-
ble and drive in the first
quarter. But UNC retali-
ated with two quick scores
to lead the Wildcats at half
time by a 2-¥ score.

In the second half UNC
picked up two mére points, Da-
vidson failing to score again.
Outstanding in the Davidson
contingent were Finney and
Lint Hopkins, in their respec-
tive positions of goalie and half:
back.
