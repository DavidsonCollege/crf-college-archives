Whitener Speaks At
“Y” Vesper Services

Uses for Subject “A New Order
of Life”

Rev. Milton Whitener, secretary of
Catawba College, opened the vesper
services for the new year by speaking
on the subject, “A New Order of
Life,” taking his text from the twenty-
first chapter of Revelations, the fifth
verse, “Behold, I make all things
new.” Lyne Gamble was in charge
of the service, and Bob Coit led: in
prayer. Joe Dill, accompanied at the
piano by Kenneth Scott, sang “I Come
to Thee” as a solo.

The words of the text, Mr. Whitener
explained, were said to St. John as he
lay imprisoned on the Isle of Patmos,
and signified the freshness of the new
order of life as he beheld it in his
vision of the New World. These words
have especial meaning to us, for ours
is a time of tremendous change—
things are no longer as they were. To
be sure, human nature, sin, the need
for forgiveness, love and faith, are the
same; and still “Hope springs eternal
in the human breast,” yet with it all,
we are new men, for we have a new
knowledge and new needs.

Our problem is different. We have,
through the radio, practically anni-
hilated time and distance. Races are
being made one, and men, as always,
are travelling, but in new ways. New
methods in world industries and busi-
ness, even in government, including

our own, have brought about changes
that many deemed impossible. And to
these problems there are two atti-
tudes which youth may take: that of
fear, and that of faith. The first class
says that we are facing ruin, the
breaking up of all things good. But
such has been the experience of every
new era. So it was with Christ and
His gospel, whose message of good-
will was attacked as an evil that would
turn the world upside down. The sec-
ond class, on the other hand, is made
up of men of faith who have set into
motion forces that-have_lasted through
all history. They believe that God has
His hand in the affairs of men, that
it is not His purpose that this world
should fail.

This new-order calls for a new type
of preacher, for men trained not only
in theology and philosophy, but in life.
Their task has been accentuated by
the nearness of men and the similarity
of their problems, Jesus laid down
the challenge of heroism and courage
and daring adventure in the red-
blooded struggle that must be fought
to solve these problems. Mr, Whitener
suggested. the marshalling of our
forces under-an “ACRA,” a Christian
Recovery Act, in the drive to make
God real to men.

COACH DOC NEWTON
LAUDED BY PAPER

(Continued from page 1)
Then came an opening at Davidson
College in North Carolina and he
grabbed the job right out of the grasp
of a large and widely variegated as-
sortment of candidates. He picked up

Gene McEver, ex-star of Tennessee,
whose home was once tabbed as Avon-
dale, and the pair of them went about
building up a team. So now at the
conclusion of their second term scribes
have branded the Wildcat combination
as one of the greatest in many years
at Davidson. So the genial ‘Doc’ re-
ceived a bonus and a raise.

“While the Davidson team of this
season was forced to accept spots be-
hind Duke and North Carolina in the
‘big five’ race, and a team in 1926 was
accorded the championship, critics
have brought out facts and dope to
show that the 1933 eleven was really
better.

“Among the changes wrought at Da-
vidson by Newton and, McEver was
supremacy over Wake Forest. It had
been nine years since the old rivals of
the Wildcats had been turned back
prior to the advent of Newton, The

tactics that please the crowds.”
Praise also went to Quarterback

Johnny Mackorell, who will captain

next year’s eleven, He was termed

“the greatest back in the Old North

State.”

Luckies

THE TOBACCO
DOES NOT SPILL OUT

Good tobaccos... real good tobaccos... that’s the reason
for Lucky Strike’s fine, smooth quality. We use only
the center leaves of the finest Turkish and domestic to-
bacco plants. Not the top leaves—because those are under-
developed. Not the bottom leaves—because those are in-
ferior in quality. We use only the center leaves—because
these are the mildest leaves—fully ripe for perfect smok-
ing. Only these choice tobaccos are used to make Luckies
—so round, 'so firm, so fully packed—and no loose ends
to spill out. That’s why Luckies are always mild and
smooth. That’s why always ‘‘Luckies please”. And don’t
forget—‘‘It’s toasted’’—for throat protection—for finer taste.
