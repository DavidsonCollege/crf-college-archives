S.P.E.’s to Retain
Harper Trophy
In Scholarship

Sigma Phi Epsilon Attains High-
est Average Recorded in
Fourteen Years

BETAS ARE SECOND

System of Grading Changed to
Alphabetical Basis

Sigma Phi Epsilon | won first place
among. the social fraternities at David-
son in scholastic averages during the
1932-33 session to retain the Harper
trophy for the second consecutive year,
according to a statement made public
by F. W. Hengeveld, registrar, Mon-
day. The Sig Eps held an average of
2.482 to lead the Betas by .355 points.

Last year Sigma Phi Epsilon, which
is Davidson’s youngest fraternal group,
averaged 88.14. per cent to earn one
year’s possession of the Harper cup
for the first time.

This year the system of grading was
changed from a numerical to an alpha-
betical basis. In compiling the results,
Registrar Hengeveld assigned to an
“A plus” the value of 3.5; an “A,”
30; a “B plus” 2.5; a “B,” 20; a “C
plus,” 1.5; a “C,” 1.03; and a “D,” .5.

The winner’s average, according to
Hengeveld, was the highest that had
been recorded by a social group since
he assumed his position here fourteen
years ago.

Members of the Sig Ep Chapter
which accumulated the high average
include: Class of ’33—C. E. Bettis, F.
H. Bixler, H. K. Boucher, R. E. Con-
oley, S. V. Daniel, Jr., F. L. Elvery,
C. L. Howard, H. Morrison, A. Patton,
Jr., and E. W. Shackelford; Class of
‘34—J. T. Blair, O. Casali, J. H. Fitz-
gerald, C. F. Gold, Jr., H. M. Hawkins,
E. J. Humphrey, J. A. Hunter, E. C.
Snead; Class of '35—D. B. Elvery, S.
GF Henry, WI. Morris, C. S, MeCall,
Jr., T. D. Miller, R. M. Porter, J. H.
IPod A. C. Roger; Class of ’36—M.
J. Barnett, G. P. Erwin, J. W. Knox,
A. L. Murray, W. R. Satterfield, C. G.

Smith.

The Betas showed the greatest
amount of improvement among the ten
social fraternities, moving from eighth
place a year ago to second place in
the standings this year.

Gridgraph Board Proves Success;
Offers Thrill to Large Throng

Machine Installed in Shearer Hall Will Give Davidson Students
and Townspeople Comprehensive Accounts: of All Out-
of-Town Football Games ‘in Which Davidson
Participates

While the team was fighting a glo-
rious. battle on enemy territory, two
hundred and fifty loyal Wildcat sup-
porters gathered in Shearer Hall last
Saturday afternoon to watch the prog-
ress of the game throtigh the medium
of the newly installed Gridgraph. This
clever machine was purchased from
the company bearing the same name
as its product by the college at a cost
of $425.00, and has been set up in
Shearer Auditorium with Heath Whit-
tle in charge. :

The apparatus consists of a minia-
ture field made of green mesh marked
off in proportionate ten-yard lines sur-
rounded by the opposing line-ups on
either side, and below it are the pos-
sible results of any play. Each player
and each result has its corresponding
light which is flashed on at the proper
time.

Two red lights, one on the left and
the other on the right, indicate which

team has the ball, and a third red
light is turned on to represent the
touchdowns. The mesh is transparent
enough for a small extension bulb to
shine through and represent the ball.
Each play is transmitted by Western
Union to a branch office located in
the off-stage wings of the hall and
from there to the manipulators of the
board.

There are fifty switches that lead to,
the various bulbs and it takes five op-
erators to manage them. In this, Whit-
tle was assisted by
Dudley Elvery, Lanier Pratt, C. C.
Quick, and Bob Woodside. Mr. Aber-
nathy, at the wires, was assisted by |
Polk Moffett:

An admission fee of fifteen cents |
was charged to students, and a fee of
twenty-five cents to townspeople, from
which a total of $40.00 was collected. |
This goes toward defraying the ex-
penses of the board and operators.

Mr. Ovens Addresses

Those who attended the last Y. M.
A. vesper services had the privilege
hearing Mr. David Ovens, general
manager Ivey’s Department Store
of Charlotte. Mr. Ovens is no stran-
wer to Davidson students, having
spoken here many times during the
past several years. As in former years,
his audience was much impressed with
his ability as a speaker.

services and Robert Woodside and
Arno!d Rhodes led in prayer. The mu-
sical feature of the evennig was a clari-
net solo by Harris Bradley,
panied at the piano by Kenneth Scott.

Mr. Ovens’ subject for the evening
was “ Placing the Emphasis.” He spoke
of the tendency of the American peo-
ple to place more emphasis on things

of this world rather than spiritual
things.. As an example he cited the
case of more emphasis being placed
on the Midway at the Century of

Progress Exposition than on the sci-
entific _and_other educational exhibits.

“T once attended a large church in
“New York,” said Mr. Ovens, “which
was equipped with the
and had the most wonderful choir I
had ever seen, But there were so few
people in attendance that I thought I
had made a mistake. about the hour.”
He went on to Say that in the same city
he attended a theater where tickets
were selling at four dollars apiece. The
place was packed and jammed with
standing room only available. It was
self-evident where this emphasis was
being placed. «° {

Collegiate Digest is a section exactly

editorial content to pictures that deal
with the life and activities of college
and university students throughogt the
