Davidson’s Past

Graduate Scholarship Record

Is Good; But Students Ave Failing To Take
Advantage Of An Exceptional Opportunity

Davidson College is justly proud of
the record which its alumni have made in
graduate and professional schools. The
number of Rhodes Scholarships and Full-
bright Fellowships won by Davidson men
for study abroad is particularly gratifying.
Last year’s senior class distinguished itself
by the large number of scholarships and
fellowships for graduate study which were
awarded to its members, among these two
Woodrow Wilson Fellowships and two
Danforth Foundation Fellowships won in
the face of very stiff national competition.
No other college or university surpassed
Davidson's record in these two competi-
tions although several equalled Davidson’s
record.

There is every evidence that the
number of Davidson men winning gradu-
ate fellowships could be greatly increased
if more Davidson students were willing to

apply for such opportunities and to plan .

their choice of courses more carefully to

Two Month Orientation

prepare them for graduate study. Each
year the Faculty Committee on Graduate
Scholarships receives many more requests
to nominate students for fellowships car-
rying substantial stipends than there are
interested students. This reverses the situ-
ation which existed before the war.

In order to bring pertinent informa-
tion to the seniors and to stimulate the
interest of other classes in the possibility
of graduate study,.the DAVIDSONIAN
plans to publish regularly announcements
of the more attractive graduate scholar-
ships and fellowships for which Davidson
students are eligible. Meanwhile we com-
mend the untiring efforts of the Faculty
Committee on Graduate Scholarships (Pro-
fessors Abernethy, Cumming, Gallent and
Watts) to assist and counsel students seek-
ing graduate awards. Here is one area of
faculty-student relations in which the fac-
ulty has gone more than half way!

Gives Frosh

Better Idea Of Davidson and College Life

Like it or not, Davidson is faced with
a real problem in its rate of freshman mor-
tality. Each year the general exodus at the
semester points to two things: One, that
Davidson is academically hard as nails, and
two, that many freshmen either do not re-
alize this or have not been sufficiently
oriented to the idea to apply themselves
to college work.

It is therefore with great foresight
and wisdom that the College has this year
instituted a prolonged orientation program
for the freshmen. Subject as is any new
system to a certain number of unavoid-
able rough spots which must eventually

Is Davidson

There are virtues of a small college
and virtues of a large university. These
virtues are not the same and decisions
with respect to which type of institution
is chosen should be made with the differ-
ences in mind. Recently, Hamilton Col-
lege, a liberal arts institution for men in
the state of New York, undertook a study
to determine as nearly as possible where
the dividing line lay. Hamilton wanted to
remain a small college but it was pressed
for admissions. The published results of
the study read, in part:

“Institutional decision in such a mat-
ter can seldom be made solely on the basis
of curricular or academic criteria. Such
mundane matters as adequacy of the wat-
er supply may be relevant. The budget is
not unimportant, and there are intangible
but proper concerns for the character of
campus life which a change in enrollment
may affect.

“The study was therefore divided in-
to three parts. A survey of the business

be smoothed, the new system nevertheless
meets a real need in keeping before the
freshmen during their first two months
here the fact that they must adjust them-
selves to a new type existance, that, so to
speak, of a bookworm.

The proof of this pudding will not be
in the eating. Anyone can easily see its
value, and if the freshman mortality and
malajustment rate this year is not lower
than in previous years, it will be the result
of closed ears and minds on the part of
the freshmen, not of failure on the part of
the College to offer all the help possible.

Gargantuan?

management of the College was made by
professional consultants who estimated an
optimal enrollment in terms of plant and
-budgetary considerations. A faculty com-
mittee on student activities was asked to
discuss the relation of enrollment to stu-
dent-student and student-faculty acquain-
tance and friendship, the sense of corpor-
ate unity, and the extra-curricular activity
of the student. The Committee on Studies
of the Faculty undertook the most diffi-
cult task of studying the general question
in relation to the central academic task of
the College. Would academic efficiency be
affected in the event enrollment changed?

“Fortunately, the three separate stu-
dies pointed to a common answer.”

If seven hundred and fifty is the op-
timum number for a small college, as the
Hamilton study indicates, Davidson Col-
lege, which now has eight fifty, is on the
verge of failure with respect to the virtues
of the ‘Small College.”

Salute To The Little Fellow

One of the most exciting college foot-
ball games we have seen in the last ten
years was played by two teams that would
never have ranked in the top 150, in a sta-
dium that consisted of some weather-beat-
en wooden bleachers propped against a
colorful New England hillside. We don’t
recall the name of the player who scored
the winning touchdown in the last 15 sec-
onds; his name would mean something to
his classmates but he never made All-New
England or Little All-America or anything
else. Yet he provided us with one of the
greatest thrills we have had watching foot-
ball games (and we include Army-Notre
Dame, Southern Cal-UCLA, Penn-Cornell,
Alabama-Tennessee, etc.).

But these small colleges—and there
are hundreds of them—provide as many
thrills to as many fans as do the relatively

few big-time teams that dominate the na-
tional scene. And these little fellows are
just as important to football as the top-
ranking conference leaders or the choices
for the major bowl games on New Year's
Day.

Probably they are more important.
Because they come a lot closer to reflect-
ing the spirit in which the game was origi-
nated in this country. Football was once
designed to be played by students simp-
ly for the exercise and fun they got out of
it, remember?

As the 1954 football season gets un-
der way, we salute . . . small colleges that
believe playing the game on a modest,
amateur scale is much better than not
playing the game at all.

Oceans Of Red Tape

Secretivness Separates

A sharp blow and a premature
wind storm began the harvest of
the fall and an immediate distine-
tion between liberal arts and other
activities has, at the outset of the
school year, been established.

With the return of the students
to subdue their intellectual tendan-
cies also returned the ancient In-
quisition. This sentiment was felt
in the past weck when the raging
Order of the Davidsonian (other-
wise known as the Student Council)
sought to carry out, define, and de-
nounce the title; “an honorable
man.” The absence of the dull
monk's cloth was replaced by a
“tunica molesta” — a shirt of fire
—but the circumstances were re-
versed from what the natural reac-
tion would be.

These “tunics,” as we shall call
them, were smeared with the in-
flammable materials of pride and
suspicion, awkwardness and singu-
larity; a chemical composition
which burst into a dull glow at the
slightest contact with the outer
world, and where upon returning
to the dark abyss of secretivencss
the flame raged with ravenous in-
tensity.

Bananas And Gin

These enclosed activities serve
only one purpose in this case; they
increase the imaginatiori and also
shock an established opinion. But
on the other hand if the imagina-
tion had -been a reality and the es-
tablished opinion had been valid’
then there would not have been
the hushed rumors or the silent
wishes appearing in a subtle plot
to dissolve our powerful machine—
the Student Council.

The Student Council should be
able to see that the students’ faces
are bright with interest, and they
would like to know a little more
than a casual announcement two or
three days after the storm of the

Letter To Editor

purge has lost its fury. It is almost
as if a case that is tried, shipped,
and discussed; and later the mem-
bers of the “Star Chamber” sit
smugly by and await the reaction of
the student -body.

The folly in the whole thing is
that they know perfectly well the
reaction that will follow and per-
haps have that same sentiment
themselves. When a word unbecom-
ing to a Davidson gentleman arises
from amidst the ranks they lift
their eyebrows and scoff; some ev-
en to the point of seeing the stu-
dent who audibly expressed a sur-
pressed majority opinion packing
his bag and making his exit with
the others.

Crowns’ Legal System

Before 17176 a policy of the
Crown's legal system was to ship
more extreme court cases to Eng-
land for a hearing. The closed door
of the Student Council Chamber is
much like the Atlantic Ocean: Wo,
the colonists, are separated from
our court by an ocean of difuse red
tape and smug secretiveness.

The colonists resented their situa-
tion; we resent ours. The colonists
had a revolution. We tried last year
with constitutional amendments
but the Crown was too strong for
us and constant postponement of
the corrective issue became mil-
dewed and dusty in the dome of
Chambers.

Our probiem is the stolid conser-
vatism! We have let our shallow
motto become—“A safe place for
your son.” If the trend continues as
it has in the past, we shall look
back on our four substanceless
years with puny nastalgia and
scraps of gathered knowledge.

If we shake off our drowsiness
and rise from our sacks to feed on
a good breakfast of nourishing re-
form we shall have a good start on
this morning of our lives.

Student Council Secrecy

Scored; Publicity Urged

Dear Editor:

In view of the recent case before
the student council and secrecy
shrouding the true facts of the case,
and in the light of the fact that in
most cases which come before the
council many rumors are gencrat-
ed because of the lack of facts all
of which, in my opinion, leads to
more damage to character than an
official statement would, I would
like to add my appeal to those of
many others who are seeking a
measure requiring the Student
Council to make public a report on
all cases which come before the
body.

I propose that this report be in
the form of a short article which
would be published during the
week of the case in an inconspicu-
ous place in the DAVIDSONIAN.
It should be only a summary of
pertinent facts and would not

necessarily have to mention names.
If something similar to this were
done I think that it would greatly
raise student interest in the work
of the Council and improve cooper.
ation between the two bodies.
—Tom Morgan

FACULTY
ARTICLES

The Davidsonian wishes to reiter-
ate its invitation, made at the close
of the past year, for articles from
members of. the faculty. These ar-
ticles should be on matters of cur-
rent interest to the student body.
The submission of these articles
will continue to be voluntary in
nature. All such will be welcomed.

ism Again!

Davidson May Be Nearing The
Students and Council Dawn In Three Important Areas

BY JOE GARRISON

Many persons seriously con-
cerned about the improvement of
several features of Davidson life
which have been criticized edi-
torially, in student bull sessions,
and from other higher circles for
the past several years are begin-
ning to be cautiously hopeful that
this year will see definite progress
in these areas.

Schoo! Spirit

In the first place the Davidson
Wildcats are growling out on the
gridiron after a disturbing slumber
last year with two victories already
under their belts. Despite all at-
tempts to awaken school spirit it
is very difficult when the team is
competing against schools like
Georgia Tech which are so far out
of its class that the possibility of
an upset win is about as probable
as the Southern Presbyterian Jour-
nal changing their editorial posi-
tion on the union question.

School spirit is always difficult
to define, but it is obvious that
there is a great deal of it when
our team is winning and not too
much when it. is winless as last
year. The game with Citadel to-
morrow provides a tough challenge
for the team; although we are fully
confident of victory number three,
if we do lose it why not still show
the team they have our support
by giving them a rousing midnight
welcome again? When we can do
this we will really know the. true
meaning of school spirit.

Chapel

Another beam of light is appear-
ing in the chapel situation, which
has developed in the last several
years into a major source of em-
-barrassment to the school. Indeed,
last spring the conduct of the stu-
dents reached new heights of
crudeness and ill manners so that
any speaker was liable to be
pounced on by a wild pack of
coughing cats known enigmatically

enough as “Davidson gentlemen.”

To emphasize the seriousness of
the problem, Dr. Cunningham
spoke at length on the second day
of the semester on it and showed

The Sotirizer

By GILBERT GRAGG

that some intelligent and far-
reaching thinking had been done
on it during the summer by the
faculty committee.
The abolishing of Monday
chapel in fevor of emphasizing

8 better quality of programs on

the other four days was very

wise and was greeted by the
students with enthusiasm.

Dr. Cunningham went ahead to
stress how much better behavior
would mean to him personally and
suggested that we all work on the
problem with a mutual degree of
harmony and understanding of
what it would mean to the college.
For the first week many students
as well as administration members
held their breaths daily in chapel
hoping fervently for signs of im-
provement; generally everyone
seemed pleased with the courtesy
shown Dr. Hall and the silent at-
tention ,given announcements the
first week.

It was a trembling hope for
many who feared everyone was
only sleepy from rush week, and
this week some are already ‘point-
ing to the outburst of “clicks”
which accompanied the Camera
Club announcement Tuesday (most-
ly sophomores!) and the sudden
outburst of coughing in chapel
Wednesday. But encouragingly
these were mild compared with
what it has been in the past, and
there are high hopes among most
students that 1954 will see the end
of this problem. Only time. will
tell, but if we can field a winning
football team surely we can de-
feat this source of. embarrassment
to the school.

The Student Constitution

The third and most promising
glitter of light at the beginning of
this new term concerns the Student
Council and the scraping of the
old constitution. 1t has long been
suggested that this was needed.
and at no time was it more ob.
vious than last Friday when the
president of the student body read
some of the out-dated rules includ-

ing “. .. no student shall be guilty.

of selling a girl’s football ticket
either to another student or to an
outsider,” which justly provoked
ludicrous reactions from the stu-
dents.

It is heartening to the student
body to know that their trusted
representatives are now meeting in
various committees to give the
school a completely new constitu.
tion that will be clear and mean-
ingful in cases where it is now
irrelevant or difficult to interpret.
Such questions being considered
are the responsibilities of testi-
mony regarding infractions of the
student regulations, some actual re-
vision of the student body rule on
drinking which has long been over-
due, in the opinion of many, and
also the muck discussed question
of the difference between being
honor bound to report someone
for an infraction of the rules as a
Student Council member under
oath or duty bound according to
the dictates of your own con-
Science as a student at Davidson.

Is there really a difference? The
new constitution will be written,
advance reports indicate, so that it
will be acceptafle to the majority
of the faculty amd students and
trustees which will be a difficult
but commendable undertaking. Let
us hope that the succeeding years
of Davidson students will look back
on this school year with pride and
satisfaction at the new constitution
which was drawn up and passed
this year.

It is too early in the school year
to be unrealistically optimistic
abvout these three factors of David-
son life. But certainly it is not too
yoon to be indulging in wishful
thinking that this year will mark
the birth of a new spirit among
the student body in supporting al!
athletic teams, win or lose, that the
students will act rationally. with

higher standards of decency and
better chapel manners and that
finally the Student Council will
present a workable, reasonable, and
fair constitution for adoption.

CERTAIN ATTITUDES ARE ESSENTIAL

TO ALL TO WHOM THESE
PRESENTS MAY COME, GREET-
INGS:

Whereas, there is only one time
in life when a young man passes
through an institution of higher
learning, Le., a collegé or univer-
sity, and whereas one owes it to
himself and to society to burgeon
out the very best of which one is
capable of becoming so that he may
pay his full debt to his heirs and
assigns, therefore, I do hereby set
apart for your deepest considera-
tion and application certain funda-
mental attitudes and requirements
which, if dutifully adhered to, will
insure more than ordinary success
and satisfaction in your intellec-
tual, pursuits: To Wit:

1. Never take your studies ser-

tously. This is the first rule of suc:
cess and achievement. Why waste
time and effort on. such frivolous
matters? Be A Man About Town!
2. Be an individualist and a free
thinker. If the profgssor holds ta
ideas different from your own, dis-
agree openly and vehemently. Af-
ter all, he doesn’t ‘have the last
word on truth. Perhaps he has had
many years of study and exper-
ience, but it may al! be a vast store
of prejudice and misinformation.
3. Ignore all schoo! customs and
traditions. Why should you follow
certain practices simply because it
has been done for a hundred or so
years? This is a new age and make
the most of it! It may not be the
popular course to travel, but now

is the time to stand up for your

MY OWN STORY: A QUESTION OF

By BILL SCHOLL

Constitution of the Student
Government of Davidson Col-
lege:

Articie 8, Section 2: No. stu-
dent shall be guilty of ...
having same (alcoholic liquors)
in his possession, on the cam-
pus.

Section tI: it shall be the
duty of every student to report
immediately all violations of
this Article which come under
his observation.

I entered Davidson College in
September, 1952, as a member of
the sophomore class. Of the things
constituting an education, ! placed
near the top of my list further de-
velopment of ethical values — in-
cluding such things as honesty.

Since my arrival I have heard
much of the student body's respon-
sibility for self-government and
seen little in practice. I have been
willing to assume that the lack of
evidence of such student responsi-
bility was as much my fault as it
was anyone else’s. Therefore I de-
termined to make a conscious ef-
fort myself to live as a member of
the student body and subject to
its regulations, and to encourage
others to do so; I ask you to see
what has happened.

“I based this outlook primarily on
a single foundation. That founda-
tion is that I entered Davidson Col-

lege realizing fully that I must
abide by such rules as had been
put into effect by all who govern
this institution — trustees, admin-
istration, faculty, student govern-
ment. This did not mean that 1
felt I must blindly follow such
rules, and should not be so inter-
preted.

At any time that I felt a particu-
lar law was unjust, I felt that I had
the right and the duty to confer
with others interested and see what
could be done to change it if the
change was for the good of the
institution as a whole. Recognizing
this right of expression and per-
mission to work to improve certain
matters (though even this power at
times seems impotent), I agreed to
myself to abide by the rules of the
group under whose instruction I
put myself. I felt that every mem-
ber of the student body must have
essentially that same spirit, or the
laws would be farcical. The fact of
how farcical they are has been am-
ply demonstrated during the past
week,

Events Of The Week-End

1 am sure that most Davidson
personnel are familiar by now with
the events of the past Sunday and
Monday, whether in some distorted
fashion or not. I daresay that not a
member of these personnel feels
that the accused student was in-
nocent of the charge of possessing
liquor on the campus. (No charge

was made concerning the student’s
drinking on the ride back, as some
have erroneously thought; was
not an issue.) The Student Council
heard the case fairly and declared
the student guilty, on the basis of
his own confession.

When the students arrived at the
campus last Sunday night and I
suggested that the liquor be dis-
posed of because of the relevant
rule, my suggestion was laughing-
ly put aside.°When this matter
came up tater, I was told that the
students had no idea: 1) that I was
serious in cautioning them about
the violation of the “drinking
rule”; and 2) that I would report
the violation. This is an explicit
example of how poorly we students
look at each other's responsibility
in this business of governing our-
selves.

I was under no obligation to sug-
gest that the liquor be disposed of;
I did this simply hoping that the
suggestion would be taken. When I
made this suggestion, I was not
completely sure what course of ac-
tion to take. The more I thought of
the case, the surer I became that
a clear violation had occurred.

I reported the violation Monday
afternoon, after careful delibera-
tion Monday morning. I felt abso-
lutely no obligation to overlook
this offense because I had been
picked up by these students; when
I entered the car, I did not leave

behind my obligation as a member
of this student body.

What happened after the trial
and conviction of the student to
whom the liquor belonged? Hot-
headed emotion seized many of the
characters involved in the incident.
Fortunately the two students who
had ridden in the car with the sus-
pended one and myself regained
their reasonableness and talked to
me quite. openly. soon after the
trial. This I appreciated very much
and feel that much more mature
wisdom would have been shown if
the other main character had done
likewise, instead of reverting to
force to “prove” his point.

The main incident is over. I sin-
cerely hope that the student sus-
pended wilt come to the point at
which he realizes that the only
course to be taken was pursued.
But what of attitudes on the cam-
pus after this event?

I ask each reader of this article,
in the Davidson personnel, to ex-
amine what his reaction was, when
and if he learned of this incident.
A few have come to me and _ said
they agreed that I could have done
no other. The vast majority have
not kept silent, but have rather
voiced their disapproval by stony
stares and open obscenities hurled
at me.

What does bother me now, how.
ever, and what should bother you,
is that I question the principle

* rights,

4. Do not waste valuable time in
the sack, Science has long since
disproved the theory that a certain
amount of sleep and rest are neces-
sary for physical and mental health.
Things happen after the weak have
retired. Who wants to sleep his
life away?

5. Date constantly, fervently,
and energetically. Here is the thing
that counts for all in college. Date
every night. Ignore distances where
a good date is involved. Cut as
many classes as necessary. THIS IS
THE LIFE!

6. Put Self shove everything

tion to your associates only when
it will enhance your own position.

—Ye Olde Scribe

ETHICS

that there is to be found here the
growth of ethical values in the stu-
dent body on the large scale that
is generally thought of by the pub.
lic. To the person who honestly
considers what my duty was when
I came in contact with a violation
of the drinking rule (a rule which —
particularly should be in the minds
of many because of last year's epi-
sode along this line), I ask: How
far are you in developing a mature
concept of governing yourself?
Before we demand more student-
governmental powers, I suggest
that we see exactly what we are
doing with those we have. As long
as the Student Council is regarded
as a police force and no other mem-
bers of the student body are ex-
pected to be responsible, the scene
will continue its downward path.
Every member of the student
body must do in a situation like
this what he feels to be that which
is most in harmony with the Chris-
tian faith, if he considers himself
a Christian. I have done what
seems to me to be the best thing
for all concerned. If I am ever the
subject of a violation of the gov-
ernment under which I have put
myself, i.e., Davidson College, I
shall expect to be dealt with in
like manner — which is only fair.
If I violate such a rule, I pray’ I
would have the strength to turn
myself in without cotnsidering be-
ing “caught”; if I did not, I would
expect others to do that for me.
