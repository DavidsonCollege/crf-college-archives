Hard Winter Season

GUEST COLUMNIST—JACK ABERNATHY

If Toni’s reader happens to look over the usual slot this week,
hoping against hope, perhaps he'll receive a pleasant shock to discover
that he will get some relief, for this week at least. This is the better
half of 104 West, trying to give you in this small space a birds-eye view
of the sports domain as it appears to the slightly inexperienced eye of
a sport’s writer's room-mate.

And so now Southern California gets to take a crack at mighty
Duke's spotless record. The once powerful and awe-inspiring Trojans
have already fallen beneath the scalping knife twice, and from this
distance looks as though the Fighting Irish are,due to tumble them
again. On paper, therefore Duke should hold the edge, but “we” just
can’t see the Devils as a scoring machine, and they will be hard put to
to hold down the top-flight Trojans. All evidence to the contrary, I'll
take Duke.

Speaking of machines, The Deacons from over Wake Forest way
really flashed one on our ‘Cats that rainy Thanksgiving—
remember? To me, that’s the story in a nutshell—our boys had the
Will, but they simply couldn't match the smooth-functioning power of
the Baptists. And thus we come to the close of another season of that
glorious, glamorous, color-filled pageant crammed with heart-breaks and
heart-throbs, hard knocks and hard smashes, and known in the vernacu-
lar as football. '

dauntless

While the memories of the past season are still fresh, and specula-
tion runs riot on the prospects for next year's team, it might be well
to look at the “killer” schedule lined up for the coming hopefuls. With
ten of the starting lineup graduating come June, and only_a crop of un-
tried sophomores to augment the thin line of juniors and seniors, next
year’s edition of Wildcats will really have a problem on their hands.

To me it will always be a never-ceasing miracle, and perhaps an
explanation of that hoary about the Wildcat spirit, how
Davidson teams can face the tough schedules that they do year after
year, and still turn out such creditable records as the Fighting ‘Cats
have always managed to do. Though it may be sentimental, and
though it may show an appalling lack of football knowledge, I say
Hats Off! to the whole Wildcat crew—to the players who sacrificed a
valuable part of their lives in hard practice and tougher games and to
the coaches who guide them with all their time and energies.

With the donning of overcoats, mufflers, gloves, the first biting winds
of. winter and its accompaning snows, and the inevitable shifting of the
sport's scene to the indoors, comes the eternal question—What kind of
basketball team are we going to have this year? As has been said
countless times before, with four of last year's flashing regulars re-
turning—Captain Iverson, “Footsie” Cowan, J. D. Hicks, and Johnny
Tice—and with a wealth of excellent and seasoned subs from last year's

question

superb edition back, the basketeers should really have a good season
this year, and here’s wishing them all luck,

An Amateur's Jottings From the Cuff: Why didn’t Wake Forest
play their “powerhouse” Powers in his regular slot at tackle against us?
“The straight dope’ seems to be that Powers has been ineligible all
season, tind that Davidson pointed out the fact to Wake Forest officials
before the game. They agreed to, and did, keep him out of the game
with—us. However the point remains that all their other opponents,
according to rules, can claim a win by forfeit... Among the other little
sung sports closing very successful seasons withthe onrush of winter
are Cross Country, with Captain Dave Woodward and “ Walker
flashing in fine style as usual despite injuries, and Soccer, with’ two
games left to finish the season out. And both sports deserve
more student support than they. will probably ever receive .. . Remem-
ber, they do it for sheer love of the game Time for picking
all-star teams is at hand again, so send ig all the ballots and you too can
help boost the Wildcat’s stock. Captain Dave Warden and Slashing
Bill Johnston deserve, along with the rest of the team, all the support
you can give them... Here I am at the end of my rope, and I've

Duke Sweeps
State Crown

Duke’s men-of-iron finished a bril-

untied, and unscored-on to add to
their championships of the South-
ern Conferenté and Big Five.”

Aided by Eric (the Red) Tipton’s
accurately long toe they played
for breaks and defeated the once
invincible Pittsburgh Panthers on a
snow-covered field in Durham as
Bolo Purdue crashed through to
block Chickerneo’s punt behind the
goal.

Carolina, having finished their
schedule, remained in second place,
as did State in third place.

Major game of the Big Five was
the Davidson-Wake Forest clash in
Charlotte on Thanksgiving which
the Deacons took 21-0 as both
teams played poorly on a sloppy
field. ©

Wake Forest's flaming saphomores

conquered a stubborn Davidson
Wildcat eleven by the score of 21-0
on the Memorial stadium turf in
Charlotte in théir annual Thanks-
giving classic.

A cold drizzle that continued
throughout most of the game failed
to slow up the hard running Dea-
con back that performed before
a crowd of about 6,500. They scor-
ed touchdowns in each of the first
three quarters on runs of 2, 14 and
30 yards through the Davidson team.

Only once did the ’Cats seriously
threaten to score, and that was in
the last quarter when with ama-
tuers dotting the Deacon lineup
they passed and ran to the Wake
Forest 15 yard line, but there they
were held on downs.

First Score

Wake Forest set Davidson on
their heels the very first play of
the game by kicking to the goal
line, and Davidson returned to its
15 yard stripe. There Tubby Hand
plunged into the line, but he did
not come up with the ball, because
fullback Marshall Edwards had
wrestled the ball from him. Then
on two plays the Deacons marched

a yard, then, Tony Gallovich, sen-

als To
Be Postponed

Due to continued cold weather
causing bad playing conditions, the
annual Fall: Tennis Tournament has
not been completed as yet.

Manager Ken Lawson -did not
think that the finals could be play-
ed off anytime soon. Tenney and
Shore are the finalists for the var-
sity and John Crichton and Coker
the freshman finalists:

Indefinite postponement of both
play-offs was necessitated when
rain and cold weather so softened
the courts as to make them unfit for
tournament play.

A great many frosh hopefuls were
uncovered by this year’s yearling
tourney, many of them showing real
potentialities. Although the varsity
prowess was more .or less known
before the play started, it gave the
upperclassmen added seasoning and

sational running back, took the ball
on a reverse and scooted off-
tackle behind perfect blocking to
score.

Bill Davis and Gallovich engaged
in a neat punting duel during the
rest of the quarter, but early in the
second quarter the Deacons start-
eda drive after one of Davis’ boots
fell dead on the Wake 49. Edwards
and Gallovich combined with Red
Mayberry, another Sophomore to
march down to the ‘Cat 30. Then
Mayberry took the ball on a half-
spinner and went off right tackle
for 30 yards through the Davidson
team to score. As in the other case
Gallovich kicked the extra point.
