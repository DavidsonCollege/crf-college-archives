Environmental Tip of the Week

-intelligible, sensible, do-able and slightly incon-
venient ideas for the Davidson College Student:

Have you ever looked in a Chamber’s trash
can? If you have, you probably saw a pile of re-
cyclable beverage containers. We drink enough
O.J. and caffeinated drinks to accumulate large
numbers of containers after just 2 to 3 class peri-
ods. By the end of the day, we’ve produced
much more. Hey, don’t waste these containers
any longer! Recycle them! Instead of throwing
that can, glass bottle, or plastic container into a
Chamber’s trash can, carry it to a campus recy-
cling center and deposit it. These centers are
found on each residence hall, and in the Union.
It is not heavy, and if you drink all of the con-
tainer’s contents, it is not too messy to carry in
your bag or pocket. Think about it, then do it --
in Chambers, and other buildings as well!

You may ask why recycling containers are not
in Chambers? Well, containers would need
monitoring daily, and at present the recycling
committee does not have the man-power re-
quired for this operation.
