The Davidsonian

Minor Sports Feel Monetary Squeeze

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

(Ed. Note: This is the fourth
in the series concerning David-
son's crisis in athletics. It deals
with the ‘‘minor’' sports
program here. Though this
term will be used throughout
the ensuing article, the sports
staff does not consider any
sport to be inferior to another as
we try to provide adequate
coverage for all athletic com-
petition at Davidson. This story
will try to analyse the role of
minor sports in Davidson's total
athletic picture, as well as the
financial difficulty that they are
facing.)

There seems to be a problem
arising in Davidson athletics
which the financial wizards of
this college are either ignoring
with the hope that no one will
notice it. or forgetting with the
total lack of money to solve it.

Essentially. the problem is
that very few of the sports at
Davidson have enough money
to compete in high-grade com-
petition.

Davidson fields 10 minor
sports, i.e. sports which receive
no scholarship aid. These in-
clude tennis, track, golf,
baseball, wrestling, swimming,
soccer, sailing, rifling and cross
country. There are a great
many student-athletes who par-
ticipate in these activities every
year.

At this point, most of these
teams have very little money to
maintain a decent schedule,
much less provide for other
necessary facilities.

Consider the following five

sports to be a reasonable cross
séction of these sports in the en-

track, soccer, baseball and
Sailing.

Jeff Frank, the recently ap-
pointed head tennis coach, ex-
plained part of the situation
from his viewpoint.

“‘We are not going to be able
to compete in the Southern Con-
ference much longer if we do
not begin to put a little more
financial support into the
program here,” he said.

“Scholarships are just one
aspect of the problem. There
are the other expenses that we
will feel a tight squeeze on

On the scholarship issue, it
was revealed that in the SC
alone, five of the seven other
member schools have or are
getting some scholarship aid for
tennis.

Furman has two and one-half
scholarships, while William and
Mary has two or two and one-
half, and The Citadel has some.

East Carolina, which grants

varisty sports, will have some
very soon in tennis.

The big concern of the con-
ference is that Appalachian is
working with an _ almost
unlimited supply of money as
far as offering aid is concerned.

‘‘In two or three years, the
conference will be no more than
a fight for second, since they
will have so much money in ten-
nis.” sighed Frank. *‘No one
will be able to compete with
them.”

It is believed that the Moun-
taineers will have either seven
or eight tennis players on
scholarship aid next vear.

Frank explained that when he
plaved for the Cats. no one had
scholarships except George
Washington, who has _ since
withdrawn from the con-
ference. But now ‘‘almost
everyone has them.”’

“] think that ASU will be
using the maximum number of
scholarships allowed by the
NCAA and the conference in all
sports.” Frank said. ‘There
will definitely be a drastic
change in the conference."

Frank is not even sure that
two scholarships for the Cats
will be enough to keep pace with
Appalachian. But it does seem
high time that the trustees and
administration see fit to put
money where it is direly
needed, before it is too late and
Davidson is too far behind.

‘‘We already face problems in
other areas,’’ claimed Frank.

He noted the loss of two highly
touted prospects. One went to
Princeton because he wanted
the quality of an Ivy League

scholarships.

“If we went all out on our
facilities, then I think it would
be impressive enough to get
some quality track men to

Davidson,"' he said.

A new track is a_ big
possibility, sjnce the J. P.
Stevens company may use

Davidson as a test sight for a
newly developed all-weather
track

“This would be great.” ex-
plained Martin. “It would be a
big recruiting help since almost
all the other schools have some
sort of all weather track
already. We need it also
because we cannot host the SC
Tournament without one.”

He feels the equipment aspect
of track is hurting too. The team
gets about $1428 for this pur-
pose. This will hardly provide
the team members with shoes
and uniforms.

The team has yet to get the

money for a water jump
which is used in_ the
steeplechase event.

“It looks to me like if you
aren't going to give a guy a
scholarship for playing, you
could at least provide some
good facilities for him,"’ Martin
Stated.

“I think we could be com-
petitive if we could just get
enough money to get the
facilities we need to attract per-
formers. As of now, we have no
leeway whatsoever. We are
stretched to the penny."’

He gave an example that he
could skimp on gas mileage
only because some of the
players drove for very little

“The costs of equipment alone is going to pul pressure on us: not

just tennis etther,

education.

Another is headed for a Ten-
nessee school because his
family cannot afford the high
costs of a Davidson education.

So the problem keeps growing
and growing, while the college
does very little to counter it.

Sterling Martin, head coach
for track and cross country, finds
the problem to be very ‘‘ex-
pensive.”

“We have 30 to 35 people to
transport to and from meets,”’
he said. ‘‘Our money allotted
for expenses ($3039) helps, but
it leaves little room for any
creativity at all,” hesaid.

The team cannot schedule
any new matches due to a lack
of money.

“When we want to get a new
opponent,”’ he continued, ‘‘we
usually have to play them away
the first time. We just don’t
have the money.”

Martin went further to outline
one possible way to get quality

compensation to cover ex-
penses.

“Our budget is just not
keeping pace with the rising
costs of equipment main-
tenance, much less the amounts
that other schools are putting
‘into their programs,” he ex-
pressed.

William and Mary provides
scholarship aid in track. It is no
coincidence that they are the SC
powerhouse in this sport.

Obviously there is a great
lack in the funding of track
which adds condiderably to the
problem at hand.

Soccer has just acquired a
new head coach in Chip Stone.
At this time, Stone admits he
does not know too much about
expenses, but has a few ideas.

‘“‘We want to play 11. games
next fall,’’ he said. ‘‘Six of these
will be away. The expenses for
five of them will just about
draw out all our expense allot-
ment,’’ which is roughly $2925.

Stone said that he would like

games in 1974, It looks like the
budget would cover such an ex-
pansion. It would, however, be
very close to the end.

“Dr. Scott told me when I
took the job that I should not
think about increasing the
schedule very much," said
Stone. ‘‘What really bothers me
is that if we should get a playoff

bid from the NCAA, we
probably would not have the
money to go.”

If there would ever be

something such as_ this oc-
curing. it would probably be the
straw that would break the
camel's back with regard to
Davidson's athletic crisis.

Soccer would have also an
equipment problem if they
needed any emergency items.

“I do not see any real
problem now.” said Stone. *‘But
if we needed new uniforms or
something, we would be in
trouble. Our budget of $1135 for
equipment just would not cover
anemergency item.”

He cited the costs of soccer
balls, which run about $25 a
piece.

‘They only last for about one
year,”’ Stone commented. ‘“‘If
we get just seven or eight, that
takes quite a hunk from our
allotment.”

Stone sees no dire problem in
the next year with regards to
scholarships or the like. But he
too feel the bite of the rising
costs of living, such as meals
and lodging on the road, as he
plans his expense spendings.

In talking with members of
the baseball team, it seems that
they have to provide their own
bats.

There seems to be a question
now as to whether or not future
players can afford to play sports,
if they can afford the high
costs of a Davidson education.

The baseball expense budget
ranges around $3800, while their
equipment funds are close to
$2000. It seems highly probable
that more money would be in or-
der here.

In addition, some of the
players have been approached
by professional club represen-
tatives. With such quality
players here now, it may be a
ey to offer some type of

grant to keep more of them
coming.
If a program could be funded

well enough to give it an
established reputation, then it
could lure more quality players.

their own bats is not following
this philosophy.

Finally, Hallam Walker,
coach of the sailing team,
presented his views with regard
to his sport.

He bagan by saying that the
$1100 figure his team gets from
the school goes ‘‘essentially for
expenses such as travel,
lodging and the like.”’

He noted that the sailors let
most of the upkeep go through
the athletic business depart-
ment.

‘“‘We have an adequate
amount for expenses,”’ Walker
said. ‘We have received some
outside contributions which
have helped a great deal.”

Walker commented that the
boats and equipment the team
has are in fair shape.

“The team would be delighteu
to find some way to get some
new boats, though.’ he ex-
pressed.

“IT think we have pretty good
support from the college con-
sidering it is a student-run
sport, essentially,’ Walker
prompted. “‘We do not have
too many problems. The boats
show their age (five or six
years). But they get us through
the races. New ones would be
nice, though.”’

So now the problem of a lack
of money has been narrowed
down to two things: equipment
and expenses. Granted, though,
tennis and possibly soccer and
baseball need scholarships.

But as a general rule, all the

sports need more money for
travel and other articies

necessary for high level com-
petition, which is what the
Southern Conference and the
NCAA is all about.

This problem is out in the
open now. The college is going
to have to come to grips with it
and either allieviate the harm
or explain why the priorities are
being placed in the other direc-
tion.

It seems quite possible, from
reviewing the past articles in
this series, thatarearrangement
in the athletic department's
funding could end this problem.

There is going to be an in-
crease in the amounts awarded
to the minor sports next year,
according to C. David Cornell,
vice president for finance and
development. This should
average about $1000 per sport.

The question still remains as
to whether or not this will, in
reality, help the problem in any
significant way at all.

(Next Week: the concluding
article in the series on David-
son's athletic crisis. It will
outline a basic summary of
what this investigation has
revealed and what alternatives
lie ahead as the college tries to
solve its crisis in athletics.)
