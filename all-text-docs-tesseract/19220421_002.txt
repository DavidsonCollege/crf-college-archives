WILLIAM LEE YOUNGER, EX-’19

D-Basketball. D-Baseball.

D-Track.

D-Football.

William Lee Younger, of Lynchburg,
Va., the only athlete to win the D in
four branches of sport at Davidson, was
a member of the class of 1915. Playing
right end on the Wildcat grid team
which held Georgia Tech 21-7, he was
selected on the All-South Atlantic
eleven; in basketball he was rated as
one of the best guards in the State; on
the famous Wildcat nine of '16 he played
Ieft field; and by his high-jumping abil-
ity he made the track team. The last
three years of his college career were
spent at V. P. I., where he continued to
shine. “Monk” is the first and probably
the last Freshman who will win four
monograms, ;

Never has the right wing been guard-
ed more effectively than when Monk
held down the position. On the defense
che was a wonder and rarely did any op-
posing backs get around him. In the
Furman, Carolina, and Wake Forest
games his uncanny ability to nail for-
ward passes led to many a touchdown.

On the hardwood floor Mank was
equally at home and few forwards were
able to get away for open shots. Play-
ing against one of the best forwards in
the State, he held him to a couple of
field goals while caging the ball five
times himself,

In the diamond pastime Monk occu-
pied the left garden and was certain
death to all flies in his territory. Al-
though having a low batting average, he
hit in the’ pinches and was an important
cog in the machine which won 14 cut of
17 contests. ¥

Monk won his fourth letter in the
Clemson meet when he cleared the bar

-at 5 feet 6 inches, winning first place.

After finishing his course at Virginia
Tech, Monk coached at Hampdeu-Sid-
ney, turning out the best teams they had
in several years. He now is back at V.
P. I. coaching the Smithies’ grid tcams.

RED AND BLACK GOLF CLUB
OUTMATCHES GASTONIA MEN.

The Davidson Golf Club played the
Gastonia Club here on Wednesday, April
12, in a closely contested match. This
was the first match of the spring and a
large number of spectators watched the
contest.

ive representatives from the Gastonia
Club were here, and three matches were
layed. In the first match Gray and

Miller, of Gastonia, played Bachman and
Gracy, of Davidson. Although neitner
Pachman nor Gracy played their usual
game, they defeated their opponents 12
up.

In the second match Henry Myers
played Hamner, of Gastonia. This was
a closely contested and very interesting
match. Myers played excellent golf, but
the game ended with Hamner one 1p.

The third match saw Covington and
Rankin, of Gastonia, defeated three up
by Bradley and DeArmond, of Davidscn.
This also was an interesting match and
won the day, for Davidson.

The Davidson Club will uphold their
name Thursday on the Gastonia links.

D.
INTERESTING TOURNAMENT
TO SELECT TENNIS TEAM.

One of the best tennis tournaments
ever held at Davidson is drawing to a
close. After a week of hard fighting 11
of the 16 entrants have been vanquished.
The 16 contestants were divided into two
groups of eight men each. The cham-
pion of the first group plays the cham-
pion of the second group, and the winner
of this match plays the Varsity cham-
pion, at which time he is supposed to
meet his fate.

The men who have thus far retained
the right to slash away at the tennis
balls in this tournament are: Harry
Price, Staley, Henry Myers, Vic Brown,

and H. M. Morris. y
_ In the first group Harry Price defeat-

ed-Beall.on the first go-round by. the’

score of 6-4, 10-8, Harry’s next victim
Was Fraser, who bit the dust to the tune
of 6-3, 6-2, Harry. was: going strong, and
Fraser soon saw that this Freshman was
not so easy to handle as the one he had
defeated earlier in the tournament in
two love sets. Staley is another Fresh-

ed to give a good account of himself be-
fore accepting defeat. His next match
will be with Henry Myers, and_ this
promises to be a battle royal. Henry
is playing at his best this year and is
making a strong bid for a place on the
Varsity.

In the second group Junebug Price,
after
fought contest, had to bow before the
victorious racket of Vic Brown by the
score of 12-10 and 6-4. Without a great
deal of trouble H. M. Morris defeated
Trotter, who ‘made such a good record
in the fall tournament. He then pro-
ceeded to do the same thing for Moss
by the one-sided score of 6-0 and 6-0.
Morris in his next game will crash with
Vic Brown for the ctiampionship of the
second group. The championship of the
first group lies between Price, Staley and
Henry Myers.

While these preliminary matches were
being fought out, the Varsity was not
idle. They, too, must decide their cham-
pion. The first match between Ed Cun- |
ningham and Bradley was a real treat |
to see. It was a great battle and Brad-
ley was considerably relieved after he
had won the deciding set, 10-8. Louis
Wilkenson was the next to go down be-
fore the deadly accuracy of Bradley by
the score of 6-0, 6-1, 6-1. The champion-
ship now rests between Curtis Ormond |
and Bradley.

N. C. State Game.

N. C. State took the second game of
the series from the Wildcats Wednesday
by the score of 5-3. The game, because
of the see-saw nature of the score and
the. heavy hitting, was: full of interest.
The Red and Black team outhit the cap-
itol lads three to two and their defeat
was caused by their failure to hit when
hits meant runs. ai

Davidson scored first in the initial lap
cn Brown’s double to center and Mac
Erwin’s single. State knotted the count
in the second on a two-bagger-and a
brace of neat sacrifices. The next three
innings breezed along in runless style
although each team had several chances
to score. State stepped into the lead
in the sixth on a double, a single, and an
error.

The Wildcats took their turn at lead-
ing the seventh. Luke Erwin pumped
one to center for a pair of twin sacks
and scored when McPherson hopped one
down the first base line. McPherson
took third and Brown scored when Las-
siter errored the latter’s rap. M. Erwin
squeezed the lanky pitcher home with
a perfect bunt. This state of affairs was
anything but pleasing to Hartzell’s crew
so they scored two runs in their half and
grabbed a strangle hold on the lead. An-
other run came across in the eighth.

The Wildcats had: numerous chances
to score but the necessary punch was
lacking. Ten of the Red and Black play-
‘ers were left stranded on’ the sacks, six

‘of them languishing-on: the -hot corner.
