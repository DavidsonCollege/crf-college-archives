On Tuesday, October 16th, Dr. VT. S.

a hospital in Winston-Salem, N.C.) Mr.
Faweette entered Davidson with the
cass of 'o2, but after entrance changed |
his course and took up his study in the,
medical then’ existed in|
connection with the school of Art and,
Science. In his after life he continued |
his medical study in the practice of sur-|
gery and medicine in Burlington, N. C.|
There he had as large a practice as any
doctor of that section, and had therefore
endeared himself to the hearts of many |

school, which

who had come under his care. |

But after twenty-five or more years of |
service, his body began to give way be-

neath the continual strain, and at the}

first hint of sickness, Dr. Fawcett went
to the mountains of Asheville hoping to
regain his lost health, and to again take |
up his work in Burlington. However, |
there seemed to be no signs of improve- |

; ment in his condition, but rather a grad- |
jual change for the worse, so he was,

placed aboard a train to be carried hack. |
When he arrived at Winston-Salem, so!

BARIUM SPRINGS CAUSE PRE-
SENTED TO CONGREGATION

Sunday morning, October 14th, Mr. J. B.
Johnston spoke to the people of David-
son, and the students of Davidson Col-
lege, about the needs and activities of the
Barium Springs Orphanage.

Mr. Johnston is a graduate of David-
‘Ol,
that time he has been engaged in Chris-

son College, of the class of Since
tian work of various kinds, and at pres-
Manager and treasurer of the
Barium Springs Orphanage.

In a few words he set forth the finan
cial condition of the Orphanage. He ex
plained how and where the money that
is given to the orphanage is used. The
demand is so much larger than the sup-
ply. Those who need our help are de-
pending on the annual gifts at Thanks-
giving time to make up the deficit. He

ent is

said that if this was not done he knew
Either

the present number of children will be

of only two courses to pursue.

wnder-clothed and  under-fed, or the

number must be reduced. He pointed
out that it would be an injustice to the
children and to society to force them to
go without food and clothes in a suffi-
cient quantity. “No child can grow to
love his fellow man when he feels that
he has been done an injustice, Con-
sequently, in later years, he will be a
menace, instead of a blessing to society.”

He then told of the school activities
of the children and the home-like at-
mosphere of the institution, and invited
every one to come and see for himself.
He told how the Barium Springs chil-
dren were the first to “go over the top”
in Davidson's Campaign. They believe
that Davidson will do the same for them.
