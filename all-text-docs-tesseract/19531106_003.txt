up against three oppo-| This week the Sigma Chis ended

their tag football season with two
victories to clinch at least a tie
for first honors. The Phi Delts
who have one game remaining have
also lost only one game and could
send the league into a tie with a
final win over the SAEs.

Upsets marked the windup of the
Greek tag football league, as the
unheralded Pi Kapps knocked the
Kappa Sigs out of first place, and
the Phi Gams darkened the hopes
of the KAs by downing the rebels
20 to 6.

In one of the most exciting
games of the year, the Pi Kapps
scored with less than a minute to
go following a Kappa Sig tally

nents and another cage
season will be well
underway. Some indi-
cation of the strength
of the Red and Black
. clad cagers will be
known as they hit some
top-flight opposition
during those first three
games.

The Guilford opener
on the local court on
December 2 begins a
busy week's action while the Cats hit Wake Forest and North
Carolina State on successive nights on that weekend. Of
course, the latter two, conference finalists of last year, will
be “tough cookies” for the Cats, but the experience with the
big teams before they meet any conference opposition may be
“Just what the doctor ordered” for the Millermen.

Traditional Rivals Stay on Schedule

The Cats will have a very much improved schedule this
season, having dropped some of the “giants” who frequented
the local courts last season. Several of the traditional rivalries
will be maintained with the usual home-and-home scheduling.
Among these are the two ACC teams—State and Carolina,
both to be met twice. One of the old rivals, Duke, is now
scheduled for only one game. Many of the national powers
who met the Cats have thus been dropped or reduced to one
encounter so as to have the cagers playing more conference
games.

Of the 22-game card, eight are scheduled with confer-
ence opposition while nine are with ACC teanis, and five are
with non-conference opponents. While the Cats met the other
four teams in the state eight times last year they will go up
against state opposition only six times this year. Fast-break-
ing Tennessee has been dropped entirely from the schedule
and such teams as Guilford, Charleston (2), and Newberry have
been added to the slate.

Eight Teams Go to Conference Tournament

FROSH FOOTBALLERS
IT STRONG CITADEL
IN SEASON'S FINALE

- Last week the Wildcat freshmen
came from behind to turn back
Gordon Military Academy 19-14.
The Cadets scored first, but behind
the brilliant passing of Dyke Little
the Kittens came roaring back. Tom
Newton and Bill Gramley were
outstanding in both defensive play
and grabbing Little's aerials.

This week the team will be some-
what hampered by the eligibility
rule in their effort to gain their
third win. Starters Dallas Brewer,
Adair Hatcher, Tom Newton and
Ken Longro will be badly missed
when the frosh meet The Citadel
yearlings. The Kittens have lost
only to the powerful Furman
eleven and have come a long way
since that game. The offensive has
shown definite improvement, and
the defensive play of Lyle Lewelyn
has been outstanding. Newton and
Bill Gramley, All-American high
school players, have proved them-
selves at the end positions.

The Citadel team will go into
the game a slight favorite, but the
Wildkitten followers can rest as-
sured that the team will be out
there trying to overcome the odds
of having only half their starting
eleven along. This will be the last
scheduled game for the freshmen.

Chesterfield

This week the nearest pre-
dietion of the Davidson-Wash-
ington snd Lee feotball game
score will be good for another
carten of Chesterfield cigar-
ottes. Last week's contest was

being the nearest te the act-

Before NCS Meet 520s Fist Win

Coach Pete Whittle’s Harriers will travel to Raleigh next
Thursday to run in the annual State Cross-Country meet
against Carolina, N.C. State, and Duke. The meet was original-
ly scheduled for this Monday, but was postponed due to a
schedule conflict of Duke and Carolina.

North Carolina State, Atlantic
Coast Conference champs this year,
will be heavily favored to take
the meet with ease. They have
swamped all the participating
teams this year in dual meets; Da-
vidson lost to the ‘Pack in a tri-
angular meet 50-16 (low score
wins).

Sawyer Tops

State is led by “Buz” Sawyer
who is one of the country’s top
runners. Last year he won the
State and the old Southern Con-
ference :meets, besides placing Sth
in the NCCA Intercollegiates.

The Cats will be out to improve
last week's showing in which they
lost to both Washington and Lee
and VMI in a triangular meet held
at Lexington. They have worked
hard this week and have shown
considerable improvement.

Maybe Second?

Last year the locals finished be-
hind the big three in the State
Meet, but this year they have a
good chance of beating Duke, and

could upset Carolina to take
second place behind State.

Williamsburg, Va., for the South-

they will rank as “dark horse”

at Davidson on November 21.

ATTENTION FROSH !

There are still many vacancies
on the freshman wrestling squad,
especially in the light weights. All
interested freshmen are asked to
report to the coach.

Coach Parker points out that
you don't have to be the Charles
Atlas type to be a wrestler. The
light weights are just as important
and previous wrestling experience
is not necessary. You can be a
valuable member of this freshman

Generals Favored
As Cats Still Seek

The best opportunity of the sea-
son to break into the win column
presents itself to Davidson tomor-
row when the Wildcats travel to
Winston-Salem to meet the Gen-
e@vals of Washington and Lee. The
two evenly-matched teams will
meet in Bowman Gray Stadium in
what promises to be a fine ball
game. .

The Davidson team will be in top
shape for tomorrow's contest.
Coach Dole has worked the boys
hard this week, and they should
be ready to really go. Pass de-
fense, which showed up badly at
Harvard last week, has received a
lot of attention. A lot of work has
also been done on fundamental
blocking.

Lowenstein Difference

Last week the Wildcats suc-
cumbed to Harvard’s formidable
Crimsons by a 42-6 county. For the
first half, Davidson held its own,

even though behind. But the Har-

vard reserve strength told the

story in the second half as the| :

score mounted. Substitute quarter-
back Carrol Lowenstein was the
victors’ star, throwing five touch-

passes, a fast running backfield,
and tight' defense to swamp the
SAEs by the score of 34 to 6.
Steve Norton was the offensive
leader tor the SAEs while Ray
Harding and Jimmy Kiser stood
out for the Sigma Chis.

The Kappa Sigs scored in the

WILDCAT OF THE WEEK :

Patton’s Line Play Tops
In D. C.-Harvard Game

By FLOYD FEENEY

Coupling his usual fine offensive game with an outstand-
ing defensive effort in the Harvard game last Saturday, Bob
Patten earned Wildcat of the Week honors.

Calling defensive signals from
his guard position, Bob led the
Davidson defense. His quick play
diagnosis and hard tackling spilled
more than one Crimson back for
a substantial loss.

Reviewing the game Coach Dole
pointed out that Patten made
fewer mistakes in the game than
any other player. He termed Bob

The victory was a costly one for
Harvard. Top-flight quarterback
Bob Hardy received a cracked
right elbow on the second play of
the game, and Dick Clasby, Har-
vard’s All-American back, left the
game in the first quarter as a
result of an injury to his pitching

“one of the real unsung heroes
of the line.”

Bob is comparatively small for
the college guard spot. He weighs
in at about 175 pounds and stands
only five feet eight inches tall.
However, what he lacks in size he
more than makes up for in speed
and hustle. Having chiefly played
offense in last year’s two platoon
system, Bob has done very well in
going both ways this year.

This is his second year of varsity
football. After playing freshman
ball during his first year, he sat
eut his sophomore year without
going out for the team. He re. |
turned last year to nail down the

In addition to football this soft-

sprinter on Cosch Hambright's
swimming team. Bob comes from
Winston-Salem where he also
