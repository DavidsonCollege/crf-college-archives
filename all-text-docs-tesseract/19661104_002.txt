One Step Backwards

Those who were able to ferret from
the cliches and high-flown language
the substance of Dean Frontis John-
ston’s “blue sky” speech Tuesday may
recognize that such thinking could set
the tone for one of the most important
eras in Davidson's history.

His assessments of changes
wrought by the 20th century and their
resulting demands on education were
perceptive indeed. Few would argue
that Davidson can’t continue to “walk
backwards into the future.”

But Dean Johnston’s ideas on to-
day’s students and their role in policy
making are less than complimentary
—they are an insult. Today’s college
students are more serious ‘and con-
cerned, the dean said, but they are not
as educable or docile. They lack ma-
turity. . ;

Does the dean equate docility with
mautrity? The time is admittedly gone
when students obediently and unques-
tioningly go along with administration

policies, but most would construe this .

as a more mature approach, rather
than less.

We want the aid of the student body
in curriculum reform, Dr. Johnston
said, but he didn’t say that the Blue
Sky Committee had voted unanimous-

ly not to allow a student member on.

their committee. Instead, he asked for
the Student Council to create a paral-
lel committee which would consider
students’ ideas on curriculum reform

and meet occasionally with the fac- .

ulty’s committee to pass along student
ideas.

While students at other progressive
schools are getting more and more
voice in policy making, Davidson stu-
dents are being asked to formalize a
structure which would accentuate the
dichotomy between student and pro-
fessor rather than minimize it. The
Self Study acknowledges that “stu-
dent participation in policy making at
Davidson is_ essentially indirect,”
through such means as individual con-
tact with professors rather than
through any formal structure.

Such a student committee has the
potential to render a valuable service
to the discussion on curriculum revi-
sion, but it is no substitute for having
student representation on the Blue
Sky Committee.

The reason advanced for refusing
to allow a student voice on the com-
mittee is the issue of faculty personal-
ities which will inevitably come up in
deliberations on specific changes. The
professors feel they cannot openly dis-
cuss other professors in the presence
of a student.

Such an explanation is a weak ex-
cuse for refusing students the right
to have a direct say in matters affect-
ing the college. In the first place, no
faculty member is naive enough to
think that students don’t discuss pro-
fessors’ personalities or that students
don’t know how professors are regard-
ed by their colleagues. ;

An admission that the committee
members can’t openly discuss issues
in the presence of a student is an indi-

cation of faculty opinion of students’
role in policy making. The committee
should have confidence in the Student
Council to appoint a level-headed stu-
dent representative who would refrain
from broadcasting committee deliber-
ations to the rest of the student body.

In an adaptation of one of the dean’s
own extended meataphors, labor (stu-
dents) and management (faculty) are
at odds, and each needs an organized
voice to communicate with the other.
Labor never got anywhere as long as
it exerted an indirect influence on de-
liberations; likewise, students need an
equal voice to make known their
thinking through official channels.

Several weeks ago Dr. Anthony Ab-
bott called for students to show a riew
courage in their approach to educa-
tion, to think daringly. “Education is
a two-way process,” he said. Faculty
and student should learn from each
other. Now is the time for the faculty
to show its courage and learn from
students.

Time For Clarification

Action by the Student Council in
making selection of the Miscellany ed-
itor the function of an independently
operated, self-sustaining board raises
the heretofore dormant question of
who shall be ultimately responsible
for selecting editors of the school’s
student publications. '

In the past, the Publications Board
has exercised the function of nomi-
nating candidates who would be elect-
ed by students, despite the fact that
there has existed, in the Student
Council Bylaws, a non-operating Mag-
azine Advisory Board empowered to
nominate candidates for the maga-
zine’s editorship.

And the Publications Board has no
specifically enumerated powers, in its
constituton, to control who shall be
named as possible editors. Indeed, the
board’s function has varied, but its
role has always been primarily one of
controlling financial aspects and only
secondarily editorial management.

In assuming responsibility for es-
tablishing the procedure for selection
of the Miscellany editor, the council
has, in effect, asserted a control over
all student publications. The implica-
tion is that the council could eventu-
ally determne who would receive an
editorship, by setting out the means
of selecting the editor.

Such a power could eventually
bring THE DAVIDSONIAN, hereto-
fore a newspaper independent of con-
trol by any political type body, under
the. wings of the Student Council,
making it almost completely ineffec-
tive as an independent organ.

Responsibility and accountability
fall much more naturally to the Publi-
cations Board than to the council, for
not only is the board composed of stu-
dent journalists familiar with the de-
mands of campus publications, but it
would have far less involvement in the
political views of an editor.

The Smooth Society

Congratulations to the young
Messrs. Larry Brand and Michael
Bandler, of Forest Hills, who have es-
tablished their right, after two weeks
of penance on the detention bench, to
wear their hair long in high school.

The blow they thereby struck for
freedom—the freedom to be hirsute
—will doubtless go rolling tidally
through the halls of secondary educa-
tion coast to coast, and we have been
set to wondering what there is about
long male hair that is so menacing.

Is it its tendency to pick up lint.
soot and bacilli. No, for the hair of
long-haired boys we see looks, if any-
thing, offensively washed, and, any-
way, the locks of ladies, however long,
appear as far beyond sanitary consid-
erations as the wavelets of the high,
gnviolable seas.

Is it, then, the femaleness of long
hair on males that offends us, turns
us queasy? Yet what is so intrinsical-
ly masculine about a close-cropped
head? Do we think Charlemagne fey?
Prince Valiant? Albert Einstein? John
the Baptist?

Ah, John the Baptist. Perhaps what
we mind is being surrounded by cig-
arette-smoking young persons uncom-
fortably reminiscent of Sunday-School
oleographs. We have come a long way,
nigh unto two thousand years, to get
away from those people, and it is a
shock to realize that the neighbor’s
son who used to mow our lawn has
returned from Berkeley looking pre-
cisely like Jesus—that Jesus, in a
sense, was in him all along, waiting
to be let out. .

It may be that smooth chins, cheeks
and skulls represent to us something

reciously modern—smoothness as an
deal, man as interchangeable, fric-
tionless—and that all this bristling and

flowing going on around us threatens
to gum up the machine, Well, is the
machine really that fragile? And was
it designed to be eternal? We were
furry primates before we were ro-

bots.

Be Prepared

There’s an old custom that when
one makes an appointment, he makes
it a point to keep it. “Drop backstage
for an interview,” said the telegram
last week, inviting THE DAVIDSON-
IAN to chat with the Righteous Broth-
ers troupe after their performance
here Friday night.

But lo and behold, when the news-
paper’s reporter and photographer
started looking for the boys after their
extravaganza, they were gone.

“We just didn’t feel comfortable
around here,” they were heard to re-
mark. And so they cleared out, pron-
to, immediately after the show. No ex-
planations, no apologies, no nothing.

The cause of their discomfort was
apparently a rousing round of hisses
that met the two comedians that ac-
companied the entourage.

Hissing is part of the game of en-
tertainment, particularly at Davidson,
and bush-league comedians should
learn to live with it.

But it’s doubly insulting when
$7,000 is going into a two-hour con-
cert that included obviously second-
rate entertainment. At that rate, we’re
entitled to our own kind of fun.

Here’s hoping the next entertain-
ers will be forewarned of the David-
son Audience, in order to avoid a re-
play of such childish behavior on the
part of “professional entertainment.”

LBJ, VIETNAM, KING HURT SENATOR

Percy Leads

Two years ago, neither Bat-
man, Robin, the Green Hor-
net, nor any other nationally
recognized figure could have
unseated veteran Hllinois Sen.
ator Paul H. Dauglas, a lib.
eral, civil - rights - backing,
Johnson-supporting Democrat.

But now Douglas is being
challenged. by a liberal, civil-
rights - backing, Republican
youngster, Charles H. Percy,
and Douglas is experiencing
serious doubts about his re-
election.

Trends on the national level
have seriously injured Doug-
las’ chances. Midwesterners
are becoming more uncertain
of the Democratic administra-
tion now in office, and LBJ's
popularity has dipped badly,
as it has in other parts of
the United States. This devel.
opment will almost certainly
hurt Douglas as well as any

other Democrat in the off-
year election.

Both the escalation of the
Vietnam war and the increase
of non-non-violent civil rights
demonstrations have disillu.
sioned many Illinois voters.
In addition, several local inci-
dents have added to the loss

Normal Moral Questions

Situation Ethics: The New
Morality, by Joseph Fletcher.

A Review
By SAMUEL MALONEY
Associate Professor of Bible

Not since Bishop Robinson's
exciting promise of freedom
from traditional legal‘sm in

Honest to God has a cloarer..

more thoroughgoing presen'a
tion of the new moral tv
emerged than in Situation Eth-
les.

Many writers, some unknow.
ingly. have foreshadowed the
new morality—Luther, Brun-
ner, Bonhoeffer and H. R.
Niebuhr. Robinson asserts. “I
believe it (the new morality)
is the only ethic for ‘man
come of age.’ To resist it in
the name of religious sanc-
tions will not stop it: it will
only ensure that. the form it
takes will be anti-Christian.”

Situation ethics approaches
moral dilemmas by neither
law nor lawlessness; it is a
way of love. According to
Fletcher, ‘The situationist en-
ters into every decision-mak-
ing situation fully armed with
the ethical maxims of his
community and its heritage,
and: he treats them with re-
spect as illuminators of his
problems.

“Just the same he is pre-
pared in any situation to com-
promise them or set them
aside In the situation if love
seems better served by doing
so’. The magic formula is sit-
uation plus love equals right
action.

Criticizing a popularly writ-
ten book which presents a
simple, appealing solution to
muddled ethical problems is
emotionally difficult. If only
situation ethics could answer

man’s moral problems. Unfor-

tunately. much of this bold,
breezy book leaves the reader
dissatisfied.

In the first place, the terms
are not defined. An extremely
careful designation of what
constitutes a situation is essen-
tial if the situation is the de-
terminative factor.

The case.type illustrations
Fletcher uses are dramatic
rather than daily. They are
seldom-faced decisions like
abortion, filicide, sex in the
service of one’s country, sac-
rificial adultery, auto-euthan.

asia. decision to drop an atom
bomb.

Should these exceptional sit-
uations be the starting point
for ethical inquiry? Are two
alcohol stimulated young peo-
ple jin a situation where tra-
ditional 2th cal standards and
family morzs can be r2ason
ably abandoned?

Fletcher's situations are in.
dividualistic and interperson-
al. Ho dsregards the s:gnifi-
cant social morality embodied
in such problems as the Viet
Nam War, racial tensions, and
minimum wage laws.

Nor is what Fletcher means
by love sufficiently clear. He
obviously has in mind New
Testament agape, but his ex-
travagant meanings encom.
pass too wide a field to pro-
vide practical help in practical
situations. He even hedges on
his formula by defining agape
as ‘‘goodwill at. work in part-
nership with reason”.

While the introduction of rea-
son into the formula, removes
the shock effect of his presen.
tation of love as the sole norm,
many situations are simply
not conducive to “‘love-using-
its-head’’ decisions.

There are, furthermore, far
from sufficient guidelines for
a man’s knowing when his ac-
tions are right. When Fletcher

Dear Ed‘‘or:

Significantly, our Dean of
the Faculty has earnestly
opened the door for cons‘dera-
tions of drastic curriculum
changes, and consequently,
other structural changes which
are necessarily associated with
Davidson's quest to be a first-
rate modern college.»

We must let no obstacle of
traditional approaches and
structures blur our thinking
as we onconly and realistically
consider, at long last. what
must be done to make our
higher educational system here
one of the best in the country.

Certainly a few of the pro-
grams and changes to be con-
sidered, debated, and realis-
tically planned and executed
are increased independent’
study projects in all fields,

“holds that whatever is the
most loving thing in the situa-
tion is the right and good
thing,’ he presumes man both
knows what is the most loving
thing and can do it. Here
Fletcher's anthropological as-
sump:‘ons are questionable.

When a person does the most
loving thing in imitation of
God, Fletcher continues, ‘‘It
is not excusably evil, it is pos.
itively good.” From my own
partic:pation in mass bomb-
ings, I shrink from labeling
the killing of civilian popula-
tion as an unambiguous moral
value.

Luther permitted a man to
“sin bravely.’ Luther did not,
however, confuse the right
thing with the lesser evil as
Fletcher does when he uses
Luther's words inconsistently.

Situation Ethies is vulner-
able in still other areas. This
is clearly a theological, utili.
trian, pragmatic ethic which
mounts an insufficient case
against deontological ethics or
ontological love.

Using terms and distinctions
made by William Frankena, is
not ‘‘rule-agapism” more rele-
vant than ‘‘act-agapism” for
the everyday situations of li‘e?
If situation ethics, has virtue
it-is as a conclusion to a life
of ethical wrestling and reflec.
tion—not as a premise.

weight behind these demands,
and his presence alone seems
to have instigated Negro re
sentment.

Because Daley hasn’t made
any significant moves to ap:
pease the Negro leaders, Ne-
gro disgust has been growing.
and there is a possibility that
the predominantly Democratic
Negro bloc will splinter and
hand Percy the election.

While Illinois Negro dis-

side-stepping has been increas-
ing, Ilinois whites are be-
coming more displeased with
the increased racial violence

backlash vote from these
whites can only help Percy.

Offsetting ‘this to some ex-
tent, perhaps, is every voter’s
contentment with the coun-
try's increased prosperity and
new lows in unemployment
statistics. Though the econom-
ic gains cannot hope to bal-
ance the growing social re-
sentment in Illinois, it does
force the voter to consider the
two candidates’ platforms as
well as their individual per-
sonalities, a major factor in
any. campaign.

There is little difference be-
tween the two candidates in
their stands on the major is-
sues facing Americans today.

Senate Race

Both support open occupancy
legislation; both favor a ne.’
gotiated peace in Viet Nam
and continuation of a Strong
American military force jn
the nation.

Their stands on economic js.
sues are typically slanted and
equally indistinguishing. pur.
ing this time (inflation-pros..
perity), Illinois needs (the. vj.
gor of youth—the steady hang
of experience) representing
the citizen in Congress.

There is a unique develop
ment to consider before pre.
dicting the outcome of the
election. Due to the macabre
murder of Percy's daughter,
Valerie. the pollsters have pre.
dicted a sizeable “sympathy
vote’ for the Republican.

In addition to providing an.
other factor in the election,
the tragedy has caused the
candidates to assume a more
somber campaign. and there
has been a notable lack of.
political verbiage that usually
accompanies the off-year con-
tests.

Percy wa’ defeated in his
only other bid for office. that
of governor of Illinois, and re-
marked at that time that his
defeat came as a result of
lack of downstate support.
But now Percy supporters are
predicting a 500,000 vote plu.
rality for him on Nov. 8, and
it doesn’t look as if Mr. Percy
will need to look for excuses
this time.

A Quick Look

THINGS LOOK ROUGH for the Democrats this
off-year election despite a number of strong candi-
dates The Republicans have only one problem: how
to generate enough votes to capitalize upon the
“strengths” of some of the Democratic aspirants.

We certainly aren't lacking for new faces this
year, and political analysts are being given a free
reign. The South is able to point to itself with dis-
nity once again, the home of the sedate and level-
headed. The nominations no doubt reflect the seri-
ous thought with which people are approaching this
election. A quick look at a few of the Governors’
races indicates a number of heartening things.

__ In Georgia the appealing-looking Bo Callaway has
it ade, or he did until the Democrats nominated a
more novel face, that of Lester Maddox. Maddox has
that wonderful gift of instant public image, and the
Atlanta newspapers have gone out of their way to

give “GoBo” a hard time.

DISREGARDING OUTRIGHT AFFRONTS to the
law, who wouldn’t vote for Maddox and put him in
the new Governors’ Mansion? The gates to the
grounds have been appropriately painted: “this is
Maddox country.” His record is consistent; he rejects
the law (the civil rights legislation), and he has never
held offce. If Maddox is elected Georgia will never
again have to secede from the Union; she may be
thorwn out. Give us a break, Georgia voters, re-
store some of our confidence in you.

Alabama, fed up with the antics of Governor
George Wallace to avert integration, has taken a new
tack which should prove to be unique to say the
least. They have decided to throw out the office of
Governor and replace it with that of Governess. The
most likely female winner is ironically (?) Lurlene
Wallace, the Governor’s wife.

ONE THING about Alabama Democrats, they have
gotten George Wallace out of state politics. (Did any-
one ever hear of a wife listening to her husband once
he handed over the reins?) Now they plan to run
Wallace for the presidency in 1968; Democrats, pre- .
pare yourselves for the Great Society. Part II or the
first chapter of “How to Make Your Wife President.”

In Arkansas Faub.:s has at last decided he is too
old. and the Democrats have thrown ove: his ma-
chine, thank goodness, to nominate .Jim'ny Johnson,
a well-known, mild-mannered, country fellow who
impresses one immediately with his articulate com-
mand of a strange Ozark dialect; enter a segrogation-
ist Great Society proponent. Winthrop Rockefeller
will probably have considerably more trouble here
than brother ‘Nelson will have in New Yor!: where
party may prevail even though the choice for the
voter is not at all cicarly drawn.

California promises to be interesting, and the
press has made the candidates at least as colorful as
the southern contenders; when you are dealing with
a man like Pat Brown this is very difficult. ?erhaps
Brown has more than people from the East are able
to see; Bobby Kennedy went all the way to the west
coast to convince the women of California what they
surely must have known; Brown just cannot compare
in looks and per onality with Reagan. At ‘ast the
Sinatras didn’t split over supnort for the Governor;
their good sense is an example to be considered

closaly by 2).

THUS WE SEE in this

tics stand on the own feat th ev hove not been over-
