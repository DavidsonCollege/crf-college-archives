Movies and Billiards
Highlight Union Week

The movie, “Hollywood Story,”
which was shown Thursday night,
will be shown again in the College
Union Saturday at 9 pm. The}
movie stars Julia Adams and)
Richard Conte. Henry Hall, Fred
Clark, Jim Backus, and Richard
Egan are also in the cast.

On Friday, Oct. 7, and Saturday, |
Oct. 8, the film, “Peggy,” will be
presented. |

Charles C. Peterson, Billiard
wizard, ends a two-day exhibition
at the Union with a performance
at 8:15 p.m. today. Peterson, world
champion trick shot artist, has been
here since Thursday afternoon—
giving exhibitions, and free ad-
vice to loeal would-be billiard

danee will last from 9 p. m. to 1!

There being no classes Saturday
morning, many will find it advan- |
tageous to spend this extra time
sleeping, while others will be able
to find enough strength to meet
their dates and escort them around
the campus steeped with tradition
which must be explained to the
young ladies, whether this be her
first or tenth visit to the campus.

The Davidsonian himself always
seems to discover some new area,
tradition, or aspect of the campus
during these visits—sometimes the
chandelier of Phi Hall, sometimes
the foot switch of the old well,
sometimes a new bench on the
lawn, but always something.

For the most part Saturday
morning will be devoted to the re-
turning alumni. The dedication of

at 10:30 a. m. on the plaza in front
of the dormitory. Members of the
trustees and administration will

All but one of the Council mem- ;
bers were present at this first meet-
ing. Even though the meeting was |
an “open” one, as all Council meet- |
ings will be, there was no audience
at the meeting

Councilman John McLaughlin,
Davidson’s representative to last
summer's National Student Assem-
bly in Minneapolis gave the Coun-|
cil his report on the Assembly

McLaughlin said that the general |
theme of the Assambly was a. phil- |
osophical discussion on the aims
and goals of higher education
Among the more concrete points
McLaughlin listed the following as
points urged by the Assembly:

(1) Student government should not
be just a coordinator of stu
dent activities;

(2) Student government should ex-

pand to represent all phases of

student life;

Student government should}

judge and take a more active |

stand on what it thinks about |
the college curriculum and
academic courses;

(4) College committees should in

clude underclassmen, for the

purpose of giving them future
experience:

Student government should

j stress and work for the attain

ment of a higher intellect

ty relations, the student body

should be kept informed of stu-
dent representation on the va-

tees. The students should know
what action was taken, and the
reasons. It was felt that this
policy would enable the indi
vidual student to voice his own
opinion to the committee rep-
resentatives, and therefore, he
would have the feeling that
his interest was voiced to the
faculty

through their student Coun
cil, should have a stronger

trative policy

In summing up, McLaughlin said
that he thinks that the NSA will
grow into a powerful student voice
throughout the world, and for this
reason, Davidson College should
continue to represent itself at the

| assemblies. McLaughlin felt that

much of the opinions expressed
during the convention were of a
radical nature, and that the South-
ern colleges, such as Davidson,
could be a most stabilizing conser-

 vative influence

After presenting his report of

the NSA activities, Councilman Mc- |

Laughlin said that he felt that stu-
dents should try to feel more con-
fidence toward their Student Coun-
cil representatives. To harbor this
feeling, he presented a three point
