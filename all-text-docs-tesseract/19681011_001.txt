Board Alters Church Rule;
College Exceeds Challenge

The trustees heard today
that the college's Ford Chal-
lenge Campaign exceeded its
$5.5 million goal by more
than $1 million and voted to
lessen the so-called Presby-
terian restriction on the Da-
vidson presidency.

collected its final pledges
over the summer, shows

gan July 1, 1965. qualifying
the college for $2.2 million in
matching funds from the
Ford Foundation.

President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr., who announced the
totals, praised President D.
Grier Martin and Robert J.
Sailstad, former director of
public relations and develop-
ment, as well as some 1,000
alumni friends. for their roles
in the campaign.

The trustees’ vote, which
will permit non-Presbyter-
tans to be elected to the col-
lege presidency, deleted from
the qualifications of persons
elligible to be president of
the college this sentence:

“No person shall be eligi-
ble for election as President
of the College unless he is a
member of the Presbyterian
Church and he shall not be
eligible for inauguration un-
less he is a member of the
Presbyterian Church in the
United States.”

In its place, following @
statement about the need
for “Christian faith and
commitment,’ the trustees
inserted: ‘Such faith and
commitment will be appro-
priately expressed by his af-
filiation with the Presbyter-
jan Church in the United
States and his active partici-
pation in the life of the col-
lege,’ so that a non-Presby-
terian could be elected if he

agreed to later become a
Presbyterian.

son's educational program.

Five Commissions

Managing Editor

**I come to Davidson not as
its chief defender but as its
chief critic,” newly-installed
President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. told trustees, faculty
and students this morning as
he announced the establish-
ment of five commissions ‘to
investigate ‘“‘certain unans-
wered questions.”

The idea of the five com-
missions, each including
three trustees, three stud-
ents. three faculty members
and a staff member, were
greeted with applause by the
almost capacity audience.

Along with the advisory
commissions would work ‘‘an
outside, authoritative agen-
cy,’ which “will be asked
to help develop an overall de-
sign’’ for the college.

The five commissions are:

Student Demonstrators

Aim Protest At ROTC

By ROB KREHBIEL
Staff Writer

A group of demonstrators
demanding voluntary ROTC
picketed near the drill field
Tuesday afternoon.

“This demonstration was
the first part of a many-
stepped program" to bring
voluntary ROTC to Davidson,
said senior Sam Johnson, one
of the organizers.

Although freshmen this
year can get parental per-

mission to avoid participa-
tion in ROTC, the protesters
said they felt the program is

student himself.

Signs reading “End Com-
pulsory ROTC’ and “David-
son Is No Place For Tyran-
ny” appeared.

According to senior Bob
Grady. a participant in the
protest, “We felt that the
demonstration was _ success-
ful, judging from the reac-

‘tion of many students.”

The first group of fresh-
men who passed the demon-
strators clapped. ‘

Grady, who stressed the
picketing was ‘non-disrup-
tive,’ said the group of dem-
onstrators doubled from 12
to about 25 as the students
left drill.

“ ... One of the ways in which we can dem-
onstrate that we mean what we say about non-
discrimination is to open the doors of opportunity

ternities in such a program

In other business today, the

dowment investment policies.
reopened discussion on the
site of the new library and
took steps to establish the
five study commissions rec-
ommended today by Presi-
dent Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

Current trustee bylaws pro-
vide that no endowment capi-
tal be used for investment
purposes, Lingle said. There
fore the college has been re-
stricted in the common stock
field to buying only those
stocks with a high dividend
rate in order to secure oper-
ating capital.

These do not normally ap
preciate considerably, he ex-
plained. Under the proposed
amendment the trustees’ Fi
nance Committee could rec-
uvmimend specific use of. in-

vestment capital for operat- .

ing purposes.

Therefore the college would
not need to buy high-dividend
stocks in order to have oper-
ating capital. he said.

An earlier trustee decision
to put the Edward H. Little
Library on the Lingle Manor
site was rescinded.

Spencer announced that al-
though the college was within
$110,000 of meeting the $1.5
millién challenge figure
necessary to get $500.000 @&om
Little, “It is now anticipated
that it will cost more than
$2 million, due to inflation
and an increase in the builc-
ing’s size.”

He also said the excess
funds ralsed in the recent
Ford Challenge campaign
would now be applied toward
the library challenge.

tatives for the five commis-
sions announced today will
be left to Spencer, Lingle
said.

In adopting the code. the
trustees also voted to require
all freshmen to take a course -
dealing with alcohol, drugs
and mental health. The
course was recommended by
Spencer and wilt be adminis-
tered by the Office of the
Dean of Students, Lingle said.

The trustees also provided

their May, 1969, and May.

Burts Lists
New Rules
On Drink

Students may now drink on
campus, since the Code of
Responsibility is now in ef-
fect. according to Dean of
Students Richard C. Burts Jr.

However, he warned that
all provisions of state law
would apply to the drinking,
including;

—No possession or con-

Drinking in dormitories and
at fraternity houses is per-
mitted, but students may not
drink at dances or bonfires
on campus tonight.

At the Union, all drinking
is limited to the snack bar
area, and alcoholic bever-
ages elsewhere in the Union
must be concealed.

Girls wouid not be allowed
in the dorms until the Resi-

dence Hall Association is

Peter Hobbie warned that so
far only Cannon Dorm had
any students who had filed for
the Residence Hall Council,
and that no dorm could enter-
tain women until! it had elect-
ed such, representatives.

“This town used to be called Davidson
College, back during the 1800's,’’ the
Negro man said and smiled. “The col-
lege was the only place people could
work and it ran the town.

“Then new manufacturing came in
here. Now people. Negro people in Da-
vidson, can get other jobs in town, may-
be make $80-90 a week.

*"The college doesn’t have that power
any more. Now we don’? want your old
clothes, the charity you give us. Used
to be the professors would give their
old suits and things to the janitors.

But we don’t want this. We want
money, we want the pay we get, we
want an honest wage.”

The speaker has lived in Davidson and
worked for the college for a long time.
He is a Negro, a resident of The Other
Davidson. He was thoughtful as he spoke
of things that have changed in David-
son. .
“When 1 first came to work here,
the coflege’s policy was, pay the Negro
only enough so that he'll come back
Monday on his knees beggin’.

“When David Grier Mertin came

here he raised pay a little, seid men
would do a better job if you paid them
more.

‘When I first came here, we had to
call all the students sir. I would catch
the very devil from my boss if a stu-
dent told him I didn’t call him sir. I
couldn't go in the Union. I couldn’t go
into the chapel.

‘Now that’s all changed.”

There was animation and a strange
sort of resignation in his voice as he
told how several years ago he had been
working with a young man who had five

children and was earning $38 a week-as .

a janitor at the college.

The man got a second job at a nearby
hospital. He needed both full-time jobs
to support his family.

“The collége found out about it and
they called down to the hospital and
told them to fire him. They did.

“The college didn’t want the Negro
man to have two jobs. That meant he
was less under their control.”

He was quiet but a little more excited
as he continued. He smiled his same
resigned smile and went on.

“One time after | had been working
here a few years | applied for a job
with a bank in Charlotte. They said

could they cali my boss out here, {
sald sure. The called... .. and he tatk-
ed to the man at the bank and told
him, look here, you’re an alumnus of
Davidson, don’t hire our people away
from us.

“And | didn’t get the job.

“Before General Time and these other
places came in here and there was just
one or two other places a man could
work here, the college would get together
with them and decide on what they were
going to pay the Negroes.

“If a man quit his job here, or if he
tried to get a job someplace else, the
college would call and tell the other place
not to hire him, and they wouldn’t.

“If you got in bad with the college,
you couldn't get a job here anywhere.”

Now college emplyoes get a minimum
wage of $1.60. or above, an hour or
$3328 a year. But as recently as 1964
employes received only 98 cents an hour,
with no overtime benefits.

“All that time, they were Christians
and were going to church. And I can see
the steeple on that church from my
house.” .

And he gestured toward the College
Church and beyond it, toward The Other
Davidson.
