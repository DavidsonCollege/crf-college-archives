This was the first college
competition for the “B” team
composed of Harold Fisher and

Govan and Bill Brown, nega-

Dr. J. T. Drake, coach of the
debate team, said that David-

to the tournament, because of
the experience that the debat-

There will be few debate
activities until the beginning
of next semester when prac-
tice will begin again. Dr.
Drake hopes to form a third
team at that time if more
men come out.

On Feb. 17, the debate team
will travel to Florida State Uni-

teams from. the entire South,
and they will attend a tourna-
