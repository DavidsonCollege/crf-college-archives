... hall counselors -

[Continued from page 4]

Myth number four: The Hall
Counselor program is one of the most
important concerns of the Dean of
Students office. The fact is that
nothing is of that much concern to
anyone on first floor Chambers (with
some notable exceptions Dr. Wil-
liams.) When Dr. Spencer became
bored and cut out Hall Counselor pay,
Dean Terry was virtually silent.

Now let us turn our attention to the
freshman year experience. For many,
‘freshman year is one of the best years
at Davidson. However, while initial
effects of the freshmen hall are
satisfying, this is short-lived. The
freshman hall encourages a norrow
field of interaction with students*not
on your hall..

Your best friends tend to come from
a freshman hall. Freshman halls
typically sign up for an eating house
or fraternity en masse. Groups of
people on halls try to block house
during their sophomore year.

So profound is the effect of the hall,
that in all subsequent years at
Davidson you begin to realize that
you have acquired the habit of
socializing with only those who live on
your dorm halls, or in the same house
with you. Is this justified at a school
of this size?

What then is the solution? I believe
the Wilensky Doctrine (Mr. Wilensky
of course did not originate this
concept, but since I do not knowgwho
did I will credit him) is the most
plausible.

This line of reasoning abolishes all
freshman halls. Allows all the halls to
be mixed. The result would be more
interaction among all classes. A
freshman on a hall with seven
upper-classmen would in effect have
seven hall consultants. The living
situation would be more natural and
interesting.

Many people will intially reject this
proposal, but then people always
resist change, especially at Davidson.

John Bird
has seen Davidson

from both sides

“Daddy Bird” speaks

By GEORGE KING
Staff Writer

When night weighs heavy and the
pain of academics brings sweat to
brow most students turn to thier
Union. In Davidson that means the
900 Room. There you can find a
relazing atmosphere, good spirits,
and that peach loving purveyor of
intoxicants John Bird.

John is a 23 year old alumnus from
Norfolk, Virginia with a Major in
history. He has worked for ARA
Slater for five years.

One of the first things one notices’
about John is his incredible interest in
people. “‘The most valuable part of
my Davidson experience has been the
people I got to know,” he said. This
attitude has certainly proved valuable
in his job this year.

But how does Davidson look to
such an observer, a man who has seen
it both as a student and a ‘‘towny.”
First of all there is a distinction
between Davidson and Davidson
College. This distinction is too often
overlooked by most students of the
college. Of the town John says, “It’s
a good place with lots of people. I love
it...It’s sécure.’’ But ‘‘it’s too easy to

slide by. There is no pressure in any
direction to make you excell. It’s a
self-stifling atmospere. It doesn’t
move with time’”’

The college on the other hand has
changed. Today’s student seems a lot
more involved in academics, a lot
more’ concerned with his future
(though probably no more of them
know where they are going). This is
due in part to co-education.

‘Having girls on campus has
calmed a lot of guys down.’’ It has
also made the school more competi-
tive. ‘The college seems to be taking
less people who are not goal-ori-
ented. People used to party~more, to
pass more time... You used to be able
to go out at night and find people
looking for anyone to talk to.”’

It is the ability to ‘‘Pass time” that
seems to distinguish the life of John
the student from John the ‘‘towny”’.
John feels that as a student one has
an excuse for being here, a direction.
Without that excuse life in Davidson
becomes too secure.

“There is this incredible sense of
waste. I’m spinning my wheels. I’m
not going anywhere. I’m not ad-
vancing inside or out. I’m passing
time.’’

Duffer reflects as 8-year veteran

By ANN WICKER
Staff Writer

In the fall of 1968, the class

of ’72 arrived at Davidson.
' Among those lads was a fellow
by the name of Duff Bruce.
Duff Bruce, who may or may
not be a legend in his own
time, has been here ever since.
The obvious question then

is what makes a student stay
around here after he gradu-
ates. Duff still is not sure. “I
had decided not to go to law
school and being assistant to
‘the President seemed like an
interesting way to pass a year

while I thought about what to .

-do.”’

He was ready to leave again
after that year when C.Shaw
Smith was looking for an
assistant director for the Un-
ion. Duff was logical candidate
because as as student he
worked closely with the Union
and served as Vice President
and Social Council Chairman.
Since he had worked on the
inside he knew what to expect
of such a job.

Again, after a year was up,
he was ready to leave. Then a
position in the Admissions
Office became available. Says
Duff, ‘‘I’m sort of the Eliot
Richardson of Davidson Col-
lege.’’ He never dreamed he

would stay here this long. His
“crowning achievement,’’he
says was recieving Omicron
Delta Kappa at Spring Convo-
cation this year. ‘‘Id stick
around some more if I thought
I’d get Phi Beta Kappa.”’

Duff has a whole library full
of stories of his years at
Davidson. Besides his many
Union activities, he was a hall
counselor. Duff has been here
to see some major changes in
the college. He believes co-ed-
ucation was and is good for the
school.

He says, however, the cam-
pus seems quieter. ‘‘There are
not as many really crazy
people like Miles Ward, and

there are no happenings like

the What-a-Betty fiasco.”

He also believes the changes
in the social system of Patter-
son Court were good for
students though many alumni
were and are disillusioned. He
feels too that the students
need to plan more to keep that
situation workable.’”’ Patter-
son Court could easily work its
way into a very curious double
standard.”

Duff talked of his student
years as I hope I can remem-
ber mine. Duff’s freshman
class was the last to have to
wear beanies. ‘‘It was a sort of
campus wide haze. It pro-
moted unity in the freshman

class at least.’’

At that time all freshmen
were in Watts, Cannon, and
Sentelle. All sophomores were
in Belk. Every year, at least
once, the freshman class had
to attack Belk in a huge
waterfight. “If you didn’t, you
were a wimp.” Naturally, Duff
and his classmates were not
wimps. Anyway, one of Duff’s
friends broke a waterfighting
‘“‘law’’ and dumped some water
into a room. Duff just hap-
pened to be with him. The two
basketball players who lived in
the room were not pleased.

Someone had recognized
Duff, and the next thing he
knew he was being stuffed into
a large metal trash can and
rolled down two flights of
stairs. Then these two drunk
basketball players picked him
up, dragged him to the top to
the stairs and held him by his
ankles, threatening to drop
him. ‘‘I thought my life was
forfeited.”

They relented, but not be-
fore Duff lost all the change in
his pockets as it trickled past
his earlobe and tinkled faintly
on the stair well below.

Later, as a hall counselor,
Duff, again saw his life flash
before him when two guys on
his hall pulled a prank in the
old Union. They put a liquid
center golf ball into a micro-

wave oven. The ball exploded
through the grill on the door,
shot across the room, and
embedded itself two inches
into the plaster next to Duff’s
ear. .
Our man Duff was also
around during the days of
nationwide campus unrest and
the ‘‘big march on Washing-
ton.’’ All the large universities
had to close down during those

‘days. Davidson was ‘‘seething

with rest.’’ A sit-in on the
lawn across from the Post
Office was sparsely attended.

Duff and a few die-hards did
make the pilgrimage to
Washington--‘‘more’ out of
curiosity than anything else.”
While he was in a phone booth
calling home, he got tear
gassed. ‘‘It was so ironic. I felt
like I was in one of Kurt
Vonnegut’s novels.’

A highlight of Duff’s career
as a student working with the
Union was Spring Frolics his
senior year. Nitty Gritty Dirt
Band made their second
appearance, and Bette Midler,
with Barry Manilow on piano,
appeared in Chambers Ban-
quet Hall.

Duff is certainly not leaving
Davidson ‘because he is disil-
lusioned with the place or the
people. He knows, perhaps
better than many of us, about
the good and the bad aspects

of life at Davidson. His main
observation is that the close-
ness of Davidson sometimes
really works against it. He
remarked that the morale of
the faculty seems low at this
time. The reasons for this are
hard to pinpoint, but perhaps
once some decisions are made
about the academic vice presi-
dent and the governance situ-
ation, the climate for progress
will improve.

As for student social life,
Duff believes most students
are better off than they think.
Again, however, the closeness
of the small community works
against the student. If, for
example, two people of the
opposite sex are seen together
often, whether it really is a
“romance” or not, soon they
are ‘‘expected”’ to be together.

Duff is glad that he had the
chance to work in three diffe-
rent areas of the college.
Working from the different
angles made him really aware
of the special types of prob-
lems each administrator he
worked for had to face.

“T’ve really appreciated the
people that I’ve worked and

lived with. I’ve learned a lot

from everyone that I probably

wouldn’t have had a chance to

experience otherwise. But now

I know that its time to go.”
Lay on, MacDuff.
