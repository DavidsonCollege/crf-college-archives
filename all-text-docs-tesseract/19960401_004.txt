Students come together to Take Back the Night

By CATHERINE ANDERSON
Staff Writer

Tuesday evening, hundreds of
students and faculty gathered in
the 900 Room to hear several
womens’ tales of sexual assault
and rape at the seventh annual Take
Back the Night.

Sponsored by the Women’s
Issues Committee as a part of

Women’s Month, the event is de-’

signed to empower women to deal
with past experiences and put them
behind them to overcome sexual
oppression.

The program parlayed stag-
gering statistics of rapes on col-
lege campuses: 10-30% of college
women are victims of rape, the
chances that a woman will be raped
in her lifetime is one in four, and
one in three women will be the
_ target of an actual or attempted
rape.

Several women came to the
front and communicated their sto-
ries in various ways, from direct

accounts to poetry readings to dra-
matic presentations.

“T think it was the most pow-
erful Take Back the Night we’ve
had thus far,” says Health Educa-
tor Georgia Ringle. “It was a won-
derful mix of true stories, poetry,
performance art and music. I think
it really reached out to the audi-
ence, and they felt very comforted
and reassured by the numbers com-
ing forward. I was greatly moved
and personally proud of all who
participated. I think it shows how
strong these women are.”

Joselyn Schultz, chairperson
of the Women’s Issues Commit-
tee, agrees. “I was really happy
with it. There was a fantastic at-
tendance, and a real push toward a
positive feeling. There was defi-
nitely more uniting with the crowd

and a feeling that we can do some- ~

thing, taking from the strength and
courage of the people on stage.”
Junior Kate Caputo shared her
experience with sexual assault and
hoped to leave the audience with a

specific message:

“If someone ever forces you
to do something, although it’s not
rape, it’s sexual assault and it’s
wrong.”

Junior Elyse Weitman spoke
as well. “I was in absolute awe,”
she says, “with the number of guys
who were there. It means so much
to see them there supporting us.”

Of the night Weitman says,

"I'm very proud of the emer-
gence of a voice on campus that
makes of asad cry, a silent scream,
and of an unsaid lament, a fierce
denonciation of the unspeakable
violations of human dignity," says
Spanish Professor Magdalena
Maiz-Pena.

"At Take Back the Night,
Davidson students reclaimed the
bodies and names of the victims,
yelling "Basta" (it's enough) to the
fear, silence and loneliness they

. had."

Despite weeks of uncooperative
weather which have delayed construc-
tion, graduating seniors will still be
able to attend the dedication ceremony
for the college’s Habitat house.

They’ Il just be doing it in the fall
when they return for Homecoming
instead of this spring before Com-
mencement. Organizers now concede
that construction will not be com-
pleted in time for a dedication this
year.

Several members of the commu-
nity have been lined up to oversee
construction during the summer, so
that faculty, staff and students who
will be in the area can still come out to
work,

Also, incoming freshmen par-
ticipating in the Odyssey, which will
be going on throughout the summer,
will do construction as part of their

service.

And there is plenty more activ-
ity planned this semester. The energy
level will increase April 15 to 19
during a week-long “Building Blitz.”

There will be construction at the

site every day in an all-out effort by}

campus volunteers, and a group of
seven high school students from Bos-
ton will also help.

Fundraising has not been ham-
pered by the weather. Responses to a
phone-a-thon last week were very
positive, with “Hammerhead” vol-
unteers raising more than $3,000. If
you know of anyone who would like
to donate materials or services for the
house, please call Dr. John
Wertheimer (-2582). Organizations
that wish to have a group workday at
the site should call Katherine Cooke
(-2298).

Many students participate in
the numerous community ser-
vice options that Davidson pro-
vides, °

Catherine Turner, commu-
nity service coordinator, says,
“So many students are involved,
and that’s something that other
schools want to emulate.”

Reach Out is instrumental
in providing service opportuni-
ties for Davidson students, Reach
Out President Katie Brasfield
says, “Reach Out is the umbrella
student organization for
Davidson College’s 22 student-
run service programs.”

The program’s areas include
homelessness, housing, educa-
tion and tutoring, service trips,
work with senior citizens, pro-
grams for children,’ recycling,
health related programs, and hun-
ger awareness.

Reach Out is sponsoring a
barbecue dinner at the Ada
Jenkins Community Center on
National Youth Service Day,
April 23.

A spring cleaning project at
the Senior Nutrition Center pre-
cedes the dinner, and Habitat for
Humanity will build that day.

Reach Out Vice-President
Bill Abrams says, “We are join-
ing millions of adults and young
people nationwide in the celebra-
tion of the power and vitality of
youth in our communities.”

. Every Thursday Reach Out
plans a CROP lunch in the 900
Room from 11:30-1:15 in order
to promote issues of hunger.
Contributions received go to or-
ganizations that help hunger
worldwide and locally.

Habitat builds every Thurs-
day afternoon and all day each

‘Saturday. April 15-19, they will

be building everyday.

Patterson Court also orga-
nizes service projects. The Eas-
ter egg hunt on Sunday, March
31 was a Patterson Court spon-
sored activity. The court will be
sponsoring a “Crush” fundraiser
on April 13-14. Patterson Court
will participate in the Earth Day
celebration on April 22.

Brasfield says, “Community
service is a great way to get in-
volved with other Davidson stu-
dents as well as the community.

It provides an outlet for
people to get involved in rela-
tionships beyond the court and
classroom.”

Turner stresses the link be-
tween community service, class,
and life.

She urges volunteers to
“look deeper into things instead
of doing them and leaving them
behind. Educated people can cut
themselves short if they don’t
look for the cause of the prob-
lem.”

She says, “Making service
an integral part of your life is
what makes it really meaning-
ful.”
