Students Revolt Against New Calendar

By TOM BRUCE
Contributing Editor

After a seemingly endless
Christmas vacation, student
leaders returned to Davidson in
a head-on clash with a proposed
calendar for next year's three
terms.

The release of the 1973-74
calendar last week was the out-
come of deliberations by the
Educational Policy Committee
(EPC) and the Faculty
Executive Committee on the
feasibility of a number of calen-
dar styles.

Both forums ultimately ap-
proved a calendar proposed by
John M. Bevan, Vice President
for Academic Affairs, that
designated the winter term to
begin after the Christmas
break.

The resulting 21 week span of
almost uninteresting study was
the chief source of complaint.
Only five class days were allot-
ted as a spring break, and many
students and faculty members
felt that this unrelieved period
of work might prove fatiguing.

A study of the Bevan calendar
conducted within the freshman
class by freshman senator Mike
Pappas elicited 150 responses of
which 146 students reacted un-
favorably to the Bevan calen-
dar, while 4 students endorsed
it.

Although most of the fresh-
men criticized the scheduling of
the winter and spring terms, a
number voiced other com-
plaints. Classes the day after
New Years, a June 2 final
dismissal date, and four Satur-
day classes were prominent in
the dissatisfaction.

The reasoning behing the
Bevan calendar came to light

later in the week, despite
Bevan's absence from the cam-
pus.

Foremost was the belief held
by some faculty members that
a two-week break in the winter
term at Christmas might be un-
sound educationally.

In years past when the winter
term was split, some professors
noticed that material covered
before the break seemed
remote and stale by the time of
final exams in February.

‘*My own inclination is to sup-
port anything that doesn't have
a split winter term,"’ explained
Dick Clay, student represen-
tative on the EPC. ‘‘I feel that it
puts students at a severe disad-

vantage in many courses, such

as the introductory calculus

sequence and certain lab cour-
.

Lab courses presented
another related problem. Some
biology courses maintain a sup-
ply of laboratory animals, such
as rats and guinea pigs, which
have to be cared for during the
term. When a three week break
interrupts the winter term,
maintaining the animals
becomes a problem.

‘Our course in Genetics poses
a special problem,’ explained
David Grant. Assistant
Professor of Biology. Students
are breeding bacteria to ob-
serve long term effects. If their
work is interrupted it can
jeopardize the entire ex-

periment."
A student senate sub-
committee headed by Junior Bo

Phillips and Sophomore Blain
Butner has introduced a new
calendar to counter Bevan's
calendar.

As finally recommended by
the student senate, this calen-
dar will eliminate the long win-
ter-spring period and will
provide an 11 day spring break.

The senate's calendar, ap-,
proved unanimously this week
at the Senate meeting
designates that the winter term
start four weeks before Christ-
mas and extend six weeks after
Christmas. Fall classes would
begin on September 5 and
spring classes would end on
May 16.

Che

Vol. LXII, No. Twelve

There would be a one week
break between the fall and win-
ter terms that would encompass
the Thanksgiving holidays if this
calendar is adopted.

In addition thee would be a
two week break before Christ-
mas and classes would not
resume until January 3, so that
students would not have to rush
back to school during the New
Year's Day traffic.

Two Saturday classes would
be scheduled for sometime
during the fall term so that the
fall term would end before the
Thanksgiving break.

For the Senate's calendar to
be adopted, the whole matter
will have to be sent back to the
EPC and the Faculty Executive
Committee.

Smith Announces Basic Plans
For Future Davidson Union

By BRUCE CORSER
Staff Writer

C. Shaw Smith, Director of
the College Union, issued this
week basic proposals for a new
college union building on cam-
pus.

These proposals call for a
structure larger than Chambers
in floor space; however, the
report did not designate a site
for construction.

The conceptualized union will
supposedly be a center of ac-
tivity, not only for the college,
but also for the community as
well.

Smith's scheme for the
ground floor of the building in-
cludes a 2,700 sq. ft. Arts and
Crafts shop, and a 2,500 sq. ft.
movie theatre.

A larger area for offices and
organizations is also desig-
nated. This space will hold THE
Davidsonian, *‘Miscellany”’, the
YMCA, and N.C. Fellows among
other organizations. The Senate
_ chambers alone are a proposed
800 sq. ft.

On the same floor another
area was devised for a 6000 sq.
ft. “multi-use ballroom,”’ in-
cluding a full stage and a main
floor that will accomodate some
800 people. The student store,
larger by some 2000 sq. ft., is
also placed on this floor.

The design has the upper floor
housing, among other things,
four meeting rooms, five
private dining rooms, two party
rooms, four twin bedded suites,
a 900 sq. ft. dome room, WDAV ,
and a wall aquarium.

Smith's plan calls for a lower
or basement floor set aside for a
food service which will serve
half of a projected 1600 enroll-

ment as well as faculty-staff.
The total cafeteria is a pro-
jected 28,000 sq. ft.

A snack bar, five private
dining rooms, rathskeller, a
game area, a post office, and
rooms for the employees are
also envisioned for the lower
floor.

An outdoor area will feature
formal gardens, an outdoor food
service, a terraced lounge, and
a drama and ‘presentation
area’’.

A figure of 102,000 was set as
the total area in square feet.

Smith called the report
proposals for study. ‘‘We've had
to pull out of the air a lot of the
square footages,’ he added. He
called the plan ‘‘adaptable”’ in
that many things could be omit-
ted if there was not enough
money or interest.

Smith announced that College
President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. had been applying presure
on him to finish these proposals.

‘‘What we need now is second
look in a hard-nosed way in or-
der to mull over particular
areas,’ he said. ‘These
proposals will be studied by
designated members of the
union board and by the SGA.”

Specifically, two committees,
an ad hoc committee composed
mostly of freshmen, and a
student government social lite
committee, will further in-
vestigate the proposals. More
definite plans will be ready by
mid-March. =

Referring to the union survey
last fall Smith related that the
proposals correlated ‘‘in a
general way" with the survey.

“The things that students
knew, wanted, and that made
sense rated high in the survey,”
he said. ‘I'm pushing hard for

things that students aren't
aware of but that a union could
offer.’’

As for the realistic possibility
of the plans being approved,
Smith stated, ‘‘No, I could
never dream that this could be
approved in totality. But if you
don't include those areas im-
portant to some people or to
everyone, the chances of get-
ting thos¢areas are prettyslim.

“I don’t want anybody to get
discouraged in thinking that
just because we can’t have
everything proposed, that we'll
get nothing,” he continued.
‘‘What we'll get is the residue.”

Smith emphasized, ‘‘If this is
just a fun and games thing,
