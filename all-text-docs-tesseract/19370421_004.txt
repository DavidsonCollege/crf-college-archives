The Come-a-Runnin’ Boys

ND why, pray, shouldn’t it be pretty constantly
in the mind of

A a Davidson student that he’d
like to hop over to Charlotte tomorrow? There are
lots of reasons for his wanting to, without count-
ing one that could be discreditable.

So they come,‘ in quantities. And sometimes

they're so joyous at an escape from routine that
they come a-runnin’,

And most of them (wé sus-
pect) come fight straight to the hotel here, where
they have the Main Dining Room and its good food
and music, its dancing—or they come to The Tav-
ern where they fraternize with fellow-Davidson-
ians who had the same good idea.

We like to have ’em—and they know it.
