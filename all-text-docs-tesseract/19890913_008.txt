Hallelujah! The 1989 Wildcat
football team finally got what
had eluded them for nearly
two years--a victory. Satur-
day’s performance was not
just a win, but a decisive 15-0
shutout.

As the final seconds of the
fourth quarter ticked away
and it became apparent that
the Wildcats would pull off the
win, the Davidson crowd
(which actually stayed for the
whole game) rose to its feet
and voiced its satisfaction. It
had been a while since they
could do that, especially on
opening day! The last time

Junior Bryn Robinson, #27, breaks two tackles in Davidson’s 15-0 victory against Millsaps last Saturday.

Davidson won a football game
was in 1987. The last opening
day win was in the 1980 sea-
son.

At the beginning of the first
quarter the Davidson defense
firmly established itself by foil-
ing nearly every Millsaps at-
tempt at advancing the ball.
The defense led by linebackers
Harry Schiavi, Bret Hammet
and Eric Moledor and lineman
Kenny Nazemetz, would goon
to harass the Majors for most
of the day. The Wildcat de-
fense allowed Millsaps only
190 total offensive yards.

After their first offensive
series, Millsaps was forced to

punt. Ralph Isernia received
the ball on the Davidson 30
and returned it 30 yards to the
Millsaps 40. That runback
helped set the tone for the
Wildcat’s offense.
Quarterbacks Matt Matheny,
and Mark Wainright worked’
in tandem to methodically di-
rect the offense during the first
half. Unfortunately, on several
well-constructed _ drives,

costly. penalties kept the bal
out of the end zone.
Freshman kicker Jamie
Brown put the Wildcats on the
board late in the first quarter
with a 33-yard field goal. This
first score was welcomed by a

shower of cheers and marsh-
mallows from the Davidson
fans. Brown went on to boot a
44-yarder in the second quar-
ter and a 35-yarder later in the
fourth quarter to ice the vic-
tory.

Saturday also marked the
debut of the “twelfth-man”
kickoff team. This unit is made
up of a large number of
walkons who defend on kick-
offs. Sophomore Jebo Barnes, a
football letterman, described
the idea as one that many big
universities have used.

getting too tired on kickoffs.
The unit should be in full force
next Saturday.

After taking a 6-0 lead into
the locker room, the Wildcats
came out storming. The de-
fense continued to blitz and
pulverize the Millsaps back-
field throughout the second
half.

The defensive attitude of the
Wildcats was evident in a
fourth-quarter series in which
Davidson was penalized for
roughing the passer. The next
play saw the quarterback once
again levelled, this time while
holding the ball. .

Midway through the third
quarter, behind the powerful
running of tailback Bryn
Robinson, who averaged 5
yards a carry on the day, the
Wildcats engineered a 96-yard
drive. The drive was capped
by a 20-yard touchdown strike
from Wainright to Isernia. The
score stood at 12-0 after a
failed two-point conversion.

The Davidson offensive line
turned in a stellar perform-
ance, clearly dominating in the
trenches and leading the Wild-
cat runners to a 215-yard rush-
ing performance. ;

The only down side of the
game was the 105 yards that
Davidson was penalized dur- |
ing the day. This kept them
from scoring touchdowns on
three or four occasions.

However, Coach Vic Gatto
did not seem too worried. In
The Charlotte Observer he cited
first-game jitters as the cause
for most of the yellow flags.

As the players headed for
the. locker room, they were
greeted by the unfamiliar sight
of fans in the stands after the
game.

The crowd found it hard to
let go of the strange sensation
of victory. They, let the Wild-
cats know justhow much they
liked it witha standing ovation
that lasted until the last player
had disappeared into the tun-
nel.

Players and fans are looking
forward to more of the same
throughout the season. Go
Wildcats!

Soccer loses more than games on roadtrip

The Davidson soccer team lost both games ona road trip in northern Virginia last
weekend. The team dropped decisions to William and Mary by 2-1 and to Old
Dominion by 3-2 in overtime.

The largest loss of the trip, however, turned out to be the loss of starting striker
Jim Walker. Walker had burned William and Mary’s sweeper fora breakaway when
he was taken out by a tackle. The impact did major damage to his left knee. He
underwent reconstructive surgery on Sunday and will miss the remainder of the
