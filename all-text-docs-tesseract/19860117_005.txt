Townshend comes clean in White City

By LEE EICHELBERGER

Pete Townshend is back with a brilliant
film/mini rock opera and album: White
City. Here, he finally resolves problems
that have plagued him since becoming a
rock star; specifically his self-obsession and
self-destruction. White City is a London
housing project that the British government
created in the 1930s as an idealistic commu-
nity for the “New British”, but in the ’80s it
has become what amounts to a ghetto.

Townshend has cast himself as Pete
Fountain, a pretentious rock musician
whose world famous group ‘Deep End’ has
recently broken up (sound familiar?). Foun-
tain comes to White City to recover a “bit of
his roots”. This is about the extent to which
the liner notes explain the situation. I sup-
pose that it’s necessary to see the film to
make a lot of sense out of it. But behind
Townshend’s muggy concept lies a solid

album of strength and passion.

Recording for the first time since 1982's
All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes,
Towshend has assembled an impressive
band including Big Country’s experienced
rhythm section of Tony Butler and Mark
Brzezicki. Former Pink Floyd guitarist
Dave Gilmour rounds out the list, playmg
and co-writing the title track with
Townshend.

The album starts out strong with “Give
Blood”, which dispairs, “you may find that
blood is not enough.” Fortunately
Townshend avoids the sly cynicism of
Cowboys when he concludes, “so give love
and keep blood between brothers.” Yet
while Towshend has put his romanticized
depression behind him in the gem “Brilliant
Blues”; “The brilliant blues / Will never
flow this way again / The color of the river
is gray” , his hopes are materialistic and

strangely empty, “It’s time to give / So
don’t betray me, pay me.”

But by “Face the Face”, it is evident that
Townshend’s alcoholic haze has evapo-
rated into a clarity and passion that leaves
the ears ringing with Brzezeicki’s insistent
beat. Townshend realizes his need to face
himself (‘Face the Face’) with the realities
of the non-rock world. Since, “the pursuit
of heroism, success, and homecomings had
given Pete nothing.”

“Hiding Out” describes a cityscape in
terms of Townshend’s own _ loneliness
against a mechanical beat; “I look over
chequered fields / And the towering web of
steel / Young and old will sit and judge un-
feeling / I am safe — hidden here.”

This side’s standout though is the
bluesy and chilling “Secondhand Love” (“I
want my defenses laying in your hands / I
don’t want your secondhand love”). Finally

Townshend’s despair is resolved in the
album's musical and lyrical centerpiece,
“White City Fighting”.

Intricate guitar work by Gilmour and
Townshend's beautifully layered har-
monizing highlight the track. Perhaps
Townshend's hiatus from rock prompted
the examination of his inner struggle that
fueled his albums since 1966; “The White
City / I finally grew up / To resist the temp-
tation / The gutters all threw up / But I have
to go back / I guess I’m violence prone / To
remember the White City fighting.”

Overall, this is Townshend’s strongest
effort since Empty Glass. Special credit is
due to Chris Thomas for his excellent pro-
duction work. Thomas has cut the sleekest
Townshend record ever without sacrificing
any of the sheer power that one expects
from the former Who guitarist. While you
may not hear much of this one on 95Q,
White City is one of 1985's best records.

Radio spots spread Davidson news around the country

By THOMAS NICHOLSON

The next time you turn on your
radio, you may hear familiar
Davidson voices sprinkled in with
Madonna and Springsteen.

Assistant Director of College
Relations Bill Giduz has taken
Davidson to the airwaves with a
series of short news spots focusing
on Davidson. events and _per-
sonalities.. The spots are for use
with radio news broadcasts as fea-
ture stories to elicit interest in the
college among the public.

Giduz said the “oral press re-
leases” are a chance to “toot our
own horn.” The spots are desig-
ned to get Davidson College news
on the minds of the public. Giduz
said that to the public, ‘‘a measure
of success seems to be how often
your name is mentioned.” The
spots may not directly influence

people to give money to the col-
lege, or send their children here,
but indirectly they enhance the
image of the college, he added.

Radio stations use the spots to
fill out their news broadcasts. The
Spots are not so much hard news as
they are human interest stories —
an interesting “chaser” for the
news,

So far response has been
good. Fifteen stations have been
using the spots. The N.C. News
Network also picks up the spots,
which expands the number of sta-
tions that get the spots by 87.

Giduz sent out the 40 second
hews spots to stations all over
North Carolina. The stations vary
in size and format. Rock, country,
soul and religious stations get the
spots. Top stations like Char-
lotte’s_WBCY and Raleigh’s

WPTF carry the spots as well as
smaller ones like Salisbury’s
WSTP. Al! of the stations have
substantial commitments to news
broadcast.

The first news spot concerned
Dean Rusk’s visit and speech at
Davidson’s Fall Convocation.
That spot was picked up by Geo-
Tgia stations in Athens and At-
lanta. Rusk comes from the area
around Athens.

Another spot focused on the
retirement of North Carolina’s
oldest practicing physician, J.B.
Woods, who lives in Davidson.
For this release Giduz made a spe-
cial five-minute report that was
picked up by the national RKO
news network. A conversation
with N.C. Gov. Jim Martin °57, a
former patient of Woods, high-
lighted this spot.

Giduz, whose interest in radio
started in high school with a
school news spot he produced,
said he is enthusiastic about the
spots. He called them: “a great
medium. It’s a field Davidson
hasn’t explored before, and I’m
convinced it helps.” Giduz says
the radio format is more accom-
modating, it gets news out fast.
He can send a spot to a station over
the phone and have it broadcast
that day.

Giduz explains that the actual-
ity of a voice on the radio is more
likely to grab interest than a corner
in a newspaper.

Giduz has also used students’
voices on the spots. Before Christ-
mas break, he made a spot about
Davidson students going home.
He stood in the hall and asked stu-
dents what they wanted for Christ-

mas.

The spots are hard to make.
“Jamming a report about Dean
Rusk into 40 seconds is challeng-
ing,” Giduz said. The task is com-
plicated by the fact that he likes to
do high quality work. He said he
sometimes spends one hour on a
spot, but for others he has spent
five hours trying to get it right. He
believes the high quality spots
make Davidson look good.

Giduz plans to continue pro-
ducing the spots. The administra-
tion allows him to use 25 percent
of his time on the spots. He does
not get any extra money for them,
but WDAV radio has helped him
and let him use their equipment.
Giduz said he is proud of the
spots. “Radio is an untapped pub-
licizing source for colleges — no
others produce spots regularly."
