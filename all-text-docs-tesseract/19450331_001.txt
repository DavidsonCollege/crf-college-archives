Prof. Cobbler
Cuts Classes

Students To Write Essay On
Bed-Bug

Professor E. F. Cobbler, of the
English department, told his classes
last week that he would give them
cuts all through the week. Dr. Cob-
bler_ explained in a recent interview
that he was interested primarily in
the student’s welfare, and anything
that he could do to make the stu-
dent feel at home, he would do.
When questioned by one of his more
inquisitive pupils on his change of
attitude, Dr. Cobbler gave his usual
smile and said, “You shall see.” The
explanation came this morning with
the announcement that all of his
students shall write a fifty word es-
say to make up for their free cuts.
The topic that was chosen to write
on is “The Social Standing of the
Bed-Bug in the Normal American
Home” or “Quick James the Flit.”
The deadline for the paper will be
May 30th and every student’ is cau-
tioned to have it in, on time.
