SENIOR ENGLISH CLASS
SHAKESPEAREAN CONTEST

The Independent Magazine is con-
ducting a series of essay contests in the
colleges. and universities of the country,
in honor of the ter-centenary of the
death of William Shakespeare. The
prize is to be a medal, presented to the
winner of the contest in each college. In
addition, thru the courtesy of Dr, Ful-
ton, the successful contestant at David-
son is to be awarded a book on a Shakes-
pearean subject. Some of the rules for
the local contest are as follows:

1. The contest is open only to the
members of the Senior English class.

2. The contest will close on April
25, 1916.

3. The essay .entered in the contest
is to be a discussion of Ruskin’s state-
ment that “Shakespeare has no heroes;
he has only heroines,” to be found in his
essay on “Sesame and Lilies,” under
“Lilies of the Queen’s Gardens.”

‘STUDENT BODY AND
COUNCIL ELECTIONS

At a meeting of the Student Body on
May ist, the officers for the year 1916-
17 will be elected. In the ten days fol-
lowing May tst, the Councilmen will be
elected. As provided by the Constitu-
tion, the above officers will go into office
on the first day of the session of 1916-17.

According to the traditions as old as
the college itself, campaigning for office
is not countenanced on the Davidson
campus, and each man registers his vote
as his best judgment dictates. Fervid
appeals from time to time in the past,
for the political campaigning spirit which
is found in some colleges, has met with
no response and it is probable that the
vote will continue to be that of indi-
viduals and not of groups,

SHAKESPEAREAN PAGEANT.
On April 2gth the Queens College

girls and several of the Davidson stu-
dents are to give a Shakespearean pag:
eant in the Queens College auditorium.
A great deal of attention is being given
to details in costuming, since the whole
performance is to be a series of tableaux.
The characters which the Davidson boys
will represent have not heen definitely
decided, but W. A. Dumas will probably
be seen as “Prince Hal:” L. A. Mullen
as “Shylock ;’ W. G. Morrison as
“Shakespeare :” J. L. Payne as “Romeo,”

and W. C. Copeland as “Falstaff.”

NEW Y. M.C. A, CABINET
BEGINS YEAR'S WORK

At the meeting of the Y. M. C. A.
on last Thursday night the new cabinet
took charge of the work for the coming
year. The aim and scope of the work of
a college Y. M. C. A. was outlined by
the incoming president and a plan pro-
posed to give each member more individ-
ual work to do and thus increase the in-
terest in Association affairs. Special
music was rendered by several members
of the orchestra and in the songs in the
service the Alexander song books were
used.

A moving picture show will be opened
up in about ten days in the building be-
low Long’s grocery store. This will be
controlled by Messrs. Fetzer and Tor-
rence. Work on the remodelling of the
building is in progress, and the machine
has already arrived. This building will
seat about soo people. Coach Fetzer
announces that they intend to have a
first-class house, showing the best films.

DAVIDSON VICTORIOUS

(Continued from page 1)

avoidably prevented from serving, the re-
maining three judges, Hons. J. P. Hol-
lis, J. H. Marion and E. R. Preston.
constituted the committee.

On account of the unfavorable weath-
er the attendance was not as large as
expected. The Winthrop girls were
present in large numbers and gave fre-
quent and hearty applause to both teams.

The instrumental and vocal music, in-
cluding a selection by the Mandolin
club; the efficient arrangement of the
details for the debate by the chief mar-
shal, Miss Louise McCown and her as-
sistants; and the services of Professor
Brown as presiding officer were appreci-
ateck by all and especially by the speakers.

While in Rock Hill the teams and the
judges were entertained by the Rock
Hill Chamber of Commerce. The hos-
pitality and generosity of the Chamber
of Commerce is appreciated by the de-
bating teams of both colleges. rp. H.R.
