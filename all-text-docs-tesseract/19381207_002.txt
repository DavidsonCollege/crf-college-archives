Editorial Dilemma

In every college there is always some sort
of dissension between the administrative
department and the student body. The cause
of the trouble usually arises from the atti-
tude of the students themselves. They can
see only their side of the problem; they
feel that they are getting a raw deal in
many respects and would honestly like to
know the reasons for some of the restric-
tions placed upon them, In referring to the
students in this manner we do not imply
that the student body as a whole has this

—a nice little theory. We would be only
too glad to publish an editorial or letter
from a faculty member explaining why the

sure that the students would them

a big part in the student’s life and it seems
too us that a paper representative of the

college should recognize the fact. How-
ever, we have yet to see one that does.
It is indeed an editorial dilemma. The

faculty advises cutting student criticism to
a minimum; the students feel that unless
their opinions are fully expressed they are
being deprived of their rights on their own
paper. The editor has to take a stand some-
where between these two points of view.
We don’t like to feel that we are merely
“stooges.” We don’t want to be biased in
giving only one side of a problem. ‘“Editori-
al dilemma” is right!

Background

We recently read a statement made by a
famous feature writer to a group of journal-
ism students that might well nave been
made to any college student. The state-
ment was this, “You must have back-
ground.”

Development along any line is impossible
without background. A college student who
lacks it will never get ahead. He will al-
ways be cramped and perhaps haunted by his
failure to have acquired such information
as he finds he needs. It is never too late
to do this, but the sooner the better. Two
or three years can be a big~ handicap.

It is uhiversally admitted that dne of the
greatest faults of—edtreational—institutions
today lies, not in the lack of available back-
ground, but in the failure. to present this
material in such a manner as to impress the
student with his need to know it. The facts
are almost useless when presented for the
sake of fact. They must be made applica-
ble to students.

College may be a four-year house-party,
but has anyone ever gone on a house-party
without at least a tooth brush-and a clean
shirt? People do, however, try\to go to
college without a text-book and an attentive
mind.

If you really want to make a good house-
party out of it, go to the movies, listen
to radio programs, use the libraries, read the
best magazines. But have a purpose; not
a specific purpose, but an all-inclusive pur-
pose, the fulfillment of which must pre-
cede special development in any field—the

acquisition of a good background.

Supreme Court

Special rule No. 1 from the student regu-
lations reads as follows: “Students are not
permitted to keep or use automobiles, or
motorcycles save when they are used by
those residing nearby to attend College
daily, or by other students only over week-
ends, and then only when cars are listed
in the Dean’s office.”

Obviously, by this rule students are not
allowed to use their cars during the week.
It also seems clear that they are allowed
to use them over the week-end if the cars
are listed in the Dean’s office. If this be so,
then why are the students not allowed to
use their cars over the week-end if they
have filled the requirements? If there were
a Supreme Court to appeal to for the stu-
dents, the restricting of automobiles as it
except dance week-ends
would undoubtedly be declared uncon$titu-
tional. But we have no Supreme Court to
appeal to, or if there is one, it has been kept
hidden. <All that we, the students, can do
is request some explanation of the present
distorted interpretation of this regulation.
If there is any doubt that this rule-has been
quoted correctly, then turn to page nine-
of the Rules and Regulations and
read for yourselves,

Dear Bill:
Every Sunday afternoon from six

the Davidson student body engage
in a grim race against time.

us time to get a snack and easily

But—when the clock points to

making Vespers on time! We know

When we finally reach Davidson,

in the rear with necessary commo-
tion, and while thinking several ir-
religious thoughts we flop into a
seat and spend, the rest of the ser-
vice trying to get our breath, en-
tirely oblivious to the sermon. The
consequences to suc\ an experience
are not limited to hé@art strain and
nervous prostration, but the college
adds the crowning blow of a third
of a cut for being tardy and a
whole one if the sermon has begun.

Now the moral to my story is not
that church should be abolished. I
am pleading only that something
be done to ease the tension on us
Sunday travelers. Why
catch an earlier bus? The answer
is simply that the only other Grey-

morning or in the very early after-
noon, denying us the pleasure of
dinner with our family or the
chance to see the object of our

There are two courses of action
for the remedy of this situation. Ei-
ther change the Greyhound sche-
dule or postpone the Sunday even-
ing services to 7:00 or at least
6:45. We do not know which would
be hardest to do, but we would like
to hear the school’s opinion on the
question.

Before we sign off, we would re-
mind the students that after a big
Sunday dinner at 12:30 and no ex-
ercise during the afternoon one isn't
very hungry at 5:30 but usually gets
a bottomless pit in his stomach a-
round 10%00 in the evening. A more
normal evening meal hour would
certainly save the students’ money
and would give the boarding houses
a longer Sunday afternoon.

“NEW GYM”
Dear Bill:

I feel that I speak for practically
the entire student body, for most
of the alumni, and a majority of
the faculty, when I express the
sincere hope that the next build-
ing constructed on the Davidson
College campus will be a new gym-

The Editor

| nasium, Not for the purpose of fur-
ther emphasizing athletics, but be-
cause it unfair the seven
hundred students registered here
and to the ones who will register
here to be forced to confine their
winter exercise periods to the pres-
ent gymnasium.

In the first place, the space which
the present Alumni Gym affords is
far overtaxed by the organized
teams which it must house. The in-
tra-mural program must shift as
best it can from periods immedi-
ately after dinner to periods im-
mediately after supper; it being a
well-known fact that exercise after
meals like this is very injurious to
health. In the place, the
freshman team has to practice at
night, simply because there ‘s no
other time. This takes away their
regular study period, which,
try as they might, they can not
compensate in the afternoon; and

Surely, there cannot be a more
pressing need at Davidson. Please
consider the wishes of those whom
the college serves and those who

Dear Bill:

tainly verified.

Coach Wade, in his preliminary
remarks, stated that he was not

By KEN LAWSON

GUEST COLUMNIST,
OVID BELL

Have you ever written a column?
I must confess that I haven't, and
I am hoping that you will suffer
my scribblings in noble silence. Ken
Lawson, your regular “super snoop-
ing” correspondent, is in the Infirm-
ary with influenza, and here I am
pinch-hitting for him in spite of
violent protests on my part to the
calm, persuasive statement by Edi-
tor Marquess that I was to be his
“guest columnist.”

The first impulse of a “great col-
umnist” is to make all those fasty
“digs” he has been saving and plan-
ning to draw from his bag of tricks
for a long time, and so I dug down
to bring out some of the choicer
ones. I dusted them off carefully,
but, alas, something told me that
Bill would censor them. before I
got started. Now into the waste
basket they go, after being cherish-
ed for so long.

In the Queen City: The lads made
their exodus Saturday, and most of
them could be found in their usual
haunts that night, For instance, 1
stopped at The Tavern, seeking
shelter from sodden skies outside,
to find several grads and_ lads
gathered about and pursuing their
favorite pastime of taking life easy.
Right in the middle of one of Char-
lie Sherman’s tall stories, a dapper
Davidson gentleman clad in rakish
costume topped off by a corduroy
“pork-pie” hat stalked in to be
greeted by the. resounding cry,
“Two-gun Latimer rides again!”

With my good ear to the ground,
I learned that Rea Tenney and Ned
Iverson had serious “date trouble”

Saturday night. “Ge-gaggie,” moan-
ed Ned, “I got left.” But Rea re-
turned to the campus, and, try as
I may, all I could get from him was
a “no dope.” Shorty Parrish, Roy-
all Branton, and John Purdie, are
reported to have sought an emer-
gency exit from a certain Charlotte
apartment house at the sound of
a passing fire engine's siren—a
case of mistaken identity, no dotibt.

Here and There: Colonel Liipfert
returned from Lynchburg with a
smile on his lips and a song in his
heart after listening to sweét no-
things murmured by the lovely Miss
Drennen—despite evidence of a
“two-time” act produced on the
Charlotte Observer's society page,
Frank Harrison and Gene Vereen
were literally bowled over by a
comely school-teacher in Salisbury
on a Sabbath evening, but “Crisco”
wouldn't tell me a thing because

. Shades of blackmail, perhaps?
Miller Sproull developed into a
sprint star, so I am told, and left
Bobbie Reinhardt on a Davidson
doorstep to be confronted by an
irate father. Addison Long was
found singing in the showers after
patching up with a lovely Salisbury
lass. Dame Rumor whispered that
a certain Miss Randolph, Pan-Hel-
lenic President Pittman’s date for
the coming dances, hails not from
Nashville—as reported to the Ob-

server — but from Jacksonville.
| Harper Beall, with the far-away
look in his eye that reaches out to

Flora MacDonald, dropped in to
bemoan the fact that he is not a
Senior.

“Sub-Deb Chatter,” that feature
eee in the Charlotte Observer
penned by doll-like Peggy Dunna-
way, yielded no worthwhile gossip

Sunday, except that it was her
birthday. That sounds more like
“helpful hints” than gossip, but,
if I'm wrong, I'll have to blame

it on my poor hearing. And I can’t
keep from wondering whether her
report of the S.A.E. party was sup-
posed to be prophetic, but perhaps
she tore herself away from the fes-
tivities pound out the latest
“dope” in the small hours of the

to

morning.

In the Groove

CANDY FROM BABY... Verily
therg must be a choice spot in the
hereafter reserved for columnists—
life is so very hard for them in this
world. Last week, for example we
were rejoicing inwardly over the
beautiful copy this proposed Geor-
gia-Watts grid classic might be
made to yield, when, just before
our deadline, one thing was snatch-
ed away from us—called off. Con-
fidentially, though, we've always
suspected that some columnist has
been behind each of the annual
dormitory feuds; certainly they
fanned the flames. in high glee.

LET’S DANCE ... This week-
end, according to usually reliable
sources, is to see the second and
final dance set of this fast-waning
semester. We might as well pass

on the observation that, at least

were naturally quite interesting,
especially since Coach Wade is tak-
ing his 1938 edition of Duke Blue
Devils to the west coast in a few
weeks for the big classic.

A few of the California’ column-
ists have criticized the selection “of
Duke and some have even gone so
far as to say that they had just
as soon see Smith College or Vassar
as the East's representative. Of
course, Coach Wade would not com-
mit himself, but there was some-
thing in the tone of his voice that
léads us to believe that those parti-
cular scribblers may have to “eat
them words.” And most of us here
at Davidson think they will, despite
the fact that U.S.C. trounced Notre
Dame. Congratulations, “Big Blue,”
and the best of luck!

Congratulations are also in order
for Fred Smith and the others re-
sponsible for putting on such an
enjoyable banquet, and for getting
up such an excellent program. Colin
Smith, Pete Marchant, and Toni
Casali were there as the Marx bro-
thers, the varsity quartet sang, the
impromptu speeches were good, Dr.
Lingle said some appropriate words,
and Dave Warden made a nice
talk. It was all good, including the
hog-calling which blasted the raft-
ers. ,

So the best of everything to the
“D” Club. Those boys deserve a lot
of credit.

Both of those were good enough
for Hal Sugg’s column three long
years ago, so they are good enough
for you. Maybe we ought to tell
you that we read Sugg in the ’35-
36 “Davidsonian” for inspiration.
Even if there’s no inspiration, it’s a
very pleasant way to pass the time
of the day, Sugg being our idea of
the ideal campus columnist. His
lines are old enough, too, to use
again in a pinch.
