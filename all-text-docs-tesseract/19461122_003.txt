OWLS DE-ROOSTED

In one of the most exciting games ever played
on Richardson Field, the Junior Varsity knocked
over Charlotte’s C.C.U.N.C. 26-20 Frday, spectacu-
larly closing their schedule. With the score tied
20-20 and only minutes to play, it looked like a
sure deadlock for the Kitty Cats, as the clock
ticked away toward the end of the season’s clos-
ing game. The Jay Vees played heads-up ball all
afternoon, coming from behind in the last quarter
to tie up the score, when end Louis Bingham
blocked a punt deep in Owl territory and Ritten-
burg, big Kitten guard, snatched the ball up to go
over Charlotte’s C.C-U.N.C. 26-20 Friday, spectacu-

cats failed to make a first down, Forman faded
back to his own 15, tossed a desperate pass which

snagged the ball on the 35, racing over for the
final winning score. The Wildcat conversion fail-
ed. Stepping all over the place for the Kittens
in the backfield department, were Charlie Miller
and Charlie Rimer.-Rimer ran with speed and
hard hitting power, bulling his way through
the Owl line. Standing out in the line were Ted
Keesler, Fred Prior, and Louis Bingham, though
it cost little Bingham a few loose teeth in ‘pay-
ment for that beautiful fourth-quarter punt block.

LAST WEEK’S FOOTBALL

The Furman Hurricane took a 20-6 slashing at the

class, among

hands of Clemson’s Tigers last week. The Tiger’s claws
punctured the Purple Hurricane: and just about let all
the wind out. Except for an 85 yard return of an in-
tercepted pass by Tom Wham, Hurricane end, it was
Clemson’s day all the way.

South Carolina’s dreams of a Southern Con-
ference Championship were smashed last Saturday
as Duke rolled over the Gamecocks 39-0. Wake
Forest took a beating from North Carolina and
N.C. State romped over the University of Va. 27-7.

A scrappy

Bees

In one of the closest battles seen
on Richardson Field this year, the
Kittens rolled up a lead in statis-
tics as well as the score. -An-air-
minded Charlotte eleven completed
eight of fifteen passes while rack-
ing up 11 first downs. Coach Jack
Sparks’ boys stuck mostly to the
ground and moved the yardsticks a
total of seventeen times.

First Quarter Score
black jerseyed Bees drew
blood midway in the first
quarter. The Owls lost the ball
shortly after the opening kickoff
when Goat Davis fumbled on the
Davidson 35. The Kittens drove
to the Charlotte one where they
were thrown back by a vicious line
led by Bob Condor. Benton kicked
out to little Dave Erwin who raced
back to the 25. Erwin hit right
end for four, then Charley Rimer
cracked the middle and out-manéu-
vered the secondary for the initial
tally. Page Jackson failed to con-
vert.

With Boger and Davis running
and Foreman passing, the Owls
worked the ball down to the seven.
On a freak play in which the Owl
backfield missed its signals, Boger
crashed the center to pay dirt.
Boger also failed to convert and
the half ended in a 6-6 tie.

The second Davidson score was
set up by Prior’s first interception
as he wormed his way to his own
30.. Charley Miller skirted left: end
for 40 yards. Rimer and Erwin,
Coach Sparks’ “Mr. Inside and

down to the Owl 25 from where

Displaying some of the flashiest
football seen on the interfrat grid-
iron this year, the K.A.s swept
over the S.A.E.s in a crushing 246
win. This put the big gold team
at the top of the pile. At present

But if the lose to the
K.A.s, it will put them in a three
way tie for fourth place with the
Pi Kapps and S.P.E.s. The Pi
Kapps also started off at the bot-
tom of the pile, but came up at
the end of the season to finish out
above the .500 mark. The scrappy
Pi Kapps proved to be a thorn in
almost every team’s side all
through the season. They forced
the Phi Delts to play overtime,
and just did lose to the K.A.s by
a slim one touchdown margin. And
in the course of their schedule,
they managed to come through and
lick both the S.A.E.s and the Betas.
