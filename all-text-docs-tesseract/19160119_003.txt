ORCHESTRA PROSPECTS.

The outlook for the Orchestra and
Glee Club is very promising for the
Spring term. “The Orchestra has suf-
fered the loss of one of their most prom-
ising members, McDufic, who did not
return after the Christmas holidays.
The Glee Club has more good material_,
than it can use.

The manager of the club is making
arrangements for two trips this Spring.
Although the details of the trips are not
yet known, still it has been definitely de-
cided that one of the trips will be up
towards Asheville and the other will be
into South Carolina and the eastern part
of the State.
