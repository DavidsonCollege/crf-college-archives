Heels exhibited

deception, power,

tackles and swept the ends.

Andy Bershak lived up to his rep-
utation and played an All-Ameri-
can game when the ‘Cats
were punting. On kick plays Bill
Bolin’s assignment was to stop Mr.
Bershak said Bershak got
about as far through Bolin as he

Frank Purdy, 145-lb. center of the Wildcat eleven, proved his
ability Saturday by playing a bang-up game against a heavy Caro-
lina team. Although little, as compared to opposing centers, Purdy
has continually led his team, and has been one of the mainstays, es-
pecially in backing up the line. An official of the Davidson-State
game referred to Frank as “A Ball of Fire in the Davidson Line.”
