‘Cats take 2-0 record to weekend tourney iy

By BERT MOBLEY
Sports Editor

Davidson College has a
young basketball team in a
young season. But the young
season is 2-0 and the. young
team is “eliminating mistakes
and putting their feet on the
ground” according to Wildcat
coach Eddie Biedenbach.

Davidson opened last Satur-
day in Johnston Gym with a
lackluster 88-78 win over lowly-
regarded Wofford. Monday
night, however, saw an exciting
come-from-behind win over
Southern Conference opponent
Virginia Military at ‘The Pit”
in Lexington, one of the most
hostile arenas in the league.

The young team has little
chance to grow before opening
in the First Union Tournament
against one of last season's top
four, Pennsylvania. Penn, with
Tom Leifson of Sports Illustra-
ted fame, may not be as tough
as expected because they lost
four of their starters because of
graduation. Moreover, the Qua-
kers opened thi son with a
88-58 loss at Wake Forest.

“I scouted that game,”’ Bie-
denbach said, ‘‘and Wake is
awfully good, but Penn’s pretty
good, too. They weren’t beaten
as badly as the score indicates.”
Davidson plays Friday at 7
p.m. The Cats hope to meet the
winner of the UNC-Charlotte
vs. Oklahoma State game Sat-
urday at 9 p.m. in the cham-
pionship game. The baat
begins at 7 p.m.

Other action next week. in-
cludes Western Carolina Mon-
day night in Charlotte and
Eckerd on campus next Wed-
nesday night.

The Cats are indeed a young
team this year with three sen-
iors, one of whom starts, one

‘junior, six sophomores, and
four freshmen. One of the most
pleasant aspects of this two-
game-old season is the play of
the freshmen. Coach Bieden-
bach started John Carroll in
both of the games and went to
his bench often for Rich Wilson
and Cliff Tribus. So far, the
results have been, to say the
least, desirable.

Carroll has added 14 points to
the Cats’ effort while Tribus has
scored 20, 18 of those coming
against VMI. Wilson has scored
one basket so far—one at’ the
buzzer to pull Davidson with in
two at halftime against VMI.
The fourth freshman, Casey
Ranam, left campus unexpec-
tedly last Saturday but has
returned to school and to the
lineup.

Another pleasing aspect of
this season has been the play of
sophomore Rich DiBenedetto
who sat out last season after a
fine freshman year. He opened
the season with 40 points
against. Wofford and saved
Davidson from what some

would call.‘'a most embar-
rassing defeat."’ He added 1) at
VMI.

‘*‘Wofford's man-to-man a-
gainst DiBenedetto under the
post didn't work and we were
getting the ball to him and
scoring,’ Biedenbach  ex-
plained. ‘‘VMI had him double-
teamed, and he couldn't do very
much. He’ s got to learn to
move.’

A third positive aspect of the
season so far is the play of the
“regulars."’
aging 16 points and 10 rebounds
pér game, Todd Haynes has a
13 point average with 8.5
rebounds. Ernie Reigel is ad-
ding 6.5 points per game, The
depth of the bench has also been
instrumental the. first two wins.

Even with the two victories,
Coach Biedenbach Said, ‘*We've
only played well for about seven

Jamis Hall is aver-

minutes. VMI took advantage
of the mistakes we made a-

gainst Wofford. I'm disappoin-

ted we got in the position we did
where we had to come back. We
finally delivered some clutch
shots and played good defense
and pulled it out.’’ Davidson
was down by eight with seven
minutes to go.

Biedenbach points out, how-_

ever, that the mistakes may
have turned out for the best.
“What we were telling them to
do differently against Wofford,
they found out for themselves
at VMI."

Learning is a vital ingredient
for this team, and the young
players themselves recognize
this. ‘We've got to learn to play
together,’ Carroll said, “and
learn each other's moves. I've
learned a lot of basketball since
I've been here.” Tribus added,
“We've just got to learn and
keep getting better. Hopefully,
we can keep on improving.”

“| don't really think of myself
as a freshman,’ Wilson said. *‘!
enjoy playing, and I'm contri-
buting. That’s about all I can
ask."

The Davidson field hockey
team carried their 7-6 record to
the Division II State Tourna-
ment at Winthrop College in
early November with high ex-
pectations after their regular
season and came away withe
some high individual honors.

The Wildcattes first oppo-
nent was Catawba College who
had previously defeated the
Davidson team 3-2 in overtime.
The Cattes emerged victorious
3-0.

Advancing to the semi-finals
after resting a mere one and a
half hours, the team put up a
valiant fight against the num-

ber two seed, Pfeiffer College

but eventually bowed to the
fresh Pfeiffer squad 1-0. This

‘loss eliminated DavidSon from

the State Tournament; the
team, however, went on to play
in the Deep South Tournament
also held at Winthrop. ,

The purpose of the Deep
South Tournament is to select
three teams of All-Star players

Women’s b-ball opens with victory

By TOM PAFFORD
Staff Writer

The Davidson Women’s
basketball team opened their
season on an auspicious note
Tuesday night when they
soundly drubbed Converse Col-
lege 65-28, in Johnston Gym.

Evidently buoyed by the
prospect of seeing the end to
some lean years in the women's
basketball program, Coach Su-
zie Roberts said, ‘I’m very
optimistic about the season.
I've never. been as excited with
the potential as this year." She
stopped short of predicting. a
final record, saying only that
she expects ‘‘a winning sea-
son.”

She has good reason for
optimism. The Lady Cats man-
aged to “defensively control the
entire game,’ and back this

currently enrolled in Professor
Abbott's Advanced Writing
class, said, “‘I'm going to learn.
I think by the time I take over
the editorship (in the spring),
I'll have good judgment."’ Pid-
geon added that they would be
helped by German Professor
Julius Winkler, permanent fac-
ulty editor. of The Miscellany,
though Roberts stated, ‘I don't

quite know what our status is in-

regard to him,”
’ In previous years, The Mis-

collany has had a national
emphasis. advertising for-sab:*
‘better publicize

missions in: Thy Writer(a: major

writing periodical) and. publish-

ing: short stories and poetry
from all areas of the country.

Meanwhile, Davidson input has
been slight. Roberts believes
that since The Miscellany is
funded by the Activities Tax
Council, students should be
better represented within its
pages. While continuing to
solicit and accept manuscripts
from outside Davidson, he and
Pidgeon want more students to
contribute.

“There is enought good stud-

“ent. writing to compete,” he
_ said. “The problem. is people.
-. just don’t contribute.” Pidgeon,

absence of returning regulars
Kirby Owen and Anna Hutchin-

32 points, Mitzi Short: had. 10,
and Mike Frankhouser domi-
nated the boards.

The starting lineup had Carol
Heppner and Mitzi Short at
ywuards, Mike Frankhouser at
center, and Sarah and. Jean
Womack at forwards. However,
Coach Roberts said this lineup
was ‘“‘definitely subject to
change because Kirby Owen
and Anna Hutchinson could be
starting” in later games.

This brings out the team’s
strong point—depth. Roberts
stated “We are ‘about ten deep.
Nobody's really tooweak to —
start. The potential's there, all
they need is confidence." She
added that the first games of
the season—the first five in
Johnston Gym-—will hopefully
afford a chance to give everyone
some playing time and get the
team settled before the hardest
part of the season in January.
