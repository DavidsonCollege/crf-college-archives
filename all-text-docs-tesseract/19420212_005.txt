THE DAVIDSONIAN

Page Five

—Question Of
The Week

rhe most recent innovation to the
Davidson has been the
Swing Concert of last Friday after-
noon. With this in mind your re-
porter sets himself to- the task of
finding out the pros and cons to
the query ‘What is your opinion of
the Davidson Swing Concert.”

campus

Dick Kelly seemed a good pros-
pect from whom to get ,a_ ffank
opinion (not only that, he lives on
the ground floor), so | approached
him. Here are Dick’s opinions “The
concert in Chambers was definitely
a step in the right direction. Maybe
the tr of the schdol now real-
ize that the walls of the building
will not cave in when popular music
is played on the campus and we can
have all our dances here at David-
son. Now, more than ever, it seems
to me impractical and utterly foolish
to have to go to Charlotte for our
dances.”

Finding-~Southgate_Jones’—door
door unlocked, I cornered him for
these remarks: “It seems to me
that in the light of its reception
and the attendance, the concert was

well received and an assured suc-
cess. To be sure it seemed a little
strange for swing music to be com-
ing from the stage where there had
been preachng a few hours before
but this is natural and this feeling
should not in any way be termed
irreverent, Chambers Audi-
torium is not essentially a church.
I cannot see any real reason why

since

the faculty should object to such}

programs in the future for they add
to the color of the week-end and
give a preview of. what to expect
from the band,” :

Packing my overnight bag, I
traveled down to Duke Dorm to
get the opinions of Jack Behrman,
Jack said “The first. Swing Concert
on the Davidson Campus was in
its major aspect. a flop! It was
out of place. The type of music was
not right, or was it the band?| If
another such concert is to be held
it must have student planning; it
must not be left to showmanship
of such poor talent as Powell’s.”

Continuing Jack said, “All right,
maybe the audi was ily
restrained, but then if we had a
suitable place such as a new gym,
we could show our appreciation: for
that branch of music that is cer-
tainly not the least popular. There-
fore if we are to enjoy a concert
of swing, we must have an appro-
priate place, student supervision or
requests, and unrestraint in showing
appreciation of good showmanship.”

Thinking I was going to hear a
recording by Gene Krupa, I opened
a door only to find Joe Barnwell
breaking a few sticks. In between
beats I managed to get this from
Joe:” What do I think about the
Swing Concert in the auditorium?
I think it was really mellow! The
band really “sent” me as it did
most of the others present. . I was
glad to see the faculty represented
and Dr. Harding will certainly get
my Swing is looked upon
by some of the older generation as
being an immoral indulgence, but
that is being awfully  narrow-
minded. Chambers Auditorium is an
ideal place for a concert, for swing
as well as for the classics; I per-
sonally would like to see the Pan-
Hell give more of them. The tea
dances usually turn out to be a
concert anyway. A bit of praise to
the Pan-Hell for a good dance set
and to the decorations fora swell
looking dance hall.”

vote.

Clarence McArhur was enthusi-
astic with the following: “The
Concert was a definite improvement
over the tea dances of former years.
I think it was a great idea to al-
low the band to play its exhibition-
ist pieces at a concert so as not to
become a nuisance at the dances.

Everyone seemed to enjoy it,
and the concert gave  every-
one a chance to see what to

expect at the dances. I don’t think
there was too much restraint; there
was ample opportunity at the end
of the pieces to clap and whiatle
and otherwise show enthusiasm. I
am thoroughly convinced that the
concert not only increased attend-
ance at the dances, but was a great
improvement over the tea dances
which no one ever managed to at-
tend.”

Dropping in to see Joe Martin I
received the following comment: “I
think that the concerts are a good
addition and should be continued
in the future. It gives everyone a
chance to get acquainted with the
band and to get into the groove, so
as to speak. Also-it-is convenient
for those with dates who come in
the afternoon, and who would ordil
narily miss the tea dance. It is
also convenient for those who don’t

“It is no time,’ he said, “for those
who scoff at peace proposals and
say that peace will take care of
itself after the war is over. Peace
is based on the Christian r@igion.
This Christian religion, the balm
of Gilead, must be applied to public
as well as private, international as
well as national, life.”

Some of the features of a desir-
able peace, Dr. Gwynn Said, were
a guarantee freedom
to all, civil liberties, complete dis-
armament of aggressor nation and
eventually, of all nations, and free
and unhampered exchange of goods

of religious

and services through the world.
Russia, he said, was a problem.
Communism is opposed to Chris-

tianity and we must not forget that
in thinking of Russia as our ally.

Dr. Gwynn advocates a_ large
police force to’ persuade Russia to
abandon Communism and_ to dis-
arm after the war.. The three great

United States, and the British Em-
pire, must be the leaders of dis-

people are the descendants of a

small town in the Cottian Alps.

that they might find a home free
