Smith and Boggs Defeat Rutgers
Team and Lose 2-1 to
Middlebury

BUCKNELL NON-DECISION

Very Impressed With Oxford
System at Middlebury

The return of Robert H. Smith, Jr.,
and Wade Boggs, a Davidson debating
team, from a Northern tour added fur-
ther laurels to this years Forensic rec-
ord, This week will also see a David-
son debating team meet Georgia Tech
on the campus, Thursday evening.

Smith and Boggs defeated the Rut-
gers team by a unanimous vote of the
judges, were defeated 2-1 at Middlebury
and fought a non-decision battle at Buck-
nell. A few days before leaving, this
same team defeated Southwestern Uni-
versity, on the campus.

The debaters met Rutgers, at New
Brunswick, N. J., on March 27 and de-
bated Bucknell in Louisburg, Penn., the
following night. On April 3rd they de-
bated Middlebury, in MiddJebury, Ver-
mont, takifg the negative side of the
query: “Resolved: That the Nations
Should Agree to Prevent the Interna-
tional Shipment of Arms and. Munitions”
in all three debates.

Their best debate, so the speakers state,
took place at Middlebury, where they
met their leading team, in the Oxford
System. This system calls for a ten-min-
ute affirmative speech, followed by 15-
minute negative, affirmative and negative
speeches in order. At the end, the first
affirmative speaker gets five minutes for
rebuttal. They also report themselves
impressed with the system of judging at
Middlebury, a college which has built
a reputation for excellent debating for
itself. There are three judges in such
a system and each debator is graded on
five issues, given a possibility of ten

points on each.

The points taken
were (1) Evidence of complete under-
standing and analysis of the question;

into consideration

An immense bombshell, exploding in
the center of the Davidson campus last
March 28th, probably could not have
more effectively spread Davidson stu-
dents over the countryside than did the
coming of Spring Holidays at noon on
that day.

Throwing down their books at the
stroke of the gong on Thursday at 12:30,
nearly 600 students began their migration.

Transportation of every conceivable
variety (airplanes and roller skates ex-
cepted). was pressed into use. The
thumbing corner was quickly populated
and roads from Davidson took on the ap-
pearance of one way streets. By night-
fall a smattering of the student body
was left to stick out a five-day her-
mitage.

Practically all students within a 300
mile radius journeyed homeward. Many
residents of Georgia, Alabama, and nor-
thern Florida also looked“over their home
towns. -

By Saturday the Davidson student
body was strung out’from Massachusetts
to Miami. Most notable among the long
distance travelers were: Brad Reed, who
bummed home to Boston, and John
Siewers and “Dog Track Joe” Partridge
who thumbed into Miami Friday morn-
ing. Ab -Price distinguished himself by
setting a new all-time hitch hiker’s rec-
ord from Davidson to Philadelphia—22
hours (2 hours better than the bus.)

He defeated his only opponent, Tom
Downie, by a slight margin of 69 votes.
Treadway Purnell, who served along
with McLeod and Downie as managing
editors during the past year, had with-
drawn because of other pressing duties
about the college, and as a result, only
one ballot was required.

son College he has been active in many
phases of campus life. Besides his con-
nection with The Yowl, he feature
editor of The Davidsonian and contrib-
utes an interesting weekly column to it.

ago for the coveted honor of varsity
cheer leader.

cial fraternity and now holds the office
of secretary. As one of the Country
Gentlemen he takes a prominent part in
its functions. He also belongs in the
ranks of the Spanish Club.

Rock, Ark., is also a member of Kappa
Alpha, and was recently elected as their
president for 1936. He is a sergeant
in the R. O. T. C. unit and belongs to

Visit Queens’ Club

Sigma Eps And Sigma Pi
Sigmas In Program

About thirty students and faculty mem-
bers, representing Gamma Sigma Epsilon
and Sigma Pi Sigma, chemistry and
physics fraternities, respectively, visited
Queens-Chicora College in Charlotte on
Friday night, April 5th.

This visit was a response to an in-
vitation of the locaf™ scientific sorority
of the institution to these two clubs to
present a program to their group.

Taking “Light” as a general. theme
of the entire presentation, the two clubs
attempted to give phases of light as re-
lated to the three general themes of
science, biology, chemistry, and physics.

In addition to these papers and dem-
onstrations the recently-acquired talking
picture machine of the two: departments
was taken and three films shown
to the group. ‘This was under the di-
rection of Professors Thies and Fulcher.

Miss Grace Hubbard, president of the
Queens-Chicora club, started the pro-
gram by introducing to the audience Mat
Alderman, president of Gamma Sigma
Epsilon, who in turn took charge and,
after a brief word of appreciation, in-
troduced the participants of each act.

The program ran as follows:

1. A paper on “Biological Light” or
light as emanated by the living world.
The paper of phos-
phorescent organisms such as the light-
ning bug, ete. It was presented by Bill
Bogart, president of Sigma Pi Sigma.

Free Tea Dance And Bowery
Ball Vie For First Honors

Jimmie Poyner And Band To
Make Melody As Davidson
Enjoys Last Set

“Th’ Bowery, th’ Bowery” is a song
which rings louder and louder in the
ears of Davidson's trippers of the light
fantastic as ghis week-end’s brilliant set
of dances looms ever larger on the. so-
cial horizon.

Recollections of such novelties as
“Ants In My Pants,” and of other music
in slower tempo, furnished by Jimmie
Poyner. and his versatile crew, are still
vividly alive from the Home-coming
dances. Imaginative minds are busily at
work on the important and exhaustive
task of thinking of something new in
the way of a getup for the Saturday night
disguise.

Costumes! Costumes! Even the Poy-
ner boys will celebrate the occasion by
appearing in ancient relics. This is the
first time in the social calendar that an
orchestra consented to tune in costufne.
A cute little Virginia gal, who recently
became associated with Jimmie Poyner’s
orchestra, will do the singing for the
dance series.

Put on the old gray bonnet or some-
thing as absurd for one of the auspicious
couples will capture the crown of king
and queen of the “Bowery Frolics” at
the gala affair on Saturday night. Chap-

erones of the dance will have the colossal
pleasure of picking the lucky pair.

Costumes of the Bowery need not be
archaic, but the Pan-Hellenic president,
Mims Rogers, earnestly requests that
they be different, possessing individual-
ity.

Only oncein a great while does the
Pan-Hellenic Council desert precedent
to the extent of inviting all members
of the student body (and others attend-
ing one of the night dances) to a free
tea dance. Yes, sir, absolutely gratis.
The set tickets are, moreover, within
the reach of all and can be purchased
at a very reasonable price. These must
bought before Friday, however, or
full fare will be required for admittance
to each dance.

The formal dance will be held, as
usual, in the Charlotte Hotel ballroom,
after a departure from this custom dur-
ing the Mid-Winter set, when the crowd
made it necessary to use the Armory
for all three dances. The tea dance, as
well as the colorful affair Saturday night,
which terminates the social activities at
Davidson College for the season, will
be at the Charlotte Armory.

It'll be a swell set, so dust off yer

BAGBY LECTURES
UN PoYCHOLOGY

Carolina Professor Addresses Psy-

feriority Complex

Dr. English Bagby held an audience
of two hundred students and townspeo-
ple spellbound last Monday night, speak-
ing on “The Psychology of Public Speak-
ing” and interspersing his speech with

brilliant humorous - sallies.
Dr. Bagby began his talk with the
assertion that experience was necessary

for the best effect on an audience. Al-
though an imposing appearance is a gift
of nature, said Bagby, the application
of a few priticiples of psychology will
add much to the effectiveness of the
speech, ‘

“The message should be suited to the
audience,” emphasiaed the eminent  psy-

Bagby emphasized the value of being
late to the hall. This has a more im-
pressive effect on the audience. “After
a short introduction,” the professor ad-
vised, “walk to the rostrum and stand
a few moments looking over the audi-
ence,

“Commence with a striking statement
that goes straight to thesheart of the
subject. The introduction should not last
over two or three sentences.”

Dr. Bagby noted several danger points
that should be avoided in public speaking.
Among these

was prevarication—wan-

dering from the subject—“It is’ a pleas-
ure of no mean extent that I should be
honored by your presence, ete.”

Another was the “apology.” The speak-
er must have something to say and re-

of insincerity should be avoided, advised
Dr. Bagby.
