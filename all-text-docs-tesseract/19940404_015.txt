‘Women's tennis stands 3- 1 in So. Con.

By Tracy French
Heading into two weeks of
tough Southern Conference play,
the women’s tennis team has a 10-

5 record overall and a record of 3-.

1 inthe Southern Conference. Their
only conference loss was to
Furman, the leader in the confer-
ence, but the team feels they can
challenge Furman in the future.
“We are performing well, right
where we should be," said head
coach Caroline Price, "We feel like
we have a solid lock on the number
two position in the conference. Al-

Men's tennis
wins seventh

in a row

With a 5-1 victory over UNC-
Charlotte Thursday, the Davidson
men’s tennis team won their sev-
enth match in a row and improved
their overall record to 13-5. Lead-
ing the charge has been junior Dan
Grinnanin the number four singles
position. He has defeated allof his
Southern Conference opponents
(6-0) and has won his last eight
matches, _

With the Wildcats holding a
5-1 conference record, they have
found themselves in atight race for
the conference lead after rebound-
ing from an.early season loss to
Georgia Southern. Along with
Davidson and Georgia Southern,

_ Furman and East Tennessee State
have solid teams and impressive
conference records.

The Wildcats will face East
Tennessee State this Sunday here
at:1:00 p.m. in a critical match for
Davidson in the conference race.
Before Sunday’s match, the Wild-
cats will face Belmont Abbey on
Saturday in a match that will be
played exclusively by the eight
seniors on the team.

though in our head-to-head com-
petition Furman won 8-1, we felt
we were competitive at six of the
nine positions. So we feel that with
a few adjustments we can position
ourselves for a run at them at the
Southern Conference champion-
ships April 15-17."

The team has had great com-
petition this year playing seven
schools in the top 100. They have
also had significant wins this sea-
son, including wins over Georgia
Tech and Connecticut.

Over spring break the team
lost to the College of Charleston 6-

' 3. The Wildcats then traveled to

Hilton Head, SC, to play Wichita
State, who is ranked number 45 in
the country. “Our goal is to be in
the top one hundred at the end of
the year, so for us to lose to them by
only 5-4 is excellent,” said Price.

The next match over spring
break was against the University
of Connecticut, whom the Wild-
cats beat 8-1. The team then trav-
elled to Greenville, SC, to face

ing home. The Cats lost to confer-
ence leader Furman, but bounced
back to take a convincing 7-2 vic-
tory over the 49ers to end the break.

Last Friday, Davidson de-
feated ETSU 7-2 for their third
conference win of the season in a
match that was supposed to be

‘tough for the Wildcats.

Five team members only have
one singles loss in conference play:
Kimberly Nance, Nicole Wilcox,
Jennifer Beahm, Natasha Ruth, and
Susannah Cobb. Two doubles
teams also only have one confer-

ence loss: the teams of Cyndi Hess/

Kimberly Nance and Nicole
Wilcox/Susannah Cobb.

Coming up this week, the
Wildcats will face Virginia Tech
on Tuesday, Appalachian State on
Wednesday, and then two more
conference matches this weekend
with Georgia Southern on Satur-
day and Marshall on Sunday. Fri-
day April 15, the Wildcats begin
the Southern Conference Champi-
onship, which Davidson will host

Furman and UNCC before return- _ for-the second year in a row.
