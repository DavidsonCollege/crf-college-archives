Freshman Blake Sends

Rocket Up 5,000 Feet

By BOB LATHAN
Davidsonian Managing Editor

All U. S. hope for catching up with Russia in the
missile race is not lost. Davidson College, it seems, has
at least one “scientist” whose reading of Sputnik has
jarred him into action.

Eighteen year old Bob Blake, a freshman from Ab-
beville, S. C., leaned back in his chair in 207 Cannon §
and unhesitatingly told of his feat.

He and Richard bDyar, a

senior at Abbeville High School,

Speaks Tonight

By LAURENS WALKER
Davidsonien Managing Editor
(By telephone from Cherlotte)

“We are running a race. We must understand this
in our thinking about Russia.”

This is the way Daniel Schorr, Moscow correspond-
ent for the Columbia Broadcasting System, summed up
the attitude that he believes the American people must
have during the years to come.

Mr. Schorr comes to Davidson
tonight at 8:15 p.m. as a lec-
turer, presented by the “Artist

Series.” A question and answer
period in the Ballroom of the
College Union will be held im-
mediately after the lecture.

Career Reviewed

Schorr comes to the Davidson
campus well qualified. He be-
gan his career as a newspaper
man in 1934 at the age of eigh-
teen. Since that time, he has
worked for the New York Times,
the London Daily Mail, and since
1953 has been a member of the

The College will receive approximately $7,000 from insurance for the burned house,
which was constructed in 1928 at a cost of $5,000; however, to rebuild the house today would
cost $31,000.

At the completion of the new fraterni‘y houses, the college plans to rent the old ones
as offices and as housing for faculty and students. The fee which the college would have
to ask for the rent of a newly-built house would be too high to Justify the reconstruction of |

Jason McManus, a 1956 graduate of Davidson, was

January 4.

McManus led his class last

Russian Party Boss.

The CBS newsman has an en-
gaging personality. He talks free-

exhibited a particular concern
over the state of American edu-
cation.

“In Russia, the students work
hard. Even high school students
must study past mid-night to do
their assignments.

“But this work is produced
by threats and coercion. We
must find some way to match
their education and yet pre-
serve our freedom. We must
learn to do voluntarily what
they do by force.”

Colvin suggested that the so-

solution that the “student body

This suggestion brought forth
