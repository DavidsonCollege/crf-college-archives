dent-faculty relationships and

Holcomb To Spea
In Chapel Monday

Dr. Harmon R. Holcomb, pro-
fessor of Philosophical Theology
at Colgate-Rogers Seminary in
Rochester, N. Y., will speak in
chapel on Monday.

Dr. Holcomb, who has debat-
ed with Paul Van Buren, ardent
proponent of the ‘‘Death of God”
theology, will speak on this con-
troversial theology, which he
opposes for “rational and phil.
osophical reasons.”

A score of 70 on the Selec-
tive Service test will allow a
student to be considered for de-
ferment by his local! board.

If this score is not met, the
student may be considered’ for
deferment on the basis of his
class standing: upper half of
his class for a freshman, upper
two-thirds of the class for soph-
omores, upper three-fourths of
his class for a junior, and if a
senior wishes to continue his
education in graduate school. he
must have a score of 80 on the
test or rank in the upper one-
fourth of his class. ;

Class standing will be based
solely on the September-June
academic year. No provision is
being allowed for work done in
summer school. At the time the
college files this report with the
various draft boards it must
state whether the student is
eligible to return for the next
academic year. Students with
delinquencies will be listed as
eligible for re-enrollment sub-
ject to summer school proba-
tion.

Mr. Hengeveld feels ‘that these
new criteria for student defer-
ment will result in an increase
of enrollment in advanced ROTC
