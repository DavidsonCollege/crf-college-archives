IRC Organizes

For Semester
McAlister-Heads—Reorganized
International Relations Club

Under the of Dr.
Frontis W. Johnston, the Interna-

sponsorship

tional Relations Club is being re-

vived this semester, and approxi-

mately twenty-five students have
manifested interest in the organiza-
tion by attending its first two post-

war meetings.
McAlister President

A meeting was held on Tuesday,
February 26, for the purpose of re-
organizing the club, electing officers,
and laying plans for the semester's
activities. At that time Johnny Mc-
Alister was elected president, Leigh-
ton McKeithen vice-president and
program chairman, and C. W. Scott
secretary. It was decided that the
club would meet on Tuesday, March
5, for its first program, and that

meetings would be held twice a

month thereafter.

Discuss UNO Charter

The topic under discussion last
Tuesday was the United Nations
Charter. Dr. Johnston prefaced the
open discussion with a talk on this
subject, with the view in mind of
better acquainting those who had
not read the charter in-its entirety
with its contents.

The purpose of the International
Relations Club is to give students
who are interested in current world
affairs an opportunity to share each
other's views and to keep informed
on international events. The general
plan of meetings is to have a .de-
signated leader discuss the chosen
topic for twenty or thirty minutes,
and then to throw the floor open
to general discussion of the subject
at hand.

Members of the club are looking
forward to a very successful and
profitable semester, since there are
so many matters of great inter-
national importance taking place at
this time. They» hope to discuss in
the future such matters as the Bret-
ton Woods Agreement, Russo-Bri-
tish differences in Indaqnesia and
Greece, and the UNO meetings in
London. ‘ !

Membership Open

This organization was formerly
operated under the bidding system,
but membership in it is now open to
all men who are interested. It is
believed that this method will en-
able the club to return more quickly
to its normal size, and at the rame
time it will guarantee the organiza-

tion a group of men who are ac-
tively interested in current affairs.

Rifle Team
Wins Honors

It has been announced by Fourth
Service Command Headquarters in
Atlanta that. Davidson's  fast-deve-
loping rifle team, coached by vete-
ran T/Sgt. B. R. Burton of the col-
lege ROTC, captured fourth place
honors in a field of sixteen clubs
the annual Hearst

competing for

Trophy award.

Davidson's five top men, all fresh-
men, plugged out a score of 836,
C. State’s 900 and
Georgia Tech’s two team scores of
871 and. 848, while the “Citadel and

ageregation was Sam D. McDaniel
of Atlanta with 178 points, only 8
below the highest individual score

of the entire competition.

Following McDaniel were Charles

Deaton with

Sgt. Burton, whose prowess as a
rifle coach is a byword at Davidson,
was with the

reasonably pleased

showing of his young team, and
states that the material now avail-
able should develop into a first-
class club by next season. Accord-
ing to Lt. Coh Howard B. Arbuckle,
formerly of Charlotte now Com-
mandant of the ROTC, negotiations
are -under way for shoulder-to-
shoulder matches this spring with

both Georgia Tech and N. C. State.

Recognized as a varsity team by
the campus athletic association in
1942, the Wildcat sharpshooters fired
a near-perfect season, defeating
Clemson, Wofford, N. C. State, and
the Naval ROTC’s at both U.N.C.
and U.S.C. and losing only to The
Citadel. During the next year, the
last season before the war closed
out varSity competition, Davidson
went on to win the Hearst Trophy
hands down.

Campus Soon To See
New Gym And-Church

Plans For Gym Are Complete;
Architect Sought For Church

President John R. Cunningham
reported to the Boar of Trustees
on February 20, that though uncer-
taintics in the fields of labor and
materials make the exact date inde-
terminate, erection of the new gym-
nasium and church at Davidson Col-
lege will begin as soon as conditions
permit.

Dr. Cunningham explained that
final.plans for the gymnasium were
in the hands of the contractor for
the study of the possibility of secur-
ing materials, and that the college
was now considering several out-
standing men in the colonjal archi-
tecture ficld in connection with the
church building, '

son Field from the North end with

There seem to be two schools of
thought the of the
church. One of these is to place the
building on the south corner of the
frout campus facing north and re-
storing the old original quadrangte:
Another idea is that if the church

pus, it will obstruct the view of the

therefore have some other location.
At any rate, the location of the

church has not yet been determined.

Funds for the new gym and col-
lege church were appropriated last
year by the college officials. Every-
one is looking forward to the large
swimming pool which will be located
in the basement of the gym. This
will certainly complete one of the
greatest needs of the campus ever
since it opened it doors to students.
The gym will carry a number of
regular size basketball courts and
volley ball courts. The new church
is another needed structure for, the

campus and its construction will add
greatly to the beauty of the campus.
