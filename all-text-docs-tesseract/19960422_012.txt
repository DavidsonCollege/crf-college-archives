Showcase highlights comedians

By Laura Wolfrom
Guest Writer

Saturday night the Union
Board sponsored Comedy Show-
case as a part of Spring Frolics
weekend. Rob Weinstein and
Gerald Kelly, comedians straight
from the heart of the Big Apple,
entertained in the 900 Room, which
was packed with humor-seeking
students.

The show began with Rob
Weinstein, who treated the audi-
ence to a session of comedy that
provoked loud laughter and ap-
plause. Weinstein’s comedy act
was characterized by clever anec-
dotes describing funny circum-
stances in everyday life. He al-
lowed students to laugh at them-
selves and potentially serious situ-
ations. Perhaps his most amusing
story was aboutatrip tothe dentist’s
office and the removal of wisdom
teeth — something that many stu-
dents should be familiar with. The
entire audience enjoyed the way in
which Mr. Weinstein presented his
stories, which were amusing, yet
inoffensive.

Gerarld Kelly followed Rob
Weinstein’s comedy act witha sig-
nificantly different show. Ac-
claimed for his performances on

MTV and his acts at the Apollo
Theater, I was impressed by the
resume and anticipated an excit-
ing, uproariously funny act. Be-
fore he began his hour-long act,

Kelly warned the audience that his -

comedy was more off-color and
would contain more raw language
than Weinstein’s act, yetnone were
prepared for some of Kelly’s crude
subject matter.

Despite his experience in the
world of comedy and his esteemed
reputation, I became quickly dis-
appointed when Mr. Kelly’s com-
edy took a turn for the worst, fo-
cusing on sex, gender differences,
and racial divisions. Although
some students took offense to
Kelly’s act, and left the perfor-
mance early to show their disap-
proval, those who remained en-
couraged the comedian to continue.
While the act was off-color in some
respects, some of his funniest ma-
terial consisted of his parodies of
other entertainers. Kelly’s interac-
tion with the audience also created
a humorous atmosphere and al-
lowed the students to involve them-
selves.

Because the two comedians

were so different, the show was*

never boring — their diversity al-
lowed the students to enjoy two
very different kinds of humor

tive organisms, bringing to mind

the theory of evolution.

The troupe also performed a
dance entitled “Sea Wave” in which
the troupe depicted several marine
organisms such as algae, coral,
crustaceans, whales, and dolphins.
The dance was “Dedicated to the
preservation and survival of the
life force of our oceans and.seas.”
Dancers undulated across the stage
in whale-like surges to the tune of
whale song. They also crawled
across the stage as crabs, feeding
on other crab-like dancers. The
dance was split into several differ-

ent plates, each depicting a certain
type of organism. Atthe end of the
piece, after a flurry of dancing, the
performers combined the different
plates to show all of the different

organisms at the same time.

The last dance of the evening
was, essentially, an improvisation
session in which each of the danc-
ers performed a short solo accom-
panied by three drummers. The
dance was a tribute to one of the
masters of West African dance,
Ibrahima Camara and acted as a
celebrating the dancers’ African
Heritage and their fine dancing
abilities.

At the end of the dance the
crowd erupted in applause, having
been thoroughly roused by the
dancing abilities of the troupe.

CD Review

Indie rock explodes with
Girls Against Boys and Idaho

By Curis MANN
Music Critic

‘ Idaho hails from Los Angeles
of all places, but their music is
notoriously melancholy and bit-
tersweet. Jeff Martin and his oddly
tuned four-string guitar are always
so forlorn and pained that their
latest outing, Three Sheets to the
Wind, was a bit of a surprise at first
glance. There are upbeat rockers
here such as “Pomegranate Bleed-
ing,” and the uplifting, bordering
on triumphant “Shame” which are
perhaps due to the fact that Martin
now has a four-piece ensemble to
back him up. On 1994’s This Way
Out, Martin more or less did it all.
Behind this more upbeat tempo on
the first half ofthe album lies highly
introspective lyrics toeing the lines
of despair, and the second half of
the album reveals a slowed tempo
to coincide with Martin’s whis-
pered vocals. Amazingly, Martin
and his mates are able to toe the
lines without coming across as
cheesy or overly-whiny (although
“A Sound Awake” veers danger-
ously close). Three Sheets to the
Wind is an album fit for an inti-
mate evening with just you and a
bottle of something fortified, the
perfect bouquet for lamenting a
lost love or for wondering why
those letters of recommendation
did, not make the deadline for the

job you really needed.

Hailing themselves as
“America’s Sexiest Sons,” Girls
Against Boys has a much more
aggressive (although no less se-
ductive) take on making music than
Idaho. House of GVSB explodes
with an aggressive, meaty rhythm
section and tasty riffage from the
opening track and first single “Su-
per Fire” onwards, crashing and
burning everything in their wake.
Girls Against Boys are machorock-
ers much like the Afghan Whigs
used to be, only with more inten-
sity, even more attitude, and so
much edge that their songs always
seem to be ready to fly apart at the
seams. This here is rock’s version
of the rebirth of the cool. Just
listen to “Disco Six Six Six” and
Scott McCloud’s tough-guy, bra-
vado-laced singing, or his sinewy
guitar-lines on just about any track,
and you will wonder what has hap-
pened to rock music. The rock
spirit lives and flourishes through-
out House of GVSB, and here’s .
hoping it continues despite this
album being their last with minor
label Touch And Go. This spirited
effort will probably be lauded years
from now, as the American public
seems to be temporarily Oasis-
blind to new music that resists pil-
fering from the past, but opts in-
stead to be something sublime and
