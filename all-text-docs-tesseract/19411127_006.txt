Robert Carter, Senior:

Those of us who saw the
two games of one football series
with Wake Forest should realize
the futility of our trying to com-
pete with them on the gridiron.

Since Wake Forest has established
her sound subsidation program,
even to the extent of W. P. A.
funds, the two schools have very
little in common. The only basis
we can possibly mention for a re-
newal of the rivalry would be
debating match. Even along this
line we should be careful, for it-is
reported that the Baptist are seek-

Paul Kissling, Senior:

I can think of no valid reasons
why we should not resume rela-
tions with Wake Forest. The very
fact that Wake Forest seems anxi-
ous to renew our rivalry should
serve as a challange that we.can-
not well ignore. True, the Baptists
have taken some of the starch out
of recent Davidson football teams,
* but as long as we continue to meet
such teams as Duke and Carolina
without asking quarter, I can find
no reason why we should attempt to
evade a meeting with the Deacons
on the gridiron. There is no ques-
tion as to our meeting them on an
even basis in other sports. I am
in favor of r ing this ancient
rivalry.

Davis Thomas, Senior:

I believe that we should resume
association with Wake Forest. They
have always been traditional rivals
of Davidson and the students of
both schools have always looked
forward to the various athletic °con-
tests between the two. Even
though they seem to have a stronger
football team at present, this may
not be so later, and as for other
sports, Davidson has as good if
not better teams than Wake Forest.
There have been numerous ‘rumors
as_to-why-we broke off_relations
with them, but none of them have
ever been verified. Each school
seems to think the other is at
fault. However, I think both schools
are now willing to overlook what
has happened in the past and once
more have pleasant but spirited
athletic association.

Bob Wood, Sophomore:
