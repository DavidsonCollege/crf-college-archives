President Hibben—“! would like to
see the Stars and Stripes planted some-
where along the Hindenburg line.”

President Wilson, in his recent Proc-
lamation to the people, makes an appeal
which vitally concerns the economies of
our nation. [f the war is of long dura-
tion the internal thrift and productive-
ness of our country will determine large-
ly the result of the struggle for us.

“Let every man and every woman
assume the duty of careful, provident usc
and expenditure as a public duty, as a
dictate of patriotism which no one can
now expect to be excused or forgiven
for ignoring.”

Then surely there is part that young
men can take which will lessen expendi-
tures. Until drawn into service, part
of the summer vacation can be profitably
spent on the farm as a productive labor-
er. But another thing is of vital im-
portance. This is to make some denial—
not of necessities but of luxuries. ‘Then
some say what are the luxuries? They
are those things which are not vitally
necessary to your comfort and enjoy-
ment. Many could be just as comfort-
able with one suit less than they are ac-
customed to have in their wardrobe.
Just as big a hit can be made without a
new silk handkerchief for your coat
pocket. Probably you have planned for
a pair of shoes which are not needed.
Many other commonplace things of
every-day life can be dispensed with.

You say why this? Because food-
stuffs and most necessities are bringing
fabulous prices. To go at the normal
rate of living a much larger expenditure
will be needed. If these extravagances
are done away with. probably the neces.
sities can be had without an addition to
the normal vearly run of expenses. We
are doing the unusual this year—we are
going to war. Our people are making
preparation for conflict and for farming
as they have never made before in our
history, We can do our part—cut down
expenses.

With many the present increase in
commodities will make no difference.
But if they will make this exception it
will not be so hard for the fellow who
is forced to it. It would be a good plan
if each one would join a league with
himeelf and adovt some method that he
will follow which will bring him to such
a system. “The Supreme Test of the

nation has come. We must all speak
act and serve together!”

RETROSPECTION AND CHANGE.

We are approaching the time of great-
est introspection of the college year. W.
are soon to examine ourselves and find
out what new relations exist between ou
minds and the world outside. Also we
are putting ourcelves in a retrospective
mood. New plans for various student
organizations and institutions are being
formulated as past experience and sys-
tem necessitate.

One thing which should be remedied
is of concern to the Literary Societies
The present scheme allows a man who is
to take some part in the program to ge:
another to substitute for him. “The one
on duty is relieve dof an impending fine
and neglects a deal of wholesome train-

‘ng because of this. ‘This is why so many |-

Seniors are speaking so often just  be-
fore Commencement. This is an injus-
tice to the should-be-speaker and to the
-ociety. If this was used judiciously: it
would be a fine plan. But it is abuse
by many. It should be that a member
Gf he is on the Hill) should do his
duty with his class or be fined unless
sufficient reason for non-performance b.
given. Some fellows boast that they
have not given a debate or have not got-
ten up a declamation. A society man
to get the best training and development
in this field should take part in both the
Saturday night and Monday morning
meeting. It is unjust to other members
because ‘there are always a few fellows
who will take a place without making
much preparation. It is an imposition
on the society to hear one man speak suc
‘essively until the limit of endurance is
reached and monotony begins. This sys-
tem is of advantage to him who substi-
‘utes but the disadvantages are far
vreater. “To those committees who arc
revising constitutions we say let us rem-
edy this error and stimulate interest in
this activity.

CONCERT ‘TO BE GIVEN
AT QUEENS COLLEGE

A. ‘I. Cashion, manager of the Os-
chestra and Glee Club, has announced a
trip to Queens College which will prob-
ably be made next Saturday. “The trip
thru South Carolina has been cancelled
on account of the war and owing to the
fact that some of the men were off th.
Hill. ‘This trip would have included
soncerts at Sumter, Bishopville, Colum-
bia and Chester. Another concert a
Queens College will probably be giver
later on. ‘This wil complete the trip.
for this year. A concert will be given
on the Hill at Commencement.

The officers for next year have re-
cently been clected. ‘hey are: A. T.
Cashion, manager; FE, P. Childs, Jr..
director, and J. L. Fowle, leader of the
Glee Club. Next year promises to be :
good one for the Orchestra and Glee
Club under these officers.

THE BAND TO GIVE
IVs FIRST CONCER1

On Friday afternoon of this week, a
5:30, the Band will make its first public
appearance. It will be an open air per-
formance and will be given in the vicin-
ity of Elm Row. Both college student:
and @own people are cordially invited tc
come.

The boys have worked hard to mak:
this organizaticn a success, in its hope
that next year, with the aid of student
body and faculty, a large band can be
organized that will be a credit to the
college.

We need a good band here—one that
the students can feel belongs to them
and one which they can call on at any

of the direct advantages to be gained from l
printing that will catch the eye and hold it long@
enough to create a favorable attitude on the part of
the buying public? Printing of the ordinary kind |
has become so weatherbeaten by unlimited usage
that the impression formed in the mind of the busi-
ness man of to-day is one of continuous and depress-
ing sameness—a tendency to cause a ‘“‘look-
arourd-more’’ disposition on the part of him who
wants something just a little different, if not entircly
distinctive, when compared with the current station-
ery that reaches his office.

DR. J. W. McCONNELL
RECEIVES AN HONOR

Dr. Wilson McConnell attended the
State Medical Society meeting at Ashe-
ville the past week. Dr. McConnell
read a paper on “Trachoma—with spe-
cial reference to its occurrence in North
Carolina,” that excited considerable dis-
cussion and comment both on account of
the character of the paper and its time-
linees, for it is feared that this dreadful
eye disease will be more prevalent after
the war.

Dr. McConnell was elected presiden’
of the Eye, Ear and Throat section of
the society, and Dr. J. P. Matheson,
secretary.
