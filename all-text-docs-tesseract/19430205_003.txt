Balls

Was set for the all-important contest

the playing floor. The boys were nervous but not tense

, The game see-sawed up and down the floor for
several long minutes, and then it began as Tommy
dropped in two from the foul line and Wayman sunk a
long shot. Davidson got hot. They hawked the ball,
guarded closely. passed deceptively as they penetrated
the Carolina zone defense and tossed them in from
all angles. The Phants handled the ball smoothly but
could not sift through the tight ’Cat defense and the'r
long shots were wild. :

it seemed that Davidson could not make a mistake
that first half. Several commented that they had never
seen a team get so hot against first rate competition,
especially a Davidson team. A twenty-three point lead
at intermission seemed pretty safe
But something happened to Carolina, Coming back for the
second period they began to’sink the long ones. The ‘Cat defense
hecame confused, Nagy able. to

as maneuver fifty position,

and the Var Heels pulled uy Shepard strbstitmted® tH FIVE tie
loys a rest, and the gap closed to nine points. But with the

Hirst team intact again in the closing minutes? theCats settled
down again, and the outeomeryas no longer in doubt

Everyone played well. Tall Tommy dominated the

play with his accurate shooting and “all-out” floor play.

~ His clever antics brought roars from the crowd. Way-

man, playing the best game of his career, was out-

standing in retrieving the ball from the backboard and

in taking runner-up scoring honors. Belk was a ball

hawk and got his share of the points. Lowry’s passing

was particularly good, while George Peters played his

usual steady game. It was a case of near-perfect team-
work.

Carolina’s comeback, which brought about the downfall of
VMI and Wake Forest, came too late this time. hey liad the
usual speed and snap of a Carolina team, which kept the °¢

ats

on their toes the whole game. Nagy proved himself worth
wf notice with his fakes and faney shooting

Looking Ahead.

Victory was sweet Monday, but-it’s still a long.
hard road to the tournament. Carolina was a tough
nut to crack in the stretch, and they will be even
tougher in Chapel Hill. Our boys usually tire quicker
in the vastness of the Woolen gymnasium. State has
the habit of winning before the home folks too, and.
with their greatly improved team will provide a second
big threat to Wildcat hopes in two days next week-end.

The’ team has shown itself warthy of presscason expec
tations, though, and they seem to be improving all along. We
would like to have seen them playing Duke on Monday. It
would have been quite interesting. But we hear that David
son can’t get another game with them. [fs also reported that
efforts to secure games with several Virginia teams have been
fruitless.

Charlotte News Poll

Ray Howe’s poll for selection of an all-time Big
Five basketball team offers a fine opportunity to gain
recognition for some of the Davidson “greats” of the
hardwood. Remember such Wildcat court stars as Jim
Cowan, Ned Iverson, Jim Hogg, J. D. Hicks, and Bill
Quick? Also consider this year’s five, with high-scor-

ing Tom eters heading the list. Send in that ballot.
“Get the spirit.”

Miscellany

Add exciting basketball games: the victory over South
Carolina (first game). Congratulations: To jake Wade for
his column on Davidson's only experience in the Soughern Con-
ference basketball tournament in correction of an error in an
earlier story. [est news of the new semester: Tommy and
George Peters getting ROVTC contracts thus assuring them of
completing the year at school and incidentially the basketball
season. Latest rumor: Davidson will definitely-have a football
team this fall (big joke). 30
