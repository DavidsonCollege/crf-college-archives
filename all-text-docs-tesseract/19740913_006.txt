TUCK IT AWAY

. Farrell Teaches Technique

Tn Pre-Season Gridiron Drill ©

The Davidson Wildcat foot-
‘tall team is fit the midst of

' pre-season practice. The

coaches and players are

building the foundation for the’

team as it enters the 1974
season. —

Since Sept. 1, the players
have been hard at work on fun-
damentals and techniques,
while the coaching staff has
been trying to put together
winning offensive and defen-
sivecombinations. —

New Head Coach Ed Farrell
is pleased with the progress of

-the Wildcats thus far in pre-.

season .
“We just have to keep
working hard in preparation

for the season,” Farrell said.
The Wildcats have six of-
‘fensive starters returning and
five defensive starters. In ad-
dition, Jim DeVille and Eddie
Womack, who had to sit ~
last season with injuries, will
start this year. Most starting
positions will be manned by

veteran: players, while much‘

of the bench support will have
to come from untested fresh-
men.

The team has lost the ser-
vices of Roger Whitley in-
definitely, due to a knee in-
jury. Whitley was to be
heavily counted on as the mid-
dle defensive linebacker.

Also injured at present is
Jerry Taylor, a freshman.

Farrell has brought with
him to Davidson a new foot-

out the egg salad again.

Mark Deaton was there,
looking worried and a bit
crazed--more. so than he
usually does, when he’s fret-
ting about the next issue of

THE DAVIDSONIAN.

“What’s up, Deaton?” I
said, egg salad sandwich well
in hand.

“Ah, it’s the paper again,”
he moaned. ‘‘We’re desperate
for columnists this year. I’m

ra ready ty anything vel

knaves and fools. Say, would

you be interested in writing a
column for us, Mitchell?”’

Well, I was speechless. Flat-
tered To be approached
(nevertheless), I recalled
something in my letter to the
editor last spring, a criticism
of THE DAVIDSONIAN ‘‘con-
descending to instruct” their
fellow students about the whys
and wherefores of national
politics. ~

On What ‘subject was I well-
versed enough to “‘condescend
to instruct’’ my pals about?

“Say, Mark,’ I offered,
‘‘how does a column about
Confederate military history
sound?”’

I was truly anguished to see
the cloud of despair that
crossed his face. No go.

“Sorry I blew up,” I ex-
plained, ‘‘but what with ol’

Lester Maddox getting whip-

ped by the good people of
“Georgia last night, my
Southern pride is a euphoria
this morning.”’

Well into egg salad number
two, I finally hit on. it=
Davidson tradition. I’m a
senior, aren’t I? .

All you have to do to become
a senior is to knock around at
this place for three years, and
I’ve knocked around as much
as any senior. And in knocking
around, we pick up the odds
and ends of stories, the in-
teresting little tales about the

characters that are the true:

heart of Davidson. :
This grab-bag of anecdotes—
“oral tradition,” John Munce
likes to call it--is pre-
eminently the province of us
grizzled ‘veterans, We havea:
duty to pass it on--a calling: ‘it’

won’t change the world, but
it’s a real rush to listen to.

I told Mark. He looked half
leery, half interested, but
never mind, he’s desperate.

Now, one of my favorite
Davidson people to tell on is
Sterling Martin, our cross-
country and track coach.

They’s stories aplenty about
Sterling, or Coach, as we call
him, and whenever the cross-

country jocks (“‘harriers” is .

the term, I believe) spin their
yarms in admiration of him,
credulity is strained. He’s
amazin’.

I’ll never forget how I first

+ encountered Coach. It tells a

lot about the way he works.
About the second ‘week of
freshman year, I strolled on
ee

"ihe man with the clipboard
was short and spare, but the
knotty calf muscles, the air of
command, and that psyching
grin left no doubt that he was
in complete control. Sterling.

“Mitchell, Paul . . -hmm-
mm. . .say, ‘didn’t you run the
half in high school?” he grin-
ned.

I didn’t know what to think.
“‘Well yes, I guess.”

I wish this was a movie,
because if it were, the scene
would cut here, and a lead-in
would explain ‘‘One hour
later.’”’ Then it would reveal
one Paul Mitchell, former
half-miler, in the middle of an
eight mile ‘‘tour’’ of the cross
country course.

_ Good grief! I didn’t even
know people ran eight miles.
That’s the way he works—
“We're gonna ‘“‘getcha!” as
the cigar commercial says

Heath Whittle used to yesget-
cha” for. the cross country
team with the fresmen cake
race. Yep, that’s how that
strange tradition was born,
over 30 years ago-to uncover
hidden runner talent.

’ And about 15 years ago, a
skinny kid dashed.from back
in the pack and ran away with
it, ‘shocking

mountains. Sterling.
He ran away from a lot of

packs before he graduated, —
but the real story’ it 'was‘his‘’’

everyone-

incredible style.
There was always a blade of
stray straw drooping from his

-mouth, ‘and the story goes that

beanies from yesterday, com
plete with cardboard wings at-
tached.

Can you beat that? Captain
Howard Boyd, °72, told me
that one, so if you don’t believe
it, see him.

Captain Rick Bell, ’75, told
about the time that Sterling
was step-to-step in a race with
a rival, and started talking to

- the boy about how his stomach

ached.

‘“‘Aw, it feels so bad,’’
Sterling moaned. Directly, the
other fellow simply said,
“Ugh’’ and dropped off. Coach
beat him by about 200 yards.

Martin was All Southern

Conference in cross country in’
’62, 63, and ’64—quite a feat,
Since that means he was
among the top five runners for,
the conference all that time.
, But that’s only his athletic
story. Off the field he was a bit
more human, and suffered the
trials of all Davidsonians.

He likes to reflect about how
he was often ‘‘one step ahead’
of the registrar,” you might
say--almost flunking out. He
was giving too much attention
to running. and to a distant
girlfriend.

“Lots of times I’d go run-
ning down the hall in Cham-
bers with a paper, rushing to
meet the deadline, and I'd see
the professor running from the
other end, trying to beat me to
the door of the office.’’

Sterling must’ve won most
of those foot-races, because he
made it through. -~ aman

Then there’s the time he had
two dates for a big weekend.
He had sent a letter to one girl,
and receiving no response,
‘asked Mary Hopkins.

Then, two days before the
weekend, C._Shaw Smith

reached in -his pocket and
withdrew a letter explaining
that he’d been forgetting to
give it to Sterling for about a
week,

ball philosophy that may be
compared to that of Don Shula
at Miami or the late Vince
Lombardi at Green Bay.

, “I believe ina basic concept

on offense and defense based
on technique,’ Farrel said.
‘“‘We need good players

willing to work hard, and I

think we have that here,” he
added. —

“We're more player orien-
ted than coach oriented,”
Farrell indicated.

’ Instead of trying to defeat
opponents by razzle-dazzle
play, the Wildcats will come
out playing sound basic foot- |
ball with well-prepared
players, a more balanced of-
fense, and more

iveness.

Another thing that Farrell
brought with him is a winning
attitude. In talking with both
players and coaches, there is
an unmistakable optimism
toward the upcoming season,
and the practices have shown
the players’ aggressiveness.

The early part of the
schedule may well present the
greatest challenges to the
Wildcats,

t ‘opponents i in the first ~
four games.

According to Farrell, in the
first couple of games we may
not be particularly artistic,
because this takes time, but I
can promise we'll be ex-
tremely emotional.”
