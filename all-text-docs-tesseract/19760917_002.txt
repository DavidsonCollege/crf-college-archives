Martin renovation delayed

By LYMAN COLLINS
Asst. News Editor

Because of a lack of funds
Martin Science Building must
wait at least another year for
its proposed renovation.

“We haye completed all the
preliminaries for the building
and we’re ready to work,”’
commented Director of the
Physical Plant Grover Meetze.
“Estimates have been made;
everything has been laid out.

“The only obstacle is fund-
, ing.” sg

The estimated cost of the
renovation is around $800,000;
however, those figures are
almost a year old. ‘‘With the
toll of inflation, the total cost
is probably closer to $1 mill-
ion,” he said.

‘From the standpoint of
physical plant, the renovation
is the top priority in capital
improvements to the college,”’
Meetze added.
~ Acting Vice President for
Development Julius W. Mel-
ton said that his office was
continuing the work of prev-
ious vice president Craven
Williams toward funding the
renovation.

_“T assume that the new vice
psident will make every
rt to get the project under

a this coming summer,’’ he

He explained that the col-
lege was hoping to obtain a
grant from a private founda-
tion to fund the majority of
the costs.

“It would be premature to

say how things are going at
this time,’” Melton explained. '
“Things are in the works and

we are following the appro- :

priate channels. We are hope-
ful of success.”

Chairman of the chemistry —

department J. Nicholas Burn-
ett reiterated Melton’s com-
ments on funding, but was
somewhat more cautious con-

cerning the earliest possible |

date for completion.
“Certainly the earliest date
for beginning the work is this
summer but we have no indi-
cations that the funding will
come through that quickly,”
commented Burnett. ‘“‘But of
course it could come through
any day, we just don’t know.”’
* He explained that it would
probably take about six
months to complete the pro-
ject. He said that he hoped
they could begin in the middle
of a spring term and then be
finished by the middle of the
following fall term. In spacing
the work in that fashion it
would be possible to interrupt
a minimum of lab-work.
“We think that renovation
of this building will be much

more economical than building

a'new one,” he added.
Burnett said that a new

facility would cost somewhere

‘around two to three million

dollars compared with the
million dollar estimated cost of
the renovation.

“After renovation this buil-
ding will not be perfect,’’ he
continued, “‘but on the other
hand if you sat down with
pencil and paper and started
from scratch the resulting
building would still have its
flaws.

“Being in this building forty
years has given us a certain
advantage because we know
how things will work from
experience.’’

The present building has
about 20,000 square feet of
usable floor space. The reno-
vation would add several
thousand more because the
attic of the present building
will be better utilized in addi-
tion to a new storage building
that will be constructed to the
rear of the building during the
renovation.

The plans call for better use
of lobby space and all related
labs will be located on the
same floor. This will allow
some labs to share expensive
equipment. The entire buil-
ding will be centrally air-con-
ditioned and rewired.

ARA revives ’72 system, seeks profit upturn

By CHARLES ERWIN
Staff Writer

The new meal ticket plan
instituted by the College food
service, ARA Services Incor-
porated, is not really new. In
the face of low ‘profits for the
last three years, ARA has
returned to the system it used
in 1972.

Food Service Director Ron
Scott stated that he is re-
quired to earn ‘‘a fair amount
of return’’ by the firm’s parent
company. In the last few
years, income has barely man-
aged to cover expenditures,
with profits falling to twe
percent in 1975.

Up until the spring of 1972
when dining services were
moved from the old student
union to Richards, Rusk, and
Bailey Houses, the college had
subsidized ARA at a mutually
agreed profit level.

At that time the dining
services were removed from
college control and returned to
a profit-and-loss situation.

Scott feels that the subsidy
program was “‘a nicer way to
operate but not feasible:

“The college wanted the
student to pay full board...the
student was not actually pay-
ing for the total food: service
when some of the money had
to. come from endowment or
operating funds,’’ sdid Scott.

Scott explained that the
financial troubles of last year’s
program was due largely to its
flexibility.

Students were allowed to
share their meal tickets with
friends and dates or even to
sell their tickets. No definite
hours were set for each meal,

i

a student being ahio to eat
whenever he pleased between 7
am and 7 pm.

“We went back to the basic
board plan because it will give
the students more food for
their money, even though it
will cost us less than in
previous years,’’ continued
Scott.

The revitalized basic plan
offers students 19 meals per

week at a cost down $100 from
last year. The reduction in
cost is a product of stream-
lining the whole operation.
The unproductive operating
hours from 8:30 to 11 am and 2
to 5 pm have been cut out.
Dining tickets can now only be
used by the person whose
picture appears on the oppo-
site side of the ID card.
Expensive main courses such

as steaks are no longer offered
every few nights—but only
once every two weeks.
Individual meals can no
longer be exchanged, so that if
a student declines to attend a
meal which he is eligible to eat
he loses it. Scott explained
that students actually only
pay 70 percent of the cost of
the meals listed on their cards.

WDA V turns on to stereo

By DENNIS McLAWHORN
Staff Writer |

WDAV Radio is going ster-
eo, one of two major changes
they plan for the near future.
The other big project will be
an increase in wattage from
the present ten watts to over
18,000.

The switch to stereo is
scheduled for the first week in
October and although the date
is not definite, studio manager
Jack Golden confirmed that
the change is a certainty. This
moye should improve tonal
quality tremendously.

The proposal to intensify
the power is still dependent

upon the FCC, (Federal Com-

munications Commission). If
they approve WDAV’s appli-
cation, the step-up will pro-
bably come about in the fall of
next year. The additional .wat-
tage would increase the range
from the five to ten mile radius
it currently serves to a pos-
sible eighty-mile radius.
Golden commented on the
improvements, ‘‘It’s been a
playtoy for the last four years,
and I think it’s time we lived

up to our potential.”

There will also be some
disadvantages of the modifi-
cations. The station will have
to discard some records, and
part of the audience five to ten
miles from the transmitter will
lose reception. Golden remar-
ked, “‘The poor guys down at
UNC-C will have to start
listening to their own station
instead of us.”

Golden

WDAV also plans several
additions to the programming
over the next few months.
ABC Contemporary Radio
news, SGA and NC PIRG
features, and a regular Mon-
day night progtam featuring a

collection of old radio shows
are among other innovations
on the schedule. Many of the
away sports events have been
contracted with professional
stations in the area and Dav-
idson students will continue
doing the home games.

Golden said, ‘‘DAV news
will be returning ‘with a fresh
face.’ This year, they will be
adding a new editor-of-the-day
concept: news with a point of
view.

The station also plans to
include three extra hours of
classical music per day if and
when the 18,000 watts is put
into effect. Rumor has‘it that a
soap opera is in the works for
WDAYV, too.

Golden said of the Station,
‘“We're here as a service to the
students, not only in the area
of entertainment, but in infor-
mation as well. And this year,
more than ever, we will be
concentrating on providing in-
formation to the students.

“T'd like to encourage every
organization on campus to use

us to get their message across
to the students.”

figures from past years which
show that the average student
does not attend 30 percent of
his meals.

He noted that a student
taking more than 70 percent of
their meals are ‘‘getting a heck
of a bargain.”

Dining club tickets now list
all of ‘the meals to which a
student is entitled on a parti-
cular day.

Each meal is marked off on
the card when the student
presents himself at the dining
houses or the snack bar.

ARA has been operating
two weeks this year and Scott
had been unabie to determine
if the changes will straighten
out his financial problems.

He noted that students
always attend more meals at
the beginning .of the year
because the program is new,
but after awhile attendance
drops.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. included a refer-
ence to food service improve-
ments in his call for a $35
million fund raising goal.

Business Manager Currie
stated that he does not believe
these funds will go towards a
central dining facility.

In a written statement Cur-
rie said that the traditional
small group dining system will
be for at least the next ten
years and perhaps longer.

“We do have certain needs
to carry out for the present.
houses. Mere production space
and additional seating are
needed. Also, dry storage
space and more refrigerator

and freezer capacity are nece-
ssary.
