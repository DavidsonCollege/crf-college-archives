patted, bodies hugged. And,
amazingly, this same David-
son of scorn in only four
months time has metamor-
phosed into a better place.

Memories are good now.
Friends recount them and
build upon them.
Exaggeration is as free as the
wine and laughter.

And the immortal freshman
(who nightmared a roommate
dressed sweetly in pink, a
group of brilliance for
hallmates, a hall counselor
made of stone and lead) has
learned that merely we
humans dwell here. No more.
No less.

Things are too good now in
the early moments to recall
the ‘‘unfortunate’’ incidents of
the so very recent past. I
would be more of an ogre than
Iam if I choose to spew and
complain so soon in my colum-
nizing. So I too start op-
timistically.

Coeducation is becoming
noticeable. There dre no
longer only a few blooms in a
field of weeds. Perhaps the
college will call itself
coeducational now rather than
still proclaim itself all male
with a recent. decision to add
women.

The addition to Belk is more
than livable. It’s enjoyable.

Only one (maybe two) elm
trees had to be removed

Tumors have been removed

The new library is grand—
perhaps grand enough to have
cost students a college union

encouraging to know that in a
few months the construction
workers will finally , cease
their racket.

I feel like Pollyanna.

Maybe everyone of David-
son’s “‘Family’’ feels for just
an instant, for just a passing
moment,. that Davidson
College is as-close to per-

Good To Be\Back

Pardoning Nixon Mocks Law

“Religion and politics don’t
mix.”’

In. the light of recent
manipulations on the scene of
our nation’s capital, this idea
provokes some thought. As a
minister’s son, it has caused
me to wonder foo. Maybe even
more than most people.

But why?

Nixon has taken us, the
American people, for fools for
a long time. Anyone who had
all those incriminating tapes

and did not get rid of them
surely thought we were either
too apathetic to be concerned
or too stupid to realize the im-
plications they substantiated.
In either case, he was wrong.

He used the CIA and the FBI
to cover up crimes.

He lied to the American
people, which is certainly
nothing to take lightly.

He headed a ring: of men
who broke laws, falsified
stories, bribed people (call it

Nature’s Tender Song Rivals
Lure of Electronic Wizardry

The same friend who let-
tered (with clandestine aban-
don, no doubt)
MAZAFRAZAS! across a
sheet in the then-middle of my
writing pad on a ‘summer
evening only to have it just
discovered by me was once
the subject of a bet.

A bet with another friend as
we speculated how he was get-
ting settled in his new summer
habitat.

The issue was the probable
order in which he unpacked
his car.

My money was on that thing
that rhymes with the second
half of what a doorbell sounds
like when the Avon lady rings
it.

My friend suggested that it
would be his stereo. Music.
Entertainment for ears. The
focus of my entrance.

I’m not sure who won the
bet, or even whether .we
bothered to raise the question
later, but I.am sure that in
either case music flowed.’

Like so many I know my
friend is engaged in the task of
orchestrating his days. We
search for tunes to hum in the
morning sun, for rhythms to
bounce us through’the day’s
work, for melodies to soothe
the evening hours.

Take a look around the
dorms and notice the abun-
dance of steréos. Music is big
business.

Summer’s-stock of new
albums is one more way of
sliding back into school and
sharing separate memories.
Idle hours bubble away before
the masters of electronic
overkill.

Let me be the first to admit
(never one to moralize) my
addiction to plastic platters.
Try a summer without your
stereo and see how many
albums you can sing by heart.

Prone to attacks of con-
science in the early morning
hours, I have at times ad-
mitted knowing more Beatle
lyrics than Shakespeare.

T have begun to worry about

my ears, though. Mamma
taught you about Q-Tips, but
why keep thém clean if you
don’t use them?

The mad Mazafrazas villain
also spends a lot of time
talking about “hearing.” He
keeps his ears open even when
thay’re not bent back before
speakers.

Escape loudspeaker mania
now and then and check out
the music of Davidson
blooming. Crowds of people
hum with unrecorded magic.

Crazy birds mimic study
habits and sing all night. Some
even swear by the symphonies
a mind produces in a hushed
library.

Outside the house the
crickets are celebrating a
summer gone in name only.
Soon yells will ring and the
train will pass with the music
of travel and bigger webs that
weave around Davidson. The
porch shakes.

To quote a current hack
science fiction writer :

Listen:

hush-money if you like),
the list goes on.

And the rationale behind all
this was simply to get Richard
Nixon re-elected.

Now he is pardoned.

I contend that Ford’s pardon
of Nixon is unconstitutional.
By definition, a pardon is a
remission of a penalty. (Check
your local dictionary.)
Naturally you cannot have a

‘penalty until you have a guilty

verdict.

This would lead me _ to
believe that Ford is admitting
Nixon’s guilt. It is funny,
though, that there has never
been an admission of guilt
from Nixon. But I am getting
ahead of myself.

Ford has granted Nixon im-
munity from prosecution, in
essence; that is amnesty.

But, I thought. we heard
someone else was going to get
amnesty. I guess Ford must
have changed his mind. Or
perhaps the decision has just
been delayed. But I hope not
too many of the boys in
Canada believe this, because
they could be wrong.

But the real heartbreaks of
this decision fall in two areas.

We have seen a double-
standard set with regard to
justice. The President is
really above the law. He can
allegedly commit a crime and
not have to stand trial for it.
That is really bad news. I hope
Lincoln, Jefferson,
Washington, and the rest did
not hear about it. it would
have probably shattered
them.

President Ford’s decision
makes a mockery of ‘‘equal
justice under the law.”’

What do we tell those in

prison? What do we tell those

facing charges related to the
Watergatemess? Can we sim-
ply tell them justice will not be

-served.in America?

With the ascension of Ford -
‘to the. Pr

Presidency, . we had.

hopes of a new respect for the
law. The presidential pardon
has shattered these hopes.

It was really upsetting to
hear Ford say that he had -
recived spiritual guidance in
relation to his decision. I

‘believe that Ford has, in fact,

denied the higher law which
was engraved in our country’s
moral code by the os
fathers.

When 2 aman goes to oy
takes communion, shakes
hands with some religious of-
ficials; pardons Nixon, and
then heads for the golf course,
the whole process sages to
look fishy.

Then we find out that Ford’s
lawyers or assistants had been
conferring with Nixon’s aides
prior to the Sunday forgiving
ceremonies. That seems to
support the view of one
congressman who said \that
Ford could not make his own
decisions. And it looks like it is
no divine power that is helping
him make them.

And so, /in the midst! of all
the “religion” that seems to
have engulfed the White
House, there is forgiveness for
a man who has yet to admit his
sins, but ill will for those (and
there were surely a few) who
put a higher moral doctrine
(*Thou shall not kill’?) above
their military orders to kill,

The inconsistencies are
staggering.

My late-night arguments for
religion are certain to take a

jolt. (They were in enough hot
‘water as it was.)

Thanks Jerry, I needed that.

“Religion and politics don’t
mix.”

Maybe so.

But perhaps it simply
depends on who is doing the
mixing.

I hope so.
