THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1964

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

With Mixed Emotions

Disregarding for a moment the new
faculty oath itself. we want to express
a note of appreciation to the trustees,
in particular the Education Commit-
tee.

For several months now, a number
of trustees have put in a tremendous
amount of time and effort in studying
and restudying the question of the
faculty oath.

The answer they came up with may
or may not ultimately prove to be in
the best interests of Davidson College.
but that answer must be recognized
as a sincere and honest effort on the
part of the trustees to best serve
those interests.

te

At the risk of being presumptuous,
we intend to reserve detailed editorial
‘comment on the potential repercus-
sions of the new oath until we have
had a chance to give the matter more
thorough consideration.

We still oppose the idea of a re-
quired faculty oath. However. if a
verbal test of faculty loyalties must
exist, the trustees have definitely tak-
en a positive step toward making the
test more acceptable to prospective
professors. The.revamped oath repre-
sents more of a statement of dedica-
tion, whereas the old one was, as Dr.
Warner Hall termed it this week, a
“theological witch hunt.”

Christmas In March

The Easter Gift Fund is off to a
good start. More than 500 votes were
cast in Tuesday’s election. If this turn-
out is any indication of the interest
of the student body in the Fund, the
stated goal of 2.300 dollars should be
‘met and exceeded.

The Nevin’s Vocational School is a
worthy recipient of this year’s Fund.
Many of the people with whom it
works can be included in the 20 per
cent of Americans whom President
Johnson recently classed as poverty-
stricken.

But beyond the mere fact of re-
stricted income is the fact that many
of these people of low intelligence
feel a deep sense of shame because of
their condition. Unfortunately, the
attitude still persists in many quarters
that there is something morally wrong
with mental defectives. It is hardly
surprising, therefore, that a signifi-
cant number of people of low intelli-
gence develop other types of mental
illness. One cannot live day after day
with the belief that there is something
“bad” about him, and retain mental
and emotional stability.

In a modern, complex society we
often tend to measure the worth of a
man in terms of the amount or kind
of work he does. The distinction be-
tween “white-collar” and ‘blue-collar’
workers, for example. carries with it
certain connotations of social prestige,
intelligence, background, and so on.
And the man who does no work, re-
gardless of whether this results from a
lack of motivation or a lack of ability,
is usually regarded as a sort of para-
Site on society. Small wonder, then,

A Breath Of Fresh

After all the years of ineffective
complaints about the Slater outfit's
operation in the Student Union, at
long last a day of reckoning is appar-
ently at hand.

It is encouraging to see a public
official—in this case Mr. Noah Wal-
ters, a sanitation inspector for the
state Board Of Health—with a real
sense of devotion to his duties. ‘

In our last editorial on the oath we
pointed out (as had the faculty com-
mittee which studied the oath) the in-
consistency in allowing a man to teach
here for an indefinite period of time
without taking the oath, but requiring
it of candidates for full professorship.

The trustees definitely solved the
ineonsistency, but what they came up
with wasn’t exactly what we had in
mind. The oath will now be required
of all professors wishing to establish
tenure. Thus the new oath is definite-
lv a compromise—a less objectionable
oath. but. wider application.

Finally. if the oath must be. we
greatly applaud the trustee action in
taking it out of the commencement
ceremonies and putting it into a quiet
religious service. The new context will
be far more conducive to a professor’s
making a genuinely-felt. statement of
dedication to religious ideals and vo-
cation.

We were mildly astounded and ex-
tremely gratified to learn of the un-
animous trustee vote of confidence
given the administration concerning
controversial speakers. To say the
least, we hope the action represents a
trend in trustee attitude towatd aca-
demic freedom in general.

that the mental defective often feels
ashamed that he is as he is.

It is precisely at this juncture that
the work of the Nevin's Vocational
School takes on such importance. By
training people of low intelligence to
perform some kind of simple skill,
the school makes a positive contribu-
tion to the mental and emotional, as
well as financial, well-being of these
people. It enables them to become use-
ful and productive members of the
society in which they live. No doubt
the great majoritv of Nevin’s grad-
uates will never become expert crafts-
men or technicians. But in a life which
is full of the darkness of despair and
guilt, whether real or imagined, even
one small candle of hope represents
a tremendous amount of light.

This is where we come in. Because
of its limited sources of income,
Nevin’s has been unable to expand as
Charlotte has grown. The 14,000
dollars it receives annually from serv-
ice clubs is devoted entirely to the
upkeep and operation of. existing
facilities. The 2.300 dollar Gift Fund
will cover, in. full, the expenses of
building and equipping the new work-
shoo which the school must have in
order to meet the increasing needs of
the Charlotte area.

So often we are aware of people
around us who need our help, but we
don’t know how to go about helping
them. This year’s Gift Fund is a
vehicle through which we can help a
great many people fashion useful and
constructive lives for themselves.
Keep that in mind when the solicitor
on your hall knocks on your door.

Air

Mr. Walters will no doubt come un-
der criticism from certain quarters
for his honest and straightforward en-
forcement of state sanitation and
health regulations, but we are certain
that this man, who has the best in-
terests of the public at heart, will car-
ry out his duties with unswerving
dedication.

ADOPTED BY TRUSTEES

Statement Of Purpose

Ed. Note: The following
statement of purpose was
adopted by the Trustees of
Davidson College Wednesday,
Feb. 19.

1. Christian Commitment:

Davidson College is an insti-
tution of higher learning estab-
lished by the Presbyterians of
North Carolina in 1837. Since its
founding the ties which bind the
college to the Presbyterian
Church have remained close and
strong. It is the desire of all
concerned that this vital rela-
tionship be continued in the fu-
ture, to the mutual advantage
of church and school. The prim-
ary loyalty of the college extends
beyond the bounds of denomina-
tion to the Christian Community
as a whole, through which med-
ium it would seek to serve the
world.

Davidson recognizes God as
the source of all truth. As a
college committed to the his-
toric Christian faith, it sees
Jesus Christ as the central
fact of history, giving purpose.
order, and vatue to the whole
of fife. Davidson is dedicated
fo the quest for truth and
would set no limits to the ad-
ventures of the mind. Hence.
it encourages teachers and.
students to explore the facts of
the universe through the fret
and rigorous use of their in-
ftellectual powers. Faith and
reason must work toaether in
mutual respect if Davidson Is
to realize her vision of ex-
cellence in the field of Chris-
tian higher education.

tl. The College: A Commun-
ity of Learning

In implementing its purpose
to promote higher learning, Dav-
idson has chosen to be a college.
to maintain itself as a small
community of learners, to em-
phasize the teaching responsibili-
ty of all professors, and to en-
sure the opportunity for personal
relationships between students
and teachers. It is vital that all
students, freshmen as well as
upperclassmen, know and study
under mature and scholarly men
who are able and eager to pro-
vide for each of them stimulus,
instruction and guidance.

In meeting its responsibilities,
the college must constantly en-
deavor to provide adequate phy-
sical facilities, and to increase
its financial resources; but more
important, it must seek men of
the highest caliber for student
body and faculty alike. The
selection of students must be
based upon merit rather than
upon economic status, social
standing, or ethnic background.
Davidson must always seek men
of character, of general as well

B.C.

as academic ability. of loyalty
to the ideals of the college, and
of promise for future usefulness.
In the selection of teachers, it
must seek men of genuine spirit-
uality who are outstanding intel-
lectually, who have the best
training available in their fields
of study, and whose interest in
the students and in teaching is
unfeigned and profound, It must
also provide these men with the
time and opportunity for crea-
tive scholarship which is funda-
mental to the best teaching.

itl. Education in the Liberal
Arts

Davidson is a college of liberal
arts. As such it emphasizes those
studies, disciplines and activities
which liberate men physically,
mentally and spiritually. Al-
though its curriculum prepares
men adequately for graduate
study. Davidson's primary pur-
pose is to develop men of hu-
and creative minds and of Chris-
tian character for full lives of
leadership. of service, and of
self-fulfillment. The college re-
quires physical education, pro-
vides for competitive athletics,
and encourages varied social
and cultural activities. It en-
deavors to teach students to
think clearly and accurately, to
make relevant and valid judg-
ments, to discriminate among
values. and to cormmunicate
freely with others in the realm
of ideas. Since this can be sig-
nificantly realized only on the
basis of an appreciative know-
ledge of the past and a working
acquaintanceship with current
theory, Davidson concentrates
upon the study of history, litera-
ture, music and the arts, the
physical, natural and social
sciences, languages. mathema-
tics, philosophy and religion.

Just as body and mind re-
quires exercise and nourish-
ment for healthy growth, so
does the spirit. Davidson main-
tains, therefore, that a col-
lege must be a worshipping
as welt as a studying com-
munity, \f it is to nurture the
whole man and ff it is to be
genuinely Christian. Hence,
religious services and activi-
tles, as well as courses in re-
liglon, form an integral part of
its program.

Davidson College possesses a

priceless heritage bequeathed by
those who have given their lives
and their possessions for its wel-
fare. To it has been much, and
of it much will be required. In
gratitude for what has been ac-
complished, but in humble rec-
ognition that it has. not fully
measured up to its own ideals
either in learning or in life, its
trustees, its faculty, its students.
and its friends must constantly
rededicate themselves to their
task. Only through ceaseless ef-
fort and sacrificial labor can
they make of Davidson what it
seeks to be—A Christian liberal
arts college second to none in
the service of God and of man.

_LETTERS TO

Edwards

THE EDITOR

Defends

Atheist’s Challenge

Dear Editor:

It seems to me that a good
many people are prone to make
rather scathing observations on
topics which are completely out
of their range of experience.
Unon réading. that their beloyed
Christian Davidson College had
actually asked an atheist to
corrupt the young and feeble
minds of its uninformed and im-
mature students with his blas-
phemous doubletalk. scores of
loyal Christians immediately
penned angry letters to the var-
ious news media of the area. My
knowledge of Christianity is
rather limited. since I myself
am one of these puerile students,
yet I seem to recall that Chris-
tianity is a faith which has with-
Stood the ravages of immorality
and athéism in various forms
for almost 20 centuries.

If a young Christian can pro-

vide no answers to the chal-

lenges of today, he is a poor
supporter of his cause. Dr.

MacCormac supplied many of
these answers, and aroused

concern toward filling In the

missing plates in the defensive
armour of theism.

I don't propose to defend Dr.
Scriven, But I most definitely de-
fend his right to speak. For Rev.
Long, who calls Scriven an
“amateur popinjay,"' I will be
willing to furnish both the coffee
and the cups he requests in
order to hear his final blows to
Scriven in such a short length
of time. Maybe this could be
arranged: surely our immature
campus can listen to a minister
of the gospel defending his own
faith.

Charles A. Edwards

Watson

Dear Editor:

If there were more men like
Dr. Scriven, the arrogance and
intellectual dishonesty of those
who profess to know all religious
truth would happily disappear.
Hearing this brilliant gentleman
was one of those rare ‘moments
that make living in a community
dominated by. status seekers,

Rotarians, and the religiously
orthodox tolerable.

I should like to express my
thanks to the Davidson YMCA
for inviting this outstanding
scholar to your campus, and
allowing us ‘outsiders’ the op
portunity to hear him.

Wiseman

Dear Editor:

Surely I am joined. by the
many other level-headed and
clear.thinking realists who make
up this college. in my shock at
being confronted by such ideal-
istic phantasy as was unleashed
‘in the student sermon at the last
Vesners service.

After the initial wave of in-
dignation passes away, | won-
der how an intelligent person,
after several years under the
sophisticated apron of Mother
Davidson, can dare express
such unrealistic ideas. Surely
Mr. Reese must realize that
we must needs take arms
against our seas of troubles
with more respectable hypoth-
eses than the outgrown, child-
comforting thoughts which
were set forth.

With such omnipotent phrases
in current acceptance and use
by religious scholars as ‘‘ulti-
mate concern’ or ‘“‘ground of
our being,”’ it is most difficult
to understand why anyone dare
employ such evangelical anarch-
isms as “love” or ‘‘Jesus."’ Also,
he must take us for complete
dupes to suggest such an out-
rageous maxim as “‘be honest
with yourself,’ let alone ‘“‘be
honest with others’’ (advice
which destroys the seven pillars
of our foreign policy).. Apart
from the excessive and unwar-
ranted use of the words "‘Jesus”’
and ‘God, perhaps the most
disturbing aspect of the entire
spasm of faith was the feeling
that. he probably meant every
old-fashioned word he said. Per-
haps the Chaplain could call.

Myers: ‘The Visit’JTops
Previous Vag Efforts

BY PETE MYERS
Davidsonian Drama Critic

Opening nights at plays are very exciting indeed, and last night was no excep-
tion. Friedrich Duerrenmatt’s “The Visit” was produced with a finesse that has never
been seen on this campus. The play, written for a cast of at least 35, in three acts and
nearly’ twenty scenes, is an ambitious project even for a professional group. One is
often left wondering whether the Drama Department has been overambitious.

The story concerns the visit
of the richest woman in the
world to her childhood home,
Gullen, Europe. Her visit to this
broken, poor town causes quite
a stir, especially when she pro-
poses to give the town one bil-
lion marks in return for justice,
with which she is obsessed,

Louise Hampton plays Claire
Zachanassian, the richest
woman in the world; her child-
hood sweetheart, Anton Schill,
is played by Professor James
Gross. Both do exceptionally
well in these most demanding
roles. Both evidently have put
much time and great effort
into their parts, but still some-
thing is lacking.

Mrs, Hampton is nearly pro-
fessional, but her opposite, Mr.
Gross, cannot quite reach the
same heights except in isolated
scenes. Mrs. Hampton misses

ARBUCKLE ULTIMATUM:

There are newsstands in the dorms and the
Union. They hold newspapers — The Charlotte
News. Everybody likes to read; many do not like to
pay. Everybody will pay (in one way or another).

Thank you,
Happy Hangman

the extreme vitality so necessary
for her part. The character must
be projected before she even
speaks a line. Mr. Gross is
missing depth and technique,
often resulting in monotony and
loss of character, but doing an
excellent job is some of the
most difficult scenes. One feels
that stronger direction is need-
ed to bring out the best that is
apparent in both these people.

The supporting roles: the
Burgomaster (Will Terry);
Bobby, the butler (Michael
Frye) and the Teacher Muller
(John Hall) are on the whole
good, but. again something is
missing. The butler looks the
part, but does not sound it at
all, which completely destroys
the good characterization that
comes through when-he is not
giving a long speech.

John Hall. the Teacher, has
an excellent role, but he ob-
viously needs more experience
to get the best out of it, for he at
times becomes too hysterical.
In the more “comic” first act,
the Burgomaster does very well,
but the comic overtones and the
exaggerated emotionalism are at
times too much, in the third act
especially.

The bit parts, the townspeople
and entourage, are too numerous
to mention and criticize separ-
ately, but on the whole, the

group scenes run smoothly and
very effectively and created a
lasting impression. One was al-
ways aware of what seemed to
be unrealized potential.

Technically, the ptay is ef
fective, for the most part.
First to be mentioned here
should be the superior per-
formance of the girls’ chorus
and the brass band. Both did
a commendable job. At the be-
ginning, though, one thinks
that the introduction will never
end so that the curtain can
open.

The lights and the sound ef-
fects needed much more prac-
tice. Per se they were all right,
but the presentation was rough.
and many gross errors were
made, in that cues were missed
and technical mistakes were
readily apparent.

The colorful sets, designed
by Preston Faggart, Andy
Sale and Mrs. Richard Trudell,
were pseudo-avant garde, in-
sofar as they were of the in-
dividual unit type. Due to the
limitations in the size of Hod-
son Hall, the stage appeared
cluttered and overcrowded.
This fautt could conceivably
have been overcome by vary-
ing vertical heights to give the
ttlusion of depth. Needless to
say, the movements of the
characters were severely re-
stricted.

The Drama Department's pro-
duction of ‘The Visit’ is one of
the best play productions ever
to be seen, at least in the last
two years at Davidson. It is an
adventuresome undertaking, but
one senses a lack of cohesion,
and one is often given the feel-
ing that the production just
misses the boat. Perhaps this
is due to a lack of assertive di-
rection. That it is well worth
seeing is still beyond question.
