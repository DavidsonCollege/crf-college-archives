Nick's Flicks

With the absence of any Pop Films this weekend on account of
the free beer and circuses of Spring Frolics, the pining cinephile
must wait until Wednesday the fifteenth for Fine Films’
showing of In the Heat of the Night. Starring Sidney Poitier and
Rod Steiger and dating from the days when director Norman
Jewison still pretended to have a social conscience, this powerful
law-and-order drama manages.to do considerably more than

the racial tensions underlying the relationship of

a white policeman to a black
citizen, which is the feature’s
point of departure and which
gained it considerable acclaim
in the sixties, As the drama
progresses, the exploration of

the two men’s personalities and |

backgrounds leaves far behind

the question of skin-colour to produce an encounter of quite

genuine human power which these days has to be regarded as .

' the film’s saving grace. Relentless stuff, it is worth the effort
required. to.see it and contains two fine performances by the
protagonists. In Love at 8 p.m.

On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday the Visulite is showing a
double bill of films by the much-feted German director
Rainer-Werner Fassbinder. From my experience of his films so
far I’m afraid I tend to regard Herr Fassbinder as one of the
most tedious individuals ever to brandish a camera at an actor,
and his films sadly reflect the personality of their maker.
However, The Marriage of Maria Braun is said by afficionados
to be one of his very best, so I shall be going along, hoping to

have my prejudices dispelled. The story of a woman’s struggle
to make something of her life during the post-war economic

| boom, the film apparently deals incisively with the aftermath of
Nazism and the embrace of rampant materialism.

Also on Tuesday, another class film, Lon Day’s Journey Into
Night is being shown in Love at 7:30 p.m. Apparently it is a
very fine version of O’Neill’s unremittingly bleak view of the
human condition and I can do little more than recommend it on
hearsay evidence. This alone, however, suggests that it should
appeal to a slightly wider audience than those whose GPAs
depend upon seeing it. Go along anyway, these things are free.

New stable boasts 14 horses

By SARA WHEELER
Staff Correspondent

If you’re like most people,
one scary experience on horse-
back or maybe just one look at
the half-ton creatures made you
opt for the safety of your own
two feet. Riding horses, you
might argue, is expensive, time
consuming and dangerous. Be-
sides, the only people who ride
have been riding for years, so
why start now?

Kathleen Emmert, general
manager of the new college
stables at the lake campus, is
trying to correct misconcep-
tions like these. For $48 a term,
Emmert and her team of in-
structors will teach you to
ride.

I spent last Saturday at the
stables talking to Emmert and
enjoying the scenery and at-
mosphere. I was greeted at the
gate by Emmert’s two large and
very friendly dogs: a young
German Shepherd named
Boomer and a Newfoundland
called, very appropriately,
Bear. The stables look new and
stark but nevertheless inviting,
surrounded by the green of the
woods and pastures and the
gray-blue of the lake.

As I walked through the
tackroom, (horse cant for bridle
room) I noticed the well-worn
leather of the bridles and sad-
dles and the delightful smell of
hay and warm spring air.
Peering at me from their stalls
were some of the graceful
creatures that inspire love—or
fear—in humankind.

Most of the equipment and 12
of the 14 horses, I learned, were
donated by various people. The
other two horses belong to
students. I asked about the
horses and was immediately
deluged with information and
prejudices. Warlock, I learned,
had been sold three weeks ago
and no one seemed to bemoan
his loss. Apparently he had a
rather fiery temperament: ‘He
thought he was a stallion,”’ one
girl noted, even though he was a
gelding ( a castrated male).
Warlock dictated ‘‘who could.
eat with who and got his choice
of the mares.”’ Horse society is
apparently not very democratic.
Baron is now the top horse,
with Tar as his preferred con-
sort. Ralph ranked as a general
favorite, although Sportman, a
little pony who lives in the
pasture, is apparently the offi-
cial mascot. I was fascinated by
the horses’ names, which in-
clude Magic, Honey, Nirvana,
Flicka, and Smokey.

Before.I talked to Emmert, I

. already knew of the enthusiasm

and dedication that veteran
riders have for their sport. My

. questions, however, concerned
_ the novice, who is interested —
but: afraid to get involved.

rolled this spring. Twenty-five

dents.’
F ‘Bmmert: stressed that the .
program could accomodate stu-

dents at all levels of proficiency.

There are courses at the ‘‘Be-
ginner,’’ ‘‘Advanced Beginner,”’
‘‘Intermediate,’’ and ‘‘Ad-
vanced’’ levels.

Soon each rider in the pro-
gram will be given a rating
which will govern his use of the
stables. A ‘‘C’’ rating, which a
novice could receive after 10
weeks, will allow him to ride at
a walk or trot in the ring when
the stables are open, provided
there is at least one‘other person
there. A ‘‘B’’ rating, obtainable
within a year, will allow the

manure was to be added to
various other pleasant sub-
stances and thrown on ‘‘some-
body’s house.”’ Since this inci-
dent strangely coincided with
the weekend of pledge games, I
decided that it resulted from
something other than the love
of equestrian studies, and I

dropped the subject.

However, Emmert told me
that guys do tend to be hesitant
about riding. She attributed
this to fear of the embarrassing
stage -of ‘‘klutziness’’ which

rider to use the surrounding
trails without supervision. An
“A” rider can teach, go to fox
hunts and can even lease a horse
on a long-term basis. Emmert
estimated that it would take
about two years for a beginner
to become an instructor if he
rode once a week.

To reduce the cost of lessons,
beginners can clean the stables,
clear trails, build jumps or
paint, while more experienced
riders can teach other students.

Dangers in riding, Emmert
told me, are ‘‘very real.’”” Riders
occasionally do fall off the horse
or get stepped on. These ex-
periences, however, are usually
more frightening than physical-
ly injurious, and almost always
result from a careless mistake
on the part of the rider. Atti-
tude is therefore important.
Emmert said she would rather
teach complete novices who are
fearful but willing to ask ‘‘mil-

lions of questions” then dare-_

devils who think they know
everything.

I asked one rider why there
were so few males among the
students in the program. She
said five guys did appear once,
but only to collect manure. The

every beginner must go
through. Davidson men, she
added, make wonderful pro-
gress after they catch on and
can learn as fast as she can talk.

This spring the’stables will
host a Gymkhana. This is an
informal horse show featuring
events like an obstacle course in
which two riders— generally no-
vices—alternately lead and ride
a horse. The event will give
interested students a feel for the
sport and a chance to sign up
for fall lessons. There will also
be a professional show at the
stables the same day, so the
students may glimpse what real
riding is like.

Lessons are taught. by quali-
fied Davidson students, includ-
ing Sallie Summey, Rosie
Whitesides, Betty Eborn, Ann
Williams, and Lyn Bolen.

Bolen and Williams are hop-
ing to form a riding club. The

... Glub, would travel to,.intercolle-

giate horse shows, which have
events in everything from trott-
ing to jumps.

Davidson’s riding program
has great potential, according
to the riders. All it needs is
more students.
