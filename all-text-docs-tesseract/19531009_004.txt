SUNDAY VISITING Month Remains...

OLD TRADITION HERE

By GILBERT GRAGG

This year's freshman class has
heard a lot about some of David-
son's traditions, and one of these
is the custom of students’ visiting
in the faculty homes on Sunday.
evenings after Vespers. Almost all
upperclassmen have taken advan-
tage of this opportunity at one
time or another.

The chief reason for visiting on
Sunday evening in the professor's
homes is not so much for higher
grade, good refreshments, or the
like but the excellent opportunity
it affords the students to get to
know ‘their teachers and their
wives better and to enjoy the fel-
lowship of their home.

In order to let the students
know the address of the various
homes they wish to visit there is
a map with a Faculty and Admin-
istration Directory in the lobby of
Chambers which gives the desired
information; a duplicate copy of
this map will soon be put up in
the College Union and maybe even
in the lobby of the church.

Since many students have ex-
pressed the desire for a complete
list of when certain faculty mem-
bers would hold open house, the
following list is given for all four
Sundays during the month in order
that. students might plan whom
they wish to visit ahead of time.

This list is subject to change
since from time to time during
the year for one reason or another
some faculty member may not be
able to be at home on the evening
given, but this will always be an-
nounced at Vespers. On this com-
ing Sunday Professors Brown, E.E.,
Purcell and Peak will not have
open house as listed but will in
November.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

WILLIAMS OFFERS
TIMELY SOLUTION
TO AWKWARD TIMES

Seript ‘n Pranks, Davidson's
noted literary and humor maga-
zine, will be delivered Homecom-.
ing eve.

Second only to Charlie Spivak’s
trumpet and Southern womanhood
as a festivity attraction, the popu-
lar Scripts ‘n Pranks will enhance
the enjoyment of both, said Editor
Alden Williams in making the an-
nouncement, .

“Scripts ‘n Pranks finally of-
fers,” Williams stated, “the answer
to ‘those awkward times’ when
you're alone with her. Who hasn't
known the frustration of hunting
a conversation piece rique enough
to be inviting, yet subtle enough
to save face?”

Highlighted by the famous art
work' of Don Mahy, the year’s first
issue will feature provocative,
pristine and still prurient prose
and poetry by veterans Vereen
Bell, Ronald Wilson, Mac William-
son, Fred Myers and Dubar Ogden.

“It's the student’s pocket guide
to Weekend Success,” the editor
assured. “Let her look through it
once. If she doesn't laugh,. leave
the dance early Friday night and
see if you can get someone else to
date her Saturday.

“If she starts to chuckle, then
blushes, clasps her hand to her
face and turns red all over, then
she’s good until 2:30 or 3:00 o'clock
both nights, and worth cultivating
for Midwinters.

“And if she bursts out laughing
and shows it to you,” he concluded,
“then pin her and plan to catch
up on your sleep during ROTC
drill.”

Whether she falls though, he
added in class No. 1, No. 2 or No.
3, she'll want to be sure to get
a fresh copy of the next three
issues hot off the press. To make
certain of this, he said, Davidson
students will be able during the
Homecoming weekend to sub-
scribe to Seripts ‘n Pranks for her
at a special 2-for-one, pay-at-your-
convenience rate. Further infor-
mation will be in next week's
Davidsonien.

Student Volunteers
Meet Monday Night

Davidson’s Student Volunteer
Movement for World Missions will
hold its first meeting of the year
in the Green Room of the College
Union at 8:15 Monday night.

A man who has had considera-
ble experience as a home mission-
ary will speak to the group.

SVM leaders announced that
this meeting is for all students in-
terested in evangelical Christian
work, and is in no way limited to
those who have previously partici-
pated in SVM’s activities.

Leland Voted President
Of 1953-54 Chapel Choir

Owen Leland has been elect-
ed president of the Davidson
College Chapel Choir. Other
officers for the 1953-54 season
are John Crymes, vice presi-
dent; Murray Page, secretary-
treasurer; Ed Miller, chaplain.

NOTICE

Mr. Shaw Smith, director of the
College Union, announced today
that all students interested in
work in the Union should sign
an application for a job. They
will then be contacted as vacancies
arise. .

College Dining Rules
Changed To Relieve

Congested Conditions

To relieve somewhat the con-
jestion in the cafeteria at the Col-
lege Union, and in order to give
better service to all the students
eating there, Mr. Shaw Smith has
asked the students to cooperate
with the following requests.

All students who eat in the
cafeteria who do not have a fourth
period class are urged to begin
eating at 12:15 p.m., so that they
will be through the line by 1:00
o'clock.

The Union is also making ar-
rangements to give special pref-
erence in the line to students who
have both fourth and fifth period
classes, so that they can get to
class on time. Students concerned
should contact Mr. Smith in the
office of the Union.

Conference Splits . . .
(Continued From Page Two)
school withdrew completely from
the sports field. So, we feel, the
Southern Conference today has
members who chart the middle way

for their schools.

It is obvious that four schools
will battle it out for the Southern
Conference football honors this
fall. William and Mary, West Vir-
ginia, Virginia Tech, and the Uni-
versity, we predict, will be the
pace setters. The Buff plays both
‘the Mountaineers and the Indians
this season.

Thus, the “break up” of the
Southern Conference is not a
break, it’s only a realignment of
power, a move that makes sense, a
move that should have come years

ago.

Cleland Will Speak | TWENTY FRESHMEN
Al Sunday Vespers [HAILED BEFORE COURT

By CHUCK WRIGHT

Dr. James T. Cleland of the
Duke University Divinity School,
will be the speaker in the vesper
services Sunday night at 7:30.

Dr. Cleland is a frequent speak-
er at Davidson and is one of the
most popular speakers who has
appeared here. He is ranked as
one of the most popular college
preachers in the entire country.

A Scotsman by birth, he also
received his education in Scotland.
He taught at Amherst for several
years before joining the faculty of
the Divinity School of Duke Uni-
versity. Dr. Cleland is the preacher
in the Duke chapel.

The lectern Bible in the sanct-
uary of the Davidson College Pres-
byterian Church was a gift by Dr.
Clelland. He has other ties with
Davidson, having received an hon-
orary Doctor of Divinity degree
here two years ago.

Workman To Lead
Chapel Discussion

The first of a full program of
after-vesper discussions will be
held this Sunday, October 11,

YMCA Forums chairman Ed Stuart

man will lead a discussion on a
topic of current student interest—
“The Chapel Problem.” Students
interested in attending the discus—
sion to be held immediately after
vespers in the student lounge of
the church, should sign the list
posted in the Union lobby. Cof-
fee will be served.

Twenty freshmen answered roll

superiority complex, and acting as
a member of the upper intelli-

to the freshman class.

Punishment for the othera in-
cluded being stud boys for upper-

been fully tabulated.

Thus, with a total of 310 pints
of blood, Davidson has set a high
mark for other towns and colleges
to reach for, and many congratula-
tions go to co-chairmen Cooper
and Mitchener and all who par-
ticipated for a worthwhile job well
done.

This year the town of Davidson
did its full share in cooperation
with the Y and the Red Cross.
Through public announcements
and personal canvassing, the com-
munity of Davidson far exceeded
last year’s donations.
