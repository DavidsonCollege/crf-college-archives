Football looks forward to game, another season

By STUART RAWSON

With the Wildcats coming off
of an 0-9 record in 1986, Coach
Vic Gatto looks forward to 1987
as a chance to unify his first two
recruiting classes. With eight of-
fensive starters and six defensive
starters returning, the Wildcats
will work hard to improve in their
first year of affiliation in the Colo-
nial League. Recruiting has gone
well for Coach Gatto and his staff
of nine coaches which includes
the addition of Larry Story as the
new Offensive Coordinator. Story
was formerly the Offensive COor-
dinator of the New Jersey Gener-
als where he directed Herschel
Walker. So far the Cats have
signed 30 Freshmen for 1987 and

hope to sign at least five more be-
fore the May | deadline.

Spring practice culminates
this Saturday with the annual
Spring Game at 4:30 p.m. The
Cats will battle about 35 faithful
alumni as part of Alumni
Weekend. Coach Gatto sights
Saturday’s game as “important to
the players as individuals.” Gatto
deeims spring practice as “‘a time to
win the starting job.” He hopes it
will be a chance for the players to
“go out and have a good time.”

The Cats will be without the
services of freshman quarterback
Peter Hughes on Saturday.
Hughes received a minor concus-
sion in practice last Wednesday

on strong note

By WHIT WILKS

The women’s tennis team im-
pressively concluded its inaugural
season. in the Southern Confer-
ence this past weekend at the con-
ference tournament ‘in Asheville.
The Lady Cats turned in a very
solid second place performance as
they outscored all opponents ex-
cept perennial power Furman.
- Amy McNelis(no. 1), Marion
Stone(no. 2), Virginia Hall(no.
3), Debbie Podolin(no. 4), and
Jane Price(no. 6) all earned sec-

ond place finishes in singles play .:

Alice Stubbs(no. 5) placed fifth in
her division.

Consistency was the name of
the game on the doubles side,as all
three teams placed third for the

Cats. This marks the end of the
team’s first full season under Di-

vision I status. The squad, under —

the direction of Caroline Brown,
handled the transition in
exemplary fashion, and the tour-
nament served as an effective
gauge of the team’s strength rela-
tive to other S.C. foes.

All conference opponents,
with the exception of Furman,
were handled easily by the Cats
during the season. The future is
very promising, as all seeded
players except Debbie Podolin re-
turn next year. With a little im-

provement and lots of hard work.

1987-88 could be the year the Cats
clear the final hurdle and claim the
title of champion.

Golf ends
with hopes for

next season

By BRUCE SARKISIAN
The Wildcat golf team, while
it bettered its overall score of last
~ year’s tournament, could finish no
higher than seventh in the South-
ern Conference Tournament held
- Monday and Tuesday at Raintree

Country Club in Charlotte. Team:

captain Craig Carlock attributed
the team’s poor finish to the qual-
ity of the field and the inconsis-
tency of Wildcat golfers.

The golfers played 18 holes
Monday and 36 holes Tuesday
under difficult conditions. Rain-
tree proved to be a challenging

. layout, with. only two par fours
under 400 yards. Carlock was the
team’s’ medalist, with Gates
Grainger, Sean O'Neil, Tom

Goodrum, and Tyler Long follow-
ing close behind. The University
of Tennessee-Chattanooga took
away the team title, with Western
Carolina winning in the individual

‘medalist category.

Carlock, while discouraged
about the team’s performance this
week, is optimistic about next
year’s team. The Cats will lose
only one senior, Tyler Long, with
the rest of the team made up of
sophomores and freshmen. Car-
lock also mentioned that there is a
healthy number of good golfers in

next year’s freshman class. In ad- .

dition, the mandatory practices in-
stituted this year did not show sig-
nificant results, but “will pay off
in the long run,” the captain said.

and is being monitored closely;
also Hughes is a freshman stand-
out on the Wildcat baseball team.
Gatto sees Hughes as the offen-
sive key on-fiext season’s squad.
He passed for 473 yards last sea-
son in several starting assign-

ments. Also important to the of-.

fensive unit will be the play of
Mike Gross and Robert Sickles at
wide-receiver, a position Gatto
deems to be very strong, and the
running of Brian Kelly and Aaron
Edwards, two strong runners who
saw extensive play last season.
“Coach Gatto’s biggest. con-

“cern in 1987, his third year as head

coach, will be the defensive unit.
He viewed the Wildcats inability
to stop opponents’ offensive as a

key in the Cats poor performance
last season. The coaching staff
will concentrate their interest first
and foremost on the development
of a strong defense, hurt by the
loss of team-captain Marcus
Allen. The small number of
players in spring practice allowed
the coaching staff to switch
players into different positions,
presenting them with the chance
to place players where they are
better suited, but had not received
much playing time.

The defense will be led in
1987 by Ken Nazemetz, who was
third on the team in tackles last
year with 73, and Howard Hum-
phries, who was second in 1986

with 78; Coach Gatto also added

‘that several outstanding recruits

would step in and contribute sig-
nificantly. Two in_ particular,
Ryan Roberson, a 627); 215 Ib.
outside linebacker. from Sanford,
N. C. and Tony Hubbard, a 6’3’’,
215. Ib. linebacker were both
sought after by Division | schools
including the ACC. Gatto hopes
these two can help fill the posi-
tions vacated by Marcus Allen’s
graduation and Cole Thomason’s
departure. _

Finally, Coach Gatto added,
“We will be competitive in tie
Colonial League and we’re ex-
cited about playing Princeton in
Charlotte. Overall, we have an ex-
cellent schedule.”
