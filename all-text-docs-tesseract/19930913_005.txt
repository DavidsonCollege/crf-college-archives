Junior John Dalton's dad
Joins Clinton in Capitol

Dalton continued from page 1

nated by President Carter to the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board
in 1979, After Carter’s term, the
Daltons moved to San Antonio,
Texas, where they lived until their
recent move back to Washington.

When asked what he thought
his greatest challenge would be as
Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Dalton
replied, “To ‘right size’ the Naval
Service.” In explanation he added
that “as a result of the changes in
the world with the fall of the Soviet
Union and the end of the Cold
War, the Navy must be restruc-
tured properly, just as the people
must be treated right in the pro-
cess.”

Mr. Dalton’s hopes seem to
be high as he embarks upon his
life’s most recent journey: “The
Naval Service today has better
. people than it has had before. We
now have the finest Naval Service
in our history...Today they’re bet-
ter, brighter and more highly edu-

WIRE

cated.” He commented that Presi-
dent Clinton agrees with this as-
sessment of our Navy and ex-
pressed that he is “honored and
pleased to have the opportunity to
serve in this capacity.”

Service appears to be Mr.
Dalton’s highest calling in life,
whether it be to his country, to his
church, or to his family. The hun-
dreds of devoted friends and fam-
ily who attended his swearing-in

attest to it without the slightest of .

reservations.

When asked if he had any
thoughts on this, John, Jr. an-
swered: “Dad is the most trust-
worthy and solid person I’ve ever
known. I’ve never been anything
but proud ofhim...and I know Chris
[John’s younger brother, 19] feels
the same way.” It seems pride in
one another runs in the Dalton
blood. Secretary Dalton’s final
comment speaks for itself: “...1’d
like toadd that I’m proud Johnis at
Davidson.”

Officials on alert

after bombings

CPS - Security officials have in-
creased security on campuses na-
tionwide after two bombings ear-
lier this year that wounded profes-
sors at Yale University and the
University of California at Berke-
ley.

Law enforcement officials
have linked these two bombings
with a series of violent incidents
that have occurred sporadically
since 1978 and remain unsolved,
Campus Crime reported.

The U.S. Postal Service, the
FBI, and other law enforcement
agencies offer tips on how to deal
with questionable packages. -

*Confirm that a package. has
indeed been sent fo you. “If you
can’tconfirm this, be suspicious,”
said Paul Griffo, spokesman for
the U.S. Postal Inspectors Ser-
vice. Faculty members and staff
personnel should also be careful
of poorly typed labels that contain
misspellings and envelopes
marked “personal” or “special
delivery.”

*Be wary of packages with
excess postage. “A bomber typi-
cally doesn’t want to face a postal
service windowclerk,” Griffo said,
and will add extra postage to make-
sure the package reaches its desti-
nation.

Workshop teaches
thinking skills

ANNANDALE-ON-
HUDSON, NY (CPS) - While
mostofthe country’scollege fresh-
men were still on summer break,
290 members of the incoming class
at Bard College had met room-
mates, settled into dorms, and were
steeped in an unusual three-week
workshop that plunged them into
academia before the semester of-
ficially started.

The Language and Thinking
Workshop, known as L&T, is a

series of classes designed to teach
students how to compose, read,
and interpret texts as well as how
to edit their own writing.

Bard invited professors from
universities all over the country—
artists, economists, anthropolo-
gists, mathematicians, and jour-
nalists—to teach groups ofa dozen
students about how to interpret
text and how to write.

“As a jumping off point, stu-
dents read from an anthology—
which this year included writings
by-such authors.as Sappho, Carl
Jung, W.H. Auden, Nadine
Gordimer, and experts at the
Harvard Medical School,” said
Paul Connolly, director of Bard’s
Institute for Writing and Think-
ing.

Most students don’t seem to
mind cutting their summer short
for the 12 year-old program. Said
Michelle Dunn, a Bard junior.
“L&T isacommon bond that you
share with everyone at Bard.”

Report: Rapes on the increase
RALEIGH- One out of every
eight adult women in the United
States will be a victim of rape,
according to a recent study con-
ducted by the Medical University
of South Carolina. Rape is one of
the fastest growing crimes in
North Carolina, up 4% in 1992
alone. It is also the most under-
reported ofall violent crimes, with
only 16% of victims reporting
their assaults to police.

Colleges find women, espe-
cially freshmen, in a new envi-
ronment vastly different from the
relative security of home. There
is an increased risk of rape when
living in a dormitory or an apart-
ment. Preventing rape means re-
ducing the chances of becoming a
victim. Victims of rape or assault
are urged to report it to campus
security, the police, or a rape cri-
sis center.

Davidson's efforts to build a
comprehensive merit scholarship
program have received a big boost
with a gift of $1 million from the
Duke Endowment. The commit-
ment from the Endowment is one
of the largest awards for merit
scholarships ever received by
Davidson.

.... The funds are being used to
create the James B. Duke Scholar-

ships, named for the man who
established The Duke Endow-
ment. The first James B. Duke
Scholarships, valued at $10,000
each, have been awarded to fresh-
men Laurie Greif of Lake Oswaga,

Oregon, and Rebekah Peeples of
San Antonio! Texas.

Dean of Admission and Fi-
nancial Aid Nancy Cable Wells
said that the first two recipients of
the James B. Duke Scholarship
could not be more aptly suited for
the honor.

"Davidson seeks young
women and men who are well
rounded and gifted with a wide
range of academic, athletic and

ties. Both of this year's Duke Schol-

ars more than meet those require-
ments. The college is also commit-
ted to increasing the presence of
talented students from diverse eth-
nic and socio-economic back-
grounds. With the James B. Duke

Scholarship, Davidson will attract
more outstanding students and
makeit possible forthem to choose
Davidson. The commitment form
the Duke Endowment is extraordi-
nary."

Each year two additional
scholars will be selected so that
beginning in 1996 and continuing
in perpetuity Davidson will have
eight James B. Duke Scholars on
campus.

million commitment by the En-

dowment to the Campaign for
Davidson.

Consulting firm to study campus needs

Union continued from page 1

Although Johnston Gym re-
mains a possible sight for a new
- student center, other areas of the
campus are also under consider-
ation. “We are concerned that a
new student center should be more
centered between the pathways of
the academic, social, and recre-
ational worlds of the college than
is the current union,” commented
Kelton. z
By bringing in an outside firm
to consult on the matter, Kelton
and Union Planning Committee
Chair Dr. Sally McMillen believe
that the college will gain an objec-

tive opinion on what type of facil-
ity the college needs and where it
would best be located. “We are
hoping that MPC & Associates will
give us a new perspective as to
what’s going on in other placesand
what’s best for Davidson,” added
Kelton.

Although the representatives
from MPC & Associates will only
be on campus for three days, they
will be invited to return later on in
the fall in order that a complete
report will be finished by the end of
the semester. In addition, they will
be in contact with the Union Plan-
ing Committee which spent much
of last semester doing their own

research.

“By talking tomembersof the
faculty and to students in addition
to meeting with all the fraternities
and eating houses we tried to gain
a sense of what everyone wanted
in a new union,” said McMillen.

Before there are any ground
breaking or ribbon cutting ceremo-
nies for a new student center there
are many things left to be done,
including raising the necessary
money for such a facility; yet it
appears that there is much enthusi-
asm for this project to get under
way. “We don’t want to build or
renovate until we are sure of what
we want,” added Kelton.
