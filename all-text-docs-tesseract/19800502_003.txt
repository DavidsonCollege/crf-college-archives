Town and College: a curious and changing partne

By AL CONNETTE and

Special to The Davidsonian

Davidson College was foun-
‘ded in 1837 on property donated
by the family of General Wil-
liam Lee Davidson of Revolu-
tionary War fame. The town of
Davidson grew up around the
College and was not incorpora-
ted until some 40 years later. It
was a ‘“‘one horse town,”’ and
that horse was Davidson Col-
lege.

The College and those people
associated with it have contin-

ued to dominate the other two —

communities in Davidson—the
black community and the poor
white community. Though in
recent years the economic base
of the community has widened
and diversified, the College still
has a dominant role in the
community and a great deal of
cooperation and interaction oc-
curs between the College and
the community.

Town— Gown Cooperation

According to Business Man-
ager Bob Currie, the most
notable examples of cooperation
occurred where financial resour-
ces were pooled—as in the case
of the purchase of a fire truck.
The College donates $1500 to
the town each year in lieu of
property taxes on the College
campus, which is not taxed
because it is used for educa-
tional purposes.

Other forms of cooperation
involve College-related people
serving as town officers or
advisors, committee members,

volunteers, and initiators of .

ideas. Finally the College offers
the town recreational and cul-
tural facilities, entertainment,
and educational opportunities.
Downtown Re-development
Davidson College has at-
tempted to steer the growth and
development of the community.
In the early ‘70s the town
unveiled a plan to transform the
town’s business district into a
village mall. The existing busi-
ness district would have been
significantly enlarged without
sacrificing the small town at-
mosphere. The plans weren’t
economically feasible, according
to Mayor Nancy MacCormac,
and they were never implemen-
ted, but Davidson College,
Piedmont Bank, and Commu-
nity Properties, Inc., have con-
tinued to hold and buy up land
behind Main Street in case the
project becomes possible in the
future. MacCormac said the
town is now in the pearees of
updating this plan.
' This land grab aroused some
blacks’ suspicion that the Bank
and the College were trying to
control more of the town, so this
idea has carried over. James
Raeford, Assistant President of
the Community Development
Club, said, “They (the College)
own all the land. Once they get
their hands on it, that’s it.”
There is some uncertainty in
the black community about
whether the College does own
the land and how much it owns.
Daisy Raeford, Chairman of the
Town Community Relations

Committee, said ‘‘The blacks.

think the College owns the land
but we're not sure.”

During the ‘70s, specialty
shops began to thrive on Main

‘Main Street are

~ Street, partly because of their

ability to draw customers from
surrounding areas, according to
Mayor MacCormac. These do
not really serve the lower in-
come black and Delburg Street
communities who wanted dis-
count stores such as Revco and
K-mart. Annie Mildred Lowry,
a cook at KA‘and active in the
black community, said the
“still so

whitey,’’ and James Raeiord

fits directly from such housing
development by increasing the
tax base.

In past years, the College has
opened up subdivisions and sold
the lots at subsidized rates to
faculty. These subdivisions
were gradually filled and no
areas have been developed re-
cently, though, there are plans
to develop the MacConnell farm
property on Concord Road.
However, as Jack Tate, Presi-

ASN
Sag ae ioe?

said he “‘goes uptown just to
pay a bill.”

Irene Blackwell, who has run
the Village Store for 14 years,
said she caters to student and
College business. Tom Willi-
ams, editor of the Mecklenburg
Gazette, said “It always seem-
ed to me that the College has
kept the downtown alive. It.s
been important in the atmos-
phere of the town.’’ Blackwell
agreed. ‘‘As far as I’m con-
cerned, it’s a plus. The College
attracts people in all the time.’

Several years ago the College
considered moving student post
office boxes into the Student
Union. The town government

and Main Street businessmen -

reacted by condemning the plan
because students might not
shop on Main Street if they
weren’t drawn across the street
by the Post Office.

The College owns a good bit
of land in the downtown area,
mainly the land between Rail-
road Street, Griffith Street, and
Depot Street (except for the

Copeland House). Hence, the ©

College’s support is needed for
any attempt at downtown de-
velopment. The College has in
fact given this support by
offering to move the bookstore
onto Main Street should any

‘new building occur. In addition,

the new Medical Center was
made possible by the invest-
ment of College Endowment
Funds. At one time, putting
this building behind the busi-
ness district was considered in
hopes of reviving the 1972
downtown development plan.
College Steers.Growth .
The College initiated further

~ community development by

providing subsidies or loans to
faculty and staff for construc-
ting or buying houses within
the community. The town bene-

formed. The committee used a
combination of Farmers Home
Administration Loans, free
plans provided by the North
Carolina Extension Service,
minimal charges for lots and
only non-profit agents to estab-
lish the Lakeside Housing: De-
velopment. The project was a

_tremendous success, and it

dent of Piedmont Bank and
Trust, has pointed out, this
subsidizing tended to discour-
age private investors from de-
veloping land, thus inhibiting
town development. The impact
of this is hard to judge. There

- does seem, however, to be an

interest in keeping Davidson
small and comfortable by res-
tricting the sale of land.

The College has had consider-
able say in major town decisions
on growth such as the rejection
of Marineworld or the coming of
Ingersoll- Rand. New projects
are in the making. One example
is a planned community on
Lake Norman at the end of
Griffith Street across the I-77
overpass.

The College appears .to be
lending tacit support to the
project. One possible reason for
this is that it will increase the
possibility of constructing a
motel at the I-77 interchange
which would benefit both the
College and the.town. Another
reason, suggested by Julius
Melton, Director.of Special
Resources at the College and
member of the Community Rel-
ations Committee, is that ‘‘the

would be better off—
less vulnerable to misunder-
standing within the communi-
ty— if it loses its domineering
status. ”
Three Housing Schemes

Finally, a major contribution

of the College to the develop-

ment of the community has .

been the elimination of sub-
standard housing.

The first attempt to reduce
substandard housing was 30
yéars ago when DCPC pastor
Carl Pritchett raised money
from college students and local
citizens to build 14 houses on
Mock Circle.

The second attempt began

established cooperation
betweeen various groups in the
community. It drew widespread
attention and was a model for
national legislation which made
provisions for low-income hous-
ing development assistance.
The most recent effort has
also involved many college-
related people and resulted in
the federally subsidized rental
units on the lake near General
Time Corporation.
Employment Monopoly
The College has also played
an important role in employ-

ment, especially of blacks. Until

Reeves Corporation moved into
Cornelius about twenty years
ago, Davidson College was the
largest employer in the area.
The days of a black janitor
working for the College for
twenty years and retiring to
find himself without any retire-
ment pension, or of a black
being let go for complaining or
organizing other workers, are
gone. Since 1975-76, benefits
have been brought up to the
level of faculty, administration,
and office clerical staff benefits.
Wages for custodians have gone
from a maximum of $1.55 per
hour in 1966-67 to $3.91 per
hour in 1979-80.

College President Samuel.
Spencer said ‘‘I think the
College should be a leader in
wages and benefits, not a
follower.”’

Problems still exist, however.
The Bill Rolland dispute earlier
this year indicates that some of
the heavy-handedness survives.
Cooks on Patterson Court still
have no retirement plan and
they got unemployment com-

Lowry. ‘‘When we went and
talked to the people on the hill
(at the College) they said they
don’t employ us, the houses do,

to us either. They’re wishy-
washy,”’ said White.

The College has historically
had fewer employment relations
with the white community
around Delburg Street (one
block north of Griffith Street,
behind Bridgeport Fabrics).

~ Members of this community

have traditionally worked at
one of the two mills in town,
either the asbestos plant or the
spinning mill. This
known as the Davidson Mill
Village, broke up when the
blacks started moving into the
low-rent ‘‘shot-gun’”’ houses the
College moved from behind the
Post Office to Griffith Street.
According to Salinda May-
hew, lifetime Davidson res-
ident, the College moved these
houses (earlier used by married
students) right into the mill
people’s backyards’’ F.L.
“Cash” Jackson was. mayor of
the town and at the same time

- secretary at the College.

“Some land was sold. People
had no idea what was going on,
nobody was told they were
doing this,”” Mayhew said. The
white people scattered, and the
mills closed down.

Now most of the Delburg area
residents work in industries
outside Davidson or are retired,
and have little connection with
the College.

Recreation
vidson are. probably the most
important issue facing the town
now. Mayor Nancy MacCormac

explained that “‘the College has
in the past provided outlets for
recreation. Recently, the Col-
lege has had to draw gradually
back.”’ ‘

Davidson College Security
Officer Harold Cook, referring
to the community’s use of
college facilities, said ‘“Things
have gotten out of hand. Now
we're having to use more con-
trol.” He that with
the increasing n of stu-
dents there is a strain on
existing facilities, and that with
400-500 women on campus now,

at KA, active in the black
community aswell as a past
member of the Town Parks and
Recreation Committee, said

' “Now the policemen harass the

kids over there (at the College).
I understand they do it to white
kids but more so to blacks.”

to events at the College than do
