Debrah McColl brings
‘energy’ to Davidson

By ANNE PELFREY
Associate Editor

I met Debrah McColl Wed-
nesday afternoon, before she
began performing in the 900
room.

What’s she like?

“Oh, she’s like Laura
Nero,’’ several people told me.

‘She sings and plays the
piano. You know the type.”’

Yes, I thought I knew the
type and I half expected some
soulful eyed woman to slump
into the room moaning about
“the bad drug scene’”’ and the
trials of having an abortion.

But instead, I was surprised
by her smile and her quiet
ehergy.

“Almost everything/1 sing
is optimistic. I do’a lot of
ballads and they have a slow
tempo. And I do some songs
_ that are introspective. But I
really believe in optimism,”’
she said. :

Yet her hope is not childlike.
This petite curly headed wo-
man has passed through seve-
‘ ral’ transitions in her music
career. She was a member of
three different groups before
she came to work as a soloist.

“I was about 17 when I
started working with Kindred
Spirits. We were a folk group
and we sang songs trying to
change the world and to make
everybody love each other,”
she smiled. »

“After that, I was with a
group called Chakra. That was
a rock band. We were sup-
posed to be like a southern
Jefferson Airplane, but we
really had.an L.A. sound:

“That didn’t work and I
joined. a band called Silver-
man,” she said.

She worked with Silverman
for three years.

“We tried real hard. We.

. busted ass. We were in New
York several times and we

even had a show case at a good
club. We were presented to
Columbia, Atlantic, and Elec-
tra record companies. But if
you're presented to the com-
panies by someone they don’t
respect, it’s not good,’’ she
said.

So she comments on making
a success of the music busi-
ness in this way:

“Tt’s real political.’’

From what she says, it
seems that a performer. can
learn how to be successful by
studying the likes and dislikes
of the audiences.

“Let’s face it. When ‘you
start being a recording artist,
you become a product that’s
marketed. But I don’t care
about the business part. I’d
rather just keep playing my
music and having fun. And I
just keep thinking, maybe
idealistically, that the right
producer will hear me and like
it,” she said.

And when that happens,
don’t expect Debrah McColl to
be lost in the “flash” of
success.

‘‘My idea of success is to be

constantly growing in my.

mysic. I don’t cater to any-
body except a mature | aud-
ience,”’ she said.

But is there anyone who has’:
“made it’’ without obliging —

the youth culture’s, whims?
“Melissa Manchester is an
example. She’s successful, yet

she retains the music that is . ©

her,” she said.
Debrah ‘McColl uses -son;

written by other people, but -
she also uses some of her own |

material. ee
“Most of it.concerns strong

feelings about people relation-.

ships, and things that -moti-
vate people. Last night, f was

asked what I’d do if I lost my |

voice. I-said that I’d study
psychology. I’m really interes-
ted in people,” she said. .

Dr. Radu Florescu speaks about his “Search for
Dracula” Monday in Love Auditorium

Florescu lectures on —
‘Dracula: horror. stories

By MATTHEW COVINGTON -
Executive Editor +

"A direct, descendant of a Romanian
family that witnessed the horrors of.
Count Dracula comes to Davidson

December 8.. Dr. Radu Florescu, the cas
last of a line that traces itself back ‘to

15th century Romania, will conduct
an’ Open End at 4:00 p.m. in the
Morrison Room and give a lecture,
“In Search of Dracula,” at 8:00 iy
in Love Auditorium.

Florescu, a professor at Boston
University, traces his family back to a
Florescu mentioned in some of Count-

Dracula’s documents. Apparently

this first Florescu was an ally of *

Dracula’s brother Rady thé Hand-
some. Radu the Handsome dedicated
his life to removing his brother from
power.

Blood-sucking monster

Count Dracula was not the blood- -

wrote about, but it.is doubtless that
Stoker took the-story ef the historic
