By MARVIN OVERBY
Staff Writer

The Board of Trustees will not
formally consider College athletic policy
at their meeting May 8 and 9, according
to Vice President for Academic Affairs
Price Zimmerman.

Athletics was to have been the
primary topic of the meeting. It has been

omitted because the Athletic Evalua-

tion Committee, who visited in April,
have not completed their report, Assis-
tant to the President John Cunningham
and Zimmerman said.

The report was due May 1. It had not

Because of the delay the Trustees will
probably wait until their October meet-
ing before considering changes in athle-
tics, Cunningham said.

According to Cunningham, College
President Samuel Spencer said there is
‘nothing major’’ on issue for the
Trustees ‘to consider, but that he may
add items to the agenda at the last
minute.

Items that are on the Trustee’s agenda
include reports by the Education Com-
mittee, the Finance Committee, the
Religion Policy and Program Commit-

Committee.

The Education Committee will consi-
der tenure appointment for Biology
Professor Verna Case and Drama Profes-
sor Joseph Gardner. They will also
discuss faculty promotions and sabbati-
cal applications.

The Finance Committee will hear
reports from the College’s three invest-
ment counselors as well as one by
Wachovia Trust Company on the Col-
lege’s endowments. Business Manager
Robert Currie said the Committee will
also review the status of property the

Regular year end reports will be made
by Dean of Students Will Terry and
Minister of Students Rush Otey to the
Religious Policy and Program Commit-
tee and one Student Life and Health
Committee. Terry said nothing ‘‘impor-
tant” is contained in these reports.

When asked what will happen to the
report of the AEC when it arrives,
Cunningham said that it would be given
to the Advisory Council on Inter-
collegiate Athletics and the Trustees’
Athletic Committee. Afterwards, Spen-
cer would like to have the report

$5 PIRG bill
checkoff

approved

By GLENN KELLUM
Assistant News Editor

This summer’s tuition bill
will include a five dollar charge
for PIRG in the form of a
positive check-off.

The sentence, ‘‘If you wish to
contribute to PIRG, add
$5.00,’’ will be included on
students’ summer bills, accord-
ing to College President Samuel
Spencer.

PIRG chapter chairman Su-
san Marynowski said, ‘We're
pleased that (Spencer) has ap-
proved the positive check-off.””

A letter about PIRG was
included in last fall’s billing
information telling parents
“they should add the contribu-
tion to PIRG if they desired to
do so,” Spencer said. Essential-
ly, this was a positive check-off
system. However, no informa-
tion about PIRG was actually
written on the bill itself, Mary-
nowski said.

Also, a pamphlet about
PIRG was included in last fall’s
bill which was written by the
PIRG chapter. This pamphlet
told parents they should deduct
the PIRG charge from the bill.
Those who composed the
pamphlet were still under the
impression that the PIRG bill-
ing was still governed by a
negative check-off system,
Marynowski said.

Compared to nearly $4000
raised in past years, only $200
was acquired this year. This
means that fifty people sifted
through the conflicting infor-
mation in the bill, which Mary-

Town Police Chief Mills
believes stolen students’
bikes taken out of town

By JOHN SIMAN
News Editor

Davidson Police Chief R.H.
Mills said several ‘‘different
groups” of people are stealing
Davidson students’ and towns-
people’s bicycles ‘and taking
them ‘to other cities — where
‘it’s pretty hard to trace
them.” ©

“We're assured (many sto-

len bicycles) have been taken
out of town,’ Mills said. But
the police have had little suc-
cess so far in tracking either the
bicycles or the thieves.

Sophomore Keith Hearle,
whose bicycle was stolen last
week, said he heard that a
“‘ring...operates in this area
who steal bicycles, take them to
Concord, spray paint them, and
redistribute them.”

However, Campus Security
Director J.G. Hughes said that
students’ bicycles have not been

~ taken to Concord—although

many stolen bicycles have been
found there. Mills confirmed
Hughes’s findings. ‘‘Concord

Class of ‘84 male-female ratio nearly 2:1

By SCOTT EBLIN
Staff Writer
Selected from) the largest
number of applicants in David-
son history, the class of 1984
will be composed of 250 men
and 130 women, according to
Admissions Director John Grif-
fith,
The students, were chosen
from a total of 1556 a”
1020 men and §35 women.

2:1, Griffith, explained,
Richardson Dorm holds
women.

The reason for the approxi-
mate 2:1 ratio is “more tradi-
tion than anything else,” ac-
cording to Griffith. “Davidson

..is exemplary of a school that
‘doesn’t quite know what it’s

going to be with regards to the
composition of the student bo-

dy.”

Since the number of female
applicants is growing while
male applicants are down, Grif-
fith foresees a possible change
in the ratio that would corre-
spond with the number of
available students.

Griffith said he is pleased
with the ‘‘very high overall
quality”’ of next year's fresh-
men. Academically, their over-

all record is slightly higher than
those of classes in the recent

- past,

Approximately 68% of the

group comes from Florida,

Georgia, Virginia, and North

°**Carolina. ‘There is no policy to

emphasize recruiting. in the
Northeast.

The College is “‘very com-
fortable with the present geo-
graphical distribution,” Griffith
said. :

Explaining that every
school’s strength lies in its
“high yield area,”’ Griffith said
that ‘“‘the strength of Davidson
is in the South. We're the
leading liberal arts college in the
South, not the leading liberal
arts college in New Jersey.” pe

Though the Admissions De-
partment is seeking to make the
student body “as heterogeneous
as possible,” Griffith Said, “ge-
ography is not the only factor. .

While it would be “too homo-

“geneous” if all Davidson stu-

dents came from the South,
Griffith said “it would change
the character of the school to
have a dispropartionate emount
from the Northeast.”

We made our first trip to New

said. “‘When we go to the
Northeast we are simply in-
terested in getting the very best
students possible.”

had more (stolen) bicycles than
anywhere else,’”’ he said.. But
‘*We’ve gone over and checked”
and no students’ bicycles were
found:

Mills said ‘“‘a month or so
ago’’ Davidson police got a
report of people taking bicycles
from around town and loading
them onto a camper. Millis
apprehended the camper before
it reached Mooresville and ar-
rested the suspects.

“The judge couldn’ * find
them guilty because the stu-
dents (whose bicycles were sto-
len) wouldn’t show up (at the
trial), Mills said.

‘‘We continuously keep an
eye on people we've caught in
the past,’’ Mills said. However,
since thefts have continued
even after a few arrests, Mills is
sure that ‘‘different people’”’
steal each time.

Mills said he did not know the
exact number of bicycle thefts
this year, but that there were
“lots from both students and
townspeople.”’

Hughes said very few thefts
have been reported to him this
year. However, he :believes
many students neglect to do so.

Dean of Students Will Terry
said, ‘In the event there is even
a rumor of this, students ought
to be more careful about keep-
ing their bicycles locked.”

Two recévered bicycles are
now locked in the Davidson jail,
Mills said. He is waiting for the
owners to pick them up.
