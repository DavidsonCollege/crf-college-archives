Wilbur Carter, junior 175 pounder, has been a consistent point winner

for the grunt and groan artists lately after getting off to a rather slow

start. Carter, with undefeated Hipp, has been the only Wildcat to win
in the last two matches.

Most of Davidson's entrants in the Southern Conference Indoor

Games boast hurdling among their accomplishments.

The quintet shown

here are, reading from left te, right, Bill Lacy, Arch Taylor,, High

who will make the trip is Gene Shannon, pole vault entry.

After dropping the opening game
of a short two day road trip to
Charleston, the Cats came back to
win four straight during the last
week. College of Charleston nosed
out the Cats 33 to 29, but on the
following night, Davidson trounced
the Citadel in an overtime period,
32-30, Then the Cats returned home
to hand out lickings to The Citadel
in a return match, Furman and Wof-
ford. The win over-Firman, which
also was an overtime period, was
especially to-Coach Shepherd's boys
since it dropped Furman from the
first eight teams in the conference,
thereby eliminating them from the
tournament.

Wayman Hot

Jack Wayman was the big man
in the Cats triumph over the Citadel
at Davidson when he paced the
squad with eight field goals to rack
up 16 ponts. Two days later John
Belk led the Cats their 34-29
win over the Purple Hurricane from
Furman with 11 points.

In their final game of the week,
again: defeated Wofford
College, this time by a 49 to 35
margin. George Marsh” led the
Cats with 14 markers.

Furman Tonight

The varsity five played the South
Carolina Gamecocks in the David-
son gym last Tuesday night, and
journeyed to Furman today to take
on the Purple Hurricanes at night.
The Cats took’the measure of this
fast moving squad in a close game
last week, but they may find it a
little tougher sailing on the Hurri-
canes own court.

In the last ‘game of the season
the Cats will meet a team from the
Norfolk ~Naval Base in a return
game at Davidson this Saturday.
