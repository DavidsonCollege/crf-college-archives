Despite Loss, Cats Hold
To Best Post-War Record

The 1954 football season is scarcely a month old, but al-
ready thousands of fans throughout the country have seen
some very startling upsets take place on the several week
ends. This past week-end, the upset fever hit the Carolinas,
as Wake Forest played mighty Maryland to a tie, 13-13; Clem-
son defeated Florida, 18-7; and the Blue Hose of Presbyterian

College surprised our Wildcats by the score of 10-7.

If one considered the individual
players on each team, the previous
records of the two, and other “in-
cidentals,” the P.C. boys didn’t
belong on the same field with the
‘Cats. However, it was Homecom-
ing there, and the Blue Hose man-
aged to get “up” for the game and
played what will undoubtedly be
their best game of the season. In
contrast, the ‘Cats played their
worst, as the results would indi-
cate.

Statistics Lie

When looking at the statistics,
the score is even more surprising.
The 'Cats ran up a total of 14 first
downs to 12 for P.C. and outgain-
ed the Hose on the ground, 184
yards to 135. The Blue Hose quar-
terback, Harry Hamilton, held a
slight, edge over the 'Cat’s quar-
terbacks in passing, completing 7
of 17 for 80 yards, while Little,
Belton and Rowland could com-
plete only 3 of 12 for 62 yards.

Hamilton’s punting kept the
"Cats in the shadow of their own
goal posts and accounted for two
safeties in the first quarter. The
first came when the Hose left end,
Bob Jackson, drove Harley Smith
into the end zone after Smith had
received a Hamilton punt. Minutes
later, Jackson blocked one of
Smith’s punts, breaking through
the line without being touched.
The ball rolled out of the end
zone, giving P.C. another two-
pointer and a 4-0 lead as the quar-
ter ended.

The P.C. touchdown came as a
direct result of Davidson miscues
in the second period. A 16-yard
penalty against the ‘Cats for
roughness and, later, a pass inter-
ference called on a ‘Cat back gave
the Hose the ball on the three.

Two plays later Hamilton sneaked.

over from the one. .

The lone ‘Cat touchdown came
in the opening minutes of the last
quarter, with Dyke Little's 5-yard
plunge on fourth and goal to go

climaxing a 90-yard drive. The
‘Cats had been knocking at the
door all during the third period,
after failing to pass the 50 yard-
line in the first half. Key plays in
the second half comeback were a
25-yard run and a 22-yard pass re-
ception by alternate-captain and
left halfback Jim Thacker. The
conversion after the touchdown
was made by Bob Talbert, who is
fast becoming known as the boy
with the magic toe.

‘Cat supporters were happy to
see Harry Peterson and Dickie Da-
vis back in action after being out
with injuries, and both will be at
full steam against Furman on Oc-
tober 22.

After winning three straight and
getting a little too much confi-
dence, the 'Cats were due for a let-
down, and we should be happy
that it came against P.C. and not
against Furman, our strongest
Southern Conference foe. Now
we're ready to play real football
and reduce the “Purple Hurricane”
to a gentle breeze!

WILDCAT NETTERS
BEGIN WORKOUTS

Davidson's fall tennis workouts
started on the local courts this
week, and round-robin play has
already begun among the hopefuls
who are trying out for the team.

With two spots on the varsity
made vacant by graduation, com-
petition is keen among the sopho-
mores and freshmen who will fill
these holes.

With freshmen eligible this sea-
son, and with the experienced aid
of the sophomores, the prospects
for a fine season look very en-
couraging.

Wildeat Harriers Hit
Richmond Tomorrow

BY JOHN JOHNSON

Davidson's cross-country team won the opening meet of
the '54 season by defeating Maryville College on the loser’s
course in Maryville, Tennessee. The Wildcat runners took four

of the first six places and edged the Scotties, 25 to 32. Vanden-
burg and McWilliams of Maryville placed first and third; Pete
Ashcraft, captain Floyd Feeney, Dick Lovette, and Gerald Wil-
son placed second, fourth, fifth, and sixth for Davidson. John
Patterson, John Handley, Bill Walker, and Gordon Bondurant
were the other four members of the fast Wildcat squad. Coach
“Pete” Whittle said that he was proud of the showing that
his boys made.

It was an impressive win against tough competition. Be-
cause the Scotties do not have a regular track team, they con-
centrate on cross-country and produce some excellent run-
ners.

This Davidson win evens the series between the two
schools with one win apiece and one tie. Maryville won in
1952, and the tie resulted from last year’s contest.

Davidson’s first '54 Southern Conference meet, which is
also this year’s first home meet, will be tomorrow, October
16, with Richmond. The Wildcat squad will be out for it’s
second victory of the season.

Davidson's Golfers
Hit Morganton Club

Davidson's golf prospects travel
to Morganton, North Carolina, to-
morrow for their first fall match
of the season. About fifteen men
will make the trip which will pit
some of the best golfers in North
Carolina against the defending
Southern Conference champions.

The Morganton Country Club will
supply the competition for the
Wildcats, and the Western North
Carolina city has turned out a fine
crop of linksters. Sports fans are
already quite familiar with one of
the Morganton products, one Billy
Joe Patton. There is a possibility
that Patton will be in the group
which will face Davidson, but the
Morganton Club professional, Joe
Cheves, has not announced the
names of those in the group.

The Davidson team will be com-
posed of those students who have
shown interest in the team and
have indicated that they would
like to make the trip. Joe Jenkins,
Southern Conference runner-up
last spring, will head the list of
Wildeat golfers who are making
the trip.

(43), Davidson end, moves in on the play, and Dyke Little, (27), Wildcat quarterback who started the—

only touchdown.

Cenric ADAMS says: “When I was at the University of
Minnesota, learning to be a reporter for the Daily, I ved on
peanut butter sandwiches. It took me nine years to
graduate (with time out to earn tuition!) When I married
and went to work as a cub for the Star, I lived on love
and.macaroni. I worked like a horse writing about every-
thing on earth, before I made the grade as a columnist.
Now I'm eating better — even better than a horse!”

Open 1954 Season
With McCallie Today

Davidson’s Junior Varsity foot-

ball team made its 1954 debut this!

afternoon when the Wildkittens
met McCallie School here at Rich-
ardson Field. The contest was slat-

ed to get under way at 3:00 p. m./f

Yesterday the “J.V." coaches,
Bill Acker and Charlie Cousar, an-
nounced the probable starting line-
up for the Kittens, with freshmen
carrying the brunt of the load. The
squad is very weak in the depth
department, and only twenty-two
men dressed for the game.

McCallie, today's opponent, had
a record of two wins and one loss
prior to the battle with the Wild-
kittens. The Blue Tornado took
wins over Westminster (of At-
lanta) and Notre Dame Prep of
Chattanooga. Chattanooga High
School handed the McCallie crew
their only loss, 7-6. McCallie is
coached: by former Davidson star,
Dave Spencer.

The starting line-up for David-
son, as given reporters yesterday,
is: Dave Fagg and Dan Everhard
at ends, Bob Talbert and Brown
Hamer at tackles, Dave McClain
and Bob Stancil at guards, Gene
Reid at center, Ollie Harris in the
quarterback slot, Harry Hienitch
at fullback, and Ralph Setzler and
Arthur Lynn at the halves.

‘BULLETIN

As e@ result of the bad weath-
er caused by Hurricane Hazel
this afternoon’s game between
Davidson JVs and McCallie was
cancelled.

Fall tennis is well
under way on the Da-
vidson scene, and local
courts are being put to
plenty of use almost
every afternoon. Var-
sity players of last
year have been getting
into shape, and some
close battles have
been played. But there
were few witnesses to
one of the most excit-
ing matches in recent
months. It was played
last week in the late ¢
afternoon when the
courts were almost de-
serted.

It was a doubles match, and all of the contestants had a
connection with Davidson, though each was in a different field
of life. It was, however, a very impressive foursome. On one
side of the net were Lacy Keesler, current Southern Confer-
ence champion and top Davidson netter, and Whit Cobb, for-
mer Southern Conference “Athlete of the Year” and Southern
doubles champ. Whit is now in the insurance business in Dur-
ham.

Facing Keesler and Cobb from the other side of the net
were Dick McKee, director of Davidson's tennis fortunes, and
William Paton, former Big Ten champion. Since finishing col-
lege, Paton has played at Wimbledon and Forest Hills in some
of the top amateur tournaments. He is now a member of the
Davidson Business Administration department.

It was .just a friendly get-together, with wisecracks oc-
casionally going faster than the game. But the quality of the
tennis was a pleasure to watch. Though the four men were
playing together for the first time, there was no mistaking
the fact that there were four veterans of the game on the
courts. After seeing some of the sloppy play exhibited in the
conference tourney here last spring, it was a bit of tennis not
easily forgotten.

Incidentally, McKee and Paton, the.‘‘old men” of the four-
some, finally emerged as the winners, though the match was
close all the way.

Paton is helping Coach McKee with fall practice and
should be a big help, since two instructors can give more in-
dividual help than one, and with the calibre of tennis David-
son turns out, this individual help with the problems of exper-
ienced players is what is needed in most cases.

-It seems that the time for a decision has come for David-
son’s 1954 footballers. Riding high on a three-game winning
streak, the Wildcats ran into a fired-up Presbyterian College
club last Friday, and the streak was abruptly brought to a
halt. A little over-confident, the Wildcats were pushed all.
over the field during the first half before they realized, too
late, that “little P.C.” wasn’t so little after all. Though almost
all of the “breaks” went against the Cats, the game still goes
into the record book as a loss. -

But with the P.C. battle now a thing of the past, David-
son faces an even more formidable opponent. Furman’s Pur-
ple Hurricane, without a doubt, is the strongest opponent on
the Davidson schedule this season. Popson, the Paladin’s ace
halfback, has torn opposing lines to shreds all year. The only
loss Furman has suffered this season was at the hands of
South Carolina (who, if you will recall, also beat Army).

So, undoubtedly, the Cats will have a battle on their
hands. But when nearly four hundred students went to Clin-
ton last week, they expected P.C. to have a pretty rough
night. We hope the Wildcats will take advantage of the les-
son learned the hard way last week. Not being over-awed by
a strong opponent's press clippings brought Presbyterian a
win. This could do the same thing for Davidson next Friday.
So the time for a decision has come. Are we going to roll over
and play dead next Friday against the powerful Furman club,
or will it be an upset with Davidson on the winning end this
time.
