Fall Convocation date
creates inconvenience

By Cyab WELLMON
Staff Writer

Instead of hundreds of parents
and students filling the chairs of
the Fall Convocation next month,
hundreds of alumni and off cam-
pus visitors, celebrating the end of
amammoth fund raising campaign,
will form the audience.

The class of 1996 will have
their Fall Convocation on October
6, when most students will be mak-
ing their way to their much-antici-
pated Fall Break destinations.

But why is Fall Convocation
scheduled on a day of exodus in-
stead of the usual date, parents’
weekend, when the chairs are filled

by proud parents and friends?

Dr. Kelton, organizer of the
convocation, says the date of the
Fall Convocation was moved to
the 6th of October to become a part
of a weekend of celebration, fo-
cusing on the completion of a $158
million dollar, five-year fund rais-
ing campaign.

According to Dean of Students
Tom Shandley, the change of date
is atemporary, one year occurence.

After black tie dinners and
receptions, leaders, donors, and
workers for the campaign will take
their places in the audience and
applaude the achievements of the
class of 1996.

Brademas, President Emeritus of
New York University, who will be
the speaker for the convocation.

After the Convocation cer-
emonies, the campaign festivities
continue with an elaborate lun-
cheon. The SGA will select a
small number of students to be
included ‘on the invitation list.

When asked to comment on
the near certainty of low student
attendance and a high number of
visitors at convocation, Dr. Kelton
stated, “[That] will be up to the
students, because classes are not
over until 4:30.”

Reversal of roles

New position moves seniors into
critical role in admissions process

By WILL BRADSHAW
Staff Writer

In an attempt to individualize
the campus visit program and give
prospective students a chance to
interview current Davidson stu-
dents, a handful of seniors will be
chosen as the first Senior Admis-
sion Fellows on Wednesday, Sep-
tember 13th.

“As a department, we wanted
to engage the talents of current

Davidson students in the recruit-
ment and selection of future
Davidsonians.

We also want to give prospec-
tive students and their families a
kind of up close and personal in-
sight into the Davidson experience,
and the Senior Fellows will be
chosen on their ability to do those
things,” says Dean of Admissions
Dr. Nancy Cable.

The Senior Fellows will work

inconjunction with the admissions
staff eight to 10 hours per week,
ten weeks per semester. Their du-
ties will include giving individual
interviews, helping out at campus
events, and generally serving as an
adjunct member of the staff. They
will be paid a semester honorarium.

“One of the leading hallmarks
of Davidson has always been our
personalized and hospitable cam-

pus visit program,” Deborah Hogg,
Assistant Dean of Admission and

the program coordinator, said. “In

‘the last few years, however, our

staff has had a diminished ability
to meet one-on-one with students,
and the Senior Admissions Fel-
lows should enhance the individual
attention prospective students re-
ceive.”

There will be five to eight
Senior Fellows chosen, and due to
their addition the staff plans on
being able to offer eight individual

interyiews a day. These interviews, ,
Hogg stressed, will be optional and
non-evaluative. “It is an opportu-
nity for a prospective to interview
us about Davidson,” she said.

The Fellows will start their
training during Alumni Leadership
weekend which will occur on Sep-
tember 15th, 16th and 17th. After
which they will have two more
weeks of training in the admis-

sions office.

The system was modeled on
similar programs in place at schools
throughout the country. Last year,
the Admissions office collected
information from Dennison Uni-
versity, Connecticut College,
Dartmouth College, Depauw Uni-
versity, and Vanderbilt University
to help formulate ideas for the pro-
gram at Davidson.

The selection process for next
year’s Fellows will begin the week
after Spring Break.

Duke Divinity professor to speak

By MatrtHew Eiricu
News Editor

Stanley Hauerwas, professor
of theological ethics at the Duke
Divinity School, will speak in the
900 Room on Sunday the 17th and
Monday the 18th at 7:30 pm.

Hauerwas’ topic will be “Why

Christians Should Be Pacifists: The
Ethics of War and Peace.”
Hauerwas is a theologian who
has tried to show how Christian
convictions help affect lives.

Hauerwas firmly believes in
the importance of character and
virtue in understanding Christian

ethics. In his writings, he also
emphasizes the importance of a
“Story-Shaped Community” —the
church — as the necessary polity
for Christian formation and moral
reflection.

Among his many books are
Preaching to Strangers and the
Encyclopedia of Bioethics.

assess and “document everything
from the broadest to the narrowest;
from our statement of purpose to
the number of paperclips we use.”

Nelson and Hansford Epes,
the editor of the Self-Study are
finalizing their report for this first

half ofthe study. The accredidation’

procedure, Epes says, has a dual-

purpose: “To allow us to assess
ourselves and others to assess us.”

Davidson is one of eighteen
schools who were selected last year
to undertake a modified version of

the Self-Study. Nelson predicts.

that Davidson might even be the
first of all of the schools to com-
plete this half of the study.
Attention will soon turn to the
Focus Committees. They will un-
dergo a consultative study of five
areas: education (especially sci-

ence), quality of student life, infor-
mation technology, athletics, and
financial management. Members _
of the faculty will co-chair each of
the committees.
The SACS will select specialists in
these five areas to visit and review
Davidson in October.

“This self-study is gratifying,
but extremely ambitious. It is a
monumental job, but crucial for
the future of the College,” says
President John Kuykendall.
