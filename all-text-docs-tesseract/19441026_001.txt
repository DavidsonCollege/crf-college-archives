Four members of the David-
son Student Body were recent-
ly. honored by receiving. re-
quests for their biographies to
be listed in the 1944-45 editidn
of Who’s Who Among Students
in American Universities and
Colleges.

New Members
The who

this publication were Andy Owens,

men were honored by
Jim Alexander, Jim Lowry, and Jim
Love, who were selected by an a-
nonymous committee because of
their excellence in various forms of

ee wags
campus activities.

Purpose
The ptirpose of this publication is
to create ona national basis recog-
enition for students. The first edition
of Who’s Who was printed in 1934-
35. Beaides

which is the recognition of outstand-

its primary purposie

ing students in college life, it also
serves as a source of recommenda-
tion for these students as employees

in the business world.

Requisites
According to the editor, “requi-
sites for membership are character,
scholarship, leadership, and extra-
curricular activities, and potentiality
for future usefulness” business
and society. Juniors, and
students in advance work are eligi-
bie. Realizing that the outstanding
men and women will be more -valu-
able than ever before (after the
war), we plan to follow the needs
of companies and individuals. For
those firms requiring employees,
we propose to seek desirable pros-
pects; for those students listed in
our books in any year since its be-
ginning, we propose to seek desir-
able positions.

“It is our purpose to keep these
leading graduates before the manu-
‘facturers as the most promising
candidates for employment.”

This and That
From the ASTRP.

Well, dear reader, are
again to bring you the latest from
the ASTRAPS.

The ASTRP, dance was a huge
success. It was the first formal
dance held by the ASTRP since

they arrived at Davidson. The suc-
of the dance, due mainly to
the efforts of Headquarters and the
untiring enthusiasm of Mr. and
Mrs. York of Conoord, N. C., was
bett@r than it was expected to be.
While we are on the subject of
dances we should mention the dance

at China Grove last Friday night
at which the ASTRAP'’s orchestra
played: The military band went

along as guests-of the school. The
swing band made a very good show-
ing the
first dance to be held at the China
Grove High School. I
boys enjoyed the dance very much.
One might ask Lt. Tom Aiola to
teach them how to Solo jitterbug.
It seems that he is ansexpert at this
art.

won't hurt—let’s take a trip. The
time? Let’s say between 2200 and
2230, just: before taps. Suppose we
go to the third floor of Duke. The
first thing we sce a game of
cards, just a little something to re-
lax the boys after a hard 2 hours
of study and a hard day's work. We
go a little further and we note the
happy tone of the boy's voices as
they sing and whistle in the showers,
happy because they have only six
weeks left in this term. Next, down
on the second floor, here you had
better take a life raft, because you
are liable to see a cadet officers’
bed floating down the hall, the prac-
tical joke that some bright student
has done. By the time we reach the
first floor we can hardly stand be-
cause we are so tired of walking
trying to get from one side of the
building to the other. It seems as
though the dorm was made this
way to stop the boys from playing
baseball, but that doesn’t stop them.
On this floor we ‘see the famous

Now let’s take a trip over to the
East Dorm. We'll start at the base-
ment this time. Here we see “Bugs
Bunny” and all his bunnies... One
should say Lt. Col. Furman. One
might see the dashing figure of
Victor Heidgerkén, the big game
hunter. (He brings them back by
the tail)’ Vic has found his latest
game hiding under a chewing gum
wrapper in the trash can. It was a
mouse.
