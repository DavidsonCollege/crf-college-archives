—Swimming—

(Continued from page 5)
sophomore year.

Coach Miller unhesitatingly

praises Davidson's most dili-
gent swimmer: ‘‘I’ve never
coached anybady who’s worked
harder nor anybody’ more,dedi-
cated. Even though Mark miss-
ed school because of mono his
freshman year, he came back for
the championship and won in
the fly event.’’ From that
freshman year, Tommerdahl
improved during his junior year
by capturing the 400 IM, 200
fly, and 500 free in the confer-
ence championship.
_ How important is swimming
to Tommerdahl? His rommate
Steve Risley confides that,
‘Swimming is everything to
him—he eats, sleeps, and talks
swimming.’’ Tommerdahl has
put in about the same number
of hours swimming as he has
academically. Interestingly e-
nough, swimming has meant a
great deal socially to Tommer-
dahl: ‘‘I’ve found many friends
through swimming. It’s almost
like a fraternity now—the com-
radeship is important to me.”

Mark’s nickname among
some teammates is ‘‘Animal’’.
Risley posits two reasons for
this nickname. ‘‘First of all,
Mark swims the hardest events
of the meet (the 1000 free, 200
fly, and 500 free). Only an
animal like Mark could consis-
tently do this. Secondly, Mark
shows his animalistic tenden-
cies the minute he jumps into
the water.’’ Mark himself
thinks the nickname is fitting:
“It’s my mentality.”

Afghanistan

(Continued from page 3)

Karachi port large quantities of American goods intended for
delivery to Afghanistan. Pakistan’s military alliance with the US
on one side, and Afghanistan’s reliance on American economic
assistance through AID on the other, prevented the US from
exerting pressure on either side. However, due to American efforts
a transit route was tried through Iran, which though not
satisfactory, relieved to some extent Afghanistan’s heavy
dependence on the Soviet Union. During the summer of 1963,
mainly due to American persuasion, the Shah of Iran agreed to
mediate between Afghanistan and Pakistan and an agreement to
open the Khyber Pass was reached on May 23. After a break of 22
months the border with Pakistan opened again.

But clashes had created an intense distrust, suspicion and even
hostility between Afghanistan and Pakistan. As a result,
Afghanistan consistently supported India over Pakistan. During
the 1965 war between India and Pakistan it is even reported that
Afghanistan threatened to invade Pakistan.

In the closing years of the 1960s, Afghanistan's relations with
the outside world were dominated by its relationships with the
Soviet Union and Pakistan. The possibility of carving an
independent Pushtunistan out of Pakistan could give Afghanistan
more dependable access to the outside world. The 1972 war in the
Indian subcontinent between India and Pakistan, and the
consequent creation of Bangladesh, has fanned Afghanistan’s
hopes of an independent Pushtunistan. The post-1973 history can
be found in a brief report published in the N.Y. Times on
December 28, 1979.

job interviews that we allow on
campus are horrible! The hiring
of our students is hopelessly
biased toward the better quali-
fied. There’s no excuse for this!
I suggest that we ban all
on-campus interviews until
such time as IBM, NCNB and
all the other companies that
might want to interview here
adopt a self-selective hiring
program with respect to David-
son students. A tentative sys-
tem might be to have interested
applicants sign up for the three
or four jobs that they wanted
the most (assuming that the

weren’t encouraged they could
