cover, border, and canvas are all mack
of hand-woven cloth. The border and
hanging are of coarse material like bur-
lap, while the canvas is of much finer

teXture.

This painting bears some kind. of re
ligious symbolism. In the center is the
picture of a god who appears to be
sitting upon some kind of beast. Sur-

rounding him are horsemen all of whom |
are dressed in a different attire.

Also within the case in which this
queer, mystical painting is preserved, is
a votive stone taken from a pile of |

similiar stones at a wayside shrine. Upon |
it are carved OM MANI PADME|!
