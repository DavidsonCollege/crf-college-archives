Right here, may we pay tribute to the |
new Wildcat captain, Arthur Baker. . His}

Did somebody say that the Wild-
cats would be easy meat for a big
team? We wonder what the sport
world isithinking after seeing them
fight Clemson to a stanstill, finally
losing the contest by the only pass
which the Tigers completed dur-
ing the entire scrap. Don’t ever
think that the boys from Monk
Younger’s school didn’t achieve a
great feat last Saturday. They
were doped to lose by three or
four touchdowns.

Thus read dispatches from the news-
papers: “The Davidson Wildcats fought
gamely and determinedly to hold the pow-
erful Clemson players in check.” “Their

Glory to the entire Wildcat line, par-
ticularly to those “Tough Twins,” David |
and Brock, and more power to Samuel |
Black and Richard Flinn for their stal-| &

wart defense back of the forward wall. |
|

The thing that tickles us about the
game Saturday is that none of the home |
men were injured to amount to anything. |
We will just have to get optimistic now
and predict three straight wins—Elon,

Wofford and Citadel, with the Charleston

Cadets furnishing by far the strongest |
opposition.
Captain Baker will lead his troopers |

against the Fighting Christians from E lon |
College this week-end, and after hearing |

that State lowered their sails to the tune | i

of 57-0, we shall risk Coach Monk's ire by |
hoping for at least a touchdown victory.
“And with luck,” as Mr. Monk says, “we
might beat them a little more.”

Little Zach Walker proved to be Elon’s
chief threat last year, and he was truly a
streak on the field. Better watch that lad
or he'll be pulling some money-shine that
might not be so funny to Davidson men,

At last, Alumni of U. N. C. should be
thoroughly satisfied with their opening
game. On the other hand, Wake Forest
might feel a litle hurt, and the rest of the
state teams might feel a little scared of an
offense that can roll up 65 points in 60
minutes of play. Wonder if they can keep
it up? We don't think so. At least, Da-

vidson men feel no féar of a beating like

that.
