DAVIDSON 28
WOFFORD 13

Around the Wildcat’s Lair

'CATS TACKLE
V..M. I.

RACASKIE NOGVELL 3

Well, boys, the old Davidson Wild-
cats continued their A-grade brand of
football, and took over the Wofford
Terriers, 28 to 13. Despite a first-
quarter Wofford touchdown, made
when Davidson second-stringers were
on the field, and another in the final
canto, the ’Cats were decidedly mas-
ters of the situation throughout the
game.

It would break the editor to
even present carnations this week,
much less orchids, as so many of
the local lads played some splen-
did ball. Take Dewey Hutchins,
for instance. That boy, who has
been used largely as a_ blocking
back, was given the ball on sev-
eral and checked out for
long gains. More power to him.
Then there was “Little Joe” Wing-

field, whose sweeping end runs, and
sharp off tackle thrusts largely aided
the Davidson cause. Wingfield made
the initial Davidson touchdown, and
also kicked the extra point. In this
line, ‘Davidson showed a_ decided
adeptness, four Wildcats trying the
after-touchdown kicks, and all making
good. Wingfield, Pittman, Hutchins,
and Ravenel were the men who did
the kicking.

Wimpy Ravenel, thrust into the
fracas in the last quarter, carved
his niche in the Hall of Fame when
he intercepted a pass on his own
10-yard marker, and raced through
the entire Wofford team before he
was finally nabbed on the Terrier
20-yard stripe. A touchdown fol-
lowed, largely as a result of this
spectacular run.

The line also comes in for a decided
share of praise. A. J. Potter, Charlie
Rives, John Siewers, Henry Cathey,
Coley Windham, Jim Morgan, and
, Julian. West all gave those Wofford
boys plenty to think about. Potter was
particularly outstanding.

The dynamo of the Wofford at-
tack was Bouknight, pile-driving
fullback. He ripped the Wildcat
line to shreds on several occasions,
and was largely responsible for
Wofford’s scoring two touchdowns.
The varsity tackles V. M. I. ‘this

week on Richardson Field, in what is
termed by many as the football classic
of the week. The two teams_have
met fifteen times before, with V, M. J.
holding an edge of two games in the
win column.

After success as a predictor in
the game with Wofford, the editor
predicts a victory for Davidson
over the Flying Squadron. In all
probability Mackorell and Willson
will be used sparingly or not at
all. This is a blow to the David-
son cause, but that string of backs
who showed what they could do
down at Spartanburg will be in
there and we still pick the ’Cats to
take the Cadets. ,

Backs like Legare, Burns, Verble,
and Ravenel showed plenty of fire
against Wofford, and should give those
massive V. M. I. forwards plenty to
worry about.

Army gave the V. M. I. boys a nice
32 to 0 shellacking last Saturday. How-
ever, this does not indicate weakness
at the Virginia school, but merely pow-
er at West Point. This was by no
means a poor showing as we can see,
when we compare the showing of the
V. M. I. boys with that of their neigh-
bors, the University of Virginia, who
bowed to Ohio State, 75 to 0.

Asa prognosticator, the old boy
picked fifteen right and six
wrong for a percentage of .714 in
his initial attempt, and so here
goes for this week with the ed’s
choice in capitals:

DAVIDSON vs. V. M. I.

WOFFORD vs. Lenoir-Rhyne.

CATAWBA vs. Newberry.

GUILFORD vs . Randolph-Ma-
con,

ROANOKE vs. Elon.

Western Carolina vs. APPALA-
CHIAN.

North Carolina vs. GEORGIA.

N. C. STATE vs. Florida.

Duke vs. TENNESSEE,

CLEMSON vs, George Wash-

WILDCATS WIN
OVER WOFFORD
ELEVEN 28-17

Fighting Davidson Team Scores
Four Touchdowns to Lick
Wofford

WOFFORD STUBBORN

Ravenel, Wingfield, and Willson
Furnish Thrills

With both teams showing decided
offensive power, the Davidson Wild-
cats took their annual game from the
Wofford Terriers by a score of 28 to
13, The game was played in Spartan-
burg last Saturday.

Coach Newton started his shock
troops for Davidson, and the Terriers
immediately took advantage of the
situation, and a short punt put them
in possession of the ball in mid-field
in the opening minutes of the game.
Here they began a drive, which with
Bouknight doing most of the ball-tot-
ing, was not stopped until Crouch had
gone over for the touchdown. An-
derson added the extra point to put
Wofford in the lead, 7 to 0.

The Wildcats immediately took the
situation in charge, and made their
touchdown drive. Holding the ball
around the 50-yard line, with fourth
down and two yards to go, Willson
tore around end for 30 yards before
being dropped, and successive line
plays by Wingfield and Mackorell
placed the ball in scoring position as
the quarter ended.

As the second period opened Wing-
field carried the ball over, and then
added the extra point from placement
to tie things up at 7 to 7.

Shortly thereafter Davidson gained
possession of the ball in mid-field, after
the Terriers had failed to gain in their
allotted four downs. Clever reverses
mixed with sparkling end runs put!
the Davidson boys again in scoring
territory, with “Schnoz” Willson buck-

ing-over for the touchdown. Hutchins
added the extra point with a well-di-
rected place kick. Score: Davidson

A Tribute

The entire sporting world was
saddened and greatly depressed to
hear last Tuesday of the death of
W. L. “Young” Stribling, South-
ern boxer. The game young fight-
er succumbed to peritonitis, which
set in following the crushing of his
pelvis and left foot in ‘a motor-
cycle accident two days before.

At this time, when his death is
so fresh in the minds of all of us
who love clean sports, and clean
sportsmanship, we feel that a word
in praise of “Young” Stribling is
decidedly in order.

Starting from the bottom, with
the aid of his father and mother,
who were his manager, trainer, and
best backers, this fighting Southern
boy rose through a series of minor
fights to arrive at a point just
short of the championship of the
world, However, even in that last
fight, when he was so hopelessly
battered by the heavy pounding of
the fists of the powerful Uhlan,
Max Schmeling, he fought game-
ly, scarcely able to see, until the
referee could no longer allow the
fight to continue, and awarded

hmeling a technical k 1

And so, even as he had lived, a
true son of the South, and as game
a lad as ever donned a glove and
climbed between the ropes, Strib-
ling passed on, surrounded by his
best backers, mother, father, wife,
and child, and fighting to the end.

CLEMSON WINS
IN GAME WITH
N.C. STATE 9-0

Duke Licks Wake Forest in Only
Big Five Battle

ARMY 32; V. M. I. 0

The Citadel Tied and W. & M.
Defeated

While Davidson was busy defeating
Wofford last Saturday afternoon, the
current football season was truly get-
ting-under way, with seven other con-
tests taking place in which the eight
remaining 1933 grid opponents of the
Wildcats participated.

The only Big Five battle of the day
was waged between Duke and Wake
Forest, the Blue Devils emerging the
victors with a. one-sided score of 22-0.
Vanderbilt had a struggle in defeat-
ing North Carolina, the score being
20-13.

Clemson scored an upset by over-
coming North Carolina State 9-0, as
the Elon Christians won a 7-6 victory
over the Langley Field Airmen, and
Army walloped V. M. I., Davidson’s
next opponent, by a score of 32 to 0.

The Newberry-Citadel game ended
in a 7-7 tie, while Washington and Lee
licked William and Mary, 7-0.

Although Duke was by no means
hard pressed to win Saturday, never-
theless Wake Forest was impressive,
even in defeat. The Demon Deacons
held Duke’s second string team to al-
most no gain in the first quarter, and
during the second period, the Blue
Devil varsity was able to ring up only
one tally. But the last half found
Duke playing a steadier game, to score
16 points and bring the total to 22.

Long forward passes featured the
game between Carolina and Vander-
bilt, with every touchdown coming as
the direct result of yardage gained
through aerial attacks. The Tar Heels
had an advantage in pass yardage,
with 139 to the Commodores’ 95, Car-
olina was outplayed during the entire

first canto, as Vanderbilt completed

|pass after pass to score two touch-
}downs; the» third score came in the

| fourth period.

| The high light of the Clemson-State
lencouhter was the performance of
|Clemson’s Alex Stevens, whose _bril-
\liant punting and running gave the
| Tigers the margin over State through-
lout the game. His punts averaged 37
| yards, one long boot in the first quar-
|ter traveling 75 yards to State's five-
|yard stripe,.-Moreover, Stevens pound-
ed the highly touted State line for a
total of 54 yards in 15 tries.

In the game with Langley Field Air-
|men, the Elon Christians found them-
jselves trailing 6-0 as the half ended.
| But the North Carolinians played bet-
ter ball in the third period, pushing
over a touchdown, and then gaining

pass to Brownley.

into tow very easily, showing great
speed as King and Buckler made long
gains through the line and returned
punts for considerable yardage.. The
passing attack of the West Pointers
proved to be of great strength when
Army made four touchdowns in the
second and third quarters.

Citadel was highly rated to win over
Newberry, but only a last-minute
touchdown enabled them to tie the
Indians, 7 to 7. Both teams failed to
show any substantial drive during the
first three periods, and as the fourth
quarter began, both were scoreless.

Davidson to Engage Cadets Here
Saturday in Annual Classic

FIFTEENTH CONTEST

Wildcats Superior to Squadron
Paper

The Wildcats will play their second
home game of the season Saturday
with V. M. I’s “Flying Squadron”
furnishing the opposition.

Although the Cadets have not done
so well this year, ‘they are expected
to put up a hard fight and Coaches
Newton and McEver are drilling their
charges accordingly.

Davidson will probably enter the
game Saturday the slight favorites as
far as comparative scores go, and as
far as the previous showing of the
two teams is concerned. In the three
games that Davidson has played so
far, two are in the won column and
one in the lost column, while V. M. I.
has lost all three of their games, al-
though they faced much stronger op-
position. The Wildcats have scored
34 points to their opponents’ 19, while
the Cadets have countered 6 points to
their opponents’ 89.

V. M. I.’s opening game of the sea-
son was somewhat of a disappoint-
ment, being defeated 20-0 by a strong
Emory and Henry team. In their sec-
ond game of the season the Cadets
played the powerful Duke University
team at Greensboro and were swamped
37-6 in a one-sided contest.

The only Cadet score came as a
result of a blocked punt, which was
recovered by V. M. I. and converted
into a touchdown in the first period
of the game.

The beautiful punting of Penn, V.
M. I. end, held off more than one
attack and was one of the outstand-
ing features of the game, while Meri-
deth Urick, quarterback, did very well
in the backfield.

Last Saturday the Cadets were taken
into camp, 32-0, by the fast Army
eleven, in the second and third periods.

The Virginia team fought pluckily
and held off half a dozen attacks in
the first and final quarters, but the
West Point team was decidedly too
fast and heavy.

Davidson’s two victories, over Elon

and Wofford, and the “moral” victory
over Carolina have shown ‘that the
‘Cats have a team which stands a
good chance of defeating V. M. I.

However, the ’Cats: exhibited a weak
defense against Wofford, and Coaches

“Doc” Newton and “Gene” McEver
are putting special emphasis on this

{part of the game. Several long scrim-
| mages were held during the first part

the winning point as Neal flipped aj is visitor to the Davidson campus,” Of the week, and Coach Newton is

|sradually whipping his squad into
jshape for the coming contest, which

| promises to be a hard one.
|

Soth teams will be able to put prac-
tically their full strength on the field,
jand Saturday should see a mighty bat-
{tle between the two gridiron rivals.
