Court Gossip

+ By A. Goopher Duster.

Check up one big win for the Poison
Squad. Also one heavy loss. That Guil-
ford defeat knocked our championship
dreams popeyed. Our Championship
Special struck an open. switth just when
pilot “Dutch” had ordered “Full Speed
Ahead.”

Our band sent over a barrage of heavy
jazz but it failed to smother the Quak-
crs’ offence. After the game, “I’d Love
to Fall to Sleep and Wake Up in My
Mammy’s Arms” would havé been very
appropriate.

Fifteen for our Fighting Wildkittens!

Quite a few of the “restless six” have
been attending the games and seem to
be unanimous in their verdict that Cap
Pat is the “cutest thing” they have ever
scen. Pat is constructed as heavily as
a box car with a pair of shoulders that
would make Jack Dempsey look like a
living skeleton. And yet the Sweet
Young Things whisper, “Ain't he cute!”

Just a reminder: We play Carolina in
Charlottte soon, maybe. Why can’t we
pull an a la Winston stunt, only more
so?

Do you remember when Carolina came

to Winston last fall when they knew!

they had a deadlock on the Red and
Black? So do we.

Warhoss missed a couple of shots
Saturday night that would have brought
tears to an undertaker’s eyes. But in
spite of that Mauze ‘is still doing the
man o’ war act for Dutch’s Demons.
Wonder how he spends his time when
he is not hanging, up field goals?

The scrappiest five that ever wore the
“D” of Davidson ties up with Wake For-
est here next Monday. Remember that
football game*in Charlotte last fall and
turn out en masse and whoop things up
a bit. ’Nuf ’ced!

Gang, it’s no secret that A. Goopher
has a weak spot in the region of his
pocketbook. Here's one bird of whom
it has never been said, “His bankroll
looks like a piano leg.” “Allee samee”
we believe that our scrappy, hard-work-
ing Poison Squad would appreciate some
recognization for their labors. Fellows,
a two-bit charge for the Wake Forest
game will buy sweaters for them. Let’s
shell out a quarter apiece for the best
basketball team Davidson has ever had.

SOCIETY DEBATE QUERIES.

For February 23, ,1922: “Resolved,
That the United Statesi'should adopt a
policy of prohibiting immigration for a
period of two years.” — ..

For March 2, 1922:.; “Resolved, That
the United States. should maintain a

“avy: equat-to-the targest in the world.”

MARCH 1ST TO WITNESS THE
OPENING OF BALL TOSSING

Baseball practice will begin about
March 1, or as soon after as the weath-
er will permit. So says the “Big Chief,”
Coach Hengeveld. With but three of
‘ast year’s letter men back, competition
bids fair to be strong among ‘contest-
ants for the vacant places. An excel-
lent schedule is being arranged by Man-
ager McGeachy, but is as yet incom-
plete.

With “Southpaw” Sorrells, McPherson,
Alexander and Wright as applicants for
a place on the pitching staff, there is
much promise of success.

Coach Dutch asserts that there is no
need to worry about catchers, for Mc-
Millan is known in athletic circles as
one of the best in the state; also, last
year’s All-State high school catcher,
Hendrix, will be out.

Only one of last year’s infield men is
here this year—Pat Crawford. Accord-
ing to old Taurus, George Neel, Malcolm
Urwin, Mac Richards and Pleasants will
‘ead other contestants for infield posi-
tions a merry chase,

Archie Freeman, captain of this year’s
nine, will be back at his old stand in left
field, with his running mate, Grady
Prown, in right field, leaving the posi-
tion of center field vacant. Dick Rich-
ards and Luke Erwin will no doubt make
other aspirants for this position work
hard.

The schedule for the coming season
has not been thoroughly fixed as yet, but
games have already been arranged as
follows: &

March 24-25—Oak Ridge at Davidson.

March 30—Catawba College at David-
son,

April 1—Trinity at Winston-Salem.

April 8—Wake Forest at Davidson.

April 11—U. N. C. at Chapel Hill, "

April 12—N. C, State at Raleigh.

April 13—Wake Forest at Wake Forest.

April?14—Elon at Elon,

April 21—Furman at Davidson.
April 25—Wofford at Spartanburg.’
April 26—Furman at Greenville.
April 27—Clemson at Clemson.

April 28—N. C. State at Charlotte.

May 3—U. N. C. at Davidson.

A total of 18 games will make up this
season’s complete schedule, thus leaving
four games yet to be arranged for.

WILDCATS WIN AND LOSE IN
TWO LOCAL COURT BATTLES

Guilford Game.

In the most? surprising and gripping
game of the season the unheralded Guil-
tord quintet defeated the Davidson Wild-
cats last Saturday night by a score of
Unfortunately for Davidson the
visitors were playing in excellent form
while the home team was sadly off color.

However, not once did the team give
up hope; not once did they quit scrap-
ping—it was the same old “never say
die” spirit that has always characterized
Davidson’s teams.

Before the Wildcats knew what was
happening Guilford had rung up a lead
of about 8 points. With a rush activi-
ties began and this lead was almost
overcome, but apparently in vain; it was
lost just before the whistle blew for the
end of the first half, the score being
25-14,

Vowing victory the Wildcats returned
for the last frame to demolish the Guil-
fordites. Fighting with every ounce of
reserve strength in their power, it look
ed for a time as if victory indeed would
crown their efforts, but fate had decreed
otherwise and even a scrapping basket-
ball quintet cannot gainsay her decision.
The game ended with victory in the
hands of the visitors 45-26.

45-20.

SPRINGTIME.

This grand Spring weather makes: one
feeltike-casting off old_winter’s togs and
donning those of gayer hue. One feels
like budding out as tihe flowers and
trees. ‘

Then, too, it is only a few more days
until Junior Week. We must have a new
Spring suit for that. Now is the time,
men, and Mellon’s is the place. They
have anything you are looking for. There
you will find the largest assortment of
men’s clothing to be found anywhere in
the Carolinas.. But go early. Get there
before the stock has been picked over.
lf you go this week you will have prac-
tically the entire Spring line to choose
your suit from You know that you want
one and you want it for Junior week.

Now here is the plan. When you go
over to Charlottee for Sousa’s Band Con-
cert, take advantage of the trip. Kill
two birds with one shot; drop in Mel-
lon’s and select that suit then. This
will give the store ample time for any
alterations necessary. Thus you wiil
be sure of getting your suit for Junior
week. Rememlter, the early bird
that catches the worm.—Adyv.

RED AND BLACK FIVE MAKES
INVASION OF S. CAROLINA

Tuesday morning the Wildcat basket-
ball squad left for an invasion of South
Carolina. Only two games were to be
played on the trip as a third game, with
Greenville Y M. C. A,, fell through at
the last minute.

Clemson was the first to be encounter-
ed, the battle at Clemson on the after-
noon of the 2ist, while the schedule pro-
vided for Wofford to be met for the
second time, on the 22d, at Spartanburg

Clemson does not have the team they
had last year when they captured the
South Carolina State championship, but
they can alway$ be counted on for a
good scrap. They got off with a bad
start, but have managed sto turn the
tables in the last several games and are
now hitting a stride which is character-
istic of the Tigers.

The Wofford five during the last two
weeks has been censtantly improving
their game under the superb coaching
of “Ring Major. Their team is built
around R. F. Lindsay, who is a tower of
strength on the offensive. However, the
Wilcats have already tasted the blood of
Wofford once this season and the dope
was that they would duplicate the per-
formance Wednesday night.

The following men made the trip: G.
\W. Mauze, C. R. Crawford, J. P. Price,
M. S. Beall, D. F. Mallory, A. C. Ormond,
and R. E. Boggs.

The prospects are bright for a game
with Carolina in the near future. This
game, although not definitely decided,
will probably be played in Charlotte on
the night of February 28. Final ar-
rangements cannot be perfected until
the Carolina quintet returns from the
Atlanta tournament. When this game
is played it will give everyone the op-
portunity of viewing one of the greatest
inter-collegiate matches of the year.

BRAZIL IS SUBJECT OF
VOLUNTEERS’ DISCUSSION

A short business meeting with discus-
sion of the State Volunteer Conference
at Greensboro early in March and defi-
nite plans for a feed on the 25th occupied
the first part of the Volunteers’ program
last Sunday.

The subject for study was: Brazil in
its relation to our Church work there
Harry Price gave a brief survey of the
population, history, and geography of
this country. He emphasized the pov-
erty and illiteracy of the great mass of
the people, both of which have tended
toward lowered morals. Indeed, it seems
that a large number of the people have
practically no morals at all. Just so
urgently is the Christian religion need-
ed, for along with it come the blessings
of higher morals, education, and a re-
lease from the chains of the poor man
which have so long bound him to a
slave’s life.

Guy Weeks spoke next, touching on
the missionary work among these peo-
ples. He brought out the fact that the
first Protestant workers in this field
were Huguenots sent over by a French
king to prevent their persecution. A
Scotch physician followed them and
from these two races was laid the foun-

dation for all the Brazil work. Pulpit

LITERARY NEWS

EUMENEANS DISCUSS FRANCE
AND THE VERSAILLES PACT

A very interesting program was car-
ried out in the Eumenean Literary So-
ciety ‘Thursday evening. The third term
officers having just been installed, it
was the first meeting under the new
regime. The debate, “Resolved, That
France was justified in holding the Ger-! }
mans to the treaty of Versailles,” was
ably upheld on the affirmative by T. H.
Patterson, John Smith and W. T. Jones.
The negative side of the question was
defended by Elliott, Biddle and Purdy.
Biddle waxed quite oratorical in the
ccurse of-his speech, bringing the hear-
ers time and time again to laughter min-
gled with tears. The judges decided in
favor of the negative but there were
many who believed that in spite of Bid-
dle’s “golden egg speech” the affirma-
tive had the best “line.”

Following the debate and the very en-
tertaining and witty criticism of the
reviewer a masterful declamation was
delivered by Sharpe. This was followed
by an oration on “Memories” by H. M.
Morris.

PANDEINICS CHOOSE MEN TO
SPEAK AT THEIR GRADUATION

The principal features of the Pandeinic
meeting of February 16 were the election
of certain officers and two extemporan-
eous orations.

J. C. Bailey was elected valedictorian
of the society, and G. B. Sorrells re-

‘| spondent, while C. A. Young was elected

sergeant-at-arms. The two extemporan-
eous orations were delivered by J. H.
Grey and G., B. Sorrells. Grey, speaking
on the subject of “The Home Town,” and
Sorrells, on “Five Great Philosophies of
Life,” completely captured the audiences
by their orations.

’ An inclusive paper on Current Events
was presented by D. R. LaFar, and J.
R. Maxwell made his debut by an excel-
lent declamation.

Only two of the debaters, G. B. Rob-
erts and H. B. Price, were present, but
being’ on opposite sides, they discussed
the question, “Resolved, That France has
taken the right attitude towards Ger-
many since the war.”

After the adopting of another article
of the constitution, the meeting was ad-
journed.

BUCK CURRIE TALKS TO

MINISTERIAL BAND

The Ministerial Band met last Sun-
day with a good percentage present.
At this time the band adopted the sys-
tem of voluntary pledging as its finan-
cial basis. In the absence of Dr. Sweets,
of Louisville, who could not attend as
prearranged, A. L. Currie, of the class
of ’21, made a very interesting talk.

Though made on short notice, Buck’s
talk was well arranged and was deliver-
ed forcefully. Before going into the
main part of his talk, he said that no
Davidson man should ever be caught
without something upon whith he could
make a speech. He should at least be
able to speak upon “Davidson Spirit,”
“Davidson’s Greatest Alumnus, Wood-
row Wilson,” and upon present condi-
tions on the campus. Currie chose a
phase of this last subject for his speech,
talking on “Influence.”
