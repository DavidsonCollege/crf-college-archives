The men’s tennis team picked up two big
wins this week, bringing their record to 4-1.

On Thursday afternoon at the Knobloch
campus center, Davidson blanked a strong
Gardner-Webb team, 7-0.

Donald Miles pointed out that “the Gardner-
Webbteam was extremely excited and pumped
up about their chances against us, but we
deflated that enthusiasm quickly by winning
all three doubles matches.”

All three of Davidson’s.teams pulled wins
against Gardner-Webb with one of the matches
coming down to the wire.

Rob Haywood ’04 and Donald Miles ’05
defeated their opponenets 9-7 in the.closest
match of the day.

At number two doubles Rob Gould ’04 and
Jonathan Britt ’04 won easily, 8-1.

Number three doubles also overpowered
Gardner Webb with Geoffrey Mullen ’03 and
Brian Stonestreet ’04 winning 8-2.

In singles, Haywood continued his winning
ways, beating Phil Skelton 6-4, 6-3.

At the second position, Miles played a truly
inspirational match, coming back from 3-6 in

the tiebreaker to win the next five points over
llija Sekulic. Although it took him four match

points in the second set, Miles pulled it out 7-

5:

Regarding his big comeback in the first set,
Miles commented, “Facing three set points, I
buckled down and played conservatively. By
keeping the ball in play, I was able to position
myself to hit winners.”

Atnumber three, Stonestreet triumphed over

Bryan Edmonds 6-0, 6-1 in a relatively short —

match.

Playing against an extremely tall server,
Britt defeated Kern Pal 7-5, 6-3 at number
four.

Britt explained how he was unhappy with
his play in the first set, but, “In the second set,
my game came together and I managed to pull
out a big win.’

At number five, Mullen overwhelmed
Gardner-Webb’s Mike Osbourne 6-1, 6-3 with
powerful groundstrokes and a steady service
game.

Russ Burns ’05 also trounced Daniel Abraho
6-2, 6-1 at the number six spot.

to be a much tougher task, but the Wildcats
pulled out a big win against a surprisingly

Shortstop Dailey and right
fielder Navarro named
preseason All-Conference

By Jerr Davis

D.J. Dailey °03 and Sam Navarro ’05 were
both selected to the preseason All-Conference
team by the coaches of the Southern Confer-
ence,

Dailey, an aggressive shortstop, made the
first team while Navarro, a talented outfielder,
was elected to the second team.

Both had stellar seasons in the field and with
the bat in 2002.

Hitting in the shadow of two of last year’s
seniors, power hitters Tim Frend and James
Marino, allowed Navarro and Dailey to capi-
talize on the good pitches thrown to them.

“Most of the attention was focused on Tim
and James, so when I got to the plate I was
fortunate to get some good pitches to hit,” said
Navarro, who played right field, batted an
impressive .320 and cracked three homeruns,
one being a grand slam against UNC-Greens-
boro.

Starting 46 out of the 50 games, he also had
26 RBI’s and knocked five doubles.

These are imposing stats for a rookie; one
might feel pressured to duplicate or better
these numbers in their second season.

Not Navarro, who prepared himself in the
off-season with intense lifting and participat-
ing in a wooden bat league in the Washington,
D.C. area.

“My teammates and coaches have expecta-
tions for me, as the would any other player, but
I feel I have prepared myself well enough to
meet those expectations,” he said.

“Last year I didn’t really know what to
expect coming in. This year I have a much
better idea.”

Dailey, who is playing his final season for
the Wildcats, was also selected to Baseball
America’s All-Southern Conference first team.

The humble shortstop wasn’t aware of the
honor until his teammates were congratulat-
ing him before practice.

“The guys were congratulating me and I had
no idea what for.

“T later found out I had been selected,” said
Dailey.

Does _ re-
ceiving a pre-
season honor
result in a
greater feeling
of pressure to
perform?

“I don’t
think so,”
noted Dailey.
“T still go into
every game
with the same
approach I
would had I
not been se-
lected. It’s just
an added bo-
nus.”

The short-
stop batted
.314 and led
the team with
4 triples.

He _ pro-
duced 64 hits,
8 doubles and
31 RBI’s.

In the field,
Dailey led the league for shortstops with a
.962 fielding percentage.’

This season, Navarro and Dailey will be the
main concern for opposing pitchers.

“We have been intra-squad scrimmaging
for so long.

“Tt will be nice to get the chance to face a
different opponent,” said Dailey.

That chance was put on hold after the open-
ing three-game home stand with Georgetown
this past weekend was postponed due to rain
and snow.

A makeup date has yet to be determined.

Davidson’s game against the seventh-ranked
Demon Deacons of was also canceled due to
poorconditions at Wildcat Park.

The ’Cats now hopes to begin the 2003
season on Saturday at Wildcat Park, with a
double-header against Mount St. Mary’s be-
ginning at noon.

strong Liberty team.

With the win, Davidson improved their
record to 4-1 while Liberty remained winless.

Stated Stonestreet, “This was the first time
our team had been tested in a close match, and
by prevailing over Liberty we gained more
confidence.in ourselves and each other.”

All three Davidson doubles teams won,
giving the ’Cats the vital doubles point.

Haywood and Miles easily defeated their
Liberty opponents 8-1 at the first doubles
position.

Number two doubles was extremely close
due to the solid serving of both the Davidson
and Liberty teams.

Neither was able to break their opponent,
but Gould and Britt eventually succeeded in a
tiebreaker.

Gould later commented, “Our doubles play
as a team was superior and was a key compo-
nent to us winning the match.”

The number three team of Mullen and
Stonestreet was challenged early in their match,
but they used solid poaching techniques to put
away the match, 8-4.

Atnumber one in singles, Haywood contin-
ued his solid play, defeating Ricardo Shinozaki
6-3, 7-6 (2).

The win brought Haywood’s record to 4-1
this season. :

At the second position, however, Luiz Rino
of Liberty defeated Miles 6-2, 6-2.

Stonestreet remained undefeated for the
season, beating Priit Pihl by a score of 7-5, 7-
6 (9). His record now stands at 5-0.

Stonestreet admitted, “I got a few lucky
breaks, but I was able to hit even groundstrokes
and come to the net on big points.”

The Liberty team took the point at number
four with Braen Anieros defeating Britt 6-1, 6-
2.

Mullen came through in the most important
match of the day, posting a 6-2, 6-1 win over
Kenan Bell.

The win gave Davidson its fourth point of

- the day and sealed the win over Liberty.

At number six, Burns won the first set 6-4,
but lost the second set 6-0 and then lost the
tiebreaker 10-8.

An excited Mullen declared, “Everything
felt right today, and I was just glad that our
team got the win over an underrated Liberty
team.”

The team has a well-deserved week off, and
they will host Richmond at Knobloch tennis
center on Feb. 22.
