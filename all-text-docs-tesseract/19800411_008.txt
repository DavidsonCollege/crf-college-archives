THE BRICK BROTHERS
Another week, another arti-

cle. Yep, you read that in
Bonehead and the Brick Bro-
thers. We are Davidson's an-
swer to sincerity. Hope things
are going well back home. Now
for enlightenment.

We were sitting around under
the apple tree and Bonehead
had some really good dope. He
came up with the idea that
random people are never recog-
nized. You know, we have
convocation where the seniors
dress-up and the juniors get the
awards for academics and ser-
vice, but did you ever think
about all those random people
that you never hear about?
Think about it. Random people
make the world what it is.

After deciding to do this

article on random people, Bone-'

head decided he would do some
research. He went and talked to
Dr. Locke White for six hours
and was able to understand
fifteen seconds of what he said.
Dr. White explained that en-
tropy is a tendency towards
randomness. Entropy is also a
fundamental principle of all

reactions. Do you get the drift?
Random people are everywhere
making random things occur.
‘Where are they,’’ you ask.
Well, they are in random places.
Between your toes, in your
sandwich, in your roommate's
underwear, in Will Terry’s hair;
yes, random people are every-
where. Now is the time for
random people to come out of
the closet. Welcome to the
8B and BB Ten Most Random
People. (The method used to
choose these people was too
random to explain.)

1. DAVID HIPP: David
works at the library desk at 8:27
on Wednesday nights. He was
selected on the basis that he
answered the phone at the
library when we called. We
will make a random guess as to
who David will not take to
Spring Frolics: Debbie Hoover,
Cora Nelson, Mildred Lowry,
Herb Jackson, and David Hipp.

2. MARK DAVIES: Select-
ed from a list of randomly
obscure professors. What else
can you say about a man you
don't know.

The Citadel & UNCC challenges baseball's standing

- By STOKES PEEBLES

Staff Writer
Davidson still leads the
Southern Conference with a 6-2
record (12-11 overall) but sev-
erai key games coming up in the
near future will determine whe-
ther the Wildcats can retain the
top spot. The most critical of
these games is the set that
Davidson will play against The

Citadel on Saturday here.
~The Citadel is tied with
Marshall for second place in the
conference with a 4-2 record,
only one game behind David-
son. Therefore, the emphasis
must be to play well against
The Citadel if the Cats hope to

commented, “We have to take
three out of four from ETSU
and The Citadel to give us a

good shot at the conference .

title.”

However, the Wildcats play a
big game tonight in Charlotte
against inter-Mecklenburg rival
UNCC and some players are
scared that that game might
adversely affect Davidson.
Freshman first-baseman John
Marshall stated, “We're play-
ing well now but I'm scared
about a letdown after the UNCC
game. There's a big pride factor
involved,'’ Marshall added, ‘‘we
do have an advantage over the
other conference teams in et

we've played. eight league
games and the most any other
has played is six. This really
puts the pressure on them to
catch up.”

All of Davidson's games last
week were non-conference con-
tests and the Cats were 2-2

during that period. Norwich

beat Davidson in a closely con-
tested 8-7 loss but Jeff Ray hit
his first home run ever to keep
the Wildcats close. Davidson
then swept two games from
Juniata (Pa.) 6-4 and 9-1 to
once again go above the .500
mark. In the first game John
Porter had 3 RBIs, scored 3
runs, and-had a homer and a
double to lead the ciiee

offense. Diggs Bishop upped his
record to 4-1 with a complete
game victory. In the second
game John Young won his fifth
game of the year by holding
Juniata to one run. John Has-
kell had three hits and a homer
to pace Davidson.

Monday afternoon Davidson
lost 8-4 to North Carolina State
in game in which Davidson had
12 hits but was unable to score
enough runs to beat the Wolf-
pack. Co-captain Joby Merten
had four hits in the game to
pace the Davidson attack.

One of the biggest additions
to the team in the last few
games has been the consistent
hitting of centerfielder John
Portér.. Porter was an all-
conference outfielder last year
and led the team in hitting but
until the Wake Forest game his
average was only .240. Since
then he has been 13 for 19 and
raised his average to .352,
second highest on the team.
John Haskell still leads the Cats
in hitting with a .382 average
and added a home run this week
to up ‘his total to six for the
season. Cam Zurbruegg has a

-317 average to place third on
the team. Pitcher Diggs Bishop
and Jon Young are still leading
the staff and have accounted for
nine of the twelve Wildcat
victories.

This week Davidson plays the
49ers tonight in Charlotte and

The Citadel here on Saturday
afternoon.

out of his nose in a random
fashion. Chosen because Cliff
Tribus thought he was John
Thompson and tried to make
an SAE visitation with him.

4. BOBERT ROWIE: The
fact that Bobert’s name is in the
IMAC article is proof that this
article is completely random.
Bobert's claim to fame is that
he logged more hours in the
library than Leland Park. His
body appears to have been
strung together in a completely
random manner and it is proof
that natural disasters do occur
in a random manner. The
physiology of Davidson’s stu-
dent body was put together in a
random fashion and Bobert
was lucky enough to end up as
the reproductive organ. Guess
who wrote this one!

5. CLIFF TRIBUS: This tall
specimen was just randomly
intercepted on his way to the
library to study. Cliff was so
intent on getting his work done
that he left his attire in his
room. When asked about this
awkward situation, Cliff res-
ponded, ‘‘It ain’t nothing but a
thing.”

6. STORK MCDONALD:
Similar to Cliff in many res-
pects. This loyal fraternity
pledge ran through the library
in a random pattern dragging
an unknown random object
behind him in a surprisingly
happy, random fashion. When

asked about this awkward situ-
ation, Stork responded, ‘‘It
ain’t nothing but a thing.”

7. NICK VIEST: Known to
his few random friends as
“Little Bitty Nick.” Nick's face
is strong testimony that gene-
tics take a random course. A
recent study revealed that Nick
was weaker than 7 out of 10
randomly selected coeds, all of
whom broke dates with him.
Nick will be here for two more
years; then, he will go into the
real world and fail at a radomly
chosen occupation.

8. SARAH MOODY: Our
token random coed..Thank you,
Sarah.

Well, that is all for the Top
Ten in the random world.

Now for the sports.

O.K. guys, who knows what
has been happening in the
IMAC world?. Oops, looks like
this article is already past the
deadline for being turned in to
those people at The Davidson-
ian. Well, old Bonehead better
go turn it in. Next week we will
have our special on intramural
sports. If you really want to
know what is going on in
softball and volleyball, then
write P.O. Box 7, Davidson or
go by and see Thom Cartmill.
Thom seems to have a real
interest in intramurals these
days. Later.
