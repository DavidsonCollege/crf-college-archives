saying that art is something

man does exclusively. @
Our contemporary

awakening to an

un-
derstanding of ‘‘what art e

has led us to see the extent to
which art permeates all of
human life. Thus, in today’s
world, when people endeavor
to make life-styles “‘works of

art’”’ it is difficult in the ex-.

treme to distinguish an “‘art
act” from a “‘social act.’’
What we have understood
traditionally as art is the
presentation of an example,
so-to-speak, of how the human
intuitively and
rationally processes — in-

formation, materials, and sen-~

sation to achieve a desired
end. By isolating art in
‘‘examples,”’ we are
erroneously led to believe that
a work of art is self-sufficient.

However, art is not self-

‘arde Standards

sufficient. Just as a bubble

depends on the air pressure |

within and the pressure
without, art depends on the ac-
tivity of an artist to supply in-
ternal support and the respon-
se evoked by its ‘audience to
supply external support.

Art is relational, therefore
by nature its value is relative.
The value and significance of

all art is determined within its:

relation to an audience.

If anything occurs which
destroys that relationship,
then the work of art itself ef-
fectively is destroyed. “

I believe the increasing

of freedom in the arts

relationship between the
audience and the work.

Human Destruction

sounding title, ‘‘Watership
Down” is indeed. about rab-
bits, complete with long, ears
and powder-puff posteriors.
Yet, it is not in the least
miraculous in the way a fairy-
tale is.

Once our disbelief is initially
suspended, author Adams
takes few liberties with the
credulity of his readers; he
has evidently done a great
deal of research on the
behavior of his subjects in the
wild, and all or nearly all of
the activities ascribed to them
in the novel may be explained
in terms of that behavior.

In other words, these rab-
bits are not “‘brave as lions,”’
nor can they fly like ducks.
They are as timid as the bun-
nies who live in the little patch
of woods behind my house,
and must, like them, trust
mostly to speed of foot for
safety.

But I’m getting ahead of
myself. A simple plot sum-
mary will help explain how
believability is maintained.

This novel tells the story of
a group of young maie wild
rabbits who leave the security
2 a comfortable, established

en in Berkshire to try and
found a new home of their own
on the cold, high plateau
known as Watership.

Adams chronicles the ad-
ventures and discoveries of
their long journey, which in-
clude encounters with~men,
other rabbits, and their own
natures. Yet, superficially at
least, nothing occurs in this
story which could not con-
ceivably happen to.an actual
group of wild rabbits, who
have in fact been known to
wander homelessly after
having been forced to leave
warrens by territorial or

population pressures.

Below this surface,
however, there exist ‘‘as

many different tunnels of -

meaning as one cares to dig,’’.
as a British reviewer has
already noted.

An. example of hidden
meaning may be found in the
reasons why the fictitious rab-
bits leave their original war-
ren. As the'story opens, the
smallest and weakest of the
group, whose name is Fiver,
has had a prophetic dream of
the destruction of the warren
in- which he and his brother,
Hazel, are living.

Together, they go to the
warren’s leaders, who are
larger, older rabbits, in an at-
tempt to convince them of im-
minent danger. They are
dismissed as troublemakers,
and in the end can persuade
only a few others, dissatisfied
by poor living conditions or a
lack of personal prestige, to
depart with them.

Thus, most of Hazel and
Fiver’s followers leave the
first warren for reasons of
their own; the rabbit-seer’s
concern for his fellow crea-
tures- becomes shared only
when they learn, much later,
that all-of his predictions
have been most horribly borne
out at the hands of men.

Much more of a summary
would take a great deal of
pleasure from future readers ;
a simple but intense desire to
find out ‘“‘what happens next’”’
makes this book quick
reading.

‘ Suffice it to say that while
this work speaks of sadness
and its causes, it does not end

sadly; while it deals with the.

capacity of men for evil and
stupidity, its existence as a
work of the human
imagination bears out a belief
that I have long cherished.
That is, that there is hope
for mankind; there is reason

he Joy Of Eating on

By BOB ENWRIGHT
/And MARK YOW

(With profuse apologies to Woody Connette and those who
revered his column, we now endeavor to fill this hallowed space
with a:series of gastronomic misadventures designed to amuse,
confuse, and inform. Bob and Mark)

Last Friday afternoon we were travelling along I-85 towards
Greensboro ostensibly. to see yohn Denver in concert that
evening. Beautiful downtown Davidson’s fuur o'clock mill rush
hour and some heavy highway traffic had us running late. We
arrived about 6:15, picked up a friend from UNC-G, and went
searching for some supper. (Greensboro’s branch of ARA Slater
having been closed for fall break, P.T.L.*)

We soon discovered that Greensboro’s dining population far
outnumbered its restaurants’ capacities. Concert time was
rapidly approaching, and we wére awtully hungry. Finally the
resident Greensboroite suggested we stop and get something
quick and eat after the concert. “I know just the place,” she
said, ‘the Yum-Yum.”’ >

She proceeded to direct us to a small, dilapidated-looking
structure juxtaposed to the UNC-G campus. While in search of a
pare space, she informed us that the Yum-Yum was now
located across the street from its original location of 40-some
years, having been bumped by the construction of a new ad-
ministration building.

Upon our entrance we beheld a sight not dissimilar to our very
own Hub. The major difference between the two was the Yum-
Yum’s menu. It boasted of 27 flavors of homemade ice cream,
one flavor of hot dog, and one flavor of Coca-Cola: After much
deliberation we decided on hot dogs and Cokes all around.

The clientele of the Yum-Yum, apart from the students, con-
sists mainly of past UNC-G graduates who still live in the Green-
sboro area. They seem to gather there and reminisce about the
proverbial good old days at the Women’s College of Greensboro.

One particularly vocal ex-student was bemoaning the fact that
her old dorm now houses male students, or at least she thought

they were. After all, it’s hard to tell at Greensboro. |

The hot. dogs, smothered in trimmings, ‘were rather non-
descript, and the Cokes—well, what can you say? But we still had
a little time, so we decided to sample the ice cream. Our
waitréss, upon learning that we were the pros from Dover, er 2
gourmets from Davidson, informed us that their ice cream was
homemade every morning.

The stuff really puts the Mooresville Creamery to shame. The
pineapple and maple nut would draw five stars from the
Michelin Guide, and our companions informed us of the virtues
of fudge royale and butter pecan. For 20¢ you receive almost a’
