Sox Hop, Guitarist Highlight

Homecoming Next Weekend

By HARRIETT HODGES
Staff Writer

Homecoming Weekend
promises to be filled with ac-
tivities to suit everyone's
tastes, according to Jim Camp-
bell, social chairman.

The festivities will begin at 3
p.m. Friday affernoon with the
soccer game against Belmont
Abbey.

At 8 p.m. in Love Auditorium,
Charlie Byrd, jazz guitarist,
and his band will present a con-
cert.

‘Byrd has been here in the
past and was well received,”
Campbell said. ‘‘His music is
mellow and melodic, and he
plays jazz compositions of
many contemporary songs.”

After the concert, there will
be a Sox Hop in Johnston Gym
at 10 p.m. This will be a 50's
stvle dance featuring Sugar
Creek playing rock and roll
music.

“The dance will be a sox hop
so everyone will have to leave
their shoes outside the gym,”
Campbell said. ‘‘We hope
everyone will put on their bobby
socks and their white socks.”

The Union would give a free
keg of beer to the organization
sponsoring the best dressed 50's
couple.

Also Friday night, there will
be a showing of *‘The Diary of a
Mad Housewife” with Carrie
‘Snodgrass. It will be shown in

....Bblacks Present Grievances

(Continued From p. 1)

“If Davidson cannot make a
real commitment to black
students there is no need for us
to be here,’ said Gibson. ‘‘Some
of our proposals include things
that were promised to us my
freshman vear. but thev have
not been acted on. We are tired
of empty promises. We want ac-
tion."

Gibson said he did not expect
all the proposals to be met
within a month, but he and
other blacks believe the college
can move positively in the
direction of meeting them.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan disputes
Gibson's assertion that nothing
has been done to implement the
10 proposals. He cited the
hiring of a black admissions of-
ficer, the hiring of another
black secretary, and com-
prehensive review of the
library's holdings about blacks.

He also said a report on the
status of blacks at Davidson
was presented to the faculty
this fall, and other action is
being taken to implement the
proposals which were first
presented in April.

Other changes called for by
the BSC include the _in-
corporation of material about
blacks in
especially in sociology.
psychology, economics.
political science, history.
religion, English, humanities
and pre-medicine. Also sought
is a more complete collection of
books and materials in the
library relating to the “black
experience”.

An exchange program with
black colleges is sought, and ac-
cording to the BSC Fisk Univer-
sity, Howard University and
Morehouse College presently
have exchange programs with
predominently white Northern
Colleges.

the curriculum, .

The BSC wants 10 percent of
the coeds to be black. There are
presently no black coeds at
Davidson. Blacks are also
seeking larger facilities to
house the BSC since the number

of black students has increased.
Another proposal is that the

College Union enter into a
cooperative program with area
black colleges to meet the social
needs of black students_
(fore eso

The petition states, ‘The
Coalition believes that these
proposals are realistic and
minimal for a meaningful and
healthy educational experience
at Davidson. We further main-
tain that Davidson College can
show a real and meaningful
committment to the Black
students through these

proposals."*
