Davidson has been installed as a dark horse in the Southern
Conference this season, and if they can get past Dake Friday
night, they are destined for runter-up honors in the fanily
and will be tabbed as the team to dump State's Hoosier Hot
shots if they are to be dumped. Phe Blie Devils have iilso
drawn a dark horse rating and friday night’s tussel has been
nained a toss-up. Coach Gerry Girainl has the same te¥in back
from last year that went to the finals last yer in the con-
ference tournament, Davidson split with the Blue Devils last
season, ed@ine them ina season tussle but bowing in the semi-

final round of the tourney in the Duke gyn.

Phe Durham lads bowed to Hanes in their opener, but have
since posted three straight vietories, On a comparative record
basis this should place the Cats in the favorite’s roll, though
most of the dopesters don’t seem to look at it that way, Dayid-
son faced the mill hands swith two eames under its belt whereas
Duke hit the same team right off Whoever is the favorite,
the tilt should bea gate natural. Student support will be hiek-
ine due to the Christmas holidays.

ltlooks like the students will wet no better than the same

seats in Armory games, Since reserve tickets have been
printed, and many sold, there isn’t much that can be done
even if the powers that be should decide to give the students
u better deal. We hope that this situation will be remedied
We understand that

it willseat nearly two thousand people, We hope the students

with the use of the mew gym next year

will get a good claim on these,

Davidson's Wildcats their first de-
feat of the young season Monday
night in Spartanburg, bowing to an
underdog Wofford crew, 61-53, be-
fore a packed house of 1,500 fans,

The Terriers, led by a pair of
6 foot 4 inch dead-eyes who hit the
mesh for 16 points apiece, took an
early lead and only once in the
second half were the Wildcats able
to move out front.

While the lanky Wally Dean and

Davidson's scoring was led by All-
Southern Center Buddy Cheek with
15 points and forward Mike Wil-
liams, high the squad,
with 10, Cheek fouled out midway

scorer on
the third quarter and his loss was
definitely felt by the Cats.

Wofford hopped to a 4-0 lead at
the outset and by intermission had
run their lead to 33-25. In the third
period, the Davidsonians took a
44-42 lead, but the Terriers pulled
out front again with 12-point
