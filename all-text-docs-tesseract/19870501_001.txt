Vance and Fowler

By DAVID WILLIAMS

The office of citizen “is the
most important public position in
America,” U.S. Senator Wyche
Fowler ’62 said last Friday in an
address at the annual Spring
Awards Convocation, where he
was presented an honorary degree
by the college. “But the office of
citizen is too often taken for
granted, left vacant by apathy, or
filled only halfheartedly ,” he said.

Fowler, a Georgia Democrat
who last November became the
first Davidson alumnus elected to
the Senate, said that only 38 per-
cent of those citizens eligible to
vote went to the polls during the
1986 elections. “By this simplest
means of citizenship, voter turn-
out, we are becoming bystanders
in the governing of our Republic,” .
he said. “This is not the citizen en-
visioned by the Founding Fathers
as they constructed the charter of

zen, a tolerant citizen, and an edu-
cated citizen.” :
Fowler stressed that the survi-
val of American democracy de-
pends directly on “the citizen’s
ability to understand his or her
constitutional rights and duties
and to translate that understanding
into civic activism.” He said
American citizens need to “renew
our sense of community and our
sense of a public life that is much
more than the sum of our private
lives.” He asserted that the Ameri-
can democratic system “will never
be harmed by vigorous disagree-
ment and debate” or by the “in-

. volvement of its citizens,” but that

“it will languish in the presence of
indifference and apathy.”
Regarding the notion of toler-
ance, Fowler noted that the Amer-
ican population “is one of the most
ethnically, racially, and religi-
ously diverse on earth.” He said
that the democratic way of life de-

citizens.”” He noted that children

are “not innately civic-minded or

Observing that the American
Constitution “is a declaration of
the values that bind our 4jversity
into ‘one nation under God,”
Fowler said that “these values
taken together form the image” of
the American citizen. He said,
“That citizen as envisioned by the
framers is above all an active citi-

large numbers of people simply to
be tolerant of others.” He noted
that tolerance is “the core con-
stitutional virtue, because it
makes possible our other civic vir-
tues.”

Fowler said that the role of
education in a democracy should
be “to help gel individuals into

role of education to lead the child
out of himself and into the larger
world.”

Fowler said he would like to
think that “it is more than just a
happy coincidence” that Davidson
College celebrates its 150th birth-
day with the bicentennial of the
Constitution. He said Davidson

foremost.” He added: “Just as the
Constitution embodies our na-
tional ideals and values, so does
Davidson’s educational heritage
embody our deepest beliefs about
ourselves and our world.”

On

foreign policy

By DAVID WILLIAMS
At a luncheon before Convo-
cation last Friday, former Secret-
ary of State Cyrus Vance agreed to
answer questions from, students,
faculty, and alumni concerning
international affairs. fOllowing
are excerpts from his remarks:
On “glasnost” and reform in
the Soviet Union:
Soviet leader Gorbachev has
come to the conclusion that his
country has been slipping for the
last twelve years or so, and that it
can no longer continue as it has or
it will become really a second-rate
world power. Therefore, he feels
that radical reform is necessary
both domestically in terms of the
economy and also in terms of their

international trade.

As a consequence of this, I
think you are going to see a con-
centration on. modernizing the

. Soviet economy. to the extent they

are able to do this. In order to do-
this, I think the Soviet Union
needs a period of relative quiet in
external affairs and therefore I
think that we are going to have a
period during the next several
years ahead where we have more
leverage in international discus-
sions and negotiations than we
have had for twenty or twenty-five
years.

Now, to me this means we
shouldn’t be starry-eyed. It means.
we’ve got to remain strong
