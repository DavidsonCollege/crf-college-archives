FRESHMAN EDITION

Alumni Gymnasium Virtually Clear
For Beginning Of Conversion Job

Conversion work begun this summer on Alumni Gymna-
sium should have the 34-year-old structure readied as a modern
functioning student union in time for the fall term in 1952,
according to Dr. S. R. Spencer. Jr., assistant to the president.

One of the most long-sought
needs on the campus development
program, the student union, will be
housed by the “shell” of Alumni
Gym, the foundation, walls, and
roof being kept intact.

The interior, however, has been
completely cleared away in work
this summer. All inside floors and
partitions have been removed, leav-
ing the infamous Crackerbox. noth.
ing more than one large room, three
stories high. About the only thing
of value to be salvaged from the
interior demolition work, Dr, Spen-
cer said, will be the hardwood floors
from the basketball court, Ini-
provements will, of course, be
made iv the superstructure where
necessary, but there is no large job
there.

Several changes are planned
for the immediate exterior, how-
ever. Where there is.a short
front porch now with a fairly
lengthy tier of steps, the ground
out front will be built up con-
siderably so that only three
or four steps are necessary and
the porch is to be extended be-
yond the pillars some distance
in the direction of Chambers.
To the South side of the build-

ing an area which is part of a
parking lot now will be used as a
terrace, with tables and chairs for
eating and socializing. A large oak
will be left in its present position,
and will serve as a patio center-
piece, Doors to the cafeteria (pres-
ent basement) will be cut in the
South side so that dining may be
done on the patio.

The dining hall, which eventually
will replace that in downstairs
Chambers, will be located in the
southwest corner of the basement
floor with the kitehen and store-
room in the northeast. To the build-
ing’s front on the basement floor
will be a large recreation room
with ping pong, billiards, cards, etc.

The Student Store will be located
between the recreation room and
the cafeteria, ‘generally in the cen-
ter of the basement floor. Future
plans include a bowling alley to

—

run across the front.

Principal room on the main
floor will be the ballroom, lo.
cated in the southeast corner,
generally where the old basket-
ball court was, -but extending
farther to the front of the
building and not all the way to
the north end. To the left, upon
entrance, or in the northwest
corner will be a student lounge.
equipped much in such a way
as the present Y lounge. There
will also be a room for meet-
ings, corresponding to a room
of similar size on the base.
ment floor which will be used
for small banquets and meet-
ing.

Upstairs the upper reaches of the
ballroom consume about one-third
the space with a walk-way around
the edge for those who want to|
watch and talk. The majority or |
the, thied floor will be taken up
with rooms for the various organs
of the student government— The
Quips and Cranks, The Scripts and
Pranks, The Davidsonian, the cam-
pus chaplain’s office, and similar
groups,

Spencer said that the work would
take about nine months, thus as-
suring the student union of a Sep-
tember, 1952, opening date.

Alumni Gymnasiwm was com-
pleted in the winter of 1917.18 and
deemed wholly adequate at the time.
Davidson and basketball grew,
however, and by the late twenties
it was already apparent that the
structure was too small to serve the
needs of the school. To the South-
ern Conference basketball world
Alumni Gym was “The Matchbox”
or “The Crackerbox,” and all big
games, such as those with Duke,
North Carolina, and N. C State,
were moved to Charlotte’s Armory.
Charles Worth Johnston Gym-
nasium, dedicated at Homecoming
in 1949, brought to an end the use-
fullness of Alumni Gym as an
athletic plant. It then figured into
the plans for the student union.

The Military Department welcomes you to Davidson
college. Our unit of the Army Reserve Officers Training
Corps is one of the oldest in the country, having been

established in 1921,

shortly after the ROTC program

was set up by the National Defense Act. In the light of
existing world conditions, the role of the ROTC is even
greater than it has been. Our government feels that the
continuous reinforcement of the Regular Army and the
Organized Reserve Corps with well trained junior officers
from the ROTC is an essential factor in national security.
Young men preparing for a professional or business carcer
need to learn cooperation ‘with others and the intelligent
solution of problems which arise in personal and civil life.

International tensions being

what they are, young men

must also be prepared to serve their country against the
foes of democracy and freedom. To discharge these duties
and responsibilities, it is only fitting that students should
choose to include in their study a carefully designed and
administered program in military science. No matter what
you expect your life's career to be, the ROTC offers fine
training in developing the essential qualities of leadership
required to achieve success in that career. And the very sur-
vival of our nation may depend in large measure upon
those young men of your generation who are capable of
fulfilling posts of leadership and responsibility.

The military personnel on duty here will always be
anxious to help you in any way they can. And they wish
for you every success and happiness in your life as a student

of Davidson College.

JAMES L. BALLARD, JR.
Lieutenant-Colonel, United States Army,
Professor of Military Science and Tactics.
