Movie Review

Dreyfuss
delights
in Opus

By Katie MCALISTER
Staff Writer

I sat in an empty theater this
week, waiting through previews,
and preparing myself foracheesy
flick. Why were the only two
people in the theater me and the
friend that I dragged with me?
We shifted in our seats and ex-
pected the worst. We were both,
however, pleasantly surprised.

Mr. Holland’s Opus is one
of those drag-your-heart-
through-mud-then-mend-it-bet-
ter-than-new kinds of flicks.
There was fury, happiness, hope-
lessness, struggle, and of course,
a tear-jerking finale. Richard
Dreyfuss plays Mr. Holland, a
minor-league musician who
takes a break from the road’ to
settle down with his wife. He
accepts a job as a music teacher
at John F. Kennedy High School,

and soon discovers that teaching
involves more time than he bar-

gained for. He struggles to find
a way to reach his students, and
help them feel the music that
they are playing. His students
learn, with the help of his on-
target leadership, that music is
not about notes on a page. It is
heart and soul, and an able outlet
for pure emotion. He reaches his
students by relating to them and
getting to know them as equals,
not children.

His wife Iris (played by
Glenne Headly) becomes preg-
nant, and delivers ason. Holland
dreams of instilling in his son,
the same passion for music that
he had as a young boy. The son
has a birth defect, and a new
twist enters the movie with sev-
eral intense and heated father/
son conflicts. Holland continues
to teach as well as work on his
life’s goal: an Opus. When fires
are burning at home with the
family, or a student leaves a pro-
found impact on his life, Holland
regresses to his Opus. Thus, the
composition becomes the em-
bodiment of his life, the music of
his trials and tribulations.

The film carries you through
several decades of music classes
and students. Holland finds him-
self an old man, with the battle of
his life at hand. Enter yet another
sub-plot.

Mr. Holland’s Opus was a
one of those amazing roller
coaster rides that throws you
around quite a bit, but still, you
exit (to your right), happy that
you endured it to the end.
Warning: The theater is not to
be held accountable for any tears
shed, or laughter that may escape
your seat.

Black Men Rising

Dinner theater breaks all down to love

By Chad Fogleman
Staff Writer

A Saturday night dinner of Jamaican-style chicken and rice in the
Union’s 900 room merely served to whet our mental appetite for the
entertaining and educational sustenance of Black Man Rising, a
“choreopoem” by James H. Chapman. Lawrence Jenkins, Noel Rogers,
and “Jeffro” Johnson raised their voices in polyphony of speech and song
to create powerful sounds rooted in the gospel of Afro-American

spirituals, contemporary rap, and poets like Langston Hughes and David
of the 23rd Psalm. Even the Miranda rights were sung in a capella
harmony, and the men’s bodies writhed in agony, flipped insanely, and
danced for joy.

Clothed in black with no props save the 900 room bar stools and a
basketball, the three actors used their movements to create scenes of a
child shooting marbles and making snow angels, of urban warfare, of

eating these particular potato chips,
a woman is more likely to get mar-
ried.

Serebrennikov also made a
comparison between advertise-
ments in fashion magazines such
as Glamour, and newspapers such
as The New York Times. She went
on to say that newspapers tend to
reacha more professional and older
audience than fashion magazines,
hence designers advertise more
conservative clothing and use mod-
els with less anorexic or sickly
characteristics.

In general, Serebrennikov dis-
cussed how the fashion industry
uses sex and desire to sell their
products. Many of the ads in-
cluded scantily clad or nude mod-
els. Some used this combination
to such an extent that they did not
even show the product that they
were’ advertising. Dr.
Serebrennikov continued by say-
ing that the image these advertise-

One of the highlights of Na-
tional Eating Disorder Awareness
Week was a speech given by Dr.
Nina Serebrennikov entitled The
Very Skinny Women in the Very
Expensive Clothes: Images of
Women in Advertising. The pur-
pose of this speech was to dis-
mantle fashion magazine ads by
discussing how they cater to and
encourage the proliferation of eat-
ing disorders.

One of the first points that Dr.
Serebrennikov made was that ads
portray married women as thin
women, implying that in order to
get married one needs to acquire
and maintain a slim profile. The
advertisements. that Dr.
Serebrennikov showed were aimed
mainly at the female consumer and
