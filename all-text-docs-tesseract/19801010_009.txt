Cats overcome Bucknell

By VAN BECK

Davidson passed a crucial
test this past Saturday at home
as the Wildcats came from
behind to register a 21-13
victory over Bucknell. The
Bucknell contest was only the
second legitimate test the Cats
have faced this season and a
loss could well have put the lid
on any post-season hopes that
Davidson might be entertain-
ing.

Hopes remain alive and well
however as the Wildcats raised
their record to 3-1 behind the
heroics of Brian Whitmire, Ray

Sinclair and a strong defensive -

effort, not to mention the
second half performance of Gif-
ford Piercy. -

Bucknell jumped out to an
early 13-0 first quarter lead on
touchdown passes of 18 and 16
yards and the Davidson crowd
of 4,300 settled in for a long
afternoon. The Cats bounced
back, however, in the second
quarter on a l-yard quarterback
sneak by Brian Whitmire. After
Gary Sims’ PAT Davidson
trailed 13-7 which is the way
things stood at the half as
neither team mounted a threat
the remainder of the second
period.

Coach Ed Farrell’s staff
zeroed in on several points at
halftime, among them being
that Gifford Piercy would have
the ball thrown in his direction
often in the second half, despite
several un-Piercylike miscues in
the first 30 minutes, and that
the defense would have to come

through in limiting the visiting —

Bison to minimum second-half
point production. The halftime
emphasis became clearly evi-

dent early in the third quarter.
Piercy made two key recep-

tions in the Cats thrid quarter —

drive for the go-ahead score, a
drive culminated by a 9-yard
scoring pass from Whitmire to
halfback Mickey Dillon. The
defense meanwhile was holding
Bucknell scoreless during the
second half. The defense, spear-
headed by co-captain Pat Sheri-
dan and Kevin Hanna limited
the Bison to 66 yards total
offense for the second-half and
holding Ken Jenkins, the Divi-
sion I-AA leader in rushing to
36 yards rushing for the after-
noon. Davidson added an insur-
ance score in the fourth quarter
after Kevin Hanna picked off a
Bison pass. Whitmire snuck in
from one yard out for the score.

Offensive leaders for David-
son included Whitmire, who
scored twice, hit on 14 of 29
passes, Ray Sinclair, who con-
tinues to lead Division I-AA in
rushing after 31 carries for 140
yards; Dillon, who handed in
six passes for 43 yards and
Piercy who ended the day with

four receptions.

An extremely pleased Ed
Farrell commented, ‘Against
Bucknell we had two things
that I have been looking for.
These we must have if we ex-
pect to be a good football team.
The first was good defense
against quality competition.
Bucknell is a good football team
and Ken Jenkins is'a quality
football player. Also, we have
to have consistent offense.
We've been relying too much on
the big. play. But in the second
half against Bucknell we moved
the ball with consistency

against a good defensive team.”

Soccer drops 2 before big ASU match

This week the world turned
upside down for the soccer
team. Three games and one win
later, nothing seemed to have
worked out as it should.

The paradox started last
Wednesday against archrival
The Citadel. The Cat kickers
‘controlled the ball more than
they (The Citadel) did, but
didn’t finish well,’’ commented
a frustrated Coach Charlie
Slagle. In fact, the team passed
the ball better than it had all

John Davis and Randy Mc-
Manus turned in fine perfor-
mances for the Davidson men’s
Cross-country team this week-
end despite the squad’s third-
place finish behind triumphant
Appalachian State and second-
place Furman.

Davis, who finished seventh’
overall in 32:40 on the ASU
home course, and McManus,
who finished eleventh in 33:80,
were followed on the team by
Jeff Morrow (34:12) and Danny
Armistead (35:12). Freshman
Frank Ivey epitomized the
team’s ongoing struggle with
injuries by running two-thirds
of the race with an ankle-sprain
sustained near the two-mile
mark.

The women fared considera-

season, but the kick and run
cadets did something Davidson
didn’t—they put the ball in the
net. Twice. The Wildcats out-
shot the visitors, 20-12, but
could not, convert those shots
to game-winning points.

The laws of compensation
applied Saturday, though, as
the squad squared off against
VMI. The Cats played the
worst game of their still young
season yet squeezed out a 2-1
win. The tables were turned for
the Wildcats as they were
outshot 28-9 by the Keydets,

bly better as first and second
place finishers Tamara Foreman
(19:53 and Marian Hill (20:36)
led the team to a 19-40 defeat of
Appalachian State of their se-
cond win of the season. Merris
Hollingsworth and Carrie Nunn
took fourth and fifth places,
both in 20:53 for the 5000 meter
course.

Both the men’s and women’s
teams are preparing this week
for the annual European-style
Cross-country competition to be
held at Davidson this Saturday.
The 10,000 meter race over
tough obstacles and demanding
terrain will begin at 10:00 a.m.
for the men and at 11:00 a.m.
for the women. The competition
is open, with an entry fee of
$5:00 and a 100-runner limit.
Registration begins at 8:30 a.m.
for unattached runners.

but the goals went in for the
visiting Davidson team. Peter
Burr and Peter Hairston each
had tallies for the Cats, and
Mike Iordanou stopped 50% of
the shots for 14 saves.

Playing games on consecu-
tive days is tough, but Slagle
said, ‘‘anything was an im-
provement over the VMI
game.” Either way, Washing-
ton and Lee was prepared and
psyched-up, and Davidson was
quite ready for the gray skies of
home. The General's right wing
did all the damage in the second
half as the Wildcats fell victim
to the second of two 2-0
shutouts in three games.

This week is being spent in
preparation for Appalachian
State, which steps onto the Cat
homefield Saturday at 2:00.
The workouts began with a
‘uesday night scrimmage a-
gainst Pressbox, a local ama-
teur team. The Pressbox team
won, but many Cat performers,
particularly junior goalie Ior-
danou, played very well.

The Appalachian State
Mountaineers are ranked in the
Top Ten of the nation losing
only to number 2 ranked Ala-’
bama A & M. The Apps boast
Nigerian Thompson Uysian,
whom Slagle considers the best
player in the nation. Uysian has
scored as many goals in one less
game (24 in 8 games) as the
Davidson team has this year,
and so far the red card has been
the only way to stop him. ASU
does play a physical game.

Should the Wildcats win, it
would be the biggest win in
Davidson soccer history. Never
before have the Wildcats played
a Top Ten team, so Slagle and
crew expect ‘‘the hardest game
ever.’’ The Apps have beaten
perennial powerhouse Clemson
3-2, Citadel 8-1 (4 goals in 7
minutes), and VMI 14-0.

With Iordanou back in form
and a pair of down-to-earth
losses, the team is as ready as
possible for ‘‘the biggest game
ever.”’
