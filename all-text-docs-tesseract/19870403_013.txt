College, John Deere to hold combined celebration

By MO ERR

Davidson is not the only well-
known institution observing its
sesquicentennial in 1987. Also
founded in 1837 was Deere &
Company, makers of John Deere
agricultural equiptment.

The college and Deere &
Company plan a joint celebration,
according to Sesquicentennial Co-
ordinator Rupert Barber.

Barber denied accusations that
Deere forced the merger: “By no
means were we bulldozed into this
plan. Our office simply concluded
that sponsoring this event inde-
pendently entailed a long row to
hoe. When Deere combines with
us, power equipment provides just
the spark our celebration needs.”

Activities include a tractor
pull, set for Homecoming
Weekend in the Charlotte Col-
iseum.

“The only event that’s ever
sold out in that arena is a tractor
pull,” Barber said. Stockholders
and alumni will receive priority
seating.

Deere corporate officers and
college administrators will com-
pete in the sport; contestants drive
for the best two out of three pulls.

Currently the college is con-
ducting challenge matches to de-
termine Davidson’s representa-
tives. Barber said, “As in the
America’s Cup trials, athletes
must: qualify by demonstrating
superior ability worthy of the in-
stitution they represent.”

The trial matches have un-
earthed such interest that officials
are now discussing adding tractor-
pulling to the P.E. curriculum.

P.E. Director Sterling Martin
indicated plans to add tractor-pul-
ling to.the list of courses for which
students receive credit. “It’s defi-
nitely a lifetime sport,” he said.

According to Director of the
Physical Plant and facilities Plan-
ning Grover Meetze, Jr., the new
sports complex plans can be ad-
justed to permit installation of a

150-yard mud arena. “Of course,
intramural tractor-pulling will not
use the indoor arena; instead,
those teams will train on the ac-
reage behind Akers, Irwin, and
Knox dormitories,
Forty,” he said.

B. “Kit” Morris confirmed reports
that varsity tractor-pulling could
mean Davidson will enter a new
athletic conference. Other col-
leges observing sesquicentennials
in 1987, including Mount
Holyoke and Guilford, have ex-
pressed interest in forming the
Bush League.

Other departments than the
Athletic Department have ex-
pressed interest in joining the ses-
quicentennial celebration since
Deere’s addition. Religion depart-
ment chairman Samuel Maloney
said, “Sow in righteousness, reap
in mercy.”

The department will host a
spring lecture series featuring
both theologians and fertilizer ex-
perts entitled, “The Seeds That
Fell on Rocky Ground.”

Academic courses offered
during fall term 1987 will cele-
brate the college’s link to Deere &
Company. Registrar Sue Ross
said, “So far, we’ve added a
chemistry course, ‘Combines and
Compounds,’ and renamed the
Humanities program “Plowing
through Plato.”

Vice President for Academic
Affairs, Dean of Faculty and His-
tory professor Robert Williams
noted that the proposed semester
calendar offers a three-week vaca-
tion during harvest season.

The joint celebration opens
frontiers for students interested in
off-campus study in new fields.
Coordinator of Study Abroad
Homer Sutton. said, “We’re thril-
led to expand our existing junior
year abroad program to incorpo-
rate two new locales: JYA
Moline, Il. and JYA Dubuque,
Ta.”

Archivist Chalmers Davidson
cited precedent for the celebration
merger. Davidson said, “After
combing the archives, I’ve disco-
vered the 1837 equipment budget,
which indicates purchase of a
backhoe.” Grounds Supervisor
Irwin Brawley uncovered the
backhoe itself beneath shovels ina
groundskeeping shed; now en-
cased in glass, the hoe will remain
on display throughout the celebra-
tion in the Davidsoniana Room.

History department chairnian
Malcolm Lester said, “It’s no
coincidence that the founder of

Two Johns — Kuykendall and Deere celebrate sesquice ntennials

God gives May ultimatum

By MAY B. EWILL

In a shocking announcement
yesterday, Davidson College Di-
rector of Alumni Relations Jamie
May told a group of stunned re-
porters and college personnel that
unless the Alumni Fund received
donations of $4.5 million before
the end of March that God,
through his agents the Davidson
College Board of Trustees, would
“strike me down.”

“I have given all I have to
Davidson,” May said, “but appar-
ently it just isn’t enough.”

May refused to devulge how
he received word of this threat to
his'life, saying only that it was “a
higher power than John Kuyken-
dall.”

The Davidphonian has learn-
ed, however, that Trustee Howard
Covington delivered the message
to May. In an exclusive interview
with The Davidphonian,
Covington explained how May’s
“quest” is “a solution sent from

Page 1

God to provide the money needed
to expand my golf course to nine
holes.”

Covington explains: “We had
been knocking our heads for long
time when suddenly tongues of
fire swept through the Board
meeting. After awhile the flames
went away. Suddenly we were all
enlightened: let’s pass the buck to
Jamie.”

As word spread across campus
of the grim task appointed to May,
reactions were mixed.

President Kuykendall, visibly
moved at the press conference,
said, “I’ve always though Jamie
was a stand-up guy. I’m going to
do all I can to help him succeed. In
fact I’ve already made out a check
for $20.”

Director of Development
Julius Melton said, “Since we’ve
practically milked the alumni dry
with this Project ’87 stuff, I sim-
ply don’t see how Jamie can pull it

off. Thank God they didn’t give
me the task, or maybe I should say
thank Ralph Holt.”

Board of Trustees Chairman
Ben Craig said, “I’ve always had a
lot of respect for Jamie. Whenever
he has a problem with something
like loud-mouthed students, he al-
ways comes to us. | think God
gave Jamie the task because if
Jamie can’t get money outta
someone, no one can.”

None of the Trustees would
comment on their new role as
spokesmen for God. Some did re-
portedly attend a recent taping of
the PTL club.

When asked whether he
thought he could succeed in his
new-task, May said, “It doesn’t re-
ally matter whether or not I raise
the money as long as I raise the
public consciousness of the need
for more holes on the golf course.
I love Davidson and I don’t mind
being a martyr in this cause.”
