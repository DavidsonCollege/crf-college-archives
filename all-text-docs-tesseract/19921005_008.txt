THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1992

Deep Thoughts:
Baudelaire his “Get Drunk"

I never thought that French
poetry would affect the way I live.
I once had to memorize a poem by
Baudelaire as an assignment. The
poem is titled “Enivrez-vous”
which, literally translated, means
“get drunk.” Far too many of us
take Baudelaire’s apparent advice
entirely too much and too often.
However, it was not necessarily
Baudelaire’s intention that every-
one walk around snockered all the
time. A close examination of the
poem reveals a deeper meaning.

Rather than a rallying call to
step up to the bar, the poem is a
command to drink deeply of life
and the experiences that it offers.
These experiences may, incidently,
include alcohol, for Baudelaire says
“wine, poetry, or virtue, it’s your
choice.” In fact, Baudelaire him-
self probably ingested too much
wine and various other mind-alter-
ing substances. Despite his per-
sonal excesses, his message re-
mains valid: find something that
sparks your interest and immerse
yourself in it. By doing so, he says,
we avoid being martyred by the
oppressive passage of time which
can break you mentally and physi-
cally.

Granted, today we would all
probably tell Baudelaire to lighten

up a bit, I think you can easily
transpose his message to a more
moder format. A modem, not-so-
depressed Baudelaire would want

us to stop spending our lives in
front of the television and to live
actively. He wouldurgeus to avoid
just going through the motions of
everyday living. Rather, weshould
each day robustly suck the marrow
out of every opportunity afforded
us.

We at Davidson Ae

i}

heed this advice especially, since
our backgrounds and our being
here give us a wealth of opportuni-
ties that most do not have. When
we choose the same route as. those
less fortunate by waiving our
chances to explore the myriad av-
enues available at this college, we
are shamefully wasting our lives.

Many among us follow the
easiest road through life, refusing
difficult challenges and thereby
passing uprewarding experiences.
On thiscampus, many ofuschoose
our class schedules according to
some preconceived standard of
difficulty, regardless of our inter-
ests. We avoid too many commit-
ments, orat least those that require
some appreciable amount of effort
on our parts, for they might cut
into the time we en playing
video games in the Union.

As a senior, the reality that we
are only here for four years is rap-
idly beginning to horrify me. Per-
haps we need to know from birth
that we are only here on Earth for
a lifetime. I believe this entails
looking at “Enivrez-vous” less
from a literal standpoint and more

-from the perspective that the poet

himself would have us read it.

I cannot lie. I almost got
caught eyeing expensive, sensual
and very cold lingerie, but I ran
out —_ of

‘The Half Price Sale

it in emergency situations.
“Aaaargh! Where are my
BVD’S?! I need to buff the car!!”

Whereas you

heads and a poor guy who was
obviously tricked into coming into
the store. He was with his wife
and looked as if he wanted to
escape to Radio Shack and play
with the carbon-plutonium radio-
active diodes but was chained toa
series of conversations that kinda
went like this:

WIFE: Do you think this

good on me?

GUY: Uh huh.

WIFE: Or do you think that
the Silk Nightie with the
Indochinese Art would look
better?

‘MAN: UlIrhuh: ‘Uh, honey;
where are the carbon-plutonium
radioactive diodes that you prom-
ised would be here?

The conversation endured
and he kept staring at the floor
trying to nonchalantly deny the
fact that he was actually asked to
feel the new Bohemian Style
Leather Panties. He seemed to be
covering himself with his. Ace
Hardware shopping bags trying
to draw the least amount of atten-
tion as if he was afraid that
Donahue might lurch out from
behind the “Real” Armadillo Skin
Garter Belts.

Women get really excited
about 1/2 price sales at places like
Victoria’s Secret, Thalheimers
and Sears Lingerie Outlet (right
next to the automotive section).
However men don’t really care

we always want it but never have

—

Victoria’s might actually
Secretand to hear “Hey gals,
the safety of there’s a clear-
my really ance sale at
plaid double Victoria’s Se-
insulated cret!” you’ll
flannel shirts ~ never hear. “Hey
at Eddie guys, Jockey
Bauer. Low Cut Briefs
While I sur- are only $4.99 at
veyed Roses! Wanna
Victoria’s carpool?”

Secret, Isaw Another place
many that I am not in-
women clined to enter is
power shop- : ; the GAP. I like
ping at the 1/ : Tony Tunasit the GAP clothes
2 Price Sale, and all but I get
attractive very confused at
mannequins the GAP. There
with no are women inthe

Titanium Lined Brassier will look '

women’s section and there are
women in the men’s section. That
confuses me. And the salespeople
ask me tough questions like: “Do
you need any help?” I don’t feel
like saying something like “Uh,
where do I go?” Actually, I’m
more prepared when I en-
ter the GAP nowadays. Thus our
question and answer sessions go
like this:

GAP: Do you need any help?

ME: (Smiling brightly) Yes,
could you tell me where the men’s
Pique Dyed Chambray Denim
Shirt is?

GAP: We don’ t carry those
anymore.

ME: Oh, well then... (very
suavely now) WHERE DOIGO?

It seems that the only time
that I’m drawn to these two stores
is when I go shopping with
women. That’s why Isay, DON’T
GO SHOPPING WITH THEM!
The next time I go shopping with
Whitney and Margaret, I’m going
to do like my father always did
when he was dragged shopping
by my mom: Find a nice, sturdy,
green bench and curl up and read
through the Wall Street Journal,
Barrons, Sports Illustrated and
War_and Peace. Don’t pretend
that you’re really not at Lerners.
Don’t cooley browse at Benneton
like that size six dress is really
going to match your shoes. And
guys, most of all, don’t get
suckered by the Carbon Pluto-
nium Radioactive Diode bit. It’s
never there.
