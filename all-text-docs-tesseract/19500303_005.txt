Basketeers Close Out Campaign
With One-Sided Win Over Cadets!

By C.D, STRIBLING |

The Wildeats brought their 1950 basketball season to 2
successful conclusion last Saturday night with an overpower-
ing revenge victory over The Citadel. The Cats had been beaten
by this same team in Charleston by a score of 41-34

\7

the “poorest game-of the season”
for the hot and cold hoopsters ac-
cording to Coach Boyd Baird. The
score this time was 87-48 and the
_Cats amply fulfilled Captain Whit
Cobb's chapel prediction that they
would “beat the pants off The
Citadel’. Whit Cobb was the whole
story as he closed out a brillian:
cage career with his most prolific
scoring spree, ending up with a
toial of 22 points. This copped his
previous 20 point effort in the Clem-
son game. So, in a storybook end-
ing, Mr. Cobb finished off four
years of varsity baSketball in a
blaze of glory. He had ample sup.
port for the night from Tommy
Haller with 14, Fred Hengeveid
with 11, and long Bill Brooks witn
8 points. The cagers were hot as
firecrackers in the last game of a
season that has been characterized
by on and off nights. The Kaydets
tried to make a game of it -but
were impotent at their best against
the fast-breaking Cats.

The final record for Davidson
was 10 won and 16 lost. Bill Brooks
stood out in the scoring totals with

290 points for a 11.1 average. Haller
followed with 242 points and a 93
average. The game average for the
squad was 58.7 while the opponen*s
averaged 62.9. All indications point

tea great Seasons ahead for the ame from the Campus Club, 44-21,
young and scrapping Wildcats.

Coach Charlie Parker and Mott Price may well be discussing

the latter’s chances in the Conference Tourney at College Park, Md.,
next week. Mott will wrestle in the 175-pound class for the Cat

grapplers.

Brooks, Haller, Cobb Post Be
Individual Records During Season

By WOODY McKAY

Bill Brooks, Davidson’s sopho-
more scoring ace, closed out his
first season as a varsity player by
topping the scoring list of the Wild-
cat basketballers.

Starting out a chief firebug for
basketball nets of the Wildcats,
Brooks whipped in goal after goa!
to make himself a marked man to
all opponents. Then competing
teams learned his favorite shots
and tried to hold down his basket.
burning techniques, but Bill still
hit the hoops consistently to re-
main among the conference leaders
throughout the season. Three times
he endorsed his membership in the
Charlotte Observer’s “Twenty
Club,” and sizzled in thirty points
against the Hanes Hosiery semi-
pro quintet. All in all, it appears as
if Brooks will continue to be 2
feared man by Southern Conference
mentors for his remaining two
years of college, basketball.

A junior, with only a smathering
of varsity experience under his belt
before the ‘'49-'50 season, ended
in second place on Davidson's scor-
ing charts. Tommy Haller has
proved himself to be a real ball
hawk as well as a scorer this sea-
son, and has been a great asset to
the team. His floor play steadliy
improved through the season, and
he was faking foul shots as well as
opponents as the season closed.

The best description of the
promise this blackhead, hustler has
shown in off-season work would
be found in re-reading the above
two paragraphs, substituting White
for Gregg. The two are that much
alike.

White is probably the -faster of
the two, if not as shifty. But then,
when they can’t see you they can't
hit you. Together with A. C., he
seems to be the boy who'll co.

half, too, but Leach is a senior

years as will Gregg and White.
Stuart, however, is going to be
around for three years.

One of Davidson's all-time greats
is next in line in the point parade.
Captain Whit Cobb finished his
Wildcat basketball career in a blaze
of glory, scoring twenty-two poipts
in his finale against The Citadel and
playing as great or greater than ex-
pectations could call for. A great
team man, Whit was a constant
threat all the time he was on the
basketball floor because of his
sharpshooting ability from near
mid-court and his agility at defen.
sive as well as offensive play. A
type of player which Davidson will
always be proéud to claim, Whit
will remain in the memory of
Davidsonians for years to come,
along with’ such men as Tommy
Peters and Buddy Cheek.

Fred Hengeveld takes the clean-
up spot, and is another man v.ho

These boys should grow and de-
velop with Little's T, or better said,
it should grow and develop witl
them.

By JIM FARRAR
Last Saturday night the North

feated the Wildcat “fishmen” by
the close score of 36-30. The State
team consisted of a combination
of their J..V. and varsity men. Da.
vidson did much hetter up there
than they did against the same team
two wecks ago here, with several
men bettering their times considera-
bly. Curiningham turned in a 1:16.2,
100-yand" breast stroke in the 306-
yard medley relay for his best time
of the year in that event. George
Cornelson also turned in his best
time in the 200-yard_ breaststroke,
with a 2:51.4.

Saturday, the swimming team
meets Clemson here in the last
meet of the year. Monday and Tues.
day following the Clemson meet
the team travels to Chapel Hill to
enter the Southern Conference
there. The team does not expect
o bring home any honors, but is
entering solely for the experience
that the boys will gain, However,
head “fish” Redding is expecting
A-possible place by Miree. and

is due to Coach Redding and his
teanr for the éxcellent work they

are expecting many bigger and bet-
ter things from the team next year.

The results are:
