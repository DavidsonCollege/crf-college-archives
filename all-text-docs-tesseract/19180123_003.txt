The initiation exercise of the Fresh-
men into the Eumenean Society took
place last Saturday night when seven of
the new men lined up with the regular
society. Yet it was not only the prom-
ising graduates of the Fresh Society that
made their debut into the upper society
but also some of the great orators of an-
tiquity. Spartacus of Gladiator fame was
there and told the exact truth about. his
address to the fighters at Capua. Cicero
was there, and told what all he would
do if he were alive and in the Senate to-
day. He showed a marvelous acquaint-
ance with the version of his oration
against Cataline as described by Messrs.
Noble and Noble. Demosthenes appear-
ed and acknowledged that his success in
oratory is due to the famous pebbles, and
as evidence produced some of the peb
bles. Up to a late hour last night the
committee of investigation had not been
able to decide whether it was really a
pebble, or a piece of chewing gum. Mr.
W. J. Bryan came forth in regalin which
undoubtedly showed the effects of grape
juice. Patrick Henry showed the only
correct way to utter the famous words
“Give me liberty or give me death.” J.
R. Woods and Liston also spoke.

Not only was the society graced by
the presence of.the famous orators of the
world, but it also settled for the last
time one of the puzzling questions that
have vexed the wise men of the earth
from the time that the memory of man
runneth not to the contrary. The sub-
ject that the debaters of the Fresh So-
ciety held up for consideration was, “Re-
solved, that the hen that Jays the egg
rather than the hen that hatches it, is the
mother of the chicken.” The affirmative
maintained that as the hen went through
such a sacrific in laying the egg it was
only just that she be given credit for
the performance. The negative on the
other hand contended that the setting
hen is compelled to make a greater sacri-
fice, is compelled to deny herself the
pleasures of the world in order to bring
forth the chicken. The negative con-
tended that while the hen that laid the
egg produced the egg, it was the hen
that hatched it that produced the chick-
en. The negative drew an awe-inspiring
picture of the efforts of a hen to pro-
tect her young, and cited as authority a
wonderful tale of a hen pursuing a man
until he was compelled to take refuge
on the roof of a barn.

The audience listened attentively to
the affirmative, and so decided in favor
of the negative.

Several speeches were ninde welcom-
ing the Freshmen into the society. and
offering them encouragement.

PHI SOCIETY.

The first regular meeting of the
Philanthropic Society, since the holidays.
was held Saturday night, January 19.
The subject for debate was: Resolved.
that the Federal Government should per-
manently own and operate all Interstate

Railroad Systems. The affirmative was
supported by J. W. Clark, Foscu. and
C. Howell, The negative by VW. C.
Cumming and Davis. Several of the
debaters showed a lack of preparation.
Both Clark ind ¢ tmming brought out
several good wats. The majority, of
the judges voted « favor of the negative
side.

Because of the: coldness of the hall
the remainder of the program wis dis-
pensed with.
