The Gullan Administration: in retrospect

Senators praise his “action” and “visibility”; president says he is “weary”

By ApaM Hickey

A year ago, Bill Gullan upset
Alison Sabel in an election that
took many people by surprise. His
victory
showed that
students at
Davidson
were aiming
for change,
action, and a
sense of hu-
mor.

Gullan
will preside
at his last meeting Tuesday, Janu-
ary 30. Reflecting on his term as
president led many Senators to
agree that his term has produced
many positive results.

“The greatest feature of Bill’s
presidency to me has been action,”
says Mary Laura Moretz, a Rusk
Senator. “And he has demanded
the same action-oriented dedica-
tion from the rest of the SGA.”

Perhaps the most action has

arisen from the institution of three
new Student Advisory Councils,
one each to the Directors of Resi-
dence Life, Public Safety, and
Auxiliary Services.
. Before this term, no formal
liaison existed between those three
offices and student government.
By instituting these councils,
Gullan fulfilled one of his cam-
-paign promises.

“The institution of Student
Advisory Committees has been
Bill’s greatest contribution to
Davidson, and it is one we will
truly utilize forever,” says Allison
Sabel, Senior Class Senator.

The SACs were not the only
changes the SGA saw. Gullan pro-
moted several town meetings in an
effort to promote communication
between students, senators, and fac-
ulty on issues such as campus beau-
tification and minors.

Warren Buford, SGA Vice
President, listed a total of 22 sig-
nificant accomplishments of the
Gullan administration. He includes
the fourth copy machine purchased
by the library, the institution of a
recycling program on Patterson
Court, the Davidson City Council-
Mayoral Candidates Forum (held
in October), and reforms at the
Student Health Center.

Most of the other listed ac-
complishments deal with internal
committee reports and proposals.
Several new committees, both ad-
hoc and permanent, were formed.

To examine campus issues,
the SGA created the Beautifica-
tion and Drunk Driving Commit-
tees. To improve SGA-student re-
lations, they created the Commu-
nications and Polling and Response
Committees.

Supporters also congratulate
Gullan and the Senate as a whole
for increasing visibility on cam-
pus. “It doesn’t seem quite so elit-
istand removed from the rest of the
student body,” says Warner Hall
Senator Stephanie Morgan.

In addressing Gullan’s lead-
ership style, many Senators com-
mented on his personality.

Junior Class Senator Saad Gul
comments on his “strong beliefs,”
while Sara Beth Hamlin, another
junior class senator, remarks on
his tendency to be “up front about
his opinions”

Gullan was not without critics
when he began his term. Hamlin
calls herself “initially a bit skepti-
cal of Bill’s leadership techniques.”

Sabel goes so far to say, “When
Bill first took over as President, I
was very worried about student
rights on this campus. His laissez-
faire ruling made it seem as if we
would get nothing done.”

Independent Senator Yanti
Ardie had a “preconceived notion”
of Gullan that was not positive.

All three Senators agreed that
their opinions changed over the
course of the term,

This is not to say that Gullan
remains without critics. Sabel
notes, “We will spend over half an
hour on worthless topics —I mean
worthless in the sense that people
are repeating each other on their
comments.”

Supporters counter that such
freedom to respond in meetings is

necessary. “I would suggest this is
a positive. He wanted as many
people as possible to give com-
ments and encouraged any opin-
ion,” says Buford.

Gullan himself smiled when
discussing critics. He states, “I care
a lot about public support and ac-
ceptance.”

Asked after his penultimate
meeting if he were at all sentimen-
tal, he firmly responds, “No, not at
all.”

“Weary” is the word he uses
to describe himself after a term in
office that he calls “positive” in its
results.

“[I’m not weary of] the Senate
or the people,” he is quick to add,
“but there’s a lot of stuff that goes
along with the job. The commit-
tees, the meetings, and the expec-
tations. People call me if their light
bulb doesn’t work, but it comes
with the territory. I have enjoyed it
immensely.”

Gullan agrees that the SACs
were the most positive reform of
this term, mostly because of the
changes that came from them.
“What they have done-and what
they have the ability to do ... break
with the organizational structure
of the past.”

“I think the SGA did a lot

year will be a positive one. He
says,“I’m really looking forward

‘to it. We have great new leaders
and everyone seems to know each
other really well.”

Chancellor Mike Ingram ex-

plains that the Council plans to .

address and modify the alcohol

‘policy. Ingram recognizes the of-

ficers’ role as a line of communi-

cation between students and school _

officials. “We know that change is
going tohave to happen,” he states,
“We want to make it as easy as
possible.”

more than it ever did in the past. I
think the SGA gained respect in
the eyes of the students, We were
on peoples lips more than ever
before.” But he does not take the
credit. “‘Who’s to say that’s me?
Probably isn’t.”

He was disappointed about the
failure of minors, but states that
the SGA wentthroughall the proper
channels.

From the Council on Aca-

. demic affairs to a town meeting to

the faculty meeting, “That is ex-
actly the way it’s supposed to go,”
he says.

“My accomplishments are
what people agree to, my failures
are what people don’t. ... There’s
no such thing as student govern-
ment. It’s a misnomer. It’s student
advising,” he says, with some irri-
tation.

His greatest frustration has
been that lack of power. —

When he attended a regional
leadership conference, he was sur-
prised at the options available to
other SGAs and their presidents.

“Ican’t say I blame [the Trust-
ees]. It’s their job to change the
policies we want to change. They’ re

willing to listen and ... to act on
what they’re willing to act on.”

Asked what he feels the next’
administration’s most urgent need
is, he paused and stated simply,
“T’djust as soon leave that to them.”

Standing in the doorway -of
the SGA’s office, smoking a ciga-
rette, with his gavel resting on the
desk to his right, Gullan offered
his last words to the student body:
“Place your trust in your leaders,
hold them to a high standard, be
vigilant in making sure they do
their job, because together, we can
move mountains.”
