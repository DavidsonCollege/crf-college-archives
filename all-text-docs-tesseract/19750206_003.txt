The Bavidsonian

By CHUCK HARMON
Associate Editor

“‘A man is never a Christian;

he is only becoming one.’’
--Martin Luther
“There is no such thing as a
Christian college, only Chris-

tiansin college.” .

--Alexander J. McKelway”

“Davidson recognizes God as
the source of all truth. As a.

college committed to the his-
toric Christian faith, it (the col-
lege) sees Jesus Christ as the
central fact in history, giving
purpose, order, and value to the
whole life.”’

Any discussion of Davidson as
a “Christian, church-related’’:
college must, and indeed
always does, begin with these
words from the college’s state-
ment of purpose. But what do
they mean? How does that
amorphous Christian commit-
ment affect the life of the, col-
lege?

Certainly a lot of ink has been’
spilled over this tired issue. But
that is because it is such a
greasy item, perhaps in-
tentionally so, in order that
ithose responsible for its im-
plications might themselves
maintain a rather slippery
posture in regard to its im-
plementation.

Yet surely if the college takes
these words seriously — and any
glance into the massive file of
notes and memoranda on the
subject in recent years will
amply demonstrate that it does-
-somehow you must be affected.

How is it then that this
nebulous concept of a
Christian college determines
who is. here both in terms of
students and staff-and what
goes on during their stay.

How is Christian commit-.
ment to be interpreted? What:
conflicts does it produce, either

potential or real? Finally,
who cares?
Students are by virtue of their

roles, temporary fixtures in
the life of the college. They
come and go with the passage of
time.

But amidst all of this tran-
science the faculty is forever.
Professors loom over the elm
spotted landscape much like the
chambermaids, once | here,.
always. Permanence, security,
tenure, ay, there’s the rub!

Tenure is the magic word and

here lies the focus of the issue of
Christian commitment of an
angle of the faculty.
a is natural ie desirable
that the educational service of a,
church-related college should
be carried forward from one
generation to another by per-
sons committed to the faith of
its founders.”” So reads the
most recent statement of the
Board of Trustees in regard to
the tenure issue.

It goes on to say, ‘The
Christian commitment from the
church related college is reflec-
ted. not only in its corporate
policies, programs, and stewar-
dship of resources, but most
especially in the Christian com-
mitment of the individuals

who make up the communtiy,’

particularly its officers and
tenured faculty members.”’

This is ali well and good, and
in fact the trustees are to be
commended for their proposed
relaxation of the requirement

this repect that, ‘‘in view of the
fact that the Christian com-
munity has always had a place
for the reverent seeker, the
trustees may in special cir-
cumstances grant tenure to a

person who respects the

Christian tradition without
commitment to all its tenets.”’
Yet though this is a welcome
change long hoped for by many
members of the college com-
munity, the trustees refuse to
set quantitative guidelines for
such instances, citing only the

pointment, and stating that
“such cases will necessarily be
rare.”’

The crucial issue in regard to
tenure still seems to be the
basic responsibility the college
has of securing faculty mem-
bers who will strengthen the
college intellectually, morally,
and spiritually.

The trustees’ statement con-:
tinues, ‘‘The president shall be
responsible to the trustees for
being certain that each person
employed as a member of the
Faculty and Staff, at the time of
his or her appointment, is pre-
pared conscientiously to up-

hold and seek to increase its .
effectiveness as a church-
related college.’’

The question which confronts
one in examination of the tenure
issue is whether or not it indeed
facilitates the effectiveness of
the institution as a ‘“‘church- |
related college.”’

The great disadvantage of the
tenure system as everyone is
willing to admit is that here,
like any other place, it has the
tendency to harbor _in-
competence in its officials.

What can be done about the

Faith Without Work ‘

Barfonus Questions Humane Instincts

By R. DAVID KAYLOR
Professor of Religion

“As a college committed to the historic
Christian faith..., Davidson’s primary pur-
pose is to develop persons of humane in-
stincts, of disciplined and creative minds,
and of Christian character for full lives of
leadership, of service, and of self-
fulfillment.”

I have always liked that statement, and
am protid (though not overweeningly so,
mind you!) to be a small part of an in-
stitution with such an_ exalted. ideal:
Therefore, when asked to write an essay on
the meaning of our “Christian com-
mitment,” I was glad to oblige.

Davidson’s Christian commitment -

(Expletive deleted) it! Just when I had
my thoughts all organized, and was on the
verge of writing about our institutional
hopes and goals--about the way we care
about persons, the way we are open to the
truth, the way we are free from any
limitations upon our learning, the way we
are a worshipping community, the way we
choose for faculty members men and
women who are not only competent but also
committed, and other good ideas like those-
-my friend James Barfonus interrupted the
flow of my thoughts with an impertinent
question:

“How can you talk about the Christian
commitment of an institution which ad-
mittedly ‘caters to a group of financially
elite’, whose primary function is to serve as
a staging ground for the offspring of the af-
fluent on their way to greater affluence? I
thought Jesus said something about
ministering to the poor, the outcast, the
ag Do you have any of those around

y ad ; .

Fortunately I looked out the window of | -
‘my carpeted and well-lit office and saw

one of that type walking“across campus;

but unfortunately, just as I pointed him out -
‘to James a security officer pointed him off

the campus. Deprived of my example. of
our Christian concern, I resorted to reason.
“James,” I said, ‘tyou just don’t un-

derstand the practical problems we face in|

deciding how we can best express our com-
mitment. I wish we could do more for the
less fortunate, but I do want a job, and not
only that, I need a more adequate salary.
than I have now.

“The poor can’t support me, where the
financially elite will let some of it trickle
down to me. A college can’t survive as a
social service organization, can it?”’

“And just think of the good I can do,
pricking the consciences of the affluent as
they pass through, prodding them, reluc-
tant though they may be, in a more liberal,
humanitarian direction. Why, one of them
might even be inspired by our Christian in-
fluence to do an expose on slum housing!

“You certainly can’t accuse us of being in
the business for the money; we are not get- -
ting rich while we help dispense the
degrees which become stepping stones on
the way to lives of humanitarian service.

“Even if I can’t afford to minister direc-
tly to the poor, etc., I can help to educate
the future physicians and lawyers who will
sacrificially give their lives to eradicating
the diseases and injustices to which the
poor are subject; and think of the future
businessmen who will be motivated by
their liberal education to give themselves
to raising the standard of living for the
poor, and the future ministers who will
preach from the pulpits of their tall-
steepled churches!

‘‘When we are faced with such limitless
opportunities as that, how could we afford
to exhaust ourselves trying to deal with the
poor?

“Imagine what would happen if in a rash
of do-goodism we started running after the
poor and outcast and neglected our noble
task of training the future leaders of state
and church.

““Think of what might happen to our coun-
try without our graduates in congress, in

ment, and in the decision-making positions
of the churches; why, our political,
economic and religious institutions might
cease having as their primary concern the
well-being of all, including the down-
trodden. Not only that, our college would
not survive.

“It has been stated on good authority that
unless at least 60 percent of our students
come from'homes having above $20,000 in-
comes, we cannot survive. You must not
forget how dependent Davidson College is
upon the present social structure nor must
you forget how the survival of that social
structure and its humanitarian ideals is
Jependent upon colleges like Davidson.

“We have to begin with that fundamental
relationship, and only then can we begin 'to
talk meaningfully about any other im-

plications of Christian commitment.

“Anyway, do you think the poor would
properly appreciate our skills and our lear-
ning? Why throw our pearls before swine?
Besides, we do let a poor guy in once in a
while, and even give hima scholarship if he
shows enough promise of being like us.”’ .

I wasn’t nearly finished with my logical
explanation of the realities confronting a
first-class educational institution with a
Christian commitment when my friend
James Barfonus said ‘‘bullshit’’ and went
out muttering something about ‘faith
without works.’’

Oh, well, good riddance. Now I can get
back to my dissertation on Christian com-
mitment.

One of the primary ways in which the
Christian commitment of Davidson College
expresses itself is in its concern for the

gevernor’s mansions, in the state depart- _

well-being of persons. aus
