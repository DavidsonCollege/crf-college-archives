Cats Dunk Cadets

McConnell was the first to -

Piste to ap feet after classmate, Jamie
Hall put the ball through the net. That
feat in itself is by no means miraculous.
or even noteworthy, except that both se-

niors were playing their last regular sea-_

son home game, .and that Co-captain
Tommy Mac: was finishing his home

season hardly mentioned let alone glori-
fied.

But McConnell was the first one to his
feet from his chair; Rather uncharacter-
istically for a senior co-captain, that is
where Tommy has spent most of his
time this season—watching from a
chair. But he’s had:no problem adjust-
ing to that role, and that’s one of the
keys to this team’s success.

“What I’ve tried to do every single

game is to prepare physically as if I was
"a starter and to prepare mentally as a

‘coach: This way I’m alviiys teady whe-

never I’m called on. Whateveris needed —

of me—whether it’s to play 38 minutes
or one or no ‘minutes—it’s whatever
Tommy Mac has to give.”

This time around’ Coach Hussey
called on Tommy to play 14 minutes,
and Sparky made every one of those
minutes count. Standing just inside the

halfcourt line, Tommy put up an al-

leyoop pass to Jamie Hall. Jamie, back
to the basket,grabbed the pass and
jammed the ball into the hoop for a

small but commanding 2-0 lead. That —

was the first of a team high 5 assists for:
McConnell.

On the other énd of the assist was —

Hall, who likewise has been on the other
end of the leadership. Where Tommy
has led the bench, Jamie has led the
floor.

‘“T’ve taken a lot:of leadership, espe-_

cially on the road. I try to keep them
loose. I just try to give as much leader-
ship as I can. I’m not one who tries to
vocalize the leadership, I just try to dis-
play it.”

There was plenty of leadership in that
behind-the-head dunk. So much, in

fact that the game quickly turned into a

Davidson, dunk exhibition, as the Cats

attempted probably more slam dunks in
a game than in any game in the last dec-
ade and perhaps in school history. All
this came despite the fact that Davidson
didn’t take a 6-point lead until after
14: 30 of play. ‘Such a contest can be dis-

astrous, as Coach Bobby Hussey ex-
“plained. “When you come out,score a

couple of easies, or score on a spectacu-

lar play, it’s probably the worst thing

that could happen to'a team.” He quick-

'’ ly added, “It’s a human tendency—I un-

derstand it,”

But as the co-captains were connect-
ing on alley-oops to. wow the crowd, yet
his, role.
Skip Brown hasn't seen a whole lot of
action, but he’s made his fair share of
commmetion. Says — a

great team man. Skip’s Skip every day.

He probably has the greatest morale of
everybody on the team: He contributes
in intangible ways.”

After Skip stepped on the court Mon-
day night, junior Cliff Tribus said, “Ev-
erything’ s gonna work out if we can get
Skip to score.” Skip scored.

The team showed other signs of im-
provement against the Keydets. Brian
Rowan has established himself'as an in-
side force to be reckoned with, and he
showed it Monday. He hammered in
two: dunks, including a two-handed
stuff off the inbounds pass for four of his
13 points, He hauled in 5 caroms, dished
out 4 assists and was three times a thiof
as well.

Jamie Hall played his ‘best inside
game in recent memory. His last four
