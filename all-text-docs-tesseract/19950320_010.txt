Terrance
Simien
brings his
Cajun
accordion
funk-fest to
campus

By JAMES BERRY

If J was up there dancing
around in my bare feet, singing
fervently in a mix of French
and English (or maybe it was a
really heavy accent), playing
my accordion like there was no
tomorrow, and shaking my
head back and forth in a frenzy
of excitement, J would have
collapsed face down from
dizziness, crushed my accor-
dion, and brought an early end
to the show. Thankfully, it was
Terrance Simien who was
doing all these things at Live
Monday last week — without
the balance problems.

“Tt’s this New Orleans
stuff. I don’t know. It’s
Southern.” That’s pretty much
the best answer I got to the
question “what am I going to
see tonight?” and I don’t
blame anyone who couldn’t
describe the music of the “New
King of the Bayou,” the name I
saw on flyers across campus.
I’m going to try to define it for
the sake of this article, but I
guarantee nothing.

The first clue to the
mystery of this band came
from the source of all knowl-
edge concerning the situation:
the flyer. It said, “zydeco (n).
Music - popular music of
southern Louisiana that
combines French dance
melodies, elements of Carib-
bean music, and the blues,
played by small groups
featuring the guitar, the
accordion, and a washboard.”
That didn’t help me much.
What’s a French dance
melody? The picture that had
formed in my head was of
three older men sitting on
stools and playing their guitar,
accordion, and washboard in a
kind of mellow, courtly French
ballroom kind of way. By the
time I’d made it into the 900
Room, my. mind had flashed
me the equivalent of a sheepish
grin and then concentrated on
the high energy music rolling
out of the PA.

The whole stage was in
constant movement, like a
giant model for high school
chemistry’s explanation of how
gas molecules act. There was
Terrance, shaking his head and
refusing to fall over. Behind
him, the drummer kicked out a
complex beat with no end of
impressive fills, while the

Senior Art Exhibitions:

Wyrick and Love experiment with self portraiture, color shards,

By Mary STEPHENS
Guest Writer

Seniors Chris Wyrick and
Geoff Love commenced this year's
spring exhibitions in the Smith Gal-
lery of the Visual Arts Center with
two shows highlighting their work
while at Davidson. The two week
exhibitions, focusing on each of
the senior studio art majors,’ will
continue through the spring.

The first of these, by Wyrick,
examined.different approaches to
self portraiture. He displayed 42
self portraits and 21 representa-
tions, or totems of other artist’s
self portraits. The driving force
behind his exhibition was to create
acohesive body of work unified by
the format and concept of the self
portraits.

“Self portraiture is such a
strange convention in art. After
taking Shaw Smith’s
postmodernism class, I found my-

self really drawn to trying to un- ©

derstand how the concept could be
more important than the actual art,”
Wyrick says.

The self portraits of other art-
ists, ranging from Albrecht Durer
to Chuck Close to Titian, were
done on slats of wood which hung
on the main wall of the Smith Gal-

lery and were intended to be viewed
or read downward.

Wyrick explains, “I wanted to

try a new format of the visual with’

the totems. The images move
downward, like how a poem is
read. It also has to do with how

computers 'process information.’
..1 copied the portraits freehand
from Xeroxes of reproductions of
the originals to criticize the pri-
macy of reproductions in the study
and enjoyment of the fine arts.”

He cites Miro and Francis
Bacon as two major influences on
his work. Among the artists he
features in the show, Rembrandt
and Kokoschka were important in
his early understanding of self por-
traiture.

Love’s show, which con-
cluded March 18, revealed a more
diverse representation of his work,
consisting of sculptures and paint-
ings. All of his pieces are charac-

terized by the heavy use of color -

shards which tends to echo the pop
artist’s primary color vocabulary.
According to Love, his use of

color is surface and after the fact.

“T want to see what unity will arise
and fling myself out in different
ways. The color surprised me,” he
says.

Love cites Mark Chagall and
Picasso’s late synthetic Cubist pe-
riod as among his influences. He
also notes British sculptor Tony
Cragg and Jacques Lipschitz as

‘sculptors from whom he has drawn

his style. He also mentions Scan-
dinavian design and ornamenta-
tion as an influence. “Eclecticism
is the main unifying factor in my
show. I wanted to do this in keep-
ing with the liberal arts at Davidson
by showing sculpture and different

Sex, murder, treachery, mad-
hess . . . not.a bad way to spend a
Thursday night, right? Bringing
to Davidson College the tragedy of
Macbeth, the Haworth Shakes-
peare Festival created a world of
ambition and desire in which the
line between “foul and fair’’ be-
came confused and at times indis-
tinguishable.

Director Stephen Rayne chose
to set Shakespeare’s play in post-
colonial twentieth century Africa
rather than its traditional medieval
Scotland, for, as he explains, Af-
rica today is “an Eden on the verge
of Apocalypse,” a country divided
by extremes, and the perfect breed-
ing ground for a horrific tragedy to
occur.

As the murderous, tortured
Macbeth, Peter de Jersey brought
both passion and vulnerability to
the role. He fully explored the
"soldier aspect" of the fallen Thane
of Fife, a man so warped by a
culture of violence that he loses
both his mind and his conscience.

Rarely has there been a face
more dark and compelling as when

he turned to the audience with glit-
tering eyes and a seething expres-
sion during Malcolm’s coronation
as Prince of Cumberland. Further-
more, his portrayal of Macbeth’s
madness at the play’s end was rich
and explosive, evoking both pity
and horror from the audience.

You couldn’t ask for a Lady
Macbeth more beautiful and se-
ductive than Bella Enahoro. Her
strong presence and catlike agility
was mesmerizing, while her toned
physique made her a wife worthy
to be reckoned with. It was easy to
see how she controlled Macbeth’s
sexuality and channeled his ambi-
tious impulses. With Peter de Jer-
sey, she had a chemistry which
could be at once playful and then
provocative; the sexual energy was
definitely there.

Her comic choices with the
role were certainly innovative and
entertaining for the audience, yet
ultimately I found that aspect of
her performance alittle unnerving.
To me, Lady Macbeth shouldn’t
be a comic character, ever; and it
weakened her power as the driving
force behind Macbeth’s “sword.”
