FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1954

Tonight Davidson's
cage forces close with
that much talked about
Furman encounter at
Greenville in a game
that will be looked
upon with much in
terest by both Furman
and Davidson fans.
There is more riding
on this game than
meets the eye as it is
almost certain now
that it will be these
teams that will be go-
ing after it at Morgan-
town, West Virginia in
Mountaineer Field
House next Thursday evening at 7:30 p.m. in the Southern
Conference tourney. Another point of interest for Hurricane
fans is the fact that the Cats’ appearance on the Greenville
court will be the home finale for their great All-American
prospect, Frank Selvy.

Coach Miller expressed his satisfaction with his teams’
meeting the Hurricane this close to their meeting at West
Virginia University next week. The Millermen will have a
chance to see the Paladins in action and this may help to im-
prove their showing in the Conference opening round con-
siderably. The way things are shaping up right now it looks
as though it'll be West Virginia versus William and Mary in
the lid-opener Thursday afternoon at 2 p.m., with George
Washington going against VPI at 4 p.m. to complete the after-
noon action. In the first of the night games it'll probably be
Davidson versus Furman at 7:30 p.m., and Richmond going
after VMI at 9:30 p.m.

The Wildcat party will leave Davidson sometime Tuesday
and will take along twelve players in addition to a manager,
Mr. Scott and Coach Miller. The Davidson delegation will stay
at the Fairmont Hotel in Fairmont, West Virginia, some nine-
teen miles from the tournament city. Accommodations for
only the first four seeded teams will be in Morgantown.

Attention Interfraternity Council .....

After talking over the existing situation concerning the
relations between the athletic department and the rest of the
college’s activity program, especially in connection with the
Inter-fraternity Council and the dance schedules, we feel that
some action should be taken to better coordinate these two
vital parts of the college community's life. This situation
especially came to this writer’s attention during this past
weekend when two of the college’s athletic teams were in
competition off campus on Friday night and another played
on Monday night.

Not knowing the situation concerning the signing of big-
name orchestras for the various weekends we hesitate to make
any sort of criticism, however, it seems to us that some sort
of arrangement could and should be worked out so that the
athletic scheduling officials would be able to know far enough
in advance about the dance schedule for the year so as to

"iin Greenville Contest

By JIM HOLSHOUSER
Davidson’s tournament-bound Wildcats hit one of the
toughest teams in the country tonight when they meet Fur-
man University at Greenville, South Carolina. Ranked cur-
rently as the 22nd team in the nation by the Associated Press,

journeys to the Virginia Military
Institute March 5 and 6 for the

Southern Conference tournament.’

This is the last action of a not too
successful year for the grapplers
as the won-lost record goes, and
they face very strong competition
from West Virginia and VMI.

Besides Davidson, W&L, VPI,
and The Citadel will also be rep-
resented. During the regular sea-
son, Coach Parker’s men lost to
VMI, VPI and W&L and beat The
Citadel out of those represented
at VMI. The Cats were also tamed
by State, Duke and Auburn, the
latter two by only two points, tied
a strong Carolina team, and got
a non-conference win over Emory.

Six Entries

The Davigson entries will prob-
ably be Charlie McCrary at 123
Ibs., Captain Johnny Buxton at
147 Ibs., Henry Faison at 157 Ibs.,

year, only two wins and a tie will
probably be much changed next
year. Although the varsity will lose
Charlie Murray, Don Reid, Bill
Coe, and Dave Burns, a very strong
freshman team should fill these
gaps well enough to make things
interesting for the opposition.
Proch Strong

Sonny Kincey, Joe Whitesell,
Tom Firor, Bob Alexander, Ritzel
Snyder, and Ed Grice will be ris-
ing freshmen who had a good sea-
son this year and are ready to do
the same in future seasons. Both
Grice and Snyder came through
undefeated against such compett-
tion as Carolina and State. The
State match was probably the high-
light of the freshman season, as
the perennially tough Wolfpack
was completely swamped.

Next year’s returning varsity
can expect to have a fight to keep

the Independents.

The Sigma Chis established
themselves as top contenders for
the second place slot as they
downed two former second place
clubs, the Pikas and the Kappa
Sigs. The Betas, with only two
games remaining, and the second
place club having lost two already,
are assured of at least a second
place tie.

The league leaders face some
stiff opposition this week, how-

GAME, DANCE TOPS
GRIDDERS’ SPRING
PRACTICE SLATE

Davidson's football Wildcats
completed the second week of
their spring sessions under beau-
tifully clear spring skys this week.
Head football coach Bill Dole ex-
pressed his enthusiasm over the
first two weeks’ of the practice
sessions and as the final week
comes up the Red and Black grid-
ders have shown a lot of spirit
and determination and as_ the
amiable Cat mentor states “have
gotten a lot done.”

The spring workouts will con-
clude with an intersquad clash on
the Richardson Field turf on
March 6. This game will be spon-
sored by the “D” club with 25
cents admission for students and
$0 cents for adults. The public is
invited to attend this prevue of the
1954 Wildcats.

Only One injury

During the first two weeks of
practice only one injury is listed
among the Cat gridders. Bob
Campbell, outstanding frosh end,
sustained a fractured jaw last
week and will be out of the action
for the remaining week of the
workouts.

This Red and Black intrasquad
will highlight the day's activities
with a YMCA-Union dance to cap
off the day in the Union ballroom
in the evening. Students are urged
to bring dates to the game and
remain for the evening dance.

Early Preparations
For Holiday Trip

ATOs have lost 2, the Pikas 3.

This week’s games went as fol-
lows:

Sigma Chi 42 Kappa Sig 39

In an exciting upset thriller the
up and coming Sigma Chis downed
the second place Kappa Sigs 42-
39. Tom Shaw collected 14 for the
winners while Corky Johnson and
Johnny Bremer got 11 each for
the Kappa Sigs.

Betas 62; SAE 38

With Charlie Hasty leading the
way with 18 markers the league
leaders downed the lowly SAEs in
a lopsided runaway. Johnny Me-
Lauchlin was close behind with 17
for the winners, while Steve Nor-
ton had 15 for the SAEs.

INDOOR RUNNERS
IN ACC MEETING
AT CHAPEL HILL

The Davidson indoor track squad
left this afternoon for the annual
Carolina indoor games on the Caro-
lina indoor track over in Chapel
Hill. Coach Whittle took ten men
on the trip, including two fresh-
men. This is the second and last
event of the indoor season.

Last week the Cats took nine
men to the Southern Conference
indoor meet up at VMI and came
home with eight medals, had there
been medals given in the fresh-
man division the team would have
brought back an additional medal
on Pete Ashcraft’s second in the
freshman mile.

Several of the Cat representa-

tives showed up very well in last
week’s meet. Frank Mitchener
placed in the 60-yd. dash and
Phil Koonce finished fourth in the
same event. Bill Shipley placed
third in the 440-yd. dash as did
the relay team in their event.
Homer Sparks finished third in
the strenuous two-mile to round
out the Cat scoring. Overall the
Red and Black clad runners
finished third in the meet.

Swimmers at Va. Tech
For Conference Final

Coach Carroll Hambright’s Wildcat tankmen, fresh from
a convincing victory over Wofford College, journeyed to VPI in
Blacksburg, Va., today for the Southern Conference swim-
ming meet being today and tomorrow.

The Wildecat’s record for all
meets this year is four wins and
five losses. The lone Southern
Conference team which the Cats
have met is the Citadel. In the
two meetings the Cats have taken
one and the Bulldogs have won
one.

VMI looms as the top contender
in the meet. Citadel, VPI and Da-
vidson are the other contenders
for the crown.

event. The finals will be held
on the 11.

the Purple Hurricane has won 22 while losing only 6.

Most of the losses came in early
games, before Darrel Floyd and
Ken Deardorff became eligible for
varsity competition. Since these
two stalwarts joined Lyles Alley’s
crew, the Paladins have been
practically unstoppable.

Top Scorer

The Wildcats will be facing the
nation’s leading scorer, Frank
Selvy, in circumstances which are
not the best. Selvy will be playing
his last game at home, and basket-
ball-crazy Greenville will be
wanting something extra in his
last appearance.

Tomorrow night, Coach Danny
Miller's charges close out their
regular season at Clemson, in a
game which will see the Tigers
rated as slight favorites only be-
cause they are the home club. The
Clemson team has had a poor sea-
son, and an upset could be in the
making. At any rate, it should be
an interesting contest.

Pappy Fowle, who played one
of his finest games against State
finally got the Cats rolling in the
third quarter. Pappy hit three
field goals in less than two min-
utes, after Davidson had gone for
more than 16 straight minutes
without hitting from the field.
Pappy’s sparkling floor work was
the bright spot of the night for
Davidson. He consistently worked
through the backcourt press em-
ployed by the Wolfpack.

Tourney Next

The Southern Conference tourna-
ment is coming up on March 4, 5,
and 6, and it looks like the Cats
have made it. They are holding
down sixth place in the league and
can finish no lower than seventh.

Captain George Crone will miss|mean that VMI moves into the

point man, Al Ormond will carry
most of the individual threats
along with Ed Spier and Bob Aber-
nathy. Jeff Smith, who captured
first place in the Wofford meet
after being absent for several
meets due to illness, will be the
hope for the Cats in the diving.

The Cats took every first place
in the Wofford meet and com-
pletely outclassed the Terriors in
every event, except in the diving
where Smith had tough com-
petition. The Cats will be meeting
tougher competition this weekend,
and the absence of Captain Crone
will be a handicap.
