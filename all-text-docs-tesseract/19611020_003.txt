STRICTLY BIG BUSINESS

DR. PAUL A. MARROTTE, history professor and
soccer coach last year, dropped a line to one of his former
students and players recently. Dr. Marrotte is studying
and teaching at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor
this year and plans to return to Davidson next fall.

We thought you might be interested in some excerpts
from the letter which point out the truly big business
attitude that the large schvols have toward athletics.

“Up here, the stadium seats 101,000 people,
and on a couple of Saturdays this fall, every
seat in the house will be taken. If all goes well,
| hope to see the Duke game next month. The
local schedule is as tough as any in the country,
including Army, Michigan State, Ohio State,
Duke, and Purdue. The home squad numbers

66 players. Last Saturday all 66 played against
UCLA, which does’t happen very often.

“Football is strictly big business here, and
no one pretends ‘t is anything else. Undergrad-
vates number 12,000, and largely think of foot-
ball as most people do watching a TV or pro
game.”

So, from a first hand account, we can see that foot-
ball is just a business at many of the larger schools. It is
not a game to be played and enjoyed, but a means for
making several thousand dollars for the school. The
schools pretend to invest most of the money in scholar-
ships, thus providing 60 “poor” lads with a college edu-
(ation, But how many of those lads really get an educa-
tion? Most of them are in college for one reason—to play
football. So what if they do flunk a couple of courses?
The administration wouldn’t dare flunk a 6-0, 210-lb.
specim/a of manhood who can run 100 yards in less than
10 seconds out of school. The alumni would be on them
like fleas on a dog. Furthermore, the real good players
won’t need a college diploma to play pro ball, the usual
destination of the big stars.

So they use up their three years of eligibility, and
wave goodbye to a school that was never really a school
to them, but an extensive football camp.

Thank goodness we don't have that situation at
Davidson. When a boy accepts a football scholarship (or
any athletic scholarship) to this school, it is with the
understanding that he is going to have to do a lot more
than al play football. He is going to have to study,
robably at the expense of his football game. Certainly

te hours of study never did an atlZete much good.

THE CRYSTAL BALL (.690)

OUR CRYSTAL BALL was extremely truthful last
week (6 1 , and it forecast the Homecoming
game on nose. We now have a fairly respectable
record of 20-9, or a .690 tage. to raise this
latter figure over the .700 mark, we'll p this week-
end’s games as follows:

Davidson entertains VMI in a “must game for

Usher "Dogged” PC With Defense, Toe

If Presbyterian’s outstanding
quarterback, Bobby Joiner, re-
members anything about last
week’s game here at Davidson,
he probably recalls the number
51 more than anything else.

The reason Joiner would re-
member this number is simple—
he saw it in big red letters star-
ing in his face all afternoon. —

Number 51 was Bruce Usher,
our “Wildcat of the Week.”
From his linebacker slot on de-
fense, Usher “red-dogged” the
frustrated Joiner all day and
dropped him for several losses.

In addition to his fine de-
fensive play, the 5-10, 180-Ib.
senior from Bennettsville, S. C.,
booted his seventh extra point
in as many attempts for the
season. Thus he is labeled, “the
most accurate toe in the South-
ern Conference.”

Usher also booted some ex-
cellent kickoffs. On one oc-
casion, his kickoff lofted toward
the PC endzone. The two deep
backs for PC drifted back to re-
ceive it, and crashed together
like two outfielders chasing a

fly ball. Needless to say, this
delighted Wildcat fans.

On another occasion, Usher
kicked off, eluded his would be
blocker, and threw a jarring
tackle on the ball carrier. Most
kickoff artists are satisfied to
let someone else do the tackling
after they make the kick.

Informal Practice

Unofficial practice for David-
son’s wrestlers began last Mon-
day afternoon at 4:00.

Workouts will be generally
light for the first two weeks.
Heavier workouts will begin
after that in preparation for the
first meet on December 1.

Returning lettermen are
Butch LeDoyen, (team captain),
Ben McCoy, Harry Brown, Tom
Wright, Ken Barger, Charles
Trask, Tom Brown, and Jim
Alexander. Sam Glasgow, Billy
Mills, and Russell Walls are
good prospects from last year’s
freshman team.

Also Joe Jones, football half-
back who was ineligible last
year, will add strength to the
team.

Coach Charlie Parker believes
this will be one of the finest
Davidson wrestling teams ever.
