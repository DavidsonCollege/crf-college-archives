Davidson R. O. T. C. Battalion Standing at Retreat, May 5, 1920.
GRAND MAN aboue to lose itself some dozen|time conservative, he was looking

oe ions—Cap yaoi ie
Operati t. i m-
specte, and Awards Honor Flag
to “C” Company.

On Wednesday, May 5, Captain
Cummins, Infantry, P. M. S. and T.
at Clemson, inspected the battalion
to report on Davidson’s qualifica-
tions to be rated as a Distinguished
College by the. War Department.
Captain Cummins is one of the offi-
cers designated to conduct such in-
spections in the Southeastern De-
partment.

In honor of the occasion, and to
supply the necessary time, classes
were suspended for the day. The
morning of the eventful day and the
preceding evening saw such a carni-
val of primping as may go on record
as one of the really busy periods in
the history of Davidsonians. And it
is safe to say that local shine boys
will remember it as a time of all-
pervading opulence, so freety were
dimes dispensed, in a last effort to
make long-neglected “hard boys”
look presentable. The incessant
whine of whisker-removing imple-
ments could but remind one of the
mowing scene in “Snow-Bound”—
“Where merry mowers, hale and
strong, swept, scythe on scythe,
their swaths along the low, green
calleys of the sea,” or something
like that. At any rate, things were so
slick Wednesday morning you could
skate on them.

Since this is military, it had bet-
ter be reported a little military: so
mess was celebrated at the usual
early hour, at 8:30 the bugle corps
sounded the assembly. From that
hour until_past noon things went
rapidly. First a tent camp was
made, and each company duly in-
spected. Then the whole battalion
was put through the various courses,
company by company. Close order,
bayonet, extended order, and physi-
cal training about covers it. It was
then getting about time for noon
mess, so camp was broken, and com-
panies marched to quarters and dis-
missed.

There was time for just a little
smoke and another shine, and the
bugles called another formation. The
inspector wanted to see a little field
work. When the battalion was
formed, Major Hall published a
march order, the substance of which
was that Concord was being over-
tun by Bolsheviki forces, and that
we had been ordered to quiet things
down. “D” Company was desig-
nated to form the advance guard,
and the column moved out, headed
for Concord. Captain Cummins de-
cided that it would not be necessary
to go all the way to Concord, as the
Bolsheviki had probably already
been scared off. So he called off the.
campaign, and sent some of the
Motor Transport folks to stop the
point, which had adopted the motto,
‘Beat Bolsheviks or Bust,” and was

IEUVERS
AND INSPECTION miles ahead. Finally the last of the

party were run down, and the bat-
talion formed again on the main pa-
rade.

During the entire day the com-
petition between the companies had
been running very close, and it was
only a matter for speculation as to
who should emerge victorious. The
battalion was duly presented for pa-
rade, and, in publishing the orders,
the adjutant called the Seniors to
front and center, and “C” Company
to receive the honor flag. The Se-
niors being posted in line with the
staff, Captain McCaskill formed his
company before the reviewing stand
and received the award. The parade
for the Seniors was then ordered.
At the conclusion of the day's
events Captain Cummins addressed
the cadets, congratulating them up-
on their successful work, and ex-
horting them to still better work in
the future. He spoke of the honor
that it is to any college to win the
distinguished rating. The first try
at it might not be successful; but
try again, and keep on trying.

That a good day’s work had been
done was the current opinion, and
that it had been well worth the ef-
fort. There can be no denying that
there was certainly some “putting
out,” if there ever was such a thing.
The result of the inspection will be
known after the board to decide it
has convened at Washington on
une 30, and here is hoping we shoot
em! Whatever the outcome, it is
a sure fact that a good fight was
made for it.

Things look good for next year.
The whole oufit will have become
more seasoned, and there will be
some 50 men back from the camps.
There will also be new equipment,
and more equipment. Our battalion
is going to be harder to beat next
year than ever before.

CAPTAIN MUELLER WILL
NOT RETURN THIS FALL

After 16 months of hard and
faithful service in the establishment
of an R. O. T. C. unit here, the Gov-
ernment has seen fit to place Cap-
tain Mueller elsewhere. He is going
to act as cavalry instructor at a
summer camp in Massachusetts. At
the completion of this camp he is
ordered to report to the Second
Calvary ‘unit at Camp Oglethorpe,
Georgia.

This news came as a shock to both
the colonel and the students. The
order coming in the commencement
season found everyone busy and part
of the students already gone to their
homes, therefore the college will
not be able to give the colonel the
send-off he deserves.

Captain Mueller or Colonel, as he
will always be called by the stu-
dents, was the ideal man for Da-

forward always to the good of Da-
vidson and the betterment of the R.
O. T. C. He was well liked by all
the students and was a brother to
all the members of the faculty. He
was never tired of working, and the
success of the R. O. T. C. this year
was entirely due to his efforts. His
influence in government circles se-
cured the best of equipment for his
men. Even overcoats were issued
when commanders of other units
several grades higher than he had
none. He requisitioned and received
equipment for the good of the stu-
dents that many men would never
have thought of.

Davidson is a school of tradition
and ideals and her policy always had
been non-military. The students had
been allowed freedom from restraint
such as not many do. The colonel
understood the sentiment and did
not throw himself against the wills
of the college men, but went easy
and tried to show them that some
military restraint was a good thing.
He proved this satisfactorily and
had most of the students reconciled
to military rule.

The place of Captain Mueller will
be hard to fill and it is with deep re-
gret that the college sees him go.
While all the students might not like
his course, they are all agreed in
saying he was a real man and the
man for Davidson.

R. O. T. C. WINS HIGHT PLACE _
IN SOUTHEASTERN DIVISION
Stands Eighth Am Twenty-
Seven Leading Southern
Colleges.

Davidson College stood eighth in
the list of colleges in the South-
eastern Division. This was before
the last inspection by Captain Cum-
ming, which was for the Distin-
guished Rating, and the result of
that has not yet been announced.
Considering the fact that 27 of the
best Southern colleges are repre-
sented, eighth place is not at all
bad, and the military department is
to be congratulated upon its good
work.

The following colleges compose
this division :

Alabama—Auburn, Marion Insti-
tute, Spring Hill College, University
of Alabama.

Arkansas—Little Rock College,
Ouachita College, University of Ar-
kansas.

Florida—Stetson University, Uni-
versity of Florida.

Georgia — Emory University,
Georgia Tech, North Georgia Agri-
culture College.

EU SOCIETY REACHED
HIGH WATER MARK
IN ENROLLMENT
This year has certainly marked a
high water point in the history of

the Eumanean Society. Under the
skillful guidance of three of the

ablest presidents she has ever
known; Messrs. Askew, Sullivan,
and McGirt, the Society has in-
creased so greatly both in member-
ship and in efficiency, that the incom-
ing officers are beginning to fear,
like Alexander of old, that there will
be nothing left for them to do.

Beginning the year with a great
burst of enthusiasm, the society
quickly reached an enrollement of a
hundred men, including those in the
Freshman Society. The Freshmen
exhibited such an interest in the
work, and so many of them joined
the Senior Society after Christmas
that it was necessary to divide the
society into two sections, meeting
on two different nights.

The literary part of the work has
been most excellent. There have
been three and sometimes four men
on a side at the regular debates.
Seventeen men entered the decla-
mation contest, and eleven spoke in
the Fresh-Soph Debate prelim-
inaries. The orations have also been
excellent, though many of them
smacked all too strongly of Junior
and Senior speaking efforts.

Finally, the Eumeneans have fur-
nished half of the inter-collegiate
debaters, and have won both the
Fresh-Soph and the Junior-Senior
debates. Also, a Eumenean won the
Junior orator’s medal. Surely this

as been a gala year for the Eumen-
ean!

MAGAZINE SELECTS STAFF
FOR NEXT YEAR

Under the direction of the newly
elected Editor-in-Chief, W. P. Cum-
ming, the next year's staff for the
Davidson College Magazine has al-
ready been selected. As it is both
an honor and a privilege to be on the
staff, and the positions also require
ability and willingness to work, the
Editor-in-Chief took great care in
picking out his men, and the mag-
azine next year gives promise of be-
ing the best. in its history. The
places already filled are, J. R. Boul-
ware, Jr., Assistant Editor; D. L.
Mahood, Exchange Editor; D. R.
Freeman, Poetry Editor; C. J. Mat-
thews, Alumni Editor ; G. H. Cornel-
son, Humorous Editor; W. J. Coop-
er, Fiction Department; A.M. Mit-

chell, Manager; A. C. Ormond and
P. D. Miller, Assistant Managers.
Several Editors will also be added
next fall. From this staff the stu-
dent body should receive an up-to-
date and progressive magazine and
its hearty co-operation should be
given them at all times.

PHI SOCIETY
DOES GOOD WORK

In. Spite of Handicaps. Meetings
Regular and Greater Interest
Shown.

The work of the Phi siciety for
the year has been a steady up-hill
pull. Owing to poor heating facil-
ities, the attendance has been too

ismall for the most good to all con-

cerned, Notwithstanding, in spite
of many handicaps, much has been
accomplished.

Under the leadership of Chalmers,
Calhoun, and Foscue in the order
named, there have been regular
meetings. As a rule, more interest
has been manifest in the orations
and extemporanéous debates, than
in the rugular debates and decla-
mations. Considering the negligence
of the treasurer in collecting the
fines the order has been tinusually
good. But as always there have
been a few who continually took it
upon themselves to “keep up the
Pep.” og: ,;

In spite of inter-society work, the
Phis have put two men on the
debating teams. In its contests with
the old rival sister society, the Eus,
though they have out-numbered,
the Phis have creditably upheld
their part. Chalmers the star of the

Phis, as well as the campus has

alked away with his trophies as
usual.

The society presented diplomas
to the following men: E. N. Book-
er, L. G. Calhoun, D. M. Chalmers,
A. L. Foscue, H. C.. Hamilton, C.
Hunter, W. C. Neel, R. E. McClure,
T. H. Spence, and L. L. Wilson.

With steam heat installed and
such men in charge as C. G. Long,
president, J. H. McKeithen, vice-
president, and J. C. Wool, treasurer,
the society promises to regain its
usual supremacy on the campus, and
accomplish much more honor to
both society and members.

In looking over the staff for the
1920 Quips and Cranks, everything
points to having an excellent An-
nual next year.

A partial list of the staff is as fol-
lows: Long, C. H., Editor-in-Chief ;
McCaskill, C. M., Business Man-
ager ; Literary Department, Walker,
J. R., Gaston, J.M., Beatty, E. A.,
Doubles, M. R., Long, F. V.;
Department, Rogers, R. L., Mce-
Ilwaine, R. R., Buchannan, W. S.,
Sprunt, J., and Bitzer, R. Others
will be appointed after the opening
of college next fall.

The Editor says the Annual will
be out by the middle of April, so the
pictures will all have to be taken in
the fall. The cantracts have al-
ready been made. Owing to the in-
creased cost of printing, the pub-
lication will cost more than it ever
has before.
