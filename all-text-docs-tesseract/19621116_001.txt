ROTC Turkey Shoot
Attracts Marksmen

Scabbard and Blade, the national military fraternity,
‘will sponsor its annual Turkey Shoot on Monday, Nov. 19,
from 4 to 6 p.m. at the rifle range in the sub-basement of

Belk Dormitory.

The families of the college
faculty and administration will
compete by shooting not at tur-
keys but for turkeys and other
prizes. The competition will be
divided into age groups, over-50
‘and under-50 for both men and
women. Childrens’ prizes will
also be awarded.

Regulation targets will be
used for men and women’s un-
-der-50 competition and larger,
oversized targets for over-50)
competition. Each participant
will be allowed five rounds with
a .22 caliber rifle to try his skill
in marksmanship.

The prize for the four men
and women’s competitions in the
shooting contest will be a tur-
key for each of the high scorers
in each group. Besides the free
turkeys, other valuable prizes
donated by Davidson merchants
will also be given. These special
prizes will include two steak
dinners, household articles,
hardware, and many other use-
ful items.

A door prize will be given to
the person who guesses most
correctly the actual weight of a
live turkey which will be on dis-
play at the rifle range.

While the actual contest takes
place, Scabbard and Blade will
serve refreshments to the parti-
cipants and spectators. Movies
will be shown for the children

Chemistry Journal Uses
Paper By Sophomore

Davidsonian Assistant News Editor |
Russell Trimble, a sophomore chemistry major, had his first paper published in
the November, 1962, issue of Analytical Chemistry, a national chemistry magazine.

His article, on pages 1633-35
of the magazine, is entitled
“Comparison of the Reactions of
Amidinourea and Amidino-
thiourea with Various Metal
Ions.” The study compared the
two substances as analytical re-
agents for the identification of
certain metals. The project was
one of original research in an
area almost unexplored before.

Trimble, a member of Sigma
Phi Epsilon social fraternity,
began his project in 1959 and
worked for nearly two years
before finishing it the summer
after high school graduation. He
estimates the work took about
300 to 400 man-hours, “probably
nearer 400,” he commented.
His only remuneration was the
knowledge thus gained from the
research and the recognition for
his paper.

“I made extreme use of equip-
ment beyond the means of ‘pri-

in the MS III classroom while
the competition is in progress.

Competitors from the faculty
and administration may try
their skill in the contest at the
rifle range any time between
4-6 p.m. The awards will be pre-
sented by the Scabbard and
Blade staff at 6 p.m.

Union, Queens Sef
Christmas Party

Approximately 200 Queens
girls are expected to help Dav-
idson celebrate Christmas at the
annual union Christmas party
Dec. 14, following the Davidson-
Furman basketball game.

According to present tentative
plans there will be three bands
engaged for the dance held in
the Morrison Room of the
Union. Other activities include
free billards, ping-pong, jazz,
a poetry reading, a faculty-stud-
ent game contest. and bridge.
Door prizes will be given.

These plans were made Wed-
nesday, Nov. 7, at a meeting of
& subcommittee on Davidson-
Queens activities. The party is
part of an overall effort to
bring the two schools closer to-
gether. Final plans will be made
in a meeting to be held shortly
before Thanksgiving holidays.

He began work which later be-! ’

came the basis on which the
theory which regards nuclei as
tiny particles of very dense
“nuclear fluid” rests.

In 1931 Gamow returned to
the University of Leningrad, |
but in 1934 he took a professor:

ship at George Washington Uni- | #

versity, where he stayed until
1956. There he continued his
work in nuclear physics, es-!

pecially in its application to:

cosmology. and astrophysics.

During the last few years he |

has worked in theoretical bio-
logy, dealing mainly with the
transfer of hereditary informa-
tion in living cells and with the
thermodynamics of photosynthe-
sis.

Gamow has written twenty-
two books and has another one
in preparation. In 1956 he re-
ceived the Kalinga Prize from
UNESCO for the popularization
of science in his books for the
layman. Among his best known
books are One, Two, Three...
Infinity, The Creation of the
Universe, Biography of Physics,
and Biography of the Earth,
which is included in the read-

Clandestine Talents

The Vagabonds are sponsor-
ing an evening of beat poetry
reading, ballad singing, and in-
strumental selections Nov. 28-29
in the Union basement.

The program is open to x
students, faculty members, and
members of the community. In
a DAVIDSONIAN interview, Dr.
Goodykoontz stressed the need
for talent. All guitarists, pian-
ists, singers, mimics, persons
interested in reading poetry,
and those knowing of someone
with talent are urged to contact
the Fine Arts Center as soon as
possible. I

-A rehearsal will be held on
Tuesday before the perform-
ance. Students wishing to pre-
sent their own literary products
are also encouraged to take
part. Each selection should be |
limited to five minutes.

Originally planned for these |
two evenings was a staged read-
ing of a modern play, such as
Eliot's “Cocktail Party,” by the
modern poetry class. Because
this class has been active in past
productions, the plans were
changed to give néw talent a
chance to participate.

No admission will be charged
for the program and tables may
be reserved in advance. Re-
freshments will be served.

He was particularly “grateful
for assistance received from
chemists Doug Sievers and Ken
Fraley for their helpful sugges-

Trimble began this project!
when he found that little work
had been done in this field. In:
his paper he states, “The idea
for this study came from a com-,
ment by (Fritz) Feigl, that the,
sulfur —_ analog, 1-amidino-2-

His first work on this re-

much of his summers on the
project before entering David-

The magazine received _ its
first copy of the article for re-
view on Jan. 12, 1962. Since that
time, several revisions had tak-

Seven Lose Tails To Army;
Fliers Earn Coveted Honor

Davidsonian Assistant News Editor
of seven ROTC MS IV cadets lost their shirt tails recently after logging
their first solo-flight time in the U. S. Army ROTC Flight Training Program.

A group

Each cedet, upon completing
his first solo flight, was reliev-
ed of his shirt tails in the old
tradition of pilots. Captain
Charles C. Partridge, the co-
ordinator of the training pro-
gram, said, “It’s very wise to
wear an old shirt if he (a stud-
ent) thinks he'll solo that day.”

The seven “tail-less” cadets
are Buddy Brauch, Lawrence
Kimbrough, John Thomas,
Marce Pearson, Tommy Tuttle,
Ed Willer, and Russel! Williams.

Each cadet will receive a
total of 35 hours of ground
instruction and 3612 hours of
flight instruction, including
additional solo flights. These
cadets all have over 10 hours
total flight time, with some
as high as 20 hours, and at
least one hour of solo time.

By the end of the program
each cadet will be well on his
way to receive his Federal Avia-
tion Agency private pilot's 1li-

Ten Plan To Attend
Student Legislature

The annual State Student
Legislature will convene in
Raleigh Nov. 29. Among approxi-
mately 10 students represent-
ing Davidson at the three-day
session will be co-chairmen
Hugh Bell and Charles Dibble
along with veterans Bob Cor-
dle and Larry Leafer.

All North Carolina colleges
and universities are invited to
participate in the mock General
Assembly in the Old Legislature
Chambers and may do so after
paying annual dues of $25.
About 25 schools are expected
to take part this year.

The State Student Legista-
ture was organized to provide
a forum for student opinion
and to offer students practi-
cal first-hand experience in
procedures of the state legis-
lature.

Each school presents a bill of
resolution for consideration by
the legislature. Each bill or
resolution is debated before be-
ing voted upon.

Davidson's bill proposes a
Constitutional amendment con-
cerning the length of office and
powers of the Governor of
North Carolina.

Meredith and Wake Forest
will co-sponsor a bill for legal-

ized abortion, while North
Caroline College will seek to
abolish capital punishment.
This semester there have al-

ready been two Interim Coun-
cils of the State Student Legis-
lature, one on Oct. 7 and the
other on Nov. 4.

cense.

Training in the ROTC Flight
Program for the cadets is con-
ducted during open periods in
their academic schedules. The
total time required for the seven
MS IV's to solo was from Oct. 4
to Oct. 28—less than four weeks.

According to Capt. Part-
ridge, this rather quick solo
on the part of all was due to
the interest and ability of the
cadets, excellent instruction,
and fine weather for flying.

The program was started in
September, 1962, with an en-
rollment of six students. Since
that time the number has in-
creased to 10 students.

Joint Musical Venture

The Queens-Davidson Little Symphony, Davidson
College’s newest student organization, will make its bow
to the public in free concerts to be given Nov. 26 and 27.

According to Herb Russell of
Davidson’s Fine Arts Depart-
ment, the group is a kind of re-
organization of the Queens-
Davidson Little Symphony that
disbanded about fifteen years
ago. It is now, for the first time,
organized on a basis of students
from both colleges forming the
major body of the group.

The Symphony is comprised
of the Queens College String
Orchestra under Dr. Robert

Snyder, professor of music at}{

Queens, and sixteen of the first
chair players of the Davidson
College Wind Ensemble under
Dr. Grier Williams, director of
instrumental music at David-

son, Sections have been aug-,;

mented by Davidson townspeo-

ple and advanced high school

instrumentalists.

The Symphony will be heard
at 8:15 p.m., Monday, Nov. 26.
in Ninniss Auditorium
Queens College in Charlotte.
On the following night at the

same time, the concert wil! be}:

repeated in Hodson Hall, Fine
Arts Center at. Davidson. Con-
ducting assignments for the per-
formances will be shared by
Snyder and Williams.

Soloists for the two perform-
ances are Roger Drinkall, ‘cel:
list, and his violinist wife, Derry
Deane. Drinkall is a graduate of
the Curtis Institute and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, while Mrs.

At their meeting Wednesday.
night. the Council named Presi-
dent Danny Carrell and Larry
Leafer to attend the meeting
and to hear what the comntittce
members say about the idea.

“Our plan,” Carrell said, “is
just to discuss the matter with
them, not to present any defin-
ite ideas. Then we (the council)
can talk over their viewpoints
and decide on what to do next.”

The council is trying to get
several changes made in the
traffic regulations. In effect
they are asking that 1) parking
be permitted behind the Fine
Arts Building for permit hold-
ers; 2) more spacc be provided
at the Union for students’ park-
ing; 3) the 45 minute limit on
parking at the Union be raised
or abolished.

Carrell announced that the
Faculty Executive Committee is
considering the matter of late
Teviews. He pointed out in-
stances such as the following
which the committee has taken
up: student's traveling all night
from an interview at a graduate
school to face a review the next
day; three reviews on one day;
“oversleeping” a review. The
council expressed hope that the
committee would make provis-
ions for these recent happenings
not occurring again.

The council was successful in

Delts, Phi Gam
Stall IFC Budget

Holding out approval of the
IFC’s new budget proposal is
the opposition of only two fra-
ternities; Phi Delta’ Theta and
Phi Gamma Delta. The IFC
hopes to achieve unanimous ap-
proval of the plan before imple-
menting it.

A $17,500 annual budget has
been recommended to the Inter-
fraternity Council. The propos-
ed financial plan was formulat-
ed by the Budget Committee
and presented to the IFC by
the committee chairman, Buddy
Cullum.

The recommendations are:
(1) that the IFC operate on a
budget from September through
May.

(2) that this budget be $17,500.

(3) that the cost for each fra-
ternity man will be $23 per
year, to be paid in five equal
payments through the frater-
nity.

(4) that failure to make these
payments will result in being
fined an additional 5% of the
amount due.

(5) that independents may buy -
season tickets for $20.

(6) that a “bumper” fund of
approximately $700 be establish-
ed to be carried from year to
year.

(7) that any money left over
in excess of the bumper fund be
redistributed to the fraternities.

The committee indicated that
a change in the IFC constitu-
tion will be necessitated if the
proposal is adopted, either in
the form of a revision of Article
1X or a completely new article.
The committee plans to present
the revision or new article at
the next IFC meeting.

Dave Olin. a member of the
budget committee, voiced his
approval of the new financial
plan, stating that it would prove
an asset to all concerned, and
would assure the IFC of having
the ability to make payments in
contracting talent for concerts

and dance weekends.
