16 THE DAVIDSONIAN

A few minutes
with the jazz man

~ Terrence
Blanchard

I know that you’ve done a num-
ber of movie soundtracks and
orchestral scores for films. When
Spike Lee asks you to do his
music, what sort of restrictions
are on you versus when you
record an album of your own?

When a director like Spike comes
to me, he’s looking for me to en-
hance his vision in my own style.
He obviously has something in
mind and is looking for arelatively
specific creative thing, but beyond
keeping with the mood or the

storyline, the compositions have _

few restrictions.

You mentioned that your next
album was commissioned by the

Lincoln Center jazz organiza-

tion. I’ve seen discs by Wynton

Marsalis with some sort of “Lin-

coln Center All-Star Big Band,”

but I’ve also heard a magnifi-

cent suite by Roy Hargrove that

he said was commissioned by the

LC. What is it they want you to

‘ do? Do you have restrictions

like with soundtracks?

No, they have asked me to write

some sort of large work. There

aren’t any restrictions. It is my

Own personal creative expression

they are looking for.

I was reading an interview with

John Coltrane shortly before his

death and ‘Trane was asked what
sort of linkage there is between
jazz and politics. He replied that
people are always looking to find
a political message in music and
that sometimes the artist and the
audience get different things out
of the same music. With jazz
having been largely originated
and, to a lesser extent, perpetu-
ated by African-Americans,
what sort of correlation do you
see?

For some, politicization is inevi-
table; politics are a large part of
life. Some musicians are overtly
political, some are .not. As for
racism, it definitely plays a role in
how music is marketed. My music
is based my personal artistic ex-
pression, but that naturally over-
laps with the social condition which
‘means that politics are involved,
but I would say that poltics in most
cases are brought in after the cre-
ation of the music; that is, many
musicians are popular and many
aren’t. Poltical statements sell,
whether they be intensely personal,
something the record company uses
in marketing, or the work of an
angry musician, but it is very diffi-
cult to separate the music from the
world in which we live.

Since the late 60’s, when people
like Albert Ayler, Pharoah Sand-
ers, and Eric Dolphy were doing
th “new thing” in their music,

and in the 70’s when Weather
Report was formed, it seemd that
innovation in jazz has gradually
decreased. With Wynton
Marsalis, Roy Hargrove, and
other young, unabashed jazztra-
ditionalists packing them in and
selling albums, do you think that
conventional jazz now dominates
the scene again?

You're right. There is less “out
there” jazz being produced, or at
least entering the mainstream. The
trend is to go back. It’s kind of a
shame. Jazz is big business now. It
needs to be acceptable to large
numbers of people, you know, mass
marketing, which makes guys like

_ Roy Hargrove even more appeal-:

ing. Ido not agree that the creative
process has in any way slowed
down, though. These just aren’t
the musicians we hear, whereas
avante-garde jazz in the 60’s, when
clubs were king, turned on many
people. It’s just harder to find. The
marketing trend is back to the main-

‘stream.

Whoare some of your influences,
whether it be in writing or on the
trumpet? I’ve read how many
compare you to early 60’s Miles,
but I thought I heard some

Freddie Hubbard and Lee Mor-
gan in your high, driving solos.
Clifford Brown and Miles were
the first two Ilistened to, but you’re
very perceptive. The soloing styles
of Freddie Hubbard and Clark
Terry excited me and made me
reach as high as I could with the
music and as deep as I could with
the composition.

Lastly, nights like this are great
for the future of jazz in America.
I’m sure at least twenty people
walked out of the auditorium
saying, “Gosh that was incred-
ible.” How are we to assure that
jazz catches on on campus?
Other than word of mouth, there
are three structured ways I see jazz
making an impression on young
people. First, we need music ap-
preciation to be included in the
curriculum. That will help expose
people to the music. Second, art-
ists should come in and talk to
students and tell them what in-
spires us, what makes us write and
play the way we do. Third, live
performances like tonight can in-
terest young people in the music.
Thank you for your time and
your wonderful performance
here tonight.

‘A non-Davidson experience”

Ask anyone who was there
what they thought. The several
hundred people who attended
the Terence Blanchard (with his
quartet) performance in Love
Auditorium Saturday night, not
only only witnessed an outstand-
ing performance; but many also
had, as they described it, a “‘non-
Davidson experience.” Of
course Davidson is not the most
cosmopolitan school, but the
two-hour performance had
many bobbing their heads to the
beat, eyes closed, savoring ev-
ery note from Terence
Blanchard’s trumpet. Any jazz
soloist worth his or her salt uses

therhythm section (bass, drums,
and piano) as a springboard to
propel theirsound into the strato-
sphere, reaching other-worldly
dimensions. Any tight rhythm
“section knows how to keep the
soloist from going past the ceil-

ing that is the melodic structure of

the music. The springboard/ceiling -

dichotomy that characterizes an ef-
fective jazz group was present no-
where in my experience more than
on Saturday night. Terence
Blanchard’s solos soared, while the
bass kept time, the drums force-
fully added exclamation points to
Blanchard’s horn (while holding
the group together), and the piano
filled in the gaps of the theme, while
contributing some inventive solo-
ing of his own.: Talented, enthusi-
astic, and inspirational, the quartet
wowed the audience with some
tunes from Blanchard’s most re-
cent album, The Billie Holiday

Songbook, as well as with one stun-
ning selection from his next album,
to be recorded in “several weeks.”

However, Davidson acquitted
itself well. The crowd was large
(with many from The Pines and
Charlotte). I overheard someone

from Charlotte saying how he
had turned down Chapel Hill
basketball tickets for it, and his
friend admitted that, because the
event was on campus, we drew a
larger crowd than would have
probably shown up had the quar-
tet performed at Spirit Square.
Although the acoustics in Love
are terrible and the atmosphere
is decidedly non-jazz, Terence
Blanchard seemed pleased with
the crowd’s exuberant response
to his music.

Arotund fellow witha broad
smile and a deep quiet voice,
Blanchard appeared accessible
and easy to talk to. The arro-
gance and impatience one might
expect from a world-renowned
artist was not apparent in
Blanchard. He conversed with
many of the people who attended
the reception (held afterward in
the Gallery), and was willing to
give me a short interview, the »
text.of which is included.

Ask anyone who was there
what they thought: the several
hundred people who attended the
Terence Blanchard concert. _

Good luck on your exams and final papers from the
Bavidsonian editors.
