Cats fall in fourth quarter to Dartmouth, 24-3

By BRUCE NEWSOME

The Dartmouth Big: Green
broke open a 3-3 game with 21
fourth quarter points to take a 24-
3 victory over Davidson.

The Cat defense kept Davidson
in the game for the first 3 quarters
with big plays. —

Twice in the first quarter, Dart-
mouth appeared ready to score a
touchdown, but the Cat defense
stopped them.

On the Big Green’s first posses-
sion they drove down the field and
had 2nd and goal from the
Davidson 1. Davidson’s goal line
defense held and forced Dart-

Around the H. orn

mouth to settle for a field goal.

Dartmouth drove deep into
Davidson territory again on their
next possession but could not
score.

With 1st and goal from the
Davidson 5-yard line, Dartmouth
looked set to take a 10 point lead.
However, the Dartmouth tailback
fumbled, and Cat cornerback
Mike Noonan recovered for
Davidson.to keep the scoré close.

Unfortunately, for the second
week in a row ‘the offense was
unable to take advantage of the
fine defensive effort. It could
only get 109 yards total offense in

the game.

The rushing game only man- >

aged 63 yards, and the passing
game was even worse.
Davidson’s quarterbacks Peter
Hughes and Nick Crawford com-

bined for only 5 completions in 23

attempts with 2 interceptions.
The Cats’ only points came asa
result of Ralph Isernia’s excellent
punt return in the second quarter.

the score 3-3.

In the third quarter it seemed
that neither team wanted to gain
their first victory of the season.
There were a total of 7 punts in
this quarter and the longest drive
took 6 plays.

The fourth quarter belonged to
Dartmouth. On their first posses-

sion, they connected ona 32-yard ©

In the final 2 minutes of the
game, the Big Green intercepted

fensive back ran it back 36 yards
to the end zone to put the final nail
in the Davidson coffin.

Wildcat basketball coach Bobby Hussey

has a vital interest in the state of Davidson

. athletics, After all, his recruiting, schedul-

ing, and strategy-making are determined
by the general athletic policy.

Although he looks optimistically on this
year’s schedule, he is committed to the
values of conference affiliation.

The automatic bid to the NCAA tourna-
ment, says Hussey, is the biggest motivator
any coach can have. “If you have aconfer-
ence which guarantees automatic qualifi-
cation into the NCAA, that’s a great source
of motivation.”

In.addition “the monetary value is unbe-
lievable,” he says. In particular, confer-
ence affiliation brings revenues from the
NCAA tournament regardless of which
team qualifies. Of course, the qualifier gets
a bigger cut of the revenue, but the rest is
dispersed among conference schools.

‘Hussey is concerned about finding a
conference in Davidson’s geographic area

' for both the fans and the players. “You

develop natural rivals
example, “the Davidson students have had

.” he asserts. For

an avid interest when Marshall came to
town.” — '
Furthermore, Hussey views the advan-

tages of conference affiliation for his liye
ers. “Conference affiliation is great for
team members because they have opportu-
nity to receive awards.”

“The athletes themselves probably miss
most” by not participating in a conference.

Husseyalso worries about the academic
effect of independent status on his players:
He does not like the idea of travelling too
far away for games because the athletes
will miss class and study time.

Looking for a particular: conference,
Hussey believes should involve many fac-
tors.

He views geographic location as the pri-
mary factor to consider. By finding other
schools near Davidson, natural rivalries
will develop that will provoke the emotion
of the student body and fans.

Academic standards are important to

Hussey, but they should not be the determi-

nant. -

“In college athletics, I thing academics .

are extremely important. But when you

‘step on the court, nobody's talking ‘about

SAT scores anymore.”

He looks to schools with high academic |

standards like Duke and Vanderbilt, who
hold their own in very competitive confer-
ences while maintaining their academic

)

integrity.

e However, he insists, “I don’t know that
you have to align’ yourself with elite aca-
demic schools.”

Hussey applauds the NCAA’s new poli-
cies on academics, particularly because
they are bringing the academic standards of
schools closer together.

However, he believes that “there are
going to be some schools that are not nec-

essarily going to be the same.”
Consequently, academic orientation
should not choose a conference, Hussey
asserts,
