Grand slam lifts Wildcats in ninth over Duke

By Rick BENDER
Davidson S.1.D.

Stewart Sloan delivered a one-out grand
slam in the bottom of the ninth inning to give
Davidson (22-18) a 7-6 victory over the vis-
iting Duke Blue Devils (13-27).

The win gives the Wildcats a sweep over
Duke this season, having defeated the Blue
Devils Feb. 16 in an-
other one-run contest,

got the baserunners it needed. Senior pinch-
hitter Eric Bowers started the rally, drawing
a lead-off walk from Duke’s sixth pitcher of
the day, Kevin Perry. Ryan Stroker followed
that with a four-pitch walk to bring the tying
run to the plate. Perry gathered himself to
strike out Jack Purcell, but after throwing a
ball to Tim Frend, he was replaced with Ryan
Caradonna.

Caradonna (4-6) fell behind 2-1 in the
count to Frend before leaving a change-up up
in the zone, which Frend smoked into left for
a base hit to load the bases. With the count
even at two balls and two strikes, Sloaned
fouled off a change-up low and away to stay
alive. Then, he jumped on a fastball for his
game-winning homer, his sixth of the year.

The grand slam made a winner out of
pitcher Matt Hood (2-1), who did not give up
ahit over the final 2-2/3 innings. The Davidson
bullpen was also a hero, as Hood and Nate
Ramirez allowed just one hit and noruns over
6-2/3 innings.

The men’s tennis team found victory this
weekend in the Knobloch Tennis Center over
the Fightin’ Christians of Elon, which came
in boasting a 12-2 record,

The Wildcats began the day with some
extremely close doubles matches. Playing
the No. | spot, Brett Ialacci and Alex Olulski
lost an extremely close match 8-4.

“We were right there, so close to the top,
and then we let up,” said Ialacci.

At the No. 2 spot, Whit Hansen and
newcomer Jakub Sramek, who was filling in
for the injured Billy Boykin, posted a win
over an extremely tough team and played
surprising well together.

“Jakub and I play much better as a team
than me and Billy,” said Hansen after the
match.

career-high with
five hits, includ-
-ing two .doubles
and a three-run
homer, and seven RBI's in a 15-14 win
over Winthrop on April 6.

At the No. 3 spot, Chris Herrington and
David Webb fought back from a huge deficit
to beat Elon’s duo of Mark Woodforde and
Todd Woodbridge, 9-7.

“We were down two breaks early, but we
kept playing tennis,” a relieved Webb com-
mented after thé match.

“We decided to switch sides today. I
made the call right before the match started,
which startled David a little bit,” said
Herrington.

The pair did look a little disjointed, espe-
cially after they went down 3-0 early. After
some big backhand returns, forehand vol-
leys, and big serves by Herrington and a
strong lunging volley from Webb, thetwo put
together an intimidating attack.
