Alexander Wins In New Election

. By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

In an unprecedented sec-
ond election for SGA vice-
president, Bill Alexander
pulled a slim majority to
defeat Bob Edmunds after
losing to his opponent by
only 8 votes in the first
round, :

The new election is a first
in recent campus elections,
and came in response to a
student petition questioning
“election procedure irregu-
larities” at
weeks ago. Alexander won
this time, capturing 54% of
the ballots and leading
Edmunds by a margin of
51 votes.

“I’m glad I -won,” Alex-
ander said. ‘‘The_ election
was run very well; it ‘was

tight, but I don't see how
anyone could have any com-

plaints. I hope’ future elec-

the polls two~

tions will be of the same

calibre.”

As president of the Resid-
ence Hall Council (RHC),
Alexander wants to keep
the organization ‘‘a separ-
ate entity from the SGA for
the time being because the
president of the senate
would have too much power.”

He believes that dividing
the power in the senate is a

‘good idea now, and that the

RHC can work efficiently.
He pointed to the work of
former SGA _ vice-president
Cecil Burney, who raised
over $1500 for the RHC last
year.

Alexander added, ‘I want
the representatives in each
individual dorm to be able
to take care of the problem
there. If they have trouble

. with anything, then the RHC

can take on the matter, and
if we can’t handle it, then

For Coming Years

According to College Pre-
sident Samuel R. Spencer,
_there is little chance that
Davidson will institute co-
education on a large scale in
the near future.

In a_ recent »« interview,
Spencer said that the pro-
posal concerning co-educa-
tion, which was approved

with THE DAVIDSONIAN

last year by the college
trustees, ‘‘is in a wait-and-

see period.

“With the economic down-
turn, all colleges have be-
come more cautious about
decisions involving a large
capital investment,” Spen-
cer explained. ‘‘People are
feeling economically uneasy,”
making any consideration
for immediate co-education
on a large scale unrealistic.

The proposal approved, by
the trustees last year stated
that ‘‘the trustees will con-
sider admission of women
student as degree candidates
at such time as this is judg-
ed by the Board to be eco-
nomically and educationally
feasible.”

According to Spencer, most
trustees felt that this was
an approval in principle of
co-education.

w~ we'll go to the senate.”

Alexander thinks there is
a possibility that the trustees
» may: change their minds on
the fraternity situation, and

..he wants ‘to work to make

the court into a. coexistent
structure with national frat-
grnities and eating clubs.

“If . the trustees don't
change their position, I want
to do the most I can to eli-
minate the coerciveness of
this system so that it will
not hurt anyone that does
not participate, especially in
terms of money.” :

Among other things Alex-
ander favors the
counq@il proposed by SGA
President Danny Clodfelter,
optional final exams, and the
withdrawal of the SGA from
the -National Student Assoc-
iation (NSA).

On the NSA, Alexander
said: ‘‘Their name and what
they stand for would be de-
trimental to Davidson Col-
lege, and we can obtain any
service it offers without be-
ing in it. This organization
has acquired a debt. of $400,-
000, and there: is nothing in
their constitution which says
that our college does not
have to incur part of that
debt.”

In the senatorial elections,
the following were elected:
Class of '72, Cecil Burney,

Mark Meza, and - Bill Lear ~

(president); Class of ‘73,
Doug Sittler, Ralph Peeples,
and Mike Creasman (presi-
dent); Class of '74, Calvin
Allen, Doug Brown, and Bill
Ralston (president).

David Jones won the elec-
tion for Defense Advisor.

Elections this year show-
ed a general upsurge of
political activity from Da-
vidson's own silent majori-
ty. Around 700 votes were
cast on first ballots both
weeks, and more than 300
students turned out for the
run-offs, which is the usual
number for the first ballot
in past elections.

Candidates for the offices
also swelled in number com-
pared to previous years. In
the senatorial race alone the
least number of contenders

in any class was: eleven. A
real possibility existed that
there would have to be two
run-off elections.

Although a variety of is-

sues stirred opinion during

the. election, voters seemed
to choose the winner regard-
less of positions one way or
the other on the fraternity

Open Dorms

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Assistant Managing @ditor

In its final actlon under
out-going Chairman Cec |}.
Burney, the Residence Hall
Council has voted to declare
the dorms at Davidson open
24 hours a day to guests of
Davidson students,

The action was agreed up-
on last year, but there has

<been no announcement  un-

until now to allow the RHC
time to see how open dorms
worked unofficially.
In-coming freshmen were
told by hall counselors that
the dorms were as ‘good as
open,” so the action pro-
bably surprises very few.
This is the first time the
RHC has gone on record as
declaring open dorms at all
times. In the past the coun-
cil has favored action to al-
low totally open dorms,. but
never. has it openly declar-.

y day.

will not he prosecuted.

When asked if he expect
ed any repercussions from
the decision, Burney had no
comment, but he -did say
that what has been. done is
what the RHC considers best
for the situation,

“We've removed hy po-
crisy and have begun to he
more honest and realistic
about ‘the  situation,’’ Bur-
ney told THE DAVID-
SONIAN,

When contacted by THE
DAVIDSONIAN, Dean of
Students Will Terry said he
felt the Student Life Com-
mittee would have to be re-
sponsible for prosecution of
cases of dorm hour viola-
tions.

“I’m always disappointed
when students are unwilling
to assume this kind of re-
sponsibility for the conduct
of their own affairs, .

“It makes it doubly diffi-
cult when the Dean of Stu-
dents has no desire to be a
policeman,” Terry told THE
“As far as
T interpret it, the hours re-
main in force.”

In other action at its meet-
ing last Thursday, the RHC
approved a grant of about
$100 for the distribution next
fall of a ‘‘survival kit” on
alcohol, drugs, and sex to
all students, and spent $360
for a color TV for: Richard-
son Dorm to replace the
black and white TV now in
that dorm. |

The RHC also allotted
$67.50. to sponsor a film with

ment in an effort to show
