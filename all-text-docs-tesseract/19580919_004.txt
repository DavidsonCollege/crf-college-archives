Martin Interview [Construction Work On
(Continued From reo (Campus Nearing End

Work on the new library wing, fraternity court, and
post office is nearing completion. The remodeling of the

library, which is scheduled to be completed on Sep-
tember 29, has greatly altered the floor plan of the build-
ing. The front lobby can now be entered only through
the center doors, and it is dominated by a large, semi-
circular main desk. Reserve books will be stored in an

seeking to strengthen depart-.

alcove behind the main desk.

The card catalogue will be
behind the main desk, and the
office of the Circulation and
Reference Librarian will! be lo-
cated on the left of the lobby.

The most important change is
the addition of three new floors
of stacks in the new wing. This
brings the total book capacity
of the library to 200,000 vol-
umes. The new wing also con-
tains several offices and enough
carrels to bring the total num-
ber to 107.

Final construction connected
with the new post office will
be the laying of a new side-
walk. Following the policies of
modern landscape design, the
new walk will not be laid until
the student body has worn out

be the most convenient route
to the new building.
