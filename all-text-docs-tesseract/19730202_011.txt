Cat Club Gridders Schedule
Three NCCFA Spring Games

By CHARLIE SLAGLE
Staff Writer

After a successful first fall
season, Davidson's club football
team will resume play this
spring.

Bob Wetzel and_ Eric
Scharling, acting as_ player
representatives attended a
North Carolina Club Football
Association director's meeting
at Duke last Sunday.

Attending this meeting were
representatives of all the other
schools in the association, in-
cluding Central Piedmont.

Duke, East Carolina, North
Carolina) and North Carolina
State.

At this meeting the spring
schedule was planned and
Davidson has three games ten-
tatively scheduled. The first
will take place April 14 against
Central Piedmont.

On April 21 the gridders will
play Duke at Myrtle Beach.
This game at Myrtle Beach is
part of a charity affair in which
all the teams of the conference
will participate. The other
games being played are Central
Piedmont - N.C. State and East
Carolina - North Carolina.

The last game scheduled for
the spring will be against
Methodist which is just starting
aclub.

The Duke game at Myrtle
Beach is the only game where a
definite site has been deter-
mined. Sites for the other two

games will have to be decided .

by Davidson's club officials and
their opponents.

Another important aspect of
the director's meeting con-
cerned Davidson -directly. A
change in rules. now will allow
more Davidson students to play
club football.

The old rule stated that no
person could play club football
if they at any time received a
scholarship to play football or

competed in varsity com-
petition with or without a
scholarship.

Because of Davidson's small
enrollment, this rule has been
changed in Davidson's case to
read that students are not
eligible to play if they have ever
competed on the varsity level in

we call them) are led by the
shooting of Jim McNair and the
skyrocket rebounding of Tom
(the Moose) Soos. Their finest
hour was a clutch 30-27 win over

’ afine Grey House team.

Right behind the SS and
hanging tough is PDT #3.
Sparked by Mike Ernst and
Bick Halligan. the Delts should
give the SS a run for the top
berth.

Tied for second with the Delts
is that powerhouse freshman
combine, Sentelle #3. In their
contest with the ATO’s the frosh
showed a lot of class when they
recovered from quite a shock--
the ATO's showed up--to win 49-
11. It was a moral victory for
the ATO’s, however, as they got
into double figures.

Back in the third position are
the campus elite, better known
as Grey House. After losing that
squeaker to the SS, the elite
bounced back to rout Watts B
66-25.

W-1B has followed W-1A’'s fine
example of wimpiness with
their only victory being a sound
thrashing of ATO, 1-0. by for-
feit.

Also in third is Fanny and
Mavel's No. 2 team. F&M #2
had a unique experience last
week when team leader Dave
Griffiths scored 16 points in
their game with (who else?) W-
1B. It seems Grif scored 12 for
F&M #2 and 4 for W-1B. W-1B
had a player injured and took
Grif so that the game could con-
tinue.

football.

This change in. rules now
allows any Davidson student
who came to school with a foot-
ball scholarship but did not con-
tinue on to play varsity football
to play on the club team.

The rule change was not
needed earlier because David-
son’s club was a first year
member and the no-scholarship
requirement is waived for all
new members of the Association.

Moving to Division II, the
uncontested leader is McCann,
who stand alone at 4-0. Mc-
Cann’s leading scorers are Jack
Fletcher and ( You guessed it! )
McCann. They definitely are

the team to beat in Division
Il.

There's a three-way tie for
second between F&M #2, the
Cannoneers, and PKA #2.
Emanon #2 knocked the Can-
noneers from the undefeated
ranks Monday in a_ 50-49
squeaker.

The Cannoneers rely on the
outside shooting of John Cren-
shaw, while Emanon #2 feature
a balanced attack.

PKA #2 kept pace after a
close shave with the last-place
Lakers. The Lakers, smelling
an upset, were thwarted in the
last seconds by a 50 (?) ft. jum-
per by Ford Newman which
gave the Pika's the 36-35 vic-
tory.

Two other teams of interestin .

Division II are Bruno's Bunch
and Gunner Joe. Bruno's Bunch
is coached by our favorite wop,
Mike Sorrentino. Their record
stands at a dismal 1-3. and
there is talk of changing the
name to Powell's Powerhouse.
Gunner Jones is the only team
in the league to have co-eds on
the roster. GJ is also 1-3 and un-
fortunately, their No. 1 girl,
Katie Early, leaves for Africa
next week to train with the
