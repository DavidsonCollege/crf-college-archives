Expert Analyzes
Saucer Sighting

An expert in the field of
unidentified flying objects
presented and evaluated in-
‘formation concerning ‘fying
saucers” and showed a 30-
second film clip of one of
these sightings in chapel
Tuesday.

“These {lying saucers.”
commented James Moseley.
editor of a UFO publication
called Saucer News, “go
back as far as the Bible.”

Moseley cited numerous
examples of sightings, which
may have occurred as long
as 2300 years ago.

These sightings. he said.
varied in credibility. They
have been particularly nu
merous since World War II.
he continued.

In one of the more humor-
ous sightings. a family in
Kentucky was surrounded by
a landing party of small, hu
man-shaped aliens. The ali-
ens were frightened off only
by repeated shotgun blasts
from the family taking ref-
uge itiside their house.

Moseley then cited several
UFO sightings by large
groups and by reputable in
dividuals in the community

“IT tend to believe that

there is some truth in these
stories,’ he said. ‘I don't
know about all of them, but
some of them would seem to
be true,” noting similarities
in the stories and the lack
of reason for their fabrica-
tion.

The short film clip, which
purportedly showed a UFO
sighted in West Virginia.
showed a saucer-shaped ob-
ject darting back and forth
with tree leaves in the fore-
ground.

“as for the triviality of the
saucers’ activity, that makes
me more convinced,"’ Mose-
ley commented in a coffee
hour held afterward. “These
people, or whatever they are.
don't think in our thought
pattern. They might be as
much afraid of us as we are
of them.”

Moseley also did some
speculating on the origin of
the saucers. “‘They could be
from our own earth,” he
said, pointing out that many
areas of South America were
completely unexplored.

**More likely, 1 would as.
sume, the saucers came from
a planet nearer our own
home.” he concluded.

KEEPING THEM OUT OF TROUBLE

All those seniors who are

they want to do with their
lives would do well to get in

Bondurant Helps Solve
Student Legal Problems

By CHUCK GREEN
Statf Writer

Part of William L. Bondu-
rant's job as assistant to the
president and legal advisor
to the college is to aid stu-
dents who fall afoul of the
law.

Bondurant said. ‘‘So many
students don't. realize that
when they are off on a lark
somewhere an _ apparently
small violation of the law
with apparently simple con-
sequences today may be paid
for on a far greater degree
later when the student ap.
plies for graduate school, an
Army commission, or a
Rhodes Scholarship.”

His job as legal .adviser
has three phases. While the
college's major legal work is
Cone by a Charlotte attorney.
Bondurant handles the day
by day chores.

Secondly, he said, ‘I have
an arrangement with the
Dean of Students whereby if
a student finds himself in le-
gal difficulty and needs -an
attorney or someone associ-
ated with the college, I could
help him with no duty on my
part to report the student to
the college.”

He said the purpose of the
arrangement is to keep a stu-
dent from getting into more

trouble by running away
from trouble because they
might be afraid to seek help.

In the third phase of his

r-

job Bondurant said he could
help a student present his
case if he did run afoul of
the law.

Come gather ‘round people
Wherever you roan
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown.

And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone,

If your time to you is worth savin’
Then you better start swimmin'

Or you'll sink like a stone,

For the times they are a-changin’!

administered beginning Tues-
day by Director of Student
Counseling William B. Hight.

“The primary purpose of
the placement service is to
ensure that each senior en-
rolled in it will move into
the careers most suited to
him,” Covington said, ‘and
any senior who doesn't take
advantage of it is missing a
good bet."

The placement enrollee will
take two intelligence tests at
3:30 p.m. Tuesday and after-
wards will take four addiion-
al tests—one each day, Wed-
nesday through Saturday —
to determine facets of his
personality and vocational
inclinations. The tests are
scored and the results en-
tered into individual folders.

The enrollee then confers
with Hight. who explains the
results of the tests to him.

Meanwhile. Smith, Coving
ton, and Smith's assistant,
Miss Suzie Summers, con-

en ee

tact the companies which
will take part in placement.
They schedule these com-
panies for interviews, not
more than three per day.
and usually the company
sends descriptive literature
and an outline of the fobs to
be filled.

The student decides, with
the aid of his test results, the
career in which he is inter-
ested. He is then strongly en-
couraged to make use of the
Placement Library. which
contains information about
all types of vocational fields.
Armed with this information,
he decides which companies
he would like to interview.
and Covington and Summers
arrange the interviews.

By the end of the school
year the student is informed
as to what jobs are open to
him, and he makes his deci-
sion accordingly. This is the
payoff, not only for the stu
dent but for the placement
officers, according to Hight.

“The most satisfying aspect
of this program,"’ he said,
“4s to see the right boy with
the right opportunity in the
right company.”

“The main drawback,”
Hight continued, ‘is ‘that so
many students feel they do
not need placement, not re-
alizing what it can do for
them.”

Placement can be equally
useful to those planning to
go to graduate school or in
the service, Hight added, be-
cause it gives them contacts
with companies for future
reference at the same time
as it gives them insights in-
to their own personalities.

“A student can return after
graduation and take place-
ment, but it loses much of
its effectiveness then because
of the elapsed time. Hight
continued. “It is far better
for a student to go through
placement and never need it
than for him to miss it when
he may need it.”
