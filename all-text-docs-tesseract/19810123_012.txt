Review

The Ho-Toy

Why do the most dubious’
looking restaurants turn out to
be some of the best? Although
outwardly a small, unattractive
building and inwardly an Amer-
ican-style cafeteria, the Ho-Toy
Restaurant offers an excellent
selection of Chinese cuisine.

One can choose from combi-
nation dinners or a la carte. My
dinner companions and I chose
a lacarte. The egg rolls and egg
drop soup were superb. Other
appetizers offered are Won Ton
Soup, Chinese vegetable soup
and Chinese spare ribs.

The menu offers a wide
variety of entrees. One can
select from traditional Chinese
dishes such as Moo Goo Gai
Pan, a chicken and Chinese
vegetable dish, of from Chinese-
American dishes such as chow-
mein, chop suey and egg foo
yong. Each entree comes with
rice.

Between the five of us we
ordered four entrees and were
more than satisfied. With tea to
drink, the total price came to $6
a head. The only disappointing
event was that no fortune
cookies came with the check!

The Ho-Toy Restaurant is
located at 1220 Thomas Ave.
(just off East Independence
Ave) For more information ¢all
