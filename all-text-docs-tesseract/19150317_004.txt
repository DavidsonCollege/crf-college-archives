DR. RICHARDS IS GIVEN
LEAVE OF ABSENCE

At a congregational meeting last Sun-
day the Presbyterian church ot David:
son voted to give their pastor a leave of
four months in which to serve Davidson
College. Dr. Richards will leave the
ist of April. Of the prpspective $100.-
coo endowment fund, $6,000 has al-
ready been raised. Dr. Richards will
help to raise the remainder -of this.

His plan is, briefly as follows: He
will raise the money among the alumni.
Each class of alumni will be organized,
and will be urged to contribute $500.
This, it is hoped, will bring splendid
results.

Dr. Richards expects to devote the
whole time of four months to this. He
has undertaken a great work for the
college at no small cost to himself.
Davidson men owe a debt of gratitude
to their pastor and the church which
has so unselfishly allowed him to go.

During his absence the church will
be supplied by speakers from other
places.

MRS. MOTTE MARTIN
HERE WEDNESDAY

Mrs. Motte Martin was at Davidson
last week. Wednesday afternoon she
made a talk to the Ladies’ Missionary
Society. Immediately following — that,
from 5 to 6:30 o'clock the Student Vol-
unteer Band met with her at Dr. Ar-
buckle’s home.

The meeting held was a most enjoy-
able one. It was entirely informal, so
much so as to hardly fit the name of
meeting, but rather a chat. lt was en-
tirely made up of questions and answers
about all the mission fields, and Africa
especially. All conceivable questions
were fired at Mrs. Martin, but they
were readily answered with many pieces
of valuable advice. It was no small
regret to the Volunteers that the sup
per bell rang so soon,

Mrs. Martin during her visit stayed
at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Arbuckle.
Before going to Africa Mrs. Martin
went to college at Agnes Scott and was
for several years a pupil of Dr. Ar-

buckle.
