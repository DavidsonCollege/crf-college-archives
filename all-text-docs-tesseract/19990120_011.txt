“Midseason Q&A with Bob McKillop.

Davidson’s head skipper discusses
shocker over UMASS, subsequent set-
backs, and the quest for another fabu-
lous February

On Thursday January 14th,
Davidsonian Sports Staff member
Stephen Cefalu caught up with head
men’s basketball coach Bob McKillop
to discuss some of the high notes and
low notes of what has already been a
very tumultuous 1998-99 season.

DSS: What would you say was the
significance of the victory over
UMASS on December 29th?

McKillop: UMASS is a national team
in terms of respect and recognition. To
beat a team that has that kind of respect
and recognition on their home court is
quite an accomplishment, quite a state-
ment. The way we won also makes the
victory significant. To be down 15
points at the half, with many people
thinking we were dead and buried, and
then somehow find a way to come back
to tie in regulation and take it away from
them in overtime, that made the win
very special.

DSS: What about the win at home
over Appalachian State in your na-
tionally televised conference opener?

McKillop: The victory against App.
St., a formidable foe whom we met last
year in the Southern Conference tour-
nament championship, coming back to
back with the win at UMASS provided
a great boost to our program. That
whole week was a real statement about

Football captain
commissioned
2nd Lt.

By Mike ANDERSON

Sports Editor

As captain of the °98 Davidson
football team, Tom Dugan helped
lead the Wildcats to the winningest
season in school history.

Now, the twenty-three year old
from Maryland has assumed a far
more weighty leadership role. This
one comes with the rank of lieuten-
ant.

Dugan | graduated from
Davidson after the fall semester and
this past Saturday was commissioned
a second lieutenant in the United
States Army.

The quarterback, who holds the
school’s record for most career total
yards, will ship out to Fort
Leonardwood, Missouri to com-
mence service in the prestigious
Army Corps of Engineers. But first
he will spend a few more months
with the DavidsonR.O.T.C. program
through which he earned his com-
mission. Dugan will serve as a Gold
Bar Recruiter through May 15; his
duties will include helping to recruit
future students. “It will nice for pro-
spective students to see what people
have gone through for four years,
and where they ended up, they’ II be
able to relate to him,” explained Cap-
tain William Geiger.

“[Dugan]’s a natural born
: |leader. He’s going to be areal asset to
this nation’s military,” lauded team-
mate Tom Ting. “His leadership to
our football team was visible at prac-
tice, on the game field, in the locker

the potential for success this team has.

DSS: Would it be fair to describe the
team’s performance thus far as
schizophrenic?

McKillop: Yeah, real up and down,
very inconsistent. Consistency is the
elusive quality that this team is trying to
grab hold of right now. Generally, we
reach a point of consistency about this
time of year. Jeff (Bergmann)’s injury
disrupted our rotation, though, and that
intrudes upon consistency. People un-
derstood and were comfortable with
their roles. Then after that VMI game
(in which Bergmann’s injury occurred)
and five straight wins, some roles had to
be immediately adjusted. Inthe process
of making those subtle adjustments,
that consistent pattern we had achieved
got disrupted. Now we’re gradually
finding that comfort zone again. We’re
reestablishing our rotation.

DSS: Perhaps in the context of teams
of the recent past, how would you
describe this team’s cohesion ?

McKillop: Our team chemistry is su-
perb. Guys are pulling for each other,
cheering for each other, helping each
other, and wanting success for each
other. Guys are accepting the roles
defined for them and willing to do not
only what is expected but whatever
they can to help the team. What may, in
fact, be happening is that we’re maybe
trying a little bit too hard. If you think
of baseball vernacular, it’s like we're
trying to step up to the plate and hit a
home run every time, instead of just

making solid contact. Well, solid con-
tact.is all you need to hit home runs.
They come naturally. We’ve tried too
hard to fulfill expectations placed upon
us by others to dominate the division.
Conference play is. very competitive.
There’s a very fine line between wins
and losses. Last year we had to get a last
second stop to beat UNCG up at their
place, and yet people get amnesia about
that stuff. They only remember the
successes. Everyone expected us to go

into UNCG this year and just trounce .

them. .

DSS: When conference teams, such
as ETSU and UNCG, are with you
late in the game, do you get the sense
that they smell blood and go for the
jugular more so than in previous
years?

McKillop: Any team that has had suc-
cess in its previous year is gonna be a
target. Our record in conference play
has been very impressive over the last
few years. When you have that kind of
success, all of a sudden you become the
object of people’s preparation and pas-
sion. You become the marquee. game
on their schedule, the one they high-
light, underline, putin bold. They come
after you with their best shot. We quite
simply have to be ready to take people’s
best shots every time we step on the
court.

DSS: How do you and your coaching
staff retain perspective amidst all the
anxiety generated by the ups and
downs of a season ?

McKillop: Part of building a program
is being able to stay in a position of
respect. I’m thrilled that our players
have done that. Its areal tribute to them.

“Instead of having just a great season,

what we want most is to have a great
program. A great program commands
respect year after year after year. I
really believe that’s why we’re getting
respect right now, even after we’ ve lost
acouple of games we weren’t supposed
to. People are disappointed with our
losses because they have such high ex-
pectations for us. Those expectations
come from our success.

DSS: What will it take to right the
ship and ensure stability down the
stretch, to ensure another fabulous
February?

McKillop: Our guys just have to be-
lieve in the system and believe in them-
selves. They have to let offense happen
and make defense happen. Right now,
they’re trying foo much to make of-
fense happen. We have to avoid play-
ing with too much of a sense of urgency
on offense. That’s crippling. We’ re not
making our opponents defend, not mak-
ing them expend energy, and so they
have full stamina stored up for offense,
and they wear our defense down. They
use twenty or twenty-five seconds of
the shot clock and make us endure their
best shot every time. We also need to
get to the free throw line more consis-
tently and make our free throws. Idon’t
think any of our difficulties have been
technical. Our techniques are good.
Our system is good. We’re in fine
shape. If the five guys in our system are

functioning, we’re gonna have success.
This is a very smart and experienced
team. They understand the dynamics of
what’s going on. There’s no need for
our captains to step up and crack the
whip. People are working hard. These...
guys want to win. They want to get
better.

DSS: Ifit plays up to its utmost poten-
tial, what is this year’s team capable
of accomplishing?

McKillop: We’ ve set as our goal this
year, to get better every game. That’s
the standard we operate by. Clearly, we
want to be at our best at the end of the
season when the conference tournament
rolls around. This team has learned a
tremendous amount through the ups
and downs it’s experienced over these
first couple of months. Only through
the exposure of yourself do you find out
who you truly are. This team has ex-
posed itself. This team has taken innu-
merable risks. This team has dared to
dream, dared to be a better team than
last year, dared to establish higher goals.
In the process of risking and daring, and
striving and dreaming, sometimes you
get knocked to the mat. We’ve gotten
knocked to the mat, but learned from it.
We may get knocked to the mat again, -
but as long as we continue to learn from
it, when it comes time for that critical
weekend in February, we'll be where
we want to be: at our best. Do we really
want to go unscathed in conference
play and then learn our lessons in the
tournament? No. That happened three
years ago. It wasn’t much fun.

MENS’ TRACK

Men’s track begins season in strong fashion

By Keith GorDON
Sports Writer

The 1999 edition of the Wildcat
men’s track team opened it’s indoor
season last Saturday in a three-team
meet at UNC-Asheville. Although not
at full force due to injuries and training,
the team posted impressive finishes in
many events.

Coach Gary Andrew echoed these
sentiments: “Saturday was a strong ef-

fort overall and a great start to the sea-
son. We performed well against the
competition, and many of the returning
runners ran faster times than at last
year’s meet.”

Leading the way was freshman
standout Dan Gibson, who won, the
3000m in a time of 9:34.35. Also plac-
ing for fhe men were Keith Chapman
(4th) and Paul Irwin (Sth). Gibson, the
team’s #1 recruit, finished fourth last
year at the Ohio Division I State Cham-

pionships and hopes to anchor the mid-
distance corps throughout the season.
William Isenhour and Davey Ba-
con led the team in the mile, finishing
3rd and 4th respectively. The sprint
group was also well represented, as
Addam Marcotte placed Sth in the 40-
yard dash and Michael Albert finished
4th in the 500m. The 4 x 400m relay
team, comprised of John Moore, Grant
Bleecher, Stan Baker, and Michael
Albert, brought home a 3rd place finish
