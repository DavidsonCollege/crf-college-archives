Stone Still Optimistic
Despite Mediocre Mark

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

Where does a team with a 2-
4-1 record go at this point in
the season?

Chip Stone, head coach of the
Davidson soccer team feels that
a conference championship is
still a possibility, though not
quite as great a one as before.

‘‘We have really had a
demanding schedule during the
past two weeks,’’ explained
Stone. ‘‘But we are through the
toughest part of the season and
it has helped us tremendously.”’

The ‘demanding schedule”
was led by a string of seven
matches in only 15 days, quite a
bit for any team. This is
especially true when the squad
faced Carolina, Duke and Ap-
palachian in a five-day period.

“The loss to Appalachian was
really hard to take,’’ com-
mented the first year coach. ‘‘I
think we are as good a team as
they are, if not better. We
played them on equal terms.
They just had two more shots to
goin.”

But the crucial part of the
drive for the Southern Con-
ference title is still in its early
stages.

‘Furman and The Citadel are
both much improved over last
year,” said Stone. ‘‘Either of
them could beat Appalachian.
Of course, they could each beat
us, too.”

That sets the dilemma. Ap-
palachian could lose one game
and the Wildcats would be right
back in the conference race.

‘TI do not think that we are out
of it by any means,” Stone poin-
ted out. ‘‘It is very likely that

the race could go to any of four
teams. And we are just as likely
to get it as anyone else.”

Stone went on to clarify his
position saying that he feels the
club has gained valuable ex-
perience from just competing
with teams such as Duke and
Carolina.

“They are really good ball
control teams,” praised the for-
mer UNC student. I know that
we have benefitted from
playing with them.”

One reason Stone feels that
the team has not been able to
use much of this added ex-
perience is the minute amount
of practice that they have had
recently.

“When you play as many
games as we have in so short a
time, you just cannot find the
time to practice and make any
adjustments, much less get any
rest,’’ emphasized Stone. ‘‘Sin-
ce we have had some time prior
to tomorrow’s match, we should
be in good shape.”’

Tomorrow the Cats travel to

.Furman for an important con-

ference encounter with the

Paladins.

“I am really looking for a
complete turnaround in our
record,’ Stone predicted with
an air of confidence. ‘‘I think
that we will be ready for the
rest of our opponents.”’

Many of Stone’s preseason
hopes are not going to be
fulfilled, including a bid to the
NCAA playoffs.

But the Cat meentor knows
that the experience of the tough
schedule will be very beneficial
to the future of Davidson soc-
cer.

‘We are setting out to build a
soccer program here and im-
prove it,’’ Stone stated flatly.
“It will take losing a few more
games than most people are
used to. But it is the only way,
since we do not have the money
to recruit better players,
building the program that way.

“‘We have eight freshmen who
can play with anybody. The
loss of (Tom) Tornee will hurt
for sure. But it will also give us
a chance to see some other
people who would normally not
play as much.”’

T.H.E. Cat Finds Cheerleading Mate

By CHRIS YOUNG
Staff Writer

Less than three weeks ago as
the Davidson football squad
took to the field against Lenoir
Rhyne, most Davidson students
were gathered at Richardson
Field expecting a repeat of the
Davidson performance a week
earlier against Richmond.

As usual, T.H.E. Cat was

Club Football Chokes
Against West Piedmont

By JORDAN CLARK
Staff Writer

A Western Piedmont field
goal with 8 seconds left in the
game sent the Davidson Club
football team to its fourth
defeat of the season, in a 16-14
decision.

The loss was particularly bit-
ter for the Cats as there was
some question of the accuracy
of the timekeeper.

Piedmont jumped out to an
early 13-0 lead with two first
quarter scores. Frank Rader of
Davidson blocked one of the two
extra point attempts.

While recovering from its
early-game defensive errors,
the Wildcat offense began
rolling and climaxed a lengthy
drive with Lester Abbeger’s
reception of Jimmy Boyd's 10
yard scoring pass.

Boyd ran in the two-point con-
version.

Moments later, Bob Wetzel
intercepted a pass and brought
Davidson deep into Piedmont
territory. Freshman Bill Bishop
ran three yards for the touch-
down which sent the Cats into a
halftime lead of 14-13.

The second half proved to be
quite a defensive battle as
neither team was able to
dominate play.

It appeared that the Cats half-

time margin might stand up
with only 25 seconds remaining
in the game and the score still
14-13.

But to the amazement of the
Wildcats, Piedmont pulled the
nifty feat of running three plays
in the next 17 seconds, and bare-
footed Bud Loudermilch booted
the winning field goal with just
seconds remaining.

Co-Captain Wetzel com-
mented, “It was for sure the
longest 25 seconds of my life.
They ran four plays without
stopping the clock.”

‘“‘We were quite disappointed
with the loss. It wasn’t so much
the losing, though, but the way

we lost that bothered us,”’ Wet-

zel said.

The next game will be at 2
p.m. Sunday when the clubbers
meet visiting Winthrop.

there sporting a new hairy
costume to try to egg the Wild-
cats on to victory.

Few will forget T.H.E. Cat’s
death-defying swings from the
Johnston gym balcony last
basketball season.

As game time approached, to
the amazement of the crowd,
the team, and T.H.E. Cat, a
female appeared on the field.
(This was not one of your or-
dinary run-of-the-mill co-eds,
but a female, hairy-costumed
Wildcat. . someone for T.H.E.
to play with.)

parked by the presence of
this young lady Wildcat, the
Cats offense found new life and
went on to post a 20-17 victory
over the Lenoir Rhyne Bears.
(Perhaps another reason for the
victory was the Lenoir Rhyne
Black Bear couldn’t handle the
presence of two Davidson Wild-
cats.)

And so it was - the start of but
another Davidson tradition. As
T.H.E. remarked, ‘‘It started
off rather awkward, but as time
goes on we're getting our stuff
together.”’

The young lady with whom
T.H.E. is getting it together is,
of course, Sally Stow, a product
of the Watts 1 Wimpettes. She
became interested in becoming
a Wildcat at the Activities Fair.

With the help of Tom Scott,
she had her costume in two
weeks and was ready to go for
the Lenoir Rhyne game.
