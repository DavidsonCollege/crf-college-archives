Adult literacy program sees success

By JIM DILLON

A love of literature and the
hope that more people will learn to
read inspired Frances Frame, a
junior English major, to begin a
program for adult literacy using
Davidson students as tutors.

Just four months after the first
tutor training workshop was of-
fered, five tutor-student pairs are
working together, and 15 more
tutors have just completed their
training to begin tutoring.

“It was just something I'd al-
ways wanted to do. I love to read,
and I’m an English major. I'd like
to see more people learn to read,
and it’s a really good way to reach
people,” Frame said.

The second set of training
workshops was completed yester-
day. Frame says she thinks the
tutors get a lot out of the literacy
program.

“I think they get a sense of
satisfaction. They are giving back
some of what they’ ve been given.
There are Davidson students who
have been given BMW’s, and
there are others who have been on
work study the whole time, but the
one thing we’ve all been given is
an education. We all know how to
read. I think they get a sense of
satisfaction from sharing that,”
Frame said.

Tutors are trained by a repre-
sentative of the Mecklenburg
County Literacy Council. They
learn how to deal with potential

students and how to teach using
the Laubach reading program.
Frame says teaching an adult to
read is quite different from teach-
ing a child.

“It’s not so much in how you
teach that’s different, but there’s a
difference in the students them-
selves. The adult is there because
he wants to be. He knows that he
needs to know how to read
whereas a child is there because he
has to be. In that sense, they are
more willing to learn, but it’s har-
der for them in some senses be-
cause they’ve been out of a class-
room environment for longer,”
Frame said.

Frame said right now the em-
phasis of the program is on getting
more illiterate students since fif-
teen more tutors are available, and
she .doubted that further work-
shops will be conducted this year.

Although Frame said most
students have different levels of
ability and knowledge, they are all
technically illiterate when they
begin the program. “They can’t
read road signs or a map. They
can’t write down someone’s
name, and so they have to re-
member it. They can’t fill out a
job application or read the want
ads,” Frame said.

Andy Doherty, a freshman
who is currently tutoring, said
there is a definite need for literacy
training in the area.

“From what I understand, a

third of the people in Mecklen-
burg county can’t read. The
people in the cities kind of have
to, and it’s the people in the sub-
urbs who can’t,” Doherty said.

Doherty says he became inter-
ested in the program because he
likes to work with people and be-
Cause it was a new opportunity for
him

“It’s something I had never in
my whole life even come close to
doing — me teaching someone
else instead of someone teaching
me. I’m getting to see if I can actu-
ally teach. I'd consider it an
accomplishment if I can do that,”
Doherty said. -

Doherty said a normal session
begins with basic vocabulary, and

Translator lectures
on poet, Seifert

By AARON LEVINE

Hampden-Sydney _ professor
Paul Jagasich, a translator of
poems by the late Czechoslova-
kian poet Jaroslav Seifert, will
speak on “Translating Seifert:
Global Political Conflict in Liter-
ary Perspective” next Wednesday
at 7:30 p.m. in the 900 Room. At
8:30 a.m., he plans to give an in-
terview on WDAV.

History professor Robin
Barnes was instrumental in bring-
ing Jagasich to Davidson.
“Seifert’s fame results partly from
the quality of his poetry and partly
from the fact that he had to deal as
a creative writer with a regime un-
friendly to much of wht he said,”
Barnes said.

Jagasich and another
Hampden-Sydney professor Tom

O’Grady were active in tracking
down Seifert’s works by going to
Czechoslovakia in 1984 to meet
with Seifert.

In the Nov. 27, 1984 issue of
the Richmond Times-Dispatch, an
article said the professors’ journey
had the quality of a spy thriller in-
volving an ambassador's covert
aid, an embassy’s back room
copiers, meeting several contacts
from “friends of friends or more
friends” in coffee houses. Detec-
tion by the authorities was an
ever-present possibility.

Another issue of the Times-
Dispatch said, “The Hampden-
Sydney College teachers talk of
posing as tourists, of resorting to
diplomatic pouches or body belts,
of arrangements with Soviet
accomplices . . .

”

later they work relating the words
to simple sentences. He added he
and the student haven’t gotten far
enough to manipulate words so
the student can decipher them;
“like changing bat to cat.”

“Even though we've just
Started out, I think we're really
making progress,” he said.

Before his death in 1985 at the
age of 84, Seifert was at constant
odds with the Czech communist
regime over the content of his
poems which openly advocate
political freedom. His works were
banned from the Czech public
until very recently. Many of his
works were smuggled to the West.

In 1968 a collection of his
poems on microfilm were smug-
gled out taped to the leg of a
British embassy worker. This col-
lection, The Casting of Bells, won
him the Nobel Prize for Litera-
ture.

Barnes recommends this lec-
ture for all students, but particu-
larly for students interested in in-
ternational relations and global
political conflicts.

Strategic planning task force report released

By NELLE McCORKLE

The Strategic Planning document will
be released today, Assistant to the President
Rick Love said. Prepared by a 17-member
task force of student, faculty, administra-
tion, alumni and trustee representatives ap-
pointed by President Kuykendall, “The
plan recommends a direction for Davidson
College by identifying objectives and estab-
lishing priorities among those interests
which compete for institutional allocations
of talent, time and money ,” according to the
introduction of the latest draft.

In April 1985, the Board of Trustees di-
rected Kuykendall to prepare this report; the
document’s release coincides with the Feb.
20-21 Board meeting. The Strategic Plan-
ning document is unofficial until reviewed
by the trustees, who may accept, reject or
recommend further work upon the docu-
ment. “It’s not graven in stone, not having
constitutional status it’s a working paper,”
Kuykendall said. “It’s not intended to be
kind of a living document subject to con-
stant scrutiny and annual revision.”
Kuykendall said he intends to propose to the
trustees that the document’s first revision
begin in April, with a report made at the Oc-
tober board meeting. Members of the Revi-
sion Task Force will be a “representative
group not named as individuals but named
for their offices”; Kuykendall will appoint
these people.

“A strategic plan by its very nature is a
holistic view,” Kuykendall said. “All parts

have to be knit together in the
whole . . . it’s supposed to be a piece and
metamorphosis.”

A faculty/staff forum and a student
forum are scheduled for Feb. 11 to discuss
the Strategic Planning document, Kuyken-

dall will moderate each meeting. Asked
what the next step for the report is Kuyken-
dall said, “The immediate next step of
course is the two forums, and that next step
is primarily an effort to encourage comment
and provide some familiarity for the com-
munity at large before it [the report] goes to
the Board of Trustees.”

Aspects of the report Kuykendall ex-
pects to attract attention include its
priorities for use of capital funds: “Capital
projects always attract the most attention
and are surely subject to infinite debate.”
Kuykendall said capital projects mentioned
in the report represent establishment of
priorities rather than immediate plans for
construction.

Kuykendall said he expects students to
be interested in the Strategic Planning docu-
ment’s statements on admissions recruit-
ment, curriculum review and student life.
He hopes student response will be, “first of
all. . . an expression of genuine interest;
secondly, creative commentary, with affir-
mation, revision or in some cases rejection
of what’s there.” Student comment based
on the forum and outside response will be
used in evaluating the document, Kuyken-
dall said.

SGA President Beadsie Woo said of the
student forum, “Students should read the
document and, not only come, but speak
out. It is important that people who both
agree and disagree with the document
come.”

The Task Force referred to the self-
study for data and recommendations ac-
cording to the final draft introduction.
Members of the Task Force are: trustee Wil-
liam -K. Davis; alumni Susan Baynard
Clayton, ’78 and William L. Rikard '67,

faculty: Laurence S. Cain, Gail M. Gibson,
John D. Kelton °51, Benjamin G. Klein
(vice chairman and pro tem of the faculty),
and Lance K. Stell; students Woo and Mark
Sandy; administration: Robert W. David-
son, John V. Griffith, John W. Kuykendall
