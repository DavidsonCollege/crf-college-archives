a committee be appointed to draw up
resolutions and plans to be presented

committee, however,

Dr. J. C. Rowan, '04, of Concord, pas-
tor of the First Presbyterian Church
of that city, has recently suggested that
the night service on Sunday be abolish-
ed in order that members of the con-
gregation can use that time in doing
practical Christian work. His sugges-
tion has attracted state-wide attention,
and_even beyond the state. A number
of editorials have been written repard-
ing this practical idea.

Mr. A. H. Hollingsworth, Ji; 20, <8
senior at Union Theological Seminary,
has been awarded the Larus fellow-
ship next year, which means that he
will continue to study at the seminary
and will also teach. Mr. Ralston Bit-
