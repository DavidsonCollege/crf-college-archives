2nd AGS Chapter Conceived:™*°""

Locals Greet Scott Offspring

Ed, Note—The following communication marks a major breakthrough in the Anti-Gnomitic
Society's all-out campaign to defeat the Gnomes. Members of the Alpha Chapter of AGS at David-
son welcome the establishment of « Beta Chapter at Agnes Scott. Although thie letter requests
thet a charter be sent to Scott, a Gnome spokesman has pointed out that “They should write the
charter themselves and have it approved by us. After aft, this is a creative organization.”

Dear Alpha Chapter of Anti-Gnomitic Society:
Upon reading the account in the October 11 issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN we, a

group

We are convinced of the ex-
cellence and fruitfulness of your
new-born group from our read-
ing of your ideals and standards
as set forth in that article.

We therefore crave the dis-
tinction of being the second—or
Beta—chapter to be delivered
from the womb of productive
minds —viz._of our minds as
impregnated by this conception
of yours. (Please pardon the
mixed metaphor.)

We realize, however. the prob-
lems inherent in the adaptation
of an ideal set by men to meet
the needs of a men's campus to
be one which would be appro-
priate and relevant to a wom-
en's campus. The only digres-
sions from your program that
we deem necessary for us are
the following:

tion of a gnome—a girl is not
in the same situation as a boy

Ed. Note—The Gnomess author of the following letter at-
tempted to keep her identity secret from the powerful forces of
the Antl-Gnomitic Society. However, through their incomparable
communications network, diligent Anti-Gnomitic underground
investigators soon unearthed one 8, B. “Squirrel” Chafin, of
Greensboro College, as the perpetrator of the Gnome War on

Creativity.
Dear Alpha Chapter of A. G

.S.:

Having read the recent article “Gnome Gnappers
Gnab Gnomes” in THE DAVIDSONIAN, we feel compelled

to offer several comments.

First, it is our contention that
the article was. grossly misnam-
ed. The correct title should have |
been “Immature Idiots Incar-:
cerate. Irresponsibles.” |

Secondly. we are appalled at
the idea that the future leaders
of America have regressed to
such childish modes of behavior.

It is quite obvious that the
members of the A. G. S. are in!
reality; projecting their own!
inadequacies into the personality |
characteristics of Gnomes.

Heed our warning! ! ! Tran-
scend this pettiness! If you de-|
sire to rise above so-called
Gnomism, display in practical
applications the qualities which
you as A.G.S.’s have deemed so|
worthy. '

Ask yourselves this question. !
“Is this your idea of creativity?”
We sincerely hope that you will
justify our faith in you by an-
swering this question negative-
ly.

Sincerely.

Although we would like noth-

such a listing in such a hostile
way that our chapter would

AGS Spokesman Hits GC,
Suggests Higher Standards

Dear C.A.R.E.:

Society, let me express my appreciation for the com-
ments contained in your recent letter. Your suggestions
have indeed had a great effect on the members of our

society.

Prior to your letter, we had
been unsuccessful in locating
the heart of female Gnomism
in North Carolina. Now we are
confident that we have pinpoint-
ed the Gnomess stronghold and
can effectively concentrate our
attack.

There are two apparent dis-
crepancies in your letter which
T feel are worthy of notice. First,
you suggest that the correct

As this week's spokesman, for the -

DAVLDSONIAN | should have
been “Immature Idiots Incar-
cerate Irresponsibles.” Your
choice of the word “Irresponsi-
bles” has led us to question
just whose side you are on.

Secondly, you refer to the
members of the AGS as “future
leaders of America.” For this,
we applaud your judgment and
foresight, but we are neverthe-
less puzzled by the inconsistancy

THE DAVIDSONIAN

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1963

By van den Bere Malas ‘Pure As Snow’
Despite Coed Pressures

A man by the name of Art Buchwald who writes, a
nationally syndicated column, decided to interview | a
representative group of college males to determine the
national attitude concerning the subject of premarital
sex, and came up with some rather interesting comments.
Following are excerpts from his column:

“A University of Southern
California football player said,
‘I think there has been an over-
emphasis on promiscuity on col-
lege campuses. It’s true that
there are a few weak men who
may succumb to a persistent
coed, but the majority of college
men believe in chastity and
wouldn't think of having an af-
fair during the happiest years
of their lives.’

“Two Princeton men we fiet
were first very wary about dis-
cussing the problem, but [finally
one of them said: “I think it’s
all right for college girls to be
emancipated, since after all,
they have nothing to lose, but as
a man I’m very idealistic about
such things. Besides, I think
girls think so much less of you
when you give’ in. I don’t want
them saying in their dormitor-

Sophs Soak Assaulting Frosh

BY JOHN BARNHARDT AND TOM LOFLIN
Thursday night a week ago under a starry midnight sky, three dark figures could be observed lurking near
the college workshop behind Cannon. Suddenly they became bold and began to rifle the scrap woodpile.

The three were not thieves, time. until the clothes started across Belk’s front lawn in his anybody.”

but freshmen sign-makers gath-
ering material for their trade.
several signs appeared
bearing the words: “BURN THE
BEANIES!”

With this rather innocent
start, the evening soon became
the biggest Freshman Riot of
the year. Encouraged no doubt
by the homemade symbols of
their class unity, other fresh-
men soon had a bonfire flam-
ing into the night. Then began
a thing strange at Christian
Davidson—pagan rites. The
youngest classmen began to
dance around the fire, chanting
puerile fulminations, their num-
bers growing every minute.

Suddenly the enemies of their
class began to gather on the
porch of Belk—the sophomores!
Undoubtedly wishing to save
the night from the noise of Dav-
idson's splitting siren, the sec-
ond-year class formed a fire
brigade, and soon there was no

flying. One freshman was soon
prepared, a trifle early, for
dance weekend. He was left to
blush with only a shred of a
shirt on his body and one Wee-
jun on a foot. Undaunted by his

lack of proper battle gear, he

continued in the fray.

While the battle of the classes
raged, Student Body President
John Spratt, an avowed enemy
of fun on campus, stood dis-
gruntedly by with little to say
and less to do. And he might
have been the wettest person
on the field that night.

But then on Friday, with the
first groups of parents begin-
ning to drive in for Freshman
Parents Day, Spratt thought he
might have his own fun by. or-
ganizing a clean-up committee
of guilty freshmen. Parents are
probably still talking about
those pants flying in the place
of Old Glory that afternoon—
‘and that character running

undershorts.

“That character” was Spratt,
and he had this to say about the
doings: “I am a good sport. It
was all in the spirit of clean
American fun. I’m not mad at

A freshman who worked on
the clean-up detail was not grip-
ing too much. He overlooked the

“menial task in light of his great-

er activity the night before. As
he put it, “It was fun!”

|
ies that I'm a “loose guy.” I
prize my reputation above every-
thing else.’

“A Harvard man said, ‘When I
first came to Harvard, several of
the students asked me if I would
“go all the way” with a girl. I
didn’t even know what it meant.
but when I found out I reported
them to the dean. I believe a
school is judged by its students,
and I would hate to believe the
girls from Smith and Vassar
and Radcliffe would think Har-
vard men had such thoughts in
their heads.’

“We asked a Yale senior,
home on vacation, if he believ-
ed that a man should submit to
relations before he is married.
‘Certainly not,’ he told us. ‘Col-
lege girls may call me old-fash-
joned but I think a nice boy
Should remain pure.’

“We talked to at least 200
male college students and not
one of them admitted to having
had a promiscuous relationship.
It was a very encouraging thing
and gave us faith in the youth
of America. If our survey is cor-
rect, the college boy is keenly
aware of the inherent dangers
in sexual emancipation and, de-
spite the enormous pressures
from college coeds, he will, in
almost all cases, graduate as
pure as the driven snow.”

SALUTE: TOM ASHWORTH

Southern Bell Telephone Accountant Tom Ashworth
(B.B.A.. 1958) is one of his compaiy’s most knowledgeable
experts on computers.

- Tom has harnessed computers to many tasks. After
general assignments and five months’ training in punched
card data processing, Tom was put in charge of converting
the existing manual billing of Long Distance calls to a
mechanized operation in Memphis. His job was to decide
how the work would be done and to develop new procedures
for doing it more swiftly.

After following up the first Memphis conversion job,

he still teaches computérs new accounting feats.

Tom Ashworth, like many young men, is impatient to
make things happen for his company and himself. There
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.
