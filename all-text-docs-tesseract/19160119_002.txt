AN OPPORTUNITY.

It has been well said that a college is
a place of opportunity for all who enter
it. There are to be found there advan-
tages for training that cannot be dupli-
cated in any other place. This is true
because the business of a college is to
train men and women for filling with
ability whatever places they are to take
in life, and to this business the college
devotes its whole time.

In an age when the demand is for the
well rounded man and for one with
ideas, it is necessary that the broadest
training possible be obtained if the re-
sponsible positions of life are to be filled
creditably and successfully. It has be-
come therefore the policy of the up-to-
date colleges to introduce into their
courses whatever will tend to broaden
the views of the students or give them
new ideas. In pursuance of this policy
a number of colleges have adopted the
plan of having lecturers from other in-
stitutions, from professional and business
life, and men noted in literature to de-
liver to the students lectures on various
subjects of interest and profit.

In another column of this issue will
be found the announcement of the first
of such a series of lectures that has been
planned by the college for the Spring
term. These lectures will be on subjects
of science, education, literature and busi-
ness, and will well repay all of the stu-
dents who attend them. This is the first
time that such a series has been tried at
Davidson, and if the students show the
proper interest they will be continued.
Otherwise they will be dropped. All of
the students and townspeaplte are urged
and invited to attend them. T. J. M.

Balance on hand

The money made during the year
1913 was promised to the Davidson
Graded School. At the beginning of
the year 1915 $43.57 of this money was
still in the treasury. It has been paid
out as follows: $2.00 for prizes at the
school, and $41.57 for blackboards.

It is the earnest hope of the Club that
there will be a decided increase in the
membership this year, and also an in-
crease in interest on the part of each
member.

If any one has any suggestions for the
improvement of the Club in any de-
partment of its work please give them to

Mrs. J. M. McConnell, the president.
