Six Firers made the trip. They
‘are Bill Blakley, Ronnie Lewis,
iJim Young, Dick Levy, Lowell

Sgt. Clifton Newby, team
coach, said that he expected
tougher competition from the
Paladin harriers than the ’Cats
had in their first meet, a tri-
match with Wofford and Pres-
byterian College. The ‘Cat firers
took that match with a score of
1358.

Wofford was able to score
1331 and the P.C. firers shot a
1323. High scorer for the match
was Bill Blakley with a 283 out
of a possible 300. Continued
high scores should put Blakley
in contention for a position on
the All-Conference team.

Frosh Close Season;

Davidson's freshmen gridders
travel to Shelby, N. C., to play
Gardner Webb Jr. College to-
morrow. This is the Wildkittens’
final game of the season.

Capt. Donald Threlkeld,
freshman team coach, said that
Gardner Webb has a very strong
ground attack, but does little
passing. He commented, “They
have small fast backs and a big
line, just like we do.”

The frosh mentor added that
Gardner Webb uses the same
type of defense as the ‘Kittens
and a similar offense. He also
said that he expects to pass
more against Gardner Webb
than the ‘Kittens have previous-
ly.

A comparison of game scores
throws no light on the probable
outcome of the game. The Fur-
man frosh downed Gardner
Webb 140, and the ’Kittens
overcame Furman by the same
score. However, Gardner Webb
beat Ferrum Jr. College earlier
in the season 12-0, and Ferrum
plodded to a 7-0 victory over the
Davidson frosh last Saturday.

Commenting on last Satur-
day’s game with Ferrum, coach
Threlkeld had nothing but
praise for his defensive unit
which played a “whale of a
ball game.” This same defense
blocked three Ferrum punts and
held the winners to one first
down in the game, which was
played in a veritable quagmire

HOW THE CONFERENCE SHAPES UP

Taking a quick look at Southern Conference foot-
ball it’s not hard to see who the probable champs are.
VMI moved to a 5-0 conference record Jast week with
an 16-7 victory over The Citadel.

The only thing standing between the Keydets and
the conference crown is a tough VPI squad, possessing a
mediocre 2-2 conference and 4-4 overail record. This
record is somewhat deceptive, however. This VPI team
is the same one that pulled off a surprising upset against
Virginia, and was almost able to knock off Army. VMI
will have their hands full on Nov. 22 when they tangle
with the Gobblers, if they want the glory of the crown.

Sitting back and waiting for VMI to make a slip is
West Virginia with a 3-0 conference record. They only
play four conference games this year, and, although this
is enough to make them eligible for the crown, it means
that even if they don’t lose a conference game they can
still lose the championship, since VMI plays six confer-
ence games.

We are still picking West Virginia as probable con-
ference champs, however. They have a powerful team and
shouldn't have any trouble polishing off their one fur-
ther opponent, The Citadel. Whereas VMI is just as likely
to drop a decision to VPI.

Looking over the Southern Conference as a whole,
it seems that the year went pretty much as was expected,
with few surprise upsets. Perhaps the most remarkable
upsurge of any team has been that of William & Mary, a
team only able to win one game last year, and who now
sit in the third place in conference standings with a
3-2-1 record.

Another fact that isn’t too hard to see from looking
at the standings .is that unless Davidson beats Richmond
tomorrow, the ’Cats will wind up in the Conference cellar.
With a victory, they could find themselves sixth in con-
ference standings.

BASKETBALL ON THE MOVE

This year’s basketball. season isn’t even underway
yet, and they’re already thinking of bigger and better

gs.

Athletic Director Tom Scott revealed this week that
at least two new top notch teams will be added to the
Wildcat schedule for the 1963 and 1964 seasons, with
prospects for adding several more good teams.

The ’Cat basketballers have been scheduled to play
Ohio State in Ohio in 1963 and here in 1964. Another top
team scheduled for the 'Cats is St. Joseph, always a power
in the East. They will play here in 1963 and in Philadel-
phia in 1964.

There is a strong possibility that three other teams
will be added to the 1963 basketball. schedule. These
teams are Marquette, Virginia, and Alabama, whom the
’Cats dumped twice last season.

Four games have already been scheduled for the
Coliseum in Charlotte, an increase of one over the three
scheduled there this year. To provide for expected larger
crowds in Johnston Gymnasium this year, arrangements
have been made to add 500 seats. (We wonder where

they’re going to find room.) Scott is also planning to vahine marke, see the
change. all of the seating on the east side of the gym into |" ofrensively, Threlkeld ac-

reserve seating.
What're they going to do when we become national
champions?

DAVIDSON OVER RICHMOND

Tomorrow’s game will be a critical one for the ’Cats,
determining whether they have a break-even season and
whether or not they will grace the bottom of the confer-
ence cellar this year.

For this reason we pick the ’Cats in an upset victory
over the Richmond Spiders. The 'Cats have the ability to
take this one, if they get mean. We think they will.

Davidson 20, Richmond 14.

The crystal ball sees a bad day for Southern Con-
ference teams. We pick them as follows:

Penn. State 34, West Virginia 20.

Wake Forest 21, VPI 7.

Clemson 30, Furman 7.

Memphis State 14, The Citadel 0.

Davidson’s Wildcat football-
ers close out their 1962 season
tomorrow against the Richmond
Spiders. The game will be play-
ed here, starting at 2 p.m.

This will be the ‘Cat's last
chance to come out with a break-
even season, taking a 341
record into the contest. The
Spiders claim a 43 overall
record.

The game will also be the
‘Cat squad’s last chance to es-

fcape from the conference cel-

ence record so far.

WON THREE STRAIGHT

The team that they're going
to have to beat to come out with
an even record is somewhat of a
Johnny-come-lately squad. The
Spiders dropped three of their
first four contests, and at that,
time didn't look like very stiff

came to life and bombed their
next three opponents, two of
them upset victories.

Three weeks ago the Spiders
started on the move by dropping
Boston U. to a loss. They fol-
lowed up with a surprise win
over Cincinnati, 21-20, and last
week they overpowered George
Washington, 17-14, for their
only conference win.

The biggest reason for Rich-
mond's comeback can be found
in the quarterback slot where

will have more depth and ex-
perience at each position than
any team we've had in recent
years.”

Returning lettermen on the
squad are Tom Wright, team
captain, Dick Wray, Billy Mills,
Russell Walls, and Tom Day.
Several sophomores will be fill-
ing key positions on the team.
They include Joe Parker, Mike
Bian, and David Walker.

Joe Jones, who didn’t wrestle
| jast year because of a neck in-
jury, should add strength to the
157 pound position.

The season for the matmen
will open on Dec. 1 against
Pfeiffer. A team from the 82nd
Airborne Division at Fort Bragg
will meet the ‘Cat matmen in
a practice match on Nov. 20.

At present five freshmen are
out for wrestling, with several
more expected out after foot-
‘ball is over. Parker is counting
heavily on freshmen Eric
Nichols, Johnny Webb and Jer-
ry Blackstock.

“BIG AND QUICK”

looks toward the, Richmond
game with little optomism. He
said, “They didn't get organized
antil midseason, but they’ve de-

They're big and quick.”

Speaking of John Hilton, he
said, “They've got a big end
that they throw to a lot. Rich-

one.”

Wildcats Close Season Against Richmond

Hurting Dole tomorrow will
be the same problem that has
plagued him all season, injur-
ed players. Back Pat Fisher is
only one of the players who will
see only limited action because
of injuries.

Dole isn’t planning many line-
up changes for tomorrow. He
will, however, be starting Earl
Cole at quarterback instead of
Kent Tucker, who started in the
"Cat's last two games.

14-7 FURMAN LOSS

loss to Furman, Dole had only
praise for most of the team,
particularly the interior line.

did a good job containing Fur-

sive ends—they couldn't control

With about two and half
minutes remaining in the over-
time period, wing Mac Nemir
set up a play and passed to
Schoen. Schoen, playing from
his center-forward position, took
the pass and kicked the ball past
the Pfeiffer goalie to provide
the Davidson team with its fifth
victory of the year. The team
has suffered two defeats.

“Schoen is one of our top

As center-forward, Schoen is
the Wildcats’ chief play maker.
His task is to spot weaknesses
in the opposition's defense, call
plays, and put them into opera-
tion.

idson booters with eight goals.
Schoen is also the workhorse of
the team. “He played the entire
Pfeiffer game without substitu-

quarter of every game this

Schoen, who Fogleman dub-

from Philadelphia and began
playing soccer at William Penn
Charter School, a prep school.
This is his second year as Dav-
idson’s regular center-forward.

Praising the team for its fine
play, Schoen commented. “The
team has worked hard this year
and it looks like we might have
the best record of any Davidson
soccer team. I hope this success
will give us the impetus needed
to encourage more people to
come out for soccer.”
