that the food makes them all
sick, but not this time.”’
Captain Jackie Hughes

said, ‘‘This is the biggest :

thing to happen at Davidson
since the dumpster fire last
term. We’ve quarantined the
entire campus and ordered
Dave Pritchett not to take his
team to Brown for the Satur-
day game. I hope the flu runs
its course by Christmas break
—I’d hate to keep the kids
here during vacation.”’

Only Director of Student
Housing Scotty Nicholls and
Physical Plant Director Gro-
ver C. Meetze Jr. expressed
disapproval of the plan to
emergency — innoculate the
students.

“What nobody here seems
to realize is that we just don’t
have enough space to give
every student a room for next
year. It would be too bad for
us to lose students to swine
flu, but somehow we've got to
get rid of two dozen people
before spring time,”’ they said.

The Davidson College fac-
ulty will soon be enhanced by
the addition of a new Political
Science teacher. Frontis John-
ston, Vice President for Aca-
demic Affairs, stated that
Gerald R. Ford, lame-duck
President of the United States
of America, would become an
Assistant Professor shortly
before the end of January and
would teach a full course load
spring term.

‘‘We feel that it is David-
son’s patriotic duty to help
smooth the transition period
as the Jimmy Carter cartel
assumes power. What better
way is there than to take a
load off Jerry’s mind than by
letting him know where he can
go after January 20?’’ John-
ston asked with a knowing
ghost of a smile.’

Johnston was most enthus-
iastic about Ford’s qualifica-
tions. ‘Look at his experience!
The man has more or less been
in charge of the most powerful
natin on the face of the earth,
so surely he can handle thirty
kids in a classroom, who don’t
give a damn about what he’s
saying. He should be used to
being ignored by now, any-

way. A man who can put
millions asleep nationwide by
TV has proven his worth to
our academic program.”

He continued, ‘‘And he’s
perfect for the political science
department here. | mean, my
God, he can’. be any more
boring than Minter or Jones.

‘We plan to let him teach
just 8 and 9 o'clock classes.
None could top him at coping
with killer courses like Con-
gress and the Presidency. I
figure he can maybe have a
sunrise seminar on Fear and
Loathing in Kansas City or
the Unmaking of the Presi-
dent, 1976,”’ he said.

President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. was pleased by John-
ston’s idea. Between serves he
yawned, ‘I’ve always liked
Jerry's style. The parallels
between him and myself are
staggering, don’t you think?
We both took office at crisis
points in the history of our
institutions, and we worked to
restore faith and trust.

This reporter then tapped
secret Davidsonian slush
funds to finance a junket to
Washington, D.C., for an
interview with the alleged
Ford. Between trips between

file cabinets and the shredder
he admitted that Davidson
was his next home. “‘I feel that
my work in life is just start-
ing. The past two years were
only the beginning; I got our
boys out of Vietnam and I can
get the dudes who sleep
through 8 o'clock classes into
the classroom.

“Carter was peanuts com-
pared to the challenge ahead of
me now. Hot diggity damn!”
He then clapped: his hands in
childish glee,@patted his belly
and rubbed his head and
tripped over a crack in the tile.

While regaining his feet he
stuck his thumb in an electri-
cal pencil sharpener. Recoiling
from that, the President not-
iced a shapely secretary pass-
ing by and acted as if to grab
at her breasts in a lecherous
effort to maintain his balance.

He slipped and fell headlong
into a garbage can full of used
mimeograph stencils. Some-
what blue in the face, he
commented as he tied his
shoelaces together, ‘I’ve
heard that you have to get up
pretty early in the morning to
top P. Min. Well, 8 o'clock
should do fine and after the
debates and all, I feel I’m as
ready as-I'll ever be.”
