in their third counter-guer-
rilla exercise of the year.

The maneuver will begin at
1430 hours (2:30 p.m.) Saturday
afternoon, when a_ helicopter
lifts the ‘Special Forces parti:
cipants from the soccer field to
the operations area. A truck
will also transport MS I's and
TI's to the scene of the exercise,
about fifteen miles southwest of
Davidson, where they will play
the part of a friendly ‘‘Viet-
namese™ village.

According to Tarby Bryant.
commander of the Davidson
Special Forces Unit. the opera-
tion will receive television cov-
erage and attention from both
Charlotte newspapers.

The situation will be that of
an area 100 miles behind Viet-
nam lines. The Special Forces
unit will try to locate and train
friendly ‘‘Vietnamese™ guer-
rillas (MS III's) and then with
their aid capture an enemy Viet
Cong supply dump. Before seiz-
ing this objective, the Special
Forces and the ‘‘Vietnamese”’
will attempt to ambush an
enemy ammunition truck neces-
sary for the success of the mis-
sion since it will contain C-ra-
tions and ammunition for M-1
rifles and machineguns.

Once they capture the truck.
the guerrillas will proceed to
the objective. which will be
guarded by the MS IV's and
some MS II's. If ‘the supply
dump is captured, then. both

the: Special Forces unit. (the
MS III's) and the enemy ‘“‘Viet-
namese’” (MS IV’s and II's)
will remain subject to attack -

tions.

In addition to Bryant, the of
ficers of the Davidson College
Special Forces Unit include
Sam Grimes. Executive Offi
cer: Fred Schoen. S-1: Steve
Ramsburgh. §.2: Mike Thur-
man, $3; and Chip Derrick.
S-4.

For the operation this week-
end, Ramsburgh wil! be the de-
tachment leader of the, Special
Forces group, with Steve Dav-
idson and Lanier Burns acting
as assistant detachment lead-
ers. Bryant will control the
enemy Viet Cong ammunition
truck and supply dump, while
Greg Govan will be in charge
of the objective.

More weapons will be used in
this weekend’s maneuver than
in any previous operation, and
will include three machineguns,
an artillery simulator, and trip
flares. Bryant said that tactics
used in capturing the objective
most likely will be partially
amphibious. since boats are
available for use in the opera.

area approximately fifteen
miles southwest of Davidson,
near the Catawba River. Bryant
described this area as having
“rough terrain, with briars and

Vietnam.” It is a good training
area. he said, since the vegeta-

that at Fort Bragg.

Succestul Shoe Salesman
To Address Business Club

Bartlette B. Walker, Ameri-
can Success Story Award recip-
ient-elect, will speak to an open
meeting of the Business Econo-
mics Association Tuesday at
7:30 p.m, in the Morrison Room
of the College Union.

Bill Canty. speaking for the
Association. said. ‘““Mr. Walker
will appeal even’ to those who
are. not business majors. He
was well received when he was
here last year. After I heard
him I wanted to run out and
buy stock in his company.”

Walker. an alumnus of Day-
idson. currently heads B. B.
Walker Shoe Company. Found-
ed in 1947 with $175 capital. this
firm today grosses over $9 mil-
lion annually. He started out
selling shoes to far-flung coun-
try stores in his spare time. His
first year’s sales were $1,756.

When the Free Enterprise
Awards Association named him
as one of their 10 recipients of
the American Success Story
Awards for 1964, they cited him
as “an example of success pos-
sible despite competition.” He

was also cited for his contribu-

tions to making workers’ shoes
more comfortable as well as
safe.

At the sixth grade level Wal-
ker began door-to-door selling.
This was necessitated by the
death of his father. Walker
worked his way through David-
son and earned a BS degree.

In World War II he served as
a Captain in the 79th Infantry
Division. In this capacity he
received the Silver Star, Bronze
Star. the Purple Heart, oak leaf
cluster. His unit was stationed
in France.

In 1956 Walker began to
manufacture his own shoes for
work and sport. Braving the
stiff competition of both the
domestic shoe trade and foreign
imports, his company grew
steadily.

Starting with a 3,200 square-
foot plant and a few workers.
Walker has expanded his -opera-
‘fon to a 175.000 square-foot
weration employing over 700
shoecrafters. In addition to
thece employees he has a truck

fleet capable of rapid delivery |;

anywhere in the United States.
He utilizes 46 full time sales-
men plus six sales managers.
The salesmen and managers
plus the wholesale outlets serv
ice 16.500 stores in all 50 states
and Puerto Rico.

Walker has always encourag
ed employees to invest in the
company, and today they own
over fifty per cent of the capital
stock. In hjs 16 years of opera-

stock Walker's employees are
in profit sharing programs and
other benefit programs.

Walker, a resident Asteboro,
is ‘a director ‘of the First Na-
tional Bank. of Asheboro, a
member of the Board of Direc-
tors of the National Show Manu-
facturers Association, and the
Davidson .College Board of
Visitors. In addition he is presi-
dent of both Seagrove Textile

Campus Lights Go Out

BY JIMMY WHITE

At 3:26 p.m. on Tuesday, a. power failure due
to arching in the electrical lines under Concord
Street caused the lights in the Library, Dana Science

Building, Martin Science Building, and Chambers
Building to go off.

Neither the engineer in charge of restoring the
power nor Grover Meetze, director of the physical
plant, knew the exact cause of: the failure; ‘but
Meetze did say that a similar power failure had been
produced by moisture in the conduit.

“There is a rumor that the failure was due to
uncertified electricians working on the switch-over
to the college sysiem, completed two weeks ago,”
said Meetze, “but all electricians in this operation
mere certified and supervised. by an engineering
irm.””

As for future emergencies, alternate routes are
available to provide power to the campus if power
is to remain off for more than twelve hours. The
Infirmary was not affected since it is supplied by the
town facilities. Power was restored around 11:25
p.m.
