. BOB GORDON

The primary job of the edi-
tor of Quips and Cranks, in my
4 opinion, is to compile into one
volume an integrated picture
and story of the spirit of David-
son. In formally accepting the
nomination for editor, I am
conscious of all responsibilities
connected with publishing a
successful yearbook.

and insure more co-operation
from each member of the staff.

Finally, in trying to present
an overall picture of campus
life, editors in the past have
neglected an emphasis on the
Senior Class. 1t is primarily
their book and an adequate
balance can be achieved here,
too. In accordance with this
policy, the! rising senior class
will have a part in the election

My past three years of ex-

my earnest endeavor to give the
Class of 1961, as well as David-

CHARLIE ROSE

Have you ever noticed the
personal attraction of Look
a Magazine or Sports Illustrated?
This attraction ,is the result of
carefully planned photographs
and layouts.

Our annual can have this
same attraction. To achieve this
an editor must begin with more
than a theme or central idea.
The backbone of any book is its
breakdown into sections (Fra-
ternities, etc.). Any theme is
lost if this skeleton of organiza-
tion does not make the theme
obvious to the reader,

I propose the creation of five
new sections in next year’s an-
nual. Four to be pictorial essays
h on the characteristics of each
class. Beginning with a picture &

For quite some time now
Seript ‘n’ Pranks has failed to
live up to this stated aim of
entertainment. I do not mean
to insinuate that this failure has
always been the fault of the
editor. It is very difficult for
one man to judge accurately
what will be entertaining for
nine hundred other men. Fur-
thermore, no editor can produce
an entertaining and humorous
magazine unless the material he
receives is of that nature.

Therefore, the fact that I
wish to produce a_ hilariously
entertaining Scripts ‘n’ Pranks
does not necessarily guarantee
that this will come about. My

“What kind of network

“it's the Military Affiliated

power generator drowned out
his last words. Tom Watts ad-

“If a boy goes to Europe, or,

“W4LMK, this is K4MHY,

“This radio club has just
unlimited possibilities,” add-
ed Adams. “There are twenty-
two members in the club,
over eight operators. We've
talked to boys from Clemson,
Duke, Wofford, and the Uni-
versity of Texas and made
contacts with the West Coast,
South America, and even into

trol which were worthwhile,
and give direct, constructive
leadership to individuals and to
the Freshman Council. The
spheres of the Student Council
and the Y, which is groaning
with an overload of responsibil-
ities, can be cooperatively eval-
uated with the idea of the Stu-
dent Council’s taking over some
of the duties which are per-
formed in the name of the
school as a whole. .
STANLEY: For the Council
to be effective in its newly or-
ganized role, the group must
act in areas that are not as well
.defined as were those of the old
Council. The somewhat nebu-
lous term, student-faculty link,
must be more concisely under-
stood and this definition must
be incorporated into the Coun-
cil’s work. Student body-Stu-
dent Council function would be
to encourage, publicize, and
schedule forums or chapel pres-
entations which would serve to
stir up interest in the students.
A second role could be the
registration and administration
of after-dance parties.

Body be one to give an accurate

3. Comment on the follow-
ing perennial “issues.”

(a) the drinking rule

(b) the court of control

BOOTLE: a. The drinking
rule should be left alone—loop-
holes and all.

b: The court of Control
serves a purpose if it helps only
a few members of the freshman
class; its effectiveness depends
upon the upperclassmen.

SHUE: a. My thinking on the
drinking rule is based on two
principles neither of which 1
hope will have to be sacrificed:
an alcohol-free campus and an
unhypocritical moral integrity
in regard to regulations. These
two principles lead me to con-
sider seriously the possibility
of amending Section 3 of the
Student Body Regulations’ to
read: “No student shall be guil-
ty of being under the influence
of alcoholic liquors while on the
campus except that a student
under the influence of alcohol
may return to his dormitory
room provided that he does not
cause any disturbance whatso-
ever.”

The big day for sports car enthusiasts!

It’s the Date of the Year—secing the sports cars of the world in a
day-and-night test of mettle for men and machines at Sebring!
Amoco, as usual, is the sponsor. And powerful, unleaded Amoco-Gas
—also as usual—is the sole fuel chosen for the spectacular performance
every driver expects to turn in.

Come on down! If you drive, come the smart drivers’ way. Stop at
Amoco stations en route. Fuel up with premium Amoco-Gas that
leaves no lead deposits on plugs, valves or combustion chambers—
saves overhaul costs. Or if you use regular, buy American, best of the
regulars because it’s precision-refined to burn clean.

See you at Sebring!
