COLUMBIA ACCEPTS
ROSE BOWL BID

Ha CASKIE NODVELL 32.

Once again the Davidson College
gridders proved that the Wake Forest
jinx is very definitely smashed, when
they took the Deacons into camp 20-13
in their annual Turkey Day classic.

Johnny Mackorell, again the cen-
ter of attraction, rode high, wide
and handsome to rout the Wake
boys. In addition, however, orchids
go to Jim Morgan, Captain Charlie

Rives, “Schnozz” Willson, Johnny

Siewers, and Henry Cathey, to say

nothing of “Little Joe” Wingfield.

That’s a mean array of them, and

we award still another to Pat

Swan, bulwark of the Deacon for-

ward wall.

A 50+yard pass from Mackorell to
Morgan, who was standing. in the end
zone, was the most spectacular play
of the afternoon. With the ball on
Wake Forest's 37-yard stripe, the bril-
liant Davidson field general took the
pass from center, faded Back to mid-
field, and tossed a beautiful spiral diag-
onally across the field to Morgan, who
caught it on the run in the end zone.

Now football is over, and- it~ is
with regret that we see four great

Wildcat fighters, Rives, McElrath,

Grant, and Willson, hang up the

Davidson moleskins for telathsTA

Davidson Moleskins for the last

time. These boys have fought hard

for the ’Cats, and they will be re-
membered for their part in one of

sons.

most successful sea-

Coming up to take their places are,
at center, Hugh Gracey, brother of
Vanderbilt’s All-American Pete Gracey,
who starred on the frosh this year,
and J. B. Lee,. sub-center this year,
and well-seasoned under fire; at the
guard that Rives leaves vacant, admir-
able material found in Hand and
Cathey, one or the other of whom may
be shifted there, so that John Newton
can show what he has at end, and
Coley Windham may go back to
tackle, his natural position . . . then
the fullback berth, held down so bril-
liantly by the dynamic “Schnozz”...
well, LeGare and Verble both look
good. This boy Yarborough should
show plenty of stuff, too... and just
watch this Quick from the freshman
team.

Our All-State appears in this is- :
sue, and we hope it suits every-
one. If it doesn’t, there’s nothing
we can do about it, as it was
picked on votes of seven sports
writers, and everyone was treated
fairly, with personal sentiment cast
aside. We were pleased to notice
that the Associated Press men-
tioned Johnny Mackorell for All-
American at a halfback post. He
was unanimously picked on every
All-State team, while Jim Morgan,
Charlie Rives, and George Wing-

is

field got d team selections, as
Percy McElrath got honorable
mention.

The great Duke eleven had the mis-
fortune to bow to Georgia Tech, 6-0,
in their last game, thereby ruining a
perfect season. Too bad Blue
Devils . . . this column pulled for you
for the Rose Bowl, and believes you
would have gotten the bid, had you
gotten by the Ramblin’ Wrecks. Notre
Dame unceremoniously bumped the
hitherto undefeated Army eleven, 13-12,
to crash them from their pinnacle.
Princeton has the best claim to the
mythical title, licking Yale, 27-2, for a
perfect season, with no defeats and no
ties. They say they will not consider
a Rose Bowl bid. North Carolina
scored twice in the final canto to de-
feat its ancient rival, Virginia, 14-0, in
their annual Thanksgiving game. Fur-
man rose in its mighty ire, and downed
Clemson, 6-0, in a Palmetto State
classic. Southern California’s Trojans
couldn't. be denied, and licked the
potent Georgia Bulldogs, 31-0. It looks
bad for the East. New Year’s Day.
Auburn, stormy petrel of the South-
eastern Conference, ventured into the
Southern, only to meet defeat at the
hands of Billy Laval’s South Carolina
Gamecocks, under the leadership of
the brilliant Earl Clary, 16-14.

DAVIDSONIAN’S
ALL-STATE TEAM
IS MADE PUBLIC

Mackorell Is Chosen for All-State
Team by Unanimous Vote

CRAWFORD ALL-AMERICAN

Rives and Morgan of Davidson
Also Named

By CASKIE NORVELL, JR.

As has been its custom in the past,
“The Davidsonian,” through its sports
editor, now makes public its annual
All-State football selection. The 1933
picks are, we think, up to the usual
high calibre that has marked the
choices of this paper in the past.

The 1933 All-North Carolina eleven
is a powerful organization, the line
averaging 191 pounds from end to end,
and the pony backfield attaining an
average weight of 184 pounds. This
is a mighty eleven for any team to
have to go up against, and was picked
largely on performance against David-
son,

A change in the picking system was’

made this year. Inthe past the sports
editor picked the team on his own
personal opinion, but this season, the
sports editor asked the alumni secre-
tary, Grier Martin, Odi Casali, and
four sports reporters, Lamont Brown,
Addison Brenizer, Harvey Glass, and
Paul Harlan, to pick teams in addi-
tion to his own. Each man chose a
first, second and third team. A first
team selection meant five votes for a
player, a second team three votes, and
a third team one vote. From these
statistics three teams and an honor-
able mention list have been gotten up.

On the flanks are found two great
wingmen in Tom Rogers, sensational
170-pounder from Duke, and David-
son’s mighty “Big Jim” Morgan, who
showed the dirt of many a stadium to
some highly-touted backs of the oppo-
sition. He rose to his greatest heights
against Wake Forest in the annual
Turkey Day classic. He is fast, ag-
gressive, and is death to safety men
returning punts.

Earl Wentz polled 19 votes, to place
the versatile Duke flankman on the
second team, along with Raymond
Redding of N. C. State, who played

such a bang-up game against David-*

son. Carolina’s Brandt was just be-
hind Redding “in the balloting, and
Swing of Wake Forest was selected
to be his running mate on the third
team, beating out Rossiter of Duke by
one vote.

At the tackles, no one can deny that
the pickers did the best
Duke’s All-American lineman, Freddie
Crawford, and Wake Forest’s man-
mountain, Pat Swan, were outstand-
ing, and were unanimous choices of
the pickers. Crawford is a demon in
the line, and was generally conceded
a place, his play against Tennessee be-
ing particularly outstanding. Swan, a
junior, weighs 235 pounds, and is the
sparkplug of the Wake team. His
greatest game was against Clemson in
Charlotte.

possible.

Durner, Crawford’s brilliant running
mate, made second team in a walk, and
Tatum of Carolina got 15 votes to get
on this eleven, Third team honors
went to Siewers, of Davidson, and
Daniels, of Carolina, who saw action
both at center and tackle. Pee

The hottest race was for the guards,
after Barclay, Tar Heel ace, had gar-
nered one of them unanimously.
Charlie Rives, Davidson; Mutt DeAn-
gelis, picked last year by this paper,
Wake Forest, and Carl Schock, Duke,
waged a mean battle, with the David-
son captain finally winning out with
25 votes to 20 for DeAngelis. “Barclay,
who made third team All-American,
is one of the best guards ever to play
for the Chapel Hill institution, and
took in all 35 votes. Rives, a repeater
from last year, played consistently all
season, and despite a knee operation,
showed up brilliantly.

Second team honors go to Mutt De-
Angelis, Wake Forest, and Captain
Carl Schock of the mighty Blue Devils,
who beat out State’s Stanko by four
votes. Potter, steady Wildcat guard,
was. placed on the third team as
Stanko’s running mate.

Another unanimous choice was the
pivot post, where every ballot was
cast for that brilliant center, E. B.
Dunlap, of Duke, who last week was
awarded a place on this paper’s All-
South Atlantic eleven. He. is a fine
center, both offensively and defensive-
ly, and undoubtedly deserves this post.
Other centers receiving mention were
Sabol, Wolfpack sophomore, and®

Percy McElrath, alternate captain at

ond and third teams, respectively. No
other centers were mentioned.

The backfield was pretty well sewed
up, only one man failing to get at
least thirty votes. North Carolina’s
greatest backfield man, Johnny Mack-
orell, the flash from Davidson, was a
unanimous choice for the quarterback
job. The brilliant Davidson field gen-
eral, who created offensive pyrotech-
nics all séason, could not be denied,
and he was given the vote of every
man doing the picking. Mackorell, in
his junior year, played brilliant ball,
calling signals like a veteran, hitting
the line like a fullback, running in the
open like a halfback, and blocking like
a lineman. His defensive work was
excellent.

Horace “Horse” Hendrickson, Duke
field general, garnered 16 votes, and
was placed on the second team over
Ed “Pepper” Martin, North Carolina’s
brilliant kicker, whose booming punts
kept Davidson at bay. Bob McQuage,
N. C. State, received six votes for
quarterback, but as he bagged 24 for
halfback, he was awarded this position
on the first team.

With McQuage, a brilliant: runner
and drop-kicker, already at one half-
back, the other was a simple matter,
as the Devils’ brilliant Corky Cornelius,
who scored all Duke points against the
Vols, barely missed being a unanimous

COLUMBIA GETS
ROSE BOWL BID

Lions Chosen by Stanford Over
Army, Duke, and Nebraska

After much speculation, the Lions
of Columbia University, New York
City, have been awatded the Rose
Bowl bid by Stanford University, the
western representative. Columbia au-
thorities signified their intention of ac-
cepting, according to a radio announce-
ment made just before this paper went
to press.

The announcement came as a sur-
prise to most, as Columbia was de-
cisively defeated by Princeton, and
plays a rather unrepresentative sched-
ule in addition. However, this will be
the east’s representative, as the Stan-
ford team had the privilege of picking
its opponent.

The Cardinals got the right to rep-
resent the west by virtue of victories
over Southern California and Cali-
fornia, although they were tied for the
Pacific Coast title by the University of
Oregon.

Army was supposed to have had the
inside track, until they were surpris-
ingly defeated by Hunk Anderson's
Notre Dame Ramblers, 13-12. With
Army out of the way, Duke was rated
next in line forsthe bid, but Wallace
bowed to Tech, 6-0. With
these two great teams now numbered
among the defeated, there was specu-
lation as to who would get the bid,
and many thought it should go to
Coach X. Bible's Nebraska
Cornhuskers, who were champions of
the Big Six.

Georgia

Dana

Princeton, the country’s only unde-
feated and untied major eleven, an-

nounced last week that due to an
agreement with Yale against post-sea-
son games, they would not accept,

should the bid be tendered them.

Columbia's claim is based on the fol-
lowing record:

Columbia 39—Lehigh 0,
Columbia 15—Virginia 6.
Columbia O—Princeton 20.
Columbia 33—Penn State 0,
Columbia” 9=Cortiel 6:
Columbia 14—Navy 7.
Columbia 46—LaFayette 6,

Columbia 16—Syracuse 0,

A species of fly said to be unique
on this continent has been found on
the campus of Fordham University and
is being carefully studied by biology
students at the university.

Columbia’s tradition ghost, who
haunts the tunnels and halls of the col-
lege dorms, made its appearance to
members of the Freshman class in
John Jay Lounge the other night.

Chances for Bowl Game

Caroliftia Wins Thanksgiving
Game From Virginia, 14-0

V. M. I. 0; V. P. 1.0

William and Mary Defeats Rich-
mond University, 6-0

In a week-end filled with surprises
and upsets, Davidson's 1933 opponents
finished the football season Saturday,
as Duke lost more than just a game
to Georgia Tech, while other teams
found varying fortune in their Turkey
Day battles. é
In their traditional Thanksgiving
Day classic, the Carolina Tar Heels
came out of a deadlock in the fourth
quarter, and punched out two suc-
cessive touchdowns to down the stub-
born Virginia Cavaliers, 14 to 0. The »
North Carolina boys outplayed their
opponents practically throughout the
game, but seemed to lack the final
scoring punch until a tense last period.
The Citadel, threatened by a strength-
ened Wofford ‘eleven, in the end tri-
umphed over their foes by a two-
touchdown margin, 14 to 0, as the
Wofford threats failed to materialize
into actual scores.

V. M. I. showed unforeseen strength
Thursday to hold the favored V. P. I.
Gobblers to a scoreless tie, actually
the Tech goal seriously
once, and outplaying their opponents
in most of the game. V. P. I. never
threatened seriously.

William and Mary, expected to lose
in their classic Thanksgiving Day bat-
tle with the University of Richmond,
came out of the heap with a Spider
scalp hanging from their belt, and a
6-0 victory to show to the homefolks.
