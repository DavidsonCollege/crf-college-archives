If an economics student is in a forest
when a tree falls, does he or she make a sound?

“Political Economy of the Environment” class studies the phenomenon of clear cutting

By DAVID SCOTT

Professor Chris Bell of the eco-
nomics department has taught a
new class this term entitled “The
Political Economy of the Environ-
ment.” This class emphasizes the
vital role of proper management
techniques in order to preserve our
oft-abused natural resources.

On March 13 Bell led the eight
members of his class to the home
of Walton Smith (Davidson class
of ’32) to examine different for-
estry management principles in
action. Smith lives on 125 acres in
the Waldee Forest in southwest
North Carolina near the Great
Smokey Mountains National
Park. He is an active opponent of
federal forestry programs that in-
stitute the practice of clear cutting
in Carolina woodlands

Clear cutting is a frequently
applied tactic that involves cutting
down all trees and vegetation in a
section of forest, picking out the
usable timber, and leaving the rest
to decay. Government officials

claim that this practice provides a
simple way to obtain needed tim-
ber without hurting the environ-
ment. The cleared sections of for-
est, in theory, should grow back as
healthy or healthier than they were
before.

Environmental activists such as
Smith disagree. He and another
Davidson graduate, Monroe
Gilmore (Class of 68), along with
retired forester Bob Badgett,
spoke to the visiting students
about the advantages of selective
cutting over clear cutting. This
method inyolves marking each
tree that needs to be cut and leav-
ing the forest as a whole relatively
unchanged. The government
claims that this method is ineffi-
cient and expensive, but environ-
mental impact studies make this
point debatable.

The students then toured
Smith’s property on which the
method of selective cutting is put
into practice. On his property
Smith grows Christmas trees, has

Posters scream “Waiting for WALT,”
banners with the same message flap from
windows, ads tote the same news. All the
fuss begs an answer to a single question:
“Who IS WALT?”

WALT is the student radio station due to
begin broadcasting Monday, April 3. It
stands for alternative radio and will be found
on AM frequency 580. In addition to pro-
viding music notusually heard on major sta-
tions, WALT. will supply a unique form of
communication for the student body. Varied
programming as well as information about
on-campus events will make WALT a sta-
tion for all students.

The need for a student radio station arose
in September 1987. The administration
cancelled Flipsides, the last alternative
show broadcast on formerly student-run
WDAV. Asaresult, students rose in protest.
A petition for a student-run radio station
gathered signatures from over half the stu-
dent body a mere hour after its circulation.
Acting-on this overwhelming response,
Tyler Smith, Frank Lord and Kevin Dunn,
among others, soon obtained a charter for a
carrier current station from the SGA.

The charater made WALT elegible for
funds through the Activities Tax Council. In
addition, the new organization also became
part of the Media Board. Describing sta-
tion’s first stages, program director Lord

Wait no more! WALT be gins Monday

said, “it took a long time to do things I
thought would go a lot faster.” Smith, busi-
ness manager for WALT, stressed the
enormous amount of behind the scenes
paper work and organization required to set
the new station on it’s feet. She also com-
mented that the students recieved a lot of
help from the media board in addition to
securing use of old WDAV equipment. ~
During this school year, WALT staff
members have been working with the media
board to arrange for a broadcast studio and
engineers to revitalize the old system. The
studio in the basement of Belk required an
enormous cleanup effort. Drew Henderson.
and Kurt Perkins built shelves, laid carpet
and sound-proofed the old broadcasting

room. Fortunately, much of WDAV’s old
equipment still remained in the basement
and only required the efforts of Mac Wiley,
a WRFX engineer, to be operable. The huge
record collection also had to be transported
from the current WDAV offices. As part of
the last effort, music director Frank Lord,
found DJ’s and began compiling a list of

ngs which would be played on WALT.

Although at first the station will only be
carried in Duke, Cannon, Sentelle, Watts,
Little, Belk and Richardson, Smith hopes to
extend the area to include the union and
possibly the court houses. If enthusiam for
WALT grows, it could become available to
all students as an FM station sometime next
year.

Davidson drama presents
Wonderful Town this weekend

By KATHERINE MALLORY
The Davidson drama department will
present its first major musical since 1979 at

Love Auditorium April 7-9, 13-15. Won-

derful Town is a delightful tale based on a
series of stories by Ruth McKenney and put
to the music of Leonard Bernstein.

It is the story of Ruth McKenney’s zany
experiences with her sister Eileen, two
midwesterners who have come to.

Greenwich Village in 1935 to build their
lives. Ruth, played by senior Donna Peters,
is the older sister. Eileen, played by junior
Trina Janiec, is a somewhat naive but beau-
dfnl younger sistas, :

The parade of people and events in the
lives of the sisters reflects the chaos of life in
