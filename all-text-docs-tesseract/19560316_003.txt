Friday at Wofford |

When the Davidson netmen)
travel to Spartanburg, S. C Friday |
to meet Wofford, it will mark the
beginning of a new era in David-
son tennis. With only one (1)
letterman returning, John Robin-
son, the ‘Cats will have a hard
row to hoe, facing some of the top
teams in the country.

Coach McKee says however, that
the team should perform better
as the season progresses and the
players become more experienced.
He also has high expectations of
keeping the Conference Title but
expects tough competition from
W&M and Richmond.

Coach McKee has not decided
who will play what position yet
but says that Robinson, Dave
Pearshall, Semi Mintz, and Bob
Huffaker will definitely make the
trips’ to Wofford and Furman,
whom the 'Cats play on Saturday.

Wofford has three (3) returning
lettermen, headed by Dale Warner,
