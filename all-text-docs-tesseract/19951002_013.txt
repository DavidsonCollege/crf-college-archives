Soccer plays well, but suffers three defeats

UNCC, Furman, and Duke

frustrate the Wildcats in close games (hy

By WILL BRADSHAW

Rival UNCC — invaded
Richardson Field Sunday and was
able to escape with a 2-1 victory
over the Cats.

MEN’S SOCCER

The first half was controlled
by the 49ers, who tallied seven
shots and three corner kicks in the
opening period, compared to two
shots and zerocorners for the Wild-
cats, but neither team was able to
score. In the second half, tough,
the 49ers scored two quick goals to
take a commanding lead.

WIth four minutes 52 seconds
remaining in the game, midfielder
Ian O’Brien pulled the Wildcats
within a goal off a crossing pass
from Nick Troiano. That started a
furious rally to knot the score, but
UNCC was able to foil those op-
portunities and grab the win.

Earlier in the week, the Wild-
cats played third-ranked Duke on
Wednesday and conference rival
Furman on Friday in their first two
home games of the year. Davidson
took early leads in both contests,
but both Furman and Duke: were
able to claw back into a tie and
score late goals as each took wins,
also by the score of 2-1.

“We should have beat Duke,”
said Rob Ukrop, former Davidson
star and 1992 player of the year
who was in town. “The opportu-
nity was there, and We were a little
unlucky. (Robert) Clarke (the jun-
ior forward who leads the nation in
goals scored) had a couple good
chances. The next time he’Il stick
those in the back of the net.”

With 58 seconds left in the
first half against Duke, Clarke re-
ceived the ball after two quick
passes from junior forward/
midfielder Bryce Jewett and junior
striker Dennis Buck. Clarke bur-
ied the ball into the lower left side
of the net from about 16 yards out,
putting Davidson up 1-0. Duke got

the equalizer with 25:41 remain-
ing when Brian Kelly, a junior
midfielder for the Blue Devils,
broke through Davidson’s defense
and chipped the ball past diving
goalie Alex Deegan.

Duke freshman Josh
Henderson got the game-winning
goal after Davidson was unable to
clear the ball. The opportunity came
on a counterattack by Duke, after
Davidson barely missed scoring
the winning goal itself. The Blue
Devils outshot Davidson 15 to 14
for the game, but 11 of the Blue
Devils shots came in the second
half.

“T really thought we played
well against Duke,” coach Charlie
Slagle said. “We did what we
needed to do to win, and it was
clear that whoever scored that third
goal was going to win. Duke did
what it took.”

Slagle was notas pleased with
the Wildcats in Friday’s game
against Furman, saying that at the
beginning, effort was lacking.

“We have to make things hap-
pen, and we didn’t do that (Fri-
day),” he said. “It would have put
us in the driver’s seat for the con-
ference championship at 4-0. Now
we have to look within ourselves
and see why we didn’t win.”

Phil Julien put Davidson ahead
with 17:46 remaining in the first
half when his header off Ryan
Northington’s corner kick beat the
Furman goalie. The Paladins knot-
ted the score with 6:10 left in the
half when Furman quickly coun-
tered a Davidson attack and ended
up with a numbers advantage that
Bubba Self converted into a goal.
No one scored again until Brian
Nickerson got the game winner
with 2:59 remaining in overtime.

“It was a good hard fought
game,” Furman coach Davy
Allison said. “Both teams played
great. (The Wildcats) had some
tough losses they could have won,
so they’re doing a lot of things
right. The luck has got to change
for them.”

Against Duke, Clarke took six
of the 14 Davidson shots, convert-
ing one into a goal, but Furman
kept the marking on him much

tighter and only allowed him a
couple good chances.

“Furman respects Clarke as a
goal scorer,” Ukrop said. “(The
Paladins) know that the guy who is
going to put the ball in the back of
the net for Davidson is Robert. The
Duke mentality is that if he doesn’t
play for us then he can’t be that
good. What you’re going to see in
the future is (Clarke) will create

chances for other people.”

Allison mentioned Clarke as
one of their concerns, but also said
he wanted his team to keep the
pressure on Davidson.

“Deegan has been a pillar of
strength for them for a number of
years, and Clarke is always dan-
gerous,” Allison said. “He has
scored many goals. We wanted to
keep it wide and get it around the

back, which we did several times,”
Allison said.

Deegan had 12 saves in the
three games, giving the Wildcats
the opportunity to win them all.

Julien suffered an injury
against Furman and was notable to
continue play. It is unclear, Slagle
said, when he will return. He did
not dress for Sunday’s game, but
was on the bench with the team.

Wildcats lose heartbreaker i in last seconds to Guilford

By MICHAEL KRUSE

GREENSBORO — It began
so auspiciously. Shreve Ariail
scooped up a fumble on Guilford’s
second offensive play and lum-
bered 57 yards for the early lead.

FOOTBALL

Tommy Dugan’s quarterback
keeper gave the Wildcats an as-
tounding 13-0 lead not even six

minutes in.

But as Quakers kicker Chris
Meehl’s field goal split the up-
rights with no time remaining, earn-
ing Guilford (2-1) an emotional
31-28 triumph, Davidson (1-3) felt
the sting of defeat for the third
straight Saturday, this being per-
haps the hardest loss of all.

Although on the losing end,
Davidson did play well. After last
week’s shutout at Emory & Henry,
the Wildcats offense recovered
admirably. Its 22 first downs more
than doubled last week’s output of
10.

Freshman tailback Lorenzo

Moll continued his steady produc-
tion, collecting 61 yards on 16 car-
ries and scoring ona 10-yard screen
pass from Dugan.

Big freshman tight end Wes
Jones emerged as one of the top
Davidson receivers with four
catches for 48 yards.

And the Wildcats attack reg-
istered a total team effort in an
impressive, 18-play, 77-yard touch-
down drive. Mike Cowles’s 4-yd
scoring reception completed the
methodic drive and tied the game
at 28 with 13:29 to play.

The Davidson defense was
strong as usual, but again over-

worked (Guilford ran 77 plays to
Davidson’s 62) and victimized by
poor field position.

Captain James Cassidy played
well again, accumulating 12 tack-
les, 10 unassisted. The dominant
senior lineman also collected three
sacks, running his career total to
19.5, a new Davidson record.

After the game, coach Tim
Landis voiced strong feelings about
Cassidy: “There’s not a harder
working kid (and) there’s not a
single person who exemplifies a
Davidson College football player
more so than James.”

Freshman Ben Spivey also

continues to impress, playing an
integral role on the defensive front
despite being undersized for his
position.

“Spivey has more raw poten-
tial than any defensive lineman to
come here ina while. ... Ben’s not
just going to be a good player, he
already is,” declared Landis.

Other key Wildcats defenders
were captains Bo Bartholemew (11
tackles) and Will Robinson (eight),
Dan Dearing (nine), Chris Hess
(eight), and Kevin Graham (six).

There is no denying that the
