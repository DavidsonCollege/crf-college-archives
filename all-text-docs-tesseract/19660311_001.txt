INew Regulations Court

A proposal to create a Stu-

having investigative and judicial
control over Student Body Reg-
ulations was approved by the
Student Council Monday night.

Jim Stokes, Honor Court chair-
man, outlined the proposal which
would. alleviate the Honor
Court's respnsibility over Stu-
dent Body Regulations. In effect
it would result in a divorce
of responsibility, with the Honor
Court's responsibility over Stu-
over honor violations and the
Student Council having the pow-
er to try Student Body Regula-
tions offenses and seeing that
they are enforced.

Stokes stated that ideally, the
proposed Court would be com-
posed of five members of the
Student Council. The structure
of a five-man Court would prob-
ably be a group of three class

clarifying and voicing student
opinion.

As a news medium, straight
news stories should be supple-
mented by more analytic type
stories, which go beyond the
basic facts to the story behind
the story. Interviews with stu-
dent officers, faculty and admin-
istration can point out areas
which need study or change.

THE DAVIDSONIAN has been
continually criticized for a lack
of coverage of news whose sig-
nificance transcends the cam-
pus. The problem is complicat-
ed by the impossibllity of topping
the coverage of wire services
and weekly news magazines with
staffs of hundreds to cover na-
tlonal and international news.

The solution I propose is to
present stories which go beyond
the campus, yet have a local
angie. Visiting speakers offer
excellent opportunities for stor-
ies in Which the speaker talks
on significant issues — stories
which go beyond the visitor's
chapel talk to ‘‘in-depth’”’ inter-
views.

philosophy that I shall make if

—Although the paper has been
increased in size in the last
two years there has been no cor-
responding reorganization of
staff. I would add several new
staff members. including a copy
reader for the sports desk and
additional help for the manag-
ing editors and news editor:
and reorganize the Wednesday
lay-out session so as to save
much of the time that is wast-
ed now.

~I would improve the cali-
ber of the copy through regular-
ly planned sessions of instruc-
tion in style and organization for
writers.

—A schedule of coming events
at Davidson will be printed in
the paper. Also, I plan a cal-
endar of noteworthy cultural,
academic and social events on

- other campuses and in surround-

ing cities.

ond summer working for a daily news-

for ideas and a forum of stu:
dent opinion. This will be im-
plemented through a more criti-
cal editorial philosophy with the
alm of accurately delineating is-
sues by decisive stands.

—Finally, I plan to broaden
the scope of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN beyond the town and cam-
pus through news and feature
stories on outside items of inter-
est, contributions on the mean-
ing of national events to the
Davidson community and cover-
age of sports events other than
those in which Davidson partici-
pates.

‘Bill Council, student council
president, stated, ‘‘the proposal
is nothing totally new, but re-
sults from a self-evaluation of
Honor Court procedures and du-
ties."

The discussion over the pro
posed Court concluded with the
Council declaring their support
for the new system, but leav-
ing any definite changes for the
incoming Council, which will
take office next month.

Stokes also proposed two
changes in methods of choosing
Honor Court officers. First,
Stokes advocated that the per-
manent chairman and recorder
be elected by members of both
the incumbent and newly-elected
Court. Acaording to Stokes,

JIM STOKES

“this could make the Honor
Court better co-ordinated, with
the incoming members having a
voice in who should be the chair-
man.”’ Stokes’ proposal was
adopted by the Council by an
amendment to the by-laws.

In addition, the Council adopt-
ed Stokes’ proposal to Jet newly-
elected Court members run for
Honor Court offices. Stokes felt
that newly-elected members
may sometimes be better to rep-
resent the feelings of the stu-
dent body, which is important
in presenting the honor system
to the incoming freshmen. These
changes necessitated an amend-
ment of the By-Laws which for-
merly read:

“The permanent chairman of

the Honor Court: shall be a sen-
ior on the Court and elected
by members of the incumbent
court. Those seniors on the in-
cumbent court will indicate their
willingness to run for the office
by filing with the presiding
chairman.”

The Council also passed a
statement voicing its endorse-
ment of the National Student
Association (NSA). The state-
ment reads, ‘‘The Student Coun-
cil strongly favors continued af-
filiation with NSA.” The state-
ment stresses that the NSA at
Davidson is not affiliated with
or influenced by political stands,
but retains the benefits of NSA
affiliation at a low cost ($60
annually).

The four benefits enumerated
in the statement were a sum-
mer scholarship program simi-
lar to the one Davidson junior
George Brown received last year
to study in the Far East, low
cost travel advantages. depend-
able student insurance and a
good basis for interscholastic
contacts.

The day for the student body
referendum determining future
NSA affiliation was set for
Thursday.

Lee Fanning announced that
two extra Honor Court positions
would be open in the upcoming
elections, one in both the rising
junior and senior classes. These
changes were necessary because
junior Kem Anderson has re-
signed from the Court and soph-

omore Bob Finlayson plans to
participate in the Junior Year

Abroad Program in Germany.

Plans for the upcoming Men’s
Student Government Associa-

tion meeting at Duke, to be held
April 10-16, were announced by
John Gresham. The purpose of
the meetings will be primarily
to provide an exchange of ideas
and programs between students
and student leaders from differ-
ent schools.

Other schools participating
will be Princeton, Howard, Van-
derbilt and possibly Oberlin and
Antioch. Any student wishing
to participate in the program,

which would necessitate cutting

a week's classes, should go by
Gresham's room.
