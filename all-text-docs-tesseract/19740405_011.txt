C.A. and Y.B. Flame On Again
Despite Alarming Lack Of Facts

Due to reasons beyond our
control, we cannot give many
of the IMAC softball scores
this week.

The fools that are in charge
of IMAC locked the IMAC of-
fice, an unprecedented move,
and we're unable to find a key.
Live and learn, I guess.

Anyhow, over in Division I,
mass confusion reigns. The
early leader Vatican II took a
serious drubbing at the hands
of C-V. Both teams stand at 2-
1.

Also in contention are the

3M comapny and 4th East (we
thought they changed the
name of the dorm to Sen-
telle).

Bringing up the rear at 0-2 is
KA#2. The surprise leader at

this point is a freshman team.
Richardson II.

In Division II, the pride of
the south, KA#1 stands alone
at the top with a 24 record.
Bob Cunningham and Buck
Farrow led the way for Barley
Hay and Alfalfa.

the division is the always

The Davidson rugby club sponsored a tournament this
weekend and the ation was anything but mild. Carolina emerged
victorious with Davidson placing second.

"Heel Ruggers Scourge

Tournament Contender

By ANN BODE
Staff Writer
Carolina’s rugby
emerged victorious in the first
Davidson Invitational Rugby
Tournament. The _ tour-
nament’s three other con-
tenders, Davidson, Charlotte,
and Davidson Renegades,
took second, third, and fourth
places respectively.
The championship game
between Carolina and David-

of rugby. The match became
dominated early in the first
half of the game by the David-

club

_.matehonSaturday.

Wildcat Ruggers scorea on-
ce more before the half when
Marty Williamson kicked a
three point penalty kick. By
the end of the first half, David-
son was upsetting Carolina 7-
3.

Carolina came storming
back on the field from the half
ready to score. They suc-
ceeded within five minutes
with a hard fought try and a
successful extra point kick.

Davidson then tightened and

allowed no more scoring, but.

never regained their for-
ceful spark of the first half and
failed to score again.
With a 9-7 edge over David-
cup given as a trophy in the
Davidson tournament.
The Tar eae ts
iously won the right to
ag Davidson in a hard-
hitting but lopsided game
against Charlotte. Though

Chapel Hill was with
injuries, they defeated
Charlotte 30-16.

Davidson ruggers travel to
Charleston this week

for a

tough Gozinyas. The warm
weather has not hurt their
ability to drink brew, but z
has been suspected that
drinking brew hurts their
ability to play softball. Look
for them to sober up in time
for the tournament.

The SPE's stand even at 1-1
while the rest of the pack.
PDT=1. the hapless ATO’s and
Sticks are all looking for their
first win.

Division III's powerhouse
looks to be the Ragin Cajun s
from Arcadia. The Cajuns
feature Randy Wagner. Tom
Verlin. Juan Lanchey and the
Big E himself

The other contender 1:
Division III figures to be lasz
year's defending champs the
Kerwood Derbie. The Derbie
has been hit hak@® by gradua-
tion. but still has some fine
players in Allen Duncan. Doug
Eye and Jeff Hesiop

Phi Delt 3:2 and C-IV are
deadlocked at 1-1 while C-1ane
Beaver are iocked in the
basement. Beaver's kind of a
quaint name though

The race in Division IV is
looking like a two way affair
between the MGs and
Emanon. Both are tied at 2+)
with Emanon looking a ittle
better at this point

The no-names have the
redoubtable Calvin Allen and
a cast of thousands The MG s

SAE#1 stands alone at 1-1
while PDT#2. PGD#1 and the

We only wish that the Staten
Isiand Faimes had survived so

they could have played in this
The Cannoneers could be the
sleeper in this tough division.
The rest of the crew looks pret-
ty seedy. all of them are
without wins. The SPE’s. the

include the Vanilla Fudge. the
Kerwood Derbies. the SPE’s
and BCA#2.

Once again we apologue for
our lack of mformation. we'll
get some scores next week. Be
