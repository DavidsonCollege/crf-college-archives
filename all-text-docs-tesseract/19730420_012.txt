electricians and plumbers, are

heavy work load."’

When asked about the type of
housing that would be con-
structed, Baker said that it was
‘a design, which the best way to
describe would be that it was
oriented to the college.”

Baker described it as ‘‘a very
medium priced project with as
much quality as we can get into
it.”

Baker, in describing the
facilities which would be in-
cluded in the apartment com-
plex, mentioned ‘‘town house
design units with built-in kit-
chens, a central laundry for
those who want to use it, and a
swimming pool.”

As to the larger Phase II
apartments, Baker said that the
firm would ‘‘naturally rent to
anybody who wanted to buy.
Our tentative plans are that the
larger apartments’ would
probably cater to working
families who would naturally
pay more for them.”

In answer to whether there
had been any criticism from
people concerning possible
disruption of the lake en-
vironment over the building,
Baker indicated that there had
been ‘‘none as yet; I don't know
why there should be either.

“We don't plan on doing
anything to the lake. Besides, I
understand that that part of
LakeNorman is __ polluted
anyway, he said.

Robert A. Currie, college
business manager, agreed with
Baker's statement on the com-
pany's extended optimism.

It looks as though the (Ob-
server) article was a little too
premature,” Currie said.

“Concerning the construction

completion of a feasibility study
and arrangements for finan-
cing’ as he (Baker) says in the
article, well to me that's really
saying nothing, and from the

appearance of the article, it
looks like they're a long way
from doing this,"’ he said.
Currie did agree wholehear-
tedly that the housing project

Currie said.

When asked of his feelings on
the building, President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. indicated that he
and Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David Cor-
nell ‘‘knew nothing more about
the project than what had been
written in the newspaper.”
