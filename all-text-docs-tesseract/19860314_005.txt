Don’t call the Ghostbusters

By MARK CHEN

Ghostbusters ranks among the
most popular movies of all time. It
was the biggest grossing movie of
the 1984 summer season. The
song “Ghostbusters” became a top
ten hit on the pop charts.
Ghostbusters T-shirts were every-
where and the Republicans, in
order to cash in on the popularity
of the movie, put out a “Fritzbus-
ters” T-shirt. Bill Murray’s asking
price pér movie sky-rocketed
beyond the range of Earthbound
astronomers.

Two of my friends thought the
movie was hilarious. Whenever I
mentioned this week that
Ghostbusters was going to be
shown at Davidson, people im-
1 ediately said that they would
have to see it. By all the standards
of democracy and consensus,
Ghostbusters is one of the best
comedies of all time.

Which means that this re-

viewer is in a very small minority.

I saw Ghostbusters the sum-
mer when it was released. Every-
one told me how hilarious the
movie was and to look out for the
performance of Bill Murray. Mur-
ray, they told me, was the best
part of a very funny movie. Fol-
lowing their advice, I put down
my four dollars for a ticket, sat
down in the dark and waited .to
ache with laughter. I waited,
waited, and waited. I was still
wondering what the fuss was all
about after the movie ended.

To me Ghostbusters simply
rambled from skit to skit, grab-
bing comedy ideas like a desper-
ate improvisational act, and then
wasting what good ideas it had.
This opinion did not change after I
reviewed the movie once again
this week. A second viewing only
showed even more wasted oppor-
tunities for a really good comedy.

Murray is at the heart of the

Elvis Costello returns

By LEE EICHELBERGER

It is refreshing to know that in
these days where high-tech has
dehumanized the music industry,
the roots of blues and country
have not been forgotten by today’s
performers. On his latest album
Elvis Costello has cast aside the
intricate and stifling production
values that plagued his last two al-
bums in favor of a cleaner, leaner
sound. King of America, his latest
effort, unnerves hardcore Costello

fans, but fills a void left after the
release of Imperial Bedroom and
places Costello back in music’s
center ring. In an effort to cast
aside the pop star image that
didn’t suit him, Costello changed
his name back to Declan
McManus and for the new album
he has all but shed the Attractions.
Instead he has chosen elder
Jazzmen Ray Brown and Earl
Palmer and surviving members of
Elvis Presley's TCB band to sup-
port him. However, he has been
primarily influenced by Texas

movie's problem. Almost all of
the movie is subordinated to let-
ting Murray get all the best lines,
the best skits, and the best girls.
What happens is that Ghostbus-
ters becomes a one man show,
with all the rest of the cast doing
nothing more than playing straight
men and women to Bill the
Clown.

Putting Murray in the center of
the movie wouldn't be such a bad
idea if he were very funny. The
problem is that he isn’t. Murray
always plays one type of character
~— the obnoxious brat who thumbs
his nose at authority. This style
worked very well in Stripes, when
he was ragging the army, and in
Meatballs, when he was twisting
all the boring rules of summer
camps. In Ghostbusters Murray
has got the show completely to
himself. There is no authority to
battle, except for the idiot EPA in-
spector (perhaps that’s why the

to roots on

rocker T-Bone Bumett. Burnett,
who produced the album, collabo-
rated with Costello last year form-
ing the Coward Brothers on the
English single “People’s
Limousine”. Burnett himself dab-
bled in a similar production on a
smaller scale with his EP Behind
the Trap Door (availible only as
an import), but the result was a
fragmented half-baked effort that
was an embarrassment to his tal-
ents.

Fortunately, King of America

Republicans used this movie).
This bastion of authority comes in
about halfway through the picture
and is soon put in its place by Bill
the Magnificent. So what you get
is a movie in which Bill is the life

of the party.
The plot shambles along,
picking up ideas like burrs,

throughout the picture. When
things get dull, the makers of
Ghostbusters throw in something
else and hope. This desperate ef-
fort to find something funny re-
sults in a stew where leftovers get
thrown in. The plot alternates be-
tween Murray chasing the girl, the
Busters going after a ghost, Mur-
ray trapping Weaver into a date,
the Busters getting another ghost,
and then winding up with a gen-
eral apocalypse. This is supposed
to be funny. The result is often this
scene (but be careful not to laugh
too hard):

Ramis: Don’t cross the cur-

rents.

Murray: What happens if we
cross the currents?

Ramis: I’m not sure, but life as
we know it throughout the univer-
se might end.

Murray: O.K. Be careful.

Chen: Yeah, wow, zowie,
yeehaw, yip, yip, yip.

This joke gets repeated a
couple of times, so the audience
can get it.

These comments will proba-
bly not change anybody's mind.
The people who liked Ghostbus-
ters the first time will want to see
it again. The people who have
never seen it can ignore this carp-
ing and go with the majority.
Ghostbusters will be shown on
Friday night in Love Auditorium
at 7:30 and 9:45 P.M. Before the
movie will come a Three Stooges’
short film, Spook Louder. Curley
is in this one, so Spook Louder is a
kind of Stooges classic.

does not follow in the same
groove. There are some real gems
here such as “Lovable”, “Our Lit-
tle Angel”, “I’ll Wear It Proudly” ,
“Suit of Lights” (the only track
with the Attractions), and a won-
derful version of the Animals’
“Don’t Let Me Be Misun-
derstood”. But the hardest part of
listening to King is getting used to
the starkness of the arrangements
coupled with Costello’s

(McManus’) uncharacteristically

slow vocal. Hence, the absence of
the Attractions is painfully obvi-

ous. In addition, while the music

has been stripped down, the lyrics

still remain carefully contrived
constructions which serve to dis-
tance the listener from the musical
warmth which Costello and Bur-
nett work so hard to create. This is
by no means a masterpiece, but it
shows more promise than any-
thing that Costello has put out

since Armed Forces. While Elvis

Costello the Pop Star is dead, De-

clan McManus the writer is alive
and well.
