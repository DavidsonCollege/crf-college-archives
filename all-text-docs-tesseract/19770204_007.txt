The most controversial ex-
penditure is the $30,000 auto-
mation equipment. The equip-
ment could be preprogrammed
to run for at least three days.

Barrett says, ‘I’m worried
that the college will turn the
music over to a professional
programmer. The staff inter-
est is that the students will
have a free hand in the musical
policy and that students will
be on the air.” .

Barrett has two major wor-
ries. First he fears the staff
will be cut from 55 to 5.

The second concern is the
type of music which will be
played. ‘‘Since it’s a money
making venture and their aim-
ing at the alumni in Charlotte
I just can’t see how they'd let
us program for the students.’’

He goes on to say, ‘‘Law-
rimore said we must increase
the quality of the program-

ming which in essence means
training the less professional
DJ’s. This could mean Musac,
Minty Carney, or John Den-
ver, but I strongly doubt that
he’ll want rock. In other words
he wants the station to be for
the people outside of Davidson
instead of inside.”’

Knowing the power and
delicacy of the automation
equipment, Bill Burkholder
fears renovations of the Union
basement will have to be
made. He says the equipment
will be put in the hall blocking
the entrance to the counseling
offices, bookstore, and print
shop. A tunnel would then
have to be built to provide a

separate entrance to WDAV.

~ Burkholder names future
expenses to be the replace-
ment of the old equipment.
“They plan to use the present

equipment for production pur-
poses. This equipment is 16
years old. It’s falling apart
and noisy.”’

Barrett, Sealy and Burkhol-
der all feel the increase would
require the hiring of a full-time
engineer and possible prog-
rammer to oversee the general
function of the station.
Federal regulation the new
transmitter will have to be in
operation all year long which
would require people to oper-
ate the station during the

According to Burkholder if
they decide to invest in auto-
mation equipment to handle
the work ‘‘students would not
‘have time to handle the paper
work involved.”’

raise money for the college or will it be
an enormous waste? Will expensive,
enormous automation equipment be
purchased at the tune of $40,000?
Where will it be fit in an already
crowded Union basement?

No one seems to know the answers
to these basic questions, and FCC
approval of the license application will
occur by February 15th. The college
must begin work on the station within
three months to retain the license.

If they stall and hem and haw
about answering these questions,
they could conceivably wait until May
15th, when everyone is worried about
graduation and exams and not their

ealing. He said the new station is
“opportunity for Davidson stu-
its to do something professional,
ner than having WDAV just a play
ig.’ Others in the administration,
uding Development Vice Presi-
tt, Dwayne Dittman, have referred
‘he station as a toy.

Although the number of
student DJ’s will be reduced
to the highly qualified, Golden
has been promised ‘‘(the cut)
will not be a wholesale slaugh-
ter,’’ by Lawrimore.

The WDAV staff is anxious
about the prospect of an
automation system and the
reduction of students able to
broadcast.

“T am startled by the stu-
dents’ reaction to this,” said
Spencer. “I thought the stu-
dents knew about it and were
excited. I thought it was an
opportunity to do something
professional rather than have

just a play thing. This will
open up all kinds of opportun-
ities for students to do some-
thing really good.”

“Tt has always been the
assumption that this will be
student run,’”’ he continued.
“Students can be involved in
news programming and stu-
dent DJ’s for classical music.’’

“If you want WDAV to bea
student activity it would be
very inexpensive to have a
carrier current,’”’ Spencer said.

Golden blames the students’
anxiety on the fact that the
discussion of the power in-
crease has been kept low key.

“Nobody understands what
is going on is the basic
problem,’’ he said. ‘‘There has
had to be a sort of silence, it’s
not something that should be
flaunted, but should be talked
about openly.”

“But you can’t go around
saying we’re going to have

So you have to keep it low
key.”’

Barrett

grammer, says, ‘‘When we
first heard of the upping of the
wattage everyone was excited.
Then some things we began
hearing were conflicting with
what Lawrimore had said be-
fore.”

“‘Lawrimore said things like
we'd have to trim down the
staff to the competent ones
and we’d have only as much
staff as we could justify. We
heard from another source
that the automation would be
most of the time with pre-pro-
grammed music.”

We found out also,’’ Holli-
day continues, ‘‘that they
would have to hire a full-time
engineer plus I don’t think
they would trust the program-

ming to students, which would
entail a full-time program-
mer.”

“On the advertising pam-
phlet for the automation
equipment one of the biggest
things is that it takes only one

- person to run the equipment, a

receptionist, and someone to
survey up the floor. So you
can see how many students ,
would be needed.’’

Janet Coleman, a WDAV
DJ, expresses the staff’s main
concern. ‘‘We feel that the
money could be spent better
elsewhere. The figures are
close to $100,000 and we feel
that could be better spent than
in a radio station we don’t

Barrett expresses his frus-
tration by saying, ‘‘I’mina
position of responsibility but I
don’t know to whom I am
responsible. I do know I’m
responsible to the student
interest.’”” He went on to say,
“T will suspend any staff
action until the trustees reach
a decision.”

He concludes, ‘It’s real
ambiguous, but everything I
know is ambiguous.”

THE WDAV STAFF is worried that only five of these people will be allowed to work
with the station after the power increase.
