Nationwide Protest Against ROTC Continues

ED. NOTE: The following
article is reprinted from The
Christian Science Monitor.

Protests against college ROTC
(Reserve Officers Training
Corps) are like brush fires:
they're hard to put out.

For the past 10 years they

demic firemen on campuses

Chronicle, Duke University.

Many colleges and universities
throughout the nation have been
influenced by discussions on the
merits of an ‘‘experimental col-
lege.”

Although the term has meant
something a bit different in each
case, most of the institutions
have discussed the advantages
of a freer, more personal frame-
work for the intellectual com-
munity, in order to stimulate
thought and develop more fully
the potential of the students and
faculty.

Two universities having insti-
tuted “experimental colleges”
are the University of California
at Santa Cruz and Princeton
University.

The booklet furtner states that
“seminars will be employed to

to advanced work in the stu-

The college has resident fac-

to the Academie Plan, ‘the prox-

faculty and students within the

colleges should make their at-
mosphere more intellectual and
more adult than that of the
usual residence hall.”

NO GRADES

The emphasis in the experi-
ment is on the independent study
and interdisciplinary courses.
The students only take three
courses per quarter. The grades
used at present are “pass” and
“fail,” but their continued use
is presently being debated by
the college's academic senate.

A faculty member considered
the “first year at Santa Cruz to
have been most promising in
the development of superior
students who worked on their
own for knowledge, not for

by Bradford Cleveland, taken
from The Berkeley Student Re-

Cleveland questions the sys-
tem presently used in mest uni-
versities. According to Cleve-

Altman wrote in the college's

THE FUN BEGINS AT

the encouragement of the Penta-
gon, the university made the
program entirely voluntary.

In Ann Arbor, University of
Michigan antiwar students pro-
test with a sense of humor.
They occasionally schedule a
Peacemakers Ball” to coincide
with the ROTC's annual ‘‘Mili-
tary, Ball.”

Minor eruptions have occurred
this fall at St. Lawrence College.
N. Y.: Marietta College. Ohio:
Ohio Wesleyan University, Del.:
and Middlebury College. Vt. An
official at Duke University says
that although no protests have
yet broken into the open there.
subterranean rumblings are be-
ginning to be heard.

A loud protest has, however,
surfaced at Boston University.
In its first issue of the school
year this fall, the student news-
paper, BU News, featured a
column-length editorial and sev-
eral pages of news stories criti-
cizing ROTC at BU.

ROTC officials reacted swiftly.
defending their position and
charging the newspaper with
slanting its news coverage.

Out of the flurry of charges
and counter-charges may come
faculty action. The university is
currently in a_ self-study pro-
gram. One of the recommenda.
tions of a faculty group is ex-
pected to be that military
science be denied academic
credit. Whether such a sugges-
tion would be accepted is un-
certain.

CRITICS

ROTC critics fall into two
camps: those who want to deny
military science academic credit
and demote it to an extracurri-
cular activity and those who
want the corps off the campus
altogether.

Both camps include students.
professors, and administrators.
Many of them are involved in
other antiwar activities. Some
are new. to the political uproar
on campus.

Both camps agree that:
Some _ military-science
courses aren’t proper meat for
an academic institution. Fre-
quently named are marksman-
ship and ‘‘leadership laboratory”
~—close-order drill.

— Neither ROTC professors
nor military-science courses go
through regular academic chan-
nels before being approved at a
university.

— Because ROTC professors
are paid by the military, and
not by the university, and be-
causé course content is pre-
scribed by the military. the uni-
versity has no control over
ROTC.

Military-science courses
represent a militaristic point of
view. and offer no ‘presentation
of possible alternatives to mili-
tary force.

— Since the university must
be a “universal” institution. in
order to remain academically
free, it should neither support
nor accept support from any
government. This includes, say
the critics, providing free class-
room and office space for ROTC.

— Military-science instructors
frequently do not have the same
academic credentials other fac-
ulty members are required to

have.

— Military-science instructors
too often are transferred away
from ROTC duty before they
have a chance even to become
accustomed to a teaching rou-
tine.

Some opponents of ROTC
charge that when a university
declares ROTC persene non
grata, defense grants tend to
disappear at the same time. Not
all the ROTC critics agree on
this, though, and even the ac-
cusers admit it is hard to prove.

When asked if he had heard
of any such pressure being
brought by the armed forces.
one ROTC spokesman  pooh-
poohed the idea.

The supporters of ROTC are
not restricted to the ranks of
the military. At Boston Univer-
sity one of the corps’s best
friends is Dr. Erazim V. Kohak,
a philosophy professor.

Dr. Kohak charges that un-

derlying all the arguments a-
gainst ROTC ‘‘is the question of
whether we really approve of
armies at all.”
, He contends that in today's
world a military establishment
is necessary to maintain peace
and freedom.

Dr. Kohak defends the prac-
tice of giving academic .credit
for ROTC courses on the same

‘basis that academic credit is

given for any professional course
—broadcasting, education, theo-

‘logy.

“‘We're not out to build a mili-
tary society,”’ he says. ‘But we
do have the problem of training
military officers and at the same
time keeping them with a basi-
cally civilian outlook. ROTC is
ideally suited to this.’

NEW PROPOSAL

Dr. Kohak sees the “universal
institution’ concept of the uni-
versity as impractical idealism.
It would be wonderful, he says.
to have a truly universal -aca-
demic institution. But in many
parts of the world this is im-
possible.

He contends that to maintain
the academic freedom enjoyed
in the United States and the free
world, the political structure
must be supported. And the
political structure, he argues. is
protected by the military.

_Dr. Kohak is not total in his
support. He says the university
should have more academic con-
trol over some military-science
courses. The tools for control are
there, he says, but they have
never been used.

“It would be interesting,” says
Dr. Kohak, “to submit a mili-
tary history course to the his-
tory department for approval. It
would be interesting to see the
reaction of the Army if the

course were rejected.”

Dr. Kohak agrees that the
filitary should retain control
over strictly military course ma-
terial. He admits that in this
area the Army knows better
than the university what an of-
ficer needs.

RIGHT KEPT

Military-science courses are,
in fact, outlined by the armed
services. But Boston University
maintains the right, as do all
schools with ROFC units, to re-
ject any proposed subject ma-
terial.

ROTC instructors, too, are un-
der the nominal control of each
university. They are military of-
ficers, assigned to ROTC for
an average three-year tour of
duty. They are paid by the
armed forces. not by the univer-
sity. The services submit dos-
siers on one or more candidates.
The university can disapprove
all of them if it so chooses.

Col. Mario T. Villanti, who has
charge of the military-science
program at Boston University.
also says ROTC instructors are
as well prepared as their coun-
terparts in other academic
fields. He himself has a law
degree and is a member of the
Massachusetts Bar Association.

ORIGINS

ROTC grew out of the Stu-
dent's Army Training Corps.
which was established shortly
before the end of World War I
to help provide men for that
effort.

Until recently many land-grant
colleges had compulsory four-
year ROTC training for all male
students. Some. however. have
now cut the requirément back to
two years. Many have dropped
the compulsory feature alto-
gether.

All ROTC cadets—those either
under the compulsory or volun-
teer program—are trained in
two-year units of study. Around
half of those who complete the
first two-year unit do not go on
to the second. or advanced.
course.

Most of those who do complete
the four-year course are even-
tually commissioned as officers
in one of the armed forces.

Some semesters cadets spend
as much as half their time each
week in military science. Other
semesters a cadet may be re-
quired to spend very little of
class time in military courses.

Given the student-protest at-
mosphere on most campuses to-
day. anti-ROTC flare-ups can be
expected to continue. But the
ROTC concept appears firmly
entrenched in the nation's edu-
cational scene. As a voluntary
subject it is likely to be around
for some time to come.
