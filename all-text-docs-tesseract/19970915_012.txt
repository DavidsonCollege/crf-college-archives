7 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Richard Prior: the man,
the music, the orchestra

Davidson’s composer-in-residence offered semester residency at Oxford

By ANNE STANCIL

“The Orchestra, like any musi-
cal ensemble, is not a faceless cor-
poreal entity, but a dynamic collec-
tion of individuals giving of their
talents and sensibilities to produce
the whole.” Philosopher of prose,
perhaps, but most cer-
tainly a philosopher of
music, Davidson’s own
Richard Prior epito-
mizes the title Musical
Artist. A delicate com-
bination of command-
ing presence, dry Brit-
ish wit, and graceful
sensitivity, Prior leads
the Davidson College
Symphony Orchestra to

_ greatness season after
season. In his fifth year
at Davidson, Prior re-
flects on the past,
present and future of his
music as well as the or-
chestra.

For the readers
who do not know this
wild and crazy charac-
ter, here is a mini-biog-
raphy of the man known only to
some students as “that funny Brit-
ish guy.” Originally from Royal
Tonbridge Wells, England (which *
is in East England in Kent about
thirty-five miles south of London),
Prior obtained a rich musical edu-
cation in the

‘high Angli-
can Cathe-
drals. This
background
prepared him
for his under-
graduate stud-
ies at the Uni-
versity of
Leeds, where

with American students. Immedi-
ately immersed in American
academia, Prior spent two years at
Franklin and Marshall University
(Penn.). There he served as two
sabbatical replacements, the first of
which earned him the title Artist in
Residence. At F&M, Prior taught
composition and theory, as well as

guest conducted the college orches-
tra and choir.

Finally, Prior arrived to the
Southern hospitality of Davidson

College. In his second year, Prior .

added another jewel to his already
decorated crown with the reestab-
lishment of the
Symphony Or-
chestra. After
a forty-year
hiatus, the or-
chestra was
brought back

a degree in music, majoring in per-
formance and the noble art of com-
position. After having conquered
the vast undergraduate realms of
musical studies, it was off to
Nottingham (the famed home of
Robin Hood and his merry men) for
further study of composition at the
University of Nottingha, where he
also conducted the University Or-
chestra. In his three years in
Nottingham (when he was not rob-
bing the rich to save the poor), Prior
perfected his art of composition with
American composer James
Fulkerson. Two of his symphonies
and numerous choral pieces were
performed while studying in
Nottingham. Having triumphed in
England, Prior came to the United
States to share his rich traditions —

Residence at Davidson. His com-
positions have been heard and per-
formed around the world. The last
major work was premiered in the
spring of 1996 right here in
Davidson. “Phoenix Rising,” aCon-
certo for Piano and Orchestra was
presented by the Davidson College
Symphony Orchestra and the be-
loved Jim Swisher, Pianist in Resi-
dence.

This semester Prior leaves the
orchestra and returns to his native
England to pursue his compositions.
Having been granted a junior leave
of absence by the Dean of Faculty
and the Music Department, Prior
has accepted a prestigious Visiting
Fellowship in Music at Oxford
University. Perhaps one of the
youngest individuals to receive this

great honor, Prior will work on a
chamber opera, which is in collabo-
ration with Rupert Barber of
Davidson’s Theater Department,
and a commissioned piece for the
Charlotte Symphony to be pre-
miered in the fall of 1998.. He will
also be working with the Oxford
University orchestra and lecturing

fellowship is not enough for the’

English music gurus: Prior has been

invited by the Royal Academy of .

Music and Trinity College in Lon-
don to lecture about his contempo-
rary music.

Leaving the orchestra tempo-
rarily for one semester will be hard
for Prior, but, in his own words,
“We are very privileged to be able
to draw upon the services of David
Tang, conducting assistant of the
Charlotte Symphony, and our own
Aaron Lesher, assistant conductor
of the Davidson Orchestra.” Each
year has been special for the orches-
tra. Whether featuring Davidson
students, faculty, or professional
musicians, the orchestracommands
an audience of over 1,000 and has
been featured on WDAV. Still
riding high from the momentous
performance of Mozart’s ‘“Re-

quiem” last spring, the Orchestra ©

gallops into another exciting sea-
son. On the program this year will
be two pieces by Mozart, Berlioz’s
“Summer Nights”, Vivaldi’s Four
Seasons, Beethoven’s Fifth Sym-
phony, Mahler, and a concerto fea-
turing the winner of Davidson’s first
concerto competition. This season
features many of Davidson’s won-
derful student musicians. Prior is
very proud of the progress the or-
chestra has made thus far: “The
orchestra is unique because it em-
braces people of all levels of ability
and background. A vast majority of
the members are not music majors;
they just have a love for music.”
Reflecting on the orchestra and
music in general, Prior may wax
philosophic; however, he has great
passion for the art he has perfected
through his compositions and con-
ducting. The orchestra will miss

him, but sends him off to commit

great acts of music.
