Reactions to us have been
interesting. I mentioned
some of them last time (Don’t
you feel strange’ here?’’).
What I'd really like to know
are the  uncommunicated
méntal reactions behind some
of the verbal responses.

What do they think, those
who now know we're here
for the duration but who
wonder. I have my guesses.

Mental reaction: ‘There
go those exchange students.
Why in the world would any-
one want to leave their own
school to be one of niné boys
et an all girls school?

They must. be veal. losers.
I guess they figure out of
1,000 girls there's bound to
be some, . .”

Verbal
“Hello”.

reaction: (coldly)

Mental reaction: What
are those guys trying to
prove? They think — they’re
cashing in on a good thing.

They know that girls start
climbing the walls on ‘Thurs-
day nights too.”

Verbal reaction: none.

.The friendly smiles and
greetings I frankly don't
try to analyze, It's enough
for me to accept them at
face .value.

The administration's reac-
ion to us officially has been,
“The president and Mie oth
er members of the adminis-
tration join me in express--
ing the hope that this will
be a personally — satisfying
and educationally rewarding
experience.’ (In a_ letter
from John P. Wheeler. Jr.,
Dean of the College.)

Unofficially, but quite
clearly, the reaction has
been, ‘‘What the -hell do we
do with these guys?"

* Our real rub with the ad
ministration has been over
social regula‘ions. Prelimin-

‘ary information about restric-

tions on us Was. nebulous,

To the Editor:

In this rather. brief com.
ment, we wish to aiscuss the
recent attacks on THE DAV-
IDSONIAN, specifically those
launched by Richard C.
Burts Jr., Dean of Students
It is our contention that his
objections to ‘unethical jour-
nalism .are unfounded and,
therefore, irresponsible. _

Just a month ago, we at-
tended a conference in Char-
lotte organized’ by President

Spencer. Also there were
several trustees, student
leaders (including the edi-

tor of THE DAVIDSONIAN
and an associate’ editor).
college ‘administrators, a few
of the faculty, and Burts.

One’ of the topics of dis
cussion was the present art-
icle in the “Code of Respon
sibility dealing with drugs.

Dr. John. Kelton was the
first to mention.the propos-
ed change of ithe Code. At
that time, Burts made no
attempt to suppress the Stu-
dent Life Committee recom-
mendation.

It is also. important to
note that Kelton is not a

To the Editor:

For thexpast year the re-
putation of THE DAVID-
SONIAN has undergone ser-
ious, if not irreparable dam-
age, due to the unscrupu-
lous mechanisms of one of
its staff. members, John
McLean.

Last week “An article Tun
on the‘front page of the pa-
per dic its (yellow) jour-
nalistic best to create a mar
tyr out of Mr. McLean. In
the article, Dean Burts was
quoted denouncing the “un-
ethical tactics’’ McLean in-
corporated by leaking un-
disclosed information from a
Student Life Committee re-
port concerning drugs.

To read the article, one
naturally. empathizes with
the plight of the beleaguered
Mr. McLean.«The-boy versus
the ogre. David against Go-*
liath.

’Well, this was obviously
the effect desired. . . By
Mr. McLean. Although the

byline reported Steve Cross
as author, the information
flowed from the pen of Mc-
Lean - himself. What © was
most startling of all is: that,
evidently, the entire DAVID-
SONIAN staff was aware of

this: maneuver.

That THE DAVIDSONIAN
would color an article on an
issue is a_ situation with
which we have learned to
live. But that it ‘would con-
done McLean's action in
creating a martyr of him-
self in the eyes of the col-
lege community on a matter
of highly questionable taste,
is intolerable.

To coin one of Mr. Mc
Lean's clever colloquialisms,
my information comes from
a very reliable ‘‘undisclosed
source’’-whose- name, I, too,
would refuse to reveal to a
twelve-man jury.

This example seems to be
typical. What also is, ap-
parently condoned among
the staff members is he
manner in which McLean

has corftinuously usurped
authority from those in
whom this jurisdiction is

vested, by title or talents.

I really don't know if Mr.
McLean is running for edi-
tor, president, or king, but
when power is held by one
of such unscrupulous meth-
ods, the entire college com-
munity is apt to suffer.

member of, the said com-
mittee, and _one wonders
where he obtained a copy of
a’ report meant only for the
eyes of President Spencer,

In effect, the possibility of
discontinuing the enforce
ment of drug laws entered
the public domain, for clear-
ly the meeting of some for-
ty members of the David
son College community was
considered, an open forum.

Based on these observa
tions, we believe that THE
DAVIDSONIAN’” was well
within its rights as an_in-
formation medium. when? it
reported the decision of the
Student Life Committee.

One final point. For a ma
jority of Davidson students.
the undisputed article ‘not
only reported the issyg, but
also announced it.

Until that moment, secre
cy had been the watch word,
so to speak, of the SLC, in
that regrettably few were

aware of tthe committee's
actions.
This. .is unjustifiable in

view of the fact that the SLC
is a joint student-faculty
committee, not to mention
the significance of such an
amendment of the Code.

We find it strange, indeed,
that Dean Burts would not
consider student. enlighten-
ment concerning a major ad-
justment in Davidson policy
important.

In light of the imminent
gathering of trustees here
at Davidson, one wishes to
believe that this is not the
attitude of the Dean. Unfor-
tunately, little room remains
for-such- opinion.

It is the lack of pubhic dis-

‘ cussion which Dean Burts

seems to condone that was
responsible for much of the
confusion and mistakes sur-
rounding last year’s drug

‘fiasco, THE DAVIDSONIAN

was only performing a func-
tion which long ago should
have been attended to by

Dean Burts and the com-
mititee,

In truth, had not
DAVIDSONIAN printed the
story, it would have been
derelict in its responsibility
to the entire college com
munity to keep it informed
in this major decision.

Which to us meant there
weren't to be any rules. . —

After we had been oper-
ating under this premise for
wbout a week, some Hollins
girl noticed the discrepancy
between our rather autono-
mous existence and the re-
latively regulated’ situation
on campus -.- specifically no
alcohol or men in the rooms.

We were shortly invited
to-a Tittle get-together at
the Dean's house, complete
with beer and pretzels, to
“jointly work out any points
of misunderstanding about
our status."

Three days later two stone
tablets were delivered to
our house: upon -which was
written, ‘Thou shalt not
drink,"’and “Thou shalt not
have .girls in thy rooms."
Thus spake the administra-
tion, i

Even more in a quandary
about what to do about us
is/the security force. In ad-
dition to Cop Linker’s du-
ties (locking doors, dispens-
ing tickets, and generally
being around) ‘the Rent-A-
Cops here have taken it upon
themselves to protect and de-
fend the honor and chastity
of 1,000 girls.

Not covered by the regu-
lations book, we have been
regarded as some _ hostile,
alien element which, despite
efforts to the contrary, re
fuses to go away.

I don't really blame the ©
cops for hassling us or pro-
bably suspecting us of being
drug addicts they (or any-
one else here for that mat-
ter) have never dealt with
our “‘situation"”’ before.

Housing Crisis Attacked;
Mess Blamed On Burney

To the Editor:

Last week the Residence
Hall Association decided to
ask Mrs. Nicholls to end the
iradition of Belk and Rich-
ardson Hall studenis leaving

their rooms for a _ major
weekend.
This weekend Davidson

students will reap the ‘‘bene-
fits’: the ineonvenience of
‘raveling some distance in
town to get the girl to her
temporary home, if she is
lucky enough to have a
place to stay at all!

A quick glance ai the sit-

uation will show how ridi-
culous this move was. With-
out doubt, most students in
the affected dorms, includ-
ing myself, see the policy of
having to move om for two
days bothersome.
* Yet this is a small incon-
venience for the pains many
students: have gone through
this week to find housing for
their dates.

The lis: of _ townspeople

“who keep girls was exhaust-

ed last’ Monday. I dare say
many students will still have
no place for their dates as of
Friday.

The town of Davidson is
just not that. big. Many
townspeople that really’ have
no desire will be pressured
into keeping girls. They will

do it only for the sake of the
college.

Those students lucky
enough to get a place for
their. dates, but who don’t
have cars, will have added
problems: the possibility of
having ‘to walk a mile or
more to “pick up’ their
dates. God help them if it
rains!

The RHA took its action
upon receiving a pétition’ of
250 names, some of whom
didn't realize the impact of
their signatures,

This number is less than
half the number of students
rooming—in~Belk~and™ Rich:
ardson.

Furthermore, no student
referendum was’ called for.
Mrs. Nicholls can't be blam-
ed. It falls directly on Cecil
Burney and Co. I suggest
they wake up and get with
it!

An immediate reterendum
is in order with only Belk
and Richardson voting. The
RHA would abide by the out-
come. -

I am confident tha: this
will be the last weekend with
serious housing problems.
Many students are going to
ind out how small the incon-
venience of moving out real-
ly is. a
