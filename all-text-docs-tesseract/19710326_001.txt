The Executive Committee
af the Board of Trustees in
joint session with the Trus-
tee. Building and Grounds
Committee voted yesterday
to recommend to the Board
of Trustees that the new li-
brary be built directly be-
hind Chambers at the site
presently occupied by the
College Union.

The library will be a three-
story structure with 100,000
square feet of floor space
(approximately the size of
Chambers): The total esti-
mated cost, according to the
architect, . will be $3.8 mil-
lion.

If the trustees approve this
site at their meeting May
13-14, the architects will pro-
ceed to draw up plans for
the building, and the admin-
istration will proceed with
plans for fund-raising and
financing.

The College Union will be
torn down and replaced with
the new library; however,
no definite plans. were made
by these committees for re-
location of union facilities.

Director ofthe College Un-
ion C. Shaw Smith submitted
to the trustee committees a
report’ of alternative sugges-
tions for union space and
Programs.

The report suggested that
the General Feeding Food
Service could be relocated in

Chambers Banquet Hall. or

possibly distributed’ around
the fraternity houses.
The book store, according
to the report, might be mov-
- ed to a building in the town,
and the Game room would be
located either in Chambers
‘Banquet Hall or in any emp-
ty fraternity houses.

Morrison Room could be re-

The trustee committees did

that ‘‘in some way student
activities will be » brought
together.”’

Concerning the financing of
the new library, C. David
Cornell, vice president of fi-
nance and development, told
the trustees that the college
presently has $2 million in
cash, and that another $1.8
million would | have to be
raised.

Some trustees questioned
whether the college could
raise this amount of money;
however, Cornell suggested
possible plans by which the
college could raise these
funds.

“‘We can mount a capital
campaign this fall,’ he said

- “There is an outside possi-

bility there may. be funds
available from the federal
government earmarked for

library construction. Or we

may be able to get general
federal funds.”’

Early Self Selection

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

Dean of Students Will Ter-
ry hinted to the student Sen-
ate Wednesday that the ad-
ministration may allow fresh-
men to self-select into an eat-
ing club sometime:in May.

Invited to the: Senate to.
answer questions on the
Status of ramdom _§assign-
ment, Terry said he may dis-

cuss the: self-selection alter-

native with the Student Life
Committee in the near fu-
ture,

“This alternative may re-
lieve the tension and anxiety
among the freshmen and re-
lieve the financial burden as
well,” said Terry. e

Another reason for this di-
version from the Committee

ernment funds.

The architects told the trus-
tees that this particular site
was selected because it is
centrally located as an aca-
demic center and is the best
alternative “tas far as con-
venience, accessibility, and
appearance is concerned."’

The library will be able to
accommodate more than
500,000 volumes, and it will
provide reader space for at
least 600-700 students.

of Eighteen Report, accord-
ing to Terry, was that dur-
ing the winter term fresh-
men were allowed to. eat
at the union if they prefer-
ed not to eat at their assign-
ed house.

However, the business of-
fice received a bill for the
winter term of $5000 for
meals which students ate at
the Union instead of at their
assigned house.

Terry’ -also.-hinted that
another provision might be
made for those freshmen
who are not. interested in
participating in the social
system.

A motion was then defeat-
ed that would have ‘allowed
freghmen .to choose whether
they want to eat solely at

the union, solely at’ the
assigned house or at both
places,

Vice President of Aca-

demic Affairs John M. Bev-
an, also invited to the meet-
ing, notified the Senate that
the Physical Education De-
partment has been givén un-
til May 24 by the Eduéation-
al Policy Committee to form-
ulate a proposal of reform in
the physical education pro-
gram.

Bevan assured the Senate
that different options are
presently being considered;

Peace Coalition

By GRAY , WILSON
Managing Editor

The Davidson Peace Coali-
tion kicked off operations
this week with several or-
ganizational meetings to plan
campus involvement in the
May Day spring offensive
against the Vietnam War.

Spearheaded by junior
Mark (Meza, the group offi-
cially adopted a charter
Thursday night. Plans in-
clude correlated spring ac-
tivities: at Davidson and a
trip to Washington, D. C. for
the first weekend in May.

“We've got a lot of things
in the fire right now,’’ Meza
said. ‘‘We want the work
we're doing to be broader
than just one week in May,
namely’ a legitimate organi-
zation recognized on campus
and open to the (Mavidson
community.”’

The coalition is tentatively
planning activities such as a
film on ‘Laos, posters, hand-
outs, the sale of buttons, a
phone service, and a speaker
program for assemblies at
local high schools.

Meza’ said that the group
will work in conjunction wjth
the National Peace ‘Action

Coalition, Quaker groups, Vi-
etnam veteran groups against
the war, and other local city,
college, and high school
groups.

Immediate plans include a
commemorative community
activity in honor of Martin
Luther King Jr. during. the
first week in: April. Meza
said he has talked with Da-
vidson (Mayor Tom Sadler
about such an event.

According to Meza, ‘‘The
group is interested in corre
lating some kind of activity
on the race issue here at Da-
vidson,”’

Meza added that he hoped
some academic _ arrange-
ments could be made to per-
mit students to take time off
from the regular work load
(May 1-5.

“We're going to request
that the faculty release stu-

’ dents from all academic re-

quirements, and if this is
impossible then we are go-
ing to ask to be allowed to
postpone the work, to he
made up before or after the
activities,"’

Sophomore (Ralph Peeples
predicted that forty or fifty
Davidson students will be in

, thing,” he .

however, he wanted to wait

for Director of Athletics and
Physical » Education Tom
Scott to return from . the
NCAA Basketball Tourna-

ment before a decision is
made.

When asked what effect a
io of physica] educa-
tion Would have, Bevan said,
“I don’t think a boycott is
too meaningful. In fact I
think it would hurt you more
than it would help you. vi

Many senators expressed
fear that the faculty would
be slow to react on the phys-
ical education issue. *How-
ever, Bevan assured: the 'Sen-

_ ate that “there is no inten-

tion of dragging feet.

“Iwill do everything I can
to get the materials and pre-
sent them to the EPC as
soon as I can, ‘But I cannot
predict what action they will
take,”’ he said.

The Senate then passed a
resolution to defer a dedision
on the  physieal education
boycott until the faculty has
made a decision on the ‘issue.

In other Senate action a
resolution was passed unani-
mously that the continental
breakfast be extended to
10:20 a.m. five days a week.
Doug Haynes plans to- pre-
sent’ this resolution to» the
cafeteria service.

Formed

Washington for May Day but
that no collective action is
planned among ‘them. ‘‘This
is going to be an individual
said. ‘Nobody
from here is pushing any-
thing but nonviolence, and
everybody can choose how
he wants to express himself
in his own way.”

Approximately 450,000 stu-
dents are expected to be in
Washington this year for -he
anti-war activities, which in-
clude a march on the Capitol
(May 5), the presentation of
the People’s Peace Treaty,
and continuous: sit-ins during
the first week in May.
