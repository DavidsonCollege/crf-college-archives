On Ludvingson: poet and imaginaire

By Shayna Chazin

She seemed to be the quietly
imaginative type. The kind whose
words have a sharp meaning all
their own, never quite revealing
their intellectual punch until just
the right time. Her reading on
Thursday night proved her to be a
woman with an amazing ability to
take odd events or historical fig-
ures, and from these two-dimen-
sional forms create pictures of un-
paralleled brilliance in imagery,
character development, and under-

Survey says

tected sex a dangerous ocean in
which to swim. However, 31% of
male seniors and 5% of female
seniors use protection sometimes
or never. 19% of women and an-
other 31% of men protect them-
selves most of the time, and a smart
71% of women and the other 31%
of men play only when they have
the right gear.

Considering the prevalent lack
of protection, it is odd that a slight
21% of women and 25% of men
have had STD tests.

Morality

Chicago reports that “adultery
is the exception in America, not
the rule. Nearly 75% of married
men and 85% of married women

Stated beauty.

Okay, fine. This may sound
too good to be true—and yes, I was
never a harsh critic of anything
invented with care, but, when Mrs.
Ludvingson read her 20-minute
masterpiece called “The Gospel
According to Mary Magdalene”,
even someone with predominantly
Jewish background had to perk
their ears and lean forward. This
was a poem to be reckoned with. It
stemmed from a recent theory de-

veloped by three English histori-
ans that Jesus actually was married
to Mary Magdalene, and after his
crucifixion, travelled across the
Mediterranean to escape persecu-
tion. Be it true or not, heathen-talk
or just a twist of history, the poet-
ics which grew from this story
were marked with sensual lan-
guage, remarkable depth in the god-
servantrelationship between Jesus
and Mary, anda fluid storyline that
created vivid concrete images in
your head as she read her poem.

STD tests not prevalent

say they have never been unfaith-
ful” (Time Magazine). One of the
most major findings of the study
was the trend toward sexual re-
straint—a outlook so different from
that which the media uses to arouse
us. But this constant barrage of
sex—in arandom 3 hour period on
television, viewers are prompted
to think about sex 28 times (Enter-
tainment Weekly )—may be stifling
the fire that advertisers and pro-
grammers wish to kindle.

78% of senior women love
monogamy, as well as 50% of men.
10% of women and 27% of men
think monogamy is just okay. 8%
of women and 27% of men believe
they are too young tocommit. But
notice—77% of men and 78% of
women would consider living with
a sexual partner. before marriage.

Discrepancy

The most notable difference
between our survey and the Uni-
versity of Chicago study is this:
Chicago’s report says that 54% of
men think about:sex daily, as do
19% of women.

When you walk down the halls
of Chambers tomorrow, look
around you. There is a very good
chance that 78% of women and
100% of men are thinking about

’ sex at that very moment.

72 of approximately 380 se-
niors completed and returned the
surveys, representing 19% of the
senior class. There is a significant
margin of error and a degree of
self-selection bias involved. Inno
way should this report be inter-
preted as aperfectly accurate sam-

_ pling of the aforementioned group.

Hight © Ball

By Jon Hoveland

As he sank his last stripes: the ten and the nine,
only the Eight Ball remained, with his life on the line.
The bar room grew quiet, the people drew near,
they plowed through the smoke, and put down their beer.
The jukebox stopped playing its songs about drinking,
and those close enough, could hear the man thinking.

With a twist of his wrist, he chalked his tip,
and he lit the cigarette that hung from his lip.
He circled the table and got the angles straight
for his final bank shot that decided his fate.
His concentration: as intense as the pressure,
he took one last look and one last measure,
and with one last drag from his cigarette

his face went blank as his stance was set. '
He leaned over the table and turned his head
“Eight Bail in the side,” he said.

No one replied or said anything at all,
as he brought back his stick and struck the cue ball.
The two balls collided like a hammer and nail,
the Eight Ball, in motion, careened off the rail.

It crossed the table heading straight for the pocket,
there was nothing in its way, nothing to block it.
But the Eight Ball moved dreadfully slow,
and everyone wohdered if it would go.
When it came to the edge, time stood still.

It hasn’t fallen yet, but I’m hoping it will.
