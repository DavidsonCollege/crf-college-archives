Still other critics contend that

tenure does not really do the job of
protecting academic freedom for
institutions can actually apply pres-
sure to those with tenure through
clandestine and subtle means. An
outspoken associate professor can be
blocked in promotion to full professor,
or any faculty member speaking or
writing unpopular views can have his
normal salary increase cut or elimi-
nated altogether. The Machiavellian
administrator can employ these wea- .
pons almost with impunity, masking
his intentions behind various bureau-
cratic facades.

The tenured professor who believes

that the expression of his scholarly
beliefs led to his termination can sue
his university for violation of his
academic freedom and breach of
contract. Insulted, demeaned, ridi-
culed and threatened, the courageous
and sincere tenured professor who
continues to proclaim what he be-
lieves to bé the truth at least

sensitive than most people it is not
because their feelings are somehow
more highly activated; it is because
they see more. If we see nothing, we
have nothing to write about. Some-
how writing becomes its own reward.
As we write more, we learn to see
better; as we learn to see better, we
write more.

None of this can really be taught,
but it can be encouraged, and there is
no doubt in my mind that a first step
to. encouraging more and better
student writing is to have a full time
member of the English department
whose specialty is writing. Such a
person could devote a substantial
portion of his time to teaching crea-
tive writing both on the elementary
and on advanced levels, and to help-
ing students with expository and ar-
gumentative writing as well.

Imagine a department of art which
taught courses in art history only;
taught courses in the history of music
only. That is almost the position in
which we find ourselves in regard to
the teaching of writing. There is no
teaching of writing. There is no
member of the current department of
English whose training has been in
the practice and teaching of writing,
and one cannot expect any member of
such a department to give the
majority of his time and energy to
something he is not professionally
trained to do.

But the encouragement to write
must come from students as well as
faculty. If writers often work in

To deal with the abuse of tenure by
those who hide behind it as a form of
job security and who have little
reason to employ it as a protection for
their academic freedom, a few educa-
tors have suggested a dual system of
tenure and nontenure within univer-
sities. They propose that most faculty
members teach on a contractual basis
with renewal dependent upon satis-
factory performance. These faculty
members would be employed for a
fixed period of three to five years
before the end of which they would be
evaluated according to stated criteria.
At that point they would either be
given a renewal for another fixed
period or terminated.

Intriguing as such a possibility
may appear, it seems unlikely at
present since de facto tenure was re-
cognized by the Supreme Court.

The only alternative seems to be to
improve the tenure system through
effective faculty evaluation, the sub-
ject of our next article.

groups, it is because they may give
one another mutual support and
constructive criticism. If there is to be
more and better writing at Davidson,
students will have to be willing to
spend time with one another, sharing
their writing, taking the time both to
write more and to listen to others who
write. They will have to develop
different attitudes toward what writ-
ing is and what kinds of people do it.

I began this article by saying that
when I was in college I did not write. I
wish I had. Most of the experiences of
those years are closed to me now, and
I will never have a record of my
thoughts and feelings then. It was not
until about 1972 that I began to write
with any regularity, and I believe that
the writing I have done has contri-
buted both to my personal and to my
professional life.

Writing was one of those things
that for fifteen years I had no time
for. Now I make time for it, and I do
not think I will ever regret that
decisior.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Student apathy:
| is it too late?

fe

To the Editor: ‘

I am deeply disturbed. It is not a
fleeting depression that one routinely
suffers within these hallowed halls,
but is a feeling almost of despair.

I fear this letter will be to no avail
as letters to the Editor tend to be
overlooked on the editorial page of
this newspaper (and I use that term
rather loosely). The problem is a
widespread one and is of monumental
importance. It affects not only life
here at Davidson, but more generally
it is severely damaging the fabric
which makes up that hard-to-describe
entity that is labeled Davidson Col-
lege.

I am speaking of a lack of feeling, a
lack of caring that seems to pervade
existence here. Time was when one
could walk across campus and not be
able to pass a fellow student without
being greeted with a friendly ‘‘Hello.”’
What happened?

There was once a time at Davidson
where knowledge and its pursuit were
important. for the sake of the mere
achievement of knowledge. Now it
seems as if knowledge is merely a
means to the end of the almighty
grade. But even this is not the whole
point. Students don’t seem to care
much about anything anymore. Gran-
ted, a few people get involved, but for
the most part nothing is important to

IMAC news: a

To the Editor:

Last week while reading my David-
sonian, I came across the spot usually
reserved for IMAC news. In its. place
I found a worthless piece of trash.

Not only did the columnists, Mr.
Combe and Mr. Blackwood, fail to

report any substantial IMAC news:

but they engaged in some petty and
worthless criticisms of the varsity
basketball staff. The IMAC column is
not the place to express these views

the vast majority of Davidson stu-
dents except a grade.
This deficiency has manifest itself {

thinking, is dying, if, in fact, it has
not already died.

Am I overreacting? I think not, for
if I am even partially correct in my
perception, Davidson as a concept in
community and as a fact in aca-
demics, is in serious jeopardy.

Examples of this impending dis-

aster abound. Apathy concerning {

SGA elections, the decline of such {
“thought-oriented”’ organizations as ‘
the Philanthropic Society, the general ¢
lack of fraternal spirit among stu- }
dents as well as the even more ¢
disturbing decline of the spirit of
academic curiosity outside of the §
classroom are but a few of
examples.

(
What can be done? A good question

in need of a definitive and quick
answer. All of us feel the need to turn
within ourselves at some point in our
lives. Many have and are making this
self-analysis at college. But when one
achieves this understanding, when
one (pardon the cliche) “finds him-
self,”” he owes it to his fellow man to
turn outward again to share his
understanding of himself with others,
to make a concerted effort to contri-
bute, to become involved in the

ledge that should be the college.

I hope it is not too late for
Davidson.

piece of trash?

even in such a “humorous” form.

If Mr. Combe and Mr. Blackwood ‘

do not feel that IMAC news is worth |
reporting, I suggest they hand over §
their article to more competent wri-
ters. And the next time such an un-
professional column is submitted with ¢
the message “‘print this article as it is |
or we quit’’ I suggest the editor §
accept the columnists’ resignations.

Baskin picks up redhead

To the Editor:
' I was very disappointed at the
editorial last issue criticizing Bo
Baskin’s handling of the election
results.

As president-elect, he was placed in
a situation with no solution through
the sloppiness of other people, and did
what was probably the fairest thing
possible. Anyone in his position
deserves a lot of credit for accepting

. the job in the first place, not only

because of the time involved but
because it involves dealing with an
administration which constantly
‘works against the students and offers
only runarounds when problems or
suggestions are brought up.

Since Baskin is human there will be
severe limits to what he can do for the

students against such doubletalk, but
he deserves credit for being concerned
enough to try. In the election situa-
tion he considered all alternatives,
was conciliating to all, and did his

opposite of the way the Davidson
administration does things.

If the editor needs something to
worry about, he can look at the front
page again and find out why the
college president cannot even keep a
promise to appoint assistants to
compile a handbook,

The student body has elected a
good leader, so let’s give him a little
more support. He’ll need all he can
get in his position.
