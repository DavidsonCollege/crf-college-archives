By ANDREW COLE
Sports writer

Over the last three weekends,
Davidson sailing competed once
at home and twice at Clemson.
After a second place at Charleston
before spring break, Davidson fol-
lowed up with another second at
Clemson and a third at home to
qualify second behind College of
Charleston for the SAISA Spring
Dinghy Championships.

SAILING

This past weekend, the: team
competed in the second Intersec-
tional regatta of the season. Inter-
sectional regattas are used for na-
tional rankings throughout the sea-
son. Davidson placed aclose third,
merely two points behind The Cita-

del. College of Charleston won
both divisions to take the overall
win.

Sailing for Davidson were se-
niors Lara Onkey and Dave Saudek
in their final regular season re-
gatta. Joining them were sopho-
more Graham Ernst and freshman
Steinen Gerla.

Both divisions started well and
were second for most of the re-
gatta, but in the final races, strong
finishes by The Citadel dropped

»Davidson into third.

Fourth through sixth were
Ohio Wesleyan, Clemson and
Georgia Tech.

Davidson will face The Cita-
del, Clemson, College of Charles-
ton, Eckerd, Rollins, South Florida
and Florida this weekend.

The top two teams qualify for
the National Championships in
Alametos Bay, Calif., where the
top 16 teams in the nation will
come together in late May.

more

The women’s lacrosse team
had yet another disappointing
weekend when it lost 16-4 at Rich-
mond on Saturday.

LACROSSE

The road: game dropped
Davidson’s overall record to 1-7.
It was not, however, a total disap-
pointment as head coach Nancy
Biilger said that the team played
extremely well.

With halftime score of 10-1,
the Wildcats managed to scored
three times in the first 20 minutes
of the second half without letting
the Spiders score once.

Sarah Hogan and Megan
Synder each scored one goal and
senior co-captain Nancy Hilles
nailed the other two.

The Wildcats hit the road twice
this week, Thursday at 3:30 p.m.
against Guilford and Sunday at |
p.m. at Virginia Tech.

Billger said that she is hopeful
about these two upcoming games
and is positive that the whole game
against Guilford can be like the
second half of the game against
Richmond.

“Outdoors Columnist

One day last fall, as I walked
along the bank of Lake Norman, I
noticed an old man standing under
a tree behind me.

THE GREAT

OUTDOORS

“Have ya been fishin’?” he
hollered.

I looked down at my fishing
rod and tackle box, then looked
back at the old man and answered,
“Yeah, but they weren’t biting.”

“Well, if you knew any better,
you'd take yourself to another
fishin’ hole, That Lake Norman —
it’s known as the Dead Sea around
here. There ain’t no fish overa foot
long in there,” the local informed
me.
“Why’s that?” I asked.
“Don’t know myself, but the
fish, they just don’t bite.”

I thanked the man for his ad-
vice and began to walk back to my
truck. As I looked out at the lake, I

_noticed all of the houses, boat docks

and cleared shoreline. At that mo-
ment, I realized how residential
the lake actually was.

It is not remote, such as some
of the lakes in CanadaI have fished.
With its red clay banks and ugly
apartments, it does not even com-
pare to the secluded mountain lakes
of Wyoming.

But one thing I have noticed is
— there are fish in there!

Just the other day after class, I
was inspired by the warm weather
to wet a line, so I took a couple of
friends with me to a cove on the
lake. When we arrived, I noticed
that, although there are houses and
boat docks, there is still some very
good fishing structure.

I noticed many sand and rock
points along with submerged
stumps and fallen trees. While the
sand points are ideal for spawning
sites, the rock points attract bait

fish and crayfish. If these two points

exist near one another, or are com- :

bined on the same point, there ex-
ists an excellent fishing situation.

The addition of stumps and fallen

trees only adds to the point’s pro-
ductivity by giving game fish
places to ambush their prey.

After studying the shoreline
structure, I spotted a fallen tree in
the water lying across a sand and
rock point. I cast to the other tree,
began my retrieve and immedi-
ately felt a thump on the other end.

I reared back to set the hook,
kept steady pressure on the line
and finally lifted the largemouth
bass out of the water. Just after I
released my fish, my buddy pulled
a very large black crappie from a
submerged stump.

In just two minutes of fishing,

we had already proven that old’

man wrong. There are fish in Lake
Norman, and all it takes to catch
them is some effort and careful
observation. Try to study the shore-
line structure and concentrate your
efforts in the “fishy” looking ar-
eas.

Use lures that imitate a bait
fish, such as Rapala and Tiny Trap,
or lures that look like crayfish,
such as Rebel Crawdad.

The main game fish in the lake
are bass and crappie, but there are
numerous blue gill, catfish and
carp, as well.

Upon first sight, Lake Nor-

Is Lake Norman worth fishing?

man might look like the Dead Sea.
But if you analyze the lake closely,
you can catch fish there consis-
tently. Finding new areas to fish is
as much of a sport as pulling in a

fish. Finding these areas, however,
is the first step to a successful
fishing trip.

Catching the fish is merely
icing on the cake.
