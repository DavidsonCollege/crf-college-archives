Last week, forty-one Davidson
professors took out an advertisement
in The Charlotte Observer denouncing
Congressman Jim Martin. This was
one of the most disappointing and
lamentable actions I have ever wit-
nessed at Davidson College. It was at
best done in poor taste, and at worst,
a terrible embarrassment to students
and teachers at the college who did
not take part in the action.

In the first place, the ad did not
mention any dissenting opinion on
campus. Instead, it used Davidson’s
name to further the political ideas of a
minority of its professors. This is a
gross injustice to the students and
teachers at Davidson who do not
share these opinions, yet who are now
inextricably linked to them because of
the ad. Readers throughout the area
have been given the impression that
Davidson is ‘‘anti-Martin’”’.

Secondly, the ad speaks poorly of
the ties that bind Davidson faculty,
students and alumni together. Con-
gressman Martin was once a Chemis-
try professor here.

One of Davidson’s main selling
points is its community and the
togetherness of its students and
teachers. Lasting ties are supposed to
be developed here. The advertisement
thoroughly shattered this illusion.
Admittedly, political ideals are

thought by some to transcend friend-

ship and communal ties; however, one

can hold to his political ideals without

trampling the bonds of friendship into —

total submission. One could vote for
Goodman without publicly belittling
Martin. r

Some of the comments ade by
Professor McKelway in last week's
Davidsonian defending the ad bor-
dered on the absurd. “The Charlotte
Observer is generally a rather

- thoughtful and liberal-minded news-

paper. It’s incredible that it can
endorse a Congressman with one of
the worst voting records in Washing-
ton,”’ he said.

Martin’s voting record may be one
of the least liberal in Washington, but
does that: make it one of the worst? I
hardly think so. If Martin’s voting
record showed a high percentage of
absences on crucial votes, then maybe
it could be called one of the worst in
Washington.

McKelway called the ninth district

“‘one of the most backward and
morally dull districts around.’’ How a
district can be called morally dull is
beyond’ me. I can understand how a
district can be moral, immoral, or
amoral, but morally dull? Does a
morally exciting district have bars on
every corner? Whether morals are dull
or exciting does not seem to me to be
a very important campaign issue
anyway.

Housing funds wasted

To the Editor:

I was appalled to read in last week’s
Davidsonian that the estimated reno-
vation cost of the Carnegie Guest
House was close to two hundrea
thousand dollars.

Now, I have nothing against CGH.
It’s a downright decent-looking edi-
fice, emminently worthy of gracing
the Davidson College campus. But is
a year in which the annual student
housing crunch was felt more severely
than ever before, I seriously question
the justification of this expense.

If the College Administration elects
to continue its present policy of

increasing student enrollment while
failing to provide an adequate in-
crease in much-needed student hous-
ing, plain common sense indicates
that the crunch this Fall was merely
the tip of the iceberg that looms in
front of us,

Frankly, I feel that if the College
was going to deal with housing of any
kind, it could have at least given some
consideration to the students who
reside here three terms out of the
year, rather than to fly-by-night
guests. Clearly, there is more of a
need for student housing than for an
impressive, though impractical,
Davidson Hilton.

I strqngly suggest that the Admin-
istration reassess its apparent priori-
ties. Two hundred thousand dollars
could have gone a long way towards
preventing the housing screw-ups
that occurred this Fall.

Religious jokes make
the familiar ‘strange’

To the Editor:

Here’s some Good Friday grafitti...

“Jesus was a party-pooper; Christ
passes out noise-makers, balloons,
and three-day suckers.”’

‘‘Jesus bore a heavy cross; the
cross of Christ is balsa.”’

“Jesus lorded over us; Christ sets
us free.”

“Jesus scalped tickets for the last
boat to the Promised Land; it’s a free
ride with Christ.”’

“Jesus threw the good book at us;
Christ throws it ba
‘‘Jesus never cracked a smile;
Christ has us rolling in the pews.”

P.S. Balmer, have we succeeded in
making the familiar strange?

McKelway also said, ‘‘I don’t think
churches and educational institutions

have done a very good job of

educating the people on where their
interests lie.” This is utterly ridicu-
lous. The church’s and school’s job is
to alert the people to the choices, not
to tell them where their interests lie.
For Dr. McKelway to assume that he
should educate the people on where
their interests lie is preposterous. The
whole American way of life is based
on freedom of choice, not having a
church or school tell us what to do.

The right to freedom of.opinion and
freedom to express that opinion are
two of the most important truths in
the American legal system. However,
these rights can be abused, and in a
way that the harm comes not to the
abuser, but to someone completely

unaware of the situation. In this case,

the harm came tothe students and
faculty who do not agree with Dr.

McKelway's thought, but who are
now linked to it. I sincerely hope this
type of situation will not happen
again.

Fascism might return

To the Editor:

Last Thursday night I had the

doubtful pleasure to enjoy a show
called Fireman. I don’t think it is
necessary to repeat what happened,
but a few words of comment may be
allowed. Nothing has to be said about
Fireman himself; he was the harmless
part of the story. I’m talking about
those guys who played Goebbels and
Hitler—and about all the others who
seemed to have a good time yelling
‘Heil Hitler’’ in the admittedly
proper manner. All this, also the
burning of the books—like the whole
business supposedly meant as an act
of compensating frustration—were
obviously very significant features of
the national socialistic movement in
Germany. What was happening be-
fore Belk on Thursday night reminded
me and a lot of other Daivdson
students of fascism-in Germany and
Italy forty years ago.

I was standing before Belk watch-
ing what was going on and couldn’s
say a word, I was shocked! I have the
suspicion that those people really
didn't understand what they were
doing. They were playing fascism! No
one seemed to be aware of the fact

that they were creating the,same kind
of mass movement that led the
German-and Italian peoples into
national socialism, only on a smaller
scale though.
The whole world saw what h

ed under Hitler and Mussolini, the
whole world suffered from fascism—
aware of its danger. Worshipping a
Fuhrer, yelling slogans, burning
books —thses things were part of a
psychological, social and political
phenomenon which seems to be so

night showed us that this is the last
thing we can be sure of.
