Steinbrenner s On The Loose Again

By ANDY BARRON

Baseball season is fully underway as
of last Sunday. I realize Opening Day
came three weeks earlier, but only now
do I feel the national pastime is moving
full speed through another season. What
sparked my awakening? Why none other
than George Steinbrenner. Yes, folks,
George has fired his manager and
brought in, you'll never guess so I'll tell
you, Billy Martin. Big surprise, eh?

No baseball season can be considered
genuine until George either fires or hires,
or both for that matter, Billy Martin.
Now the newspapers will be marked by
Billy and George's escapades for as long
as Martin stays on as skipper of the Yan-
kees. I can’t imagine Martin finishing out
the year. But then again, I said the Philies
would finish second in the NL East.

Mr. Steinbrenner’s various stupid re-
marks and manager changes of the last
seven or eight years have rarely done
anything but make me chuckle. I despise
the Yankees and love to see them mired
in turmoil. This change is different. I'd

rather see Billy Martin in a Lite Beer
commercial than a dugout anyday, espe-
cially if the dugout he took over used to
belong to Yogi Berra. I can’t believe
Yogi’s gone after only 16 games. It isn’t
Yogi's fault the Yankees have no pitch-
ing or that New York plays in baseball's
best division. Heck, the Yankees are only
four and a half games out of first place
with 146 games to go in the season. Good
luck dealing with Dave Winfield and Ric-
key Henderson, Billy, not to mention
boss George. Enjoy this stint and we'll
see you again in two years.

The Baltimore Orioles briefly ended
the Detroit Tigers’ hold on first in the AL
East. The Tigers were in first place
through the entire 1984 season and
jumped into first place again this year by
winning their first six games. When the
Orioles grabbed first place by a half game
last week, the Tigers’ string of about 200
straight season days in first place ended.
Unfortunately for Baltimore, Detroit was
back on top after only a couple of days.

The 1985 baseball season looks like a
promising year for milestones and big
years for plenty of players. Of course,
every year has its April heroes who suffer
a June-swoon into obscurity. Yet I can’t
get over the Braves’ Dale Murphy. With
one game remaining in April, Murphy
had 9 home runs and 27 RBI's. I'm sure
not even the most devoted of Murphy’s
disciples feel he will maintain his present
pace and get 8! homers and 243 ribbies.
But just think of the excitement, and
pressure, that would occur if Murphy
made a run at Roger Maris’ record 61
home runs in a season. Murphy needs
three things to do the impossible: good
health, Bob Homer, and a little luck. Just
for the record, the RBI record belongs to
Hack Wilson with 190.

Dale Murphy isn’t the only hot power
hitter in this young season. Oakland’s
Mike Davis also has nine homeruns as of
the end of April. In my opinion, Mr.
Davis seems far more likely to suffer a
fall from springtime glory than Mr. Mur-
phy. Right now, Roger Maris has several

pursuers, but only time will tell.

Ozzie Smith should not be making $2
million a year. Most baseball salaries are
out of line, but Smith's is ridiculous.
There are at least two, and maybe three
shortstops I'd rather have than the so-
called “Wizard of Oz.” Baltimore's Cal
Ripken, Jr. and Detroit’s Alan Trammel
field on the same level as Smith, hit far
better than Smith does, and cost a whole
lot less. An owner could have both Rip-
ken and Trammel for $700,000 less than
Smith. I might even place Milwaukee’s
Robin Yount ahead of Smith at the posi-
tion of shortstop. No matter how great a
defender Smith is, he’d have to turn a
double play every inning to make up for
his non-existent bat. The Cardinals
would have been better off re-signing
Bruce Sutter.

Steinbrenner’s insane, Billy Martin is
back, Murphy’s hot, and salaries con-
tinue to rise at a ridiculous rate. Yes sir, it
certainly is good to know baseball hasn’t
changed.

Davidson Rugby Team
Finishes Season

By PERRY MATHEWES

This past Saturday the rugby club
finished its season with a 9-0 defeat at the
hands of the ruggers of Belmont Abbey.
This dropped the team's final record to 2-5.
Davidson beat Belmont twice while losing
to the tough teams of UNC-G, Charlotte
Olde-Originals B-side and Cherry Point.

The highlight of the season came on the
weekend of March 30-31 when Davidson
participated in the Round Rockin’ Robin
Tournament in Charlotte, playing three
games in two days. Saturday morning Dan
River beat Davidson 16-0, but Davidson
came back in the afternoon, beating Bel-
mont Abbey by scoring a try in the last 30
seconds of the game.

Sunday the Mannes of Cherry Point
beat Davidson 10-8 in a tough, grinding
game. Penalties due to inexperience hurt
the team as Cherry Point scored six points
on two penalty goals

Senior Ben Pope anchored the scrum
this spring, which got strong performances
from various other players as well. Hard-
hitting junior Chris Klett and senior Joe
McMullen led the bucks.

Senior Jim Bruggeman, who played
scrum half most of the season, provided
most of the leadership for the team. His
knowledge of game and motivational skills
enabled him to prepare the team for hard-
hitting games. Davidson will be hard-
pressed to find a leader as capable as him.
