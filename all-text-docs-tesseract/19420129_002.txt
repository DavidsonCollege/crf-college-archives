GET “FIT TO FIGHT”

With Charles Adas-like promises of
physical titness in an amazingly short
period of time, the student body heard
the proposal for a new athletic program
to be offered this semester. Some per-
sons in this student body, regretfully
we fecl, have an inherent disgust for
any new policy that originates on the
campus. The thoughts of deeper think-
ers will ultimately overshadow these,
“progress hinderers,” and the program
will be adopted with enthusiasm.

At the Association of American -Col-
leges and Universities in America this
year was forwarded a plan for the gov-
ernment's enforcing a nationwide col-
icgiate program to ‘require so many
hours of exercise for every American
college student. This plan has not as
yet been adopted of course. and one
main argument against it is that col-
leges will automatically adopt physical
development programs without direction
from the government. Davidson Col-
lege is reacting favorably to this pro-
posal. t

The plan of the Physical Educat
Department is to make the program
universal and interesting to all ranks of
athletes_by segregating the more _ad-
vanced in one particular sport from the
heginners.

“We don't care whether a fellow has
Leen in a gymnasium before in his life.”
declared Coach Shepard in regard to the
qualiieations of a person before entering
in to the plan. “We won't embarass
anybody and well have something for
everybody to do and exeell in.’ Tn
other words, the program is not only
for the persons who are already experts,
in certain sports, nor does it attempt
10 interiere with the present set-up of
inter-class and inter-fraternity compe-
tition. This new phase of athletic par-
ticipation is designed to include those
persons who are not taking part in vear--
round sports activity.

In a way the plan is definitely a break
for the men who have always wanted to
go out for sports, but who have been
afraid of the embarrassment of not being
any too skilled in tit. And yet the exer-
cises to be given are tobe vigoréus
enough to actually develop neglected
muscles. A progressive program prom-
ises to condition men s0 all will be able_
to do the most strenuous exercises.

As a matter of fact, a glance in the
catalog shows that a four-year physical
education course for students not taking
R. O. T. C. is written in thecurricular
requirements. ;

What better thing can college students
do in preparation for war than becoming
physically fit to fight? Is an hour a day
too much to ask you to volunteer toward
your own self-improvement ?
