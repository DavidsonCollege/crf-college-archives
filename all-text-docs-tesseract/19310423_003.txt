B. B. SHOTS

By B. B. SUGG

Following yesterday’s game with Duke
University, which had not been played as
this issue went to press, cries of “peanuts,

cigars, cigarettes, candy, and cold drinks”.

at varsity ball games played at Davidson
were temporarily silenced until 1932. The
remaining games on the varsity schedule
will be played on the opposing teams’
home grounds.

However, during the first two weeks of
May, the Freshmen have several other
teams to meet here, which will undoubted-
ly be of interest to the student body in
enabling them to observe prospects for
the 1932 season.

Upon observing the games played last
week, when the varsity won only one of
three games, the need for hurlers has be-
come more and more apparent. However,
we believe that the elimination of fre-
quent miscues by the infield would
strengthen the team to a great extent.

Lefty Thompson’s pitching against Le-
noir Rhyne was way above par, and the
best that Davidson fans have been per-
mitted to see this season. We like the way
Lefty works; he wastes no time, and
when he pitches, they usually split the
plate.

Incidentally, with track practice con-
stantly going on during games, we won-
der that a pitcher is able to tell whether
he is in a ball game or a track meet. Fans,
too, are sometimes bothered by observing
the game through a haze of track uni-
forms. In the same manner, track meets
are sometimes hindered greatly by balls
knocked out in baseball practice, and no
one wouldn be at all surprised: to see a
runner in the 440 come sliding into the
tape in the attempt to beat out.a ball roll-
ing down the track ahead of him.

Nab Armfield has been doing excel-
excellent catching behind the bat, and has
seldom been seen to miss a pitched ball.
Proctor, also, on the i itial sack, rarely
fails to rake ’em in if they are in reason-
able reach. And when a ball is knocked
into center field, Bradsher never misses.
He covers territory all the way from
second base to the hedge fence, and let’s
’em fall softly in the old “tar bucket.”

With wins over Wake Forest and South
Carolina, and a loss to Duke by a scant
margin of two points, the Wildcat track
team has been clicking excellently. Since
their win over South Carolina last Sat-
urday by a margin of over 50 points, and
since South Carolina beat Furman: by
slightly less than the same score, we
figure that the ’Cats are about 90 points
better than Furman.

Alec Earle evidently runs by machinery.
He takes first place in the mile run, take
a workout of three or four laps, and then
wins first in the two mile. Whataman! It
seems that we'll have a man to replace
Soup Brannon, whose consistent winning
so far has been indispensable in winning
meets. We'd like to have a. nickel for
every time Soup and Alec have circled the
track.

The weakest spot on the team seems to
be in the high jump event. A second place
in this event would have been sufficient
margin to win the Duke meet for us, but
the. Davidson jumpers were unable to
come through, and Duke won all three
places.

Grimey George has consistently taken
first place in the high and low hurdles in
all meets, and also placed second in the
hundred yard dash against South Caro-
lina last Saturday. His running of the
high hurdles, his specialty, is a superb
exhibition of perfect hurdling.

Saturday’s track meet with V. M. I.
should be a close and interesting meet,
and providing old man Pluvious holds
back his weekly torrents, which he has
not done for the last nine consecutive Sat-

Fleagle and Earle of Davidson, and
Bostick of South Carolina Featur
in Meet ‘

Davidson's. track team won its second meet
of the week last Saturday on Richardson
Field by overwhelming the University of
South Carolina cindermen, 89% to 361%4. The
Wildcats took first place in ten of the four-
teen events and tied for first in another;
while in four events they took all three
places.

Fred Fleagle, Davidson dash ace, featured
the victory by taking first place in each of
the three events he entered, and scored 15
points for the Wildcats to earn individual
honors. George, also of Davidson, scoring
13 points, came in second in the 100-yard
dash, and won both hurdle events.

The running of Earle also featured the
meet. The Wildcat distance man came in
second in the mile run and then stepped out
to win first honors in the two-mile ‘run, bare-
ly nosing out Brannon.

Bostick, of South Carolina, showed class
in the high jump. After tying with Dupree,
a teammate, for first honors, he gave an ex-
hibition in which he cleared the bar at six
feet. Bostick, with eight points, was also
high scorer for the losers.

Despite a slow track caused by rains, the
time in several of the events were rather
fast.

Summary :

100-yard dash — Fleagle (Davidson) ;
George (Davidson); Duvall (South Caro-

Guilford Quakers Crush
Wildcats by 6-2 Score

The Davidson baseball nine tasted rather
hitterly of defeat at the hands of the Guilford
Quakers here last Friday, the 17th, when
the Quakers came out with the big end of a
6 to 2 score.

Both teams took advantage of bobbles and
temporary wildness to score their tallies,
for there was only one run earned in the
whole tilt, and it was made in the ninth in-
ning by the Guilfordians. The visitors scored
four runs. on three hits coupled with two
errors made by the Wildcats; a walk, and a
hit hatsman in the first two. innings, at
which time Bailey was relieved by Croker.
In the. remaining seven innings Croker al-
lowed only six hits, which he kept well scat-
tered. Nelson, the Quaker heaver, let only
seven men: pass first base during the entire
nine innings.

Univ. of S. C. Defeated
By Wildcat Cindermen

Wildcat Nine Loses
To N. C. State, 9-2

Visitors Score Nine Runs on Eight
Safe Blows

On Monday, April 20, Davidson College’s
baseball team lost to N. C. State by a score
of 9 to 2. Although the visitors garnered
only eight safe hits off Mathis and Bailey
during the game, they were given eleven free
passes by the two Davidson pitchers, and
the team muffed four times to add to State’s
score.

Lanning hurled excellent ball for State
throughout the entire nine innings, ‘allowing
only seven hits and keeping them well scat-
tered. He held Davidson scoreless for seven
innings when the only error made by State
was made by Wilkie, followed by Whitley’s
double which brought in the score. David-
son’s other tally came in the eighth on two
singles.

State scored in the first frame, a base on
balls, a sacrifice by Wilkie, and a hit by
Morris for the first score. They scored twice
in the second, twice in the fifth, and four
times in the eighth.

Morris obtained three of the eight hits al-
lowed his teammates, and Bernhardt and
Goodson divided four of Davidson's seven
total.
