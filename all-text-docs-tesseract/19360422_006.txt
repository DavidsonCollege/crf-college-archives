The Reverend Peter Marshall was
the guest minister at the Vespers

from Hebrews 11:8 and Psalm 31.:-
14-15.

To the Christian Students of Dav-
idson College:

Every Christian should send out
light, . especially now. Christian
business men should be as much
“Christian” as “business.” The same
with men in all employments. The
Master is looking for “little can-
dles shining in the night, you in
your small corner, and I in mine,’
but not at Davidson College—here,
not even for 50-watt and 60-watt
lamps. The present darkness needs
great light—He is looking for you,
1000-watt men, and 1,500-watt men.

“Ye are the light of the world,”
—not “under a bushel, but on a
candle stick.” Being privileged to
attend Davidson College is like be-
ing set on a candle stick. The can-
dle stick, also the candle, are sim-
ply ornamental unless there is ligh
