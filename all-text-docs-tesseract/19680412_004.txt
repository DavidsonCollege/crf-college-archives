The Davidson sailing team
finished a very close third in
its own invitational regatta
last Saturday at the lake
campus.

Finishing only one point
behind second-place Citadel

and two points behind first
place South Carolina, David-
son's 59 points was far ahead
of the remainder of the sev-

Goodbye, West Virginia |

West Virginia called it quits last week. Maybe the
Southern Conference basketball tournament loss to
Davidson had something to do with it but it wasn’t
mentioned at Morgantown in a statement to the press.
The school decided they were not happy with the con-
ference and dropped out to become an independent.

Reasons such as “We are too far away from the
other conference schools to travel economically,” and
“We want to expand our athletic programs more na-
tionally,” were stated, but the real reason could be
that West Virginia University was tired of being as-
sociated with the name, the Southern Conference.

For a certain number of years, the SC has been
looked down upon by the larger school leagues, such
as the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Southeastern
Conference. This prejudice has certain legitimate
grounds, because most of the SC schools are small and
cannot support a “high power” subsdiized athletic
program in all sperts. But trying to keep from sounding
like a “Blue Sky report” on athletics, many of the SC
schools besides Davidson have had nationally known
athletic teams withoiut subsidization.

lt appears WVU wants a chance to choose which
small SC schools to play. The SC scheduling rules if
nothing else seem to be the real thorn WVU wanted
to remove. More than basketball, the WVU football
program wanted to have a wider choice in scheduling
opponents. In the past a certain number of their foot-
ball games had to be with SC teams to make them
eligible for the league title. Now they can “move on to
bigger and better things” or so they say. It will be
interesting to see hwo their season record turns out
against the “big league.”

‘m sure after the last basketball season. they
don’t consider Davidson “bush league.” Lefty said it
really didn’t make that much difference to him either
way. “West Virginia will get a better chance at the
national tournament by being an independent. They
won't have to go through our tough 3-day tournament,”
he said. With Ron Williams graduating, the Mountain-
eers would have a hard time beating many of the SC
basketball teams beside Davidson next year.

Football at WVU isn’t that much better than the
rest of the league if this was the reason for their pull-
ing out. The growing football programs of most of the
SC schools besides the established strerigth of East

Carolina has and would not make an easy schedule for
WVU. The more you study the matter, it is hard to
determine whether WVU athletics are moving on to
“bigger things” or just “chickening out” by choosing
weak teams in other conferences. This is what the
Houston basketball team did to a certain extent this
last season.

Possibly minor sports at WVU will improve with
added teams from other conferences on their respec-
tive schedules. The Mountaineers sure won't miss the
Davidson baseball team as any great power they should
play to gain prestige in the national picture. They will
be able to schedule better track, swimming, and soc-
cer teams outside of the conference if they plan to
expand these programs, but wrestling and especially
tennis is another matter. Like Davidson, most of the
SC schools produce fine wrestling and tennis teams.
Probably, WVU wants only to play the best the SC has
to offer in these Sports instead of all the league teams.

Well, probably WVU will find better competition
among certain large schools, and maybe their athletic
programs will improve because of this, but I don't
think their newly acquired status as an independent
will bring them any athletic prestige they could not
have earned in the Southern Conference. The confer-
ence will miss the WVU Mountaineer teams as strong
competitors, but I know most SC fans won't lose any
sleep over their departure. In fact, one Davidson stu-
dent’s reaction sums it up. ‘Good riddance.”

Now, at least George Washington can make the
SC basketball tournament next year no matter what
their record.

for the afternoon with 22
points. Team captain Tom
Kirtley and Jim Lee had 14
points each, while freshman
Lewis Riley picked up nine:

One of the reasons for the
good showing of the David-
son team was its ability to
keep from fouling out of any
of the races while fouling out
several other boats.

Every team member par-
ticipated in at least one
race, as four different skip-
pers raced. Although this
may hurt the team's chanc-
es of winning the regatta, it
gave valuable experience to
an inexperienced team.

The team chose its offi-
cers for next year early this
week. Three rising sopho-
mores took the offices, as
John Moore was elected cap-
tain. with Roger Powell and.
Lewis Riley being elected
secretary and treasurer.

The next regatta facing
the team is the South At-
lantic Intercollegiate Sailing
Association finals, to be held
next weekend in Charleston.

Davidson Gains
Ohio Gridders

Davidson football picked up two sizeable additions

to its freshman roster

or next season, as two Ohio high

school stars signed grid grants-in-aid this week.

Frank McLaughlin, a tackle from Oregon, Ohio,
and an end from Mansfield, Jim Ellison, both signed

early this week.

53 Report
For Spring
Workouts

Spring football practice be-
gan in the mud yesterday as
53 gridders put on the pads
for reconditioning.

The coaching staff, under
Head Coach Homer Smith, is
faced with n difficult task
this spring, due to the unex-
pected departure of Assistant
Coach Warner Alford, who
left the staff to assume a
similar position at Georgia
Tech.

The team will work on va-
rious weak areas in hopes of
building a strong squad for
next season.

The practice, which will
continue until May 15, will
be climaxed by an intra-
squad game on May Il.

Smith said that the prac-
tice will concentrate specif-
ically on two areas. The big
task will be the development
of a novice offensive line.
which will find junior center
Sandy Brenneman as_ the
only returnee.

Lindsey Bishop, a starter
last year at offensive guard
will not see action this year
due to injuries sustained in
the West Virginia game.

Hank Strickland, another
interior lineman, will also be
missing from the Wildcat
lineup. Strickland plans to
skip his senior year at Da-
vidson to go on to dental
school.

The other concentrated ef-
fort will be placed on work-
ing in sophomore quarter-
back Gordon Slade as a re-
placement for Jimmy Poole.

Several colleges in the
Carolinas have already com-
pleted their drilis for this
spring. while most will be
completed early next month.
The Davidson starting and
concluding dates are later
than the rest of the South-
ern Conference teams’ dates.

McLaughlin is one of the
biggest boys to sign with Da-
vidson. At 6-3, 230 pounds,
he will play offensive tackle.

Assistant Coach Warner
Alford, who recruited both
boys. said that he “has the
size and speed which we are
looking for in an interior
lineman.’

Ellison is a_ 6-foot, 190
pound offensive end. who
comes from what Alford de-
scribes as an ‘‘outstanding
football program.” ry

Alford said, ‘We are thrill-
ed to have twe more boys
from this area. The athletes
from Ohio have contributed
tremendously to Wildcat foot
tremendously to Wildcat foot-
ball."

WARNER ALFORD

n Leads Cindermen

As Top Davidson Sprinter

By DOUG HAYNES
Sports Writer

Rick Lyon appears to be
one of those few individuals
who has the sort of dedica-
tion necessary to participate
in both varsity track and
spring football practice and
to do both successfully.

A freshman from Wheat-
on, Iil., Lyon has been a con-
sistent winner this spring in
his events,. the 100 and 220
yard dashes. .

At 5-10, 170 pounds, Lyon
has the impressive build of a
sprinter, and sprint he does.
He has been defeated only
once in dual meets this sea-
son.

Just prior to spring break.
he turned in his most im-
pressive performance at the
News Piedmont Relays in
Greenville, S. C. Running
against entries from over 30
colleges and universities, he
finished fourth with a clock-
ing of 9.5.

Lyon said that he has been
quite pleased with his per-
formances this spring. ‘I’m
running faster than I did last
year,” he said. “I finished
second in the Illinois state
meet last year with a 9.6,
but I was also very incon-
sistent all season.”

“This year I've settled
down,"’ he said, and I can
now consistently run 9.8 or
9.9."°

Rick seems to prefer the

220 to the 100 yard dash, due

“i
POWER START
-.. Lyon’s off
to “a little trouble on the
starts in the 100. His best
clocking in the 220 this year
has been a 22.1.
When not burning up the

cinders, Rick finds himself
earning his football scholar-
ship at flanker and defens-
ive halfback on Coach Hom-
er Smith's squad.

Rick noted that spreading
himself out between football
and track keeps him from
his best performance in
track, but added, “I like both
sports a lot. One sport is
completely individual while
the other as a team sport."’

“I'm happy at whichever
one I'm doing at the time,”’
he said. ‘Perhaps football
will keep me from reaching
what I could otherwise in
track. but you just can’t
train completely for two
sports.”

His goal for this track sea-
son is a good finish in the
Southern Conference meet
next month in Fort Eustis,
Va. He added, however, that
he was not in “good enough
shape yet."’

Wonder what his defeated
opponents would say to that.

Assistant Football Coach
Warner Alford, who came to
Davidson last year as a de-
fensive specalist, has resign-
ed hs position here to as-
sume a similar job at Geor-
gia Tech.

Alford will take a position
as defensive assistant and
recruiter for the Yellow
Jackets.

He based his decision on
the financial offer from
Tech, which he described as
“just too good to pass up.”

Head Football Coach Hom-
er Smith said this week that
Alford’s decision came as ‘‘a
shock and surprise, especial-
ly since spring football prac-
tice starts this week.”

Smith praised Alford's
work with the Wildcat de-

Smith plans to place As-
sistant Coach Dave Fagg,
offensive line coach this
year, in the position left va-

cant by Alford. He said that
this move was to insure that
the Wildcat defensive prog-
ress was not hindered.

Several men are under
consideration for the vacated
post, according to Smith, but
no replacement has been
found.
