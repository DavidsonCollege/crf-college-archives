TRIPLE NUMBER OF BOOKS

New Library Called For

By TOM CRAIG
Davidsonlan Associate Editor

A sweeping recommendation
for an entirely new library fa-
cility and rapid tripling of cur-
rent library holdings highlights
the Self Study Library Com-
‘mittee’s report.

In a 25-page, 18-recommenda-
tion report, the 10-man commit-
tee released the findings of its
exhaustive and thorough study.

As bases for its recommenda-
tions, committee members inter-

Vespers To Feature
Drama Production

The Theater Arts 31 class,
under the supervision of Assist-
ant Drama Professor Rupert T.
Barber. will present an unusual
dramatic production at Vespers
Sunday night.

The play entitled ‘It Should
Happen to a Dog” is a retelling
of the story of Jonah, written
by Wolf Mankowitz. The author
calls the play a_ sefio-comic
strip. This is evident, accord-
ing to Barber, in the colorful
but unrealistic costumes and
scenery. These make the play
resembie a comic strip.

The one-act play with five
short scenes ranges from in-
side Jonah’s shop to the whale's
belly to Nineveh. The staging
is patterned after the old Chi-
nese method in which the prop-
erty man moves the scenery
around but is pretended to be
invisible by the audience.

Mankowitz explains the mes-
sage of the play in the introduc-
tion. ‘This is, one hopes, how
God feels about Man—unlike
Man who is less tolerant of him-
self.”

The cast includes Pat Hub-
bard as Jonah, George Brewer
as a man, Stu Burness and
Howard Bryan as sailors, Phil
Hightower as a king and Rawley
Turner as the Angel. Produc-
tion assistants are Don Davis,
lighting: Vince Foster, cos-
tumes: Charlie Parker, sets and
properties: and Vonnie Hicks,

viewed students, faculty and es-
pecially library staff members.
It compiled information secur-
ed in a general library use and
_ adequacy questionnaire answer-
ed by 100 students and 65 fac-
ulty members.
QUESTIONNAIRE

Another questionnaire was
completed by 28 of the leading
liberal arts schools in the coun-
try, in which each described its
library facilities and expendi-
tures.

Numerous surveys were con-
ducted and observations made
by committee members inside
the library building itself. The
report is purely their own rec-
ommendations, and is not be
considered as an official faculty.
administration or library staff
policy.

In the committee report, the
current library staff was judged
efficient, but not numerous
enough. As there is currently
no professional librarian in
charge of the government docu-
ment depository and no one li-
brarian specifically in charge
of reference assistance, the.
committee feels that a profes-
sional librarian skilled in these
areas should be employed im-
mediately.

INCREASED STAFF

The committee realizes also
that large increases in both pro-
fessional and non-professional
staff will be necessary as the li-
brary develops.

The director of the library
now also serves as half-time
professor of history; he has no
secretary; he is not on duty
in the summer months and he
is the only member of the li-
brary staff who has faculty
rank, salary and privileges.

FULL-TIME DIRECTOR

The committee recommends
that the position of director of
the library be a full-time posi-
tion without teaching responsi-
bilities.

As regards library staffers’
salaries, the committee notes
that although Standard Nine of
the Southern Association of Col-
leges and Schools states that
[all professional librarians

should have faculty rank, com-
parable salaries and privileges,”
the three current library depart-
ment heads receive salaries
lower than the beginning salary
of the lowest faculty rank.

The committee thus recom-
mends that professional libra-
rians serving as department
heads be paid salaries in the
assistant professor range, and
that other professional librarians
be paid salaries in the instruc-
tor range.

NEW LIBRARY

One of the most striking pro-
posals of the entire Self Study
was made by the Library Com-
mittee. At the end of its ex-
haustive study of current li-
brary plant and facilities, the
committee recommends _ that

‘planning begin immediately for

a whole new library facility, to
be planned by a_ nationally-
known library consultant.

The committee's decision to
request a new building was
made when the present build-
ing’s practical capacity of 175.-
000 volumes was determined
wholly inadequate for a ‘‘first
class liberal arts college."’ A col-
lection’ of 300.000 volumes was
considered a good goal for Dav-
idson. ‘

Not only inadequate book
space prompted the request for
a new building. The commit-
tee found only 251 of the li-
brary’s 319 study spaces effi-
ciently usuable. Numerous car-
rels and certain other areas
were ruled inadequately lighted.

MORE BOOKS

-As a stop-gap measure until a
new building can be completed,
the committee recommends that
a program be begun to add 25.-
000 ‘‘carefully selected’ books
to the Nbrary each year for a
period of eight years.

During the same period it is
suggested that 125 journals be
added annually, and that back
issues be obtained on micro-
film for all journals no longer
available.

The current library budget.
though handsomely augmented
in recent years (from. $87,377 in
1963-64 to $170,305 in 1965-66),

Freshman Debate Team
Places Third At Georgia

Davidson's new debate coach,
Ray McMillin, watched his win-
ning novice team bring home
the first trophy of the season the
weekend of Nov. 19 and 20.

Due to “‘cut’ problems aris-
ihg from the limitations of Hu-
manities 11, the team = car-
ried only the affirmative mem-
bers of the team, Charles Eakes
and Fletcher Hartsell. Traveling
to the University of Georgia on
Friday, the team met and de-
feated Anderson College, Wil-
liam and Mary and the Univer-
sity of Georgia.

In sweeping the first day's
debates, Davidson was power
matched on Saturday facing

Morehead State, University of
Florida and Agnes Scott. Losing
only to Morehead State (the
champion negative team), Dav-
idson finished with an overall
record of five wins and one loss
and thereby won the third place
affirmative trophy.

To date, the team of Eakes
and Hartsell has compiled a 14-4
record, best among those of
either varsity or novice at Dav-
idson.

When asked about upcoming
events, Coach McMillin announc-
ed that the varsity team con-
sisting of Tom Rhodes and
Greg Haynes would participate
in a tournament at Princeton

sion in holdings. Volume ac-
quisitions have risen sharply re-
cently, from 4,211 in 1962-63 to

LIBRARY COMPARISONS

At the end of its report, the
committee compared Davidson's
library with those of other strong
liberal arts colleges. In fig-
ures gathered for 1962-63, the
report notes that of 28 colleges
contacted, Davidson has _ the
smallest number of books. The
report found that Davidson is
tied for last with Wabash in the
number of periodicals taken by
its library, it is in 26th place in
library expenditure per student
and it is tied for 22nd place
in the per cent of the college
budget used for the library.

In making its recommenda-
tions, the committee states that
they feel that a strong library
is a vital part of making David-
son ‘‘the best college of its type
—in all of America.”

GETTING READY FOR A WEDDING |

Cottege workmen were busy this week preparing a new walk-
way along the west or side entrance to the Guest House.

When asked what occasioned

the new walkway leading to

the ilftie-used side door, one of the workmen replied, “Well,
you know there's going to be a wedding around here pretty

soon.’ He's right.

Embry, is engaged to be ‘married to a Davidson alumnus

during the Christmas holidays.

If Cycle Completes Self

By BILL SEIGLER
Davidsonian Staff Writer
Along with the usual ills that
plague the Davidson student,
the undergraduate may now
have to endure yet another

trauma: an epidemic of flu.

Flu, like most virus infec-
tions, travels in cycles, and this
is the third year of the three-
year cycle of flu which normally
strikes the United States.

To find out what dangers
might face the college student
this year, THE DAVIDSONIAN
contacted Dr. J. B. Woods, col-
lege physician.

Although this is the third year
in the cycle, Woods related,
there have not been any epi-
demics reported as yet. Normal-
ly when there is to be an epi-
demic in the United States, it
is preceded by one in Asia or
Europe which is carried to
America by travelers.

Since no such epidemic has
thus far been reported, Woods
advises the students ‘‘not to
be too concerned.”" ‘‘Your guess
is as good as mine as to wheth-
er or not it's going to hit us,”
he concluded. “‘But remember,
this is the third year.”

The vaccine, Woods commeni-

Theatre Of Concern

“A collection of short plays,
sketches and theatre pieces
about an hour long or so and dif-
ferent from time to time, some
memorized. some improvised
and some just unprepared,” and
that’s all.

It is called the Theatre of
Concern. formed in 1962 by Nor-
man and Sandra Dietz, and will
be presented in chapel on Thurs-
day, December 9, by the YMCA.
It will be followed by another
performance that evening at 7:30
p.m. in the Morrison Room.

The Theatre of Concern is a
traveling, professional, modern
theatre which often consists of
only two players and usually fits
into one suitcase.

It is “an attempt to utilize
the playing of players as an ex-
pression of care about people,
about what it means to be a
person,’’ by using the stage as
a forum for ideas and ‘‘an
arena for personal concern ex-

: | pressed through common joyful

celebration of the ultimate mys-
tery of life.”

This mystery is defined by the
Theatre as ‘‘a confidence in the
continuing. a continually mys-
terious, validity of the life of
Jesus Christ.”

The Theatre travels through-
out the United States, perform-
ing in churches, colleges and
universities, as well as in the-
atre workshops. In cooperation

Directory Delayed
'By Fund Shortage

A lack of advertisement
money has. brought about a
delay .in the publication of this
year’s directory. according to
Butch Allison, acting president
of Alpha Phi Omega.

Except for advertisements,
the master copy of the directory
is ready for the printers. Alli-
son. commented that some mem-
bers of Alpha Phi Omega have
been selling ads, which are nec-
essary for the procurement of
sufficient funds but that there
has been a noticeable lack of in-
terest among members.

“In the first four meetings
of this semester,” Allison Ja-
mented, ‘‘we have had a com-
bined total of about eight peo-
ple attend.”

The book will be in the hands
of the printers by Christmas at

. the latest, Allison concluded.
He added that if the advertise-
ments do come in soon, it might
be possible to get the directory
to the printers by the end of
this week and perhaps to have
them distributed before Christ-
mas.

The many electric motors in those offices
