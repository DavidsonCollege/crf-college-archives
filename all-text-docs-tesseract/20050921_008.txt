In an unprecedented Honor
Council trial, a student has been
accused of lying on a survey for a
psychology experiment. The stu-
dent, James Alder ’06, was asked
in an email to complete an online
survey for a senior psychology stu-
dent’s experiment concerning the
drug use of college students. Alder
has decided to make the trial pub-
lic as he feels he has been unfairly
accused.

“The first part of the survey
asked for your name, class year,
race, whether or not you were in a
fraternity, and other basic ques-
tions like that,” said Alder. He then
reported that the second part con-
tained questions about drug and
alcohol use and habits. He claimed
to have filled out the survey hon-
estly, although he admits that he
may have filled out one question in
jest.

Alder said, “Question 22 asked
‘Sex?’, and I put ‘no thanks.’ I like
to joke around every now and
then. I think they wanted you to

Pay-to-play tuition scheme hits science majors Author ofpolice

Davidson College has recently
announced a new tuition structure
separating the prices of science
courses from non-science courses
for the spring semester 2006.
Expensive lab equipment and
rising insurance costs for pre-
med students have forced
tuition costs up for a number
of years. While the administra-
tion had previously split costs
equally among all students,
they will now be applied fully
to the science majors that use
them the most. The expected
price tag of being a Chemistry,
Biology, or Physics major next
semester is projected to be
$386,789, while non-science
majors’ tuition will fall to $86.

Assistant Dean of Financial Aid
Kim Rogers said that the switch
makes sense for a number of rea-
sons, “Microscopes and Petri dish-
es are not cheap. We decided that
we had to be fair to students study-
ing disciplines like English and
sociology, and stop charging them
for equipment that they are not

using. Plus, most of these science
kids are becoming doctors; they
will be able to afford the higher
prices easier than someone who’s
planning on becoming a high

school teacher after graduation.”
Davidson is following a recent
trend set by a number of other lib-
eral arts colleges over the past five
to ten years. Middlebury charged
pre-meds in excess of $500,000 a
semester last year, while anthro-
pology majors could spend the
same amount on their education as
a tank of gas.

Responses to this change in pol-
icy have obviously differed
depending on which side of the
academic fence you are on. “This
is absurd,” said Dr. Daniel
Harding, a professor in the
Biology department. “Tuition
was too high to begin with,
and these prices are just plain
exorbitant. How can you justi-
fy charging a student studying
biology the price of a new
home while you ask a political
science major to pay the bill
for a stay at the Red Roof
Inn?”

Dr. Harding’s feelings were
typical of other professors in
his department, but his col-
league, Dr. Jane Reid of the eco-
nomics department, thought oth-
erwise. “It makes economic sense
to charge the students that are
using the high-priced equipment
more than those that are not.
Perhaps students with newfound
disposable income would like to
use some of it on my new text-
book.”

put ‘male’ or ‘female’ or something
like that. If that’s
the case, definite-

ly male.”
Question 22,
however, is not

what Alder is on
trial for. The stu-
dent conducting
the survey discov-
ered that Alder
had lied on the
survey when he

- hadn’t had any heroin this week at

all, and only
twice since the
start of school.
This caused me
to suspect his
fraudulency, so
I interrogated
him about the
rest of his
answers.”

As it turned
out, the psy-
chology student
accused Alder of
lying on nearly
all of the ques-
tions involving
his drug use.
For example, on
the survey,
Alder respond-
ed ‘yes’? to a
question asking

mous, reported if he had ever

when asked “How cocaine, when

often do you shoot up heroin?”,
Alder had chosen the response,
“Frequently (several times a
week)”. “At the party,” the student
stated, “he told me that he actually

the student claimed, in fact, that
he had only tried powdered
cocaine.

“T hated turning in a fellow stu-
dent to the Honor Council,” said

the psychology major, “but lying
on a scientific survey like this
undermines the serious academic
work I was trying to do.”

Until this last year, surveys such
as the one Alder filled out, were
required to be anonymous. Citing
concerns of skewed results due to
students lying and a bored Honor
Council, the surveys this year are
no longer anonymous.

“It’s hard to prepare students for
the real world of psychological
research when they are unable to
gather accurate data,” Psychology
professor Dr. Regina Waters. “We
made students liable for their
responses this year because of just
such a circumstance.”

Alder decided to make his trial .

public because he believes he is
being overtly criminalized.

“So what if I over-exaggerated
my drug use a little?” he asked. “I
just wanted people to think I was
cooler. It worked too, I totaly had
like five people come up and ask
me for joints last weekend. And
anyways, I certainly didn’t lie
about Question 32. I do smoke
weed ‘frequently’, I blaze it up
nearly every day.”

Dlotier a chimp

Peaches the chimp, author of
Campus Police Blotter

Peaches the chimp, long-time
writer of The Davidsonian’s “cam-
pus police blotter” recently came
forth with his identity as its
author.

Known for his ability to summa-
rize otherwise insignificant police
reports in humorously obtuse and
needless language, Peaches
revealed his identity in a press
conference early Monday morning
in an effort to finally quell rumors
circulating about campus.

Having spent most of the inter-
view calmly picking lice out of his
fur, when asked to comment on his
recent revelations, Peaches began
making spitting noises and
screeching at his own shadow.

Peaches received his bachelor’s
degree in hotel management from
San Diego State, but a failed busi-
ness venture drove him to journal-
ism.

His column appears weekly in
The Davidsonian.
