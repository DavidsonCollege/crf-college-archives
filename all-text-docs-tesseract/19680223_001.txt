Davidson’s Life Preparation ‘Fairly Good’

By DICK ANDERSON
Staff Writer

Davidson does a fairly good job of pre-
paring its students for life after graduation.

That was the general opinion voiced this
week by four Davidson professors — Dr.
William B. Hight, director of student coun-
seling and associate professor of education:
Dr. John D. Kelton, professor of psychology :
Dr. Earl R. MacCormac, associate profes-
sor of philosophy: and Dr. W. G. Workman.
professor of psychology.

The professors did note some weaknesses
in the Davidson program, however.

“I am not sure whether the Davidson
student is prepared for the vdlues and at
titudes required.’ Kelton said. “If there
are not too many major chdnges in our

+ «evese

society in the next ten years, then the grad-
uates are pretty well. prepared. But if
there are major changes, then I don't know
whether they'll be well prepared or not.”

MacCormac said that he didn't think any
college did an adequate job of preparing its
students for life after graduation. ‘‘The
neglect of fine arts is a serious problem."
he said.

On the other hand. Hight and Workman
pointed to the success of Davidson grad.
uates as evidence that Davidson was doing
a good job.

“It certainly suggests that we don't handi-.
cap our students."’ Workman said.

“But.” he said. ‘‘the basic question is —
‘Is the success of our graduates due to the
kind of students we attract or to what hap

pened during the school year?’ ”

“Davidson students would cope pretty
well with the world whether they had a
Davidson education or not,"’ Kelton said.

All four professors said that they thought
that the Davidson graduates were well pre-
pared academically, pointing out that most
students go on to graduate schools and do
well.

Nonetheless, they stressed that there were
certain areas in which Davidson needed
improvement.

“One weakness is the lack of an obvious
commitment on the part of the college to
the social sciences and to social justice.”
said MacCormac. ‘You can see this just
hy the size of the political science and
sociology. departments, both of which are

small compared to some of the others.”

“We desperately need to have the ability
to appreciate another culture,’’ said Mac-
Cormac. ‘“‘And in the twentieth century it
makes a lot more sense to have the coed
system than to segregate by sexes."

‘We ought to be playing a much more
sizable role in educating Negroes if we ex-
pect to have responsible Negro leaders in
the South,” he said.

Both MacCormac and Kelton recommend-
ed integration of the educational process.
Kelton pointing out in particular the need
for interdisciplinary seminars.

Hight, Kelton, MacCormac and Workman

call said that they thought the Blue Sky

proposals would bring about considerable
improvements. .

Drink Rule Enforcement

Lacks Personnel--Burts

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

Davidson College has not
been able to implement its
policy of stricter enforcement
of the drinking regulations.

Dean of Students Richard
C. Burts said Wednesday that
this was due to unsuccessful
attempts to secure the prop-
er personnel.

The policy. announced in
December, 1966. called for
additional security officers
on weekends and other spe-
cial times to provide stricter
enforcement. Burts said that
the college had not been able
to find the right type of se-
curity officers for the job.

“We felt that it would not
be in the best interests of the
college to get just anybody,”
he said. ‘Therefore, we have
not been able to implement
the policy."

The additional security of.
ficers, from the Burns Detec-
tive Agency’s Charlotte
branch, are employed for
dance weekends to supple-
ment existing security offi-
cers, Burts said.

Their primary duties are
to check student identifica-
tions and to keep order. They
do not receive any special
instructions from the Dean's
Office, Burts said.

He also pointed out that
the rounds are made at the
fraternity court during the
night to enforce the curfew
in the fraternity houses.

“Our present security men
are doing a fine job,” he said.
“but they do not have the

time to carry out stricter en-
forcement of the drinking
rules along with their present
duties.

“If they do run across an
obvious violation of the rule.
action is taken, but we don't

send them out in search of”

violations,"’ he said.
Burts added that so far
the college has been able to

depend on the responsibility
of the student body in obey-
ing the rules.

Burts said that his office
was aware that some stu-
dents are drinking on cam-
pus, but that at present ad-
ditionai security officers have
not been found to enforce.

Selection Committee
Sets Up Procedures
To Name President

By CHARLES McEWEN
Copy Editor

As speculation about can
didates for the Davidson
presidency continues, Walter
L. Lingle Jr. and three com.
mittees set up some proce-
dures for the selection pro
cess.

In a letter to the college
community, Lingle, chairman
of the Board of Trustees and
its Presidential Nominating
Committee, said - that the
committee had compiled a
list of about 30 presidential

Social Chairmen: Parties
Expensive But Necessary

By DAVID SWEATT
Staff Writer

Off-campus fraternity par
ties are expensive, but ‘at
present there is no alterna-
tive, according to three fra-
ternity social chaitmen.

They estimated that fra
ternities spend from $800 to
$1,500 each in a single year
just for renting various places
for parties. A fraternity may
hold 13 to 16 parties a year.

Social chairmen estimated
that the average rental for
a party place is about $100.
Rents usually vary from $45
to $130 per night. Rental fees
are less at the smaller places
which can accommodate only
one fraternity.

Larger rooms bring a high-
er rent, but they offer party
space for more than one fra.
ternity.

Few party places are lo.
cated near Davidson, and
parties may be held as far
away as Statesville, Charlotte
or Concord-Kannapolis.

Steve Sands, Phi Delta
Theta social chairman, said
he believes that prices for
party rooms have increased
in recent years. He attributes
this to an increasing demand
for such facilities, accompan-
ied by the closing of some of
the lower-priced places.

Pi Kappa Alpha social
chairman Duncan McRae
complained that exhorbitant
prices are asked for mixers
at some of the places used by
fraternities. At these places
a pledge to buy mixers from
the management is a prere.
quisite for renting the facili.
ites,

According to Harry Hamil.
Sigma Chi social chairman.
there is no rule prohibiting
parties in the fraternities’
houses. No parties are held
there because of existing
rules which prohibit the con-
sumption of alcohol on cam-
pus.

Sands, McRae and Hamil
felt that the repeal of these
prohibitory rules on alcoholic
beverages would result in the
use of fraternity houses for

parties.

Cocktail parties and lawn
and patio. parties at the
houses would save hundreds
of dollars each year in the
fraternities’ social budgets,
according to all three social
chairmen.

In addition, _ fraternity
members could be saved
much of the inconvenience
and danger of driving long
distances before and after

parties, they said.

Several students are ar-
rested each year for drunken
driving while on their way to
and from the parties, the so-
cial chairmen said.

They also noted that most

-of the parties are held late

at night—after the college-
sponsored concerts—which
adds considerably to the ele
ment of danger.

Sands said that the College
Union could be much more
successful under a less strin

gent liquor rule. He cited
last weekend's Ben E. King
dance as the type of enter-
tainment that students stay
on campus for if it were not
for existing campus alcohol
consumption rules.

prospects.

The trustee committee will
meet in “early March, at
which time we hope to have
developed much more com-
plete and systematic informa
tion about the prospects on
our list,’ Lingle said.

The trustee committee has
set no definite time limit in
which it expects to select
and secure a new president,
according to Lingle. A time
limit “could be detrimental
to our ability to obtain the
best man.”

At a joint meeting of the
trustee committee, the Fac.
ulty Advisory Committee and
the Student Advisory Com.
mittee Feb. 12. the three
agreed not to issue any pub
lic statements of their pro-
gress.

‘Lingle listed. four reasons
for this action:

— The people whom the
committees will ask for can-
did opinions about a particu-
lar presidential prospect ‘are
not likely to be candid unless

, they feel sure that their opin.

ions will be held in complete

UNC's Phillips:
‘Not Candidate’

Dean J. Dickson Phillips of
the UNC Law School said he
is ‘not a candidate for presi-
dent of the college in a DA.
VIDSONIAN interview this
week.

The 1943 Davidson graduate
and former law partner of
‘ex-Governor Terry Sanford
said he has not been ap-
proached by any agent of
the college regarding the
presidency which Dr. D.
Grier Martin will vacate on

BATES, COCHRAN

Campus rumor had Phillips
as a candidate supported un-
officially by alumni groups,
but he said he has been ap-
proached by no such groups
in regard to his possible can
didacy.

confidence.”

— “Public comments and
reports from these commit-
tees can give rise to publicity
and speculation about speci-
fic individuals who are. pros-
pects."

— "The best prospects for
the presidency will probably
have to be sought after by us
rather than seeking the posi
tion themselves."

-— “Publicity and, specula- -

tion about a prospect can be
detrimental to a prospect's ~
standing in the academic
world if he is made to appear
a leading candidate for the
presidency and then is not:
invited to’ be.”

Lingle said that if any
group should form an oppos-
ing faction to a presidential
candidate that such a man
would probably be reluctant
to accept the job if it were
offered.

Some opposition of this type
appeared last week in a
satiric list of presidential qua-
lifications, written anony-
mously, and sent to members
of the faculty.

“Publicity can put a pros-

pect in the position of appear-
ing to seek the Davidson
presidency, and this could be
detrimental to our chances of
obtaining the best man,"
Lingle said.
. Lingle had asked members
of all three presidential!
selection committees not to
comment when asked public.
ly about committees’ activi-
ties.

At the close of his letter.
Lingle said, ‘I am a firm be-
liever in freedom of speech
and freedom of the press .. ,
If our committees seem to
be closemouthed about our
activities .. . I hope that you
will) understand and respect
our policy.”

2 Named Wilson Fellows

GUS COCHRAN
-. « UFC president

Twq seniors have been
named Woodrow Wilson Fel-
lows for 1968-69, one of the
highest academic honors a
prospective graduate student
can receive.

They are Mike Bates of
Norfolk, Va., and Gus Coch-
ran of Athens, Ga.

This year the Woodrow Wil-
son National Fellowship
Foundation reports that it is
seeking the “best future col-
lege teacher prospects on ihe
continent’’ through its selec-
tion processes.

In previous years the foun.
dation has supported the first
year of graduate study of
Woodrow Wilson Fellows.
Now it is seeking primarily
to select top students, leav-
ing most of the financial sup-

port to the graduate schools
which the fellows may at-
tend.

Bates is chairman of the
YMCA’‘s Stimulus program,
chairman of the student body
Constitution Revision Com-
mittee, and a member of
Omicron Delta Kappa. He is
a philosophy major.

Cochran is president of the
Interfraternity Council and
a member of Omicron Delta
Kappa, Phi Beta Kappa and
Kappa Alpha. He is a politi-
cal science major.

Out of 11,000 applicants.
1,000 college students were
designated as fellows.

Eighteen Davidson students
were recommended by facul-
ty members for the awards
last fall.
