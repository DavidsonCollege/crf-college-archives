My
Answer -

By Rush Otey
Dean of Students

I have heard through the campus grapevine that you’re doing”'

some funny things with water these days. But I’m not interested.in
that. What I really want to know, Rush, is whether you’re planning
to move in next door to Diane Stone next year. Come on, give, Rush.
Are you going to be our next dean?

Many students have asked me why I have accepted the postion as
Dean of Students next year.

Although I realize this must be puzzling to some of you, especially
you, Will, it really was not at all a hasty action.

Although God just let me in on it yesterday, he informed me that
he has been predestining this for quite some time.

He led me out of seminary to come up through the farm system
here for deans, I understand Will is going to be offered a new
position.

I have no idea what position that will be, but I understand Dean
Burts is considering spending a lot of time with his. two new gran-
dsons as a matter of course. There may be an opening somewhere
around drop/add time.

I’m tired of being couped up in the church playing second guitar
to John Rogers, anyway. I’m really looking forward to something
that’s a bit more secular.

My new office is a bit small, but I think I can make it com-
fortable. I still haven’t figured out where I’m going to put my pulpit
though.

To the Editor:

During World War LI I.knew a
Volkswagen repairman who, no
matter what the subject was,
would inevitably end up talking
about Gott and heroes. It
seemed he knew Him and His
political party.

One day the battery com-
mander told him to talk about
comraderie on the Toyota
assembly line. He knew about
economy in speaking as well as
economy small cars.

His lecture only took a few
minutes, and the major portion
of his presentation was spoken
in tongues, with half wit and
audacity, a medicum of poor
taste, and even a moderate
sprinkling of name dropping.

Most of the people weren't
taken in by his gibberish
preferring to believe in the
divine spark plug within us all
rather than in the champion
Nazi plug.

~ Those were the days when a
man in Germany had to be a
linguist and preferably free of
semetic compassion if he wan-
ted to be regarded as a
superhuman intellectual of the
past.

Claxton, Kennedy In ’76_

I responded to a call from the Editor- °

in-chief. I found him sleeping in a file
cabinet, third drawer from the bottom.

“You sent for me, Chief?’’

“Yeah, Everside. We are planning a
big issue and want a political interview.
They say that Stoop Claxton the Senator
from the District of Columbia will talk to
anyone. I’m thinking of sending you.
Can you handle it?

“Chief, I’ve handled them all.’’

‘Listen, Everside, you’ve been with
the paper longer than anyone. I’ve
heard of five-year men, but you’re
ridiculous. How do you stay in?”’

“‘Well, Dr. Spencer and I were pen-
pals at Sandhurst.”

“I didn’t know Dr. Spencer went to
Sandhurst.’’

‘‘We Sandies don’t like to brag. Siro
appreciate the assignment:”’
~ Then he pulled a Jungs Chinese Laun-

_dry slip from his pocket and ripped off
the part that said ‘‘press’’.

‘‘Here, put this in your hat brim. Go get
them fella.” i

He put a paternal hand on my nose and
pushed me backwards through the door.
I picked myself up, ran down the stairs,
jumped on my Schwinn and was at the
Hub in 10 seconds. I had Ralph give mea
Greyhound ticket for Washington. ,

Once on the Greyhound the thrill of the
story was on me. This was probably the
biggest since Will Terry was christened.
Of course there were the old days, riding
on the running boards of an ambulance.
Boy, the first couple of months after
they stopped putting running boards on
ambulances was rough on my shins.

But that’s life without a change? Now
I was going to meet a biggie, Senator
Stoop Claxton.

Senator Stoop Claxton stood in his of-
fice. The scene was impressive even to
this seasoned reporter. ~

On one wall, there was a 30 foot
mural of the Boeing Aircraft Plant. On
another wall was a list of questions from
General Curtis LeMay.

In the center of the room was a 90 foot
tall bomb. On its side was. written:

- “Ruskies adopt a humanitarian attitude
toward Jews or else.”’

The Senator spoke first. ‘‘Ah, yes,
you’re the reporter from The David-

sonian. sia able staff has Syn me data

on your paper, most impressive.

‘‘When may I expect an endorsement
for my unannounced candidacy?’’

“Well, that depends on how you an-
swer some of the questions I have for
you. Are you ready?”’
> es Snooln

“Senator, Some people believe we
have as much right to dictate Russian
treatment of Jews as they do our treat-
ment of Indians. How do you feel about
that?”’

‘Well, The American people are
dedicated to seeing all human beings
fairly treated.” ~

““Yes?..is that all you have tosay?”’

“You can quote me. Anything else?’’

“Senator, since you have blitzed
detente perhaps it would be better to
choose another area of discussion. Tell
me, why did you vote on the Health Bill
to limit the amounts of all vitamins sold
without prescription except Vitamin B-
172?

“The American people need B-1. It
will be the backbone of our defense. It
will employ half the nation’s work force
just to build one. That’s important in
these times of drastic economic dif-
ficulty.”’

‘Senator,

you have said ‘George
Wallace, Rabbi Korff, Norman Vincent

Peale, Ted) Kennedy, Mamie
Eisenhower, and Alice Cooper would all
be worth your consideration as a Vice
Presidential running mate. Some people
think you are using this as a device to
round up support for your candidacy. Is
this true?”’

“Nothing of the sort. Say, have you
ever thought of your name becoming a
household word?”’

-uh, well,
Senator.”
“Thanks for coming. Appreciate the

endorsement.”’
That was that. I made a few other

visits around the Capitol picking
valuable information and went back to
the intellectual center of North Cor-
nelius.

Iraced up to the office, pulled open the
file drawer and shouted, ‘I’ve got it, »
Chief, the scoop of the year. Besides that
I’ve uncovered that Jack Bevan is a CIA
plant and that his real name is Toshiro

thanks anyway,

Mifune.” baa

-cannot _ hold.

LETTERG

As we know, that was four
score amnesties and seven
moratoriums .ago. Toddy Ger-
many is desolate because all
those people have flocked to
small liberal arts colleges to
teach their native language.

The new generation is a little
younger, a little wiser.

Different as these genera-
tions might be at first
glance, you can get a lot of
mileage out of trite com-
parisons. At any rate, the major
thing they have in common is
that they believe they have all
the answers in their small
economy minds to the questions
they find along the road of life.

Thus it does not surprise me
that doctor noster imposter
Wruck has a solution for the
fear and loathing in the David-
son disintegration society.

And nobody except Germans
could be’so shortsighted (not to
mention people at the other
three corners of this flat earth
who’ve never heard of the luf-
twaffe or seen a swastica).

No, Dr. Wruck, if you want
to show little folk the yellow
brick road, mention the Good
Book, and that is not ‘‘Mein
Kampf.”

Goot ridance, non lughead
wrench yur neck detestari, e.p.
thorn in my side, sad inteli geri.

To the Editor: :
I was truly embareassed to be
caught with my pants down by

the Quips & Cranks’ photo-
grapher.

I have been filled with regrets

and deep-seated emotions, but I
hope you will excuse one whose
hindsight has always been bet-
ter than his foresight.

As everyone can see, I have
come clean and the bullshit has

stopped.

Alec Hoon ’74

This letter is written in
response to the last three years
of the Davidsonian. The pic-
tures are terrible. Don’t any of
you idiots have any sense of
art? Thursday upon Thursday I
have been deluged with enough
of the stuff to cause violent in-
digestion.

Those basketball pictures ,
for instance: why don’t the
players ever smile? I’m sure
that if your photographer tried
he could get them to cooperate.
Perhaps it would help if he met
them before the game with a
tube of Crest. ie

Thinking of basketball brings

something else to mind. None
of you people realize that some
pictures just don’t make it as
you crop them. As an example,
you clowns would probably
make a pic of the Empire State
Building a horizontal.

On a different plain, I bet you
would even run a picture of a
bulldozer in the middle of a foot-
ball field as a vertical.

In conclusion, maybe the
whole thing isebeyond hope.
Your best bet might be to get rid
of those lousy . photographers,
especially the guy who doesn’t
know better than to take
horizontal basketball pictures.

Lapsidies In Blue

Once upon a midnight dreary
while I pondered weak and
weary I sought a theme and
sought for it in vain. Shall I
compare thee to a summer’s
day out of the hills of Haber-
sham?

The fog comes on little cat
feet. It is an Ancient Mariner.
Midway along the journey of
our life on the shore of the wide
world I stand alone and think.

The sea is calm _ to-night.
Flood tide below me I see you
face to face. I shall wear the
bottom of my trousers rolled.

(Some say the earth will end

with us.)

diverged in a yellow wood.
Whose woods these are I think I
know.

Little Lamb, who made thee?

Let us go then you and I. I
measure time by how a body
sways. I placed a jar in Ten-
nessee. I am a little world made
cunningly.

Candy is dandy, but liquor is -

quicker. I taste a liquor never
brewed. Brought death into the

world and all our woe. Hence
vain deluding joys.
