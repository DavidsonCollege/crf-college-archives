Here’s a fun fact: American consumers
throw away enough aluminum to rebuild our
entire commercial air fleet every three
months? That’s
over 68 billion
pounds!

It only took one
observant and re-
sourceful Gray
Patterson, Sopho-
mofye class presi-
dent, to build off
of the already ex-
isting (but limited)
recycling program
at Davidson and
make Patterson
Court environ-
mentally friendly.
“T just saw it as a
way for SGA to
step in and really
make a difference
in the environ-
ment.”

In the past, re-
cycling bins were
only in Chambers
and the residence
halls. PCC and SGA has now directed more
resources towards the court. °

Recycling came to Davidson through the
combined efforts of Whitney Frasier, ’00,
and the Environmental Action Committee.
Together they worked to raise environmental
awareness on campus by placing recycling
bins in rooms in Chambers as well as in the
bathrooms of residence halls. °

This year, concerned members of the SGA
formed a committee to oversee recycling
endeavors at Davidson. Chaired by Patterson,
the committee also seats Sophomore class

tive Sam DuPont, Rusk representative Abby

prove coordination between the Dean Rusk
Program, the Office of Study Abroad and the
International Studies advisor. He worked with
President Vagt and the Advisory Council to
move the programs from three separate build-
ings to their current co-location in the base-
ment of Chambers. Brown also facilitated the
creation of Davidson’s chapter of Phi Beta
Delta, the honor society for students of inter-
national studies.

Brown sees the work of the Dean Rusk
Program as crucial since Davidson students
will inevitably be involved in a global com-
munity. “Increasing what students know about
the world is important since
interconnectedness is growing. Graduates will
be involved in international issues, whether
as professionals or as citizens. They must
understand what’s going on elsewhere,” he
said.

Although Brown will be moving on, he
looks forward to the Dean Rusk Program’s
continued success. He would like to see in-
creased funds and travel grants available. He
hopes that the programs will eventually be
able to move into-even more appropriate
quarters, like an international house, together.
“The international program at Davidson will
prosper. We’ ve seen such an increase in stu-

dent participation and support from the ad-
ministration, alumnae, friends of the College
and the community,” he commented.

Brown is anticipating the challenges of
his new position at the Association for Diplo-
matic Studies and Training, which is a non-
governmental organization devoted to ad-
vancing awareness about American diplo-
macy. The organization sponsors conferences,
exhibits, and offers support for training of
foreign service officers.

Along with his enthusiasm for this op-
portunity comes mixed feelings about leav-
ing Davidson. “I will miss the involvement
with the students,” he said. “It will also be
hard to leave such pleasant surroundings.”

the Vamanos Van. “We have aperfectly good
Vamanos Van and a Lake Campus that barely
gets used. Maybe more people would use it if
they had a free’ ride there,” he said. Finally,
Pittenger will commit to a specific hour a
week when he would make himself available
for students to discuss issues and concerns

with him.

“We will have the most productive SGA
that Davidson has ever seen and the students
will know what’s going on,” he promised..,
