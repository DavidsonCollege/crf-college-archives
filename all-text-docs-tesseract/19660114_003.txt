*Catfish Founder
In USC’s Wake

University of South Carolina’s Gamecock swimmers
grabbed top honors in nine of 11 events to crush their
Davidson hosts, 62-33, here Tuesday.

Davidson sophomore Bris Rod-
gers won the 50-yard free style
in 23.6 seconds for the ‘Cats’
only first place in an individual
event.

The ‘Cats also copped the 400-
yard free style relay with a time
of 3:43.6 minutes. Swimming the
event for Davidson were John
Helm, Pau! Monk, Jim Stokes,
and Rodgers.

The Gamecocks took the 400-
yard medley relay in 4:05.9 to
gcab the opening lead. Carolina's
Jim Kincaid then outdistanced
Helm in the 200-yard free stvle
to widen the Gamecock lead.

Gamecocks Bili Muller -and
Mike Lewis swept the top spots
in the 200-yard individual med-
ley, while Carolinians Chick
Lannehs (diving), John Pitten-
ton (200-yard butterfly.) and
Dick Machata (100-yard free
style) won their events to put
the meet on ice.

South Carolina left the meet
with a 2-1 record, falling to UNC
while registering wins over Dav-
idson and feeble Duke.

The ‘Cats now stand 2-2 for,
the season. Friday they host;

a team from Emory here at
3:30 p.m, The visitors will be
out to counter the shellacking
they took last week at the hands
of Vanderbilt.

The ball ripped the cords with a swish. Manager
Jim Hyder had just sunk a 40-footer at the buzzer.

As West Virginia Coach Bucky Waters put it,
“] knew when he cocked his arm it was going in.
Wier just that kind of a night.” Davidson had won
105-79.

That shot made little difference in Coach Lefty
Driesell’s 100th college victory. But frustration was
such for West Virginia fans that one West Virginia
radio announcer remarked upon Hyder's first at-
tempt, “We were all pulling for him.”

Phil Squier started the rout with a jumper at
19:05, followed by Tom Youngdale’s jumper, another
‘by Squier, and four quick points by Rodney Knowles.
Carl Head’s free throw at 16:33 put the Mounties on
the scoreboard. An excellent Wildcat defense kept
them from connecting on a field goal until 15:25, as
the offense built up a 14-4 lead at that point

gEdge Surprising Citadel Squad, 81-77

Dick Snyder contributed another outstanding
performance, scoring 35. points. Youngdale played
is finest game of the season with 21 points and a lot
of hustle. Squier scored all of his 12 points in the
first half and proved the sparkplug. Bobby Lane
contributed excellent defense and performed well,
although he missed his first foul shots of the season
after 36 straight.

Tuesday’s game was another story. The Citadel,
losers of seven in a row, came to Johnston Gym-
nasium unimpressed with the 'Cats handling of West
Virginia and kept the game in doubt throughout,
losing only 81-77. Dick Snyder’s 38 points, 20 in the
second half, spelled the difference. Knowles added

Although hitting on 59.6 per cent of their shots,
the Wildcats disappointed Coach Driesell, who said,
“We just didn’t take the shots we could have.”
Bothered mostly by a pair of hot-hitting guards,
Wig Bauman and John DeBrosse, the ’Cats never led
by more than ten points..

Squier Fills Unsung Hero’s Role

By CLIFF DUKE
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Scan the preseason bas-
ketball magazines, read
the scouting reports on each
team, and you discover a
few basic “facts” about this
Davidson team's prospects.
Dick Snyder was to assume
court leadership of the
Wildcats, two tall sopho-
mores—Rod Knowles and
Tom Youngdale — would
supply the needed rebound-
ing and Bobby Lane would
prove to be outstanding.

The unsung hero's role is left
then to Phil Squier. This you
could not have known prior to
the first toss-up of the season.
either.

While the experts discussed
other names as the Wildcats’
fifth man, Squier . steadily as-
cended to the role. And despite
having. virtually no more ex-
perience than the team’s herald-
ed sophomores, his improving
performances have made him a
major asset to Davidson's suc-
cess,

The slightly built Squier, a
product of Newton, N. J.. sifled
through about 12 scholarship of-
fers before coming to terins
with Davidson. He summed up
his reasons by saying, “I vis-
jted down here during my senior
year in high school, and liked
it very well. I was especially

* impressed by the student body.”
' So he matriculated here, and
‘ went on to start on the Fred

Hetzel-led freshman team.

Squier dropped out of bas-
ketball, and out of school for a
semester, due to illness, but he
returned to the hardcourt last
year as a junior. However, he
accrued little experience in scor-
ing 1.5 points a game.

Squier admits to this. “Last
year I played very little, and
this year is my first playing on
the point. Naturally, I feel very
much like a sophomore.”

Nevertheless, his floor play
has steadied the young Wildcats
and sparked them to a 12-2
mark, with one game remain-

Grapplers Face
Emory Matmen

Davidson’s Wildcat grapplers meet Emory Uni-
versity here on the home mats at 7 p.m. today.

Last year Davidson almost shut out the team
from Decatur, Ga., but this year Emory is expected
to be stronger competition.

For Coach Charlie Parker’s matmen, Johnny
Webb, a Davidson senior, has returned from a year

abroad and is expected to help in the 137
class. Joe Buffington, 123 pounder, and

und
well

Bryan, heavyweight, will be trying to preserve their

undefeated seasons.
The meet Friday

until after the semester

is a varsity affair only. After
Emory the next meet is not

’Cats meet such wrestling powers as N. C. State and

Duke.

A win Friday would break a two meet losing
streak for Davidson and send them into the exam

ing prior to exams.

On the court Squier has de-
veloped into a steady dribbler
and assist-maker. He has good
hands and speed. but would like
to improve his defense and
shooting although his occasional
outside shots have helped loosen
the opponent's defense.

He has not shot often—he
averages 7 shots a game—but
has hit for an eight point aver-
age. This includes a season’s
high of 17 points which he tallied
against Furman, wry ee

In discussing the season,
Squier made these comments.
“We have been up and down,
but it is hard to get “high” for
a game once in a while. We are
gaining the confidence needed
to carry us through, though. This
team is constantly improving.
making less mistakes, and gain-
ing confidence.

“Of course, Snyder is our only
individual star, but everyone is
learning to play better together.

I think this group has better
teamwork than past Davidson
teams. This we demonstrated
best against West Virginia and
Ohio University.

“I knew we could have’ a
good season, but now we might

just go on to win the tourna- . |

And if this is the first Driesell oi
‘team to do so, its success can
largely be attributed to Phil
Squier's development as _ the
“unknown” starter.

NOTES...

Sinee Furman beat South Carolina (about the
same degree of an upset as Wake Forest beating
Davidson), it becomes rather obvious that the South-
ern Conference is again capable of taking on and
upsetting rivals in the stronger, richer Atlantic
Coast Conference.

Furman’s win might also shed some light on the

rather stale showing the ’Cats had against The
Citadel the night before the Furman-USC game.
- South Carolina beat the nation’s number one
team, the Duke Blue Devils, by two points; Furman
beat South Carolina by seven, and Davidson beat
Furman by 20.

Obviously when you‘re 29 points better than
the number one team in the nation, you’re not going
to get too excited about playing a team that has lost
seven straight. .

=

Unquestionably Davidson’s 105 97 victory over
West Virginia rates as one of the finest perform-
ances ever bv a Davidson basketball team. Among
other things it:

Was the most points scored by the Wildcats in
any game so far this year (98 against Richmond
is second). .

Was the largest margin by which we have ever
beaten a West Virginia team (103-80 last year was
the largest margin of victory).

Was Coach Lefty Driesell’s 100th win in six sea-
sons at Davidson. Only one other man has done this,
from 1937-49 Coach N. Shepard won 170 games.

Again put Davidson in a class all by itself in
the Southern Conference.

Should convince most skeptics that Davidson’s
1865-66 version of Wildcats are a power to be con-
sidered for national ranking, despite their youthful-
ness,

* ¢

Dick Snyder's 29.8 seering average is high
enough to be a new Davidson record, if he can hold
it the rest of the season. Last year Fred Hetzel set
the mark with a 27.3 average.

* s e

i€ Bobby Lane can continue his 90.9 free throw
percentage another, older Davidson record would
fall by the wayside. In 1957-58 Semi Mintz hit 88.2
per cent of his shots from the foul line. His per-
centage is the second best average in NCAA his-

tory.
