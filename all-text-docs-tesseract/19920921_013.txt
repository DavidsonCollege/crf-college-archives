Financial Aid Offers.
Scholarship Search Program

By Sean Lind

The Financial Aid Office now
offers a scholarship search pro-
gram. The new “Student Aid Re-
search Through Technology”, or
START program is designed to
simplify the difficult, often frus-
trating hunt for financial aid.

The database, which is_up-
dated every three months, contains
information on over 300,000 schol-
arships.

Students use the program by
filling outa standardized form. The
form requests personal informa-

tion, GPA, race, handicaps, career
objectives, etc. This “personal pro-
file” is then used to pair students
with prospective scholarships.

Once the possible scholarship
opportunities are found, START
will provide students with ad-
dresses where they can write for
scholarship applications. START
will also specify any special re-
quirements that these scholarships
might have.

Most students qualify for at
least five or six scholarships.

Students Participate in
Mexican Study Abroad Program

By Carey Stewart and Robert
Lloyd-Still

Over the summer, Dr.
Hemandez and nineteen Davidson
students journeyed to Guadalajara,
Mexico to study, travel, speak
spanish, and soak up the culture of
our neighboring country. Since
most of us were not quite fluent in
spanish, we were.a little nervous
about living ina city of five million
people where people very seldom
speak english.

After a few days, that ner-
vousness disappeared as each of us
moved in with our new families.
Of course, our spanish improved
dramatically the more we inter-
acted with people and settled in to
everyday life in Mexico. Although
it took a while to figure out the
public transportation system, it was
worth it. Guadalajara’s excellent
bus system goes almost anywhere
in the city for about fifteen cents
(500 pesos). Other popular forms
of transportation include mopeds,
taxis, and VW Beetles. —

All class instruction was in
spanish, While Dr. Hernandez
taught intensive spanish, other in-
structors lectured on the politics,
economics, arts, and the history of
Mexico. Class lectures were fol-
lowed up by afternoon excursions
to art museums, local markets, or
towering cathedrals.

Fortunately, we had several
epportunities to examine the noc-

turnal activities around
Guadalajara. The bar scene con-
sisted mainly of multi-leveled
“discotecs” where the bouncers
hand-picked the most attractive
people out of the hugecrowds to be
allowed in. We were luckily al-
lowed in also. —

The streets were filled with
vendors selling incredibly good
food. We were forewarned not to
eat it, but for some of us the aroma
was just too tempting. Those who
gave in were greeted with an ex-
tended visit from the infamous
Montezuma and his dreaded re-
venge.

Most of the people in
Guadalajara were very friendly to
us and usually very curious. Many
people liked to talk about politics,
the free trade agreement, and Ross
Perot, while others wanted to ar-
gue about basketball.

One night, some high school
students spotted several of us and
challenged us to a game of basket-
ball against their high school. We
passively accepted and soon found
ourselves in a game with referees,
cheerleaders, and lots of enthusi-
astic fans. Since most of us that

played that day are ex-church

leaguers, our performance was
painfully average. We lost by
twenty and the crowd seemed let-
down, as though they had been
expecting the Dream Team. No
one bothered challenging usagain.

free of charge. Comparable mail-
order programs can cost between
$45 and $90.

The program will be made
available not only to current stu-
dents, but to prospectives as well.

Gordon Peck, Dean of Finan-
cial Aid, said the new program is
not-a replacement for current fi-
nancial aid services.. Rather,
START will “supplement what
we’re giving [students] at Davidson
or help those who aren’t eligible

_ for financial aid here.”

Most of our weekends were
spent in other parts of Mexico. We
visited the shores of the pictur-
esque Lake Chapala, which is natu-
rally contained by the eminent
mountains that seem torise straight
out the water. We also spent a few
days at the Pacific coast on the
beaches of Melaque. and
Manzanilla, which was nice. We
travelled extensively through the
state of Michoacan to towns such
as Guanajanto, Morelia, and Taxco.

The last week of the program
was spent in Mexico City, the big-
gest city in the world. Although
the city has become legendary for
its pollution, it was not noticeably
different from any other big city.
The subway system was clean and
went everywhere. We spent all of
our time travelling around the city,
but it would take months to see it
all.

The Davidson in Mexico ex-
perience was excellent in all as-
pects. It provided a well balanced
mix of education and travel, while
at the same time allowing plenty of
time for “everyday” experiences.

The bottom line is that we all °

learned a lot and had a good time
while doing so. Those who have
an interest in going to Mexiconext
summer should drop by the Span-
ish Department for information. It
will be time well spent.

The Big Brother/Little
Brother service program has been
growing strong since it was started
four years ago. This program’s
main goal is to build friendships
with and create role models for
kids in the community. In doing
so, the self satisfaction gained by
the big brother is surpassed only
by the happiness of the kids,

Alcohol Enforcement

Committee Decides

By Sarah Gayle

The Alcohol Enforcement
Committee met on Wednesday
September 16, 1992 for the first
time. The purpose of the meeting
and of the meetings to come is to 1)
make some profunctory guidelines
to lead decisions in the future and
2) to deal with the alcohol viola-
tions already given out.

The Committee is “composed
of five members; an administrator
(the Dean of Students or his desig-
nate) who should ordinarily serve
as chair, a faculty.member from a
pool of five faculty appointed by
the President, and three students
from a pool of eighteen students
appointed by the PCC (12) and
SGA (6 unaffiliated members”
(Article VII (A) of the Alcohol
Policy).

At this time,. the most com-
plete list of members of the pool of
faculty and students is as follows:

Faculty: Peter Ahrensdorf,
Alex Pinkston, Pamela Hay, and
Wanda Webb

PCC appointed students: Greg
Padreick, Dave Tonnidandel, Pe-
ter Fischer, Sarah Gayle, Sarah

_ Patterson

SGA appointed students: John
Ogle, Josh Neubauer, Greg Fisher,
Meredith Hammonds, Jennifer
Williams, and Ben Wiley.

Wednesday 25 individual vio-
lations (NOT 150!) were sanc-
tioned. (Thisis the total number of
violations since the start of this
school year.) The majority of these
consisted of students under the age
of 21 posessing an alcholic bever-
age. Based on the North Carolina
State Law, the Committee decided
that the first of this type of uncom-
plicated violation would result in a
$25 fine.

The second possession viola-
tion results in a minimum fine of.

Minimum Sanctions

$50. For the third similar violation
a student will receive a larger fine,
assessment of necessity of coun-
seling, and possibly community
service.

Above are the sanctions for
simply possessing alcohol when
under 21. These sanctions will be
reviewed for any cases that are
more complex, i.e. those involving
intoxication, destruction of prop-
erty, etc. The fines collected from
the students or houses who vio- —
lated the policy will be put into the
“account” from which monitors
and policemen are paid. _

Atthe meeting on Wednesday
five houses also received sanctions
because of three events. The com-
mittee attempted to base the sanc-
tions for these houses on similar
cases that were dealt with in previ-
ous years. The mostcommon house
sanctions include but are not lim-
ited to warnings, fines and social
probation.

The AEC meetings will be
every Wednesday with rotating
committce members. Students who
have received a violation will get a
letter informing them of the loca-
tion and time of the meeting. He or
she is reminded of the violation
and told he/she may come to the
meeting to “defend” him/her self.

The AEC would most like to
curb the abuse of alcohol. by, stu-
dents-at Davidson. Many of the
guidelines of the new Alcohol
Policy are based on North Caro-
lina state laws. If you don't not
know the regulations of the new
policy, the AEC recommends you
pick acopy of it up at the Dean of
Students’ Office because IGNO-
RANCE IS NOT AN EXCUSE!
Monthly reports of the committee’s
decisions/ actions will be printed
in The Davidsonian .

By Matt Bumstead

As I begin to discuss the sys-
tem, I want to lead off with some
general points to remember:

If you suspect a violation
or think you have seen one, what
should you do? - - First, go to the
person whose actions are in ques-
tion and talk to him. If, having
spoken with him, you still be-
lieve a violation has been com-
mitted, ask him to turn himself in
t tothe Dean’s office; ifhe refuses,
you must take the next step.

DONOT talk toa friend first
and do not turn the case in to'a
member of the Council. You
should approach either the Dean
of Students office or the Student
Solicitors (Deidra Montague and
Tom Price). If you tell a member
of the Council information about
apossible case, that Council mem-
ber is disqualified as a potential
panel member for that case.

Remember that all trials
are open to the public until de- °
clared closed by the defendant.
-- Inclosing a trial, the defendant
ensures that all those involved in

' tings will not di

‘a closed trial. Please don’t think

them with anyone not involved in
them. The defendant, too, is bound
by this agreement to confidential-
ity, which is maintained in order to
protect the defendant and all those
involved.

__ Therefore, please realize that
the reason that the student body
knows so little (or none) about
what goes on in a particular trial is
not that the Council just wants to
be secretive but that the defendant
has requested such secrecy. Panel
members are bound not to discuss

that a Council member who says,
“T can’t talk about it” is trying to
hold something over you or to be
superior. She is doing just what
you do when you say you cannot
talk about atest or a self-scheduled
exam (and your parents getangry);
breaking the agreement of confi-
dentiality is a violation of the Honor
Code! She can’t discuss it - for the
defendant’s sake and for her own.

So, how does all this work?
Dean Terry will examine the case
