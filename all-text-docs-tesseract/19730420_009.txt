Berry had six first places and
three seconds in the 17 events
which were held. A total of eight
track records were set in the
meet.

The records came in the six-
mile run, 100 yard dash, 120
high hurdles, high jump,
long jump, 440 yard relay, triple
jump, and two-mile relay.

Head Track Coach Sterling
Martin was pleased with David-
son's eighth place finish. ‘The
team as a whole ran fairly
well,’ commented Martin, ad-
ding that, ‘‘We didn't expect to
score more points than last year
so we really weren't too disap-
pointed at all.

“Overall it was a pretty good
meet.” said Martin. “It) was
created for the small schools
with unsubsidized teams— in
mind, but with the exception of
Davidson there just isn’t any
such animal around anymore.”’

Martin singled out) several
performances by the team in
the relays

“Steve Shankweiler threw the
shot pretty well in taking third
place, noted Martin

The other weight man singled
out by Martin was Dave Crum-
pler, who took second place in
the discus

“Dave did a good job and was
throwing well.” said) Martin.
“He might have taken first, but
he has been bothered by a badly
pulle d back lately

in the pole vault; perhaps he
could've gone a little higher but
it was still a good effort. Both
Woody and I were pleased,”
said Martin.

Martin saved his highest
praise however, for Ricky Bell
and Greg Love.

“Ricky turned in a 1:58 half
mile for us in the distance
medley, the fastest time we've
had this year,” said Martin.

‘Greg Love took second place
in the 120 high hurdles and ran
very well,”’ Martin said.

“If Greg continues to im-
prove, then I think he'll have a
good shot at placing in the con-
ference meet," added Martin.

Martin did note that he was
disappointed with several of the
performanced turned in by the
Cats.

“Our 440 relay team disap-
pointed me a little bit, but Mark
Conners, who runs anchor, had
a pretty bad muscle pull,”’ said
Martin.

“Eppa Rixey did well in the
high jump. but he ran into some
pretty heavy traffic and didn't
place.’ explained Martin.

Martin again pointed out that
he was pleased with the team's
performance in the meet.

“We really didn't expect to do
as well as last year expecially
because of the competition
which was about as good as
you'll find in the area,”’ said
Martin.

On Monday the track team
was edged out, 74-71, by Wake

i tine

Forrest in what Martin felt was
the team's best performance of
the year.

“After we saw Wake in the
relays we didn't feel that we
could stay with them in a dual
meet,”’ he said.

The meet came down to the
last event, the mile relay, with
Davidson leading 71-69. Wake
Forrest won the race and the
five points were enough to give
them the victory.

‘It was our best mile relay of
the year and if Mark Conners
hadn't been hurt, I think we
could've won,’ Martin com-
menied. .

“As it was, we only lost by 10
yards or so,"’ he added.

Ricky Bell was the Cat's out-
standing performer in the meet
with a double win in the mile
and three mile. Both times were
the team’s fastest this year.
Bell won the mile in a time of
4:28 which pleased Martin
greatly.

Steve Peaco set a_ school
record finishing second in the
440 intermediate hurdles.

The team's performance
gave Martin cause for optimism
concerning this Saturday's dual
meet with a strong Citadel
team.

“After the way they came out,

and ran against Wake Forrest, |
think the team has a good
chance of beating The Citadel.
At any rate, I know we'll be
right with them all the way,”
he noted.

place out of a field of eight
schools that participated in the
South Atlantic Sailing
Association | Championships,

held at Clemson last weekend.

Although Clemson had been
favored to win, it was The
Citadel that captured the num-
ber one position.

“It was unusual that The
Citadel won at Clemson. Clem-
son looked stronger earlier in
the season and the previous
regattas.” Davidson Com-
modore Daryl Douglas com-
mented.

All the races were. sailed
Saturday in light to moderate

was light and variable.

“For example. the last race
Started at 5:15. then the wind
died down and it wasn't until
7:30 that the race was over.
They literally sat in the boats
and drifted.’ Douglas com-
mented
