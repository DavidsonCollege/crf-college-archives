Peace in the Heart—Archibald Rutledge.
Doubleday, Doran and Co, 1932.

In the beauty and wonder of the dawn, in
the solitude of the deep woods, in the magic
of moonlight on the river, one man has
found peace and contentment, and in this
book has written of them in an informal
and entertaining way. Probably none of our
southern writers is better qualified to write
a book of this nature. Although he is now
a professor of English literature at Mer-
cersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, Archi-
bald Rutledge writes of the life he knows
best—the life on the large southern planta-
tion which is his real home.

’

Born at “Hampton,” an old rice planta-
tion on the banks of the Santee River, Rut-
life about him. With a trusted negro boy
for his companion, he roamed up and down
the broad river which flowed by his door,
or plunged into the forest which almost sur-

the boy soon became a student and a lover
of wild life. Even now every vacation finds
him again at “Hampton,” stalking a deer
without a gun or paddling down the beloved
river, weird in the light of the stars.

Rutledge has roamed those great forests
until he is almost on speaking terms with
the wild creatures which abound there. He
knows—how—the—deer_spend the night in
roaming through their feeding grounds, and
how they sleep all day in some favorite
spot. For he has watched, and instead of
shooting, has learned and appreciated. He
has found the otter, that elusive phantom
of the water, sporting on the banks of an
isolated lagoon. He has observed the wild
creatures as they live their individual lives,
now frightened by the flood or the storm,
now rushing pell-mell before the hounds,
but always returning when the danger has
passed to the calmness and serenity of life
free from civilization. Rutledge has seen
in the lives of these animals a joy and a

Davidson Five and
Ten Years Ago

FIVE YEARS AGO

In their first practice game last week, the
baseball team started the year off right by
defeating the Duke Power Company 8 to 3.

The following men were bid by Phi Beta
Kappa last week and will be initiated. on
May 25: C. F. McCrue, W. B. Bradford, J.
M. Akers,-and- J. P> McKnight:

Converse Glee Club made its annual ap-
pearance at Davidson on last Saturday night
under the auspices of the Junior class, ren-
dering a varied program to an audience that
almost filled Shearer. The club is always

Qn Wednesday, April 4, staff officers from
the War Department will arrive at David-

inspection. The officers will make a,.thor-
ough inspection of the R. O. T. C. unit here
and Davidson’s remaining an honor military
unit depends upon their report.

TEN YEARS AGO

The petition of the Senior class to be al-
lowed to attend church services under the
honor system was declined after being care-
fully considered by the executive committee.

.The Y. M. C, A. has succeeded in obtain-
ing the services of Mr. David Ovens, man-
ager of one of Charlotte’s largest depart-
ment stores, to speak for vespers next Sun-
day evening.

In keeping with the progress of college
dramatics, the Davidson Dramatic Club is
planning to issue a year book that will com-
pare favorably with similar publications by
other North Carolina dramatic associations:

controlled freedom which comes when we
obey the laws of nature.

But this is not a book on Natural History,
nor an Animal Psychology, for in the out-
of-doors Rutledge has found an even more
wonderful secret. Behind it all he sees a
God, who has made all and who watches all,
and with this discovery has come “Peace
in the Heart.” A joy of living, a calmness
of spirit, a worship of Him—these are the
jewels to be found in nature for the one
who searches. “Seeing the sudden beauty
of a marsh wren, walking through the tat-
tered and ominous splendor of a cyclone,
watching a grim bull alligator riding the
breakers, he has found it simple to believe

-jin their creator. He is no preacher, but he

does tell how he found in nature the magic
of contentment.”
—W. B. WARD.

Vor Sonnenuntergang, Schauspiel by Ger-
hart Hauptmann, Berlin, S. Fischer Ver-
lag, 1932.

From two standpoints the title of this

.|play is eminently suited. For it is first of

all the story of a man who, just “before the
setting. of his sun,” attempts tragically to
bring a new love into his life; and secondly
it is a play written by a man who is him-
self in the years shortly before the setting
of his sun.

Often, as men grow older, their mental
powers deteriorate; and so it is not infre-
quent that one sees the pitiable case of a
famous author, once an artist and master,
turning out works in:old age which lack
the power and inspiration of former works,
and which in a measure dim the brilliance
of an otherwise sparkling legacy to his art
and reputation.

But such is not the case with Gerhart
Hauptmann. Hauptmann is himself over
eventy; but this fact reveals itself in this
play not through a weakening of mental
powers, or a maudlin sentimentality, but
rather through a deeper understanding of
the nature and feelings of an old man. This
thought is expressed’ by The Observer (Lon-
don):

“This is the work for which Germany has
waited for years, the culmination of Haupt-
mann’s life as a playwright, and what is
believed to be the most important literary
production in Germany of the -past few
years. Over seventy himself, Hauptmann
has written the history of a seventy-year-
old man, rich, respected, who maintains the
right to his own life in the face of all that
his grown-up family protest against. Mar-
ried sons and daughters declare that the
old man must be mad when he owns that
he loves a young woman considerably be-
neath himself in station.”

This play would be of particular appeal
to a person interested in human nature;
for it is essentially a study of conflict be-
tween human desires, and the eventual, out-
come. It is the psychological history eof a
man who, accustomed always to respect and
obedience from his family, finds suddenly
a concerted opposition on their part, to

| which he is unable to adjust himself at his

age.
It would be easier to treat such a situa-
tion, of an old man falling in love with a

young woman much below himself in sta-

well received and this year was no exception. |,

Rhodes Scholarships

Copies of the 1933 Memorandum
for the Rhodes Scholarships have just
been received by Dr. G. R. Vowles, in-
stitutional representative. There is no
change in the system of appointment,
the district plan having been contin-
ued. State elections, however, will be
somewhat later, January 2, 4, and 6,
1934, instead of in December, as here-
tofore. ;

It is well for candidates to inform
themselves early as to conditions, as
to opportunities at Oxford, etc. “Ox-
ford of Today” (second edition) by
Aydelotte, Crosby and Valentine, is
in the library and the latest “Hand-
book to the University of Oxford,”

. just published, has been ordered for
the library. Don’t wait until next No-
vember to read these books, when fif-
teen other men will want to read them
at the same time, but read them in
your spare time this spring.

Dr. Vowles will be glad to give ad-
vice or information to all interested.
He will furnish copies of the latest
“Memorandum.”

tion, with farcial humor, presenting ‘the
main character in a comical way. But
Hauptmann, with the profound insight of
a man who has himself come into closé
contact with life, presents this character
not as ridiculous, but as tragic.

The character portrayal in the play is
excellent. Before the completion of the first
act, one feels that he knows well each
character-——each child, with his varying de-
gree of. avarice toward the old man’s
wealth; each snobbish friend of the Geheim-
rat (the old man); his delightful friend,
Geiger, in reality a portrait of Professor
H. G. Feidler, of Oxford; the humble fam-
ily of the Peters; and the rest of the char-
acters who are involved in this interaction
of personalities.

One who has read a great deal of Haupt-
mann might fear lest he be disappointed
in this last play. But such a fear will quick-
ly be dispelled. For this work is in itself
a powerful study of human life.
