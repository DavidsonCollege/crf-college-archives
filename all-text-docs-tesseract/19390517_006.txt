the men who were selected from
the number that applied were cho-
sen on a-basis of four things;
the R. O. T. C. grade of the ap-
plicant for his Freshman and Soph-
omore year; the general grade of
the applicant; his Extra-Curricu-
lar activities; and his ability to
lead men. These four items were
combined and an average obtained.
From the result of this average,
the men were selected. These_men
who were selected for the advanced
course will automatically be pro-
moted to the rank of Cadet Sear-

PARADE OF OPINION

promote peace and international

friendship which will give Amer-
ica her just place as the bulwark
of the democratic systems of gov-
ernment.”

But, the University of Minnesota
Daily thoroughly disagrees with
this group, and maintains that
“Garner is no more than a small
time politician in spite of the per-
sistent attempts to, picture him as
an astute statesman blessed with
homely wisdom. Garner’s qualifica-
tions apparently consist of his abil-
ity to play poker, his position as a
conservative democrat, and his’ po-
litical adroitness in sabotaging the
New Deal. Considering all this, the
Garner boom seems unbelievable,
hut unfortunately it is a political
“reality.”

On the other hand, the McMur-
ray College War Whoop (also in
Texas) loudly whoops for his elec-
tion with these words: “Should he
be elected, he would serve the
purpose of classifying all of the
recent Roosevelt legislation, dis-
carding the worthless (of which
there is much) and strengthening
the few really valuable laws that
have been passed. ‘Cactus Jack,’
as dry as the plains of Texas, as
sharp as the thorns of a Texas mes-
quite, and with a heart as big and
as warm as the Texas from whence
he comes should logically be our
next democratic presidential nom-
inee.”

The President's efforts to make
his party a strong liberal party has
drawn strong praise from the Egyp-
tian of Southern Illinois Teachers
College : “President Roosevelt
should be commended by all pro-
gressive citizens of both parties
for his recent appeal to the Demo-
cratic party to definitely establish
itself as the liberal party. For many
years the words Democrat and Re-

publican have been more or less

noting the attitudes and policies of
the party members. There has been
an unnatural division among the
voters with all shades of liberals
and conservatives grouped together/
around the Democratic and Repub-
lican standards. It is to be \hoped
that Mr. Roosevelt will be success-
ful in his attempt to dispel the
magic of the words Democrat and
Republican and establish a new
political line-up of liberals vs. con-
servatives.”
