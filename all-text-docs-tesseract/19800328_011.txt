will lose his position. Martin
declined to comment on the
change, saying only that his
real concern was the continued
development of “the program
itself.”

Cartmill, who has been at
Davidson for six years, is the
only tenured member of the
athletics department. There is
no tenure track fro others in the
department, Zimmermann said.

Most distressing of all, no
one in the athletics department
seemed to be adequately in-
formed about the changes. Nei-
ther Cartmill, Martin, nor As-
sistant Athletic Director Tom
Couch knew that no new Athle-
tic Director would be hired;
Cartmill said he ‘‘assumed” one
would be. Two weeks after
Cartmill’s announcement that
he was resigning his director-
ship to work. ‘‘in the area of
physical education and recrea-
tional activities,’ Martin still
did not. know whether his own
position would be affected.
Couch had not heard whether
his post would be continued if
no Athletic Director were hired.
Zimmermann said he ‘‘as-
sumes” Couch will be assisting

the Intercollegiate Athletics Di-
rector in ‘‘administrative
work.”

Personnel is one of the areas
to. be affected by the $85,000
athletic budget cut, Zimmer-
mann said. There will be some
additional ‘‘overlap” in coach-
ing positions.

Personnel

“We've got to get the maxi-
mum mileage out of the stuff we
have. No college of our size can
afford one-sport coaches,”’ Zim-
mermann explained.

However, Martin had earlier
pointed out that one of the
major problems Davidson ath-
letics has had to face has been
“difficult combinations in the
intercollegiate area.” For ex-
ample, Martin said, it is unique
among colleges as far as he
knows for one coach to be
responsible for soccer, track,
and cross country.

Two coaches will not be
returning next year: Womien’s
basketball and field hockey
coach Susan Roberts has re-
signed and soccer and track
coach Karl Kremser’s contract
was not renewed.

None of the other coaches
have been notified of any chan-
ges in their job descriptions.
Women’s Athletics Director Pat
Miller said they were supposed
to be told by this time. “I hope
they'll let us know soon enough
so that if (the new position) is
not to the coaches’ liking they
can look elsewhere.”

According to Cartmill, he and
Zimmermann “‘in conjunction
with Martin” will decide on his
specific duties as well as Mar-
tin’s for next year.

Citing Martin’s work in the
development of Davidson athle-
tics’ “direst need,” better facili-
ties Cartmill said, ‘‘the two of
us could work together to give
this area more manpower:”’
Zimmermann said Martin ‘‘will

continue to. have some respon-
sibilities in the areas of physical
education and intramurals.”

The uncertainty among mem-
bers of the athletic department
regarding personnel matters ex-
tends to the broader area of
future athletic policy as well.

Couch said he has ‘‘no idea in
the least’’ what the athletic
strategy will be. He declined to
comment on the possible signi-
ficance of the results of indepen-
dent athletic evaluation to be
conducted April 9 and 10..
Money is the universal problem,
Couch admitted. “‘Our budget
hasn’t increased significantly
since 1974.” ‘‘Hopefully,” he
said, the cut ‘‘won’t be”
$85,000.’’ Financial problems,
will “hurt’ all ‘the sports. But
we'll make it.”

Martin said he was concerned
about the status of the physical
education program. “P.E. af-
fects every person in the stu-
dent body.’’ The program’s
efficiency, however, is severely
hampered by ‘administrative

problems” such as the lack of a

secretary.

“If the college feels athletics
is a part of the curriculum then
we need to sit-down and chart
our course with a definite goal
in mind,” Martin said.

Cartmill envisions a ‘‘trend
toward intramurals and recrea-
tion” in future athletic policy.
“We must determine what we
can afford and what we can’t.”
He cited development of general
student sports facilities and
women’s athletics as major
considerations.

Zimmermann said there was
no plan to draw up a new
strategy for athletics. The re-
port of the independent athletic
evaluation committee, which
will examine present policy, will
come too late to affect this
year’s budget and personnel
decisions.

‘‘We’re all just waiting,’’
Martin said, and his statement
echoed the sentiment evident
throughout the athletic depart-
ment, expressed most succinct-
ly perhaps by the secretary who
pleaded, ‘‘Please let us know
what’s going on.”

Frank cited inflation as the

‘major culprit in the budget

problem and said the only real
option now is to find a source of
additional revenue, such as
increased alumni giving.

Frank opposed the idea of
dropping down a division or two
in competition because he does .
not think that money will be
saved and feels alternate
sources of funds can be found.

Track and soccer coach Karl
Kremser echoed Frank’s opin-
ion of inflation. According to
Kremser, both the track and the
soccér programs are in ‘‘dire
straits” because of inflation and
he is afraid that a certain
amount of quality may have to
be sacrificed to keep the pro-
gram’s within budget.

Kremser agreed that there is

Overall; however, the atti-

frustration and some resent-
