Budget Blues

A federal budget which can build new bombers and
aircraft carriers but has to cut financial aid to studen-
ts says more about the country’s priorities than most
people would like to admit.

We like military hardware just as much as the next
warmonger but why can there be money for education
too? Many taxpayers will rejoice at the idea of a
slight tax break. especially when it involves a slap at
the ‘effete intellectual snobs” in their ivory tower.
The saddening thing is that Nixon's budget cuts are a
huge rip-off. These same taxpayers will find their
son's and daughter's tuition increased or their state
taxes increased to help state schools absorb the
shock. They'll pay somewhere, just as Davidson
College will pay.

Where will Davidson go for money? Our financial
resources are already strained by trying to build a
new Union and new student housing. We can't afford
to cut the size of our student body so what will be cut?
(Don't be surprised if you see the guesthouse being
remodeled to serve a long stint as a Union.)

Davidson could attempt to recruit low-income
students for the federal money they would guarantee,
but even that dubious practice wouldn't cover the
loss. Cutting the overall educational expenditure
while spreading the money out thinner mhay make
some people content, but it’s a sham as far as
education is concerned. Nixon is trying to get a few
points in the Gallup poll at the expense of American
students.

Locals Monopolize

In recent weeks the phenomenon of local com-
munity youths dominating college facilities to the
exclusion of students has increased beyond the point
of reasonable toleration.

Davidson students are finding themselves excluded
from using gym facilities. specifically the basketball
court. and union pool tables and pin ball games.
because they are occupied by youths from the David-
son area.

Sad it is indeed to conclude that rules regarding this
sort of thing must again be enforced. but the simple
fact remains that both the Union and the Gvmnasium
facilities. limited as they are. are intended primarily
for use by those within the college community.

It now appears that the situation is being remedied.
at least partially. in the Union where officials are
now making an effort to see that Union facilities
are available for students any time they desire to use
them.

We would like to commend those Union officials tor
their renewed efforts along these lines. It is hoped
that this example will in turn be followed in the Gvm
so that those students who wish to use it will always
be able to do so.

We express regret that the college should in this
way close itself to the community at large but we feel
that it is the college's place to provide activities first
for Davidson students. instead of for those people who
inno way contribute to its financial support.

Perhaps there will come a day when college
tacilities can provide recreation tor students and
local vouths alike. but under the limitations of the
present physical plant. this is not possible.

Welcomed Firsts

If you have perused the editorial column thus far
and are in need of cheerful words, please flip back to
page one and notice the early admissions figures.
especially those concerning next year’s freshmen
women. Nothing pleases us more than running in-
formation of this sort, and though 13 women may
seem a drop in the bucket. consider them to be the
welcome@# firsts of many more to come.

Kennedy

Escapes New Turks,

Then Gives In To ‘Gobble’

They struck Reggie Kennedy
last year with fierceness. A
mad intensity. It was a bitter al-
tack on a part of Davidson the
likes of which we'd never seen
before

Reggie fled to Califorma He
moved back to Washington. He
knew they were hunting him.
keeping him away for a pur-
pose. Kennedy became’ a
beaten. debilitated non-person
He murmured only one
phrase—"“The Turks ~~ Again.
but much softer. “The New
Turks. here.”

For his whole life Kennedy
had been an all-round. clean-cut
good guy. When the Turks made
their move on Davidson he was
the first they attacked. Reggie
was conspicuous in his sport-
coat and button-down shirt. The
New Turks began an assault to
drive him out of school. out of
his mind.

After a six-month's exile Ken-
nedy was allowed to come back.
He was at once what their
motive had been. In the time he
had been away, the college
Union had been destroyed. The
New Turks had done their job.

It is only today, a year after
his terrifying flight that Ken-
nedy can talk of what happened.
Even now, though, he speaks
cautiously, his voice dropping
into lowest pitches while his
eyes watch all entrances.

He talks of the birth of these
New Turks. Reggie saw them
begin in 1969. Innocently
enough, then. A protest. a rally.
Some demonstration of power,
flexing political muscles. A
mastermind was certainly
behind all that he saw. and his
cruel scheme continues today.

The New Turks were then
dormant for a few years. Their
activity was highly secretive
They spoke. no doubt. of a
Davidson destiny. Of how to
gain control. how to use it
History of their period of for-
mulation is scanty Kennedy
