After a strong performance at the Patriot Games on Jan. 27,

the men’s track and field team again left its mark last weekend

at the Carolina Classic in Chapel Hill, N.C.

Alex Hoyt ’09 earned SoCon Indoor Men’s Track Performer
of the Week, running 8:44.63 in the 3000 meters.

After rewriting his own shot put school record at the Patriot
Games just one weekend before, Will Funderburg ’09 bested his
mark with a new school record throw of 15.43 meters to earn
first place in the competition. Funderburg also competed in the
weight throw, marking 13.45 meters and earning a sixth place
finish.

On the track, the Wildcats also made great strides. Alex Hoyt
’09, the reigning SoCon Runner of the Week, finished with an
impressive eighth-place finish out of over 40 competitors in the

3000 meters with a time of 8:44.63. Tom Divinnie ’10 and Sam
Morris ’08 also turned in noteworthy performances on the day in
the 5000 meters. Divinnie’s time of 15:33.50 was good enough
to earn him 11th place while Morris’s time of 15.42.53 gave him
14th.

“We had some great performances, including Will Funderburg
besting his own school record in the shot put,” Hoyt said. “On
the distance side, Sam Morris and Tom Divinnie qualified for the
fast heat of the 5000 meters at the SocCon meet. This is all good,
but people should remember that I am the SoCon Player of the
Week. Just kidding.”

“We had some great performances,
including Will Funderburg besting
his own school record in the shot
put.”

On the women’s side, the track and field team also had a
notable show at the Carolina Classic. Leading the team once
again was team captain Brenna Burns ’08. Burns was named the
SoCon Women’s Indoor Track Performer of the Week and the
SoCon Student-Athlete of the Week for the week of Jan.
29. After finishing first at the Patriot Games Jan. 27 in the 3000
meters, Burns had a repeat performance at the Carolina Classic,
edging out the competition to bring the Wildcats a first-place fin-
ish with a time of 10:01.04. Other outstanding Wildcat women
included Carolina Sanker ’09, who finished third in the 3000
meters with a time of 10:09.04.

For the sprinters, Amaka Obidegwu ’08 placed 44th for the
Wildcats in the 400 meters with a time of 1:02.07.

Both the men’s and women’s track and field teams will con-
tinue their season at the Tiger Invitational at Clemson
University, February 15.

* Women’s basketball falters on the road

By PATRICK MCARDLE

The Wildcat women’s basketball team could not continue its
five-game winning streak on the road last week, losing
Conference games against Western Carolina 80-57 and
Chattanooga 73-62.

Western Carolina snapped the streak on Saturday afternoon
despite another stellar performance by Mercedes Robinson ’09,
who tallied 13 points and 11 rebounds for her third straight dou-
ble-double. All of her points came in the second half. Honna
Housley ’08 also reached double digits in scoring with 11 points,
nine of which came in the first half.

Unfortunately, these two individual performances could not
match the Catamounts team effort. The collective performance
of five bench players yielded 48 points for Western Carolina:
Ashley Pellom scored 14 points, Emily Clarke tallied 12 and
Kendra Carroll added another 10.

Davidson suffered from 13 turnovers which Western Carolina
converted into 20 points. Taking advantage of this differential
throughout the game, the Catamounts pushed their first half
advantage to 21, but the Wildcats chipped away at the lead to go
into the half down 18 points. Despite grinding the lead down to
15, Davidson could not overcome Western’s significant advan-
tage and lost 80-57.

Although showing a better team effort against Chattanooga,
Davidson could not overcome Alex Anderson’s incredible 39
point performance on Monday night. Housley, originally from
Tennessee, matched her career-high of 18 points in front of
friends and family. Robinson and Julia Paquette ’10 both joined
Housley in double figures with 13 and 12 points, respectively.

While the Wildcats were able to close the first half within
eight points, Anderson dominated the second half. She answered
every Davidson run in the second half, shooting 14-24 from the
field and draining 11 free throws.

Even though Davidson outshot the Mocs by hitting 42.9 per-
cent of its shots compared to the Mocs’ 39.7 percent, the only
shot 4-16 from three-point range.

Honna Housley ’08 hit-double digits in both games last
week, scoring a career high 18 points against the Mocs.

The team’s two losses drop its record to 13-9 overall and 7-4
in the SoCon. The Wildcats will end their road trip on Saturday
against Appalachian State. Davidson defeated Appalachian State
80-65 in a prior meeting this season in Belk Arena and expect to
salvage this current road trip by beating the Mountaineers in
Boone.
