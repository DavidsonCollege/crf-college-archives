Bench player i is Southern’s top sixth man

For Ben Ebong, enthusiasm was
never the problem.

The redshirt junior’s passion and
eagermess to better the men’s basketball
team were never in doubt. But early this
season, controlling that enthusiasm was
sometimes an issue.

THE SPARK —

“Ben has a tremendous sense of
charisma and enthusiasm and he has
really learned to harness that,” said
coach Bob McKillop. “To get the rusti-
ness out of his game took tremendous
intelligence and discipline on his part.”

All of that hard work is starting to
show. Over the last seven games, Ebong
has averaged 12.6 points — posting
double digits in each of those contests
— and.seven rebounds, while shooting
close to 60 percent from the field. He’s
averaging nine points and six boards
this season, and has recorded two
double-doubles.

“He is certainly putting up the sta-
tistics to earn a starting nod on many
teams,” said McKillop. “But what he
does coming off of the bench makes
him more valuable for us.”

And that is to provide a spark plug
in the Wildcats’ line-up.

“T guess it just comes naturally,”
said the 6-foot-6, 220-pound forward.

“T’ma very emotional person and I play
witha lot emotion. I want to have fun on
the court, but at the same time I want to
do whatever this team needs for us to
win.”

Recently, Ebong has done both.

One of the few Wildcats — not
only onthis year’s team, but in Davidson
basketball history — who can bring the
crowd to its feet with a monster jam,

’ Ebong takes full advantage of his dunk-

ing ability.

Just ask league nemesis Appala-
chian St.

Twice this year, an Ebong dunk
lifted the Wildcats over the Mountain-
eers.

In the teams’ first meeting Jan. 31
in Boone, Ebong found a seam in the
Appalachian zone in the game’s final
minute, took a feed from Ali Ton, and
gave Davidson the lead for good with a
thunderous slam.

And in the Wildcats’ convincing
68-58 victory Thursday, Ebong thwarted
asecond-half Mountaineer rally by driv-
ing the lane and serving a facial to
Mountaineer Marshall Phillips.

“Tf that’s what it takes to make this
team better, that’s what I will do,” ex-
plained Ebong.

“Ttake pride in anything I doon the
court. I like playing the part of a utility
man.”

It is that kind of attitude that kept
Ebong going through the rough times

. — like last season, his redshirt year,

when Ebong watched games not wear-
ing his trademark No. 42, but rather

sporting a suit and suspenders on the
bench.

Although Ebong practiced with
the team a year ago, he was unable to
compete in games.

“Myself and the coaches did not
look atit as an off year,” said the Omaha,
Neb., native. “It was sometimes hard
not being the focal point, but the coaches
‘stuck with me and the focus was always
on getting better.”

Coming into the season, the ex-
pectations were high for Ebong. De-
spite playing in only 23 games — the
equivalent of not even one full season
— in his first two collegiate years and
averaging just over four points, some
thought Ebong would be the successor
to last year’s leading scorer and all-
conference performer Narcisse Ewodo.

“The expectations were very high
for Ben,” said McKillop.

“In his first two seasons with us,
he was a role player. This year, he

comes in witha high label, and when he ©

didn’t perform at the level people ex-
pected, it was tough to deal with.”

But like the Wildcats, Ebong has
bounced back.

“It just took a while for me to get
back mentally,” said Ebong. “It was
just a matter of time until I found my
comfort zone and settled down.”

Having rewritten his personal

record book this season, the goal-now -

for Ebong?

“What it has always been: to get
better everyday and learn something
from every game.”

Pressure is not something new to
the men’s basketball team this season.

“Pressure has been an experience
this team has faced all season long,”
said coach Bob McKillop.

Tae History _

“From the first game at Duke to
the expectation of this team winning
the conference championship, this
team has faced challenge after chal-
lenge.”

And undoubtedly, the upcoming
challenge is the biggest.

This weekend, the Wildcats —
17-9, 13-2, North Division champi-
ons, and the No. 1 seed— will fight for
an NCAA berth in the Southern Con-
ference tournament in Greensboro.
Win the tournament, advance to the
Big Dance. Lose the tournament, go
home and ponder a failed season.

“It all comes down to winning
three straight basketball games,” said
McKillop. “That is the reality and the
nature of Division I basketball at this
level, so the pressure is on every-
body.”

It has been 12 years since
Davidson made the coveted NCAA
field of 64. Since 1994, yearsin which
the Wildcats undoubtedly had the tal-
ent to win the tourney and automati-
cally go to the NCAAs, the league
tourney has caused nothing but heart-
ache for Davidson fans.

In 1994’s conference champion-
ship in Asheville, Brandon Williams
missed a shot at the buzzer, as Chatta-
nooga nipped the Wildcats 65-64. Af-
tera subpar regular season in the 1994-
| 95 season, Davidson fell to Western
Carolina 78-74 in the quarterfinals.

And then there is the sad story of

Past failures add to pressure

and the Wildcats hope to
erase past failures in the
conference tournament.
two. years .ago.. After cruising to an
unblemished 14-0 conference mark and
winning the first two games of the
league tournament, the Wildcats were
shocked in the final by Western.

Last year, Davidson was stopped
in the semifinals by eventual Sweet 16
participant Chattanooga, 77-70.

“We’re right there every time,”
said guard Davor Halbauer. “It be-
comes frustrating to come so close and
lose. It’s about time to go through the
tourney, take that step forward, and
make the NCAAs.”

With the tournament only a few
days away, Davidson again finds itself
as the favorite.

And while the pressure will be
there, it has been there all season for
the Wildcats. :

Perhaps the demanding non-con-
ference schedule McKillop and his
staff put together, which caused such
frustration early on, will give the Wild-
cats that killer instinct they lacked in
the postseason in the recent past.

Said McKillop: “The only way to
get good at handling pressure is by
handling pressure.”

The fine line between a success-
ful and failed season will again be
determined this weekend.

Late-season run leads to optimism for tourney

failures? Perhaps because of the early-
season failures?
“That’s kept us grounded in real-
ity,” said senior 1 ,000-point scorer Mark
Donnelly after the Wildcats’ critical

THE Preview

win Thursday over Appalachian St.
“Because of all the losses we suffered
early, no matter what we do now, we’ll
never be able to live up to preseason
expectations.”

And what was seen as catastrophic
in the second week of January now
looks like something of a blessing in
disguise.

With the prospect of a ranking or
upsets over national powerhouses long
gone, the Wildcats shifted their focus to
simply getting better everyday.

“I don’t think there’s any pres-
sure,” Ben Ebong said. “It’s just a
matter of having fun. If we just forget
about the scoreboard, we’ll be success-
ful. If we come in loose and play hard
and play with a lot of confidence, that
should carry us.”

Said coach Bob McKillop: “We
fell, and fell dramatically, and hit rock

" bottom in the second week of January.”

And now?

“We've been playing passion- ~

ately,” the ninth-year head coach re-
sponded.

Indeed.

A greater focus on pounding the
ball inside, which started most notably
in the Wildcats’ first win over Appala-
chian Jan. 31 in Boone, has (1) made the
most of Davidson’s individual talents
inside, and (2) created more open looks
for the team’s shooters on the perim-
eter.

The result?

Stephen Marshall, who came up
with a bohemoth 20-point, 14-rebound

effort in the season opener Nov. 20 at
Duke and essentially disappeared for
the next six weeks, has become a night-
in-night-out scoring and rebounding
presence in the paint.

Ebong has scored in double fig-
ures in nine of the 12 games since the
VMI loss, including a team-high and
career-best 17 points in the pivotal come-
from-behind win Jan. 17 at Furman.

Landry Kosmalski has shown
flashes — extended flashes — of the
form that enabled him to garner South-
ern Conference Freshman- of- the- Year
honors last season.

Chadd Holmes, perhaps the best
pure talent in the group, has made the
most of his minutes. His 16 points in
only 15 minutes at Boone were instru-
mental.

And Davidson’s defense, which
spurred last year’s successful late-sea-
son stint, has worked similar magic. In
four of the final five regular season
games, the Wildcats held their oppo-
nents to under 40 percent shooting from

the floor, as the squad has confused
teams by constantly: switching its de-
fensive sets.

With Saturday’s victory, Davidson
now boasts a phenomenal 22-1 record
in February. games over the past three
seasons, the one loss coming last Feb. 3
against Marshall in Huntington, W.Va.

“Our success in February has been
extraordinary,” McKillop confirmed.
“It’s just a natural progression. Our
players practice so hard and play so
hard.

“But the success I want to see is
success in March.”

And if Davor Halbauer’s mental-
ity. is any indication, confidence is no
problem at all.

“We've been ready since late Janu-
ary when we started to play better,” the
starting guard said Saturday. “I’m sure
we’re going to reach our best next week
in Greensboro. We’ve gottotake what's
ours. —

“Tt’s about time for us to take the
nextstep forward and goto the NCAAs.”
