Shakespeare class performs Twelfth Nightfor school

Throughout this weekend the
English 212 “Performing Shakes-
peare Comedy” class will give
their production of William
Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night in
Lingle Chapel. The production is
part of the overall grade in the
class. The students, under the gui-
dance of Professor Cynthia
Lewis, have each taken a role in
the play in addition to dividing re-
sponsibilities such as costuming,
publicity and props. Using re-
search and scholarly interpreta-
ion, and directing the play as an
ensemble, the class hopes to pre-
sent a production as close a possi-
ble to the style and manner of the
Elizabethan theater of Shakes-

peare’s time.

Lewis explained that the stu-
dents use performance as a means
of critical analysis.

“One doesn’t really under-
stand any play until one looks at it
from the inside,” she said. “I had
written two articles on the play be-
fore starting it with this class, and
already I’ve learned much more
than I had known before.”

Never was identity more mis-
taken than in this Shakespearean
romantic comedy. First published
in the 1623 Folio, Twelfth Night
tells the story of a young woman,
Viola, shipwrecked off the coast
of Illyria, who disguises herself as
a man in order to serve the Duke

Orsino. Orsino is suffering from
unrequited love for the Countess
Olivia and sends Viola to woo her,
but Olivia, believing Viola to be a
man, falls in love with her instead.
A subplot involves Olivia’s rowdy
uncle, Sir Toby Belch, and his
cohorts, Maria, Sir Andrew Au-
guecheek, and Fabian, who cont-
rive to trick Olivia’s puritanical
steward, Malvolio, into believing
she harbors a secret love for him.
Twelfth Night contains the infam-
ous “letter scene” in which Mal-
volio is duped by the revelers into
foolishly dressing in yellow cross-
gartered stockings to impress his
bewildered mistress.

The cast has been entirely re-

sponsible for making and decorat-
ing the sets, choreographing the
action on stage, and providing
costumes, as well as all other ele-
ments of the production.

The cast includes senior For-
rest Williams as Orsino, sopho-
more Max Currie as Viola/
Cesario, junior Catherine Norton
as Olivia, sophomore Elizabeth
Dick as Feste the jester, sopho-
more Lance Luckey as Sebastian,
senior Alison McGill as Antonio,
sophomore Lee Eichelberger as
Sir Toby Belch, junior Steve
Mank as Sir Andrew Au-
guecheek, junior Wayne Mag-
ruder as Malvolio, senior Anne
Lambert as Maria, senior Katie

Vivian Lester remains faithful to her calling

By NELLE MCCORKLE

After working all day as a
Charlotte Human Services secret-
ary, Reverend Vivian Lester often
sleeps until 11 p.m. before wak-
ing to study the Bible. She reads
until three or four a.m., then goes
back to sleep until she rises at six
a.m. to begin another workday.
Assistant pastor Reeves Temple
African Methodist Episcopal Zion
(AME ZION) Church, Lester
maintains this schedule because
she considers Bible study essen-
tial.

“I really stress this to people

read and know _ the
Word . . . The Word is the only
thing that’s going to defeat the
Devil, so if you don’t know the
Word, you’re going to live a de-
feated life. Get that Word hid
down in your heart, so when you
need it, it'll be there.”

A minister since 1982, Lester
joined Reeves Temple when she
was 12 years old. “I’ve always
been active in the church, even as
a child,” she said. “I continued to
be active before I received my sal-
vation — I sang in the choirs, I
worked as youth director.”

Of her decision to become a
minister, Lester said, “it was

something I didn’t want to do — I

tried to get out of going into the
ministry by teaching a Bible class
for children, but I didn’t have
peace within myself. It was as if
there was a void, and this was be-
cause I was not in the complete
will of God. I wasn’t where He
wanted me to be: he wanted me to
be a minister. A lot of things hap-
pened . . . God was showing me
His will through His word and
through His dealing. When I said,
‘okay, I'll do it,’ it was as if a bur-
den had just lifted.”

Lester’s duties as assistant
pastor include preaching once a
month, assisting Pastor Thomas
Lee with communication and con-
gressional visitation, and subsitut-
ing during services he is unable to
attend. She also serves as Sunday
school superintendant, frequent
adult teacher, substitue in all de-
parments, and choir gospel mem-
ber.

Asked whether being a David-
son native helps her in her minis-
try, Lester said, “I don’t know
whether it does . . . Sometimes
when people know you in the
community, it’s hard for them to
separate you from the individual
they know in the community into a
sacred position, as they would call

it.”

In addition to her Reeves
Temple responsibilities, Lester
works on the town’s Community
Relations Committee, speaks at
area churches, and participates in
an interdenominatioal interces-
sory prayer group which meets on
saturdays in members’ homes and
served on a recent college com-
munity relations committee.
Mooresville radio station WHIP
broadcasts “Good News,” her
program of “little nuggets or ser-
monettes,” each Sunday from
8:15-8:30 a.m.

“My main objective,” Lester
said, “is first of all being faithful
and true to my calling as a minister
and to do what God would have
me to do as part of the body of
Christ.” Lester’s future plans in-
clude the establishment of a
Davidson shelter: “One thing |
want to go into is starting a Love
Center — you know, if some-
body’s walking down the street
and feels as if nobody cares, it'd
be a place where they could go and
talk to somebody or read the Word
of God... It would just be a
place of refuge, . . . in love in the

Greek, agape love . . . with no
conditions. It would be a place
with no conditions, and I'll be try-
ing to reach mostly the lowest be-
cause Jesus’ main purpose for
coming here was to save the low-
est, and as disciples, that should
be our main objective.”

“Being a minister is really a
joy to me, because... . you can
help somebody in the darkness see
the light and see how God can
change their lives and set them
free from the bondages of
sin... 1 enjoy preaching the
Word of god and sharing Jesus
with others,” Lester said. “I felt
within my spirit that this was what
God was calling me to do,” she
said of her ministry. “It's sort of
hard to put into words, but you
just know what the Holy Spirit is
impressing within your spirit.”

Before becoming a minister
and a Human Services secretary,
Lester worked for Social Ser-
vices’ Dalton Village Day Care
Center in Charlotte as a toddler
teacher and aide from 1975-1981.
prior to that time, Mecklenburg

as a teacher’s aide during 1970-
1975.

Lester attended Ada Jenkins
Elementary School and graduated
from Hunterville’s Torrence Lytle
High School. She has participated
in Hood Seminary’s continuing
education program and plans to
pursue a religion degree there in
September.

Lester and her husband Wil-
liam Lester, a Goodyear front-end
mechanic, live with her mother,
Katie White. The Lesters’ son,
Chris, is a tenth-grader at North
Mecklenburg High Scheol, and
their daughter, Sharyl, works at
Suzy Curtains. Vivian Lester
said, “Everybody pitches in, and
my mother is'a big great help.
When we come home we don't
have to cook, because she cooks
for us every night.”

“| have come through some
times where I had to stand by my-
self for beliefs, but the battle is the
Lord's,” Lester said. “We don't
have to fight our battles: all you do
is read the Word and speak the
Word, and the Lord wil do the
rest.”
