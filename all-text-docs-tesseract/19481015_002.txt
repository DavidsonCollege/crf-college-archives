our band performed. Moving out onto the
darkened field between the howling hordes
in the touchdown-hungry State stands on one
side and the downhearted Davidson stands
on the other, the band commenced to awe
the entire crowd with their f fancy figures,
shown up in the stadium darkness only by
the tiny sketches. of light from red-globed
flashlights on their shoes. After the figures
honoring the two teams, they formed an out-
line of the State of North Carolina, and while
a lively artificial moon drifted over the state,
the whole stands joined in with one voice to
sing ‘‘Carolina Moon.” It was a_ thrilling
spectacle for which Mr. Pfohl and the entire
band deserve a ‘“‘hat’s off.” Maybe even the

From the Editors

LONNIE TURNIPSEED

The increasing interest of the
student body, as a whole, in na-
tional and international affairs has
become quite apparent in this first
month of the school year. This has
been particularly noticed in those
organizations which are primarily
concerned with these affairs, name-
ly the International Relations Club
and the World Federalists. The
World Federalists report a mem-
bership of approximately _ thirty,
while the IRC has the largest mem-
bership in it's history, with ap-
proximately ninety-nine enrolled,

A short time ago’ Dr. Cunning-
fiam remarked that he was very
glad to see the students taking a
active interest along these
lines. The Editors agree whole-
heartedly with Dr. Cunningham and
wish to foster his new spirit. of
participation in world affairs in so
far as we are able. We feel that
the DAVIDSONIAN, in addition
to your daily newspapers, can play
an active part in this interest, by
serving as an outlet for student
views and opinions.

As. college students,

now to follow the current of pres-
day politics, particularly with

precautions to see that, before form-

Operating Table

This past week end proved pret-
ty disasterous for the Wildcat ag-
gregation at Raleigh, but capitaliz-
ing on the events of the week end
were a great many distant and lo-

Probably the most extended trip
of the week end was taken by

Professors Are Auman

By BOB GRUBE

PROFESSOR HENGEVELD

Fred William Hengeveld, B. Si
came to Davidson as a member of
the faculty in 1920; and is now
in his 28th year of work here.

Mr. Hengeveld was born in
Palatka, Florida, and spent his boy-
hood there and in Savannah and
Waycross in; Georgia. He entered
Davidson in 1914 and, having not
suffered the drawback .of E’s and
F's, graduated in 1918. After re-
ceiving his degree, Mr, Hengeveld
did graduate work at the Univer.

sity of Chicago, and joined the’

United States Marines Corps in
which he served as an instructor at
Quantico. In 1920 he returned to
Davidson as baseball and basket-
ball coach which he continued for
five years, Also in 1920 he was the
principal | of the Davidson High
School for one year, becoming
Davidson's registrar in the fall of
the same year. I trust that the fact
that Mr. Hengeveld is and has
been an active member of the local
draft board will not be held against

him or give cause to shy away fan
his office. In recognition of his
work in this important service, he
was awarded a medal and_ special
service certificate of merit.

During’ the years as a student
here, Mr. Hengeveld played both
baseball and basketball, so success-
fully as to captain the former team
for one year and the latter for
three years, While in the Marine
Corps he continued to play with
service teams, and after returning
to Davidson he played pro baseball
in the summers of '20,.'21, and ’22;
with the Little Rock, Dkansasi
team. When talking to Mr. Henge-
veld I found that his pride lies in
his course record among the faculty
on the local golf course, rather
than so much so in the aforemen
tioned sports,

While an undergraduate student
he was a brother of the Kappa
Sigma and Omicron Delta Kappa
fraternities, and is today a member
of the Masonic Order,
