CAT CHAT

By LACY MacLEAN

Grunt ’n’ Groan
Coach Charlie Parker's wrestling team, with onc
road to a successful year.

In booking Maryland, Washington and Lee, and North
Carolina, the wrestlers signed up to face the three teams
whose reputation through the years is always the best.
Year in and yéar out, they’re the top of the circuit. Add
to these three V. M..I. who licked Carolina; throw in
V. P. I., one of the South’s strongest, and you have an
ambitious schedule for anybody.

On top of their. schedule the Cat) grapplers are facing other
troubles. Keyhole Browning, almost a sure shot for at
three points in the’ 121 pound class left scheol for the army
and inexperienced Clyde Stroupe, his successor, has been unable
to go the limit against any of his opponents to date a
destined to lose to the Southern Confetence Champion whom
he must encounter Saturday,

Last year the Generals topped the Cats by a close margin,
and with four conference champs in competition again,
will be heavily favored to take the Cats. Aylor. winner in
the tournament’s heavyweight division last year, lost to the
State heavyweight whom Hipp defeated; this unreliable
figuring gives Hipp an edge over the W. & L. wrestler,
but may mean nothing on the mat.

Barefoot Boys
A somewhat comical note is the only news from Coach
Pete Whittle’s indoor trackmen. The war situation has
cut out the supply of indoor track shoes, and there is a
definite possibility that the Davidson delegation may enter
the competition barefooted.
Seriously though, Coach Whittle
place in conference standing when the

cal size of the
squads,
With Taylor almost a sure shot to take a first in the low
hurdles, and a possible place in the highs, and Shannon with
a few points, in the pole vault, the Cats may come through
in a satisfying manner if some of the other members of the
squad, any of whom may count a few markers, are able to
get through the preliminaries.

Sul Gains

Grid front the situatio
its of hard work, with few
to clear the way for a talented array of backs. The numerical
strength of the frosh eleven, or rather the frosh fifty of last
fall is still evident with approximately 23 of the fifty candidates.

Basketball Bulletin

A late report on the courtmen’s encounter in Spartan-
burg Monday night puts them back in the win column with

a 37-31 victory over the Wofford Terriers.

Dave Speneer, captain forthe night, with ten points and Mac
Bruce, whose eye is improving with 15, led the
Cat's offensive punch.

The Terriers, winners over Clemson by a large margin,
provided stiff opposition for their visitors, but the Presby-
terians held the lead throughout most of the contest. The |
scoreboard at half-time read Davidson 15; Wofford 10.

Next week-end finds the basketéers journeying to Charles
ton for games with the College of Charleston and The Citadel,
which may prove to be the Cats first conference victory. The
Bulldogs, weakened seve rly by graduation stand near Day idson
on the bottom of the conference ladder after dropping a one
point decision to Clemson’s lowly Tigers.

It is highly possible that the Cats may end up the season
with a much better record than they now possess. With
their hardest circuit contests behind them and encounters
with Furman and Citadel, both reputedly weak, and one
with South Carolina, second ranking outfit in the Confer-
ence whom the Cats came near upsetting inytheir first
game, the win column may grow substantially without any
swelling in the losses.
