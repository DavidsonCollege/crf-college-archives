The Eumenean Society meeting on
last Saturday night proved to be quite
interesting, although the debate was
somewhat lacking in pep. In the absence
of the president the vice-president tuok
charge of the meeting.

After the usual devotional exercises
and the reading of the minutes, it was
moved and carried that there should be
only three debaters on each side for that
evening. ‘he subject for debate was:
“Resolved, ‘Vhat Secretary Daniels’ re-
cent naval program should be adopted.”
Mr. ‘Turner was excused and Mr. C. B.
Robson was appointed to take his place
in defending the affirmative.

Matthews, the first speaker for the
affirmative, stated the terms of the pro-
gram and outlined its history. W. B.
Dunlap brought out several good points.
He showed that America needed a larger
navy not only to protect herself, but to
help enforce the laws of the League of
Nations. C. B. Robson delivered an ex-
cellent debate, considering the fact that
he had not been able to make preparation
beforchand. He suggested an increase
of our navy as a possible sulution of the
industrial questions incident to the re-
turn of our soldiers.

Askew spoke first for the negative. He
corrected the affirmative’s misstatement
of the question and showed that an in-
crease of our navy would destroy that
friendship between England and Amer-
ica which is so necessary for the peace of
the world. Doggett showed lack of
preparation and was unable to bring for-
ward any effective points. Gilmer point-
ed out the fact that America already has
a large navy and showed that an_in-
crease of our navy is not only unneces-
sary but in view of the war debt, foolisl.

The house, as well as the committee,

rendere its decision in favor of the
afirmative.
Grille gave as his declamation “A

Eulogy on Lincoln at Gettysburg.”
Gunn followed him with “Wilson's Re-
ply to the Pope.” Both of the gentle-
men suffered from nervousness, but did
well for their first appearance on the
program. Harrell failed to deliver his
oration.

As there was no further business the
house was declared adjourned,

Phi Society.

A very successful program was carried

out by the Phi Society Saturday night. In

ed into the society,

The query for debate was: “Reso!v-
ed, ‘That Secretary Daniels’ recent nava!
program should be adopted.” “Te at-
firmative side being absent, Roberts,
Howell and ‘T. R. Alexander were ap
pointed to substitute for them. Robert:
gave a good speech but he lacked the
necessary oratorical — force. Howell!
brought out several poifts on the ain
ative side. “T. R. Alexander gave a very
good speech and had some good aigi
ments. “The negative side was well sup-
ported. E.G. Lilly spoke with pep and
His speech was well presented
and his points were clearly — outlined.
Clark had a good speech but was a little
