He said he will enforce
wholeheartedly the recommen-
dations of the Task Force on
Minority Concerns and work to
diversify the student ‘body in

Robert Perkins

New member of the English
department Robert Perkins re-
ceived a BA in English and history
from the University of Alabama
and aBA in English Language and
_Literature from Oriel College of
~ Oxford University as a Rhodes
scholar. He is presently working
toward his Ph.D. in English at the
University of Virginia, where he
taught as a graduate student.

Perkins is especially im-
pressed with the Davidson honor
code. Although UVa has a similar
code, he feels that UVa’s.is less
enforcable becuase of the size of

the student body. He said David- .

son’s honor code is “a spendid
system to live under because it
gives students and faculty so
much freedom.”

ing geographic diversity. Hen-
drix also hopes to work with
Dean Rusk Program director
Jack Perry to increase the
number of international stu-
dents at Davidson.

Hendrix believes financial
aid policy, particularly regard-
ing merit scholarships, will be a
significant issue in the near fu-
ture. As he explained, the pool
of 18 year-olds has been steadily
declining along with SAT
scores. The result of these trends
is a decrease in the pool of above
average applicants. Davidson
must compete with.schools like
Duke, Emory, and Wake
Forest, all of which have strong
merit scholarship programs.

Hendrix said he chose to re-
turn to Davidson in part because
he was interested in reentering
the field of higher education.

The most refreshing differ-
ence he has found at Davidson is
that students are generally bright-
er and more easy-going than
others he has taught.

However he said that even
among Davidson students, there

are many who can’t analyze con-—

ceptually because they think with
their feelings. Brown believes that
one of his most challenging. re-
sponsibilities is to teach students
how to think analytically.
