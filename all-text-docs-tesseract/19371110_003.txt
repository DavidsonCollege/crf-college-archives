what sort of reaction this would}
produce among the Davidson stu-
dents, so we asked a number of
them this question: “Do you think
that the ‘Davidson spirit’ is a real-
ity, and if so, is it over rated?” As
usual, we got varied answers, but
most seemed to feel that the old
spirit even if dormant, is still here

First Winthrop Day
Instituted In 1898

Winthrop-Davidson Day was
by no means a “brain-child” of
the class of '38. According to ac-

curate information, such an oc
casion took place as far back
as 1898.

In the 1898 ‘Quips and Cranks’

in a calendar of events for the

year is the following statement:
