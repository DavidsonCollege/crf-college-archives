and from pre-season dope we are going to have a worthy
team. In the past, Davidson’s basketball teams have al-
ways been respected, and, to a certain extent, feared. This
year is to be no exception. Most of these men have had
high school experience, though only one—guess who-- has
ever really played college ball before.
Coach Shepard and his ability, | warn all opposition not
to take the Wildcats lightly. They are no breeze.

The thermometer is dropping, the wind is blowing, and
in general it is getting cold around the campus of Davidson.
Football is gone and basketball has a while before it comes
into its own. The only sport to be found now is yelling
at the freshmen. And if that durn White Horse throws
another bucket of water in my room, I’m going to have
some great sport.
