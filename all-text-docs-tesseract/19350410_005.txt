This is a good entertainment from
the flying start to the fisal happy land-

passions and patriotic fervor. Wallace
Beery and Lewis Stone are the fond
fathers of two aviators in the process
of incubation, and give commending per-
formances. Maureen O’Sullivan is love-

gives the most remarkable performance
of his career. Lewis Stone, type-per-
fect as the general, James Gleason, Rus-

The next morning, the entire
crew spent a delightful hour at
the Richmond police station where
they were accorded the privilege
of paying five bucks for running
their brand new 13 ton bus over
a 7'% ton bridge.

‘Cordin’ to reports all had a swell time
except the police, one of whom was
heard to remark, “This ain't no play-
house, boys,” and after a brief period
of parley the cindermen embarked for
via a new bridge.
