Football team improves record with victory over Sewanee

By Mike ANDERSON
Staff Writer

Halftime score: Davidson 2,
Sewanee 0.

Yes, this is the football article.

The Wildcat defense produced an
epic first half performance—including
a blocked punt recovered for a safety—
against The University of the South
(Sewanee) on Saturday, and Davidson
was able to emerge victorious from the
overtime period to improve their record
to 1-1.

Neither team’s offense could gen-
erate a scoring drive in the first half.
The ‘Cats caught a break early, after
quarterback Tom Dugan’s pass was in-
tercepted at midfield and returned for
an apparent touchdown by Sewanee
cornerback Jason Hamilton. The touch-
down was called back on an illegal-
blocking penalty, and Sewanee drove
down to Davidson’s 23 before a delay
of game penalty followed by a Wildcat
sack forced the Tigers to punt.

With a little under four minutes left in
the first quarter, a 3"-down sack forced

defeating Morehead State University
by a score of 4 to 1. The victory was a
welcome change from their five previ-
ous losses including a tough 2-1 defeat
last Tuesday to Southern Conference
rival Furman College.

“We’re happy to get a win,” said
head coach Kevin Hundley. “We played
well and dominated the game. We
played well enough to win the game.”
Junior mid-fielder Kelly Rennick was

equally as pleased with the victory. “It .

was a much needed victory,” Rennick
said. “Morehead is not known as a big
soccer school. We just need to move
forward and take it to the next level.”
The Lady Wildcats were extremely
focused heading into the Morehead State
game and controlled the match from
beginning to end. Two minutes and 19
seconds into the game freshman Carolyn
Stumpf, who scored the Wildcats first
goal of the season against East Carolina
on September Sth, accepted across from
junior and fellow mid-fielder Kate
McKnightand kicked the ball past MSU
goal keeper Jennifer Gordon. But
Stumpf wasn’t done yet. One minute
and 16 seconds later Stumpf powered a
“rocket shot”. past the keeper into the
corner of the goal. MSU responded a
few minutes later when #7 Sarah

Vosmeier accepted a crossing pass of

Sewanee punter Bart Pride to attempt a
punt out of his own endzone. Davidson
freshman Sam Fraundorf was able to
infiltrate the Tiger’s protection and got
a hand on Pride’s kick, deflecting it out
of the end zone for a safety.

The second quarter saw much of

the same, with neither team able to
sustain a scoring drive.
Sewanee received the ball first in the
second half, but were stifled again by
the Davidson defense. Thanks in part to
the continuing pressure by Davidson’s
special teams, Pride’s punt was shanked
out of bounds, and the Wildcats as-
sumed control of the ball at Sewanee’s
41. Three plays later, Tom Dugan con-
nected with Marcus McFadden for a
30-yard touchdown pass. Brian Lan-
gley tacked on an extra point to give the
‘Cats a9-O lead. The Tigers roared
back, though, answering with a touch-
down of their own on a 61-yard run
from scrimmage by Brian Morrison,
who racked up 172 yards on 30 carries
for the afternoon. A failed PAT, though,
proved to be a deciding factor in the
game.

A fourth quarter Wildcat fumble
on their own 20-yard line set upa4-yard

Sewanee field goal, tying the game at
nine a piece with 4:17 left to play in
regulation. The teams exchanged punts
for the duration of the fourth quarter.
Under NCAA rules, the overtime regu-
lation period is structured much that of
a Davidson flickerball game. After a
coin toss, each team assumes control of
the ball at the opponent’s 25-yard line
on an alternating basis until one team
emerges from around with the lead, and
in turn a victory. Sewanee won by the
coin toss, and elected to defend.
Davidson opened their first overtime
drive with a four-yard run by senior
running back Bryan Kern. A second
down 15-yard strike by Dugan to fresh-
man Mike Tarver brought the Cats down
to the Sewanee six. On first and goal,
Corey Crawford carried the ball into the
end zone, but the play was called back
on a holding penalty, pushing the ‘Cats

- back to the 11. Two plays later, Dugan

connected with Crawford for a 7-yard
touchdown, Crawford’s second of the
season inas many games. Langley added
the PAT, and Davidson assumed a 7-0
lead...forcing Sewanee into a must-
score situation.

Yet again, it was freshman Sam

Fraundorf who came through with a
crucial play for the Wildcats. On the
second play of the Tiger drive, Jon
Wieland fumbled the football, and
Fraundorf’s recovered it to end the game,
bringing Davidson their first victory of
the young season.
Senior quarterback Tom Dugan
handed in another impressive perfor-
mance, leading the ‘Cats offensive at-
tack with 124 yards passing and two
touchdowns. Eric Ferguson, a junior
running back led the ‘Cats on defense
with 37 yards, while senior Bryan Kern
added 26.
But the story on this beautiful Saturday
afternoon was the Wildcat defense.
Though Sewanee was able to accrue
259 yards on the ground, 10 of their 15
drives were contained to under 20 yards.
And just one week after Jacksonville
quarterback Gary Cooper passed for
over 200 yards against the ‘Cats,
Davidson held Sewanee quarterback
Max Fuller to 0 yards passing. Four
Wildcats had double-digit tackles—
Fraundorf, Brad Boland, Clif Henry,
and Bo Henderson. Wes Thornton, Free-
man Belser, and Andre Carelock each
contributed 9 tackles to the effort, and

DE Ben Spivey amassed 8 tackles on
the day. :

This stellar defensive effort surely
came as no surprise to Coach Tim Landis
and his staff. Back in August, Landis
predicted a much-improved defense for
the Wildcats: “We wanted to make some
changes personell-wise on defense. ..we
wanted to be more athletic over there
than we have in the past. We moved'a
couple of guys from the offense to the
defense, our philosophy being: When it
comes down to it, defense wins cham-
pionships.” The Coach also had high
words of praise for a certain up-and-
coming freshman, “Sam Fraundorf, who
plays the middle linebacker
position...should be a big contributor
to what we’re doing.” With a team-
high 11 tackles, a blocked punt for a
safety, and a game-sealing fumble re-
covery ina sudden-death overtime situ-
ation, Fraundorf is making Tim Landis
look less like an ordinary football coach
and more like Elijah.

The Wildcats will have their first
home game this Saturday, when they
will host Emory & Henry at 1:30 PMo
Richardson Field. ‘

soccer team earns first victory of season

her own, shooting the ball past Davidson
sophomore goal keeper Winnie
Corrigan.

Although Davidson only enjoyed
a slim one-goal margin and their oppo-
nents had over 45 minutes to close the
gap, the Wildcats never appeared threat-
ened or un-nerved. According to head
coach Kevin Hundley the outcome was
never really in doubt and with 13 anda
half minutes remaining in the first half
junior mid-fielder Leila Wormuth seized
the rebound from teammate Natalie
Cox’s shot and scored yet another Wild-
cat goal. The goal was Wormuth’s first
of the season and it gave Davidson a 3-
1 advantage heading into the second
half.

The second 45 minutes was not as
fast paced as the first half, but the Wild-
cats played within themselves and did
not surrender another MSU goal. And
to top off their solid performance junior
forward Ginny Dye, last year’s leader
in goal’s scored with four, scored her
first of-this season with eight minutes
remaining. Dye was assisted by fresh-

men duo Tricia Nativi and Carolyn’

Stumpf. '
Besides impressively garnering
their first win this season, the Wildcats
also demonstrated solid offensive play
absent in their five previous games. The
team’s four goals doubled their season
total up to that point. Individually, fresh-
man Carolyn Stumpf made her pres-
ence felt and undoubtedly secured her-
self as a key member of the Wildcat
offensive unit. The 5’9”’ freshman from
Virginia Beach, VA had seven shots on
goal and the team’s first two scores-
both within the first five minutes of the
game. Stumpf’s three goals this season
lead all scorers.

Coach Hundley was extremely
pleased with Stumpf’s play. “She did a
nice job,” Hundley said. “She had two

more great
- stuff

" ous shots on goal.

opportunities in the first five minutes...

We're happy she put the ball in the
goal.” .

Other offensive standouts included
another freshman, #23 Natalie Cox, who
led the Wildcats in shot attempts with
eight. Cox was also credited with the
assist to teammate Leila Wormuth’s
first-half goal. Also, junior Ginny Dye
showed the offensive ability which made
her last’s season’ s leader in goals scored
and runner up in overall points. Dye
attempted four shots and scored the
game’s final goal. Dye leads the Wild-
cats this season with 10 shots on goal.

Defensively, Davidson obviously
played well only surrendering one goal
early in the first half. Goal keeper
Winnie Corrigan started for the Wild-
cats and played the majority of the game.
Thanks to the defense’s ability to keep
MSU outof Davidson territory Corrigan,
a 5’6”’ sophomore from Delmar, NY,
enjoyeda fairly relaxing game. Corrigan
was only forced to save two shots com-
pared with the fifteen for the MSU
keeper.

MSU was the Wildcat’s first vic-
tim this season, but last Tuesday evening
Furman College came very close to
becoming Davidson’s first mark in the
win column. Furman, one of Davidson’s
key Southern Conference foes, narrowly
escaped with a 2-1 victory.

The game was scoreless through-
out the entire first half and for the first
seven minutes of the second. The teams
played a game of cat and mouse with
each side passing the ball back and forth
over mid-field and attempting numer-
Both teams had
first-half opportunities but each failed
to capitalize. Davidson put the pressure
on with 17 minutes left in the half but
could not get a shot off. And with 5:12
remaining #19 Amy Balsinger had an
opportunity to score ona direct kick but
missed wide left.

The second half opened. with a

feverish pace. Goal keeper Winnie
Corrigan, who took over for first-half
goalie Chesley Garrett, was forced to
make two difficult saves within the first
three minutes of play. Offensively, the
Wildcats had an excellent scoring
chance with 41:20 left when #5 Ginny
Dye narrowly missed a wide open net.
Two minutes later Furman took advan-
tage of a missed Davidson corner kick
and #11 Melissa Sutton ran nearly the
entire length of the field eventually kick-
ing the ball past Corrigan’ s diving arms.

Furman enjoyed their 1-0 lead for
the next 27 minutes until junior mid-
fielder Amy Balsinger powered a direct
kick into the lower left corner past
Furman keeper MelissaBarnes. The
score was knotted at 1-1 with slightly
over 10 minutes remaining in the con-
test.

The tie was short lived. Two min-
utes later Kaye Brownlee of Furman
skirted past the Davidson defense and

shot the ball over Corrigan’s head into
the upper right corner of the net.
Browlee’s goal was the difference in
the game as the Wildcats were unable to
answer and Furman escaped by a nar-
row 2 to | margin.

Although his team suffered a dis-
appointing loss, Hundley was not dis-
heartened by the defeat. ““We-knew they
were in the top three or four in the
conference,” Hundley said. “We fought
back well and competed well. It was a
learning experience for us. It’s just un-
fortunate we played them as early (in
the season) as we did.”

Currently the Wildcats stand at 1
and 5 overall and 0 and 2 in the South-
ern Conference. Upcoming games in-
clude Campbell College on Wednesday
at 7:30 pm, and conference matches
against Appalachian State on Friday
the 25th at 4 pm and the College of
Charleston on Sunday the 27that 12:30.
