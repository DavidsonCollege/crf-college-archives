Our glance at conference standings last week proved quite
Yatal as far as percentage of correct predictions goes, Per-
haps we should take the week-end of widespread upsets in the
conference as a warning against future devlings into the grid-
iron fates. A widespread rain Saturday accounts for some
discrepancies, but the upsets were not all due to atmospheric
Causes. °

Out of the overcast came the Duke-South Carolina score-
less tie, State’s 20-0 victory over Wake Forest, and most. sur-
prising of all, Citadel's 7-6 downing of V.M.I. Ranking with
the upsets was the UNC fray with Maryland which went for a
scoreless tie until the Tar Heels showed the old spark in the
final quarter. State used the same driving ground attack that
she showed the Wildeats at Memorial Stadium, and bogged
down the Wake running while the weather did the same for

Sm

their passing.

Citadel pulled herself from the Conference cellar by whip-
ping the Kaydets by an extra point. Observers say that. it
wasn’t the rain, that V.MI. played better ball against Citadel
than against the Red and Black, and that Citadel outplayed
them. All of which makes it laok rough for the ’Cats tomor-
row. Both teams’ scores were set up on breaks. V.M.I. inter-
cepted a pass and ran it back deep into Citadel territory.
Citade] blocked a kick and recovered it on their own eleven.

After Wildeat scout reports of the VM.L-Citadel game,
the ’Cats have been working overtime this week getting ready
for the Bulldogs. They will be mindful of last year’s 21-13 up-
set score Saturday and seeking to teach the impudent tin sol-
diers a lesson.
