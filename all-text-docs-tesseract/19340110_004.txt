Alumni Suggest Equal
Team For Homecoming

Duke and Carolina Have Been
Opponents of Wildcats in
Most Homecoming Tilts

DESIRE CHANCE.FOR WIN
V. M. I., Citadel, or William and

Mary Are on Home Sched-
ule for Next Year

That the Homecoming football game
should be played with some school of
approximately the same size and
strength as Davidson is the sentiment
that has been expressed by many mem-
bers of the Davidson Alumni Associa-
tion. Several of the former students
have written to college authorities
about this, and others have recom-
mended such an action in conversation
with members of the Athletic Council
of the college.

In the past it has heen the custom
to have either Duke or Carolina as
the Homecoming Day opponent. This
year it was Duke and last year the
Tar Heels furnished the opposition.

Those making the recommendation
suggest that it would be better for the
alumni to return to the campus on a
day when the Widlcats at least have
an equal chance of winning. Among
the schools suggested are The Citadel,
V. M. L, William and Mary, or Wash-
ington and Lee, all of which are near
the size and strength’ of Davidson.
The first three are on the schedule
for next year, and, could easily be
arranged for the Homecoming Day ex-
ercises, The University of North Car-
olina is the only other home game
which could be used as a Homecoming
game, and the objections above have
been made to playing that school.

A Raleigh alumnus, writing about
__the situation, says, “It seems to me it
would be better if for that particular
occasion Davidson met a team that
we had better chances of beating...
the idea of driving 300 miles to see
Davidson'take a beating does not par-
ticularly appeal to me.”

Captain Norton G. Pritchett, direc-
tor of athletics, is perfectly willing that
the Homecoming game be made some
other team besides Carolina and Duke.
He suggested The Citadel or V. M, I.
as being natural rivals of Davidson in
South Carolina and Virginfa, and in-
dicated that either contest could be
arranged as the Homecoming contest
for next year. Davidson has played
both of these teams for many years,
and the scores-have always been very
close. The Wildcats have the edge on
The Citadel in the number of games
won, but the Virginia Cadets have a
better record than the 'Cats.

A decision wjll be made by the
Alumni Council at its meeting during
Commencement as to which game shall
be the Homecoming contest.

Fifteen Boys Initiated
Into Hi-Y Organization

Under the general direction of Sam
Nickey, the Y. M. C. A. boys’ work
division has made two important steps
in the last week. Fifteen boys were
initiated into the Hi-Y in Huntersville,
January 8. This organization is in
charge of Geddie Munroe and Dick
Hayworth.

Because of the destruction of the-old
Louisiana Dormitory by the CWA, the
boys’ workshop will be moved to the
empty garage between the hotel and
the jail. This removal will be com=
pleted in a week or so, as several new
machines will be installed, with the as-
 sistatice of Sgt. B. R. Burton and Pro-
fessors W. N. Mebane and O. J. Thies.

. The need to get away from our “ tra-
ditional, classical, and mathematical
schools” of today, and to substitute a
more practical curriculum in our edu-
cational system was pointed out by
Professor George E. Carrothers of the
School of Education at the University
of Michigan, over the radio last Sun-
day night. ;

President George Thomas of the
University of Utah took from the uni-
versity’s Sparks Club, organization for
the study of economic and political the-
ories, its charter on the grounds that
it had no right under the charter to
make an official trip to Carbon County,
Utah, to study conditions in the coal
fields where there recently was a strike.

Detroit University has an enrollment
of 77 men and 3,543 women.

An interesting article recently ap-
peared in the Charlotte papers con-
cerning Robert Glasgow. It seems
that during a trip up from Atlanta on
the train, Mr. Glasgow was asked to
hold a baby by a woman with whom
he was sharing his seat. Mr, Glasgow
protested, but nevertheless, the baby
was deposited in his’ lap. Upon arriv-
ing in Charlotte he found that he still
held an undisputed possession of the
child. The young man became panic-
stricken and as the train stopped in
Charlotte, Mr, Glasgow unceremoni-
ously deposited the baby on the red
plush seat beside him, seized his trav-
eling bag and headed for the front of
the train on a dead run. Before the
train came to a complete stop, Mr.
Glasgow, with one last fearful look
over his shoulder, swung rapidly, to the
ground and lost himself in the station
crowd,
