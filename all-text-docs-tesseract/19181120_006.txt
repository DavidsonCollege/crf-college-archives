kill, of the non-S. A. TP. C., President
Wilson. ‘Vhe plan was acclaimed as a
good one as each company cheered its
colors lustily. “The meeting was then
adjourned for the canvass.

“To your tents, O Israel.” “The com-
panies withdrew to their respective quar
ters and the portentious battle developed.
Company A began with a vigorous
frontal attack and made some apparent
watins. But. shortly, Company B, after
brilliant maneuvering, threw her veteran
lines against the flanks of the surprised
foe. ‘The splendid work of Captain
Shield'’s forces, who reported a thousand
dollars in pledges, apeared on the scene
in the form of Blutcher. “The day, ap-
peared theirs. Already General “Diaz,”
emulating -his-noted grandsire of the days
of old Rome, had cried, “I came, | saw,
I conquered.”

But the victory was not to be so quick-
ly rendered. ‘The British in Company
C's forces were as usual slow in gaining
momentum, but then they came on with
the impetuosity and tenacity of Tenny-
son's famous Six Hundred:

“Cannons to the right of them,
Cannons to the left of them,
Cannons behind. them,”

onward Company C charged. Liberty
Bonds and month's wages were thrown
into the contest. ‘Vhe eye of the British
chieftain grew bold and flashed with
pride. ‘Their victory was complete, and
on Company C rested the honors of the
day.

The results were authenticated and
announced in chapel at noon on ‘Thurs-
day. It was found that Company C,
with 72 subscribers, had pledged $2,
063. or $28.75 percapita. The others
had pledged as follows: Company B.
with 76 subscribers, $1,664.77: Com-
pany A, with 72 subscribers, $1,516.00:
Company D, with 57 subscribers, $1.-
148.23: and the non-S. A. ‘TP. C. stu-
dents, with 47 subscriptions, $787.50.
These totaled $7,179.50. or $22.20 per-
capita, giving Davidson the Jead per-
capita among: North Carolina colleges.
There was one subscription of $100.
Several contributed amounts. exceeding
$50. But the rank and file were from
$20 to $30. The campaign was an ex-
ceedingly enthusiastic onc, and were Sir
Edward Creasy still living he might re-
count Wednesday night's events as the
world’s sixteenth decisive battle.

BLUFF!

Why do the giddiest signhoards
Hang on the stupidest places?

Why does abysmal heart-sadness
Lurk behind smilingest faces?

Why does the gaudiest cover
Compass the prosiest book ?

Why does the frothiest frosting
Cover the crime of the cook?

Why does the great game of bluffing
Camouflage life far and wide?

God knows whether anything ever
Will be what is looks like outside.
