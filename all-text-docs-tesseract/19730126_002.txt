C. Shaw Smith, Director of
the Union, has caused mixed
reactions among students and
administration as to the
feasibility of his proposals for a
new union.

Basically these proposals
consisted of a listing of what
Smith thought would be
necessary or desirable in a
union. A figure of 102,000 was
set as the total square footage.

Vice President of Academic
Affairs John Bevan said that
he was “overcome by the
magnitude of the projected new
building. But."’ he added, ‘‘I
recognize this as a tactic of put-
ting in everything he could
think of. Now it's a matter of
how to tailor it down.

It's easier to have all the
proposals before you and to
take away than to have to add.”
As for the actual size, ‘It's not
going to be that big.’ Bevan
Stated.

**A decision is going to have to
be made, before long, as to
whether the union will be in a
new building or a renovated old

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Contributing Editor

In an effort to reach a
decision on the proposed Fresh-
man Symposium the
Educational Policy Committee
(EPC) will meet in a special
session Wednesday night to
provide sufficient time for
discussion.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs, John Bevan said ad-
ditional meetings will be held
until a conclusion regarding the
proposal is reached.

Bevan explained that the ad-
ditional meetings were
necessary because ‘‘other mat-
ters take up so much of the time

however infer that he expects
the EPC on the proposal to the
faculty in April.

If a symposium is to be a
reality by next fall the faculty
must approve some form of the
proposal by then, Bevan said.

Though discussion of the sym-
posium proposal is still in the
formative stages, Bevan in-
dicated that he expects the EPC
to endorse either a modified
version of the proposal or to ad-
vance an alternative for con-
sideration to the faculty.

“The EPC is looking at the
total perspective,’ he said.

Reaction among faculty to the
proposal was mixed this week.

proposal outright, others gave
reserved approval.

Bevan is supporting the
proposal because he believes
the usual freshman curriculum
does not force questions. ‘‘It
will be important for the sym-
posium to confront the student
with ideas he had previously not
been exposed to,"’ Bevan said.

But some faculty members
are not sure that the benefits of
the program would justify its

expense

“I'm not completely con-
vinced of the program's
educational value vet.’ said

professor of history Brown Pat-
terson.

Dan Rhodes. professor of
religion, questioned whether
the same objective could be ob-
tained) in another way
However. Rhodes added that he
is “generally sympathetic’ to
the proposal

Many of the taculty members
Who voiced their support for the
concept advanced in- the
proposal expressed doubts that
the program could) be suc
cesstully implemented. One
chiet concern involved the ad
ditional course load which could
be imposed upon participating
faculty members. and the fear
that some departments would
be left shorthanded.

Bevan said he felt the basic
concept of asymposium should
be either approved or disap-
proved, and that such details
could be worked out later.

Many of the faculty also
questioned whether the sym-
posium should be mandatory on
the faculty. The proposal
vresently specifies that all
faculty would participate
during the course of several
years.

The consensus of many was
that the best interests of the
student may not be served in

forcing taculty to teach the
symposium. “I see a danger in
forcing the faculty — into

something they don't want to
do,” said Rhodes

Reaction amony students to
the proposal was generally

building. namely the old
library. But first we have to ap-
praise the old building in terms
of adaptability through
renovation," Bevan com-
mented.

Asked if the administration
had been pressuring Smith to
complete the proposals, Bevan
noted, ‘We've been at his heels
to produce something to find
what he was aspiring to.

“Now a decision is going to
have to be made in lots of terms,

not only the size of the
building and the cost of the
building. but also the

probability of raising money for
whatever we decide.’ he con-
tinued.

“We've got to decide among
priorities in terms of student
needs and campus needs.”

He added that decisions
regarding the location and
facilities in a new union would
be reached by this spring.

Bob Edmunds, chairman ot
the SGA union-social life com-
mittee said that the committee
met with Smith last Friday and
talked about his __ basic
proposals.

According to Edmunds, what
needs to be determined now is
“what things are absolutely
necessary and what we really
need to have in a new union.
Whether Smith has proposed
the optimum, ideal union, |
don’t know. He's attempted to
put all the possibilities in front of
people. These things we could
have, now what do we want?

‘The Senate will now look at
these proposals.... try to pare
down what is in them..., and
discuss what needs to be in a
new union.” Edmunds _con-
tinued. ‘Personally, I think new
dorms and off campus housing
for married students should be
priorities ahead of a new
union.”

Edmunds also related that
‘how they handle this is one of
the major decisions on campus.
The choice of the location of a
new union should be made with
extreme care. The placement of
a new union will affect the
growth of the entire campus.
They should take time and not
hurry their decision."

Gray Robinson, a sophomore
who ran for President of the stu-
dent Union, did not like Smith's
proposals. ‘‘He's proposing
everything first and working
down from there. He should
start with a base and work up.
What he should consider is what
the students basically need and
plan for something like that.”

Robinson stressed that a
union is ‘‘one central place to go
and have fun. The existing
union doesn't fulfill the needs of
the students because there is
nothing there for the students to
do. They can plan for it but I
can't realistically see a new
union in the next five years.
Therefore, something should be
done about the existing union."

As for the facilities offered at
a union, Robinson said, ‘‘we
definitely need a bookstore, we
have to have a cafeteria, and we
need a place to show films and
dance.”

Mike Pappas, SGA senator
from the freshman class and
member of the ad hoc com-
mittee studying Smith's recom-
mendations, remarked that
“the committee is faced with
the responsibility of coming up
with feasible estimates of
facilities that could be in a new
union. Definite proposals will be
ready by mid-March.”

Mitch Purvis, junior SGA
senator, said of Smith's plans
that ‘‘in going for as much as he
can, I hope it doesn't scare
others concerned into not
thinking about other priorities.
The top priority is student
housing. | hope that in over-
shooting for a union, other
academic facilities are not
cut.”

Calendar Debate

Continues In Senate

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

The debate over Davidson s
academe calendar is still a big
issue as the current SGA ad
ministration comes toa close

Ina report in Tuesday mght’s
meeting on the Educational
Policy Committee (EPC) by
Doug Brown. it was disclosed
that members of the faculty are
receptive to a revised calendar,
although most of them have not
seen the one proposed by the
SGA.

However, John M. Bevan,
vice president for academic af-

_ fairs and chairman of the EPC,

is, said Brown, “sticking to his
guns’ on the calendar issue
because he thinks there is “no
educational reason to change
it.

When asked for his comment
on the statements, Bevan
charged that they were “com-
pletely erroneous’ and added
that he intended to “stand by
the decisions of the Executive
Committee

“The Executive Committee is
charged by the faculty for the
purpose of handling the calen
dar question,” said Bevan.
“and the EPC only makes
recommendations to it”
