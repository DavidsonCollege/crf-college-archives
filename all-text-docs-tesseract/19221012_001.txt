CHAUTAUQUA ENTERTAINERS
MAKE ANNUAL APPEARANCE

Students and Townspeople Fur-
nished Educational Entertain-
ment

The Redpath Chautauqua opened its
local three-day program Friday after-
noon, in the special tent provided on
the vacant lot in front of the postoffice.
The Chautauqua was brought to Da-
vidson largely through the influence of
Dr, H. B. Arbuckle, chairman of the
local committee.

FRIDAY AFTERNOON

Every one, both young and old, who
was at the opening performance was
delightfully pleased with the presenta-
tions. From the beginning to the end-
ing of the performance the audience
eagerly awaited the development of the
program.

The performance began with a folk
dance by 12 small girls of Davidson,
under the direction of* the children’s
worker, dressed in red, white and blue
dresses. ‘They carried out a patriotic
program, Uncle Sam, Miss Columbia
and Liberty were the central figures.

The Clifford Collins Company ren-
dered a splendid musical program. In
this company are two exceptionally
gifted musi¢ians. Their musical pro-
gram and the characterization of the
modern hick were met with enthu-
siasm. The Collins. Company, com-
posed of Mr. Clifford\Celtins and his
wife, perform under the.name of the
Collins Dual.

' Following the program presented by

these capable artists, Milburn, the
magician, proved himself to be a
sleight-of-hand artist of no mean

ability, The manner in which he made
the coins and the handkerchiefs vanish,
and his Spirit Box are still puzzling
those who watched him perform his
marvels... His greatest card, however,
was the writing on the slate which was
not touched by human hands during
the whole operation.

Acfitting climax was added to the
program in the lecture—Making Your
Dreams Come True—by Dr. W. T. S.

DAVIDSON CAMPAIGN MEETS
WITH ENCOURAGING SUCCESS

Finances for Rebuilding Cham-
bers Being Pledged Rapidly

In an interview with Mr. Malcolm
Lockhart, director of: the Davidson
College compaign, he seemed very
much pleased with the outlook and
which the campaign
making, and has already made. <A
characteristic remark of Mr. Lockhart
was: ‘The spirit of the campaign is
unusually fine.”’

By October 15,  subsubscriptions
mnounting to $100,000 will be in hand,
it is expected. The campaign has
been practically completed in the Fay-
etteville. and Concord Presbyteries
with remarkable results. Rally meet-
ings have been held in Orange Presby-
tery preparatory to setting up the cam-
paign there. Campaigns for the other
four Presbyteries Will be started soon
with a period of two, weeks between
each,

The Charlotte campaign for $100,-
J00 will be carried on the week of
November 6-18. The college campaign
will begin at an early date. Mr. Lock-
hart is delighted with the Wildcat
spirit and after going through Georgia
lech, the University of Georgia and
Agnes Scott, he is especially optimis-
tic.

A feature of the campaign has been
the part taken by the college quartette.
It has been a great help in the rally
meetings. Last Sunday the quartette
was in Greensboro and sang at a num-
ber of meetings. It has been of much
service to the campaigners.

the powerful Golden ‘Tornado to a 19-

warriors took the field with the grim
determination to stay in there and fight

Red Laird, playing in his home town
featured the Davidson offensive. [He
was in on every play and his punting
pulled the Wildcats out of many tight
holes. He averaged close to 40 yards
on his punts. Spratt Moore played-his

time he got his man when a miss meant

be given to the line which held so well.
Sam Summers, at guard, bore the
brunt of two plays on the one-yard line

As the Wildeats plunged into battle
on Grant Field Saturday afternoon
wer half the Davidson College student
hody assembled around a large black-
hoard nailed to the cast side of the Da-
vidson depot, The street* was filled
with the enthusiastic mob surging to
and fro in hopeful anticipation of the
first kick-off. Through eyes of wire
they were to watch the progress of the
game 500 miles away.

A great silence fell on them as Gal-
loway rose on the express wagon with
the first dispatch, ‘Tech was headed
toward the Davidson goal. Then dis-
patches poured in, As fast as tele-
grams were sent, Mauze diagramed
each play. The blackboard developed
into a saw-tooth diagram of end runs
and drives. Occasionally ‘Tech was
thrown for a loss and the people of
Davidson were: disturbed by the shout
that rent the air. More frequently,
however, the steady gains by ‘Tech
occasioned sighs and groans, wrung
from the lips of the far-away: specta-
tors. One, two, three touchdowns
sped over the wires and the ordor of
the crowd was dampened. But touch-
downs require time and before a
fourth could be made the first half was
ended.

As in the grandstand, speculation,
eats and cold drinks were in order and
the assembly dispersed to assemble
again at the beginning of the last half.

Slowly and steadily Tech advanced
toward the Wildcats’ goal. In the
shadow of their goal post, the Wildcats
held them for downs. The crowd
