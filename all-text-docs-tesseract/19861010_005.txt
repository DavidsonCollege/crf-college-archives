Old story line makes good in “Gallipoli”

By MARK CHEN

“Gallipoli” is an old story that
has been told many times. Young
boys grow up, see the army re-
cruitment posters, and sign up for
the war. They go off, have a good
time in boot camp, and then are
sent to the front. They do not like
what they see, but they do not get

to see it for very long after they get ©

the order to go “over the top.”
“Gallipoli” adds very little that is
new to this plot, yet it keeps the
moviegoer watching. The plot
may be old, but it is still worth-
while to watch the tragedy played
out again.

Perhaps the most horrible yet
fascinating aspect of this movie is
watching happy and decent people
go into oblivion. The movie is like
an accident unfolding in slow mo-

‘tion. The first frame shows a run-
ner getting ready to sprint. An old
‘man is coaching him and chécking
his time.’ The young man is
Archy, played by Mark Lee. He is
eighteen years old and training for

a race in town. His life has been
spent in the Australian outback
working on his father’s ranch. He
wins the race but this glory is not
enough when a military parade
marches by. So without the bles-
sings of dear papa, Archy runs off
to join the army. The year is 1915
and this army is going off to fight
the Turks. Frank Dunne, played
by Mel Gibson, is a cocky young
man who wants no part of a war.
He is also down on his luck and
without cash, so Frank and Archy
team up for a trek through the des-
erts. Frank ends up joining any-
way in order to impress the ladies.
They are then sent off to boot
camp in Egypt. There the war be-
comes one glorious holiday in a
foreign land. They enjoy the
camaraderie, the rivalry of regi-
ment versus regiment, and the un-
holy joy of being on their own
without many restraints. Boot
camp is a lot like the fraternity
scene. They shoot, march, and go
through “battle maneuvers” which
do not seem too bad. The war is

just a pleasant outing.

But all holidays must come to
an end, and the army is sent off to
war. Frank and Archy are landed
at Gallipoli, a beach in Turkey. At
this site the British in World War I
tried to land and take the city of
Constantinople (or Istanbul).
Once this city had been taken,
Turkey would have been knocked
out of the war as a German ally.
The British would also be able to
send. war supplies to the be-
leaguered Russian army, thereby
ending the war. Such were the
grand strategic considerations for
Gallipoli, which were more than
Frank or Archy or any of their
comrades ever understand. They
see nothing but a huge mountain
of rock, on which the Turks are so
well dug in that no Australian sol-

dier ever sees a Turk. Life in the .

trenches is a little hard but beara-
ble. The army is not so much fun
now but still has its moments. At
least it does until the order to at-
tack comes.

The movie was directed by
Peter Weir, an Australian director
who has already made a name for
himself outside of his homeland.
He directs this movie in a quiet,
dreamy way. There are no graphic
scenes of battlefield violence or

heroics, so that the war itself.

comes on as an anticlimax. In-
stead his camera lingers over land-
scapes of great beauty, such as the
wastelands of Australia or the
mountain of fire and smoke at
Gallipoli. Human beings often ap-
pear small and helpless. There are
few tricks or sudden camera an-
gles in this movie, yet Weir has a
definite style which is quiet and
unassuming. This style builds and
gtows in impact up to the final
scene.

The cast itself ‘helps toward
the meaning of the movie. There
are no “grand” performances or
tragic monologues, no lengthy de-

' bates or angry cries. Instead each

of the actors performs a role of a
very normal and all. too human

person. Lee is convincing as the
naive yet eager recruit, who does |
not really understand the nature of
what he wants. The others in the
cast do well in their smaller roles.
Gibson has the most understated
yet most important role of all. He
has no special wisdom and deliv-
ers‘none, save that the war is not
for him. He plays the sane man in
this war, the one who does not
want to be shot at but is stuck any-
way. He is the strong man who is
rendered helpless by the war. Gib-
son does well in this role as a sym-
bol of all the ordinary people trap-
ped by circumstances.

“Gallipoli” has nothing new to
say but has much which needs to |
be heard. It is a quiet movie which
does not overwhelm the
moviegoer, but haunts him or her
after the last frame is done. That
haunting moment is the final_pur-
pose of this movie on war. “Gal-
lipoli” will be shown on Saturday
at 8 p.m. in Love Auditorium.
