policy of the Chapel Study Com-
mittee, which reaffirms the objec-
tive of the mid-morning chapel
service to be primarily one of wor-
ship.

It is also felt that this exercise
is “an integral and valuable part
of Davidson College life” and that
certain additional objectives should
be served as well: education for
social responsibility, provision for
cultural and additional religious
opportunities, creation of a college
community, fostering of college
spirit, and expediting of campus
mechanics.

In accordance with this strength-
ened policy, a renovated schedule
for chapel services has been af-
‘fected. Limitation of the number
of exercises to three each week
is included in plans for next year’s
program.

These services will be held Tues-
day, Thursday, and Friday; chapel
on Wednesday will be conducted
only during special series, e.g.,
Fall Services and Otts Lectures.

Thursday bas been established
as Convocation Day when ordinari-
ly a specially arranged program
will present members of faculty,
administration, student organiza-
tions, or guest speakers and enter-
tainers.

An additional spirit of worship
apd dignity will be added to the
Friday exercise, but -incluston of
student announcements will also
be arranged.

A reduction in number of cuts
allowed in chapel accompanies the
elimination of Wednesday chapel.
Dean Spencer has announced that
a system of cut allowances has
been proportioned in the same
ratio as ~was formerly the case.
Seniors and juniors will receive
eight cuts; sophomores and fresh-
men, five, per semester.

The Chapel Committee will meet
regularly to plan programs; the
schedule and nature of exercises
will hereafter be announced well
in advance in a college bulletin
which will have a campus-wide dis-
tribution.

First “Open” Meeting

By JOHN TRASK, JR.

The first meeting of the newly elected Student Council
was held as scheduled in the Blue Room of the College Union

itrip per person.

on Wednesday night.

The “open meeting” was called to order by President
Perrin Anderson, and in keeping with his campaign pledge,
the meeting was open to all interested persons.

President Anderson called for a
breaking with precedent, and an-
nounced that the meetings will be
henceforth run “in a parliamen-
tary manner.”

The first order of business was
the election of a summer school
Student Government. Clyde Rob-
inson, a member of the Council,
was unanimously elected President
of the Council for the summer
session. Ten other students, who
will attend summer school, were
elected to serve on the Council.

Next, Hobby Cobb was elected
Judge of the Court of Control.
President Anderson voiced the
opinion that he felt that the Court
could and should be an effective
and helpful body.

Ed Speir was elected Recorder
of the Court. Two members fram
each of the three rising classes
were elected to serve on the Court.
These were: Harley Smith and
Dick Adams; Tom Newton and Bill
Gramley; and David Fagg and Bill
Price.

Anderson then said that he felt
that more “concrete steps” should
be made toward making known
the Council’s and the student's
views on the subsidization pro-
gram.

After much discussion on the
sending of delegates to the NSA
Conferences on student govern-
ment thjs summer, it was finally
decided that Councilmen John ‘Me-
Laughlin and Clyde Robinson
would represent Davidson College
at the August Conference.

* The financial cost for sending
the two delegates will be about
$150.00 plus transportation which
was estimated at $100.00 round

Athletes turn out in full force.

Davis, Rowland
Take Top Honors

Monday night at the annual Davidson College athletic
hanquet, Dickie Davis and Bill Rowland won top honors.

Davis, who was the captain of this year’s football team,
received the Ed Armfield blocking trophy as a result of his

fine play throughout the

As evidence of his scholastic
ability, he received the George M.
King award for the senior football
player with the highest academic
average; and an award from the
American Encyclopedia as a mem-
ber of the All-Southern scholastic
football team.

Rowland was the recipient of the
award for the outstanding athlete
of the year fm all sports. His play
in football and baseball earned him
the Tommy Peters award, given in
honor of the former Davidson star
killed in World War I.

By scoring 107 points in 7 meets,
Phil Koonce won the William J.
Murchen trophy for high point

number of points went to Al Or-
mond, and the Elgin White award
to the best senior golfer went to
Al Gaither.

Davis was not the only athlete
to receive recognition for ex-
cellence in scholarship. Don Mc-
Cree received the C. T. Stowe
memorial academic scholarship.

At the banquet there were both
“old veterans” and newcomers.
Winding up his athletic career at
Davidson, Ish Bennett was recog-
nized as the senior winning the
most letters. He took 4 in base-
ball, 4 in basketball.

David Fagg, starting his career
as a Davidson football player and
wrestler, won the Cobb award as

will be at the University of Min-
nesota.

The meeting continued with An-
derson’s request that the council-
men learn and familiarize them-
seives with the new Constitution.

President Anderson then stated
that the policy on the method of
the meetings would be that the
Council would hold “open” meet-
ings on all legislative ond policy-
making matters, but that in the
case of “judicial” matters, the
meetings would naturally be
closed.

There was some discussion about
the “open” and “closed” meetings.
Councilman Car) Cooper was in-
sistent that ‘all meetings be open,
except in the trial of an honor
violation.” He was generally sup-
ported by the other members of
the Council, including President
Anderson.

There were, however, one or two
councilmen who expressed some
misgivings about the practicability
and wisdom of such “open” meet-
ings. These felt that there would
be a conflict between what was
purely legislative and what was
purely judicial.

President Anderson cleared the
matter up, however, by stating to
this reporter, that a clear line will
be drawn between legislative and
judicial matters, and that each will
be handled separately with the
best interest of the student in
mind.

Seniors Beal Facully
By Winning Three
Out of Four Events

The annual “Senior vs. Faculty
Games” were held on Tuesday and
Wednesday of this week. Despite

their youth, the seniors of David-:

son College took three of the four
events.

In ‘tennis, the featured match
was between Dr. Andy Paton and
Corky Clark. Here experience
helped, but the senior managed
to win the over-all match.

Bob Stevenson pitched the
Seniors to a whopping victory over
the Faculty in softball. After
three. innings, the score board
“broke,” so there was no way
to tell just how high the score
ran.

The beautiful golf links of
Mooresville, however, were the
scene of a Faculty victory. The
Seniors were badly beaten with
the Faculty posting on impressive
score.

In volleyball, the results were

reversed, with the Seniors winning
easily.
. At Erwin Lodge on Wednesday
night, the two groups enjoyed a
fish fry, highlighted by entertain-
ment by the “Candlesnuffers.”

Chamber Music Guild

college Chamber Music Guild con-

ning, May 20, at 8:15 P.M. in the

Chosen For Membership

By CLAGETT TAYLOR

The Delta Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa selected twelve
outstanding leaders from the student body, faculty, and busi-
ness world for membership in chapel ceremonies Tuesday
morning. Leighton McCutchen, president of the Davidson
chapter, presided over the annual spring’ tapping service.

The guest speaker for the oc-
easion was Dr. Charles Gottshall
Reigner, president of the H. M.
Rowe Publishing Co. of Baltimore.
Dr. Reigner spoke on leaders he
has known and the role of leaders
in the world today. He presented
a formula for getting things done
which could be well applied by in-
dustry’s biggest executives down
to the struggling student.

Following Dr. Reigner’s address,
two seniors, Fred Summers and
Vereen Bell, and seven juniors,
Perrin Anderson, Blake Brinker.
hoff, Hobby Cobb, Joe Conarroe,
DeWitt Helm, Jason McManus, and
Dick Morehead were tapped by
members of the society.

Dean Pietenpol of the faculty,
Mr. James Lore of Davidson, and
Dr. Reigner were also tapped.

The spring initiation banquet
honoring the new members was
held in the Ballroom of the Col-
lege Union Tuesday night.

FRED SUMMERS

Fred Summers, renown actor of
the Davidson stage, is a Pika from
Statesville. Though probably
known best for his roles in the
productions of the Red and Black
Masquers for the past four years,

Monthly membership meetings
are also planned. These well-bal-
anced programs will feature films,
recreation, and speakers along
with business sessions. These meet-
ings will afford the reality of a
“fellowship with Christ” for YMCA
‘members.

Membership Chairman Hampton
Mauze has already begun work on
membership campaign plans for
next year. Incoming freshmen will
be given an opportunity to join
during Orientation Week in early
September. The’ drive for mem-
bers of the student body will be
conducted from September 27th
to September 29th.

Concurrent with these new plans
is the establishment of several new
cabinet posts. The Service post,
held by Jerry Helms, will provide
ushers for Vesper Services and
will also sponsor projects such as
book exchanges as a service to
students.

A Commission on the Mission of

Student Poll Favors
Athletic Subsidization

A recent poll of the student
body on athletic subsidization, pre-
pared by ODK and administered
by the Davidsonian, showed a
large majority of students favoring
continued subsidization.

Almost 400 students were given
poll sheets, but only about half
this number returned the ques-
tionnaires; therefore, all results
stated below are based on approxi-
mately 200 students. ;

Question Number I was: Are you
in favor of a non-subsidized ath-
letic conference with such teams
as Centre, Sewanee, and South-
western? 16.7% of the students
answered in the affirmative, while

83.3% said no.

man’s media.. Men today  con-
sume little time listening to the
radio, but almost equal the amount
spent by women viewing television.
Both sexes chose the latter as the
most popular advertising media
and overwhelmingly agreed that
they preferred men to deliver com-
mercials.

The most popular radio person-
ality with those interviewed is
Grady Cole and the most popular
on television is Arthur Smith. Both
sexes prefer comedy programs on
radio and comptete drama on tele-
vision.

Dr. Bevan sald that one of the
most significant effects of tele-
vision, as pointed out by the study,
is the fact that people now spend
more time together as families
than formerly.

Although he goes to the movies
less, the average person still
spends about the same amount of
time reading newspapers and maga-
zines, and still visits his neighbors

just as often, he said.

According to Dr. Bevan, the boys
ran into many amusing situations.
When one woman was asked what
had influenced her to buy a tele.
vision set she replied that when
she and her husband had lived in
the country they had owned a set
and enjoyed it very much.

She was sorry: to say, however,
that when he had shot himself
the husband also shot their tele.
vision set and now that she was
living alone in the city, she felt
she just must have a new one.
