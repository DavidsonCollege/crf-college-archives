“We can’t get the formal rat-

about six weeks, but I'll stake
my life that it will be superior,”
Col. Adams proudly reported.

Col. Thomson, head of the
ROTC Department at the Uni-
versity of Tennessee, and his
assistant, Lt. Col. Hunter Mont-
gomery, were “highly compli-
mentary” of the local facilities,

termed all they saw as very
outstanding, Adams said.

The inspecting team was on
campus Monday and Tuesday.
They participated in the ofrmal
parade and inspection Tuesday
afternoon, which was threatened
by rain.

“We have had rain just  be-
fore or after every federal in.
“spection since I've been here,”
Major Robert Fleming com-
mented. “But every time we
have been lucky enough to get

through.”

The new radio club and radio
facilities drew the special praise
and interest of the inspectors.
They were also interested in,
and highly complimentary
about, the new one-semester
program for advanced cadets.

“Col. Thomson said he was

especially happy to visit Da-
vidson. He was commander at
Fort Bragg last summer, had
met Stan Gaines and other
Davidson boys there, and was
very impressed,” Adams ex-
plained.

Gaines, cadet .corps comman-
