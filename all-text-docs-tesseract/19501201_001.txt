SLUM CONDITIONS IN WHICH NEGROES
LIVE CAUSE DISEASE, UNSANITATION

By J. BRUCE FRYE

On December 7, 1941, the
United States entered a war against
the powers of the world that
threatened our welfare and our
very existence. A decade later, the
students of Davidson College find
“hemselves on the eve of a similar
situation, certainly not of the enor-
mity and critical importance of that
struggle, but one which. will call
for the all-out effort of the mem.
bers of the student body. During
chapel, on Thursday, December 7,
war will officially be declared on
the slum conditions of the Davidson
Negro community, in the form of
the YMCA Annual Christmas Gift
Fund, kick-off program.

These slum conditions have
been prevalent for years, breeding
disease, unsanitation, fire hazards,
and immorality, literally at the
backdoor of Davidson, The of-
fensive will be launched in two
theaters of operation.

The first uf these is Brady’s Alley,
located less than one hundred yards
off. Main Street.-

There are eleven houses in this

TREASURE HUNT

This year, for the first time in
the history of the college, the ath-
letic department is actually “scout-
ing’ the field for possible tennis
players, Last weekend the depart.
ment sent Head Tennis Coach, Der-
rick Barton, all the way to St. Louis,
Missouri, where the top junior
tennis players of the nation were
gathered for the: National Junior
and Boys Indoor Tennis Champ-
ionship Tournament.

For four days these young play-
ers competed for the championship
title, during which time Coach Bar.
ton carefully selected three pros-
pects from the better players. These
three men are now only seniors in
high school, and if they agree to
come to Davidson next year, they
will be eligible for the freshman
team’ only. The department is in
communication with them now, and
the decision as to whether or not
they attend Davidson next year is
up to the men themselves.

Davidson’s athletic department, in
connection with its program aimed
at developing the college’s intra.
mural and intercollegiate athletics,
has now set about the task of build-
ing a better tennis team. A good
team requires good players, and
unfortunately the team is missing
many of last year’s top men. Five
of the first six men on last year’s
team were graduated, but the coach-
ing staff is on the lookout for pros.
pective players.

area, all being fifty to sixty years
old, which house 87 people. Seven-
teen people live in one three-room
house, thirteen people live in one
four-room house, and twenty-five
people live in one five-room house,
as examples of the crowded con-
ditions.

There is no sewerage system,
other than an open ditch, in this
area, and outdoor toilets serve all
the inhabitants. The water comes
from outdoor spigots, which often-
times freeze up in cold weather.

The walls of these eleven houses
are papered with cight or nine
layers of newspaper to keep out
the cold air. Paper wrapped around
the flues to keep the heat in con-
stitutes a very terrible fire hazard
to the people of the community,
and to the business district, only a
few feet away.

The second area {s Shearer Town,
which was built some sixty years
ago by a former president of Da-
vidson College, It is just beyond
the town limit and over the county
line, on a dead-end, dirt road, and
hidden from public view.

Not as crowded as Brady’s Alley,
Shearer Town exhibits much the
same slum conditions, however.
There are ten houses located here,
occupied by thirty-five people. A
common spigot serves ail - these
people. It is located outdoors, and
on cold days, when it freezes up,
the people have to go over a hun-
dred yards, across ‘an open field,
railroad tracks, and a public high-
way, to Albert's Grill to get water.

Masquers Perform

Before Small Crowd

The first play of the 1950-51 sea-
sow whi¥ presented by the Red and
‘Black Masquers on Tuesday and
Wednesday, November 21st and
22nd, when they presesitted “Com-
mand Decision,” before two small
but very appreciative audiences.

The production of this serious
drama marks one of the first times
the Masquers have attempted any-
thing in such a serious vein. When
asked about the success of the play,
its director, Tad Currie, remarked,
“It was an artistic success but far
from a financial success, It looks
like we'll have to take it on tour to
clear the books.”

Plans are now underway, to take
the play to Winthrop College in
Rock Hill where last year “John
Loves Mary” was presented he-
fore an audience larger than that of
both Davidson performances. Ten-
tative dates were set for December

12th or 13th. '

From The President

To the Davidsonian:

The following items should be of interest “to the student body,

Within the past few days the first over-all drawings of the new
Student Union have been received.

The plans for this building are being drawn by Mr, Michael M.
Hare of New York City. Mr. Hare is the architect who has been re-
tained by the Student Union Association of Colleges and Universi-
ties of the country. He has participated in the designing of a large
number of new Unions and in the remodeling of others.

The plans as now submitted to Davidson are in semi-final form.
Alterations and changes can yet be made. The drawings will be in
the hands of Mr. John Lyles of the Y.M.C.A. for the next week
where they may ‘be seen by interested faculty members or student
groups. Study and suggestions from either group will be appreciated.

The physical survey of the Fraternity Court has been made in
recent days by a competent engineer. The plans are now in the hands
of the college's landscape architect, Mr. Charles F. Gillette, of Rich-

mond,

Aftér a brief period of study of these plans, Mr, Gillette will
come to Davidson for the purpose of conferring with several frater-
nities who have made application for the privilege of adding patios to

their present structures.

Davidson Professors| ‘Highly Pleased,’

Hold Offices At
Language Meeting

The cold and icy Thanksgiving
weather could not deter the spirits
of certain of the Davidson College
faculty members who headed Knox-

MOORE'S BATON BECKONS FROZEN BAND

By ALDEN WILLIAMS

Old Man Winter was the only
one not to answer the roll as the
Davidson College Band left for At-
lanta last Friday, but he was des.
tined to play, by his presence,
nevertheless, one of the biggest
parts in determining the actions of
that body for three days.

A clear, cold, average fall day
greeted the instrumentalists as they
left the Hill in two Trailways buses
after breakfast. Greenville: was their
first stop, and the South Carolina
city showed itself to be one of the
culinary meccas of the South as
sixty hungry boys gave those gar-
den spots of gustatory refinement,
the Sanitary Restaurant and Pete’s
No. 2 (Pete’s No. | and, for that
matter, Pete himself, being appar-
ently nonexistent), the best busi-
ness they'd had in months.

From then on until the middle of
the afternoon, it was still fall, but
at 3:30, winter came. Strange white
pellets filled the sky, and colorless,
frozen substance formed on the

windows. Confusion and bewilder-
ment reigned until at once, with a
shout, the Florida boys came to
the fore. “It must be snow!” they
yelled. Then, following the lead
of their Western North Carolina
brethren, who had heard in folk
tunes and family legends of such a
phenomenon, put on their coats,
saved for just such an event. Then,
feeling conspicuous without shoes,
they put them on, too, and broke
into that old favorite, “I'm Not
Trying To Set The World On Fire,
I Just Want To Light A Smoke
Pot In Your Orange Grove.”

As patches of snow appeared here
and there over the countryside.
reaching in’ places depths high in
the centimeters, one boy was heard
to gasp, “This is one of the worst
snows Georgia’s had in years, isn't
it?” When reminded that records
do show worse storms, he was
crestfallen, but kept his head out
of the window just. the same.

By the time Atlanta’s North Ful.
ton high school had been reached,
the cold had set in with a ven.

geance, and it was with quaking
hands and trembling ears that the
boys stepped on each other on their
way to the auditorium. Once there,
they met their weekend hosts, and
covered, by two's and Three's, the
whole of North Fulton County.
Friday night saw their first per-
formance, a concert in the Norgh
Fulton school. Here again, Old man
Winter threw his icy wrench into
the machine, as many alumni were
kept from the concert by the wea-
ther, But the attendance was good,
and the concert was accomplished
with a minimum of hitches. Re-
sponse to the program, which in.
cluded Vaughn Williams’ “Folk
Song Suite,” Morton Gould’s “Cow-
boy Rhapsody," and John Phillip
Sousa’s “Stars and Stripes Forever”
was spontaneous and enthusiastic. -
Saturday morning, several of the
boys were late for the appointed
meeting time, 11:30, and so a fit-
ting punishment was sought by the
Band's Executive committee. As
the temperature fell from four de-

grees to two, it was thought that]

five laps around the track in spats
and ties might do the trick, but
then, fearful of being accused of
lenience by the authorities, it was
decided that a brisk rehearsal of
the afternoon's proposed formation
would be more appropriate and ef-
fective.

At 12:30, the boys were carried
to the buses, thawed out on the
way downtown, and then froze
again as they depleted Atlanta of
its 1950-51 supply of earmuffs. No
accurate record can be secured co-
vering their activities until game
time, but it is known that one of
the more _ intellectually thirsty
freshmen found a rare bargain in
old books which was declared ‘“un-
believable” by all those who could
read. A few freshmen also had a
chance to glance over the trea.

Once out at Grant Field, the
band 1&ft the buses, claimed their
instruments, and took their places
in the stands. As usual, Director
Kenneth Moore raised his baton,

Mr. Jackson came to Davidson
in 1913 as the college's first full-time

operating deficit.

With ROTC Popguns

An old: fashioned turkey shoot
was held by the ROTC department
on Thanksgiving eve for the faculty
and their families. Over seventy
professors, ‘wives and children
crowded the ROTC building to join
in the fun.

Three main events were held.
A regular target shooting contest
headed the list, with a “Mystery
Bird” match being the most inter-
esting of the afternoon, The latter
contest, won by Professor Orange.
was mercly shooting at a large
paper turkey, the heart of which was
hidden. Professor McGavock won
the former event in the men's di-
vision, while Mrs. Heath Whittle
was the ladies’ champion. Both were
awarded live turkeys. A minor event
which all enjoyed was to shoot at
small metal turkeys for small priz-
es,
The children attending were en-
tertained with movies. A weapons
display was also open to the group.

FACULTY NOTES

Professors Cumming, Erwin, Ro-
berts, and Watts also attended the
planning session of the Southeast-
ern Region of Phi Beta Kappa, pre-
paring for the meeting of the
SAMLA at Davidson in November,
1951.

Dr. James Y. Causey served as
chairman of the nominating Com.
mittee of the Folklore Section of
the South Atlantic Modern Lan-
guage Association at its annual
meeting at the University of Ten-
nessee, November 24-25.

On Tuesday morning at the
‘chapel period, the Davidson
chapter of Phi Mu Alpha, hon-,
orary music fraternity, will
present a performance of Carlos
Menotti’s ‘‘The Telephone.’’
This work was given its first
reading at Davidson last spring
and ‘was so enthusiastically re-
ceived that there have been
numerous requests for a_ repeat
performance this year.

Menotti's “The Telephone’’ and
another of his works, “The Me-
dium” ran on Broadway for several
years. “The Consul,” Menotti’s lat-
est work, is now in production on
Broadway. “The Telephone” is a
modern one-act opera depicting the
plight of a young man’s attempt
to tell his sweetheart of his love
for her in competition with her
ever-ringing telephone. His solu-
tion to the problem highlights the
production,

The role of. Lucy will be sung
by Miss Roberta Jones, a junior
at Queens college, and that of Ben
by William Whitesides. The two
were also soloists in the Transyl-
vania Music Camp performance of
‘Beethoven's “Mass in C” last Aug.
ust. The performance is produced
by Alfred Neumann, president of
Phi Mu Alpha.
