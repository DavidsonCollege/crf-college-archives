Countdown For A Lost Weekend

Even if Spring Frolics should
turn out to be a smashing success
(assuming. of course, that there is a
Spring Frolics!), 1933-64 will certainly
have been the year that Davidson had
only two and one-half IFC Dance
Weekends. The proposed Mid-Winters
(and, at this date, it is still “propos-
ed!”} is just that meagre.

The thought of really letting-off
steam at Mid-Winters, usually a stay-
ing influence during Davidson's per-
iod of mourning—January exams, has
been replaced, for many, with spécu-
lations about where to go on February
7-9 to have his proverbial “blast.”
W & L’s “Fancy Dress” and ‘Ger-
mans’? at UNC appear to be the most
popular choices at this point, with
New York or a trip to the mountains
running close behind.

What is the fare for Mid-Winters?
Well, there is a top-flight basketball
game (with Georgia Southern?) in the
gym, after which the horde of excited
party-goers will (probably) dash head-
long to the Chambers banquet hall
(scene of the annual Parents’ Day
dinner. and similar social affairs) for
a combo-party (exactly which combo
will play is still unknown.). The really
big “thing” (and we use the vernacu-
lar intentionally) of the weekend is a
Saturday afternoon concert by Count
Basie. It is indeed fortunate that
Union-master C. Shaw Smith is some-

Issues, Part 2

If the YMCA’s first semester
Great Issues program wasn’t a scream-
ing success, it was at least a good idea.

The series on Africa suffered
primarily from topic choice and in-
articulate speakers, so in drawing up
a program for this semester, two
YMCA cabinet members have gone to
great pains to correct both shortcom-
ings in a continued effort. to bring
vital issues to Davidson.

Topics for the coming semester
include Secularization, Politics, Arts,
Sex, Psychiatry, and Problems of the
Inner City. and speakers are of the
proven caliber of Will Herberg.

On Tucsday, Feb. 4, the series
will be opened by a Dr. Scriven of the
University of Indiana, who will speak
on “The Non-Existence of God.” That
night he will engage in a discussion of
same with Dr. Earl MacCormac, pro-
fessor of philosophy here.

Such a discussion represents the

thing of a magician, or we would not
even have Count Basie.

The quality of this so-called ‘“en-
tertainment” is enough to drive the
weary Davidson Gentleman to seek
his kicks at Bob Jones University or
St. Andrews or some other equally
famous-for-parties institution. And
who could blame him?

The responsibility for this beau-
tiful example of ill-planning and lack
of intelligent action lies solely with
the IFC. For the past four months
this stellar group has operated with
the efficiency of a drunk playing pick-
up sticks. IFC meetings border on
mayhem, and this fact is a mere re-
flection of the character of the whole
program, or lack of program. as the
case may be. And, at a time when
fraternity systems in general are not
exactly held in the highest esteem in
academic communities, this kind of in-
efficiency cannot be tolerated by fra-
ternities’ advocates.

If the IFC cannot do its job, and
it is increasingly apparent that it can-
not—in matters other than social, as
well, then its authority should be
delegated to a group that can handle
the task—namely the Fraternity
Presidents’ Council. We would advo-
cate serious contemplation of such a
move—and soon!

THK

very thing we have requested at
length on several different occasions
—Davidson professors making educa-
tion literally come alive by entering
into discussions or debates with out-
siders who stand for controversial
points of view.

We still have fond memories of
what Dr. Patterson did (or didn't do)
to Fulton Lewis, U1], and of what Dr.
Goodykoontz definitely. did as he
stormed down the aisle that night in
Chambers Auditorium, not to mention
the time Dr. Rhodes and Co. took on
Leon Uris to the cheers and boos of

various partisan groups in the aud-
ience. '
The MacCormac-Scriven discus-.

sion should be less violent but. no less
interesting, and. in commending the
YMCA for their perseverance, we look
forward to more programs of this na-

ture.

Catholic: Anti-Catholic

Prejudice Exists Here

Dear Editor:

Religious bigotry exists at
Davidson College. As a Roman
Catholic and member of a very
small religious minority on
campus I feel somewhat quali-
fied to make this statement. In
the three and one-half years
that I have been at-Davidson I
have often been amazed and
shocked at the religious attitude
of the students. The dominant
Attitude of the students toward
their own religion seems to be
one of indifference and some-
times even hostility. Their at-
titude toward non-Protestant
Christianity, and particularly
Catholicism is, I have found,
intolerance and scorn.

Intelligent criticism is not. of
course, at all offensive. But the
criticism often heard here is
usually based on absurd miscon-
ceptions. More than once I have
had to explain that Papal in-
fallibility does not mean Papal
impeccability, that the Catholic
Church does not oppose scienti-
fic investigation. and even that
Catholic sermons are delivered
in the vernacular, not Latin.

Just recently I heard a stud-
ent remark that Mrs. John F.
Kennedy's religion would pre-
vent her being able to remarry.

worship John the Baptist or
Lutherans, Martin Luther, Pro-
testants would be shocked. Some
of the remarks I hear about
Catholicism are comparable to
this or worse!

What is really shocking is that
there appears to be very little
effort ‘made at Davidson to cor-
rect these misconceptions. In-
deed at times it appears as if
there is a deliberate effort on
the part of a very few to distort
the facts about the Catholic
Church.

For example, I remember
hearing once a professor relate
that there had once been a fe-
male Pope, and that her sexual
identity had become known
when she suddenly gave birth
to a child while in.a Papal pro-
cession. This story about a fe-
male Pope has not been held
by any reputable historian (Pro-
testant or otherwise). It is mere-
ly a fable—but it was presently
to our class seriously as a true
historical fact. And this is not
the only time that the facts
have been distorted or poor
taste displayed. Let me hasten
to add, however, that the over-
whelming majority of Davidson
professors are not guilty of this
sort of thing.

It seems strange too that Dav-

If I should say that Baptists idson College has shown no in-

terest in the current Catholic-
Protestant dialogue and the
Beumenical movement. At Har-
vard, Yale, Princeton end other
leading educational institutions
Catholic and Protestant scholars
have made real progrezs in
mutual understanding. Even
nearby Belmont Abbey College
contributed to the movement
for Christian unity by having as
a guest speaker Evangelist Billy
Graham.

But, as far as I know, David- c

son has never invited a Catholic
theologian to speak on campus.
Except in the Westminster Fel-
lowship there has never been
anything said about the Ecu-
mencal Council, which many
scholars have predicted will be
considered in the Jong view of
history one of the most import-
ant events of our century.

Surely, one would expect that
Davidson College, a Christian
institution, would participate in
the world-wide movement to re-
store Christian unity.

I do not expect a Presbyterian
college to grant the Catholic
Church special favors and con-
sideration. I do expect, however,
the proper amount of fairness,
decency and scholarly attention
which is worthy of an institution
such as Davidson seeks to be.

Ratliff Views Pakistan:
Poverty, Student Riots

Ed. Note: Dr. Ratliff, Professor of Economics at Davidson, is currently on leave to serve a three-y
Professor of Economics at Forman Christian College in Lahore, West Pakistan. In the following,

months in Lehore.

Having been hurtled to the other side of the world so rapidly, ‘ !
one else was awake and wide awake when they slept—and I really became wide awake the first night w

it took us a few days to become orient

the minaret issued forth a block away over the loudest public address system I’ve ever heard.

It is taking longer than a few
days to become adjusted to the
culture, the so-called cultural
shock being quite real. I think
it is indicated to some extent by
an incident that took place
shortly after we arrived. Mrs.
Ratliff and I were standing in
the dust of a village watching
the activity and she turned to
me and asked. “Are these people
really human beings?”

All the written descriptions
and piotures of underdeveloped
eccnom:ecs are inadequate in
conveying the situation to one—
he simply has to see. feel, ex-
perience and smell it.

It is too soon for me to be
drawing conclusions concerning
economic development pro-
blems. but I am becoming more
and more impressed with the
significance of the soc.o-cultural
factor in development. The way
the values and institutions here
seem to perpetuate economic
underdevelopment slaps you
right between the eyes. Econo-
mies such as this must develop
their natural resources and ac-
quire capital to develop, but
societal relationships therein
must undergo change, and the
last is probably the most diffi-

cult to achieve—certainly it’s
a slow process.

Persons seem to want posi-
tions but don’t want to assume
responsibility and work in them,
just as students definitely want
degrees but most definitely
don’t expect to work for them.
Last spring thoy staged a “walk
out’? because they considered
the examination questions to be
too difficult, and the University
is allowing them to take another
exam!

Speaking of student actions,
! have already experienced a
student riot. After the Vice
Chancellor of the University
expelled a “student” (he had
attended two classes in the
past year ... somewhat of a
professional student politician,
running for student offices
and attempting the examina-
tions each year), a group went
to his office, waved a bloody
handkerchief in his face, and
ransacked the place, demand-
ing that an ordinance giving
University officials power to
expel students be rescinded.

"This erupted into widespread

demonstrations, and the police
stepped in with tear gas, etc.

St. Anthony Goes To College . .

‘The Medical College students
reported in a mimeographed
statement three students (one
from F. C. College) killed, and
this really fanned the flame.
Wearing their black arm bands,
the students gathered for a
memorial service only to find
the “deceased” also in attend-
ance. A local newspaper that
carried accounts of the killings
was shut down by the govern-
ment, which accentuated the
unemployment problem. At any
rate. classes were suspended
and the students sent home for
two and a half weeks.

My duties are varied: teaching.
economic theory at Forman,
teeching general economics to
graduate students in Panjab
University’s Institute of Educa-
tion and Research, working on
library needs for M.A. courses
at Forman, and studying Urdu.
I find that the University’s So-
cial Science Research Centre
is doing some good work on the
economic and sociological as-
pects of the village, which is so
important in this underdevelop-
ed economy.

Teaching here is quite differ-
ent: in general, the undergrad-
uates’ level of preparation, at-

a Communication

titude toward study, motivation,
classroom attention, and honesty
in taking tests are disappoint-
ing. I am not sure what factors
are responsible, but I believe a
major one is the examination
system employed. in the country,

Fontunately, I do have a few
really good students, who seem
to be interested in learning
economics and not just the ma-
terial covered in the somewhat
out-of-date syllabus. Most of
them. however, share the atti-
tude of the one who came up
after class to ask. “Sir, that
diagram you uscd is not.in the
text, is it?” 1 answered. “No,
but it. illustrates material cov-
ered in the text.” His reply. as
the dismissed the diagram from
his mind and departed: “It's not
covered by the syllabus then.”

This is the first time Mrs.
Ratliff or I have ever studied a
foreign language “on the spot.”
It’s fun to try to speak Urdu
with Pakistanis—they delight
in our trying to use their lan-
guage and practically fall over
us helping us learn new words.
In many situations one is forced
to use whatever Urdu he can
command, which is undoubtedly
the way to learn to speak a
language.

One characteristic that I sup-
pose all North Americans notice
is the local concept of time. A
Pakistani will refer to days as
we refer to hours or even min-
utes. While in Karachi recently
to clear our baggage, I. was in-
formed by. a customs official,
“You'll receive the import per-
mit in five or six days,” as if
he were saying five or six min-
utes. There I was 800 miles
away from home and my work;

THE EDITOR

Communication
Falters: Ferris

Dear Editor:

The recent action of the
faculty on underachievement
has raised the dusty heads of
several old questions. Can any
tule or legal threat force a stud-
ent to improve his grades? Even
if grades improve due to the
tule, are they a proper indica:
tion of achievement?

How accurately are we
evaluating ovr students, for
instance, when we label the
winner of last year's Vereen
Beli. award for creativity an
“underachiever?”

Something is lacking in. our
educational system at Davidson.
is seldom es-
tablished between students and
faculty. Both students and facul-
ty have lately expressed a sin-
cere concern about our methods
of teaching. The younger faculty
members especially feel that
rules cannot force students to
change their study habits: that
the real problem lies partly. in
their own methods of teaching.
If their material is made inter.
esting students will take their
own énitiative in study.

One student said: that his so-
called “apathetic” fraternity
brothers are made so because of
the dry, uninteresting material
of the classroom. “I can’t be-
lieve some of my professors,”
he said. “They don’t seem hu-
man. If I knew them as person.,
T could get interested in the
matenial, but they feed us facts
like machines. Why should ]
believe in a course if they
don't?”

This lack of communication
between faculty and students

is a major problem of our
education here. | speak from
the student’s side of the
fence, but I'm sure the faculty
has the same impression of
us. Teaching class after class
of sleepy, apathetic students
must make a professor won-
der if-we have any spirit left
in our souls.

Our educational system is so
formalized that it has split us
into two groups—faculty and
students. You faculty come to
class in a coat and tie, deliver a
load of facts from a podium and
leave. We scribble our notes for
an hour and rush out the door
when the bell rings. This is no
education.

Our roles here are so regi.

mented that we have lost sight
of our ultimate purpose—the
pursuit of Truth. In light. of this
purpose we all stand as children.
You faculty serve as moral and
intellectual Jeaders because ‘you
have more experience and edu-
cation than we, but you are still
human beings with the same
frustrations and desires as your
Students. Why can’t we realize
our common purpose and open
ourselves to each other with a
deeper understanding than that
of a cold classroom lecture.

Our growth here should be
toward the "whole man.” We
cannot achieve this goal in a
étilted, chassroom atmosphere
that allows only superficial con-
tact between professors and:
Students.

An education is fruitless with-
out a depth contact between in ~
dividuals, We must speak to
each other as persons, not as
machines delivering or memor-
izing facts.

The quality of humility neces-
sary to establish this under-
Standing is sadly lacking at Dav-
idson. We lack the courage 10
question ourselves and admit
our weaknesses. It is time that
we as students and faculty stop
playing our classroom roles and
honestly seek the true purpose
of an education.

IFC Midwinters
Plans Draw Fire

Dear Editor:

Not since the IFC brought
Stan Reuben to the campus last
year have we experienced such
heights of boundless elation as
in the anticipation of the forth-
coming concert by Count Basie.
It warms our “hearts ¢o see the
compassion of hard-working
Haynes and his cohorts in al-
lowing an old colored man to
gain popularity with ‘the college
set. We are sure that this will be
an unforgettable weekend and
with-luck and Kelly’s ability to
draw top name stars perhaps
we will have a Saturday morn-
ing concert with Lawrence Welk
and a Sunday morning concert
with the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir at Spring Frolics.
