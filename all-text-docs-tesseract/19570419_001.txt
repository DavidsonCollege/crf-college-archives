Col. Sapp To Leave
For New Post

Dr. John R. Cunnmgham an-
nounced today that Lt. Col. John
D. Sapp has been transferred
from his assignment as Profes-
sor of Military Science and
Tactics at Davidson to duty in
Germany.

Col. Sapp has been the
PMS&T here for the last three
years. During his stay of duty,
the ROTC Department has
moved to new quarters in the
basement of Belk. The most im-
portant change that Sapp
brought about while he has
been here was in the handling
of administrative affairs.
Formerly the cadre exclusively
handled all of this, but under
Sapp’s charge the Department
has seen an extensive delega-
tion of authority to the individ-
ual cadets.

In announcing Sapp’s trans-
fer, Cunningham said, “We
have found Colonel Sapp a very
congenial and efficient PMS&T.
He has made a fine contribu-
tion to the college and the com-
munity.”

To replace Sapp will be Lt.
Col. William L. Adams, who
will visit Davidson the first
week in June.

Time Limif’ New
Masquers’ Play.

The Red and Black Masquers
will present “Time Limit!” by
Henry Denker and Ralph Ber-
key as part of the Tenth An-
nual Fine Arts Festival of Da-
vidson College.

The play will be given on
Monday and Tuesday evenings,
April 22 and 23, at 8:15 in
Chambers Auditorium.

“Time Limit!” is directed by
Prof. R. W. Tyson, and will see
such well known local actors
in the principal roles as Harold
Hall, Harry Paschall, Warner
Hall, George Kemmerer, Ray
Atkinson, and Hugh Craig. The
two feminine parts are being
performed by Miss Caro! Sher.
rill of Davidson, and Miss Bar-
bara Davis of Cornelius.

Others in a large cast are
Frank Norris, Ray Craig, Bruce
VanSant, Russell Ferrell, Bob
Hoagland, Warren Womble,
Larry Baggett. Henderson
Rourk, and Jim Owens.

The story of the play is that
of an American army major
who is about to be charged with
treason.

“Time Limit!” deals with one
of the many new problems that
has come out of the struggle
of the Free World in its ef-
forts to combat Communism.

and the Wildcat Handbook.

Inspectors Laud
ROTC Depariment

Federal inspectors praised
the Davidson R.O.T.C. Regi-
ment following their annual in-

‘|spection April 9.

No official overall rating will
be issued for several weeks,
but unofficial comments by the
inspectors indicate that the
rating will be extremely high.

The inspection lasted for two
days, April 8 and 9. During this
time the inspectors visited tte
classrooms, inspected the troops
on the drill field, and viewed
them in a regimental parade.

Cadets were tested on mili-
tary textbook knowledge,
knowledge of the weapons they
carry, and skill in drilling.

Col. J. D. Sapp, PMS&T of
the Davidson Regiment, said, “I
express my thanks to all Ca-
dets for their co-operation dur-
ing the inspection and I want
to thank especially the MS IV
Cadets for showing fine lead-
ership ability.”

Rumors Cleared On
Post Office Change

Rumors about the possibility
of the Post Office’s changing
quarters have been cleared.

The ten-year lease on the
present building extends
through January 31, 1958. Bids
are being received through May
3 from interested owners of
other loctaions.

It is reported that a new
lease could be contracted on the
present building.

EASTER:
Eternal Spring

By HARRY ANTRIM
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Easter is a time we all know by a mark on the
calendar. It has been a day so marked for almost two
thousand years and we accept it as something which
comes and goes with the regularity of Christmas, and
maybe we even pause and wonder a bit at its signifi-
cance and maybe we do not.

The pleasant prospect of

The relationship of the latter

enjoying a prosperous exist-|two are proven by the calendar

ence does not allow much time
for pausing and reflecting up-
on anything which does not
promise to bring some immedi-
ate return. It is difficult to
maintain a devoted outlook to-
wards the manifestations of re-
ligion amidst so much ease and
comfort as we er.joy.

Other people in other parts
of the world would not have so
hard a time in explaining their
rélation to an Easter or a
Christmas as we do.

LACK OF CONCERN

For all too many, the signifi-
cance of an Easter must seem
as the only hope in a very
black night. But the recogni-
tion of this fact serves only to
point up our own tack of con-
cern; we can write countless
pages about the black nights
of the thousands oppressed and
speculate for hours upon their
hopes, but for us it can be
little more than speculation.

We have never been op-
pressed and our only hope is
that the world will not touch us
until we have had time to live
out our secure lives.

So we will go to church this
Sunday and do our duty and
fulfill our obligation; for
church and Sunday and Easter
are inextricably linked togeth-
er in our inherited minds.

WON’T TRY TO NAME SUCCESSOR

. President May Appoint Dean

By WILLIE THOMPSON
Davidson Staff Reporter
At a_ regularly scheduled
news conference Tuesday after-
noon, Dr. John R. Cunningham,
President of Davidson College,
discussed a variety of topics.
Most of these questions cen-
tered about Dr. Cunningham's
resignation, his successor, and
the successor to Dr. Samuel R.

Spencer, Dean of Students.

THOUGHT OF RESIGNING

Dr. Cunningham was careful
to make it clear that his resig-
nation had‘ been prompted by
no sudden thought or action.
He explained that he had first
thought of resigning several
years ago, but changes in the
administration and new devel-
opments in the physical struc-
ture of the campus had neces-
sitated that he remain.

When the new job was of-
fered last October, the presi-
dent thought that college af-
fairs were on an even keel and
that he could resign without
causing undue strain on the
college.

NOMINATING COMMITTEE

The President expressed his
complete faith in the nomi-
nating committee. Dr. Cunning-
ham related what he knew of
the work which this committee

had already accomplished.

He explained that he had
asked the committee not to con-
tact him regarding his personal
choice in the matter, as he did
not want to name his own suc:
cessor. Dr. Cunningham said

that he had supplied the com- L

mittee with an extensive de-
scription of the job.

The nominating committee|; ~

has, requested by letter the
opinions of faculty, trustees,
members of the Board of Visit-

ors, in addition to asking for}...

student opinion.

he concluded,

iand the first named we attach
from habit. To us it is as simple
as that.

In New York they have an
Easter parade to add color to
the ritual. And all of this is
Easter to most of us; a simple
progression from ‘“bunny-rab-
bit” to cathedral, with a pinch
of prayer added to make us
feel better about the whole
thing.

NOT A DATE

But this is wrong. Easter, or
rather its meaning, cannot be
marked by a date or observed
through any ritual. It comes in
the Spring of the: year, but it
is an eternal Spring in itself
and there is a profound sym-
bolism to be found in the new
birth of life which occurs at
this time of year.

If the meaning of Easter is
the highest form of this new
birth and renewing of spirit
then it behooves us to pause
for a moment and consider. We
pause so seldom and consider
so little that surely it is not ex-
pecting to much that we inter-
rupt our feverish existence
twice a year and meditate.

St. Francis spent a lifetime
in meditation and we can mark
him down as a fool for so wast-

side the college.”
Cunningham

Dr. explained

This committee is still decid-| <2

ing the type of man desired for
the job rather than specific
personalities. For this reason
the President concluded, “I do
not expect the announcement
by the May 16th meeting of the
Board of Trustees.”
BIG MAN
Cunningham explained that
he hoped the eventual choice
would be “a big enough man
that he would have to be per-
suaded.”
“Do you think the new presi-

dent might come from the pres-| .

ent faculty?” he was asked. Dr.
Cunningham acknowledged that
“it is not beyond the realm of
possibility in the light of what
other colleges have done, but,”

Council Airs Views
On New President

By BOB LATHAN
In its final meeting of the year, the 1956-57 Student
Council, Monday night centered discussion around three
topics: vespers conduct, selection of a new President of
Davidson, and the rewording of a petition which was to
be voted on in chapel as ‘an amendment to the Student

Student Body President Dan|the evening of April 7. and had
LaFar pointed out that the fac-| regarded what happened on that
disappointed with|date as an “untimely, eruptive,
vespers conduct, particularly onjand unfortunate” situation.

WORST YEAR
Bill Martin, a spectator at
the meeting, was of the opinion
that vespers conduct this year
was the “worst” of his four

years in school and that some-|'

one “of authority was needed to
deplore in chapel such con-
duct.”

Following up the suggestion|‘

of another bystander, Phil Ku-
kura, a senior council member
Vernon Hunter moved that the
“Council work in conjunction
with the YMCA. and ask Dr.
Cunningham and/or Dr. Spen.-
cer to give a statement in cha-
pel as to the college's philoso-
phy of and reasons for compul-
sory vespers attendance and
exercises.” The motion carried,
and the Council also decided to
write a letter of apology right
away to the vespers preacher
on April 7.

After LaFar read the Coun-
cil a letter from Rev. Fred
Stair, secretary of the Trustees
presidential nominating com.
mittee, the Council began dis-
cussion on the important, sub-
ject of the Council's opinion as
to who or what the new college
President should be.

‘Class Presidents

John Bernhardt was elec-
tedl President of the Senior
Class in the run-off election
held last Friday. The presi-
dencies of the rising Junior
and Sophomore classes went
to Roy Gilbert and Dave
Robinson, respectively.

Other officers were chosen in
the run-offs. The senior class
vice-president will be Sonny
Ferguson with Roger Bates
serving as secretary-treasurer.

Tom Johnson was chosen
vice-president of the rising
junior class and Bill Ferguson,

Charlotte Phone
Promised Soon

“I have been told that Da-
vidson students may expect toll
free telephone service to Char-
lotte by July 1," Dan LaFar,
Student Body President said
Wednesday.

This service was to have been
available by April 1. The delay,
according to a letter received
from Southern Bell officials, is
due to-a three months' strike
at the plant which manufac-
tures equipment essential for
the Davidson installation.

There are to be two lines to
the college. One is for use by
staff members only; the other
will be used by the college of-
fices until they close, and then
will become available for stu-
dents. The extension for stu-
dent use will be located in the
Union and the college will pay
all expenses involved.

LaFar and Mr: D. Grier Mar-
tin. Davidson treasurer, are re-
sponsible for the work which
has been done on this subject.
It appears that such service for
the entire Davidson telephone
exchange will not be available
for several years.
