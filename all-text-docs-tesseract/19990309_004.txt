_THE DAVIDSONIAN

Pisces (February 18 - March 20)
You are physically flawless, Pisces, from your bub-
bly blue eyes to your toes which curl'so appealingly
in the sand. Beware of treadmills and Virgos who}
wish you harm. Make an effort to stop sitting alone
in your room making faces at yourself. Emphasis on
Brazilian Portuguese and the media.

Aries (March 21 - April 19)

Today is your day, Aries. Approach any member of|
the opposite sex and say, “I’m hot. You’re hot. I
want you and you want me, so let’s go, Baby.”
Watch out for that obligatory piece of toilet paper
that always seems to be stuck to your shoe because
this lessens your stock value.

Taurus (April 20 - May 19)

Be the Ball, Taurus. Emphasis on golf and tennis,
sushi, and lost legal documents. Don’t let your fun-
loving nature get in the way of serious and important
business. Take the bull by the horns but beware of
angry bees on the 6th.

Gemini (May 20-June 20)
Issues arise concerning any pets or credit cards in|
your possession. You will be held responsible for a

bors. Maintain creative control at all costs. Aquarius
plays a negative role. '

The remote and isolated Mystery, Alaska —
a little town on the outskirts of greatness — may
look cold and unexciting from the outside, but
inside, behind closed doors, Mystery has all the
sex scandals, hidden secrets, prying eyes and
poplitical hypocrisies of any urban den of iniquity.
And, it has a darn good hockey team. In a town
where everybody knows everybody else’s busi-
ness, ahuman interest story in a national magazine
suddenly thrusts the village into the world spot-
light. When the town’s amateur hockey team
accepts the challenge of a face-off against the New
York Rangers, the entire population must put petty
rivalries behind them and prove there is no mys-
tery to “Mystery, Alaska.”
