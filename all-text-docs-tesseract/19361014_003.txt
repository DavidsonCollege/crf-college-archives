“Sweepstakes” bring pleasure
to war veterans

From a veterans’ home in Legion, Texas,
anumber of entries allin the same hand-
writing come in each week. Of course
we checked up to make sure that the
entries conformed to the rules, and one
of the men explained: “Most of the boys
can’t get around—but I do and sol fll
out their cards for them.”

We're glad to say that the boys have
been pretty good pickers, too.

Have you entered yet? Have you won
your delicious Lucky ‘Strikes? Tune in
“Your Hit Parade’ — Wednesday and
Saturday evenings. Listen, judge, and
compare the tunes—then try Your
Lucky Strike “Sweepstakes.” And if
you're noralready smoking Luckies, buy
a pack today and try them, too. Maybe
you've been missing something. You'll
; appreciate the advantages of Luckies—a
