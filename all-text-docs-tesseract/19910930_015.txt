By Bruce Page

Justin Kuralt comes to the men’s basketball program from UNC-Chapel
Hill, where he received a BA in Geography in 1991. He is at Davidson as an
assistant to Head Coach Bob McKillop. At Carolina, Kuralt was the head
manager of the varsity basketball team for three years. He kept statistics and
supervised the varsity and JV managers.

Kuralt likes the switch from managing to coaching. He came outof college
wanting a Division I job and is pleased both with Davidson basketball and the

community here. He plans to focus his attention on one or two players and help
to mold them reach their potential.

varsity women’s soccer. Hundley graduated from Middlebury College, where he

) helped his soccer team toa 30-8-2 record over four years, including two udefeated

For the last 11 years, Hundley has been head coach of the men’s soccer team

atKent School, in Kent Conneticut. Hisrecord there was 101-61-29. Hundley says

he came to Davidson for the opportunity to coach full time and meet new
challenges.

running practices for head coach Betsy Pryor, who iscurrently on maternity leave.
Brown graduated from Earlham College, where she received MVP honors in both
field hockey and lacrosse.
