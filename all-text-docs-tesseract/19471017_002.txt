Age Of Enlightment

A gratifying sign of the times was the
University of Virginia’s attitude toward
j Chester Pierce, Harvard, ot 1949.
Pierce is a starting tackle on the Crimson
football team and he was one of the stars in
the Cambridge eleven’s loss last week to the
strong’ Virginia team, When this Harvard
tackle left the game in the fourth quarter,
battered and tired after playing his heart
out in a hopeless struggles, most. of the 24,000
persons present rose to their feet and cheered

Class

long and loud.

This incident, in itself, was nothing un-
usual, for it is customary that spectators at
football games impartially applaud coura-
geous or outstanding play by any man on
the field. Other footballers, perhaps, have
turned in better performances and before
larger crowds, but the roar that accompanied
‘Pierce off the field could well be termed,

*‘the shout heard ’round the South,’’ for
Chester Pierce is a Negro!
Pierce’s participation against the Vir-

ginians was probably much more significant
even than the appearance of Negro base-
baller Jackie Robinson with the Brooklyn
team last year. As in the latter case, it shat-
tered a precedent of long-standing, but this
particular one happened tobe an “‘unbreak-
able’? in our custom-dnd-rule-loving ‘South.
That South should be deeply grateful
to men like Athletic Director Norton
Pritchett and others of the University of
Virginia’s administration, who had enough
courage to smash a discriminatory law which
stated in unwritten and unamendable form
that Négroes were to do their football play+«
ing above the Mason-Dixon line if they were
to play against whites at all.

There are no previous accounts of Negroes
from the North being allowed to perform
against southern athletic teams in the South.
Accordingly, October the eleventh will be
marked down as a red-letter day in the ad-
vancement of race relations by all straight-
thinkers on the subjéct. Perhaps the day has
come when a true Southern recognition of
quality in any size, shape, or color can as-
sert. itself over the ranking of the minority
bigot. i

Scourge of the
Students .

Along the rough and rocky pathway of
education, which leads to Truth, lie the re-
mains of thousands who fell by the wayside;
victims of that dread disease.and bane to
Jearning—sackitis ! ;

is here used by English-speaking peoples for

the first time, it needs must have a brief
definition. Sackitis of
mind and character than of body; it is a
psychological escape mechanism; it is a re-
specter of no age nor group, but its worst
form appears among college students; it is
the killer of scholastie ambition; it’s unmis-
takable symptoms are: 1) a refusal of the,
patient each morning to his
‘sack’? until hunger or a paucity of class:
cuts drive him forth; 2) an uncontrollable
desire to retire before the evening shadows
are well-fallen; and 3) a marked propensity
for sinking abed between the last class each
day and suppertime.

Many of us find our double-deckers or
single-deckers constantly beckoning to us to
make use of them to escape the academic
and extra-curricular worries normal to the
life of every college man. We make count-

need a few hours of daylight sleeping, and,
if we’re honest, we’ll admit that our stan-
dard rationalizations are often little short

that we'll do better on that review tomor-

Letters to the
Editor...

| To the Editor:

Last Spring the Editor of THE DAVID-
SONTAN published an excellent editorial on
this page concerning the student conduct in
chapel. feeling that the editorial had little
effect, he asked that another, interested in
the condition, voice his opinions, in th hope
that presenting the situation to the students
again might produce some results. Hence our
comments: *

Twenty-five minutes in each day hag been
set aside for chapel’ exercises. The purpose
of this period is worship, but a portion of
the time has been allotted to student an-
nouncements and to student body meetings,
with Tuesday and Thursdays designated as
“student days.’’

The rowdiness of the daily exercise would
indicate that these few minutes a day were
devoted to voeal and physical exrcises, rather
than the worship of God, Certainly the ‘‘oop-
oops’’ and the ‘‘swishes’’ have their place
in the Davidson tradition, for they are in-
dicative of a unity, an esprit de corps which
is highly admirable. But at the same time
they are highly inconsistent with reverence.

The Davidsonian brings these thoughts to
the attention of the student body, not in
the hope that tradition, which is . healthy,
be done away with, but with a sincere de-
sire that it be confined to student days,
rather than disrupting the worshipful at-
mosphere.

By SAM ERVIN

By listening to the discussions
which inevitably follow the more
interesting and constructive chapel
talks, one can almost always pick
up some ‘excellent comments and
Stiggestions — regardless of the
topic involved. Last week was no
exception, Although Ernie Strick-
lin’s talk was unannounced and un-
heralded, it did not take long for
the student body to realize that he
had put his finger on one of Da-
vidson’s most pressing needs. va-
rious members of the faculty and
many campus leaders long
sought some way to provide more
social life for the men who do not
belong to fraternities and to build
up a feeling of fellowship among
them, Ernie’s talk reminded every-
one of this problem, and many sug-

have

gestions have already been offered.
have heard one of them repeated-
ly and I feel that it should be pass-
ed on for what it is worth.
Unfortunately, this is . not a
scheme which can be put into ef-
fect in the near future, In fact, it
would be well nigh impossible, in
this era of high costs to inaugurate
such a plan, It is something which
should considera-
tion, however, as soon as the col-
lege is able to resume its building
program, Therefore, I think that
it’s appropriate to mention it now.
If we are going to accomplish
what, Ernie and many others de-
sire, we are going to have to have

receive careful

a “student union.” A student union
is merely a building where the
campus characters can congregate,
participate in indoor sports, and
enjoy snacks. It's true that we have
facilities (very limited ones tho) of
this nature, but they are not under
the same roof and are widely scat-
tered over the campus (a two-story
Structure with a lounge and a soda
fountain on the first floor and a
large game room above plus per-
haps a couple of bowling alleys in
the basement), I honestly believe
that it would go far toward solving
our problem. It would give the stu-
dents a place to go at night and on
weekends — it would get them out
of their rooms and into “circula-”
tion” where they would be much
more likely to become well  ac-
quainted with their fellow students.
It_would slow down the mass in
gration to Charlotte and Moores-
ville—caused largely by a lack of
anything else to do.

As we've said before,

this is
strictly a long range proposition. I
do feel that those who are con-
cerned with such matters should,
however, study the possibility of
doing this. No matter how long it
takes to erect this building or
what the cost may be, it will pay
for itself in no time after its com-
increased
friendliness and unity among all

students.

GREEKS

.. BETA THETA PI.

The highlight of the week down
at the Beta House was downing
the SAE’s in touch football Thurs-
day afternoon. There was a large
turnout for the game in spite of the
driwating rain which persisted dur-
ing the game.

The biggest news flash to date is:
Lover Boy Turner's date of last
week-end is reported to have gone
to sleep.on the golf course after
the state game. What we want to
know is “How did Groves know?
Was he there, too?”

There was a large number of
Betas at the Wofford game this
week-end, but I’m afraid most of
them were stag. Among the more
notorious were “Weasel” Adams,
“B. B. Eyes” Upchurch, and “Bar-
rel” Shepperson, “Doc” Fulton
made a fo} e selling programs
and then threw a big party. for
his buddies at Gunder's
house. (Gray's food, of course).:

Brother Scruggs evidently had a
good time on a hayride he attended.
When asked if the rain gave him
a cold, he asked, “Did it rain ‘Sat-
urday night?”

In the midst of our noble group,

A the conclusion of a stormy and
wet ‘weekend throughout most of
the state and with news flowing in
not only from the four corners of
North Carolina but neighboring
States as well, your correspondent
is experiencing much difficulty in
choosing those tales that will bear
repeating. Perhaps by omitting a
few of the more lurid details, the
general public will got be too
shocked by the scandal that re-
mained in he wake of the partying
horde.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. —
Officials and students alike of the
University of Virginia are still up-

Paging the Professors .. .

By Stan Kennett ~’

PROF. W. M. THOMPSON

PROF. ERNEST BEATY

Even the faculty }s at times
subject to roll call. When that

time comes, it is Professor Beaty,
secretary 6f the faculty, who seeks
out the - absentees. Professor
Beaty has been secretary of the

ie faculty since 1940

and a member of

1940 is an out-

INDEPENDENTS
Ernie Stricklin’s recent chapel
talk was an admirable gesture.

Four hundred fifty Independents;
five hundred twenty-five Fraters.
If something is to be done
to organize this half of the stu-
dent-body, lets NOT do it as
though we were forming a “so-
ciety for the underprivileged.”
Some men are Independents
by choice. ie.
May it be said to the ever-ring-
ing glory of the' Davidson Fratern-
ity system that almost no discrim-
ination whatsoever is practised
here which would make Indepen-
dents feel “left out.”
_To_ freshman Independents,
let assurance be given that Da-
vidson men, proud of and
grateful for the privilege of be-
ing here; treat one another
with democratic mutual re-
spect, regardless of what or-
ganization they do or do not
belong to.

It is‘a good sign of a spirit of
demogracy to hear someone speak
up in-favor of making available to
all tHe’ students some of the advan-
tages’ now offered to anly half of
us, “**
