CO-ED EATING, from page 11

years, it would be logical to conclude
that the majority of Davidson students,
past and present, find it more artificial
to be a member of ageo-ed house than it
is to be a member of a single sex house.

Lucia then Proposes that the decline
of co-ed eating is probably the result of
the members of a co-ed eating house
being labeled as “weird” and “differ-
ent.” Give ussome credit. All (or atleast
the vast majority of) students at
Davidson are normal, well-adjusted
human beings. The degree of intellec-
tual development which this college
requires for admittance also seems to
imply maturity on the part of the indi-
vidual. I know of no mature person
who, just on the basis of social affili-
ation, would label a co-ed eater as
weird. If you look at any eating house,
you will find some members who are
radically different than the other mem-
bers of that house. It is very disappoint-
ing to hear that Lucia feels that
Davidson is a community of people
whoare all basically alike and ostracize
know that this is not the case. In every
house, male or female, there are ex-

amples of members who do not fit into
the “norms” of society yet are readily
accepted (guys with long hair and ear-
rings, women whodonotshave, people
of religions other than Christianity).
This is what makes Davidson so great.
There are very few small communities
like this where people can be accepted
for who they are.

Furthermore, a person who wants to
join a co-ed house should not be de-
terred by the opinions of others. I have
no sympathy for someone who cannot
make a choice based on what they really
want. I willadmit that itis not easy togo
against what everyone else is doing.
Yet, ata time when there were five or six
co-ed houses, surely co-ed eaters were
not the minority that they were last year
or lastsemester. This should have made
it relatively easier for a person to join a
co-ed house. He or she would have not
been the outcast that Lucia proposes co-
ed eaters were and are. Instead, he or
she would have been a member of an
accepted social alternative, even if co-
ed eaters were in the minority. Thus to
blame the failure of growthin the co-ed
houses on the single-sex houses is ri-
__diculous.

Enough on the decline of co-ed eating
houses. Single sex eating is not the so-

cial isolation and evil which Lucia tries
to imply. There must be some overrid-
ing positive factor which causes the vast
majority of people to choose them over
co-ed houses.

I think that this reason is obvious.
People of the same sex.feel more com-
fortable around members of the same
sex. This is due to the very similarities
which Lucia mentions in her article.
Guys like to be able to go to dinner and
be slobs. Girls do not want to have to

wear makeup everytime they gototheir .

house. Members of both sexes generally
feel more comfortable talking about
problems of their gender with other
members of that gender.

Members of the same sex tend to
understand and relate better to physical
and social problems, as they are more
likely to have experienced the same
problems/ This is not to say that guys
and girls cannot be open with one an-
other, but that there are some things
which members of the same sex can
share on a different level than they can
with members of the opposite sex.

I would also like to know if Lucia has
considered that her argument blatantly

members of all Patterson Court houses.
If this relationship, based on friendship
and trust, already exists between the
single sex houses, then why do’ the
majority of people, who are happy with
their relationships with oners need to
change?

By transforming a. system which al-
ready pleases such a large number of
students, we would be going against the
ideals of all the current members of the
court.

I realize that Lucia is not pioposing
that the houses all go co-ed. In turn, I
hope that Lucia realizes that the co-ed
eating houses failed because the major-
ity of people found something more
appealing about the single sex houses. It
is time for her to come to grips with the
fact that her preference failed. I do not
mean to suggest that the co-ed houses
were inherently
negative, just that people weighed their
choices and found that they could have

strong relationships with members of

the opposite sex and belong toone of the
current social organizations. Come on,
Lucia, and see the truth for what it is,
instead of what you would like it to be.
