Student Council Explores
Thefts Of Library Books

BY JOHN TODD

of books being taken—not borrowed—from the library.

The situation came to the
council's attention after the
Christmas holidays, during
which time dormitory ‘rooms
were searched for missing
books. According to Student
Body President John Spratt, ‘‘a
sizeable number” of the miss-
ing books turned up in students’
rooms. He told the council that
some of the volumes that were
found had been missing from
the library for more than two
years.

Letters were sent to the stud-
ents in whose rooms the missing
books were located. The recip-
ients of the letters were asked
to return the books and pay a
dollar fine; however, instead of
being turned in at the circula-
tion desk, some of the volumes
suddenly re-appeared on the
shelves of the library.

The matter is now in the hands
of the Dean of Students, Spratt
said; however, he told the coun-
cil, “I'd sort of like to see us
handle this to show that we're
responsible.”

The council seemed to be
against any ‘‘strong’’ action
against those who were found to
possess the missing books. But
‘it might take something string-
ent, ‘though, to get. the point
across," Spratt observed.

The library problem. dominat-
ed the discussion for more than
half of the hour that the council
met; however, no definite decis-
ion was reached.

Stemming from discussion

of the library, the idea of a
“Campus Community Code”
was mentioned by Spratt.
Such a code, he said, would
incorporate all the rules which
govern campus activities, in-
stead of having a different set
of regulations for the library,
gymnasium, dormitories and
other areas.

The council agreed that many
regulations are misunderstood
and that students are not aware
of other existing rules, A com-
mittee composed of Will Jack-
son, Bruce Swain, John Barrow
and Arnie Snider will look into
the idea of such a code for Dav-
idson. Spratt mentioned that he
had material from the National
Student Association on the idea

also.

Tommy Stafford, freshman
advisor, told the council to. be
thinking about revising the

Freshmen Regulations. ‘I think

we definitely need to change
them,"’ Stafford stated. Fresh-
men Council President Tom
Frist said that his group had
also discussed some changes.

Spratt then suggested that
the council encourage David-
son students to write their
Congressional representatives
in support of the Civil Rights
and tax-reform bills. He said
that he had been approached
by a member of the Davidson
Civil Rights group about such
an idea.

Dave Hardeman said that the
council had received much liter
ature from NSA on the Civil)
Rights bill and that such infor- |
mation could be used in this!
project. The council approved |
of using NSA material, but they |
were leary of ‘‘collaborating”’
with the Civil Rights group in
promoting the letter-writing
campaign: they voted unani
mously against the latter idea.

Before adjourning, | Spratt |
mentioned two other ideas. One |
was a self-study by the Student
Council. *‘This could be a com-
plete farce or a lot of fun,”
Spratt admitted. ‘The Student
Council can definitely do much
more than they are doing now.

ODK Questionnaire
Goes To Seniors

For the past several weeks
the Delta Circle of Omicron
Delta Kappa Fraternity has been
compiling a questionnaire deal-
ing with the strengths and weak
nesses of the academic life of
Davidson.

The questionnaire will be dis-
tributed to the seniors only. It
will examine the curriculum and
the academic facilities available
at Davidson.

These questionnaires will be
distributed personally by the
members of ODK to the entire
senior class at a date that will
be announced later by Joe
Howell, chairman of the Delta
Circle.

The results of the question.
naire will be compiled and ana
lyzed by the members of ODK
and presented to the Trustees

Group Will Oversee
Controversial Talks

BY HARRY CARR

To supervise the policy of the
college and of student groups for
inviting controversial speakers
to the campus, President D.
Grier Martin has appointed a
committee of three faculty
members and two students.

The committee members are
Dean of the Faculty Frontis
Johnston, Chaplain Will Terry,
Professor John Kelton, and John
Spratt and Will Jackson, presi-
dent and second vice-president
of the student council, respec-
tively.

Included in the policy are
three major points. First, “‘no
speaker shall be denied a hear-
ing on the campus because of
his membership in any organi-
zation." The policy further
states that the committee may,
however, prefer certain mem-
bers in an organization to others.

Another provision in the state-
ment explains the obligation of
the committee ‘‘when a speaker
is brought to the campus rep-

resenting a highly controversial
viewpoint . . . to see that the
other side of the issue is present-
ed within a reasonable length
of time." Finally, the policy
grants the committee the power
to remove assembly attendance
requirements, ‘“‘when an un-
usually controversial individual
is to speak."

Although the request is not a
part of the policy, President
Martin wants the committee to
avoid scheduling a night ap-
pearance when a speaker might
attract a large crowd from out-
side the college. In making the
request, he pointed out that Dav-
idson lacks a police force to
protect adequately the speaker
and the audience, and to discour-
age “unfortunate behavior.”

According to Chaplain Will
Terry, the committee recognizes
that the word ‘‘controversial”’ is
not easy to interpret. Therefore,
the committee requests that any
member of the college contact

COP AND RANGER

Two things should be said be-
fore I try to assess the argu
ments that each of these gentle-
men presented. First, the actual
issues of the question of the
existence of God were never
made more clear. As often hap
pens in a discussion of this sort,
the real issues are pushed to the
rear and are covered by a bar
rage of nebulous, unrelated, and
usually irrelevant points. Tues
day night was a brilliant exam
ple of how it is possible. for a
discussion of this nature to occur
without getting absurdly out of
the ball park.

Second, it is usually admitted
that a discussion between
scientific philosopher, e.g.,

a
a

| logical positivist or a member of

the analytic school, and a Chris
tian theologian, is likely to be
not only overwhelmingly futile,
but probably very dry.

This is admitted because usu

| ally the initial assumptions that

each of the men start with are
so radically different. that there
| is no* common grounds from
| which to launch a fertile discus-
| sion. No agreement is ever pos-
sible, because neither wish to
grant the other's assumptions,

theologian has not done __ his
homework in logic, linguistic

philosophy.

One expects, then, and
usually gets a pathetic discus-
sion between a _ philosopher
who throws the logical ball to
the theologian, and who, in
return, not only refuses to take
his turn at bat, but is perfect-
ly willing to allow the ball to
roll dead behind homeplate.

However, and this is probably
more to the credit of Dr. Mac-
Cormac in particular, and to the
college in general, than most
people have realized: Dr. Mac-
Cormac is a fine example of a
theologian-philosopher who has
done his homework, and who has
done it well.

Dr. Scriven’s presentation was
both general, in an inductive
sense, and necessarily particu-
lar. His thesis, that the meaning-
fulness of belief must be sup-
ported by evidence, and that if
one feels he has a ‘‘private pipe-
line to Truth,"’ then he must
establish a reliable procedure

sent to a. speaker.

To be more specific, ‘‘one’s

no more sophisticated than :

dence to support such a belief

was the green dragon in the next

believe in, probably because
dragons are mythical and no
one has ever been able to pro
duce any reliable proof of hav

say that God exists, or is in the
next room, equally stupid,
because no one has ever seen

MacCORMAC
Yes, Virginia...

God, and those who make such
claims to religious knowledge
and revelation are never able to
produce any reliable evidence
for their claim.

Scriven intimated § rather .
bluntly that the “looney bins’
are full of a great many of
this type of person who claims
he is Jesus Christ, or Napol-
eon, or George Washington. In
fact, he seemed quite right
when he said that the argu-
ment from religious exper-
lence is fallacious since it
presupposes the existence or .
the knowledge of such exper-
ience in the first place, and,
therefore, is no criterion for
validification.

Second, there is the claim
made by Dr. MacCormac that

Reviewer

God, Who is beyond man, is a
paradox. Our language is not
explicit when we talk about God.
Thus, when one questions the
love or the intelligence of God,
as Scriven does, he must realize
that the love and intelligence of
God exist in a different realm,
the spiritual realm. God need not
snatch small children from be
neath street cars and not snatch
gangsters away, nor need He
be able to execute elementary
arithmetic calculations, His love
and. intelligence are “‘beyond
man.”"

The. scientific evidence that
Scriven is looking for is not ap
plicable to the spiritual or in
finite realm. We cannot measure
God's leve and intelligence with
a yardstick that man defines
When we talk about God we do
so symbolically and paradoxi
cally, and this involves, I be
lieve, a sort of transcendent
leap of faith

MacCormac felt that (1) man
was responsible for the evil in
the world, not God. God made
man free to choose: (2) Scriven
cannot limit reality, as he does,
merely to the spatio-temporal
world. There is another reality
beyond the temporal “in which
God reveals Himself paradoxi
cally." What one has when he
tries to talk about God is a
**metaphysical symbolism which
points toward a truth which he
is trying to get at."

Scriven would allow neither
of these points. “It may be
that Ged has made man free
to act and choose as he wills,
but this does not free God, who
is all-powerful, from His re-
sponsibility for allowing small
children to be run down. God
could have intervened.” One
just cannot escape this situa-
tion.

Second, to say that God is
inexplicable and that our lan-
guage is symbolic is to “throw
the baby out with the bath
water."’ Scriven says, “If one
believes that God exists and
describes Him as good, power-
ful, and so forth, then one may
look for evidence of such a
benevolent creature. If He is
inexplicable, then one should
quit trying to describe Him, be-
cause when the first shred of
evidence is presented for such
a belief, the inexplicable has
been described." This is a vio-
lent contradiction of terms.

An Atheist Shakes Foundation

It seemed unusual to find Chamber’s auditorium filled to IFC Concert capacity on a Tuesday night. But what
was even more remarkable was that the apathetically defined Davidson crowd was gathered to hear two highly
intelligent philosophers discuss the ancient question of the existence of God.

They were not, as one student remarked, “Just some other hillbilly holy-rollers about to roll in the aisles of
Chambers.” In fact, as every one expected, Dr. Earl MacCormac, with an exceptional understanding of both the
ments for the existence of God and of the traditional attacks made against such an existence by scientific
philosophers, was a good match—considering “what he had to work with”—for the polished, Oxford-trained
philosopher from the University of Indiana, Dr. Michael Scriven.

Finally, Scriven said that he
did not wish to restrict reality
to the empirical world, nor per
ception to the five or six senses.
“But if you want to show that
you have perceived something
(God), then you: must prove that
you. have not merely made an
error of conceptualism. God's
existence may well — enjoy
status of immateriality, but He
must interact with the world
and one must say something
meaningful about how He knows
of this interaction.”

MacCormac not, from
within. a Theism,
make sense when talking about
God. His language did not in
clude those words which were
capable of unambiguously bridg
ing the gap between infinite and
finite.

In MacCormac’s favor came
one point which finally dem-
onstrated that he had done his
homework and indicated a
deviation from the theological
mumbo - jumbo words of
“paradox,” “‘transcendence,”’
“faith,” and “wholly Other’’
which Davidson students are
tired of hearing in compul-
sory ‘Sunday School’’ classes.

That point was that Scriven
was actually lacking in a vali-
dating procedure himself.
Scriven defined the presentation
of scientific and empirical evi-
dence as the criterion for belief.

But when he was asked about
the validity of such a procedure,
he was forced to do that which
his procedure would not allow:
namely, to go outside of his
realm for validification, It was

Weekend

Social-Minded ’Cats
Search Cool Escapes

BY GREG GOVAN

It is Midwinters, again, and another weekend for
Davidson to travel the yellow brick ey to its own

version of the Emerald City.

While there may be no

Wizard at the end, the IFC has provided a (very) few

scarecrows, tin men, and li

ons along the way, and the

whole thing may well start with a twister.

A weekend traditionally be-
gins with the dedicated CORE
(Committee On Radical Enjoy-
ment) meeting at Mrs. Mor
gan's, which features ballistics
problems involving empty cans
and. Southern Railway freight
trains. For the more inhibited,
Midwinters begins with basket

" ball. Dates and students, cram

med into one side of the gym,
for the third
straight Wildcat  triple-figure
win, over Georgia Southern.

After the game, there will be
a coffee hour in the Union to
discuss the theological aspects
of victory. For variety, Cham
bers Banquet Hall will host
Addie, Doris, Shirley, and Bever-
ly, corporately known as. the
Shirelles, who will probably
lead one to conclude that “‘love
is a swinging thing."’

Oh yes, the IFC did have
something for Saturday. Count
Basie will play somewhere in
Chambers auditorium at 3 p.m.
Students are warned to queue up
early, as many townspeople are
under the impression that the
Mount Holly Recorder Choir is
still under contract, and large
crowds are expected.

The winter minds of Davidson
have been properly stirred for
something. Thanks to a liberal
first Vespers and the YMCA
forum, plus extra-curricular
reading in Time, most everyone
sees that morals and the old
desert god of wrath and ven
geance behind them are not what
they used to be. This doesn't
mean it will be an arnoral week
end, but at least students know
someone cares that the cloth of
a Davidson gentleman may be a
bit too tight, and that makes
wearing it a little easier.

And it is just possible some
few may wonder about a basis
for all the falderal for enjoying
themselves, now that it cannot
be rebellion. This weekend will
be, to a large extent, left up to
individual devices, a . difficult
thing for which to blame others.

And the freshmen are liberat
ed at last from Greek Week,
that venerable disruption | of
schedules which proves indeed
the upper classes have the col
lective upper hand. Freedom is
something of a keynote for this
Midwinters

to be filled with more contrasts
than a typical Davidson argu
ment. The usually effective and
precise movements of the bas
ketball team will be countered in
a host of shouting twisting en
thusiasts at after-parties. And
Count Basie, something of a
grand old man of music, — will
serve as a foil to the modern
derrierre guarde of unsophisti-
cated swing.

obvious that Scriven was trap-

However, there is still some
doubt about the meaningfulness
of such an attack. Nevertheless,
though it is a point well made,
probably the best that MacCor-
mac had, it seemed like a last
resort to attack from this direc-
tion. It seems that religion, be-
lief in the existence of God, is
really only a question of faith
and which rules one is willing
to allow when this game of faith
is played.

The best point that Scriven
made was that it is a game, and
when one bets a lot, he should
do so only in the face of jolly-

word of the kid down the street.
There can be no genuine safety
in numbers: gross acceptance
means nothing, “if it did, the
world would still be flat’ and
chemists would be experiment-

the beach is too cold, and the

are always the indoor sports. An
expanded forecast might read,
generally cool and wet, with oc-

Winter at Davidson can be a
singularly uninteresting pheno-
menon. It is with a great deal
of accidental wisdom that the
repetitious season is broken into
tolerable segments by Christ
mas, semester break, and Mid
winters.

The first two send students to
explore winter at home or on ski
slopes; in the Piedmont, in Dav-

many, the most that can be said
