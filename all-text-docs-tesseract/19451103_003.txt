no “pushover”, and Davidson showed plenty of fighting

that the game was
spirit during the entire game. The Harding Rams just
knew what they were against, and played their game ac-
cording.

The Wildkittens right guard spot suffered heavily
when Herb Waldrop was forced to leave the game for a
short while due to a slight chest injury, and then when
his sustitute, Louie Hart, had to withdraw when. his right
leg was hurt. The team had to bank on the blocking of
Carlyle Charles until Waldrop returned to the game. ‘To
make it 100% for the guards, “Doc” Bailey managed to
get a foot injury.

Coach Shepherd madé several changes in his lineup
last Friday afternoon to make up {f6r the previous loss
last week in an attempt to gain more speed in the back-
field, and to plug up the spots in the line left by injuries.
Ward Lasley was shifted from fullback to tailback, with
John Sherrill, who played an outstanding game of ball
against Harding, taking over Ward’s former position, bob
moved over to take the right guard spot, and “Flash”
Morrison is now at center. Fred McAlister, who formerly
played end, was selected to take over at left guard, but [’m
afraid we're going to lose Mac to the Navy, as he just
received his orders to report to Duke, Nov. 1 to take up
his V-5 training. We wish you the best of luck,, Mac.

Getting more up to date, the Wildkittens came back
last Friday afternoon to make up for the previous lose
pushed Barium Springs to a 18-0 defeat. The Davidson
boys had it over Barium all the way in weight, speed,
and shiftiness, and they put all of this ability to good use
in the first half scoring three touchdowns before Barium
could get a good hold. However, after the half time Bar-
ium Springs seemed to be a different ball club altogether,
and they gave the ‘Kits a slight scare when they started
a passing attack which brought them seven yards from
paydirt. Davidson still held the upper hand and continued
to move Barium.back down the field, even to the one foot
line, but they just couldn’t see to make the score.

The Wild kittens second team showed their inferior-
ity When they took ovér less than 10 yards from the goal
with four downs to go, and still couldn’t drive’ across.
Even so, Gurney Boren was outstanding in running play,
and showed us all that he was a natural broken field run-
ner.

Turning to intra-murals, it seems as though the SPEs
are the ones most likely to succeed in the competition for
championship judging from last Saturday’s standing. Some
thought the Betas didn’t have much to offer this_year, but
they have shown tip well in most oftheir games, and
stand a good chance of winning before it is all over. Cam-
pus connoisseurs predict a brilliant future for the Kappa
Sig-SAE nine, and past games have proved them almost
right. No one can say that the Pi Kapps didn’t try. With
no wins to their credit they still stayed in the race fight-
ing every game hard. : :

ORIGIN OF BASKETBALL

Basketball is the only major sport

played in the United States which is

lpurely of American origin, All other

games either are direct importations

from foreign lands, or hybrids.

Dr. James A, Naismith created -bas-
ketball while he was a physical di-
rector at the Y.M.C.A, in Springfield,
Mass., late in 1891, but the first real
game was not played until Jan. 20,
1892. sd

Here is Dr, Naismith’s story about
the origin Basketball, written in
1937, while he was professor at the
University of Kansas, in Lawrence.
Dr. Naismith died several years ago.

“In the fall of '91, the physical di
rectors of the country had come to
the conclusion that maybe neither the
German, Swedish or French system
gave us the kind of work that would
hold our membership in the Y's.

“We decided that there should be a
game that could be played indoors
in the evening and during the winter
seasons, Dr. Gulick assigned me the
‘task of inventing a game to fill this
particular part of our work. He was
led to assign this work to me because
of a couple of statements I had made
that it was possible to invent such a
game and that mature individuals did
not desire physical development but
some enjoyable form of recreation.

“T first tried to modify some of the
existing games so that they would

of

meet the requirements, but failed to.

make any game suitable for indoor
work, I then left out the idea of any
individual game and began to think
of the fundamental principles of all
games, I discovered that in all team
games some kind of a ball was used.

“Thé next step was to appreciate
the fact that football was rough be-
cause you had to allow the defense
to tackle because the offense ran with
the ball. Accordingly if the offense
didn’t have an apportunity to run with
the ball, there would be no necessity
for tackling and, we would thus elim-
inate roughness.

“This is the fundamental principal of
basketball. ;

“The next step was to secure some
kind of a goal through which the ball
could be passed. In thinking of up-
right goals, the fact was brought out
that the more force that was put on
the ball, the more likelihood there was
of having it pass through the goal.
It then occured that if the ball be
thrown in a curve it would not be
necessary nor advisable to put
much force on the ball,

“TI decided that. by making the goal
horizontal the ball would have to be
thrown in a curve,
severe driving of a ball; In order to
avoid having the defense congregate
around the goal, it was placed above
their heads, so that once the ball left
the individual’s hands, it was not likely
to be interferred with.

“The rules were made to eliminate
roughness such as shouldering, push-
ing, kicking, etc. The ball was to be
handled with the hands only. It could
not be drawn into the body and thus
encoourage roughness,

“The manner of putting the ball in-
to play was then considered. Two in-
dividuals were selected and took their
stations in the midtile_of the floor, The
ball was thrown up so as to land be-
tween them, giving as nearly equal
chance as possible. The nearest ap-
proach to the ball needed was the
soccer ball. which was selected.

“To get goals, we used a couple

A lateral-torward pass combina-

in the first half accounted the
game's only score as the Betas down-
ed the Independents 6-0. The Betas
held the upper hand throughout the
contest and were on_ their
ten when the game ended.

In one of the roughest games of the
season the KAs, sparked by Mahones
passing, emerged victorious over the
PIKAs by virtue of a 2-1 inargin in

Phi Dels—SPE

Brownson's passess were too much
for the SPEs as the Phi Delts rallied
in the second half to hand the red
and purple boys their first defeat of
the season, 12-0.

KA--SPE
The SPEs returned to their victor-

cision over the KAs, scoring on a
short aerial from Rabb to Hopper
just before the half. The KAs had a
bit of bad luck as Choate grabbed a
pass from Mahone and trucked acr6ss
the goal line twd minutes before the
final whistle, only to have tHe play
nullified by an offside penalty.

% Phi, Delts—Independents

Although outclassed, the Indepen-
dents put up a game fight but were
unable to do anything about Brown-
son's accurate heaving. The Phi Delt
Star connected with three touchdown
passes to Cameron, Witherspoon, and
Golden ,to give his team a 18-0 tri-
umph, :

SPE—Kappa Sig, SAE

The SPEs pulled the old sleeper
play in the second half as Owens
caught a pass from Herndon to down
a hardfighting Kappa Sig, SAIE com
bine 8-0. Barr tagged Wall in the
end zone for the remaining two points.

In other games during this period
the Kappa Sig-SAEs handed the Phi-

the SPEs downed the Betas 12-0; the
PikKas beat the Pi Kappa Phis 6-0;
