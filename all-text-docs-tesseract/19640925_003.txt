IFC Announces Entertainment For

There'll be a pot of enter-
tainment gold waiting at the
end of the rainbow for
dance lovers when the top-
notch Russian ballet and
folk dance ensemble, the
Raduga Dancers, appear in
Chambers Auditorium. Ra-
duga (pronounced RAH-du-
gah) is the Russian word for
rainbow, and the name was

chosen especially for this
star group of dancers
and musicians as_ being

the most descriptive of the
troupe and its colorful pro-
gram of song, music and
dance.

Raduga’s dazzling spect-
rum of talents includes clas-
sical ballet dancers drawn
from the star rosters of such
famous Russians companies
as the Bolshoi Ballet, the
Stanislavsky Theatre, and
the Bolshoi International
Company in Moscow; the
Navoi Opera and Ballet
Theatre in Tashkent, Uzbe-
kistan; the State Academic

Rainbow Of Russian Entertainment

Theatre of Opera and Ballet
in Latvia; and the Bylorus-
sii State Theatre. Folk
dancing stars from such
companies as the Moiesevev
in Moscow will perform vib-
rant peasant dances, and
favorite Russian songs will
be sung by a top Russian
contralto.

A favorite accordion-duo
will present the music that
has made it a top radio and
recording attraction
throughout Russia. A fleet-
fingered Balalaika champ-
ion will play both classical
and folk selections. Four
athletic Georgian dancers
will add their own brand of
fire to this varied program
which will be topped by a
show-stopper from the froz-
en north---a wrestling match
for solo soloist.

In making up its colorful
program of dance, music
and song, the Raduga
troupe has selected as un-
usual combination of Rus-

sian dance elements to be
presented by star perform-
ers. Both classical ballet and
exotic folks dances will give
audiences a _ kaleidoscopic
view of the rich and varied
dance culture of Russia.

Classical ballet came to
Russia about 1735 by way
of France and Italy and was
a favorite entertainment in
the court of the Czars.
About fifty years before the
First World War, Russia
became the undisputed capi-
tal of the ballet world, and
Russians brought new vig-
or to the dance through
their strong theatrical
sense and dramatic in-
Stincts.

After the Revolution it
was thought that classical
ballet might not properly
reflect the proletarian views
of the new Soviet regime,
but slowly, as the govern-
ment solidified its position,
ballet was restored to its
place in the forefront of
Soviet arts and in the hearts
of the Russian people. To-
day, the ballet companies of
Moscow and Leningrad are
famous throughout the
world, and “Russian ballet”
is a term synonymous with
colorful, highly theatrical
dance presentations.

Folk dancing, a part of
all cultures, is particularly
rewarding experience when
presented by dancers of the
U.S. S. R. The Soviet Union
can offer an unrivalled vari
ety of such dances, since it
recognizes 180 different na-
tional groups in the fifteen
republics. As performed bs
members of the Raduga
Dancers, they come alive
with a vital athletic quality
which still permits expres-
sion of simple poetry.

The dancers of the Radu-
ga company are champion

exponents of both classical”

and folk dancing, and are
the headliners of their vari-
ous Russian companies. The
young Tartar dancer Shamil
Yagudin is a star attraction
of the Bolshoi Ballet in Mos-
cow and is noted for the
fire and dash of his per-
formances in ballet by

Khatchaturian and Proko-—

fiev, as well as in the more
classical repertory.

On a par with the sterling
talents of the Raduga danc-
ers are the sparkling at-
tractions chosen to
plement the choreographic
side of the troupe’s pro-

' gram. Accordion-duo Niko-
| lai Krilov and Anatole Shal-
aev are a staple of musical

life in Russia through their
many concert and radio
appearances and recordings.
The “bayan,” as the accord-
ion is known in Russia, has
always been a tremendous-
ly popular instrument, and

Their repertory again re-
fiects the versatility. de-
manded of the Raduga com-
pany. They play not only
Russian popular and folk
songs, but classical pieces
and works by modern Soviet
composers. They also serve
as accompaniment to the
songs sung by Zikina, who
will offer a full complement
of her most beloved folk
melodies sung in a contralto

gram of Russian music and
dance would be complete—
or honest—if it contained
no balalaika music.

A brisk gridiron tilt, denouing in a Wildcat victory,
could provide the punch for a great Homecoming on Oc-
tober 17. Should circumstances prove otherwise, the

ch Artist Series and the Interfraterity Council have Coach

Dole backstopped with supplementary entertainment.

The Raduga Dancers, Bal-
let and Folk Ensemble are
scheduled to open the week-

IRC: The Ver Ahead

It is the opinion of the 1964-65 Interfraternity
Council that the Fraternity System at Davidson
College can and should play a vital and constructive

role in the program of the college community. Frat-
ernities have been accused, and perhaps understand-

ably so in the past, of collective isolation from the
mainstream of campus activity. This council believes
that such separation from the extracurricular bene-
fits offered by the Davidson community leads to
stagnancy within the Fraternity System, and rend-
ers our place in the college life unjustifiable.

For this reason, we intend the exploit whatever
talent and whatever vision may be found within so
important a segment of the student body as the col-
lection of 12 fraternities. We will propose a program
during the coming year whereby the Fraternity Sys-

tem, through the organization of the IFC,
tribute positively to the social
the
constitutional responsibility, and. we in-

advancement of

Our

tional

can con-

men within its ranks.

tend to fulfill it to the best of our. ability within
the limits of our budget and our opportunity.

The cornerstone. of the program we offer is
variety. We hope to involve the entire system in ac-
tive pursuit of scholarship and cultural appreciation,
and in the enjoyment of high quality entertainment.
Socially, we have scheduled dances and concerts
featuring entertainers in fields ranging from folk
music to jazz, from rhythm and blues to big band.

The complete schedule for the IFC year will be
published in the next few weeks. We hope that to-
morrow’s Pledge Regatta and the Homecoming
Weekend outlined on this page will demonstrate the
sincerity.of our promises at the outset, and will en-
courage the student body to share enthusiasm with
which the IFC approaches the 1964-65 school year.

the age-old traditions of his
people, and a God given tal-
ent. For Sabicas is a Spanish
Gypsy and to the Gypsy the
spriit of music comes as
naturally as eating, breath-
ing-life, or death.

As a child in his native
Andalusia, Sabicas grew up
among the music, dance,
and colorful ways of his
people, the Gitanos, as they
are called in pain. When
Sabicas was five years old,
he received his only lesson
from an uncle who knew
only two guitar chords, The
boy played these two chords
and soon began to learn
more on. his own.

An artist was in the mak-
ing: Three years later his
mother, deciding the’ boy
should have a more formal
education, brought him be-
fore the best teacher in
Pamplona who.asked him to
play. When the young Sabi-
cas. performed. a_ fantastic
run of notes on the guitar,
the teacher accused them to
make fun of him ‘and ran

La Chelita at the El Dorado
Theatre in Madrid. He later
won first prize in a nation-
wide guitar competition and
his professional career. was
launched.

It was probably most fort-
unate for the world that this
one artist never fell victim
to academic routine, his ag-
ent reports. Had Sabicas en-
tered a conservatory, he
would most likely have
graduated as just another
good guitar player among
the many hundreds in
Spain. A a self-taught musi-
cian, Sabicas was able to re-
tain that natural spark of
the Gypsy, the fire and the
exotic blending of beauty
and savagery that is true
flamenco.
