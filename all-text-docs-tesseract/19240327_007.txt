Who Knows?

To be appointed candle snuffer was gen-
erally agreed in 1856 to be the highest honor
that could be paid to a Freshman in the
Commencement exercises. To do this he was
compelled to cross the platform, and, should
he snuff the light out there was great ap-
plause.

In 1859 the Eumenean Literary Society |’

“reluctantly” granted permission to four
young ladies to “attend our next irregular
debate, to gratify an earnest desire on their
part.” The following minutes state: “They
remained about 17 minutes, which time was
amply sufficient to satiate their awful anx-
iety, and then they made their exit.”

In 1856 students were required to rise 15!
minutes before sunrise.

In the middle ages of the college history |
the college professors were chastised for |
tardy attendance to regular faculty meet: |
ings, the last to arrive being compelled to |
act as secretary.

In the scholastic year of 1856-57, of the
83 Davidson students only 22 were members
of any church.

The class of 1869 holds the college, if
not the world, record for scholastic standing,
its members making an average of 97.31 for
the four years. The lowest average of any
student for his entire college course was 91
per cent.

In 1908 Davidson had its first intercollegi-

taste.

ch coveted position on the all-state}
Hin, This alone is a record few have |
surpassed, to make all-state the first)
year on the varsity. He was also David- |
son’s high-point man in this season, scor- |
ing an average of over II points per game
for the 13 games, making a total of 154
points. |

In the ’23 season he was again David-|
son’s mainstay and high-point man. He
chalked up 146 of the 504 points scored |
during the season. He outjumped and
outplayed every center he opposed the
whole season. Mauze’s work in his two!
vears on the team is a wonderful ecx-
ample of what hard work, a stick-to-it |
spirit and good coaching can do for an)
inexperienced athlete.

Not satisfied with basketball alone,
George donned the stripes and leats for
the '23 season and pulled down an out-
field position on “Buck” Currie’s Wild- |
cat nine. He was a dependable player
both i nthe field and at the bat and made |
his “D” in this sport also.

Mauze stood high .in other student ac-
tivities as well. He wrote forthe David- |
sonian and belonged to the Reporters’
Club. He belonged tothe Volunteer
Band, was a member of the Student
Council and the Executive Committee of!
the Athletic Association. He was a pop-|
ular man among his fellows and was
clected secretary and treasurer of his
class for the senior year. |

George entered Union Theological
Seminary last fall and is now studying
for the ministry. His college mates will |
predict great things for him in his
chosen profession.

presents a serious crisis. It de-
