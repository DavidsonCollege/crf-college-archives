“only real fireworks of the game began. Joe
McCall, halfback, Davidson's pride and joy,
cut his way 23 yards nearer the Soldiers’
goal on a spin play. One play later Fraley
tossed a short» pass to that same half, and
he, fighting to keep from being run out of
bounds, slithered his way to the only touch-
down of the game. The try for extra point
fell short.

The Bulldogs became thoroughly aroused
after this score, and launched their most
sustained threat of the game. Jennings, Wil-
son, and McIntosh, Coach Johnny Floyd's
powerful trio, pushed \the ball up to the
Wildcats’ 14-yard line by pretty running and
passing work. Here the redoubtable ’Cat

Glee Club Sponsors
Annual Stunt Night

Attractive Cash Prize Prize to be Given to
Class Presenting Best Program

On the night following the Home-Com-
ing game, the annual Stunt Night program
and other festivities will be held in Cham-
ber’s Auditorium under the direction of the
Glee Club. Stunt Night on Home-Coming
Day has become an institution of the Da-
vidson campus, and in years past’ it has con-
tributed largely to the success of that day
and to the entertainment of the alumni and
visitors who are with us then.

This year, as usual, the four classes in
competition with each other will be respon-
sible for the bulk of the entertainment, and
the class which is judged to have the best
stunt will receive a cash prize. Last year the
stunts were all good, and as many men of
the upperclassmen will again be in the stunts.
there is great promise of having an unusu-
ally brilliant performance.

Aside from this, the Glee Club Quartet,
composed of J. D. Koontz, W. Rule, E. Z.
DuBose, and J. H. Ramseur, will give a few
selections during the evening, and the Da-
vidson Orchestra, which gained a great deal
of attention last year, will make its first ap-
pearance of the season.

From each class the following men will
be in their respective stunts. Seniors: “Hub”
Covington, Joe McCall, Bill .Mason, and
“Boots” Wilson. Juniors: Charlie Spencer,
“Mick” Bradshaw, Billy Franklin, John B.
Regin, Sam Wiley, Bob Orr, Bob Roland,
and Horace Ervin. Sophomores: Bill Mon-
roe, Oscar Norman, John Marvin, Bruce
Sugg, Woodrow Caligan, George Vick, Bill
Hayes, and Charlie Norfleet. Freshmen: Al
Tong and Brad ‘McLean.
