THE DAVIDSONIAN

Sigs Set Hot Pace In IMAC

An old adage relates that
“every body loves a win-
ner.”’ but this truism seems
not to ae to flicker-

The Kappa-Sigs dominat-
ed action this weekend and
extended their winning
streak to 51 straight games.

Rallying from early deficits,
they overtook both the SAE’s
and the Phi Gams, 20-7 and
33-13 respectively. The Sigs, led
by captain Tommy Reams and
tailback Ray Garrison, utilized
a well-balanced offense and a
tough defense in demonstrating

creasing his total to six for three
games. Senior David Brown
played two sterling defensive
and offensive games.

The Phi Delts scored two
touchdowns in the final two min-

utes to defeat the Pi Kap’s
Monday, 18-12. Two passes
from tailback Buzzy Parker to

Rufus Adair tallied three
TD's for the ATO’s, leading the
Taus past the Sigma Nus 34-12.
The Nus, without their tailback

Dear Editor:

Surprisingly, this letter does not concern any press
ing issues such as fraternity rush, campus religion or the
sexual mores of America; it simply concerns a matter of
importance to the Davidson tradition.

Doesn't it seem fitting that the only person ever to be
selected as the Most Valuable Player in the Southern
Conference for all three of his varsity basketball sea
sons should at least have contributed enough to David-
son College to justify the retirement of his jersey. This
tradition is commonly observed: by other major. colleges
and universities throughout the country for such out
standing athletes.

All America Fred Hetzel's big number 44 is re
membered not only: by those. students who attended David
son during his. career, but also by thousands of alumn
who gained renewed interest in the old alma mater due

to his. efforts.

We feel certain that we are expressing the feelings of
countless other students and alumni w ho would be in favor
of such action.

RECRUITING VIA BARBERS

| sat in the window beside the checkerboard and listen-
ed to Joe (the barber) as he rambled on about Charles Scott.

“Well, I don't know what I can tell you about Charles
that you'd want to put in the paper,’ Joe drawled lazily as
his fellow barbers struggled with a one year old getting
his first hair cut and his mother with her camera in hand.

“Gordon (a co-barber) probably knows him best; he
met him when he came up here to see the Hetzel-Cunningham
game last year.

“TI didn’t really meet Charles until this summer when he
came up here for Lefty's camp.

“Then one evening I passed him on the street talking
to a couple of teenage girls. ‘You got to come to school
here. Lefty said he'd give me tickets for four years if I
got you to come’, I told him.

“Well we talked a litte, you know, and then I asked him
again if he thought he'd come, and he says he thinks he will;
so we talked some more.”

“Finally I had to go and he says to me, ‘You'll get your
tickets whether Lefty gives them to you or not, cause I'm
going to play here."

Charles Scott is a Negro basketball player. He also is
number one academically in his class at Laurinburg Insti-
tute. But of most note now, he is an applicant for early
admission to Davidson College.

Davidson's informal and somewhat unique method of re-
cruiting Scott might draw chuckles from such basketball
powers as UCLA, Duke, and Michigan. I doubt Lew Al-
cindor, high school’s most sought after player since Wilt
Chamberlain, met a single Los Angeles barber when he
went to UCLA.

But barbers, mostly on their own, but with some
prompting from Lefty, just might turn chuckles into tears.

“Somebody fixed him up with a date, I believe,"’ Joe told
me. ‘‘He got along with the teenage girls though. He went
to the teen canteen some.”

Then Joe flashed a big smile and said, ‘I think he sort
of started liking one girl.’

So add local talent to the recruiters.

ends, Scott averaged 23 points a game as a junior

Coach Driesell admits frankly, ‘Scott is good enough to

play anywhere.”

As Joe told me, ‘Barry Teague said to me, ‘He looks
like he’s in a class by himself.’ And Hetzel said, ‘He can
play for any varsity team right now.’ I'll say one thing
about it, he’s a basketball player.

And maybe ours.
