Alfonso Carillo is a name
that is becoming as well-
known around’ the Davidson
athletics as Jimmy Poole.

The Richardson Scholar.
who hails from Quito, Ecua-
dor, has been making quite
an impression on Davidson
soccer fans as well as on
opposing teams. Thus far the
flashy center forward has
scored 17 goals.

The success that Carillo has
had may be due in part to
his style of play. a style rem-
iniscent of soccer played in
South America. This type of
play features the individual
more, and it requires great
finesse.

Finesse is the thing that
Carillo is good at. Soccer
Coach Harry Fogleman said.
His confident ball-handling
and cool shooting in the midst
of otherwise rough play are
two of the team’s greatest as-
sets.

Fogleman, needless to say.
has found Carillo an invalua-
ble addition to ‘his team. He
pointed out that it is quite
possible that Carillo will per-
sonally exceed the goal out-
put for last year's whole
team.

The ‘66 ‘Cats managed to
boot 22 goals. This season's
squad has already scored 28.
with Carillo contributing 17.

Carillo’s scoring boots have
come on a variety of differ-
ent types of plays, but per-
haps the most exciting was a
goal he kicked in the Witd-
cats’ opener. Standing about
ten yards from the goal with
a defender on him and the
goalie closely guarding the
goal, Carillo lifted the ball
to shoulder height with his
toe. Then. without turning to

ed as much coordination with
his feet as an American boy
has with his hands from
playing basketball or football.

“T would say his ball con-
trol is as good as any soccer
player we have had at Da
vidson or have played against
at Davidson."* Fogleman said.
His ball control allows him
to go around the defenders in
either direction. while most
players have effective moves
just to one side or the other.

The only flaw that can be
seen in Carillo’s playing is
a tendency to take it a little
too easy on defense. Again
this can be accounted for by
his not being accustomed to
the American style of play.

‘Americans play like they
do in Europe,” Carillo said.
“That is. rough. I think what
they need to do is try to
learn to handle the ball .bet-
ter, have a_ little more
finesse."

Carillo gets a great deal of
help from the rest of the
soccer team, exceptionally
well-rounded this year. Bill
Horton and Roger Peterson
require a lot of attention from
the defense and this helps
work.

In Wednesday's 1-1 tie with
Belmont Abbey, Carillo got
the lone ‘Cat goal. making a
penalty kick look easy. Then,
with about a minute left in
the second pvertime period.
he narrowly missed the win-
ning score with a direct kick
from just outside the goalie
area.

such an honor for Carillo. He

Scoring, Correction Lifts

Old Dominion Over DC

By 808 REID
Sports Editor

Because of an error in
scoring, the Wildcat sail-
ors learned this week
they lost a meet they
thought they had won.

Team Captain. Tom Kirtley
received a fetter this week
from the officials at the Old
Dominion Fall Invitational
Regatta informing him that
a review of the score cards
proved that Davidson lost the
regatta to Old Dominion last
weekend in Norfolk, Va. by
“one point.

The ‘Cats left the regatta
believing they had defeated
Old Dominion by four points,
and William and Mary by
nine. But the final decision
gave Old Dominion 32 points
and Davidson 31. William and
Mary was credited with 24
points.

“The judges were right
the second time,” Kirtley
said. “We should have lost.

1 don’t know wha! the prob-
fem was.”

A series of mistakes cost
Davidson points which would
have given them a clear mar-
gin. Kirtley said. Davidson
skipper Tad Lowdermilk
fouled out in the first race.
costing the team valuable
points.

Then in another race Kirt-
ley tried to foul out an Old
Dominion boat. which would
have cost the winners the
meet. But in all the confusion
he fouled a William and Mary
boat by mistake.

But, Kirtley said. Lowder-
milk redeemed himself later
in the meet by fouling out
an Old Dominion craft at the
finish line. costing Old Do-
minion that race.

Lowdermilk forced the
foul by switching the boom

thus giving him the right

of way on a turn. He then
cut into the path of the Old

Dominion boat, which was

unable to avoid a bump.

Kirtley skippered for the
‘Cats in the A division races,
with Roger Powell as crew.
Lowdermilk skippered in B
division with John Moore as
crew,

Each division sailed five
races, Kirtley said. Davidson
picked up three first during
the regatta, he added.

“The other teams had a
better advantage sailing in
home waters,”’ Kirtley said.
The regatta was held in Wil-
loughby Bay near Hampton
Roads. William and Mary
and Old Dominion are both
within 25 miles of the bay.

The ‘Cats were also crip-
pled because they were un-
familiar with Penguin

boats, which all contest-
ants had to use. “None of
us had ever sailed Pen-
guins before,’ Kirtley said.

“We didn’t know ‘how to
handle them too well, es-
pecially in strong winds.”

Brisk winds buffeted the
sailors in the morning. Kirt-
ley said. but in the afternoon
the breeze died down ‘‘to
pulfs."

“Our kind of wind.” Kirt
ley added.

Davidson’s three first
came after the winds had
died down, Kirtley said.

Tomorrow the 'Cats travel

to Columbia, S. C.. for the

Invitational Regatta on Lake
Murray. “USC and Old Do
minion are the teams ‘to
beat."’ Kirtley said. ‘‘and the
College of Charleston has
good skippers."'

The next home. regatta will
be Nov. 4-5, when Davidson
challenges Duke on Lake
Norman. “Duke shouldn't be
much competition,” Kirtley
muttered.
