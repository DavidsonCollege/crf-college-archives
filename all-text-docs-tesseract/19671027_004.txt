The Davidson Wildcats.
hoping to improve their sea-
son record of two wins
against four losses. will in-
vade the Yankee Conference
tomorrow in an intersectional
battle. with the University of
Connecticut Huskies. It is the
first encounter between the
two teams, and will be play-
ed in Storrs, Conn.

“This is good intersection
al competition.”’ said David-
son Coach Homer Smith.
“I'm glad to see us visit
other strong conferences.
The Yankee Conference is
one of the stronger confer
ences in that area. They have
a lot of talent to choose
from.”

Connecticut is 2-2 for the

season. Their wins were over
Vermont and Maine. and
their losses were to Yale and
Massachusetts.

The Huskies rely strongly
on their quarterback. Pete
Petrilla, for much of their
offense. He is the strongest
rusher for Connecticut. Smith
said. and he is an accom-
plished passer. ‘‘He's the key
factor in their offense."
Smith added.

Petrilla’s favorite target is
George Crisp. a split-end who
has caught 75 per cent of the
team’s completions.

“In comparison, they put
more stress on their run-
ning attack, much more
than we have in the past,”
said Smith. “We have al.
ways had a strong passing

Davidson’s soccer team
battled two teams
through overtimes this
week and scored ties in
both games to bring the

season record to 3-1-3.
Wednesday Davidson met
Belmont Abbey here, and
fought the visitors to a 1-1
deadlock. Both teams’ of-

fenses lagged through most °

of the first half.

Late in the first half the
‘Cat offense began to click,
but the Abbey defense held
Davidson scoreless through
the first half. The ‘Cats
took several shots, all of
which were blocked by the
Abbey’s goalle, whom Da-
vidson Coach Harry Fogle-
man described as “‘the best
Ive ever seen.”

Then in the second half the
Abbey scored after Davidson
goalie Jeff Plainer was injur-
ed. Belmont then held David-
son until the final minutes
of the game, when ‘Cat for-
ward Alfonso Carillo. a Rich-
ardson Scholar from Ecuador,
scored on a penalty kick.

The game ended after a
scoreless double overtime.

“This is the best game
we've played all year," Fo-
gleman said. ‘‘We had a lot
of shots but their goalie was
always there.”

Members of the team
agreed. “We were passing
a lof better and had short-
er and closer shots,” said
inside forward Bill Horton.
Alfonso and Simon Bell (a
Richardson Scholar from
Great Britain) played their
usual fine games. Roger
Peterson heiped out by
beating his man around the
wing several times.”

Observers gave halfback
Cliff Patterson credit for
sparking the Wildcat defense.

ing well.

Last Saturday the ‘Cats
traveled to Charleston, S. C..,
to meet the Bulldogs of The
Citadel. Davidson cruised on
top for most of the game,
until a Bulldog forward boot-
ed in a goal in the final per-
iod to deny the ‘Cats a win.

Carillo led off the scoring
in the first half. booting in
two goals for the ‘Cat effort.

Bell then added another in
the third quarter to give the
‘Cats their final point. The
game ended in a 3-3 tie,

Davidson tried to wear
down the Bulldog team by
freely substituting throughout
the game. ‘'We have a great

Davidson scored to tie ‘the

score. .

The TD came on a pass

With the exception of

pecially in the fourth quar-

never able to shake off the
bad effects of the third
quarter and mount enough
scoring drives. Davidson

did score once in the final
quarter, however.

State’s freshman squad was
a_ balanced. well-disciplined
team which was skilled in
both offense and defense. The
Wolfpack held tenaciously
against a Davidson threat in
the first quarter, and again
in the fourth quarter held the
‘Kittens to short gains.

State was able to hold
ground in key plays, such as
third and fourth down plays.

The second half saw the

NCAA Punt Rule Brews
Cauldron Of Controversy

By ROCKY CROSSWHITE
Sports Writer

The new NCAA punt rule, inaugurated this season by the association’s rules
committee, has stirred up a wave of controversy among coaches throughout the

nation.

Many coaches believe the
rule, which prehibits the five
interior linemen from cross-
ing the line of scrimmage
before the ball has been punt-
ed, is detrimental to football.
while others feef it livens up
the game.

Before this year, linemen
on the kicking team were
free to run downfield to
cover punts as soon as the
ball was snapped. Now
only the backs and ends
may rush the receiver be-
fore the kick. The rules
committee reasoned that
this change would encour-
age receivers to return the
ball rather than signal for
a fair catch.

Several coaches, including
West Virginia’s Coach Jim
Carlen, have criticized the
new rule. vehemently. In an
interview with THE DAVID-
SONIAN this week. Carlen
said, ‘I was against the rule
when it was made and after
five games I am even more
against it.”

Carlen rejected the idea
that the rule makes the
game more exciting. “Kick-
Ing out of bounds or in the
stands can hardly be con-
sidered exciting.” Carlen
also sald he saw more ex.
citing punt returns last
year.

“A minority changed the
punt rule last year’’ Carlen
added, ‘‘and I certainly hope
there is enough resentment

against it so it is changed
next year.”

But several coaches sup-
port the rule. Mary Levy.
head football coach at Wil-
liam and Mary said, ‘‘I hope
the rules committee sticks by
the rule."" Levy said he be-
lieves the same coaches who
want to retract the new punt
rule also want to move the
goal posts up to the goal line.
where they are in pro
leagues. ‘‘These coaches who
object to this rule are offen-
sively minded and use their
objection to the rule as a
smoke screen to hide their
real feeling about advantages
for the offense,"” Levy said.
The new rule will encourage
the need for a good kicking
game, he said, and this will
be good for football.

Frank Howard, head foot-

ball coach at Clemson, is
not as outspoken about the
rule as Carlen, but he said,
“| hate to see this rule take
away the chance for any
glamor the offensive line-
men have to be a standout
for the crowd by leading
the pack down the field
after the ball carrier. This
rule takes this away.”

Howard said he feels the
rule was not needed. It gives
the advantage to the superior

team because the inferior
team ends up punting more
often, he argued. ‘‘The rule
makes our punt returns so
inconsistant, and even though
we average about ten yards
a return, it doesn’t add that
much to the game.” Howard
said.

Clemson ran back a punt
for a touchdown against
Georgia this season, but Au-
burn did the same thing to
Clemson the following week.

The main objection to the
rule seems to be that it
causes more injuries be-
cause it gives the defensive
backs a chance to double
bleck on the few offensive
men coming down the field.
Carlen sald two of his best
players were injured in the
Syracuse game on punt re-
furn plays and are out for
the season.

“Five men were blocking
on two of our players,"’ he
said, ‘‘and one boy received
a severe concussion while an-
other had his left arm brok-
en.’ Levy said he has not
seen any evidnece of increas-
ed injury due to this new
tule. ‘‘Clemson has been
lucky.” Howard said. ‘So
far we haven't had any in-
juries on the punt returns.”
