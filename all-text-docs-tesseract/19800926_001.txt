Development staff undermanned

By ELIZABETH KISS
News Editor

Davidson’s Development De-
partment begins this fall with
five full-time professional staff
mebers instead of the seven it
had last year. The Department
manages the fundraising activi-
ties of th College.

College President Samuel
Spencer emphasized its impor-
tance in the College’s operation.
‘Money is the question all over
the country, Spencer said, ‘‘My
principle emphasis will be on

development from here on.”

The staff shortage results
from the departure last spring
of Vice President for Develop-
ment Duane Dittman, Develop-
ment Officer Alan Lee, and
Secretary of the Parents’ Coun-
cil and Board of Visitors
Matthew Covington.

The search for a new Vice
President is ‘‘still in progress,”
Spencer said. Originally, the
plan was to choose Dittman’s
successor first so that the new
Vice President could assist in

Town nuclear evacuation plan in works

By DONALD CALDWELL
Staff Writer

Town officials are now com-
pleting a plan to evacuate
Davidson in case of nuclear
accident. _

The plan will be tested some-
time during the month of De-
cember in a community evacua-
tion drill.

The drill, to be conducted
with Huntersville and Corne-
lius, is required by federal law
for the licensing of Duke Pow-
er’s McGuire Nuclear Plant,
which is located six miles north

Dean Will Terry complements some rafters on their choice of headgear,

of Davidson.

Davidson Mayor Nancy Mac-
Cérmac emphasized that the
drill will involve primarily the
town’s police, fire and civil
defense personnel.

MacCormac, however, is un-
sure about student involve-
ment. ‘‘No decision has been
made as yet as to the number of
students, if any, who might be
asked to participate,’’ she said.

The drill will extend over a
two day period, though Mac-
Cormac anticipates no major
disruptions of municipal ser-

vices during that time. She also
said any student participation
would be voluntary.

‘The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission now requires each
state to draft an evacuation
plan coordinating more detailed
plans at county and local levels
of government,’’ MacCormac
said.

‘“While the North Carolina
draft has been completed, the

Mecklenburg County and Dav- ©

idson municipal plans are still
being written.”’

selecting a development officer.

“Tf (the search) goes on much
longer,’’ Spencer said, ‘‘we may
choose a development officer
first.”’

Spencer said he has not
interviewed any Vice President-
ial applicants yet and has no
specific target date for final
selection.

The delay in selection is not
unusual, Spencer said. ‘That
kind of hiatus takes place in
colleges all the time.”

In the interim, Director of
Special Resources Julius Mel-
ton has unoffically assumed the
duties of the Vice President.

The staff shortage ‘‘does have
some effect’’ on the depart-
ment’s efficiency, Spencer said.

‘You don’t notice it (the
shortage) as much during the
summer,’’ Melton said, ‘‘but: it
really starts coming home to
you in the fall.’’ Especially
difficult, according to Melton,
is the Living Endowment cam-
paign, a drive to raise funds
from alumni, which lasts from
September through December.
In such times of concentrated
effort, he said, ‘‘you really
begin to experience the frustra-
tion.”

Wearing two hats does have
its drawbacks, Melton admit-
ted. Time limitations prevent
some of the extra initiative
necessary to attracting new
donors. ‘‘People aren’t usually
beating the door down (to give
funds),’’ Melton said. ‘Every
year we have to scramble more
for money.” Time constraints
are ‘‘not helping the college
ultimately.”

Melton said the duties of
Covington, whose position has
been discontinued, and of Lee
have been divided among the
rest of the department. Lee’s
area of specialty was raising
capital funds, which are in-
vested rather than spent by the
College.

The addition of Marcia De-
Sieno as Research Assistant
will ease the staff shortage,
Melton said. DeSierto will iden-

Student participation in Trustee decisions extant, but not direct.

becomes the official policy of the College.

What role do students have in this
process?

The College Constitution mandates
that students be accorded ‘‘clearly
defined means of participation in the
formation and, where appropriate, the
application of College policy.”

Today, student participation includes
the membership of students on various

advisory committees and the official
attendance of one student —the SGA
president—at Trustee meetings. Unin-
vited students cannot attend Trustee
meetings.

Other schools have varying ap-
proaches to involving students in the
making of policy. At one extreme is
Emory, which allows no student input at
its trustee meetings. :

At the other extreme is the University
of North Carolina system. Under the
Open Meetings Law, the governing
bodies of all public universities in North
Carolina must allow unrestricted public
attendance at their meetings, except
when they go into executive session to
discuss personnel and other sensitive
matters.

Private colleges determine for them-

selves who attends trustee meetings. ‘‘I
wouldn't have much objection to open
meetings,’’ College President Samuel
Spencer said. ‘‘A lot of colleges do it.”

Spencer emphasized, however, that

such a switch ‘‘doesn’t depend on me.

It’s up to the Trustees.”

SGA President Dave Waddill will
attend next week’s Trustee meeting with
basically the ‘‘same rights’’ as the
Trustees themselves, except the right to
vote. He is the only student given this
privilege.

Other students may be invited to
attend, but their primary function is to
report on specific issues the Trustees are
considering. These students testify on
limited concerns, while Waddill can
advocate student positions on a variety
of issues. They attend on an ad hoc

basis, while Waddill attends regularly.
Waddill, then, is an important link
between student opinion and Trustee
policy.

Does this system of limited participa-
tion allow for) student input in policy
decisions? To what extent are Trustees
in touch with student sentiment?

Trustees attend three two-day meet-
ings at the College each year. During
this time they not only participate in
official. meetings, but they also meet
informally with students and faculty.
For example, the Trustees will have
lunch at the Patterson Court houses so
they can discuss issues with students.

Williams College has similar pro-
cedures of informal trustee visits to
campus and closed trustee meetings. A
