THE THANKSGIVING DAY.

Tomorrow's game is all the talk.
Everyone has a guess to make as to the
results, only to be disputed by the next
man. But on one thing nearly all agree:
that is, that the whole Student Body
will be there to see Davidson win.

From all indications it will be a close
battle. Clemson has a strong team. It
outweighs Davidson several pounds to
the man. During the past week the
players have been going thru strenuous
practice, and their coach has been strain-
ing every effort toward their final game.
On the other hand the Red and Black,
tho lighter, more than makes up for
weight in speed and teamwork.

Tho the game will be no walkover,
Davidson probably has the edge on her
opponents if records go to show any-
thing. Clemson managed to hold Cita-
del to a close score, whereas Davidson
outplayed her thruout the game in
straight football, the score being tided by
means of a forward pass of 40 vards.
V. M. I. who was defeated by U. of
Va., won from Clemson 43 to 7, while
D. C. “outplayed Virginia both on of-
fensive and defensive.” —

And tho this should inspire confidence,
overconfidence, no pep meetings, and
lack of interest, will spell defeat. So
we predict a hard fight, a lot of pep, and
a true Thanksgiving Day for Davidson.

IDEALS OF PUBLIC OFFICERS.

It is a fine thing to have individual
opinions and ideals, and a country or
section or college is fortunate in having
men who have thought about the ques-
tions of the day and settled upon plans
for action. There is a danger, however,
in carrying this trait of individuality too
-far and finally becoming obstinate and
set in our wavs. We are all good Amer-
icans and theoreticaly abide by the will
of the majority, but practically—we do
not. When questions concerning the
public welfare are discussed we have a
chance to state our views and to try to
influence public opinion, but after thev

in spite of our protestations we should
abide by the will of the majority and
uphold its decisions.

A man may have ideals that are high
enough now, but when he is placed, in
positions of honor and responsibility, his
ideals should grow to fill his new posi-
tion. A professor necessarily has to in-
sist upon a severer code of behavior in
the class-room than at his home in the
evening. Unless a man’s ideals and
standards develop and expand in direct
ratio to the position to which he has been
raised, he is unworthy of that position.

w.

A GOING OUT.

Every true American should have an
abundance of expression for the many
mercies we have received since last
Thanksgiving. Of the many things his
mind should go out in lavish expression
for his appreciation of peace, prosperity,
and for the acute sense of national con-
sciousness which is permeating our whole
life as a nation and as a people. Never
in the history of the modern era or: in
any other age kas the spirit of “Service
First” been so predominant, and surely
this is a blessing which has results in-
numerable.

The college man should be thankful
for these and more. We should be
thankful that American college students
have not!had to humiliate the training
and accomplishments’ of the intellect be-
fore baser and horrible things. The
collegiate world is a great system. Our
sympathies should go out in tender cords
to the less fortunate system of Europe.

Not only this, but the Davidson Col-
lege man glories in the fact that one
who is of our number is to lead and
mould our national consciousness — for
another term of four years. We glory,
that he, a former college professor and
college president, and now a man of af-
fairs, is doing all in his power to al-
leviate the tendencies of demagogism
and to put our nation on the highest
level to which any nation ever aspired.

PROFITABLE LECTURES ON

IMPORTANT SUBJECTS | examen

On Thursday the Student Body had By their F VITS ye

the privilege of hearing two profitable
lectures given by Dr. F. N. Seerley, a
nrofessor in the Y. M. C. A. College at
Springfield, Mass. Dr. Seerley is mak-
ing a tour of the Southern colleges lec-
turing on “Sex Education and Hygiene,”
under the direction of the International
Committee of the Y. M, C. A. The
first of the lectures given here was to the
Freshman class, in which he discussed the
general topic of health and the ways and
means of maintaining it. At the regular.
Y. M. C. A. meeting at 7 o'clock he
gave a fuller lecture on the problems of
sex and in an after lecture to a small
group of the students he went more
fully into the discussion, answering a
number of questions in regard to vari-
ous phases of his subject. Later a few
interviews were held with a number of
the individual students in regard to spe-
cial questions or problems along this
line. Dr. Seerley speaks from a wealth
of experience and study as a physician
and a teacher, and his talks were both
interesting and profitable.
