LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Students Excoriate Hobbie
For Anti-Fraternity Column

To The Editor:

The Hobbie name _ continues
to be as abhorrent to us as
ever. Todd Hobbie’s article,
however, has done nothing to
change our minds. In fact, la-
tent violence has replaced mild
nausea.

It is obvious that one of Hob-
bie’s outstanding qualities is
that of perception—after all, he
wasn’t fooled by fraternities.
No sir. Most of his classmates
were fooled, but certainly not
Todd Hobbie. Well seniors,
what’s your excuse? Do you en-
joy being called fools?

Todd was fortunate because
he had the opportunity to listen
to the wise counsel of that great
sage and soothsayer Peter Hob.
bie, his brother. But we aren’t
writing about Peter for he is
gone (thank God). Now all we
are waiting for is the fond de
parture of Todd.

Rejoice frat men! Todd for-
gives you for being led astray
like vestal virgins into the
clutches of the fraternity wol-
ves. It could happen to any nor-
mal, decent, bright, perceptive,

respectable young man, which
is probably why it never hap-
pened to Hobbie.

Perhaps the real point of this
letter (other than showing Hob-
bie to be a complete ass) is to
show how Hobbie’s (as well as
other frat-busters) fanatical
hatred has distorted the issues.

It is good that there are ‘‘via-
ble alternatives” to fraternities.
However, this does not mean
that fraternities need be de-
stroyed. What could be more
egotistical and  close-minded
than removing fraternities from
Davidson merely because some
people don’t believe in them.

There are people who do and
they should be given the op-
portunity to join a fraternity.
I don’t think Mr. Hobbie realizes
that students are not coerced
into joining fraternities. Then
again, we can understand why
Hobbie has not been strongly
rushed. How can you rush God?

Mr. Hobbie. upon reading
your article we thought at first
that vou were a subversive ele-
ment in our “progressive col-
lege community.” After our

tempers cooled, we_ realized
that you are only a poor, mis-
guided, paranoid egotist.

It is increasingly obvious that
your article was a sham and
really does not deserve a re-
ply, but to make sure that no
one is fooled and to let you
know that we would like to
take an active part in burning
you, this letter is written.

In closing this letter we want
to apologize for making this a
personal attack, but Mr. Hob-
bie set the rules of the game
when he personally attacked
fraternities.

Mr. Hobbie, if you would get
your head together you would
realize that fraternities don’t
like you very much either.

HIRST

November 5, 1971

(that’s in the art department,
remember?) presents the third
in a row of, with promises of
more to come, simply good art.

From now until November 20,
the works of Tucker Cooke, pro-
fessor of art at the University
of North Carolina at Asheville
will be on display. ,

The Work. Well the work is
enough to excite a homeric ca-
talogue of elephants, airborne
fish, rhinoceroses, clothed and
unclothed ladies (we thought
you’d go for that). But perhaps
to see how this all fits together,
you must see the show.

Cooke uses oil paint and pen-
cil as his media. In his draw-
ings, a figure merges into one
object, becomes _ another
through the flow of the picture.
The grotesque is passed off as
the natural. See if you can find
a figure with a_ six-fingered
hand.

His paintings are somewhat

different. Unlikely images arc
presented along side each other.
The contrasting images make
suggestions at meaning but al-
ways leave you hanging.

The paintings are realistic to
the extreme. Cooke’s style is
photographic. His colors are of-
ten the shades of grey of black
and white photography.

All of the pictures maintain
this photographic exactitude
which heightens the allusion to
reality. Think of photographs
and you think of the exact re-
production of reality.

Then look at the bizarre com-
binations — What mental con-
nections need to be made?
Cooke doesn’t provide an answer
and perhaps his titles suggest
that he could be laughing at you
for trying.

There will be a gallery talk
on Wednesday, November 10
for the purpose of seeing just
what Tucker Cooke is about.

PhiGamm Name Qualified;
Student Poll Unacceptable

To The Editor:

I am writing to you on be-
half of the brothers of Delta
Kappa Chapter of the Frater-
nity of Phi Gamma Delta to
request that you cease using
the name of our organization
when referring to the structure
on Patterson Court presently
being used for Hungry d ac-
tivities.

As you are well aware, Phi
Gamma Delta has ceased all
operations on Patterson Court,
and, until the completion of our
off-campus lodge in early 1972,
there is not a ‘“‘Phi Gamm
House” in Davidson.

We, therefore, request that
our name not be associated with
something we take no part in.

May we suggest that you call
upon THE COMPUTER to ‘‘ran-
domly assign” a name to the
structure on Patterson Court?

To The Editor:
I would like to object to the

manner in which the ‘student
referendum” was held recently.
As I understand the method, the
election official came along the
hall sometime during the after-
noon accepting ballots from
those around.

We had no way of knowing
when we would be or whether ~
we had yet been polled in as
much as no ballot or offering
of a place to vote was left my
roommate, who wasn’t in.

By mere chance I happened
to come back to my room for
2 book at the time my hall was
polled or else I would have
been disenfranchised along with
everyone else who had a Tues-
day lab, a job, a long lunch, or
who for any other reason did
not come back to their room
in the afterneon.

While this may be a fair
method of holding a poll, I con-
Sider it unacceptable for a con-
Stitutional referendum.
