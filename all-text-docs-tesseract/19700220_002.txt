Fadicial Scramble:
Niagical Mystery. lour

is the Davidson system “turning
and turning in the widening gyre?”
Are things failing apart? Can the
center hold?

These questions suggested by Yeats’
poem “The Second. Comng™ arise
-out ef the confusion thal boggles ihe
minds of beholders and participants
alike when some aspects ‘of, the Da-
vidson Code of Responsibility are he-
ing considered.

Although the Code is not due for
ils own second coming until lafer this
spring, the bewildering complexities
around parts of it. especially the
parts dealing with the judiciary, have
surfaced once again this week m two
separate incidents that are indeed
Stranger than the Code itself.

The first of these,events was the
administrative decision of last week
to cease publication of transcripts of
‘court proceedings.

These transcripts, are required by
the Code. Thus vou.may imagine the
bewilderment of several studeris
last weck when they were told in the
Dean of Students’ office that such
transcripts did not and woulde not
ever exist (a. decision madé at an
-even higher level). eo
__Jt was.not—long- before—a—few—of—
these students who cdo know the Code
pointed that fact out to the higher
members of the Davidson adininistra-
tion. And it was within, an equally
short time-thaf these same admin-
istrators discovered that ves, indeed.
the publication of transcripts was re
quired..So if the Davidson judiciary
seems sirange to you, take heart. it
catehes a lot of people by surprise.

Perhaps the person most surprised
by, the system last week was the

Junior who experienced what may
be remembered as the shortest legal
career in Davidson's history.

Jt all started when one member of
the Court of°Appeals found he would
not be on campus for the Spring terin
or for next year. He is now. a Sopho-
more.

Realizing someone would have ‘o
replace him on the court. our Sopho-
more in question talked to our, Junior
in question since he. knew that the
Junior fad expressed a desire 10 be
on the court. ; :

The two of them decided. that ine
Junior could replace the Sophomore
on the court. It was all very convea-
jent since the Junio? would graduate
next year leaving the vacancy for the
Saphomore to fill when he returned
to zclool two years from now.

Wfien he had settled such details,
the Jitnior dressed up, went to a
meeting of the Court of Appeals, in-
troduced himself to everyone. and
actually participated in court discus
sion.

After the meeting, regular mein-
bers-efthe-cofrt were still scratching
their heads. Where had this new mem-_
ber received his position?

A little quick research turned up -

the whole story. It also turned up
the requirement in the Code that the
replacement should have been a Soph-
omore in the first place, and should

“have been appointed by the Senate

Executive Committee in any event.
So to our thwarted Junior we can
omy say: “Keep the faith. Perhaps
the next time a Code technicality will
save your face. Who knows what mys-
teries lurk in the heart of the Code?”

A New Trend

\f they do not scorn jiraise (and
some do not)..and if they will accept
it from THE DAVIDSONIAN and.
some. will), we .would like to thank
and commend the members of the
Eumenean Society for organizing the
symposium on “Science and the Hu-
manities.” ;

The programs -were- interesting to
many, valuable to some and perhaps
inspiring .to a few of the students
who attended them.

But beyond the content of this
one symposium. we would like to
thank the Eu Society for seeing fit
to use the talents of some of David-
son's eminently qualified faculty in
this manner.

The increasing trend toward using
our own faculty in symposia this year
has been a highly worthwhile shift
from the trends of faculty utilizaiton
in the past.

The old chapel requirement used

to hurt chances for a program of this
sort by boring the students with a
succession of poor-speakers until they
were not likely to see any other speak-
ers no matter how good or well liked
they were. And outside of chapel, stu-
dents could only hear major talks
delivered by. visiting lecturers because
such use of our own faculty was un-
heard of.

~

There are a great many of our
faculty who should be allowed to ex
change ideas with students who might
never darken the door of. one of their
classes.

Instead of burying our faculty on
committees, traffic courts or similat
wastes of their talent, we should give
them the opportunity to help all the
students and exchange ideas outside
the classroom, lab or court, as it were.

And the Eumenean Society sym-
posium is a good-step in that direction.

-~ A-Word-Of Thanks

While we are on the subject \of
college personnel we would like to
express along overdue word of thanks
to Dr. Ostwalt for. his efficiency in
~ handling course registration. ;
- Under the normal circumstances

well for most students. Explanatory
information is usually quite clear,
mailed sufficiently in advance for stu-.
-dents-to-make their plans and com-
plete enough so that often actual reg-
istration is only a matter of minutes.

We realize that there are flaws in
the system and some students are up-
set every term by the way their regis-
tration turned out. Most students
survive relatively unscathed.

But such events are in normal cir-
cumstances. Can we expect the same
in periods when there are unusual
problems and requirements surround-
ing registration? The events of the
past week seem to indicate that we
can. —_

here is no denying that registra-
tioh for the spring term was conduct-
ed under unusual circumstances. The
entry of many of the freshmen and
sophomores into a third course in the

spring overloaded .a number of the
courses and professors assignments
that had been planned for the term.
This glut of students caused a num-
ber of administrative problems for
the registrar's office. And to Dr. Ost-

Anyone who has carried a phoblem
to Dr. Ostwalt knows the value of his
personal attention. But should not
some of the more petty problems be
taken from his hands?

And those who roam Chambers late

is forced to keep to stay ahead of the
registration problems. But should a
man with three degrees be forced

It is our opinion that some of this

The college is not going to

dent of the Educational
Testing Service, has pre-
dicted just such a trend.

Says Turnbull, ''As educa-
tion becomes truly  indi-
vidual, the importance of
external examinations such’
as the national ‘normed’ col-
lege admission tests will
fade away.”

Mr. Turnbull believes that +
new means of testing would
be employed to give “a
more humane method" for
considering the applieant’s
educational abilities.

‘Martin Katz, also a mem-
ber of ETS, spoke at the

increased use of computeriz-

dents, and called for a
‘greater emphasis on the

Mentay Machicolations

-Monday was a-bad day. for students who expect—

great. thing; of their political system. Some of them
will grit ther teeth the next time a party politico .
heralds the virtues of the “democralic system.’
Students see politics as a means to desirable ends:
the established men of the-society see politics as ones
of ihe factors that insure the status quo and their

pos tion in it.

Queen City” is a palaee built on a questioning. inter-
csled. concerned political icadership is purely illusory.

Even the Young Turks seem to have stayed too
long in the tents of their.respective sultans. How can
a young maa go against whal’s good for the law firm
or the bank or the insurance company?

Surely a little conviclion is too small a thing to.

to win, not to look out after the country. : ~~
Parties thrive on winning and on loyalty to the

party as an end in itself: “I'm a Democrat: I have to

.
What about the rhetoric that says, ‘Students of-
fer fio alternatives, they just criticize?” Bunk. Wheels
want cheerleaders not critics. They want pretty child-
ren who think their materialist culture is neaty-keen.

that they can ever be overcome.
