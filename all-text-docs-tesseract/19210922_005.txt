these were impressed with the Hart-

Schaffner and Marx suits and top coats. |

his great-grandfather, the famous Nasr-

looks—a_ fact which troubled him
greatly.

One day he studied his features in a
glass attentively for some time and
then, dismayed by his ugliness, began to
weep.

At once the Court Fool began weep-

ing also, and even when, after lamenting
