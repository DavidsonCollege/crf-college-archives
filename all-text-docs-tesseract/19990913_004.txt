Levering’s book describes difference made by ‘‘Do-er’’ parents

By CoLLEGE COMMUNICATIONS

When Daviieon history professor Ralph Le-
vering assures students that committed individu-
als can make a difference in world affairs, he can
point to his own family tree for examples.

Levering’s parents, Sam and Miriam Lever-
ing, spent more than 12 years of their lives con-
vincing, cajoling and communicating with repre-
sentatives from more than 140 countries around

. the world to craft and implement the Law of the
Sea treaty. This devoutly religious couple who
tended an apple

gift designated for work on Law of the Sea, and
asked Sam to take the job for a year. Because a
terrible winter freeze had killed his apple crop, he
accepted readily. Miriam went with him to Wash-
ington, D.C. Their joint salary was
only $12,000, but the Leverings were
very frugal people.

“My parents believed any money
they had should be directed to the
causes they supported,” explained
Ralph Levering. “They didn’t rent an
apartment, but saved money by liv-

“My parents were world peace advocates,”
Levering explained. “They were deeply involved
with the World Federalist movement from the
1930s through the 1950s, advocating a federalist
system binding all countries under a central world
government with limited power.”

Levering remembers a steady stream of no-
table figures and enthusiastic students visiting the
Levering farm throughout his childhood. His par-
ents helped found the United World Federalist
organization in 1947 in Asheville, and they were
very active in peace initiatives throughout the
state. Sam Levering, a Quaker, traveled the state
debating the subject with figures like the famous
political scientist Hans Morgenthau and H-bomb
creator Edward Teller. His willingness to study
issues thor-

it,” explained Ralph Levering. “My parents big-
gest contribution was to help the consensus move
forward.”

They did that through publication of a news-
paper called “The Neptune,” and by producing
more than fifty seminars for delegates that fea-
tured experts in technical issues of mining, inter-
national negotiation and other pertinent subjects.
By maintaining their neutrality on contentious
issues and acting as “friends of the conference”
rather than lobbyists for a particular point of view,
the Leverings earned the respect and trust of all
delegates and acted as catalysts on many initia-
tives. They also worked hard at raising funds for
their work at the conference, and were rewarded
by substantial funding and involvement from the
United Methodist Church, the Sierra Club, and
other groups.

One major point of contention in negotia-
tions was the insistence of Third World countries
that industrialized nations share both the bounty
of undersea mining and the technological know-
how to achieve it. The U.S. and many other na-
tions vehemently opposed the forced sharing of
technology, and negotiations on that point were
rocky and sharp.

Miriam Levering, a Methodist who had be-
come a Quaker, was equally intelligent, driven and
affable. As a believer in educating for peace, she
made an annual trip to the United Nations and to
Washington with North Carolina high school stu-
dents. During one such visit, she met some U.N.
delegates from Africa who lamented the lack of a
nearby place to socialize and worship. Miriam
turned to her childhood church for support, and led
a successful movement to build a church center at
the U.N. It now towers as a 20-story building at
777 ULN. Plaza.

“My parents were doers,” Ralph Levering
stated.

Having realized by the 1960s that world
federalism was too ambitious an idea, the Leverings
began searching for a cause with a better chance of
success that might still promote peaceful coopera-
tion between nations. In 1970, Dr. Frank Porter
Graham, retired president of UNC and a longtime
friend, told Sam that Law of the Sea, a forthcom-
ing U.N. initiative, presented just such an opportu-
nity.

He found an opportunity to get involved
through the Friends Committee on National Leg-
islation, a Quaker lobbying group in which he long
had been involved. The committee had received a
