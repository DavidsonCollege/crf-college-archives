60's provoke KKK to call Davidson
Communist hot-bed ct

By ANN GARNER
Staff Writer

In the 1960’s, student un-
rest and violence prevailed
throughout the country. Des-
pite every evidence to the
contrary, Davidson College
was labelled during the late
1960’s as being a “‘hot bed of
communism”’ by none other

than the Ku Klux Klan.

In a time when Vietnam was
coming to the far front, when
escalation in war activities
was beginning, and when soc-
ial ferment was the ‘‘fashion”’

DR. PATTERSON’S office may be

the term communism was
thrown out upon various or-
ganizations in a somewhat
haphazard manner.

The Ku Klux Klan was par-
ticularly well-known for their
suspicion of institutions of
higher learning and especially
the “liberal” professors who
spoon-fed ideas into the brains
of their young, college-bound
sons and daughters.

- However, there were several
occurrences at Davidson dur-
ing this period that could very
well have served as roots for

such twisted accusations.

~In what might be considered
direct confrontation with
KKK convictions, Davidson in
1961 became the first private
college in N.C. to accept black
students.

According to then Dean of
Students, Dr. Richard Burts,
however, integration was both
expected and inevitable, being
followed soon after by the
similar actions of both Wake
Forest and Duke.

Another point of controver-
sy arose in the mid-1960’s
when the N.C. legislature
passed, without warning the
Speaker Ban Law. This law
stated in effect that no person
associated with the Commun-
ist Party would be allowed to
speak before students attend-
ing a public university or
college.

In response, a number of
Davidson professors became
involved in seeking the Spea-
ker Ban Law’s repeal as it
affected the notion of academ-
ic freedom and the entire
concept of liberal education.

Compared to other private
and public faculties in N.C.,
Davidson professors were
more active and instrumental.
According to Dr. Burts, state
professors were somewhat
hesitant because of the possi-
bility of receiving direct politi-
cal recrimination. The efforts
of Davidson professors resul-
ted in the law’s eventual
repeal.

DR. PATTERSON feels KKK’s
claim absurd.

In contrast to strong faculty
participation in political af-
fairs, the Davidson student
body of the 1960’s was often
characterized as a ‘‘hot bed of
student rest’’ in relationship
to other student activities
elsewhere. Many speakers
were imported who encour-
aged Davidson students to
become-more politically active
and interested.

There were occasions where
students took an active, visi-
ble interest in political affairs,
though usually participating
in small numbers. Yet, it is
generally recognized that most
Davidson students were, ac-
cording to Dr. J. B. Stroud,
“part of the establishment’’
and therefore take a more
subdued interest in political —
affairs.

Their participation took the
form of ‘‘responsible protest”
usually without a great deal of
disruption and showing con-
sideration for others. Perhaps
the better term would be
““polite’’ protest.

In the late ’60’s, however,

-Steve Lewis

Davidson barbershop practi-
ces were brought to the sur-
face, arousing a great deal of
student protest. The Davidson
barbershops were run by black
men who refused from the
economic standpoint to cut the
hair of black people during
business hours.

Upon discovering this fact
the pickets descended and the
student protestors fired with
the enthusiasm of healing a
grave injustice. They organi-
zed a protest in front of Ralph
Johnson’s barbershop.

They succeeded but within a
short period of time Ralph
Johnson, with the advent of
long hair coupled with local
refusal to obtain haircuts
where black heads were cut,
was forced to close his shop.

Clearly, the evidence points
to the fact that ‘‘liberalism”’
primarily among professors
was then equated with ‘‘com-
munism in the eyes of KKK”’.
The idea that Davidson Col-
lege was ever a ‘‘hot bed of
communism” is as Dr. Burts
described, ‘‘preposterous’’.
