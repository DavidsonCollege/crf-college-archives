of our Dumb Fresh was shooting. He shot
50 times and didn't even graze the target.
The captain got sore.

“You couldn't hit an aeroplane hanger !
Go behind that tree and shoot yourself in
the head!”

The Fresh faded from sight.

In a minute a shot was heard from the
direction of the tree.

The captain went white and sprinted mad-
ly toward it. Just as he reached it a powder-
smoked face peered around the trunk and

recognition of his ability, he was initiated
into the Reporters’ Club. His Sophomore
year he helped in the editorial. department,
was awarded the Golden Quill, the highest
honor given by the Reporters’ Club, and in
the spring was appointed managing editor,
which position he has filled with great credit
to himself. During that year also he origi-
nated the idea of a Chaff column, which has
become a regular column in the paper and
has remainder under his super-
vision. Even in the summer Smith has been
getting experience and valuable newspaper
information by working on a large Southern
daily.

He has been actively engaged in dramatic
work, having had one play produced this |
year, and with two more to be produced this
spring. He was elected a member of Sigma
Upsilon honorary fraternity last fall.

Under Smith, The Davidsonian should go
forward at a rapid rate. He is a man well
fitted for his position both by his experi-

personal

‘ence and natural ability. Che paper begins |

which has handicapped this year’s staff. It!
is already recognized as the best college}
newspaper in the state and it is quite pos- |
sible for the editor-elect to realize his goal |

by making it the best in the South.

pose being to march through this aforesaid
