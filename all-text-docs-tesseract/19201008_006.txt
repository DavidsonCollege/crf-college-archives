THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 8, 1920.

Christian Activities

VOLUNTEERS CELEBRATE.

Excellent Feed Enjoyed By All
Members of Band.

At ten o'clock Friday night the
door of the Literary Science room
was thrown open to Thirty-six Stv-!
dent Volunteers and their friends.

’ During the hour that followed there i
was continuous capturing and con-.
suming of confections and sodas.

After every trace of the table dec- ;
orations were wiped out, a contest of '
wit and near-wit was called. In 30
minutes all jokes from Grandfather -
Adam to Hughjohn were thorough-
ly aired. “Junebug” Price and
Hugh Smith won by a unanimous
vote and were awarded the privilege
of cleaning up after the feed.

There was another side to the feed
tho—when things sobered down!
several Volunteers urged their fel-_
low members to look upon life se-;
riously, not as an ascetic but as
Jesus Chris€ who was a man among
men, and to do everything in their
power to make Davidson and the
world better.

Recognizing the benefits of such
a gathering the Band voted another
feed before Christmas, and thanked
“Mac” Richards and “Bill” Manze
for their efforts in getting up the

The same enthusiastic — spirit,
which prompted the building of the
chapel, still exists among the mem-
bers of its loyal congregation, All
the men who have labored there
have shared in the whole-hearied
spirit of the community.

At present the pulpit is unfilled,
jbut the co-operative work of its
!supporters has allowed no slack in

,attendance averages above 90, avd
the Christian Endeavor has almost
as high a percentage.

Shearer Chapel is one of the
strongest and most promising Sun-

students hikes out to conduct the
services there.

Thru all difficulties this little
church has remained a great factor.

it is evidenced by the hospitality
which these farmer-folk show all
