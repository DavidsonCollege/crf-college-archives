DAVIDSON BATTALION
1S DIGGING TRENCHES

The drilling of the Davidson battalion
is improving each day. ‘he engineering
being completed, the companies have be-
gun to dig trenches in the mornings be-
fore breakfast, instead of drilling. “This
does not seem to be very inviting work.
altho the Davidson men are anxious to
learn military tactics, because they feel
that it is their duty, and that they can
make a success of it also.

About the roth of May several officers
from Camp Greene are expected to ‘come
to Davidson for the purpose of selecting
the best company in military tactics. This
company will be awarded a banner with
the name of the company and its respec-
tive members upon it.

LE CERCLE FRANCAIS.

Les membres du fameux ‘Cercle
Francais” ont etudie assidument la ques-
tion: Que faut-il faire pour apprendre
le francais? [ls semblent tous ne pas
avoir beaucoup de difliculte a repondre
a cette question, et s‘ils pratiquaient
toujours ce qu’ils prechent a cet egard,

tout irait bien. Mails, helas! -Cepend-
ant ecoutes ce qu’ils disent.
“Premierement je crois quil faut

avoir un bon professeur. Je prefererais
pour moi-meme un fort vicil homme, qui
ne soit jamais alle en Europe. Si vous
ne pauvez, pas empecher que votre pro-
fesseur ne voyage en Europe, employe
toute votre habilete pour le’ tromper, et
peut-etre vous y reussirez, “Travaillez
beaucoup au commencement de l'annce
scolaire, et faites de cette facon quil
pense que vous’ sachiez quelque chose.
Acquerez, une bonne reputation. II n’y
a plus a faire. Le professeur vous re-
gardera de temps en temps, et voyant
dans vos yeux plusicurs rayons d’intelli-
gence il sera convaincu, sans vous de-
mander rien, que vous savez, mille choses
que vous ne sivez point.”

“HL faut d’abord que letudiant desire
reellement apprendre le francais. Il
devrait avoir une aptitude pour les lan-
gues, et il faut absolument qu'il veuille
hien travailler. Ensuite une duree suf-
fisante de temps lui est necessaire. Pour
le grand progres il devouera presque tout
le temps a l’etude du francais. Il vaut
mieux, peut-etre, que le professeur Lui-
meme soit francais, mais_si le professeur
francais ne connait parfaitement la lan-
gue anglaise, il ne pourra pas instruire
dune maniere satisfaisante les etudiants
anglais. Pour la prononciation le cravat!
lent et laborieux, la pratique, et latten-
tion dans la classe sont indispensables,
Les livres n'y valent pas beaucoup, mais
Vambition ea la bonne volonte sont. les
choses importantes. En dernier, lieu, i
est bien desirable d’avoir des cerveaux.

well, and plenty in the fighting line and
doing equally well there. 1) wish 1]
could speak freely and tell you about the
work some of them are doing. It is a
wonderful ‘experience to serve here and
Iam glad Loam here and 1 have heard
many of them say the same thing. Lieu-
tenant’: Brownlee was talking to me yes-
terday and said he had gone to school
more since he had been in the army and
done more real hard studying than he

ever did at college, and many more of us’

say the same. You never find any one
here wishing he was elsewhere; there tr
more a feeling of pity for the man wh
is missing it all. Vo have a part in this
stupendous struggle makes all clse we
have ever been in seem insignificant.
Every day we hear from men from all
the allied countries, for we have them
with us and we get firsthand informa-
tion that) makes everything _ realistic.
Frankly, 1 do not see how a young man
can stay at home and miss it all. espe-
cially when he has that wonderful: spice
of youth, for | would rather be a private
at 20 than my present rank at go, and
take a part in the struggle of civilization
against the Hun.

Some of us will never come back to
Dayidson—we know that—but we will
not want to come back unless we have
treedom from the rule of Prussianism
and that is exactly what it  means—we
are-out to win and “won't come home
until its over, over there.”

All Davidson news is eagerly read by
the alumni in camp and | always pass
my copy along to some one who has not
received one, and 1 hope you will fol
low meé with it from time to time as my
address changes. 1 am going over te
the wards to see two Davidson men now.
and LT know they will want the news
from the “Hill” for it is a very dear
place to all of us. and we want you to
give us all the news possible in “Tite
Davipsontan, especially news from the
alumni. | would like to tell you about
the wonderful work the Red Cross is
doing—I marvel at it exery day—it is
one of the most efficient organizations
imaginable, so you need never refuse to
contribute to its fund—the money goes
right to the spot where it is needed.

With every good wish to the paper
and all college activities, I am
